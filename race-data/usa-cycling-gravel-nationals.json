The venue bounces between Nebraska and Minnesota every two years, so local knowledge resets constantly. On the plus side, USA Cycling runs the show with actual organizational competence, and the Apple Festival timing gives you somewhere to eat afterward."

It's not the 200-mile death march that some events throw at you, but six hours of Driftless punishment will find your limits. The distance forces real strategy instead of hero moves, which is exactly what a national championship should demand. Longer than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego. As Zach Nehr puts it: \"I was dropped with two and a half hours to go.

The 'goat track' section near Hokah in 2025 had riders walking, but most of the course rewards power over pure technical wizardry. Similar technical demands to Gravel Worlds.

The Ice Age glaciers missed this area, leaving steep bluffs and ravines that create climbing challenges. It's significantly harder than the Nebraska pancake-flat original course, but won't rival mountain races. Similar elevation profile to Gravel Worlds. As Critical Attack Point puts it: \"And then, something happened that I was completely unprepared for.

September in Minnesota means 50-degree mornings that climb to 70s if you're lucky, or sideways rain that turns 'champagne gravel' into slick misery. The 2025 edition had muddy sections that caught riders off guard despite the usually smooth surface conditions. You'll start in arm warmers and finish in shorts, assuming the weather doesn't decide to punish everyone equally. More weather exposure than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

Lower altitude than Gravel Worlds — no thin-air concerns."

          "transcript": "USA Cycling's gravel national\nchampionships is September 20th here in\nthe drifless region of Minnesota. So,\nwhat are the courses like? The roads,\nthe surfaces, the hills, the topography.\nWhat is the cycling culture like? We\nalong with some locals are going to show\nyou exactly that. Come along for the\nride here in the driftless area of\nMinnesota. There are three courses on\ntap. The 110 has 7,500 ft of elevation\ngain. Most of that in nine distinct\nclimbs that are roughly a mile long and\n500 ft high. The 74 has 5,100 ft of\nelevation gain and five main climbs. And\nthe 31m course has two climbs and just\nshy of 2,000 ft total elevation gain.\nAll three finished on the same circuit\nof the stout chicken ridge gravel climb\nfollowed by a run through an apple\norchard and then into the grounds of a\ngravel core. All three feature the same\nfinal onem climb that averages 8% before\ndescending back down into the crescent.\nMost of the last five miles is paved\nwith a gravel kicker up into a\nneighborhood followed by a steep and\ncurved paved descent down into town two\nturns before the wide open finish on\nMain Street. After 2 years in Garing,\nNebraska, the course here is vastly\ndifferent worlds apart. If someone has\nnot been to this beautiful area, what do\nyou tell them to expect? What is riding\nand racing gravel bikes like here in the\nDrifless region?\n&gt;&gt; I tell them to expect to have their mind\nblown a little bit. Um, you know,\nthere's nothing, I think, more more\nbeautiful, more scenic. Expect hills.\nUm, expect good gravel, but I think the\nthe beauty um of the area is fantastic.\n&gt;&gt; What about visibility? Like last two\nyears in Garing, you could see literally\nfor miles, which is can be a good thing,\ncan be a demoralizing thing depending on\nwhere you are. Here it seems like\nvisibility is quite limited. Do you\nrecommend pre-writing the course or is\nthe type of thing you could just go out\nand enjoy it?\n&gt;&gt; No, you definitely need to pre-ride the\ncourse. You need to know the corners.\nYou need to know where you're going. Um\nwas talking to Chase work about it this\nmorning and you know he's like it's\ngoing to be for sure to my advantage to\ncome out here to know the turns to know\nthe course. Um the gravel is usually\nreally good unless they freshly grade\nit. But if you know where the tight\nturns are in the downhill and how to\nline up for that you're going to have a\nmuch better experience for sure. Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I think for the race for sure especially\nat the pointy end it's going to be one\nof those out of sight out of mind cuz\nit's it's almost like a mountain bike\nrace. It's it's so windy. It's so tight.\nIt's hilly. It's not like you're going\nto see somebody 2 minutes up the road\nand you're just going to be watching\nthat wheel. I think people are going to\ngoing to go and there's enough hills too\num to really break up things and I think\nthat's really going to be a difference\nmaker especially in the in the more\nelite field.\n&gt;&gt; Chase, tell me about the drifless. What\nis the drifless area?\n&gt;&gt; The the geography answers like the it's\na region in southeastern Minnesota like\nsouthwestern Wisconsin and northeastern\nIowa and like northwest Illinois where\nthe glaciers didn't drift through and\nlike flatten the land. And so you have\nthese bluffs with pretty flat ridges on\ntop. Um, and then you have like four 500\nfoot descents into a valley. And usually\nthere's a lot of streams. There's the\nMississippi River that runs straight\ndown the middle of the drifless. Um, and\nI think it's one of the most beautiful\nand underrated parts of the country.\n&gt;&gt; What's your advice to people coming out\nfor gravel nationals?\n&gt;&gt; Get ready for some climbing. I don't\nthink aerodoring out is probably the\nbest. um thing to do. Get ready for some\nreally fast roads. Be prepared to\ndescend. I would make sure you have your\nGarmin like zoomed in. If it looks like\na sharp turn on your Garmin or Wahoo,\nit's going to be sharp. So, I I want\neveryone to be safe. You're not going to\nwin the race on the downhill, but you\ndefinitely could lose it. So, yeah, stay\nwithin your means. And then yeah, when\nyou're in the area, stop at a quick\ntrip, bike along the river. Like I I\nhope people can just ride more than just\nthe gravel. There's a beautiful road\ncalled Apple Blossom just north or out\nof north of Lac Crescent. That's a has a\nbeautiful overview and yeah, that that\nwould be my advice.\n&gt;&gt; Just come enjoy it.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, come and enjoy it.\n&gt;&gt; So, how do you live here? You've ridden\nhere. What are the roads like to ride\nand race on? They're absolutely gorgeous\nin this area. The views are incredible.\nFrom the rolling bluffs to the beautiful\nriver views and valleys um behind us,\nyou'll get some fun farmland, various\ndifferent animals and things out on the\nroad. Our gravel um varies. You will get\nsome beautiful like pristine um\nchampagne gravel and then you can all of\na sudden run upon some um nice chunky\nstuff.\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; So,\n&gt;&gt; what are the hills like? It seems like\nthere's there's some steepness to some\nof these. Like on coming from Colorado,\nit's like, well, no huge mountains, but\nthere's a lot of elevation gain.\n&gt;&gt; The hills around here um are generally\npretty steep, especially on gravel. You\nwill easily get um 10% plus grades. Um\ngenerally they are less than 500 ft\ntotal elevation gain from bottom to top\njust because that's kind of what our um\nMississippi River Valley bluffs are. But\num they can sting a lot. They're that\nkind of death by a thousand cuts. You\nmay not have a two-hour climb, but we\ncan put a whole bunch of rollers right\nnext to each other and um your legs will\nfeel it.\n&gt;&gt; As an expert in in both racing and the\nbicycle itself, what do you recommend\nfolks do as far as gearing and tires?\nAre you going to need a wide I mean\nobviously it's like fitness and personal\npreference come into it, but like what\nis your recommendation for someone who\nis signing up for a national\nchampionships race?\n&gt;&gt; The hills are steep. So, if if you um\nare from a flatter area, you're going to\nwant a lot of gearing, whether that's a\ndouble or a single, you know, mullet\nsetup, big ring in the back, but you're\ndefinitely going to want um a granny\ngear. You're going to need to be able to\nsit and spin. Sometimes the gravel is\njust a little bit loose, too. So, you\nreally can't stand up when it's 20%. Um\nand it's sustained for 5 minutes, and so\nit's not like one of those things where\nyou can kind of punch up it, but like\nyou're climbing for for an kind of an\nextended period. And so, um having the\ngearing for that was definitely going to\nbe helpful. Tire choice, I man, it's\nit's wild. Chase and I spent a while\ntalking about that this morning as well.\nI'm currently riding some 55s and I'm\nabsolutely loving it. But I rode across\nthe state of Minnesota on gravel last\nsummer on 35s. Um so you can do it for\nsure on a skinnier tire. You're going to\nbounce around a lot. You might lose some\ntime on the descents, but um I expect\nthe race to be won on a pretty fast,\npretty slim tire.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Like I'm on 42 just straight\nup slicks today and Yep.\n&gt;&gt; feels fine except for some of those\nloosey goosey corners where I'm\ndefinitely taking it on the more\ncautious side of things. But Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Point is like whatever tires\nyou bring, just\n&gt;&gt; enjoy it.\n&gt;&gt; I for sure you Yeah. No, I'm I'm running\na a fun gravel ride out here um through\nthe bike shop. Um and I just told people\nyou could you could ride a road bike.\nYou know, if you only have a road bike,\nif you have a mountain bike, if you have\na gravel bike, like bring whatever\nyou've got. Just just know there's not\nreally a perfect bike or a perfect tire\nfor for the riding out here.\n&gt;&gt; The race starts and finishes in La\nCrescent, a small town just across the\nmighty Mississippi from Lacrosse,\nWisconsin. And if you like coffee, the\nstart is just steps away from Avagado\nLane. Coinciding with Nationals, La\nCrescent will be hosting its annual\nApple Fest, celebrating the fall harvest\nwith food, drink, and festivities. Since\nthe Crescent is small, most riders will\nstay in Lacrosse, Wisconsin. A vibrant\nthree college town home to a great bike\nculture and many great shops,\nrestaurants, and hotels. We started\nabout 30 years ago, believe it or not,\nis a big race in Wisconsin. Shwamagan 40\nis a lot on gravel roads. So, we'd come\nover here and ride gravel on our\nmountain bikes uh to do that. With this\nrace, it was like looking at all the\nroutes we had and saying, \"Okay, how do\nwe make it work for a course for\nnationals?\"\n&gt;&gt; Um because there's a million neat roads\nhere. The question is, how do you\nconnect the right ones? How do you make\nit something where you can have the\nsupport and everybody enjoys it?\n&gt;&gt; Um so, I think people will be uh\npleasantly surprised when they get here.\nIt's not flat.\n&gt;&gt; Tell me about road service. What do you\nexpect the roads to be like come\nSeptember?\n&gt;&gt; Could be anything. Uh, typically if it's\na good year, you'll have some nice\nsmooth, fast, flat roads. I mean, they\ndo a lot of work right now.\n&gt;&gt; Um, we got out a month and a half ago,\neverything was flat and hard because we\nhad a nice winter. Now, there's a lot of\nloose stuff. They're laying down gravel.\n&gt;&gt; Um, they do that all summer long. By the\ntime nationals get here, it should be in\ngood shape. But, you know, you could get\na you can get a storm, you have some\nnice big ruts in the road. Um we do a\nsection of minimum maintenance road\nlater and that's one of those where they\ndon't do all the maintenance regularly\nso it might be interesting that way but\na lot\n&gt;&gt; as advertised minimum maintenance road.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. A lot of a lot of good fun roads\nbut a lot of variety I think\n&gt;&gt; if you're going to the race in or out of\nMinneapolis. There's all sorts of great\ncycling culture here in the Twin Cities\nincluding Angry Catfish\n&gt;&gt; around Minneapolis. It's a lot of uh a\nlot of city trails. um a really good\ncrew of people that actually ride out of\nthis shop, Angry Catfish. We ride around\nthe lakes, ride around uh to St. Paul,\nup to northeast, all around. Um but\nwe're going to be going down to the\nDrifless region. It's just beautiful. Um\nit's the area that wasn't affected by\nthe glaciers making it all flat. So you\nget these big bluffs that go up 8-minute\nclimbs. You're in a valley um in the\nfarms, see the Amish people on the\nhorses, and then you go down and you're\naround streams and creeks and all the\ntrout fishing. Um so really cool area to\nride\n&gt;&gt; if people are coming in or out of\nMinneapolis on their way to or from\nthere, where is a good spot to get a\nnice beverage in Minneapolis?\n&gt;&gt; Well, um I would say Bow House Brew\nLabs. Um this is uh where I work and\nwe're a good friend of the shop here at\nAngry Catfish. They actually sell some\nof our NA beers. We have we got a a big\ntap room. Uh lots of bikes bike rack\nspace there. Um we actually have a bike\nteam that we sponsor called Hand Up\nRacing that does social rides and you\ncan join on those. They're super fun.\n&gt;&gt; A party forward team is how you\ndescribed it to me.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, very party forward team.\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for making it happen. Thanks,\nsir.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Thanks, man.\n&gt;&gt; In addition to all the cool bikes and\nmerch, inside Angry Catfish, you can\nfind the workshop of Wild Bikes run by\nJeffrey Fra and his team.\n&gt;&gt; Catfish.\nSomeone asked me to build them a bike\nand I was like, \"Yeah, no problem. We\ncan do that.\" And so I didn't have\nanything to do cuz I'd lost my job\nbecause of the pandemic and I ended up\nstarting a bike brand.\n&gt;&gt; How many bikes are you doing in here\nwith your team?\n&gt;&gt; We do production bikes in Taiwan.\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; And that's really, you know, the main\nfocus of the business. And then we have\nour workshop here. And Brad is our\nfull-time frame builder. And we'll build\nbetween 40 and 50 frames here in house.\nWe don't do any welding, so everything\nis either lugged or fillet braced.\n&gt;&gt; Paul's been driving support for us all\nday. Thanks, sir. Appreciate that.\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n&gt;&gt; Where are we now, sir? And what are we\nabout to do? What will Racers be doing\nhere?\n&gt;&gt; Uh, well, we will be climbing up uh one\nof the bluffs.\n&gt;&gt; The racers will actually be racing\nthrough the lanes of apple trees in the\nin the orchards uh followed up by a\ngravel corey. We thought it'd be a great\nlittle uh combination to a show off from\nthe some spots on the top of the bluff.\nYou can actually see the Mississippi\nRiver which is not too far away and uh\nit'll be some pretty sights for the for\nthe racers and for uh for spectators\nalike. So,\n&gt;&gt; and with the race being September 20th\nin the fall, that's Prime Apple season,\nisn't this? Like Apple Fest is going on\nthe weekend of the race going on as\nwell. You can see the apples. Probably\nnot stopping to sample here, but just\ngetting to see where the where the goods\nare coming from.\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\n&gt;&gt; we're at the top of the gravel quarry.\nThere's just not a better way to end uh\nthe gravel national championships than\ngoing through the apple orchard in\nconjunction with Apple Fest and then the\ngravel corey.\n&gt;&gt; We're going through the sources of both\nthings.\n&gt;&gt; Tell us about Apple Fest.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so Apple Fest is long-standing\nfestival uh celebration of the apple\ncapital of Minnesota, which is Lac\nCrescent. And uh um you know just a\ngreat get together celebrating all\nthings apple. Apple pies you know the\ncrumbles, the crisps, the you name it,\nthe cers. Um certainly some beers will\nprobably be drank during that time.\n&gt;&gt; Need some insider info. What's what's\nthe best apple dessert I should be\nrequesting after gravel nationals?\n&gt;&gt; I mean personally I'm a crisp guy. Okay,\n&gt;&gt; so that's that's where I'm going to go\nevery time.\n&gt;&gt; Okay. Straight to the apple crisp.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely. For sure.\n&gt;&gt; Thanks, Jeremia.\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely. Thank you. The 2025 USA\nCycling Gravel National Championships\npresented by Victoria and locally\nchampioned by Explore Minnesota is\nSeptember 20th in Lac Crescent,\nMinnesota.

          "description": "Here we are in La Crescent, MN, just 2 hours away from my home town of Mankato, MN, for the 2025 USA Cycling gravel Nationals. With this being so close to home and on terrain with short to medium punchy climbs that suits my riding style so well, It's safe to say this was the race I was most excited for all season.\n\nSPOILER ALERT HERE: Everything was going perfect to plan, right on Pete and Alexey up the first 4 climbs, and even off the front for a small bit after climb number 4. Then, disaster. I dropped a bottle in Aid 2 and thought I could stop to grab it, but the bottle had exploded. The 7 seconds of stopping time I had here to get another one was Amplified by the fact that it was on a DH and the defending champ was attacking through it, and by the time I got going again it was too late.\n\nSo much \"would have, could have, should have\" with this one, but I will take from this knowlege to learn and grow, as we can often find more growth in our failures than in our successes. \n\n📈 Strava File: https://www.strava.com/activities/15881801429\n_________________________________________\n\nWant to SUPPORT OUR CHANNEL?

All courses finish on the chicken ridge gravel climb through an apple orchard, ending with a final one-mile climb averaging 8 percent grade. The terrain features bluffs with flat ridges and 400-500 foot descents into valleys. Riders emphasize pre-riding is essential due to limited visibility, tight turns, and technical descents. The gravel surface is typically good unless freshly graded. The course is described as windy, tight, and hilly like a mountain bike race.
