        "explanation": "131 miles for the elite distance puts this at the longer end of major gravel races. Long enough to test endurance, comparable to Unbound 200 in distance demands. Multiple distance options (88mi, 56mi, 25mi) serve different categories."

      "technicality": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Driftless gravel is well-maintained 'champagne gravel' but the punchy climbs (10-15% gradients) add difficulty. Not technical singletrack, but the steep pitches and corrugated surfaces require skill. Mountain bike background helps on final technical kicker."

      "elevation": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "6,000-8,000 ft of climbing across the course. La Crescent is described as 'hardest one we've had so far' with more climbing than Gering. Repeated short, steep efforts rather than long sustained climbs. The Driftless punches back."

      "reality": "The Driftless Region looks gentle on paper but delivers relentless punchy climbs—10-15% gradients that hit repeatedly throughout the course. Winners describe it as 'survival' and 'going all out.' The corrugated gravel surfaces punish poor tire choice, and the final technical kicker rewards mountain bike skills.",

        "Wider tires trending (2.10-2.4\" / 53-61mm becoming common)",
