      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Entry requires annual USA Cycling membership (not one-day license), which adds cost for casual participants. But for the national championship jersey and UCI Worlds pathway, the value proposition is clear for serious racers."

      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "La Crescent is a 315-person town hosting 42 categories of national championship racers—the math doesn't add up for seamless operations. The venue bounces between Nebraska and Minnesota every two years, so local knowledge resets constantly. On the plus side, USA Cycling runs the show with actual organizational competence, and the Apple Festival timing gives you somewhere to eat afterward."

        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "131 miles separates pretenders from actual gravel racers—long enough to expose every weakness in your training plan. It's not the 200-mile death march that some events throw at you, but six hours of Driftless punishment will find your limits. The distance forces real strategy instead of hero moves, which is exactly what a national championship should demand."

      "technicality": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The Driftless Region's karst limestone creates sinkholes and surprise terrain changes that'll catch you off guard, but this isn't mountain bike territory. 10-15% grades with some 20% kickers demand real bike handling skills on loose gravel. The 'goat track' section near Hokah in 2025 had riders walking, but most of the course rewards power over pure technical wizardry."
      },
      "elevation": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "7,000 feet of climbing means sustained 400-500 foot climbs that locals call 'Driftless monsters'—enough to shatter legs but not redefine suffering. The Ice Age glaciers missed this area, leaving steep bluffs and ravines that create legitimate climbing challenges. It's significantly harder than the Nebraska pancake-flat original course, but won't rival mountain races."
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "September in Minnesota means 50-degree mornings that climb to 70s if you're lucky, or sideways rain that turns 'champagne gravel' into slick misery. The 2025 edition had muddy sections that caught riders off guard despite the usually smooth surface conditions. You'll start in arm warmers and finish in shorts, assuming the weather doesn't decide to punish everyone equally."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "La Crescent sits at Mississippi River valley elevation—basically sea level for anyone who's raced above 5,000 feet. The 'high plains' Nebraska venue was equally irrelevant from an altitude standpoint. Your sea-level lungs will work just fine here, so don't blame thin air when you crack."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Racing for Stars and Stripes on courses that change dramatically between Nebraska's Oregon Trail country and Minnesota's limestone bluffs keeps things interesting. The venue rotation means you can't just dial in the same strategy year after year. It's a national championship with real consequences and UCI Worlds qualification, but the relatively new event lacks the deep mythology of established classics."
