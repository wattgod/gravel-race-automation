          "description": "When you've watched this, Watch this - https://youtu.be/euBN2ODkFYw \nThen see if your comments are still valid!\n\nWhile these signs strongly advise pedestrians to stay off cycling trails for safety, the legal situation is more complex.\n\nThe Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 (CROW Act) gave the public a new legal right of access to \"open access land\" in England and Wales. This land primarily includes mountain, moor, heath, and downland, and much of the land managed by Forestry England falls under this category. This means that, by law, the public has a right to walk on this land.\n\nTherefore, while a sign with a crossed-out person is a critical safety warning and should be respected, it does not always represent a legal prohibition. It's a way for Forestry England to manage risk and guide people towards safer, more suitable walking routes.\n\nThis reality highlights a significant challenge for forest management: balancing public access rights with the need for user safety. \n\nI have my opinions on this and clearly not everyone agrees, which is absolutely fine as is your right to agree or disagree. I'm not changing my opinion on the response I got but clearly the signage is not as clear cut as it first appeared.\n\nLet me know your thoughts in the comments below....\n\n\nFollow me on Socials\n\n📷 Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/mark_page_music_and_video/\n📘 Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/red.bartape.productions/\n🚴‍♀️STRAVA: https://www.strava.com/athletes/10961024\n🎵 TIKTOK: https://www.tiktok.com/@markpagemtb\n\n 💰 If you would like to make a small contribution to support the channel then please hit the SUPER THANKS button 😊\n\n#calibre_bikes\n#MarkPageMTB\n#RedbartapeProductions\n#gopro\n#mtblife\n\nBikes:\nCalibre Triple B\nCalibre Two.

          "transcript": "[music]\nIn Blood Mountain, Georgia, a biker was\nriding with his friends and carving\nthrough every corner. But in one turn,\nhe made a few crucial mistakes.\nThe rider made several mistakes. He\nleaned too far. His riding line was off.\nAnd most importantly, he was going too\nfast because he entered the corner at\nthat speed. His line fell apart, and he\ntried to lean even lower to make it\nthrough. But at that point, it just\nwasn't possible.\nNo, for sure not.\n&gt;&gt; Luckily, the rider was okay and\ncontinued his ride afterward.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the cop gave me two tickets.\n&gt;&gt; A group of dirt bikers went out for a\nride. Some dirt bikes don't have turn\nsignals, and this clip shows the\ndangerous consequences of that.\nIn situations like this, always keep\nextra distance when riding behind a\ngroup ride. Since some dirt bikes don't\nhave turn signals, you have to read\ntheir body position, slow down early,\nand stay prepared for sudden turns.\nFortunately, the rider was fine and he\ndecided to take a slower, more careful\napproach in the future.\nIn Dallas, Texas, a writer shows why\nusing a night visor actually matters\nwhen you're riding at night.\nWOOHOO!\nWe found the keys right here. Slid all\nthat way, guys. 100 m.\n&gt;&gt; The answer is 328 places.\nIn Sydney's Motorsport Park, a rider,\nJay Jenkowski, [music]\nwas head towards his track day where he\nplanned a beautiful ride. At the track,\nhe was carving through the beautiful\ncorners of the circuit. But one turn\nended his fun for the day.\nThe rider hangs off too far without\nbringing his upper body with him, so he\nends up putting pressure on the bars. At\na little throttle that lightens the\nfront wheel, it hits a bump, the bars\ntwitch, and the front finally tucks. A\nclassic front end wash out.\n&gt;&gt; Such a bummer. Like I'm completely fine.\nIt happens.\n&gt;&gt; Luckily, the biker is perfectly fine. To\navoid this yourself, hang off just\nenough. Keep your chest low and use your\nlegs, not your arms to hold you up. Stay\nlight on the bars and roll on the\nthrottle smoothly so the front keeps its\ngrip. By the way, Jay has a really solid\nchannel for anyone interested in Moto Vo\nsetups. He shares great tips and tricks\non how to mount your cameras, capture\nclean footage, and get those perfect\nriding shots. So, make sure to check him\nout. On the streets of Turkey, a rider\nwas going way too fast. And when a small\ntruck moved into his path, he crashed.\n&gt;&gt; This is why you need to slow down,\nespecially when you're lane splitting or\nfiltering.\nSometimes just a small distraction is\nenough to make you crash.\nThe rider said he got target fixated,\nbut you're probably wondering on what.\nThere was a horse to his right. Target\nfixation can happen to anyone. Your eyes\nlock onto something and your bike\nfollows. Always keep your focus on where\nyou want to go, not on the distraction.\nYeah.\n&gt;&gt; In the beautiful city of Tlisi, Georgia,\ntwo bikers were riding through their\ngreen light when suddenly a family\nrisked their lives by walking straight\nthrough a red light.\nThe other rider wasn't able to stop in\ntime, but luckily no one was injured,\nthough this could have ended much worse.\nIn the US, an estimated 260,000 crashes\nevery year involve people running red\nlights. Even with a green light, always\nscan both sides. People running red\nlights can appear out of nowhere, and a\nquick check can prevent a serious crash.\nA rider from Riverhead, New York, was\nstanding still when an illegal group\nride passed by. Moments later, a cop\npulled up, mistaking him for one of\nthem, leaving the rider totally shocked.\n&gt;&gt; I'm not doing anything, man. I'm not\ndoing it. I'm street legal, man.\n&gt;&gt; I'm not doing anything. I'm street\nlegal.\n&gt;&gt; What everybody doing?\n&gt;&gt; I ride the trail, man. I am.\n&gt;&gt; I'm recording this, TOO.\n&gt;&gt; I'M NOT DOING I'm street legal. I got I\ngot one stop.\nEverything's up to date. I'm not on\nthat, man.\n&gt;&gt; What is all this?\nPull it over right now. PULL IT OVER.\n&gt;&gt; I'M NOT TRAIL. I don't ride with you,\nman.\n&gt;&gt; You got a plane?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm 100%.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, man. I don't do all that.\n&gt;&gt; Doesn't matter. You see everybody riding\nall over the place? What's the name of\nthis group?\n&gt;&gt; I don't know, man. I don't I'm not on\nthat dirt bag [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] man.\n&gt;&gt; Are you the fall guy that just stops so\nthat we talk to you?\n&gt;&gt; I don't do that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] man. I'm telling\nyou. You want my information? Every\n&gt;&gt; Everything's up to date.\n&gt;&gt; I'm not on that bull. Huh? And surely\n&gt;&gt; just go home. Don't be a part of this.\n&gt;&gt; No, man.\n&gt;&gt; Just go home.\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; Be smart.\n&gt;&gt; I don't I don't associate with these\nkids.\n&gt;&gt; I ride trails.\n&gt;&gt; The writer was at the wrong place at the\nwrong time. The police thought he was\ncomplicit in the group ride and treated\nhim like a fall guy, but he genuinely\nwasn't part of it. What would you have\ndone in this situation? Let me know in\nthe comments below.\nIn the mountains of Georgia, a rider was\ncruising along, but there was a lot of\ngravel on the road. And with gravel\ncomes a higher risk. Hard breaking can\nmake you crash much faster than on clean\npavement.\nThe writer went into the corner too\nfast, and when he saw the fence, he\npanicked. With all that loose gravel on\nthe ground, he slid out immediately. On\ngravel, panic braking is a recipe for a\ncrash. Always slow down before the\ncorner and use smooth inputs to stay in\ncontrol.\nWhen you go through a corner, even if\nit's not very sharp, you still need to\nlean with it. If you don't, you're going\nto miss the turn. And that's exactly\nwhat happened to this rider.\nIt looks like the rider made two\nmistakes. First, he didn't lean into the\ncorner and went in too straight. And\nsecond, he glanced to his left for a\nsplit second, losing focus and drifting\nstraight instead of following the turn.\nThe writer said he was completely fine\nthanks to his protective gear. So always\nwear your gear.\nIn Istanbul, Turkey, a biker was lane\nsplitting. And sure, lane splitting\ncomes with its risks. But what happened\nhere was absolutely not the rider's\nfault.\nI mean, who expects someone to just open\ntheir door on the highway? Even in\ntraffic, nobody does that. Luckily, the\nrider was fine. A car door opening on\nthe highway is completely unexpected and\nextremely dangerous. This is why drivers\nshould always check their mirrors before\nopening a door, no matter the situation.\nA rider from Asen in the Netherlands was\nout cruising when he realized he was\ngoing way too fast for an upcoming\ncorner. So he bailed to the grass path\non the side, but at the end of that path\nwas a massive pothole he didn't see\ncoming.\nLuckily, he was wearing proper\nmotorcycle boots, so nothing happened\nbesides a close call. But this isn't the\nonly incident in the Netherlands where a\nrider decides to cut through the grass\nnext to the main road.\n&gt;&gt; Oh god.\n&gt;&gt; Shortcuts like this look safe, but\nthey're full of hidden dangers,\npotholes, uneven ground, mud, or debris.\nLeaving the asphalt should always be a\nlast resort, not a plan.\nRiding in Deals Gab, North Carolina can\nbe incredibly satisfying, but if someone\nslides out, that satisfaction usually\ndisappears unless the slide happens to\nbe a beautiful one. And in this case, it\nwas a nice one.\nOh,\ngood slide though.\n&gt;&gt; The rider went too low in the corner and\nscraped the ground which caused him to\nlowside the bike. When you lean too far\nwithout the right speed, traction or\nbody position, the tires can lose grip\nand the bike will lowside. Always find\nyour limits gradually. Keep your body\nstable and avoid pushing beyond what the\ncorner allows.\n&gt;&gt; That was nice as hell how you slid that\nthough. That was bad as hell, Tom.\n[laughter]\nHe was like sl [screaming]\nlike he was coming into a performance.\n&gt;&gt; Zoo, he was running.\nThis writer from Turkey is the perfect\nexample of what I want Crash Bandito\nfans to be. Someone who sees danger\nbefore it even happens. Pay attention to\nthis bus.\nThe biker moved to the side of the\nintersection because he saw in his\nmirrors that the bus driver wasn't going\nto stop. The clip went viral this week\nin the country and even the tour\noperator responded to the incident.\nThere is an English saying by Jeep by\ntwice.\nThe writer bought a cheap knockoff of a\nquad lock. Now he doesn't just need a\nnew mount for his moped. He needs a new\nphone, too. Always invest in quality\ngear. You really do get what you pay\nfor.\nA writer from Japan showed another\nclassic example of why you shouldn't\ngive too much throttle in a turn. And he\nfound out the hard way.\nLuckily, the rider was completely fine,\nbut his bike took a long time to get\npulled out of that ditch.\nA rider from Bavaria was messing around\non his moped, but zigzagging on any\ntwo-wheeler is never a good idea.\nA rider from Massachusetts had a really\nclose call with a car that didn't see\nher.\nAnd this is exactly why you need to slow\ndown and always assume other drivers\ndon't see you. Give yourself enough time\nand space to react because sometimes\nyour awareness is the only thing that\nkeeps you safe. A group of riders in\nIndia were already unstable from heavy\nbraking but then something else happened\nthat really finished the situation off.\nThe rider had nothing serious, but he\ndefinitely needed a moment to chill. And\nof course, he was worried about his\nbike. What happened here is simple. He\nbraked hard, then hit a bump while the\nsuspension was already compressed. When\nthat happens, your tires can momentarily\nlose contact with the road. And with no\ngrip, the bike became uncontrollable.\nThat's why you should always try to\nbreak before the bumps, not on them, and\nease off a little if the road surface is\nrough.\n&gt;&gt; In the West Midlands, UK, Moad was\nriding down towards the Ring Road in\nWolverampton when this happened.\n&gt;&gt; Hi there, guys. Welcome back to Moto\nDad. How we all doing today? Are we\ngood?\nFlipping pret.\nWally idiot.\nAbsolute prat.\nUse your freaking eyes, you\nidiot. Sorry guys, I never swear. I do\napologize. It's your blood boiling.\n&gt;&gt; We've got clip from his mid turkey where\nthis rider shows exactly why you\nshouldn't ride on the shoulder.\nLuckily, the biker was fine and got\nright back up. But remember, a lot of\npeople suddenly use the shoulder legally\nor illegally, and they're not expecting\na rider to be there. That's what makes\nit so dangerous. Before we get into some\ngood vibes from New York, here's an\ninteraction from the Bronx between a\nmoped rider and a car driver.\n&gt;&gt; Are youing idiot?\n&gt;&gt; Are you stupid?\n&gt;&gt; You you local\nHuh? I was going to you.\nI love you.\nCome here. I love you.\nI love you. [laughter]\n&gt;&gt; [laughter]\n&gt;&gt; Yo, I catch that lacking. I catch that\nlacking. Wait here. I catch him lacking.\nI catch him lacking.\n&gt;&gt; Can my Spanish- speakaking viewers let\nme know in the comments what they were\nsaying? And if it's something bad, just\ngive me a quick summary. A rider from\nNew York was filling up his gas when\nsomeone in need approached him, asking\nfor something that might seem simple to\nmost of us, but not for everyone.\n&gt;&gt; I got you.\n&gt;&gt; Give me one second.\nYou know how low you are?\nYeah, a little bit. This is how you read\nan oil dipstick. You'll see two holes or\nlines, one marking the minimum oil level\nand the other marking the maximum. If\nthe oil is below that minimum mark, it's\ntime to refill.\nI got you. Thank you. No problem. In the\ncar real quick.\nEvery car is different, but for many\nmodern vehicles, one of the most common\noils is 5W30.\nThat should do it.\n&gt;&gt; And buy you a drink or something.\n&gt;&gt; No, it's okay. I don't want your money.\n&gt;&gt; No, it's okay. I'm just here to help\nout, you know. Thank you so much.\n&gt;&gt; No problem. I hope I can help out a\nlittle bit. You know,\n&gt;&gt; you really did. Thank you.\n&gt;&gt; Enjoy the rest of your day.\n&gt;&gt; 2 minutes of kindness cost you nothing,\nbut it can mean the world to an elderly\nperson.

          "transcript": "[Music]\nMountain bike fans, welcome to the 2025\nMarathon XC World Championship. Yes, I\nam a Daniel reporter. However, we got a\ncall last minute last night informing us\nthat there was a spot left on the\nchopper that was going to go and cover\nthe XC marathon race today. Obviously, I\nam no discipline expert. However, I am\ngoing to try to show you how insane this\ndiscipline is, how beautiful the places\nthey're going is, and hopefully it will\nmake you want to watch a little bit more\nof XC Marathon in the future. So, jump\nwith me in the chopper and discover this\n125k course through the Swiss Alps.\nUnlike Daniel Racers, And athletes like\nto start early when it's still cold, so\nthey set off at 6:00 a.m. to brave the\nbrisk morning of Verbier.\nA little early for my taste. However,\nother disciplines rarely get full\nchloric life band on course. So, there's\nthat.\nThe women were starting 5 minutes after\nthe men. But by the 15k mark, the top 10\ngroup had already caught up with the\nback of the male pack. But wait, what\nexactly is XC marathon? And how is this\nVerdia course so different from a\ntraditional track?\n&gt;&gt; Marathon is meaning it's just long\ndistance. So it's not just 42 something\nkilometers. Uh it's just really long. Uh\nhere it's 125ks and 5,000 m of climbing.\nWhat's special here? It's a A2B race. Uh\nnormally the marathon would do a big\nloop and and here it's crossing many\nvalleys uh from Via to Breeze.\nAfter almost crash landing because the\nsun was facing the wrong direction,\nblinding out our pilot, we got to\nwitness some rather interesting piloting\nstrategies such as the OPPO balance\ncornering technique, the sit on the\nsaddle downhill strategy, or some great\nclassic like the god, I'm not making\nthis one, or the timeless block pass\nwell known from motocross afficionados.\nInterestingly, the course also included\na set of slippery metal stairs, which I\nthought was a bold choice considering\nthe cost of Afghan Switzerland for a\nforeigner, but some interesting shapes\nwere thrown on that bit of ashalt.\nSo, we have arrived at the third spot\nafter a short hilly ride, and it's a bit\nweird, but there is like an immature\nrace going on. So, it's like a bunch of\nmiddle-aged men just kind of like\npushing their bike through the rocks.\nUm, I'm not really sure when the pros\nare supposed to storm through, but that\nseems like it might be a bit of an\nissue. The pros eventually did storm\nthrough, and it was indeed a little bit\nof an issue with a lot of shouting and\nscrambling onto rocks. But to the random\npunters defense, the elites did also\nstruggle in those tight and technical\nrock sections with a fair amount of them\ndeciding to dismount and run instead.\nHeat. Heat.\nThen it was time for the lead woman to\nstorm through. And what a show. A pure\ndisplay of power and skills with Kate\nCourtney clearing a rock garden 98% of\nthe field. Men and women wouldn't ride\nthrough without putting a foot down.\nAnna Winebeer wasn't so lucky and ended\nup making a small mistake which would\nsee her put the knee to the ground. At\nthis stage, she looked pretty beat up\nand I didn't know if she was going to\nhold on to Kate till the end.\nSo, we're at kilometer 80 and they're\ngoing right there.\nSee that? They're going here.\nThat is very unintent.\nSo, I'm on the third and last pick. And\nI think the course creator may be a\nlittle sadistic because that pinch\nclimb, I mean, I don't even know if you\ncan call it a pinch climb. That climb is\nvertical. Like, you wouldn't catch me\ndead on an ebike trying to go up that.\nSo, as you can see, this is the end. But\nwait,\nthey're coming all the way from there.\nLike, I can't even see the bottom. It\nreally doesn't do it justice, but it is\nvertical. I'm going to try to go and\nmeasure how steep it actually is.\n&gt;&gt; 24°. That's insane.\n&gt;&gt; See this sign? It means why are you\ndoing this in French? And I have the\nsame question.\n&gt;&gt; This is definitely an incredibly tough\ncourse. I don't think the marathon\nworlds have had just quite such a tough\ncourse. Um, it is very special. The\ncourse record was just below 6 hours.\nMost marathon world championship have\nbeen around 5 hours for the main maximum\nplus the altitude. We're here at 2,800\nm. So that makes it really tough.\n[Applause]\nUnfortunately, because the finish was\nonly 15k away and the average pace for\nthe top guys was 20.7k an hour, we had\nto rush out As soon as the top five went\nby, Keegan Swenson would cross the line\nafter red lining for 6 hours, 1 minute,\nand 44 seconds. He didn't end up beating\nthe course record because of the tough\nwet conditions in some sections, but\nbattled through the whole race to take\nthe lead between kilome 80 and 100.\nObby, thanks for the support. You know,\nI know uh a lot of friends and family\nare watching back home and uh know\neveryone else. So, uh, yeah, really\nexcited.\n&gt;&gt; So, it does seem like hard tails are\nback in a big way. Crazy to see that\nafter all this technological\nadvancement, you can still win an XC\nWorld Championship on one of those.\nGate Courtney would cross the line about\nan hour and 10 minutes behind, and she\nsurely was the most excited athlete on\nthe planet that day.\nThis course is crazy. Um, I I'm honestly\ncan't put it into words yet, but really\nreally proud of this one and just really\ngrateful that I was able to get it over\nthe line on a clean ride today. It's a\nsuper hard course. Uh, yeah, 125k, 5,000\nm of climbing is insane. Um, I thought\nLebl was hard and this like took the\nante up a notch. But it's challenges\nlike these that I think like push us to\nthe edge and provide a menu to like get\nthe best out of yourself. And I'm really\nproud I was able to do that today. To be\nat the end of a 4,000 ft climb, hiking,\ncarrying the bike is is just such mental\ntorture. Honestly, I was calling it the\nportage of positivity. My mental coach\nand I worked on the hiking section a\nlittle bit. Um, and it was even harder\nthan I imagined it would be. Yeah. I I\nfeel like that's where I really just had\nto like get gritty and make it up that\nthe like scariest or hardest part of the\ncourse was that last descent. I had like\na tiny sidewall cut just probably bad\nluck hit a rock somewhere. Um and I rode\na flat tire basically from the top of\nthat to the to the finish line which is\nthe most technical descent of the\ncourse. So it really reminded me that\nlike you know things are earned but\nthey're also given and I'm grateful that\nuh it worked out in the end.",

          "transcript": "howdy folks i'm jp\nand i'm here to talk about my bike and\nthe kit i used for the 2021\ngreat divide classic just finished up i\nguess 10 days ago\nso everything's pretty fresh uh that's\nnew mexico dirt that you see down there\nand i didn't want to brush that off so\ni'm just kind of keeping it real for\ny'all\nthis is a rodeo labs and it's the\nflanimal\n5.0 it's a steel bike and then it's just\ngot a couple of unique features\nactually has a sliding dropouts and this\nis actually a carbon\nuh seat tube and then there's a little\ncutout here\njust to give it a little personality a\nlittle carbon here with the head badge\non it and then it is the also\nthe rodeo labs spork uh love using the\nbike\nuh i'm not gonna give it a category uh\npeople wanna call it a gravel bike\nbut look at that the kid shoved 29\n2.1 tires in so i'm not sure\nbut yeah everything worked great let's\nsee here i ran a\nshimano drivetrain this is grx\nso no fiddling around smashing mountain\nbike and road components together\nclean build worked flawlessly electronic\ntried and true xtr pedals this is\nactually a\n30 46. so yeah\nif you're familiar with grx you might\nthink it's a 3148\nit's not they do make true subcompact\nchain rings which is what this\nis and i might have broken the rules uh\nthis is an 11\n42 cassette which i didn't realize it\nwould actually work but it did\nand i don't know if shimano says you\ncould do that or not so everything's\njust full grx\num and then if we come up top we'll just\nkind of show some controls\nwhich uh i think is awesome this is\nsomething that uh i envisioned and then\nmade it happen\nyou know traditional dual control levers\nhere shifting braking\nbut then on top we mounted some uh call\nthese little\nshifter buttons uh our climbers buttons\nso this is shifters\neach side and then we also have what we\ncall sub brakes\nso this was really awesome just to be\nhere to be able to\ni use this stuff a lot i actually even\ngot a little callus on my thumb from\nhitting the shifter button so much\nand then there again in the aero bars\ni've been doing this for a little while\nnow but the controls on the ends\ncan't say enough everything worked great\nuh i carried an extra battery we'll see\nthat in another video\num okay so let's move on\nwheels another important piece super\nstoked\nsome i9 wheels and uh these are the\nul 25s so 25 internal\ncarbon pretty lightweight wheel set\npretty stoked uh\nthrew a little color in there blue and\nsilver and then\nyou can see i ran some mezcal tires\ntubeless never had a problem\nused uh pan racer uh seal smart sealant\nnever topped it off\nand there again just like really stoked\non the mezcals and uh they\nwere really impressive that's the first\ntime i've ever rode them um you can see\nthere's still a little bit of\nsomething to them no flats never even\nnever even changed my pressure\nso i i would say that would be a\nmaintenance free trip other than a\nlittle bit of lube\nfront wheel it is also a carbon rim\nindustry nine built on a sun hub i\nactually changed that like\nthree days before i left i didn't think\ni was gonna run dynamo but i did\ni'm glad i did speaking of dynamo we got\nthat\nmated up with the k light i don't know\nwhich edition that is\ni honestly have a lot of them carrie's\nbeen great to me i've tested some of the\nstuff but uh\nsuper bright love it you can see on the\nfront end of the bike since we're here\nthis is a custom bag brian made this\nfrom fbj customs\nuh several years old i got hand issues\nstill numb\nbut i got to keep them warm so this is\nactually all my gloves there again we'll\nsee that again we'll move down over to\nhere you can see this is what we call\nthe fred bar i'm going to call it a j\nbar though\nthen it has head flip up\narrow bars pretty sweet it's hard for me\nto use anything else at this point\nthis is super key for me out of the way\nit's those kind of details that make the\nbig differences risers\nget a little more height out of it boom\nfred bart does some height and bringing\nit back but that even more adjustment\num you can see i have a little switch\nhere this is to go between\nmy light and my usb charging i never use\ndual use it's either\none thing or the other i want full power\nto whatever mode\ni'm not going to split that uh and i\nnever do uh use a pass-through uh\nbattery bank either\nthis is a garmin 830 this is a permanent\nwire here\nand i would just charge this throughout\nthe day but i don't like to switch wires\nlike if i need to go inside and use a\nwire\nlike to charge something if i'm eating\nsomething or at a hotel or something\nlike\ni don't want to unroute this i have a\ndifferent set for that\npretty funny i never used my etrax i\nnever even brought it\nalan you were there at the start and i\nwas like do i bring this nah\nthe other piece is what's holding the\ngarment on kh\n[Music]\nwhile we're also up here you can see um\nsome pretty big\ngrips right here this is actually an\nenvy bar\nit comes in 48 millimeters or 48\ncentimeters a pretty big bar\nwrapped i guess two times and then down\nhere\ni threw the redshift you can see the\nredshift\nlittle grips and i left them loose on\npurpose just so i could turn it within\nmy hand\nhonestly if i was to use them again i'd\nprobably grind all this off because\nit's pretty rough on the hand that's\nkind of feedback i have for them\nright down here is uh the stem and\nthat's a redshift stem and\nuh that's shock stop just a little bit\nthere again take a little bit of the\nedge off\ni mean actually you see the bars have a\nlot of flex and that's meant to have\nbut then the stem is also going to add\nto it so\nget a little more comfort on the front\nend without having to go to full\nsuspension in our front suspension\nand i've been using it for years so yeah\ni like it controlling the front end of\nthe bike\nis the uh this here we have a headset in\nhere and that's a visco set it's almost\nlike a steering dampener if you will you\ncan see\nit just doesn't flop even with weight on\nit somebody asked me if i noticed it was\nthere\ni didn't notice it was there so that's\nprobably a good thing\nif we took it off i'd probably notice\nthen it was gone okay moving on\nalong here um so some exile bags uh\npretty cool patterns for sure um and uh\nit's actually a collab with rodeo rodeo\nhelped uh kind of\nlay this out some topo stuff so their\nmaterial\nlooks good on the bike um nothing\nspecial i'm not too fancy like that but\ni like it\nand then two bottles you can see this is\nactually a liter bottle if you're\nfamiliar or not with these it's hard to\nfind a big bottle a lot of bottles are\n24 ounces\nthis is actually a full liter so 32.\njust getting more capacity that way that\nworked out well\nand then down here a little stiff\nso this is actually a wide foot cage uh\nwith also one of the rivoli straps a\nbranded valet strap\ni only had to take this off once the\nwhole time so that's a good thing\nbecause that's all my tools and repair\nstuff\nso this is a a zephyl cargo bottle\nand the top of it unscrews so you can\nactually even make it shorter\nthis is an add-on piece some titanium\nking cages\nwhatever cool bling not cheap here we\nhave\na pro pro discover seat post\num a little bit of flex out of that\npretty nice carbon\ncarbon rail physique arione it's on\nevery seat uh every bike i have great\nsaddle for me i like a long saddle\nespecially with arrow bars get up\nforward\nfor an ft let's see let's move on to\nthis piece here and this is a tail fin\nrack bag combo this was a prototype this\nis something that\ntailfin and nick and i uh collaborated\non\nand i fed him a bunch of ideas he kind\nof liked what i'm telling him and then\nwe kind of went ahead and did some stuff\nhere i won't go into too many details\nabout it\ni'll tell you right now that this is not\nheavier than a seat bag\nyou can see how stable it is it's easy\nfor me to lift my leg over\nit's not moving it's not additional\nweight on my saddle\ni just love it you can see there's tons\nof\nquick access accessories uh or outside\npockets so easy\nvery functional very easy to get at\nthings\num from both ends so i don't got to\nunload to get at certain things\nit's it's kind of cool i'm pretty stoked\nwith it we'll probably make a few more\nchanges but\num it's close and it should be an item\nthat i would love to see be\nuh people be able to purchase small\nlittle tail light\num back here oh yeah and then we were\ntalking about the brakes\nsome grx brakes and with some fancy\nxtr 160 rotors because they look cool\nbrake pads uh i carried actually two\nsets so\nfour sets or two total sets i never\nneeded to use them which is kind of\ncrazy 2500 miles i just kind of just\npeeked at the\nthe rear pads there's actually a little\nlife left in the rear i might have heard\nthe front's going a little bit but\nthat's okay uh so pretty stoked they\ndidn't have to use us here's another\nsafety piece for me\nuh this is cool this is like one of\nthose slot bracelets almost it's kind of\nmeaningful\ni got it from uh from italy from italy\ndivide\nand i have a lot of great friends over\nthere and i just love to be able to take\nit on and off and\njust a reflective piece of kit i think\nthat's everything that we\nvisually see yeah we'll go ahead and\ndive into what's in the bags\nuh in kind of our our next clip next\nvideo but um\nthat's the bike i used for the 2021\ngrape divide classic i have no idea what\nit weighs\nhonestly i don't care what it weighs but\nyeah if you have any questions go ahead\nand drop them below and we'll see if we\ncan get to them\nall right thanks thanks so much for\nsqueezing dirty teeth into your busy\nschedule\nplease help us reach more people and\nensure you receive new videos by
