The event provides a start village with staff welcome, event packs, and finisher facilities including showers and meals, but basic logistical details stay frustratingly inconsistent."

Stefano Rodighiero completed the Short Beach 400km over four days with daily stages of 132km, 111km, 101km, and 53km. The multi-day format allows riders to \"split your route into four days and take up the entire allocated time\" with Friday-to-Tuesday flexibility. Similar distance to Crusher in the Tushar."

The route includes intentional walking sections where \"there even are some sections that are meant to be walked, pushing the bike\" for phenomenal sightseeing. Surface conditions center on \"mostly unpaved\" canal roads alongside rivers and waterways throughout the Veneto plain. Less technical than The Mid South."

      "elevation": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The Short Beach packs 2,800m elevation into 400km while the Short Lake reduces climbing to 1,800m over the same distance. Notable climbs include Passo San Boldo and routes \"up to the foot of the Dolomites.\" The Newbie route delivers the steepest profile at 2,800m elevation over just 200km, making for significantly more vertical per kilometer than the longer options. Similar elevation profile to Gravel Worlds."

        "explanation": "Historical weather data shows average highs of 54°F and lows of 40°F, with a 32% chance of rain on any given day. Recent editions show variable April conditions. One 2024 rider experienced \"sun, rain, wind, more wind, thunderstorms but also a lot of laughter.\" Stefano Rodighiero noted in 2025 that \"the weather in the first two day was not the best\" with his pace dropping notably on day three, likely weather-related. Another 2025 participant saw \"thick, dark clouds looming over the mountains\" but \"almost no rain.\" Similar climate challenges to SBT GRVL."

      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Routes stay in the Veneto lowlands and foothills with no significant altitude challenges. The terrain spans \"rivers, countryside, rural landscapes, natural and coastal environments, up to the foot of the Dolomites\" but doesn't climb into alpine elevations. Starting near sea level around the Venetian plain, the event requires zero altitude acclimatization. Lower altitude than Gravel Worlds — no thin-air concerns."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The route \"opens up a hidden side of Italy, full of little-known tracks and long-forgotten corners\" through diverse terrain that \"changes face with every kilometer.\" Riders navigate the Lapisina Valley on paths different from obvious routes, plus the distinctive \"Cento giorni\" Piave section. The flexible format means \"some sleep under the stars in a sleeping bag, some stop for a hot meal in a Venetian tavern.\""

      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The non-competitive format eliminates traditional race infrastructure like timing chips or results. Riders collect stamps at checkpoints for brevet completion rather than racing against the clock. As one participant noted, \"there's not even a result's list\" and \"no big clock timing you as you cross the finish line.\" The focus stays purely on completing the adventure rather than performance metrics."

The atmosphere emphasizes \"no pressure or competition\" with organizers Roberto Polato and Velia Agostini who \"travel the tracks kilometer by kilometer.\" Video reports capture \"a lot of laughter\" even during challenging weather, reflecting the supportive non-competitive culture."

Participants range from first-time bikepackers (\"my first time riding a loaded bike by night\") to experienced riders completing 700km classics in 54 hours. Without timing or results, there's no way to measure competitive depth — everyone's just \"completing the route\" at their chosen pace and style. Less competitive depth than Almanzo 100."

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Registration includes welcome village facilities, event pack, checkpoints with stamps, finisher celebration with showers and meals. The multi-route format (200-700km options) provides flexibility for different budgets and time commitments. With 1,300+ participants creating economies of scale for what's become \"the biggest gravel bikepacking event in Europe,\" the infrastructure appears well-developed for the participation fee."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Registration runs €60-100. Northern Italy near Venice and Lake Garda carries tourist-level pricing for accommodation. Claudia Gerosa managed costs by pre-booking hotels for her 2.5-day approach, while others \"sleep under the stars\" or find \"somewhere comfy to sleep\" in historic villages. The event allows \"any bike: MTB, road bike, fat bike, plus, e-bike\" reducing equipment requirements, though organizers recommend gravel bikes as ideal. Higher total cost than Badlands."

          "description": "Asolo Gravel Tour\n\nGiro in bici gravel fino nel centro storico di Asolo. Partenza da Montecchio Maggiore. Il percorso passa per Quinto Vicentino, Lanzè, sull’Itinerario Ciclopedonale del Brenta e sul Sentiero degli Ezzelini. Questa gravellata è quasi tutta pianeggiante (salvo la salita ad Asolo) e si pedala tra le provincie di Vicenza e Treviso, in Veneto. Si pedala su parte della Ciclovia Fiume Brenta e su parte del Sentiero degli Ezzelini. Da Asolo si raggiunge Bassano del Grappa passando sul Ponte degli Alpini. Si percorrono poi tanti argini e strade sterrate alternati a strade asfaltate transitando per Marostica e Breganze. Infine Itinerario delle Risorgive del Bacchiglione e ritorno a Montecchio Maggiore su strade secondarie. Più del 50% del giro è su piste ciclabili/percorsi gravel, in parte asfaltati e in parte sterrati. Percorso ideale per chi vuole fare cicloturismo in Veneto.\n\nAsolo Gravel Tour è la quarta di una serie di gravellate che abbiamo tracciato e che vi raccontiamo qui su YouTube. Qui sul nostro canale trovate una playlist che chiamiamo Winter Gravel Tours dove raggruppiamo tutti questi itinerari adatti ad essere percorsi in gravel bike in inverno. Gli ingredienti per considerarsi Winter Gravel Tour sono: 100km circa belli scorrevoli, salite brevi, più ghiaia e sole possibile. La partenza sarà sempre da Vicenza e ci si dirigerà un pò verso tutti i punti cardinali.\n\nQuesto percorso cicloturistico di 145km e 600 metri di dislivello è indicato a tutti. Ideale da percorrere nella stagione invernale. La bicicletta adatta è una gravel bike in quanto sono presenti dei percorsi ciclabili sterrati. Ecco la traccia: https://www.komoot.it/tour/666635502 \n\nAbbiamo percorso questa gravellata con le nostre bici gravel 3T Exploro Race con single speed Shimano GRX 40T e 11-42, pneumatici Specialized Pathfinder tubeless da 38mm, borraccia Jet Elite Cycling da 550ml, portaoggetti Takuin Elite Cycling e borse da bikepacking di Miss Grape.\n\n0:00 Vicenza\n1:26 Itinerario del Brenta\n4:43 Sentiero degli Ezzelini\n6:39 Asolo\n8:41 Bassano del Grappa\n11:14 Risorgive del Bacchiglione\n\nPuoi acquistare il nostro Kit Gravellata by Miss Grape qui: https://missgrape.net/limited-edition/kit-gravellata-by-miss-grape/\n\nATTREZZATURA: \n- 3T Bike Exploro Race GRX 1X\n- Kit Gravellata by Miss Grape\n- maglia Supergiara Gravellata by Sportful\n- bib Sportful Supergiara Bibshort\n- calzini Sportful Matchy Socks\n- completo invernale Castelli Cycling\n- scarpe Fizik Terra Powerstrap X4\n- casco Met Helmets Allroad\n- sella Fizik Terra Argo X3\n- nastro manubrio Fizik Terra Bondcush 3mm tacky\n- borraccia Elite Cycling Jet 550ml\n- portaborraccia Elite Cycling Prism\n- porta oggetti Elite Cycling Takuin 550\n- tenda Ferrino Tent Set\n- saccoletto Ferrino Lightec SM 850\n- materassino Ferrino Air-Lite\n- luce anteriore Ravemen PR 1600 \n- luce anteriore Ravemen LR 500 S\n- luce posteriore Ravemen TR 50\n- cover smartphone e bag Eevye\n- fornello Jetboil Zip\n- cartuccia gas Decathlon\n- piumino comprimibile Forclaz Decathlon \n\nATTREZZATURA FOTO E VIDEO\n- iPhone 13 PRO\n- GoPro Hero 9 Black\n- Drone DJI Mini 2\n- Sony RX 100 Mark III\n\nSegui le nostre gravellate su: \n- INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/gravellata.cc/\n- SITO WEB: https://gravellata.cc/\n- FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/gravellata.cc\n- KOMOOT: https://www.komoot.it/user/1542604803444\n- YOUTUBE @3tcycling: https://bit.ly/3xWf6uE\n- BLOG 3T Bike: https://bit.ly/3x40DwX \n\nRegistriamo le gravellate con Garmin Edge 830.\n\nMontiamo i video con Adobe Premiere Pro.\n\nMusica: Epidemic Sound \n\nScrivici a: gravellata@gmail.com\n\n#asolo #gravelbike #ciclismo",
