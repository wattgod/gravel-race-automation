August in Vermont can be anything from perfect to swampy hell, and the research shows no historical weather data to plan around. New England summer humidity combined with 7000 feet of climbing is a recipe for heat casualties. No mention of weather incidents probably means they've been lucky, not immune. More weather exposure than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

Lower altitude than Gravel Worlds — no thin-air concerns."
