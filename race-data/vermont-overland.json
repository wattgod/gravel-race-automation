August in Vermont can be anything from perfect to swampy hell, and the research shows no historical weather data to plan around. New England summer humidity combined with 7000 feet of climbing is a recipe for heat casualties. No mention of weather incidents probably means they've been lucky, not immune. More weather exposure than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

Lower altitude than Gravel Worlds — no thin-air concerns."

          "transcript": "hi folks Peter vollers here from Vermont\nOverland I just wanted AI thought it\nwould be helpful if we showed one of the\nreally cool aspects of Vermont overland\nGrand Prix which is our Woodstock\nvillage downtown start and finish so I'm\ngoing to grab the camera and we come\nback and show you some of the stuff we\nhave on this big whiteboard here this\nbig blown up version of the village\nhighway map so just you know what to\nexpect you'll be coming into town most\npeople will be coming in by root for\ncoming from coming from the east are\ngoing to come in you're going to park on\nthese village streets and stuff we do\nhave some designated parking as you come\nin but generally just find a place as\nclose as you can to the course on the\nthis you know the village is yours for\nthe day we will have other people coming\nand visiting but just find a place to\npark on any of these streets right here\nthen what you're going to do is\nhopefully and actually if you're staying\nhere even better because you can just\nride right to the course which is really\ncool it don't even have to get in your\ncar so central street is gonna be closed\nfor the day which is pretty\ngroundbreaking here in the village and\nthe start-finish is going to be right at\nthe base of high street and central\nwhich is right there what we're going to\ndo in the morning nine o'clock go Oh\nfaster riders should line up in the\nfront you know mid range in the middle\nslower riders who are just doing it for\nthe adventure and the challenge in the\nback and there's Elm streets going to be\nclosed just for about 10 minutes for\nthat start go out by the Rockefeller\nmansions right here and you go out\nthrough beautiful buildings farming\nyou're off and running on the epic 53\nmile 92% dirt 77 sections of class four\nroad and which is these ancient\nunmaintained roads in Vermont which is\njust the most unique thing about the\nrace um just incredible but but here's\nthe deal if you do this race for no\nother reason do it for the finish the\nfinish is incredible I subject be back\nhere because um I need to show you\nthat's all this blue stuff the finish\nyou're going to come sweeping into the\nvillage and if you\non youtube I have a video with Brennan\nrim or he is doing most of this\nfinishing circuit on just an awesome\nvideo and it shows you how epic it is\nyou come back into town and you come\nright in front of Woodstock and you go\naround our little green here you enter\ninto the closed area on central street\nyou're going to make an abrupt right\nturn onto mechanic street which is this\ntiny little alleyway brick walls\nincredibly European incredibly cool this\nis where it starts to the cyclocross\nguys come into the realms it's going to\nbe super tight very abrupt and if you're\nwith anybody you're going to want to\nstart jockeying for position because\nyou're going to go around the comfort\nstation which is our public restrooms on\nthis little parking lot in this back\nalley then you're going to come into\nyou're going to go come into this\nfootbridge section the footbridge is\nthis wide so it's almost like a whole\nshot you're going to you're going to be\nvying for that whole shot and I'll tell\nyou why in a second because once you get\nacross the footbridge you're going to\npop up on the high street and then\nyou're going to immediately be setting\nup for the final section of Vermont pave\nDoubleday hill\nholy hill is this incredible hell in\nfact I'm looking out the window at it\nright now that is eighteen percent grade\nmaybe twenty percent grade in another\npart it's got a little bit of payment in\nthe beginning but then the rest of his\ngrass and dirt it's kind of some roughs\nand stuff it is just the coolest thing\nbut it is all there the nice thing about\nthat is that whether you're there vying\nfor the win or you're coming in three\nhours down there's going to be throngs\nof people cheering you on and doubled a\nhill because it's literally 200 feet\naway from the start finish so people can\ngo back and forth right through the\nvendor area then you pop up over the\nhill and you're going to be on slate and\nterrorists but the cool thing about it\nis even if you get gap thanh double date\nhill you're going to still have time on\nslate and terrorist if you've got just\nabout a little less than a kilometre to\nthe finish you're going to be able to\nget by anybody or catching buddy who may\nhave gap you on double the hill you can\ncertainly get over the top of somebody\non Lincoln Street and then you're going\nto come slamming down the once you're\ndown on the central street you only have\nabout 100 meters to the line maybe a\nlittle bit more maybe 110 hundred twenty\nbut then it's just you can come sweeping\nout of that turn and it's just a sprint\nfor the line at that point we're going\nto have Adam Adam sites of international\ncycling is doing his full whammy\nfinishing tape for the sponsors the\nsponsors will be on both sides on the\nfinishing fence we're going to have\nsponsors on the finishing boom it's\ngoing to be extremely European you guys\nare going to feel like you're in a\nEuropean Spring Classic it's going to be\namazing so please get in on this because\nit's just going to be a huge deal for\nmonoplane Grand Prix Peter

          "description": "Early in 2020, we registered for the Race to the Top of Vermont. It's Vermont's most famous hill climb, which ascends to the summit of Mount Mansfield, the Green Mountain State's highest peak. Alas, 2020 had other plans. Luckily, the folks behind the race, which benefits the Catamount Trail Association, came up with a clever and exciting alternative. Participants would ride on their own and log elevation gain.  They would have 36 hours to log as much gain as they can.  The most gain wins. \n\nChallenge accepted.\n\nThis is a ride which tested every aspect of our abilities, both mentally and physically.  It took us to the brink of our limits and tested the resilience of our friendship. We covered terrain that was challenging, bizarre, epic and simply a bad idea. And we loved every minute of it.\n\nThe only way to do this, for us, was to do it on gravel as much as possible, and to go places we'd never been. Vermont's \"gaps,\" or mountain passes, were the obvious targets, but we'd have to hit the less popular ones, the ones that weren't as easy as hopping on a carbon-fiber climbing bike, putting your head down and pushing watts. That meant our targets were Waitsfield Gap, Moretown Gap, Roxbury Gap and Braintree Gap.  Waitsfield and Braintree in particular were \"roads\" only by the broadest definition of the term. Crossing them would present more challenges than any regular asphalt road could even think to conjure. \n\nAnd then there were the unexpected challenges, which we never saw coming. The Class IV roads (a Vermont term -- perhaps you know them more as \"jeep trails\" at best) which devolved into untamed forest. River crossings. Feral pigs. Road closures. The Northfield Pigman. Too much to fit in a video of any reasonable length.\n\nWe came out the other side. In what condition and with what success, you'll need to watch these 12 minutes to find out.  We appreciate you taking the time to share the experience with us.  We hope you'll stick around for more such adventures.  There are always more on the way.\n\n-- Steve & Phil\n\nSupport the Catamount Trail Association: http://www.catamounttrail.org\n\nRace website: http://www.rtttovt.com\n\nOur website: https://www.greenmountaingravel.com\nOur other website: https://www.graveldads.com\n\nAdditional photography and support provided by Jim & Billie Maas.
