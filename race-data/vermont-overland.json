Registration opens January 1st at 9 AM through Movemint and sells out in hours with a 1000-rider cap. Critical details like packet pickup and parking remain undisclosed, though the race benefits local Reading/West Windsor organizations."

Sarah Skelly hit \"a series of five identical 0.3 mile climbs at >10% grades\" around mile 40, showing the course packs punishment into limited mileage."

        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "Eight sectors of Class 4 roads create what JOM calls \"Vermont pavé\" best described as \"rocky forest trail\" with sections that become \"logjams\" as riders dismount on steep, rocky grades.

      "elevation": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "7000 feet over 55 miles is 127 feet of climbing per mile—that's legitimately punishing. The rolling Green Mountain terrain creates a 'barrage of short, punchy climbs' that never lets up. This isn't one big mountain—it's death by a thousand cuts."
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "August in Vermont can be anything from perfect to swampy hell, and the research shows no historical weather data to plan around. New England summer humidity combined with 7000 feet of climbing is a recipe for heat casualties. No mention of weather incidents probably means they've been lucky, not immune."

      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Vermont Green Mountains keep altitude moderate—one race report mentions 5,700 feet total elevation gain over the course rather than high starting altitude. Riders like JOM note the 36-tooth cassette \"was used all day\" for steep grades, but altitude itself isn't the limiting factor in this terrain."

        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Elite riders like Ian Boswell and Tim Johnson participate, with Johnson leading pre-race recon rides covering technical \"baby head\" trails. The race attracts 300-400 riders in massive corrals and sells out a 1000-rider field in hours. However, the tragic 2022 death of professional Kenyan cyclist Sule Kangangi casts a shadow over the event's reputation."

        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Course design delivers with eight Class 4 sectors and bottlenecks that create tactical racing—Sarah Skelly gained ground by taking \"muddy rocks fewer people dared to ride\" while others took \"easy cuts on double track.\" Two Untapped Maple aid stations provide strategic support, with JOM highlighting \"Wood's Bourbon Barrel Maple Syrup\" shots at the Barnard Village station."
      },

        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "Equipment ranges from \"high-volume tire road bikes to true fat bikes\" according to course observers. The route starts at Suicide Six and features terrain so demanding that JOM \"bailed halfway through the steepest of the descents (something like 45 degrees)\" before the finish. Tim Johnson's pre-race clinics cover \"steep, technical 'baby head' trails\" and \"fast descents.\""

      "community": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "Benefits three local organizations including the Reading/West Windsor Food Shelf and reserves spots for locals and women. Selling out a 1000-rider field in hours for over a decade means the community connection is real, not manufactured. When Vermont gravel nerds keep coming back year after year, the culture is doing something right."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "No mention of pro riders, winner lists, or competitive depth in any race coverage. The 1000-rider cap creates scarcity but doesn't guarantee speed—this attracts adventure seekers more than racing thoroughbreds. Regional New England strength probably shows up, but you're not getting Unbound-level horsepower."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Registration costs aren't disclosed, which usually means they're not bragging about affordability. Two aid stations for 55 miles and 7000 feet seems light on support for what you're paying. The unique Class 4 road experience has value, but Vermont isn't cheap and this race knows it has demand."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Woodstock/West Windsor location means Vermont tourist pricing for lodging. JOM's equipment setup shows riders need proper gearing—\"a SRAM 1170 11-speed 11-36 unit\" with the 36-tooth cog \"used all day.\" Race organizers recommend minimum 32c tires and low gearing, while some riders opt for hardtail mountain bikes for the demanding Class 4 terrain."

      "should_you_race": "Those eight Class 4 sectors will humble anyone who shows up thinking this is a leaf-peeping tour. You need solid climbing legs for 7000 feet of punishment and bike handling skills for unmaintained roads that range from sketchy to bike-breaking. The 1000-rider field sells out in hours because riders who've done it know something the rest of us don't.",
      "alternatives": "Vermont 50 offers similar Green Mountain suffering with more singletrack if you want technical variety. Rasputitsa hits you with New England mud and weather chaos if you prefer your Vermont gravel with a side of misery."
