Wait a few years before you know if they can actually pull this off."

That's proper adventure territory. 92% dirt roads in varying states of repair through 'demanding technical challenges in unique, ever-changing, inhospitable natural setting' - this isn't some sanitized gravel carnival. You're getting the full Córdoba mountains experience whether you want it or not."

        "explanation": "It's part of a multi-sport 'Experiencia Altas Cumbres' weekend with swimming and running events, which creates more of a festival atmosphere than pure gravel focus. The Traslasierra Valley has solid tourist infrastructure, but with no established race history, the gravel community hasn't had time to develop those deep tribal bonds yet."

        "explanation": "175,000 ARS for the long course gets you UCI points and 120km of legitimate Córdoba mountain suffering. That's about $175 USD at current rates, which is reasonable for a UCI event. But you're paying first-year prices for an unproven product - could be brilliant, could be a shitshow."

      "expenses": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "160km from Córdoba city to the race venue means rental car mandatory, plus lodging in a tourist valley during peak event weekend. International flights to Córdoba aren't cheap, and you're looking at multiple nights since packet pickup runs Friday-Saturday. The 'optimal tourist infrastructure' translates to 'tourist prices' in your wallet."

        "explanation": "The 120km UCI course with 1,930m of elevation gain hits that sweet spot where you're working hard but not entering ultramarathon territory. 35km of continuous climbing until km 68 gives you one massive sustained effort, then 33km of descent to recover and suffer differently. Proper gravel race length that respects your Monday morning."

        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "92% dirt roads in 'varying states of repair' through 'demanding technical challenges' in mountain terrain sounds like legitimate skill testing. Climbing from 900m to 2,270m through Achala Peak isn't just about fitness - you're navigating real mountain roads that don't give a shit about your comfort. The 'inhospitable natural setting' part should tell you everything."

      "elevation": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "1,930m of elevation gain with 35km of climbing concentrated in the first two-thirds makes this a proper mountain gravel race. Starting at 900m and topping out at 2,270m means you're getting legitimate Alpine-style climbing, not rolling hills pretending to be mountains. The gradient profile shows they're not fucking around with the vertical."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "March is late summer in Argentina, which could mean anything from perfect conditions to scorching heat depending on the year.

No historical weather data available to know what you're actually signing up for."

        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Topping out at 2,270m is legitimate altitude that'll make you notice if you're coming from sea level. Starting at 900m means you're climbing through significant elevation zones, and that final altitude is where the air starts getting thin enough to matter. Not Leadville brutal, but enough to separate the prepared from the hopeful."
