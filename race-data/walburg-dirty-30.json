        "explanation": "As a regional Texas gravel race, Walburg Dirty 30 has local recognition and is becoming a growing institution in the Texas gravel scene, but lacks national significance or series affiliation."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Good organization with proper course marking, aid stations, and a festive finish line atmosphere. Solid regional race production without the polish of elite-tier events."

      "experience": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "An enjoyable day of Texas gravel racing with beautiful Hill Country views, a manageable distance, and a welcoming post-race celebration. Riders leave satisfied but not transformed."

      "community": {
        "score": 3,

        "score": 2,

      "value": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Good value for a well-organized 30-mile gravel race. Registration fees are reasonable for a regional event, and you get a quality Texas Hill Country gravel experience without premium pricing."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Registration runs $20. Reasonable total expenses with Austin-area access. Lodging options range from budget to mid-range in Georgetown and Austin. The short distance means minimal gear requirements and travel is straightforward from a major metro area. More affordable than Crusher in the Tushar."

      "length": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "At 30 miles, this falls under the <40mi threshold. It's a manageable single-distance format that works well for both newcomers to gravel and experienced riders looking for a shorter effort. Shorter than Little Sugar MTB."

      "technicality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Texas Hill Country limestone gravel with some rough sections and technical elements, but nothing extreme. The terrain includes ranch roads and rolling hills without singletrack or highly technical descents. Less technical than The Mid South."

      "elevation": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "With 2,000+ feet of climbing over 30 miles, this averages out to steady but moderate climbing. The Texas Hill Country provides rolling terrain rather than sustained mountain climbs. Less climbing than The Mid South."

      "climate": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Historical weather data shows average highs of 66°F and lows of 48°F, with a 37% chance of rain on any given day. December in Texas Hill Country offers mild to cool temperatures (50s-60s°F), which is actually quite pleasant for racing. Occasional cold fronts possible but generally rider-friendly conditions. More weather exposure than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Texas Hill Country sits at relatively low elevation, well below 3,000 feet. No altitude acclimatization required - sea level performance applies. Lower altitude than Gravel Worlds — no thin-air concerns."
      },
      "logistics": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Walburg is located in the Austin metro area, requiring moderate travel planning. Austin-Bergstrom International Airport is nearby, and hotels are available in Georgetown and Austin, though Walburg itself is a small community."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The Texas Hill Country provides memorable ranch scenery, rolling limestone landscapes, and Texas gravel character. While not a bucket-list epic, it offers a distinctively Texan gravel experience with festive post-race atmosphere."
