      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "August racing in Utah high country means hot valley starts with cooler mountain temperatures - pack layers or suffer the consequences.

Weather data is sparse but this is mountain desert climate - expect temperature swings and afternoon thunderstorm potential."

Remote enough to feel adventurous without being dangerously isolated, though specific course routing details remain mysterious."

        "explanation": "Part of the Utah Gravel Series but you won't find pro field depth or national recognition here.

No prize money, no YouTube highlights, just another regional gravel event trying to build its reputation."

The Bigfoot category delivers 10,560 feet of climbing at 77% gravel - that's real suffering properly packaged. Course features 'the Wall' which suggests they understand how to break riders properly."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Heber City location puts you in Utah high country terrain. The Bigfoot folklore angle is either charming or cheesy depending on your tolerance for theme races. 10,560 feet of climbing in the Bigfoot category means you'll earn your finisher photo, but don't expect frills beyond the basic gravel race experience."

      "community": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Utah Gravel Series promotes a 'grassroots feel' and 'groads that smile back' - classic regional series marketing speak. Limited online chatter or race reports suggest a smaller, local community rather than destination event status. The multi-category format indicates they're trying to build participation across ability levels."

      "field_depth": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Regional Utah event without visible pro participation or competitive depth. No race results, winner announcements, or field size data suggests modest participation numbers. This is weekend warrior territory, not where you go to test yourself against serious competition."
