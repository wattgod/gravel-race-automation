All riders must finish by sunset, creating real time pressure that separates this from casual touring. Similar distance to Crusher in the Tushar."

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Course features 'rowdy gravel' through Cherokee and Nantahala National Forests with named challenges including Basin Gap and North River Road climbs. The combination of 'fast descents' and unmarked navigation through forest roads demands technical handling skills beyond smooth gravel paths. Similar technical demands to Gravel Worlds."

Even the shortest 45-mile route climbs 4,100 feet through Bald River terrain. These are substantial elevation totals that will test climbing endurance across all distance options. More climbing than SBT GRVL at the same score."

      "climate": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Late March timing in Tennessee Appalachians hits transition season weather where conditions remain unpredictable. The mandatory lighting requirement for 88-mile riders reaching rest stop 4 after 6:00pm acknowledges potential for finishing in darkness during shorter spring days. More weather exposure than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Tellico Plains starts around 1000 feet and climbs through Cherokee National Forest terrain that stays well under significant altitude thresholds. This is elevation gain through Appalachian ridges, not altitude adaptation - sea-level lungs handle it fine. Lower altitude than Gravel Worlds — no thin-air concerns."

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Routes traverse Cherokee and Nantahala National Forests with 'amazing vistas' along the Cherohala Skyway and Bald River area. Unmarked course navigation through remote forest roads adds self-reliance elements beyond typical supported gravel events."

        "score": 2,

      "experience": {

      "community": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Finish line at the local bakery where riders gather to cheer finishers creates an intimate community feel enhanced by wood-fired pizzas and craft beverages. Optional $25 'high quality, super-comfy triblend' t-shirts suggest attention to rider experience details."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Competitive categories exist only for 63 and 88-mile distances with prizes for top three finishers, while the 45-mile option is positioned as a ride rather than race. Strict time cutoffs force many riders into shorter distances, limiting the competitive field depth. Less competitive depth than Almanzo 100."

The distance options provide flexibility, though the scattered information makes it hard to know what you're actually paying for. Good terrain-to-dollar ratio if you can navigate the organizational confusion."

      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Registration runs $60-100. Tellico Plains location keeps lodging costs reasonable compared to major tourism destinations, with the bakery venue providing convenient packet pickup within walking distance. Remote Appalachian location requires driving but avoids premium pricing of popular gravel destinations. Similar expense level to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

Race conditions can vary significantly with temperatures ranging from pleasant 70-degree weather during the race to much cooler 42-degree temperatures post-race. The course is challenging enough that riders feel accomplished completing it, with some successfully finishing on fat bikes and placing well in their categories. The mountainous Tennessee terrain provides beautiful scenery throughout the event, making it both a physical and visual experience for participants."
