Thinner field than Ouray Gravel Grinder."

of my favorite courses\nit's a beautiful area so lucky to be out\nin alamaki county and to enjoy this\nbeautiful land it really is a special\npart of Iowa and I'm not just saying\nthat because it's one of my races it's I\nthink you'll find that it's just a\nbeautiful experience and looks like\nwe've got some great weather and we have\na slightly updated course just a lot of\na lot of good things so with that let's\ngo ahead and get started I'll point out\nsome of those things that you might want\nto keep in mind as you're racing on\nSaturday\nso as we start out at the beginning of\nthe race the good news and bad news is\nthat the worst gravel on the route is on\nthis first straightaway it's not\nterrible it's not dangerous it's just a\nlittle bit looser we got some big trucks\nthat like to drive on it so until you\nhit the turn right about here and get on\nthe pavement it's just not it's not the\ngreatest grapple but it's the worst that\nyou'll see on the whole route then you\nspend just a few moments getting your\nlegs back under you with some zigzags on\nsome on a pave section do be careful\nthis is a fairly busy road but there's a\nnice wide shoulder then you come you\nmake a quick left and go straight and\nyou go on Van Buren now a little bit of\nHistory here on Van Buren right here\nwhere the the little Bend is where it\ngets it drops down and then it gets\nsteep again this drop and then steep\nsection used to be at the very end of\nthe race which was fun it was fun to\nwatch and it was fun to experience that\nat the end because of changing the start\nlocation\nwe thought we'd experiment seeing what\nhappens when it's at the beginning so\nit's it's looking in good shape it is a\nlittle bit loose so you want to just be\nready for a quick little climb it'll get\nyour heart going but then as you\ncontinue on and make this left\nyou you get a bit of a reprieve\nand a fairly long section down into the\nvalley and this is just a lot of fun and\nI I don't I'm gonna say this a bunch of\ntimes but the gravel is just in great\nshape I hear we've gotten a little bit\nof moisture in the area which I think\nwill hopefully bring down the dust from\nwhat I experienced last week\nbut everything that I was on was in\ngreat shape and I'll verify that in the\nrace report or the the pre-race notes at\nthe start line if we notice anything\nchanges\nbut frankly it's a beautiful little\nMeandering road down into this Valley\nthe temperatures uh cool down a little\nbit so they're going to be a little bit\ncooler than what the what the weatherman\nmaybe reports\nbut it is so much fun to get down to\nthis area and you'll notice some trout\nstreams and you'll probably even Dodge\nsome fishermen out on an early morning\nfishing Expedition keep an eye out for\nthat but keep your head up it's just\njust beautiful all through this then\nright about here you start your first\nlong climb out of the valley\nand it's\npretty wide road so there's plenty of\nrooms for other vehicles to stay to the\nside as you're slowly you're going to be\ngoing at least a little bit slower rate\nheading up this but it doesn't last long\nbecause once you hit that hairpin you go\nstraight back down into the valley and\ncontinue on this nice zigzaggy\nMeandering path through the area that's\nuh that's just really pretty\nso we're getting to yeah we're getting\nclose to about mile 20 here right about\nhere at this road you'll get your first\naid station\nand because it's so much downhill it's\nsurprising how fast that aid station\ncomes but it is nice to have it right\nbefore this climb again back out of the\nvalley and then up onto a short section\nof paved Road it's a little bit longer\nthan it's been in previous years we're\ngetting a little bit more mileage lots\nof people asked why wasn't the walk-on\n100 100 kilometers we had a neutral\nstart in the beginning that kind of\nchanged things and how that worked and\nso we've added this section this is new\nthis year\nso you'll come off of this paved section\non a nice descent turn left and follow\nagain the trout stream and here you get\na a short but pretty fun climb up again\nup onto the through the the fields here\nand just keep an eye out for tractors\nit's harvest time it's seating time and\neverything but then you'll get another\nquick descent down\num be careful on this turn and and then\nback down into the valley\nso right about here is where we turn\nback on to the route that you might be\nused to or might have been on in\nprevious years and then and then left\nthis road is a nice I like it because it\nfeels like it warms up a little bit I\nsometimes get cold along the the water\npass and the trout streams and things\nthis little section is some of my\nfavorite because you get a little bit\nmore sun but it it's really just slight\nRoller Slide uphill and it's also the\npoint at which I know I'm getting close\nto Highlandville\nHighlandville is the really the only\nmajor bit of humanity we come across on\nthe route the store owners are fantastic\nthey do have open up restrooms to\nwriters yep the the store is right there\nand it's if you need something it's a\ngreat place to stop grab a bite to eat\nwhatever and then it's got a quick bit\nof pave section then back onto this\nsmall section here that that kind of\nwanders along and then left a quick up\nand down you get a bit of classic Iowa\nrollers right there and then right onto\nagain a small section of paved\nnow in previous years this left that\nwe're coming on to was uh really crappy\ngravel but it's really looking in good\nshape this year this is a great spot for\nyou to hunker down if there is any wind\nwhich it doesn't look like there's going\nto be much wind this year\nthis is a good play the only the only\nplace where maybe wind becomes a major\nfactor is on this big long straight\nsection\nbut it's a good place to just hunker\ndown and and really get some speed\nbecause it's flat and straight and then\nyou take another and this is a descent\ndownhill get a couple rollers down and\nthen as you're taking this right hand\nturn you will you'll go up a little bit\nclimb a little bit and then right about\nhere you actually get your second aid\nstation already so that'll come and feel\na little bit quick but it'll be\nsurprising how fast you'll be at 42\nmiles already at this point\nand then\nfrom here\nthis section dips goes again along the\nthe edge of the Ridge and then it dips\ndown into one of the last valleys and\nI think the hard part about describing\nand commenting on this course is that\nit's just so pleasant to be on even this\nshort climb this is one of the the\nsmaller climbs that you have on the\nsecond or yeah on the last third of the\nrace they're not big they're and they're\nfairly gentle and so you'll wind your\nway around following\ngoing Downstream with the The Wider\nRiver here\njust really Pleasant off to the left\nyou'll see a rock outcroppings and I\nthink I came across and startled\nsomething like 10 or 12 Deer when I was\nout on the route last week so I'm sure\nyou'll you might experience that as well\njust keep an eye out for the Wildlife\nand then and then another quick descent\nhere as you get close to Ferris Mill is\nthe last climb that you'll have out of\non the course up to the the finish line\nand it starts\nright here at this right hand turn\nand Ferris Mill is one of my favorite\nsections it's it's unfortunate that's at\nthe end because you're a little bit\ntired and it is an uphill but it's\nreally gentle very pleasant nice and\nShady usually you don't have to worry\ntoo much about any sort of weather\nissues or heat issues baking you on the\nlast part of this this route because\nit's it's fairly protected down in the\nvalley and you get this nice long climb\nout\nyou'll spend more time with the river\nit's really pretty really beautiful\nthere are several Bridges if you're one\nto stop and take pictures I think there\nare a few on the on this route there's\nat least two metal bridges that are\nthey're fun to get a picture on so we\nwill we'll have photographers out on the\non the course but I don't believe we\nhave them on any of the bridges so just\nmaybe keep that in mind if you do want\nto get get a picture\nmaybe next year we'll think about more\nabout those locations that we want to\nhave them\nbut yeah as you slowly climb it you'll\ndefinitely feel the climb as you're\ncoming out of here but it's not\naggressive I think probably the steepest\npart of Ferris Mill is right here as you\nturn right and come up this section and\nthen you'll make a right onto a kitten\nthe worst gravel on the route but once\nyou get over a quick rise you'll be able\nto see the the the steeple of the church\nin the distance and that's your target\npoint so just hammer it down and and\nwe'll get you a cold something to drink\nand that is the walk-on 100 for 2023\nwe're super excited to have you",

          "transcript": "hey everybody well thank you so much uh\nwe've got a group of fantastic folks\ntogether this is the my name is chris\nmcqueen and this is the first of maybe\nwho knows maybe more uh i don't know but\nwe're i'm calling it the iowa gravel\nseries uh podium podcast that's an\nopportunity for us to get together and\ntalk about racing from those that are\nstanding on the podium maybe learn a\nlittle bit from those folks so we're\ngonna\ndo a round of introductions uh i i'll uh\nkind of go first like i said my name is\nchris mcqueen i'm the race director i\nlive in glenwood iowa\non the far western side of iowa and\none of the questions that i kind of\nasked everybody as they introduced as\nthey introduced themselves is like why\ndid they get into gravel\nand\ni don't have a great answer for that um\nso maybe i'll but i'll probably get to\nanswer this question many times if i if\nwe end up doing this more\nbut uh my uh my reason for getting into\ngravel is because it's there it's like\nright out my front door i'm fortunate\nenough to live in the loess hills and\nit's really easy for me to get out\nand uh get on some gravel roads really\nreally fast and i love it like i grew up\nwith uh out west riding fire roads and\nit's just it's just the kind of it's the\nkind of writing that\nconnects me with my childhood so\nthat's a little bit about me we'll get\nmore into what this is and and maybe\nmore but let's go ahead and start with\nintroductions from the fine folks that\nwe have on here\nuh jonathan can you kick us off or\njonathan white live in council bluffs\niowa so a little bit north of chris and\nchris and i knew each other long before\nthe iowa gravel series\nso i race gravel because that's where\nthe races are if it were up to me it\nwould be crits\nbut the crits dried up and the gravel\nrace has started so that's why i'm doing\ngravel i guess it's safer than road but\nroot road is smoother and funner and\nmountain biking is pretty fun too\nso i do all three of them but gravel's a\ngood time as well\nthey pass it off to do i pass it off to\nsomeone else yeah go ahead and pass it\noff to someone else will surprise\neverybody claire\nokay my name is claire o'leary i live in\nminneapolis minnesota and i got in the\ngravel because i\ni started off bike racing in cyclocross\nand i started that on a sibling bet\nand gravel is just kind of the natural\nprogression for um you know the rest of\nthe year and and like jonathan said it's\nwhere the races are\nso did did you win the bet claire\num i don't know if it's necessarily\nwinning but occasionally i get texts\nfrom my brother that involve like i made\na monster\nso probably\nnice\nwell who would you pick next to\nfor um travis\nokay\nuh i'm travis lowens i live in omaha\nnebraska\num\nwhy gravel\ni think there's lots of reasons um\ni think the biggest one is that it's\nlike jonathan said it's a little bit\nsafer there's less traffic out there um\nit's accessible enough from here and\nto be honest just like claire and\njonathan said it's where the races are\nright now um there's a lot of them\nnearby\nthey keep popping up so\nit's there it also kind of suits my\npower profile a little bit better i'm\nnot no sprinter at all don't really have\na lot of high anaerobic capacity but i\ncan usually pull high tempo for a while\nso that usually works out okay for\ngravel\nlet's shoot on over to derek\nhi uh i'm derek henshide uh iowa city\niowa\ni kind of got into gravel just from like\npeer pressure and wanting to go to new\nareas it opens up some especially\ni mean just everywhere it opens up so\nmuch more\nplaces to ride which is great\num i haven't done any racing really\nbefore this i actually just started\nriding gravel last fall\num did it did a race and then kind of\ngot hooked with some local people\nso yeah are you are you still friends\nwith these folks that are that peer\npressured you into it derek um yeah\nyeah i mean it was a good move i think\num because i was\nyeah\nit's just been a lot of fun going all\nover the place to find new places to\nride\num how about uh phil\nhey so i'm phil seim i live just south\nof la crosse wisconsin so pretty close\nto minnesota\nuh nice gravel over there and also a few\nmiles three three four miles from my\nhouse i got some amazing gravel roads\ni got into gravel\nuh kind of the opposite of jonathan i\ndon't like crits and i don't like road\nracing\nit does crits for sure do not suit my\npower profile that punchy stuff\nis not me i i like to like put my head\ndown and just grind away at tempo for\n20 30 minutes and that's that's what i\nlove\nso that's why i got into it and i\ncouldn't see myself to anything else\nuh carrie anne\nall right so kyriann pappas i live in\nomaha nebraska\nactually came here from minneapolis\nclaire so nice to be back at my roots\num how i got into gravel i started in\nthe world of triathlon and after doing\nthat for i don't know six years eight\nyears\nrealized that i really was not a very\ngood swimmer and i really was a pretty\ngood cyclist and a pretty good runner so\ni've really focused on the cycling um\nthat's where my friends are that's where\ni've met great friends\num i think it's also partly my way of\nof reconnecting with\nmy farming background i grew up farming\nin north dakota and i just love to get\nout and see the countryside i love to\nsee different areas and definitely\ngravel lets you do that\nyeah i that that's\ngetting out and that that whole\nexploration thing and and just kind of\nbeing out in those in those more remote\nareas is something that's\nreally\nhelped me love it do you do you swim at\nall anymore or you you kind of stopped\nswimming\nno so um yeah\nthat was some of the notes i made when\nyou were talking about training is\ndefinitely still do\nbelieve in the multi-sport like i really\nthink that it's really good to have\nother sports to fall back on and\nswimming is one of those where it's very\nlow impact and to be a great cardio\nworkout\nso i do still i still do run swim bike\nlift all of that but um\nthis year especially only racing um only\nracing gravel okay well i might\nwe'll get more into training things like\nthat i've i definitely am a big fan of\nlike the multi-sport training and stuff\nbut it means that i'm crap at pretty\nmuch everything so\nuh\njust try to do my best\nall right well thank you again uh for\nbeing here and uh\nfor kind of kicking things off i wanna\nfor kind of our first few questions um\nuh i i want to touch on just just\nbriefly\ntraining and nutrition and gear and\nrecovery today i i did also throw out\nsome questions onto the socials and got\na few people out with some kind of very\nspecific questions and so if you have\nany insights on those i think i sent\nthose out to you ahead of time\nbut uh let's let's go ahead and start\noff with kind of like a little bit of a\na training overview\nuh i went and tried to stock your strava\na little bit\nand uh so i went out and and looked and\ntried to see what i could find and\nso i'm gonna i'm gonna start with\njonathan i'm gonna give him a little bit\nof crap because i think he's a liar\nso looking at his strava it says that he\nhas about\nmaybe a hundred miles a week and i think\nthat's complete bs like\njonathan what is three weeks i haven't\ndone 100 miles for sure oh yeah i\nhaven't touched my i haven't touched my\nbike but\nyeah for those that don't know uh and\nwe'll talk about this because we have a\nsection on on recovery um\njonathan had an unfortunate uh went down\nat unbound here three weeks ago and\nbroke his foot pretty bad\nso we'll\ndefinitely want to talk a little bit\nmore about that but here's my question\njonathan are you a phenom at only\nriding about 100 miles a week or are you\na complete liar on strava\nno i mean i was i was training for\nunbound and so i was putting in a lot of\ntime a lot of miles there's only really\none way to do that and that's to\nspend the time on the bike and so\nyear to date i did do a lot of riding\nand i don't hide anything on strava a\nlot of other racers will they won't put\nup their race rides because they think\nthat if\nthey think that if we know their power\nprofile somehow we'll be able to beat\nthem but i just put it all up\nso what what is your training\nlook like usually when you're not you\nknow broken and everything like what how\nmany miles and what what are you doing\nbeyond that it depends on what i'm\nprepping for and what bike i'm on so\ntypically i go by day of the week\nmonday is an average day i don't do\nanything hard just get the legs ready\nfor tuesday and wednesday tuesday and\nwednesday i'll do back-to-back hard\nrides whether that's\ni mean it depends on what i'm getting\nready for interval work\nor some hard laps at lewis and clark a\ntrack out here so i'll put in hard rides\nthose days and then i'll take thursday\noff\nand then friday is usually a shakeout\nride to get ready for whatever race i'm\ndoing on saturday\nand then i take sunday off as well so if\nyou're if you're doing if you're doing a\ncentury or 100 mile gravel ride and\nstuff how how many miles are you trying\nto put in during the week then\nso if i'm prepping for a hundred mile\ngravel ride i kind of think more about\nwhat kind of power am i going to put out\nso i'd probably focus a lot of time on\nmy sweet spot in the few weeks getting\nready for that that's kind of i don't i\ndon't remember i know what my number is\nbut i don't remember all the names in\nthe zones and so i i'd spend a lot of\ntime there\num just getting ready for what i think i\nwould need to do in that event but if\ni'm also getting ready for a mountain\nbike race\ni do a lot more higher intensity work so\nit kind of depends on what i'm tuning\nmyself up for okay cool well i want to\nhear from other folks as well so uh\ncarrie anne uh kind of going down my\nlist i don't i don't have it in any sort\nof order i could not find you on strava\ni don't know if you are\nif you're just a and that's fine if if\nyou're not a social person i don't think\ni i don't think everybody has to have\neverything on strava or whatever but i'm\ncurious uh hearing that you're a you\nknow triathlete what is your what does\nyour training week kind of look like and\nhow many miles are you trying to put in\nin the different areas yep so i'll start\nwith yeah you couldn't find me on strava\ni'm not there um\ni i just haven't succumbed to that\nsocial media force yet so maybe someday\num so from a mile percent\nit really varies i would say a lot like\njonathan just said like what is really\ncoming up um\ntypically i believe you can get a really\ngood workout in an hour so that hour you\nknow can get some really good intensity\num i probably am on my bike at least\nfour days a week\nuh maybe five say i don't have i don't\ngo by days maybe like jonathan did\ni'm more what does my week look like how\nam i bouncing that with my other sports\nthat i might be doing with public\ncommitments i might have\nso typically um\ndo any one easy ride one like group ride\nthat sort of fills my soul um it's not\nall easy it's not all hard but there's\nsome roadies that i love to ride with\nso get out with them\num try to go out then and do two other\nworkouts and that workout could be a\nrace this week it was a race weekend um\nand then i had done\num two like 12 minute intervals\non a road bike actually so i don't spend\nall my time on any one particular bike\nnecessarily either\num i guess i'm a believer that\nabout eighty percent of my work is going\nto be pretty easy down in that zone two\ntwenty percent of it's going to be up\nmaybe even above race intensity for me\nso hitting like a zone four or five um\nfor that 20\nis is kind of how i train\nnumber of miles wow um it varies it's\nall over the board from\nprobably over 300 sometimes to down\ncloser to\nyou know race 70 this weekend so it's\nprobably more like 120 mile a week this\nlast\nweek kind of tapering off just a little\nbit right before the race sort of thing\nyeah yeah and then you know 70 of it was\nrace so\ngotcha okay so yeah i kind of hit that\n80 20 as my big rule get get on the bike\nfour times a week big believer in our\nworkouts if that's what you've got make\nthe most of it i think you can get some\ngreat workouts in an hour\ngreat\noh well and we might we might come back\nto swimming and stuff but uh i want to\nget get kind of around the horn real\nquick travis\ni saw from you about 140 miles a week on\nyour strava\nand i didn't i didn't dig too hard i\ndidn't go\nweek by week everything but saw some\nzwifting in the winter and everything\nwhat how would you describe your your\nyour your training routine your weekly\ntraining routine\nyeah um\ni would say i'm about\nprobably 80 of my time is on zwift even\nduring the summer time uh just works\nbetter with my schedule um i can get up\nin the morning\nget an hour hour and a half in on zwift\num monday through friday\nmost of the time\num and saturdays are kind of my outdoor\nday so saturdays are generally\num anywhere two to four hours outside\nso yeah a lot of it's indoors it just\nworks really well for me it's a\ncontrolled environment too so that\nreally helps\nzwift has just been\nreally amazing for me\nas far as there's community on there as\nwell i do it three days a week mondays\nwednesdays and fridays i do a group ride\nin the mornings it's the uh kiss at base\nride if anyone wants to join\nit's a good group of people from all\naround the world um there's different\nlevels to uh levels of people to ride\nwith um\nso those are kind of like a group ride\nday i kind of pick either a sea ride if\ni want an easy day or maybe a b ride if\ni want more of like a tempo-ish kind of\nthe day\ntuesdays and thursdays are usually come\nwhen i are my hard days depending on\nwhat i'm looking at\ntraining wise where i'm at in the season\ni might be doing\nsweet spot and trying to push out my\ntime and zone and sweet spot or i might\neither get closer to race date work on\nvo2 max\ntype work really to get that high end\ngoing and then been trying to get some\nanaerobic capacity type stuff in as well\nbut that's usually closer to race date\nso\nyeah monday wednesdays fridays kind of a\nnice fun group ride tuesdays thursdays\nhard days saturdays are\nhard and long\nif i can\nwe could probably have a huge\nconversation about indoor training and\nand zwift in particular i i moved off of\nzwift and onto trainer road because i\nfound that i\ncould not stop racing with zwift like i\nwould get out there and like i could not\nkeep myself under control so trainer\nroad just made sure that i didn't do\nsomething stupid\nuh that's fair but but i love it i think\nit's beautiful it's totally fun all\nright claire let's head over to you i uh\nlooking at you i was seeing somewhere\naround 120 to 200 miles a week but also\ni saw some things that definitely\nimpressed me where i was like oh\nshe's got a sub four hour marathon time\non there and a 12 minute 5k run time\nso okay that's an error um\nthat was probably a bike and probably\nfrom years ago but continue and then\ni'll get it\ni saw i saw a little bit of zwift on\nthere and maybe some some gym uh rock\nclimbing indoor gym rock climbing stuff\nso um\nit looked like you're actually more of\nlike a three to one\nyou know three times as much run as much\nas bike so i'm curious what what kind of\nlike at least on zwift again i'm just\ni'm just going off of like i'm not on\nzwift on strava i saw\n1700 runs and 500 rides so i was like oh\nmaybe she's more of a runner\nso i'm a con\num i ran in high school in college after\nthat i did ultras i actually ran 50\nmiles before i ever rode 50 miles\num and then it kind of you know around\nor so 2018 2019 there was an overlap of\nyou know sibling heckling of buy a bike\nand do a real sport running is dumb with\nreally paying the price for some long\nchronic injuries that came up during\ncollege had surgery you know got through\nit but they kept coming back and dealing\nwith that and finally being like\nyou know i i can't run the way i want to\nanymore and hey biking is really fun and\nyou can race that too\nokay so what's your work what's your\nworkout week look like right now\num mondays are usually rest days\ntuesdays are going to be harder workouts\nperiod\nperiodized of like doing some like\nthreshold intervals now um\nand then it depending on how much time i\nhave maybe an hour to after the\nintervals to\nwednesdays are kind of a longish day\nthursday it's just an hour spin\nreally nice usually like to like wear a\nt-shirt or like go mess around on some\ntrails or go to where our local\ncyclocross races are and like invent a\nnew course in my head\num fridays are also interval workouts\nand then saturday and sunday is getting\nthe miles and the time when i can if i\ncan get out to gravel great um sometimes\nhit some group rides just a little bit\nof whatever the weekend looks like\ngotcha very cool all right\nall right let's get to let's get to\nderrick and phil real quick and then\nwe'll get into some some meteor\nquestions and stuff so derek\nso i saw what i saw was something around\n400 miles a week\nlike 20 hours 20 hours on the bike and i\nthink you said at the beginning you're\nlike i just kind of started into this\nthing like i'm just just new\nnew to gravel new to gravel i have like\ni said i never rode competitively but\ni've ridden and run for like the last 10\nyears i mean constantly on the road\num but yeah i'm putting in\ni don't have a real training plan i just\nride when i can\num which is i have a lot of time\num yeah\non tuesdays there's a group ride that's\na road group ride that's usually pretty\ncan get pretty hard that i try to join\nwhen i can but um\nwith my kids schedule and my wife's\nschedule i don't i usually can't make\nthat and like um travis said yeah i\nswift a lot just because it works with\nmy schedule like i can\nmy kids are old enough that they can\nplay with stuff and i can ride inside\nwhere\nand so that's when i get it in\nso i mean are you looking at maybe two\nhours uh you know a day sort of thing uh\neither on zwift or outside or in the\nmorning evening when when do you head\nout would be confident\nmost weekdays yeah it's somewhere around\ntwo hours um\na day\nand then on the weekends i'll do a lot a\nlonger ride like today i did with five\nhours\nuh wednesday is another i do a a more\nlaid-back group ride but um that's\npretty fun it's like our local gravel\ngroup ride\num and\nyeah i mean that that's pretty much like\ni said i don't have a plan really\num i've started like as i as i've now\nstarting to do things competitively\ni am like trying to maybe target\nspecific areas do workouts that target\nyou know my um you know vo2 and stuff\nlike that but\nyeah i don't\nthat's as structured as it gets\nwell i mean it's working because you you\nwon you won came in with a great time at\nwalk on and you know you're definitely\nputting the time in on the bike so you\nknow yeah so so good things are\nhappening\nuh phil i could not find you on strava i\ndon't know if you're are you there or\nare you i am\ni am i'm probably you have to request to\nfollow me i have some of my stuff hidden\ni don't know why just weird i guess\nbut yeah so i do i do like 150 to 200\nmiles a week on average um\nmondays and fridays are my rest days\nand then i'll try to do one to two hard\nrides a week so we have a local\nit's called tuesday night worlds\nand it's kind of like a race simulation\nso that's i count that as my intervals\nwhenever that's going on so that'd be my\nhard one of my hard days and then on my\neasier days i just do lots and lots of\nzone two\nuh so like endurance pace and that's\nusually for multiple hours and i've just\nfound that's\nthat's best for me for building fitness\nbecause i feel great the next day i can\ngo do it again\nyou know after intervals sometimes you'd\nfeel beat up and you didn't really\nreally get back on the bike i've noticed\nthat right away the next day so i can\njust go do zone two\nnext day just go do zone two again\nso that's what seems to work good for me\nwell that makes sense all right so uh i\ndon't want i wanna\nlike i said i'm still figuring out like\nhow to time all this and get us enough\ntime and this is kind of a big group\nthis is essentially two podiums this is\nbasically\nwalk-on and silver city\num so we got a lot of folks in here and\nso kind of lightning-ish round uh but\nnot not really i'm curious\nwhen was the first time you went from\nlike and this is going to be hard but i\nwanted to get this story in so as quick\nas you can i'm curious when did it go\nfrom like hey\ni'm riding a bike to oh\ni'm i'm going out and i'm racing my bike\nnow like when did that mental shift\nabout what age or what time frame did\nthat happen in your head where you're\nlike\nhey i'm a person that can ride a bike\nand i've been out on a bike and\neverything and now it's like no no i i'm\nriding a bike with purpose because i'm\ngonna go out and i'm gonna race\nso i'm gonna go kind of backwards here\nuh phil what when did that mind shift\nhappen to you do you remember that\nyeah so some like mid-30s now so i'd say\nprobably\n10 years ago so like 25-ish i was at one\nof these tuesday night rides and i it\nwas like my first time going to it and\none of the local\nyou know i guess local legends you go\ni'd call him just a really strong writer\nhe's like hey you're kind of you're\npretty strong rider you should you know\nyou should try some races and just see\nsee what happens so i i tried some crits\nlike i said i didn't enjoy crisp i did\npretty well so then i uh\nfound my passion and gravel but yeah\nit's yeah mid-20s and just luckily\nsomebody kind of said pushed me and said\nhey you kind of look like you're a\ndecent rider so maybe you should try\nthis\nokay so about five years ago that that\nshift derek how about you\nwell yeah it was a couple years ago\nlike i'm 33 now but a couple years ago\nwhere i kind of realized that i'm pretty\ngood on the bike but i never was\ninterested in competing until like i\nsaid last fall i started riding gravel i\ndid\na couple races a couple like sort of\nlike phil said a couple of local guys\nlike noticed\nthat i mean i took third place in my\nfirst race and i soloed 90 miles of it\nand almost caught the two league guys\nbut so one of those guys was the one who\nkind of was like hey you should join our\nteam and um from there that's when i\nstarted i guess being more competitive\nabout it yeah\nthat makes sense that that's that was\nactually one of my questions if there\nwas well we'll we'll get to that i guess\nwith the lightning round a little bit\nmore about like have you ever won a race\nwithout\nor got on a podium without training or\nprepping for it\num claire when did that shift happen in\nyour mind between like hey i\ni just ride or i just run but no i i'm\nout there to compete\nuh probably 2021 i did a little bit of\ncyclocross racing in 2019\nbut then um kind of the transition from\nrunning to\nreally like being more into biking and\nactually training on the bike and not\njust going out and punching around um\nreally kind of happened in like 2020 in\nthe 2021 took a lot of clinics for like\ncyclocross skills and and all those\noff-road handling skills\num and then kind of went from there\nso were you trying to compete when you\nwere doing the cycle across i mean were\nyou getting into it for fitness or were\nyou getting into it for to be\ncompetitive\num i wouldn't say those first races were\nvery competitive i took out a lot of\ntape um just like crashing into things\nbut\ni mean trying but at the same time\nwasn't really on the bike you know six\ndays a week or doing intervals or\nanything like that\nyeah okay very cool uh travis when did\nthat shift in your mind go from i ride\nto irace\ni started riding bikes\nas an adult and shoot 12\n11 years ago something like that\ni'm almost 42 now so it was i was 30 31\nwhen i started riding um just kind of\nriding around with my brother for a\nwhile and then\nhe was a lot faster than me and i wanted\nto get faster to just\nbe kind of his pace and\nthe training bug kind of hit me um i\nlike data and i like kind of\nfiguring those kinds of things out so\nthey started playing with that and\nlearning about training and then\ngot into racing and\nagain just the training and all that i\nactually probably like training more\nthan i do like racing sometimes um\nyeah it was maybe 11 12 or yeah 11 years\nago or so i did crits mountain bikes\ncyclocross stuff and now i just kind of\nsettle into gravel and zwift\nokay very cool\nuh carriane i i mean you you've\nyou've had quite a you have a lot of\nexperience in a couple different fields\nso uh\nyou can mention about the the writing\nand stuff but i'm interested about kind\nof the overall competitiveness for you\nso really started um\nriding actually in my 40s so lower end\nof my 40s i'm in the lower end of my 50s\nnow so i was probably about 11 12 years\nago that i really got into the triathlon\nside of things and riding my bike and\ndoing that for racing took a couple\nyears but\nhad success in that so i think that like\nthe mindset the shift there from just\nriding to racing was pretty quick\num from a\nbike perspective at first\nspecifically cycling\num it was probably about six years ago\nand i was on a group ride and and\nsimilar where somebody just encouraged\nme to jump in with the faster group of\nguys\nand it was like oh no no no i don't\nbelong with them and they're like no\njust go hang on as long as you can and\nyou know i think slowly that just built\nup my strength and probably my\nconfidence around cycling and it's still\none of those points where even i still\nride with a group of guys and they're\nlike yeah we remember that day just\nsuddenly you were there and it was but\nthat was like the confidence i think\ncame and i\ni had the fitness i'd been doing it for\nfive or six years\nbut didn't maybe have the confidence in\nthe bike handling skills and\nmaybe the endurance at that time and\nit's really grown from there over the\nsix years\nspecifically on gravel i'd say the shift\nwas probably around a little after\nclaire um so that's when i i really\nstarted focusing more on gravel and\ntraining even a lot more specifically\nfor cycling\nit's been a couple years\nit's it is super helpful to have that\ngroup to kind of say come on let's let's\ndo that and i think that's that's a\nreally good thing for gravel and cycling\nin general it's it is that it is a group\nthing\njonathan i i kind of imagine you came\nout of the womb competitively if you had\nhad a twin you probably would have\nelbowed that twin out but that's that's\njust my\nmy caricature of you know knowing you a\nlittle bit\nokay but tell me the truth when when did\nyou when did you go from like i'm doing\nsomething to no i need to win do you\nwhat do you remember\nso i i started racing bmx bikes when i\nwas 10.\nbecame a runner and then bought a road\nbike when i was 21 and raced later that\nyear it's never been a ride it's always\nbeen a race\nwell uh actually there's a guy i was\ntalking to just the other day wants to\nput in a big bmx track in council bluffs\nso we might need to chat about that and\nsee if we can figure out that'll be a\ngood way to get injured\neverybody's worried about crit races and\nwe're starting up bmx tracks\nall right well we've gone around the\nhorn a couple times so i'm gonna throw\nout some other questions that we got\nfrom the social groups and if if you\ndon't have any input or answers on these\nthings you know don't worry about you\ndon't don't need to chime in please do\nif you if you do have thoughts on this\nspecifically around training um there\nwere some questions about like people\nwere like hey what courtney neil asked\nyou know i can't get to crowd gravel all\nthe time what other training do you find\nhelpful so maybe any strong opinions\nfrom the group on what you feel is the\nmost helpful for specifically gravel\ntraining when you can't get to the\ni can take this since i live in\nminneapolis and the closest gravel is\nprobably 20 miles\num so just a lot of just road race or\nroad riding you know building strength\nthrough intervals\nand then as far as off-road handling\nskills even just you know doing\ncornering in a park and\nand stuff like i do for cyclocross and\nthen also riding mountain bike trails on\na drop bar bike\nsome of the more mellow ones but really\nunder biking things and getting used to\nwhat it feels like to\nto slide out you know really helps for\ngravel racing if you overcook a turn and\nall of a sudden your rear end is going\nout knowing how to save that is huge\nyeah no i think that's especially i like\nthe i like that going out and just being\non the mountain bike and anything else\nfrom the group on that one any\nsuggestions for courtney\nheadlifting\ndead lifting yeah getting in the in the\ngym how many just by kind of raise their\nhands how many of you do anything in the\ngym just weight stuff\njust dead lifting\num oh okay and do do any of you uh work\nwith a coach\nunless you count myself\neveryone's self-coached so i did one\nseason to kind of get a feel for how it\nis and then\nno one can coach you better than\nyourself if you know what you're doing\nfor me oh sorry oh no you're you're fine\nphil for those\ncoach yeah go ahead\ni'm just going to add on same thing i\ndid use coach for about a year and kind\nof learned what they had to offer and\nit's like okay a lot i learned got a lot\nof good knowledge but after that year\nit's like okay i think\nyou know i can kind of take this and run\nnow and change things up to while they\nwork for you based on that\nuh base knowledge\nyeah i'll probably take the opposite\nperspective on that if i could afford a\ncoach i would 100 get a coach\ni think\ni think you can delude yourself\nsometimes or you can maybe not do what\nyou really need to do because you don't\nreally like it\nand sometimes the accountability could\nbe good too\ni just it's just too much money for me\nto do it\nhas anyone done any like peer coaching\nwhere they've just maybe talked to a\nfriend sorry go ahead claire you had\nyour hand up\nhe's gonna say oh sorry i was just gonna\nsay i've done some of that peer coaching\ntype stuff and i'm i'm it's not that i\ncan't afford i just\ni haven't wanted to pay for a coach\nbecause but i do agree the\naccountability part of it though it's\nlike if i'm paying someone to tell me\nwhat to do i'm probably more likely to\nlisten than my friend telling me hey you\nshould work on this instead of doing the\nexact same thing every day but\nso i do work with a coach i think i'm\nthe only one in this group and for me\nit's accountability but not so much of\ndoing it it's like not doing stupid\nthings and some i have a especially\nthrough you know running in in college\nand stuff and afterwards i have a track\nrecord of doing horrendously stupid\nthings and burning myself out in a\nthousand different ways and sometimes\nit's nice to have someone tell you that\nyou're an idiot and don't do that\nso you have a problem with the moore's\nbetter philosophy of athleticism you're\nlike just always faster always better is\nthat a challenge for you\nabsolutely yeah\nso what do you agree with\nover over training i have an issue with\nthat's why i stopped running because i\nkept hurting myself it's harder to hurt\nyourself with over training on the bike\nat least like stress fractures and\npulled muscles and stuff\nyeah absolutely\num all right so maybe let's talk a\nlittle bit about planning then for the\nyear um what uh when do you start\nplanning your your season like how how\ndo you plan things out are you like ah\ntake it month by month or do you start\nway back in december and plan out your\nwhole season through september october\nwe probably don't have time for\neverybody but i'm curious what what some\nof the different philosophies are there\ngo for it\nfirst well again like i said earlier i\njust started getting into racing but i\nthink ideally it's probably looking at\nsmaller races month by month and\nto see how far they are far away then\naway they are work on my wife's schedule\nbigger events where there's you know\nthey're going to fill up you'd probably\nwant to start looking earlier to make\nsure you can get signed up and not get\nput on a waitlist\nthat's my experience so far i guess but\nagain i'm pretty green in this\nwho who's like i'm looking for someone\nwho's like oh no i planned this out in\ni planned like months and months in\nadvance who anybody on that end\ni'll start usually in\nlike november december kind of looking\nat maybe one or two races that i really\nwant to do well at next year\nand then kind of count back the weeks or\nthe months back from that and kind of\nstart a periodized training plan\num just a real general i don't lay out\nworkouts until probably maybe a couple\nof weeks ahead of time but\nwhat kind of layout here's kind of my\nbase phase and here's where i'll start\nworking on threshold and that kind of\nstuff but yeah i'll start november\ndecember\ndoes\nthank you thanks does anybody just\nwing it completely they're like i don't\nplan until like oh that one looks good\nand then you know they they go and sign\nup a couple weeks in advance and that's\njust how every race is\nno no no one wings it that much\ni mean i will i will sign up for\nsomething a week out um but i don't like\ni don't know i do just yeah\nbecause i get friends who'll be like hey\nyou should do this race and i'm like\nokay i'll go do that race\nyeah and i also think that um i'm a big\nbeliever that consistency is like really\nsuper important so in general i have\nthat base so i can go do that 100k or\n100 mile race\num i'm guessing that we've all kind of\ngot that base and so yeah a week before\nhey it looks like it's great weather at\nsilver city chris i was signing up the\nmore that morning up which i'm so glad\nyou did\nyeah yeah\num you know so it it it is a little bit\nof like because i've got the base\nbecause i've done the training because\ni've got the miles\ni feel really good just jumping into\nthose races right now um\ni i think if i was\nbut i i also know that i have started\nwith the plan of these are the three or\nfour races that i'm doing and they just\nare adding to my\nto my build\nall right all right\nwell i i could we probably\ni'm gonna learn a lot about doing these\ni probably could spend\na whole hour-long conversation about\nevery one of them so i'm going to move\non a little bit onto\nnutrition on the bike\num there were some questions and one by\nlisa morman who actually ended up on the\npodium at walk on\nshe's she was looking at like hey\nshe's got some gi distress issues very\nsensitive stomach and so curious if\nthere's anybody else with like sensitive\nstomachs and any tips on what to do with\nfood and hydration or\nany any sensitive stomachs in the group\ni don't i don't know that i say i have a\nsensitive stomach other than\nsometimes i just don't feel like eating\ncertain things on the bike\nlike even gels or\nlike chews i just sometimes they just\ndon't taste good to me so what i found\nworks best for me is just\nsome sort of uh hydration mix so\nthis year i'm trying flow formula\nso it's like\ni forget 350 calories per bottle or\nsomething like that\nand then last year i use the scratch\nsuper fuel that's similar i think that's\nlike 400 calories per bottle and that's\nliterally all i'll have for\na race if it's\nunder six seven hours that's all i have\nis hydration mix and that seems to i\ndon't have any gi issues from that\nif it gets over six seven hours then i\nmaybe have like some sort of a bar some\nsort of real food just to mix it up\nbut otherwise it's just straight\nhydration mix\ngotcha\num what what's other people's mix what\ndo they do to make sure their their\nstomach stays nice\nto them\ni'm similar as far as i do mostly liquid\nnutrition\ni kind of settle on making my own i just\nget bulk maltodextrin bulk fructose\nand i use like\nhydration tablets from science and sport\nor hammer or something like that so i'll\njust kind of mix up a ratio that i think\nhas been working for me i've kind of\ndialed it in over the last few years\nusually what i've settled on now is 50\ngrams of dextra or maltodextrin in a\nbottle and 25 grams of fructose and then\nadd an electrolyte tablet to it for the\nflavor and the the electrolytes and all\nthat kind of stuff and try to do a\nbottle an hour of that that's\nabout 300 calories then i'll have a\ni like sis gels so i use those maybe one\nor two an hour\nthat works for\neverything but hot races i found if it's\nhot i need more water\num and i haven't quite nailed that one\ndown that's where the gi is distressed\nwill usually come in for me is i don't\nhave enough water\nto replace what i'm sweating out and\nthen you have too much sugar in the\nsystem and not enough water and then\nyour gut just\ndoes not like that\nthat's my theory anyway yeah i\ndefinitely felt that at\ndown in arkansas this last week and i i\nwas eating and i was sweating i had\nplenty of moist you know i i wasn't\nbonking but i did my stomach did was not\nhappy with me\nuh anybody else so\nsounds like a lot of hydration uh\nuh you know getting the calories through\nyour bottle and everything anybody like\nnot prefer that preferred it's like\nplease i want to choose something i want\nsomething else but let's go with you\nyeah yeah i have to choose stuff i think\nmaybe it's from like the running days\nwhere you have to rely on that so much\nmore but like\ni mean\nmy bottles usually don't have any\ncalories it'll be water and then maybe\nnoon with electrolytes and then um just\nyou know eating clif bars dates like\nginger snap crackers fruit snacks just\nwhatever i can throw in my dirty pockets\nbasically gotcha jonathan what's what's\nyour what's your setup right now when it\ncomes to\nto fueling\nuh i eat and drink as much as i possibly\ncan\nwhat kind of what kind of food are\nwhat's your go-to's right now\nwell on the bike cliff bars\nreally like what you got a favorite\nflavor cliff bars and gatorade\nuh white chocolate macadamia i think oh\nyeah that is my grocery store and so\nwhen i'm on my way and i for i can just\nbuy it on my way to the event\nnice nice\nchris i have a couple things um my\nbackground is actually in food so i\nthink something really important for\nlisa is to really read labels and\nunderstand what she's seen when she does\nread those\num there's a lot of different ways that\nyou can get your sugar i know travis you\ntalked about your maltodextrin your\ndextrose and there's fructose and\nthere's sucrose and there's a lot of\ndifferent\ndifferent types of sugars inulin can\nalso sometimes fall in that camp and\nthey're all going to affect your gi\nsystem differently and they're going to\naffect you differently on a short race\nor versus a long rice versus heat versus\nnot heat and so for her for lisa unders\ntrying some different things and\nunderstanding what works and knowing why\nand what those differences are\nwould be my really first kind of step in\nall of that\num because you do have to get your\ncalories in you've got to get your\nhydration in\nand then you can get into some of the\nmore specifics like\nwhat exactly electrolytes do i need what\nexactly other macros might i need but\num learn to read your labels and kind of\nknow what you're putting in and you're\ngoing to figure out i think what works\nand what doesn't work yeah i i think so\nmuch of being an athlete is learning to\nbe a scientist almost so for you for\nyour science personally for your body\nand so say on a hot day on a\nyou know a century\na standard century or 100 mile you know\na longer-ish race what are you thinking\nabout what kind of sugars and things our\nmixer are you thinking of carry-on for\nyou\nyeah so i typically stick more with a\nsucrose on a long hot day\num but i hit a day a month ago where it\ntasted terrible and all i could really\nget into me was like a fizz or a noon\ntype thing so i ate mid-race had to\nreally reevaluate my calories because i\ni eat and drink much like jonathan as\nmuch as i can\num throughout the entire race so you\nkind of need to be ready and to be\nadaptable also\nall right it is definitely something i\nthink it's tricky for everybody and it\nseems to change as you get a little bit\nolder as well and so it's it's it's\nadjusting those let's hit on um\ngear real quick and maybe a quick thing\non recovery and then we'll we'll jump\ninto that lightning round and so uh\nhopefully we can keep this close to time\nuh so there was a question uh\nsomeone oh shoot i forgot to put their\nname down i'll i'll see if i can put in\nthe show notes or whatever\nthey've signed up for sarah cooper's\niowa gravel classic how many of you have\ndone that one before are familiar with\nwinterset in that area carrie anne has\ni've not done it but i know the area\nokay it looks so yeah\nyeah i don't know how much i don't know\nhow big this person is but he he had a\nquestion about like he's got maxis\nramblers size 40s on there and he's\nwondering if that's a good choice for an\niowa gravel classic\ni don't know how that's pretty specific\ni've i've ridden that\ntire um it it's fine it doesn't roll out\nas quickly as say\nvictoria tereno zero which is what i\nalways ride\nbut it's a good enough tire nothing\nwrong with it except maybe it's a little\nbit too aggressive of a tread pattern i\nfeel like in gravel\ntraction has more to do with volume and\nair pressure less to do with tread\ni think especially in iowa where it\ntends to be a finer grain like we we\ndon't get the bigger chunky stuff i\nthink that's true any other opinions on\non the maxis or how what size tire you\nprefer to be on for for iowa gravel\ni've i've also used the maxis rambler\nsame 40 millimeter size it's like\njonathan said it's a great tire but yeah\nit might be a little overkill i'm used\nto the well all i've done in iowa really\nis the walk-on\nuh gravel and if it's anything like that\nyeah i would definitely probably be\noverkill i think for that type of gravel\nyeah i think that area you you it's\nsimilar i think walk-ons a little bit\nfiner stuff or or or more refined like\nthat they're not complicated roads um\nthe class b roads it does get a little\nbit of you know sandy uh out there so\ni don't know derek did you have a\nthought you wanted to throw in there oh\ni was just gonna say yeah from the walk\non 100 yeah a lot of the roads are like\nthat but you do find throughout iowa\nsome spots because i've run a lot like i\nsaid i live in iowa city but i've ridden\nall over in iowa and sometimes you do\nfind some of that chunkier gravel\nbut i'm not an expert on gear i just\nrode what my like i said i just got my\ngravel bike last fall i've been riding\nthe uh um\nspecialized uh whatever they're called i\ncan't remember\nbut 42\nwhich ones\npathfinders yeah the past five years 42s\nand they've served me well so far\nyeah they got that center bead down the\nmiddle that\ncan be fast on some stuff and other\nstuff i've felt like i was slipping out\non on them a little bit\nall right so\ncurious is there any go-to\nuh kit or gear that you make sure that\nyou have on every race um\nyou know kind of that that stuff that's\nin your saddle bag maybe maybe does\neverybody ride with a saddle bag and\nlike a tool kit or do you just like yolo\nit and\nif if you don't make it you just make\nsure to call someone\ni always bring a plug or a couple plug\nsome sort of plug kit that's a lifesaver\nbecause you don't want to be putting in\ntubes if you're in a race because you've\njust lost\nspecifically dyna plug\nexactly a number of other plugs that do\nnot work the little the little pill\nthings\ndo not work yeah dynamic plug\nyeah i someone's i think dyna plug is\nwhat they used and that totally saved my\nlife here on this last race um i think\nis that is that the one where you you\nconnect the co2 cartridge to\nthe the spike so you just jam it in\nthere and you open up the co2 cartridge\nand and then when you pull it out it\nleaves the plug in or is that different\nthere's no the one i have the dyno plug\ni have is no co2 it's just like it's\nsimilar to what you'd plug a car tire\nwith but it's way smaller\nand it just it's just like a sticky\nblack and\nit looks like if you looked at it you'd\nsay there's no way this is going to plug\na tire but i've used them four or five\ntimes and they work every single time\nthey're amazing\nthe\nthe one that someone someone saved my\nlife with it was a dyna plug it's the\ndynaplug air and it it's so it's all\ndone by dyna plug the same dynaplug sort\nof uh setup but you put your co2\ncartridge on it directly\nand what i thought was genius about this\nis that you throw it into you you find\nyour hole you throw it right in\nand then you fill the tube up right\nthere and then when you pull it out it's\nplugged and done\nand i think that's my next purchase\nbecause it was i have a co2 cartridge\nand i have a plug system but this looked\nvery neat and actually would probably\nsave me a little weight and headache so\ni don't\ni'm not i i don't dyna plug is not a\nsponsor of the iowa gravel series but i\nmight need to reach out to them because\ni'm kind of sold they saved my life on\nthis last race\nuh all right and\nall right let's let's move on to\nrecovery here a little bit so this is\nwhere i want to get into jonathan's\nstory and also anybody else that's had\nto kind of like bounce back from like a\nmajor injury so i'd love a couple\nstories here\njonathan you had an experience in at\nunbound tell us a little bit about that\nand you can\nuh i haven't yet marked these things\nexplicit but you know\nyou can use whatever language you feel\nnecessary no i'm far enough away i don't\neven think i used profanity when it\nhappened but uh five miles into unbound\njust\nwriters being erratic and someone\nslammed on their brakes\ncausing someone else to swerve into my\nfront tire and i went down at a pretty\nfast clip i broke my calcaneus that's\nthe heel bone in two different places\nand so i'm\nhalfway through my convalescence before\ni can put weight on that\nprobably won't get to race until next\nyear again if i want to\nif i want to heal right and race right\nwow so what what are you doing i mean\nthat that's really that there's a lot of\ndifferent types of injuries and and\neverything but a foot injury can be\nspecifically tricky for like training\nkeeping your fitness up so what\nwhat are you doing what what are kind of\nyour thoughts as you as you go through\nthis process\nthere's not much i can do to to keep my\nfitness besides watch my diet and make\nsure i don't gain weight\ni'm working closely with a physical\ntherapist his name is mike bartels he's\na cyclist and an absolute genius when it\nwhen it comes to body mechanics and how\nto apply those to cycling yeah you can\nwork with him to minimize the problems\nthat i have as i come back\nyeah mike bartel edge physical fitness\nhe's over in omaha bellevue area\npapillion edge physical therapy yeah\nyeah he he's great i've worked with him\nas well um\nwhat\nwell i'll throw it out to the group as\nanybody else had to bounce back from a\nmajor injury what what kind of was the\nsituation there what did you do\nwell i i wasn't racing competitively but\ni did have to sort of bounce back from\nas the last marathon i ran i ran the\nlast like five miles i tore my groin\nmuscle\ni ran through the tear it was dumb so i\njust made everything worse\num but the way that yeah i mean i came\nback\num thankfully with that you could as\nlong as you don't do you know like\nneuromuscular like hard type efforts\nit's okay to ride the bike so i just was\nindoor training um for a while after\nthat\nwithout you couldn't do any pull motion\nso it's like i wrote without clips i\njust wrote on flats\njust basically figuring out what kind of\nexercise you know what you can do to try\nto maintain\nany fitness without furthering your\ninjury and obviously with the foot\ninjury it's going to be even worse i\nwould\nsay um with my running background i have\nhad a number of big injuries i mean\nthat's half the reason i'm in biking now\nincluding having surgery about 10 years\nago and with that you know it was a\ncouple weeks in a cast on crutches for\nlike eight weeks and you know with\nsomething like that you know you're\ngonna start at zero so in some ways it's\nlike figuring out how to build that\nbetter and not necessarily saving what\nyou had\nyeah with this group it makes it sound\nlike the best way to become a good\ngravel cyclist is to be an injured\nrunner\nlet's talk maybe and if anybody else has\na story in here that can kind of relate\nto this like what about that mental part\nof it like there's yes there's healing\nthe body but what about kind of the\nmental\nkeeping your head in the game when\nyou're feeling kind of broken what\nanything anything there\nyou maybe add on or talk about\nso for me i'm very grateful it wasn't a\nmore serious injury it\nit very easily could have been a\nlife-altering injury not just a six-week\nthing so\nvery grateful for that but it had that\neven even though it wasn't serious it's\ngiven me a much different perspective\nbecause you know i have\nfour kids and a wife and a career and\nthis has made me realize that i really\nneed to spend more time on my bike\n[Laughter]\nit's really it's really the gratitude\nand understanding you know what's\nimportant in life that i think is what\njonathan's point pointing out there and\ni i appreciate that\nlet's be i was going to say speaking of\nthe kids those it's really important i\nthink to have the support of your family\nlike i'm sure that they are very\nbefore your injury they want me out on\nmy bike more than i want me out on my\nbike\nyeah that's that's every yes every\nvacation we go on i have to bring my\nbike because they know i'm gonna be much\nbetter to be around if i get a ride in\nyeah some people get angry and we get we\nget bikery\nuh all right well i i don't i don't want\nto take us over too much on time i've\ngot a little bit of a lightning round\nhere\nand so\nwe'll do i've got a bunch of questions\nwe can do kind of like just raise the\nhands this is kind of like have you ever\nsort of thing so if you answer yes kind\nof raise your hand and then at the end\ni have a a a finish this sentence\nuh sort of questions i got four finish\nthis sentence so\nand then we'll we'll kind of wrap this\nup so thank you so much for for being\nthere this is this is great um all right\nlightning round question first one\nhave you ever puked on a ride\ngot a couple all right uh have you uh\nhave you ever skipped work to get in a\ntraining ride\na couple okay\nuh have you ever entered a race without\ntraining for it like going in zero\ntraining\nclaire i mean train specifically for it\nor just not training at all just no\nnothing just going nothing\ni don't know i'm always writing so i\nguess i can't say yes yeah\nokay fair enough um have you ever\nentered a race without training for it\nand won so this would be maybe yeah\nyou're just you just went off of your\nbase sort of thing but you weren't\ntraining specifically for it\nagain i i don't really train\nspecifically for anything i haven't had\na big enough event yet so gotcha all\nright um have you ever turned back on a\nride because you forgot your gps or your\nhead unit you're like i can't go out\nthere\ncarry ann's like yes\ni never forget it\nbut i would turn around\nyeah all right um have you have you ever\ngiven someone your tube pump co2\ncartridge on a race\nphil gary carrian\nclaire jonathan did i see a hand you\nmight have to put the hands up high okay\ni can't remember\nit sounds like it doesn't sound like me\nbut somehow i remember doing it\num have you ever had someone give you a\ntube or pump or co2 on a race\ndefinitely i got a jacket from an aid\nstation volunteer when i um got very\nnear hypothermia this year\noh\nnot exactly the question that definitely\nsaved me\nyeah i like the volunteers\nyeah i\nlike aid station angels and things like\nthat i very much i am so grateful for i\nhad a tube stuck in you know wrapped up\nunderneath my saddlebag and everything i\nthought it was fine\narkansas was too bumpy it bumped out and\ni ended up having to bum\na tube off someone so i'm grateful for\nthose um have you ever drafted someone\nfor 75 or more of a race and then beat\nthem at the end\nno hands up\nclass acts um\num but have you ever had to stay on\nsomeone's wheel to survive a ride or\nanything\nall of all of you that's that's awesome\num all right let's do finish uh finish\nthis sentence um maybe just just a\ncouple i can jump in if you feel like\nyou've got a good answer\num so the first one is\nuh you know fill in the blank i'm so\nglad my mom doesn't know i blank when i\nrace\ndo 45 miles an hour down a gravel\ndescent\nthis is just one word sorry\nthat's fine\nthat's a good one yeah yeah\nokay next one\nbike packing is blank\ni technically didn't i don't know i'm\ntechnically bike packed across iowa\nmyself so i don't know\nso claire you said dumb\nyeah i see the the appeal i haven't done\nit um i did do a big portion of a pretty\nfamous bike packing route in minnesota\non the north shore this past week but i\njust did about 100-ish miles of it and\njust banged it out in a day\nand i didn't i only had to carry half as\nmuch stuff it was great\nyou like carry less stuff right faster\nyou know that's the answer\nseems like a lot of planning\nall right\nnext one uh uci starting a gravel series\nis blank\nirrelevant\nirrelevant it's a good question good\nanswer\nall right all right good uh what was the\nuh phil did you say something else i saw\ni heard it relevant mine was less\npolitically correct\nlet's go with jonathan's\nall right and this one everybody can\njump in if you like um i wish i'd\nlearned blank\nsooner that i don't have to hammer it uh\nthe whole ride\nthat's how i started out racing and then\ni realized oh i can work with people so\nwhat else uh you wish you learned sooner\nhow to deadlift you wish you started\ndead lifting sooner yeah okay i i guess\ni i need to try this i need to try this\ndo more carry\non\ni'm gonna defer to claire while i keep\nthinking okay claire what's ready\nyeah for me i would say like how to have\nconfidence in my abilities and my bike\nhandling and fitness and everything\nyeah that's great\nall right well folks i tried really hard\nto keep this kind of close to an hour\nyou have been fantastic i'm going to go\nahead and wrap this up stay on just for\na moment and and uh we'll uh we'll wrap\nup but\nthank you i want to put it thanks for\nputting on the series thanks for putting\non the series guys thank you\nthank you uh you guys are very kind i\nappreciate it i want to put a big shout\nout as well to our sponsors bike rags uh\nthey're great they provide our jerseys\nwe've got xx2i that's uh providing\nsunglasses for everybody and uh\nour newest sponsor and caller it's me\nit's men's like\ndress wear so we're going to have to\nfigure out something comparable for the\nfor the women's division make sure that\neverybody looks good on and off the bike\nbut we'll figure that out so with that\nthank you so much and\nhave a fantastic gravel time",

you today I've\ngot Ian Frank I'm sorry Ian Frank I\nshouldn't have asked you Ian while we\nwere just chatting just to make sure I\ngot your name right but um and he was uh\nthird place in the 50k at the walkon 100\nhere in 2024 uh I believe it was his\nfirst race uh with us this season and uh\nwe have not really chatted much at all\nso this is going to be a wonderful\nconversation where we get to go get to\nknow each other and get to uh hear a\nlittle bit about learn a little bit\nabout Ian and how he got into gravel\nracing Ian thank you so much for being\nhere Chris thanks for having me and\nthanks for all you do to promote gravel\nracing and and\nthroughout the state of Iowa um I think\nit's really special what you've been\nbuilding and uh it's a big part of the\ncommunity so thank you oh you're thank\nthank you I mean it doesn't happen\nwithout folks like you signing up for\nthese things and saying yeah this is\nthis is how I want to spend my Saturday\nmorning um Ian did I get your name right\nyes yeah you nailed it so no no problem\nthere I stumbled over it because I was\nlike oh shoot I usually try to ask and\nmake sure I get everybody's name\nbeforehand but I definitely that that\nwill oops I messed this thing up very\nwell might be the theme of this episode\ngiven uh some of the things that\nhappened at walkon but we'll we'll I'm\nsure we'll get into that Ian let's I I'd\nlove to start off a little bit with like\nuh you know who you are where you're\nliving and how you got into cycling kind\nof like what what your cycling uh uh\nexperience\nis yeah sure in a nutshell I live in\nborf Iowa um I work in the Rock Island\nIllinois so I'm kind of here in the Quad\nCities and uh grew up here and um really\num early on I was active so I um ran a\nlot ran a lot of cross country and track\nand high school and college and you know\ncontinued that for a period of time um\nand then uh eventually you know just\nyour body kind of wears out a little bit\nfrom running I I think this has happened\nto a lot of people and um transition to\ncycling so um bought my first road bike\nwhen I turned 40 so I'm 52 now so it's\n12 years ago and um over time um kind of\ngravitated more to the uh the gravel\nside of things and I've really enjoyed\nthat so been um riding a gravel bike for\nsix seven years and U I've been entering\nraces and doing uh that sort of thing\nfor the past three or four years so um\njust kind of my Evolution you know from\nbeing active uh this is where I'm at\nright now and um I really enjoy it I\nreally do oh wow that's sweet I mean\ncoming into it at 40 I mean had you I'm\nwe got to go a little bit back in time\nbecause I have to assume that you\ngetting on a bike at 40 was not the\nfirst time you got on a bike like do you\nhave any memories of like your first\ntime riding bikes and like kind of like\nI mean did you ride bikes at all Maybe\nI'm Wrong maybe maybe 40 was the first\ntime you ever put your you know you ever\ngot on a bike no I mean I think riding a\nbike was just a mode of transportation\nfor me before you know everybody when\nthey're kids biking everywhere biking to\nschool um all around town so yeah that\nwas a big thing and um when I was in\ncollege you know parking was at a\npremium um on our campus so I I would\nbike everywhere uh for that that was\nthat was pretty fun and then um yeah\njust kind of uh got away from it you\nknow after a while and um probably\nwasn't on a bike from late 20s until I\ndid turn 40 honestly so my main activity\nwas running and just kind of busy with\nlife and um um had gotten back to it\nuntil then so did uh what was it like\ngetting into the bike scene for you did\nyou have a a buddy that kind of helped\nyou out with the equipment thing or did\nyou just kind of jump in What what was\nyour process to be like okay the knees\nhurt let's go get a\nbike yeah well um I talked to a few\nfolks so I was\nprobably you know I was always pretty\nfit and then you know kind of late 30s\nlittle out of shape and um you know that\n40 is kind of a big mark a lot of people\nlike noticed that oh hey I'm turning 40\nso uh started talking to some folks you\nknow that were into cycling just some\nguys in my neighborhood and um you know\nended up buying that first bike and um\nyou\nknow and I still to this day I don't do\na ton of group rides and things like\nthat but uh really just kind of got into\nit on my own and um it's it's kind of a\nrelease for me you know like just kind\nof a stress relief and uh you know\nsometimes just biking on my own is um\nkind of therapeutic for me you know\nafter uh you know a long week at work or\na long day um you can just kind of\nunwind and you know still get some\nexercise and um you know that's that's\nkind of um where the value was initially\nand that just kind of got into a routine\nand set some mileage goals and over the\nyears just you know um became you know\npretty pretty avid as far as that goes\nand you know a lot of support from my my\nwife and our son and you know they they\nunderstand that uh you know it's it's a\ngood outlet for me yeah no I think I\nthink a lot of cyclists um they get into\nit and they'll say man cycling may be\nexpensive you know because there's\nequipment and there's there's apparel\nand there's all the gear and stuff and\nyou add a GPS or whatever and it you\nknow can add up a little bit but they\nyou know a lot of folks will say well\nit's it's cheaper than my therapist and\nand you know you can you can do both you\nknow that's that's totally fine as well\nbut like um cycling for me has always\nbeen the place where I found like I can\nhave really good conversations um often\njust with\nmyself uh and go and uh and clear my\nhead and everything is there do you have\nare you kind of one of those folks that\nhas like your set route or are you are\nyou one that like okay time to go get on\na ride and you try to explore what's\nwhat's your style yeah so I'll explore\non the gravel roads um quite a bit you\nknow and I'm pretty fortunate I live in\nNorth Bendorf and uh a mile or two north\nof me there's you know probably 100\nmiles of gravel roads and um you know\nI'm pretty familiar with with all those\npaths and um you know feel very\nfortunate to have that where I can get\nout for 90 minutes and maybe just see a\nfew cars um so I enjoy that when it\ncomes to riding on the roads I'm um a\nlot more selective with the routes I\nchoose so um you know I may get some\nLoops going you know a little bit back\nand forth six seven eight mile Loops\nthings of that nature but um I just feel\nlike it's overall like a safety side for\nme and then quite honestly half the time\num I'm riding on my trainer in the\nbasement so\num you know I have a zift account and uh\nyou know smart trainer and there's\nthere's a good spot for that and you\nknow I've gotten in some pretty good\nworkouts and um you know it's a good\nfallback plan when it's uh like this\ntime of year when it's dark at 4:30 and\num you know you still want to get a\nworkout out in so yeah do you have do\nyou have a a favorite uh how long have\nyou been doing zift oh man um quite a\nwhile uh probably uh 2019 2020 um yeah\nokay quite a bit so uh when they redid\nthe I I did zift for a little while I\nactually stopped doing zift because I\nwould end up racing too much like every\none of my workups workouts ended up\nbeing like Tempo higher whatever I just\ncould I would get caught up in it too\nmuch so I ended up switching over to\ntrainer Road for most of my stuff\nanymore but I I do love zwift and like\nAl to Swift and all that and everything\nbut when they changed the points system\nover here recently um and they redid the\nlevels and everything what was that\nexperience for you or the racing side of\nit ra racing and like like all your you\nknow the drop points and like your\nlevels and everything yeah the levels\nwere funny um yeah it just seemed like\nit was a real slow progression for a\nwhile and then um I think the uh the\nratings changed so you leveled up a lot\nfaster um so so that was interesting I\nmean I don't pay too much attention to\nthat but um yeah you do you do notice it\nand then um especially this time of year\nI start jumping in some of the races so\num they give you uh an assignment and um\nit's fun I mean it's just you know\nbreaks things up and it's amazing to me\nsometimes you do get caught up in it\nlike you said and you know you could do\na 20 or 30 minute race and just be\ncompletely smoked at the end of it um\nand uh you do get caught up in it but\nyou know it's it beats the alternative\nback in the olden days of just having a\nyou know a trainer staring at a wall or\nwatching a game on TV so um yeah\nalternative so what what's the most fun\nthat you have I mean you know zift\nprobably isn't as fun as you know\ngetting out and exploring in the area or\nwhatever but what is it that keeps you\ncoming back to is it the is it the\nracing is do you find that's the the\nbiggest thing or what's I just think\nit's easy man you know the training it's\nit's an easy thing to do I can go in my\nbasement um you know try not to pick up\nmy phone when it when um I'm biking but\nyeah if there's something going on or um\nyou know it's something important I can\nkind of check that and I know it sounds\nkind of lame but it it's a good um it's\na good quick workout and um you know the\nweather's the same in my basement every\nsingle time I don't have to layer up and\nuh don't have to worry about there's no\ncars in my basement you know there's uh\nno wind no no rain so it's it's a good\neasy alternative that said I do you know\nprefer to be outside obviously um you on\ngravel whenever I can so yeah so I mean\nhave you you said you're doing a little\nbit more racing and everything do you\nare you structuring your plans and your\nworkouts around certain fitness goals\nwere you kind of aiming for the podium\nas you uh in your training and things or\nuh or are you more of a yeah what what\ntends to be the focus of you mentioned\nthe mental health aspects but what tends\nto be maybe the focus of your your\ntraining more structured or more like\njust purely\nFitness um I'd say it's primarily\nFitness I've done some structured\ntraining and some workouts and um that's\ngood I'm a competitive person um you\nknow that said for me to get on the\npodium is pretty rare um I was on a\nmaster Podium for a hell of the wind\nearly this year and then you know third\nin in your race um other than that I'm\nusually living more like you know that\n10th to 15th spot um in a lot of these\nraces but um yeah I I do enjoy them and\nand I like racing I like being\ncompetitive I like you know the whole\npart of it trying to hang on to the\ngroup if you if you fall off the back\nyou know trying to reconnect or watching\nhow things develop as the race goes on\num so I do enjoy that\num but yeah it's the primary thing is\nprobably Fitness Wellness my sanity you\nknow like this uh release I talked about\nbut um yeah I've always been competitive\nback to uh you know junior high school\nand uh I guess once you have that in you\nyou kind of it's hard to let go yeah\nit's hard to well and it's I you know\nit's something that I uh I grew up and I\nthink I I literally got this from my\ngrandfather through my dad and\neverything there was kind of like a an\nanti-competitive and for me now somehow\nfalling into this uh situation of being\na race director I see how much value\nthere is in having a good healthy\ncompetitive\nsportsmanship outlook on life you know\ncompetition is good we live in a very\ncompetitive society and that's not a bad\nthing and uh so I I I have a deep regard\nfor those that that come with a strong\ncompetitive Zeal I can tell you story\nabout my wife and how much I've come to\nappreciate her competitive seal and\neverything but I I don't think that's a\nbad thing can you tell me uh a little\nbit about your your early success with\nkind of that that spark that maybe\nhappened with the that you realized oh I\nI not only maybe am competitive but I\ncan compete and I I enjoy\nthat yeah I I think um you know I\nprobably got in a little bit better\nshape up my mileage four or five years\nago so my goal's always been like 10,\nmiles a year and um I I haven't hit that\nevery year but that's that's always the\ngoal and um after I did that you know I\nwas doing some just whatever's close and\neasy some um the kandic CR and Iowa City\num Corridor they have a time trial\nSeries so I do some of that just do the\nBreakaway race and uh you know the non-\narrow and then our bike club has a few\nof those so it's trying to do some of\nthose things and you know just trying to\nhold a decent effort for you know those\nshorter races um and then yeah I've\nprobably done a total of 15 gravel races\nnow um you know primarily with your big\nriver here on this side of the state and\nthen you know now trying your year event\nout up in wakan and um I do\nenjoy both series because I think they\ncater to the uh competitive folks the\nfolks in the middle who are just you\nknow trying to get a good hard workout\nin riding groups and then there's\nusually some other folks that just\nhaving fun you know and and they're just\nout there and uh I I think it's cool um\nmaybe that's more the gravel Community\nwhere you you have that that Bond and it\nkind of goes from you know the first\nfolks across the line all the way to the\nlast and everyone's hanging out watching\neveryone come in and finish and um I\nthink that's that's pretty fun um and\nthat said I really did enjoy that wakan\nrace with the sweeping bends through the\nriver valley you know the the gravel and\num you know Decor is beautiful it's a\nlot different than anything else in\nEastern Iowa and um that was a cool\ncourse and um it it was interesting I\nactually uh took a bad line early on and\num you know dropped my chain and went\ndown got a little scratched up but it\nwas it was my own fault um because I\nhadn't really paid attention to the\ncourse and we came into a a B- Road\npretty early and um was it that very\nfirst B Road one with the big dip and\nthen the The Rock or was it later on it\nhad to be like four or five miles into\nthe race okay yeah pretty early and um\nyeah it was all on me and I didn't\naffect anyone else so I felt good about\nthat but then I I probably spent from\nthat point all the way up to the last\nmile riding by myself trying to uh reel\nin the guys uh ahead of me and um it was\nit was fun I was really pushing myself\nbut uh also trying to take in the uh the\nriver valley and then you know the folks\nfishing and you threw in a few\nchallenging Hills there so uh yeah that\nthat caught my attention I tried not to\nI try not to put all the challenging\nHills in but there you know hopefully\nwithin when within measure um you know\nthere's enough to to to keep it up there\ndid you go into that race trying to keep\nI mean it sounds like you always are\ntrying to kind of stay onto a group\nbecause certainly that's a lot more fun\neverything but do were did you go into\nit with kind of looking around at the\nfield and I mean had you done your\nresearch did you know who might be there\nand were thinking about ahead of time or\nwere you just kind of like\nwell what what what comes what comes\nlike where were you on that so there's\none one uh one guy Joe tabber who I know\nwho's from the Quad Cities and he was in\nthat race um so we're kind of somewhat\nclose to each other um he's probably\nbeaten me more than I've beaten him but\nbut I knew I knew Joe but no one else\nreally in the race and um I was kind of\ntrying to gauge off of him um but yeah\nhe ended up breaking away and I he had\nto be at least two minutes ahead of me\nat the end um but yeah everybody\neverything else was new to me and um I\nenjoyed it I hung out afterwards talked\nto a few folks and uh met some new\npeople and it's always fun to kind of\nshare stories and uh you know talk about\nthe course in the day and um yeah I\nthink everybody had a lot of positive\nthings to say about the the course it\nwas it was very uh very Scenic and\nchallenging and yeah it was it was good\nevent had you ever ridden up there\nbefore is that your first time in the uh\nthe driftless hills I've been um inora\nbefore but I've never ridden up there so\num you know this event worked well for\nour schedule and uh I'm like all right\nI'm gonna go uh go give this one a shot\nso um it was cool it was laid out well\nand well thought through so well thank\nyou um you mentioned you were part of a\nbike club what what bike club are you\npart of well so I I ride with well\nthere's the Quad City Bike Club that's\nkind of an overall group here in in our\narea and then um I ride with the fit wve\nteam which is a lot of the guys that are\ndoing uh the Big River Series so um\nthat's a pretty cool team because we\nhave everything from um a guy who's 15\nor he might probably 16 now um up to you\nknow some guys in their mid-50s and um\nthey're all pretty pretty competitive\nand uh good guys and uh so that's fun\nand then there's a few informal group\nrides that we have here on um week\nnights so um I try to get out and do\nthose and I usually ride from a local\nBrewery or um bike shops and uh yeah\nit's been um it's been good the\ncommunity is growing and um you know I\nwould say there's probably at least 50\npeople in the quad cities that are\nriding gravel on a pretty serious and\nregular basis and um you know I don't\nthink it was like that five or six years\nago yeah that's that's really cool and I\nI've been a big fan of you know what uh\noh shoot I'm forgetting his name who's\nrunning\nBig River who who's from fit wve Luke\nLuke yeah yeah um you know I've not\nunfortunately I'm on the Far West End of\nIowa and so my availability to get all\nthe way out to the other side of Iowa is\nis is rare at times and um it's\nsomething where like I I've been\nthinking about it a lot for this year is\ntrying to get on more races that are not\nmy own um it gets a little difficult\nwhen you have seven races of your own\nyou have to be that you have to be to um\nbut it uh it is kind of a goal that I\nhave uh more for this year what um what\nspeaking of kind of like goals given\nthat we're kind of at the end of the\nseason what have you set out a race\nschedule for next year are there things\nthat you're looking at for next year\nthat you're like hey I want to go do\nthis um not anything too specific I mean\nI I'm probably liveing within an hour or\ntwo of here which would be um you know\nbig Grover or big Grove I'm sorry Big\nRiver series or anything out in your uh\nEastern Iowa you know events so that's\nkind of what what I'll Target for and\nwe'll just have to see how the schedule\num you know lines up like our son's a\nsenior in high school and he's into\nsports and you know we'll work around uh\nhis schedule because you know that's the\npriority I want to you know be able to\nattend those things and uh yeah but um\nI'll definitely try to you know sign up\nfor I don't know half dozen events Poss\nand and get out there and and get after\nit so um yeah no no stated one you know\na race that you're you're looking at you\nknow because I I mean cor cor for is out\nthere in that in that area is that\nsomething that you've done or you would\nbe interested in doing I've talked to\nsome folks that have done that yeah and\nthey um speak very highly of it and uh\nsuper challenging from the sounds of it\num especially you know if you're trying\nto race it all the way through um but\nyeah I would like to um get to the point\nwhere I'm doing some longer events I\nmean I've only done a couple 100ks and\nuh I live primarily in that 50k area so\num you know I just try to uh get out to\nwhat I can um you know I've got a fairly\nbusy work schedule too so um you know\nthere's just moving Parts but um I'm\ndefinitely gonna make it work and try to\nget out as much as I can so yeah no\nthere's always a lot to juggle this is\nand this is we had a quick chat ahead of\ntime and uh I've never said this out\nloud but I think I think um it rings\ntrue to me that like the the Iowa gravel\nseries uh you know we try to make it\nkind of like the the busy person's easy\nto get on the race on the Saturday\nmorning sort of uh uh event and that\nthat means that it's it's hard to juggle\nand it means that you have to get up a\nlittle bit earlier probably to to get to\nthese things because we do start them\nearly so that we can kind of have\neverybody back by lunch and stuff but uh\num it's for me it's I love the fact that\nwe we are having an opportunity to\ngather and get to know folks and extend\nour uh you know our our Network so to\nspeak of people in gravel and gather\ntogether um I'm curious uh you know we\nif uh if there was one thing this is a\nquestion I often ask folks if there was\none thing that you could change inside\nof the gravel world or just kind of\nmagic wand away are there is there\nanything inside of cycling or graveling\nwhere you're like man if I if I could\njust make this happen it'd be\nfantastic yeah you know put less rock\ndown on County Roads sometimes my Lord\nlike there's a few uh Scott County is uh\nthey they put a lot of rockdown so\nsometimes that uh you know you can kind\nof turn on a road next thing you know\nyou're uh cruising along at 17 18 miles\nan hour and then you're down to like 13\num but no with the events I I really do\nthink that um you know your series is on\nto something I think Big River is is on\nto something um he's actually lot's\nactually uh put on a couple events in\nIllinois which I think opens up some\nopportunities for people from you know\nPoria or the Chicago suburbs too so um\nsome of those folks enjoy getting out\nbut um yeah I probably prefer the gravel\nover um you know the other forms of\ncycling at this point um but yeah I\nwouldn't I\nwouldn't you know anything I would\nchange beyond my control dogs chasing me\nwhere I have to miles an hour to you\nknow save myself or uh you know the\nthick rock those are my two pet peeves\nbut uh can't control well I mean you\nknow the Eastern side of Iowa does tend\nto be a little bit flatter so I mean for\nyou truly to get your card toio you you\nreally should just get more dogs chasing\nyou I me that really helps give you that\nthat need to to to step it up yeah I\nthink I almost pulled my quad last time\num yeah those those dogs keep getting\nfaster I think um it's hard to hard to\nget away do you have a go-to method to\nlike are you a squirt bottle squirter\nare you a just ra Rome like what's your\nmethod for ducks because I growing up in\nI grew up cycling uh you know mostly\nmountain biking up in the mountains in\nthe in the in the west and so dogs just\nweren't a problem until I came to the\nMidwest I'm like what is going on so I'm\ncurious always curious about t the\nvarious tactics that people are using to\nyeah I just try to go as fast as I can\nfortunately I hav't haven't been chased\nup a hill yet I think that might spell\nthe end ofy um yeah no I usually try to\nsay something to him or you know in all\nseriousness really like it's dangerous\nfor the dog it's dangerous for the rider\nyou know you don't want to hit the dog\nand cause harm and uh it's dangerous for\nus you know as we're riding because you\nknow don't want to dog bite you don't\nwant to go down um and you know I've\nseen it in even in a gravel race too um\nwhere it's a little bit more serious\nbecause you got a big group of people so\nyeah I don't know what the answer is to\nthat so I don't know what it is for for\neverybody I my technique and again my\ntechnique does not work for a lot of\npeople unfortunately but I have I was\nblessed with a like a a pretty serious\ndad Voice or pretty good yell yeah I can\nput I can put out a pretty strong no\nreally loud um and uh and so usually\nthat stops them in their tracks when\nthey get just a strong like\ndirect pointing know sort of thing but\nnot not all of them it there's\ndefinitely been times where\nunfortunately I use my strong voice and\nthen I'm like oh crud I'm out of breath\nyeah I didn't have enough to run so yeah\nI don't know what the solution is you\nabsolutely nail it that you know it's it\nis something that we kind of a danger\nthat we have to kind of manage in the\narea unfortunately but um well cool well\num let's see here I I I'm think we're\nprobably about time and I so I don't\nwant to take up your whole night but\num kind of as as a last question here\nIan as you think about like your racing\nexperience and then and this season what\nwas probably your favorite thing from\nthis last 2024 season for you what's\nwhat's the thing that you look back on\nand go that was great so it's it's\nprobably inside of two races right so um\nand wakan I was I was pretty happy to uh\nlose the group and then catch back um\neven though it\ntook 20 plus miles um so I was pretty\nhappy with that I was really I could see\nsee folks ahead of me and um was kind of\ncounting the time you know like as they\nwent around the corner I'm like all\nright I'm 30 seconds back or I'm 15\nseconds back and um was able to catch\ntwo guys and the younger Rider from\nsugar bottom he he outsprinted me at the\nend and then the um you know I was I was\nin between him and fourth place um you\nknow the race too um was the Big River\nRace out in Erie Illinois and uh I was\npretty happy with with that one um I\ndidn't get a Podium but I was 10th and\nthe field was super competitive um\nsimilar type situation I fell off the\nleague group but um was kind of solo got\nscooped up by a second group and then\nwas able to um ride home with with those\nguys and and and got past a few folks so\num that was fun that race was super fast\num it had a uh you know a flatter layout\nand then um the funny thing with that\ncourse too um you know with Big River\nLuke put a BMX track in that um so we\nwere riding uh I don't know 10 miles to\ngo and you uh go through this BMX track\nand you're kind of going over these\nHills and uh around this bend that had\nsome mud on it and then um we came back\nout and uh I was just pretty happy to\nmake it through that upright so that was\nfun yeah that is fun we're we're looking\nat some some different formats for this\nyear next year Glenwood out this way has\nalways had a bit of a mixed surface\nactually one of the hardest things with\nwakan is getting anything but beautiful\ngravel because in that area it's either\npaved or it's really nice gravel we like\nthat's the only bit of B that uh I I've\nfound on that route that's worth doing\nis is on the walk-on 100 so we we\nstruggle to get variety and surfaces\nthere but man it's such a beautiful\nplace and the I mean the scenery just\nnext level and and I don't know if you\nstopped at the first aid station but it\nhad a fantastic view for you I did I\nwell I didn't stop but I did slow down\num because it was amazing and I did see\nthe uh you know the preview photo you\nknow leading up to the race you guys had\nsome uh social media posts or things\nalong those lines and I'm like that is\namazing you could probably see I don't\nknow you tell me 15 20 miles off in the\ndistance is beautiful yeah really\nbeautiful so it's so it's so wonderful\nthat we get to enjoy these beautiful\noutdoors and all these different\nservices and do it with people that just\nwant to have fun on their bikes and have\na good healthy competition so again Ian\nthank you so much for being part of that\num and uh yeah I I hope we get to see\neach other here on a race very soon yeah\nI look forward to it I definitely get to\nan event or two of your next year in\n2025 so thanks for all you're doing I\nknow it's a ton of work a lot of people\ndon't realize how much much time and\neffort goes into uh putting on events\nlet alone a whole series um so I know I\nknow you're doing a top top tier job and\nyou got a lot of good support so um\nthank you we appreciate it thank you\nappreciate appreciate you as well hey so\nwe'll uh we'll chat soon have a good\nnight Ian all right thanks Chris",
