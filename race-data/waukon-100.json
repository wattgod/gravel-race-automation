The community spirit peaks at church basement packet pickup and ends with unsupported riding after 2:00PM."

The 'friendly to new racers' positioning confirms this isn't attracting serious competition."

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "No registration fees listed, but two distance options, two aid stations, and post-race food suggests reasonable bang for buck in Iowa terms. You're paying for 4,300 feet of climbing over 100k, which delivers more vertical than most Midwest options. The value proposition works if you need climbing practice without traveling to real mountains."

      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Waukon, Iowa isn't exactly a destination requiring expensive hotels or flights to regional airports. The race date coordination with packet pickup the night before suggests local lodging exists and is accessible. No premium pricing pressure from prestige or demand — this is Midwest gravel racing where costs stay reasonable by necessity."

        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "100k (62 miles) hits the sweet spot for serious gravel distance without entering ultra territory.

Two distance options executed properly scores points even if the overall production doesn't."

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Iowa gravel with 4,300 feet of gain over 100k suggests more than flat farm roads, and locals warn that 'Allamakee county might surprise you.' Without surface breakdown data or technical feature details, you're gambling on unknown terrain. The climbing suggests at least moderate technical demands, but Iowa's reputation for smooth gravel keeps expectations in check."
      },
      "elevation": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "4,300 feet over 100k delivers legitimate climbing for the Midwest, described as 'a bit more climbing' than comparable series races. That's 70 feet per mile average, which creates real fatigue without requiring mountain bike gearing. For Iowa standards, this represents serious vertical — elsewhere, it's a warm-up."

        "explanation": "June 21st in Iowa brings heat, humidity, and potential thunderstorms with zero weather mitigation mentioned in race planning. No historical weather incidents documented suggests either perfect conditions every year or races too small for weather stories to matter. The 7:00AM start helps beat heat, but Iowa summer weather can turn ugly fast."

        "explanation": "This is Iowa — you're barely above sea level with zero altitude considerations. No starting elevation data provided because it doesn't matter for performance or acclimatization. The only elevation that counts here is the 4,300 feet you'll climb during the race, not where you start."

No airport, lodging, or parking information suggests you're expected to figure out small-town Iowa logistics yourself. The sweep ending at 2:00PM creates a hard cutoff that could strand unprepared riders miles from anywhere."

The promise that the terrain 'might surprise you' suggests hidden gems, but without route details or standout features documented, you're trusting local knowledge. Adventure here means discovering what Iowa can offer, not conquering legendary terrain."
