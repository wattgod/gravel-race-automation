Ham radio operators provide emergency communication through Siuslaw National Forest valleys."

At mile 16, riders can drop to the 32-mile Leif Erikson route described as \"less graveled\" with less climbing. The flexibility suggests the 53-mile main course isn't particularly demanding. More compact than Grinduro."
      },
      "technicality": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The course features \"terrain new to many riders with a thrilling twist that has seldom seen a bike tire on\" through Siuslaw National Forest backroads. Organizers require 35mm+ tires and recommend 38mm when wet for increased contact. The finish includes a \"tricky 3-mile descent\" that tests bike handling skills. Similar technical demands to Gravel Worlds."

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Starting from sea-level Yachats and climbing inland through forest terrain delivers substantial elevation change, with community reports mentioning 5000 feet total. The Leif Erikson route having \"less climbing\" confirms the Erik the Red loop packs enough vertical to matter over its 53 miles. Similar elevation profile to Gravel Worlds."

More weather exposure than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Starting at sea level in Yachats means zero altitude considerations. Even climbing inland through Siuslaw National Forest reaches modest Pacific Coast Range elevations. Respiratory challenges come from ocean humidity and effort, not thin air. Lower altitude than Gravel Worlds — no thin-air concerns."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The course delivers \"ocean waves and ribbons of gravel\" through Siuslaw National Forest on routes that have \"seldom seen a bike tire.\" Navigation warnings emphasize GPS devices and self-reliance through remote forest terrain. The transition from coastal Yachats to inland backcountry creates diverse exploration opportunities."
      },
      "prestige": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "West Coast Gravel sits as \"Round #4 of the Oregon Triple Crown,\" a regional series with limited reach beyond Pacific Northwest gravel circles. No notable pro presence or national coverage elevates the event beyond local weekend warrior racing."

        "score": 2,

Packet pickup ends at 8:30 AM for a 9:00 AM start, giving you 30 minutes to figure out mechanical issues. That's not race organization, that's wing-it-and-pray. As Post-Race Celebration puts it: \"Custom Medals for all 11 divisions awarded starting at 1:pm and 1:30 pm. Live Music onsite and food vendors to use your 14.00 food voucher.\""

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Viking-themed route naming (Erik the Red, Leif Erikson) celebrates \"the explorer in all of us\" through remote forest terrain. Most riders combine this with Oregon Coast Gravel Epic the previous day for a weekend doubleheader, though that creates fatigue considerations for Sunday's effort."

        "explanation": "Post-race features live music, $14 food vouchers for local vendors, and custom medals across 11 divisions. 10 Barrel Brewing provides beverages while Village Bean coffee shop opens at 7 AM for pre-race fuel. The weekend format builds camaraderie among riders tackling consecutive days."

        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Elite winner Austen Davis finished just eight minutes ahead of the men's 40-49 winner, suggesting limited competitive depth. The event draws primarily regional Oregon riders for the Triple Crown series rather than attracting deep national fields. Thinner field than Ouray Gravel Grinder."

      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Registration runs $75-95. Yachats offers affordable Oregon Coast lodging compared to destination resort towns. The small village setting means reasonable accommodation costs, and the two-day format lets riders split weekend expenses across multiple events. Local food vouchers stretch post-race dining dollars. Similar expense level to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

          "transcript": "Holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Holy\n[&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\nWhoa. Almost\ndied. All right. It is the morning\nof the West Coast\ngravel race here in Yahhatz. And uh in\ncase you can't tell by the bags under my\neyes or the fact that my voice\nis not even close to awake, uh Kora was\nup last night all night.\nUh, I don't know what happened, but\nuh, I'm legit I'm legitimately going on\nmaybe a couple hours of sleep in the\nlast 24 hours. You know that like drunk\nsort of drunk feeling you get when you\nhaven't slept and it's just kind of\nwoozy and like everything's kind of\nwobbling? Uh, that's where I'm at this\nmorning. So, I've got to somehow find a\nway to get enough energy to bang out a\n35 mile gravel race. I got my\nnumber, got all my\nstuff. I'm going to go find some coffee\nand hopefully figure this out. Oh man,\nhow's that coffee? It's really\ngood. It's terrible. It's actually not\ngood at all. But\nSo, I had this super cool idea to make\nthese little rice cakes the other day\nthat all this nutrition in them. They're\nlike perfect. 150 calories a bar. It's\ngonna be perfect. I was going to eat the\nwhole time. And then we got to the coast\nand I forgot them. So instead, I am\ngoing to be eating\nSkittles, gummy bears, uh, and a\nbanana. So, I haven't slept. I forgot my\nfood. I'm eating\ncandy. Should be good. And then each of\nthese bottles has about 150 calories of\nuh Gatorade powder.\nThis is going to be\ngood. Everything's going to be fine. How\nyou doing, Cora? Which socks should I\nwear today? Come here.\nShark socks. Yeah, that's what I should\nwear. Shark socks.\nSo,\nYou want some gummy bears, too? It's a\nlittle early in the morning for gummy\nbears. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\nYeah. Itty bitty bowl. Yum. Yum. Yum.\nYum. Yum. Maybe ask your mom. Mom.\nSo, the gummy bears have 44 gram of\ncarbs and these Skittles have 56.\nThat's a pretty easy number. That's 100\ngrams of carbs. So, I just got to eat\nall of\nthis in the in an\nhour. That's so much\ncandy. That's\ncrazy.\nSugar color sunglasses should I wear\ntoday? The that bit up. No, not\nclear. Should I wear yellow or should I\nwear blue? Yellow. Yellow. Okay, we can\ndo it. I'll put in yellow. Do they make\nthese an extra extra large? They do.\nWow. It's a miracle.\nOh, I'm going to crush all of my PRs.\nFirst of all, thank you for coming to\nYahhat. Let's give the community of Yah\na big\nuh we're welcoming all our cyclist\ncycling junkies here to the gem of the\nOregon coast. All of you at 2.8 miles\nfrom here have to make that left-hand\ndeath turn. It's a 55 with a corner. The\ntraffic's coming at you is on the KP\nturnoff. It's not even marked. Um in\nyears past, I'm assuming they're there\ntoday. Yahhat's fire department's going\nto be at the coff over there in case any\nof you guys decides to be a hood\nornament. Oh my god. You just\nclimb and\nclimb and climb.\nOh my\ngod. Pretty though.\nJordan this way. Short course. Short\ncourse.\nHoly\n[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Holy\nWhoa. Almost died.\nOh, this is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\nDid you see that? Giant\npotholes. I didn't think that was ever\ngoing to\nend. I am\nhammered. Some days just aren't it,\nman. But, you\nknow,\nfinished. Now it's like four miles back\nto town.\nYears young. 24336 from Thirsty Bear\nCycling. Come on up here.\nAnd your champion with an attack late in\nthe game. Austin Davis from the\nadventure squad. 24239.\nAt least you're listening. That makes me\nfeel a little better.\nDid my best to eat all the Skittles and\ngummy bears. I got through most of the\ngummy bears. A lot of Skittles left,\ndudes.\nWell, just a lot of candy to eat in 2\nhours.\nOkay, ready to flip it.\nGood smashing. Ready.\nYeah. Do you want to put the seashell on\ntop?\nOkay.\nGood job.\nHey, Cory, are you having a good time so\nfar? Yeah. Yeah. What's your favorite\npart of the weekend?\nMama, your favorite part is getting\ncoffees with mama. Yeah. Yeah. Are you\nexcited to go to the aquarium today?\nYeah. Yeah. What are you gonna see?\nAnimals. Animals. We're gonna see seals.\nAre you gonna see sharks?\nHi. It's\nCora.\nHi. West Coast Gravel 2025.\nI don't know how else to explain it\nother than brutal. Just just a brutal\nrace from the beginning forgetting my\nnutrition to not getting any sleep the\nnight before to expecting smoother roads\nthan last year's and being proven wrong\nquite quickly. West Coast Gravel was a\ntough one for me this year. I somehow\nPRED, which is nice. I beat my time last\nyear\nby sixish minutes, which I'm happy with.\nI got fifth in my class, which I'm\nslightly disappointed with. I I really\nwould have liked to have podium over the\nweekend. I was about 10 minutes off of\nthird place. And there was a climb that\nI was actually 6 minutes slower on this\nyear than last year. So, had I have\nimproved on that\nclimb, had a little bit better of a\ndescent for the majority of it, I may\nhave gotten there. So, we're close.\nMaybe if I had slept a little bit, that\nactually may have helped, but\nwhatever. But all in all, a great\nweekend. Got to hang out with Beth and\nCora at the coast. Yahhat is a beautiful\ntown. I always love visiting Yahhats.\nGot to see Hedah Head Lighthouse.\nrode our bikes up to Cape\nPerpetual, played in the sand, flew a\nkite, looted some tide pools, went to\nthe Newport Aquarium, the Oregon Coast\nAquarium in Newport, I should\nsay. So, while the race may not have\nplayed out exactly as I wanted it to,\nyou really can't complain about a\nweekend like that. It\nreally, it just really doesn't get much\nbetter. And that's one really cool thing\nabout these races that they force you\nout of the house. They make you go to\nplaces that you don't usually go. And\ndespite the race results, as long as you\nhave a good time, that's what really\nmatters. I am getting ready for the next\nrace, which is in about 7 weeks to Kelma\nGravel Grinder down near Roseber,\nOregon. And that is a big ride. That is\ngoing to be 57\nmiles, 6700 ft of climbing if I remember\nright. And I am uh I'm a little nervous\nabout that one. That's going to be\nThat's going to be a four or five hour\nadventure. So, getting myself mentally\nprepared for that. And uh in the\nmeantime, just gonna enjoy the ride.\nEnjoy being on the bike. Taking this\nweek off for the most part. Just going\nto ride around with Kora real easy.\nNothing\ncrazy. And\nuh on to the next adventure.",

          "transcript": "So, good morning. Welcome to uh day two\nof the Walport Yah weekend.\nUm so, today we're in Yahhatas. We're at\nthe\num community center, the park. This is\nLahi Dah Lane or something like that.\nAnd uh we're getting ready for the start\nof the second race.\nUm the racers meeting is in about 15\nminutes or so and then it's a slow ride\ndown the coast a little bit until the\nstart. So um it's time to get ready and\ntime to ride. I've already checked in.\nAlready got my\nnumber. Said hello to a bunch of friends\nand the girls got to run around in the\npark with some other little pups. And uh\nit's time to get ready to go. Okay,\nwe'll see you at the start.\nIt's all right, here we\ngo. This start is a little different.\nwhere we roll out to a remote start\nand we all start from there.\nDisqualified start.\nSo because of that\num I'm using the roll out to the remote\nstart as the warm up. Heat. Heat.\nThe route starts out in Yahhatz and\nheads south down Highway 101 before\nturning inland to where we all gather\nfor remote start. Right off the bat,\nyou're on to the main climb of the day,\na total of almost 1,900 ft over the\nfirst 10 miles or so. From there, it's a\nlong and mainly downhill gravel ride\ndown to Yahhatas River Road and a flat\npaved 9 miles or so to the end of the\ntime section. From there, it's another\nmile and a half back to\nYahhatz. Okay, here we go.\nSo much for a warmup, right? It was a\nwarmup cool down event\nlike the day before. Technically, it was\na timed event, not a real race. Your\nfinal position is based on your time,\nnot what place you cross the finish\nline. There's a sensor on your bike that\nstarts timing when you cross a sensor on\nthe road and stops timing when you cross\nanother one at the finish line.\nAnd here we go. Okay. Go faster. Going\nthe same speed. Now we're racing. Now\nI'm racing. Yeah.\nSuddenly going the same speed. Yeah.\n[Music]\nI rode for a little while with my friend\nStan, who is part of team K9 Crack. His\nwife Georgie makes and markets some dog\ntreats called K9 Crack. My girls love\nthem and they highly recommend them.\nI'll put a link to K9 Crack in the\ndescription\nbelow. All right, Stan, we'll see you at\nthe finish.\nWe'll see about that.\nAre you doing the long course? I am.\nYeah. A long day.\nNo, really.\nNo, it was 11.\nYeah. I use my uh my girls as an excuse.\nI don't want them to be waiting in the\ncar that long. Yeah.\nIt's a good excuse.\nThere were about 200 racers who started\nthe day and by the time we were a couple\nof miles into the first climb, we were\nall strung out across the mountain side.\nIt was a gorgeous morning and the\nscenery made the relentless climb just a\nlittle bit more pleasant.\nAfter the first climb, it was kind of up\nand down until the second aid station,\nbut primarily climbing. After the second\naid station, the course turned more\ndownhill\nand most of the climbing was behind us.\nup and down.\nAnd then it was down onto Yahhat's River\nRoad and fighting a not particularly\nnice and somewhat stiff headwind for the\nlast several miles to the finish.\nAll\nright.\nWell, made it. That was hard.\nUm, I think I beat the time I wanted to\nbeat by like seven minutes, which is\ngood. So, I came in fifth overall in my\nage group, which is still pretty good.\nIt's still not bad. I beat the uh time I\nwanted to beat.\nSo, that's it. That's it for a a\nuh two- wheeled weekend in Waldport Nah.\nIt was a gravel race weekend and it was\na lot of fun. Uh now it's time to go\ncheck out put on some clean clothes. I'm\ncovered with sweat and snot\nand\nsticky food. You can call gels and\ngummies food.\nBut it's time to uh clean up and go\ncheck out the uh the festivities and see\nwhat's going\non. Okay. Well, thanks for joining me\nfor another Two Wheel Wednesdays and I\nhope you enjoyed the ride. I sure did.\nAnd uh you know, it doesn't matter if\nyou race or not. It doesn't matter if\nyou ride a gravel bike or mountain bike\nor road bike as long as it's fresh air\nsunshine. And uh always remember, life\nis twice as good on two\nwheels. And we'll see you in the next\none.",

          "transcript": "[Music]\nall right\nhi hey there welcome to another two\nwheeled Wednesday\ntoday we're up in yah Oregon and uh\nwe're going to go for a gravel ride you\nbet you know every year in the first\nweekend of May there are two gravel\nraces uh up here on Oregon Central Coast\nthe first is the Oregon coast gravel\nepic and that's held in walport which is\nlike 6 or 8 miles north of here and\nthat's on Saturday and then on the next\nday Sunday is the West Coast Coast\ngravel I don't think they call it epic I\nthink they just call it the West Coast\ngravel um and that starts and finishes\nhere at yahad and I think it starts and\nfinishes right at this park here this is\nla dah Lane in that City Hall that's the\nlittle skate\npark and uh we're going to go for a ride\non the the Sunday course today here's a\nmap of today's adventure we start out\nhere in beautiful downtown yahs and head\nsouth on US Highway One 1 through town\nafter about 3 miles we turn East onto US\nForest Service Road\n55 and start climbing we take Forest\nService 55 for about 11 miles before\nturning on to us Forest Service\n5800 after somewhere around 6 miles on\n58 we catch yah's River Road and head\nWest we follow the aot river back to\ntown and our finish this is the shorter\nof the two routes for the West Coast\ngravel race all in all we ride just\nunder 34 miles and with stops spend a\nlittle more than 4 hours on two wheels\nwith a total of more than 3,800 ft of\nclimbing thanks again to relive for the\nmap well I think we found a good route\nto take good and it's a beautiful day\nwell it shouldn't be so windy up there\nbut who knows who knows might be\nwindier I have a good one you\ntoo all right\nwell um we just got some local advice\none of the gentleman that lives here out\nwalking his dog and he says it's a\nbeautiful route\nso ready to go I'm ready Let's\nRide\nfor\nI could smell\nbarbecue smell smells really\ngood yeah this is a gorgeous stretch of\nhighway but it's a little bit\nnarrow not a lot of room for\nbikes and I'm sure people are going to\nbe looking at the spectacular scenery\ninstead of looking out for\nme and garment\nsays this is the first climb of the\nday about a mile and a\nhalf and uh it's into a\nheadwind a cold\nheadwind how well life is still twice as\ngood on two\nwheels onward\nupward\nso this is Cape\nperpetua I think it's like the tallest\nmountain on the Oregon\ncoast thankfully we're not going up and\nover\nit\nokay up we go here's the start of the\nnext climb\nat least we're off\n101 according to\nGarmin um we\nclimb about 11 miles 10.9\nsomething and climb about 2400\nft that's not too\nbad I'm probably going to have to\nrearrange some\nlayers and voila there we\ngo yeah the jacket was a little too\nwarm but this might be a little\nchilly but I'll warm up on the way up\nthe key to good layer\nlayering is to resist the temptation to\nfill up the pockets of every layer you\nknow it's like a I got pockets I can\nthrow that in there yeah let's bring\nthis extra Cliff bar you\nknow um because when you shut a\nlayer not only do you have to find out\nwhere that you know figure out what\nyou're going to do with that layer but\nyou also have to do something with all\nthe stuff that was in that layer's\nPockets\nso that's just chips tip for for now I'm\nsure I'll have plenty\nmore but it looks like the road goes up\nalong the\nacross the face of that Ridge and then\naround maybe back the other\nside I don't\nknow it's plenty steep\nthough\nit's nice up here it's\nbeautiful I love this time of year in\nthe angle of the\nsun all right I better pay\nattention\nokay still climbing again and it seems\nthat after the initial long climb it's\nbeen kind of up and down where you gain\na couple hundred then lose a 100 gain a\ncouple hundred and lose a couple\nhundred and the net effect is going up\nbut at least you get a little break\nevery once in a\nwhile\nthere's a Punchy little section\nhere oh it's only\n12% huh I must be getting\nold\nokay left I\nsuppose\n5500 yeah that's us\nokay\nwell clingy\nGarin this is the top of the\nclimb\nnext\nclimb 5\nmiles so I got a 5 Mile\ndownhill which means I should probably\npull over grab something to eat get\nsomething to\ndrink and uh cover up a little\nbit\nthe\nit's nice\nRoad nice\nsurface really pretty\ntoo I get a stiff neck in those\ndownhills I guess I got to relax a\nlittle bit\nmore\nI think this is my\nturn I\nthink this is\nit I hope\nso I don't want to come back up\nthis\nI'm getting tired of\nclimbing\nwhoa\nI think that's\nit I\nthink I think it's just Highway home\nnow that was pretty nice\nthat was pretty\nnice okay\nso in addition to just checking out the\nroute um there are a couple questions I\nwanted to answered the first is if I'd\nbe able to do two of these in a week\nthe uh walport race the Saturday race\nlooks like it's got just as much\nclimbing and at race Pace that could be\npretty demanding and I don't know if I\ncould do it two days in a row I gu guess\nwe'll make that decision tomorrow when I\ntry and get out of bed and the second is\nif I do do the race both races what size\nwheels and tires do I go with with the\ntaller skinnier\nones which are faster on the climbs and\nflats or do I go with the shorter wider\nones\nwhich give me\num more traction in the gravel on the\ndownhills in the\ncorners\nI think I think that's going to be like\nwhat they say in football as a game time\ndecision\nbut I'm on the shorter fatter tires\ntoday and I'm glad I was on some of\nthose\ndownhills and I didn't feel like it was\nslowing me down going\nuphill\nso I'm leaning\ntowards the\n650s with some t wider\ntires okay that's it it's been a\nwonderful day almost almost back to\nyahad and life is twice as good on two\nwheels don't let anybody tell you\ndifferent\nand here we are back in yats\nit's\nall right well that was\nfun that was quite the\nworkout awfully Scenic\nthough I hope you're enjoying riding\nalong with me on these two- wheel\nWednesday\nAdventures if you are please hit the\nSubscribe button it helps a lot you can\nalso follow me on Facebook Instagram Tik\nTock and\nstraa so this has been quite the uh\neducational\nexperience I really like it um you know\none of I'm putting together the 2024\ncalendar like I said earlier like last\nweek and the week before and that was\npart of what this ride was about was\nchecking to see if I liked it and I\nreally did I don't know if I could do it\ntwo days in a row we'll find out\ntomorrow when I'm trying to get out of\nbed but\nI definitely like this I like yahs a lot\ntoo it's a cool little\ntown so I guess that's it for this week\nuntil next week remember life is twice\nas good on two wheels and we'll see you\nweek",

The main challenge is a relentless 1,900-foot climb over the first 10 miles that strings riders across the mountainside. A dangerous left turn at mile 2.8 onto Forest Service Road 55 requires caution due to traffic, with fire department stationed for safety. After the initial climb, the course follows an up-and-down pattern gaining and losing elevation until the second aid station, then transitions to primarily downhill. The route includes Forest Service roads with giant potholes before finishing on Yachats River Road, where riders face a stiff headwind for the final flat paved miles. About 200 racers typically start this timed event, which uses sensors rather than finish line placement for results. The scenic Oregon coast setting provides beautiful views despite the challenging terrain and weather conditions."
