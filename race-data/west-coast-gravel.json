The course traverses a \"high-traffic 55MPH zone on Yachats River Rd\" with no traffic control, prompting organizers to recommend taillights. Ham radio operators provide emergency communication through Siuslaw National Forest valleys."

        "explanation": "Elite winner Austen Davis finished Erik the Red in 2:42:39, while the short course winner clocked 1:38:21. At mile 16, riders can drop to the 32-mile Leif Erikson route described as \"less graveled\" with less climbing. The flexibility suggests the 53-mile main course isn't particularly demanding. More compact than Grinduro."
      },
      "technicality": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The course features \"terrain new to many riders with a thrilling twist that has seldom seen a bike tire on\" through Siuslaw National Forest backroads. Organizers require 35mm+ tires and recommend 38mm when wet for increased contact. The finish includes a \"tricky 3-mile descent\" that tests bike handling skills. Similar technical demands to Gravel Worlds."
      },
      "elevation": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Starting from sea-level Yachats and climbing inland through forest terrain delivers substantial elevation change, with community reports mentioning 5000 feet total. The Leif Erikson route having \"less climbing\" confirms the Erik the Red loop packs enough vertical to matter over its 53 miles. Similar elevation profile to Gravel Worlds."
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Organizers report \"great weather 75% of the time\" over the past decade, but warn \"Always bring good rain gear when visiting the Oregon Coast!\" The 2025 edition was described as \"A beautiful day for a gravel race,\" though Pacific Northwest May weather remains unpredictable. More weather exposure than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Starting at sea level in Yachats means zero altitude considerations. Even climbing inland through Siuslaw National Forest reaches modest Pacific Coast Range elevations. Respiratory challenges come from ocean humidity and effort, not thin air. Lower altitude than Gravel Worlds — no thin-air concerns."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The course delivers \"ocean waves and ribbons of gravel\" through Siuslaw National Forest on routes that have \"seldom seen a bike tire.\" Navigation warnings emphasize GPS devices and self-reliance through remote forest terrain. The transition from coastal Yachats to inland backcountry creates diverse exploration opportunities."
      },
      "prestige": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "West Coast Gravel sits as \"Round #4 of the Oregon Triple Crown,\" a regional series with limited reach beyond Pacific Northwest gravel circles. No notable pro presence or national coverage elevates the event beyond local weekend warrior racing."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The race website can't even nail down basic details—they list 53 miles officially but can't provide elevation gain, aid station locations, or cutoff times. Packet pickup ends at 8:30 AM for a 9:00 AM start, giving you 30 minutes to figure out mechanical issues. That's not race organization, that's wing-it-and-pray. As Post-Race Celebration puts it: \"Custom Medals for all 11 divisions awarded starting at 1:pm and 1:30 pm. Live Music onsite and food vendors to use your 14.00 food voucher.\""
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Viking-themed route naming (Erik the Red, Leif Erikson) celebrates \"the explorer in all of us\" through remote forest terrain. Most riders combine this with Oregon Coast Gravel Epic the previous day for a weekend doubleheader, though that creates fatigue considerations for Sunday's effort."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Post-race features live music, $14 food vouchers for local vendors, and custom medals across 11 divisions. 10 Barrel Brewing provides beverages while Village Bean coffee shop opens at 7 AM for pre-race fuel. The weekend format builds camaraderie among riders tackling consecutive days."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Elite winner Austen Davis finished just eight minutes ahead of the men's 40-49 winner, suggesting limited competitive depth. The event draws primarily regional Oregon riders for the Triple Crown series rather than attracting deep national fields. Thinner field than Ouray Gravel Grinder."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The package includes custom medals, $14 food vouchers, fully stocked aid stations with Hammer Nutrition products, and drop bag service. Combining with Saturday's Oregon Coast Gravel Epic creates weekend value for riders wanting consecutive gravel challenges."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Registration runs $75-95. Yachats offers affordable Oregon Coast lodging compared to destination resort towns. The small village setting means reasonable accommodation costs, and the two-day format lets riders split weekend expenses across multiple events. Local food vouchers stretch post-race dining dollars. Similar expense level to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."
