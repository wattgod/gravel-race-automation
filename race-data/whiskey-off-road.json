Past races have seen 102F Garmin readings on exposed climbs and heat exhaustion incidents, while other years brought freezing rain, hail, and mountain-top snow. The altitude creates 20-30F temperature swings from start to high points. Pack for all seasons."

      "altitude": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Start elevation is 5,400ft with max altitude at 7,011ft. Meaningful enough to affect sea-level athletes—cramping is endemic, and the thin air compounds the Skull Valley suffering. Not extreme like Leadville or Crusher, but altitude is a factor, especially late in the race."

Even Payson McElveen admits he cramps 75% of Whiskey races. Past riders have documented heat exhaustion, knife-like cramps that drop them trailside, and complete mental breakdown.

      "expectation_reset": "Respect Skull Valley. Don't go out too hard. Hydrate aggressively for days before the race. Bring more electrolytes than you think you need.
