Here we go.\nNow we're off the road section. Engage\nmy suspension.\nHere we go.\nTop of the climb. Little bit out of\nbreath,\nbut we're at the windy side.\nSome single track.\nHeat.\nWhat?\nNot having\nIt's okay. No worries. No, no, no\nworries. Early in the day.\nSure. Okay. Thank you.\nVery narrow trail, very rocky. I uh\ndon't think this has been getting a huge\namount of traffic. So, we just came back\nin where Moby joins back into 48.\nback when you get a chance.

Traffic both directions.\nSo you got to be pretty careful the line\nyou take.\nObviously the fast guys are back up the\nhill.\nNow\nhe's here just getting down to the\nturnound.\ndown here at the turnaround is really\nwhere\nI think the race starts\nbecause\nthis climb back up here. We're a/4 mile\nout from the turn and then you just\nclimb. And you're climbing uh for quite\na long way\nback up past\nwhere we made the junction right up to\nthe top of the hill\nbefore you get any reprieve. So in\nreality, it's about a hour long climb\nfor me.\nAnd here it is. There's the turnar\naround.\nWell, add that chair. Gotcha.\nGets its own high viz.\nAnd here we go. Back up the hill. Looks\nforward to an hour of climbing and heavy\nbreathing. And I won't bore you with\nthat.\nSo, we're coming up on the split. 30 is\ngoing one way. 50 is going over the top.\nSo,\nhang on, buddy. Hang on. Hang on. Hang\non.\nYeah. Yeah. Yeah.\nNow off the top of the hill, you get a\nlittle bit more downhill.\nIt's fire road, but\nstill fun. Bumpy\nbumpy.

The Whiskey Off Road is 3-day (Friday-Sunday) mountain bike event and race held each spring here in Prescott, Arizona. There are 15-, 25-, and 50-mile (proof) options. The 15-proof (closer to 20 miles) fun ride is held on Friday. I have never raced the 15-proof, although I have raced the 50-proof and 30-proof a handful of times. For those that have asked; here you go. Have a safe and fun race. Good luck! And . .\nHave a great ride. -- goMTB prescottAZ.\n\n*NOTE: I knew I was going to have to do one camera battery swap for this ride. I deliberately chose to do this early at the Aspen Creek aid location prior to the start of the singletrack. The result is uninterrupted footage of all the singletrack to the end. \n\n*TIP: There are a few places that may hang up a rider if they’ve never ridden this course before:\nTrail 393  -    46:50\nTrail 327  -    50:48\nTrail 321  - 1:01:42\n\n*HISTORY NOTE: Trail(s) 327 and 393 were part of the earliest versions of the Whiskey Off Road course going back to 2004.

          "transcript": "foreign\ntime to get loaded up we're gonna head\nout to Prescott to go stay with my\nwife's mom so we can get ready for the\nwhiskey 50. set up the truck let's do it\n[Music]\n[Applause]\nthis 50 mile race has just shy of 7 000\nfeet of climbing and I'm feeling a mix\nof nerves and adrenaline\nwe're starting in the historic Whiskey\nRow here in Prescott Arizona and the\nenergy here is off the charts\nthis is the 18th annual event and it's\namazing to see how many people from all\nover came together for this\nI can't wait to see what the trails have\nin store for us and I've heard that the\nterrain is super challenging but I'm\nready to give it my all\nwhat's up\nsee another dude that costume makes me\nhot\nall right four miles in\nhitting dirt for the first time\noh boy\nheart rate was out of control at the\nbeginning\nlike always\nhell you gotta work on fixing that\nlet's go\nlet's eat you need to eat\nthank you\nelevation sucks\nthis is worse than Grizzly for some\nreason\noh Jesus hidden Rock\nI began the race with high hopes and\nconfidence relying on my trusty Garmin\nwatch to gauge my Readiness for the\nchallenge ahead however fate had other\noptions and my two and a half year old\nchild decided that the Night Before the\nRace was the perfect time to rebel\nagainst sleep\nas a result my well-prepared state was\nsabotaged and I found myself in a state\nof low Readiness and D training despite\nthe setback I was determined to give it\nmy all and push through the physical and\nmental obstacles that lay ahead\nthough it would be a difficult journey I\nknew that I had the grit and\ndetermination to prepare severe and\nreach the\ndownhill\ndidn't look forward to this\nI was quite like riding blind\nall right trp breaks don't tell me now\nin addition to the sleep deprivation the\naltitude of the race posed a significant\nchallenge for me the starting point was\nsituated at an elevation of\napproximately 5300 feet with the highest\npoint of the race reaching 7 000 feet\nthis unfamiliar terrain took a toll on\nmy body particularly at the start of the\nrace\nduring the initial two hours I struggled\nwith a high heart rate that drained most\nmy energy\nthat sucks\nsteamery's not bad\ncome on\nI know it's\nwhoa\nassistant\neither\nright now I'm not doing too bad\nthat was uh\ntough\nnow we're coming into\nafter we get down Skull Valley\nand how do you come back up\nJoy\noh you good Dan\nyou all good\nare you okay yeah we're good\nah\na\noh my God\nall right so down the last education I\nthink\nI thought\nokay\nbetter than I did before for sure\nuh\noh that was scary\noh\nat the outset of the race I encountered\na challenge in getting proper substance\na challenge in getting proper nutrition\ndue to limited opportunities to consume\nenergy gels or chews although I had a\nbottle of scratch super fuel that\nprovided essential calories and carbs\nit proved challenging to even access\nthat bottle while on the move\nthe design of the race course offered\nlimited spots where I could safely reach\ndown and grab the bottle making it\ndifficult to fuel up during the early\nstages of the race\nI ended up consuming one bottle of\nscratch super fuel seven energy gels two\npacks of shoes and four total bottles of\nwater and also a 80 ounce\nhydration pack with four scoops of\nscratch pineapple\nin total my intake amounted to about 424\ngrams of carbohydrates and 1 670\ncalories\nwhich provided me with the necessary\nfuel to sustain my performance\nthroughout the demanding racehorse\nah [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\nall right almost 38 miles in\nI am\nfound about half a bottle of water\nbecause I miscalculated\ngo figure\nall right\nI'm hoping there's no aid station\nexactly nice oh thank God\nwell I just got told I already did cramp\nHill\nI don't remember it\nwhatever talio\noh God\nI could fill up my water bottle again\nthat was a little concerning\na little bit of single track I mean\nreally climbing\nmy home free\nah damn gear ah\nnow it's so dry\njust can't keep it moist\nfor these two Racers coming up here they\ncome we got a danger Patrol\ntoo bad [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] coming up the\ntrail they look like they want some\ngolden tree\nat least he makes you faster I'm good\nhey\nsweet baby\nlet's do this let's get home\nson of a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\nbike is not happy\nlet's go find shade\nall right so the whiskey 50 was\nyesterday today is the day after the\nrace and I'm uh I'm hurt a little bit\nI'm definitely sore my chest definitely\nhurts a little bit I know that my upper\nbody strength isn't where it needs to be\nand that's something I'm gonna work on\nmaybe try to incorporate some strength\ntraining but overall the legs felt great\num I did have some issues\nthe Night Before the Race my\ntwo-year-old decided that he didn't want\nto sleep and\nmy sleep sucked the Night Before the\nRace and that made a big difference to\nhow I was able to perform\num\nthe elevation really got to me as well\nuh my heart rate was pinned a lot at the\nbeginning just because of the elevation\nand\nonce we hit Skull Valley the heat was\njust\nit was really hot I don't know how\naccurate the temperature sensors on the\nGarment are but my Garmin said 113 which\nI think is too high but it was\ndefinitely over a hundred\num it was hot I had to stop and take a\nbreak a couple times\njust to just to kind of cool down for a\nminute but overall I had such a fun time\nat this uh this event it was\nreally cool to do I've been wanting to\ndo this race for a long time and\nbeing able to finish was\nwas right there where I wanted to be\nyeah so overall I was able to finish the\nrace in six hours and 30 minutes which\nwas behind my my goal that I wanted to\ndo but given the lack of sleep the heat\nthe elevation\nI'm happy with it it's it's it's a\nrespectable time and I hope to do better\nnext year a huge thank you to all the\nsupporters and volunteers and the the\npolice department for the escorts and\nstuff like that that was really cool to\nbe able to ride right out of Whiskey Row\nand finish in Whiskey Row I really\nwanted to have a Sprint finish with\nsomebody at the end and I got to have\nthat so that was kind of a first and\nthat was really fun and\nI I beat him by quite a bit which was uh\nkind of surprising\num trainer Road has definitely been\nworking for me and I'm really thankful\nfor that it was really cool to be able\nto see uh Dan Bailey a wonderful\nphotographer based out of Alaska\num he's I've actually done some work\nwith him in the past and to be able to\nsee him again\nwas really cool towards the end of the\nride my bike was absolutely not happy\nsomething I want to do in the future is\nnot necessarily use a dry chain lube I\ndidn't expect there to be so many water\nCrossings uh after the first water\ncrossing basically all my chain loop was\ngone on my chain and that made a pretty\naudible difference right away uh I'll\nprobably switch over to something that's\nlike more of a wet Lube or maybe it's\njust squirt squirt has worked well in\nthe past",

Key challenges include the brutal Skull Valley climb, described as about an hour of sustained climbing after the turnaround point. Early in the race, riders face a route choice between Moby and 48 sections. The course offers limited opportunities for nutrition due to technical terrain that makes reaching bottles difficult. Riders note hidden rocks, narrow rocky trails, and the need for careful line selection on downhills with two-way traffic. The elevation significantly impacts performance, particularly in the first two hours. The race finishes with new single track sections and is known for its welcoming community atmosphere in the cowboy town of Prescott."
