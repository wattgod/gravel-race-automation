it's the Thursday night Cruiser\nride\nand this thing has been happening for\nover 20 years I've been doing it since\nmy sophomore year in college in\n1999. whoa that was a long time ago and\nmy life at times has revolved around\nThursdays when I'm in Boulder I do not\nmiss this ride what is this ride it's\njust a casual fun goofy emphasis on\nGoofy and we don't go fast we definitely\ndon't wear spandex unless it's some sort\nof fabulous leotard or something and\nit's all about fun when I think of my\ncommunity my beloved Boulder the Cruiser\nride is one of my absolute favorite\nthings that happens in this town that's\nstill a little bit weird Boulder's\ngotten a little shiny but the cruiser\nside is still holding strong with its\nweirdness\nfootage the second video\nuploaded to my YouTube channel was back\nin July 2006 and it was the Thursday\nCruiser ride and not a whole lot has\nchanged\nso here we are riding down an alley\nhaving a great time on Pearl Street\nwe're cruising

they're essentially\nlike training wheels on your feet and\nthey stabilize the bike and allow you to\ngo from a stop to a start\nand make quick turns and since I can\nonly use one hand right now it's a lot\nmore balanced so this is\nattachment for your helmet our mission\nis to increase helmet use by making them\nmore awesome and letting people Express\nthemselves while wearing a helmet you go\nto my helmetflair.com or on Amazon cool\nthing is you can swap them out because\nthere's a magnet base you just stick it\non your helmet pop on whatever design\nyou want my man here has purple
