The 65-mile distance with neutralized start allows tactical racing without crushing weekend warriors. Elite riders can race hard while recreational cyclists enjoy the Western Colorado scenery over manageable distance. Similar distance to Crusher in the Tushar.

The 5,500 feet of climbing delivers substantial challenge through punchy Western Colorado terrain. Similar elevation profile to Gravel Worlds.

Jack Luke, coming from sea level, noted feeling 'my legs from Friday's ride, along with the altitude' during warmup. The Western Colorado high desert elevation affects performance without being debilitating for most riders accustomed to moderate altitude. Similar altitude considerations to Grinduro."

Mixed terrain through the Horse Mountain Range sounds promising, but when organizers can't nail down basic metrics, it screams small-time operation. At least they promise 'a little bit of everything,' which usually means mediocre everything."

Free camping at High Lonesome Ranch eliminates major lodging costs, while De Beque's location 25 miles from Grand Junction provides regional airport access. On-site food trucks and ranch facilities keep meal costs reasonable. JOM noted extensive hospitality including winery visits and coffee shop stops during media rides, suggesting organizers work to control participant expenses beyond entry fees. Similar expense level to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."
