      "elevation": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The 2500m elevation gain over 130km creates consistent climbing through rolling Causses plateaus between 700-800m altitude. Elite fields narrow to five riders by the military camp section, suggesting the accumulated elevation separates contenders from the field effectively."
      },

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The 2025 edition started under rainy conditions but sun emerged quickly, while 2024 saw nearly 900 riders complete without weather disruptions. Mid-June in Aveyron typically delivers cooperative conditions for the exposed plateau sections and forest tracks."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Starting at 490m in Millau with course majority between 700-800m elevation keeps altitude impacts minimal. The Causses plateaus provide scenic elevation without affecting performance for most riders coming from sea level or moderate elevations."

      "adventure": {
        "score": 3,

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "UCI Gravel World Series qualification draws elite talent, with Axelle Dubau Prevot calling her win \"a dream come true\" representing France.

      "experience": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Finishing under the world's tallest cable-stayed bridge (336.4m) creates memorable theater above Millau.

      "field_depth": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Elite races finish with sprint from five riders (men) or commanding solo victories by 6 minutes (women), suggesting limited depth beyond top contenders. French domestic talent dominates podiums, with international participation growing but not yet creating deep competitive fields throughout categories."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "UCI World Championships qualification (top 25% of category plus top 3 finishers) adds tangible value for serious racers. Access to restricted military camp terrain and UNESCO world heritage landscapes through multiple distance options provides strong experience-to-cost ratio for European gravel racing."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "International travel requires flights plus 75-208km drives from nearest airports with rental car necessity for rural Aveyron access. June peak season accommodation costs in tourism-dependent region add expense, though no specific lodging partnerships or shuttle services reduce logistical burden."
