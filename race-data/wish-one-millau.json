Toby Perry launched his winning attack at 59.5km to go in 2023, finishing solo in 4:34:43, while 2024 saw sprint finishes with top contenders matching times at 4:25:26.

Less technical than The Mid South."

      "elevation": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The 2000m elevation gain creates consistent selection pressure through rolling terrain. Race reports note \"another hard climb awaits between kilometers 30 and 40\" following the opening climb out of Millau valley, with the finish featuring a \"paved 2km climb\" under the viaduct that determines final positions in close races. Similar elevation profile to Gravel Worlds."

        "explanation": "Puncture rates suggest challenging surface conditions, with Rosa Kloser suffering double punctures at km 95 in 2023 and Noah Adhemard forced to DNF from similar mechanical issues. The Causses limestone terrain appears demanding on equipment, though no severe weather disruptions reported across recent editions. Similar climate challenges to SBT GRVL."

      "altitude": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Starting in Millau valley with course majority across Causses plateaus keeps altitude impacts minimal. The terrain rolls between moderate elevations without reaching performance-affecting heights, allowing riders from sea level backgrounds to compete without acclimatization concerns across the limestone landscape features. Modest altitude compared to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The exact route stays \"under wraps until twenty-four hours before the start due to it passing through a military zone,\" adding mystery to the Larzac military camp access. Racing through restricted terrain with \"exceptional tracks\" unavailable elsewhere delivers unique adventure value through protected Grands Causses landscapes."

      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Course design emphasizes speed with tactical opportunities, creating varied race outcomes from solo breakaways to sprint finishes. However, the demanding concentration requirements where \"zoning out is down right impossible\" during \"five plus hours in the saddle\" suggests organizational challenges in managing rider safety across technical terrain."
      },

      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Elite competitions show limited depth with large finishing gaps typical. Carolin Schiff won by 12+ minutes in 2023, while race reports note \"significant gaps between the following riders\" as standard. The field attracts quality leaders but lacks the depth for close racing throughout categories. Less competitive depth than Almanzo 100."
      },

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "UCI World Championships qualification through top 25% placement adds tangible competitive value for serious racers. The single-day 2025 format with multiple distance options (40km to 130km) accommodates different experience levels, while military camp access provides unique terrain unavailable elsewhere in European gravel racing."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Registration runs €60-100. International access requires flights to distant airports plus rental car necessity for rural Aveyron travel. June timing hits peak tourism season in the Millau region, increasing accommodation costs without race-specific lodging partnerships or shuttle services to reduce the logistical expense burden for visiting riders. Higher total cost than Badlands."
