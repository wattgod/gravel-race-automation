Less competitive depth than Almanzo 100."

        "explanation": "At $180 for Day 1 and $220 for both days, you get rider packs, T-shirts, sausage sizzle, live music, and access to a proper festival atmosphere. Early bird pricing and half-price for kids shows they're thinking about accessibility. Compare that to most gravel events where $180 gets you a water bottle and sunburn."

      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Registration runs $70-120 AUD. Entry fees remain reasonable with early bird pricing, and riders need \"a moderate level of fitness\" rather than expensive specialized equipment beyond a gravel bike. The event provides spares, CO2, and mechanical support for purchase onsite, keeping gear costs predictable for participants. Similar expense level to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."
