        "score": 2,

        "explanation": "The Dirt Dash series cultivates a 'big riding family' vibe with many repeat participants returning year after year. That's genuinely nice for those who want a social cycling weekend. But small field sizes and the touring format mean you're not joining any significant gravel racing community here."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Non-competitive reliability trial format means no racing field exists. Everyone rides at their own pace through Yorkshire with no timing or results, creating social ride atmosphere rather than competitive depth."

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "£95 includes GPX files, support vehicle, overnight camping, evening meal, breakfast, and professional route design through North York Moors. Described as 'riders come first' philosophy with quirky YHA start/finish location."

      "expenses": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "£95 entry (£5 Cycling UK member discount) plus travel to Whitby keeps costs moderate. Extensive mandatory kit list including tent, sleeping gear, lights, tools, and own bowl/mug for meals adds equipment requirements."
