# 114 GRAVEL RACE - RAW RESEARCH DUMP

## OFFICIAL DATA

**Race Dates**

The 114 Gravel Race is scheduled for **Saturday, March 28, 2026**[1][3]. There is a discrepancy in one source listing it as "Sunday, March 28, 2026"[2], but the official UCI and race website sources confirm Saturday[1][3].

**Registration Costs**

Entry fees for 2026 are tiered by registration period[4]:
- Early bird (December 6, 2025 – December 31, 2025): €50
- Standard (January 1, 2026 – February 28, 2026): €60
- Late registration (March 1, 2026 – March 23, 2026): €70

**Distance & Elevation**

There is conflicting information in the search results:
- Official UCI Gravel World Series source states **123 km with 864m elevation gain**[1]
- The race's official website (114gravelrace.com) states **137 km with 1,370m elevation gain**[4]

The discrepancy may reflect different course options or recent course modifications. The official race website's more recent figure of 137 km and 1,370m elevation should be considered authoritative.

The user's known information (70 miles ≈ 112.6 km, 4,000 ft ≈ 1,219m) falls between these figures but does not precisely match either official specification.
