# 3 STATE 3 MOUNTAIN CHALLENGE — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**The Cycling Addiction blogger [UNKNOWN]:** "I was turning the cranks over so slowly that I was barely able to keep the bike up right. I glanced over to one rider walking up and he was staring at me as if I was nuts and that I should get off the bike and walk up with him, but I quickly looked away from the defeated cyclist and kept a focus on the cheers from those on the other side of the road. No way was I going to give up now, but each pedal stroke was an immense struggle up this 20% to 22% road gradient for the last 500 yards." (https://thecyclingaddiction.blogspot.com/2008/05/3-state-3-mountain-challenge.html)

**The Cycling Addiction blogger [UNKNOWN]:** "Within the first few minutes traversing through the city streets of Chattanooga we were soaked, but thankfully the organizers had the intersections blocked for the cyclists. In that first number of miles as I passed people I could hear those talking about bailing out or how miserable they felt, but the only thing I could honestly think about what was ahead of me." (https://thecyclingaddiction.blogspot.com/2008/05/3-state-3-mountain-challenge.html)

**The Cycling Addiction blogger [UNKNOWN]:** "The picture that everyone had painted as an image was now a reality as we turned. As soon as I turned on the road my legs began to burn like crazy as the sun suddenly comes out and began baking down on my neck. The gradient didn't look all that steep, but with this climb located 80 miles into the ride I believe most cyclist like myself were becoming pretty fatigued."

**Pedal Wench [UNKNOWN]:** "I've done it twice - third attempt was rained out. It's a wonderful ride, great support, and really interesting route. The final climb up Burkhalter's Gap is legendary - but fun! One time I did it in the rain and the descent off the first mountain (Sandy something, maybe?) was really rough - people walking DOWN the hill, but if the weather is nice, it's glorious."

**indysteel [UNKNOWN]:** "It's a hard ride for flatlanders, but it's doable with decent training--which is often hard to get by the first week in May. Rain is often an issue that time of year, too. Descents in the rain are just not my cup of tea. In fact, the year we were down there, a friend of ours got in a accident when another rider's brakes failed on a descent." (http://forums.teamestrogen.com/showthread.php?t=51493)

**Velo Vol [UNKNOWN]:** "It was wet the first hour or so (start time delayed due to a thunderstorm), I consequently got cold. Then, the sun was out in time for extra heat when I scaled Burkhaulter Gap." (https://www.bikeforums.net/southeast/498360-what-were-your-best-rides-2008-a.html)

**Velo Vol [UNKNOWN]:** "2,000+ riders makes for a slow start. I don't think I got much above 10 mph until the 3rd mile. The first 40 miles is flatter than I remember it being. Oh, to have flat stretches like that around here. It's not often that I get to cruise at 20 mph or so for that long." (https://www.bikeforums.net/4381823-post47.html)

**Velo Vol [UNKNOWN]:** "Either my rear tire is too worn down, or that road up Sand Mountain is extra slippery when wet. Several times my wheel lost traction. The climb is bad enough as it is, I don't need to be wasting power." (https://www.bikeforums.net/4381823-post47.html)

**Velo Vol [UNKNOWN]:** "My evil side reared its ugly head--a got a kick out of seeing some of the flatlanders toil on the hills." (https://www.bikeforums.net/4381823-post47.html)

**Porter20 [UNKNOWN]:** "My goal for this year, I would really like to do the 3 mountain 3 state ride (as it looks really awesome)" (https://www.bikeforums.net/southeast/498360-what-were-your-best-rides-2008-a.html)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**The Cycling Addiction blogger [UNKNOWN]:** "I dropped to my lowest gear, which was a 28 that I loved having, but out of discomfort my hand kept hitting the shifter as if there was another lower gear available."

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**The Cycling Addiction blogger [UNKNOWN]:** "I kept thinking about what Gary had told me a ton of times. Do your own pace and don't use up too much too early.
