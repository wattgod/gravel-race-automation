**Notes on Research Gaps**: Known user info (65 miles/~105 km, 4,500 ft/~1,372 m, Winterberg/Aachen) partially mismatches results (e.g., 2026 distances 86-129 km, 2,000-3,000 m; location shift to Winterberg). Much data unavailable, likely due to early 2026 planning stage; official site 3rides.de referenced but limited details extracted[2][3]. No founder named.
