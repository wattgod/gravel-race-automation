# 6 HOURS OF SYLLAMO — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

No community race reports, forum discussions, or rider blog posts were found specifically about a cycling event called "6 Hours of Syllamo." Available sources reference running events organized by **Syllamo Events** in the same region, primarily the multi-day **Three Days of Syllamo** stage race and the **Cotter Bridge Ultra** timed running event. The cycling-specific edition appears to have very limited online coverage at this time.

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Syllamo Trail System:** The Syllamo Trails near Mountain View, Arkansas, are part of the Ozark National Forest and feature rugged, rocky singletrack through densely forested terrain. The trail system includes significant elevation changes with an average of 150-170 feet of gain per mile, reaching up to 200+ feet per mile in steeper sections. Elevations range from approximately 300 feet to 1,400 feet above sea level. (syllamo.com)

**Surface Conditions:** The trail network includes maintained singletrack, gravel roads, off-highway vehicle roads, and creek crossings. Conditions vary significantly with rainfall — creeks can be dry or deep and flowing depending on recent precipitation. The terrain is technically demanding with rocks, steep climbs, and sections where navigation requires attention despite course flagging. (syllamo.com)

**Course Variability:** Syllamo Events notes that courses change every year, meaning participants cannot rely on familiarity from previous editions. The event organizers advise participants to "be prepared for anything" given the rugged Ozark terrain. (syllamo.com)

## Weather Experienced

**March Conditions (Historical):** Running events held in March at the Syllamo Trails have reported temperatures topping out around 55 degrees Fahrenheit with cloud cover. The Ozark mountain region can experience rapid weather changes in early spring. (irunfar.com)

**Creek and Mud Conditions:** Creek crossings are a significant course feature, with water levels varying from dry to deep depending on recent rainfall. The rugged forest terrain retains moisture and can become muddy after rain events. (syllamo.com)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

No cycling-specific equipment recommendations are available from participants. The rugged, rocky terrain with creek crossings and steep grades suggests wider tires with aggressive tread would be beneficial. The significant elevation gain (estimated at approximately 5,000 feet over 50 miles based on the known course profile) and technical terrain favor mountain bike or gravel bike setups with low gearing.

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Timed Format:** The 6-hour format means riders must balance sustained effort with the technical demands of the course. Unlike point-to-point races, the timed format rewards consistent output and efficient navigation over the duration rather than pure speed to a finish line.

**Elevation Management:** With 150-170 feet of elevation gain per mile on average, pacing on climbs is critical. The steep, technical nature of the Ozark terrain means that going anaerobic on early climbs can lead to significant fatigue over the full 6-hour duration.

## DNF Risk Factors

**Navigation:** Course flagging is provided but the rugged forest terrain makes it easy to go off-course, potentially adding significant bonus miles. GPS navigation is strongly recommended. (syllamo.com)

**Mechanical Issues:** Rocky terrain and creek crossings create elevated risk of tire punctures and mechanical failures. The remote forest setting means self-sufficiency is important as support access may be limited on course.

**Time Management:** The timed format means riders who lose time to mechanicals or navigation errors cannot make up distance — the clock runs regardless.

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Event Organization:** Syllamo Events operates the race series in the Ozark National Forest region. The events use the Blanchard Springs area as a basecamp, offering free camping, hot showers, warm meals, and access to Sylamore Creek for post-race recovery soaks. (syllamo.com)

**Remote and Rugged Character:** The Mountain View, Arkansas, area and surrounding Ozark National Forest provide a remote, wilderness-focused race experience. The event attracts participants drawn to challenging backcountry terrain rather than large-field, festival-style gravel events.

**Multi-Discipline Heritage:** The Syllamo trail system hosts both running and cycling events, with the Three Days of Syllamo stage race (running) being the more established event in the series. The cycling component builds on the same trail infrastructure and organizational expertise. (syllamo.com)
