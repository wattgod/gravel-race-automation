# 66° SOUTH PYRÉNÉES — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**LA GRAN (110.2 km) Course Characteristics:**
The route features "108 checkpoints, 1,870 mD+, and a terrain that plays with your nerves between 1,600 and 2,000 m altitude." The course climbs steeply at km 7, heading towards forest, rocky ground, and singletracks. Mid-course provides brief respite through Capcir, Formiguères, and lac de Matemale, but "at km 50, it starts again strongly, and at km 88, you tackle your last hill." Described as "a route for the sturdy, those who ride with both head and determination."

**THE HIKE (20.7 km) Course Characteristics:**
Starting from Angles, the route goes "straight into the slope" with the first climb through forest trail up to 1,900 m altitude, followed by "a nice fast descent towards Lake Matemale." At km 14, there's "a second steep climb" with the return via "a playful single track in the underbrush, technical but smooth."

The overall terrain alternates between "forest trails, rocky paths and mountain roads," with routes peaking at 2,400 m altitude featuring "rocky trails and forest paths typical of the southwest." Key features include Scots pine forests around Formiguères station, and views of Lake Matemale and Lake Calvet.
