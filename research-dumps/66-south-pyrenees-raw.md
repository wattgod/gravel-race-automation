**Research notes**: User-provided info (65 miles/~105km, 5500ft/~1676m, Pyrénées France) roughly aligns with 110km/2134m courses but no exact match; primary event is UCI Gravel World Series qualifier in Les Angles, Pyrénées-Orientales. Separate road event exists. Limited details due to search results focusing on UCI calendars; no rider reports, history beyond 2021 road origins, or logistics found. Additional searches needed for gaps.
