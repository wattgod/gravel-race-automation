# ALBIA HOLY COW — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

The race explores Monroe County west of Albia, featuring Class B roads (maintained gravel county roads), grass-fed cattle pastures, river crossings, and a section along the Historic Mormon Trail. The route is described as "fairly hill" with "a lot of long descents and nice flats to help you recharge and get ready for the next Class B challenge" (https://www.bikeiowa.com/Event/16026/albia-holy-cow).

One rider's description captures the surprise factor: "When I first rode West out of Albia, I didn't know what to expect. I knew there were a number of Class B roads I wanted to travel along the way, but I didn't expect to meet acres of grass-fed cattle, beautiful views, river crossings, and even a short ride along the Historic Mormon Trail" (https://www.granfondoguide.com/Events/Index/10062/albia-holy-cow).

The course is characterized as "moderate terrain with rolling short steep hills or moderate, sustained climbs" (https://www.granfondoguide.com/Events/Index/10062/albia-holy-cow).

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Anonymous rider [UNKNOWN]:** Set a personal goal to complete the race in 4:30 and "came in just late of the goal" for what appears to be the longer distance (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnzANTYWAvk).

**Trevor Irwin [ELITE]:** "The 50km distance is right in his wheelhouse" — finished the 50km in 1:58:09, placing 3rd overall. This suggests elite riders can target sub-2-hour times for the 50km distance (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KP5DejIBa2E and https://www.gravel-results.com/race/20001).

Elite 100km finishing times cluster tightly: Mason Wilson finished in 3:17:56, with the top 9 finishers all within 3 minutes of each other (3:20:05-3:20:59), suggesting the front pack stays together for much of the race (https://www.gravel-results.com/race/20001).

Mid-pack 100km times range from approximately 3:43 to 5:03, with the final finisher at 5:22:43 (https://www.gravel-results.com/race/20001).

## Community Feel & Atmosphere
