# ALENTEJO GRAVEL — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Rosa Klöser [ELITE]:** "The race was basically mixed with age group men, the start was quite hilly and technical so I found myself in a group of 15-20 men already after 15km. I decided to use the race as good training and raced the men - in the end, I finished in the top 5 overall in the age group men and won women elite - not bad to round off the season! Good to get some speed in the legs, battle it out with the boys but will focus on battling the ladies separately in 2026."

**Daan Grosemans [ELITE]:** "Breakaway with two, gambled on my sprint after a fast race but unfortunately one guy was faster. Nevertheless time for a well deserved off-season and let's bring the hunger for victory towards 2026." (https://www.cyclingnews.com/races/uci-gravel-world-series-events-2025/alentejo-gravel/results/)

**Lukas Malezsewski [ELITE]:** "We came here to test ourselves on one of the toughest courses in the series and to secure a ticket to Nannup. The climbs never stopped and the technical sections made it a real gravel classic. I'm proud of the team and excited to represent at the world championships next year."
