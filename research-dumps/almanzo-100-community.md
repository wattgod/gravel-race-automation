# ALMANZO 100 — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Nicholas Garbis / Gerasimos G [COMPETITIVE]:** "Perhaps it's also useful to briefly share the 'Meteor Theory' that I apply in pretty much every event. It is a plan to go out hot, hotter than what can be sustained, and then slowly peel back — like the edges of a meteor burning off as it enters the Earth's atmosphere. Decreasing speed, increasing suffering the whole way, and hoping that the body only turns to ash as the finish line comes into sight. Sometimes the ashes end up on the side of the road, maybe sleeping. Most times it sorta works. Every time it hurts." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2021-spring-valley-almanzo-100-meteor-theory-vs-heat-wave-gravel-vs-skin/)

**Nicholas Garbis [COMPETITIVE]:** "The weather forecast was for low 90s and high winds. Definitely, a tough day to be on a bike for 6-10hrs. I think I heard later that 350 had registered and 150 had shown up for the event. Crazy hot weather, transition year, new name (third name in 3 years), etc." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2021-spring-valley-almanzo-100-meteor-theory-vs-heat-wave-gravel-vs-skin/)

**Brad Patty [COMPETITIVE]:** "I knew from previous long hard-surface rides that I could maintain around 200 watts average power for over 5 hours. I was also able to determine from prior Almanzo 100 races I should be able to average between 15 and 16 MPH... I had taken 25 minutes off of my finish time from 2014 and felt much better from mile 40 to the finish." (https://bikefixation.com/post/blog-15-almanzo-100-lessons-from-two-years-of-gravel-racing)

**Jesse Lindhorst [COMPETITIVE]:** "Flying down slopes was always a thrill until I realize that I was going 35 mph on two very thin tires with the high risk of hitting a loose patch of gravel, which would no doubt send me into an imminent doom. Fresh gravel began to seem quite similar to riding in snow, and I must say, I wasn't too fond of it." (https://jesselindhorst.tumblr.com/post/51076284551/the-almanzo-100-a-bike-race-in-spring-valley-that)

**Jesse Lindhorst [COMPETITIVE]:** "The Almanzo is an amazing event that anyone can conquer because it's not about pain or racing or anything like that. Whether you ride 60 miles and drop out or finish just within the twelve hour window with scuffed knees and bent handlebars, it's about getting on a bike and experiencing the journey." (https://jesselindhorst.tumblr.com/post/51076284551/the-almanzo-100-a-bike-race-in-spring-valley-that)

**Nicholas Garbis [COMPETITIVE]:** "There's hardly a better gravel route to be found -- natural beauty, grinding open spaces, epic climbs including the soul-breaking Oriole Road at mile 91." (https://gravelnewsnetwork.blogspot.com/2021/06/race-report-05jun2021-spring-valley.html)

**Nicholas Garbis [COMPETITIVE]:** "Preston, like most towns in the area, is on a river... The course follows the river into the valley in the covered coolness of the forest. Then there's a bridge and you roll in toward town. It's a familiar pattern that repeats itself dozens of times on the course: downhill, valley, river, bridge, then uphill, open rolling plateau of farmland, downhill, etc." (https://gravelnewsnetwork.blogspot.com/2021/06/race-report-05jun2021-spring-valley.html)

**JOM [COMPETITIVE]:** "Friday's pre-drive was more of the same, but in greater abundance. Beautiful rolling hills, areas of lush, green tree cover and exposed rock faces along some of the road cuttings... South Eastern Minnesota is more than just farmland." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2017-almanzo-100-the-granddaddy-of-all-gravel-races/)

**JOM [COMPETITIVE]:** "The term 'bucket list' is an over-used cliche'. I refuse to use those two words in a conversation. Rather, Almanzo has always been a must-do gravel race." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2017-almanzo-100-the-granddaddy-of-all-gravel-races/)

**High Plains Reader rider [COMPETITIVE]:** "Despite my youth and training, overconfidence and a lack of equipment (which I left sitting at home because I'd be 'fine') ultimately allowed the rain to defeat me in just twenty-three miles. It was a tough pill to swallow." (https://hpr1.com/index.php/arts-entertainment/outdoors/almanzo-100-wilderfest-bike-race-still-a-rookie/)

**Mike Riemer, Salsa Cycles Marketing Manager:** "Almanzo was the first gravel event to broadly expose the masses to that type of riding. It helped create a community of cyclists that wanted to go take on a reasonable challenge... For most folks Almanzo isn't really a race, it's a personal challenge." (https://craftedwords.com/portfolio/ride-at-the-heart-of-minnesotas-gravel-scene-stays-true-to-its-origins/)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Tire Choices:**

**JOM [COMPETITIVE]:** Swapped from Panaracer Gravelking Mud tyres to Panaracer Gravelking SK's in 700c x 35mm with brown sidewalls. Set pressures at 35psi front / 38psi rear for wet conditions. "I felt [the Mud tyres were] unnecessary on this course, even if rain did fall on race day." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2017-almanzo-100-the-granddaddy-of-all-gravel-races/)

**Nicholas Garbis [COMPETITIVE]:** Mentioned tire inflation at "precisely 38.7 (probably a bit too high)" in 2021 hot conditions. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2021-spring-valley-almanzo-100-meteor-theory-vs-heat-wave-gravel-vs-skin/)

**Road Surface Assessment:**

**JOM [COMPETITIVE]:** "The gravel roads themselves are very reminiscent of what we have in North Central Florida; a hard pack limestone base and smattering of gravel atop, with a good mix of sandy bits thrown in... Rainwater drains well from this road surface." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2017-almanzo-100-the-granddaddy-of-all-gravel-races/)

**Cold/Wet Weather Gear:**

**JOM [COMPETITIVE]:** For 2017's wet, 43°F race day, wore: regular bib shorts with knee warmers, long sleeve base layer with arm warmers, Seal Skinz gloves with hand warmers, Defeet wool socks with toe warmers, Pearl Izumi TT overshoes, Gore Oxygen Gore-Tex 2.0 Active Jacket, sleeveless wind vest as top layer, and Gravel Cyclist cap under helmet. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2017-almanzo-100-the-granddaddy-of-all-gravel-races/)

**High Plains Reader rider [COMPETITIVE]:** Used Kwik Mart grocery bags torn into pieces to line riding shorts and tights "to protect my joints, butt and legs from the rain" plus a large black garbage bag as emergency shelter. "The plastic bags that had once kept me warm had failed and now held forty degree rain water against my skin and in my shoes." DNF'd at mile 23. (https://hpr1.com/index.php/arts-entertainment/outdoors/almanzo-100-wilderfest-bike-race-still-a-rookie/)

**Power/Electronics:**

**Brad Patty [COMPETITIVE]:** "In 2014 I was riding a CX bike with an AL PowerTap hub-based power meter equipped wheel. 2015 saw me riding my mountain bike and recording power via the PowerCal. I had been riding and racing with the PowerCal for about 9 months and knew it seemed accurate... I am also happy to report, the PowerCal is very accurate compared to the PowerTap hub." (https://bikefixation.com/post/blog-15-almanzo-100-lessons-from-two-years-of-gravel-racing)

**Bike Setup:**

**JOM [COMPETITIVE]:** Used Ritchey Breakaway Ti CX bike with two 20oz bottles of water with Gu tabs, Fixit Sticks, mini-pump, saddle bag with tube and levers, Go Pro cameras front and rear, and Garmin 800. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2017-almanzo-100-the-granddaddy-of-all-gravel-races/)

## Weather Experienced

**2017:** JOM reported 43°F at start with steady rain throughout morning. "1.47" of rain" fell during the race. Conditions forecast to clear in afternoon. "This edition will be remembered as the wettest in the history of the race." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2017-almanzo-100-the-granddaddy-of-all-gravel-races/)

**2016:** "Thirty-two degrees at the start and strong winds all day. In 2016, 1,000 riders started and only 500 finished. The last rider crossed the finish line 13 hours after the start." (https://craftedwords.com/portfolio/ride-at-the-heart-of-minnesotas-gravel-scene-stays-true-to-its-origins/)

**2021:** Nicholas Garbis reported "temps were in the 90s with winds gusting up to 25mph" on June 5th. Race time was moved to 8:00am start instead of usual 9:00am due to heat. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2021-spring-valley-almanzo-100-meteor-theory-vs-heat-wave-gravel-vs-skin/)

**2018:** Nicholas Garbis noted "weather that has only come once previously to this event that I know of -- warm and calm with a soft cover of clouds." (https://gravelnewsnetwork.blogspot.com/2018/05/ride-report-19may2018-almanzo-100.html)

**Historical Range:** "The date of the event, normally the first Saturday after Mother's Day (in May) meant the weather had varied from the 30s to the 80s, cold rain to hot sun, mostly wind and sometimes calm." (https://gravelnewsnetwork.blogspot.com/2021/06/race-report-05jun2021-spring-valley.html)

**2011 (Nicholas Garbis' first):** "The temp dropped to 39F and rain started as we were headed into Spring Valley. We finished because we had no Plan B, we were crusted over with grey gravel from head to toe and finished in something like 10:30." (https://gravelnewsnetwork.blogspot.com/2018/05/ride-report-19may2018-almanzo-100.html)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Elevation:** Approximately 7,500 feet of elevation gain over 100 miles. (https://bikefixation.com/post/blog-15-almanzo-100-lessons-from-two-years-of-gravel-racing)

**Specific Climbs/Features:**

- **Oriole Road at mile 91:** Described as "soul-breaking" (https://gravelnewsnetwork.blogspot.com/2021/06/race-report-05jun2021-spring-valley.html)
- **Forestville State Park at mile 70:** Listed as a course milestone (https://bikefixation.com/post/blog-15-almanzo-100-lessons-from-two-years-of-gravel-racing)
- **River crossing at mile 80/81:** Multiple sources confirm water crossing feature (https://bikefixation.com/post/blog-15-almanzo-100-lessons-from-two-years-of-gravel-racing)
- **Preston checkpoint at mile 39-40:** Official aid station location

**Jesse Lindhorst [COMPETITIVE]:** "The course also consisted of seven to eight category five hills, only one of which I was actually able to climb while in the saddle." (https://jesselindhorst.tumblr.com/post/51076284551/the-almanzo-100-a-bike-race-in-spring-valley-that)

**JOM [COMPETITIVE]:** "Within a mile we turned onto the first gravel. There was a bit of moisture on the road surface from the rain in the morning, which did not cause a problem when riding under 20 MPH - but on the first fast descent I learned bike tires will turn this moisture into a fine limestone mist which is launched directly in front of the rider." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2017-almanzo-100-the-granddaddy-of-all-gravel-races/)

**Brad Patty [COMPETITIVE]:** "There was a significant bike difference in 2015 from 2014. In 2014 I was riding a CX bike... 2015 saw me riding my mountain bike." Both bikes worked for completion. (https://bikefixation.com/post/blog-15-almanzo-100-lessons-from-two-years-of-gravel-racing)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Brad Patty [COMPETITIVE] - 200W Average Strategy:**

"I knew from previous long hard-surface rides that I could maintain around 200 watts average power for over 5 hours. I was also able to determine from prior Almanzo 100 races I should be able to average between 15 and 16 MPH." His hourly breakdown for successful 2015 finish:
- Hour 0-1: 16.1 mph, 138 HR, 195W
- Hour 1-2: 16.4 mph, 144 HR, 214W  
- Hour 2-3: 14.1 mph, 143 HR, 211W
- Hour 3-4: 16.7 mph, 140 HR, 201W
- Hour 4-5: 13.9 mph, 144 HR, 216W
- Hour 5-6: 15.9 mph, 143 HR, 211W
- Hour 6-7: 14.3 mph, 141 HR, 205W
- **Race average: 15.4 mph, 142 HR, 208W**

"I felt much better about the race in 2015 because I had developed a sound pace strategy, had the electronics to measure my pace and (this is the hard part) was able to control myself to maintain the pace." (https://bikefixation.com/post/blog-15-almanzo-100-lessons-from-two-years-of-gravel-racing)

**Brad Patty [COMPETITIVE] - Lessons Learned:**

"If you have read my blog article from the race last year, you will know I went too hard at the start of the Almanzo 100 race and paid for it dearly from mile 50 to the finish. I vowed to actually rely on the sophisticated electronics and my analytical brain to select a sustainable pace in 2015." Took 25 minutes off 2014 finish time with better pacing. (https://bikefixation.com/post/blog-15-almanzo-100-lessons-from-two-years-of-gravel-racing)

**Nicholas Garbis [COMPETITIVE] - "Meteor Theory" Approach:**

"It is a plan to go out hot, hotter than what can be sustained, and then slowly peel back... Decreasing speed, increasing suffering the whole way." In 2021 hot edition: "For the first 10 miles, I was averaging 22mph -- that was quite a bit hot and I knew it... at mile 18 average was just under 20mph and we were hold speeds near 25mph." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2021-spring-valley-almanzo-100-meteor-theory-vs-heat-wave-gravel-vs-skin/)

**Nicholas Garbis [COMPETITIVE] - 2018 PR Attempt:**

"As the week progressed and the favorable weather became more certain, I started to plan out an attempt at a besting my personal record of 6:40." In 2018 ideal conditions, he had previously done "about 6:18(?) for the 100 miles" in his fastest effort. (https://gravelnewsnetwork.blogspot.com/2018/05/ride-report-19may2018-almanzo-100.html)

**Aid Station Strategy:**

**Brad Patty [COMPETITIVE]:** "I quickly found my support crew and cheering section (wife), replaced the bottle I had drained and took on three new bottles and additional energy bars. I lubed the chain, switched out my eyewear and grabbed ½ my PB and honey sandwich to eat while riding the next couple miles. I have learned, even if you are moving slower than normal, it is still better than being stopped, so short stops for aid are sufficient." (https://bikefixation.com/post/blog-15-almanzo-100-lessons-from-two-years-of-gravel-racing)

**Nicholas Garbis [COMPETITIVE]:** At Preston mile 40 stop: "I apologized as I required 5 bottles to get my three water bottles and my belly topped off. I ate a pickle wrapped in salami, said thank you, and rolled away." (https://gravelnewsnetwork.blogspot.com/2021/06/race-report-05jun2021-spring-valley.html)

**Drafting Strategy:**

**Brad Patty [COMPETITIVE]:** "I tried to conserve as much energy as possible by drafting riders (especially when riding into the wind) and not sprinting up hills." (https://bikefixation.com/post/blog-15-almanzo-100-lessons-from-two-years-of-gravel-racing)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Hypothermia in Cold/Wet Conditions:**

**High Plains Reader rider [COMPETITIVE]:** DNF'd at mile 23 in cold rain: "Despite the garbage bag I'd stolen the night before, the rain seemed to chill me to the bone. I pedaled harder, momentary pulling ahead of the group in an attempt to warm myself, but was unsuccessful. The plastic bags that had once kept me warm had failed and now held forty degree rain water against my skin and in my shoes. My hands turned into what felt more like claws, requiring a fist instead of a finger to shift my bike." (https://hpr1.com/index.php/arts-entertainment/outdoors/almanzo-100-wilderfest-bike-race-still-a-rookie/)

**JOM [COMPETITIVE]:** "I learned a valuable lesson at Land Run 100 earlier this year, an event I was forced to abandon half way due to symptoms of near hypothermia. Lesson learned, do not underestimate the value of a waterproof shell layer, something I was missing at Land Run." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2017-almanzo-100-the-granddaddy-of-all-gravel-races/)

**Nicholas Garbis [COMPETITIVE]:** In 2017, after 4 hours to Preston (mile 40): "Sullivan and I were shredded (and we had a support vehicle), so we looked at each other and spoke the words that had been thought but not spoken for three hours --- 'I'm done.'" Conditions: 37°F with rain and wind, riding fat bike with 4-inch tires on "peanut-butter roads." (https://gravelnewsnetwork.blogspot.com/2018/05/ride-report-19may2018-almanzo-100.html)

**Heat/Weather Attrition:**

In 2021's hot edition (90s temps, 25mph winds), "350 had registered and 150 had shown up for the event." Many likely no-showed due to forecast. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2021-spring-valley-almanzo-100-meteor-theory-vs-heat-wave-gravel-vs-skin/)

**Navigation Issues:**

**Nicholas Garbis [COMPETITIVE]:** "On the way in the car, I had attempted and failed to load the route into Strava (cannot be done on mobile), and I had no cue sheets or map. Cell service is patchy in the valleys which we would be going in and out of all day... Getting lost in 'no man's land' in between groups of riders was now more than a lonely ride, unprotected from the wind, it was a near guarantee for getting lost and adding miles." Had to call friend to upload GPX file mid-race. (https://gravelnewsnetwork.blogspot.com/2021/06/race-report-05jun2021-spring-valley.html)

**Going Out Too Hard:**

**Brad Patty [COMPETITIVE]:** "If you have read my blog article from the race last year, you will know I went too hard at the start of the Almanzo 100 race and paid for it dearly from mile 50 to the finish." (https://bikefixation.com/post/blog-15-almanzo-100-lessons-from-two-years-of-gravel-racing)

**Fatigue Timeline:**

**Brad Patty [COMPETITIVE]:** "I found my legs were starting to have less snap at mile 70 and by mile 90 I was in full conserve mode flirting with cramps if I pushed above the new ceiling my body had developed." (https://bikefixation.com/post/blog-15-almanzo-100-lessons-from-two-years-of-gravel-racing)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Free Entry Philosophy:**

**Chris Skogen, Founder:** "In the years that led up to the first Almanzo I felt like we, as a society, were being inundated with pay-to-play events that were cloudy at best when it came to telling the participant where the money went. I felt like the world needed something different, something that only stood to benefit those that actually participated, and so it was born." (https://craftedwords.com/portfolio/ride-at-the-heart-of-minnesotas-gravel-scene-stays-true-to-its-origins/)

**Kathy Simpson, Spring Valley Tourism Chairwoman:** "We continue his vision of a free, self-supported race, accessible to anyone with a bike and a desire. Chris put this heart and soul into this race." (https://craftedwords.com/portfolio/ride-at-the-heart-of-minnesotas-gravel-scene-stays-true-to-its-origins/)

**Registration Process:**

**JOM [COMPETITIVE]:** "The race entry fee... is free for all riders. Traditional postcard entry still remains, although nowadays, riders are welcome to email the organizers and register their intent to ride." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2017-almanzo-100-the-granddaddy-of-all-gravel-races/)

**Supportive Community:**

**Chris Chavie, MN Bike Trail Navigator:** "The cycling community is very tight knit, and we've found that everybody helps everybody else. We've told riders that the race isn't for the faint of heart. A lot of people go as far as they can and then arrange pickup from friends." (https://craftedwords.com/portfolio/ride-at-the-heart-of-minnesotas-gravel-scene-stays-true-to-its-origins/)

**Kathy Simpson:** "Riders will stop to help people get back on and going." (https://craftedwords.com/portfolio/ride-at-the-heart-of-minnesotas-gravel-scene-stays-true-to-its-origins/)

**Race vs. Ride Philosophy:**

**Mike Riemer, Salsa Cycles:** "For most folks Almanzo isn't really a race, it's a personal challenge. At the front they'll be full on racing, but for most folks they just want to get to the finish line, and some might care to do it as quickly as possible, but not everyone. Many folks enjoy the looking around, taking it all in, socializing aspect." (https://craftedwords.com/portfolio/ride-at-the-heart-of-minnesotas-gravel-scene-stays-true-to-its-origins/)

**Jesse Lindhorst [COMPETITIVE]:** "The Almanzo is an amazing event that anyone can conquer because it's not about pain or racing or anything like that. Whether you ride 60 miles and drop out or finish just within the twelve hour window with scuffed knees and bent handlebars, it's about getting on a bike and experiencing the journey." (https://jesselindhorst.tumblr.com/post/51076284551/the-almanzo-100-a-bike-race-in-spring-valley-that)

**Historical Significance:**

**JOM [COMPETITIVE]:** "The Almanzo 100 touts itself as the race where it all began; the Granddaddy of all gravel races." Created in 2007 by Chris Skogen with 12 friends; 4 finished. By 2017, over 1,000 riders. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2017-almanzo-100-the-granddaddy-of-all-gravel-races/)

**Mike Riemer, Salsa Cycles:** "Almanzo was the first gravel event to broadly expose the masses to that type of riding. It helped create a community of cyclists that wanted to go take on a reasonable challenge. It also helped teach folks that they might want to consider riding on these gravel roads just for fun." (https://craftedwords.com/portfolio/ride-at-the-heart-of-minnesotas-gravel-scene-stays-true-to-its-origins/)

**Volunteer-Run:**

**Kathy Simpson:** Chairperson of Spring Valley Tourism "volunteers a huge chunk of her time and personal finances, sans remuneration, to bring us the race. Supported by her team of well-organized volunteers, Almanzo is a true gem in the world of gravel racing." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2017-almanzo-100-the-granddaddy-of-all-gravel-races/)

**Pat Sorensen, Penn Cycle President:** "I don't even think about [charging for the race]. I throw as many as people at this event as I need to ensure the quality of the event and maintain Chris's original concept. In honor of Chris's devotion to developing this and his focus on keeping this a free race, I embrace that as well." Penn Cycle provides management and race-day services. (https://craftedwords.com/portfolio/ride-at-the-heart-of-minnesotas-gravel-scene-stays-true-to-its-origins/)

**Growth and Scale:**

"More than 1,000 riders are expected this year. The average time to complete the 100-mile route is about eight hours. The fastest riders finish in just more than five." (https://craftedwords.com/portfolio/ride-at-the-heart-of-minnesotas-gravel-scene-stays-true-to-its-origins/)
