## 2. RACE HISTORY & FOUNDING

### The Birth of Modern Gravel Racing

The Almanzo 100 is widely recognized as **"The Granddaddy of All Gravel Races"** - one of the events that helped kickstart the entire gravel cycling movement in America.

**2007 - Year Zero:**
- Chris Skogen of Minneapolis convinced 12 friends to ride gravel roads in southeastern Minnesota
- Route: Rochester to Mankato
- 13 riders actually showed up
- Only 4 finished the inaugural ride
- "I was nervous and uncertain about a lot of things... I didn't really know how to run a bike race"

**Growth Trajectory:**
- 2007: 12 registered, 4 finished
- 2008: 60 riders
- 2009: 90 riders
- 2010: 400+ riders; moved to Spring Valley as start location
- 2011: 700+ riders; spawned the Almanzo Gravel Road Series
- 2014: 1,400+ participants when Skogen first stepped away

### The Name

Named after **Almanzo Wilder**, husband of Laura Ingalls Wilder. The family spent time on Wilder's family farm outside Spring Valley. The Laura Ingalls Wilder Historic Highway passes through Spring Valley - connecting the race to the region's pioneer heritage.

### Chris Skogen's Philosophy

Skogen started the race because he "was motivated by social justice and social reform." He was part of a rootsy cyclocross scene in Rochester in the early 2000s and felt society was "being inundated with pay-to-play events that were cloudy at best when it came to telling the participant where the money went."

**Core Ethos:** "100% dirt, 100% free, 100% self-supported, 100% amazing"

### Industry Impact

- **2012:** Salsa released the Warbird - the first gravel race-specific bike to hit the market
- **2013:** Challenge Tires debuted the "Almanzo" tire - named directly after this race
- Chris Skogen was inducted into the **Gravel Cycling Hall of Fame**

### Timeline of Changes

- **2014:** Skogen steps away; hands event to Spring Valley Tourism
- **2018:** Final edition under the Almanzo name in Spring Valley
- **2019:** Skogen returns, moves event to Northfield, MN with entirely new courses
- **Later:** Skogen steps away again; event renamed "The Heywood Ride"
- **Ongoing:** Spring Valley continues hosting gravel races under "Spring Valley 100" name

## 3. TERRAIN & COURSE

### Driftless Region Geography

The course traverses the **Driftless Area** - a unique geological region of ~16,000 square miles at the convergence of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, and Illinois. This area was never covered by glaciers, resulting in:

- Rugged terrain with steep bluffs and narrow valleys
- Sedimentary bedrock (Ordovician dolomite, limestone, sandstone)
- Karst topography: caves, sinkholes, springs, disappearing streams
- Very different from the flat, glaciated terrain of most of the Midwest

### Course Characteristics

**Surface Types:**
- Well-maintained gravel roads
- Freshly laid loose stone (energy-sapping)
- Packed dirt
- Some broken pavement
- Creek crossings

**Key Course Features:**

1. **Rolling Terrain:** Southeast Minnesota's hills and river valleys provide constant climbing
2. **6,000+ feet of climbing** over 100 miles
3. **Second-half brutality:** Around mile 65, gravel transitions from hard-pack to fresh, loose stone
4. **Mile 80 Creek Crossing:** A memorable water crossing
5. **Oriole Road Climb (Mile 90):** The soul-crusher
   - GPS readings top out at 17% grade
   - Hike-a-bike is common, even for front-runners
   - "Resembles a wall" at that point in the race

**Scenery:**
- Picturesque farmland
- Towering bluffs and lush green valleys
- Amish farms
- Covered bridges
- Forestville/Mystery Cave State Park

### Road Conditions

Minnesota has approximately **70,000 miles of public gravel roads** (50% of all public roads in the state). The Driftless region roads are characterized by:

- Steeper grades than typical Midwest gravel
- Variable surface quality depending on recent maintenance
- Can become "peanut butter" mud in wet conditions
- Erosion issues due to hilly terrain

## 4. WEATHER

### May in Spring Valley, Minnesota

**Typical Conditions:**
- Average high: 64.9°F (18.3°C)
- Average low: 48.7°F (9.3°C)
- Transitioning from spring to early summer
- Part of the 160-day growing season (longest in Minnesota)

**Historical Race Weather:**

The race has experienced the full spectrum of Minnesota spring weather:
- **Temperature range:** 30s to 80s°F
- **Conditions:** Cold rain, hot sun, wind (mostly windy), occasionally calm

**Notorious Weather Events:**

**2017 "Hellmanzo"** - The wettest edition in race history:
- 40°F temperatures
- Driving rain (1.47 inches fell in Twin Cities that day)
- High winds
- "Slimy, rut-filled roads"
- Riders blind from mud within 10 miles
- Multiple hypothermia cases
- Equipment failures widespread
- Hospital visits for eye injuries from grit
- Riders found holed up in laundromats

**Spring Weather Reality:**
> "Weather is rarely a friend - that's what spring racing is about."

Organizers typically predict "a cool start, with near perfect temperature for gravel racing once riders warm up from climbing the first hills" - but anything can happen.

## 5. FORUM INSIGHTS & COMMUNITY

### Race Community Culture

**Vibe:**
> "A lot of laid back, beard having, Surly riding, tattoo sporting guys having fun and enjoying each other's company."

**Experience:**
> "These events are amazing! It's like riding on the moon or in a parallel dimension compared to typical road rides. You'll go hours without seeing another human."

### Race Reports & Firsthand Accounts

**The Fight Club Rules:**
> "Similar to the mantra in Fight Club, the first three rules for the Almanzo 100 are: You are on your own; You are on your own; You are on your own!"

**On the Second Half:**
> "The toughest part of the course seemed to come in the second half. Starting around mile 65, the gravel turned from a light layer on a hard pack base to a slog of freshly laid stone... groups rode the grass on the side of the road trying to find some respite."

**On Oriole Road:**
> "There is a creek crossing at mile 80 and then the dreaded Oriole Road climb at mile 90. The creek crossing is memorable, but there is no way it shares the dread inspired by the Oriole Road climb."

## 6. BLACK PILL - Honest Truths

### The Hard Realities

**1. This Race Can Break You**
- 2017 edition: 730 signed up, only 177 finished (~24% finish rate)
- Self-support means if you bonk, flat, or freeze - you're on your own
- No SAG support, no aid stations, no excuses

**2. Weather Roulette**
- May in Minnesota is unpredictable
- You might get 80°F sunshine or 35°F freezing rain
- "Hellmanzo" conditions can appear with little warning
- Hypothermia is a real risk in bad years

**3. The Course Doesn't Care About Your Fitness**
- 6,000+ feet of climbing on gravel is different from road
- Fresh loose stone in the second half can destroy your legs
- Oriole Road at mile 90 has made elite riders walk
- Creek crossings mean wet feet regardless of weather

**4. Logistics Are DIY**
- Spring Valley has limited lodging
- Nearest major city (Rochester) is 40 minutes away
- Minneapolis airport is 2+ hours away
- This isn't a destination race with full hospitality

**5. The Event Has Evolved**
- The "Almanzo 100" name is technically retired
- Two successor events now (Heywood in Northfield, Spring Valley 100 in original location)
- Some of the original grassroots magic has been diluted through transitions
- Chris Skogen's absence/presence has created organizational instability

**6. It's Not Actually 100 Miles**
- Course is actually 101 miles
- The Royal is 162 miles
- The Alexander is 380 miles (starts Friday)
- You're getting more than you bargained for

**7. Your Bike Will Suffer**
- Fresh gravel destroys drivetrains
- Mud in wet years clogs everything
- Tire sidewalls get shredded by rocks
- Bring spare everything or be prepared to walk

## 8. SUGGESTED GRAVEL GOD RATINGS

| **Course Challenge** | 4.5/5 | 6,000+ ft climbing on variable gravel, Oriole Road is legendary, second-half fresh stone |
| **Gravel Quality** | 3.5/5 | Variable - can be fast packed dirt or energy-sapping loose stone; weather dependent |

| **Community/Vibe** | 5/5 | THE OG gravel community - laid back, authentic, passionate; this is where gravel culture was born |
| **Weather Risk** | 2/5 | May in Minnesota is a gamble; "Hellmanzo" conditions are legendary for a reason |
