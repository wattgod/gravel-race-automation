# ARDENNE GRAVEL STAGES — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Mariëlle Trouwborst [ELITE]:** "It's great to win the first edition of the Ardenne Garvel Stages, and it was also a good preparation race for the World Gravel Championships in Beek, Limburg, in two weeks" (https://mountainbiketeam.com/en/marielle-trouwborst-wins-3-day-ardenne-gravel-stages/)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Note: The equipment details below come from a different Ardennes race (The Ardennes Monster), not the Ardenne Gravel Stages specifically, but provide insights into gear needs for Belgian Ardennes gravel racing.**

**[COMPETITIVE] rider setup for hilly Ardennes terrain:**
- Cassette: Switched from 10-33T to 10-44T specifically for the hilly course, providing 1:1 gear ratio with 44T chainring
- Derailleur modification: Used Garbaruk derailleur cage on SRAM Force AXS to accommodate the larger 50T-compatible range with oversized pulley wheels
- Knee warmers: "I put on two knee warmers on top of each other" for cold conditions
- Top tube bag: Switched from Restrap (zipper issues) to Apidura Racing Top Tube Pack with magnetic closure for reliability
