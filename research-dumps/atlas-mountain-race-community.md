# ATLAS MOUNTAIN RACE — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Ozogan [UNKNOWN]:** "I was looking forward to solo riding. I had to keep 100% attention because danger lurked at every turn. Bidons were flying around, and the occasional surface change provoked hasty braking manoeuvres." (https://ozogan.eu/atlas-mountain-race-2025/)

**Ozogan [UNKNOWN]:** "Scratching has an unusually high rate for the Atlas Mountain Race. Over 100 people out of 270 didn't finish. Often as a result of: Mechanical problems, Heat, Respiratory problems—dust makes you cough blood, Digestive problems" (https://ozogan.eu/atlas-mountain-race-2025/)

**Ozogan [UNKNOWN]:** "My struggle was deep. I was cold. Not a life-threatening cold. But I was uncomfortable and the race was not going the way I wanted... I made the mistake of inventing my low-cost energy gel. I poured half a litre of syrup into a cycling bottle and intended to sip it and drink it with water. I chose the lemon flavour, which is recommended against over-sweetening. Unfortunately, there was probably quite a bit of citric acid in there, which made some nasty conditions in my mouth. It sprouted blisters on my tongue and the salt of my dry nuts made eating unbearable." (https://ozogan.eu/atlas-mountain-race-2025/)

**Cap 184 Niel Copeland [COMPETITIVE]:** "There are many ways you can experience these races. Just racing it flat-out isn't the only way or the right way for a lot of people. So, I'm just showing that you can put in some good pace but not stress too much about it—stop when you want to and have a really great time." (https://bikepacking.com/plog/2025-atlas-mountain-race-mid-race/)

**Cap 169 Jeff Lou [COMPETITIVE]:** "I had like a 26-hour day… I really need to be more present and just be here. So I think I'm in a little bit of a better headspace right now." (https://bikepacking.com/plog/2025-atlas-mountain-race-mid-race/)

**Cap 202 Valentina [COMPETITIVE]:** "I started in the dark, like at 4:30 a.m., and then I had the sunrise at 8, and it was beautiful. Amazing. I cried a little." (https://bikepacking.com/plog/2025-atlas-mountain-race-mid-race/)

**Cap 161 Eric House and Cap 141 Alex Kowalski [COMPETITIVE]:** "This guy came around, this older gentleman, and waved us in. He said, 'Dormir, manger,' and we were like, 'Yeah!' So he brought us into his little house, made us some tea, some almonds that he grew, some fresh-pressed olive oil that he also grew, and bread, and made a little pallet for us to sleep." (https://bikepacking.com/plog/2025-atlas-mountain-race-mid-race/)

**Cap 66 Joachim Lindhardt [COMPETITIVE]:** "These four Moroccan guys at the café just jumped out and said, 'Oh, we'll try to fix this.' And maybe 10, 15, 30 minutes later, they had this mega fix. They pulled out the pin to get it to connect with the battery again. And then they found a stick to squeeze in there… So basically, I'm back on the road." (https://bikepacking.com/plog/2025-atlas-mountain-race-mid-race/)

**Cap 101 Marei Moldenhauer [COMPETITIVE]:** "I actually found gluten-free cookies at a gas station, which was lovely. But other than that, I'm eating a lot of sugar and dates, which is also fine." (https://bikepacking.com/plog/2025-atlas-mountain-race-mid-race/)

**Carl and unnamed partner [RECREATIONAL]:** "The hardest part of the race for me was the lack of food. The shops only seemed to sell drinks and biscuits, and the cafes only had omelette. I was soon fantasising about what I would eat once we'd finished. This race is not one for people who don't like eggs." (https://restrap.com/blogs/news/atlas-mountain-race-report)

**Carl and unnamed partner [RECREATIONAL]:** "Another challenge on route was the gangs of children. We would spot them up ahead on approach to a village, and they would spot us and congregate on a steep uphill... Mostly they were just interested and keen for a chat, but sometimes they would try and grab at the bikes and our bags or throw rocks. I'm sure someone at the pointy end of the race had been handing out sweets as a race tactic!" (https://restrap.com/blogs/news/atlas-mountain-race-report)

**Carl and unnamed partner [RECREATIONAL]:** "It was lovely to have the company although we couldn't manage to sync up, so most of the time one of us was feeling great and the other was having a bonk, which did not make for a speedy ride." (https://restrap.com/blogs/news/atlas-mountain-race-report)

**Valerio Stuart [COMPETITIVE]:** "Despite my wary stomach, I took the risk and ordered an omelette at the restaurant next-door... My main target for the day was Imassine (258 km), the last real supply point before an arduous 100 km long stretch of remote terrain." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/armchair-adventure-conquering-the-atlas-mountain-race)

**Valerio Stuart [COMPETITIVE]:** "My fears were confirmed when I tried to coast down the next descent, only to have the chain whip forward and fall off again. I had no choice. If I wanted to keep the chain from dropping, I had to keep my legs moving at all times, even on off-road descents. It was absurd and exhausting, but there was nothing else to do except push forward." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/armchair-adventure-conquering-the-atlas-mountain-race)

**Valerio Stuart [COMPETITIVE]:** "By midnight I had ridden 300 km with 6,800 m of climbing - a personal best - but I knew the real challenge lay ahead and forced myself to stop. The moon hung overhead like a spotlight, so bright that it felt like sleeping under a streetlamp. As I lay in my bivvy, my breathing felt restricted and a sudden sense of claustrophobia set in." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/armchair-adventure-conquering-the-atlas-mountain-race)

**Pas Normal Studios featured rider [COMPETITIVE]:** "I began with a relentless 28-hour ride, climbing the height of Everest and covering the distance from Los Angeles to Las Vegas. At last, I stopped at a small café in Aït Saoun, my body heavy with exhaustion. I ordered five omelettes, each with four eggs. As the owner placed the plates in front of me, he glanced around and asked: 'Where are your friends?' 'I'm alone... and very hungry,' I replied." (https://pasnormalstudios.com/int/pages/atlas-mountain-race)

**Pas Normal Studios featured rider [COMPETITIVE]:** "There was a time in the desert when everything seemed to fall apart. I had a flat tire, and my pump broke, leaving me no choice but to walk under a burning sun. I had to take breaks in the shade whenever I could and got dehydrated. Riders passed me and the frustration built up. Eventually, I reached a road, and a truck driver gave me a lift to a nearby village." (https://pasnormalstudios.com/int/pages/atlas-mountain-race)

**Buzzalong rider [UNKNOWN]:** "That first night was brutal! We faced snow and ice, making some sections completely unrideable. I even got lost on that infamous 10-kilometer donkey trail – definitely not my finest moment! I also crashed twice that first night, which shook my confidence a bit." (https://www.buzzalong.cc/post/how-to-bikepack-the-atlas-mountain-race-a-complete-guide)

**Buzzalong rider [UNKNOWN]:** "As I entered this desolate area on day two, I ran out of water and missed a gas station, leaving me with no resupply options. It was a tough mental battle, pushing through that dry, remote landscape." (https://www.buzzalong.cc/post/how-to-bikepack-the-atlas-mountain-race-a-complete-guide)

(https://www.biketour-global.de/en/2026/02/07/bikeanalytics-atlas-mountain-race-2026-2/)

**Tire Pressure Caution [Multiple riders, levels varied]:** "Bidons were flying around, and the occasional surface change provoked hasty braking manoeuvres" - suggests proper tire pressure critical for loose surface changes (https://ozogan.eu/atlas-mountain-race-2025/)

## Weather Experienced

**2020:** "The mild premiere" - surprisingly stable, 0°C to 5°C at night, up to 35°C during the day, hardly any precipitation. (https://www.biketour-global.de/en/2026/02/07/bikeanalytics-atlas-mountain-race-2026-2/)

**2022:** "Heat in the South" - very hot during the day (up to 40°C in the valleys), classically cold at night, bone-dry tracks. (https://www.biketour-global.de/en/2026/02/07/bikeanalytics-atlas-mountain-race-2026-2/)

**2023:** "The cold shock" - extreme year with unusual cold, snow on the passes, temperatures down to -10°C. Many riders had to buy last-minute winter gear at Decathlon in Marrakech. (https://www.biketour-global.de/en/2026/02/07/bikeanalytics-atlas-mountain-race-2026-2/)

**2024:** "Rain, storm & drama" - heavy storm with lots of rain on starting day, authorities initially banned start due to flood risks in the wadis. Later warm (25°C) but extremely windy. (https://www.biketour-global.de/en/2026/02/07/bikeanalytics-atlas-mountain-race-2026-2/)

**2025:** "Technical & Cold" - frosty nights in the High Atlas, very technical stony conditions partly slippery due to light rainfall. (https://www.biketour-global.de/en/2026/02/07/bikeanalytics-atlas-mountain-race-2026-2/)

**2025 Start Night [UNKNOWN]:** "We faced snow and ice, making some sections completely unrideable... The first 120 km were a relentless climb, culminating with the Telouet Pass (2,500m). Switchbacks lined with frozen snow drifts wound their way up the mountain." (https://www.buzzalong.cc/post/how-to-bikepack-the-atlas-mountain-race-a-complete-guide)

**2025 Day 3 [UNKNOWN]:** "I left CP2 early in the morning, determined to reach the old colonial road before sunset, knowing it was a tough section. It was super cold, and I stopped at the first resupply cafe to warm up with some Moroccan tea, an omelette, bread, and energizing Amlou." (https://www.buzzalong.cc/post/how-to-bikepack-the-atlas-mountain-race-a-complete-guide)

**Night Duration:** "Nights in Morocco are long in February, around 12 hours, and tend to be very cold." (https://www.buzzalong.cc/post/how-to-bikepack-the-atlas-mountain-race-a-complete-guide)

**Anti-Atlas Heat [COMPETITIVE]:** "By day 5 Checkpoint 3 was in sight... At 11am it was far hotter than on previous days, and we had just started hikeabiking up the switchbacks on the last proper climb. As the temperature ramped up Carl started to really struggle with the heat." (https://restrap.com/blogs/news/atlas-mountain-race-report)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Telouet Pass/Mule Track [UNKNOWN]:** "At the top, the first, famous section of the Atlas Mountain Race—the Mule track—awaited me. A short descent of 600 meters spiced up with big and pointy rocks. At the start, we were advised not to ride it because the trail was covered by snow and ice... I struggled with frozen drifts and my foot fell in several times. In a little over an hour it was over." (https://ozogan.eu/atlas-mountain-race-2025/)

**Mule Track Descent [UNKNOWN]:** "Once at the summit, all you could see was a long string of headlights snaking down a treacherous mule track. The path often disappeared and I navigated my way forward using tyre marks from the riders ahead. Most of the descent was on a narrow gorge peppered with boulders and ice. I rode short parts of it but with 1,200km to go, it simply felt not worth the risk. Instead, I opted for running using my bike as a crutch." (https://www.buzzalong.cc/post/how-to-bikepack-the-atlas-mountain-race-a-complete-guide)

**River Crossings [UNKNOWN]:** "First I crossed the Dadès river. It was not difficult, and the water was barely up to my knees. Do you call this a river crossing?" (https://ozogan.eu/atlas-mountain-race-2025/)

**Afra Riverbed [UNKNOWN]:** "After leaving Afra at 4 a.m., I immediately faced a riverbed section where I got completely lost, losing a lot of precious time. It was a frustrating start, but thankfully, the sun came up and I found my way back on track." (https://www.buzzalong.cc/post/how-to-bikepack-the-atlas-mountain-race-a-complete-guide)

**Anti-Atlas Remote Section:** "Imassine (258 km), the last real supply point before an arduous 100 km long stretch of remote terrain" and "100-kilometre section where there is (supposedly) desert, desert and nothing but desert." (Multiple sources)

**M'Goun Gorge [from official description]:** "After the gorge, the route reconnects with more familiar ground: the colonial piste to Afra, the climb to Aguinane and CP2, the old colonial road, and the long final stretch to Essaouira." Note: 2026 includes new route through M'Goun gorge with mule trail through river itself. (https://www.themountainraces.cc/atlas-mountain-race)

**Dry Riverbeds [COMPETITIVE]:** "The trail dipped into a dry valley, crossing sunbaked riverbeds that required short hike-a-bike sections. In some of these dry riverbeds, small windows and doorways were carved into the rock, with families working nearby." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/armchair-adventure-conquering-the-atlas-mountain-race)

**Colonial Road [RECREATIONAL]:** "We tackled the old colonial road climb at night, navigating the two broken sections of road in the dark, before sleeping just off the track. I was happy to not be able to see the sheer drop into the valley, and had been trying to cycle as far from the edge as possible, although annoyingly the smoothest path was often nearest the edge." (https://restrap.com/blogs/news/atlas-mountain-race-report)

**Plateau Section [COMPETITIVE]:** "This was a long stretch of remoteness with no resupply but we were rewarded for all the climbing with an incredible track across the plateau. The views were stunning as we rode along the piste above steep canyons and descended towards Afra. This ended up being the favourite section of the route for both of us." (https://restrap.com/blogs/news/atlas-mountain-race-report)

**2026 Route Change:** "2026 will be a year of change for the AMR. For the first time since its inception we will start the race in Beni-Mellal... This allows us to explore a new crossing of the High Atlas and the incredible gorges of M'Goun. What this means is that the first 300km of the race route are completely new. It does also mean that we will no longer be heading over the iconic Telouet pass." New route: ~1350km and 25,000m elevation (up from 21,000m). (https://www.themountainraces.cc/atlas-mountain-race)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Sleep Strategy [COMPETITIVE - Valerio Stuart]:** "Since Transcontinental Race, I've figured out a pattern that works for me, and I've been sticking to it. I'm not the fastest rider, but I can keep moving and spend a lot of time in the saddle. I knew the first day was going to be a 24-hour+ ride since Atlas Mountain Race starts at 6pm. Because this race is relatively 'short,' my plan was to sleep outside only. I started with about 3h30 the first night, then gradually cut it down, adjusting based on how I felt. Even adding 30 minutes of sleep can totally change how the next day feels." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/armchair-adventure-conquering-the-atlas-mountain-race)

**Pacing Philosophy [COMPETITIVE - Valerio Stuart]:** "One thing I knew from previous editions - many riders wouldn't make it to the finish (note - the scratch rate from the AMR is approximately 50%). Those who go out too hard often pay the price. My plan was to pace myself and see if the past months of training had paid off." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/armchair-adventure-conquering-the-atlas-mountain-race)

**First Day Output [COMPETITIVE - Valerio Stuart]:** "By midnight I had ridden 300 km with 6,800 m of climbing - a personal best." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/armchair-adventure-conquering-the-atlas-mountain-race)

**Pairs Racing Challenge [RECREATIONAL]:** "Riding as a pair was making the route feel more like fun weekend riding than racing. It was lovely to have the company although we couldn't manage to sync up, so most of the time one of us was feeling great and the other was having a bonk, which did not make for a speedy ride." (https://restrap.com/blogs/news/atlas-mountain-race-report)

**Night Riding vs Sleep Decision [RECREATIONAL]:** "By day 5 Checkpoint 3 was in sight, and we decided to press on to get there rather than stopping at our normal sleeping time... we decided to push on and ride to the finish rather than stop for a proper sleep. We were hoping to get as many miles as possible done while it was cooler, with the plan of a potential afternoon nap while it was hot. At the time this seemed very sensible... Unfortunately our ingenious plan did not work out." (https://restrap.com/blogs/news/atlas-mountain-race-report)

**Accommodation Decision [COMPETITIVE]:** "I got there at 1 a.m. and managed to find a cafe where I ate an omelette. Thankfully, they also rented rooms for 200 Moroccan Dirham. I decided to take a room and get a 5-hour rest to recharge and avoid riding in the dark for a while." (https://www.buzzalong.cc/post/how-to-bikepack-the-atlas-mountain-race-a-complete-guide)

**Nutrition Strategy [UNKNOWN - 48-hour plan]:** "Precision Fuel & Hydration: 90-gram gels (10), 300-gram gel (1) in my flow bottle, Chews (10), Electrolytes. Most nutrition stored in my Albion cargo vest with my Apidura 2L water bladder. After 48 hours, I relied on cafes and small shops for food like cookies, honey, and omelettes." (https://www.buzzalong.cc/post/how-to-bikepack-the-atlas-mountain-race-a-complete-guide)

**Expected Completion Time:** "Riders can expect approximately 1350km in distance, 25,000m of climbing and 8 days to complete the route." (https://www.themountainraces.cc/atlas-mountain-race)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Historical Scratch Rates:**
- 2020: 34% (65 of 192 scratched)
- 2022: 34% (47 of 139 scratched)
- 2023: 42% (84 of 200 scratched) - "very high scratch rate due to stomach problems & cold"
- 2024: 40% (91 of 228 scratched)
- 2025: 45% (121 of 268 scratched) - "very technical terrain, many mechanicals"
(https://www.biketour-global.de/en/2026/02/07/bikeanalytics-atlas-mountain-race-2026-2/)

**Common Failure Modes [UNKNOWN]:** "Mechanical problems, Heat, Respiratory problems—dust makes you cough blood, Digestive problems" (https://ozogan.eu/atlas-mountain-race-2025/)

**Mechanical Disaster Example [COMPETITIVE - Valerio Stuart]:** "My chain jumped off the chainring... my pedals were spinning even though I wasn't turning them. Something seemed to be wrong with my rear hub. I suspected that dirt and sand had jammed the springs in my freehub, causing the cassette to engage even when I wasn't pedalling... I had no choice. If I wanted to keep the chain from dropping, I had to keep my legs moving at all times, even on off-road descents." Rider continued 1,000km despite this issue. (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/armchair-adventure-conquering-the-atlas-mountain-race)

**Navigation Error [COMPETITIVE]:** "When I glanced back, I saw another rider. I carried on following the GPS track, perplexed, until I decided to stop and check my location. My heart sank. I was 15 km off-route. The other rider? A scratcher heading back to Marrakech." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/armchair-adventure-conquering-the-atlas-mountain-race)

**Early Mechanicals/Injuries [UNKNOWN]:** "Some were already scratching due to injuries or mechanicals" in first night. (https://www.buzzalong.cc/post/how-to-bikepack-the-atlas-mountain-race-a-complete-guide)

**Dehydration Risk [UNKNOWN]:** "As I entered this desolate area on day two, I ran out of water and missed a gas station, leaving me with no resupply options." (https://www.buzzalong.cc/post/how-to-bikepack-the-atlas-mountain-race-a-complete-guide)

**Nutrition Failure [UNKNOWN]:** "Maybe it was pre-race nerves, or maybe it was the unwise decision to eat my weight in Moroccan sweets earlier that day. Either way, I had to make an emergency pit stop in a nearby field not even 30km into the race. The stomach cramps persisted and I stopped eating, which is capital sin #1 in cycling and ultra-racing." (https://www.buzzalong.cc/post/how-to-bikepack-the-atlas-mountain-race-a-complete-guide)

**Mental Breaking Point [COMPETITIVE]:** "I was 15 km off-route... The realisation hit hard, as I shouted profanities in the air and for a moment, seriously considered quitting." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/armchair-adventure-conquering-the-atlas-mountain-race)

**Panic Attack [COMPETITIVE]:** "The moon hung overhead like a spotlight, so bright that it felt like sleeping under a streetlamp. As I lay in my bivvy, my breathing felt restricted and a sudden sense of claustrophobia set in. I sat up, gasping for air, having some sort of panic attack." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/armchair-adventure-conquering-the-atlas-mountain-race)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Local Hospitality [COMPETITIVE]:** "One of my favorite parts of following this race—both as a racer and a member of the media team—is the generosity of the people along the route. This race runs through remote villages, and time and again, locals welcome riders in with open arms." Examples include local mechanics fixing bikes and families offering tea, food, and shelter. (https://bikepacking.com/plog/2025-atlas-mountain-race-mid-race/)

**Community vs Competition [RECREATIONAL]:** "At the back of the pack the competition was with the route itself rather than with each other, and we were happily seeing the same faces every day... Due to the lack of resupply we often had lunch and dinner with other riders at the only possible cafe/shop and really enjoyed the comradery." (https://restrap.com/blogs/news/atlas-mountain-race-report)

**Local Interactions [UNKNOWN]:** "No matter how many people lived there, they always waved cheerfully at me. Hikers, motorcyclists and drivers." (https://ozogan.eu/atlas-mountain-race-2025/)

**Children Encounters [RECREATIONAL]:** "We would spot them up ahead on approach to a village, and they would spot us and congregate on a steep uphill. We would slowly weave our way through the village to cries of 'Bonjour, Hello' and 'Chocolate! Chocolate!' and they would run along side us effortlessly as we struggled along. I lost a lot of races to children on foot or on barely ridable old bikes without brakes on this trip!" (https://restrap.com/blogs/news/atlas-mountain-race-report)

**Start Atmosphere [UNKNOWN]:** "The peloton rolled out at 6 p.m. under police escort, a mass of riders taking over entire roads of Marrakech, the setting sun casting long shadows. It felt more like the opening of the Tour de France than a bikepacking race." (https://www.buzzalong.cc/post/how-to-bikepack-the-atlas-mountain-race-a-complete-guide)

**Media Team Role [COMPETITIVE - Media perspective]:** "Being on the media team is a different kind of endurance effort. We're constantly moving, balancing tight timelines, tracking riders, and trying to be in the right place at the right time. Naturally, seeing us is a morale boost for riders—we're often the only other people they see out there—but our goal is to document, not intervene. Atlas is a self-supported race, and that includes emotional support." (https://bikepacking.com/plog/2025-atlas-mountain-race-mid-race/)

**Family Following:** "One of the most rewarding parts of this work is seeing how much the community loves and appreciates it—especially the riders' family members, who follow every update closely." (https://bikepacking.com/plog/2025-atlas-mountain-race-mid-race/)

**Women's Field Growth:** "This is the deepest women's field we've ever had" (2025); 54 female participants (20%) in 2026. (https://bikepacking.com/plog/2025-atlas-mountain-race-mid-race/ and https://www.biketour-global.de/en/2026/02/07/bikeanalytics-atlas-mountain-race-2026-2/)

**Cultural Experience:** "Morocco is a country where African, Arab and European cultures are entwined... It is a land of tolerance, a blend of cultures and religions, a country renowned for its hospitality. The fascinating mixture of history, art, food, music and architecture makes Morocco an unforgettable destination." (https://www.themountainraces.cc/atlas-mountain-race)

**Race Philosophy (from Mike Hall essay):** "Rider-led racing grew out of the World Cycle Race and its ethos is to bring racing back to where it was over a century ago: when riders challenged each other over impossibly long distances and without the support and conveniences associated with today's racing... Central to sport after all is that it's a game, and fundamentally pointless. Therein lies its beauty." (https://www.themountainraces.cc/atlas-mountain-race)
