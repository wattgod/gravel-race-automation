# BADLANDS — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Rob Britton [ELITE]:** Winner of 2023 Badlands, providing race commentary: "Badlands is won almost as quickly as it starts. It's one of the fastest races and the winner will likely arrive in the early hours of Tuesday morning." (https://dotwatcher.cc/feature/badlands-2024-race-report-and-winner)

**Cara Dixon [ELITE]:** First woman finisher 2024, 7th overall: "Arguably the first big win of my career and the hardest ride of my life has obviously left me an emotional wreck. Two months ago this wasn't even on the cards, I think my result last year had left me thinking that returning would put an uncomfortable amount of pressure on myself." (https://gravgrav.cc/en/article/badlands-2024-race-report)

**Cara Dixon [ELITE]:** On the Gorafe Desert section: "It was 100km to Gor, the next resupply point, and the temperatures in the desert were sweltering. I tried to ration my water as best I could for the next 6 hours, but the temperature reaching 42 degrees almost broke me. Just before the climb out of the desert I had to lie down, I knew my body well enough to know that I was balancing on the edge of heat stroke." (https://gravgrav.cc/en/article/badlands-2024-race-report)

**James [ELITE]:** On preparation: "One thing that became apparent to me early in the year was that I was going to need to spend a lot of time in the saddle. An hour here and a couple of hours there wasn't going to build the endurance I needed for Badlands. I was going to have to change my training plan and make some sacrifices." (https://www.voomnutrition.co.uk/blog/badlands-race-report-the-worlds-most-brutal-gravel-race/)

**James [ELITE]:** On the lowest point: "By late afternoon I had reached the foothills of La Alpujarra, on the southern slopes of the Sierra Nevada. This was definitely one of the toughest sections of the route, with an elevation gain of 2600m in just 80km. The tank was empty. I sat on the side of the road, my head in my hands, wondering where I could pull the reserves from to get me to the end. A lady came out of her house, with a tray and put it down beside me. A jug of water, a ham and cheese sandwich and a bag of crisps... Without being too melodramatic, I think that ham and cheese sandwich quite literally saved my life." (https://www.voomnutrition.co.uk/blog/badlands-race-report-the-worlds-most-brutal-gravel-race/)

**Bradley Shenton [COMPETITIVE]:** On the opening pace: "I'd heard that the start of Badlands can go off pretty hard, so I tried as much as I could to move up during the neutralised section. As soon as the police pulled off, it was full gas, and straight away I knew the jacket needed to go." (https://road.cc/offroad/content/feature/badlands-2023-my-epic-journey-through-europes-toughest-gravel-race-13439)

**Bradley Shenton [COMPETITIVE]:** On the reality check: "About 10km into the climb I find myself next to Rob Britton, eventual winner of Badlands, who turns to me and mutters 'If this is the pace of the race, we'll be laughing and on for an easy ride'. Hearing this gave me no confidence boost, as I was already struggling and hanging on with all my might." (https://road.cc/offroad/content/feature/badlands-2023-my-epic-journey-through-europes-toughest-gravel-race-13439)

**Tristan (competitive rider) [COMPETITIVE]:** Referenced by Bradley: "My buddy Tristan (who placed one place in front of me at the end) was in the front pack with me at the start and mentioned that the first three hours were ridden at 4w/kg, for a 750km race." (https://road.cc/offroad/content/feature/badlands-2023-my-epic-journey-through-europes-toughest-gravel-race-13439)

**Chris Tonge [ELITE]:** On the Tabernas ramblas: "Riding through the ramblas was like navigating through a maze made of sand, loose gravel, and rocks. These dry riverbeds, which swell with water during rare rainstorms but are bone dry for most of the year, are notorious for being hard to navigate. You can't always rely on GPS or trail markers to guide you, as the landscape constantly shifts with each passing season." (https://www.buzzalong.cc/post/badlands-race-recap-800-km-ultra-cycling-gravel-race-through-the-desert)

**Simon McNamara [COMPETITIVE]:** On the experience: "For me, riding Badlands was everything I'd hoped it would be, it was brutal, beautiful, emotional and genuinely one of the best experiences on or off the bike that I have had in my life." (https://eu.huntbikewheels.com/blogs/news/ditching-the-desk-simon-and-claire-at-badlands)

**Claire [COMPETITIVE]:** On the heat challenges: "The climb was unforgiving, the steep gradients and midday sun took its toll and sleep deprivation meant I had to stop on the descent to close my eyes for 5 minutes... I struggled with heatstroke and fuelling in the heat." (https://eu.huntbikewheels.com/blogs/news/ditching-the-desk-simon-and-claire-at-badlands)

**Chris Hall [UNKNOWN]:** On returning after massive preparation ride: "The gap between finishing the perimeter of Britain project and Badlands was just over 1 week. I think I always knew it was a big ask to be able to complete both especially when I was so fatigued... No matter how much I ate or drank I just had zero energy." (https://www.siestacampers.com/blog/badlands-gravel-challenge)

**Chris Hall [UNKNOWN]:** On his DNF decision: "I was completely at peace with the idea of stopping. I find it really interesting trying to learn and figure out the limitations of my body and it turned out that was the limitation this time... Maybe I could have gone on a bit longer but I didn't need to. I didn't need to make myself unwell or take any silly risks." (https://www.siestacampers.com/blog/badlands-gravel-challenge)

**Gearing Warning - Bradley Shenton [COMPETITIVE]:** "At hour three I decided to back it off and ride my own race. Around 65km... I hit The Mirador del Fin del Mundo, an iconic climb that has an average gradient of 15 per cent, ramping up to a maximum of 25 per cent. This is where I truly realised I had messed up with my gears, a 40T chainring with an 11-42T cassette on the back, my knees were in for a long and grindy few days."

(https://www.buzzalong.cc/post/badlands-race-recap-800-km-ultra-cycling-gravel-race-through-the-desert)

**Critical Tire Note - Chris Tonge [ELITE]:** Mixed tire setup worked well: "My Pirelli Cinturato Gravel M tires at the rear and Schwalbe Thunder Burt at the back, both set up tubeless with Silca sealant, provided excellent grip in the loose sand and rocky terrain. This, combined with my Redshift suspension stem, absorbed a lot of the rough impacts, keeping me comfortable and in control." (https://www.buzzalong.cc/post/badlands-race-recap-800-km-ultra-cycling-gravel-race-through-the-desert)

**Tire Failure - Cara Dixon [ELITE]:** "8 km from Capileira my tyre punctured, a big slice down my sidewall from my overeagerness to finish. At that distance even if I had walked the rest I would have still finished ahead of the next rider. But a combination of stress, sleep deprivation and the flies and wasps buzzing around my head really left me at one of my lowest points. I pumped up my tire 3 times between then and the finish." (https://gravgrav.cc/en/article/badlands-2024-race-report)

## Weather Experienced

**2023 - Storm Conditions:** "For an area that receives less than 30mm of rainfall annually, we were now in the path a huge storm, scheduled to arrive on race day, bringing with it potential flash floods, strong winds and a significant drop in temperature. A last minute change to the route, to avoid some river beds and some other hazardous areas... Badlands had just been re-branded as WorseLands!" - James [ELITE] (https://www.voomnutrition.co.uk/blog/badlands-race-report-the-worlds-most-brutal-gravel-race/)

**2023 - Bradley's Experience:** "Initially it was certainly the weather. Heavy rain on gritty trails was causing problems with the bike, the temperature, the ground conditions, and my anatomy. I hadn't anticipated a long first day in the saddle wearing wet clothes." - Bradley Shenton [COMPETITIVE] (https://road.cc/offroad/content/feature/badlands-2023-my-epic-journey-through-europes-toughest-gravel-race-13439)

**2023 - Calar Alto Observatory:** "After a long descent on the other side however, the temperature started to soar well up into 40's." Following a cold, windy night at 2,168m elevation. - James [ELITE] (https://www.voomnutrition.co.uk/blog/badlands-race-report-the-worlds-most-brutal-gravel-race/)

**2024 - Start Conditions:** "The race rolled out under clear skies and already warm temperatures (23c) this morning at 8:00am local time." - Rob Britton [ELITE] (https://dotwatcher.cc/feature/badlands-2024-race-report-and-winner)

**2024 - Cara's Desert Experience:** "The temperatures in the desert were sweltering. I tried to ration my water as best I could for the next 6 hours, but the temperature reaching 42 degrees almost broke me." - Cara Dixon [ELITE] (https://gravgrav.cc/en/article/badlands-2024-race-report)

**2024 - Day Two Heat:** "As for the leading riders they pushed on and by dawn they were already down on the south coast, where the temperatures were already in the 30s." - Chris Tonge [ELITE] (https://bikepacking.com/tracker/badlands-2024/)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Opening Climbs - First Reality Check:** "Section One: Riders leave Granada... Kilometer 61 will be the first opportunity for resupply, which feels a fitting introduction to Badlands' well-known long and dry stretches." The opening climb is 20km with 850m elevation through El Sacromonte. (https://dotwatcher.cc/feature/badlands-2024-race-report-and-winner)

**Mirador del Fin del Mundo:** "This iconic climb is only 700m in length but has an average of 15% and a maximum gradient over 25%." Located around 79km into the race. (https://bikepacking.com/tracker/badlands-2024/)

**Gorafe Desert Section:** "Remote, wild and isolated place with little or no access to water or food. It can also get extremely hot in normal years. I rode most of this section through the night, and got my first taste of the Badlands. I was very much on my own. The solitude, the vulnerability, the sheer scale of the place was quite overwhelming." - James [ELITE] (https://www.voomnutrition.co.uk/blog/badlands-race-report-the-worlds-most-brutal-gravel-race/)

**Gorafe Desert Entry:** Bradley [COMPETITIVE] describes: "A few of the Spanish riders in front of us took shelter until the shower had passed... I was cruising just outside the top 10 with the village of Gor in my sights, about 50km away. I remember this part so vividly. I was riding solo, and the 'climb' section came up on my Wahoo, with the climb length stating '39km'. All I could do was laugh, literally out loud, at the sheer length of such a climb." (https://road.cc/offroad/content/feature/badlands-2023-my-epic-journey-through-europes-toughest-gravel-race-13439)

**Gor Village - Resupply Haven:** "Arriving in Gor was such a special moment and something I will cherish forever. Music is pumping, the village is out for support and Santiago is there with his trusty handycam to capture it all. The village of Gor is where Badlands started to take its victims. Of the first front 12 riders that arrived in Gor, only six or so finished the race." - Bradley [COMPETITIVE] (https://road.cc/offroad/content/feature/badlands-2023-my-epic-journey-through-europes-toughest-gravel-race-13439)

**Calar Alto Observatory:** "Sitting at the highest point on the route at 2,168m, which in the early hours was rather chilly and very windy. Not a place to get a mechanical." - James [ELITE] (https://www.voomnutrition.co.uk/blog/badlands-race-report-the-worlds-most-brutal-gravel-race/)

**Remote Section Warning:** "Section Three features the most remote part; the 115km stretch from Gor to Velefique offers no resupply. This part is characterised by large areas of woodland, a large number of cycle paths, long ascents and plains at over 2,000 metres." (https://dotwatcher.cc/feature/badlands-2024-race-report-and-winner)

**Tabernas Desert - The Ramblas:** "Riding through the ramblas was like navigating through a maze made of sand, loose gravel, and rocks. These dry riverbeds... are notorious for being hard to navigate. You can't always rely on GPS or trail markers to guide you, as the landscape constantly shifts with each passing season... The ramblas are wide, with unpredictable terrain that can change from hard-packed sand to loose, deep gravel in an instant." - Chris Tonge [ELITE] (https://www.buzzalong.cc/post/badlands-race-recap-800-km-ultra-cycling-gravel-race-through-the-desert)

**Cabo de Gata Beach Push:** "A tedious and unforgiving 2km push along the beach in deep sand, in the small hours of the night got me to the town Almeria." - James [ELITE] (https://www.voomnutrition.co.uk/blog/badlands-race-report-the-worlds-most-brutal-gravel-race/)

**Cabo de Gata - Cara's Experience:** "Through the dawn I made my way down the coast to Cabo de Gata, the soft sand makes riding impossible so I pushed. I thought the waters edge would be more firmly packed so I detoured there, unfortunately this was not the case so I just enjoyed the cooling water on my feet." - Cara Dixon [ELITE] (https://gravgrav.cc/en/article/badlands-2024-race-report)

**El Muro and Final Climbs:** "After surviving tabernas and the climb out of Instincion, I faced the infamous 'El Muro'—a 15-20 kilometer climb on a concrete road with gradients as steep as 25%." - Chris Tonge [ELITE] (https://www.buzzalong.cc/post/badlands-race-recap-800-km-ultra-cycling-gravel-race-through-the-desert)

**La Alpujarra - The Final Test:** "Dubbed as potentially the hardest section of the route due to the elevation gains, a finish at Badlands will not come for free! Riders are continually tested on this route and there's no offering of a celebratory last few kilometres. The 2,700m of climbing in the 80km from Darrical to Capiliera are eye watering." (https://dotwatcher.cc/feature/badlands-2024-race-report-and-winner)

**Dangerous Hike-a-Bike Section:** Cara [ELITE] notes: "I carried my bike down and up the ravine with 14km to go, realising how much scarier that traverse is in the daylight." Chris Tonge [ELITE] adds: "Just before midnight, I rolled across the finish line, tired but grateful for this experience! My Bike Setup for Badlands... a dangerous hike-a-bike stretch where a wrong step could send you over a cliff." (https://gravgrav.cc/en/article/badlands-2024-race-report and https://www.buzzalong.cc/post/badlands-race-recap-800-km-ultra-cycling-gravel-race-through-the-desert)

**Scoria Road Surface:** Course described as "Rugged Badlands backcountry gravel roads. Some of the gravel in the Badlands may remind you of the your gravel roads back home, but some of it is made up of crushed red scoria rock. When the scoria is freshly laid it can be large and sharp at first, but once it is worn in by truck traffic, the gravel turns hard and smooth and in the right conditions it is very fast and fun." (https://www.experienceland.org/badlands-gravel-battle) *Note: This is from North Dakota's Badlands Gravel Battle, different event*

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Elite Opening Pace - WARNING:** "My buddy Tristan (who placed one place in front of me at the end) was in the front pack with me at the start and mentioned that the first three hours were ridden at 4w/kg, for a 750km race." - Bradley Shenton [COMPETITIVE], noting this was ELITE pace that he couldn't sustain. (https://road.cc/offroad/content/feature/badlands-2023-my-epic-journey-through-europes-toughest-gravel-race-13439)

**Competitive Rider Reality Check:** "At hour three I decided to back it off and ride my own race." - Bradley Shenton [COMPETITIVE], after trying to hang with elite riders at 4w/kg. (https://road.cc/offroad/content/feature/badlands-2023-my-epic-journey-through-europes-toughest-gravel-race-13439)

**Pre-Race Plan vs. Reality - James [ELITE]:** "Before leaving the UK for Granada, I certainly had a simple game plan in my mind, 200k a day, averaging 10kph, 4 hours sleep and that would get me to the end in a very respectable 4 days. Ride my own race and don't get drawn into anything beyond my own capabilities, especially at the start." (https://www.voomnutrition.co.uk/blog/badlands-race-report-the-worlds-most-brutal-gravel-race/)

**Day One Reality - James [ELITE]:** "I rode 280km the first day before deciding to stop in a small village, re-fuel and take a short power sleep on a picnic table just outside the desert. Two hours later I was back on my bike. 4am." (https://www.voomnutrition.co.uk/blog/badlands-race-report-the-worlds-most-brutal-gravel-race/)

**Gor Stop Mistake - Bradley [COMPETITIVE]:** "I rushed into the cafe, but I didn't take the time to sit down and have a proper meal, I was so focused on keeping my stop time down to a minimum, I just asked for a couple of bocadillos to go and got going as quickly as I could, that was a rookie error and something I learned the hard way." (https://road.cc/offroad/content/feature/badlands-2023-my-epic-journey-through-europes-toughest-gravel-race-13439)

**Night Riding Strategy - Chris Tonge [ELITE]:** "My experience in ultra-cycling taught me the importance of pacing and not going out too hard early on. By sticking to my strategy, I climbed from position 100 to the top 20 by morning... Starting the climb out of Nijar early in the morning (2 am) was crucial to avoiding the worst of the midday heat." (https://www.buzzalong.cc/post/badlands-race-recap-800-km-ultra-cycling-gravel-race-through-the-desert)

**Cara's Night Strategy [ELITE]:** "I rushed to the shop to buy food for the night and as I left I was met by Svenja. Having raced her a few times before over shorter distances I was well aware of how strong a racer she is, so I quickly stuffed my bags and pockets with food and set off on the long climb to Calar Alto. The night was nicer to me, the cooler temperatures lifted my spirits and I listened to music as I climbed and descended through Sierra de Baza." (https://gravgrav.cc/en/article/badlands-2024-race-report)

**Sleep Deprivation Management - James [ELITE]:** "By the second half of the day, the temperature was beginning to take its toll. I was vomiting and unable to keep anything down, my feet and hands were getting blisters, everything in my head was echoing. It wasn't until I literally fell asleep on my bike and veered off the track that I decided to stop. I was so close to scratching at that point. A 45 minute power nap was enough to lower my heart rate, regain my composure and push on." (https://www.voomnutrition.co.uk/blog/badlands-race-report-the-worlds-most-brutal-gravel-race/)

**Cara's Sleep Management [ELITE]:** "Sleep deprivation meant I had to stop on the descent to close my eyes for 5 minutes." Later: "I rolled out of the town with my eyes now set on the finish." - indicating minimal to no sleep for podium contenders. (https://gravgrav.cc/en/article/badlands-2024-race-report)

**Nutrition Strategy - James [ELITE]:** "My strategy for fuelling the race was simple. Carry as much carbohydrates and salts as my bag set up would allow. I think I ended up with about 1800g of carbs on board, made up from Fusion Fuel sachets, Pocket Rockets, Hydrate Smart, and for variety, mixed that with some other high carb bars and gels. My aim was to consume about 60g of carbs per hour and supplement that with real food when the opportunities arose. I also carried additional salt tablets." (https://www.voomnutrition.co.uk/blog/badlands-race-report-the-worlds-most-brutal-gravel-race/)

**Real Food Importance:** "Boccadillos were a staple part of my diet." - James [ELITE]. Bradley [COMPETITIVE] regretted not sitting down for a proper meal at Gor. (https://www.voomnutrition.co.uk/blog/badlands-race-report-the-worlds-most-brutal-gravel-race/)

**Emergency Fueling - Chris Tonge [ELITE]:** "As I began to run low on food, I stopped at a bar and, in desperation, bought a kilo of sugar—the most expensive sugar I've ever purchased. But it kept me going through the final section." (https://www.buzzalong.cc/post/badlands-race-recap-800-km-ultra-cycling-gravel-race-through-the-desert)

**Heat Management - Chris Tonge [ELITE]:** "At one point, I stopped at a beach town to wash my bike, top off my supplies, and grab some ice. Though other riders overtook me here, I didn't let it bother me. I treated it as part of the experience and focused on riding my race." (https://www.buzzalong.cc/post/badlands-race-recap-800-km-ultra-cycling-gravel-race-through-the-desert)

**Pairs Strategy - Claire [COMPETITIVE]:** "We should perhaps have done some practice rides to get to know each other better, or for Simon to try sleeping in a bivi bag and packing his kit, but our only test run was a 60km cafe ride the week before the race... He was immediately ahead of me but as agreed we would both settle into our own paces on the climbs and regroup along the way." (https://eu.huntbikewheels.com/blogs/news/ditching-the-desk-simon-and-claire-at-badlands)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Attrition at Gor (230km):** "The village of Gor is where Badlands started to take its victims. Of the first front 12 riders that arrived in Gor, only six or so finished the race. The first 12 hours over that first 250km were hard racing, and it was a true turning point for me, too." - Bradley Shenton [COMPETITIVE] (https://road.cc/offroad/content/feature/badlands-2023-my-epic-journey-through-europes-toughest-gravel-race-13439)

**Elite DNFs in Gorafe:** "The Gorafe Desert also claimed two riders from the lead group. Both Rick Steffan and Matthew Bird were forced to withdraw after separate crashes. The unforgiving terrain, coupled with the accumulating fatigue, served as a constant reminder of the challenges inherent in ultra-distance racing." (https://bikepacking.com/news/event-recaps/badlands-2024-recap/)

**Notable DNFs - Gor 2024:** "There were some non finishers in Gor, including most notably Simen Nordahl who was suffering with a terrible saddle sore and Jesse Yates who said his head wasn't quite in it." - Chris Tonge (https://bikepacking.com/tracker/badlands-2024/)

**Heat-Related Crisis - James [ELITE]:** "By the second half of the day, the temperature was beginning to take its toll. I was vomiting and unable to keep anything down, my feet and hands were getting blisters, everything in my head was echoing. It wasn't until I literally fell asleep on my bike and veered off the track that I decided to stop. I was so close to scratching at that point." Recovered with 45-minute nap. (https://www.voomnutrition.co.uk/blog/badlands-race-report-the-worlds-most-brutal-gravel-race/)

**Saddle Sores:** "Saddle sores were a major issue." - James [ELITE]. Simen Nordahl [ELITE] DNF'd specifically due to "terrible saddle sore." (https://www.voomnutrition.co.uk/blog/badlands-race-report-the-worlds-most-brutal-gravel-race/ and https://bikepacking.com/tracker/badlands-2024/)

**Insufficient Recovery - Chris Hall [UNKNOWN]:** "The gap between finishing the perimeter of Britain project and Badlands was just over 1 week. I think I always knew it was a big ask to be able to complete both especially when I was so fatigued... No matter how much I ate or drank I just had zero energy." DNF'd day two. (https://www.siestacampers.com/blog/badlands-gravel-challenge)

**Shifting/Mechanical Issues - Cara [ELITE]:** Referenced last year's challenge: "last year with the stress I was under from chasing, and shifting issues making my largest cassette cog unusable, this climb was a much bigger challenge." (https://gravgrav.cc/en/article/badlands-2024-race-report)

**Late-Race Puncture Risk:** "8 km from Capileira my tyre punctured, a big slice down my sidewall from my overeagerness to finish." - Cara Dixon [ELITE], who still finished first woman despite this. (https://gravgrav.cc/en/article/badlands-2024-race-report)

**Gravel-Induced Problems - Bradley [COMPETITIVE]:** "Heavy rain on gritty trails was causing problems with the bike, the temperature, the ground conditions, and my anatomy." (https://road.cc/offroad/content/feature/badlands-2023-my-epic-journey-through-europes-toughest-gravel-race-13439)

**Mental Breaking Point - James [ELITE]:** "Was I ever going to reach the finish? By late afternoon I had reached the foothills of La Alpujarra... The tank was empty. I sat on the side of the road, my head in my hands, wondering where I could pull the reserves from to get me to the end." Saved by local woman with sandwich. (https://www.voomnutrition.co.uk/blog/badlands-race-report-the-worlds-most-brutal-gravel-race/)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Gor Village Support:** "Arriving in Gor was such a special moment and something I will cherish forever. Music is pumping, the village is out for support and Santiago is there with his trusty handycam to capture it all." - Bradley Shenton [COMPETITIVE] (https://road.cc/offroad/content/feature/badlands-2023-my-epic-journey-through-europes-toughest-gravel-race-13439)

**Gor Resupply Support:** "The event organisers had agreed with a cafe in Gor to open for 24 hours for the riders, which proved to be invaluable." - Bradley [COMPETITIVE] (https://road.cc/offroad/content/feature/badlands-2023-my-epic-journey-through-europes-toughest-gravel-race-13439)

**Cara's Welcome:** "Gor felt like an oasis, the flowing water fountains drawing in every racer the moment they entered the town. Arriving there to cheers of my name and the whole town seemingly there to celebrate the race made it feel like I had finished, but we were only 230 into a 790 km route." - Cara Dixon [ELITE] (https://gravgrav.cc/en/article/badlands-2024-race-report)

**Local Kindness - James [ELITE]:** "A lady came out of her house, with a tray and put it down beside me. A jug of water, a ham and cheese sandwich and a bag of crisps. I struggled
