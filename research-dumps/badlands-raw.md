### The Genesis Story
The idea emerged from conversations: "Hey, I've been riding that amazing area in Granada, the Gorafe Desert. What about a gravel race through the three deserts of Andalucia?" followed by "Great. And what if we add 40 km along the beach, and an epic finale after climbing the snowfields of Veleta beyond 3,000m?"

### First Edition (2020)
- 102 competitors from 13 different countries
- Participants from Canada, New Zealand, Peru demonstrating global reach
- Winner: Lachlan Morton (finished in just under 44 hours, 15 hours ahead of second place)

## 6. BLACK PILL

### The Uncomfortable Truths About Badlands

#### DNF Rates
| Year | Started | Scratched/DNF | Finish Rate |
|------|---------|---------------|-------------|
| 2022 | 237 | 35 (15%) | 68% (161 finished) |
| 2024 | ~300 | ~91 (30%) | 69.7% |
| 2025 | ~350 | 46+ DNF | Similar pattern |

**Roughly 30% of starters do not finish.**

#### Primary DNF Causes
1. **Heat/Heatstroke** - #1 cause, especially Day 1
2. Mechanical failures
3. Falls and crashes
4. Sickness
5. Severe fatigue/sleep deprivation

#### The Gorafe Graveyard
"The village of Gor is where Badlands started to take its victims. Of the first front 12 riders that arrived in Gor, only six or so finished the race."

#### Heat Reality
- 40C+ by mid-morning is normal
- 43C reported at checkpoints
- "The humidity was so high this year, which you just don't get in Spain... the UV was high - the sun just felt hotter, and with the humidity you can't cool down"
- Some riders suffer beginnings of heatstroke
- Multiple heat-related medical withdrawals each year

#### Water Scarcity
- 100km+ stretches with no water
- Water security is a serious concern
- Must carry 5L capacity and use it strategically
- Bars/villages may be closed during hottest hours (siesta)

#### The "Vampire" Strategy
- Only realistic finish strategy for many: ride at night, rest in heat
- Creates severe sleep deprivation
- "Sleep deprivation eventually takes its toll"
- Hallucinations reported by some riders

#### Hike-a-Bike Reality
- Multiple mandatory pushing sections
- 18km climb sections that take 5 hours (mostly pushing)
- Sandy beach sections impossible to ride
- High altitude gravel sections require walking
- Not optional - everyone pushes at some point

#### Navigation Challenges
- Self-navigation required
- Remote terrain with few landmarks
- Easy to miss turns in desert/beach sections
- GPS device essential (no phone signal in many areas)

#### Registration Lottery
- Demand exceeds spots by 5x
- Application-based system means you might not get in
- No guaranteed entry even for returning finishers

#### Cost Reality
- 295 EUR entry fee
- Plus flights to Spain
- Accommodation before/after
- Bike shipping or rental
- Equipment upgrades
- Total easily exceeds 1,000 EUR

#### Physical Demands
- "The route requires very good fitness and advanced riding skills"
- 16,000m+ climbing in 5 days max
- Heat compounds physical stress exponentially
- Technical skills needed for rocky descents

#### It's Not Actually a "Race"
- Officially "not a race" with "no rankings or prizes"
- "A personal adventure where you must complete the route by yourself"
- Times tracked but no prize money
- Can feel anticlimactic for competitive types

## 8. SUGGESTED GRAVEL GOD RATINGS

### Rating Scale: 1 (Easy/Low) to 5 (Extreme/High)

| Category | Rating | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| **Logistics** | 3/5 | Granada well-served by airports; good infrastructure; bike transport manageable but requires planning; Spain generally easy to navigate |
| **Length** | 5/5 | 800km is ultra-distance territory; 5-day cutoff; one of longest gravel events globally; requires multi-day self-sufficiency |
| **Technicality** | 4/5 | Mandatory hike-a-bike; sandy beach sections; rocky descents; desert navigation; varied surface types; not pure technical MTB but demands skills |
| **Elevation** | 5/5 | 16,000m+ total gain; includes Europe's highest paved road (Pico Veleta 3,396m); steep gradients (25%+ sections); relentless climbing |
| **Climate** | 5/5 | Extreme heat (40C+); desert conditions; UV exposure; temperature swings (40C day to 0C night at altitude); dehydration risk; primary DNF factor |
| **Altitude** | 4/5 | Pico Veleta reaches 3,396m; significant time above 2,000m; altitude affects performance; not Himalayan but substantial for European event |
| **Adventure** | 5/5 | Europe's only deserts; wild Mediterranean coast; abandoned villages; film-location landscapes; truly unique and remote; "wildest gravel challenge in Europe" claim justified |

### Overall Difficulty Assessment
**EXTREME** - This is not a beginner-friendly event. The combination of distance, elevation, heat, and self-sufficiency requirements places Badlands among the most challenging gravel events globally. The 30% DNF rate reflects genuine difficulty.

### Ideal Participant Profile
- Experienced ultra-distance cyclist
- Heat-tolerant or prepared for heat management
- Strong climbing ability
- Self-sufficient mindset
- Good navigation skills
- Comfortable with hike-a-bike
- Can function on minimal sleep

### Comparison Context
- More challenging than: Belgian Waffle Ride, Unbound Gravel, Dirty Kanza
- Comparable to: Atlas Mountain Race, Silk Road Mountain Race (shorter but similar intensity)
- Less extreme than: Tour Divide, Trans Am (in pure distance)
