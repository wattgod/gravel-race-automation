# BALD EAGLE GRAVEL GRINDER — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Nancy Mizak [UNKNOWN]:** "Answering the BaseCamp challenge of doing something that kinda scares you....I chose to enter the Bald Eagle Gravel Grinder in the PA Gravel Series not knowing it was the the toughest in terms of climbing. What an incredible experience to put all the training and coaching to work... I did so much better than I thought I would, so much of what I learned this past BaseCamp was utilized throughout the race. Knowing the first hill climb came at the start of the race, I kept to the plan of not going hard so I didn't burn too many candles....at first it left me feeling defeated as I found myself in the usual position of in the rear riding alone but I stuck to the plan. The closest two guys around me would always blow by me in the downhills, but much to my surprise, I would catch up and pass them on the climbs." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/nancy-s-story-bald-eagle-gravel-grinder)

**Nancy Mizak [UNKNOWN] continued:** "At the end of the race, one of those guys joined me for lunch and gave me the compliment that made the whole experience even sweeter when he said, 'After you passed me on the 5th climb, you just kept climbing stronger and stronger then disappeared.' I had stuck to the plan....climbs 5 & 6 were the last hills, and I would give what ever I had left in the tank. I had two SAIL moments that didn't stop me but made me stop, think, and find a way to fix. Because of the the SAIL moments, I didn't take time to stop and take more than one picture; however, I did consciously take the time to soak in all the incredible beauty around me during the entire ride. Because it had rained quite a bit in the past weeks, the water in the streams along the route were running fast, clear and simply beautiful....oh, and then there was the weather....perfect!"

**Lynn Botelho [RECREATIONAL]:** "My first race of the Trans-Sylvania Productions gravel series and my first win! I really could tell that my winter training made the difference. Felt fit and prepared, and I remembered to attack on the penultimate hill to pass and gap the then leader." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/lynns-story-bald-eagle-gravel-grinder)

**Amy Fowler [ELITE]:** "Today team Basecamp members Allie Pope Burger, Nancy Mizak, and myself tackled the Bald Eagle Gravel Grinder in Spring Mills, PA. There was a lot of SAILing going on in the first race of the season. I had one goal, to improve my time from last year. I ended up finishing 20+ mins slower. While this was very disappointing, this race has a lot of challenges. First was the weather, we were expecting partly sunny with a high of 70°. Instead we had full sun and a high of 82°! I cramped twice, one I had to walk out and the other I was able to pedal out, but this slowed me down quite a bit. With the first climb starting within the first half mile, my legs decided they had enough and never came around. Every pedal stroke uphill felt like a fight." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/amy-s-story-bald-eagle-gravel-grinder)

**Amy Fowler [ELITE] continued:** "That being said, I did get a number of PRs and I tried a few changes in my race setup. Some worked, some didn't. I kept moving forward, went hard where I could, and ended up on the podium. Overall, I felt like crap all day but it was great being back racing."

**Iluvgr8tdeals [UNKNOWN] - Poseidon Redwood Stock Bike:** "I finished the Bald Eagle Gravel Grinder Gravel Bike race in Spring Mills PA on Sunday. (4/14/2024) I just bought the Poseidon Redwood gravel bicycle during their 'last call' clearance sale... I put it together and used a torque wrench to tighten the bolts as per the torque specs. The only thing I changed was the saddle... The bicycle rode well during the race. Changing gears went smoothly and the largest gear worked well in this extremely hilly race. I signed up for the 50-ish mile race (there is an 80-mile 'full' race) and I can't complain about the bicycle. It's a 10 speed and maybe if all you ride is hills, a 12 speed cassette (and other parts of the crankset) change would be in order. The bolt for the saddle became loose during the race but once I tightened it stayed put... If it can finish a gravel bike race right out of the box, then it's a pretty decent gravel bike." (https://www.reddit.com/r/PoseidonBikes/comments/1c5wcoc/finished_a_50_mile_gravel_bike_race_with_a_stock/)

**Tom & Peter Meersman [COMPETITIVE] - Trans-Sylvania Stage Race Day 1 (includes BEGG course):** "As a 'flatlander' coming from the Midwest I figured the cyclocross friendly 46-36 gearing setup on my front crankset would be sufficient for the climbs in Pennsylvania. Big mistake. It wasn't before the neutral rollout was finished that I already had a sinking feeling in my stomach. As we climbed our bikes out of camp I looked down at my rear cassette and realized that I had made a grave miscalculation. Despite the Midwest friendly climbing setup, my 10-26 gearing in the rear cassette was already maxed-out as we pedaled out of camp." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/trans-sylvania-gravel-epic-proves-to-be-an-epic-awesome-challenge-by-tom-meersman-peter-meersman/)

**Tom & Peter Meersman [COMPETITIVE] continued:** "After surviving the taxing early climbs, we were greeted mid-ride with a short water stop with friendly locals dispensing both hydration and encouragement. After refueling both physically and mentally, both my brother and I were confident the day couldn't get much harder. Then I was introduced to a term I had never heard 'Jeep road'. This uphill climb featured some of the gnarliest gravel inclines coupled with a treacherous rock-strewn path up the mountain- amongst the most difficult that we have both ever encountered. Attempts to dart back-and-forth to find the best line up the climb had racers take diagonal lines across the trail like ping-pong balls the entire ascent. Upon discovering that there was no good line up the trail, most of us lost so much momentum we ended up dismounted and running up the steepest sections just as fast as riding!"

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**[COMPETITIVE] Gearing - Critical Lesson:** Tom Meersman ran 46-36 front with 10-26 rear cassette and was "maxed-out" on climbs even during the neutral rollout. He had to find a local bike shop (Bike Roost in Boalsburg, PA) to upgrade to a larger cassette for subsequent days. His advice: "Mercifully, I had found a local bike shop that had a larger rear cassette for purchase, providing more appropriate gearing for Stage 2... at least an appropriate mechanical setup for the days to come." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/trans-sylvania-gravel-epic-proves-to-be-an-epic-awesome-challenge-by-tom-meersman-peter-meersman/)

**[UNKNOWN] Budget Bike Viability:** Poseidon Redwood with stock 10-speed drivetrain completed the 50-mile Half Series. Rider notes: "It's a 10 speed and maybe if all you ride is hills, a 12 speed cassette (and other parts of the crankset) change would be in order." However, they also noted: "The bolt for the saddle became loose during the race but once I tightened it stayed put." (https://www.reddit.com/r/PoseidonBikes/comments/1c5wcoc/finished_a_50_mile_gravel_bike_race_with_a_stock/)

**[UNKNOWN] Brake Setup Issue:** Poseidon Redwood rider experienced rotor rub: "I had a nightmare with the brake rotors squealing as they hit the brake pads but I googled some YouTube videos on how to solve this... I took a piece of paper, cut a 1 by 3 inch piece and folded it into 2. I then loosened the 2 bolts holding the brake pads and then placed the folded paper between the brake rotor and the brake pads. I used a zip tie to clinch the brake lever and then tightened the bolts." (https://www.reddit.com/r/PoseidonBikes/comments/1c5wcoc/finished_a_50_mile_gravel_bike_race_with_a_stock/)

**[UNKNOWN] Saddle Choice:** Nancy Mizak replaced stock saddle with "a Fizik Aliante Tempo saddle. (The 'older' version.) Not that there is anything wrong with the Poseidon saddle but saddles are personal and I like a saddle with an anatomic/ergonomic hollow or recessed cutout/area." (https://www.reddit.com/r/PoseidonBikes/comments/1c5wcoc/finished_a_50_mile_gravel_bike_race_with_a_stock/)

## Weather Experienced

**2024 - Extreme Heat:** Amy Fowler reported: "First was the weather, we were expecting partly sunny with a high of 70°. Instead we had full sun and a high of 82°! I cramped twice, one I had to walk out and the other I was able to pedal out, but this slowed me down quite a bit." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/amy-s-story-bald-eagle-gravel-grinder)

**2025 - Perfect Conditions:** Nancy Mizak noted: "Because it had rained quite a bit in the past weeks, the water in the streams along the route were running fast, clear and simply beautiful....oh, and then there was the weather....perfect!" (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/nancy-s-story-bald-eagle-gravel-grinder)

**Trans-Sylvania Stage 2 - Threatened Rain:** "While the skies were overcast and threatened rain at the start line, after a few scattered raindrops in the early miles, clouds passed and the sun came out for the remainder of the day." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/trans-sylvania-gravel-epic-proves-to-be-an-epic-awesome-challenge-by-tom-meersman-peter-meersman/)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Immediate Climbing:** Multiple sources confirm the climb starts almost immediately. Amy Fowler: "With the first climb starting within the first half mile, my legs decided they had enough and never came around." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/amy-s-story-bald-eagle-gravel-grinder)

Tom Meersman: "It wasn't before the neutral rollout was finished that I already had a sinking feeling in my stomach. As we climbed our bikes out of camp I looked down at my rear cassette and realized that I had made a grave miscalculation." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/trans-sylvania-gravel-epic-proves-to-be-an-epic-awesome-challenge-by-tom-meersman-peter-meersman/)

**"Jeep Road" Sections:** Tom Meersman describes encountering this terrain type: "Then I was introduced to a term I had never heard 'Jeep road'. This uphill climb featured some of the gnarliest gravel inclines coupled with a treacherous rock-strewn path up the mountain- amongst the most difficult that we have both ever encountered. Attempts to dart back-and-forth to find the best line up the climb had racers take diagonal lines across the trail like ping-pong balls the entire ascent. Upon discovering that there was no good line up the trail, most of us lost so much momentum we ended up dismounted and running up the steepest sections just as fast as riding!" (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/trans-sylvania-gravel-epic-proves-to-be-an-epic-awesome-challenge-by-tom-meersman-peter-meersman/)

**Jeep Road Descents:** "While Jeep Road descents are a bit easier on the legs, they are just as perilous! ...Stage 2 contained another white-knuckling long Jeep-road descent that had both my brother and I praying to the Bike Gods to spare us from crashing and flatting." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/trans-sylvania-gravel-epic-proves-to-be-an-epic-awesome-challenge-by-tom-meersman-peter-meersman/)

**Critical Climb Sequence:** Nancy Mizak references specific numbered climbs: "climbs 5 & 6 were the last hills, and I would give what ever I had left in the tank." This suggests the course has at least 6 major named/notable climbs. (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/nancy-s-story-bald-eagle-gravel-grinder)

**Scenic Elements:** Nancy Mizak: "Because it had rained quite a bit in the past weeks, the water in the streams along the route were running fast, clear and simply beautiful." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/nancy-s-story-bald-eagle-gravel-grinder)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**[UNKNOWN/RECREATIONAL] Conservative Early Pacing:** Nancy Mizak describes her strategy: "Knowing the first hill climb came at the start of the race, I kept to the plan of not going hard so I didn't burn too many candles....at first it left me feeling defeated as I found myself in the usual position of in the rear riding alone but I stuck to the plan. The closest two guys around me would always blow by me in the downhills, but much to my surprise, I would catch up and pass them on the climbs." She saved energy for climbs 5 & 6: "climbs 5 & 6 were the last hills, and I would give what ever I had left in the tank." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/nancy-s-story-bald-eagle-gravel-grinder)

**[RECREATIONAL] Attacking Strategy for Winners:** Lynn Botelho: "I remembered to attack on the penultimate hill to pass and gap the then leader." This suggests the second-to-last major climb is a key tactical point for making decisive moves. (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/lynns-story-bald-eagle-gravel-grinder)

**[ELITE] Heat Management Failure:** Amy Fowler's experience shows even elite riders can struggle with unexpected conditions: "we were expecting partly sunny with a high of 70°. Instead we had full sun and a high of 82°! I cramped twice, one I had to walk out and the other I was able to pedal out." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/amy-s-story-bald-eagle-gravel-grinder)

**Climbing vs. Descending Trade-offs:** Nancy Mizak noted she was slower on descents but made up time climbing: "The closest two guys around me would always blow by me in the downhills, but much to my surprise, I would catch up and pass them on the climbs." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/nancy-s-story-bald-evening-gravel-grinder)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Inadequate Gearing:** Tom Meersman nearly faced a DNF due to gearing choice. His 10-26 rear cassette "was already maxed-out as we pedaled out of camp." He required an emergency bike shop visit to continue the multi-day event. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/trans-sylvania-gravel-epic-proves-to-be-an-epic-awesome-challenge-by-tom-meersman-peter-meersman/)

**Cramping from Heat:** Amy Fowler cramped twice in unexpected 82°F heat despite being an elite-level rider: "I cramped twice, one I had to walk out and the other I was able to pedal out, but this slowed me down quite a bit." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/amy-s-story-bald-eagle-gravel-grinder)

**Mechanical Issues:** The Poseidon Redwood rider experienced saddle bolt loosening during the race, requiring a mid-race stop to tighten. (https://www.reddit.com/r/PoseidonBikes/comments/1c5wcoc/finished_a_50_mile_gravel_bike_race_with_a_stock/)

**Early Pacing Errors:** Amy Fowler notes: "With the first climb starting within the first half mile, my legs decided they had enough and never came around. Every pedal stroke uphill felt like a fight." Even elite riders can blow up early on this course. (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/amy-s-story-bald-eagle-gravel-grinder)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**"Gravel Summer Camp" Vibe:** Tom Meersman describes the Trans-Sylvania multi-day event (which includes BEGG): "Since everyone was staying onsite or near the finish line and we all had extra time to hangout, the group of finishers slowly growing as we swapped tales of climbing, descending, and navigating some of the more harrowing components of the days race. We were already beginning to realize why this race has been dubbed Gravel Summer Camp." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/trans-sylvania-gravel-epic-proves-to-be-an-epic-awesome-challenge-by-tom-meersman-peter-meersman/)

**On-Site Camping at Seven Mountains Scout Camp:** "All entrants into the Gravel Epic have the option for onsite housing, whether it be in a tent, RV, or cabin, taking the challenge of travel to the morning start line out of the equation. Opting to stay in a cabin at the Seven Mountains Scout camp proved clutch, as we were literally a 60 second soft-pedal away from the staging area." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/trans-sylvania-gravel-epic-proves-to-be-an-epic-awesome-challenge-by-tom-meersman-peter-meersman/)

**Post-Race Support:** "At the finish of each stage is an table filled with PB&J (peanut butter & jelly ((jam)) sandwiches for those unaware), watermelon, giant coolers of recovery drink, and ice-cold Coca-Cola." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/trans-sylvania-gravel-epic-proves-to-be-an-epic-awesome-challenge-by-tom-meersman-peter-meersman/)

**Included Meals:** "Race registration also features a generous onsite breakfast and dinner at the lodge (also race HQ), award ceremony, and stage preview for the following day. This proved an invaluable way to prep for the next day of racing and further opportunity to get to know the other gravel racers, again adding to the Gravel Summer Camp experience." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/trans-sylvania-gravel-epic-proves-to-be-an-epic-awesome-challenge-by-tom-meersman-peter-meersman/)

**Neutral Rollout:** "Another unique component of the Gravel Epic is that each stage starts with a neutral rollout, led out of camp by the race director as he ushered the peloton a few miles to the start of the race. This was a small but well-placed detail that added to the grand tour like feel of this event." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/trans-sylvania-gravel-epic-proves-to-be-an-epic-awesome-challenge-by-tom-meersman-peter-meersman/)

**Aid Station Quality:** "Another pleasant sight along the way were the well-stocked aid stations, one for short coursers and two for long-course riders during each stage. Having several volunteers along the way at key turns and at aid stations provided a truly seamless racing experience." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/trans-sylvania-gravel-epic-proves-to-be-an-epic-awesome-challenge-by-tom-meersman-peter-meersman/)

**Local Support:** Tom Meersman notes: "After surviving the taxing early climbs, we were greeted mid-ride with a short water stop with friendly locals dispensing both hydration and encouragement." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/trans-sylvania-gravel-epic-proves-to-be-an-epic-awesome-challenge-by-tom-meersman-peter-meersman/)

**Post-Race Compliments:** Nancy Mizak shares: "At the end of the race, one of those guys joined me for lunch and gave me the compliment that made the whole experience even sweeter when he said, 'After you passed me on the 5th climb, you just kept climbing stronger and stronger then disappeared.'"
