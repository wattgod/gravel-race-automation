# BALKAN GRAVEL — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Justinas Leveika [ELITE]:** "The bike is a very fast one and I love it. Trek gave it to me and said go have fun, so that's what I did! 🤩" (https://escapecollective.com/a-winning-trek-that-suggests-full-suspension-gravel-bikes-are-coming-back/)
- Won the 2025 Trans Balkan Race with fastest known time of just over 4 days on a full-suspension prototype Trek

**Leanne Bentley [ELITE]:** On her setup: "The combo of the Albion UL insulated jacket and Primaloft body warmer, which should see me through a wide range of temperatures. I'll also once again be running a kLite dynamo light and charger." (https://bikepacking.com/bikes/rigs-of-the-2025-trans-balkan-race/)

**Martin Moschek [UNKNOWN]:** "After last year's Bohemian Border Bash Race, I've adopted a different strategy for this year: enjoy the scenery and the ride more, ride less empty, take more care of myself. And I'm sure I'll do pretty well with that." (https://www.biketour-global.de/en/2024/05/26/my-next-adventure-trans-balkan-race-2024/)
- Originally planned 6 days for the route, had up to 9 days available

**Golo [UNKNOWN]:** "Die Leute vom Hotel raten ab, weil schlechte Straße, unbewohnt, Kriegsschäden, Bären, Wölfe und Wildschweine etc." [Hotel staff warned against the direct route over Pass Karaula due to bad roads, uninhabited areas, war damage, bears, wolves and wild boars] — but then reported: "Dieser Ratschlag macht (vor allem mich) noch neugieriger und wir fahren die schlussendlich sehr gut zu fahrende und auch nicht steile Naturstrasse über den 1180 m hohen Pass Karaula." [This advice made us more curious and we rode the ultimately very rideable and not steep natural road over the 1180m Pass Karaula] (https://bikeboard.at/forum/topic/262848-balkan-gravel/)

**Valerio Cecchi [ELITE]:** On navigation and safety: "You should pay particular attention to the minefields, which are clearly indicated in the road book. A distinction is made here between 'Warning of mines' and 'High Danger'. You should avoid travelling through at night (although this will not always be possible) and in any case you should stay on the track and not bivouac or take a break off the trail."

- Higher difficulty races (orange category) have 3,000-3,500m/100km

## DNF Risk Factors

**Minefield Danger Zones:**
Clear markings in roadbook distinguish between "Warning of mines" and "High Danger" areas. Critical safety rules: avoid traveling through at night when possible, stay on track, do not bivouac or take breaks off the trail. (https://bikepacking.com/bikes/rigs-of-the-2025-trans-balkan-race/)

**Environmental Challenges:**
- "Long, remote sections" with "limited water access" (https://bikepacking.com/bikes/rigs-of-the-2025-trans-balkan-race/)

- Temperature swings of 20°C in just a couple hours in karst areas (https://www.bombtrack.com/events-database/tbr2025)
- "Flourishing forests, where paths are often muddy and slippery" (https://www.bombtrack.com/bikes/rigs-of-the-2025-trans-balkan-race/)

**Mental Challenge:**
The final 340km with 6,700m climbing after already having 1,000km and 20,000m in the legs described as "a good test of character." (https://www.biketour-global.de/en/2024/05/26/my-next-adventure-trans-balkan-race-2024/)

**Cultural Context:**
"In the common imagination, the simultaneous proximity and distance of the Balkans depict an exotic 'other' Europe. It evokes images of war, chaos, and wild territories. Yet, these memories left today an enigmatic region, ready to be explored." (https://bikepacking.com/bikes/rigs-of-the-2025-trans-balkan-race/)

**Photo Documentation:**
"The organizers at Exploro.cc brought in photographer Giuliano Koren to capture the riders' rigs photos before the event started" - became a tradition in recent years. (https://bikepacking.com/bikes/rigs-of-the-2025-trans-balkan-race/)

**On-Ground Support:**
Organizers note "The organization does not provide any support – other than two supervised Checkpoints and GPS tracking to follow the race." (https://www.bombtrack.com/events-database/tbr2025)

**Language & Locals (from Golo's touring experience [UNKNOWN]):**
- Older people often speak German, younger people speak good English
- Communication with non-English speakers possible with hands and feet
- "Die Leute hier auch relativ gut Englisch und Deutsch" [People here speak relatively good English and German]
