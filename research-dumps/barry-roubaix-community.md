# BARRY-ROUBAIX KILLER GRAVEL ROAD RACE — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Jorden Wakeley [ELITE]:** "Snow, wind, cold and wind were the name of the game today. Broke away with 100K to go with last years winner, Connor Kamm, and stuck it all the way to the finish." (https://www.granfondoguide.com/Contents/Index/6587/thousands-complete-americas-largest-gravel-race-in-freezing-conditions)

**Anonymous rider [UNKNOWN]:** "Around mile 18, my quads started to cramp. I wracked my brain trying to remember if cramps were a sign of low electrolytes or dehydration. I shifted into an easier gear, ate another shot block, drank and kept going." (https://eattriventure.posthaven.com/barry-roubaix-race-report)

**Anonymous rider [UNKNOWN]:** "The hardest part was navigating other racers and choosing the correct body to get behind on the longer, steeper, wetter climbs. At one point on one of the longer climbs, I could hear the gentleman in front of me, grinding through his gears as we neared the top of a sloppy section. I thought for sure he was going to drop a chain and in the process drop me in the mud." (https://eattriventure.posthaven.com/barry-roubaix-race-report)

**Anonymous rider [UNKNOWN]:** "I had positioned myself poorly once again. This time, it was like the last day of the Tour de France with everyone out for a leisurely group ride. I suspect that about ten girls got off the front in a couple of packs and the rest of us were left behind in traffic." (https://eattriventure.posthaven.com/barry-roubaix-race-report)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Mountain Bike vs. Cyclocross [UNKNOWN level rider]:** After test riding both bikes, chose mountain bike for two key reasons: "First, my mountain bike has a granny gear. Although there aren't any long climbs on the 24 mile loop, there is a lot of climbing. I was working way too hard on my test ride with the gearing on my cross bike. Second, my cross bike is relatively new. While I had ridden it some this winter, I had not ridden it in the conditions which were presenting for the race (i.e. running water and peanut butter dirt on some of the climbs). I knew I would be more confident on my trusty Kona 2+2." Partner also opted for mountain bike based on conditions advice. (https://eattriventure.posthaven.com/barry-roubaix-race-report)

**Bike types observed [UNKNOWN]:** "Looking around, I did notice that most of my wave compatriots (all 24 mile females plus some youth categories) were on mountain bikes." (https://eattriventure.posthaven.com/barry-roubaix-race-report)

**Suspension setup [UNKNOWN]:** "I locked out the front fork. With the non-technical terrain, the Kona's full suspension would be working against me to a certain degree." (https://eattriventure.posthaven.com/barry-roubaix-race-report)

**General bike variety [ELITE source]:** "Participants use a variety of bicycle types (cyclocross, mountain, road, fat), depending on course conditions and individual preferences." (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry-Roubaix)

(https://eattriventure.posthaven.com/barry-roubaix-race-report)

**Climbing character [UNKNOWN]:** "Although there aren't any long climbs on the 24 mile loop, there is a lot of climbing." (https://eattriventure.posthaven.com/barry-roubaix-race-report)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Start positioning matters [UNKNOWN]:** "At Ice Man, I found myself pushed to the front while we were lining up and got spit out the back during the very fast start. So I did not want a repeat of that... Unfortunately, I had positioned myself poorly once again. This time, it was like the last day of the Tour de France with everyone out for a leisurely group ride. I suspect that about ten girls got off the front in a couple of packs and the rest of us were left behind in traffic." Lesson: "I just stayed to the left and passed people." (https://eattriventure.posthaven.com/barry-roubaix-race-report)

**Early breakaways can work [ELITE]:** "In both the men's and women's 62 mile Open Category races, early breakaways defined the outcome of the day" in 2015. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry-Roubaix)

## Nutrition & Hydration

**Nutrition example [UNKNOWN, 24-mile race]:** "For nutrition, I sucked on Clif shot blocks with caffeine. I had approximately sixty ounces of water on me in my Camelbak. Ultimately, I drank about forty ounces, which may not have been enough. Around mile 18, my quads started to cramp. I wracked my brain trying to remember if cramps were a sign of low electrolytes or dehydration." (https://eattriventure.posthaven.com/barry-roubaix-race-report)

**Pre-race breakfast [UNKNOWN]:** "Breakfast consisted of oatmeal with slivered almonds and raisins and coffee, courtesy of the hotel breakfast bar. I also brought a small container of roasted sunflower seeds and PB2 to add some more oomph to my oatmeal... I grabbed an apple and a banana for the road... I ate my banana and killed some more time in the car until it was time to hit the POPs and line up." (https://eattriventure.posthaven.com/barry-roubaix-race-report)
