## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Grahame Rivers [COMPETITIVE]:** "Battenkill is the hardest race I've ever done. Period. Everything about Battenkill was hard... I had failed to recognize that Battenkill is a war of attrition. I had put all my cards on the table and lost... I've never been so desperate for a race to be over." (https://pedalmag.com/tour-of-the-battenkill-race-report-full-results/)

**Grahame Rivers [COMPETITIVE]:** "Rain the night before had changed the dirt roads to the constancy of peanut butter which had the peloton strung out immediately... on one steep muddy hill, the pace from struggling riders became so slow that much of the peloton was forced to dismount, with many riders running their bikes up the hill." (https://pedalmag.com/tour-of-the-battenkill-race-report-full-results/)

**Grahame Rivers [COMPETITIVE]:** On his breakaway attempt: "We were away for close to 60km... the support vehicle pulled up and informed us that we had a 5-minute lead on the peloton. We looked around at each other and laughed with joy. We were going to win this race!" [But then] "We turned the corner and hit feedzone one. We were only at the first of two feedzones! At that point I knew I was already pretty much cooked." (https://pedalmag.com/tour-of-the-battenkill-race-report-full-results/)

**Scott Fitzgerald [COMPETITIVE]:** Described Grahame's breakaway attempt as a "kamikaze move." (https://pedalmag.com/tour-of-the-battenkill-race-report-full-results/)

**Dan McCausland [ELITE]:** "It was with 10 miles or so to go, heading downhill across beautiful country in a small but solid group of guys working pretty well together... that it dawned on me... just how good a day I was having... the Tour of the Battenkill Gran Fondo is up there with the best days I have ever had on a bike." (https://www.granfondo.com/featured-granfondo/517823/battenkill-gran-fondo-delivers-a-classic-experience)

**Dan McCausland [ELITE]:** "The arrows on the road, signs and marshals (part of a team 400 strong) at every intersection meant that there was no chance of getting lost... Cyclists had priority everywhere with police officers or sheriffs at major intersections to halt traffic. As I ignored the feed stops it meant I did not unclip at any point in the ride." (https://www.granfondo.com/featured-granfondo/517823/battenkill-gran-fondo-delivers-a-classic-experience)

**Dan McCausland [ELITE]:** "The quote of the day was heard on the gravel of Juniper Swamp Road: '300 watts and 4 miles per hour...' That was more down to the slope than the surface." (https://www.granfondo.com/featured-granfondo/517823/battenkill-gran-fondo-delivers-a-classic-experience)

**Somervillain [ELITE]:** "I had done only one long ride this season... so I wasn't in good enough shape to tackle a mountainous ride of too much distance... Typically my Catskills routes average 1000 ft of elevation gain per 10 miles, but 6200 ft would be too much this early in the year — that's like D2R2, a ride I spend all summer preparing for!" (https://ridingthecatskills.com/page/5/)

**John S (globecanvas) [ELITE]:** "I'm 10 pounds too heavy (or 20 watts too weak) to compete in races that are decided by raw watts per kilogram... In all races featuring a climb of more than 10 minutes, my best result is 22nd place, with two DNFs. In all races where the longest climb is less than 10 minutes, my worst result is 8th place, with five podiums." (https://ridingthecatskills.com/page/5/)

**queerpunk (mattio) [UNKNOWN]:** "Run what ya brung. I did it last year on 21/23mm tubulars and the year before on 23mm clinchers. Last year the unpaved roads were smoother than the paved ones. It's not exactly Arenberg." (https://www.bikeforums.net/33-road-bike-racing/716381-battenkill-tires.html)

**Dieter Drake (founder/organizer) [ELITE]:** "Battenkill was doing gravel before gravel was cool. To bring it back now, when mixed-surface riding has exploded globally – the timing couldn't be better." (https://vergesport.com/blogs/news/battenkill-gravel-race-custom-cycling-jerseys)

**Dylan Seguin (Team CLIF Bar manager) [ELITE]:** On why they brought crit specialists to Battenkill: "Quite simply, it's rad... one of the main objectives for this season-long project is to feature some of the best races that the United States has to offer. And while Battenkill is not at all suited to crit specialists, the race's special place on most people's bucket lists, the unique parcours, the gravel, the level of competition and the personalities involved make it a must-do."

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Tire Consensus [MIXED LEVELS]:** Multiple riders confirm standard road tires work fine:
- **Matt2.8NJ [UNKNOWN]:** "You won't need 25's for Battenkill. Just run your regular tires." (https://www.bikeforums.net/33-road-bike-racing/716381-battenkill-tires.html)
- **g.r.e.g. [UNKNOWN]:** "I'm originally from Schuylerville, about 15 mins from Cambridge and have ridden all the Battenkill roads many times and I've just used my GP4000 with no issues" (https://www.bikeforums.net/33-road-bike-racing/716381-battenkill-tires.html)
- **DocM [UNKNOWN]:** "If you regularly ride in the northeast, you probably ride on paved roads that are in worse shape than the dirt sections. Don't overthink it." (https://www.bikeforums.net/33-road-bike-racing/716381-battenkill-tires.html)

**Bike Choice [OFFICIAL]:** From the event organizers: "In order of faster to slower: road bike, gravel bike, mountain bike. Reverse these if you're looking to prioritize comfort. Racers will be using road bikes with 28-32mm tires, and everyone else will ride whatever they have or makes them happy." (https://anthemsportstours.com/battenkill)

**E-bikes [RECREATIONAL]:** "Can I ride an E-bike in the Gran Fondo? Absolutely. We love E-bikes. You will not be eligible for age group awards, however." (https://anthemsportstours.com/battenkill)

**Equipment Philosophy [RECREATIONAL - trrads]:** "I love my Marlin and don't want to spend the $ to get a whole new bike just for this race. I'm seeing this mostly as an opportunity to get out and push myself a bit while taking in some of the fall scenery." Response from **Saddlesaur [UNKNOWN]:** "Go with the goal finding out what's it like, having fun, and see where it takes you... On most all I've gone on I've seen a wide variety of bikes from high-dollar race bikes to hybrids, cruisers, and even unicycles in a few cases." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/the-great-north-battenkill-valley/105123)

## Weather Experienced

**2014 Race Day [ELITE - Grahame Rivers]:** "Rain the night before had changed the dirt roads to the constancy of peanut butter" (https://pedalmag.com/tour-of-the-battenkill-race-report-full-results/)

**2010 Race [ELITE - cyclingPRpro]:** "The weather played a big part this year in the UCI race, it was nasty..." (https://forum.cyclingnews.com/threads/battenkill.11476/)

**2015 Gran Fondo [ELITE - Dan McCausland]:** "The weather, the state of the legs and group dynamics are in the lap of the gods on any day... a day where the weather ranges from sunshine to rain" (https://www.granfondo.com/featured-granfondo/517823/battenkill-gran-fondo-delivers-a-classic-experience)

**2024 Spring [ELITE - Somervillain]:** "After a brutally long, cold and snowy winter, I had been itching to get back to cycling... the weather was promising to be perfect for a spring ride." (https://ridingthecatskills.com/page/5/)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Gravel Road Description [OFFICIAL]:** "There's no chunky gravel, no single track, no couches, no river crossings, no dismounting for mud or trees or anything like that. In Washington County we just call them 'dirt roads' and we've been riding them on bikes before there was anything called 'gravel.' You'll love them." (https://anthemsportstours.com/battenkill)

**Course Profile [ELITE - Dan McCausland]:** "68-mile Gran Fondo with its 12 miles of gravel in eight sections and just over 4,000 feet of climbing" (https://www.granfondo.com/featured-granfondo/517823/battenkill-gran-fondo-delivers-a-classic-experience)

**Meeting House Road [ELITE - Dan McCausland]:** "To no one's surprise, the first gravel section at Meeting House Road at around 10 miles broke things up for good" - this is described as a key selection point. (https://www.granfondo.com/featured-granfondo/517823/battenkill-gran-fondo-delivers-a-classic-experience)

**Juniper Swamp Road [ELITE - Dan McCausland]:** Steep enough that rider heard: "300 watts and 4 miles per hour" (https://www.granfondo.com/featured-granfondo/517823/battenkill-gran-fondo-delivers-a-classic-experience)

**Joe Bean Road [ELITE - Dan McCausland]:** "The big climb on Joe Bean Road just after Feed Station 2" - a major climbing section late in the race. (https://www.granfondo.com/featured-granfondo/517823/battenkill-gran-fondo-delivers-a-classic-experience)

**Becker Road [UNKNOWN]:** Video description: "This was the FAST left hander at the end of Becker Road... on their way down a ~15-18% grade loose gravel road" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRfsL3l7rxI)

**Old Schuylerville Road [ELITE - Dan McCausland]:** "The sting in the tail was we still had to climb the gravel of old Schuylerville Road... inside the last couple of miles" (https://www.granfondo.com/featured-granfondo/517823/battenkill-gran-fondo-delivers-a-classic-experience)

**Gravel Surface Conditions [ELITE - Dan McCausland]:** "The gravel sections were for the most part pretty benign and in the parallel paths swept clear of gravel by car wheels the hard-packed earth was not much different to asphalt. The squeak-inducing moments that there were came when you had to shift sides to avoid potholes or turning on and off the sections across the loose stuff." (https://www.granfondo.com/featured-granfondo/517823/battenkill-gran-fondo-delivers-a-classic-experience)

**Puncture Rate [ELITE - Dan McCausland]:** "The track pumps carried by the escorting Motorbikes saw little use. I didn't see anyone with a flat." (https://www.granfondo.com/featured-granfondo/517823/battenkill-gran-fondo-delivers-a-classic-experience)

**Steep Muddy Climbs [COMPETITIVE - Grahame Rivers]:** "On one steep muddy hill, the pace from struggling riders became so slow that much of the peloton was forced to dismount, with many riders running their bikes up the hill. My cyclocross re-mounting skills saved me on that one." (https://pedalmag.com/tour-of-the-battenkill-race-report-full-results/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Breakaway Strategy [COMPETITIVE - Grahame Rivers]:** Received advice from Anthony Sreblowski: "don't attack until the end" - which Rivers admits he didn't follow. His early breakaway attempt at 30km lasted nearly 60km before bonking: "I had made a crucial mistake before the start as I didn't set my bike computer to display the elapsed distance... I kept telling myself that the finish should be around any corner." (https://pedalmag.com/tour-of-the-battenkill-race-report-full-results/)

**War of Attrition [COMPETITIVE - Grahame Rivers]:** "I never saw the lead group again and was on my own with 20km of muddy roads and steep climbs still to come. The true cost of the breakaway came to bear. I had failed to recognize that Battenkill is a war of attrition." (https://pedalmag.com/tour-of-the-battenkill-race-report-full-results/)

**Elite Race Dynamics [ELITE - Dan McCausland]:** "The race is off... there is action right from the start! We got a split and Bennati is caught behind! The entire Puma team slips down to bring it back... It was with 10 miles or so to go, heading downhill across beautiful country in a small but solid group of guys working pretty well together, speed slowly building and legs holding up." Strategy appears to be: survive early splits, work in groups, stay fresh for late-race selections. (https://www.granfondo.com/featured-granfondo/517823/battenkill-gran-fondo-delivers-a-classic-experience)

**Break Success [ELITE - 2014 Results]:** In 2014, a breakaway of 10 riders established early (including Scheirlinckx who won). With 40km to go they had 5 min lead, which held through to the finish despite the peloton chasing hard in the final 25km. (https://pedalmag.com/tour-of-the-battenkill-race-report-full-results/)

**Group Management [ELITE - Dan McCausland]:** "The ebb and flow of the day was established. Form a group, work together taking turns to pull and collect a few loners in front of you. Then hit the next steep climb, split apart and once over the top start looking to get the band back together." (https://www.granfondo.com/featured-granfondo/517823/battenkill-gran-fondo-delivers-a-classic-experience)

**Nutrition Failure [COMPETITIVE - Grahame Rivers]:** "I ate everything I had and tried to push on to the finish. I came across the line physically destroyed." No specific carb amounts mentioned, but clear indication he ran out of fuel. (https://pedalmag.com/tour-of-the-battenkill-race-report-full-results/)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Bonking Risk [COMPETITIVE - Grahame Rivers]:** Early breakaway attempt led to complete depletion: "I was caught by the peloton and once again pride would be my downfall. Rather than finding the most sheltered spot in the group, I wanted to show I wasn't down and out; I tried to stick it out with the first ten riders. This worked until the first hill…then I was dropped like a stone." (https://pedalmag.com/tour-of-the-battenkill-race-report-full-results/)

**Attrition Rate [ELITE - 2014 Pro Race]:** "180 starters and 50 something finishers" in the UCI Pro race - approximately 72% attrition rate. (https://forum.cyclingnews.com/threads/battenkill.11476/)

**Elite Race DNFs [ELITE]:** In John S's racing season recap: "In all races featuring a climb of more than 10 minutes, my best result is 22nd place, with two DNFs" - Battenkill's long climbs can eliminate riders not suited to sustained climbing. He notes at Bear Mountain Classic (similar terrain): "I could only hold onto the two race leaders for 9 minutes before completely falling apart. I burned far too much gas too early, couldn't recover, and ended up quitting the race." (https://ridingthecatskills.com/page/5/)

**Split Risk [ELITE]:** Multiple mentions of early race splits catching strong riders out of position, including "Bennati is caught behind! The entire Puma team slips down to bring it back, but when they are 2 min behind it may be too hard?" (https://pedalmag.com/tour-of-the-battenkill-race-report-full-results/)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Local Support [COMPETITIVE - Grahame Rivers]:** "The volunteers at the race are as good as any I have seen it's like 90% of the town gets out to help." (https://pedalmag.com/tour-of-the-battenkill-race-report-full-results/)

**Organization Quality [ELITE - Dan McCausland]:** "The arrows on the road, signs and marshals (part of a team 400 strong) at every intersection meant that there was no chance of getting lost... After 11 years, Anthem has it nailed down." (https://www.granfondo.com/featured-granfondo/517823/battenkill-gran-fondo-delivers-a-classic-experience)

**Team Support [ELITE - cyclingPRpro]:** "The volunteers and organizers were awesome to work with, made everything super easy on the teams." (https://forum.cyclingnews.com/threads/battenkill.11476/)

**Grassroots Philosophy [OFFICIAL]:** "Is it a corporation-run event? No way. Grassroots cycling forever." The event is run by family-operated Anthem Sports. (https://anthemsportstours.com/battenkill)

**Community Integration [OFFICIAL]:** "The event will also include several community outreach events, fundraising opportunities for local organizations, live entertainment, food trucks, and a race expo for vendors and community groups next to the finish line in Cambridge." (https://anthemsportstours.com/battenkill)

**Expo & After Party [OFFICIAL]:** "Is there still an expo & after party? You bet. It'll be better than ever... gran fondo riders get (1) free beer & a meal voucher at the Battenkill Expo & After Party." (https://anthemsportstours.com/battenkill)

**Family Friendly [OFFICIAL]:** "Is it family friendly? Yes, it is. We'll have kids races, community-supported events at Main Street businesses, and family-friendly activities at the race expo next to the start & finish lines." (https://anthemsportstours.com/battenkill)

**Host Housing [COMPETITIVE - from Team CLIF Bar]:** "At races like these, teams often rely on host housing as local families make their homes, extra bedrooms and couches available for riders and staff... Host housing really does make the American cycling world go round. But you never really know what to expect." Their experience: families provided accommodations with WiFi (password noted as extremely complex), though quality varies. (https://velo.outsideonline.com/road/road-culture/relive-the-tour-of-the-battenkill/)

**Local Bar Experience [COMPETITIVE - Team CLIF Bar]:** "'What's the beer situation here?' The brief silence that followed signaled that this was probably not the best question to ask at this particular establishment. 'Well, we're a bar, so....' The surly waitress had already made up her mind... We did not look like we belonged." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/road/road-culture/relive-the-tour-of-the-battenkill/)

**Event Growth [VARIOUS]:** 
- 2010: 2,585 participants
- 2011: 3,093 participants  
- 2012: 3,180 participants
- 2013: 3,376 participants
- 2014: 2,740 participants
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tour_of_the_Battenkill)

**Regional Pride [OFFICIAL - Dieter Drake]:** "With our tours, we have been all over the world riding bicycles and have concluded that rural upstate New York is the best area we have ever been to ride a bike: the rural landscapes, the people & culture, and the open spaces created by centuries of agriculture & farming in this region make it a gem for road cycling."
