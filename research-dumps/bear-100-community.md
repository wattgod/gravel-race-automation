# BEAR 100 — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Steve Bremner [RECREATIONAL]:** "This race was like life itself. Ups and downs on the trail: 21,000 feet of elevation gain in a dozen or so major climbs. Ups and downs physically and psychologically: from the enthusiastic first climb in the early morning to a grueling afternoon under a hot sun... to the final death march in excruciating pain for 30 miles with a failed kidney." (https://mtnclmbr.cloud.prohosting.com/Bear100/Bear100.htm)

**Steve Bremner [RECREATIONAL]:** "I ran this race without support, pacers or crew, so I had to strategically place drop bags at aide stations: a pair of shoes, a jacket, long sleeve shirt, headlamp, and of course extra food." (https://mtnclmbr.cloud.prohosting.com/Bear100/Bear100.htm)

**Steve Bremner [RECREATIONAL]:** "I staggered into Temple Fork out of gas and overheated. There was no chair to sit in, so I found a shady spot and laid my sorry carcass down... I spent about ten minutes here before getting going again." (https://mtnclmbr.cloud.prohosting.com/Bear100/Bear100.htm)

**Steve Bremner [RECREATIONAL]:** "Dark night of the soul. Long climb. Stopping on the side of the trail; Runners passing; Are you okay? I'm just taking a break. Despair. Push on. And on. Trail markings sparse and infrequent... Those pink ribbons on the trail were absolutely helpful. Apparently some hunters had diabolically removed markers." (https://mtnclmbr.cloud.prohosting.com/Bear100/Bear100.htm)

**Steve Bremner [RECREATIONAL]:** "Long time down to Beaver Creek Campground. Creek crossing... Aide station helper tried to direct me on log over the creek. No way. I couldn't do that with my lack of balance from kidney failure. Finally I just wade across." (https://mtnclmbr.cloud.prohosting.com/Bear100/Bear100.htm)

**Anna Frost [UNKNOWN]:** "I awaited 'it' and awaited 'it.' I ran, I kept running, I ate and kept eating, I drank and kept drinking. But 'it' never arrived. 'It' being the 'indescribable pain' many had warned me of. It didn't come." (https://www.irunfar.com/waiting-for-it-anna-frost-and-the-2014-bear-100)

**Anna Frost [UNKNOWN]:** "My summer had been made up of that. Spending long, patient days in the big mountains of the Sawatch Range... I was ready to take on my own new challenge, The Bear 100." (https://www.irunfar.com/waiting-for-it-anna-frost-and-the-2014-bear-100)

**Anna Frost [UNKNOWN]:** "I immediately became impatient. I wanted to run the only long-distance pace I knew–50-mile pace–up the hill... in the end, I gave up and just ran my pace. It felt so much easier on my body. So far, I was moving, but not being patient." (https://www.irunfar.com/waiting-for-it-anna-frost-and-the-2014-bear-100)

**Anna Frost [UNKNOWN]:** "For me this was about a total change in mindset, 50 miles was just the warm up. It is amazing to think that just telling yourself that can make all the difference, but it did." (https://www.irunfar.com/waiting-for-it-anna-frost-and-the-2014-bear-100)

**Anna Frost [UNKNOWN]:** "I got through to 60 miles on Mule Bars, gels, Nuun electrolyte drink, and PocketFuel nut butter, but after that my stomach was not hungry. It was full. I knew I needed calories, but I also knew if I tried to put anything else in there, we would all be seeing it again immediately." (https://www.irunfar.com/waiting-for-it-anna-frost-and-the-2014-bear-100)

**Anna Frost [UNKNOWN]:** "I was greeted at 75 miles with soup mixed with rice. It went down a treat, but gurgled around as I went off into the night. The owls hooted, the elk were bugling, the coyotes giggling, the cows mooing with eyes glistening in the headtorch light." (https://www.irunfar.com/waiting-for-it-anna-frost-and-the-2014-bear-100)

**Anna Frost [UNKNOWN]:** "At midnight, the rain hit as promised. We made it down the muddy path before it turned into a mud slide that would cover other finishers from head to toe... I finished in 20:59." (https://www.irunfar.com/waiting-for-it-anna-frost-and-the-2014-bear-100)

**Ted [COMPETITIVE]:** "It was about as smooth as they get for me... Considering how many different ways one can come up short in these things, and that I ran the race without any crew or pacers, smooth is good. And to finish near the front with a sense of things being somewhat routine made it even better." (https://stuckintherockies.com/2012/10/the-bear-100/)

**Ted [COMPETITIVE]:** "On the mountainous course that climbs 22,000 vertical feet through the Wasatch/ Bear River Range of Northern Utah and Idaho, I finished in 22 hours and 22 minutes. That was good enough for 8th place. I was an hour and twenty minutes faster than last year." (https://stuckintherockies.com/2012/10/the-bear-100/)

**Ted [COMPETITIVE]:** "I started up front, but behind the leaders. As always, I made sure to 'run my own race' and was careful to not to get swept up into a pace I couldn't maintain all day. I followed behind the lead pack from the start to where the course heads uphill and narrows to a single track. I made my way up the first climb somewhere around 25th place, and ultimately reeled in nearly 20 people who went out in front but couldn't hang on." (https://stuckintherockies.com/2012/10/the-bear-100/)

**Ted [COMPETITIVE]:** "There were 13 aid stations on the course and my cumulative time at them was just 31 minutes... in an effort to streamline things I opted against a particular drop bag at Logan River, mile 68... when I got there, in a fog of mental fatigue after 15 hours on the course, I frantically searched for (with the help of several volunteers) my non-existent bag... not before eating up 5 minutes, which ended up being my longest aid stop of the race." (https://stuckintherockies.com/2012/10/the-bear-100/)

**Ted [COMPETITIVE]:** "If you're up for it, the back third of a 100 can take on more of a real 'race' feel with runners fighting to move up in the field or just hold their place. Last weekend, under the near-full moon, I often found myself turning off my headlamp so as not to alert someone ahead of me that I was gaining or give motivation to chase to someone behind." (https://stuckintherockies.com/2012/10/the-bear-100/)

**Miles4Hips Runner [UNKNOWN]:** "1 year, 11 months, and 2 days following my left hip surgeries and exactly 45 months following my right hip surgeries I set off on The Bear 100 course!... Just getting to the starting line un-injured felt like an incredible accomplishment!" (https://miles4hips.org/the-bear-100-race-report)

**Miles4Hips Runner [UNKNOWN]:** "I forgot my hiking poles at the house, so I decided I was just going to take it really easy for the first 20 miles until I could get them from my crew. I don't always run with hiking poles, but given the 100 mile distance, my plan had been to start using them on the climbs immediately." (https://miles4hips.org/the-bear-100-race-report)

**Miles4Hips Runner [UNKNOWN]:** "In all fairness, there was a TON of climbing involved in this course (22,518 feet to be exact, with around 70% of that occurring during the first 50 miles!), however the trails were less technical and less steep than many of the trails that I have trained on making me feel strong and confident. And the downhills were pleasantly runnable which allowed me to make up some time." (https://miles4hips.org/the-bear-100-race-report)

**Sarah Vlach [UNKNOWN]:** "Due to a fire, the course was rerouted two weeks out. Okay. Due to a severe weather forecast, the course was rerouted 24 hours out. Okay. Due to reroute, I was going to be without pacer through the night. In a snowstorm predicting 4-12 inches. Okay." (https://rmspineandsport.com/blog/posts/bear-100-2016/)

**Sarah Vlach [UNKNOWN]:** "Rain and mud, as predicted, right from the start... Runners went flying down the long downhill to Leatham Hollow, despite it being muddy, slippery and tight single track with difficult passing conditions. I stepped aside again and again to let people go by me. Felt my quads burn a little and worried about downhills later in the race." (https://rmspineandsport.com/blog/posts/bear-100-2016/)

**Sarah Vlach [UNKNOWN]:** "Rain turned to snow. Snow turned to a blinding blizzard. I did not see a single other runner all the way to Cowley (mile 75.73) and I was in that hyper-alert state of awareness, that I really had to hold it together to avoid hypothermia. My hand warmers in my ski gloves and my ability to keep running saved me." (https://rmspineandsport.com/blog/posts/bear-100-2016/)

**Sarah Vlach [UNKNOWN]:** "I ran directly into a cow. The cow was not interested in moving, and so I got ready to try to pass on tight single track, until I realized how ridiculous I was being, that in slippery, whiteout conditions I was going to try to pass a 1,000 lb animal. I talked myself into patience, and the kind cow eventually cleared the trail." (https://rmspineandsport.com/blog/posts/bear-100-2016/)

**Sarah Vlach [UNKNOWN]:** "Just over two days later, and I feel the best i have ever felt after a 100. One swollen ankle that is resolving, and legs that are just not that sore. This truly was my best 100 ever and I am grateful for every step." (https://rmspineandsport.com/blog/posts/bear-100-2016/)

**Luna Sandals Runner [UNKNOWN]:** "I sat slumped over in a camp chair by the fire. It was dark and cold in those mountains in the wee hours of the night. I was tired, delirious, and defeated. I was at mile 68 of the Bear 100. As we neared the aid station I told Sweeney, my pacer, that I was done, that I was dropping out at this aid station." (https://lunasandals.com/blogs/luna-sandals-blog/15680996-the-bear-100-a-100-mile-vision-quest-in-luna-sandals)

**Luna Sandals Runner [UNKNOWN]:** "I was seeing a pattern here. I leave an aid station feeling pretty good for 2-3 miles then suffer for 3-4 miles then get to another aid station and need a long pit stop to recharge." (https://lunasandals.com/blogs/luna-sandals-blog/15680996-the-bear-100-a-100-mile-vision-quest-in-luna-sandals)

**Luna Sandals Runner [UNKNOWN]:** "Somewhere on this stretch my bowels started to give me trouble. I had to venture out into the woods to take care of business every half hour. That was not fun. Especially after running out of wet wipes and having to use pine cones and rocks." (https://lunasandals.com/blogs/luna-sandals-blog/15680996-the-bear-100-a-100-mile-vision-quest-in-luna-sandals)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Hiking Poles:**
- **Miles4Hips Runner [UNKNOWN]:** Planned to use hiking poles from the start given the 100-mile distance, forgot them at home and had to wait until mile 20 to get them from crew. (https://miles4hips.org/the-bear-100-race-report)

**Footwear:**
- **Luna Sandals Runner [UNKNOWN]:** Tested an unreleased trail Luna model called "The Oso" (meaning 'the Bear' in Spanish) that they had been training in for the previous couple months. (https://lunasandals.com/blogs/luna-sandals-blog/15680996-the-bear-100-a-100-mile-vision-quest-in-luna-sandals)

**Drop Bags:**
- **Steve Bremner [RECREATIONAL]:** "I ran this race without support, pacers or crew, so I had to strategically place drop bags at aide stations: a pair of shoes, a jacket, long sleeve shirt, headlamp, and of course extra food." (https://mtnclmbr.cloud.prohosting.com/Bear100/Bear100.htm)
- **Ted [COMPETITIVE]:** Had drop bags at aid stations but made the mistake of skipping a drop bag at Logan River (mile 68), then wasted 5 minutes looking for the non-existent bag in mental fatigue. (https://stuckintherockies.com/2012/10/the-bear-100/)

**Cold Weather Gear:**
- **Sarah Vlach [UNKNOWN]:** Hand warmers in ski gloves and ability to keep running saved her during a blinding blizzard section where she didn't see another runner from mile ~60-75. Changed into full dry clothing at Tony Grove (mile 53.8) as weather evolved into a blizzard. (https://rmspineandsport.com/blog/posts/bear-100-2016/)
- **Steve Bremner [RECREATIONAL]:** "31 degrees. Frost. Slight wind. Tilting with kidney pain. Barely going. Long time down to Beaver Creek Campground... I take a break and dry out socks and shoes by the fire and wait for dawn." (https://mtnclmbr.cloud.prohosting.com/Bear100/Bear100.htm)

**Headlamps:**
- **Ted [COMPETITIVE]:** Under near-full moon conditions, turned off headlamp to avoid alerting other runners to his presence/pace, both while racing and at aid stations. (https://stuckintherockies.com/2012/10/the-bear-100/)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Course Profile:**
- **Miles4Hips Runner [UNKNOWN]:** "22,518 feet [of elevation gain] to be exact, with around 70% of that occurring during the first 50 miles!" (https://miles4hips.org/the-bear-100-race-report)
- **Miles4Hips Runner [UNKNOWN]:** "The trails were less technical and less steep than many of the trails that I have trained on making me feel strong and confident. And the downhills were pleasantly runnable which allowed me to make up some time." (https://miles4hips.org/the-bear-100-race-report)
- **Steve Bremner [RECREATIONAL]:** "21,000 feet of elevation gain in a dozen or so major climbs" with "nearly all either on single track trails or jeep roads" for 98+ miles (https://mtnclmbr.cloud.prohosting.com/Bear100/Bear100.htm)

**Specific Sections:**

*Start Area:*
- **Steve Bremner [RECREATIONAL]:** "It was dark at 6 A.M. when over 200 hopeful ultra-runners lined up at the start. We climbed on paved streets for a mile or more before entering the forest on a single track path." (https://mtnclmbr.cloud.prohosting.com/Bear100/Bear100.htm)
- **Anna Frost [UNKNOWN]:** "We started quietly, running through a residential area until hitting the canyon up." (https://www.irunfar.com/waiting-for-it-anna-frost-and-the-2014-bear-100)

*First Climb:*
- **Steve Bremner [RECREATIONAL]:** "The first few miles climbed steeply into the mountains west of Logan... we crested out about 8500' as the sun came up, after which we enjoyed a nice downhill." (https://mtnclmbr.cloud.prohosting.com/Bear100/Bear100.htm)
- **Miles4Hips Runner [UNKNOWN]:** "We hit single track climbing up the first big mountain... That's Logan, where we started, down in the valley" after ~4000 feet of climbing (https://miles4hips.org/the-bear-100-race-report)

*Early Miles:*
- **Steve Bremner [RECREATIONAL]:** "A few miles later at a 140 degree turn a trail marker had disappeared and several of us wandered off onto a false path that was not really a trail. It took about five minutes and after some others came behind we found the dislodged trail marker and got back on track." (https://mtnclmbr.cloud.prohosting.com/Bear100/Bear100.htm)
- **Steve Bremner [RECREATIONAL]:** Around mile 20-30: "From Leatham Hollow station we ran up a dirt road for just three miles before another small aide station (I didn't stop) and entered a single track trail that climbed steadily for a few miles and about 2,000 feet of elevation gain through a beautiful canyon with fantastic limestone outcroppings and a babbling brook replete with stunning waterfalls." (https://mtnclmbr.cloud.prohosting.com/Bear100/Bear100.htm)

*Wildlife Encounters:*
- **Anna Frost [UNKNOWN]:** "The owls hooted, the elk were bugling, the coyotes giggling, the cows mooing with eyes glistening in the headtorch light." (https://www.irunfar.com/waiting-for-it-anna-frost-and-the-2014-bear-100)
- **Sarah Vlach [UNKNOWN]:** "I ran directly into a cow. The cow was not interested in moving" on tight single track during snowstorm (https://rmspineandsport.com/blog/posts/bear-100-2016/)

*Creek Crossings:*
- **Steve Bremner [RECREATIONAL]:** "Creek crossing. Aide station helper tried to direct me on log over the creek. No way. I couldn't do that with my lack of balance from kidney failure. Finally I just wade across." (https://mtnclmbr.cloud.prohosting.com/Bear100/Bear100.htm)

*Final Descent:*

*Trail Markings:*
- **Steve Bremner [RECREATIONAL]:** "Trail markings sparse and infrequent. I remembered the pre-race briefing. Someone mentioned they would be leaving a couple hours ahead of the race and dropping extra pink ribbons on the trail. What a blessing! Those pink ribbons on the trail were absolutely helpful. Apparently some hunters had diabolically removed markers." (https://mtnclmbr.cloud.prohosting.com/Bear100/Bear100.htm)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Starting Strategy:**

*Conservative Start - [COMPETITIVE]:*
- **Ted [COMPETITIVE]:** "I started up front, but behind the leaders. As always, I made sure to 'run my own race' and was careful to not to get swept up into a pace I couldn't maintain all day. I followed behind the lead pack from the start to where the course heads uphill and narrows to a single track. I made my way up the first climb somewhere around 25th place, and ultimately reeled in nearly 20 people who went out in front but couldn't hang on. This has been my M.O. for the past several races." Finished in 22:22 for 8th place. (https://stuckintherockies.com/2012/10/the-bear-100/)

*Impatient Start - [UNKNOWN]:*
- **Anna Frost [UNKNOWN]:** "I immediately became impatient. I wanted to run the only long-distance pace I knew–50-mile pace–up the hill. I tried chatting to people, running behind people, I tried walking even the slightly steep uphills, but, in the end, I gave up and just ran my pace. It felt so much easier on my body. So far, I was moving, but not being patient." Finished in 20:59. (https://www.irunfar.com/waiting-for-it-anna-frost-and-the-2014-bear-100)

**Mental Approach:**

*50-Mile Warmup Mindset - [UNKNOWN]:*
- **Anna Frost [UNKNOWN]:** "For me this was about a total change in mindset, 50 miles was just the warm up. It is amazing to think that just telling yourself that can make all the difference, but it did. I came through 50 miles ready to go." (https://www.irunfar.com/waiting-for-it-anna-frost-and-the-2014-bear-100)

*Aid Station Focus - [UNKNOWN]:*
- **Anna Frost [UNKNOWN]:** "After that I just thought about keeping the same pace, about being patient until the next aid station. Ten miles, seven miles, eight miles, 10 miles. I never looked at the second half as the footsteps to 100 miles. It was just the next aid station's worth of footsteps." (https://www.irunfar.com/waiting-for-it-anna-frost-and-the-2014-bear-100)

**Aid Station Management:**

*Fast Transitions - [COMPETITIVE]:*
- **Ted [COMPETITIVE]:** "There were 13 aid stations on the course and my cumulative time at them was just 31 minutes" over 22:22 finish. Averaged ~2.4 minutes per aid station. (https://stuckintherockies.com/2012/10/the-bear-100/)

*Longer Stops for Recovery - [RECREATIONAL]:*
- **Steve Bremner [RECREATIONAL]:** Multiple 10+ minute aid station stops when overheated or struggling. At Temple Fork (mile 45): "I spent about ten minutes here before getting going again." (https://mtnclmbr.cloud.prohosting.com/Bear100/Bear100.htm)

**Night Strategy:**

*Without Pacers - [COMPETITIVE]:*
- **Ted [COMPETITIVE]:** "Taking on the night without any pacers to keep me motivated was a real concern. When you're out there alone in the dark with no one around, you can find yourself slowing to a walk when you should be running. I needed some other tactics to keep my pace up. So at the start of the night, I teamed up with the only other pacer-less runner around and we kept each other moving. Later, when a certain runner/pacer duo I was leap frogging with would come by I would fight to 'get on their wheel' and essentially have them pace me." (https://stuckintherockies.com/2012/10/the-bear-100/)

*Stealth Racing - [COMPETITIVE]:*
- **Ted [COMPETITIVE]:** "If you're up for it, the back third of a 100 can take on more of a real 'race' feel with runners fighting to move up in the field or just hold their place. Last weekend, under the near-full moon, I often found myself turning off my headlamp so as not to alert someone ahead of me that I was gaining or give motivation to chase to someone behind. I would enter and leave aid stations quietly and under darkness as well so that other runners wouldn't notice that I just came and went, leaving them to continue to waste time at the food table, around the fire, etc." (https://stuckintherockies.com/2012/10/the-bear-100/)

**Nutrition Strategy:**

*Successful Early Nutrition - [UNKNOWN]:*
- **Anna Frost [UNKNOWN]:** "I got through to 60 miles on Mule Bars, gels, Nuun electrolyte drink, and PocketFuel nut butter, but after that my stomach was not hungry. It was full. I knew I needed calories, but I also knew if I tried to put anything else in there, we would all be seeing it again immediately." At mile 75: "I was greeted at 75 miles with soup mixed with rice. It went down a treat." At mile 85: "As we approached mile 85, there was a bowl glowing bright yellow in the dim lights of the campfire. I saw nothing else but this bowl. This bowl of Doritos. Yellow with fake colouring and flavor. MSG galore. I wanted noting else in the world right then." (https://www.irunfar.com/waiting-for-it-anna-frost-and-the-2014-bear-100)

*Detailed Consumption - [COMPETITIVE]:*
- **Ted [COMPETITIVE] consumed through 22:22 finish:** "25 gels, mostly Honey Stinger / 2 Stinger chews / 8 Nuun tablets / 16 S-Caps / 6 – 40 oz. bladders with Skratch Labs drink mix / 10 cups of Coke / 6 cups of chicken broth / 1 PB&J / 7 advil" (https://stuckintherockies.com/2012/10/the-bear-100/)

*Stomach Failure - [RECREATIONAL]:*
- **Steve Bremner [RECREATIONAL]:** "My stomach started a rebellion and I vomited up much of what I'd been eating for the last two hours as well as volumes of water. I didn't replace the lost water fast enough and a few miles later my right kidney began to fail." Only able to keep down chicken broth for most of the second half. (https://mtnclmbr.cloud.prohosting.com/Bear100/Bear100.htm)

**Pacing Patterns:**

*[UNKNOWN] Pattern:*
- **Luna Sandals Runner [UNKNOWN]:** "I was seeing a pattern here. I leave an aid station feeling pretty good for 2-3 miles then suffer for 3-4 miles then get to another aid station and need a long pit stop to recharge." (https://lunasandals.com/blogs/luna-sandals-blog/15680996-the-bear-100-a-100-mile-vision-quest-in-luna-sandals)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Medical Issues:**

*Kidney Failure - [RECREATIONAL]:*
- **Steve Bremner [RECREATIONAL]:** "My stomach started a rebellion and I vomited up much of what I'd been eating for the last two hours as well as volumes of water. I didn't replace the lost water fast enough and a few miles later my right kidney began to fail... the final death march in excruciating pain for 30 miles with a failed kidney." Had to take 2 naps of about an hour each at the finish before kidney recovered. (https://mtnclmbr.cloud.prohosting.com/Bear100/Bear100.htm)

*Heat-Related Issues - [RECREATIONAL]:*
- **Steve Bremner [RECREATIONAL]:** "I was starting to get 'cooked' as the heat of the day grew more oppressive... I staggered into Temple Fork out of gas and overheated. There was no chair to sit in, so I found a shady spot and laid my sorry carcass down, doing my best to ignore concerned aide station workers." (https://mtnclmbr.cloud.prohosting.com/Bear100/Bear100.htm)

*Stomach Problems - [UNKNOWN]:*
- **Anna Frost [UNKNOWN]:** After mile 60: "my stomach was not hungry. It was full. I knew I needed calories, but I also knew if I tried to put anything else in there, we would all be seeing it again immediately." (https://www.irunfar.com/waiting-for-it-anna-frost-and-the-2014-bear-100)
- **Luna Sandals Runner [UNKNOWN]:** "Around mile 28 I started to not feel very good. I was getting a little nauseous and having a hard time eating. At the 30 mile aid station I ate a little and used the bathroom. But still felt sick. By the time I got to the aid station at mile 36 I was feeling really sick and out of it. The crew said I was acting drunk." (https://lunasandals.com/blogs/luna-sandals-blog/15680996-the-bear-100-a-100-mile-vision-quest-in-luna-sandals)

**Mental Breaking Points:**

*Mile 68 Crisis - [UNKNOWN]:*
- **Luna Sandals Runner [UNKNOWN]:** "I sat slumped over in a camp chair by the fire. It was dark and cold in those mountains in the wee hours of the night. I was tired, delirious, and defeated. I was at mile 68 of the Bear 100. As we neared the aid station I told Sweeney, my pacer, that I was done, that I was dropping out at this aid station. When I told him tears welled up in my eyes at the verbal admission of defeat." (https://lunasandals.com/blogs/luna-sandals-blog/15680996-the-bear-100-a-100-mile-vision-quest-in-luna-sandals)

*Night Section Struggles - [RECREATIONAL]:*
- **Steve Bremner [RECREATIONAL]:** "Dark night of the soul. Long climb. Stopping on the side of the trail; Runners passing; Are you okay? I'm just taking a break. Despair. Push on. And on." (https://mtnclmbr.cloud.prohosting.com/Bear100/Bear100.htm)

**Environmental Hazards:**

*Hypothermia Risk - [UNKNOWN]:*
- **Sarah Vlach [UNKNOWN]:** During blizzard section alone at night: "I was in that hyper-alert state of awareness, that I really had to hold it together to avoid hypothermia. My hand warmers in my ski gloves and my ability to keep running saved me. I came in to Cowley aid station, and vowed to get out of there as quickly as possible. There were many cold runners huddled around a fire... Despite this rapid turnaround, I was COLD leaving there. It was dumping snow, my feet were soaking wet, and I began jogging uphill immediately as I knew I had to warm up. Other runners were much colder, and you could see how difficult it was for
