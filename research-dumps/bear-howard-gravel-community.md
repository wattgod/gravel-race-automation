# BEAR HOWARD GRAVEL — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Event Overview & History

**Bear Howard Gravel** is held annually in early August in Flagstaff, Arizona. The event is organized by Sable Events and honors Arizona legend Jessie "Bear" Howard, a 6'4" frontiersman who "could whip just about anyone" even in his twilight years before his death in 1910.

The race started and finished at Flagstaff High School in early years (2022), but moved to Lowell Observatory for the finish by 2023. In 2025, it's in its **5th year** with registration opening February 1st.

**Three distance options:**
- **100 miles**: ~6,000+ ft elevation gain, described as "the crown jewel" and "no joke"
- **60 miles** (metric century): ~2,800 ft elevation gain
- **30 miles**: Fast and beginner-friendly

The organizer's description [UNKNOWN]: "The 100 mile course is NO JOKE. It is both challenging in its features, it will test your bike handling as well as your fitness. It is not the distance of UNBOUND, we continue to get feedback that this is epic and certainly no walk in the park." (https://www.sableevents.com/events/bearhowardgravel)

## Course Details & Terrain

The 100-mile course is described as "primarily gravel roads around N. Arizona" with "a cool section of single track" and views of Kendrick Peak, Sitgreaves, and the San Francisco Peaks.

**Key 2022-2023 course change:** Added "a challenging out and back climb up Saddle Mountain, north of the Peaks" which increased distance to make it an even century. The organizer notes: "There is one section on a state highway on 180 that will be posted and have a volunteer to direct traffic."

**2024 course direction change:** After reversing the direction for 2024 and "getting nothing but positive feedback based on the racing dynamic," the organizer committed to keeping it that way.

The 60-mile stays "west of the peaks but almost always having them in view."

**Aid stations (2025):**
- 100 mile: 3 aid stations
- 60 mile: 2 aid stations  
- 30 mile: 1 aid station

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**From event organizer [UNKNOWN]:** 

"**Gravel bike or 29'er mtb. Ride what you are comfortable with!** If you are on a gravel bike I would suggest **nothing less than 700-40c**" (https://www.sableevents.com/events/bearhowardgravel)

**Bike choice context:** The course includes "a few sections of technical gravel" and "a cool section of single track" - wider tires and possibly MTB capability recommended for the 100-mile.

No rider-specific tire or equipment reports found in sources.

## Weather & Conditions

**From event organizer [UNKNOWN]:**

"Flagstaff is pretty nice in August. But at 7,000 ft **sun screen will be key**. While on course you may experience our **infamous monsoons**, so maybe a light rain jacket but often temperatures are pleasant and rain may feel good." (https://www.sableevents.com/events/bearhowardgravel)

The event is held in early August (August 2-3 in recent years). Flagstaff sits at 7,000+ ft elevation.

## Race Character & Rules

**From organizer [UNKNOWN]:**

"DON'T BE A JERK. You know what that means. Don't cheat, cut the course, punch the guy next to you in the finish line chute, yelling at volunteers etc. This is supposed to fun remember!"

"**Obey all the traffic laws, the road is open to traffic**... If you do encounter a car on the gravel roads, PLEASE get over to let them by... please, please for the future of the event obey all traffic laws."

**No refunds:** "We will not be offering refunds or comp'd entries for the next year of any kind."

The organizer describes the spirit: "In the spirit of adventure and exploration, like Bear Howard himself, we came up with this event to leave you feeling legendary (if only in your own mind). Sure the stories that follow around the campfire will be exaggerated and inflated, fueled by whiskey and grandeur, but we promise you adventure and a good time."

**Nearby attractions:** Grand Canyon is 1.5 hours away. Flagstaff has excellent trails for hiking/running.
