# BEAVER DAM GRAVEL GRINDER — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Event Overview & Unique Character

The Beaver Dam Gravel Grinder is described by organizer Dawn Andone as explicitly designed "to get people into the beautiful backcountry—a side of Nevada that most people do not experience." The event emphasizes showcasing Lincoln County's remote terrain over Las Vegas's downtown scene.

**Dawn Andone (Organizer) [UNKNOWN]:** "This is not a race, it is a casual ride; you can compete against yourself or your mates if you like. The prize is not only the wonderful scenic vistas you will enjoy, but when you reach the end there will be food." (https://www.cyclingwest.com/gravel-biking/beaver-dam-gravel-grinder-comes-south-east-nevada-june/)

**Dawn Andone (Organizer) [UNKNOWN]:** "We want you to enjoy the scenery and take-in what Lincoln County and Beaver Dam State Park have to offer. Riders usually complete the course in six hours." (https://www.cyclingwest.com/gravel-biking/beaver-dam-gravel-grinder-comes-south-east-nevada-june/)

The event has a history dating back at least to 2015, with the 2022 edition being the "ninth annual" event with 33 participants. (https://lccentral.com/2022/06/24/mountain-bikers-take-on-beaver-dam-gravel-grinder/)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Event Organizer Statement [UNKNOWN]:** "This ride is not skinny-tire road bike friendly. If you have a fat-tire bike, mountain bike, cyclocross bike, or adventure/all purpose bike you will be able to do this ride." (https://beaverdamgravelgrinder.com/about-the-gravel-grinder/)

**Dawn Andone (Organizer) [UNKNOWN]:** "Fat tire, gravel or mountain bikes all work well. Some areas can be rocky and others sandy." (https://www.cyclingwest.com/gravel-biking/beaver-dam-gravel-grinder-comes-south-east-nevada-june/)

The event emphasizes self-sufficiency: "You need to be technically savvy and bring any gear you might need to replace or fix tires, chains, or any other possible pitfalls." (https://lincolncountynevada.com/events/spring-events/beaver-dam-gravel-grinder/)

## Weather Experienced

**2022 Event:** Participants "battled the wind" during the ride on June 18. (https://lccentral.com/2022/06/24/mountain-bikers-take-on-beaver-dam-gravel-grinder/)

**2021 Event:** "Last year [2021], temperatures during the Gravel Grinder reached 106 F" (https://lccentral.com/2022/06/24/mountain-bikers-take-on-beaver-dam-gravel-grinder/)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Dawn Andone (Organizer) [UNKNOWN]:** "The course is mostly over dirt and gravel backcountry and jeep roads. There are some rocky patches that can be considered technical, but we have tried to keep those to a minimum. However, rain events can change the terrain—sometimes this results in having to change the route." (https://www.cyclingwest.com/gravel-biking/beaver-dam-gravel-grinder-comes-south-east-nevada-june/)

According to USA Cycling certified Level 1 coach Mark Orton's description referenced by organizers: "gravel grinders are gravel road races and rides that combine riding on surfaces such as asphalt, gravel, dirt, some single-track trails and maintenance or B roads. The courses vary from hard-packed dirt to softball-sized rocks." Organizers confirm: "This describes the course to a T!" (https://beaverdamgravelgrinder.com/about-the-gravel-grinder/)

**Dawn Andone (Organizer) [UNKNOWN]:** "The road taking you out of the park winds up a dirt/gravel road, through pines and junipers. The wildflowers will be in bloom so whites, reds, yellows, purples, and oranges will dot the landscape and standout against the evergreens. You ride along the rim of the park so you can see all the geologic formations created during periods of volcanic activity millions of years ago. The route takes you past old dams, and through ranching communities, with a lunch stop at the old one-room schoolhouse in Barclay." (https://www.cyclingwest.com/gravel-biking/beaver-dam-gravel-grinder-comes-south-east-nevada-june/)

The park is at approximately 5,000 feet elevation, featuring "Pinyon pines and junipers dominate the woodlands, with Ponderosa pines near the park's springs." (https://www.cyclingwest.com/gravel-biking/beaver-dam-gravel-grinder-comes-south-east-nevada-june/)

Participants can choose between 35-mile and 45-mile routes, with a 10-mile cutoff option for novice riders. (https://www.cyclingwest.com/gravel-biking/beaver-dam-gravel-grinder-comes-south-east-nevada-june/)

## Logistics & Accommodations

**Dawn Andone (Organizer) [UNKNOWN]:** "Stay at the Park! Come camp in one of two campgrounds at the park. The ride starts at 7:30 am and the closest town is 35 miles down a gravel road. Camping is your best option. Stay Friday and Saturday night. If you prefer to stay in a motel, Caliente has the closest accommodations." (https://www.cyclingwest.com/gravel-biking/beaver-dam-gravel-grinder-comes-south-est-nevada-june/)

Alternative lodging exists in the towns of Caliente, Panaca, Pioche, and Alamo. "We recommend looking into reservations as soon as possible because the summer months tend to book up fast." (https://lincolncountynevada.com/gravel-grinder-challenge-lincoln-countys-ultimate-ride/)

Other nearby camping options include Kershaw-Ryan and Cathedral Gorge State Parks. (https://lincolncountynevada.com/gravel-grinder-challenge-lincoln-countys-ultimate-ride/)
