# BELGIAN WAFFLE RIDE KANSAS — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Rebecca Fahringer [ELITE]:** "BWR Kansas was my first BWR event, and man did it deliver! This is coming from the girl who didn't even get a waffle. I had NO idea what to expect and relied on the intel of my teammates to tell me what the course would be like and the fact that NO, I did not actually need a hydration pack and 3 bottles. I would also like to note that no one told me how long this event was until literally the week before." (https://www.belgianwaffleride.bike/blogs/news/2022-bwr-kansas-results)

**Rebecca Fahringer [ELITE]:** "After an unexpected call-up and start-line-sealant-top-up, the race was off! Lucky for me, it was a moderate paced neutral roll through town, and it was hard to tell when neutral ended and racing began... I came out as the lead woman [from first singletrack], but was one huge effort short of connecting with the small group ahead of me, and they hit the road and were GONE." (https://www.belgianwaffleride.bike/blogs/news/2022-bwr-kansas-results)

**Rebecca Fahringer [ELITE]:** "Going into the Snake Farm technical section, the group essentially let me in first, knowing I would be passing no matter what. From the moment we hit the grass I had a gap, and I wouldn't doubt if the gap was about 2-minutes or more by the time I was out of that section. With 15-miles left in the race, I had to decide if I thought I could go solo or should sit up and maybe let it come down to a sprint with Whitney. I thought to myself 'I can do anything for 15-miles', especially knowing there was a 6-mile section of single track at the end." (https://www.belgianwaffleride.bike/blogs/news/2022-bwr-kansas-results)

**Rebecca Fahringer [ELITE]:** "Super happy with the win, not just because I won a bike race, duh, but also because this past month was the first time 'ze sensations' have been there since I had my concussion in September 2021." (https://www.belgianwaffleride.bike/blogs/news/2022-bwr-kansas-results)

**Nicholas Roche [ELITE]:** "I absolutely loved it. I can't compare with the other US ones, as I have not done one, but your event stood up to all my expectations of wanting to come over! Good pre-race atmosphere with concerts, Unroad Expo, etc. Great idea to have it in the center of a town. Great to have the bike shop there for last minute purchase. (Nothing like that in Europe.) Saturday recon ride was a great idea. The course was lots of fun. Obviously, as it was a first for me, and never been on a proper single-track, I'll say was too technical for me. That's because I'm a rookie! Hahhaha." (https://www.belgianwaffleride.bike/blogs/news/2022-bwr-kansas-results)

**Nicholas Roche [ELITE]:** "Coming from the road, I really appreciate the motorcycle escort, and car behind front group. Makes a huge difference! But, also having standing feed zone with staff/helpers giving out bottles was cool! I was like a kid rediscovering cycling!" (https://www.belgianwaffleride.bike/blogs/news/2022-bwr-kansas-results)

**Jonas Orset [ELITE]:** "It's a chilly morning in Lawrence, Kansas. It didn't take many minutes to warm up. The race is already aggressive, and we have just started. It's going to be a long day in the Kansas hills. And a windy one: it's a steady 16 mph (7 m/s) wind from the north, and right now, we are facing it." (https://nordictrailblazer.cc/races/belgian-waffle-ride-kansas-23/)

**Jonas Orset [ELITE]:** "We have done 82k/51 miles of the race and head into some narrow trails into the woods. – May I pass, please? I ask. I am in the Perry Lake Trail, a 7k technical section. I lost the wheel of the first riders of the group right before the trail and try now to make up ground, passing one rider and chasing the next. I struggle to find a good flow, and soon, I am all by myself in the woods. There are some sections where I need to dismount and carry the bike." (https://nordictrailblazer.cc/races/belgian-waffle-ride-kansas-23/)

**Jonas Orset [ELITE]:** "A stick of wood is jammed between the fork and the wheel. I pull it out and start riding, but the rider in front is gone. I am alone with 110k/68 miles to go." (https://nordictrailblazer.cc/races/belgian-waffle-ride-kansas-23/)

**Jonas Orset [ELITE]:** "– I must hang on; I'm not fighting this wind alone! I think to myself. My motivation right now is not to get a result but to get to the finish. I'm riding with three other riders. We are keeping a good pace. In the hardest climbs, I don't want to keep suffering, but I know the road home gets so much longer if you find yourself alone out here on the prairie." (https://nordictrailblazer.cc/races/belgian-waffle-ride-kansas-23/)

**Jonas Orset [ELITE]:** "The last final of the course is pretty unique for gravel. When we arrive at the finishing arena, we are led onto a 10-mile (16 km) single track instead of passing the finish line. It's a flowy and smooth trail, but it's hard to pass other riders... – Where is the finish? I get a little frustrated. The trail is never-ending. It's 2 km to go. It takes forever." (https://nordictrailblazer.cc/races/belgian-waffle-ride-kansas-23/)

**Torbjørn Andre Røed [ELITE]:** "Røed said he knew he wanted to be first into the final singletrack and was able to create separation from Johnston, who battled the final 40k alone. The Aussie was only 30 seconds off the Norwegian at the finish."

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**The Snake Farm - Slengenwinkel Doolhof [Course Feature]:** "The Snake Farm has got to be the most glorious sector in any gravel or unroad race on the planet. It's roughly 8-km of cyclocross inspired twists & turns, grass & berms, snakes & curves, and hills & bergs, which make for the most dynamic and fun racing that could ever be imagined. The Snake Farm is Matt Gilhousen's property and he has spent an enormous amount of time and energy over the last year grooming this special place." (https://www.belgianwaffleride.bike/blogs/news/2022-bwr-kansas-results)

**Perry Lake Trail [Course Feature]:** "5-mile single-track of Perry Lake (Perryberg Forest). While everyone went in together, they came out in ones and twos. In fact, Griffin Easter and Kerry Werner exited this diabolical diversion a minute ahead of third place." Jonas Orset describes it as "7k technical section" with "some sections where I need to dismount and carry the bike. In other parts, the biggest challenge is to avoid the sharp rocks." (https://www.belgianwaffleride.bike/blogs/news/2022-bwr-kansas-results and https://nordictrailblazer.cc/races/belgian-waffle-ride-kansas-23/)

**Final Singletrack Section:** "When we arrive at the finishing arena, we are led onto a 10-mile (16 km) single track instead of passing the finish line. It's a flowy and smooth trail, but it's hard to pass other riders." (https://nordictrailblazer.cc/races/belgian-waffle-ride-kansas-23/)

**Overall Course Character:** "Like all BWR courses, it featured a slapdash blend of pavement, singletrack, and gravel road." The 2023 Waffle course was "123 miles with 6,823 feet of climbing." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/belgian-waffle-ride-kansas-wraps-tripel-crown-of-gravel-series-registration-opens)

**Lawrence River Trail:** "Athletes finished on the famous Lawrence River Trail system which was in the best condition they had been all year! An absolute treat for those who traveled to see some of the finest riding gems that Lawrence offers." (https://www.stevetilfordfoundationracing.com/team-updates/belgian-waffle-ride-kansas)

**Course Layout:** The 2025 Montana course (for reference) shows typical BWR structure: Waffle – 115 miles | 8,240 ft climbing | 16 Unroad Sectors | 60% Unroad; Wafer – 69 miles | 4,212 ft climbing | 7 Unroad Sectors | 35% Unroad; Wanna – 30 miles (https://www.belgianwaffleride.bike/pages/kansas)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Rebecca Fahringer [ELITE] - Technical Advantage:** "After the second single track section (Perry Lake) I came out with a fair lead, but knew it was silly to try to hold it, solo, on a windy road, so took a moment to use the facilitrees, and waited for everyone to come out on the other side. But this was proof that I had a definitive advantage in the technical sections." (https://www.belgianwaffleride.bike/blogs/news/2022-bwr-kansas-results)

**Rebecca Fahringer [ELITE] - Final 15 Miles Decision:** "With 15-miles left in the race, I had to decide if I thought I could go solo or should sit up and maybe let it come down to a sprint with Whitney. I thought to myself 'I can do anything for 15-miles', especially knowing there was a 6-mile section of single track at the end." (https://www.belgianwaffleride.bike/blogs/news/2022-bwr-kansas-results)

**Jonas Orset [ELITE] - Positioning for Final Singletrack:** "I set the pace into the last corner. Kyle Trudeau sprints past me and makes the corner first. I enter the trail second of us. Now, it's all about finding the rhythm on these trails." This shows the importance of entering technical sections in good position. (https://nordictrailblazer.cc/races/belgian-waffle-ride-kansas-23/)

**Jonas Orset [ELITE] - Conservative Group Riding:** "I'm riding conservative and try not to do more than I need to. My legs feel alright, but my breath is still not 100% after my recent cold. My lung capacity is not at its highest, but I am determined to get the most out of my day either way." (https://nordictrailblazer.cc/races/belgian-waffle-ride-kansas-23/)

**Elite Race Dynamics [2022]:** "This was by far the most dynamic and exciting BWR race in 12 years of Unroadiness. There were so many different breaks that got away where we thought that was the winning move, only to have the group reform before another attack would get off the front. It was relentless and the course's undulating nature offered repeated ramps for escape." (https://www.belgianwaffleride.bike/blogs/news/2022-bwr-kansas-results)

**Torbjørn Andre Røed [ELITE] - 2023 Winning Strategy:** "Røed said he knew he wanted to be first into the final singletrack and was able to create separation" - emphasizes the importance of technical section positioning at elite level.

## DNF Risk Factors

**Mechanicals in Technical Sections:** Jonas Orset [ELITE]: "A stick of wood is jammed between the fork and the wheel" during Perry Lake Trail section at mile 51, showing debris hazards in singletrack. (https://nordictrailblazer.cc/races/belgian-waffle-ride-kansas-23/)

**Sidewall Cuts:** "Stefano Barbieri went off the front with Jonas Orset and gained a two-minute advantage, which Nicholas Roche clawed back to make the break three-strong... but only for a moment as Stefano suffered a sidewall gash and was sadly out of the running, in spite of his good legs." (https://www.belgianwaffleride.bike/blogs/news/2022-bwr-kansas-results)

**Flats:** "Eventually Meaghan flatted and had to DNF" from the lead women's group. (https://www.belgianwaffleride.bike/blogs/news/2022-bwr-kansas-results)

**Wind/Solo Riding:** Rebecca Fahringer [ELITE] noted she "knew it was silly to try to hold it, solo, on a windy road" after technical sections, highlighting the challenge of sustained solo efforts in Kansas wind. (https://www.belgianwaffleride.bike/blogs/news/2022-bwr-kansas-results)

**Railroad Crossing Delays [2023]:** "In the women's race, a big pile-up caused separation between the women leaders. Later in the race, others were stopped at a railroad crossing for nearly five minutes." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/belgian-waffle-ride-kansas-wraps-tripel-crown-of-gravel-series-registration-opens)

## Weather Experienced

**2021 Race:** "The high temperature of the day was 55 degrees Fahrenheit, with winds out the North - which meant a returning tailwind! Lawrence had nonstop rainfall on both Wednesday and Thursday that proved to settle the dust, and yield very fast rolling gravel roads and 'hero dirt' on the River Trail. The leaves here had begun to boast their autumn colors." (https://www.stevetilfordfoundationracing.com/team-updates/belgian-waffle-ride-kansas)

**2023 Race:** Jonas Orset [ELITE]: "It's a chilly morning in Lawrence, Kansas. It didn't take many minutes to warm up... it's a steady 16 mph (7 m/s) wind from the north, and right now, we are facing it." The article also notes: "Winds were intense throughout the day."

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Pre-Race Festival:** "The weekend launched with a special Steve Tilford Foundation fundraising party on Friday night. The night boasted a private concert for the Foundation on the 2nd floor of Sunflower Outdoor and Bike Shop by none other than, Michael Franti. Michael's positive message and bright soul truly sparked off the weekend with the best of vibes. We danced, had a silent auction for donations, ate tacos, and celebrated the life of Steve." (https://www.stevetilfordfoundationracing.com/team-updates/belgian-waffle-ride-kansas)

**Nicholas Roche [ELITE] - Event Atmosphere:** "Good pre-race atmosphere with concerts, Unroad Expo, etc. Great idea to have it in the center of a town. Great to have the bike shop there for last minute purchase. (Nothing like that in Europe.) Saturday recon ride was a great idea." (https://www.belgianwaffleride.bike/blogs/news/2022-bwr-kansas-results)

**World-Class Participation:** "We even had some very well known names to the sport of cycling travel from over seas to participate in the first year event! UCI World Team Deceunick-Quick-Step brought a few of their athletes including Belgian cyclist, Remco Evenepoel! Tiffany Cromwell of the Women's world tour team, WmnCycling Canyon Sram, came to race the waffle and ended up clenching the victory!" (https://www.stevetilfordfoundationracing.com/team-updates/belgian-waffle-ride-kansas)

**Expo & Local Support:** "Saturday boasted a weekend expo, and participants traveled to Lawrence from all over the world. Bikes were prepped and tuned at our local shop - Sunflower Outdoor and Bike Shop - and everyone who came in town was able to get an up close and personal glimpse of the new Specialized Gravel Experience center at the bike shop!" (https://www.stevetilfordfoundationracing.com/team-updates/belgian-waffle-ride-kansas)

**Snake Farm Hecklers:** "We had hecklers by the cyclocross barriers in true cyclocross fashion. (It is cyclocross season after all, and we didn't want anyone to forget it!)" (https://www.stevetilfordfoundationracing.com/team-updates/belgian-waffle-ride-kansas)

**Post-Race:** Jonas Orset [ELITE]: "The best thing about this race would, nevertheless, be the waffles at the finish, and I'm not getting one, but two waffles and a Belgian finisher beer." (https://nordictrailblazer.cc/races/belgian-waffle-ride-kansas-23/)

**Registration Volume:** "There were roughly 670 registered riders" in 2022. "Short of 400 riders were lining up for the Belgian Waffle Ride" in 2023. (https://www.belgianwaffleride.bike/blogs/news/2022-bwr-kansas-results and https://nordictrailblazer.cc/races/belgian-waffle-ride-kansas-23/)

**Music:** "G. Love & Special Sauce, THE GET UP KIDS" performed at the 2022 event. (https://www.belgianwaffleride.bike/blogs/news/2022-bwr-kansas-results)
