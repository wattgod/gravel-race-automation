# BEND DIRT FEST — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Event Origin & Background

The inaugural Bend Dirt Fest replaced the Oregon 24 mountain biking event after the U.S. Forest Service informed race organizer Mike Ripley (Mudslinger Events) in April 2025 that the Oregon 24 could no longer be held due to dispersed camping restrictions at Wanoga Sno-park. With only a few months of planning, Ripley pivoted to create a multi-sport event for the same July 12, 2025 date.

**Mike Ripley (Race Organizer):** "After the land was reclaimed for our dirt camping, we really didn't fit the venue anymore. I get it. The Forest Service doesn't have any more staff to monitor people in areas that really aren't designated." (https://www.bendbulletin.com/2025/07/10/inaugural-bend-dirt-fest-includes-a-half-marathon-mountain-biking-gravel-riding/)

## Race Format & Distances

The event offers three disciplines, all starting from the Athletic Club of Bend:
- **Trail Run:** 13.1 miles (half marathon)
- **Gravel Cycling:** 54 miles or 35 miles  
- **Mountain Biking:** 39 miles (36 miles timed + 3-5 mile return to venue)

**Optional Team Format:** Three-person teams (one athlete per discipline on the longest courses) with combined times determining placement.

Start times: MTB/Gravel at 8:00 AM, Trail Run at 8:45 AM

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Grace Perkins [COMPETITIVE] (Top women's finisher, trail run, 1:35:13.9):** "I think it will definitely grow a lot. I'm surprised (Bend) doesn't have more events like this because everyone does so many different activities. It is fun to have a multisport event where you can have a team and get all the activities going." (https://www.bendbulletin.com/2025/07/12/bend-dirt-fest-super-successful-in-its-first-year/)

**Matthew Bird [ELITE] (Gravel winner, 2:35:08.4, from Adelaide, Australia):** "I had a bit of a travel dilemma and ended up taking five days off the bike, so I needed a leg-stretcher before next weekend. It was a really good course, with a nice vibe around the event and it was good, hard racing for three hours." (https://www.bendbulletin.com/2025/07/12/bend-dirt-fest-super-successful-in-its-first-year/)

**Mike Ripley (Race Organizer):** "The foundation has been laid for a monster event in 2026. The goal was to create an event that embraced the adventure of Bend, Oregon. Where someone could roll out of bed, go run a half, head over to the Athletic Club, grab their bike — gravel or mountain — and have a great day." (https://www.bendbulletin.com/2025/07/12/bend-dirt-fest-super-successful-in-its-first-year/)

**Mike Ripley:** "It was super successful. I couldn't be more stoked with it. Then next week we have the High Cascades 100, our biggest event." (https://www.bendbulletin.com/2025/07/12/bend-dirt-fest-super-successful-in-its-first-year/)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Gravel Course:** Nearly 4,000 feet of elevation gain over the first 30 miles, then mostly downhill over the final 24 miles. (https://www.bendbulletin.com/2025/07/12/bend-dirt-fest-super-successful-in-its-first-year/)

**Mountain Bike Course:** More than 3,000 feet of climbing in the first 22 miles, followed by downhill riding over the final 14 miles. Utilizes singletrack trails in Deschutes National Forest west of Bend, with gravel and MTB courses sharing the Wanoga area. (https://www.bendbulletin.com/2025/07/12/bend-dirt-fest-super-successful-in-its-first-year/)

**Trail Run:** 13.1 miles with 60% on dirt. Course includes both a "paved flat portion and a challenging section of technical trail." Portions of singletrack are in filtered shade, but course receives full sun overall. Surface described as "red hero cinder dirt or fine moon dust" depending on conditions. (https://www.mudslingerevents.com/bend-dirt-fest)

**Mike Ripley's [UNKNOWN] Course Description:** "It's dusty and loose. Gravel in Central Oregon is not your typical gravel, it's dirt combined with cinder. It's definitely spicy." (https://www.bendbulletin.com/2025/07/10/inaugural-bend-dirt-fest-includes-a-half-marathon-mountain-biking-gravel-riding/)

All courses start at Athletic Club of Bend and use singletrack trails and dirt roads to the west, with half-marathon course separate from cycling courses. (https://www.bendbulletin.com/2025/07/12/bend-dirt-fest-super-successful-in-its-first-year/)

Post-race festivities include finisher and age-group awards, live music, and cold brews from 10 Barrel Brewing. Event described as ending "with a party worthy of Bend's outdoor spirit." (https://www.mudslingerevents.com/bend-dirt-fest)

The event replaced the beloved Oregon 24, which had developed a strong family-oriented culture over 15 years. **Mike Ripley:** "People would basically plan their year around coming up with their RV and posting up with their kids. We would have about 90 kids do the event. It was very family-oriented, and people would make the voyage every year from as far as California, Idaho. All night laps, and just a lot of social connectivity." (https://www.bendbulletin.com/2025/07/10/inaugural-bend-dirt-fest-includes-a-half-marathon-mountain-biking-gravel-riding/)

Despite only a few months of planning and launching mid-cycle, the event was characterized as "super successful" by the organizer and viewed as having "room to grow" with potential to become "a monster event in 2026."
