# BERRYMAN EPIC — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Carey Lowery [RECREATIONAL/ELITE - competed in both categories across years]:** "I woke up to cloudy skies and a temperature of 60 degrees ... yes! I managed to line up within the first few rows (250 racers in all) and patiently waited for someone to yell, 'Go!' Instead, I was momentarily stunned by a blast from a cannon, which I swear to God was right next to me, although I never saw it. I will remember that next year." (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2010/10/berryman-epic-race-report.html)

**Carey Lowery [RECREATIONAL]:** "After about 10 minutes, I realized that although I was not as powerful as her, I had the upper hand in the technical stuff. I made a pass when she bobbled on a sketchy climb, dug deep to open a gap, and settled into a 5 hour race pace after about 15 minutes." (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2010/10/berryman-epic-race-report.html)

**Carey Lowery [RECREATIONAL]:** "The race takes place on the Ozark and Berryman Trails. These alternate between ridge tops and creek bottoms. The topography is gently rolling; the longest climb was probably 0.2 miles and at a relatively easy grade. This, combined with dry conditions, made for a superfast course. I spent a lot of time in the big ring." (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2010/10/berryman-epic-race-report.html)

**Carey Lowery [ELITE]:** "Even though I was in the Ozarks, these mountains are old and eroded so the climbs are neither steep nor long. But today it felt like every climb was like Pinhoti #3." (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2011/10/berryman-epic-race-report.html)

**MashOr/Mitch [ELITE]:** "Epic would be how most would describe the 24 mile loop that is the Berryman Trail... This loop is actually named by IMBA as an 'Epic' on their blog. Now throw in an additional and spectacular 15 miles of the 45 mile Courtois section of the Ozark Trail along with 16 miles of rolling gravel roads, and you truly have an epic day." (https://gorctrails.com/berryman-trail-epic/)

**Mark Gullett [ELITE]:** "The descent to the Brazil Creek crossing was a sloppy muddy mess but there was a temporary bridge built across the water which was nice. My legs were covered in mud by that point but anything that kept my toes from freezing water was appreciated." (http://www.markgullett.com/2009/10/berryman-epic-recap.html)

**Mark Gullett [ELITE]:** "None of the hills were all that steep but many of them were several minute climbs and when you combine that with the slick conditions it starts to wear on you." (http://www.markgullett.com/2009/10/berryman-epic-recap.html)

**Steve Tilford [COMPETITIVE]:** "The course is rocky. Really rocky. It is a mass start race, with a 250 rider field... The race starts on a road and goes up a mile long loose gravel climb. At the top of the climb, there were only 4 of us left." (https://stevetilford.com/2010/10/25/berryman-it-was-epic-in-a-different-way/)

**Steve Tilford [COMPETITIVE]:** "The course was super dry and loose. So loose that descending was much trickier than with water running down the trail. And climbing was only a seated motion. It was nearly impossible to stand without spinning your rear wheel." (https://stevetilford.com/2010/10/25/berryman-it-was-epic-in-a-different-way/)

**Kansas City Rasta Rider [ELITE]:** "57 miles...5 hours 43 minutes...1 broken water bottle cage...1 flat tire...53rd place overall...7th place in 20-29 age grouping...1st overall finisher under the age of 25." (https://kcrastarider.blogspot.com/2010/10/berryman-epic.html)

**Kansas City Rasta Rider [ELITE]:** "So my 29r is out of commission right now due to dropout issues...this was a huge blessing as it turned out. SC let me borrow his Mad Max bike fully geared with baby wheels. I used every single stretch of gearing in this race, from granny-granny to big ring/smallest cog." (https://kcrastarider.blogspot.com/2010/10/berryman-epic.html)

**Steve Tilford [UNKNOWN]:** "The race is somewhere around 60 miles long, give or take a few miles. It is mainly on single track and horse/hiking trails. There is about 15 miles of gravel road riding mixed in. The trails are rocky. Really rocky." (https://stevetilford.com/2015/10/26/berryman-trail-epic-mtb-race/)

**Steve Tilford [UNKNOWN]:** "I passed some more and was starting to feel better riding, which was encouraging... I was riding way better. I didn't start that great, my legs weren't feeling that good and had a lower back ache. But that was all gone and I was pedalling pretty well." (https://stevetilford.com/2015/10/26/berryman-trail-epic-mtb-race/)

**Steve Tilford [UNKNOWN]:** "The race turned out to be 48 miles with 5000 feet of climbing, in a little under 4 hours." (https://stevetilford.com/2015/10/26/berryman-trail-epic-mtb-race/)

**Steve Tilford [UNKNOWN]:** "I've always said I'd rather lose a race and be riding well than win and be riding bad. So, I'll stick with that. After the race is super. They have a huge fire, free beer, a food buffet, showers, it is great. People are finishing and everyone is just catching up or telling their race stories." (https://stevetilford.com/2015/10/26/berryman-trail-epic-mtb-race/)

**Steve Tilford [UNKNOWN]:** "I guess I should start from the beginning. I was shit. And that would be an optimistic description of my pre-race feelings. I just wasn't there... But, I knew that would only be part of the equation for the day and should put in my best effort." (https://stevetilford.com/2012/10/29/the-berryman-epic-just-trying-to-maintain-is-enough-sometimes/)

**Steve Tilford [UNKNOWN]:** "This year the singletrack was covered densely with leaves. Like inches and inches. I'd bet there wasn't a total of 3 miles of the course that wasn't leaf covered. That changed the race up a ton." (https://stevetilford.com/2012/10/29/the-berryman-epic-just-trying-to-maintain-is-enough-sometimes/)

**Kate Geisen [COMPETITIVE]:** "I had a very encouraging race at the Indian Camp Creek 9-hour MTB race back at the beginning of September, riding 57 miles over the course of about 7.5 hours. The ICCP trails are significantly easier than Berryman, but I felt strong enough at the end of the day to feel like my training was in the right place." (http://kate-my-mind.blogspot.com/2015/10/bt-epic.html)

**Kate Geisen [COMPETITIVE]:** "As a result, I rolled up to the BT Epic start line with a whopping 20 bike miles for October and probably around 100 total since the Indian Camp Creek race. My training log was definitely on the hungry side." (http://kate-my-mind.blogspot.com/2015/10/bt-epic.html)

**Kate Geisen [COMPETITIVE]:** "I was redlined on climbs that I've ridden without issue in the past. Now, I had assumed I'd struggle during the race -- I've only ridden the distance on singletrack once, and Berryman is a tough trail -- but I never expected to fall apart 10 miles in." (http://kate-my-mind.blogspot.com/2015/10/bt-epic.html)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Tire Choices - Steve Tilford [COMPETITIVE]:** "I had forgotten just how rocky and technical this race is. Unbelievable. I only flatted twice in the hour we rode. I have the heaviest tires I own on my bicycle now. I've never raced a MTB bike this heavy since I won the NORBA Nationals in 1983. I can't do anything else. I have a cup of latex in each tire." (https://stevetilford.com/2010/10/22/berryman-epic-t-12-hours/)

**Tire Setup - Jim C. [UNKNOWN]:** "Try running a WTB Nano on the front, and a Maxxis CrossMark on the rear… both tubeless at about 25-28 psi. I've run this combo for years with no problems… and love it. In my opinion, the Nano is the perfect front tire, except in clay mud situations where it will pack up." (https://stevetilford.com/2010/10/22/berryman-epic-t-12-hours/)

**Flat Issues - Carey Lowery [RECREATIONAL]:** "At about mile 46 my rear tire exploded!! From the tread almost to the bead! The 'white' is an empty hammer gel packet. I had managed to lose my patch during the last tire change. Fortunately a racer named Rock stopped and gave me one of his patches. It barely covered the gaping hole." She used an empty Hammer gel packet as a tire boot. (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2010/10/berryman-epic-race-report.html)

**Gearing - Kansas City Rasta Rider [ELITE]:** "A bike with full suspension and gears may be in my future... I used every single stretch of gearing in this race, from granny-granny to big ring/smallest cog." This rider noted that having a full range of gears was essential after borrowing a fully-geared bike. (https://kcrastarider.blogspot.com/2010/10/berryman-epic.html)

**Tire Pressure - Steve Tilford [UNKNOWN]:** "I decided to let some air out of my tires since I had pumped them up pretty hard, like 30 psi (650b) and thought I might as well enjoy the rest of the ride even if it ups my flatting chances." (https://stevetilford.com/2015/10/26/berryman-trail-epic-mtb-race/)

**Suspension Setup - Steve Tilford [UNKNOWN]:** "I was having trouble with the dual suspension, not having ridden it this fast before. With all the leaves and loose rocks, when it was fully suspended, it felt like my wheels were slipping out to the side... I eventually just climbed with it fully locked out and then descended on the trail setting. That worked great." (https://stevetilford.com/2015/10/26/berryman-trail-epic-mtb-race/)

**Flat Prevention - Steve Tilford [COMPETITIVE]:** "Once you have to put a tube in riding here, it is nearly impossible to keep air in it." He noted that after getting a flat and putting in a tube, the rocky conditions made it difficult to keep air pressure. (https://stevetilford.com/2010/10/25/berryman-it-was-epic-in-a-different-way/)

**Bike Weight - Steve Tilford [UNKNOWN]:** "The race is close to 50 miles and is mostly on rocky, leaf covered singletrack. It is in the Mark Twain National Forest and is pretty hilly always." (https://stevetilford.com/2015/10/26/berryman-trail-epic-mtb-race/)

**Drop Bags - Carey Lowery [RECREATIONAL]:** "Schwag bag was also the drop bag. Once again this year, I was able to escape Mother Nature's wrath." She used her drop bag at mile 21 to grab another bottle. (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2010/10/berryman-epic-race-report.html)

## Weather Experienced

**2010 - Carey Lowery [RECREATIONAL]:** "The forecast was 70% chance of thunderstorms Friday night and on into race day. I woke up to cloudy skies and a temperature of 60 degrees ... yes!" (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2010/10/berryman-epic-race-report.html)

**2011 - Carey Lowery [ELITE]:** "Race day was brrrr! cold. I woke to temps in the low 30's; quite a shock to my system. I dressed lightly as I knew it would warm up and the start was a gravel road climb." (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2011/10/berryman-epic-race-report.html)

**2009 - Mark Gullett [ELITE]:** "I arrived at Bass River Resort, the staging area for the race on Saturday afternoon as some of the first tour riders were returning from their 55 mile ride. They were a mess and all they could talk about was how tough and wet the course was. Luckily it was nice and warm with clear skies so everyone was optimistic that a lot of the water would drain away." However, conditions remained wet. (http://www.markgullett.com/2009/10/berryman-epic-recap.html)

**2010 - Steve Tilford [COMPETITIVE]:** "And the temperature were in the lower 80's. Not good for me at this time of year." He also noted: "The course was super dry and loose." (https://stevetilford.com/2010/10/25/berryman-it-was-epic-in-a-different-way/)

**2012 - Steve Tilford [UNKNOWN]:** "I warmed up a bit, in the cool 30 degree temperatures, and realized that I didn't have it." (https://stevetilford.com/2012/10/29/the-berryman-epic-just-trying-to-maintain-is-enough-sometimes/)

**2015 - Kate Geisen [COMPETITIVE]:** "Though the forecast had threatened various amounts of rain in the week leading up to the race, we ended up with near-perfect weather: overcast and cool." (http://kate-my-mind.blogspot.com/2015/10/bt-epic.html)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Trail Surface - Carey Lowery [RECREATIONAL]:** "What made it technical in areas was the loose rocky soil, horse damage, and erosion on some of the climbs/descents. On one of the side cut sections in the first 11 miles, my front tire washed out and down I went." (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2010/10/berryman-epic-race-report.html)

**Technical Sections - Carey Lowery [RECREATIONAL]:** "The single track from the Berryman campground where I pre-rode the day before. The first couple miles was technical with ledgey drops and lots of roots. I had ridden this the day before so I was able to fly through it today." (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2010/10/berryman-epic-race-report.html)

**Creek Crossings - Mark Gullett [ELITE]:** "Before the race I found out that Zdenek Palecek (my other Burnin teammate) had bought a 2010 Specialized Epic 29er and was riding it for the race... There was a bottle neck at the creek crossing. I guess they were afraid to get their feet wet. It reminded me of the Planet Earth series where the herd of wildebeest were getting ready to cross the croc infested river and no one wanted to be the first to take the plunge!" (http://www.markgullett.com/2009/10/berryman-epic-recap.html)

**Trail Reroutes - MashOr [ELITE]:** "The Ozark Trail Association has spent countless hours re-routing the west side of Berryman that is also part of the Courtois section of the OT, bringing it up to IMBA trail construction standards and much of this work has been completed since last year's BTE. Removed were sections of trail that followed creek beds and had developed into unsustainable washes that would rattle your teeth. Added are flowing sections of benchcut trail that crosses the same creeks as before, but on solid rock faces that will stand the test of time." (https://gorctrails.com/berryman-trail-epic/)

**Brazil Creek Section - MashOr [ELITE]:** "There are plans to continue this work on the Berryman with a major re-route that will eliminate the only unridable section that drops you down 4 steep switch backs to Brazil Creek. The new trail will head over to hwy W on a less steep hillside and no longer will you have to cross the often deep Brazil Creek. This was tough to do in the winter time and keep dry feet." (https://gorctrails.com/berryman-trail-epic/)

**Sand Trap - Carey Lowery [ELITE]:** "This next section of trail was perhaps the most difficult. I encountered a 30 yard sand trap (which I ran through), a couple steep loose climbs, and a lot of 'horsed-up' sections of trail." (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2011/10/berryman-epic-race-report.html)

**Leaf Coverage - Steve Tilford [UNKNOWN]:** "This year the singletrack was covered densely with leaves. Like inches and inches. I'd bet there wasn't a total of 3 miles of the course that wasn't leaf covered. That changed the race up a ton... It started getting very hard to follow the trail. The leaves seemed thicker and there wasn't so much elevation change, so it all looked like a blanket of snow, only leaves." (https://stevetilford.com/2012/10/29/the-berryman-epic-just-trying-to-maintain-is-enough-sometimes/)

**Three Sisters/Bitches - Kate Geisen [COMPETITIVE]:** "'Lots of downhill on the Berryman, then a short stretch of Ozark Trail until you're back at Bass.' 'Yeah, and the Three Sisters,' Chuck said, referring to a series of hills also called the Three Bitches, if that gives you any idea of how fun they are." (http://kate-my-mind.blogspot.com/2015/10/bt-epic.html)

**Trail Character - Carey Lowery [RECREATIONAL]:** "The next 10 miles flew by on this sh!ts and giggles trail! I love the Berryman; no hour long granny gear climbs followed by foreverish descents. Just a constant up and down and carving through the 'S-curves.' Momentum and brake feathering are your friends." (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2010/10/berryman-epic-race-report.html)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Sub-5 Hour Pacing - Carey Lowery [RECREATIONAL]:** "11 miles in :58:47; on pace with the pain cave no where in sight... I rolled into the Berryman campground at the second checkpoint in 1:57. Mia told me that I was 17 minutes off the leaders and roughly in the top 25... I glanced down at my watch and it read 3:27:14! Oh yeah, a sub-5 hour was on the horizon. I had 16 miles to go." Due to flats, she finished at 5:33:04 but estimated a sub-5 hour finish was possible without mechanicals. (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2010/10/berryman-epic-race-report.html)

**Start Strategy - Carey Lowery [RECREATIONAL]:** "There were 3 gradual miles climbing on loose gravel before the single track so I settled into a slightly higher effort than I wanted, but knew that I could recover from." (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2010/10/berryman-epic-race-report.html)

**Nutritional Strategy - Carey Lowery [ELITE]:** "Hoping that my legs would come around, I focused on nutrition and momentum." She also noted picking up a Red Bull shot at the final campground checkpoint around mile 40. (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2011/10/berryman-epic-race-report.html)

**Pacing Mental Game - Steve Tilford [UNKNOWN]:** "I convinced myself that I was good enough to win the race, even in my pitiful state. The night before, I'd looked at the results from last year and saw that 3rd was nearly 20 minutes back on me. So, I figured that I could ride over 4 minutes an hour slower and still be competitive... I decided to just try to make it up the climbs as best as I could, without cramping and then ride all the descents super clean." (https://stevetilford.com/2012/10/29/the-berryman-epic-just-trying-to-maintain-is-enough-sometimes/)

**Breaking Down the Course - Steve Tilford [UNKNOWN]:** "I broke the rest of the course into small segments and then just tried to ride to the end of each segment and then start again. I usually don't have to make up these little games to race my bike, but this was a special situation." (https://stevetilford.com/2012/10/29/the-berryman-epic-just-trying-to-maintain-is-enough-sometimes/)

**Nutrition During Struggle - Steve Tilford [UNKNOWN]:** "I ate a ton on this road. Two full bags of cubes, two gels, and the flask of coffee. I had been feeling like I was bonking for the past couple hours, nearly from the start." He also noted: "I was so done that I ate two more caffeinated gels the last 6 miles." (https://stevetilford.com/2012/10/29/the-berryman-epic-just-trying-to-maintain-is-enough-sometimes/)

**Aid Station Efficiency - Kate Geisen [COMPETITIVE]:** "I had a few bites of Payday bar and drank some of my Carborocket before we started climbing. That was pretty much the end of the smiles for the day. I'd ridden the Berryman loop not quite a month earlier... and while my handling and descending sucked on the unfamiliar bike, I felt really strong on the climbs... BT Epic was the opposite." She noted that not eating enough in the first 10 miles contributed to her struggle. (http://kate-my-mind.blogspot.com/2015/10/bt-epic.html)

**Working Together - Mark Gullett [ELITE]:** "When we turned into the woods I followed a couple other riders for a while until a hill climb where I was able to pass and move up. Before long I found the wheel of Rock Wamsley (also on a new 29er). He was riding a good pace so I figured we could work together and we passed a few people on our way to the first checkpoint." (http://www.markgullett.com/2009/10/berryman-epic-recap.html)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Mechanical Failures - Carey Lowery [RECREATIONAL]:** Multiple flat tires are a major risk. She experienced two flats in the final 15 miles: "At mile 41 when I heard the dreaded Psssssss! and saw Stan's spewing out my rear tire... Then at mile 46 my rear tire exploded!! From the tread almost to the bead!" She lost approximately 45 minutes dealing with tire issues and needed patches from other racers. (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2010/10/berryman-epic-race-report.html)

**CO2 Failure - Carey Lowery [RECREATIONAL]:** "I then attached my CO2. And nothing. Grumble, grumble! I then attached my hand pump and made the 300 strokes to get it up to an appropriate PSI. I pinched the hell out of my palm with the pump! (Later that evening after the race, I found out why my CO2 did not work -- a broken valve stem was jammed up into the head -- WTF?!?)" (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2010/10/berryman-epic-race-report.html)

**Multiple Flats - Steve Tilford [COMPETITIVE]:** "Once you have to put a tube in riding here, it is nearly impossible to keep air in it. It took me forever to get the valve stem out. It was a super long stop... When I got back to the last feed zone/checkpoint with 19 miles to go... I made it about 5 miles, going pretty good, before I flatted again... I rode a couple more miles and flatted in a creek crossing." He experienced three flats total. (https://stevetilford.com/2010/10/25/berryman-it-was-epic-in-a-different-way/)

**Crashes - Mark Gullett [ELITE]:** His teammate Mary was sitting at the aid station "with her knees covered in blood from a crash." Others crashed as well: "Not long after getting back on the bike I was able to catch up with Rock and we rode together for the next 12 miles or so." (http://www.markgullett.com/2009/10/berryman-epic-recap.html)

**Cramping - Carey Lowery [ELITE]:** "At around mile 16, I caught up to another lady in a black/red kit (later found out this was Laura). I struggled to stay with her on the climbs... Once again, it seemed to take forever to reach the campground. Last year I reached this point in 3:27; this year it took me 3:48!" She then experienced severe hamstring cramping: "As I cranked down to get over the obstacles, my hamstrings locked up! I felt as if I had been tazed!" (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2011/10/berryman-epic-race-report.html)

**Navigation Challenges - Steve Tilford [UNKNOWN]:** "It started getting very hard to follow the trail. The leaves seemed thicker and there wasn't so much elevation change, so it all looked like a blanket of snow, only leaves. I had to stop at least 5 or 6 times and just stare into the woods. A couple times I had to walk back 50 meters or so and try to figure out where to go." (https://stevetilford.com/2012/10/29/the-berryman-epic-just-trying-to-maintain-is-enough-sometimes/)

**Bonking - Kate Geisen [COMPETITIVE]:** "Now, I had assumed I'd struggle during the race -- I've only ridden the distance on singletrack once, and Berryman is a tough trail -- but I never expected to fall apart 10 miles in. I ended up walking a lot of uphills, and my pace was pretty pathetic for many stretches that I rode. I was bewildered by the unanticipated weakness... Obviously one issue was that I hadn't eaten enough, so I tried to eat my way out of the nutritional hole I'd dug." (http://kate-my-mind.blogspot.com/2015/10/bt-epic.html)

**Derailleur Cable Issues - Steve Tilford [UNKNOWN]:** "Little did I know then that my rear derrailleur cable had slipped and I only had 3 gears in the back... I looked back and there were too many guys close for me to get off my bike and fix the problem, so I rode the next 30 minutes with just an 11-13-15, plus two in the front, 38-28. I had to dismount a few times, but it wasn't that bad." (https://stevetilford.com/2012/10/29/the-berryman-epic-just-trying-to-maintain-is-enough-sometimes/)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Post-Race Party - Steve Tilford [UNKNOWN]:** "After the race is super. They have a huge fire, free beer, a food buffet, showers, it is great. People are finishing and everyone is just catching up or telling their race stories. It is great. The awards is just a party." (https://stevetilford.com/2015/10/26/berryman-trail-epic-mtb-race/)

**Race Swag - Steve Tilford [UNKNOWN]:** "Scott and Jake go overboard. They gave out something like 30 bikes at the raffle. They give out age group awards and overall. A super time." (https://stevetilford.com/2015/10/26/berryman-trail-epic-mtb-race/)

**Prize List - Carey Lowery [RECREATIONAL]:** "Still smiling and taking $100 home for 2nd. I rolled in at 5:33:04, 15 minutes behind Catharine, but still good enough for 2nd." (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2010/10/berryman-epic-race-report.html)

**Race Organization - Carey Lowery [RECREATIONAL]:** "This race was awesome. Kudos to Scott and Ryan for a fun well-marked course, great venue, food, band, and raffle. I am already planning on the 2011 edition!" (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2010/10/berryman-epic-race-report.html)

**Venue - Kansas City Rasta Rider [ELITE]:** "Came in and was handed a beer from the tap not 2 minutes after crossing the line...sweetness. got a t-shirt, socks, $75 pair of interchangable sunglasses, drop bag, BBQ and beer for the race entry (which was free, thanks Tripp!) Damn good race, aid stations were best I've seen anywhere ever, no lie." (https://kcrastarider.blogspot.com/2010/10/berryman-epic.html)

**Community Support - Mark Gullett [ELITE]:** "There was a bottle neck at the creek crossing... Not long after the first checkpoint Rock got bogged down on a hill so I passed and decided to try to catch a few more riders. I rode behind a younger rider for a while until at the top of a pretty long climb he pulled to the side of the trail. I tried to encourage him to keep going but he said he'd follow." Later: "I came across Bob Arnold of DRJ Racing on the side of the trail. He had just fixed a flat and was having problems with his CO2. I loaned him mine and then headed back down the trail." (http://www.markgullett.com/2009/10/berryman-epic-recap.html)

**Racer Camaraderie - Carey Lowery [RECREATIONAL]:** "Fortunately a racer named Rock stopped and gave me one of his patches... Rock came by me once again and this time gave me his only tube; I had refused before as I did not want him without. He did not give me the opportunity to refuse this time, saying as he rode by and dropping the tube at my feet, 'I am tired of you passing me.' What a man!" (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2010/10/berryman-epic-race-report.html)

**Race Director Involvement - Kate Geisen [COMPETITIVE]:** "Jake, one of the race directors, came over while we were there and asked how things were going. His enthusiasm for the race and the trail were obvious, and he was all kinds of encouraging... Eventually we turned back onto the Ozark Trail and rode (walked) up a fire road to the mile 32 water station where we saw the smiling faces of Josh and his wife Shannon as well as Jake again. I'm not sure I returned any smiles at that point, but it was good to see friendly faces and very nice to see one of the race directors there even though we were basically the back of the race." (http://kate-my-mind.blogspot.com/2015/10/bt-epic.html)

**Promoter Enthusiasm - Steve Tilford [COMPETITIVE]:** "Scott and Ryan do an incredible job putting this event on. It is an unbelievable prize list. I had nearly a grand in my pocket for 3rd. And forget about the $$$, the life experience is off the charts. We stayed around and drank beer for a few hours afterwards. It was great listening to everyone's story of their day." (https://stevetilford.com/2010/10/25/berryman-it-was-epic-in-a-different-way/)

**Post-Race Atmosphere - Steve Tilford [UNKNOWN]:** "The race took just about 4 hours and I have so many memories. I love the
