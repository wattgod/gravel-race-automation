## RACE REPORTS & RIDER EXPERIENCE

**Steve Tilford's 2015 Race Report**

Professional rider Steve Tilford provided detailed commentary: "The race starts directly up a climb" and competitors immediately enter competitive action on tight, leaf-covered singletrack. Tilford noted that "the trail is very tight and was mostly covered completely with dry leaves." He described the final push: "I rode back into the Bass Resort with about 8 miles left... I felt pretty great and thought I could just maybe make that up." During the steep road climb out of the resort, he gained 45 seconds on the leader over approximately one mile[3].

**2012 Race Report**

Tilford's 2012 account described: "The race starts straight up a hard gravel climb, probably a little less than a mile long. Then a couple more miles of gradual uphill and gravel"[5].

**Course Difficulties from Participant Perspective**

One YouTube participant reported bailing out at the Berryman campground section in a previous year but returned to finish the race in 2024[4]. The final 8 miles are "notoriously hard for two reasons: one you ride right past the finish line and have to go eight miles out and two there's a steep hill and very technical terrain once you get on the single track"[4].

**Equipment & Conditions Insights**

One participant noted that the smooth rocky singletrack caused significant puncture issues for other riders, observing "punctures were hilarious that people were having"[6]. The terrain does not require aggressive downhill capability—"it really never pitched down... it just wound around... it was honestly really great trail"[6].
