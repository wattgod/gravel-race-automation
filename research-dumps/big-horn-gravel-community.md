# BIG HORN GRAVEL — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Tyler Pearce (The Vegan Cyclist) [ELITE]:** "Big Horn Gravel is the best gravel race you've never heard of" and called it "the best gravel race he's ever done." Tyler rode BOTH the 85-mile Ram's Horn Escape AND the 50-mile Little Bighorn back-to-back for a total of 130 miles and 15,000 feet of climbing. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJlE4XZN1_A, https://4iiii.com/nl/blog/great-gravel-events/)

**Dylan Johnson [ELITE]:** Finished 3rd place and described it as "Way harder than the Leadville 100, and the most money I've ever won at a race!" He created a "highly technical breakdown" of his racing strategy. (https://www.thecoyotecollective.com/bighorn-gravel, https://linktr.ee/bighorngravel)

**Howard Grotts [ELITE]:** Won the 2023 race solo, "having shaken off the contenders and proving why he is the king of high altitude." (https://www.thecoyotecollective.com/bighorn-gravel)

**Ben Delaney [ELITE]:** Created an "equipment-focused video" after participating. (https://www.thecoyotecollective.com/bighorn-gravel)

**Pete Seibert [UNKNOWN]:** A local who "showed up — he's born and raised here — and had never been on that road that goes up to Red Canyon... And he's an avid, avid biker." Co-founder Mike Brumbaugh noted "Ninety percent of last year's group, comprised of mostly Vail Valley residents, hadn't been on the opening Red Hill climb." (https://www.vaildaily.com/news/get-ready-for-gravel-cyclists-invited-to-prepare-for-the-second-bighorn-gravel-race-with-free-recon-ride-on-may-6/)

**Mike Brumbaugh (Co-founder) [UNKNOWN]:** "You get up on that Red Canyon and it's radical, man. I think it's so beautiful." Regarding the recon rides: "We had several people join us on the recon rides who weren't sure they could do Bighorn Gravel... at least a dozen flipped from no intention to pure conviction, etching their names into the inaugural year finishers' list. That to us was the biggest success story we had because we stretched people a little bit and just got them to get outside their comfort zone a little bit. And they slayed it." (https://www.vaildaily.com/news/get-ready-for-gravel-cyclists-invited-to-prepare-for-the-second-bighorn-gravel-race-with-free-recon-ride-on-may-6/)

**Unnamed local cyclists [UNKNOWN]:** Brumbaugh recently took cycling friends who "have all ridden in France and seen the Dolomites" on the route: "when we got done, every one of them was like, 'that is one of the best rides I've done in my life.' We saw an Osprey attack a bald eagle and steal a fish from him...I mean who gets to see that?!" (https://www.vaildaily.com/news/bighorn-gravel-2025-off-road-mountain-bike-race-gypsum/)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Tire Width [ALL LEVELS]:** Race organizers recommend "38mm or larger tires" for recon rides covering the Red Hill Road and Gypsum Creek Road climbs. (https://www.vaildaily.com/news/get-ready-for-gravel-cyclists-invited-to-prepare-for-the-second-bighorn-gravel-race-with-free-recon-ride-on-may-6/)

**Bike Choice Dilemma [UNKNOWN]:** One Reddit user (randy_chainsaw_) was "flip flopping" between "diverge 2x with future shock 2.0 or my new crux with mullet setup (10-51 12 speed)" for the Ram's Horn route, noting "The climbing and the amount of single track has me flip flopping (lighter crux with favorable gearing or plush/comfy diverge)." Currently running "42 pathfinders on both rigs, though may up to 45 or 47 for this route." (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/1c9sz5x/bighorn_gravel_gypsum_co/)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Course Profile - Ram's Horn Escape (85 miles):** 10,500 feet of climbing with "rugged singletrack, alpine mountain roads, and backcountry dirt." Includes "hike-a-bike" sections, "descents that will have you begging for mercy," and "some teeth chattering downhill." (https://www.bighornevents.com/, https://www.granfondoguide.com/Events/Index/10530/bighorn-gravel)

**Course Profile - Little Bighorn (50 miles):** "Only slightly less rugged" with 6,500 feet of climbing (later sources say 5,700 ft). Also includes hike-a-bike sections. (https://www.bighornevents.com/, https://www.granfondoguide.com/Events/Index/10530/bighorn-gravel)

**Specific Terrain Features:** The course includes "2.5-miles of single track through Mayflower Gulch," the "Love Connector trail" (a couple miles of singletrack), and passes through environments "from 11,000-ft. high alpine forest to sandy, scrubby rolling hills with forest service doubletrack and red earth." The course reaches an "11,000-foot high point." (https://www.vaildaily.com/news/get-ready-for-gravel-cyclists-invited-to-prepare-for-the-second-bighorn-gravel-race-with-free-recon-ride-on-may-6/, https://www.thecoyotecollective.com/bighorn-gravel, https://www.vaildaily.com/news/bighorn-gravel-2025-off-road-mountain-bike-race-gypsum/)

**Course Direction:** For 2024 and continuing, the course runs clockwise. The "final lollipop will ascend Red Hill Road and come down the paved Cottonwood Pass into the finish." Wells noted: "getting some of the Spring Creek and Love Connector (trails) in there early when people are fresh and feeling good is important." (https://www.vaildaily.com/news/bighorn-gravel-2025-off-road-mountain-bike-race-gypsum/)

**Surface Character:** Wells described climbing sections as offering "the same zen going up to the Peter Estin Hut on Spring Creek Road or taking Brush Creek to Sylvan Lake. It's in the shade, you're cruising along, you see wildflowers, moose." Then: "You get the harshness out of the way early and then you get to just settle in." (https://www.vaildaily.com/news/bighorn-gravel-2025-off-road-mountain-bike-race-gypsum/)

**2023 Course Changes:** Eliminated the "bone-jarring descent down the Powerline trail" in favor of "2.5-miles of single track through Mayflower Gulch" to provide "mid-race relief after the picturesque — but long — climb up Gypsum Creek Road." (https://www.vaildaily.com/news/get-ready-for-gravel-cyclists-invited-to-prepare-for-the-second-bighorn-gravel-race-with-free-recon-ride-on-may-6/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**High Altitude Training Value [ELITE]:** Brumbaugh noted: "What we're hearing is this is also one of the best training races for Leadville because you get the altitude." The race is "perfectly positioned in the off-road calendar for athletes training for marquee races like Crusher in the Tushar, the Leadville 100 or Steamboat Gravel. It's the first opportunity to get some high-altitude racing in." (https://www.vaildaily.com/news/get-ready-for-gravel-cyclists-invited-to-prepare-for-the-second-bighorn-gravel-race-with-free-recon-ride-on-may-6/, https://www.vaildaily.com/news/bighorn-gravel-2025-off-road-mountain-bike-race-gypsum/)

**Aid Station Strategy [ELITE]:** 2023 women's winner Michaela Thompson "skipped the final aid station, passing Olympian Erin Huck" to secure the win. (https://www.thecoyotecollective.com/bighorn-gravel)

**Early Move Success [ELITE]:** Howard Grotts "came in solo, having shaken off the contenders" rather than waiting for a sprint finish. (https://www.thecoyotecollective.com/bighorn-gravel)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Inclusivity Mission:** Co-founder Brumbaugh stated: "Inclusivity is the big buzz word right now... if you're a human being, we want you out riding a bike and having a good time. Yeah, we're psyched to have some really top notch pros show up, but what we're really psyched about is every rider comparing themselves with the man in the mirror... I'm just out here doing the best I can. I leave it on the course today and if I did, I can be proud of that. That's certainly what we want to do with Bighorn." (https://www.vaildaily.com/news/get-ready-for-gravel-cyclists-invited-to-prepare-for-the-second-bighorn-gravel-race-with-free-recon-ride-on-may-6/)

**Community Support:** Brumbaugh emphasized: "The support we have from the community and the government is just — Jake and I look at each other and say, 'what did we do to deserve this?' — because it's pretty amazing." He noted the "stoke level" of "everyone involved, from the volunteers and vendors to the police escorts and the Town of Gypsum" as his favorite part. Town council "love the biking community. They love the event and what the spirit of gravel is all about." (https://www.vaildaily.com/news/bighorn-gravel-2025-off-road-mountain-bike-race-gypsum/)

**Expo & Post-Race:** Saturday features "expo and packet pick-up" with sponsor events including a "Kids Balance Bike Race" (moved to 2pm for nap time consideration). There's "live music, food trucks, beer" and various sponsor prizes. Last place finishers win the "Ibex Winners" prize. The event includes "onsite van camping" with "Dave and Matt Vans serving as the official van partner" - 100 free spots available with "showers and bathrooms." (https://www.vaildaily.com/news/get-ready-for-gravel-cyclists-invited-to-prepare-for-the-second-bighorn-gravel-race-with-free-recon-ride-on-may-6/, https://www.thecoyotecollective.com/bighorn-gravel, https://www.bighornevents.com/)

**Recon Ride Program:** Free recon rides offered pre-race. In 2022, organizers "thought we'd get 10 people to show up, and we had 40 or 50." Brumbaugh noted these helped people gain confidence: "We had several people join us on the recon rides who weren't sure they could do Bighorn Gravel" but then completed the race. At the Pinarello-sponsored recon, the bike brand "will bring some of its own riders and prizes." (https://www.vaildaily.com/news/get-ready-for-gravel-cyclists-invited-to-prepare-for-the-second-bighorn-gravel-race-with-free-recon-ride-on-may-6/)

**Prize Structure:** $10,000 prize purse split between top finishers. As of 2025, top-5 finishers in both men's and women's open class receive: $2,500, $1,200, $750, $500, $300. "Top male and female single-speed riders and tandem team" also receive prizes. Unique feature: "cash prize to the last riders to complete the course" (Ibex Winners).

**Elite Field Depth:** 2023 attracted "former Olympians, Leadville 100 champions and LifeTime Grand Prix stars." 2025 women's field includes Karolina Migon (fresh Unbound Gravel 200 winner), Emily Newsom, Erin Huck (2024 Olympian), Lauren Stephens (3x Unbound 100 winner), Raylyn Nuss, and Lauren De Crescenzo (2021 Unbound 200 champion). Men's side features Cobe Freeburn and Alex Howes (2x Tour de France finisher). (https://www.vaildaily.com/news/bighorn-gravel-2025-off-road-mountain-bike-race-gypsum/)
