## TERRAIN & COURSE

### Overall Course Character
- "Eagle County does not have much 'Champagne Gravel' - think more rugged backcountry forest roads"
- Mixed surfaces: forest service roads, technical singletrack, fire roads
- Some roads receive little to no maintenance and can be "quite primitive"
- In rain, gravel/dirt roads become mud roads

### Surface Breakdown
- Vast majority on dirt, gravel, and forest service roads
- Some blacktop/paved sections necessary between gravel sections
- Technical singletrack sections
- "Moon dust" on fire roads
- Steep fire roads with deep loose material

### Key Climbing Features
- **The Big One:** 18-mile grinder with 4,000 feet of elevation gain (single climb)
- Course tops out above 11,000 feet elevation
- Includes "hike-a-bike or two" sections
- Descents "that will have you begging for mercy"

### Course Direction
- 2024-2026: Clockwise direction
- Final lollipop now ascends Red Hill Road and descends paved Cottonwood Pass to finish
- Early course includes Spring Creek and Love Connector trails "when people are fresh"

### Bike Choice Dilemma
Per organizers: "If you're on a mountain bike, you'll be happy, if you're on a gravel bike, you'll be happy. But at some point in the race - no matter what you're on - you'll wish you were on a different bike, which I think is the perfect gravel course."

### Tire Recommendations
- **Minimum width:** 38mm recommended
- **Tire liners:** Recommended for added puncture protection
- **Tubeless:** Standard for gravel racing
- Course has high-speed ripping descents that demand wider tires

### Elevation Profile Summary
| Distance | Total Climbing | Max Elevation |
|----------|----------------|---------------|
| 85 miles | 10,500 ft | 11,000+ ft |
| 50 miles | 6,500 ft | TBD |
| 20 miles | ~2,000 ft | TBD |

## BLACK PILL (Brutal Truths)

### The Course Will Humble You
1. **10,500 feet of climbing in 85 miles** - That's ~123 ft/mile average, with concentrated climbs
2. **Single 18-mile climb with 4,000 ft gain** - Your legs will beg for mercy
3. **Tops out above 11,000 feet** - Oxygen is ~33% less than sea level
4. **Hike-a-bike sections are REQUIRED** - Not optional, not avoidable

### Altitude Will Wreck You If Unprepared
- Sea-level athletes WILL suffer more
- Symptoms: headaches, nausea, fatigue, dizziness, shortness of breath
- Can appear 6-24 hours after arrival
- Pre-acclimatization strongly recommended (3+ days at altitude)

### Terrain Reality Check
- NO "champagne gravel" - forget your smooth crushed limestone dreams
- "Primitive" roads with little to no maintenance
- High-speed descents on rough surfaces
- Your bike choice will feel WRONG at some point

### Environmental Hazards
- **Moon dust:** Fine powder that clogs everything and offers zero traction
- **Unpredictable winds:** Can turn a climb into a survival exercise
- **Heat + dust + altitude:** Triple threat for dehydration
- **Remote location:** Long distances between aid stations (up to 17 miles)

### Mechanical Risk
- Tire liners recommended - puncture risk is REAL
- 38mm minimum tire width - skinnier tires asking for trouble
- Rough descents destroy equipment
- Self-supported sections mean YOU fix your problems

### The Competition
- Field includes Olympians, national champions, and LifeTime Grand Prix pros
- If you're racing for results, you're racing against the best
- Sub-5 hour winning times mean elite pace of ~17+ mph with 10K climbing

### Self-Sufficiency Required
- "Participants are solely responsible for their personal well-being"
- "Will have to make their own informed decisions, and suffer the consequences"
- Remote White River National Forest - rescue takes TIME

### Weather Can Flip
- Morning temps in 30s F, midday 80s F - massive swing
- Afternoon thunderstorms possible
- Mud turns course into survival mode
- High winds can appear without warning

### Historical DNF Factors
- Flat tires (Eric Brunner 2022 - was leading)
- Mechanical failures on rough terrain
- Altitude sickness
- Bonking on extended climbs
- Insufficient nutrition/hydration planning

## GRAVEL GOD RATINGS

### Overall Difficulty: 9.5/10
One of the most demanding gravel races in Colorado. The combination of 10,500 ft climbing, 11,000 ft max elevation, hike-a-bike sections, and rugged terrain makes this elite-level suffering.

### Terrain Technical Rating: 8/10
Not a pure gravel race - includes singletrack, hike-a-bike, and primitive forest roads. Demands bike handling skills beyond smooth gravel.

### Fitness Requirement: 9/10
Sub-5 hour winning times with 10K climbing requires exceptional fitness. Average finisher will be out 6-8+ hours.

### Altitude Challenge: 9/10
Starting at 7,000 ft, maxing above 11,000 ft. Sea-level athletes will suffer significantly without acclimatization.

### Weather Variability: 7/10
June is generally favorable, but wind, dust, and potential thunderstorms add uncertainty. Temperature swings of 40+ degrees possible.

### Scenic Beauty: 10/10
White River National Forest, Colorado high country, alpine views. Worth the suffering for the scenery alone.

### Community/Vibes: 8/10
Growing but intimate event. Welcoming atmosphere, not trying to be massive. Strong finisher celebration culture.

### Pro Field Depth: 8/10
Attracts Olympians, LifeTime Grand Prix athletes, and national champions. Not Unbound-level depth but serious competition.

### Self-Sufficiency Demand: 8/10
Long gaps between aid stations, remote terrain, primitive roads. Must be prepared to handle problems solo.

### Equipment Abuse Factor: 8/10
Rough descents, moon dust, primitive roads. Bikes take a beating. Tire liners and wider tires essential.

### Overall Gravel God Score: 8.5/10
A premiere Colorado gravel event that punishes the unprepared and rewards the strong. Not for beginners - this is a proper suffer-fest with world-class views.
