## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Hailey Peterson [ELITE]:** "I was already fatigued, disheartened, supremely worried I couldn't tackle this race, and honestly a mental half step away from tears of frustration... A hug from my coach and friend... with reassurance that he was in the same situation gave me hope. The reality was that air conditions were abysmal all day. California smoke was heavy in the air. The Tobacco Root Mountains that are normally readily viewable had been entirely obscured. My chest wall became tender to the touch from the act of trying to breathe." (https://www.hpultracycling.com/big-sky-spectaculaire-race-report/)

**Hailey Peterson [ELITE]:** "Day 1: 225 miles in 15hrs 34min, Normalized Power(149 watts)... My heart rate had been markedly higher than anticipated all day. I'd done this climb before and performed much better... If I backed off, my power would be in the toilet, but if I pressed on would I secure a fate that could end my race? At my current slow pace, I had plenty of time to ponder over the matter." (https://www.hpultracycling.com/big-sky-spectaculaire-race-report/)

**Hailey Peterson [ELITE]:** "The highlight of the day was Burma Road. It was a lovely gravel road following the Big Hole River. The views were superb. A herd of bighorn sheep were grazing in an irrigated field. It was rocky, hilly perfection and just what I needed. I didn't need the truck spraying water all over the road that splattered me and my drivetrain for miles, but the mental reset was all my gravel-loving heart needed and more."

**Anonymous [COMPETITIVE]:** "Nervous or worried? Don't hesitate to reach out. We're happy to answer as many questions as needed to make you feel comfortable on the starting line!" (https://www.redlodgeevents.com/bigskygravel)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Hailey Peterson [ELITE]:** Used a 2016 Salsa Warbird with Maxxis Rambler 40mm tires set up tubeless. She notes: "What I should tell you is that you should choose a smooth tread tire for this predominantly paved event. That is the right answer. However, the 120tpi Ramblers are a supple tire with enough tread to absolutely bomb gravel and yet roll quite smoothly on pavement. This route had nearly 200 miles of gravel. The Ramblers gave me confidence and so I stuck with my known and loved entity. I had to have some extra and unnecessary drag due to the tread, and it probably added a few minutes to my overall time." (https://www.hpultracycling.com/big-sky-spectaculaire-race-report/)

**Hailey Peterson [ELITE]:** Bag setup included "waterproof Revelate seat bag, seat tube bag, top tube bag and Specialized partial frame bag (Side note is that the Specialized bag is rated as water resistant, but I find it pretty much waterproof). I had two 21oz Camelbak bottles, a third 21oz bottle for extra water needs/parts etc. and a 2.5L Camelbak hydration pack." (https://www.hpultracycling.com/big-sky-spectaculaire-race-report/)

**Hailey Peterson [ELITE]:** On shelter choices: "In hindsight, I would have taken a minimalist bivy shelter in place of a tent for the flexibility of camping, but this route has plenty of lodging options. I chose a bed every night to get better sleep and hopefully perform better over long days. I was glad to know I had shelter if needed. I lugged 3-4 pounds around for 968 miles that I did not need. Oof!" (https://www.hpultracycling.com/big-sky-spectaculaire-race-report/)

**Hailey Peterson [ELITE]:** "I did use an Ice Friction chain. It was my first experience and superb. The chain was flawless and smooth the entire race." (https://www.hpultracycling.com/big-sky-spectaculaire-race-report/)

**Hailey Peterson [ELITE]:** "I used all apparel and gear except my tent. I used no repair tools thanks to the careful inspection and care from Kyle's Bikes." (https://www.hpultracycling.com/big-sky-spectaculaire-race-report/)

Air quality paired with the heat of the day made for an incredibly challenging environment... California smoke was heavy in the air. The Tobacco Root Mountains that are normally readily viewable had been entirely obscured. My chest wall became tender to the touch from the act of trying to breathe." Additionally: "We encountered some rain and started to struggle a bit on the long climb to Virginia City." (https://www.hpultracycling.com/big-sky-spectaculaire-race-report/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

Janie's words of caution regarding elevated heart rate and the bad omen of possible poor performance in the days to come echoed in my head. If I backed off, my power would be in the toilet, but if I pressed on would I secure a fate that could end my race? At my current slow pace, I had plenty of time to ponder over the matter.
