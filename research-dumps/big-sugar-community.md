# BIG SUGAR — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Keegan Swenson [ELITE]:** "Today was a tricky and tactical race; I had no choice but to give it all I had, but I knew I was going to be up against it. It's been a great year, but some of my races didn't go as I wanted; but that's cycling." (https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/divying-up-dollars-and-snaring-spots-for-2026-as-big-sugar-classic-settles-life-time-grand-prix-overall-standings-for-fourth-time/)

**Alexey Vermeulen [ELITE]:** "Rode well, finished 14th on the day and 6th overall - not the end I dreamed of, but that's bike racing. Very happy for Matt Beers and Cameron Jones, it ain't easy to be that far away from home." (https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/divying-up-dollars-and-snaring-spots-for-2026-as-big-sugar-classic-settles-life-time-grand-prix-overall-standings-for-fourth-time/)

**Cecily Decker [ELITE]:** "It was full gas from the start, I felt pretty good and was happy where I was, but midway through the day, I felt like it was going to end in a bunch sprint. Melisa and I were really tight on points, so I'm really happy to have got it just at the end." (https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/divying-up-dollars-and-snaring-spots-for-2026-as-big-sugar-classic-settles-life-time-grand-prix-overall-standings-for-fourth-time/)

**Payson McElveen [ELITE]:** "The early break was long gone by 10 miles in, but there was still much to fight for in the Life Time Grand Prix overall. Didn't have the legs to sneak around Cole Paton in the big scrum of 26 of us sprinting for the line, so he took 10th place on the series, and I ended up 11th." Also noted he "tangled" with TV motos, then a photographer and crashed within 20 minutes of the finish. (https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/divying-up-dollars-and-snaring-spots-for-2026-as-big-sugar-classic-settles-life-time-grand-prix-overall-standings-for-fourth-time/)

**Sarah Lange [ELITE]:** "I've learned a lot about race strategy this year. Despite a subpar result on the day, I was able to hang on for an overall at Life Time Grand Prix top 10 result giving me something to celebrate despite the disappointing result here in Bentonville." Noted "three plugs and some CO2 left her chasing after a flat tyre at mile 10 of Big Sugar to secure her first top 10." (https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/divying-up-dollars-and-snaring-spots-for-2026-as-big-sugar-classic-settles-life-time-grand-prix-overall-standings-for-fourth-time/)

**TexanDad [COMPETITIVE]:** "Coming from road racing background, I thought I wanted a gravel race bike with a somewhat aggressive position and 'sporty' handling. And it was great on tamer gravel courses, but scary as hell on technical descents and not great on singletrack sections." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/big-sugar-2024-thread/96900)

**TexanDad [COMPETITIVE]:** "I will say if I were to compare this year's Unbound 100 and the Big Sugar 100 for difficulty, Big Sugar surpasses Unbound by a great margin. The gravel was a mix of sharp, protruding rocks from the surface and underground (much like the Flint Hills), but the pea gravel was EVERYWHERE and especially at the bottom of some very technical descents." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/big-sugar-2024-thread/96900)

**TexanDad [COMPETITIVE]:** "It's my A race but it's just me vs me, I will fight hard for podiums at local events but I figure with over 1000 riders I'm just trying to put in my fastest gravel century yet... I'll take the descents at a safe pace as I'm from North Texas and we don't get the opportunity to send it down long steep gravel often. I'll have my wife and 3 boys with me so I'll need both collarbones after the race." Target: under 7 hours. (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/big-sugar-2024-thread/96900)

**Power13 [COMPETITIVE]:** "My biggest tip is for the descents…don't watch the riders in front of you and make sure you are looking through the turns. Lots of riders get radar lock on the outside of the turns…especially the off-camber ones. They end up going wide and into the other side of the road. Keep your head up and look through the turns and to where you want to go." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/big-sugar-2024-thread/96900)

**csoechting2 [COMPETITIVE]:** "This year is my third year on the line... 40s on my old bike just made me feel way too under-tired on the descents. New rig rolls up to 50s but I will likely be on 45 Rambler silk shields." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/big-sugar-2024-thread/96900)

**KCBikeNerd [COMPETITIVE]:** "Just when things hit like 18% or more with loose terrain I will have trouble with. Was tempted to get a 38 or 40 [chainring] but eh... Had one [descent] this year that for some reason really spooked me, super steep and loose but handled it fine while yelling 'im gonna die!' then proceeded to not die. Just feels weird when the bike sloshes around on loose crap." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/big-sugar-2024-thread/96900)

**Kuttermax [COMPETITIVE]:** "I've never seen more flats than at Big Sugar, and that includes Unbound. In Year 1 there were people at the side of the road fixing flats from the moment it hit the gravel. After that it was a steady parade of people fixing flats the whole time the race was on the gravel portion." Also noted: "In Year 1 Pete Stetina had enough tire problems that at Aid Station 2 he stopped and had a beer…" (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/big-sugar-2024-thread/96900)

**grwoolf [COMPETITIVE]:** "I've never done big sugar, but I have ridden the gravel around bentonville a bit and there is legit chunk on that course. I'd recommend the widest tire your bike allows. Course also includes a good bit of punchy climbing, so it's a good course for mullet gearing IMO." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/big-sugar-2024-thread/96900)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

### Tires (by rider level)

**[ELITE] Matt Beers (Winner 2025):** Specifics not disclosed in sources, but won on shortened 50-mile course in 2:12:55.

**[COMPETITIVE] Power13:** "I raced it 2 years ago and ran Maxxis Ramblers in 45 w/ inserts…zero issues. Since then, I have ridden a fair amount down there with a number of different tire setups - pathfinder 47's (which measured 45), 650b w/ a Thunderburt 2.1's and even tubed Panaracer Gravel Kings in 32 (While I had zero issues with this setup, it is definitely NOT recommended for race day.) As noted above, just run the widest tires you can. Anything above a 42 will be fine." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/big-sugar-2024-thread/96900)

**[COMPETITIVE] TexanDad:** Started with S-works 42s Pathfinder as "go to tire in Texas," tested Pathfinder Pro 47s before the race. "The 47 pros ride softer because of lower psi, otherwise they ride pretty similar to the 42s, didn't notice a whole lot of extra traction, so I'm not 100% on them for the race yet." Ultimately mounted "Pathfinder Pro 47s with fresh sealant" for the race. Running Wolf Tooth 44t x 10-52 gearing. (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/big-sugar-2024-thread/96900)

**[COMPETITIVE] csoechting2:** Planning to run "45 Rambler silk shields" after feeling "way too under-tired on the descents" with 40s previously. (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/big-sugar-2024-thread/96900)

**[COMPETITIVE] Kuttermax:** Year 1: "Rene Herse Hurricane Ridge 42s in Endurance Casing. Had one flat a mile or two before the second aid station." Year 2: "Pathfinder Pro 42s with inserts. No flats." Year 3 plan: "Conti Race King 2.2s, no inserts." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/big-sugar-2024-thread/96900)

**[COMPETITIVE] grwoolf:** For non-competitive finish on full-suspension XC MTB: "planning to... run 2.2 conti race kings." If racing hard: "I'd be on my gravel bike w/ 47 pathfinders, mullet drivetrain with 44t chainring." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/big-sugar-2024-thread/96900)

**[COMPETITIVE] Joe:** "I'm going challenge strada Bianca 45 front, thunder Burt 2.25 rear with inserts both ends." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/big-sugar-2024-thread/96900)

**[COMPETITIVE] KCBikeNerd:** "Im too cheap to buy new tires for it, so im on 42mm cannonballs." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/big-sugar-2024-thread/96900)

**[COMPETITIVE] atdaberry:** Looking for "fast-ish 2.1's to run on my MOG for Big Sugar. I have some thunderburts but the traction when cornering just isn't working for me. They puncture pretty easily too." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/big-sugar-2024-thread/96900)

### Gearing

**[COMPETITIVE] TexanDad:** Wolf Tooth 44t chainring x 10-52 cassette (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/big-sugar-2024-thread/96900)

**[COMPETITIVE] grwoolf (if racing hard):** "mullet drivetrain with 44t chainring" (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/big-sugar-2024-thread/96900)

**[COMPETITIVE] grwoolf (for casual MTB finish):** "I'll max out the chainring w/ a 38t" on full-suspension XC bike (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/big-sugar-2024-thread/96900)

**[COMPETITIVE] KCBikeNerd:** "42t oval with 11-40t rear" - expressed concern about "hills... like 18% or more with loose terrain" (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/big-sugar-2024-thread/96900)

### Bike Choice

**[COMPETITIVE] grwoolf:** "planning to ride my FS XC mountain bike for comfort and reduced stress" for casual finish, noting "If I was racing hard, I'd be on my gravel bike" (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/big-sugar-2024-thread/96900)

**[COMPETITIVE] TexanDad:** '23 Crux gravel bike with room for 47mm tires. Could fit Conti 2.0s but "I hear they're not nearly as good as the 2.2s." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/big-sugar-2024-thread/96900)

### Aerobars

**Rules conflict noted:** Multiple riders reported conflicting information. One rider stated they saw "People were running aero bars last year. I intend to roll with them." However, another checked the athlete guide and confirmed "they are not allowed... I just assumed they were fine since Lifetime allows them at Unbound." Kuttermax noted seeing "someone riding with a solid disk rear wheel... he had aerobars, too" and made "an effort to get as far away from him as I could." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/big-sugar-2024-thread/96900)

Official rules from the website state: "MAY NOT utilize aerobars, bar extensions, or clip on bar attachments of any kind" (https://www.bigsugarclassic.com/gravel/)

### Mandatory Equipment

Per official rules: "Cycling computer or GPS device, Minimum of two liters of water or sports drink, Two spare inner tubes, Air pump or inflation system, A cell phone" (https://www.bigsugarclassic.com/gravel/)

## Weather Experienced

**2025 Race:** Race shortened from 100 miles to 50 miles within an hour of the start due to violent storms, tornado warnings, and lightning. "The rumblings of course alterations began on Thursday and intensified as the reality of the weather became more and more apparent." Rain started "in the last hour of the action." Area was "under a tornado watch." One source described "wet and miserable conditions as dangerous hailstorms, lightning and tornados threatened." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/results-big-sugar-gravel-2025-beers-gomez-villafane/ and https://granfondodailynews.com/2025/10/19/big-sugar-gravel-and-mud-results-sweet-victory-for-villafane-beers/)

**Year 1 (2021 or 2022):** "it rained a bit during the race but otherwise was nice" (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/big-sugar-2024-thread/96900)

**Year 2:** "brutal headwind that made the ride south back to Bentonville in the last quarter of the race quite a slog." Also noted as having "dry conditions that year and all the dust that covered the rocks" which "many attributed" to fewer flats. (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/big-sugar-2024-thread/96900)

**2024 conditions (pre-race forecast):** Multiple riders reported "I've heard from several buddies that live up there that it's dry, and appears it will stay dry" (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/big-sugar-2024-thread/96900)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Early Course Character:** "There is a pretty long paved roll out from town, but when it hits the gravel it's on. There are some fast descents with tight turns in some of the early bits and I saw numerous crashes. In Year 1 Ted King crashed out early and broke his arm in one of these section. Famously Floyd Landis stopped to help him after." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/big-sugar-2024-thread/96900)

**First Gravel Section:** "the J street drop first thing out of town caught me off guard for sure! I was pretty nervous for the remaining 40 or so miles of that ride but we never ran into anything quite like that the rest of the way." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/big-sugar-2024-thread/96900)

**Gravel Surface:** "The gravel was a mix of sharp, protruding rocks from the surface and underground (much like the Flint Hills), but the pea gravel was EVERYWHERE and especially at the bottom of some very technical descents and on areas where..." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/big-sugar-2024-thread/96900)

**Technical Difficulty Distribution:** "From what I remember most of the more technical stuff is in the first half." However, another rider noted: "More like the last half!!" referring to brutal conditions. (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/big-sugar-2024-thread/96900)

**Climbing Character:** "Course also includes a good bit of punchy climbing" (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/big-sugar-2024-thread/96900)

**Official Description:** "Canopy covered gravel roads will lead you through the remote and rugged highlands of the Ozark Mountains in Northwest Arkansas and Southern Missouri. The courses go along Sugar Creek and through the bluffs and hollers, including picturesque fall foliage... rarely maintained roads with loose, rocky gravel, a few pavement sections and a few water crossings and bridges." (https://www.bigsugarclassic.com/gravel/)

**Elevation Gain:** 
- 100-mile: ~6,200'
- 50-mile: ~3,000'
- 25-mile: ~1,500'
(https://www.bigsugarclassic.com/gravel/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**[ELITE] 2025 Shortened Race (50 miles):** "Without much distance to play with" after the course was cut, early breakaway was decisive. Leaders crossed first aid station at mile 29 "an hour and ten minutes into the day." Matt Beers won in 2:12:55 (24.38 mph average). Sofia Gomez Villafañe won women's in 2:36:23 (20.72 mph average). (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/results-big-sugar-gravel-2025-beers-gomez-villafane/)

**[ELITE] Men's 2025 Race Dynamics:** "The race dutifully kicked off with fury as the leaders crossed the mat of the first and only aid station at mile 29 an hour and ten minutes into the day." Early break formed in first 10 miles with Beers, Amos, and Wilson. "Behind, the close race for the men's overall kept most of the strongest riders closely marking one another behind, hindering the chase." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/results-big-sugar-gravel-2025-beers-gomez-villafane/)

**[ELITE] Women's 2025 Race Dynamics:** "The women's peloton stayed stuck together throughout the first half of the race. Over and over again, one rider would attack only to be brought back... a group of around 15 women were still in the mix" before final climbs. Gomez Villafañe "broke the stalemate just out of sight of the line with a massive sprint." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/results-big-sugar-gravel-2025-beers-gomez-villafane/)

**[COMPETITIVE] Target Pacing:** TexanDad shooting for "under 7 hours" on 100-mile course (14.3 mph average if successful). (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/big-sugar-2024-thread/96900)

**[COMPETITIVE] Descent Strategy:** "don't watch the riders in front of you and make sure you are looking through the turns. Lots of riders get radar lock on the outside of the turns…especially the off-camber ones. They end up going wide and into the other side of the road... once you do, you have no choice but to just ride it out, which will mean also crossing to the other side of the road." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/big-sugar-2024-thread/96900)

**[COMPETITIVE] Descent Mindset:** "as long as I keep the front tire weighted and point the bike where I want it to go the bike will do most of the work. It's never going to feel stable because you're on a surface that is moving against itself while your bike tires move against it…" (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/big-sugar-2024-thread/96900)

**[ELITE] Nutrition Note:** Sarah Lange experienced "three plugs and some CO2 left her chasing after a flat tyre at mile 10" - no specific nutrition data but indicates importance of carrying repair supplies. (https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/divying-up-dollars-and-snaring-spots-for-2026-as-big-sugar-classic-settles-life-time-grand-prix-overall-standings-for-fourth-time/)

**Cutoff Times (100-mile):** 
- Pineville checkpoint (mile 37): 12:00 PM cutoff
- Rockford Grange (mile 73): 4:00 PM cutoff
- Based on "an average of 10 mph"
(https://www.bigsugarclassic.com/gravel/)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Flats - Catastrophic Issue:** "I've never seen more flats than at Big Sugar, and that includes Unbound. In Year 1 there were people at the side of the road fixing flats from the moment it hit the gravel. After that it was a steady parade of people fixing flats the whole time the race was on the gravel portion. In Year 2 it was a little better and many attributed to the dry conditions that year and all the dust that covered the rocks." Pete Stetina "had enough tire problems that at Aid Station 2 he stopped and had a beer." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/big-sugar-2024-thread/96900)

**Crashes on Technical Descents:** "There are some fast descents with tight turns in some of the early bits and I saw numerous crashes. In Year 1 Ted King crashed out early and broke his arm in one of these section." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/big-sugar-2024-thread/96900)

**Late-Race Mechanicals [ELITE]:** Matthew Wilson "was unable to follow Beers after suffering from a large cut in his tire with just a few kilometers remaining" in 2025, costing him second place. (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/results-big-sugar-gravel-2025-beers-gomez-villafane/)

**Rider Skill Variability:** "There is also a huge variability in the skill of the riders which is important to keep in mind. There were a lot of 'roadies' who were really upright and stiff legged on the descents, but they are usually pretty easy to spot and avoid. It's mostly an issue early before things start to get stretched out." Also noted: "there was someone riding with a solid disk rear wheel and real skinny tires" - rider made "an effort to get as far away from him as I could." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/big-sugar-2024-thread/96900)

**Cutoff Risk:** Official cutoffs based on 10 mph average - riders reaching checkpoints after cutoff time "will not be scored and you will no longer be an official participant of the race." (https://www.bigsugarclassic.com/gravel/)

**Support Crew Rules:** "IF A SUPPORT CREW VEHICLE IS SPOTTED ON COURSE, THEIR RIDER WILL BE DISQUALIFIED." Support only allowed at Pineville and Rockford Grange checkpoints on 100-mile course. (https://www.bigsugarclassic.com/gravel/)

**Weather-Related Cancellation Risk:** 2025 race shortened from 100 to 50 miles due to severe weather, demonstrating course can be significantly altered on race day. (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/results-big-sugar-gravel-2025-beers-gomez-villafane/)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Field Size:** "with over 1000 riders" mentioned by competitive rider. 2025 race had "Just over 1700 riders from across the United States and many world destinations finished the weather challenged gravel 'n mud race." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/big-sugar-2024-thread/96900 and https://granfondodailynews.com/2025/10/19/big-sugar-gravel-and-mud-results-sweet-victory-for-villafane-beers/)

**Town Character:** "Bentonville has become an awesome town." The finish festival takes place at "Downtown Bentonville" and includes "Bentonville Farmers Market" during race morning. (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/big-sugar-2024-thread/96900 and https://www.bigsugarclassic.com/gravel/)

Big Sugar itself has "$30,000 USD prize purse" for the gravel race. (https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/divying-up-dollars-and-snaring-spots-for-2026-as-big-sugar-classic-settles-life-time-grand-prix-overall-standings-for-fourth-time/ and https://granfondodailynews.com/2025/10/19/big-sugar-gravel-and-mud-results-sweet-victory-for-villafane-beers/)

**Biketober:** "Each October, Bentonville transforms into a global hub for riders as the Big Sugar Classic takes center stage. This isn't just a race—it's a week-long experience filled with epic gravel events, scenic group rides, and unforgettable community moments." (https://www.visitbentonville.com/blog/stories/post/life-time-big-sugar-classic/)
