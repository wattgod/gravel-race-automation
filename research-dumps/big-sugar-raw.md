## Gear & Equipment Recommendations

### Tire Recommendations

**For Average/Age-Group Riders:**
- 38-42mm semi-slick with decent side knobs
- 47mm versions ride softer due to lower PSI

**Pro/Elite Choices (2025):**
- Matt Beers (winner): 50mm Specialized Pathfinder TLR
- Keegan Swenson: 50mm Maxxis Rambler front and rear
- 4/5 top men and 5/5 top women on MTB tires

**Popular Options:**
- S-Works Specialized Pathfinder 42mm or 47mm
- Teravail Cannonball 650x47mm (durable casing)
- 45mm Maxxis Rambler
- Course suited to big tires (extra volume helps on rough terrain)

### Tire Protection
- "Death by a thousand cuts" for tires
- More flats observed than at UNBOUND
- Riders swap lightweight race tires for puncture-resistant casing
- Roads pocketed with fist-sized rock and pea gravel descents

### Gearing
- Pro choice: 46T chainring with 10-52T 12-speed cassette

- Another option: 48x10-50t

### Pedals

## Race Strategy & Tips

### Pacing
- "The secret to doing well is staying bored as long as you can"
- Be realistic about goal and fitness
- Don't chase early - pay off comes when catching them later
- Races usually come down to who has something left at end
- Long and attritional - focus on efficiency and saving energy

### Start Strategy
- Tempting to roll slowly off start line, but pay to go out hard initially
- Use speed of groups to put good miles behind you
- Stay with people you can work with later
- Starting too conservatively = being strongest in weaker groups

### Bike Handling
- Stay loose and relaxed (tension = getting beat up more)
- Let bike find the line, stay nimble in saddle
- Keep upper body loose
- Gravel handling takes practice even for experienced road/MTB riders

### Nutrition
- Separate hydration from energy (water/electrolytes vs gels/chews)
- Adjust fluid based on intensity and temperature
- Reduces gastric distress chances
- Over long races, sugar-heavy nutrition can backfire
- Pack "real food" for first half (bagel with PB, savory flapjacks)

### Equipment Prep
- Feet will get wet regardless of weather (multiple water crossings)
- Prepare for flat tire contingencies
