**Sam Brown [ELITE]:** Fourth place finisher in 2024, returns in 2025 to compete for the expanded prize purse. "Eagle's Sam Brown tries to catch back up to the lead group during the 2024 Bighorn Gravel event." (https://www.vaildaily.com/news/bighorn-gravel-2025-off-road-mountain-bike-race-gypsum/)

**Mike Brumbaugh [UNKNOWN - Race Co-Founder]:** "It's in the shade, you're cruising along, you see wildflowers, moose. You get the harshness out of the way early and then you get to just settle in." Describing the Brush Creek to Sylvan Lake climb. (https://www.vaildaily.com/news/bighorn-gravel-2025-off-road-mountain-bike-race-gypsum/)

**Mike Brumbaugh [UNKNOWN - Race Co-Founder]:** "From day one we've said, if you're on a mountain bike, you'll be happy, if you're on a gravel bike, you'll be happy. But at some point in the race — no matter what you're on — you'll wish you were on a different bike, which I think is the perfect gravel course." (https://www.vaildaily.com/news/checking-all-the-boxes-third-annual-bighorn-gravel-returns-with-reversed-course-more-riders-and-same-vibes/)

**Jake Wells [UNKNOWN - Race Co-Founder]:** "I think this year, the pack could be a little bigger going into the singletrack — the downhill into Abrams Gulch and over to Love Connector. I fully see it playing out on Cottonwood Pass. Whatever you got left is going to be emptied out." Discussing race strategy for the clockwise course direction. (https://www.vaildaily.com/news/checking-all-the-boxes-third-annual-bighorn-gravel-returns-with-reversed-course-more-riders-and-same-vibes/)

**Mike Brumbaugh [UNKNOWN - Race Co-Founder]:** "The last two years, I didn't weep, but I got choked up on more than one occasion. Watching people essentially empty themselves to go out and do this event you've encouraged and supported them to do — and see them complete it — there's no other way to experience that reward." (https://www.vaildaily.com/news/checking-all-the-boxes-third-annual-bighorn-gravel-returns-with-reversed-course-more-riders-and-same-vibes/)

**Tyler Pearce (The Vegan Cyclist) [ELITE/COMPETITIVE]:** "World class course, and world class community. Add Bighorn to your 2024 calendar!" He completed both the 85-mile and 50-mile courses in a double header. (https://www.thecoyotecollective.com/bighorn-gravel)

**randy_chainsaw_ [UNKNOWN]:** "Never done a bike race in my life so I decided to sign up for the Rams horn route (85 mile, 10K climbing). Have to choose between my diverge 2x with future shock 2.0 or my new crux with mullet setup (10-51 12 speed). Currently 42 pathfinders on both rigs, though may up to 45 or 47 for this route. The climbing and the amount of single track has me flip flopping (lighter crux with favorable gearing or plush/comfy diverge)." (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/1c9sz5x/bighorn_gravel_gypsum_co/)

**checkyour6 [UNKNOWN]:** "Never done a bike race in my life so I decided to sign up for the Little Bighorn Gravel race.

**Mike Brumbaugh [UNKNOWN - Race Co-Founder]:** "These guys have all ridden in France and seen the Dolomites, and I was like, 'trust me, this is an incredible ride.' We all rode road bikes and when we got done, every one of them was like, 'that is one of the best rides I've done in my life.' We saw an Osprey attack a bald eagle and steal a fish from him…I mean who gets to see that?!" Describing the Bighorn Road course. (https://www.vaildaily.com/news/bighorn-gravel-2025-off-road-mountain-bike-race-gypsum/)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**[UNKNOWN]:** Bike choice dilemma between Specialized Diverge 2x with Future Shock 2.0 (comfort-focused) vs. Specialized Crux with mullet setup 10-51 12-speed (lighter, better gearing). Rider considering 42mm Pathfinder tires, possibly upsizing to 45 or 47mm for the Ram's Horn route. (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/1c9sz5x/bighorn_gravel_gypsum_co/)

**Ben Delaney [ELITE/COMPETITIVE]:** Provided equipment-focused video content with 16K views. (https://www.thecoyotecollective.com/bighorn-gravel)

**General Course Guidance [FROM RACE ORGANIZERS]:** "If you're on a mountain bike, you'll be happy, if you're on a gravel bike, you'll be happy. But at some point in the race — no matter what you're on — you'll wish you were on a different bike." The course includes both smooth paved descents and rowdy singletrack, making perfect bike choice impossible. (https://www.vaildaily.com/news/checking-all-the-boxes-third-annual-bighorn-gravel-returns-with-reversed-course-more-riders-and-same-vibes/)

**Equipment Testing [ELITE]:** BMC URS tested with Campagnolo's 13-speed Ekar group at the inaugural Bighorn Gravel 85-mile course. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnqAdNTiLKE)

**MTB Option [ELITE/COMPETITIVE]:** Specialized Epic HT hardtail tested at Bighorn Gravel on a course with "nearly 10,000 feet of climbing at elevation and a few miles of singletrack." (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zx58wCVnGTI)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Singletrack Sections:** The course includes "rugged singletrack" with specific mentions of "the downhill into Abrams Gulch and over to Love Connector" and rowdy descents through rock gardens. A cable cam was set up at Aid 1 to capture "insane action video on the rowdy singletrack descent." (https://www.thecoyotecollective.com/bighorn-gravel, https://www.vaildaily.com/news/checking-all-the-boxes-third-annual-bighorn-gravel-returns-with-reversed-course-more-riders-and-same-vibes/)

**Hike-a-Bike Sections:** Multiple sources confirm "a hike a bike or two" are part of the course, particularly on the Ram's Horn Escape. (https://www.granfondoguide.com/Events/Index/10530/bighorn-gravel)

**Red Hill Climb:** In the counter-clockwise direction (2023), Red Hill was "the lung-busting Red Hill climb after the police escort." In 2024-2025 clockwise direction, riders descend Red Hill on pavement instead. (https://www.vaildaily.com/news/checking-all-the-boxes-third-annual-bighorn-gravel-returns-with-reversed-course-more-riders-and-same-vibes/)

**Spring Creek Trails:** When running clockwise, "the rugged Spring Creek Trails" come early after heading east on Cooley Mesa Road. Not as steep as Red Hill but "will still sort things out." (https://www.vaildaily.com/news/checking-all-the-boxes-third-annual-bighorn-gravel-returns-with-reversed-course-more-riders-and-same-vibes/)

**Brush Creek to Sylvan Lake:** Described as climbing in shade with wildflowers and moose sightings. The 4,000-foot ascent on Brush Creek Road "will test everyone's high-altitude legs." (https://www.vaildaily.com/news/bighorn-gravel-2025-off-road-mountain-bike-race-gypsum/)

**Gypsum Creek:** In clockwise direction, this becomes a "gradual Gypsum Creek ascent" which is "now a buttery smooth downhill" with pristine gravel. Depending on wind, it could be where breakaway riders get caught. (https://www.vaildaily.com/news/bighorn-gravel-2025-off-road-mountain-bike-race-gypsum/, https://www.vaildaily.com/news/checking-all-the-boxes-third-annual-bighorn-gravel-returns-with-reversed-course-more-riders-and-same-vibes/)

**Cottonwood Pass:** The "final climb after the fourth aid station at mile 68" in the clockwise direction. Jake Wells: "I fully see it playing out on Cottonwood Pass. Whatever you got left is going to be emptied out." (https://www.vaildaily.com/news/checking-all-the-boxes-third-annual-bighorn-gravel-returns-with-reversed-course-more-riders-and-same-vibes/)

**High Point:** Course reaches approximately 11,000 feet near Peter Estin Hut. Aid station moved "a little past Yeoman Park Campground, closer to the course's 11,000-foot high point" in 2025. (https://www.vaildaily.com/news/bighorn-gravel-2025-off-road-mountain-bike-race-gypsum/)

**Surface Mix:** Course blends "long gravel climbs with nasty, twisting singletrack descents" and covers "environments from 11,000-ft. high alpine forest to sandy, scrubby rolling hills with forest service doubletrack and red earth." Also includes "smooth paved descents." (https://www.thecoyotecollective.com/bighorn-gravel, https://www.vaildaily.com/news/checking-all-the-boxes-third-annual-bighorn-gravel-returns-with-reversed-course-more-riders-and-same-vibes/)

**Love Connector Trail:** Mentioned as part of the early singletrack experience when fresh. (https://www.vaildaily.com/news/bighorn-gravel-2025-off-road-mountain-bike-race-gypsum/)

**Powerline Road Section:** Identified as a potential place where contenders might make moves depending on wind direction. (https://www.vaildaily.com/news/checking-all-the-boxes-third-annual-bighorn-gravel-returns-with-reversed-course-more-riders-and-same-vibes/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Course Direction Impact [FROM RACE ORGANIZERS]:** The switch to clockwise direction puts technical singletrack early "when people are fresh and feeling good" rather than late in the race. This could keep the pack together longer going into the downhill singletrack sections. (https://www.vaildaily.com/news/bighorn-gravel-2025-off-road-mountain-bike-race-gypsum/)

**Early Race Positioning [ELITE OBSERVATION]:** "Getting some of the Spring Creek and Love Connector (trails) in there early when people are fresh and feeling good is important." The singletrack comes early in clockwise direction, potentially keeping larger groups together longer. (https://www.vaildaily.com/news/bighorn-gravel-2025-off-road-mountain-bike-race-gypsum/)

**Mid-Race Selection [RACE ORGANIZER PREDICTION]:** Jake Wells predicts the 4,000-foot Brush Creek Road ascent will test high-altitude legs, and the downhill to Sylvan Lake and Powerline Road section is where contenders might attack. (https://www.vaildaily.com/news/checking-all-the-boxes-third-annual-bighorn-gravel-returns-with-reversed-course-more-riders-and-same-vibes/)

**Final Selection Point [RACE ORGANIZER PREDICTION]:** "I fully see it playing out on Cottonwood Pass. Whatever you got left is going to be emptied out." The final climb at mile 68 predicted to be decisive. (https://www.vaildaily.com/news/checking-all-the-boxes-third-annual-bighorn-gravel-returns-with-reversed-course-more-riders-and-same-vibes/)

**2024 Winning Strategy [ELITE]:** Howard Grotts came in solo after shaking off contenders, having "skipped the final aid station" according to women's winner Michaela Thompson who employed the same tactic, passing Olympian Erin Huck. (https://www.thecoyotecollective.com/bighorn-gravel)

**Timing as Training Race:** "It's the first opportunity to get some high-altitude racing in. So I think it lines up well for those riders" training for Crusher in the Tushar, Leadville 100, or Steamboat Gravel. Positioned as perfect June tuneup race. (https://www.vaildaily.com/news/bighorn-gravel-2025-off-road-mountain-bike-race-gypsum/)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Time Cutoffs Enforced:**
- 11 a.m.: Yeoman Park Campground Aid Station (mile 28) - all Ram's Horn Escape riders must leave by this time
- 1 p.m.: Sylvan Lake Aid Station - all riders must leave by this time  
- 3:30 p.m.: Cottonwood Aid Station (mile 69) - all Ram's Horn riders must leave by this time
- 5:30 p.m.: Official Finisher Cut Off
(https://www.vaildaily.com/news/checking-all-the-boxes-third-annual-bighorn-gravel-returns-with-reversed-course-more-riders-and-same-vibes/)

**Weather Risk:** In 2023, organizers were "forced to make a last-second course change as 6 feet of snow covered the course at its high point (roughly 11,000 feet)." (https://www.vaildaily.com/news/checking-all-the-boxes-third-annual-bighorn-gravel-returns-with-reversed-course-more-riders-and-same-vibes/)

**Technical Challenges:** "Most riders made it through the rock gardens unscathed" implies some did not. The hike-a-bike sections and rowdy singletrack descents present mechanical and handling risks. (https://www.thecoyotecollective.com/bighorn-gravel)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Local Discovery:** "It's longtime locals who'd been here and never done these rides. Just to open their eyes to what we have going on over here that is really accessible to them without driving through the canyon." 30-40 attendees at free recon rides discovering local terrain. (https://www.vaildaily.com/news/checking-all-the-boxes-third-annual-bighorn-gravel-returns-with-reversed-course-more-riders-and-same-vibes/)

**Community Support:** "The support we have from the community and the government is just — Jake and I look at each other and say, 'what did we do to deserve this?' — because it's pretty amazing. The stoke level of everyone involved, from the volunteers and vendors to the police escorts and the Town of Gypsum is Brumbaugh's favorite part." (https://www.vaildaily.com/news/bighorn-gravel-2025-off-road-mountain-bike-race-gypsum/)

**Town Enthusiasm:** "They love the biking community. They love the event and what the spirit of gravel is all about. That's so cool to see this day and age from a town." (https://www.vaildaily.com/news/bighorn-gravel-2025-off-road-mountain-bike-race-gypsum/)

**Festival Atmosphere:** Saturday expo includes "live music, food trucks, beer, kids balance bike race at 11:30 a.m., sponsored shakeout rides, and a Q&A with pros." Craftsman Beer Garden open race day. (https://www.vaildaily.com/news/checking-all-the-boxes-third-annual-bighorn-gravel-returns-with-reversed-course-more-riders-and-same-vibes/, https://www.vaildaily.com/news/bighorn-gravel-2025-off-road-mountain-bike-race-gypsum/)

**Raffle and Prizes:** "Every 'official starter' will be entered into a raffle for a chance to win some really cool items" including wheels and GPS computers. (https://www.thecoyotecollective.com/bighorn-gravel, https://www.granfondoguide.com/Events/Index/10530/bighorn-gravel)

**The Ibex Award:** "$1,000 for the final athlete who crosses the finish line" funded by an anonymous donor for the third straight year. (https://www.vaildaily.com/news/checking-all-the-boxes-third-annual-bighorn-gravel-returns-with-reversed-course-more-riders-and-same-vibes/)

**Emotional Finish:** "Watching people essentially empty themselves to go out and do this event you've encouraged and supported them to do — and see them complete it — there's no other way to experience that reward." Race founders describe getting choked up watching finishers. (https://www.vaildaily.com/news/checking-all-the-boxes-third-annual-bighorn-gravel-returns-with-reversed-course-more-riders-and-same-vibes/)

**Sustainability Focus:** "We're totally content with holding steady with about 500-600 riders. You see people that aren't on your page with cycling and you want to hear the same positive feedback from them that you're getting from the cycling community." Intentionally limiting growth to preserve community relations. (https://www.vaildaily.com/news/checking-all-the-boxes-third-annual-bighorn-gravel-returns-with-reversed-course-more-riders-and-same-vibes/)

**Contrast to Larger Events:** Organizers observed "friction brought about by weekly influxes of endurance athletes descending upon small mountain towns like Leadville or Steamboat Springs" and want to avoid that. (https://www.vaildaily.com/news/checking-all-the-boxes-third-annual-bighorn-gravel-returns-with-reversed-course-more-riders-and-same-vibes/)

**On-Site Camping:** "Thanks to their support, we are able to offer onsite camping, complete with showers and bathrooms." Rec Center open for showers and day passes until 7 p.m. Saturday, 5 p.m. Sunday. (https://www.granfondoguide.com/Events/Index/10530/bighorn-gravel, https://www.vaildaily.com/news/checking-all-the-boxes-third-annual-bighorn-gravel-returns-with-reversed-course-more-riders-and-same-vibes/)

**Police Escort Start:** "2 mile Neutral rollout by Eagle County Sheriff" for both Ram's Horn Escape (7 a.m.) and Little Bighorn (8 a.m.) starts. (https://www.vaildaily.com/news/checking-all-the-boxes-third-annual-bighorn-gravel-returns-with-reversed-course-more-riders-and-same-vibes/)

**Three-Box Success:** "We set out in the beginning to create an amazing experience for the riders. Unlike gravel events which either prioritize professionals and prize purses, post-race parties or challenging course, Bighorn Gravel's co-founders feel they've carved out their niche as a grassroots event that does it all. I think somehow, just by the grace of God, we kind of tick all three boxes." (https://www.vaildaily.com/news/checking-all-the-boxes-third-annual-bighorn-gravel-returns-with-reversed-course-more-riders-and-same-vibes/)

## Pricing Feedback

**Price Concerns [UNKNOWN]:** "Looking at races like CO2UT ($298!) and Bighorn Gravel ($212) with insane price tags turns me off. I get shelling out for marquee races like Leadville, Unbound, etc. as bucket-list races with massive support and making a weekend out of them and expecting them to be the highlight of the season, but this seems crazy for rides that are B or C tier on most racer's schedules. Are people actually paying this to ride B and C tier gravel races?" (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/1jk34r0/what_the_hell_happened_to_the_price_of_gravel/)

**2025 Official Pricing:** $91.11-$264.98 (Bighorn Gravel), $122.90-$211.94 (Bighorn Road). Series passes available at 10% discount. (https://www.movemint.cc/series/bighorn_series_2025)
