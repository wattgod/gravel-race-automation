# BOHEMIAN BORDER BASH — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Justina [ELITE]:** "1400 km, 25 thousand meters of elevation gain, singletrack riding, enduro trail descents, numerous hike & bike rides, hour-long walks with pushing the bike, constant confusion about which country you are currently in (4 to choose from), night river crossings and pure, wild adventure that seems to have no end - and all this on a gravel bike." (https://magazinebike.com/2024/10/01/bohemian-border-bash-race-in-search-of-borders/)

**Justina [ELITE]:** "My assumptions were simple and said to treat this race as a bikepacking holiday with an additional attraction, which was to be sleeping in the wild... after 22 p.m. I set off towards the start... 12 hours before the start I was congratulating the newlyweds and doing carbo loading wedding cake and chicken with potatoes." (https://magazinebike.com/2024/10/01/bohemian-border-bash-race-in-search-of-borders/)

**Bettina Bögl [ELITE]:** Completed the 2024 race in 162 hours as first woman. (https://rawcyclingmag.com/border-bash-bohemia-camp-2024-recap/)

**Rasmus Bozyk [ELITE]:** Won the 2024 race in 126 hours. (https://rawcyclingmag.com/border-bash-bohemia-camp-2024-recap/)

**Buzzalong rider [UNKNOWN]:** "As I stood at the starting line, a mixture of excitement and anxiety coursed through my veins. This was my first Solo off-road race, and I was far from a mechanical expert or an experienced gravel rider." Finished as first woman in 2023 in 124 hours 58 minutes. (https://www.buzzalong.cc/post/bohemian-border-bash-1300km-insights-from-my-first-solo-off-road-ultra-endurance-cycling-race)

**Buzzalong rider [UNKNOWN]:** "The Ghost checkpoint to checkpoint 2 stretch was a demanding ride through dense forests. I reached checkpoint 2 in the dead of night, where a hike-a-bike section awaited. Alone in the forest, fear gripped me. It was my first time navigating such terrain solo." (https://www.buzzalong.cc/post/bohemian-border-bash-1300km-insights-from-my-first-solo-off-road-ultra-endurance-cycling-race)

**RAW Magazine editor [UNKNOWN]:** "Throughout the three days, we rode on the Ghost Asket Pro. The bike was comfortable and easy to handle on the terrain, providing plenty of stability with its 50 mm tires, which were more than sufficient for the mostly smooth gravel." (https://rawcyclingmag.com/border-bash-bohemia-camp-2024-recap/)

**Josh Ibbett [COMPETITIVE]:** Rode "the medium distance" (124km The Bash route) with a broken derailleur, "forcing him to complete the whole route on a fixed gear." (https://rawcyclingmag.com/border-bash-bohemia-camp-2024-recap/)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Gravel bike setup [UNKNOWN level]:** Fara F/Gravel bike with Shimano GRX 1X, 11-42t gearing, Pirelli Cinturato Gravel M 45mm tubeless tires with Silca sealant. Redshift Shockstop PRO suspension seatpost and stem. Total bike weight: 16kg loaded. Used Restrap Hike-a-bike strap and QUOC Gran Tourer II gravel shoes. Added Aerobars Controltech Sirocco for hand position variation. (https://www.buzzalong.cc/post/bohemian-border-bash-1300km-insights-from-my-first-solo-off-road-ultra-endurance-cycling-race)

**Tire width [UNKNOWN level]:** "50 mm tires, which were more than sufficient for the mostly smooth gravel" on the Ghost Asket Pro during camp rides. (https://rawcyclingmag.com/border-bash-bohemia-camp-2024-recap/)

**Gravel vs MTB choice [UNKNOWN level]:** "In the case of the Bohemian Border Bash Ultra, a gravel bike was a suitable choice due to the mix of surfaces and long-distance riding. The lightweight setup, comfortable components, and adaptability to both on-road and off-road sections made it a great fit for the race. However, for races with more technical and rugged terrain, a mountain bike with robust suspension and knobby tires might be a better option." (https://www.buzzalong.cc/post/bohemian-border-bash-1300km-insights-from-my-first-solo-off-road-ultra-endurance-cycling-race)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Course structure described as symphony:** The official 2026 description frames the 1,420km with 25,290m climbing as six movements:
- I. Allegro Moderato: 366km / 6,710m - "Light, flowing, deceptive... Small rises interrupt the flow"
- II. Crescendo delle Colline: 413km / 7,040m - "Hills arrive one after another... fatigue quietly enters the race"
- III. Intermezzo: 233km / 3,050m - "The course eases... Use this section wisely—it is preparation disguised as relief"
- IV. Modulation to Minor: 142km / 2,084m - "The course turns back toward the mountains... This is where the race becomes personal"
- V. Fortissimo - Inferno del Nord: 209km / 4,720m - "The brutal climax. Steep, unrelenting climbs... Traction is scarce, progress is slow"
- VI. The Final Refrain: 52km / 1,000m - "A decisive hike-a-bike. Each step stretches time" (https://www.borderbash.cc/)

**Checkpoint 2 area:** "Upper Palatine Forest: Political turmoil has reshaped this region... Most of this area was vacated after the forced expulsion of its predominantly German inhabitants after World War II. Then, until the fall of the Communist regime in 1989, it was part of the Western Border Zone of then Czechoslovakia, virtually uninhabited... only minimally affected by human activities - remaining a mosaic of quiet deep forests, meadows, and forests." (https://www.buzzalong.cc/post/bohemian-border-bash-1300km-insights-from-my-first-solo-off-road-ultra-endurance-cycling-race)

**Checkpoint 10:** "A collapsed bridge presented a new challenge. With determination and a hiker bike strap, I crossed the broken bridge." (https://www.buzzalong.cc/post/bohemian-border-bash-1300km-insights-from-my-first-solo-off-road-ultra-endurance-cycling-race)

**Friday Camp route:** "Straight into the first few short but steep climbs, which required some hike-a-bike for some. Along the 73 km route, there were several stops to complete small games and challenges... The route was highly enjoyable, primarily following gravel roads, and where we did use the road, we completely avoided traffic." (https://rawcyclingmag.com/border-bash-bohemia-camp-2024-recap/)

**Saturday Camp routes:** "The final 40 km, entirely on gravel, with several rolling hills that tested our endurance as fatigue set in." (https://rawcyclingmag.com/border-bash-bohemia-camp-2024-recap/)

**Between CP1 & 2:** "Just before CP2 there was an intermediate CP where you could sleep and resupply food. I arrived there in the middle of the night." (https://www.buzzalong.cc/post/bohemian-border-bash-1300km-insights-from-my-first-solo-off-road-ultra-endurance-cycling-race)

**Day 3 Bohemian Forest:** "More hiking than biking, a true test of my endurance." (https://www.buzzalong.cc/post/bohemian-border-bash-1300km-insights-from-my-first-solo-off-road-ultra-endurance-cycling-race)

(https://www.buzzalong.cc/post/bohemian-border-bash-1300km-insights-from-my-first-solo-off-road-ultra-endurance-cycling-race)

**Key strategic advice from course designer:** "Ride it with patience, respect the tempo, and remember—every movement matters... Overconfidence here will echo later" (Movement I). "Manage effort and fuel early—the crescendo does not peak here" (Movement II). "Recover with purpose—don't drift" (Movement III). "Stay focused—small decisions now have big consequences" (Movement IV). "Keep moving—however slowly" (Movement V). (https://www.borderbash.cc/)

**Resupply opportunities:** "One of the wonders of ultra cycling is the unexpected discoveries along the way. I stumbled upon a hidden gem during my journey, a UNESCO heritage site, Cesky Krumlov, a medieval city steeped in history... allowed me to make a quick stop in a bike shop to fix my derailleur hanger and resupply on sports nutrition." (https://www.buzzalong.cc/post/bohemian-border-bash-1300km-insights-from-my-first-solo-off-road-ultra-endurance-cycling-race)

**CP6 decision point:** "CP6 was the last chance to scratch from the race." (https://www.buzzalong.cc/post/bohemian-border-bash-1300km-insights-from-my-first-solo-off-road-ultra-endurance-cycling-race)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Overall DNF rate:** "When my close friend told me about it for the first time a year ago... about the number of DNFs that was easily over 50%, I tapped myself on the forehead." (https://magazinebike.com/2024/10/01/bohemian-border-bash-race-in-search-of-borders/)

**Night navigation challenges:** "Alone in the forest, fear gripped me. It was my first time navigating such terrain solo" during the hike-a-bike section approaching CP2 in the dark. (https://www.buzzalong.cc/post/bohemian-border-bash-1300km-insights-from-my-first-solo-off-road-ultra-endurance-cycling-race)

**Technical terrain:** "Singletrack riding, enduro trail descents, numerous hike & bike rides, hour-long walks with pushing the bike" create multiple challenge points. (https://magazinebike.com/2024/10/01/bohemian-border-bash-race-in-search-of-borders/)

**Mechanical issues on remote terrain:** One rider "far from a mechanical expert" completed successfully, but the remote forest sections with limited access create mechanical vulnerability. (https://www.buzzalong.cc/post/bohemian-border-bash-1300km-insights-from-my-first-solo-off-road-ultra-endurance-cycling-race)

**Oliver Lotze story:** "Despite pulling out of his first attempt, improved gradually each year and has now successfully crossed the finish line of the Bohemian Border Bash Race for the second time" - illustrating that DNFs are common even among returning riders. (https://rawcyclingmag.com/border-bash-bohemia-camp-2024-recap/)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Camp atmosphere:** "It's not about the facilities but about the people you share these adventures with. It quickly became clear that Border Bash is an event with a genuinely inclusive, friendly, and laid-back atmosphere where newcomers feel welcome and can easily blend in with more experienced participants." (https://rawcyclingmag.com/border-bash-bohemia-camp-2024-recap/)

**International community:** "Most of the participants came to the camp from Germany, but we also met several people from the UK, Czechia, Netherlands or Poland. The atmosphere was once again very international, naturally inviting to share cycling stories, such as those of bikepacking across different countries, completing ultra distance races, or some sharing their mutual enthusiasm for frame building." (https://rawcyclingmag.com/border-bash-bohemia-camp-2024-recap/)

**Camp activities:** "Neza Peterca from What Happened Outdoors hosted an insightful workshop on outdoor clothing repair and maintenance, sharing tips valuable for everyone planning a bikepacking trip or an ultra-distance race. Impressively, Neza came to the Border Bash Camp directly from Kyrgyzstan after participating in the Silk Road Mountain Race." (https://rawcyclingmag.com/border-bash-bohemia-camp-2024-recap/)

**Race finish celebration:** "Many of us were dot-watching the participants of the Bohemian Border Bash Race, who were arriving at the finish in camp one by one in the late evening hours, cheered on by the campers... Saturday night included the Bohemian Border Bash Race winners' ceremony, and a storytelling of participants' testimonials." (https://rawcyclingmag.com/border-bash-bohemia-camp-2024-recap/)

**Evening activities:** "DJ Feinkosttwang spun vinyl records to set a party atmosphere for those who still had energy, while the more tired participants could enjoy a cozy campfire." "Saturday night wrapped up with a big bonfire." (https://rawcyclingmag.com/border-bash-bohemia-camp-2024-recap/)

**Camp vs Race motto:** "The event's motto of breaking borders while riding, this commitment also holds true on a social level, as the camp brings together people from many countries to forge new friendships. Engaging in conversations while sharing a ride, exchanging stories of past adventures, or enjoying the evening by the warmth of a campfire... It's not a race, it's not about performance—it's about leaving with a great experience." (https://rawcyclingmag.com/border-bash-bohemia-2024-international-gravel-event-you-should-visit/)

**2025 DIY format evolution:** "This year's edition invites riders to shape their own experience... This year's Do-It-Yourself format provides riders with access to curated GPX routes—from the scenic 'Little Bash' to the epic full-day rides—but the choice of when and how to ride these routes is entirely up to you... This isn't a spectator event—it's a participatory experience where everyone contributes to the atmosphere and energy." (https://www.borderbash.cc/gravelcampbohemia2025)
