# BOOTLEGGER 100 — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Kimberly (Endo) [ELITE]:** "I went out too fast. No shock there. I ended up in the front, and hoped I did not take a wrong turn as I never ran this trail before. It felt exhilarating running faster on the trail, but as usual, mother nature knows how to humble you. I caught my foot on something around mile 2-3 and went flying. Full on baseball slide down the right side of my upper body." (https://endokimberly.wixsite.com/risingruncoaching/post/race-report-bootlegger-bananza)

**Kimberly [ELITE]:** "Beautiful trail in the light. Creepy in the dark. I turned right to head back to the start/finish, and almost turned back around because a runner was going out on their second half of a loop making the track we were on a two way." (https://endokimberly.wixsite.com/risingruncoaching/post/race-report-bootlegger-bananza)

**Jason Lopez [COMPETITIVE]:** "Epic! The best way to describe the whole experience is Epic. From the views, the course, and the Pisgah Productions hosting. Though, there was quite a bit of suffering, some sketchy descents and corners, and some tough competition, it was an amazing day. This was my first time climbing over 10000 ft in one ride. It was a bit brutal. I should have chosen different gearing, but sometimes it is best to ride what you have." (https://jaylocycling.com/2023-bootlegger-100-gravel-race-report/)

**Jason Lopez [COMPETITIVE]:** "I would get passed by quite a few riders on the climbs, but once we hit the descent, I would bomb passed many of the riders. Quite a few of the descent were technical and since it had rained the night before they were slick in a lot of places." (https://jaylocycling.com/2023-bootlegger-100-gravel-race-report/)

**Jason Lopez [COMPETITIVE]:** "It was a long journey of almost 107 miles and 10604 ft of elevation gain. Total moving time was 8 hrs and 18 mins. The day started out a bit rainy and chilly but warmed up to a nice 58 F." (https://jaylocycling.com/2023-bootlegger-100-gravel-race-report/)

**Jay P. [COMPETITIVE/UNKNOWN]:** "My main takeaways, based on seven or eight serious gravel events, Battenkill, a few of the major fondos including Levi's and Hincapie and nearly 100 USAC races was 1) that the race was unusually well organized. 2) It is one of the most challenging '100' length gravel races in the country and maybe THE most challenging." (https://runthequay.itsyourrace.com/event.aspx?id=16622)

**Larry B. [UNKNOWN]:** "The ride/race itself you couldn't ask for a better organized ride. All the turns were marked either with an arrow and or orange flagging tapping hanging from the trees before the turns and on stakes or hanging from the trees after the turn to assure you that you were still on course. They had 3 controls/rest stops on the 60 miler. The guy at the 41.7 one was way over the top cooking up grilled cheese sandwiches which for sure hit the spot." (https://runthequay.itsyourrace.com/event.aspx?id=16622)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Gearing [COMPETITIVE]:** Jason Lopez noted: "I should have chosen different gearing" for the 10,000+ ft climbing course, suggesting easier gearing is needed for the sustained climbs. (https://jaylocycling.com/2023-bootlegger-100-gravel-race-report/)

**Lights [ALL LEVELS - REQUIRED]:** Race rules require racers to "burn FRONT and REAR lights at all times while on the bike." Multiple sources confirm early morning starts in darkness. (https://bootlegger100.com/, https://runthequay.itsyourrace.com/event.aspx?id=16622)

**Tires [UNKNOWN LEVEL]:** One rider on Reddit specifically requested tire advice for the Bootlegger 100, noting "I understand rain or shine probably changes things up" - indicating conditions significantly affect tire choice. (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/1bbq2k6/western_nc_bootlegger_100_tire_advice/)

**Descent Handling [COMPETITIVE]:** Jason Lopez's experience: "Quite a few of the descent were technical and since it had rained the night before they were slick in a lot of places." Technical descending skills are crucial. (https://jaylocycling.com/2023-bootlegger-100-gravel-race-report/)

## Weather Experienced

**2023 Bootlegger 100:** "The day started out a bit rainy and chilly but warmed up to a nice 58 F." Rain the night before made descents slick. (https://jaylocycling.com/2023-bootlegger-100-gravel-race-report/)

**2024 Bootlegger 100 (Georgia Trail Run version):** "The unseasonable heat approached 90 degrees in central Georgia" on April 5. Heat was significant enough that "A lot of runners did drop down and DNF by mid afternoon." (https://tennesseevalleyoutsider.com/tvo-roundup-bootlegger-100-savage-gulf-50k-and-new-notes/)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Course Profile:** Multiple sources confirm approximately 10,000 feet of climbing. The 107-mile route has "9700 feet of climbing" while the 58-mile route has "approximately 4500 feet of climbing." (https://www.granfondoguide.com/Events/Index/5352/the-bootlegger-100-proof-dirt-road-ride, https://www.pisgahproductions.com/events/bootlegger-100/)

**Surface Composition:** "There is roughly 1.5 of paved roads, 1 mile of gravel roads, and the rest is spectacular single track trail on each loop" for the trail running version. (https://bootlegger100.com/)

**Gravel version composition:** "Just after you pass Coffey's General Store and Museum, the two routes split, and the long course heads all the way up to the highest point of the day on the Blue Ridge Parkway. Be prepared for gravity to do as much work for you as your braking fingers will let it as you descend fourteen miles down the Parkway and also Pineola Road before rejoining with the shorter course." (https://www.pisgahproductions.com/events/bootlegger-100/)

**Wilson Creek Section:** "Everyone will enjoy a brief respite as the road parallels the burbling Wilson Creek for eight miles before the final gravel challenge on the infamous Maple Sally Road before heading back to town for the finish." (https://www.pisgahproductions.com/events/bootlegger-100/)

**Descent Characteristics [COMPETITIVE]:** Jason Lopez: "I would get passed by quite a few riders on the climbs, but once we hit the descent, I would bomb passed many of the riders. Quite a few of the descent were technical and since it had rained the night before they were slick in a lot of places." (https://jaylocycling.com/2023-bootlegger-100-gravel-race-report/)

**Course Marking:** Multiple sources confirm excellent marking: "All the turns were marked either with an arrow and or orange flagging tapping hanging from the trees before the turns and on stakes or hanging from the trees after the turn." Official marking: "Turns will be marked with ORANGE course marking tape. There will be three pieces of tape on the side of the road as the turn and one piece of confirmation tape after the turn. There will also be large ORANGE arrow signs." (https://runthequay.itsyourrace.com/event.aspx?id=16622)

**Finish Approach:** "There is a downhill to the finish in downtown Lenoir. Please be aware of pedestrians and spectators as you approach the finish line." (https://runthequay.itsyourrace.com/event.aspx?id=16622)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Early Pace Control [ELITE]:** Kimberly's experience: "I went out too fast. No shock there... I dialed it back and reminded myself, I just need to coast and not crush it because I had a job to do later. About half way through, I felt the effects of going out too fast and that I forgot to fuel a mile or so back, so popped a gel." (https://endokimberly.wixsite.com/risingruncoaching/post/race-report-bootlegger-bananza)

**Race Dynamics [COMPETITIVE]:** Jason Lopez: "Before even hitting the first section of gravel, the race was already starting to string out. I put in a few hard efforts and managed to close the gap and make it to the front group. Once we hit the first climbs the race blew up." (https://jaylocycling.com/2023-bootlegger-100-gravel-race-report/)

**Climb vs Descent Strategy [COMPETITIVE]:** Jason Lopez noted he would "get passed by quite a few riders on the climbs, but once we hit the descent, I would bomb passed many of the riders," suggesting technical descending skills can make up for climbing deficits at the competitive level. (https://jaylocycling.com/2023-bootlegger-100-gravel-race-report/)

**Cutoff Times:** "100 miles 32 hour OR choose the 35 hour early start option, 50 miles 20 hours, 12 miler 7 hours" for the trail running version. The gravel version has a "9:00PM Final cutoff." (https://bootlegger100.com/, https://runthequay.itsyourrace.com/event.aspx?id=16622)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Heat-Related DNFs:** At the 2024 Georgia trail running version, "A lot of runners did drop down and DNF by mid afternoon" when heat approached 90 degrees. "If they were not on top of electrolytes and hydration, it was about to catch up to them." (https://tennesseevalleyoutsider.com/tvo-roundup-bootlegger-100-savage-gulf-50k-and-new-notes/)

**High DNF Rate (Trail Run):** At the Georgia 100-mile trail race, "69 completed the course. Another 63 were DNF, as the unseasonable heat approached 90 degrees." That's a 47.7% DNF rate. (https://tennesseevalleyoutsider.com/tvo-roundup-bootlegger-100-savage-gulf-50k-and-new-notes/)

**Navigation Errors:** Kimberly's pacer Dani "accidentally missed a turn and tacked on five extra miles to her race. Five extra miles in a 100 mile race is not ideal." (https://endokimberly.wixsite.com/risingruncoaching/post/race-report-bootlegger-bananza)

**Technical Descents in Wet Conditions:** Multiple riders noted technical, slick descents after rain as challenging sections. (https://jaylocycling.com/2023-bootlegger-100-gravel-race-report/)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Race Organization:** Consistently praised across rider levels. Jay P.: "the race was unusually well organized" based on comparison to major events including Battenkill and Levi's GranFondo. (https://runthequay.itsyourrace.com/event.aspx?id=16622)

**Aid Stations:** "The guy at the 41.7 [mile rest stop] was way over the top cooking up grilled cheese sandwiches which for sure hit the spot. The burritos and beer at the finish line were great also." (https://runthequay.itsyourrace.com/event.aspx?id=16622)

**Pisgah Productions Hosting:** Jason Lopez: "Epic! The best way to describe the whole experience is Epic. From the views, the course, and the Pisgah Productions hosting." (https://jaylocycling.com/2023-bootlegger-100-gravel-race-report/)

**Revolution Running (Trail Version):** Kimberly: "The RDs and aid station volunteers were amazing at helping the runners that came in, and they were friendly. One of them came over to us and said we could pace Dani early if it looked like she needed a morale boost... Overall, I really loved running and hanging out with the Revolution Running crew. I even dare say, I'd try their track endurance run." (https://endokimberly.wixsite.com/risingruncoaching/post/race-report-bootlegger-bananza)

**Post-Race:** "Revolution Running had a menu for the runners that changed after a few hours each. They even offered us spectators some after each time window changed the menu." (https://endokimberly.wixsite.com/risingruncoaching/post/race-report-bootlegger-bananza)

**Local Atmosphere:** The race starts in downtown Lenoir, NC. "The City of Lenoir ENCOURAGES overnight Car/Van/RV camping in the downtown area! Just park in one of the many designated parking lots downtown!" (https://runthequay.itsyourrace.com/event.aspx?id=16622)

**Police Escort:** "A City of Lenoir police officer will lead a neutral pace start" with "City of Lenoir Police and Caldwell County Sheriffs will be providing traffic control at key intersections." (https://runthequay.itsyourrace.com/event.aspx?id=16622)
