# BORDER WARS — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Event Name Change (Important Update)

**From Race Promoter Wayne Whiteside:** "Originally, the name 'Border Wars Gravel Adventure' came from the light-hearted feud between the border folk of Georgia and Alabama. We listened to years of claims that the trees lean more toward one state or the other. Our event, of course, is all 'border' and no 'war'—other than the battle between us and the gnar. But we liked the hyperbole of the name. However, global tensions have continued around the world, humanity simply refuses to play nice. We've come to understand that sailing under our 'Border Wars' flag could cause our participants some internal conflict, which was neither our intent nor a consequence we were willing to accept. So we changed it. Done." 

**Effective 2025, the race is now called Homegrown Gravel Adventure.** (https://jaylocycling.com/2024-border-wars-gravel-race-report/)

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Jason Lopez [COMPETITIVE]:** "The 2024 Border Wars Gravel Race was quite a success I'd say. For the third annual event, it featured a new course, a new venue location, and longer route. This event is a hidden gem for gravel racing and has a huge potential to become a premier event." (https://jaylocycling.com/2024-border-wars-gravel-race-report/)

**Jason Lopez [COMPETITIVE]:** "NEVER TRUST THE NEUTRAL START! I have done quite a few gravel races with neutral starts, and I have yet to start a race out neutrally. Unless there is a lead vehicle keeping riders from passing and controlling the initial race speed, never trust a neutral start! Unfortunately, I fell for it again." (https://jaylocycling.com/2024-border-wars-gravel-race-report/)

**Jason Lopez [COMPETITIVE]:** "The race started out in downtown Franklin, GA and we rolled out of the little town with a few intersections being controlled by the local police. About a mile into the race, we hit the first off-road sector that was essentially a single-track path with a muddy section at the end. The 2024 Border Wars Gravel race instantly backed up as riders got off their bikes and were going single file to walk around the deepest section of the mud. I got caught behind quite a few people, then decided to ride through the last portion of it. But it was too late, the neutral roll out was blown up and the first group to pass through the mud was already up the road." (https://jaylocycling.com/2024-border-wars-gravel-race-report/)

**Jason Lopez [COMPETITIVE]:** "I am quite pleased with my race performance in the 2024 Border Wars Gravel, I finished 11th in my category, even with 7500 ft of climbing. My average speed was 16.2 mph, 245W normalized power, and a moving time of 5:58." (https://jaylocycling.com/2024-border-wars-gravel-race-report/)

**Jason Lopez [COMPETITIVE] on descending:** "As I've stated in other race reports, I'm not very fast up the climbs, but I'm a lot better at descending. Of the multiple downhill Strava segments, I had two top 10s, with many of the gnarly technical gravel descents not having segments created for them." (https://jaylocycling.com/2024-border-wars-gravel-race-report/)

**Carolyn Misick [ELITE]:** "I unexpectedly needed to help a friend in Atlanta and googled to see if any gravel events were going on in the area. The Gravel Gods were on my side as Border Wars Gravel Adventure (BWGA) was taking place on Saturday, February 24, 2024." (https://www.ohiogravelgrinders.com/blog/2024/2/27/border-wars-gravel)

**Carolyn Misick [ELITE]:** "Their website and FAQ page was one of the most helpful ones I have seen for what to expect on the ride. It noted stream crossing, updated mud encounters, places with steep downhills to narrow wood bridges, etc. The descriptions were very helpful and complete for all three routes." (https://www.ohiogravelgrinders.com/blog/2024/2/27/border-wars-gravel)

**Carolyn Misick [ELITE]:** "The gravel varied from packed dirt, to typically what one thinks of gravel roads and then there were what I describe as rock gardens. Rock gardens were on several steep climbs and on a few descents. Most of this section was in Alabama as described in the rider guide/FAQ page. These sections reminded me of the northern route of Unbound Gravel and BWGA would be a great early season prep for Unbound." (https://www.ohiogravelgrinders.com/blog/2024/2/27/border-wars-gravel)

**Carolyn Misick [ELITE]:** "There were a few muddy patches on the route with only one, besides the previously stated one, where you had to get off the bike to walk across. Nothing like sinking your shoe into deep muddy water. On a positive note you soon came to a descent with a stream crossing at the bottom before an ascent to partially clean off your shoes." (https://www.ohiogravelgrinders.com/blog/2024/2/27/border-wars-gravel)

**Carolyn Misick [ELITE]:** "Overall a great scenic ride in two states. And it was fun to see my time greatly improve as we rode through Alabama which is on central standard time. I ended up with 60 miles and 4300 feet of elevation." (https://www.ohiogravelgrinders.com/blog/2024/2/27/border-wars-gravel)

**Race Promoter Wayne Whiteside [UNKNOWN]:** "Quite possibly the best route I have ever created." (https://jaylocycling.com/2024-border-wars-gravel-race-report/)

## Course Details & Terrain

**Route Options (2024):**
- 100-mile – 70% gravel – 8000 ft elevation gain (originally planned; shortened due to bridge washout)
- 62-mile – 65% gravel – 5000 ft elevation gain (originally planned; shortened to ~60 miles)

**Terrain Specifics:**

The course is described as "half in Georgia and half in Alabama" with the gravel being "vastly different between the two" states. For the 60-mile route, 21 miles were in Alabama and the rest in Georgia. (https://www.ohiogravelgrinders.com/blog/2024/2/27/border-wars-gravel)

**Surface Variety [from ELITE rider Carolyn Misick]:** "The gravel varied from packed dirt, to typically what one thinks of gravel roads and then there were what I describe as rock gardens. Rock gardens were on several steep climbs and on a few descents." (https://www.ohiogravelgrinders.com/blog/2024/2/27/border-wars-gravel)

**From COMPETITIVE rider Jason Lopez:** "There were all types of gravel too, small compact gravel that was quite fast, and gravel with random chunks that could cause a pinch flat if hit wrong." (https://jaylocycling.com/2024-border-wars-gravel-race-report/)

**Notable Features:**
- Creek crossings
- Sketchy bridge crossings
- Stream crossing that helped clean muddy shoes
- Steep downhills to narrow wood bridges
- A 23% grade section

- Mostly off-road traversing rural roads (https://jaylocycling.com/2024-border-wars-gravel-race-report/ and https://www.ohiogravelgrinders.com/blog/2024/2/27/border-wars-gravel)

**Official Description:** "BWGA is a home-grown gravel grinder that straddles the border of Alabama and Georgia, where the gravel is vastly different between the two, and the only war is the mental struggle going on in your head to keep your legs going forward and the physical battle of your bike withstanding the punishment of the roads you're riding." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/videos/2024-border-wars-gravel-franklin-georgia/)

## Weather Experienced

**2024 Event [from COMPETITIVE rider Jason Lopez]:** "The morning of the race started out a bit chilly at 38° F and was going to warm up to 60° F by mid-day. This made it a bit tough to dress for, but at least this year was rain free. There was a decent head wind coming out of the NNW that was going to make the AL section of the race a little more challenging." (https://jaylocycling.com/2024-border-wars-gravel-race-report/)

**2024 Event [from ELITE rider Carolyn Misick]:** "The day was projected to be sunny and temps in the 60s." / "The day was sunny and temps were 40s at the start and 60s later. Winds however, had 20-30 mph gusts with mostly headwind on the route." (https://www.ohiogravelgrinders.com/blog/2024/2/27/border-wars-gravel)

**General timing note [from COMPETITIVE rider Jason Lopez]:** "2024 Border Wars Gravel is an early season race, so it really benefits riders from the south with tame winters that tend to start training earlier or riders that peak early season." (https://jaylocycling.com/2024-border-wars-gravel-race-report/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**START POSITIONING IS CRITICAL [COMPETITIVE rider Jason Lopez]:** "Advice to future self, stick to the front at the beginning of the race. Ride a little bit harder up the hill to stay on the front group." The early single-track mud section creates a massive bottleneck that can separate you from the lead group permanently. (https://jaylocycling.com/2024-border-wars-gravel-race-report/)

**Pacing Data** [COMPETITIVE] **Jason Lopez - 100-mile:** Finished 11th in category with:
- 5:58 moving time
- 16.2 mph average speed
- 245W normalized power
- 7500 ft climbing
Note: This rider states "I'm not very fast up the climbs, but I'm a lot better at descending" (https://jaylocycling.com/2024-border-wars-gravel-race-report/)

**ELITE Rider Approach [Carolyn Misick - 62-mile]:** "I started near the back as wasn't planning to race the route but have a good steady endurance ride. I didn't realize the walk around the mud section was practically single file so most of the front half plus of the group was far ahead by the time I passed through this section. Still since I was riding solo my rest stops were brief and I was always near other riders for the majority of the ride." Kept "a steady endurance effort throughout the course" and ended with 60 miles and 4300 feet of elevation. (https://www.ohiogravelgrinders.com/blog/2024/2/27/border-wars-gravel)

**Water/Hydration [COMPETITIVE rider Jason Lopez]:** "I had two bottles on my bike and a frame bag with a bladder. I was out of water by the end of the race and could have used a little bit more water, but I managed." There were multiple aid stops available but this rider chose not to use them.

**Post-Race [COMPETITIVE rider Jason Lopez]:** "The post ride was well hosted. There were quite a few booths of vendors. There were prize giveaways, food, and beer.

There was a band." (https://jaylocycling.com/2024-border-wars-gravel-race-report/)

**Post-Race [ELITE rider Carolyn Misick]:** "Post ride there was burgers, hot dogs and chili, including vegetarian, plus plenty of beer for those who indulge.
