  - "I would have to say the 2024 Border Wars Gravel course was really good. While out there it seemed like there was a lot of paved sections, but on paper there was only about 30 miles total." (jaylocycling.com report)[1].
  - "It’s really tough to say which side is better, AL or GA." (jaylocycling.com)[1].
  - "Advice to future self, stick to the front at the beginning of the race. Ride a little bit harder up the hill to stay on the front group." (jaylocycling.com)[1].
  - "Home-grown gravel grinder that straddles the border... gravel is vastly different between the two." (Gravel Cyclist YouTube/ohiogravelgrinders.com)[2][3].
- **YouTube race coverage**: "2024 Border Wars Gravel: Franklin, Georgia" by Gravel Cyclist (10:05, covers rollout, mud, aid stations, Rock Mills)[2]; "Border Wars 2024 - Gravel Chaos" (features race, puncture, DNF, crash)[7].
- **How the race is perceived**: Fun home-grown event emphasizing gravel differences and friendly rivalry; "all 'border' and no 'war'"; respected for terrain punishment; steward emphasis (respect roads/locals/land)[1][2][5].
