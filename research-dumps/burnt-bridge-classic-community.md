# BURNT BRIDGE CLASSIC — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Chad Grice [ELITE]:** "I have done the Burnt Bridge Classic more than any other gravel race, and over the years, the long course has grown in both distance and elevation. What is now the medium course was the long course of only a few years ago." (https://bookofchad.ca/2025/05/19/burnt-bridge-classic-gravel-2025/)

**Chad Grice [ELITE]:** "When the neutral ended, we rolled along at a fast but not unreasonable pace; however, moments later, when we hit the bottom of the climb and my power numbers went well north of 400w, I knew that I needed to shut that down and ride at a pace I could sustain for the entire first climb." (https://bookofchad.ca/2025/05/19/burnt-bridge-classic-gravel-2025/)

**Chad Grice [ELITE]:** "The second lap starts with a 7 km climb, and about 1 km in, I came completely apart. I have never cracked so hard in my life; I did the longest climb of the race at an average of 190W at 10 kph. It was awful, and I just kept looking back to see how many people were going to pass me." (https://bookofchad.ca/2025/05/19/burnt-bridge-classic-gravel-2025/)

**Chad Grice [ELITE]:** "The final climb, I was even more cracked and only managed to find 166W for 5.2 kms at 10 kph. This is where I started getting caught; five riders had passed me up the climb, and I was just surviving to get to the end. However, the final descent was really technical and had some single track, which was apparently exactly what I needed to get back in the race. I caught 4 of the 5 riders that passed me." (https://bookofchad.ca/2025/05/19/burnt-bridge-classic-gravel-2025/)

**Chad Grice [ELITE] - Final Stats:** "Distance: 120.86 km, Time: 5:08:10, Avg Speed: 23.5 kph, Avg Power: 185 W, Normalized Power: 210 W, Elevation Gain: 2106 m, Place: 14th" (https://bookofchad.ca/2025/05/19/burnt-bridge-classic-gravel-2025/)

**Brenna Pauly [ELITE]:** "Five kilometres into the race we hit the first major climb and I decided to ride tempo up the climb. I ended up riding away from the group and kept the momentum over the climb... After 70 kilometres of solo riding, I crossed the finish line winning the women's race." (https://pacificcyclingcentre.ca/news/brenna-pauly-takes-the-win-at-burnt-bridge/)

**Chad Grice [ELITE] - on neutral start incident:** "The race started off neutral behind David Dallin, which was nice for my pal Dave to lead a race, even if it was on a motorcycle. It didn't last long though because he took the second corner a little too hot, slid in the gravel, and spun slightly, stalling the bike." (https://bookofchad.ca/2025/05/19/burnt-bridge-classic-gravel-2025/)

**Chad Grice [ELITE] - on group crash:** "I set up for the toughest corner on the descent, turned in, the bike leaned, and I made it to the apex when I heard skidding behind me. As I exited the corner, I peered back to watch the first guy sail straight off the corner into the trees, and everyone behind him slid one by one to the scene of the accident." (https://bookofchad.ca/2025/05/19/burnt-bridge-classic-gravel-2025/)

**Chad Grice [ELITE] - wildlife encounter:** "I started down the descent, and halfway down, a large black bear decided to join the road in front of me. Luckily, it was quicker than I was and managed to run down and off the road before I could get stopped." (https://bookofchad.ca/2025/05/19/burnt-bridge-classic-gravel-2025/)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Chad Grice [ELITE]:** Ran 2.1-inch tires with a 75mm dropper post for the technical Kapoor descent, stating "with my setup of 2.1-inch tires and a 75mm dropper post, I thought that I would probably want to lead down this portion." (https://bookofchad.ca/2025/05/19/burnt-bridge-classic-gravel-2025/)

**Note on mechanical:** Aidan in the lead group "was rendered single-speed by SRAM" during the race, indicating SRAM drivetrain reliability as a potential issue. [ELITE group] (https://bookofchad.ca/2025/05/19/burnt-bridge-classic-gravel-2025/)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Kapoor Main Descent:** Chad Grice [ELITE] describes it as technical enough that he wanted to lead: "I have done this descent probably a dozen times, and with my setup of 2.1-inch tires and a 75mm dropper post, I thought that I would probably want to lead down this portion." Features "the toughest corner on the descent" where the entire chase group except one rider crashed. (https://bookofchad.ca/2025/05/19/burnt-bridge-classic-gravel-2025/)

**Final Descent:** "The final descent was really technical and had some single track" - technical enough that Chad [ELITE] used it to make up positions after bonking on the climbs. (https://bookofchad.ca/2025/05/19/burnt-bridge-classic-gravel-2025/)

**Course Evolution:** The long course has grown significantly over the years. What was once the long course (now medium) was 78.6 km and 1191 m. The current long course adds an additional loop of 42.9 km and 960 m. [ELITE perspective] (https://bookofchad.ca/2025/05/19/burnt-bridge-classic-gravel-2025/)

**Terrain Variety:** Brenna Pauly [ELITE] noted "The course offered lots of variety of terrain and beautiful scenery" with "a steep loose climb and rocky decent" 15km from the finish, followed by "six kilometres of rail trail to finish." (https://pacificcyclingcentre.ca/news/brenna-pauly-takes-the-win-at-burnt-bridge/)

**Second Lap Profile:** Long course features "a 7 km climb" to start the second lap, followed by another "5.2 km" climb later. Final 10 km described as "flat time trial to the finish." [ELITE experience] (https://bookofchad.ca/2025/05/19/burnt-bridge-classic-gravel-2025/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Chad Grice [ELITE] - Start Strategy:** When lead riders pushed 400W+ on the first climb, he deliberately backed off: "my power numbers went well north of 400w, I knew that I needed to shut that down and ride at a pace I could sustain for the entire first climb. I found a few like-minded, or at least like-powered, individuals, and we formed a group." (https://bookofchad.ca/2025/05/19/burnt-bridge-classic-gravel-2025/)

**Chad Grice [ELITE] - Group Work:** Was "very vocal in the group, trying to keep it working together to not only help me go forward but especially to prevent the 60km solo ride I had last gravel race." The group "worked really well, and we kept the speed up for well over two and a half hours together." (https://bookofchad.ca/2025/05/19/burnt-bridge-classic-gravel-2025/)

**Brenna Pauly [ELITE] - Pacing Strategy:** "Five kilometres into the race we hit the first major climb and I decided to ride tempo up the climb. I ended up riding away from the group and kept the momentum over the climb... I set a steady pace, passing riders that started in the earlier categories." Solo'd for 70km to the win. (https://pacificcyclingcentre.ca/news/brenna-pauly-takes-the-win-at-burnt-bridge/)

**Elite Pacing Numbers:** Chad [ELITE] averaged 185W for 5:08 (120.86km), but his bonk on lap 2 showed severe power degradation - from 400W+ capability early to 190W/166W on the major climbs. Final 10km TT at 190W/32kph. (https://bookofchad.ca/2025/05/19/burnt-bridge-classic-gravel-2025/)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Bonking Risk [ELITE]:** Chad Grice experienced severe bonking on lap 2: "I came completely apart. I have never cracked so hard in my life" - dropped from 400W+ capability to 166-190W on climbs. He considered quitting: "I was thinking about quitting and turning back; at this point, I was so wrecked and hardly moving. I just kept eating and kept turning the pedals." (https://bookofchad.ca/2025/05/19/burnt-bridge-classic-gravel-2025/)

**Crash Risk - Kapoor Descent:** Major crash point where entire chase group except two riders went down at "the toughest corner on the descent" - "the first guy sail straight off the corner into the trees, and everyone behind him slid one by one to the scene of the accident." Search and rescue had to be mobilized. [ELITE group] (https://bookofchad.ca/2025/05/19/burnt-bridge-classic-gravel-2025/)

**Mechanical DNF:** At least one DNF recorded - Chandra Kalke [Masters 35-44 Female] did not finish. Additionally, SRAM drivetrain failure left one rider single-speed mid-race. (https://www.webscorer.com/racealldetails?raceid=390636)

**Wildlife Hazard:** Black bear encounter mid-descent: "a large black bear decided to join the road in front of me" [ELITE experience] (https://bookofchad.ca/2025/05/19/burnt-bridge-classic-gravel-2025/)
