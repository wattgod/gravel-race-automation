# BELGIAN WAFFLE RIDE ARIZONA — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Sam Andrews [ELITE]:** "The course was a tantalizing blend of treacherous terrain, featuring undulating hills, specially designed MTB trails, rugged sand washes, and bumpy 4×4 roads. And all of this set against a picturesque backdrop of the stunning desert rock and prickly cacti... As we set off on a neutral roll out, we were almost immediately faced with a long, grueling climb. At first, it was a peaceful ascent with friendly chatter, but soon after, the pace intensified, and Pete Stetina led the charge up the steep inclines. Despite my best efforts, I found myself in the second chasing group, struggling to keep up with the lead pack." Finished top 30 overall and top 20 in age category. (https://burgh.cc/belgian-waffle-ride-arizona/)

**Sofia Gomez Villafañe [ELITE]:** "It's probably one of the hardest races we do all year, and you just never really know how it's gonna shake out." (https://veloracycling.com/events/belgian-waffle-ride-arizona-2026/preview)

**Keegan Swenson [ELITE]:** "Today's race was a true test of endurance and strategy. The competition was fierce, and I'm thrilled to have come out on top. The BWR series is unlike any other, and I'm excited to continue racing in this incredible environment." Won 2025 edition in 5h 21m 56s, beating Russell Finsterwald by 3 seconds.

**Ed Philbrick [ELITE]:** "I cavalierly skipped an aid station with porta-potties. Big mistake. Urgency hit mid-race on a bumpy, rocky section in McDowell. I barely found a bush in time—7 minutes stoppage. Emergency Stop #2? Near classic AZ dirt-road motorhome garages... 8 minutes of stoppage... No Wafer aid station before the final climb had riders scrambling—some begging for a squirt of water... At least one rider slumped over on the curb, too spent to coast to the finish." Notes dealing with food poisoning/stomach flu during race. (https://servicecoursereport.substack.com/p/tour-de-dumoulin)

**Andrew L'Esperance [ELITE]:** Podiumed third on a rigid fork, "figured tire selection and handling mattered more on BWR Arizona's smoother, loose terrain. Plus, his current setup wasn't dialed for suspension, so why mess with what works?" (https://veloracycling.com/events/belgian-waffle-ride-arizona-2026/preview)

**Zach Calton [ELITE]:** Finished fifth running suspension fork "to gain speed and reduce fatigue on the gnarly descents. Smart move—conserving energy on long races is huge." (https://veloracycling.com/events/belgian-waffle-ride-arizona-2026/preview)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

### Tires

**Continental Race Kings [ELITE-FOCUSED]:** "Most pros ran MTB tires: Continental Race Kings were everywhere, sponsor obligations or not. Finsterwald on 2.0 Race Kings the slower compound vs the 2.2 faster because larger is faster and comes in faster Hot Chilly compound." Keegan Swenson ran "front 2.4 and rear 2.25 tires." (https://servicecoursereport.substack.com/p/tour-de-dumoulin)

**Maxxis Aspens [ELITE-FOCUSED]:** "Maxxis Aspens & Aspen ST (MaxxSpeed EXO/TR Team Spec) were common—not the lighter Maxxis Aspen MaxxSpeed EXO/TR. Keegan was on front 2.4 and rear 2.25 tires." (https://servicecoursereport.substack.com/p/tour-de-dumoulin)

**Specialized Prototype Setup [ELITE - Sofia Gomez Villafañe]:** "Ran a prototype Specialized race tire up front with a Tracer gravel tire in the rear, limited by the Specialized Crux's clearance. The new Specialized Air Trak 2.2 (soon in 2.35, unknown 2.2 shipping date) and tan-sidewall Tracers are dropping soon. Her rear tire looked 47C—a size stacking up wins this season." (https://servicecoursereport.substack.com/p/tour-de-dumoulin)

**General Tire Advice [ALL LEVELS]:** "Many experienced participants opt for 40-45mm rubber with aggressive side knobs to manage loose corners and rocky descents." (https://veloracycling.com/events/belgian-waffle-ride-arizona-2026/preview)

**Ed Philbrick Setup [ELITE]:** "Front Tire: Race King 2.2 (2mm clearance, fork acting as a cactus-spin catcher). This is a fantastic tire setup. 23 PSI. Rear Tire: Panaracer Gravelking X1 40C at 36 PSI (Big Ed Pressure)." (https://servicecoursereport.substack.com/p/tour-de-dumoulin)

### Suspension

**Fork Choice [ELITE-SPECIFIC]:** "Rob Britton, Russell Finsterwald, and Keegan Swenson ran front suspension (Fox and RockShox). Drew Dillman (Bonk Bros podcast) and Chase Wark (solo artist and Bonk Bros friend) rocked Lauf forks." (https://servicecoursereport.substack.com/p/tour-de-dumoulin)

**Lauf Bikes [ALL LEVELS]:** "Lauf bikes showed up in the age groups—their 50C clearance is compelling for MTB tires." (https://servicecoursereport.substack.com/p/tour-de-dumoulin)

### Other Equipment

**Tubeless Systems [ALL LEVELS]:** "Tubeless systems with appropriate sealant help protect against the frequent puncture risk from desert flora." (https://veloracycling.com/events/belgian-waffle-ride-arizona-2026/preview)

**Wider Gear Range [ALL LEVELS]:** "A wider gear range than typical gravel setups helps manage the steep pitches." (https://veloracycling.com/events/belgian-waffle-ride-arizona-2026/preview)

**Pro Cockpit Trends [ELITE-FOCUSED]:** "Flat forearm positioning on narrow 36 and 38cm bars for aerodynamics. Flipped-in Remco levers for better control. MTB-style tires are gaining traction (literally)." (https://servicecoursereport.substack.com/p/tour-de-dumoulin)

**Ed Philbrick Equipment [ELITE]:** "Bike: Grail CF 2 SLX Shimano GRX 2X -I think I will go 1X after California BWR. My Silica drip waxed chain was so loud... Garmin leash: Saved my Garmin 1050 after a crash. Enduro XD15 bottom bracket & hub bearings: Yes, I can hose my bike off and still roll heavy and fast because of the nitrogen steel races with Silicon Nitride Grade 5 ceramic balls." (https://servicecoursereport.substack.com/p/tour-de-dumoulin)

## Weather Experienced

**Late February Conditions:** "Late February weather typically brings highs of 20-24°C (68–75°F) with morning temperatures potentially dipping to 7°C (45°F). However, the intense desert sun and minimal shade mean dehydration becomes a genuine concern by midday." (https://veloracycling.com/events/belgian-waffle-ride-arizona-2026/preview)

**2025 Race Day [ELITE Experience]:** Ed Philbrick noted "25 MPH side gusts tested concentration" during the final descent, and referenced "heat of midday" as a significant factor in the final technical sections. (https://servicecoursereport.substack.com/p/tour-de-dumoulin)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Opening Climbs:** "We were almost immediately faced with a long, grueling climb.

[ELITE - Sam Andrews] (https://burgh.cc/belgian-waffle-ride-arizona/)

**Course Opening [ALL LEVELS]:** "The route opens with two substantial paved climbs, the second stretching 6.4 miles at 4.7% gradient, lifting riders to a high point around 4,000 feet. From there, a 1,500-foot descent on rocky jeep roads takes riders into the open desert." (https://veloracycling.com/events/belgian-waffle-ride-arizona-2026/preview)

**McDowell Regional Park Section [ALL LEVELS]:** "30 miles of McDowell Regional Park singletrack. Sweeping turns, loose surfaces and proximity to unforgiving cacti demand constant concentration." One rider noted it's "the most technical terrain of the whole race." (https://veloracycling.com/events/belgian-waffle-ride-arizona-2026/preview and https://www.progravelmagazine.com/post/belgian-waffel-ride-arizona-preview)

**Early Pacing Warning [ELITE - Sam Andrews]:** "As soon as we hit the first off-road sector, I kicked into high gear, determined to make up lost ground and tackle the challenging terrain with all my might." Notes being dropped early on climbs despite best efforts. (https://burgh.cc/belgian-waffle-ride-arizona/)

**Ego Management [ELITE - Derin Stockton advice to Ed Philbrick]:** "Last time I saw you let your ego get the better of you, it ended with you hitting the deck. Let go of that shit. Slow and steady, work your way into it." Ed notes: "I started at the back, pacing myself, but quickly moved forward—then my ego kicked in. I have this thing about pants and board shorts being ahead of me." (https://servicecoursereport.substack.com/p/tour-de-dumoulin)

**McDowell Section Tactics [ELITE]:** "This section of the course proved to be decisive last year as it keeps the racing single file and exposes even the most elite racers to mistakes, as a potential slip sits around each sweeping bend." (https://www.progravelmagazine.com/post/belgian-waffel-ride-arizona-preview)

(https://servicecoursereport.substack.com/p/tour-de-dumoulin)

**Pro/Amateur Mixing:** "The pros grumble about catching the wafer riders, and the wafer riders grumble about having to pull over into dead cactus to let the pros pass.
