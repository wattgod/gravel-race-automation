# BWR ASHEVILLE — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Pete Stetina [ELITE]:** "The first half of 2022 has been a struggle for me. I've been dealing with continuous setbacks and logistical challenges all spring. It seems I just couldn't find the groove that I'd had in 2021, both results and enjoyment-wise. I was determined to rectify that, sinus pressure be damned." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/road/road-culture/groad-trip-utterly-spent-at-bwr-asheville/)

**Pete Stetina [ELITE]:** "In over 130 miles, we climbed nearly 14,000 ft, a full 3,000 more than the California edition. The race conditions are quintessentially east coast: muggy and humid with dense foliage and rushing rivers... Perhaps my favorite part of the weekend was a lack of something: cellular service. The venue is at a summer camp deep in the woods and many don't get a signal in there. The only time phones came out were for pictures. It forced the masses to live in the present and socialize." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/road/road-culture/groad-trip-utterly-spent-at-bwr-asheville/)

**Pete Stetina [ELITE]:** "After 50 miles, we encountered a particularly vicious double track wall where only a few didn't walk. That was followed by a cyclocross-style descent, and a select group of eight emerged... Shortly after, we hit the biggest climb of the day in which Paul Voss decided he wanted to pare it down further. Four of us — Voss, Nathan Haas, Griffin Easter, and myself summited, but Griffin punctured shortly after." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/road/road-culture/groad-trip-utterly-spent-at-bwr-asheville/)

**Pete Stetina [ELITE]:** "We ripped down the back and into one of most fun singletracks I've ever raced on drop bars. We pushed it to the limit over rock jumps, bridges, and into the old barn. Despite being on the limit trying to follow Haas, who is a very good bike handler, I found myself whooping and squealing with adrenaline." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/road/road-culture/groad-trip-utterly-spent-at-bwr-asheville/)

**Pete Stetina [ELITE]:** "Upon the second time doing the same climb, we were detoured into a rough primitive jeep track. It was there I made my final move. There were still 45 miles to go, but I sensed the others were on the back foot there so I bet on myself... I quickly put four minutes into them over the subsequent rollers, but then the lights began to flicker. Some combination of Unbound fatigue and my sinus infection, and my endurance ran out. The final hour of the race consisted of pitifully pedaling squares... I limped to the line completely and utterly spent and promptly collapsed." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/road/road-culture/groad-trip-utterly-spent-at-bwr-asheville/)

**RedFroRacing [UNKNOWN]:** "So, this is actually my first post on this blog, and I thought It would be about my feelings for the upcoming race I registered for this weekend, Belgian Waffle Ride, Asheville, NC. I plan on racing the Wafer distance. (70 miles) To tell you the truth, I was feeling pretty darn anxious about this" (https://redfroracing.wordpress.com/category/cycling/)

**RedFroRacing [UNKNOWN]:** "In my last post I said that I was feeling a bit anxious about this race, but I'm happy to reveal It went great! Taper Leading up to Race Day I personally find that I respond well to a 2 day taper before race day, reducing to 50-75% of original training day volume 2 days" (https://redfroracing.wordpress.com/category/cycling/)

**astromike48 [UNKNOWN]:** "May run it for BWR Asheville later this month" [referring to a Giant Propel with 32mm tires] (https://www.reddit.com/user/astromike48/)

**lazycouncilor [UNKNOWN]:** "I did a 40 mile gravel loop in Pisgah on the MTB last month so I'm certain it can handle it, but the Roubaix is way lighter for 10k feet of climbing." (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/s4q6fx/thinking_of_doing_the_belgian_waffle_ride_in/)

**rvmtz92 [UNKNOWN]:** "Anyone going/done 1x? Or is that too crazy for 12,000 ft of climbing? If you've done it 1x, what was your set up? I can convert to 2x with my 48/32 chainrings and up to a 11-42 cassette with my GRX group set, but I really like 1x. Would consider switching to a sram eagle mullet set up if that range would get keep me 1x and not die." (https://www.reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/mbx6yo/whats_your_bwr_drivetrain_set_up_1x_or_2x/)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**[UNKNOWN] - Tire Width Concerns:** Reddit user lazycouncilor debating between a Roubaix with 32mm knobby tires vs an 80s MTB with 26" 2.2 tires, questioning: "Anyone who has done the ride think 32mm wouldn't be enough?" (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/s4q6fx/thinking_of_doing_the_belgian_waffle_ride_in/)

**[UNKNOWN] - Drivetrain Setup:** One rider noted a Giant Propel "fits some 32mm tires" and considered running it for BWR Asheville (https://www.reddit.com/user/astromike48/)

**[UNKNOWN] - 1x vs 2x Debate:** Rider considering GRX 48/32 chainrings with 11-42 cassette (2x) vs SRAM Eagle mullet setup (1x) for the 12,000 ft of climbing, noting "I live in a flat area, so I can't really test out different combos until I start traveling for climbing camps." (https://www.reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/mbx6yo/whats_your_bwr_drivetrain_set_up_1x_or_2x/)

**[UNKNOWN] - Bike Choice Considerations:** CharlieTurnover was considering Factor LS, Pinerello Grevail, or Open U.P. as replacements for a broken 3T Exploro, noting they're "a roadie and feel most comfortable on roadie-like bikes" and do "some gravel events/races, but ride the bike more for endurance/easy road rides and commuting." They considered an endurance road bike like Cervelo Caledonia "but can't quite get my head around doing rides like BWR Asheville on 35 tires." (https://www.reddit.com/r/whichbike/comments/tgpq8g/broken_exploro_replace/)

## Weather Experienced

**Pete Stetina [ELITE] - 2022:** "The race conditions are quintessentially east coast: muggy and humid with dense foliage and rushing rivers." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/road/road-culture/groad-trip-utterly-spent-at-bwr-asheville/)

**Official Description [UNKNOWN]:** "The race will run in hot and humid conditions over undulating terrain and difficult off-load sectors." (https://strambecco.com/event/belgian-waffle-ride-asheville-north-carolina/)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Pete Stetina [ELITE] - 2022 Specific Course Details:** "After 50 miles, we encountered a particularly vicious double track wall where only a few didn't walk. That was followed by a cyclocross-style descent... Shortly after, we hit the biggest climb of the day... Upon the second time doing the same climb, we were detoured into a rough primitive jeep track." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/road/road-culture/groad-trip-utterly-spent-at-bwr-asheville/)

**Pete Stetina [ELITE] - Technical Sections:** "We ripped down the back and into one of most fun singletracks I've ever raced on drop bars. We pushed it to the limit over rock jumps, bridges, and into the old barn." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/road/road-culture/groad-trip-utterly-spent-at-bwr-asheville/)

**Pete Stetina [ELITE] - Course Variety:** "The route combines pristine pavement, smooth and chunky gravel roads, sinuous single track, and more. We crossed old bridges next to waterfalls, hairpin down tracks cut through grass fields, and even race through a barn complete with a drum line." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/road/road-culture/groad-trip-utterly-spent-at-bwr-asheville/)

**Official Description:** "The 2023 event route will be shorter and less hilly, still featuring so much of the area's glorious greenery. The Belgian Waffle Ride North Carolina (Asheville) 2026 is possibly the hilliest of the BWR Series events. Last year, it was roughly 131 miles and over 13,000 feet of climbing, making it the most challenging of all the 2024 BWR courses and earning it the title of THE HELL OF THE EAST." (https://strambecco.com/event/belgian-waffle-ride-asheville-north-carolina/)

**2025 Course Details:** "Waffle Ride (~100 miles, 8,000 feet), Wafer Ride (~56 miles), Wanna Ride (~26 miles)" - Note: This represents a significant reduction in both distance and elevation from previous years. (https://www.belgianwaffleride.bike/pages/northcarolina)

**2023 Course:** "134 miles and 13,000 feet of climbing. The main Waffle route will feature many unpaved sections with various surfaces, from hard-packed and flat to loose, rocky, uphill, and downhill gravel." (https://strambecco.com/event/belgian-waffle-ride-asheville-north-carolina/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Pete Stetina [ELITE] - Race Dynamics:** "After 50 miles... a select group of eight emerged. We rotated well together realizing this could be the race if we collaborated. Shortly after, we hit the biggest climb of the day in which Paul Voss decided he wanted to pare it down further. Four of us — Voss, Nathan Haas, Griffin Easter, and myself summited." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/road/road-culture/groad-trip-utterly-spent-at-bwr-asheville/)

**Pete Stetina [ELITE] - Early Aggressiveness Risk:** "We ripped down the back and into one of most fun singletracks... Despite being on the limit trying to follow Haas, who is a very good bike handler, I found myself whooping and squealing with adrenaline. It was only after that we realized we still had a very long way to go and came to the understanding how our early exuberance might become our downfall." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/road/road-culture/groad-trip-utterly-spent-at-bwr-asheville/)

**Pete Stetina [ELITE] - Late Race Move:** "Upon the second time doing the same climb, we were detoured into a rough primitive jeep track. It was there I made my final move. There were still 45 miles to go, but I sensed the others were on the back foot there so I bet on myself. Plus, I figured a head start for the coming descent was a good idea against a rider like Haasy." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/road/road-culture/groad-trip-utterly-spent-at-bwr-asheville/)

**Pete Stetina [ELITE] - Fatigue Pattern:** "I quickly put four minutes into them over the subsequent rollers, but then the lights began to flicker. Some combination of Unbound fatigue and my sinus infection, and my endurance ran out. The final hour of the race consisted of pitifully pedaling squares and constantly asking the media crews for any sort of time gap." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/road/road-culture/groad-trip-utterly-spent-at-bwr-asheville/)

**RedFroRacing [UNKNOWN] - Taper Strategy:** "I personally find that I respond well to a 2 day taper before race day, reducing to 50-75% of original training day volume 2 days" (https://redfroracing.wordpress.com/category/cycling/)

**Training Plan Available:** "Monuments of Cycling has partnered with FasCat Coaching to create a customized Belgian Waffle Ride North Carolina training plan. It is a comprehensive six-week training plan starting on January 22. Tailored to various skill levels and time commitments, the Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced plans cater to participants taking on the 35-mile Wanna, 70-mile Wafer, or 130ish-mile Waffle courses. The centerpiece of each week is a progressively extended gravel simulation ride, mirroring the race's demands." (https://strambecco.com/event/belgian-waffle-ride-asheville-north-carolina/)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Pete Stetina [ELITE] - Recovery from Previous Events:** "In the days leading up to the Belgian Waffle Ride Asheville, the biggest question for me and many of my competitors was — had we recovered from the muddy Unbound 200 seven days earlier? Sickness seemed to be ripping through the ranks, whether it was Covid, stomach troubles from dirty bottles, or colds. I was a bit surprised some contenders, both in the men's and women's fields, didn't start; I'd personally rather lose a few minutes due to bad legs than completely remove myself from contention in the BWR Quadruple Crown classification. Some of my competitors did just that, unable to bring themselves to compete." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/road/road-culture/groad-trip-utterly-spent-at-bwr-asheville/)

**Griffin Easter [ELITE] - Mechanical:** "Four of us — Voss, Nathan Haas, Griffin Easter, and myself summited, but Griffin punctured shortly after." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/road/road-culture/groad-trip-utterly-spent-at-bwr-asheville/)

**General Risk Factors:** The 2024 race report noted Josh Burnett finished in 05:49:40 while the last finisher came in at 12:32:44 - a massive time spread indicating significant attrition and difficulty for mid-pack riders. 136 starters in the men's Waffle. (https://results.bikereg.com/race/20095)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Pete Stetina [ELITE] - Venue Atmosphere:** "Perhaps my favorite part of the weekend was a lack of something: cellular service. The venue is at a beautiful summer camp deep in the woods and many don't get a signal in there. The only time phones came out were for pictures. It forced the masses to live in the present and socialize. In a world where our attention is almost always split between multiple platforms vying for our attention, it was relaxing to just live in the present." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/road/road-culture/groad-trip-utterly-spent-at-bwr-asheville/)

**Pete Stetina [ELITE] - Post-Race:** "The sun was shining, the breeze was perfect, and the jovial celebration by many ensued. For many this was the biggest ride they'd ever done, and that was cause for celebration. It was also nice to take a victory after enough frustration earlier this year." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/road/road-culture/groad-trip-utterly-spent-at-bwr-asheville/)

**Venue Description:** "The host location for the event is Ride Kanuga Bike Park located in Hendersonville, NC, an incredible destination nestled on 1,400 stunning acres in the Blue Ridge Mountains. Its historic setting features a beautiful 30-acre lake, 20 miles of trails, and full-service meeting and lodging facilities for up to 440 guests." (https://strambecco.com/event/belgian-waffle-ride-asheville-north-carolina/)

**2025 Event Schedule - Community Elements:** "Happy Hour presented by Pinebury with Wagyu Wagon Food: 5–7:00pm (RSVP required). Rider Briefing with Frankie Andreu: 2:00pm. Shakeout Burrito Ride with DARC & AYC: 12:30pm" (https://www.belgianwaffleride.bike/pages/northcarolina)

**Local Partners & Community Support:** Event partners with local cycling community including "Downtown Asheville Racing Club (DARC) – Hosts of Friday's Shakeout Ride. They embody the cycling culture of Asheville and help us kick things off in style. Asheville Youth Cycling (AYC) – The nonprofit we're proud to support this year. Proceeds from the Shakeout Burrito Ride go directly to helping young riders discover the joy of cycling." (https://www.belgianwaffleride.bike/pages/northcarolina)

**Support Infrastructure:** "You can expect well-marked and abundant traffic control personnel on the course, plus police and official vehicle escorts. Additionally, each location will be hosted by a legion of like-minded volunteers who come together to showcase the hospitality of the Asheville community. Throughout the ride, cyclists can find solace in the well-stocked aid stations every 20 miles." (https://strambecco.com/event/belgian-waffle-ride-asheville-north-carolina/)

**Notable Story - Ned Overend:** "The big story of the day was 70 year-old cycling legend Ned Overend (SPECIALIZED) winning the shorter 56 mile Belgian Wafer Ride. Not only did the first ever MTB World Champion (1990) win, the septuagenarian destroyed a field of graveleurs more than half his age, finishing solo in 2:49:14. Up-and-coming 17 year-olds Eden Baier-miles 2:57:44 and Asher Krider 2:59:44 finished a humble second and third place."
