# BELGIAN WAFFLE RIDE — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Yun (Threshold Cycling) [RECREATIONAL]:** "Between a new job, family-wide respiratory illness, and a never-ending sleep deficit, this wasn't exactly the ideal lead-up to a 100-mile gravel race... We were two of just 21 women to finish the Waffle that day. Only about two-thirds of the 300 men finished." (https://thresholdcycling.com/blogs/training-resources/from-doubt-to-dirt-my-grit-fueled-ride-at-belgian-waffle)

**Yun [RECREATIONAL]:** "We got caught behind bottlenecks on early singletrack—losing nearly 45 minutes before the race even really began... My power was fading, and I struggled to keep up. A high-speed descent brought a jolt of joy—until we realized that incredible drop meant a brutal climb back up." (https://thresholdcycling.com/blogs/training-resources/from-doubt-to-dirt-my-grit-fueled-ride-at-belgian-waffle)

**Yun [RECREATIONAL]:** "Somewhere in the chaos, I dropped my chain, lost Keri, missed a trail, and somehow ended up ahead of her. Once we reunited, we began the soul-crushing climb through what I now call Death Valley—aka Pamo Valley... The final three gravel hills were so steep that I had to push my bike. Keri? She fishtailed up them like a legend." (https://thresholdcycling.com/blogs/training-resources/from-doubt-to-dirt-my-grit-fueled-ride-at-belgian-waffle)

**Yun [RECREATIONAL]:** "Gravel isn't just harder than road—it's way more dynamic, and honestly, a lot more fun." (https://thresholdcycling.com/blogs/training-resources/from-doubt-to-dirt-my-grit-fueled-ride-at-belgian-waffle)

**Adam Roberge [COMPETITIVE]:** "Gravel races are long, and my default approach was to try to have fun for at least part of it—this quest included looking at the scenery, joking with fellow riders, and everything else I do in training to make it more fun. Last weekend at BWR Utah was the most fun I've had in a gravel race in a long time, and I committed to strict focus throughout the race." (https://adamroberge.com/2024/04/563/)

**Adam Roberge [COMPETITIVE]:** "You're coming in full speed on the road into these singletrack paths sections on a road bike... It's like, alright, hold on, and buckle up. It is wild." Via interview with Pete Stetina (https://adamroberge.com/2024/04/563/)

**Pete Stetina [ELITE]:** "I went to BWR for fun. A buddy in Santa Rosa was like, 'You gotta check this thing out, it's fun.'... In the race there was a car following us with the media and there was a movie being produced and afterward you're whisked away to a green screen and shoved beer and waffles and you're all grimy, and it was so cool." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/what-riders-say-about-belgian-waffle-ride-buckle-up-its-wild/)

**Pete Stetina [ELITE]:** "I remember the pain, honestly. I went deep, really deep, I was really surprised. I was personally more screwed up for longer than after Dirty Kanza. Kanza was pure gravel grinding; you're emptying the tank and slogging, and the ultimate test of endurance. BWR was racing. It was attacks. High power, there was more muscle damage there." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/what-riders-say-about-belgian-waffle-ride-buckle-up-its-wild/)

**Sarah Sturm [ELITE]:** "For most of the race I thought I was off of the back. The start of that thing is absolute chaos. I had no idea where any of the women were, I just assumed that they were all in front of me. So when I asked the camera men following me who was ahead and they said nobody, I was really surprised." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/what-riders-say-about-belgian-waffle-ride-buckle-up-its-wild/)

**Keegan Swenson [ELITE]:** "Today's race was a true test of endurance and strategy. The competition was fierce, and I'm thrilled to have come out on top. The BWR series is unlike any other, and I'm excited to continue racing in this incredible environment." (https://www.granfondoguide.com/Contents/PopUp/8408/villafañe-and-swenson-dominate-at-the-3rd-edition-of-belgian-waffle-ride-arizona)

**Sofia Gomez Villafañe [ELITE]:** "They keep saying he's won the most, but we were tied coming into this weekend with six wins each. So now I'm at seven. Sorry Pete, the title is mine." (https://www.cyclingnews.com/races/belgian-waffle-ride-series-2025/bwr-california-waffle-pro-women-pro-men/results/)

**Matt Beers [ELITE]:** "This year has been a little bit of a rough start, like [Cape] Epic didn't go to plan and then I've had a lot of second places, which kind of irritates me a lot. So it's nice to get the monkey off the back again." (https://www.cyclingnews.com/races/belgian-waffle-ride-series-2025/bwr-california-waffle-pro-women-pro-men/results/)

**Matt Beers [ELITE]:** "I think I corner a little better than those two. On the singletrack, I knew I could take time the whole way." (https://www.cyclingnews.com/races/belgian-waffle-ride-series-2025/bwr-california-waffle-pro-women-pro-men/results/)

**Peter Stetina [ELITE]:** "Matt took a corner scary fast and there was a small gap. I couldn't close it. That was the split of the race. I just looked at Alexey [Vermeulen] and [started] racing for second. It was a good race. I can say I had a great day, and some of the best legs I've had in a long time. Matt Beers was the cat and I was his ball of yarn." (https://www.cyclingnews.com/races/belgian-waffle-ride-series-2025/bwr-california-waffle-pro-women-pro-men/results/)

**lazycouncilor [UNKNOWN]:** "I did a 40 mile gravel loop in Pisgah on the MTB last month so I'm certain it can handle it, but the Roubaix is way lighter for 10k feet of climbing." Regarding choosing between bikes for BWR NC. (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/s4q6fx/thinking_of_doing_the_belgian_waffle_ride_in/)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**[RECREATIONAL - Yun]:** Successfully used dates rolled in granola with peanut butter and salt, Stryker Gels, NeverSecond drink mix, LMNT salts, and gummies. Completed the 100-mile Waffle distance in just under 10 hours. (https://thresholdcycling.com/blogs/training-resources/from-doubt-to-dirt-my-grit-fueled-ride-at-belgian-waffle)

**[COMPETITIVE - Adam Roberge]:** Used Rule 28 Long Sleeve Aero Jersey and Aero Bib Tights for all 2024 gravel races: "In the past, I often felt like I had to choose between staying warm and being aerodynamic. I no longer have this issue with the Rule 28 Long Sleeve Aero Jersey and Aero Bib Tights." (https://adamroberge.com/2024/04/563/)

**[ELITE - Pete Stetina/General]:** "Even though pavement makes up the majority of the BWR course, miles of rocky sections like this encourage knobby tires." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/what-riders-say-about-belgian-waffle-ride-buckle-up-its-wild/)

**[UNKNOWN - lazycouncilor]:** Debating between a Roubaix with 32mm knobby tires vs 80s MTB with 26" 2.2 tires for BWR NC's 10k feet of climbing. Community discussion suggests 32mm may not be enough for technical sections. (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/s4q6fx/thinking_of_doing_the_belgian_waffle_ride_in/)

## Weather Experienced

**2025 BWR California:** Winds gusting from the Pacific Ocean at 20 mph. Course was 106.5 miles with 7,500 feet of climbing. Elite winner Sofia Gomez Villafañe noted: "I had a worse time going out, on the way back I had friends" (referring to wind conditions). (https://www.cyclingnews.com/races/belgian-waffle-ride-series-2025/bwr-california-waffle-pro-women-pro-men/results/)

**2024 BWR Utah:** Late start at 9:00 AM to allow temperature to rise above 0°C. Less than one week before the race, snow rendered two sections unrideable, forcing course shortening to 166km. Altitude range: approximately 1600m to 2200m. (https://adamroberge.com/2024/04/563/)

**2025 BWR California (San Diego):** Weather was described as cool enough that one rider noted: "At least the weather's cool" while suffering on climbs. (https://thresholdcycling.com/blogs/training-resources/from-doubt-to-dirt-my-grit-fueled-ride-at-belgian-waffle)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**BWR California 2025 Specific Sections [RECREATIONAL - Yun]:** "Highland Valley" identified as particularly brutal: "Oh Highland Valley, I will never forget you!!!" Followed by "Death Valley—aka Pamo Valley" with soul-crushing climbs and fierce headwinds on return. Final section included "a dam, a lake, an eternal set of switchbacks, and the choice between a hike-a-bike or a creek crossing. We chose the creek—and slammed our bikes into hidden boulders. I went full submersion." (https://thresholdcycling.com/blogs/training-resources/from-doubt-to-dirt-my-grit-fueled-ride-at-belgian-waffle)

**BWR California 2025 [RECREATIONAL - Yun]:** Early singletrack sections created massive bottlenecks. With 1,500 riders rolling out together, riders lost nearly 45 minutes before the race even began due to congestion. Aid station 3 was around mile 60, where volunteers warned future aid stops might not be manned. (https://thresholdcycling.com/blogs/training-resources/from-doubt-to-dirt-my-grit-fueled-ride-at-belgian-waffle)

**BWR Utah 2024 [COMPETITIVE - Adam Roberge]:** "The first 20km were straightforward until we turned left and encountered a strong crosswind. The lead car, inadvertently while taking photos, helped create a front selection by blocking the wind... After 10km of easier riding, I timed an attack perfectly and broke away solo, ideally positioning myself to enter the single track first. I navigated the beach sector—a rugged double track—alone, and was then caught by a small lead group just as I entered the 10km single track." Course included a final 4km climb at 6% gradient. (https://adamroberge.com/2024/04/563/)

**BWR California 2025 Course Layout [ELITE]:** "At 106.5 miles in length, this year's BWR Calif is the shortest edition in 14 years. There is 7,500 feet of climbing with relentless terrain shifts that are a mix of 50% fast pavement and 50% 'unroad', comprised of deep sand, singletrack, a rock garden, creek crossing and gravel... Just before dirt sector three of 25 headed toward the single track that hugged the San Dieguito River in the Del Dios Gorge." Three-mile stretch of sandy areas and rocky single track caused multiple crashes/mechanicals. (https://www.cyclingnews.com/races/belgian-waffle-ride-series-2025/bwr-california-waffle-pro-women-pro-men/results/)

**BWR Arizona 2025 [ELITE]:** "A mix of mountain and desert with a smattering of good times and fast racing! The race, a grueling 103.5 miles through the rugged desert terrain surrounding Scottsdale, showcased the grit and determination of the athletes as they tackled 7,062 feet of climbing." Known for its "gravel-centric focus" with varied terrain and demanding elevation changes. (https://www.granfondoguide.com/Contents/PopUp/8408/villafañe-and-swenson-dominate-at-the-3rd-edition-of-belgian-waffle-ride-arizona)

**BWR General Terrain Characteristics:** "Asphalt, gravel, singletrack, sand, water crossings, cyclocross-style chaos—each course a curated blend of madness and magnificence." Pete Stetina compared it to "an Ardennes race mixed with singletrack. You're coming in full speed on the road into these singletrack paths sections on a road bike." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/what-riders-say-about-belgian-waffle-ride-buckle-up-its-wild/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**[COMPETITIVE - Adam Roberge] BWR Utah 2024:** TSS: 299, Intensity Factor: 0.781, Calories: 4,508 over 166km at altitude (1600-2200m). Race time approximately 5h 26m for third place. Key mental mantra: "Fear nothing, respect everything / fear no one, respect everyone." Emphasizes: "A higher commitment to getting all the details right makes the experience more enjoyable... Last weekend at BWR Utah was the most fun I've had in a gravel race in a long time, and I committed to strict focus throughout the race." (https://adamroberge.com/2024/04/563/)

**[RECREATIONAL - Yun & Keri] BWR California 2025:** Finished in just under 10 hours (beating the 10-hour cutoff). Strategy involved skipping first aid station and sprinting between cutoffs. At Station 2, they had to beat an 11:30 a.m. deadline. At Station 3 (mile 60), they stuffed pockets with bars, gels, and Coke after learning future aid stops might not be manned. Key lesson: "If we hadn't gotten stuck early on, understood the course layout better, and been more rested, we know we could've shaved off a chunk of time." (https://thresholdcycling.com/blogs/training-resources/from-doubt-to-dirt-my-grit-fueled-ride-at-belgian-waffle)

**[ELITE - Keegan Swenson] BWR Arizona 2025:** Finished in 5h 21m 56s, winning by only 3 seconds over Russell Finsterwald. This indicates sprint-level intensity at the finish despite 103.5-mile distance. (https://www.granfondoguide.com/Contents/PopUp/8408/villafañe-and-swenson-dominate-at-the-3rd-edition-of-belgian-waffle-ride-arizona)

**[ELITE - Sofia Gomez Villafañe] BWR California 2025:** Went clear of other elite women just 20 miles into the race: "I liked it [the new course], I mean the time was still long. I had a worse time going out, on the way back I had friends." Finished in 5h 43m 22s, over 33 minutes ahead of second place. Strategy involved going hard early despite 106.5-mile distance. (https://www.cyclingnews.com/races/belgian-waffle-ride-series-2025/bwr-california-waffle-pro-women-pro-men/results/)

**[ELITE - Matt Beers] BWR California 2025:** Won in 4h 57m 08s. Made decisive gap on "a long, technical descent... I think I corner a little better than those two. On the singletrack, I knew I could take time the whole way." Finished 9:31 ahead of Peter Stetina. (https://www.cyclingnews.com/races/belgian-waffle-ride-series-2025/bwr-california-waffle-pro-women-pro-men/results/)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Bottlenecks and Time Cutoffs [RECREATIONAL - Yun]:** With 1,500 riders starting together, early singletrack bottlenecks cost some riders nearly 45 minutes: "we couldn't even see the front of the pack where we were supposed to start. With 1,500 riders rolling out together, we got caught behind bottlenecks on early singletrack—losing nearly 45 minutes before the race even really began." This put riders at risk of missing subsequent cutoffs throughout the race. (https://thresholdcycling.com/blogs/training-resources/from-doubt-to-dirt-my-grit-fueled-ride-at-belgian-waffle)

**Finisher Statistics [RECREATIONAL - Yun] BWR California 2025:** Only 21 women finished the Waffle distance. Only about two-thirds (approximately 200 of 300) men finished the Waffle. This suggests approximately 30-35% DNF rate overall. (https://thresholdcycling.com/blogs/training-resources/from-doubt-to-dirt-my-grit-fueled-ride-at-belgian-waffle)

**Mechanical Issues and Crashes [ELITE] BWR California 2025:** In the Del Dios Gorge area's three-mile rocky single track section, Whitney Allison (Bike Sports) crashed and required stitches to her knee, leading to DNF. Courtney Sherwell (Santa Cruz SRAM) cracked a front rim on a rock garden, also leading to DNF. Both were in 2nd and 3rd place at the time. (https://www.cyclingnews.com/races/belgian-waffle-ride-series-2025/bwr-california-waffle-pro-women-pro-men/results/)

**Technical Terrain and Bike Choice:** Multiple riders debate whether certain bikes/tires are adequate. The combination of steep grades (15-17% reported), technical descents, rocky sections, and singletrack creates high mechanical risk for under-prepared equipment. (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/s4q6fx/thinking_of_doing_the_belgian_waffle_ride_in/)

**Unmanned Aid Stations [RECREATIONAL - Yun]:** At Station 3 (mile 60), volunteers warned that "future aid stops might not be manned." Riders had to carry sufficient nutrition for potentially 40-50 miles without support. (https://thresholdcycling.com/blogs/training-resources/from-doubt-to-dirt-my-grit-fueled-ride-at-belgian-waffle)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Production Quality and Media [ELITE - Pete Stetina]:** "In the race there was a car following us with the media and there was a movie being produced and afterward you're whisked away to a green screen and shoved beer and waffles and you're all grimy, and it was so cool. All of the production around the race was better and more professional than 90 percent of the pro races I've done in Europe." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/what-riders-say-about-belgian-waffle-ride-buckle-up-its-wild/)

**Social Media Impact [ELITE - Pete Stetina]:** "Afterwards, the social media metrics were unbelievable. And even in the Tour of California, I'm on this big ass climb, I'd been doing my job and riding at the front, and Richie Porte would be ahead going for the win and guys would be yelling at me 'Belgian Waffle Winner!' and I was like, holy cow, people actually care about this." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/what-riders-say-about-belgian-waffle-ride-buckle-up-its-wild/)

**Personal Connection [ELITE - Pete Stetina]:** "More importantly I was having fun and I could just be me. I could drink a beer and catch up with [Dave] Zabriskie at the expo and just have fun." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/what-riders-say-about-belgian-waffle-ride-buckle-up-its-wild/)

**Festival Atmosphere:** Every BWR weekend includes the two-day Unroad Expo: "Expect waffles hot off the iron, Belgian ales cold as sin, live music, vendors showcasing the latest gear, and families feasting on the spectacle. It's as much a party as it is a pilgrimage." All rider musette bags include "Pre- and Post-Race Waffles, Coffee & Beverages, Beer, Finisher's Trophy Beer." (https://www.granfondoguide.com/Series/BelgianWaffleRide)

**Unique Character [ELITE - Amity Rockwell]:** "BWR defies definition and that is exactly why it has a place here in the Monuments. You can't win by just being good at one thing, which I think encapsulates the essence of gravel racing. It's also a blast." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/what-riders-say-about-belgian-waffle-ride-buckle-up-its-wild/)

**Documentary Film:** The 2019 race was featured in the documentary film "Hell of the North," with producers taking before/after photos of athletes "to showcase their tired and dirt-covered faces and kits." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/what-riders-say-about-belgian-waffle-ride-buckle-up-its-wild/)

**Charitable Component:** The 2025+ BWR California partners with Curebound, a nonprofit dedicated to accelerating cancer research, with proceeds from the festival supporting the cause. (https://www.cyclingwest.com/gravel-biking/belgian-waffle-ride-unveils-ambitious-quad-tripel-crown-series-and-new-del-mar-venue-for-2025/)

**Bacon Hand-Ups:** The course features "bacon hand-ups" and "a finish at a brewery with its doors wide open to racers." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/what-riders-say-about-belgian-waffle-ride-buckle-up-its-wild/)
