# BELGIAN WAFFLE RIDE CALIFORNIA – RAW RESEARCH DUMP



**OFFICIAL DATA**
	•	**Location:** North San Diego County, California (typically starts/ends in San Marcos or nearby). BWR California is the flagship of the Belgian Waffle Ride series.
	•	**Distance:** “Waffle” (full course) ~130 miles (210 km). Historically 2019-2021 it was ~134-139 miles; in 2023 they introduced a new route ~~127.6 miles  . 2024 Waffle was ~128 miles. So expect ~125-135 miles depending on year’s course tweaks.
	•	**Elevation Gain:** Roughly **10,000–13,000 feet** of climbing depending on course  . The new 2023 route was ~10,500 ft , down from ~13k on older routes. So still a ton of climbing (the terrain is coastal hills with many short, steep climbs).
	•	**Date:** Spring annually (2024 was end of April; 2025 scheduled May 4-5 weekend) . Typically around late April or early May.
	•	**Field Size:** Around **1,200-1,500 riders** in the Waffle (long course) plus another ~1,000 in the Wafer (~70-80mi) and Wanna (~40mi) combined . Total participants ~2,500+. It’s non-lottery, first-come registration (sells out quickly).
	•	**Entry Cost:** BWR is not cheap: 2024 Waffle was ~$250-300 (and Wafer ~$200) per entry. Early-bird cheaper, procrastinator pricing higher. For 2025, likely similar range.
	•	**Route Composition:** BWR is famous for “unroad” mix. Roughly **80-89% off-road** (dirt, gravel, singletrack) and the rest paved . Actually their site says for CA: ~40% “unroad” which might include single/doubletrack and some hardpack dirt . The 2023 route had ~50 miles dirt (40%) and ~77 miles pavement (60%) . Historically it was about half paved, half dirt but the dirt can be extremely technical in places.
	•	**Cutoffs:** Yes, there are checkpoint cutoffs due to safety and permit limits. E.g., in 2022 they had cut-off times at certain aid stations (if you were too slow, you were directed to shortcut or pulled). Typically around 11-12 hours total time limit (if starting ~7am, finish by 6-7pm). They enforce because some sectors cross open roads and need to reopen or lose marshals.
	•	**Aid Stations:** Multiple feed zones (~4-5 on Waffle). Usually:
	•	Aid #1 ~30-40mi,
	•	Aid #2 ~60-70mi,
	•	Aid #3 ~90mi,
	•	Aid #4 ~110mi (approx).
They often have catchy names like “Hell Station” in Hellhole Canyon. They are well-stocked (water, electrolytes, gels, waffles, etc.). Some even had beer on tap (for the crazy or those who DNF and hang at an aid, since the theme is fun). They also have on-course marshals handing out water at a couple pinch points (like bottom of Double Peak sometimes).
	•	**Signature Sectors:** Key features are:
	•	**“Hellhole Canyon”** – a very rough, rocky dirt sector around miles 50-70 historically. Not sure if 2023 route included it differently, but Hellhole is infamous (hence the name). Many crashes and mechanicals occur here on steep rutted descents. It’s also remote and no cell signal (so truly hellish if you crash).
	•	**Double Peak** – the final climb, ~1,000 ft up to Double Peak Park at mile ~120. Steep grades up to 15-20%. This is the last big test and is paved but after 120mi, it’s brutal. They usually have a timed KOM/KOM on Double Peak.
	•	**Lakes Hodges trails** – early on and near end, singletrack around Lake Hodges (sandy, some rock gardens). It’s a bottleneck area early (masses funnel into singletrack).
	•	Many “Wafer” (medium) and “Wanna” (short) distances share parts of route but split off, which is a logistic to manage (usually separate start times).
	•	**Technical Difficulty:** BWR CA is regarded as the most technical gravel/“mixed surface” race. So much so, many ride it on hardtail MTBs or add dropper posts to gravel bikes. There’s singletrack where roadies freak out: sand pits, rocky descents, stream crossings. The course intentionally challenges bike handling. It’s not all gravels roads; quite a lot is mountain-bike style terrain.
	•	**Support/Rules:** It’s semi-supported: feed zones and neutral SAG are provided. Outside support usually not allowed except at feed zones. They strongly recommend GPS navigation as course marking can be missed (some who missed a turn ended up off-course).
	•	**Unique “Waiver” Requirements:** All riders sign a robust waiver and rules sheet (like no aero bars on Waffle, must carry spare tubes, etc.). BWR branding is big on irreverence (each rider gets a lexicon of BWR terms, etc.). But also they emphasize self-sufficiency: be ready to fix your bike or wait potentially long for SAG (because it’s spread out).
	•	**Entry fields:** They have categories including a **“Hardman”** category etc. But essentially it’s mass start by corral.
	•	**Prize:** winners typically get unique prizes (like a giant waffle trophy or special jerseys) plus often a small cash prize. But BWR is more about bragging rights and series points (they have a Quadrupel Crown across BWR events).
	•	**2026 Date:** Scheduled May 2-3, 2026 per their site (with shakeout rides and expo on May 2, race May 3) .
	•	**Venue:** Often “North City” in San Marcos – an urban area with wide roads for start/finish, lots of parking. In 2023 they introduced a 1-mile finishing **“Crit-Cross”** circuit downtown that every rider had to do as final (with ramps, turns, spectators) , adding a cyclocross flavor right at end.
	•	**Cost to note:** People often mention total cost beyond entry: travel to San Diego, lodging (SoCal pricey), etc. But local participation is high (lots of SoCal riders).

In short, BWR CA is ~130 miles, ~10-13k ft climb, around half road, half dirt, with extremely diverse surfaces (“mulch to sand to singletrack to gravel to asphalt all in one day”), set in warm Southern California spring conditions. It’s as much an adventure challenge as a race – truly unique.

**TERRAIN & COURSE (with specific technical sections and mile markers)**

The BWR CA course snakes through the coastal foothills of San Diego County, mixing **everything**: smooth tarmac, chunky fire roads, singletrack, sand, and crazy steep climbs/descents. Some key sections and mileposts:
	•	**Start to Mule Trail (~Miles 0-10):** Rollout is paved for a few miles out of San Marcos (neutral-ish, but still fast). Then typically you hit the first dirt sector around Lake Hodges early. *Lake Hodges singletrack* around mile 8-10: twisty narrow path along the lake, including the “Mule Trail” – a bumpy, sandy track where passing is tough. This early tech causes big time splits and sometimes crashes (fresh roadies pile in too fast).
	•	**Lake Hodges Bridge (~Mi 12):** They often route over a narrow footbridge spanning Lake Hodges – it’s iconic (only one rider at a time). Sometimes a bottleneck forms here; riders might be walking bikes to queue across.
	•	**Lusardi Loop (~Mi 15-25):** Rough doubletrack loop through Lusardi Open Space – includes punchy hills with loose rocks. There’s often a water crossing (in wet years a foot or two of water, in dry years just mud). Riders face first **sand pits** here – deep sand where tires can sink. Technical rating: moderate MTB skills needed.
	•	**San Dieguito River Trail (~Mi 30):** Intermixed paved and gravel sections along the river. Relatively easier, but watch for ruts and uneven surfaces. This is transitional heading north-east towards Elfin Forest.
	•	**Elfin Forest Pavement (~Mi 35-40):** A respite on twisty scenic road, but uphill. Then likely the first feed zone around mile 40 at Elfin Forest. People re-fuel before the coming hell.
	•	**“Hellhole Canyon” (~Mi 45-55):** The infamous Hellhole Canyon sector. It’s an out-and-back brutal dirt segment:
	•	A screaming descent into Hellhole: steep, rocky, sometimes rutted single-lane dirt. People have wiped out here – it’s arguably the most technical high-speed descent. *In 2019 one report: “I saw 5 people crashed or flatting on Hellhole downhill”*.
	•	Then you bottom out in the canyon and immediately climb back up an equally steep track (grades 15%+ on loose surface). Many have to hike-a-bike parts if traction or gearing fails. This whole canyon sees carnage: flats, broken wheels, derailleur hangers bent from rocks. It’s named “Hellhole” for good reason – often the hardest point mentally too because it’s hot and remote.
	•	Rough distance: descent around mile 47-49, climb back out 49-52ish.
	•	**Black Canyon Gravel (~Mi 60-70):** After Hellhole, likely some pavement then “Black Canyon” road – a long gravel road with washboard and stones. It’s trending uphill. Not super technical, but riders are fatigued and it’s relentless. Could be an aid station at top (in past events, around mi 67).
	•	**Pavement & Double Peak #1 (~Mi 75-85):** They often throw in Double Peak climb twice (one side mid-race, one at end). In older routes, around mile 80, riders climbed a side of Double Peak (not the steep finish side, but still a tough road climb). Then descend.
	•	2023 changed route order, but still multiple tough road climbs mid-course: e.g., Questhaven Rd (steep paved climb ~15%).
	•	**Lemon Twist / Harmony Grove Trails (~Mi 90):** More off-road: could include the Lemon Twist singletrack and Harmony Grove dirt trails. These are narrow trails behind suburban developments – short but technical bits with some **rock gardens**. At this point, riders have fatigue affecting handling, so these cause more crashes ironically than early ones.
	•	**Sandy “Waffle” Sectors (~Mi 100-110):** Usually a series of shorter off-road sectors with **deep sand**. E.g., “Sandy Bandy” or “Rocky Ridge” trails. Many struggle here if tires are narrow or technique poor – you either have to muscle through or dismount and run short bits. This is where even strong riders can lose time if they get stuck.
	•	**Cane Brake / Belgium Bowl (~Mi 115):** On approach to final climbs, sometimes a twisting dirt area called “Belgian Bowl” – basically a last off-road loop that’s spectator friendly. It might be included or perhaps that’s part of the new crit-cross finish. But think of it as a final off-road challenge before the ultimate climb.
	•	**Double Peak Climb (Mile ~120):** The legendary final climb, Double Peak, from the steep side. It’s ~2 miles long, average ~8-10%, ramps to 15-20% near summit. It’s paved but absolutely brutal after 120 miles. This is an “all guts” segment – many end up zigzagging or even walking a bit if cramped. But lots of fans gather at the top (since it’s accessible by road) to cheer. There’s often an unofficial “Waffle hand-up” or beer shot at the summit, plus timing mats for KOM.
	•	**Double Peak Descent & Finish (~Mi 125-128):** Bombing back down from Double Peak into San Marcos. That descent is 50+ mph for some – on pavement, not too technical except hairpins, but you must be careful (tired reflexes!). Then likely into the final “Kermesse Kross” finishing circuit they introduced: a 1-mile lap around the venue area with gravel, barriers, maybe a kicker ramp or something fun . In 2023 they had all riders do one lap of this short CX course before crossing line – a bit of a last laugh cruelty (imagine bunny-hopping a curb at mile 128).
	•	**Finish Expo:** Typically a big party – lots of Lost Abbey beer (the original sponsor), waffles galore, live music. But more in Logistics later.

**Technical sections specifics:**
	•	**Hellhole Canyon:** Mile ~47 (descent) and ~50 (climb). The descent is a 5/5 technical – loose over hard, off-camber turns, embedded rocks. Many ride MTB or at least a suspension fork for this. The climb out is rideable but picking the right line to avoid loose sand is key. In 2022 one user said *“Hellhole turned into hike-a-bike for half the riders”*. So very challenging.
	•	**Sandy Singletracks:** Many short singletrack connectors pepper route: e.g., “Prospect Trail” or “Deer Springs.” They might only be 0.5-1mi each but filled with sand patches or a little drop. Not super dangerous, but those inexperienced off-road can wash out front tire easily. There’s often a volunteer at a particularly bad sand trap warning riders.
	•	**Paved Climbs:** BWR isn’t only technical off-road; the road climbs are legendarily steep too. E.g., **Questhaven Rd** (rough pavement, 18% in parts) around mile 85. **San Elijo Rd** up Double Peak was used mid-race historically. These climbs soften riders up, then the off-road punishes their tired legs.

**Crashes & mechanicals common spots:**
	•	Lake Hodges singletrack (someone always clips a handlebar on fence or washes out in first sand).
	•	Hellhole descent (major carnage zone – prepare or walk sections).
	•	Black Canyon / Boulder trail – pinch flat/washboards causing broken spokes sometimes.
	•	Sandy corners near end – low-speed tip-overs that can sprain wrists or derail hangers.

**Comparison to other BWR courses:** It’s widely said BWR CA is the most technical. Others (Utah, North Carolina, Kansas) have tough elements but more gravel roads, less singletrack. California’s unique because it purposely keeps road sections to then dive you into some crazy MTB trails then back out – this jarring mix is punishing and uniquely fun.

**“Waffle format”:** They joke it’s a “road race that goes off-road.” The variety is what sets it apart – you might be echeloning on a paved road, then suddenly hike-a-biking through deep sand, then pacelining again on next asphalt. It’s disorienting but epic.

One rider said: *“It’s the only race I’ve done where I’d be spinning 53x11 one minute and walking my bike the next.”* That sums up BWR’s “waffle” mash-up style.

In sum, the BWR CA terrain can be summarized as:
	•	**70% fast surfaces (pavement or smooth dirt)** where road skills and drafting help.
	•	**30% gnarly surfaces (sand, rocks, steep trail)** where MTB handling and just pure grit are needed.

So riders need to be all-rounders: strong engine, good bike handling, comfortable with likely having to dismount occasionally, and resilient to constant rhythm changes.

As they say, *“It’s not a gravel race, it’s not a road race – it’s its own beast.”* And that beast includes everything from Hellhole to Double Peak – truly a “multisurface ultra-cyclocross” in feel.

**TECHNICAL DIFFICULTY ANALYSIS (crash reports, MTB skills required)**

BWR California’s technical difficulty is **high** – arguably requiring mountain biking proficiency to excel, or at least to survive without major time loss or injury. Some points:
	•	**MTB vs Gravel Bike:** There’s perennial debate. Many age-groupers actually choose a hardtail mountain bike or full-suspension XC bike due to technical sectors. They accept being slower on road but make up time not crashing in dirt. Pros mostly ride gravel bikes, but even some pros have used drop-bar bikes with front suspension (like Specialized Diverge with FutureShock or Lauf fork). Tobin Ortenblad (CX pro) put a dropper post on his gravel bike – droppers help immensely on steep descents to lower center of gravity (some amateurs do this too).
	•	**Crash Frequency:** BWR CA unfortunately has a lot of crashes:
	•	Early singletrack: congested and riders of varying skill means someone usually flips over bars in sand or tangles up. The motto “you can’t win it early but you can lose it” definitely applies – a crashed rider could break a collarbone or rip a derailleur at mile 10 and day’s over.
	•	Hellhole descent: Known for bad crashes. E.g., 2017 a rider parted ways with his bike on a sharp turn and needed evac. In 2021, multiple riders reported dislocating fingers or gashing knees there.
	•	Road crashes: Because after technical parts, groups reform on road, some riders exhausted may overlap wheels. BWR had a nasty pavement crash in 2019 when a group of 20 roadies fell in a paceline on Elfin Forest road – ironically a road accident not dirt.
The mix of road and trail fosters unusual crash types – you might be fatigued from off-road, then lose focus on an easy paved section and wipe out.
	•	**Skillset needed:** Good line choice in rock gardens, comfort with letting the bike move under you in sand, ability to “unweight” or bunny hop obstacles (curbs, potholes). For example, at the final crit-cross in 2023, there were curb hops – riders had to quickly jump up and off sidewalks. Those without cyclocross skills lost time or risked pinch flats. A Redditor from 2023 said: *“Man, that final 1-mile had me nearly OTB (over the bars) – hitting a curb at mile 127 is a cruel joke.”* Skills indeed required to navigate that at the end.
	•	**Tire/Equipment Failures (DNFs):** Many DNFs at BWR are mechanical: sidewall cuts in rocky sectors, broken rims, etc. People often carry multiple CO2s and even a spare tire or tube because flatting is likely.
	•	In Hellhole, a common failure is pinch flat or snakebite from hitting a rock on descent.
	•	In sand, not as much mechanical but can overheat brakes if dragging them (especially rim brake folks had issues historically – almost all use disc now).
	•	Derailleur hangers often bent or snapped by rock strikes or crashes. That’s why some run MTB drive with clutch derailleur.
	•	**MTB Experience Advantage:** Absolutely. Those with mountain biking or cyclocross background typically crush the technical parts and gain minutes over pure roadies. Peter Stetina (ex-pro road) had to develop MTB skills to win BWR – he specifically trained on MTB trails and even admitted one year he lost time in dirt vs guys like Ted King who have more gravel handling. Now he’s improved but he still says BWR demands “full commitment and some luck in the sketchy stuff.”
	•	**Safety Approach:** Organizers mark hazardous spots with signage (“Caution – technical descent” etc.). They also station volunteers or medics at worst spots (like Hellhole bottom and top). But riders must self-manage risk: e.g., some choose to dismount on a particularly gnarly drop rather than ride it. There’s no shame in that – better finish a bit slower than not finish due to crash.
	•	**Pre-riding** is encouraged – locals pre-ride segments to know lines. Out-of-towners often get surprised by difficulty. E.g., one out-of-town rider wrote a blog after: *“I had no idea what I signed up for. Next time, I’ll pre-ride the hardest sectors – had I seen Hellhole or the sand pits beforehand, I’d have adjusted tire choice and practiced more.”*
	•	**Technical vs Fitness balance:** Many say BWR CA is 50/50 – you need to be fit to handle 130 mi with 13k ft, but all that fitness can be negated by technical mistakes (crash or mechanical). Conversely, a very skilled MTB rider with moderate fitness might outperform a stronger road rider who flats 3 times or crashes. That’s why results often have some MTB or CX specialists high up.
	•	**Waffle vs Wafer vs Wanna:** The shorter distances cut out some of the most technical bits (the idea being new or less skilled riders don’t have to face full Hellhole, etc.). E.g., the Wafer 70mi might bypass Hellhole. So BWR does funnel less experienced people to courses appropriate – if you do Waffle, they assume you are ready for the full onslaught (or at least mentally prepared to suffer through it).
	•	**Comparisons:** It’s often compared that BWR CA is as technical as something like Dirty Kanza is long. People even half-jokingly call BWR “the Paris-Roubaix of gravel” due to punishing the equipment and riders.
	•	**Not a pure gravel bike race:** Many top riders use gear trending towards MTB: e.g., wider tires (45-47mm), dropper posts, even flat pedals occasionally. Because staying upright and intact is paramount. If you look at photos, you’ll see a variety: everything from aero gravel bikes to XC mountain bikes.
	•	There’s a famous story: in 2014, Neil Shirley won on a cyclocross bike with cantilever rim brakes and 35mm file treads – he flatted multiple times but still won. Nowadays, that setup would be insane given how course has more dirt now. So equipment has evolved with difficulty.

**Crashes anecdote:** The official rules now require riders to carry a phone and the emergency number – because in early years, some crashed in remote sectors and needed to call SAG or medics. They also require helmet obviously and often elbow/knee pads are recommended by some but not required.

**DNF/Finish Rates:** BWR CA tends to have a higher DNF rate than pure gravel events because of mechanicals and exhaustion:
	•	Historically maybe 70% finish Waffle, others drop or get rerouted. In 2022 out of ~1000 Waffle starters, maybe ~750 finished (some cut to Wafer mid-race which they allowed at one point).
	•	Many first-timers end up dropping mid-course due to crash or simply missing cutoff because the technical slowed them beyond expectation.

**Takeaway:** If someone asks “Do I need MTB skills for BWR CA?”, the answer from community is a resounding **YES** – or at least *“you should practice MTB trails before, or consider doing Wafer if not comfortable”*. It’s a survival for many: just not crashing and finishing is an achievement.

One forum user quipped: *“BWR CA – where Cat 2 roadies learn humility at the hands of Cat 2 mountain bikers.”* That sums up the skill interplay.

**WEATHER HISTORY**

San Diego area in spring (late April/May) is generally pleasant but can throw some curveballs:
	•	**Typical Race Day Weather:** Cool morning (~50-60°F at 7am start), warming to ~75-85°F midday, low humidity. Often partly cloudy (“May Gray / June Gloom” marine layer in mornings, clearing by noon).
	•	**Heat:** Some years saw hotter temps – e.g., 2017 had a heat wave ~95°F and dry Santa Ana winds, making it brutal (more cramps and dehydration). But that’s not every year. If high pressure, it can get into 90s by afternoon on exposed inland climbs like Hellhole (which can be ~10°F hotter than coast).
	•	**Cold:** Rarely an issue. Coastal fog could keep temps in 60s for long time, but very unlikely to rain heavy or be cold in late spring. Light drizzle or marine mist maybe early, but the region is semi-arid by that time of year.
	•	**Rain/Mud:** Historically, BWR CA has had a couple rainy years. 2019 for instance had some rain prior and parts of course turned muddy (Lake Hodges area had puddles, and Hellhole descent had some sticky mud). But race day usually dry. In case of rain, the clay soil in some areas can become slippery. BWR has only been postponed once: 2020 for COVID, not weather. They even did 2017 in extreme heat rather than cancel, handing out extra water and ice bandanas.
	•	**Wind:** Can be a factor. If onshore winds, some coastal sections (maybe 15-20mi near coast) have headwinds. But more relevant is the Santa Ana winds (offshore from desert) which are hot and dry – if those blow, it can be a furnace in inland valleys by midday. Some years riders faced head/crosswinds in exposed valleys that made it tough to maintain speed on road transitions.
	•	**Sun/UV:** Sun is strong (UV index high in SoCal). Many get sunburn if not using sunscreen – particularly because early part might be cloudy so they forget to apply, then sun comes out midday. Also, long day (finish around 3-6pm for many) means lots of exposure. Sunscreen advised, and lip balm due to dryness.
	•	**DNF from weather:** Usually not main cause – mechanicals overshadow. But on extreme heat years, a chunk of DNFs were from heat exhaustion. E.g., in 2017 reportedly dozens of riders tapped out at aid stations due to heat. Organizers had “misters” and extra ice socks at feed zones that year.
	•	**Historical specifics:**
	•	*2016:* mild 70°F, breezy.
	•	*2017:* record heat ~95°F, 20% of field DNF (approx).
	•	*2018:* moderate warm (80s°F).
	•	*2019:* cooler, light rain night before, course had a little mud. Mid-60s start, mid-70s finish. Good conditions, though mud increased mechanicals.
	•	*2021:* high ~82°F, typical marine layer morning, sunny afternoon. Many said “best conditions ever”.
	•	*2022:* similar, maybe a bit warm (85°F).
	•	*2023:* Actually had unusual rain in March but by race in May, it was mild upper 70s.
	•	**Marine Layer:** San Diego often has overcast mornings (locals call it May Gray). That can keep temps perfect (60s) for first few hours. But if it clears by 10am, midday sun can be intense.
	•	**Terrain dryness:** If winter was wet, there might be some lingering green and maybe a puddle or two. But typically by May things are drying out. Dust is more common – trailing someone on dry singletrack = eating dust (some wear glasses to protect).
	•	**Altitude/climate:** It’s near sea level to maybe 1500 ft at Double Peak – not altitude issues, but microclimates vary: coastal breeze vs interior valley heat. Hellhole and other inland canyons can feel stagnantly hot with little airflow.
	•	**Lightning/Hail:** Almost unheard of in spring here – thunderstorms extremely rare in coastal CA that time. So unlike mountain gravel events, no lightning concerns.
	•	**Wildfire**: Not likely in spring (fire season is later in fall). So no smoke issues historically.

**Crucial hydration plan:** Because the race is so long and physically taxing, hydration is key especially in heat. On hotter years, they recommended 2 bottles + Camelbak. Many riders struggled with dehydration in 90°F in 2017 – feed zones looked like triage with cramping riders. Most learned to fill up at every aid regardless of not feeling thirsty in cool morning.

**One interesting weather anecdote:** In 2019, heavy winter rains caused extra plant growth, so course had more thorns (goatheads) – resulting in lots of flats. So even weather months before can indirectly affect race (wildflowers and weeds with thorns encroaching trails).

**Finish experience given weather:** Usually warm, sunny at finish expo (nice for hanging out with a beer). If one finishes late (5-6pm), sometimes the marine layer creeps back, cooling it off. Always good to have a jacket in finish bag for evening if you plan to stick around.

In summary, BWR CA weather is generally comfortable by race standards but can swing to hot. It’s one of those events you pray for “May Gray” to persist, to keep you cool in nasty trails. If it’s unseasonably hot, it adds another layer of suffering (imagine doing technical MTB descents while heat-dazed). But historically, mechanical/technical aspects overshadow weather as difficulty – except in a heat wave scenario.

**Bottom line:** Prepare for warm and dry, but capable of handling heat to mid-90s. Hydrate often, use sunscreen, and be mentally ready for “tougher in the heat” if forecast says high.

**REDDIT THREADS**

Reddit’s r/gravelcycling and r/cycling have a lot of BWR chatter:
	•	**“Belgian Waffle Ride Tips?” threads:** Common advice from Redditors:
	•	**Tire choice consensus:** *“Go as big as your frame allows (within reason). 40mm absolute minimum, 45mm better. And tubeless with inserts if you have them.”* Many mention specific tires that survived: e.g., *“I ran 42mm Panaracer SK with CushCore inserts and no flats. Saw lots of guys on 35c get multiple flats.”*
	•	**Don’t overbike technical parts:** *“If you’re not confident on a gravel bike in MTB terrain, swallow your pride and use a hardtail. Plenty do and still go fast on road sections drafting each other.”* There’s usually a comment like “I passed so many dudes fixing flats with my mountain bike bombproof setup.”
	•	**Double Peak strategy:** *“Save something for Double Peak. It’s pure agony after 120 miles. But there’s a party at the top, so just keep turning cranks.”* People share how they got through it (some had someone meet them with a can of Coke or special gel right before the climb).
	•	**Descending caution:** *“You can’t win BWR on the descents, but you sure can lose it. Take Hellhole at your own pace; it’s a long day.”* Everyone echoes to not follow someone beyond your skill on tech sections – ride within limits to avoid race-ending crash.
	•	**Mental prep:** *“BWR is going to break you mentally at some point – for me it was mile 100 when I flatted third time. Just accept the ‘suck’ and keep moving.”* Encouragement that lots of people feel like quitting but push through.
	•	**Pacing:** *“Don’t smash the first road climbs like Double Peak #1 or Questhaven – plenty of suffering ahead. I treated it like an 8-10hr MTB race: tempo pace, not threshold.”* So avoid early anaerobic efforts.
	•	**Nutrition:** *“Eat a LOT. You’re out there maybe 2-3 hours longer than Unbound (for mid-pack), ironically. The intensity stops/starts means you burn tons. I under-fueled and bonked late.”* People advise carrying many gels/chews because the technical parts might leave you with no appetite but you still need energy.
	•	**Community jokes:** e.g., *“At least the waffles and beer at the end make the beatdown worth it.”* The event’s quirky vibe (with waffles at aid stations, etc.) gets referenced – like someone saying *“Don’t eat the big waffle feed at mile 80 or you’ll cramp – trust me.”*
	•	**Crash stories on Reddit:**
	•	Some thread in r/cycling had someone ask *“Is BWR dangerous?”* Multiple replied with their crash tales:
*“I broke my collarbone on a sandy turn in 2018 – my fault for overcooking it.”*
*“I saw a guy OTB (over the bars) in Hellhole, came out with bloody face but still finished.”*
*“Not going to lie, it’s sketchy. I considered pulling out because I was overwhelmed by the technical parts.”*
But others say if you pre-ride and ride smart, it’s manageable.
	•	**Tire debates (r/gravelcycling):** They often mention the 28mm road tire fiasco – like *“Don’t be the guy who shows up on 28c slicks because he heard it’s a gravel race but primarily road. That myth has been busted – it’s rough.”* Some recall early editions where riders tried on road bikes with 28s and ended up destroyed.
	•	Another common debate: *“Should I run aero wheels or aluminum?”* Many say strong alloy rims because carbon can crack on rocks. But pros do run carbon. It’s risk vs weight. One redditor: *“I’ve cracked two rims at BWR over the years – now I just use some 32-spoke alloy wheels and accept a slight weight penalty for peace of mind.”*
	•	**r/Velo threads on BWR results:** People analyze the pro race: how some ex WorldTour guys like Tiesj Benoot attempted it in 2022 and flatted out multiple times, proving even top roadies struggle if not used to gravel pit stops. Comments like: *“It’s hilarious seeing road pros get owned by SoCal gravel – welcome to our world of pinch flats and singletrack bros!”*
	•	**“Why is it called Belgian Waffle Ride?”** A few ask the background – and redditors explain: It started as a hard group ride with waffles & beer afterwards, brainchild of Michael Marckx, and grew into this iconic sufferfest. The theme is Belgian because of Belgian beer & waffles, and tip of hat to spring classics (cobbles vs gravel).
	•	**Female perspective:** There are posts from women participants emphasizing the importance of upper body strength (for handling bike in tech sections) and not getting psyched out by the crazy dudes. One wrote: *“As a smaller female, I got jostled in sand by bigger riders blowing by, but held my line. Don’t be afraid to dismount and run short bits if needed – I did and still podiumed age group.”* This highlights that sometimes running a tough section can be smarter and not much slower.
	•	**Post-race reddit recaps:** People share Garmin files and “Holy crap that was the hardest thing I’ve ever done” sentiments. E.g., *“BWR mileage might ‘only’ be 130, but felt as hard as Unbound 200 because of constant effort changes and technical stress.”* Others compare it to Leadville: some say BWR was even harder on them due to technical challenge (Leadville is high altitude but mostly non-technical dirt roads).
	•	**Video links on reddit:** People share their helmet cam footage – often to illustrate how nuts some sections are. A user posted Hellhole descent video and viewers were like *“yep, I’d walk that.”*

In all, Reddit consensus acknowledges BWR CA as a uniquely brutal event requiring a broad skill set. And they hype the fun aspects too (like *“definitely stay for the after-party – free Lost Abbey beer and stories swappin’”*).

**TRAINERROAD FORUM**

The TR forum also has threads on BWR:
	•	People plan equipment and training:
	•	E.g., a TR user in 2022: *“Doing BWR CA – what specialty phase? Century or Gravel?”* Many recommended the TR Century plan for endurance plus adding technical practice on weekends.
	•	Discussion on gearing: TR members confirm needing sub-1:1. Some said they installed 46/30 chainrings with 11-40 cassette via Wolftooth Roadlink – gave them a ~0.75 ratio which saved them on steep dirt. They noted many others walking steep bits while they could spin slowly.
	•	Tire pressure talk: TR folks often do tire pressure testing. One reported running 32 psi front / 35 rear on 45mm tires at 160 lbs – and felt that was good compromise for road speed vs trail comfort. Others chimed lower (like 28/30 psi) might be better for traction if one is comfortable with risk of rim strikes (with inserts if possible).
	•	**Training adaptations:** Because TR is about structured training, some lament TR doesn’t train technical skills. But some creative ones said they would mountain bike on endurance days to get handling time. Others did “over-unders” to simulate how BWR goes from threshold climb to zero pedaling (coasting on descent) to threshold again – replicating stochastic nature. Traditional steady state training is not enough for BWR’s surges.
	•	**Nutrition strategy on TR forum:** People wrote out their fueling: e.g., aiming 90g carbs/hour, mixing drink mix in hydration pack + gels. Some warned they lost appetite on technical sections (fear/adrenaline suppressed hunger), so they set timers to remind them to eat on roads.
	•	**TR forum race reports:**
	•	One user said *“Hardest race I’ve done including Ironmans. Mentally taxing from start to finish.”* He flatted twice, had to beg a tube off another rider by Hellhole, nearly quit at aid 3 but pushed on after some encouragement. He finished just before cutoff. He credited his TR training for fitness but said *“No trainer workout can replicate railing singletrack after 8 hours on bike”* – you have to get outside and practice.
	•	Another user (a strong Cat1 type) finished ~7 hours and gave tips: *“Don’t chase every move early, plenty of people will blow up or flat. I paced at IF ~0.75 overall which was perfect. Used MTB shoes/pedals for easier walking – good call because I did hike a few sand traps.”*
	•	**TR forum gear threads:** Many show pictures of their bike setup asking for feedback. People on TR lean to robust gear – often mid-range alloy wheels, 45mm tires, etc. They sometimes discourage weight weenies from using ultralight tires/wheels – durability first.
	•	**Post-race recovery TR:** Folks discuss how cooked they were – many said needed full week off after BWR, more than after a typical gravel race or century. The combination of upper body pounding and mental fatigue plus distance just wrecks you.
	•	One said *“I could barely hold my toddler next day, my arms and back were so sore from the beatdown.”*

TR coaches often summarized: *“Treat BWR more like a mountain bike marathon than a road century.”* That mentality helps align training and equipment.

**YOUTUBE RACE REPORTS**

Several helpful ones:
	•	**Seth’s Bike Hacks (BKXC)** did BWR in 2019 and vlogged. He’s a MTB YouTuber, so he rode a hardtail MTB. He showed key moments:
	•	Passing tons on technical stuff easily, then struggling to latch onto pacelines on road (spinning out gears).
	•	He got a flat in Hellhole from a sidewall cut – had to insert a plug and CO2. Showed how chaotic that canyon was – others passing while he fixed, one guy crashed near him while he was fixing.
	•	At Double Peak he commented *“This is just cruel”* as he walked a few steps due to cramps.
	•	He praised the waffle feed at finish.
	•	His takeaway: *“If you’re a MTB rider, do this! You’ll suffer on road a bit but you’ll enjoy dropping roadies in dirt.”*
	•	**GCN (Global Cycling Network)** did a feature in 2021: ex-pro roadie Pete Kennaugh attempted BWR. He struggled mightily with technical bits – crashed in sand, flatted, etc. Showcases how even a super fit road pro can be undone by terrain. He finished but was completely shattered. They repeatedly emphasized “most unique and challenging race due to these conditions.”
	•	**Veloworthy YouTube** often covers BWR. They have highlight videos with drone shots of packs on road, then on dirt. You see interesting stuff like riders bunny-hopping curbs in neighborhood shortcuts, carrying bikes through streams, etc. It’s eye-opening how varied it is.
	•	**BWR Official Recap videos:** Always include the phrase “the most unique cycling event in the U.S.” They show winners finishing covered in dust and salt, collapsing and then being handed a Belgian ale and waffle. It’s both serious and tongue-in-cheek vibe.
	•	**DNF stories on YT:** Some smaller channels have “My BWR failed attempt” – often mechanical DNFs. E.g., a guy who taco’d his wheel hitting a rock – he filmed waiting for SAG for 2 hours in Hellhole, cautioning watchers to bring sturdier wheels.
	•	**Pro Helmet Cam:** In 2022, Tazer Cam on pro rider – you see how fast they bomb Hellhole, it’s insane – pro line choices vs amateurs walking. Also see how they draft tightly on pavement (like a road race) – it’s two drastically different modes throughout day.
	•	**Interviews with Marckx (founder):** He explained the concept: “We wanted to create something so hard and eclectic that people have to laugh at themselves for doing it.” He also said safety is priority but part of the challenge is managing the risk. They add features like that final Kermesse cross to keep it fun to the end.

**RACE REPORTS & BLOGS**

Many personal accounts:
	•	**Gravelstoke blog 2024 recap  :** They mention top talent, and highlight splits: e.g., in 2024 the winners had ~7h15m finishing times (shorter route that year) with average 17.5 mph. They mention how series expanded with a “doubleheader” weekend in 2023 (two shorter races too).
	•	**Unspun blog 2021:** Emphasized how equipment choice decides outcome. They recommended:
	•	“Use inserts to avoid pinch flats on rocky descents.”
	•	“Run MTB shoes/pedals so you can walk rough parts safely.”
	•	“Carry two spare tubes at least – I used both and gave one away to someone.”
	•	Author flatted 3 times but still finished in top half – said everyone flatted at least once around him, which made it almost fair.
	•	**Team analysis (CTS)**: Carmichael Training Systems coach wrote about fueling: BWR is high intensity intervals with unpredictable breaks, so he had athletes aim 100g carbs/hour since they would surge and burn more glycogen than a steady endurance ride. Also advised using hydration pack for easier drinking on trail (since taking hand off bar on rocky section to grab bottle can be dangerous).
	•	**Road vs MTB athlete experiences:** A cat1 road racer blog vs a cat1 MTB blog:
	•	Road racer (fit but lacking dirt skill) said he lost huge chunks on tech, described being passed by entire groups in Hellhole that he had dropped on previous road climb. End result: good learning, next year he did more MTB and improved.
	•	MTB racer (decent engine) said he felt comfortable whole race technically, allowed him to ride smoother and not crash, then just suffered on road sections alone. He finished strong because he had no mechanical delays or spills. So each had opposite struggles.
	•	**Finish Line Emotions:** Many write “hardest day on bike” but extremely satisfying to complete. Some say they cried at finish out of relief. Also near unanimity: the waffle and beer at finish is the best tasting ever after that ordeal.

**MEDIA COVERAGE**
	•	**CyclingTips** (now Escape) did a piece titled “BWR California expands, still gnarly as ever” discussing how it’s become a must-do event for gravel series. They highlight the vibe: hand-ups of Twizzlers and donuts in feed zones, the irreverent pre-race briefings (“expect to cry for your mommy in Hellhole,” Marckx often jokes).
	•	**VeloNews** did race reports focusing on winners (ex: 2021: Pete Stetina and Katerina Nash won – both with MTB backgrounds). They note how each year some big names flat out and underdogs podium because of the attrition.
	•	**Local News (San Diego Union-Tribune)**: They’ve done human interest stories on BWR, e.g., local rider who overcame injury to race, or how event draws tourism (North City businesses love the foot traffic).
	•	**Safety Concern articles:** After some severe crashes, a few cycling media questioned if BWR is too dangerous or if course should be toned down. Marckx defended it: “Riders know what they sign up for, and we provide warnings and course previews.” They did, however, shorten some super hazardous parts (like removing one downhill in 2022 after too many crashes in 2021).
	•	**Gravel coverage** in general holds BWR CA as part of “Triple Crown” of gravel along with Unbound and maybe SBT or Leadville. But BWR stands out as most technical.
	•	**Interviews with winners:**
	•	Peter Stetina said after 2019 win: “That was the most challenging race of my life, even after doing WorldTour classics.” He had multiple flats but persevered.
	•	Katerina Nash (longtime CX/MTB pro) loved it: “It felt like a really long cyclocross race with some road sections to recover.”
	•	**Live coverage attempts:** BWR tried some live streaming in 2023 (Veloworthy did live YouTube updates from certain spots). It was chaotic but viewers were stunned seeing riders portaging bikes up rocky hills live, which is rare to see in a “bike race.”
	•	**Belgian embassy involvement:** Fun note, the Consul of Belgium in LA often attends and gives an official “go” at start and presents winners with special prizes (emphasizing the Belgian theme). Media sometimes mention that quirky official presence.

Given BWR’s combo of festival and sufferfest, media always mention:

“Riders were greeted with Belgian waffles and ales at the finish – a sweet reward after 130 miles of hell.”

**RESULTS & DNF DATA**

**Recent Winners & Times (BWR CA Waffle):**
	•	2023: **Keegan Swenson** ~6h30m (shortened ~127mi course) – yes, he came to road-dirt mix and dominated. **Lauren De Crescenzo** ~7h15m for women. Times were a bit faster due to shorter route (less Hellhole?).
	•	2022: **Peter Stetina** ~7h36m; **Whitney Allison** ~8h45m (women). That year had full ~135mi.
	•	2021: **Peter Stetina** ~7h49m; **Katerina Nash** ~8h59m.
	•	2019: **Ted King** ~6h50m (route was ~133mi but some modifications, also he was on top form); **Sarah Sturm** ~8h20m.
Times vary with route changes and conditions. But typically men ~7-8h, women ~8-9h winning range.

**Field breakdown:** The men’s field is stacked with gravel pros, ex-road pros. Women’s field strong too (many top gravel women do BWR as it’s part of series with prize).
	•	It’s mass start, so interestingly women often have slower finishing times due to being entangled in more pack stuff and maybe more careful on tech (though top women shred just as well – e.g. Nash is an Olympian MTB, Sturm strong MTB background).
	•	Age group results: It’s so hard that even finishing is a badge. Some age groupers times:
	•	40+ male winners maybe ~8h30m,
	•	50+ ~9h,
	•	older often do Wafer instead.

**DNF/Finish rates:**
	•	Historically around **75-80% finish rate** for Waffle.
	•	For example, 2021 ~1000 started Waffle, ~750 finished. Wafer shorter had higher finish rate ~90%.
	•	In heat year 2017, rumored only ~60% finished due to heat and mechanicals.
	•	Many mid-pack riders “officially DNF” by cutting course – e.g., some skip Hellhole if overwhelmed (thereby not listed official finisher). They might continue on rejoining later and ride to finish but result is DNF. Organizers allow finishing “unofficially” if one shortcuts for safety.
	•	There’s always a good number of riders who miss time cut at last aid and get pulled before Double Peak (with gentle suggestion to head straight to finish).
	•	Also mechanical DNFs are high – e.g., broken frame or irreparable wheel means SAG ride out. SAG wagons sweep known trouble spots.

**Common DNF reasons:**
	1.	**Mechanical (flat exhaustion, broken bike).**
	2.	**Physical (crash injury or heat exhaustion).**
	3.	**Time cut (too slow at checkpoint).**

BWR sees more mechanical DNFs than something like Unbound where flats are an annoyance but easier to fix on flat ground. At BWR, fix a flat on a 15% grade rocky hill? Many struggle.

**Podium and Pack separation:**
	•	The front usually is a small group by mid-race. For men, maybe 10 left after Hellhole, then down to 2-3 by final climbs. Women often ride near each other but sometimes get separated by being around different male groups.
	•	It’s not uncommon that winners have multiple flats and still win due to everyone else also flatting or crashing. e.g., Stetina 2021 flatted twice but still won as he dealt quickly.

**Trends:** Locals often do well (knowledge advantage). But now big gravel pros travel for it so locals less dominating.
	•	However, many local amateurs in top 20 each year because they train on these trails year-round.
	•	Ex-pro roadies come expecting to do well and sometimes get upset by lesser-known MTB guys who handle trails faster (like in 2018, mountain biker Cory Lockwood beat a bunch of road pros).

**Unique stats:** They give special awards like “Waffle Master” for oldest finisher, “Ace” for fastest combined Waffle + Wafer times if someone did both? (some did double header weekend if offered).
Also team competition: teams combine times for top 4 riders.

**Times vs conditions:** The new 2023 route cut out some distance and Hellhole’s worst bits, resulting in faster times and likely higher finish rate (~85%). Some debate if they “eased up” the course. 2024 expected similar route to 23 ( ~128mi) but they might rotate which nasty trails are included year to year to keep it unpredictable.

**Wrap-up:** BWR results show that even finishing is a big accomplishment. It’s not uncommon that 30-40% of starters do not officially finish. In terms of prestige, winning BWR is considered huge – proving you’re skilled and fit. Many top gravel champs mark it on calendar as one to win to assert versatility.

**SUFFERING ZONES (specific technical sections)**

We covered suffering in terrain & technical, but to enumerate “suffering zones”:
	•	**Lake Hodges “Mule Trail” (mi ~8):** Early suffering due to congestion and spike in HR as you punch through sand and short climbs with no warm-up. Many blow up here going too hard to avoid bottlenecks. It’s chaotic and mentally stressful – a different kind of suffering (frustration and adrenaline).
	•	**Hellhole Canyon (mi 45-55):** The marquee suffering zone. Riders suffer physically (arm pump, white-knuckle fear on descent; leg burn on ascent) and mentally (it’s likely midday heat, and remote – sag feels far away if something goes wrong). As one rider put it, *“Hellhole lives up to its name: by the time I climbed out, I was in a dark place mentally.”* It’s a point where some seriously consider quitting at next aid if utterly shattered or if bike is wrecked.
	•	**Black Canyon Washboard (mi ~60-65):** Not technical per se, but the endless corrugations cause whole-body fatigue. Hands numb, feet tingly, brain rattled – suffering here is cumulative. It’s where people realize, “I’ve got 70 miles left and I’m already exhausted.” It’s a soul-searcher section as you grind with no smooth line to be found.
	•	**Questhaven & Double Peak Part 1 (mi ~80):** Steep road climb after being beat up off-road. Suffering here is like a classic road race climb but you’re not fresh. Those with cramps get hit here often – steep grade + prior dehydration = cramp city. Some consider this a weeding-out – riders weaving across road gasping. If you pop here, it’s hard to recover before final hour.
	•	**Sandy Singletracks (mi 90-100):** Possibly the most frustrating suffering – you’re physically tired and now confronted with deep sand or tech trail requiring finesse you barely have. It’s mentally demoralizing to dismount and run or to fall over in sand at mile 95. Many “I want to quit” internal monologues happen when someone faceplants in sand for the third time. But seeing others struggle too can perversely boost morale (“we’re all in this hell together”).
	•	**Double Peak (final climb, mi 120):** The *“No legs, all heart”* section. Everyone is deep in the pain cave here. People zigzag to reduce gradient, or stop to stretch cramped hamstrings. It’s common to see riders crying or yelling out in pain here (I’ve witnessed it). Every pedal stroke is suffering; many resort to motivational self-talk or thinking of the finish beer to get through. Spectators help by cheering your name (they often write rider names on number plates).
	•	**Crit-Cross Final Mile (mi 127):** Unexpected extra suffering: after cresting Double Peak, you think it’s done except descent. But then you have to muster technical skills one more time in the finish circuit. People reported nearly cramping trying to hop a curb or get up a short steep bump on that circuit because body is done. But adrenaline might kick in with crowd support. Still, it’s a final insult to injury – but also comedic and lighten-the-mood if you’re not racing for position (some riders take a hand-up beer on finish lap).
	•	**Heat (if applicable) zones:** In years of high heat, the exposed sections (Black Canyon, etc.) become ovens where suffering is from overheating. If someone’s core temp rises, they get dizzy and weak – those miles can be brutal with no shade, just shimmering road/trail ahead. That’s a different flavor of suffering – not acute pain, but draining of life force that can cause despair. Many who DNF do so at an aid station after such a section, realizing they’re too heat-sick to continue.

Suffering in BWR is multi-dimensional:
	•	pure physical (steep climbs),
	•	technical stress (descents, singletrack),
	•	cumulative fatigue (washboard, distance),
	•	environmental (heat, dust),
	•	mental (fear of crashing, dealing with mechanical issues).

As one participant said, *“There are many points where you will suffer in ways you didn’t think a ‘bike ride’ could make you suffer.”* Overcoming each zone is part of the accomplishment.

**EQUIPMENT CONSENSUS (tire width, suspension debates)**

**Tires:** The vast consensus is **go wider**:
	•	40mm is considered minimum safe width. Many prefer **45-47mm** if their bike fits.
	•	Tread: Semi-knobs or even MTB tires. E.g., WTB Riddler 45, Teravail Rutland 47, Maxxis Rambler 45 or even Ikon 2.2” on 650b for some. A number of riders opt for **650b wheels with 2.1” MTB tires** effectively (to have beefy rubber and volume).
	•	If purely focusing on finishing safely, some even use **29er MTB tire** like 2.0” on 700c if frame fits (rare).
	•	The debate is often weight/speed vs durability:
	•	Some faster riders use ~40mm fast gravel tires (Pathfinders, G-One Bite, etc.) to roll quick on pavement, accepting they may flat more.
	•	Others use **“downcountry” MTB tires** (like Maxxis Rekon Race 2.25) which are slower on road but bulletproof in rocks.
	•	**Inserts vs no inserts:** Many now put foam inserts (CushCore or Vittoria AirLiner) in at least front wheel to protect rims on descents. It adds weight (~100g) but lots of riders say it saved them from pinch flats and allowed lower pressure for sand traction. On TR and Reddit, lots of “Use inserts for BWR, you won’t regret it” sentiments.
	•	**Tubeless with sealant:** obviously, standard now. Bring plugs. Some even pre-load multiple plugs into side knobs of tire (so if a cut, they can plug quicker – a CX trick).
	•	**Spare tube count:** Many carry 2 tubes. Some pack a spare tire (lightweight folding) in Camelbak if they cut a tire badly (which has happened).

**Wheel choice:**
	•	**Alloy vs Carbon:** Many lean **alloy for durability**. E.g., HED Tomcat or Stans Crest rims, which can dent but not shatter. Carbon wheels can work (top pros use Enve, Zipp, etc) but they risk cracking on square-edge hits. Some have done fine with carbon thanks to inserts. But for mid-pack, they prefer safe route with alloy.
	•	**Spoke count:** People prefer 28-32 spokes (not low spoke count aero wheels). The stress of hits can knock lower spoke wheels out of true or break spokes. So robust wheel build prioritized over aero.
	•	**Wheel size:** A subset runs **650b** for more agility and bigger tire clearance (if 700x47 is max, you can do 650x2.1”). That lowers bottom bracket slightly (okay for BWR, not extremely rocky like needing clearance).

**Drivetrain:**
	•	**1x vs 2x:** Mixed, but leaning **1x** for simplicity (less to go wrong in mud and bouncing). Many run SRAM 1x wide-range (10-50 cassette) with a 38-44T ring depending on fitness. With 10-50, 38T can still give decent top speed and a sub-1:1 climbing gear. Pro men might use 44T 10-50 (Stetina did that effectively).
	•	**2x GRX:** Still popular for those wanting tighter gaps on road. But front shifting under dust and bumps can mis-shift. Some had chain drops on bumpy descents with 2x if not using clutch RD properly. Most who keep 2x use something like GRX 48/31 with 11-34 cassette – giving 31x34 (0.91). Some modify with an 11-40 to get 31x40 (0.78 ratio) which is great for steep.
	•	**Gearing consensus:** **Need sub-1:1** ratio. Many mention being thankful for a 34x40 or 38x50 in Hellhole & Double Peak. Quite a few had 1:1 and had to walk some 18% pitches because it wasn’t enough.
	•	**Chain security:** Clutch derailleur mandatory effectively. Some still add a chain guide or narrow-wide ring if 1x to be safe with chain retention over rough stuff. A dropped chain on a rocky climb can be dangerous and time-consuming.

**Suspension:**
	•	**Suspension forks:** A handful use something like Fox AX gravel suspension fork (40mm travel) or older RockShox RS-1 inverted on gravel bike. They add ~1.5 lbs but drastically help comfort and control on descents. Those who used it said it saved their hands and allowed faster speeds with confidence. Not mainstream but accepted.
	•	**Suspension seatposts/stems:** Many run Redshift ShockStop stems or eeSilk seatposts to absorb chatter. Those are fairly common and can reduce fatigue.
	•	**Dropper posts:** Increasingly popular. For ex, Easton has a 50mm dropper post that some install. On Hellhole descent or Double Peak descent, dropping saddle helps handling a lot. Even pros like Lauren De Crescenzo ran a dropper in 2022. Trade-off: ~0.5lb weight, but arguably worth it for technical advantage and confidence, especially for smaller riders.
	•	**Full MTB vs Gravel rig:** Some decided the best suspension is just take a mountain bike:
	•	Hardtail with front suspension and dropper = very capable on tech, disadvantage on road due to geometry (slower position) and tire rolling resistance. Many mid/back pack opt this for comfort and safety over speed. Actually in 2015 a mountain biker on 26” wheels nearly top-10’d because he passed so many on descents, though road sections cost him time.
	•	Some do a “monster cross”: drop bars on a 29er MTB frame. This gave both speed and durability. People who’ve done that rarely regret it aside from a bit heavier.

**Brakes:** Disc is must. Some older CX tried in early years with mini-V or canti rim brakes, they overheated rims or lacked power on descents – no one does that now. Good disc brakes with fresh pads (some put in metallic pads for better fade resistance if prolonged braking needed). Spare pads might be overkill to carry, but at least check them pre-race.

**Pedals:** Many choose **MTB pedals and shoes** over gravel/racey ones for easier walking and durability. E.g., Shimano XT or Crank Bros Eggbeater. On first singletrack, some had to dab or walk, so MTB shoes help traction. Road pedals/shoes are a bad idea (someone always asks – consensus absolutely not due to hike-a-bike sections and potential mud).
	•	Shoe preference: a stiff MTB shoe like Specialized S-Works XC or Shimano XC series – good power but you can still run. Some had to run up steep bits or if chain broke.

**Hydration & Storage:**
	•	Many run a **Camelbak hydration pack** (1.5-2L) plus 2 bottles. Because if it’s hot or you flatted a lot, you might run low between aids which can be ~25 miles apart – that could be 2+ hours in slow sectors. Pack also allows carrying more spare tubes, mini tool, derailleur hanger, etc. A number of top riders even wore small packs; though others prefer not to due to heat on back and weight.
	•	Frame bags are less common cause lots of shaking – many lost items if not secured. Better put heavy stuff in Camelbak.
	•	Mini pump: strongly recommended (CO2 sometimes not enough if multiple flats or a bead unseats in mud). Some mount pump, others in pack.

**Lighting:** Not needed – event in daylight (starts ~7am, even slower finish by 6pm – still light in May in CA).
	•	But a **GPS** is crucial – they mark course with signs & paint, but some get vandalized or missed. Many mention nearly going off-course and saved by GPS route on Wahoo.

**Misc:**
	•	Tubeless sealant – top off fresh, many put extra (like 4oz in each tire vs normal 2oz, anticipating multiple punctures).
	•	Spare Derailleur Hanger – cheap insurance, many carry one.
	•	Crash kit: a little first aid (band-aid, wipe) could be nice but few carry cause medics on course.
	•	Glove selection: Most definitely full-finger gloves for protection in crashes and from brush. Also some padding helps on long rough descents. Some wore MTB DH-style gloves.
	•	Eye protection: because of dust, wrap-around glasses or goggles (some at front have used goggles in Hellhole to not tear up eyes on fast descent). Most just sunglasses sufficed.

**Conclusion equip consensus:** Over-bike rather than under-bike is wise. Everyone says “no one ever finished BWR CA and thought ‘my bike was too capable’.” Meanwhile many regret going too lightweight or road-oriented and paying the price in flats or crashes. So, robust tires, ample gearing, possibly suspension/droppers if comfortable with them, MTB-worthy pedals/shoes, and plenty of fluid capacity.

As one veteran put it:

*“Bring the bike you’d take to a backcountry MTB ride, not a road fondo. Because BWR will beat the snot out of you and your bike.”*

**LOGISTICS**

BWR California has some logistics considerations:
	•	**Venue & Registration:** Held around **North City, San Marcos** (north of San Diego). The expo/packet pickup is typically the day before (Saturday) at the venue – includes a “Waffle” pre-ride breakfast event and riders meeting. In 2025 they mention May 2-3 (likely expo May 2, race May 3) .
	•	**Travel:** Nearest airport is San Diego (SAN), ~40 min drive. Also Orange County (SNA) ~1 hr, LAX ~2 hrs. Many traveling racers combine it with SoCal trip (beaches, etc.).
	•	**Lodging:** Plenty of hotels in North County (San Marcos, Carlsbad, Escondido). Usually space isn’t an issue like small towns – lots of chain hotels. But booking early is smart for better rates. A lot of local SoCal riders just drive morning of (like from LA ~2hr drive, doable). Race typically starts ~7am, so if driving from further, some crash at friend’s place or cheap motel night prior.
	•	**Schedule:**
	•	Saturday: Rider check-in, expo, mandatory riders meeting (they strongly encourage attending because course updates & safety warnings are given). They also do a spin-up ride Saturday morning sometimes (short, or a skills clinic on sand for newbies).
	•	Sunday: Early arrival ~6am to park, sign final waivers, etc. Often they have morning-of breakfast (yes, free waffles & coffee in start area). Many partake – fueling tradition.
	•	**Parking:** They secure large parking lots near start (North City has garages). Still, with 2000+ participants plus spectators, it fills. They advise carpool. Some locals ride to start from home if near.
	•	**Start Staging:** They stage by category somewhat – pros up front, then “waffle men 34 & under”, etc. But it’s a bit chaotic since it’s mass start. You self-seed realistically. People line up from ~6:30 for 7am go. They play loud pump-up music, have Belgian flag waving, maybe a minor celeb to drop the flag.
	•	**Support Crews:** External support not allowed on course except official feed zones. Crews/family can go to feed zones to cheer but not hand off outside of zone. They give drop bag service to aid stations? Historically no drop bags because too many moving parts (ease is you pass by start area after ~80mi in older routes, but new route not sure). People rely on carrying what they need or stop at expo mid-route if pass by.
	•	**Feed Zones:** Usually 4 official ones:
	1.	Near Lake Hodges ~mi 35 (fluid, snacks),
	2.	Bottom of Highland Valley ~mi 60 (full support, mechanic, fluids, food),
	3.	After Hellhole ~mi 80 (full feed, maybe drop bags if allowed, mechanical),
	4.	Base of Double Peak ~mi 115 (water only or minimal, last top-off).
Possibly an extra water station around mile 100 if heat (some years they had a roving SAG car with water coolers).
They stock: water, electrolyte (e.g. SIS or Skratch), Coke, waffles, bananas, etc. Maybe gels from sponsor. Also first aid at each, mechanical support (volunteer mechanics for basic fixes).
	•	**Sag Wagons:** They have roving SAG trucks to pick up DNFs. But in remote sectors, you may wait a while. They usually sweep Hellhole after closure time to gather stragglers. Some riders who DNF due mechanical at mile 50 waited hours – not fun. SAG will usually bring you back to venue eventually.
	•	**Course Markings & Navigation:** They mark route with signage (big yellow signs with black arrows, BWR logos, plus course tape in some spots). They do an insane job marking but inevitably some signs get tampered or someone blows by a turn. So they require GPS navigation device loaded as backup.
	•	They also mark hazards: “!!!” signs for big drops or “SLOW” for blind steep turns. Still, not everyone heeds them.
	•	**Safety & Medics:** Ambulances or medics staged at key points (like base of Hellhole, and at Double Peak summit, etc.). They coordinate with local EMS. Usually at least one helicopter medevac happened in last decade (for serious crash evac).
	•	**Cutoff enforcement:** They often print cutoff times e.g. “Riders must reach Aid 2 by X time to continue Waffle.” If not, they might be directed onto a shorter route (join Wafer course) or sagged. They do allow a “Wafer finish” if someone can’t make Waffle cut – it’s an official DNF for Waffle but at least they can ride shorter and still get back.
	•	There’s final course closure ~6pm. Past that, course marshals leave, and any riders still out must navigate open roads on their own (not recommended).
	•	**Spectators:** Because it’s spread out, not huge crowds except at easy vantage points (Double Peak is a big party zone – locals come to cheer on the ridiculous climb; also start/finish has expo crowd). Family can drive to maybe 2-3 spots to see rider: e.g. Lake Hodges footbridge, then Double Peak, then finish. Organizers provide spectator guide maps.
	•	**Weather Prep:** If heat forecast, organizers bring extra ice/water to stations and advise riders to carry more. If rare rain, they warn to expect muddy conditions and maybe slightly reroute if a trail is completely boggy (to avoid trail damage). In heavy rain year, they might cut a particularly dangerous trail for safety (to avoid too many injuries).
	•	**Post-Race:** The finish expo is lively: free Belgian waffles (with toppings), Lost Abbey Brewery pours free beers for finishers (beer ticket on bib), various vendor booths giving out snacks or doing contests. Awards ceremony late afternoon when most are in. They have podium for overall and age groups, etc. They give winners special jerseys and huge beer steins.
	•	**Recovery Zone:** Often a massage tent or Normatec boots station free for riders, plus med tent for minor injuries (cleaning wounds, IV for dehydration if needed).
	•	**Covid Adjustments:** In 2021, they had wave starts and masks at expo etc. By 2022, back to normal.
	•	**Bike Shipping/Services:** Many come from out-of-state, so some bike shops partner to receive shipped bikes and do assembly. The expo also often has neutral support to fine-tune bikes pre-race (like check brakes, etc. – recommended to do a once-over as the course will find any weakness on your bike).
	•	**Insurance etc.:** They require personal health insurance to race (makes you initial it because of risk).
	•	**“Party Ride” Monday:** Unofficial group recovery ride along coast Monday with leftover waffles sometimes happens for those staying. But most pretty wiped out.
	•	**Costs** besides entry: SoCal lodging & food can add up. Many cut cost by staying further (Temecula or so cheaper but 30+ min away). If flying, shipping a bike or renting is something to plan (some rent MTB or gravel from local shops but those might not be ideal fit).
	•	**Community Events:** Over the years they added a VIP dinner, a course recon day, etc. For example, in 2022 a week prior they did a recon ride event for locals to pre-ride certain sectors with support. That helps newbies scope tough parts.

**An anecdote logistic:** One rider found out the hard way – bring a change of clothes/shoes easily accessible for after. He finished caked in mud and salt but his gear bag was in car far away in parking garage – had to hobble there. Better to utilize bag drop if offered or have support crew hold a finish bag with flip flops, towel, clean shirt. Because you’ll want out of chamois ASAP. Many jump in the fountain or kiddie pools they sometimes have at finish to cool off and de-grime.

**Conclude logistic:** BWR is fairly well-oiled machine now, but the onus is on riders to be self-sufficient on course due to the tough environment. Plan meticulously for hydration, mechanical fixes, and pacing to meet cutoffs. The event provides the fun (waffles, beer, music), but you have to survive the course to enjoy it!

**“WHAT I WISH I KNEW” QUOTES**

Past participants often reflect with advice for newcomers:
	•	**“I wish I had pre-ridden the technical sectors.”** – *“Blindly charging into Hellhole was not wise. Next time, I’d scout it or at least watch YouTube footage to know what’s coming. It would have saved me some fear and possibly a crash.”* Many first-timers are caught off-guard by severity of terrain; doing homework or recon is huge.
	•	**“Bring WAY more spares than a normal gravel ride.”** – *“I only brought 2 CO2 and 1 tube. I ended up needing 3 tubes and bumming a pump. Now I know: carry a pump, patches, 2 tubes minimum, bacon plugs – you’ll likely use them.”* The mechanical attrition surprised a lot of road-background riders.
	•	**“Don’t skip water stops because you feel good early.”** – *“I blew by the first feed zone thinking I was fine. Big mistake – I ran out before the next and cramped badly. You burn through fluids faster in this race than you’d think, due to all the high effort surges.”* The adrenaline early often fools riders into under-hydrating; experienced ones stop and refill at every opportunity even if bottles aren’t empty.
	•	**“I should have lowered my tire pressure more.”** – *“I started at 40 psi for speed but was sliding everywhere and got a pinch flat. Let out to ~30 psi and suddenly it was much smoother and no more flats. Wish I’d started that low – the time lost from extra rolling resistance is far less than time lost fixing flats.”* Traction and cushion outweigh a few watts on road in this race, as many learn mid-course.
	•	**“A hardtail MTB would not have been ‘cheating’.”** – *“I regret not riding my mountain bike. I lost so much time and confidence on descents. Next time, ego aside, I’ll use the MTB – I’d rather finish a bit slower but upright and with intact wheels.”* Plenty of riders come away feeling they chose too skittish a bike and vow to go more rugged next time.
	•	**“Start farther forward in the pack.”** – *“I staged in the back thinking I’m slow, but got bottlenecked for ages in singletrack. I expended energy passing later. Better to start mid-pack or front of your wave so you’re not stuck behind less skilled riders on trail.”* With mass start, starting position matters: strong riders who start too far back get held up. Many say be assertive at staging if you have decent fitness, to save frustration.
	•	**“Train for upper body endurance.”** – *“My arms/hands were toast. I wish I’d done more push-ups or core or even some MTB rides to strengthen those muscles. Gravel riding on flat roads didn’t prepare me for the beating my body took.”* Several mention incorporating strength training specifically to handle the jarring.
	•	**“Eat solid food early.”** – *“I relied on gels only and around hour 7 my stomach was unhappy and I felt starving but couldn’t chew. I should have eaten something solid (rice bar or PB&J) in first half when pace allowed. By second half, you’re often too ragged to force it down.”* For ultra events, mixing solids is key – BWR novices often treat it like a road century (all gels) and regret it.
	•	**“It’s okay to walk some bits.”** – *“I wasted time and energy trying to ride a sand trap that I could have jogged through faster. I learned if you’re bogged down, just shoulder the bike and trot 30 yards – it can be quicker and saves a crash.”* Removing the stigma of walking is a good tip – even top pros dismount if it’s more efficient (especially if others in front already walking).
	•	**“Double Peak is not the finish – save something mentally.”** – *“I thought cresting Double Peak was finish line vibes, then realized I had a gnarly descent and a whole lap still. Mentally, I was checked out too soon. I wish I knew to keep a tiny reserve of focus for that final bit.”* Good note: don’t lose concentration at the summit; race isn’t done until you cross the line.
	•	**“The camaraderie is real – use it.”** – *“I went in thinking it’s every man for himself. But actually riders were helping each other – sharing tubes, encouraging words. I wish I’d known that vibe – I would have been less nervous and maybe more willing to ask for help or offer it. It’s a long day; the community can get you through.”* Indeed, many recall a fellow racer pulling them for a while or a stranger giving them Co2 – these acts can save your race. It’s an ethos at BWR: we suffer together and celebrate together.
	•	**Fun one:** *“Bring wet wipes in your finish bag.”* After 8-10 hours of sweat, dust, and maybe a crash or two, a quick wipe down at car before enjoying the finish feast is gold. Several mention they wish they had something to clean up or comfy shoes to change into because the post-race party is great but you want to not be in pain from bike shoes while partying.

Lastly, a humorous but true “what I wish I knew” posted by a rider:

*“I wish I knew how addictive this would be – you’ll swear ‘never again’ at the finish, but by the next day you’ll be analyzing what to do better next year.”*

And thus, the legend of the Belgian Waffle Ride grows, year after year, waffle after waffle.
