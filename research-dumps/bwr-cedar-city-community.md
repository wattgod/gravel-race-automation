# BELGIAN WAFFLE RIDE CEDAR CITY — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Melisa Rollins [ELITE]:** "Belgian Waffle Ride Cedar City was my first race on the dirt in 11 months. After finishing off my first pro season as an endurance gravel/mountain bike racer racing in the Lifetime Grand Prix in 2022, I decided to..." [won the women's race and QOM category, finishing in 6:33:00] (https://www.cyclingwest.com/racing/gravel-racing/belgian-waffle-ride-cedar-city-race-recaps/)

**Alexey Vermeulen [ELITE]:** "With so much unknown surrounding the world, let alone the cycling community, it was hard to know what to expect going into Belgian Waffle Ride. Life without racing has been hard, but what I have truly missed is the people at those races... In a weird way it is poetically similar to the current situation…and a lesson in patience and humility, knowing that on course, as in life, there will be a moment where you are forced to look outward for support in order to move forward." [finished 3rd overall in 5:59:02] (https://up.bike/blog/alexeys-belgian-waffle-ride-cedar-city/)

**Alexey Vermeulen [ELITE]:** "Coming off the final gravel section before the climb we were down to 6 riders. All we had left until the final showdown was 8 miles of false flat uphill with a headwind. Cohesion was still there as we pedaled toward the final climb, but slowly people take shorter pulls and take more time 'eating' to skip pulls the closer you get to that 'common goal'." (https://up.bike/blog/alexeys-belgian-waffle-ride-cedar-city/)

**Alexey Vermeulen [ELITE]:** "By this point I was cramping in my arms and doing what I could to move forward. This section would have been much more fun on a mountain bike with suspension, or 100 miles earlier, but alas here I was." [describing the final 4.5-mile single track section] (https://up.bike/blog/alexeys-belgian-waffle-ride-cedar-city/)

**Adam Mills [COMPETITIVE]:** "From the very beginning it was apparent that we were never going to catch group 2 and judging by the speed of their respective dust clouds they were never going to catch group 1 as long as the status quo stood. The gaps were narrow at less than 20 seconds to between Groups 1 and 2 and less than 30s to group 3. But at a consistent 30 mph even a 10s gap takes minutes of hard rotation by a number of strong riders to pull back." (https://puregravel.com/blogs/reviews/reliving-the-journey-to-belgian-waffle-ride-cedar-city)

**Adam Mills [COMPETITIVE]:** "When the odometer turns over 100km or 3-ish hours or 2100kJ whatever group I was in will probably get tired, start bickering and split again (which happened right on the money 62miles, 3:02 and 2100kJ)." (https://puregravel.com/blogs/reviews/reliving-the-journey-to-belgian-waffle-ride-cedar-city)

**Michael Marckx (Race Director):** "One very interesting tidbit about the women's race was that after the initial Red Hills QOD/KOD sector that ends at the first feed zone at mile-29, Melisa and Tiffany Cromwell were a few minutes behind the lead men, and used the Rollers for Rouleurs 10-mile unroad sector to reel the lead men's group back. It was phenomenal the way they worked together!" (https://www.cyclingwest.com/racing/gravel-racing/belgian-waffle-ride-cedar-city-race-recaps/)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Alexey Vermeulen [ELITE]:** Changed from 11-30 cassette to 11-34 after pre-riding: "The finish recon proved educational. I decided to move from an 11-30 cassette to an 11-34; the final climb was not only steep, but much sandier than I expected, and after 100 miles, it was going to be important to be able to keep wheel slippage to a minimum." (https://up.bike/blog/alexeys-belgian-waffle-ride-cedar-city/)

**Alexey Vermeulen [ELITE]:** "I ran Vittoria Terreno Dry 38mm tires with 3oz of Stan's Race Sealant inside. After conferring with Enve and their air pressure chart I started with 30PSI in the front and 31PSI in the back." (https://up.bike/blog/alexeys-belgian-waffle-ride-cedar-city/)

**Alexey Vermeulen [ELITE]:** Pre-race checks: "Once home, I did a final bike check…, bottle cages, headset, saddle, pretty much anything that could be jostled loose during a bumpy race, I tighten." (https://up.bike/blog/alexeys-belgian-waffle-ride-cedar-city/)

**Adam Mills [COMPETITIVE]:** "I was planning to ride my used IRC Boken 40c tires when Steve Driscoll scolded me for risking my day (the last race day in 2020) on anything but new tires. A few minutes later I had a fresh set on the bike and was ready to go with no issues ever." (https://puregravel.com/blogs/reviews/reliving-the-journey-to-belgian-waffle-ride-cedar-city)

**Adam Mills [COMPETITIVE]:** "Despite my insistence that I ride the brand new IRC Doublecross 42c tires (everyone that was on them seemed to do awesome) I was told that there were simply none in North America." Used IRC tires paired with Enve G23 wheels. (https://puregravel.com/blogs/reviews/reliving-the-journey-to-belgian-waffle-ride-cedar-city)

**Adam Mills [COMPETITIVE]:** "I saw lots of bottles ejected on a day in the high desert where every bottle is incredibly important. Just put some of the Bandos [Arundel Bando cages] on your bike and make your day more fun and the day of your fellow riders more safe." (https://puregravel.com/blogs/reviews/reliving-the-journey-to-belgian-waffle-ride-cedar-city)

**Adam Mills [COMPETITIVE]:** "Eyewear seems to have been pushed to the back burner of important equipment for gravel but in reality products from 100% have become invaluable. Riding behind someone on gravel feels like you're being sprayed with rocks coming off the tires in front of you." (https://puregravel.com/blogs/reviews/reliving-the-journey-to-belgian-waffle-ride-cedar-city)

**General Course Advisory [UNKNOWN LEVEL]:** "All riders are cautioned about the terrain and challenges ahead, particularly the strong headwinds between miles 42 and 94. Given the rugged conditions, participants are advised to equip their bikes with tires of at least 40mm in width." (https://strambecco.com/event/belgian-waffle-ride-bwr-utah/)

## Weather Experienced

**2023 Event:** "With comfortable overnight temperatures increasing into the mid to upper 80s throughout the day and relatively humid conditions for the area, staying hydrated and avoiding cramping was on everyone's mind. Unfortunately, some participants fell victim to these conditions." (https://rdubcreative.com/belgian-waffle-ride-cedar-city/)

**Alexey Vermeulen [ELITE] - 2020:** "With temperatures starting at 42 and ranging up to the mid 70's during the race, I had chosen to go with a mid-weight base layer, arm warmers, Castelli San Remo suit and Embrocation to keep the legs warm until the sun came up." (https://up.bike/blog/alexeys-belgian-waffle-ride-cedar-city/)

**Alexey Vermeulen [ELITE] - 2020:** "The sun was still sleeping as we rolled over to the start. The air was cold, and at this point I was happy to have my mask on because it was still keeping my face warm!" (https://up.bike/blog/alexeys-belgian-waffle-ride-cedar-city/)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Alexey Vermeulen [ELITE]:** "It was super important to not only pedal smoothly, but also pay attention to where you aimed your bike as some of the sandy sections were over 4 inches deep." [on the final climb] (https://up.bike/blog/alexeys-belgian-waffle-ride-cedar-city/)

**Alexey Vermeulen [ELITE]:** "The downhill was sketchy and lined with 'Slow the funk down' signs as a warning to anyone who would push the limits, but my real struggle came as I left the climb behind and rode the false flat toward the final test; a 4.5 mi single track section." (https://up.bike/blog/alexeys-belgian-waffle-ride-cedar-city/)

**Alexey Vermeulen [ELITE]:** "This section [4.5-mile single track] would have been much more fun on a mountain bike with suspension, or 100 miles earlier, but alas here I was. As I left the single track there were 5 miles to go." (https://up.bike/blog/alexeys-belgian-waffle-ride-cedar-city/)

**Course Overview [UNKNOWN LEVEL]:** "BWR Cedar City was set to be one of the hardest races on the gravel calendar. With 75% of the course being dirt and much of that being double or single track…whether you finished in 6 hours or finished in 10, finishing was an accomplishment." (https://up.bike/blog/alexeys-belgian-waffle-ride-cedar-city/)

**2023 Waffle Course Details:** "117 Miles / 188 Kilometers, 5,940 Feet of Climbing, 8 Road Sectors (the rest is pure Unroad), ~60% Unroad Terrain, 3 Q/KOM segments | 3 Q/KOD segments | 3 Q/KOS segments, 4 Feed Zones" (https://www.belgianwaffleride.bike/pages/utah)

**2023 Course Description:** "This year's course will showcase a fresh take on Cedar City's rugged beauty—featuring an all-new route across gravel, sand, and rock, at altitude, with a dynamic array of rippable unroad spiciness (no crazy single-track this time)." (https://www.belgianwaffleride.bike/pages/utah)

**Cedar City Elevation Context:** "Cedar City, Utah, sits at 5,846 feet above sea level, with 11,500ft Brian Head Peak a mere 30 minutes away." (https://rdubcreative.com/belgian-waffle-ride-cedar-city/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Alexey Vermeulen [ELITE]:** "I had spent 20 minutes around 350 watts normalized to get back and knew I had burnt some matches." [after reconnecting to front split on first KOM] (https://up.bike/blog/alexeys-belgian-waffle-ride-cedar-city/)

**Alexey Vermeulen [ELITE]:** "As the race entered the 2nd hour, the group had dwindled to just 7. The group included Keegan Swenson, Pete Stetina, Ryan Standish, Eric Brunner, Griffin Easter, Dylan Johnson, and me. The pace was still high once the selection had been made, and I was focusing on getting in the calories that I needed. I used a mix of Split, Honey Stinger Chews and CarboRocket 333 in my bottles." (https://up.bike/blog/alexeys-belgian-waffle-ride-cedar-city/)

**Alexey Vermeulen [ELITE]:** "Leading into the 3rd hour, our group worked much like a team. I think many people would imagine us 'racing' and trying to bludgeon each other all the way to the line, but in some sense we all had the same goal, and it was mutually beneficial to work towards the finale. This meant not only sharing the workload, but also sharing lube (because some of us forgot it - me) and even taking a small hiatus to stop for a nature break." (https://up.bike/blog/alexeys-belgian-waffle-ride-cedar-city/)

**Adam Mills [COMPETITIVE]:** "So the calculated plan was to stay with the fastest group I could manage until the Rode Heuvels (Little Salt Lake Climb) where I would ride my own tempo up and over the descent. Then I would try and re-establish myself in a quick moving group and ride with them." (https://puregravel.com/blogs/reviews/reliving-the-journey-to-belgian-waffle-ride-cedar-city)

**Adam Mills [COMPETITIVE]:** "It was imperative that I balance speed and effort to make it across the finish line as fast as possible while not overestimating my abilities, cracking, and crawling to the finish line." (https://puregravel.com/blogs/reviews/reliving-the-journey-to-belgian-waffle-ride-cedar-city)

**Adam Mills [COMPETITIVE]:** "Do your fair share in the wind while minimizing high power efforts and keep eating and drinking... Finally, save as much as you can the 45 minutes or so leading into the final climb and just go for it from there." (https://puregravel.com/blogs/reviews/reliving-the-journey-to-belgian-waffle-ride-cedar-city)

**Adam Mills [COMPETITIVE]:** "The early speeds were holding steady at 30 mph so when I suffered a typically benign mechanical early on I was immediately out of contention from the first two groups of 40-ish riders each." (https://puregravel.com/blogs/reviews/reliving-the-journey-to-belgian-waffle-ride-cedar-city)

**Adam Mills [COMPETITIVE]:** Used "Amp Human PR Lotion every day I rode in Cedar City. It's at altitude and I'd be riding hard, which is the primo situation for maximum benefit." (https://puregravel.com/blogs/reviews/reliving-the-journey-to-belgian-waffle-ride-cedar-city)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Weather-Related:** "With comfortable overnight temperatures increasing into the mid to upper 80s throughout the day and relatively humid conditions for the area, staying hydrated and avoiding cramping was on everyone's mind. Unfortunately, some participants fell victim to these conditions." (https://rdubcreative.com/belgian-waffle-ride-cedar-city/)

**Kathy Pruitt [ELITE] - 2020 Women's Race:** "World Downhill Champion Kathy Pruitt was looking to take the women's title but faced stiff competition... crashed and suffered a bad mechanical" [finished 2nd, 6+ minutes behind winner] (https://www.granfondoguide.com/Contents/Index/5751/rose-grant-and-keegan-swenson-take-gravel-victory-at-enves-belgian-waffle-ride-cedar-city)

**Equipment Failures:** "I saw lots of bottles ejected on a day in the high desert where every bottle is incredibly important." - Adam Mills [COMPETITIVE] (https://puregravel.com/blogs/reviews/reliving-the-journey-to-belgian-waffle-ride-cedar-city)

**Tire/Wheel Issues:** Adam Mills [COMPETITIVE] was warned against using used tires by Steve Driscoll who noted he was "risking my day (the last race day in 2020) on anything but new tires." (https://puregravel.com/blogs/reviews/reliving-the-journey-to-belgian-waffle-ride-cedar-city)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Michael Marckx (Race Director):** "We are family. We got all our people with us. We are family. Get up everybody and roll. Together, as a family, we have the power to transform lives... There is no better place than Utah to revel in the idea and glories of FAMILY." (https://www.cyclingwest.com/racing/gravel-racing/belgian-waffle-ride-cedar-city-race-recaps/)

**Michael Marckx (Race Director):** "The race commenced exactly on time at 7:00 a.m., which was a testament to every rider agreeing to play by the rules, and those rules were simple: Love your neighbor like family. Every single mother, father, sister, brother played along. So away we went, like a family to church." (https://www.cyclingwest.com/racing/gravel-racing/belgian-waffle-ride-cedar-city-race-recaps/)

**Alexey Vermeulen [ELITE]:** "BWR is great not only because of the race and courses, but because of the people. From pros to amateurs, every single person at the race was positive and helpful, the stories you hear after the race remind you why we all miss racing in the first place. People finished with a smile on their face before quickly dawning their masks as if it was a post-race ritual - A sense and sign of respect not only toward others, but the effort put in to have this event in a year without many." (https://up.bike/blog/alexeys-belgian-waffle-ride-cedar-city/)

**Adam Mills [COMPETITIVE]:** "When it was all over, I found myself in the company of my family who were with me during the whole trip to Cedar City. It was probably the best race day ever." (https://puregravel.com/blogs/reviews/reliving-the-journey-to-belgian-waffle-ride-cedar-city)

**COVID-19 Protocols (2020):** "This is an event during a pandemic and no one wants to take that sort of souvenir home or give it to anyone locally. Keeping safe needed to be the most important thing. From the very beginning MoC set out to have an event that was safe and fun. They went about it by finding the proper professionals to help them fashion an event protocol that kept the athletes, volunteers, authorities and spectators safe." (https://puregravel.com/blogs/reviews/reliving-the-journey-to-belgian-waffle-ride-cedar-city)

**Event Atmosphere:** "The BWR Unroad Expo, teeming with live music, a beer garden, ample waffles, and the festive spirit of Utah... pre-race party on Friday night sets the mood for the race, and the post-race celebrations include revealing the winner of the Canyon Bike/OpiCure bike giveaway and loads of Rouleur's signature Badass Ale." (https://strambecco.com/event/belgian-waffle-ride-bwr-utah/)

**Cedar City Hospitality:** "Cedar City continues to welcome us with open arms, rolling out the red, yellow, and black carpet to host one of the most unique endurance weekends in the country." (https://www.belgianwaffleride.bike/pages/utah)
