## 3. TERRAIN & COURSE

### High Desert Character

BWR Utah takes place in Utah's high desert, delivering an experience distinctly different from the coastal California event:

> "Utah's landscape trades ocean air for alpine altitude—rolling through red-rock valleys, sandy sectors, and long, punishing stretches of gravel under the open desert sky."

### Elevation Profile

- **Starting Elevation:** 5,846 feet (1,718 meters) above sea level - highest starting elevation of all BWR events
- **Max Elevation:** ~6,879 ft (based on 2024 course)
- **Total Climbing:** ~5,940 - 7,800 ft depending on year/course variant
- **Average Race Altitude:** ~5,800 ft

### Surface Types

The course traditionally features multiple surface types:

- **Gravel roads** - Primary surface
- **Rocky singletrack** - Technical sections (reduced for 2026)
- **Sandy sectors** - Including "playground-type sand"
- **Chunky dirt roads** - High desert double-track
- **Jeep roads** - Rocky 4x4 trails
- **Packed dirt rollers** - Flowing sections
- **Asphalt sectors** - Road connections between off-road sections

### 2026 Course Changes

> "The 2026 course removes technical single-track in favor of flowing dirt and gravel sections that reward power, skill, and strategy. Riders will face ever-changing terrain—from sandy washboard to packed-dirt rollers to open-road climbs at altitude."

- All-new route design
- Removes "crazy single-track"
- Emphasizes "rippable unroad spiciness"
- Rewards power, skill, and strategy over pure technical ability

### Unroad Percentage

- Historical courses featured up to 92% "unroad" (non-paved surfaces)
- 2025/2026 Waffle course: ~60% unroad
- 2025/2026 Wafer course: ~68% unroad
- The course uniquely blends singletrack and paved roads, making equipment decisions challenging

### Notable Course Features

- Red rock valleys and formations
- Vast plateaus with 360-degree views
- Sandy sectors requiring specific riding skills
- Strong headwinds typically between miles 42-94
- Creek/water crossings on some editions
- Tolweg singletrack section (technical)

### ENVE Athlete Tips & Race Reports

**What Worked:**
- Course familiarity and pre-riding key technical sections
- ENVE G23 wheels for chunky terrain (vs. aero wheels used in San Diego)
- 40-44c tires minimum for real gravel conditions
- Tubeless setup absolutely essential (riders with tubes flatted repeatedly)
- 1:1 gearing or better for climbs
- Pre-riding technical descents to know when to attack

**What Didn't Work:**
- Running out of electrolytes (hydration is critical at altitude)
- Inadequate sand riding skills (Bay Area riders struggled)
- Dust and altitude combination challenging for lungs
- Flat tires from "lava slicer rocks"

**Pro Tips:**
- Bring a "finish bottle" with 400 calories of carb mix and caffeine for last two hours
- Consider wearing a buff over mouth in dusty sections
- Pack extra electrolyte mix beyond what you think you need

### Adam Roberge Race Report (Pro Cyclist)

Key insights from his BWR Utah experience:
- Race mantra: "Fear nothing, respect everything"
- Committed to strict focus throughout the race
- Breaks race into three parts: start to 10km singletrack, singletrack to last climb, last climb to finish
- Strong crosswind encountered after first 20km
- Had to exert nearly maximum effort for 4 minutes to recover from bad positioning

### Pete Stetina's 2024 Report

> "The day was very complicated with freezing temps, strong winds, rugged singletrack, and motivated riders taking their chances."

- Won 2 of 3 Utah appearances
- Arrived in 2024 "hungry and desperate" after being shut out in 2023
- Noted the pro gravel field has gotten very competitive

## 6. BLACK PILL

### Honest Truths About BWR Cedar City

**Altitude Reality:**
- Starting at 5,846 feet is no joke - even though not technically "high altitude," it will affect performance
- Your FTP is effectively a few percent lower
- Pacing by power numbers will fail you; use heart rate in early miles
- "Flat-landers" from sea level will feel short of breath, dehydrated, and low energy
- The altitude "will likely cause things to split up earlier and more than other BWRs held below 3,000 feet"

**Terrain Truth:**
- This is NOT a smooth gravel race - it's chunky, rocky, and sandy
- Sand sectors have ended races for riders without proper skills
- Rocky sections have caused numerous flats and wheel damage
- "Lava slicer rocks" are real and will find your tires

**Weather Variability:**
- June doesn't guarantee good weather - 2024 had snow and was shortened
- Wind is a constant factor, especially miles 42-94
- Temperature swings from low 50s to mid-80s in a single race day
- Dust at altitude is brutal on lungs

**Equipment Demands:**
- Tires: 40mm minimum, 42-44mm recommended
- Tubeless is mandatory - tubes will flat repeatedly
- Need at least 1:1 gearing or you'll be hiking
- Aero advantages diminish significantly on technical terrain

**Logistics Reality:**
- Nearest major airport (Las Vegas) is 2.5-3 hours away
- Cedar City has limited hotel inventory - book early
- Remote high-desert location means limited support services

**Competition Level:**
- This is a pro-level field - Keegan Swenson, Pete Stetina, Sofia Gomez Villafane have all raced here
- The front group moves fast: "first 3.5 hours at an average of ~23mph" reported
- If you lose the lead group in technical sections, you may never reconnect
