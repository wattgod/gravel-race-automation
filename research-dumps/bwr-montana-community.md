# BWR MONTANA — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**MikeMckinney [COMPETITIVE]:** "Race Organization: Check in and parking were excellent. Elevation: Don't forget Bozeman is at 4800 ft, and you ride up to 5500 feet numerous times which you will notice if you don't normally ride that high. Course: The waffle section (north loop) is beautiful, the views are incredible, its much more scenic than the wafer and wanna sections of the course (you complete all three). 60 % is unroad, lots of gravel country roads. Many long sustained climbs, with a total of 7900 feet of elevation gain. I had a total of 19 climbs on my head unit, with only 1 punchy section that was 11 percent, but it comes around mile 90."

**MikeMckinney [COMPETITIVE]:** "The last 4 ish miles is single track. This was advertised as being awesome, but It was open to the public, and was pretty rocky. Got caught up with some riders walking the steep section in the middle, ended up having to walk, and a few non racer were using the trail riding against the flow." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/bwr-montana-june-29th/103804)

**MikeMckinney [COMPETITIVE]:** "Aid stops: Were well stocked and appropriately placed, roughly at 22, 39, 67, 98. Had cold coke which was a bonus." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/bwr-montana-june-29th/103804)

**ToddAMelton [COMPETITIVE]:** "I really enjoyed the event as well as spending in and around Bozeman. I am already planning to do it again.

It seemed as though a good percentage of the racers had participated in other BWR events this year." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/bwr-montana-june-29th/103804)

**ToddAMelton [COMPETITIVE]:** "I found the gravel roads to be of much higher quality than what I've seen anywhere in Oregon or Northern California; very few potholes, some loose gravel but not scary thick, no big sharp rocks, a little bit of washboarding but more baby washboards, and some sections were near paved quality. The single track near the end was pretty special." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/bwr-montana-june-29th/103804)

**BH107 [COMPETITIVE] (local Bozeman rider):** "I live in Bozeman and it has been pretty dry this spring.
