# BELGIAN WAFFLE RIDE NORTH CAROLINA — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Adam Roberge [ELITE]:** "It was so fun, please keep this race. I don't know if I'm biased since I like the East Coast, but this course is just perfection." (https://www.granfondoguide.com/Contents/PopUp/8743/emily-newsome-and-adam-roberge-take-victory-at-2025-belgian-waffle-ride-north-carolina)

**Emily Newsome [ELITE]:** "We started with the guys, so it was a big group and pretty chill until the first long climb, where it exploded. I was a little worried because I wasn't sure if my legs were good, but I warmed up and I was able to get with a really good group of men. We stuck together for almost the entire race. I pushed it really hard on the climbs and tried to hang through all the technical stuff." (https://www.granfondoguide.com/Contents/PopUp/8743/emily-newsome-and-adam-roberge-take-victory-at-2025-belgian-waffle-ride-north-carolina)

**Paige Onweller [ELITE]:** "I also want to highlight that anger and hate directed to a person or an event do not accomplish anything. At the current state, race organizers are in a very difficult position... Additionally, underneath all helmets is a face and a person who deserves respect, dignity and a safe space to ride bikes. In the future, I feel a separate category is appropriate but event promoters are also learning what is best to preserve both female cycling while also creating an inclusive space for all to ride." (https://cyclingmagazine.ca/gravel/adam-roberge-and-austin-killips-victorious-at-belgian-waffle-ride-in-north-carolina/)

**ARR53 [UNKNOWN]:** "Absolutely brutal 130 mile and 13,000ft gravel race with lots of technical singletrack." (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/vc5knt/footage_from_my_belgian_waffle_ride_north/)

**howyaderrn [UNKNOWN]:** "The course is 144 miles with 12,000 ft of climbing. 95 of those miles are on the road, with the remaining 50 or so being on 'rooty trails and gravel roads', according to the event info. Apparently the gravel sections will be considerably more challenging than the typical hard-pack at the California race and they're recommending a 32mm tire regardless of experience/bike handling abilities." (https://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/comments/o6nhk8/bike_choice_help_weight_vs_comfort_at_belgian/)

**lazycouncilor [UNKNOWN]:** "I did a 40 mile gravel loop in Pisgah on the MTB last month so I'm certain it can handle it, but the Roubaix is way lighter for 10k feet of climbing." (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/s4q6fx/thinking_of_doing_the_belgian_waffle_ride_in/)

**PatrickStewy [UNKNOWN]:** "I had an unpleasant crash whilst riding my gravel bike over the weekend that included a concussion and being knocked out for several minutes. Unfortunately, my injuries will prevent me from riding at the Belgian Waffle Ride North Carolina race... As an aside, based on the damage to my helmet - which cracked and split the hard foam - it likely saved my life." (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/v6xoj6/transferring_my_bwr_nc_registration/)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**[UNKNOWN LEVEL]** The race organizers recommended 32mm tires minimum "regardless of experience/bike handling abilities" due to the challenging gravel sections being "considerably more challenging than the typical hard-pack at the California race." (https://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/comments/o6nhk8/bike_choice_help_weight_vs_comfort_at_belgian/)

**[UNKNOWN LEVEL - Recreational rider debate]** One rider debated between a Surly Straggler (steel, heavier, more comfortable) with 50-34/11-34 gearing versus an Allez Sprint Disc (lighter by ~6lbs, more responsive) with 52-36/11-28 gearing. They were considering swapping to 11-32 or 11-34 cassette on the Allez if using it. The rider noted: "I'm leaning toward the Straggler at the moment since the steel frame will provide much more comfort and the bike itself will be better suited for all of the rough gravel... while the Allez is definitely the antithesis of a gravel bike given its geometry, I'm still considering it given the weight advantage with all of those road miles and elevation gain." (https://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/comments/o6nhk8/bike_choice_help_weight_vs_comfort_at_belgian/)

**[UNKNOWN LEVEL]** Another rider considered choosing between a Roubaix with 32mm knobby tires or an 80s MTB with drop bars and 26" 2.2 tires, questioning whether 32mm would be enough. (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/s4q6fx/thinking_of_doing_the_belgian_waffle_ride_in/)

**[COMPETITIVE LEVEL - The Pro's Closet recommendations]** Professional bike shop staff suggested three gravel bikes for BWR NC:

- **ENVE MOG:** Can run 40-50mm tires. Staff noted they would "swap the tires for something a little wider (likely 40-42mm) and a bit lighter of a wheelset for raceday." Features cargo-bay downtube storage.

- **Cervelo Aspero:** "Leans pretty dang hard towards the road side" with clearance up to 42mm tires. "This option would be a huge advantage on faster sections and would hold its own on singletrack for riders with better than average bike handling skills." One staff member had success at SBTGRVL on an Aspero despite poor gearing (1x11).

- **Allied ABLE:** Described as "fast" and "nimble-handling, responsive." This model featured a Classified rear hub providing 2x gearing range without a front derailleur.

- **Trek Checkpoint ALR:** Budget aluminum option that "finds a great balance of confidence and performance at an incredible value." Can run 700x45mm tires. (https://www.theproscloset.com/blogs/news/belgian-waffle-ride-north-carolina-hell-of-the-east)

## Weather Experienced

**Course Composition:** "95 of those miles are on the road, with the remaining 50 or so being on 'rooty trails and gravel roads'" according to event info. The terrain varies "from hard-packed and flat to loose, rocky, uphill, and downhill gravel." (https://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/comments/o6nhk8/bike_choice_help_weight_vs_comfort_at_belgian/, https://strambecco.com/event/belgian-waffle-ride-asheville-north-carolina/)

**Key Race Feature:** "The course's decisive climb with about 35 miles remaining" was where Cole Davis surged clear before Roberge bridged and countered in the 2025 race. (https://www.granfondoguide.com/Contents/PopUp/8743/emily-newsome-and-adam-roberge-take-victory-at-2025-belgian-waffle-ride-north-carolina)

**First Climb:** [ELITE] Emily Newsome described the first long climb as where "it exploded" after a "pretty chill" start with the men's field. (https://www.granfondoguide.com/Contents/PopUp/8743/emily-newsome-and-adam-roberge-take-victory-at-2025-belgian-waffle-ride-north-carolina)

**Overall Character:** The event is described as "possibly the hilliest of the BWR Series events" and has earned the title "THE HELL OF THE EAST." It features "many unpaved sections with various surfaces" and is known for "punchy climbs that challenge riders mentally and physically." (https://strambecco.com/event/belgian-waffle-ride-asheville-north-carolina/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**[ELITE - 4:46:26 finish time]** Adam Roberge's winning strategy in 2025: Joined forces with a small front group after an early aggressive move. On the decisive climb with ~35 miles remaining, he bridged up to Cole Davis who had surged clear, then countered and "ultimately rode away to a two-minute victory margin." (https://www.granfondoguide.com/Contents/PopUp/8743/emily-newsome-and-adam-roberge-take-victory-at-2025-belgian-waffle-ride-north-carolina)

**[ELITE - 5:25:23 finish time]** Emily Newsome's winning strategy: "Started with the guys" in a large group that was "pretty chill until the first long climb." After the climb exploded the field, she "was able to get with a really good group of men. We stuck together for almost the entire race. I pushed it really hard on the climbs and tried to hang through all the technical stuff." She won by 23 minutes. (https://www.granfondoguide.com/Contents/PopUp/8743/emily-newsome-and-adam-roberge-take-victory-at-2025-belgian-waffle-ride-north-carolina)

**[UNKNOWN LEVEL - Recreational rider strategy consideration]** One rider planning for the event noted: "I'm mostly a crit racer and have solid fitness, however this will for sure be one of my longest days on the bike and climbing is not my strong-suit. I'm planning to do a number of 100+ mile rides this summer to evaluate comfort on both setups... the time I'd lose on climbs would hopefully be offset by comfort and confidence on the technical sections/descents, and all around not feeling so thrashed during the long day." They were aiming to finish rather than win, but didn't want to be "so slow that I'm spending 12 hours on the bike." (https://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/comments/o6nhk8/bike_choice_help_weight_vs_comfort_at_belgian/)

**Drafting Opportunities:** The rider above noted planning to "draft most of the time in different groups in the race." (https://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/comments/o6nhk8/bike_choice_help_weight_vs_comfort_at_belgian/)

**Training Preparation:** BWR partnered with FasCat Coaching to create a customized 6-week training plan starting January 22, with Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced options. The plan includes "a progressively extended gravel simulation ride, mirroring the race's demands" and covers "nutrition and hydration tips practiced during these rides." It incorporates "Sweet Spot and Tempo intervals, group rides, recovery techniques, rest days, yoga, and foundational exercises" with "spicy intervals and a proper taper" as the event approaches. (https://strambecco.com/event/belgian-waffle-ride-asheville-north-carolina/)

**Nutrition Resources:** BWR created the "BWR Guide to Eating Like a Semi-Pro" covering "all aspects of cycling nutrition, including hydration, supplementation, gut training, carb-loading, recovery, on-bike feeding, and more." (https://strambecco.com/event/belgian-waffle-ride-asheville-north-carolina/)

**Aid Station Spacing:** "Well-stocked aid stations every 20 miles" are provided throughout the course. (https://strambecco.com/event/belgian-waffle-ride-asheville-north-carolina/)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Mechanicals:** [ELITE] Evan Boyle (Axeon Hagens Berman Jayco) was the early race leader with a gap of over three minutes but suffered "two punctures and a broken saddle" that "ended his day at approximately 60 miles" in the 2025 race. (https://www.granfondoguide.com/Contents/PopUp/8743/emily-newsome-and-adam-roberge-take-victory-at-2025-belgian-waffle-ride-north-carolina)

**Punctures:** [ELITE] Brody McDonald suffered a "puncture on the big climb" in 2025, which reshaped the race contest. (https://www.granfondoguide.com/Contents/PopUp/8743/emily-newsome-and-adam-roberge-take-victory-at-2025-belgian-waffle-ride-north-carolina)

**Crashes:** [UNKNOWN] One rider reported a serious crash during training: "I had an unpleasant crash whilst riding my gravel bike over the weekend that included a concussion and being knocked out for several minutes" which prevented them from racing. Their helmet "cracked and split the hard foam" and "likely saved my life." (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/v6xoj6/transferring_my_bwr_nc_registration/)

**Attrition:** The 2025 men's race was "marked by tactical aggression and attrition that favored experienced, resilient riders." Only five elite women finished the 99-mile Waffle race in 2025, with "massive time gaps early on." (https://www.granfondoguide.com/Contents/PopUp/8743/emily-newsome-and-adam-roberge-take-victory-at-2025-belgian-waffle-ride-north-carolina)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Event Atmosphere:** The event features Belgian waffles, beer from local breweries (Salt Face Mule Brewing is the official beer partner), and a large BWR Unroad Expo with over 40 vendors.

In 2025, proceeds from the Shakeout Burrito Ride went "directly to helping young riders discover the joy of cycling" through Asheville Youth Cycling. The event also worked with local groups for Hurricane Helene relief efforts. (https://www.belgianwaffleride.bike/pages/northcarolina)

**Venue:** Held at Wag Valley Farm near Hendersonville/Asheville, described as "an incredible destination" in the Blue Ridge Mountains. The location features scenic "fall colors" during the October event. (https://www.granfondoguide.com/Contents/PopUp/8743/emily-newsome-and-adam-roberge-take-victory-at-2025-belgian-waffle-ride-north-carolina, https://www.belgianwaffleride.bike/pages/northcarolina)

**Scenic Beauty:** Multiple sources praised the "flow, scenery and challenge" of the route, with "glorious greenery" and "scenic mountaintop vistas." (https://www.granfondoguide.com/Contents/PopUp/8743/emily-newsome-and-adam-roberge-take-victory-at-2025-belgian-waffle-ride-north-carolina, https://www.belgianwaffleride.bike/pages/northcarolina)

**Registration:** The event does not appear to sell out immediately. One Reddit user asked "if I have some time to consider before committing or if these things sell-out right away?" suggesting they're not instant sellouts. (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/qvhfi7/does_the_belgian_waffle_ride_sellout/)
