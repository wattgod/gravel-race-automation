# BELGIAN WAFFLE RIDE SAN DIEGO — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Yun [UNKNOWN]:** "I didn't expect to be at the start line of the 2025 Belgian Waffle Ride in San Diego. Between a new job, family-wide respiratory illness, and a never-ending sleep deficit, this wasn't exactly the ideal lead-up to a 100-mile gravel race... We were two of just 21 women to finish the Waffle that day. Only about two-thirds of the 300 men finished." (https://thresholdcycling.com/blogs/training-resources/from-doubt-to-dirt-my-grit-fueled-ride-at-belgian-waffle)

**Yun [UNKNOWN]:** "With 1,500 riders rolling out together, we got caught behind bottlenecks on early singletrack—losing nearly 45 minutes before the race even really began... At the second station, Keri took off, determined to beat the 11:30 a.m. deadline. I chased her through endless steep hills, my legs protesting every 15–17% gradient with increasing rage." (https://thresholdcycling.com/blogs/training-resources/from-doubt-to-dirt-my-grit-fueled-ride-at-belgian-waffle)

**Yun [UNKNOWN]:** "Just when we thought we were done, the course served us one last cruel combo: a dam, a lake, an eternal set of switchbacks, and the choice between a hike-a-bike or a creek crossing. We chose the creek—and slammed our bikes into hidden boulders. I went full submersion. Honestly, it felt amazing on my burning feet... we finished the race together—beating the 10-hour cutoff by the skin of our teeth." (https://thresholdcycling.com/blogs/training-resources/from-doubt-to-dirt-my-grit-fueled-ride-at-belgian-waffle)

**Chris Brown [COMPETITIVE]:** Took the win in the Wanna event riding an Ultimate G2. Troy Templin [COMPETITIVE] placed second on a Spezia, "placing three Litespeeds in the top 10 finishers." (https://litespeed.com/blogs/litespeed-stories/2024-belgian-waffle-ride-san-diego-dusted-belgian-style)

**Nick Leeper [ELITE]:** "My goal was to make it over the climb in the 2nd group and I was right where I wanted to be after an 8-minute effort at 440 watts. Things went south quickly on the dirt though as I came around a corner and a rider was standing in the line fixing a dropped chain... Fortunately, the bike and I were ok, but I dropped 30 seconds to my group." Finished in 7:23, 91st place. (https://signaturecycles.com/journal/nick-leeper-bwr-ca)

**Nick Leeper [ELITE]:** "There was a puncture on the tread and near the tire bead. The sealant eventually worked but I had to air up multiple times and hold my bike sideways to get the sealant to pool at the puncture before sealing properly. I still had 15 miles of dirt to go until I saw pavement again... Once on the tarmac, I grouped up with 10-15 guys and we went into endurance mode." (https://signaturecycles.com/journal/nick-leeper-bwr-ca)

**Nick Leeper [ELITE]:** "Once I hit the Double Peak climb, I couldn't push my target power of 300 watts. I was pushing 270 and getting passed more than I should have." (https://signaturecycles.com/journal/nick-leeper-bwr-ca)

**Julie Dunkle [RECREATIONAL]:** "Of 27 women who lined up for the 107-mile Belgian Waffle Ride, only 22 of us crossed the finish line. Meanwhile, 373 men started, and 355 finished... 8:20 later, I crossed the finish line. It felt like riding through quicksand, but I made it." (https://juliedunkle.substack.com/p/belgian-waffle-ride-san-diego)

**Julie Dunkle [RECREATIONAL]:** "Right away, your bike handling skills and patience were tested—especially when we had a 15-minute walking section up a technical but mostly rideable section, but due to the crowds we slowly walked it all... Then came what felt like 97 turns through Ramona on dirt roads riddled with maxed-out potholes." (https://juliedunkle.substack.com/p/belgian-waffle-ride-san-diego)

**Julie Dunkle [RECREATIONAL]:** "I rolled into an aid station, out of fluids and barely hanging on. Legitimately, I chugged two Cokes and had a saint of a volunteer fill my bottle before I slammed 120g of carbs just to get back in the game." (https://juliedunkle.substack.com/p/belgian-waffle-ride-san-diego)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Nick Leeper [ELITE]:** "I chose to ride the Enve Melee with 48/35 chainrings, 10-36 cassette, and 35c Pirelli Cinturato Gravel H tires mounted on Zipp 303 Firecrest wheels at 44 PSI. I thought my setup would be quick on the pavement and have enough tire volume to be comfortable on dirt." However, he later noted: "I didn't have a lot of cornering and braking confidence with the 35c tires on the loose over hard single track we spent a lot of time on." (https://signaturecycles.com/journal/nick-leeper-bwr-ca)

**Nick Leeper [ELITE] - What He'd Change:** "I would run a mullet setup with a 48T chainring and a 10-52 cassette. This would allow me to run the 38c Specialized Pathfinder Pro tires and have a lower gear for some of the +20% gradient climbs near the end of the ride... The wider tire would let me run lower pressure and have some better grip in those sectors." (https://signaturecycles.com/journal/nick-leeper-bwr-ca)

**Troy Templin [COMPETITIVE]:** Chose the new Spezia (clearance to 35mm tires) for the Wanna event - "a light, racy" option. (https://litespeed.com/blogs/litespeed-stories/2024-belgian-waffle-ride-san-diego-dusted-belgian-style)

**Chris Brown [COMPETITIVE]:** Selected the Ultimate G2 for the Wanna event, which "recently received accolade in the gravel bike category in Bicycling Magazine's 2023 Bike Awards." (https://litespeed.com/blogs/litespeed-stories/2024-belgian-waffle-ride-san-diego-dusted-belgian-style)

**AbbottRacing [ELITE] - Reddit:** "I am riding a Laugh true grit with 38 Specialized pathfinder pro tires and Victoria run flat inserts. I generally run about 30psi." Asking for advice on tire/pressure for "pavement or hard packed gravel" endurance events. (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/u2w23p/belgium_waffle_california_tire_gear_choice/)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Course Evolution - Pete Stetina [ELITE] observation:** "Pete Stetina changed his view of the course and said this year it was a gravel race with road sectors" - referring to how the event has evolved from "a road race with some dirt sectors." (https://signaturecycles.com/journal/nick-leeper-bwr-ca)

**2025 Course - Yun [UNKNOWN]:** "11 miles in and hit the first bottleneck... 23 unroad sectors... At Station 3, around mile 60, volunteers told us future aid stops might not be manned... A brief trail section lifted our spirits, as did Keri's expertise in picking the best MTB lines." (https://thresholdcycling.com/blogs/training-resources/from-doubt-to-dirt-my-grit-fueled-ride-at-belgian-waffle)

**Highland Valley Road - Yun [UNKNOWN]:** "Oh Highland Valley, I will never forget you!!! It did get easier—sort of... But the course wasn't exactly scenic enough to distract from the pain." (https://thresholdcycling.com/blogs/training-resources/from-doubt-to-dirt-my-grit-fueled-ride-at-belgian-waffle)

**Pamo Valley - Yun [UNKNOWN]:** "Somewhere in the chaos, I dropped my chain, lost Keri, missed a trail, and somehow ended up ahead of her. Once we reunited, we began the soul-crushing climb through what I now call Death Valley—aka Pamo Valley. A fierce headwind met us on the return." (https://thresholdcycling.com/blogs/training-resources/from-doubt-to-dirt-my-grit-fueled-ride-at-belgian-waffle)

**Creek Crossing Decision - Yun [UNKNOWN]:** "Just when we thought we were done, the course served us one last cruel combo: a dam, a lake, an eternal set of switchbacks, and the choice between a hike-a-bike or a creek crossing. We chose the creek—and slammed our bikes into hidden boulders." (https://thresholdcycling.com/blogs/training-resources/from-doubt-to-dirt-my-grit-fueled-ride-at-belgian-waffle)

**Julie Dunkle [RECREATIONAL]:** "After that, it was onto Lemontwist and Hodges—familiar stomping grounds—before splitting off from the Wafer route and heading up Highland Valley Road. Then came what felt like 97 turns through Ramona on dirt roads riddled with maxed-out potholes. And just when you thought it couldn't get worse, bam! A steep descent that made your heart skip a beat." (https://juliedunkle.substack.com/p/belgian-waffle-ride-san-diego)

**Lusardi Switchbacks - Julie Dunkle [RECREATIONAL]:** "I powered through Hodges and those damn Lusardi switchbacks. I unclipped a few times, opting to stay on the bike for the most part." (https://juliedunkle.substack.com/p/belgian-waffle-ride-san-diego)

**Nick Leeper [ELITE]:** "The race kicked off at 7am and hits a 1.7-mile road climb at mile 4 to break the field up before descending into the first dirt sector... we tackled the technical single track until I hit a square edged rock and felt my rear tire go soft... took another spill on a rain rutted downhill... Once on the tarmac, I grouped up with 10-15 guys." (https://signaturecycles.com/journal/nick-leeper-bwr-ca)

**Nick Leeper [ELITE] on Technical Sections:** "After that it was flat until mile 116 when the 5-mile climb to Double Peak begins. But before Double Peak we raced 12 miles of technical single track with a lot more sharp-edged rock." (https://signaturecycles.com/journal/nick-leeper-bwr-ca)

**2025 Weather Impact:** "Southern California received a lot of rain this year which rutted out the dirt and made it pretty rough." (https://signaturecycles.com/journal/nick-leeper-bwr-ca)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Nick Leeper [ELITE] - Power Targets:** "My goal was to make it over the climb in the 2nd group and I was right where I wanted to be after an 8-minute effort at 440 watts... Once I hit the Double Peak climb, I couldn't push my target power of 300 watts. I was pushing 270 and getting passed more than I should have." (https://signaturecycles.com/journal/nick-leeper-bwr-ca)

**Yun [UNKNOWN] - Cutoff Strategy:** "After skipping the first aid station, we found ourselves sprinting between cutoffs. At the second station, Keri took off, determined to beat the 11:30 a.m. deadline." Finished just under the 10-hour cutoff. (https://thresholdcycling.com/blogs/training-resources/from-doubt-to-dirt-my-grit-fueled-ride-at-belgian-waffle)

**Yun [UNKNOWN] - Aid Station Strategy:** "At Station 3, around mile 60, volunteers told us future aid stops might not be manned. We stuffed our pockets with bars, gels, and Coke and committed to the final push—ready or not." (https://thresholdcycling.com/blogs/training-resources/from-doubt-to-dirt-my-grit-fueled-ride-at-belgian-waffle)

**Nick Leeper [ELITE] - Fueling:** "My fuelling was on point, targeting 90-100 grams of carbs per hour in my bottles and 4 bottles of Delta G ketones spread over the day." (https://signaturecycles.com/journal/nick-leeper-bwr-ca)

**Julie Dunkle [RECREATIONAL] - Crisis Fueling:** "I rolled into an aid station, out of fluids and barely hanging on. Legitimately, I chugged two Cokes and had a saint of a volunteer fill my bottle before I slammed 120g of carbs just to get back in the game." (https://juliedunkle.substack.com/p/belgian-waffle-ride-san-diego)

**Yun [UNKNOWN] - What She Ate:** "Dates rolled in granola and peanut butter and salt along with the tens of Stryker Gels, NeverSecond drink mix, and my LMNT salts and some gummies along the way!" (https://thresholdcycling.com/blogs/training-resources/from-doubt-to-dirt-my-grit-fueled-ride-at-bright-waffle)

**Nick Leeper [ELITE] - Mechanical Decision:** "I also should have stopped to air up my tire one more time so I could have attacked the dirt sections a bit harder." (https://signaturecycles.com/journal/nick-leeper-bwr-ca)

**Start Line Positioning - Yun [UNKNOWN]:** "Race morning came, and we couldn't even see the front of the pack where we were supposed to start. With 1,500 riders rolling out together, we got caught behind bottlenecks on early singletrack—losing nearly 45 minutes before the race even really began." (https://thresholdcycling.com/blogs/training-resources/from-doubt-to-dirt-my-grit-fueled-ride-at-belgian-waffle)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Bottlenecks - Yun [UNKNOWN]:** "With 1,500 riders rolling out together, we got caught behind bottlenecks on early singletrack—losing nearly 45 minutes before the race even really began... we had a 15-minute walking section up a technical but mostly rideable section, but due to the crowds we slowly walked it all." (https://thresholdcycling.com/blogs/training-resources/from-doubt-to-dirt-my-grit-fueled-ride-at-belgian-waffle / https://juliedunkle.substack.com/p/belgian-waffle-ride-san-diego)

**Mechanicals - Nick Leeper [ELITE]:** "I hit a square edged rock and felt my rear tire go soft. There was a puncture on the tread and near the tire bead. The sealant eventually worked but I had to air up multiple times and hold my bike sideways to get the sealant to pool at the puncture before sealing properly. I still had 15 miles of dirt to go until I saw pavement again. I nursed the tire the best I could but was haemorrhaging time." (https://signaturecycles.com/journal/nick-leeper-bwr-ca)

**Crashes - Nick Leeper [ELITE]:** "My only option to avoid him lead me to crash into a wood post fence. Fortunately, the bike and I were ok, but I dropped 30 seconds to my group... took another spill on a rain rutted downhill." (https://signaturecycles.com/journal/nick-leeper-bwr-ca)

**Finish Rates - Yun [UNKNOWN]:** "We were two of just 21 women to finish the Waffle that day. Only about two-thirds of the 300 men finished." That's approximately 22 women finishers out of 27 starters, and 355 men out of 373. (https://thresholdcycling.com/blogs/training-resources/from-doubt-to-dirt-my-grit-fueled-ride-at-belgian-waffle)

(https://litespeed.com/blogs/litespeed-stories/2024-belgian-waffle-ride-san-diego-dusted-belgian-style)

**Rain Impact - Nick Leeper [ELITE]:** "Southern California received a lot of rain this year which rutted out the dirt and made it pretty rough." (https://signaturecycles.com/journal/nick-leeper-bwr-ca)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Nick Leeper [ELITE]:** "We talk a lot about bike setup, nutrition, race results etc. but the best thing about these races is the people. Two friends invited me to stay in an Airbnb with two others I didn't know. I met the Opicure Foundation team on a pre-ride, we ended up having dinner together, and I rode with three of them at different points on race day... At the end of the weekend, I have seven more friends that I'm sure I'll see again at future events." (https://signaturecycles.com/journal/nick-leeper-bwr-ca)

**Nick Leeper [ELITE]:** "I would highly recommend any of the BWR events. They put on a good show, provide a lot of support, and the two courses I have done (Utah and California) have been challenging and unique." (https://signaturecycles.com/journal/nick-leeper-bwr-ca)

**Litespeed at the Expo:** "Litespeed was on site at the Unroad Expo, and the vibe was high as racers brought their Litespeeds to our booth for complimentary pre-race service and safety checks, ensuring stem and seat binder bolts were to torque, ready for a bumpy day in the saddle." (https://litespeed.com/blogs/litespeed-stories/2024-belgian-waffle-ride-san-diego-dusted-belgian-style)

**Yun [UNKNOWN]:** "Gravel isn't just harder than road—it's way more dynamic, and honestly, a lot more fun... It was brutal. It was suffering. And somehow, it was fun." (https://thresholdcycling.com/blogs/training-resources/from-doubt-to-dirt-my-grit-fueled-ride-at-belgian-waffle)

**Julie Dunkle [RECREATIONAL]:** "John, the absolute legend he is, was out there with SAG and moral support, shouting from the sidelines to catch up to a guy ahead. I did just that, tucking in behind him for a bit." (https://juliedunkle.substack.com/p/belgian-waffle-ride-san-diego)

**Event History:** "It was 2011 when just 136 people showed up for the first ever Belgian Waffle Ride. What it was was anyone's guess. Event organizer Michael Marckx envisioned an event in the spirit of the Belgian Classics; a road race with lots of dirt, hills and distance... Back then, it was a run-what-ya-brung mentality; 25mm clinchers on rim brake road bikes was really all you had." (https://litespeed.com/blogs/litespeed-stories/2024-belgian-waffle-ride-san-diego-dusted-belgian-style)

**Philanthropy:** "BWR CA benefits PeopleForBikes, an organization dedicated to making biking better for everyone." (https://strambecco.com/event/belgian-waffle-ride-san-diego-california/)

**Lance Haidet's Video:** "Our friend Lance Haidet showed up in full form for BWR, and he brought his filmer along for the ride. Together, they put together an awesome video that covers the build-up, race-day action, and a spoken-word recap straight from Lance himself." (https://almsthre.com/blogs/news/bwr-san-diego-2025)

**ALMSTHRE Shakeout Ride:** "The day before the big event, we hosted the ALMSTHRE x BWR Shakeout Ride—and it turned into something pretty special. Over 100 riders showed up to preview key parts of the course, connect with the community, and get those pre-race jitters out." (https://almsthre.com/blogs/news/bwr-san-diego-2025)
