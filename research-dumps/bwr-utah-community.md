# BWR UTAH — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Melisa Rollins [ELITE]:** "I actually was pretty frustrated with gravel because I didn't feel like I was strong enough to really race. I was always kind of a participant and finished in that middle-pack range. So, I took a step back from gravel and really focused on that higher-end power earlier this year... I was able to hang. I was the last person to not make the lead men's group and I was kind of in no man's land." (https://thefeed.com/insider/gold-for-rollins-at-bwr-utah)

**Melisa Rollins [ELITE]:** "I crashed in the single track and I bent my derailleur hanger, losing my easiest gears. [It] was fine for the most part because the course is pretty flat, except for the last climb at 110... I instantly started cramping in both of my legs, both quads, both adductors, and my calves were going too, which I've never had before. I'm curious if that's because I haven't ridden longer than four hours this year and this was at hour six or so." (https://thefeed.com/insider/gold-for-rollins-at-bwr-utah)

**Melisa Rollins [ELITE]:** "When I did get to that last climb of the day I had to walk. I tried to shift and it threw it into the spokes. I kept looking back, I was like, 'Where's Tiff? I know she's coming'. I made it to the top, never saw her, and the single track at the end really sealed the deal." (https://thefeed.com/insider/gold-for-rollins-at-bwr-utah)

**Lindsay Goldman [ELITE]:** "I was quickly realizing how evenly matched the two of us were on this day. Tiff and I traded pulls for the next 15 miles, the two of us adding and losing members of our group periodically. But unspoken, the two of us knew this race was between us." (https://puregravel.com/blogs/reviews/race-report-bwr-utah-2021)

**Lindsay Goldman [ELITE] on The Tolweg single-track:** "Goldman, on the other hand, had no idea what the rocks could do or would feel like, so she just rode them. That split-second decision and in portion naiveté solidified 2nd place for Goldman. As she exited the rocky section on a piece of brand new asphalt, she went into her tell-tale time trial mode and widened the gap." (https://puregravel.com/blogs/reviews/race-report-bwr-utah-2021)

**Unknown Rider [UNKNOWN]:** "BWR Utah is where my gravel journey began back in 2020 with a 9th-place finish. Since then I've added three more top-10s: 9th in 2022, 4th in 2023, 6th in 2024. And in 2025, it finally all came together as I achieved my long-term goal of winning this race." (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2jtN5LC32Q)

**Race Organizer Michael Marckx [ELITE perspective]:** "What's unique about that particular setting is we go through a few different types of terrain. Yeah there are gravel roads, but there's red hills and trees near Salt Lake City. Then you're back out onto the high desert and you get 10 miles of incredible rolling hills and gravel. Then, a bunch of sand and other stuff. Eventually we skirt the perimeter of one mountain. After mile 100, we climb into the mountains on the Zion side." (https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/september-legs-singletrack-bwr-utah-143428100.html)

**Michael Marckx [ELITE perspective]:** "We go into a mountain bike park for seven miles and wind our way through that on really flowy, nice, singletrack. With bridges and fun terrain stuff. Not long after that, we literally go onto a motocross course. We do the full motocross course and then get back out onto gravel roads." (https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/september-legs-singletrack-bwr-utah-143428100.html)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Tire Width - General [ALL LEVELS]:** The official race guidance advises riders to "equip their bikes with tires of at least 40mm in width" given the rugged terrain. (https://strambecco.com/event/belgian-waffle-ride-bwr-utah/)

**Tire Width Question [UNKNOWN LEVEL]:** One rider asked about running 34mm tires with knobs on a Specialized SL7 (spec'd at 32mm max) for BWR Utah, indicating the minimum recommended width may be challenging for some road-oriented bikes. (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/nja52x/bwr_utah_on_sl7/)

**Bike Setup - Melisa Rollins [ELITE]:** "I felt completely under-biked" on the technical single-track sections. Rollins rode a Felt Carbon Breed gravel bike with Kenda tires, SRAM components, Zipp wheels/bars/stem, Arundel cages, and Velo saddle. (https://thefeed.com/insider/gold-for-rollins-at-bwr-utah and https://www.endurancesportswire.com/virginias-blue-ridge-twenty24-melisa-rollins-wins-belgian-waffle-ride-utah/)

**MTB Skills Matter [ELITE perspective]:** Organizer noted: "I am a mountain biker, or at least I like to consider myself a mountain biker, and it is pretty technical terrain for a gravel race." (https://thefeed.com/insider/gold-for-rollins-at-bwr-utah)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**The Tolweg (Turnpuke) - Mile 116+ [ALL LEVELS]:** According to the official Race Bijbel: "a dirty, dastardly and diabolical sector 4.4-miles in length and twists and turns--sweeping and swooping--leaving riders weeping or whooping, depending on their single track skills and whatever energy they may have left... This definitive sector is a single track that contours Iron Hills, just above the valley floor, with its most prominent features being rocks, three dozen turns, boulders, junipers, sage brush, pines and more rocks." (https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/september-legs-singletrack-bwr-utah-143428100.html)

**Kanarra Mountain KOM/QOM - Mile 108 [ALL LEVELS]:** "Roughly three mile climb that averages 10 percent" with sections "upwards of 20 percent" on sandy dirt road. Multiple riders mentioned being forced to walk this climb. (https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/september-legs-singletrack-bwr-utah-143428100.html and https://strambecco.com/event/belgian-waffle-ride-bwr-utah/)

**Technical Rocky Section [ELITE experience]:** "As the riders entered a narrow canyon with rocks from one side to the other, Goldman rode the segment, and Franz opted to carry her bike and run. Franz being the more experienced dirt rider, knew the treachery of the rocks ahead, so she took a more conservative approach." (https://puregravel.com/blogs/reviews/race-report-bwr-utah-2021)

**Single-Track Extent [ALL LEVELS]:** The 2022 course featured "seven miles" of "really flowy, nice, singletrack" through a mountain bike park, plus a full motocross course section. (https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/september-legs-singletrack-bwr-utah-143428100.html)

**Course Evolution [ALL LEVELS]:** The 2026 route description notes it "removes technical single-track in favor of flowing dirt and gravel sections that reward power, skill, and strategy" with "dynamic array of rippable unroad spiciness (no crazy single-track this time)." This suggests the course has become less technical in recent years. (https://www.belgianwaffleride.bike/pages/utah)

**Wind Conditions [ALL LEVELS]:** Official race notes warn riders about "strong headwinds between miles 42 and 94." (https://strambecco.com/event/belgian-waffle-ride-bwr-utah/)

**2023 Course Stats - Waffle [ALL LEVELS]:** 128.1 miles with ~7,500 feet climbing, 92% "Unroad" terrain including sand, rocks, dirt, nine road sectors, cattle crossings, water crossings, and footbridges. (https://strambecco.com/event/belgian-waffle-ride-bwr-utah/)

**2025 Course Stats - Waffle [ALL LEVELS]:** 117 miles / 188 kilometers with 5,940 feet of climbing, ~60% unroad terrain, 8 road sectors. (https://www.belgianwaffleride.bike/pages/utah)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Early Race Positioning [ELITE - Melisa Rollins]:** "My main focus was to try to be present at the front because last year when I raced gravel, I always struggled with that... Once we kind of hit the main first climb where it usually blows up, I was able to hang. I was the last person to not make the lead men's group." After sitting up, she and another rider "ended up pulling back the pro men's group at mile 45…after 10 miles of dying." (https://thefeed.com/insider/gold-for-rollins-at-bwr-utah)

**Late-Race Drama [ELITE - Melisa Rollins]:** "We stayed together until mile 85 where we cruxed the penultimate climb of the day, and as we descended off that descent, Tiffany took the lead and she wiped out pretty hard. I was solo after that." This indicates the race often stays together deep into the event before selection happens. (https://thefeed.com/insider/gold-for-rollins-at-bwr-utah)

**Single-Track as Decisive Factor [ELITE]:** Multiple elite riders noted that technical skill on The Tolweg single-track (mile 116+) was race-decisive. As one report noted: "the single track at the end really sealed the deal" for separating riders. (https://thefeed.com/insider/gold-for-rollins-at-bwr-utah)

**Neutral Start [ALL LEVELS]:** All distances start together with a 4-mile neutral rollout before racing begins. (https://strambecco.com/event/belgian-waffle-ride-bwr-utah/)

## Nutrition & Fueling

**High Carb Strategy [ELITE - Melisa Rollins]:** "I switched over to high-carb fueling [in the bottles]. I used Skratch Superfuel and realized I was actually able to tolerate a lot more carbs an hour than I ever was doing before. I was doing 60g/hr before and when I started using the Superfuel I could get into 90-100 grams an hour pretty easily." For BWR Utah specifically: "I started out targeting 100-110 an hour in the first three hours, then I diluted the Skratch a little bit. I counted afterward how many carbs I ended up consuming an hour and it was ~120g/hr through a mix of Superfuel and high carb energy gels." (https://thefeed.com/insider/gold-for-rollins-at-bwr-utah)

**NOTE:** This 120g/hr fueling strategy is from an elite-level winner who finished in approximately 7-8 hours. Recreational riders with longer finish times will have different fueling needs and tolerances.

**Feed Zone Spacing [ALL LEVELS]:** Feed zones are "strategically placed every 20 miles, stocked with snacks, drinks, and, of course, those beloved Belgian waffles." The Waffle course has 4 feed zones, Wafer has 2, and Wanna has 1. (https://strambecco.com/event/belgian-waffle-ride-bwr-utah/ and https://www.belgianwaffleride.bike/pages/utah)

**Duration Challenge [ELITE - Melisa Rollins]:** "I actually was terrified for BWR because I haven't ridden longer than four hours this year, so I haven't been able to practice any kind of fueling strategy [for that length]... This was at hour six or so." Even elite riders noted the duration as a fueling challenge. (https://thefeed.com/insider/gold-for-rollins-at-bwr-utah)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Cramping Beyond Typical Duration [ELITE]:** Melisa Rollins experienced severe full-body cramping at mile 85+ (hour 6): "I instantly started cramping in both of my legs, both quads, both adductors, and my calves were going too, which I've never had before. I'm curious if that's because I haven't ridden longer than four hours this year." The cramping resolved when she could "put down some more power" on flat sections. (https://thefeed.com/insider/gold-for-rollins-at-bwr-utah)

**Mechanical - Derailleur Damage [ELITE]:** "I crashed in the single track and I bent my derailleur hanger, losing my easiest gears. [It] was fine for the most part because the course is pretty flat, except for the last climb at 110." Later: "When I did get to that last climb of the day I had to walk. I tried to shift and it threw it into the spokes." This mechanical issue forced walking on a critical late climb. (https://thefeed.com/insider/gold-for-rollins-at-bwr-utah)

**Crashes on Descents [ELITE]:** In the 2023 women's race, second-place contender Tiffany Cromwell "wiped out pretty hard" on the descent after mile 85, losing contact with the leader. (https://thefeed.com/insider/gold-for-rollins-at-bwr-utah)

**Flat Tires [ELITE]:** Elite rider Heidi Franz "was getting into difficulty. Her body language didn't read fatigue, but a slow leak to her front tire was taking her out the back" in the early race. (https://puregravel.com/blogs/reviews/race-report-bwr-utah-2021)

**Griffin Easter's 2021 Puncture [ELITE]:** "After what looked like a guaranteed sprint between he and Stetina last year, the 30-year-old punctured in the notorious Tolweg section." (https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/september-legs-singletrack-bwr-utah-143428100.html)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Local Support:** "Cedar City continues to welcome us with open arms, rolling out the red, yellow, and black carpet to host one of the most unique endurance weekends in the country." (https://www.belgianwaffleride.bike/pages/utah)

**Weekend Festival Vibe:** "The weekend kicks off with Friday's pre-race gathering—where riders, sponsors, and locals mingle over beer, banter, and pre-race nerves—and culminates in Saturday's full-throttle race and post-ride feast of waffles and Belgian ale." (https://www.belgianwaffleride.bike/pages/utah)

**Expo Scale:** "Over 50 exhibitors will showcase the latest in bikes, gear, and performance tech. Local food trucks, craft beer, and live music will fuel the good vibes." (https://www.belgianwaffleride.bike/pages/utah)

**Post-Race:** All finishers receive "Trophy Beer" and "Bragging Rights." The post-race includes "revealing the winner of the Canyon Bike/OpiCure bike giveaway and loads of Rouleur's signature Badass Ale." (https://strambecco.com/event/belgian-waffle-ride-bwr-utah/)

**Women's Start Success [ELITE perspective]:** Race reporter Joy McCulloch wrote: "It was a slam dunk. Without having to sift through the stifling dust as the sun rose to find the other riders who may be their competition, they were all standing on the grass together. A united group who would soon begin throwing watts at each other, but of their own volition—not because the men were riding harder into the headwind. The playing field had been leveled, and we soon would have a race on our hands." (https://puregravel.com/blogs/reviews/race-report-bwr-utah-2021)

**Equal Prize Money:** "Equal prize money is awarded across three categories (M/W/Gender Diverse), with the top three (or, in some races, the top five) from each category receiving prize money." (https://strambecco.com/event/belgian-waffle-ride-bwr-utah/)

**BWR Philosophy:** "These are not races set up for freeloading sprinters or frail climbers. They are designed to challenge riders of all stripes and sizes in demented and glorious ways. Therein lies the allure of the Monuments of Cycling: extreme challenges that require months or years of training, the right equipment, tenacity, and karma."
