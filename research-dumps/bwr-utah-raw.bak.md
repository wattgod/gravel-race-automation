# BWR UTAH - RAW RESEARCH DUMP

**OFFICIAL DATA**

*Note: After exhaustive searching, I cannot locate specific 2025/2026 dates, registration costs, field sizes, prize purses, or detailed logistics for BWR Utah. The Belgian Waffle Ride series appears to focus heavily on their California events, with limited publicly available information about the Utah edition.*

**TERRAIN & COURSE**

The official BWR website (belgianwaffleride.com) does not provide detailed course information for the Utah event. Without access to specific course maps or rider reports from this event, I cannot provide:
- Surface breakdown percentages
- Named climbs or sectors
- Technical difficulty ratings
- Detailed elevation profiles

**CLIMATE & CONDITIONS**

Cedar City, Utah elevation: 5,846 ft above sea level
The stated course elevation gain of 9,843 ft suggests significant climbing, likely reaching elevations above 8,000-9,000 ft.

Cedar City climate (per weather.gov data):
- Spring/fall temperatures: Highs 60-70°F, lows 30-40°F
- Summer temperatures: Highs 85-95°F
- Known for sudden weather changes
- High desert environment with low humidity

**LOGISTICS**

Cedar City Regional Airport: Limited commercial service
Nearest major airport: Las Vegas McCarran (LAS) - approximately 180 miles south
St. George Regional Airport (SGU) - approximately 50 miles southwest

**COMMUNITY & REPUTATION**

I cannot find:
- Founding year for BWR Utah specifically
- Past winners or results
- Rider reviews or forum discussions
- YouTube coverage specific to Utah event
- Community perception or reputation

**RACE REPORTS & RIDER EXPERIENCE**

No rider reports, equipment recommendations, DNF rates, or specific experiences could be located through web search.

**CONCLUSION**

After extensive web searching using multiple queries and search strategies, I was unable to find substantial information about BWR Utah. This appears to be either:
1. A very new or recently added event in the Belgian Waffle Ride series
2. An event that hasn't been widely covered or discussed online
3. Potentially a misnamed or unofficial event

The main Belgian Waffle Ride website (belgianwaffleride.com) focuses primarily on their San Diego and North Carolina events. I recommend contacting the race organizers directly through their website for specific information about the Utah event.
