# CAMP MICHAUX GRAVEL GRINDER — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Kathy Peters [UNKNOWN]:** "I raced in the half series and managed to place 3rd in the 60+ woman category -- right behind fellow BaseCamp Explore Team member Lynn Botelho. The race started with perfect weather after a long hot and humid streak in the east. However, by the afternoon the longer distance riders were feeling the heat and the big climbs were taking a toll." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/kathys-story-camp-michaux-gravel-grinder)

**Lynn Botelho [ELITE]:** "I was in the lead to about 3 miles out when Beth caught up to me at the entrance to the single track. We actually crashed. She took off with me on the ground. I do love descents and tough terrain. 😳 Caught up and passed her in a mud pit. But with 2 miles to go on the road and with a gentle incline, she attacked. I tried, but I had no more to give and she pulled away." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/lynns-story-camp-michaux-gravel-grinder)

**Lynn Botelho [ELITE]:** "I was sick in bed for a week and then I had a 16 days holiday in the UK. So with 2 weeks to prep, I did everything I knew how. Good food; no drink. Mini training camp over a long weekend. Good sleep. Solid work outs. Good rest." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/lynns-story-camp-michaux-gravel-grinder)

**Evan McGregor [ELITE]:** "Since attending the BaseCamp gravel camp in Michaux Forest back in October, I've really wanted to get to one of the races there... I was with the front of the race, until I realized I overspent and was unable to follow the front 5. I dialed things back and paced my effort. A bad cramp on Big Pond Hollow cost me a few minutes off the bike, but I was still able to salvage things with a sizable gap back to the riders behind me." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/evans-story-camp-michaux-gravel-grinder)

**Evan McGregor [ELITE]:** "A sidewall slash on my rear tire ended my ride. I didn't bring a tube and nothing was plugging that, though I tried for about 4 minutes. Being so close to the finish still in the top of the field was agonizing... so I picked up my bike and ran. The aptly named Birch Run Road served as my 4k running finale. With my bike in hand and cycling shoes on, I gave it what I had for the last 2.5 miles... Almost 25 minutes of running with a handful of riders passing me (including the AG winner) brought me to the line where I went flat out to the finish. I finished in second place by 12 seconds in my AG, and 10 minutes down on the category winner." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/evans-story-camp-michaux-gravel-grinder)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**[ELITE] Tire durability consideration:** Evan McGregor [ELITE] experienced a sidewall slash on the rear tire during single track near the end of the race. He attempted to plug it for 4 minutes unsuccessfully and noted he didn't bring a tube. This suggests carrying a tube as backup even if running tubeless, especially for riders attempting competitive times. (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/evans-story-camp-michaux-gravel-grinder)

**Skills training recommendation:** Evan McGregor [ELITE] noted that "The BaseCamp gravel camp in Michaux helped build the skills I needed for descending to no longer be a liability or outright weakness" and specifically credited Coach Nathan Goates. He mentioned he was "ripping along" on descents during the race. (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/evans-story-camp-michaux-gravel-grinder)

## Weather Experienced

**2025 race conditions:** The race "started with perfect weather after a long hot and humid streak in the east. However, by the afternoon the longer distance riders were feeling the heat and the big climbs were taking a toll." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/kathys-story-camp-michaux-gravel-grinder)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Single track section near finish:** Lynn Botelho [ELITE] describes encountering single track "about 3 miles out" from the finish where she and another rider crashed at the entrance. She then "caught up and passed her in a mud pit" before being dropped "with 2 miles to go on the road and with a gentle incline." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/lynns-story-camp-michaux-gravel-grinder)

**Big Pond Hollow:** Evan McGregor [ELITE] mentions this as a specific location where he experienced "a bad cramp" that "cost me a few minutes off the bike." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/evans-story-camp-michaux-gravel-grinder)

**Birch Run Road:** The final approach includes Birch Run Road, described as approximately 2.5 miles finishing on road. (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/evans-story-camp-michaux-gravel-grinder)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**[ELITE] Pacing mistake - going too hard early:** Evan McGregor [ELITE], coming off a 2-month injury layoff, noted: "Since it was my first race of the year, I had a lot of energy and excitement to let out, and I took that out on the pedals for the first hour of the race... I was with the front of the race, until I realized I overspent and was unable to follow the front 5. I dialed things back and paced my effort." This led to cramping later at Big Pond Hollow. (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/evans-story-camp-michaux-gravel-grinder)

**[ELITE] Late-race tactics:** Lynn Botelho [ELITE] describes being caught with 3 miles to go and having another rider "attack" on a gentle incline with 2 miles remaining. She "tried, but I had no more to give and she pulled away," suggesting the final 2-3 miles on road present an opportunity for stronger riders to distance competitors. (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/lynns-story-camp-michaux-gravel-grinder)

**[ELITE] Short prep recovery protocol:** Lynn Botelho [ELITE] successfully raced with only 2 weeks of focused prep after being "sick in bed for a week" and having "a 16 days holiday in the UK" by focusing on: "Good food; no drink. Mini training camp over a long weekend. Good sleep. Solid work outs. Good rest." She finished 2nd in her age group within 2 minutes of 1st.

## DNF Risk Factors

**Sidewall slashes in single track:** Evan McGregor [ELITE] suffered a race-ending sidewall slash "on a bit of single track near the end" that couldn't be plugged.

**Cramping on climbs:** Evan McGregor [ELITE] experienced "a bad cramp on Big Pond Hollow" that cost him "a few minutes off the bike," indicating the climbs can trigger cramping issues, especially if pacing is aggressive early. (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/evans-story-camp-michaux-gravel-grinder)

**Heat in afternoon for longer courses:** Race reports note that "by the afternoon the longer distance riders were feeling the heat and the big climbs were taking a toll" in 2025. (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/kathys-story-camp-michaux-gravel-grinder)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**BaseCamp team presence:** Multiple BaseCamp Explore Team members participated, with Kathy Peters noting: "Had the opportunity to meet lots of other BaseCampers at the recent Camp Michaux Gravel Grinder." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/kathys-story-camp-michaux-gravel-grinder)

**Family-friendly finish atmosphere:** Evan McGregor [ELITE] describes collapsing "just past the finish line with my wife and kids cheering me on. Supporting me. They're the reason I race. They're the reason I don't give up... I want to show my family what these mean. I want them to be proud." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/evans-story-camp-michaux-gravel-grinder)

**Competitive age group racing:** Lynn Botelho [ELITE] describes an ongoing series rivalry: "Lynn has 2 age group firsts; Beth 1. Each of us was second to the other. Let's see what Mid States (PA) brings!... The end result is a great series race for the summer!" This indicates tight competition in age group categories across the Pennsylvania Gravel Series. (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/lynns-story-camp-michaux-gravel-grinder)
