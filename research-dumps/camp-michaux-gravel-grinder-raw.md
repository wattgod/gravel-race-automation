## DATA GAPS & CLARIFICATIONS

**Location Discrepancy:** Your provided location "Gardners, Pennsylvania" differs from the search results, which show two different venue locations:
- 2025 Michaux GRVL: 101 Pine Grove Rd, Caledonia State Park (Fayetteville, PA)[4]
- 2026 Camp Michaux Gravel Grinder: 1975 Birch Run Road, Biglerville, PA[2]

Neither is Gardners, PA. These appear to be two separate events under different organizations (Franklin County Cyclists vs. Trans-Sylvania Productions).

**Information Not Found:** The search results do not contain comprehensive data on registration fees, field size, detailed course descriptions, technical difficulty ratings, historical race reports, rider reviews, YouTube coverage, or community reputation assessments. Additional targeted searches would be required to complete those sections.
