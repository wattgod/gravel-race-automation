# CANMORE CRUX — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Event Format & Course Evolution

**Major Format Change for 2026:**
The race is "evolving into a 4-hour AMLAP (As Many Laps As Possible) showdown" with a "brand-new 16 KM loop that blends smooth pavement with crunchy gravel." The course is described as "smoother and more approachable than ever, but don't get too comfortable - the 4-hour clock is relentless." Riders can compete "Solo or teaming up as a Duo" and "if you're riding solo and decide you've had your fill before the four hours are up, no problem - throw in the towel whenever you're ready." (https://www.canmorecrux.com/)

**Previous Format (2024-2025):**
The race previously offered two fixed distances: "80km & 32km distances" with "Mass start at 9:00 AM for both the 80km and 32km events" and "Event wrapped up for the day around 2:30PM." The course was a "5 Lap Bike Course" with approximately "1,800 ELEVATION GAIN" for the 83km version.

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**2024-2025 Course Trails:**
The 5-lap course used specific double-track trails including: "Olympic, Meadowview, Silvertip, Banff, Bow, Grey Wolf Lower, Banff Loop, Coyote" (https://www.albertaparks.ca/parks/kananaskis/canmore-nordic-centre-pp/events/events/canmore-crux-2025/)

**2026 Course Character:**
The new 16km loop "blends fast pavement with scenic gravel" and is characterized as having "easier terrain" that is "faster" than previous years, though organizers warn "Don't let the 'easier' terrain fool you - while the course is faster, the 4-hour clock is relentless." (https://www.canmorecrux.com/)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Bike Type Flexibility [ALL LEVELS]:**
The organizers explicitly welcome bike variety: "No gravel bike? No sweat. We love mountain bikes, 'Franken-bikes,' and whatever rig makes you feel confident on the climbs and gravel. Bring the bike you trust and a thirst for adventure." (https://www.canmorecrux.com/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**2026 AMLAP Strategy Considerations [ALL LEVELS]:**
The race description notes: "Whether you're hunting for a personal best or just here for the mountain air, the challenge is exactly as big as you make it - throw in the towel after your first lap if that is all you have in the tank." This suggests a self-paced approach where riders determine their own suffering threshold within the 4-hour window. (https://www.canmorecrux.com/)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Event Philosophy:**
The race positioning emphasizes inclusivity and shared suffering: "Out here, the struggle is our shared language, and everyone is invited to the conversation" with "No judgment, just high-fives at the finish." It's marketed as "your wake-up call, your season opener" and potentially "the most stunningly brutal and beautiful day you'll have on two wheels all year." (https://www.canmorecrux.com/)

**Event Size:**
Approximately 200 participants with registration capped at 250 for 2026. Registration "closes on June 3, 2026 (or as soon as we sell-out)."
