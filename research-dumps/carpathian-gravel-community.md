# CARPATHIAN GRAVEL — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Cory Wallace [COMPETITIVE]:** "My body was in shock as I tried to push over a 36 T-45 gearing. I was ready to walk but my buddy Fred was just behind me and my manly hood wouldn't let me get off the bike. Thus I grinded the gears over at the slowest rpm possible. By the finish line I was cracked and stunned as it's only once every 5 or 6 years that a 36-45 gearing will let me down but apparently racing in Romania was going to be an exception."

**Cory Wallace [COMPETITIVE]:** "Stage 2 was pretty short mileage wise but a real hardmans day. Somehow they packed 3300 climbing meters into 59 km, and it had more hike a bike then you could shake a stick at... The decent went in a straight line, through the rhubarb and grass down the mountain. It seemed whoever flagged the course just set there GPS on a straight line down the mountain and then started hanging flags up." (http://corywallace.com/2018/08/romanian-adventures-the-carpathian-mtb-epic/)

**Cory Wallace [COMPETITIVE]:** "Mid race I could see my buddy Fred about 3 minutes ahead, straight up this huge hike a bike section. After spending last winter hiking around the Himalayas I used these hike-a-bikes to my advantage and caught a few riders... This turned into one of the best 30 minutes of riding I had all year as we pushed each other, passing riders, and getting ourselves back into the race. It was sketchy in sections, dodging sharp rocks, skidding down wet grassy slopes, and bouncing off tree roots in the forest below." (http://corywallace.com/2018/08/romanian-adventures-the-carpathian-mtb-epic/)

**Max Moyles [UNKNOWN]:** "I made the mistake of assuming it [homemade schnapps] was a drink to 'noroc' and drink in one, but oh boy was I wrong! After a truly throat burning experience I was just glad to keep it down." (https://gloriousgravel.com/blog/offroading-transylvania/)

**Max Moyles [UNKNOWN]:** "One feature of the local countryside are dogs. Local farmers usually have a group of dogs protecting their cattle from the few bears which inhabit Romania, the dogs are pretty much harmless but they do like to bark. We found the best way to deal with them was to hop off your bike and walk past, it was a slight pain but something you quickly get used to." (https://gloriousgravel.com/blog/offroading-transylvania/)

**Chris Marton [UNKNOWN]:** "I turned off the road and down a rough track leading to what I hoped would be a comfy flat, patch of grass I could hide away in for the night. The dog must have heard me rattling along the track and appeared in an instant to block my way, barking and braying but standing its ground. I wasn't going to argue with this guy or his feisty beagle friend that was a fifth of his size but almost as loud." (https://alpkit.com/blogs/deeds/battling-the-elements-cycling-through-the-romanian-carpathians)

**Chris Marton [UNKNOWN]:** "Waking early to a thick covering of snow. My bidons had frozen in the night. I'd filled them with sparkling water i'd mistakenly bought the previous evening so the pressure had built, opened the mouth piece and leaked an icicle which sealed down the lid." (https://alpkit.com/blogs/deeds/battling-the-elements-cycling-through-the-romanian-carpathians)

**Andrei (age 29) [ELITE]:** "My initial short rides quickly escalated into epic fixed-gear bikepacking adventures, fostering a love for endurance and self-sufficiency. This led naturally to gravel riding, opening up access to the wilder parts of Romania... I cycled thousands of kilometres, a few that are worth mentioning are completing three gruelling 500km rides from the heart of Romania to the Black Sea." (https://usa.cinelli-milano.com/blogs/news/how-we-first-met-andrei-and-his-nemo-gravel)

**Marcin Stoch [RECREATIONAL]:** "After heavy rains you can award this course [Lemkivska Kobiouka] an extra point on the difficulty scale." (https://bikepacking.com/routes/lemkivska-kobiouka/)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Gearing [COMPETITIVE]:** Cory Wallace's experience shows that **36T-45T gearing was insufficient** for the Carpathian MTB Epic's steep gradients. He mentions it was "only once every 5 or 6 years that a 36-45 gearing will let me down." After the prologue, he unsuccessfully searched for smaller chainrings but local teams were unwilling to sell or loan them. The lesson: "Apparently when you race in Eastern Europe you better show up with everything you need as spare parts are sparse." (http://corywallace.com/2018/08/romanian-adventures-the-carpathian-mtb-epic/)

**Bike Choice [ELITE]:** Andrei chose the Cinelli Nemo TIG Gravel for its "classic geometry, the balance of comfort and performance offered by the steel frame and carbon components, and the generous tire clearance" to handle "diverse terrain of the Romanian mountains." (https://usa.cinelli-milano.com/blogs/news/how-we-first-met-andrei-and-his-nemo-gravel)

**Bike Suitability [UNKNOWN]:** CarpatBike's Gravel Grinder Weekend states routes are "suitable for gravel but also mountain bikes, depending on your riding style and bike preference" with "XC bicycles, Ebikes and gravel bikes are available." (https://www.carpatbike.ro/tour/carpathian-gravel-grinder-weekend/)

**Maintenance Skills [ELITE]:** Andrei emphasizes: "Being prepared for mechanical issues in remote locations is crucial, so I learned basic bike maintenance and carried essential tools. I experienced my share of roadside repairs, which taught me resourcefulness." (https://usa.cinelli-milano.com/blogs/news/how-we-first-met-andrei-and-his-nemo-gravel)

## Weather Experienced

**Winter Conditions (Date Unknown) [UNKNOWN]:** Chris Marton encountered unexpected winter weather despite it being "the beginning of spring." He experienced "a very wet border crossing from Hungary," followed by snow falling overnight. The next morning: "Snow fell overnight but the roads and sky were clear when I woke... By the late afternoon the snow clouds were building ahead." He woke to "a thick covering of snow" and frozen water bottles. (https://alpkit.com/blogs/deeds/battling-the-elements-cycling-through-the-romanian-carpathians)

**August Conditions [UNKNOWN]:** Max Moyles rode "In the hazy days of August" and experienced "golden hour" lighting during their final ride. (https://gloriousgravel.com/blog/offroading-transylvania/)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Singletrack Quality [UNKNOWN]:** Max Moyles describes a 40km section: "Personally as a gravel cyclist, whenever someone mentions a section of singletrack it throws my mind back to being chucked down a 'gravel' descent in the peak district. Fortunately Ionut pulled through and it seemed like this 40km section of singletrack had been made specifically for gravel cyclists, fast, flowing and some of the most fun I'd ever had on a bike." (https://gloriousgravel.com/blog/offroading-transylvania/)

**Descent Characteristics [COMPETITIVE]:** Cory Wallace describes a technical descent: "This turned into one of the best 30 minutes of riding I had all year... It was sketchy in sections, dodging sharp rocks, skidding down wet grassy slopes, and bouncing off tree roots in the forest below. By the bottom of this Romanian Enduro we had moved ourselves back into the top 15." However, another descent was described differently: "the decent went in a straight line, through the rhubarb and grass down the mountain... it eventually turned into a skid trail and near the bottom a skid trail with boulders littered all over. All in all it took 12 minutes to go down what had taken over 1hr and 15 minutes to climb with much of it being at -30-47%. My arms burned at the bottom and my brakes were likely melted into the rotors." (http://corywallace.com/2018/08/romanian-adventures-the-carpathian-mtb-epic/)

**Road Surface [UNKNOWN]:** Max Moyles notes: "The day started on perfect gravel tracks (one of the reasons you should get to Romania ASAP is that these tracks are slowly turning into roads, Romania has one of the lowest percentage of paved roads in Europe and as they look to change this their perfect gravel tracks are slowly disappearing)." (https://gloriousgravel.com/blog/offroading-transylvania/)

**Hike-a-Bike [COMPETITIVE]:** Cory Wallace: "Stage 2 was pretty short mileage wise but a real hardmans day. Somehow they packed 3300 climbing meters into 59 km, and it had more hike a bike then you could shake a stick at." (http://corywallace.com/2018/08/romanian-adventures-the-carpathian-mtb-epic/)

**Terrain Composition [UNKNOWN]:** CarpatBike describes their routes: "60% of the riding is on forest and off road paths, 30% is on quiet roads with little traffic, and 10% on roads shared with traffic." (https://www.carpatbike.ro/tour/carpathian-gravel-grinder-weekend/)

**River Crossings [RECREATIONAL]:** On the Lemkivska Kobiouka route: "The route crosses multiple rivers and soggy meadows, most of which are rideable, but there are places that involve bike portage." (https://bikepacking.com/routes/lemkivska-kobiouka/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Climbing Approach [COMPETITIVE]:** Cory Wallace describes his training-focused strategy: "Luke Way at Balance Point Racing has been giving me coaching guidance for years and after the last visit he told me to work on my slow cadence efforts to really put some stress on the leg muscles to lower the blood oxidation levels. I took the steep climbs at the Carpathian Epic as the perfect spot to practice this, but it also took its toll as I would push the low gears way past my limits and after 2 hours of this I had detonated my legs." (http://corywallace.com/2018/08/romanian-adventures-the-carpathian-mtb-epic/)

**Recovery Strategy [COMPETITIVE]:** After a hard stage, Cory Wallace "was all geared up to make some spots back up on the descent" but the challenging terrain put his "body in shutdown mode, likely from going over my limit trying to grind up the last 2 mountains with no ability to spin with the big gears." (http://corywallace.com/2018/08/romanian-adventures-the-carpathian-mtb-epic/)

**Mental Approach [COMPETITIVE]:** Cory Wallace on managing low points: "It's amazing how fast the mind can switch during a race, being on the edge of a complete breakdown, to making small gains and getting the momentum back in your favour." (http://corywallace.com/2018/08/romanian-adventures-the-carpathian-mtb-epic/)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Gearing Inadequacy [COMPETITIVE]:** Under-gearing for the steep climbs was a significant challenge. Cory Wallace nearly walked several climbs due to having only 36T-45T gearing, and the inability to source smaller chainrings locally could be race-ending. (http://corywallace.com/2018/08/romanian-adventures-the-carpathian-mtb-epic/)

**Physical Breakdown [COMPETITIVE]:** Cory Wallace experienced multiple "meltdowns" and mentions being "cracked and stunned" after the prologue, then having "full meltdown as my back was unhappy and the legs were even more unhappy," and later his body going into "shutdown mode." (http://corywallace.com/2018/08/romanian-adventures-the-carpathian-mtb-epic/)

**Wildlife Encounters [ELITE]:** Andrei mentions "Wildlife encounters, including bears, sheep dogs and wild boars, add excitement, but require awareness." (https://usa.cinelli-milano.com/blogs/news/how-we-first-met-andrei-and-his-nemo-gravel)

**Mechanical Issues [ELITE]:** Andrei emphasizes the risk: "Being prepared for mechanical issues in remote locations is crucial" and notes the importance of self-sufficiency in areas where help may not be available. (https://usa.cinelli-milano.com/blogs/news/how-we-first-met-andrei-and-his-nemo-gravel)

**Weather [UNKNOWN]:** Chris Marton's experience with unexpected snow and frozen water bottles demonstrates how rapidly changing mountain weather can create serious challenges. (https://alpkit.com/blogs/deeds/battling-the-elements-cycling-through-the-romanian-carpathians)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Local Hospitality [COMPETITIVE]:** Cory Wallace notes mixed experiences with locals. He describes warm welcomes: "Thankfully the locals were warm and welcoming, opening the gate and letting us cross through there pastures." However, accommodation had issues: "A Romanian 4 star resort is a little different then a Canadian 4 star resort... we also had one giant street light and one spotlight shining straight into our room." He notes philosophical acceptance: "I'm use to sleeping in a tent in a ditch somewhere so I could really care less about this stuff." (http://corywallace.com/2018/08/romanian-adventures-the-carpathian-mtb-epic/)

**Cultural Experiences [UNKNOWN]:** Max Moyles had memorable cultural encounters: "We had the chance to explore one of the local fortified churches and find out why they exist all across the country" and met "the local mayor of Viscri to discuss cycling in the region" followed by traditional food and homemade wine. He concludes: "the people we met, the unique culture we experienced and the general feeling that we had explored a unique area in the world and that's not even mentioning the amazing riding. If anyone has the chance to visit Romania, take it with both hands!" (https://gloriousgravel.com/blog/offroading-transylvania/)

**Food Experience [COMPETITIVE]:** Cory Wallace describes post-race meals: "we headed up to the restaurant for a big Romanian buffet full of all sorts of meat, delicious cheeses, potatoes, cabbage, and a few other white starches. Apparently they don't like eating green things too much over there but we certainly had our fill of heavy proteins and Carbs. It reminded me a bit of the Mongolian cuisine." (http://corywallace.com/2018/08/romanian-adventures-the-carpathian-mtb-epic/)

**Military Presence [UNKNOWN]:** Max Moyles had an unusual encounter: "As we got closer we started to hear fighter jets, a few explosions and we started to wonder how close our route would be taking us to the action. As it turns out, extremely. As we climbed up a small climb on to the ridge we were soon met by a few members of the Romanian military, fortunately they were incredibly friendly and pointed us in the right direction. The whole experience is a very real reminder of the war being fought not too far away in Ukraine." (https://gloriousgravel.com/blog/offroading-transylvania/)

**Historical Context [RECREATIONAL]:** The Lemkivska Kobiouka route was "created to showcase the natural beauty of the Low Beskid Mountains, as well as to pay tribute to the Lemko people and to keep the memory of their unique cultural heritage alive." The region features "wooden 'Doors to forgotten world,' an art project by Natalia Hładyk, a reminder of nonexistent Lemko villages" and an "Open-air Museum of Lemko Culture in Zyndranowa." (https://bikepacking.com/routes/lemkivska-kobiouka/)

**Rural Authentic Experience [ELITE]:** Andrei describes the appeal: "My favorite place to ride is the Sunset Mountains that are part of the Carpathian range, which I crossed twice. I am drawn to their untouched beauty, dramatic landscapes, and sense of remoteness. The Sunset Mountains offer a sensory experience, a place to disconnect and reconnect with nature, where time slows down and I truly feel alive."
