# CASTELLON GRAVEL RACE — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Jorge Padrones [COMPETITIVE]:** "The race was not a walk in the park. Castellon is the second most mountainous region in Spain, something you don't realise until you arrive in Llucena, the starting point, and see big mountains around you as the only exit from the village. It means we knew we will have to climb during the race - more than 2600 meters of elevation to be exact in 97 km." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-uci-gravel-world-series-castellon)

**Jorge Padrones [COMPETITIVE]:** "This was not a very technically demanding race, if we can say that descending a gravel path at 65 km/h with some sharp corners is not technical! What I mean is that there are no singletrack or rocky sections to pass. It was a fast course, with a good surface in which the first flew at more than 25 km/h average." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-uci-gravel-world-series-castellon)

**Jorge Padrones [COMPETITIVE]:** "I want to give a big shout out for the organisation of this Castellon Gravel World race as it was flawlessly organised making it a real party in all senses. It has all the ingredients to be considered as a reference gravel event in Europe - good weather, good course and good organisation."
