**Ride Director Brooke Nelson [UNKNOWN]:** "The pandemic has made all of us so ready and so thankful to have something to do." (https://www.granfondoguide.com/Contents/Index/6093/cheaha-challenge-draws-record-numbers-this-year)

**Ride Director Brooke Nelson [UNKNOWN]:** "This year's registration had been record-breaking, and a sign that cyclists are no less excited to get outside after a year of pandemic lockdown. The race group began hosting UCI time trials in 2019 and had about 80 registrants, she said, but this year there were 154 cyclists to register for the event. The Cheaha Challenge, meanwhile, had already broken its registration record as of Friday afternoon, with more than 1,300 people planning to participate in the Sunday race."

**Mike Vickers (past president and ride founder) [UNKNOWN]:** Original vision described as riding "from Piedmont down Highway 9 up the scenic drive over Cheaha Mountain to Adam's Gap and back." The first response from a colleague was: "Who in the world would want to do that?" Mike convinced people that "if we did it – if we established this ride to the top of the highest point in our state on a scenic drive along the world's oldest mountain chain – that people would come and ride it."
