## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**U23 Rider (Los Gatos Bicycle Racing Club) [ELITE]:** "The start was like a traditional xco, except with riders 15 wide as we sprinted for position. Although the trail stayed wide for the first 15 miles of the race, the grass was thick and there was a single burned in line that everyone was fighting for... The rollers created a yo-yo effect where the group would bunch up on the uphills and string out on the downhills, making it hard just to stay in the peloton." (https://www.losgatosbicycleracing.org/race-report-chequamegon-mtb-festival/)

**U23 Rider (Los Gatos Bicycle Racing Club) [ELITE]:** "I spun out my 34T and couldn't compete in the final sprint... my average heart rate was 191 bpm for the full 2hr race, and I had nothing left at the finish." (https://www.losgatosbicycleracing.org/race-report-chequamegon-mtb-festival/)

**Melisa Rollins [ELITE]:** "We were a pretty big group coming through the first feed zone and I tried to stay patient. The race blew up at mile 25 on the Firetower climb and I was feeling really good. I got a little gap over the top of it but wasn't able to hold it. I got caught by three riders and then went again shortly after and knew that I was holding my momentum really well, and managed to hold them off until the finish." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/news/rollins-vermeulen-take-chequamegon/)

**Melisa Rollins [ELITE]:** "Chequamegon has been my big focus since Leadville so I haven't really thought about Little and Big Sugar yet. I like to take things race by race but I know I want to show up at those two races the best I can and I'm excited to be part of the fight for the overall win. It's going to be a really close and tough battle for the top spot." (https://www.cyclingwest.com/racing/mountain-bike-racing/chequamegon-rollins-and-vermeulen-strike-solo-in-cable/)

**Alexey Vermeulen [ELITE]:** "I started trying to make my moves with around seven miles to go. I could see the group was splintering, and guys were chasing to regain contact, and I knew the rubber band would eventually snap and gaps would start to open up. So I just bided my time." (https://www.cyclingwest.com/racing/mountain-bike-racing/chequamegon-rollins-and-vermeulen-strike-solo-in-cable/)

**Alexey Vermeulen [ELITE]:** "I could tell that anybody who got on my wheel wasn't willing to work, and it was still quite a long way to the finish. I didn't think anybody could go solo initially, but in the end I just trusted myself, saw the gap happen, and just committed. Once you commit you just have to believe in yourself because if it comes back, they're going to beat you in the sprint." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/news/rollins-vermeulen-take-chequamegon/)

**Alexey Vermeulen [ELITE]:** "I have a special feeling towards this race. It was a dog fight the whole time. Everyone was all in. Things played out in my favor but I bet there were ten guys who could have won that sprint... I knew [the sprint] was going to be fast. Everyone would be spun out. In the end it came down to who could pedal the fastest." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/alexey-vermeulen-and-ruth-edwards-win-life-time-chequamegon-mtb-festival/)

**Cobe Freeburn (Durango) [ELITE]:** "It was fun. I was not really sure what to expect; I've never done it before. It was a fun race that was nice and tactical, fast and punchy. I didn't really know what to expect going into it so I'm really happy to end up on the podium." (https://www.durangoherald.com/articles/freeburn-holcomb-mcelveen-finish-inside-top-10-at-chequamegon/)

**Cobe Freeburn [ELITE]:** "Last year, I lost almost every sprint I did. I was just trying to position well, mostly, and then I had a good idea of timing where a good place to sprint was. I really surprised myself there; it helped that it was such a hard race overall that all the other guys in the front were pretty tired. I was a tiny bit less tired than they were and I kind of timed things well." (https://www.durangoherald.com/articles/freeburn-holcomb-mcelveen-finish-inside-top-10-at-chequamegon/)

**Ruth Holcomb (Durango) [ELITE]:** "It was good. I knew it was going to be good one for me, because it's a little more what I'm used to, a little more like a normal cross-country race. I was definitely excited and it's a little flatter and I'm better when it's punchy like that... I definitely was hoping for maybe a little bit more. But, it's also a pretty tricky race that you have to know how to race." (https://www.durangoherald.com/articles/freeburn-holcomb-mcelveen-finish-inside-top-10-at-chequamegon/)

**Ruth Holcomb [ELITE]:** "At almost every other race, you climb up a big hill, then you go down the descent and you get to rest down the descent. While the hill is hard, you get full recovery. There's really no place for full recovery in this race. Having the race only be only two hours, the pace is just higher and everyone's attacking the whole time." (https://www.durangoherald.com/articles/freeburn-holcomb-mcelveen-finish-inside-top-10-at-chequamegon/)

**Russell Finsterwald [ELITE]:** "Relentless. Chequamegon is the shortest race in the Grand Prix but it's one of the most difficult." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/alexey-vermeulen-and-ruth-edwards-win-life-time-chequamegon-mtb-festival/)

**Ruth Edwards [ELITE]:** "I really wanted Alexis to lead but she kind of made me lead. I was definitely in too hard of a gear and she was coming up behind me and really almost got it... It's a little bit shit to have a confusing [finish] line." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/alexey-vermeulen-and-ruth-edwards-win-life-time-chequamegon-mtb-festival/)

**Payson McElveen [ELITE]:** "The race was as tight and aggressive as ever, and I did my best with what I had on the day. A top 10 in another crazy tight mass finish, which was good enough to move a little further up the leaderboard." (https://www.durangoherald.com/articles/freeburn-holcomb-mcelveen-finish-inside-top-10-at-chequamegon/)

**Ruby Ryan (Durango) [COMPETITIVE]:** "I'm a bit bummed; I'm just more so frustrated with myself. I had a really good start to the day, I was sitting in the top-15 group, top-10 group and I made the crucial split, which I knew you had to and I felt good. Then unfortunately, another crucial split that I didn't really realize I missed..." (https://www.durangoherald.com/articles/freeburn-holcomb-mcelveen-finish-inside-top-10-at-chequamegon/)

**Hungry Bear Gravel 2024 Racer [UNKNOWN]:** "Loved the celebration zone at the finish and how you included the local business in the event. It had a great small-town community feel." (https://hungrybeargravel.com/information)

**Hungry Bear Gravel 2024 Racer [UNKNOWN]:** "The after party vibe with music was great. People just hung around and chilled more than I've seen at the other races I've done. Please don't change the post race vibe. :-)." (https://hungrybeargravel.com/information)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**[ELITE] - Bike Choice:** Cobe Freeburn used "a regular flat bar mountain bike at Chequamegon. He wanted to keep it simple with what he knows he's good on." (https://www.durangoherald.com/articles/freeburn-holcomb-mcelveen-finish-inside-top-10-at-chequamegon/)

**[UNKNOWN] - Rigid vs. Suspension Fork Question:** A 2019 Reddit user asked about doing the race on a 2007 Kona Jake the Snake (cyclocross bike with rigid fork), specifically questioning whether rigid or suspension fork was better for Chequamegon 40. No definitive community answer was provided in the sources. (https://www.reddit.com/r/MTB/comments/arx6bm/has_anyone_here_done_the_chequamegon_40/)

**Official Rule - No Aero Bars:** "We understand that aero bars have been seen at this event in the past, but our official stance is that the use of them is prohibited.

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Course Surface:** "The trail stayed wide for the first 15 miles of the race, the grass was thick and there was a single burned in line that everyone was fighting for." (https://www.losgatosbicycleracing.org/race-report-chequamegon-mtb-festival/)

**Rollers Effect:** "The rollers created a yo-yo effect where the group would bunch up on the uphills and string out on the downhills, making it hard just to stay in the peloton." (https://www.losgatosbicycleracing.org/race-report-chequamegon-mtb-festival/)

**Key Climb - Firetower:** The Firetower climb at approximately mile 25 is where the women's race typically breaks apart. Melisa Rollins made her decisive move here in 2025. The climb was described as involving "an all-out 3 minute effort" by the U23 rider. (https://www.losgatosbicycleracing.org/race-report-chequamegon-mtb-festival/, https://velo.outsideonline.com/news/rollins-vermeulen-take-chequamegon/)

**Course Profile:** "This 40-mile race traverses the famed Birkie Ski trail, forest roads, and snowmobile routes" with "over 3000ft of elevation gain over a ripping fast 2hr race." (https://www.losgatosbicycleracing.org/race-report-chequamegon-mtb-festival/, https://www.cheqmtb.com/chequamegon-40/)

**Final 2 Miles:** "The finish was a 2-mile long straightaway of grass rollers, gradually downhill to the line." (https://www.losgatosbicycleracing.org/race-report-chequamegon-mtb-festival/)

**No Recovery Zones:** Unlike traditional mountain bike races with climbs followed by descents, "there's really no place for full recovery in this race" due to constant rolling terrain. (https://www.durangoherald.com/articles/freeburn-holcomb-mcelveen-finish-inside-top-10-at-chequamegon/)

**Tighter Sections:** "There were some tighter sections of the course which split the front group up" despite the generally wide trails. (https://www.durangoherald.com/articles/freeburn-holcomb-mcelveen-finish-inside-top-10-at-chequamegon/)

**Muddy/Rocky Sections:** U23 rider "led through most of the muddy and rocky sections to pick my lines and help the group make it through smoothly." (https://www.losgatosbicycleracing.org/race-report-chequamegon-mtb-festival/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**[ELITE] - Start Positioning Critical:** "The start was like a traditional xco, except with riders 15 wide as we sprinted for position" - early positioning matters due to the single fast line through thick grass in the first 15 miles. (https://www.losgatosbicycleracing.org/race-report-chequamegon-mtb-festival/)

**[ELITE] - Yo-Yo Effect Management:** Elite riders experienced repeated 700w accelerations as the group bunched and strung out over rollers. "I found myself pinned as I tried to hold on to 700w accelerations over and over again." (https://www.losgatosbicycleracing.org/race-report-chequamegon-mtb-festival/)

**[ELITE] - Patience Strategy:** Multiple elite riders emphasized staying patient early. Melisa Rollins: "I tried to stay patient" through the first feed zone before the race broke apart at mile 25. (https://velo.outsideonline.com/news/rollins-vermeulen-take-chequamegon/)

**[ELITE] - Momentum Management:** "I tried to ride consistently and focused on carrying momentum down the short descents to fly up the rollers." (https://www.losgatosbicycleracing.org/race-report-chequamegon-mtb-festival/)

**[ELITE] - Timing of Attacks:** Alexey Vermeulen waited until "around seven miles to go" to start making moves, then committed to his final attack with about 3 miles remaining. (https://www.cyclingwest.com/racing/mountain-bike-racing/chequamegon-rollins-and-vermeulen-strike-solo-in-cable/)

**[ELITE] - Sprint Positioning:** Cobe Freeburn: "I was just trying to position well, mostly, and then I had a good idea of timing where a good place to sprint was." Sprint success came from being "a tiny bit less tired" than competitors after the hard race. (https://www.durangoherald.com/articles/freeburn-holcomb-mcelveen-finish-inside-top-10-at-chequamegon/)

**[ELITE] - Firetower Climb as Key Moment:** For those targeting a win or podium, the Firetower climb at mile 25 is the primary opportunity to make a decisive move. (https://www.losgatosbicycleracing.org/race-report-chequamegon-mtb-festival/)

**[RECREATIONAL/COMPETITIVE] - Crucial Splits:** Ruby Ryan noted missing "a crucial split that I didn't really realize" - suggesting awareness of group formations is important even for non-elite riders. (https://www.durangoherald.com/articles/freeburn-holcomb-mcelveen-finish-inside-top-10-at-chequamegon/)

**[ELITE] - Energy Management:** Cobe Freeburn enjoyed races this distance "because he doesn't have to worry about eating and overall, there's less to manage" compared to longer events. (https://www.durangoherald.com/articles/freeburn-holcomb-mcelveen-finish-inside-top-10-at-chequamegon/)
