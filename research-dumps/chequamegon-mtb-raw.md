## TERRAIN & COURSE

### Course Overview (Chequamegon 40)
The race traverses multiple terrain types through the Northwoods:

**Terrain Mix:**
- American Birkebeiner Ski Trail (grassy, wide paths with rolling hills)
- Forest roads
- Snowmobile trails
- Fire roads
- ATV trails
- Some smooth singletrack
- Wooded paths in Sawyer and Bayfield counties

### Terrain Breakdown (Approximate)
- **Birkie Trail:** Wide (30-foot) grassy ski trail with rolling hills - majority of course
- **Fire Roads:** Fast gravel sections
- **Doubletrack:** Forest service roads
- **Singletrack:** Limited, smooth sections - NOT technical switchbacks
- **Gravel Roads:** Fast pavement-to-gravel transitions

### Elevation Profile

**Total Climbing:** 2,500-3,000+ feet (varies by measurement method and course modifications)

**Key Climbs:**
1. **Seeley Fire Tower Climb** (Mile ~28.5, 11.5 miles from finish)
   - The pivotal point of the race
   - Steep and technical requiring good traction
   - Usually clogged with people walking if not in first 100 riders
   - "Knockout punch" - elevation gained then lost

2. **High Point on Birkie Trail** (7 miles from finish)
   - "Yet another knockout punch"
   - Climb back after losing Fire Tower elevation

**Course Character:**
- "Long and fast" - leaders average nearly 20 MPH
- "Never ending profile fluctuations wear down even the fittest participants"
- "Roller coaster ride" with constant 25-50 foot climbs
- Characterized as a "POWER course" - favors fittest riders, not most technical
- Linear nature benefits strong cyclists over technical specialists

### Surface Conditions

**When Dry:**
- Deep sandy stretches
- Many embedded rocks with sharp edges
- Some loose climbs (especially Fire Tower)
- Fast rolling sections

**When Wet:**
- "All about survival"
- Mud holes throughout course
- Erosion creates additional challenges
- Historical races shortened due to weather (1990, 1991)

### Short & Fat Course (16 miles)
- Starts in Cable, heads south on Randysek Road
- Uses logging roads surrounding Telemark Resort
- Returns to Cable using American Birkebeiner Ski Trail and backwoods paths
- Same terrain challenges as 40, compressed distance

### Course Marking
- Course usually marked by Labor Day weekend
- Some sections cross private land (easement only on race day)
- Shared motorized trail sections - caution advised when pre-riding

## FORUM INSIGHTS

### Race Experience Quotes

**On the Festival Atmosphere:**
> "It is the only race where I've had bratwurst and beer at the feed stations."

> "It's something that you should do at least once. Everyone I met or rode with seemed very nice; it's an event that really makes you feel like you're part of a family."

**On the Course:**
> "If you're looking for legit singletrack there won't be much in this race... If you enjoy gravels, distance, and rollers you will find a happy place."

> "More about the festival atmosphere of it all and the rollout of 1700 bikes in a mass start."

**On the Lottery:**
> "Over a thousand riders were turned away as the Chequamegon Festival continues to hold its total registration to 2500 riders."

> "Hopeful participants learned to check their local banks to see if their checks had been cashed, a sure sign of acceptance into the event."

### Bottleneck Issues

**Start & Early Miles:**
> "When the racers made a left onto the trail system, the pace damn near stopped, as 2 paved lanes of bicycle traffic made a left onto the narrow ski trails climb."

**Fire Tower Climb:**
> "The one difficult climb at Firetower is usually so clogged with people walking that if you aren't amongst the first 100 riders through, you'll be walking too."

> "At the Fire Tower climb, it was a little congested with a line on the right that was walking and a line on the left that was climbing."

**Mud Sections:**
> "Around mile 5, a major bottleneck happens around a big mud hole."

> "I ripped off my leg and arm warmers here, since I had to get off the bike and do some standing and walking through the bottleneck anyways."

### Bike Setup Discussions

**Hardtail vs Gravel:**
- Peter Stetina (pro) finished 7th on Canyon Grizl gravel bike
- Course favors "Fitness and Speed race, rather than technical and skills race"
- Rigid bikes hard on hands and lower back after 3+ hours

**Tire Recommendations:**
- When dry: Low rolling resistance with decent float for sand
- Popular choices: Racing Ralphs, Kenda SB8s, IRC Mythos 2.1"
- Crows front and rear = fast but risky on sweeping corners
- 50-52mm clearance works well on gravel setups

**Gearing:**
- Single-speed: 34x19 or 34x18 viable
- Gravel: 46-36 chainrings + 11-40 cassette
- "Get a frame as light as you can afford (to make pushing the bike up firetower hill easier)"

### Training Recommendations

> "End of season form from racing road & TTs all year along with the build up for CX. A mixture of longer 2x20 minute intervals on the road with some 3-4 minute climbing VO2 type intervals each done once a week."

## BLACK PILL

### The Brutal Truths

**1. You Probably Won't Get In**
- Lottery system means hundreds/thousands rejected every year
- "Over a thousand riders were turned away"
- Must register by March for September race
- Life Time membership gives priority but isn't guaranteed

**2. Unless You're Elite, You'll Walk Fire Tower**
- "The one difficult climb at Firetower is usually so clogged with people walking that if you aren't amongst the first 100 riders through, you'll be walking too."
- Not a fitness issue - pure logistics of 2,000+ riders on narrow trail

**3. First Half Can Be a Parking Lot**
- Massive field (2,100+) funneling from paved start to narrow trails
- "The pace damn near stopped"
- Unless you're in first few gates, expect crawling speeds

**4. Not "Real" Mountain Biking**
- "If you're looking for legit singletrack there won't be much"
- Mostly wide grassy ski trails and fire roads
- Technical riders may be disappointed
- "Characterized as a power course, the linear nature favors the fittest and not necessarily the most technically accomplished rider"

**5. Lodging is a Nightmare**
- Small town infrastructure overwhelmed by 3,100+ racers plus support crews
- Book immediately upon lottery acceptance (6+ months out)
- Some lodging books up before lottery even happens

**6. Weather Russian Roulette**
- "Fickle weather month of September"
- Can go from "scorching predictions" to mud overnight
- Historical races shortened due to conditions
- Train for mud regardless

**7. Your Body Will Hurt**
- "Upper body takes a beating"
- Rigid bikes brutal after 3+ hours
- "Never ending profile fluctuations wear down even the fittest"
- Hands, lower back, legs all suffer

**8. You're Racing a 40+ Year Old Course**
- Not modern flow trails or purpose-built MTB course
- Nordic ski trail adapted for bikes
- "Rolling hills through the woods" - functional, not exciting

**9. Cut-off Times Are Real**
- 6-hour limit enforced
- First aid station cutoff: 11:45 AM (Mile 12)
- Miss it = pulled number, sag wagon, DNF

**10. It's a "Festival" as Much as a Race**
- If you want pure competition, might be disappointed
- Heavy emphasis on atmosphere, beer, bratwurst
- "More about the festival atmosphere of it all"

### Who Should Skip This Race:
- Technical singletrack purists
- Anyone who can't commit to March registration
- Riders who hate mass-start chaos
- People without flexible lodging options
- Anyone expecting a modern purpose-built MTB course
