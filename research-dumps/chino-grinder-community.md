(https://www.cxmagazine.com/riding-spy-chino-grinder-nicole-duke)

**Nicole Duke [ELITE]:** "Halfway down the 11 mile downhill, I casually crossed one of the [cattle] guards and got a pinch flat.

There are long and chunky washboard sections which flatted out a lot of riders, and this year included 8 miles of thick mud that was so deep that everyone's wheels locked up. We had to hike through mud to the next aid station where they were using sticks to carve out whatever clearance they could to get our bikes rideable again." On the 2022 mud conditions.

**PsychologicalFig9221 [COMPETITIVE]:** 35mm Panaracer Gravelkings (chunky front, slick rear) at 50 psi for 75 miles. "They held up nicely... with my heavy backside bouncing around on them so have no reason to complain... I feel like slick back and front would have worked just as well."

**PsychologicalFig9221 [COMPETITIVE]:** Built up a 2015 All City Nature Boy single speed with DT Swiss E1800 Road CX Gravel Disc wheelset (<$400), Prime Orra Aero Carbon Gravel Bars ($137.99). Initially chose 42x20 gearing but regretted it: "An easier gear would have sufficed." (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelbike/comments/1745hg1/chino_grinder/)

**Nicole Duke [ELITE]:** Changed from 44/34 cyclocross gearing to 50/34 from Wick Werks specifically for the long downhills, noting concern about "not having enough gearing with my 44/34 'cross set-up for the long downhills involved."

(https://gooldsgonewild.com/2016/05/10/chino-grinder-race-report-a-tale-of-two-races/)

## Weather Experienced

**2016 Race [Danielle Goold, ELITE]:** "Suddenly with two miles until the pavement the rain clouds rolled in and it started to rain and then hail. I was getting pummeled with hail and freezing cold rain... Then as quickly as it started hailing the dirt road turned into a mud pit full of red clay." The mud was so thick that "there must have been twenty pounds of mud on my bike, all over my chain, cassette and in every nook and cranny of the frame." Volunteers used a pedal wrench to knock mud off bikes at the aid station. (https://gooldsgonewild.com/2016/05/10/chino-grinder-race-report-a-tale-of-two-races/)

**2014 Race [Nicole Duke, ELITE]:** "Hot and dry." Afternoon conditions included "fierce, hot, headwind." She describes: "The desert was certainly unforgiving, the wind was sucking all the water out of us faster than we could replenish, the heat was stifling." (https://www.cxmagazine.com/riding-spy-chino-grinder-nicole-duke)

**2022 Race [askmatt, UNKNOWN]:** "8 miles of thick mud that was so deep that everyone's wheels locked up. We had to hike through mud to the next aid station where they were using sticks to carve out whatever clearance they could to get our bikes rideable again." (https://www.reddit.com/r/CanyonBikes/comments/xnpv8n/hardest_ride_of_my_life_grail_was_flawless/)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Opening Section (Miles 0-10):**

**Ryan Goold [ELITE]:** "The first ten miles are on a slight uphill... The road through this section was primo. The rain the night before kept the dust down and made the road very compact, almost like concrete in a few sections. Of course there were some wash boards here and there." (https://gooldsgonewild.com/2016/05/10/chino-grinder-race-report-a-tale-of-two-races/)

**Nicole Duke [ELITE]:** "The start of the race held the worst of the gravel: it was deep in some places, rocky in others, and the pace of the lead pack was continuously kicking up large rocks, slamming against bikes, bodies and sometimes sunglasses... It was so bumpy that even the cattle guards went unnoticed." (https://www.cxmagazine.com/riding-spy-chino-grinder-nicole-duke)

**Miles 10-30 (Descent to Verde River):**

**Ryan Goold [ELITE]:** "The second part of the dirt descends down to the beautiful Verde River and then climbs a bit followed by a few rollers. Along this section of the route you take a left hand turn and the course gets a little rougher from that point on... If I was on my mountain bike it would have been smooth as butter, but on my skinny little 33's there were a couple of sections that had my eyeballs bouncing around in my skull." (https://gooldsgonewild.com/2016/05/10/chino-grinder-race-report-a-tale-of-two-races/)

**Nicole Duke [ELITE]:** "Halfway down the 11 mile downhill, I casually crossed one of the [cattle] guards and got a pinch flat" - noting how easy it is to miss cattle guards in the rough terrain. (https://www.cxmagazine.com/riding-spy-chino-grinder-nicole-duke)

**Danielle Goold [ELITE]:** "The scenery was beautiful, big blue skies, red rocks in the distance and views of the Verde Valley. I couldn't stop smiling and thinking about how much I love Arizona and this style of riding." (https://gooldsgonewild.com/2016/05/10/chino-grinder-race-report-a-tale-of-two-races/)

**Main Climb:**

**Nicole Duke [ELITE]:** "The first hill would top out at mile 9... The race continues with a 14-mile climb to the top" at the turnaround. Jamey Driscoll attacked TJ Woodruff on this climb to take the win. (https://www.cxmagazine.com/riding-spy-chino-grinder-nicole-duke)

**PsychologicalFig9221 [COMPETITIVE]:** Describes "one large climb right in the middle of the race" and notes "The main climb turned out pleasantly to be a paved road climb, the altitude and heat however turned out to be rather unpleasant to say the least." (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelbike/comments/1745hg1/chino_grinder/)

**General Course:**

**PsychologicalFig9221 [COMPETITIVE]:** "The race is fun, basic, sometimes a little 'boring' If that can be said with all good intentions as this adds to the challenge... On the upside the descents are fun, with gravel grippy enough that you stick but not slide." (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelbike/comments/1745hg1/chino_grinder/)

**Course Composition:**

Multiple sources note 75-95% unpaved terrain, with the official description stating "60% gravel, 40% road" for the full 107-mile course. (https://www.granfondoguide.com/Events/Index/5163/chino-grinder, https://www.racecenter.com/cycling/chino-grinder)

**Historical Route:**

The course "follows the Overland Historic Road Trail, the oldest continuously used road in the United States (since 1000 AD)" from Chino Valley to Whitehorse Lake near Williams before returning. (https://www.bikesignup.com/Race/AZ/ChinoValley/ChinoGrinder)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Starting Strategy:**

**Ryan Goold [ELITE]:** "The first ten miles are on a slight uphill and my strategy was to hang on for dear life to the lead group. A terrible strategy as it turns out and I was dropped quicker than a bad habit." (https://gooldsgonewild.com/2016/05/10/chino-grinder-race-report-a-tale-of-two-races/)

**Danielle Goold [ELITE]:** "At the start I decided to line up near the front... This was my first attempt to push myself out of my comfort zone, as I normally line up in the back. I was hoping starting up front would allow me to get into one of the lead pelotons so I wouldn't have to work so hard trying to catch the group from the back." She was immediately dropped but notes: "my strategy for the race was to keep a relaxed pace on the way out and then dial-up the intensity for the second half of the race." Specifically: "Every time a group pulled away from me, I felt frustrated and nervous... Despite my already aching legs, I tried to keep a good effort going and pushed hard even on the slight down hills." (https://gooldsgonewild.com/2016/05/10/chino-grinder-race-report-a-tale-of-two-races/)

**Climbing Strategy:**

**Danielle Goold [ELITE]:** "I started gaining on a lot of riders in this section, but tried to keep my intensity dialed back, because I knew I had a really long climb ahead of me. This was a big exercise in discipline, because I like chasing people on climbs. To help stay calm, every time the road went slightly downhill I let my legs recover and coasted before spinning back up the next roller. I purposely stayed in the saddle with a high cadence, even though I wanted to mash on the pedals and pass people." (https://gooldsgonewild.com/2016/05/10/chino-grinder-race-report-a-tale-of-two-races/)

**Winning Strategy:**

**Jamey Driscoll [ELITE]:** After getting a flat and having teammate Ben Berden pace him back to the lead group, he "sat in for a bit before attacking up the hill to catch the lone rider off the front, TJ Woodruff." At the turnaround, "Jamey realized that TJ's mountain bike gearing was no match for his 'cross gearing and attacked on the downhill, leaving TJ spinning in the dust. Jamey then soloed the rest of the race" finishing 14 minutes ahead. (https://www.cxmagazine.com/riding-spy-chino-grinder-nicole-duke)

**Aid Station Strategy:**

**Danielle Goold [ELITE]:** "I very quickly reached the first aid station and decided to keep going; I must have passed ten to twenty riders here as most people had stopped to take a break." (https://gooldsgonewild.com/2016/05/10/chino-grinder-race-report-a-tale-of-two-races/)

**Training Approach:**

**Danielle Goold [ELITE]:** "I was feeling slightly undertrained since I had spent the majority of the last six months working on bike handling and cyclocross skills. However, I wasn't too concerned because I was doing Chino as a training race for the upcoming Crusher in the Tushar." (https://gooldsgonewild.com/2016/05/10/chino-grinder-race-report-a-tale-of-two-races/)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Mechanicals - Flats:**

**Nicole Duke [ELITE]:** Got three flats total - one pinch flat on a cattle guard at mile ~15, one slow leak in rear at first aid station, and a final flat on a downhill with no tubes remaining. She DNF'd at mile ~30 after 45 minutes waiting for support. Notes: "My ZIPPs required a minimum 60mm valve stem and everyone had 48's." (https://www.cxmagazine.com/riding-spy-chino-grinder-nicole-duke)

**Multiple riders [2016]:** Danielle Goold notes "I must have passed three or four other riders changing flats or tinkering with their bikes" in the first 30 miles. (https://gooldsgonewild.com/2016/05/10/chino-grinder-race-report-a-tale-of-two-races/)

**askmatt [UNKNOWN, 2022]:** "long and chunky washboard sections which flatted out a lot of riders." (https://www.reddit.com/r/CanyonBikes/comments/xnpv8n/hardest_ride_of_my_life_grail_was_flawless/)

**Weather/Conditions:**

**Mud section [2016, 2022]:** Multiple riders describe catastrophic mud conditions that nearly ended races. Danielle Goold: "I was really worried I was going to fall over in the mud or that my rear derailleur would snap. I stopped shifting and tried to spin quick little circles, letting the bike go where it wanted to go while staying light on my hands." (https://gooldsgonewild.com/2016/05/10/chino-grinder-race-report-a-tale-of-two-races/)

**Heat/Altitude:**

**PsychologicalFig9221 [COMPETITIVE]:** "The real problems started when climbing up the road towards the ever increasing temperature and ever decreasing oxygen. The thought of spending all day on the long and lonely road to the finish could not be described as a pleasant one. My legs seemed to work but the desire to continue began to diminish." He DNF'd at the halfway point after being told he was last on course and might not make time cutoff. (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelbike/comments/1745hg1/chino_grinder/)

**Gearing Issues:**

**PsychologicalFig9221 [COMPETITIVE]:** On his 42x20 single speed choice: "An easier gear would have sufficed as I spent a total of 5 minutes making friends and went about my merry way." The hard gearing contributed to his DNF. (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelbike/comments/1745hg1/chino_grinder/)

**Isolation:**

**PsychologicalFig9221 [COMPETITIVE]:** At the halfway point, "I was told I was the last person on the course and differing opinions on if I would make the time cut off. The ever lacking desire to continue seemed to flood into my legs." The psychological factor of being alone at the back was significant in his decision to DNF. (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelbike/comments/1745hg1/chino_grinder/)

**Nicole Duke [ELITE]:** After multiple flats, "Deciding to make a call not to be out hours past everyone else, I thought it best to turn around at this point... I was not comfortable continuing in the bleak, hot desert alone any further." (https://www.cxmagazine.com/riding-spy-chino-grinder-nicole-duke)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Pre-Race:**

**Nicole Duke [ELITE]:** "I was surprised at the start by a birthday song led by announcer Kaolin Cummens and followed by all the participants. It made my morning!" (on her 40th birthday). (https://www.cxmagazine.com/riding-spy-chino-grinder-nicole-duke)

**Ryan Goold [ELITE]:** Describes volunteer at first aid station who "recognized me and gave me some grief for running gears; I appreciated the heckling, and felt guilty with all the shifty bits on my bike" (he was on geared while locals often ride singlespeed). (https://gooldsgonewild.com/2016/05/10/chino-grinder-race-report-a-tale-of-two-races/)

**Support/Aid Stations:**

**Nicole Duke [ELITE]:** Met volunteers Mary Jo and Richard at communication station #3, where Richard "had carried all these years [a 44-year-old patch kit] in hopes that one day, someone would need it." Though the patches were dry-rotted, this illustrates volunteer dedication. Later "the promoter, Craig, jumped out of the car to help" when she was stranded. (https://www.cxmagazine.com/riding-spy-chino-grinder-nicole-duke)

**Danielle Goold [ELITE, 2016]:** At the mud section aid station, "The volunteer got out a pressure sprayer and tried to spray off some of the mud... I started grabbing softball sized chunks of clay and throwing them down, while the volunteer got out a pedal wrench and started knocking the mud off. After a couple of minutes I was eager to head back out and other riders were coming in. The volunteer lubed my chain and I was off." (https://gooldsgonewild.com/2016/05/10/chino-grinder-race-report-a-tale-of-two-races/)

**PsychologicalFig9221 [COMPETITIVE]:** After DNFing, "I jumped in the sag vehicle with a service dog and his owner. He gifted me with a survival bandana he had hand tailored. This happened to work great as a consolation prize and an awesome souvenir." (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelbike/comments/1745hg1/chino_grinder/)

**Post-Race:**

**Nicole Duke [ELITE]:** "Everyone was tired, crusted in salt, but feeling accomplished... For a first-year event, it was well organized, though I believe they learned that more water was certainly needed. All in all it was a certain success!" (https://www.cxmagazine.com/riding-spy-chino-grinder-nicole-duke)

**Pro Attendance:**

**2014 Race:** Attracted elite riders including Chloe Woodruff (fresh off Whiskey 50 win), TJ Woodruff, Jamey Driscoll, Ben Berden, Caroline Mani, and Nicole Duke. (https://www.cxmagazine.com/riding-spy-chino-grinder-nicole-duke)

**Event History:**

Described as "Arizona's oldest and most iconic gravel grinder" and "Arizona's longest-running gravel race" starting in 2014. (https://www.granfondoguide.com/Events/Index/5163/chino-grinder, https://www.racecenter.com/cycling/chino-grinder)

**Reputation:**

Multiple sources cite it as having "earned its reputation as the toughest gravel race in the West." (https://www.granfondoguide.com/Events/Index/5163/chino-grinder, https://www.racecenter.com/cycling/chino-grinder)

Ben Berden [ELITE] declared it "one of the hardest races he had ever done" after finishing 7th. (https://www.cxmagazine.com/riding-spy-chino-grinder-nicole-duke)

**Setting:**

Chino Valley described as "rural, ranching and agricultural community approximately 10 miles north of Prescott Valley, Arizona. Known as 'Big Sky' country based on its endless views in every direction, Chino Valley sits at around 4,700 ft. Although you won't find the iconic saguaros most commonly associated with the Arizona desert, the surrounding rolling hills are blanketed in golden Gama grasses where native Pronghorn roam." Elevation ranges 3,800-7,300 feet over the course. (https://www.granfondoguide.com/Events/Index/5163/chino-grinder)
