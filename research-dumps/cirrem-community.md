## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Zachary Schuster [UNKNOWN]:** "The 2019 race featured treacherous icy roads and a lot of DNFs" describing conditions as "foggy with periods of rain turning to snow late, low 30's 10 mph wind ice gravel melting to slush" (https://www.cxmagazine.com/tag/cirrem)

**Dave Mable [UNKNOWN]:** Provided "irreverent race report" after "tackl[ing] Iowa's CIRREM 100k gravel race on a singlespeed" (https://www.cxmagazine.com/tag/cirrem)

**Course description from race info [RECREATIONAL]:** "Year one brought (literally) rain, sleet and snow. Temps started in the mid 30's & dropped steadily throughout the day, until the freezing rain turned to snow (thank God). I remember stopping several times to wring the water out of my mittens, and I vividly remember Matt Maxwell's bright-red gloveless hands. It was cold & wet, the gravel was squishy, the pork sandwiches were greasy and the beer was good." (https://cirrem.com/race-info/)

**Course description Year 2 [RECREATIONAL]:** "Year two saw colder temps at the start, but as the temps rose from the teens into the upper 30's, the frozen snow on the roads melted and turned smooshy & muddy. Several riders pulled their fenders off mid-ride because of the peanut-buttery build up causing tire-rub. The relatively warm, sunny day led to concrete-white covered bikes, drivetrains & racers. Singlespeed anyone? The pork sandwiches were greasy and the beer was good." (https://cirrem.com/race-info/)

**Course description Year 3 [RECREATIONAL]:** "Year three started with temps in teens, and the overcast conditions kept temps in the 20's for the day. Two inches of snow the night before didn't seem to bother anyone, nor did the sleet early on in the race, with attendance above 100 for the first time. The roads were sometimes unpredictable in spots, and caused a small pile up in the first half of the race among the leaders. Mountain bike anyone? Once the green flag was waved, no more mishaps were reported (must have been a first timer). I remember my toes on my left foot were cold. Booties anyone? The pork sandwiches were greasy and beer was good." (https://cirrem.com/race-info/)

**Race organizer warning [RECREATIONAL]:** "There is also a bridge (or bridges) with spaces between the boards that eat wheels for lunch. Seriously, a friend separated his shoulder last weekend on it. No kidding. Please take care out there." (https://cirrem.com/race-info/)

**Gran Fondo Guide description [RECREATIONAL]:** "CIRREM is a 100k (62 mile) bike race/ride that starts & ends at the Cumming Tap. This ride takes place in the cold, nasty, hilly gravel roads in the middle of winter...don't sign up if there is a chance you will not attend."

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Bike choice advice [RECREATIONAL]:** "Your guess is as good as mine on this one. The winners have ridden singlespeed mountain bikes, fender'ed cross bikes, and the normal 'cross fare. You'll see mountain bikes, cross bikes, ss's, fenders, fixies, fat bikes and even road bikes. No recumbents or unicycles yet, though I expect that might change this year. Point is, ride what you feel comfy on, because chances are you're faster that way. Put Kent Carlson on gears and he'll look at you funny and waste 19 of them. Put Pete Basso on a singlespeed and watch the bike beg for mercy before buckling under the torque. Run what ya brung, sister." (https://cirrem.com/race-info/)

**Aerodynamics testing - Bar Mitts vs Pogies Lites vs Gloves [UNKNOWN]:** A coach performed field aero testing comparing hand protection options:
- "For a 64.5 mile race (Cirrem), relative to gloves the Pogies Lites would cost me (be slower) 0:02:19, and using Bar Mitts would cost 0:02:10"
- "The Pogie Lites came out better than I expected in terms of aero losses...I have really big hands. In gloves, that means they fill up the Pogie Lites pretty well, which may make the Pogie Lites perform better on me than they would for someone with smaller hands."
- Bar Mitts: "These are my choice for cold weather training rides because they are the warmest for me and easiest to get my big hands in and out of when riding. Would I race in them? Doubtful. Even with a long race like IAWAR they are simply too big / bulky."
- Pogie Lites: "Being light material, I find they are note as warm for me as Bar Mitts, but work well down to about 20 – 25 degrees with my compromised hand and a decent glove...Would I race in them? Yes, I think they would be good for low predicted temps"
