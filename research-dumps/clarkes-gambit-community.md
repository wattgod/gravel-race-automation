# CLARKES GAMBIT — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Event Overview & Format

**Clarke's Gambit** is a two-day gravel overnighter held in Nelligen, NSW, Australia. The event is organized by Graveleur and named after the Clarke gang, bushrangers who operated in the Braidwood-Bega region in the 1860s. The race is based at the Steam Packet Hotel in Nelligen, on the banks of the Clyde River between Budawang National Park and the coast.

**Format:**
- Two-day event with overnight camping/accommodation
- Start/finish across from BIG4 Caravan Park Nelligen
- Registration and social activities at Steam Packet Hotel
- Not primarily a race — described as a "social cycling experience"
- Optional one-day participation available

**Course Options (2024-2026):**
- **Short Course:** 35-50km per day, under 1000m climbing per day (family-friendly, ages 12-17 welcome)
- **Medium Course:** 55km per day, 1200m climbing per day
- **Long Course:** 90-100km (Saturday only in some years), 1900-2000m climbing

The event has run multiple years: 2023, 2024, 2025, and 2026 editions are documented.

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

The event emphasizes a social, inclusive atmosphere over pure competition. From the official description: "Imagine you have just finished a days cycling on mint gravel backroads. You are tired but feel at peace as you enjoy a drink with your friends and family at the SteamPacket Hotel and watch the sunset." (https://graveleur.cc/clarkes-gambit-event-page)

The organizers explicitly position it as accessible: "The overnighter is not a race, but rather a social cycling experience designed to be enjoyed in small groups of cyclists of similar ability." (https://raceroster.com/events/2026/112569/clarkes-gambit-2026)

**Event director Mike Israel [ORGANIZER]:** "For Graveleurs, it is all about the journey, not the destination and exploring the gravel and unsealed roads on bicycles is definitely their game. Ultimately it is about discovering new places and creating new adventures on a bicycle." (https://eurobodalla.com.au/get-ready-for-gravel/)

**Mike Israel [ORGANIZER]:** "This event is primarily designed as a social event and most of our riders come to enjoy the ride, as much as a good meal and a beer or two at the end of the day. That is how we roll at Graveleur." (https://eurobodalla.com.au/get-ready-for-gravel/)

**Social elements include:**
- Friday night early registration at Steam Packet Hotel
- Saturday night entertainment, post-ride drinks and celebrations
- Professional photography by ReadyAimMedia included
- Commemorative patch for participants
- Volunteer support from Milton Ulladulla Cyclists (MUC)

The event has grown significantly — the 2023 edition was described as their "biggest event ever" with approximately 200 riders expected by 2022. (https://www.batemansbaypost.com.au/story/7950149/clarkes-gambit-gravel-race-comes-to-nelligen/)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Surface Quality:**
The event uses predominantly State Forest roads described as "groomed gravel" and "champagne gravel roads." The organizers emphasize these are maintained roads in good condition when dry.

**Mike Israel [ORGANIZER]:** "We are aiming to stick almost entirely to State Forest roads that in the dry are mostly very smooth and a joy to ride. But a turn in the weather can bring on a dramatic change in conditions for the worse." (https://eurobodalla.com.au/get-ready-for-gravel/)

**Mike Israel [ORGANIZER]:** "Please don't bring your roadie, even if you have 28mm tyres on it." (https://eurobodalla.com.au/get-ready-for-gravel/)

**Climbing Profile:**
- Routes described as having "No back breaking climbs"
- Short course: under 1000m climbing per day
- Medium course: 1200m climbing per day  
- Long course: approximately 1900-2000m climbing (Saturday)
- Described as "Type 1 Fun only" and "Very accessible courses"

**Navigation:**
Riders are expected to be "experienced at navigating and following a GPX route" — the event uses digital navigation rather than extensive physical marking to reduce environmental impact and costs. (https://raceroster.com/events/2026/112569/clarkes-gambit-2026)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Bike Requirements:**
Road bikes are explicitly discouraged. The organizers warn: "Please don't bring your roadie, even if you have 28mm tyres on it." This suggests proper gravel bikes with wider tires are necessary. (https://eurobodalla.com.au/get-ready-for-gravel/)

**E-bikes are welcome** across all course options. (https://graveleur.cc/events/clarkes-gambit-2024)

**Bikepacking:**
The format does NOT require bike packing gear since the start/finish is at the accommodation location: "Bike Packing not required — Start/finish is across the road from the Caravan park so you can ride light!" (https://graveleur.cc/events/clarkes-gambit-2024)

**Navigation Equipment:**
GPS-enabled bike computer or device with GPX capability is essential. The event website emphasizes: "Uploading a GPX/FIT file to your bike computer is super easy... Downloading maps = not getting lost + save the planet." (https://graveleur.cc/clarkes-gambit-event-page)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Fitness Requirements [GENERAL]:**
Riders need to "be at a good level of fitness to complete their chosen distance at an average speed of 15-20 kph" and "understand how to fuel their body for an extended ride." (https://graveleur.cc/events/clarkes-gambit-2024)

**Self-Sufficiency Required:**
Participants need "a reasonable level of mechanical know how in case you need to perform running repairs on your bicycle e.g. punctures, ripped tyres, broken chains, non-functioning gears." (https://raceroster.com/events/2026/112569/clarkes-gambit-2026)

**Support Provided:**
- On-course feed zones
- Mechanical support available
- Ride leaders offered for some categories (family-friendly options)

The event is designed to be ridden in "small groups of cyclists of similar ability" rather than as an individual time trial. (https://raceroster.com/events/2026/112569/clarkes-gambit-2026)
