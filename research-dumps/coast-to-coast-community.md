# COAST TO COAST — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## IMPORTANT: Two Different Races

**CRITICAL DISAMBIGUATION:** The sources cover TWO completely different "Coast to Coast" races:

1. **Kathmandu Coast to Coast (New Zealand)** - A legendary multi-sport race crossing New Zealand's South Island (243km total: running, cycling, kayaking)
2. **Coast to Coast Gravel Grinder (Michigan, USA)** - A 204-mile gravel bike race across Michigan's Lower Peninsula

These are entirely separate events on different continents. Research below is separated by race.

## NEW ZEALAND COAST TO COAST

### Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Sam Manson [ELITE] (2023 Champion, 2024 Participant):** "I raced as best as I could on the day, something I can always guarantee. I was very keen to make sure that if anyone wanted the title they would still have to work bloody hard for it!" (https://sammanson.com/2024/03/01/2024-kathmandu-coast-to-coast-race-report-all-of-last-year/)

**Sam Manson [ELITE]:** "By 10km in I'm getting cramp in my VMO muscles now, and feeling very sore, so a bit frustrated by this... The downhill was hard with fatigue quite high and very sore muscles and lack of coordination... On the final single track flats Robbie pulls away and my own pace was not actually that good. Cramp finally arrives in full force on the last few crossings." (https://sammanson.com/2024/03/01/2024-kathmandu-coast-to-coast-race-report-all-of-last-year/)

**Sam Manson [ELITE] on preparation:** "I spent most last year considering whether I wanted to return to the Coast to Coast or not, which I found to be a surprisingly hard decision. I have typically come back because I wanted to win (just once) but that was no longer required." (https://sammanson.com/2024/03/01/2024-kathmandu-coast-to-coast-race-report-all-of-last-year/)

**Kirsty Howatson [COMPETITIVE]:** "NOTE: You think Ironman's hard? This is hard... The challenge with the Coast to Coast is the unknowns - what the conditions that are going to be like on the day. You can have 30 degrees. You can have the river levels being really high or very little water in the river, which means the river lines are really difficult." (https://www.dietitianapproved.com/blog/newzealandcoasttocoastracereport)

**Kirsty Howatson [COMPETITIVE] on kayaking:** "But the kayak is the thing that makes or breaks your race. It's not just kayaking down the river - it's Grade 2 rapids. It's the fact you spend a lot of time upside down in your boat when you're learning." (https://www.dietitianapproved.com/blog/newzealandcoasttocoastracereport)

**Kirsty Howatson [COMPETITIVE] on mental state:** "I got to this same point - where you can go one way or the other - if you consume loads more here, it's going to go badly for you. And if you back off, it'll be okay. I front ended my nutrition on the bike. And then it meant that on the run, when I hit that point, and I was four or five hours into the race, it was actually okay because I knew I was going to have enough in the tank to get going." (https://www.dietitianapproved.com/blog/newzealandcoasttocoastracereport)

**Lynnette [ELITE] (Category Winner):** "Winning my category. The fact that I actually won, is like getting the whole cake and eating it cherries and all!" (https://cyclejourneys.co.nz/lynnette-coast-to-coast/)

**Sam Manson [ELITE] on race dynamics:** "Sat around 165-166bpm until the first crossing then jumped up to 178 bpm!! Had to slow down a bit and continue to moderate HR and breathing and coordination from here. By the time I could see Twin slips (around 3km up the river), I could see Hamish, Ben and Alex Hunt climbing over the other side (That's like 1km ahead!! So around 4-5 mins already!)" (https://sammanson.com/2024/03/01/2024-kathmandu-coast-to-coast-race-report-all-of-last-year/)

**Sam Manson [ELITE] on camaraderie:** "At some point I realise I'm not going to shake him and after around 20mins of running together and suffering together I say 'Hey Robbie, this is living eh!?' to Robbie agrees with 'Sam, this is living' spoken in his thick Tasmanian accent." (https://sammanson.com/2024/03/01/2024-kathmandu-coast-to-coast-race-report-all-of-last-year/)

### Equipment & Gear Recommendations (NZ)

**Sam Manson [ELITE] - Running Shoes:** "For the 4th year in a row I'm rocking the Scott Kinabalu Ultra RC shoes. They've always been amazing on this terrain." (https://sammanson.com/2024/03/01/2024-kathmandu-coast-to-coast-race-report-all-of-last-year/)

**Sam Manson [ELITE] - Bike Choice:** "I chose to use the Trek Speed Concept (Well tuned by HUB cycles!) TT bike this year to keep things simple for my support crew and shoe plates as I believed my running was going well." (https://sammanson.com/2024/03/01/2024-kathmandu-coast-to-coast-race-report-all-of-last-year/)

**Sam Manson [ELITE] - Eyewear:** "I'm rocking the new Julbo Edge sunnies this year with the magnetic changeable lens and had clear lens on this time of the day (of course)." (https://sammanson.com/2024/03/01/2024-kathmandu-coast-to-coast-race-report-all-of-last-year/)

**Kirsty Howatson [COMPETITIVE] - Mandatory Safety Gear:** "In the Coast to Coast, you have to carry: your emergency kit and blanket, your waterproof jacket and pants, your thermals (basically your tops and bottoms), your woolly hat. So you don't want your food to be an extra weight." (https://www.dietitianapproved.com/blog/newzealandcoasttocoastracereport)

**Lynnette [ELITE] - Anti-Chafing:** "Use more GurneyGoo. For those of you who don't know what it is, it's the ultimate secret weapon for anyone competing in adventure races! GurneyGoo will prevent blisters, chafing, and prune foot – basically a Coast to Coast competitors best friend." (https://cyclejourneys.co.nz/lynnette-coast-to-coast/)

**Kirsty Howatson [COMPETITIVE] - Kayak Preparation:** "You need a support crew. Someone that's going to get up at 4:50 am and take your kayak to the kayak start, Who's going to pick up your bike and take it to places and Who's going to feed you all weekend!" (https://www.dietitianapproved.com/blog/newzealandcoasttocoastracereport)

### Race Strategy & Pacing (NZ)

**Sam Manson [ELITE] - Early Run Pace:** "I'm straight into 3:50min/km pace (faster than 2023) but settled down to 4 min/km pace to keep my HR in check." Note: This is elite-level pacing - 3:50-4:00/km is approximately 6:10-6:25/mile pace on technical mountain terrain. (https://sammanson.com/2024/03/01/2024-kathmandu-coast-to-coast-race-report-all-of-last-year/)

**Sam Manson [ELITE] - Road Bike Drafting:** "The front group starts to develop, Ben Philips does some hard pulls on the front that scares off a few people and eventually we get into some good rotations. The group must be around 20-23 guys with 5-6 that were hiding at the back... The ride ended up being over 8mins faster than last year which shows you how slow the 2023 group worked (or didn't)." (https://sammanson.com/2024/03/01/2024-kathmandu-coast-to-coast-race-report-all-of-last-year/)

**Kirsty Howatson [COMPETITIVE] - Nutrition Flexibility:** "I tried a lot of different products... I didn't want to drink any of my calories on the bike or run. It's not like triathlons where say, at 15 minutes, you can drink X number of mls and you can mark it out on your bottle. Adventure racing's just a bit more chill than that. More 'We'll do a bit of this and it'll be okay'." (https://www.dietitianapproved.com/blog/newzealandcoasttocoastracereport)

**Kirsty Howatson [COMPETITIVE] - Mental Strategy Food:** "On the run, because I don't like sweet later on in the day I took two slices of pizza and half a box of Domino's wedges. Plus all the gels and stuff I understand it wasn't the best nutritionally but, in these events, you've got to do the things that are going to mentally make you happy, because at some point you're going to be in a hole seven hours in, and it's going to be a sad face, and how do you get through it?" (https://www.dietitianapproved.com/blog/newzealandcoasttocoastracereport)

**Kirsty Howatson [COMPETITIVE] - Day 2 Kayak Strategy:** "Day Two was just different because you're in the kayaks. You are more restricted in what you could have... I'd gone for these bars called OSMs or One Square Meals, and they've got 90 grams of carbs in them. You knew that you could open it, you could have a bite of it and it pretty much does you for 45 minutes, maybe longer. Open it, one mouthful, done. You put it back in your spray skirt." (https://www.dietitianapproved.com/blog/newzealandcoasttocoastracereport)

**Lynnette [ELITE] - Training Timeline:** "The first time, I dedicated 12 months to prepare as I had never done endurance events, been on a road bike, run over a mountain or paddled a kayak. I learned about nutrition and how to fuel on the go." (https://cyclejourneys.co.nz/lynnette-coast-to-coast/)

### Terrain Details (NZ - Rider Perspective)

**Sam Manson [ELITE] - Opening Run:** "Starting on the road rather than the beach made for a smoother start than usual... Once on top flats I was comfortable and tucked in around 7th place." (https://sammanson.com/2024/03/01/2024-kathmandu-coast-to-coast-race-report-all-of-last-year/)

**Sam Manson [ELITE] - Goat Pass Run Hazards:** "Then at the river crossing opposite Spray Creek Falls, I trip and bang my knee hard, this really hurt and I walked for a minute or two... The descent off Dudley Knob, I'm very very sore in my VMO's and I wince with every landing waiting for them to burst. On the final single track flats Robbie pulls away and my own pace was not actually that good. Cramp finally arrives in full force on the last few crossings and then I stumble my way up the annoying new entrance chute which is off my own line to the standard entrance." (https://sammanson.com/2024/03/01/2024-kathmandu-coast-to-coast-race-report-all-of-last-year/)

**Kirsty Howatson [COMPETITIVE] - Overall Course:** "The Coast to Coast is a race from the coast of one side of New Zealand to the coast of the other side of New Zealand. The aim is that you're going to cross the country, which is 243 kilometres on foot, bike and in a kayak... then it's 30 kilometers over Goat Pass, which is just one of the passes in the middle of the Southern Alps with 1000 meters of elevation. You need to cover that in about 5 hours." (https://www.dietitianapproved.com/blog/newzealandcoasttocoastracereport)

**Kirsty Howatson [COMPETITIVE] - Final Challenge:** "And then the final 70 kms into Christchurch, which is pretty much a headwind the whole way! And you need to basically scramble up a sand bank to actually get across the finish line - in your bike cleats!" (https://www.dietitianapproved.com/blog/newzealandcoasttocoastracereport)

**Kirsty Howatson [COMPETITIVE] - Kayak Section:** "It's officially 67km, (but really 71 kms) in your kayak... It's not just kayaking down the river - it's Grade 2 rapids... There are parts in the gorge where you can still open stuff but you're far more restricted than you are to say like on a bike or on a run, as to what you can pull out of a pocket and open. You've always got to have one hand on your paddle otherwise, it's floating down the river." (https://www.dietitianapproved.com/blog/newzealandcoasttocoastracereport)

### DNF Risk Factors (NZ)

**Sam Manson [ELITE] - Health Issues:** Sam's 2023 post-race year shows vulnerability even for elite athletes: "Oct – managed some regular training... 26th ended up with weird stomach pain and a fever... Nov – Stomach and fever still bad, just Topsport work for first 2 weeks... Caught a virus, 24th tried to race day 1 of the Five Passes cycle tour, went terribly, high heart rate, high fatigue, low energy... Pulled out. Home early. Sick and tired rest of month." (https://sammanson.com/2024/03/01/2024-kathmandu-coast-to-coast-race-report-all-of-last-year/)

**Kirsty Howatson [COMPETITIVE] - Capsizing Risk:** "You spend a lot of time upside down in your boat when you're learning... You have to get your Grade 2 Kayak Certificate. A four day course where you prove that you can paddle in the water, self rescue, rescue the rope and that you've got a certain range of skills." (https://www.dietitianapproved.com/blog/newzealandcoasttocoastracereport)

**Kirsty Howatson [COMPETITIVE] - Nutrition Timing:** "I got to this same point - where you can go one way or the other - if you consume loads more here, it's going to go badly for you. And if you back off, it'll be okay." (https://www.dietitianapproved.com/blog/newzealandcoasttocoastracereport)

### Weather Experienced (NZ)

**Kirsty Howatson [COMPETITIVE] - Variability:** "The challenge with the Coast to Coast is the unknowns - what the conditions that are going to be like on the day. You can have 30 degrees. You can have the river levels being really high or very little water in the river, which means the river lines are really difficult." (https://www.dietitianapproved.com/blog/newzealandcoasttocoastracereport)

**Race Report [ELITE] - 2025 Conditions:** "Competing in humid conditions, King finished in 4:57:14... 'It was hot and muggy and sticky, but I had a good first ride,' King says." (https://www.coasttocoast.co.nz/two-day-race-report)

**Race Report [ELITE] - 2025 Weather Bomb:** "Weather bomb forces course change... Two day competitors to run Otira Viaduct." (https://www.coasttocoast.co.nz/two-day-race-report)

**Race Report [ELITE] - 2026 Day One:** "Torrential downpours for Day One... Two Day leaders emerge after a wet day of racing." (https://www.coasttocoast.co.nz/two-day-race-report)

### Community Feel & Atmosphere (NZ)

**Sam Manson [ELITE] - Suffering Together:** "At some point I realise I'm not going to shake him and after around 20mins of running together and suffering together I say 'Hey Robbie, this is living eh!?' to Robbie agrees with 'Sam, this is living' spoken in his thick Tasmanian accent." (https://sammanson.com/2024/03/01/2024-kathmandu-coast-to-coast-race-report-all-of-last-year/)

**Sam Manson [ELITE] - Race Morning:** "Watching the News article on Alex, 1 day before the race (Sneaky photo thanks to Rob)... Heart rate was over 125bpm with a minute to go, very high, must have been nervous!" (https://sammanson.com/2024/03/01/2024-kathmandu-coast-to-coast-race-report-all-of-last-year/)

**Lynnette [ELITE] - Post-Race Reflection:** "When sitting down to chat about the race, it brings out the biggest smile on her face – all the post C2C feels come flooding back!" (https://cyclejourneys.co.nz/lynnette-coast-to-coast/)

**Lynnette [ELITE] - Top Takeaways:** "Keep a sense of humour – praise your crew – thank the volunteers." (https://cyclejourneys.co.nz/lynnette-coast-to-coast/)

**Race Report - Scale:** "They are among the 700 athletes participating in the two-day events, embarking on a 55-kilometre bike ride from Kūmara Beach on the South Island's West Coast." (https://www.coasttocoast.co.nz/two-day-race-report)

## MICHIGAN COAST TO COAST GRAVEL GRINDER

### Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Sarah Porch [COMPETITIVE] - 2025 Experience:** "The tailwind that usually helps push riders along for the first section did not occur this year. Thankfully, we 'slightly' obsessed over the weather leading in race day. The Epic Rides forecast calling for unusually strong headwinds was correct." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/sarahs-story-coast-to-coast-gravel-grinder)

**Sarah Porch [COMPETITIVE] - Heat and Conditions:** "The sun. The heat. The humidity. It sapped energy. We found some shade to lower the body temp and stretched. We both nearly ran out of hydration despite each carrying two Bivo insulated bottles and a full hydration pack... It was only predicted to reach the low 80s, but that was clearly not the case." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/sarahs-story-coast-to-coast-gravel-grinder)

**Sarah Porch [COMPETITIVE] - Michigan Kindness:** "And then…the kindness…we're in Michigan, folks. The Midwest. Several residents set up water and cooling stations for the racers. One kind family put up a sunshade, chairs, and a table so racers could stop and take ice and cold bottled water, or play in the sprinkler as some do." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/sarahs-story-coast-to-coast-gravel-grinder)

**Sarah Porch [COMPETITIVE] - Sand Section:** "We pre-rode to experience the Michigan sand. On race day it looked different, as sand does. The heavy rains over the previous couple of days dried a bit and parts were easier to navigate. We also felt more confident. Yeah, planning. We peered down at the Pine River, a Nationally-designated Scenic River. It looked inviting – especially as we had time to admire the shimmering water as we trudged through deep sand. More than a few areas were not rideable – or at least when weighing the risk of navigating deep, wheel-eating sand." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/sarahs-story-coast-to-coast-gravel-grinder)

**Sarah Porch [COMPETITIVE] - Night Riding:** "Our goal of beating the sun faded as fast as the daylight. No problem. SAIL. Readjust goal. Ride strong. Have fun. Cherish friendships. Enjoy others around you also racing to Ludington. We set off at dusk into the single-track section... The bike lights didn't diminish the beauty of flickering fireflies or the stars in the sky." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/sarahs-story-coast-to-coast-gravel-grinder)

**Race Creator [UNKNOWN LEVEL] - Route Philosophy:** "Our goal in creating the route wasn't to just string together whatever gravel roads we could find and call it good. We truly put a lot of time into deciding what routes to use, what the rider experience would be and what we wanted folks to see along the way... Mark, my co-promoter, and I have even debated on whether or not to include sections as short as a mile in length versus another road." (https://www.salsacycles.com/blogs/articles/coast-to-coast-gravel-grinder-a-new-epic-is-born)

**Race Creator [UNKNOWN LEVEL] - Course Trademark:** "These forest roads are one of the trademarks of the Coast to Coast route. Other races might be known for their B-roads or Minimum Maintenance roads, but the Coast to Coast will be known by its forest roads." (https://www.salsacycles.com/blogs/articles/coast-to-coast-gravel-grinder-a-new-epic-is-born)

### Equipment & Gear Recommendations (Michigan)

**Race Creator [UNKNOWN LEVEL] - Tire Choice Critical:** "Having ridden the course, I can tell you firsthand that while 32mm tires may seem like a great idea in the first 50 miles, they'll have you walking in the Manistee National Forest. If we have a wet spring, then the forest roads should be fairly firm, but if it's dry you'll wish you had a fatbike. I've sampled the course on the Salsa Warbird with 42mm tires as well as the Salsa Cutthroat on 29x2.1" tires, and both treated me well." (https://www.salsacycles.com/blogs/articles/coast-to-coast-gravel-grinder-a-new-epic-is-born)

**Race Creator [UNKNOWN LEVEL] - Storage Needs:** "Keep in mind you'll be riding your bike for 210 miles, so those extra few millimeters of tire cushion aren't exactly a bad thing. A good frame bag, hydration pack, or bikepacking seatbag setup should leave you with enough room for a few layering options as well as reserve snacks." (https://www.salsacycles.com/blogs/articles/coast-to-coast-gravel-grinder-a-new-epic-is-born)

**Sarah Porch [COMPETITIVE] - Hydration Setup:** "We both nearly ran out of hydration despite each carrying two Bivo insulated bottles and a full hydration pack." Note: In extreme heat, even 3+ liters of capacity proved barely adequate between checkpoints. (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/sarahs-story-coast-to-coast-gravel-grinder)

### Weather Experienced (Michigan)

**Sarah Porch [COMPETITIVE] - 2025 Actual Conditions:** "The tailwind that usually helps push riders along for the first section did not occur this year... unusually strong headwinds... The cloud cover dissipated and the temperature rose... the hot, sunbaked pavement... The sun. The heat. The humidity. It sapped energy... It was only predicted to reach the low 80s, but that was clearly not the case." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/sarahs-story-coast-to-coast-gravel-grinder)

**Sarah Porch [COMPETITIVE] - 2025 Pre-Race Rain:** "The heavy rains over the previous couple of days dried a bit and parts [of the sand] were easier to navigate." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/sarahs-story-coast-to-coast-gravel-grinder)

**Race Creator [UNKNOWN LEVEL] - Spring Variability:** "The weather in Michigan is largely a question mark in the spring months. We've been known to be graced with 80 degrees and sunshine but also 35 degrees and freezing rain. Being surrounded by freshwater oceans means the wind can change at a moment's notice. Riders should come prepared to tackle anything from cold rain to dry heat and headwinds." (https://www.salsacycles.com/blogs/articles/coast-to-coast-gravel-grinder-a-new-epic-is-born)

### Terrain Details (Michigan - Rider Perspective)

**Sarah Porch [COMPETITIVE] - Course Progression:** "The sunrise came early. It was 6:00 AM ET…time to race 204 miles across Michigan's Mitten (the Lower Peninsula) starting in Au Gres, set along Lake Huron's shore through the gravel roads, farmland, grassland, double and single track until we reached the sandy beach in Ludington." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/sarahs-story-coast-to-coast-gravel-grinder)

**Sarah Porch [COMPETITIVE] - Checkpoint Distances:** "Checkpoint 1 (mile 54)... Checkpoint 2 (mile 103)... Checkpoint 3: Mile 169. We entered the Big M Recreation Area and were greeted by the mosquitos. So many that you almost needed to hold your breath. Bug spray? They couldn't care less." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/sarahs-story-coast-to-coast-gravel-grinder)

**Sarah Porch [COMPETITIVE] - Trail Hazards:** "The previous rains left large, trail-wide puddles on the trail. Some were easy to navigate while others suggested a bit more caution. The moss layer on top of some was eerie. Happy to see those and not mistakenly ride into it like some others." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/sarahs-story-coast-to-coast-gravel-grinder)

**Sarah Porch [COMPETITIVE] - Pine River Section:** "We dropped into a section of the Manistee National Forest... We peered down at the Pine River, a Nationally-designated Scenic River. It looked inviting – especially as we had time to admire the shimmering water as we trudged through deep sand. More than a few areas were not rideable." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/sarahs-story-coast-to-coast-gravel-grinder)

**Race Creator [UNKNOWN LEVEL] - Route Character:** "The Coast to Coast route is quintessential Michigan; rural country roads, farmland, dense forest, creeks, rivers, rolling hills, white pine stands, two-tracks, and of course, beautiful coastline! Riders will begin their journey at the marshy shores of Lake Huron... farmland is abundant in this area. Before too long, the route begins to roll crossing through game areas and state land." (https://www.salsacycles.com/blogs/articles/coast-to-coast-gravel-grinder-a-new-epic-is-born)

**Race Creator [UNKNOWN LEVEL] - Forest Roads:** "Near the halfway point riders will enter the small town of Marion before once again setting out into the countryside. The hills come more frequently now and become steeper in sections... The adventure turns up a notch here as riders are introduced to four-digit forest roads, some qualifying less as roads and more as paths. The soil becomes sandy on this side of the state and the pine needles mixing with the dry earth creates a most pleasant aroma." (https://www.salsacycles.com/blogs/articles/coast-to-coast-gravel-grinder-a-new-epic-is-born)

**Race Creator [UNKNOWN LEVEL] - Pine River Corridor:** "Riders will have the great fortune of riding along the Pine River National Scenic River corridor on 100-plus feet bluffs above the clay and sandy bottomed waterway. A fast descent to Low Bridge and up the other side will poise riders for the third and final checkpoint in Dublin." (https://www.salsacycles.com/blogs/articles/coast-to-coast-gravel-grinder-a-new-epic-is-born)

**Race Creator [UNKNOWN LEVEL] - Final Approach:** "The crossing of the Little Manistee River will be a signal to riders that their journey is nearing an end. The terrain from here on out becomes more civilized although not too much so. Nearing the lakeshore, one will be able to smell a certain freshness in the breeze. The path ahead flattens out as riders push on towards the freshwater coast of Lake Michigan. It won't be until the last mile that riders catch a glimpse of the mighty lake." (https://www.salsacycles.com/blogs/articles/coast-to-coast-gravel-grinder-a-new-epic-is-born)

### Race Strategy & Pacing (Michigan)

**Sarah Porch [COMPETITIVE] - Support Strategy:** "Beth Collins... graciously offered to be the Support Crew extraordinaire... Beth greeted us as we crossed the Checkpoint 1 timing mat and directed us to the van. We took a bit more time than planned to stretch after fighting the wind... Beth once again had a buffet for easy replenishment. Real food (PB&J, PB & banana, and Michigan sweet red cherries) tasted amazing as we stocked up ride fuel and hydration." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/sarahs-story-coast-to-coast-gravel-grinder)

**Sarah Porch [COMPETITIVE] - Goal Adjustment:** "We made the last turn and started the countdown. Heading down Lake Shore Drive, we turned into Stearns Park and crossed the finish together, just as planned. Time to touch the front tire in Lake Michigan! Much gratitude to Coaches Brig Brandt and Tina Hart for preparing me and Andrea (respectively) for this race." Note: Coached athletes. (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/sarahs-story-coast-to-coast-gravel-grinder)

**Race Creator [UNKNOWN LEVEL] - 100-Mile Alternative:** "For those of you not ready to 'Commit to the Mitt' fear not, we've got something special in store for you too! The shorter Coast Loop event offers much of the same scenery in a pleasant but challenging 100-mile loop format. The Coast Loop will start and finish in Ludington, MI. Coast Loop riders will be treated to many wonderful and quiet forest roads and will join the Coast to Coast route at the checkpoint of Dublin." (https://www.salsacycles.com/blogs/articles/coast-to-coast-gravel-grinder-a-new-epic-is-born)

### Community Feel & Atmosphere (Michigan)

**Sarah Porch [COMPETITIVE] - Local Support:** "And then…the kindness…we're in Michigan, folks. The Midwest. Several residents set up water and cooling stations for the racers. One kind family put up a sunshade, chairs, and a table so racers could stop and take ice and cold bottled water, or play in the sprinkler as some do." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/sarahs-story-coast-to-coast-gravel-grinder)

**Sarah Porch [COMPETITIVE] - Finish Experience:** "We were greeted by Beth, the Coast to Coast staff, volunteers, other racers and support team. Time to touch the front tire in Lake Michigan!" (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/sarahs-story-coast-to-coast-gravel-grinder)

**Race Creator [UNKNOWN LEVEL] - Ludington Destination:** "The coastal town of Ludington is a vacation paradise with wonderful beaches, delectable delicacies, and nice accommodations. Michigan is known for its sweet treats such as fudge, maple syrup, and ice cream. Reward yourself with a couple scoops piled into a freshly made waffle cone at House of Flavors then stroll down the pier to the lighthouse." (https://www.salsacycles.com/blogs/articles/coast-to-coast-gravel-grinder-a-new-epic-is-born)

**Race Creator [UNKNOWN LEVEL] - Race Philosophy:** "The Peaceful Northwoods are ripe with nature and solitude –
