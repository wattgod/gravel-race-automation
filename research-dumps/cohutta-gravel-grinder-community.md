## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Neil Beltchenko [UNKNOWN]:** "First day was awesome! It was dry, difficult, slow with lots of thorns, and finally fast. It had everything a bikepacking route should have. The route as a whole is extremely well put together. Beautiful landscapes and amazing primitive dirt and paved roads." (https://bikepacking.com/news/neil-beltchenko-cohutta-cat/)

**Neil Beltchenko [UNKNOWN]:** "Rain started after I left Ducktown, and it unleashed. Glad I brought so many heavy rain layers. Arrived in Blue Ridge at midnight and stripped down at the laundromat to dry all of my clothes, including my shoes." (https://bikepacking.com/news/neil-beltchenko-cohutta-cat/)

**Neil Beltchenko [UNKNOWN]:** "Around 4:30 am on Monday morning, I noticed a horrible shrieking. It was my rear brake. I had shredded through the brake pads. This was an absolute mess to deal with given the sand and muck covering my bike... I threw the new pads in with the screw and it held, but I was very careful when screwing it in." (https://bikepacking.com/news/neil-beltchenko-cohutta-cat/)

**Dylan Johnson [ELITE]:** "My goal for this year was to be as conservative as possible. I knew that I had the edge in the single track over the main players and the course finishes up with 10 miles of single track. If I could stay in the lead group until then I knew that my odds would be good." (https://www.mtbracenews.com/news/cohutta-100-nue-2-2)

**Brian Schworm [ELITE]:** "During a 'moment of inattention' the paced quickened and I found myself off the back of the group and scrambling to catch back up. I caught the main group but Christian and Dylan were gone. My teammate Nathaniel helped to pace me for a while but then I was on my own to chase them down... we were hearing time gaps of nearly 20 minutes to the leading duo." (https://www.mtbracenews.com/news/cohutta-100-nue-2-2)

**Lauren Cantwell [ELITE]:** "First 18 miles of singletrack was a blast! Smooth, flowy, and the dawn mist made for a beautiful way to start the ride. The Death March became a grind towards the end but the views off of the high mountains into the valley were spectacular." (https://www.mtbracenews.com/news/cohutta-100-nue-2-2)

**Heidi Coulter [ELITE]:** "It was a beautiful day riding through the enchanted Cherokee National Forest. After getting DFL at True Grit in Utah, it felt great to finish strong and step up on the podium. Not too shabby for a grandma!" (https://www.mtbracenews.com/news/cohutta-100-nue-2-2)

**Kenny Kocarek [ELITE]:** "At the start line I was so grateful for cooler temps compared to the heat wave of last year... Little did I know since this was the first time on this course that I would be climbing for the next 20 miles!! It was fun until about mile 45. I started to fall behind on nutrition and slowing up the pace of my grind." (https://www.mtbracenews.com/news/cohutta-100-nue-2-2)

**Jeff Barber [ELITE]:** "At some point during the 30-ish mile loop I started feeling really sluggish. I'm not sure if it was the sun or the hard singletrack riding I did in the beginning but my legs were spent. At several points I found myself zig-zagging sections of gravel road that I normally ride straight up with no problem." (https://www.singletracks.com/mtb-tips/my-toughest-ride-yet-19-days-to-cohutta/)

**Jeff Barber [ELITE]:** "During this part of the ascent I started to understand what those 24 hour solo racers mean when they talk about riding in a fog. My mind was blank and I just stared at my front wheel and the dirt in front of it." (https://www.singletracks.com/mtb-tips/my-toughest-ride-yet-19-days-to-cohutta/)

**Will Boulware [COMPETITIVE]:** "The DMR is harder than it looks and it looks pretty hard. I felt like I had decent legs but my lower back did not like the long climbs and I had to stop several times to stretch until it felt better." (https://www.tennesseegravel.com/ride-reports)

**Randy Kerr [COMPETITIVE]:** "Death March Revival - love this route! Yet, another a showcase of God's creations in Cherokee national Forest Cohutta Wilderness." (https://www.tennesseegravel.com/ride-reports)

**Beth Lofgren [COMPETITIVE]:** "I knew it was going to be hot, so I overloaded the fluids carrying 2.5L on the back and 2 -24 oz on the bike." (https://www.tennesseegravel.com/ride-reports)

**Carey Lowery [COMPETITIVE]:** "Having accomplished both a road and virtual Everesting event, I had left to do a gravel version and a single track version... So, what better way to combine the two than doing a yo-yo version of the DMR: riding it clockwise the first lap and counter clockwise the second lap." (https://www.tennesseegravel.com/ride-reports)

**Steve O'Bryan [RECREATIONAL]:** "After a while, we broke out into forest roads. I was actually enjoying the bird songs, the hilly old-growth forest, and the beautiful mountain laurel, which was just starting to bloom." (https://camba.us/wp/archives/6616)

**Steve O'Bryan [RECREATIONAL]:** "However, when I jumped off the bike at the 45-mile aid station, my legs immediately cramped up. I jumped back on the bike, but I could only ride 500 feet before I had to get off and try to stretch it out. I started to walk my bike, hoping that my cramps would calm down." (https://camba.us/wp/archives/6616)

**Steve O'Bryan [RECREATIONAL]:** "About 45 minutes after starting to walk my bike, a 'trail angel' caught up to me. She asked me if I wanted some salt tablets—extending her hand with the tablets as she road past. How did she know? I took the tablets gratefully. Within 20 minutes, I started feeling better and was able to ride." (https://camba.us/wp/archives/6616)

**Matt Kretchmar [UNKNOWN]:** "Unlike the Ohio up/downs which are usually about 1/2 mile long and 200 vertical feet, each of these up/downs was about 500 or more vertical feet over a mile or so. BIG. STEEP. RELENTLESS. CLIMBS." (https://www.ohiogravelgrinders.com/blog/2022/3/27/mulberry-gap-adventure)

**Matt Kretchmar [UNKNOWN]:** "I must add that the people in Georgia were super friendly to cyclists. Drivers were patient, kind and made safe passes. There was almost no hint of aggression, even with big pick up trucks driven in remote Appalachian Rds... And we got chased by exactly 0 dogs in over 180 miles of backroads, rural riding." (https://www.ohiogravelgrinders.com/blog/2022/3/27/mulberry-gap-adventure)

**Cold weather gear [UNKNOWN level]:** Matt Kretchmar wore summer kit with short fingered gloves expecting temperatures to warm quickly on the climb. At the top of Potato Patch Mountain it was 34°F for "another hour or two. I was a frozen popsicle and had a hard time braking with numb fingers." Started at basecamp at 40°F. (https://www.ohiogravelgrinders.com/blog/2022/3/27/mulberry-gap-adventure)

## Weather Experienced

**2018 Cohutta Cat (Neil Beltchenko) [UNKNOWN]:** First day was dry. Rain started after leaving Ducktown and "unleashed." Rain continued through the night requiring a midnight laundromat stop in Blue Ridge to dry all clothes and shoes. Left Blue Ridge at 1:15 AM hoping rain would stop but got drenched again.

**Death March gravel loop:** Described as a 68-mile section. Brian Schworm noted approximately 8-9 riders together starting this loop at the first aid station after 90 minutes of racing. Time gaps to leaders during this section reached nearly 20 minutes. (https://www.mtbracenews.com/news/cohutta-100-nue-2-2)

**Initial singletrack section:** Lauren Cantwell described the first 18 miles as "Smooth, flowy, and the dawn mist made for a beautiful way to start the ride." (https://www.mtbracenews.com/news/cohutta-100-nue-2-2)

**Bull Mountain loop [ELITE perspective]:** Jeff Barber rode it counter-clockwise and noted: "The descent was a blast – I can't believe I usually ride this loop clockwise!" The road ascending from big creek crossing had fastest time out of 10 riders on Strava. He walked "a few of the steepest sections of singletrack near the top, not because I couldn't ride them but because I wanted to save my legs." (https://www.singletracks.com/mtb-tips/my-toughest-ride-yet-19-days-to-cohutta/)

**Winding Stairs descent:** Jeff Barber passed 2-3 cars making their way down the "steep, rocky road and even the descent was painful in my shoulders and quads." (https://www.singletracks.com/mtb-tips/my-toughest-ride-yet-19-days-to-cohutta/)

**Nimblewill Gap Road:** Starts easy with pavement then gravel, gradually ascending before turning up at "a fairly consistent 7% grade until the top of the climb." (https://www.singletracks.com/mtb-tips/my-toughest-ride-yet-19-days-to-cohutta/)

**Potato Patch Mountain climb:** Takes about an hour to climb 1900' in 5 miles. "A lot of the roads were steep pitches of 13% or more." (https://www.ohiogravelgrinders.com/blog/2022/3/27/mulberry-gap-adventure)

**20-mile stretch of abandoned FS road:** "Constantly up/down albeit as a smaller scale." Included a "deep water stream crossing" that required removing shoes and socks in cold temps. (https://www.ohiogravelgrinders.com/blog/2022/3/27/mulberry-gap-adventure)

**Forest Service Rd 55 (Grassy Gap Rd):** Matt Kretchmar described it as "an unmaintained road with deep washout ruts and it was steep (12%) and long (about 7.5 miles total climbing). We slogged up this technical ascent for about an hour." (https://www.ohiogravelgrinders.com/blog/2022/3/27/mulberry-gap-adventure)

**Wildlife encounters:** Neil Beltchenko reported "Lots of wildlife. Bears, deer, rabbits, and possums (I spared one after it ran right in front of me with a skid and a quick maneuver)." (https://bikepacking.com/news/neil-beltchenko-cohutta-cat/)

**Churches:** Neil Beltchenko noted: "So many Churches. Maybe 50-75. Has anyone counted? They all look the same, too. Déjà vu." (https://bikepacking.com/news/neil-beltchenko-cohutta-cat/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Elite pacing strategy [ELITE]:** Dylan Johnson's winning approach (6:43:38 finish): "My goal for this year was to be as conservative as possible. I knew that I had the edge in the single track over the main players and the course finishes up with 10 miles of single track. If I could stay in the lead group until then I knew that my odds would be good... Tanguy was fine to do most of the pulling which was fine with me. When we got to the final single track I got to the front and pushed the pace enough to get a gap." (https://www.mtbracenews.com/news/cohutta-100-nue-2-2)

**Elite nutrition failure at mile 45 [ELITE]:** Kenny Kocarek noted: "It was fun until about mile 45. I started to fall behind on nutrition and slowing up the pace of my grind luckily the drop bag station 3 came up and I reloaded and got my groove back." (https://www.mtbracenews.com/news/cohutta-100-nue-2-2)

**No-sleep strategy [UNKNOWN]:** Neil Beltchenko completed the 290-mile Cohutta Cat with 0 hours slept, 1 hour drying clothes, finishing in 37:11 (32:59 moving time). Go-to food: Snickers bars. Go-to beverage: Red Bull. (https://bikepacking.com/news/neil-beltchenko-cohutta-cat/)

**Elite training pacing [ELITE]:** Jeff Barber's training ride covered 71 miles in "a little over 8 hours on the bike" with 8,500 feet of climbing. He noted this was "1,500 feet more than my biggest day but still well short of the 14,000 feet of climbing at Cohutta." His pace slowed significantly during the ride: completed 30 miles feeling good, then became "really sluggish" during the 30-ish mile Springer Mountain/Winding Stairs loop. (https://www.singletracks.com/mtb-tips/my-toughest-ride-yet-19-days-to-cohutta/)

**Mental strategy advice [COMPETITIVE]:** Dustin Gaddis recommended: "One thing that helps me on long rides, don't think about the whole thing, just break it up into segments. Focus on getting to SAG number whatever as efficiently as possible. Then work on the next chunk. That way you're only thinking about 10-20 miles at a time, so you'll think '4 more miles to the SAG' and not '44 more miles to the finish.'" (https://www.singletracks.com/mtb-tips/my-toughest-ride-yet-19-days-to-cohutta/)

**GPS avoidance strategy [ELITE]:** Jeff Barber reflected: "Perhaps I should stop looking at my GPS when I ride? Based on my performance Saturday I plan on going for one more big ride on the mountain bike before tapering for Cohutta." (https://www.singletracks.com/mtb-tips/my-toughest-ride-yet-19-days-to-cohutta/)

**Competitive multi-day stats:** Matt Kretchmar and Rodney Reed's 3-day training camp totals: Day 1: 93 miles, 10,200' climbing, 12.2mph average. Day 3: 89 miles, 12,500' climbing, 10mph average. (https://www.ohiogravelgrinders.com/blog/2022/3/27/mulberry-gap-adventure)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Electrolyte failure leading to cramping [RECREATIONAL]:** Steve O'Bryan: "I decided to stop at the second rest stop... But when I refilled my CamelBak with water, I forgot to add electrolytes. It turned out to be a critical mistake." At the 45-mile aid station: "when I jumped off the bike at the 45-mile aid station, my legs immediately cramped up. I jumped back on the bike, but I could only ride 500 feet before I had to get off and try to stretch it out. I started to walk my bike, hoping that my cramps would calm down." He walked for approximately 45 minutes before a trail angel gave him salt tablets. Within 20 minutes he could ride again. (https://camba.us/wp/archives/6616)

**Mechanical failures [RECREATIONAL]:** Steve O'Bryan's friend Jim Core "had broken down with derailleur problems... Jim had done a trail-side conversion of his injured bike to a single speed, but soon after that his chain came off and he finished the race on a 'coaster.'" Another friend Dan Mock "had gone down hard on a steep descent on a gravel forest road. His one forearm was shredded with deep road rash." (https://camba.us/wp/archives/6616)

**Brake pad wear [UNKNOWN]:** Neil Beltchenko completely shredded rear brake pads by 4:30 AM on day two of the Cohutta Cat. During replacement, "Some stupidity and lack of thought led me to lean my tire lever on the brake pad screw holder. It sheared right off before my eyes. My heart sank." He managed to complete the race with the compromised setup. (https://bikepacking.com/news/neil-beltchenko-cohutta-cat/)

**Geared bike chain issues [ELITE singlespeed perspective]:** Kenny Kocarek noted his riding partner Michael Gottfried "pulled off the road and starts putting his chain back on his bike (geared bike problems)" during the massive gravel road section. (https://www.mtbracenews.com/news/cohutta-100-nue-2-2)

**Nutrition depletion at mile 45 [ELITE]:** Kenny Kocarek: "I started to fall behind on nutrition and slowing up the pace of my grind" around mile 45. (https://www.mtbracenews.com/news/cohutta-100-nue-2-2)

**Mental fatigue [ELITE]:** Jeff Barber noted: "I tend to get lazy or discouraged when I've come a long way but still have far to go – and that's something I need to work on before the big day." (https://www.singletracks.com/mtb-tips/my-toughest-ride-yet-19-days-to-cohutta/)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Post-race location:** The race is held at the Ocoee Whitewater Center, "a venue that hosted the kayak/canoe slalom competitions at the 1996 Olympic games. Nestled within the Cherokee National Forest." (https://www.mtbracenews.com/news/cohutta-100-nue-2-2)

**Dry county warning:** A rider noted: "One pointer, the town where the race is held is a dry county so BYO for after the race." (https://www.singletracks.com/mtb-tips/my-toughest-ride-yet-19-days-to-cohutta/)

**Trail angels:** Steve O'Bryan encountered a "trail angel" who provided salt tablets when he was cramping and walking his bike at mile 45. (https://camba.us/wp/archives/6616)

**Local driver courtesy [UNKNOWN]:** Matt Kretchmar observed: "I must add that the people in Georgia were super friendly to cyclists. Drivers were patient, kind and made safe passes. There was almost no hint of aggression, even with big pick up trucks driven in remote Appalachian Rds. There were no political ads hanging in peoples yards. There were no confederate flags anywhere. And we got chased by exactly 0 dogs in over 180 miles of backroads, rural riding. People were just kind and respectful to each other in a way that I had totally not expected." (https://www.ohiogravelgrinders.com/blog/2022/3/27/mulberry-gap-adventure)

**Mulberry Gap base facility:** "They have small, but cool cabins, trails on site, bike wash stations, running water and electricity, tent spots, and a mess-hall with breakfast and dinner home cooked meals. The setting is decidedly 'mountain rustic' with no cell reception and only modest, semi-reliable internet service... The camp store looks almost like a fully stocked bike shop and everything I saw at the basecamp was super clean and in proper working condition." (https://www.ohiogravelgrinders.com/blog/2022/3/27/mulberry-gap-adventure)

**Nearby town amenities:** "Never fear, Ellijay GA is just a 20 minute drive away with all the modern amenities of a mid-size town and a cool outdoorsy vibe." (https://www.ohiogravelgrinders.com/blog/2022/3/27/mulberry-gap-adventure)

**Race course appreciation [UNKNOWN]:** Neil Beltchenko: "The route as a whole is extremely well put together. Beautiful landscapes and amazing primitive dirt and paved roads... Thanks to Daniel for the route and all of the Mulberry Gap crew." (https://bikepacking.com/news/neil-beltchenko-cohutta-cat/)
