I need to clarify an important finding from my search results: **The race you're asking about appears to be called "Cohutta 100" (and related events like "Big Frog 65" and "Old Copper 30"), not "Cohutta Gravel Grinder."** The search results consistently refer to these as **endurance mountain bike races**, not gravel races, though they do include some gravel road sections.

Based on the search results provided, here's what I can confirm about the actual Cohutta races:
