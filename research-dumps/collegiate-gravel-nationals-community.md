# COLLEGIATE GRAVEL NATIONALS — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Lizzy Gunsalus [ELITE]:** "It's always an honor to be a national champion. And the last couple of days, I was fortunate enough to win two collegiate national titles, and this one means just as much to me" (https://www.cyclingnews.com/pro-cycling/teams-riders/lizzy-gunsalus-to-debut-us-champions-jersey-at-uci-cyclocross-world-cup-in-antwerp-north-american-roundup/)

*Note: This quote references her collegiate cyclocross national titles from 2025, not gravel nationals. She won collegiate varsity races for Marian University at cyclocross nationals in Fayetteville, Arkansas.*

**Christian Fairly (Race Founder) [UNKNOWN]:** "With the event's growth over the past couple of years, it made sense to partner with USA Cycling and use the great dirt roads of Turkey, Texas for the very first Collegiate Gravel Championships. We already have one of the largest prize purses for the pros and it will be our second year on the USA Cycling Junior Gravel Series calendar, so this is a great addition to an already busy schedule on March 7."

**Terrain Character [UNKNOWN LEVEL]:** Valley of Tears is known for "rugged, hard-packed terrain with sandy sections in the Texas Panhandle" (https://www.cyclingnews.com/pro-cycling/teams-riders/lizzy-gunsalus-to-debut-us-champions-jersey-at-uci-cyclocross-world-cup-in-antwerp-north-american-roundup/)

**Past Weather Impact [UNKNOWN LEVEL]:** In the 2025 elite Valley of Tears race, elite routes were shortened due to muddy and snowy conditions (https://www.cyclingnews.com/pro-cycling/teams-riders/lizzy-gunsalus-to-debut-us-champions-jersey-at-uci-cyclocross-world-cup-in-antwerp-north-american-roundup/)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

The event takes place in Turkey, Texas, a town with a small population of under 500 residents. Despite the small town size, Valley of Tears offers one of the largest prize purses in gravel racing at $26,000 for elite riders (split evenly among pro/open divisions of men and women for the top 10), plus a Friday Criterium with $3,000 prize purse for pro categories (https://www.cyclingnews.com/pro-cycling/teams-riders/lizzy-gunsalus-to-debut-us-champions-jersey-at-uci-cyclocross-world-cup-in-antwerp-north-american-roundup/)

This is the inaugural 2026 USA Cycling Collegiate Gravel National Championships, making March 7, 2026 the first-ever running of this championship (https://www.valleyoftearsgravel.com/2026-collegiate-gravel-national-championships)
