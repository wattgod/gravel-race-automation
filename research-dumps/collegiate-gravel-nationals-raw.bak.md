# COLLEGIATE GRAVEL NATIONALS - RAW RESEARCH DUMP

**SEARCH SUMMARY**
After multiple targeted searches using combinations of "Collegiate Gravel Nationals Turkey Texas", "USA Cycling Collegiate Gravel National Championship", "2025 2026 dates", "registration fees", "course details", and various other keywords, I found **no evidence** that a gravel race called "Collegiate Gravel Nationals" exists in Turkey, Texas.

**WHAT I FOUND INSTEAD**

**USA Cycling Collegiate National Championships**
- USA Cycling does host Collegiate National Championships, but they are primarily for road cycling, mountain biking, and track cycling
- The 2024 Collegiate Road National Championships were held in Albuquerque, New Mexico (May 3-5, 2024) - per USA Cycling website
- The 2024 Collegiate Mountain Bike National Championships were held in Missoula, Montana (October 17-21, 2024) - per USA Cycling website
- No gravel discipline is listed among USA Cycling's collegiate national championship events on their official website

**Turkey, Texas**
- Turkey, Texas is a real town (population ~400) located in the Texas Panhandle
- The town is famous as the home of Bob Wills, the "King of Western Swing"
- No major cycling events or races appear to be held there based on searches of local news and cycling databases

**Gravel Racing in Texas**
- Major Texas gravel races include:
  - The Mid South (Stillwater, Oklahoma - formerly Land Run)
  - Gravel Locos (Hico, Texas)
  - Unbound Gravel (Emporia, Kansas - not Texas but popular with Texas riders)
  - Texas Chainring Massacre (Fort Worth area)

**CONCLUSION**
The "Collegiate Gravel Nationals" race in Turkey, Texas with 62 miles and 4,921 ft elevation appears to be **non-existent**. This could be:
- A hypothetical/fictional race
- A proposed race that never materialized
- A case of mistaken identity with another event
- A very small, unofficial gathering misrepresented as a major race
