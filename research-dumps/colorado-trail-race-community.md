# COLORADO TRAIL RACE — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Nicolette Jones [ELITE]:** "One of the biggest draws to the mountain bike –coming from running and hiking–was the distances you can travel in a day on the bike versus a day on foot... I tried to go into the CTR with a racer's mindset. I had traveled the trail several times before, on foot, skis, and bike, and had made my best guess of what was possible for me (less than six days), but my goal was to win the women's field." (https://www.strafeouterwear.com/blogs/strafe-journal/race-recap-colorado-trail-race)

**Nicolette Jones [ELITE]:** "I slept between 5-3 hours a night during the race, which was a lot more than some of my competitors around me. On the mornings I had service I would check Trackleaders and see the two women closest to me already moving and gaining on me. A few times I had to take quick naps during the day; in the warm afternoon sun a soft patch of grass or pine needles would beckon to me and I would lay down, helmet and backpack still on, set a timer for 10 minutes and drift into a glorious nap before I kept moving." (https://www.strafeouterwear.com/blogs/strafe-journal/race-recap-colorado-trail-race)

**Nicolette Jones [ELITE]:** "12:20pm, day 4: a stop to pee turned into a 20 minute nap when the grass nearby looked too soft to pass up. I was just ahead of the women's record dot when I left Leadville an hour before, but the weight of my eyelids was making it too hard to stay awake even after another nap earlier that morning."

**Nicolette Jones [ELITE]:** "Most of the racers I spoke with had similar experiences throughout their races. And many people can define their experience during the 2025 CTR as an attempt to manage themselves and push hard through daily wildfire smoke. Some people scratched early for concern over their health, some pushed through and ended up hospitalized for smoke related breathing issues, and some of us got lucky, struggled a fair bit but ended up generally alright." (https://walkskicycle.com/?p=1294)

**Anonymous rider [UNKNOWN]:** "Getting up at 3 am was so hard. My head hurt from dehydration and lack of sleep, I was hunger, and so sore!" (https://oneofsevenproject.com/colorado-trail-race-journal/)

**Anonymous rider [UNKNOWN]:** "I came upon 4 hikers packing up, but it turned out one of them was a racer. He got caught in the same storm and didn't have the proper gear. One of the hikers shared his tent and sleeping bag with him. Later he told me he probably would have died if it wasn't for the hikers." (https://oneofsevenproject.com/colorado-trail-race-journal/)

**Anonymous rider [UNKNOWN]:** "The rain turned to sleet and my body started to shake uncontrollable. I didn't get very far before I realized I had to stop and get my tent up so I can try and get warm. I set up my tent right next to the trail and got in. I left my wet bibs on hoping they might dry from my body heat but it was pointless, they were too wet. In a half conscious state I heard a few riders go by and I attempted yelled encouragement. Even after two and a half hours in my sleeping bag I wasn't much warmer and wasn't moving." (https://oneofsevenproject.com/colorado-trail-race-journal/)

**dsieg [UNKNOWN]:** "The Colorado Trail Race was the hardest thing I've ever done. I want more!" (https://www.reddit.com/r/bikepacking/comments/192xipo/the_colorado_trail_race_was_the_hardest_thing_ive/)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Nicolette Jones [ELITE] - Bike Setup:** Vassago Optimus Ti 2019 frame, Shimano XT 1x12 drivetrain, fox stepcast 34 120mm fork, bike yolk revive dropper, Oneup handlebars, Shimano SLX brakes, Reserve 28 rims with DT 350 hubs, 29 x 2.35 Specialized Ground Control Grid Casing tires. "I run heavy, knobby tires, compared to many of my fellow racers, but they work well for me and after wearing through the sidewall on several lighter tire casings I decided to stick with the beefy grid casing." (https://www.strafeouterwear.com/blogs/strafe-journal/race-recap-colorado-trail-race)

**Nicolette Jones [ELITE] - Bags:** "I sewed all of my own bags except for my hydration pack. I used the same EVOC Hydro Pro 1.5 that I use on almost every ride, but I managed to cram a few more snacks in there than I would normally. I ride with a frame bag, a saddle bag (small enough so I can still run my dropper), a handlebar bag, and a small toptube bag. Sewing my own bags means that they are lighter and more simple than most bike packing bags." (https://www.strafeouterwear.com/blogs/strafe-journal/race-recap-colorado-trail-race)

**Nicolette Jones [ELITE] - Repair Kit:** "I did not have any major mechanicals, so I did not have to dip into my repair kit much, but compared to the other riders I talked to, I think I was a little skinny on my repair kit, especially when it came to tubes. I only brought one Tubolito, but I think a more sure bet is to bring two or at least a patchable tube." (https://www.strafeouterwear.com/blogs/strafe-journal/race-recap-colorado-trail-race)

**Nicolette Jones [ELITE] - Clothing:** "I love wearing long sleeves for mountain biking, especially in the alpine, because I despise the feeling of sunscreen but do not like wasting energy on sunburns. The Skyline Tech worked great as a breathable option even on hot days." Listed items included Strafe W's Skyline Tech Long Sleeve, Strafe W's Ridgeline Short, Pearl Izumi Pro Shorts x2, Strafe W's Scout Jacket, Strafe W's Aero Insulator, MontBell Thunderpass Rain Pants. (https://www.strafeouterwear.com/blogs/strafe-journal/race-recap-colorado-trail-race)

**Nicolette Jones [ELITE] - Sleep System:** "My overnight sleep system consisted of all the clothing I brought, a 20 degree Marmot Sleeping bag, a groundsheet and a flat tarp which I would only pitch if I thought it might rain. I left the sleeping pad at home because I find it to be a little cumbersome on the bike (especially in the wind), and except for the night I spent on the wooden cot in the Marshall pass snowmobile cabin, I did not miss it." (https://www.strafeouterwear.com/blogs/strafe-journal/race-recap-colorado-trail-race)

**Anonymous rider [UNKNOWN] - Water Filter Issue:** "Upon using my filter for the first time I noticed how slow it was. On my second stop to filter, it was really bad and cost me time... While at the store I forgot to check online how to back flush my filter. I did a short u-turn hoping to gain some cell service and it actually worked. At the next stream I flushed my filter." (https://oneofsevenproject.com/colorado-trail-race-journal/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Nicolette Jones [ELITE] - Race Stats:** Time: 5 days 12 hours 21 minutes, Total miles ridden: 544.24, Elevation gain: 74,533 ft (22,717 meters). (https://www.strafeouterwear.com/blogs/strafe-journal/race-recap-colorado-trail-race)

**Nicolette Jones [ELITE] - Resupply Strategy:** "There are a lot of resupply options on the CT, one almost every day. At the start I carried too much food, but I was not sure how the first two days would go for me, so I wanted to be prepared to get to Buena Vista in case I rolled through Copper and Leadville while the stores were closed." (https://www.strafeouterwear.com/blogs/strafe-journal/race-recap-colorado-trail-race)

**Nicolette Jones [ELITE] - Nutrition:** "Anytime I have an inclinking of hunger I try to act on it, and when I am at a resupply, I try not to overeat... I ate a lot of gummy candy, sugary granola bars, and apple sauce on the bike. Energy gels were not in the budget this year. I usually drank 2-3 Tailwind drink mixes a day, but I much prefer drinking plain water. At resupplies I could usually down about a half a soda and a serving of prepared food... Like most folks at the end of the race, my mouth was covered in sores from eating so much sugar." (https://www.strafeouterwear.com/blogs/strafe-journal/race-recap-colorado-trail-race)

**Anonymous rider [UNKNOWN] - 7-day finish stats:** 538.9 miles, Durango to Denver, July 23rd - 4am to July 30th - 4:56pm, 7 days 12 hours 56 minutes, Position: 7th out of 68, Average daily mileage: 71.2 miles, Moving average speed: 5.0 mph, Route average speed: 3.0 mph. (https://oneofsevenproject.com/colorado-trail-race-journal/)

**Anonymous rider [UNKNOWN] - Daily mileage variation:** Day 1: 51 miles, Day 2: 41.1 miles, Day 3: 76.5 miles. This shows significant day-to-day variation based on terrain and conditions. (https://oneofsevenproject.com/colorado-trail-race-journal/)

**Anonymous rider [UNKNOWN] - Town resupply time loss:** "I then wasted a lot of time in Silverton. While in town I started my resupply at the gas station, then sat down for breakfast and went to the grocery store." (https://oneofsevenproject.com/colorado-trail-race-journal/)

## Weather Experienced

**2024 Race - Storm on Day 1 (multiple riders):** "By mid afternoon the rain had started and brought a bunch of us back together... The mud was terrible in this section and made forward progress tough." (https://oneofsevenproject.com/colorado-trail-race-journal/)

**2024 Race - Day 2 Hypothermia Incident:** "On the way back up to the race route I saw the black clouds that were behind me earlier. They descended on me half way up. By the time I got back to the race route I was soaked (even with a rain jacket on). By the time I got on the trail again I was near hypothermic. The rain turned to sleet and my body started to shake uncontrollable... The weather was a mixture of snow and rain, and there was lightening too." (https://oneofsevenproject.com/colorado-trail-race-journal/)

**2025 Race - Wildfire Smoke:** "Based on other racers' reports, I made it over Blackhawk pass about an hour ahead of the worst of the smoke on day one (which included raining ash)... I hope that this race report does not make it seem like I gritted through what others could not; for some, it was a matter of health and wellbeing, not toughness." The smoke affected sleep: "the smoke had wrecked my lungs and sinuses again, and I spent half the night blowing snot rockets and hacking up the sticky flem." (https://walkskicycle.com/?p=1294)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**General Route Characteristics:** "The route is 80% unpaved, and 55% is single track. The route's elevation averages over 10,300' (3139m). A very rough estimate has been made that of the 525 mi (845km) about 70 mi (113 km) are HAB (Hike-a-Bike). The tread can vary from smooth single track to extremely rocky." (https://oneofsevenproject.com/colorado-trail-race-faq/)

**Highest Point:** "The highest point is Coney Summit in Segment 22 at 13,271 feet (4045 m)." Segment 22 also has the most elevation gain. (https://oneofsevenproject.com/colorado-trail-race-faq/)

**Total Stats:** "The total elevation gain is 73,437 feet (22,384m) based off the 10k GPX file." (https://oneofsevenproject.com/colorado-trail-race-faq/)

**Day 1 Terrain Experience:** "Throughout the day the single track and views were amazing! If it wasn't for the amount of physical effort required to keep moving in the rain and mud at a race pace, I would have enjoyed the experience more." (https://oneofsevenproject.com/colorado-trail-race-journal/)

**Day 2 Snow and Mud:** "The sun was coming up as I climbed up Rolling Pass. I descended off the pass into a quagmire of snow and mud." (https://oneofsevenproject.com/colorado-trail-race-journal/)

**Stony Pass Climb:** "Next up was the massive climb to Stony Pass. I rode most of the first half but walked a bunch of the second." (https://oneofsevenproject.com/colorado-trail-race-journal/)

**High Altitude Section:** "The first half of the day was brutally hard as I was riding at over 12,000'... After the high point I got to actually ride and it was wonderful. Riding your bike at 12-13,000' in meadows with endless views doesn't get much better." (https://oneofsevenproject.com/colorado-trail-race-journal/)

**Sheep Encounter:** "About 5 miles before Spring Creek Pass I had to ride through the middle of a huge sheep herd." (https://oneofsevenproject.com/colorado-trail-race-journal/)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Navigation Error Leading to Exposure:** "I relied on the app on my phone for which way to go and after going three miles downhill, I realized I had gone the wrong way. On the way back up to the race route I saw the black clouds that were behind me earlier. They descended on me half way up... By the time I got on the trail again I was near hypothermic." This rider notes: "Those three miles were a negative but also a positive. I think if I hadn't missed the turn I would have been higher up when the storm hit, which would me colder temps and more lightening." (https://oneofsevenproject.com/colorado-trail-race-journal/)

**Inadequate Gear for Weather:** One racer "got caught in the same storm and didn't have the proper gear. One of the hikers shared his tent and sleeping bag with him. Later he told me he probably would have died if it wasn't for the hikers." (https://oneofsevenproject.com/colorado-trail-race-journal/)

**Wildfire Smoke Health Issues:** "Some people scratched early for concern over their health, some pushed through and ended up hospitalized for smoke related breathing issues, and some of us got lucky, struggled a fair bit but ended up generally alright." (https://walkskicycle.com/?p=1294)

**Water Filter Malfunction:** Slow or clogged water filters cost time and could become critical in remote sections. (https://oneofsevenproject.com/colorado-trail-race-journal/)

**Sleep Deprivation Early Days:** "Getting up at 3 am was so hard. My head hurt from dehydration and lack of sleep, I was hunger, and so sore!" (https://oneofsevenproject.com/colorado-trail-race-journal/)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Race Format:** "There is no entry fee, no support, no registration, and no prize money. It is a self-timed ITT (Individual Time Trial). All that is provided is a route description, a suggested start time, and a list of results." (https://bikepacking.com/event/2025-colorado-trail-race-ctr/)

**Encouragement from Race Director:** "Jefe Branham maintains a webpage, facebook group, and shows up at the start to send everyone off, an impressive one man show." (https://www.strafeouterwear.com/blogs/strafe-journal/race-recap-colorado-trail-race)

**Rider Acknowledgments:** "A huge thanks to all the people that made this happen: Mark for being my training partner, life partner and best friend; all the riding and skiing buddies for continuing to push me... all the other racers who are the reason I do events like these (special shoutout to Willis, who I was so thankful to have as a riding buddy days 2 and 3); everyone who watched the dots and fueled the stoke; and Jefe for putting in the work to hosting this race." (https://walkskicycle.com/?p=1294)

**Trail Etiquette Emphasis:** "We ask that all racers, and tourers, of the CT use low impact/leave no trace ethos while traveling on the trail and be polite and kind to the other trail users... This is imperative to the future success of this event!!!" (https://jwookieone.com/colorado-trail-race/)

**Rider Support on Trail:** Multiple accounts of riders camping together and encouraging each other during difficult sections. "In a half conscious state I heard a few riders go by and I attempted yelled encouragement." (https://oneofsevenproject.com/colorado-trail-race-journal/)
