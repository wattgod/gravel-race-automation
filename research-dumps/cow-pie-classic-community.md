# COW PIE CLASSIC — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Ken Carl [ELITE]:** "I pulled on my BaseCamp race kit, the green and gray explore kit, a favorite of Tim Cusick. That thought brought a smile. Finished by slipping on the bright yellow race socks. Yep. Could not be better... For me it was the classic tale of two cities. The best of days, the not best of days. Yet I finished 4th in my category. The brightest moment was having our teammates cheering and clapping as I neared the finish line. I could hear them 200 meters away." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/basecamp-strong-at-cow-pie-classic)

**Beth Huffaker [ELITE]:** "So proud of our BaseCamp crew! There are a lot of medals in the house tonight!! Tracy wins the age group and Nancy takes third! Amy takes second in the long haul age group and Allie wins the Athena category for the long haul! Ken, John and I all put in respectable efforts! It was and a blast! Having the BaseCamp crew along was the cherry on top!! Ken asked us to name one thing we love about BaseCamp, without hesitation, we all immediately said, 'The community, this right here!'" (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/basecamp-strong-at-cow-pie-classic)

**Amy Fowler [ELITE]:** "I went to Michigan with Allie Pope Burger to meet up with Tracy, Nancy, Beth, and Ken to race in the Cow Pie Classic gravel race. It was a great weekend of good people and great racing!" (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/basecamp-strong-at-cow-pie-classic)

**John Keepers [ELITE]:** "[He] flew off the line with a serious mission and 300 plus watts" and went on to win his age group. (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/basecamp-strong-at-cow-pie-classic)

**Ivy Audrain [ELITE]:** "Both/all/crashes. Ugh. Its okay, once I decided the race was over and I should just enjoy the ride, I stopped at every aid station to drink beer and fireball with the volunteers and it was amazing. Even made friends with the moto officials following and they took a shot WITH ME AT THE LAST AID STATION LOL. Amazing event, best vibes and unbelievably organized by an amazing team. a must-do for sure!" (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/midwest-events-for-2023/79346?page=17)

**aarono [ELITE]:** "It was perfect conditions. Took my first swing at the Pro / Cat1 race and my word the beginning was a shit show. There were 3 crashes directly in front of me within the first 12 minutes I think. The first one came as we exited the tarmac at the airport and switched to the two track, another crash was right as we entered the real two track before the first single track section." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/midwest-events-for-2023/79346?page=17)

**Haveyoumetzach [UNKNOWN]:** "Weather was about perfect, and the course was fast. There was way more single track this year than previous years, some of it was tight and twisty but overall very smooth and nothing technical. It was fun to ride but hard to pass from wave 12 and the pace took a large hit in the middle of the course." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/midwest-events-for-2023/79346?page=17)

**[deleted] [COMPETITIVE]:** Expressing interest in bringing the whole family to race different distances, specifically mentioning Cow Pie Classic caught their eye with multiple distance options including a 10-mile route for their daughter who is a MISCA racer.

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**MI-XC [ELITE] on tire choice for Barry Roubaix, Melting Mann, and Cow Pie Classic:**

"My responses assume you're mixing it up and racing, not just going for your best time."

On using Continental Grand Prix 5000 AS TR slicks (35mm):

- **Barry Roubaix:** "You can obviously, but it's not the ideal tire, you won't be competitive and you'll lose any group you're in during certain sections. You don't need extra speed on the flats and pavement, you need to make it through key sections and still be with the group or you'll be chasing... about the best of the 3 races to have a slicker tire as long as it's dry. However, you'll struggle on some of the steep pitches and the sandier sections. Also, it will be the sketchiest of the 3 races based on other riders, so I'd want some traction to be able to maneuver and brake. Unless you're one of the strongest in the group you'll likely get dropped."

- **Melting Mann:** "It had a lot more single track this year. If this the theme going forward, along with the most likely poor conditions, a gravel bike is not it especially slicks. Again, you can finish the race, but you won't be competing. This is the worst race of the 3 for slicks. A hardtail MTB on something like Aspens is probably the best bike."

- **Cow Pie Classic:** "Slicks are fine until you go off road into the farms. You will get dropped for sure. There are MTB sections and some very sketchy downhills. I race Cat 1 XCO and MTB 100s and I thought Cow Pie had some scary off road sections. People were taken out by ambulance from that section and someone crashed right in front of me in our group."

Concludes: "Now, if you just want to complete and not compete, than yeah, just rock what you got. Otherwise, choose the right tool for the job." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/midwest-events-for-2023/79346?page=17)

**batwood14 [ELITE] on Barry Roubaix tire choice:** "I usually run 35s in the Barry Roubaix, but I always check the weather and if it looks like there is going to be a lot of rain in the few days leading up to the race, I will switch to 40s. The reason for this is the rain creates a lot of potholes on the BR roads and the extra cushion makes a difference. I'm not sure, however, I would ever run a slick in the BR … even a minimal tread like on the Schwalbe G-One R's (not to be confused with the G-One RS's) is useful. You're going to want a little grip when you hit a patch of sand." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/midwest-events-for-2023/79346?page=17)

**teddygram [ELITE]:** "I have done all (3) races [Barry Roubaix, Melting Mann, Cow Pie] and I have been using the Cinturato H tires for all of them and honestly I have never had any issues with them in any conditions. I honestly have never changed from these tires even in complete slop/mud races... They are beyond wore out now so its time for a new set of something for next season. The Terra Speed or honestly try a Raceking as my top contender for next season if I wanted to try something new." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/midwest-events-for-2023/79346?page=17)

**Tire sizing note:** teddygram mentions that on 30mm internal width rims, a 35mm tire "blows out to 40 actual." MN_XC notes 35mm Panaracer GKs "eventually balloon out to 38 on my 21 ID rims." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/midwest-events-for-2023/79346?page=17)

## Weather Experienced

**Iceman 2023 [ELITE reports]:** "Weather was about perfect, and the course was fast... picture perfect weather" (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/midwest-events-for-2023/79346?page=17)

**Ken Carl race day [ELITE]:** "Race day. Cool and perfect. A quiet awaking... Finished by slipping on... the bright yellow race socks. Yep. Could not be better... under a perfect blue sky morning" (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/basecamp-strong-at-cow-pie-classic)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Farm sections - Official course description:** "The 34 mile race is 80% gravel, 10% pavement, and 10% farm! After leaving the 1st farm you will be 9 miles from the finish but wait, there's another farm! No 'Bull' in 2022 we replaced 2 miles of fast pavement still in the rec ride and 10 mile. the short haul gets another private property section and two dead end roads with farmland 2 track and fred meijer trail. the short haul boast multiple dead end roads, 2 seperate farm sections, limestone rail trail, a 800 meter 2 track section that will give you single track smiles, and plenty of fast gravel roads!" (https://www.ridecowpie.com/)

**Long Haul (62 miles):** "The Long Haul will share the short haul route until 3 miles past Woodard lake where you make a break north and go past a cool long haul only farm. miles 20-50 will be secluded gravel roads and Jessup road! around 50 miles in the route re-joins the short haul course by turning south on Powell, Then the farm! 9 miles to go to the finish including another farm!" (https://www.ridecowpie.com/)

**Bodacious Century (105 miles):** "aptly named after 'the worlds most dangerous bull'. the bodacious century is 105 miles of the best gravel around the Grand and maple river. tons of tree covered hardpacked roads with private property sections scattered in at 6.5, 85 and 92 mile marks. hyde, tallman, jessup and welch will be difference maker hills that take the rolling out of the continuous rolling gravel this route offers." (https://www.ridecowpie.com/)

**MI-XC [ELITE] on Cow Pie farm sections:** "Slicks are fine until you go off road into the farms. You will get dropped for sure. There are MTB sections and some very sketchy downhills. I race Cat 1 XCO and MTB 100s and I thought Cow Pie had some scary off road sections. People were taken out by ambulance from that section and someone crashed right in front of me in our group." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/midwest-events-for-2023/79346?page=17)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**John Keepers [ELITE] start strategy:** "He flew off the line with a serious mission and 300 plus watts. I could only wish watching him crest the second hill. My plan of staying with him ended before it started." Won his age group with this approach. (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/basecamp-strong-at-cow-pie-classic)

**Passing difficulties [UNKNOWN level]:** "It was fun to ride but hard to pass from wave 12 and the pace took a large hit in the middle of the course." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/midwest-events-for-2023/79346?page=17)

**Pro/Cat 1 race start chaos [ELITE]:** "Took my first swing at the Pro / Cat1 race and my word the beginning was a shit show. There were 3 crashes directly in front of me within the first 12 minutes I think. The first one came as we exited the tarmac at the airport and switched to the two track, another crash was right as we entered the real two track before the first single track section." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/midwest-events-for-2023/79346?page=17)

**Wave structure for 2026:** "riders will have the option to sign up for the Free range flyers wave or the finishers wave. this is different from previous years where we had elite and sport. the Finisher waves will get a participation medal for your race and we are excited to celebrate your accomplishment with you. the free range flyer waves will compete for over $10,000 in cash prizes" (https://www.ridecowpie.com/)

**aarondeutchman [UNKNOWN] on competitive level for shorter distance:** "I plan to be in the longer distance next year and the same is true for most of the top 5 in that video. The next group was 5 min back. You would do pretty well around 4wkg I think, motivation for training this winter." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/midwest-events-for-2023/79346?page=17)

## DNF Risk Factors

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Ken Carl [ELITE]:** "Dinner that evening was a joyful affair. Everyone brought something delicious to the table. I could only wish every pre-race meal was this nourishing for both body and soul. John sent us to our dreams with several songs relaxing our pre-race thoughts... The soul glow of that moment was only eclipsed by the knowledge that many of our team did stand proud on the podium. First, second, and third places popping like fire works. A wonderful evening of wine, stories and the good stuff of life brought this Base Camp chapter to a close."
