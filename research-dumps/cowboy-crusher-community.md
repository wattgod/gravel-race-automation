## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Mormon Canyon (Early Climb):**
"As you head southward and ascend Mormon Canyon you will start a conversation with yourself that goes something like this...'Wow, beautiful scenery'....'Wow, shut up legs'. Just keep pedaling and before you know it you are out of the canyon and feeling like you are on top of the world." (https://www.cowboycrusher.com/faqs)

**Mormon Canyon Water Stop:** Mile 10 - "This is a little early, but you climb 1,700 ft. to get here" (https://www.cowboycrusher.com/faqs)

**Pavement Section:** "Approximately 20 miles of pavement will give you a small reprieve" in the Cowboy 121 before turning westward toward Ayers Natural Bridge Park (https://cowboycrush.itsyourrace.com/)

**Windy Ridge Road Climb (Late-Race Challenge):** 
"Be sure to save a little in the tank as this climb is a doozy. Once on top, you have a few more miles of gravel until the sweet descent down Boxelder Canyon and into Glenrock and across the finish line." (https://cowboycrush.itsyourrace.com/)

**Boxelder Canyon Descent (Finish):**
"Hold on as you rip back down into Glenrock and the finish line" - described for Mutton Buster route (https://cowboycrush.itsyourrace.com/)

**Abandoning the Race:**
"If you are going to abandon the race you must make it to an official aid station/checkpoint, and then call for your support crew to come get you or take a ride back to Glenrock with a SAG wagon when it is available." (https://www.cowboycrusher.com/faqs)

**Checkout Requirement:**
"If for some reason you abandon the race you MUST check in at the timing table to let event organizers know you are no longer on course" (https://www.cowboycrusher.com/faqs)
