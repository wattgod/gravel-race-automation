The weather was great, a bit of rain but overall mostly cloudy, which was nice."

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**General equipment advice [RECREATIONAL/ALL LEVELS]:** "The best type of bike to use is one with fatter tires to allow for lower pressures, enhancing comfort and performance on gravel. Suitable options include gravel bikes, cyclocross bikes, mountain bikes, hybrid bikes, touring bikes, and even road bikes or e-bikes, although road bikes might be less comfortable due to high tire pressures and hard gearing."
