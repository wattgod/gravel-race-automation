# CROATAN BUCK FIFTY — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Chris Spurrier [RECREATIONAL]:** "Croatan was an excellent opportunity to push myself physically and prove I had some early season fitness. More so being three loops, I had the chance to test some nutrition and technique without fear of being left stranded on the road... I am however a little disappointed that I felt good at the end. That's a good thing, right? Well for the end goal yes, but I still had something to give, and I didn't give it." (https://kylecoaching.com/race-croatan-buck-fifty-chris-spurrier-2/)

**Mastering the Uphill Shift blogger [ELITE]:** "I do not fit in the typical demographic for races, as I'm fat and slow. I worry most about judgement and pity — *I* don't care much that I'm fat and slow, but I can't help but wonder what others think. Then we got some emails that mentioned 'peloton' and 'motor pacing' and I got even MORE anxious, as I worried my slow pace would mean I would be dropped like a hot potato and constantly passed by faster riders." (https://masteringtheuphillshift.wordpress.com/2018/04/05/the-croatan-buck-fifty/)

**Mastering the Uphill Shift [ELITE]:** "I decided the best way to tackle this section was to put my head down and power through. Instead of a 13-14 mph goal, I was now aiming for a 15-16 mph goal... At the turnaround point, I didn't stop long. I stretched, used the bathroom (which was the most vile bathroom I've ever been in my LIFE), ate some GORMP, got some electrolytes for my water, and pressed on." (https://masteringtheuphillshift.wordpress.com/2018/04/05/the-croatan-buck-fifty/)

**Lifebybicycle blogger [UNKNOWN]:** "After a quick pre-race announcement, we rolled out for a neutral start around the track and out onto the road. The neutral pace was pretty quick, as even the back was rolling at about 20 mph... Once we turned off the pavement onto gravel (a mile or so?), the field started to split pretty quickly." (https://lifebybicycle.blogspot.com/2018/03/croatan-buck-fifty-race-report.html)

**Dudeonabike [UNKNOWN]:** "I figured since the race takes place in the Croatan National Forest in Eastern North Carolina and is mostly flat I would crush it... They did not have a fixed gear division so I just signed up for the single speed division. But I rode the race on a fixed gear. This proved a wise choice. I had so much fun bombing down the forest roads and passing the other racers." (https://www.dudeonabike.com/2024/05/croatan-buck-fifty.html)

**Dudeonabike [UNKNOWN]:** "There was a fellow racer who thought he could bypass the traffic by taking a 'wetter' line. That guy literally was swallowed by what I can only assume was an eight foot deep mud puddle." (https://www.dudeonabike.com/2024/05/croatan-buck-fifty.html)

**Lifebybicycle blogger [UNKNOWN]:** "Once I exited Savage Road, I immediately stopped and took a break — I really just needed to unclench my body from the bike and give my lady-bits a reprieve from the saddle! At around mile 35, the course was on pavement for a bit. Once back on pavement, I realized how mental exhausting it is to ride on gravel. You can't let your mind wander, you always need to be paying attention to road conditions, on the look out for potholes, patches of loose gravel, other obstacles." (https://lifebybicycle.blogspot.com/2018/03/croatan-buck-fifty-race-report.html)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Tire Pressure - Mastering the Uphill Shift [ELITE]:** "Between the rough road and the craters, I couldn't keep any speed which made this section miserable. Between the rough road and the craters, I couldn't keep any speed which made this 3 mile section feel like an eternity! It was hard packed, uneven dirt and because I had slightly too much air in my tires, I was being thrown around, bouncing all over. This was hell on my undercarriage." Note: Rider suggests running lower tire pressure than initially chosen. (https://masteringtheuphillshift.wordpress.com/2018/04/05/the-croatan-buck-fifty/)

**Frame Bag - Chris Spurrier [RECREATIONAL]:** "I was able to successfully navigate my frame bag at race pace freeing up the comfort factor of carrying less crap in my pockets. My Quarq Tyrewiz monitors proved to be invaluable during the race as the conditions would change and I had eyes on that my tires were solid." (https://kylecoaching.com/race-croatan-buck-fifty-chris-spurrier-2/)

**Cold Weather Layers - Mastering the Uphill Shift [ELITE]:** "I ended up with knee warmers, arm warmers, a vest, buff around the ears, mid-weight thermal gloves, and toe warmers in my shoes. I am glad that I brought as much stuff as I did, because by the time I fired up my Wahoo Elemnt Bolt, it was a frosty 36 degrees out!" (https://masteringtheuphillshift.wordpress.com/2018/04/05/the-croatan-buck-fifty/)

**Single Speed Gearing - Dudeonabike [UNKNOWN]:** "I ran a lower gear, still fixed gear. The lower gear was great in the cornfield and other tough spots, but I felt really limited on many stretches of smooth gravel... In 2023... I changed things up a bit and actually ran a freewheel single speed. It was higher geared than 2022 which was helpful." (https://www.dudeonabike.com/2024/05/croatan-buck-fifty.html)

**Lights Requirement:** Race website notes "2pm LIGHTS REQUIRED IF DEPARTING FOR FINAL LAP" indicating riders need to carry lights for late finishes. (https://croatanbuckfifty.com/)

## Weather Experienced

**March 2018 - Mastering the Uphill Shift [ELITE]:** "When we arrived at the Speedway Saturday morning, I realized I had grossly underestimated the still-winter weather of North Carolina... it was damn cold at the start line with bare legs! Until about 9:30, it was a very cold ride, with frozen toes... it was a frosty 36 degrees out!" (https://masteringtheuphillshift.wordpress.com/2018/04/05/the-croatan-buck-fifty/)

**March 2018 - Lifebybicycle [UNKNOWN]:** "At 1:30(ish) in the afternoon on Thursday, March 15th, I left the DC area behind with temperatures in the low 40's and the wind whipping the trees. I was headed south to Emerald Isle, NC... Friday's weather was perfect, and became sweeter once we realized there was snow in the DC area!" (https://lifebybicycle.blogspot.com/2018/03/croatan-buck-fifty-race-report.html)

**March 2018 - Lifebybicycle [UNKNOWN]:** "About 10 miles from the speedway, I caught up with an old friend... I slowed and chatted with him for a bit... was nearing the finish of the Hundred, came up behind me then" noting wind was "picking up" during the second lap. (https://lifebybicycle.blogspot.com/2018/03/croatan-buck-fifty-race-report.html)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Savage Road - Mastering the Uphill Shift [ELITE]:** "This is a stretch of un-maintained roads, full of huge craters full of water — nasty looking water. The water could be 3 inches deep or 3 feet and I was not interested in finding out! There was a line ridden in by previous riders, tracing a path around the craters. But some of those lines were very narrow and/or right on the edge of giant crater... between the crater sections. It was hard packed, uneven dirt... this 3 mile section feel like an eternity!" (https://masteringtheuphillshift.wordpress.com/2018/04/05/the-croatan-buck-fifty/)

**Savage Road - Dudeonabike [UNKNOWN]:** "A lot of folks were dreading the section colloquially known as 'Savage Road'. This section was no joke. There was a lot of puddles, and you would be wise to avoid them as some were quite deep. You really had to choose a good dry line and inevitably that line would crisscross from left to right and back again. I got stuck in some traffic as the good lines were often only wide enough for a single rider." (https://www.dudeonabike.com/2024/05/croatan-buck-fifty.html)

**The Long Straight Section - Mastering the Uphill Shift [ELITE]:** "At mile 20, I rounded a slight bend in the road and saw before me the whitest, flattest, straightest section of road so far and knew these last 3 miles to the turnaround were going to be brutal. This would be the first of three really (mentally and physically) tough sections." (https://masteringtheuphillshift.wordpress.com/2018/04/05/the-croatan-buck-fifty/)

**Overall Terrain - Lifebybicycle [UNKNOWN]:** "Our average speed was a little below 18 mph, which was incredible but completely doable in a group. However, once we got to the technical section, the folks in front of me started to slow down and ride much more cautiously... the woman that was directly in front of me freaked out at one point, got off her bike and walked a section. It was relatively narrow and there was generally one line, so no passing." (https://lifebybicycle.blogspot.com/2018/03/croatan-buck-fifty-race-report.html)

**Pavement Sections - Mastering the Uphill Shift [ELITE]:** "At around mile 35, the course was on pavement for a bit. Once back on pavement, I realized how mental exhausting it is to ride on gravel. You can't let your mind wander, you always need to be paying attention to road conditions, on the look out for potholes, patches of loose gravel, other obstacles. It was a relief to let my mind go blank for a bit." (https://masteringtheuphillshift.wordpress.com/2018/04/05/the-croatan-buck-fifty/)

**Course Layout:** The race consists of 46.4 mile laps: "THE FIFTY - 46.4 miles - ONE 46.4 Mile Lap / THE BUCK - 92.8 Miles - TWO 46.4 MILE Laps / THE BUCK FIFTY - 139.2 Miles - THREE 46.4 Mile LAPS" with "Black Swamp Aid Station at Mile 23" serving as the turnaround. (https://croatanbuckfifty.com/)

**Private Property Warning:** "DO NOT RIDE THE FARM BYPASS OR THE CORNFIELD BYPASS PRIOR TO RACE WEEKEND! THOSE ARE PRIVATE PROPERTY AND YOU WILL ENDANGER OUR ABILITY TO USE THE ACCESS RACE WEEKEND." (https://croatanbuckfifty.com/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Pacing Goals - Mastering the Uphill Shift [ELITE]:** "Based on that last training ride, my goal was to keep at 13-14 mph pace as much as could and finish hopefully in the 4 to 5 hour range... I was doing so well maintaining my 13-14 mph pace and feeling very proud of myself!" Note: This is for the 50-mile distance. (https://masteringtheuphillshift.wordpress.com/2018/04/05/the-croatan-buck-fifty/)

**Pacing Strategy on Tough Sections - Mastering the Uphill Shift [ELITE]:** "I decided the best way to tackle this section was to put my head down and power through. Instead of a 13-14 mph goal, I was now aiming for a 15-16 mph goal. Based on Strava I met that goal." (https://masteringtheuphillshift.wordpress.com/2018/04/05/the-croatan-buck-fifty/)

**Nutrition - Chris Spurrier [RECREATIONAL]:** "I was able to stretch two bottles of GU hydration for about two and a half hours. I also found a good mixture of chews, waffles, and gels during the same period. As I expected, I was craving a little more real food by the fifth hour." (https://kylecoaching.com/race-croatan-buck-fifty-chris-spurrier-2/)

**Bike Handling Skills - Mastering the Uphill Shift [ELITE]:** "It was here I was so thankful for that 1 and a half seasons of cross I had under my belt. I never would have felt confident enough to navigate some of the trickier lines without the bike handling skills I'd picked up in cross." Recommends cyclocross experience for technical sections. (https://masteringtheuphillshift.wordpress.com/2018/04/05/the-croatan-buck-fifty/)

**Group Riding Challenges - Lifebybicycle [UNKNOWN]:** "I have a lot to learn about pace-line riding. Especially in gravel with lots of pot holes. Eventually I got in with a group that was lead by teammate... I settled into their pace even though I would have liked to have pushed it just a bit harder." (https://lifebybicycle.blogspot.com/2018/03/croatan-buck-fifty-race-report.html)

**Solo vs Group - Lifebybicycle [UNKNOWN]:** "A woman named Libby ended up grabbing my wheel at some point and we chatted for a few minutes... We rode together pretty much the rest of that lap. She on my wheel the majority of the time." vs "The second lap was pretty lonely. I did end up passing a guy on the one hill on the course and he grabbed my wheel but refused to trade pulls. I was a bit annoyed with that, so when I rolled through the aid/turn around, I dropped him." (https://lifebybicycle.blogspot.com/2018/03/croatan-buck-fifty-race-report.html)

**Start Positioning - Lifebybicycle [UNKNOWN]:** "Lining up, I still have a tendency to hang out in the back. Mass starts scare the crap out of me. AND... I still kind of suck at starts. But mostly, it is because mass starts are usually a giant cluster of testosterone and terrible bike handling skills." (https://lifebybicycle.blogspot.com/2018/03/croatan-buck-fifty-race-report.html)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Energy Fade - Mastering the Uphill Shift [ELITE]:** "I could feel myself starting to fade and when I turned back onto the gravel around mile 37, I was able to keep up a good 13-14 mph pace for only a mile or two. After that, I struggled to keep above 10 mph! I was losing energy and power." Note: This was during the 50-mile race. (https://masteringtheuphillshift.wordpress.com/2018/04/05/the-croatan-buck-fifty/)

**Physical Discomfort - Mastering the Uphill Shift [ELITE]:** "It was hard on the body to stay in the same position on the bike for so long, both my arms and undercarriage suffered from the flat and bumpy terrain." (https://masteringtheuphillshift.wordpress.com/2018/04/05/the-croatan-buck-fifty/)

**Mental Challenges - Mastering the Uphill Shift [ELITE]:** "You can't let your mind wander, you always need to be paying attention to road conditions, on the look out for potholes, patches of loose gravel, other obstacles. It was a relief to let my mind go blank for a bit while riding on the pavement." Notes the mental fatigue of constant attention on gravel. (https://masteringtheuphillshift.wordpress.com/2018/04/05/the-croatan-buck-fifty/)

**Savage Road Crashes - Dudeonabike [UNKNOWN]:** "There was a fellow racer who thought he could bypass the traffic by taking a 'wetter' line. That guy literally was swallowed by what I can only assume was an eight foot deep mud puddle." (https://www.dudeonabike.com/2024/05/croatan-buck-fifty.html)

**Drivetrain Issues - Lifebybicycle [UNKNOWN]:** "No one was disappointed (except maybe my drive train!)" suggesting mechanical issues occurred during the race. (https://lifebybicycle.blogspot.com/2018/03/croatan-buck-fifty-race-report.html)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Pre-Race Atmosphere - Lifebybicycle [UNKNOWN]:** "Just checking in to the race venue gave you a sense that this was going to be an epic blast. The atmosphere, the staff, and volunteers, everything screamed epic." (https://lifebybicycle.blogspot.com/2018/03/croatan-buck-fifty-race-report.html)

**Weekend Experience - Lifebybicycle [UNKNOWN]:** "I was more than excited to get away from the city and work to spend the weekend on a long bike ride with awesome people. In addition, I was even MORE excited to be part of this first time race put on by a long time friend of mine (that would be the one and only Quadsworth). I was so excited that when he first posted about the race, I poked and prodded all my friends and talked it up. I was thrilled that so many folks wanted to come down and support this adventure and suffer with me." (https://lifebybicycle.blogspot.com/2018/03/croatan-buck-fifty-race-report.html)

**Beach Town Location - Lifebybicycle [UNKNOWN]:** "The house that we rented for the long weekend (THANKS ANNA!) was amazing... It was perfect for us, our bikes, and my dogs." Multiple references to beach walks, seafood, and ocean access during race weekend. (https://lifebybicycle.blogspot.com/2018/03/croatan-buck-fifty-race-report.html)

**Growth Over Years - Dudeonabike [UNKNOWN]:** "Back in 2019, the race was smaller than it is now days. It also had a more laid back atmosphere, at least to me it did. Its still not very pretentious or anything and everyone I encountered was super cool. But I mean they did have free beer from Crank Arm Brewing out of Raleigh back then and I don't think I've seen that since... In 2023 the fifty single speed had grown to 14 beastly competitors... There were more people here for the race than I had seen before." (https://www.dudeonabike.com/2024/05/croatan-buck-fifty.html)

**Supportive Environment - Mastering the Uphill Shift [ELITE]:** "However, in spite of my anxiety, I was looking forward to a long weekend to enjoy my friends, bikes, and beaches... Friday's weather was perfect, and became sweeter once we realized there was snow in the DC area!" (https://masteringtheuphillshift.wordpress.com/2018/04/05/the-croatan-buck-fifty/)

**Team Support - Lifebybicycle [UNKNOWN]:** "At mile 18, the lead group finally caught us going the opposite direction... Once I had been 'lapped' it was actually kind of fun, as my friends who are faster than me (all of them!) were now periodically passing me going the other direction! Every time a Bikenetic team member would pass (even if I didn't know them personally!) I would shout 'HI!'. It was energizing to see my friends and helped keep it from being too boring." (https://lifebybicycle.blogspot.com/2018/03/croatan-buck-fifty-race-report.html)

**Charitable Component:** Race is a "Proud Supporter of Wounded Warrior Project Soldier Ride" (https://croatanbuckfifty.com/)
