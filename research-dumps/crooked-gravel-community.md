# CROOKED GRAVEL — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Ashley Darah [ELITE]:** "I started biking competitively when I joined the Colorado University triathlon team my freshman year of college in 2019... I competed at Unbound Gravel in Emporia, Kansas, in early June, which is one of the biggest (if not the biggest) gravel event in the entire world. I raced the 100-mile and placed seventh overall." She finished 3rd overall at Crooked Gravel. "I had really gutted myself, and I was very proud of how I handled the race. And it was so awesome to do it in my family's backyard." (https://www.skyhinews.com/news/guest-column-a-wonderful-day-spent-in-grand-county-at-crooked-gravel/)

**Ashley Darah [ELITE]** on the technical descent: "When we hit the technical downhill after the first ascent, I was not prepared at all. It was pretty rocky with a lot of potholes. My first goal was to avoid a crash and keep rubber down. My second goal was to just get through it quickly and not lose time." (https://www.skyhinews.com/news/guest-column-a-wonderful-day-spent-in-grand-county-at-crooked-gravel/)

**Ashley Darah [ELITE]** on the final climb: "I really should have paid more attention to the elevation maps beforehand. I started the climb thinking it would be punchy like the rest were, but then after 20 or so minutes, I realized that I don't think this is a punchy climb. In fact, it was a very long climb. The heat of the day was setting in, and it was honestly kinda brutal." (https://www.skyhinews.com/news/guest-column-a-wonderful-day-spent-in-grand-county-at-crooked-gravel/)

**Colonel (handle) [ELITE]:** "I had trained on courses such as Dirty Bizmark around Marshall Mesa, and while 'rough', the route is relatively smooth – you just need to dodge the knobby rocks. Crooked course was different. It was teeth chattering rough. I felt I had to pump my brakes for fear of losing control." (https://www.exploringtherockies.com/2023/08/03/2023-crooked-gravel-race/)

**Colonel [ELITE]** on descending skills: "This is where I was officially introduced to what a gravel race is all about – those who can handle the downhills and those who can't. I fell somewhere in between... After speaking with a few post-race and reading some Strava posts, most of the riders in the front or sub-4 hour range just went 'full send'. Maybe one day I'll get there, it just seemed a little insane to me." (https://www.exploringtherockies.com/2023/08/03/2023-crooked-gravel-race/)

**Colonel [ELITE]** on difficulty perception: "I found riding on flattish gravel/dirt was more difficult than riding on a slight uphill (5-6% grade) on paved asphalt." (https://www.exploringtherockies.com/2023/08/03/2023-crooked-gravel-race/)

**Colonel [ELITE]** on the Blue Ridge climb: "At some point CR-50 parallels 'The Blue Ridge' which is this massive, never ending ridge... It never really got all that steep, it just went on forever. It was basically 11 miles of a 5-10% grade…..for eternity. It was around this time of the race when the temps started to get pretty hot (70-75) and then the nail in the coffin were the biting flies. They almost broke me." (https://www.exploringtherockies.com/2023/08/03/2023-crooked-gravel-race/)

**Colonel [ELITE]** on goal adjustment: "It was somewhere along this section where I switched my race goal from sub-5 hours to just staying on the bike the whole time. This proved to be kind of a dumb new goal cause remaining on the bike I think ultimately hurt me as my back, arms and ass really suffered." He finished at 5:03. (https://www.exploringtherockies.com/2023/08/03/2023-crooked-gravel-race/)

**Ben Delaney [ELITE]:** "Friends have asked if they could ride their road bikes at Wild Horse. No. No, you should not. Some of the terrain is pretty rough, especially at speed, and you would be miserable at best if not plain out of luck and walking with a road bike." [Note: This quote is about Wild Horse Gravel, a sister event, but speaks to the terrain character of these Colorado gravel events] (https://velo.outsideonline.com/road/road-racing/the-grind-new-routes-and-5000-purses-for-crooked-gravel-wild-horse-gravel)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**[ELITE] — Canyon CF SL7 Grizl:** Colonel rode a Canyon CF SL7 Grizl, chosen because "it was $1,000 cheaper than the Trek Checkpoint I had been eyeing, with almost the exact same components, weight and tire clearance." He specifically wanted "the widest tires I could find on the market" and was "tired of swapping out the tires on my Trek Domane." (https://www.exploringtherockies.com/2023/08/03/2023-crooked-gravel-race/)

**Official recommendations:** "I'd still recommend a 40mm tire and low gears. Climbing at elevation is a challenge." (https://geminiadventures.com/bike/crooked-gravel)

**Bottles:** Colonel noted "I have never seen so many people lose water bottles before by just getting too jostled around. That added some extra obstacles." (https://www.exploringtherockies.com/2023/08/03/2023-crooked-gravel-race/)

**[ELITE] — Cleat positioning:** Colonel experienced "sore feet soles cause the cleats on my shoes were too far forward, which was resulting in some nagging stress pain" during the long Blue Ridge climb. (https://www.exploringtherockies.com/2023/08/03/2023-crooked-gravel-race/)

## Weather Experienced

**2023 conditions [ELITE report]:** Colonel experienced heat during the final climb: "temps started to get pretty hot (70-75)" and noted "biting flies" became a major factor on the Blue Ridge climb. (https://www.exploringtherockies.com/2023/08/03/2023-crooked-gravel-race/)

**General expectations:** "Weather in the Colorado mountains is very unpredictable. The average high temperature is 73F and a low of 44F. You can count on afternoon showers, and you should be prepared by carrying rain gear." (https://geminiadventures.com/bike/crooked-gravel)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Opening section [ELITE]:** "We got a police escort down CO-40 through Winter Park and Frisco, took a left at the light where the Safeway is and hit dirt soon after on County Rd 73. Not too long after hitting 73, the peloton (which was breaking up rapidly between the elites and the weekend warriors) took a hard right on to Cty Rd 50S, otherwise known as 'Crooked Creek Rd'." (https://www.exploringtherockies.com/2023/08/03/2023-crooked-gravel-race/)

**Post-Aid #1 descent [ELITE]:** "The road beyond Aid 1 started off fine. I tailed a couple guys through some smooth'ish flowy gravel. It quickly turned to washboard and even got a tad technical at times." (https://www.exploringtherockies.com/2023/08/03/2023-crooked-gravel-race/)

**Descent character [ELITE]:** "Flying 25-30mph down a rough dirt road with no suspension is a tad confusing." Colonel notes the rough sections were "teeth chattering rough" compared to his training routes around Marshall Mesa. (https://www.exploringtherockies.com/2023/08/03/2023-crooked-gravel-race/)

**Keyser Creek section [ELITE]:** "The course started to noticeably get smoother once we hit the Keyser Creek section. All I was concerned with around this part was potholes hidden in the shade. But this section definitely allowed you to open it up a bit more." (https://www.exploringtherockies.com/2023/08/03/2023-crooked-gravel-race/)

**North Park Valley [ELITE]:** "Once the course reached the Horseshoe Campground, it was paved dirt along the southern boundary of the North Park Valley. Views here were nice and riding was more casual through a section of rolling hills all the way to US-40." (https://www.exploringtherockies.com/2023/08/03/2023-crooked-gravel-race/)

**Blue Ridge climb [ELITE]:** "The grunt up CR-50 started off casually through a lush valley along 'Beaver Creek' (no relation to the ski resort). I was able to actually start passing quite a few people as I had lots of fuel from Aid #2 propelling me forward. This wouldn't last. At some point CR-50 parallels 'The Blue Ridge' which is this massive, never ending ridge... It never really got all that steep, it just went on forever. It was basically 11 miles of a 5-10% grade…..for eternity." (https://www.exploringtherockies.com/2023/08/03/2023-crooked-gravel-race/)

**Potholes throughout [ELITE]:** Ashley Darah noted: "Though, in Colorado style, there were so many potholes! On the neutral start on road, everyone was very communicative which was helpful, but never in my life have I bunny-hopped so much while on a race course." (https://www.skyhinews.com/news/guest-column-a-wonderful-day-spent-in-grand-county-at-crooked-gravel/)

**Technical downhill surprise [ELITE]:** "I really should have paid more attention to the map beforehand because when we hit the technical downhill after the first ascent, I was not prepared at all. It was pretty rocky with a lot of potholes." (https://www.skyhinews.com/news/guest-column-a-wonderful-day-spent-in-grand-county-at-crooked-gravel/)

**Smooth gravel section [ELITE]:** "Once we got through the technical stuff, we hit some smooth gravel that felt like butter." (https://www.skyhinews.com/news/guest-column-a-wonderful-day-spent-in-grand-county-at-crooked-gravel/)

**Final descent [ELITE]:** "Once I crested the summit, I had about 10 miles of downhill until the end of the timed finish. On that section, I was trying to move quickly, but there were also some holes and rocks on a couple switchbacks that added a little spice." (https://www.skyhinews.com/news/guest-column-a-wonderful-day-spent-in-grand-county-at-crooked-gravel/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**[ELITE] — Goal setting:** Colonel's initial goal was "to finish in under 5 hours" but he adjusted mid-race: "somewhere along this section where I switched my race goal from sub-5 hours to just staying on the bike the whole time." He finished at 5:03. (https://www.exploringtherockies.com/2023/08/03/2023-crooked-gravel-race/)

**[ELITE] — Descending strategy:** Colonel admits: "I felt I had to pump my brakes for fear of losing control" while "most of the riders in the front or sub-4 hour range just went 'full send'." This suggests a significant time differential between conservative and aggressive descending approaches. (https://www.exploringtherockies.com/2023/08/03/2023-crooked-gravel-race/)

**[ELITE] — Positioning matters:** Ashley Darah: "Once we hit gravel and the timed section started, it was super fun. We were going at a pretty good pace, and I was really focused on putting myself in a good position. I was trying to count the women around me to get an idea of where I was in the race." (https://www.skyhinews.com/news/guest-column-a-wonderful-day-spent-in-grand-county-at-crooked-gravel/)

**[ELITE] — Aid station strategy:** Colonel "wolfed down a couple bananas, refilled my bottles with some Tailwind, stretched my back and was off" at Aid #1. Later: "Most skipped this aid [#3], but I needed some sustenance to make for a semi-enjoyable finish to the day." (https://www.exploringtherockies.com/2023/08/03/2023-crooked-gravel-race/)

**[ELITE] — Managing the Blue Ridge climb:** Ashley Darah: "There was this one truck that went up and down a couple times with some kids in it that kept cheering for us, which was honestly very sweet and the encouragement was highly appreciated." She also "befriended a mama goat and her babies on the road" suggesting the need for mental strategies during this long grind. (https://www.skyhinews.com/news/guest-column-a-wonderful-day-spent-in-grand-county-at-crooked-gravel/)

**[ELITE] — Pacing mistake:** Colonel notes staying on the bike continuously during the Blue Ridge climb "ultimately hurt me as my back, arms and ass really suffered" and suggests brief stops might be strategic. (https://www.exploringtherockies.com/2023/08/03/2023-crooked-gravel-race/)

**[ELITE] — Fly management:** Colonel's strategy during the Blue Ridge: "keeping a pace quick enough to keep the flies from overwhelming me" became a tactical consideration. (https://www.exploringtherockies.com/2023/08/03/2023-crooked-gravel-race/)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Mechanical risks:** The rough, washboard terrain causes significant equipment stress. Colonel noted "I have never seen so many people lose water bottles before by just getting too jostled around." (https://www.exploringtherockies.com/2023/08/03/2023-crooked-gravel-race/)

**Descending confidence:** The technical descents are a major separator. Colonel felt riders divide into "those who can handle the downhills and those who can't" and admitted he "fell somewhere in between." Elite riders "just went 'full send'" while more cautious riders pump brakes significantly. (https://www.exploringtherockies.com/2023/08/03/2023-crooked-gravel-race/)

**Mental challenge of Blue Ridge:** The 11-mile sustained climb at 5-10% grade in heat with biting flies is where Colonel nearly broke: "They almost broke me... I was in the 'pain cave' and just had to get through it." (https://www.exploringtherockies.com/2023/08/03/2023-crooked-gravel-race/)

**Cut-off time:** Official cut-off is 4:00 PM for the 67-mile course with an 8:00 AM start (8 hours total). (https://geminiadventures.com/bike/crooked-gravel)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Post-race scene:** "The end of the race was somewhat anti-climatic. The timed section was back somewhere along the Crooked Creek dirt road, so the remaining couple miles were along a bike path back in to town of Winter Park with no official welcoming committee. The line for beer and food was long, so I rode a little ways down the road to 'Big Trout Brewing' which was attached to the free parking garage I parked at where I met my brother who had been in the area hiking." [ELITE] (https://www.exploringtherockies.com/2023/08/03/2023-crooked-gravel-race/)

**Family-friendly vibe:** Ashley Darah: "it was so awesome to do it in my family's backyard... At the timing mat, I was greeted by a lot of volunteers cheering, which was so nice. These races always rely on having lots of volunteers, and they truly are a very important part of the race... I was surrounded by my family and I was just super happy." [ELITE] (https://www.skyhinews.com/news/guest-column-a-wonderful-day-spent-in-grand-county-at-crooked-gravel/)

**Finish line experience:** "From there it's a neutral cruise back into town / Hideaway Park via a bike path. Be sure to experience the fun of the Finish line arch (Start/Finish line) where you will get food, beer and we can be sure you have safely returned from your fun challenge." (https://geminiadventures.com/bike/crooked-gravel)

**Gravel community character:** Colonel notes: "Gravel races like these are just so much fun. Everyone is kind and is trying to have fun and turn themselves inside out." [ELITE] (https://www.skyhinews.com/news/guest-column-a-wonderful-day-spent-in-grand-county-at-crooked-gravel/)

**Weekend atmosphere:** The event includes shakeout rides, expo, yoga, sauna recovery, beer garden, live music, and awards ceremonies creating a full weekend experience beyond just the race. (https://geminiadventures.com/bike/crooked-gravel)

**Historical connection:** The race traces its roots to Ron Kiefel's "Crooked Roubaix" — "an audacious personal challenge undertaken by legendary pro cyclist Ron Kiefel in the early 2000s. Kiefel, a former Tour de France stage winner, rode approximately 95 miles—most of it unpaved—at high alpine elevations before gravel bikes were even a thing." (https://avidcyclist.com/featured-event/the-crooked-gravel-from-crooked-roubaix-to-colorado-cycling-classic/)

**Communication during neutral start [ELITE]:** "On the neutral start on road, everyone was very communicative which was helpful" regarding pothole navigation. (https://www.skyhinews.com/news/guest-column-a-wonderful-day-spent-in-grand-county-at-crooked-gravel/)
