# CRUSHER IN THE TUSHAR — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Zach Calton [ELITE]:** "We rolled up the pavement start easy. A one-man break (Rob Smallman) went up the road. Once we turn off the main highway and start the initial climb proper I went to the front and kept a hard tempo. I knew I was in good shape and had good preparation for this course and the altitude so I was confident I could put the hurt on and I was lucky to have great legs on the day. I looked back every few minutes and found a smaller and smaller group in tow... I hit it hard again and Torbjørn and Henry followed... Torbjørn and I had established a 10-15 second gap on Henry so I quickly filled a bottle and got out of there with a small gap on the other 2. Torbjørn bridged up on the road but I was able to get a gap about 1/4 up the Col. It slowly expanded to 2 minutes as we crested the Col de Crush and then I soloed from there maintaining that 2 minutes to the finish."

**Paige [ELITE]:** "I took a midseason break/down week the week before Crusher and just mentally unchecked. It was great, and I know it was needed to prioritize the goals I have for the second half of the season. With that, I have been known for my details and preparation leading into an event. These things take considerable time, but also a lot of mental energy so I actually opted not to do this prior to Crusher... I think this is important to share because it's really an unrealistic goal to bring the same level of preparation to ALL events." (https://www.paigepowered.com/post/crusher-in-the-tushar-race-recap-1)

**Paige [ELITE]:** "We were caught by the men's pack on the pavement section which is a false flat. As the women's field was swallowed by the men's field, I couldn't see where the women were at. I was frustrated and annoyed. But since I cared less about this event, I just decided not to force things and make a huge move to get closer to the front." (https://www.paigepowered.com/post/crusher-in-the-tushar-race-recap-1)

**Paige [ELITE]:** "Halfway up the first climb, I caught up with Sarah Sturm and we stayed together for most of the next 2 hours. We joked about how much more climbing we had left and tried to reassure each other that settling into our own pace was wise... I couldn't hold her wheel on the descent, but I was close (which I was so proud of!) and was able to catch back on by the end of the pavement descent." (https://www.paigepowered.com/post/crusher-in-the-tushar-race-recap-1)

**kdcallister [COMPETITIVE]:** "Great race! The event is well done and organized nicely. Feed zones are spaced well and have a ton of offerings for re-fueling. Be aware of the weather…I've had darn near 100* in the valleys with rain/snow mix up top. Make sure to pack warm clothes and check them in to be delivered at the finish. If you need them you will be grateful." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/crusher-in-the-tushar-2022/68292)

**kdcallister [COMPETITIVE]:** "The descent is fast and loose on the switchbacks. The race is not won going down so error on the cautious side. A lot of bottles get ejected on the descent so make sure you have good tight cages." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/crusher-in-the-tushar-2022/68292)

**whatsername [COMPETITIVE]:** "I'm in again for the third time. I've done it on a mtb and a gravel bike. Besides the decent, I think it's overall faster on a gravel bike so long as you have the gearing for the climb (and as the poster above mentioned, enough left in the legs to climb some more after the climb)." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/crusher-in-the-tushar-2022/68292)

**Burke Swindlehurst (Race Founder) [ELITE]:** "I just knew that as a rider myself, I was really craving something completely different than the run-of-the-mill events that I'd been participating in for 25+ years. And, I was eager to create something that was not only unique, but also approachable and fun for newcomers to the sport and folks like myself who have been racing bikes for a long time and were becoming a bit burned out on some of the less attractive aspects of road racing." (https://www.cxmagazine.com/interview-burke-swindlehurst-crusher-tushar-gravel-ride-race)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Gearing:**

**Paige [ELITE]:** "Gearing was made simple with the mullet set up, I ran a 46t front chain ring and a SRAM Eagle 10-50t rear cassette and felt this was perfect for the steep climbs, but also able to push power on the flat middle section" (https://www.paigepowered.com/post/crusher-in-the-tushar-race-recap-1)

**kdcallister [COMPETITIVE]:** "I used a 34-34 twice and last year 38-36 for my easiest gears. Most riders have the big pie plates in the rear, but I have been ok. It really depends on your climbing fitness. Nothing is crazy steep, it's just the duration. Having said that I just got the new Sram Force Xplr rear mech so I'll change things up this year from a 38 front 10-36 rear to a 42 front 10-44 rear." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/crusher-in-the-tushar-2022/68292)

**Burke Swindlehurst (Race Director) [ELITE]:** "In terms of gearing, my recommendation for the average rider is something close to a '1 to 1' low-end gear ratio to tackle the climbs. For instance, a 34-tooth front chainring with a 32 tooth cog in the rear." (https://www.cxmagazine.com/interview-burke-swindlehurst-crusher-tushar-gravel-ride-race)

**Tires:**

**Paige [ELITE]:** "HED Emporia GC3 pro wheels with WTB Vulpine 40's, running 29psi front and 31psi rear for pressure" (https://www.paigepowered.com/post/crusher-in-the-tushar-race-recap-1)

**Burke Swindlehurst (Race Director) [ELITE]:** "For tires, I recommend erring on the side of caution with the variability of conditions you can encounter. I like tires with robust sidewalls to prevent cuts and at least 35c in volume with a fairly aggressive tread pattern for some of the looser corners on the course and also for grip when pedaling up the steeper grades you'll encounter to help keep the rear wheel planted." (https://www.cxmagazine.com/interview-burke-swindlehurst-crusher-tushar-gravel-ride-race)

**Bikes:**

**Paige [ELITE]:** "Trek Checkpoint was a dream with the isospeed evening out that washboard descending" (https://www.paigepowered.com/post/crusher-in-the-tushar-race-recap-1)

**whatsername [COMPETITIVE]:** Notes having ridden on both MTB and gravel bike, recommending gravel bike if you have adequate gearing (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/crusher-in-the-tushar-2022/68292)

**Other Gear:**

**Paige [ELITE]:** "ABUS gamechanger 2.0…..yeah you read that right, new model to be available soon which includes more vents. I wouldn't normally opt for an aero helmet on a climbing race, but I wanted to test out the new vents and they were great!" (https://www.paigepowered.com/post/crusher-in-the-tushar-race-recap-1)

**kdcallister [COMPETITIVE]:** "A lot of bottles get ejected on the descent so make sure you have good tight cages." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/crusher-in-the-tushar-2022/68292)

**General Equipment Evolution:**

**Burke Swindlehurst (Race Director) [ELITE]:** "For the first three to four years you were seeing a pretty even distribution of cyclocross and mountain bikes along with quite a few 'Frankenbikes.' But in the last few years with the explosion of the 'gravel' segment, we're obviously seeing a lot more bikes that have been designed with specificity to this style of riding and racing. Coming to mind first would be bikes with more tire clearance than what a traditional cyclocross bike would have, allowing for tires up to 40c wide and beyond. Disc brakes, of course. I'm also starting to see tweaks in geometry like lower bottom brackets heights for stability at higher speeds and chainstays are getting shorter and shorter for a quicker feel out of the saddle when climbing." (https://www.cxmagazine.com/interview-burke-swindlehurst-crusher-tushar-gravel-ride-race)

## Weather Experienced

**kdcallister [COMPETITIVE] on weather variability:** "Be aware of the weather…I've had darn near 100* in the valleys with rain/snow mix up top. Make sure to pack warm clothes and check them in to be delivered at the finish." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/crusher-in-the-tushar-2022/68292)

**whatsername [COMPETITIVE]:** "It was really hot down in the valley last year and even tho there were aid stations, I saw a few riders run out of water between them (I had a camelback and bottle)." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/crusher-in-the-tushar-2022/68292)

**whatsername [COMPETITIVE]:** "Weather will always be interesting there, and can vary a lot on the course from chilly at start to hot in the valley. One year we had hailstones." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/crusher-in-the-tushar-2022/68292)

**2025 race conditions:** "Temperatures as high as 95 degrees on the eastern edge of the Great Basin Desert" (https://granfondodailynews.com/2025/07/16/crusher-tushar-results-calton-sturm-crush-utah-gravel-on-the-road-to-victory/)

**Paige [ELITE] on 2025:** "As we hit the notorious sandy and hot pit, I opted to up the pace slightly" (https://www.paigepowered.com/post/crusher-in-the-tushar-race-recap-1)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Burke Swindlehurst (Race Director) [ELITE]:** "You know, I think we really have the proverbial 'kitchen sink' when it comes to types of surfaces riders will encounter on the course. Everything from hard-pack dirt that's nearly as smooth as asphalt to intermittent stretches of golf-ball size rocks, to ball-bearing 'pea' gravel that makes it pretty much impossible to pedal out of the saddle on some of the steeper climbs. It's also not uncommon to encounter washboards in certain areas that are severe enough to rattle tooth fillings loose!" (https://www.cxmagazine.com/interview-burke-swindlehurst-crusher-tushar-gravel-ride-race)

**kdcallister [COMPETITIVE]:** "Try to get in a pace line after the gravel descent. It will help a ton through the paved area. The main climb gets all the press, but you have to climb to get to it and climb after it as well. There is a nice little steep section to the finish. Just enough to cook already cooked legs:)" (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/crusher-in-the-tushar-2022/68292)

**kdcallister [COMPETITIVE]:** "Nothing is crazy steep, it's just the duration." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/crusher-in-the-tushar-2022/68292)

**whatsername [COMPETITIVE]:** "There's a lot of 10-12% gradients but not much worse than that." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/crusher-in-the-tushar-2022/68292)

**Paige [ELITE]:** "As we hit the notorious sandy and hot pit, I opted to up the pace slightly and try to be at the front of the group we were with since I didn't want to get stuck behind any of the guys." (https://www.paigepowered.com/post/crusher-in-the-tushar-race-recap-1)

**Paige [ELITE]:** "We rolled with a fairly large group through the pavement flat loop, which I was thankful for given the headwinds. It took some effort to get people to echelon together, but eventually we were rolling." (https://www.paigepowered.com/post/crusher-in-the-tushar-race-recap-1)

**Paige [ELITE] on descending improvement:** "I made a 6 minute improvement on the descent time compared to last year's segment. I was really proud of that, a true testament to my improving skills and capacity to improve as my experience grows. I hired a MTB skills coach this winter, did drill/cone work to learn body positioning and relocated my life to more mountainous areas to actually have the chance to ride descents." (https://www.paigepowered.com/post/crusher-in-the-tushar-race-recap-1)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Paige [ELITE] on altitude pacing:** "I have very little experience at altitude, and my priority for this race was not to blow up and to pace well. On the first climb, I just settled into my own pace. I don't look at HR or power, so I gauge everything off what I would refer to as 'all day pace' and RPE feeling." (https://www.paigepowered.com/post/crusher-in-the-tushar-race-recap-1)

**Zach Calton [ELITE] on tactics:** "As the climb flattens out near the top, I was less keen to pull with the increased draft benefit and Jake and Torbjørn didn't seem anxious to either. Henry Nelson and Nathan Spratt ended up closing the gap as we crested the top before dropping down the Col de Crush. Henry and Torbjørn pushed the descent pretty hard and I followed. We dropped Jake and Nathan there. We rolled an easy tempo around to Circleville, as we got onto Sarlacc Pit Nathan bridged back up. Once on the Pit, I hit it hard again and Torbjørn and Henry followed. Nathan was undoubtedly tired from the time in the wind while we had a group of 3. We had agreed pre-race to stop at aid 4 after the Pit." (https://www.cyclingwest.com/racing/gravel-racing/sarah-sturm-and-zach-calton-top-2025-crusher-in-the-tushar-report-results-and-photos/)

**Paige [ELITE] on women's start timing issue:** "The women start first and historically, the men caught us when we are on the climb and it doesn't really impact the women's race. This year however, this was not the case. We need to have the women start AFTER the men. We were caught by the men's pack on the pavement section which is a false flat." (https://www.paigepowered.com/post/crusher-in-the-tushar-race-recap-1)

**Hydration Strategy - Paige [ELITE]:** "Last year, I did not carry a pack and stopped to refill 2 bottles in less than 30s on the last climb. I personally just did not want to carry a pack with the extra weight. When I did my math with the water weight and impact on climbing speed (thanks Best Bike Split), it was more advantageous to not carry the water... I opted for what would make me more comfortable, which was not wearing a pack... I was fine stopping and adding on 30s if needed, and based on the math I still think it was faster. I started with 2x24oz bottles and then was able to grab 2x16oz bottles along the way and drink those. I think I had 1 coke cup hand-up at the DNA aid station with the ice socks and let me tell you, talk about a pick me up!" (https://www.paigepowered.com/post/crusher-in-the-tushar-race-recap-1)

**Fueling - Paige [ELITE]:** "Skratch superfuel in the bottles and SIS gels, 110g of carb per hour consumed" (https://www.paigepowered.com/post/crusher-in-the-tushar-race-recap-1)

**Shifting Stats - Paige [ELITE]:** "I shifted 1,049 times during the 69 mile race" (https://www.paigepowered.com/post/crusher-in-the-tushar-race-recap-1)

**kdcallister [COMPETITIVE] on descending strategy:** "The descent is fast and loose on the switchbacks. The race is not won going down so error on the cautious side." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/crusher-in-the-tushar-2022/68292)

## DNF Risk Factors

**whatsername [COMPETITIVE] on hydration risk:** "It was really hot down in the valley last year and even tho there were aid stations, I saw a few riders run out of water between them" (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/crusher-in-the-tushar-2022/68292)

**kdcallister [COMPETITIVE] on bottle loss:** "A lot of bottles get ejected on the descent so make sure you have good tight cages." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/crusher-in-the-tushar-2022/68292)

**kdcallister [COMPETITIVE] on weather preparedness:** "I've had darn near 100* in the valleys with rain/snow mix up top. Make sure to pack warm clothes and check them in to be delivered at the finish. If you need them you will be grateful." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/crusher-in-the-tushar-2022/68292)

**Burke Swindlehurst (Race Director) [ELITE] on tire cuts:** "I like tires with robust sidewalls to prevent cuts" (https://www.cxmagazine.com/interview-burke-swindlehurst-crusher-tushar-gravel-ride-race)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**whatsername [COMPETITIVE]:** "It's a really cool event and the town of Beaver is really nice, the locals seem to like having the event there." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/crusher-in-the-tushar-2022/68292)

**kdcallister [COMPETITIVE]:** "Enjoy the day, take in the beauty, and good luck!" (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/crusher-in-the-tushar-2022/68292)

**Burke Swindlehurst (Race Founder) [ELITE]:** "The first couple of years there was a cap imposed on the event by a land agency, but now the cap is self-imposed in the interest of keeping it manageable on my end and also as an attempt to preserve a certain 'vibe' I think we've been able to create. There's a quote from an author I really enjoy who said 'growth for the sake of growth is the ideology of the cancer cell.' When I first read that quote it really resonated with me, and I find myself coming back to that idea as a barometer for a lot things in life, this event included." (https://www.cxmagazine.com/interview-burke-swindlehurst-crusher-tushar-gravel-ride-race)

**Amy Charity (SBT GRVL Director) [COMPETITIVE]:** "Most of us involved in gravel, whether as promoters or riders, came to gravel because of the absence of rules... We believe that a minimal set of rules is necessary, but it's up to the racers to determine their own so-called code of conduct." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/news/gravel/gravel-race-organizers-balk-at-the-request-for-more-rules/)

**Bobby Wintle (Mid South Founder) [COMPETITIVE]:** "I am staunchly opposed to putting things in place in my event that affects everyone but that only applies to one percent of the participants." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/news/gravel/gravel-race-organizers-balk-at-the-request-for-more-rules/)

**Amy Charity on mass start philosophy:** "It's one of the key distinguishing factors in gravel racing that separates it from other types of cycling events. We believe that one start line and one start time is refreshingly simple for the riders and allows them the opportunity to line up where they are comfortable." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/news/gravel/gravel-race-organizers-balk-at-the-request-for-more-rules/)

**Event size and growth:** "The 13th annual event, started by Utah legend Burke Swindlehurst and now promoted by Life Time, saw 800 participants from 33 states and 7 countries across the various fields." (https://www.cyclingwest.com/racing/gravel-racing/sarah-sturm-and-zach-calton-top-2025-crusher-in-the-tushar-report-results-and-photos/)

**Registration demand:** "We have 600 riders registered this year, which is the same cap we have had in-place now for four years, and though the race technically hasn't 'grown' for a while now, it continues to pick-up speed in terms of how quickly it fills to capacity. In 2015 the race hit its 600 rider limit in just under a week and this year it took less than 36 hours." (https://www.cxmagazine.com/interview-burke-swindlehurst-crusher-tushar-gravel-ride-race)
