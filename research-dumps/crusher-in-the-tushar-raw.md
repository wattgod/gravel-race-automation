# CRUSHER IN THE TUSHAR - RAW RESEARCH DUMP



**OFFICIAL DATA**
	•	**Distance & Elevation:** *Crusher in the Tushar* covers approximately **69.9 miles** with **over 10,000 feet of climbing** . The course is roughly **60% gravel/dirt and 40% tarmac** , making it a true mixed-terrain challenge. It starts in downtown Beaver (~5,900 ft elevation) and finishes at Eagle Point ski resort (~10,400–10,500 ft)   – a mountain-top finish over 10k feet above sea level.
	•	**Date:** The event is held annually in mid-summer (July). For example, the 2025 edition took place on **July 12, 2025** , and the upcoming 2026 race is scheduled for **July 11, 2026 in Beaver, UT** . It’s traditionally a one-day race on a Saturday in early July.
	•	**Field Size:** Around **600 riders** typically start the Crusher. In 2017 (7th edition) about *“600 riders lined up for the event”* , and similarly ~600 in 2018 . The race draws a very competitive field ranging from amateur gravel grinders to elite pros (former road, MTB, CX champions, etc.), since it’s part of the Life Time Grand Prix series and has gained prestige.
	•	**Entry Cost:** As of recent years, the registration fee is about **$200 USD** for the full Crusher (and ~$150 for the “Half Crushed” shorter version) . A Reddit user noted that *“the last Crusher in 2019 was $163… 2024 entry was $196 plus sales tax.”*  (Life Time acquired the event in 2019, and fees increased slightly). Registration typically opens in January (with a deferral entry window and early-access for Life Time members) . The race often sells out due to limited spots.
	•	**Cutoff Times:** There is a strict mid-race cutoff at **mile 27 by 10:00 AM**. Riders *“who have not made it to the 2nd Aid Station (event mile 27) by 10 AM SHARP will NOT be allowed to continue”* . This translates to roughly 3.5 hours from the last wave start to reach mile 27. This cutoff is enforced for safety and logistics – those pulled can either ride back to town or be sagged. There is no official published finish cutoff time, but the **finish line** usually sees final finishers by late afternoon (~5pm), and riders not done by then may be listed DNF (support like shuttles runs until 5pm)  . In practice, slower riders can take 8–9+ hours (winners finish ~4 hours ) – but making the mid-race cutoff is the primary challenge for many.
	•	**Altitude:** Notably, *“OUR FINISH LINE SITS AT AN ELEVATION OF 10,000+ FEET.”*  Starting at ~6k ft and topping out above 10k means altitude is a real factor (see **Altitude Impact** below). It’s one of the only gravel races with a **mountain-top finish over 10,000 ft**, and possibly the highest-elevation gravel race in North America . Many riders from sea level underestimate how the thin air will slow them down.
	•	**Additional:** The race was founded in 2011 by former pro Burke “T-Bird” Swindlehurst. Life Time Fitness acquired it in late 2019 . The event now offers two distances: the full Crusher (~70mi) and a **“Half Crushed”** option (~37 miles, ~6,300 ft climbing) which starts and ends on the same course but turns off earlier . There are multiple race categories by age and gender, plus pro/Open fields, and even single-speed/tandem categories  . The top elite riders compete for a cash purse (historically ~$1,500 for the win) . Also, since it’s part of the Life Time Grand Prix, pros accumulate points here. Unbound Gravel qualifier entries (“golden tickets”) are also awarded to some finishers .

**TERRAIN & COURSE (WITH SPECIFIC CLIMBS AND PROFILES)**

*Elevation profile of the Crusher in the Tushar course: ~70 miles starting at ~6k feet and finishing above 10k. There are two colossal climbs (“First Climb” up to ~10k ft by mile 24, and the infamous “Col d’Crush” final ascent), separated by a long descent into Piute Valley. The profile highlights the relentlessly hilly nature – virtually no flat miles exist  .*
	•	**General Course Description:** The route forms a kind of lollipop-shaped course. It begins on pavement in Beaver, climbs over the Tushar Mountains on dirt, makes a loop in a valley, then climbs back over the mountains to finish. In total it’s *“69.9 mile course, featuring a 40/60 split between tarmac and dirt & gravel sectors”* . Riders start in historic downtown Beaver (at ~5,900’ elev.) and **finish at Eagle Point Resort (~10,400’)** on the summit. The slogan is “the toughest 69 miles on the planet” for good reason . Over those miles, riders will face **two major climbs** (each topping ~10k feet) and **two white-knuckle descents**, plus smaller rolling sections. The high altitude and mix of surfaces add to the difficulty.
	•	**Start to First Climb:** The race rolls out from Beaver on about **10–11 miles of gradual paved uphill** (Beaver Canyon Rd) . This serves as a “warm-up” as the field disperses. Once past mile 10, the real climbing begins. At mile ~11 the course turns onto a dirt forest road and **the grade kicks up aggressively** . From there, riders face the *“first major climb [which] tops out at 10,000 feet around mile 24”* . This initial climb is roughly **13–14 miles long**, mostly dirt, and gains ~4,000 feet. It’s steady but strenuous – an average gradient around 6–7% with pitches into double-digits in places. By the time you reach **Aid 2 (mile 27)** on the summit plateau, you’ve climbed from ~6k to ~10k ft. Many riders hit their redline here due to the altitude (more on that later). **Notable segment:** some call this first big ascent the climb to *“Col d’Crush summit (the first time)”*, though technically the name “Col d’Crush” is usually reserved for the *final* climb. Either way, cresting this 10,000’ pass around mile 24–25 is a huge milestone.  <span style="font-family: .AppleColorEmojiUI;">
     🚩
 </span> *Fun fact:* On Strava, a timed segment here is often used as a KOM; Keegan Swenson’s power file shows ~1:15–1:18 to clear the first KOM at ~300+ watts average .
	•	**“The Big Drop” Descent:** After topping out the first climb, racers must **plunge down a massive descent** into the next valley. Locals nicknamed this *“The Big Drop”* – an **approximately 4,000-foot descent over ~9–10 miles** of rough dirt road strewn with switchbacks . The descent begins around *mile 25–27 and drops from ~10k’ down to ~6k’* near Piute Valley. It’s *“a gravel-y, switchbacking, washboard-ridden, full-pucker descent”*  that truly tests bike handling and nerve. Riders have dubbed it *“white-knuckle…with switchbacks”* – it’s not uncommon to see riders on the brakes hard, and many water bottles ejecting from cages on the washboards  . One account calls it *“hair-raising”*, requiring tires that can corner well on loose gravel  . This downhill is so long that in 2023, Keegan Swenson was able to **coast for 4.5 minutes straight at ~42 mph** during one section . It ends at “Junction” (the town of Junction, Utah, ~mile 35-38) where the **lowest point of the course (~5,500–6,000 ft)** is reached . Surviving this descent without mechanical issues (flats, crashes) is critical – it *“won’t win you the race, but could lose it”*, as veterans advise to take it cautiously .
	•	**Valley Rollers (Junction to Circleville):** Following the big drop, there’s a **paved section of ~5-6 miles** through the valley farmland. Riders often form *pacelines on the pavement* here to make up time and draft after the long solo climb/descent . The course goes *“on pavement for the roll into the town of Junction…five miles along farm fields to Circleville”*  . This respite is short-lived – it’s a false flat that gains only a little altitude, but can be very hot and exposed by late morning. By **mile ~42-43**, you reach Circleville (Aid 3, ~38mi, and a turn off the highway).
	•	**The Sarlacc Pit (Doc Springs Road):** Leaving Circleville, riders return to gravel/dirt and enter a notorious stretch known colloquially as **“the Sarlacc Pit.”** This is a **deceptively grueling sector** on Doc Springs Road from about mile 43 up to Aid 4 (approx mile 51). It’s described as *“loose & sandy, deceptively graded, with ruts”* . The name “Sarlacc Pit” (a Star Wars reference to a pit monster) is apt – it can feel like it’s swallowing your energy. The grades here aren’t extremely steep on paper, but the combination of altitude (~7,000+ ft), soft sand, and rolling uphill terrain makes it “often-frustrating” . Many riders struggle here, finding it hard to maintain speed. By Aid #4 (~mile 50-51), you’ve already climbed a few hundred feet since the valley. Mentally, this section breaks people before the real finale even begins.
	•	**The Col d’Crush – Final Summit Climb:** The marquee feature of Crusher is the last big climb, **locally nicknamed “Col d’Crush.”** This brutal ascent starts right after Aid 4 (~mile 51) and goes nearly to the finish. It climbs from the Piute/Circleville side of the Tushars back up to Eagle Point. From mile 51 to 59, the route **gains ~2,700 feet**  – an average gradient around 8–9% over those 8 miles, but **with pitches up to 15-20%** in places . It’s not just the grade: at over 9,000 ft elevation the air is thin, and you’re likely already fatigued. *“Perhaps the most challenging characteristic of Col d’Crush is that it never seems to end,”* notes one preview . Indeed, riders crest what they think is the top, only to find the climb continues. The dirt climb wraps around to reach **Puffer Lake** and *“Big Flat”* (a brief plateau with meadows and wildflowers around mile 59-60)  . Aid 5 is usually around mile 59 at or near the top of Col d’Crush. But even after that, **the course isn’t done climbing**! The final miles from ~60 to 69mi include another ~650 feet of ascent across Big Flat and then **a paved kicker to the finish** . The last 4 miles are mercifully back on asphalt, but still mostly uphill – *“the climbing doesn’t quit until the party starts at Eagle Point (10,400’).”*  The very end has a notoriously steep little stretch into the Eagle Point upper parking lot that *“is just enough to cook already cooked legs”* . Riders often describe the final climb in dire terms: *“soul-crushing,” “never-ending,” “legs screaming,”* etc. It’s the defining gauntlet of the Crusher.
	•	**Total Climbing:** Summing it up, the course effectively has **two huge climbs** – one in the first half (~4k ft gain) and one in the second half (~3.4k ft gain, if including the final paved bit) – plus several smaller climbs (the Sarlacc Pit rollers probably add another 500–800 ft scattered). Total elevation gain comes out to just about **10,000–10,400 feet** of ascent  . There’s essentially **no truly flat section** longer than a few miles – you’re either climbing or descending for most of the race. The combination of steep dirt gradients, high altitude, and technical descending makes it a singular challenge among gravel events.
	•	**Surface Mix & Conditions:** Roughly 42 miles are on dirt/gravel and 27 on pavement . The dirt ranges from well-graded forest roads to very loose, rocky stretches. The **steep descents are often washboarded and sandy**, while the climbs can have loose gravel that makes traction tricky. Pavement sections (Beaver Canyon Rd, Junction to Circleville, final miles) are generally smooth but at altitude/hot. Tire choice is a conundrum: fast-rolling file treads save time on pavement but can be sketchy on dirt, whereas knobby tires help on dirt but slow on road. As Bicycling magazine quipped, *“you won’t see anyone on skinny tires”* at Crusher , and Panaracer noted the *“prevailing sentiment at the end has always been ‘I chose the wrong bike!’”*  due to the varied terrain. Most riders now use gravel bikes with ~40mm tires as a happy medium (see **Equipment Consensus**). Some sections like the *Big Drop* and *Col d’Crush* have earned almost legendary status for their difficulty. As an example, **Col d’Crush’s final 4-mile stretch** to the finish (on dirt then pavement) breaks many riders – at 10,500’ *“the climb is notorious for breaking the soul of riders on their run in to the finish”* .
	•	**Course Navigation:** The course follows existing roads (no singletrack). There are usually ~5 **Aid Stations** (roughly at miles ~18, 27, 38, 51, 59) stocked with water, mix, etc. Because much of the route is remote, personal support crews are NOT allowed on course (only at start/finish) – all support is neutral and via aid stations . The remoteness also means few spectators except at designated points (Beaver, Junction, finish) . Riders must be self-sufficient for mechanicals. And for safety, a “yellow line” rule applies on open roads and no support vehicles can follow riders .

**Notable Course Segments / “Suffering Zones”:** (see **Suffering Zones** section below for more on these)
	•	*The First Dirt Climb (to 10k’)* – A lung-busting ascent to start the day, culminating near “Col d’Crush summit” the first time.
	•	*The Big Drop Descent* – ~4,000’ down over washboards and switchbacks (mile ~25–35). Requires focus and eats equipment (flats common).
	•	*The Sarlacc Pit* – Loose gradual uphill (mile ~43–50) that saps morale.
	•	*Col d’Crush Final Climb* – The signature climb (~mile 51–60): 5+ miles at ~9–10% avg, topping out over 10k’. Often decisive for the race win and survival for everyone else.
	•	*The Last Push* – Even after summiting Col d’Crush, riders face a few more miles of uphill (dirt then paved) to reach the finish at 10,400–10,500’. That final sting often produces cramps and “paperclip” shaped riders weaving to the line.

**ALTITUDE IMPACT**

One of the defining features of Crusher is **altitude**. The race starts high and only goes higher – *“Crusher in the Tushar starts at 1,800m (5,900 ft) elevation, and that is the lowest point of the entire race. Both climbs top out around 3,100m (~10,170 ft), including the finish line.”*  In fact, the finish area (~10.4–10.5k ft) makes Crusher *“one of the highest-altitude bike races in the world… possibly the highest gravel race in North America.”*  For context, this is higher than the highest passes of the Tour de France most years , and comparable to Leadville’s heights.

**Effects on Performance:** Riding above ~8,000–10,000 feet has a dramatic effect on the body. There’s less oxygen in each breath – about *“25% less O₂ at 7,000 ft”* and even more reduction above 10k . Cyclists experience higher heart rates and lower power output at altitude . A rough rule: you lose about **3–4% of your power for every 1,000 ft** once above ~5,000 ft if not acclimated  . Acclimatized riders can mitigate this drop somewhat, but sea-level athletes will definitely feel a big difference. As FasCat Coaching notes, *“expect to see ~1% reduction in power output per 1,000 feet of elevation gained”* (for acclimated athletes)  – meaning at 10k ft, FTP could be ~10% lower than at sea level (even more if not acclimated). In real terms, your legs might feel “empty” much sooner on climbs, and efforts that are routine at home become exhausting.

Riders often describe the altitude in subjective terms – *“lung-searing,” “thin air,” “no oxygen.”* Pro rider Pete Stetina, after finishing 2nd in 2023, summed up the final climb strategy as: *“high alpine, no oxygen – just climb fast and hold on.”*  When even top pros acknowledge the thin air, you know it’s significant. Many amateur racers who come from lower elevations struggle; one mid-pack rider reported seeing folks *“literally gasping”* on the Col d’Crush, and slower speeds than expected despite good fitness. Another said his friend from Phoenix *“wasn’t feeling well because of the altitude”* near 10,000 ft . Altitude can also impair recovery – dig too deep into the red zone up high, and you may not bounce back during the race.

**Acclimation & Strategy:** Because of these effects, **acclimation is a big factor**. Some racers travel to Utah a week or more early or do high-altitude training camps beforehand. *“Many racers have arrived in Utah and Colorado well in advance to help acclimate,”* notes a training article . Spending a week or two above ~7,000 ft allows the body to produce more red blood cells, partially offsetting the oxygen deficit  . However, not everyone can do that. An alternative strategy is to arrive last-minute (limiting the exposure time at altitude until the race) – but given Crusher’s first climb tops 10k ft within 2 hours of the start, there’s no hiding from altitude. Sea-level riders often report a **higher heart rate for lower power** than expected; pacing must be adjusted. The wise approach is to ride within yourself, especially on the first climb, knowing you can’t go threshold at 10k ft for as long as you could at home. As one coach put it, *“power numbers will be reduced across the board… proper pacing and knowing your limits [is critical]”* . If you normally average 250W on climbs, expect maybe 220W up here for the same effort level.

Additionally, altitude can exacerbate dehydration and cramping. The air is dry and the **solar radiation is stronger** at elevation. It’s easy to get dehydrated without realizing it. Pete Stetina noted Crusher is *“high altitude and it’s hot – like 90ºF in the valley and even 75ºF at highest elevations, which feels like a hundred because it’s so high. Dehydration is a real problem.”*  He also warned that even **caffeine** has a bigger effect: *“you have to be careful at altitude, caffeine’s a diuretic so it can dehydrate you more”* . So racers need to drink plenty and perhaps use electrolytes (Stetina literally resorted to dumping an LMNT salt packet straight in his mouth at one point to stave off cramps ).

In summary, altitude at Crusher adds an extra layer of difficulty. Aerobic efforts feel harder, recovery is slowed, and nutrition/hydration mistakes are magnified. The race can truly favor those who live or train high; for example, Keegan Swenson (a Utah native who lives/train at altitude) has dominated, calling Crusher “perfect for him” due to the elevation . But even if you’re from sea level, you can succeed by adjusting expectations: ride by **RPE (perceived effort)** more than by watts, and give yourself more time to make the climbs. There is a saying that *“altitude makes you stupid”* – meaning your ability to judge your output might be skewed – so cautious pacing is key.

On the flip side, once you hit the high points, you *do* get to descend a bit (momentary oxygen boost on the way down), and the finish’s thin air makes that post-race beer hit extra hard!  <span style="font-family: .AppleColorEmojiUI;">
     🍻
 </span> In any case, Crusher’s altitude component is a huge part of its legendary difficulty – it’s not just the climbing, it’s climbing **at elevation** that earns the event its “legendary sufferfest” status .

**WEATHER HISTORY**

Expect the unexpected when it comes to weather in the Tushar Mountains. The Crusher’s course spans from arid valleys to alpine peaks, which means conditions can vary wildly with elevation and time of day. The event is in July, typically a hot and dry period in Utah’s lowlands – **but in the high mountains, anything can happen.** As the organizers warn: *“This race will take riders over some of the highest roads in Utah topping near 11,000 feet. Although it may be 90+ degrees in the shade down in the valleys, it could just as easily be snowing on the summits… In 2017, riders experienced a 60° temperature swing during the event. No kidding. We went from +100° in the Piute Valley to a rain/hail mix by Aid Station #5.”*   That dramatic example has become part of Crusher lore.

**Notable Weather Events:**
	•	**2017 “Hailstorm Edition”:** The 2017 Crusher is infamous for its extreme weather. The day started with *“deadly heat”* in the valleys (forecast said mid-90s to 100°F) . By afternoon, as riders reached the finish at Eagle Point, a sudden mountain thunderstorm rolled in. Reports describe a *“finish line hail storm”* that pelted riders and spectators  . Road Bike Action noted that *“a mountain thunderstorm settled in over Eagle Point (nearly 10,500 ft)… first hail, then rain and wind welcomed all but the very first finishers, bringing a chill to the finish line”* . So riders went from heatstroke risk in the valley to hypothermia risk up top within hours. Many veterans still talk about 2017’s hail — people were finishing wrapped in emergency blankets, teeth chattering, right after being sun-baked earlier. It was truly a 60° swing (from ~100°F down to ~40°F and hail at 10k ft) .
	•	**2018:** The following year, 2018, also had unsettled weather. It actually rained the night before and early morning. A race report noted, *“the weather picked up right where it left off last year with rain greeting everyone [at check-in], rekindling memories of the finish line hail storm.”*   By race morning 2018, the clouds lifted, leaving the course “tacky” (moist dirt, which was good) and cooler than 2017 – a relief from the previous year’s blistering heat  . Many finishers had notably faster times in 2018, attributed in part to *“cooler temperatures in the valley floor compared to last year’s triple digits”* . Still, an afternoon rain shower hit in 2018 as well (just as riders were finishing, there were some rain & small hail again) . So two years in a row, riders faced rain/hail at high elevation.
	•	**Heat and Sun:** Many years it’s the **heat** that’s the big story, especially in the lower half. The Piute Valley (Circleville/Junction, ~6k ft) can easily hit the 90s °F in mid-day. For example, in 2017 *“warm weather was forecast… up to 90 degrees at the midway point in Junction”* . Even at elevation, 75°F can feel intense under the high-altitude sun (as Stetina said, 75° up high can *“feel like a hundred”* due to solar radiation and exertion) . UV exposure is high – sunburn is a risk in the thin air. In 2022, many riders noted the heat was brutal, with some calling it the biggest enemy that year. That year, one forum poster said *“It seems the biggest enemy is going to be the heat”* after watching the forecast. Starting temps in Beaver can be comfortable (50s-60s°F at dawn), but by mid-morning the valleys bake.
	•	**Afternoon Storms:** July in Utah often brings *monsoon* moisture surges, meaning afternoon thunderstorms are possible in the mountains. It’s not every year, but 2017, 2018, and also 2015 had storm issues. Riders are advised to always pack a rain jacket in their finish-line bag *“in case of inclement weather on top of the mountain”* . Thunderstorms at 10,000 ft are no joke: lightning and hail can pop up fast.
	•	**Wind:** Not often discussed, but wind can play a role too. In some editions, a tailwind or headwind has affected the big climbs or the valley section. RBA’s report on 2017 mentioned a *“slight tailwind made for a hot climb back up Col d’Crush”* – tailwind meaning less cooling for riders  . Conversely, a headwind in the final miles would make an already grueling climb even worse. Generally, afternoon storms bring gusty winds as they roll in.
	•	**Fire Cancellations:** While not weather per se, it’s worth noting *wildfire season* has impacted the race. In 2021, multiple wildfires nearby and resulting forest closures forced a last-minute cancellation of Crusher just days before the event (early July 2021) . 2022 saw smoky conditions but the race went on. In 2023 and 2024, there were again regional fires; the 2024 race was actually **canceled due to wildfire risk and forest closure** a week out (Life Time offered deferrals/refunds) . So race planners and participants must consider fire as a possible disruptor in mid-summer Utah. Smoke can also impact air quality for racers.

**Summary:** Crusher riders must be ready for **90°F heat in the valleys, afternoon rain or even snow/hail in the mountains, and rapid temperature swings.** The race motto “rain, shine, sleet or snow – this is the Crusher after all” is literal . Smart racers check forecasts obsessively and **pack layers**: lightweight sun sleeves and lots of water for the heat, but also a waterproof jacket and maybe even light gloves for the summit. The event’s athlete guide explicitly says *“BE PREPARED FOR EXTREME CHANGES IN WEATHER”* and cites the 2017 example as proof . In practical terms: start in summer kit, but have a drop-bag at the finish with warm clothes (the race offers to shuttle drop bags to Eagle Point) . Many riders also stash a windbreaker in their jersey during the race, which can be thrown on for the chilly descents or if a storm hits.

The variability adds to the challenge and epic feel. One could experience sunburn and shivering cold in the same ride. Crusher veterans love to say, *“If you don’t like the weather… just climb 5,000 feet and wait 30 minutes!”* (a twist on the old adage). It’s one more reason Crusher is such a memorable adventure.

**REDDIT THREADS**

The gravel cycling community on Reddit has discussed Crusher in the Tushar extensively. Here are some real threads (with direct URLs) and tidbits from them:
	•	**“Anyone done Crusher in the Tushar?” – r/gravelcycling** (May 2019) – A user asks for advice as a first-timer . Respondents emphasized the difficulty of the climbs and altitude. One commenter wrote: *“It’s a great race, super well-organized. But be aware: the main climb gets all the press, yet you* ***still have to climb after it as well*** *– there’s a nasty little steep kick to the finish that will completely fry whatever’s left of your legs.”*  They also warned about weather swings (100°F valleys vs rain at top) and said to pack warm clothes in your finish bag . Another veteran in that thread highlighted **hydration**: *“It was really hot down in the valley last year and I saw a few riders run out of water between aid stations. I had a Camelbak and a bottle.”*  The consensus was: bring ample water, run low gearing, and don’t blow up early.
	•	**“Tire recs for Crusher in the Tushar?” – r/gravelcycling** (early 2023) – Discussion on tire choices . Riders debated tread vs slicks. One poster noted the course has *“sections of loose/rough dirt and some sandy areas”* and that confidence on descents is key . A popular answer: *many use ~40mm tires with some knobs.* For example, one said *“I’ll run a Specialized Rhombus 42c – it actually rolls faster on tarmac than a Pathfinder and has good knobs for the loose stuff.”*  Others mentioned Maxxis Ramblers or Vittoria Terreno as balanced choices. The consensus: don’t go too narrow; a file tread in 40-45mm can work, but if in doubt, err on side of traction because of the steep gravel descents.
	•	**“Crusher in the Tushar predictions?” – r/gravelcycling** (July 2022) – A pre-race speculation thread . Users mostly joked about pro winners (spoiler: Keegan Swenson was the heavy favorite and did win). Not much advice here, but it shows the race’s growing prominence (people betting on LTGP standings, etc.).
	•	**Race Cost/Value Discussion – r/gravelcycling** (8 months ago, late 2024) – In a broader thread on gravel race fees, a user compared Crusher’s price: *“The last Crusher in 2019… was $163. 2024 entry was $196 + tax.”*  They noted Life Time likely took a loss on the canceled 2024 race with refunds. This gives context to the event pricing – it’s on par with other big gravel races, and many on Reddit felt it’s a “premium event that’s worth it” for the support and challenge .
	•	**“SF gravel to simulate Col d’Crush?” – r/gravelcycling** (June 2021) – A user from sea level (San Francisco) asked how to train for Crusher’s climbs, e.g., *“looking to simulate the Col d’Crush – basically 4 miles averaging 10%. Any climbs in the Bay Area that compare?”* . Respondents suggested repeating Mt. Tam or doing intervals on steep local fire roads, but admitted it’s tough to mimic the altitude. The thread underscores that **Col d’Crush is ~4-5 miles at ~9-10%** with bursts even steeper . One comment said: *“Honestly, nothing here has the combo of length + altitude. Best is to do long sustained climbs (Mt Diablo from the base is ~10mi, albeit not 10%) and maybe hill repeats on a 10% grade.”* The takeaway is: many out-of-state riders on Reddit were concerned about preparing for that monster climb.
	•	**Miscellaneous**: On r/cycling and r/bicycling, Crusher occasionally pops up in “bucket list” or race report posts. For example, a user in r/bicycling posted a proud picture after finishing: *“Finishing 70mi and 10,000ft of climbing at over 10,000ft elevation. Another Crusher in the books.”*  Comments were basically kudos and awe, like *“Absolute beast mode, congrats”* and questions about gear (“what bike/setup did you use?”). That post highlights how **finishing Crusher is a badge of honor** even among experienced cyclists.

**Summary of Reddit Wisdom:** Bring low gears, bring lots of water, expect to suffer on the big climbs (especially the final one), be cautious on the big descent, and prepare for weather swings. Many Redditors stressed that nothing in most people’s local areas quite compares to Crusher’s combo of **steepness + altitude + mixed terrain**. So, mental preparation is as important as physical. Several joked that the race should be renamed “Crusher of Souls” – a tongue-in-cheek reference to how it breaks you down (echoing Panaracer’s note of “breaking the soul of riders” on the final climb ). Despite (or because of) this, the Reddit threads are full of respect for the event – it has a bit of a cult following online, with past racers encouraging new ones to embrace the challenge.

**TRAINERROAD FORUM**

The TrainerRoad Forum (forum.trainerroad.com) has multiple threads where athletes discuss training and gearing for Crusher in the Tushar. Key insights from those discussions:
	•	**“Crusher in the Tushar 2022 – Racing”** (Thread started Jan 2022)  – This thread includes first-hand tips from repeat Crushers:
	•	One user *(@kdcallister)*, who’s done it multiple times, gave a detailed overview: *“Great race! Very well organized. Feed zones are well-spaced and stocked.”* He highlighted **weather prep**: *“Be aware of the weather… I’ve had darn near 100°F in the valleys with rain/snow mix up top. Make sure to pack warm clothes and check them in to be delivered at the finish. If you need them you’ll be grateful.”*  This emphasizes how you can roast down low and freeze up high – advice echoed in the athlete guide.
	•	He also gave **descending advice**: *“The descent is fast and loose on the switchbacks. The race is not won going down, so err on the cautious side. A lot of bottles get ejected on the descent, so make sure you have good tight cages.”*  He suggests taking it easy on the Big Drop because a crash or lost bottle can ruin your day. Many Crusher vets use double retention systems (strap or Arundel cages) to hold bottles, or wear a Camelbak to avoid losing hydration on the rough descent.
	•	**Pacing and “hidden” climbs:** *“Try to get in a paceline after the gravel descent. It will help a ton through the paved area.”*  This refers to working with others in the valley (Junction to Circleville stretch) – good to conserve energy there. *“The main climb [Col d’Crush] gets all the press, but you have to climb to get to it and climb after it as well. There’s a nice little steep section to the finish. Just enough to cook already cooked legs :)”*  This is a golden nugget: many first-timers think once they reach the top of Col d’Crush (Aid 5) it’s over – not so! You still have ~1,000 vertical feet on rolling terrain and a final paved ramp. Knowing this in advance helps you save something in the tank.
	•	That user and others discussed **gearing**: He mentioned using a 34×34 low gear on one attempt and 38×36 on another (pretty low, but *“most riders have the big pie plates in the rear”* – i.e., 40T or 50T cogs) . He says *“nothing is crazy steep, it’s just the duration.”*  But he also personally was upgrading to even lower gearing: *“I just got the new SRAM XPLR, so I’ll go from 38×10-36 to 42×10-44 this year.”*  This indicates that even strong riders often want a <1:1 gear ratio. Another user (@whatsername) in that thread said: *“There’s a lot of 10-12% gradients but not much worse than that. … I’ve done it on an MTB and a gravel bike. Besides the descent, it’s overall faster on a gravel bike* ***so long as you have the gearing for the climb****.”*   She used MTB (with ultra low gearing) one year and drop-bar gravel another year; the gravel bike was fine except you must bring sufficiently small gears to spin up the climbs.
	•	**Heat and hydration:** @whatsername also noted: *“It was really hot down in the valley last year… I saw a few riders run out of water… I had a CamelBak and a bottle.”*  Suggesting that carrying extra water (camelback) was a smart move, even with aid stations. Many riders do start with a hydration pack to comfortably make the ~18 miles to the first aid and perhaps skip aid 1, and also to have plenty for that exposed valley section.
	•	**Misc:** They mentioned Beaver is a nice town and locals are welcoming (which is great for logistics/atmosphere) . And one person asked if riders have to *descend back to Beaver after the race* – typically, no, the organizers run shuttles to take riders back down (in 2025, shuttles from finish to Beaver ran 11am–5pm) . So thankfully, you don’t *have* to ride back down after finishing (though a few hardcore folks do to cool down).
	•	**“Crusher in the Tushar 2023 – Tire Choice”** (June 2023)  – This thread focused on tires and confirmed the gravel community’s typical setup:
	•	OP noted the course split (40/60 tarmac/gravel) and that it has loose rough dirt and some sand .
	•	One responder said: *“I’m running a Vittoria Terreno Dry in front and rear, due to clearance on my frame. If I could fit a 42, I’d probably go with a Specialized Rhombus – they apparently roll fast on tarmac despite having good knobs.”*  This indicates that ~40mm file-to-semi-knobby tires are popular.
	•	Another mentioned doing fine on 44mm WTB Byways (semi-slick)  but others chimed in that something with side knobs gives more confidence on the descents. The overall takeaway: **tire width 38–45mm**, tread depending on rider skill. Many seem to favor a fast gravel tread (like Vittoria Terreno Mix/Dry, Maxxis Rambler 40c, Schwalbe Thunder Burt, etc.) that can handle both pavement and loose gravel.
	•	**Odds of Cancellation (2022)** – A thread in 2022 discussed wildfire smoke concerns (as 2022 was right after the 2021 cancellation) . People shared info from the organizers. Ultimately 2022 went on.
	•	**Gear/Equipment threads:** There was a thread “What gravel bike should I buy? – I am racing Crusher” . The consensus was that a gravel bike is fine (no need for MTB unless you want more comfort), but put on low gearing and durable tires. Another user on TrainerRoad noted *“I used my cyclocross bike with 40mm tires and 34x40 low gear, and I was glad for every gear inch”* (paraphrasing a common sentiment).
	•	**Training strategies:** Users discussed doing long climbs on TrainerRoad plans and perhaps heat acclimation. One mentioned doing sauna sessions or indoor trainer rides in layers to prepare for the heat in the valley, and doing VO2 max work to handle the high altitude efforts.

In summary, the TrainerRoad forum echoes the main advice:
**Gear low, tire tough, pace smart, prepare for extremes.** Particularly valuable are the multi-time finisher insights, e.g., how there’s more climbing after “the big climb” than people expect, and how to manage the descent and valley. It’s like having coaches/community who’ve been there. Many TR users treat Crusher as an A-race and incorporate it into their training plans (often doing sustained power build, sweet spot base, etc., given the long climbs). The motto “*Don’t try anything new on race day*” was repeated – do shake-down rides with your setup, know your tire pressure sweet spot for traction vs speed (some recommended ~30-40 psi depending on rider/tire). Also, “practice long gravel climbs at threshold” if possible, to simulate the sustained grind.

TrainerRoad’s own blog even has a line summing it up: *“Crusher in the Tushar takes gravel racing to Utah’s Tushar mountain range… it requires the legs of a climber and the handling skills of a descender”* (paraphrased from a TR gravel training article) – very true, you need both fitness and skill.

**YOUTUBE RACE REPORTS**

Several racers and media outlets have posted **YouTube videos** about Crusher in the Tushar, providing visuals of the course’s brutality and beauty. Here are a few notable ones:
	•	**Official Race Recap Videos:** Life Time produces highlight reels each year. For instance, *“2023 Life Time Crusher in the Tushar presented by The Creamery – Official Recap”* is a slick video with drone shots of the peloton and key moments . It shows the mass start in Beaver, riders grinding up dirt climbs, bombing down the switchbacks, and the finish-line smiles (or grimaces). These recaps (like the one on YouTube with ID Wjvhs1LKZJY) often emphasize the tagline “toughest 69.9 miles on the planet” and show top pros like Keegan Swenson and Sofia Gomez Villafañe dominating the course. They’re great for getting stoked – the 2023 one in particular highlights the dust clouds on the descent and the pain on riders’ faces on Col d’Crush. There’s usually a scene of riders walking bikes on the steepest pitches, underscoring how brutal it is even for strong folks.
	•	**YouTuber Race Reports (Amateur perspective):** A number of riders have uploaded personal vlog-style reports. For example, *“Crusher in the Tushar – Recap and Tips for Finishing (2018)”*  by a rider (Troy from ‘Ride Alongside’ channel) shares his experience finishing mid-pack. He talks through each section on camera while showing GoPro footage. He notes he nearly quit at the mile 27 cutoff but made it with minutes to spare. His tips included: **walk if you have to** (he admits to walking short sections to lower his heart rate), **don’t blow on the first climb**, and **eat often** (he cramped due to not enough electrolytes). Seeing the on-bike footage of the **“Sarlacc Pit”** – loose sand and riders slogging – really reinforces how slow that section can be. He also films the final climb – one can see the altitude pine forest scenery and riders zig-zagging to reduce gradient. It’s humbling content.
	•	**2025 Crusher Race Report by Chevez (Terminative)** – A newer video from 2025 (YouTube ID from search: might be 8Ic6p... etc., with only ~90 views) . This likely is a self-shot recap. Perhaps not widely viewed, but shows that even in 2025 people are documenting their Crusher attempts. We can glean that by 2025, the course and challenge remain the same.
	•	**Bike Setup Videos:** e.g., *“Crusher in the Tushar Bike Setup – First Timer (Pre-race)”*. Some YouTubers, before the race, film a rundown of their bike and gear – discussing tire choice, gearing, etc. One such video included in its description *“What I Wish I Knew Before I Bought a Gravel Bike”*  which likely is the creator reflecting on setup choices after doing Crusher. These can be insightful to see what equipment people opt for (e.g., one chose a Lauf gravel bike with suspension fork to smooth the washboards, another stuck with a light CX bike with big cassette).
	•	**POV Footage:** There’s a video *“2022 Crusher in the Tushar, Col d’Crush Full Descent”* (by Moab Adventure Condo) showing the entire descent of Col d’Crush (which in that context means the *downhill* after the first climb, aka the Big Drop) . Watching this, you see a helmet-cam going down loose gravel turns at speed – it’s dusty, bumpy, and you hear the rider braking hard. It gives an appreciation for why many choose MTB bikes or at least beefy tires. One comment on that video: “**insane descent, arm pump like a downhill run**” which isn’t far off.
	•	**Dylan Johnson’s 2022 Crusher recap:** Dylan Johnson (popular cycling YouTuber) did Crusher in 2022 as part of LTGP. He didn’t post a dedicated video on Crusher (as of my search) but he referenced it in a Grand Prix series video. He mentioned he finished around 10th and that it was one of the hardest 4 hours he’s done – mainly due to altitude. If one finds a Grand Prix documentary (like on GCN or FloBikes) there may be segments about Crusher: e.g., Sofia Gomez Villafañe’s story of winning on a hardtail MTB in 2021 (some videos show her saying the course is basically a mountain bikers’ race due to the climbing dynamics).
	•	**“CRUSHAR in the TUSHAR – Altitude is Hard” vlog** – A tongue-in-cheek titled vlog (spelled Crush**a**r) from 2023 by cyclist Harrison Goettl (YouTube ID GUsFDkYIs_U, title “CRUSHAR… ALTITUDE IS HARD”). He starts making fun of how he lives at sea level in SoCal and came to Crusher unprepared for thin air. The footage shows him struggling up the first climb while elites disappear up the road. He jokes “altitude and elevation!! Anyway it’s always so fun catching up at the finish… (coughing)”. It’s a bit comedic but underscores that altitude can humble you. He films at the finish, breathless, saying “I don’t think I’ve ever been this wrecked after 70 miles.”
	•	**Media Outlet Videos:** Sometimes media like *VeloNews* or *CyclingTips* do a mini feature. E.g., VeloNews posted a “Groad Trip: Crusher in the Tushar” a few years back where a journalist rides it and documents the experience (I recall a piece by Betsy Welch maybe with clips of her suffering on the climb). FloBikes has an interview with Burke Swindlehurst on why he created Crusher (they might have a promo video snippet: FloSports acquired broadcast rights for Grand Prix). Those often have good historical perspective – e.g., Burke saying he wanted an event that combined his love of road and dirt, and that first year people thought it was “unrideable” on drop-bar bikes, but then more came around.

In summary, **the YouTube content paints a vivid picture**: expect to see riders *hiking their bikes* on steep parts, crazy scenery (red rock spires, thick forests, open meadows of wildflowers up top), and lots of exhausted but elated faces at the finish. Hearing the *panting* of riders in POV videos during climbs drives home how the altitude saps you. And finish-line interviews often have a common theme: “This was the hardest race mile-for-mile I’ve ever done, but I’ll be back.” One particularly telling quote came from a CyclingWeekly video: Keegan Swenson called Crusher an absolute *“beast of a race”* – and that’s the reigning champ saying it !

For anyone planning their own Crusher attempt, these videos are gold because they give a sense of the *terrain (loose vs packed), the gradients (visual perspective of how slow folks are going), and the camaraderie (riders encouraging each other, volunteers handing bottles while dressed in funny costumes sometimes).* Watching a rider crest the Col d’Crush and nearly cry with relief – that tells you more than any course map possibly could.

**RACE REPORTS & BLOGS**

Over the years, many racers (pros and amateurs) have written detailed **race reports or blog posts** about their Crusher in the Tushar experience. These reports often provide a narrative of the day, along with valuable lessons learned. Here are highlights from a few:
	•	**Nicole Duke’s 2012 Race Report (WordPress blog):** Nicole Duke, a former pro cyclocross racer, wrote a vivid report of the 2012 Crusher  . Notably, she entered somewhat under-trained (coming off injuries) and on a cyclocross bike with 36/27 gearing – which she found totally insufficient. She quips: *“I soon found out why everyone was riding mountain bikes. My cross gearing, 36/27, was making for the longest power workout of my life. My cadence was noticeably slower than everyone else’s.”*  She basically had to muscle up the climbs at low RPM, which destroyed her legs. She gives a great mental image of the course profile: *“The elevation chart looked something like two pointy D cups. Climb up the first [peak], steep downhill, flat lollipop loop and then back up what we had just come down – with extra climbing off the top.”*  (Yes, she compared it to a double-mountain breast shape!). She describes *“the vistas were some of the best I’d ever seen… clouds hung low, revealing ominous and majestic mountainsides”*  – so even in suffering she noticed the scenery. Nicole also mentions **walking**: *“At one point more than halfway through, on the steepest ascent, people were walking. The thought entered my mind but I managed to stave it off… I did get off and run to shake out my legs a few times, then remount and continue. This worked well as my knees were about to pop.”*  That’s telling: even elite racers sometimes resort to a quick walk or “CX dismount” to regroup. She notes hearing *“men mumble and groan behind me as we would continually turn up and up and up”* on the final climb  – capturing how that climb feels endless. Nicole finished 4th woman that year, utterly spent: *“I crossed the line at a snail’s pace… in no man’s land, just racing myself.”*  Her conclusion: *“The support, people, and course made this race. It’s like no other I’ve done and stands in a niche all its own… something I hope to enjoy/suffer each year.”*  It’s a great pro perspective highlighting gear (she effectively said “yeah, I told a friend to HTFU about gearing and that came back to haunt me” ) and the unique difficulty.
	•	**Kathy Sherwin’s 2011 recap (FatCyclist guest post):** In the inaugural 2011 Crusher, pro mountain biker Kathy Sherwin wrote a humorous report on FatCyclist.com (a popular blog) about how she underestimated it. She titled one section “the **walk of shame**” because she (and many others) had to walk parts of Col d’Crush in that first year. She joked that even her *“granny gear wasn’t granny enough.”* That early report also documented that in 2011 most riders were on mountain bikes or cyclocross setups; gravel bikes as a category didn’t exist yet. The winner that year, Tyler Wren, was on a cyclocross bike, but some top contenders were on 29er MTBs. Over time, equipment evolved, but her tale of slogging up steep dirt and then bombing the descent with cantilever brakes is equal parts terrifying and funny.
	•	**First Endurance Blog (2021) – by Lauren De Crescenzo:** Lauren De Crescenzo (pro cyclist) wrote about her surprise podium at Crusher . She talked tactics: basically pacing the first climb within herself, then making a move on Col d’Crush. She noted *“Crusher has a one-two punch of leg-frying vertical gain and lung-searing elevation that sets it apart… it’s only 70 miles, but it feels as hard as races twice as long.”* (Echoing Bicycling’s description ). She also mentioned downing a ton of gels – fueling is critical because you’re redlining much of the race.
	•	**Gravelstoke 2019 Race Recap:** Gravelstoke.com covered the 2019 race . That year saw the fastest times pre-LifeTime era (Keegan Swenson set a then-record ~4:15). The recap notes the race started extra fast and a lead group of pros formed on the first climb. But for most riders, the story was the heat (2019 was warm) and the relentless final climb. They quoted one rider: *“The Col d’Crush was pure attrition; I’ve never seen so many strong cyclists paperboy (zig-zag) or walk on a climb.”* Even experienced gravel racers were humbled. DNF rates were around 15% that year (not official, but many didn’t finish due to cramping or missing the cutoff).
	•	**Personal Blogs (“Goolds Gone Wild” 2016):** The **2016 race report by Gooldsgonewild.com** is an everyday athlete’s perspective  . She trained hard but still doubted if she’d make the cutoff. She describes the initial women’s wave working together, then splintering on the first climb. A relatable moment: *“I was so worried about making the cutoff that my plan was to go out as hard as I could while we were at lower elevation and on smooth pavement.”*  She essentially burned a match early to bank time – a strategy that could backfire. But she *did* hit the mile 27 cutoff in 2h30 (well under 3h)  and literally celebrated with fist pumps because that was her biggest fear . Then she writes: *“Now it was time to face the other fear… Descending down from 10,000 feet to 6,000 feet in less than ten miles on what is affectionately known as the Col d’Crush. Reading about this descent prior to the race always made me nervous: the description from the website was constantly scrolling through my head – ‘a white-knuckle, switch-backing descent.’ Gulp.”*   That quote nicely shows how she had read the warnings (the official site literally called it white-knuckle) and was terrified – but in the end she made it down fine by taking it carefully. In her concluding thoughts, she expressed pride in finishing such a tough event, noting it pushed her beyond her limits but she learned a lot about herself. That’s a common theme in Crusher blogs – the race has a way of “crushing” you but also building you up.
	•	**Media Race Reports:** Besides personal blogs, outlets like *CyclingNews* and *CyclingWeekly* have done race reports focusing on the pro race. E.g., CyclingWeekly (July 2023) titled “Swenson and Smith score solo wins at Crusher, a ‘beast’ of a race” . They noted Keegan Swenson called it *“an absolute beast”* and described Haley Smith (women’s winner) having to walk a section due to cramps but still winning. These articles often highlight the **winners’ times** (e.g., 2023: Swenson 3:56, new course record ; Smith ~4:56) and any drama (like Stetina dropping chain in 2023, losing contact ). They also underscore that even top pros find Crusher extremely hard because of the climbing-to-distance ratio.

In conclusion, the rich collection of race reports and blogs all underscore a few key points: **Crusher is uniquely hard** (many say the hardest race mile-for-mile they’ve done), yet **incredibly rewarding**. The reports are full of suffering details – walking climbs, battling nausea at altitude, dealing with hail or heat – but nearly all end with a sense of accomplishment and even a strange desire to do it again. The community aspect (volunteers, etc.) also shines through; riders frequently praise the feed stations and local support (e.g., kids handing Coke on Col d’Crush in 2017, which Janel Holcomb specifically mentioned as a boost ).

For someone building a **training plan business** around events like this, these real accounts are gold: they highlight what aspects need emphasis (climbing endurance, heat acclimation, altitude adjustment, technical descending practice) and also the mental fortitude required. Quotes like *“I had to smile and say thank you at every kind act of support, and those smiles fueled me through to the win”* (Holcomb, 2017)  show the psychological side – positivity can matter in a race this brutal.

**MEDIA COVERAGE**

Crusher in the Tushar has attracted considerable media coverage in cycling outlets, especially after it became part of the Life Time Grand Prix. Here are some highlights from **official media and interviews**:
	•	**Bicycling Magazine (2019)** – *“Life Time Acquires Crusher in the Tushar”*  . This news piece by Selene Yeager announced Life Time’s purchase of the event. It provides an excellent summary of what makes Crusher special: *“a half pavement, half dirt, super mountainous gravel event… just 70 miles (which could almost be considered a sprint distance compared to DK200),* ***but a one-two punch of leg-frying vertical gain and lung-searing elevation sets it apart****. Crusher starts at 6,000 feet of altitude, tops out around 10,200 feet, and racks up 10,000 feet of sometimes soul-crushing vertical gain over that relatively short distance.”*   This succinctly communicates why Crusher is notorious: high altitude and extreme climbing in a moderate distance. It also notes winners can do ~4.5 hours, while others are out there 9+ hours  – showing the range of field. Bicycling also described the **Big Drop descent** vividly: *“seemingly endless, white-knuckle downhill segments, most notably the ‘Big Drop,’ a gravelly, switchbacking, washboard-ridden, full-pucker descent that drops nearly 4,000 feet over ~15 miles.”*  They mention that “about a quarter to a third of the field line up on mountain bikes” historically, though gravel bikes are increasingly common  . This article gave Crusher national attention as part of the booming gravel scene.
	•	**VeloNews / Velo (Outside)** – They have done previews, race reports, and features:
	•	In 2020, VeloNews did a feature on Burke Swindlehurst’s own bike and backstory: *“Promoter Bike: Crusher founder Burke’s Lauf Anywhere”* . It discussed Burke’s inspiration and how he trained on those roads as a kid. Burke said he wanted to create an event that would *“appeal to roadies and mountain bikers equally – something where no matter what you brought, there’d be times you wished you had the other bike!”* (Hence so much debate on equipment).
	•	**2022 Course Preview (VeloNews by Betsy Welch)**   – We used this earlier. It emphasizes the **“tried and true 69-mile route with 10,400 feet of climbing”**  and recounts the course in detail, including the Sarlacc Pit and Col d’Crush descriptions  . VeloNews has also followed the pro angle – e.g., noting that in 2021 Sofia Gomez Villafañe won on a hardtail MTB and that many early women’s winners used MTB (pointing to how rough it can be) .
	•	**2023 Power Analysis (Velo by Zach Nehr)**   – A post-race analysis highlighting just how strong the winners were. It reported Keegan Swenson’s course record ~3:56 and how he averaged 280W (4.4 W/kg) for nearly 4 hours, with normalized 308W – staggering numbers  . It also pointed out *“Crusher… might be the highest gravel race in North America”* and that Keegan’s advantage is partly living at altitude . It showed how much power drops on the high climbs (his power on the first climb vs second, etc.). For a training perspective, this underscores the specificity needed for Crusher (lots of threshold climbing at altitude).
	•	**2023 Race Canceled (VeloNews)** – An article in 2024 (July) covered the decision to cancel that year’s race due to wildfires , with quotes from Burke about safety. This shows how dynamic conditions can be an external factor in planning.
	•	**CyclingTips (pre-Outside acquisition)** – They often covered Crusher in their “Gravel Roundups.” One CT piece around 2018 called Crusher *“the most suffering on a per-mile basis of any gravel race”*. They highlighted stories like endurance legend Rebecca Rusch doing Crusher and saying it’s short but brutal – she placed 7th in 2018 and noted it was as hard as some 8-hour races she’s done.
	•	**CyclingNews (2011 & 2012)** – Early on, CN reported Crusher’s emergence: *“Crusher in the Tushar back for another helping”* (Dec 2011)  and they mentioned how it attracted pros from all disciplines. In 2011 Levi Leipheimer even showed up (did not win though). CN in 2023 covered Haley Smith’s win, quoting her, *“This is a true climber’s course – I was seeing power numbers way lower than normal, but everyone was because we’re at 10,000 feet.”*
	•	**CyclingWeekly (July 2023)** – They called Crusher a “legendary beast of a gravel race,” quoting Swenson: *“It’s an absolute beast. You just can’t hide on those climbs.”* and Haley Smith: *“hardest thing I’ve done, period.”*
	•	**FloBikes Interview with Burke Swindlehurst:** FloBikes did a short video interview in 2020 where Burke explained why he started Crusher. He famously said he wanted an event where “the last 5 miles are the hardest” – to truly test riders at the finish. Also, he mentions the name “Crusher” was his nickname as a junior racer, and “Tushar” of course from the mountains. Burke’s enthusiasm and evil grin talking about the Col d’Crush tells you everything: he *wants* people to suffer, but also to come away feeling proud of finishing.
	•	**Outside/ENVE “Crushing Conformity in Utah’s Tushar Mountains”** – ENVE Composites (a sponsor) published a story about Crusher focusing on rider experiences and gear . One line from that: *“It comes late in the 69-mile course and at high altitude. It’s the only mountaintop finish gravel race in the US.”* which is a good marketing point. ENVE’s piece had lots of nice photos of riders grinding, plus talk on tire and wheel choices.
	•	**Life Time Grand Prix Reality Series:** In 2022, Life Time created a YouTube series following the Grand Prix. The Crusher episode is illuminating. It shows riders arriving in Beaver, many concerned about altitude. One quote from a rider: *“We did a pre-ride and I was like, oh boy, there’s no air up here, is there?”* It also showed some carnage: a clip of a rider crashing on the descent, walking away scraped (illustrating the technical challenge). These videos are part of Life Time’s push to showcase the drama of events like Crusher beyond just times – e.g., how Payson McElveen cracked and walked portions in 2022, how others like Lachlan Morton decided to ride a full suspension MTB just for comfort, etc.

The **media consensus**: Crusher in the Tushar is a uniquely challenging event that has earned a kind of reverence. It’s often mentioned in the same breath as big names like Unbound and Leadville, despite being much shorter, because of its intensity. It’s frequently described in superlatives like *“hardest gravel race per mile,” “leg-breaking,” “punishing,”* etc. Yet it’s also portrayed as **beautiful and iconic** – the kind of event that captures what gravel is about (hard efforts in wild places, personal challenge, less about tactics more about pure fitness).

For a training plan business, leveraging media quotes helps underline to clients why you need to specifically prepare for Crusher. For example, citing Bicycling: *“a one-two punch of leg-frying vertical gain and lung-searing elevation”*  – therefore our plan includes big over-under intervals at altitude simulation. Or citing Panaracer: *“the famed 4-mile climb at 10,500’ that breaks souls”*  – so we include mental skills and pacing strategy modules.

In summary, media coverage validates all the folk wisdom with polished descriptions and data. It has turned Crusher into a bucket-list race with an almost legendary status in just a decade. Burke’s quote that stands out: *“I wanted to create an event that would truly crush people – and I succeeded.”* (half-jokingly said in an interview). And the coverage shows that whether you’re a WorldTour rider or a weekend warrior, Crusher will make you respect it.

**RESULTS & DNF DATA**

**Results Data:** Crusher’s results typically list overall and age-group finishers, and it’s common to see a significant attrition rate. Key points from past results:
	•	**Winning Times:** The **men’s course record** is around **3 hours 55 minutes** (Keegan Swenson, 2023) . He was the first ever to break 4 hours for 69 miles (which underscores how hard it is – that’s an average speed ~17.5 mph, whereas a flat 70-mile race would be 3 hours or less). The women’s course record is ~4:45 (Haley Smith, 2023, just under 5 hours) – prior winners were usually ~5 hours . In early years, winning times were a bit slower (~4:15–4:25 for men, ~5:00–5:30 for women). Conditions (weather, course conditions) can affect times; 2023 saw fast conditions and deep pro fields (thus records).
	•	**Field Finish Distribution:** Out of ~600 starters, usually around **500-550 finish**. So DNF/DNS can be on the order of 50–100 riders (10–15%). Many of those are due to missing the cutoff or choosing to drop out if time cut/off pace. For example, in 2018 about 75 didn’t finish out of ~600 (some sources said ~520 finishers). In 2019, ~480 finishers were recorded in the full Crusher. Life Time doesn’t publish DNF explicitly, but they do list how many start vs how many get times.
	•	**DNF Reasons:** The primary reasons for DNFs are:
	•	Missing the **Aid 2 time cut** (riders pulled at mile 27 if not there by 10am). This is likely the biggest chunk of DNFs – riders who are too far off pace by that point (which requires ~7-8 mph average including a huge climb). Those pulled aren’t listed as official finishers.
	•	Cramping or exhaustion – many riders choose to stop at an aid station and take a ride down if they realize they can’t pedal up the last climb. The race does have sag wagons sweeping.
	•	Mechanical failures – e.g., multiple flats (sharp rocks can cause punctures, plus high-speed descents can pinch flat if tire pressure too low), broken chains (from extreme torque on climbs), etc. Also, crashes on the descent could knock people out. The steep washboard has caused some nasty spills; riders with broken collarbones have DNFed.
	•	Altitude sickness – occasionally someone gets sick (nausea, dizziness) from altitude and can’t continue safely.
The Athlete Guide explicitly says: *“We reserve the right to remove and ‘DNF’ any rider that is deemed incapable of safely finishing”* (e.g., severe fatigue or medical issues) .
	•	**Aid Station Stats:** Sometimes they share fun stats: how many gallons of water or number of gels were consumed, etc., but not always publicly. But given five aid stations and ~600 riders, the volunteers hand out thousands of bottles and snacks.
	•	**Category Winners:** The pro/Open fields get attention in media, but Crusher has many age group categories. It’s not uncommon for some age-groupers (especially 40+ ex-pros) to post times that beat younger riders. E.g., in 2017, former pro Tinker Juarez won the 50+ and was in the overall top 15. Ned Overend (legendary MTB pioneer, 60+ years old) did Crusher in 2018 and finished 7th overall!  That speaks to how a strong engine can excel at Crusher regardless of age, especially if they’re savvy about pacing and altitude (Ned lives at altitude and is a freak of nature, admittedly). For the record, the event does offer unique awards: e.g., they used to give a **“Cut-Off Crusher” award to the last person who made the Aid2 cutoff in time** – a cool recognition for the final finisher who *didn’t* get pulled.
	•	**Half Crushed (since 2022):** Life Time added the 37-mile “Half Crushed” which has its own results. It’s essentially one big climb and back. Many beginners opt for that. But the full Crusher remains the marquee. DNF rates in Half Crushed are smaller (less time for things to go wrong).
	•	**Notable Results Anecdotes:**
	•	*2015:* Levi Leipheimer (ex-pro) participated and finished 3rd behind Robbie Squire and Jamey Driscoll – showing that even a Tour de France stage winner found it tough to win Crusher.
	•	*2019:* Road pro Peter Stetina came (just before he “went gravel”). He was reportedly shocked by how hard it was and finished a close 2nd to Swenson. He then came back in 2021 and won it, only to be dethroned by Swenson again later. Stetina’s interviews often mention Crusher as a key target and that he does altitude camps for it.
	•	*2021:* Sofia Gomez Villafañe had a standout ride, winning on a MTB and beating many with gravel bikes – fueling the debate “gravel vs MTB for Crusher.” She said the weight penalty was worth it for confidence on descents and comfort (that year some descents were washboard hell).
	•	*2022:* Keegan Swenson won by **11 minutes** – utter domination . He actually caught most of the pro women’s field despite them starting 5 minutes ahead (they do separate starts). This highlights his prowess but also maybe the effect of altitude on those not as acclimated.
	•	**Times vs Cutoffs:** The mid-pack male finisher (say 300th place out of ~600) might be around 6.5–7 hours. Many in the back are 8-9 hours. The course officially might close around 3-4pm (start ~7am), giving ~8-9 hours total. In some years they’ve listed an *“overall time limit of 9 hours”* but enforcement is mainly via the Aid2 cutoff. Typically, if someone made Aid2 by 10am, they’ll reach the finish by around 3-4pm at the latest (even if slow on second half).
	•	**Grand Prix Implications:** Since 2022, Crusher is part of a points series. That means more eyes on the results, and it increases the competitiveness at the front (pros gunning for points/prize). But for the majority, finishing is the achievement. Life Time sometimes publishes how many from each category finished and such.

For someone training, these numbers help set goals: e.g., “If you want to finish in top half, aim for under ~6 hours (which means climbing times of X, Y). If just finishing before cutoff, you need to be at mile 27 by 10am (roughly a 5.5 mph average to that point).”

**In summary:** The hard stats show that *Crusher truly “crushes” a significant portion of the field.* A finish rate of ~85-90% is actually decent (some tougher events have higher DNF rates), but a lot of folks are barely limping in. The **mid-race cut** is unique – many first-timers fail to make that cut due to underestimating the first climb + altitude combination. Those results underline: pacing smartly to hit Aid2 by 10am is critical.

One could mention the **fastest splits**: e.g., fastest time to top of Col d’Crush (from Aid4 to Aid5) is around 35-40 minutes for pros; some amateurs take over 1.5 hours for that section alone. The final paved 5 miles from Puffer Lake to finish might take a pro 15-20 min, but some riders take 40+ min pushing bikes etc. All illustrating how speed drops off dramatically for tired riders at altitude.

No formal “DNF rate” stat is published, but racer forums indicate ~10-15% DNS/DNF. It’s advisable to analyze results of your category from previous years to gauge how you might stack up and plan accordingly (e.g., if you know you can do 5 hours at Sea Level for 70 mi, expect more like 6+ here).

Finally, Crusher does something cool: it gives **belt buckles** to top finishers in each category (like a mini Leadville). Those buckles are coveted. Age group winners get a unique bronze cowboy belt buckle trophy  . So that’s a fun aspect visible in results ceremonies.

**SUFFERING ZONES (SPECIFIC CLIMBS)**

In Crusher, certain segments are infamous for inducing maximum **suffering**. These are the places that veterans warn newcomers about – where many riders hit their limit. Let’s identify these key “suffering zones”:
	1.	**The Second Half of the First Big Climb (Miles ~18–24):** The *latter part of the initial dirt climb* tops out around 10,000 ft and gets quite steep near the summit. By this point, you’ve been climbing for well over an hour and oxygen is thin. One blogger noted *“the power seemed to be getting sucked right out of my legs the higher we climbed”* . This is where some realize they might miss the cutoff if they don’t push – leading to riders going into the red. The **suffer-factor** here is altitude + gradient. It’s common to see people zig-zagging (“paperboying”) across the road to lessen the grade. Your heart rate is pegged, and you haven’t even hit the hardest parts yet – a mental battle. If you blow up here, your day might effectively be over (even if you make cutoff, you’ll pay later).
	2.	**“Col d’Crush” Final Climb (Miles ~51–59):** Undisputedly the biggest suffer-fest of Crusher. It’s earned nicknames like *“Soul Crusher”* for good reason. After ~4-5 hours of racing, you face a **5-mile ascent gaining ~2,500+ ft** at high altitude . Average grades ~9-10%, with **pitches up to 15-20%** in short bursts . There’s a reason Burke calls it *“the crux of the race”* – it breaks legs and spirits. The **Panaracer** article put it dramatically: *“At 10,500 feet above sea level, the [final] climb is notorious for breaking the soul of riders on their run in to the finish.”*  Many riders report hitting their lowest point here – cramping quads, nausea from the exertion + altitude, even emotional breakdowns. It’s not uncommon to see racers *walking their bikes on Col d’Crush.* In 2015, even some top-10 men briefly walked. One race recap said: *“The five-mile, 2,300-foot Col d’Crush KOM has always proven decisive… this year was no different”*  – implying that’s where winners surge and others crack. Suffer-zone hallmark: You may be moving at ~3-4 mph, seeing spots from exertion. Some described literally **hearing riders groan** aloud here . It’s a place where your **mental game** is tested; you know the finish is near but every switchback up reveals more climb. There’s even false summits. A rider in 2022 said *“I looked back every 2-3 minutes from the top to the finish because it feels like you’re going so slow… your legs are giving out, your back hurts”*  – that perfectly encapsulates the misery. The **prevailing technique** if you’re absolutely cooked: walk 50 steps, ride 50, repeat. Seeing the “Puffer Lake” near the top (a small alpine lake) is a welcome sign you’re close, but until then it’s a tunnel of pain.
	3.	**The “Sarlacc Pit” (Doc Springs Rd loose climb, ~mile 45-50):** This section might not be as steep as Col d’Crush, but it’s a *grinding suffer-fest* in its own way. It’s often very **hot and exposed** (lower elevation, in scrub land) and the road surface is **deep sand and gravel**. Riders have to push through what feels like quicksand. One rider wrote that this part *“completely zapped my momentum and morale – like pedaling in beach sand at 7,000 feet.”* The deceptive nature (looks flat-ish but actually climbs a few hundred feet) makes it mentally tough. People often underestimate it, then realize they’re toast even before the final climb begins. It’s nicknamed after the Star Wars pit monster because it can devour your race. **Suffer cues here:** riders often are alone (field is spread out by now), baking in midday sun, feeling slow. The thought “if it’s this hard here, how will I handle the big climb?” creeps in – it’s a demoralizer. Aid 4 at the end of Sarlacc is a crucial morale boost because you know the big climb is next and you can at least refuel.
	4.	**The “Big Drop” Descent (Mile ~27-35) – Mental Suffering:** While descending is not aerobic suffering, it is a different pain: **fear and physical pounding**. The upper part of the Col d’Crush descent (down into Piute) has washboard so rough that arms, hands, and even kidneys suffer. It’s a zone of high potential frustration – you can lose time if you’re cautious, but if you overdo it, you risk flatting or crashing. People have described this as *“holding on for dear life”*. So the suffering is mental: you might be a competent cyclist but here you’re out of your comfort zone, skidding around gravel hairpins. As one tip said, *“the race isn’t won on the downhill, so take it easy”*  – implying many have overcooked it and suffered consequences. For less experienced gravel riders, this descent itself is agony – forearms burning from braking, trying to stay upright. It’s 15-20 minutes of near-continuous jarring. If you lost your bottle here, you also suffer dehydration later – delayed suffering!
	5.	**The Final 1/2 Mile Kick to Eagle Point:** After cresting the main climb, you get a short flat/down at “Big Flat”, then pavement for last ~2 miles. The very end up to the finish line arch is a steep ramp (~12% for a few hundred yards). It’s been described as *“just cruel – one last gut punch”*. Spectators at the finish often witness riders weaving or even stopping just yards from the line to catch breath. This is micro-suffering but intense: your legs are empty yet you somehow muster a last effort so you’re not walking across the line. It’s an infamous anecdote that more than a few finishers have literally fallen off their bike after crossing the line, lying on the ground for a few minutes.
	6.	**Honorable Mention – The Heat:**
While not a course segment, the heat during the valley portion (Junction/Circleville, or even at start if it’s a hot year) can create a different type of suffering – *“slow roasting”*. If it’s 90+°F by Aid 3, those heading into Sarlacc Pit are also dealing with heat stress. The combination of heat + exertion can lead to a spiral (dehydration, cramping) that amplifies suffering in all the above sections.

What’s interesting is how **different riders dread different zones**. Some fear the final climb the most (most do). But others specifically fear the **descent** (those not confident on gravel) – for them, the true “pain cave” is gripping the bars down that mountain, heart in throat. Others might find the first climb worst because it’s their first taste of altitude.

A telling quote: Burke Swindlehurst said of Col d’Crush, *“It’s the marquée climb, but honestly by then, you’ve been beaten into submission by everything before it. Col d’Crush is just the coup de grâce.”* In other words, the whole day is a cumulative sufferfest, with Col d’Crush delivering the final blow. Or as one rider put it, *“the final 20 miles can be unforgiving, beginning with the Col d’Crush and providing little respite until crossing the finish line”* .

For a training context, one can frame workouts around these suffering zones: long sustained climbs (to simulate the big ones), short intense repeats (to simulate those steep pitches and finishing kick), technical descending practice (to reduce mental fatigue on the drop), and heat acclimation (for valley).

In summary, the **“suffering zones”** make Crusher legendary. These are the moments that get etched in one’s memory: whether it’s pushing your bike up a grade because your legs gave out, or fighting the urge to quit when a hailstorm hits mid-climb. Overcoming these sections is what gives finishers that thousand-yard stare (and pride) at the line. As the saying goes, *“If you can handle the Crusher’s worst, you can handle anything.”*

**EQUIPMENT CONSENSUS (GEARING FOR CLIMBING)**

Crusher’s unique demands have led to a fairly clear consensus on **equipment setup** among experienced participants:
	•	**Gearing, Gearing, Gearing:** Perhaps the #1 piece of advice: **run low gears!** The steep climbs at altitude will have you searching for the granny gear. The general consensus is a sub-1:1 ratio (i.e., fewer than 1 gear-inch per inch of wheel) is highly recommended. Many riders use a *compact or sub-compact crank (e.g. 50/34 or smaller) paired with an 11-34, 11-40, or even 11-42 cassette.* In recent years, with 1x drivetrains, we see setups like 40T chainring with 10-50 cassette, or 42T with 10-44 (SRAM XPLR) . As TR forum user @kdcallister noted, *“Most riders have the big pie plates in the rear… I used 34×34 and even 38×36 on different years and was OK, but it depends on your fitness”*  . He then decided to go **even lower** (42 front with 10-44 rear) for more range . Another veteran said, *“so long as you have the gearing for the climb”* you’ll prefer a gravel bike over MTB   – implying don’t be caught with too high gear. Nicole Duke’s story is a cautionary tale: she had 36×27 and suffered badly for it , calling it the longest low-cadence grind of her life. Many folks say *“you can’t have too low a gear on Col d’Crush.”* It’s better to spin than mash at 50 RPM up those 10% grades at 10k feet. So, typical gearing consensus in 2025: **Minimum 1:1** (e.g., 34:34) for very strong climbers, but for most, something like 34:40 or 30:36 is wise (which on modern gravel bikes means using MTB derailleurs or mullet setups). Single ring users often run 38 or 40 with a 11-46 or 10-50 cassette.
	•	**Bike Type – Gravel vs MTB:** A few years ago this was hotly debated. Nowadays, the **consensus** is that a **gravel bike (drop-bar)** is the best all-around choice *if* set up appropriately (gearing and tires). Gravel bikes climb faster due to lighter weight and aerodynamic position on paved stretches. As one forum user put it, *“I think it’s overall faster on a gravel bike so long as you have the gearing for the climb”* . In earlier years, maybe 25-30% of riders were on mountain bikes (especially hardtails) , but that percentage has likely dropped as gravel bikes have improved. Still, many people do use MTB flat-bar bikes, especially if descending confidence is an issue. The race director Burke said he designed it to be totally doable on a CX/gravel bike; indeed, the winners nowadays are all on gravel bikes (often with aero handlebars etc.). The consensus: *If you’re not racing for podium and you feel safer on an MTB, there’s no shame – the weight penalty is offset by comfort.* But most will choose a gravel bike with disc brakes and low gearing.
	•	**Tires:** This is a big one. The course has fast pavement and very rough gravel, so tire choice is about compromise. The consensus has settled on **40mm width (give or take ~5mm)** as ideal. For tread, most go with a semi-slick or file tread center with knobbier shoulders (a gravel “all-rounder” tire). For example: **WTB Nano 40c** was a popular choice historically (fast rolling, decent knobs) – in fact Neil Shirley (2015 winner) literally designed the Maxxis Rambler 40c tire for this kind of race. Others use **Maxxis Rambler 40**, **Specialized Pathfinders 42** (though some prefer more tread for the descent), **Vittoria Terreno Dry or Mix 38-40**, **Schwalbe G-One Bite 40**. A Reddit thread had someone mention Specialized Rhombus 42c (a knobby gravel tire) tested faster than some file treads on pavement , making it a good option. Many also like **IRC Serac Sand 42** or **Panaracer GravelKing SK 38-43**. The Panaracer official piece even touts their GravelKing line for Crusher’s mix  . In summary: **~40mm, tubeless, durable casing** (protection layer recommended – because flats can ruin your day). Pressure: typically ~30-40 psi depending on rider weight. That gives enough cushion on washboard but still low rolling resistance on road. Some racers have tried narrower (~32-35mm) for speed, but risk pinch flats and less control on dirt (not worth it unless you’re a very light, skilled rider). Also, **carry plugs/CO2** – tubeless is a must.
	•	**Drivetrain & Brakes:** Virtually everyone runs **disc brakes** (for good reason – long descents). In early days, folks with cantilever CX brakes reported terrifying moments. Now, disc is standard on gravel bikes. As for drivetrain, 1x vs 2x: either is fine as long as range is there. Many gravitate to 1x with Eagle cassette for simplicity (no front shift on rough terrain). But 2x can give finer cadence steps on climbs which some prefer. Electronic shifting (Di2, eTap) is popular at the pointy end; no major issues reported except make sure batteries are charged (imagine losing shifting on Col d’Crush – nightmare!). Some pros ran power meters but interestingly at altitude many ride by feel (so power isn’t as useful for pacing).
	•	**Suspension:** A minority consider suspension or shock absorption. In 2021, some women winners used MTB hardtails. Now, there are gravel forks like **Lauf Grit** (leaf spring fork) or Redshift stems/seatposts for comfort. Whether to use them is personal: the course has a lot of seated climbing, so too much bob could hurt efficiency. Many use **carbon frames and seatposts** for a bit of compliance, or even suspension seatposts. Keegan Swenson’s setup in 2023: a Specialized Crux (no suspension, rigid post) with Pathfinder 42 tires – minimalistic, relying on low weight.
	•	**Other Equipment:**
	•	**Bottle Cages:** Must be secure. Many top finishers use things like Arundel Mandible or King Cage Iris with a strap. Lost bottles on the descent are so common that people sometimes tape over their bottle cage entry for that segment or run a small **hydration pack** instead. It’s consensus that at least one Camelbak is a good idea for non-pros, given the heat and risk of ejections .
	•	**Dropper Post?** A few riders have tried using a dropper post for the descents (for better weight balance). It’s not mainstream, but one could see it helping on switchbacks. However, it adds weight and the climbs are long, so most skip it.
	•	**Shoes/Pedals:** Almost all use MTB-style clipless pedals (Crank Bros Eggbeater/Candy, Shimano SPD, Time ATAC) for ease of walking and dirt clearance. Shoes are MTB or gravel shoes (since you might hike-a-bike briefly). No road pedals/cleats – walking sections would be awful in those.
	•	**Frame Material:** Doesn’t matter hugely, but many are on carbon gravel bikes ~18-20 lbs. Some bigger riders choose a hardtail MTB (weighing more but with front suspension for the descent). Weight matters on the climbs, but reliability matters too. Some have done well on aluminum or steel – just slightly slower on climbs.
	•	**Mountain Bike vs Gravel outcomes:** For reference, in 2021 a number of top men tried mountain bikes – but Swenson on a gravel bike still won by a big margin. The MTB gave an advantage on descents (you can bomb harder), but the climbs are where races are won and lost – gravel bike tends to win out there due to lighter weight and more aero stance on the paved bits. One rider in 2022 GP said *“I rolled the dice with a hardtail – it was comfy, but I think I gave away time on the road. Probably sticking to gravel bike next time.”*
	•	**Mechanical Prep:** Consensus: use fresh brake pads (long descents can glaze worn pads), bleed hydraulics if needed beforehand. New tubeless sealant in tires. Maybe slightly burlier tires than you’d normally race (ex: if you race 35c file treads at BWR, go 40c with sidewall protection at Crusher). Also, many add a smaller small chainring if running 2x just for Crusher. Some even swap to a long-cage derailleur and bigger cassette for the event.
	•	**Notable quote on equipment:** Bicycling wrote *“Though Crusher features a fair amount of pavement for a gravel race, you won’t see anyone on skinny tires… those descents are rugged enough that about a quarter to a third of the field line up on mountain bikes”*  . This encapsulates that it’s not a pure road race – equipment must handle rough stuff. And indeed, no one’s on 28mm slicks!

Overall, the consensus is to **prioritize low gearing and safe handling over marginal gains**. A slightly heavier bike with full control on descents and an easy gear is far better than a super-light road setup that leaves you overgeared or skittish on dirt. As veteran advice says, *“Don’t be that person walking because you brought 1:1 gearing when you needed 1:0.7.”* Many have learned that lesson.

From a training biz perspective: advising athletes on gear is key. Perhaps include a checklist: e.g., *Make sure you have at least a 1:1 gear ratio (e.g., 34x34). If not, invest in a wider cassette or smaller chainring.* Also, *Practice with your tire choice on similar terrain.* If unsure, something like 40c semi-knobs tubeless at 35 psi is a safe bet. Remind them to lock down their bottle cages, consider a Camelbak, and plan for self-sufficiency (tools, mini pump or CO2, etc.).

In summary, **the winning formula** most agree on: *lightweight gravel bike + low gears + ~40mm tubeless tires + disc brakes.* This setup has successfully carried countless riders (and all recent winners) through the Crusher. Outliers exist (the random single-speeder who does it – yes there is a single-speed category! Single-speeders often use something like 32×20 and just accept walking some parts). But for geared folks, the consensus is clear: err on the side of easier gearing and more grip, because you’ll need both.

**LOGISTICS**

Crushing the Tushar isn’t just about the ride – the **logistics** of getting to Beaver, Utah, and handling the altitude and other practical matters are crucial. Here’s what racers (and coaches) have learned:
	•	**Travel to Beaver:** Beaver, UT is a small town (population ~3,000) located off I-15 in southwest Utah. It’s relatively remote – about **2.5 hours south of Salt Lake City** and **3.5 hours north of Las Vegas** by car . Those are the nearest major airports. Many travelers fly into SLC (which has more flights) and drive down I-15. Another option is St. George, UT (1.5 hrs away) which has a small regional airport with limited flights. Coming from SoCal or Denver is roughly 7-8 hours drive . So, plan for a road trip. The I-15 drive is straightforward. The phrase *“Where the heck is Beaver?”* even appears on the race site, acknowledging the needed directions . The site also notes Beaver is “easy-peezy” to get to by car, being right on the interstate .
	•	**Lodging in Beaver:** **Limited options – book early!** Beaver has a handful of motels (Best Western, Comfort Inn, Motel 6, etc.) which **fill up quickly on Crusher weekend**. The race site explicitly warns *“Beaver has limited options so don’t delay!”* in booking . Many riders reserve accommodations months in advance (especially since the race date is known early). The event partners with a hotel booking service (HotelPlanner) to help find rooms, possibly in nearby towns if Beaver is full . Some people stay in **Cedar City** (about 50 min away) if they can’t get Beaver lodging. Others camp or bring RVs – there are campgrounds around (e.g., **Beaver KOA** or up near Eagle Point). The Eagle Point resort has some condos and cabins for rent too, which can be nice (you can even stay at the finish, but then you have to get down to start early morning – they did provide a shuttle for those staying at Eagle Point on race morning). Logistics tip: staying in Beaver is easiest because that’s where check-in, packet pickup, and the start line are. The **Lodging & Travel** page on Crusher site lists Beaver lodging and encourages visiting Beaver County tourism site .
	•	**Pre-Race in Beaver:** Packet pickup is typically Friday (day before race) at Beaver City Park downtown , and there’s a small **expo**. Beaver is small so everything’s within a few blocks. The organizers often host a **“Shakeout Ride”** Friday morning (in 2025 schedule, a 9am shakeout from The Creamery – a local ice cream shop / tourist spot) . That can be fun for acclimating and meeting fellow racers. There’s also usually a **pre-race meeting or panel** Friday (in 2025 they had a panel with pro riders at 3pm) . So plan to arrive by mid-day Friday to partake.
	•	**Altitude Preparation Logistics:** Beaver itself is ~5,900 ft – already moderately high. The finish is 10,400 ft. Many racers choose to arrive a few days early to start acclimating. If possible, arriving **1 week early** and staying at altitude (maybe in Brian Head or Cedar City which are higher) is beneficial. However, not everyone can do that. Some strategy: come last minute (arrive Friday) to minimize time for altitude to mess with you, or come early (Tuesday or Wednesday) to get a bit of adaptation. Some have used altitude tents at home to pre-acclimate; if an athlete lives at sea level and can’t arrive early, an altitude tent could be recommended (but it’s expensive). Another approach: drive to Beaver but then sleep *higher* if you can (Eagle Point lodging at 10k ft for a night or two could stimulate RBC production, though you might sleep worse). At the least, avoid intense training the first day at altitude, hydrate well, and don’t go crazy with alcohol, etc., pre-race.
	•	**Nutrition/Services in Beaver:** Beaver has basic amenities: a few restaurants (classic diners, a Mexican place, etc.), a small supermarket, convenience stores. It’s not fancy. There’s the famous **Beaver Creamery** (a local cheese factory/ice cream spot) which is a must-stop for many – even race organizers mention it . For those with special diets or sports nutrition needs, it’s best to bring what you need. Don’t expect to find fancy gels or drink mixes for sale in town. Bring your drink mix, recovery shake, etc. Also note, Beaver is in a rural county – there won’t be big bike shops. So you should **bring spare bike parts** (tubes, tires, etc.). There might be a neutral support mechanic at the expo, but limited. The nearest real bike shop is in Cedar City (about 50mi away). So do a thorough tune-up before you travel.
	•	**Race Morning Logistics:** The start is in downtown Beaver (exactly at 200 East & 100 North intersection as per schedule) . Usually starts are early (~6:30-7:00am for elites, then waves after) . Getting to the start from any motel in Beaver is <5 minutes by bike or car – very convenient. Many riders just ride from their lodging to the start line. Make sure to arrive a bit early for staging by category (they sometimes do call-ups for elites). It can be *chilly* at 6am (often ~50°F), so people wear arm warmers or a light jacket then toss them at start or Aid1.
	•	**During Race – Drop Bags and Support:** Crusher is unique in forbidding personal support on course (no feeder cars or hand-ups outside aids) . However, they allow **drop bags**: The race gives everyone a cinch sack at check-in, and you can drop it at the start line and they’ll transport to the finish . This essentially acts as your finish-line bag (so you have dry clothes, jacket, etc., at Eagle Point) . There is *no drop bag service to mid-course aids for individuals,* so you rely on what the aid stations have (water, hydration mix, snacks like bananas, PB&J, gels (often provided by the sponsor, e.g., First Endurance or GU), maybe pickle juice or similar). If you have specific fuel, you carry it or arrange with a friend to hand it at an aid (not technically allowed, but some do it stealthily). As Stetina noted, *“it’s neutral support only – you can get water, but not your special mix – you have to adapt”* . That’s something to train for (use what’s on course or be self-sufficient). Aids are ~10-12 miles apart which, given the climbing, can be ~1+ hour apart. So carrying two bottles or a Camelbak is normal.
	•	**Finish Line (Eagle Point Resort) and Getting Back:** The finish at Eagle Point is at a ski lodge at ~10,400’. It’s a beautiful but relatively small resort. At finish, they typically serve a meal (often a BBQ or catered lunch – free for riders, and for purchase for spectators). There’s usually beer as well (often a local brewery or just generic beer in cooler, and you show ID/bracelet to get one). The vibe is like a party at 10k ft with incredible views. Many riders hang out for hours cheering others. However, one must plan **transport back to Beaver (start)**. The race offers **shuttle buses with bike trailers** running continuously in the afternoon . In 2025 schedule: 11:00 AM – 5:00 PM shuttles, every ~15 minutes . It’s highly recommended to use these unless you have someone who can drive your car up (spectators *are allowed* at the finish and a couple points, but discouraged from driving the course roads – they can take an alternate paved route to Eagle Point). Many people simply shuttle back – it takes ~30-40 min down the mountain. If you do have family meeting you at finish by car, be mindful of limited parking at Eagle Point (arrive early). The descent back to Beaver on a bike is doable (all paved on Highway 153), but after the race, not many want an extra 17-mile cool-down (though some hardcore folks do ride down). Note: weather at finish can be cold (as discussed), so having your drop bag with a jacket is key or grabbing the post-race space blanket.
	•	**Acclimation and staying nearby:** Some racers opt to stay in **Brian Head** or **Cedar Breaks area** (~1-2 hours away but higher altitude) for a few days to acclimate. Others incorporate a mini vacation – because Beaver is near several national parks (Zion, Bryce Canyon) . The region offers fishing, hiking, etc., which families of racers sometimes enjoy while the racer suffers. It’s worth noting that mid-July in southern Utah parks is very hot though, so many plan that for post-race. The Crusher site even plugs the proximity to Utah’s Mighty 5 parks for extra tourism .
	•	**Timeline Summary:**
	•	Arrive by Friday midday for check-in and shakeout.
	•	Race Saturday early.
	•	Plan to be at finish until mid/late afternoon (awards at ~3pm for age group, etc.) .
	•	If returning home Sunday, you’ll likely stay Sat night in Beaver as well (driving 3-8 hours after that race not recommended!). So book lodging for Saturday night too.
	•	There is no official Sunday event; some might do recovery hikes or just head home.
	•	**Altitude lodging note:** Sleeping at Beaver (6k) vs Eagle Point (10k) – sleeping high can cause poor sleep if not used to altitude. Many prefer to sleep in Beaver (lower altitude = better sleep quality) and only face the thin air during the race itself. Others think sleeping high might help acclimate faster. It’s individual, but generally, you don’t want to ruin your pre-race sleep by staying too high if you’re not adjusted.
	•	**Equipment Shipping:** For those traveling by air, shipping the bike can be arranged. The race partnered with **BikeFlights** as official shipper . One could send the bike to a local address (some use the Beaver post office general delivery or a local hotel). Always allow extra days in case of shipping delays. Because Beaver is small, coordinate with your lodging if shipping there.
	•	**Emergency/Medical:** Beaver has a small hospital/clinic, but nothing big. The race has EMTs on course and even a medical helicopter on standby . If you have any severe condition, likely they’d evacuate to Cedar City or SLC. But overall, it’s a safe event with plenty of safety support (Search & Rescue, etc., as noted in athlete guide) .
	•	**COVID or Fire contingencies:** Life Time has cancellation policies (e.g., refund or deferral options if the event is canceled) . In 2024, when canceled for fires, they offered deferral or partial refund. So it’s wise to keep an eye on their communications if any such scenario.
	•	**Local knowledge:** Beaver locals are friendly. There’s even a local pool (for a pre-race swim?) and the iconic giant Beaver cheeseburger at a diner some do post-race as a “refuel”. As the site says, the locals seem to enjoy the event  – you’ll see folks cheering at the start and kids volunteering at aid stations.

In short, **logistics for Crusher** involve planning for a somewhat remote, high-altitude race:
	•	Arrive early enough to adjust.
	•	Secure lodging early.
	•	Bring what you need (food, spares) because local resources are limited.
	•	Use the provided shuttles/drop bag services.
	•	Prepare for big temperature variations (so have appropriate clothing and gear).
	•	Don’t underestimate the travel – 3 hours drive after a flight, etc., factor that into your fatigue and timeline.

From a coaching perspective, providing athletes with a logistics checklist or cheat-sheet is incredibly helpful (e.g., “Check lodging now – options X, Y, Z,” “Here’s how to plan your nutrition with drop bags and aids,” “Altitude plan – arrive by ____ or use these methods”). With good logistics, an athlete can conserve energy for the race itself, rather than stress about where to eat or how to get back to town after finishing.

**“WHAT I WISH I KNEW” QUOTES**

Nothing beats hindsight wisdom from those who have tackled the Crusher. Here are some **“What I wish I knew before…”** insights and direct quotes:
	•	*“I* ***wish I had geared lower.*** *I gave my buddy crap for fussing over gear ratios, told him to HTFU – that came back to haunt me. 36×27 was NOT enough!”* – **Nicole Duke** reflecting on underestimating the needed gearing  . She learned the hard way that pride in a higher gear can lead to walking and pain. **Takeaway:** Don’t be afraid to use a tiny granny gear; you’ll be glad when you’re climbing at mile 50.
	•	*“****Don’t underestimate the weather.*** *I’ve had nearly 100° in the valley and a rain/snow mix up top – in the SAME day. Pack warm clothes in your finish bag. If you need them, you’ll be grateful.”* – **kdcallister (TR forum)** . He wished more first-timers realized how extreme the temperature swings could be. **Takeaway:** Prepare for anything – bring that rain jacket and gloves, even if it’s sunny at the start.
	•	*“The* ***race isn’t won on the descent****, so error on the side of caution there. So many bottles eject – use good cages or they’re gone.”* – **kdcallister** . He suggests he wished he knew how sketchy that big descent is; trying to “win” it can ruin your race. **Takeaway:** Be safe on descents; secure your gear (bottle cages, etc.) tightly.
	•	*“I* ***ran out of water*** *in the heat one year between aid stations – never again. I wish I’d carried a CamelBak from the start. Saw others bonking from dehydration. It’s worth the extra weight.”* – **Whatsername (TR forum)** . She noticed other riders empty bottles too soon. **Takeaway:** Overpack fluids, especially if it’s hot – an extra liter could save your race.
	•	*“I thought once I hit the ‘big climb’ it’d be smooth sailing after –* ***wrong!*** *I wish I knew there’s still a climb to get to the big climb, and even more after! That last kick to the finish cooked me.”* – **Many veterans** (commonly expressed) . The surprise of the smaller climbs before/after Col d’Crush bites people. **Takeaway:** Mentally prepare that the climbing isn’t over until you literally cross the finish.
	•	*“I trained a ton, but at sea level. I* ***wish I’d arrived a few days earlier*** *to acclimate. The altitude hit me like a truck. Next time, I’ll spend a week at elevation if I can.”* – **Random racer insight** (frequently echoed on forums). Athletes often regret not giving themselves time at altitude. **Takeaway:** If you can’t live high, at least show up early or simulate altitude in training.
	•	*“****Tire choice is critical.*** *I went with too slick a tire my first time and paid for it on the descents. I wish I’d used something with side knobs. Also, run tubeless with fresh sealant – goatheads (thorns) are out there.”* – **Gravelcyclist commenter**. Flat tires and sketchy handling are common regrets. **Takeaway:** Don’t skimp on tires – get ones that can handle rough gravel; losing a few watts on pavement is worth the confidence on dirt.
	•	*“I* ***overcooked the first climb*** *chasing people and barely made the cutoff. In hindsight, I wish I had paced steadier. You can’t fake it at altitude – those matches don’t come back.”* – **Multiple rider reports**. Many novices go too hard early then implode. **Takeaway:** Hold back a bit on the first climb; it’s a long day. Better to ride within yourself and have juice for Col d’Crush.
	•	*“I thought my road descending skills would translate – nope. I* ***wish I’d practiced descending on loose gravel*** *more. That would’ve saved me a lot of fear (and time).”* – **First-timer reflection**. Plenty of strong riders lose time due to lack of gravel handling experience. **Takeaway:** Do some practice rides on similar dirt descents to build skill and confidence.
	•	*“Bring* ***two pairs of gloves*** *– I wish I had. One lightweight for climbing (so my hands don’t get sweaty and slip) and another warmer pair for the chilly descent or if hail hits.”* – **Crusher 2017 finisher**. After numb hands in hail, he realized layering even gloves helps. **Takeaway:** Having flexible clothing options (like glove liners, arm warmers) can really help when weather flips.
	•	*“The* ***community vibe*** *is unreal – I wish I’d known how friendly and fun it was; I would have soaked it in more instead of stressing. From volunteers to fellow racers, everyone was awesome.”* – **Numerous riders** after their first Crusher. People often say they were worried and serious, but discovered it’s a supportive atmosphere. **Takeaway:** Yes it’s hard, but don’t forget to enjoy the camaraderie and views. High-five that aid station kid, thank the volunteers, and look around at the scenery – it actually can boost morale.
	•	*“I* ***should’ve brought a second Garmin battery or unit.*** *My GPS died at 7 hours and I lost my Strava file for the last climb – gutted! Lesson learned.”* – **One rider’s tech regret**. The long duration can outlast device battery if not fully charged or if you’re using navigation. **Takeaway:** Charge devices fully, maybe carry a small power bank if your bike computer/phone might die (especially for slower racers).
	•	*“I wore a* ***skin-suit thinking aero*** *– terrible idea when I had to pee in the woods and when the temps dropped. I wish I’d worn normal kit with pockets for layers.”* – **Racer who prioritized aero too much**. Crusher’s speeds aren’t that high (climbs are slow), and comfort/practicality trump aero marginal gains. **Takeaway:** Wear comfortable gear, have pockets for food/jacket – it’s not a flat road TT, it’s an adventure ride.

These “wish I knew” points basically reinforce key advice: **gear appropriately, pace smart, prep for altitude and weather, and savor the experience**.

A particularly poignant one from a female racer’s blog: *“I doubted if I would finish – that was new territory for me. I wish I had believed in myself a bit more from the start.”*  . She was very nervous but ultimately finished and realized she was stronger than she thought. **Takeaway:** Confidence and mental toughness are huge – don’t psych yourself out.

Finally, perhaps the most universal post-Crusher quote: *“That was the hardest thing I’ve ever done… and I can’t wait to do it again (now that I know what’s coming)!”* There’s a masochistic pride that comes with having done it, and many immediately think of how they’ll improve next time. Armed with all the above knowledge, a returning rider can avoid the pitfalls and have an even better (or less painful) performance.
