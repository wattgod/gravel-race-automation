# CRYSTAL BEAR — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**B&E's Trees [RECREATIONAL]:** "I received a phone call from Crystal Bear RD Chris Schotz the week of the race with news that their volunteer wouldn't be able to attend... Chris informed me I was no longer needed as a volunteer, and thus I was now obligated to race. WHAT!? I secretly wanted to ride, but coming from an MTB & off-road adventuring background I never really participated in long road/gravel events. 200 miles was intimidating to me." (https://www.embarkmaple.com/blog/crystal-bear-run-what-ya-brung-amp-make-up-the-rest)

**B&E's Trees [RECREATIONAL]:** "My goal was to finish Day 1, my first official century, but in true Embark spirit went over top and managed DFL!!" (https://www.embarkmaple.com/blog/crystal-bear-run-what-ya-brung-amp-make-up-the-rest)

**B&E's Trees [RECREATIONAL]:** "Drip. Drip. I woke on Day 2 to my rain fly soaked through and leaking on my forehead... When I woke up the thought of taking an 'easy route' back to Laona crossed my, damp doubtful mind... At that moment I had a bike and an able body, so the right decision was to just start pedaling."

**B&E's Trees [RECREATIONAL]:** "I just rode 200 miles, and I felt good. I wonder how far I can ride? Without the kind support & patient assistance in navigation (err, waiting for me at every turn) from Dustin, Shane & Laura, I would never have found my way along the race route, particularly on the first day."

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**[RECREATIONAL] - B&E's Trees:** "A few weeks earlier I had installed some old bar-ends on the inside of my brake levers to give me more hand & seating positions. Moving around in the saddle saved my back on my too-small bike with a seized too-low seat post... My back and knees had no complaints!" (https://www.embarkmaple.com/blog/crystal-bear-run-what-ya-brung-amp-make-up-the-rest)

**[RECREATIONAL] - Navigation Failures:** "I really like paper maps, but completely failed here. In hindsight, had I responsibly approached this race I would have *at least* used the USFS maps I unknowingly had stashed back in the van. A gazetteer has nowhere near the resolution required when riding forest service roads, truck trails & unmapped singletrack... Like many bikepacking routes, this one was best navigated by GPS for safety, speed & convenience." (https://www.embarkmaple.com/blog/crystal-bear-run-what-ya-brung-amp-make-up-the-rest)

## Weather Experienced

**2026 Race (Day 2):** "Drip. Drip. I woke on Day 2 to my rain fly soaked through and leaking on my forehead... Rain. Pedal. Sun. Pedal. Hail. Pedal. Repeat! The first 24 miles of the day developed a rhythm of non-committal weather patterns" (https://www.embarkmaple.com/blog/crystal-bear-run-what-ya-brung-amp-make-up-the-rest)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Nicolet National Forest Singletrack:** "The first 25 miles included a few miles of fun singletrack, complete with boulder rides! I love technical riding fully loaded, and this was one of the few sections of the course where I felt competent and 'at home,' just riding for fun!" (https://www.embarkmaple.com/blog/crystal-bear-run-what-ya-brung-amp-make-up-the-rest)

**Border Brule ATV Trail:** "One theme for seemingly the entire ride was the ridiculously beautiful trilliums in bloom. This was particularly stunning in the section after lunch riding an empty ATV trail through the Ottawa National Forest and up across the UP border (Brule River, aka Border Brule)." (https://www.embarkmaple.com/blog/crystal-bear-run-what-ya-brung-amp-make-up-the-rest)

**Gaastra to Crystal Falls:** "We rode a fun paved bike trail weaving through the small mining town of Gaastra to Iron River, and then left Iron River along the Heritage Trail. The sun was getting low for the last 25 miles of the day, with a final 14% grade climb before reaching Crystal Falls." (https://www.embarkmaple.com/blog/crystal-bear-run-what-ya-brung-amp-make-up-the-rest)

**Spread Eagle Barrens:** "I was struck by the stark contrasting beauty of Spread Eagle Barrens compared with the lush forests we were temporarily leaving behind. It's these moments of transition that take me away the most... this strange sandy landscape." (https://www.embarkmaple.com/blog/crystal-bear-run-what-ya-brung-amp-make-up-the-rest)

**Logging Area Climb (Day 2):** "One climb particularly stood out; a rutted, fairly steep muddy trail with snaking stands of water through an active logging area. I could see a clearing just beyond the first turn, and was determined not to get off and push. The moment I expected triumph, the curve revealed multiple more stages to be cleared... I managed to keep enough momentum and traction that I made it to the sprawling landing with logs stacked tall along the trail." (https://www.embarkmaple.com/blog/crystal-bear-run-what-ya-brung-amp-make-up-the-rest)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**[RECREATIONAL] - Breaking Down the Distance:** "I broke each day's ride down roughly into quarters, with the thought I can 'always' ride another 25 miles. Knowing we'd have the opportunity for a real lunch around mile 55 (Hwy 139 Roadhouse) helped ease my very real fear of hanger (recall I'm bad at feeding myself)." (https://www.embarkmaple.com/blog/crystal-bear-run-what-ya-brung-amp-make-up-the-rest)

**[RECREATIONAL] - Nutrition Strategy:** "I worked out a really good on-bike routine for myself. I would mix up a half pack of Elderberry Maple Energy Embark in an empty 16oz tea bottle and take a drink anytime I saw a climb, and another drink following the climb. If anything was feeling tight or tingly, I would also take a drink." (https://www.embarkmaple.com/blog/crystal-bear-run-what-ya-brung-amp-make-up-the-rest)

**[RECREATIONAL] - Day 2 Strategic Error:** "In an effort to make better time I decided not to join other racers for breakfast, and planned to not stop for lunch either. Not taking an opportunity to feed myself has never turned out well, but this time I had a zip-lock of last night's pizza packed in my frame bag so we're all good, eh?" (https://www.embarkmaple.com/blog/crystal-bear-run-what-ya-brung-amp-make-up-the-rest)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Race Format & Amenities:** "Includes: campground fee, tasty pizza and cold beer in Crystal Falls on Saturday night and breakfast buffet Sunday morning in Crystal Falls to fuel your ride back to Laona." (https://www.thebear100.com/crystal-bear)

**Race Philosophy:** "The Rules: Self-sufficiency, unsupported, no SAG" (https://www.thebear100.com/crystal-bear)

**Mid-Race Support:** "Shortly after getting back on the bikes we bid adieu. One climb particularly stood out... I managed to keep enough momentum and traction... I zoned out on the repetitive pedal stroke after pedal stroke before rolling into Armstrong Creek. I was in a daze as I stumbled into my riding friends from the day before as they were resting up for the final push back to Laona." (https://www.embarkmaple.com/blog/crystal-bear-run-what-ya-brung-amp-make-up-the-rest)

**RD Interaction:** "I received a phone call from Crystal Bear RD Chris Schotz the week of the race... I arrived in Laona Friday night and learned that Gary, whom I had met two weeks earlier at the Bear 100, volunteered to shuttle beer & coffee. Chris informed me I was no longer needed as a volunteer, and thus I was now obligated to race." (https://www.embarkmaple.com/blog/crystal-bear-run-what-ya-brung-amp-make-up-the-rest)
