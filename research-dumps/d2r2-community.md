# D2R2 — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Nat Talbot [ELITE]:** "D2R2 is the main benefit fundraiser for the Franklin Land Trust, a Western Mass based conservation non-profit based in Franklin County. The organized ride has around for almost 20 years officially (FLT says 2005), which almost definitely means it predates most organized 'gravel grinder' events (and maybe the term?)." (https://musings.nat-talbot.com/augusts-waning-days-d2r2-ride-report/)

**Nat Talbot [ELITE]:** "I felt awful for like the first two hours of this. I felt awful through breakfast, it was just nausea that I couldn't shake... Nutrition for these types of rides is a constant battle. I've beaten it a few times, but at a certain point it just feels like I can't get enough energy during and I crash. Strava/Wahoo thinks I burned like 5600 calories, which is a number I really doubt, but even if it was like, half that, I probably didn't get nearly enough to make that gap." (https://musings.nat-talbot.com/augusts-waning-days-d2r2-ride-report/)

**Nat Talbot [ELITE]:** "The ride to me is sort of a love letter to biking in New England, and really to the terrain of New England in general. I think what I was struck by most this year was how much you can feel the terrain around you as you ride – you're basically living the contour lines." (https://musings.nat-talbot.com/augusts-waning-days-d2r2-ride-report/)

**Cyclesnack blogger [RECREATIONAL]:** "What a hot day! I think this was the hottest day of riding Will and I have ever ridden at D2R2... By 10 AM it was starting to get hot and there wasn't a lot of shade... It was hot AF!" (https://www.cyclesnack.com/2022/08/2022-d2r2-115k-ride.html)

**Cyclesnack blogger [RECREATIONAL]:** "Pennel Hill was next and it is the Godzilla of climbs! I think what makes this climb so tough is coming off Rt 112 you are immediately faced with a 15% grade!" (https://www.cyclesnack.com/2022/08/2022-d2r2-115k-ride.html)

**Cyclesnack blogger [RECREATIONAL]:** "About three quarters of the way up [Patten Hill] I could feel a leg cramp coming on so I stopped and as soon as I swung my right leg over the bike it seized up. It would seize up two more times before I could walk again." (https://www.cyclesnack.com/2022/08/2022-d2r2-115k-ride.html)

**Matthew Vandivort [COMPETITIVE]:** "I was forced by time and equipment constraints to ride my Moots Routt RSL that is currently setup for road use. Meaning I was going to tackle the steep Western Massachusetts gradients with a 48T single chainring upfront... I lost the use of my 32-cog to an early mechanical. This left every single ascent on the course to be tackled at a leg grinding cadence of 45 rpm. In short, this ride hurt. A lot." (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/2019/8/d2r2-harder-than-i-expected-more-fun-than-i-imagined)

**Matthew Vandivort [COMPETITIVE]:** "D2R2 certainly fits this bill. From its pre-and-post ride festivities to its wide array of different distances for different riders and the fact that the entire event is held to benefit a great cause - it all adds up to something really special that doesn't exist in any USAC race that I have participated in over the past decade." (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/2019/8/d2r2-harder-than-i-expected-more-fun-than-i-imagined)

**Thesis Bike Blog rider [ELITE]:** "Aside from a single descent down a snowmobile trail that makes you feel like a ball in a pachinko machine, this was as rough as the 160k Mystery route got. The majority of each route is comprised of arrestingly beautiful dirt roads in their recently graded summer prime. Flecks of gravel show up around the periphery, but make no mistake, these roads are dirt." (https://thesis.bike/blogs/thesis-bike-blog/when-gravel-is-actually-just-dirt-road-riding-a-case-for-infinite-adjustability)

**Richard Pirro [UNKNOWN]:** "Epic would be an understatement. If you're looking to challenge yourself this is the event for you." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/richards-story-d2r2)

**Bill Arduser [UNKNOWN]:** "I am pretty sure the grade on Pennel Hill after the second switchback was 18% maybe more." (https://www.cyclesnack.com/2022/08/2022-d2r2-115k-ride.html)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**[ELITE] Nat Talbot's Setup (100K):**
- Bike: Trek Checkpoint ALR5 (2022)
- Wheels: DT Swiss CR1600 aluminum cyclocross wheelset
- Tires: Teravail Cannonball 42x700, tubeless
- Bags: Revelate Mag-Tank for food/multitool, Ortileb small saddle bag (spare tube, CO2, derailleur hanger, shifter cable, tubeless repair kit, valve cores, chain quicklinks)
- Water: Two bottles - Skratch electrolytes in one, plain water in the other
- Note: "I get sick of just electrolytes"
(https://musings.nat-talbot.com/augusts-waning-days-d2r2-ride-report/)

**[RECREATIONAL] Cyclesnack's Observations (115K):**
- One rider on a steel road bike with 34mm tanwall race tires
- Another on 38mm file tread tires
- Their friend Jason on a mountain bike had three flats during the ride
(https://www.cyclesnack.com/2022/08/2022-d2r2-115k-ride.html)

**[COMPETITIVE] Matthew Vandivort's Inadequate Setup:**
- Bike: Moots Routt RSL with 48T single chainring (road setup)
- Lost 32-cog early, left with 45rpm grinding cadence on climbs
- Verdict: "Poor choice of gear ratios" - nearly cracked on steep climbs
(https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/2019/8/d2r2-harder-than-i-expected-more-fun-than-i-imagined)

**[ELITE] Thesis Bike Setup (160K Mystery Route):**
- Started on 40mm semi-knobby tires, felt "way over-biked"
- Adjusted geometry mid-ride: moved dropouts from ~435mm chainstay/71.7° headtube/84mm BB drop to ~425mm/72.2°/79mm BB drop
- Result: "Less wandering in the front wheel while grinding out climbs, more precision while twisting through steep switchbacking descents"
- Context: Most roads are well-graded dirt, not technical gravel
(https://thesis.bike/blogs/thesis-bike-blog/when-gravel-is-actually-just-dirt-road-riding-a-case-for-infinite-adjustability)

**Tire Width Consensus:**
- [ELITE]: 40-42mm works well but may be overkill for graded dirt roads
- [RECREATIONAL]: 34-38mm seen on the course, though mountain bike tires suffered multiple flats
- Surface is primarily hard-packed dirt, not loose gravel

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**100K Route Climbing Pattern [ELITE perspective]:**
"You burn through like 2000 feet of climbing in the first 13 miles (for reference, I consider any route with 100+ feet/mile of climbing hard), hit the first rest stop, refuel, and then do some rolling climbs until you hit a pretty decent reprieve, which is a paved descent into Colrain, MA, where you're at like a -10% grade for a half mile, which feels seriously steep." (https://musings.nat-talbot.com/augusts-waning-days-d2r2-ride-report/)

**Key 100K Sections:**
- "You then roll onto the state highway for a few miles, which follows the valley of the North River, before taking a right turn onto a really quiet road, where you switchback up another 2000 feet of climbing and cross into Vermont."
- "Once you hit the top, you're at the highest point of the ride, and you get a really long extended downhill to lunch at the Green River Covered Bridge."
- "The rest of the day is a really, really nice extended downhill on Green River Road, which is so nice that they have a separate route option that's just that road."
- "You then get whacked by a good deal climbing out of the river valley, as you've still got 2000 feet to go, and a particularly silly sustained 10% paved climb up to Apex Orchards"
(https://musings.nat-talbot.com/augusts-waning-days-d2r2-ride-report/)

**115K Specific Terrain [RECREATIONAL perspective]:**
- "The first big climb of the ride was River Road... The dirt road turned into a Jeep Road and proceeded to get more rugged by each passing mile... Nearly five miles of jeep road that while rough was pretty challenging with rocks and roots"
- "The second big climb of the ride was Ames Hill. Ames Hill is a long grind"
- Green River Road: "really shady and kind of flat but just enough grade to keep your speed up without having to expend a lot of energy"
- Stage Road: "nearly a 5 mile grind"
- Pennel Hill: "immediately faced with a 15% grade... Early into the climb there is a snakey section that was all washboarded out"
- Patten Hill: "The really steep section is at the beginning and its paved but it's still hard as hell"
(https://www.cyclesnack.com/2022/08/2022-d2r2-115k-ride.html)

**115K Climbing Stats:**
"The course had three new climbs for us, River Rd, Stage Road, and Pennel Hill, which to me has to be the hardest climb in the area." Total elevation roughly ~65 miles/6,500 feet with "4,400 feet in the first 34 miles"
(https://www.cyclesnack.com/2022/08/2022-d2r2-115k-ride.html)

**160K Mystery Route:**
"96 miles and nearly 11,000 feet of climbing... what the farm roads of Western Mass lack in technical terrain they make up in sweeping high speed descents (and heavy climbs to reach them)"
(https://thesis.bike/blogs/thesis-bike-blog/when-gravel-is-actually-just-dirt-road-riding-a-case-for-infinite-adjustability)

**180K Route:**
Described as "insane" with 14,000 feet of climbing
(https://musings.nat-talbot.com/augusts-waning-days-d2r2-ride-report/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**[ELITE] Nutrition Strategy - Nat Talbot (100K):**
- Food: Nature's Bakery Fig Newtons, 1x Maurten Gel 100 (uneaten), SIS gels, Untapped waffles, Untapped maple syrup packets
- Key learning: "If you eat too much of one thing you feel weird. Stay on the bike long enough and real food feels fake... The syrup was basically all I could handle by the end (it tastes normal, my body understands it as food)"
- Estimated burn: ~5,600 calories per Strava/Wahoo (rider doubts accuracy, estimates possibly half that)
- Result: Still ran calorie deficit, felt awful first two hours
(https://musings.nat-talbot.com/augusts-waning-days-d2r2-ride-report/)

**[RECREATIONAL] Nutrition Strategy - Cyclesnack (115K):**
- Pre-ride: "Karl's Sausage Kitchen Team rolled out around 7 AM"
- Lunch at Covered Bridge: "Peanut Butter and Jelly, with Fluffernutter and Nutella sandwich, pasta salad, bag of chips and an ice cold coke"
- Emergency tactics: Broke out flask for extra energy on final climbs
- Snacks carried: "Wandrer miles" suggests tracking app, brought pickle juice for cramping
- At final rest stop: "pickle juice and plenty of water but what I really wanted was an ice cold Coca Cola... stuffed my face with bananas, watermelon and sugary snacks for the last 8 miles"
(https://www.cyclesnack.com/2022/08/2022-d2r2-115k-ride.html)

**[RECREATIONAL] Pacing Lessons:**
"It's a good thing we left early because we got to lunch early and from what I heard by noon the lunch stop at the Covered Bridge was fairly picked over."
"Getting here early was the trick. I think it was on one of the last Mystery Rides prior to the Pandemic the lunch stop was here and there was a huge line"
(https://www.cyclesnack.com/2022/08/2022-d2r2-115k-ride.html)

**[ELITE] Pacing Strategy:**
"The one benefit of feeling this terrible for the first 13+ miles was that I paced myself really reasonably for most of the climbing. By the final kicker of climbing, my legs were smoked, but I was able to go up to Apex and back home without walking the bike or stopping to rest."
(https://musings.nat-talbot.com/augusts-waning-days-d2r2-ride-report/)

**[COMPETITIVE] Key Insight:**
"Despite those warnings, the first few miles were flat and mostly paved, giving a sense of foreboding as we realized that all of the elevation must be packed into the final 100km."
(https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/2019/8/d2r2-harder-than-i-expected-more-fun-than-i-imagined)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Cramping [RECREATIONAL]:**
"About three quarters of the way up [Patten Hill] I could feel a leg cramp coming on so I stopped and as soon as I swung my right leg over the bike it seized up. It would seize up two more times before I could walk again... I could feel my leg muscles start to grab which is a sure sign that I am about to cramp"
- Solution: Stopped to stretch, ate salted licorice
(https://www.cyclesnack.com/2022/08/2022-d2r2-115k-ride.html)

**Mechanicals:**
- [RECREATIONAL] Jason had "his third flat already" partway through the 115K route on a mountain bike
- [COMPETITIVE] "I missed the turn onto Barrows Road, and just kept climbing Ames Hill"
(https://www.cyclesnack.com/2022/08/2022-d2r2-115k-ride.html)

**Inadequate Gearing [COMPETITIVE]:**
"This latter climb [up to final rest stop] was when I nearly cracked - it was steep enough that with my gearing I had to put a foot down more than once."
(https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/2019/8/d2r2-harder-than-i-expected-more-fun-than-i-imagined)

**Heat and Nutrition [RECREATIONAL]:**
"By 10 AM it was starting to get hot and there wasn't a lot of shade... Garmin Climb Pro added a new color to the screen, an orangish red, almost a pink, or maybe it was the light and my delirium affecting my eyes because it was so hot!"
(https://www.cyclesnack.com/2022/08/2022-d2r2-115k-ride.html)

**Previous DNF Experience [RECREATIONAL]:**
"This was my first year actually finishing the 100k! I tried 3x before and either didn't have the fitness (2x) or mechanicals (1x)."
(https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/15vtdwz/anyone_else_ride_d2r2_today/)

**Heat Impact on Slower Riders [UNKNOWN]:**
"D2R2 newbie here -- signed up for the 160k but a total lack of training (and I'll blame the heat, also) meant I was totally cooked by the Covered Bridge stop. During a slug of pickle juice I formulated my survival plan... Enjoy a FULL (full!) lunch, then find a 100k'er to latc[h on]"
(https://www.cyclesnack.com/2022/08/2022-d2r2-115k-ride.html)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Event Philosophy:**
"D2R2 will never offer prizes for anything other than gags, nor will finish results ever be presented like it was a race. The course is not marked. Riders will use cue sheets to navigate the route... Riders shall cover the course in a self-sufficient manner, without motorized crew vehicles."
(https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/2019/8/d2r2-harder-than-i-expected-more-fun-than-i-imagined)

**Camping Experience:**
"A significant number of participants camp on site the night before (though the odd decision to put tents in between each car means that if you have a neighbor starting early you can expect to hear them pumping their tires at 5AM — ugh)."
(https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/2019/8/d2r2-harder-than-i-expected-more-fun-than-i-imagined)

**Relaxed Vibe [COMPETITIVE perspective]:**
"The D2R2 vibe is distinctly more relaxed than at your typical road race or even an event like Rasputitsa where the hardcore racers (and former cyclocross world champions) come out in force. Instead, D2R2 is a communal affair."
"The 'not a race' philosophy of D2R2 meant that we could casually begin the ride well after our scheduled start."
(https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/2019/8/d2r2-harder-than-i-expected-more-fun-than-i-imagined)

**Post-Ride:**
"We rolled across the start/finish line to partake in the free beers and post-ride food"
"After dinner Will and I rode back to the camp and I had to have another cold one! I had a pretty good dirt tan, too. Todd Powers and I rode over to the Deerfield River and cooled off, too. That felt so good!"
(https://www.cyclesnack.com/2022/08/2022-d2r2-115k-ride.html)

**Social Riding:**
"Along the way we met up with Jason Reagan and rode with him till the first water stop"
"Joe joined us from here on out" [referring to Joe Bamberg from New Jersey]
(https://www.cyclesnack.com/2022/08/2022-d2r2-115k-ride.html)

**Comparison to Competitive Events:**
"Categorized races are the outliers. We who strive to make Cat 2 are the weird ones. Isn't it enough that you can go ride in a new environment, see some amazing scenery, and challenge yourself physically, mentally, and if we're honest, emotionally? D2R2 certainly fits this bill."
(https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/2019/8/d2r2-harder-than-i-expected-more-fun-than-i-imagined)

**Fundraising Purpose:**
"D2R2 is a key fundraiser for the Franklin Land Trust's efforts to conserve land in the region. Making up 1/3 of the Franklin Country Land Trust's annual fundraising, D2R2 helps to keep what would likely otherwise be ski condos as conserved forest, wetland, open space, and farmland."
(https://thesis.bike/blogs/thesis-bike-blog/when-gravel-is-actually-just-dirt-road-riding-a-case-for-infinite-adjustability)

**Local Memorial Encounter [RECREATIONAL]:**
"As I was turning onto Green River Road I noticed this big event and I wondered if it was a tractor pull or something. I asked a guy as he was leaving and he said it was a memorial for beloved West Guilford man, Billy Fitzpatrick who recently died of cancer. The whole town must have been present."
(https://www.cyclesnack.com/2022/08/2022-d2r2-115k-ride.html)
