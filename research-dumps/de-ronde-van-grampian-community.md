# DE RONDE VAN GRAMPIAN — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**c0nsumer [RECREATIONAL]:** "Today was their first race, and it was excellent. They had a great start/finish venue, just the right amount of wide, but non-travel trails through Bald Mountain North and Upland Hills School. Marking was good, the route choice was basically a whats-what of fast & fun local roads, and I don't think there was any pavement at all in either the 25 or 50 route. I'm really looking forward to next year. This is a new race, for sure, but the racer experience and quality was up there with the likes of BRX: solid and well executed on a really great route."

**Michael Green [UNKNOWN]:** "The goal was to not get carried away and blow up on the first, decisive climb on Barr Road. The race started on two track at Upland Hills farm, out onto a narrow gravel road and the shenanigans started as everyone fought for position. I played it calmly and awaited Barr Road which came up promptly. Sure enough, the fireworks started and I missed that split... Coming into the final segment, I was sitting a little further back that I'd hoped. We were perhaps fifteen strong by now and it came up a little sooner than I'd expected - the pace coming into the singletrack was high. As everyone swung wide to enter perpendicular to the trail, I made the most of my tires and cut hard, moving up rapidly and eventually third wheel... That's was enough to win our group, which I was happy with, win my age group and cracked the top 30." (https://www.bikeman.com/blog/de-ronde-van-grampian.htms)

**Jason D [ELITE]:** "2:54 for the race. 213W. HR 169... My goal going in was under 3 hours, which I figured was doable because I can do a couple hours at 15+ MPH by myself on the fat bike. I really wanted 17 MPH and thought maybe a stretch was 18 MPH, but the course is a bit hillier than I usually do and the last 1.5 miles or so is on trails and even with the fat bike I knew would be slow. I think I was 17.8 through 38-40 miles at least and slowed toward the end, but was still 17+." (https://fastrunningblog.com/u/jasondodge/blog-De-Ronde-van-Grampian/07-22-2023.html)

**redmosquito1983 [ELITE]:** "I have signed up for several gravel races this year, Barry-Roubaix, De Ronde Van Grampian, and Iceman so far, so I want to increase competitiveness too. I love marginal gains, and seems carbon wheels are the a great way to maximize that... I'm am a heavy rider mostly riding to lose weight; down 50lbs, but still have 30+ to go."

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Michael Green [UNKNOWN]:** "I'd chosen to ride with higher volume 2.1 MTB tires on my gravel bike knowing that the final mile and a half was fast singletrack and a tight uphill climb. I was really happy with how they rolled on the gravel and helped me feel really comfortable on the corners... Bike was awesome, I loved the confidence my tire choice gave me." (https://www.bikeman.com/blog/de-ronde-van-grampian.htms)

**Jason D [ELITE]:** Rode a fat bike for the 50-mile course, noting "Unsure how fast I would have been on my gravel bike. Some of the corners were tricky on some downhills." (https://fastrunningblog.com/u/jasondodge/blog-De-Ronde-van-Grampian/07-22-2023.html)

**Jason D [ELITE]:** "Neutral roll out through there and down Indian Lake as it was pretty rough, but it always is... the course is a bit hillier than I usually do and the last 1.5 miles or so is on trails... there was one sketchy section with a washout that was terrible but unexpected given that the rest of the course was in really good shape." (https://fastrunningblog.com/u/jasondodge/blog-De-Ronde-van-Grampian/07-22-2023.html)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Michael Green [UNKNOWN]:** "The goal was to not get carried away and blow up on the first, decisive climb on Barr Road... I wasn't prepared to go deep so early at this point of the season not wanted to be one of the inevitable racers who'll blow out the back sooner or later. Group two on the road formed, maybe 10 or so of us and would expand slowly as the group ahead surged and hammered the rolling hills. Our group was strong, we had some known guys in the group and there were the typical games." Strategy included positioning for the final singletrack: "As everyone swung wide to enter perpendicular to the trail, I made the most of my tires and cut hard, moving up rapidly." (https://www.bikeman.com/blog/de-ronde-van-grampian.htms)

**Jason D [ELITE]:** Power and speed data for 50-mile course: "213W average, HR 169, 17+ MPH average speed, 2:54 finish time. I was 17.8 MPH through 38-40 miles at least and slowed toward the end." On race start: "My HR was up a bit mostly from race nerves... Neutral roll out... That actually ended up not being super neutral, but I appreciated the safety concern. Formed a decent group eventually and I was able to work with a group for quite a long time and really enjoyed racing."

**Jason D [ELITE]:** "Cool morning to start... Got there at a decent time and ran into a bunch of people I know, a few I haven't seen in a while. It was really nice to see people. The corral was pretty packed and the bike is not small, so I felt a little clausterphobic, but settle in okay with a slow start at the farm. A few people ate it in the sand... Stayed for awards and had some food and then road home. Absolutely perfect weather day and I had a lot of fun racing and riding bikes."

It does contain the areas highest peak and used to be home to a ski resort, but that went out of business a long time ago."
