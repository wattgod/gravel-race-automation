# DEAD SWEDE GRAVEL — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Heidi [ELITE]:** "2nd place overall women, 2nd place 30-49 women, 13th place overall out of 330 or so racers. 2 hours and 26 minutes... It's been a long time, or even never, since I have been this proud of my race effort and finish. I raced smart in the opening pavement miles, hiding in the pack. I railed the descents, and made sure to stay steady on the climbs. I put forth a solo time trial effort over most of the course, much of it into a hot headwind all by myself." (https://heidiridesbikes.com/2019/06/09/race-report-the-dead-swede/) — 40 mile distance in 2019

**Heidi [ELITE]:** "Never. Again. Never... 96.7 miles, 9668 feet of climbing, 7 hours 51 minutes. 5th place overall women... I immediately started crying and yanked the Shimano gravel shoes off my feet and threw them down before I was out of the little finishing corral. Then I laid down and cried some more." (https://heidiridesbikes.com/2021/06/06/race-report-2021-dead-swede-hundo/) — 100 mile distance in 2021

**Heidi [ELITE]:** "on three separate occasions I cried while pedaling because my feet hurt so bad. I ended up loosening my shoes all the way up and pedaled like that for ten miles or so (can't say it really helped). By now it was solidly in the 90s and the last 46 miles of the course would be in full Wyoming sunshine." (https://heidiridesbikes.com/2021/06/06/race-report-2021-dead-swede-hundo/)

**Jeffrey Cory [ELITE]:** "First pee of the race that I could muster, and a bit concerning I wasn't making much urine; but in the second half of the race, for whatever reason, that problem went away, which I figured was a good sign... 103 miles; 6516 feet elevation gain; 8 hrs 45 minutes total race time; 7 hours 45 minutes total ride time... finished 64th out of 65 finishers of the hundo... NP was in my Tempo zone, well, well below my FTP." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/jeffreys-story-dead-swede-2022)

**Jeffrey Cory [ELITE]:** "a black truck ('race support,' aka, Dead Swede sag wagon, aka, the one who makes you get in for a ride home when you don't make the time cutoffs) literally, and I mean literally, followed me (I'll give him credit — at a distance of maybe 100 yards) the entirety of the course (till about 10 miles from the finish)." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/jeffreys-story-dead-swede-2022)

**Anonymous rider [UNKNOWN]:** "After crossing the finish line, racers were greeted by cheering crowds, a band in the amphitheater, and the smell of delicious barbecue." (https://2wheeledinspiration.com/2024/06/19/the-dead-swede-a-race-review/)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Heidi [ELITE]:** "all done on a 2012 Specialized Crux with canti brakes and relatively narrow tires in comparison to today's trends, and hamburger seat bag. I thumb my nose at you, industry marketing tactics!" — 40 mile distance, 43mph descents on 32mm tires (https://heidiridesbikes.com/2019/06/09/race-report-the-dead-swede/)

**Heidi [ELITE]:** "I learned I was probably beyond the capabilities of my brakes a good chunk of the time on the eroded, rutted, sandy forest road downhills of death... My hands would seize up and I'd take a quick moment every so often to shake out one hand" — regarding 100 mile course with Red Grade descent (https://heidiridesbikes.com/2021/06/06/race-report-2021-dead-swede-hundo/)

**Heidi [ELITE]:** "my silly carbon soled 'gravel' shoes rubbed blisters in my heels" on Red Grade climb. Later: "I immediately started crying and yanked the Shimano gravel shoes off my feet and threw them down" (https://heidiridesbikes.com/2021/06/06/race-report-2021-dead-swede-hundo/)

**Jeffrey Cory [ELITE]:** "Lauf True Grit bike was awesome. One numb/tingly pinky finger post-race is nearly all better now, some 24+ hours later... No mechanicals, no flats, AXS battery didn't run out." Also used "Chamois Butter" and brought "one of those little single-use CB thingies to reapply a couple times mid-race." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/jeffreys-story-dead-swede-2022)

## Weather Experienced

**2019 (40 mile):** "The still air combined with my black skin suit and hot sun made me want to melt" — Heidi [ELITE] (https://heidiridesbikes.com/2019/06/09/race-report-the-dead-swede/)

**2021 (100 mile):** "It was setting up to be a hot one (in the 90s)... By now it was solidly in the 90s and the last 46 miles of the course would be in full Wyoming sunshine. Oh, and no wind because hey, we didn't need wind in Wyoming on this day..." — Heidi [ELITE]. Also noted: "may I point out Sunday's high was projected to be 79" (https://heidiridesbikes.com/2021/06/06/race-report-2021-dead-swede-hundo/)

**2022 (100 mile):** "Weather was amazing. Low 50s to start, mid 70s in afternoon. No T-storms developed till evening. Hardly any wind, head or tail." — Jeffrey Cory [ELITE]. He also notes: "Memorial Day got 2.5 inches of rain (yep, 7th highest single-day total there, on record — ever, like, in recorded history) thus putting wet heavy snow up in the Big Horn mountains, that single track course portion had to be scratched." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/jeffreys-story-dead-swede-2022)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**40 Mile Course:**
- **Heidi [ELITE]:** "8 miles of pavement to get us warmed up... After eight miles we hit the gravel and immediately the first big climb of the day." Then "Super, crazy fast descents... long grindy uphills... The next gravel road was rolly, falsely flat, had a mild headwind, and was hot." Final stretch: "The last handful of miles on the pavement sucked." (https://heidiridesbikes.com/2019/06/09/race-report-the-dead-swede/)

**100 Mile Course — Red Grade:**
- **Heidi [ELITE]:** "Oh Red Grade… the stupid hill/mountain/death march you are. Steep paved grind, even steeper gravel BS until the singletrack trails which are suppose to be a reprieve, but aside from shade I think I said a cuss word at every switchback. Then it was time for more stupid gravel BS, culminating at a point I was walking my bike with about ten others... Once you're to the 'top,' it really doesn't stop with continuous up and down terrain." (https://heidiridesbikes.com/2021/06/06/race-report-2021-dead-swede-hundo/)

- **Heidi [ELITE]:** "the descents started, and I learned I was probably beyond the capabilities of my brakes a good chunk of the time on the eroded, rutted, sandy forest road downhills of death... Throw in a Land Rover Defender climbing one of the narrow two tracks... knee deep creek crossing, where I took the chance to pop my feet out of my shoes for a quick massage before hiking my bike up a sandbox of a hill." (https://heidiridesbikes.com/2021/06/06/race-report-2021-dead-swede-hundo/)

- **Jeffrey Cory [ELITE]:** "The picture of the 'can we still be friends' sign is from the steepest hill, near the top. I'd say it was 9-12% max grade for about a quarter mile." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/jeffreys-story-dead-swede-2022)

**Course Markings:**
- **Anonymous [UNKNOWN]:** "Overall, it was a very well marked course" (https://2wheeledinspiration.com/2024/06/19/the-dead-swede-a-race-review/)

**Climbing:**
- **Heidi [ELITE]:** "the course has nearly 10,000 feet of climbing" for 100 mile (https://heidiridesbikes.com/2021/06/06/race-report-2021-dead-swede-hundo/)
- **Jeffrey Cory [ELITE]:** "6516 feet elevation gain" for 103 miles (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/jeffreys-story-dead-swede-2022)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Start Tactics:**

**Heidi [ELITE]:** "I hate mass starts, and I hate them even more in a crowd mostly filled with people that have never road raced or ridden in a peloton. The incredibly short neutral roll out took place, and then bam! 8 miles of pavement to get us warmed up... I raced smart in the opening pavement miles, hiding in the pack." — 40 mile, ~2:26 finish (https://heidiridesbikes.com/2019/06/09/race-report-the-dead-swede/)

**Heidi [ELITE]:** "The first stretch of pavement miles were okay and chill, but I popped off the lead group on the second gravel hill after I saw 400 watts and realized I could not sustained. Mile 9 and I was already disheartened... I kind of kicked myself for not riding my own race and trying to stay with that group" — 100 mile attempt (https://heidiridesbikes.com/2021/06/06/race-report-2021-dead-swede-hundo/)

**Pacing Data:**

**Jeffrey Cory [ELITE]:** "485 TSS; HR zone percentages — Z2 AE 32%; Z3 Tempo 52%; Z4 Threshold 15%... NP was in my Tempo zone, well, well below my FTP... 12.5mph average speed" — 7:45 ride time for 103 miles (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/jeffreys-story-dead-swede-2022)

**Heidi [ELITE]:** "I ignored the goose bumps on my legs, and the wonky feeling in my stomach and just tried to pedal as hard as I could at 120 watts. Total wattage cottage happening this day" — final 10 miles of 100 miler in extreme heat (https://heidiridesbikes.com/2021/06/06/race-report-2021-dead-swede-hundo/)

**Nutrition:**

**Heidi [ELITE]:** "Around hour one I started sipping my Tailwind, cognizant of the fact I needed to be taking on the calories and hydration in the sun." — 40 mile (https://heidiridesbikes.com/2019/06/09/race-report-the-dead-swede/)

**Heidi [ELITE]:** "7 SIS gels, 1 Uncrustable, 2 child size packets of gummy fruit snacks, 24oz bottle of orange Tailwind Endurance Fuel, 12oz Nunn sport mix, 8 Endurolyte tablets, 12oz of Gatorade" — 100 mile, 7:51 finish (https://heidiridesbikes.com/2021/06/06/race-report-2021-dead-swede-hundo/)

**Jeffrey Cory [ELITE]:** "Some calories by Tailwind in my large bottle; drinking calories can be easier than eating them, sometimes... handful of Swedish fish... couple shots of pickle juice for the cramps." — 100 mile, 7:45 ride time (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/jeffreys-story-dead-swede-2022)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Heat-Related Issues:**

**Heidi [ELITE]:** "if there is one thing that is my kryptonite, it is heat... Twenty degrees cooler and I would've had a much different race I think" — 90+ degree temps on 100 mile (https://heidiridesbikes.com/2021/06/06/race-report-2021-dead-swede-hundo/)

**Heidi [ELITE]:** "The stretch from Dayton to the 'bacon station' is always the worse part of the course, and as I was catching 40/60 milers, I could tell a lot of people were in a bad way in the heat – waiting for rides, getting picked up, calling people, just walking. I debated jumping into an irrigation ditch or the river when I'd see it" (https://heidiridesbikes.com/2021/06/06/race-report-2021-dead-swede-hundo/)

**Foot Pain:**

**Heidi [ELITE]:** "Soon the foot pain increased, and on three separate occasions I cried while pedaling because my feet hurt so bad. I ended up loosening my shoes all the way up and pedaled like that for ten miles or so" (https://heidiridesbikes.com/2021/06/06/race-report-2021-dead-swede-hundo/)

**Hydration:**

**Jeffrey Cory [ELITE]:** "First pee of the race that I could muster, and a bit concerning I wasn't making much urine" at mile 49. Also noted his camelback was refilled at an aid station but "the aid station volunteer didn't really like fill it up at all" (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/jeffreys-story-dead-swede-2022)

**Time Cutoffs:**

**Jeffrey Cory [ELITE]:** Describes being followed by sag wagon "the entirety of the course (till about 10 miles from the finish)" and notes "About 1.5 hours before the DNF cutoff at that station" at the bacon aid station, mile 90 (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/jeffreys-story-dead-swede-2022)

**Course Conditions:**

**Weather cancellation note:** In 2022, Memorial Day brought 2.5 inches of rain putting "wet heavy snow up in the Big Horn mountains, that single track course portion had to be scratched" (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/jeffreys-story-dead-swede-2022)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Aid Stations:**

**Jeffrey Cory [ELITE]:** "Fun socializing with aid station volunteers, anyway. Definitely topped up my 3 water bottles at all station stops... The volunteers pepped me up... when they realized I was the lanterne rouge, they got all whoop-y and jumpy and said they'd see me again on my second loop, and get back out there and get 'er done!" (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/jeffreys-story-dead-swede-2022)

**Heidi [ELITE]:** "I blew past" the beer and bacon aid station (40 mile). For 100 mile: "The vols (who, bless their patience, could finally pack up after these last two slow-ass 100-mile racers got on through) were super supportive, all cheers and cowbells and offers to feed me. They had lots of PBR left, and did in fact suggest I should have a beer." (https://heidiridesbikes.com/2021/06/06/race-report-2021-dead-swede-hundo/)

**Anonymous [UNKNOWN]:** "aid stations were positioned about every 10-12 miles or so. The second aid station offered pickle juice shots, and the third aid station offered bacon and PBR." (https://2wheeledinspiration.com/2024/06/19/the-dead-swede-a-race-review/)

**Finish Line:**

**Heidi [ELITE]:** "Beer at the finish line!!" (40 mile) (https://heidiridesbikes.com/2019/06/09/race-report-the-dead-swede/)

**Jeffrey Cory [ELITE]:** "I went under the finish banner just as they were getting the afternoon podium awards going. Kind of ironic. Or something... Yeah, the free race beer at the finish party tasted pretty good." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/jeffreys-story-dead-swede-2022)

**Anonymous [UNKNOWN]:** "After crossing the finish line, racers were greeted by cheering crowds, a band in the amphitheater, and the smell of delicious barbecue." (https://2wheeledinspiration.com/2024/06/19/the-dead-swede-a-race-review/)

**Women's Field:**

**Heidi [ELITE]:** "And in events like the Dead Swede, it has crazy huge women's fields!" — 40 mile in 2019 (https://heidiridesbikes.com/2019/06/09/race-report-the-dead-swede/)

**Car Support Policy:**

**Anonymous [UNKNOWN]:** "The organizers clearly communicated that cars shouldn't be on the course providing services to riders – that's what the aid stations were for. This was for rider safety, and to minimize the dust in the air. I thought this was brilliant and would love for other gravel events to take a similar stance. Of course there was a car here and there, but they didn't kick up the dust like I have typically experienced when riding on a gravel road." (https://2wheeledinspiration.com/2024/06/19/the-dead-swede-a-race-review/)

**Scenic Beauty:**

**Jeffrey Cory [ELITE]:** "my passion is bikepacking, and many of those long miles are solo, so the beautiful landscape (see pics) and sky kept me company." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/jeffreys-story-dead-swede-2022)

**Organization:**

**Anonymous [UNKNOWN]:** "Overall, it was a very well marked course, communications were optimized, and the process from registration to packet pickup to post meal collection was seamless. Registration fees included a very cool Dead Swede t-shirts, sticker, and pint glass. I highly recommend this event!" (https://2wheeledinspiration.com/2024/06/19/the-dead-swede-a-race-review/)
