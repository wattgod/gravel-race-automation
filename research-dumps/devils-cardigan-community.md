# DEVILS CARDIGAN — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Scott Mattern [ELITE]:** "The Devil's Cardigan route design encompasses two day-ride courses: the shorter 50km route, or the 100km route... I decided to combine both the 50km and 100km loop for an attempt on what I was dubbing the 150km XL Cardigan. As it was technically unsanctioned, I would have to start early and alone in order to align my attempt on the two laps with the timing of the existing longer race, which commenced at 8 a.m." (https://theradavist.com/australian-gravel-national-championships)

**Scott Mattern [ELITE]:** "The early morning was cool but not cold by Tasmanian standards, with a thick fog blanketing my surroundings. The bicycle and I cut a lone figure in the dark of the pre-dawn hours... The lights that I had so carefully chosen to illuminate my path during the first lap were refracted by the fog, and hindered rather than helped my visibility." (https://theradavist.com/australian-gravel-national-championships)

**Scott Mattern [ELITE]:** "The previous days of heavy rain left its mark on the single-track portion of the route and turned it into one steady trickling creek. What should have been a highlight became a challenging and gritty grind." (https://theradavist.com/australian-gravel-national-championships)

**Tiffany Cromwell [ELITE]:** "Big congrats to Talia Appleton on the win. Strong ride and was pushing me a lot when we were together." (https://burgh.cc/gravel-goes-global-the-devils-cardigans-uci-debut-in-derby-tasmania/)

**Justin Morris [ELITE]:** "Despite freezing temps, driving sleet and erratic downpours all mud soaked riders crossed the finish line with a smile from ear to ear. Friends made from out on course and a course that although incredibly demanding really showed off some parts of Tasmania many would not have thought existed. It was a genuine feeling of achieving something 'epic' finishing this race." (https://marathonmtb.com/2021/07/04/the-devils-cardigan-gravel-race-sets-the-scene-in-tasmania-with-epic-course-and-conditions/)

**Max Hobson [ELITE]:** "Anyone who's been a regular at these events over the last few years will know all about the frosty early morning temps on the startline and the need to do an extra lap or two to warm up and prepare really well. You won't get away with a flimsy Queensland winter jersey at this place!" (https://www.ambmag.com.au/feature/2024-devils-cardigan-gravel-national-609264/)

**Max Hobson [ELITE]:** "So a Little Rivers 'Devils Cardigan' beer was just the thing to revive the tired bodies. Never had a beer tasted so bloody good. With the races all done for another year... Branxhom was jam-packed with riders telling their mates about what happened, like stories of flat tyres, aching sore bodies, lost water bottles and nasty pinchy climbs that lasted forever." (https://www.ambmag.com.au/feature/2024-devils-cardigan-gravel-national-609264/)

**Justine Barrow [ELITE] - 2024 Women's Elite Race:** "Justine felt motivated to set a high tempo on Ralph Falls but was unable to detach the two rivals in the first part of the climb. A couple of men's elite groups passed the three women, giving Justine and Courtney the opportunity to jump on for part of the climb." (https://www.ambmag.com.au/feature/2024-devils-cardigan-gravel-national-609264/)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Mountain Bikes vs Gravel Bikes [ELITE level observation]:** "Although achievable on a gravel bike, MTB's were not out of place at The Devil's Cardigan... Much of the podiums were taken by riders on mountain bikes. Although completely achievable on a gravel bike, some sections offered some more speed for mountain bikes. Also, perhaps the strongest riders in the field were on mountain bikes!" (https://marathonmtb.com/2021/07/04/the-devils-cardigan-gravel-race-sets-the-scene-in-tasmania-with-epic-course-and-conditions/)

**Nicole Frain [ELITE] - 2021:** "Convinced at the last minute with a borrowed mountain bike, Nicole crossed the line within the top 10 of our long course finishers." (https://www.devilscardigan.com.au/race-reports)

**Lighting Equipment [ELITE - for early starts]:** Scott Mattern's experience: "The lights that I had so carefully chosen to illuminate my path during the first lap were refracted by the fog, and hindered rather than helped my visibility." - suggesting that fog conditions make light choice critical for early morning starts. (https://theradavist.com/australian-gravel-national-championships)

**Tire/Equipment Durability [ELITE level]:** Multiple punctures reported on rough terrain: "Cassia Boglio punctured on the rough rocky terrain" during 2024 women's elite race. (https://www.ambmag.com.au/feature/2024-devils-cardigan-gravel-national-609264/)

**Mechanical Issues [ELITE]:** "Alex Lack... sprinted for 3rd... later revealed he raced 90km of the course missing the upper jockey wheel from his rear mech!" (https://marathonmtb.com/2021/07/04/the-devils-cardigan-gravel-race-sets-the-scene-in-tasmania-with-epic-course-and-conditions/)

**Winter Clothing [ALL LEVELS]:** POC Sports provided hoodies to keep volunteers "warm and cosy" - indicating significant cold weather gear needs for this mid-winter event. (https://www.devilscardigan.com.au/2023-race-recap-1)

## Weather Experienced

**2021 Edition:** "Despite freezing temps, driving sleet and erratic downpours all mud soaked riders crossed the finish line... inclement conditions. Despite this 120 hardy souls lined up in Derby... Running an event in Tasmania at elevation in mid winter guarantees one thing for competitors: inclement conditions." Year one had "near-freezing conditions with bouts of rain and sleet-like scuds." (https://marathonmtb.com/2021/07/04/the-devils-cardigan-gravel-race-sets-the-scene-in-tasmania-with-epic-course-and-conditions/)

**2023 Edition:** "The weather forecast ahead of the race looked grim; rain fell in near biblical proportions. A 50km ride in these predicted conditions was looking rough, let alone the full 100km. Flowing rivers appeared across the course that had not been there the day before. As evening settled on the eve of the race, it looked like there might be a break in the weather. The rain eased, and the wind backed off." Previous year (2022) had "near gale-force winds." (https://theradavist.com/australian-gravel-national-championships)

**2024 Edition:** "This year was no different and there are plenty of photos to prove it (Enter: riders rugged up in cardys and beanies!)... it was icy cold with frost settling on the trees and heaps of mumbling from everyone about how cold it was. Derby looked like it had a thick blanket of fog thrown over it." However, "the gravel gods were smiling on everyone this year with no sign of the torrential rain that muddied the course in 2023, making it a record breaking super fast race." (https://www.ambmag.com.au/feature/2024-devils-cardigan-gravel-national-609264/)

**2025 Edition:** Race held May 10, 2025 - no specific weather details reported beyond typical Tasmania mid-winter conditions. (https://burgh.cc/gravel-goes-global-the-devils-cardigans-uci-debut-in-derby-tasmania/)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Course Composition:** "106km course was as brutal as it was beautiful – 87% gravel, 2,300m of climbing, and three major climbs that left legs screaming and hearts full." (https://burgh.cc/gravel-goes-global-the-devils-cardigans-uci-debut-in-derby-tasmania/)

**Gravel Quality:** "The gravel isn't what riders would normally call 'champagne gravel' which is usually smooth 'road like' gravel. The gravel found in Derby is more like a rocky mountain bike trail in most parts." (https://www.ambmag.com.au/feature/2024-devils-cardigan-gravel-national-609264/)

**Course Mix:** "A healthy mix rough fire trails, logging roads, public dirt roads and country sealed 'dead' roads. The course accumulates close to 2500m of climbing for the 100km course meaning the course was physically, mentally and technically challenging." (https://marathonmtb.com/2021/07/04/the-devils-cardigan-gravel-race-sets-the-scene-in-tasmania-with-epic-course-and-conditions/)

**Specific Sections - 2024 Elite Race:**
- "Mutual Valley" - first major climb where the women's elite field of 13 dwindled to four
- "Dead Horse Hill Descent" - first major descent, "a pivotal point of the race because it was where the remaining elite men's field became strung out forming several smaller groups"
- "Ralph Falls Climb" - approximately 35km into race, where leaders established gaps
- "Unnamed Climb of Hell" - third climb
- "False Flat section" - roughly 70km in
- Final climb before Branxholm finish
(https://www.ambmag.com.au/feature/2024-devils-cardigan-gravel-national-609264/)

**Terrain Variation [ELITE observation]:** "Riding from the townships and farmlands of the valleys through the forestry plantations of the mountain slopes and up into the sub alpine terrain from the plateau at 1000m above sea level was special and something rarely experienced in a race event." (https://marathonmtb.com/2021/07/04/the-devils-cardigan-gravel-race-sets-the-scene-in-tasmania-with-epic-course-and-conditions/)

**Start/Finish Locations:** "Starting at the Blue Derby trail head and looping over the Mt Victoria Forest reserve and winding through the spectacular farming country in the valleys of the Dorset area before finishing in the historic logging town of Branxholm." (https://marathonmtb.com/2021/07/04/the-devils-cardigan-gravel-race-sets-the-scene-in-tasmania-with-epic-course-and-conditions/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Elite Men's Start Intensity [ELITE]:** "The elite men's race... started fast and a large group of riders formed on the first climb up Mutual Road. The pace was fast, pushing well into threshold territory for the first 15 minutes." (https://www.ambmag.com.au/feature/2024-devils-cardigan-gravel-national-609264/)

**Feed Station Timing [ELITE]:** "Dead Horse Hill Descent... goes straight into the first feed station" - located after the first major climb and descent, approximately 15-20km into the race based on course description. (https://www.ambmag.com.au/feature/2024-devils-cardigan-gravel-national-609264/)

**Critical Race Sections [ELITE level timing]:** The race becomes decisive early - "Brendan 'Trekky' Johnson and Adam Blazevic... rode out of sight up the Ralph Falls Climb, approximately 35km into the race" - meaning elite race selection happens in first third of course. (https://www.ambmag.com.au/feature/2024-devils-cardigan-gravel-national-609264/)

**Women's Elite Tactics [ELITE]:** "A couple of men's elite groups passed the three women, giving Justine and Courtney the opportunity to jump on for part of the climb" - elite women strategically used passing men's groups to pace on climbs. (https://www.ambmag.com.au/feature/2024-devils-cardigan-gravel-national-609264/)

**XL Cardigan Strategy [ELITE]:** For the unsanctioned 150km "XL Cardigan," Scott Mattern started at 4 a.m. to complete the 50km loop before the 8 a.m. main race start, then joined the 100km race. (https://theradavist.com/australian-gravel-national-championships)

**Elite Winning Times - 2025:**
- Men's Winner: Brendan Johnston - 3:24:12 (106km)
- Women's Winner: Talia Appleton - 4:03:15 (106km)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Mechanical Failures:** Multiple punctures reported on rough terrain, particularly on "Dead Horse Hill Descent" and rocky sections. Cassia Boglio punctured during 2024 elite women's race, Tiffany Cromwell had a "mid-race puncture" in 2025. (https://www.ambmag.com.au/feature/2024-devils-cardigan-gravel-national-609264/ and https://burgh.cc/gravel-goes-global-the-devils-cardigans-uci-debut-in-derby-tasmania/)

**Crashes:** "Defending Cardigan wearer Connor Sens had his first unlucky encounter at the top of Mutual Road right after the Mutual Valley climb, where he crashed off the side of the trail." (https://www.ambmag.com.au/feature/2024-devils-cardigan-gravel-national-609264/)

**Weather-Related Challenges:** "Freezing temps, driving sleet and erratic downpours" in 2021, with heavy rain causing "flowing rivers appeared across the course" in 2023. (https://marathonmtb.com/2021/07/04/the-devils-cardigan-gravel-race-sets-the-scene-in-tasmania-with-epic-course-and-conditions/ and https://theradavist.com/australian-gravel-national-championships)

**Course Severity:** The name itself suggests difficulty - "As the organisers state it is the DEVILS cardigan, not the angels cardigan!" The course is "physically, mentally and technically challenging." (https://marathonmtb.com/2021/07/04/the-devils-cardigan-gravel-race-sets-the-scene-in-tasmania-with-epic-course-and-conditions/)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Post-Race Celebration:** "After a bit of a freshen up and presentations at the local hall, everyone flocked to the Dorsett Hotel in Derby for a well-deserved and eagerly anticipated banger of a dinner, chat with mates and another beer (or 3) by the fire. Another Devils done and memories made." (https://www.ambmag.com.au/feature/2024-devils-cardigan-gravel-national-609264/)

**Local Community Support:** "How good is the North East Lions Club! Each year this passionate group of locals come together and cook an incredible amount of soup and food to nourish your post race depleted souls! This year it was 145 Litres of Soup complimented by the tastiest sausages this side of the sideling...

**Volunteer Support:** "No race or event can be organised without the help of an army of volunteers that give up their time and energy to keep you all safe and sound on course... POC Sports for specifically looking after our Vollunteers this year by keeping them warm and cosy in POC hoodies." (https://www.devilscardigan.com.au/2023-race-recap-1)

**Pre-Race Atmosphere:** "On the morning of the Devils Cardigan 2024, Derby was buzzing. As everyone anticipated, it was icy cold with frost settling on the trees and heaps of mumbling from everyone about how cold it was. Derby looked like it had a thick blanket of fog thrown over it as a sea of riders warmed up all along the Derby streets – nervous but excited about what lay ahead." (https://www.ambmag.com.au/feature/2024-devils-cardigan-gravel-national-609264/)

**Finish Line Experience:** "Everyone's race experience would have been a bit different but there were all smiles at the finish line in Branxholm (ok, let's be honest: some were actually grimacing!)." (https://www.ambmag.com.au/feature/2024-devils-cardigan-gravel-national-609264/)

**Event Spirit:** "However, this race is about far more than results... It was a genuine feeling of achieving something 'epic' finishing this race... Friends made from out on course." (https://marathonmtb.com/2021/07/04/the-devils-cardigan-gravel-race-sets-the-scene-in-tasmania-with-epic-course-and-conditions/)

**Gravel Racing Culture:** "Gravel racing in parts of the northern hemisphere has become a legitimate professional discipline... Whilst the racing has become quite lucrative for some the scene sustains a more friendly and down to earth atmosphere. This makes it a perfect fit for MTB racers keen to broaden their horizons from singletrack and for road riders to seek a little more sense of adventure." (https://marathonmtb.com/2021/07/04/the-devils-cardigan-gravel-race-sets-the-scene-in-tasmania-with-epic-course-and-conditions/)

**2025 UCI Event Profile:** "As silver sponsors, we were proud to play a small part in something big – providing spot prizes, financial support, and sponsoring a brilliant Q&A session featuring Tiffany Cromwell, Mark O'Brien and Grace Brown. Their candid conversation on gravel racing, mindset and progression in cycling brought extra heart to the festival atmosphere." (https://burgh.cc/gravel-goes-global-the-devils-cardigans-uci-debut-in-derby-tasmania/)

**Event Growth:** 2021 had "120 hardy souls," 2025 attracted "over 360 riders from across Australia, New Zealand and the UK" after joining UCI Gravel World Series.
