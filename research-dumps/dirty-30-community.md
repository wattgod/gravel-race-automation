# DIRTY 30 — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Kari Stuart [ELITE]:** "Close to home, perfect gravel roads, and a nice vibe from the quaint little community of Saranac. There are several options for distances and a small field. It's exactly what you want from a local gravel event!" (https://stuartcoaching.com/dirty-30-race-report/)

**Kari Stuart [ELITE]:** "There's a howl worthy downhill around mile 12 and the finish is fast and fun too. The sun was out the whole time, and it was starting to get hot! Only one bottle came with me, and I downed every last drop." (https://stuartcoaching.com/dirty-30-race-report/)

**Kari Stuart [ELITE]:** "She took 1st in our age group, and I was 2nd with a difference of 6-seconds. Doh!" (https://stuartcoaching.com/dirty-30-race-report/)

**Annika Rollock [UNKNOWN]:** "The Dirty 30 is a technical 50k trail run in Golden Gate Canyon State Park. I don't think I fully realized what this meant until I got there and spent some of the run climbing on my hands and knees over boulders marked as 'trail this way.'" (https://www.annikarollock.com/blog/race-report-dirty-30)

**Annika Rollock [UNKNOWN]:** "Although I live at altitude in Boulder, the majority of the race was over 8000 ft, which is close to 3000 ft higher than where I had been living and training." (https://www.annikarollock.com/blog/race-report-dirty-30)

**Annika Rollock [UNKNOWN]:** "According to my Coros, I spent 2% or 8 minutes of this run in Z2 (lol), 49% or 3:38 hours in Z3, and 49% or 3:34 hours at Z4/threshold. This was somewhat unexpected, as I had planned to spend a lot more of the race at Z2, but at no point did I 'blow up' or bonk." (https://www.annikarollock.com/blog/race-report-dirty-30)

**Andrew Skurka [ELITE]:** "I finished in 5:26:33, an average pace of 10:11 minutes/mile. Last year, this time would have put me on the finishers podium in 3rd place; this year, it netted 19th, which is a testament to the significantly deeper field." (https://andrewskurka.com/dirty-30-race-report-wake-up/)

**Andrew Skurka [ELITE]:** "My performance was about what I expected — very mediocre. In contrast to The North Face 50-Mile Championship in December, I never got serious about this race: I showed up under-trained and overweight, and mentally I was less ready to suffer." (https://andrewskurka.com/dirty-30-race-report-wake-up/)

**Andrew Skurka [ELITE]:** "Conservatively, I can afford to lose 4.6 lbs pounds of body fat off my 160-lb frame, or 3 percent. In a 5.5-hour race, this translates into a 10-minute savings, which at Dirty 30 could have been the difference between Top 10 and Top 20." (https://andrewskurka.com/dirty-30-race-report-wake-up/)

**Jason Fitzgerald [COMPETITIVE]:** "I cut the course. I would never do this on purpose but alas, this is often the reality when it comes to technical trail races in the mountains. My Strava data clearly shows me turning around in the middle of an ascent. My memory of that moment is that I reached a rocky clearing in the trail, had no idea where to go, and I thought I found a trail marking." (https://strengthrunning.com/2019/06/dirty-30-race-report-dq/)

**Jason Fitzgerald [COMPETITIVE]:** "The Dirty 30 12-mile race wasn't terribly long. But when you see the elevation and altitude map, you'll understand why I barely cracked 11:00 minutes per mile." (https://strengthrunning.com/2019/06/dirty-30-race-report-dq/)

**Jason Fitzgerald [COMPETITIVE]:** "I flip flopped between two competing emotions: An unwavering aggression to push uphill, hammer downhill, and take advantage of the terrain to run faster [and] Utter defeat and a resignation that just finishing, no matter my effort, is a fine goal." (https://strengthrunning.com/2019/06/dirty-30-race-report-dq/)

**Lynn K Hall [RECREATIONAL]:** "In 2013, I was worn down from my first 50 mile race immediately followed by a road marathon. I started the Dirty 30 feeling strong, but somewhere near mile 21 things quickly turned disastrous. At one point I even sat down on a large rock on the side of the trail, tucking my head into my lap and wishing I could quit then and there (I was miles from a road or aid station)." (https://lynnkhall.com/2014/06/01/dirty-30-race-report/)

**Lynn K Hall [RECREATIONAL]:** "Results: 9:32, 4 minutes slower than last year (though this year's course was 2-3 miles longer). But the difference is that this year I am proud of myself for finishing and not at all ashamed of my time. 15% of the field DNF'ed." (https://lynnkhall.com/2014/06/01/dirty-30-race-report/)

**Lynn K Hall [RECREATIONAL]:** "At one point I looked down at an Ironman tattoo on the calf of the guy in front of me and realized just with whom I was trying to keep up. Nothing good comes from this line of thought." (https://lynnkhall.com/2014/06/01/dirty-30-race-report/)

**Paula (riding with Lynn) [RECREATIONAL]:** After chatting for over 10 miles, Lynn noted: "It's amazing how much you can bond for over 10 miles. And it was amazing how much she could keep talking when I could hardly breathe! I was sooooo thankful." (https://lynnkhall.com/2014/06/01/dirty-30-race-report/)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Kari Stuart [ELITE]:** Wore short-sleeve jersey, vest, and shorts in 42°F weather: "I may have looked underdressed compared with others in my short-sleeve jersey, vest, and shorts – but I felt PERFECT. Out on the course, there were riders in thermal bibs, heavy jackets, mittens, and toe covers. Not to say they were wrong, but I'm glad I went with less." She notes this is specific to being a 46-year-old woman who runs hot. (https://stuartcoaching.com/dirty-30-race-report/)

**Kari Stuart [ELITE]:** Single bottle hydration for 16-mile race: "Only one bottle came with me, and I downed every last drop. Plus, I nibbled on some Scratch energy chews." (https://stuartcoaching.com/dirty-30-race-report/)

**Annika Rollock [UNKNOWN]:** "I tracked most of my data using a combination of my Coros Apex watch and a chest strap heart rate monitor. There was a period of time in early May when my Wahoo monitor bit the dust...I replaced it with a Garmin model midway through the month." (https://www.annikarollock.com/blog/race-report-dirty-30)

**Lynn K Hall [RECREATIONAL]:** "Before the race, I moved my gummy bear stash from their usual ziplock bag in a back pocket of my Salomon pack to a pocket next to my ribs. They ended up melting and goo-ing up my pack, shirt, and left hand (from holding my sides during the steeper climbs) for the entirety of the second half of the race. Ew!" (https://lynnkhall.com/2014/06/01/dirty-30-race-report/)

## Weather Experienced

**Kari Stuart [ELITE] - 2024:** "Was 42° and sunny when Ben dropped me off. That's one of those tricky temps where you're not quite sure what to wear." For the 16-mile race, wind was significant: "The wind was no joke – 15-20 mph wind out of the west-southwest." (https://stuartcoaching.com/dirty-30-race-report/)

**Andrew Skurka [ELITE] - 2015:** "A classic Colorado start for the Dirty 30: beautiful morning light, brisk temperatures, and thin mountain air." Late-May timing "guaranteed at least a few nice days beforehand for long training efforts." (https://andrewskurka.com/dirty-30-race-report-wake-up/)

**Annika Rollock [UNKNOWN] - 2022:** "I was freezing at the 30 degree start, and I was surprised to see the giant thunderstorm roll through at mile 30. Thankfully, I was able to get back to the finish line before the real rain and hail started." Also noted: "I was fairly certain that Coros uses HR to estimate metabolic rate, but now I wonder if it takes into account elevation gain, too" as calories/mile corresponded with elevation gain. (https://www.annikarollock.com/blog/race-report-dirty-30)

**Lynn K Hall [RECREATIONAL] - 2014:** "I struggled with heavy fatigue in my muscles and then I began to get a migraine probably from low blood sugar. (It was one of the few races/days in the mountains that my headache got worse, not better, over the course of the day)." (https://lynnkhall.com/2014/06/01/dirty-30-race-report/)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Kari Stuart [ELITE] - Michigan 16-mile course:** "All of The Dirty 30 routes start off with 150 feet of gain over the first mile. It's nothing steep, but enough to get your heart rate up. A great reason to make sure you warm up before these races! From there the next 12 miles were relatively flat, very minimal traffic and the gravel was hero." (https://stuartcoaching.com/dirty-30-race-report/)

**Kari Stuart [ELITE] - 30-mile course specifics:** "There are two small but notable climbs on the 16-mile route, but there is one significant monster hill on the 30 – Ivan the Terrible. It's a steady and steep climb just a mile or two from the end of the race, which makes you wonder if gravel racing is maybe not all that fun after all. Once you get to the top, you get to soon soar down to the finish line." (https://stuartcoaching.com/dirty-30-race-report/)

**Annika Rollock [UNKNOWN] - Colorado trail run:** "The Dirty 30 is a technical 50k trail run in Golden Gate Canyon State Park...I spent some of the run climbing on my hands and knees over boulders marked as 'trail this way.'" Course specs: "Unofficially, the 31.8-mile course has 7,800 vertical feet of gain, with elevations ranging from 7,750 to 9,500 feet" according to Andrew Skurka. (https://www.annikarollock.com/blog/race-report-dirty-30)

**Annika Rollock [UNKNOWN]:** "There were more unrunnable sections (for me) than I expected, including some scrambles and the monster of Windy Peak at mile 28." (https://www.annikarollock.com/blog/race-report-dirty-30)

**Andrew Skurka [ELITE]:** At Aid 4 (final 7 miles): "Only two runners finishing between 6th and 18th place bested my 1:12 split for the final 7 miles between Aid 4 and the Finish." (https://andrewskurka.com/dirty-30-race-report-wake-up/)

**Jason Fitzgerald [COMPETITIVE]:** Course marking issues: "I reached a rocky clearing in the trail, had no idea where to go, and I thought I found a trail marking. But, as my wife will tell you, I don't have a great sense of direction." Later: "I got lost at this exact spot in earlier years too!" (https://strengthrunning.com/2019/06/dirty-30-race-report-dq/)

**Lynn K Hall [RECREATIONAL] - Colorado 50k:** "The race was supposed to be 50K (31 miles) but due to flood damage and a re-route, ended up somewhere approaching 34 miles. Vertical gain: 8,000K, felt like 10K!" At mile 25-28: "At that point, runners can either turn left for one last climb, this time up Windy Peak, in a 5.5 mile loop, OR they can choose a big DNF." (https://lynnkhall.com/2014/06/01/dirty-30-race-report/)

**Dirty 30 website [OFFICIAL]:** Michigan gravel course: "The Dirty 30 gravel bike race course consists of almost 90% gravel roads, the largest percentage of gravel compared to other gravel grinder bike races in West Michigan." (https://dirtythirtygravelgrinder.com/dirty30/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Kari Stuart [ELITE] - 16-mile gravel:** "What I lack in athleticism, I make up for in drafting skill! Dozens of years of riding on Ben's back wheel have taught me to stay alert and hang on to that wheel. I am also particularly skilled at finding just the right person to ride behind. There he was – a broader man with calves like boulders and a very steady cadence. He was riding a bit quicker than I could maintain on my own, and boy did he do a good job of blocking the wind! So I hung on his back wheel for those stretches directly into the wind." (https://stuartcoaching.com/dirty-30-race-report/)

**Annika Rollock [UNKNOWN] - 50k trail run:** Training approach: "I realized about a month into training that if I wanted to survive the race, I would need to start chasing vert. I think in the end this was way more important than weekly milage, as the Dirty 30 course boasts a hefty 7300+ feet of vert over 32 miles. This took a lot of mental discipline and forced me to reset how I viewed split times. Instead of trying to go as fast as possible, I tried to simulate race terrain and practice long, sustained climbs. I started thinking in terms of 'time on feet' and 'vert' rather than pure mileage covered." (https://www.annikarollock.com/blog/race-report-dirty-30)

**Annika Rollock [UNKNOWN]:** Race-day pacing reality: "According to my Coros, I spent 2% or 8 minutes of this run in Z2 (lol), 49% or 3:38 hours in Z3, and 49% or 3:34 hours at Z4/threshold. This was somewhat unexpected, as I had planned to spend a lot more of the race at Z2, but at no point did I 'blow up' or bonk." (https://www.annikarollock.com/blog/race-report-dirty-30)

**Annika Rollock [UNKNOWN]:** Power hiking importance: "During the race, I got my ass handed to me by some older folks who were power hiking monsters. I'm now totally sold on the ability to walk very quickly up hills." Training lesson: "If I had to do it again, I would spend more of my long runs on steeper terrain and really try to work on my hiking speed." (https://www.annikarollock.com/blog/race-report-dirty-30)

**Annika Rollock [UNKNOWN]:** Aid station strategy: "I finally learned the meaning of the phrase 'ultramarathons are an eating/drinking contest with some exercise in between' and was glad I refilled water/Tailwind and snacked at every chance. Some friends suggested setting a 30 minute timer to eat/drink, and at first that sounded too frequent, but it stuck in my mind through" [the race]. (https://www.annikarollock.com/blog/race-report-dirty-30)

**Andrew Skurka [ELITE]:** Weight/performance correlation: "As a general rule of thumb, 1 percent extra body fat results in a 1 percent decrease in running performance. But in a mountainous trail race, I suspect the effect is more significant — versus running on flat surfaces, it costs additional energy to carry extra weight uphill and to slow it down on descents." (https://andrewskurka.com/dirty-30-race-report-wake-up/)

**Andrew Skurka [ELITE]:** Forgot critical items: "With each event, I learn more about pacing, race-day nutrition and hydration, and preparation (course scouting, competitive research, and tapering). I also learn what not to do — like making a last-minute pack swap and accidentally leaving behind salt tablets and caffeine!" (https://andrewskurka.com/dirty-30-race-report-wake-up/)

**Lynn K Hall [RECREATIONAL]:** Starting position mistake: "Too fast at the start! Even though I told myself repeatedly before the race that my ideal position would be in the very back of the pack, somehow I still found myself among a group of runners who wanted to go faster than I did. Because we were on single track for a solid four miles, I pushed myself to stay with them so that I wouldn't clog up the line, and ended up putting in a half-marathon effort when I should have been conserving." (https://lynnkhall.com/2014/06/01/dirty-30-race-report/)

**Lynn K Hall [RECREATIONAL]:** Mental game turnaround: "My mental game turned around about ten miles in when I heard the runner in front of me talking to another runner about a possible Nolan's 14 attempt later this summer...As soon as I began asking him about his plans, my mind pulled away from number crunching and I was finally able to relax, let my lungs open up, and settle into a sustainable pace." (https://lynnkhall.com/2014/06/01/dirty-30-race-report/)

**Lynn K Hall [RECREATIONAL]:** Critical decision point at mile 25-28: "Leading up to this check point, I had it in my mind I wouldn't continue...When the volunteer at the check point told us that the storm was moving the opposite direction and that we had beaten the cut-off time, I was crushed. Crushed because I wanted the excuse to stop pushing myself. Never before had I been so sure I would DNF. But Paula made that left turn, and bonded over our mutual desire to push one another, I followed her. Hardest. Choice. Ever." (https://lynnkhall.com/2014/06/01/dirty-30-race-report/)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Annika Rollock [UNKNOWN]:** Weather as DNF factor: "I did not check the weather the morning of the race...I was surprised to see the giant thunderstorm roll through at mile 30. Thankfully, I was able to get back to the finish line before the real rain and hail started, but that could have been a very bad day." (https://www.annikarollock.com/blog/race-report-dirty-30)

**Lynn K Hall [RECREATIONAL]:** DNF rate: "15% of the field DNF'ed" in 2014. (https://lynnkhall.com/2014/06/01/dirty-30-race-report/)

**Lynn K Hall [RECREATIONAL]:** Nutrition failure leading to near-DNF: "Nutrition. I didn't eat nearly enough. I tried a variety of foods but had to force it all down. I struggled with heavy fatigue in my muscles and then I began to get a migraine probably from low blood sugar." She managed to continue with caffeinated GU but "many of the down sections were particularly painful when my feet slammed against the ground." (https://lynnkhall.com/2014/06/01/dirty-30-race-report/)

**Lynn K Hall [RECREATIONAL]:** Mental breaking point: "At one point I even sat down on a large rock on the side of the trail, tucking my head into my lap and wishing I could quit then and there (I was miles from a road or aid station). Two guys, who were also struggling, coaxed me into standing up and turning their duo into a trio." (https://lynnkhall.com/2014/06/01/dirty-30-race-report/)

**Lynn K Hall [RECREATIONAL]:** Cut-off pressure: "Paula and I had been hearing thunder for over an hour, and even worse, we were bumping up against the cut-off time. I was telling myself just to make it to that point and then we could cut out." (https://lynnkhall.com/2014/06/01/dirty-30-race-report/)

**Jason Fitzgerald [COMPETITIVE]:** Course navigation as DQ risk: "I cut the course...this is often the reality when it comes to technical trail races in the mountains." He noted getting lost "at this exact spot in earlier years too!" suggesting persistent marking issues at certain locations. (https://strengthrunning.com/2019/06/dirty-30-race-report-dq/)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Kari Stuart [ELITE]:** "Close to home, perfect gravel roads, and a nice vibe from the quaint little community of Saranac. There are several options for distances and a small field. It's exactly what you want from a local gravel event!" Also: "now in its seventh year, it's a well directed event." (https://stuartcoaching.com/dirty-30-race-report/)

**Kari Stuart [ELITE]:** Kids race experience: "Cassie participated in the kids 3-mile race. It was a free event, on the trail, which turns from pavement to crushed gravel. We rode together and had a nice ride. It was her first gravel experience, and when I called her a 'rockstar' she replied, 'Well yea, we are riding on rocks, mom!'" (https://stuartcoaching.com/dirty-30-race-report/)

**Annika Rollock [UNKNOWN]:** Volunteer quality: "I agree, it's a well organized event with very encouriging volunteers and spectators." (https://www.annikarollock.com/blog/race-report-dirty-30)

**Andrew Skurka [ELITE]:** Personal recognition boost: "A quick thanks to a few spectators and other runners for recognizing me, including Scott Spillman at the start line (nice race, BTW), Cory near Aid 3, and a 12k runner shortly after Aid 4. On a day when I wasn't feeling especially great about myself, it was a nice boost." (https://andrewskurka.com/dirty-30-race-report-wake-up/)

**Jason Fitzgerald [COMPETITIVE]:** Volunteer positivity: "The positivity and excitement I felt from the volunteers, which made me have an even better time on the trails" and "Serenity from running some of the most beautiful trails in the country" and "Deep satisfaction from running hard when I was tired, confronting my destructive inner thoughts, and finishing strong." Also: "I loved seeing other runners get after it, do well, and being able to share in that camaraderie." (https://strengthrunning.com/2019/06/dirty-30-race-report-dq/)

**Lynn K Hall [RECREATIONAL]:** Trail community bonds: "Made friends. My mental game turned around about ten miles in when I heard the runner in front of me talking to another runner about a possible Nolan's 14 attempt...Turns out my new friend (Bill) has done over 20 100 mile races and close to 100 ultras in total. Absolutely awe-inspiring." Later: "Paula and I kept a similar pace, so we teamed up. She pushed me on the climbs, and I think I pushed her a tad on the descents, so it was an advantageous partnership. The best part was the conversation which took my mind off of the suffering. It's amazing how much you can bond for over 10 miles." (https://lynnkhall.com/2014/06/01/dirty-30-race-report/)

**Lynn K Hall [RECREATIONAL]:** Spousal support: "Hero points to my husband, Nick, for waiting hours for me at the finish line, meeting me a ways up the trail before the finish, hauling my shiat to the shuttle and then to the car, driving home, pulling over when I needed to puke, and listening to my post-race moaning!" (https://lynnkhall.com/2014/06/01/dirty-30-race-report/)

**Dirty 30 website [OFFICIAL]:** Community giving: "A portion of the race proceeds will go towards the improvement of the rail trail that goes through Saranac." (https://dirtythirtygravelgrinder.com/dirty30/)
