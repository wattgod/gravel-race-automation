# DIRTY DINO — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Cassie Cobb [COMPETITIVE]:** "The ride was amazing, and all 8 miles of gravel on our short course were pristine – I was joking with my climbing buddy that we could be on our road bikes (that's how nice the gravel is!). The aid station at the top of the climb marked our turn around and after grabbing some First Endurance EFS and Swedish Fish snacks, we turned down for the descent into the wind. The headwinds made the last few miles a slow grind, but it was all smiles at the finish!" (https://www.cyclingwest.com/racing/gravel-racing/inaugural-dirty-dino-gravel-grinder-rider-reports/)

**John Cobb [COMPETITIVE]:** "Dirty Dino was a messy and fun adventure. We started with a soul crushing climb into the woods, stringing out the field. By mile 30, civilization had faded into the rear-view mirror and hope was a mirage of an aid station up ahead... The final miles became a group effort, as stragglers were plucked into a pace line for the asphalt finish. Not to be out done by Moe or Curly, we blew past the last turn and scrambled back for our photo finish. Exhausted and dehydrated, I fell to the elementary school lawn, creating my rendition of a starfish."

**Dawn Manfredonia [COMPETITIVE]:** "I signed up for the very challenging Dino-Mite course which was a grueling 106 miles with 9,400 ft of vertical gain, but I made more than a few mistakes with my nutrition and hydration and wound up switching to the Dino-Bite 60-mile course which was still a whopping 6,155 ft of climbing. I was reminded that mental fitness is as important as physical fitness. I had a lot of anxiety before this race and kept questioning myself on whether or not I could do a race like this, so I didn't sleep well the night before... I still don't enjoy climbing, but that won't stop me from challenging myself to events like this again!" (https://www.cyclingwest.com/racing/gravel-racing/inaugural-dirty-dino-gravel-grinder-rider-reports/)

**DNA Cycling Crew [COMPETITIVE]:** "Within the first 15 miles, we gained 3,100 ft of vert climbing Taylor Mountain Road. After the main climb, riders found rolling terrain with punchy climbs and fast descents. Temperatures were perfect. The higher riders climbed, the cooler it became. The final summit push for the Dino Bite loop passes by Simm's Peak at mile 30. With 29 miles left, riders start the descent back to the finish. For those wondering about support, it couldn't have been better. Aid stations were stocked, and the volunteers were fantastic. This event is on our to-do list for years to come. Highly recommend." (https://www.cyclingwest.com/racing/gravel-racing/inaugural-dirty-dino-gravel-grinder-rider-reports/)

**Matt Tennison [COMPETITIVE]:** "Interesting day. Definitely not my best, but I gave all that I had. The elevation literally drained me. I could barely push low endurance on the out and back climb, and I was completely destroyed. Then when I got back down to the pavement, back into the oxygen, I was able to push upper endurance and tempo again." (https://www.cyclingwest.com/racing/gravel-racing/inaugural-dirty-dino-gravel-grinder-rider-reports/)

**SooperDew [UNKNOWN]:** "This was my first organized gravel event and it was amazing. I did the 100 miler which had 10,400 feet of climbing and topped out at 10,100 feet above sea level according to my Karoo2... The gravel conditions were pretty much idyllic, forest roads were super smooth and wide nearly the entire time with the split of gravel to asphalt being like 70/30. Was without a doubt the most beautiful ride I've ever done scenery wise and the support was on par with what I experienced at Ironman events. Fully stocked aid stations every 15ish miles, two of which had local bike mechanics available. The overall spirit of gravel vibes were 10/10 with everyone just having a good time and being super positive."

**bergensbanen [UNKNOWN]:** "I loved that race and everyone I talked to there wanted to come back and race it again. It has amazing gravel roads that take you up into the Ashley National Forest with a ton of climbing. Beautiful scenery the whole time, and during the race I pulled out my phone a few times to take some photos. I met nothing but wonderful people at the race and even shared a meal and beer with my new friends afterwards. I really didn't feel it was over-commercialized..the organizer and her family were present for the whole thing and it seemed really welcoming and they went for a ride with us the day before."

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**John Cobb [COMPETITIVE]:** Rode the Dino-Bite (60-mile) course on a mountain bike (noted as "on an MTB no less!" in results) and still placed 3rd in his age group 30-39. (https://www.cyclingwest.com/racing/gravel-racing/inaugural-dirty-dino-gravel-grinder-rider-reports/)

**pickles_in_a_nickle [RECREATIONAL]:** "I'm on an older (hard to believe that 2019 is old) Sram Rival 1X11 group-set with a 42T chainring and it is a biiiitch when the incline gets above 8-9%... From the looks of the race the steepest ascents are right there around that 8% range so I know I can dig through it. My question to the gaggle of grinders here is should I upgrade my group-set before the race?... I'm already ok to stick with an aluminum frame and my 42MM WTB Resolutes as I really dig the feel and peddling efficiency of this setup." Planning to ride the Stegosaurus (58-mile) course. (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/1cy36pa/first_gravel_race/)

**bergensbanen [UNKNOWN]:** "I am thinking of using my road shoes so I can use my power meter pedals. Probably running Maxxis Ramblers to be safe, no idea of what grip is needed." (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/1470vj8/anyone_raced_the_dirty_dino_gravel_grinder_in_utah/)

**Race Director, via Gran Fondo Guide [UNKNOWN]:** "Honestly, you could ride anything from a gravel bike to a cross bike to a full squish MTB. Most riders will be on gravel-specific bikes as that will be the most comfortable for all the terrain. You'll definitely want knobby tires at least, though the gravel sections are not super technical." (https://www.granfondoguide.com/Events/Index/10508/dirty-dino-gravel)

(https://www.cyclingwest.com/racing/gravel-racing/inaugural-dirty-dino-gravel-grinder-rider-reports/)

**John Cobb [COMPETITIVE] - Dino-Bite (60 miles, 6,155 ft):** "We started with a soul crushing climb into the woods, stringing out the field. By mile 30, civilization had faded into the rear-view mirror... Soon after, the descent pushed us into a valley with running water and cliffs on both sides. The final miles became a group effort, as stragglers were plucked into a pace line for the asphalt finish." (https://www.cyclingwest.com/racing/gravel-racing/inaugural-dirty-dino-gravel-grinder-rider-reports/)

**DNA Cycling Crew [COMPETITIVE] - Dino-Bite (58.3 miles, 5,766 ft):** "Within the first 15 miles, we gained 3,100 ft of vert climbing Taylor Mountain Road. After the main climb, riders found rolling terrain with punchy climbs and fast descents... The final summit push for the Dino Bite loop passes by Simm's Peak at mile 30.

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Dawn Manfredonia [COMPETITIVE]:** "I made more than a few mistakes with my nutrition and hydration and wound up switching to the Dino-Mite 60-mile course... I was reminded that mental fitness is as important as physical fitness. I had a lot of anxiety before this race and kept questioning myself on whether or not I could do a race like this, so I didn't sleep well the night before." Highlights the importance of pre-race mental preparation and proper nutrition/hydration planning for high-altitude climbing. (https://www.cyclingwest.com/racing/gravel-racing/inaugural-dirty-dino-gravel-grinder-rider-reports/)

**Matt Tennison [COMPETITIVE]:** "The elevation literally drained me. I could barely push low endurance on the out and back climb, and I was completely destroyed. Then when I got back down to the pavement, back into the oxygen, I was able to push upper endurance and tempo again." Indicates significant impact of high elevation (10,000+ feet) on pacing ability. (https://www.cyclingwest.com/racing/gravel-racing/inaugural-dirty-dino-gravel-grinder-rider-reports/)

**John Cobb [COMPETITIVE]:** "The final miles became a group effort, as stragglers were plucked into a pace line for the asphalt finish." Suggests working together in the closing sections can be beneficial. (https://www.cyclingwest.com/racing/gravel-racing/inaugural-dirty-dino-gravel-grinder-rider-reports/)

**Cassie Cobb [COMPETITIVE]:** "The headwinds made the last few miles a slow grind" on the Dino-Lite descent/finish, suggesting wind can be a factor on the return sections. (https://www.cyclingwest.com/racing/gravel-racing/inaugural-dirty-dino-gravel-grinder-rider-reports/)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Dawn Manfredonia [COMPETITIVE]:** Switched from 106-mile to 60-mile course mid-race due to nutrition and hydration mistakes combined with sleep deprivation and pre-race anxiety. This demonstrates the race allows course changes if riders are struggling. (https://www.cyclingwest.com/racing/gravel-racing/inaugural-dirty-dino-gravel-grinder-rider-reports/)

**High elevation impact [COMPETITIVE]:** Matt Tennison noted being "completely destroyed" by elevation on climbs, only recovering power output when returning to lower elevations. The highest point reaches 10,100+ feet, which can significantly impact riders not acclimated to altitude. (https://www.cyclingwest.com/racing/gravel-racing/inaugural-dirty-dino-gravel-grinder-rider-reports/)

**Gearing concerns [RECREATIONAL]:** pickles_in_a_nickle expressed concern about a 42T chainring being inadequate for 8%+ grades, asking whether to upgrade before the race. Proper gearing for sustained climbing appears important. (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/1cy36pa/first_gravel_race/)
