# DIRTY FRENCH — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

I need to inform you that there has been a significant misunderstanding: **"DIRTY FRENCH" is not a gravel/cycling race.** All 15 sources provided are about "Dirty French," a restaurant in New York City's Lower East Side, located in the Ludlow Hotel.

The sources cover:
- Restaurant reviews and dining experiences
- Menu items (Duck a l'Orange, Chicken for Two, flatbread, beignets)
- Service quality
- Pricing and atmosphere
- The restaurant is from the Major Food Group team (Mario Carbone, Rich Torrisi, Jeff Zalaznick)

There is **no cycling or gravel race content** in any of the provided sources. The Reddit links appear to be placeholder/generic Reddit pages with no actual content about cycling, and the YouTube videos about French drains are about home drainage systems, not cycling events.
