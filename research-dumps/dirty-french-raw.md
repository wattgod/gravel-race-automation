## BLACK PILL (Brutal Truths)

### The Hard Reality of French Ultra-Gravel

1. **DNF Rates Are Brutal**
   - French Divide 2019: Nearly 50% of starters DNF'd
   - Many scratch "quite early in the first week"
   - Mental torture is as real as physical

2. **It's Not Just Gravel - It's Suffering**
   - Le Pilgrimage organizers literally asked themselves "had we pushed them too far?" watching riders shiver
   - 2,500m elevation in first 50 km is NORMAL for these events
   - Hike-a-bike sections are expected, not exceptions

3. **Weather Will Destroy You**
   - Alpine temperatures can drop to near-zero even in late summer
   - Pouring rain at altitude while already exhausted is common
   - French Divide: Must carry gear for ALL conditions - adds weight, adds suffering

4. **Navigation Nightmares**
   - French Divide vineyard mazes "nearly drove riders mad"
   - GPS tracks through forests with poor signal
   - Getting lost adds hours to already impossible days

5. **The Mental Game**
   - "Plans to exit the race begin to take shape in riders' minds"
   - "Mental rollercoaster with ups and downs just like the track"
   - The beautiful scenery doesn't compensate during the suffering

6. **French Divide Is GONE**
   - 2025 was the FINAL edition - you missed it
   - No replacement announced
   - The hardest French ultra-gravel event no longer exists

7. **Competition for Spots**
   - Le Pilgrimage sold out in 24 HOURS
   - Limited to small participant numbers (47-100 riders)
   - International logistics with limited spots = stressful

8. **Self-Sufficiency Is Real**
   - No support vehicles
   - Carry your own food, repair kit, shelter
   - Find your own lodging on multi-day stages
   - Mechanical failure = your problem

9. **Costs Add Up**
   - Flights from US/UK: $50-200+ per bike in baggage fees alone
   - Bike shipping services add more
   - No prize money covers expenses
   - Lodging near race venues books up months in advance

10. **It's Harder Than You Think**
    - Even Tour de France pros called French gravel "brutal" and "vicious"
    - Pogacar was shocked by how difficult the gravel was
    - If WorldTour pros struggle, recreational riders face exponentially harder days
