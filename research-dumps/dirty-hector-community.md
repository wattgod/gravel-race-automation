## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

The organizers emphasize this is a challenging, technical course: "This race is CHALLENGING and FUN!! It may be MUDDY, it will be HARD, it is BEAUTIFUL and will take GRIT to get through." (https://cycle-cny.com/event/dirty-hector/)

The 2025 race conditions were particularly difficult due to weeks of wet weather leading to "extremely muddy" conditions with "rutted back roads and technical singletrack." (https://nysbra.com/2025/06/30/gravel-champions-dirty-hector-2025/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Elite Performance [ELITE]:** Jack Bernhard's winning time of 2:17:07 represents an extremely strong performance, averaging approximately 17.5 mph over technical terrain with 3,700 feet of climbing. His cyclocross background was noted as key to his success on the technical sections. The front group raced together through much of the course before Bernhard soloed to victory.

**Mid-Pack Times [COMPETITIVE]:** Masters category winners finished in the 2:22-2:40 range for men, suggesting strong recreational to competitive-level riders should plan for 2.5-3+ hours depending on conditions.

**Recreational Pace [RECREATIONAL]:** Finish times extending to 4+ hours indicate the technical nature and difficulty of the course, particularly in muddy conditions. Riders should be prepared for a significantly slower pace than typical gravel road races due to technical sections.
