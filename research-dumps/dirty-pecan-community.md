# DIRTY PECAN — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**K-Dogg [UNKNOWN]:** "Only two of us had ever ridden 150 miles on pavement, but certainly not on heavy dirt roads. And yet we were pushing the agony envelope at the 2016 Dirt(y) Pecan 150 Dirt Road Epic beginning in Monticello, Florida." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/ride-report-dirty-pecan-150-mile-dirt-road-epic-what-were-we-thinking-by-k-dogg/)

**K-Dogg [UNKNOWN]:** "The web site promised that conditions were superb and that skilled riders would 'do fine' on 28 or 30 tires but we knew better. Team Gravel Cyclist rocked 40mm wide tires and up." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/ride-report-dirty-pecan-150-mile-dirt-road-epic-what-were-we-thinking-by-k-dogg/)

**K-Dogg [UNKNOWN]:** "The first 15ish miles was a bike race and of course my fellow Blackwater Gravel Grinders wanted to be near the front. It was like a crit, I thought I was riding near the front but every time I looked back, I was nearly the last guy." (https://davefaitlemonde.com/2025/03/04/dirty-pecan-day-2-monticello-florida/)

**K-Dogg [UNKNOWN]:** "'Guys?' I yelled, as I puffed chasing up a clay hill. 'I'm pretty sure this pace isn't sustainable for another 140 miles.'" (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/ride-report-dirty-pecan-150-mile-dirt-road-epic-what-were-we-thinking-by-k-dogg/)

**davefaitlemonde [UNKNOWN]:** "After a good hard and hot 80 plus miles, I was glad to be back home. I snapped a quick selfie, one where you can't quite tell how haggard I felt." (https://davefaitlemonde.com/2025/03/04/dirty-pecan-day-2-monticello-florida/)

**K-Dogg [UNKNOWN]:** "With five miles to go I drifted off the back on one particularly long hill. A black curtain began to lower as an extreme bonk set in" (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/ride-report-dirty-pecan-150-mile-dirt-road-epic-what-were-we-thinking-by-k-dogg/)

**Randy Honcik [UNKNOWN]:** "We just have a good time talking to people and looking at the beautiful country — all these pecan farms. It's just the energy of the group that's what's best about the whole thing" (https://www.wtxl.com/news/local-news/in-your-neighborhood/monticello/pedaling-for-a-purpose-at-dirty-pecan-gravel-ride-in-monticello)

**Crusty older guy [UNKNOWN]:** "Goddamn cross bikes! I thought I could hold you guys off!" (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/ride-report-dirty-pecan-150-mile-dirt-road-epic-what-were-we-thinking-by-k-dogg/)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Tire Width [UNKNOWN LEVEL]:** Team Gravel Cyclist used 40mm+ tires for the 150-mile route in 2016, noting that the website's suggestion of 28-30mm tires would not be adequate despite promoters saying "skilled riders would do fine." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/ride-report-dirty-pecan-150-mile-dirt-road-epic-what-were-we-thinking-by-k-dogg/)

**Navigation [ALL LEVELS]:** "A pre-loaded GPS cycling computer with your chosen route is a 'must have'. Old school maps won't cut it." The ride description emphasizes this is unsupported with no course markings. (https://www.granfondoguide.com/Contents/IndexFull/8261/)

**Camera Setup [UNKNOWN LEVEL]:** One rider noted: "At that point, I was happy to turn off the gas and turn on the camera" suggesting some riders bring photography equipment for the scenic sections. (https://davefaitlemonde.com/2025/03/04/dirty-pecan-day-2-monticello-florida/)

## Weather Experienced

**2025 (Day 2):** "It was a chilly but beautiful day, about 42 degrees at the start." The last 15 miles featured "a stiff head wind" and conditions were described as "hot" by mile 80. (https://davefaitlemonde.com/2025/03/04/dirty-pecan-day-2-monticello-florida/)

**March General Conditions:** "Average temperatures range from a comfortable 50-70°F in North Florida" with advice to apply sunscreen on exposed skin. "March is a great time to visit Florida! The weather begins to shift from the cooler winter months, making way for the warmth of spring." (https://www.granfondoguide.com/Contents/IndexFull/8261/)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Surface Composition:** The route is described as "75% gravel routes" with "mostly packed sand" and occasional "quiet pavement." Riders encountered "red clay roads," "slippery, greasy, red clay bottom land," and "12 miles of slippery, dead flat wet sand" where maintaining adequate "terra-planing speed" was necessary to survive. (https://davefaitlemonde.com/2025/03/04/dirty-pecan-day-2-monticello-florida/ and https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/ride-report-dirty-pecan-150-mile-dirt-road-epic-what-were-we-thinking-by-k-dogg/)

**Terrain Character:** "Rolling hills" throughout with "sticky and criss crossed by washouts" red clay in sections. The course features "grand southern plantations, oak canopies, farmland and pecan orchards on its totally unique and iconic red clay and dirt." One rider noted "Like Sidewinder snake tracks we could read the desperate flailings of those ahead seeking hard soil." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/ride-report-dirty-pecan-150-mile-dirt-road-epic-what-were-we-thinking-by-k-dogg/ and https://www.granfondoguide.com/Contents/IndexFull/8261/)

**Specific Hazards:** "12 inch high crusty clay ridge" formations that caused crashes. "Red mud spots" appeared randomly. Heavy washouts in clay sections required concentration to avoid crashing. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/ride-report-dirty-pecan-150-mile-dirt-road-epic-what-were-we-thinking-by-k-dogg/ and https://davefaitlemonde.com/2025/03/04/dirty-pecan-day-2-monticello-florida/)

**Scenery:** "Mile after mile we rolled up and down rusty red clay hills through countless bucolic mossy oak tunnels – occasionally breaking into green meadows and gorgeous historic farmsteads. Virtually no traffic. So much openness and so few people. So quiet you could hear a cotton boll drop." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/ride-report-dirty-pecan-150-mile-dirt-road-epic-what-were-we-thinking-by-k-dogg/)

**Remote Nature:** "The roads along the majority of the course are sparsely populated. There will be many miles of riding with no civilization or people in sight... there is no mobile coverage in most places." (https://www.granfondoguide.com/Contents/IndexFull/8261/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Early Pace Control [UNKNOWN LEVEL]:** The 2016 team report describes the first 15 miles as "a bike race" with riders getting caught up in the fast start. One rider warned: "I'm pretty sure this pace isn't sustainable for another 140 miles" after only 10 miles. Another noted: "At this point we were joined by about eight guys, none of which were doing the long course" - suggesting avoiding the fast starters is wise for long-distance riders. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/ride-report-dirty-pecan-150-mile-dirt-road-epic-what-were-we-thinking-by-k-dogg/)

**Nutrition Strategy [UNKNOWN LEVEL]:** K-Dogg received advice from his wife (described as "a scientifical person") to "consume 200 kcal/hour or a big lunch or suffer the consequences." At the Liberty convenience store (mile 68), riders consumed "Coke and cookies" described as "Sugar, grease and caffeine" with some eyeing "glistening fried chicken and potato wedges." K-Dogg also mentioned using "Double Espresso Gu and Ibuprofen" during the middle section. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/ride-report-dirty-pecan-150-mile-dirt-road-epic-what-were-we-thinking-by-k-dogg/)

**Group Riding:** One 2016 group used "race tactics to stay up front where it was safer" early on. The group swapped pulls but noted that "Drafting was little help" in the sandy/heavy terrain. In the worst sand sections: "Drafting an inch off was still virtually useless." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/ride-report-dirty-pecan-150-mile-dirt-road-epic-what-were-we-thinking-by-k-dogg/)

**Route Choice:** The 80-mile option splits from the 100-mile route around mile 55, allowing riders who started with stronger groups to drop to a shorter distance. (https://davefaitlemonde.com/2025/03/04/dirty-pecan-day-2-monticello-florida/)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Bonking:** K-Dogg described his bonk at mile 145: "With five miles to go I drifted off the back on one particularly long hill. A black curtain began to lower as an extreme bonk set in" - this occurred despite attempting to follow a 200 kcal/hour nutrition plan. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/ride-report-dirty-pecan-150-mile-dirt-road-epic-what-were-we-thinking-by-k-dogg/)

**Navigation Failures:** One rider from the 2025 group "made a wrong turn" in the early miles and "took about 30 minutes to get back on track." (https://davefaitlemonde.com/2025/03/04/dirty-pecan-day-2-monticello-florida/)

**Crashes in Clay:** Dr. Pain and Pfaff Daddy crashed when one "tried to change lanes through a 12 inch high crusty clay ridge and bobble-swept Dr. Pain's front wheel out from under him" in slippery red clay. Though no one was hurt, the derailleur was damaged. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/ride-report-dirty-pecan-150-mile-dirt-road-epic-what-were-we-thinking-by-k-dogg/)

**Stiffening at Rest Stops:** After the mile 68 stop: "Eighty-two miles to go and we all had stiffened up enough to need a knight hoist to drop us back on our steeds." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/ride-report-dirty-pecan-150-mile-dirt-road-epic-what-were-we-thinking-by-k-dogg/)

**Lack of Support:** The event website is explicit: "This is an UNSUPPORTED ride (not a race): there is NO support, NO sag stops, NOR support vehicles... YOU are 100% responsible for YOU, YOUR welfare, YOUR equipment, YOUR navigation, and YOUR own food and drink. If you need a juice box and a hug every 20 miles, this is not the ride for you, please stay home." Water stops and stores are marked but "there are 'no guarantees' water will be available, or that stores will 'be open'." (https://www.granfondoguide.com/event/5234/dirty-pecan and https://www.granfondoguide.com/Contents/IndexFull/8261/)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Charitable Focus:** The event benefits Jefferson County 4-H programs. "In 2023, Dirty Pecan Gravel Bike Ride donated $20,000 to Jefferson County 4-H. This money will be used for our 4-H kids to attend camp and 4-H leadership programs. In the last 9 years Dirty Pecan has donated over $170,000 to 4-H." Betsy Barfield, co-founder, stated: "I am so grateful for every little cent that everybody gives. It takes everybody to pull this off. It all adds up, and it moves the needle for our 4-H kids." (https://www.granfondoguide.com/Contents/IndexFull/8261/ and https://www.wtxl.com/news/local-news/in-your-neighborhood/monticello/pedaling-for-a-purpose-at-dirty-pecan-gravel-ride-in-monticello)

**Low-Key Vibe:** Registration is only $25. The event description states: "What makes the Dirty Pecan special isn't just the distances or the eclectic mix of riders—it's the spirit of the event. There are no podiums or trophies, only bragging rights and the satisfaction of having survived." The tagline is "Few Rule-Lots of Fun !!!" (https://www.granfondoguide.com/Contents/IndexFull/8261/ and https://www.granfondoguide.com/event/5234/dirty-pecan)

**Camping Culture:** Dry camping available for $40 for 2 nights with "A huge camp fire awaits you hardy campers!" at the Jefferson County Extension Office HQ. Post-ride activities described include "theraguns, air legs, talk of the day's ride with occasional bad smells." (https://davefaitlemonde.com/2025/03/04/dirty-pecan-day-2-monticello-florida/ and https://www.granfondoguide.com/Contents/IndexFull/8261/)

**Growth:** Now in its 10th year, the event "has more than doubled its attendance" with over 400 cyclists participating in 2025, up from "80 or so riders" in 2016. Places are limited to 700 riders. (https://www.wtxl.com/news/local-news/in-your-neighborhood/monticello/pedaling-for-a-purpose-at-dirty-pecan-gravel-ride-in-monticello and https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/ride-report-dirty-pecan-150-mile-dirt-road-epic-what-were-we-thinking-by-k-dogg/)

**Origin Story:** Co-founder Betsy Barfield explained the name: "Jefferson County is the Pecan Capital of the World, and Fred Mayhan, who US 90 is named after Mayhan Drive, created the Mayhem Pecan. And when you ride gravel — which is what we're riding on Saturday — you get dirty. So we put it together, and there's your Dirty Pecan." The event is described as "a ride as gritty as the roads and as nutty as its name suggests." (https://www.wtxl.com/news/local-news/in-your-neighborhood/monticello/pedaling-for-a-purpose-at-dirty-pecan-gravel-ride-in-monticello and https://www.granfondoguide.com/Contents/IndexFull/8261/)

**Event Personality:** The registration page has a humorous, no-nonsense tone: "If you show up without a registration, you will be sent to the spot for unruly people... ;-)" and "We do have free parking and port-o-lets at ride start" with the note about included amenities being "A juice box and a hug... ;-)" (https://www.granfondoguide.com/event/5234/dirty-pecan)
