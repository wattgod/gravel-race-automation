# DIRTY REIVER — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Rob Weaver [COMPETITIVE]:** "It's one thing to rip along the road in a tightly packed group with your mates, but riding in a bunch on a slippery, unpredictable surface at speed with a bunch of strangers is, at times, terrifying... A gravel event, it seems, is more like the start of the Mega Avalanche, except your brakes aren't as good, and you're wearing far less protection, despite clocking higher speeds – and it seems to last for longer." (https://www.bikeradar.com/features/opinion/five-things-i-learnt-riding-dirty-reiver)

**Rob Weaver [COMPETITIVE]:** "At about the halfway point, around 2 hours 30 minutes in, the wind got up and it rained quite heavily. To say I was pleased with my over-the-top choice of layers would be an understatement. While others shivered, I continued to stay warm and dry." (https://www.bikeradar.com/features/opinion/five-things-i-learnt-riding-dirty-reiver)

**Rob Weaver [COMPETITIVE]:** "It turns out that, like mountain biking, covering that distance when you're rattling over rocks, grit, gravel and mud takes more energy. It's fair to say I underestimated this and should have approached it more like a big day out on the mountain bike." (https://www.bikeradar.com/features/opinion/five-things-i-learnt-riding-dirty-reiver)

**David Arthur [ELITE]:** "The inaugural Dirty Reiver 200km gravel race took place in Kielder Forest at the weekend... it was a success; the organisation was excellent, food stops were among the best I've ever seen, and the course was demanding and challenging but ultimately rewarding, and the expansive views, especially including the snowcapped hills, helped to make it an event to remember." (https://road.cc/content/tech-news/186623-what-bike-dirty-reiver-200km-race)

**Jenny Tough [COMPETITIVE]:** "In the northern hemisphere, the last weekend of April is practically an extravaganza of endurance events, where the general public crawl out of their winter reverie and take their pale legs out for the first test of the year." (https://jennytough.substack.com/p/the-dirty-reiver-200)

**Anonymous Rider [RECREATIONAL]:** "Stealing a glance down at my shoes halfway round the Dirty One-Thirty, I marvelled at just how lavishly they – and the bike – had been painted. A new pale-grey colourway had apparently permeated every crease, fold and machined surface of, well, everything." (https://www.cyclingweekly.com/routes/7-tips-to-nail-your-first-gravel-event-taking-on-britains-dirty-reiver-challenge)

**Anonymous Rider [RECREATIONAL]:** "Despite the excellent surfaces, a light but insistent rain that set in around the third-way mark meant riders' skills met with an extra test as the course slowly became coated in a slick, thin mud. The bright colours of the start pen slowly became ever more muted as wheels flung the stuff over gravel bikes and riders." (https://www.cyclingweekly.com/routes/7-tips-to-nail-your-first-gravel-event-taking-on-britains-dirty-reiver-challenge)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Tire Choice:**

**Rory Hitchens [UNKNOWN] - Kinesis Tripster ATR:** 40mm tyres (https://road.cc/content/tech-news/186623-what-bike-dirty-reiver-200km-race)

**Bruce Dalton [UNKNOWN] - Kinesis Pro 6:** "Clement X'Plor MSO 36mm tubeless tyres" (https://road.cc/content/tech-news/186623-what-bike-dirty-reiver-200km-race)

**Josh Ibbett [ELITE] - Mason Definition road bike:** "35mm Schwalbe G-One tyres" - notably fast around the course on a road bike setup (https://road.cc/content/tech-news/186623-what-bike-dirty-reiver-200km-race)

**David Arthur [ELITE] - Parlee Chebacco:** Used unspecified tires, "had one flat, didn't put a foot wrong" (https://road.cc/content/tech-news/186623-what-bike-dirty-reiver-200km-race)

**General consensus from 2016 edition:** "The common consensus seemed to be that a 40mm tyre was the right fit for the course, preferably one with a bit of tread to provide traction through the muddier sections." (https://road.cc/content/tech-news/186623-what-bike-dirty-reiver-200km-race)

**Bike Setup:**

**Bruce Dalton [UNKNOWN]:** "Double wrap bar tape, inspired by the cobbled classics no doubt, but brilliantly inspired for this event." (https://road.cc/content/tech-news/186623-what-bike-dirty-reiver-200km-race)

**Multiple riders:** Front and rear mudguards widely used - "Mudguards were a sensible addition" (https://road.cc/content/tech-news/186623-what-bike-dirty-reiver-200km-race)

**Bike Types Used:**
- "By far the most popular choice was a cyclocross bike" (https://road.cc/content/tech-news/186623-what-bike-dirty-reiver-200km-race)
- Mountain bikes present: "from lightweight carbon fibre 29er hardtails to full-suspension models"
- "A couple of road and touring bikes"
- "A smattering of gravel/adventure bikes"

**Essential Spares & Tools:**

**Rob Weaver [COMPETITIVE]:** "Carry the essentials, but be sure to pack extra tyre plugs, CO2 canisters (and a pump), tubes and a decent tyre boot, along with the usual kit... The number of people stopped by the side of the fire road fixing punctures was staggering." (https://www.bikeradar.com/features/opinion/five-things-i-learnt-riding-dirty-reiver)

**Anonymous Rider [RECREATIONAL]:** "I had one spare tube, a pack of stick-on patches that I didn't really trust, plus pump and levers. I had no flats, but I consider it a major let-off that I wasn't stranded by the side of the trail... During the event I passed a miserable-looking rider marooned by the trail, wrestling with a muddy tyre and tube in the rain, about once every five to 10 minutes. Next time I'd take three tubes and a repair kit. Snapped chains were also in abundance, so a spare link and chain tool are essential." (https://www.cyclingweekly.com/routes/7-tips-to-nail-your-first-gravel-event-taking-on-britains-dirty-reiver-challenge)

**Clothing:**

**Rob Weaver [COMPETITIVE] - for cold/wet conditions:** "I ended up wearing a baselayer, Windstopper jersey, fleece-lined gilet and Windstopper jacket for the full 130km ride. In similar conditions on a mountain bike, I'd probably wear a baselayer and Windstopper jersey, only pulling out a jacket if the weather really turned." Notes that gravel requires more layers than MTB because "your upper body doesn't really do a whole lot of moving around while you ride." (https://www.bikeradar.com/features/opinion/five-things-i-learnt-riding-dirty-reiver)

**Storage Solutions:**

**Josh Ibbett [ELITE]:** "Minimal on-bike luggage to keep the weight down" - everything in saddle bag and jersey pockets (https://road.cc/content/tech-news/186623-what-bike-dirty-reiver-200km-race)

**David Arthur [ELITE]:** "Tried to keep the weight down (to help on the climbs) with everything stuffed into the saddle bag and my jersey pockets stuffed with waffles and malt loaf." (https://road.cc/content/tech-news/186623-what-bike-dirty-reiver-200km-race)

**Rory Hitchens [UNKNOWN]:** "Apidura frame and top tube bag to store all his food and other essentials" (https://road.cc/content/tech-news/186623-what-bike-dirty-reiver-200km-race)

**General observation:** "The other area of interest was how to carry all the essentials needed for what turned out to be a long day for most people... Some went for frame bags and packs and huge saddle bags, many went with hydration backpacks and some tried to stuff everything into jersey pockets." (https://road.cc/content/tech-news/186623-what-bike-dirty-reiver-200km-race)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Surface Characteristics:**

**General description:** "Expect to be 95% on gravel for the full ride!" (https://dirtyreiver.co.uk/)

**Road.cc description:** "Smooth forest tracks – the sort of gravel riding that most of Britain's curly-barred off-roadies go to sleep dreaming about" with "almost no tarmac" (https://www.cyclingweekly.com/routes/7-tips-to-nail-your-first-gravel-event-taking-on-britains-dirty-reiver-challenge)

**Rob Weaver [COMPETITIVE]:** Describes riding on "slippery, unpredictable surface" and "mud, gravel and slippery embedded rock under your tyres" with "face being pummelled with dirt from the rear tyre of the rider in front" and risk of hitting "pothole/massive rock/someone's bottle/a loose saddle pack" (https://www.bikeradar.com/features/opinion/five-things-i-learnt-riding-dirty-reiver)

**Cycling Weekly description:** "Riders being treated to smooth forest tracks" but conditions deteriorated: "light but insistent rain... meant riders' skills met with an extra test as the course slowly became coated in a slick, thin mud" (https://www.cyclingweekly.com/routes/7-tips-to-nail-your-first-gravel-event-taking-on-britains-dirty-reiver-challenge)

**Climbing:**

**200km route:** "3,100m of ascent – that's a lot of climbing" (https://www.cyclingweekly.com/routes/7-tips-to-nail-your-first-gravel-event-taking-on-britains-dirty-reiver-challenge)

**Course Layout:**

"The routes use the extensive forest access road network in the Northern English Borders... skirts the huge Kielder Water reservoir and continues south in a big, ragged loop through the forest" (https://www.cyclingweekly.com/routes/7-tips-to-nail-your-first-gravel-event-taking-on-britains-dirty-reiver-challenge)

**Feed Zones:**

"Three feed stops on the 200km" that were "50km of very hard riding apart" and "well stocked" - described as "among the best I've ever seen" (https://road.cc/content/tech-news/186623-what-bike-dirty-reiver-200km-race and https://www.cyclingweekly.com/routes/7-tips-to-nail-your-first-gravel-event-taking-on-britains-dirty-reiver-challenge)

**Remoteness:**

"Rides like the Dirty Reiver take participants deep into some of Britain's most sparsely populated terrain. If you break your bike (or even a bone), walking to the next village or flagging down a passing motorist won't be an option." (https://www.cyclingweekly.com/routes/7-tips-to-nail-your-first-gravel-event-taking-on-britains-dirty-reiver-challenge)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Group Riding Dynamics:**

**Rob Weaver [COMPETITIVE]:** "Finding a group of riders you can tag along with helps with not only your pace, but morale, too. These are your Guardians of the Gravelty... Etiquette when riding in a group is important. Following another rider offers shelter from the wind and helps you to save energy, but be prepared to take your turn on the front when it comes... find a good bunch of well-paced, sensible individuals and before you know it, you'll be at the final feed zone with mud in your eyes, a smile on your face and enough energy to keep trucking on for the final few kilometres." (https://www.bikeradar.com/features/opinion/five-things-i-learnt-riding-dirty-reiver)

**Rob Weaver [COMPETITIVE]:** "While it's easy to slip into a hypnotic state watching the rear wheel of the rider in front, you need to keep your head and eyes on a swivel. And, if that rider points to something on the trail or road, be warned... This is in fact a warning that something needs avoiding." (https://www.bikeradar.com/features/opinion/five-things-i-learnt-riding-dirty-reiver)

**Rob Weaver [COMPETITIVE]:** Notes that even when losing contact with one group, "I soon found myself riding with another" due to event size (https://www.bikeradar.com/features/opinion/five-things-i-learnt-riding-dirty-reiver)

**Nutrition Strategy:**

**Rob Weaver [COMPETITIVE]:** "This will sound obvious – but eat as much food as possible if you're heading out on a long ride... It turns out that, like mountain biking, covering that distance when you're rattling over rocks, grit, gravel and mud takes more energy. It's fair to say I underestimated this and should have approached it more like a big day out on the mountain bike. Bars, bananas, sandwiches and whatever else you can attach to yourself or your bike... will all be eaten, so carry whatever you can. And don't forget your electrolytes, like I did." (https://www.bikeradar.com/features/opinion/five-things-i-learnt-riding-dirty-reiver)

**Advice on feed zones [RECREATIONAL perspective]:** "Make the most of the feed zones, if the event you're doing has them. Okay, a longer stop will equate to a slower time, but if you eat too little, and suffer the bonk of all bonks, you'll fail to finish." (https://www.bikeradar.com/features/opinion/five-things-i-learnt-riding-dirty-reiver)

**Anonymous [RECREATIONAL]:** "Food for the whole ride was another essential on the Reiver list. It sounds fairly obvious but it can be easy to place all faith in feed stops... most of us have had the experience of arriving at a feed station to find all the good stuff swiped, or perhaps hitting the wall between them, or even getting lost. On the Reiver, the stops were 50km of very hard riding apart – plenty of time for the bonk to make an unwelcome appearance." (https://www.cyclingweekly.com/routes/7-tips-to-nail-your-first-gravel-event-taking-on-britains-dirty-reiver-challenge)

**Training Preparation:**

**Anonymous [RECREATIONAL]:** "A good rule of thumb for a big distance event like the Dirty Reiver is to ensure you've got a couple of rides of at least 75-80% of event distance under your belt in the six weeks beforehand. Event-day determination should see you through the rest." Emphasizes need for hilly training: "The Dirty Reiver is listed as having 3,100m of ascent – that's a lot of climbing, so those long training rides are going to need to be hilly." (https://www.cyclingweekly.com/routes/7-tips-to-nail-your-first-gravel-event-taking-on-britains-dirty-reiver-challenge)

**Time on Bike:**

**Rob Weaver [COMPETITIVE] - 130km version:** "2 hours 30 minutes in" was approximately halfway (https://www.bikeradar.com/features/opinion/five-things-i-learnt-riding-dirty-reiver)

**Anonymous [RECREATIONAL]:** Notes "five to eight hours" as expected timeframe for pummeling a gravel bike over rough ground (https://www.bikeradar.com/features/opinion/five-things-i-learnt-riding-dirty-reiver)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Mechanical Issues:**

**Rob Weaver [COMPETITIVE]:** "While the best gravel bikes are spectacular bits of kit, many of them (especially their gravel tyres) are relatively fragile compared to modern mountain bikes. As a result, pummel one over rough ground for five to eight hours and you'll more than likely encounter some kind of mechanical hiccup... The number of people stopped by the side of the fire road fixing punctures was staggering. I couldn't believe how many people I saw with wheels out and tubeless sealant everywhere, frantically pumping away in the hope they'd soon be back on their bike." (https://www.bikeradar.com/features/opinion/five-things-i-learnt-riding-dirty-reiver)

**Anonymous [RECREATIONAL]:** "During the event I passed a miserable-looking rider marooned by the trail, wrestling with a muddy tyre and tube in the rain, about once every five to 10 minutes... Snapped chains were also in abundance." (https://www.cyclingweekly.com/routes/7-tips-to-nail-your-first-gravel-event-taking-on-britains-dirty-reiver-challenge)

**Nutrition Failure:**

**Rob Weaver [COMPETITIVE]:** Personal admission of underestimating food needs: "Having ridden the same sort of distance before, albeit on a road bike, I figured the couple of energy bars I had should suffice and get me round just fine. This was not the case." (https://www.bikeradar.com/features/opinion/five-things-i-learnt-riding-dirty-reiver)

**Weather/Exposure:**

**Anonymous [RECREATIONAL]:** "My survival blanket did indeed get used in anger when I was waiting for my companions to return from their big ride" - noting the remoteness and exposure risk (https://www.cyclingweekly.com/routes/7-tips-to-nail-your-first-gravel-event-taking-on-britains-dirty-reiver-challenge)

**Required Safety Equipment:**

"The Dirty Reiver was explicit about what items needed to be carried, including an emergency whistle, a survival blanket and a spare thermal top. The chances of needing such items might seem slim, but their inclusion is warranted." Due to the fact that rides "take participants deep into some of Britain's most sparsely populated terrain." (https://www.cyclingweekly.com/routes/7-tips-to-nail-your-first-gravel-event-taking-on-britains-dirty-reiver-challenge)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Event Structure:**

"The 200km full distance is a rite of passage in the gravel world – a real test of stamina, skill and self reliance." (https://dirtyreiver.co.uk/)

"Dirty Reiver is a challenge ride rather than a race" - but is still timed (https://www.cyclingweekly.com/routes/7-tips-to-nail-your-first-gravel-event-taking-on-britains-dirty-reiver-challenge)

**Event Village:**

"Our 'Gravel Expo', in the event village showcases some of the best brands in the industry. Set in the Kielder Castle grounds with food, drink, showers and barista coffee all on site." (https://dirtyreiver.co.uk/)

**Post-Race Culture:**

**Rob Weaver [COMPETITIVE]:** "Either way, you'll have that warm fuzzy feeling when you roll over the finish line with the ride completed, ready to sup on a nice cold beer (craft beer only, of course – the gravel crew are too cool to accept anything less) and share your tales" (https://www.bikeradar.com/features/opinion/five-things-i-learnt-riding-dirty-reiver)

**Event Atmosphere:**

**Anonymous [RECREATIONAL]:** "'Epic' is a word used way too often, but thanks to the weather, the distance and the terrain, anyone who rode this year's Dirty Reiver can brandish it with impunity." (https://www.cyclingweekly.com/routes/7-tips-to-nail-your-first-gravel-event-taking-on-britains-dirty-reiver-challenge)

**Event Popularity:**

"Now in its 11th year (and 10th edition) the Panaracer Dirty Reiver continues to be the gravel event in the calendar. Attracting riders from around the world" (https://dirtyreiver.co.uk/)

"Entries have just opened. I'm sure they'll sell out quickly again." (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/1886zu5/dirty_reiver_2024/)

Entry cost: "£75... with even the 'baby' 65km version coming in at £60" (https://www.cyclingweekly.com/routes/7-tips-to-nail-your-first-gravel-event-taking-on-britains-dirty-reiver-challenge)

**Logistics Note:**

**Anonymous [RECREATIONAL]:** "Major gravel events, the Dirty Reiver included, often have camping attached, which makes for an excellent budget option that means you are pretty much on the start line as soon as you step out of your tent or camper." But warns to book accommodation early: "In an event with competitor numbers stretching into four figures, B&Bs quickly get booked up." (https://www.cyclingweekly.com/routes/7-tips-to-nail-your-first-gravel-event-taking-on-britains-dirty-reiver-challenge)
