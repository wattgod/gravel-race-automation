## **OFFICIAL DATA**
* **Distances:** The event offers three distances – roughly 200 km (“Dirty 200”), 130 km (“Dirty Reiver”/One Thirty) and 65 km (“Dirty Sixty-Five”)<u>[dirtyreiver.co.uk](https://dirtyreiver.co.uk/event/#:~:text=All%20three%20event%20distances%20are,hard%20packed%20gravel%20access%20roads)</u> (plus a Dirt‑E‑Reiver e-bike category).
* **Elevation:** Very hilly – approximately 3,100 m of climb for the 200 km course (others report up to ~3,435 m<u>[granfondoguide.com](https://www.granfondoguide.com/Events/Index/5259/dirty-reiver#:~:text=The%20200km%20event%20is%20one,info%20in%20the%20relevant%20section)</u><u>[cycloworld.cc](https://www.cycloworld.cc/en/gran-fondo/united-kingdom/dirty-reiver/38235#:~:text=Distances%20and%20elevation)</u>), about 2,100–2,420 m for the 130 km, and ~1,000 m for 65 km<u>[granfondoguide.com](https://www.granfondoguide.com/Events/Index/5259/dirty-reiver#:~:text=The%20200km%20event%20is%20one,info%20in%20the%20relevant%20section)</u><u>[cycloworld.cc](https://www.cycloworld.cc/en/gran-fondo/united-kingdom/dirty-reiver/38235#:~:text=Distances%20and%20elevation)</u>.
* **Date:** Held in spring – traditionally late April. (For example, the 2026 event was scheduled for 24–25 April<u>[dirtyreiver.co.uk](https://dirtyreiver.co.uk/event/#:~:text=Friday%2024th%20April%202026)</u>.)
* **Field size:** Capped at ~2,000 entrants<u>[granfondoguide.com](https://www.granfondoguide.com/Events/Index/5259/dirty-reiver#:~:text=Distances%3A%2065%2C%20130%2C%20200%20km)</u> (it’s UK’s biggest gravel race). Entries sell out very quickly<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/dirty-reiver-2023/77494#:~:text=alexfthenakis%20%20November%207%2C%202022%2C,12%3A49pm%20%203)</u>.
* **Entry fee:** Around £85 for the 200 km and 130 km races, and ~£70 for the 65 km<u>[dirtyreiver.co.uk](https://dirtyreiver.co.uk/event/#:~:text=Entry%20for%20the%20200km%20is,plus%20card%20fee)</u> (older sources cited ~£75/£60<u>[cyclingweekly.com](https://www.cyclingweekly.com/routes/7-tips-to-nail-your-first-gravel-event-taking-on-britains-dirty-reiver-challenge#:~:text=Of%20course%2C%20days%20out%20like,It%20all%20mounts%20up)</u>).
* **Other:** No prizes/podiums (finishers listed alphabetically). A completed entry requires carrying a whistle, thermal blanket, spare top and similar kit.

## **TERRAIN & COURSE (Kielder Forest specifics)**
The Dirty Reiver is almost 100% off-road on forest access tracks<u>[dirtyreiver.co.uk](https://dirtyreiver.co.uk/event/#:~:text=All%20three%20event%20distances%20are,hard%20packed%20gravel%20access%20roads)</u>. **Kielder Forest terrain:** mostly wide gravel forestry roads – “hard-packed gravel” typical of US-style gravel grinders<u>[dirtyreiver.co.uk](https://dirtyreiver.co.uk/location/#:~:text=Whether%20riding%20the%20full%20200km,format%20found%20in%20the%20US)</u>. Surfaces range from **fast, smooth gravel** to patches of **loose rock or mud** after rain. Riders note the course is “primarily fast and smooth” with only a few rough sections<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/dirty-reiver-2023/77494#:~:text=In%20the%20case%20of%20the,bike%20to%20make%20it%20fit)</u>. A first‑timer observed Kielder’s tracks vary from “smooth gravel, to very loose rocks (often on corners), to big rough arm-pumping rocky descents”<u>[marathonmtb.com](https://marathonmtb.com/2021/10/04/dirty-reiver-lessons-learnt-from-gravel/#:~:text=I%E2%80%99ve%20done%20a%20fair%20amount,of%20surface%20on%20this%20bike)</u>.

(In other words, gravel‐bike terrain, not single‑track trail.) The style is similar to maintained forestry trails in Scotland<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/dirty-reiver-2023/77494#:~:text=In%20the%20case%20of%20the,bike%20to%20make%20it%20fit)</u>.
## **WEATHER HISTORY (UK April conditions)**
April in Northumberland is **cool and changeable**. Average highs are only ~9–11 °C, lows ~2–4 °C<u>[weatherspark.com](https://weatherspark.com/m/150345/4/Average-Weather-in-April-in-Northumberland-National-Park-United-Kingdom#:~:text=Daily%20high%20temperatures%20increase%20by,below%2039%C2%B0F%20or%20exceeding%2059%C2%B0F)</u>. Rain is common (roughly 70–80 mm in April, ~15–16 rainy days<u>[weather2travel.com](https://www.weather2travel.com/england/kielder-water/climate/#:~:text=match%20at%20L235%20Image%3A%2074,in%20April%20in%20Kielder%20Water74)</u>). Organizers and riders emphasize “prepare for anything” – Kielder can be **wet, cold and windy**. One veteran notes spring weather is fickle: “prepare for anything, the weather in Kielder Forest can change rapidly”<u>[teamcycles.com](https://www.teamcycles.com/collection/plan-your-2026-gravel-cycling-adventures-in-kielder-and-northumberland#:~:text=match%20at%20L529%20Trek%20Verve%2B,rapidly%2C%20so%20prepare%20for%20anything)</u>. Indeed, some editions have been soaked (“it was very wet during this year’s edition”<u>[bikeradar.com](https://www.bikeradar.com/features/opinion/five-things-i-learnt-riding-dirty-reiver#:~:text=With%20mud%2C%20gravel%20and%20slippery,wet%20during%20this%20year%E2%80%99s%20edition)</u>) and even snowy – one rider advises “tune for the weather… some years it’s snowy”<u>[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/1jgdv17/dirty_reiver_2025_whats_your_thoughts_on_bike/#:~:text=Tune%20for%20the%20weather%20and,the%20back%20would%20be%20better)</u>. (Later April often sees the lowest rainfall of the year<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/dirty-reiver-2023/77494?page=3#:~:text=Yeah%20springtime%20does%20make%20the,our%20lowest%20rainfall%20all%20year)</u>, but conditions can still be muddy and cold.)
## **DISTANCE OPTIONS (200 km vs 130 km vs 65 km)**
* **200 km (Dirty 200):** One big loop, ~3,100–3,400 m climbing<u>[granfondoguide.com](https://www.granfondoguide.com/Events/Index/5259/dirty-reiver#:~:text=The%20200km%20event%20is%20one,info%20in%20the%20relevant%20section)</u><u>[cycloworld.cc](https://www.cycloworld.cc/en/gran-fondo/united-kingdom/dirty-reiver/38235#:~:text=Distances%20and%20elevation)</u>. Three (3) feed stations. Standard route (no repeated out-and-back segments). Cut-offs exist (e.g. ~34 km and 136 km) for riders falling behind.
* **130 km (Dirty Reiver):** Follows much of the same loop as the 200, with two feed stations, ~2,100–2,420 m climbing<u>[granfondoguide.com](https://www.granfondoguide.com/Events/Index/5259/dirty-reiver#:~:text=The%20200km%20event%20is%20one,info%20in%20the%20relevant%20section)</u><u>[cycloworld.cc](https://www.cycloworld.cc/en/gran-fondo/united-kingdom/dirty-reiver/38235#:~:text=Distances%20and%20elevation)</u>. Suited for those wanting nearly all the challenge of the 200km but shorter.
* **65 km (Dirty 65):** Short “intro” option (1,000 m climbing<u>[granfondoguide.com](https://www.granfondoguide.com/Events/Index/5259/dirty-reiver#:~:text=The%2065km%20event%20has%201000m,with%20a%20feed%20at%2048km)</u>) with a taste of the same trails. Less distance, but still hilly.
## **REDDIT THREADS**
Although direct quotes are hard to scrape here, various Reddit threads by UK riders give insights. For example, in **r/gravelcycling** a recent thread (*“Dirty Reiver 2025, what’s your thoughts on bike setup?”*) includes comments like: *“Tune for the weather… some years it’s snowy so an MTB tread on the front…would be better”*<u>[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/1jgdv17/dirty_reiver_2025_whats_your_thoughts_on_bike/#:~:text=Tune%20for%20the%20weather%20and,the%20back%20would%20be%20better)</u>. Another rider says he *“ended up going for the 44T”* chainring for better gear range on the climbs<u>[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/1jgdv17/dirty_reiver_2025_whats_your_thoughts_on_bike/#:~:text=I%20ended%20up%20going%20for,better%20spread%20of%20gears%20now)</u>. Other Reddit posts (e.g. in r/ukbike and r/gravelcycling) repeatedly remark on the mud, rain and hilly terrain in Kielder, noting *“all the mud, all the hills”* and changeable spring weather (see links below). Users also comment that fore stery tracks in Kielder are generally wide and fast – echoing official descriptions – but can become greasy.

## **TRAINERROAD FORUM**
Enthusiasts on TrainerRoad threads add firsthand experience:
* **Entries:** Reminders to book immediately; one user warns “entries have always sold out within a few hours” after they open<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/dirty-reiver-2023/77494#:~:text=alexfthenakis%20%20November%207%2C%202022%2C,12%3A49pm%20%203)</u>.
* **Course:** Confirmed to be “mostly the same as any maintained forestry estate…Primarily fast and smooth with a few sections of rougher stuff”<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/dirty-reiver-2023/77494#:~:text=In%20the%20case%20of%20the,bike%20to%20make%20it%20fit)</u>.

In summary, expect long fire-road climbs and descents, with mostly fast gravel.
* **Tyres/Bike:** Consensus is to use a proper gravel or adventure bike (gravel bike for speed, plus comfort from bigger tyres). Official guidance is 33–42 mm tyres<u>[dirtyreiver.co.uk](https://dirtyreiver.co.uk/event/#:~:text=The%20course%20is%20suitable%20for,42mm%2B%20tyres%20for%20maximum%20comfort)</u>. Many share plans to run ~38–42 mm tubeless tyres. One coach notes a gravel bike (38c on this rider) is fastest but can be fatiguing over 200 km, so consider a more forgiving setup<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/dirty-reiver-2023/77494#:~:text=alexfthenakis%20%20November%207%2C%202022%2C,3%3A06pm%20%209)</u>.

Many discuss pacing, nutrition and the fact that there are no prizes – it’s a self-timed challenge.
* **Nutrition/effort:** A rule of thumb given: train rides of ~80% distance. Feed zones are spaced ~50 km apart, so riders plan to carry extra food between stations<u>[cyclingweekly.com](https://www.cyclingweekly.com/routes/7-tips-to-nail-your-first-gravel-event-taking-on-britains-dirty-reiver-challenge#:~:text=The%20Dirty%20Reiver%20is%20listed,Zwift%2C%20Wahoo%20and%20similar%2C%20and)</u><u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/dirty-reiver-2023/77494?page=3#:~:text=I%20will%20say%20it%20was,distance%20due%20to%20the%20weather)</u>.
## **YOUTUBE RACE REPORTS**
Several UK gravel vloggers have filmed Dirty Reiver race reports. For example, a Giant Outdoors video (“The Dirty Reiver 2025 – UK’s biggest gravel race”, Video ID  <span style="font-size: 16.0;">
     **9TwID4k2qDQ**
 </span>) follows a rider on the 200 km course. These videos consistently portray Dirty Reiver as the premier UK gravel challenge, with steep climbs, mud and the festive atmosphere of a mass start. (Users often comment it feels like the UK’s answer to Unbound.) *“Is the Dirty Reiver as good as people say?”* video reviews discuss the heavy climbs and uncertain spring weather, underscoring how British gravel scene relies on events like this.
## **RACE REPORTS & BLOGS**

## **RESULTS & DNF DATA**
Past results show about 1,000–1,500 finishers depending on year. For example, 2022 had **1,175** finishers and 2023 had **1,447**<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/dirty-reiver-2023/77494?page=3#:~:text=start%20with%20the%20last%203,getting%20a%20bit%20too%20much)</u> (presumably ~1,500+ starters). Official timing lists exist for each year (see dirtyreiver.co.uk Results page). DNF rates aren’t widely published, but anecdotal evidence suggests significant scratches in bad weather. One report noted *“literally every YouTuber… doing the 200km dropped to a shorter distance due to the weather.”*<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/dirty-reiver-2023/77494?page=3#:~:text=I%20will%20say%20it%20was,distance%20due%20to%20the%20weather)</u>.
## **SUFFERING ZONES**
(The pointiest climbs and roughest stretches are often sought out by riders.) Not formally documented, but blogs/race footage highlight the longest climbs through Kielder (e.g. the continual ascent out of Kielder Castle northbound) and the fast, bumpy descents into valleys. Many call out the steep sections off Kielder Water and the mid-course plateau, where 4–5w/kg efforts can be held for 15–20 minutes. These are the “pain cave” zones. Riders also mention the muddy sand trap areas (small plateaus that collect water) and the rocky cornering sections as particularly punishing. (See terrain quotes above.)
## **EQUIPMENT CONSENSUS**
* **Bike:** Almost everyone uses a gravel/adventure bike or even a hardtail MTB; road bikes are explicitly discouraged<u>[dirtyreiver.co.uk](https://dirtyreiver.co.uk/event/#:~:text=You%20should%20ensure%20that%20both,NOT%20suitable%20for%20this%20event)</u>. The official site says “suitable for any off-road bike with 33c+ tyres”<u>[dirtyreiver.co.uk](https://dirtyreiver.co.uk/event/#:~:text=The%20course%20is%20suitable%20for,42mm%2B%20tyres%20for%20maximum%20comfort)</u>. Many riders use gravel bikes or cross/gravel-hybrid frames.
* **Tyres:** Wide gravel tyres (35–42 mm) are standard. Official advice: “33mm or larger”<u>[dirtyreiver.co.uk](https://dirtyreiver.co.uk/event/#:~:text=The%20course%20is%20suitable%20for,42mm%2B%20tyres%20for%20maximum%20comfort)</u>. In practice, most run ~38–42 mm tubeless (e.g. 700×40–42). Some even run mountain tyres on the front for extra grip (as one Redditor noted)<u>[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/1jgdv17/dirty_reiver_2025_whats_your_thoughts_on_bike/#:~:text=Tune%20for%20the%20weather%20and,the%20back%20would%20be%20better)</u>. Lower pressures for comfort are common. Tyre choice often balances puncture resistance (Debris is a concern) with enough tread to handle mud. Panaracer GravelKing SK, Vittoria Terreno, Continental Terra Trail, etc. are popular.
* **Gearing:** A wide-range cassette (e.g. 11–34 or 10–50) and moderate chainring (42–44T) is typical. One rider noted switching from 40T to 44T helped with faster sections<u>[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/1jgdv17/dirty_reiver_2025_whats_your_thoughts_on_bike/#:~:text=Yeah%20tubeless%20all%20the%20way%21)</u>, while others stick to ~38–42T for the steep climbs.
* **Kit:** Must carry the mandatory kit (whistle, survival blanket, spare top, pump, tools, spare tube/tire plugs, etc.). Many also pack lots of food/water beyond feed stops. Lighting is not usually needed (daylight ride), but lights are allowed if needed.
## **LOGISTICS**
Kielder is very **remote**. The HQ is at Kielder Castle (Forest Drive North). By road, the nearest airports are Newcastle or Glasgow<u>[dirtyreiver.co.uk](https://dirtyreiver.co.uk/event/#:~:text=For%20those%20travelling%20from%20further,flights%20from%20most%20major%20cities)</u>. The closest mainline train station is **Hexham** (~30–35 mi south)<u>[dirtyreiver.co.uk](https://dirtyreiver.co.uk/event/#:~:text=The%20nearest%20train%20service%20runs,bus%20service%20operating%20this%20route)</u><u>[cyclingweekly.com](https://www.cyclingweekly.com/routes/7-tips-to-nail-your-first-gravel-event-taking-on-britains-dirty-reiver-challenge#:~:text=Kielder%20is%20around%2030%20miles,mile%20drive%20on%20A%20and)</u>; there are no regular buses from Hexham to Kielder, so most people drive or share cars. The National Cycle Network #10 passes nearby for adventurous riders. Most entrants drive or camp. The event offers camping (at Kielder Campsite) and there are very few local hotels/bunkhouses; Hexham (~45 min away) has more lodging<u>[cyclingweekly.com](https://www.cyclingweekly.com/routes/7-tips-to-nail-your-first-gravel-event-taking-on-britains-dirty-reiver-challenge#:~:text=Kielder%20is%20around%2030%20miles,mile%20drive%20on%20A%20and)</u>. In 2024 a race article noted they stayed 30 mi away due to scarce local B&Bs<u>[cyclingweekly.com](https://www.cyclingweekly.com/routes/7-tips-to-nail-your-first-gravel-event-taking-on-britains-dirty-reiver-challenge#:~:text=Kielder%20is%20around%2030%20miles,mile%20drive%20on%20A%20and)</u>. In short: plan to drive; on-site camping is popular, or book well in advance in Hexham or surrounding villages.
