## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Surface composition:** "The terrain includes everything from hard-packed dirt roads to loose gravel sections" with approximately 90% gravel and 10% paved road (https://brag.org/dirty-sheets-bicycle-ride-guide/)

**Route characteristics:** "The route features approximately 90% gravel and 10% paved road, most of which is at the very beginning." Described as "5% Singletrack" with "no singletrack but it does parallel singletrack in Cochran Mill Park" (https://www.mtbproject.com/trail/7012793/dirty-sheets-gravel-loop)

**Specific hazards:** "Some gravel packed and other loose. When on main road ride near fence." (https://www.mtbproject.com/trail/7012793/dirty-sheets-gravel-loop)

**Paved section strategy:** "It is recommended you download and follow the gpx file or use the MTB Project mobile app on your first ride, as there are several intersecting gravel roads you'll pass. When you reach South Fulton Parkway, at around mile 12, turn to the left and go around the gate, then cut through the trees and follow the shoulder of South Fulton Parkway downhill for two-tenths of a mile to paved Garrett's Fy on the right" (https://www.mtbproject.com/trail/7012793/dirty-sheets-gravel-loop)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Event character:** "Think of it as Silk Sheets' unruly counterpart—less refined, more rugged, and 100% unapologetic" (https://www.granfondoguide.com/Events/Index/12001/dirty-sheets-gravel-grind)

**Course description:** "It's not polished. It's not easy. But tucked between the beatdown climbs and muddy crossings, you'll find wide-open pastures, crooked fences, and big-sky moments that make the effort worth it. If you're into Type 2 fun and courses with bite, Dirty Sheets doesn't disappoint." (https://www.granfondoguide.com/Events/Index/12001/dirty-sheets-gravel-grind)

**Location context:** "Located just 30 minutes south of downtown Atlanta" - "about 30 minutes south—where the drone of the interstate fades into the rustle of tall grass, the crackle of gravel, and the occasional whiff of honeysuckle on the breeze" (https://www.granfondoguide.com/Events/Index/12001/dirty-sheets-gravel-grind)

**Proceeds:** "Proceeds go to MTB Atlanta to build and maintain all that we're working on and will be working on" (https://www.granfondoguide.com/Events/Index/12001/dirty-sheets-gravel-grind)

**Post-ride:** "Post ride food, drinks and entertainment—of course—enough to make you happy and then some" with "plenty of vegetarian and meat options, sides, fruit, chips, and snacks. Each registered rider will get two trips through the food line and three trips through the beverage line." (https://www.granfondoguide.com/Events/Index/12001/dirty-sheets-gravel-grind)

**Name origin:** "Why is it called Dirty Sheets? This area is very popular with road riders in Metro Atlanta and is know as Silk Sheets. The gravel version of this ride is obviously the dirty sheets." (https://www.mtbproject.com/trail/7012793/dirty-sheets-gravel-loop)

**Solitary riding experience [UNKNOWN]:** "great Monday ride! Nobody around but me and the cows!" (https://www.mtbproject.com/trail/7012793/dirty-sheets-gravel-loop)
