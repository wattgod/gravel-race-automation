# DUNOON DIRT DASH — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Brett Cotter [UNKNOWN]:** "My name is Brett Cotter, and in full disclosure, I'm not the fastest or most skilled rider, but I have a love and passion for 'all things bike' and where they take us physically and metaphorically... I knew absolutely nothing about the surrounding region, affectionately called Scotland's 'Adventure Coast' or the route where we would be riding through, but the unknown is part of the thrill." (https://bikepacking.com/news/2024-dunoon-dirt-dash-recap/)

**Brett Cotter [UNKNOWN]:** "The first day provided so much inspiration with a great mix of chatting with fellow riders along the singletrack, gravel tracks, forestry roads, and quiet roads. Having a Kiwi accent was an easy conversation starter, and I had people constantly ask me if I had travelled from New Zealand specifically for this. 'You bet,' I responded." (https://bikepacking.com/news/2024-dunoon-dirt-dash-recap/)

**Brett Cotter [UNKNOWN]:** "On the final descent to Loch Goil, our destination, the campsite with the imposing and dramatic lochside 14th-century Carrick Castle came into view. Nestled beside the Loch, the castle made a spectacular site to ride towards. After setting up our tents, there weren't too many people keen to jump in the Loch and have a swim, but I braved the cold temperature and relished the view out over the Loch." (https://bikepacking.com/news/2024-dunoon-dirt-dash-recap/)

**Anonymous rider [UNKNOWN]:** "That whole area is a dream to ride as it's a continuous stream of mountain and loch epic views 🤘." (https://dirtdash.cc/dunoon/)

**Anonymous rider [UNKNOWN]:** "Being able to bike every hill rather than having hike a bike was excellent." (https://dirtdash.cc/dunoon/)

**Anonymous rider [UNKNOWN]:** "Excellent event, thanks to everyone involved from organisers to fellow participants!" (https://dirtdash.cc/dunoon/)

**Markus Stitz (co-organiser) [UNKNOWN]:** "One thing that stood out for me this year is that we had a really nice mix of riders at all our events. While Dunoon has established itself as our main event in Scotland now, the Lezyne Cateran Dirt Dash was also really well received in the first year. We have made good progress attracting more women to ride the Dirt Dashes and we will continue to make the events more inclusive." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-photo-essay-from-the-2023-dunoon-dirt-dash)

**Charlie (co-organiser) [UNKNOWN]:** "I have talked and coerced Markus Stitz away from his normal thing of doing more mad miles in a day than most people do in a month... to 80 something over two days. It won't be easy-peasey, but it won't make you think about taking up golf or some other pointless excuse for avoiding adventure." (https://bikepacking.com/news/surly-dunoon-dirt-dash-gravel-event/)

More climbing at Hell's Glen, which is officially named 'Glen Iarainn,' which in Gaelic means 'the Iron Glen,' but sounds like the nearby Glen Ifhrinn which means 'the Glen of Hell.'"
