# DUSTY BANDITA — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Stella Hobbs [ELITE]:** "The whole point is the camaraderie and the shared experience doing something hard. Everyone is looking for belonging, particularly when it's wherever your heart is." (https://www.seeleylake.com/story/2025/06/19/sports/dusty-banditas-bike-race-swarms-ovando-for-the-third-time/11143.html)

**Brittney Banks [UNKNOWN], first-time 45-miler:** "I went into the race feeling grateful. The gratitude mindset helped me get through the race. I found out that going downhill was my favorite." (https://www.seeleylake.com/story/2025/06/19/sports/dusty-banditas-bike-race-swarms-ovando-for-the-third-time/11143.html)

**Emily Wilding [UNKNOWN], Idaho Falls group rider:** "We came (to Dusty Bandita) because it's beautiful and amazing and biking is good for mid-life crisis. We've been riding together for about 15 years. We like women's only races because there's more camaraderie." (https://www.seeleylake.com/story/2025/06/19/sports/dusty-banditas-bike-race-swarms-ovando-for-the-third-time/11143.html)

**strangerin_thealps [RECREATIONAL]:** "My first race, first group ride, longest ride, biggest day of climbing, and my best pace for comparable training rides... I was so nervous and convinced I couldn't complete this race. Besides my chain getting thrown quite a few times, this was a relatively moderate ride for me and I beat my own goal of coming in second to last place! 25/31... Mile 0 has been the hardest during training and it was on race day too." (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/140c9f9/my_first_race_first_group_ride_longest_ride/)

**Two Wheeled Inspiration blogger [ELITE]:** "My favorite part of this race was the finish line, which was not visible until you were nearly there. The very last quarter mile of the race was up a slight hill and the finish line was hidden around a corner in the heart of the town square. When you finally crested the hill and came around the corner, there were hoards of people gathered in the town square to watch finishers. There was applause, inflatables surrounding the timing equipment, and an announcer who made me feel like I had just finished in first place." (https://2wheeledinspiration.com/2023/06/23/the-dusty-bandita-a-race-review/)

**Bri Lui [ELITE], race founder:** "The journey itself started with Intimidation. The lack of confidence and fear of not knowing what I was doing, whether it be my first, 3rd or 10th race, while being surrounded by men who definitely looked like they knew what they were doing... It felt a bit lonely and I eventually became curious to see if I could at least try and change that." (https://www.roadbikerider.com/dusty-bandita-interview-bri-lui/)

**Carolyne Whelen [UNKNOWN], motorcycle race leader:** "It's really amazing when people learn new skills, especially as adults. Even though conditions with the weather were beautiful, this is not an easy course for first-timers." (https://www.seeleylake.com/story/2025/06/19/sports/dusty-banditas-bike-race-swarms-ovando-for-the-third-time/11143.html)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Gravel quality:** The race is "almost 100% gravel" with only the Highway 200 crossing being paved.

(https://www.roadbikerider.com/dusty-bandita-interview-bri-lui/)

**Wildlife presence:** One reviewer noted "the huge pile of [bear] scat on the ascent to the second aid station. They were most definitely in the area!" (https://2wheeledinspiration.com/2023/06/23/the-dusty-bandita-a-race-review/)

(https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/140c9f9/my_first_race_first_group_ride_longest_ride/)

**Rider safety behavior:** One reviewer noted "the significant number of women who opted to stop in the middle of roads or on blind corners to chat or address mechanical issues... on the descent from the race course summit, where there wasn't much room or visibility for riders coming up from behind. They were oblivious to the danger they were putting themselves in." (https://2wheeledinspiration.com/2023/06/23/the-dusty-bandita-a-race-review/)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Inclusivity focus:** "The Dusty Bandita is more than a women+ gravel bike race— it's a bold claim on space in a male-dominated sport, daring women+ (when we say women, that word always includes trans women) to go beyond their limits with a smirk of determination and a whole lot of grit." (https://www.thedustybandita.com/)

**Finish line energy:** "There were hoards of people gathered in the town square to watch finishers. There was applause, inflatables surrounding the timing equipment, and an announcer who made me feel like I had just finished in first place. Inclusivity and support were some of the reasons this race was founded, and I definitely felt both throughout event, but especially at the finish line." (https://2wheeledinspiration.com/2023/06/23/the-dusty-bandita-a-race-review/)

**Local community support:** Ovando resident Peggy Fly: "They're so excited when they get here and have a great time." Howie Fly: "It's good for business and to show people we're here."

**Post-race amenities:** All finishers receive a Dusty Bandita bandana and stainless steel coffee mug. Post-race lunch ticket included (important given limited dining in Ovando). Chef Liz Kenyon provides post-race food. (https://2wheeledinspiration.com/2023/06/23/the-dusty-bandita-a-race-review/ and https://www.bikesignup.com/Race/MT/Ovando/TheDustyBandita)

And, we all know that women face steeper challenges in professional cycling." (https://www.thedustybandita.com/)
