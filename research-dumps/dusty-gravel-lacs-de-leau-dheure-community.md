# DUSTY GRAVEL - LACS DE L'EAU D'HEURE — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Event Overview & Routes

The Dusty Gravel Lacs de l'Eau d'Heure is the second round of the five-race Dusty Gravel Series in Belgium. The event takes place on the Saturday before the UCI Gran Fondo Belgium (which occurs on Sunday). 

**Two distance options:**
- **L format:** 70-75 km with 1,000m D+ (9:00 AM start)
- **XL format:** 96-110 km with 1,500m D+ (9:30 AM start)

The start/finish is located at the Plate Taille dam at the Lacs de l'Eau d'Heure. According to the organization, "the region around the Lacs de l'Eau d'Heure is not known for its gravel roads," yet they managed to create routes that pleased participants (https://www.vojomag.nl/dusty-gravel-2025-cerfontaine-strijd-rond-de-lacs-de-leau-dheure/).

**Course structure (XL):** A 54 km loop, then two additional 21 km loops. The shorter distance does one 21 km loop (https://www.vojomag.nl/dusty-gravel-2025-cerfontaine-strijd-rond-de-lacs-de-leau-dheure/).

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Early race:** "After a couple of kilometers on the road to stretch out the peloton, the first gravel sections arrive... and immediately we already see the first technical problems, mainly flat tires" (https://www.vojomag.nl/dusty-gravel-2025-cerfontaine-strijd-rond-de-lacs-de-leau-dheure/).

**Technical singletrack:** "For some fun, for others too technical: this technical singletrack with lots of roots along the edge of the lake caused tongues to wag. Beautiful it certainly is" (https://www.vojomag.nl/dusty-gravel-2025-cerfontaine-strijd-rond-de-lacs-de-leau-dheure/).

**Surface mix:** The gravel sections were interspersed with asphalt, "but also with some beautiful sections through the forest" (https://www.vojomag.nl/dusty-gravel-2025-cerfontaine-strijd-rond-de-lacs-de-leau-dheure/).

**The shorter loops:** "The second loop may be shorter, but it is littered with small bumps that hurt the legs! Maximum concentration is required to take this kind of tight corners on a dry surface, before you know it you slide away here and end up on the ground" (https://www.vojomag.nl/dusty-gravel-2025-cerfontaine-strijd-rond-de-lacs-de-leau-dheure/).

## Weather Experienced

**2025 edition:** "And this time the promised layer of dust was indeed present!" Unlike the Andenne race the week before, dust was a factor this time. The description mentions "tight corners on a dry surface" requiring maximum concentration (https://www.vojomag.nl/dusty-gravel-2025-cerfontaine-strijd-rond-de-lacs-de-leau-dheure/).

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**[ELITE/COMPETITIVE level race dynamics — 2025 XL race]**

The race broke apart early: "After about twenty kilometers, a quartet broke away from the rest of the peloton. Owen Valcke, Steven Dillen, Kamiel Notebaert and Sander Hubrechts already counted almost a minute's lead" (https://www.vojomag.nl/dusty-gravel-2025-cerfontaine-strijd-rond-de-lacs-de-leau-dheure/).

By mid-race, "the same four men are still riding at the front. A dozen riders are chasing, but are more than two and a half minutes behind" (https://www.vojomag.nl/dusty-gravel-2025-cerfontaine-strijd-rond-de-lacs-de-leau-dheure/).

The second (shorter) loops proved decisive: "When entering the last round, there were still three left at the front. The pace was too high for Steven Dillen" (https://www.vojomag.nl/dusty-gravel-2025-cerfontaine-strijd-rond-de-lacs-de-leau-dheure/).

## DNF Risk Factors

**Flat tires:** Multiple riders experienced flats in the opening kilometers on the first gravel sections (https://www.vojomag.nl/dusty-gravel-2025-cerfontaine-strijd-rond-de-lacs-de-leau-dheure/).

**Technical crashes:** The rooty singletrack and tight corners on dry surfaces were identified as crash risks requiring "maximum concentration" (https://www.vojomag.nl/dusty-gravel-2025-cerfontaine-strijd-rond-de-lacs-de-leau-dheure/).

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

The event is marketed as "suitable for all enthusiasts" promising "a challenge that will live up to your expectations, whether you're looking for performance or simply pleasure on two wheels." The weekend brings together approximately 3,000 cyclists across both the Saturday gravel event and Sunday's Gran Fondo, "sharing unique moments in a friendly atmosphere" (https://www.dustygravelseries.be/en/grandfondo).

The Dusty Gravel Series is described as "an unprecedented Gravel challenge in Belgium with 5 races from April to September" with "2 distances at each event, for all levels." The series includes a points system where participants can "accumulate points and climb the official ranking while pushing your limits" (https://www.le-sportif.com/calendrier/215995/dusty-gravel-lacs-de-l-eau-d-heure-2025-froidchapelle/gravel/).

**Note on 2025 Sunday event:** The Gran Fondo Belgium on the day after the gravel race "completely fell apart after a massive crash shortly after the start and the chaos that followed forced the organization to stop the event" (https://www.vojomag.nl/dusty-gravel-2025-cerfontaine-strijd-rond-de-lacs-de-leau-dheure/).
