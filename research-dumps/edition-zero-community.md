## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Caleb Bottcher [ELITE]:** "My plan there was just to be dropping my Camelbak. I'd still have two bottles and full pockets. When I got there my mind blanked. I still had the bag clipped up and the hose strapped across me." (https://www.nzcyclingjournal.com/inside-edition-zero/)

**Caleb Bottcher [ELITE]:** "In an eight hour race, there's going to be dark patches, and there's lots of time to think, so how you shape that has a huge impact. Bad things are going to happen in that time, so it's how you manage those moments and your reactions to them which is what matters." (https://www.nzcyclingjournal.com/inside-edition-zero/)

**Caleb Bottcher [ELITE]:** "George pulled a turn, I pulled a turn, and then no-one pulled through after me. I didn't want to look back, but I glanced under my shoulder and there was no-one there…I just thought, 'you guys are going to regret that', and started turning the screw." Attacked solo with 130km remaining. (https://www.nzcyclingjournal.com/inside-edition-zero/)

**George Bennett [ELITE]:** "My biggest fear was getting a puncture early on and being stuck riding on my own. I was shitting it about riding 250 kilometres on gravel. No matter what, no matter how fit you are or where you're riding, being on a bike that long is hard." (https://www.nzcyclingjournal.com/inside-edition-zero/)

**George Bennett [ELITE]:** "When we hit the first feed zone, I didn't realise the pace that we'd go through those at and I dropped into the third group coming out of it. After that the race was on." (https://www.nzcyclingjournal.com/inside-edition-zero/)

**Anonymous rider [RECREATIONAL]:** "Strange things happen in one's mind when the distances are that long. Whilst the 70km to the first bag drop seemed to, and in fact did, take hours, once I reached the second and final bag drop, I felt that I was nearly home even though there was still 80km left to ride." (https://www.climbbikeski.com/2025/12/12/edition-zero-gravel-2025/)

**Anonymous rider [RECREATIONAL]:** "I had been coughing the previous day but as I had slept reasonably well (after taking a Lemsip) I wasn't sure if I was suffering from pre-race health paranoia, hay-fever or was genuinely sick." (https://www.climbbikeski.com/2025/12/12/edition-zero-gravel-2025/)

**Anonymous rider [RECREATIONAL]:** "As the terrain became lumpier I started to feel the odd pre-cramp twinge from repeated efforts to close gaps over the tops of the punchy ascents. On a gravel climb after c.50kms a gap started to widen, and by the end of the subsequent descent the group was gone." (https://www.climbbikeski.com/2025/12/12/edition-zero-gravel-2025/)

**Anonymous rider [RECREATIONAL]:** "I had been feeling bloated for the last couple of hours and was really craving something that wasn't sugary." (https://www.climbbikeski.com/2025/12/12/edition-zero-gravel-2025/)

**Charlotte Clarke [COMPETITIVE]:** "I wasn't really expecting to spend so much of the race alone. It was a bit nerve wracking not knowing what the race situation was like behind me, but I stayed calm and backed myself. I used my knowledge of the roads to my advantage - knowing where to push the pace, and where I could back it off and recover a bit." (https://charlottelucyclarke.substack.com/p/edition-zero-gravel-2025)

**Charlotte Clarke [COMPETITIVE]:** "With around 5km to go, I was caught by a group including Michaela and I had to adapt the plan. She sent a super strong attack into the final descent of the day and I chased her back down. I made the decision to back myself in the sprint, and just like that all 247km of racing came down to a dramatic sprint finish." Won back-to-back in 2024/2025. (https://charlottelucyclarke.substack.com/p/edition-zero-gravel-2025)

**Anonymous rider [RECREATIONAL]:** "As we entered the velodrome for two laps before the finish, Gus, the MC, was trying goad us into a sprint but we decided to cross the finish line together. It was satisfying to complete such a hard course and nice to ride and finish it together. It felt like a mountain bike pairs stage race stage in that regard." (https://www.climbbikeski.com/2025/12/12/edition-zero-gravel-2025/)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Indoor Training Setup [RECREATIONAL]:** Elite Suito-T smart trainer recommended as go-to option. For more realistic experience, Tacx NEO 2T with motion plates. Both come with 1-month free Zwift subscription. (https://www.pushbikes.co.nz/blogs/news/edition-zero-gravel-race)

**Cold Weather Gear [RECREATIONAL]:** Pearl Izumi thermal leg and arm warmers (fleece lined with reflective logos), Madison range of waterproof jackets, Niterider lights for early morning visibility. (https://www.pushbikes.co.nz/blogs/news/edition-zero-gravel-race)

**Mandatory Equipment [ALL LEVELS]:** All Mains and Entree riders must carry one emergency blanket large enough to completely shelter in. Emergency bivi blankets available for purchase at expo. (https://www.greatkiwigravel.com/post/edition-zero-2025-newsletter-one)

**Bike Setup Note [RECREATIONAL]:** One rider noted "criminally mismatching my tyres" before the race, suggesting tire choice is flexible. Fresh tires recommended. (https://charlottelucyclarke.substack.com/p/edition-zero-gravel-2025)

## Weather Experienced

**2022 Event:** "2022 we had snow on one side of the course and bright sunshine on the other!" (https://www.greatkiwigravel.com/post/edition-zero-2025-newsletter-one)

**Pre-2025 Training Ride:** "The wind was absolutely insane - by far the windiest conditions I've ever ridden in (Wind - 12?? Char - 0). I'm pretty sure the local farmers having a laugh in their ute were thoroughly entertained by our struggles - watching Caleb hobble across the road clutching a bike that wouldn't stay upright, and me pinned by the wind against a fence, hanging on for dear life... We did, however, get a glorious 60 km/h tailwind between Albury and Cave." (https://charlottelucyclarke.substack.com/p/edition-zero-gravel-2025)

**2024 Event Conditions [ELITE]:** "As we ground our way up to the pass Zoe dropped back but I figured that she would catch us on the descent, which was indeed the case. This was the nicest section of the ride. 20km of tailwind and gravity assisted fun on a smooth gravel road... 50km from the finish we turned east, hit the gravel again, lost the cooling affect of the head/cross-wind." Strong westerly headwind on climbs, tailwind on Hakataramea descent. (https://www.climbbikeski.com/2025/12/12/edition-zero-gravel-2025/)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Course Surface Composition:** "72% of the Main (about 180km) was on gravel roads. In general these comprised of fast secure gravel or hard packed dirt, but over the course of the ride we were also treated to freshly laid, deep slow gravel... unexpectedly deep gravel that you wouldn't notice until your bike started to fishtail on a descent, gravel spiced up with rocks, and numerous stream crossings that required one to ride over rounded wet slippery stones." (https://www.climbbikeski.com/2025/12/12/edition-zero-gravel-2025/)

**Early Course Challenge [RECREATIONAL]:** "The worst part of this [deep, freshly graded gravel] was on a section near the start of the route that Lill and the other riders of the Snack had to cover it in both directions" - approximately 25km in. (https://www.climbbikeski.com/2025/12/12/edition-zero-gravel-2025/)

**Mackenzie Pass [RECREATIONAL]:** "An excruciating straight headwind section led to the pass. I remembered from the overall route profile that there was a climb, followed by a descent to a higher climb that would take us to our high point of the day. As we had just completed a double-headed ascent, I thought that we had now crested that high-point. I was expecting a long, tailwind assisted, downhill then flat section all the way to the final climb. Sadly, reality had something different in store for us." (https://www.climbbikeski.com/2025/12/12/edition-zero-gravel-2025/)

**Mackenzie Pass Details [ELITE]:** "The first major obstacle was the Mackenzie pass, a four kilometre climb with an average gradient of 6.3%." (https://www.nzcyclingjournal.com/inside-edition-zero/)

**Hakataramea Pass [RECREATIONAL]:** "The descent from Mackenzie was directly into the wind – Ant did sterling work pulling us along – and then after a drinks stop (at km 125, only half way round!) we turned south and and I found that we had the even higher Hakataramea climb was still to come." Gentle climbing with heavier gravel, felt harder than it looked due to heat and no drafting benefit. (https://www.climbbikeski.com/2025/12/12/edition-zero-gravel-2025/)

**Meyers Pass [RECREATIONAL]:** "50km from the finish we turned east, hit the gravel again, lost the cooling affect of the head/cross-wind and started the final big climb over Myers Pass... We decided to take it easy and not risk a puncture or a crash, as Ant had experienced a side-wall puncture on the descent previously." Rocky descent. (https://www.climbbikeski.com/2025/12/12/edition-zero-gravel-2025/)

**Stream Crossings:** Multiple ford crossings throughout. "We had a couple of minor crashes in the fords we crossed, one involving Ant. He mentioned that sitting in the cold water helped the cramp he was starting to suffer from." (https://www.climbbikeski.com/2025/12/12/edition-zero-gravel-2025/)

**Final Section:** One final pass a few kilometers from Waimate before the velodrome finish. Two lap finish on the historic 1891 velodrome. (https://www.climbbikeski.com/2025/12/12/edition-zero-gravel-2025/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Feed Zone Strategy [ELITE]:** Feed zones operate more like triathlon transitions than road race neutral zones - the race does NOT slow down. George Bennett was caught out: "When we hit the first feed zone, I didn't realise the pace that we'd go through those at and I dropped into the third group coming out of it." Practice your feed zone execution. (https://www.nzcyclingjournal.com/inside-edition-zero/)

**Early Race Positioning [ELITE]:** Caleb Bottcher's fumbled first feed zone drop nearly ended his race. After recovering to the lead group: "Having to go so deep so early was not good, but I talked myself out of it. The other guys have maybe had a bit of a nicer, smoother effort, but everyone's had to do something that's not ideal." (https://www.nzcyclingjournal.com/inside-edition-zero/)

**Solo Breakaway Strategy [ELITE]:** Bottcher attacked with 130km remaining after sensing weakness: "George pulled a turn, I pulled a turn, and then no-one pulled through after me... I just thought, 'you guys are going to regret that', and started turning the screw." His attack came before the three main climbs. "I'd run a couple of scenarios in my head before the race…It wasn't Plan A, but if an opportunity arose, I wasn't going to turn it down. Morale was a bit low; no-one pulled a turn after me… I just decided to take it on." (https://www.nzcyclingjournal.com/inside-edition-zero/)

**Nutrition Planning [RECREATIONAL]:** One rider pre-loaded at 3am with "rice, brown sugar, pancakes, and sauce, plus a bottle of orange juice" then returned to bed until 4am. By late race: "I had been feeling bloated for the last couple of hours and was really craving something that wasn't sugary." Potato chips at final aid station provided relief. (https://www.climbbikeski.com/2025/12/12/edition-zero-gravel-2025/ and https://charlottelucyclarke.substack.com/p/edition-zero-gravel-2025)

**Group Riding Dynamics [RECREATIONAL]:** Early pace along sealed sections split the field quickly. Groups of ~10 riders formed and worked together on windy sections. Value of staying with a group for wind protection, but must be able to close gaps on punchy climbs or risk being dropped. (https://www.climbbikeski.com/2025/12/12/edition-zero-gravel-2025/)

**Local Knowledge Advantage [COMPETITIVE]:** Charlotte Clarke: "I used my knowledge of the roads to my advantage - knowing where to push the pace, and where I could back it off and recover a bit." She trains regularly on the first half of the route. (https://charlottelucyclarke.substack.com/p/edition-zero-gravel-2025)

**Mental Management [ELITE]:** Bottcher on the mental challenge: "In an eight hour race, there's going to be dark patches, and there's lots of time to think, so how you shape that has a huge impact. Bad things are going to happen in that time, so it's how you manage those moments and your reactions to them which is what matters." (https://www.nzcyclingjournal.com/inside-edition-zero/)

**Navigation Requirements:** Mains and Entree courses require GPS navigation - they are NOT fully marked with signs. Snack and Taster have signage but GPS still recommended. "DO NOT use any files from 2022, 2023 or 2024. The best GPX file is a fresh GPX file!" (https://www.greatkiwigravel.com/post/edition-zero-2025-newsletter-one)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Mechanical Vulnerability [ELITE]:** George Bennett's primary fear: "My biggest fear was getting a puncture early on and being stuck riding on my own." The course's remoteness (no towns, 240km) means mechanical issues are race-ending without self-sufficiency. (https://www.nzcyclingjournal.com/inside-edition-zero/)

**Feed Zone Execution [ELITE]:** Poor feed zone transitions can destroy race positioning. Both Bennett and Bottcher were nearly eliminated from contention by first feed zone mistakes. (https://www.nzcyclingjournal.com/inside-edition-zero/)

**Cramp Risk [RECREATIONAL]:** Multiple reports of cramping in final sections. "At the final drink stop (after the descent of Myers Pass) Ant stopped to stretch out his cramping quads." Cold water fords provided some relief. (https://www.climbbikeski.com/2025/12/12/edition-zero-gravel-2025/)

**Puncture Risk on Descents:** Meyers Pass descent specifically mentioned as puncture/crash risk - rocky surface. Previous rider experienced sidewall puncture on this descent. (https://www.climbbikeski.com/2025/12/12/edition-zero-gravel-2025/)

**Illness Management [RECREATIONAL]:** Pre-race illness nearly caused a DNS: "I had been coughing the previous day... I was almost begging Ant to agree that we should ride separately as I was reasonably confident that if I paced it well I could complete the course." Shows the event attracts riders even when not at 100%. (https://www.climbbikeski.com/2025/12/12/edition-zero-gravel-2025/)

**Course Isolation:** Event founder Andy Chalmers: "It's 250 kilometres with no towns. There are smatterings of dairy farms, but it's limited to the very start and end of the course." All roads are open to traffic including locals, tractors, and stock. Mandatory emergency blanket requirement reflects serious remoteness. (https://greatkiwigravel.com/post/edition-zero-2025-newsletter-one and https://www.nzcyclingjournal.com/inside-edition-zero/)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Event Philosophy:** Founder Andy Chalmers: "Andy is insistent that the primary reason for the event, its rurality, and its difficulty, is that the challenge helps to forge a community. But, when you put a load of people together on bikes and point to a finish line, you've got a race." (https://www.nzcyclingjournal.com/inside-edition-zero/)

**Velodrome Finish Atmosphere:** "As we entered the velodrome for two laps before the finish, Gus, the MC, was trying goad us into a sprint... The atmosphere inside the velodrome with the crowd was unreal." (https://www.climbbikeski.com/2025/12/12/edition-zero-gravel-2025/ and https://charlottelucyclarke.substack.com/p/edition-zero-gravel-2025)

**Post-Race Scene:** "The post-race vibes were immaculate. Everyone was buzzing, and everyone had a story to tell. Prizegiving was super cool - the medals had the course elevation profile on them, such a detailed touch - and the pink winner's jerseys were absolutely stunning. The celebrations carried on at the afterparty." (https://charlottelucyclarke.substack.com/p/edition-zero-gravel-2025)

**Friday Expo:** "During event registration we have the EZG Expo going down. The expo is full of cycling brands, vendors and locals setting up to meet you, have some fun (goodies and giveaways aplenty) and share in the welcome that EZG is known for. Do not miss it." Opens 3pm Friday, registration 3-8pm. (https://www.greatkiwigravel.com/post/edition-zero-2025-newsletter-one)

**Growing Prestige [ELITE]:** "This year it was very evident that people had targeted it. It wasn't just another race on their calendar. It was something they were putting specific effort towards." George Bennett's last-minute entry added to the field quality. (https://www.nzcyclingjournal.com/inside-edition-zero/)

**Historical Connection:** "Waimate has a rich cycling heritage. Far from a tribute to Roubaix's velodrome, Waimate's was built in 1891, five years before the first edition of Paris-Roubaix... Between 1930 and 1950 the town hosted the start of the annual 233km race from Waimate to Christchurch." Event founder: "we had this town with this rich cycling history." (https://www.nzcyclingjournal.com/inside-edition-zero/)

**Unsupported Format:** "Given this is an adventure and people are travelling from all over to attend, this event is strictly unsupported. This means that there is no personal on course support. No one other than official event staff will be allowed into the Aid Stations!" (https://www.greatkiwigravel.com/post/edition-zero-2025-newsletter-one)

**Zero Tolerance on Littering:** "Littering of any kind is totally unacceptable! There will be rubbish bags for you at the aid stations and finish village, otherwise be sensible and respectful, carry all your rubbish with you!" (https://www.greatkiwigravel.com/post/edition-zero-2025-newsletter-one)
