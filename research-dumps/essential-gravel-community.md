# ESSENTIAL GRAVEL — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Anonymous rider [UNKNOWN]:** "This ride was a great distance, easy to follow a nice mix of trails and roads. The bonus was beautiful scenery!!! Would definitely recommend!" (https://www.ironbull.org/essential-gravel-ride-details)

**Shane Hitz (Course Designer) [COMPETITIVE]:** "This gravel ride is perfect for someone new to gravel riding with three loop options, all of which are relatively flat. Although gravel is less common in eastern Marathon County (roughly half of the route is gravel) the more abundant lakes add a scenic value." (https://www.ironbull.org/in-the-news/essential-gravel)

**Andrea Larson (IRONBULL Executive Director) [UNKNOWN]:** "After fantastic feedback from riders during the inaugural Red Granite Grinder, I was ecstatic that Shane was willing to design this course for riders. I have no doubt first time gravel riders will enjoy the course." (https://www.ironbull.org/in-the-news/essential-gravel)

**Michael Gerbino [UNKNOWN]:** "Dirt, rocks, steep climbs, sun, and breathtaking views! [...] We began our ride in the charming village of Borgo Parrini, which has been transformed in recent years by local artists into a vibrant canvas of colorful murals, mosaics, and Sicilian folk art. After a brief ride inland, we tackled the steep gravel ascent of Monte Palmeto, navigating through a small forest of cluster pines, sheer rock formations, dwarf palms, and Mediterranean scrub. [...] During our descent, which was bumpy at times, we encountered herds of local Cinisara cows, were chased by a few dogs, got muddy, and even crossed a small river. It was the perfect recipe for a gravel adventure." (https://www.beyondthepeloton.cc/blog/essential-gravel)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

### Tires

**[ELITE] Tire Width Guidelines:**
- "25–28mm: This is 'groad' territory, meaning it's just wide enough to keep cruising when the Saturday morning ride bangs a left onto an unpaved connector road."
- "30–32mm: Once you cross from mostly pavement with some gravel sections to mostly gravel with some pavement sections, you're going to want to bump up to the 30s."
- "33–38mm: A tire in this range, especially at the wider range, will get you through pretty much anything."
- "40–44mm: Yes, this sounds like a monster-size tire, but with super-fast rolling rubber like the Schwalbe G-One Speeds, this size works for many different terrains."
- "45mm+: If you're looking to hit singletrack and go deep into adventure territory, 650b with massive tires is a horizon-opening choice."
(https://www.bicycling.com/skills-tips/a33266537/expert-gravel-guide-3/)

**Ken Avery (tire guru) [ELITE] on tread patterns:**
- "Mostly hard pack: If you're doing a ride that is 70 percent pavement and 30 percent gravel, look for a tire that has a slick center with texture on the shoulder"
- "Mostly dry gravel: you want a more textured centerline so you roll fast and still have good traction for climbing and braking"
- "Mostly muddy dirt roads: A good mud tire has a mixed tread, with the knobs tighter in the center, so it still rolls faster, but more spaced out toward the outside"
(https://www.bicycling.com/skills-tips/a33266537/expert-gravel-guide-3/)

**[ELITE] General Tire Advice:**
"Tubeless tires are often the go-to choice for gravel races due to their added puncture protection and improved grip at lower pressures. Running lower tire pressure on tubeless tires cuts down on rolling resistance and boosts puncture protection." Popular brands mentioned: Vittoria, Continental, Specialized, Schwalbe (https://blog.irace.ai/gravel-racing)

**[COMPETITIVE] SBT GRVL Specific:**
- "Minimum 35mm tire width. Common tire setups for the event are 38-40c tires. If you want an even smoother ride, try rocking 45c tires."
- "You'll want a fast-rolling tire that can grip softer corners. A textured center area will roll fast but provide enough grip for braking and for traction on hills."
- "Tire pressure: This depends on tire width, personal preference, and whether you are riding tires with tubes or a tubeless setup. Generally, lower pressures help with traction and smoothing out the bumps."

### Pedals & Shoes

**[ELITE]:** "On a gravel bike, riders use the same pedals traditionally used on mountain bikes (versus road bike pedals). These pedals and shoe combinations are preferred for environments ridden in gravel racing that include mud, water, and grit. The shoes are preferred for walking off the bike, which may be required at times." (https://blog.irace.ai/gravel-racing)

### Gearing

**[ELITE]:** "Both 1x drivetrains, which have a single chainring and a wide-range cassette, and 2x drivetrains, which provide a wider range of gear ratios, have their advantages. The 1x drivetrains streamline shifting and minimize weight and tend to be more popular with racing bikes. The 2x drivetrains tend to enhance control over cadence and effort." (https://blog.irace.ai/gravel-racing)

### Bags & Storage

**[UNKNOWN LEVEL]:** "To carry food plus other supplies, there are larger, sturdier, weatherproof bags that hang from the top tube (and are strapped tight by attachments to other tubes) to sit inside the main triangle of the frame. Look for bags with mesh side pockets, which make it super easy to stash your gels and bars; easy-to-access openings, so if you're wearing thick gloves you can open zippers and buckles easily, including cases with magnetic closures" (https://www.bicycling.com/skills-tips/a33266537/expert-gravel-guide-3/)

**[UNKNOWN LEVEL]:** "I've used one of these, a Speedsleev, on some of the rockiest, most jarring descents in the country, and it's never come loose, or rubbed or snagged on my shorts the way some saddlebags do." (https://www.bicycling.com/skills-tips/a33266537/expert-gravel-guide-3/)

### Tools & Repair Kits

**[ELITE]:** Essential items to carry:
- "Multitool with chain tool and any specific bits that fit your bike. Having a spoke wrench included is a nice touch, too."
- "Inflation devices: CO2 cartridges are fast but a hand pump works for multiple flats."
- "Tire repair tools, tire lever, and a tube: Torn sidewalls and punctures that are too big for sealant are possible, so if you run tubeless bring a tire plug kit, a tube, and a tire boot."
- "Small parts – In a small plastic bag, pack one set of brake pads, a derailleur hanger, a quick link, and 1-2 pedal cleats with screws. Put a few zip ties and a length of duct tape into your pack."
(https://trainright.com/gravel-racing-gear-guide/)

**[UNKNOWN LEVEL]:** "Gear cleaning brush: You won't always need this one, but when you need it, you really need it. If you're on routes such as Mid South, Unbound, or other rides known for notoriously sticky mud, your drivetrain can get so packed that you can't move." (https://www.bicycling.com/skills-tips/a33266537/expert-gravel-guide-3/)

### Mudguards

**[UNKNOWN LEVEL]:** "Full-coverage fenders don't allow much tire clearance, so they pack up with mud very easily, which will slow or completely stop your roll. Instead go with clip-on mudguards like the Portland Design Works Origami Rear Fender, which clamps onto your seat tube. Or try the type that attach to your saddle rails, such as the Ass Saver by Ornot or the Ass Saver by Ass Savers." (https://www.bicycling.com/skills-tips/a33266537/expert-gravel-guide-3/)

(https://www.ironbull.org/essential-gravel-ride-details, https://www.ironbull.org/in-the-news/essential-gravel)

**Monte Palmeto, Sicily [UNKNOWN]:**
- "We tackled the steep gravel ascent of Monte Palmeto, navigating through a small forest of cluster pines, sheer rock formations, dwarf palms, and Mediterranean scrub"
- "As we gained elevation, the vegetation began to dwindle, and the trail twisted through rocky patches, dirt, and a few mud puddles"
- "During our descent, which was bumpy at times, we encountered herds of local Cinisara cows, were chased by a few dogs, got muddy, and even crossed a small river"

## Race Strategy & Pacing

### Training Recommendations

**[ELITE] 12-Week Training Plan Phases:**
- **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4) Base Building:** "Zone 2 with 4x30s surges (75 min), strength training (45 min), long ride (2.5-3.5 hrs)"
- **Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8) Build:** "Increase long ride to 4-5 hours, Add tempo intervals: 2-3 x 15-20 min at sweet spot (88-93% FTP), Include one VO2max session weekly: 5-6 x 3-4 min at 105-115% FTP"
- **Phase 3 (Weeks 9-11) Peak:** "Long ride reaches 5-6 hours (70-80% of race distance), Include race-simulation rides with full nutrition/equipment"
- **Phase 4 (Week 12) Taper:** "Reduce volume by 40-50%, Keep 2-3 short, sharp efforts to maintain top-end"
(https://runbikecalc.com/blog/gravel-cycling-training-complete-guide)

**[ELITE] Physical Demands:**
"Unlike steady road racing where you can draft and maintain consistent power, gravel requires constant surges. Loose corners, short climbs, technical sections, and accelerations out of rough patches create a stochastic power profile. Your training must include variable intensity work." (https://runbikecalc.com/blog/gravel-cycling-training-complete-guide)

**[ELITE] Low-Cadence Training:**
"Loose surfaces often require lower cadences to maintain traction. You can't spin through gravel the way you might climb a paved road. Training should include low-cadence strength work (50-60 RPM) to build the muscular endurance for grinding when needed." (https://runbikecalc.com/blog/gravel-cycling-training-complete-guide)

### Nutrition Strategy

**[ELITE] During-Race Fueling:**
- "Target 60-90 grams of carbohydrates per hour. For events over 3 hours, the higher end (80-90g) becomes critical. This requires gut training—practice during training rides to increase tolerance."
- "Set a timer or use GPS reminders to eat every 20-30 minutes"
- "Mix fuel sources: gels, chews, bars, real food, sports drink"
- "Include sodium: 500-1000mg per hour depending on heat/sweat rate"
- "Don't wait until hungry—by then you're already behind"
(https://runbikecalc.com/blog/gravel-cycling-training-complete-guide)

**[ELITE] Pre-Race:**
- "Carb-load 2-3 days before (8-10g carbs/kg bodyweight daily)"
- "Pre-race meal 3-4 hours before start: 2-4g carbs/kg, low fat/fiber"
- "Final top-up 30-60 minutes before: gel or sports drink"
(https://runbikecalc.com/blog/gravel-cycling-training-complete-guide)

**[COMPETITIVE] Hydration:**
"In hot conditions, plan for 500-1000ml per hour. Know where water resupply points are and carry enough capacity to get there with a margin of safety." (https://trainright.com/gravel-racing-gear-guide/)

### Navigation

**[ELITE]:** "GPS navigational aids such as the best GPS watches or bike computers can guide you through the rugged terrain and keep you on course. Get your hands on route maps from race promoters, in the race packet or online, and familiarize yourself with the course in advance. During the race, look out for marked signs, stakes, and spray paint that guide the racers. On some courses it can be easy to get lost." (https://blog.irace.ai/gravel-racing)

**Essential Gravel Specific [COMPETITIVE]:**
"Since the route is unmarked, download the cue sheets and GPX files." (https://www.ironbull.org/essential-gravel-ride-details)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**[UNKNOWN]:** "Gravel racing is known for its inclusive nature and the camaraderie it fosters among participants, especially during gravel stage races. The atmosphere is what many people like about a gravel race. Whether you are an amateur or a professional, gravel races welcome everyone." (https://blog.irace.ai/gravel-racing)

**[UNKNOWN]:** "Similar to an Ironman triathlon, you get the opportunity to race alongside professionals, but at your own pace. For many racers, simply finishing is the reward." (https://blog.irace.ai/gravel-racing)

**Essential Gravel (Wisconsin) [COMPETITIVE]:**
- "This free bike ride is returning in 2025 for its 6th year! Its purpose is to introduce people to gravel riding and provide an option for gravel enthusiasts. You may ride at a leisurely pace or race and get some competitive juices flowing. You can even ride the course as many times as you want!"
- "Haven't done a gravel ride before? Historically, most of the Essential Gravel riders were participating in their first-ever gravel ride too! So this is a perfect event for you to try it out!"
- "Since we want to make this not just competitive, but fun, we want to encourage all ability levels. So we have lots of ways to win prizes and you don't need to be the fastest to win!"
- "Participants can do the route as many times as they wish and get a drawing entry for each time they participate!"
- "The event is completely free!"
(https://www.ironbull.org/essential-gravel-ride-details)

**[UNKNOWN]:** "The community emphasizes adventure, self-sufficiency, and shared suffering over podium finishes." (https://runbikecalc.com/blog/gravel-cycling-training-complete-guide)

**[ELITE]:** "Road racing requires understanding complex tactics, riding in tight packs, and often involves crashes. Gravel racing spreads riders out, eliminates most drafting benefits, and reduces crash risks. You're racing the course and yourself more than other competitors." (https://runbikecalc.com/blog/gravel-cycling-training-complete-guide)
