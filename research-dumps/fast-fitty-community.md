## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**singletrackchronicles [UNKNOWN]:** "I checked the weather before I went to bed on Friday and I was already waffling. While it wasn't a huge chance of rain....pushing 50% for thunderstorms was making me pause a bit... I drew a very misleading number plate. All this means is that I was the 6th person to sign up....and nothing more. lol. It was, however, funny to get glances in the starting pen. One guy looked at my number, then slowly looked up at me.....with just a blank stare." (https://singletrackchronicles.blogspot.com/2025/08/)

**singletrackchronicles [UNKNOWN]:** "Right off the pavement it was pure washboard. I couldn't avoid it. It was high speed, and it sucked. We had built the group to around 10 at this point. People scattered. I ripped into the bumps and got slung out of the group. This was where my problems started. Not a major impact, but just a rough segment." (https://singletrackchronicles.blogspot.com/2025/08/)

**singletrackchronicles [UNKNOWN]:** "Around mile 20 I was riding alone. I had a guy catch me. He moved ahead of me and waved me to follow. We worked together for the next few miles trying to catch people ahead of us. It was exactly what I needed and what I wanted to do. Work with people towards the finish line. Unfortunately he was stronger and I couldn't hang on a long climb." (https://singletrackchronicles.blogspot.com/2025/08/)

**singletrackchronicles [UNKNOWN]:** "I had two incidents with potholes in this stretch towards mile 30. The transitions into the shadows are where they happened. One was a descent wh[ere the description cuts off]" (https://singletrackchronicles.blogspot.com/2025/08/)

**Gimpdiggity [RECREATIONAL]:** "I tried it last year and took a DNF. I want to try the 53 again this year, but a friend wants to do the 35-ish route. Last year I rode by myself, and for a good portion of the 41 I finished, I was literally solo, so I'm tempted to just do the 35 to have someone with me...but I'm not sure." (https://www.reddit.com/r/MichiganCycling/comments/m42j3d/anyone_doing_fast_fitty_gravel_race_in_charlotte/)

**Gimpdiggity [RECREATIONAL]:** "I want to complete the 53 mile route on the Fast Fitty Gravel Race in Charlotte. It was my first race back in 2020 and I bonked at mile 35-ish. Finished the shorter course in 2021, but sat out the next two years with injury and lack of saddle time." (https://www.reddit.com/r/MichiganCycling/comments/18vrrkk/what_are_your_2024_cycling_goals/)

**singletrackchronicles [UNKNOWN]:** "At this point I am down nearly 87 pounds from my heaviest. For those that don't like math....I am sitting at 222. This is close to the weight that I was after I broke my foot in 1999. I feel better. I move better. I just had my yearly checkup and my doctor told me that my numbers were looking better. I am faster on the bike than I can ever remember." (https://singletrackchronicles.blogspot.com/2025/08/)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Gravel Surface Conditions:**
- Course is approximately 80-95% gravel depending on the route distance (official sources)
- "Right off the pavement it was pure washboard. I couldn't avoid it. It was high speed, and it sucked" at approximately miles 3-5 on the 54-mile route [UNKNOWN] (https://singletrackchronicles.blogspot.com/2025/08/)

**Paved Sections:**
- First mile on paved N. Wheaton Rd before turning onto Valley Highway (official sources)
- Mile 3: Short paved section with "short climb before a nice descent" [UNKNOWN] (https://singletrackchronicles.blogspot.com/2025/08/week-update-and-fast-fitty-course.html)
- Mile 10-12: Multiple paved sections including blacktop/chip seal [UNKNOWN] (https://singletrackchronicles.blogspot.com/2025/08/week-update-and-fast-fitty-course.html)
- Mile 25: "Finally time to turn North. While its paved, the road is uphill. Not steep, just another grind. Seems like a long stretch of road here." [UNKNOWN] (https://singletrackchronicles.blogspot.com/2025/08/week-update-and-fast-fitty-course.html)
- Final mile: Paved finish with "a little grind up, but you are rewarded by a fast roll to the finish line" [UNKNOWN] (https://singletrackchronicles.blogspot.com/2025/08/week-update-and-fast-fitty-course.html)

**Hills & Climbing:**
- "Long, grinding climbs that make you wonder if the course ever flattens or goes downhill" (https://www.jointhefightmi.org/fastfitty)
- Mile 5-9: "Rolling gravel... More rollers, but nothing ugly" [UNKNOWN] (https://singletrackchronicles.blogspot.com/2025/08/week-update-and-fast-fitty-course.html)
- Mile 15-20: "The rollers are getting bigger here. Instead of 2-3% the hills can touch 5 or 6%... Still heading West the rollers just continue. Because the road is straight, you can see them coming." [UNKNOWN] (https://singletrackchronicles.blogspot.com/2025/08/week-update-and-fast-fitty-course.html)
- Mile 35: "A climb will hit 7% grade, then flatten into 3-4% for a while. It flattens out after bit and you hang a left before another climb that reaches 6%." [UNKNOWN] (https://singletrackchronicles.blogspot.com/2025/08/week-update-and-fast-fitty-course.html)
- Mile 52: "Around mile 52 is a kicker. More rollers." [UNKNOWN] (https://singletrackchronicles.blogspot.com/2025/08/week-update-and-fast-fitty-course.html)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Start & Early Race [UNKNOWN]:**
"You roll under the banner and onto a mile of blacktop. Good place to sort out the groups before hanging a left onto the gravel where the fun begins... They announced a 'controlled start'....but it felt like anything but. I jumped onto a wheel and we were cruising. The start being pavement helps to spread things out." (https://singletrackchronicles.blogspot.com/2025/08/)

**Wind Management [UNKNOWN]:**
"Around 3 miles in... Around mile 5... It will probably be into the wind for a few miles, so tuck into a group and suck some wheels. Closer to 9 miles in the course turns South and is more protected from a Westerly wind." (https://singletrackchronicles.blogspot.com/2025/08/week-update-and-fast-fitty-course.html)

"Mile 15: Likely heading straight into the wind, this stretch will be tough. Sometimes protected from the wind, other times wide open, a group will be helpful here too. This part to the West is fairly flat, but not a lot of trees." (https://singletrackchronicles.blogspot.com/2025/08/week-update-and-fast-fitty-course.html)

**Group Dynamics [UNKNOWN]:**
"I saw the main group make the left onto the gravel and I was settling in. I found a people riding my pace and we made the left into the gravel, and the wind... I don't think he liked it much, because he tried to accelerate and drop me. But 2 others latched on with me. We had a small group of 4... We made the next left back onto the pavement and the destruction started. With all different levels of climbers the group spread out pretty quick." (https://singletrackchronicles.blogspot.com/2025/08/)

**Course Character [UNKNOWN]:**
"This course is always fast, because the hills are not super tough. The distance starts adding up and the elevation keeps creeping." (https://singletrackchronicles.blogspot.com/2025/08/week-update-and-fast-fitty-course.html)

**Finish Strategy [UNKNOWN]:**
"Mile 50: Speeds are likely picking up now, as people get set up for the finish. The fast guys are long gone and likely done already....but we still have a few miles to go... Left turn at the cemetery and you are almost done. That left marks the last stretch before the pavement roll into the finish." (https://singletrackchronicles.blogspot.com/2025/08/week-update-and-fast-fitty-course.html)

**Traffic Awareness:**
"Mile 45: Be aware of traffic from the shorter races now" as routes converge near the finish [UNKNOWN] (https://singletrackchronicles.blogspot.com/2025/08/week-update-and-fast-fitty-course.html)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Bonking & Distance [RECREATIONAL]:**
"I want to try the 53 again this year... It was my first race back in 2020 and I bonked at mile 35-ish" (https://www.reddit.com/r/MichiganCycling/comments/18vrrkk/what_are_your_2024_cycling_goals/)

**Solo Riding Challenges [RECREATIONAL]:**
"Last year I rode by myself, and for a good portion of the 41 I finished, I was literally solo, so I'm tempted to just do the 35 to have someone with me" - suggesting isolation can be a mental/physical challenge (https://www.reddit.com/r/MichiganCycling/comments/m42j3d/anyone_doing_fast_fitty_gravel_race_in_charlotte/)

**Course Difficulty Accumulation [UNKNOWN]:**
"Keep rolling with the punches. This course is always fast, because the hills are not super tough. The distance starts adding up and the elevation keeps creeping." - suggesting cumulative fatigue is a key factor (https://singletrackchronicles.blogspot.com/2025/08/week-update-and-fast-fitty-course.html)

**Heat Exposure [UNKNOWN]:**
"Mile 15: Its early in the race, but if the heat is ramping up you will feel this section" - exposed West-heading section with limited tree cover (https://singletrackchronicles.blogspot.com/2025/08/week-update-and-fast-fitty-course.html)

**Course Hazards [UNKNOWN]:**
- Washboard sections that can break up groups and cause fatigue around miles 3-5
- Potholes in shadow transitions on descents around mile 30

**General Heat Considerations [UNKNOWN]:**
"Mile 15... Its early in the race, but if the heat is ramping up you will feel this section" - West-heading section with limited tree protection can be exposed to heat (https://singletrackchronicles.blogspot.com/2025/08/week-update-and-fast-fitty-course.html)
