# FILTHY 50 — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Nicholas Garbis [RECREATIONAL]:** "One of the greatest mysteries in the Minnesota gravel cycling scene is how a race called the 'Filthy 50' has gone so long without really getting filthy. I mean, it's a mid-October event in Minnesota where there have been blizzards on Halloween. Sure, the race has been dusty, but all of my memories of the Filthy 50 are filled with images of sun and mild (or hot!) temps. I don't think I've worn a jacket. Ever." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-the-filthy-50-finally-filthy-so-very-filthy-stewartville-minnesota-by-nicholas-garbis/)

**Nicholas Garbis [RECREATIONAL]:** "The combination of the relatively shorter distance and the weather history (along with the fact that it is late in the season so riders are in good form) has made the Filthy 50 into the 'gateway drug' for gravel cycling. I don't count the names beyond my friends, but I know that the Filthy has been the first gravel event for probably a dozen of them." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-the-filthy-50-finally-filthy-so-very-filthy-stewartville-minnesota-by-nicholas-garbis/)

**Nicholas Garbis [RECREATIONAL]:** "Once we hit the gravel, the muck started to spray everything. I remember seeing a dude in a green wool sweater as the spray started to build upon his back. The spray was streaming from people's rear wheels, forward against their vertical seat tubes, dripping downward like a car wash. I immediately lost any visibility of my computer screen despite wiping with my glove." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-the-filthy-50-finally-filthy-so-very-filthy-stewartville-minnesota-by-nicholas-garbis/)

**Nicholas Garbis [RECREATIONAL]:** "This is now what I am calling the 'meteor strategy' -- hurtling myself into inhospitable atmosphere of the faster riders and hoping I don't completely disintegrate before landing at the finish line, even if all that remains at the end is a small, smoldering and scarred stone remnant of what I was at the start." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-the-filthy-50-finally-filthy-so-very-filthy-stewartville-minnesota-by-nicholas-garbis/)

**Nicholas Garbis [RECREATIONAL]:** "My shifting was completely wrecked, pretty much the middle range of the cassette was jumping around and got worse as the day went. I was just switching the front from big ring to small ring and back as I 'crested' the mild elevations. Just wanted to keep spinning." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-the-filthy-50-finally-filthy-so-very-filthy-stewartville-minnesota-by-nicholas-garbis/)

**Nicholas Garbis [RECREATIONAL]:** "My hands were failing me -- I needed to look at them while shifting -- and my face was cast in limestone crust and immovable. I had turned into a gravel zombie." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-the-filthy-50-finally-filthy-so-very-filthy-stewartville-minnesota-by-nicholas-garbis/)

**Julie Dunkle [UNKNOWN]:** "WTF. That was literally my first thought. I wanted to buy a mountain bike so I could become a better gravel cyclist — not to race one. Maybe someday, sure, but mostly I just wanted to learn the skills, build confidence on dirt, and stop panicking every time the gravel got chunky." (https://juliedunkle.substack.com/p/wtf-my-first-mountain-bike-race-the)

**Julie Dunkle [UNKNOWN]:** "From the gun, we were in over our heads. Within half a mile — half a mile! — we were dropped. Gone. Watching the entire field roll away while I was still trying to clip in." (https://juliedunkle.substack.com/p/wtf-my-first-mountain-bike-race-the)

**Julie Dunkle [UNKNOWN]:** "The rest of the day was a lesson in humility. I would think, Okay, now I'm pushing. This has to be fast. And then I'd look down and realize… nope. The bike wasn't going any faster... My fear of crashing outweighed my sense of adventure." (https://juliedunkle.substack.com/p/wtf-my-first-mountain-bike-race-the)

**Julie Dunkle [UNKNOWN]:** "When the results came out, we discovered we were the last two finishers in our age group. Probably close to the back of the entire race. And honestly? I was okay with it — sort of, ok, that's a lie, not OK." (https://juliedunkle.substack.com/p/wtf-my-first-mountain-bike-race-the)

**ALMSTHRE blogger [COMPETITIVE]:** "It's definitely not a casual ride—people often underestimate it based on the numbers, but by the end, you know you've been tested... Most of the day, it feels like a hard, steady effort—you're working, you're pushing, and yes, your heart rate stays high. By the end, you're exhausted, but there's a real sense of accomplishment." (https://almsthre.com/blogs/news/2025-quick-n-dirty-filthy-50)

**ALMSTHRE blogger [COMPETITIVE]:** "The finish was wild this year, with the top 10 riders crossing within seconds of each other." (https://almsthre.com/blogs/news/2025-quick-n-dirty-filthy-50)

**NewMe1977 [RECREATIONAL]:** "I rode in my first gravel race this weekend. I tackled The Filthy 50 in Lanesboro, MN. 50 miles of gravel roads, 3300 feet of elevation gain, 7:12 grueling hours, 1 incredible journey. Everyone was so nice and welcoming. It was hard but I am so glad I did it." (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/xzvykt/filthy_50/)

**NewMe1977 [RECREATIONAL]:** "I rode my Salsa Mukluk in my first gravel race this weekend. 50 miles of gravel roads, 3300 feet of elevation gain, 7:12 grueling hours, 1 incredible journey" (https://www.reddit.com/r/fatbike/comments/y0cf05/filthy_50/)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Eye Protection [RECREATIONAL - Nicholas Garbis]:** "I also forgot to wear eye protection. Not sure glasses would have really helped much, but I don't think I have ever had so much interest in other people's sunglasses in one day as I did on Sunday." In extreme wet/muddy conditions, eye protection becomes critical even if visibility is compromised. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-the-filthy-50-finally-filthy-so-very-filthy-stewartville-minnesota-by-nicholas-garbis/)

**Water Bottles [RECREATIONAL - Nicholas Garbis]:** "I have just barely been able to drink any water -- the bottle top was crusted over with sand and required a swish-spit-drink routine." In muddy conditions, bottle tops get caked with limestone spray. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-the-filthy-50-finally-filthy-so-very-filthy-stewartville-minnesota-by-nicholas-garbis/)

**Saddle Protection [RECREATIONAL - Nicholas Garbis]:** "My leather saddle had been lapping up water the whole morning (where are all the shower caps that I've been collecting from hotels!?!)." Leather saddles need protection in wet conditions; shower caps are recommended. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-the-filthy-50-finally-filthy-so-very-filthy-stewartville-minnesota-by-nicholas-garbis/)

**Fat Bike Usage [RECREATIONAL - NewMe1977]:** Successfully completed the 50-mile Lanesboro course on a Salsa Mukluk fat bike in 7:12. (https://www.reddit.com/r/fatbike/comments/y0cf05/filthy_50/)

**Fixed Gear [UNKNOWN]:** At least one rider completed the Lanesboro course on a fixie, suggesting it's possible but challenging given the elevation. (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/q5y7p4/filthy_50_in_lanesboro_mn_on_the_fixie/)

**Computer/GPS [RECREATIONAL - Nicholas Garbis]:** "I immediately lost any visibility of my computer screen despite wiping with my glove." In wet, muddy conditions, bike computer screens become unreadable from limestone spray. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-the-filthy-50-finally-filthy-so-very-filthy-stewartville-minnesota-by-nicholas-garbis/)

## Weather Experienced

**2018 Event (Stewartville) - Extreme Conditions:** "The weather forecast in the last week descended into cycling hell – eventually, it was temperatures just above freezing with rain/snow mix... The snow was not thick but it was wet." This was the year the race finally lived up to its "Filthy" name after years of mild weather. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-the-filthy-50-finally-filthy-so-very-filthy-stewartville-minnesota-by-nicholas-garbis/)

**2018 Event Conditions:** 533 riders started despite snow/freezing rain conditions. The PA system wouldn't work in the weather. Multiple experienced riders turned back after breakfast before the start. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-the-filthy-50-finally-filthy-so-very-filthy-stewartville-minnesota-by-nicholas-garbis/)

**Historical Pattern (pre-2018):** "All of my memories of the Filthy 50 are filled with images of sun and mild (or hot!) temps. I don't think I've worn a jacket. Ever." The race had a reputation for unusually good October weather in Minnesota before 2018. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-the-filthy-50-finally-filthy-so-very-filthy-stewartville-minnesota-by-nicholas-garbis/)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Limestone Spray:** "Once we hit the gravel, the muck started to spray everything... The spray was streaming from people's rear wheels, forward against their vertical seat tubes, dripping downward like a car wash." Riders closer to the front/drafting got significantly dirtier than those riding alone. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-the-filthy-50-finally-filthy-so-very-filthy-stewartville-minnesota-by-nicholas-garbis/)

**Mid-Course Landmarks (Stewartville Course):** "Around halfway, there's a church and then soon after, at a bridge before a hill, there's a Banjo Brothers support tent where whiskey and coke and cookies are offered... there's always a hill after a bridge." Key landmark at approximately mile 32. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-the-filthy-50-finally-filthy-so-very-filthy-stewartville-minnesota-by-nicholas-garbis/)

**Course Monitoring:** Trenton's dad Joel stands at crossroads calling out rider positions/numbers as they pass. At mile 42, riders get an "Eight miles to go" call. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-the-filthy-50-finally-filthy-so-very-filthy-stewartville-minnesota-by-nicholas-garbis/)

**Final Sections:** "The gravel sections mostly ended and turned into pavement for the last couple miles or so. I could see the water tower in Stewartville." The race finishes with pavement back into town. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-the-filthy-50-finally-filthy-so-very-filthy-stewartville-minnesota-by-nicholas-garbis/)

**Lanesboro Course:** "50 miles of gravel roads, 3300 feet of elevation gain" with "Raptor Ridge, a singletrack descent" mentioned as a technical feature. (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/xzvykt/filthy_50/ and https://juliedunkle.substack.com/p/wtf-my-first-mountain-bike-race-the)

**Michigan Course (Dirty 30 Event):** "The course will also take you through a tunnel underneath Interstate 96. There are some very talented artists that decorated the tunnel... Ivan the Terrible [hill] will be waiting." The course includes remote sections where "dogs weren't sure how to react to cyclists" and passes close to farms. The race is "fairly flat except for about three decent hills, one at 13 miles and two near the very end; Ivan's the name of the biggest climb." (https://dirtythirtygravelgrinder.com/filthy50/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/MichiganCycling/comments/1c532g6/gravel_race_recap_video_2m10s_dirty_30s_filthy_50/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**"Meteor Strategy" [RECREATIONAL - Nicholas Garbis]:** "Hurtling myself into inhospitable atmosphere of the faster riders and hoping I don't completely disintegrate before landing at the finish line... I press ahead near the top 20-ish riders and then fade back into trailing groups (of other meteors) as the miles go, trying to hang on to each passing group before realizing I am nearing the 'melting rate' and letting off a bit to ride solo until the next posse appears." Starting fast and gradually fading through groups. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-the-filthy-50-finally-filthy-so-very-filthy-stewartville-minnesota-by-nicholas-garbis/)

**Position Counting [RECREATIONAL - Nicholas Garbis]:** "Hearing I was sitting within the first 50 meant I had around 18 miles to go and just had to be sure I was not passed by 10 riders. I could not see how many miles were left, but I just needed to count riders not miles." When computer screens are unreadable, shift to counting positions rather than miles. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-the-filthy-50-finally-filthy-so-very-filthy-stewartville-minnesota-by-nicholas-garbis/)

**Nutrition Challenges [RECREATIONAL - Nicholas Garbis]:** "My food bars were like rocks so I only had one and a half in the ride" over approximately 3-4 hours. In extreme cold/wet, bars become too hard to eat. Note: This resulted in hallucinations ("when I looked behind me and saw I was being pursued by a group of about five riders, it turned out to be only one person"). (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-the-filthy-50-finally-filthy-so-very-filthy-stewartville-minnesota-by-nicholas-garbis/)

**Early Dropout Decision [RECREATIONAL - Multiple Riders]:** "Given my experience over the rest of the day, I think they made very sound and reasonable decisions. It was the intelligent thing to do." Multiple experienced riders turned back after breakfast in the 2018 extreme conditions. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-the-filthy-50-finally-filthy-so-very-filthy-stewartville-minnesota-by-nicholas-garbis/)

**Pre-Race Fueling [RECREATIONAL]:** Riders traditionally meet at Tarsilla's in Stewartville for "good greasy spoon country breakfast cuisine" before the race. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-the-filthy-50-finally-filthy-so-very-filthy-stewartville-minnesota-by-nicholas-garbis/)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Hand Function in Cold/Wet [RECREATIONAL - Nicholas Garbis]:** "Couple of years ago under less harsh conditions I had to abandon/DNF on the Almanzo 100 due to wet/cold hands that lost ability to brake/shift/steer." This rider had previous DNF experience from hand failure in cold/wet conditions. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-the-filthy-50-finally-filthy-so-very-filthy-stewartville-minnesota-by-nicholas-garbis/)

**Mechanical Issues from Mud [RECREATIONAL - Nicholas Garbis]:** "My shifting was completely wrecked, pretty much the middle range of the cassette was jumping around and got worse as the day went." Limestone mud causes progressive drivetrain failure throughout the race. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-the-filthy-50-finally-filthy-so-very-filthy-stewartville-minnesota-by-nicholas-garbis/)

**Vision Impairment:** "My eyes were crusted and blurred with limestone, and I wondered if there's an amount of that acidic muck that could cause me to really lose my vision." Limestone spray creates genuine safety concerns. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-the-filthy-50-finally-filthy-so-very-filthy-stewartville-minnesota-by-nicholas-garbis/)

**Pre-Race Dropout Rate:** In 2018 extreme conditions, "even after a 90-minute drive down from 'the cities' of Minneapolis and St. Paul, a handful turned back after breakfast and returned to warm and dry cars with wet bikes in tow" before the race even started. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-the-filthy-50-finally-filthy-so-very-filthy-stewartville-minnesota-by-nicholas-garbis/)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Gateway Drug Reputation:** "The combination of the relatively shorter distance and the weather history (along with the fact that it is late in the season so riders are in good form) has made the Filthy 50 into the 'gateway drug' for gravel cycling." Many riders' first gravel event. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-the-filthy-50-finally-filthy-so-very-filthy-stewartville-minnesota-by-nicholas-garbis/)

**Welcoming Atmosphere [RECREATIONAL - NewMe1977]:** "Everyone was so nice and welcoming. It was hard but I am so glad I did it." First-time racer experience. (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/xzvykt/filthy_50/)

**Organizer Personality:** "Trenton stood in the back of a pickup – normal gravel race director sort of thing – and shouted out at the 533 riders that had suited up for the day. The PA system would not work in the weather." Race director Trenton described with "suspiciously chipper" demeanor even in terrible conditions. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-the-filthy-50-finally-filthy-so-very-filthy-stewartville-minnesota-by-nicholas-garbis/)

**Course Support:** Banjo Brothers provides mid-course support tent with "whiskey and coke and cookies" along with "Banjo Brothers Hollering crew" for encouragement. Trenton's dad Joel provides position updates at crossroads. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-the-filthy-50-finally-filthy-so-very-filthy-stewartville-minnesota-by-nicholas-garbis/)

**Special Awards:** Race introduced "Fast 50" and "Last 50" awards with "Fifty-cent coins drilled through and laced as a necklace with a leather strap and lantern rouge patches" for first and last 50 finishers. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-the-filthy-50-finally-filthy-so-very-filthy-stewartville-minnesota-by-nicholas-garbis/)

**Event Variety [COMPETITIVE]:** "The day starts at Expo Village with hundreds of riders getting ready for the 50-mile and 30-mile races, plus kids' races and a Halloween costume contest. It's part racing, part community hangout, part chaos, and that mix is exactly what makes it so fun... There's also a lot of personality out there costumes, good vibes, cheering, and the kind of friendly heckling that makes it memorable." (https://almsthre.com/blogs/news/2025-quick-n-dirty-filthy-50)

**Free/Unsupported Format:** The original Stewartville event was described as "a free unsupported gravel bike race." (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elT_Rh-zsrc)

**Multiple Locations:** The "Filthy 50" name is used for at least three different events: the Minnesota gravel race (Stewartville/Lanesboro), the California mountain bike race (Expo Village, 52 miles, 3,800 ft), and the Michigan Dirty 30 gravel event (Saranac). Each has its own character and terrain. (Multiple sources)

**Unicycle Participation [UNKNOWN]:** "A rather unique sight was the unicyclists participating in the gravel races. Almost caused a crash passing one because someone just turned, stared, and slowed suddenly." (https://www.reddit.com/r/MichiganCycling/comments/1c532g6/gravel_race_recap_video_2m10s_dirty_30s_filthy_50/)
