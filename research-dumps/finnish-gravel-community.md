# FNLD GRVL — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Graham Cottingham [ELITE]:** "It was clear from the start this was definitely a race, as very quickly the riding was flat out as racers jostled for positions on the first climb. I managed to get away with a fast group, strong pulls kept the pace high and we averaged almost 35kph over the undulating twisting Nordic ski paths... I was holding on for dear life, barrelling along in my biggest gear while trying to recover as best I could. I knew staying in this group would be my best shot at a decent time, although with my average heart rate at over 170bpm for the first 30 minutes I was starting to have doubts that I could hold on for much longer." (https://www.bikeperfect.com/features/fnld-grvl-ride-report)

**Graham Cottingham [ELITE]:** "The champagne gravel roads seemed to endlessly roll through the lush green Finnish farmland and woodland, very different from the rugged and harsh, heather-lined Scottish gravel tracks I am accustomed to... The picturesque smooth gravel tracks may have been technically easy to ride but the almost constant false flat effect of the very gently rolling course had been deceptively demanding." Finished in 6hrs 3mins. (https://www.bikeperfect.com/features/fnld-grvl-ride-report)

**Graham Cottingham [ELITE]:** "Around the 25km mark, [there was] a sharp right-hander into a steep incline, an aggressive front shift dropped my chain and it became well and truly jammed between the small ring and the frame. There was little more I could do than watch groups ride past as I tried to wrestle it free. After five minutes of frustrating fiddling and the chain was back on." (https://www.bikeperfect.com/features/fnld-grvl-ride-report)

**Suvi Loponen [ELITE]:** "The 40km 'Forest Route' of FNLD GRVL was to be the longest distance my sister had ever cycled in one go... The FNLD GRVL routes knitted together a lot of the cross-country skiing tracks of the area, making the riding quite roller-coaster-like with repeated fast descends followed by punchy climbs." (https://off-road.cc/content/feature/fnld-grvl-why-the-shortest-distance-is-often-the-sweetest-12795)

**Suvi Loponen [ELITE]:** "Most of the time, we were sheltered from the sun by the pine and birch trees which filtered the sun through the leaves ruffling in the slight wind that was present that day. The crushing of smooth gravel under the tyres wasn't too obtrusive in volume or technical to navigate to prevent chatting about everything." (https://off-road.cc/content/feature/fnld-grvl-why-the-shortest-distance-is-often-the-sweetest-12795)

**Miranda [COMPETITIVE]:** "I've tried to retrace the steps, or tire treads, that led me there, and got lost along the way... 77% of all the roads in Finland are gravel - according to a map Graeme found on Reddit. Paved roads would require such frequent, costly, repair, that roads outside cities (bar the freeways) are all smooth crushed gravel." (https://www.sram.com/es/life/stories/here-there-everywhere-fnld-grvl)

**Miranda [COMPETITIVE]:** "I rode my bike 165km from Helsinki to the race site in Lahti, on perfect smooth, gravel roads and paths... While never climbing for too long, the rolling hills can still add enough elevation to keep the rides interesting. Farms with small bright red barns and dopey looking ponies stood out in picturesque contrast to the fields of vibrant green while lakes or rivers dotted, but never interrupted, the route." (https://www.sram.com/es/life/stories/here-there-everywhere-fnld-grvl)

**Miranda [COMPETITIVE]:** "I entered free of expectation. I enjoyed the challenge of having to race 177km, a distance that is usually just a big endurance-training day for me. Racing is completely different! I tried my best to hang on to a fast group for as long as I could, then settled into a pack that matched my pace and we enjoyed the feeds and new friendships as we hammered along to the finish." (https://www.sram.com/es/life/stories/here-there-everywhere-fnld-grvl)

**Carolin Schiff [ELITE]:** "Arriving at FNLD GRVL after winning Unbound — people were suddenly treating me very differently. It's nice, for sure, but I also think it's a little unfair that people treat you differently just because you won a race. But in the races also, other riders now have me on their plan to watch. They know me now." (https://www.maurten.com/es/magazine/fnld-grvl-carolin-schiff)

**Carolin Schiff [ELITE]:** "If you always travel and race, you can't train anymore. Every ride is just a recovery ride from travel, so your performance decreases. For me, the best plan is now to take a bit of time to rest, recover and reset the body." (https://www.maurten.com/es/magazine/fnld-grvl-carolin-schiff)

**Carolin Schiff [ELITE]:** "From the beginning FNLD GRVL was like a road race. Riders had to be fresh and fast. But bad luck can always strike — even when you are in rich form — and Caro was hampered by 3 punctures, causing her to lose contact with the front group." (https://www.maurten.com/es/magazine/fnld-grvl-carolin-schiff)

**Elle (keepitsimpelle) [ELITE]:** "Well, that was a blast. What a beautiful, challenging route! The climbing felt relentless, the downhills needed bravery and the flat… someone forgot to include any flat parts." (https://www.keepitsimpelle.com/fnld-grvl-review/)

**Elle (keepitsimpelle) [ELITE]:** "With the route on my GPS I could see the climbs / elevation that was coming allowing me to pace myself. I made a huge effort to tackle as many of the hills as I could but it was difficult sometimes to take your ideal line when other riders were choosing to walk, even downhill... With mass events like this, group riding skills go a long way — warning others of hazards, making riders aware you're overtaking and on which side etc." (https://www.keepitsimpelle.com/fnld-grvl-review/)

**Elle (keepitsimpelle) [ELITE]:** "Just when we thought we had tackled all the climbing, came the finish line which if I remember correctly is one of the ski slopes in winter. From the bottom, it looked vertical and I knew that trying to walk up was gonna be harder than trying to ride... The support at the finish line got me up that climb to be honest. I needed and appreciated it." (https://www.keepitsimpelle.com/fnld-grvl-review/)

**Javi Angulo [ELITE]:** "We ended up accumulating 1.900 meters of elevation over the 178 kilometers of the route. During the day we discussed what are the possible racing scenarios ahead of the real event, and the ones with racing experience mentioned the several segments in which the race could be split. The gravel paths are wide, but at the top of our heads, we remember that there is a two-track grass field that will stretch any group that may remain with around 80 km to go." (https://rawcyclingmag.com/fnld-grvl-a-premier-gravel-event-in-the-making/)

**Javi Angulo [ELITE]:** "Back in Lahti's sports center, there was a common comment; it was one of the best gravel courses we had ever ridden. The varied surfaces and landscapes along the route amazed each one of us." (https://rawcyclingmag.com/fnld-grvl-a-premier-gravel-event-in-the-making/)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Elle (keepitsimpelle) [ELITE]:** Packed for unpredictable weather including:
- GPS device
- Warm layers including base layer, jersey, wind/rain jacket
- Casquette/cycling cap/ear warmers
- Photo-chromatic or changeable lens sunglasses
- Bar bag for snacks and tools
"FNLD GRVL organisers made it really clear that the weather in Lahti could be unpredictable... They literally said to pack 3 pairs of gloves… one for every season and I did that. As it turns out though, the rain subsided after Thursday and we got to enjoy plenty of sunshine." (https://www.keepitsimpelle.com/fnld-grvl-review/)

**Carolin Schiff [ELITE]:** Used Maurten Solid for recovery after the race. (https://www.maurten.com/es/magazine/fnld-grvl-carolin-schiff)

## Weather Experienced

**2023 Race Weather:** 
- Pre-race (Thursday): Rainy conditions
- Race day (Saturday): Sunshine with slight wind
- Temperature: Cooler than UK temperatures at the time, but warm enough for sunburn
- Daylight: "By June, Southern Finland gets 19hr of daylight on average each day" (https://www.keepitsimpelle.com/fnld-grvl-review/)

**Javi Angulo [ELITE] - August 2022 test ride:** "We got a tan in Finland, who would have thought?" Described as a "warm day" for testing the course. (https://rawcyclingmag.com/fnld-grvl-a-premier-gravel-event-in-the-making/)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Course Composition [ELITE observation]:** "The first 55 kilometers were entirely off-road... Most of the elevation gain in the FNLD GRVL course comes from the rolling gravel paths and not a climb in particular. In addition to a hilly start, only a steep ramp 13 km from the finish stands out from the rest of the route." (https://rawcyclingmag.com/fnld-grvl-a-premier-gravel-event-in-the-making/)

**Graham Cottingham [ELITE]:** "The course took a sharp right-hander into a steep incline around the 25km mark... The last 15km returned to the rolling ski trails that we had ridden flat out in the other direction at the start of the day. This time I was on my own but the punchy climbs and technical corners lifted my spirits and I had a great time ducking and weaving through the forest, although they could very easily punish wearier legs and trip up tired minds." (https://www.bikeperfect.com/features/fnld-grvl-ride-report)

**Surface Quality:** Multiple riders described the gravel as "champagne gravel," "smooth crushed gravel," and "pristine." Graham Cottingham [ELITE]: "Quintessential smooth Finnish gravel roads that make up much of the local infrastructure... very different from the rugged and harsh, heather-lined Scottish gravel tracks I am accustomed to." (https://www.bikeperfect.com/features/fnld-grvl-ride-report)

**Landscape [COMPETITIVE observation]:** "Quaint wooden houses painted either red or yellow were dotted along the course, their occupants at the side of the road waving and cheering riders on as they passed... The sheer vastness of the landscape skewed distance and time. Looking at my Garmin did little to help either as the numbers seemed to tick by slowly no matter how hard I pedaled." (https://www.bikeperfect.com/features/fnld-grvl-ride-report)

**Specific Section - Two-track grass field [ELITE observation]:** "Around 80km to go there is a two-track grass field that will stretch any group." (https://rawcyclingmag.com/fnld-grvl-a-premier-gravel-event-in-the-making/)

**Finish Climb [ELITE observation]:** "The finish line... is one of the ski slopes in winter. From the bottom, it looked vertical." Elle needed crowd support to complete it on the bike rather than walking. (https://www.keepitsimpelle.com/fnld-grvl-review/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**[ELITE Strategy] - Graham Cottingham:** "I managed to get away with a fast group, strong pulls kept the pace high and we averaged almost 35kph over the undulating twisting Nordic ski paths... my average heart rate at over 170bpm for the first 30 minutes." Finished 177km in 6hrs 3mins. (https://www.bikeperfect.com/features/fnld-grvl-ride-report)

**[ELITE] - Group Dynamics:** "Finding a fast group that worked well together was the key to success... I jumped over to another pair, the woman of the two was on a mission out of the feed station and with another larger group on the horizon, I was optimistic that we could bridge to a larger group. We both burned a few matches but much to my dismay it didn't work out again as sugar rushes faded and their pulls became shorter." (https://www.bikeperfect.com/features/fnld-grvl-ride-report)

**[ELITE] - Solo Pacing Warning:** "I rode by myself for a long time with hardly another rider in sight... Progress was fast but the sheer vastness of the landscape skewed distance and time... I was starting to become properly unraveled on the flat roads." (https://www.bikeperfect.com/features/fnld-grvl-ride-report)

**[ELITE] - Feed Station Strategy:** Feed stations at 100km mark (mandatory stop for bottles) and impromptu stations. Graham Cottingham: "An impromptu feed station stop for an irresistible can of Pepsi and a water refill reinvigorated me for a short while." (https://www.bikeperfect.com/features/fnld-grvl-ride-report)

**[ELITE] - Race Dynamics:** Javi Angulo noted "several segments in which the race could be split" and that "the gravel paths are wide" allowing for tactical racing. (https://rawcyclingmag.com/fnld-grvl-a-premier-gravel-event-in-the-making/)

**[ELITE] - Pro Performance:** Toms Skujins finished 177km in 4hrs 46mins; Tiffany Cromwell finished in 5hrs 14mins. Graham Cottingham noted: "it was hard to comprehend the Pro fields finishing times." (https://www.bikeperfect.com/features/fnld-grvl-ride-report)

**[COMPETITIVE] - Pacing for Non-Elites:** Miranda: "I tried my best to hang on to a fast group for as long as I could, then settled into a pack that matched my pace." She noted this was different from her usual mountain biking where she has higher expectations for results. (https://www.sram.com/es/life/stories/here-there-everywhere-fnld-grvl)

**[ELITE] - Travel/Recovery Impact:** Carolin Schiff: "If you always travel and race, you can't train anymore. Every ride is just a recovery ride from travel, so your performance decreases." She had won Unbound just before FNLD GRVL. (https://www.maurten.com/es/magazine/fnld-grvl-carolin-schiff)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Mechanical Issues [ELITE experience]:** Graham Cottingham: "Around the 25km mark... an aggressive front shift dropped my chain and it became well and truly jammed between the small ring and the frame. There was little more I could do than watch groups ride past as I tried to wrestle it free. After five minutes of frustrating fiddling and the chain was back on." He lost his initial fast group and spent 20km solo trying to catch back. (https://www.bikeperfect.com/features/fnld-grvl-ride-report)

**Punctures [ELITE experience]:** Carolin Schiff "was hampered by 3 punctures, causing her to lose contact with the front group." (https://www.maurten.com/es/magazine/fnld-grvl-carolin-schiff)

**Mental/Physical Unraveling [ELITE experience]:** Graham Cottingham: "I was starting to become properly unraveled on the flat roads" during a long solo section. "The sheer vastness of the landscape skewed distance and time. Looking at my Garmin did little to help either as the numbers seemed to tick by slowly no matter how hard I pedaled." (https://www.bikeperfect.com/features/fnld-grvl-ride-report)

**Group Cohesion Issues [ELITE experience]:** "I jumped over to another pair... but no one was willing to put work in and it split three ways." Graham rode solo for extended periods after groups fractured. (https://www.bikeperfect.com/features/fnld-grvl-ride-report)

**Rider Skill Mismatches [ELITE observation]:** Elle: "It was difficult sometimes to take your ideal line when other riders were choosing to walk, even downhill. I've noticed that when less experienced / confident riders are together, they'll generally follow the consensus of those ahead of them." (https://www.keepitsimpelle.com/fnld-grvl-review/)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**"Spirit of Gravel" Philosophy:** The event's tagline is 'the spirit of gravel' with the aim "to create a gravel event in Europe that wasn't just a race, but also a fun experience and attract riders from all over to visit Finland." (https://www.bikeperfect.com/features/fnld-grvl-ride-report)

**Inclusivity [ELITE observation]:** Suvi Loponen: "One of the distinguishing features of gravel cycling is the 'spirit of gravel'... Often, we see it being a sort of chill, inclusive atmosphere that surrounds gravel cycling and gravel events, where completion is as – or more – celebrated as competition." The 40km route "had no podiums or equal prize money for the winners. It was rather about completing the route and having a good time." (https://off-road.cc/content/feature/fnld-grvl-why-the-shortest-distance-is-often-the-sweetest-12795)

**Multi-Day Festival Atmosphere:** "The proceedings spanned four days with plenty of shakedown rides, yoga, and other activities." Activities included: VIP shakeout rides, Zip and Sip Rides, Event Expo, Fjallraven Hill Climb, SRAM shakeout rides, Pro Panel & Press Conference, Kids Race, Sponsor Appreciation Dinner, and post-event party. (https://www.bikeperfect.com/features/fnld-grvl-ride-report)

**Finish Area [ELITE observation]:** Graham Cottingham: "It was clear a lot of riders had given it their all as tired bodies milled around the finish area, inhaling their post-race meal and exhaling stories from the road." (https://www.bikeperfect.com/features/fnld-grvl-ride-report)

**International Draw:** "The event attracted riders from 27 countries. About a third of the participants had flown across from the US." (https://off-road.cc/content/feature/fnld-grvl-why-the-shortest-distance-is-often-the-sweetest-12795)

**Local Support:** "Quaint wooden houses painted either red or yellow were dotted along the course, their occupants at the side of the road waving and cheering riders on as they passed." (https://www.bikeperfect.com/features/fnld-grvl-ride-report)

**Prize Purse Equality:** "€20,000 equally split between the women's and men's podiums... as well as prize packs for the top three riders in all categories, including non-binary and para-cyclists, for both the 177km and 77km routes." (https://off-road.cc/content/feature/fnld-grvl-why-the-shortest-distance-is-often-the-sweetest-12795)

**Professional Field [ELITE observation]:** "10% of the field of riders being professionals" with notable pros including Toms Skujins (Trek-Segafredo), Tiffany Cromwell (Canyon-SRAM), Carolin Schiff (Unbound winner), and co-owner Valtteri Bottas (F1 driver). (https://www.keepitsimpelle.com/fnld-grvl-review/)

**Food & Coffee Culture:** Kahiwa Coffee Roasters provided coffee stops on course with "korvapuusti" (local pastry). Javi Angulo: "In the middle of nowhere, the people from Kahiwa Coffee Roasters had set a tent ready to provide us with the caffeine shots we needed." Post-race meals included at finish. (https://rawcyclingmag.com/fnld-grvl-a-premier-gravel-event-in-the-making/)

**Finnish Culture [COMPETITIVE observation]:** Miranda: "We named their steady gaze... the Long Stare. It might feel, initially, that the Finns are an unfriendly people as they do not automatically smile or return your wave. We discovered this to be deceptive, however, for once you make contact, and strike up a conversation, the Finns, in their perfect English, are very keen to laugh, joke and share a little bit about themselves." (https://www.sram.com/es/life/stories/here-there-everywhere-fnld-grvl)

**Midnight Sun Experience:** Miranda: "This was my first experience of visiting a country with 'the midnight sun' and living in a sort of Forever 2 pm was strange." The 177km race is named "Midnight Sun" after the almost constant sunlight in Finnish regions above the Arctic Circle in summer. (https://www.sram.com/es/life/stories/here-there-everywhere-fnld-grvl)

**Overall Vibe [ELITE assessment]:** Graham Cottingham: "FNLD GRVL has officially made its mark on the gravel racing circuit and could be a catalyst as the US becomes even more of an influence on European gravel, and the gravel racing scene as a whole. One thing is for sure though, if you are after flat-out gravel racing FNLD GRVL is fckng fst." (https://www.bikeperfect.com/features/fnld-grvl-ride-report)
