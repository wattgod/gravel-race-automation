## 2. RACE HISTORY & FOUNDING

### Origins Story

FNLD GRVL was born from a chance encounter between Formula 1 driver **Valtteri Bottas** and the American gravel racing scene. In 2021, Bottas participated in SBT GRVL in Steamboat Springs, Colorado, and was so impressed that he approached the organizers about bringing a similar event to his hometown of Lahti, Finland.

**Key Quote from Bottas:**
> "I've been riding gravel around my hometown of Lahti, Finland for years, and discovered SBT GRVL in Steamboat Springs, CO in 2021. I was impressed with such a world-class event... I talked with the organizers of SBT after last year's event and I just gave a hint that it could be something that we could do in Finland together and then we joined forces."

## 6. BLACK PILL - Honest Truths

### The Hard Realities

**1. Mosquitoes and Bugs**
- "Rakka" season (worst bugs) runs from Midsummer through end of July
- More swampy/marshy terrain = more mosquitoes
- Forests are worse than open areas
- Finnish mosquitoes don't spread diseases but are annoying
- Elk flies (deer flies) considered worse than mosquitoes by locals
- Ticks are present and can spread Lyme disease
- Close-fitting cycling clothes allow mosquitoes to bite through

**Mitigation:**
- Cycling at good pace keeps insects at bay
- FNLD GRVL timing in June/August avoids peak bug season
- Bring repellent
- Consider looser-fitting layers for before/after ride

**2. Cost Considerations**
- Finland is an expensive country
- VIP package alone is $1,000 USD
- Nordic countries have high accommodation and food costs
- Travel from North America requires long-haul flights

**3. Weather Unpredictability**
- Rain can happen any summer day
- Temperature swings of 15°C possible within same week
- Pack for all conditions

**4. Forest Road Variability**
- Some forest roads not regularly maintained
- Potential for washboard surfaces
- Short, steep gradients that zap speed
- Surface can change rapidly and unpredictably

**5. Participant Numbers Declining?**
- 2023: ~1,000 riders
- 2024: ~700 riders
- 2025: Event reimagined as "FNLD TRVL" (more casual)
- May indicate challenges with sustainable participation

**6. Competition with Other Events**
- Same SBT GRVL team runs events globally
- Nordic Gravel Series has multiple competing events
- Limited unique selling proposition beyond Bottas celebrity factor

**7. Relatively Flat Compared to Alpine Events**
- "Fast and furious" doesn't mean "epic climbing"
- Those seeking mountain gravel will find it tame
- ~650m elevation gain over 77km is not extreme
