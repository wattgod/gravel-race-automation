**Wendy Oosterwoud [ELITE]:** "Great way to end the season! Took the win today in Leuven! Will now take some time off of the bike and try to get back stronger next season" (https://www.cyclingnews.com/races/uci-gravel-world-series-events-2025/flanders-legacy-gravel/results/)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

The course is **48km local lap** with start in Heverlee and finish in Leuven city center (near the 2024 UCI Gravel Worlds finish). Elite/younger age groups ride 3 laps (147km), older categories 2 laps (96km).

**Elevation Profile:**
- 950m total gain for 147km distance (or 610m for 96km)
- Rolling hills throughout - "the inclines are never very steep"
- Course uses approximately 60% of the 2024 World Championships route
- Adds extra kilometers on south side in Wallonia
- Includes alternative section near the finish

The terrain is described as "rolling landscapes, challenging climbs, and sections over iconic gravel roads" traversing "the most beautiful gravel sectors in and around Leuven" (https://flanderslegacygravel.be/en/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**[ELITE] Race Dynamics:**
The men's elite race came down to a 12-rider group sprint after 147km, suggesting the course allows for group dynamics rather than pure individual time trial efforts. All top 5 men finished within 1 second, indicating pack tactics matter.

The women's race saw Oosterwoud create a 23-second gap, suggesting successful late-race attacks are possible but gaps don't grow large on this terrain.
