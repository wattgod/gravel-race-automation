# FLINT HILLS DEATH RIDE — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Burnsey [ELITE]:** "I was lucky to keep a 12 mph pace, and that was seriously making me spin like a gerbil on cocaine!" (riding severely under-geared on single speed 29er) "As it turns out, the 80+ miles of 'dirt' was nothing more than a gravel road ride. I can't believe I paid the big bucks for this so called race when in reality it was a group ride in the heat and dust of the Kansas plains. The finish line was non existent and a total let down; no cameras, no cheers, no cowbells...nothing." "They talk this ride up like its the most hardcore thing to do, and that only like 50-60% of the fittest riders even finish. Well, I am going to have to call bullshit on that one... Not a ride I'd recommend to a mountain biker...maybe to a roadie I don't like. I'd give this race a 1 out of 5, and that's just because all of the volunteers at the SAG stations were super nice and helpful!"

**Bill Stephenson [ELITE], Austin, TX (2003):** "This is the hardest thing I've ever done. Give me back my easy 12 hour mountain bike races." (https://autobus.cyclingnews.com/mtb.php?id=mtb%2F2003%2Faug03%2Faug31mtbUSAflinthills)

**Darin Slack [ELITE] (2003):** "The Death Ride changed me. It was a very sobering and maturing ride that challenged my emotions probably more than my muscles. My emotions ranged from joy to frustrations to anger to disbelief to satisfaction. It is definitely an accomplishment to be remembered." (https://autobus.cyclingnews.com/mtb.php?id=mtb%2F2003%2Faug03%2Faug31mtbUSAflinthills)

**Motocraftsman [UNKNOWN]:** "Fun Fact, The Death Ride began in Matfield Green, KS. John Hobbs would scare the s**t out of you before you even started. I don't remember much about encouraging words, or finish line hugs. I remember dehydration, sunburns, and a cool medal. It was only 62-ish miles but it was brutal. There was a local woman that rode a litespeed titanium road bike on the route in the mid-late 90's, and I believe she finished multiple events." (https://g-tedproductions.blogspot.com/2020/05/gravel-grinder-news-evidence-of-gravel.html)

**J.C. Van Deventer [UNKNOWN], Race Organizer (2003):** "The theme of the day was safety, surviving, and finishing. The new altered route had over 6,000 feet of climbing, as riders rode through old deserted ghost towns, oil fields, and cow pastures." "After a long day of trudging through the mud, rain, rocks, creeks, climbs, and descents only 31 riders made it to the finish line to be able to stack a claim to Flinthills Death Ride Finisher... The final finishers completed the route just before 7:00p.m., over 10 hours after they started. Each finisher was awarded first place, as this year's race was more about surviving and finishing than it was about beating your buddy." (https://autobus.cyclingnews.com/mtb.php?id=mtb%2F2003%2Faug03%2Faug31mtbUSAflinthills)

**John Hobbs [UNKNOWN], Race Founder:** "We got tired of reading how truly epic rides were only in places like California and Colorado. So we set up a ride that we knew that even under good conditions would test you, and under bad conditions would be nearly impossible." "No one has ever died. Some came close, a few thought they were gonna die, but they were weenies." (https://www.si.com/edge/2016/06/07/gravel-grinders-cycling-races-events-advice)

**Unknown commenter [UNKNOWN] (2010):** "I hope you didn't order a jersey. I paid 80 bucks and still haven't got mine. (middle of June 2010) The other ride this crew puts on got canceled this year. Hope those people have better luck getting a response out of Paul Corcoran, than I have, to get there money back. Been trying for over 3 months to contact him. He won't respond. redneck biker" (https://singlespeedpirate.blogspot.com/2009/07/flint-hills-death-ride.html)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Burnsey [ELITE]:** Rode a 29er single speed mountain bike, but was stuck with wrong gearing (couldn't change stripped bolt). Notes that being under-geared meant "spinning my brains out for 80+ miles, going slow at best." Finished around 3pm despite severely compromised setup. (https://singlespeedpirate.blogspot.com/2009/07/flint-hills-death-ride.html)

**Motocraftsman [UNKNOWN]:** Notes "a local woman that rode a litespeed titanium road bike on the route in the mid-late 90's, and I believe she finished multiple events" — suggesting road bikes were viable on the course. (https://g-tedproductions.blogspot.com/2020/05/gravel-grinder-news-evidence-of-gravel.html)

## Weather Experienced

**2003 Race:** Extreme weather year. "Late Saturday evening Interstate 35 was flooded at Jacobs Creek by the tremendous rains the Flinthills had received over the previous two days. Seven people, including four children, died as their cars were swept away." Race continued despite "intense downpour" throughout Saturday night into Sunday morning. Course described as "better suited for boats and ducks than mountain bikes." Featured a "forty-foot river crossing where the water had completely submerged the bridge." Final finishers completed just before 7pm, over 10 hours after 8:30am start. (https://autobus.cyclingnews.com/mtb.php?id=mtb%2F2003%2Faug03%2Faug31mtbUSAflinthills)

**2009 Race (Burnsey's year):** "perfect temps" for sleeping outside night before race. Started at 7:30am with "perfect temps." Later in day conditions deteriorated to "heat and dust of the Kansas plains." (https://singlespeedpirate.blogspot.com/2009/07/flint-hills-death-ride.html)

**General conditions noted:** Typical concerns were "dehydration, sunburns" according to repeat participant. Mid-summer Kansas heat was characteristic feature. (https://g-tedproductions.blogspot.com/2020/05/gravel-grinder-news-evidence-of-gravel.html)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Course Length Variations:** Reports vary on exact distance - described variously as "62-ish miles" (Motocraftsman), "70 mile loop" (UNDEAD Death Ride successor), "77.4 miles" (YouTube description), "80+ miles" (Burnsey), "85-mile event" (2003), and "metric century—roughly 70 miles" (SI.com article). Consensus appears to be approximately 70-85 miles depending on year.

**Elevation:** 2003 altered route had "over 6,000 feet of climbing." YouTube description mentions "5000' of elevation gain." (https://autobus.cyclingnews.com/mtb.php?id=mtb%2F2003%2Faug03%2Faug31mtbUSAflinthills, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpiDxLl8lEA)

**Surface & Features:** Described as "old gravel and dirt stagecoach roads through rugged countryside and ghost towns" with "rocky soils." Route went through "old deserted ghost towns, oil fields, and cow pastures." Burnsey notes it was "nothing more than a gravel road ride" (as opposed to singletrack). 2003 course required riders to navigate "mud, rain, rocks, creeks, climbs, and descents." (https://www.si.com/edge/2016/06/07/gravel-grinders-cycling-races-events-advice, https://autobus.cyclingnews.com/mtb.php?id=mtb%2F2003%2Faug03%2Faug31mtbUSAflinthills, https://singlespeedpirate.blogspot.com/2009/07/flint-hills-death-ride.html)

**Start Location:** Event began in Matfield Green, KS initially, later used Madison, KS as start point. The 70-mile loop format ran "between Madison and Matfield Green, KS." (https://g-tedproductions.blogspot.com/2020/05/gravel-grinder-news-evidence-of-gravel.html, https://discovergravel.com/the-undead-death-ride)

**Specific Challenge (2003):** "Only 10 miles into the 85-mile event the riders came to the first monumental task. It was a forty-foot river crossing where the water had completely submerged the bridge. The riders dismounted to walk across and support people stood in the river to help catch any riders that fell." (https://autobus.cyclingnews.com/mtb.php?id=mtb%2F2003%2Faug03%2Faug31mtbUSAflinthills)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Burnsey [ELITE]:** Despite being severely under-geared and forced to maintain only 12 mph pace while "spinning like a gerbil on cocaine," still finished around 3pm with companion Garret riding along at that pace. Noted he was "lucky to keep a 12 mph pace" but this was due to equipment failure, not capability. (https://singlespeedpirate.blogspot.com/2009/07/flint-hills-death-ride.html)

**2003 Winners [ELITE]:** Fastest finishers in the extreme weather/flood year still took over 10 hours for the modified 85-mile course, finishing just before 7pm from 8:30am start. This gives context that even elite riders in bad conditions averaged under 9 mph. (https://autobus.cyclingnews.com/mtb.php?id=mtb%2F2003%2Faug03%2Faug31mtbUSAflinthills)

**SAG Support:** Multiple SAG stations existed on course with volunteers providing support. Course was NOT completely self-supported. (https://singlespeedpirate.blogspot.com/2009/07/flint-hills-death-ride.html)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Historical DNF Rate:** Organizer John Hobbs warned "at least 60% of the riders wouldn't finish" pre-race. However, Burnsey [ELITE] disputed this: "They talk this ride up like its the most hardcore thing to do, and that only like 50-60% of the fittest riders even finish. Well, I am going to have to call bullshit on that one." (https://singlespeedpirate.blogspot.com/2009/07/flint-hills-death-ride.html, https://www.si.com/edge/2016/06/07/gravel-grinders-cycling-races-events-advice)

**2003 Extreme Weather Year:** Out of field that started, "only 31 riders made it to the finish line." Many abandoned at the 10-mile flooded bridge crossing. "All the riders made it across safely and no one abandoned at this point" at the first river crossing, suggesting attrition happened later. "There were no major injuries or deaths." (https://autobus.cyclingnews.com/mtb.php?id=mtb%2F2003%2Faug03%2Faug31mtbUSAflinthills)

**Mechanical Issues:** Course conditions could break bikes - in 2003, rider report mentions "bikes clogged and broken by some of the stickiest, grossest slop" in mud sections. "I passed at least a half dozen people, bikes already broken beyond repair, calling their spouses or partners or friends to figure out how far they had to walk to get picked up, their day and dream over." (https://defector.com/i-got-my-ass-kicked-by-americas-dirtiest-bike-race)

**Dehydration:** Primary stated concern from multiple riders was "dehydration, sunburns" in the mid-summer Kansas heat. (https://g-tedproductions.blogspot.com/2020/05/gravel-grinder-news-evidence-of-gravel.html)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Finish Line Experience - Mixed Reviews:**

**Burnsey [ELITE]:** "The finish line was non existent and a total let down; no cameras, no cheers, no cowbells...nothing. I had to ask around town just to see where I was to go and if I needed to check in somewhere. Weird and a total let-down after riding all that way successfully." (https://singlespeedpirate.blogspot.com/2009/07/flint-hills-death-ride.html)

**2003 (Extreme Weather Year):** "All of the finishers were awarded the same prize, a wood carver medallion with a picture of a cow's skull. The final finishers completed the route just before 7:00p.m., over 10 hours after they started. Each finisher was awarded first place, as this year's race was more about surviving and finishing than it was about beating your buddy." (https://autobus.cyclingnews.com/mtb.php?id=mtb%2F2003%2Faug03%2Faug31mtbUSAflinthills)

**General Medal:** Standard finisher award was "a cool medal" per repeat participant. (https://g-tedproductions.blogspot.com/2020/05/gravel-grinder-news-evidence-of-gravel.html)

**SAG Volunteers:** "All of the volunteers at the SAG stations were super nice and helpful!" - this was the one positive Burnsey cited in his otherwise critical review. (https://singlespeedpirate.blogspot.com/2009/07/flint-hills-death-ride.html)

**Pre-Race Atmosphere:** "John Hobbs would scare the s**t out of you before you even started. I don't remember much about encouraging words, or finish line hugs." Race organizer's style was intimidation rather than encouragement. (https://g-tedproductions.blogspot.com/2020/05/gravel-grinder-news-evidence-of-gravel.html)

**Event Status:** Race is no longer held. Original Flint Hills Death Ride started in 1988 (some sources say 1993), ran until 2010. "At its peak the Flint Hills Death Ride saw over 400 riders take part in it." Modern successor is "The UNDEAD Death Ride" created "in memory of the Flint Hills Death Ride" as a "simple group ride through the Flint Hills of Kansas... purely to be used as a fun ride showing off some amazing roads." The UNDEAD version explicitly states "Discover Gravel LLC is not associated in any way with the FHDR. I simply am a fan of local gravel history." (https://g-tedproductions.blogspot.com/2020/05/gravel-grinder-news-evidence-of-gravel.html, https://discovergravel.com/the-undead-death-ride)

**Historical Significance:** The Flint Hills Death Ride was one of the pioneering gravel events, mentioned alongside Trans Iowa and Dirty Kanza (now Unbound) as influential in the development of modern gravel racing. It was "modeled off of similar rides Trans-Iowa and the Flint Hills Death Ride" according to Dirty Kanza origin story.
