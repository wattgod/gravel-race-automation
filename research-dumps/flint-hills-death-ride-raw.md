# FLINT HILLS DEATH RIDE - RAW RESEARCH DUMP

## CRITICAL FINDING: RACE NAME DISCREPANCY

Based on my search results, I cannot locate a race called the **"Flint Hills Death Ride"** in Kansas. However, I found a very similar event with nearly identical branding: **"The UNDEAD Death Ride,"** which operates in the same Kansas gravel region[2][3].

The search results show multiple Flint Hills gravel events in Kansas, but none match the specific name "Flint Hills Death Ride" with the Cottonwood Falls, Kansas location you specified.

## NEXT STEPS FOR ACCURATE RESEARCH

1. **Verify the correct race name** — The "Flint Hills Death Ride" may be a local or colloquial name not widely indexed online, or it may be a smaller, unofficial event.

2. **Check if this is a historic race** — If the race no longer runs, you may need to search archived versions of race websites or cycling forums from previous years.

3. **Search by location directly** — Searching "Cottonwood Falls Kansas gravel race" or "Cottonwood Falls cycling" may yield results if the race exists under a different name.

4. **Consult local cycling communities** — Kansas gravel cycling forums, Facebook groups, or the Flint Hills cycling community may have direct information.

I cannot fabricate race details. If you can provide additional context about the race (alternate names, sponsorships, year it was held, or a direct link), I can conduct more targeted research.
