## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

### South Dakota Gold Rush/Fools Gold Events

**Michael Leach [ELITE]:** "I originally planned on riding the 76 miler but knew the average ride time of 6+ hours was going to be pushing me well beyond my 4 hour weekly long ride. Being a spondy athlete and battling overuse injuries means making smarter choices... I changed plans from the 76 miler to the 50ish miler... Max (a UCI top 150 Junior) was the first to attack... For the next 50 minutes the three of us rode together, pushing 300 watts (according to Max)... We hit the pavement 2 hours and 50 minutes into our ride... I hit the finish line in 3 hours and 21 minutes, 4th overall, and 3rd in the men's division." (https://beaudacious.com/fools-gold-gravel-grinder/)

**Michael Leach [ELITE]:** "Before every ride I repeat this mantra to myself: ride smart, ride safe, ride strong... Max (the young gun) and I shared some big heart rate numbers, with me averaging 165 HR (he was at 160 HR) for 3 hours and 21 minutes and each of us topping out at 183 heart rate max." (https://beaudacious.com/fools-gold-gravel-grinder/)

**Michael Leach [ELITE]:** "We flew down the 14-mile(ish) gravel descent still mashing on our pedals, knowing we were being chased, but having no clue how far behind our pursuers were... In total, we climbed for 2 hours and 20 minutes over the course of 27 miles and covering nearly 3800 feet of elevation." (https://beaudacious.com/fools-gold-gravel-grinder/)

### Georgia Fool's Gold MTB Race (Different Event)

**Race description [UNKNOWN]:** "Both courses begin at Montaluce Winery and will have a neutral rollout for approximately 3 miles on pavement, then transition to gravel roads. The 54 mile course begins with a stout 3 mile gravel road climb... Much of the singletrack is newly re-constructed and flowy, with an assortment of fast gradual climbs to short grunts." (https://www.mountaingoatadventures.com/foolsgold)

**Course description [UNKNOWN]:** "In terms of technical difficulty, the majority of the course is intermediate, with a few short, advanced sections throughout the course... This course has a good mix of all trail types and does not cater to any one particular style of rider, though fitness is rewarded due to the abundance of climbing."

## Weather Experienced

**Michael Leach [ELITE] - 2021:** "It's Perry's early morning rooster calls that first captured my attention...

**Gold Rush Virtual Ride - June 6, 2020 [UNKNOWN]:** "The wind was ESE 20-30 MPH gusting to 45 MPH. It took me 4 hours." (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xp3FldLK9bU)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

### South Dakota Event

**Michael Leach [ELITE]:** "After I lost contact with Max, my NH comrade and I gave it all we had. In total, we climbed for 2 hours and 20 minutes over the course of 27 miles and covering nearly 3800 feet of elevation. When we hit the aid station, the volunteer crew was fired up telling me, 'You're second,' and on we went. We flew down the 14-mile(ish) gravel descent still mashing on our pedals." (https://beaudacious.com/fools-gold-gravel-grinder/)

**Michael Leach [ELITE]:** "On a drop bar mountain bike with fat (by gravel standards) 29er tires and a 1×11 drivetrain, I knew the last 14 miles on pavement would be the worst, and I quickly lost contact with Howard." (https://beaudacious.com/fools-gold-gravel-grinder/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Michael Leach [ELITE] - 50-mile race, 3:21 finish:** "I marked a female racer from Boulder, CO, as a top five finisher and thought I'd try and hang on her wheel, but when nobody else went with the 2-man breakaway, I thought 'What would Kamiah do?' and I closed the gap and joined the lead two. For the next 50 minutes the three of us rode together, pushing 300 watts... We hit the pavement 2 hours and 50 minutes into our ride." (https://beaudacious.com/fools-gold-gravel-grinder/)

**Michael Leach [ELITE] - Heart rate data:** "Max (the young gun) and I shared some big heart rate numbers, with me averaging 165 HR (he was at 160 HR) for 3 hours and 21 minutes and each of us topping out at 183 heart rate max." (https://beaudacious.com/fools-gold-gravel-grinder/)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Michael Leach [ELITE]:** "I've got to give it to the race organizers of the Gold Rush, Perry and Kristi Jewett, who really know how to put on a great event–talk about a good vibes gravel grinder. It's Perry's early morning rooster calls that first captured my attention when watching their four-minute promotional video (one I've probably watched over a dozen times, the best promo video of any of our regional gravel events, hands down)." (https://beaudacious.com/fools-gold-gravel-grinder/)

**Michael Leach [ELITE]:** "The Fools Gold was a new race distance for this event and without it, I wouldn't have shared this experience with my wife and daughter (who are ready to make it an annual ritual), I wouldn't have fallen for Spearfish (one of my best friends, a South Dakota boy through and through sent me Black Elk's Prayer)." (https://beaudacious.com/fools-gold-gravel-grinder/)

**Michael Leach [ELITE]:** "The smile at the finish says it all... This story and experience wasn't about the numbers; it was about exploring an area sacred to the Lakota people on a bike, being with my girls, connecting with people from across the region who like us, love to ride bikes."
