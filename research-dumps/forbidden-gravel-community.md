# FORBIDDEN GRAVEL — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Craig Richey [ELITE]:** "From my days of cross-country mountain bike racing, I became aware of race economy; covering the same ground at the same speed but with less effort... My race plan for the Forbidden Gravel Experience was exactly that; push hard on the climbs (where the big-time gaps could be made), then descend as fast and as safe as possible while recovering." (https://eastoncycling.com/blogs/news/can-gravel-suspension-help-you-climb-faster)

**Craig Richey [ELITE]:** "In the end I crossed the line almost 14 minutes ahead of the next rider with a bit of gas left in the tank. Not bad for the longest and hardest ride so far this year." Distance: 104km, Time: 5:07:18, Avg Speed: 20.2 kph, Avg Power: 170W, Normalized Power: 216W, Elevation Gain: 2265m, Place: 6th (https://eastoncycling.com/blogs/news/can-gravel-suspension-help-you-climb-faster)

**Chad Grice [RECREATIONAL]:** "For me this race has always been about reducing mechanicals and moving efficentently. This years edition had an entirely new route which cut out the out and back on the north side of Comox Lake and added forbidden plateau." (https://bookofchad.ca/2023/06/22/forbidden-gravel-experiance/)

**Chad Grice [RECREATIONAL]:** "The second climb of the day was by far the most outrageous climb I have done in a gravel race. With Dave, his teammate and I starting the over 1000m climb together I knew it was going to be a real struggle. We got to a steep and loose section and both had to dismount resulting in an awkward walking race. I wasn't racing Dave or anyone else at this point I was in a fight with myself to suffer and to ride as much as possible and just keep pacing and eating. I must have gotten off my bike a dozen times during the climb." (https://bookofchad.ca/2023/06/22/forbidden-gravel-experiance/)

**Chad Grice [RECREATIONAL]:** "Onto the decent it start as the craziest loosest scarriest decent I have ever done. At the speed I was going I was sliding all over the place and it felt more like surfing the riding. That first section lasted about a km and a half then it was onto the fast long gravel decent. This is some goosebump, hair raising stuff with speeds from 60kph to peaks in the high 80kph." Final stats: Distance: 104km, Time: 5:07:18, Avg Speed: 20.2 kph, Avg Power: 170W, Normalized Power: 216W, Elevation Gain: 2265m, Place: 6th (https://bookofchad.ca/2023/06/22/forbidden-gravel-experiance/)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Craig Richey [ELITE]:** Used a "gravity gravel build" featuring:
- Fox 32 Taper-Cast fork with 40mm of travel
- Fox Transfer SL dropper post with 70mm of drop
- Easton EC90 AX flared carbon bars
- EC90 AX wheels with Schwalbe 45c mid-tread tires inflated to 25psi front and rear

He noted: "Reducing fatigue on the descents with this build gave me an edge on the subsequent climbs... It was also clear on the first descent that my bike setup was more stable, allowing me to increase my lead further on the descents." (https://eastoncycling.com/blogs/news/can-gravel-suspension-help-you-climb-faster)

**Craig Richey [ELITE]:** On weight vs. function: "Many casual racers (with busy lives) are in a similar situation and may be tempted to run the lightest gear possible in order to make up for any fitness deficiencies. But weight savings will only get you so far. On gravel courses with long climbs and long descents, function and utility play an increasingly important role."

(Multiple sources confirm these distances)

**Specific Terrain Features:**

**Chad Grice [RECREATIONAL]:** "The first pinch point of the race would be a right turn into some fast single track... We entered the single track with Craig Richey leading John Vanderveen, then Cory and myself." (https://bookofchad.ca/2023/06/22/forbidden-gravel-experiance/)

**Chad Grice [RECREATIONAL]:** On the major climb: "The second climb of the day was by far the most outrageous climb I have done in a gravel race... over 1000m climb... We got to a steep and loose section and both had to dismount resulting in an awkward walking race." (https://bookofchad.ca/2023/06/22/forbidden-gravel-experiance/)

**Chad Grice [RECREATIONAL]:** On the descent: "Onto the decent it start as the craziest loosest scarriest decent I have ever done. At the speed I was going I was sliding all over the place and it felt more like surfing the riding. That first section lasted about a km and a half then it was onto the fast long gravel decent... speeds from 60kph to peaks in the high 80kph." (https://bookofchad.ca/2023/06/22/forbidden-gravel-experiance/)

**Chad Grice [RECREATIONAL]:** "We cross a river there are shallow options if you go on either side of the crossing and tip-toe around, I prefer the direct approach straight through the center." (https://bookofchad.ca/2023/06/22/forbidden-gravel-experiance/)

**Course Makeup:**
- "The initial 50km consisted of somewhat hilly gravel roads followed by 15km of motorbike single-track. The last 40km had three sizable climbs (each over 500m)" (https://eastoncycling.com/blogs/news/can-gravel-suspension-help-you-climb-faster)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Craig Richey [ELITE - averaging 6hrs/week training]:** "My race plan for the Forbidden Gravel Experience was exactly that; push hard on the climbs (where the big-time gaps could be made), then descend as fast and as safe as possible while recovering. Anyone who has white-knuckled down a rough and twisting fire road at 50kph on a gravel bike probably didn't feel particularly rested at the bottom. This is where equipment selection came into play." Result: 104km in 5:07:18, 170W average/216W normalized, 14 minutes ahead of 2nd place. (https://eastoncycling.com/blogs/news/can-gravel-suspension-help-you-climb-faster)

**Chad Grice [RECREATIONAL]:** "I wasn't racing Dave or anyone else at this point I was in a fight with myself to suffer and to ride as much as possible and just keep pacing and eating. I must have gotten off my bike a dozen times during the climb." Same distance (104km) but emphasis on survival pacing and consistent eating during the massive climb. (https://bookofchad.ca/2023/06/22/forbidden-gravel-experiance/)

**Key Tactical Note:** "The initial 50km whittled the front of the field down to just five riders in the lead pack. There were a few attacks, but I knew I could fend them off if I executed my race plan properly and didn't have any flats or mechanicals." [ELITE perspective] (https://eastoncycling.com/blogs/news/can-gravel-suspension-help-you-climb-faster)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Fire Risk & Event Postponement:** The 2025 edition was postponed from Sept 7 to Sept 21 due to fire danger: "Due to the worsening fire risk, we have been recently informed by one of the land owners that we are not permitted to have motorized vehicles access certain areas of the course, which are critical to our safety emergency first response and communication plan." (https://cyclingbc.net/event/forbidden-gravel-experience-2025/)

**Mechanical Risk on Descents:** Chad Grice [RECREATIONAL] noted: "The hardest part of these type of sections for me is coming up on the medium distance competitors who are having a great day out and here I am racing down this hill. I always call out well ahead to people and I always take the less desirable line when passing but it is a bit scary not knowing how they will react as I approach sometimes double the speed they are travelling at." (https://bookofchad.ca/2023/06/22/forbidden-gravel-experiance/)

**Puncture Risk:** Craig Richey [ELITE] mentioned: "There were a few attacks, but I knew I could fend them off if I executed my race plan properly and didn't have any flats or mechanicals." Dave's teammate got a puncture on the major climb. (https://eastoncycling.com/blogs/news/can-gravel-suspension-help-you-climb-faster)
