# FUEGO XL — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Rachel Hwang [COMPETITIVE]:** "Coming off being sick, I hadn't been able to train for long distance and my respiratory system had taken a hit. I entered with the women's elite field, and I felt like I had no business being there. As soon as the beep went off at 9:05:30, the 40+ women sped off, and already I could barely keep up." (https://www.altovelo.org/blog/race-report-2024-sea-otter-classic-fuego-xl)

**Rachel Hwang [COMPETITIVE]:** "While the first lap went ok, as soon as the second lap started, I bonked. When my legs were pedaling with the power it knew it could on the first lap, my lungs felt closed and I couldn't breathe fully, and because I haven't been able to do a long ride in the past month, on the second lap, my legs weren't up to the challenge and I started cramping." (https://www.altovelo.org/blog/race-report-2024-sea-otter-classic-fuego-xl)

**Rachel Hwang [COMPETITIVE]:** "First lap went ok, finishing in about 2 hours 55 minutes... I finished around 6 hours 15 minutes, about an hour slower than what I predicated I could do." (https://www.altovelo.org/blog/race-report-2024-sea-otter-classic-fuego-xl)

**Rachel Hwang [COMPETITIVE]:** "For the first time, my stomach started rejecting the nutrition, probably because I was still sick(?) but that was an interesting note I took with me from this race." (https://www.altovelo.org/blog/race-report-2024-sea-otter-classic-fuego-xl)

**Michael Van Den Ham [ELITE]:** "After trying to go with the eventual winner, Alex Wild, when he attacked at the end of the first lap, I started to crack a little and settled in for a rather uncomfortable second lap with a fellow Canadian, Carter Nieuwesteeg and Aussie, Brent Rees. I'm not going to lie, there were more than a few moments when I thought I was going to get blown out of the group I was racing and end up somewhere way back there." (https://www.wolftoothcomponents.com/blogs/news/michael-van-den-ham-fuego-xl-race-recap)

**Michael Van Den Ham [ELITE]:** "I headed to Sea Otter this year not with racing as my main focus, but to connect with the partners, sponsors, and friends who make my season possible. After a packed winter of coaching cyclocross in Europe, I wasn't feeling quite dialed in for the kind of high-level prep that the Lifetime Grand Prix gravel race demands. Instead, I chose to line up for the Fuego XL MTB race." Finished 3rd in 4:14:48. (https://www.wolftoothcomponents.com/blogs/news/michael-van-den-ham-fuego-xl-race-recap)

**Keegan Swenson [ELITE]:** "In the first race of the year you never really know where your fitness is at so it was good to have a hard and tactical race today. There was a pretty large group for the first lap and a half and not many guys were willing to do the work on the front. That meant we were fighting for the technical and singletrack sections, and it took a while for Matt [Beers], Alexey [Vermeulen] and I to create a gap and then work together for a bit." (https://www.cxmagazine.com/keegan-swenson-sofia-gomez-2024-sea-otter-fuego-xl-results-report)

**Sofia Gomez Villafane [ELITE]:** "Last year I remember leading on the first singletrack descent and getting a gap, so I put in a big push at the top of the tarmac and build a pretty big lead again and decided to run with it. Alexis Skarda was able to bridge up at the end of lap one and we worked together until I felt she was hurting." Won by 3 minutes 40 seconds. (https://www.cxmagazine.com/keegan-swenson-sofia-gomez-2024-sea-otter-fuego-xl-results-report)

**Hannah Otto [COMPETITIVE]:** "After pre-riding a lap earlier in the week, I actually had to take a step back, re-evaluate my plan, and anticipate a much longer race than I initially thought. Long isn't a bad thing, but you have to treat it with complete and total respect. Even though the race would last approximately five hours, the race would be extremely tactical – and the start, extremely critical." (https://firstendurance.com/blogs/articles/2023-sea-otter-classic-fuego-xl-race-report)

**Hannah Otto [COMPETITIVE]:** "As planned, I put in a big dig off of the start line, accelerating toward the singletrack as if it was a short XCO race rather than an all-day marathon grind. I entered the singletrack in 5th place. I felt good about my position initially, but I quickly realized that 'good' would not be 'good enough' in this instance. A gap formed between the front three riders and myself." (https://firstendurance.com/blogs/articles/2023-sea-otter-classic-fuego-xl-race-report)

**Hannah Otto [COMPETITIVE]:** "At mile 50, my race changed. We were descending a small portion of singletrack and I was riding closely on the wheel of the rider in front of me and I didn't see a rock until it was too late. My wheel slammed into the rock, I hit rim, and I heard all of the air exit my tire... After waiting for CO2s and fixing the flat, 12 minutes had passed. I had fallen back to 14th place." Eventually finished 9th, 6th among Grand Prix athletes. (https://firstendurance.com/blogs/articles/2023-sea-otter-classic-fuego-xl-race-report)

**Brendan 'Trekky' Johnston [ELITE]:** "I'd been out there (in Leadville) for three weeks, and ridden down Powerline probably ten times. I was following Torbjørn, which was fine — he's a good rider — and it just happened that he passed this rock, and it dislodged from the bank and tumbled across the track. It didn't even hurt my rear tyre; it just smashed into my rear wheel. It was like a big boulder, and it just destroyed my wheel, instantly." Race ended at ~30km into the 165km Leadville race. (https://flowmountainbike.com/features/brendan-trekky-johnston-on-racing-the-lifetime-grand-prix/)

**webdev511 [COMPETITIVE]:** "Really great course. I haven't had my Scalpel for a year yet, but the more I get it dialed in, the faster I can go and the more fun I have. Fort Ord is a great place to do it." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/sea-otter-classic-2023-fuego-la-gravilla-et-al/82332)

**Jolyzara [UNKNOWN]:** "I will say this… once the course gets on craters (one of my favorites) it is back on track to near perfect... As mentioned it is a tough course. I don't think anyone will hit the sub 3 hour mark for the gold corral at Leadville." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/sea-otter-classic-2023-fuego-la-gravilla-et-al/82332)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Tire Choices:**

**Rachel Hwang [COMPETITIVE]:** Crashed early on lap one, "have to give a shout out to the Eliel kit for not ripping." (https://www.altovelo.org/blog/race-report-2024-sea-otter-classic-fuego-xl)

**webdev511 [COMPETITIVE]:** "Well I ran the Ray/Ralf combo and they were great. there are lots of sand washes and it's still going to have a fair number of mud crossings too. I reconsidered running Thunder Burts, that won't happen." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/sea-otter-classic-2023-fuego-la-gravilla-et-al/82332)

**fidracer [UNKNOWN] asking about tire choice:** "Would you say that the course is still suited for a fast XC tire (Aspen, Race King, Fast Trak/Renegade, etc.), or do the likely conditions warrant something else?" Response from webdev511 indicated conditions warranted more aggressive tires. (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/sea-otter-classic-2023-fuego-la-gravilla-et-al/82332)

**Bike Setup:**

**Rachel Hwang [COMPETITIVE]:** "My Garmin snapped right off the mount" during a crash. (https://www.altovelo.org/blog/race-report-2024-sea-otter-classic-fuego-xl)

**Hannah Otto [COMPETITIVE]:** Flatted at mile 50, tire wouldn't seal with CO2 because "the flat was on the bead. I tried to use a tire plug, but it wouldn't hold." Eventually got a tube from another rider. "The flat would continue to slow leak the rest of the race." (https://firstendurance.com/blogs/articles/2023-sea-otter-classic-fuego-xl-race-report)

**Drop Bars Rule Change [ELITE LEVEL]:** Official Sea Otter info states: "Drop Bars No drop bars – For rider safety and course compatibility, drop-style handlebars (road or gravel bars with drops) are not longer permitted for the Fuego XL and Fuego XC. All competitors must use flat or riser-style handlebars. This rule will be enforced during pre-race inspections and on course; violations may result in disqualification." (https://www.seaotterclassic.com/cross-country/)

**webdev511 [COMPETITIVE]:** Debating between XC bike and gravel bike for the course: "MTB has full bounce, less aero, smaller water bottle capacity (2x500ml vs 2x800), wider tires (Nanos are my tire of choice for the course in a 53mm vs 40mm)." Ultimately leaning XC for technical sections. (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/sea-otter-classic-2023-fuego-la-gravilla-et-al/82332)

## Weather Experienced

**March 2023 Pre-Ride Conditions [webdev511, COMPETITIVE]:** "It's still going to have lots of wet and goopy parts. I think there was only one puddle/crossing that was so deep it stopped my momentum. The rest just required one to keep a good spin going until the other side. Lots of places where there is water running right down the middle of the trail." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/sea-otter-classic-2023-fuego-la-gravilla-et-al/82332)

**March 2023 Conditions [Jolyzara, UNKNOWN]:** "Vernal pools are full and overflowing onto the trails in some places (trail 18, 57, 56, etc). Other places it is straight up hero dirt. Expect LOTS of ruts and sand (because, well, that's Fort Ord) but if we get a break in the rain the trails could very well be the best you'll ever see out here. If we get hit by a few more atmospheric rivers expect a muddy mess." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/sea-otter-classic-2023-fuego-la-gravilla-et-al/82332)

**March 2023 Bike Condition After One Lap [webdev511, COMPETITIVE]:** Posted photo showing bike completely caked in mud after single lap pre-ride. (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/sea-otter-classic-2023-fuego-la-gravilla-et-al/82332)

**April 2023 Pre-Ride [webdev511, COMPETITIVE]:** "Did another pre-ride, this time of the La Gravilla course... Overall conditions are much drier with the exception of low points that are all gonna still have mud and puddles even two weeks from now." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/sea-otter-classic-2023-fuego-la-gravilla-et-al/82332)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Course Overview [Official]:** "Approximately 70 miles and 7,800 feet of elevation change" over 2 laps. "The boiling point is set at approximately 21 miles for this traditional cross country course that gains 3,500 feet" for single lap XC version. (https://www.seaotterclassic.com/cross-country/)

**Course Description [Official]:** "The Fuego presented by Specialized tests the fire of each athlete by way of sandy climbs and flowy singletrack of the Fort Ord National Monument." (https://www.seaotterclassic.com/cross-country/)

**Rachel Hwang [COMPETITIVE]:** "The course was very much XC style, with the singletrack being very mellow, hard packed dirt, and flowy with nothing technical, and with decent gravel roads." (https://www.altovelo.org/blog/race-report-2024-sea-otter-classic-fuego-xl)

**Rachel Hwang [COMPETITIVE]:** "The first bit is on the track road to thin out the herd, up a steepish incline, headed straight into singletrack." (https://www.altovelo.org/blog/race-report-2024-sea-otter-classic-fuego-xl)

**webdev511 [COMPETITIVE]:** "Second part of the course has a LOT of deep speed sucking sand washes. Like a dozen at least. There's one stretch about mile 25 where you take a hard left off of a fire road descent BOOM 200m sand wash right into a climb." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/sea-otter-classic-2023-fuego-la-gravilla-et-al/82332)

**webdev511 [COMPETITIVE]:** "Ruts on longer descents and climbs going parallel with the trail. There was one descent like that where there was a single line. The rest of the drop is just crap and it's going to freak less experienced riders out. The rutted climbs are going to be a handful. as they do have a couple of lines, but you're gonna need to keep momentum as some of them are steep enough that a bump you don't have enough to keep rolling over, you're not going to be able to just remount in the middle of that particular freakshow." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/sea-otter-classic-2023-fuego-la-gravilla-et-al/82332)

**webdev511 [COMPETITIVE]:** "Passing opportunities on singletrack = slim to none. You do it, it's going to be a ballsy move." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/sea-otter-classic-2023-fuego-la-gravilla-et-al/82332)

**webdev511 [COMPETITIVE]:** "The last 2.7 mile climb is going to be the test. about the first half of it is a sand wash riddled single track climb, that will drop you on to the same final fire road climb as last year, but the fire road is ultra rutted with a couple sections that have a single line because the road is best described as gone with ruts that are about 5 feet deep." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/sea-otter-classic-2023-fuego-la-gravilla-et-al/82332)

**Jolyzara [UNKNOWN]:** Critical of course design: "XL course is good… could be better. I will say they got the first 11 miles right but then starts skipping some of the best trails in the park for cement road. Why ride down on Jacks road instead of descending Red Rocks? Why then go up Jacks instead of going up and over 49 to 82?" (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/sea-otter-classic-2023-fuego-la-gravilla-et-al/82332)

**Jolyzara [UNKNOWN]:** "One of the worst parts is they have you going up 69. It's a rutted beach. I guess if you like a mile of off & on uphill sand you'll enjoy the challenge." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/sea-otter-classic-2023-fuego-la-gravilla-et-al/82332)

**webdev511 [COMPETITIVE]:** On the additional sand section: "this added section SUuuuuuuuCKS so much. It was tough just going through once, it's going to be a real test with 50 miles in the legs." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/sea-otter-classic-2023-fuego-la-gravilla-et-al/82332)

**Hannah Otto [COMPETITIVE]:** "The race started up a wide open race track, then about three minutes in, it entered into a long singletrack descent with little to no passing. As planned, I put in a big dig off of the start line, accelerating toward the singletrack as if it was a short XCO race rather than an all-day marathon grind." (https://firstendurance.com/blogs/articles/2023-sea-otter-classic-fuego-xl-race-report)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Start Positioning [Hannah Otto, COMPETITIVE]:** "After pre-riding a lap earlier in the week, I actually had to take a step back, re-evaluate my plan, and anticipate a much longer race than I initially thought... Even though the race would last approximately five hours, the race would be extremely tactical – and the start, extremely critical." (https://firstendurance.com/blogs/articles/2023-sea-otter-classic-fuego-xl-race-report)

**Start Positioning [Hannah Otto, COMPETITIVE]:** "The race started up a wide open race track, then about three minutes in, it entered into a long singletrack descent with little to no passing... I entered the singletrack in 5th place. I felt good about my position initially, but I quickly realized that 'good' would not be 'good enough' in this instance. A gap formed between the front three riders and myself." Critical to be in top group before singletrack. (https://firstendurance.com/blogs/articles/2023-sea-otter-classic-fuego-xl-race-report)

**Elite Race Dynamics [Keegan Swenson, ELITE]:** "There was a pretty large group for the first lap and a half and not many guys were willing to do the work on the front. That meant we were fighting for the technical and singletrack sections, and it took a while for Matt [Beers], Alexey [Vermeulen] and I to create a gap and then work together for a bit. I managed to break clear from them on the descent to the final climb and then extend my lead into the finish." (https://www.cxmagazine.com/keegan-swenson-sofia-gomez-2024-sea-otter-fuego-xl-results-report)

**Elite Women's Race [Sofia Gomez Villafane, ELITE]:** "Last year I remember leading on the first singletrack descent and getting a gap, so I put in a big push at the top of the tarmac and build a pretty big lead again and decided to run with it. Alexis Skarda was able to bridge up at the end of lap one and we worked together until I felt she was hurting. I wondered if it might be too early to go but thought I'd give it a shot." Attacked with over 40 miles remaining, won by 3:40. (https://www.cxmagazine.com/keegan-swenson-sofia-gomez-2024-sea-otter-fuego-xl-results-report)

**Nutrition Strategy [Rachel Hwang, COMPETITIVE]:** "~500ml per hour of nutrition, and a gel per hour, and half a bar after lap 1." However, noted: "For the first time, my stomach started rejecting the nutrition, probably because I was still sick(?)." (https://www.altovelo.org/blog/race-report-2024-sea-otter-classic-fuego-xl)

**Pacing Reality Check [Rachel Hwang, COMPETITIVE]:** "First lap went ok, finishing in about 2 hours 55 minutes... While the first lap went ok, as soon as the second lap started, I bonked." Emphasizes difficulty of maintaining pace across two laps. (https://www.altovelo.org/blog/race-report-2024-sea-otter-classic-fuego-xl)

**Time Cutoffs [Official]:** "All participants must start their 2nd lap by 2pm. Course closure for qualifying is at 4pm." (https://www.seaotterclassic.com/cross-country/)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Mechanical Failures:**

**Hannah Otto [COMPETITIVE]:** Flatted at mile 50, "My wheel slammed into the rock, I hit rim, and I heard all of the air exit my tire... the flat was on the bead. I tried to use a tire plug, but it wouldn't hold. I burnt through my two CO2s, and now I was a sitting duck. Minutes had rolled by, and now I was starting to see other women pass me by." Lost 12 minutes to the incident, dropped from podium contention to 14th before clawing back to 9th. (https://firstendurance.com/blogs/articles/2023-sea-otter-classic-fuego-xl-race-report)

**Brendan Johnston [ELITE]:** Race-ending wheel destruction ~30km into Leadville: "It just happened that he passed this rock, and it dislodged from the bank and tumbled across the track. It didn't even hurt my rear tyre; it just smashed into my rear wheel. It was like a big boulder, and it just destroyed my wheel, instantly." (https://flowmountainbike.com/features/brendan-trekky-johnston-on-racing-the-lifetime-grand-prix/)

**Rachel Hwang [COMPETITIVE]:** "My Garmin snapped right off the mount" during crash. Also crashed "from a rut where multiple people crashed." (https://www.altovelo.org/blog/race-report-2024-sea-otter-classic-fuego-xl)

**Physical Issues:**

**Rachel Hwang [COMPETITIVE]:** "Coming off being sick, I hadn't been able to train for long distance and my respiratory system had taken a hit... on the second lap, my legs weren't up to the challenge and I started cramping. I pedaled slow as when I started putting power down my right quad would cramp." Also: "For the first time, my stomach started rejecting the nutrition." (https://www.altovelo.org/blog/race-report-2024-sea-otter-classic-fuego-xl)

**Course Hazards:**

**webdev511 [COMPETITIVE]:** "Ruts on longer descents and climbs going parallel with the trail. There was one descent like that where there was a single line. The rest of the drop is just crap and it's going to freak less experienced riders out." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/sea-otter-classic-2023-fuego-la-gravilla-et-al/82332)

**Rachel Hwang [COMPETITIVE]:** "I also crashed early on the first lap from a rut where multiple people crashed." (https://www.altovelo.org/blog/race-report-2024-sea-otter-classic-fuego-xl)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Hannah Otto [COMPETITIVE]:** "The Sea Otter Classic is a cornerstone in the cycling world. It holds a special place in my heart as well. I've been coming to Sea Otter since I was 12 years old, racing as many races as I could fit into the four-day period. I would practically run from booth to booth. I would collect as many autographs as I could and watch all of the pro athletes perform. Now, I am one of the pro athletes." (https://firstendurance.com/blogs/articles/2023-sea-otter-classic-fuego-xl-race-report)

**Hannah Otto [COMPETITIVE]:** "Sea Otter gives me energy. While many athletes feel a little over-worked at this event, all of those obligations fire me up and motivate me to perform." (https://firstendurance.com/blogs/articles/2023-sea-otter-classic-fuego-xl-race-report)

**Michael Van Den Ham [ELITE]:** "I headed to Sea Otter this year not with racing as my main focus, but to connect with the partners, sponsors, and friends who make my season possible... This trip reminded me how valuable the people behind the scenes are. The ones who support, encourage, and believe in what I'm doing both on and off the bike. That podium? Just a bonus on top of a weekend full of good conversations, shared love for all things bikes, and community." (https://www.wolftoothcomponents.com/blogs/news/michael-van-den-ham-fuego-xl-race-recap)

**Keegan Swenson [ELITE]:** "This is one of my favorite events of the year and I've been racing here since I was 17 years old. I have a lot of good memories and it's always fun to come back and race in Monterey." (https://www.cxmagazine.com/keegan-swenson-sofia-gomez-2024-sea-otter-fuego-xl-results-report)

**Rachel Hwang [COMPETITIVE]:** On finding a riding companion during a difficult second lap: "I paced with her the rest of the way to the end. While we didn't say a single word to one another on the trail, we exchanged a few words at the end and agreed it's definitely more fun and enjoyable with a fellow rider." (https://www.altovelo.org/blog/race-report-2024-sea-otter-classic-fuego-xl)

**Post-Race Amenities [Official]:** "Post-race lunch and complimentary Sierra Nevada beer at the Casa Amigos Rider Lounge. Your lunch must be redeemed on the same day of your race/ride." Also includes "Complimentary post-ride showers, Limited bag drop, Secure bike valet." (https://www.seaotterclassic.com/cross-country/)

**Awards:** "Medals awarded to the top three finishers in each category." Also: "Let's make it official with your custom winner's jersey, returning in 2026 for winners in each category." (https://www.seaotterclassic.com/cross-country/)

**Hannah Otto [COMPETITIVE]:** On dealing with her flat and the support from strangers: "A man stopped and offered his CO2. It was lifesaver. I gathered a few CO2s as we put a tube in my tire... A massive thank you to all of my supporters, fans, friends, family, and sponsors. When I was standing on the side of the trail, I looked up at the sky, I wondered what I would do, I said a prayer, and I remembered that you were all refreshing your live results, wondering what was happening, and your spirits kept mine up."
