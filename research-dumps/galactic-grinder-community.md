# GALACTIC GRINDER — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Event Overview & Context

The Galactic Grinder is a gravel cycling event held annually near Aztec, New Mexico, organized by Aztec Adventures. The event attracts approximately 100 cyclists from the Four Corners region and offers three distance options: 9-12 miles, 35-37 miles, and 50-55 miles (distances vary slightly by year).

**Location:** Cedar Hill/Aztec, New Mexico
**Founded:** 2021 by Neil Hannum (founder of Aztec Adventures) in collaboration with Fort Lewis College graduate William Farmer, cousin Haden Cox, and volunteers
**Event Philosophy:** "Go Fast, Go Slow, Just Go" — explicitly welcoming riders of all abilities
**Unique Feature:** The course finishes with the Alien Run trail system, which is the namesake inspiration for the event's space/alien theme. Riders are encouraged to dress in intergalactic/alien costumes.

The event is part of a three-race series by Aztec Adventures, along with Gas Field Grinder (June) and Holy Grit. Riders registering for all three events receive a 20% discount.

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Course Composition:**
- Almost entirely dirt/gravel with minimal pavement
- Includes 3.8-4 miles of the Alien Run singletrack trail system
- 50-mile course features 4,500+ feet of elevation gain
- Described as having "steep punchy climbs up to 12%" (https://farmingtonnm.org/events/galactic-gravel-grinder)

**Surface Conditions:**
The terrain is described in official reports as having varied and challenging surfaces:
- "Some sections of the lunar landscape were sandy and challenging at times while other sections on roads were 'glazed' by traffic and then baked under the New Mexico sunshine. This made for a fast pace in those areas of the galaxy." (https://triathloninsight.com/insight-update/third-annual-galactic-grinder-challenges-cyclists-2/)
- Course features "mesas, washes, and singletrack" (multiple sources)
- Roads described as "burly" and "rougher than other gravel event roads" (https://farmingtonnm.org/events/galactic-gravel-grinder)

**Navigation:**
- MANDATORY navigation device with loaded route required for 37 and 53-mile distances
- Course marking provided but considered insufficient alone: "There are a bunch of tricky turns out there and we don't want anyone getting lost. The course will be marked the best we can but if we use the combination, we should avoid lost riders." (https://farmingtonnm.org/events/galactic-gravel-grinder)

**Aid Stations:**
- 37-mile course: Aid stations at miles 23 and 31
- 53-mile course: Aid stations at miles 23 and 46

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Bike Choice [ALL LEVELS]:**
Official event guidance states: "Make sure your gravel bike is up for the burly roads NM has to offer! If you don't have a gravel bike a mountain bike is perfectly acceptable." (https://farmingtonnm.org/events/galactic-gravel-grinder and https://aztec-adventures.com/galactic-grinder/)

The explicit mention that mountain bikes are "perfectly acceptable" suggests the terrain is rough enough that gravel bikes may be at the limit of appropriate equipment, particularly given the 3.8 miles of singletrack and sandy sections.

**Navigation Equipment [REQUIRED for 37 & 53-mile]:**
GPS device with pre-loaded route is mandatory for longer distances due to complex routing on remote gas field roads.

## Race Strategy & Pacing

No specific pacing or nutrition strategies were documented in the available sources.

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Regional Context:**
Multiple sources emphasize that the event is part of establishing San Juan County, New Mexico as a cycling destination: "Often overshadowed by the famed trails and cycling community in Durango, Colo., San Juan County is a hidden paradise of mountain biking and gravel riding just waiting to be discovered." (https://triathloninsight.com/insight-update/third-annual-galactic-grinder-challenges-cyclists-2/)

The region is described as "looking toward outdoor recreation as a future economic diversifier" with Aztec Adventures "blazing trails for cyclists to enjoy for generations to come." (https://outdoorindustry.org/press-release/third-annual-galactic-grinder-challenges-cyclists-northeast-of-aztec-n-m/)

**Event Character:**
- Space/alien theme with encouragement to dress in costume: "DRESS UP!!!!" (https://aztec-adventures.com/galactic-grinder/)
- The course narrative uses space terminology: riders complete "orbits" through the "galaxy" and experience the "lunar landscape"
- New 2024 location in Cedar Hill "allowed everyone to spread out and warm up with some of the local trail lines on the property" (https://triathloninsight.com/insight-update/third-annual-galactic-grinder-challenges-cyclists-2/)

**Inclusivity:**
The event explicitly welcomes all ability levels through its "Go Fast, Go Slow, Just Go" philosophy, with categories spanning from Under-12 youth to Open Adult across all three distances.
