# GARMIN GRAVEL WORLDS — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Mathew Wollmann [UNKNOWN]:** "I chose at the beginning of 2024 to only focus on one race. I am/was/still am in the middle of a career change from Law Enforcement to Aviation, and I needed to focus on that. With that being said I still felt that I was prepped and could no doubt accomplish the event without absolutely murdering myself." (https://www.mathewwollmann.com/post/garmin-gravel-worlds-300-2024-race-recap)

**Mathew Wollmann [UNKNOWN]:** "Usually, the night before I'm in bed by 10 PM getting a full night's rest. This event is challenging. It doesn't start until 5 PM Friday. To truly be well rested ideally you sleep in until past noon. This is not my style. I'm usually up bright and early and continue to pace around thinking about the race all day. I tried a different tactic this year... A couple of glasses of wine later and a belly full of pasta... I hit the bed around midnight and indeed, slept in past or near noon. No regrets. I felt amazing and carefree for the first time on race day. Maybe I've unlocked a new race tactic? Probably not." (https://www.mathewwollmann.com/post/garmin-gravel-worlds-300-2024-race-recap)

**Mathew Wollmann [UNKNOWN]:** "That night I was all over the road. Literally yelling out loud to wake up. Digestively I was great. I always felt full and had no cramps. Things were going very smoothly." (https://www.mathewwollmann.com/post/garmin-gravel-worlds-300-2024-race-recap)

**Mathew Wollmann [UNKNOWN]:** "In ultra, 2.5 miles feels like lightyears away. You could be watching a blinky light from the person in front of you for a couple hours at night with no progress." (https://www.mathewwollmann.com/post/garmin-gravel-worlds-300-2024-race-recap)

**Mathew Wollmann [UNKNOWN]:** "As the sun rose I knew that the hard part was behind me. Even with no sleep, a sunrise will bring you to life. It's an amazing feeling to be recharged by its energy." (https://www.mathewwollmann.com/post/garmin-gravel-worlds-300-2024-race-recap)

**Mathew Wollmann [UNKNOWN]:** "At mile 287 I began to feel my first cramps... I began to stop sweating, developed a headache, and the cramps got worse. Uh oh, I've been here before. Thankfully I knew to just back it off a bit, and I found my way to my 3rd Gravel Worlds 300 finish line... As I was welcomed by the Hotvet's and Emily, I knew I was in trouble. I looked over at the med tent, and they looked at me. I just walked over and said I need an IV. Sooooo I got myself a free IV!" (https://www.mathewwollmann.com/post/garmin-gravel-worlds-300-2024-race-recap)

**Mathew Wollmann [UNKNOWN]:** "Goals going into it: Sub 24 hrs, stoked if sub 20 ✅ 21 hrs 53 min | Top 20 ✅ Finished 19th overall, 17th overall mens | Sub 1 hr off bike time - 106 min 👎SO CLOSE! But in 2023 my OBT was almost 3 hrs. So a massive improvement." (https://www.mathewwollmann.com/post/garmin-gravel-worlds-300-2024-race-recap)

**hubcyclist [UNKNOWN]:** "i did the 150 in 2019, finished in 10hrs, although I think I was on pace to do 8.5-9. I picked a bad time to try a new thing, a full camelback 3l, which I attribute to lower back pain I got about halfway through and really messed up my ability to keep on the power." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/the-nebraska-garmin-gravel-worlds-2024-tell-me-about-it/95329)

**hubcyclist [UNKNOWN]:** "It's very up and down and not flat, despite the perception of nebraska being pancake flat. aside from a long day with some discomfort, it was a good time, although at the current reg price I wouldn't do it again, it was half as much when I did it." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/the-nebraska-garmin-gravel-worlds-2024-tell-me-about-it/95329)

**koalb [UNKNOWN]:** "You'll hear the promoters talk about riding 'the gravel seas', and that's exactly it. You're going to be up and down over the whole course. None of the climbs are that big, but there are a ton of them. Manage your speed on the downhills and you will be fine." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/the-nebraska-garmin-gravel-worlds-2024-tell-me-about-it/95329)

**Dbecker27 [UNKNOWN]:** "The gravel is not chunky at all and smooth. Do be careful of the oncoming traffic on the gravel roads and also when descending there can be sections of soft gravel which can through you off line." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/the-nebraska-garmin-gravel-worlds-2024-tell-me-about-it/95329)

**KCBikeNerd [UNKNOWN]:** "I hurt lol. Omg it was so hot. Heat index was 105+. Flat at mile 30 that was a pain to fix. Then mile 60-120 was into a headwind. Stung on the head by something at mile 80ish. Still a welt there. Heat got me hard so I chilled for a while at a stop at mile 100 and 120 to cool down and catch up on hydration, electrolytes, and calories. I'm guessing a lot of DNFs. 10:52 moving time. 13:20 total ish so that was a bummer but I'm still damn happy to finish with how hard it was." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/the-nebraska-garmin-gravel-worlds-2024-tell-me-about-it/95329)

**KCBikeNerd [UNKNOWN]:** "Race organizer is awesome, the volunteers were great, the route was brutal. Never flat with loose pea gravel. I'd do it again though, but man I wish I was stronger. Next time more chamois cream. Small sunblock to reapply since I didn't get to til mile 100. Only a tad burned on one arm so eh success." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/the-nebraska-garmin-gravel-worlds-2024-tell-me-about-it/95329)

**KCBikeNerd [UNKNOWN]:** "~150 started the 150 and only 97 finished. I was around 87, which, whatever, just glad to finish at that point. Feel like I have the legs to do far better next time if the heat isnt as bad. Then again those that sign up for 150 on gravel are definitely a more selective bunch, gravel has some very very very strong riders." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/the-nebraska-garmin-gravel-worlds-2024-tell-me-about-it/95329)

**KCBikeNerd [UNKNOWN]:** "It was real rough mile 60-120 right into a furnace headwind. It pretty much slaughtered the mid/tail end of the 'party pace' folks just wanting to complete it." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/the-nebraska-garmin-gravel-worlds-2024-tell-me-about-it/95329)

**Zach Nehr [COMPETITIVE]:** "Racing against the pros is far more than just pushing the right power. Here's how Matt Beers won in Nebraska, and how I fared at Lauf Gravel Worlds." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/power-analysis-lauf-gravel-worlds-2025-in-a-100000-face-off/)

**Jason Strohbehn [ELITE]:** "From 'first to last,' we're elevating the experience of every participant" (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/garmin-gravel-worlds/)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Mathew Wollmann [UNKNOWN] - 300-Mile Setup:** "I went with my tried and true setup for this race... I had a super light setup with two aspero bags. A top tube bag with essentials such as plugs, CO2, lights, battery, etc. Things I would need quickly. My saddle bag contained a light rain jacket, two extra embark maple pouches, and my shaded oakleys. I started the race with clear lenses on so I didn't have to stop and transition between the two. I had done this the year prior and found it to be very beneficial." (https://www.mathewwollmann.com/post/garmin-gravel-worlds-300-2024-race-recap)

**Mathew Wollmann [UNKNOWN] - Aerobars for 300:** "I had my Red Shift aero bars mounted up and everything felt fantastic." (https://www.mathewwollmann.com/post/garmin-gravel-worlds-300-2024-race-recap)

**Mathew Wollmann [UNKNOWN] - Saddle:** "I had also switched out my normal saddle for my Sworks Power saddle. This turned to be a great decision." (https://www.mathewwollmann.com/post/garmin-gravel-worlds-300-2024-race-recap)

**Mathew Wollmann [UNKNOWN] - Hydration System:** "I run two bottles on the bike frame with Embark maple mix, and a USWE Rush 8L Bike Hydration Vest with Nuun electrolyte tablets." (https://www.mathewwollmann.com/post/garmin-gravel-worlds-300-2024-race-recap)

**hubcyclist [UNKNOWN] - Caution on Camelbacks:** "I picked a bad time to try a new thing, a full camelback 3l, which I attribute to lower back pain I got about halfway through and really messed up my ability to keep on the power." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/the-nebraska-garmin-gravel-worlds-2024-tell-me-about-it/95329)

**Aerobars Discussion [MIXED LEVELS]:** 
- **KCBikeNerd [UNKNOWN]:** "I figure ill run my aerobars on the gravel bike, and I plan to put the stiffest elastomers in my new redshift stem. If anything just for the extra body position."
- **Trash_Panda [UNKNOWN]:** "I'd slap the aeros on. 150m is a long day just for the extra position. Probably be alone for a big part of it. If windy probably wish you had them."
- **koalb [UNKNOWN]:** "If you like them, I'd say use 'em. Don't think the race has any restrictions."
- **Dbecker27 [UNKNOWN]:** "i rode with my aero bars but i did the 300 miler so it was more spread out. Others can chime in but i would think you could probably skip putting them on [for the 150]."

**KCBikeNerd [UNKNOWN] - Lessons Learned:** "Next time more chamois cream. Small sunblock to reapply since I didn't get to til mile 100." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/the-nebraska-garmin-gravel-worlds-2024-tell-me-about-it/95329)

## Weather Experienced

**2024 - 300 Mile (August 24):** "Race weather proved to be gorgeous with a tailwind most of the night. A chance of rain depending where you were on the course closer to morning, but I wasn't worried." - Mathew Wollmann [UNKNOWN] (https://www.mathewwollmann.com/post/garmin-gravel-worlds-300-2024-race-recap)

**2024 - 150 Mile Day (August 24):** "It was starting to heat up and temps were projected to rise above 100 with heat indexes up to 105... At this point, I was almost out of drinkable water and was out of water to spray on me. I began to stop sweating, developed a headache, and the cramps got worse." - Mathew Wollmann [UNKNOWN] (https://www.mathewwollmann.com/post/garmin-gravel-worlds-300-2024-race-recap)

**2024 - 150 Mile Heat Impact:** "Omg it was so hot. Heat index was 105+... Then mile 60-120 was into a headwind... Heat got me hard so I chilled for a while at a stop at mile 100 and 120 to cool down and catch up on hydration, electrolytes, and calories." - KCBikeNerd [UNKNOWN] (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/the-nebraska-garmin-gravel-worlds-2024-tell-me-about-it/95329)

**2024 - 150 Mile Wind Pattern:** "The headwind picked up but it was honestly refreshing with the heat." - Mathew Wollmann [UNKNOWN] at mile 250+ (https://www.mathewwollmann.com/post/garmin-gravel-worlds-300-2024-race-recap)

**2024 - Pre-Race Weather Impact:** "Crazy because I think like 250-300 signed up originally but then most dropped to the 75 the week before due to the forecast." - KCBikeNerd [UNKNOWN] (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/the-nebraska-garmin-gravel-worlds-2024-tell-me-about-it/95329)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**The "Gravel Seas" Description:** "You'll hear the promoters talk about riding 'the gravel seas', and that's exactly it. You're going to be up and down over the whole course. None of the climbs are that big, but there are a ton of them." - koalb [UNKNOWN] (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/the-nebraska-garmin-gravel-worlds-2024-tell-me-about-it/95329)

**Not Flat:** "It's very up and down and not flat, despite the perception of nebraska being pancake flat." - hubcyclist [UNKNOWN] (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/the-nebraska-garmin-gravel-worlds-2024-tell-me-about-it/95329)

**Surface Quality:** "The gravel is not chunky at all and smooth." - Dbecker27 [UNKNOWN] (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/the-nebraska-garmin-gravel-worlds-2024-tell-me-about-it/95329)

**Rolling Hills Character:** "The gravel roads were halfway decent, with only a few with big chunky rocks. We were beginning to get into the roller portions of the course, which were mentally draining." - Mathew Wollmann [UNKNOWN] at mile 250+ (https://www.mathewwollmann.com/post/garmin-gravel-worlds-300-2024-race-recap)

**Surface Description - 2024:** "Never flat with loose pea gravel." - KCBikeNerd [UNKNOWN] (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/the-nebraska-garmin-gravel-worlds-2024-tell-me-about-it/95329)

**Roller Hills:** "It looks like a lot of elevation change but short and not so steep hills. Its the punchy 12-20% guys that kill me, so maybe this will go well for me." - KCBikeNerd [UNKNOWN] pre-race assessment (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/the-nebraska-garmin-gravel-worlds-2024-tell-me-about-it/95329)

**Train Crossing:** "A train was blocking the road. I picked up my bike and hiked around it over the tracks. I had places to be." - Mathew Wollmann [UNKNOWN] at mile 250 (https://www.mathewwollmann.com/post/garmin-gravel-worlds-300-2024-race-recap)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Mathew Wollmann [UNKNOWN] - 300 Mile Front Group Strategy:** "I hung with the front group until about mile 12. From years past I knew better than to try and hang with them. Another 5 of us stuck together until about mile 40. After that, it was pretty much solo work with a passer-by to chat with the entire night." (https://www.mathewwollmann.com/post/garmin-gravel-worlds-300-2024-race-recap)

**Mathew Wollmann [UNKNOWN] - Stop Strategy for 300:** "My goal of staying on the bike, and making my gas station stops fast AF was paying off. I stopped at miles 57, 131, and took only a bit longer at 189 because I needed an 8-minute snoozer and needed to wait for the store to open. Just before sunrise." Off-bike time: 106 minutes total. (https://www.mathewwollmann.com/post/garmin-gravel-worlds-300-2024-race-recap)

**Night Riding Reality:** "That night I was all over the road. Literally yelling out loud to wake up." - Mathew Wollmann [UNKNOWN] (https://www.mathewwollmann.com/post/garmin-gravel-worlds-300-2024-race-recap)

**Heat Management Strategy:** "Topped off on water, I strictly used my bottles now to spray over my body to keep cool. It was HOT... I stopped and refueled, dumping a 1/2 gallon of water over me. It was starting to heat up... To the side, were bags of ice just melting. I asked if I could have some of that ice. I then filled my jersey, helmet, and neck with as much ice as I could fit and took off." - Mathew Wollmann [UNKNOWN] (https://www.mathewwollmann.com/post/garmin-gravel-worlds-300-2024-race-recap)

**Decision Point - When to Skip Stops:** "At mile 287 I began to feel my first cramps. Anthony decided to stop at Casey's. I knew that if I stopped I don't think I would get any better, and would run the risk of losing a few spots. I pressed on." - Mathew Wollmann [UNKNOWN] (https://www.mathewwollmann.com/post/garmin-gravel-worlds-300-2024-race-recap)

**Recovery Strategy When Overheating:** "I knew to just back it off a bit" - Mathew Wollmann [UNKNOWN] when experiencing heat exhaustion symptoms (https://www.mathewwollmann.com/post/garmin-gravel-worlds-300-2024-race-recap)

## DNF Risk Factors

**2024 Heat-Related DNFs:** "~150 started the 150 and only 97 finished" (64.7% finish rate). "There were a lot of DNFs this year in the 150 mile event due to the heat - upwards of 1/3." - koalb [UNKNOWN] (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/the-nebraska-garmin-gravel-worlds-2024-tell-me-about-it/95329)

**Heat Impact on Mid-Pack:** "It was real rough mile 60-120 right into a furnace headwind. It pretty much slaughtered the mid/tail end of the 'party pace' folks just wanting to complete it." - KCBikeNerd [UNKNOWN] (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/the-nebraska-garmin-gravel-worlds-2024-tell-me-about-it/95329)

**Heat Exhaustion Symptoms:** "I began to stop sweating, developed a headache, and the cramps got worse. Uh oh, I've been here before." - Mathew Wollmann [UNKNOWN] at mile 287 (https://www.mathewwollmann.com/post/garmin-gravel-worlds-300-2024-race-recap)

**Medical Intervention:** "As I was welcomed by the Hotvet's and Emily, I knew I was in trouble. I looked over at the med tent, and they looked at me. I just walked over and said I need an IV. Sooooo I got myself a free IV!" - Mathew Wollmann [UNKNOWN] (https://www.mathewwollmann.com/post/garmin-gravel-worlds-300-2024-race-recap)

**Equipment Failure Impact:** "Flat at mile 30 that was a pain to fix." - KCBikeNerd [UNKNOWN] (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/the-nebraska-garmin-gravel-worlds-2024-tell-me-about-it/95329)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Race Organization Quality:** "Race organizer is awesome, the volunteers were great" - KCBikeNerd [UNKNOWN] (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/the-nebraska-garmin-gravel-worlds-2024-tell-me-about-it/95329)

**Aid Station Quality:** "At mile 270 we stopped at a VERY well stocked aid station. Almost anything you could ask for. We both left there well refreshed and ready for the next 30." - Mathew Wollmann [UNKNOWN] (https://www.mathewwollmann.com/post/garmin-gravel-worlds-300-2024-race-recap)

**koalb [UNKNOWN]:** "Race promoters do a great job. You'll be well supported. Plenty of goo, cokes and other snacks at the aid stations. You'll likely be offered a couple free hot dogs or brats along the way." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/the-nebraska-garmin-gravel-worlds-2024-tell-me-about-it/95329)

**Rider Interactions:** "Seeing another rider after a long night is comical. You both just look at each other knowing what you both went through, but only say, 'You good?' 'Yea, I'm good.'" - Mathew Wollmann [UNKNOWN] (https://www.mathewwollmann.com/post/garmin-gravel-worlds-300-2024-race-recap)

**Local Encounters:** "I always love when people ask, 'Going for a bike ride today!? Little hot out!' I reply with yea great day to ride. 'How far ya going?' Well, I've got 50 miles left. 'Left? How far have you gone?' 250.... The look they give you is priceless." - Mathew Wollmann [UNKNOWN] (https://www.mathewwollmann.com/post/garmin-gravel-worlds-300-2024-race-recap)

**Lincoln Pre-Race Scene:** "We stayed at the Graduate by Hilton Hotels in Lincoln. It's a downtown location which provided a fun time for Emily while I raced for 20+ hours. A beautiful view of Memorial Stadium as well. It also provided a fun Thursday night for us! We started by eating at Napoli's Haymarket... A few drinks there and some amazing arcade games, we then hit up the Starlite Lounge next door. A VERY cool 1940's 1940s-style lounge, also, with amazing drinks." - Mathew Wollmann [UNKNOWN] (https://www.mathewwollmann.com/post/garmin-gravel-worlds-300-2024-race-recap)

**Lincoln as Destination:** "Depending on how adventurous you are feeling, Lincoln is a fun little college town." - koalb [UNKNOWN] (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/the-nebraska-garmin-gravel-worlds-2024-tell-me-about-it/95329)

**Venue Change (2024):** "The venue and race start was changed to the fairgrounds which I think was a great move on behalf of the organizers. A massive structure to house all of the vendors. And plenty of parking." - Mathew Wollmann [UNKNOWN] (https://www.mathewwollmann.com/post/garmin-gravel-worlds-300-2024-race-recap)

**Notable Participants:** "A lot of familiar faces and names in the ultra community. The Vegan Cyclist also made an appearance which was fun to see." - Mathew Wollmann [UNKNOWN] (https://www.mathewwollmann.com/post/garmin-gravel-worlds-300-2024-race-recap)

**Support from Home:** "I love having my Garmin 1030 synced with my phone. The outpouring of support from everyone is amazing to see come across my screen. Thank you! My wife is the most of those texts. 'You are in 14th Place right now. Tyler is in 7th' 'Another day, another slay!!!' 'You are now about 2.5 miles behind the next guy'" - Mathew Wollmann [UNKNOWN] (https://www.mathewwollmann.com/post/garmin-gravel-worlds-300-2024-race-recap)

**Pro Women Racing:** "We had the pro women fly by us for the 150 course which is always fun to watch. FAST!" - Mathew Wollmann [UNKNOWN] at mile 270 (https://www.mathewwollmann.com/post/garmin-gravel-worlds-300-2024-race-recap)

**"First to Last" Initiative:** In 2024, Garmin Gravel Worlds announced a new "First to Last" initiative celebrating every participant's journey, with a party for the final finisher sponsored by All Bodies on Bikes and Ride With GPS. Extended cutoff time from 9:00 PM to 9:59 PM for the 150-mile event. (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/garmin-gravel-worlds/)

**Pro Field Addition (2024):** New pro fields with $30,000 prize purse split evenly between men and women (top 5 each), plus $10,000 added to women's pro purse from Goodlife Brands. First 20 pro women to reach checkpoint 2 ahead of general field received $500 regardless of finish position. (https://www.gravelworlds.com/blog/garmin-gravel-worlds-adds-live-event-coverage-bolsters-womens-pro-prize-purse)

**Live Coverage (2024):** First year with free livestream coverage, including lead/follow motorcycles for pro fields and a fifth camera for deeper pack riders, with live commentary from start to finish. (https://www.gravelworlds.com/blog/garmin-gravel-worlds-adds-live-event-coverage-bolsters-womens-pro-prize-purse)

**Charitable Component:** Each pro cyclist donated $200 to a charity of their choice, with charity name on their number plate. Event committed $30,000 total to causes aligned with gravel cycling community values. (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/garmin-gravel-worlds/)

**Historical Context:** Founded by Corey "Cornbread" Godfrey and Craig "Schmidty" Schmidt through the Pirate Cycling League in 2009/2010. Originally conceived as a tongue-in-cheek response to professional road racing - a "world championship" for gravel when no one thought there should be one. Event started with no entry fee, postcard registration, and required lottery ticket purchases at checkpoints as proof of passage. By 2024, entry fee reached $175 (from $0 in 2013, $80 in 2018). The original founders left the event in 2024. (https://g-tedproductions.blogspot.com/2024/04/gravel-grinder-news-changes-at-gravel.html)

**Attendance Trends:** Registration peaked in 2022 at ~1600 finishers, dropped to ~1000 finishers in 2024. Finish rate in 2024 was better than recent years despite lower registration. The 1,000 Women initiative from 2022 had significant impact, with particularly sharp decline in women's registration post-2022.
