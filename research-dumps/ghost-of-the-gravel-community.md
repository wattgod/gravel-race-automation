# GHOST OF THE GRAVEL — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Benjamin Perry [ELITE]:** "I've won junior and U23 titles, but I'd never gotten the elite one. I've been dreaming of this for so long. I'm so proud to be Canadian. I can't wait to bring the custom jersey to Europe and show the world what it means." (https://cyclingmagazine.ca/gravel/ghost-of-the-gravel-crowns-canadian-champions-in-albertas-backcountry/)

**Bruce Bird [ELITE]:** "Getting this jersey, what an honour. It's really what I hoped for." (https://cyclingmagazine.ca/gravel/ghost-of-the-gravel-crowns-canadian-champions-in-albertas-backcountry/)

**FatBoySlim [COMPETITIVE]:** "Around 77 Km I really started to cramp in my quads. I popped electrolyte tablets in my mouth and started sucking on them to save my life. I also added them to my other bottle and drank as much as possible and refilled at the last feed station. I managed to keep the cramps mostly away by varying my positions on the climbs and by stretching them out while riding and manipulating them with my thumbs."

**FatBoySlim [COMPETITIVE]:** "In the final climb that lasted around 3 km my heart rate hit over 205 on three different occasions and that seems high for a 50 year old. My average heart rate for the day was 152. Cadence was 79 and that seemed low until I remembered the amount of climbing that was done. I also burned almost 3200 calories." Finished in 4:33:43, improving from 5:09 the previous year to finish 65th place overall. (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/tr-success-story-ghost-of-the-gravel-alberta-my-2019-a-race/17262)

**Hugh McDougall [COMPETITIVE - Junior]:** "It was full gas from the start. Everyone was attacking early, and it just didn't let up. I'm proud to have held strong and represented Fernie on the national stage." Finished 4th in Junior Men's with a time of 3:58:13. (https://fernie.com/blog/hugh-mcdougall-rides-to-4th-at-canadian-gravel-championships/)

**trevorrr [COMPETITIVE]:** "The hard thing about this race is that the climbs get punchier in the last third, and a lot of people cramp up. There is also the two sustained ~10km downhill sections where if you wind up without a group, you will be fighting the wind on your own. Last year I had to choose between going slower than I could sustain with a few big guys, and forging on solo. I went solo, and ended up finishing 5+ min ahead of the people I was with, but had circumstances been different I could have been up the road quite a bit."

**arsenalastronaut [UNKNOWN]:** Reported that wet, mucky conditions "basically ate thru my chain (past the wear indicator at 700km) and same with brake pads" during a previous edition. Considering using "super cheap decathlon brake pads just for the event" after spending $85 CAD on SRAM sintered pads. (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/1dfw6h6/how_to_minimize_drivetrain_and_brake_damage_in/)

## Weather Experienced

**2025 edition:** The conditions were described as "classic Alberta foothills: unpredictable, rugged, and relentless" with the route described as living up to its name for "no-nonsense terrain and unpredictable weather." (https://cyclingmagazine.ca/gravel/ghost-of-the-gravel-crowns-canadian-champions-in-albertas-backcountry/)

**Expected 2024 conditions (from pre-race forecast):** "It will be like 5-9 degrees Celsius in rain" with riders expected to be out for around 6 hours. Conditions described as "very wet and mucky" the previous year. (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/1dfw6h6/how_to_minimize_drivetrain_and_brake_damage_in/)

**2019 edition:** "Today's race was a little wetter course but the temperature hit 25 degrees C. We've only had 1 or 2 days this year of that temperature so I was not really ready for it." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/tr-success-story-ghost-of-the-gravel-alberta-my-2019-a-race/17262)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Course profile:** 118km total distance with 110km of gravel and 6,800 feet (2,073m) of climbing. The course follows "meandering hills that follow the contours of the foothills through ranch land valleys across roads of packed clay gravel with a few sections of looser gravel." (https://ucigravelworldseries.com/en/ghost-of-gravel/)

**Key sections from official course description:**
- After 4km, riders hit gravel for the first time after crossing the Little Red Deer river
- Main climb to Harold Creek Road/#579 reaches 5,200' elevation at kilometer 34, with a 4km climb to the Friendly Ghost (66km) turnaround/feed station
- Descending section described as "scenic, incredibly fun, and should be approached with care around blind corners – it has also been used as a timed section in Western Canada's Rally West circuit"
- Course climbs again over 5,300' on Trunk Road 40 before reaching highest point of 5,400' at kilometer 60
- Feed #2 at 62km comes after fast descending speed
- Back section is "mostly rolling with less sustained climbing, but for one or two leg crushers" with "less loose, more packed clay" road surface
- Feed #3 at approximately 87km
- One final sharp paved hill before the finish line

**trevorrr [COMPETITIVE]:** Notes "two sustained ~10km downhill sections where if you wind up without a group, you will be fighting the wind on your own" and that "climbs get punchier in the last third."

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**FatBoySlim [COMPETITIVE] — 4:33:43 finish time:**
- Pre-race breakfast: 4 eggs, 4 pieces of bacon in coconut oil, some fried coconut
- During race: 6 SIS isotonic gels, 1 skratch bar, 3 perogies and 1 piece of bacon (at last feed stop)
- **Critical nutrition mistake:** Only took electrolytes in water bottles, not carb-loaded water. "After listening to a recent podcast I remembered that it is important to have one normal bottle of water per bottle of Carb mix. Problem is that I was not taking carb loaded water."
- Around 77km started severe quad cramping. "I popped electrolyte tablets in my mouth and started sucking on them to save my life."
- At worst, was almost 14 minutes behind target 4:30 pace but recovered to finish in 4:33:43
- Average heart rate: 152 bpm, cadence: 79 rpm
- Burned approximately 3,200 calories

**Community feedback on FatBoySlim's strategy [COMPETITIVE]:**
- trpnhntr noted: "You ate a very high fat breakfast - fuel that helps you tomorrow, not today. Even if you aren't a carb person you should try to find some pre-race carbs that you can tolerate."
- Captain_Doughnutman: "I believe there are plenty of HFLC athletes (mostly triathletes I think) who carb the f#ck up for races only. You'll be burning through the carbs, not storing them; afterwards, return to your regular way of eating."

**Hugh McDougall [COMPETITIVE - Junior]:** "It was full gas from the start. Everyone was attacking early, and it just didn't let up." (https://fernie.com/blog/hugh-mcdougall-rides-to-4th-at-canadian-gravel-championships/)

**trevorrr [COMPETITIVE]:** Strategy decision point around the sustained downhill sections: "Last year I had to choose between going slower than I could sustain with a few big guys, and forging on solo. I went solo, and ended up finishing 5+ min ahead of the people I was with, but had circumstances been different I could have been up the road quite a bit."

## DNF Risk Factors

**Cramping:** Multiple riders reported cramping issues, particularly in the last third of the race around the 77km mark and beyond. trevorrr notes "a lot of people cramp up" in the last third when climbs get punchier. (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/tr-success-story-ghost-of-the-gravel-alberta-my-2019-a-race/17262)

**Mechanical wear in wet conditions:** arsenalastronaut reported that wet, mucky conditions wore through chain (past wear indicator at 700km) and brake pads during a previous wet edition. (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/1dfw6h6/how_to_minimize_drivetrain_and_brake_damage_in/)

**Course hazards:** Official course description warns that portions of the course "do not have cell phone coverage so in the event of an emergency or inclement weather, you'll need to be self sufficient." The descent from Harold Creek Road is described as having "blind corners" requiring care. (https://ucigravelworldseries.com/en/ghost-of-gravel/ and https://deadgoat.ca/ghostofthegravel/)

**2025 course closure:** The section from Lyell Campground to Lyell Saddle hut experienced "a large and unpassable slip" (landslide), forcing route modifications. (Not from Ghost of the Gravel sources, but from Old Ghost Road NZ source - this appears to be a different trail/event)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Event origins and spirit:** "Ghost of the Gravel was born from a group of friends that loved bikes. We rode as far and frequently as possible on any bike. Winter meant gravel, and the gravel NW of Calgary was the best there was... and so the Water Valley 220 was born... One day Ghost of the Gravel was born out of a desire (need?) to make the hardest bike race we could on the coolest roads we knew - those roads just happened to be unpaved. We shortened it to only the best roads, and made sure everyone was fed and watered afterward to reward the hard day - but the spirit of pushing yourself on seldom-travelled roads remains." (https://deadgoat.ca/ghostofthegravel/)

**Event growth:** "The Ghost was first dreamt up by Calgary's Deadgoat Cycling Club as a way to push their limits on the forgotten roads northwest of the city. A decade later, it's grown into one of the country's toughest—and most beloved—gravel events." After 10 years, "we've had thousands of starters, winners from 3 different countries, and a ton of fun showing people the roads and character of Western Alberta." (https://cyclingmagazine.ca/gravel/ghost-of-the-gravel-crowns-canadian-champions-in-albertas-backcountry/ and https://deadgoat.ca/ghostofthegravel/)

**Post-race:** "Grab an ice-cold beverage and get ready for some sweet Buschel BBQ action. You've Earned it!" Full-service BBQ party at the finish. (https://ucigravelworldseries.com/en/ghost-of-gravel/)

**Historic setting:** "The historic western town of Water Valley provides the character to the start and finish of this year's event. The town is also building a new community hall, our event donates to this project, and it is our start/finish line." Water Valley is described as "a hop, skip, and a jump from Calgary (translation: about a one-hour drive)." (https://deadgoat.ca/ghostofthegravel/)

**2026 elevation:** The race becomes "the Canadian stop of the Panaracer GravelKing UCI Gravel World Series" starting in 2026, described as "World-class gravel. Canadian grit." (https://deadgoat.ca/ghostofthegravel/)
