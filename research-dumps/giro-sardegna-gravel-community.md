The prerequisites for this event include the breathtaking beauty of specific locations at a particular time of the year, such as the vibrant colors and scents of spring in Sardinia."

"This stage race follows the model of iconic cycling events like the Giro d'Italia or Tour de France, with a notable difference – at the end of the week, every participant feels victorious."

**Participant Demographics:**

## Course Changes & Safety Notes

**2024 vs 2025/2026 Location Change:**
- 2024: Race started in Orosei at ITI Marina Resort, 13km journey to 41km local loop
- 2025-2026: Relocated to Muravera-Villasimius area (southeastern Sardinia), starting at Hotel Villaggio Colostrai

## Race Dynamics [ELITE]

**Sprint Finishes:**
Both 2024 and 2025 men's and women's elite races came down to 2-up sprints:
- 2025 men's: Decided by sprint after 3.5 hours
- 2025 women's: Won by 0.25 seconds after 4:16:18 of "head-to-head racing"
- 2024 men's: Won by 6 seconds

This suggests the course characteristics (flat coastal sections, "very fast" terrain, technically simple) favor tactical racing and group dynamics over pure attrition.
