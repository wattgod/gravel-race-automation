## Women's Gravel Scene

**Superbloom Women's Event:** A women-specific gravel event called "Glenwood Superbloom Women's Gravel Event" is scheduled for September 6, 2025, at the same location. It's described as "Celebrated as a thrilling and empowering experience, this event honours the spirit of women in cycling." (https://www.welovecycling.com/uk/2025/02/13/gravel-queens-why-women-are-owning-the-gravel-scene-in-2025/)

**Course Philosophy:** When creating Superbloom, organizers were told "this race would be too difficult for a women's race, and that we should make it easier. We thought that was nonsense, and frankly that galvanized us more because we KNEW that wasn't true. All of the smiling faces crossing the finish line was all the proof we needed, so we're sticking to the same beautiful and challenging roads."
