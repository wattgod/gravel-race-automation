# GRAN FONDO HINCAPIE — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**CaptainThunderpants [ELITE]:** "Did the ride yesterday. It was amazing. 87 miles with just over 9,000 feet of climbing. Some of the prettiest roads I've ever ridden. 100% would recommend to anybody and will be going back in the future. Even got to ride in George's group for a bit with some other ex pros and current US pro crit guys. Chatted with Ryder Hesjedal; really nice guy. It was a blast. Top 3 experiences on the bike." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/hincapie-gran-fondo/105740)

**Adoliner [ELITE]:** "I did it a few years ago and really enjoyed it. Very well run- everything from sign in to kit drop on the ride to ride stops. The Greenville ride is still one of the hardest I've ever done. Aside from the large climbs, everything in between seemed to be rolling hills and lots of turns contributing to both mental and physical fatigue. Great ride and type 2 fun." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/hincapie-gran-fondo/105740)

**fljones3 [ELITE]:** "I have attempted the gran 3-4x. I only completed it once (couple of years ago). Once I was burned out and it was raining. Did not have the mental energy to push through. Once, my power meter was off and my coach had me go out to hard. I failed the cut off time. It is the hardest that I have done but enjoyable. The switchbacks coming down the first climb are technical. Coming home after the three climbs is fast. The event is very well managed." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/hincapie-gran-fondo/105740)

**TooManyDogs [ELITE]:** "It's a well run event. The food afterwards is good. Riding in that area is nice. I've done a fair amount of riding up there. When I did the event I believe I did a 60+ mile route. Giving the amount of climbing that was plenty and still had plenty of time to relax at the after party." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/hincapie-gran-fondo/105740)

**SeanInDC [ELITE]:** "I did the 2024 Greenville edition, which was shortened to be several 20-mile laps (due to the hurricane damage). It was a bit sketchy due to the sheer number of folks lapping a short course, with vastly different speeds and group-ride experience. On a traditional course, that tends to sort out quite quickly. Well-organized experience. I might go again if I lived in the area." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/hincapie-gran-fondo/105740)

**jmkizer [ELITE]:** "I did the medio. This is the third time that I've done the ride and honestly, I plan to do the Asheville Gran Fondo and/or Six Gap next year instead as do most of the members to my bike club that do mountain rides. They charge a premium price and it should be a premium experience. That includes actually pre-riding the advertised route... They would have know that sending hundreds of riders for a timed segment on 276 was not a realistic possibility. Instead, they blamed they waited until after online registration had closed, change the route to something less desirable for the medio riders, and blamed 'the permit.'" (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/hincapie-gran-fondo/105740)

**p4lm3r [UNKNOWN]:** "This is going to be the hardest fucking ride of my life... I am going to be in a group of strangers, hoping to hold onto the peloton in my corral with zero support... On a ride that will suck physically and mentally." (https://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/comments/z4774/my_brother_backed_out_on_the_gran_fondo_hincapie/)

**Rich Hincapie (organizer) [UNKNOWN]:** "Even with the muddy conditions, the weekend event was an incredible celebration of community, endurance, and the sheer joy of cycling. It was inspiring to see riders of all levels come together, tackle the challenging terrain, and embrace the spirit of adventure." (https://granfondodailynews.com/2025/03/21/hincapie-series-kicks-off-with-a-big-muddy-mess-in-merced-results/)

**George Hincapie [ELITE]:** "We're deeply moved by the generosity of our riders and supporters over the past few years. It's a testament to our community's resilience and to what can be achieved when people come together to help neighbors in need." Regarding 2025 weather: "It's all about the challenge!"

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Tire recommendations for Merced (gravel event) [UNKNOWN LEVEL]:** "We recommend 38c or larger tires with at least a semi-slick tread for our Gran Fondo Hincapie-Merced courses." Official course notes state: "This course has been designed to be ridden on a gravel or cyclocross bike. Riders can participate on a mountain bike and will enjoy the rider range of gearing for climbs and increased comfort on descents. We do not recommend the use of a road bike on this course." (https://hincapie.com/pages/gran-fondo-merced)

**Gearing for Greenville [UNKNOWN LEVEL]:** "He has a 34/26 IIRC, so it isn't exactly a bike built for climbing, but I just told him to get a new ring on his cassette for climbing." (https://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/comments/z4774/my_brother_backed_out_on_the_gran_fondo_hincapie/)

**Road bike on Lehigh Valley chemin sections [UNKNOWN LEVEL]:** User brianly asked about riding 4 miles of dirt road sections on a 2008 Fuji Team Pro with 23mm tires, questioning if wider tires or gravel bike needed. No conclusive answer provided in thread. (https://www.reddit.com/r/cycling/comments/r3n1z7/chemin_dirt_road_sections_of_hincapie_gran_fondo/)

## Weather Experienced

**2025 Merced (March):** "Riding in the wake of an atmospheric river that slammed the Golden State with torrential rain, mud slides and flooding, hundreds of cyclists braved tough conditions (while hundreds did not) at Gran Fondo Hincapie Merced. Unfortunately conditions on the 81-mile gravel gran fondo route were deemed unsafe by local fire and emergency personnel, requiring all participants ride, and walk at times, the shorter 60-mile medio fondo route instead — which proved challenging enough." Course featured "peanut butter thick mud, deep water crossings." (https://granfondodailynews.com/2025/03/21/hincapie-series-kicks-off-with-a-big-muddy-mess-in-merced-results/)

**2025 Greenville (October):** "The weather on the day of the ride was sunny and warm with many people having to take extra hydration and salts on board to cope with the heat." (https://www.granfondoguide.com/Contents/Index/8761/2025-gran-fondo-hincapie-greenville-draws-2000-riders)

**2024 Greenville:** One rider mentioned "Once I was burned out and it was raining. Did not have the mental energy to push through." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/hincapie-gran-fondo/105740)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Greenville Gran specifics [ELITE]:** "Aside from the large climbs, everything in between seemed to be rolling hills and lots of turns contributing to both mental and physical fatigue." "The switchbacks coming down the first climb are technical. Coming home after the three climbs is fast." Official stats: 83 miles, 8,000 feet of elevation. (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/hincapie-gran-fondo/105740)

**Merced gravel course [UNKNOWN]:** Official stats show Gran: 81 miles, 4,940 ft elevation, 49% gravel/51% asphalt. Medio: 60 miles, 2,548 ft elevation, 45% gravel/55% asphalt. Course notes warn: "you may encounter ranch cattle while on course. Under no circumstances should cattle be touched, harassed, approached, or used as a selfie backdrop." Riders should "expect to finish filthy after riding through multiple water crossings, mud puddles, cow pies and plenty of gravel 'n grit." (https://hincapie.com/pages/gran-fondo-merced and https://granfondodailynews.com/2025/01/20/2025-hincapie-gran-fondo-series-starts-on-californian-gravel-in-march/)

**Merced 2025 conditions:** "You'll be done with most of the tough climbs by mile 35, but there are still a few kickers on the back half to keep things interesting." (https://hincapie.com/pages/gran-fondo-merced)

**Lehigh Valley Medio:** "55-mile course featuring 4 chemin (dirt road) sections, 8 bergs (short steep climbs), 2 covered bridges, and the rocking stadium atmosphere of the Valley Preferred Cycling Center as they finish." (https://www.reddit.com/r/cycling/comments/r3n1z7/chemin_dirt_road_sections_of_hincapie_gran_fondo/)

**Chattanooga [UNKNOWN]:** "Easier but the same well managed event" compared to Greenville. (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/hincapie-gran-fondo/105740)

## Elevation Discrepancy Warning

**Lehigh Valley Medio [UNKNOWN]:** "The official ridewithgps map contains numerous elevation blanks. It says the total elevation is 3,635 ft. The official number is close: 3,716 ft. However, Strava reports the elevation to be 4,398 ft (with gpx export/import) and it has no gaps in the elevation map. Google Maps Pro says 4,367 ft. That's around a 20% difference between highest and lowest vertical!!! So should I trust Strava or ridewithgps? 4,400 ft or 3,600 ft or unknowable? I think the 20% elevation difference may easily turn into a 10% difference in wattage needed at a given speed." User noted organizers did not respond to email and phone call.

## DNF Risk Factors

**Greenville cutoff times [ELITE]:** "Once, my power meter was off and my coach had me go out to hard. I failed the cut off time." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/hincapie-gran-fondo/105740)

**Mental fatigue [ELITE]:** "Once I was burned out and it was raining. Did not have the mental energy to push through." Multiple riders emphasized psychological difficulty: "everything in between seemed to be rolling hills and lots of turns contributing to both mental and physical fatigue." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/hincapie-gran-fondo/105740)

**Route changes [ELITE]:** 2024 Greenville was "shortened to be several 20-mile laps (due to the hurricane damage)" which created safety issues. 2025 Merced had the 81-mile gran route deemed unsafe by emergency personnel, forcing all riders onto the 60-mile medio route. (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/hincapie-gran-fondo/105740 and https://granfondodailynews.com/2025/03/21/hincapie-series-kicks-off-with-a-big-muddy-mess-in-merced-results/)

**Charity element:** The 2025 Greenville event raised over $900,000 for Polk County Community Foundation to support Hurricane Helene recovery efforts. "It's a testament to our community's resilience and to what can be achieved when people come together to help neighbors in need."

**Race format:** "A Gran Fondo is not a competition, at least not between other cyclists. You'll be timed, but mostly to prove to yourself that your hard work has paid off." Includes podium awards for overall and age group winners, plus timed "Speed Zones" on courses. (https://hincapie.com/pages/gran-fondo-hincapie)

## Course-Specific Route Criticism

**Lehigh Valley 2025 [ELITE]:** "They charge a premium price and it should be a premium experience. That includes actually pre-riding the advertised route." Rider showed photo of inappropriate road conditions on Route 276, stating organizers "waited until after online registration had closed, change the route to something less desirable for the medio riders, and blamed 'the permit.' The issue is not a piece of paper, it's the fact that it was not appropriate for hundreds of riders and they should have been on top of it." Fee noted as $245 for Medio.
