# GRAN FONDO OZARKS - RAW RESEARCH DUMP

## STATUS & AVAILABILITY NOTE

Based on the search results provided, I must be transparent: **the search results do not contain detailed information about a specific event called "Gran Fondo Ozarks."** The results reference several Ozarks-area cycling events, but none match the parameters you've specified (Eureka Springs location, 65-mile distance, 6000 ft elevation).

The search results show:

- **High In The Ozarks** - a cycling event in Ozark, AR (not Eureka Springs) that occurred on November 15, 2025[4]
- **Doom** - a March 12-13, 2026 cycling event in Jasper, AR[5]
- **Vino Fondo/Grindo Fondo** - a May 16, 2026 event (location and distance unclear from excerpts)[1]

## WHAT I CANNOT CONFIRM

Given the current search results, I cannot provide:

- Confirmation that "Gran Fondo Ozarks" is the official race name
- 2025 and 2026 race dates for this specific event
- Registration costs or field size
- Distance options or elevation breakdown
- Prize purse information
- Course terrain details
- Historical weather data
- Lodging and logistics
- Community reputation or past winners
- Rider reviews or race reports

## RECOMMENDATION

To compile the comprehensive research dump you've requested, I would need to conduct additional targeted searches specifically for:

1. "Gran Fondo Ozarks Eureka Springs" exact event name
2. The race organizer/promoter name
3. Official race website or registration platforms (BikeReg, Active, etc.)
4. Gravel cycling forums and Reddit communities discussing this specific event
5. YouTube race coverage

**Could you provide the official race name, organizer, or website URL?** This would allow me to locate the detailed information you're seeking across registration sites, race reports, and community discussions.
