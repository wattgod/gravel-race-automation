# GRASSHOPPER ADVENTURE SERIES — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Ted King [ELITE]:** "What is the Grasshopper Adventure Series? It's everything that's right about bike riding as we know it! It's fun, it's camaraderie, it's mass start, it's gravel, and it's badass." (https://www.outsideonline.com/outdoor-adventure/biking/discover-grasshopper-adventure-series/)

**Jen Tavé [ELITE]:** "The King Ridge Grasshopper was my first enduro-style event, so I was excited to try something new. I had a group of friends to do it with and we powered up the timed segments at our own paces, then regrouped. Hard steep climbs were rewarded with spectacular views of the Sonoma coast, great camaraderie amongst other competitors. Loved getting to both push myself and get to enjoy time with friends and this special cycling community." (https://www.cyclingnews.com/races/grasshopper-adventure-series-2025/king-ridge-hopper-5/results/)

**Brennan Wertz [ELITE]:** "Always a proper battle at the Hoppers and today was no different. It was a slightly different style of racing with the segment format but it was a solid fight on each segment and the guys were all firing." (https://www.cyclingnews.com/races/grasshopper-adventure-series-2025/king-ridge-hopper-5/results/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Jen Tavé's approach [ELITE]:** At King Ridge enduro-style event, "powered up the timed segments at our own paces, then regrouped" with friends between timed sections. (https://www.cyclingnews.com/races/grasshopper-adventure-series-2025/king-ridge-hopper-5/results/)

**Brennan Wertz's King Ridge performance [ELITE]:** Carried only a 4-second advantage over Taj Krieger through first two segments, then "did the damage" on the third segment with 15 miles to go, finishing with 1:17:07 total time on timed segments. (https://www.cyclingnews.com/races/grasshopper-adventure-series-2025/king-ridge-hopper-5/results/)

**General preparation advice [UNKNOWN]:** "Riders must be prepared to navigate using GPS, tackle mechanical fixes, and challenge themselves on every climb and descent." Events "encourage self-reliance" and independence. (https://www.granfondoguide.com/Series/GrasshopperAdventure)
