## SERIES OVERVIEW

### What is the Grasshopper Adventure Series?

The Grasshopper Adventure Series (commonly called "Hoppers") is the **world's first and longest-running gravel/mixed-terrain adventure series**, founded in 1998 by Miguel Crawford. The series has become an iconic fixture in the world of gravel and mixed-terrain cycling, celebrating over 25 years of operation.

**Founder:** Miguel Crawford, who grew up in Sebastopol in Northern California.

**Philosophy:** The Grasshopper is about bicycle diversity, artistry in movement, personal challenge, perseverance, and self-sufficiency. Events are designed to push riders to the limit without pushing them over, emphasizing exploration, camaraderie, and the raw beauty of Northern California's hidden landscapes.

**Historical Significance:** The Grasshopper Adventure Series was the first of its kind, sparking a movement that blended bike types and routes to challenge riders in new ways. The routes were born from Miguel Crawford's love of riding and creating the perfect combination of road and dirt. He spent endless hours flipping pages of the Northern California Gazetteer, hiking remote drainages in West Sonoma County, and exploring abandoned railroad corridors in Austin Creek.

- **Location:** Northern California (Sonoma, Mendocino, Lake, Colusa counties)

## FORUM DISCUSSIONS & COMMUNITY SENTIMENT

### MTBR.com Forum Discussions

**Participant Enthusiasm:**
- "I love the Grasshoppers. They are so fun. I did all six last year, and registered for all six again this year."
- "Gorgeous terrain, fantastic rolling roads, big climbs and big descents and best group ride vibe around. It's so much better than any Fondo."
- "Thanks for a great day to everyone who came out, and to the organizers. This was my first year at the Hoppers, and it is a great series; I will be back next year."

**Rider Tips from Forums:**
- Compact crankset and 27+ cassette recommended for challenging terrain

- Learn "how to ride a paceline and in a group"
- Finding the right pace group is important
- Sample finish: "77 miles and 7,700 feet of climbing in 5 hours 14 minutes"
