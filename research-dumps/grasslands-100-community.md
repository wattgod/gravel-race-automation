# GRASSLANDS 100 — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**From Half Marathon Guide [COMPETITIVE]:** The course requires readiness for "real trail running conditions – which means that participants will need to be ready to run across streams, through muddy bogs, as well as sand and underbrush." The terrain is classified as "Challenging" and takes place in "Texas backcountry." (https://www.halfmarathons.net/races/grasslands-trail-run-100-mile-50-mile-marathon-half-marathon-15k/)

The course is structured as "an out-and-back loop course that starts and finishes at the TADRA Point Camping Area within the Grasslands park area, near the intersection of FS Road 900 and FS 904." It's "divided into four loop sections marked by the colors Yellow, Blue, Red and White." (https://www.halfmarathons.net/races/grasslands-trail-run-100-mile-50-mile-marathon-half-marathon-15k/)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**[COMPETITIVE] - Water Carrying:** Per course description, "there are no water sources or electricity available in the grasslands, so organizers add that you'll need to bring water for your start and for your finish line refreshment." While aid stations provide water and sports drinks on course, self-sufficiency for start/finish is required.

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

The Grasslands Trail Run takes place across "more than 20,000 acres of rural grasslands" in the Caddo and Lyndon B. Johnson National Grasslands, an area "as popular for its wildlife viewing as for hunting, fishing, mountain biking, camping and horseback riding." (https://www.halfmarathons.net/races/grasslands-trail-run-100-mile-50-mile-marathon-half-marathon-15k/)

**YouTube race video [UNKNOWN]:** Seth's experience at the "Blaze Trails 'Grasslands 100 Mile Ultramarathon'" suggests the race presented unexpected difficulty: "Initially going into this race, Seth did not realize just how much he..." (video titled "The Grasslands 100 Miler || Stick it out"). (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7mBGtpYxu4)
