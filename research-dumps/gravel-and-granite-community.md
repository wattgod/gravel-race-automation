## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Todd Meerdink [COMPETITIVE]:** "I'm a strong mid-pack performer whose primary weakness is hanging with the skinny guys when the big hills come. The climbing was my largest concern, as the within the first six miles we were to climb Rib mountain – a two-mile, 700ft climb to the peak of the local ski hill. I knew if I lost the lead group on this climb, this race would quickly turn into just a group ride." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/2019-ironbull-granite-grinder-race-report-wausau-wisconsin-by-todd-meerdink/)

**Todd Meerdink [COMPETITIVE]:** "Staying with this group as long as I could would be crucial to my race. Fortunately, the other five riders were completing the 140-mile route, and my presence wasn't a concern. Riding wheel to wheel, we hit the gravel roads in just a few miles... Riding wheel to wheel through the cover of 100ft pines, I was starting to feel the stress of maintaining pace with this group." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/2019-ironbull-granite-grinder-race-report-wausau-wisconsin-by-todd-meerdink/)

**Jacob [RECREATIONAL]:** "Working full time with two children didn't leave much time for training. Thankfully my family was supportive and understanding. I was riding at least 3 times a week. Typically it was 2 shorter, high intensity rides and 1 longer distance (50+ mile) ride." (https://www.ironbull.org/in-the-news/grinder-2022-race-report-jacob)

**Jacob [RECREATIONAL]:** "I had never attempted a climb quite like this and was a bit nervous as I live in a relatively flat part of Wisconsin and there aren't many opportunities for hill training... I spent the next 15 minutes grinding in my lowest gear with snow falling off the trees as we ascended. I had to keep reminding myself not to push too hard on this climb, there was still an entire course to finish afterwards." (https://www.ironbull.org/in-the-news/grinder-2022-race-report-jacob)

**Jacob [RECREATIONAL]:** "Shortly after departing I tried shifting into my larger front chainring and the chain just fell off. Luckily nothing was damaged and I was able to quickly seat my chain but I decided it wasn't worth the risk of trying to shift my front chainring any further. I would spend the rest of the race in my small front chainring, unable to fully take advantage of the downhill descents." (https://www.ironbull.org/in-the-news/grinder-2022-race-report-jacob)

**Jacob [RECREATIONAL]:** "The first 50 miles of the course had worn my body, the next 20 miles were a mental grind. This part of course was navigating the crushed red granite gravel roads and never ending rolling hills. By this point in the race most of the other riders were ahead of me and I would only occasionally catch a glimpse of another rider in the distance." (https://www.ironbull.org/in-the-news/grinder-2022-race-report-jacob)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Todd Meerdink [COMPETITIVE]:** Successfully rode with 40mm tires on chunky sections: "I was surprised how well my 40mm tires handled the chunky sections" during the rocky descent down Rib Mountain. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/2019-ironbull-granite-grinder-race-report-wausau-wisconsin-by-todd-meerdink/)

**Todd Meerdink [COMPETITIVE]:** Used a Camelback hydration system to avoid stopping at aid stations: "I brought a Camelback so I wouldn't need to stop at the aid stations" (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/2019-ironbull-granite-grinder-race-report-wausau-wisconsin-by-todd-meerdink/)

**Jacob [RECREATIONAL]:** Made last-minute gear addition for weather: "I also made a last minute stop to Rib Mountain Cycles to grab a pair of shoe covers in case the forecast of rain came true the next day." (https://www.ironbull.org/in-the-news/grinder-2022-race-report-jacob)

**Bike versatility [UNKNOWN]:** "While it's advertised as a gravel event, mountain bikes, e-bikes, and adaptive bikes are welcome... Gravel n Granite welcomes gravel bikes, mountain bikes, e-bikes and adaptive riders on hand cycles." (https://flowmountainbike.com/post-all/gravel-n-granite-is-returns-in-2025/)

## Weather Experienced

**2022 Race Day [RECREATIONAL]:** "After looking at the chilly forecast on race day, I couldn't muster the motivation to ride in the snow the day before... The next day I woke at 4 am... In the excitement, the damp chill in the air didn't seem quite so bad... I spent the next 15 minutes grinding in my lowest gear with snow falling off the trees as we ascended." Cold, damp conditions with active snowfall during the climb. (https://www.ironbull.org/in-the-news/grinder-2022-race-report-jacob)

**2022 Course Conditions [RECREATIONAL]:** "The muddy and sloppy track was one of the most difficult portions to navigate... I passed a racer changing a flat and watched as another nearly lost control with their hardtail MTB in the slop. Once I finally rolled back out on the road, my tires were completely caked in mud... I spent the next 18 miles grinding through the wet gravel, hills and wind." (https://www.ironbull.org/in-the-news/grinder-2022-race-report-jacob)

**2026 Date Change:** "2026 GnG will be held in May, to make the most of the cooler weather and beautiful autumn landscapes" - shifted from March to May dates. (https://www.nsw.gov.au/visiting-and-exploring-nsw/nsw-events/gravel-n-granite-tenterfield)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Rib Mountain Climb [COMPETITIVE]:** "Within the first six miles we were to climb Rib mountain – a two-mile, 700ft climb to the peak of the local ski hill... At the peak I was in about 10th, about two minutes behind, and knew I needed to make up some time." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/2019-ironbull-granite-grinder-race-report-wausau-wisconsin-by-todd-meerdink/)

**Rib Mountain Descent [COMPETITIVE]:** "The next unique billing of the Ironbull was the route down the mountain. A ¾ mile boulder laden trail, officially marked as a hike-a-bike, put a unique twist on the descent. Traversing the trail with a bike on my shoulder proved challenging... About one third down the hill, we were able to remount our bikes and ride down a rocky gravel service road to the base of the hill." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/2019-ironbull-granite-grinder-race-report-wausau-wisconsin-by-todd-meerdink/)

**Wisconsin Gravel Surface [COMPETITIVE]:** "The gravel in central Wisconsin is unlike the chunky grey gravel in the rest of the state. Rather, it is mix of red crushed granite, which makes for a much smoother, faster ride. Not to mention, the granite roads were in fantastic shape. With very few potholes, they were some of the best maintained gravel roads I have ridden." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/2019-ironbull-granite-grinder-race-report-wausau-wisconsin-by-todd-meerdink/)

**Billy Goat Hill [COMPETITIVE]:** "The second largest climb on the course was Billy Goat Hill. A series of two long climbs that flirted with a 15% grade... Getting a running start, I pedaled hard downhill in an attempt to hit the climb with as much speed as possible. Reaching 40mph on the descent I used every bit of momentum to start the climb. Unfortunately, the hill stopped my momentum quite rapidly and continued to push up the hill at a snail's pace." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/2019-ironbull-granite-grinder-race-report-wausau-wisconsin-by-todd-meerdink/)

**Speedway Double Track [RECREATIONAL]:** "Cutting through the woods, the muddy and sloppy track was one of the most difficult portions to navigate. I was able to appreciate the beautiful scenery of a forest in peak fall colors as I struggled with traction on the ascents and had to walk my bike in spots." (https://www.ironbull.org/in-the-news/grinder-2022-race-report-jacob)

**Scotch Creek Trail [RECREATIONAL]:** "What would it be like to ride a gravel bike on a mountain bike single track course? That question was answered in Scotch Creek. The narrow trails had plenty of roots and rocks that proved too much for my skills and gravel bike. I had to walk my bike in more than one spot. It was still slow going in the rideable parts." (https://www.ironbull.org/in-the-news/grinder-2022-race-report-jacob)

**2025 Range Rumble Course:** "The crux of the day will come at about 50km, where you'll climb for about 10km, including an absolute wall with grades in excess of 15%! With 59% gravel and 41% bitumen... There will be four fully stocked feed stations at 29km, 46km, 63km, and 73km." (https://flowmountainbike.com/post-all/gravel-n-granite-is-returns-in-2025/)

**2025 Course Changes:** "Many of the roads that we have used in previous years are now sealed, so we had to create completely new courses... In 2025, Gravel 'n Granite will feature five new courses" - completely redesigned from 2023 edition. (https://flowmountainbike.com/post-all/gravel-n-granite-is-returns-in-2025/)

**Basket Swamp Bash Creek Crossing:** "There is one creek crossing with a concrete base that's usually about 25-30cm deep" on the adaptive-friendly 38km course. (https://flowmountainbike.com/post-all/gravel-n-granite-is-returns-in-2025/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Early Climb Pacing [RECREATIONAL]:** "I had to keep reminding myself not to push too hard on this climb, there was still an entire course to finish afterwards. But I was still filled with the excitement of this being my first race and probably pushed harder than I needed too." - Common first-timer mistake of going too hard on early Rib Mountain climb. (https://www.ironbull.org/in-the-news/grinder-2022-race-report-jacob)

**Group Riding Strategy [COMPETITIVE]:** "Catching up to this group was my golden ticket. I knew these guys from a local cycling club, and had ridden with them in the past. They're strong. Really strong, and I usually would get dropped at some point during a ride. Staying with this group as long as I could would be crucial to my race... I managed to stay with the group until just before the 140 and 86-mile routes diverged." Strategy of hanging with faster riders on longer route before split. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/2019-ironbull-granite-grinder-race-report-wausau-wisconsin-by-todd-meerdink/)

**Aid Station Strategy [COMPETITIVE]:** "I brought a Camelback so I wouldn't need to stop at the aid stations, but I sure wanted I shot of Fireball to help dull the pain I was feeling in my legs." Decision to skip stops saved time. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/2019-ironbull-granite-grinder-race-report-wausau-wisconsin-by-todd-meerdink/)

**Nutrition Failure [RECREATIONAL]:** "I hadn't eaten since the first aid station and I was feeling the consequences. After emerging from the trees I stopped and dug out some Oreos I had tossed into my bag on a whim and did my best cookie monster impression. The sugar rush helped lift my spirits." Bonked after ~40 miles without eating. (https://www.ironbull.org/in-the-news/grinder-2022-race-report-jacob)

**Gas Station Stop Decision [RECREATIONAL]:** "I saw some other racers peel off to the BP gas station with several bikes already leaning against the building. I debated on stopping myself but decided to push on. I knew going in and warming up would just make it that much harder to come back out into the cold." (https://www.ironbull.org/in-the-news/grinder-2022-race-report-jacob)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Mechanical Issues - Drivetrain [RECREATIONAL]:** "I felt my chain bind when switching gears on my front chainring. A quick back pedal and the chain finished shifting without incident, I silently hoped this was a one time fluke... Shortly after departing I tried shifting into my larger front chainring and the chain just fell off... I would spend the rest of the race in my small front chainring, unable to fully take advantage of the downhill descents." Front derailleur issues forced single-chainring riding for remainder of race. (https://www.ironbull.org/in-the-news/grinder-2022-race-report-jacob)

**Flat Tires in Mud [RECREATIONAL]:** "I passed a racer changing a flat" in the muddy Speedway double track section. (https://www.ironbull.org/in-the-news/grinder-2022-race-report-jacob)

**Loss of Control Risk [RECREATIONAL]:** "I watched as another nearly lost control with their hardtail MTB in the slop" during muddy conditions. (https://www.ironbull.org/in-the-news/grinder-2022-race-report-jacob)

**Technical Skills Required [RECREATIONAL]:** "The narrow trails had plenty of roots and rocks that proved too much for my skills and gravel bike. I had to walk my bike in more than one spot" at Scotch Creek - riders without MTB skills may struggle. (https://www.ironbull.org/in-the-news/grinder-2022-race-report-jacob)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Event Atmosphere [RECREATIONAL]:** "It was a lively atmosphere with the live band and I even got to meet a Strava friend (Kevin) in person while waiting in line... I felt the electricity at the dawn start. The air was electric as 300 riders left under police escort out of downtown Wausau." (https://www.ironbull.org/in-the-news/grinder-2022-race-report-jacob)

**Race Village Experience:** "This vibe will carry through the weekend, with DJs, food trucks, and local beer and wine at the Tenterfield Showgrounds Race Village — the ideal place to unwind and celebrate after an epic day of riding." (https://flowmountainbike.com/post-all/gravel-n-granite-is-returns-in-2025/)

**Weekend Festival Vibe:** "It's a weekend for the whole family, starting Friday night in the main street of Tenterfield. Riders can register in town, enjoy live music, and eat at local restaurants offering special events for everyone." (https://flowmountainbike.com/post-all/gravel-n-granite-is-returns-in-2025/)

**Inclusive Racing Philosophy [COMPETITIVE]:** "While there is a racing aspect to the event with prizes for the fastest two riders in each category, on each course, the focus is on the adventure and the landscape around you... It is a race with a running clock, but Reid tells us it's organised to be as welcoming as possible to all riders, regardless of their FTP." (https://flowmountainbibe.com/post-all/gravel-n-granite-is-returns-in-2025/)

**Aid Station Extras:** "Everything from sweet and salty treats, to Fireball whiskey were available to fuel riders for the day" - aid stations offered alcohol alongside traditional nutrition. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/2019-ironbull-granite-grinder-race-report-wausau-wisconsin-by-todd-meerdink/)

**Course Support:** "Reid also tells us there will be volunteers strategically placed along the course for moral support, that will also have food, water and first aid supplies." (https://flowmountainbike.com/post-all/gravel-n-granite-is-returns-in-2025/)

**Family Finish [RECREATIONAL]:** "Crossing the finish line with my wife and children cheering me on." (https://www.ironbull.org/in-the-news/grinder-2022-race-report-jacob)
