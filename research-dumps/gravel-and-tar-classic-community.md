# GRAVEL AND TAR CLASSIC — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Brodie Chapman [ELITE]:** "That was the most fun I've had on a bike – ever!" (2019 winner, commenting on podium after winning inaugural La Femme race) (https://steve-stannard.squarespace.com/classicuci)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Anonymous commenter [UNKNOWN]:** Criticized tire choices at the event: "They talk a lot about luck, due to all the punctures. But tire choice and riding style have huge influences on that. Getting flats if you are choosing to run 25mm, 180 tpi tubulars, and charging full gas across rocky gravel is not bad luck, just bad choices." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/videos/video-2018-gravel-tar-classic-manawatu-region-new-zealand/)

**Note:** The commenter suggests that punctures were often attributed to "luck" but were actually related to running narrow tubulars (25mm, 180 tpi) on rocky gravel sections while riding aggressively.

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

The race features **multiple gravel sectors (usually 5 or 6)** throughout the course, with approximately **90km/56 miles of sealed roads and 45km/28 miles of gravel** (2018 edition). (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/videos/video-2018-gravel-tar-classic-manawatu-region-new-zealand/)

The course often **traverses gravel roads on watersheds near Pohangina**, and "the peloton is easily fractured due to punctures & crashes on these sectors." The gravel sectors are described as **"rocky gravel"** by community members. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravel_and_Tar_Classic)

The race distance is approximately **155km for the men's elite race** (https://steve-stannard.squarespace.com/) and **139.38km in 2024** (https://www.cyclingranking.com/races/2024/gravel-and-tar-classic), with the women's La Femme following a **shorter but similar course**. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravel_and_Tar_Classic)

The race is described as **"approximately 75% sealed and 25% gravel roads"** in promotional materials. (https://steve-stannard.squarespace.com/classicuci)

## DNF Risk Factors

**High attrition rate:** "As a result of these fractures the race will very rarely see large bunches finish together, and **many racers miss the time cut or are unable to finish**." (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravel_and_Tar_Classic)

**Primary mechanical issues:** Punctures are the dominant mechanical failure mode, with the gravel sectors causing significant attrition through flats. Video promoters noted riders frequently discussing "luck" related to puncture avoidance. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/videos/video-2018-gravel-tar-classic-manawatu-region-new-zealand/)

**Course fragmentation:** The peloton is "easily fractured" on gravel sectors, making it difficult to regain contact with groups if dropped due to mechanicals or positioning errors. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravel_and_Tar_Classic)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

The race is **"considered to be the toughest one-day elite race in the Oceania region"** and is known for being **"one of the toughest race on the women's road calendar."** (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravel_and_Tar_Classic, https://steve-stannard.squarespace.com/)

The event is **"one of a few elite female cycle races in the world where the prizemoney on offer is the same as the men's race"** — a notable equity feature that attracted international attention. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravel_and_Tar_Classic)

The race has expanded into a **weekend festival atmosphere** called the **Manawatu Cycling Spree** (introduced 2021), including:
- Amateur "Slicks and Stones" events (100km and 46km options)
- eBike categories
- Retro Bike Ride (charity fundraiser for Arohanui Hospice)
- Family Fun Ride
- Multiple mountain bike challenges
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravel_and_Tar_Classic)

The **2024 Retro Ride had over 50 cyclists and supporters** and was described as "a great success" with a "friendly event to get people moving and have fun." (https://steve-stannard.squarespace.com/)

**International appeal:** The race is held in **January, making it one of the first races on the UCI Calendar**, attracting teams from Sweden, Japan, the US, Australia, and New Zealand seeking early-season UCI points. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravel_and_Tar_Classic)

**Operational challenges:** The race was **cancelled in 2025 due to lack of entries**, raising questions about its future viability despite its reputation. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravel_and_Tar_Classic)
