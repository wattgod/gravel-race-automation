# GRAVEL BATTLE OF SUMTER FOREST — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Marni (Trimarni Coaching) [RECREATIONAL]:** "You may think that with Clinton being in the Piedmont region of South Carolina that the terrain means an easier ride. Don't be fooled, everyone who finishes this event knows it was much harder than they anticipated." (https://www.trimarnicoach.com/trimarniblog/2021/03/gravel-battle-of-sumter-forest-race.html)

**Marni [RECREATIONAL]:** "When I reached the gravel section, it was so dusty that I could barely see anything. This freaked me out a bit and I found myself slowing down to stay safe." (https://www.trimarnicoach.com/trimarniblog/2021/03/gravel-battle-of-sumter-forest-race.html)

**Marni [RECREATIONAL]:** "I just riding along (famous last words) until I found myself rolling into a deep hole (more like a crater) on a pavement-like crossing. The hole caught me by surprise and it was too late for me to do anything as I don't have the skills to bunny hop holes yet... When my front wheel hit the hole at 21 mph, the force of my body weight on the handlebars caused them to rotate forward." (https://www.trimarnicoach.com/trimarniblog/2021/03/gravel-battle-of-sumter-forest-race.html)

**Karel (via Marni's report) [COMPETITIVE/UNKNOWN]:** "Karel later told me (after the race) that he had hoped that I would be safe and not try to race it as he had no idea that it would be so fast and packed to start the race." He noted "his first gravel race felt more like a road race." (https://www.trimarnicoach.com/trimarniblog/2021/03/gravel-battle-of-sumter-forest-race.html)

**Karel [COMPETITIVE/UNKNOWN]:** "For the first 6 mile section of gravel, his group average 23.9 mph! His HR was in the mid 160's and pretty much stayed there for the rest of the race. For the next 50 miles, Karel's group averaged 21.5 mph!" (https://www.trimarnicoach.com/trimarniblog/2021/03/gravel-battle-of-sumter-forest-race.html)

**Claire Colbert and Kathryn Taylor [UNKNOWN]:** "Being around that many people for the first time in probably over a year was weird, to say the least. I think I can speak for both of us when I say that being around that many people for the first time in probably over a year was weird, to say the least." (https://feisty.co/p/2021-3-17-we-went-to-gravel-race/)

**Claire Colbert [UNKNOWN]:** "I've never been to a gravel race where I didn't leave with new friends; the same can't be said for the many triathlons I've raced." (https://feisty.co/p/2021-3-17-we-went-to-gravel-race/)

**Anonymous racer [UNKNOWN]:** "The Sumter Forest Gravel Event brings us through the best gravel roads around. There was no traffic, the course was very challenging, and the food afterwards hit the spot. This event had me mark down every Southeast Gravel event on my calendar." (https://strambecco.com/event/gravel-battle-sumter-forest/)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Course mix:** "A good mix of gravel and road. You do a few miles of gravel and then a few miles of road - rinse and repeat for 72 miles." (https://www.trimarnicoach.com/trimarniblog/2021/03/gravel-battle-of-sumter-forest-race.html)

**Technical features:** "A few technical areas (and a river crossing, a few steep hills and a tight rocky turn)" (https://www.trimarnicoach.com/trimarniblog/2021/03/gravel-battle-of-sumter-forest-race.html)

**Finish section:** "Riding through a corn field, onto gravel and then a pitchy climb to the finish (an area that we hadn't ridden before because it's on an active shooting range)" (https://www.trimarnicoach.com/trimarniblog/2021/03/gravel-battle-of-sumter-forest-race.html)

**Iconic course features:** "One of the most iconic shots of the Sumter Forest course is the tunnels that traverse under I-26. Now both the long course and short course get to have fun in those tunnels." (https://www.southeastgravel.com/gravel-battle-of-sumter-forest)

**Dust conditions:** At the 2021 race, conditions were extremely dusty. One rider reported barely being able to see anything in the first gravel section. (https://www.trimarnicoach.com/trimarniblog/2021/03/gravel-battle-of-sumter-forest-race.html)

**Road hazards:** "The roads seemed to have a bit more loose gravel than what I was used to on this course so I had to be extra careful and attentive on the hillier sections, especially when there's holes, sand and rocks to dodge." A deep hole/crater on a pavement-like crossing after a railroad crossing and downhill section caught at least one rider. (https://www.trimarnicoach.com/trimarniblog/2021/03/gravel-battle-of-sumter-forest-race.html)

**Elevation:** Long course is 73 miles with approximately 2,100 ft of elevation gain. Short course is 49 miles with similar elevation characteristics. (https://strambecco.com/event/gravel-battle-sumter-forest/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Start intensity [COMPETITIVE/ELITE]:** "When the event started, it felt like any other bike race. It was fast, a bit chaotic as everyone got organized into a tight pack... the first few miles were fast... But what I didn't expect was the intensity of the group when we hit the first section of gravel (around mile 6). The pace didn't slow down - if anything, it got faster." (https://www.trimarnicoach.com/trimarniblog/2021/03/gravel-battle-of-sumter-forest-race.html)

**Elite/competitive pacing data:** Karel (experienced road racer) averaged 23.9 mph for the first 6-mile gravel section with HR in mid-160s, then 21.5 mph for the next 50 miles. His experience: "Because of Karel's bike racing (and lifetime of riding) experience, this gravel race felt much like a road race for him." (https://www.trimarnicoach.com/trimarniblog/2021/03/gravel-battle-of-sumter-forest-race.html)

**Recreational pacing [RECREATIONAL]:** Marni (new to gravel, ~10 rides total before race) averaged 21 mph in first section before crash, then dealt with significant mental challenges and rode final 8 miles of gravel solo. (https://www.trimarnicoach.com/trimarniblog/2021/03/gravel-battle-of-sumter-forest-race.html)

**Hydration/nutrition strategy [RECREATIONAL]:** "Since I had two bottles on my bike of sport nutrition along with a Camelback of 1.5L of sport drink, I didn't need to make any stops." This allowed skipping all aid stations. (https://www.trimarnicoach.com/trimarniblog/2021/03/gravel-battle-of-sumter-forest-race.html)

**Elite results [ELITE]:** In 2021, "the top 10 riders finished together, sprinting for the win within a few seconds" of winner Scott McGill. Winning time implied fast road-race-like pace. (https://granfondodailynews.com/2021/03/17/stacked-pro-field-goes-head-to-head-at-battle-gravel-of-sumter-forest-results/)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Crashes:** "There was a crash on the gravel sometime in the first 10 miles but I think everyone that crashed there finished." (https://www.trimarnicoach.com/trimarniblog/2021/03/gravel-battle-of-sumter-forest-race.html)

**Road hazards causing crashes:** Deep holes/craters on pavement crossings after railroad crossings have caused at least one significant crash resulting in handlebar rotation and road rash. (https://www.trimarnicoach.com/trimarniblog/2021/03/gravel-battle-of-sumter-forest-race.html)

**Mental challenges post-incident [RECREATIONAL]:** After crashing, Marni experienced significant negative thoughts: "Quitting, taking the shorter route, never riding gravel again. All of these negative thoughts crept in my head - I'm not good enough, what an embarrassment for me to be out here, I am not having fun I just want to go home, etc. For the next ten miles, I really fought through some negative thoughts and emotions." (https://www.trimarnicoach.com/trimarniblog/2021/03/gravel-battle-of-sumter-forest-race.html)

**Mechanical issues:** Flats occurred during the race (Enzo Hincapie had a flat). (https://www.trimarnicoach.com/trimarniblog/2021/03/gravel-battle-of-sumter-forest-race.html)

**Cramping [COMPETITIVE]:** Karel "cramped near the end" and "had nothing left" despite being an experienced cyclist. (https://www.trimarnicoach.com/trimarniblog/2021/03/gravel-battle-of-sumter-forest-race.html)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Event size:** 2021 race had "nearly 400 cyclists registered for either the long or short course" making it "one of the largest in-person gravel races to take place during the pandemic." (https://www.trimarnicoach.com/trimarniblog/2021/03/gravel-battle-of-sumter-forest-race.html and https://granfondodailynews.com/2021/03/17/stacked-pro-field-goes-head-to-head-at-battle-gravel-of-sumter-forest-results/)

**Pre-race energy:** "When we arrived to the race venue around 7:45am, you could feel the energy. With nearly 400 cyclists registered for either the long or short course, there was a lot of energy in the air that people were itching to race. I think more than the race itself, an event brings a community together - a community of like-minded individuals who love to ride bikes." (https://www.trimarnicoach.com/trimarniblog/2021/03/gravel-battle-of-sumter-forest-race.html)

**Gravel race culture:** "Gravel events are basically just a party with a bike ride to kick things off… You can ride them as hard or as easy as you want on whatever bike you want (for the most part lol). And then everyone gets to share a beer (or two or three!) and usually some good food at the end." (https://feisty.co/p/2021-3-17-we-went-to-gravel-race/)

**Post-race amenities:** "Free Food/Free Beer - Go as hard as you want, and know that a hot meal and a cold refreshing beer will be awaiting you at the finish line. Stick around and cheer on fellow riders who are finishing." (https://www.southeastgravel.com/gravel-battle-of-sumter-forest)

**Equal pay:** "With equal pay for both the men and women (which is not typical in many cycling events), this brought more pro women to the event." The 2021 race had "20 Pro Women and 40 Pro Men" creating a "stacked field." (https://www.trimarnicoach.com/trimarniblog/2021/03/gravel-battle-of-sumter-forest-race.html and https://granfondodailynews.com/2021/03/17/stacked-pro-field-goes-head-to-head-at-battle-gravel-of-sumter-forest-results/)

**Organizer reputation:** "Ben and Boyd of Southeast gravel are just plain awesome so their presence alone brings along good people who love bikes." (https://www.trimarnicoach.com/trimarniblog/2021/03/gravel-battle-of-sumter-forest-race.html)
