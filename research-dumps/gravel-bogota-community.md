## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

### Colombian Cycling Culture Context

**Janosch Wintermantel [ELITE]** (from racing TransCordilleras across Colombia): "Colombians live and breathe cycling like no other nation in the world. Bogota is easily the city with the most bike shops worldwide. Patios and Palmas are the two most ridden climbs in the world according to Strava and are located in Colombia. You will find thousands of riders climbing up there every day on their commute to work." (https://gravelunion.cc/article/transcordilleras-colombian-adventure)

**Janosch Wintermantel [ELITE]:** "Colombians have an incredible amount of 'grinta' which translates as pluck, grit, determination or resolve. They simply love to race like no one else. There was no holding back or saving any kind of energy for the next day during the stage. It felt like they were just thinking of the moment, not what was still coming on the rest of the stage or even the next days. They love to attack whenever they can." (https://gravelunion.cc/article/transcordilleras-colombian-adventure)

**Rich Costello [ELITE]** (from cycling in Colombia): "As we merged onto a busy highway at 6am on a Sunday morning we could have been mistaken for thinking we'd entered a Gran Fondo. Hundreds of cyclists on all kinds of bikes zipped casually along... We'd pay for it later as the climbs began, but that was ok, we were finally in Colombia!" (https://steedcycles.com/blogs/steed-cycles/podcast-colombia-dreaming-part-two)

**Rich Costello [ELITE]:** "For the most part though, the drivers we encountered were friendly and gave plenty of room when passing, often sharing an encouraging honk and a wave. Many Colombians' love cycling and we felt very welcome in the country." (https://steedcycles.com/blogs/steed-cycles/podcast-colombia-dreaming-part-two)

**Rich Costello [ELITE]** (on Colombian racing culture): "Our final day in Bogota coincided with the final stage of the Tour of Colombia and we pitched up three hours early at the finish area to watch the riders cross the line. The scenes that day will live long. People of all ages chanting the names of their heroes 'Rigo, Rigo, Nairo, Nairo, Egan, Egan'." (https://steedcycles.com/blogs/steed-cycles/podcast-colombia-dreaming-part-two)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Janosch Wintermantel [ELITE]** used a Kona Ouroboros gravel bike with **2.25 Maxxis Aspen tires and 50 mm of Fox suspension** for TransCordilleras in Colombia: "The Ouroboros with 2.25 Maxxis Aspen tires and 50 mm of Fox suspension was built for this and we rock and rolled passing a number of riders" on a rugged 1000-meter vertical descent through the jungle. (https://gravelunion.cc/article/transcordilleras-colombian-adventure)

**Note:** Elite riders competing in Colombian terrain are opting for wider tires (2.25") and suspension for technical gravel descents. This setup is significantly more capable than typical gravel race equipment.

**Cory Wallace [ELITE]** experienced a critical equipment failure: "my carbon seat post broken" during TransCordilleras Stage 7, requiring "pounding bamboo into the inside of the seat post to provide some support" to finish. (http://corywallace.com/2025/04/early-season-racing-25/)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

### Colombian Gravel Characteristics

**Janosch Wintermantel [ELITE]:** "Colombian gravel is not comparable to the smooth surface most of us are used to in Europe or the US." (https://gravelunion.cc/article/transcordilleras-colombian-adventure)

**Janosch Wintermantel [ELITE]** on TransCordilleras racing conditions: "The race takes place in open traffic with huge potholes, dogs chasing you and cows standing in your way all on your daily menu." (https://gravelunion.cc/article/transcordilleras-colombian-adventure)

### Altitude & Climbing Context

**Janosch Wintermantel [ELITE]:** "As a comparison the highest paved pass in Europe is the mighty Col d'Iseran at 2764m, **more than 1000 meters lower than many of the climbs in Colombia**!" (https://gravelunion.cc/article/transcordilleras-colombian-adventure)

**Cory Wallace [ELITE]** on TransCordilleras Stage 4: "a hot and exposed 1500 vertical meter climb to the finish. This stage saw some of the best meltdowns all week with riders all over the mountainside looking for sweets and drinks at the roadside gas stations and local stands. It was a tough day on the bikes as the early mud clogged everything up before getting sun baked onto our bikes on the long exposed climb." (http://corywallace.com/2025/04/early-season-racing-25/)

**Cory Wallace [ELITE]** on Stage 5 climbing to **4150m**: "Stage 5 started with a 50 km climb straight up a stunning paved road to El Sifon pass (4150 m) before dropping down a winding decent to race finish at 2900 m." (http://corywallace.com/2025/04/early-season-racing-25/)

## Weather Experienced

**Janosch Wintermantel [ELITE]** on TransCordilleras Stage 1 conditions: "It turned into a proper trudge, getting dropped early from the lead group of 10 riders. Riding in no man's land, GPX track on my computer randomly got deleted... The scenery through the jungle was lush with some brilliant rock out cropping's which were visible whenever the clouds lifted in the Colombian mist." (https://gravelunion.cc/article/transcordilleras-colombian-adventure)

**Janosch Wintermantel [ELITE]** on Stage 7 (queen stage) weather: "Heavy rain and cold temperatures greeted us at the startline... When we crossed the second of the two Paramo climbs it was pouring down again with **temperatures of less than 5 degrees Celsius at the top**. The sun came out and the lower altitude made me rediscover my strength." (https://gravelunion.cc/article/transcordilleras-colombian-adventure)

**Rich Costello [ELITE]:** "Day one was meant to be easy. Bogota sits at 2600m, and we were descending to the Magdalena Valley where we'd crush 50km of false flat before checking in to El Hotel de los Ciclistas in Mariquita for a good night's rest. It didn't quite turn out that way." (https://steedcycles.com/blogs/steed-cycles/podcast-colombia-dreaming-part-two)

**Cory Wallace [ELITE]** on TransCordilleras Stage 1 start: "Waking up at 4:30 am to a resurgent's of my flu and and a solid rainstorm. With 137 km & 4000 m of climbing on deck through a remote Colombian national park, it was going to be a tough day." (http://corywallace.com/2025/04/early-season-racing-25/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

### Nutrition & Pacing Lessons [ELITE Level]

**Janosch Wintermantel [ELITE]** on a critical nutrition mistake: "I don't know what I was thinking before stage 1, but the idea to only bring nuts as my on-bike nutrition turned out to be costly on the last 15km of the stage. By that point I was leading the race with Brayan, the brother of Esteban Chaves, when I completely bonked. Losing 10 minutes on the last 15km. The tank was empty and another lesson learned." (https://gravelunion.cc/article/transcordilleras-colombian-adventure)

**Cory Wallace [ELITE]** on self-supported racing: "With the race being fully self-supported, these types of oasis's were important to restock on race supplies and make sure the bikes were ready for the upcoming stages. My front wheel needed a truing and the bike some TLC." (http://corywallace.com/2025/04/early-season-racing-25/)

### Racing Tactics [ELITE Level]

**Janosch Wintermantel [ELITE]:** "Stage 5 was a hot and mainly flat one. We wrestled the field down to 8 riders before entering the last few kilometres. The last 3 kilometres were then a crazy hunt in open traffic. Mauricio Ardila attacked first. We passed cars left and right, sprinted in front of oncoming buses, cut off a police car to then sprint it out in the last meters." (https://gravelunion.cc/article/transcordilleras-colombian-adventure)

**Cory Wallace [ELITE]** on Stage 6 tactics: "Stage 6 was a shorter 60 km day which turned into a lightning-fast stage as we all morphed our diesel engines into proper high end race machines." (http://corywallace.com/2025/04/early-season-racing-25/)

## DNF Risk Factors

### Mechanical Issues

**Janosch Wintermantel [ELITE]:** "The hole I got in my tyre from the previous day opened up again, but this time I couldn't properly seal it. As a result, I had to ride the entire stage on extremely low tyre pressure, stopped countless times to put extra air in and I lost almost an hour to Laurens. I was already out of the GC (general contender) rankings, but at least happily I made it to the finish line." (https://gravelunion.cc/article/transcordilleras-colombian-adventure)

**Janosch Wintermantel [ELITE]** on Stage 7 near-catastrophe: "I suddenly got a massive hit in a rocky descent on my rear wheel. It was a miracle that I stay upright, but as a result my rear wheel was completely off set and my front and rear derailleurs stopped working entirely, which meant **I was left with 1 gear and had 52km and more than 1000m of climbing left**." (https://gravelunion.cc/article/transcordilleras-colombian-adventure)

### Health & Altitude

**Cory Wallace [ELITE]** on illness during TransCordilleras: "Unfortunately, the body was fighting off a bad flu for a couple weeks which was still lingering on race morning... Heading to Colombia, still dragging the tail end of the flu, the fingers were crossed things would turn around before the 8-day, 1000 km bike packing race across the South American country." His flu persisted through the first few stages before finally improving. (http://corywallace.com/2025/04/early-season-racing-25/)

**Cory Wallace [ELITE]** on altitude challenges: "Stage 4 started with a 20km climb up to Alto de la Linea, sitting above 3300meters. It was a tough climb with beautiful views on the Cocora Valley and its palm trees. I didn't have my best day, the altitude and my tired legs made it a tough day in the office." (http://corywallace.com/2025/04/early-season-racing-25/)

### Travel/Logistics Issues

**Cory Wallace [ELITE]** experienced a travel crisis before Cape Epic: "Unfortunately when checking into the flight from Bogota to London, the Avianca airlines staff kindly told me I couldn't check in without a Yellow Fever Vaccination. Thankfully I had a digital copy of this from South Africa in 2021. Unfortunately they wouldn't accept anything but a physical copy." (http://corywallace.com/2025/04/early-season-racing-25/)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Rich Costello [ELITE]:** "I've always believed that experiences like this are better when shared with friends... Something special happens when you're part of a team and I know I could not have kept going every day without help at times (electrolytes and Imodium on day 3 for example)." (https://steedcycles.com/blogs/steed-cycles/podcast-colombia-dreaming-part-two)

**Janosch Wintermantel [ELITE]:** "Jardin was a great finish to the week with the afternoon spent at the resort celebrating the last 8 days of memories and stories made riding across Colombia. After a night out on the town taking in another weekend night in Colombia, we caught some rest." (https://gravelunion.cc/article/transcordilleras-colombian-adventure)

**Cory Wallace [ELITE]:** "That night we finished in a country town called Tamesis with a buzzing central square. Being Friday night, it filled up with locals, including a bunch of cowboys. **It's tough to match the energy of a Latin American town on a weekend night!**" (http://corywallace.com/2025/04/early-season-racing-25/)

**Rich Costello [ELITE]:** "This trip has changed all of that. Colombia offered up a total sensory experience that is unlike anything else and a cycling challenge that my legs and lungs won't forget in a hurry." (https://steedcycles.com/blogs/steed-cycles/podcast-colombia-dreaming-part-two)
