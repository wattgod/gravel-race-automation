Gravel Bogotá is scheduled for **Sunday, May 24, 2026**, in Chía, Bogotá, Colombia, as part of the UCI Gravel World Series (qualifier for the 2026 UCI Gravel World Championships)[1][2][3][4][5][6][7]. One source lists it as May 23, 2026, but the majority confirm May 24[3]. No 2025 date found; it appears to debut or expand in the 2026 UCI series[1][5]. No information available on 2026 dates beyond this event, registration costs/entry fees, field size, distance options/elevation gain, prize purse, start location/time, aid stations, or cutoff times. Registration opened January 1, 2026, per Gran Fondo Guide[7].

## TERRAIN & COURSE
No specific details found on surface breakdown (% gravel, pavement, singletrack, dirt), key course features/named climbs/sectors, technical difficulty, or elevation profile. Known info from query indicates ~80 miles distance and 8000 ft elevation, but unconfirmed in search results. Location in Chía near Bogotá suggests hilly terrain typical of the region, but no direct confirmation[1][3][4].

## CLIMATE & CONDITIONS
No data found on typical weather for May 24 in Chía/Bogotá, historical weather incidents (mud, heat, wind), starting elevation, or max elevation. Bogotá's high altitude (~8500 ft/2600m) is generally known, aligning with query's 8000 ft total gain, but race-specific details unavailable.

## LOGISTICS
No information available on nearest airport (likely El Dorado International Airport, BOG, ~20km from Chía/Bogotá), lodging options/strategy, parking, or packet pickup.

## COMMUNITY & REPUTATION
Gravel Bogotá is a new or expanding addition to the UCI Gravel World Series 2026, highlighted for South American growth alongside events in Argentina and Medellín[1][2][4][5]. Part of a record **45-event series** where elites race with amateurs for Worlds qualification[1][6]. No race history (founded year, founder), notable past winners/pro riders, rider reviews/quotes (Reddit/forums/race reports), YouTube coverage, or community perception found—likely due to its upcoming/new status in 2026 calendar. A second Colombian event, **Gravel Medellín**, follows on August 8-9, 2026, by the same organizing team behind Brazil/Chile/Bogotá races[1].

## RACE REPORTS & RIDER EXPERIENCE
