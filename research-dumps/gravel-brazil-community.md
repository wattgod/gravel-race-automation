# GRAVEL BRAZIL — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Maddy Nutt [ELITE]:** "It was unbelievably hot—felt like 50°C. I didn't know the course at all. By the end, I had cramps in my legs. In the first 28km, I wasn't even trying to attack, but I found myself leading at the top of a climb and just kept my own pace. I'm so happy to have won."

**Simon Pellaud [ELITE]:** "It was a tough route, and the heat was intense. My legs weren't at their best after racing in Colombia last week. The pace was high and only kept increasing. I even had to stop at the feed zone to grab water and cool off." (https://www.cyclingnews.com/races/uci-gravel-world-series-events-2025/gravel-brazil/results/)

## Weather Experienced

**2025 Edition:** Temperatures exceeded 35°C during the race, with elite winner Maddy Nutt reporting it "felt like 50°C." The extreme heat was a major factor, with winner Simon Pellaud having to stop at the feed zone specifically to cool off.

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Course Composition:** The 111km course featured 90% gravel roads with only a small section on paved roads in the middle. The course design had the first and last 36km mainly following the same roads. (https://ucigravelworldseries.com/en/camboriu/)

**Elevation Profile:** The race included 1,600-2,000m of total climbing (sources vary between 1,778m and 2,000m). A significant 5km climb at the 75km mark was a key feature, averaging 7% gradient. Three short but steep climbs varying between 1-2km with gradients up to 10% were positioned in the middle part of the course.

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Heat Management Critical [ELITE]:** Elite winner Simon Pellaud, despite being a professional cyclist who had just won an 8-day stage race the week before, still needed to stop at the feed zone for water and cooling. This suggests aggressive hydration and cooling strategies are essential regardless of fitness level. (https://www.cyclingnews.com/races/uci-gravel-world-series-events-2025/gravel-brazil/results/)

**Early Race Pacing [ELITE]:** Maddy Nutt's winning strategy involved not attacking in the first 28km, but rather maintaining her own pace on climbs, which naturally put her in the lead. She won solo after 4:42:50. (https://www.cyclingnews.com/races/uci-gravel-world-series-events-2025/gravel-brazil/results/)

**Elite Winning Pace:** Men's winner Simon Pellaud finished the 111-120km course in 3:44:43 (average 29.37-32.07 km/h). Women's winner Maddy Nutt finished in 4:42:50 (average 23.34 km/h).

**Elite Time Gaps:** In the men's race, second place was nearly 7 minutes back, and third place was almost 15 minutes behind the winner, suggesting the race fractured early. In the women's race, second place was 13 minutes back and third was 16 minutes back. (https://ucigravelworldseries.com/en/pellaud-and-nutt-celebrate-in-brazil/)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Heat-Induced Cramping:** Elite winner Maddy Nutt experienced leg cramps by the end of the race despite winning, indicating the extreme heat posed a significant physiological challenge even to top-level athletes. (https://www.cyclingnews.com/races/uci-gravel-world-series-events-2025/gravel-brazil/results/)

**Insufficient Recovery:** Simon Pellaud noted his "legs weren't at their best after racing in Colombia last week," though he still won. This suggests riders attempting this race without adequate recovery face significant performance risks. (https://www.cyclingnews.com/races/uci-gravel-world-series-events-2025/gravel-brazil/results/)
