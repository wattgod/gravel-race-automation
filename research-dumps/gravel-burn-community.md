# GRAVEL BURN — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Aaron Borrill [ELITE]:** "I thought I was prepared for Gravel Burn. I mean, I was – I did all the training and was in good shape going into the race, but I think I just underestimated everything about South Africa, particularly the region and the terrain I traversed during the seven stages. It was extremely hard on the body – particularly the hands, shoulders, neck, and arms." (https://www.cyclingweekly.com/routes/gravel-burn-is-the-toughest-off-road-stage-race-in-the-world-and-this-is-why-it-needs-to-be-on-your-bucket-list)

**Aaron Borrill [ELITE]:** "It's a beautiful race but also unforgiving. It takes no prisoners, and the moment you show any weakness, it will chew you up and spit you out." (https://www.cyclingweekly.com/routes/gravel-burn-is-the-toughest-off-road-stage-race-in-the-world-and-this-is-why-it-needs-to-be-on-your-bucket-list)

**Aaron Borrill [ELITE]:** "The number of things that can go wrong on a gravel bike never fails to amaze me. You really have to think about how you prepare, what you carry with you, and how accessible it is to quickly plug punctures and reinflate tyres." (https://www.cyclingweekly.com/routes/gravel-burn-is-the-toughest-off-road-stage-race-in-the-world-and-this-is-why-it-needs-to-be-on-your-bucket-list)

**Simon Pellaud [ELITE]:** "They told me, come to South Africa, it's summer and you'll have beautiful weather. It's beautiful, yeah, but it looks like Belgium in March." (https://www.cyclingweekly.com/routes/gravel-burn-is-the-toughest-off-road-stage-race-in-the-world-and-this-is-why-it-needs-to-be-on-your-bucket-list)

**Peter Stetina [ELITE]:** Destroyed his wheel and tyre after smashing a rock and had to ride on the rim for 10km during Stage 3. (https://www.cyclingweekly.com/routes/gravel-burn-is-the-toughest-off-road-stage-race-in-the-world-and-this-is-why-it-needs-to-be-on-your-bucket-list)

**Alistair Brownlee [ELITE]:** "I'm not in it for the medals and wins. I'm in it for the enjoyment. But, of course, I'm still going to go as hard as I can." (https://triathlon.mx/blogs/triathlon-news/gravel-burn-2025-how-alistair-brownlee-conquered-800km-of-south-africas-brutal-terrain-in-epic-7-day-cycling-adventure)

**Alistair Brownlee [ELITE]:** "What's more adventurous than riding 800 kilometres through the Karoo and the remotest parts of Africa? We've been in some proper remote places. It's been super adventurous and a lot of fun." (https://triathlon.mx/blogs/triathlon-news/gravel-burn-2025-how-alistair-brownlee-conquered-800km-of-south-africas-brutal-terrain-in-epic-7-day-cycling-adventure)

**Alistair Brownlee [ELITE]:** "It's incredible that we're standing in one of the camps now. And it's really impossible to explain the remoteness of some of the places we've been staying in. And still, there's this amazing infrastructure of 1,000 tents, incredible food in the Burn Camps, and places for people to hang out." (https://triathlon.mx/blogs/triathlon-news/gravel-burn-2025-how-alistair-brownlee-conquered-800km-of-south-africas-brutal-terrain-in-epic-7-day-cycling-adventure)

**Alistair Brownlee [ELITE]:** "Actually, I missed the most important thing, which is hot showers!!!" (https://triathlon.mx/blogs/triathlon-news/gravel-burn-2025-how-alistair-brownlee-conquered-800km-of-south-africas-brutal-terrain-in-epic-7-day-cycling-adventure)

**Alistair Brownlee [ELITE]:** "Really, I love riding my bike. I like racing. I like kinds of adventure and seeing the world, and I think gravel encompasses all of that." Finished 23rd out of 32 professional men and reflected: "one of the best events I've ever done" and that he's "already looking forward to the next one." (https://triathlon.mx/blogs/triathlon-news/gravel-burn-2025-how-alistair-brownlee-conquered-800km-of-south-africas-brutal-terrain-in-epic-7-day-cycling-adventure)

**Kevin Vermaak (Race Founder) [ELITE]:** "A seven-day gravel race in Africa is not the same as cruising the smooth 'gravel' roads of The Netherlands. While our routes avoid harsh corrugation, the environment is still demanding – even a little bit of suspension makes a big difference over a long week of riding." (https://gravel-burn.link/stories/prepare-for-race-week-expert-advice)

**Kevin Vermaak (Race Founder) [ELITE]:** "Honestly, Wade, the overwhelming feeling was relief. Relief that we could now move into an iterative phase of improvement. Before the event, we had a vision. We believed that riding gravel bikes over corrugated roads in the Karoo and moving camp every day would be fun, but until you do that first event, you don't actually know if it's going to work." (https://escapecollective.com/re-imagining-the-gravel-racing-experience-at-gravel-burn/)

**Kevin Vermaak [ELITE]:** "We had international riders dropping hundreds of positions on the final stage because they stopped to watch rhinos for half an hour. I love that." (https://escapecollective.com/re-imagining-the-gravel-racing-experience-at-gravel-burn/)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**[ELITE] - Tire Width:** 45mm tyre width recommended as "the sweet spot that balances compliance, gear, robustness and rolling resistance." Minimum of 42mm clearance. Tubeless setup is essential. Opt for a tyre model with extra protection. (https://gravel-burn.link/stories/prepare-for-race-week-expert-advice)

**[ELITE] - Gearing:** 40T front chainring paired with a 10-50T cassette found to be "more than adequate" during Trial Burn test rides. Stage 5 features a final 14km climb ramping up to gradients of well over 10% in the last 5km, requiring a bail-out gear. (https://gravel-burn.link/stories/prepare-for-race-week-expert-advice)

**[ELITE] - Suspension:** Full suspension recommended, or at least a front suspension solution. Aaron Borrill noted he "didn't expect as many corrugations and washboard surfaces, and would have probably looked at fitting wider tyres or a suspension fork in retrospect." (https://gravel-burn.link/stories/prepare-for-race-week-expert-advice and https://www.cyclingweekly.com/routes/gravel-burn-is-the-toughest-off-road-stage-race-in-the-world-and-this-is-why-it-needs-to-be-on-your-bucket-list)

**[ELITE] - Clothing for Weather:** Aaron Borrill: "My Castelli Gabba R long sleeve jersey worked a treat – it kept me dry and warm for the entire stage" during Stage 1's biblical rain. UK experience taught him to "prepare for all kinds of weather." (https://www.cyclingweekly.com/routes/gravel-burn-is-the-toughest-off-road-stage-race-in-the-world-and-this-is-why-it-needs-to-be-on-your-bucket-list)

**[ELITE] - Mechanical Preparedness:** Aaron Borrill emphasized needing to be "cool under pressure when things go wrong" and thinking carefully about "what equipment to carry, how quickly they can access puncture repair tools, and their ability to fix mechanical issues under pressure." He suffered a sidewall tear on Stage 3 requiring a completely new tyre at the next aid station. (https://www.cyclingweekly.com/routes/gravel-burn-is-the-toughest-off-road-stage-race-in-the-world-and-this-is-why-it-needs-to-be-on-your-bucket-list)

**[GENERAL]:** Riders used campfires to dry their clothes and shoes after Stage 1's drenching rain, but didn't expect sub-zero temperatures overnight that froze everything left outside. (https://www.cyclingweekly.com/routes/gravel-burn-is-the-toughest-off-road-stage-race-in-the-world-and-this-is-why-it-needs-to-be-on-your-bucket-list)

## Weather Experienced

**Stage 1 (2025):** "Biblical rain pouring down for 48 hours" leading up to the start. Rain didn't stop during the 83km/2,200m stage to Avontuur. "Slippery but achingly beautiful" conditions. (https://www.cyclingweekly.com/routes/gravel-burn-is-the-toughest-off-road-stage-race-in-the-world-and-this-is-why-it-needs-to-be-on-your-bucket-list)

**Night after Stage 1 (2025):** Sub-zero temperatures, with riders awakening to -3°C on the morning of Stage 2. Frost and ice on tents and bikes. Camp was at nearly 1,000m above sea level. (https://www.cyclingweekly.com/routes/gravel-burn-is-the-toughest-off-road-stage-race-in-the-world-and-this-is-why-it-needs-to-be-on-your-bucket-list)

**Stage 2 (2025):** Started at -3°C but by afternoon reached into the thirties – "a massive swing in temperature." Some wind but generally enjoyable. (https://www.cyclingweekly.com/routes/gravel-burn-is-the-toughest-off-road-stage-race-in-the-world-and-this-is-why-it-needs-to-be-on-your-bucket-list)

**Stage 5 (2025):** "Temperatures soaring, with temperatures well over 35 degrees recorded on the climb" up the 18km Swaershoek Pass. "It wasn't the gradient so much as the heat that made it super tough." (https://www.cyclingweekly.com/routes/gravel-burn-is-the-toughest-off-road-stage-race-in-the-world-and-this-is-why-it-needs-to-be-on-your-bucket-list)

**Night before Stage 6 (2025):** "A storm came in during the evening with strong, gale-force winds blowing down the nearby bergs into our campsite in Merino Farm at 1,300m above sea level. The wind blew savagely during the night, pummeling the camp and suckerpunching our tents without relenting." (https://www.cyclingweekly.com/routes/gravel-burn-is-the-toughest-off-road-stage-race-in-the-world-and-this-is-why-it-needs-to-be-on-your-bucket-list)

**Stage 6 (2025):** Wind reaching "dangerously close to 100km/h at times, eventually blowing down the dining marquees and ravaging the tented villages." Crosswind gusts "so severe that it required you to lean your entire body weight to the side to stay upright." "Super-strong winds, rain, heat, hailstones the size of marbles and then more rain and wind. All the weather in one day." Stage was neutralised due to dangerous conditions. Some riders were blown off their bikes; Andri Frischknecht suffered a broken collarbone and suspected concussion. (https://www.cyclingweekly.com/routes/gravel-burn-is-the-toughest-off-road-stage-race-in-the-world-and-this-is-why-it-needs-to-be-on-your-bucket-list)

**General October Expectations:** Average temperatures in October (high/low): Knysna: 24°C/14°C; Graaff Reinet: 29°C/10°C; Shamwari: 25°C/13°C. "Generally, temperatures vary between cool nights and hot days." (https://gravel-burn.link/stories/prepare-for-race-week-expert-advice)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Stage 1 - Prince Alfred Pass:** "At 13km long, it was challenging, but rewarding at the same time." Described as "extraordinary." Route featured "forest roads morphed into mountain passes and fast, flowing descents." Treacherous conditions when wet. (https://www.cyclingweekly.com/routes/gravel-burn-is-the-toughest-off-road-stage-race-in-the-world-and-this-is-why-it-needs-to-be-on-your-bucket-list and https://www.cyclingweekly.com/routes/gravel-burn-2025-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-gravel-stage-race)

**Stage 3:** "A mix of technical climbing, descending, and fast gravel" but also featured riders' "first taste of loose, rocky terrain, which mangled many wheels and destroyed tyres." (https://www.cyclingweekly.com/routes/gravel-burn-is-the-toughest-off-road-stage-race-in-the-world-and-this-is-why-it-needs-to-be-on-your-bucket-list and https://www.cyclingweekly.com/routes/gravel-burn-2025-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-gravel-stage-race)

**Stage 4:** 111km/1,500m featuring "the first taste of rough terrain that tested our mettle. Corrugations? Sure, that was standard, but the choppy, loose and rocky descents were hard on the body." First stage where Aaron Borrill experienced 'hot foot' (painful, burning and numbing pain under the ball of the foot caused by nerve compression). Described as "one or two rough sections" with "loose surfaces." (https://www.cyclingweekly.com/routes/gravel-burn-is-the-toughest-off-road-stage-race-in-the-world-and-this-is-why-it-needs-to-be-on-your-bucket-list and https://gravel-burn.link/stories/prepare-for-race-week-expert-advice)

**Stage 5:** "A race of two halves. The start served up 10km of gravel before 80km of smooth tarmac" which "provided some relief for our aching bodies." Then "a brutal section of gravel, where the racing officially kicked off." Final challenge: 18km climb up Swaershoek Pass. Followed by "a 4km neutral descent to the camp felt even harder; the bumpy surfaces and vibrations rattled me to the core. I barely had any strength left to grip the bars." (https://www.cyclingweekly.com/routes/gravel-burn-is-the-toughest-off-road-stage-race-in-the-world-and-this-is-why-it-needs-to-be-on-your-bucket-list and https://www.cyclingweekly.com/routes/gravel-burn-2025-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-gravel-stage-race)

**Stage 6:** "Mountain bike-like terrain and brutally long descents." Would have "shaken up the GC across all categories" if not neutralised. (https://www.cyclingweekly.com/routes/gravel-burn-is-the-toughest-off-road-stage-race-in-the-world-and-this-is-why-it-needs-to-be-on-your-bucket-list)

**Stage 7:** "Felt easier than stages 4, 5 and 6, but it was also faster with riders gassing it." Features African bushveld with Big Five wildlife sightings. (https://www.cyclingweekly.com/routes/gravel-burn-is-the-toughest-off-road-stage-race-in-the-world-and-this-is-why-it-needs-to-be-on-your-bucket-list)

**General Course Description:** "The route has a mix of wide gravel roads and narrower paths, descents and climbs and one or two rough sections. You'll find fast sections, loose surfaces and steep climbs." Not 'champagne gravel' - Aaron Borrill noted he "didn't expect as many corrugations and washboard surfaces." Race director warned: "A seven-day gravel race in Africa is not the same as cruising the smooth 'gravel' roads of The Netherlands." (https://gravel-burn.link/stories/prepare-for-race-week-expert-advice and https://www.cyclingweekly.com/routes/gravel-burn-is-the-toughest-off-road-stage-race-in-the-world-and-this-is-why-it-needs-to-be-on-your-bucket-list)

**Wildlife:** "Exotic animals were on display in the latter stages. This included sightings of rhino, giraffe, ostrich, zebra and antelope." Some riders "stopped to watch rhinos for half an hour" on the final stage. (https://www.cyclingweekly.com/routes/gravel-burn-is-the-toughest-off-road-stage-race-in-the-world-and-this-is-why-it-needs-to-be-on-your-bucket-list and https://escapecollective.com/re-imagining-the-gravel-racing-experience-at-gravel-burn/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**[ELITE] - Training Preparation:** Most experienced riders "dedicate at least 3 months of focused training for the event." For first-time stage racers, "it makes sense to start further out." Training should include: long rides (3h+ on gravel), tempo rides, higher-intensity interval training, bunch riding, sessions on mixed terrains, and rest days. During intense training blocks, aim to take in 60-90g of carbohydrates per hour to train the stomach for race-day intake. (https://gravel-burn.link/stories/prepare-for-race-week-expert-advice)

**[ELITE] - Stage 5 Pacing:** Aaron Borrill reported that "the sharp end of the racing age groupers made it hard, sending echelons across the road and splintering the group as we crested the first climb. This caused a split and a 20-30 man selection, which I managed to make." The racing "officially kicked off" after 80km of tarmac when hitting the brutal gravel section before the final climb. (https://www.cyclingweekly.com/routes/gravel-burn-is-the-toughest-off-road-stage-race-in-the-world-and-this-is-why-it-needs-to-be-on-your-bucket-list)

**[GENERAL] - Understanding the Course:** "Understanding what's in store each day is essential for effective pacing and energy management throughout the race." Weather "can play a major role in how each stage plays out, so be ready to adapt." (https://gravel-burn.link/stories/prepare-for-race-week-expert-advice)

**[GENERAL] - Race Nutrition:** "During each session, aim to take in 60-90g of carbohydrates per hour" during training to prepare the body. "Practice your race-day nutrition strategy during your training rides to ensure your stomach can tolerate the heavy influx of carbohydrates without any discomfort." Focus on "carbohydrate-rich meals maximises glycogen stores and keeps you energised and helps stave off fatigue." (https://gravel-burn.link/stories/prepare-for-race-week-expert-advice)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Mechanical Failures:** Stage 3 saw "many wheels" mangled and tyres destroyed on loose, rocky terrain. Peter Stetina destroyed his wheel and tyre after hitting a rock and rode on the rim for 10km. Aaron Borrill tore his sidewall and needed a completely new tyre at the next aid station. (https://www.cyclingweekly.com/routes/gravel-burn-is-the-toughest-off-road-stage-race-in-the-world-and-this-is-why-it-needs-to-be-on-your-bucket-list)

**Weather-Related DNFs:** Stage 6 was neutralised due to dangerous winds. "Some riders got blown off their bikes, others, including Andri Frischknecht, had a fall that culminated in a broken collarbone and a suspected concussion." The organisers decided to neutralise after determining conditions were too dangerous, with crosswind gusts requiring riders to "lean your entire body weight to the side to stay upright." (https://www.cyclingweekly.com/routes/gravel-burn-is-the-toughest-off-road-stage-race-in-the-world-and-this-is-why-it-needs-to-be-on-your-bucket-list)

**Cumulative Fatigue:** By Stage 4, Aaron Borrill began experiencing "hot foot" pain. By the end of Stage 5's descent after the mountain-top finish, he "barely had any strength left to grip the bars" due to "bumpy surfaces and vibrations." The "fatigue potential of gravel bikes on African gravel routes creating real issues from day four onwards." (https://www.cyclingweekly.com/routes/gravel-burn-is-the-toughest-off-road-stage-race-in-the-world-and-this-is-why-it-needs-to-be-on-your-bucket-list and https://road.cc/offroad/content/feature/2025-gravel-burn-stage-race-everything-you-need-to-know-15915)

**Sleep Deprivation:** Before Stage 6, riders faced a night where "strong, gale-force winds" pummeled the camp. "I'm not sure many riders managed any sleep that night; I know I didn't." (https://www.cyclingweekly.com/routes/gravel-burn-is-the-toughest-off-road-stage-race-in-the-world-and-this-is-why-it-needs-to-be-on-your-bucket-list)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Burn Camps:** Each evening, 500 participants gathered in "Burn Camps" - elaborate temporary settlements featuring "everything from bike mechanics and laundry services to Wi-Fi and hot showers." Alistair Brownlee marveled: "It's incredible that we're standing in one of the camps now. And it's really impossible to explain the remoteness of some of the places we've been staying in. And still, there's this amazing infrastructure of 1,000 tents, incredible food in the Burn Camps, and places for people to hang out." (https://triathlon.mx/blogs/triathlon-news/gravel-burn-2025-how-alistair-brownlee-conquered-800km-of-south-africas-brutal-terrain-in-epic-7-day-cycling-adventure and https://www.cyclingweekly.com/routes/gravel-burn-2025-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-gravel-stage-race)

**Social Design:** Camps used "scalable intimacy" concept with "Lapas" - "clusters of 20 or 30 tents in a circular formation around a campfire. You eat and share ablutions with that smaller group. It creates these intimate communities within the larger event." Kevin Vermaak: "I didn't want 1,000 riders in a massive dining marquee." (https://escapecollective.com/re-imagining-the-gravel-racing-experience-at-gravel-burn/)

**Evening Activities:** "Riders would gather around campfires, sharing stories of the day's challenges while mechanics worked on their bikes and support staff handled the washing. These weren't just practical necessities but community-building moments that enriched the entire experience." Riders dried their wet clothes and shoes using campfires. (https://triathlon.mx/blogs/triathlon-news/gravel-burn-2025-how-alistair-brownlee-conquered-800km-of-south-africas-brutal-terrain-in-epic-7-day-cycling-adventure and https://www.cyclingweekly.com/routes/gravel-burn-is-the-toughest-off-road-stage-race-in-the-world-and-this-is-why-it-needs-to-be-on-your-bucket-list)

**Pro-Am Atmosphere without Spectators:** Kevin Vermaak deliberately created a "no spectator" rule: "We crafted a finish line shot with zero spectators – just a single windmill, one oil drum with a sponsor logo, and the landscape. It allows the pros to relax. I saw Alistair Brownlee and Tom Pidcock having lunch, just chatting about the day, with no one bothering them for selfies. It creates a very different, very special atmosphere." (https://escapecollective.com/re-imagining-the-gravel-racing-experience-at-gravel-burn/)

**Solo Format Creating Community:** "With full-service luxury camps, excellent locally sourced food and beverages, and engaging evening activities, riders of all paces and focus will feel at home." One rider noted: "I felt like I knew 500 people by the end of the week" - contrasting with Cape Epic's two-person team format that "often keeps you in a bubble with your teammate." (https://escapecollective.com/re-imagining-the-gravel-racing-experience-at-gravel-burn/ and https://www.thenxrth.com/post/from-the-northwoods-to-south-africa-meet-the-world-s-newest-and-wildest-gravel-stage-race)

**Adventure over Competition:** Kevin Vermaak: "With Gravel Burn, maybe it has to do with the stage of life I'm in personally. I wanted seven days of adventure riding where I'm still competitive. I like to ride fast, but I wanted a more social experience." Riders "dropping hundreds of positions on the final stage because they stopped to watch rhinos for half an hour" exemplifies this ethos. (https://escapecollective.com/re-imagining-the-gravel-racing-experience-at-gravel-burn/)

**Night Burn Event:** Kevin Vermaak described the Night Burn as giving him "goosebumps" - "Tom Pidcock racing, doing jumps to overtake riders, laser shows, smoke machines in the middle of the desert." This was a "dream 20 years ago of racing bikes between bonfires at night" that finally came together. (https://escapecollective.com/re-imagining-the-gravel-racing-experience-at-gravel-burn/)
