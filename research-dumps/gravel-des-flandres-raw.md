# GRAVEL DES FLANDRES - RAW RESEARCH DUMP

## Status: Unable to Locate This Specific Race

Based on my search results, I cannot find a gravel race specifically called **"Gravel des Flandres"** with the characteristics you've described (65 miles, 3500 ft elevation in Flanders, Belgium).

## What I Found Instead

The search results returned several related gravel races in the Flanders/Charente regions, but none match your specified race:

**In Belgium (Flanders region):**
- **Flanders Gravel Kemmelberg** – A series of gravel events scheduled for 2026 including dates on 6/10, 6/30-7/2, 8/5, and 9/15-17[4]
- **Gravel Koppenberg** – Part of the Flanders Gravel series (6/30-7/2)[4]
- **Gravel Limburg** – Scheduled for 8/5/2026[4]
- **Durbuy Gravel** – Scheduled for 9/15-17/2026[4]

**In France (Charente region):**
- **Flandres Charentaises Classic Gravel** – The 15th edition in 2026 features gravel distances of 60km and 105km with start/finish in Champagne-Mouton[3]
- **Nord Charente Classic Gravel Tour** – Includes Saturday competitive gravel racing at 50km or 100km distances[2]

## Critical Issue

The "Gravel des Flandres" as you've described it does not appear in any current race calendars, official event listings, or gravel cycling databases in my search results. This could mean:

1. The race name may be slightly different
2. It may be a smaller/local event not widely indexed online
3. It may have been discontinued
4. The location or distance specifications may be different from what was provided

**To help you further, I would need:**
- The exact year this race occurs
- The organizing body or official website
- An alternative race name or organizer name
- Confirmation of the correct location (specific town in Belgium vs. France)

Could you verify the race name or provide additional details so I can conduct a more targeted search?
