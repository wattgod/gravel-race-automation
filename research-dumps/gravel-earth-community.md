# GRAVEL EARTH SERIES — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Pete Stetina [ELITE]:** "Coming into the series final, Ranxo (an hour west of Barcelona), I was sitting fourth overall but Ranxo is weighed much heavier than any other event, being the final and all. It was clear that whomever had a killer ride on the day could take top honors... The rolling fitness friendly farm roads were linked with singletrack connections and also cyclocross dismount moments. It was much rowdier than anyone expected." (https://thefeed.com/insider/race-roundups-with-pete-stetina-the-gravel-earth-series-final)

**Pete Stetina [ELITE]:** "The hardest climb of the day started at mile one, and I set the tempo from the gun using my climbing advantage to whittle the group. The Maurten Bicarb helped immensely given the intense start." (https://thefeed.com/insider/race-roundups-with-pete-stetina-the-gravel-earth-series-final)

**Pete Stetina [ELITE]:** "I was maintaining my goal of 120g of carbs/hour via a variety of my favorite The Feed offerings and as attrition took its toll I knew I needed to manage the race tactically... I came home for third on the day and found Griff already stinking of champagne. As hugs were exchanged I learned I'd only lept to third overall... I won't lie in that I felt a bit sour about that and also learning in some complex backward math that had I pipped Simen in the sprint the ENTIRE series would have been mine." (https://thefeed.com/insider/race-roundups-with-pete-stetina-the-gravel-earth-series-final)

**Jorge Padrones [ELITE]:** "Around km 80 I started to feel my rear tyre was losing pressure, so I decided to stop to put some air with my pump and to see if it was sealing. This meant I had to leave the group in which I was riding... Then I had to stop again and I had to be stopped for around 10 minutes trying to find the source of my tyre problem... I should give my thanks to the official mechanics BikeLand of Ponts, at the second feed station as thanks to them I could finish once they fixed the problem with my leaking valve." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-the-gravel-earth-series-final)

**Jorge Padrones [ELITE]:** "The final feed station was located more than two hours riding away from the previous feed one, so numbers and profiles do not always tell the truth... It was not only that, but the storms also somehow marked the competition day. There were areas of the course which previously were meant to be easy, but with the arrival of mud became more technical and added difficulty to the race." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-the-gravel-earth-series-final)

**Thomas (The Gravel Stack) [ELITE]:** "Famously, the 160 km Ranxo course starts almost immediately with the day's toughest climb, 5,4 km on gravel with an average gradient of 5.2% and some sections above 15%. In short, it's a selection point, and it comes right out of the gate... Less than 10 minutes into the race, in the middle of the climb, the field had already shattered. A group of less than 20 guys was in the front." (https://thegravelstack.substack.com/p/recapping-ranxo-and-the-2025-gravel)

**Thomas (The Gravel Stack) [ELITE]:** "Sadly, the decisive moment of the race is a crash. Mads bailed in a rather nasty manner after Wout took a wrong turn and caused Magnus to brake abruptly, causing a touch of wheels with Mads. Hans Becking waited and checked if Mads was okay before continuing his ride." (https://thegravelstack.substack.com/p/recapping-ranxo-and-the-2025-gravel)

**Lukas Baum [ELITE]:** "Lukas Baum expressed the previous day his intention to make the course in just 6 hours. That's 30 km/h average - pretty high expectations taking into account the mud and the heavy terrain from the previous days' rain that made it more difficult to roll. He was not very far off the mark - he stopped the clock on 6 hours 12 despite all these challenges and a flat tyre that he suffered." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-the-gravel-earth-series-final)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Diederick Deelen [ELITE]:** Raced with ENVE Mog equipped with Hutchinson Touareg tires. "He only got this bike after The Traka, and the tires are the only component that has varied since then. He started with Hutchinson Touareg 40 mm but lately, he is racing with 45 mm ones even in races that most people still ride with slim tires." Build includes mainly ENVE, SRAM, and Ceramic Speed components, with Garbaruk front ring. (https://rawcyclingmag.com/cardona-final-gravel-earth-series/)

**Daan Grosemans [ELITE]:** "His weapon of choice for the second part of the year has been a Ridley Kanzo Fast equipped with the Powershift system from Classified. He was riding with a 50-tooth front ring so the conversion factor of the system allowed him to ride with a virtual 34T front ring too. He and Piotr Havik, the current two members of the Classified team, mentioned the advantage they enjoyed in Cardona with the ability to shift gears under load whenever they came across an unexpectedly steep ramp." (https://rawcyclingmag.com/cardona-final-gravel-earth-series/)

**Annabel Fisher [ELITE]:** "She rides on gravel with a Lauf bike, so for some events she raced with the characteristic gravel suspension fork of the Icelandic bike brand. In Cardona she opted for a lightweight rigid version of the fork, though, and it proved to be key for her win." (https://rawcyclingmag.com/cardona-final-gravel-earth-series/)

**Janosch Wintermantel [ELITE]:** "His Scott Addict is already good-looking, but said that ahead of the gravel World Championships he will receive a new Scott model, switch to a x1 SRAM front ring, and put some Schwalbe 45 mm G-One RS on." (https://rawcyclingmag.com/cardona-final-gravel-earth-series/)

**Magnus Bak Klaris [ELITE]:** Noted racing with "Magnus' aero helmet and his open jersey flapping in the wind. I'm no Dan Bigham, but I assure you that this cost him some watts." (https://thegravelstack.substack.com/p/recapping-ranxo-and-the-2025-gravel)

## Weather Experienced

**2023 Ranxo Gravel:** "There were big storms in the area" on the Friday before the race, which caused the social ride to be cancelled. "There were areas of the course which previously were meant to be easy, but with the arrival of mud became more technical and added difficulty to the race." Mud from previous day's rain made the first section "very slippery." Despite this, "it was a hot day with temperatures in the 30s Celsius." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-the-gravel-earth-series-final)

**2026 Santa Vall:** Described as "a muddy edition of Santa Vall" (https://www.cyclingnews.com/gravel-earth-series/)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Ranxo Gravel Course:** "The 160 km Ranxo course starts almost immediately with the day's toughest climb, 5,4 km on gravel with an average gradient of 5.2% and some sections above 15%." Total elevation: 180km with 3,400m climbing, with "more than 1500 meters climbing still to be covered" after km 110. "Half of the elevation gain was concentrated in just the 60 final km, so the script was saying this would be an elimination and survival race." (https://thegravelstack.substack.com/p/recapping-ranxo-and-the-2025-gravel)

**Ranxo Terrain Character:** "The rolling fitness friendly farm roads were linked with singletrack connections and also cyclocross dismount moments. It was much rowdier than anyone expected." Photos make it look like "endless rolling terrain similar to midwest American gravel, but once recon was finished, it was anything but." Course included "rocky sections and technical trails." (https://thefeed.com/insider/race-roundups-with-pete-stetina-the-gravel-earth-series-final)

**Course Selection:** "The early parts [of the first climb] are very steep at around 15% and there are only two viable lines. If you are too far back, you can lose the race right there." After 10 minutes into the race, "the field had already shattered." The course became "more straightforward" by halfway, allowing groups to settle. (https://thegravelstack.substack.com/p/recapping-ranxo-and-the-2025-gravel)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Pete Stetina [ELITE]:** "The hardest climb of the day started at mile one, and I set the tempo from the gun using my climbing advantage to whittle the group... I was maintaining my goal of 120g of carbs/hour via a variety of my favorite The Feed offerings." Used tactical racing: "The right move had to come at the right time, not just with the legs but equally with the head. I was heavily marked, and some Europeans were playing team tactics. With 20k to go I went all in on the final climb with fellow American and Canyon-sponsored rider Griffin Easter." (https://thefeed.com/insider/race-roundups-with-pete-stetina-the-gravel-earth-series-final)

**Elite Race Dynamics [ELITE level]:** "One minute into the race, and the field is already broken into pieces... When the men started, we got all the action, including a fair bit of jostling for position leading into the first climb. The start was properly hard. Good on anyone who did get a decent warm-up in... everyone with a stake in the race's outcome (and Paul Sandmann 😅) is already there or thereabout." (https://thegravelstack.substack.com/p/recapping-ranxo-and-the-2025-gravel)

**Feed Station Strategy:** "There's no hiding the fact" that riders need to plan for feed stations carefully. "In the days before the event, we were discussing a feed station that was located at just 17 km before the finish line, when almost all the rest was downhill. We saw it kind of useless, but in reality, it saved our lives. I arrived there with no water at all... The final feed station was located more than two hours riding away from the previous feed one." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-the-gravel-earth-series-final)

**Timing Expectations [ELITE level]:** Top riders were "flying over the course. Lukas Baum expressed the previous day his intention to make the course in just 6 hours. That's 30 km/h average" - he finished in 6:12 despite mud and a flat. Women's winner Rosa Klöser finished in 5:29:41 for 160km. (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-the-gravel-earth-series-final)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Tire/Mechanical Issues:** Multiple riders experienced flats and tire problems. Jorge Padrones: "Around km 80 I started to feel my rear tyre was losing pressure... I had to be stopped for around 10 minutes trying to find the source of my tyre problem." Lukas Baum suffered "a flat tyre" but still won. Elite rider Mads Würtz Schmidt crashed and "was forced to abandon." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-the-gravel-earth-series-final)

**Early Selection Risk:** "The early parts [of the first climb] are very steep at around 15% and there are only two viable lines. If you are too far back, you can lose the race right there. Less than 10 minutes into the race, in the middle of the climb, the field had already shattered." Race fragmentation happened very early, with "how big the gaps were already" by km 90, with Jorge noting he "had to be stopped for around 10 minutes" and "no other group passed" after that. (https://thegravelstack.substack.com/p/recapping-ranxo-and-the-2025-gravel)

**Crashes:** "Sadly, the decisive moment of the race is a crash. Mads bailed in a rather nasty manner after Wout took a wrong turn and caused Magnus to brake abruptly, causing a touch of wheels with Mads." Karolina Migon also "crashed" during the women's race. (https://thegravelstack.substack.com/p/recapping-ranxo-and-the-2025-gravel)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Post-Race Atmosphere:** "After the race, we could enjoy a nice meal and some relaxation and also an after party. This is something we really love about this type of gravel event. They are not just pure competition, but there is a nice atmosphere after the race and you can chat and share your experiences with other riders, making new friends with a common passion." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-the-gravel-earth-series-final)

**Venue & Setup:** "The venue of the final was El Vilar de la Duquesa, a hotel resort located in the upper part of the medieval village. Most riders had spent the previous night there... All the action happened in a resort completely taken over by the race, so there was an exhibition, events area and chill zone. In a way there was a gravel ambience all around and you could speak to fellow riders from the previous day or after the race." (https://rawcyclingmag.com/cardona-final-gravel-earth-series/)

**Series Community Vibe:** "We could feel a family vibe, as we were surrounded by people that have spent a big part of the year racing against each other, which in the end has the ability to forge friendships." At the prize ceremony around 18:30, "with a beer in hand, the trophies and medals of the Gravel Earth Series were handed." (https://rawcyclingmag.com/cardona-final-gravel-earth-series/)

**Sportsmanship:** Hans Becking demonstrated remarkable sportsmanship when "Mads bailed in a rather nasty manner... Hans Becking waited and checked if Mads was okay before continuing his ride." (https://thegravelstack.substack.com/p/recapping-ranxo-and-the-2025-gravel)

**Series Philosophy:** "At Gravel Earth Series, we've joined forces with the most renowned Gravel events worldwide to create a unique experience. We not only uphold the highest standards of Gravel racing but also offer cyclists the chance to explore the most stunning landscapes on Earth while connecting with local cultures and traditions. Each race is a full immersion not just in nature, but in the communities that welcome us." The series motto: "No nature, no future." (https://gravelearthseries.com/)

**Organization Quality:** "This format of individual races that form part of a league are a real boon for those who can join several events around the globe. The whole series had spotless organisation by Klassmark, the organisers of The Traka and Ranxo and they have all the experience to organise these races to perfection end to end." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-the-gravel-earth-series-final)

**Live Coverage:** "Thanks to the good people at Klassmark (the company running the series), we did get to see all of the action live in their YouTube stream." The series produces documentary content with episodes titled "Start of the Season," "Beyond the Grit," "Monument of Fire," and "The Last Dance." (https://thegravelstack.substack.com/p/recapping-ranxo-and-the-2025-gravel)

## Series Structure & Controversy

**2026 Calendar Changes:** The series underwent significant restructuring for 2026, reducing from 25 races to 12 events. "Downsizing the series was the right call. The 2025 calendar was bloated: 25 races, little coherence, and no clear storyline. Cutting it down to 12 gives it room to breathe." Age-group racing was introduced. (https://www.joelaverick.com/p/gravel-earth-2026-a-series-of-unfortunate)

**Scheduling Controversy:** "Ranxo, a race that's gained a reputation as the GES finale and beloved for its proximity to Girona, has been moved to the week after Unbound. The week after Unbound?! Erm, why? Unbound is the Tour de France of gravel... Holding a race in the backyard of most riders just eight days after the 200-mile Kansas event is, frankly, ridiculous." One week after Ranxo, Lost and Found is scheduled in California. (https://www.joelaverick.com/p/gravel-earth-2026-a-series-of-unfortunate)

**Iceland Controversy:** "As if losing The Rift wasn't enough, the creation of Cuckoo Gravel - a Klassmark event in Iceland - has left a sour taste in a lot of mouths. It's scheduled just two weeks before The Rift and, from what's been shared, appears to take place in a similar region and on a similar course... reportedly, The Rift organiser only found out about this new race in the past few weeks." (https://www.joelaverick.com/p/gravel-earth-2026-a-series-of-unfortunate)

**Rider Reactions to 2026:** "Within minutes of posting my thoughts about the calendar, I had a large percentage of the GES Top 10 in my DMs. The sentiment was near-unanimous: disappointment... These latest moves seem corporate and calculated." One pro stated: "I feel like we are going to see Life Time eat Gravel Earth Series' lunch as the wealth gap increases." Life Time announced a $590,000 prize pot for 2026. (https://www.joelaverick.com/p/gravel-earth-2026-a-series-of-unfortunate)

## Notable Results & Achievements

**Rosa Klöser's Dominance [ELITE]:** "Rosa Klöser is the runaway winner of the Gravel Earth Series, thanks to an impressive run in the second half of the season. Starting with her win at The Rift, she ended up going 4/4 with further victories at Core4, Gravel Worlds, and Ranxo. In the entire season, she didn't finish any GES race in a spot worse than 3rd... She won two Monuments of Gravel in the process as well, namely The Rift and Gravel Worlds." (https://thegravelstack.substack.com/p/recapping-ranxo-and-the-2025-gravel)

**Magnus Bak Klaris Pathway [ELITE]:** "Magnus Bak Klaris started racing gravel professionally this year... he hardly finished a gravel race outside the top 10 (Unbound being the notable exception). In short, Magnus went from a total unknown to a high-level contender within one season... I expect to see similar stories in the future, especially in Europe. We have a lot of high-caliber cycling talent that doesn't quite make it into the WorldTour. Some of those young lads (and gals!) will look at gravel as a viable pathway to building a career as a pro cyclist. We shall henceforth call this the Bak Klaris Pathway." (https://thegravelstack.substack.com/p/recapping-ranxo-and-the-2025-gravel)

**Griffin Easter's Breakthrough [ELITE]:** At Ranxo, "on the descent he opened up a small gap. At the bottom the others stalled and I bluffed, 'He's my friend and Canyon homie' I said as I sat on and refused to turn through. If they brought him back I'd have fresher legs to counter-attack for the victory. They hesitated and Griff's gap opened up. He committed to an all out time trial and soloed to the biggest win of his career... Griffin's win vaulted him all the way from ninth to second" overall.
