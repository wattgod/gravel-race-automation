# UCI GRAVEL SUISSE / THE MAJESTICS — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Tessa Neefjes [ELITE]:** "I really love this race. The environment is beautiful. Racing through the Galloway Forest Park in Scotland is incredible, and the atmosphere around the start and finish is so welcoming... The separate women's start is something I really appreciate. We can truly race our own race, battle with each other and think tactically about how we want to ride. That doesn't happen at every UCI event, and it makes a big difference."

**Note:** This quote is about The Gralloch, which Tessa mentioned as one of her favorite races, providing context for understanding elite UCI gravel racing priorities.

**Tessa Neefjes [ELITE]:** On winning The Gralloch after a collarbone break: "My season started in March with a UCI race in Belgium, but I crashed and broke my collarbone in that first race. I needed surgery and then six weeks with no racing at all... All the other riders already had some racing in their legs. For me, there was a big question mark. It was my first race of the season... That made it really special. After the setback, after all the work on my own, to come back with no race pace and then win… it felt like a proper comeback."

**Carolin Schiff [ELITE]:** On joining Canyon x DT Swiss All-Terrain Racing: "It's an honour to be in one of the first all-terrain teams. 2025 was hard for me with injury and body problems so my goal is to be healthy and find my rhythm this season. I'm thankful that Canyon supported me throughout and never pushed me – that's not normal in professional sport."

**Jasper Ockeloen [ELITE]:** "I always like to be at the front of the change instead of following. We have a big advantage with this professional structure. Unbound is one of the biggest goals of the team, and as a team there we have a big advantage. We can play tactics and work together. That excites me." (https://www.inkl.com/news/former-unbound-gravel-winner-carolin-schiff-returns-from-health-issues-with-new-13-rider-canyon-x-dt-swiss-all-terrain-racing-team)

**Rosa Klöser [ELITE]:** After winning Alentejo Gravel: "The race was basically mixed with age group men, the start was quite hilly and technical so I found myself in a group of 15-20 men already after 15km. I decided to use the race as good training and raced the men - in the end, I finished in the top 5 overall in the age group men and won women elite - not bad to round off the season! Good to get some speed in the legs, battle it out with the boys but will focus on battling the ladies separately in 2026."

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**The Majestics/UCI Gravel Suisse 2026 Course Details:**

From race description: The Granfondo course (150km) features "the first 42 kilometers will follow the same routes as the Mediofondo. But make sure to keep your feet firmly on the pedals to tackle the 150 km and 3,800 m elevation gain. In Saanen, you'll embark on the climb to Mittelberg, which sits at an impressive 1,679 meters above sea level! You'll then have a long period of respite all the way to Gruyères with a 30 km descent... Plus, you'll enjoy views of the Gruyère d'En-Haut Regional Park." (https://www.finishers.com/en/event/uci-gran-fondo-suisse-time-trial)

The Mediofondo (97km, 2600mD+): "Starting in Villars-sur-Ollon, you'll head up the Col de la Croix before descending to the Diablerets. But don't get too comfortable on the downhill, as you'll need to put in some serious effort to climb up to the Col du Pillon! Take a breather as you race down to Château d'Oex. But don't celebrate too soon, as three ascents await you... The Col des Mosses, Lécherette, Mosses, Forclaz... and finally climbing back up to the Col de la Croix! This final ascent might really test your limits with its 8% average gradient." (https://www.finishers.com/en/event/uci-gran-fondo-suisse-time-trial)

The Summit gravel route (100km): Takes place "at the doorsteps of the UCI headquarters in Aigle... first 10km on flat paved roads towards the town of Ollon where riders encounter the first 5km offroad climb @10% average before passing back via Ollon after 20km to stay in the Rhone valley until km 50 where the real climbing begins. The second part of the course is in woods and mostly offroad and goes in different steps from the valley towards the finish line on the Col de la Croix near the Skistation of Les Mazots." (https://ucigravelworldseries.com/en/villars/)

**Tessa Neefjes [ELITE]** on The Gralloch terrain (similar UCI gravel series race): "I really love the final gravel downhill before the finish. It's technical, fast, and then you drop down towards the line. Those kinds of downhills are my favourite... This is pure gravel. You're really in nature, with no traffic, proper gravel climbs and technical descents." (https://www.grallochgravel.com/journal/tessa-neefjes-on-defending-her-gralloch-crown-belief-gravel-and-coming-back-stronger)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Tessa Neefjes [ELITE]:** "I like to arrive early and do proper recons. I study the climbs, the downhills, the gravel and the lines. I want to know where time can be gained and where attacks might happen. That preparation is really important... If you know the course, you know where the top of the climb is. You know it's just one more minute. That really helps in hard moments." (https://www.grallochgravel.com/journal/tessa-neefjes-on-defending-her-gralloch-crown-belief-gravel-and-coming-back-stronger)

**Tessa Neefjes [ELITE]** on fuel management: "It's constantly up and down, and it can be easy to forget to drink and eat enough. Train your fuelling so you still feel strong at the finish." (https://www.grallochgravel.com/journal/tessa-neefjes-on-defending-her-gralloch-crown-belief-gravel-and-coming-back-stronger)

**Tessa Neefjes [ELITE]** on mental approach: "I always try to enjoy the environment and trust myself. Even when there are hard moments, believing in it can really make a difference... I have the word 'belief' on my helmet, my jewellery and my bike. When things are hard, it reminds me why I keep going." (https://www.grallochgravel.com/journal/tessa-neefjes-on-defending-her-gralloch-crown-belief-gravel-and-coming-back-stronger)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Gran Fondo Cycling Magazine 2025 Gravel Bike Test [ELITE perspective]:** Testing conducted in Nice on the Côte d'Azur on "white gravel roads, winding climbs with sea-view, technical descents through pine forests, loose rock sections and flowing high-speed stretches... Steep ramps tested their climbing prowess, tight corners their handling, fast descents their composure. Flat sections demanded aero efficiency, rolling terrain called for rhythm." The test emphasized: "What counts is speed – and the bike that came out on top in the widest range of riding scenarios secures the crown as the best gravel race bike of 2025." (https://granfondo-cycling.com/best-race-gravel-bike-review/)

**Gran Fondo Cycling Magazine [ELITE racing context]:** Key bike criteria for gravel racing: "Precise, direct steering is like the ideal wingman: calm, reliable, and always there when things get dicey... The perfect setup finds that sweet spot: nimble when it matters, but calm in its core... Weight matters, of course. So do wheels and tires. But the real difference lies in the torsional stiffness of the frame, fork and cockpit." (https://granfondo-cycling.com/best-race-gravel-bike-review/)

**Canyon x DT Swiss All-Terrain Racing Team [ELITE]:** "Riders for Canyon × DT Swiss ATR will compete on a range of different Canyon Factory Racing bikes, equipped with Shimano components, depending on the demands of the terrain and discipline being raced. They will use DT Swiss wheels but also have options for specific suspension forks, the F 132 ONE, specifically developed with Canyon for the use on the Grail CFR."

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Tessa Neefjes [ELITE]** on UCI gravel racing atmosphere: "After the race, you can talk with amateur riders. You've all ridden the same course, so you can really share the experience... For me, that connection is a big part of what makes gravel racing so unique." (https://www.grallochgravel.com/journal/tessa-neefjes-on-defending-her-gralloch-crown-belief-gravel-and-coming-back-stronger)

**Tessa Neefjes [ELITE]** on The Gralloch (representative UCI gravel event): "It feels like a festival before and after the race. The start area is really nice, the people are kind, and everything just comes together... You finish and there are happy people everywhere. You can sit on the grass, eat, drink, relax. It feels like a celebration, and that makes the experience really special." (https://www.grallochgravel.com/journal/tessa-neefjes-on-defending-her-gralloch-crown-belief-gravel-and-coming-back-stronger)

**Gran Fondo Cycling Magazine [industry perspective]:** On the evolution of gravel racing: "Ever since the launch of the UCI Gravel World Championships, and with the rise of events like Unbound and The Traka, one thing's become clear: this is full-on racing, with all the trimmings. Aero skinsuits, top-tier kit, feed zones that feel more like F1 paddocks – and right in the thick of it, the world's best riders, squeezing gravel races in between spring classics and Grand Tours." (https://granfondo-cycling.com/best-race-gravel-bike-review/)

**Canyon x DT Swiss All-Terrain Racing philosophy [ELITE team]:** Team member Jasper Ockeloen: "I like it when things get unexpected..." Team describes themselves as "13 riders. Five nationalities. Different backgrounds, disciplines, surfaces, and definitions of performance. The Wildcards come together as a team to share experience and knowledge across terrains and racing backgrounds, shaping a new blueprint for modern performance. Race everything." (https://www.canyon.com/en-us/meet-the-wildcards-all-terrain-racing/b16022026.html)
