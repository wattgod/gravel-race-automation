## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Ted King [COMPETITIVE]:** "Heat, crashes & team tactics—Ted King takes on Gravel Locos 2025. With scorching heat, a stacked international field, and a race course filled with punchy climbs and high-speed descents, this year's edition was anything but easy... Despite the heat and exploding legs, he rallies late in the race and finishes strong in a highly competitive international field." (https://kavhelmets.com/blogs/kav-journal/battling-heat-and-international-field-at-2025-gravel-locos)

**Justine Barrow [ELITE]:** "Stoked to take my first win in the US at Gravel Locos, was hands down the hottest race I've ever done—nothing like I've experienced before. It was a mass start, but I ended up in a group with my teammates, and we worked hard to keep the pace high and hold the gap. I was feeling strong toward the end, so I pushed to thin out the group… and ended up riding the last 40 km solo. Such a great event—and the perfect tune-up for Unbound Gravel." (https://www.cyclingnews.com/races/gravel-locos-2025/gl-110-elite-women-and-men/results/)

**Marisa Boaz [ELITE]:** "There's no better way to describe Gravel Locos than the photo above." [Context: after finishing second in 2024, having gotten turned around when the lead vehicle made a wrong turn and caught up in crashes] (https://www.renehersecycles.com/gravel-locos-in-texas-and-holly-in-colorado/)

**Kevin 'Benky' Benkenstein [COMPETITIVE]:** "We turned approximately 7,000 corners. 2,500 m in 250 km is a lot of climbing when it's all short, steep kickers—American gravel racing is hard! I can't say enough about the route, the vibe, the people, and the experience of Gravel Locos, though. If you're ever in with the chance to be here, make it work. The race is amazing and Hico is rad, too. The cookout last night in town was an awesome experience after a hard day." (https://www.renehersecycles.com/gravel-locos-in-texas-and-holly-in-colorado/)

**Brennan Wertz [ELITE]:** "It rained overnight, so the roads were pretty soft and moist for the first few hours. When the sun came out and things dried out, I was flying. The cornering traction was also amazing. Best I've felt cornering in a race like that—ever!" (https://www.renehersecycles.com/gravel-locos-in-texas-and-holly-in-colorado/)

**Jonas Orset [ELITE]:** "I feel like I'm dancing on the pedals. I think to myself. I feel incredible—probably the best I've felt all year... I feel like a roasted chicken, sizzling on a grill. The sun beats down mercilessly, and I'm not sure how much longer I can endure it... We both brake hard and plunge into the water, submerging ourselves completely. The cold shock is immediate, a lifeline in this furnace... Taking a dip has rarely felt so good. We don't linger, but it's enough to cool me down just enough to feel alive again. As we roll back onto the gravel, I feel incredible—like I've been baptized and born anew. Suddenly, I can push 50 watts more without thinking." (https://nordictrailblazer.cc/races/gravel-locos-25/)

**Fred_wonder_chicken [RECREATIONAL]:** "Last year I rode the Unbound Gravel 100 which was my first gravel race. I had a blast and knew I wanted to ride another long race this year... I entered this race with one goal - finish - which I did. Since the start of the year, I've ridden 3900 miles, the most I've ever ridden in such a short period... I dialed in my nutrition during my training rides, and I had zero problems finishing the race. No bonk and no cramps. I felt strong up to and including the last hill leading to the finish line." (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/13rwtj5/gravel_locos_go_ride_this_race/)

**Anonymous Reddit user [RECREATIONAL]:** "Completed my first century at Gravel Locos this weekend. Not bad for a guy that tipped the scale at 276 pounds 3 years ago. I got my fueling right by honestly left some pace behind because I was terrified to bonk having never ridden this far before." (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/13nr3g7/completed_my_first_century_at_gravel_locos_this/)

I run Schwalbe G-One R 45mm on my front wheel and RS 40 mm on my rear. The added width gives me great control." [Note: This appears to reference two different setups from different years] (https://nordictrailblazer.cc/races/gravel-locos-2/ and https://nordictrailblazer.cc/races/gravel-locos-25/)

**Jonas Orset [ELITE] on hydration setup:** "I have three bottles on my bike and a Camelback with two liters of water" for the 150-mile course (https://nordictrailblazer.cc/races/gravel-locos-2/)

## Weather Experienced

**2024 Race:** Temperatures hovered around 91°F/33°C according to race reports (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/gravel-locos-2024-results/)

**2025 Race:** Described as "scorching heat" with "the hottest race" conditions by winner Justine Barrow (https://www.cyclingnews.com/races/gravel-locos-2025/gl-110-elite-women-and-men/results/)

**2025 Race (Jonas Orset's experience) [ELITE]:** "As we reach mile 35 it's 33ºC and temperature is rising... My Bryton says it's close to 40ºC... At around 23ºC, it's actually quite comfortable" [referring to water temperature at river crossing]. Also noted: "It rained overnight, so the roads were pretty soft and moist for the first few hours" (https://nordictrailblazer.cc/races/gravel-locos-25/)

**2023 Race:** Jonas Orset noted "It's a chilly morning, about 15˚C, but it will be hotter" at the start (https://nordictrailblazer.cc/races/gravel-locos-2/)

**Weather variability:** One rider noted "Due to heavy showers last night, it's not dusty, but somewhere it's a little soggy, and there are also a few puddles" (https://nordictrailblazer.cc/races/gravel-locos-2/)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Course characterization:** "The gravel here is solid and fast" but with variability—"A few miles later, we hit some steep kickers. I remember them from last year—200 meters with about 15% average." (https://nordictrailblazer.cc/races/gravel-locos-2/)

**The "Three B's" climbs:** Described as "notorious" and a key feature of the course. Jonas Orset: "Bam—we hit the first of three kickers. I drop to my lowest gear and pedal as hard as I can, but the bike barely moves. Cadence sits at 40." The map calls one section "Norway Hill" (https://nordictrailblazer.cc/races/gravel-locos-25/ and https://kavhelmets.com/blogs/kav-journal/battling-heat-and-international-field-at-2025-gravel-locos)

**River crossings:** Multiple sources mention an "iconic river crossing" that's a signature feature. Jonas Orset: "Splash. It doesn't take many miles from the start before my clean, new Felt Carbon Advanced is soaked with water and caked in mud after smashing through the first river crossing... Hundreds of riders are charging through the same crossing, sending shockwaves through the water." Later: "like a miracle, an oasis appears: a river crossing. Without a word, we both brake hard and plunge into the water, submerging ourselves completely." (https://nordictrailblazer.cc/races/gravel-locos-25/)

**Course adjustments 2024:** "Riders found out the day before the race that the courses were being adjusted due to unsafe river crossings. The marquee race, 'La Loca,' was adjusted to 147.3 miles with 6,285 feet of climbing." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/gravel-locos-2024-results/)

**Technical challenge:** Kevin Benkenstein noted "We turned approximately 7,000 corners" emphasizing the technical, constantly-turning nature of Texas gravel (https://www.renehersecycles.com/gravel-locos-in-texas-and-holly-in-colorado/)

**Landscape:** "The Texan prairie is green and pretty. The flowers are blooming. I'm flying across the fields... The stretches are getting longer, and the distance between farms is increasing. There are some cattle out here. There are also some eagles watching us from above." (https://nordictrailblazer.cc/races/gravel-locos-2/)

**Wildlife encounters:** Jonas Orset reported: "Whoa! I maneuver to the gravel road's other side as a snake is in my lane... two angry dogs are waiting for us. They start chasing us, and I accelerate. Soon the dogs are focusing on the rider behind me, and I hear him screaming in pain as he makes his cramping legs sprint to get away from the dogs. Welcome to the Wild West." (https://nordictrailblazer.cc/races/gravel-locos-2/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Elite breakaway timing [ELITE perspective]:** In 2024, Julien Gagne "made a bold solo move from a group of 10 with 60 miles to go" and held it to the finish, winning by 3 minutes (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/gravel-locos-2024-results/)

**Elite women's race dynamics [ELITE]:** Justine Barrow in 2024 "found herself separated from the rest of the women's field 15 miles into the race and didn't see any of her competitors until they crossed the finish line." Marisa Boaz rode solo from mile 70 to a second-place finish. (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/gravel-locos-2024-results/)

**Mandatory feed zone strategy [ELITE]:** Jonas Orset: "Gravel Locos has two mandatory stops where you have to pause for two minutes... With close to 20 riders together, it quickly gets a bit chaotic... some riders are already rolling out. Stress kicks in as I scramble to close my bottle and chase after them. Gravel Locos has always been a gentleman's race, where riders respected the feed zones and waited their turn—this rush feels disappointing." (https://nordictrailblazer.cc/races/gravel-locos-25/)

**Heat management critical [ELITE perspective]:** Jonas Orset: "At the last mandatory aid station, a big bag of ice is stuffed down my back, keeping me chilled for nearly the next hour—an icy shield against the relentless heat." He also described submerging in river crossings as life-saving: "For a moment, everything slows—the heat, the race, the pain... As we roll back onto the gravel, I feel incredible—like I've been baptized and born anew. Suddenly, I can push 50 watts more without thinking." (https://nordictrailblazer.cc/races/gravel-locos-25/)

**Recreational pacing wisdom [RECREATIONAL]:** "I got my fueling right by honestly left some pace behind because I was terrified to bonk having never ridden this far before. Can't wait for my next one!" (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/13nr3g7/completed_my_first_century_at_gravel_locos_this/)

**Nutrition success [RECREATIONAL]:** "I dialed in my nutrition during my training rides, and I had zero problems finishing the race. No bonk and no cramps. I felt strong up to and including the last hill leading to the finish line." This rider had completed 3,900 miles of training since the start of the year. (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/13rwtj5/gravel_locos_go_ride_this_race/)

**Team tactics emerging:** Ted King noted "the evolving dynamics of modern gravel racing" and "how team tactics are shaping today's gravel scene" (https://kavhelmets.com/blogs/kav-journal/battling-heat-and-international-field-at-2025-gravel-locos)

**Elite early race dynamics [ELITE]:** Jonas Orset described getting an unintentional early break: "I have gotten a good gap, unintentionally... I decide to get into my TT position and ride steadily. Strong but steady. 300w. The gap increases... Soon I have 30-45 sec on the rest of the peloton... It might be more of a TV breakaway than something that sticks, but I feel good and ride hard yet comfortably." Was caught at mile 25. (https://nordictrailblazer.cc/races/gravel-locos-2/)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Mechanicals:** Jonas Orset experienced a flat tire at mile 30: "I realize my rear tire is flat... I still lose about 30-45 sec and must start chasing the group." Later had to stop at an aid station for a tube change, losing contact with the lead group. Other elite riders including Nicolas Roche and Innokenty Zavyalov also suffered punctures. (https://nordictrailblazer.cc/races/gravel-locos-2/)

**Heat-related failures:** Jonas Orset described the critical moment: "I feel like a roasted chicken, sizzling on a grill. The sun beats down mercilessly, and I'm not sure how much longer I can endure it... a growing doubt creeps in—I might have to stop in the shade just to survive." He noted this was "where I bonked in the heat last year. It took me from the 11th to the 17th." (https://nordictrailblazer.cc/races/gravel-locos-25/)

**Navigation issues in 2024:** "Marisa Boaz, who won the race in 2022, was actually in the same group early on but got turned around and caught up in a few crashes when the lead vehicle made a wrong turn." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/gravel-locos-2024-results/)

**GPS failure risk:** Jonas Orset: "There are no signs in Gravel Locos, so you need to follow your GPS unit. But what if it stops working? I had that fear yesterday as I packed my stuff for the race. Finally, I accepted the added weight and carried a spare unit... My head unit is frozen!" He had to swap to his backup unit mid-race. (https://nordictrailblazer.cc/races/gravel-locos-2/)

**The 3B's climbs as breaking point:** Multiple riders noted losing contact with groups on these steep kickers. Jonas Orset: "I drop to my lowest gear and pedal as hard as I can, but the bike barely moves. Cadence sits at 40... I lose a few meters at the top... as soon as we hit the second hill, I start to struggle. The group pulls away." (https://nordictrailblazer.cc/races/gravel-locos-25/)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Welcoming to all levels:** "The race attracts riders of all skill levels, from seasoned pros to casual cyclists, all eager to experience the thrill of racing on gravel roads. With a focus on community and adventure, Gravel Locos emphasizes the importance of camaraderie among participants." (https://www.xjd.com/t-gravel-locos-bike-race/)

**Post-race experience:** Kevin Benkenstein: "The cookout last night in town was an awesome experience after a hard day." (https://www.renehersecycles.com/gravel-locos-in-texas-and-holly-in-colorado/)

**Race charity component:** "The race has been raising money for Hico Volunteer Fire Department, funding a new truck and a firehouse in Hico. The risk of grass fire is significant here, so his and his team's effort can be life-saving. Racing for a cause gives the event another dimension which I love." Also: "Thanks to Gravel Locos, the department has received a renovated firehouse, a new command truck, a Can-Am, summer fire suits, and much more." (https://nordictrailblazer.cc/races/gravel-locos-2/ and https://visithicotexas.com/gravel-locos-2025/)

**Race founder's involvement:** "Fabian gets up on his pickup truck and starts to talk into the mic. He is the race's promoter and has done a great job putting it together. In just three years, he made the event from scratch, from a small event in central Texas to one of the most prestigious in the country." (https://nordictrailblazer.cc/races/gravel-locos-2/)

**International flavor:** "The Gravel Spirit is very much alive in Hico. On the same streets where Billy the Kid once walked nearly 150 years ago, the gunfights may be history—but the energy remains." The race now attracts "a stacked international field" with "half of the top 20 men and women hailing from outside of the United States" in 2024. (https://nordictrailblazer.cc/races/gravel-locos-25/ and https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/gravel-locos-2024-results/)

**Dutch vs. Quebec rivalry:** "After the race, there was some friendly banter on social media between Laurens ten Dam, self-appointed leader of the 'Dutch Mafia' of gravel racing, and the 'Poutine Mafia,' which includes Québécois riders Gagne, Roberge, and Cartier. It turns out that Quebec and the Netherlands have gone head to head in every edition of Gravel Locos." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/gravel-locos-2024-results/)

**Town character:** "Hico is the claimed home of the legend Billy the Kid, a well-known outlaw... For such a small town, Hico has plenty of big flavors to offer when it comes to food. From delicious Mexican food to fresh farm to table cuisine, traditional Italian to handcrafted sandwiches, there are great restaurants to please any palate." (https://nordictrailblazer.cc/races/gravel-locos-2/ and https://visithicotexas.com/gravel-locos-2025/)

**Weekend event structure:** "The event typically spans over a weekend, with activities planned for both days. The first day often includes registration, pre-race briefings, and social events, while the race itself takes place on the second day. This schedule fosters a sense of community among participants." Schedule includes Friday pre-ride with pros, Friday packet pickup, and Saturday race with post-race meal prepared by Hico Volunteer Fire Department. (https://www.xjd.com/t-gravel-locos-bike-race/ and https://visithicotexas.com/gravel-locos-2025/)

**Rapid growth and prestige:** "Gravel Locos is quickly establishing itself as one of the big races on the calendar. This year's field included the who-is-who of gravel racers" and is "a now world-renowned gravel race in the small Texas town of Hico." The race got "stamped on the gravel map in 2021 when it debuted with a star studded start list." (https://www.renehersecycles.com/gravel-locos-in-texas-and-holly-in-colorado/ and https://kavhelmets.com/blogs/kav-journal/battling-heat-and-international-field-at-2025-gravel-locos)

**Pre-Unbound positioning:** Described as "the perfect tune-up for Unbound Gravel" with "most of the international talent arriving in the US ahead of Gravel Locos for a pre-Unbound shakeout." (https://www.cyclingnews.com/races/gravel-locos-2025/gl-110-elite-women-and-men/results/ and https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/gravel-locos-2024-results/)
