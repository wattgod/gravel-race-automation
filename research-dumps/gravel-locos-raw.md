## **TERRAIN & COURSE**
**Surface Breakdown:**
* **Speed:** This is a *fast* course. The gravel is predominantly "hard-packed" and smooth dirt. It is not the tire-shredding flint of Kansas.
* **River Crossings:** A signature feature. There are multiple low-water crossings. Some are rideable concrete slabs with algae (slick!), others are deep creek beds that require dismounting.
* **Climbing:** It is not flat. It is "Texas Hill Country." Expect short, punchy, steep rollers with grades hitting **20%**.
* **Technicality:** Low. Aside from the water crossings and a few sandy patches, it is technically easy, favoring roadies and power riders.

## **WEATHER & HEAT**
**The X-Factor:** The heat in Hico in late May can be dangerous.
* **2024:** Described by winner Karolina Migoń as "hands down the hottest race I’ve ever done."
* **2022:** A "hell" year where temps read 120°F (49°C) off the tarmac. Riders reported aid stations running out of water.
* **2023:** A "lucky" year with pleasant temps and wildflowers.
* **Preparation:** You must train for heat. Hydration packs are strongly recommended over just bottles.

## **REDDIT THREADS**
**Thread:** "Gravel Locos: Go ride this race"
* **Quote:** "Fast gravel roads... The fresh tarmac read like 120° on my wahoo at some points AND they ran out of water... Waited over 30 minutes at that aid station."

* **Men's Winner:** Ramon Sinkeldam (Former WorldTour pro)
* **Women's Winner:** Karolina Migoń (PAS Racing)
* **2nd Place Women:** Emily Newsom (Nearly 15 mins back)
* **Takeaway:** This race attracts serious international talent (PAS Racing, Dutch pros) using it as an Unbound tune-up. The gaps can be massive due to the heat attrition.

There is very little shade.         |
| The Water Crossings                                                                                      | Technical/Physical                                                                                       | Slick algae can cause crashes. Walking through deep water with wet socks leads to blisters in the heat.  |
| Steep Rollers                                                                                            | Physical                                                                                                 | Short 15-20% kicks that require high torque, often when your legs are already cramping from dehydration. |



## **EQUIPMENT CONSENSUS**
* **Tires:** **38mm - 42mm**.
	* *Type:* **Fast rolling / Slick Center.** (e.g., Specialized Pathfinder Pro, Pirelli Cinturato H). Knobs are unnecessary and slow on the hardpack.
	* *Official Advice:* "The 700x47c was... overkill." - <u>[Gravel Locos Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/gravellocos/posts/what-tire-do-you-recommend-thats-the-question-we-get-asked-the-most-for-the-may-/296991055792928/)</u>**Hydration:** **Wear a pack (CamelBak/USWE).** Two bottles are likely insufficient for the distances between aid stations in Texas heat.
* **Shoes:** Consider MTB shoes that drain well due to the river crossings.
## **LOGISTICS**
* **Airports:****Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW):** ~2 hours drive.
	* **Austin (AUS):** ~2.5 hours drive.
	* **Waco (ACT):** ~1 hour (Regional).
* **Lodging:** Hico is a tiny town.
	* *Options:* Hico Upstairs Inn (often booked), Midland Hotel.
	* *Strategy:* Most riders stay in **Stephenville** (20 mins away) or **Glen Rose** (30 mins away) where chain hotels exist.
* **Dining:** Hico has great BBQ and the famous "Koffee Kup" pie shop.
