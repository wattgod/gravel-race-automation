## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Course profile:** "The course is pan flat" with "hard-packed dirt roads quickly change into challenging grass sections, old gravel roads will put every rider to the test with potholes always lurking. Single-tracks are avoided, almost all of the route will be wide enough to make for an open race. Aero is everything!" (https://ucigravelworldseries.com/en/roden/)

**Surface mix:** According to the official site, the route uses "a mix of dirt roads, gravel roads and grass sections" connecting "most of the stunning and diverse cycling sites in the area" through "plains, forest and a rural area." (https://ucigravelworldseries.com/en/roden/)

**Spectator-friendly:** "The course is also interesting for spectators as it winds through a few villages in a network of smaller roads and loops often close to each other so easy to make shortcuts for spectators to watch the riders on different locations." (https://ucigravelworldseries.com/en/roden/)

**2025 specific conditions:** The fast, flat terrain allowed the men's elite race to average over 36 km/h overall with the front group of ~20 riders staying together despite many breakaway attempts. (https://www.progravelmagazine.com/post/sun-speed-and-gravel-2025-gravel-one-fifty-race-report)
