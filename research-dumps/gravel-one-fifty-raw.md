## ADDITIONAL NOTES

The search results provide solid **official race data** (dates, fees, distances, UCI status, location) for both the 2025 and 2026 editions.

Additional targeted searches would be needed to compile information on:

- Participant reviews and forum discussions
- Lodging and travel logistics
- Historical weather data for July and April in Drenthe

The user's known info (93 miles / 150 km matches; 800 ft elevation is unconfirmed) aligns with the 150 km distance option for competitive riders.
