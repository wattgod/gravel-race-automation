## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Course Characteristics:**
The event takes place on the exclusive Duncombe Park Estate in North York Moors National Park, featuring private landscape normally closed to the public. The terrain includes "world-class off-road riding, with an adventurous mix of pristine gravel and flowing singletrack" as well as "pristine paths, and breathtaking vistas." (https://focalevents.eventrac.co.uk/e/gravel-rocks-9208, https://www.timeoutdoors.com/events/gravel-rocks-running/gravel-riding-weekend)

**Course Profile:**
Listed as "Undulating" terrain with mixed trails combining gravel roads and singletrack sections (https://www.timeoutdoors.com/events/gravel-rocks-running/gravel-riding-weekend, https://focalevents.eventrac.co.uk/e/gravel-rocks-9208)

**Course Access:**
"Much of the event route is on private land within Duncombe Park Estate. It is important that there is no cycling prior to or after the event." (https://www.timeoutdoors.com/events/gravel-rocks-running/gravel-riding-weekend)

**Community Forum Perspective [UNKNOWN]:**
From Singletrack World forum discussion, one user noted they were "Looking at the racing collective i thought the Oxduro event had a great route. Varied and with some challenges" when discussing similar gravel events, suggesting riders value technical variety. Another forum participant mentioned **DaveyBoyWonder [UNKNOWN]:** "Gravel Rocks near Helmsley - no idea of the formats etc but heard its good." (https://singletrackworld.com/forum/bike-forum/find-me-a-gravel-or-maybe-road-mtb-event-for-2026/)

**Related Regional Terrain Context [UNKNOWN]:**
From a forum discussion about a similar event in the North York Moors, **hardtailonly [UNKNOWN]** noted: "The North Yorks Moors 300 would fit the bill...Lots of it is gravel - bike suitable, but NYM gravel can be pretty chunky! There's a few nice/challenging bits of singletrack too, plus some hike-a-bike. I did it on a rigid Ti HT with fast 2.2/2.3 tyres, but wish I'd had a suspension fork. I'd personally not choose my gravel bike as you'd be battered by the end of it." This suggests North York Moors gravel can be challenging terrain.

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Event Philosophy:**
The event is designed for both racing and social participation. "Not racing? No problem – come for the trails, the camaraderie, and the festival atmosphere." The format allows riders to "Choose to race or just enjoy riding...some of the best trails around Duncombe Park Estate."

**Multi-Sport Community:**
A unique aspect is the integration of trail runners and gravel riders: "Whether you are a runner or a rider the event brings together both communities to share a passion for adventure." The 2026 expansion added trail running categories with SCOTT Sports UK as title sponsor. As organizer Neil Atkinson explained: "The lines between gravel riders, trail runners and those who class themselves as outdoor adventurers across both sports are becoming evermore blurred, so with this expanded format at Gravel Rocks we're looking to welcome both runners and riders in a friendly atmosphere celebrating the best of both disciplines." (https://gravelrocks.cc/, https://news.paceupmedia.com/trail-runners--gravel-riders-unite-at-scott-gravel-rocks)

Full weekend camping is included in entry fees (not for Saturday-only entries). "Campervans, roof tents, caravans and tents are all welcome at no extra cost." Optional upgraded accommodation available in "Gravel Rocks Teepee Village" with carpeting, bedding, lighting, and beds. (https://www.timeoutdoors.com/events/gravel-rocks-running/gravel-riding-weekend)

**Forum Participant Perspective [UNKNOWN]:**
From Singletrack World forum, **qtip [UNKNOWN]** was seeking events with specific criteria including "Suits solo riding or riding in small groups - I'm not a fan of riding in a pack, especially off road...My ideal event would be a long distance gravel time trial...So a course that results in people being split up early on is ideal. Not too big - for the same reasons...and because I'm an autistic weirdo who doesn't like really big events and crowds of people." This rider was considering Gravel Rocks among other options, suggesting it might suit riders who prefer less crowded events.
