# GRAVEL ROLL - PECAN SHAKER — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Race Format & Key Details

The Pecan Shaker uses a **timed-segment format** rather than traditional point-to-point racing. According to the official site, "Each of our courses between one to four timed race segments and the race results are based on each racer's total time completing these segments. Rather than just racing from point A to B, take advantage of being able to ride our gravel bike races with friends of different fitness and skill levels, relax at fully stocked Gravel Roll aid stations, and pause for pictures along the scenic routes." (https://gravelroll.com/)

**Key Change:** The race moved from fall to spring in 2024. **Samson Large [ELITE]** noted: "Pecan Shaker 2024 was a bit different than it was in past years. After always having the event in the fall, due to scheduling conflicts and the addittion of two new locations we had to move Pecan Shaker to the spring." (https://gravelroll.com/gravel-roll-blog/pecanshaker24recap)

**Available distances:** 41, 72, and 106 miles (https://www.granfondoguide.com/Events/Index/10569/pecan-shaker)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

The course features extreme surface variety. Official description: "you'll speed past pecan groves and through fish hatcheries, private timberlands, watermelon, sunflower and peanut fields and over a wide variety of surface conditions. Similar to the terrain on our Bird Dog 100 course, you'll encounter Georgia red clay, red dirt, white kaolin, loam, dust over crust, and of course....the loose stuff!" (https://www.granfondoguide.com/Events/Index/10569/pecan-shaker)

Difficulty rating: **"Difficult terrain with longer, steeper hills"** (https://www.granfondoguide.com/Events/Index/10569/pecan-shaker)

## Weather Experienced

**2024:** Pre-race rain created challenging conditions. **Samson Large [ELITE]:** "Pecan Shaker 2024 wasn't without tragedy, as we did have quite the rain before raceday, making for soggy conditions on certain areas of the course." (https://gravelroll.com/gravel-roll-blog/pecanshaker24recap)

The spring date means different conditions than the traditional fall event.

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**NOTE:** No specific tire or equipment recommendations found from riders who completed Pecan Shaker specifically. However, related insights from the Dirty Pecan 150 (a different but geographically similar event) may be relevant:

**Team Gravel Cyclist [UNKNOWN level]** used 40mm+ tires for a 150-mile Florida dirt road event featuring similar Georgia red clay conditions: "The web site promised that conditions were superb and that skilled riders would 'do fine' on 28 or 30 tires but we knew better. Team Gravel Cyclist rocked 40mm wide tires and up." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/ride-report-dirty-pecan-150-mile-dirt-road-epic-what-were-we-thinking-by-k-dogg/)

**CAUTION:** This advice is from a different event and rider level unknown. Surface conditions at Pecan Shaker may vary.

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**K-Dogg [UNKNOWN level]** learned nutrition lessons the hard way on a 150-mile dirt road ride: "Mrs. K-Dogg (a scientifical person) advised me to 'consume 200 kcal/hour or a big lunch or suffer the consequences.'" He later noted: "I remembered my Double Espresso Gu and Ibuprofen… and began to feel better and better." Eventually: "With five miles to go I drifted off the back on one particularly long hill. A black curtain began to lower as an extreme bonk set in" (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/ride-report-dirty-pecan-150-mile-dirt-road-epic-what-were-we-thinking-by-k-dogg/)

**NOTE:** This is from a 150-mile event, not Pecan Shaker's shorter distances. Rider level unknown, so caloric needs may not apply to all riders.

## DNF Risk Factors

**Samson Large [ELITE]** mentioned: "with the exception of one gentleman who was promptly attended to by medical staff" in 2024, indicating at least one medical incident requiring attention. (https://gravelroll.com/gravel-roll-blog/pecan shaker24recap)

**Safety emphasis:** "Remember folks, we are here to have some fun and ride bikes, but your safety while on course is always our #1 priority!" (https://gravelroll.com/gravel-roll-blog/pecan shaker24recap)
