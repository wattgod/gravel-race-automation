# GRAVEL ROUBAIX — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Kari [UNKNOWN]:** "This race is not for the faint of heart. With 71 miles and over 7,800 ft. of elevation gain, it will test your legs and your capacity for suffering. I'm convinced there isn't a single stretch of flat on the Colonel Drake route until you hop on the bike path in the last mile." (https://www.ohiogravelgrinders.com/blog/2023/5/28/recap-roughneck-gravel-roubaix)

**Kari [UNKNOWN]:** "Around mile 18, I noticed it was loose again but I didn't want to lose any more time and I thought I'd be able to make it to the aid station. I was wrong. Within the next mile, in the middle of a steep climb, it came completely off the frame and swung down in between my crank arm and the frame... I threw my bottle in my back pocket, hand tightened the cage back on, and hoped for the best." (https://www.ohiogravelgrinders.com/blog/2023/5/28/recap-roughneck-gravel-roubaix)

**Kari [UNKNOWN]:** "I did not have a single negative car or dog interaction on this whole route - a rarity even on the best of routes! All of the roads were dry and dusty; many were flat pack and fast with some pretty bumpy and loose sections." (https://www.ohiogravelgrinders.com/blog/2023/5/28/recap-roughneck-gravel-roubaix)

**Ray [UNKNOWN]:** "The gravel roads were all dry, fast and super dusty. We did encounter some sections recently graded with some scatter gravel on top. Our route featured three major climbs (my Garmin said 13 total climbs) with one dropping us down into the valley and skirting the town of West Hickory before climbing almost 4 miles." (https://www.ohiogravelgrinders.com/blog/2023/5/28/recap-roughneck-gravel-roubaix)

**Anthony Grinnell [COMPETITIVE]:** Finished first in The Colonel Drake Metric Century 100-kilometer race at the 2024 edition with over 100 cyclists competing. (https://www.venangoextra.com/roughneck-gravel-roubaix-attracts-about-400-cyclists)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Elevation Profile:** The Colonel Drake (71-75 mile) route features over 7,800 ft of elevation gain with virtually no flat sections until the final mile on the bike path. The 40-mile Ironworks route had 13 total climbs according to GPS data. (https://www.ohiogravelgrinders.com/blog/2023/5/28/recap-roughneck-gravel-roubaix)

**Climb Specifics:** "Epic climbs that virtually start in the Allegheny River and traverse six miles to the summit." Routes feature one major descent dropping into the valley near West Hickory, followed by a nearly 4-mile climb back out. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/training-rides/all-about-the-roughneck-gravel-roubaix-titusville-pennsylvania/)

**Road Surfaces:** Dry, fast, and dusty conditions reported in 2023. Mix of flat pack fast sections with bumpy and loose areas. Some recently graded sections with scatter gravel on top. Otto Rd (mile 33 on longer routes) described as "a somewhat rutted and rocky jeep road in the middle of the forest." (https://www.ohiogravelgrinders.com/blog/2023/5/28/recap-roughneck-gravel-roubaix)

**Gravel Coverage:** All routes except the 13-mile route boast 95% gravel. Routes traverse some of the nearly 2,200 miles of public gravel roads across four counties. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/training-rides/all-about-the-roughneck-gravel-roubaix-titusville-pennsylvania/)

**Unique Finish:** "All 2023 routes finish by descending Drake Well Road and crossing the National Historic Landmark Jersey Bridge before navigating to the Drake Well BMX track. Yes, that is right! As if racing in the city where oil was first drilled isn't enough, cyclists get to finish their epic day on a dirt BMX track where local races are held all summer long." The BMX track "proved to be quite the challenge for some at the end of a long ride." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/training-rides/all-about-the-roughneck-gravel-roubaix-titusville-pennsylvania/)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Mechanical Issues:** Bottle cage mounting failures reported on climbs. Rider had bottle cage bolt strip mid-race around mile 18, requiring roadside zip-tie repair at aid station to continue. "I didn't trust it to stay on any longer. I threw my bottle in my back pocket, hand tightened the cage back on, and hoped for the best." (https://www.ohiogravelgrinders.com/blog/2023/5/28/recap-roughneck-gravel-roubaix)

**Physical Demands:** Multiple riders observed "feeling the climbs" at the second aid station (mile 33 on 40-mile route, mile 52+ on 70-mile route). The relentless climbing with virtually no flat recovery sections creates cumulative fatigue. (https://www.ohiogravelgrinders.com/blog/2023/5/28/recap-roughneck-gravel-roubaix)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Local Support:** "There were residents standing outside their homes cheering for us which was really neat. All day on course there were locals out cheering and offering water or snacks. I've never experienced that at an event before." In 2022, "over 5 aid stations set up by residents" in addition to official aid stations. (https://www.ohiogravelgrinders.com/blog/2023/5/28/recap-roughneck-gravel-roubaix)

**Aid Stations:** "Cyclists at last year's event called them formula one pit stops, with volunteers grabbing your bike, filling your bottles, handing you food and sending you on your way." Three different local bike shops represented at three aid stations providing mechanical support. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/training-rides/all-about-the-roughneck-gravel-roubaix-titusville-pennsylvania/)

**Police Escort:** "A police escort led the group south out of town and then an immediate climb that turned into gravel halfway up. Locals cheered us on as we passed." (https://www.ohiogravelgrinders.com/blog/2023/5/28/recap-roughneck-gravel-roubaix)

**Venue:** "The Titusville Ironworks Tap House serves as the start, registration, and after party venue. This unique venue has been fully restored and let's just say you won't be disappointed about the journey through local history as walk through the venue!" Post-race podiums and festivities held at Iron Works with live streaming and interviews. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/training-rides/all-about-the-roughneck-gravel-roubaix-titusville-pennsylvania/)

**Growth:** Event has seen rapid expansion: approximately 150 participants in 2022, 260-300 in 2023, and about 400 cyclists in 2024. (https://www.venangoextra.com/roughneck-gravel-roubaix-attracts-about-400-cyclists)

**Accommodations:** Lodging options include the unique Caboose Motel "comprised of 21 caboose cars converted into private rooms" located a block from event space, and Oil Creek Family Campground about 10 minutes south of town. (https://www.ohiogravelgrinders.com/blog/2023/5/28/recap-roughneck-gravel-roubaix)

**Historical Context:** Routes pass historical landmarks including the longest continuously producing oil well in the world (McClintock Well), Drake Well Museum and Park, and Historic Pithole City (a boom-and-bust oil town that once had 15,000 residents, now a ghost town with aid station at mile 13).

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Women's Pre-Ride [UNKNOWN]:** Friday ladies shakeout ride previewed first two climbs on a 13-mile loop, but "after the first climb and descent, we decided to take the bike path back to the venue and rest our legs because with non-stop climbs like that, race day would be no joke!" (https://www.ohiogravelgrinders.com/blog/2023/5/28/recap-roughneck-gravel-roubaix)

**Pack Dynamics:** "The pack broke up pretty quickly after the start of the first climb" on the Colonel Drake route starting at 8:00am. (https://www.ohiogravelgrinders.com/blog/2023/5/28/recap-roughneck-gravel-roubaix)
