## RACE HISTORY

### Barry-Roubaix Origins

**Founding:** 2009 in Barry County, Michigan

**Origin Story:**
- Traces back to group rides leaving Founders Brewing's original Monroe Street location circa 2005
- In 2007, Tim Curtis suggested doing a route in Barry County
- 2008: Tim Curtis invited Scott TenCate and racing team members to explore Barry County gravel roads
- Rick Plight, a team member and race promoter, joined Curtis on the ride
- First race: March 28, 2009 with 274 racers at Long Lake Outdoor Center, Middleville, MI
- Perfect conditions that day: cool and sunny

**Growth Timeline:**
- 2009: 274 racers (inaugural)
- 2010: 673 racers; moved to Gun Lake beach area at Yankee Springs Recreation Area
- 2014: Classified as "world's largest gravel road race" with 3,000+ participants
- Present: 4,000+ cyclists annually
- Named to Global Cycling Network's Top Five Gravel Events
- Named one of Nine Coolest Races of 2018

**The Name:** Selected via naming competition; direct reference to Paris-Roubaix

### Paris-Roubaix Heritage (The Original "Hell of the North")

**Founded:** 1896 - one of the oldest organized races in the world

**Founders:** Theodore Vienne and Maurice Perez (Roubaix textile manufacturers)
- Built a velodrome prior to the race
- Wanted to promote Roubaix, then a small mining town
- Henri Desgrange (future Tour de France founder) signed up but DNF'd at start

**First Race:** April 19, 1896
- 280km distance
- 51 competitors
- Start: 5:30 AM
- Winner: Josef Fischer (Germany) - finished in just over 9 hours
- Course: dirt roads, rutted/potholed tracks, 50km of cobbles

**"Hell of the North" Name Origin:**
NOT from difficult terrain - but from WWI devastation. After 1919 resumption, champion Henri Pelissier described: "We entered the heart of the battlefield. There was not a tree, everything was razed to the ground. Not a square meter of land was not turned over. There were craters on the ground... This is hell! This is not a race. This is a pilgrimage."

**The Cobblestones (Pavé) Challenge:**
- Post-war, many cobbled farm roads were tarmacked over
- Since 1960s, organizers draw increasingly sinuous paths to find remaining pavé
- Currently 50km of rough, "almost unrideable" pavé terrain

**Traditions:**
- Finish at Roubaix Velodrome (since 1936)
- Famous open showers with brass plaques commemorating winners
- Winners receive cobblestone brick trophy (since 1977)

## BLACK PILL

### The Brutal Truths About Gravel Roubaix Racing

**1. You Will Go Slower Than You Think**
If you average 15-16 mph on hilly road rides, expect 12-14 mph on gravel with similar elevation. Tougher terrain (mud, loose gravel, sand) = even slower.

**2. Going Out Too Hard is Almost Universal**
"The biggest mistake almost EVERY racer makes, even pros, is going out too hard." Conservative pacing is key for finishing strong.

**3. Road Fitness is NOT Enough**
Road fitness alone won't prepare you. You need at least one gravel/mixed surface ride per week to develop specific skills and muscle memory.

**4. Your Body Will Fail in Unexpected Ways**
- Chamois cream only on "normal" problem areas = raw nethers
- Exhaustion, dehydration, hypothermia, heat stroke make crashes more likely
- Brain injuries from oblique blows (MIPS helmets help)

**5. Equipment Failures Are Common**
- Bent derailleur hanger = most common catastrophic failure
- Broken chain = "virtually impossible to recover from in a race"
- Broken chain often causes: bent derailleurs, jammed cranks, wheel damage

**6. DNF is Real**
- Barry-Roubaix provides sweep vehicles but "may be several minutes" before pickup
- Must text bib number if you drop out
- Cannot use finish chute if you shorten your race

**7. Michigan April Weather is Brutal**
- Snow and ice are possible
- Freezing rain has happened
- 29°F with 20mph winds is documented
- Course may be altered last-minute due to conditions

**8. Sand Can Ruin Your Day**
Sager Road's sand section is a make-or-break moment. Wrong tires = walking.

**9. The Hills Never Stop**
- 62-mile: ~3,800-4,000 feet of climbing
- 100-mile: 7,000+ feet of climbing
- "Constantly changing gears"
- Three Sisters, The Wall, and countless others

**10. Crashes Happen on Flat Turns**
Common crash scenario: marble-sized loose gravel over hard gravel, front wheel washes out, rider goes down quickly to their side.

**11. Support is Limited**
- Long stretches (10-20 miles) without aid stations
- Must carry own repair tools
- "They will not be carrying a full assortment of repair items"

**12. 100-Mile Has Strict Cut-offs**
- Mile 41 by 11:30 AM
- Mile 62 by 1:15 PM
- Mile 88 by 4:00 PM
- ~10 mph average enforced

**13. Registration Sells Out FAST**
- 2026 Barry-Roubaix: ALREADY SOLD OUT
- 100-mile: sold out in "just a few days"
- Must be ready the moment registration opens

**14. No Outside Support on Course (100-miler)**
- No crews allowed
- Can only receive help from other registered riders or event personnel

## FINAL NOTES

The "Gravel Roubaix" concept represents American gravel racing's tribute to the legendary Paris-Roubaix. While no American gravel race features the actual pavé (cobblestones) of the French original, these events capture the spirit of early-season suffering, unpredictable conditions, and tests of both human and machine.

Barry-Roubaix stands as the flagship event - a true grassroots success story that grew from 274 riders in 2009 to become the world's largest gravel race. Its combination of April Michigan weather chaos, punishing climbs like the Three Sisters and The Wall, and the notorious Sager Road two-track create a uniquely challenging experience.

For those seeking the Roubaix experience outside Michigan, Rouge Roubaix offers Deep South grit with Louisiana cobblestone, while Ruby Roubaix provides stunning Nevada scenery in a more accessible fondo format.

**Bottom Line:** If you want to call yourself a serious gravel racer, Barry-Roubaix belongs on your bucket list. Just be ready to suffer - and bring the right tires.
