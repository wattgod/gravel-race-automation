## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Sophie Wright [ELITE]:** "I dream of days like this...today, it became reality. UCI World Series win. Feeling good as hell!!!" (https://www.cyclingnews.com/races/uci-gravel-world-series-events-2025/gravel-suisse/results/)

**Sophie Wright [ELITE]:** "Winning Gravel Swiss... my first UCI World series win!! I didn't expect to win a UCI race in my first year as a pro gravel racer, so when I caught the girl who was leading in the final 20km, I had so much motivation and adrenaline to absolutely empty myself all the way to the finish line, and ended up taking the victory by over 7minutes! My Dad was there too which made it extra special." (https://lecol.cc/en-us/blogs/content/ribble-outliers-gravel-season-recap)

**Sophie Wright [ELITE]:** "The final climb at Traka. It was really steep, and I'd made a move a few kilometres before to make my way into the top 10, and I really wanted to hold onto a top 10 finish so didn't want to be caught. I rode so hard up that final climb, in the heat, after 7 hours of racing, so fatigued, and I just remember it being so tough mentally and physically!!" (https://lecol.cc/en-us/blogs/content/ribble-outliers-gravel-season-recap)

**Harry [ELITE - Ribble Outliers]:** "Toughest moment on the bike this year? Probably unbound, falling off, puncturing and eventually stopping in the race mid way in. Had been a long 6 month build with no break, tank was empty." (https://lecol.cc/en-us/blogs/content/ribble-outliers-gravel-season-recap)

**Ben [ELITE - Ribble Outliers]:** "Missing out on the podium at Gralloch after being out front for so long with Peter Vakoc, then being caught in final kilometres and sprinting for the win in a group of four." (https://lecol.cc/en-us/blogs/content/ribble-outliers-gravel-season-recap)

**Meth [ELITE - Ribble Outliers team staff]:** "The surprise of Sophie getting the team's first UCI win. She rolled around the corner at the top of a mountain at Gravel Suisse, saying 'I've bloody won.'" (https://lecol.cc/en-us/blogs/content/ribble-outliers-gravel-season-recap)
