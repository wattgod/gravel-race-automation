# GRAVEL UNRAVEL - BON JON PASS OUT — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Ted King [ELITE]:** "I think it was approaching two hours for me to spin up the climb, topping off a bit shy of 4,000 feet, all the way from sea level. That was a straightforward challenge, and I knew the climb would shake up the group just a few minutes into the race. It did: We had a strong quartet up the first hour long climb towards Bon Jon Pass, then Mark Laughery pulled the two of us clear over the summit." (https://www.renehersecycles.com/ted-kings-impressions-from-bon-jon-pass/)

**Ted King [ELITE]:** "The gravel roads were in really good condition over the top, but then we entered a rough double-track section around mile 25 that required you to really pay attention. It was a 4×4 track that started pretty tame, but then presented plenty of challenges over the next nearly three rough miles. Rain throughout the weekend made that section sloppy and slippery, with plenty of whoops and dips. Despite some cold fingers at this point of the race—which isn't the best for bike dexterity and fast braking or shifting—that double-track section was really hard to beat for fun." (https://www.renehersecycles.com/ted-kings-impressions-from-bon-jon-pass/)

**Ted King [ELITE]:** "The screaming fast descents had wheel-eating potholes which would end your day badly if you weren't paying close attention. All the more difficult with mud splattering up from your front tire at high speeds." (https://www.renehersecycles.com/ted-kings-impressions-from-bon-jon-pass/)

**Jan Heine [COMPETITIVE]:** "I made it up Bon Jon Pass twice, and didn't pass out... I'd been up Bon Jon Pass a few times, but the race took us on some side tracks that even I didn't know. It was hard—as second half of the name suggests—and it was fun." (https://www.renehersecycles.com/rene-herse-x-gravel-unravel-races/)

**Jan Heine [COMPETITIVE]:** "There was just the right combination of professional organization and down-to-earth vibe. It felt like racing way back, when cycling was a tiny sport, and you just assumed that anybody showing up was a friend, or would become one." (https://www.renehersecycles.com/rene-herse-x-gravel-unravel-races/)

**Peninsula Daily News report [ELITE race coverage]:** "Amazingly, despite the length of the long course, that race actually came down to a near-photo finish. Tyler Klansnic of Lake Forest Park won with a time of 4 hours, 54 minutes and 34 seconds. Just two seconds behind him at 4:54:36 was Ben Shauland of Seattle."

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Ted King [ELITE] - Tire choice:** "I often wonder if people get tired of my pre-race videos breaking down my bike for the event because I rarely make any changes! Having recently come from these races across the plains of middle America, I was excited to swap in the knobbies and went with the 44 wide Manastash Ridge. Running Rene Herse tires, of course this means when choosing tires I'm going either for knobbies or for slicks, and the former imply it's a more exciting course. 44 is about as wide as I can fit in my frame, and it's a very confident tire, especially on the lengthier, high-speed descents." (https://www.renehersecycles.com/ted-kings-impressions-from-bon-jon-pass/)

**Ted King [ELITE] - Bike setup:** Rode a Cannondale Supersix EVO SE with 700×44 Manastash Ridge tires. (https://www.renehersecycles.com/ted-kings-impressions-from-bon-jon-pass/)

**Ted King [ELITE] - Clothing strategy:** "I think the next-biggest challenge was just what to wear for the day. It's all well and good to be damp and get some sprinkles down at sea level, but when you're up at 4,000 feet and in an entirely different climate, you really need to be prepared for the elements. So with a questionable forecast for the day, with a sky simultaneously scattered with bright sunshine and dark rainclouds, it was a tough day to dress just right." (https://www.renehersecycles.com/ted-kings-impressions-from-bon-jon-pass/)

## Weather Experienced

**2024 race conditions:** "Despite the weather—showers and even sleet all day—a lot of fun was had by all." Rain throughout the weekend made sections sloppy and slippery. Cold conditions at elevation caused "cold fingers" that affected bike handling. (https://www.renehersecycles.com/ted-kings-impressions-from-bon-jon-pass/)

**2025 race conditions:** "Conditions were good in this year's race, though cyclists did have to ride through cloud and fog at high elevations." (https://www.peninsuladailynews.com/sports/gravel-unravel-big-hills-thick-clouds-and-close-finishes/)

**Historical context:** "It wasn't as muddy as some past years, but the mountains were just as big and grueling... In past years, some of the races have been held in deluges and in one year, it was held in the middle of the worst heat wave in the Pacific Northwest in 100 years." (https://www.peninsuladailynews.com/sports/gravel-unravel-big-hills-thick-clouds-and-close-finishes/)

**Course note [UNKNOWN]:** "In 2024, the Long Course was shortened due to severe weather and was 55 miles rather than 80." (https://peninsulaadventuresports.com/events/gravel-unravel/bon-jon-pedal-bender/)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Bon Jon Pass climb specifics [ELITE perspective]:** "The first climb up towards Bon Jon Pass was just so long! I think it was approaching two hours for me to spin up the climb, topping off a bit shy of 4,000 feet, all the way from sea level." - Ted King (https://www.renehersecycles.com/ted-kings-impressions-from-bon-jon-pass/)

**Double-track section around mile 25:** "We entered a rough double-track section around mile 25 that required you to really pay attention. It was a 4×4 track that started pretty tame, but then presented plenty of challenges over the next nearly three rough miles... with plenty of whoops and dips." - Ted King [ELITE] (https://www.renehersecycles.com/ted-kings-impressions-from-bon-jon-pass/)

**Descent characteristics [ELITE perspective]:** "The screaming fast descents had wheel-eating potholes which would end your day badly if you weren't paying close attention. All the more difficult with mud splattering up from your front tire at high speeds." - Ted King (https://www.renehersecycles.com/ted-kings-impressions-from-bon-jon-pass/)

**Remote valley section:** "Then we reached a remote valley in the far reaches of the course, which was bucolic and just stunning. The sun popped out for us at that point, just at the right time because my breakaway companion Mark and I were both shivering from the long cold descent." - Ted King [ELITE] (https://www.renehersecycles.com/ted-kings-impressions-from-bon-jon-pass/)

**Long course specifics:** The 80-mile long course requires riders to "climb Bon Jon again!" - doing the pass twice. (https://peninsulaadventuresports.com/events/gravel-unravel/bon-jon-pedal-bender/)

**Rhododendron blooms:** "Luckily June is when the wild rhododendrons are in full bloom. Spotlighted against the deep green background of the forest, the blooms are sure to brighten up what might seem like an endless ascent." (https://peninsulaadventuresports.com/events/gravel-unravel/bon-jon-pedal-bender/)

**Finish line detail [ELITE advantage]:** "It's great to make the most with what we're provided... It turns out that staying on site a day before the race allowed for some inside info on just where the finish line turn existed." - Ted King [ELITE] (https://www.renehersecycles.com/ted-kings-impressions-from-bon-jon-pass/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Ted King [ELITE] - Race breakdown:** "We had a strong quartet up the first hour long climb towards Bon Jon Pass, then Mark Laughery pulled the two of us clear over the summit... Then, with most of the climbing done for the day by the half-way point, it was just a motoring race to the finish line, which was decided by just a few seconds between us." (https://www.renehersecycles.com/ted-kings-impressions-from-bon-jon-pass/)

**Ted King [ELITE] - Early race intensity:** "Immediately on hitting the lower slopes of the first climb out of the gates, I knew I had to pay attention because plenty of folks were eager to pick up the speed just as the gradient ticked up. In fact, I set my best 60-minute power for the year thanks to that section! After twenty minutes or so of going up, the peloton was shredded to just four riders taking pulls for the next forty minutes." (https://www.renehersecycles.com/ted-kings-impressions-from-bon-jon-pass/)

**Ted King [ELITE] - Nutrition strategy (55 miles, ~5,500ft):** "I started the day with a bowl of muesli and banana... I downed a Maple UnTapped packet with about 20 minutes before the start, then had two bottles of UnTapped Mapleaid on my bike, and another 9 packets total in my pockets. I knew we'd be churning through energy in that first hour, so I was consuming my nutrition steadily from the start, also knowing that once we topped out on the pass and started the descent, my fingers would be frigid, and I'd want to keep my hands on the bars... I consumed all of my nutrition and never wanted more or less." (https://www.renehersecycles.com/ted-kings-impressions-from-bon-jon-pass/)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Jan Heine [COMPETITIVE]:** "There was just the right combination of professional organization and down-to-earth vibe. It felt like racing way back, when cycling was a tiny sport, and you just assumed that anybody showing up was a friend, or would become one...
