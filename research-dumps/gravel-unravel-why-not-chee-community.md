## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**broshaughnessy [COMPETITIVE]:** Planning the long course with "FTP: 282, Weight: 74.45kg, CTL: 71, Planned TSB on race day: +10. Using this as a training race for Gran Fondo Winthrop in September." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/why-not-chee-gravel-unravel/85508)

**broshaughnessy [COMPETITIVE]:** "I'm hoping my Cervelo Aspero with 40mm tires can make it." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/why-not-chee-gravel-unravel/85508)

**ACree [COMPETITIVE]:** "I did the Hohly roller by the same promoter a couple years ago, and have done GFW several times. I'm sure it will be a good event. Possibly even dry. GFW is great (and hard)." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/why-not-chee-gravel-unravel/85508)

**zkravey [COMPETITIVE]:** Planning "the same course this year with roughly the same stats as you on my Domane with 35mm Gravelkings" (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/why-not-chee-gravel-unravel/85508)

**Ted King [ELITE - pro cyclist, multiple Tours de France]:** "I had pre-ridden the shortest distance, the 30 mile race, the day before the race, and, boy, was I impressed! I was also blown away by the challenge. Especially while trying hard to keep the powder dry for the next day's competition, the first climb up towards Bon Jon Pass was just so long! I think it was approaching two hours for me to spin up the climb, topping off a bit shy of 4,000 feet, all the way from sea level." (https://www.renehersecycles.com/gravel-racing-in-the-pacific-northwest/)

**Ted King [ELITE]:** Impressed by "the twisty, muddy double-track near the top of the pass" and "screaming-fast descents" with "wheel-eating potholes which would end your day badly if you weren't paying close attention." Also noted: "There's no showiness to this event, just people out having a good time on two wheels." (https://www.renehersecycles.com/gravel-racing-in-the-pacific-northwest/)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Minimum Tire Width [UNKNOWN LEVEL]:** Official race recommendation is "Minimum recommended tire width is 40mm" (https://peninsulaadventuresports.com/events/gravel-unravel/why-not-chee/)

**40mm tires [COMPETITIVE]:** broshaughnessy planning Cervelo Aspero with 40mm tires for the long course (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/why-not-chee-gravel-unravel/85508)

**35mm tires [COMPETITIVE]:** zkravey using Domane with 35mm Gravelkings, though this is below the official 40mm recommendation (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/why-not-chee-gravel-unravel/85508)

**MTB Setup [COMPETITIVE]:** ACree used "a 29er hardtail, with a rigid fork, and fast mtb tires" for similar Vicious Cycle events, noting "I've never regretted it on courses like this. Actual gravel bikes are faster on some of the climbs for sure, and the pavement. But there is enough very rough gravel that I don't think I'd be any faster on a drop bar bike." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/why-not-chee-gravel-unravel/85508)

**GPS/Navigation:** "Important: there is essentially zero cell coverage on the course – you will want to download the tracks onto your phone ahead of time. We have a RideWithGPS event membership, which means that you will be able to download routes for offline use for FREE, without having to get a paid membership." (https://peninsulaadventuresports.com/events/gravel-unravel/why-not-chee/)

## Weather Experienced

**2025 conditions:** Race held "in cloud and fog at high elevations" though conditions were described as "good."

(https://www.peninsuladailynews.com/sports/gravel-unravel-big-hills-thick-clouds-and-close-finishes/)

**General conditions [COMPETITIVE]:** ACree noted regarding similar events: "Possibly even dry" suggesting variable weather is common (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/why-not-chee-gravel-unravel/85508)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

Choose your own adventure: 1 One Lap: 23 Miles (The Sprint), 2 Two Laps: 46 Miles (The Mid), 3 Three Laps: 69 Miles (The Challenge)" (https://peninsulaadventuresports.com/events/gravel-unravel/why-not-chee/)

**Surface Composition:** "Each course is approximately 95% gravel. The surface data on Ride With GPS is not accurate." (https://peninsulaadventuresports.com/events/gravel-unravel/why-not-chee/)

**Route Details:** "The loops starts and ends at Satsop Center and heads west to do the 'Big Creek Loop' around Mount Fitzgerald. This area is peaceful, lush and green and perfect for a gravel adventure." (https://peninsulaadventuresports.com/events/gravel-unravel/why-not-chee/)

**Terrain Character:** Course includes "older growth forest offering pristine views of the region and lake, and around the lake in its entirety, including one mile of single-track that is the Maidenhair Falls Trail." Riders experience "the children of giants (Hemlock, Spruce, Douglas Fir, Western Red Cedar)." (https://peninsulaadventuresports.com/events/gravel-unravel/why-not-chee/)

**Rough Sections [COMPETITIVE]:** ACree noted "there is enough very rough gravel" to potentially favor MTB setups over pure gravel bikes (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/why-not-chee-gravel-unravel/85508)

**Loop Format Advantage:** "A loop course also means that friends and family can see you and cheer you on as you pass through Satsop Center between loops!" (https://peninsulaadventuresports.com/events/gravel-unravel/why-not-chee/)

**Training Strategy [COMPETITIVE]:** broshaughnessy using Why-Not-Chee "as a training race for Gran Fondo Winthrop in September" with planned positive TSB of +10 (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/why-not-chee-gravel-unravel/85508)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Cell Coverage:** "This area is remote and rugged with the nearest cell reception being nearly 40 minutes away unless you are up on the highest ridges." Described as "essentially zero cell coverage on the course." (https://peninsulaadventuresports.com/events/gravel-unravel/why-not-chee/)

**Navigation:** Must download GPS tracks ahead of time due to no cell coverage for on-the-fly route access (https://peninsulaadventuresports.com/events/gravel-unravel/why-not-chee/)

**Mechanical - Potholes [ELITE]:** Ted King specifically warned of "wheel-eating potholes" on descents that "would end your day badly if you weren't paying close attention" (https://www.renehersecycles.com/gravel-racing-in-the-pacific-northwest/)

**Tire Size:** Riders using narrower than the recommended 40mm minimum may face increased risk on rough gravel sections (https://peninsulaadventuresports.com/events/gravel-unravel/why-not-chee/)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Camping Culture:** "Part of the race fee pays for the organizers to haul in water for the racers. Part of it also pays for lunch/early dinner after the race... If there's a race that deserves the title 'the most epic race you've never heard about,' it's Why-Not-Chee." (https://www.renehersecycles.com/gravel-racing-in-the-pacific-northwest/)

**Remote Location:** "There's no trouble finding accommodations for the Why-Not-Chee race—just bring a tent. This area is so remote that there are no accommodations, so you've got to camp to do this race or leave very early to drive to the start." (https://www.renehersecycles.com/gravel-racing-in-the-pacific-northwest/)

**Inclusive Atmosphere [ELITE]:** Ted King observed: "There's no showiness to this event, just people out having a good time on two wheels." (https://www.renehersecycles.com/gravel-racing-in-the-pacific-northwest/)

**Grassroots Character:** "These events are inclusive of everybody because they represent the local community. Seasoned racers who know their power numbers by heart mingle with riders who've never even contemplated putting a power meter on their bikes." (https://www.renehersecycles.com/gravel-racing-in-the-pacific-northwest/)

**Female Participation:** "These races have no fewer than 20% female participants—more than most bike races." Organized by Lorrie, "a woman—who also directs running and multi-sport races, together with Buck, who runs a small bike shop on the Olympic Coast." (https://www.renehersecycles.com/gravel-racing-in-the-pacific-northwest/)

**Post-Race:** "All participants receive a professional, well-organized event, RFID timing, a well-marked course, on-course snacks and medical support, mechanical support, a finisher token of badassness, and post-race hot food and cold drinks. There will be a beer garden at the race finish should you want to purchase a frosty bevvie." (https://www.bikesignup.com/Race/WA/Hoquiam/GravelUnravelWhyNotChee)

**Camping Options:** "Satsop Center Camping," "Free dispersed camping is allowed on Olympic National Forest land," camping "along 2222 Road, or known as the 'concrete pad' where we had the Start and Finish last year," and "Coho Campground – for those with medium or large RVs or trailers, or who like a more traditional campground experience, there is also Coho Campground on Wynoochee Lake... Coho Campground is 3.5 miles from Race Central and is right on the lake." (https://peninsulaadventuresports.com/events/gravel-unravel/why-not-chee/)

**Historical Context:** "The Wynoochee Lake area represents some of the deepest logging roots in the state, if not the country, with the last of the company-owned logging camps in the continental United States, Camp Grisdale, located just south of the lake." Riders experience the region "home to the first peoples of the Chehalis." (https://peninsulaadventuresports.com/events/gravel-unravel/why-not-chee/)
