# GRAVEL WORLDS AMATEUR — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Race Overview & Format

Gravel Worlds (the original Nebraska event, not the UCI version) offers multiple distance options accommodating riders of all levels competing together:

- **GW150**: ~150 miles, 10,000+ ft elevation, the championship distance where "Overall Male, Female, NB, and Para Male/Female win the title of Captain of the Gravel Seas, World Champions Jersey, and Sword Trophy. World championship jerseys are up for grabs in all gender and age categories." Start times are staggered: 5:55am Elite Men, 6:05am Elite Women, 6:30am General Field (https://www.gravelworlds.com)

- **GW75**: ~75 miles, 5,000 ft elevation, "shortened course will test the mettle and give no quarter" with checkpoints and aid stations. 7AM start (https://www.gravelworlds.com)

- **GW35**: 35 miles, ~2,000 ft elevation, "non-competitive event" for those wanting to "get their feet wet in the world of gravel." 8AM start (https://www.gravelworlds.com)

- **GW300**: 300+ miles, 15,000+ ft elevation, "100% self-supported, the only oasis riders will find on this voyage will be from public gas stations and water stops provided." 5PM Friday start (https://www.gravelworlds.com)

**Event dates**: August 19-23, 2026 in Lincoln, Nebraska (https://www.gravelworlds.com)

The event philosophy emphasizes inclusivity: "We're using the pro field to make Gravel Worlds better for the everyday rider—by increasing safety, expanding our expo, adding more on-course resources, and elevating the entire experience for everyone who shows up to ride." They offer free entry for Junior/U18 racers and discounted U23 entry.

## Prize Purse & Competition Level

**[ELITE]:** The 2026 event offers a "$150,000 USD" prize purse, "the largest single-day prize purse in all of gravel cycling," with money "distributed evenly across men's and women's fields." (https://granfondodailynews.com/2026/01/25/2026-gravel-worlds-not-the-uci-version-offering-massive-150000-record-setting-prize-purse/)

This means top-level professional competition will be present, with elite men and women starting separately before the general amateur field.

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

The GW150 course ventures "through the rural farmlands of Southeastern Nebraska" with "constant rolling hills" characteristic of the terrain. (https://www.gravelworlds.com)

The GW300 description emphasizes the cumulative challenge of Nebraska terrain: "Over 300 miles of constant rolling hills that will amass over 15,000 ft of elevation" suggests the terrain is characterized by persistent, moderate grades rather than dramatic climbs. (https://www.gravelworlds.com)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

Rule #1 at Gravel Worlds is "BE COOL!" (https://www.gravelworlds.com)

**Organizer Jason Strohbehn [UNKNOWN]:** "We're proud to be leaders in moving our sport forward. But this isn't just about the pro race. We're using the pro field to make Gravel Worlds better for the everyday rider—by increasing safety, expanding our expo, adding more on-course resources, and elevating the entire experience for everyone who shows up to ride."

## Race Support & Logistics

**GW150 & GW75:** Include "checkpoints and high-seas refueling opportunities" with aid provided by organizers. (https://www.gravelworlds.com)

**GW300:** "100% self-supported, the only oasis riders will find on this voyage will be from public gas stations and water stops provided" — meaning riders must plan resupply around available public facilities along the 300-mile route. (https://www.gravelworlds.com)

**GW35:** Described as having "one checkpoint stop along the route" for the 35-mile course. (https://www.gravelworlds.com)
