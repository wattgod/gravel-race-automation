## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Carey Lowery [ELITE]:** "This BDR really whooped my ass... I raced this last year and got 3rd age group, despite a navigational error that cost me 60 minutes and gave me 17 bonus miles. So this year I was back for redemption." (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2023/08/gravel-worlds-race-report.html)

**Carey Lowery [ELITE]:** "In 3 hours, Lincoln was hit with 2 1/2 inches of rain! Aye yai yai!... My speed was immediately cut in half as I entered the chocolate smoothie and I had to back off the wheels of those ahead of me. Now it was all about surviving and keeping forward momentum as I slipped and slided my way through the next 3 1/2 hours of hellacious kilojoule-sapping mire." (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2023/08/gravel-worlds-race-report.html)

**Carey Lowery [ELITE]:** "Last year it took 3:25 to go 54 miles; this year, 4:30. I was over an hour behind last year's time." (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2023/08/gravel-worlds-race-report.html)

**Carey Lowery [ELITE]:** "Miles 80-100 were the hardest for me, as I was beginning to tire from the monotony. But this is also where I engaged my mental game. I smiled and gave words of encouragement as I passed those who had passed me earlier in the day... I also began to smile outwards and say out loud what I was grateful for." (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2023/08/gravel-worlds-race-report.html)

**Carey Lowery [ELITE]:** "I rolled under the finishing banner in 11:34... I am so grateful I have the ability to do these crazy events. While the course may not be as 'fun' and have as much eye candy as what I ride back home, I love the vibes of Gravel Worlds and how no one is more important than another. We are all equal here!" (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2023/08/gravel-worlds-race-report.html)

**Matt Beers [ELITE]:** "The running in the mud made it really hard and really decisive, to be honest. I got caught out in the first mud section pretty bad, and I had to bridge up through three groups, so I really had to dig in to stay at the front." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/results-matt-beers-and-rosa-kloser-win-lauf-gravel-worlds-2025-in-a-duo-of-two-up-sprints/)

**Matt Beers [ELITE]:** "It was really fun to go to the line with one of my best mates. We played our cards and attacked in the right spots. On the last MMR road, Keegan went really hard, and I just stuck with him before we motored on and sprinted at the finish. I have been working on my sprints so I was pretty confident — but yeah, brutal day out there." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/results-matt-beers-and-rosa-kloser-win-lauf-gravel-worlds-2025-in-a-duo-of-two-up-sprints/)

**Rosa Klöser [ELITE]:** "It was quite tough, I must say. The second MMR was quite muddy, and at the end we made a split with six of us. I was really on the limit with my bike; I just made it out. I could see how packed my bike was with mud. Gee [Schreurs] was really driving it, and she was like, 'Girls, this is the move of the day.' Then I decided to just grind it out. Due to the SRAM Transmission system, I could push it in the mud without losing the derailleur." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/results-matt-beers-and-rosa-kloser-win-lauf-gravel-worlds-2025-in-a-duo-of-two-up-sprints/)

**Rosa Klöser [ELITE]:** "The next mud section was when it really split up. I reckoned that section when I arrived, and it was muddy after two days of no rain, so I knew it was one to watch. I took the grass, and the other girls took the mud and were stuck. But Gee is so good at mud she managed to come back to me." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/results-matt-beers-and-rosa-kloser-win-lauf-gravel-worlds-2025-in-a-duo-of-two-up-sprints/)

**Rosa Klöser [ELITE]:** "On the last climbs, I could tell I was fresher, but we actually talked after we made the split to commit to it together. Over such a long distance, you form an ally, so we agreed we'd sprint it out in the end." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/results-matt-beers-and-rosa-kloser-win-lauf-gravel-worlds-2025-in-a-duo-of-two-up-sprints/)

**Rosa Klöser [ELITE]:** "After a mud section we were initially in a break of six riders. Already, in that break, I could clearly tell that G (Geerike) and I were really trying to push the pace. At CORE4 last week we had to walk a lot of the mud sections, so I think we had a bit of an edge on the other riders with picking lines through the mud." (https://www.slowtwitch.com/gravel/rosa-kloser-wins-gravel-worlds-after-epic-breakaway-with-geerike-schreurs/)

**Geerike Schreurs [ELITE]:** "I should have tried to make a move, I know, but I was actually really tired, and it was hard to stay on her wheel at times." (https://www.slowtwitch.com/gravel/rosa-kloser-wins-gravel-worlds-after-epic-breakaway-with-geerike-schreurs/)

**Mathew Wollmann [UNKNOWN]:** "August 24th, 2024, my third iteration of the Garmin Gravel Worlds 300. A 300-mile bike race on mostly if not all gravel... This event is challenging. It doesn't start until 5 PM Friday. To truly be well rested ideally you sleep in until past noon... I hit the bed around midnight and indeed, slept in past or near noon. No regrets. I felt amazing and carefree for the first time on race day." (https://www.mathewwollmann.com/post/garmin-gravel-worlds-300-2024-race-recap)

**Mathew Wollmann [UNKNOWN]:** "That night I was all over the road. Literally yelling out loud to wake up. Digestively I was great. I always felt full and had no cramps. Things were going very smoothly." (https://www.mathewwollmann.com/post/garmin-gravel-worlds-300-2024-race-recap)

**Mathew Wollmann [UNKNOWN]:** "As the sun rose I knew that the hard part was behind me. Even with no sleep, a sunrise will bring you to life. It's an amazing feeling to be recharged by its energy." (https://www.mathewwollmann.com/post/garmin-gravel-worlds-300-2024-race-recap)

**Mathew Wollmann [UNKNOWN]:** "At mile 287 I began to feel my first cramps... I knew that if I stopped I don't think I would get any better, and would run the risk of losing a few spots. I pressed on. At this point, I was almost out of drinkable water and was out of water to spray on me. I began to stop sweating, developed a headache, and the cramps got worse. Uh oh, I've been here before. Thankfully I knew to just back it off a bit... So I got myself a free IV!" (https://www.mathewwollmann.com/post/garmin-gravel-worlds-300-2024-race-recap)

**Paige Powered [ELITE]:** "I felt like he was heckling me from the side of the road. I felt like I was being framed with his massive camera lens doing his 'media coverage.' I quickly thought through some scenarios... I am the last person to support any sort of male domestique... But suddenly, I felt this rut in my stomach and what I value more than a race result is my dignity and respect among the community I race with. When I felt that he had the power to put that on the line, the decision was easy. I told my teammate and the other two guys to go up the road." (https://www.paigepowered.com/post/gravel-worlds-race-recap)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Carey Lowery [ELITE]:** Trek CheckPoint with Bontrager 40mm GR1 tires. Drivetrain was SRAM AXS with a 36T chainring and 10-52 cassette. Chose not to use a hydration pack and ran 2x 28-ounce bottles. (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2023/08/gravel-worlds-race-report.html)

**Carey Lowery [ELITE]:** Ran a Bontrager Ion 200 RT light for the pre-dawn start: "It didn't throw much light, but I was counting on being close enough to others. I did not want to lug around a larger light for 10+ hours when the sun would be up in 20 minutes." (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2023/08/gravel-worlds-race-report.html)

**Carey Lowery [ELITE]:** "Sniper, my steed, was plowing through this like a champ. I was having zero drive train issues. My brakes were taking a beating, as the road grime was splashing up on the rotors and wearing down my brake pads, even though I hardly used them." (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2023/08/gravel-worlds-race-report.html)

**Rosa Klöser [ELITE]:** "Due to the SRAM Transmission system, I could push it in the mud without losing the derailleur." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/results-matt-beers-and-rosa-kloser-win-lauf-gravel-worlds-2025-in-a-duo-of-two-up-sprints/)

**Mathew Wollmann [UNKNOWN]:** "I went with my tried and true setup... super light setup with two aspero bags. A top tube bag with essentials such as plugs, CO2, lights, battery, etc. Things I would need quickly. My saddle bag contained a light rain jacket, two extra embark maple pouches, and my shaded oakelys. I started the race with clear lenses on so I didn't have to stop and transition between the two." Switched to Sworks Power saddle. Used Red Shift aero bars. Two bottles on frame with Embark maple mix, and a USWE Rush 8L Bike Hydration Vest with Nuun electrolyte tablets. (https://www.mathewwollmann.com/post/garmin-gravel-worlds-300-2024-race-recap)

## Weather Experienced

**2023 Race (Pre-race):** "Boy, it was hot! 100+ degrees and the gravel was dusty!" (Carey Lowery, https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2023/08/gravel-worlds-race-report.html)

**2023 Race (Night before/Race morning):** "Friday night we went to bed knowing that there was a 40% chance of rain... In 3 hours, Lincoln was hit with 2 1/2 inches of rain!... It was still raining at the start and the temperature was a chilly 69 degrees." (Carey Lowery, https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2023/08/gravel-worlds-race-report.html)

**2023 Race (During):** "The rains eventually stopped and the sun came out. The roads were still sludge, but I knew eventually they would dry out and the fast lines would reappear... The headwinds were not brutal, but still pretty harsh at 15mph. There was a decent amount of cloud cover and the winds were cool all day." (Carey Lowery, https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2023/08/gravel-worlds-race-report.html)

**2024 Race (300-mile):** "Race weather proved to be gorgeous with a tailwind most of the night. A chance of rain depending where you were on the course closer to morning... temps were projected to rise above 100 with heat indexes up to 105." (Mathew Wollmann, https://www.mathewwollmann.com/post/garmin-gravel-worlds-300-2024-race-recap)

**2025 Race:** "With a crisp 5:55 AM start for the men, there is a full hour of racing before the sun emerges... Adding to the darkness was the weather that rolled in the night before dousing portions of the course with plenty of precipitation." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/results-matt-beers-and-rosa-kloser-win-lauf-gravel-worlds-2025-in-a-duo-of-two-up-sprints/)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Gravel Surface:** "The gravel here is small pea gravel/sand mixture... the fine gravel/sand/dirt mixture soaked it up like a sponge." (Carey Lowery [ELITE], https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2023/08/gravel-worlds-race-report.html)

**Post-Rain Conditions:** "The water does not run off the roads here like back home, but rather the fine gravel/sand/dirt mixture soaked it up like a sponge. My speed was immediately cut in half as I entered the chocolate smoothie... More than once I thought about just tucking tail and turning back, after seeing many people off their bikes looking at their drivetrains and playing with their chains." (Carey Lowery [ELITE], https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2023/08/gravel-worlds-race-report.html)

**Bohemian Alps Section:** "North of Lincoln, the area is called the Bohemian Alps, named after the Czech immigrants who settled here. Full of rolling hills, one after another after another. None are long, but all are steep. This year's course, compared to last year's, had more of this." (Carey Lowery [ELITE], https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2023/08/gravel-worlds-race-report.html)

**B-Roads/MMR Sections:** "I hit the first B-road around mile 70 and I felt like I was on a single track ribbon of dark chocolate. There was a 18 inch wide path of firm ground on this road, but to either side it was sticky mud. As long as I held the line, I was fine. It was groovy!" (Carey Lowery [ELITE], https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2023/08/gravel-worlds-race-report.html)

**MMR Decisive Nature:** "The addition of new venue locations and comprehensive live coverage will bring the race to a broader audience, showcasing American gravel racing like never before... These MMRs, as they are called, often times define the racing as much as any climbs. Sure enough, those wet MMRs were the decider in both the men's and women's races, especially in the first three sectors in the first 30 miles." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/results-matt-beers-and-rosa-kloser-win-lauf-gravel-worlds-2025-in-a-duo-of-two-up-sprints/)

**Checkpoint Features:** "There was a short, 0.4 mile cross course I had to do, including riding through a barn, before I hit the aid station." (Carey Lowery [ELITE], https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2023/08/gravel-worlds-race-report.html)

**300-Mile Course:** "The gravel roads were halfway decent, with only a few with big chunky rocks. We were beginning to get into the roller portions of the course, which were mentally draining." (Mathew Wollmann [UNKNOWN], https://www.mathewwollmann.com/post/garmin-gravel-worlds-300-2024-race-recap)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Carey Lowery [ELITE] - 150-mile strategy:** Stopped at checkpoints at mile 54 (4 minutes) and mile 108 (4+ minutes). Topped off water at a well spigot in Brainard mid-course rather than stopping at c-store at mile 88. "I was on a mission." Finished in 11:34. (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2023/08/gravel-worlds-race-report.html)

**Carey Lowery [ELITE] - Mud strategy:** "I tried not to spend too many matches, but sometimes it was all I could do just to keep the bike moving forward on some of the climbs. Many were walking." (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2023/08/gravel-worlds-race-report.html)

**Carey Lowery [ELITE] - Mental tactics:** "Miles 80-100 were the hardest for me, as I was beginning to tire from the monotony. But this is also where I engaged my mental game. I smiled and gave words of encouragement as I passed those who had passed me earlier in the day... I also began to smile outwards and say out loud what I was grateful for. All these tactics made it easier on the legs and the mind." (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2023/08/gravel-worlds-race-report.html)

**Carey Lowery [ELITE] - Caffeine strategy:** "The last 20 miles seemed to fly by; it might have something to do with the 200mg caffeine pill I took at the last CP as well as the 3 gels I had consumed, each having an additional 90mg of caffeine. Vroom vroom!" (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2023/08/gravel-worlds-race-report.html)

**Elite Men's Race Strategy (2025):** "13 dwindled to nine heading into a crucial aid station where the leaders would have to choose who needed to stop for water versus those who could carry on without stopping. Since Gravel Worlds is staunchly self-supported, there is no outside assistance and no handups. That means you must either start with everything you need or stop at the neutral aid stations. Ultimately, six of the leaders carried on — including Beers and Swenson — while Jones, Roberge, and Brendan Johnston stopped for water and fuel." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/results-matt-beers-and-rosa-kloser-win-lauf-gravel-worlds-2025-in-a-duo-of-two-up-sprints/)

**Rosa Klöser [ELITE] - Collaboration strategy:** "We had a quick chat and we decided we would commit together because we knew with our power on the flats and on those rolling hills we could drive it home." After 120-mile breakaway together, agreed to sprint it out at the end. (https://www.slowtwitch.com/gravel/rosa-kloser-wins-gravel-worlds-after-epic-breakaway-with-geerike-schreurs/)

**Mathew Wollmann [UNKNOWN] - 300-mile strategy:** Goals were Sub-24 hrs (achieved 21:53), Top 20 overall (finished 19th), Sub 1 hr off-bike-time (106 min). Gas station stops at miles 57, 131, and 189 (took 8-minute nap at last stop). "My goal of staying on the bike, and making my gas station stops fast AF was paying off." (https://www.mathewwollmann.com/post/garmin-gravel-worlds-300-2024-race-recap)

**Mathew Wollmann [UNKNOWN] - Sleep management:** "Usually, the night before I'm in bed by 10 PM... This event is challenging. It doesn't start until 5 PM Friday. To truly be well rested ideally you sleep in until past noon... I tried a different tactic this year... hit the bed around midnight and indeed, slept in past or near noon. No regrets. I felt amazing and carefree for the first time on race day." (https://www.mathewwollmann.com/post/garmin-gravel-worlds-300-2024-race-recap)

**Paige Powered [ELITE] - Early race decisions:** "The obvious plan was that none of the females would truly work until the men's group came by and we could latch onto their groups... As the men's strung out pack came barreling through, I made a jump into a small gap and then tried to hammer as best I could." Made decision to not go solo off group due to headwinds and 100+ miles remaining. (https://www.paigepowered.com/post/gravel-worlds-race-recap)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Mechanical Issues in Mud:** "More than once I thought about just tucking tail and turning back, after seeing many people off their bikes looking at their drivetrains and playing with their chains." (Carey Lowery [ELITE], https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2023/08/gravel-worlds-race-report.html)

**Heat-Related Issues:** "At mile 287 I began to feel my first cramps... I was almost out of drinkable water and was out of water to spray on me. I began to stop sweating, developed a headache, and the cramps got worse." Finished but needed IV post-race. (Mathew Wollmann [UNKNOWN], https://www.mathewwollmann.com/post/garmin-gravel-worlds-300-2024-race-recap)

**Mud-Induced Eliminations:** "The first three MMRs defined the race. Not only did it bring certain contenders to the fore, it also seemed to eliminate a few key challengers who would typically play a role in Gravel Worlds: Lauren Stephens, minutes back; Morgan Aguirre, minutes back; Sofia Gomez Villafañe, minutes back; Lauren De Crecenzo, minutes back." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/results-matt-beers-and-rosa-kloser-win-lauf-gravel-worlds-2025-in-a-duo-of-two-up-sprints/)

**Night Riding Fatigue (300-mile):** "That night I was all over the road. Literally yelling out loud to wake up... Just before sunrise... I was all over the road. Literally yelling out loud to wake up... I set my alarm and laid my phone on my chest, hoping someone would steal my bike." (Mathew Wollmann [UNKNOWN], https://www.mathewwollmann.com/post/garmin-gravel-worlds-300-2024-race-recap)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Carey Lowery [ELITE]:** "I love the vibes of Gravel Worlds and how no one is more important than another. We are all equal here! The race organizers are wonderful people and have their shit dialed! They work tirelessly for days to make sure our experience is a positive one." (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2023/08/gravel-worlds-race-report.html)

**Event Philosophy:** "We didn't ride gravel because it was the cool thing to do, we simply rode gravel because it was what we had and it was fun. So that is what we will always strive for our events, keeping gravel FUN!" (https://www.gravelworlds.com/about)

**Origins:** "We started out as a group of friends in 2008 who loved riding and just wanted to play bikes without all the rules. Like kids on a playground we made up our own rules together. No categories, no officials, no prize money, just bumping elbows, bleeding lungs, blown up legs, with beers and stories at the finish." (https://www.gravelworlds.com/about)

**"First to Last" Initiative:** "When the sun goes down on the finish line, every rider will be welcomed with a party inside the finish gate. Everyone will be encouraged to come and celebrate... Furthermore, Gravel Worlds has extended the cut-off time of that race from 9:00 p.m. to 9:59 p.m. so riders will have an additional hour to make it across the finish." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/garmin-gravel-worlds/)

**Jason Strohbehn (Lead Promoter):** "Garmin Gravel Worlds has always been about more than just the race. It's about the shared experience and camaraderie among participants, while also contributing to causes much greater than ourselves. We are out to prove than one event can celebrate the peak of human performance, while also celebrating every participant that's persevered through their own challenges." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/garmin-gravel-worlds/)

**Randy Gibson Memorial:** "#RideForRandy - Randy Gibson was one of the greatest humans in our Gravel Family. We lost Randy to a drunk driver in 2017. Those who were blessed to know him still think of him when we throw our leg over and start pedaling on the gravel seas." (https://www.gravelworlds.com/about)

**Mathew Wollmann [UNKNOWN]:** "I truly think each of us needs to do at least 1 massive physical task each year. Remind ourselves what we truly are capable of. For some, it's a 5k. For others in an ultra event. But PLEASE don't underestimate yourself. You are so capable of greatness. And for the love of god never degrade your abilities because of someone else's accomplishments. Do YOUR best." (https://www.mathewwollmann.com/post/garmin-gravel-worlds-300-2024-race-recap)
