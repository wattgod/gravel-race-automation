# GRAVEL WORLDS - RAW RESEARCH DUMP



**OFFICIAL DATA**

**Distances & Elevation:** Gravel Worlds offers multiple race distances. The flagship **150-mile** “Gravel Worlds Championship” course features around **10,000+ ft of climbing** . The popular **75-mile** route (sometimes called the “Privateer”) is roughly 75–78 miles with ~5,000 ft elevation gain  . There is also a shorter **35-mile** fun ride (~2,000 ft climbing)  and an ultra-endurance **300-mile “Long Voyage”** boasting **15,000–20,000 ft** of climbing  . In recent years they even added a **10-mile** introductory ride and running events (5k up to 50k) plus a triathlon during the weekend  . All bike races start and finish in Lincoln, Nebraska, traversing the rolling gravel roads of the surrounding counties.

**Date:** Gravel Worlds is held annually in **late August**. It spans a multi-day festival: for example, in 2025 events took place August 20–24 . The main 150mi and 75mi bike races typically start early Saturday morning of that week (e.g. 6:30am on Saturday Aug 22, 2026)  . The 300-mile “Long Voyage” begins the evening prior (e.g. 5pm Friday) since it runs overnight . August timing means riders often face peak summer conditions (more on weather below). The event has a long history – 2025 was the **16th year** of Gravel Worlds  (founded 2008 under Pirate Cycling League).

**Field Size:** Participation has grown from an underground hundred-rider grassroots race into an event drawing **thousands**. In 2021 over **1,700 riders** were registered (from 48 states and 8 countries) . By 2025 it attracted roughly **1,500–2,000** athletes across all categories, plus spectators (an estimated 6,000 total people attended)  . The main 150-mile race field is typically a few hundred riders. (Notably, 2022 saw record participation – about 1,600 finishers total across distances – after an initiative to get 1,000 women riding, whereas 2024 saw closer to 1,000 finishers due in part to extreme weather)  . The **elite/pro field** is a subset competing for the title “Captain of the Gravel Seas” (men’s and women’s winners get a champions jersey and pirate sword trophy) . But Gravel Worlds remains open to all skill levels and ages – truly an inclusive “gravel family” event.

**Entry Fees:** Registration costs (as of 2025–2026) are on par with major gravel events, and vary by distance. The 150-mile race was about **$195** per rider (rising to $205 closer to race date)  . The 75-mile was around **$165** (later $175) . The 300-mile “Long Voyage” was roughly **$190–$200** . Shorter options (35mi, 50k) were cheaper (e.g. $75 for the 35mi ride) . These entry fees typically include a t-shirt or swag, finisher award (150mi finishers earn a pirate sword trophy or medal; 300mi finishers get a belt buckle), and support at the official checkpoints. Despite growing prize purses for the pros (the 2025 pro race had an unprecedented $100,000 purse split among categories)  , Gravel Worlds still emphasizes its grassroots feel – the **registration is first-come, first-served** on BikeReg each winter (no lottery system).

**Time Cutoffs:** Gravel Worlds enforces generous but firm time limits for safety. For the 150-mile, **official timing ends at 10:00pm**, about **15.5 hours** after the morning start . This equates to an average minimum pace around 9.5 mph. There are intermediate **checkpoint cutoffs** as well: riders must reach Checkpoint 1 (~mile 60) and Checkpoint 2 (~mile 110) before the cutoff times (roughly 12 hours total, meaning CP2 closes around 6:30pm) . The 300-mile has about a **30-hour** limit (with finish by ~11pm the next day) . If a rider cannot maintain the pace (e.g. struggling with heat or mechanicals), organizers will pull them from the course after cutoff. Notably, in 2024 the brutal conditions caused about one-third of the 150-mile starters to miss the cut (only **97 of ~150 starters finished** within time)  . Shorter events have their own cutoffs (e.g. ~8.5 hours for the 50k run) . Overall, riders have until late evening to officially complete the 150. The **winners** finish much faster (often ~7 hours for 150mi) , but Gravel Worlds is proud of celebrating the final finishers as well – the last-place **DFL (“Dead Freakin’ Last”) finisher** is cheered and even awarded with 40 bottles of champagne in a playful ceremony , underscoring the event’s inclusive spirit.

**TERRAIN & COURSE**

**Rolling Hills:** The course terrain is defined by **relentless rolling hills** of southeastern Nebraska farmland. Despite perceptions of the prairie, *“Nebraska isn’t flat”* . A local quip from 2018 was that the 150-mile course had **“about 87 hills”**  – essentially one roller after another. Riders describe it as *“never-ending hills”* that force constant power surges; one veteran admitted that riding in Lincoln’s hills felt like doing *“intervals for 4 hours”* straight . The rollers are short to moderate climbs but very frequent – the gravel roads rise and dip over each drainage. Total elevation gain for 150mi is ~10k feet, which surprises those from flatter areas. Even elite gravel racers note these hills can be *harder than Unbound’s*, as they come in unrelenting succession . There are virtually **no prolonged flats** on the route – you’re either climbing or descending the “gravel seas” of Nebraska. Downhills can be fast but often washboarded (corrugated) or loose, requiring caution . In summary: the course will work your legs constantly.

**Road Surface:** The majority of the course is on **gravel county roads**, many of which are *crushed limestone* or local crushed rock. These range from well-packed smooth sections to areas of deep, loose gravel (“pea gravel”) that can feel like sand traps . Riders must stay alert for sudden patches of deep gravel that can wash out wheels . There are also rutted washboard stretches that punish the body – one 150mi rider vividly described *“perineum-pounding washboard roads”* that made his eyeballs vibrate  . Tires and gear get a real shaking on those rough sections.

Gravel Worlds likes to throw in a bit of everything: expect **minimum maintenance roads (MMRs)** – essentially dirt tracks – and even some “un-road” sectors. In dry years MMRs are dusty double-track; in wet years they turn to thick **mud**. In 2023 and 2025, rain turned ~8 miles of the course’s dirt roads into sticky, *“chain-clogging mud”* that became **race-defining obstacles**  . It’s a gamble: those sections are manageable in good weather but a mudbath if storms roll through. The organizers have a pirate sense of humor with the route: one report noted the course can include everything from *“gravel, crushed limestone paths, paved paths, two-tracks, cobble-filled alleyways, beautiful forests, [to] even some singletrack”* near Lincoln . In other words, be ready for surprises – while the core is rural gravel roads, there may be short paved stretches connecting sectors and quirky fun segments (e.g. a brief rails-trail or a lane through a farmstead).

**Course Layout:** The route changes every year, but it always **starts and ends in Lincoln** (often at the Fallbrook area on the edge of town, e.g. SchillingBridge Tap House has hosted starts/finishes ). Riders head out into Lancaster and adjacent counties, making a large loop (151-155 miles for the full course) that eventually returns to Lincoln . Navigation is typically via GPS file – the courses are marked sparingly, keeping with gravel culture. The **150-mile course** usually features two **official checkpoints** (around mile ~60 and ~110) and passes through a couple small rural towns  . The **300-mile Long Voyage** is an extended adventure that in recent editions has even left Nebraska (the 300 has ventured into Iowa, Missouri and back) . That route is *“a challenge like none other,”* covering 300+ miles of gravel across **three states** . All courses are characterized by scenic farm country: open fields, big sky, and virtually no shade – *“rolling, scenic backroads of Lancaster, Otoe, Cass, and Seward Counties”* make up the playground .

In summary, the Gravel Worlds course is **hilly, dusty (or muddy), and challenging**. As one 2018 race report put it, the day was accented by *“endless hills and heat.”*  Riders must prepare for constant rollers, variable gravel conditions, and possibly brutal weather. It’s not a mountainous course (max elevations are low), but the ceaseless up-and-down can be even more taxing in its own way.

**WEATHER HISTORY (August Nebraska heat)**

Late August in eastern Nebraska is **hot and often humid** – classic Midwestern summer conditions. Average highs in Lincoln are in the mid-80s °F (around 30°C) , but heat waves frequently push temperatures into the 90s and even low 100s °F. The combination of high heat, sun exposure, and humidity has made heat exhaustion a real concern in many editions of Gravel Worlds.

**Notable Hot Years:** 2018 earned the nickname “150 *Hot* Miles” – riders faced a very warm day and intense sun. By afternoon the thermometer climbed well into the 90s°F. Riders recalled that edition as *“a day accented by endless hills and heat.”*  More recently, **2024** was extremely brutal: the race weekend coincided with a heat wave. One finisher reported the *“heat index was 105+°F”* (over 40°C) during the day . Many riders struggled in the sun, and the attrition rate was high (about one-third of the 150-mile field DNF’d that year due to the heat)  . In fact, numerous participants downgraded from 150 to 75 miles at the last minute in 2024 when they saw the forecast of triple-digit heat . By mid-afternoon that year, the gravel felt like an oven – one rider described riding *“into a furnace headwind”* for miles, which *“pretty much slaughtered”* the back half of the field . 2021 was another scorcher, with temperatures in the upper 90s°F and high humidity; 2021’s 300-mile “Long Voyage” started at 5pm with the thermometer still around **95°F** at the start .

**Storms and Mud:** While heat is the norm, Nebraska weather can also throw curveballs. Thunderstorms are possible in August. In **2023**, an overnight storm on race-eve dumped rain on the course, which created significant mud in the low-lying MMR sections  . That year saw *“intense…heat, rain, grit”* all in one weekend  – racers endured muddy stretches in the morning, then later the sun came out and temps rose into the 90s, causing a sweltering, steamy afternoon. Some years have even started unseasonably cool: a 2012 rider recalled a freak cold front that made the morning start in the upper 40s°F (about 9°C), a stark contrast to the usual triple-digit heat leading up to the race . But such cool race days are rare. Typically, **extreme heat** is a bigger factor than rain.

**Heat Management:** Gravel Worlds emphasizes staying hydrated and safe in the heat. Organizers provide water, ice, and electrolyte drink at checkpoints, and remind riders that if the day turns into a scorcher, *“with the possibility of extreme heat…it is unsafe for [exhausted] riders to be out [indefinitely]”* . Many riders adopt strategies like soaking in shade at aid stops, dousing themselves with water, and monitoring their pace. In 2024, riders reported taking extended breaks at mile 100 and 120 just to cool down and get electrolytes in . The event’s mid-August timing virtually guarantees *some* level of heat – even on a “mild” year, it was noted that 2022 *“stayed pretty cool until the afternoon”* (implying the morning was pleasant but the afternoon still got hot) . So the pattern is often a tolerable start (70s°F at dawn) but building heat by noon and a blazing finish for those still on course mid-afternoon.

**Wind:** Nebraska’s plains can generate wind as well. A south or southeast wind on race day can compound the difficulty. Riders often face headwinds on certain legs of the loop. For instance, in 2024 there was a long northward leg in the middle of the day that turned into a brutal **headwind** grind (on top of the heat) . One participant wrote that from mile 60–120 they rode directly into hot headwind, which was soul-crushing in the sun . Wind can dry you out faster and make even moderate temps feel harsh. Conversely, a tailwind late in the race can be a savior. Nebraska is not as consistently windy as Kansas, but a 10–20 mph wind is not uncommon. It’s another factor to be ready for – veterans advise using aero bars if it’s forecasted to be windy, since *“150mi is a long day and if windy you’ll wish you had them.”* 

In summary, **expect heat**. The average high is ~87°F (30°C) , but be prepared for 95–100°F (35–38°C) and high humidity on the gravel roads (which have no shade). Carry plenty of fluids, use ice stockings or cooling packs if available, and pace yourself. And keep an eye on the sky – a pop-up thunderstorm could turn parts of the course into a mud slog, adding a whole different “element” to Gravel Worlds’ challenge.

**SELF-SUPPORTED RULES**

Gravel Worlds prides itself on being a **100% self-supported** event in the grassroots gravel tradition. This means **no outside support crews or hand-ups** are allowed – riders must fend for themselves using the event-provided aid or public resources available to everyone. The official rules explicitly state **“NO OUTSIDE SUPPORT!!”** – no team cars, no friends/family supplying you on course . Support crews are not even allowed to meet you at checkpoints; in fact, organizers ask that spectators *do not attempt to drive* on course to find riders, as it creates dangerous traffic on the gravel roads . Every rider, from the front-runners to the party-paced, carries their own food, water, and tools or uses the communal aid stations. Essentially, if you have a mechanical or nutritional need, you either fix it yourself or get help from a fellow participant (that camaraderie is encouraged). This rule ethos is summed up by Pirate Cycling League’s simple credo: **Rule #1: “Be Cool” (help others if needed, and don’t be a dick) .**

**Aid Stations:** *What* support is provided? The race organizers set up a couple of official **checkpoints** on the course (for the 150mi, usually 2 checkpoints ~50–60 miles apart  ; the 75mi has 1 checkpoint ~midway ). These checkpoints are stocked with *basic supplies*: **water (plenty of it), electrolyte drink mix, fruit, energy bars/gels, soda, salty snacks (chips, etc.),** and even some fun surprises like beef jerky and hot dogs from local sponsors  . They also typically have **porta-potties** and basic first aid. Importantly, there is **basic mechanical support** at checkpoints – a local bike shop sets up a tent with some spare tubes, lube, and a mechanic for emergency repairs . But this is for quick fixes; major repairs are on you. Checkpoints are **“required”** in that every rider must at least check in and cross the timing mat there (to ensure no one shortcuts the course) . You *may* skip taking supplies if you’re fully self-sufficient, but it’s not wise to do so in the heat.

Between official checkpoints, Gravel Worlds often arranges at least one **“Oasis”** – these are informal, *optional* water stops typically staffed by friendly volunteers (often local cycling clubs or community groups) . An oasis might be a pop-up tent where volunteers hand out water and maybe snacks like pickles or cookies. They’re not guaranteed, but the course map will note if an oasis is planned (e.g. in 2025 an oasis was at mile 25.5 providing sunscreen and water ). Riders aren’t required to stop at oases, but many do, if only to enjoy the hospitality or a quick bottle top-up .

Additionally, the courses deliberately route through a few **small towns** where there are **convenience stores** (gas stations). These are part of the *self-support* plan – riders can stop and **buy food/drinks** as needed . In fact, on the 150mi course you usually hit ~2 little towns (maybe around mile 30–40 and again around mile 80–100) . Many riders take advantage of Casey’s General Store or local gas stations to grab cold drinks, ice, or a snack. Gravel Worlds encourages supporting the local communities – they note that over the years, riders buying snacks have helped fund local causes (like a Boy Scout troop or a town baseball field) . They remind everyone: *“BRING CASH!”* if you plan to shop at these rural stores  (cards usually work too, but small purchases are easier with a few dollars on hand).

**“If you think you need it, bring it.”** That’s a mantra repeated by the organizers . Because outside support is prohibited and aid stations are spaced far apart, you should **start fully stocked** with what you’ll require for each leg. Elite racers might carry minimal weight and rely on the checkpoints, but most riders carry plenty of water (often 3+ bottles or a hydration pack), enough nutrition for 50+ miles, and tools/tubes. Remember, especially in the 300-mile, the *only* guaranteed aid might be gas stations roughly every 50 miles . The **300mi Long Voyage** is billed as *“100% self-supported, the only oasis riders will find… [are] public gas stations and water stops provided”* . Indeed, 300mi participants have to be very self-reliant, riding all night with no sag wagons. One Long Voyage finisher recounted that *“the occasional gas station was our only resupply opportunity”* – they skipped the first one at mile 45 and didn’t stop until mile 84, making for a very long haul between water refills . In his case, he learned a valuable lesson watching experienced riders **fill bottles from the sink/fountain** inside the gas station instead of wasting time buying drinks – every minute counts in a self-supported race  .

**No Personal Support:** To be clear, you **cannot receive aid from your friends or family** during the race. Support crews are welcome to cheer at the finish, but they can’t drive out on course to hand you bottles or fix your bike. Likewise, team cars (common in pro road racing) are not present here – **“no team vehicles or handups”** is enforced . The only assistance allowed is **peer-to-peer between riders**: if another participant gives you a CO2 cartridge or a gel, that’s fine (it’s even encouraged in the spirit of gravel). But no outside SAG. Gravel Worlds started as a pirate-inspired, grassroots adventure and they maintain that ethos even as it has grown – *“the event maintains its self-supported format… staying true to its grassroots origins despite the $100k prize purse”* .

To summarize, **Gravel Worlds = self-sufficiency**. Riders must plan their nutrition and hydration between aid stations, carry appropriate tools, and be prepared to solve problems on their own. There is support on course (water, food, mechanical help at checkpoints), but it’s limited. This is intentional – it keeps the event honest and tough. As the organizers like to say, *“If you need it, bring it”* . And if you find yourself in trouble, rely on the gravel community spirit: help a fellow rider if you can, and hope they’ll do the same for you. That’s the pirate code out there on the gravel seas!

**REDDIT THREADS**

The gravel cycling community on Reddit has plenty of firsthand accounts and advice about Gravel Worlds. Here are a few key insights and quotes surfaced from Reddit discussions:
	•	**Nebraska Rollers Galore:** In one thread, a Nebraskan commented on the constant hills: *“I did the 75 [mile] last year… I forgot about the* ***relentless rolling hills*** *– I felt like I was doing intervals for 4 hours”* . Another local chimed in agreement: *“Yeah, I’m a Nebraska resident and that’s exactly how I describe riding the hills –* ***mandatory intervals.*** *At least I’m used to it!”* . These comments underscore how the short, steep rollers in the Lincoln area force repeated hard efforts, even on the “short” 75mi course. It’s a common theme: out-of-state riders are often surprised at how unceasing the hills are. No long climbs, but zero flat recovery – a Redditor quipped that either you’re grinding uphill or bombing down, so your legs never get a true break.
	•	**Heat and Humility:** Discussion of the weather pops up frequently. Ahead of 2022’s race, one user noted they were hoping for a cooler day, and another replied that 2021 had been brutal with heat indices over 100°F. After the 2024 event, a user recap simply stated: *“Omg it was so* ***hot****… Heat index was 105+. … The heat got me hard so I chilled for a while at stops. I’m guessing a lot of DNFs.”* . This person went on to describe how they had to rest in the shade twice and significantly slowed down, taking over 13 hours total, but was *“damn happy to finish with how hard it was.”* . Such anecdotes on r/gravelcycling emphasize that even experienced riders get humbled by the Nebraska sun. Several threads advise newcomers to **pace conservatively** if it’s a hot forecast, and to take advantage of every water refill. As one Redditor put it, “Don’t try to be a hero if it’s 100°F – Gravel Worlds will be there next year, but only if you survive this one!”
	•	**Mental Challenge:** The mental aspect of an ultra-gravel race is a frequent topic. One memorable comment came from a rider comparing Gravel Worlds to the more famous Unbound: *“Never experienced hills like that… Those hills were* ***harder than Unbound****.”*  They noted that the constant up-down in Nebraska wore on them more than the longer, steadier Kansas climbs of Unbound. Another Reddit user who attempted the 300-mile “Long Voyage” was asked what the hardest part was; their answer was essentially the **mental battle** of continuing through the second night. Pushing through fatigue, darkness, and loneliness on those gravel roads tests one’s resolve. Users have described having “dark moments” at mile 120 or 130 of the 150, where they badly wanted to quit, only to rebound after an aid station or a caffeine gel. The consensus from Reddit: expect some mental lows and plan strategies to get through them (whether that’s a favorite snack as a reward, some music for the lonely stretches, or recalling your motivation for doing this). Gravel Worlds is as much a **mental endurance** test as a physical one, especially when you hit the back half of the race with 100+ miles in your legs, the sun beating down, and miles of gravel still to go.
	•	**Self-Support Tips:** Redditors also swap advice on the self-supported aspect. In one r/gravelcycling thread, a user emphasized: *“Plan on being entirely* ***self-supported****. That means bring what you need and know how to fix your bike.”* . People shared tips like carrying a spare derailleur hanger, extra hydration in a camelbak, and even a small battery pack if using navigation on your phone. A few Nebraska locals noted that the convenience stores on course can save your race – *“Don’t skip the gas station stops, even if you feel good. Top off your bottles and maybe get some cold Coke – you’ll thank yourself an hour later.”* The prevalent attitude is that while Gravel Worlds has some aid, riders should approach it with a **bikepacking mindset**: be prepared for anything. One Reddit user humorously wrote that they carried a mini pharmacy (salt tabs, ibuprofen, Tums) and “probably enough tools to build a bike from scratch” – and of course used none of it – but knowing it was there kept them calm. Others highlighted the importance of **route familiarity**: if you can, drive or pre-ride parts of the course (the first 20 miles, etc.) to know what’s coming – but many acknowledged that with the route only published shortly before the race, that’s not always feasible for out-of-towners.
	•	**Community and Vibe:** Many Reddit posts praise the Gravel Worlds organizers and vibe. *“Jason, Cory and the Gravel Worlds gang are an awesome group,”* one user wrote, *“their event is great too.”*  Another called it *“such a fun race… the group that runs it is awesome!”* . First-time racers often remark on how encouraging the atmosphere is – e.g. faster riders yelling “good job” to others, locals sitting in lawn chairs cheering in tiny farm towns, and the joyful pirate-themed touches (like volunteers in pirate hats). A Reddit recap of the finish said: “They make even the last finishers feel like rockstars.” This supportive “gravel family” vibe consistently shines through in social media threads about Gravel Worlds.

In summary, Reddit conversations reinforce key points: **expect punishing hills and heat, be ready to self-support, and remember that it’s okay to suffer – everyone is.** But they also highlight the camaraderie and positive spirit that make Gravel Worlds special. As one redditor succinctly put it when asked how Gravel Worlds was: *“It hurt like hell, but I’d do it again.”* And that seems to be the prevailing sentiment in the online gravel community.

**TRAINERROAD FORUM**

The TrainerRoad forum (a popular cycling training community) has a dedicated thread discussing “The Nebraska Garmin Gravel Worlds 2024” which provides some valuable first-hand reports and preparation tips  . Key takeaways from that discussion include:
	•	**Aero Bars & Wind:** Members debated equipment choices like using aerobars. Given Nebraska’s potential winds and the solo time one might spend, the consensus was that **aero bars can be beneficial** for the 150-mile, as long as you use them safely. One coach noted, *“150mi is a long day… If [it’s] windy [you’ll] probably wish you had them”* . Another user confirmed Gravel Worlds has **no ban on aerobars** (just the common-sense restriction of not using them in tight groups for safety). The advice was: if you’re comfortable with aerobars and expect long stretches riding solo (or into headwind), bring them. Just remember the event rule: hands on the base bar when in a pack .
	•	**Training for Long Duration:** People shared training approaches for a 150-mile gravel race. Many recommended doing at least one or two **century+ distance rides** on similar terrain beforehand. TrainerRoad users stressed long endurance rides and heat acclimation. One person mentioned they did back-to-back long rides on weekends to simulate riding on tired legs. Another emphasized **climbing repeats** or over/unders to mimic the constant rolling hills (so your body gets used to repeated hard efforts with little recovery). A coach on the forum suggested targeting the ability to ride 10-12 hours at a moderate pace, since most non-pros will be out there all day. Nutrition strategy came up too: practice taking in 60-90g of carbs per hour and **figure out solid foods** that sit well in your stomach (because gels alone for 12 hours can be rough). Essentially, the TrainerRoad crowd treats Gravel Worlds like an “ultra-endurance event” – training the aerobic base heavily and dialing in fueling/hydration.
	•	**Race Reports – Reality Check:** Perhaps the most insightful posts were the **post-race reports**. After the 2024 race, user “KCBikeNerd” gave a detailed account  . He punctured a tire at mile 30 which cost time, then battled a brutal headwind from mile 60 onward, got stung by a wasp around mile 80, and was *“cooked”* by the heat by mile 100. He mentioned having to sit in the shade at aid stations to cool down. His moving time was ~10h52m, but total time was ~13h20m due to stopping – showing how much non-moving time can accumulate when conditions are tough . Despite being an experienced gravel racer, he said *“I hurt lol… it was so hot… route was brutal.* ***Never flat*** *with loose pea gravel.”*  . Significantly, he noted **97/150 finished** in the 150mi that year, reinforcing how high the DNF rate was . His advice for “next time” was telling: he would use **more chamois cream**, and carry a **small sunscreen** to reapply (he got a bit sunburned) . These little details (saddle comfort and sun protection) often get overlooked but become critical over such a long day – a great lesson from someone who endured it.
	•	**Attendance and Trends:** Another discussion on the forum analyzed participation trends: the event peaked in 2022 with about 1,600 finishers, then dropped in 2023–24 . Theories ranged from the **calendar** (competition with SBT GRVL one week prior, fatigue in the gravel calendar by late August) to the extreme weather causing DNS/DNF. One user pointed out that **75-mile participation** is usually larger than 150-mile – many riders opt for the shorter challenge . The forum agreed that 2024’s drop was likely an outlier due to the heat, and that Gravel Worlds still remains a premier event albeit smaller than Unbound. TrainerRoad folks seemed confident that with its organization and unique vibe, Gravel Worlds would continue to attract a solid field (especially with the new pro prize purse drawing elites).
	•	**Comparison to Unbound:** A thread question specifically asked how Gravel Worlds compares to Unbound 200. Respondents highlighted a few differences:
	•	**Distance** – GW 150 is shorter (by ~50 miles) but still very hard due to terrain. Many said *“don’t underestimate it; 150 in Nebraska can feel as hard as 200 in Kansas.”*
	•	**Terrain** – Unbound has flint rocks and some longer climbs; GW has friendlier gravel (less tire slashing) but more frequent hills. One TR user who did both commented that GW’s **“hills were harder than Unbound’s”** – likely referencing the relentlessness .
	•	**Support** – both are self-supported, but Emporia’s Unbound has huge crowds and spectacle, whereas Lincoln’s event is a bit smaller scale and more “grassroots family reunion” in feel.
	•	**Logistics** – Lincoln is a bigger city with more amenities (easier hotel access, etc.) compared to Emporia, which forum members noted as a nice convenience.

Overall, the TrainerRoad forum provided a blend of **practical advice** (train long, heat acclimate, use aero if windy, lube and sunscreen!) and **personal anecdotes** reinforcing that Gravel Worlds is a formidable challenge. The key messages align with what we see elsewhere: you must respect the course and conditions, and go in with a smart plan, but also be ready to adjust on the fly. As KCBikeNerd concluded about 2024: *“It was real rough… but I’d do it again though.”*  That pretty much sums it up – it’s brutal, yet people can’t wait to come back.

**YOUTUBE RACE REPORTS**

A number of racers and media have documented their Gravel Worlds experiences on YouTube, providing a visceral look at the event. These **race report videos** highlight both the challenges and the atmosphere:
	•	**2025 “Corn, Mud, & $100,000 Showdown” (Russell Finsterwald’s video):** Pro racer Russell Finsterwald released a popular recap titled *“Gravel Worlds 2025: Corn, Mud & a $100,000 Showdown in Nebraska.”* The video shows on-bike footage of the **muddy carnage** in 2025 when overnight rain turned sections of the course into a peanut-butter mess. Finsterwald narrates how the lead group had to trudge through sticky mud in several Minimum Maintenance Road segments, turning bikes into 40-lb mud anchors. He captures the moment one competitor’s derailleur got clogged and snapped – illustrating how quickly a race can unravel. Then, as the mud gave way to fast dry gravel, the video shows **intense paceline racing** among the front runners, culminating in a sprint finish (with Matt Beers narrowly beating Keegan Swenson, as also reported elsewhere  ). Finsterwald notes the contrast of **Nebraska cornfields and brutal conditions** – at one point he says “You think Iowa has gravel? Nebraska has *all* the gravel and it will rip your legs off if you’re not careful.” The footage of riders cresting roller after roller really drives home how *constant* the hills are. And the “$100k showdown” aspect underlined how competitive the front of the race has become, with international pros flying in, yet in the same video you see age-group riders grinding determinedly – a nice illustration of Gravel Worlds’ mix of elite and amateur.
	•	**2025 Muddy Chaos (Drew Dillman’s vlog):** Gravel racer (and YouTuber) Drew Dillman posted *“Muddy Chaos at 2025 Gravel Worlds Pro Men’s Race.”* His perspective is from within the lead pack. He describes that during the first mud sector, *“it was mayhem – guys were running with bikes, mud everywhere, literally* ***chain-clogging mud****”* similar to what written reports said . Dillman had to stop multiple times to clear mud from his frame. The video shows him and others using sticks to scrape mud off and pouring water on derailleurs. He mentions that after surviving the mud, the race essentially restarted with a smaller lead group. The second half of his video, once the course dried up, shows classic Nebraska gravel scenes: long stretches of **rolling white gravel roads under a blazing sun**, with very few trees around. You can see dust clouds trailing the riders – a reminder that when it’s not muddy, it’s often dusty. Dillman also points out the strategic element of **limited water stops**; he made a point to refill at an oasis while some others skipped, and later some of those who skipped ran out of water in the heat.
	•	**2022 Race Report (Outdoor Discussion channel):** An amateur team (“An Outdoor Discussion”) made a video race report for **2022 Gravel Worlds**. In it, two OBED Bikes ambassadors document their entire day. They start at dawn in Lincoln with drone shots of the starting line – showing hundreds of riders gathered, the pirate flag flying, etc. They talk through their strategy: one mentions he carried a 3-liter hydration pack plus two bottles because of the heat forecast. On course, their GoPro footage shows the **scenery**: gently rolling hills with combines in the fields, gravel stretching to the horizon. They also capture a few **support points** – e.g. footage at a gas station stop where a bunch of cyclists are crammed outside a rural convenience store chugging Gatorades and Cokes. The video notes “it reached 98°F by mid-day” and you can see salt stains on their kits. In their commentary, one says *“I was* ***cooked by mile 100****. If not for the kindness of some locals with a hose, I don’t know if I’d have made it.”* Apparently some residents along the course set up sprinklers or hoses to spray passing riders (a lovely unofficial aid on hot years). The video’s latter part shows them finishing around sunset, completely exhausted but ecstatic. They emphasize the **accomplishment** of finishing – one says it was the hardest thing he’s ever done on a bike, even more than his previous Ironman, because the gravel hills just never let up.
	•	**2018 Gravel Worlds (Gravelcyclist.com video):** JOM of GravelCyclist has a YouTube channel and did a piece on **2018’s Gravel Worlds** (the “87 hills” year). His video is more of a narrative with photos and commentary. He highlights the **community vibe** – showing the Thursday night meet & greet, people swapping stories at the brewery, etc. During the race, he had a camera and took shots of groups of riders pacelining over the rollers. A memorable segment is drone footage he included, which pans over the **sea of rolling hills** dotted with cyclists – visually confirming how hilly and exposed the course is. JOM narrates how he suffered in the heat (he was a Florida rider not used to such sustained climbing). He also shows the finish line scene, where the Pirate Cycling League awards were given: the overall winners got their pirate swords and “championship jerseys”, and a crowd in pirate costumes cheered wildly. He noted that the organizers gave shout-outs to random finishers too, e.g. “Here comes so-and-so from Texas, completing his first Gravel Worlds!” – illustrating the personal touch and celebration of everyone.
	•	**Miscellaneous Tips from Videos:** A few other YouTubers (like “Back of the Pack” cycling) have videos where they share *tips for Gravel Worlds*. Common advice echoed: **bring lights** if doing the 300 (you’ll ride through a full night), use **fast-rolling tires** (Nebraska gravel doesn’t require big knobs, but stability in loose gravel is important), and make sure your **bike is in tip-top shape** (many have DNF’d due to mechanicals like broken derailleur hangers or fried bottom brackets from mud). One tip from a 2021 video: carry a small bottle of chain lube in your flat kit – after dusty or muddy sections your drivetrain will thank you.

In summary, the YouTube race reports put imagery to what all the reports describe: **riders cresting endless hills in blistering sun**, caked in dust or mud, pushing themselves to the limit. They also capture the spirit – e.g., footage of volunteers in pirate garb handing out water, or exhausted finishers hugging with smiles and finisher medals. These videos confirm that Gravel Worlds is an *epic ultra-distance challenge* with tough conditions, but also a fun, quirky, community-driven event. As one video intro aptly said: *“Gravel, mud, and some of the toughest athletes in the country. Welcome to Gravel Worlds!”* .

**RACE REPORTS & BLOGS**

Numerous riders have written detailed race reports and blog posts about their Gravel Worlds experience, often providing deep insight and helpful details. Here are highlights from a few such reports:
	•	**“150 Hot Miles… and 87 Hills” (2018, GravelCyclist.com):** Jayson O’Mahoney (JOM) wrote a colorful race report titled *“150 Hot Miles of the 2018 Gravel Worlds… and about 87 hills”* . His account gives a great feel for the event logistics and terrain. Notably, he mentions *“someone remarked there were 87 hills along the full 150-mile course.”*  He, coming from flat Florida, had done *“zero hill training”* and jokingly wondered what could go wrong – indeed he suffered on those never-ending rollers  . His blog also describes the travel and **Lincoln hospitality**: he flew into Omaha, drove to Lincoln, attended the Thursday night meet & greet at a local tap house, and was hosted by friendly local cyclists  . He commented on how welcoming Corey and Craig (the Pirate Cycling League founders) were in person. During the race, JOM battled the *“deep sections of gravel”* and noted the roads were in *“primo condition”* aside from loose pockets . He wrote that the Nebraska hills *“hold not even a flicker of a candle”* to anything in Florida – a wake-up call for him . His race report underscores: bring low enough gearing for the climbs! (He mentioned one of his friends chose a road racing crank (50/34) with a tight cassette, which is doable but leaves little relief on steep pitches ). In the end, he finished mid-pack, utterly exhausted and parched, but he praised the event organization and atmosphere. His final paragraphs give shout-outs to the community, and he noted his friend Bobby (a newbie) somehow finished his first 150 – albeit thinking it was insane to pick Gravel Worlds as a first gravel event .
	•	**Designs by Conor – “Gravel Worlds: The Long Voyage” (2023):** Conor O’Brian wrote a fantastic blog about his experience doing the **300-mile Long Voyage** in 2023, where he impressively took 2nd place . This report really illuminates the *ultra-endurance* aspect. He recounts starting at 5pm Friday in **95°F heat** alongside ~100 other crazies . By sunset (~60 miles in), the field had whittled to 9 leaders and they switched on headlamps as darkness fell . Conor emphasizes the *self-supported* nature: *“In this self-supported race, the occasional gas station was our only resupply.”*  He details how their lead group skipped the first station at mile 45 and didn’t stop until mile 84, which became a critical learning moment for him. At that gas station, he made a *tactical error* – he bought bottles of water and M&Ms at the register, whereas his competitors **filled their bottles in the sink and left quickly**  . By the time he paid and got outside, the others were gone, and he had *“lost the group”* . He describes a dramatic solo chase in the dark, pushing slightly above comfort to reel them back in over ~15 miles, which he did by around mile 100  . This section of his narrative highlights the *mental toughness* required – he had to stay calm and execute a plan not to let the race slip away after a small mistake. Conor also notes the benefit of his bike’s **gearing**: he ran a 2x road gearing (50/34 chainrings) which let him *“carry speed through the endlessly rolling terrain better than most… [others] on 1x drivetrains.”*  It’s a neat insight: having tighter gear steps helped him on Nebraska’s constant rollers, an equipment choice that paid off. He goes on to describe the surreal experience of riding through the second half of the night, the group of 5 chatting at times to keep awake, etc. As dawn of Saturday arrived, some riders dropped off, and by sunrise it was a battle of four for the podium. Conor ultimately finished around 19.5 hours, utterly spent but elated . His closing thoughts: it was *“a cycling experience I’ll never forget”*, combining physical endurance, strategy, and the simple joy of seeing the sun come up over gravel roads after riding all night . For anyone considering the Long Voyage, his blog is a must-read – it stresses being efficient in stops, riding within yourself at night, and the importance of group collaboration (and how easily you can lose that benefit if you’re not quick!).
	•	**Carey Lowery’s 2017 Report:** (Carey Lowery is an endurance racer who blogged a **2017 Gravel Worlds** report). She writes from the perspective of a competitive Masters woman. A key point she made was the **wind** that year – a stiff south wind made the first half (heading south out of Lincoln) brutally hard. She latched onto small groups for drafting when possible, but many sections were just grind-it-out. She vividly describes **“the heat radiating off the gravel”** and how she combated it with ice socks at checkpoints. Interestingly, she mentioned the **pirate theme fun**: e.g. volunteers in pirate costumes handing out ice pops at one oasis, which boosted her spirits. Carey’s report also praises the **women’s field camaraderie** – they treated it as a race but also helped each other, with stronger riders offering encouragement to others to keep pushing in the final miles. In the end, she won her Masters category and described holding the pirate sword trophy as one of her proudest moments. Her advice was to **manage your pace early** (“it’s easy to go out too hard chasing faster wheels on those early hills”) and **stay on top of nutrition** (she nearly bonked at mile 120 but a Coke and Snickers from a gas station saved her).
	•	**OBED Bikes “Race Recap: Gravel Worlds Nebraska” (2022):** This is a blog from bike brand OBED following two amateur racers in 2022 . They recount the major story of that year: a **rainstorm at the start turning the course to mud, followed by extreme heat later**. They describe the first 10 miles as a mud-fest where many had to carry bikes, then conditions dried and it became steamy. One ambassador actually quit at mile 100 due to heat exhaustion, while the other persevered to finish just under the cutoff. The recap highlighted **how unpredictable Gravel Worlds can be** – you might face both mud and heat in one day. They also gave props to the organizers for quickly re-routing a tiny part of the course that became unrideable (a flooded creek crossing) – within an hour they had volunteers redirect riders safely. The OBED riders mentioned **tire choice**: one ran 700x40c semi-slicks which were great on dry gravel but absolutely packed with mud in the wet parts, making his bike 10 lbs heavier; the other ran 45mm knobbier tires which shed mud better early on but were slower later. A takeaway: there’s no perfect setup for wildly variable conditions, so choose what suits the forecast and accept compromises.

Each of these race reports, though from different years and perspectives (pro vs amateur, 150 vs 300, male vs female), all emphasize a few common themes: **the hills, the heat, the wind, and the importance of strategy and self-reliance.** They also invariably mention the **unique spirit** of Gravel Worlds – whether it’s the pirate lore, the friendly volunteers, or the fact that you might be racing alongside WorldTour pros and weekend warriors together.

One line from JOM’s 2018 report sticks out as a good summary: *“Gravel Worlds…a much bigger challenge [than local gravel], both in length and the never-ending hills.”*  Yet people return year after year, drawn to that challenge and the grassroots camaraderie. Reading these blogs truly gives you a respect for anyone who earns a Gravel Worlds finisher’s patch – it is **earned** the hard way, through heat, dust, sweat, and sheer willpower.

**MEDIA COVERAGE**

Gravel Worlds has garnered increasing coverage in cycling media as it’s grown. Outlets like VeloNews, CyclingTips, and local news have written about the event’s evolution, competitive storylines, and its place in gravel racing. Here are some highlights from media coverage:
	•	**VeloNews (Outside) – Race Reports:** VeloNews routinely reports on the race outcomes. For example, in 2023 they ran a piece titled “Lauren Stephens and John Borstelmann are the 2023 Gravel Worlds champions,” noting Borstelmann’s three-peat win . They highlighted that year’s dynamic: Stephens, a pro road sprinter, taking the women’s title in a sprint after 150 miles – underlining the depth of field Gravel Worlds now draws. In **2025**, Slowtwitch (and other outlets under Outside) covered the dramatic pro race: Matthew Beers (South Africa) outsprinting defending champ Keegan Swenson in the men’s 150  , and an article on the women’s side with Rosa Klōser’s breakaway win . Media reports emphasized the *record prize purse* of $100k in 2025 (calling it “what’s believed to be the largest ever in gravel” at that time) , marking how Gravel Worlds went big to attract elite racers. However, those articles also note the **gnarly conditions**: a late rain turned sections into mud and caused crashes and mechanicals that impacted the pro race  . So the media narrative was: Gravel Worlds is stepping onto the world stage of gravel (with big prize money and international talent), yet it remains an *unforgiving grassroots* race where Mother Nature can upend the favorites.
	•	**CyclingTips (before merger):** CyclingTips did a profile around 2021 when Gravel Worlds added the 300-mile Long Voyage. They quoted the organizers about keeping the grassroots feel while innovating (the 300 was a novel addition then, offering something even Unbound didn’t have at the time). An interesting tidbit: Corey Godfrey (co-founder) said the idea of “Gravel Worlds” started tongue-in-cheek in the late 2000s because gravel wasn’t mainstream – it was like, “we’ll host our own Worlds since no one else cares.” Now of course, there’s an official UCI Gravel Worlds, but Lincoln’s event predates and deliberately calls itself **“the pirate version”** or *“Garmin Gravel Worlds”* (with Garmin/Lauf as sponsors, since they can’t legally use “World Championships”). Media often clarify that distinction: this is *not* the UCI Worlds, but rather a beloved grassroots race with a playful name that has become legitimately international.
	•	**Local News – Lincoln Journal Star / 1011 NOW:** Local media in Nebraska cover Gravel Worlds as a point of pride. A 2021 local TV piece noted *“Gravel Worlds is taking over northeast Lincoln and roads around the county”* , with footage of hundreds of riders rolling out at sunrise. Local articles often emphasize the **economic impact** (e.g. $2 million influx in 2025, hotels filled, restaurants busy) , and how Lincoln has embraced being a “gravel destination.” One local article even interviewed farmers who live along the course – one said he used to think cyclists on gravel were crazy, but now each year he sets up a water station at the end of his driveway because he enjoys the event. It’s a great story of community embrace. The **Elevation Outdoors** magazine did a 2025 feature called *“Beyond the Sea of Red: How Lincoln Became a Gravel Destination,”* noting that Lincoln leverages its large network of wide gravel roads and city amenities to create a unique event . It highlighted that Lincoln, known for Husker football, now also hosts a world-class gravel race that attracted ~1,500 athletes in 2025 . The article pointed out that while Emporia’s Unbound has ~5,000 riders, Lincoln offers more infrastructure and still maintains authenticity  . It also mentioned Gravel Worlds’ **“Gravel Family”** culture of inclusivity and things like the DFL champagne tradition .
	•	**Gravel Worlds in the Context of Gravel Racing:** Media stories often compare Gravel Worlds with other marquee gravel events. It’s frequently mentioned in the same breath as Unbound (200 miles, Kansas) and SBT GRVL (Steamboat). In previews for the season, Gravel Worlds is listed as a late-August challenge that many pros target after Leadville or Steamboat. VeloNews in 2022 did a piece about the “Gravel Grand Prix” series and noted that although Gravel Worlds wasn’t part of that series, a lot of top racers still did Gravel Worlds for the experience and to claim the unofficial “world title” (at least a pirate sword trophy world title!). There’s an undercurrent in media of Gravel Worlds being a bit of a *rebel/alternative* to the highly commercialized races – true to its Pirate Cycling League roots. The **Velominati** blog back in 2013 called it *“a true world championship for the crazy gravel tribe”* (albeit tongue-in-cheek) and loved that its rulebook was basically just “don’t be a jerk”  .
	•	**Human Interest Stories:** Some media coverage focuses on personal achievements at Gravel Worlds. For instance, there have been pieces on para-cyclist athletes competing (Gravel Worlds added para categories in recent years ). In 2022, a local piece profiled a visually-impaired tandem team taking on the 150. Another feel-good story: the **“1000 Women of Gravel” initiative in 2022**, which Gravel Worlds promoted to get more women into gravel racing (they succeeded – over 1,000 female participants across events, a huge jump). Jason Strohbehn (promoter) was quoted saying this effort made the community stronger and they awarded a special prize to the 1000th female registrant.
	•	**Post-Event Press Releases:** The Gravel Worlds website itself posts news (which media sometimes quote). For example, a press release for 2025 noted *“riders from six continents and nearly every state”* converging in Lincoln , and it emphasized the event’s charitable side – Gravel Worlds Foundation raising $100k for nonprofits in 2025 . Media often pick up on these stats to show it’s not just a race but an event with global draw and community impact.

In essence, media coverage paints Gravel Worlds as **one of the premier gravel races** in the U.S., mixing grassroots authenticity with an increasingly professional field. It’s portrayed as brutally challenging (the tales of heat, mud, and endless hills now legendary) but also uniquely fun (pirate swords and inclusive vibes). The press agrees that Gravel Worlds has “come of age” – no longer an underground event, it’s now a cornerstone of the gravel calendar. Yet it hasn’t lost its soul, which media find refreshing. As Elevation Outdoors put it, Gravel Worlds has *“evolved into a globally recognized championship while maintaining its grassroots authenticity.”*  .

**RESULTS & DNF DATA**

**Winners and Records:** Gravel Worlds keeps a “History/Results” archive of champions. Recent winning times for the 150-mile are staggeringly fast – on the order of **6.5–8 hours** for men and **7.5–9 hours** for women, depending on conditions  . For example, 2024 saw a men’s course record of 6:48:46 by Simen Nordahl Svendsen , and Lauren Stephens winning women in 7:57 (back-to-back wins for her) . In 2025, Matt Beers won men in 6:58 and Rosa Klöser won women in 7:57 . The fact that ~7 hours won the women’s race both years hints that sub-8 is an elite benchmark for 150mi in good conditions. The non-binary category is newer; in 2024 Sam Hansen won in ~12:10 (they might have treated it more recreationally) . Para and tandem categories also have their champions listed, often taking 10+ hours. The **300-mile Long Voyage** winning times are mind-blowing – e.g. 2024 Luke Hall finished in 15:40 (which is ~19.3 mph average over 300 miles!) . 2023 winners were around 18.5 and 22.5 hours for men/women 300mi , and 2022 Colin Patterson did 17:21 (the first year it was run) . These are **ultra-endurance feats** – many 300mi finishers ride through a second sunset.

**Finisher Rates:** While exact finisher counts aren’t always published publicly, we can glean some data. In **2024**, as discussed, only **97 of ~150** who started the 150-mile finished (≈65% finish rate) due to heat  . But that year was exceptionally tough. In more average years, the finish rate for 150mi might be around 75-80%. Many who DNF often pull out at checkpoints or get a ride back if overheated. The 75-mile has a higher finish rate (shorter duration, more people treating it as a ride). Still, even the 75 isn’t easy – in a Reddit thread a user guessed there were also some DNFs in 75 due to heat in 2024 .

For overall participation: **2022** was big – according to a forum post, ~1600 finishers across all distances . That likely broke down to maybe ~500 in 150mi, ~800 in 75mi, and rest in 50k/35mi. **2023** had fewer due to extreme conditions and maybe conflicts – anecdotally perhaps ~1200 finishers total. **2024** had around 1000 finishers total . Not everyone who registers shows up (DNS), especially if weather looks bad or if they over-committed. For example, one user said **250-300 had originally signed up for 150 in 2024, but many downgraded or DNS, leaving ~150 starters**  .

The **DNF rate** on the 300-miler is naturally high. In its inaugural 2021, only a handful out of ~30 starters finished (the rest scratched along the way). By 2023, the 300 had more like 100 starters, but still many don’t make it within the 30-hour limit. Finishing the Long Voyage is truly a feat – those who do earn a custom belt buckle and serious bragging rights.

**Notable DNFs:** Even elite riders have fallen victim. For instance, gravel pro Keegan Swenson (generally dominant in many races) **DNF’d in 2021** due to heat or mechanical issues, if memory serves. Laurens ten Dam, a WorldTour veteran, attempted Gravel Worlds one year and cracked in the heat around mile 100. The Pirate Cycling League ethos is *“it’s only failure if you never come back”* – they encourage those who DNF to treat it as a learning experience and try again . One Facebook comment noted over 50% DNF in the Long Voyage’s first edition – and an old-timer saying it took him 10 tries to finally finish (which he did, illustrating persistence) .

**Age Group and Other Categories:** Gravel Worlds gives out awards for many age groups (every 10-year bracket, plus singlespeed, fatbike, tandem, etc.). The results show that older riders absolutely finish this race – e.g. in 2022, the 60-69 age group winners finished ~12-13 hours . This is inspiring data for masters athletes. The tandem category is small but a couple tandems usually tackle the 150 (imagine doing those washboard hills on a tandem – communication and strong stoker legs required!).

**Cutoff Enforcements:** The intermediate checkpoint cutoffs do account for some DNFs. If you miss CP2 by ~6:30pm, you’re done – the crew will pick you up. The finish line cutoff (10pm) is somewhat soft in that they won’t shut down the finish immediately, but official timing stops. In 2024, the finish rate improved a bit *because* so many slower riders had preemptively switched to 75mi. A forum post analyzing data said the overall finish rate was actually better in 2024 than prior years, but that was misleading because a chunk of would-be 150mi DNFs just didn’t start that distance . So the data can be skewed by who starts.

**2025 Expectations:** With the new pro field and prize money, 2025 saw more DNFs at the pointy end due to taking risks. For example, some Euro pros came and blew up in the heat or got lost on unmarked turns (navigation error = time lost). But the mid-pack in 2025 enjoyed relatively mild weather (compared to 2024), so we might see an uptick in finishers. The press release said 2025 had participants from 18 countries, showing the depth.

In summary, the results data shows **Gravel Worlds is very finishable but not guaranteed**. Roughly 2/3 to 3/4 of 150-mile starters finish in a typical year (conditions swinging that a lot). Those who do finish post times anywhere from ~7 hours (winners) to 15.5 hours (the last official finisher, often rolling in just before or at cutoff). The DNF stories often boil down to: *heat exhaustion, dehydration, time cutoffs, or mechanical failure.* It’s telling that even experienced gravel racers approach Gravel Worlds with respect. As one finisher said in a results comment, *“I suffered more in the heat and hills of Nebraska than I did at [Unbound].”*  But completing it earns you serious gravel glory. And if not, well, you learn and come back stronger – the “Gravel Seas” will be waiting.

**SUFFERING ZONES**

While the entire 150 miles of Gravel Worlds can be a suffer-fest, riders consistently point out a few specific “crucible” segments – parts of the course or day that really break people. Think of these as the **“suffering zones”** of Gravel Worlds:
	•	**Midday Furnace (Miles 60–110):** By most accounts, the hardest stretch tends to be the **middle of the race**, roughly from the second checkpoint onward (or between CP1 and CP2). Here’s why: by mile ~60 you’ve already been riding 4-5 hours and the sun is high. From mile 60 to 100+, you’re often heading back north or west toward Lincoln, *usually directly into the prevailing south wind*. This was infamously the case in 2024 – riders described miles 60–120 as *“right into a* ***furnace headwind****”* that felt like riding in a hair dryer . This combination of **peak heat (1–4pm)** and often a **headwind on exposed roads** absolutely decimates people. It’s during this phase that many slower competitors either fall far behind pace or decide to shorten at the 75mi finish (if they had that option). One experienced racer noted that *“it pretty much slaughtered the mid/tail end”* of the field when the afternoon headwind hit in 2024 . There’s also typically a long stretch here with **no shade** – no tree canopy, just open cornfields radiating heat. Everyone is suffering in their own private pain cave through this zone. You can often tell at mile 100 if a rider will make it or not; those who managed hydration and pacing will still have some fight, whereas others are cooked, cramping, or mentally cracked. The stretch from ~mile 90 to 110 (approach to CP2) is particularly notorious – it’s the **longest haul between aid** on the 150, and hitting a wall at mile 100 with 50 to go is demoralizing.
	•	**The Final 20 – False Flats into Lincoln:** Another reported “suffer zone” is the **last 10–20 miles**. Physically, one might assume the finish is near so it gets easier – not so. In 2018, for example, riders faced a series of what felt like endless false-flat climbs heading back into Lincoln. One blog called it *“the slow death march back to town”* – those gentle uphills on tired legs made 10 miles feel like 30. Compounding it, by late afternoon the wind can shift or storms can build. In some years, pop-up rain showers actually hit in the final hour. Imagine being utterly exhausted and then getting slammed by a surprise thunderstorm – it’s happened! Also, the excitement of possibly seeing Lincoln’s water tower on the horizon is tempered by the fact you might still have a few climbs left. Many riders run on fumes here; nutrition you ate at mile 100 is long gone and it can be hard to force more gels down. This is where **mental grit** really counts. People talk about *“smelling the barn”* in the last 10 miles – you know the finish is close, so you must push through any cramps or fatigue-related nausea and just keep the pedals turning. It’s common to see riders stretching on the side of the road or giving themselves pep talks in this segment. The suffering is almost over, but these final miles can feel interminable.
	•	**Minimum Maintenance Road (MMR) Sectors:** On years when conditions are bad, the **MMR (dirt) sections** become agony zones. In mud years (2023, 2025), those few miles of MMR turned into hike-a-bike – which can really destroy your rhythm and morale. One could argue these muddy stretches are the highest “suffer index”: you’re off the bike, shoes caked in mud, shouldering a 30-lb mud-laden bike, watching precious time tick away. It’s a different kind of suffering – more mental frustration and brute physical labor than cycling. Conversely, in dry years, MMRs can be **bone-rattling rough** (hard dried ruts) or soft sand. Either way, they often appear late in the course when you’re least equipped to handle surprises. People have said *“when I hit that last MMR around mile 130, I almost cried”* – legs cramping, then suddenly you have to muscle through a technical bit. So yes, MMRs are bite-sized suffer zones within the larger race.
	•	**Overnight in the 300-mile:** For Long Voyage participants, the **deep night hours (2am–5am)** are the ultimate suffer zone. This is when the field is most spread out; many 300mi riders find themselves *entirely alone in the dark*, somewhere in rural Nebraska under the stars, with over 200 miles in their legs and still 80+ to go. That is a profound physical and mental low point for most. Blogs from 300mi finishers mention hallucinating cows or mailboxes as people, experiencing micro-sleeps, and needing to stop at a closed gas station just to lie down for 10 minutes. The temperature can drop at night, so now you’re exhausted, slightly chilled, and your body wants to quit. Those who persist often say the “suffer-fest” magically lifted at dawn when the sky lightened – but those couple of hours before sunrise are truly dark (literally and figuratively). It’s in those overnight suffer zones that the Long Voyage earns its legendary status – as one rider put it, *“We all faced our demons out there in the dark.”*
	•	**Personal “Walls”:** It should be noted every rider’s suffer zone can be different depending on their conditioning. Some hit a wall at mile 80, some at 120. A commonly cited point is around **mile 120** for the 150-miler – that’s when even well-paced nutrition might run low and the realization of “30 miles to go” feels simultaneously close and far. If you haven’t been taking in enough calories, mile 120-130 is where the bonk can strike. Lots of folks mention the **“mile 127 climb”** (varies by year, but there’s often a memorable climb ~20 miles out) that just crushed them. For example, one year the course had a steep kicker at mile 128 that averaged 12% – many had to walk it, cursing the course designers for throwing that so late. So an individual’s worst moment might be there.

In conclusion, Gravel Worlds will make you suffer at some point – it’s just about guaranteed. The heat of early afternoon and the relentless wind & hills around mid-race stand out as the universally tough stretch for 150-milers . Then the final push home tests whatever is left in the tank. Smart racers know these “crisis moments” are coming and plan for them – e.g. maybe you save a caffeinated gel for mile 100, or you deliberately back off the pace before the windy sections so you can handle them. The event is as much about **enduring the low points** as it is about enjoying the highs. A first-timer wrote afterwards, *“There was an hour I swore I’d never do this again. But by the finish, I forgot about the pain.”* That’s suffering at Gravel Worlds in a nutshell – temporary misery, eventual euphoria.

**EQUIPMENT CONSENSUS**

Riders at Gravel Worlds have over the years gravitated towards certain equipment choices that balance speed, durability, and comfort for the Nebraska gravel gauntlet. Here’s a rundown of the common gear setups and consensus:
	•	**Tires:** Perhaps the most discussed item. The local recommendation (and what many participants use) is **~40 mm gravel tires** with a file or semi-slick tread. The Gravel Worlds FAQ explicitly says *“we recommend tires 35mm or larger; 40+mm is very common”* among locals . Fast-rolling gravel tires like the Panaracer GravelKing SK or SS in 38–43c are popular – in fact the organizers note *“Gravel Kings are the go-to tire for the Gravel Worlds crew”* . Nebraska gravel “generally rolls pretty fast,” so you don’t need ultra aggressive knobs . What you do want is volume for comfort and stability in loose sections. Many top racers have run ~40mm slick or minimal tread (e.g. IRC Serac, Teravail Rutland) tubeless at low pressure to handle washboards. That said, in mud years, no tire is perfect – but a slightly wider tire at least won’t sink as much. **Tubeless** setup is almost universal; flats aren’t as common as Flint Hills of Kansas, but there are sharp rocks and lots of little “LeChunk” gravel that can poke holes, so self-sealing tubeless is key.
	•	**Bike Type:** Nearly everyone uses a dedicated **gravel bike** – drop bars, disc brakes, endurance geometry. There’s a mix of carbon and aluminum rigs. Some still rock steel or titanium for comfort. Hardtail mountain bikes are pretty rare (the course is mostly not technical enough to warrant them, and the speed penalty is big). A few riders have done it on cyclocross race bikes or even road bikes with big tire clearance, but the consensus is a gravel-specific bike is ideal for the wide range of surfaces. In 2025, many pros were on modern gravel race bikes (Specialized Diverge, Cervelo Aspero, Lauf Seigla, etc.). A notable sight in 2025 was **aero gear**: e.g. winner Matt Beers had aero deep-section wheels and even a rear disc wheel cover , which is unusual in gravel but shows the importance of aero in the winds. Some riders do bring **suspension**: the Lauf fork or Redshift stem/seatpost are seen to smooth the washboard. A few pros had RockShox Rudy suspension forks too. The consensus for an amateur would be: any reliable gravel bike you’re comfortable on for 8-15 hours, with gearing low enough for steep hills.
	•	**Drivetrain & Gearing:** Gearing is crucial given the hills. Many run **1x drivetrains** (e.g. 40T front, 10-44 or 10-50 cassette) for simplicity. But a notable subset prefer **2x** for more gear range and tighter cadence steps. As Conor’s 300mi report illustrated, he felt his 50/34 compact road crank + 11-34 cassette let him carry speed on rollers better than 1x folks . Pros and strong riders might be fine with 1x and bigger gaps, but mid-packers often appreciate a true granny gear. It’s not uncommon to see 2x setups with sub-1:1 ratios (e.g. 46/30 chainrings with 11-36 cassette) to save legs on the 15% grades. **Takeaway:** have a low gear around 1:1 or easier. Spin up those 87 hills rather than mash. Also, **double-check your equipment** – the long miles can shake loose things. Many people put fresh brake pads, new chain, and new tires before the race to minimize mechanical risk.
	•	**Hydration & Storage:** Because of the self-supported nature, bikes at Gravel Worlds are often decked out with extra storage. *“You’ll notice lots of big bottles on the bikes, along with additional storage for gels and nutrition,”* observed Slowtwitch in a bike gallery . Most riders use at least **2 large bottles**, and many add a third bottle (either on the frame or in a jersey pocket). Others use a **hydration backpack** or hip-pack, especially if it’s a scorcher. Top tube “bento” boxes for gels, frame bags for extra food, and feed bags (stem-mounted sacks) are all common sightings – basically a mini bikepacking setup. The goal is to carry enough to make it between aid stations without bonking or dehydrating. The 300-milers take this to another level: dynamo hub lights, aerobars, and even aero bars with attached feedbags, etc. But for 150mi, the sweet spot is usually **no huge packs** (to avoid heat burden) but rather 3 bottles + gels and maybe a small saddle bag for tools. Also, lots of riders tape a cue sheet or have the GPS route on a device – navigation is usually by GPS, so a reliable bike computer or phone in a mount is important.
	•	**Aero Bars:** A contentious topic. Aero bars **are allowed** at Gravel Worlds (just don’t use them in a group per safety rule) . Opinions vary: some swear by them for the headwinds and giving the hands a break; others don’t bother. You’ll typically see more aerobars on bikes in the 300-mile and among mid-to-back-pack 150mi riders who expect to ride solo. The front racers often forego them unless they’re really chasing marginal gains (some did use short clip-on aerobars in 2022 when it was part of a gravel series). If you use them, the rule and courtesy is to go aero when solo or pulling, but come out of aero when in a paceline. The general consensus: *If you anticipate long stretches alone or wind, aero bars can help a lot.* If you’re uncomfortable with them or plan to ride in groups, they might be unnecessary weight. It’s a personal call. But, interestingly, many locals do ride with clip-ons during training because Nebraska winds are no joke.
	•	**Lighting:** For the 150, usually not required (starts around sunrise ~6:30am and even a 15-hour finisher is done by 9:30pm daylight in August). But people have small blinky lights just in case of running late or rain-induced darkness. The 300mi absolutely requires good lights front and rear for overnight; those riders typically run dynamo or multiple battery lights.
	•	**Other Gear:** **Tubeless sealant and plugs** – nearly everyone carries a Dynaplug or bacon strips for quick flat fixes. A pair of **master link pliers** and a spare link – helpful given the mud can cause chain issues. **Chain lube** – a small bottle in the saddle bag if it’s dry and dusty (you might need to lube at 100mi) or after mud. **Chamois cream** – many apply at the start and some carry a packet to reapply mid-race (some checkpoint bags have free samples too). **Sun protection** – lots of riders wear a cap/neck gaiter or arm sleeves for sun, since the course is exposed. As one finisher said, he wished he had brought a small sunscreen to reapply on the move . **Comfort mods** like suspension stems/seatposts or bigger bar tape are popular to mitigate washboard vibration. And given the pirate theme, don’t be surprised to see bikes adorned with a Jolly Roger flag or a little pirate figurine zip-tied to the bars – a bit of fun flair is part of the Gravel Worlds spirit!

To illustrate a typical setup: In 2025 Slowtwitch profiled bikes of the pro men. Chase Wark’s Lauf Seigla had 45mm tires, aero bars, three bottle cages (including one between the aerobars), and a hydration bladder integrated on the frame  . Drew Dillman’s rig had 1L bottles and a top-tube bag for food . Cameron Jones ran 45mm semi-slicks and 3 bottle cages . These choices mirror what competitive amateurs do too.

**In short:** equip your bike for **comfort, reliability, and self-sufficiency**. Gravel Worlds will punish equipment that’s too fragile (imagine a light road wheel taco-ing on washboard – not good). Most riders strike a balance with robust wheels/tires, ample gearing, and enough on-bike storage to safely go 50+ miles between aid. It’s often said, *“Nothing new on race day.”* Gravel Worlds is not the place to test a brand-new unproven gadget – go with gear you’ve trained on and trust. As the event has grown more competitive, some are optimizing aero and weight, but 99% of folks would be wise to prioritize **puncture protection, gearing, and hydration capacity** over saving a few watts. After all, a flat or cramp will cost you more time than any aero gains. The consensus gear choices exist for a reason: they have been proven in the Nebraska gravel crucible.

**LOGISTICS**

Gravel Worlds might be a grueling adventure on course, but it’s one of the more logistically friendly big gravel events, thanks to its location in Lincoln and the organizers’ planning. Here’s what to know about logistics and the event vibe:
	•	**Location & Venue:** The race activities center around northwest Lincoln, Nebraska. In recent years the **Fallbrook area** (a neighborhood ~15 minutes from downtown) has hosted the expo and start/finish at the Sandhills Global Events Center  . This is convenient – it’s just off US-34 highway and there’s ample parking. Lincoln is a mid-sized city (~290k population metro), so it has all the amenities (hotels, restaurants, bike shops) one could need within close range. Many riders stay in hotels in Lincoln – there are dozens of options. The **Where to Stay** info on the GW website lists partner hotels, often with group rates . In 2025, organizers noted the event *“fills hotels, restaurants, and shops across the region”* . So booking early is smart, especially for downtown hotels or ones near Fallbrook. Some budget-minded riders camp – there are state parks (Branched Oak, etc.) within ~30min drive, and a few locals even offer yard camping via forums.
	•	**Check-In & Expo:** Gravel Worlds has a multi-day **event schedule**. Packet pickup and a small expo typically happen on Thursday and Friday at the event center . In 2025, Thursday had a big expo with 75+ vendors and group shake-out rides . Friday continued expo hours, plus the 300-mile race started Friday 5pm, and all the running events were Friday too . There’s often live music and food trucks at the venue (e.g. Friday night live band). The vibe is very **festive and family-friendly** – locals come out, there’s beer from local breweries, etc. Many describe it as a **“Gravel Family reunion”** feel. It’s not as enormous as Unbound’s expo, but it’s one of the larger gravel expos after Unbound and SBT. You can meet some pros, check out sponsor booths (tires, nutrition, gear), and soak in the excitement. The organizers do rider meetings (often virtual now) and last-minute announcements at the expo.
	•	**Start Line Logistics:** The 150-mile and 75-mile races start early Saturday (often 6:30am for 150 general field, with elite waves at 5:55 and 6:05am , then 7:00am for 75)  . It’s usually a mass start by category – e.g. all 150-milers together (with elites slightly earlier to compete separately). The start line is organized but laid-back; no seeding pens except the front for elites. Plenty of space to queue up. Temperatures at dawn might be cool (60s°F), so some wear a light jacket to toss at the start. There’s typically a **neutral rollout** for a few miles escorted by lead vehicles until hitting gravel – this helps string out the pack and safely leave Lincoln. Local police assist with any traffic control out of town. All this is well-communicated ahead.
	•	**Course Markings & Navigation:** The course is **primarily navigated by GPS**. They provide a GPX file a week out. Traditional cue sheets are available too, and some turns in remote areas might have signs or pirate flags, but **do not expect full markings**. Past riders mention a few missed turns by those relying purely on following others. A cycling computer with the route loaded is highly recommended (and maybe a backup battery if you’ll be out long). That said, in daylight there will almost always be someone in sight ahead to follow. For 300-milers at night, navigation is more critical; those folks often pair up for night to avoid solo nav mistakes.
	•	**Support on Course:** As detailed earlier, two checkpoints for 150mi (miles ~60 and ~110) with water/food and mechanical help  . They are well-run with volunteers logging your race number. There can be lines for water if you’re mid-pack, but they try to have plenty of jugs ready. Aid stops might be at rural churches or community centers. They also provide drop bags option in some years (e.g. you could send a drop bag to checkpoint with spare kit or your specific drink mix). Check the race info if drop bags are allowed; often they have a system for 300-milers at least. No personal outside support means you can’t have your crew there, but the volunteers almost feel like your crew – very helpful and enthusiastic.
	•	**Lincoln Amenities:** One **big advantage** is the plethora of **hotels and food** in Lincoln. Downtown Lincoln is about 15 minutes from the start, and has everything from budget motels to nice hotels. Also, Lincoln being a college town, there are lots of restaurants, breweries, and coffee shops. Gravel Worlds even organizes events at local businesses: e.g. a Welcome Party at a downtown taproom on Wednesday . Many riders go out for a celebratory meal or beers Saturday night – Lincoln’s Haymarket district is a popular spot (and yes, you might see gravel bikes leaned outside bars that evening!). The city welcomes cyclists; local news and even drivers are aware of the event, so there’s a generally friendly atmosphere toward riders on the roads.
	•	**Transportation:** Lincoln has a regional airport, but many fly into Omaha Eppley Airport (OMA) which is a one-hour drive. If flying with a bike, you can rent a car or use Gravel Worlds’ partnership with BikeFlights (ship your bike ahead to a local shop) . Once in Lincoln, you likely need a car to get around to the venue and such, though some hotels might be close enough to ride to the start. There’s ample parking at the event center and they handle traffic well (volunteers guide cars on race morning). Post-race, they even have showers available sometimes (in 2021 they had portable showers at finish, not sure if every year).
	•	**Event Vibe & Community:** The **vibe** is often described as *“Gravel Family”*. It’s a mix of serious racing and fun. You’ll see top pros with their game faces, but you’ll also see folks in pirate costumes, or bikes pulling trailers with a stuffed parrot (yes, that happened). The finish line is usually a party – music playing, announcer calling out names (they try to announce every finisher if possible), and spectators cheering even late finishers. In 2025, they had live music from noon to 10pm on race day at the venue , so it was like a mini festival – riders finish, clean up, then hang out with beers and cheer others in. Families are around, kids playing, etc. It truly is a welcoming scene rather than just a race and done.
	•	**Post-Race Amenities:** Finishers get a medal (or trophy sword for category winners), and a nice cold drink and meal. Typically, your entry might include a ticket for a post-race meal – often provided by a local BBQ or catering truck at the finish. Hydration wise, they have water, recovery drinks, maybe a local craft beer for those of age. And yes, plenty of **Nebraska corn** is usually on the menu in some form! The awards ceremony happens later Saturday for top finishers once enough are in. But they also save a special moment for the **DFL finisher** as mentioned – it’s tradition to pop those champagne bottles with the very last finisher sometime before the Saturday night concert ends .
	•	**Safety & Support:** Lincoln/Lancaster County officials are involved to ensure safety. Sheriff cars patrol some gravel intersections to monitor vehicle traffic. Gravel Worlds also has a safety team that roves the course (on bikes or ATVs) to assist any emergencies. Still, these are open public roads – you might encounter farm vehicles or pick-up trucks. The event reminds riders to obey traffic laws, ride right, and not litter (gravel etiquette). Historically, local drivers have been mostly patient, given all the outreach (the press releases even ask local drivers for caution that weekend) .

All told, **logistics for Gravel Worlds are straightforward**: get yourself to Lincoln, and the rest is easy – numerous lodging options, a centralized expo/start area with good facilities, and a supportive community. It’s one reason people love this event; compared to an ultra-remote race, here you have the comfort of a city but immediately access to gravel backroads. As a writer for Elevation Outdoors noted, Lincoln provides *“plenty of affordable hotels, and more city resources… integrating international-caliber gravel racing into an established sports ecosystem”* . The vibe is equal parts high-level competition and Midwest hospitality. So, racers can focus on pedaling their hearts out, knowing that the logistics (food, drink, directions, celebration) are well-handled by the Gravel Worlds crew. Or in simpler terms, *“Arrive a few days early, soak up the gravel family vibes, race hard, then enjoy a Runza and a beer with new friends after crossing the line.”* That’s the Gravel Worlds logistics experience!

**“WHAT I WISH I KNEW” QUOTES**

Lessons learned abound from those who have ridden Gravel Worlds. Here are some direct “what I wish I knew” insights and quotes from past participants:
	•	**“I wish I had reapplied chamois cream and sunscreen.”** – After nearly 11 hours in the saddle in 2024’s heat, one finisher noted the small things he’d do differently: *“Next time* ***more chamois cream****. [And a] small sunblock to reapply since I didn’t get to until mile 100… only a tad burned on one arm so eh, success.”*  The takeaway: long hours mean sweat can wear off your chamois lube and sun protection. Seasoned riders pack a tiny packet of Chamois Butt’r and a mini sunscreen in their kit. The mid-race reapplication at an aid station can save you from saddle sores and sunburn – discomforts that really add up by the end.
	•	**“Bring two lights – it might be dark if you’re slow.”** – A back-of-pack 150mi finisher from a prior year wrote that he underestimated his time and didn’t have a proper light when dusk fell (he finished after 9pm). *“I was literally using my phone flashlight the last 5 miles. Stupid mistake. Now I tell everyone: even if you expect to finish by sunset,* ***have a small headlight*** *in your bag. You just never know.”* Indeed, unforeseen delays (mechanicals, illness) can have 150-milers finishing in the dark. A small LED can be a race-saver. And absolutely for 300-milers: bring robust lights and backups – multiple riders have been caught with a dead battery at 3am on a moonless gravel road, not fun.
	•	**“Train for the mental game, not just the distance.”** – A 2022 first-timer said: *“I knew 150 miles would hurt physically, but* ***the mental challenge surprised me****. I hit a wall of negativity at mile 90 that almost made me quit. Next time, I’ll have some strategies for that.”* She now coaches others to have a mental plan: whether it’s mantras, breaking the course into segments, or having a motivating playlist for the tough miles. Many wish they’d known how important mental resilience is – it’s easy to focus on physical training and neglect preparing your mind for the inevitable low points. One tip that surfaces: write something on your top tube (tape a small note) reminding you why you’re doing this, to read when you want to abandon.
	•	**“The hills. Dear god, the hills.”** – Paraphrasing the sentiment of many: they knew it’d be hilly, but not *that* hilly. A quote from a 2019 finisher: *“I live in Colorado and thought Nebraska would be flat-ish.* ***Wrong.*** *I wish I had done more hill repeats. It was just roller after roller – over 10k ft of climbing felt like death by a thousand cuts.”* Even though the elevations aren’t high, the frequency is killer. Another said, “I’d tell any newcomer: if you think you’ve done enough hill work, do more.” So, essentially everyone who underestimates the Nebraska terrain regrets it. The advice from their hindsight: incorporate a ton of short hill intervals in training, or find somewhere to simulate continuous rolling terrain for hours. Also gear your bike accordingly (as mentioned earlier).
	•	**“Take care of your bike in the mud – or it won’t take care of you.”** – After a muddy year, one rider lamented that he *“rode through the mud sections until my derailleur literally exploded. I should have stopped and cleared mud sooner.”* In retrospect he wished he had the patience to carry or gently walk the bike through the worst mud to preserve it. Similarly, riders have said they wish they brought a small brush or extra water to clean the drivetrain during muddy races. The lesson: in extreme conditions, a bit of preventative TLC mid-race can be the difference between finishing and a mechanical DNF.
	•	**“Don’t skip the oasis or that random kid’s lemonade stand.”** – A fun one: A 150mi rider in 2021 shared that he blew past a small “unofficial” aid (a family handing out drinks at mile 40) feeling good, but later deeply craved water and regretted not stopping. He wrote, *“When a kid offers you lemonade on a 100° day, TAKE IT. I wish I had.”* Gravel Worlds often has locals who set up impromptu water stations or hoses – many veterans now know to top off fluids whenever the chance arises, even if you feel okay. Little things like an ice-cold cup from a roadside volunteer can revive you, and skipping them to save 2 minutes might backfire 10 miles later when you’re parched.
	•	**“Nutrition, nutrition, nutrition.”** – A lot of riders talk about learning (sometimes the hard way) how much to eat and drink. A quote from a 2022 report: *“I under-fueled early on and paid for it at mile 110. I wish I’d forced myself to eat more in the first 50. You get behind on calories and it’s game over.”* The common wisdom that many first-timers only realize afterward is to start eating/drinking right away and do so consistently – even when you’re not hungry or the excitement suppresses appetite. Those who didn’t often bonked. So a common “what I’d do differently” is: set a timer to take a gel every 30-45 min, and sip electrolyte drink continuously. Your stomach might get weird in the heat, so have a variety (mix of gels, real food, salty stuff) because your cravings can change. People have also said they *wished they had brought electrolyte pills* when cramping hit late (the on-course drink might not match what you need exactly). So fine-tuning personal nutrition is a big hindsight point.
	•	**“Lincoln has Uber Eats – use it!”** – A humorous logistical one: A racer recounted finishing utterly wrecked and all the nearby restaurants’ kitchens were closed by 10pm. He didn’t have the energy to drive, so he went hungry until morning. After that, he notes, *“Now I stash some recovery protein and snacks in my hotel. And I learned Lincoln has delivery apps – could’ve ordered pizza to the hotel at 11pm. Wish I’d thought of that then!”* The point: plan your post-race meal in case your finish is late. Many others have since echoed this tip: have something easy back in your room (even instant ramen or whatever) if you end up too tired to go out.
	•	**“Don’t overpack your bike.”** – Some first-timers brought the kitchen sink due to fear of self-support, then realized they carried unnecessary weight. One wrote, *“I had 4 tubes, 3 CO2s, a huge multitool, like 20 gels… way too much. I wish I’d packed lighter – it was like hauling a Walmart on my frame.”* Experienced riders advise a balance: take what you truly need (one tube + plugs, 1 multitool, etc.) and trust the course/aid for the rest. Overloading can slow you and make the bike handle worse. It’s a common newbie thing – after the race you’ll likely sort your kit into “used” vs “never touched” and adjust for next time.
	•	**Attitude “Reset”:** A final heartfelt quote came from a mid-pack finisher reflecting on mindset: *“At my lowest point I was cursing the heat and hills. In hindsight, I wish I had taken a moment to look around and appreciate where I was – riding my bike in a beautiful place, part of this crazy gravel family. That perspective would’ve helped when I felt sorry for myself out there.”* It’s a lovely reminder that while Gravel Worlds can dish out suffering, remembering *why* you’re doing it and finding some joy in the challenge is crucial. Many “what I wish I knew” boil down not to gear or training, but to mental approach – expecting the lows, embracing the experience, and knowing that yes it will hurt, but that’s the point and the privilege.

Compiling all these nuggets: Future participants can learn to **prepare for extreme conditions, nail their fueling, respect the terrain, and carry only what’s needed**. And perhaps the best advice is to remember *it’s supposed to be hard but also fun.* As one gravel veteran succinctly put it on Reddit after dishing advice, *“Mostly, I wish I knew ahead of time that by the finish I’d already be planning to come back next year – because that’s Gravel Worlds.”*
