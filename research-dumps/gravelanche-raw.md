## RACE HISTORY & FOUNDING

### Origins
- **Inaugural Event:** March 2, 2024
- **Organizer:** Whitewater Center (headquartered in Charlotte, NC - the largest outdoor center of its kind globally featuring 1,300 acres of protected land)
- **Venue:** Middleburg property in Huger, SC - a 323-acre former rice estate dating to the 17th century
- **Historic Significance:** The main house at Middleburg was built in 1697 and is the oldest standing wooden plantation house in South Carolina

### Race Philosophy
The event is described as "an endurance bicycle ride that subjects the participants to the inherent and considerable risks normally associated with a continuous gravel cycling event." The emphasis is on self-sufficiency and endurance, with riders facing substantial physical challenges and long periods out of range of food or water.

### Early Results (Inaugural 2024)
- Nina "Machina" Machnowski finished 2nd place women's field, 6th overall in the 60-mile race
- Conditions were brutal with "monsoon-like rain" in the two days prior to the race

## TERRAIN & COURSE

### Geographic Setting
- **Forest:** Francis Marion National Forest (263,904 acres / 1,070 sq km)
- **Ecosystem:** Middle Atlantic coastal forests ecoregion
- **Boundaries:** Santee River (north), Intracoastal Waterway and Atlantic Ocean (east)
- **Proximity:** 40 miles north of Charleston, 30 miles south of Myrtle Beach

### Surface Conditions
The course features a true all-road cycling experience with varied surfaces:

| Surface Type | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| Gravel | Hard-packed forest service roads (primary) |
| Forest Floor | Natural terrain sections |
| Coquina | Crusite shell-based surfaces |
| Boardwalks | Elevated sections through wetlands |
| Mud | "Slimy peanut butter-type mud" when wet |
| Potholes | Numerous throughout - some "car-sized, bike-swallowing" |

### Terrain Character
- **Elevation Profile:** Pancake flat - minimal elevation change
- **Challenge Type:** Endurance-focused rather than climbing
- **Notable Quote (from related Hellhole Gravel Grind):** "Flat seems easy on paper, but the thing is, you can't ever stop pedaling. There's no downhills to recover on. You have to keep the legs moving, especially on dirt. As soon as you stop pushing it, your momentum just disappears into thin air."

### Landscape Features
- Swamps and pine forests merging with coastal savannas
- Mature long-leaf pine forests
- Grassy savannas
- Wetland areas
- Historic rice fields and 330-year-old live oaks at start/finish

### Wildlife & Hazards
- Bears
- Snakes
- Wild boar
- General "megafauna"
- Vehicle traffic (forest service roads)
- Natural elements and weather dangers

### Equipment Recommendations
- **Tire Width:** Minimum 28c with tread recommended
- **Nina Machina's Setup (inaugural race):** Schwalbe Thunder Burt 2.1" MTB tires at 19 PSI front / 20 PSI rear for muddy conditions
- **Navigation:** GPS device essential (no course markings)

## WEATHER

### November Climate in Huger, SC (Lowcountry)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|

| Daylight | ~7 hours bright sunlight |
| Precipitation | ~2 inches (November is driest month in SC) |

### Race-Day Risks

- Potholes fill with water creating "water pits"

### Related Community Insights (Francis Marion / Hellhole Gravel Grind)

**From Hellhole Gravel Grind race reports (same terrain):**

> "Flat seems easy on paper, but the thing is, you can't ever stop pedaling. There's no downhills to recover on. You have to keep the legs moving, especially on dirt. As soon as you stop pushing it, your momentum just disappears into thin air."

**From Gulo Composites (Nina Machina race report):**

> "The Francis-Marion National Forest near Charleston, where the race took place, is notorious for brutal conditions, especially early in the year. Much of the course included slimy peanut butter-type mud with lots of potholes and water pits."

**From Hellhole Gravel Grind participants:**

> "The roads of Francis Marion are littered with car-sized, bike-swallowing potholes, megafauna such as bear, snakes, boar (and chupacabra...), and trail sections."

> "The road is overgrown with grass, however, large holes have recently been filled in with rocks. There's a moment in time where riders face a distinction between 'gravel' and 'rocks.' Pushing through those rocks felt akin to deep sugar sand, with the front tire all over the place."

### General Lowcountry Gravel Sentiment
The South Carolina Lowcountry is praised as offering "some of the most unique and beautiful off-road riding in North America" with hundreds of miles of forest service roads and trails. The scenery is described as "constantly changing" as swamps and pine forests merge with coastal savannas.

## SUGGESTED GRAVEL GOD RATINGS

*Scale: 1-5 (1 = Easy/Low, 5 = Difficult/High)*

| Category | Rating | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| **Logistics** | 3/5 | Good airport access (CHS 20 mi), variety of lodging, but rural venue requires planning; no course markings mean GPS prep essential |
| **Length** | 4/5 | 100-mile option is substantial endurance challenge; multiple distance options (35/60/100) accommodate various levels |
| **Technicality** | 3/5 | Not technical climbing/descending, but challenging surfaces (mud, potholes, varied terrain), navigation required, self-sufficiency mandatory |
| **Elevation** | 1/5 | Pancake flat Lowcountry terrain; minimal elevation gain (~300-500 ft estimated for 100 miles) |
| **Climate** | 3/5 | November timing offers moderate temperatures (55-70°F) but unpredictable weather; rain creates extremely challenging mud conditions |
| **Altitude** | 1/5 | Sea level / coastal plain - no altitude considerations |
| **Adventure** | 4/5 | Wild terrain with megafauna (bears, boar, snakes), historic setting, self-sufficiency requirement, unmarked course through national forest swamps and savannas |

### Overall Character Assessment
Gravelanche is a unique endurance gravel event that challenges riders through relentless flat terrain rather than elevation. The Francis Marion National Forest setting provides an adventure-focused experience with potential wildlife encounters, varied surfaces, and the need for complete self-sufficiency. The November date offers mild weather but the region is notorious for difficult conditions when wet. Best suited for riders seeking an off-the-beaten-path adventure in a historic, wild setting.
