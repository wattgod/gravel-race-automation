**Course Characteristics:** "Stunning gravel roads meander through thickly forested valleys, tilt skywards over the hills of the High country and undulate across farmlands and ridgelines." Routes wind through rolling farmlands with vistas of the Goulburn Valley and Strathbogie Ranges. (https://www.granfondoguide.com/Events/Index/10380/gravelista)

**Surface Quality:** Described as "finest, fastest & least-known gravel in the country" and "fast flowing smooth gravel" by reconnaissance riders. (https://www.gravelista.cc/ and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=venrWdFCDXU)

**2025 Race-Day Conditions:** "Muddy gravel race" with slippery roads due to rain. (https://granfondodailynews.com/2025/10/28/uci-gravelista-results-brendan-johnston-repeats-down-under/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Elite Men's Race Dynamics [ELITE]:** The 2025 men's elite race came down to a sprint finish between Brendan Johnston and Mark O'Brien, separated by only 3 seconds after 135km (3:46:57 vs 3:47:00). Third place Kevin Biffiger was 1:16 back, suggesting the race shattered on the climbs or in the final kilometers. (https://www.cyclingnews.com/races/uci-gravel-world-series-events-2025/gravelista-2025/results/)

**Elite Women's Race Dynamics [ELITE]:** Sharlotte Lucas rode "a smart and steady race" to win by 3:21 over Sophie Byrne, with third place Ella Bloor finishing 7:23 back. This suggests Lucas was able to ride solo or in a small group for much of the race.

**Key Selection Point:** Multiple sources indicate Wicket Hill (30km and 73km marks) as "the crux of the course" where the race is likely decided. The 11% average gradient over 1km appears to be where gaps open. (https://ucigravelworldseries.com/en/seymour/)

**Qualification Stakes:** The event carries significant competitive stakes as a UCI Gravel World Series qualifier, with top 25% finishers in each UCI age/gender category automatically qualifying for the UCI Gravel World Championships.
