## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Brian Turk [ELITE] (2nd Place, 333 miles):** "This tops my lifetime accomplishments list for sure. Still not sure what made me decide to try the Gray Duck Grit 333 mile race known as the Cow, but I did. With 14 starters my goal was to finish, not compete for a podium. I was last to leave the start and was somewhere in the area of 7th at 55 miles and 5th at 110. Never passed anyone else - but three ahead of me dropped and I was 2nd at 165….and never gave up. I battled the cold and rain. I battled the 30 mph head and cross winds that took out a lot of riders... I spent the last 2+ hours unable to hold my head up."

**Paul Palecek [UNKNOWN]:** "My Gray Duck ride was definitely the highlight of my year! With all the awesome athletes posting insane times sometimes it's easy to forget all the intangibles that these events and biking in general brings. I have struggled with mental health myself and I've never found a medication or counselor that is as effective at reducing anxiety as a long bike ride."

**Jack Reher [UNKNOWN]:** "Gray Duck Grit allows one to clear the space between their ears. There are no boundaries or restrictions within their motto 'Ride Your Ride'. It's you against yourself. How far can you go? The beauty of this particular race is nobody knows the outcome... all the effort is worthy of the experience & friendships made." (https://www.thenxrth.com/post/gray-duck-grit-first-look-3-riders-share-3-perspectives-of-3-races)

**Pat Moore [UNKNOWN] (50 miles):** "After a summer of long races (800 miles of the Tour Divide, the Wolf Bikepacking Race (225), and the DAMn (240)), I opted for the new 50-mile route. The course was beautiful. Rolling climbs and fast descents were once again the name of the game of Driftless Country." (https://www.thenxrth.com/post/horsetracks-cowbells-blue-sky-gravel-pat-moore-s-gray-duck-grit-recap)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Driftless Region Character:** "Rolling climbs and fast descents were once again the name of the game of Driftless Country." Course includes a "healthy mix of forest and farmland, popping in and out of the woods and occasionally riding along the Cannon River." (https://www.thenxrth.com/post/horsetracks-cowbells-blue-sky-gravel-pat-moore-s-gray-duck-grit-recap)

**Specific Sections (50-mile course):** "Leaving the outskirts of Cannon Falls, racers entered a healthy mix of forest and farmland... Things began to look and feel familiar to the 2023 course when I hit 380th Street which goes over Highway 52." The final 10 miles included "a wonderfully fast descent." (https://www.thenxrth.com/post/horsetracks-cowbells-blue-sky-gravel-pat-moore-s-gray-duck-grit-recap)

**webdev511 [ELITE]:** "Limestone gravel, and LOTS of rollers... They're getting elevation by dropping in and out of the canyons along the Mississippi River valley. The ones near Frontenac are not something I went out of my way to climb last time I was there. The rest is typical Midwest rolling with occasional drops into smaller river and stream valleys. Not nearly as hilly as the full on driftless area near Lewiston." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/grey-duck-grit-in-minnesota/74859)

**Start Line:** "We rolled out under blue skies... on a horse race track which admittedly was a first for me." (https://www.thenxrth.com/post/horsetracks-cowbells-blue-sky-gravel-pat-moore-s-gray-duck-grit-recap)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Support Crew Critical for Ultra Distances [ELITE]:** Brian Turk (2nd place, 333 miles): "The most important difference in this race was having Candace Turk as my support. She was able to meet me at every aid station every 55 miles. This meant I had all the food and hydration I needed when I needed it and she had it ready for me. It meant I had every clothing option I needed for changing conditions. I could add and drop batteries and lights as needed... I couldn't have done it without the support of others....and everything working in my favor." (https://www.thenxrth.com/post/gray-duck-grit-first-look-3-riders-share-3-perspectives-of-3-races)

**Support Crew Context [COMPETITIVE]:** "DingleTower" considering 222 miles: "I've considered the 222. I wouldn't have a support crew though which is a downside." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/grey-duck-grit-in-minnesota/74859)

**Attrition Pattern [ELITE]:** Brian Turk's position progression in the 333: Started last, 7th at 55 miles, 5th at 110 miles, 2nd at 165 miles. "Never passed anyone else - but three ahead of me dropped." (https://www.thenxrth.com/post/gray-duck-grit-first-look-3-riders-share-3-perspectives-of-3-races)

**Mid-Race Decision Point:** Shawn Wynn was in 4th place at 110 miles in the 333 but "was beaten by the cold and wind and figured he couldn't podium so dropped out." (https://www.thenxrth.com/post/gray-duck-grit-first-look-3-riders-share-3-perspectives-of-3-races)

**Physical Breakdown [ELITE]:** Brian Turk (2nd place, 333): "I spent the last 2+ hours unable to hold my head up." (https://www.thenxrth.com/post/gray-duck-grit-first-look-3-riders-share-3-perspectives-of-3-races)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Finish Line:** "Crossing the finish line to the amazing sound of the cowbell was as satisfying as always. The finish area at the Cannon Valley Fairgrounds was perfect. A food truck, music, and sunshine always seem to make for a good time." (https://www.thenxrth.com/post/horsetracks-cowbells-blue-sky-gravel-pat-moore-s-gray-duck-grit-recap)

**Inclusive Philosophy:** Mark Jesse (Race Director): "How fast you ride, when you ride, what gear you use, and where you do so is up to you, and we respect that. Inviting ALL is our approach. It's the simplest and easiest approach of 'the more, the merrier.'" (https://www.thenxrth.com/post/the-collective-passion-for-gravel-gray-duck-grit-rounds-the-corner-into-year-2)

**"Ride Your Ride" Motto:** "There are no boundaries or restrictions within their motto 'Ride Your Ride'. It's you against yourself." (https://www.thenxrth.com/post/gray-duck-grit-first-look-3-riders-share-3-perspectives-of-3-races)

**Community Support:** Paul Palecek: "At one point we stopped to help a distressed rider, giving him more water and food and gave him a pep talk." (https://www.thenxrth.com/post/gray-duck-grit-first-look-3-riders-share-3-perspectives-of-3-races)

**Volunteer Support:** Shawn Wynn and his partner Casey stayed with support crew Candace through overnight hours after Shawn dropped: "Their support to help Candace was such an unexpected help." (https://www.thenxrth.com/post/gray-duck-grit-first-look-3-riders-share-3-perspectives-of-3-races)

**Year 1 Reception:** Race Director feedback: "The overwhelmingly positive feedback and love we received from our cyclists left us speechless at times. Hearing that we're 'proof that perception can be reality' and we're 'changing gravel cycling' exceeded all expectations." (https://www.thenxrth.com/post/the-collective-passion-for-gravel-gray-duck-grit-rounds-the-corner-into-year-2)

**Charitable Mission:** "All proceeds, literally every penny, to a good cause" — donating to Fraser (autism and mental health services for children and families). Mark Jesse: "We love biking in remote areas on sketchy roads, trails, and fields. It's pretty darn cool! What we love much more is using that passion for gravel to make an impact on other people's lives. That's even cooler!" (https://www.thenxrth.com/post/the-collective-passion-for-gravel-gray-duck-grit-rounds-the-corner-into-year-2)

**Non-Binary/Gender Non-Conforming Categories:** "We strive to make GDG accessible to anyone who has a bike and wants to get after it by offering Non-Binary/Gender Non-Conforming categories for all our competitions and distances. In an arena historically male dominated, this change creates a space for all to feel welcome and represented." (https://grayduckgrit.com/)

**Northfield Community:** "Northfield residents and businesses are welcoming and very bike friendly. The town of 20,000 residents still has a small town charm along with several coffee shops, eateries, and breweries for cyclists to enjoy. The city of Northfield along with law enforcement were all on board and provided excellent support."
