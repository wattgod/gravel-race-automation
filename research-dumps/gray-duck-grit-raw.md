# GRAY DUCK GRIT - RAW RESEARCH DUMP

## OFFICIAL DATA

**Race Dates**

Gray Duck Grit V is scheduled for **Labor Day Weekend 2026**[6]. Based on the search results showing Gray Duck Grit IV occurred on **August 30-31, 2025**[3], and Gray Duck Grit III on **August 31, 2024**[5], the 2026 event will likely fall on a similar late-August/early-September timeframe, though the exact dates are not specified in the available search results.

**Distance Options**

Gray Duck Grit offers four distance options: **50, 69, 111, and 222 miles**[1][2][6]. The user-provided information indicates one option is 62 miles, though this does not match any of the four official distances listed in the search results.

**Location**

The event is held in **Cannon Falls, Minnesota** at the **Cannon Valley Fair** fairgrounds[3][4]. As of 2024, Gray Duck Grit relocated to this location[4].

**Registration Cost, Field Size, Prize Purse, Start Times, Aid Station Details, and Cutoff Times**

These specific details are **not available in the search results provided**. The search results reference BikeReg.com for registration but do not include pricing information, participant numbers, prize details, specific start times, aid station locations, or cutoff times.

**Elevation Gain by Distance**

The search results confirm that each distance option involves **elevation gains** to "conquer"[2], but specific elevation gain figures for each distance are not provided in the available search results.

## SUMMARY OF DATA GAPS

The search results provide solid information on the **event's mission, distance options, location, and inclusivity focus**, but fall short on:

- Specific 2025 and 2026 race dates (month and day)
- Registration fees and pricing
- Participant field size
- Elevation gain by distance
- Course surface breakdown and technical details
- Historical weather data
- Logistics (parking, lodging, packet pickup)
- Prize purse information
- Rider reviews, race reports, and community perception
- Notable past winners
- Detailed race history and founder information

To compile a truly comprehensive research dump, additional searches targeting BikeReg registration pages, Strava segment data, Reddit cycling communities (r/gravelcycling, r/CyclingMN), YouTube race coverage, and gravel cycling forums would be necessary.
