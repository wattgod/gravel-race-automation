**Peta Mullens [ELITE]:** "It's still my favourite course, in my favourite setting, at the best time of year and I'd highly recommend it to anyone who loves adventure and awesome trails, and the shorter varieties to anybody staring out." – 5-time Otway Odyssey female Champion (https://otwayodyssey.rapidascent.com.au/)

**Ben McDonald [UNKNOWN]:** "The course takes you through some of the most spectacular scenery you will ever see and will challenge you physically and mentally, but the camaraderie and support from your fellow riders makes it all worth it." – 2021 GOGG participant (https://otwayodyssey.rapidascent.com.au/49km-gravel/)

**Sam Maffett, Rapid Ascent Race Management [ORGANIZER]:** "We are excited to continue our association with the Gran Fondo World Tour® – Gravel and have the GOGG included in their prestigious race calendar. This collaboration cements the Otway Ranges as an international gravel riding destination, with its spectacular forests, smooth roads, and outstanding riding conditions. The GOGG's mix of timed and untimed segments allows riders to balance competition with the enjoyment of the breathtaking surroundings."

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Tyres [UNKNOWN/GENERAL ADVICE]:** Rapid Ascent claims you can do the GOGG on an all-road bike with 32mm tyres, but MarathonMTB.com notes: "we agree – if you know what you're doing." They recommend 40-45mm tyres as "a good choice, with a faster centre tread and some more shoulder knob. Something like a Maxxis Rambler is a great all-rounder." Set up tubeless with fresh sealant, and "consider using a tubeless tyre insert in the back wheel to reduce your chance of pinch flats at speed." (https://marathonmtb.com/2025/01/24/gear-up-for-the-great-otway-gravel-grind/)

**Bike Types [UNKNOWN/GENERAL ADVICE]:** GOGG courses "are designed to be completed on either a gravel bike, CX / adventure bike, MTB or a road bike (with min 32mm wide tyres designed for gravel), or flat handle-bar hybrid bike. Many options!" (https://otwayodyssey.rapidascent.com.au/49km-gravel/)

**Bottles & Cages [UNKNOWN/GENERAL ADVICE]:** "Don't go too light on your bottle cages, as gravel roads can dislodge full bottles from lightweight cages. Consider yourself warned!" (https://marathonmtb.com/2025/01/24/gear-up-for-the-great-otway-gravel-grind/)

**Chain Lube [UNKNOWN/GENERAL ADVICE]:** "For 4-6 hours or more in dry conditions, many 'dry' chain lubes will run just that – dry. Many riders prefer wax based lubes like Squirt or Smoove. Ride Mechanic also have their new Bike Cream which is a wax based lube that is water based for easy clean up." (https://marathonmtb.com/2025/01/24/gear-up-for-the-great-otway-gravel-grind/)

**Brakes [UNKNOWN/GENERAL ADVICE]:** "While the GOGG isn't hard on brakes per se, if you're not accustomed to doing events with other people, or off road, you may use your brakes more than you considered – so better make sure there's plenty of life in the brake pads." (https://marathonmtb.com/2025/01/24/gear-up-for-the-great-otway-gravel-grind/)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**97km Course [UNKNOWN]:** The 97km GOGG has "over 2200m of climbing" and takes "5 hours or more in the saddle" for most riders. (https://marathonmtb.com/2025/01/24/gear-up-for-the-great-otway-gravel-grind/)

**49km Course Profile [UNKNOWN]:** 
- **Leg 1 (33km):** "Flat / undulating 12km roll to Barwon Downs before a long and consistent climb through the rainforest on Delany Road. Turn right and continue along Mt Sabine Road for some sublime riding through Otways to the water point and timeout zone."
- **Leg 2 (16km):** "From the water point to the finish is basically all downhill on a fast, wide and smooth gravel road through the forest – it's a magnificent descent where hardly a pedal stroke is needed before returning to the finish line at the Football Ground."
(https://otwayodyssey.rapidascent.com.au/49km-gravel/)

**Road Surface [UNKNOWN/ORGANIZER INFO]:** "Courses are conducted exclusively on 2WD dirt roads – no single track. Roads will be dirt roads – predominantly smooth hard-packed earth with some very short sections of looser gravel or slightly rougher terrain. Require minimal 'technical bike skills' to complete and are achievable by all recreational riders." (https://otwayodyssey.rapidascent.com.au/49km-gravel/)

**Scenery [UNKNOWN]:** The course follows "a magical line through tall timber forests, past massive tree ferns, lookouts, lakes and beaches" and includes "kilometer after kilometer of traffic free dirt roads through The Great Otway National Park." (https://www.granfondoguide.com/Events/Index/7976/great-otway-gravel-grind and https://otwayodyssey.rapidascent.com.au/)

**Traffic Warning [ORGANIZER INFO]:** "All roads remain open to the public. Whilst there are not many cars – everyone must remain aware, stick to your side of the road and always riding in control." (https://otwayodyssey.rapidascent.com.au/49km-gravel/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Time Out Zones - Unique Rally Format [ALL LEVELS]:** Both GOGG races use a "rally format" where "the course includes a mix of timed racing segments and cruise segments where your race time is paused and you can chill or wait for friends without impacting your race time!" 

The 49km includes one timeout zone at 33km (at the top of the hill). The 97km includes 3 timeout zones. "Stop and wait for a friend, consume some calories or purchase a coffee from the coffee van without impacting your race time!"

**Key rule:** "Riders crossing any time point with less than 1 second apart will be given the time of the first rider to cross the point (as per the Tour de France). This is to help ensure that riders know they are on the same race time if they entered / exited all timing points together."

**Limit:** "1hr maximum in the time out. Note, it is not compulsory to stop, just an option as it's an 'untimed' section of the course."

**Strategic Use [COMPETITIVE/ELITE]:** For competitive racers, timeout zones "introduce a strategic element, as they push hard through each timed segment." You can "Spend longer in there and catch up to your group and you'll be ahead of them on race time…" (https://otwayodyssey.rapidascent.com.au/49km-gravel/ and https://marathonmtb.com/2025/01/24/gear-up-for-the-great-otway-gravel-grind/)

**Hydration Planning [UNKNOWN/GENERAL ADVICE]:** "Factor in about 1L an hour (or more on a hot day) and you'll realise it's time to make a proper nutrition plan... we expect you'll need to start with two full bottles, and a pocket of ride snacks."

**Water Points 49km:** WP1 at 33km (junction of Kaanglang Rd and Mt Sabien Road). "Timeout zone starts / finishes 500m either side of the water point."

**49km Self-Sufficiency Warning:** "With one time out zone, you do need to be able to be self-sufficient for the first 33km before you can get more water." (https://marathonmtb.com/2025/01/24/gear-up-for-the-great-otway-gravel-grind/ and https://otwayodyssey.rapidascent.com.au/49km-gravel/)

**First-Timer Training Question [RECREATIONAL]:** Reddit user Sayers133 asked about training "about 16 weeks out from the 2020 Great Otway Gravel Grind" having committed to their first race. They noted the course was "97km with just over 2,000m of climbing" and asked about expectations, prep, and pacing. Their plan: "back to back 4week FTP building plans on zwift followed by an 8week race prep and taper." (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/doom1i/so_ive_committed_to_my_first_race_what_now/)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Event Spirit [ORGANIZER PHILOSOPHY]:** "We believe the spirit of gravel is equally about: racing your bike and riding gravel roads through the wilderness and sharing the journey with other riders. The rally format achieves all this by making mixing race time with social time. Everyone wins!" (https://otwayodyssey.rapidascent.com.au/49km-gravel/)

**Inclusivity [UNKNOWN]:** "Whether you're an elite chomping at the bit to 'win the big one', an age-grouper looking to battle it out for podiums, a newbie wanting to try your hand in the 30km MTB, or a social-rider wanting to cruise the GOGG… Consider this your calling." (https://otwayodyssey.rapidascent.com.au/)

**Timeout Zone Social Element [ALL LEVELS]:** Timeout zones allow riders to "take a break to regroup with friends, grab a coffee, or even enjoy a swim at the beach! For social riders, this format takes the pressure off." (https://www.endurancesportswire.com/great-otway-gravel-grinder-the-australian-kickoff-for-the-gran-fondo-world-tour-gravel-series/)

**Women's Initiative [ALL LEVELS]:** The event includes the "much loved 'Otway Angels' initiative, to support and encourage women wanting to ride / race (yeah the girls!)" (https://otwayodyssey.rapidascent.com.au/)

**20th Anniversary (2026) Extras:** The 2026 edition promises "celebrations on and OFF the course (with retro bike parade, retro kit awards, personalised race plates, the 'Avenue of Achievement' celebrating icons of the Odyssey, more entertainment, more food." Plus "retro bike 'show and shine', Hall of Fame display, massive sign-on board, live entertainment, food, elite rider Q&As and more." (https://otwayodyssey.rapidascent.com.au/)

**Weekend Double Option:** "Make the most of your weekend in Forrest by 'doing a double' and racing on Saturday and Sunday! (and get 40% off the 2nd entry fee!). Enter one race and get 40% off a second event!" Includes "King and Queen of the Otway crowns... awarded to the riders who have the cumulative best place across the two events." (https://otwayodyssey.rapidascent.com.au/49km-gravel/ and https://marathonmtb.com/2025/01/24/gear-up-for-the-great-otway-gravel-grind/)

**Growing Event:** "Since the first event [in 2017], the GOGG has continued to grow." It's "fast gaining recognition as one of Australia's best gravel events." (https://marathonmtb.com/2025/01/24/gear-up-for-the-great-otway-gravel-grind/)

**Gateway Event [RECREATIONAL/NEW RIDERS]:** MarathonMTB notes "the GOGG truly shines, as a gateway to off-road riding for those with a mountain bike, gravel bike or cyclocross bike" and calls the 49km "an entry point to off-road events, there might be no better place to start!" (https://marathonmtb.com/2025/01/24/gear-up-for-the-great-otway-gravel-grind/)
