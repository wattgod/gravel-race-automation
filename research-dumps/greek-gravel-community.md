## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Meaghan Hackinen [UNKNOWN]:** "As much as I love the mountains, I have an aversion to steep drops, narrow trails, and rock gardens. Given the chunky terrain and sawtooth profile, I feared I was in over my head... In the end, I had more fun than I expected, and genuinely relished the moment-to-moment adventure of moving through a challenging, but beautiful, landscape." She took the women's win with an official finish of 4 days, 7 hours at the Hellenic Mountain Race. (https://www.renehersecycles.com/winning-the-hellenic-mountain-race/)

**Quinda [UNKNOWN]:** "Terrified, grateful, overwhelmed and at ease, I experienced a real rollercoaster of emotions in the days leading up to the race... It felt like a cherry on top and I could fully embrace the happiness that comes with the victory." Won the women's race in 7 days and 10 minutes at Hellenic Mountain Race 2023.

**Jari-Matti Latvala (Team Principal) [ELITE]:** "Greece can suit our drivers well, as the roads there are a bit wider and faster than in Sardinia, and opening the road is usually not quite as tough." (https://tgr-wrt.com/greek-gravel-classic-the-next-test-for-toyota-gazoo-racing/)

**Elfyn Evans [ELITE]:** "The Acropolis is another of the tougher gravel rallies on the calendar with a hard and rocky base and a lot of loose rocks. We're going there at a different time of year to usual, so it has the potential to be very hot and demanding for the cars and the tyres." (https://media.toyota.co.uk/greek-gravel-classic-the-next-test-for-toyota-gazoo-racing/)

**Kalle Rovanperä [ELITE]:** "The style of the stages and the surface are a bit different to Sardinia, and it can be harder for the tyres if you're pushing hard." (https://media.toyota.co.uk/greek-gravel-classic-the-next-test-for-toyota-gazoo-racing/)

**Sébastien Ogier [ELITE]:** "The challenges in Greece are not so different, with high temperatures and a rough and rocky surface, and hopefully we can be strong once more in these conditions." (https://tgr-wrt.com/greek-gravel-classic-the-next-test-for-toyota-gazoo-racing/)

**Takamoto Katsuta [ELITE]:** "The Acropolis is never an easy rally because you need to be able to take care of the car and the tyres." (https://tgr-wrt.com/greek-gravel-classic-the-next-test-for-toyota-gazoo-racing/)

**Sami Pajari [ELITE]:** "On rough rallies like these you need to be very careful in the lower categories to look after the car, whereas the Rally1 car can handle a lot more, so you need to learn to trust it and get used to being able to push harder." (https://tgr-wrt.com/greek-gravel-classic-the-next-test-for-toyota-gazoo-racing/)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Meaghan Hackinen [UNKNOWN]:** Made extensive adaptations including "swapping drop bars for flat bars and adding front suspension to my bike" for the Hellenic Mountain Race. She rode a Salsa Cutthroat with Fleecer Ridge tires. (https://www.renehersecycles.com/winning-the-hellenic-mountain-race/)

**Torsten Frank [UNKNOWN]:** Notes the importance of proper gearing: "Maybe you brought the wrong gearing. Maybe the surface was quite loose or too chunky to really keep pedaling the steeper parts." He emphasizes that power meters are common and uses them "in conjunction with heart rate to analyze and inform my training." However, "in bikepacking races I mostly (nearly always) omit the heart rate monitor." (https://torstenfrank.wordpress.com/2025/06/18/hellenic-mountain-race-2025-by-the-numbers-and-compared-to-alps-divide-and-el-piri-omg-its-so-much-hiking/)

## Weather Experienced

**Meaghan Hackinen [UNKNOWN]:** During Hellenic Mountain Race experienced "heavy clouds released a steady drizzle" and "In the rain, I sadly couldn't see much" of Pindus National Park. She dealt with "a deepening chill and both pairs of socks soaked." The afternoon before the race she experienced "afternoon heat." (https://www.renehersecycles.com/winning-the-hellenic-mountain-race/)

**Quinda [UNKNOWN]:** "I do know that I would handle the sweltering heat less well than these muddy roads" - suggesting she raced in muddy/rainy conditions rather than hot weather during Hellenic Mountain Race 2023. (https://www.komoot.com/collection/2141184/hellenic-mountain-race-bikepacking-through-the-greek-mountains)

**Multiple Elite Drivers [ELITE]:** The Acropolis Rally moving to June (from its usual September date) "brings the possibility of harsher conditions for cars, tyres and drivers" with "high temperatures" expected. (https://tgr-wrt.com/greek-gravel-classic-the-next-test-for-toyota-gazoo-racing/)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Meaghan Hackinen [UNKNOWN]:** Describes the Hellenic Mountain Race (878 km, 27,800m elevation) as "a combination of unpaved roads, tarmac, ancient stone paths, and singletrack." Specific sections: "Forest Prison" - "a dense and confusing stretch of trail" reached around midnight where "riding was impossible for the most part" with "downed trees and other obstacles." Found the trail by "identifying a discarded energy gel package." The route included "slippery-when-wet stone bridges and accompanying staircases" and "hour-and-a-half bushwhack/hike-a-bike climbing out of a river gorge." At Smolikas Refuge: "7 km (4.3 mile) hike down the mountain" described as "epic mountain bike singletrack" but for less technical riders meant walking. (https://www.renehersecycles.com/winning-the-hellenic-mountain-race/)

**Torsten Frank [UNKNOWN]:** Provides detailed climbing factors - Hellenic Mountain Race has a climbing factor of 31.8 (elevation in meters divided by distance in km), meaning 31.8m of climbing per kilometer. For context: "Everything around 20 is downright alpine" and typical middle European mountain ranges are "6 to 12." Atlas Mountain Race by comparison is only 15.4. He notes extensive hike-a-bike: "some terrain can outright force you to dismount and hike or even hoist your bike up a partly overgrown and rocky single trail." (https://torstenfrank.wordpress.com/2025/06/18/hellenic-mountain-race-2025-by-the-numbers-and-compared-to-alps-divide-and-el-piri-omg-its-so-much-hiking/)

**Katerina Bratsou [COMPETITIVE]:** From Toyota WRC test in Greece: Stage "Livadia" was used first, followed by "Caroutes, an area really close to nature. This special stage features lot of technical sections. There are no communication networks available in that area." (https://rallydiaries.eu/en/toyota-gazoo-racing-wrc-test-greek-gravel)

**Elite Drivers [ELITE]:** Acropolis Rally route includes "three stages on familiar roads around Loutraki" and "the Stiri stage, last driven in 1997." Sunday features "brand-new Smokovo and well-known Tarzan." The surface is characterized as "hard and rocky base and a lot of loose rocks." (https://media.toyota.co.uk/greek-gravel-classic-the-next-test-for-toyota-gazoo-racing/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Meaghan Hackinen [UNKNOWN]:** "I felt like I had no choice but to commit nearly all my energy to tackling the challenges at hand: pacing the climbs, safely navigating the descents, and keeping myself fed and hydrated along the way." She adapted by touring to the start over 4 days (380km) which "settles my mind and body. Pre-race anxieties vaporize as the pedals turn." She "pledged to walk all the difficult portions" and stopped early at 8:30pm on day 2 "to get a few hours of quality sleep" in a hotel when dealing with soaked socks and deepening chill. Her preparations included "high-intensity training to increase my power on the double-digit pitches, and cultivating mindset strategies—namely patience—to match the terrain." Finished in 4 days, 7 hours. (https://www.renehersecycles.com/winning-the-hellenic-mountain-race/)

**Quinda [UNKNOWN]:** Strategy included having her sister join "not to race or ride bikes, but to support me before and after the race... someone who could look after me the days leading up to the race and also to take care of me after I finished." For wildlife: "If I was afraid they might be around I would sing to them and let them know how cute they are." Finished in 7 days, 10 minutes. (https://www.komoot.com/collection/2141184/hellenic-mountain-race-bikepacking-through-the-greek-mountains)

**Torsten Frank [UNKNOWN]:** Notes that "the more off-road an event is and the more elevation difference there is to tackle the more likely it is that you will hike your bike." He emphasizes that without adjusting power meter data for hike-a-bike, metrics "will utterly misinterpret the demands of such races the more hike-a-bike there is involved. And especially in the Hellenic Mountain Race there was loads of Hike-a-Bike. Up – and at times even down." (https://torstenfrank.wordpress.com/2025/06/18/hellenic-mountain-race-2025-by-the-numbers-and-compared-to-alps-divide-and-el-piri-omg-its-so-much-hiking/)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Meaghan Hackinen [UNKNOWN]:** Lost her sleeping mat at some point during the race: "I can't remember when I lost my sleeping mat. All I know is when I reached exhaustion at 3:00 a.m. and pulled over to rest under the cover of a church awning, I didn't find it strapped to my seat post bag." She also crashed when attempting to "bunnyhop some slippery blue piping" and "arrived at the first checkpoint mud-spackled, with ruby red blood oozing from my right knee." (https://www.renehersecycles.com/winning-the-hellenic-mountain-race/)

**Torsten Frank [UNKNOWN]:** Identifies key risk factors: wrong gearing for the steep terrain, surface being "quite loose or too chunky to really keep pedaling the steeper parts," and routes with sections "which can't be ridden no matter what." The extreme climbing factor of 31.8 means "the more climbs there are and the steeper and more technical those are, the less you can find rest on your bike. As the climbs will be challenging, but so will be the descends, too." (https://torstenfrank.wordpress.com/2025/06/18/hellenic-mountain-race-2025-by-the-numbers-and-compared-to-alps-divide-and-el-piri-omg-its-so-much-hiking/)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Meaghan Hackinen [UNKNOWN]:** During her pre-race tour through Greece: "I was beckoned into the cool shade under an awning by a man sipping from a big green bottle of Alfa beer. I grabbed a non-alcoholic drink from a nearby convenience store and joined him for a conversation using our translator apps." She learned "shops and restaurants are open late, but often close mid-day, that people are friendly (though English isn't commonly spoken outside the cities)." At the first checkpoint at Munti Smolikas Mountain Refuge: "The cosy atmosphere... was exactly what my body craved coming off the mountain. I spent several minutes idly pushing the last of my noodles around my plate, not wanting to leave." (https://www.renehersecycles.com/winning-the-hellenic-mountain-race/)

**Quinda [UNKNOWN]:** Notes the race had special meaning after recovering from post-concussive symptoms: "Being there at the start of the Hellenic Mountain Race, feeling fit and good meant the world to me, as it had been two whole years since I had an accident." The finish was meaningful: "I could fully embrace the happiness that comes with the victory." (https://www.komoot.com/collection/2141184/hellenic-mountain-race-bikepacking-through-the-greek-mountains)

**Katerina Bratsou [COMPETITIVE]:** About the WRC test event: "Spectators got their 'dose' four days in row. Their presence in a month which most people spend on beach, declares the lack of international races which our country used to host." She expresses: "My return for the rest of holidays and I feel overwhelmed of being part of this experience. My mind says 'when will be the next time?' 'Fortunately soon!' is the answer." (https://rallydiaries.eu/en/toyota-gazoo-racing-wrc-test-greek-gravel)

**Reddit user kasiofan [UNKNOWN]:** "I watched Fthiotidos Rally for the Greek Gravel championship in a classic Acropolis Rally special stage, Eleftherohori." (https://www.reddit.com/r/rally/comments/14ovffv/today_was_rally_day/)
