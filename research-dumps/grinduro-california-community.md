## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**John Watson [COMPETITIVE]:** "Grinduro was the first of its kind — a gravel race inspired by the enduro race format, where only specific segments were timed... The pendulum swung wide with Grinduro in 2019, amassing 2000 riders. And yet, 2025's turnout felt more true to spirit – intimate, like a family reunion. All one can hope is that people will go out and spread the word of just how good this event (still) is." (https://theradavist.com/2025-grinduro)

**John Watson [COMPETITIVE]:** "Modern gravel racing, with its heavy-handed handling by professional cycling corporations, has altered gravel. Plenty of grassroots events are still flying the banner of fun, but by and large, gravel racing killed gravel... Gravel races killed gravel, but Grinduro proves that nostalgia wins." (https://theradavist.com/2025-grinduro)

**John Watson [COMPETITIVE]:** "In 2015, most were on the 40 mm WTB Nano tires. Overall, I'm really pleased with how these photos came out. Heavy lifts like this wreck my body but nurture my mind." (https://theradavist.com/2025-grinduro)

**Elite Rider [ELITE]:** "Stage 2 was a spectacularly fun singletrack blast through Redwood forest. It was only 3kms in length, but it felt way longer than that and was some of the most fun singletrack I've ever had the pleasure to ride. Twisty, swoopy, flowy. Just enough gradient change to give you a speed boost and make you concentrate. Dust motes floated through the trees. The air was thick with the heady scent of freshly released pine resin. If you got to the end without a huge gravel-grin plastered across your face, then you officially had no soul." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/grinduro-california-2022)

**Elite Rider [ELITE]:** "Pushing a gravel bike up a loose rocky 14-20 percent gradient climb in 29-degree temperatures probably isn't many people's idea of fun, even if it is labelled as a 'Hike-a-bike' challenge... In total we climbed for 5kms and gained 568m, with the high point being an impressive 2027m. On paper that works out at roughly 10% average gradient which shouldn't be too bad, but in practice, the climb was hideous." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/grinduro-california-2022)

**Elite Rider [ELITE]:** "I don't have any photos from Stage 4, but it was, to be honest, a bit of a f*cker. It was a descent, which should have been fantastic, but it came just after 7kms of prior descending on a combination of loose rock, bedrock, gravel and roots and most riders were utterly spent just from the sheer concentration required just to make it to the start of the segment." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/grinduro-california-2022)

**OriginalJimDog [UNKNOWN]:** "I've done a bunch of Grinduro events in Europe, PA and last year, I finally got out to Shasta. Out of all them, I felt the Shasta promoter, SORA, missed the mark the most... yeah, there was a lot of purple but it didn't have that Grinduro buzz I got at the other events." (https://www.reddit.com/r/BAbike/)

**OriginalJimDog [UNKNOWN]:** "I did Grinduro CA last year and had no probs on 700x40 Maxxis Ramblers. There was some chunky rocky stuff on one section, but for the most part, the course was nice rolling surface." (https://www.reddit.com/user/OriginalJimDog/)

**Jen Whant [RECREATIONAL]:** "Ever wanted to take on the ultimate challenge? Having never ridden a gravel bike before, Jen Whant decided she wanted to do @Grinduro California." (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9OvmGAA2a4)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Tire Choices:**
- **[UNKNOWN LEVEL]:** 700x40 Maxxis Ramblers handled the 2022 course with "no probs" including "some chunky rocky stuff on one section" (https://www.reddit.com/user/OriginalJimDog/)
- **[COMPETITIVE]:** 2015 riders mostly used 40mm WTB Nano tires (https://theradavist.com/2025-grinduro)
- **[ELITE]:** "Big volume tyres" were preferred for the technical descents in 2022 (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/grinduro-california-2022)

**Bike Setup:**
- **[ELITE]:** "The riders ranged from top pros in full race kit (Tiffany Cromwell from Canyon/SRAM was probably the most notable) to groups of friends in fancy dress. Bikes ranged from big travel full suspension trail bikes to CX bikes with 33mm tyres and cantilever brakes." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/grinduro-california-2022)
- **[ELITE]:** For gravel bikes on the 2022 climb: "Most riders walked. For anyone on gravel bikes with a typical 1:1 ratio, the combination of surface and gradient wasn't fun. Or rideable!" (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/grinduro-california-2022)
- **[UNKNOWN]:** Rider seeking advice wanted: "Clearance for 45mm tires or larger, 25 or less pounds, quality mech suited for climbing (2x or wide range 1x), Hydro brakes and dropper post would be a big plus" (https://www.reddit.com/r/xbiking/comments/be40lc/sign_up_for_grinduro_california_2019_now_i_need/)

**Photo Documentation:**
- **[COMPETITIVE]:** "What I really like about documenting races via e-MTB versus moto or car is that I don't dust the racers out with 2-stroke fumes or plumes of dirt. I just kindly pass on the right or left and say thanks." Used Mondraker Crafty RR on Eco mode all day with 41% battery remaining. (https://theradavist.com/2025-grinduro)

## Weather Experienced

**2019 Mt. Shasta:** Rain conditions documented in race video titled "2019 GRINDURO! California: The Four Seasons Bike Race - Rain" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyfqpCn9ggo)

**2022 Mt. Shasta:** "29-degree temperatures" during the main climb (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/grinduro-california-2022)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**2022 Mt. Shasta Course (93km, 2175m climbing):**

**Stage 1:** "A long, fairly gentle fireroad climb that topped out at just over 1800m altitude. The climbing started right from the start line, but the timed portion was carefully located to mean riders' legs and lungs had warmed up by the time we reached the timing paraphernalia." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/grinduro-california-2022)

**Stage 2:** "3kms in length... some of the most fun singletrack I've ever had the pleasure to ride. Twisty, swoopy, flowy. Just enough gradient change to give you a speed boost and make you concentrate. Dust motes floated through the trees. The air was thick with the heady scent of freshly released pine resin." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/grinduro-california-2022)

**Stage 3:** "Described as a 'rolling gravel stage' by the organisers and was on a forest fireroad. There were glimpses of snow-capped mountains on the horizon and some sections of beautifully dappled sunshine, but the actual trails weren't all that memorable" (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/grinduro-california-2022)

**The Big Climb:** "According to the GPX trace from my bike computer, there was exactly 100m of riding between leaving the lunch spot and hitting the start of the big climb. In total we climbed for 5kms and gained 568m, with the high point being an impressive 2027m... the climb was hideous. Initially it was at least rideable, but as the climb went on the gradient increased, the surface deteriorated – it soon became loose fragments of rock and chunky gravel with sustained pitches of 18-20%." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/grinduro-california-2022)

**Stage 4:** "A descent... came just after 7kms of prior descending on a combination of loose rock, bedrock, gravel and roots... still steep, fast and loose, with frequent 180 degree hairpinned turns where a lapse in concentration would see you lose skin or plop gently off the edge of the world." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/grinduro-california-2022)

**2025 Quincy Course (51 miles, 7,200 feet climbing):**

Race features "four timed segments: a dirt road climb, a dirt road roller, a dirt road descent, and a singletrack descent. The race is not based on overall time, but the sum total of the timed stages." (https://quincymountainstomeadows.com/grinduro-race.php)

**Stage 1 - Huff-n-Puff:** "1.6 miles, 739 feet of gain. 9AM CUTOFF. A gut punch of a climb. But hey, the High Sierra views ease the pain!" (https://quincymountainstomeadows.com/grinduro-race.php)

**Stage 2 - Grizzly's Grinder:** "3.5 miles, 309 feet of gain, 304 feet of descent. 1:30PM CUTOFF. This one will be pedalllllllyyyyyy… in a good way. You may outspin your gears on the descent as the grade is very minimal. Equipment choice will come into play here, and speeds will be high!" (https://quincymountainstomeadows.com/grinduro-race.php)

**Stage 3 - King Solomon's Fall:** "2.4 miles, 803 feet of descent. 2:15PM CUTOFF. A consistently ripping descent on King Solomon Road. All dirt, no hurt (hopefully)." (https://quincymountainstomeadows.com/grinduro-race.php)

**Stage 4 - Smokechaser:** "5.6 miles, 2,202 feet of descent, 102 feet of ascent. 3:45PM CUTOFF. The classic stage. Flowy Mt. Hough singletrack, a throwback to the original Grinduro" (https://quincymountainstomeadows.com/grinduro-race.php)

**Pre-ride Experience:** "Within a few minutes of leaving the trail, the imposing sight of a snow-capped Mt Shasta, an active volcano that towers over the region at a height of 4321m, hoved into view... smooth flowy singletrack led to a techy rock garden, which was followed by a bermed descent through ancient Redwood trees." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/grinduro-california-2022)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Format Understanding:**
"You could party ride the whole thing and turn it up to eleven on these timed sections and win the entire event." (https://theradavist.com/grinduro-california-2025-quincy)

"Racers only need to make the cutoffs for each stage, and enjoy pedaling with your buddies at party pace in between." (https://quincymountainstomeadows.com/grinduro-race.php)

**Aid Station Strategy:**
**[ELITE]:** "The organisers had warned riders that there was a sting in the tail of the day, but before that, at the end of the Stage 3, they had set up a lunch stop. There was an impressive array of food available including four main course dishes, with plenty of healthy choices, lots of fresh fruit and cans of pop and local beer cooling in the nearby stream." Before Stage 4: "an unbelievably well stocked feed station, with everything from cups of chopped local fruit to shots of decent strength alcohol to cream cheese filled bagels on offer." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/grinduro-california-2022)

**2025 Aid Stations (Quincy):**
- Aid #1: 8.1 & 36.3 miles (hit twice)
- Aid #2: 26.3 miles
- Aid #3: 33.9 & 39.6 miles (hit twice)
- Aid #4: 41.6 miles
"All aid stations will be well-stocked with water, Tailwind hydration, GU product, fruit, and other tasty snacks." (https://quincymountainstomeadows.com/grinduro-race.php)

**Cutoff Times (2025 Quincy):**
- Stage 1: 9AM cutoff
- Stage 2: 1:30PM cutoff
- Stage 3: 2:15PM cutoff
- Stage 4: 3:45PM cutoff

## DNF Risk Factors

**The Big Climb (2022 Mt. Shasta):**
**[ELITE]:** "5kms and gained 568m, with the high point being an impressive 2027m... the climb was hideous... the surface deteriorated – it soon became loose fragments of rock and chunky gravel with sustained pitches of 18-20%. For the majority of riders, it was a challenge too far... Most riders walked." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/grinduro-california-2022)

**Technical Descents:**
**[ELITE]:** "The descent started straight away, and although it was untimed it was almost a mirror image of the climb – in places it was steep, loose, rocky, technical and a real challenge, even riding with big volume tyres." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/grinduro-california-2022)

**Stage 4 Concentration:**
**[ELITE]:** "Most riders were utterly spent just from the sheer concentration required just to make it to the start of the segment... frequent 180 degree hairpinned turns where a lapse in concentration would see you lose skin or plop gently off the edge of the world." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/grinduro-california-2022)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Event Philosophy:**
"Grinduro combines a gravel road race with a mountain bike-style endurance race to make one long loop of pavement and dirt for its competitors. It's also not just a bike race. It's a celebration of cycling with as much emphasis on the fun as the ride, with excellent food, an impressive display of art and incredible handmade bikes, live music, camping and a festival atmosphere." (https://www.activenorcal.com/your-complete-guide-to-grinduro-the-international-cycling-celebration-coming-to-mt-shasta/)

**Party-to-Race Ratio:**
"The ultimate social gravel race with the perfect party-to-race ratio. Maxin' and Relaxin'." (https://quincymountainstomeadows.com/grinduro-race.php)

**2025 Return to Quincy:**
**[COMPETITIVE]:** "2025's turnout felt more true to spirit – intimate, like a family reunion... The weekend includes Grinduro on Saturday, then a Mount Hough Enduro race on Sunday... the weekend drew around 450 signups – not the numbers the organizers were hoping for, but the bigger picture here is important to contextualize." (https://theradavist.com/2025-grinduro)

**[COMPETITIVE]:** "Now there are more kids around, fewer photos of whisky bottles, and not to mention the size tires people can clear now!... Events that are less focused on stats and rankings, that encourage camping, a social atmosphere, and unforgettable course routing, will always have a place in cycling." (https://theradavist.com/2025-grinduro)

**Participant Diversity:**
**[ELITE]:** "The participants, the bikes they bring and the trails used in the event are incredibly diverse and eclectic. The riders ranged from top pros in full race kit (Tiffany Cromwell from Canyon/SRAM was probably the most notable) to groups of friends in fancy dress." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/grinduro-california-2022)

**Pennsylvania Comparison:**
**[UNKNOWN]:** "Grinduro PA is very family friendly. The crew who run the east coast franchise are a NICA team and most have young families of their own, so always had things happening in the campgrounds to keep the kids entertained." (https://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/)

**[UNKNOWN]:** "Definitely no perfect bike for Grinduro, you'll curse your choice at some point on the route! At Grinduro PA in particular, you seem to eat your way around the course... there was everything from fries and cheesesteaks to ice cream last year!" (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/)

**Mt. Shasta Experience:**
**[UNKNOWN]:** "I felt the Shasta promoter, SORA, missed the mark the most... yeah, there was a lot of purple but it didn't have that Grinduro buzz I got at the other events. Hopefully Grinduro find a new organizer for the Cali franchise who is passionate about the format. SORA felt like they were just in it for the money." (https://www.reddit.com/r/BAbike/)
