## REDDIT & FORUM INSIGHTS

> "Grinduro is party with timed segments. Not a race—it's an event. Focus is descents, beer, good times." — u/GrinduroVet [Reddit] (https://reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/grinduro)

> "You need MTB skills. 50% singletrack, technical descents. Not for pure gravel riders." — u/QuincyLocal [Reddit] (https://reddit.com/r/gravelcycling)

> "Tire choice: 40-45mm fast-rolling but grippy (e.g., Panaracer GK SK+, WTB Byway). Too narrow = sketchy. Too wide = slow." — u/GrinduroCA [Reddit] (https://reddit.com/r/gravelcycling)

> "Vibe is 60% party, 40% race. Timed segments matter if you're competitive, but most people just have fun." — u/NorCalGravel [Reddit] (https://reddit.com/r/gravelcycling)
