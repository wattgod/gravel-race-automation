# GRINDURO — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Niky Taylor [RECREATIONAL]:** "The meme page challenged me to write a 12-15 page race report so here we are... I tried to approach this weekend as just riding for fun, but still got to tear it up a bit and learn more about gravel racing. Also I beat Cam. Not sure if I mentioned that." (https://www.altovelo.org/blog/race-report-grinduro-2023)

**Niky Taylor [RECREATIONAL]:** "The Grinduro race route did take us up a nice climb. Janene skipped it since she was doing Grindurito. I don't think anyone pushed their limits because it wasn't a race section. We spread out. Cam got made fun of for wearing a skinsuit. I got made fun of for Cam wearing a skinsuit." (https://www.altovelo.org/blog/race-report-grinduro-2023)

**Niky Taylor [RECREATIONAL]:** "As the finish line approached, idk someone told me to sprint and I was like nah that's ok. Then I wandered around and found Cam and Janene and got my picture taken." (https://www.altovelo.org/blog/race-report-grinduro-2023)

**Cyclepath PDX Writer [ELITE]:** "I'll be the first to admit that I am a competitive person, especially when it comes to bike racing. Having come to Grinduro with my friends, my first objective was to beat them. After the first two stages... I was in a good spot and felt confident about my chances. But it was on the third stage that things sort of fell apart for me." (https://www.cyclepathpdx.com/blogs/news/grinduro-2025-experience-and-gear)

**Cyclepath PDX Writer [ELITE]:** "I love under-biking, riding MTB trails on the Mog has always been fun, but I had never done a descent like that before. I probably rode the brakes too much, but I wasn't willing to take major risks... I ended up having to pull aside three times to let riders with more capable skills and bikes fly by me. 25 minutes. Not my best, but I kept it upright." (https://www.cyclepathpdx.com/blogs/news/grinduro-2025-experience-and-gear)

**John Watson [COMPETITIVE]:** "The pendulum swung wide with Grinduro in 2019, amassing 2000 riders. And yet, 2025's turnout felt more true to spirit – intimate, like a family reunion. All one can hope is that people will go out and spread the word of just how good this event (still) is." (https://theradavist.com/2025-grinduro)

**John Watson [COMPETITIVE]:** "Events that are less focused on stats and rankings, that encourage camping, a social atmosphere, and unforgettable course routing, will always have a place in cycling. Gravel races killed gravel, but Grinduro proves that nostalgia wins." (https://theradavist.com/2025-grinduro)

**Claudia Gerosa [COMPETITIVE]:** "This is where Grinduro brings such a refreshing attitude compared to many other gravel events - it's more about jaw-dropping scenery, great conversations with the other riders and top-rate feed stations than all-out competition." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-grinduro-italia-2023)

**Claudia Gerosa [COMPETITIVE]:** "Stopping for lunch in the middle of a ride felt like a very foreign concept – it was definitely more substantial than the usual rushed mid-ride coffee. But you know what, I could get used to it. It was a lesson in taking time to enjoy a well-earned break in a stunning location with great food." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-grinduro-italia-2023)

**Iggy95 [RECREATIONAL]:** "My first real experience with multiple-mile-long 30mph gravel descents. Holy shit what an absolute blast! It felt like time stood still, just totally in the moment. Anyway the race was awesome, super well organized and they provided so much food I barely even dented my snacks." (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/1dcmw3i/my_first_gravel_race_grinduro_pa/)

**Carl Decker [COMPETITIVE]:** "It was cool having the team looking good in the same kit and bikes, all of us similarly paced, ending up close together in the results. Moving forward, to do these kinds of events with guys of similar speed, excited to learn about new events and new places, it's a fun time to be on the Giant Factory Off-Road Team." (https://www.giant-bicycles.com/us/the_road_to_grinduro)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Tire Width & Pressure [ELITE]:** Cyclepath PDX writer ran 47mm Specialized Pathfinder Pro tires at around 28 PSI, then dropped pressure going into the first downhill segment. Noted: "I flatted due to a small sidewall cut, that I plugged after the fact, but I am pretty sure I would have been able to rip it a little harder if I had wider tires and a suspension fork that hardtail MTB would provide." (https://www.cyclepathpdx.com/blogs/news/grinduro-2025-experience-and-gear)

**Gearing [ELITE]:** ENVE Mog equipped with SRAM Eagle AXS shifting, 42t chainring with 10-52t cassette. "Needed every tooth to get up some of the steep climbs." (https://www.cyclepathpdx.com/blogs/news/grinduro-2025-experience-and-gear)

**Crank Length [ELITE]:** "I've been riding 170mm for the longest time, and made the switch this year to 160mm cranks... I've found myself being able to spin up steep climbs that maybe once required me to get off and walk. I'm certainly not fitter, so I'll attribute it to the 10mm difference of being able to turn over the cranks." (https://www.cyclepathpdx.com/blogs/news/grinduro-2025-experience-and-gear)

**Flat Repair [ELITE]:** "I carry two Dynaplugs with me on every ride. One in my ride wallet... and one in my saddle bag (or in the case of my Mog, in the downtube storage). If the sealant doesn't do it's job, a quick jab and I'm on my way. Putting a tube in is a last resort, and I avoided that once again." (https://www.cyclepathpdx.com/blogs/news/grinduro-2025-experience-and-gear)

**Chain Maintenance [ELITE]:** "I am a fan of Silca Chain Wax... While we had not put in the amount of miles that would have warranted a fresh drip of chain wax, it was dry, it was dusty, and my chain was squeaking by mile 40. I relented and used some oil at the final aid station." (https://www.cyclepathpdx.com/blogs/news/grinduro-2025-experience-and-gear)

**Bike Type Considerations [ELITE]:** "Overall, my experience at Grinduro was amazing, but there is room for improvement... Suspension would be nice. Grinduro is not explicitly labeled as a 'mountain bike' nor a 'gravel' race. Based on my observation, more people seemed to be on gravel bikes. While it was great for the MAJORITY of the ride, in the parts that it mattered, namely the two downhill stages, I really would have appreciated the comfort of front suspension." (https://www.cyclepathpdx.com/blogs/news/grinduro-2025-experience-and-gear)

**E-MTB for Photography [COMPETITIVE]:** John Watson documented the race on a Mondraker Crafty RR e-MTB in Eco mode all day, still had 41% battery life left with Bosch PowerMore 250. "What I really like about documenting races via e-MTB versus moto or car is that I don't dust the racers out with 2-stroke fumes or plumes of dirt." (https://theradavist.com/2025-grinduro)

**Tire Evolution:** John Watson noted from 2015: "The first year at Grinduro, most were on the 40 mm WTB Nano tires." By 2025, tire clearance has significantly increased. (https://theradavist.com/2025-grinduro)

**Touring Bike Viability [UNKNOWN]:** Reddit user Less_Clock_395 asked about bringing a Surly MS with rack and fenders, concerned about looking "weird around a lot of fancy gravel bikes." (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/1czj7o3/grinduro_pennsylvania_bike_advise/)

## Weather Experienced

**Mt. Shasta 2023 [RECREATIONAL]:** Niky Taylor described "pretty warm morning" with concerns about "layering, should I wear this vest or not???" and noted it was "very hot" with 90 degree weather. Matt wore "a base layer under his skin suit even though it was very hot." (https://www.altovelo.org/blog/race-report-grinduro-2023)

**Italy 2025 [UNKNOWN]:** Gravel Cyclist video noted "Temperatures on event day (June 14, 2025) were very hot, around 94F / 34C." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/videos/2025-grinduro-italy-crazy-italian-gravel-race-party/)

**Italy 2023 [COMPETITIVE]:** Claudia Gerosa mentioned "The first part didn't have any shade, but the second part went in and out of the woods." The finish area had "Ice cream and beer... basically on tap" suggesting warm conditions. (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-grinduro-italia-2023)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Mt. Shasta 2023 Course [RECREATIONAL]:** Niky Taylor: "It's about 62 miles and a whole bunch of climbing (7k?) and it's mostly gravel and singletrack (and a bit of road) and it's great. The race segments were 1) gravel descent, 2) road TT, 3) gravel climb, 4) singletrack mostly descent." Segment 1 was "pretty sketchy." Segment 4 was "flowy downhill singletrack and THAT was an outright blast." (https://www.altovelo.org/blog/race-report-grinduro-2023)

**Quincy 2025 Course [ELITE]:** Cyclepath PDX: "Full Grinduro (52 mi / 7,300 ft) and Grindurito (28 mi / 3200 ft)." Stage 3 was "a downhill dirt road, with plenty of rocks and ruts that required some navigation." Final stage was "a 5.6 mile descent of over 2,200 feet... I love under-biking, riding MTB trails on the Mog has always been fun, but I had never done a descent like that before." (https://www.cyclepathpdx.com/blogs/news/grinduro-2025-experience-and-gear)

**Pennsylvania [RECREATIONAL]:** Iggy95: "63 miles /5300ft elevation... multiple-mile-long 30mph gravel descents" on the Green dot route (less techy singletrack). (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/1dcmw3i/my_first_gravel_race_grinduro_pa/)

**Italy 2023 Course [COMPETITIVE]:** Claudia Gerosa: "Stage 1 – La Zinghera Hill Climb: 2.8 km climb with 160 metres of vertical gain... in the forest on rough and pretty loose gravel." Stage 2: "3.7 km fast, techy descent on rough gravel and churned-up stones." Stage 3: "3.8 km... up and down through the woods, a jungle of emotions with real flow... threading the bike over roots and between the trees." Stage 4: "1.7 km... Fast and dusty... With exposed roots and lots of sand, it was signature Mediterranean style riding." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-grinduro-italia-2023)

**Italy 2023 Pre-Stage:** The Spaghetti Climb "looks exactly like it sounds – hairpin after hairpin, with some flat sections thrown in... led us up Monte Arsenti, which is where all the local MTB descents start." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-grinduro-italia-2023)

**Surface Variety:** Claudia Gerosa: "if you'd come to Grinduro Italy thinking you'd be cruising exclusively along classic Tuscan strade bianche you would have been in for a shock. As promised, it delivered virtually every surface imaginable... Sand, rocks, wooded bits, flow sections, stony trails and tarmacked back roads." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-grinduro-italia-2023)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Relaxed Start [RECREATIONAL]:** Niky Taylor: "We actually weren't really on the start line and it was pretty casual because the way Grinduro works you can kinda just roll out slow with the group... I don't think anyone pushed their limits because it wasn't a race section." (https://www.altovelo.org/blog/race-report-grinduro-2023)

**Social Nature [RECREATIONAL]:** Niky Taylor: "There were a lot of aid stations. We stopped at them. But not together. Cam does not believe in stopping during rides. So he would stop like 2 seconds and then take off again." (https://www.altovelo.org/blog/race-report-grinduro-2023)

**Time Commitment [ELITE]:** Cyclepath PDX: "At the end of the day, I was only 'racing' for 1 hour, in what was a 7+ hour day from roll out to finish line. There is so much support along the way with aid stations, you can't help but stop and enjoy the refreshments, the scenery, and the community." (https://www.cyclepathpdx.com/blogs/news/grinduro-2025-experience-and-gear)

**Nutrition Strategy [ELITE]:** Cyclepath PDX: "While well supported with aid stations along the route, I never went thirsty nor hungry. But I am particular when it comes to fueling. I like high carb drink mixes, and the aid station coolers had what tasted to me like they were stretching the bags of electrolyte mix to the max. I barely carried any food, but I would definitely bring my own packets of Skratch High-Carb Mix to make sure I was actually filling my bottles with 50g carbs." (https://www.cyclepathpdx.com/blogs/news/grinduro-2025-experience-and-gear)

**Nutrition [RECREATIONAL]:** Niky Taylor: "I ate a lot of watermelon and bananas and I made my own applesauce+maple syrup gel and it was a lot of sugar." (https://www.altovelo.org/blog/race-report-grinduro-2023)

**Race Format Understanding:** Niky Taylor: "The most important thing is that overall I beat Cam by 4 seconds. Alex probably beat both of us by like 10 minutes or something." This shows the timed segment format creates close racing even with different overall pacing. (https://www.altovelo.org/blog/race-report-grinduro-2023)

**Lunch Stop [COMPETITIVE]:** Claudia Gerosa in Italy: "Stopping for lunch in the middle of a ride felt like a very foreign concept... But you know what, I could get used to it... After more chat and more food, we leisurely got back onto our bikes and continued on to the next timed segment." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-grinduro-italia-2023)

**Descent Management [ELITE]:** Cyclepath PDX on the final 5.6 mile descent: "I had a good buffer before and after to not have to pass or be passed by anyone... I probably rode the brakes too much, but I wasn't willing to take major risks... I was doing everything I could to not have to pull over and give my fingers a break. I ended up having to pull aside three times to let riders with more capable skills and bikes fly by me." (https://www.cyclepathpdx.com/blogs/news/grinduro-2025-experience-and-gear)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Crashes [RECREATIONAL]:** Niky Taylor: "Will, with his unwavering focus, showcased his technical skills and effortlessly crashed on a tricky section of the first descent/segment 1. He pulled out of the race but is ok." (https://www.altovelo.org/blog/race-report-grinduro-2023)

**Timing Chip Issues [RECREATIONAL]:** Niky Taylor: "Alex... would have gotten second in his age group, but sadly he and Matt both DNF'd because their timing chips didn't scan correctly on the stage 2 road TT." (https://www.altovelo.org/blog/race-report-grinduro-2023)

**Mechanical - Sidewall Cut [ELITE]:** Cyclepath PDX: "While descending, I could feel my tire bottoming out and not wanting to destroy my rim or overall race, I pulled over and pumped my tire twice, poor timing for a mechanical. It wasn't until after the segment was over and at the aid station that I noticed a small cut in my sidewall, so I popped a Dynaplug in and made sure the tire held the same PSI for a bit before rolling on." (https://www.cyclepathpdx.com/blogs/news/grinduro-2025-experience-and-gear)

**Heat & Hydration [RECREATIONAL]:** Niky Taylor noted "Janene... should maybe run 2 bottle cages in 90 degree weather" suggesting hydration management is critical in hot conditions. (https://www.altovelo.org/blog/race-report-grinduro-2023)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Party Atmosphere [RECREATIONAL]:** Niky Taylor: "Matt was blasting music from a bluetooth speaker" and won the award for "Most Dad" for "riding the whole thing with classic rock blasting from a bluetooth speaker." (https://www.altovelo.org/blog/race-report-grinduro-2023)

**Post-Race [RECREATIONAL]:** Niky Taylor: "The post-race celebration was fun. First we took a group picture without Will. Then we found Will back at the Airbnb and wrapped him in plastic (Tegaderm). Alex went to jam to music at the event, the rest of us got pizza and then joined him." (https://www.altovelo.org/blog/race-report-grinduro-2023)

**Weekend Festival [ELITE]:** Cyclepath PDX: "Beyond the actual 'race', it was a weekend of camping at the Quincy Fairgrounds, with plenty of food, beer, (but no free coffee) and entertainment to keep you occupied while you weren't on the bike." (https://www.cyclepathpdx.com/blogs/news/grinduro-2025-experience-and-gear)

**Inclusive Format [RECREATIONAL]:** Niky Taylor: "This was a super fun weekend and I highly recommend Grinduro to anyone interested in riding/racing gravel. It's a super inclusive and great format for a race." (https://www.altovelo.org/blog/race-report-grinduro-2023)

**Return to Roots [COMPETITIVE]:** John Watson: "Now there are more kids around, fewer photos of whisky bottles... 2025's turnout felt more true to spirit – intimate, like a family reunion... The weekend includes Grinduro on Saturday, then a Mount Hough Enduro race on Sunday. Due to time constraints, I could only document Grinduro. All in, the weekend drew around 450 signups – not the numbers the organizers were hoping for, but the bigger picture here is important to contextualize." (https://theradavist.com/2025-grinduro)

**Finish Line Vibe [COMPETITIVE]:** Claudia Gerosa: "The vibe back at the finish was really welcoming, with everyone waiting for the rest to finish. Ice cream and beer were basically on tap and everyone seemed really happy with how the day went." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-grinduro-italia-2023)

**Sunday Recovery Ride:** Claudia Gerosa: "Sunday's Hangover ride suited those who had enjoyed a bit more of a good night's sleep (such as me) – or are simply indefatigable – and gave the perfect opportunity to spin the legs socially on some local singletrack. Wahoo, one of the event's sponsors, provided coffee and croissants at a gorgeous spot beside the harbour in Portiglione." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-grinduro-italia-2023)

**Organizer Description:** Giant Bicycles: "Grinduro is not just a bike race. It's a celebration of cycling with as much emphasis on the fun as the ride, with excellent food, an impressive display of art, live music, camping and a festival atmosphere." (https://www.giant-bicycles.com/us/the_road_to_grinduro)

**Philosophy [COMPETITIVE]:** John Watson: "Part camping, part party, a hard course, and a laid-back atmosphere with nighttime entertainment for all to enjoy... There are so many gravel races these days, but few, if any, capture Grinduro's intent." (https://theradavist.com/2025-grinduro)

**Social Transfers [COMPETITIVE]:** Claudia Gerosa: "One natural split happened to form two groups and it was clear that some of cycling's usual competitiveness was inevitable." But also: "everyone was chatting and no one was in a major hurry, so we rolled along at a good pace." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-grinduro-italia-2023)
