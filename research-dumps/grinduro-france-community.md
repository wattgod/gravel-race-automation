# GRINDURO FRANCE — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Paul Errington [ELITE]:** "Stage 3 was the technical singletrack stage. As a group of riders stands at the start of the stage discussing the absence of Stage 2 downhill legend Wyn Masters drops in and cleans the first section easily before disappearing into the stage. Inspired by such a display the next rider starts. Not more than a bike length after the timing box, he hits a rock square on, sending him flying over the bars." (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-grinduro-france-goes-down-a-storm-in-the-vosges)

**Paul Errington [ELITE]:** "Stage 4 of course :-) The up and down stage. It was long into the day's riding, but everything left in the legs needed to be left here, hoping that the riding after the timed stage would allow for an easier return back to the finish. The long drag at the start was then met by a fork in the trail and a misread on my Wahoo put me down the wrong trail for a moment... Nearing the end of the stage, I dropped my chain but not wanting to waste time stopping it was time to tuck and carry as much speed as possible. Stage 4 done. My dropped chain had turned into a snapped chain, but was quickly remedied with a spare link and I was back off again." (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-grinduro-france-goes-down-a-storm-in-the-vosges)

**Paul Errington [ELITE]:** "My day would be spent riding with Martin from Leatt, a Grinduro Global sponsor. This showcased the true genius of Grinduro - although we had been able to complete a very differing amount of climbing practice in the lead-up to the event, we could still enjoy each other's company as there was no pressure to complete the course in any specified time." (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-grinduro-france-goes-down-a-storm-in-the-vosges)

**Julien Sommier [UNKNOWN]:** "Le parcours nous a menés à travers la Réserve Naturelle Nationale du Frankenthal-Missheimle et la Réserve Biologique Dirigée de la Haute-Meurthe. Rouler dans ces espaces protégés a été un vrai bonheur. Nous avons traversé des forêts magnifiques, longé des rivières, et profité de panoramas grandioses sur le massif vosgien, atteignant deux fois les 1100 m d'altitude." (https://weelz.ouest-france.fr/jetais-au-grinduro-france-une-epopee-gravel-dans-les-vosges/)

**Julien Sommier [UNKNOWN]:** "Au final, les stats de mon Wahoo affichaient 95,72 km pour 2251 m de dénivelé positif. Pas de podium cette fois-ci, malgré trois trophées en descente sur Strava. J'ai laissé la place aux meilleurs, avec un besoin de muscler mon jeu en côte." (https://weelz.ouest-france.fr/jetais-au-grinduro-france-une-epopee-gravel-dans-les-vosges/)

**Julien Sommier [UNKNOWN]:** "Comme le parcours n'était pas entièrement chronométré, le départ s'est fait dans le calme, sans la frénésie des courses gravel traditionnelles. Le rythme « party pace » convenait à tout le monde, jusqu'à la première ascension, où le groupe s'est étiré naturellement." (https://weelz.ouest-france.fr/jetais-au-grinduro-france-une-epopee-gravel-dans-les-vosges/)

**James Deane (Grinduro Global):** "Nous sommes ravis de nous rendre dans le magnifique massif des Vosges. L'endroit possède tous les ingrédients pour faire du Grinduro France, un événement parfait. Les tracés sont magnifiques et les paysages époustouflants." (https://lecycle.fr/actualites/grinduro-levenement-gravel-alternatif-debarque-en-france/49379/)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Stage 1 - The Climbing Stage [ELITE perspective]:** "As always, the stage start approaching is indicated by the recognisable purple event signage and a sweeping right-hand bend sends us passed the timing box and it's game on. Initially on tarmac, a tempered effort is needed to succeed on this 3km climbing stage. However, no sooner has a rhythm been found when the tarmac gives way to gravel and measuring grip and choosing line gets thrown into the mix. Just short of 14 minutes of effort and the stage is over." (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-grinduro-france-goes-down-a-storm-in-the-vosges)

**Stage 3 - Technical Singletrack [ELITE perspective]:** "When Grinduro was dreamt up as an event it was always meant to find the absolute limits of a gravel bike and this stage definitely aimed to do that. Finding myself in one piece at the end felt like a win." First section had rocks that sent riders over the bars, causing some to walk through this initial technical section. (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-grinduro-france-goes-down-a-storm-in-the-vosges)

**Stage 2 - Fast Downhill [ELITE perspective]:** "Somewhat confusingly placed after Stage 3, this was the fast downhill stage, or at least it eventually was, as after a full-gas start, the trail started to climb and instant regret set in regarding the initial pace. After the short climbing interlude concluded the descending started and it was fast double track, rough in parts but careful line choice allowed a lot of speed to be carried." (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-grinduro-france-goes-down-a-storm-in-the-vosges)

**Course Overview:** "The track features a selection of the best mountain biking routes and gravel trails in the gorgeous Vosges region." Located in Xonrupt-Longemer area. (https://gravel.shimano.com/stories/grinduro-2024-preview)

**Actual Distance & Climbing [UNKNOWN level rider]:** 95.72 km with 2,251m of elevation gain (as measured on Wahoo). Course reaches 1,100m altitude twice. (https://weelz.ouest-france.fr/jetais-au-grinduro-france-une-epopee-gravel-dans-les-vosges/)

**Course Structure:** Two 50km loops allowing riders to return to event village for lunch midway through. Course passes through Réserve Naturelle Nationale du Frankenthal-Missheimle and Réserve Biologique Dirigée de la Haute-Meurthe. (https://weelz.ouest-france.fr/jetais-au-grinduro-france-une-epopee-gravel-dans-les-vosges/)

**Terrain Mix [from Germany event, similar format]:** "With a combination of gravel roads, forest tracks, steep singletrack, deep mud, exposed roots and paved minor roads, the Grinduro Germany parcours promised something for everyone." (https://gravelunion.cc/article/turning-the-forest-purple-at-grinduro-germany)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**General Grinduro Strategy:** "The timed segments have the added effect of taking the pressure off the start. Get into your ride with a nice chat and find your zone, your sweet spot, to burst when the time is right. Or don't, it's up to you." (https://gravel.shimano.com/stories/grinduro-2024-preview)

**Timing Format:** "A long loop of pavement and dirt, with finishing times based on four timed segments of seven to five minutes each." Each timed stage requires 5-7 minutes of effort. (https://gravel.shimano.com/stories/grinduro-2024-preview)

**Energy Management [ELITE perspective]:** "By the time lunch had been served, we had covered over 50km of the planned 100km loop, but had also completely well over 1700m of climbing, indicating (hopefully) that the afternoon would be a touch easier." Stage 4 described as needing "everything left in the legs." (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-grinduro-france-goes-down-a-storm-in-the-vosges)

**Pacing Approach [UNKNOWN level]:** "Le rythme « party pace » convenait à tout le monde, jusqu'à la première ascension, où le groupe s'est étiré naturellement" - The 'party pace' suited everyone until the first climb where the group naturally stretched out. (https://weelz.ouest-france.fr/jetais-au-grinduro-france-une-epopee-gravel-dans-les-vosges/)

**Time on Bike [UNKNOWN level]:** "Environ 5 à 6 heures à pédaler, sans comptabiliser les pauses" - approximately 5-6 hours of pedaling for 100km in gravel, not counting breaks. One rider reported 5h30 total ride time. (https://weelz.ouest-france.fr/objectif-grinduro-france-100-km-de-gravel-mon-format-prefere/ and https://weelz.ouest-france.fr/jetais-au-grinduro-france-une-epopee-gravel-dans-les-vosges/)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Mechanical Issues [ELITE perspective]:** "Nearing the end of the stage, I dropped my chain but not wanting to waste time stopping it was time to tuck and carry as much speed as possible. Stage 4 done. My dropped chain had turned into a snapped chain, but was quickly remedied with a spare link and I was back off again." (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-grinduro-france-goes-down-a-storm-in-the-vosges)

**Mid-Race Bail Option:** Organization provided option for riders to stop after morning loop: "For some riders, the morning's exertions are perfectly enough and they decide to spend the afternoon chilling out in the event village, but for anyone with energy left, the afternoon loop is ready and waiting." (https://gravelunion.cc/article/turning-the-forest-purple-at-grinduro-germany)

**Crash Risk on Technical Sections [ELITE perspective]:** Stage 3 technical singletrack caused at least one rider to go over the bars "not more than a bike length after the timing box" and multiple riders chose to walk the opening section. (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-grinduro-france-goes-down-a-storm-in-the-vosges)

One rider mentioned "une bonne tartiflette" and "Une part de tarte aux myrtilles pour le dessert" - good tartiflette and blueberry tart for dessert. (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-grinduro-france-goes-down-a-storm-in-the-vosges and https://weelz.ouest-france.fr/jetais-au-grinduro-france-une-epopee-gravel-dans-les-vosges/)

Mechanical support provided by Shimano & Schwalbe at feed stations. (https://gravelunion.cc/article/turning-the-forest-purple-at-grinduro-germany)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Tire Selection Matters [ELITE perspective, from Germany event]:** "Timo's stunning looking Open U.P.P.E.R. (which weighs a mind blowing 7 kg) was set up with Shimano GRX Di2 in a 1x11 set-up, with very minimally treaded tyres and on the faster sections of the course he was flying, while I struggled to hold his wheel. On the muddy or steeper sections of the course, my 2x11 GRX Di2 set-up and more heavily treaded tyres paid dividends though and I was able to create a gap." (https://gravelunion.cc/article/turning-the-forest-purple-at-grinduro-germany)

**No Perfect Bike:** "If you search online for the question 'What is the right bike for Grinduro?' you'll get some impressively varied responses and that is part of the charm of the event... For this reason alone, we don't think there is a perfect bike for Grinduro." (https://gravelunion.cc/article/turning-the-forest-purple-at-grinduro-germany)

**Bike Variety Observed:** "The variety of bikes used at the event was as varied as the course – everything from 1990's 26" wheeled mountain bike with v-brakes to an amazing long wheelbase GinkGo cargo bike to top-of-the-range gravel race bikes. The uniform factor seemed to be that no matter what bike they were riding, everyone was having a good time!" (https://gravelunion.cc/article/turning-the-forest-purple-at-grinduro-germany)

**Tubeless Recommended [UNKNOWN level]:** One rider specifically noted checking "la pression de mes pneus, tubeless oblige" - tire pressure, tubeless being necessary. (https://weelz.ouest-france.fr/jetais-au-grinduro-france-une-epopee-gravel-dans-les-vosges/)

**Spare Chain Links Essential [ELITE perspective]:** "My dropped chain had turned into a snapped chain, but was quickly remedied with a spare link and I was back off again." (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-grinduro-france-goes-down-a-storm-in-the-vosges)

**Mudguards Practical:** "Unlike my experience in The Netherlands a few weeks previously, I received less strange looks and quietly muttered comments about my choice of full-mudguards and in fact I spotted a few fender-friends dotted at intervals around the course. They were easy to spot as they were the ones with clean faces and arses!" (https://gravelunion.cc/article/turning-the-forest-purple-at-grinduro-germany)

**GRX Groupset Promoted:** Event sponsor Shimano heavily promotes GRX gravel groupset: "At Grinduro, look for the Shimano booth to test the awesome power of GRX yourself!" Multiple riders mentioned using GRX Di2 setups. (https://gravel.shimano.com/stories/grinduro-2024-preview)
