## SUMMARY OF GAPS

The provided search results contain limited information specifically about Grinduro France. Key missing data includes: 2025-2026 specific race dates, registration fees, participant numbers, detailed course breakdown, climate specifics, logistics (airports, lodging, parking), and community feedback. The search results confirm Grinduro France's inaugural 2024 running and general Grinduro event format, but do not provide the comprehensive depth requested. Additional targeted searches specifically for "Grinduro France 2025," "Grinduro France 2026," rider reports, and event forum discussions would be necessary to complete this research.
