# GRINDURO GERMANY — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Loek Luijbregts (Fatpigeon.cc) [COMPETITIVE]:** "If you go down to the woods today, you're sure of a big surprise... While there might not have been any bears (or picnics) at the recent Grinduro Germany, there certainly was a dinosaur, some amazing trails and a hell of a party." (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-grinduro-germany2023)

**Loek Luijbregts [COMPETITIVE]:** "The Schwalbe prologue... proved to be a true sufferfest. With gradients reaching up to 30%, riders were pushed to their limits as they navigated steep climbs and descents. Many riders were forced to dismount and walk their bikes up the steepest sections, although a handful managed to keep pedalling." (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-grinduro-germany2023)

**Amanda Chudobey-Berger [ELITE]:** "If I had to give a name to my style of gravel cycling it would be: Gravel Madness... Everything about it is just so much fun: the technicality, the speed, the vibe, and the beautiful places your gravel bike can take you." (https://www.argon18.com/en/stories/grinduro-germany-recap-this-is-my-ride-with-amanda-chudobey-berger)

**Amanda Chudobey-Berger [ELITE]:** "Unfortunately the weather was quite brutal, with heavy rain and cold winds that started the night before the race and kept up throughout the day, until late afternoon. The moment you got out of your tent in the morning, you were already faced with the rainy weather. Luckily, around 12:00 the sun started to peak through the clouds as the rain slowly faded away."

**OriginalJimDog [UNKNOWN]:** "I went to Grinduro Germany last September. Apart from the rain (of which there was a LOT), the event was a super fun experience. My friend and I are definitely not competitive riders and although the course had a lot of climbs, we both enjoyed it." (https://www.reddit.com/user/OriginalJimDog/)

**Nick (finance professional from Jersey, England) [UNKNOWN]:** Made a handmade sign asking for a ride from the event to the Netherlands. The FatPigeon crew picked him up and he "shared with us his gravel inspiration about riding on the island of Jersey and the nearby coast of France." This exemplified the camaraderie and shared experiences that make gravel events special. (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-grinduro-germany2023)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Amanda Chudobey-Berger [ELITE]:** Used and recommends the Argon 18 Grey Matter: "Furthermore, one does not need a very high-end bike in order to enjoy a ride out in nature. Argon 18's Grey Matter is a perfect example of a bike that can take you out in the mountains and on gnarly trails. You can rely on its capability to be shredded, in gravel events and also on bikepacking trips." (https://www.argon18.com/en/stories/grinduro-germany-recap-this-is-my-ride-with-amanda-chudobey-berger)

**OriginalJimDog [UNKNOWN]:** "Definitely no perfect bike for Grinduro, you'll curse your choice at some point on the route!" (https://www.reddit.com/user/OriginalJimDog/)

**2022 Edition (Amanda Chudobey-Berger) [ELITE]:** "The weather was quite brutal, with heavy rain and cold winds that started the night before the race and kept up throughout the day, until late afternoon." Rain began to fade around 12:00, with sun appearing later. "The warm sun eventually came out, its light shining through the trails and beaming off of the puddles and wet leaves."

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Format Strategy [ALL LEVELS]:** "The race is timed, but only on four specific segments, including climbs, descents, and flat sections. This unique format enables riders to enjoy a more relaxed pace between timed segments, allowing them to take in the scenery, socialise with fellow riders and save their energy for the race's more challenging parts." Each timed segment is approximately 5-7 minutes. (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-grinduro-germany2023, https://gravel.shimano.com/stories/grinduro-2024-preview)

**Start Strategy [ALL LEVELS]:** "The timed segments have the added effect of taking the pressure off the start. Get into your ride with a nice chat and find your zone, your sweet spot, to burst when the time is right. Or don't, it's up to you." The mass start "feels somehow more like a celebration of the joy of being out there with friends." (https://gravel.shimano.com/stories/grinduro-2024-preview)

**OriginalJimDog [UNKNOWN]:** At Grinduro PA (similar format): "you seem to eat your way around the course... there was everything from fries and cheesesteaks to ice cream last year!" Suggests similar food availability at other Grinduro events. (https://www.reddit.com/user/OriginalJimDog/)

**Saturday Night Rave:** "Saturday night saw DJs MulderOnTheDanceFloor and 8000Watt hosting a one-of-a-kind Grinduro rave that kept the crowd dancing for hours.

(https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-grinduro-germany2023)

**Amanda Chudobey-Berger [ELITE]:** "Grinduro is known for being as much about community as it is about racing. This type of inclusive and fun vibe is another reason why I like gravel riding. The gravel community can be quite awesome, where you find people encouraging each other and helping each other in gravel events and rides."
