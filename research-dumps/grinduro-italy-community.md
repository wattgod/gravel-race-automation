# GRINDURO ITALY — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Paul Errington [COMPETITIVE]:** "Stage 1 - the flat-out gravel road. Let a few other riders go to have something to aim for. A seated 40 km/h as the back wheel shifts violently side to side through deeper looser gravel. Pass three riders, but then one comes back round. Someone to work with at least. Make a left-hand turn and pass again the rider, but they throttle back so now alone, the road points slightly uphill, so dig a bit deeper. Left turn and now flat out again. Sat on the rivet of the saddle. Can see a few riders up ahead so measure the effort to catch them and then finish. Ouch! The effort is felt." (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-la-dolce-vita-meets-the-purple-party-at-grinduro-italy)

**Paul Errington [COMPETITIVE]:** "Stage 2, the 'Canyon', a singletrack descent. This is where any time I have made on the previous stage can be comfortably lost for me. I haven't pre-ridden the course, so I have no idea what is about to come next between the start and the finish line. There is a group of riders at the start line each affording the one in front a comfortable gap. I watch ex World Cup XC MTB rider Marco Fontana sprint into the stage on his flat bar Scott gravel bike. Maybe this stage is less techie than I thought? The stage is initially a little wider than singletrack and is rocky. On a 40mm tyre and drop bars speed is your friend as you try and stay on top of everything. Then the canyon part starts. A high banked singletrack trails snakes downhill in a quick succession of turns. My time loss through this stage is palpable and towards the end I have to give up my line for a faster rider. Not the fastest ride through this section but one I hugely enjoyed." (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-la-dolce-vita-meets-the-purple-party-at-grinduro-italy)

**Paul Errington [COMPETITIVE]:** "Stage 3, the road climb. Though not the 'funnest', this was likely to be my best stage. A road climb of just short of 4km at a gradient that afforded a decent gear. Out the saddle from the start then settle into a pace just on the uncomfortable side but maintainable. Plenty of riders on the climb to work through and one that seemed to be a much slower catch, so they were the focus. Final out the saddle effort as the finish comes in to sight and then it was time to zone out again and look for more Fiat Pandas." (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-la-dolce-vita-meets-the-purple-party-at-grinduro-italy)

**Paul Errington [COMPETITIVE]:** "Stage 4, the XC vibe stage. Let's get this wrapped up. As I rolled up on the start line, riders were prepping - emptying their bottles and lowering tyre pressures. I opted for a more casual approach and just dived straight in. After a few metres I was already hanging a foot out to make an off-camber turn, then sprinting when the track straightened. Without the descending prowess of many, my approach was more brute force. As flat out as possible when the terrain allowed to average out the slower more considered approach to the technical elements or slower turns. I was deeply confused when confronted by a hard right turn into a river crossing which likely dashed any hope of a higher standing in the results." (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-la-dolce-vita-meets-the-purple-party-at-grinduro-italy)

**Paul Errington [COMPETITIVE]:** "I was blown away by how much great singletrack had been packed in to the route. Everything had such a great flow to it and with a little rain in the preceding days, the dirt was just perfect." (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-la-dolce-vita-meets-the-purple-party-at-grinduro-italy)

**Claudia Gerosa [COMPETITIVE]:** "Stage 2 – Marsiliana Down Hill - A 3.7 km fast, techy descent on rough gravel and churned-up stones, this was a test of line choice that put both bike and wrists through the wringer. I am a big fan of descents and even though I took a few risks, I loved every metre of it – In fact, I even won this segment in my category!" (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-grinduro-italia-2023)

**Claudia Gerosa [COMPETITIVE]:** "Stage 3 – Montioni Jungle Singletrack - At 3.8 km, this segment had a bit of everything - up and down through the woods, a jungle of emotions with real flow. I've never tried enduro, but definitely think it could become my thing as I really enjoyed threading the bike over roots and between the trees" (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-grinduro-italia-2023)

**Claudia Gerosa [COMPETITIVE]:** "Stage 4 – Le Api Down Country - Fast and dusty, this 1.7 km segment demanded full concentration. With exposed roots and lots of sand, it was signature Mediterranean style riding." (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-grinduro-italia-2023)

**Claudia Gerosa [COMPETITIVE]:** "I'm not sure what the rest of the participants were expecting, but if you'd come to Grinduro Italy thinking you'd be cruising exclusively along classic Tuscan strade bianche you would have been in for a shock. As promised, it delivered virtually every surface imaginable and gave us the chance to push ourselves and our skills on Maremma's challenging terrain. Sand, rocks, wooded bits, flow sections, stony trails and tarmacked back roads." (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-grinduro-italia-2023)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**[COMPETITIVE] Paul Errington's setup:** Rode on 40mm tyres with drop bars. Notes that "On a 40mm tyre and drop bars speed is your friend as you try and stay on top of everything" on the rocky, technical sections. (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-la-dolce-vita-meets-the-purple-party-at-grinduro-italy)

**[ELITE] Marco Fontana (ex World Cup XC MTB rider):** Rode a flat bar Scott gravel bike, which Paul Errington observed sprinting into Stage 2. Scott showcased "a performance flat bar gravel bike" at the event village, potentially inspired by the technical nature of the course. (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-la-dolce-vita-meets-the-purple-party-at-grinduro-italy)

**[UNKNOWN LEVEL] Pre-stage prep observed:** Before Stage 4, riders were "emptying their bottles and lowering tyre pressures" at the start line, suggesting technical terrain ahead where lower pressure was advantageous. (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-la-dolce-vita-meets-the-purple-party-at-grinduro-italy)

**Official gear recommendations [UNKNOWN LEVEL]:** "The ultimate setup is probably a disc brake-equipped gravel bike with fast-rolling, tubeless tires of around 700x40c. Be prepared with at least two extra tubes, a multi-tool and mini-pump... We recommend mountain bike pedals and shoes for their versatility." (https://gravelunion.cc/article/grinduro-italy-2023)

**Weather gear [UNKNOWN LEVEL]:** "Although we'll be in Italy, we are on the coast, so be prepared for rain showers just in case. Take a rain jacket and the basics—ideally arm/leg warmers too—just in case weather rolls in." (https://gravelunion.cc/article/grinduro-italy-2023)

## Weather Experienced

**2024 edition (Paul Errington):** "With a little rain in the preceding days, the dirt was just perfect." (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-la-dolce-vita-meets-the-purple-party-at-grinduro-italy)

**2023 edition (Claudia Gerosa):** No rain mentioned during the event itself. Stage 4 described as "fast and dusty" with "lots of sand." The first part of Spaghetti Climb "didn't have any shade" suggesting hot, sunny conditions. (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-grinduro-italia-2023)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Stage 1 characteristics [COMPETITIVE - Paul Errington]:** "The flat-out gravel road" with "deeper looser gravel" that causes the back wheel to shift "violently side to side." Includes slight uphill sections and left-hand turns. Riders can maintain ~40 km/h seated. (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-la-dolce-vita-meets-the-purple-party-at-grinduro-italy)

**Stage 2 "The Canyon" [COMPETITIVE - Paul Errington]:** "Initially a little wider than singletrack and is rocky." Then transitions to "a high banked singletrack trails snakes downhill in a quick succession of turns." Significant time can be lost here by those not proficient at technical descending. (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-la-dolce-vita-meets-the-purple-party-at-grinduro-italy)

**Stage 3 road climb [COMPETITIVE - Paul Errington]:** "Just short of 4km at a gradient that afforded a decent gear" - suggesting moderate, sustainable gradients rather than ultra-steep pitches. (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-la-dolce-vita-meets-the-purple-party-at-grinduro-italy)

**Stage 4 XC-style [COMPETITIVE - Paul Errington]:** Includes "off-camber turns," requires sprinting when terrain straightens, and features a surprise "hard right turn into a river crossing." Technical elements and slower turns mixed with flat-out sections. (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-la-dolce-vita-meets-the-purple-party-at-grinduro-italy)

**2023 Stage 1 - La Zinghera Hill Climb [COMPETITIVE - Claudia Gerosa]:** "2.8 km climb with 160 metres of vertical gain was in the forest on rough and pretty loose gravel." (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-grinduro-italia-2023)

**Spaghetti Climb [COMPETITIVE - Claudia Gerosa]:** "Hairpin after hairpin, with some flat sections thrown in... the first part didn't have any shade, but the second part went in and out of the woods with a lot of zig-zags. It led us up Monte Arsenti, which is where all the local MTB descents start." (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-grinduro-italia-2023)

**Course not typical Tuscany [COMPETITIVE - Claudia Gerosa]:** "If you'd come to Grinduro Italy thinking you'd be cruising exclusively along classic Tuscan strade bianche you would have been in for a shock... Sand, rocks, wooded bits, flow sections, stony trails and tarmacked back roads." (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-grinduro-italia-2023)

**Technical emphasis:** "An area well known for its mountain biking, holding Grinduro Italia here was always going to offer riding on the more technical side of the gravel spectrum." Event village included "an onsite MTB skills loop and pump track." (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-la-dolce-vita-meets-the-purple-party-at-grinduro-italy)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**[COMPETITIVE] Transition sections strategy (Paul Errington):** "When transitioning between stages at a Grinduro you can get lost in the mix a little. The transition sections are not timed so you can relax, chat to other riders, take in the views, spot another Fiat Panda 4x4 for the 100th time that day, wonder if you could drive one back to the UK and then the next stage is upon you." (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-la-dolce-vita-meets-the-purple-party-at-grinduro-italy)

**[COMPETITIVE] Stage 1 pacing (Paul Errington):** "Let a few other riders go to have something to aim for" - using other riders as pace targets. Maintained seated 40 km/h efforts, working with another rider when possible, then going solo with measured efforts to catch visible riders ahead. (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-la-dolce-vita-meets-the-purple-party-at-grinduro-italy)

**[COMPETITIVE] Stage 3 pacing (Paul Errington):** "Out the saddle from the start then settle into a pace just on the uncomfortable side but maintainable. Plenty of riders on the climb to work through and one that seemed to be a much slower catch, so they were the focus." Uses slower riders ahead as motivation/pacing targets. (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-la-dolce-vita-meets-the-purple-party-at-grinduro-italy)

**[COMPETITIVE] Stage 4 strategy (Paul Errington):** "Without the descending prowess of many, my approach was more brute force. As flat out as possible when the terrain allowed to average out the slower more considered approach to the technical elements or slower turns." - Compensating for technical skill gaps with power where possible. (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-la-dolce-vita-meets-the-purple-party-at-grinduro-italy)

**[COMPETITIVE] Lunch break (Claudia Gerosa):** "Stopping for lunch in the middle of a ride felt like a very foreign concept – it was definitely more substantial than the usual rushed mid-ride coffee. But you know what, I could get used to it. It was a lesson in taking time to enjoy a well-earned break in a stunning location with great food... Again, no one was in a hurry." Suggests the mid-day break is genuinely relaxed, not a rushed feed stop. (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-grinduro-italia-2023)

**Feed station timing:** First feed station after Stage 1, another before Stage 2, another after Stage 2 descent, with lunch at midpoint. "There will be feed zones (and an excellent lunch!), but smart riders will bring at least two water bottles and their favorite nutritional supplies." (https://gravelunion.cc/article/grinduro-italy-2023)

**Pre-ride reconnaissance:** Optional Friday afternoon "Schwalbe shakedown ride" gives "an appetiser of what was to come." (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-grinduro-italia-2023)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Core ethos [Paul Errington - COMPETITIVE]:** "Even though the years have passed since the creation of Grinduro, the vibe still remains the same. Arrive, have a coffee, have a beer, meet old friends, make new friends, enjoy another beer, listen to some cool music, get matching tattoos, ride some bikes. It's the Grinduro way. Performance with party. Competitively social!" (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-la-dolce-vita-meets-the-purple-party-at-grinduro-italy)

**Start line atmosphere [Claudia Gerosa - COMPETITIVE]:** "Come 9 a.m. on Saturday, we were lined up excitedly. The route began with a tarmac back road that led us to the first segment. Everyone was chatting and no one was in a major hurry, so we rolled along at a good pace. One natural split happened to form two groups and it was clear that some of cycling's usual competitiveness was inevitable." (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-grinduro-italia-2023)

**Feed station culture [Claudia Gerosa - COMPETITIVE]:** First feed station "hosted by a beautiful agriturismo and riders were offered espresso and cake, along with stunning views out to the Mediterranean... It was a lesson in taking time to enjoy a well-earned break in a stunning location with great food. So, why not indulge in a glass of wine from the very same ground where you're riding too?" (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-grinduro-italia-2023)

**Finish line atmosphere [Claudia Gerosa - COMPETITIVE]:** "The vibe back at the finish was really welcoming, with everyone waiting for the rest to finish. Ice cream and beer were basically on tap and everyone seemed really happy with how the day went. Of course, given that we're a bunch of cyclists who've raced segments throughout the day without knowing any results, there was definite anticipation ahead of the prize ceremony, which preceded dinner and the disco on the beach." (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-grinduro-italia-2023)

**Saturday night party [Paul Errington - COMPETITIVE]:** "It was then time to enjoy the equally matched party element. Good music, fun people and a lively bar. With an early exit planned on Sunday morning to drive back to the UK, my approach was more reserved than other Grinduro Saturday parties I have attended, but it was no less enjoyable." (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-la-dolce-vita-meets-the-purple-party-at-grinduro-italy)

**Event village atmosphere:** "The event village was populated by the series supporters, with Shimano also taking care of the coffees for the weekend with a top-notch barista... Leatt, Odlo, Wahoo, Gravel Union and Crank Brothers were also in attendance... An extended stop as we wait for the afternoon's stages to be open, so there's no harm in enjoying another coffee while waiting." (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-la-dolce-vita-meets-the-purple-party-at-grinduro-italy)

**Sunday Hangover Ride:** "Sunday's Hangover ride suited those who had enjoyed a bit more of a good night's sleep (such as me) – or are simply indefatigable – and gave the perfect opportunity to spin the legs socially on some local singletrack. Wahoo, one of the event's sponsors, provided coffee and croissants at a gorgeous spot beside the harbour in Portiglione." (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-grinduro-italia-2023)

**Inclusivity focus:** "Grinduro is all about fun, you can race for the win if you choose, or you can take the ride with your friends and take it easy. You decide how to ride Grinduro as it is an event for everyone!" (https://gravelunion.cc/article/grinduro-italy-2023)

**"Perfect party to race ratio":** Repeatedly described as the defining characteristic of the event, with emphasis on the social experience being equal to or greater than the competitive element. (https://gravel.shimano.com/stories/grinduro-2024-preview)

**Grindurito option:** "A fun non-competitive 50 km ride (not timed/scored) with that same fabulous cruise back along the coastal trails and same great party finish" - providing an option for those who want the party without the full race intensity.
