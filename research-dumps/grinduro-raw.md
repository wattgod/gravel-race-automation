## OFFICIAL DATA

### What is Grinduro?

Grinduro is a unique hybrid race format combining gravel racing with mountain bike enduro-style timed segments. The name is a portmanteau: **Gravel + Enduro = Grinduro**.

**Core Concept:**
- One long loop of pavement, gravel, and dirt (typically 60-100km / 37-62 miles)
- Finishing times based on **4 timed segments** (each 5-15 minutes), NOT overall loop time
- Untimed "liaison" sections between stages allow social riding at conversational pace
- Festival atmosphere with camping, live music, gourmet food, and bike expo

**Official Website:** https://grinduro.com

### Race Format Explained

**Timed Segments:**
- 4 timed stages per event
- Each segment: 5-15 minutes of intense effort
- Segments reward "the most well-rounded of rouleurs" with varied terrain
- Typically includes: climbing segments, technical descents, singletrack, fast fire-roads

**Liaison Sections (Untimed):**
- Designed for social riding and recovery
- Often feature the most scenic parts of the course
- Aid stations and feed zones located in liaison sections
- No time pressure - ride hard or cruise with friends

**Results Calculation:**
- Sum total of all 4 timed segment times = final result
- Only need to make cutoffs for each stage
- Overall loop time is irrelevant

**Why This Format Works:**
- "Fully satisfy that competitive itch, then regroup with your mates and chat your way to the start of the next segment"
- Takes pressure off the start - find your zone before bursting when the time is right
- Accessible to casual riders while still competitive for racers
- First-time racers and pros ride the same course

## FORUM INSIGHTS

### Rider Experience Reviews

**Overwhelmingly Positive:**
- "Without a doubt, Grinduro was the most fun I've ever had with drop bars"
- "Grinduro incorporated all the reasons I love riding bikes - friends, racing, beautiful scenery, awesome trails/roads, and lots of good food and laughs"
- "The unique format of the event was awesome, its the perfect mix between party and difficult"

**Community Atmosphere:**
- "In a famously tribal community, Grinduro creates a space where pros and beginners ride the same course, share the same struggles, and celebrate the same achievements"
- "Elitism has no place here - everyone is welcome"
- "The feel in the field was as welcoming and relaxed as it was on the trail"

**Format Appreciation:**
- "Because the timed sections were only a tiny part of the overall ride time it was the first 'race' I'd never heard anyone losing their shit after being stuck behind another rider"
- "From the moment you arrive, Grinduro radiates a festival-like energy"
- "Riders set up vibrant tented communities while live music plays"

### Bike Choice Forum Debates

**The Grinduro Dilemma:**
- "The first three segments were biased towards pedaling hard and going fast, making riders lean towards a gravel bike set up as light as possible"
- "In contrast, the last timed segment would probably have been best tackled on a full suspension mountain bike with a dropper post"
- "The course would be rather well suited to a mountain bike. With conditions as wet and muddy as they were, I was definitely missing some much-needed grip"

**Tire Discussions (MTBR Forum):**
- Tubeless mandatory
- 40mm+ minimum width recommended
- 700c or 650b both valid
- WTB Vulpine, Resolute 50, Nano 52 commonly recommended

**Dropper Post Debate:**
- Increasingly popular for Grinduro
- 50-125mm travel typical for gravel (vs 210mm MTB)
- PNW Coast 100mm frequently mentioned
- "Can't remember what it was like to descend long rough gravel roads without it"

### Registration/Value Discussion

**Entry Fees:**
- PA 2024: $220 Grinduro / $180 Grindurito
- Scotland: ~£150
- Includes: meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner), camping, music, expo access

**Forum Consensus:**
- Higher than typical sportives but includes festival experience
- Comparable to major events (Unbound $130-200+)
- "If it's worth it, pay it. If it isn't, don't"

## BLACK PILL

### The Brutal Truths About Grinduro

**1. Flat Tire Epidemic**
- "Both years now there have been a significant number of people on the sidelines fixing flats all through the course"
- "Tubeless was the only choice for this rugged route, and those who rode clinchers with tubes paid the price with flat after flat throughout the day"
- "There were dozens of flat tires, particularly on the final timed segment"
- Course pre-ride once had 9 flats including on support vehicles

**2. Equipment Failures**
- "Most importantly, I had no mechanicals. Any gravel event where you don't flat or break something is a success in my book"
- Sidewall cuts common on rocky sections
- Poor timing for mechanicals during timed segments means losing valuable time

**3. Course Difficulty Underestimated**
- "The courses may only be 100 km / 60 miles, but it's a crusher"
- "Roughly 70-percent of the course is on dirt"
- "The first half of the ride was lovely... wasn't ready for the second half to be death"
- Heat, dehydration, and long steep climbs break riders

**4. Wrong Bike, Wrong Day**
- Most riders on smaller tires "clearly struggling with grip on steep, loose pitch"
- "Rider after rider spun out and were forced to dismount"
- Gravel bike vs MTB dilemma is real - no perfect choice exists
- "Course would be rather well suited to a mountain bike"

**5. Weather Roulette (Especially Scotland)**
- "Cold rain, wind, mud, and more rain"
- Can transform course into skating rink of mud
- Riders "practically turned into chocolate cake"
- Tires useless in wet conditions some years

**6. Cutoff Times Are Real**
- One rider finished 2.5 hours after cutoff
- "Super sad when she thought she wasn't allowed to finish"
- Tears of disappointment for stragglers told they've missed cutoff
- Last 12 miles can feel "terrible"

**7. Brexit/Bureaucracy Nearly Killed UK Events**
- "Forestry Commission charges restricted where they could go while making the event financially viable"
- Sponsors hit with unexpected customs fees post-Brexit
- Forced to take a year off
- "Sponsor market was significantly more interested in Europe"
- Finding private estates to host events required

**8. Not Actually a "Chill" Event**
- Despite festival vibes, course is legitimately brutal
- "62-mile course consisted primarily of dirt and gravel mountain roads and included 8,000 feet in elevation gain"
- China Grade climb: average 10%, sections over 20%, scary cliff drop-offs
- Technical MTB singletrack challenges many gravel riders

**9. Festival Logistics**
- Remote locations mean limited services
- Camping in fairgrounds, not hotels
- Ferry crossings required (Scotland Isle of Arran)
- Medical certificate required (Italy)

**10. Price vs. Value Debate**
- $220+ entry fee is steep for single-day event
- Camping included but basic
- Some feel it's worth it; others don't

Grinduro is not just a race - it's a celebration of cycling culture that happens to include competitive elements. The format is genuinely innovative, solving gravel racing's fundamental problem: how to maintain the fun while still having meaningful competition.

The timed segment format allows Type-A racers to scratch their competitive itch while giving everyone else permission to enjoy the scenery, chat with fellow riders, and actually have fun on their bikes.

The black pill truths are real - flats are endemic, weather can be brutal, and courses are genuinely difficult - but these challenges are part of what makes finishing a Grinduro meaningful. It's not a Gran Fondo in fancy dress; it's a proper test of bike handling, fitness, and equipment reliability.

**Should you do a Grinduro?**

If you love cycling culture, enjoy mixed terrain, can handle technical riding, and want more than just a race - absolutely yes. Grinduro represents the best of what gravel events can be: challenging, communal, and genuinely fun.
