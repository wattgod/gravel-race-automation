# GRUSK — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Jason Anderson [UNKNOWN]:** "Those later hours (or the witching hours as some people like to call them), are really where I'm learning that I thrive. I find it easy to lock in and just keep moving forward through the darkness. Something about it is calming. The rhythmic nature of pedaling with just a tunnel of light ahead, no distractions, and no concept of the passing time makes the miles go by quick." (https://oceanandsan.com/blogs/journal/grusk-race-recap)

**Jason Anderson [UNKNOWN]:** "These ultra events are something of an eating contest on two wheels haha. I use a lot of sports nutrition in the way of in-bottle calories/carb mix and gels. Outside of that I also keep a lot of bars, candy, and pre-packaged pastries on me... A cold coke and a hot meal always hits different when you're +10 hours in." (https://oceanandsan.com/blogs/journal/grusk-race-recap)

**Jason Anderson [UNKNOWN]:** "Man, I just really love riding my bike for extended amount of time. Being out all day and then some is my absolute favorite... I like to refer to them as a moving meditation. They really are good for the spirit. You don't get that same effect through fast races." (https://oceanandsan.com/blogs/journal/grusk-race-recap)

**Natalie Barron [UNKNOWN]:** "I had planned to ride [the timed sections] hard, but I just had to SAIL that plan and ended up riding with some friends, making some new friends, chatting with Frank Giresi on course, and enjoying the day." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/natalies-story-grusk)

**Natalie Barron [UNKNOWN]:** "The course is mixed surface, with the majority of the gravel segments well groomed, with the exception of Forest Road, which was a challenging double track rocky uphill followed by the 'grassy downhill,' which had rock, root, mud, and ruts. I stopped near the end to snap a picture to remind myself that I can do hard things and I'm getting better at gravel skills." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/natalies-story-grusk)

**Jess Daddio [ELITE]:** "My alarm woke me some five hours later, feeling more tired than I had the night before. It was still raining... Despite my gnawing hunger, I had to force an egg burrito down. The coffee, I couldn't even touch. What was making me feel so anxious? I wasn't in it to win it. Was it the weather? My layers? The course? The 5,286 feet of climbing ahead?" (https://www.blueridgeoutdoors.com/go-outside/gravel-race-grusk/)

**Jess Daddio [ELITE]:** "Riding along Gandy Creek felt like a dream... The sun had finally broken through the clouds, and the day was cool and beautiful. Long, paved, and steady, the climb wasn't terrible. Bordered on all sides by thick spruce and fir with clear blue sky above, I almost forgot about how hard the climb was, until the last few miles." (https://www.blueridgeoutdoors.com/go-outside/gravel-race-grusk/)

**Jess Daddio [ELITE]:** "The descent off of Spruce Knob was not nearly as effortless as I had imagined. Small and deceptively punchy climbs snuck up on me." (https://www.blueridgeoutdoors.com/go-outside/gravel-race-grusk/)

**Deb [COMPETITIVE]:** "We got incredibly lucky when the weeklong heatwave broke just in time for the ride. The temperature at the start of the race was 72° and sunny with reasonable humidity, gradually climbing to 87° by the time we finished... the east-coast drought left the roads extremely dusty. With more cars than anticipated kicking up dust, we were absolutely filthy when we cruised across the finish line." (https://debruns.com/2024/10/01/grusk-gravel-ride-up-spruce-knob-race-recap/)

**Deb [COMPETITIVE]:** "One gravel road had recently been paved with what looked like West Virginia coal – the surface was much chunkier and rougher than regular asphalt." (https://debruns.com/2024/10/01/grusk-gravel-ride-up-spruce-knob-race-recap/)

**Deb [COMPETITIVE]:** "The nutrition I had at aid station 2 really saved my butt. I stuffed my mouth full of pickles, took some with me (yes, I was eating pickles and trying to pedal as fast as possible up the road, I'm sure it was a funny sight), and one my friends/volunteers at the aid station gave me a bottle full of coke. Sugar and salt made for quite the revival." (https://debruns.com/2024/10/01/grusk-gravel-ride-up-spruce-knob-race-recap/)

**Kelly Paduch [ELITE]:** "When GRUSK started, I immediately slotted myself in a good spot, stuck on the front, and knew I was feeling good as we hit the first climb. My heart rate was high, but not maxed. My legs felt quick and responsive. I even felt like I could recover the tiniest little bit as I pedaled behind a few people." (https://www.rocktownbicycles.com/blog/2019/7/14/grusk-2019)

**Kelly Paduch [ELITE]:** "That grassy downhill was crazy. During the racers meeting before the race, the organizer suggested riders stick to the grass instead of the deep ruts made by the forest service trucks, as the possibility of getting stuck and wrecking could be high. I quickly figured out though, that the best place to ride was actually in those tire ruts. The grass was so slick and wet from the rain that it took a lot to stay in control." (https://www.rocktownbicycles.com/blog/2019/7/14/grusk-2019)

**Kelly Paduch [ELITE]:** "The whole race I had been pedaling scared - knowing that there were strong women behind me. It's a funny thing to know you're in front. You can't let up, and you can't have any problems." (https://www.rocktownbicycles.com/blog/2019/7/14/grusk-2019)

**Wiehan [UNKNOWN]:** "My biggest obstacle on the day actually came earlier in the day and related more to my bike, rather than the route. At about the 25-mile (40km) marker, I experienced my first dropped chain as we descended into a valley... In total, my chain shook out of place five times, and I was kicking myself for not fitting the Wolftooth Gnarwolf chainguide." (https://mountain-road.com/blog/gravelride-grusk)

**mooviescribe [COMPETITIVE]:** "I'm in my 50s. During better weather, I typically ride three or four 20-30 mile rides each week (rails to trails type) on the old bike, and also usually hit the hilly mountain bike trails here in WV once every couple of weeks or so... I'm not a very skilled trail rider, but can handle beginner to intermediate type trails." (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/sq1mxt/question_about_grusk/)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**[UNKNOWN - Wiehan]:** "I was kicking myself for not fitting the Wolftooth Gnarwolf chainguide that I've reviewed in the past to the bike. This was a hard lesson to learn, but I don't think I'll pitch up at any races in the future without this product fitted to my bike. The wasted energy that I spent getting back into the fast-moving bunches certainly would have been helpful over those last few miles." Experienced 5 dropped chains during the race. (https://mountain-road.com/blog/gravelride-grusk)

**[ELITE - Jess Daddio]:** Wore an insulated Giro vest for early morning cold/rain conditions at 4,000+ feet elevation. Started with shorts, short-sleeved jersey, and rain jacket but needed the additional insulation. (https://www.blueridgeoutdoors.com/go-outside/gravel-race-grusk/)

**[COMPETITIVE - mooviescribe]:** Considering using either a 90s steel-framed Bridgestone MB4 with Jones bar and gravel tires (used for touring/long rides) or a Santa Cruz Chameleon hardtail with 29-inch wheels for the shorter distances, noting the hardtail is "not comfortable for long rides." (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/sq1mxt/question_about_grusk/)

**[ELITE - Kelly Paduch]:** Road bikes with skinny tires were used by top five Epic 73-mile riders who passed others despite having ridden 20 more miles. (https://www.rocktownbicycles.com/blog/2019/7/14/grusk-2019)

## Weather Experienced

**2017:** "Rain poured from the sky, whipping every which way in the wind" on Friday night before race. Race morning "still raining, but just light enough that you questioned whether it was worth bringing a rain jacket. Fog hung low in the trees." Weather improved during race: "By the time we spilled out into Whitmer, the weather was sublime (minus the headwind-on-pavement)." Final verdict: "The sun had finally broken through the clouds, and the day was cool and beautiful." (https://www.blueridgeoutdoors.com/go-outside/gravel-race-grusk/)

**2019:** Rain throughout the week leading up to race. Kelly Paduch reports: "All week the area had been by torrential downpours. Flash floods had taken out roads and damaged the small towns that lay along the race route." Race day had on/off rain in morning with "super fast rolling gravel roads, with just a slight rain mist - perfect temperatures." Grass was "so slick and wet from the rain." (https://www.rocktownbicycles.com/blog/2019/7/14/grusk-2019)

**2024 (July 13):** "We got incredibly lucky when the weeklong heatwave broke just in time for the ride. The temperature at the start of the race was 72° and sunny with reasonable humidity, gradually climbing to 87° by the time we finished." East-coast drought conditions made roads "extremely dusty." (https://debruns.com/2024/10/01/grusk-gravel-ride-up-spruce-knob-race-recap/)

**2022 (July):** "Muddy, foggy and super fun!!" (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/vvpmbj/grusk_muddy_foggy_and_super_fun/)

**General elevation note:** "Spruce Knob, the Mountain State's highest point... was notoriously cold, wet, and windy even in the dead of summer" at 4,000+ feet elevation. (https://www.blueridgeoutdoors.com/go-outside/gravel-race-grusk/)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Spruce Knob climb:** "Long, paved, and steady, the climb wasn't terrible. Bordered on all sides by thick spruce and fir with clear blue sky above, I almost forgot about how hard the climb was, until the last few miles. In the distance, the summit parking lot rose high above, looking ever-so-faint between the trees. Talk about despair." Final section: "The grade stiffened... Thank gahd for granny gears." (https://www.blueridgeoutdoors.com/go-outside/gravel-race-grusk/)

**Grassy downhill section:** "Super crazy 2 mile double track grass descent." Race director suggested "riders stick to the grass instead of the deep ruts made by the forest service trucks, as the possibility of getting stuck and wrecking could be high." However, one elite rider found "the best place to ride was actually in those tire ruts. The grass was so slick and wet from the rain that it took a lot to stay in control." (https://www.rocktownbicycles.com/blog/2019/7/14/grusk-2019)

**Forest Road:** "Challenging double track rocky uphill followed by the 'grassy downhill,' which had rock, root, mud, and ruts." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/natalies-story-grusk)

**Post-summit descent:** "The descent off of Spruce Knob was not nearly as effortless as I had imagined. Small and deceptively punchy climbs snuck up on me." (https://www.blueridgeoutdoors.com/go-outside/gravel-race-grusk/)

**Overall surface:** "The majority of the gravel segments well groomed" with roads "sprinkled with the typical potholes and washboards." One road "had recently been paved with what looked like West Virginia coal – the surface was much chunkier and rougher than regular asphalt." (https://debruns.com/2024/10/01/grusk-gravel-ride-up-spruce-knob-race-recap/)

**Gandy Creek section:** "Riding along Gandy Creek felt like a dream." Followed by "eight-mile Dry Fork climb from the valley floor." (https://www.blueridgeoutdoors.com/go-outside/gravel-race-grusk/)

**Cattle encounter:** "We crossed a cattle guard and soon came upon a herd of cattle" on course. (https://debruns.com/2024/10/01/grusk-gravel-ride-up-spruce-knob-race-recap/)

**Start:** "Starts with a super rough dirt road, then a gravel downhill, a climb, and then this super crazy 2 mile double track grass descent to the next gravel road." First 2 miles "mostly downhill... dodging large rocks and washed out ruts for the first mile." (https://www.rocktownbicycles.com/blog/2019/7/14/grusk-2019)

**Medio 50 climb profile:** "The first climb began two miles in when for the next ten miles we would climb 1,228 feet working our way up to Spruce Knob." Summit at 12.3 miles. "After summiting Spruce Knob we were treated to nearly 25 miles of mostly downhill soaring while dropping 2,157 feet." Final climb: "gained 1,317 feet over the next 15 miles." (https://debruns.com/2024/10/01/grusk-gravel-ride-up-spruce-knob-race-recap/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**[UNKNOWN - Jason Anderson] Ultra-distance strategy (260 miles):** "Strategy for these things are always loose, knowing that anything can happen, at any time. I try not to get too tied to a plan for that reason. Being able to adapt and re-strategize on the fly are super important in these longer races in order to avoid digging yourself into any kind of mental hole. You just need to keep in mind that first and foremost, you're here to have fun." Used 2 resupply stops at mile 80 and mile 170, hitting burger joints for "only 'real food' during the entirety of the ride." Maintained "regular caffeine and food consumption" during night hours. (https://oceanandsan.com/blogs/journal/grusk-race-recap)

**[ELITE - Jess Daddio] 52-mile strategy:** "I bypassed the first aid station, then the second. The miles came blissfully fast." Stopped at third aid station "where I downed my remaining water and filled up on Swedish Fish and peanut M&Ms." Key decision: "I had seen second place just after leaving that aid station and knew I had to keep the hammer down to put distance between myself and her." Mental approach: "Pedaling alone again... my head was filled with Eminem songs (not my first choice, but it's what popped up and kept repeating), and a mantra of 'you want this, go harder, you can't slow down.'" (https://www.blueridgeoutdoors.com/go-outside/gravel-race-grusk/)

**[COMPETITIVE - Deb] 54-mile strategy:** Stayed with husband for duration while "constantly playing catchup with a friend." Stopped at aid station 2 around mile 36: "I stuffed my mouth full of pickles, took some with me... and one my friends/volunteers at the aid station gave me a bottle full of coke. Sugar and salt made for quite the revival." Moving time 5:05:47, net time 5:55:53 for 54.49 miles with 4,262 feet gain. (https://debruns.com/2024/10/01/grusk-gravel-ride-up-spruce-knob-race-recap/)

**[ELITE - Kelly Paduch] 55-mile strategy:** Positioned aggressively at start: "I immediately slotted myself in a good spot, stuck on the front." Found group after grassy downhill and "rode mostly by myself" from halfway point on. "Skipped the first aid station, holding out for the 2nd aid station after the Dry Run Rd climb and 10 miles to go to the Spruce Knob Summit." On final descent: "changing my mantra to 'don't flat, go fast but don't flat.'" (https://www.rocktownbicycles.com/blog/2019/7/14/grusk-2019)

**Start positioning advice [ELITE - Kelly Paduch]:** "I wanted to be as close to the front for the start of the race as possible. It starts with a super rough dirt road, then a gravel downhill, a climb, and then this super crazy 2 mile double track grass descent to the next gravel road. Starts at gravel and cross races always have me on edge... I knew even with a 'neutral' rollout to the first climb, being aggressive and getting positioned well was going to be really important for how the rest of my day went." (https://www.rocktownbicycles.com/blog/2019/7/14/grusk-2019)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Chain drops:** Multiple riders experienced dropped chains. One rider had 5 chain drops starting at mile 25, requiring "fight my way back into a fast-moving bunch" each time. Rider specifically recommended fitting a Wolftooth Gnarwolf chainguide to prevent this issue. (https://mountain-road.com/blog/gravelride-grusk)

**Navigation errors:** One aid station ran out of water (though more was on the way). (https://debruns.com/2024/10/01/grusk-gravel-ride-up-spruce-knob-race-recap/)

**Course marking confusion:** "There were 3 timed sections on the course, but they turned out to be mostly not marked." Another rider reported: "Somehow when I got to a critical turn that distinguished my route from the shorter 25 mile route, I missed the turn to the lake. My element did not tell me to turn... Didn't help that the volunteers also told us to go the wrong way." This resulted in 5 extra miles and backtracking. Course marking used "light blue dots" vs "solid grey line" which caused confusion. (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/natalies-story-grusk and https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/14wohlh/how_did_i_screw_up/)

**Grassy descent crashes:** High crash risk noted on 2-mile grassy double-track descent, especially in wet conditions. "The possibility of getting stuck and wrecking could be high." One rider nearly taken out by another who "cut across me, and then almost took me out." (https://www.rocktownbicycles.com/blog/2019/7/14/grusk-2019)

**Flat tires:** Multiple reports of "too many flat tires to count." (https://www.blueridgeoutdoors.com/go-outside/gravel-race-grusk/)

**Weather-related issues:** Flash floods in 2019 "had taken out roads and damaged the small towns that lay along the race route" requiring last-minute reroutes. (https://www.rocktownbicycles.com/blog/2019/7/14/grusk-2019)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Live music and after-party:** "Live music starts at 6pm Fri and 6pm Sat" with "Post-Race dinner - starts at 2pm." (https://www.mountainrides.net/grusk) Multiple sources describe the after-party as exceptional: "when the afterparty is touted as one of the best, count us in!" (https://debruns.com/2024/10/01/grusk-gravel-ride-up-spruce-knob-race-recap/)

**Post-race amenities:** "Great after party with really good lasagna, a band, and free beer." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/natalies-story-grusk) Another source: "The Chaga Tea Project tunes and spaghetti dinner brought us back to life." (https://www.blueridgeoutdoors.com/go-outside/gravel-race-grusk/)

**On-course support:** "The relief in their voices was contagious, reenergizing. And that's when something struck me—I had seen very few women coming down from the summit... Most everyone I passed smiled and shouted words of encouragement." Later: "I whooped and hollered and tried to keep the climbing racers' spirits up as they made the long slog to the summit." (https://www.blueridgeoutdoors.com/go-outside/gravel-race-grusk/)

**Rider camaraderie:** "Ended up riding with some friends, making some new friends, chatting with Frank Giresi on course, and enjoying the day." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/natalies-story-grusk) Another: "The caliber of athletes that showed (and the wide range of ages on the podium) was awesome to witness." (https://www.blueridgeoutdoors.com/go-outside/gravel-race-grusk/)

**Event philosophy:** Advertised as "largely noncompetitive" with "no overall or age group winners; however, segments are broken into Strava challenges." (https://debruns.com/2024/10/01/grusk-gravel-ride-up-spruce-knob-race-recap/) Promoted as "people come for the gravel, but find a family." (https://debruns.com/2024/10/01/grusk-gravel-ride-up-spruce-knob-race-recap/)

**Venue atmosphere:** "Live music added to the lively atmosphere that surrounds this race, and with so many of the racers camping out at the start venue, things could only get more entertaining. The buzz surrounding this race was energizing indeed." (https://mountain-road.com/blog/gravelride-grusk)

**Race day stories:** "Bull chases and cowboys, too many flat tires to count, glorious gravel, out-of-this-world scenery, perfect weather, lasting camaraderie. The race was an adventure in and of itself." (https://www.blueridgeoutdoors.com/go-outside/gravel-race-grusk/)

**Camping:** Venue offers "$15 per person for entire weekend" camping and limited dorm bunks at $30/night. "Campfire Friday & Saturday nights." (https://www.mountainrides.net/grusk) One rider: "Best campsite this side of the Mississippi." (https://www.blueridgeoutdoors.com/go-outside/gravel-race-grusk/)

**Charitable aspect:** "This event helps support the work of the Experience Learning, Inc.'s Spruce Knob Mountain Center, the local emergency management organizations and fire departments, and the West Virginia University Amateur Radio Club." Features "Charity Raffle - 6pm." (https://debruns.com/2024/10/01/grusk-gravel-ride-up-spruce-knob-race-recap/ and https://www.mountainrides.net/grusk)

**Local race feel:** "GRUSK feels like a local race. Local in that it's close to my home, and it's a big honor to win this event. The race director knows what's up with good roads, and a proper gravel race - some support but not a whole lot, beautiful venue, and challenging and fun to ride terrain." (https://www.rocktownbicycles.com/blog/2019/7/14/grusk-2019)
