# GUN FLINT 44 — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Critical Finding: Wrong Event in Sources

**IMPORTANT:** The sources provided are about two completely different events:

1. **Gunflint Mail Run** - A dog sledding race in Minnesota
2. **Gun Flint 44** - Appears to be referenced as a gravel cycling race

The majority of sources (1-2, 9-16) discuss dog mushing, flintlock guns, Minecraft gravel mechanics, and unrelated topics. Only sources 3-4 contain actual gravel cycling race information, but they are about "The Gunflint Scramble" - a trail running event, NOT a gravel cycling race called "Gun Flint 44."

**No usable community insights about a "Gun Flint 44" gravel/cycling race exist in these sources.**

## What the Sources Actually Contain

### Dog Sledding Race (Gunflint Mail Run)
Multiple detailed race reports about sled dog racing in the Gunflint Trail area of Minnesota, including:

**Erin Altemus [COMPETITIVE - dog musher]:** "The best and worst of times... I drew bib number one. We were ready to go for the 7 p.m. start... when the trail forked, I called a quick 'Ha!' to go left, but the team veered right, and I dug my brake into the glare ice beneath the fresh, loose snow. It must have taken 100 yards to make them stop—12 extremely hyped up bundles of pulling power... losing about 40 minutes of time in the process."

**Erin Altemus [COMPETITIVE - dog musher]:** "By the time we left for the second leg at 8 a.m., three teams had scratched from the race. It was -17 with reports of a -40 degree wind chill... On Devil's Track Lake, the team in front of me started veering on a trail to shore, but my leaders went the right way, again picking up speed it seemed as we headed into the wind, a 30 mph headwind that made my face burn."
