# GUNNI GRINDER — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**jamesdanielosborne [COMPETITIVE]:** "I've had multiple friends tell me it is one of the hardest days they've ever had on a bike. Relentless climbs (including that big one near the end) and some roads are very rough. It can also still be very hot in Gunnison this time of the year." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/gunni-grinder-2023-colorado/86583)

**Nick Gould (referenced) [ELITE]:** "If he has a hard day, we're all gonna have a hard day." Context: Nick is described as "no joke" and a professional gravel biker. His Strava data showed it was a challenging ride for him. (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/gunni-grinder-2023-colorado/86583)

**plindley [UNKNOWN]:** "I attempted the 120 last year and made it 30 miles before I turned around on my final plug. Had 4 flats in those miles and didn't want to attempt the rest of it with no more plugs. Some really nice smooth sections of gravel at the beginning but then there were hard packed spots with SHARP rocks that kept tearing my tires open. I saw a lot of folks with flats besides me." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/gunni-grinder-2023-colorado/86583)

**plindley [UNKNOWN]:** "Overall though it was pretty although I heard the people who completed it mentioned it was a lot of the same over and over but idk that's most gravel races imo." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/gunni-grinder-2023-colorado/86583)

**DMC [COMPETITIVE]:** "I did read someone's recap on it from last year via a friend on Strava and it resembled what you said: Basically climb for 20-30 minutes of rough gravel, descend down rough gravel, go through sand, do it again 3-4 times." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/gunni-grinder-2023-colorado/86583)

**plindley [UNKNOWN]:** "My skin did not peel off my hands and didn't feel like it was going to anytime soon, so yes I'd say better than Co2Ut" (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/gunni-grinder-2023-colorado/86583)

**Betsy Welch [COMPETITIVE]:** "Turns out that the race was A) really hard, B) I was still really life-tired, or C) both. During post-race beer commiseration, MTB legend and IMBA president Dave Wiens assured me the answer was A, which made me feel moderately better." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/the-grind-a-not-quite-farewell-to-gravel/)

**Betsy Welch [COMPETITIVE]:** "The scenery over the 120-mile course was staggeringly beautiful, with early hints of autumn blushing in the hills and terrain that ranged from 'pedaly' to fast to downright chunder." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/the-grind-a-not-quite-farewell-to-gravel/)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**plindley [UNKNOWN]:** "If I were to do it again I would definitely use inserts and maybe up the PSI and maybe ride more carefully." Context: After experiencing 4 flats in 30 miles on sharp rocks. (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/gunni-grinder-2023-colorado/86583)

**Jason Sumner [RECREATIONAL]:** General weather pattern described: "Generally speaking, the area's summertime weather is amazing, with sunny skies and comparatively mild temperatures... But we also see our fair share of variability, meaning it might be 70°F (21°C) and sunny in Crested Butte when you start your ride, but raining and 50°F (10°C) a few hours later when you reach the high alpine summit."

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Neil Beltchenko [RECREATIONAL]:** "Covering 119 miles over two days is a demanding endeavor. However, around 80 miles of the route consist of well-graded and well-maintained gravel roads, leaving riders with only 33 miles of two-tracks, routes, and steep roads to navigate." (https://bikepacking.com/routes/gunni-grinder/)

**Neil Beltchenko [RECREATIONAL]:** "With the majority of the route is relatively easy technical riding, but there are a few sections, specifically towards the end, where the roads get challenging enough that you may need to jump off your bike." (https://bikepacking.com/routes/gunni-grinder/)

**plindley [UNKNOWN]:** "Some really nice smooth sections of gravel at the beginning but then there were hard packed spots with SHARP rocks that kept tearing my tires open." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/gunni-grinder-2023-colorado/86583)

**Jason Sumner [RECREATIONAL]:** Regarding the Gunni 30 route: "Overall the road gradient is never terribly steep (typically in the 3-4% range), save for the final two miles (3.2 km) of ascending, which frequently pitch upwards at 9-10%." (https://zenocycleparts.com/blogs/cyclingtips/glorious-gravel-grinding-in-colorado-s-gunnison-county)

**Jason Sumner [RECREATIONAL]:** "The day we rode, conditions ran the gamut, from buttery smooth road to molar-loosening braking bumps, to one narrow road section near the end of the main climb that was littered with softball-size embedded rocks." (https://zenocycleparts.com/blogs/cyclingtips/glorious-gravel-grinding-in-colorado-s-gunnison-county)

**Official Course Info [UNKNOWN]:** "Some of these roads receive little to no maintenance and can change drastically after heavy rains and/or snowfall." (https://www.thegunnigrinder.com)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**oldandfast [COMPETITIVE]:** Posted Strava data showing climbing and pacing from a strong rider (Nick Gould), acknowledging "If he has a hard day, we're all gonna have a hard day." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/gunni-grinder-2023-colorado/86583)

**Neil Beltchenko [RECREATIONAL]:** "This route is rated as a 6 out of 10 for overall difficulty if ridden as an overnighter. Stretch it to three days and that goes down a notch or two." (https://bikepacking.com/routes/gunni-grinder/)

**Neil Beltchenko [RECREATIONAL]:** "Another factor to consider is the higher altitude, which might pose a challenge for folks coming from out of state, as they'll likely feel the effects of the elevation. It's worth noting that Gunnison itself sits at 7,700 feet." (https://bikepacking.com/routes/gunni-grinder/)

**Jason Sumner [RECREATIONAL]:** For the 30-mile route: "Top times for the event were around 2.5 hours, but we planned to take things at a more leisurely pace." (https://zenocycleparts.com/blogs/cyclingtips/glorious-gravel-grinding-in-colorado-s-gunnison-county)

## DNF Risk Factors

**plindley [UNKNOWN]:** "Had 4 flats in those miles and didn't want to attempt the rest of it with no more plugs." DNF'd at 30 miles due to flat tires and running out of repair supplies. (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/gunni-grinder-2023-colorado/86583)

**Neil Beltchenko [RECREATIONAL]:** "Altitude, sun exposure, storm potential, and two long days in the saddle will certainly leave you tired at the end of the trip." Lists key challenge factors. (https://bikepacking.com/routes/gunni-grinder/)

**jamesdanielosborne [COMPETITIVE]:** "Relentless climbs (including that big one near the end) and some roads are very rough." The late-race climb appears to be a critical challenge point. (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/gunni-grinder-2023-colorado/86583)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Betsy Welch [COMPETITIVE]:** "During post-race beer commiseration, MTB legend and IMBA president Dave Wiens assured me the answer was A, which made me feel moderately better." Describes supportive post-race atmosphere. (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/the-grind-a-not-quite-farewell-to-gravel/)

**Betsy Welch [COMPETITIVE]:** "The Gunni Grinder has the potential to become a marquee race." Despite being relatively new (debuted 2021), it's gaining recognition. (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/the-grind-a-not-quite-farewell-to-gravel/)

**Betsy Welch [COMPETITIVE]:** "I even won some money!" Indicates prize purse for competitive finishers. (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/the-grind-a-not-quite-farewell-to-gravel/)

**Joel Grimmett (Race Director) [UNKNOWN]:** "We spent all of our vacation time for more than two years riding, driving, studying maps and running into lots of dead-ends and roads that were just a little too challenging for a gravel event... I think the route that we use showcases the area and has a great amount of unpaved surface variety with as little pavement as possible." (https://bikepacking.com/routes/gunni-grinder/)

**Official Info [UNKNOWN]:** "A portion of the race profit helps support Gunnison Trails" — community-focused event. (https://www.thegunnigrinder.com)
