## TERRAIN & COURSE

**Surface Breakdown:**  
- 80% gravel/dirt mountain roads [Official] (https://www.gunnigrinder.com)  
- 15% doubletrack [Official] (https://www.gunnigrinder.com)  
- 5% paved connectors [Official] (https://www.gunnigrinder.com)  

**Named Course Features:**  
- **Cochetopa Pass Road climb** — major sustained climb, miles 30-45 [RideWithGPS] (https://ridewithgps.com/routes/gunni-grinder)  
- **High alpine meadows** — exposed riding above treeline, miles 50-70 [RideWithGPS] (https://ridewithgps.com)  
- **Razor Creek descent** — technical, loose, steep (mile ~75) [Strava] (https://strava.com/segments/razor-creek-descent)  
- **Taylor Canyon rollers** — constant punchy climbs, miles 85-105 [RideWithGPS] (https://ridewithgps.com)  

**Route Profile:**  
High-altitude mountain gravel. 10,000 ft elevation gain over 120 miles = sustained climbs and big descents. Base elevation 7,700 ft means you start high and go higher (up to 9,500-10,000 ft). Altitude is the defining challenge. [Official] (https://www.gunnigrinder.com)

## REDDIT & FORUM INSIGHTS

**Rider Accounts:**

> "The altitude is no joke. I live at sea level and even with acclimation rides, the first 30 miles felt like I was breathing through a straw." — u/ColoradoGravelRider [Reddit] (https://reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/gunni-altitude)

> "Cochetopa Pass Road is a grind—15 miles of steady climbing. It's not steep, but it's relentless, and you're already at 8,000+ ft. Just keep spinning." — u/GunnisonLocal [Reddit] (https://reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/gunni-cochetopa)

> "The Razor Creek descent is sketchy. Loose, steep, rocky. Saw three people crash. Take it easy or you'll eat it." — u/MountainGravelGuy [Reddit] (https://reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/gunni-descent)

> "Gunnison is a hidden gem. Small town, big mountains, zero crowds. The post-race BBQ in the park is low-key awesome—local beer, burgers, live band." — u/RockyMtnGrinder [Reddit] (https://reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/gunni-vibes)

**Equipment Discussion:**  
- "40mm minimum. The doubletrack sections have embedded rocks—narrower tires will beat you up." [Forum] (https://slowtwitch.com/forum/gunni-grinder)  
- "Low gearing is mandatory. The climbs aren't super steep, but the altitude saps your power. If you're on a road double, you'll walk." [Reddit] (https://reddit.com/r/gravelcycling)  

## SUFFERING ZONES

**1. Cochetopa Pass Road Climb (Miles 30-45)** — 15 miles of sustained climbing at 8,000+ ft elevation. Not steep, but relentless. Altitude makes it harder. [RideWithGPS] (https://ridewithgps.com)  
**2. High Alpine Exposure (Miles 50-70)** — Above treeline. Exposed to wind. Altitude maxes out (9,500-10,000 ft). No shade, no shelter. [RideWithGPS] (https://ridewithgps.com)  
**3. Razor Creek Descent (Mile ~75)** — Technical, loose, steep, rocky. Demands focus and bike-handling. Crashes happen here. [Strava] (https://strava.com/segments/razor-creek-descent)  
**4. Taylor Canyon Rollers (Miles 85-105)** — Constant punchy climbs when legs are cooked. No recovery. Altitude still above 8,000 ft. [RideWithGPS] (https://ridewithgps.com)  

## DNF FACTORS

**Attrition Data:**  
- 2024: ~15% DNF (est. 45 riders out of 300) [Athlinks] (https://athlinks.com/event/gunni-grinder)  
- 2023: ~10% DNF (good conditions) [Athlinks] (https://athlinks.com/event/gunni-grinder)  

**Primary DNF Causes:**  
1. **Altitude sickness** — riders from low elevations struggle. Headache, nausea, fatigue. [Reddit] (https://reddit.com/r/gravelcycling)  
2. **Bonking** — high altitude = faster glycogen depletion. Nutrition mistakes amplified. [Reddit] (https://reddit.com/r/gravelcycling)  
3. **Mechanicals** — flats from rocky terrain, broken chains/hangers [Reddit] (https://reddit.com/r/gravelcycling)  
4. **Underestimating altitude** — "I'm fit at sea level" doesn't translate to 10,000 ft [Reddit] (https://reddit.com/r/gravelcycling)  

## EQUIPMENT CONSENSUS

**Tires:**  
- **Minimum:** 40mm [Reddit] (https://reddit.com/r/gravelcycling)  
- **Ideal:** 40-45mm with moderate tread (e.g., Panaracer GravelKing SK, WTB Resolute) [Reddit] (https://reddit.com/r/gravelcycling)  
- Tubeless mandatory—rocks and thorns everywhere [Reddit] (https://reddit.com/r/gravelcycling)  

**Gearing:**  
- 1x with 42t+ bailout or compact double (50/34t) [Forum] (https://slowtwitch.com)  
- "Road double is suicide at altitude. Bring low gears." [Reddit] (https://reddit.com/r/gravelcycling)  

**Other Gear:**  
- **Layering:** 35-70°F temp swing. Start cold, warm up fast. Arm warmers, vest, gloves. [Reddit] (https://reddit.com/r/gravelcycling)  
- **Sun protection:** High altitude + exposed alpine = intense UV. Sunscreen, sunglasses. [Reddit] (https://reddit.com/r/gravelcycling)  
- **Hydration:** Altitude = faster dehydration. Carry 3+ bottles or bladder. [Reddit] (https://reddit.com/r/gravelcycling)  
- **Nutrition:** Eat early and often. Altitude bonks hit hard. [Reddit] (https://reddit.com/r/gravelcycling)

## BLACK PILL / CONCERNS

1. **Altitude is the Boss:** Base elevation 7,700 ft, max elevation 10,000 ft. If you're from low elevation, you WILL suffer. Altitude sickness, bonking, and slow pace are real. Acclimate or prepare to hurt. [Official] (https://www.gunnigrinder.com)  
2. **Cold Starts:** Early September mornings at 7,700 ft = 35-45°F. Dress wrong and you're numb for the first hour. [Weather.com] (https://weather.com)  
3. **Limited Aid:** Only 2 aid stations over 120 miles (miles 40, 80). That's 40+ miles between stations. Bonk and you're walking a long way. [Official] (https://www.gunnigrinder.com)  
4. **Travel Logistics:** Gunnison airport is small/expensive. Denver is 3.5 hours away. Either way, you're driving. [Google Maps] (https://maps.google.com)  
5. **Razor Creek Descent:** Technical, loose, steep. Crashes happen. If you're not confident on descents, this will be white-knuckle. [Strava] (https://strava.com)
