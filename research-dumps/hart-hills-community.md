# HART HILLS — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Christina Vipond [ELITE]:** "Three hours and 39 minutes of hills, wind and sand! Hart Hills The Classic Gravel Road Race 2021 was the most challenging course I have raced yet. It was also the course that made me laugh the most... I crested a hill and saw a big pothole, there was no choice but to stay to the left just as the race director had announced. The wind was still gusting when I hit some rollers and barely felt like I was moving going downhill. I was pretty sure I was going to get blown back up."

**Christina Vipond [ELITE]:** "I rounded a corner on the seasonal road and, of course there it was [the long steep climb], not on a gravel road. I had only 10 miles left and I knew the last few were pavement and downhill. I was excited to hit pavement with about 8 miles remaining. But there was that gusty crosswind and an open farm field, which put me in a complete dust out for a few seconds." (https://www.athleticmentors.com/hart-hills-gravel-grinder/)

**Tracy Gravlin [RECREATIONAL]:** "It was pretty much loose stones and sand. But thankfully also pavement! ... The first big gravel/sand hill, some around me got off to walk. But I felt good and made it up no problem... About 43 minutes in, we hit a 2 track that was very deep sand and no way to get off to the side to ride. My confidence ended there, and I got off and ran my bike. A steep downhill in beach sand followed, and I ran that too (I am a 69 year old woman with osteoporosis. I do not need to crash)."

**Tracy Gravlin [RECREATIONAL]:** "I must say I was happy I signed up for the 26 mile race and not the 55. Phew... I ended 1st age group out of 3, 60-69. And 9th out of 26 women. It was definitely a challenge for me, and I am happy with my riding in the sand and putting to use what i have learned in BaseCamp. I tried to gear 2 breathe on hills." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/tracys-story-hart-hills)

**Race Director Raymond Passchier [RACE ORGANIZER]:** Pre-race announcement: "the rain did not help the road conditions as they had hoped for. He was also announcing sand at mile 23, a large pothole at mile 32 so stay to the left, and a couple of well marked areas of 'rough road'." (https://www.athleticmentors.com/hart-hills-gravel-grinder/)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Tracy Gravlin [RECREATIONAL]:** "I heard it was sandy and checked with a few people who had done it before. They didn't remember it being bad. So I took my Lauf with 40c tires instead of my wider Gravel Kings. We drove the course the night before, and I cursed myself for not bringing the 50c tires. It was pretty much loose stones and sand." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/tracys-story-hart-hills)

**RECREATIONAL RIDER RECOMMENDATION:** After pre-riding, Tracy regretted not bringing 50c tires instead of 40c for the loose sand and stones. Wider is better for this course's conditions.

**Christina Vipond [ELITE]:** Successfully used the "lick em and stick em" trick for Clif energy cubes on the top tube: "two rows of cubes on the tube, ready to give a burst of energy. I quickly learned two rows is not a good idea, a couple fell off in the first few miles but overall the trick was working, at least for the first hour. By the second hour of the race, the remaining cubes were coated with dust." (https://www.athleticmentors.com/hart-hills-gravel-grinder/)

**ELITE NUTRITION NOTE:** One row of sticky cubes may be better than two for dusty conditions. By hour two, dust coating made them less appealing.

## Weather Experienced

**2021 Race (Christina Vipond):** "I did a pre race ride the day before from my home and noted how hard the wind was blowing. The weather report indicated there would continue to be 10 mph winds with gusts the next day... the temperature warmed up enough to be comfortable. Then the fun really started. It only took a couple more turns and we were riding into a strong head wind... the wind continued with strong gusts... The wind was still gusting... there was that gusty crosswind and an open farm field, which put me in a complete dust out for a few seconds." (https://www.athleticmentors.com/hart-hills-gravel-grinder/)

**2025 Race (Tracy Gravlin):** "It was a beautiful day. Just the right temp. The wind was only noticeable in the last 1/2 of the race." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/tracys-story-hart-hills)

**2025 Race (from YouTube description):** "Start temp was 55 and foggy but during the race the sun came out" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MSTdq4g_hI)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Course Profile [ELITE rider observation]:** "I did look at the profile on Strava so I knew there was 3000 feet of climbing that included a long, steep climb about 40 miles into the 55 mile race." (https://www.athleticmentors.com/hart-hills-gravel-grinder/)

**Sand Sections:** Multiple riders confirm extensive sand. Christina Vipond [ELITE]: "Another turn onto a seasonal road and the thought of 'hang on, there is some sand'. I managed that area of sand and was thinking back to the pre-race course announcements, I wasn't even close to mile 23 yet. Another turn and more sand, and wind, and climbing... The sand continued to be constant as well." (https://www.athleticmentors.com/hart-hills-gravel-grinder/)

**Deep Sand Two-Track:** Tracy Gravlin [RECREATIONAL]: "About 43 minutes in, we hit a 2 track that was very deep sand and no way to get off to the side to ride... A steep downhill in beach sand followed" (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/tracys-story-hart-hills)

**Washed-Out Turn:** Christina Vipond [ELITE]: "Then I saw the sign for a sharp right turn. As I got closer, I saw it wasn't just a sharp turn, but a downhill turn onto a washed out, sandy two-track. I started laughing and asked the volunteer 'seriously?' He had a funny smile and shrugged his shoulders." (https://www.athleticmentors.com/hart-hills-gravel-grinder/)

**Seasonal Roads:** Multiple references to "seasonal roads" that were sandier and rougher than standard gravel roads.

**Finish:** Christina Vipond [ELITE]: "I rode the finish of the course, which was pavement with some small rollers and downhill to the finish line, much better than a climb at the end." Last 8 miles include pavement. (https://www.athleticmentors.com/hart-hills-gravel-grinder/)

**Named Segments:** Course includes segments called "Hart Breaker Hill," "Stan's Stomping Grounds," and "Remember Kelly" (https://www.harthills.com/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Christina Vipond [ELITE] - 55 mile in 3:39:** "The 55 mile racers lined up for a mass start at 10 am... It only took a couple more turns and we were riding into a strong head wind. No problem, just stay on a wheel, there can't be a headwind the entire ride... I was riding a section of gravel road which was pretty much loose sand when I saw a man getting his mail from his mailbox. He looked at me and smiled. I told him I didn't know I was going to have so much fun riding today. He responded with, 'You are a long way from Hart'." (https://www.athleticmentors.com/hart-hills-gravel-grinder/)

**ELITE PACING NOTE:** Christina worked with two male riders, trading pulls - "They would be a bit ahead of me on the climbs, and I would take off on them in the downhills." After losing them at the deep sand section around mile ~16 (43 minutes in), she "used surges to get past people and eventually reeling all but the 2 guys in... Caught up to them and passed them with 4 miles to go." (https://www.athleticmentors.com/hart-hills-gravel-grinder/)

**Tracy Gravlin [RECREATIONAL] - 26 mile race:** "As usual I found myself way too far back at the start. I had to start a little slower going out of town. Once we got to our first big climb, on pavement, I tried to pass as many as I could... I am very happy that I started to feel comfortable riding on the sandy roads." She focused on "my pedaling and hydrated well." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/tracys-story-hart-hills)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Sandy Descents:** Christina Vipond [ELITE]: "Another turn and more sand... a downhill turn onto a washed out, sandy two-track... another sandy two-track that I was not able to navigate cleanly and had to get off the bike." Even elite riders had to dismount in sections. (https://www.athleticmentors.com/hart-hills-gravel-grinder/)

**Crashes in Deep Sand:** Tracy Gravlin [RECREATIONAL]: "A steep downhill in beach sand followed, and I ran that too (I am a 69 year old woman with osteoporosis. I do not need to crash). Sadly I was passed by so many riders. Some wiped out." Multiple crashes observed in the deep sand descent. (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/tracys-story-hart-hills)

**Crosswind Hazard:** Christina Vipond [ELITE]: "one more gust of wind made me stop riding completely because it was pushing me into the lane of an oncoming truck, Mother Nature exerting herself one last time." Wind gusts strong enough to push riders into traffic lanes. (https://www.athleticmentors.com/hart-hills-gravel-grinder/)
