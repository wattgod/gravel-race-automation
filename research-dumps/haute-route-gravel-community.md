# HAUTE ROUTE GRAVEL — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Maxime Cauchois [COMPETITIVE]:** "Looking back, I think my weekly blocks could have been structured differently. Maybe a 3-day hard sessions block approach would better simulate the strain of multiple consecutive days: for example, VO2 on Tuesday, Sweetspot on Wednesday, and Threshold on Thursday." Regarding his preparation for Haute Route Alps 2022, where he finished 55/302. (https://www.altovelo.org/blog/race-report-2022-haute-route-alps)

**Maxime Cauchois [COMPETITIVE]:** "After 30min of climbing, despite eating and drinking regularly, my legs kept feeling weaker and weaker, and my bike computer was showing lower and lower numbers, decreasing by about 10-20W every 10 min... In hindsight, I made a rookie mistake by not refilling at the bottom and trying to reach the top with a single full bottle only to save a few hundred grams." On the Col de la Lombarde during Haute Route Alps. (https://www.altovelo.org/blog/race-report-2022-haute-route-alps)

**Frank Persyn [ELITE]:** "Two days prior to the start, I had a bad day on the bike when I rode with my neighbour and sports buddy Graham Friend... He told me what exactly went wrong with me that day. My carb intake was far too low which made me slow as a snail and running out of energy." Pre-race experience before Haute Route Alps 2019. (https://www.kudoscycling.com/the-kudos-blog/racereport-hauteroutealps)

**Rupert Guinness [ELITE]:** "I stopped at the drinks stations instead of pushing through. I chatted to fellow riders from all over the globe. I loved breathing the fresh, mountain air. I marvelled at the scenery. I tapped up the climbs and luxuriated in the long, sweeping descents... It was a week in which I was constantly reminded why I love riding my bike so much." On his approach to Haute Route Alps after deciding not to race it competitively. (https://velo.outsideonline.com/road/road-culture/rupert-guinness-finding-my-own-race-at-haute-route/)

**Mark Gilmour [UNKNOWN]:** "On stage 1 I cramped up on the climb to Col de Cayolle, as we climbed 32km from Ascros to the first big summit. At this point I was concerned that I wouldn't be able to make the time cuts and finish the race... I realised that I wasn't replenishing the salts I was losing through sweating and the effort and so made some changes to my refueling strategy that involved more crackers and included a bit more salt in my food. It made a difference, no more cramps." (https://markgilmour.wordpress.com/2017/09/19/my-haute-route-experience/)

**Anonymous rider [UNKNOWN] on TrainerRoad forums:** "I noticed not all of them [top finishers] were doing massive volume this year. Some were on mostly 10 to 12 hour weeks, but had done that for over 10 years. Consistency is key." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/5-weeks-to-haute-route-alps-best-use-of-time/94789?page=5)

**llomqm [UNKNOWN] on TrainerRoad forums:** "I feel like I'm squeezing most of the juice out of the ~10 weekly hours I have to train. Devoting more time here may lead to a better GC result, but I honestly think I'd enjoy this hobby less. I definitely don't need to be training like this just to enjoy the non-striving Haute Route experience." After completing Haute Route Alps 2024. (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/5-weeks-to-haute-route-alps-best-use-of-time/94789?page=5)

**juanandresso [UNKNOWN] on TrainerRoad forums:** "By the second or third day of the event, my legs were completely cooked. The delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) was intense and felt way beyond what I'd normally experience... I finally understood when pros talk about 'hoping for good legs' rather than focusing on heart or lungs; the legs became the clear limiting factor!" Despite having FTP of 4.3 w/kg and following structured training. (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/5-weeks-to-haute-route-alps-best-use-of-time/94789?page=5)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Maxime Cauchois [COMPETITIVE]:** Started each stage with "two 550 ml bottles of a mix of 20g Skratch hydration /30g Highly Branched Cyclic Dextrin in each, similar to Skratch superfuel mix (=50g of carbs)." When bottles were empty, refilled with water + grenadine. Used Skratch bars, energy chews, gels and shot blocks on the bike, ordered from Gelvio prior to the event. (https://www.altovelo.org/blog/race-report-2022-haute-route-alps)

**Bike shop mechanic in Boulder [source: COMPETITIVE rider]:** "No, sir, we cannot put a smaller chain-ring or a bigger cassette on your bike. You already have the lowest ratio possible. Welcome to the Rockies." To a rider preparing for Haute Route Rockies 2017, indicating importance of gearing choice. (https://southperthrouleurs.com.au/2017/07/07/haute-route-rockies-2017-ride-report/comment-page-1/)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Maxime Cauchois [COMPETITIVE]:** "Col d'Agnel on the Italian side is a tale of two climbs: the first one, that averages about 5% over about 11km, is manageable and felt very bearable, as the altitude hadn't kicked in yet and the slope was anything but unfriendly... [then] 9km at 10% average, with ramps up to 14%, topping at a very respectable 2744 m, making it the second highest Pass in Italy (after the Stelvio)." (https://www.altovelo.org/blog/race-report-2022-haute-route-alps)

**Rupert Guinness [ELITE]:** "Haute Route Alps was also a ride 'back in time.' The mountains ridden are steeped in cycling history... The passes we tackled read like a brutal week at the Tour de France: Col de la Lombarde (20.6km long at a 7% average gradient to 2,350m altitude), Col d'Izoard (14.2km at 7% to 2,360m), Col d'Agnello (20.6km at 7% to 2,744m), Col du Lauteret (26.7km at 3.1% to 2,058m), Col de Sarenne (13.2km at 7.1% to 1,999m), Col du Glandon (25.2km at 4.5% to 1,924m), Col de la Madeleine (19.1km at 8% to 2,000m), Col de la Loze (10.1km at 8.6% to 2,305m) and Cormet de Rosele nd (19.2km at 6.1% to1,968m)." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/road/road-culture/rupert-guinness-finding-my-own-race-at-haute-route/)

**Mark Gilmour [UNKNOWN]:** "On the Col d'Granon a dead-end climb of 12km to a gravel car park... It was a tough climb which tested my mental capacity as I had to dig deep to finish ahead of the cut... I can with complete confidence say that I have no desire to ever go back to the top of the Col d'Granon, the road that leads nowhere." (https://markgilmour.wordpress.com/2017/09/19/my-haute-route-experience/)

**Rupert Guinness [ELITE]:** "The descent of the Col de la Lombarde on the Italian side is one of the most spectacular roads I ever cycled on, but its technicality also requires constant attention." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/road/road-culture/rupert-guinness-finding-my-own-race-at-haute-route/)

**Gravel Epic Switzerland course description [from promotional material]:** "The two-day course rides and races across the Alps and valleys on gravel tracks, forest and small farm roads. Based at stunning Champex-Lac... Only timed climbs count towards the competition, so you can race against your friends and other competitors if you want too, but it also gives you the chance to relax at the feed stations and meet and ride with other people on route." (https://www.granfondoguide.com/Contents/Index/6209/register-now-for-gravel-epic-switzerland)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Maxime Cauchois [COMPETITIVE]:** "I was purposely saving energy for the second part [of Col d'Agnel], which alone makes the Col d'Agnel one of the most difficult ascents in the Alps... I settled into a mid-tempo (=230W/3.6W/kg) pace, which was slower than the first one, but made sense given the length of the effort and the fatigue that my legs had accumulated—we had ridden for 4h already." (https://www.altovelo.org/blog/race-report-2022-haute-route-alps)

**Frank Persyn [ELITE]:** "At least 2 gels per hour during every ride, feeding myself within 20 mins after the finish followed by a proper massage. This information was invaluable, as I needed to divide my energy and power consistently over 7 days of riding." Advice from elite athlete Graham Friend. (https://www.kudoscycling.com/the-kudos-blog/racereport-hauteroutealps)

**Rupert Guinness [ELITE]:** "As each climb passed under our wheels, the process of breaking the stage down mountain-by-mountain helped to ease any anxiety... each mountain would take 90 minutes to two hours to climb; while descending them would take approximately an hour." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/road/road-culture/rupert-guinness-finding-my-own-race-at-haute-route/)

**Maxime Cauchois [COMPETITIVE]:** "I tried to constantly monitor my energy levels, and to make sure I was never hungry or thirsty, but I'm not sure exactly how much I ate—if asked, I would answer: a whole lot. Interestingly, while most Bay Area climbs don't require you to eat or drink during the effort itself, I found it much more imperative to do so on a 90 min HC climb, especially when there are several in a row." (https://www.altovelo.org/blog/race-report-2022-haute-route-alps)

**juanandresso [UNKNOWN]:** "This time around, I'm also planning to focus more on gym work, especially targeting glutes, which fatigued by day 2. Clearly, my DOMS weren't in line with what I'd trained for, and stronger glutes might help with that fatigue." After experiencing severe leg fatigue despite 4.3 w/kg FTP. (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/5-weeks-to-haute-route-alps-best-use-of-time/94789?page=5)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Mark Gilmour [UNKNOWN]:** "My goal of the week was to make the time cut each day and not receive the dreaded DNF (did not finish)... For each stage there was an official cut off by which we as riders must finish in order to be categorised and receive an official finish time." (https://markgilmour.wordpress.com/2017/09/19/my-haute-route-experience/)

**Maxime Cauchois [COMPETITIVE]:** "Arriving at the start of the timed section, I was only riding with a friend from Quebec I had made along the way, so we decided to wait a couple minutes for a group to join us... A few moments later, we saw a team of 4 Russian riders flying by, and had to sprint our way into their draft (doing more than 450W for 30s with cramping legs, not recommended)." Missing a group on flat sections can cost significant time and energy. (https://www.altovelo.org/blog/race-report-2022-haute-route-alps)

**Maxime Cauchois [COMPETITIVE]:** "After what seemed like an eternity, I finally noticed the summit sign a few hundred meters away, and the thought of foods and drinking awaiting at the top fueled the last pedal strokes... I was close to collapsing at the top, but I made my way to all the food and drinks I could find, focusing especially on hydration. I spent a good 20 min at the top, and I wish I had stayed there even longer to recover." Inadequate recovery at feed stations can compound problems. (https://www.altovelo.org/blog/race-report-2022-haute-route-alps)

**juanandresso [UNKNOWN]:** "By the second or third day of the event, my legs were completely cooked. The delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) was intense... from day two I had to settle for a mediocre pace with heart rate at 75% with no legs to push harder." Despite solid training and 4.3 w/kg FTP. (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/5-weeks-to-haute-route-alps-best-use-of-time/94789?page=5)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Rupert Guinness [ELITE]:** "Haute Route Alps also led to the creation of new friendships with fellow riders from around the world, friendships forged by a shared suffering and encouragement throughout the week. It amazed me to see so many nationalities and hear so many languages with riders from all over Britain and Europe, the Americas, Asia, Africa and Australia and New Zealand." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/road/road-culture/rupert-guinness-finding-my-own-race-at-haute-route/)

**Frank Persyn [ELITE]:** "A huge shout out and thank you to the all of the riders, support crews, Police, mechanics, volunteers that made the week happen but especially to Joe, Manuel, Monika, Lukas, Joe, Greg, Sean, Gernot, Ian, Chris and Scott who rode at various times with me and made the days fantastic." (https://www.kudoscycling.com/the-kudos-blog/racereport-hauteroutealps)

**Rupert Guinness [ELITE]:** "Arriving for the start of each day's stage... it was easy to let the mind escape and imagine being in a grand tour with the sight of official vehicles parked in formation ahead of the start line. It felt the same as each stage got underway with a rolling road closure controlled by race marshals on motor bikes in a flotilla of official vehicles that included organisation, media and medical cars, a broom wagon for riders outside the daily time limits, and through crowds of locals or holidaymakers cheering as riders passed." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/road/road-culture/rupert-guinness-finding-my-own-race-at-haute-route/)

**Rupert Guinness [ELITE]:** "Shortly before the start of stage two... 'You are only a place or two ahead of me,' quipped a rider behind me in a slow, deep and heavy Dutch accent... It was shortly before the start of stage two of the Haute Route Alps... My approach to the event changed. For that night, following that second stage, there I was at the dinner table, checking the general classification... After taking Manfred's bait hook, line and sinker, the next five days became 'our' race with the race, with a third rider of similar age, shape and condition, Claude Autry from Mauritius joining in." Even riders not competing for overall victory created their own internal competitions. (https://velo.outsideonline.com/road/road-culture/rupert-guinness-finding-my-own-race-at-haute-route/)

**sasa [UNKNOWN] on TrainerRoad forums:** Regarding Alp Cycles tour package support: "Our setup had a tent so we can get out of the sun, chairs to sit and relax, and food/drinks. For refreshments, they had chips, sandwiches, bananas, tomatoes, water, coke, orangina, and general bike nutrition... We had a dedicated tent at all finish lines... Same as official stops - dedicated tent, chairs, snacks, drinks, etc. But also an espresso machine, and beer/champagne in Nice!" (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/5-weeks-to-haute-route-alps-best-use-of-time/94789?page=5)

**sasa [UNKNOWN]:** "I would give them [Alp Cycles] a solid 4.5/5.0... our group of riders (19 total) was excellent, with no exceptions! I would say at least half of the group has used Alp Cycles at least once, with several using them for 5-10+ tours." Regarding tour operator experience. (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/5-weeks-to-haute-route-alps-best-use-of-time/94789?page=5)

## Organizational Details

**Julie Royer, Haute Route CEO:** "Over the past 10 years, the Haute Route has become a 'bucket list' and an inspiration for riders across the globe... We are thrilled to be integrating into The IRONMAN Group and continuing to inspire generations of amateur athletes." Following acquisition by IRONMAN Group in August 2021. (https://www.racedirectorshq.com/read/ironman-group-acquires-haute-route-gravel-epic-300/)

**Official description:** "Since its beginning in 2011, the single event has expanded to a series of races across the world designed to give riders a challenging, immersive, and premium experience through the world's most iconic cycling destinations.

**Gravel Epic description:** "The Gravel Epic is a new multi-day gravel racing series set in premier destinations like the Atlas Mountains, Swiss Alps and other incredible gravel destinations. Created in 2019, Gravel Epic was acquired by Haute Route earlier in 2021 and currently has events scheduled for Switzerland and Morocco with plans to expand and meet the growing demand of cyclists globally." (https://www.racedirectorshq.com/read/ironman-group-acquires-haute-route-gravel-epic-300/)

**sasa [UNKNOWN]:** "I've spoken with a few people who've done the official HR package (no tour guide), and the consensus was that hotels were acceptable, but barely, while food was generally sub-par. Some were a bit more vocal than that, wondering what they actually paid for, but everyone's different. If you have the money, go for a reputable tour company." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/5-weeks-to-haute-route-alps-best-use-of-time/94789?page=5)
