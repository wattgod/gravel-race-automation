# HEATHLAND GRAVEL — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Event Overview & Unique Features

Heathland Gravel is the **only European qualifier for Unbound Gravel**, organized by Flanders Classics in Maasmechelen, Belgium. The event takes place in Terhills Nature Park in the shadow of the Maasmechelen mine shaft, a location that has also hosted UCI Cyclo-Cross World Cup rounds.

**Key differentiator:** Over 85% of the 160km course is on unpaved roads, making it "a true gravel race" rather than a mixed-surface event. Of the 160km, more than 130km are timed across different segments. (https://www.granfondoguide.com/Contents/IndexFull/8239/heathland-gravel-is-back-in-2025)

**Unbound Qualification System:** 50 spots total for Unbound Gravel are available:
- 25 spots awarded based on performance within age categories (each age category guaranteed at least one spot)
- 25 spots distributed randomly via lottery among all 160km finishers
- Spots can roll down if declined by winners

The event is described by Flanders Classics CEO Tomas Van Den Spiegel as: "UNBOUND Gravel is to gravellers what Kona in Hawaii is for triathletes: a monumental sporting goal and exceptional experience."

**[RECREATIONAL]:** One first-time racer noted: "This was my first gravel race. And I never experienced a bike race before. Technically this wasn't a race, because I did the 70 km route. The 160 km distance was the real race." (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Xg7YkvYdU)

What's included in ticket: Two well-stocked feed stations, exposure to local culture along the way, social rides, bike expo access, and various entertainment activities. (https://www.heathlandgravel.com/en)

## Community Perspective & Controversy

**[UNKNOWN]:** Guitar Ted Productions blogger noted: "This is veering from the original intentions of not only gravel events at the grassroots level, (which arguably happened with Unbound years ago), but it is also not in the vein of gravel events as a whole. Some may see this as an elevation of the Unbound events, but others, who may already be decrying Unbound as a sell-out and worse, will no doubt find this news even more damning for the popular gravel event in Emporia."

The same source questioned: "Do the qualifying people take away from the roster limitations, and if this idea is expanded to other venues worldwide, does Life Time move away from the lottery to a full-on event qualified field for Unbound? This is how it works for Kona, a Life Time triathlon event... Will this eventually be the case for gravel riders in the future? Heathland Gravel may just be the start of a sea change for Unbound Gravel." (https://g-tedproductions.blogspot.com/2024/02/gravel-grinder-news-heathland-gravel-to.html)

Flanders Classics has stated: "In the future, the intention is to expand the number of official qualifiers for Unbound Gravel internationally." (https://g-tedproductions.blogspot.com/2024/02/gravel-grinder-news-heathland-gravel-to.html)

Life Time's President of Events, Kimo Seymour, stated their goal: "We are excited to grow the reach and appeal of Unbound Gravel to Europe." (https://g-tedproductions.blogspot.com/2024/02/gravel-grinder-news-heathland-gravel-to.html)
