## 2. RACE HISTORY & FOUNDING

### Origins
- **Founded**: 2009 by Jeremy Kershaw
- **First Race**: Only 40 bikes on the starting line in 2009
- **Inspiration**: Kershaw was inspired after competing in Ragnarok (Red Wing) and Almanzo (Northfield) races - the events that kicked off endurance gravel cycling in Minnesota
- **Name Origin**: "Heck of the North" is a tongue-in-cheek reference to Paris-Roubaix, the legendary cobbled classic nicknamed "Hell of the North"

### Founder Background - Jeremy Kershaw
- Registered nurse from Duluth
- Lived in Minnesota since 1997
- Spent 7 years guiding sled dogs at Wintergreen and co-managing outfitting at Piragis Northwoods in Ely, MN
- First 20 years of his life spent in Nebraska
- Ultra-endurance credentials: Multiple Arrowhead 135 finishes, Trans Wisconsin, Trans Iowa, Tour Divide finish in 2017 (2,740 miles in 22 days)
- Co-organizes events with partner Avesa Rockwell

### Vision & Philosophy
Kershaw wanted to offer something the southern Minnesota gravel races did not have:
- **Remoteness** - True backcountry feel
- **No corn stubble** - Forested roads instead of open farmland
- **Funky vibe** - Inclusive atmosphere for all rider types
- **Self-reliance ethos** - "You are on your own and responsible for getting home by only your own hard work"

### Growth Timeline
- 2009: First race with 40 riders
- Early years: Quickly grew to have a waiting list
- Mid-2010s: Added shorter distances (20 and 55 miles) to welcome more riders
- Present: 250+ participant field, part of a three-race series

## 6. BLACK PILL - Honest Truths

### The Difficult Reality
1. **It's called "Heck" for a reason** - This is intentionally brutal. Expect to walk sections. You might wish you had a mountain bike.

2. **Briton Pit Road will sort you out** - The first 5 miles are rough two-track. If you're not ready for this, the race will humble you immediately.

3. **No hand-holding** - Self-supported ethos means no sag wagons, no signs guiding you home. You navigate by cue cards. Get lost? Your problem.

4. **Weather roulette** - Early October in Northern Minnesota can be anything: 50F and sunny, 35F and sleeting, or the first snow of the year. Prepare for the worst.

5. **Limited support** - One aid station per distance. That's it. Water, Gatorade, PB&J, bananas, gummy bears. Bring everything else you need.

6. **Registration fills** - The race has sold out. Transfers are allowed but you're at the mercy of finding someone willing to give up their spot.

7. **No refunds, no deferrals** - Pay your money, show up or lose it. No transfers to next year.

8. **Remote = isolated** - The "sense of remoteness" is real. Mechanical failure in the backcountry means a long walk or wait.

9. **The course is secret** - You don't get the route until Friday night. No pre-riding, no course familiarity unless you know the area.

10. **All sections get the rough stuff** - Even the 19-mile "intro" course includes the brutal Alger Grade Forest finish. There is no easy option.

### Who This Race Is NOT For
- Beginners who have never ridden gravel
- Riders uncomfortable with navigation by cue sheet
- Anyone expecting course support or spectators
- Those who need to pre-ride courses for confidence
- Riders without proper cold/wet weather gear

### Who This Race IS For
- Self-reliant gravel veterans seeking adventure
- Riders who embrace Type 2 fun
- Those seeking a "different" gravel experience away from corn country
- Cyclists who value the journey over the competition
