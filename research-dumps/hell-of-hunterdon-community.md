# HELL OF HUNTERDON — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Bruno De Geest [UNKNOWN]:** "As one of the Belgian riders I really enjoyed participating in the Hell of Hunterdon. It was and epic ride that, due to the cold and rainy weather conditions, truly evoked the spirit of the Flanders' Classic. It was a pleasure as well as an honor to participate in this ride, the day before our idol Tom Boonen won the Ronde van Vlaanderen." (https://www.hellofhunterdon.com/)

**John Richter [UNKNOWN]:** "I really enjoyed the HoH event. You guys did a fantastic job! Odd as it might sound, I especially liked the markings on the course. Unlike so many other events, where the markings are on the roadway, the HoH yellow markers were easy to see and follow even without a cue sheet. I wish every event was marked in similar fashion and run as well as HoH. Finally, what a lovely course! The combination of gravel and road riding was both challenging and quite beautiful! This was one of the best events I've ever participated in and I already look forward to next year!" (https://www.hellofhunterdon.com/)

**Matt Butterman [COMPETITIVE]:** "This event has a memorable quality and lasting appeal, even though the conditions were extreme, it is part of the challenge of the event, and when finished, all I can think about is coming back next year." (https://www.cxmagazine.com/offseason-fundo-hell-hunterdon-sees-success)

**Kris Broekart [COMPETITIVE]:** "This is the one weekend each year I get homesick" [referring to the fact that the Ronde is a defacto national holiday in Flanders] "but riding the Hell of Hunterdon gives me a little taste of home". (https://www.cxmagazine.com/offseason-fundo-hell-hunterdon-sees-success)

**A rider from Boston [COMPETITIVE]:** Reported "the dirt and gravel roads were as expected, but that the paved sections were 'undersold', referring to a horrible stretch of chip sealed road not included in the tally of dirt roads." (https://www.cxmagazine.com/offseason-fundo-hell-hunterdon-sees-success)

**urbantriathlete [ELITE]:** "It was an awesome day on the bike. Definitely didn't feel like a race, was just a really fun bike ride, with some big hills and lots of gravel - sketchy gravel. I rode with a bunch of guys from my LBS and made friends with lots of random people. It was a great day." (https://forum.slowtwitch.com/t/hell-of-hunterdon-whos-racing/619169)

**tucktri [ELITE]:** "2014 will be my fourth year doing this ride. I have zero interest in racing it. It's a great day. Some good climbing, lots of gravel sections with some white knuckle descents. Totally feasible for non racing folks. Of course you want to have a good ride and it's somewhat no different to an ironman. Pace it accordingly. Most shoot out at the gun too hard and you spend the rest of the day passing people as they have blown up. I can count on my hands the number of people who have passed me after the first rest stop, about mile 36?" (https://forum.slowtwitch.com/t/hell-of-hunterdon-whos-racing/619169)

**AnthonyC [UNKNOWN]:** "The gravel roads were pretty bad last year; I'm sure they'll be pretty bad this year too. Lots of guys flatted, a few lost control on descents, especially early in the day before the pack strung out. Its worth being careful and leaving a lot of space, especially with such a huge mix of conditioning and bike handling on display." (https://www.mtbnj.com/forum/threads/hell-of-hunterdon.20590/page-2)

**Claude [UNKNOWN]:** Reported 76 miles and 4750' of elevation from their Garmin file. "Some sections had very loose gravel on downhills - more sketchy than the 'typical' stuff around Larger Cross road, for example." (https://www.mtbnj.com/forum/threads/hell-of-hunterdon.20590/page-2)

**dsmallwood [UNKNOWN]:** "well, it was three years in the making but i finally got this one done. wow, what a cool event. and what a beating. i expected the gravel pits, i did not expect the severity of the hills. that was nuts." (https://forum.slowtwitch.com/t/hell-of-hunterdon-whos-racing/619169)

**Matthew Vandivort [COMPETITIVE]:** "The mood on the start line was positive and welcoming as we waited for our start. Sure the weather didn't hurt, but the mood on the start line was positive and welcoming... the vibe was without a doubt friendlier than most USAC races I have been to in recent years - there was no built-in hierarchy based on USAC category or team association - it was just 800 odd riders getting together for a day on the bike and some post-ride beers."

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**urbantriathlete [ELITE]:** "I rode 25mms Vittoria rubino corsa pros and was fine. You want a durable tire but don't necessarily need gatorskins." (https://forum.slowtwitch.com/t/hell-of-hunterdon-whos-racing/619169)

**tucktri [ELITE]:** "No need for any of the above [knobby tires, cross-bike, gatorskins]. Have even seen guys on MTBs. One of my friends does ride his cross bike every year with knobby tires because he can. Always funny when he goes by the roadies on it. I just use a decent training tire from Specialized and have had no issues." (https://forum.slowtwitch.com/t/hell-of-hunterdon-whos-racing/619169)

**AnthonyC [UNKNOWN]:** "I rode on a set of 700x23c's with no trouble, but I'm convinced that I just got lucky. That said, there's no need for knobbies or MTBs; you'll do just fine on gravel with road slicks. Lots of folks on everything from high zoot carbon race bikes to old school touring frames; I was on an aluminum race frame, which probably wasn't the most comfortable rig, but totally doable." (https://www.mtbnj.com/forum/threads/hell-of-hunterdon.20590/page-2)

**Claude [UNKNOWN]:** "I had 23mm tubeless (Fusion - which are more like 21 than 23) and no problems. Heard that locals run tubes injected with Stan's." (https://www.mtbnj.com/forum/threads/hell-of-hunterdon.20590/page-2)

**From official site:** "Cyclocross bikes are welcome, but certainly not required, as most of the ride is on paved roads." (https://www.hellofhunterdon.com/)

**Matthew Vandivort [COMPETITIVE]:** Documented equipment diversity: "Equipment choices ranged from the usual assortment of 'adventure' bikes to a few mountain bikes and more unique choices: like this rider in jeans that passed us mid-ride on a beautiful vintage steel bike with downtube shifters and toe clips." (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/2019/3/hell-of-hunterdon-and-a-better-form-of-bikes)

## Weather Experienced

**2012 Edition [COMPETITIVE sources]:** "43 and rainy for the day, making both riders and ride staff shudder at the thought of slogging 79 miles on dirt, gravel, and pavement in near-hypothermia conditions... Some riders were dressed for sub-zero weather, though some were ready to tackle the elements with only a thin layer of embrocation and their summer kit with arm warmers." (https://www.cxmagazine.com/offseason-fundo-hell-hunterdon-sees-success)

**2014 Edition [ELITE source]:** "Well except for the damn wind." (https://forum.slowtwitch.com/t/hell-of-hunterdon-whos-racing/619169)

**2019 Edition [COMPETITIVE source]:** "According to Jed Kornbluh, one of the race organizers, it was the best weather they have had in 11 editions of the event." The race report describes it as "65 and sunny, not quite 'classics' weather." (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/2019/3/hell-of-hunterdon-and-a-better-form-of-bikes)

**tucktri [ELITE]:** "One word of advice, don't get too drunk the night before. Have made this mistake last two years. Ugh... It can start cold then get warmer. Or it can rain all day. Or it can be cold all day. I have had all three." (https://forum.slowtwitch.com/t/hell-of-hunterdon-whos-racing/619169)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Specific road sections mentioned [COMPETITIVE source]:** "Of course many riders testify that the hardest part of the parcours isn't poorly surfaced at all; Pine Hill Road is a unrelenting paved road with gradients up to 20 percent, before it turns to dirt." (https://www.cxmagazine.com/offseason-fundo-hell-hunterdon-sees-success)

**Brian Ignatin (promoter) [COMPETITIVE source]:** Joked "when resurfacing Harbourton-Woodsville Rd., the township ran out of gravel, so they resorted to a random placement of what they had left", referring to a three mile poorly paved section. (https://www.cxmagazine.com/offseason-fundo-hell-hunterdon-sees-success)

**Brian Palmer [COMPETITIVE source]:** Coined the term "gravé" to describe what Hunterdon County has - "these are not smooth red loam roads, but are more often washboard sections of hardscrabble, gravel, and unsealed hard pack." (https://www.cxmagazine.com/offseason-fundo-hell-hunterdon-sees-success)

**ArmyOfNone [UNKNOWN]:** "I personally would stay off the dirt roads for a bit. I have been on dutchtown-zion, montgomery rd and rocktown and have ridden by barry and wilson rd. The roads are covered in compacted snow making traction very unpredictable. Its so going. I was preparing myself to go down at any moment." [Pre-event winter training caution] (https://www.mtbnj.com/forum/threads/hell-of-hunterdon.20590/page-2)

**AnthonyC [UNKNOWN]:** "The ride tends to separate pretty quickly into those who plan on treating it like a ride and those who plan on treating it like a race... Last year, they staggered the start into 'fast', 'medium', and 'slow' paces -- and, surprise, surprise, about 90% of the starters decided to go with the 'fast' group." (https://www.mtbnj.com/forum/threads/hell-of-hunterdon.20590/page-2)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**tucktri [ELITE]:** "Most shoot out at the gun too hard and you spend the rest of the day passing people as they have blown up. I can count on my hands the number of people who have passed me after the first rest stop, about mile 36?" (https://forum.slowtwitch.com/t/hell-of-hunterdon-whos-racing/619169)

**urbantriathlete [ELITE]:** "Bring an extra tube, some nutrition as there are 2 refueling stations but lots of work to be done in between. Layered clothes that you can easily take off as it warms up a bit. Practice riding some gravel if you can. There are a few technical descents and I dont recommend hard braking on soft surfaces." (https://forum.slowtwitch.com/t/hell-of-hunterdon-whos-racing/619169)

**tucktri [ELITE]:** "One word of advice, don't get too drunk the night before. Have made this mistake last two years. Ugh. They do give out these little waffles things at the beginning. I loaded up on them to eat. Very tasty." (https://forum.slowtwitch.com/t/hell-of-hunterdon-whos-racing/619169)

**AnthonyC [UNKNOWN]:** "Technically it's supposed to be the former [a ride] rather than the latter [a race], but trying to hang with the front of the pack makes for something a lot more like a training race. A lot of guys were using it as a warmup for Battenkill." (https://www.mtbnj.com/forum/threads/hell-of-hunterdon.20590/page-2)

**Brian Ignatin (promoter) [COMPETITIVE source]:** Gave "advice to the riders, including warnings about tire pressure and bike handling on the many pot hole-strewn farm roads." (https://www.cxmagazine.com/offseason-fundo-hell-hunterdon-sees-success)

## DNF Risk Factors

**AnthonyC [UNKNOWN]:** "The gravel roads were pretty bad last year; I'm sure they'll be pretty bad this year too. Lots of guys flatted, a few lost control on descents, especially early in the day before the pack strung out." (https://www.mtbnj.com/forum/threads/hell-of-hunterdon.20590/page-2)

**From 2012 race report [COMPETITIVE source]:** "We saw quite a few punctures in some sections (typically when you enter a gravel section at full speed after a downhill)." (https://www.mtbnj.com/forum/threads/hell-of-hunterdon.20590/page-2)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Matthew Vandivort [COMPETITIVE]:** "When we got to the Hell of Hunterdon start line it was easy to see why this was the case: the event seemingly brought out all manner of rider. Sure there were a few 'racer' types from CCAP and a small handful of familiar faces from the (categorized racing oriented) CRCA community. But overall it was a more diverse mix of riders, most of them wearing retail garb (rather than custom team kit) and nearly all carrying a big smile on their faces... my impression was that a significant portion of the participants had probably never done a traditional USAC categorized road race and might never be inclined to do so." (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/2019/3/hell-of-hunterdon-and-a-better-form-of-bikes)

**From 2012 race report [COMPETITIVE source]:** "The event has a Belgian theme, and was accented by a variety of Belgian Flags around the course, and sponsors such as Ridley, Lazer Helmets, and QM Sports Care. All riders received a 'L'Enfer du Hunterdon' logo'd Belgian style beer glass as a finisher's trophy; many of which went directly into service, as River Horse Brewery sponsors the event and supplies beer for the post ride festivities." (https://www.cxmagazine.com/offseason-fundo-hell-hunterdon-sees-success)

**AnthonyC [UNKNOWN]:** "The ride is well supported; lots of food and snacks at stops. I felt a bit too pampered for it to really be that hellish. The course was very well marked; they didn't an excellent job marking out turns, to the point where I rarely (if at all) had to check my cue sheet. And finally, the afterparty: Pure Energy is a great shop, and they know how to throw a great party. Props to Arounkone for the beer and pizza." (https://www.mtbnj.com/forum/threads/hell-of-hunterdon.20590/page-2)

**tucktri [ELITE]:** "Only gripe is that this year they served nasty pasta at the finish as opposed to the pizza they used to serve which was great." (https://forum.slowtwitch.com/t/hell-of-hunterdon-whos-racing/619169)

**renee [UNKNOWN]:** "Glad you were able to ride yesterday. Great weather, beautiful course. Always worth registering if you are in the area. Brian and Kermesse Sport do a terrific job, organizing, communicating, safety, support." (https://forum.slowtwitch.com/t/hell-of-hunterdon-whos-racing/619169)

**Growth trajectory:** The event started with 35 riders in 2009, grew to 252 riders in 2012, had pre-registration reach 400 riders that year, and by 2019 featured roughly 800 riders (sold out).
