# HELLHOLE GRAVEL GRIND STAGE RACE — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Jake Andrews [ELITE]:** Lead the prologue at 24.5 mph for 6 miles, held GC lead until mechanical failure on Stage 2: "his rear derailleur had other plans. The roads of Hellhole are unforgiving and do not discriminate. The landscape of potholes, gravel and mud can take their toll on riders, bikes, and in this case, jockey pulleys." (https://www.cxmagazine.com/hellhole-gravel-grind-stage-race-report)

**Adam Everest [ELITE]:** Former pro from New Zealand racing in 40+ field, bridged solo to lead group on Stage 1: "had soloed across the gap (more like an abyss) to join the four at the front... laid the hammer down to bridge up to the group." Won 40+ overall in 7:29:39. (https://www.cxmagazine.com/hellhole-gravel-grind-stage-race-report)

**Dr. Pain (Justin Pfaff) [ELITE]:** "At about mile 20 of a 74 mile race, in a maze of forest roads and trails, 2 states from my home" after getting dropped: "I responded with an unprintable 'XXXX, I'm done'... From the cockpit, it felt like a lot of 'dodge left', 'dodge right', 'bunny hop', CLANG, DAMN. From each of these your legs took a hit, your arms took a hit, and your hands got tired." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/hell-hole-gravel-grind-stage-race-report-by-dr-pain/)

**Dr. Pain [ELITE]:** On the terrain character: "There was also a cacophony of sounds from chains slapping carbon, aluminum, titanium, and steel. There were also loud cracks, as handlebars twisted in stems. I don't have a word for that sound as rims impact the sides of craters, but I heard that a lot." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/hell-hole-gravel-grind-stage-race-report-by-dr-pain/)

**Libby Skinner [ELITE]:** "Well, hell hath no fury like the Francis Marion National Forest. I got lucky navigating some complicated muddy sections. But I landed in the mud twice. Ginny five times... What unnerved me more than the muddy parts, was the blind, empty potholes that came up very suddenly and the dappled light from the forest making it very difficult to see." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2017-hellhole-gravel-grind-stage-race-south-carolina-by-libby-skinner/)

**Libby Skinner [ELITE]:** On Stage 2: "As if a time trial and a 75-mile ride were not enough, we woke up on Sunday morning ready to do it all again–in reverse... the swamp and the hard fall from Saturday had truly messed with my head. My daring and verve were gone and I knew the worst of the swamp was in the second half of the ride." Cut the ride short Sunday. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2017-hellhole-gravel-grind-stage-race-south-carolina-by-libby-skinner/)

**Ginny Norton [ELITE]:** Won 2017 women's stage race, winning every individual stage. "had raced here the year before, so she knew what we were in for." Fell in the mud 5 times on Stage 1 but still won with an hour lead. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2017-hellhole-gravel-grind-stage-race-south-carolina-by-libby-skinner/)

**Heather Hart [COMPETITIVE]:** On the 2023 45-mile fondo: "I still hadn't caught up on sleep, and I was feeling it. He assures me I'll rally. I'm skeptical, but I hope he's right." After missed turn at mile 24.5: "it was absolutely disheartening to turn around and see a huge pack of riders fly by us." Finished in 4:45:28. (https://hartadventureracing.com/2023-hell-hole-gravel-grind-fondo-race-recap/)

**Heather Hart [COMPETITIVE]:** On Yellow Jacket Road section: "The road is overgrown with grass, however, large holes have recently been filled in with rocks. I'm not sure at what point or size there is a distinction between 'gravel' and 'rocks,' but whatever we rolled through on Yellow Jacket must be that fine line." (https://hartadventureracing.com/2023-hell-hole-gravel-grind-fondo-race-recap/)

**Geoff Duncan [ELITE/RACE ORGANIZER]:** On navigation challenges: "The 'Ride with GPS' app isn't working the way I had hoped. I can't hear the voice cues, and I had forgotten to change the screen settings on my phone, which would shut off and turn black after ten seconds... Garmin, you see, is pretty finicky in what it believes constitutes an actual turn." (https://hartadventureracing.com/2023-hell-hole-gravel-grind-fondo-race-recap/)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Bike Choice [ALL LEVELS]:** First year (2015) podium featured all three bike types: road bike, cross bike, and mountain bike. One rider completed 75 miles on a 36-inch diameter unicycle. (https://www.cxmagazine.com/hellhole-gravel-grind-stage-race-report)

**Tire Width [ALL LEVELS]:** Race website recommends "A minimum of 28c wide tires with tread is recommended. Francis Marion's forest service roads are largely hard packed gravel and pot holes are numerous." (https://www.mtpleasantvelo.org/hellhole-gravel-grind-stage-race)

**Cross Bike Limitations [ELITE]:** Dr. Pain and team pre-rode on cross bikes in 2010: "In retrospect, that was just brutal what it does to your body on a cross bike for that distance." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/hell-hole-gravel-grind-stage-race-report-by-dr-pain/)

**Fat Bike Advantage [COMPETITIVE]:** Geoff Hart rode Surly Ice Cream Truck (fat bike) in 2023: "He's so much stronger than me as a rider that this beast of bicycle actually slows him down just enough that I can sort of keep up... The downside though is that he will blow right through and over holes, logs, and sand pits without flinching." (https://hartadventureracing.com/2023-hell-hole-gravel-grind-fondo-race-recap/)

**Lighting Requirements [ALL LEVELS]:** Friday night prologue requires "front and rear lights are required" as it starts "just before sunset (6:30 PM)." (https://www.mtpleasantvelo.org/hellhole-gravel-grind-stage-race)

**Wildlife Encounters [ELITE]:** Libby Skinner 2017: "Friends asked me about snakes. Yes, they were out there along with wild boar, every imaginable swamp insect, possum, skunk, deer and bear. This is the real South, y'all." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2017-hellhole-gravel-grind-stage-race-south-carolina-by-libby-skinner/)

**General Conditions [COMPETITIVE]:** Heather Hart's experience from Eagle Endurance ultramarathon races in same area: "I have run through 100+ degree mid day temps swatting away horseflies the size of my thumb. I have stomped through knee deep mud puddles in the middle of the night that were sometimes covered in a thin layer of ice." (https://hartadventureracing.com/2023-hell-hole-gravel-grind-fondo-race-recap/)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Course Elevation [ELITE/ORGANIZERS]:** Race organizer Chris Moore: "here in the coastal area of South Carolina and it's flat and, and very flat, we, we will go out for a, I think, I think what the 75 mile one day portion of the hell hole is about 400 feet, about 400 feet of climbing." (https://thegravelride.bike/website/hellhole-gravel-grind-stage-race-south-carolina)

**Potholes [ELITE]:** Dr. Pain describes opening 20 miles: "There was a cacophony of sounds... 'hole', 'big hole', 'hole left', 'hole right', 'go right', 'go left', 'stay middle', 'call out the damn holes'... I saw all sorts of speeds from the 'teens to brief bursts of 30mph." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/hell-hole-gravel-grind-stage-race-report-by-dr-pain/)

**The Mud Hole [ELITE]:** 2015 Stage 1 featured a specific mud crossing: "As 'we' put air in his tire, we looked up the road a few meters to see a mass pileup and conflagration at the mudhole... Neither of us made it through without 'touching' a foot into foot deep mud. It's rumored that the event moto crashed there on a recon mission earlier." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/hell-hole-gravel-grind-stage-race-report-by-dr-pain/)

**Mud Pit Carnage [COMPETITIVE]:** 2023 race: "We begin hitting larger and larger mud pits, each full of lost water bottles, tool kits, and occasionally cyclists with their bikes. In fact, at points people are going backwards on the course, likely looking for important things sacrificed to the puddles." (https://hartadventureracing.com/2023-hell-hole-gravel-grind-fondo-race-recap/)

**Visibility Challenges [ELITE]:** Libby Skinner 2017: "blind, empty potholes that came up very suddenly and the dappled light from the forest making it very difficult to see." Her biggest crash was "on a fast section of hard-packed gravel... I hit the same root that took this guy down. Bam! Out of nowhere." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2017-hellhole-gravel-grind-stage-race-south-carolina-by-libby-skinner/)

**Yellow Jacket Road [COMPETITIVE]:** Heather Hart 2023: "The road clearly hasn't seen much travel in a long time... The road is overgrown with grass, however, large holes have recently been filled in with rocks." (https://hartadventureracing.com/2023-hell-hole-gravel-grind-fondo-race-recap/)

**Overgrown Sections [ELITE]:** Libby Skinner 2017: "a barely navigable section of forest road which gave me the heebie geebies–both sides of the forest brushing cyclists as they rode down a nearly overgrown two-track gravel road." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2017-hellhole-gravel-grind-stage-race-south-carolina-by-libby-skinner/)

**Single Track Sections [ELITE]:** Dr. Pain Sunday Stage 2 around mile 20: "This section was simply brutal. I freely confess that I have absolutely no MTB skills. I don't know what 'technique' might have been used by others, but I could only apply maximum torque and plow through, lurch over, and careen around what ever it was that I couldn't seen in the deep forest underbrush." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/hell-hole-gravel-grind-stage-race-report-by-dr-pain/)

**Aid Station Location:** Single aid station each day at Witherbee Ranger Station: Saturday at mile 29 for stage racers (mile 27 for short course), Sunday at mile 41. (https://www.mtpleasantvelo.org/hellhole-gravel-grind-stage-race)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Prologue Strategy [ELITE]:** Over half the 2015 field averaged better than 21 mph for 6 miles, with Jake Andrews winning at 24.5 mph. The prologue is optional and provides time bonuses for stage racers. (https://www.cxmagazine.com/hellhole-gravel-grind-stage-race-report)

**Stage 1 Opening Pace [ELITE]:** 2015 race featured immediate hard racing: "Stage One started in a panic. Call it nerves, or the fact that the peloton blew past the first turn and was forced to backtrack and chase, but carnage soon ensued with a large crash that caused a split in the field." Front group including Andrews, Crater, Lowe, and Pfaff finished Stage 1 in approximately 3:41 (around 20 mph average for 74 miles). (https://www.cxmagazine.com/hellhole-gravel-grind-stage-race-report)

**Stage Racing Tactics [ELITE]:** 2015 Stage 1: "The four worked simply to maintain the status quo and settle their differences on Stage Two; and with a seemingly comfortable lead over the rest of the field." Stage 2: "By virtue of the opening night prologue, Jake Andrews had claimed a 15 second lead that was now under attack by Crater and Lowe. Working together, the two repeatedly and relentlessly attacked." (https://www.cxmagazine.com/hellhole-gravel-grind-stage-race-report)

**Pacing Reality Check [ELITE]:** Dr. Pain at mile 20 of Stage 2: "Did I mention that this was about mile 20 of a 74 mile race, in a maze of forest roads and trails, 2 states from my home? I was convinced that Pfaff Daddy must have had a mechanical and most certainly needed my help again. I should wait for him." Eventually finished via "Dr. Pain Train... It wasn't a bullet train, or anything like that. It was just a slow steady, 'smell the barn', 'get us home' sort of train." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/hell-hole-gravel-grind-stage-race-report-by-dr-pain/)

**Recovery Between Stages [ELITE]:** Libby Skinner on Sunday morning: "As if a time trial and a 75-mile ride were not enough, we woke up on Sunday morning ready to do it all again–in reverse. Everyone at the starting line trying to make light of soreness, stiffness and what was ahead." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2017-hellhole-gravel-grind-stage-race-south-carolina-by-libby-skinner/)

**Crash Recovery [ELITE]:** Libby Skinner Stage 1: "I trashed my elbow, hip and shoulder but after checking the damage, I was eager to get back on my bike and get going. I had 45 miles to go." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2017-hellhole-gravel-grind-stage-race-south-carolina-by-libby-skinner/)

**Nutrition Strategy [COMPETITIVE]:** Heather Hart: "Thank the cycling and swamp Gods (and the makers of SIS gels), I have indeed rallied, just like my husband said I would. And I didn't feel like stopping just yet, so I suggested we roll through" the mile 29 aid station. (https://hartadventureracing.com/2023-hell-hole-gravel-grind-fondo-race-recap/)

**Women's Strategy [ELITE]:** 2017 race: "There was a general consensus among the women that the difficult potholes would be run, not ridden through." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2017-hellhole-gravel-grind-stage-race-south-carolina-by-libby-skinner/)

## DNF Risk Factors

**DNF Rate [ELITE]:** 2015 stage race: "50% of the stage racers ended the weekend with a DNF." Of 18 stage race starters listed in results, 7 DNF'd. (https://www.cxmagazine.com/hellhole-gravel-grind-stage-race-report)

**Mental Breaking Point [ELITE]:** Dr. Pain at mile 20: "I was completely gassed and unable to close that 25 meters once we got back to the road. Shortly after I 'sat up' for the second time (now at mile 20), Jimbo sailed passed me... I responded with an unprintable 'XXXX, I'm done'." Libby Skinner on Stage 2: "the swamp and the hard fall from Saturday had truly messed with my head. My daring and verve were gone... In the end, I cut my Sunday ride short." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/hell-hole-gravel-grind-stage-race-report-by-dr-pain/, https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2017-hellhole-gravel-grind-stage-race-south-carolina-by-libby-skinner/)

**Dehydration [ELITE]:** Dr. Pain on partner at mile 35: "Pfaff Daddy just sat down in the gravel. It was a bit shocking, since he usually rides me into the ground and has completed a lot of very hard events... I finally convinced him he could just sit on my wheel." Partner "was getting seriously dehydrated or something." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/hell-hole-gravel-grind-stage-race-report-by-dr-pain/)

**Navigation Errors [COMPETITIVE]:** Heather Hart mile 24.5: "we blow right by a turn... Fortunately, the guy we were following noticed this almost immediately, but it was absolutely disheartening to turn around and see a huge pack of riders fly by us. Garmin, you see, is pretty finicky in what it believes constitutes an actual turn, and as such, said nothing at all." (https://hartadventureracing.com/2023-hell-hole-gravel-grind-fondo-race-recap/)

**Cut-Off Times:** Official rules state: "Stage Race - Riders must complete each day's stage within 7 hours. 75 Mile Fondo - Riders must complete the course within 7 hours. 45 Mile Fondo - Riders must complete the 45 miles within 5 hours."
