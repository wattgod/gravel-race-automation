# HEYWOOD RIDE — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Dustin Hruby Wyttenhove [COMPETITIVE]:** "It is an extremely fun and accessible event based out of Northfield, MN which allows riders to get out and experience some really great gravel riding, without the self-seriousness and pressure of the increasingly competitive modern gravel racing scene." (https://pie.bike/blog/heywood-55-ride-report-dustin-hruby-wyttenhove)

**Dustin Hruby Wyttenhove [COMPETITIVE]:** "My training plan involves bike-commuting on my e-cargo bike 3-4 times per week, trying to use my bike for errands whenever possible, and the occasional party/pastry-paced social ride. So while I ride regularly, and have done a few longer events this spring already, I have not exactly been Training with a capital T." (https://pie.bike/blog/heywood-55-ride-report-dustin-hruby-wyttenhove)

**Dustin Hruby Wyttenhove [COMPETITIVE]:** "I never feel as fast on a bike as when I have been on a long gravel section, dealing with the constant bumps and chatter of the surface and the bike, then suddenly turn off onto a paved road... the difference mentally between gravel and road riding provides a similar sort of sudden smoothness." (https://pie.bike/blog/heywood-55-ride-report-dustin-hruby-wyttenhove)

**Dustin Hruby Wyttenhove [COMPETITIVE]:** "After the MMR section I took a break at the lone rest stop on the 55 mile route - the Urland Lutheran Church. I was in and out in about 10 minutes, skipping the food they were selling in place of just an energy bar and filling water from the faucet out back. But stopping for any amount of time allowed the adrenaline to wear off, and the heat of the day was starting to build, so by the time I left the church I was already starting to feel pretty drained and slow." (https://pie.bike/blog/heywood-55-ride-report-dustin-hruby-wyttenhove)

**Atsuko [UNKNOWN]:** "As if the 2 weeks of shorts and T-shirt conditions completely erased my gauge for dressing for 50F, as I packed the night before, I got very tunnelvisioned on my long sleeve Verge skinsuit I normally wore during cyclocross. I haphazardly threw more things like my trusty Podiumwear vest, a longsleeve light weight jacket, kneewarmers, a lightweight Wolf Tooth buff into a tote bag for the morning... Well, apparently I did [need all these things]." (https://atsukos.day/2025/06/13/2025-heywood-ride-report/)

**Atsuko [UNKNOWN]:** "As always the start was fast, and it seemed oddly easy to cruise much faster than I normally would. Keeping an eye on my computer, I was doing 18+ mph for some time! This cannot be right. Not wanted to blow up in the first 20 miles even though I was feeling pretty good, I slowed up and let myself drift backwards through the crowd." (https://atsukos.day/2025/06/13/2025-heywood-ride-report/)

**Atsuko [UNKNOWN]:** "Had to walk the Shady Lane climb, but slurped some maple syrup while walking, which was glorious. And then the coursed turned into the headwind. Now it all made sense why the first 20 miles were so fast. I'll be honest, the headwind was miserable riding alone! I hopped on a couple speedy trains going by but nothing was very sustainable for very long so I excused myself off. After 2? hours of nasty headwind that gusted enough to push me around on the bike, the Northfield water tower came into view." (https://atsukos.day/2025/06/13/2025-heywood-ride-report/)

**Marty Larson (Organizer) [ELITE]:** "We offer something that a lot of gravel rides don't. It's that space for people of any flavor to come down and be amongst familiars and amongst people that are going to treat them with respect." (https://www.thenxrth.com/post/no-sponsors-no-podium-the-heywood-ride-at-the-heart-of-grassroots-community-gravel)

**Marty Larson (Organizer) [ELITE]:** "This is just a bike ride. We're doing this to provide a space for people to come and ride their bikes. It's not an expo. It's not a trade show." (https://www.thenxrth.com/post/no-sponsors-no-podium-the-heywood-ride-at-the-heart-of-grassroots-community-gravel)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Atsuko [UNKNOWN]:** Used Panaracer Gravel King Slick TLR 750bx38mm tires on a custom steel 650b CX bike (Cake Merveilleux) with Shimano 105 Mechanical, Nitto cockpit, and Wolftooth 38T Oval x 11-36 11s gearing. Reported no mechanicals. (https://atsukos.day/2025/06/13/2025-heywood-ride-report/)

**Official recommendation [UNKNOWN]:** "Nearly any tire will work, though we suggest staying above 32c." (https://theheywoodride.com/)

**Dustin Hruby Wyttenhove [COMPETITIVE]:** Had issues with Garmin not connecting to satellites throughout the ride, opted to turn it off and ride without data. Notes this created uncertainty during the final headwind section about remaining distance. (https://pie.bike/blog/heywood-55-ride-report-dustin-hruby-wyttenhove)

## Weather Experienced

**2024 (May 17):** Hot conditions. Dustin noted "the heat of the day was starting to build" after the rest stop and mentioned "the occasional weird spot where the wind would suddenly be blocked by the trees and I could feel the full heat of the day." Steady 20-30 mph headwinds on the return to Northfield. (https://pie.bike/blog/heywood-55-ride-report-dustin-hruby-wyttenhove)

**2025 (May 17):** Cold conditions. Atsuko described it as "rudely chilly day, in comparison to the midsummer weather we had had leading up to the day" with temperatures around 50°F. Many riders wore full length tights, gloves, and jackets. Atsuko noted "all my layers put on resulted in a comfortable outfit for the day. Not too hot and not too cold." Later faced significant headwinds with gusts "enough to push me around on the bike." (https://atsukos.day/2025/06/13/2025-heywood-ride-report/)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**MMR (Minimum Maintenance Road) Climb:** The signature feature of the route. Dustin [COMPETITIVE] described it as "a seemingly vertical wall of gravel strewn with riders" with a bright yellow warning sign stating "MINIMUM MAINTENANCE ROAD - Travel At Your Own Risk." Notes it has multiple pitches and is "tree-shaded tunnel of the climb." In 2023, he got stuck behind another rider and couldn't make it up; in 2024 he succeeded by picking a clear line with momentum. (https://pie.bike/blog/heywood-55-ride-report-dustin-hruby-wyttenhove)

**Shady Lane Climb:** Atsuko [UNKNOWN] had to walk this climb, consuming maple syrup while walking. (https://atsukos.day/2025/06/13/2025-heywood-ride-report/)

**Oxford Mill Ruins:** Located at the bottom of the third descent, an old grain mill along the river that operated from 1878 to 1905. Dustin noted he forgot to stop in 2024. (https://pie.bike/blog/heywood-55-ride-report-dustin-hruby-wyttenhove)

**First 10 miles (55/60-mile route):** Follows the Cannon River northeast towards Cannon Falls with tailwind conditions. Dustin described it as "an absolute blast" with smooth, fast riding. (https://pie.bike/blog/heywood-55-ride-report-dustin-hruby-wyttenhove)

**Hills after mile 10:** After turning into wind and hills, the route features "three climbs, all about the same length, each immediately followed by a speedy descent back down." (https://pie.bike/blog/heywood-55-ride-report-dustin-hruby-wyttenhove)

**Post-MMR section:** Described as "some of the nicest and prettiest of the ride, descending down a valley to the Little Cannon River along winding rural roads surrounded by greenery and farmland, before climbing back out on the other side." (https://pie.bike/blog/heywood-55-ride-report-dustin-hruby-wyttenhove)

**Final approach to Northfield:** Long straight return with significant headwind exposure. Dustin noted "about 5 miles from the turn back to town, and half of that was paved" though it felt much longer while riding. Final blocks go "past houses and the golf course on the way back to Central Park." (https://pie.bike/blog/heywood-55-ride-report-dustin-hruby-wyttenhove)

**Course signage:** Dustin [COMPETITIVE] noted "the course signage was on-point" making navigation easy even without GPS. (https://pie.bike/blog/heywood-55-ride-report-dustin-hruby-wyttenhove)

**General terrain:** Official description notes "low trafficked, mostly one lane wide and vary from long rollers to short, punchy climbs. You'll pass active farms, always be on the lookout for machinery. You'll also see your fair share of wooded lanes. From easy cruisers to tough climbs and fast descents. There is a little bit of pavement, but only enough to make important connections. Our surfaces are generally smooth and the gravel is downright pleasant." (https://theheywoodride.com/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Atsuko [UNKNOWN]:** Started hoping to find a 14 mph group to ride with. Got caught up in the fast start doing 18+ mph, then deliberately slowed to avoid blowing up, settling into 13 mph pace. Never found a sustainable group. Finished 58.39 miles at 11.3 mph average. (https://atsukos.day/2025/06/13/2025-heywood-ride-report/)

**Atsuko [UNKNOWN] - Nutrition:** "1 sleeve Clif Shotblock (salted watermelon), a bag of Haribo Twin Snakes, 100 ml Kirkland pure maple syrup" for the 60-mile route. (https://atsukos.day/2025/06/13/2025-heywood-ride-report/)

**Dustin Hruby Wyttenhove [COMPETITIVE] - Pacing:** Got caught up in "race mode very early" due to chaotic start and fast first sections. Notes "Chatter died down as everyone put their heads down" when hitting the hills and headwind around mile 10. Used 7-mile paved section to "hop into some pace lines and put some power down, while also taking a break and letting my mind regroup." (https://pie.bike/blog/heywood-55-ride-report-dustin-hruby-wyttenhove)

**Dustin Hruby Wyttenhove [COMPETITIVE] - Rest Stop Strategy:** "In and out in about 10 minutes, skipping the food they were selling in place of just an energy bar and filling water from the faucet out back." Notes that stopping allowed adrenaline to wear off and he felt drained afterward. (https://pie.bike/blog/heywood-55-ride-report-dustin-hruby-wyttenhove)

**Dustin Hruby Wyttenhove [COMPETITIVE] - Nutrition:** Used "emergency caffeine gel" in final miles when starting to bonk, though only had ~3 miles remaining. (https://pie.bike/blog/heywood-55-ride-report-dustin-hruby-wyttenhove)

**Course flexibility:** Riders can choose their distance on ride day without switching registration. "If you decide on ride day that you want to ride a different course, feel free! We don't need you to switch your registration or let us know which route you decide on." Atsuko [UNKNOWN] noted: "Though I had gotten on the bike with the escape route of 30 miles in mind, I completely missed the signs pointing out the turnoff. I guess I was in it for 60 miles." (https://theheywoodride.com/ride & https://atsukos.day/2025/06/13/2025-heywood-ride-report/)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Wind exposure:** Multiple riders noted significant headwinds on the return to Northfield. Dustin [COMPETITIVE] described "steady 20-30 mph headwinds" and noted "I could have sworn it was a quarter of the route" when discussing the final 5 miles. Atsuko [UNKNOWN] reported "2? hours of nasty headwind that gusted enough to push me around on the bike." (https://pie.bike/blog/heywood-55-ride-report-dustin-hruby-wyttenhove & https://atsukos.day/2025/06/13/2025-heywood-ride-report/)

**Chain issues:** Atsuko mentioned "being very glad I didn't snap my chain, twice" suggesting this was a near-miss mechanical issue. (https://atsukos.day/2025/06/13/2025-heywood-ride-report/)

**Rest stop timing:** Dustin [COMPETITIVE] noted feeling "pretty drained and slow" after stopping at the church rest stop around mid-course, as "stopping for any amount of time allowed the adrenaline to wear off, and the heat of the day was starting to build." (https://pie.bike/blog/heywood-55-ride-report-dustin-hruby-wyttenhove)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**No podium/No timing:** "We offer a decidedly non-race experience. There is no chip timing, no sprint finish, no podium. If you want those things, there are hundreds of other events to choose from." Finisher photos include time of day but are not separated by route. (https://theheywoodride.com/ride)

**Accessibility focus:** Registration is $25 flat (previously was pay-what-you-want). Event includes a "pay for another rider" program with ~100 riders typically contributing, creating a community fund for those needing financial support, "no questions asked." (https://www.thenxrth.com/post/no-sponsors-no-podium-the-heywood-ride-at-the-heart-of-grassroots-community-gravel)

**Growth:** Grew from 800 riders in 2022 to nearly 1,200 registered in 2024. Organizers believe they could eventually accommodate 2,000 participants while maintaining grassroots approach. (https://www.thenxrth.com/post/no-sponsors-no-podium-the-heywood-ride-at-the-heart-of-grassroots-community-gravel)

**Finish area:** Located in Central Park in Northfield with "tree-arched sidewalk" serving as finishing chute. "Instead of big branded inflatable arches riders follow the tree-arched sidewalk into the center of park, with friends, fans, and fellow riders cheering them to the finish line at the center of the plaza." 2025 added music and food trucks with space for riders to set up tents. (https://pie.bike/blog/heywood-55-ride-report-dustin-hruby-wyttenhove & https://www.thenxrth.com/post/no-sponsors-no-podium-the-heywood-ride-at-the-heart-of-grassroots-community-gravel)

**E-bikes welcome:** "Riders can ride whatever sort of bike they want, including e-bikes." Dustin gave "shoutout to the dad I've seen 2 years in a row bringing their toddler along on the back of the e-cargo bike." (https://pie.bike/blog/heywood-55-ride-report-dustin-hruby-wyttenhove)

**Minimal support:** "Support is minimal on the ride, but depending on the distance there are one or two stops where riders can rest and refill water." The 55/60-mile route has one rest stop at Urland Lutheran Church. (https://pie.bike/blog/heywood-55-ride-report-dustin-hruby-wyttenhove)

**No corporate sponsorship:** Run by 3 core organizers (Ben Witt, Marty Larson, Mike Lehmkhul) plus their spouses and handful of volunteers. "They've avoided corporate sponsorships and maintained a focus on the riding experience." Costs covered primarily by donations, with largest expenses being insurance and port-o-johns. (https://www.thenxrth.com/post/no-sponsors-no-podium-the-heywood-ride-at-the-heart-of-grassroots-community-gravel)

**History/Heritage:** Event has roots in the Almanzo ride started by Chris Skogen in early 2010s, which relocated to Northfield in 2019. After COVID pause, Heywood organizers took over in 2022 with Skogen's blessing, maintaining similar philosophy of accessibility and welcoming all riders. (https://www.thenxrth.com/post/no-sponsors-no-podium-the-heywood-ride-at-the-heart-of-grassroots-community-gravel & https://www.thenxrth.com/post/meet-the-heywood-your-new-favorite-pay-what-you-want-gravel-event)

**Northfield as destination:** "Northfield is a college town of approximately 20,000 people. We have a thriving downtown with cafés, bakeries, and lots of stores with actual personality... Nerstrand State Park and Caron Park are a ten-minute drive from our start line." Town offers "three excellent breweries, a distillery, and a cidery" for post-ride. Free camping available at Sechler Park (no facilities, no big rigs/trailers). (https://theheywoodride.com/ & https://www.thenxrth.com/post/meet-the-heywood-your-new-favorite-pay-what-you-want-gravel-event)

**Distance options:** 30, 60, 110, 165, and 390-mile routes. The 390-mile ultra starts Thursday night at 10pm; other distances start Saturday morning at staggered times. "The 30 and 60-mile options frequently attract first-time gravel riders."
