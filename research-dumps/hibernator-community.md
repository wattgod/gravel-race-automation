# HIBERNATOR — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Lawrence Bate [COMPETITIVE]:** "This is a new event in the calendar, and being part of the 2025/26 Outside Winter Race Series it promised to be a good one. What could be better than running 24km in the middle of January, taking in Stanage Edge and Bamford Edge as well as some typically boggy bits across the moors?... With all our chatting, interspersed by banter with the hardy marshals at the various checkpoints, time flew by. As we got to the last couple of miles, we saw a big group of four or five other pairs coming up the hill behind us and Dan yelled 'I'm not competitive but I really want to beat them'. So it was time to put the hammer down, dig deep and then leg it down the hill to the finish." Finished in 2:38:37 in M category.

**Note:** This appears to be a RUNNING event called "Hathersage Hibernator," NOT the Vermont gravel cycling event.

**John Sumner [COMPETITIVE]:** "One night at 3AM in Early October I was unable to sleep. Found myself looking at Bikereg for a MTB race. The Hibernator came up and I assumed it was longer and renamed Circumburke. Nope, not the case at all!... Soon, I realized you can just expect to climb then enjoy fast descents with a lot of man made birms to lean into around corners. Lots of roots and rocks with mostly leaf covered singletrack. The low temps and light rain made me trust my Schwable Racing Ralph and Nobby Nic around corners. However, the ground was soft and this was sapping my speed. Also, I found my rear tire was a bit soft so I stopped to add air. This made a big difference in energy consumption... A rare moment when I overtook a couple guys down a hill, we wound up taking a wrong turn, then the whole group behind also followed. I saw on my K2 the correct way and told them, however they were not sure. I pushed on and did not see many of those folks again... Unfortunately, what I did not realize was that the last two miles was a climb. So once again settled into a grinding climb. At the top we had a fast downhill on a gravel road to the finish. Overall I was in the 30's out of 86 ish, therefore not a bad day in the saddle for me." (https://www.bikeman.com/blog/the-hibernator.htms)

**Dan (Active Minded Professor) [UNKNOWN]:** "Approximately 60 riders rolled out to a controlled mass start with temps in the high 30's. We were soon greeted to a few miles of uphill gravel road climbing before exiting the road for some high grass bushwhacking and class IV adventure. At this point, I was wishing I threw the 650b x 47's on the trail donkey. I did have to dismount once in the heavy mud, but I'm used to this now. I knew what I signed up for. When we emerged from the woods it was back to climbing, a long 4+ mile climb on Victory and Radar roads until the first aid station at mile 15. I was already 1.5 hours in... After a series of scenic gravel rollers and one super steep climb — my head unit was bouncing from 17%-20% elevation — I rolled into the second aid station at mile 24 at Honest to Goodness Farm. The gracious hosts presented me a pumpkin chocolate cookie, or maybe was it two? I washed it down with hot apple cider (homemade and pressed right there) spiked with Vermont Maple Syrup…OMG that hit the spot... As I glanced down at my Garmin I realized I had less than 5 miles to go and wondered if I cut my day too short. Then I recognized where I was (a little flashback from the last couple years of Rasputitsa), and I remembered what was just ahead when I turned on to Pinkham Road. What's one more long hill climb?... However, the surprises were not over. The finish included a rip down Roly Grail flow trail to Burke Mtn. It was a bit of a challenge on the gravel bike but pure fun to end an exciting day."

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**John Sumner [COMPETITIVE]:** Successfully used Schwalbe Racing Ralph and Nobby Nic tires in low temps and light rain conditions with leaf-covered singletrack. Notes: "The low temps and light rain made me trust my Schwalbe Racing Ralph and Nobby Nic around corners." Initially ran rear tire too soft but stopping to add air "made a big difference in energy consumption." Also credits Kona HeiHei race Light frame. "No flat tires, punctures, mechanicals and comfort all day!" (https://www.bikeman.com/blog/the-hibernator.htms)

**Dan (Active Minded Professor) [UNKNOWN]:** Regretted not using 650b x 47mm tires when encountering heavy mud and bushwhacking sections: "At this point, I was wishing I threw the 650b x 47's on the trail donkey." Successfully completed on gravel bike setup but noted the singletrack finish "was a bit of a challenge on the gravel bike." (https://activemindedprofessor.com/ride-report-the-hibernator/)

## Weather Experienced

**Mid-October Event (East Burke, VT):** High 30s°F at start, light rain during event. Leaf-covered trails and soft ground conditions. (https://activemindedprofessor.com/ride-report-the-hibernator/ and https://www.bikeman.com/blog/the-hibernator.htms)

**January Event (Hathersage, UK - Running):** January 17th, 2026 with "pretty much perfect" conditions for moorland running. Decision made not to wear Exospikes proved correct. (https://www.steelcitystriders.co.uk/2026/hathersage-hibernator-race-report-and-results/)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**East Burke, Vermont Event:**

**Initial Sections:** "A few miles of uphill gravel road climbing before exiting the road for some high grass bushwhacking and class IV adventure." One rider had to dismount once in heavy mud. (https://activemindedprofessor.com/ride-report-the-hibernator/)

**Major Climb:** "Long 4+ mile climb on Victory and Radar roads until the first aid station at mile 15." Rider was 1.5 hours in at this point. (https://activemindedprofessor.com/ride-report-the-hibernator/)

**Descent Characteristics:** "Three-mile descent... wasn't as easy as I hoped. Leaf covered and hiding potential potholes in some of the old tarred road sections, I backed off a bit." (https://activemindedprofessor.com/ride-report-the-hibernator/)

**Steep Climbing:** "One super steep climb — my head unit was bouncing from 17%-20% elevation" between the aid stations. (https://activemindedprofessor.com/ride-report-the-hibernator/)

**Final Sections:** Pinkham Road includes "one more long hill climb" with less than 5 miles to go. "The finish included a rip down Roly Grail flow trail to Burke Mtn." (https://activemindedprofessor.com/ride-report-the-hibernator/)

**General Course Character [COMPETITIVE perspective]:** "You can just expect to climb then enjoy fast descents with a lot of man made birms to lean into around corners. Lots of roots and rocks with mostly leaf covered singletrack." Soft ground conditions. (https://www.bikeman.com/blog/the-hibernator.htms)

**Course Markings:** "White course markers" used. Course is "fully marked/gps'd." (https://www.bikeman.com/blog/the-hibernator.htms and https://www.bikesignup.com/Race/VT/WestBurke/HibernatorGravel)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**50K Route Pacing [UNKNOWN level]:** First aid station at mile 15 reached after 1.5 hours (average ~10 mph including climbing and technical sections). Second aid station at mile 24 reached with under 5 miles remaining. Total course distance slightly over stated mileage based on rider's surprise at proximity to finish. (https://activemindedprofessor.com/ride-report-the-hibernator/)

**Navigation:** GPS device recommended. One rider successfully used Garmin K2 with pre-loaded RWGPS map to identify correct route when group took wrong turn. "A rare moment when I overtook a couple guys down a hill, we wound up taking a wrong turn, then the whole group behind also followed. I saw on my K2 the correct way and told them." (https://www.bikeman.com/blog/the-hibernator.htms)

**Course Distance Reality Check [COMPETITIVE]:** "For some reason I thought it was 48 miles and 4800' climbing, because RWGPS told me this. Again nope." Actual course differed from what navigation showed. (https://www.bikeman.com/blog/the-hibernator.htms)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Laona, WI Event (The Bear 100):** "Laona Rescue will be providing support until 5 PM. If you are not very confident of finishing before then, you should choose a shorter route." This suggests cutoff time is a real consideration. (https://www.thebear100.com/about-1)

**Navigation Errors:** Multiple riders took wrong turns and followed each other off course, suggesting course marking may be challenging in certain sections. (https://www.bikeman.com/blog/the-hibernator.htms)

**Equipment Issues:** Riders running insufficient tire pressure lost significant energy. One competitive rider noted stopping to add air "made a big difference in energy consumption." (https://www.bikeman.com/blog/the-hibernator.htms)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Event Character:** "Our grassroots vibe offers a friendly environment for the entire family that combines exclusive terrain and breathtaking views for an unmatched journey throughout our backyard... We are 100% about community and supporting our area local businesses." (https://crosscycleadventures.com/dirt/thehibernator.html)

**Aid Station Experience:** "The gracious hosts presented me a pumpkin chocolate cookie, or maybe was it two? I washed it down with hot apple cider (homemade and pressed right there) spiked with Vermont Maple Syrup…OMG that hit the spot." At Honest to Goodness Farm aid station. (https://activemindedprofessor.com/ride-report-the-hibernator/)

**Race Promoter Philosophy:** "It goes beyond being just a cycling event and embodies a grassroots, self-supported test of mental, physical, and spiritual fortitude that unites participants with lasting memories and sense of accomplishment." Features "wood-fired maple syrup and pumpkin chocolate chip cookies" at feed zones, "incredible locally sourced post-race food & small-town community vibes" and "delicious Vermont beer." (https://www.bikesignup.com/Race/VT/WestBurke/HibernatorGravel)

**Camping:** "FREE all weekend (a donation is welcome to support the landowners Ben & Kim) with no reservations needed!" and "spacious FREE field camping" at venue. (https://www.bikesignup.com/Race/VT/WestBurke/HibernatorGravel and https://crosscycleadventures.com/dirt/thehibernator.html)

**Post-Race Food:** "Hook & Peel pizza... slinging delicious pies on Sunday, while The Spicy Spoke will have a sick farm-to-table spread on Saturday." (https://www.bikesignup.com/Race/VT/WestBurke/HibernatorGravel)

**Family Activities:** "Kids tractor hay rides & hay bail maze" (https://crosscycleadventures.com/dirt/thehibernator.html)

**Marshaling:** "Hardy marshals at the various checkpoints" with opportunities for banter. (https://www.steelcitystriders.co.uk/2026/hathersage-hibernator-race-report-and-results/)

**Overall Assessment [COMPETITIVE]:** "This is a very well run event. Check it out!... This was a grassroots thriller. It pushes all the buttons. Super hard climbs, white knuckle descents, class IV gnar, single track flow, and honest to Vermont hospitality and beauty." (https://www.bikeman.com/blog/the-hibernator.htms and https://activemindedprofessor.com/ride-report-the-hibernator/)
