# HIGHLANDS GRAVEL CLASSIC — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Deanna Duke [UNKNOWN]:** "I thought I'd do a little (okay, very long) race report of the 2023 Highlands Gravel Classic in Fayetteville, AR, which was the only U.S. qualifying event for the UCI Gravel Worlds event in Veneto, Italy, in October, 2023. I registered back in December (just as I was recovering from Covid) with the intent to ride and possibly race, but mostly to support my boyfriend. The cool thing about this event is that the top 25% in each age category automatically qualifies for the Worlds." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/deannas-story-highlands-gravel-classic)

**Deanna Duke [UNKNOWN]:** "Race day. It was hot. It was humid. It had some technically challenging sections. At the bottom of the first sketchy descent, there were literally bodies waiting for aid cars. I was told there was worse to come. I persevered. I figured I didn't crash and I so far haven't soiled myself, so I soldiered on. More bodies. It will be fine." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/deannas-story-highlands-gravel-classic)

**Deanna Duke [UNKNOWN]:** "Near the top of a long climb where nearly everyone was walking and my forward progress was pretty grim due to heat exposure, a support 4x4 came down the hill. I watched as the two men in front of me got water bottles, pouring water over their helmets in slow motion. I couldn't wait to fill my pack. I was going to make it! I got to the support and plunged my hand into the barrel of EMPTY WATER BOTTLES. There were none left. Did I swear? You bet your sweet southern patootie I did. How many horrific miles until the next aid station? 14 mostly uphill miles." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/deannas-story-highlands-gravel-classic)

**Deanna Duke [UNKNOWN]:** "My race plan was going great! I felt strong. I couldn't wait for miles 40-52, which played to my advantage. I channeled Rebecca. Nibble, nibble, sip sip. It got hotter, I passed people, I started running out of water in spite of having a pack and bottles." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/deannas-story-highlands-gravel-classic)

**Deanna Duke [UNKNOWN]:** "I do not like DNFing. I do not like it one bit. But I was in good company. 37 people got carted off the race that morning. About 20% of the field. I was one of the lucky ones. The woman in the van sitting next to me had crashed at the descent at mile 12. She was impressed I made it to mile 30. Lots of broken bodies and bikes." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/deannas-story-highlands-gravel-classic)

**Maude Farrell [ELITE - 2nd place 2024]:** "I just couldn't quite keep up with her [Jenna Rinehart] on the descents" (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/results-jenna-rinehart-and-brennan-wertz-win-highlands-gravel-classic/)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**TangoDeltaFoxtrot [UNKNOWN]:** Asked about tire choice for the race, noting: "I just learned that my current tires, the Bontrager GR1 Team Issue 40, are some of the slowest tires on the market. My initial thoughts are to choose either the Challenge Getaway Pro HTLR 40 or the Continental Terra Speed TR 40 since they both seem to have decently low rolling resistance and moderate puncture protection. My bike can really only fit a 40mm tires at most, so I'll want to stay at that 40mm size. All of my local gravel roads have a lot of super soft sand and loose sandy gravel, so even 40mm is way too small most times. This race is only 66 miles long, so it will be just an absolute smashfest. With such a short race, I don't want to miss out on a good performance because of slow tires or poor tread choice."

## Weather Experienced

**2023 Race Conditions:** Deanna Duke reported: "Did I mention it was hot? We went for a pre-race recon ride on Tuesday and quickly realized that heat + humidity plus a lot of elevation gain in the form of a million tiny hills far exceeds my capacity for cooling. I knew the race on Saturday, with predicted temperatures of 95 and high humidity, was going to be a challenge." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/deannas-story-highlands-gravel-classic)

**2023 Heat Impact:** "37 people got carted off the race that morning. About 20% of the field" due to heat-related issues. (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/deannas-story-highlands-gravel-classic)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**TheCrowsSoundNice [UNKNOWN]:** Asked about terrain characteristics: "What's the ratio of chunky to smooth gravel? How chunky? And does it get muddy if it rains? Does it turn into peanut butter mud or not as bad? And I'm guessing there's a lot of shade?" (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/148i9uj/highlands_gravel_classic_in_arkansas_how_chunky/)

**Course Profile:** "The course varies from an elevation of 1,200 ft. (365m) and progresses to an elevation of 2,200 ft. (670m). The long course has a total elevation of 4,850 ft. (1,480m) and will challenge riders with rolling hills combined with scenic vistas and streams to keep the competitors on their toes. The shorter distance has just over 3,700 ft. (1,130m). Both courses can be considered challenging with moderate to steep elevation on undulating gravel roads." (https://ucigravelworldseries.com/en/fayetteville/)

**Key Climb Details:** "The most arduous climb stretches a full 2.9 miles (4.7km), with the highest point of the day reached at 2,200 ft on a sprawling ridgeline 33 miles into the course - all with views of the Boston Mountain range rolling across the skyline." (https://www.experiencefayetteville.com/experience/cycling/highlands-gravel-classic)

**Technical Sections:** "At the bottom of the first sketchy descent, there were literally bodies waiting for aid cars. I was told there was worse to come." The woman in Deanna's support van "had crashed at the descent at mile 12." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/deannas-story-highlands-gravel-classic)

**Course Characteristics:** "Featuring miles of canopy covered gravel roads, riders can expect continuously changing terrain through the rural backcountry of the Ozarks – with over a dozen climbs" (https://ucigravelworldseries.com/en/fayetteville/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Crystal Anthony [ELITE - 2023 & 2025 Winner]:** "Anthony launched her attack with 13 miles to race, where a four-mile downhill section of pavement transitioned to a 12% gravel ascent of about a half a mile in length. Rinehart was able to react, but the pair dropped King, who finished 3:36 back." (https://www.cyclingnews.com/races/uci-gravel-world-series-events-2025/highlands-gravel-classic/results/)

**Jenna Rinehart [ELITE - 2024 Winner, 2025 2nd Place]:** "Rinehart had to stage an early chase after dropping her chain within the first few miles of the 67-mile race. She caught Farrell and Oliveira Parks, and the trio worked together until they dropped Oliveira Parks. Then, Rinehart put a small gap on Farrell with about 10 miles left and managed to hold it until the finish line." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/results-jenna-rinehart-and-brennan-wertz-win-highlands-gravel-classic/)

**Men's Elite Breakaway [ELITE]:** "The three men's podium finishers [Brennan Wertz, Cobe Freeburn, Nicholas Roche] got away around 15 miles into the race." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/results-jenna-rinehart-and-brennan-wertz-win-highlands-gravel-classic/)

**2025 Men's Finish [ELITE]:** "Skyler Taylor outsprinted Tim McBirney for victory in a time of 3 hours, 29 minutes and 10 seconds after the pair had got away from what had been a group of four." (https://www.cyclingnews.com/races/uci-gravel-world-series-events-2025/highlands-gravel-classic/results/)

**Deanna Duke [UNKNOWN]:** "My race plan was going great! I felt strong. I couldn't wait for miles 40-52, which played to my advantage. I channeled Rebecca. Nibble, nibble, sip sip." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/deannas-story-highlands-gravel-classic)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Heat-Related DNFs (2023):** "37 people got carted off the race that morning. About 20% of the field" - mainly due to heat stroke and heat exposure. (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/deannas-story-highlands-gravel-classic)

**Crashes:** Multiple crashes reported at technical descents, particularly "at the descent at mile 12" and "at the bottom of the first sketchy descent, there were literally bodies waiting for aid cars." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/deannas-story-highlands-gravel-classic)

**Water Supply Issues:** "Near the top of a long climb where nearly everyone was walking and my forward progress was pretty grim due to heat exposure, a support 4x4 came down the hill. I watched as the two men in front of me got water bottles, pouring water over their helmets in slow motion. I couldn't wait to fill my pack. I was going to make it! I got to the support and plunged my hand into the barrel of EMPTY WATER BOTTLES. There were none left... How many horrific miles until the next aid station? 14 mostly uphill miles." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/deannas-story-highlands-gravel-classic)

**Mechanical Issues:** Jenna Rinehart [ELITE] "dropped her chain within the first few miles of the 67-mile race" but was able to recover and still win in 2024. (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/results-jenna-rinehart-and-brennan-wertz-win-highlands-gravel-classic/)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Low Turnout Noted (2025):** "In the country that started the gravel racing revolution 20 years ago, only 407 riders showed up at the Highlands Gravel Classic in Arkansas, USA on Saturday to try and qualify for the 2025 UCI Gravel World Championships. That is a far cry from Belgium's sold-out Turnhout Gravel race last month that attracted 2500 racers." (https://granfondodailynews.com/2025/04/27/uci-highlands-gravel-classic-results-407-riders-at-first-usa-worlds-qualifier/)

**UCI Worlds Qualifier Status:** "The cool thing about this event is that the top 25% in each age category automatically qualifies for the Worlds." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/deannas-story-highlands-gravel-classic)

**Qualification System:** "As per the official qualification system for the 2026 UCI Gravel World Championships, each UCI Gravel World Series event grants qualification rights for the UCI Gravel World Championships for those riders finishing in the first 25% of their category. The 25% is calculated based on the number of starters in each category, and not on the number of riders having finished the race." (https://www.highlandsgravelclassic.com/Race/HighlandsGravelClassic/Page-13)

**Area Amenities:** Deanna Duke noted the rental house had "a huge pond with many resident bullfrogs, turtles, bass, and an elusive water snake. Each evening we enjoyed the parade of fireflies, raccoons, red cardinals and, on our last night, a red fox, jaunting through our backyard." She also advised: "If you ride bikes, go to Bentonville/Fayetteville! Just go when it ain't so freaking hot." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/deannas-story-highlands-gravel-classic)
