## **TERRAIN & COURSE (Ozark Specifics)**
**The Surface:** This is **95% gravel**. The gravel in the Ozarks is distinct: it is often "chunky, loose, and sharp." It is not smooth champagne gravel; it is a "rugged rhythm" of constant rollers.
**The Vibe:** Unlike ultra-endurance events (Unbound), this is a "smashfest." It is short (~4 hours for winners) and high-intensity from the gun.
**Key Features:**
* **Canopy Covered:** Much of the race is under tree cover, which helps with heat but can make visibility tricky on fast descents.
* **Rolling Hills:** There are no massive mountain passes, but the climbing is relentless. It is "death by a thousand cuts" with over a dozen distinct climbs.
* **Drainage:** The course generally drains well. It does **not** turn into unrideable "peanut butter" mud like Kansas, but heavy rain can wash out the gravel, creating dangerous "trenches" or ruts.
## **TECHNICAL ANALYSIS**
* **Descent Danger:** The downhills are fast and loose. Riders report that "limited visibility due to trees" combined with loose corners causes crashes.
* **Fences:** A specific hazard mentioned by riders: "There are some downhill sections with limited visibility... which caused a number of riders to crash into fences because they couldn't slow down quickly enough."
* **Comparison to Big Sugar:** Similar terrain (NW Arkansas chunk), but the Highlands course is more condensed. It demands punchy power and high-speed handling skills rather than just diesel endurance.
## **WEATHER HISTORY**
* **Late April in Arkansas:** Highly variable. It can be 80°F (27°C) and humid, or 40°F (4°C) and raining.
* **Mud Factor:** Low risk of drivetrain-destroying mud, but high risk of slick, dangerous corners if wet.
* **Policy:** "We will ride rain, snow, sleet or shine."
## **REDDIT THREADS**
**Thread:** "Tire choice for Highlands Gravel Classic"
* **Quote:** "This race is only 66 miles long, so it will be just an absolute smashfest."
* **Quote:** "Arkansas gravel is pretty chunky to be honest. It's chunky, loose, and can be sharp."
* **URL:** <u>[Reddit Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/18ax9t0/tire_choice_for_highlands_gravel_classic/)</u>**Thread:** "Highlands Gravel Classic in Arkansas - How chunky?"
* **Quote:** "When it does rain, however, the chunky loose gravel can wash away so you'll have to be mindful of low spots where it might create trenches in the road."

## **EQUIPMENT CONSENSUS**
* **Tires:** **40mm - 45mm** is the gold standard.
	* *Consensus:* **Reinforced sidewalls are mandatory.** The sharp Ozark flint slices light tires.
	* *Recommended:* Pirelli Cinturato M/RC, Specialized Pathfinder Pro (42mm+), Vittoria Mezcal (for wet years).
	* *Avoid:* Tires with thin sidewalls (e.g., standard Rene Herse extralights) unless you are extremely skilled at line choice.
* **Gearing:** A 1:1 ratio is sufficient for most (e.g., 40t front / 42t rear), but a spinning gear helps on the steep kicks late in the race.
* **Bike:** Gravel bike is faster than a hardtail. The course is not rough enough to warrant a MTB, but big tires help.
## **LOGISTICS**
* **Start Location:** **Goshen, AR** (a small community ~15 mins east of Fayetteville).
* **Lodging:** Stay in **Fayetteville**. It is a major college town (Univ. of Arkansas) with ample hotels and Airbnbs.
	* *Tip:* Look for hotels near the University or the Dickson Street entertainment district for food options.
* **Airport:** **XNA (Northwest Arkansas National Airport)** is the closest major hub.
* **Parking:** On-site parking at the Goshen Community Center is provided.
