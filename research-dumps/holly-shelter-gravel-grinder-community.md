# HOLLY SHELTER GRAVEL GRINDER — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

The Holly Shelter Game Land features **"all types of road surfaces"** including gravel roads, dirt roads, packed and loose sand roads, and **"a few wet areas depending on what kind of rain we get before the race"** (trans-sylvaniaproductions.com). The official description notes: **"It sure isn't a true Gravel Grinder without some mud holes right?"**

**Ray George [UNKNOWN]:** From his reconnaissance rides, described the gravel as **"a mix of sand, mushy sand, gravel and some sections of grass"** (ohiogravelgrinders.com). On one route he noted **"at mile 13 I had turn back because the road was washed out over multiple sections and Jack warned me that alligators and snakes are abundant. I did not venture into the water"** (ohiogravelgrinders.com).

The course is described as having **"293 Feet of Elevation"** for the Long Course (54.7 miles) and **"192 Feet of Elevation"** for the Short Course (32.5 miles), indicating minimal climbing but technical sand/gravel challenges (trans-sylvaniaproductions.com).

From 2021 results, riders experienced **"dirt/gravel roads in red, and paved roads in black"** with the course starting on **"a short patch of paved roads, then after you get into the woods"** the gravel begins (granfondoguide.com).

## Weather Experienced

**Ray George [UNKNOWN]:** On his September 2019 rides reported **"Temps in upper 70's at start to mid 90's with high humidity"** for one 34-mile ride, and **"Temps in upper 60's at start to upper 90's with high humidity and no tree coverage"** for another 39-mile route (ohiogravelgrinders.com).

The 2021 race (June 12, 2021) had **"Overcast skies took some of the edge off the heat"** according to YouTube video description (youtube.com/watch?v=1qKtUAdRkhU).

The scheduled race date is typically late March (March 28, 2026 for the upcoming edition), suggesting cooler conditions than the summer reconnaissance rides (trans-sylvaniaproductions.com).

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**[UNKNOWN LEVEL]:** The 2025 Long Course (55 mi) was won in **2:28:16** by a group of four riders (Kyle Kayzar, Carter Harris, Keith Gerarden, Gabriel Anthony), indicating a pace of approximately 22.2 mph for the lead group (gravel-results.com).

The aid stations are positioned at **25 miles and 47 miles** for the Long Course, and **at 25 miles** for the Short Course, indicating strategic placement near the 2/3 point rather than mid-race (trans-sylvaniaproductions.com).

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

Mass start format with **"180 people mass start for all 3 distances. There were around 90 people entered in the 50-mile category"** noted in video description (youtube.com/watch?v=1qKtUAdRkhU).

The race is part of the **North Carolina Gravel Series** organized by Trans-Sylvania Productions, which also hosts the Uwharrie Forest Gravel Grinder (February) and Dirt Diggler Gravel Grinder (September) (granfondoguide.com).

Race day schedule includes **"7:15 AM -- Registration Opens, 8:30 AM -- Registration Closes, 8:45 AM -- Racer Meeting At Start, 9:00 AM -- RACE START, 11:00 AM -- Post Race Meal Begins"** with awards ceremonies at 11:30 AM (Short Course) and 12:00 PM (Long Course) (trans-sylvaniaproductions.com).

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**[UNKNOWN LEVEL]:** The course includes an **"E-Bike (Non-Competitive)"** category for both Long and Short courses, indicating the terrain is rideable on e-bikes but noting sand/gravel technical challenges (trans-sylvaniaproductions.com).

Given the **"loose sand roads"** and **"mushy sand"** terrain described, wider tires would be advantageous, though no specific tire recommendations were found in rider reports (trans-sylvaniaproductions.com, ohiogravelgrinders.com).
