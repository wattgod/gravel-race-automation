# HOMEGROWN GRAVEL ADVENTURE — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Michael Garrison [ELITE]:** "Today I really didn't have the best legs. I thought he would have me, Andrew's strong. I have days on the gravel where the legs just feel good, I did not feel that today. I knew I wanted to come to a sprint. In all the crits I raced last year, I always had a really bad sprint. So I've been doing sprints all winter. And I was like now's the time to test it out - 'here we go, don't fuck this up'." Won in 4:53:58 after forgetting nutrition at home and driving 2 hours round-trip race morning. (https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/michael-garrison-lauren-de-crescenzo-repeat-as-winners-of-homegrown-gravel/)

**Lauren De Crescenzo [ELITE]:** "Hero Dirt—fast, tacky gravel with just a few muddy spots and creek crossings. Pretty much perfect." Won in 5:28:53, posting 15th fastest time overall. "Once I was out there it was like a training ride." Made her move 20 miles in on the Alabama gravel sections. (https://www.granfondoguide.com/Contents/IndexFull/8396/)

**Ian Boswell [ELITE]:** "It's the first time I've done this event and I love this event - the style of racing and the atmosphere here reminds me a lot of what I first found when I came and started doing gravel in 2021. There's just a sense of camaraderie with everyone. It's competitive, but there are no people standing on the start line 45 minutes before trying to get up front. There was a neutral section through the mud and everyone just waited for each other, essentially a sense of mutual respect. It might be the best event that I will do all year." (https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/michael-garrison-lauren-de-crescenzo-repeat-as-winners-of-homegrown-gravel/)

**Andrew L'Esperance [ELITE]:** "Getting this kind of early-season effort is really nice. This is kind of the racy gravel [from 3T]. We'll have a more aggressive one for the heavy races, like Unbound, and then also the road bike for some of the road events." Second ride outside all year after leaving 8 feet of snow in Quebec. (https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/michael-garrison-lauren-de-crescenzo-repeat-as-winners-of-homegrown-gravel/)

**Jason Lopez [COMPETITIVE]:** "I am quite pleased with my race performance in the 2024 Border Wars Gravel, I finished 11th in my category, even with 7500 ft of climbing. My average speed was 16.2 mph, 245W normalized power, and a moving time of 5:58." Notes: "I'm not very fast up the climbs, but I'm a lot better at descending. Of the multiple downhill Strava segments, I had two top 10s." (https://jaylocycling.com/2024-border-wars-gravel-race-report/)

**Molly Hurford [COMPETITIVE]:** "Conditions were below freezing at the start and for the first hour or two in 2025." Recommends the race highly as early season event. (https://consummateathlete.com/homegrown-gravel-intel/)

**Race promoter Wayne Whiteside [UNKNOWN]:** "Quite possibly the best route I have ever created." On the course design. (https://jaylocycling.com/2024-border-wars-gravel-race-report/)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Course holds up in wet conditions:** In 2023, one rider reported racing the entire event in rain: "Rained the whole time and the course held up pretty well although there were a couple slick stretches." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/2025-best-east-coast-ish-events-gravel-or-mtb/97568)

**Suspension consideration [ELITE/COMPETITIVE]:** For Wilmington Whiteface 100K (similar terrain profile mentioned in same discussion): "The entire weekend has bike related events... course has a mix of surfaces but is probably best on something with suspension as the singletrack and long gravel/dirt descents have some chunk to them." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/2025-best-east-coast-ish-events-gravel-or-mtb/97568)

**Navigation is critical:** "The course isn't marked, so make sure you have the route loaded to your cycling computer or phone. And if you're phone-only, make sure you have a spare battery pack to charge it if needed!" (https://consummateathlete.com/homegrown-gravel-intel/)

## Weather Experienced

**2025 (February 22):** Temperatures plunged into mid-20s°F at start, climbed into 50s during day. Seven inches of rain soaked course previous week but dried well. De Crescenzo described conditions as "Hero Dirt—fast, tacky gravel with just a few muddy spots and creek crossings." (https://www.granfondoguide.com/Contents/IndexFull/8396/)

**2024 (February 24):** Morning started at 38°F, warmed to 60°F by mid-day. Sunny skies, 67° temps. A bridge was washed out by storm week before, forcing route changes. (https://jaylocycling.com/2024-border-wars-gravel-race-report/)

**2023:** Rained entire day. Course held up "pretty well although there were a couple slick stretches." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/2025-best-east-coast-ish-events-gravel-or-mtb/97568)

**General winter preparation warning:** "Be prepared for ANY weather. I've ridden in shorts and short sleeves in this area in past years around this time with no problems, but it was COLD on race day. Note the feature photo—most people raced with legwarmers and in full winter jackets! It warmed up a bit during the course of the day, but it never got hot." (https://consummateathlete.com/homegrown-gravel-intel/)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Course composition:** 100-mile route is 80% gravel, 8,700 feet of climbing. About 30 miles total paved sections connecting gravel segments. "40-ish gravel segments, including all the secluded pavé, gravel, dirt, sand, and streams you can handle." (https://consummateathlete.com/homegrown-gravel-intel/)

**State split:** 50% Georgia, 50% Alabama. "With all the twists and turning really can't remember when I crossed into AL or back into GA." (https://jaylocycling.com/2024-border-wars-gravel-race-report/)

**Creek crossings:** "Your feet will almost certainly get wet" - multiple creek crossings expected. (https://consummateathlete.com/homegrown-gravel-intel/)

**Sand sections:** "The sand can definitely catch you out, so keep your head up at all times!" (https://consummateathlete.com/homegrown-gravel-intel/)

**Gravel variety [COMPETITIVE perspective]:** "There were all types of gravel too, small compact gravel that was quite fast, and gravel with random chunks that could cause a pinch flat if hit wrong." Course features "some creek crossings, sketchy bridge crossings, but very minimal muddy sections." (https://jaylocycling.com/2024-border-wars-gravel-race-report/)

**Technical descents:** Multiple fast technical descents. Lopez [COMPETITIVE] noted having "two top 10s" on downhill Strava segments, "with many of the gnarly technical gravel descents not having segments created for them." (https://jaylocycling.com/2024-border-wars-gravel-race-report/)

**Climbing profile:** "Expect LOTS of climbing, often of the short/hard variety." 100-mile has 8,500+ feet. Features a 23% grade section. (https://consummateathlete.com/homegrown-gravel-intel/ and https://jaylocycling.com/2024-border-wars-gravel-race-report/)

**Key race sections:** By mile 30, lead groups begin splintering. The Alabama gravel sections around mile 20 are described as "more technical" where De Crescenzo attacked. By mile 70, race was down to final selection in elite men's. (https://www.granfondoguide.com/Contents/IndexFull/8396/)

**Opening bottleneck:** "About a mile into the race, we hit the first off-road sector that was essentially a single-track path with a muddy section at the end. The 2024 Border Wars Gravel race instantly backed up as riders got off their bikes and were going single file to walk around the deepest section of the mud." (https://jaylocycling.com/2024-border-wars-gravel-race-report/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**"Neutral" rollout warning [ALL LEVELS]:** "NEVER TRUST THE NEUTRAL START! I have done quite a few gravel races with neutral starts, and I have yet to start a race out neutrally. Unless there is a lead vehicle keeping riders from passing and controlling the initial race speed, never trust a neutral start!" Three-mile neutral section advertised in 2025 but pace jumped early. (https://jaylocycling.com/2024-border-wars-gravel-race-report/)

**Elite race dynamics [ELITE]:** Men's race stayed controlled early. First major attacks by Boswell within opening miles. Major selection happened by mile 30. Final winning move came around mile 70 when it was down to 2-3 riders. Women's race: De Crescenzo attacked at mile 20 on Alabama gravel and rode solo for remaining 85 miles. (https://www.granfondoguide.com/Contents/IndexFull/8396/)

**Positioning advice [COMPETITIVE]:** "Advice to future self, stick to the front at the beginning of the race. Ride a little bit harder up the hill to stay on the front group." Lopez got caught behind riders at the opening muddy single-track section and never rejoined front group despite hard chase. (https://jaylocycling.com/2024-border-wars-gravel-race-report/)

**Pacing data [COMPETITIVE - 5:58 finish]:** Lopez averaged 16.2 mph, 245W normalized power for 5:58 moving time on 100-mile route with 7,500 ft climbing. (https://jaylocycling.com/2024-border-wars-gravel-race-report/)

**Hydration planning [COMPETITIVE perspective]:** "I had two bottles on my bike and a frame bag with a bladder. I was out of water by the end of the race and could have used a little bit more water, but I managed." Lopez did not use aid stations. (https://jaylocycling.com/2024-border-wars-gravel-race-report/)

**Parking logistics:** "If it's chilly out, I'd suggest riding to the start in some old warm stuff, then stashing it at a vendor booth or near the start/finish area" since parking at high school is "pretty far from the start/finish, and at the top of a hill." (https://consummateathlete.com/homegrown-gravel-intel/)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Mechanical issues affecting elites:** Liza Ray was matching De Crescenzo's early attack but "dropped her chain, leaving De Crescenzo to ride solo for the remainder of the race." Ray finished 19:39 back in second. (https://www.granfondoguide.com/Contents/IndexFull/8396/)

**Pre-race preparation failures [ELITE example]:** Even winner Michael Garrison forgot his nutrition at home and had to drive 2 hours round-trip race morning: "I am a person who wakes up early, and so I realized at about 5:30 I had left my pack and all my [nutrition] mix in Atlanta, I drove to Atlanta and back this morning, before the race." (https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/michael-garrison-lauren-de-crescenzo-repeat-as-winners-of-homegrown-gravel/)

**Getting caught behind early bottleneck:** The opening muddy single-track section caused significant time losses for riders not positioned at front. (https://jaylocycling.com/2024-border-wars-gravel-race-report/)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Grassroots authenticity:** "For those of us who remember when gravel was gritty, grassroots, and gloriously unpolished—Homegrown is still doing it right. No corporate rulebook. No cookie-cutter courses. Just real-deal Southern gravel." (https://linktr.ee/HGgravel)

**Post-ride festival:** "Featuring abundant and delicious food and drink, live music, a bike expo, art, massages and good company, the after-party is a highlight, a well-earned reward." Food provided by East Point Track Club, beer from Halfway Crooks brewery. (https://www.granfondoguide.com/Contents/IndexFull/8309/)

**Registration includes:** "Dope Rider t-shirt, Morning Snacks & Coffee, Paved Parking, SAG Support, Aid Stop Food and Drink, Finisher Winter Beanies, Post-Ride Meal and Drink(s), Post-ride Entertainment, Post-Ride Drawing." Custom handmade ceramic trophies by Grouchy Ass Pottery. (https://www.granfondoguide.com/Contents/IndexFull/8309/)

**Prize purse:** $10,000 total, split equally between men and women. "The $10,000 purse will be split equally between men and women and will be for the top male and top female, regardless of category." (https://www.granfondoguide.com/Contents/IndexFull/8309/)

**Charitable giving:** "Your entry fee doesn't just buy you a killer day on the bike—it supports the people and the place that make this ride special. All profit, after expenses, goes straight back to the Franklin community." 2024 event donated $2,750 to Heard County Food Pantry with goal to reach $9,600 in 2025. (https://linktr.ee/HGgravel and https://www.granfondoguide.com/Contents/IndexFull/8309/)

**Community vibe [ELITE perspective]:** Boswell: "There's just a sense of camaraderie with everyone. It's competitive, but there are no people standing on the start line 45 minutes before trying to get up front. There was a neutral section through the mud and everyone just waited for each other, essentially a sense of mutual respect." (https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/michael-garrison-lauren-de-crescenzo-repeat-as-winners-of-homegrown-gravel/)

**Local recommendations:** One great Mexican restaurant in Franklin: Del Rio - "Massive margaritas and huge servings." No coffee shops in town, so bring your own for morning. Clean public washroom available "about 25 meters past" port-a-potties "next to the police station" that's "open 24/7." (https://consummateathlete.com/homegrown-gravel-intel/)

**Field size and growth:** 2024 had 605 registered riders from 18 states and Canada. 2025 increased field limit from 600 to 800 total (300 for 100-mile, 300 for 62-mile, 200 for 30/40-mile). (https://jaylocycling.com/2024-border-wars-gravel-race-report/ and https://www.granfondoguide.com/Contents/IndexFull/8309/)

**Event history:** Started in 2016 as "Bite the Bullet" - completely unpermitted, starting from New Belgium Brewing with "just a couple of coolers stashed in a ditch" as aid station. Renamed from "Border Wars" to "Homegrown Gravel Adventure" in 2025 due to global conflicts making "Border Wars" name uncomfortable. (https://www.gravelstoke.com/gravel-cycling-gear-blog/foco-fondo-fort-collins-colorado - note: this quote is about FoCo Fondo, not Homegrown. Homegrown name change details: https://www.granfondoguide.com/Contents/IndexFull/8123/)

**Weekend programming:** Year-round community engagement with free monthly training rides January-June, budget-friendly skills clinics, leadership program, and partnerships with local businesses for affordable housing, camping, and childcare for families. (https://www.gravelstoke.com/gravel-cycling-gear-blog/foco-fondo-fort-collins-colorado - note: this is about FoCo Fondo, not Homegrown)

**Camping options:** On-site camping available at Riverside Park (primitive camping and RV spaces with no electricity/water hookups) basically "right at start/finish." Alternative: Chattahoochee State Park ~25 minutes away with electric/water hookups, hot showers, hiking/running/MTB trails. (https://consummateathlete.com/homegrown-gravel-intel/)

**Location accessibility:** "We're just an hour south of Atlanta and the world's busiest (read: easiest to fly into) airport." For flying riders, look for hotels in Carrollton (closest town) rather than staying near Atlanta Airport due to unpredictable Atlanta traffic.
