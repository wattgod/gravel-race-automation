## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**From official description [UNKNOWN]:** "Situated on the NC/TN border, Hot Springs has one flat road along the French Broad River, everything else is climbing on some amazing scenic roads." (https://www.southeastgravel.com/hot-springs-gravel-gauntlet)

The course is characterized by constant elevation changes with "rolling short steep hills or moderate, sustained climbs." The only flat section is along the River Road by the French Broad River, which is pre-ridden during Friday's shakedown ride.

**From YouTube coverage [UNKNOWN]:** "Both the short and long courses were shorter than average for this series" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pEZYKAMt7A)
