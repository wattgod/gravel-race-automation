# HOUFFA GRAVEL — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Mads Würtz Schmidt [ELITE]:** "After about 25k we had a short technical and bumpy section where I went in first. Coming out of the section I looked back and saw a gap of 50-70 meters. Decided to put my head down and go for it. Back to the winning ways on the trails. I love The Ardennes in Belgium. So was thrilled to race here in Houffalize." (https://www.cyclingnews.com/races/uci-gravel-world-series-events-2025/houffa-gravel/results/)

**Ben Thomas [ELITE]:** "On Thursday morning I hopped in the Ribble team van as it rumbled down the M40 and by the evening we were rolling into Belgium after a Eurotunnel dash and plenty of me boring the team boss and Meth with my Ardennes stories. I'd insisted this event had to be on the calendar... After a very sweaty warm up on the rollers I stood on the start line at the base of the Côte du Saint Roch full of motivation and confidence... It takes 506 watts for just over 3 minutes to crest the 0.8km hill with an average gradient of 12.4%, but I'm in the lead group and the race is already in bits behind us." (https://www.benthomascoaching.com/post/houffa-gravel-full-gas-in-the-ardennes)

**Ben Thomas [ELITE]:** "The first lap was savage, I clung to the leaders until five of them edged away and soon I was swept up by group two, a twenty strong bunch who depressingly seemed more interested in racing for the top ten than chasing glory. I was frustrated as my legs felt so strong, my descending was on fire (the Ribble Ultra Grit with Rockshox Rudy fork and 55mm Schwalbe tyres was flying), and I wanted a shot at the podium. I found myself on the front of group two dragging riders around who were saving their legs for later." (https://www.benthomascoaching.com/post/houffa-gravel-full-gas-in-the-ardennes)

**Ben Thomas [ELITE]:** "By lap three all the people who'd saved their energy and still had fresh legs came to the front and whacked it on the front! The pace went nuclear. I had a normalized power of 344 watts for the first half of the third lap but it wasn't enough. I was paying for all the work I'd done in the first two laps... I focused on the power meter determined to keep the power over 300 watts whilst staying aero." (https://www.benthomascoaching.com/post/houffa-gravel-full-gas-in-the-ardennes)

**Ben Thomas [ELITE]:** "Houffa Gravel was once again an absolute classic. Steep climbs, gnarly trails, roaring crowds, frites, waffles, the full Ardennes experience. I didn't ride the smartest race but sometimes you have to roll the dice. This time it didn't work out, but the form is there, the motivation is sky high." (https://www.benthomascoaching.com/post/houffa-gravel-full-gas-in-the-ardennes)

**Race Director Jean-Luc Dupont [OFFICIAL]:** "This race highlights the incredible talent and spirit of gravel racing. With the European Championships on the horizon, we're excited to elevate this event and showcase Houffalize as a premier gravel destination."

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Ben Thomas [ELITE]:** Used Ribble Ultra Grit with Rockshox Rudy fork and 55mm Schwalbe tyres. Noted: "my descending was on fire (the Ribble Ultra Grit with Rockshox Rudy fork and 55mm Schwalbe tyres was flying)" (https://www.benthomascoaching.com/post/houffa-gravel-full-gas-in-the-ardennes)

**volsk19 [UNKNOWN]:** Asked about tire suitability: "I've got a Canyon CF 7 All-Road with Schwalbe G-One RS 35mm tires. Will I be ok with these tires, or do I need to swing by lbs? Bike is designed to accommodate 35mm tires. I have a spare set of the cheapest version of the SCHWALBE G-ONE ALLROUND, also 35 mm." No definitive answer provided in sources.

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Ben Thomas [ELITE]:** "It takes 506 watts for just over 3 minutes to crest the 0.8km hill with an average gradient of 12.4%" for the opening Côte du Saint Roch climb.

Finished 11th place. (https://www.benthomascoaching.com/post/houffa-gravel-full-gas-in-the-ardennes)

**Race Dynamics [ELITE level]:** "The first lap was savage... five of them edged away and soon I was swept up by group two, a twenty strong bunch who depressingly seemed more interested in racing for the top ten than chasing glory." - Ben Thomas [ELITE] Warning: working too hard early can leave you vulnerable when others attack fresh on lap 3. (https://www.benthomascoaching.com/post/houffa-gravel-full-gas-in-the-ardennes)

**Nutrition [ELITE]:** Ben Thomas [ELITE] used Precision Fuel & Hydration gels during the race: "One last Precision Fuel & Hydration gel, empty the energy drink from the bottles, every bit of energy was needed." (https://www.benthomascoaching.com/post/houffa-gravel-full-gas-in-the-ardennes)

**Elite Race Split Points [2025]:** The lead group of six broke away "early in the race" around 25km. Mads Würtz Schmidt then soloed from that group and won with a 3+ minute margin (4:21:45 vs 4:24:57). (https://www.cyclingnews.com/races/uci-gravel-world-series-events-2025/houffa-gravel/results/)

**Women's Race Dynamics [ELITE, 2025]:** "Esmee Peperkamp opening strong to pass solo at the finish line after one lap.

## DNF Risk Factors

**Mechanical Issues [ELITE, 2024]:** Sebastian Schönberger (winner) "faced mechanical problems" during the race but was able to chase back and catch the leader in the closing kilometres. (https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/houffa-gravel-romy-kasper-sebastian-schonberger-take-top-steps-at-uci-world-series-round-in-belgium/)

**Technical Descents:** Ben Thomas [ELITE] noted needing to "stay safe as we lapped some of the age group competitors" on technical tracks in the final lap. The 2025 redesign featured "fewer technical downhills" than 2024, suggesting previous years had challenging/dangerous descent sections.

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Ben Thomas [ELITE]:** "For over ten years I've been making trips to the Ardennes to race bikes, first MTB World Cups, then marathons and stage races, and now gravel races. Somehow the excitement never fades. This past weekend lining up for Houffa Gravel I felt the same buzz I did before my very first Belgian race. Maybe it's the legendary climbs, maybe it's the waffles, maybe both." (https://www.benthomascoaching.com/post/houffa-gravel-full-gas-in-the-ardennes)
