## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Kaitlyn Patterson [ELITE]:** "Last year I took fifth at Iceman, making it all the way to Timber Ridge with the leaders but had nothing left after pulling way too much throughout the race. This year I knew what to expect and I had every intention of racing for the win." (https://www.athleticmentors.com/how-it-all-went-down-an-iceman-cometh-race-recap/)

**Kaitlyn Patterson [ELITE]:** "Less than ten minutes in, another rider merged right into me trying to jump into another line without looking behind her. I thought my race was over at that moment, but I somehow managed to stay upright. However, her and a couple riders behind us were not so lucky and this ended up to be one of the first decisive splits." (https://www.athleticmentors.com/how-it-all-went-down-an-iceman-cometh-race-recap/)

**Kaitlyn Patterson [ELITE]:** "I bobbled and dropped my bottle hand-off and with temperatures in the mid-60s, I really needed it. I refused to let my race be ruined and was resolved to get a bottle from someone... a guy was watching alone on the VASA during a slower climbing section and graciously gave me his bottle (thank you, mystery man!)" (https://www.athleticmentors.com/how-it-all-went-down-an-iceman-cometh-race-recap/)

**Kaitlyn Patterson [ELITE]:** "I carried a bit more momentum over the previous descent to slingshot around and rode as hard as I could and didn't look back. (According to Strava, I clocked the 5th fastest time of the day up that climb including all the men)." (https://www.athleticmentors.com/how-it-all-went-down-an-iceman-cometh-race-recap/)

**Kaitlyn Patterson [ELITE]:** "I crashed on one of the loose gravel corners (falling in the stadium in front of everyone is everyone's fear) but thankfully it was only flesh wounds and I had enough of a gap that I didn't lose a spot." (https://www.athleticmentors.com/how-it-all-went-down-an-iceman-cometh-race-recap/)

**John Arias [COMPETITIVE]:** "Since close to 1900 riders had started in 27 waves in front of mine it was going to be a day of passing. The course was incredibly fast with all double track and singletrack which made for safe and fairly quick passing. The major slow downs took place in the singletrack where hundreds of riders were getting jammed up all together in a long line of wheel to wheel bicycles as far as I could see." (https://scottrcmtb.blogspot.com/2010/11/2010-iceman-cometh-race-report.html)

**John Arias [COMPETITIVE]:** "As the race progressed the ground softened up and exposed the normal Michigan riding conditions which consists almost exclusively of sand." (https://scottrcmtb.blogspot.com/2010/11/2010-iceman-cometh-race-report.html)

**Paige (last name not given) [ELITE]:** "I found myself getting very mentally frustrated. It's frustrating to have the strength but not the skills. It's frustrating to race in a way that isn't efficient - just powering my way through as much as I can without the skills. That power has allowed me to climb to this level, something I'm usually proud of and thankful for. But today all I wanted was more skill." (https://www.paigepowered.com/post/iceman-cometh-race-recap)

**Paige [ELITE]:** "As I entered the final stretch of the new single track before Icebreaker hill I dreaded this section as it was really slippery and tight. The crowds were yelling and for full transparency I felt really uncomfortable here. I thought, 'oh great my crappy trail skills are on full display here, how the hell am I a pro rider?'" (https://www.paigepowered.com/post/iceman-cometh-race-recap)

**Gerald Gaecke (NMMBA Ambassador) [UNKNOWN]:** "Racing, for me, is the only way I can truly push myself to the limits. Training with friends is great, and we push each other hard, but it's never quite as intense as when I'm being challenged in a race." (https://blog.iceman.com/index.php/tag/race/)

**Kedzie Ruckle (Junior racer) [COMPETITIVE]:** "This year's Iceman felt like the first time everything really clicked for me. From the moment I rolled into the start chute, I could tell the training I put in all season with MISCA Devo and my coach, Sara Vano, had paid off." (https://blog.iceman.com/)

**Kedzie Ruckle [COMPETITIVE]:** "Riding with a group that's moving the same pace as you gives you energy you can't really explain until you're in it: the drafting, the shared effort, the subtle communication, and that unspoken agreement that we're all pulling each other forward. It felt like real racing." (https://blog.iceman.com/)

**Kedzie Ruckle [COMPETITIVE]:** "There were sections where the line was completely stopped, and honestly, there were moments where I'm pretty sure I could've carried my bike through the woods faster than waiting out some of those jams." (https://blog.iceman.com/)

**Anonymous Trailblazer [COMPETITIVE]:** "Around May, I went in for my annual check-up and was put on a new medication. By July, I had a significant reaction to it and lost over 60 lbs... My FTP dropped from 280 to 215. I couldn't finish a regular ride without bonking." (https://blog.iceman.com/)

**Anonymous Trailblazer [COMPETITIVE]:** "Sow's Ear wasn't nearly as bad as the comments made it out to be. It felt like riding moguls, but it was completely rideable, just something to get through." (https://blog.iceman.com/)

**Anonymous Trailblazer [COMPETITIVE]:** "I reached Dockery just after 37 minutes. I figured I could make up that time if I got some luck, but luck wasn't on anyone's side in the later waves." (https://blog.iceman.com/)

**Anonymous Trailblazer [COMPETITIVE]:** "As we approached the new Gussied Up section, I felt incredible. The best singletrack ride I've ever had. Legs felt strong, confidence was high. Then we slowed down… and stopped. No crash, no help needed, just a long bottleneck." (https://blog.iceman.com/)

**crabwhisperer [UNKNOWN]:** "It was a very fast, twisting part with blind corners and suddenly I heard voices yelling very loudly up ahead through the bushes. I hit the brakes, came around the corner to see a racer laying motionless on the ground... And there were no less than 10 riders that pulled off the trail to check on the person, yell ahead warning, and physically protect them from being run over." (https://www.reddit.com/r/MichiganCycling/comments/1gjcmlp/humanity_at_the_iceman_cometh_race/)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Geoff Kabush [ELITE]:** Won Iceman on a gravel bike setup: "27.5 x 2.1" tires and a 2x, Shimano Dura-Ace Di2 Hydro drivetrain on his very limited edition Yeti Turq / Open Cycles U.P. frame." (https://cyclingmagazine.ca/mtb/kabush-wins-iceman-cometh-on-his-open-gravel-bike/)

**Paige [ELITE]:** "Maxxis Race Rekon 2.4's (16/17psi)" running tubeless. Also noted: "I just chopped my bars down a little bit for the tight section at the end." (https://www.paigepowered.com/post/iceman-cometh-race-recap)

**John Arias [COMPETITIVE]:** "I was totally stoked to have Pro Gold lubricants on my drivetrain. Pro Gold kept my Scott 29er running smooth and fast for the entire race" despite sand conditions. (https://scottrcmtb.blogspot.com/2010/11/2010-iceman-cometh-race-report.html)

**John Arias [COMPETITIVE]:** "I added 3 sets of toe warmers to my riding shoes which made for a bit of a tight fit but fairly warm toes" for freezing conditions. (https://scottrcmtb.blogspot.com/2010/11/2010-iceman-cometh-race-report.html)

**Anonymous Trailblazer [COMPETITIVE]:** Used weighted water bottles for training: "I started filling old water bottles with drywall plaster to add weight to the bike for climbing strength. Am I nuts? Absolutely. But desperate times call for desperate measures." (https://blog.iceman.com/)

**Dewthedru [UNKNOWN]:** Asked about tire recommendations for riding Iceman on a gravel bike (Checkpoint), mentioning "stock Bontrager GR1 set" as a possibility. (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/16l5qjv/need_tire_advice_best_option_for_iceman_cometh/)

## Weather Experienced

**2010:** "The snow began on the Friday drive up to Traverse City. The temperature had dropped to just about freezing and then got below 32 overnight. I awoke to frozen earth, cold temps, and a clear sun filled sky." (https://scottrcmtb.blogspot.com/2010/11/2010-iceman-cometh-race-report.html)

**2016 (Kaitlyn Patterson's race):** "Temperatures in the mid-60s" - unusually warm, creating significant hydration needs. (https://www.athleticmentors.com/how-it-all-went-down-an-iceman-cometh-race-recap/)

**2019:** Course conditions described as "unexpectedly brutal" and "brutal mud" based on podcast description. (https://komcycling.com/blogs/product-blogs/dirty-chain-podcast-episode-12-more-iceman-because-why-not)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Course Evolution - Tom White (NMMBA) [UNKNOWN]:** "Thirty years ago the forest between Kalkaska and Timber Ridge was a seldom used network of leaf covered logging roads with some classic Northern Michigan sand traps along the way. Today, we are sharing the woods with so many other users." (https://blog.iceman.com/index.php/tag/race/)

**Sand Conditions:** "The normal Michigan riding conditions which consists almost exclusively of sand." (https://scottrcmtb.blogspot.com/2010/11/2010-iceman-cometh-race-report.html)

**Key Climbs - Named Sections:**
- "Make it Stick" - described as "a steep multi-tiered climb" (https://www.athleticmentors.com/how-it-all-went-down-an-iceman-cometh-race-recap/)
- "The Boonenberg" - "one of the longer climbs on the VASA about six miles from the finish" (https://www.athleticmentors.com/how-it-all-went-down-an-iceman-cometh-race-recap/)
- "Anita's Hill" - where crowds start to build significantly (https://www.athleticmentors.com/how-it-all-went-down-an-iceman-cometh-race-recap/)
- "Woodchip Hill" - approximately 1 mile from finish (https://www.athleticmentors.com/how-it-all-went-down-an-iceman-cometh-race-recap/)
- "Icebreaker Hill" - final climb before finish (https://www.athleticmentors.com/how-it-all-went-down-an-iceman-cometh-race-recap/)

**2023 Course Updates - Tom White (NMMBA) [UNKNOWN]:** "The single track pieces in this section are mostly flat to down hill and should allow racers to flow and even take advantage of a little recovery. It should be noted that no single track was added simply for the thrill of it. Every piece of single track eliminates hub deep sand sections that are no fun for anyone." (https://blog.iceman.com/index.php/tag/race/)

**Specific Sections Added (2023):**
- "Uncle Tom's Cabin" - downhill berms
- "Time Saver Two Track" - "a sand-free two track with a mild hump and drop off"
- "Time Sucker Single Track" - "100% flat and full of turns as it routes racers around a nearly impassible section of sandy gas line trail"
- "Step Sister" - "only half the length of a football field, but infinitely better than pushing a bicycle"
- "Sow's Ear" - described by rider as "riding moguls" (https://blog.iceman.com/)
- "Gussied Up" - caused major bottlenecks in later waves (https://blog.iceman.com/)

**Course Distance:** "29.3 miles with 1700ft climbing" (https://www.paigepowered.com/post/iceman-cometh-race-recap)

**Technical Sections:** Paige [ELITE] noted the finish area: "new single track before Icebreaker hill... was really slippery and tight. The crowds were yelling and for full transparency I felt really uncomfortable here." (https://www.paigepowered.com/post/iceman-cometh-race-recap)

**Timber Ridge Finish:** Kaitlyn Patterson [ELITE] noted: "I switched to damage control mode to try and not make mistakes on the single track in Timber Ridge with everyone watching." (https://www.athleticmentors.com/how-it-all-went-down-an-iceman-cometh-race-recap/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Kaitlyn Patterson [ELITE]:** Identified "The Boonenberg" climb about 6 miles from finish as her attack point: "I had picked out as a potential spot to attack. The whole thing felt a bit surreal but I knew I had to at least give it my best shot. I carried a bit more momentum over the previous descent to slingshot around and rode as hard as I could and didn't look back." (https://www.athleticmentors.com/how-it-all-went-down-an-iceman-cometh-race-recap/)

**Kaitlyn Patterson [ELITE]:** "My mission for the first half was to be patient and stay out of trouble." Early race patience paid off for eventual 2nd place finish. (https://www.athleticmentors.com/how-it-all-went-down-an-iceman-cometh-race-recap/)

**Kaitlyn Patterson [ELITE]:** Position management: "I calmed down near the end of the line and closed the gaps that would open between riders after each single track section due to both accordion effect and talent differential (the mountain bike pros are basically ninjas)." (https://www.athleticmentors.com/how-it-all-went-down-an-iceman-cometh-race-recap/)

**Anonymous Trailblazer [COMPETITIVE]:** Set specific time goals: "12.5 mph avg, Dockery by 36:00, Williamsburg by 1:36. If I can stick to that, I'd have a shot at sub-2:30." (https://blog.iceman.com/)

**Anonymous Trailblazer [COMPETITIVE]:** Start strategy: "When we took off, I sprinted hard to catch up with a group. Facing that headwind, I didn't care about burning a match or hitting a PR – I needed a draft." (https://blog.iceman.com/)

**Paige [ELITE]:** Nutrition for shorter race: "Solely liquid calories and carbs with a shorter race, used Flow Formula 90g per bottle" for 1:43:50 finish time. (https://www.paigepowered.com/post/iceman-cometh-race-recap)

**Gerald Gaecke [UNKNOWN]:** Training evolution: "Initially, I would just ride the race route and memorize it, not paying much attention to specific challenges. Then I realized the need to diversify my training. For an eight-mile single-track race, I'd ride the route a few times to build endurance. Soon, I started incorporating gravel rides, gradually increasing the distance to three or four times the race length." (https://blog.iceman.com/index.php/tag/race/)

**Kedzie Ruckle [COMPETITIVE]:** Wave strategy: "Riding with a group that's moving the same pace as you gives you energy you can't really explain until you're in it: the drafting, the shared effort, the subtle communication, and that unspoken agreement that we're all pulling each other forward." (https://blog.iceman.com/)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Mechanical Issues:** "Erin caught us but she dropped her chain again up the next steep climb. I felt bad for her because she was riding really well but her chain dropped nearly every climb forcing her off her bike." - Kaitlyn Patterson [ELITE] describing a competitor's race-ending mechanical. (https://www.athleticmentors.com/how-it-all-went-down-an-iceman-cometh-race-recap/)

**Early Crashes:** Multiple riders crashed less than 10 minutes into the race when "another rider merged right into me trying to jump into another line without looking behind her... Her and a couple riders behind us were not so lucky and this ended up to be one of the first decisive splits." (https://www.athleticmentors.com/how-it-all-went-down-an-iceman-cometh-race-recap/)

**Dropped Bottle at Critical Moment:** Kaitlyn Patterson [ELITE] nearly had race compromised: "I bobbled and dropped my bottle hand-off and with temperatures in the mid-60s, I really needed it" - required getting bottle from spectator to continue. (https://www.athleticmentors.com/how-it-all-went-down-an-iceman-cometh-race-recap/)

**Crashes in Finish Area:** "I crashed on one of the loose gravel corners (falling in the stadium in front of everyone is everyone's fear)" - Kaitlyn Patterson [ELITE]. (https://www.athleticmentors.com/how-it-all-went-down-an-iceman-cometh-race-recap/)

**Injury on Course:** "I came around the corner to see a racer laying motionless on the ground. Oh man it looked kinda bad... somewhere in front of Wave 17, maybe around mile 7 or 8. It was a very fast, twisting part with blind corners." (https://www.reddit.com/r/MichiganCycling/comments/1gjcmlp/humanity_at_the_iceman_cometh_race/)

**Skills vs. Strength:** Paige [ELITE] noted technical sections as limiting factor: "It's frustrating to have the strength but not the skills. It's frustrating to race in a way that isn't efficient - just powering my way through as much as I can without the skills." Lost contact with lead group on technical singletrack. (https://www.paigepowered.com/post/iceman-cometh-race-recap)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Kaitlyn Patterson [ELITE]:** "The next hour was a bit of a blur of interviews and hugs and I basically felt like a rock star... The crowd was absolutely insane and I felt like I was racing in Europe." (https://www.athleticmentors.com/how-it-all-went-down-an-iceman-cometh-race-recap/)

**Kaitlyn Patterson [ELITE]:** "Traverse City truly has an incredible cycling community, puts on a world class race, and has a lot of fun doing it." (https://www.athleticmentors.com/how-it-all-went-down-an-iceman-cometh-race-recap/)

**Catharine Pendrel [ELITE] (World Champion):** Gave kudos to Kaitlyn Patterson for a "perfectly timed attack." Patterson noted: "Hearing that compliment from a previous World Champion totally made my day. Chloe was also extremely complimentary." (https://www.athleticmentors.com/how-it-all-went-down-an-iceman-cometh-race-recap/)

**Paige [ELITE]:** "The people got me through the last 5K of that course and I remain thankful for this race experience because of the community... As I entered the final stretch of the new single track before Icebreaker hill I dreaded this section... The crowds were yelling and for full transparency I felt really uncomfortable here. I thought, 'oh great my crappy trail skills are on full display here, how the hell am I a pro rider?' But despite my insecurities at this moment, as I exited the trail in one piece, I just didn't care what anyone thought of me." (https://www.paigepowered.com/post/iceman-cometh-race-recap)

**Kedzie Ruckle [COMPETITIVE]:** "The community this year felt unmatched; everywhere I looked, someone was cheering, encouraging, or suffering right alongside me. Iceman is always known for its community, but this year felt on a whole different level." (https://blog.iceman.com/)

**Anonymous Trailblazer [COMPETITIVE]:** "Spending time with my wife and kid kept me grounded. The Iceman group text, where everyone was buzzing with last-minute prep, was the final touch of a year-long buildup." (https://blog.iceman.com/)

**Community Support During Crisis:** "There were no less than 10 riders that pulled off the trail to check on the person, yell ahead warning, and physically protect them from being run over... it just really hit me how cool it was for those people to stop like that. People who trained all summer for this race, some of them maybe overcoming injuries or using this race to get over personal challenges in their life. But in that moment their placing or time meant nothing because someone needed help." (https://www.reddit.com/r/MichiganCycling/comments/1gjcmlp/humanity_at_the_iceman_cometh_race/)

**John Arias [COMPETITIVE]:** "In the spirit of the event no one was complaining only enjoying!" despite massive traffic jams from 1900+ riders ahead. (https://scottrcmtb.blogspot.com/2010/11/2010-iceman-cometh-race-report.html)

**Scale:** "This year over 4000 riders tackled the route from Kalkasa to Traverse City." (https://cyclingmagazine.ca/mtb/kabush-wins-iceman-cometh-on-his-open-gravel-bike/)

**Event Legacy:** Tom White (NMMBA) [UNKNOWN]: "The Northern Michigan Mountain Bike Association is honored to be partnered with the absolutely fantastic Iceman group of volunteers, the Michigan DNR, the racers, event sponsors and the Cherry Festival Foundation... It must also be noted the entire race from Kalkaska to TC travels entirely on public/state land. This is the only way this race could exist." (https://blog.iceman.com/index.php/tag/race/)

**Expo and Pre-Race:** Anonymous Trailblazer [COMPETITIVE]: "The expo is always a highlight, and watching the Bonk Bros do a live podcast was pretty cool. Hearing them talk about the race eased my nerves." (https://blog.iceman.com/)

**Family Aspect:** McKenna and her dad Jeff rode together for the first time, featured in "heartfelt mini-interview" on podcast. (https://komcycling.com/blogs/product-blogs/dirty-chain-podcast-episode-12-more-iceman-because-why-not)

**Mixed Ability Field:** John Arias [COMPETITIVE] on unseeded starts: "Since this was my first time racing Iceman and the promoters dropped racing class as a definition for starting order, I was in the 28th start wave. The 28th wave was an 'unseeded' start wave which included only riders who had not raced Iceman in previous years." (https://scottrcmtb.blogspot.com/2010/11/2010-iceman-cometh-race-report.html)
