# IOWA STATE GRAVEL TT CHAMPIONSHIP — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Rick Hopson [ELITE]:** "The IC-Amana-IC loop, a 70-ish mile chip, gravel, B-road, mud, and water-soaked route from IC to Amana, with a stop at the Millstream Brewery, and then back. The out leg was brutal but the return leg was worse, the latter usually being a full-gas, beer-clouded, anerobic paceline from hell. Most of my favorite training moments are from this ride… attacked by mosquitoes while reassembling Mez's bike, dog chases, shattered collarbones, head-to-post encouters (thanks bR!), bits of lip floating in my beer after crashing over Lobster, frostbite, biking through miles of open water (and seeing Fritz Viner sink beneath the surface on his 50th birthday ride), the discovery of the Nokian studded CX tire after a bloody encounter with ice, and lost rear dr's too numerous to count."

**Rick Hopson [ELITE]:** "Caution is in order here… the bridge is guarded by 25 yards of mud on the approach, 75 yards of mud on the other side, and a 12" concrete ledge on both ends. The bridge itself is usually ok, but remnants of burned sofas, Falstaff beer cans, and old camp fires are present and best avoided."

**Rick Hopson [ELITE]:** "A visit to WeatherUnderground might be in order, but regardless, only Lobster will be sporting road shoes for this event if it has rained in the past week." (https://iowacitycyclingclub.com/events/iowa-state-grave-time-trial-championships/ia-state-gravel-tt-2017/)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**The Abandoned Bridge:** "This is the first of the Three Challenges: the Abandoned Bridge, a lost and ancient iron span that somehow remains on this gravel road from an old route over the Iowa River, now impassable to all but wildlife and the hunters that pursue them. Caution is in order here… the bridge is guarded by 25 yards of mud on the approach, 75 yards of mud on the other side, and a 12" concrete ledge on both ends." (https://iowacitycyclingclub.com/events/iowa-state-grave-time-trial-championships/ia-state-gravel-tt-2017/)

**The R.A.U.S. (River And Unrideable Sand):** "challenge #2: The R.A.U.S. (river and unrideable sand), a series of sand dunes and water crossings that might require a bike hoist (or two)." The description notes there may be a photographer at this section. (https://iowacitycyclingclub.com/events/iowa-state-grave-time-trial-championships/ia-state-gravel-tt-2017/)

**Water Crossings:** "A sharp left turn will lead you to a final water crossing that has an average depth of 1-2 feet… usually rideable, but as has been proven many times, not always." (https://iowacitycyclingclub.com/events/iowa-state-grave-time-trial-championships/ia-state-gravel-tt-2017/)

**The False Flat B Finish:** "The last 1.3 miles are on a dirt/mud surface whose countenance is a bit difficult to predict, but is influence greatly by the rain it has seen in the preceding 2 days. The best I have seen is smooth and hard packed dirt: a rocket B. The worse is one of a deeply rutted and completely unridable goo that makes even walking a challenge." (https://iowacitycyclingclub.com/events/iowa-state-grave-time-trial-championships/ia-state-gravel-tt-2017/)

**Course Layout:** Total distance approximately 21.5-28 miles (sources vary). First 1.5 miles heading east is paved, then transitions to gravel after crossing railroad tracks near East Amana. Flat for 2 miles before hitting "a gentle rise followed by a distinct climb. This hill is the first of 3, all of which are big ring-able, but all attention-getting." (https://iowacitycyclingclub.com/events/iowa-state-grave-time-trial-championships/ia-state-gravel-tt-2017/)

**Minimum Maintenance Roads:** "You are now heading west and onto a winding network of course gravel/stone roads that loop around the river bottom area for about 6 miles. This is a desolate area, not on most maps, with unnamed roads, and is subject to very limited maintenance. The gravel is sometimes a bit large and the tarmac a bit choppy."

**Historical Context:** The race was designed to share a legendary local training route with a broader audience, rooted in the Iowa City cycling community's tradition of "trying all that was difficult and painful on a bike." The route has significant history among local riders dating back many years. (https://iowacitycyclingclub.com/events/iowa-state-grave-time-trial-championships/ia-state-gravel-tt-2017/)
