# IOWA WIND AND ROCK — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Cory Rood [COMPETITIVE]:** "After the first 80 miles I only managed to build a 44 minute cushion. I had no idea why my light wasn't working or what I was going to do. I was above my pacing target. I didn't feel as good as I thought I should. It felt like very little was going well enough to finish. It was way too early in the race to be in this dark of a place." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/a-success-story-iowa-wind-and-rock/57591)

**Cory Rood [COMPETITIVE]:** "Beth was informed this year to not be so willing to come and pick me up. She was instructed that either my bike was to be broken, or I was questioning if I should be calling her or 911 before she would agree to come and pick me up. I wasn't quitting until either I finished or was told to quit." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/a-success-story-iowa-wind-and-rock/57591)

**Mathew Wollmann [COMPETITIVE]:** "At some point I just couldn't hold JR's pace, and he rode off into the night around 9:30 - 10:00 PM. I was alone... As I progressed I started to shiver quite a bit as the temps dipped. I stopped in the middle of nowhere and put on my final layers, switched out my toe warmers, and got ready for a long night. Temperatures dipped again in the lower 20's." (https://www.mathewwollmann.com/post/iowa-wind-rock-2023-race-recap)

**Mathew Wollmann [COMPETITIVE]:** "My pace suffered, and I was averaging about 8 mph. But I was moving. At one point I started hallucinating seeing tree canopies over me, and multiple times waking up while riding the bike. On two separate occasions, I woke up with my bike almost in the ditch. It wasn't looking good." (https://www.mathewwollmann.com/post/iowa-wind-rock-2023-race-recap)

**Sarah Cooper (Race Director) [UNKNOWN]:** "Then out of nowhere around 2:30 - 3:00 AM, I saw a truck, and Sarah Cooper hop out. She was checking on her flock. I stopped and shared my concerns about sleep deprivation. I just couldn't stop to sleep in the ditch like a summer race because I literally could have frozen. Staying moving was my only option. Sarah said, 'Well wake up,' and with both hands hit the side of my cheeks." (https://www.mathewwollmann.com/post/iowa-wind-rock-2023-race-recap)

**Wilco [RECREATIONAL]:** "It felt like there were maybe 5 or 6 satisfying rollers in the whole race, where you could get out of your saddle and carry momentum up and over anything... Other distinctives of IWAR: It's remote! We never passed a single gas station (or any other business) the entire route other than our pre-planned 3 stops." (https://wilcounchained.substack.com/p/iowa-wind-and-rock-iwar-2024)

**Wilco [RECREATIONAL]:** "I was pedaling hard into the wind when, suddenly, a rock kicked up and jammed in my derailleur. Before I could stop pedaling, I heard the sickening sound of metal ripped from metal. My rear wheel locked up in a split second as the derailleur fell into the spokes, and I came skidding to a stop... My race was over at mile 192." (https://wilcounchained.substack.com/p/iowa-wind-and-rock-iwar-2024)

**Greg Grandgeorge [ELITE]:** "The biggest lesson for me was the impact of mental fatigue in this race. The combination of staying on top of written cue sheets (manual navigation by mileage) and nearly constant required focus of picking lines through the fresh gravel took a significant mental toll over the course of the race. Interestingly, there's a lot of the course I simply don't remember… Janie and Heather had similar experiences." (https://ggtri.wordpress.com/test-2/2019-races/2019-iowa-wind-and-rock-iawar/)

**Greg Grandgeorge [ELITE]:** "I was chatting with Steve Fuller prior to the race about all the crap I was carrying, and he said it sounded like I had 'bags full of fears'… which was spot on. I had traded weight for lower risk, and I was okay with it given my DNF history." (https://ggtri.wordpress.com/test-2/2019-races/2019-iowa-wind-and-rock-iawar/)

**John Jarvis [COMPETITIVE]:** "I was pedaling hard into the wind when, suddenly, a rock kicked up and jammed in my derailleur. Before I could stop pedaling, I heard the sickening sound of metal ripped from metal... The mangled derailleur was tangled up in the spokes. The chain was wrapped around the axle and bent in multiple places; there was no way to shorten it to kluge together a single speed... My race was over at mile 192." (https://www.eplocalnews.org/2022/05/05/gravel-racing-a-challenge-for-body-and-mind/)

**John Jarvis [COMPETITIVE]:** "After all, I'm 67 years old; I'm beyond lucky to have the circumstances and health to ride a bike at this level, let alone to ride in the presence of all of these superb athletes." (https://www.eplocalnews.org/2022/05/05/gravel-racing-a-challenge-for-body-and-mind/)

**Sarah Cooper (Race Director) [UNKNOWN]:** "The extreme winter we had here in Iowa devastated the surface of our roads, and even though things were very dry for race day, the impact of that damage was evident all over the course. Spring means new rock, which showed up by the truckload just in time. It all made for a very, very difficult day." (https://www.cxmagazine.com/2019-iowa-wind-rock-gravel-race-ultra-endurance-transiowa-legacy)

**Sarah Cooper (Race Director) [UNKNOWN]:** "The Trail of Tears was a road that I took out to see the tree in the road, because why not ride 70 miles into a 30mph headwind on fresh rock to see a tree? The tailwind on fresh rock on the way home from that ride taught me a lot, and I take myself there whenever I need a good ass kicking. No one has shed more tears on that road than myself. I love this route." (https://www.cxmagazine.com/2019-iowa-wind-rock-gravel-race-ultra-endurance-transiowa-legacy)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Generator Hub Lighting Issues [COMPETITIVE]:** Cory Rood experienced a complete failure of his generator hub and light system in the first few minutes of the race at 4am. He had to rely on a rechargeable battery-powered headlight with ~6 hours of battery life for the first daylight segment, creating extreme stress about the overnight navigation. The system mysteriously started working again later in the race. (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/a-success-story-iowa-wind-and-rock/57591)

**Toe Warmers Essential [COMPETITIVE]:** Mathew Wollmann noted his feet were the only cold part in early miles. At Checkpoint 1, he added toe warmers between layers of booties which "worked great." Later restocked at Casey's buying "a bunch of toe/hand warmers." (https://www.mathewwollmann.com/post/iowa-wind-rock-2023-race-recap)

**Rim Brakes Vulnerability [RECREATIONAL]:** Wilco was "one of only two people in this entire race still racing rim brakes" and suffered a broken spoke around mile 170 that caused severe rim bend. Had to completely disengage rear brakes for final 170+ miles, making steep descents nerve-wracking with front brake only. (https://wilcounchained.substack.com/p/iowa-wind-and-rock-iwar-2024)

**650b Wheel Choice [ELITE]:** Greg Grandgeorge opted for "my 650b wheelset with 47mm tires as they gave me a little more float and less vibration" in the fresh gravel conditions. His race bike weighed 18lbs before loading approximately 16lbs of gear and water. (https://ggtri.wordpress.com/test-2/2019-races/2019-iowa-wind-and-rock-iawar/)

**Comprehensive Gear Loadout [ELITE]:** Greg Grandgeorge carried full rain suit, two sets arm warmers, two sets leg warmers, wind vest, two pairs gloves, waterproof mittens, waterproof shoe covers, two spare tubes, tire boots, plugs, patches, spoke repair kit, multi-tool, Leatherman, Di2 tool, spare RD hanger, spare chain links, Connex links, wire, zip ties, chain lube, and pepper spray for dogs. Total bike weight: 34lbs with bottles filled (18lb bike + ~16lbs gear/water, not including 3L Camelbak). (https://ggtri.wordpress.com/test-2/2019-races/2019-iowa-wind-and-rock-iawar/)

**Aero Optimizations [COMPETITIVE]:** John Jarvis wore "tightest clothing, nothing flapping. I wore a helmet cover to close off the watt-sucking ventilation holes. My tires were carefully selected for minimal rolling resistance and air drag." (https://www.eplocalnews.org/2022/05/05/gravel-racing-a-challenge-for-body-and-mind/)

**Fig Bars as Insulation [COMPETITIVE]:** Mathew Wollmann wrapped approximately 15 Fig bars around his thighs, noting "I was made fun of" but "turns out they worked great for nutrition AND another layer blocking the wind!" (https://www.mathewwollmann.com/post/iowa-wind-rock-2023-race-recap)

**Emergency Light Solution [RECREATIONAL]:** When Wilco's generator hub failed, he "purchased a $4 flashlight to try and somehow get myself through the overnight. I had no idea how this was going to work, but I at least had another light source!" (https://wilcounchained.substack.com/p/iowa-wind-and-rock-iwar-2024)

## Weather Experienced

**2021 Race:** Mid-April. Low temps in low 40's, highs in high 50's with N-NW winds 10-20mph. Ground was wet from overnight rain but no active precipitation. Weather was described as "nothing to be too concerned with, a pretty good forecast by all measures." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/a-success-story-iowa-wind-and-rock/57591)

**2023 Race:** April 22-23. Start at 4am with feel-like temps in the 20's. Peak wind gusts nearing 30 mph with sustained near 20 mph entire first day. Sleet in riders' faces during daylight hours. Overnight temps dipped to lower 20's. One rider noted "I actually preferred this" regarding the wind dying to 6mph overnight because it kept him from overheating in all his layers. (https://www.mathewwollmann.com/post/iowa-wind-rock-2023-race-recap)

**2022 Race:** April 23-24. Forecast called for 25-30 mph winds with 50 mph gusts and thunderstorms all day, which caused many riders to skip the race (field was 53 vs normal 125 cap). Wind was "already howling" at 4am start. Around sunset at mile 170, "tornadic thunderstorms" rolled through forcing riders to shelter in a barn for hours. After storm passed around 12:30am, "the stiff wind had shifted and was now out of the northwest – just the direction we were heading." (https://www.eplocalnews.org/2022/05/05/gravel-racing-a-challenge-for-body-and-mind/)

**2019 Race:** Starting temps upper 30's, peak temps low 80's on Saturday. Saturday evening into Sunday morning, lows mid 40's and highs upper 70's. Winds generally 12-17 mph from mostly south direction. Lack of rain prior to race meant "road crews had been busy dumping a lot of fresh gravel… it covered the majority of the course." (https://ggtri.wordpress.com/test-2/2019-races/2019-iowa-wind-and-rock-iawar/)

**2024 Race:** Started with feel-like temps in low 20's at 4am. Garmin showed temps 28-36°F in early hours. Later in day "the sun even poked out for a bit." Peak daytime temps reached upper 50's-70's range. Nighttime temps during overnight segment dipped significantly causing extreme cold issues for some riders. (https://wilcounchained.substack.com/p/iowa-wind-and-rock-iwar-2024)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Fresh Gravel Prevalence:** Multiple years featured extensive fresh gravel. 2019: "The majority of the course" was covered in fresh limestone in first half, then "a lot more sand" late in race. 2023: "Numerous old Iron bridges! The B-roads were dry and fast and great to actually ride them, instead of walk in the ditch." 2021: First B-road was "tacky, but not sticking, good going, but cautiously watching for build up on the tires" until final 100 yards when "it started sticking." (https://ggtri.wordpress.com/test-2/2019-races/2019-iowa-wind-and-rock-iawar/, https://www.mathewwollmann.com/post/iowa-wind-rock-2023-race-recap, https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/a-success-story-iowa-wind-and-rock/57591)

**Lewis Ave / "THE WORST Non-B-Road":** At mile 44 in 2021, Cory Rood described it as "hands down, THE WORST Non-B-Road I have ever seen. I don't know what this county was doing on this road, but it was nothing but wet, sloppy dirt with road rock mixed in just enough that your tires would pick the rocks up and run them through your frame or drivetrain. This road cost numerous people their race with broken derailleurs and chains." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/a-success-story-iowa-wind-and-rock/57591)

**Bull Run Road:** In 2024, Wilco noted: "This is literally the only road name I remember from the race. Some because I grew up near the town of Bull Run, IL. The second is because in a race filled with hundreds of ridiculous climbs, this road stood out. It had several of the steepest grades we encountered, and the gravel was super chunky and loose." The Strava segment is named "Misery in Missouri." (https://wilcounchained.substack.com/p/iowa-wind-and-rock-iwar-2024)

**Shelby County Fresh Rock:** In 2021, "A couple of roads on this section in Shelby county had fresh rock laid down for a couple mile long sections. The rock they use is horrendous to ride. They spread it the full width of the road, leaving no good line to ride. The rock itself is a mixture of different sizes and is just a major PITA to ride on." Cory Rood opted to walk steeper hills in these sections. (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/a-success-story-iowa-wind-and-rock/57591)

**Missouri B-Roads:** In 2022, John Jarvis and riding partners "dropped down into Missouri and rode six miles of level B backroads before jumping back into Iowa. One thing about Iowa races that is relatively unique is the use of level B backroads. These are dirt roads with no gravel; basically, tractor paths. On a good day, they are deeply rutted and barely rideable. On a bad day, they are full of mud that cakes to tires, jam up drivetrains, and must be walked." The Missouri section was mostly rideable except about a mile. (https://www.eplocalnews.org/2022/05/05/gravel-racing-a-challenge-for-body-and-mind/)

**Elevation Profile:** 2019: 337 miles with 28,000+ feet climbing. 2021: First leg (80.5 miles) had "almost 7k feet of elevation gain," second leg (111 miles) had ~8,300 ft, third leg (150 miles) had remaining elevation to total ~29,000 ft. 2023: 343 miles with over 26,000 ft. 2024: 347.98 miles with 25,000 ft. (Multiple sources)

**Packs of Dogs:** Wilco noted: "Packs of dogs! The scattered residences typically had dogs and lots of them, sometimes barking and howling from cages or some fenced area in the back, but usually roaming free so in the middle of the night passing a farmhouse, you'd find yourself surrounded by 5-10 of various shapes and sizes. Thankfully, none were especially aggressive." (https://wilcounchained.substack.com/p/iowa-wind-and-rock-iwar-2024)

**B-Road Sketch Bridge:** In 2022, John Jarvis encountered "a B-road with a VERY sketch bridge with a kind gentleman there monitoring it for us and yelling directions. Something along the lines of, 'Watch the entrance, and stay on the planks in the center…'" (https://www.eplocalnews.org/2022/05/05/gravel-racing-a-challenge-for-body-and-mind/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**10mph Average Required [ALL LEVELS]:** The race has a 34-hour time limit for ~340 miles with two checkpoints. Must maintain 10mph average to make cutoffs and continue. (https://wilcounchained.substack.com/p/iowa-wind-and-rock-iwar-2024)

**Greg Grandgeorge's Pacing Strategy [ELITE]:** "Target high zone 2 intensity as a maximum for the first few hours, and then ride the fatigue curve downward as the event unfolded. Looking at past Trans Iowa races, I had anticipated somewhere around 28+ hours of ride time, with a Total Training Stress (TSS) score of around (or slightly over) 1100." Finished in 31:16 as 2nd overall. (https://ggtri.wordpress.com/test-2/2019-races/2019-iowa-wind-and-rock-iawar/)

**Checkpoint Cutoff Management [COMPETITIVE]:** Cory Rood arrived at Checkpoint 1 (80.5 miles) with 44-minute cushion, Checkpoint 2 (170.9 miles total) with 2:24 cushion. He noted: "A finish is way more complicated than making sure a few things are done right, hundreds, maybe even thousands of things need to go right for a finish. That said, a Finish was always a goal, but there needs to be a healthy respect for what could end your day and you can't hang your definition of success on a finish." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/a-success-story-iowa-wind-and-rock/57591)

**Mathew Wollmann's Time Management [COMPETITIVE]:** At mile 280 (Casey's in Creston), calculated he needed to average 10 mph for remaining distance to make cutoff. "The next 10 miles I averaged what I needed to, 10 mph." Made conscious effort to minimize gas station stops: "I needed to minimize time off the bike and was quickly moving again." (https://www.mathewwollmann.com/post/iowa-wind-rock-2023-race-recap)

**Nutrition Strategy [COMPETITIVE]:** Greg Grandgeorge carried "enough Carbo Pro / Fructose mix, Honey Stinger Waffles and GU to fuel me for 24 hours (with the thought I'd buy remaining fuel at a C store after that)." He noted: "I also got a little less disciplined on my nutrition after around 24 hours of the race… which possibly hurt me a bit toward the end." (https://ggtri.wordpress.com/test-2/2019-races/2019-iowa-wind-and-rock-iawar/)

**Mathew Wollmann's Convenience Store Strategy [COMPETITIVE]:** At mile 121 Casey's (Essex): "chicken tenders, and another body armor drink, and bought (JR bought) a bunch of toe/hand warmers." At mile 180 Casey's (Malvern): "popcorn chicken bites (Warm food), and body armor, I bought a Pop Tart and splurged on some Cliff Nut Butter bars. I took this opportunity to change headlights, and taillights, put on my headlamp, lube my chain, and prepare for the long night ahead." At mile 280 Casey's (Creston): "refresh my water/Embark mixes, which were slushed from the cold, pound an Under Armor drink, eat some fruit, and take off my extra layers." (https://www.mathewwollmann.com/post/iowa-wind-rock-2023-race-recap)

**Group Riding vs Solo [COMPETITIVE]:** John Jarvis: "We elected to take our chances with the storm, hoping we could pick our way safely through... After all, everyone needs to ride their own pace on something like this, trying to stick with someone that is faster than you will put you in a hole you won't be able to get out of and sticking with someone slower can cost you precious time you don't need to give away." (https://www.eplocalnews.org/2022/05/05/gravel-racing-a-challenge-for-body-and-mind/)

**Wind Drafting Benefits [COMPETITIVE]:** John Jarvis rode with his buddy Rob and later picked up Leonardo from Brazil. "He further lightened our drive into the wind." They worked together trading pulls into headwinds and crosswinds. (https://www.eplocalnews.org/2022/05/05/gravel-racing-a-challenge-for-body-and-mind/)

**Conservative Start Critical [ELITE]:** Greg Grandgeorge: "I was trying to manage the collective damage of the hills by shifting a lot (to keep torque/pedal force down) and avoiding a lot of higher power spikes... Although the pacing was brisk, it was still reasonable enough that there was conversation along the way." His HR was "right around my target values" for first 4 hours riding in a group of 6. (https://ggtri.wordpress.com/test-2/2019-races/2019-iowa-wind-and-rock-iawar/)

**Sunrise = Second Wind [COMPETITIVE]:** Mathew Wollmann: "At sunrise, the typical happened. I woke up feeling like I had slept the entire night. The energy that didn't exist was magically created by the power of the sun." (https://www.mathewwollmann.com/post/iowa-wind-rock-2023-race-recap)

**Sleep Deprivation Management [COMPETITIVE]:** Mathew Wollmann averaging 8mph overnight while fighting hallucinations: "I was talking to myself, singing outloud, and doing everything in my power to stay awake. I had a packet of liquid IV on me which I drank without mixing anything into it. Remember, I can't do caffeine during these races. I've learned that the hard way." Race director Sarah Cooper's intervention at 2:30-3am: pointed out two other riders catching up to provide company and focus. (https://www.mathewwollmann.com/post/iowa-wind-rock-2023-race-recap)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Derailleur Failures from Fresh Rock:** Multiple riders across years experienced derailleur destruction from rocks kicked up in fresh gravel. Cory Rood 2021: "Lewis Ave at mile 44... cost numerous people their race with broken derailleurs and chains." John Jarvis 2022: "A rock kicked up and jammed in my derailleur. Before I could stop pedaling, I heard the sickening sound of metal ripped from metal. My rear wheel locked up... The mangled derailleur was tangled up in the spokes. The chain was wrapped around the axle and bent in multiple places... My race was over at mile 192." Wilco 2024: Similar derailleur failure. (Multiple sources)

**Di2 Battery Failure [RECREATIONAL]:** Brendan Housler's "new di2 battery was a dud and went blank on fifth ride, 200 miles and 15,000 feet in." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/ultra-gravel-racing-riding/15399)

**Broken Spokes / Wheel Issues [RECREATIONAL]:** Wilco around mile 170 had a spoke break causing severe rim wobble. "I think the other was a woman on a fat bike" as the only two people still on rim brakes. Wheel eventually failed completely requiring DNF at mile 192. (https://wilcounchained.substack.com/p/iowa-wind-and-rock-iwar-2024)

**DNF Rate:** 2019: Only 6 finishers out of 57 starters made the 34-hour cutoff (10.5% finish rate). "A few more finished after the cutoff." 2020 (October edition): Cory Rood "calling it quits after 200 miles and 19ish hours" was his goal. 2022: "Approximately half of the field had dropped out" by mile 121. 2023: Finish numbers not specified but described as typical low completion rate. (https://www.cxmagazine.com/2019-iowa-wind-rock-gravel-race-ultra-endurance-transiowa-legacy, https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/a-success-story-iowa-wind-and-rock/57591)

**Weather-Induced Withdrawals:** 2022: Field was 53 riders instead of normal 125 cap because "weather was forecast to be especially horrible... many riders decided to sleep in: Winds were forecast at 25-30 mph with 50 mph gusts and thunderstorms all day." (https://www.eplocalnews.org/2022/05/05/gravel-racing-a-challenge-for-body-and-mind/)

**Hypothermia Risk:** Cory Rood in 2021 referenced his 2020 DNF from hypothermia at Spotted Horse Gravel Ultra as motivation to overpack cold weather gear. Mathew Wollmann 2023: "I just couldn't stop to sleep in the ditch like a summer race because I literally could have frozen. Staying moving was my only option." (https://ggtri.wordpress.com/test-2/2019-races/2019-iowa-wind-and-rock-iawar/, https://www.mathewwollmann.com/post/iowa-wind-rock-2023-race-recap)

**Sleep Deprivation:** Mathew Wollmann averaging 8mph while hallucinating tree canopies and waking up twice with bike almost in ditch. Only intervention from race director and catching other riders kept him going. (https://www.mathewwollmann.com/post/iowa-wind-rock-2023-race-recap)

**Storm Shelter Decision:** 2022 at mile ~170, multiple riders sheltered in a barn for hours during tornadic thunderstorms, losing their cutoff cushion. "Our two-hour margin was gone. We were now about 30 minutes behind" when they resumed. (https://www.eplocalnews.org/2022/05/05/gravel-racing-a-challenge-for-body-and-mind/)

**Navigation Errors:** Greg Grandgeorge noted mental fatigue from cue sheets was significant. In 2021, Cory Rood reported: "It took all of 1 mile before the entire group made a cue sheet error and blew past a turn, literally the second turn! , we weren't even even outside of Winterset!" (https://ggtri.wordpress.com/test-2/2019-races/2019-iowa-wind-and-rock-iawar/, https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/a-success-story-iowa-wind-and-rock/57591)

**B-Road Mud:** Level B backroads can become unrideable with mud that "cakes to tires, jam up drivetrains, and must be walked." (https://www.eplocalnews.org/2022/05/05/gravel-racing-a-challenge-for-body-and-mind/)

**"Got Lost" Late-Race:** John Jarvis's buddy Rob in 2021: "Last year sleep deprivation and fatigue took its toll on him; he got lost and had to abandon the ride." (https://www.eplocalnews.org/2022/05/05/gravel-racing-a-challenge-for-body-and-mind/)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Understated and Minimalist:** Wilco: "The IWAR vibe and people are cool. Everything is understated, calm, and super simple. They make it clear that you're on-your-own with just about everything. Yet, there is deep respect for anyone that shows up to even toe the line. My sense is it's like the Barkley Marathon of gravel races." Registration was "underwhelming, to the point I was wondering, 'am I missing something?' It was a simple table at a winery, they checked my name off a paper list, handed me a totally generic number plate, and offered some various colored pipe cleaners to attach it to my bike." (https://wilcounchained.substack.com/p/iowa-wind-and-rock-iwar-2024)

**No Race Hype:** John Jarvis: "I expected some sort of signage/welcome/pre-race hype/pat on the back, but there was none of that to be had anywhere." (https://www.eplocalnews.org/2022/05/05/gravel-racing-a-challenge-for-body-and-mind/)

**Free Entry:** The race is free to enter. Website states: "A free, 340ish mile, cue sheet navigated, late spring, Iowa event that allows entrants to challenge themselves, expand their boundaries, and allow them to see what they are capable of." (https://iowawindandrock.com/)

**Volunteer Support:** 2019 race had "team of 12 volunteers helped keep track of participants." Sarah Cooper personally checked on riders during overnight sections. At Checkpoint 1 in 2021, Cory Rood noted: "All the volunteers at the checkpoint were positive and reassuring me that things were not as dire as I felt they were. Sarah told me to just keep moving and see what happens." (https://www.cxmagazine.com/2019-iowa-wind-rock-gravel-race-ultra-endurance-transiowa-legacy, https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/a-success-story-iowa-wind-and-rock/57591)

**Race Director Sarah Cooper on B-Road Monitor:** In 2019, Greg Grandgeorge: "Met the race directors and volunteers at an old Iron bridge on a B-road and everyone was commenting how good I was looking at that point." In 2022, John Jarvis noted race director presence at the sketch bridge with volunteer monitoring and shouting directions. (https://ggtri.wordpress.com/test-2/2019-races/2019-iowa-wind-and-rock-iawar/, https://www.eplocalnews.org/2022/05/05/gravel-racing-a-challenge-for-body-and-mind/)

**TransIowa Legacy:** Website explicitly states: "Iowa Wind and Rock is NOT, nor will it ever be TransIowa. However, we want to provide people a similar challenge." Race directors Sarah Cooper, Steve Fuller, and Dennis Grelk are "TransIowa finishers" who created IWAR after TransIowa's final edition in 2018. (https://iowawindandrock.com/, https://www.cxmagazine.com/2019-iowa-wind-rock-gravel-race-ultra-endurance-transiowa-legacy)

**Unicorn Mascot:** Greg Grandgeorge: "I should mention that the unicorn is the mascot of the race. This is probably born of the idea that one might see a unicorn vision in a period of deep fatigue. This year the course roughly formed a unicorn outline." (https://ggtri.wordpress.com/test-2/2019-races/2019-iowa-wind-and-rock-iawar/)

**Drop Bags:** Introduced in 2020, riders get a 2-gallon ziplock bag at each checkpoint with whatever they want. Cory R
