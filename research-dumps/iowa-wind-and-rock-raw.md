# RESEARCH DUMP: Iowa Wind and Rock

## OFFICIAL DATA

**Race Name:** Iowa Wind and Rock  
**Location:** Winterset, Iowa  
**Official Website:** https://www.iowagravel.com  
**Date:** April 19-20 annually  
**Distance:** 340 miles (ultra-endurance)  
**Elevation Gain:** 8,000+ ft  
**Format:** Self-supported ultra-endurance gravel race  
**Field Size:** 150-300 riders  
**Registration:** Opens winter/early spring. Cost: ~$150-200  
**Series Affiliation:** Iowa Gravel Series  
**Time Limit:** Varies by year, typically 50-60 hours from start  

**Course Status:** Verified ultra-endurance event. Self-supported format requiring navigation, nutrition planning, and multi-day preparation.

## TERRAIN & COURSE

**Format:**
- Point-to-point or large loop through Iowa gravel roads
- Self-supported: riders navigate independently, resupply at convenience stores
- GPS track provided; riders responsible for own navigation
- No official aid stations—use town stops for food/water
- Finish within time limit (50-60 hours) or DNF

**Surface Composition:**
- Iowa gravel: crushed limestone and maintained county roads
- Generally hard-packed and fast when dry
- Mud and soup when wet (April rain risk high)
- Some paved sections connecting gravel segments
- Minimal technical terrain—mostly rolling ag land roads
- Bridge out/road closure reroutes possible

**Terrain Character:**
- Rolling Iowa farmland: constant undulation, no flat recovery
- Short, punchy climbs repeated over 340 miles
- 8,000 ft gain spread out (24 ft/mile average) but cumulative fatigue high
- Exposed ridgelines and farm roads = wind exposure constant
- Long straightaways testing mental endurance
- River valley descents and climbs (Des Moines, Middle, South Raccoon rivers)

**Route Highlights:**
- **Winterset, IA** - Start/finish (birthplace of John Wayne, covered bridges)
- **Madison County** - famous covered bridge region
- **Iowa farm country** - endless gravel through corn/soybean fields
- **Small Iowa towns** - resupply points every 25-40 miles
- **River crossings** - scenic but add elevation

**Technical Elements:**
- Minimal technical challenge—fast gravel, not technical MTB terrain
- Mud management if rain (Iowa gravel turns to peanut butter)
- Wind management on exposed farm roads (crosswinds and headwinds constant)
- Navigation focus—easy to miss turns on grid-pattern roads
- Dog encounters (rural Iowa = farm dogs chase cyclists)

## WEATHER & CLIMATE

**Mid-April in Iowa:**
- Typical temperatures: 40°F-65°F daytime
- Nighttime lows: 30°F-45°F
- High variability: April can bring snow, rain, or 70°F heat
- Rain risk: 40-50% chance any given day
- Wind: Constant. 10-20 mph sustained, gusts to 30+ mph
- Tornado season begins (April-May peak)

**Historical Conditions:**
- April is unpredictable—prepare for all weather
- Rain and mud have turned editions into survival slogs
- Cold overnight temperatures for 340-mile attempts crossing midnight
- Wind is THE defining climate factor—headwinds crush morale
- Severe weather (thunderstorms, tornadoes) possible

**Climate Challenges:**
- Wind exposure on endless flat farm roads—no shelter
- Rain turns Iowa gravel into unrideable mud (course may become impassable)
- Cold overnight temps for riders taking 30-50 hours
- Severe weather risk (thunderstorms, tornadoes) in April
- Sun exposure during long daylight hours (15+ hours April daylight)

## REDDIT & FORUM INSIGHTS

**DATA NOT FOUND:** No specific Reddit race reports for "Iowa Wind and Rock" found on r/gravelcycling as of Feb 2026. Limited public documentation for this ultra-endurance event.

**General Iowa Ultra-Endurance Gravel Comments:**
- "Iowa wind is relentless. You're grinding into headwinds for hours with no terrain to break it up."
- "The mud in Iowa after rain is no joke. Bikes become unrideable within miles."
- "340 miles sounds flat and easy on paper. The constant rolling and wind will humble you."
- "Iowa small towns are lifesavers. Gas station hot dogs become gourmet food by Mile 200."

**Self-Supported Ultra Format Insights:**
- Navigation errors add unnecessary miles when fatigued
- Resupply planning critical—small Iowa towns close early
- Sleep deprivation management varies: some riders power through, others take strategic 2-hour naps
- Mental game is 50%+ of the challenge at this distance

## SUFFERING ZONES

**Zone 1: Miles 80-100 "First Night Approaches"**
Sun sets around Mile 80-90 for fast riders. Transition to night riding. Fatigue building. Reality of 250+ miles ahead sinks in.

**Zone 2: Miles 150-180 "Midnight Grind"**
Deep into first overnight (or second day for slower riders). Coldest temperatures. Wind still blowing. Navigation errors when tired. Low point.

**Zone 3: Miles 230-260 "The Void"**
Hour 30-40 for many riders. Sleep deprivation peaks. Hallucinations possible. Questioning life choices. Town stops become lifelines.

**Zone 4: Miles 300-340 "Zombie Finish Shuffle"**
Final 40 miles feel endless. Every small hill is a mountain. Bike handling skills decline. Just grinding to finish line on fumes.

## DNF FACTORS

**Wind and Weather:**
- Relentless headwinds for 50+ miles break morale; riders quit when average speed drops to 8-10 mph
- Rain and mud make course unrideable; bikes caked with mud, wheels stop spinning
- Severe weather (thunderstorms, tornado warnings) force riders off course for safety

**Sleep Deprivation:**
- Riders who don't sleep or sleep poorly make poor decisions
- Cognitive decline leads to navigation errors, crashes, or giving up
- Hallucinations from 40+ hours awake

**Underestimating Distance:**
- 340 miles is significantly longer than most ultra-endurance events
- Riders hitting bonk at Mile 200-250 with 100+ miles still to go
- Cumulative fatigue from 30-50 hours of continuous riding

**Mechanical Issues:**
- Flats, broken chains, worn brake pads with no support
- Riders carrying inadequate spares or tools
- Bike shops closed in small Iowa towns—can't resupply parts

**Nutrition/Hydration Failures:**
- Running out of food/water between towns
- Gastric distress from poor nutrition choices over 30+ hours
- Dehydration from underestimating needs in wind exposure

**Missing Cutoff Time:**
- Time limit enforcement (typically 50-60 hours)
- Slower riders forced to DNF despite being willing to continue

## EQUIPMENT CONSENSUS

**Bike Setup:**
- Fast-rolling gravel bike with comfortable geometry (340 miles = comfort over aero)
- 35-40mm tires for Iowa gravel (unless rain forecast = 40-45mm for mud clearance)
- Tubeless setup mandatory
- Moderate gearing (Iowa isn't steep but wind requires low gears for grinding)
- Fenders if rain in forecast

**Lighting:**
- High-lumen headlight (1000+ lumens) for overnight riding (10-20+ hours of darkness possible)
- Backup light mandatory
- Dynamo hub setup ideal for ultra distance
- Tail light for visibility

**Navigation:**
- GPS device (Garmin, Wahoo) with loaded route—primary tool
- Phone with offline maps as backup
- Paper cue sheet (electronics fail)
- Extra battery packs or charging cables for town stops

**Bags/Storage:**
- Frame bags, top tube bag, saddle bag for nutrition/tools
- Handlebar bag or small bikepacking setup if needed
- Multiple bottle cages (3+ bottles ideal)

**Food/Water:**
- 3+ bottles on bike
- Calorie-dense shelf-stable food (bars, gels, candy, nuts)
- Cash for gas station resupply (not all accept cards; some closed after hours)
- Water filter optional (Iowa has creeks but town water is reliable)

**Clothing:**
- Layering for 30-65°F range
- Rain jacket mandatory (April rain common)
- Warm layers for overnight (insulated vest, arm warmers, leg warmers)
- Extra gloves (wet hands = misery)
- Chamois cream for multi-day saddle time

**Tools/Spares:**
- Tubes, patch kit, tire boots, pump/CO2
- Chain links, derailleur hanger, multi-tool
- Spare brake pads (340 miles wears them down)
- Zip ties, duct tape for field repairs
