# IRON CROSS — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Cole House [ELITE]:** "I had no idea what to expect. I have never done this race. I came out early to ride a couple sections, and I actually drove the road sections. That paid off big time. There was so much climbing - if you don't know how long it is mentally, you can kind of give up. If you know where you are, it's a big advantage." (https://ironcrossrace.blogspot.com/)

**Cole House [ELITE]:** "Some said it was pretty rocky. On the road sections, 'cross bikes had a bit of an advantage, but you could draft and not do too much work. Racing my mountain bike was how I got my gap for the win - on the trails. I knew that was where I had to push it." (https://ironcrossrace.blogspot.com/)

**Cole House [ELITE]:** "When they had said 'run-up', I was thinking we were going to run up a little rocky hill. Instead, we ran up a cliff. That was shocker." (https://ironcrossrace.blogspot.com/)

**Brian Toone [ELITE]:** "I accidentally came unclipped and couldn't get back in, and so I had to run down one of the descents... I ended up on the big climb thinking I should go as hard as possible because I'm not as good on the singletrack, so I went as hard as I could and left the guys I was with. From there until the end, I was by myself, and I ended up catching three of the lead guys to take second. It was fun. I loved it. The ATV trails were so fun on the descents. It was so fast." (https://ironcrossrace.blogspot.com/)

**Ruth Sherman [ELITE]:** "Somebody told me Cheryl was out, but I had no idea about Selene, so I assumed I was in second or third most of the way. I was by myself a lot which always makes me nervous because I'm afraid I might go off course." (https://ironcrossrace.blogspot.com/)

**Cheryl Sornson [ELITE]:** "One of those sharp shale pieces caught my tire and cut it almost in half. Fortunately I had a number plate from my last race that was Tyvek, so I was able to boot it. It was still sticking out, but I was able to limp back about 10 miles into aid station #2." (https://ironcrossrace.blogspot.com/)

**Selene Yeager [ELITE]:** "Right before we were going to come toward aid station #2, we asked a moto which way, and he said straight so we went straight. We went four miles off course. I didn't see the arrows - I will own it, I'm bad at that. I had good legs today from the time I woke up this morning, so I was disappointed." (https://ironcrossrace.blogspot.com/)

**Daniel Rapp [ELITE - Singlespeed]:** "I was apprehensive about the race and changed my gearing at about 6:00 am this morning to make it a little harder. I think it paid off. The gear hurt, but it was ultimately the right decision." Switched from 36x18 to 36x17. (https://ironcrossrace.blogspot.com/)

**Stephan Kincaid [ELITE - Singlespeed]:** "Thirty miles in, I realized there were just five of us. Figuring out who was where, I turned around to look and a hit a pothole and flew off my bike just before we got to aid station #2. My biggest disappointment about the whole thing was that I crashed Madison Matthews, who won the U25 category at the Trans-Sylvania Epic." Cracked his helmet and briefly blacked out but continued to finish third. (https://ironcrossrace.blogspot.com/)

**McCluskey [COMPETITIVE]:** "Dark. Cold. The alarm went off at 4:45a. Ugh. Ok. Let's do this... 'How much' and 'what to wear' was the big question of the day. Full rain pants? What kind of gloves? Glasses or no? If so, which lenses?" Racing in cold, steady autumn rain that continued all day. (https://www.worldwidecyclery.com/blogs/worldwide-cyclery-blog/my-experience-at-the-iron-cross-race)

**McCluskey [COMPETITIVE]:** "Up and up we go into the fog. 'Climbing' is going to be the word of the day. Bombing down PA-44 at 40 miles an hour in the wet with cars was 'fun'... It wasn't until I left here I finally started to get into a groove and felt warmed up enough. The hardest parts were yet to come." (https://www.worldwidecyclery.com/blogs/worldwide-cyclery-blog/my-experience-at-the-iron-cross-race)

**McCluskey [COMPETITIVE]:** "After several of these water crossings, the course turns right at a 90-degree angle, right into single track. Up. Up. Steeper. Up still. Steeper. Wheels slipping on the wet leaves and rocks. Time to get off and start pushing. This is not something I like to do, I'd rather ride. But that's part of the challenge of this course." (https://www.worldwidecyclery.com/blogs/worldwide-cyclery-blog/my-experience-at-the-iron-cross-race)

**McCluskey [COMPETITIVE]:** "I could hear the sound of Angus Young's guitar and smell of campfire. Then a yell of 'YEAH!! WOO!! ALRIGHT!!' With a raucous roar of enthusiasm, an unofficial stop at Larry's Tavern welcomed and cheered riders by passing out beers, pickle/vodka shots and chunks of grilled venison!" (https://www.worldwidecyclery.com/blogs/worldwide-cyclery-blog/my-experience-at-the-iron-cross-race)

**2024 Iron Cross Participant [UNKNOWN]:** "This was my first time and I have to say, all the people that worked it were amazing and very friendly!! That alone makes me wanna come back and support it! Awesome job and thank you everyone that helped in it! Keep up the amazing work!" (https://ironcrossgravel.com/)

**Jason [ELITE]:** "As soon as I took the first pedal stroke, there was something special about it. The fit was spot on and it felt very comfortable. On the descents it is composed, compliant and confidence inspiring. It's very efficient at climbing. All power put into it goes to propelling the bike forward even with the compliance it has while descending. I don't know what kind of science or magic they put into this frame, but OPEN nailed it!" (https://worldwidecyclery.com/blogs/worldwide-cyclery-blog/open-u-p-wi-de-force-eagle-axs-gravel-bike-rider-review)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Mountain Bike vs Gravel/CX Bike:**

**Cole House [ELITE]:** Chose mountain bike over cross bike after previewing sections. "Racing my mountain bike was how I got my gap for the win - on the trails... I just popped over those logs. That's where a mountain bike really paid off, and I got a gap of a minute there over the other two." (https://ironcrossrace.blogspot.com/)

**Carla Williams [ELITE]:** Broke her front derailleur on the prologue. "I was pretty much by myself until right at the end. I was riding in third until near the end when I passed Swan and came up on Ruth near the finish, at the end of that last climb. I could get up all the hills ok; it's just that some of the straight aways were a little tough" riding in small chainring only. (https://ironcrossrace.blogspot.com/)

**Tire Recommendations:**

**DocSavage [UNKNOWN]:** "If the RD lets everyone know in the course description that there will be single track, rock on. It does separate those of us riding bigger tires, Maxxis Treadlites 2.1, from the roadies riding skinnies and trying to race fast gravel/almost road." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/thoughts-on-singletrack-in-a-gravel-event/19514)

**Drivetrain:**

**Jason [ELITE]:** "The AXS mullet drivetrain fits this bike perfectly. It offers tons of range for both on road & off. My only gripe is about the gaps in the gearing. Sometimes I'd like to have something in-between the gears but it's a small price to pay for the versatility and simplicity offered by a 1x set-up with this kind of range." (https://worldwidecyclery.com/blogs/worldwide-cyclery-blog/open-u-p-wi-de-force-eagle-axs-gravel-bike-rider-review)

**Gear Ratio [ELITE - Singlespeed]:**

**Daniel Rapp:** Changed from 36x18 to 36x17 at 6am race morning. "The gear hurt, but it was ultimately the right decision." (https://ironcrossrace.blogspot.com/)

**Tire Repair:**

**Cheryl Sornson [ELITE]:** Successfully used a Tyvek race number plate to boot a severely cut tire: "I had a number plate from my last race that was Tyvek, so I was able to boot it. It was still sticking out, but I was able to limp back about 10 miles into aid station #2." (https://ironcrossrace.blogspot.com/)

## Weather Experienced

**2017 Race [COMPETITIVE]:** "Dark. Cold... cold, steady autumn rain that continued all day... The wet pavement gives way to leaf covered wet and muddy gravel... thick wet mud, with standing water ponds on the double track... Wheels slipping on the wet leaves and rocks... the sky opened up and the rain came and wind came in sideways, pelting my face and pushing me side to side." Finished "soaked to the bone." (https://www.worldwidecyclery.com/blogs/worldwide-cyclery-blog/my-experience-at-the-iron-cross-race)

**2013 Race [ELITE]:** "Racers competed in perfect trail and weather conditions, with sunny skies and comfortable temperatures all day." 68-mile course. (https://ironcrossrace.blogspot.com/)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**The Hike-A-Bike Section:**

**Cole House [ELITE]:** "When they had said 'run-up', I was thinking we were going to run up a little rocky hill. Instead, we ran up a cliff. That was shocker." This was the section he had NOT previewed. (https://ironcrossrace.blogspot.com/)

**McCluskey [COMPETITIVE]:** "Now I was at the 'run-up'. A wall of thick moss-covered loose rocks going straight up to the heavens." (https://www.worldwidecyclery.com/blogs/worldwide-cyclery-blog/my-experience-at-the-iron-cross-race)

**Singletrack Characteristics:**

**McCluskey [COMPETITIVE]:** "After several of these water crossings, the course turns right at a 90-degree angle, right into single track. Up. Up. Steeper. Up still. Steeper. Wheels slipping on the wet leaves and rocks." (https://www.worldwidecyclery.com/blogs/worldwide-cyclery-blog/my-experience-at-the-iron-cross-race)

**Cole House [ELITE]:** Second major singletrack section "was not as rocky as earlier singletrack, several logs and a steep climb made the section more challenging for those on 'cross bikes." (https://ironcrossrace.blogspot.com/)

**Course Character:**

**Brian Toone [ELITE]:** "There was so much climbing... The ATV trails were so fun on the descents. It was so fast." (https://ironcrossrace.blogspot.com/)

**McCluskey [COMPETITIVE]:** "More climbing on the ATV trails and then it flattened out, into thick wet mud, with standing water ponds on the double track." (https://www.worldwidecyclery.com/blogs/worldwide-cyclery-blog/my-experience-at-the-iron-cross-race)

**Road Sections:**

**Cole House [ELITE]:** "Bombing down PA-44 at 40 miles an hour in the wet with cars was 'fun'. A hard right turn at the base of the hill and we rode through some farmland then back up into the forest to the first rest stop around the 22 mile mark." (https://www.worldwidecyclery.com/blogs/worldwide-cyclery-blog/my-experience-at-the-iron-cross-race)

**Hazards:**

**Cheryl Sornson [ELITE]:** "One of those sharp shale pieces caught my tire and cut it almost in half" on a gravel descent. (https://ironcrossrace.blogspot.com/)

**Stephan Kincaid [ELITE]:** "I turned around to look and a hit a pothole and flew off my bike" at 30 miles in during a fast descent. (https://ironcrossrace.blogspot.com/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Course Preview Value [ELITE]:**

**Cole House:** "I came out early to ride a couple sections, and I actually drove the road sections. That paid off big time. There was so much climbing - if you don't know how long it is mentally, you can kind of give up. If you know where you are, it's a big advantage." (https://ironcrossrace.blogspot.com/)

**When to Attack [ELITE]:**

**Brian Toone:** "I ended up on the big climb thinking I should go as hard as possible because I'm not as good on the singletrack, so I went as hard as I could and left the guys I was with." Strategy worked - moved from chase group to second place. (https://ironcrossrace.blogspot.com/)

**Cole House:** "Mike was suffering, and I knew the descent, so I went for it and I caught them just before Bunker Hill Road... I just popped over those logs. That's where a mountain bike really paid off, and I got a gap of a minute there over the other two. From there, I went all out." After getting the gap: "From then on, it was damage control... I rode my pace and made sure no one was catching me." (https://ironcrossrace.blogspot.com/)

**Warm-up Time [COMPETITIVE]:**

**McCluskey:** "It wasn't until I left here [first rest stop around mile 22] I finally started to get into a groove and felt warmed up enough. The hardest parts were yet to come." (https://www.worldwidecyclery.com/blogs/worldwide-cyclery-blog/my-experience-at-the-iron-cross-race)

**Fueling at Larry's Tavern [LOCATION-SPECIFIC]:**

**McCluskey [COMPETITIVE]:** After the hike-a-bike: "I could hear the sound of Angus Young's guitar and smell of campfire... an unofficial stop at Larry's Tavern welcomed and cheered riders by passing out beers, pickle/vodka shots and chunks of grilled venison! With a slap on the back, they would let us know you know, you had another 4 miles down the 'flat' gravel road to the next aid station. I made my way to the road, head down, venison and vodka fueled, I hammered to the next station." (https://www.worldwidecyclery.com/blogs/worldwide-cyclery-blog/my-experience-at-the-iron-cross-race)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Navigation Errors:**

**Selene Yeager [ELITE]:** Went 4 miles off course with a group of men when a moto marshal gave incorrect direction: "Right before we were going to come toward aid station #2, we asked a moto which way, and he said straight so we went straight. We went four miles off course." Was in contention for the win. (https://ironcrossrace.blogspot.com/)

**Cole House [ELITE]:** Made a wrong turn during first singletrack section: "As he realized his mistake and made the correction, two groups of top riders passed, and he had some work to do to catch back up." (https://ironcrossrace.blogspot.com/)

**Mechanical Failures:**

**Cheryl Sornson [ELITE]:** Flatted early with tire "cut almost in half" by sharp shale. Required 10-mile limp to aid station #2 with improvised boot. Dropped from lead to 5th. (https://ironcrossrace.blogspot.com/)

**Carla Williams [ELITE]:** Broke front derailleur on the prologue, forced to ride entire race in small chainring only. Still finished 3rd in women's race. (https://ironcrossrace.blogspot.com/)

**Crashes:**

**Stephan Kincaid [ELITE]:** "Thirty miles in... I turned around to look and a hit a pothole and flew off my bike." Cracked helmet, briefly blacked out. Continued to finish 3rd in singlespeed category. (https://ironcrossrace.blogspot.com/)

**Brian Toone [ELITE]:** "I accidentally came unclipped and couldn't get back in, and so I had to run down one of the descents." Lost contact with leaders but chased back. (https://ironcrossrace.blogspot.com/)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Larry's Tavern [Unofficial Aid Station]:**

**McCluskey [COMPETITIVE]:** "I could hear the sound of Angus Young's guitar and smell of campfire. Then a yell of 'YEAH!! WOO!! ALRIGHT!!' With a raucous roar of enthusiasm, an unofficial stop at Larry's Tavern welcomed and cheered riders by passing out beers, pickle/vodka shots and chunks of grilled venison! With a slap on the back, they would let us know you know, you had another 4 miles down the 'flat' gravel road to the next aid station." (https://www.worldwidecyclery.com/blogs/worldwide-cyclery-blog/my-experience-at-the-iron-cross-race)

**Post-Race:**

**McCluskey [COMPETITIVE]:** "After a long time getting out of my wet clothes, I packed up and headed over to The Brickyard Restaurant & Ale House for food and beer and the awards and finisher's gift, a soccer scarf. Great for those cold days coming soon here in the Mid-Atlantic." (https://www.worldwidecyclery.com/blogs/worldwide-cyclery-blog/my-experience-at-the-iron-cross-race)

**Event Character:**

**McCluskey [COMPETITIVE]:** "The Iron Cross race is like any other, and it's in a category all on its own. It will test your mental and physical abilities, but it will make you glad you did. I can't wait until next year." (https://www.worldwidecyclery.com/blogs/worldwide-cyclery-blog/my-experience-at-the-iron-cross-race)

**2024 Participant [UNKNOWN]:** "This was my first time and I have to say, all the people that worked it were amazing and very friendly!! That alone makes me wanna come back and support it!" (https://ironcrossgravel.com/)
