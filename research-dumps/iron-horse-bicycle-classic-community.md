# IRON HORSE BICYCLE CLASSIC — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Tom Mayer [UNKNOWN] (original 1971 challenger):** "Tom was a young bicycling enthusiast who enjoyed riding alongside the railroad tracks. One day in 1971, Tom challenged his older brother to a race to Silverton. Steam engine versus bicycle. They wagered a candy bar on the results. When Jim pulled into the Silverton station, there was Tom, waiting for him. He'd beaten the train, despite having a longer road and having to climb two mountain passes." (https://www.cpr.org/2022/05/26/bike-vs-train-the-story-behind-durangos-iron-horse-bicycle-classic/)

**amputee_cyclist [ELITE]:** "Always wanted to do the Iron Horse race since I first heard of it years ago. Absolutely beautiful setting. Bucket-list checkmark for sure. First event since losing my leg. Felt awesome just to complete it and plan to do it again next year. Didn't see Ned Overend myself, but he competed. He did 2h:15m:18s at 67yo! (1st place was 2h:7m:31s for comparison.) What a beast!" (https://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/comments/1463ltp/i_beat_the_train_2023_iron_horse_bicycle_classic/)

**Race Director Ian Burnett [COMPETITIVE]:** "We got super fortunate with the weather, number one. That was a pretty amazing weekend of weather. But overall, the weekend was great and went as planned. There were a couple of little hiccups here and there, but all things that we could face in the moment. We were really pleased about how it went, and it seemed like there was great feedback from the community." (https://www.durangoherald.com/articles/ian-burnett-reflects-on-iron-horse-bicycle-classic-looks-ahead/)

**Race Director Ian Burnett [COMPETITIVE] on the MTB course energy:** "Riders told Burnett that they felt the mountain bike race would be pretty basic when they were riding the course pre-race. But, when it came to race time, the energy around Steamworks and throughout the community was fantastic, making the race dynamic and fun for the riders." (https://www.durangoherald.com/articles/ian-burnett-reflects-on-iron-horse-bicycle-classic-looks-ahead/)

**Race Director Ian Burnett [COMPETITIVE] on downtown appeal:** "Having a closed highway that you get to ride on is something that's so unique and something you can come back and do again and again and it's still a beautiful, amazing experience and it's different every time" (https://velo.outsideonline.com/news/history-iron-horse-bicycle-classic-returns-for-52nd-year)

**Race Director Ian Burnett [COMPETITIVE] on the highway closure:** "We're the only race in the country that we know that closes a (U.S.) highway for the race. But also, there's an exciting factor to ride that closed road – that tradition." (https://www.durangoherald.com/articles/iron-horse-bicycle-classic-makes-its-return-to-downtown-durango-this-weekend/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**[ELITE] Winning times:** Men's road race winner Caleb Classen finished in 2:07:18. Women's winner Kira Payer finished in 2:30:28 (2023 results). (https://www.cyclingwest.com/racing/road-racing/51st-iron-horse-bicycle-classic-brief-results/)

**[ELITE] Age-group performance:** Ned Overend at 67 years old completed the road race in 2:15:18, compared to 1st place at 2:07:31 (2023). (https://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/comments/1463ltp/i_beat_the_train_2023_iron_horse_bicycle_classic/)

**[ALL LEVELS] Time range and cutoffs:** "The professional racers can do this route in about 2 hours and 15 minutes. For some of the first-timers, it takes them right in the area of 6 hours." Riders must pass Coal Bank Pass by 12:40 p.m. and Molas Pass by 1:20 p.m. or they will be pulled from the race, as the highway between Purgatory and Silverton is only closed until 1:30 p.m. (https://www.cpr.org/2022/05/26/bike-vs-train-the-story-behind-durangos-iron-horse-bicycle-classic/ and https://www.durangoherald.com/articles/iron-horse-bicycle-classic-makes-its-return-to-downtown-durango-this-weekend/)

**[ELITE] Gravel race times:** Men's gravel long course (95 miles, 7,700 feet climbing): Guy Leshem and Jess Clapier tied at 4:50:49. Women's: Sarah Sturm won in 5:06:37. (https://www.cyclingwest.com/racing/road-racing/51st-iron-horse-bicycle-classic-brief-results/)

**[ELITE] Mountain bike race times:** Men's MTB (5-mile laps, 600 feet elevation per lap): Howard Grotts won in 1:41:26. Women's: Michaela Thompson won in 1:35:16. (https://www.cyclingwest.com/racing/road-racing/51st-iron-horse-bicycle-classic-brief-results/)

**[ALL LEVELS] Race dynamics:** "A group of about 20 riders stayed together for the first half of the men's race before the group splintered on the climb up Coal Bank Pass." (https://www.cyclingwest.com/racing/road-racing/51st-iron-horse-bicycle-classic-brief-results/)

**[UNKNOWN] Wind conditions:** "Burnett said riders should anticipate 15 to 20 mph gusts on Saturday, which will be a tail wind" (2025 forecast). (https://www.durangoherald.com/articles/iron-horse-bicycle-classic-makes-its-return-to-downtown-durango-this-weekend/)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Course profile:** "The iconic 47-mile road race starts at 6,512 feet in elevation. Riders travel through Hermosa and past Purgatory Resort before climbing Coal Bank Pass and Molas Pass, both over 10,000 feet. The race finishes in Silverton at 9,318 feet." Total elevation gain: more than 5,000 feet. (https://www.durangoherald.com/articles/iron-horse-bicycle-classic-makes-its-return-to-downtown-durango-this-weekend/)

**Road closure details:** "Riders get to enjoy a full lane to themselves through the first 15 miles of the route before 2-way traffic begins again just as the climbing starts. Once they reach Purgatory ski resort, the final 20 miles featuring the toughest climbs and fastest descents are fully closed to traffic in both directions — an experience that feels like you're riding through the Alps during the Tour de France." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/news/history-iron-horse-bicycle-classic-returns-for-52nd-year)

**Train vs. bike route:** "The train never reaches the elevations that the bike riders do, so one could argue that the bike riders have an even harder route. It stays along the River Valley, whereas the highway goes over the mountain passes." The train takes 3 hours and 30 minutes to 3 hours and 45 minutes. (https://www.cpr.org/2022/05/26/bike-vs-train-the-story-behind-durangos-iron-horse-bicycle-classic/)

**Proximity to train:** "For the first 10 miles, [the train] travels almost next to the road that you're on, so you get a feel right away if you are keeping up, or going behind. It's a flat section through our valley leaving town, and then we get into the hills and the train starts taking a different — albeit a bit easier route — to Silverton." (https://www.cpr.org/2022/05/26/bike-vs-train-the-story-behind-durangos-iron-horse-bicycle-classic/)

**Mountain bike course (2025):** "The Subaru Mountain Bike Race will begin at Buckley Park, where riders will complete a lap around the park before heading south on East Second Avenue to Eighth Street. At Eighth Street, they'll turn north on East Fifth Avenue into the singletrack. Riders will take a lap on the Rim Trail, descend the south side of the Factory Trail, ride the lower part of the Nature Trail onto East Fifth Avenue, then reverse course down Eighth Street through Steamworks before finishing at Buckley Park." (https://www.durangoherald.com/articles/iron-horse-bicycle-classic-makes-its-return-to-downtown-durango-this-weekend/)

**Mountain bike course details (2023):** "The course started at Chapman Hill and raced up Lion's Den Trail, around Rim Trail, and back down through the Chapman Hill Flow Trail" - five-mile laps with nearly 600 feet of elevation gain per lap. (https://www.cyclingwest.com/racing/road-racing/51st-iron-horse-bicycle-classic-brief-results/)

**Gravel course:** "The 55-mile course includes 4,985 feet of climbing. Riders will start at 8 a.m., ascend Horse Gulch Road, loop around Texas Creek to the east, then return west to Horse Gulch Road and finish at Steamworks." (https://www.durangoherald.com/articles/iron-horse-bicycle-classic-makes-its-return-to-downtown-durango-this-weekend/)

**Spectator locations recommended:** "Burnett recommends Shalona Hill, which features the first climb as riders cross the train tracks. It also provides a convenient turnaround point without road closure issues. Another popular spot, Burnett said, is the top of Molas Pass – a high-energy area riders look forward to reaching because it's all downhill to Silverton from there." (https://www.durangoherald.com/articles/iron-horse-bicycle-classic-makes-its-return-to-downtown-durango-this-weekend/)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Finish rate:** "We only have about 20 every year that don't make it the whole way. So, our finish rate is extremely high." (https://www.cpr.org/2022/05/26/bike-vs-train-the-story-behind-durangos-iron-horse-bicycle-classic/)

**Thumbtack sabotage (2024):** "One of the bigger headlines associated with last year's McDonald's Citizen Tour Ride was the spreading of thumbtacks on the course. As many as 50 riders suffered flat tires because of tacks spread on Highway 550 at the intersection with County Road 203 and near Trimble Crossing." Organizers responded with law enforcement presence, sweepers, and magnetic collection ahead of the race. (https://www.durangoherald.com/articles/iron-horse-bicycle-classic-makes-its-return-to-downtown-durango-this-weekend/)

**Mechanical in 2023 women's race:** "On Coal Bank Pass, it was Sturm vs. Payer, with Payer gaining an advantage due to a dropped chain from Sturm. Despite a determined chase from Sturm, Payer crossed the line solo with a time of 2:30:28." (https://www.cyclingwest.com/racing/road-racing/51st-iron-horse-bicycle-classic-brief-results/)

## Weather Experienced

**2008 cancellation:** "In 2008, it snowed 18 inches on Cold Bank Pass. That canceled the event altogether. But we have also had years where it snowed during the event, melted off and people keep going. Weather is our biggest challenge each and every year." (https://www.cpr.org/2022/05/26/bike-vs-train-the-story-behind-durangos-iron-horse-bicycle-classic/)

**2025 conditions:** "The weather is expected to be fantastic, with a high in the mid-70s on Saturday in Durango and a high in the mid-50s in Silverton." (https://www.durangoherald.com/articles/iron-horse-bicycle-classic-makes-its-return-to-downtown-durango-this-weekend/)

**2023 conditions:** "We had a beautiful day for the ride and race to Silverton" - Race Director Ian Burnett. (https://www.cyclingwest.com/racing/road-racing/51st-iron-horse-bicycle-classic-brief-results/)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Diversity of participants:** "It has become a tradition for road bikers and cyclists in our region and across the country. This year, we will have riders from 43 states and five countries. That's fairly customary for us, and [competitors] range from professional-level athletes to the first-timer, weekend-warrior people setting a goal for themselves to get in shape." About 2,000 riders compete, with everyone "from pros to costume-wearers to those who ride with flat pedals while wearing jeans." (https://www.cpr.org/2022/05/26/bike-vs-train-the-story-behind-durangos-iron-horse-bicycle-classic/ and https://velo.outsideonline.com/news/history-iron-horse-bicycle-classic-returns-for-52nd-year)

**2025 expected participation:** "Burnett expects a total of 1,800 cyclists to compete in the Coca-Cola Road Race and the McDonald's Citizen Tour Ride. He anticipates about 1,200 citizen tour riders and 600 road racers." (https://www.durangoherald.com/articles/iron-horse-bicycle-classic-makes-its-return-to-downtown-durango-this-weekend/)

**Community support:** "Spectators line the route, cheer riders through town, and enjoy the sights and sounds of the steam train rolling through mountain canyons. Families, friends, and fans gather to soak in the energy, support the riders, enjoy live music and beer gardens and experience one of Durango's most beloved traditions." (https://www.ironhorsebicycleclassic.com/)

**Ned Overend phenomenon:** "Most people get off the bike and they say, 'How did Ned do,' because he is by far, as I've said before, the ambassador or the Pope of Silverton... there are people that are just thrilled when they get passed by Ned Overend because they feel like they are really part of the event. It's the essence of the event." (https://www.cpr.org/2022/05/26/bike-vs-train-the-story-behind-durangos-iron-horse-bicycle-classic/)

**Downtown MTB return:** "The return to racing in downtown. Mountain biking brought out plenty of fans with the start and finish in Buckley Park and the iconic run through Steamworks Brewing Co., returning for the first time in six years." Steamworks features included a "ramp into Steamworks that made it accessible and fun." (https://www.durangoherald.com/articles/ian-burnett-reflects-on-iron-horse-bicycle-classic-looks-ahead/)

**Festival atmosphere:** "A weekend celebration of cycling with, live music, beer garden, vendors and fun for all ages." Including the Face Plant Ale Kickoff Parade and a beer called "Faceplant" brewed specifically for the event. (https://www.ironhorsebicycleclassic.com/ and https://velo.outsideonline.com/news/history-iron-horse-bicycle-classic-returns-for-52nd-year)

**Local sponsorship model:** "Local sponsors means the local McDonald's franchise sponsors the aid stations, the local Coca Cola plant sponsors the road race, and an auto dealership presents the mountain bike race, along with others ranging from restaurants to a hot springs resort." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/news/history-iron-horse-bicycle-classic-returns-for-52nd-year)

**Equal prize purse:** "Burnett is proud that the IHBC pays out equally to the men's and women's fields across the weekend." Winners of the road race take home $1,000. (https://www.durangoherald.com/articles/ian-burnett-reflects-on-iron-horse-bicycle-classic-looks-ahead/ and https://www.durangoherald.com/articles/iron-horse-bicycle-classic-makes-its-return-to-downtown-durango-this-weekend/)

**Historical note on women's participation:** "Until 1979, female racers weren't allowed to go past the Purgatory Ski Resort, which is 27 miles north of Durango, because it was thought the passes were too difficult for them. Do a lot of women today ride the Iron Horse? Absolutely. Thirty percent of our rider population is female." (https://www.cpr.org/2022/05/26/bike-vs-train-the-story-behind-durangos-iron-horse-bicycle-classic/)

**Winningest rider:** "The winningest rider in the Iron Horse is Mara Abbot from Boulder, Colorado. She has won the event six times; Ned has won it five times." (https://www.cpr.org/2022/05/26/bike-vs-train-the-story-behind-durangos-iron-horse-bicycle-classic/)

**Silverton finish celebration:** "As you roll into Silverton you will be greeted by cheering crowds, vendors, food trucks and a beer garden to celebrate your huge achievement!" (https://www.ironhorsebicycleclassic.com/)

**Durango's cycling reputation:** "At the Mountain Bike World Championships in Italy, Durango kept coming up. Durango had nine athletes at the World Championships. Nine from a town of 18,000 [people]." (https://www.cpr.org/2022/05/26/bike-vs-train-the-story-behind-durangos-iron-horse-bicycle-classic/)

**Future development:** "The plan is for the IHBC to have that downtown Durango presence for the next few years until the Durango Mesa Park project is complete, then IHBC may move some larger events up there. The Durango Mesa Park project includes building a bike park, BMX race facility, dual slalom and downhill areas on 1,800 acres of land above Durango." Durango has also bid to host the UCI Mountain Bike World Championship in 2030. (https://www.durangoherald.com/articles/ian-burnett-reflects-on-iron-horse-bicycle-classic-looks-ahead/)
