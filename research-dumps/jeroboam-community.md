# JEROBOAM — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Jack Luke [COMPETITIVE]:** "At first glance, the Jeroboam 300, a new gravel race in the north of Italy, looked like the ideal weekend adventure — boasting copious amounts of wine, sun, good views and a largely off-road 300km loop that circumnavigates Lago d'Iseo near Erbusco. You can imagine why my interest was piqued when my invite landed in my inbox. However, on closer inspection the event began to reveal its true nature — tackling a dizzying 7,000m of ascent on terrain that was said to be 'unrideable' in places, the organisers of the Jeroboam quite openly admitted that they expected to have 'few finishers'." (https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/5-things-we-learnt-about-gravel-racing-at-the-jeroboam-300km)

**Jack Luke [COMPETITIVE]:** "it wasn't until after Reuben and I — BikeRadar's resident gravel divas — had fully committed to the event that we realised it started at 4pm, with riders expected to ride through the night." (https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/5-things-we-learnt-about-gravel-racing-at-the-jeroboam-300km)

**Paul Errington [ELITE]:** "As I sat and waited in the airport for the XPDTN3 guys to arrive I fired up the route on my laptop … 12,000m of climbing! I messaged Uggi from AltomCykling.dk to ask about this crazy number, he said it couldn't be right but a few minutes later confirmed his gpx reader also showed the same. We both simultaneously prayed for computational errors to be at play here." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/ride-report-jeroboam-300-italian-gravel-by-paul-errington/)

**Paul Errington [ELITE]:** "With a 16:00 start the day of the event was far more relaxed than normal. Lazy breakfast, last minute bike tweaks and then some pasta for lunch. The weather was glorious with the weather reports of heavy rain looking unlikely to come to fruition. Soon enough start time rolled around and as we waited the grey clouds gathered overhead. With the first Jeroboam stamp in our route card we started pedalling just after 16:00. Not more than a few pedal turns later the rain started, then it got heavier, then it turned to hail. Our small group of riders rode up on to the pavement and sheltered in a doorway. 0.5km in to our 300km adventure and already we were soaked." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/ride-report-jeroboam-300-italian-gravel-by-paul-errington/)

**Paul Errington [ELITE]:** "This early climb, not more than a few kilometres in length on a cobbled and rocky surface, provided opportunity for a selection of riders to be made. This saw me on the more painful side of the selection with a group obviously intent on getting back to the finish as quickly as possible. As I looked around our small group I was riding with Marcel Batlle, Christian Meier, Roc Majoral and David Koesel. I was definitely punching above my weight nestled amongst these much stronger guys. As I struggled to breathe on the climbs they chatted and ate." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/ride-report-jeroboam-300-italian-gravel-by-paul-errington/)

**Paul Errington [ELITE]:** "With no more than the first 500m ridden I was dropped, the inevitable had finally happened and instead of disappointment I was happy to now be able to settle in to my own pace and thoughts. The riding was now in the dark lit by my front light. A mixture of the exertion to get to this point and the climb itself meant I was struggling to focus as the route only ever climbed upward. Over 2 hours later the refuge acting as the second checkpoint was in sight. I had already decided that if Marc from XPDTN3 was there with his car covering the event I was done, at this time I was happy to retire. Marc was there and as I tried to outline my desire to call it a day he laughed, smiled and just pretended he hadn't heard me. Inside and after some pasta and a hot chocolate my resolve returned and I was ready to continue on." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/ride-report-jeroboam-300-italian-gravel-by-paul-errington/)

**Paul Errington [ELITE]:** "Crossing the finish line in Erbrusco some 21 hours later it was obvious that Jeroboam 300 was a serious undertaking. The climbing, course variety and timing of the riding all construed to prevent the strongest of riders from completing the full distance. Note, total climbing was around 6500m thankfully but often felt like 12,000." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/ride-report-jeroboam-300-italian-gravel-by-paul-errington/)

**Dave Arthur [RECREATIONAL]:** "I opted for the middle distance, blaming a lack of current fitness and an early flight the following morning which I was worried about missing once I learned the fastest time in 2018 was a staggering 23 hours! I was reassured that despite the lack of distance, the 150km ride would give me all the flavour of the area without the suffering. Well, less suffering anyway." (https://road.cc/offroad/content/feature/riding-and-surviving-the-jeroboam-a-tough-as-nails-gravel-race-in-italy-4258)

**Dave Arthur [RECREATIONAL]:** "By the time I had crested the top of the first of the day's big climbs, I had clocked up 1,200m of climbing in just 30km. That's a bonkers ratio of climbing to distance and hard, nay impossible, to replicate on my local trails. I now had a better idea of what the Jeroboam was all about: maximum suffering and never taking the easy option when there's a harder, steeper, rougher track to the summit." (https://road.cc/offroad/content/feature/riding-and-surviving-the-jeroboam-a-tough-as-nails-gravel-race-in-italy-4258)

**Dave Arthur [RECREATIONAL]:** "With so much climbing packed into such a short distance, it meant the gradients were severe, up to 30% in places. It was unquestionably hard going. Many times I wanted to get off and walk, but stubbornness kept me pushing the gears." (https://road.cc/offroad/content/feature/riding-and-surviving-the-jeroboam-a-tough-as-nails-gravel-race-in-italy-4258)

**Dave Arthur [RECREATIONAL]:** "After 9 hours (8 hrs 15 mins ride time; I had to stop for photos and snacks) I rolled across the finish line." (https://road.cc/offroad/content/feature/riding-and-surviving-the-jeroboam-a-tough-as-nails-gravel-race-in-italy-4258)

**Jakub Barčík [UNKNOWN]:** "It was really hard. The Jeroboam 300 Challenge says it all. I won't write about the fact that it was sometimes a steep uphill (sometimes too steep) and also really downhill. The macadam was flying through the air as we were going down the hill... Even that feeling when you have the last 20 kilometers even and all you can think about is that you want to get it over with and have a cold beer. Your body and mind will experience all this and maybe more. There's no way to convey this, either in words or pictures. You have to experience this for yourself. It was tough, it was damn tough, but we did it." (https://www.jakubbarcik.com/ride-logs/jeroboam-300-2024)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Gearing - All Levels:**
**Jack Luke [COMPETITIVE]:** "We hadn't anticipated was how much of a difference loading our bikes up with a mass of bikepacking gear would make to how they ride, particularly when riding most of the way over the Alps. There is still little excuse for this as neither of us are particular strangers to the concept of gravity, but some slightly easier gearing wouldn't have gone amiss on the bigger climbs. So for those considering riding the challenge next year, either harden up or get a bigger cassette. I suggest you go with the latter." (https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/5-things-we-learnt-about-gravel-racing-at-the-jeroboam-300km)

**Dave Arthur [RECREATIONAL]:** "I was thankful for the massive 50t sprocket on my cassette. I had been loaned a brand new 3T Exploro for the event and it was equipped with the latest SRAM wireless goodies, including an Eagle AXS rear mech and 10-50t cassette, joined to a Force 44t chainset and brake levers. Any time the road or trail headed for the sky, I was straight into the 50t and spinning my little legs away." (https://road.cc/offroad/content/feature/riding-and-surviving-the-jeroboam-a-tough-as-nails-gravel-race-in-italy-4258)

**Tires - Recreational Level:**
**Dave Arthur [RECREATIONAL]:** "The only thing I'd change, other than perhaps a smaller chainring, is to upsize the tyres. The descents were rough and tough and more cushioning from the jolting and arm pump would have been appreciated. A 50mm tyre, even a mountain bike 2.1 or 2.2in tyre would have been just lovely." (https://road.cc/offroad/content/feature/riding-and-surviving-the-jeroboam-a-tough-as-nails-gravel-race-in-italy-4258)

**Tubeless Setup - Competitive Level:**
**Jack Luke [COMPETITIVE]:** "While neither of us suffered from a single puncture during the Jeroboam — a serious stroke of luck! — I finished the event even more convinced about how vital a tubeless setup is for gravel riding. While I really enjoyed riding my 3T Exploro Ltd loaner bike, my experience would have been even better if the wheels had been set up tubeless because it would have allowed me to run far lower pressures without the fear of pinch flatting, improving comfort and traction on rough terrain. In particular, I felt held back by the tubed setup on rough gravel descents where despite being comparably skilled and using equally wide tyres, Reuben and his low-pressure tubeless setup managed to drop me with little effort." (https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/5-things-we-learnt-about-gravel-racing-at-the-jeroboam-300km)

**Emergency Repairs - All Levels:**
**Jack Luke [COMPETITIVE]:** "Less than 500m into a section of very gravel-bike-unfriendly off-camber singletrack that I aptly described at the time as 'low risk, high consequence', Reuben took a rather un-epic tumble on some rocks that managed to dislodge the rails of his saddle. After 20 minutes of two grown men shouting at an inanimate object in an oppressively humid forest, we were unable to relocate the rails into the saddle... In a stroke of — if I do say so myself — genius, I realised I could appropriate the toe straps I had used to lash my Topo Designs bar bag to my bike to hold the saddle in place. This is not the first time that toe straps have got me out of a sticky situation and I will continue to stash them in my tool roll for the rest of forever." (https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/5-things-we-learnt-about-gravel-racing-at-the-jeroboam-300km)

**Bike Choice - Recreational Level:**
**Dave Arthur [RECREATIONAL]:** "As a test of a bike like the 3T Exploro, it was perfect. A road bike would have been faster on the road climbs, but fragile on the off-road paths. A mountain bike would have been faster and more fun on the technical trails, but slower on the road. A gravel bike was the perfect compromise, not perfect anywhere but capable everywhere." (https://road.cc/offroad/content/feature/riding-and-surviving-the-jeroboam-a-tough-as-nails-gravel-race-in-italy-4258)

**Bikepacking Gear - Competitive Level:**
**Jack Luke [COMPETITIVE]:** "What we hadn't anticipated was how much of a difference loading our bikes up with a mass of bikepacking gear would make to how they ride, particularly when riding most of the way over the Alps." (https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/5-things-we-learnt-about-gravel-racing-at-the-jeroboam-300km)

**Navigation - Recreational Level:**
**Dave Arthur [RECREATIONAL]:** "Without a GPS computer, it would have been impossible to navigate the route. No arrows or Marshalls signposted the route, so navigating via the supplied GPX track on a computer or phone was essential. So it was with some alarm that I briefly rode with an Italian rider who had no computer or way of navigating at all. I found it tricky enough, due to a cornucopia of small tracks often making it tricky." (https://road.cc/offroad/content/feature/riding-and-surviving-the-jeroboam-a-tough-as-nails-gravel-race-in-italy-4258)

## Weather Experienced

**2017 Edition:**
**Paul Errington [ELITE]:** "With a 16:00 start the day of the event was far more relaxed than normal. Lazy breakfast, last minute bike tweaks and then some pasta for lunch. The weather was glorious with the weather reports of heavy rain looking unlikely to come to fruition. Soon enough start time rolled around and as we waited the grey clouds gathered overhead... Not more than a few pedal turns later the rain started, then it got heavier, then it turned to hail. Our small group of riders rode up on to the pavement and sheltered in a doorway. 0.5km in to our 300km adventure and already we were soaked. After 15 minutes the clouds looked to be lifting and the rain got lighter." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/ride-report-jeroboam-300-italian-gravel-by-paul-errington/)

**2019 Edition (150km):**
**Dave Arthur [RECREATIONAL]:** "The temperature was up to the low 20s and with just three feed-stops dotted along the route, drinking adequate water was becoming an issue." (https://road.cc/offroad/content/feature/riding-and-surviving-the-jeroboam-a-tough-as-nails-gravel-race-in-italy-4258)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Surface Variety:**
**Paul Errington [ELITE]:** "The course wasn't text book gravel riding, in fact I think it could genuinely be described as a mixed surface route. Soon after the initial selection we began to climb, this lasted for over 15km on tarmac to reach the first checkpoint at the top. Now at around 80km we then descended back down on a rocky cart track where a mountain bike would have been at home. This was a pre cursor for the routing surfaces we would generally find throughout the 300km, long tarmac climbs, rough descents, singletrack and gravel … every base had been covered here to ensure that no one rider or bike would have a distinct advantage." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/ride-report-jeroboam-300-italian-gravel-by-paul-errington/)

**Dave Arthur [RECREATIONAL]:** "The Italian event serves up a huge plethora of terrain and surfaces, from big alpine road climbs to cobbled paths, old roman roads, mountain bike trails, sweet singletrack and gravelly double track through acres of vineyards. This is about as opposite to the US idea of gravel events as you can get." (https://road.cc/offroad/content/feature/riding-and-surviving-the-jeroboam-a-tough-as-nails-gravel-race-in-italy-4258)

**Specific Technical Sections:**
**Dave Arthur [RECREATIONAL]:** "The route comprised three big climbs. They were all on the road, some main roads, others forgotten or closed roads that had fallen into disrepair, only used by local farmers, who all seem to drive Fiat Panda 4x4s. And when the road ran out, the organisers had managed to find some really rough cobbled and gravel tracks. One early road climb of a ridiculous gradient transitioned to a road resembling the Arenberg pave from Paris-Roubaix, but at 15%. It was brutal and hard going, a test of strength and perseverance." (https://road.cc/offroad/content/feature/riding-and-surviving-the-jeroboam-a-tough-as-nails-gravel-race-in-italy-4258)

**Dave Arthur [RECREATIONAL]:** "Bouncing from corner to corner, trying to pick a clean line through the rocky outcrops to avoid the risk of a flat tyre. Jiggling down old roman roads. Hopping over roots. Scaring myself silly on a warp-speed narrow track through dark woods. Arm pump on a horrendously rough old concrete road descent that I never want to see again in my life." (https://road.cc/offroad/content/feature/riding-and-surviving-the-jeroboam-a-tough-as-nails-gravel-race-in-italy-4258)

**Croce Domini Climb (300km route):**
**Paul Errington [ELITE]:** "Finally we got to the start of the big climb, at just over 20km we needed to ascend over 1500m. With no more than the first 500m ridden I was dropped, the inevitable had finally happened and instead of disappointment I was happy to now be able to settle in to my own pace and thoughts. The riding was now in the dark lit by my front light. A mixture of the exertion to get to this point and the climb itself meant I was struggling to focus as the route only ever climbed upward. Over 2 hours later the refuge acting as the second checkpoint was in sight." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/ride-report-jeroboam-300-italian-gravel-by-paul-errington/)

**Wooded Trails:**
**Paul Errington [ELITE]:** "Then to ensure total coverage of all surfaces available we took a left from the road and entered some wooded, rooty trails. The trail was signed with ribbon hung from the trees but one momentary lapse sent me in to an adjacent field requiring some bashing of undergrowth to achieve the trail again." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/ride-report-jeroboam-300-italian-gravel-by-paul-errington/)

**Franciacorta Vineyards:**
**Paul Errington [ELITE]:** "The last section of the route sent the riders through the Franciacorta region with its many vineyards. A definite change from the previous scenery. Close to the finish the 300km course joins that of the 150 and 75 routes. The route took in some rough dirt trails through the vineyards which may have been fun for the riders on the shorter courses but the punishment at this late stage was felt throughout the body." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/ride-report-jeroboam-300-italian-gravel-by-paul-errington/)

**Climbing Reality vs. Advertised:**
**Jack Luke [COMPETITIVE]:** "As an aside, the route was also advertised as having approximately 5,000m of climbing, but in the end even our curtailed 275km route topped out with a rather heady 6,300m of ascent. Given we missed out a section of the route, I hate to imagine how finishing the last few big climbs would have felt in our already weary legs!" (https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/5-things-we-learnt-about-gravel-racing-at-the-jeroboam-300km)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Course Profile Strategy - Recreational Level:**
**Dave Arthur [RECREATIONAL]:** "From studying the route profile I had gleaned the important detail that nearly all the climbing, about 3,300m, would come in the first half of the route. It was seriously weighted towards a very extreme beginning and a relatively gentle second half." (https://road.cc/offroad/content/feature/riding-and-surviving-the-jeroboam-a-tough-as-nails-gravel-race-in-italy-4258)

**Elite Group Pacing:**
**Paul Errington [ELITE]:** "Pre-event discussions of an easy paced ride had obviously been forgotten as Marcel Batlle and Christian Meier took to the front and drove the pace on until we started to catch those riders who had resisted some initial shelter. Soon our group had swelled to near 15 riders... Soon our group of riders was riding hard on cycleways and minor roads. Every so often a navigational error would fire us past our intended path so it would be all stop, turn round then build back up to speed again. This was punishing." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/ride-report-jeroboam-300-italian-gravel-by-paul-errington/)

**Mental Challenge - Elite Level:**
**Paul Errington [ELITE]:** "Now riding on my own I had the freedom of my own pace and thoughts. There is something uniquely special about riding in these early hours as you see the towns free from people and cars. As I hit the shoreline of the lake to start the return leg sunlight had once again had started to return and as darkness lifted so did my heavy eyes and heavier legs and again in the sunlight I could ride with greater ease." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/ride-report-jeroboam-300-italian-gravel-by-paul-errington/)

**Physical Toll - Elite Level (21-hour finish):**
**Paul Errington [ELITE]:** "Though my legs were still okay the time on the bike now at almost 18 hours had started to take its toll on my contact points with both my hands and feet feeling swollen and sore." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/ride-report-jeroboam-300-italian-gravel-by-paul-errington/)

**Water Management - Recreational Level:**
**Dave Arthur [RECREATIONAL]:** "The temperature was up to the low 20s and with just three feed-stops dotted along the route, drinking adequate water was becoming an issue. Fortunately, I discovered getting free water bottle refills is relatively easy in Italy, with water fountains in most parks and villages." (https://road.cc/offroad/content/feature/riding-and-surviving-the-jeroboam-a-tough-as-nails-gravel-race-in-italy-4258)

**Checkpoint Aid:**
**Paul Errington [ELITE]:** "Over 2 hours later the refuge acting as the second checkpoint was in sight. I had already decided that if Marc from XPDTN3 was there with his car covering the event I was done, at this time I was happy to retire. Marc was there and as I tried to outline my desire to call it a day he laughed, smiled and just pretended he hadn't heard me. Inside and after some pasta and a hot chocolate my resolve returned and I was ready to continue on." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/ride-report-jeroboam-300-italian-gravel-by-paul-errington/)

**Fastest Times - Elite Level:**
**Asiago 2021:** "The first to finish the 300km route was local rider Samuele Nichele, who took less than 15 hours to reach the finish line in the middle of the night." (https://3t.bike/blogs/news/two-jeroboams-japan-and-italy)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Early Selection and Dropout:**
**Paul Errington [ELITE]:** "As I looked around our small group I was riding with Marcel Batlle, Christian Meier, Roc Majoral and David Koesel. I was definitely punching above my weight nestled amongst these much stronger guys. As I struggled to breathe on the climbs they chatted and ate." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/ride-report-jeroboam-300-italian-gravel-by-paul-errington/)

**Jack Luke [COMPETITIVE]:** "Less than 500m into a section of very gravel-bike-unfriendly off-camber singletrack... Reuben took a rather un-epic tumble on some rocks that managed to dislodge the rails of his saddle. After 20 minutes of two grown men shouting at an inanimate object in an oppressively humid forest, we were unable to relocate the rails into the saddle. Unsurprisingly, this signalled the end of our attempt at completing the full route." (https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/5-things-we-learnt-about-gravel-racing-at-the-jeroboam-300km)

**Organizer Expectations:**
**Jack Luke [COMPETITIVE]:** "the organisers of the Jeroboam quite openly admitted that they expected to have 'few finishers'" (https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/5-things-we-learnt-about-gravel-racing-at-the-jeroboam-300km)

**Mental Breaking Point:**
**Paul Errington [ELITE]:** "Over 2 hours later the refuge acting as the second checkpoint was in sight. I had already decided that if Marc from XPDTN3 was there with his car covering the event I was done, at this time I was happy to retire." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/ride-report-jeroboam-300-italian-gravel-by-paul-errington/)

**Course Mishaps:**
**Jack Luke [COMPETITIVE]:** "After several minutes of stressful confusion, it became clear that a section of the route had been booked for another event... Eventually, one of the organisers of this mysterious affair said, much to our horror, we could ride up the mountain but had only 'fifteen minutes' to do so. Unaware of how long we actually had to ride, we proceeded with our 15 minute enforced time trial up the mountain and along a course littered with crash barriers and marshals, unsure whether something was about to speed up/down the course at any minute... After several kilometers, we eventually topped out at a small village where it quickly became clear that this stretch of road had been double-booked with a downhill soap-box/go-kart race." (https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/5-things-we-learnt-about-gravel-racing-at-the-jeroboam-300km)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Italian Chaos:**
**Jack Luke [COMPETITIVE]:** "Little goes to plan in Italy. As the Jeroboam 300 is in its first year, we will give 3T a little leeway regarding some of the amusing chaos we experienced during the ride." (https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/5-things-we-learnt-about-gravel-racing-at-the-jeroboam-300km)

**Event Village Atmosphere (Asiago 2021):**
"The Col del Sole staff continuously fed the grill and kept the beer dispenser to full for the riders who needed to refuel and rehydrate after their adventure." (https://3t.bike/blogs/news/two-jeroboams-japan-and-italy)

**Personal Connection:**
**Jack Luke [COMPETITIVE]:** "Despite the stress of getting two people and a bike to Italy, organising accommodation and kit for an overnight race, putting up with my considerably slower pace and dealing with a fair bit of grumping on both of our parts, Reuben and I finished the ride in good spirits with a lot of amazing memories that we won't forget anytime soon." (https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/5-things-we-learnt-about-gravel-racing-at-the-jeroboam-300km)

**Event Philosophy:**
"The Jeroboam is not a race, it's an endurance challenge. Most of the roads are very quiet, but they are shared so everybody must ride responsibly. There are aid stations along the way for food, drinks and technical support, but you should be self-sufficient." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/ride-report-jeroboam-300-italian-gravel-by-paul-errington/)

**Regional Pride:**
"Great synergy was able to fully take place. It was between 3T, which has its headquarters just over two hours by car from the Asiago plateau, the Col del Sole bike hotel which for years has been committed to spreading the cycling tourism and gravel cycling in particular and Mattia de Marchi: 3T ambassador for a few years now and member of Enough. Collective, as well as the one who personally took care of the tracing of all the routes." (https://3t.bike/blogs/news/two-jeroboams-japan-and-italy)

**Distance Options Philosophy:**
"The event offers a choice of routes all starting on Saturday morning: 75, 150 and a fearsome 300km. They're not distances plucked at random, instead they match the size of sparkling wine bottles the region is famous for. A Jeroboam is a massive 3-litre bottle, a Magnum is 1.5 litres for the 150km, and a standard bottle is 750ml, matching the 75km."
