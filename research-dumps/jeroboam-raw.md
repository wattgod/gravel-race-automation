# JEROBOAM GRAVEL SERIES - COMPREHENSIVE RESEARCH DUMP

**Research Date:** January 12, 2026
**Event Type:** Ultra-Endurance Gravel Challenge
**Location:** Franciacorta, Italy (NOT California - see clarification below)

---

## CRITICAL CLARIFICATION

**IMPORTANT:** The Jeroboam is NOT a California wine country race. It is an Italian gravel series organized by 3T Bikes, with its flagship event held in the Franciacorta sparkling wine region of Lombardy, Italy (between Milan and Lake Garda). The event name derives from wine culture - specifically the Jeroboam wine bottle size (3 liters) - but the race takes place in Italy's premier sparkling wine region, not Sonoma/Napa.

The user may have been thinking of:
- The Gravel & Wine series (California - Temecula, Paso Robles, Warner Springs)
- The Bovine Classic (Atascadero, CA wine country)
- Wine Country Century (Sonoma, CA)

## BLACK PILL

### The Brutal Truths

**1. This is NOT Really a "Gravel Race"**
- Despite the gravel marketing, it's more like an ultra-endurance MTB event
- Sections are literally unrideable - hike-a-bike required
- The terrain mix is devastating: alpine climbs, Roman cobbles, MTB singletrack, loose rock
- "It averaged out to gravel" is the cope - this is harder than advertised

**2. The Numbers Don't Lie**
- 300km with 7,000m climbing = insane ratio
- First 30km has 1,200m of climbing
- Up to 30% gradients
- Fastest finisher needs 20+ hours
- Many take 30-40 hours
- Organisers OPENLY ADMIT they expect "few finishers"

**3. Night Riding is Mandatory**
- 300km starts at 4-6pm specifically to force night riding
- You WILL ride through complete darkness
- Missing the stunning views while exhausted in the dark
- Battery management becomes critical
- Navigation harder in dark

**4. The Weather Will Betray You**
- October in northern Italy = rain is likely
- Wet rocks, roots, and gravel become treacherous
- Thunder storms have hit during events
- Cold, wet night riding is miserable
- "Weather added unpredictable layer" - race report euphemism for suffering

**5. It's International, Not Cheap**
- Flights to Italy from US
- EUR 100+ registration
- Accommodation in wine country area
- Multi-day commitment
- Not a casual weekend event

**6. The 600km Mathusalem is Insane**
- 14,500m of climbing
- Intended for "most expert riders"
- New in 2025 - limited data on completion rates
- This is approaching Transcontinental territory

**7. Equipment Demands**
- Tubeless is essentially mandatory
- Need proper lights with long battery life
- Wider tires than typical gravel (40mm+ minimum)
- Many riders wish they had MTB instead of gravel bike

**8. You're Racing the Clock**
- 24 hour cutoff
- Gates at aid stations based on 15km/h average
- Miss a gate = DNF
- The course difficulty makes maintaining average very hard

**9. The "Non-Competitive" Framing is a Lie**
- "Not a race" but there's timing, cutoffs, and results
- "Ride together" but you're alone in the dark at 3am
- The suffer is very real regardless of how it's marketed

**10. DNF Shame is Real**
- Given how hard it is, DNF rate is presumably high
- Organisers expect "few finishers"
- Public results mean everyone knows
