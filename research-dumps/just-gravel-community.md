## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Bluegrass Endurance blogger [UNKNOWN]:** "Let me start by saying the Gravel Worlds Weekend was a great one - even if my ride did not go as I wanted, not many have lately, but as I will reflect on it I 'feel' that way because I tend to be too hard on myself and I see it as not as good a pair of races as I expected." (https://bluegrassendurance.blogspot.com/2025/08/2025-gravew-worlds-12-double-race.html)

**Bluegrass Endurance blogger [UNKNOWN]:** "My final time was 2:11:48 for an 8:29/mile average [for the 25K run]. Considering my back issues and lack of sleep I was happy with that... For the ride I ended up 175 OA/572 and 24th/67 in the 60-69 AG." (https://bluegrassendurance.blogspot.com/2025/08/2025-gravew-worlds-12-double-race.html)

**Spencer Powlison [ELITE]:** "If we want to be truthful, we need to admit the mud was worse in 2015. This is not my attempt to insert myself into the gravel beef, nor do I want to cast shade on anybody. But it's the truth. I remember having snowshoes of mud and prairie grass stuck to my feet. I could barely lift my feet – it was f***ed." (https://dirtdispatch.substack.com/p/the-four-kinds-of-gravel-races-that)

**Dan Hughes [ELITE]:** "In 2009 we went North for the first time and the humidity was high and people were just laying by the side of the road, cooked. There wasn't any weather, it was just hot... There is no way to understate how tough the race was, depending on where you were in the time curve, you were either ahead of it or behind it."

**Haley Smith [ELITE]:** "I sincerely hope that this will be the hardest physical and mental challenge I will ever complete. That was simply… insane. Carnage. I am a broken woman," said mountain bike Olympian Haley Smith after the 2023 edition.

**Rebecca Rusch [ELITE]:** "In previous years the typical rider was more of an adventurous rider at heart. Now, there are a lot of new people coming into gravel, which is amazing, but maybe they don't have the same experience as those earlier gravel riders had."

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Bluegrass Endurance [UNKNOWN, 60-69 age group]:** Used Capital Gravel Bike with SRAM Red XPLR 10-46 13SP 1X w/46 Front Chainring (noted using Force Cranks and Wolf Tooth Chain rings), New SRAM Red XPLR Brakes, Zipp 303 XPLR S Wheels, Rene Herse Oracle Ridge Endurance + (48mm tires). "With regard to gearing I have two chainrings - 42 & 46 - and figured as while there is a good amount of vert it is mostly rolling hills with a few short steeper ones." (https://bluegrassendurance.blogspot.com/2025/08/2025-gravew-worlds-12-double-race.html)

**Dan Hughes [ELITE]:** "When I rode the San Diego BWR in 2018... I rode 32mm file-tread tires and felt that was a great compromise for the generally fast and smooth terrain. Some were so bold as to run 30mm road tires." (https://dirtdispatch.substack.com/p/the-four-kinds-of-gravel-races-that)

**Yuri Hauswald [ELITE]:** On mud handling: "You surf the edges, you walk in the tall grass, you keep it wet and that does enough to keep some of the mud off of it. A positive attitude is what gets you through it." (https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/a-celebration-of-tenacity-legends-of-unbound-gravel-defend-its-difficulty-and-revisit-its-gnarliest-editions)

## Weather Experienced

**2023 Unbound Gravel:** Featured significant mud that slowed the race to a crawl. "The sticky clay mixture clogged many bikes almost immediately, rendering them unrideable." However, Kristi Mohn noted: "If you want my honest opinion, the weather [in 2023] was nice – it is the heat that scares the shit out of me." (https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/a-celebration-of-tenacity-legends-of-unbound-gravel-defend-its-difficulty-and-revisit-its-gnarliest-editions)

**2015 Unbound Gravel:** Yuri Hauswald: "The mud was worse in 2015... I remember having snowshoes of mud and prairie grass stuck to my feet." (https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/a-celebration-of-tenacity-legends-of-unbound-gravel-defend-its-difficulty-and-revisit-its-gnarliest-editions)

**2009 Unbound Gravel:** Dan Hughes described extreme heat conditions: "The humidity was high and people were just laying by the side of the road, cooked." Kristi Mohn added: "The last heat year we had was 2009, and the winner's finishing time barely beat the sun and he was a great athlete. The finish rate was 14% and the time was well over 14 hours... when the real feel is over 100 the temperature is crushing." (https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/a-celebration-of-tenacity-legends-of-unbound-gravel-defend-its-difficulty-and-revisit-its-gnarliest-editions)

**2025 Gravel Worlds:** Bluegrass Endurance reported: "For starters the weather was an unknown as going into the week it had been hot, very hot, and humid but the forecast was for cooling on Saturday - the day of the ride - and that thankfully happened... Friday night - when the 300 Mile race was to start - a storm rolled through which delayed the 300... and put down some rain and in the process created muddy MMRs (Minimum Maintenance Roads)." The weather Saturday was described as "great as while it got warm it was not hot and for the 78 was even had a cool breeze at times." (https://bluegrassendurance.blogspot.com/2025/08/2025-gravew-worlds-12-double-race.html)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Grizedale Forest (JUST.GRAVEL UK):** Official event info describes "ALL COURSES ARE ON WIDE, WELL-SURFACED GRAVEL TRAILS - OFFERING SMOOTH RIDING​ THAT IS IDEALLY SUITED TO GRAVEL OR OFF-ROAD BIKES. THE TWO LONGER ROUTES HAVE A VERY SHORT SECTION OF LINKING ROAD." Course distances: 15km family route, 32km fun ride, 45km challenge. Located in "GRIZEDALE FOREST, HAWKSHEAD, LA22 0QJ" in the southern Lake District. (https://www.justgravel.co.uk/event-info)

**Gravel Worlds 2025 Course [UNKNOWN rider perspective]:** "The first 15 miles were basically up hill over a number of the endless rollers we would see for the day." Six main MMR (Minimum Maintenance Road) sections, each about a mile long. First MMR at 15.3 miles "was not too bad if not a little slow as was sticky." Main aid station at mile 46.2 was "abut the low point of the course elevation wise which meant a climb out. Really enjoy it when there is an aid station right before a climb - NOT." MMRs at 49.6 and 55.5+ miles "were pretty dry and sorta fun to ride." Dirt road at 42.6 miles "was not listed as an MMR but was just like one." (https://bluegrassendurance.blogspot.com/2025/08/2025-gravew-worlds-12-double-race.html)

**Spencer Powlison [ELITE] on Unbound:** "I love covering all of that ground, and there's something special about being out in the wide-open plains with nothing for miles... I did this Kansas classic in 2019, and it is overwhelming how far out into the middle of nowhere you can venture on those rough gravel roads. That year we had a tailwind in the final 20 miles to town, mercifully. However, the terrain is always difficult with undulating climbs that are deceptively steep." (https://dirtdispatch.substack.com/p/the-four-kinds-of-gravel-races-that)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Bluegrass Endurance** [UNKNOWN] **(60-69 AG):** "Was not feeling bad but just not peppy however knew I was going to try and put in a bigger effort over the last 20 miles or so... to see if I could pick up any places and appeared to do so as started catching people... Over the last 20+ miles based on the splits GW supplied I picked up 30 places and averaged a good pace." His Normalized Power was 213W for the ride (compared to previous races at 198W and 200W). Total ride time appears to have been around 5-6 hours for 78 miles. (https://bluegrassendurance.blogspot.com/2025/08/2025-gravew-worlds-12-double-race.html)

**Note on race format discussion:** Multiple sources discuss safety concerns around mass starts and open-road racing. One proposal gaining traction is the "enduro format" - timing discrete segments with flaggers while letting the rest be untimed riding. This would "capture the racing element here and let the rest be riding, with no results penalty for say, stopping at a stop sign, or taking a downhill more cautiously." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/the-future-of-gravel-racing/95739)

## DNF Risk Factors

**2023 Unbound mud conditions:** "The sticky clay mixture clogged many bikes almost immediately, rendering them unrideable. Worse than losing a race position or two, there were riders crashing, derailleurs being ripped off, broken frames, and all-around carnage." Nathan Haas argued that "no bike company designs bikes to be able to handle those conditions." (https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/a-celebration-of-tenacity-legends-of-unbound-gravel-defend-its-difficulty-and-revisit-its-gnarliest-editions)

**2009 Unbound heat:** Finish rate was only 14% with winner's time "well over 14 hours" in extreme heat conditions. (https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/a-celebration-of-tenacity-legends-of-unbound-gravel-defend-its-difficulty-and-revisit-its-gnarliest-editions)

**Gravel racing safety concerns broadly:** Discussion on TrainerRoad forum highlighted: "As fields in gravel get even faster, more competitive, faster. Safety seems like an ever growing challenge with open roads. Multiple events this year have seen incidents with cars... Someone is inevitably going to get hurt or killed at a major race." The Robidoux race in Nebraska was put on hold with organizer saying he thought a "reckoning" was coming in gravel related to safety. Gravel Worlds incident mentioned where riders came "inches away from total disaster." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/the-future-of-gravel-racing/95739)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Kristi Mohn (Unbound co-director):** "We shouldn't be detracting from those who got it done, especially because there are positive lessons in not finishing... We have the legend of 2015, the year of the mud, and as frustrated as people were, it turned into a celebration of tenacity and we missed an opportunity to celebrate overcoming adversity. Everyone is facing the same obstacles, the only difference is in the duration and what you can handle with your ability. It lets you connect with bigger ways to be connected with other athletes because everyone goes through it. That adversity is what gives a shared perspective." (https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/a-celebration-of-tenacity-legends-of-unbound-gravel-defend-its-difficulty-and-revisit-its-gnarliest-editions)

**Rebecca Rusch [ELITE]:** "When I did Unbound for the first time there weren't any pros, there were just people who wanted to complete the 200 miles." On the evolution: "I also think people are really pushing the equipment to get that performance gain... People are now pushing to be as light and fast as they can." (https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/a-celebration-of-tenacity-legends-of-unbound-gravel-defend-its-difficulty-and-revisit-its-gnarliest-editions)

**JUST.GRAVEL UK event philosophy:** Event website emphasizes inclusivity: "WE OFFER GUARANTEED PLACES FOR FAMILIES AND WOMEN. WE OFFER A 'ONE CHILD RIDES FREE PER ADULT' OPTION... WE OFFER LIMITED NUMBERS OF 'ASSISTED' ENTRIES FOR THOSE ON LOW/LIMITED INCOME." The events are described as "NOT RACES" but rather "an opportunity to get started with gravel riding" for Family and Fun courses. (https://www.justgravel.co.uk/event-info)

**Spencer Powlison [ELITE] on gravel categories:** Defined four types of gravel events: "Corn-Fed Gravel" (flat/rolling prairie, 100+ miles, wind and heat), "Roadie Gravel" (smoother, faster, more pavement), "Mountain Gravel" (thousands of feet climbing, dicey roads), and "Wild Card Gravel" (creative formats, unusual timing). Notes that "organizers bring a ton of creativity to the table. Now more than ever, they need to stand out." (https://dirtdispatch.substack.com/p/the-four-kinds-of-gravel-races-that)
