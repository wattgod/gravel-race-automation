# KAL-TOUR DIRTY 100 — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Critical Finding: Wrong Event

**IMPORTANT:** The sources provided contain **zero information** about "Kal-Tour Dirty 100" as a gravel/cycling race. 

The sources are actually about:

1. **"The Dirty 100"** - A motocross/amateur dirt bike racing points series (Sources 1-3: dirty100.com, resultsmx.com)
   - Features races at tracks like Daytona, Loretta Lynn's, Mini O's
   - Scoring system for youth motocross classes (51cc, 65cc, 85cc bikes)
   - No connection to gravel cycling

2. **Other gravel races** - Multiple sources discuss gravel cycling events like:
   - Dirty Kanza/Unbound Gravel (Kansas)
   - Belgian Waffle Ride (California)
   - Barry-Roubaix (Michigan)
   - Mid South (Oklahoma)
   - Dirty Pecan (Texas)
   - Dirty South Roubaix
   
3. **Unrelated Reddit threads** - About arcade machines, raw denim, AR-15 rifles, and The 100 TV show

**No "Kal-Tour Dirty 100" gravel race exists in these sources.**

## Possible Explanations

1. **Name confusion** - You may be thinking of one of these actual gravel races:
   - Dirty Kanza 100 (now Unbound Gravel 100)

   - Various other "Dirty" branded gravel events

2. **Motocross series** - "The Dirty 100" is exclusively a youth motocross points ranking system
