# KARUKINKA — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Jorge Padrones [COMPETITIVE]:** "After a 13-hour flight to Santiago, you still have another flight of more than 3 hours in length to get to Punta Arenas. This is a long way from Europe all the way south. From there, once we met the rest of the riders and crew we took a minibus on another 8-hour trip to the start of our race at Villa Cameron." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/armchair-adventure-karukinka-gravel)

**Jorge Padrones [COMPETITIVE]:** "As soon as we were outside Villa Cameron, which was just one minute into the race, the race mode was on! Straight away there was a nasty climb in which we could see the first attacks and the racing kicked off." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/armchair-adventure-karukinka-gravel)

**Jorge Padrones [COMPETITIVE]:** "We crossed a steppe with no vegetation, but with some wind, one of the protagonists of the Patagonian weather which very often blows at over 100 km/h." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/armchair-adventure-karukinka-gravel)

**Jorge Padrones [COMPETITIVE]:** "Next morning we woke up to see that it had been snowing all night. The weather in this part of the world is very unpredictable and variable, so the organisation took a wise decision delaying the start by one hour so the warmer temperatures could do their work and melt the snow." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/armchair-adventure-karukinka-gravel)

**Jorge Padrones [COMPETITIVE]:** "In Caleta Maria there was space for only 50-60 people including the crew. This is one of the reasons that this event will never be massive and only those 50 people per year will be the lucky ones who get to enjoy this unique experience." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/armchair-adventure-karukinka-gravel)

**Antonio Ortiz [UNKNOWN]:** "The wind, one of the cyclist's greatest enemies, often blowing head-on, pushes fiercely and seems to snatch away any hope of reaching the destination. The cloudy skies clear momentarily, revealing mountains that seem touched by the hand of the gods. The terrain is unpredictable: endless unpaved tracks, as they call them there, stretch on kilometer after kilometer, each view more stunning than the last." (https://www.bhbikes.com/en_GB/stories/gravelxr/antonio-ortiz-karukinka-gravel-race)

**Antonio Ortiz [UNKNOWN]:** "Each of the four stages was a challenge in itself. From the start at Villa Camerón, through Lago Blanco, Caleta María, and Pampa Guanaco, the Patagonian geography revealed all its rawness and beauty." (https://www.bhbikes.com/en_GB/stories/gravelxr/antonio-ortiz-karukinka-gravel-race)

**Pan Yamboonruang [RECREATIONAL]:** "An hour into the ride, icy droplets began hitting our gloves and helmets, soon escalating into a hail shower. Despite the punishing weather, the scenery was breathtaking: endless gravel roads winding through grasslands, framed by icy peaks on the horizon." (https://colombici.cc/journal/finding-myself)

**Pan Yamboonruang [RECREATIONAL]:** "My first instinct was to fight back, matching its force with sheer determination. I was churning out far too many watts, only to crawl along at 13 km/h. Frustration built with each stroke, every flat stretch feeling like an uphill battle." (https://colombici.cc/journal/finding-myself)

**Pan Yamboonruang [RECREATIONAL]:** "The wind wasn't going to stop. Fighting it was a losing game, draining my energy and feeding my frustration. It was time to let go of the fight and adapt instead... That shift in mindset changed everything. In surrender, clarity emerged." (https://colombici.cc/journal/finding-myself)

**Pan Yamboonruang [RECREATIONAL]:** "I found myself riding with a group of three Chilean engineers who had been cycling friends since college. Their positive energy was contagious, and I felt welcomed immediately. We took turns pulling at the front or hiding from the wind, building camaraderie as we rode." (https://colombici.cc/journal/finding-myself)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**[RECREATIONAL] Pan Yamboonruang:** Started Stage 1 on a borrowed CX bike "two sizes too small" after his bike didn't arrive with his flight. Notes: "Loose gravel slid under my rear tire, demanding constant focus. While it wasn't as technical as the gravel I'd faced in Colombia, it still tested my nerves, especially on a rental bike." (https://colombici.cc/journal/finding-myself)

**Sleeping gear required [ALL LEVELS]:** Official race briefing states competitors must bring their own sleeping bags and tents, though the organization transports them. "Albergue municipal" (hostel) accommodations available but still require sleeping bag. Alternative cabin/hostal upgrades available at some stages. (https://karukinkagravelrace.com/)

**Capacity allowance [ALL LEVELS]:** Organization provides truck transport with "100 lts capacity per competitor" for gear bags during all stages. (https://karukinkagravelrace.com/)

## Weather Experienced

**December 2024 event [COMPETITIVE Jorge Padrones]:** "Next morning we woke up to see that it had been snowing all night" at Lago Blanco. Organization delayed Stage 2 start by one hour to allow snow to melt. "Weather conditions can change rapidly in Tierra de Fuego and you need to be prepared for everything, it can get very cold and snow or it can get warm and sunny with big temperature and condition changes over very short periods of time." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/armchair-adventure-karukinka-gravel)

**December 2024 event [RECREATIONAL Pan Yamboonruang]:** "An hour into the ride, icy droplets began hitting our gloves and helmets, soon escalating into a hail shower." Stage 1 conditions. (https://colombici.cc/journal/finding-myself)

**Late December arrival [RECREATIONAL Pan Yamboonruang]:** "The flight from Santiago to Punta Arenas landed late, near midnight. Yet somehow, the sky was still glowing; a surreal sunset at almost 11 p.m." Summer conditions with extreme daylight hours. Immediately faced "frostbiting wind" when stepping outside airport. (https://colombici.cc/journal/finding-myself)

**Summer daylight [COMPETITIVE Jorge Padrones]:** "The days eternal of December that begin at 04 am and finish at 23 hours." Approximately 19 hours of daylight during race period. (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/armchair-adventure-karukinka-gravel)

**Wind conditions [COMPETITIVE Jorge Padrones]:** "We crossed a steppe with no vegetation, but with some wind, one of the protagonists of the Patagonian weather which very often blows at over 100 km/h." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/armchair-adventure-karukinka-gravel)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Stage 1 start [COMPETITIVE Jorge Padrones]:** "As soon as we were outside Villa Cameron, which was just one minute into the race, the race mode was on! Straight away there was a nasty climb in which we could see the first attacks and the racing kicked off." 98 km with 800m ascent. "The last 10 km of the stage were beautiful as we got into a forest with small trees and the track had many twists and turns making it more exciting to ride." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/armchair-adventure-karukinka-gravel)

**Stage 2 Queen Stage [COMPETITIVE Jorge Padrones]:** "114 kms with approximately 2000 meters of accumulated climbing. A hard mountain stage." Route crosses "a huge mountain range with two long climbs" and "endless forests and peaks on a track full of hairpins" to reach Caleta María - literally "the end of the road." "When you arrive, you could see a sign saying 'End of the Road' but it is not just the end of that road, it is the end of the roads in this part of the world." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/armchair-adventure-karukinka-gravel)

**Stage 3 exclusive section [COMPETITIVE Jorge Padrones]:** Chilean army opened "around 10 kms of road built that were not yet open to the public" for the race. "We were the first ones to cycle on that road which went into deep valleys surrounded by glaciers, something really magnificent. We were told they build around 1 km per year of road." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/armchair-adventure-karukinka-gravel)

**Overall route [COMPETITIVE Jorge Padrones]:** "Basically, the race followed the Y-85 road, the one and only one on the area, built by the Chilean army to show sovereignty of the land on this part of Tierra de Fuego." Return from Caleta María follows same route in reverse "for one reason - there is no other way." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/armchair-adventure-karukinka-gravel)

**Surface conditions [RECREATIONAL Pan Yamboonruang]:** "Loose gravel slid under my rear tire, demanding constant focus. While it wasn't as technical as the gravel I'd faced in Colombia, it still tested my nerves, especially on a rental bike." (https://colombici.cc/journal/finding-myself)

**Wildlife encounters [COMPETITIVE Jorge Padrones]:** "To our surprise, we were lucky to have a special guest welcoming us on our arrival. There was a family of King Penguins (who are not very common in this place), so it was just perfect." At Caleta María finish. Also mentions guanacos throughout the route. (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/armchair-adventure-karukinka-gravel)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Headwind pacing adaptation [RECREATIONAL Pan Yamboonruang]:** Initially fought the wind: "I was churning out far too many watts, only to crawl along at 13 km/h. Frustration built with each stroke, every flat stretch feeling like an uphill battle." After adapting mindset: "The wind wasn't going to stop. Fighting it was a losing game, draining my energy and feeding my frustration. It was time to let go of the fight and adapt instead... I stopped resisting and began to embrace the unsettling silence, taking each stroke as it came, moment by moment." (https://colombici.cc/journal/finding-myself)

**Group riding benefits [RECREATIONAL Pan Yamboonruang]:** "I found myself riding with a group of three Chilean engineers who had been cycling friends since college... We took turns pulling at the front or hiding from the wind, building camaraderie as we rode." Essential for wind management. (https://colombici.cc/journal/finding-myself)

**Elite pacing [COMPETITIVE Jorge Padrones]:** "I thought we would be starting at a pace that we would be able to maintain, before later speeding up, but it wasn't like that. As soon as we were outside Villa Cameron, which was just one minute into the race, the race mode was on!" Racing started immediately with attacks on the first climb. (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/armchair-adventure-karukinka-gravel)

**Race format note [ELITE Robert Gesink participation]:** Ex-pro riders Robert Gesink and Jetse Bol participated in 2024 edition. Gesink had "retired from his professional cycling career after the 2024 Vuelta a España" and participated December 2024.

## DNF Risk Factors

**Bike logistics failure [RECREATIONAL Pan Yamboonruang]:** Major risk factor - bike didn't arrive on connecting flight to Punta Arenas. "My bike hadn't made the connecting flight. I panicked! Without my bike, how could I even start the race?" Was able to borrow bike from MTB Patagonia organization for Stage 1. Local staff said bike would arrive "on the first flight the next morning" but didn't make the 5-hour bus departure. (https://colombici.cc/journal/finding-myself)

**Mental challenges [RECREATIONAL Pan Yamboonruang]:** "Hours of suffering pulled me into dark places, filled with illogical thoughts and constant self-doubt. Why am I here? Am I too ambitious? Will I even finish?" The "silence and stillness were disturbing. They made me feel small and exposed." (https://colombici.cc/journal/finding-myself)

**Weather unpredictability [COMPETITIVE Jorge Padrones]:** Overnight snow before Stage 2 required start delay. "Weather conditions can change rapidly in Tierra de Fuego and you need to be prepared for everything, it can get very cold and snow or it can get warm and sunny with big temperature and condition changes over very short periods of time." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/armchair-adventure-karukinka-gravel)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Intimate field size [COMPETITIVE Jorge Padrones]:** "In Caleta Maria there was space for only 50-60 people including the crew. This is one of the reasons that this event will never be massive and only those 50 people per year will be the lucky ones who get to enjoy this unique experience. This event has born to be a boutique small event for just the lucky ones." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/armchair-adventure-karukinka-gravel)

**Community living [COMPETITIVE Jorge Padrones]:** "From that day we (all the race participants and the crew) started to live as a community as we shared the meals and the space where we slept. Among the participants we had some professional riders, although they were turning into ex-pros in just a few days, Robert Gesink and Jetse Bol. During the race though there were no distinctions and they were part of the race community sharing with the rest of the participants." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/armchair-adventure-karukinka-gravel)

**Accommodations [COMPETITIVE Jorge Padrones]:** Villa Cameron start: "shared the communal gym to spend the night on portable beds with our sleeping bag." Lago Blanco: "a small lodge with some cabins for the fishermen... We again shared a dining room to sleep - this time with a beautiful view over the lake, the mountains and the sky... while we had a nice wood fire to keep us warm." Caleta María: "nothing more than a couple of privately owned houses... just two houses that the owner lent to the organisation so we could spend the night there sharing a loft and some rooms. It was a very basic setup, but it was warm." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/armchair-adventure-karukinka-gravel)

**Local interaction [COMPETITIVE Jorge Padrones]:** "Next morning after a good breakfast, some protocol ceremony with the local authorities and spending some time with the kids from the village we started the first stage." At Caleta María: "Don Julio, the owner, is a cycling enthusiast and pioneer in the Straits of Magellan region. In the evening there was a campfire in which Don Julio told us stories about the place... Don Julio, who was almost 70 years old, was supposed to start riding the next stage with us, but instead of just doing the first kilometres he went all the way and finished the longest and hardest stage with us!" (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/armchair-adventure-karukinka-gravel)

**Post-race celebration [UNKNOWN Antonio Ortiz]:** "And in the end, the reward: a slow-cooked barbecue on lenga wood, surrounded by cyclists sharing stories of fatigue and triumph, but also of friendship. That is the true essence of the Karukinka Gravel Race: a challenge of endurance but also a connection with nature and other cyclists in a place like few others in the world." (https://www.bhbikes.com/en_GB/stories/gravelxr/antonio-ortiz-karukinka-gravel-race)

**Race catering [ALL LEVELS]:** Official registration includes: "Desayunos, almuerzos y cenas en cada una de las etapas" (breakfasts, lunches, dinners at each stage), "Puestos de hidratación y abastecimientos en las 4 etapas" (hydration and supply stations on all 4 stages), "Asado de Premiación 12 de diciembre" (awards barbecue). Chef Jose mentioned providing hot soup at stage finishes. (https://karukinkagravelrace.com/)

**Local hospitality [RECREATIONAL Pan Yamboonruang]:** After bike bag panic: "The ground staff patiently reassured me my bike would arrive on the first flight the next morning. The local driver immediately offered to help. We communicated in Spanglish, and he promised to take me to a bike shop to rent one or pick up my bag from the airport when it arrived. 'Tranquilo,' he said. 'In Patagonia, we always find a way.'" Notes the paradox: "a place so unforgiving in its natural elements yet softened by the warmth of its people."
