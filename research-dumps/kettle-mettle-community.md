**lukejt [UNKNOWN]:** Posted asking about October weather preparation for the 100km route, planning for "10-15 degrees and that light drizzly rain we start to get in the fall," questioning whether "a water resistant cycling wind breaker and tights and some bags in my shoes" would be sufficient or if they'd "be miserable after the first few KMs." (https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouvercycling/comments/4worr1/kettle_mettle_weather/)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**General guidance from race description [SOURCE LEVEL: Official]:** "While the most common bikes at the event are gravel or cyclo-cross, some participants choose to ride mountain, road, touring, or hybrids.

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**From race narrative [RECREATIONAL]:** "The trail began with a gentle ascent, lulling participants into a false sense of ease. But soon, the gravel beneath their tires became coarse, and the path ahead grew steeper. The relentless climb through the dry, rocky hills demanded strength and stamina." (https://www.adventurebc.com/articles-and-adventure/kettle-mettle-gravel-fondo-a-gritty-ride-through-bcs-history)

**Course technical details [Official]:** "The majority of the Dirty Fondo takes place on the Kettle Valley Railway Trail (KVR) and features a maximum 2.2% grade 'Railway Grade', and the trail can be cycled for most fitness levels although the faster you go the harder the effort is." The course "goes through Myra Canyon Provincial Park which features 17 amazing trestles and there is also several tunnels."

**Tunnels described [RECREATIONAL]:** "Midway through the course, riders passed through tunnels carved into the mountains, dark and cool, a welcome reprieve from the hot sun. The echo of tires against the gravel and the crunch of stones beneath wheels added to the sense of adventure." (https://www.adventurebc.com/articles-and-adventure/kettle-mettle-gravel-fondo-a-gritty-ride-through-bcs-history)

The day ended much like it began—with laughter, camaraderie, and a shared love of cycling, adventure, and the stunning landscapes that make British Columbia such a treasure."
