## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

### ASVÖ King of the Lake TT (Austria)

**Daniel Hochstraßer [ELITE]:** "Everyone had high hopes for me, which was quite a lot of pressure. But I managed to turn it into positive energy. At the beginning, I didn't feel that fast, but halfway through, I realized it was possible. I'm happy that I could really deliver my maximum performance on the day. I've celebrated quite a few successes this year, but nothing was as beautiful as winning here in front of friends, family, and my club... That was by far the most beautiful victory I have ever had the pleasure to celebrate." (https://bikeboard.cc/eng/king-of-the-lake-2024-review-th11098)

**Alexandra Krenmayr [ELITE]:** "This is such a cool race, I can recommend participation to everyone. This is my fifth time starting, and it has always been my dream to sit on the throne here!" (https://bikeboard.cc/eng/king-of-the-lake-2024-review-th11098)

**dr.hannibal [ELITE] (BB reporter):** "The organization is really top-notch, there's nothing to criticize. From the parking lots to the distribution of start numbers, to the culinary offerings in the festival tent and the coffees. There's even a Billa in the immediate vicinity. And there's an expo area where a lot of wicked gear, really cool stuff, is on display, or you can snag a bargain or two." (https://bikeboard.cc/eng/king-of-the-lake-2024-review-th11098)

**dr.hannibal [ELITE]:** "My start time was 16:03, but before that, I had to get the bike ready, get dressed, and warm up on the rollers. Lining up ten minutes before the start is enough - professional conditions, of course! Shortly before it's your turn, you climb the stairs to the starting ramp and take your assigned place. You're held for clipping into the pedal, then a countdown begins - and off you go! Thanks to the starting ramp, you can start right away with the big chainring and pick up speed quite well. Some have a lot of respect for the ramp, after all, people have already crashed there. One girl even said that once the ramp is conquered, the rest is easy." (https://bikeboard.cc/eng/king-of-the-lake-2024-review-th11098)

**dr.hannibal [ELITE]:** "The closed road with the incredible scenery is really mega awesome, especially since the weather was perfect again this year. With little wind, there are no excuses. The first half is rather flat or flows smoothly. On the return trip, some hills begin that can really hurt - once even a 13° incline, but luckily only briefly. From there, it's about 5 km to the finish, and it's all in!!! Unfortunately, I just missed my target time of 1:08 hours. 1:09:03 was what my Garmin 840 showed at the end, but also 383 meters of elevation gain. No wonder it took me longer if I have to ride 100 more meters of elevation than everyone else ;-)!" (https://bikeboard.cc/eng/king-of-the-lake-2024-review-th11098)

### BMCC King of the Lake (North Carolina MTB)

**Guard [UNKNOWN] (race organizer):** "Made a few runs this evening. Course is in awesome shape! Even if we get a little rain it will still be good, maybe even bit a little better." (https://ridemonkey.com/threads/bmcc-king-of-the-lake-nc-state-super-d-series-race-2-may-18th.257618/)

**Guard [UNKNOWN]:** "Just received an update from the Rangers: Trails are closed because in some places they are 3 feet under the flooded lake. We will give them two days to dry out after the water recedes below them today. It is looking like we will open all trails on Sunday Morning." (https://ridemonkey.com/threads/bmcc-king-of-the-lake-nc-state-super-d-series-race-2-may-18th.257618/)

**Guard [UNKNOWN]:** "It will be the same course as last time. It starts on the Core trail at the top, cuts into a small section that's not on the map that connects down into #6 and finishes on the walking track. It's pretty fun and flowy...weather is still looking good too!" (https://ridemonkey.com/threads/bmcc-king-of-the-lake-nc-state-super-d-series-race-2-may-18th.257618/)

**Guard [UNKNOWN]:** "Yeah I'm going out Friday morning to tape everything off. The ride around for the jumps will be left open for XC riders until Saturday morning. All jumps will be required but all can be rolled." (https://ridemonkey.com/threads/bmcc-king-of-the-lake-nc-state-super-d-series-race-2-may-18th.257618/)
