# KING PRICE RACE TO SUN — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Hayley Preen [ELITE]:** "It was a long day, but we worked well together. I'm happy to feel strong on the bike again and come away with the win" (https://racetothesun.co.za/honeycomb226ers_dominate/)

**Cherise Willeit [ELITE]:** "I'm really disappointed, it's been a long time since I've been in a position to win a Faces event. I gave everything, but today wasn't my day." (https://racetothesun.co.za/honeycomb226ers_dominate/)

**Marc Pritzen [ELITE]:** "You need the team to disrupt the chase and help you maintain a gap. Without them, the bunch can catch you much faster. There wasn't as much tar this year, which made it easier to control the gap. The gravel and climbing sections were tough, but they broke up the rhythm of the bunch." (https://racetothesun.co.za/honeycomb226ers_dominate/)

**Anonymous rider [RECREATIONAL]:** "Scenery was indescribable but the route was super tough to say the least - a hard day in the saddle!" (https://racetothesea.co.za)

**Anonymous rider [RECREATIONAL]:** "What an awesome race. The organising of the race was so well done. The arrival at the start, the markings of the course, the marshals along the way, very professionally done. The feeding and hydration stations were all very well equipped, and never ran out of drinks, and all the men and woman helping out were very friendly and helpful. The only thing I would change is having stronger beers at the end" (https://racetothesun.co.za)

**Anonymous rider [RECREATIONAL]:** "Unbelievably well organised, Incredible scenery and a 'bucket list' event. Compliments to every marshal and water point personal, thumbs up to a great race." (https://racetothesun.co.za)

**Dexter-morgan [UNKNOWN]:** "Entered, I have a score to settle with this race... last time I got sick and was basically pushed home for the last 20km." (https://forum.bikehub.co.za/topic/195470-event-king-price-race-to-the-sun/)

**Anonymous rider [RECREATIONAL]:** "Water Points were great …friendly support, well stocked with a variety of snacks to keep us going ⭐ … route was well marked all the way ⭐… single tracks added to the fun element ⭐… and the red cheerleader ladies ended my race on an even higher note ⭐" (https://racetothesea.co.za)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Tire Choice Discussion:**

**Jbr [UNKNOWN]:** Asked about tire choice and corrugation concerns, stating "Corrugation scares me as my bike is stiff AF, the sand not so much" (https://forum.bikehub.co.za/topic/195470-event-king-price-race-to-the-sun/)

**Dexter-morgan [UNKNOWN]:** Responded about the course: "there is quite a bit of corrugation and loose sand... There are lots of short sections parts with corrugation." (https://forum.bikehub.co.za/topic/195470-event-king-price-race-to-the-sun/)

**milky4130 [UNKNOWN]:** Suggested "50cc tires should take care of both sand & corrugation. Like you said in the other thread about gearing now its tire choice. Horse for Courses." (https://forum.bikehub.co.za/topic/195470-event-king-price-race-to-the-sun/)

**Jbr [UNKNOWN]:** Disputed this: "nah I don't think so. I'm on 45c now and it doesn't make a difference on corrugated roads, at least it didn't make it any less *** than 42s and 40s that I had before. I think only suspension takes care of that, and even with suspensions it's a *** ride. But on the crux oof, it's really rough, guess I'll run pressures as low as I can and hope for the best..." (https://forum.bikehub.co.za/topic/195470-event-king-price-race-to-the-sun/)

**Bike Choice:**

**eala [UNKNOWN]:** "Difficult call to make on bicycle type and tyre choice. You have to choose your pain. Personally i think an XC bike with big gearing is the best and probably as fast as a gravel bike. Old style XC bike 100mm travel with 2 x 11 would be perfect." (https://forum.bikehub.co.za/topic/195470-event-king-price-race-to-the-sun/)

**JJDT [UNKNOWN]:** "Nothing major to have "special" tyres, your normal tyre choice will be just fine with your normal riding pressures." (https://forum.bikehub.co.za/topic/195470-event-king-price-race-to-the-sun/)

## Weather Experienced

**2025 Race Conditions [UNKNOWN LEVEL rider]:** "rain, wind, cold and some sun' - basically everything except extreme heat" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYSA5w9weX0)

General race timing note: May timing in South Africa's autumn should mean decent conditions (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYSA5w9weX0)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Route Structure - Two Distinct Halves:**

From 2025 race report: "This year's route was a story of two distinct halves. The first section followed the picturesque Hartbeestpoort Dam Wall and the canals, offering fast, flowing sections where riders could settle into their rhythm. The second half transformed into a rugged 'bush' experience, with challenging gravel sections, sand and the new Sediba Kwele testing riders' endurance and technical skills. This contrast created a unique race dynamic, forcing teams to adapt their strategies as the terrain shifted dramatically." (https://racetothesun.co.za/honeycomb226ers_dominate/)

**2026 Route Change:**

"4 kilometres of winding tracks through Sediba Kwêle have been replaced by a shorter, but still scenic loop through the reserve, where wildlife sightings are highly likely. This reduces the total distance to 158 kilometres, while the accumulated elevation gain remains under the 1 000 metre psychological barrier." (https://diverge.info/2025/11/25/race-to-the-sun-go-gravel-in-2026-with-sas-og-grave-bike-race/)

**Specific Course Features:**

- "Starting at the stunning Hartbeespoort Dam wall, participants will ride through vibrant sunflower fields, serene canals, and vast gravel roads." (https://forum.bikehub.co.za/topic/197388-event-king-price-race-to-the-sun/)

- "The second half do have more climbs and uphill drags" (https://forum.bikehub.co.za/topic/195470-event-king-price-race-to-the-sun/)

- The first half of the route, along irrigation canals, is described as "open if not readily accessible to the public, while the second half is raced on private roads, which are otherwise closed to cycling" (https://diverge.info/2025/11/25/race-to-the-sun-go-gravel-in-2026-with-sas-og-grave-bike-race/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**First Half Pacing Warning [Multiple UNKNOWN level riders]:**

**Pandatron [UNKNOWN]:** "Dont get carried away on the first half, second half has some sting" (https://forum.bikehub.co.za/topic/195470-event-king-price-race-to-the-sun/)

**JJDT [UNKNOWN]:** "As already mentioned the first half is easy, mostly flat with some downhill and no climbs and with this one tends to going all out. The second half do have more climbs and uphill drags and if you have wasted most of the energy on the first half the second half will be a long ride with no power." (https://forum.bikehub.co.za/topic/195470-event-king-price-race-to-the-sun/)

**Elite Race Tactics:**

**Elite Men's 2025 [Marc Pritzen - ELITE]:** Launched solo breakaway at 70km mark, maintained 7-minute gap to finish. Finished in 4:30:11. Strategy relied on team disruption of chase group. (https://racetothesun.co.za/honeycomb226ers_dominate/)

**Elite Women's 2025 [ELITE]:** Race became tactical three-way battle after 130km mark between Preen, Sanders, and Willeit. Winner Preen finished in 5:23:46 when rivals missed critical turn in closing kilometers. (https://racetothesun.co.za/honeycomb226ers_dominate/)

**Nutrition:**

**JJDT [UNKNOWN]:** "Nutrition; as mentioned to late to change [2 days before race]. Use what you normal ride with." (https://forum.bikehub.co.za/topic/195470-event-king-price-race-to-the-sun/)

**Time Goals [UNKNOWN level - JP Nortje, Race Director]:**

"Really fast riders, in and around the Top 20, can target a Sub-5 finishing time, while a more realistic target for competitive gravel racers is a Sub-6. A good time for the 100-Miler is anything Sub-7, and a Sub-8 will likely secure you a top-half finish." (https://diverge.info/2025/11/25/race-to-the-sun-go-gravel-in-2026-with-sas-og-grave-bike-race/)

**2025 Finishing Time Reference Points:**
- Elite Men winner: 4:30:11
- Elite Women winner: 5:23:46
- Sub Vet Men winner: 4:52:52
- Vet Men winner: 5:01:53
- Senior Men winner: 5:25:39
- Master Men winner: 5:03:22
- Grand Master Men winner: 5:29:57

## DNF Risk Factors

**Course Navigation:**

Elite women's race 2025 saw podium positions change in final kilometers when two riders "missed a critical turn along with Sanders, allowing Preen to claim the win" - suggests navigation requires attention even at elite level in closing stages. (https://racetothesun.co.za/honeycomb226ers_dominate/)

**Health/Bonking:**

**Dexter-morgan [UNKNOWN]:** "last time I got sick and was basically pushed home for the last 20km" - indicates second half can be brutal if energy management fails (https://forum.bikehub.co.za/topic/195470-event-king-price-race-to-the-sun/)

**Elite Women's Race 2025:** "pre-race favourite Sarah Hill (Team Efficient Infiniti) setting a strong early pace before fading after 132km" - even elite favorites can crack in final 30km (https://racetothesun.co.za/honeycomb226ers_dominate/)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Water Point Quality [Multiple RECREATIONAL riders]:**

"The Magalies Citrus water points were exceptional, offering everything from traditional bananas to hot pancakes, juices, chicken and popcorn, keeping riders fueled and motivated throughout the course." (https://racetothesun.co.za/honeycomb226ers_dominate/)

"The feeding and hydration stations were all very well equipped, and never ran out of drinks, and all the men and woman helping out were very friendly and helpful" (https://racetothesun.co.za)

"Magalies Citrus adds exceptional hospitality, of the kind one only finds in rural areas in South Africa, to the race day experience" (https://diverge.info/2025/11/25/race-to-the-sun-go-gravel-in-2026-with-sas-og-grave-bike-race/)

**Community Support:**

Race Director JP Nortje: "one thing we never anticipated was the support we would receive from the communities along the route. The Beestekraal Church congregation and the Magalies Citrus farmers have taken the water points and the vibe along the course to the next level. Their support and enthusiasm makes the event special in a way that isn't quantifiable. Every year we get praise for the standard of the King Price Race to the Sun water points, and every year we have to defer all praise to the volunteers from the congregation and the farming community." (https://diverge.info/2025/11/25/race-to-the-sun-go-gravel-in-2026-with-sas-og-grave-bike-race/)

**Community Giving:**

"A special mention must go to Sanddrift Laerskool, whose assistance with car transfers ensured all vehicles were in Sun City before 1 pm. The most efficient organisation to date. As part of our commitment to giving back, a portion of the proceeds will be donated to the school." (https://racetothesun.co.za/honeycomb226ers_dominate/)

**Post-Race:**

Anonymous rider: "The only thing I would change is having stronger beers at the end" (https://racetothesun.co.za)

"One of the best local races, good vibes at the finish." (https://racetothesun.co.za)

**Bucket List Status:**

Multiple riders described it as a "bucket list" event (https://racetothesun.co.za and https://racetothesea.co.za)

**Event Scale & Prestige:**

"With over 2000 entrants, it's one of the country's largest off-road races and consistently attracts the biggest names in South African MTB/Gravel racing as well as high-profile road cycling professionals." (https://www.treadmtb.co.za/a-prestige-boost-for-king-price-race-to-the-sun/)

"Among the hundreds of cycling events on the calendar, few are as prestigious at the King Price Race to the Sun. There's professional infrastructure at the start and finish with a route that's been checked and double checked for safety. There are high-quality finisher medals, a race pack that contains useful product, live social media coverage of the top contenders, a post-race edited video, professionally shot photos of each entrant, fully stocked refreshment points on the route and at the finish; and a classy prize-giving ceremony to acknowledge the best performers who also get decent cash prizes!"
