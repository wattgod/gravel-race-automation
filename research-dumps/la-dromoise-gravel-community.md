# LA DRÔMOISE GRAVEL — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Race Overview & Course Options

La Drômoise is a multi-day cycling festival held on the 3rd weekend of September in Die, France, featuring 14 different routes over 3 days combining gravel, road cycling, and touring options.

- 75km - 1,800m elevation gain

**2025/2026 course evolution:** "For this 6th edition, La Drômoise gravel evolves and takes you further south. You now ride on the slopes opposite the Glandasse, at the foot of the Châtillonais vineyard" (https://www.cyclodromoise.com/project_category/gravel/)

The gravel routes feature "the atypical atmosphere of 'Diois' gravel: a mixture of small paved roads and stony tracks" (https://www.cyclodromoise.com/project_category/gravel/)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**[UNKNOWN]:** From the 2023 edition description: "At the start, the whistle blows, and the cyclists set off with determination, hoping their tires will hold up on the bumpy paths. First kilometer, some riders are already on their knees removing pebbles from their shoes, wondering if they really signed up for this." (https://www.cyclodromoise.com/photos-la-dromoise-gravel/)

**[UNKNOWN]:** "Halfway through, the competition becomes serious, but the atmosphere remains good-natured, with riders exchanging knowing glances after surviving a perilous descent. The vineyards offer a welcome respite, with their orderly rows offering an illusion of calm before the next chaotic section." (https://www.cyclodromoise.com/photos-la-dromoise-gravel/)

**[UNKNOWN]:** "Final kilometers, the finish line is in sight, and despite the hills, steep descents and vicious pebbles, the cyclists keep smiling, telling themselves they survived the 2023 edition of the Drômoise and have incredible stories to tell." (https://www.cyclodromoise.com/photos-la-dromoise-gravel/)

The course geography includes "the heights of the Vercors plateau" and "the unmissable Diois" with "accents of scrubland" in certain areas (https://www.granfondoguide.com/Events/Index/10265/la-dr%C3%B4moise)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**[UNKNOWN]:** "A 3-day celebration of cycling and culture alongside the sporting event with partnerships with Théâtre Les Aires and the 'L'Echappée des Rues' festival that will delight young and old, before, during and after the sporting events!" (https://www.cyclodromoise.com)

**[UNKNOWN]:** "You were just over 3,600 this year... how many will you be in 2026?" - Thomas BECHET, President of La Drômoise (https://www.cyclodromoise.com)

The event features "copious refreshment stations, lively musicians, local meals" with "volunteer teams" throughout (https://www.cyclodromoise.com)

**Participant feedback [UNKNOWN]:**

"Congratulations to the top organization. I discovered the magnificent landscapes of the Vercors that I didn't really know, although coming from the Ardèche plateau. The sun was there, the wind and cold didn't bother me more than that, because I'm used to it. I will come back next year to discover other landscapes of the Diois, hoping for luminous weather like this cyclo." (https://www.cyclodromoise.com)

**[UNKNOWN]:** "Thanks to all those who worked to organize this beautiful cyclo. A big thank you also to all the volunteers who welcomed and served us with a smile." (https://www.cyclodromoise.com)

**[UNKNOWN]:** "Congratulations for this event that offered very beautiful courses and was full of participants... Always a pleasure to find your organization and a special thank you to the security manager who brought us all his experience." (https://www.cyclodromoise.com)

**[UNKNOWN]:** "3 days on the banks of the Drômoise. A whole weekend of alternating between cycling tours and journeys to the heart of 'l'échappée des rues'. A long quiet river letting ourselves be carried, my wife and I, on the waves of an artistic and sporting river... How sweet it is to let yourself be carried by 'kind people' who offer us. Thank you for these moments of common celebrations between body and mind." (https://www.cyclodromoise.com)
