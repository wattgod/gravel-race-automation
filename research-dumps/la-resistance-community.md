# LA RESISTANCE — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Stu Bowers [ELITE]:** "The scene before the start of La Resistance is unlike any sportive I've ever encountered. For one thing, it's not pre-dawn. The sun is up and breakfast was enjoyed at an almost sociable hour. There are no pens full of riders jostling for position near the front... It's all very relaxed. I could just as easily be on holiday, rather than preparing to embark on an epic day in the Alps." (https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/la-resistance-sportive-vive-la-resistance)

**Stu Bowers [ELITE]:** "The Col des Glières has drained my physical reserves, and looking around at other riders slumped in chairs at the feed station, or draped over benches stretching out hamstrings, I realise I'm not alone in having found it brutal." (https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/la-resistance-sportive-vive-la-resistance)

**Stu Bowers [ELITE]:** "It hasn't escaped my attention that, despite the relaxed atmosphere, there are some extremely trim-looking individuals at the start line, with legs as ripped as pros and tan lines to match. I suspect that once the gun goes, the competitive spirit will kick in... no matter how much you insist it's not a race, it always is."

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Stu Bowers [ELITE]:** "My own chosen steed is the 3T Exploro... rolling on 700c, 40mm WTB Nano gravel tyres, which I hope will provide the perfect middle ground – not too draggy, but durable, grippy and comfortable enough for both man and machine to stay the course." The 40mm choice proved successful: "My 40mm tyres have definitely come into their own. I feel confident riding at the kind of speeds that mean I'm quickly catching and passing those skinny-tyred whippets who had overtaken me on the Arpettaz climb." (https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/la-resistance-sportive-vive-la-resistance)

**Tire range observed [UNKNOWN level riders]:** "Around me I note some riders have simply fitted wider 25mm or 28mm road tyres to their top-end carbon race machines, while others have chosen a far more aggressive gravel set-up. Knobbly tyres on cyclocross bikes seem to be a popular choice." (https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/la-resistance-sportive-vive-la-resistance)

**Puncture epidemic [MULTIPLE levels]:** "As I make my way onto the track, gingerly at first, it's not long before I encounter the first of many who have succumbed to the puncture demons, crouched at the roadside fumbling with inner tubes and pumps. It's reassuring to know that out on the course are several bright yellow Mavic Service Course motos loaded with spare wheels... Already the indications are that they're in for a busy day." (https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/la-resistance-sportive-vive-la-resistance)

**Scotty C [UNKNOWN]:** "Confidence riding off-road tracks is required. 42-45mm tyres with good grip are ideal and some low gears make the climbs more user friendly." (https://www.komoot.com/collection/2300993/tour-de-la-resistance-a-gravel-bikepacking-loop-above-lake-annecy)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Col de l'Arpettaz specifics [ELITE rider report]:** "For the first 5km the road sticks at 5-6%, but by the middle it has ramped to 7-10%, maxing out at 12%. There are hairpins galore, and when I emerge out of the tree line in the upper reaches, I'm treated to a spectacular view of the Aravis Alps... It's a true gem of a climb, offering similar stats to Alpe d'Huez but with almost twice as many bends and not a single car to be seen." (https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/la-resistance-sportive-vive-la-resistance)

**Route de la Soif gravel section [ELITE rider report]:** "The 14.3km track is rarely flat and it can be difficult to control speed on the descents while trying to pick the best line through clusters of rocks. When the gradient points up, the challenge switches to maintaining rear-wheel traction on the loose surface. It demands concentration at all times and by the end of its 14.3km my arms and hands have taken as much punishment as my legs." (https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/la-resistance-sportive-vive-la-resistance)

**Route de la Soif surface conditions [ELITE]:** "This sector... the quiet of the bunch is traded for alarmed cries as riders fight to hold a straight line in the loose, dusty gravel." (https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/la-resistance-sportive-vive-la-resistance)

**Col des Glières character [ELITE]:** "The path carved into the cliff face is relentlessly steep – 9% average with large chunks over 10%. At every hairpin I feel certain the gradient must ease, but it never does." (https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/la-resistance-sportive-vive-la-resistance)

**Descent conditions [ELITE]:** "After an arduous couple of hours, I'm now treated to a long descent to La Clusaz and Saint-Jean-de-Sixt. Kilometre after kilometre ticks past at speed, and I relish the wide, sweeping curves." (https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/la-resistance-sportive-vive-la-resistance)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Pacing discipline on Col de l'Arpettaz [ELITE]:** "This is where the wiry riders on their pure road bikes come into their own. They come streaming past me and I have to be strict with myself not to waste energy trying to keep up with them." (https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/la-resistance-sportive-vive-la-resistance)

**Nutrition timing [ELITE]:** "My bottles are supped dry and my legs are close to cramp" at the top of Col des Glières, indicating that feed stations become critical after major climbs. The rider also noted eating fruit cake at the Col de l'Arpettaz feed station and chomping "on an energy bar" after getting lost on a descent. (https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/la-resistance-sportive-vive-la-resistance)

**Route navigation caution [ELITE experience]:** "In the excitement of the descent I somehow miss a route arrow and find myself off course and needing to backtrack up part of the climb. I'm annoyed at my error but equally concerned that this misspent energy will haunt me later." (https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/la-resistance-sportive-vive-la-resistance)

**Three-day tour pacing advice [UNKNOWN]:** "Fuel well before starting this Tour as there's a hefty amount of climbing on day one for its distance... Day two is more relaxed, with less climbing (although it is steep at times) and distance to cover... Day three... you'll be glad to know though that there's more down than up for this return to Talloires!"

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Event philosophy [Organizers Adam Horler and Ross Muir]:** "Their plan was never to simply create another Alpine sportive. La Resistance was conceived to have a deeper purpose than simply to sort out the fastest riders over a punishing course. As its name suggests, the aim is to commemorate the men and women of the French Resistance who fought valiantly for this Haute Savoie region to hold back Nazi advances during the Second World War." (https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/la-resistance-sportive-vive-la-resistance)

**Start line vibe:** "There are no pens full of riders jostling for position near the front. In fact, as I look around barely anyone has even bothered to gather on the start line yet. Instead most are content to sit on the scattered hay bails or kick back on the grass, sipping a last-minute coffee and chatting. Just a few metres away the calm waters of Lake Annecy lap against a sandy shore." (https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/la-resistance-sportive-vive-la-resistance)

**Post-race party:** "Horler and Muir hope riders will focus on more that just average speeds. They want people to reflect on the past, as well as take time to enjoy the beautiful landscape of the region, which explains the lethargic start to proceedings. 'And besides, you wouldn't want to finish so tired you can't enjoy the traditional La Guinguette after-party,' says Muir." (https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/la-resistance-sportive-vive-la-resistance)

**"Not a race" spirit:** "La Resistance is not a race. It's not about the fastest time or the first across the line. It is a chance to challenge yourself, marvel at the beauty of nature and reflect on the sacrifices of others." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/la-resistance)

**Entry limit significance:** "Entry is €95 and limited to 463 riders – the same number of Resistance fighters who sought refuge on the Plateau in 1944." (https://www.freewheelingfrance.com/blog/la-resistance.html)
