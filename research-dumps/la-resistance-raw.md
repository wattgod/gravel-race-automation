## OFFICIAL DATA
No information available on 2025 or 2026 race dates, registration costs, entry fees, field size, prize purse, start time, aid stations, or cutoff times from search results[1][5].

**Distance options and elevation gain**: 
- **La Resistance** (full route): Not explicitly quantified in miles (user-known 65 miles/5500 ft not confirmed); includes HC climb of **Col de l’Arpettaz**, “HC Gravel” **Route de la Soif**, and ferocious **6.8km Cat 2 climb** to Plateau des Glieres at average gradient over **10%**[1][5].
- **La Petite** (shorter route): Taste of the full event; shares **Col de l’Arpettaz** and **Route de la Soif**, then ascends **Cat 3 Col de la Croix Fry** instead of full Glieres climb[1].

Start location: Beach in **Talloires**, finish at **La Guinguette** in Talloires on Lake Annecy[1][2].

## TERRAIN & COURSE
No specific surface breakdown (% gravel, pavement, singletrack, dirt) available.

**Key course features and named climbs/sectors**:
- **Col de l’Arpettaz** (HC climb, shared by both routes).
- **Route de la Soif** (“HC Gravel” sector with Mont Blanc panorama).
- **Col de la Croix Fry** (Cat 3, La Petite only).
- **Plateau des Glieres** via 6.8km Cat 2 climb (>10% gradient, La Resistance only); ends at National Monument to La Resistance, museum, and necropolis[1][2][5].

**Technical difficulty level**: High altitude gravel roads and demanding road climbs; routes converge before museum with 10km left[1]. Related multi-day bikepacking version notes mix of road, smooth gravel, rough/loose mountain gravel, steep sections up/down; requires off-road confidence, 42-45mm tyres, low gears; some hike-a-bike[2].

**Elevation profile description**: Challenging with high-altitude gravel and road climbs; spectacular Alps terrain around Aravis mountains, Haute Savoie[1][4]. Multi-day extension: 283km, **10,290m** elevation (but single-day event is shorter)[2].

## CLIMATE & CONDITIONS
No typical weather, historical incidents (mud, heat, wind), or specific altitude details (starting/max elevation) available for race dates/location.

Location in **Haute Savoie French Alps** implies high-altitude conditions[1].

## LOGISTICS
