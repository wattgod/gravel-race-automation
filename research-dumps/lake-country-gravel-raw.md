I cannot provide the comprehensive research dump you've requested because **the search results provided do not contain any information about a "Lake Country Gravel" cycling race**.

The search results instead contain detailed information about:
- **Lake Country Triathlon** (swimming, biking, running) on July 25, 2026[1][2][3]
- **Lake Country Challenge** (running events) on August 29, 2026[5][6]
- A school calendar for Lake Country Classical Academy[4]

## What I Found vs. What You're Looking For

None of the search results mention:
- A gravel cycling race called "Lake Country Gravel"
- A 70-mile gravel event
- Any gravel-specific race in Oconomowoc, Wisconsin
- Elevation gain data for a cycling gravel race
- Gravel race dates, registration fees, or field sizes

## Next Steps

To properly research the Lake Country Gravel race, I would need search results that specifically target:
- The official Lake Country Gravel race website
- Gravel cycling race databases (like Gravel.run or similar platforms)
- Cycling forums or Reddit discussions mentioning this specific event
- Race reports from participants

**If this race exists**, it's possible it:
- Has a different official name
- Is organized separately from the triathlon/running events in the search results
- May not have extensive online documentation
- Could be a newer or smaller event with limited web presence

Would you like me to search specifically for "Lake Country Gravel race" or provide information based on new search results?
