# LAUF GRITFEST — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Emily Tillett [ELITE]:** "Day 1 covered 73km with 1,700m of elevation and three timed segments — 9.4km, 19km, and 6.7km. It brought both mechanical issues and a stage win — a pretty good summary of gravel: highs and lows in a single ride." (https://road.cc/content/feature/why-i-gravel-weekend-lauf-gritfest-velocio-314643)

**Emily Tillett [ELITE]:** "There's a noticeably different ethos in gravel racing compared to road racing. It's much more relaxed – wear what works, ride at the pace that suits you, and enjoy the experience... Most of the route is untimed, since racing on UK bridleways isn't allowed. That turns the transfers between stages into rolling social rides – no scrambling for position or elbows-out chaos first thing in the morning." (https://road.cc/content/feature/why-i-gravel-weekend-lauf-gritfest-velocio-314643)

**Emily Tillett [ELITE]:** "One of gravel's biggest draws is how little time you spend thinking about cars. Aside from the occasional farmer or forestry vehicle, it's virtually traffic-free... Most gravel rides are non-stop too. Without junctions, traffic lights or roundabouts, you keep moving and the only pauses are for gates, photos, or the all-important café stop." (https://road.cc/content/feature/why-i-gravel-weekend-lauf-gritfest-velocio-314643)

**Emily Tillett [ELITE]:** "Crashing on gravel still hurts, but it often feels more within your control. You're choosing your lines, setting your own pace, and riding solo or in small groups. At events like Gritfest, timed segments are solo efforts – you're racing the clock, not a peloton." (https://road.cc/content/feature/why-i-gravel-weekend-lauf-gritfest-velocio-314643)

**Rachel Sokal [COMPETITIVE]:** "The 6 km of gradual uphill was a torturous lesson to me that I not only should have gone for a smaller chain ring, I probably should have done a bit less chatting and a bit more breathing on the transition climb too." (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report–gritfest-2022)

**Rachel Sokal [COMPETITIVE]:** "The second stage was an epic - nearly 20 km of undulating trails on ever changing grades of gravel. The riders at the side of the trail fixing punctures were a sharp reminder to balance all-out speed with keeping bike and self in one piece." (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report–gritfest-2022)

**Rachel Sokal [COMPETITIVE]:** "Day two was a much drier and shorter affair although the fact that the 60 km route included 1,500 m of climbing meant I continued to curse my relaxed attitude to selecting gearing. At least the day's stages were predominately downhill and so riders could pace their tired legs up the hills." (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report–gritfest-2022)

**Rachel Sokal [COMPETITIVE]:** "The most fun was saved for the last stage with a spectacular fast descent on a winding track through an old lead mine. The only downside is that there was no chance to stop and take it all in." (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report–gritfest-2022)

**Rachel Sokal [COMPETITIVE]:** "Gritfest is a superb event both on and off the bike. The course is brilliantly put together balancing the fun and the challenge. There's a load of other stuff to occupy and entertain you too whether it be the beauty of the scenery, the spot prizes from the sponsors, the gravy on the chips or the dodgy dancing. I'll be back next year, albeit with far more sensible gearing." (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report–gritfest-2022)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Emily Tillett [ELITE]:** Rode a Specialized Diverge (2018 model) with Future Shock suspension (20mm), Scribe Race Disc wheels (aluminium), WTB Resolute 42mm tyres, and SRAM mechanical components (Red chainset, Force 1 shifters and callipers, Rival rear mech). (https://road.cc/content/feature/why-i-gravel-weekend-lauf-gritfest-velocio-314643)

**Rachel Sokal [COMPETITIVE]:** Emphasized gearing issues multiple times. Key lesson: **Bring smaller gearing than you'd use for flat riding.** The Welsh climbs are steep (mentions "20% gradient climb") and sustained. She specifically regretted not changing her "usual flat-riding gearing" before the event. (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report–gritfest-2022)

**General observation [COMPETITIVE source]:** Punctures were common enough on the fast gravel sections to warrant cautious speed management. Multiple riders seen fixing flats during Stage 2. (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report–gritfest-2022)

## Weather Experienced

**2022 Edition:** Saturday started dry but "the heavens opened ahead of the race." Riders needed waterproofs for Day 1. Heavy rain continued through the day ("wet dust splatter" on glasses). The rain intensified at event central after riding finished, forcing people into tents. Day 2 was "a much drier" affair. (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report–gritfest-2022)

**2025 Edition:** Weather looked "unpredictable both mornings" according to pre-ride forecasts. Emily started each day with an extra layer (either Velocio Ultralight Vest or Ultrapack Jacket). (https://road.cc/content/feature/why-i-gravel-weekend-lauf-gritfest-velocio-314643)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Stage 1:** 9.4km with gradual uphill on gravel tracks. Course begins with "a steep gravel track" climb to the start line. (https://road.cc/content/feature/why-i-gravel-weekend-lauf-gritfest-velocio-314643 and https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report–gritfest-2022)

**Stage 2 (Day 1):** 19km, described as "an epic" with "undulating trails on ever changing grades of gravel." This is the longest timed stage of the event. (https://road.cc/content/feature/why-i-gravel-weekend-lauf-gritfest-velocio-314643 and https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report–gritfest-2022)

**Stage 3 (Day 1):** 6.7km with "punchy climbs and drifting descents." Includes 8km total. (https://road.cc/content/feature/why-i-gravel-weekend-lauf-gritfest-velocio-314643 and https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report–gritfest-2022)

**Final Stage (Day 2):** "Spectacular fast descent on a winding track through an old lead mine" - described as the most fun stage but over too quickly to appreciate fully. (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report–gritfest-2022)

**Route around Llyn Brianne reservoir:** Riders get "epic scenery" views. The finale includes riding "on the iconic dam wall of Llyn Brianne." (https://road.cc/content/feature/why-i-gravel-weekend-lauf-gritfest-velocio-314643 and https://gritfest.co.uk/)

**Transition climbs:** Between timed stages, riders face significant untimed climbing, including one section described as "winching up a 20% gradient climb." (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report–gritfest-2022)

**Cambrian Mountains character:** Described as "quiet valleys, remote tracks" with "rolling trails, rolling hills." The terrain is 70% off-road with only 40% on timed stages. (https://road.cc/content/feature/why-i-gravel-weekend-lauf-gritfest-velocio-314643 and https://gritfest.co.uk/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Rachel Sokal [COMPETITIVE]:** Learned that pacing the transition climbs matters: "perhaps I should have done a bit less chatting and a bit more breathing on the transition climb" before Stage 1. The untimed sections aren't recovery - they're preparation for timed efforts. (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report–gritfest-2022)

**Rachel Sokal [COMPETITIVE]:** On Day 2, "riders could pace their tired legs up the hills" because the stages were "predominately downhill." Strategy shifted to conserving energy on climbs to save power for descent stages. (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report–gritfest-2022)

**Rachel Sokal [COMPETITIVE]:** Speed management is crucial: "balance all-out speed with keeping bike and self in one piece" after seeing multiple punctures on fast sections. (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report–gritfest-2022)

**Emily Tillett [ELITE]:** "The nature of gravel means you're never really out of it. You can go stage-by-stage, target a segment, or just enjoy pushing yourself" even after mechanicals derailed overall placing. Rally format allows tactical reset between stages. (https://road.cc/content/feature/why-i-gravel-weekend-lauf-gritfest-velocio-314643)

**General format note:** Most of the route is untimed due to UK bridleway restrictions, creating natural recovery/social sections between timed efforts. This is fundamentally different from continuous racing. (https://road.cc/content/feature/why-i-gravel-weekend-lauf-gritfest-velocio-314643)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Mechanicals:** Emily Tillett [ELITE] experienced "mechanical issues" on Day 1 that "put the overall out of reach." Multiple riders were seen "fixing punctures" during Stage 2. (https://road.cc/content/feature/why-i-gravel-weekend-lauf-gritfest-velocio-314643 and https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report–gritfest-2022)

**Gearing inadequacy:** Rachel Sokal [COMPETITIVE] repeatedly mentions struggling with gearing on Welsh climbs, specifically noting she should have changed from "flat-riding gearing" to smaller ratios. Inadequate gearing could lead to blown legs or inability to complete climbs. (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report–gritfest-2022)

**Weather management:** 2022 edition showed weather can deteriorate rapidly - "dry skies early on Saturday lulled the riders into a false sense of security before the heavens opened." Inadequate rain gear could lead to hypothermia risk. (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report–gritfest-2022)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Emily Tillett [ELITE]:** "With no phone signal at the campsite, the social side carries on into the evening, with people sitting around and sharing stories from the day. It feels more like a weekend away than a race weekend." (https://road.cc/content/feature/why-i-gravel-weekend-lauf-gritfest-velocio-314643)

**Rachel Sokal [COMPETITIVE]:** "Despite the weather there was a cheery atmosphere and plenty of excited chat between riders as we rolled out along the idyllic Welsh country lanes." Even in rain, the mood stayed positive. (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report–gritfest-2022)

**Rachel Sokal [COMPETITIVE]:** Post-ride atmosphere: "riders made good use of the bike and person washing facilities and array of food and drink outlets to recover from the day's riding. Then the rain really came down, so we hid in our tents until the evening brought out the sunshine, entertainment and some very dodgy dancing in front of a very lively local band." (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report–gritfest-2022)

**Event amenities:** Multiple catering outlets including pizza and Stokh brewery on site. Live music and entertainment until 10pm Friday and Saturday nights. Quiet camping area available away from main entertainment. Families and dogs welcome. Bike wash facilities, showers, spot prizes from sponsors. (https://road.cc/content/feature/why-i-gravel-weekend-lauf-gritfest-velocio-314643 and https://www.eventrac.co.uk/e/lauf-gritfest-8732)

**Rally format creates social riding:** "The transfers between stages into rolling social rides – no scrambling for position or elbows-out chaos first thing in the morning." Very different from aggressive road racing starts. (https://road.cc/content/feature/why-i-gravel-weekend-lauf-gritfest-velocio-314643)

**Event size:** Limited to 400 participants. (https://www.granfondo.com/events/lauf-gritfest-2025/2025-06-20/6908/cycling)

**Organized by:** A Cycling, run by top Welsh rider Matt Page and his wife Nia, known for "several popular and challenging events." (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report–gritfest-2022)
