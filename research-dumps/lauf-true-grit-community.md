# LAUF TRUE GRIT GRAVEL EPIC — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Carey Lowery [ELITE]:** "45 miles, 5500 feet gain. Race morning was 38 degrees. Forgetting that a Utah 38 is different than a Tennessee 38, I put on arm/leg warmers... I was in the Open Women's field, set to go off first at 8:20." (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2019/03/true-grit-epic-race-report.html)

**Carey Lowery [ELITE]:** "I had my own personal goals: have FUN, don't CRASH, MOTIVATE others, and CLEAN the Waterfall. I also gave myself a time goal: 4:15." Finished in 4:31:46. (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2019/03/true-grit-epic-race-report.html)

**Carey Lowery [ELITE]:** "As Scott Harper would say, 'The pucker factor so high, I almost bit a chunk out of my chamois!' I had studied Thom Parson's video the night before, playing it 7 or so times, trying to visualize the line. Enter to the left, sweep to the right, over the boulder, roll the drop, back to the left, ker-chunk, ker-chunk, ker-chunk, roll over the drop to the right, fight the urge to go back to the left, hit the last boulder drop, and shoot out the right. Boom! I did it!" (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2019/03/true-grit-epic-race-report.html)

**Carey Lowery [ELITE]:** "Zen is my absolute favorite. Super techy, with punchy ledgey climbs, I was pretty much red-lining it the whole time. One line I took during the race that I was afraid to during the pre-ride was a short but scary cliffside climb. I think I kept my right eye closed as I rode this section." (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2019/03/true-grit-epic-race-report.html)

**Carey Lowery [ELITE]:** "The slickrock is amazingly grippy. To be able to climb super steep pitches without any rear wheel spin is so much fun." (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2019/03/true-grit-epic-race-report.html)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**[ELITE] Carey's Setup:** Overdressed initially with arm and leg warmers for 38°F start. Stripped arm warmers down to wrists early in race, kept leg warmers on "as slight protection against a potential crash on the rocks of Zen." Multiple riders flatted early on the descent to Zen loop - chose to ride cautiously after seeing "5 riders off the trail with flats so early in the race." (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2019/03/true-grit-epic-race-report.html)

**[COMPETITIVE] Tom Marvin on Lauf True Grit bike tire pressure:** Initially ran tires at ~50psi but experimented with sub-40psi. Found that "on-tarmac handling is compromised" at very low pressures with the Lauf fork - "the feel between tarmac and bar is just too vague." Settled on rear around 40psi, front back up to 48psi. Used Maxxis Rambler (front) and Bontrager GR2 (rear) tires. (https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/gravel-bikes/lauf-true-grit-race-axs-long-term-review)

**[COMPETITIVE] Lauf True Grit Race AXS bike features:** "Grit SL fork that steals the show. This leaf-sprung suspension fork offers 30mm of travel, which is enough to take the sting out of the dirt roads... incredibly good at reducing handlebar buzz." Bike includes "DT Swiss alloy hoops wrapped in Maxxis Rambler tyres, a SRAM Force/XX1 AXS wireless 1x groupset with a 10-50t cassette."

## Weather Experienced

**2019 Race (Carey Lowery):** "Race morning was 38 degrees" in Santa Clara, Utah. She noted "Forgetting that a Utah 38 is different than a Tennessee 38" - implying drier conditions. "The typical headwind was not there today" on Stucki Springs section. (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2019/03/true-grit-epic-race-report.html)

**Winter riding conditions (Tom Marvin, Scotland - not race location):** Rode in near-freezing conditions with frost and ice patches, noting "under 40psi in my Maxxis Rambler (f) and Bontrager GR2 (r) tyres, I still skirted around the most glass-like patches of ice without issue."

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**The Waterfall [ELITE perspective]:** "There is a 'danger danger' sign warning you just before the approach. Once you pass the sign, you are committed to riding it." Technical line: "Enter to the left, sweep to the right, over the boulder, roll the drop, back to the left, ker-chunk, ker-chunk, ker-chunk, roll over the drop to the right, fight the urge to go back to the left, hit the last boulder drop, and shoot out the right." (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2019/03/true-grit-epic-race-report.html)

**Course sections [ELITE perspective]:**
- **Cove Wash:** "First few miles were fast and a bit muddy"
- **Green Valley:** "Serpentine 8 mile section in which I would ride up a rocky wash to the top of the hill and then rip it down double track to the valley floor and hit another climb through another wash. This seemed to go on forever and you had to make sure you followed the orange tape and signage because it was easy to blow through a turn on the descents."
- **Zen loop:** "Super techy, with punchy ledgey climbs... Even the descents worked me over with lots of chunky drops."
- **Bear Claw Poppy:** "4 mile descending pump track for XC bikes. There were alternate lines where you could get some serious air or just stay on the ground and carve the ribbons of dirt."
- **Stucki Springs:** "800 feet climb in 4 miles... This trail is straight and I could see it all the way to the horizon."
- **Barrel Roll:** "About the same mileage as Zen, but less technical and with half the amount of climbing... saddle section... knuckle breaker climb"

**Slickrock characteristics [ELITE]:** "The slickrock is amazingly grippy. To be able to climb super steep pitches without any rear wheel spin is so much fun." (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2019/03/true-grit-epic-race-report.html)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**[ELITE] Carey Lowery's approach:** "The race started out with a neutral 1 mile roll out through the town of Santa Clara. Once we turned left and hit the double track, everyone dropped the hammer! The first couple climbs were a punch to the gut for me and soon I was dangling off the back. I was cool about it and waited for the legs to come to life." (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2019/03/true-grit-epic-race-report.html)

**[ELITE] Aid station strategy:** Lost time at first aid station "fumbling with arm warmer and glove liner removal." Used drop bag at Barrel Roll aid station (mile 35), "swapped bottles, and took a caffeinated Gu shot." Passed one aid station without stopping despite being out of water because she "didn't want the gap between Carri and I to grow any bigger. I figured I was only about 15-20 minutes from the Barrel Roll aid station." (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2019/03/true-grit-epic-race-report.html)

**[ELITE] Mental approach on climbs:** "Beginning the climb up Zen, I made mental notes of where I needed to try to conserve, where I needed to dig deep (which was most of it), and where I needed to just get off and run it up." (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2019/03/true-grit-epic-race-report.html)

**[ELITE] Final push:** "Knowing that I only had about 6 miles of tough trail left (the last 3 miles of the race being mostly downhill and with 1 mile of pavement), I attempted to make one last hard push... The last 3 miles I began to feel real good as the caffeine kicked in and I started picking off racers one by one." (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2019/03/true-grit-epic-race-report.html)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Flats:** Multiple riders flatted early in the race. Carey noted seeing "5 riders off the trail with flats so early in the race" on the descent to Zen loop, causing her to "err on the side of caution" and ride more conservatively. (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2019/03/true-grit-epic-race-report.html)

**Navigation:** "You had to make sure you followed the orange tape and signage because it was easy to blow through a turn on the descents" in the Green Valley section. (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2019/03/true-grit-epic-race-report.html)

**Technical crashes:** Carey had near-miss: "There were some whoop-de-doos on the initial descent [from Amen Hill], one of which I unintentionally did a tail-whip and landed (tire side down) into some bushes (fortunately not cacti). How I landed that one safely I do not know." (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2019/03/true-grit-epic-race-report.html)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Pre-race atmosphere:** "I approached the start line and heard a Scottish accent call out my name. Coach Lynda! I hadn't seen her in years. We talked a bit, helping me to forget about all the heavy hitters in the field and how I was about to be 'schooled.'" (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2019/03/true-grit-epic-race-report.html)

**Trail etiquette issues:** "Soon was being passed by the later waves, which included the age group Men categories. Most played nicely, but some obviously had no clue about the 'trail' of their rear wheel. More than once I had to brake, which made me 'Yosemite Sam' it under my breath." (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2019/03/true-grit-epic-race-report.html)

**Trail angels:** "I was out of water, and there was a trail angel at the top [of Amen Hill] with a water jug." (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2019/03/true-grit-epic-race-report.html)

**Team experience:** "Spending a week with my teammates on this Rescue Racing Stokecation was a pure joy. I LOVE you guys: Twan, Smooshie, Durango Kid, DJ, and Scott '1000 TSS' Morman. I finally got my RR name by way of Smooshie: 3G!" (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2019/03/true-grit-epic-race-report.html)

**Overall sentiment:** "I absolutely loved this course. My meat and potatoes!... I wish I had more time to spend and session some of the sections that I was just too gassed to attempt... UTAH ... I'll be back. 357'ish days and counting ..." (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2019/03/true-grit-epic-race-report.html)
