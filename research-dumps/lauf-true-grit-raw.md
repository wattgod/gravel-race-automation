- Chacon helped design and authorize many segments of the course herself
- Planning for True Grit races began around 2008-2009

### Lauf Partnership & Naming
- **Critical Partnership**: "This event would not have happened without the partnership of Lauf" - Cimarron Chacon
- **Course Design**: Course was designed on a Lauf True Grit bike, taking advantage of Lauf fork and gravel geometry
- **Bike Recommendation**: Lauf Siegla now recommended - "Born out of Icelandic Lava, equipped with wider tires and a little squish for desert terrain"

### Lauf Cycles Company History (for context)
- **Founded**: 2011 in Iceland by Benedikt Skulason

## 3. TERRAIN & COURSE

### Geographic Setting
- **Convergence Zone**: Mojave Desert, Great Basin, and Colorado Plateau meet here
- **Landscape Features**: Sandstone formations, rock outcroppings, uplifted terrains, ancient volcanic remnants
- **Visual Character**: Red mountains, white cliffs, desert plateaus, otherworldly vegetation

### Surface Types
- Sandy washes
- Sandstone and slickrock
- Rock outcroppings and large boulders
- Fast and flowy singletrack
- Gravel roads (some in rough condition with ruts and washboard)
- Steep climbs to 4 different ridges

### Technical Features
- **Rollers of Doom**: Signature gravel course feature
- **Bear Claw Poppy**: Singletrack section early in race with fun rollers
- **Waterfall Descent**: Infamous technical descent (primarily MTB course)
- **Zen Trail**: Very technical, should be pre-ridden
- **Barrel Ride/Barrel Roll**: Technical section requiring practice
- Several steep drops, climbs, and turns requiring dismounting

### Course Character
- Course becomes increasingly chunky with uphill rock faces requiring hard power surges
- 80% off-road, 20% paved/road
- Starts at Santa Clara Town Hall with 7-mile escorted neutral start through St. George
- "One of the toughest, most technically demanding courses you have ever raced - and the most beautiful"
- Race director notes: designed for riders comfortable with technical terrain

### Difficulty Assessment
- "88.6 miles but rides like a hundred miler"
- 5 miles at True Grit = 10 miles at easier venues (McDowell comparison)
- True Grit 50 feels like 100 miles elsewhere
- Training recommendation: prepare for 125% of race distance
- Technical sections can cause significant time loss if unpracticed

## 5. FORUM INSIGHTS

### TrainerRoad Forum

**Technical Preparation:**
- "45+ miles of very rocky technical trails" - rider using Edge 820/Stages power
- Suggested data fields: elapsed time for nutrition reminders (won't be looking at device often during technical sections)

**Lauf True Grit Bike Discussions:**
- True Grit Ultimate with Red/XX1, power meter, DT Swiss GRC 1400 wheels for $6,590 described as "screaming deal"
- User running 45mm Cinturato gravel M tires with good clearance after 2.5 years ownership
- Added Redshift Sports seatpost for comfort
- Question raised: "Does it ride well on the road?" - relevant for mixed-surface events

### MTBR Forum (Mountain Bike Review)

**Course Difficulty:**
- "There were lines that some practiced literally a dozen times the day before the race and come race day they still froze and had to walk"
- "You can save loads of time knowing the lines through the rocks"
- Training for 125% of distance recommended for technical sections
- "Making advanced technical moves while in a 100 mile race, at hard pace, stressed and likely quite fatigued"

**Equipment Recommendations:**
- Dropper post highly recommended for steep rocky descents
- One rider ran 32/19 ratio on Pivot Les with 100mm fork - "course is pretty rough, tons of rocks and no shade"
- Second half of course described as "pretty fast"

### Race Reports (Various Sources)

**CX Magazine 2019 Coverage:**
- Inaugural gravel event: 94 starters
- Course featured singletrack early (Bear Claw Poppy - fun rollers, fairly smooth)
- Organizers wanted truly off-road gravel course, not road course with dirt connections
- Aid station featured pickles alongside typical race nutrition

**Endurance Path Race Report:**
- Rider with midwest roots/technical inexperience found sections "crazy fun"
- Creek bed sections followed by "most fast and flowy trail ever ridden"
- Freeride zone descent notable experience

**Singletracks Report:**
- Title: "Have I Forgotten How to Suffer?"
- Reflects the race's reputation for being brutally demanding

### General Community Sentiment
- Highly respected as genuine gravel test (not road race on dirt)
- Technical nature polarizing - some love it, others find it too demanding
- Course beauty universally praised
- Early season timing (March) makes it attractive season opener
- Smaller field size (250) creates more intimate experience than mega-events

## 6. BLACK PILL (Honest Truths)

### Course Difficulty Reality Check
- **Not for Beginners**: "There are definitely new racers on the gravel that do not like the highly technical aspect" - Race Director
- **Mandatory Dismounts**: Some sections require walking even for experienced riders
- **Pre-Ride Essential**: Course should be pre-ridden, especially Zen and Barrel Ride sections
- **Practice Doesn't Guarantee Success**: Riders who practiced lines dozens of times still froze on race day

### Weather Unpredictability
- **Last-Minute Course Changes**: Rain the night before has forced major route modifications
- **Start Chaos**: One year, missed trail turn-off caused "herd of buffalo diving off a cliff" scenario as riders scrambled down muddy bank
- **Road Conditions**: Heavy winter precipitation leaves gravel roads with ruts and washboard

### Logistical Considerations
- **Small Field**: 250 cap means could sell out; register early
- **Remote Location**: St. George is small city with limited services
- **Early Start**: Race starts at 7:30 AM; cold morning temps require layering strategy
- **Strict Cutoffs**: DNF if you miss checkpoint times (absolute times, no exceptions)

### Physical Demands
- **Perceived Distance**: 84 miles feels like 100+ miles
- **No Shade**: "Tons of rocks and no shade" - full sun exposure
- **Technical Fatigue**: Must execute technical skills while exhausted
- **Elevation Deception**: Never above 5,000 ft but 9,000 ft of climbing is relentless

### Lauf Connection Reality
- While named after Lauf True Grit bike, **you don't need a Lauf** to race
- Course designed with Lauf suspension fork in mind - rigid forks may suffer
- Some suspension or compliance highly recommended for rocky terrain

### Value Proposition Questions
- Smaller event = less expo/spectacle compared to major gravel races
- March timing conflicts with other spring events
- Technical nature may not suit pure gravel grinders preferring fire roads
- Utah location requires travel for most riders

## 8. SUGGESTED GRAVEL GOD RATINGS

### Rating Scale: 1 (Low) to 5 (High)

|----------|--------|-----------|
| **Scenery** | 5/5 | Stunning convergence of Mojave Desert, Great Basin, Colorado Plateau; red rock, white cliffs, otherworldly vegetation |
| **Technical Challenge** | 5/5 | Among most technical gravel races; mandatory dismounts, rock gardens, steep drops; "rides like 100 miler" |
| **Gravel Authenticity** | 5/5 | 80% off-road, genuine gravel/singletrack mix; not a road race on dirt |
| **Organization** | 4/5 | Well-run local promoter with 15+ years experience; some weather-related course changes in past |
| **Field Quality** | 4/5 | NUE Series opener attracts strong competition; 250 cap creates intimate racing |
