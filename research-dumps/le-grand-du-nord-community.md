# LE GRAND DU NORD — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Jamison [COMPETITIVE]:** "There was something about Le Grand du Nord that really struck me. The location, the people, the challenge. It all built upon things that have deep meaning for me, and it filled me up with joy." (https://secondrunnings.me/2025/05/30/race-report-le-grand-du-nord-50-mile/)

**Jamison [COMPETITIVE]:** "Saturday morning was nice and crisp with predicted high temps just above 50F°. There was some intermittent sun that made it occasionally feel warmer, but we dressed appropriately to ensure we'd be comfortable for the entire time. The fact that the temperature didn't change much throughout the day was a huge bonus as it meant a lot less time of shifting clothing around to meet conditions." (https://secondrunnings.me/2025/05/30/race-report-le-grand-du-nord-50-mile/)

**Mike Ward [COMPETITIVE]:** "What a race! I have rarely felt so underprepared in all ways, but the outcome was the opposite of my expectations. When the go-ahead was announced for the 'casual roll' to begin, I expected my chain to fall off my bike. Instead, I cranked up the hill and away, not to be seen again for five and a half hours with no harm done, better than ever." (https://www.mikeward.cool/blog/racing/le-grand-du-nord-race-report/)

**Mike Ward [COMPETITIVE]:** "I had confidence with a 17 tooth cog in the back for my 40 up front. After setting that back up, there was a lot of slack in the chain and it didn't seem super tight or right... I figured that I'd rather roll a hard gear ratio than a little bit lighter one... because the course was purportedly flatter and easier." (https://www.mikeward.cool/blog/racing/le-grand-du-nord-race-report/)

**Mike Ward [COMPETITIVE]:** "Within 100 yards, we hit a stoplight and waited for several cars to pass through. We all laughed, as it felt very anticlimactic." (https://www.mikeward.cool/blog/racing/le-grand-du-nord-race-report/)

**Mathew Wollmann [ELITE]:** "The rain had not let up. In fact, I think it had gotten worse. As we made our way up the steepish ascent through town and to the first gravel stretch, I knew it was going to be a wet day." (https://www.mathewwollmann.com/post/le-grand-du-nord-2022-110-mile-race-review)

**Mathew Wollmann [ELITE]:** "I found myself in the 400 - 500 watt range rather quickly and warmed up. I was holding strong with the front group, and when we hit the flats it was game on. Follow the leader, hang on, passing on the left type of racing." (https://www.mathewwollmann.com/post/le-grand-du-nord-2022-110-mile-race-review)

**Mathew Wollmann [ELITE]:** "20 miles in there was no way I was seeing out of my sunglasses, and all I could do was hold the wheel in front. Once it finally mellowed down a bit, and around 12 remained in the front group, I slipped the glasses down to take a look around. I couldn't read my Garmin due to the mud and was just hoping those in front knew where we were going." (https://www.mathewwollmann.com/post/le-grand-du-nord-2022-110-mile-race-review)

**Elena Willmot [RECREATIONAL]:** "Within 100 yards, we hit a stoplight and waited for several cars to pass through. We all laughed, as it felt very anticlimactic." (https://www.thenxrth.com/post/mistakes-on-le-grand-du-nord-gravel-race)

**Elena Willmot [RECREATIONAL]:** "At mile four, I turned a corner only to find myself gazing up a steep hill with at least 30 people scattered about, struggling to push their bikes up the hill. I knew this hill was coming, but it looked significantly more intimidating in person than it had on Google Maps. I pedaled as far as I could (likely a handful of yards) before I, too, had to push my bike up the hill, my heart nearly exploding my chest - I was sure it was the end of me." (https://www.thenxrth.com/post/mistakes-on-le-grand-du-nord-gravel-race)

**Elena Willmot [RECREATIONAL]:** "Around mile 18, I started to lose my momentum. I was tired and irritable. I got frustrated easily and had to push my bike up a few hills, kicking myself for not being in better shape. I watched a gentleman with a small child strapped to his handlebars pass me, the kid waving and giggling as they passed. I was also passed by a group with toddler trailers attached, the kids happily bouncing along behind their parents. At this point I realized my second major mistake: I didn't pack snacks. I was excessively hangry." (https://www.thenxrth.com/post/mistakes-on-le-grand-du-nord-gravel-race)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**[COMPETITIVE] Bike Setup (Jamison):** Otso Fenrir geared for climbing and rough terrain with a max gear-inch of ~22mph. "From a pure math perspective (gear inches) I top out at ~22mph. At that point I'm out of gears and I'm just spinning... I spent the final four miles gently spinning my legs in circles for something to do as the bike hovered at its max speed." This setup was fine for the climbs but limiting on descents. (https://secondrunnings.me/2025/05/30/race-report-le-grand-du-nord-50-mile/)

**[COMPETITIVE] Single Speed Setup (Mike Ward):** Used 40t front / 15t rear (40/15 ratio) after much trial and error. Initially tried 17t rear (too much chain slack), then 16t (chain got jammed), then 15t (very hard gear but workable). "I figured I'd rather roll a hard gear ratio than a little bit lighter one, albeit one I was a lot more comfortable with, because the course was purportedly flatter and easier." Note: This is a VERY hard gear requiring significant strength. (https://www.mikeward.cool/blog/racing/le-grand-du-nord-race-report/)

**[ELITE] Wet Weather Experience (Mathew Wollmann):** "My bike was sounding like a heap of junk at this point, but still performing like a champ... My bike brakes.. Toast. The gravel and water were like a sandblaster ruining them." Wet conditions destroyed brake pads during the race. (https://www.mathewwollmann.com/post/le-grand-du-nord-2022-110-mile-race-review)

**[ELITE] Clothing for Rain/Cold (Mathew Wollmann):** "Fortunately, I had chosen to wear a light rain jacket over my short-sleeved jersey. Under that, I had very light arm warmers on as well, due to the high only being in the low 50s. I chose to go with regular bib shorts and booties over my shoes. Cycling gloves and a light headband for my ears rounded out the specifics." (https://www.mathewwollmann.com/post/le-grand-du-nord-2022-110-mile-race-review)

**[COMPETITIVE] Hydration Pack (Mike Ward):** Used a 50 oz. Camelbak Chase bike vest. "I also was very excited to use my new 50 oz. Camelbak Chase bike vest. Ummm, total thumbs up! Thing rocks!" (https://www.mikeward.cool/blog/racing/le-grand-du-nord-race-report/)

**[RECREATIONAL] DIY Cue Card Holder (Elena Willmot):** "My concoction ended up requiring a plastic sheet protector that held the cue card, a hole punch, duct tape, and several zip ties. My first rookie mistake was not testing my MacGyver set-up before the race... The plastic corner of my cue card set-up repeatedly scratched my knee with every pedal stroke." Test your equipment before race day! (https://www.thenxrth.com/post/mistakes-on-le-grand-du-nord-gravel-race)

**General Tire Recommendation (Official):** "We recommend bicycles that can fit tires 35-45 mm wide" for the 110-mile and 50-mile routes. For the 26-mile: "35-40 mm wide." (https://www.heckofthenorth.com/legrand-about/ and https://www.thenxrth.com/events/le-grand-du-nord)

## Weather Experienced

**May 2025 (50-mile):** "Saturday morning was nice and crisp with predicted high temps just above 50F°. There was some intermittent sun that made it occasionally feel warmer... The fact that the temperature didn't change much throughout the day was a huge bonus." (https://secondrunnings.me/2025/05/30/race-report-le-grand-du-nord-50-mile/)

**May 2022 (110-mile):** Heavy rain throughout the race. "The rain was NOT in my control... The rain had not let up. In fact, I think it had gotten worse." Temperatures in the low 50s. Within 10 minutes of finishing: "I was already shivering and ready to get cleaned up. It is amazing how quickly the body cools down after you are done pedaling." (https://www.mathewwollmann.com/post/le-grand-du-nord-2022-110-mile-race-review)

**May 2023 (100-mile):** "It was a beautiful night out... It was a perfect morning, nice and cool and the forecast was extremely encouraging. Light enough winds, not too hot, bright sun all day. Perfect." (https://www.mikeward.cool/blog/racing/le-grand-du-nord-race-report/)

**May 2021 (26-mile):** "The weather was expected to be near-perfect for a bike race with light winds, sun, and temperatures in the 50s." (https://www.thenxrth.com/post/mistakes-on-le-grand-du-nord-gravel-race)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**The Starting Climb:** Multiple riders note a very steep initial climb out of Grand Marais. "You leave town and head straight up. For 25 miles. That's just the nature of the beast when you start and end in a lake-side town next to the Sawtooth Mountains. Granted a 1200 foot difference doesn't sound like much to our mountain dwelling friends, but around here that's a solid climb." [COMPETITIVE] (https://secondrunnings.me/2025/05/30/race-report-le-grand-du-nord-50-mile/)

**Early Steep Hill (Mile 4, 26-mile course):** "At mile four, I turned a corner only to find myself gazing up a steep hill with at least 30 people scattered about, struggling to push their bikes up the hill. I knew this hill was coming, but it looked significantly more intimidating in person than it had on Google Maps." [RECREATIONAL] (https://www.thenxrth.com/post/mistakes-on-le-grand-du-nord-gravel-race)

**The Grade (50-mile):** "This is one of the better maintained forest service roads in the area and it connects a lot of trailheads and small lakes on this side of the Boundary Waters. My wife and I zipped along feeling pretty good throughout this section... It was also nice to get some relatively flat road for a while without the continual up and down of most of the other roads." [COMPETITIVE] (https://secondrunnings.me/2025/05/30/race-report-le-grand-du-nord-50-mile/)

**Moraine Ridge Section (50-mile):** "Riding along Devil's Track Lake gave us a brief moment of additional pavement before dumping us back onto the most beautiful gravel road along a moraine that you will find. Amazing pine forests with small lakes dotting the landscape as you roll along the gentle ridge line. This area was one of the biggest highlights of the ride for me." [COMPETITIVE] (https://secondrunnings.me/2025/05/30/race-report-le-grand-du-nord-50-mile/)

**Final Descent:** "We made one final turn down a big gravel hill and popped out back on County Road 7, a nicely paved 4.5 mile road back into town... I turned onto 3rd Avenue" with "a VERY steep downhill (into a very busy road)" at the finish. [COMPETITIVE] (https://secondrunnings.me/2025/05/30/race-report-le-grand-du-nord-50-mile/)

**110-Mile Rough Section:** "There is a 5 mile section of especially rough, rocky two track with a likely stream crossing (depending on the weather and local beaver activity.)" (https://www.heckofthenorth.com/legrand-about/)

**Race Start Traffic Light:** Multiple riders mention hitting a stoplight within the first 100 yards. "Within 100 yards, we hit a stoplight and waited for several cars to pass through. We all laughed, as it felt very anticlimactic." [COMPETITIVE & RECREATIONAL] (https://www.mikeward.cool/blog/racing/le-grand-du-nord-race-report/ and https://www.thenxrth.com/post/mistakes-on-le-grand-du-nord-gravel-race)

**Course Fog/Visibility:** "At one point I looked to my right, at a point of the route I had already ridden on the return portion, and saw what appeared to be a complete drop-off into the abyss. It was VERY foggy and hard to see very far in front of me. I thought to myself, holy hell thank goodness I didn't fly off that when I couldn't see a thing. As I stared at it, I realized that it was a lake, and the water was so still that the fog/sky was reflecting on it. It made it look like I was riding next to a cliff's edge." [ELITE] (https://www.mathewwollmann.com/post/le-grand-du-nord-2022-110-mile-race-review)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**[ELITE] Front Group Pacing (Mathew Wollmann):** "I found myself in the 400 - 500 watt range rather quickly and warmed up. I was holding strong with the front group, and when we hit the flats it was game on. Follow the leader, hang on, passing on the left type of racing." First checkpoint at mile 36. Note: 400-500W is elite-level power output. (https://www.mathewwollmann.com/post/le-grand-du-nord-2022-110-mile-race-review)

**[COMPETITIVE] Conservative Start Strategy (Mike Ward):** "I was at the front and didn't want to be there. I knew that if I got excited trying to stay with the lead group, I'd burn up and have a tough day. I absolutely had to stick back and be smart early on. My training was not optimal, my setup was questionable at best in terms of setting my legs up for an even-keeled day." Fell back deliberately, then rode his own race. (https://www.mikeward.cool/blog/racing/le-grand-du-nord-race-report/)

**[COMPETITIVE] Aid Station Strategy (Jamison, 50-mile):** At mile 22 aid station (Eagle Mountain trailhead): "I enjoyed some quality hummus and pickle wraps and a quick shot of Coke before heading back out." Later: "I could have eaten just a little bit more towards the end as by this point I had mostly burnt through everything I slammed at the aid station. I thankfully had some liquid calories that were still tasting good so I worked my way through those." Finished in 4:23:20. (https://secondrunnings.me/2025/05/30/race-report-le-grand-du-nord-50-mile/)

**[ELITE] Hydration in Cold/Rain (Mathew Wollmann):** "Here I filled up my bottles, leaving my camelback with whatever I had left. Due to the low temps, I was not drinking as much as I normally would." (https://www.mathewwollmann.com/post/le-grand-du-nord-2022-110-mile-race-review)

**Start Wave Strategy:** The 110-mile race starts in three separate waves, with competitive riders typically in later waves. (https://www.mathewwollmann.com/post/le-grand-du-nord-2022-110-mile-race-review)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Chain Failures (Pre-Race):** [COMPETITIVE] Mike Ward experienced chain failure during setup: "I set off to ride two blocks back home, and when I stood up and pressed on the pedals, a crack erupted. I looked down to see my chain dragging off of my bike, then slide off like a dead snake... I figured that breaking the chain over and over to repeatedly switch rear cogs over made it pretty fragile." (https://www.mikeward.cool/blog/racing/le-grand-du-nord-race-report/)

**Brake Destruction in Wet Conditions:** [ELITE] "My bike brakes.. Toast. The gravel and water were like a sandblaster ruining them." Wet gravel conditions can completely destroy brake pads during the race. (https://www.mathewwollmann.com/post/le-grand-du-nord-2022-110-mile-race-review)

**Bonking/Nutrition Failure:** [RECREATIONAL] Elena Willmot's experience around mile 18 of the 26-mile course: "I started to lose my momentum. I was tired and irritable... At this point I realized my second major mistake: I didn't pack snacks. I was excessively hangry. I slogged through the last 8 miles in a state of misery." (https://www.thenxrth.com/post/mistakes-on-le-grand-du-nord-gravel-race)

**Visibility Issues in Rain:** [ELITE] "20 miles in there was no way I was seeing out of my sunglasses, and all I could do was hold the wheel in front... I couldn't read my Garmin due to the mud." (https://www.mathewwollmann.com/post/le-grand-du-nord-2022-110-mile-race-review)

**Equipment Not Tested:** [RECREATIONAL] "My first rookie mistake was not testing my MacGyver set-up before the race" - cue card holder scratched knee throughout race. (https://www.thenxrth.com/post/mistakes-on-le-grand-du-nord-gravel-race)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Small-Town Finish:** "Ending a race into a very small-town downtown is such a different thing than finishing in a campground or in the middle of the woods. They're all great and fun ways to finish, but the small-town finish is something unique. There's people around watching, and people going about their day. You've just spent the entire morning in some of the most isolated parts of the state, and then boom, you're surrounded by cheering and activity and energy. It's a fun way to wrap up a day." [COMPETITIVE] (https://secondrunnings.me/2025/05/30/race-report-le-grand-du-nord-50-mile/)

**Social Event:** "It's common to run into people you know. That aspect became a theme for the weekend with us never being able to get too far in town without bumping into someone. Hilariously, after the race it took us an hour to walk the short walk back to town for food and beer because we kept stopping to chat with people. A few of whom weren't even in town for the race but just visiting the area!" [COMPETITIVE] (https://secondrunnings.me/2025/05/30/race-report-le-grand-du-nord-50-mile/)

**Supportive Community:** [RECREATIONAL] Elena Willmot dropped her water bottle while riding: "As I turned around to pick it up, no fewer than 3 people asked if I was okay and if I needed any help. In that moment, although embarrassed, I knew I wouldn't get lost or be left behind." (https://www.thenxrth.com/post/mistakes-on-le-grand-du-nord-gravel-race)

**Post-Race Celebration:** "We hung out for a while to watch some other friends finish and then the chill of our sweat got to be too much and we had to head back to the van to change and get warm. We relaxed for a short bit and then headed back to the brewery for a celebratory beer and food, and more visiting with friends." [COMPETITIVE] (https://secondrunnings.me/2025/05/30/race-report-le-grand-du-nord-50-mile/)

**Packet Pickup/Pre-Race:** Held at Voyageur Brewing Company with Friday night events including live music and food. (https://secondrunnings.me/2025/05/30/race-report-le-grand-du-nord-50-mile/ and https://www.heckofthenorth.com/legrand-about/)

**Post-Race Beer:** "A cool Le Grand du Nord-Voyageur Brewing Company pint glass (for you to keep) filled with one of Minnesota's best craft beers post race courtesy of Le Grand and Voyageur Brewing Co." (https://www.granfondoguide.com/Events/Index/5367/le-grand-du-nord)

**Community Reflection:** [COMPETITIVE] "We sat on the Voyageur Brewing deck soaking in the sunshine and reflecting on the past several months - how motivating it had been to have this goal to work towards and how biking, in general, had really brought us through the difficulty of pandemic isolation." (https://www.thenxrth.com/post/mistakes-on-le-grand-du-nord-gravel-race)

**Unofficial Aid:** [ELITE] "Cheers to the good ol' boys slinging Hamm's at mile 60; morale in a can!" (https://www.mathewwollmann.com/post/le-grand-du-nord-2022-110-mile-race-review)
