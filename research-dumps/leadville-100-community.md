# LEADVILLE TRAIL 100 MTB — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Rachel Hwang [COMPETITIVE]:** "Every time someone passed me, I told myself there was 105 miles of this, and to not make the mistake of burning myself out too early. My goal was to get under 9hrs for a large belt buckle, and learnings from Tahoe Trail, to pace and not cramp." (https://www.altovelo.org/race-reports/race-report-2024-leadville-trail-100-mtb)

**Rachel Hwang [COMPETITIVE]:** "I had started out with 23/25PSI front/back and was so extremely saddle sore. When I got to the rest stop before the large climb, I let out about 5PSI per tire and it felt infinitely better and comfier. Definitely running 20s from the start next time." (https://www.altovelo.org/race-reports/race-report-2024-leadville-trail-100-mtb)

**Rachel Hwang [COMPETITIVE]:** "Near the top of the climb, the air was thin, my legs were cramping, and I got off like most of the people around me to walk up the chunky loose rock climb up, single file, as people one after another came racing down right next to us." (https://www.altovelo.org/race-reports/race-report-2024-leadville-trail-100-mtb)

**Rachel Hwang [COMPETITIVE]:** "By that point, I wasn't thinking of nutrition anymore. My bottle an hour turned into maybe a bottle every 2 hours. I was already under fueling, and after that, severely behind, but my mouth could not stomach any more hydration mix so had a bottle of just water on my bike." (https://www.altovelo.org/race-reports/race-report-2024-leadville-trail-100-mtb)

**Rachel Hwang [COMPETITIVE]:** "On that climb, it started hailing on us. I hate rain. I'm like a cat, but in those few miles, I soaked it all in – specifically in my legs. It drastically helped with the cramping from that point on and it didn't feel like I was constantly on the verge of cramping anymore." (https://www.altovelo.org/race-reports/race-report-2024-leadville-trail-100-mtb)

**Rachel Hwang [COMPETITIVE]:** "Ended with an official time of 9:44:33. Wish I did better, but as my Strava description says, I gave it everything I had and if that's the result I got, that's where I stand in my endurance, skills, athleticism. Honestly, for not having a structured training plan, and always making last minute adjustments to my bike, I did pretty well." (https://www.altovelo.org/race-reports/race-report-2024-leadville-trail-100-mtb)

**Victoria Weeks [UNKNOWN]:** "This race signifies more than a mythical cycling event or physical challenge. The aspiration to finish in twelve hours, to earn the small belt buckle and the finisher's medal, isn't driven by bragging rights. For most of us mere mortals, it is a test of spirit, with the 12-hour course symbolizing life's peaks and valleys as we navigate our short time on this magnificent planet." (https://www.victoriaweeks.com/race-report-leadville-trail-100-mtb/)

**Victoria Weeks [UNKNOWN]:** "The white corral was subdivided into three self-organized waves and represented almost ⅓ of the racers." (https://www.victoriaweeks.com/race-report-leadville-trail-100-mtb/)

**Victoria Weeks [UNKNOWN]:** "The steepest part of the grade is around 13%, with an average of 6.3%. The road continued disintegrating beneath us, with ruts, loose dirt, and large rocks becoming our surface. As on most of the rocky ascents on this course, there is a prominent line threading through the chaos. But there is also a wall of people almost trail-wide, many walking." (https://www.victoriaweeks.com/race-report-leadville-trail-100-mtb/)

**Coach Sophie Evans [RECREATIONAL]:** "For those who are unable to travel to Leadville, never fear! You can still prepare for this course by focusing on: Building your endurance. Plan for long rides working at an aerobic effort. As much as possible, find terrain that will help you mimic the features of the course." (https://nolimitsendurance.com/riding-across-the-sky-leadville-100-mountain-bike-race-report/)

**Coach Sophie Evans [RECREATIONAL]:** "Most of the climb is a clean, switch-backing jeep road that allows you to just put your head down and grind your way up. The last couple of miles the road narrows and is super steep with loose dirt and big rocks. I knew it was coming and once you hit this section you can see the top far off in the distance. This is where my heart sank! This is where all I could see was a line of dismounted riders walking their bikes in single file." (https://nolimitsendurance.com/riding-across-the-sky-leadville-100-mountain-bike-race-report/)

**Coach Sophie Evans [RECREATIONAL]:** "If you don't live at altitude, your best defense (and offense) for the high altitude is to get as fit as you possibly can. A key part of this recipe should include some higher-intensity interval training. This will help build your cardiovascular capacity and complement the endurance and strength work you are doing." (https://nolimitsendurance.com/riding-across-the-sky-leadville-100-mountain-bike-race-report/)

**Michael Macatula [COMPETITIVE]:** "My mileage ramped up over the course of this period to peak at 50-55 mpw, with quite a bit of 18-22 milers, a lot of speed and tempo work, and just overall building a ton of aerobic capacity and endurance overall." (https://paacycling.net/content.aspx?page_id=2507&club_id=45054&item_id=3074&pst=15460)

**Michael Macatula [COMPETITIVE]:** "Pre-riding the first third of the course on the second day of altitude acclimation proved a sobering reality; I kept thinking 'Who was I kidding thinking I could finish this race in under 10 hours?!?!' Gasping for air on the short climbs and nearly losing a quarter of my power that I had at sea-level, I realized that I should revise my goal." (https://paacycling.net/content.aspx?page_id=2507&club_id=45054&item_id=3074&pst=15460)

**Michael Macatula [COMPETITIVE]:** "Over the first outbound summits and 40 or so miles, I kept my pace and felt fine with a big smile ready for those race-day pics if any photographers were quick to snap me. Feeling great before tackling the highest summit on Columbine, I pull into my crewed aid station like a wannabe F1 racer for a hydration pack re-fill when my buddy's wife asks 'Your pack is still 2/3 full, are you drinking enough?'" (https://paacycling.net/content.aspx?page_id=2507&club_id=45054&item_id=3074&pst=15460)

**Michael Macatula [COMPETITIVE]:** "Two-thirds through the Columbine climb emerging from the tree-line, I became dismayed as I encountered a conga line of dismounted riders hiking the rest of the summit as I emerged around a corner! This was the infamous hike-a-bike section everyone was talking about, just one of several forthcoming on the inbound leg of the race." (https://paacycling.net/content.aspx?page_id=2507&club_id=45054&item_id=3074&pst=15460)

**Michael Macatula [COMPETITIVE]:** "Then came the inbound climb on Powerline around mile 80, which quickly became my second test of willpower. It was another line of hike-a-bike riders which felt like another almost hour-long crawl due to incomprehensible fatigue." (https://paacycling.net/content.aspx?page_id=2507&club_id=45054&item_id=3074&pst=15460)

**Michael Macatula [COMPETITIVE]:** "Approaching the end of the climb, I could see the finish line. The energized, cheering crowds seemed to magnetically pull me in effortlessly as I rolled through the finish at 11 hours, 52 minutes, and 49 seconds." (https://paacycling.net/content.aspx?page_id=2507&club_id=45054&item_id=3074&pst=15460)

**Chris, Craig, and Seth [ELITE]:** "If you have an aggressive time goal — e.g., finishing in less than 9 hours to earn the big belt buckle — then starting as far up as possible is advantageous. The farther back you are, the more likely it is that you will get held up by other riders on the tough climbs." (https://www.theproscloset.com/blogs/news/race-tips-from-leadville-trail-100-mtb-finishers)

**Chris [ELITE]:** "Starting in the very back actually isn't that bad if you aren't trying to race. Because most of the riders around him weren't charging or being aggressive, he was able to move at an easy pace for most of the day. By the time he reached Powerline climb, he said he still felt 'fresh.'" (https://www.theproscloset.com/blogs/news/race-tips-from-leadville-trail-100-mtb-finishers)

**Craig [ELITE]:** "His biggest regret was not bringing someone to provide support. Leadville does have a drop bag service, so it's not required, but having to stop and wait for a volunteer to find your drop bag can cost valuable time. Craig stopped nearly three times longer at the Twin Lakes support area than his friend who had someone to hand him more bottles and nutrition." (https://www.theproscloset.com/blogs/news/race-tips-from-leadville-trail-100-mtb-finishers)

**Troy Templin [UNKNOWN]:** "In 2019 a friend of mine, David, and I decided to put that to the test. David is younger and stronger than me but had only been to Leadville once as crew for me. David rode a gravel bike, while I decided to ride a 120mm bike to expand the difference in bike choice further... Neither David nor I had any mechanicals or issues, but at the end of the day, the MTB did win." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/the-leadville-trail-100-mtb-is-a-gravel-bike-a-good-choice/)

**Troy Templin [UNKNOWN]:** "David had some very fast segments, but the gravel bike was not enough when the going got rough and rider traffic limits your line choice." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/the-leadville-trail-100-mtb-is-a-gravel-bike-a-good-choice/)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Tire Pressure [COMPETITIVE]:** Rachel Hwang started with 23/25 PSI front/back but found it too harsh on her sit bones. After dropping to ~18/20 PSI it felt "infinitely better and comfier. Definitely running 20s from the start next time." (https://www.altovelo.org/race-reports/race-report-2024-leadville-trail-100-mtb)

**Saddle Issues [COMPETITIVE]:** Rachel Hwang noted cramping issues related to her new saddle: "By the way the cramping has only happened to me during races on this new saddle so I'm certain at this point it's the saddle." (https://www.altovelo.org/race-reports/race-report-2024-leadville-trail-100-mtb)

**Hydration Packs vs. Bottles [ELITE]:** "All three of our finishers agreed that none of them would use a hydration pack in the first half of the race. The temps are cool and there are plenty of opportunities to refill along the course. If you have a support person/crew with you, they can hand you bottles at the support areas. This way, you don't need to carry extra weight on your back during the tough Columbine climb, which comes at the halfway point of the race. Craig's suggestion was to take a hydration pack at the Twin Lakes support area after completing Columbine. By then, temps will be hotter and the pack will be more useful." (https://www.theproscloset.com/blogs/news/race-tips-from-leadville-trail-100-mtb-finishers)

**NOTE:** The hydration pack advice is from elite-level finishers who are racing hard. Recreational riders may prefer a pack from the start for consistency and simplicity.

**Hardtail vs. Full-Suspension [ELITE]:** "All three riders agreed that they'd prefer riding a full-suspension bike at Leadville. Yes, a hardtail would be lighter, and maybe more efficient (and Keegan Swenson set the Leadville course record on a hardtail), but the extra comfort and confidence of rear suspension might be the better choice for most amateur riders. For most riders, a full-suspension mountain bike will be faster on the rough descents. On the climbs, it will provide more traction and allow you to stay seated and maintain your pedaling posture and cadence over rocks and rough sections." (https://www.theproscloset.com/blogs/news/race-tips-from-leadville-trail-100-mtb-finishers)

**Dropper Seatpost [ELITE/MIXED]:** "Craig chose a rigid seatpost to save weight for the climbs and didn't feel like it held him back on the descents at all. If you're less comfortable riding off-road though, the added weight might be worth it for the confidence boost." (https://www.theproscloset.com/blogs/news/race-tips-from-leadville-trail-100-mtb-finishers)

**Gravel Bike Suitability [UNKNOWN]:** Troy Templin's 2019 test with his friend David showed that while a gravel bike with 650b MTB tires is viable, "the gravel bike was not enough when the going got rough and rider traffic limits your line choice... Leadville is not a gravel race. It is still a mountain bike event that is a great option for gravel riders to try on a mountain bike." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/the-leadville-trail-100-mtb-is-a-gravel-bike-a-good-choice/)

**Gravel Bike Gearing [UNKNOWN]:** "Many gravel bikes will have the same 1x cassettes as the mountain bikes but a much larger chainring. Getting that combination correct will be the biggest limiting factor of a gravel bike." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/the-leadville-trail-100-mtb-is-a-gravel-bike-a-good-choice/)

**Trekking Poles:** Multiple sources confirm poles are allowed and recommended for Hope Pass and Powerline climb. Muling (carrying runner's supplies) is allowed, so competitive runners often hand poles to pacers after climbs. Solo runners typically drop poles at Twin Lakes for pickup. (https://www.altovelo.org/race-reports/race-report-2024-leadville-trail-100-mtb and https://www.theproscloset.com/blogs/news/race-tips-from-leadville-trail-100-mtb-finishers)

## Weather Experienced

**2024 Race [COMPETITIVE]:** Rachel Hwang reported: "The weather forecast was mostly sunny, no rain – the most important part – and good temperature for climbing and descending." Later in the race: "On that climb, it started hailing on us. I hate rain. I'm like a cat, but in those few miles, I soaked it all in – specifically in my legs. It drastically helped with the cramping from that point on." (https://www.altovelo.org/race-reports/race-report-2024-leadville-trail-100-mtb)

**2025 Race Conditions:** "Dusty conditions. Gusty Winds. Record Times." The race saw cool conditions with minimal wind, contributing to new course records. (https://leadville100podcast.com/website/2025-lt100-race-recap)

**2023 Race Start [UNKNOWN]:** Victoria Weeks noted: "On race day, despite an uneasy sleep, I was relatively calm... I wore an oversized blue hoodie to stay warm, which I planned to donate to the crowd once the race began." Start time is 6:30 AM with temperatures around freezing. (https://www.victoriaweeks.com/race-report-leadville-trail-100-mtb/)

**2021 Race [COMPETITIVE]:** Michael Macatula described conditions: "Race morning was cold as we lined up in our starting corrals. It is typical for Leadville mornings to be chilly, so be prepared for this likelihood." (https://paacycling.net/content.aspx?page_id=2507&club_id=45054&item_id=3074&pst=15460)

**2013 Post-Rain Conditions [UNKNOWN]:** Troy Templin noted after a rainstorm the night before: "Thanks to the rainstorm the night before, it was in the best shape I'd seen it, beautifully darkened by moisture, tacky, and almost dust-free." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/the-leadville-trail-100-mtb-is-a-gravel-bike-a-good-choice/)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**First Climb - St. Kevin's [UNKNOWN]:** Victoria Weeks described: "The steepest part of the grade is around 13%, with an average of 6.3%. The road continued disintegrating beneath us, with ruts, loose dirt, and large rocks becoming our surface. As on most of the rocky ascents on this course, there is a prominent line threading through the chaos. But there is also a wall of people almost trail-wide, many walking." (https://www.victoriaweeks.com/race-report-leadville-trail-100-mtb/)

**Powerline Descent [UNKNOWN]:** Victoria Weeks: "At around mile 19, I crested the top of Powerline, more than ready to take on the descent. The next few miles are some of the most famous of the race—a rocky, deeply rutted 4x4 access road weaves through the towering, buzzing powerlines." (https://www.victoriaweeks.com/race-report-leadville-trail-100-mtb/)

**Powerline Climb Statistics [ELITE]:** "The Powerline climb is a notoriously brutal 3.38-mile section with an average grade of 7.4%, topping out at a punishing 25% in some places." (https://silca.cc/blogs/silca/2025-leadville-100-mtb)

**Columbine Climb [COMPETITIVE]:** Rachel Hwang: "The climb was brutally long, but not difficult. About halfway up... Near the top, was some of the most beautiful views I have seen in a while, mainly due to the never ending line of mountain bikers going up the beautiful mountain backdrop." Near the top: "the air was thin, my legs were cramping, and I got off like most of the people around me to walk up the chunky loose rock climb up, single file, as people one after another came racing down right next to us." (https://www.altovelo.org/race-reports/race-report-2024-leadville-trail-100-mtb)

**Columbine Details [RECREATIONAL]:** Sophie Evans: "This is a brutal 8-mile climb, with loose dirt and rock that ascends to 12,600 ft... Most of the climb is a clean, switch-backing jeep road that allows you to just put your head down and grind your way up. The last couple of miles the road narrows and is super steep with loose dirt and big rocks." (https://nolimitsendurance.com/riding-across-the-sky-leadville-100-mountain-bike-race-report/)

**Traffic Management:** Michael Macatula on Columbine: "The top portion of Columbine is tough as the wide fire road turns to a narrower double track. For those in the front, it gives them plenty of real estate to choose a line. But for the rest of us, it is single file as the leaders are coming down. This means you can get stuck at the pace of the person in front of you, and having easier gears might be essential." (https://paacycling.net/content.aspx?page_id=2507&club_id=45054&item_id=3074&pst=15460)

**CDT Section [COMPETITIVE]:** Michael Macatula: "at about mile 36 we reached the Mt. Elbert water station, which is not actually at Mt. Elbert but rather the intersection of the trail to the summit and the Continental Divide Trail. We followed the CDT down the 3 most brilliantly beautiful miles on course: a fast but runnable section between the Aspens, overlooking Twin Lakes." (https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/6w19ak/race_report_the_grand_slam_leg_3_the_leadville/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Early Pace Control [COMPETITIVE]:** Rachel Hwang: "I stayed pretty far back in the coral as I had a feeling I would be passed by a lot of the people. My assumption was correct, and I never stopped getting passed. Every time someone passed me, I told myself there was 105 miles of this, and to not make the mistake of burning myself out too early." Her goal was sub-9 hours; she finished in 9:44:33. (https://www.altovelo.org/race-reports/race-report-2024-leadville-trail-100-mtb)

**Altitude Impact [COMPETITIVE]:** Michael Macatula on pre-riding at altitude: "Gasping for air on the short climbs and nearly losing a quarter of my power that I had at sea-level, I realized that I should revise my goal." He noted that above 10,000 ft, "it gets a lot harder to breathe. With less oxygen available, you produce less power and it's harder to recover from hard efforts." (https://paacycling.net/content.aspx?page_id=2507&club_id=45054&item_id=3074&pst=15460 and https://www.theproscloset.com/blogs/news/race-tips-from-leadville-trail-100-mtb-finishers)

**Nutrition Strategy [COMPETITIVE - Rachel Hwang]:** Attempted "one bottle per hour of ~30-35g carb drink mix (Torq and Tailwind) with one gel every hour (Torq, SIS, sponsored Precision Fuel), + aid station banana, coke." However, she fell behind on nutrition: "By that point, I wasn't thinking of nutrition anymore. My bottle an hour turned into maybe a bottle every 2 hours. I was already under fueling, and after that, severely behind, but my mouth could not stomach any more hydration mix so had a bottle of just water on my bike." (https://www.altovelo.org/race-reports/race-report-2024-leadville-trail-100-mtb)

**WARNING:** Rachel's nutrition plan was for a sub-9-hour goal (she finished 9:44). Slower finishers will need different fueling strategies.

**Hydration Monitoring [COMPETITIVE]:** Michael Macatula's experience: "Feeling great before tackling the highest summit on Columbine, I pull into my crewed aid station like a wannabe F1 racer for a hydration pack re-fill when my buddy's wife asks 'Your pack is still 2/3 full, are you drinking enough?'" He notes he has a known "drinking problem – not hydrating enough while on the saddle." (https://paacycling.net/content.aspx?page_id=2507&club_id=45054&item_id=3074&pst=15460)

**Mental Preparation [UNKNOWN]:** Craig explained that at altitude "you go into 'dark places' mentally more quickly. It's important to be aware of this. You need to meter your efforts a lot more than you would at lower elevations so you don't go too deep and blow up." (https://www.theproscloset.com/blogs/news/race-tips-from-leadville-trail-100-mtb-finishers)

**Course Recon Benefits [RECREATIONAL]:** Sophie Evans: "If you have the means, then I highly recommend pre-riding sections of this course. I set aside a weekend in July to pre-ride the course in Leadville. That weekend was invaluable as there is nothing better than Leadville itself to prepare you for this adventure." (https://nolimitsendurance.com/riding-across-the-sky-leadville-100-mountain-bike-race-report/)

**Starting Position Strategy [ELITE/COMPETITIVE]:** "If you have an aggressive time goal — e.g., finishing in less than 9 hours to earn the big belt buckle — then starting as far up as possible is advantageous. The farther back you are, the more likely it is that you will get held up by other riders on the tough climbs. Once someone in front of you is forced to get off and walk, everyone directly behind them has to walk too." However, Chris noted that "starting in the very back actually isn't that bad if you aren't trying to race... he was able to move at an easy pace for most of the day." (https://www.theproscloset.com/blogs/news/race-tips-from-leadville-trail-100-mtb-finishers)

**Descent Tactics [RECREATIONAL]:** Sophie Evans on the Columbine descent: "If you haven't already gotten this message: if you have time goals, do a qualifier to get in a better corral! I decided once I had a clear trail ahead of me to just go for it…both frightening and risky with 2-way traffic, I just let 'er rip! It's in these moments in races that I unlock a new level of riding that I would never have attempted in practice…on the very edge of control!" (https://nolimitsendurance.com/riding-across-the-sky-leadville-100-mountain-bike-race-report/)

## DNF Risk Factors

**High DNF Rate [UNKNOWN]:** Troy Templin notes: "Leadville is somewhat notorious for its high (~50%) DNF rate, despite its relatively benign course. While a portion of that is due to the altitude, of course, an even greater amount is due to the lack of experience of the field: there is no qualifier required to run the 100, and it has enough prestige that a bunch of weekend warriors sign up for it, because how hard could 100 be, right? Even the winners run slower than 10 minute miles!" (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/the-leadville-trail-100-mtb-is-a-gravel-bike-a-good-choice/)

**Traffic Jams on Climbs [MULTIPLE SOURCES]:** Victoria Weeks: "It may sound like an excuse, but this traffic jam is the harsh reality of starting in the white corral." Sophie Evans described the same phenomenon: "This is where all I could see was a line of dismounted riders walking their bikes in single file. It's single file because we share the road with riders coming down from the top and turn around point. There was no room to maneuver my bike around this walk line, so I was soon forced off my bike." (https://www.victoriaweeks.com/race-report-leadville-trail-100-mtb/ and https://nolimitsendurance.com/riding-across-the-sky-leadville-100-mountain-bike-race-report/)

**Altitude Effects [COMPETITIVE]:** Michael Macatula: "Gasping for air on the short climbs and nearly losing a quarter of my power that I had at sea-level." Craig noted you go into "dark places mentally more quickly" at altitude. (https://paacycling.net/content.aspx?page_id=2507&club_id=45054&item_id=3074&pst=15460 and https://www.theproscloset.com/blogs/news/race-tips-from-leadville-trail-100-mtb-finishers)

**Nutrition Failure [COMPETITIVE]:** Rachel Hwang's experience of falling behind on nutrition around mile 80: "By that point, I wasn't thinking of nutrition anymore. My bottle an hour turned into maybe a bottle every 2 hours. I was already under fueling." (https://www.altovelo.org/race-reports/race-report-2024-leadville-trail-100-mtb)

**Powerline Climb Breaking Point [COMPETITIVE]:** Michael Macatula: "Then came the inbound climb on Powerline around mile 80, which quickly became my second test of willpower. It was another line of hike-a-bike riders which felt like another almost hour-long crawl due to incomprehensible fatigue." The summary notes "Powerline is notorious for breaking spirits." (https://paacycling.net/content.aspx?page_id=2507&club_id=45054&item_id=3074&pst=15460)

**Mental Fatigue [COMPETITIVE]:** Michael Macatula around mile 80-90: "With no one around me to ride with, I was getting both physically and mentally tired. This is where I should have been eating more, but I got lazy (do as I say not as I do!)." (https://paacycling.net/content.aspx?page_id=2507&club_id=45054&item_id=3074&pst=15460)

**Early Mechanical [COMPETITIVE]:** Rachel Hwang mentions her teammate Kelly "flatted out about 10 miles into the race and is far behind. RIP. A while later, I saw Kelly roll past the finish line... For having flatted out early in the race, she crushed it physically and mentally." (https://www.altovelo.org/race-reports/race-report-2024-leadville-trail-100-mtb)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Founding Story:** The race was founded in 1983 by Ken Chlouber to help revitalize Leadville's economy after mine closures. "In the early 1980s, after the Climax Mine largely shut down, local resident Ken Chlouber sought a way to revitalize the town's economy. His solution? A 100-mile ultramarathon." The MTB race was added in 1994. (https://silca.cc/blogs/silca/2025-leadville-100-mtb)

**Ken Chlouber and Merilee Maupin [UNKNOWN]:** Victoria Weeks: "As the founders of the original LT100 foot and MTB races, Ken Chlouber and Merilee Maupin are heroes of Leadville lore. Recently, Ken has experienced some health problems, but he still makes every effort to rouse the crowd at athlete meetings and startlines... Shortly after passing by Merilee, I came upon Ken, sitting in a camp chair, vigorously waving his walking stick and calling out cheers to riders. I had yet to meet Ken or Merilee, so I took this chance to shout back with the loudest 'Thank you, you rock!' I could muster. I heard Ken laugh with gusto: 'You rock!' It was a huge emotional boost that carried me all the way up Sugarloaf to the top of Powerline with a smile on my face." (https://www.victoriaweeks.com/race-report-leadville-trail-100-mtb/)

**Start Line Atmosphere [COMPETITIVE]:** Michael Macatula: "The anthem was sung, cheers were had, and Chlouber emptied a 12 gauge into the cool, 36-degree morning air, and we were off." (https://paacycling.net/content.aspx?page_id=2507&club_id=45054&item_id=3074&pst=15460)

**Finish Line Experience [COMPETITIVE]:** Michael Macatula: "Approaching the end of the climb, I could see the finish line. The energized, cheering crowds seemed to magnetically pull me in effortlessly as I rolled through the finish... A cold wet towel placed on my back and a finisher's medal hung on my neck by a cheering volunteer made it feel that much better!" Rachel Hwang: "Merilee welcomes every racer who crosses the line with a hug and a finisher's medal." (https://paacycling.net/content.aspx?page_id=2507&club_id=45054&item_id=3074&pst=15460 and https://www.victoriaweeks.com/race-report-leadville-trail-100-mtb/)
