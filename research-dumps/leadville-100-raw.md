The sub-9 “big buckle” is especially challenging – only a relatively small percentage of the field makes it. For example, finishing under 9 hours often requires a **top 10-15%** caliber ride (e.g. in one recent year ~150–200 riders out of ~1600 finished <9h). Finishing under 12 hours is more common (the majority of starters do finish under 12h; one year saw 1538 finishers out of 1561 starters<u>[trainright.com](https://trainright.com/leadville-100-problem-women-representation/#:~:text=Working%20an%20aid%20station%20at,and%20that%E2%80%99s%20a%20problem)</u><u>[trainright.com](https://trainright.com/leadville-100-problem-women-representation/#:~:text=1538%20finishers%20,and%20that%E2%80%99s%20a%20problem)</u>, indicating a high completion rate in good conditions). But **any finish** in Leadville is an achievement; those missing the 12h cut receive no buckle (and are listed as DNF).

This means riders are performing in air with 30-40% less oxygen than at sea level – a huge physiological demand. The thin air is a defining aspect of the Leadville 100’s difficulty (more on this in *Altitude Impact* below).
**Historical Note:** The Leadville Trail 100 MTB was first run in 1994, created by Ken Chlouber as a sister event to the Leadville 100 Run (started 1983) to boost the local economy after a mine closure<u>[leadvilleraceseries.com](https://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/mtb/leadvilletrail100mtb/#:~:text=In%201994%2C%20150%20gutsy%20riders,The%20red%20carpet%20awaits)</u><u>[trainright.com](https://trainright.com/understanding-challenges-of-high-altitude-racing-at-the-leadville-100-and-usa-pro-cycling-challenge/#:~:text=Once%20you%20get%20above%20about,You%E2%80%99ll%20be%20slower%20riding)</u>.

But despite the hype at the front, Leadville keeps an inclusive spirit – the slogan “You’re better than you think you are, you can do more than you think you can” is a mantra from the founders to every finisher.
## **TERRAIN & COURSE**
The **Leadville 100 MTB course** is a 104-mile out-and-back (52 miles out to Columbine Mine, then 52 miles back) through high-altitude Rocky Mountain terrain<u>[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadville_Trail_100_MTB#:~:text=The%20race%20is%20run%20on,way%20point%20at%20the%20Columbine)</u>. Don’t expect much technical singletrack – in fact, **the course is mostly dirt/fire roads, double-track, and some paved segments**, with very little singletrack trail. It’s sometimes jokingly called “a gravel race at altitude” rather than a typical mountain bike trail race. Only about **1-2 miles of the 104 are true singletrack**; the rest is jeep road, gravel or pavement<u>[facebook.com](https://www.facebook.com/CyclingWeekly/posts/has-leadville-100-become-a-gravel-racewhy-are-pros-racing-the-biggest-mtb-race-i/1170534518437150/#:~:text=Has%20Leadville%20100%20become%20a,the%20entire%20104%20mile%20race)</u><u>[cyclingweekly.com](https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/why-pros-are-racing-the-biggest-mtb-race-in-the-us-on-drop-bars-and-frankenstein-bikes#:~:text=Over%20its%20decades,given%20its%20mountain%20bike%20title)</u>. One cycling journalist noted Leadville has a “surprisingly small amount of singletrack given its mountain bike title”<u>[cyclingweekly.com](https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/why-pros-are-racing-the-biggest-mtb-race-in-the-us-on-drop-bars-and-frankenstein-bikes#:~:text=Over%20its%20decades,given%20its%20mountain%20bike%20title)</u>. This means technical skills take a backseat to aerobic endurance, climbing legs, and the ability to ride fast on rolling dirt roads. Riders often use equipment more akin to gravel or cross-country racing (light hardtail bikes, semi-slick tires, even aero bars or drop bars in some cases – see *Equipment* section).
**Course Layout:** The race starts in downtown Leadville (on 6th & Harrison) with a paved rollout that quickly turns onto dirt. The route then roughly goes: **St. Kevins climb** → **Sugarloaf Pass climb** → **Powerline descent** → dirt & pavement to **Pipeline aid** → rolling roads to **Twin Lakes** → **Columbine climb** (turnaround at the top) → then return the same way (Twin Lakes, Pipeline, and finally climbing *up* Powerline and descending St. Kevins back to town). It is truly out-and-back except for slight deviations near the start/finish. Notably, the final miles do **not finish the way they started**: instead of a straight shot back on the paved road into town, riders are routed onto the dirt “Boulevard” climb and some mining roads before dropping to the finish. This adds a sting in the tail: the race is actually about **103–105 miles** long, and those “bonus” miles at the end *feel* extra hard<u>[leadvilleraceseries.com](https://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/dispatches-from-columbine-top-10-things-to-know-before-your-first-leadville-trail-100-mtb/#:~:text=3,last%20three%20feel%20extremely%20hard)</u>.

* **Sugarloaf Pass:** A climb on a mix of dirt road and rocky jeep trail, coming after St. Kevins. It’s less steep but gains another ~1,000+ ft, topping out ~11,000 ft. Near the summit of Sugarloaf, the course turns downward sharply – into the infamous **Powerline Descent**.

But the reward is huge: after Columbine, you’ve done the biggest climb and you get to **descend 3,000 ft back down**. The Columbine descent is fast but can be scary: you’re bombing down loose rocks *while* slower riders are still coming up. Good bike handling and courtesy are a must.

By the bottom of Columbine, your arms may be jelly from braking and your nerves fried – but then you must refuel and turn your mind toward the final 40 miles back.
* **“The Boulevard” (Turquoise Lake Road):** After surviving Powerline on the return, riders face one *last* climb just a few miles from the finish. Known as “the Boulevard,” it’s a gradual dirt road climb (~3 miles, ~500 ft gain) that leads from the pavement back up toward Leadville’s outskirts. At this stage, it feels like it goes on forever. Rebecca Rusch noted how demoralizing it was her first year to be detoured off the smooth road onto a chunky climb when she thought the finish was near<u>[leadvilleraceseries.com](https://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/dispatches-from-columbine-top-10-things-to-know-before-your-first-leadville-trail-100-mtb/#:~:text=The%20finish%20is%20not%20the,course%20alone%20before%20race%20day)</u>. It’s not terribly steep, but after 100 miles, **any climb is painful**. Once you crest the Boulevard, it’s basically downhill pavement into town and the red carpet finish line on 6th Street. But many a rider has hit the Boulevard minutes shy of a buckle cutoff and had to dig deep. *“At the bottom of the Boulevard, I looked back and thought, I’m pretty sure that’s Ruth Winder coming for me.

**Terrain and Surface:** Overall, Leadville’s route is *not* very technical. The challenges are *endurance, altitude, and climbing*, not tricky obstacles.

There are only a few rocky sections: notably the Powerline descent and the very top of Columbine (both quite rough), plus some washboardy jeep roads. But there’s **minimal singletrack** and nothing like the technical rock gardens or drops you’d see in a typical mountain bike race.

Riders leaving Twin Lakes after ~10:50 are pulled (this ensures they have a chance to make the 12h finish).

No official time cutoff is given *at* Columbine in recent guides (the assumption is if you made Twin Lakes outbound by 10:50, you’ll reach Columbine before the Twin Lakes *inbound* cutoff). But practically, riders often aim for ~12:30–1:00 pm latest at the summit to be safe for the return. The **race midpoint (time-wise)** is deceptive: climbing Columbine can take far longer than descending it, so don’t think of the 52-mile mark as half your total time.

This is an absolute time check – if you aren’t out of Twin Lakes by 2:35 pm (8 hours after the start gun), officials will pull you.

At this station (often last chance before Powerline climb), you’re ~22 miles from the finish, but those include Powerline and the Boulevard. 4:00 pm cut-off here means ~9.5 hours race time – if you depart after 4pm, they won’t let you continue.

This is essentially the last cutoff before the finish. It’s about 11.5 hours race time. If you leave Carter Summit after 6:20, you cannot make the 12h finish, so that’s the end. At this point there’s ~13 miles to go, mostly downhill then the Boulevard.

The *“final finisher”* often comes in just seconds under 12h amid huge cheers. Finishers under 9:00:00 earn the big buckle (there’s even a special shooting-off of a shotgun at 3:30 pm to mark the 9h cutoff – historically they’d fire a shotgun at 12h and 9h)<u>[leadvilleraceseries.com](https://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024_EVCO-LRS_100MTB_AthleteGuide.pdf#:~:text=9,RACE%20AWARDS)</u>. Finishers 9–12h get the small buckle. And at 12h, Merilee (the race co-founder) traditionally stands at the line to hug or console riders who missed the cutoff.
The **checkpoint splits** for a *sub-9 pace* roughly are: St Kevins ~0:50, Twin Lakes outbound ~2:45, Columbine turnaround ~4:30-4:40, Twin Lakes inbound ~5:00, Powerline summit ~7:25, Finish ~8:45-9:00<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/leadville-100-mtb-2019/9737?page=2#:~:text=For%20sub%209%3A)</u><u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/leadville-100-mtb-2019/9737?page=2#:~:text=Pipeline%20Return%3A%20,Blvd%2Fbeginning%20of%20rock%20climb%3A%208%3A40)</u>. For a *sub-12 (just-barely) pace*: Twin Lakes outbound ~3:50, Columbine ~6:30, Twin Lakes inbound ~7:15, Powerline summit ~10:00-10:15, finish by 11:30-12:00. The time lost is mostly on the climbs and any issues (mechanicals, bonking, etc). Many riders will be *ahead* of cutoff schedule early on, only to slow dramatically on Columbine or Powerline as fatigue and altitude set in.
## **ALTITUDE IMPACT**
Racing the Leadville 100 is as much an **altitude challenge** as an endurance one. The entire course sits in thin air: 9,200 ft at its lowest, over 10,000 ft most of the way, and peaking ~12,500 ft. At these elevations, the human body simply cannot perform at full capacity – oxygen is too scarce.
**Performance Loss:** A common rule of thumb is that an athlete will lose about **~3% of their aerobic power per 1,000 feet above 5,000 ft**<u>[bicycling.com](https://www.bicycling.com/training/g20045947/this-is-your-body-on-altitude/#:~:text=The%20same%20hill%20you%20could,once%20you%20hit%20high%20altitude)</u>. By 10,000 feet, you’re operating with roughly **15% less power output** than at sea-level<u>[bicycling.com](https://www.bicycling.com/training/g20045947/this-is-your-body-on-altitude/#:~:text=The%20same%20hill%20you%20could,once%20you%20hit%20high%20altitude)</u>. (In other words, if your sea-level FTP is 300 W, at 10k ft it might effectively feel like ~255 W at threshold.) At the very top of the course (~12,000 ft), it gets worse: there’s about **40% fewer oxygen molecules per breath** than at sea level<u>[bicycling.com](https://www.bicycling.com/training/g20045947/this-is-your-body-on-altitude/#:~:text=As%20elevation%20rises%2C%20the%20air,fewer%20oxygen%20molecules%20per%20breath)</u>, and maximum sustainable power may drop to only **70–80% of sea-level values**<u>[trainright.com](https://trainright.com/understanding-challenges-of-high-altitude-racing-at-the-leadville-100-and-usa-pro-cycling-challenge/#:~:text=As%20you%20go%20from%208%2C000,At%2012%2C000)</u>.

One coach put it: *“As riders approach the 12,000-foot summits... their max sustainable power is about 70-80% of what it is below 5,000 feet”*<u>[trainright.com](https://trainright.com/understanding-challenges-of-high-altitude-racing-at-the-leadville-100-and-usa-pro-cycling-challenge/#:~:text=As%20you%20go%20from%208%2C000,At%2012%2C000)</u>. The impact is huge: climbs that would be moderate at low altitude become leg-breakers at 12k. You simply cannot go as hard – and if you try, you’ll redline quickly and struggle to recover. *“By the time you hit Leadville at 10,000 feet, you’re operating at fifteen percent less power,”* says Dr. Peter Hackett of the Institute for Altitude Medicine<u>[bicycling.com](https://www.bicycling.com/training/g20045947/this-is-your-body-on-altitude/#:~:text=The%20same%20hill%20you%20could,once%20you%20hit%20high%20altitude)</u>. In practical terms, a hill you could sustain 250 W on at home might only allow ~210 W at Leadville – and your heart rate will be higher for that effort.
**Physiological Effects:** At high altitude, **heart rate and breathing rate increase** to compensate for low oxygen. You might see your heart rate 10-15 beats higher for a given pace than normal at 10k ft<u>[bicycling.com](https://www.bicycling.com/training/g20045947/this-is-your-body-on-altitude/#:~:text=Image%3A%20cyclists%20riding%20up%20mountain,passShutterstock)</u>.

Dehydration is also a risk: the dry air causes you to lose fluids faster (and altitude triggers a diuretic effect causing you to pee more the first day or two)<u>[bicycling.com](https://www.bicycling.com/training/g20045947/this-is-your-body-on-altitude/#:~:text=It%E2%80%99s%20not%20your%20imagination,becomes%20more%20concentrated%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20says)</u>. All these factors mean *sea-level athletes cannot expect to perform the same at Leadville without adjusting pace*.
**Altitude Sickness:** Some people suffer acute mountain sickness (AMS) when coming from low elevation. Symptoms include headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, extreme fatigue, and poor sleep. Even super fit racers are not immune – **it’s noted that some Leadville 100 participants have gotten altitude sickness** during the race<u>[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/Mountaineering/comments/1eyf6h3/am_i_susceptible_to_altitude_sickness/#:~:text=Am%20I%20susceptible%20to%20altitude,it%20and%20I%27ve%20seen)</u>.

Pushing too hard early can precipitate AMS or at least a miserable day (“cannot contain my HR… altitude sickness from pushing too [hard]” noted one runner before Leadville<u>[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ultramarathon/comments/1mlpaut/tips_on_keeping_hr_down_at_altitude/#:~:text=Tips%20on%20keeping%20HR%20down,sickness%20from%20pushing%20too)</u>). The organizers themselves emphasize acclimatization because each year “unacclimatized but otherwise fit athletes” DNF or have a *“disappointing experience”* due to the altitude<u>[leadvilleraceseries.com](https://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/acclimatize-for-the-leadville-100-from-home/#:~:text=Altitude%20Training%20at%20Home)</u>. **The bottom line:** if you are not adapted, the altitude *will* bite you.
**Pacing Adjustments:** Nearly everyone from lower elevations finds they must pace more conservatively at Leadville. *“Riding at extremely high altitude requires patience and body awareness. You just don’t recover the way you would at lower elevations,”* writes 4-time winner Rebecca Rusch<u>[leadvilleraceseries.com](https://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/dispatches-from-columbine-top-10-things-to-know-before-your-first-leadville-trail-100-mtb/#:~:text=1,requires%20patience%20and%20body%20awareness)</u>. She advises dialing back your early effort significantly: *“If you start out too fast… you will pay dearly for it on the return trip home. It’s better to start conservatively and finish strong than own the first 20 miles and blow up spectacularly later”*<u>[leadvilleraceseries.com](https://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/dispatches-from-columbine-top-10-things-to-know-before-your-first-leadville-trail-100-mtb/#:~:text=You%20just%20don%E2%80%99t%20recover%20the,the%20air%20is%20that%20thin)</u>. This is echoed by experienced racers – you have to respect the altitude and “race differently when the air is that thin”<u>[leadvilleraceseries.com](https://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/dispatches-from-columbine-top-10-things-to-know-before-your-first-leadville-trail-100-mtb/#:~:text=home,the%20air%20is%20that%20thin)</u>. Heart rate spikes and VO₂ max efforts should be avoided if possible; going into the red at 12,000 ft can take minutes to recover from rather than seconds<u>[trainright.com](https://trainright.com/understanding-challenges-of-high-altitude-racing-at-the-leadville-100-and-usa-pro-cycling-challenge/#:~:text=supermen%20of%20endurance%20sports%2C%20high,altitude%20is%20like%20kryptonite)</u>.

In fact, “sweet spot all day long” is the mantra – stay at a moderately hard, but sustainable, pace especially on climbs<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/leadville-100-mtb-2019/9737?page=2#:~:text=My%20tips%3A)</u>. Many riders use power meters and aim for a lower percentage of threshold than they would in a lower-altitude race. And as Rusch says, *everyone* will slow down – even acclimated locals can’t escape physiology, though they have an edge.
**Acclimation Strategies:** To combat altitude, there are two main approaches: **arrive as early as possible** (days or weeks prior to acclimate naturally), or **arrive at the last minute** (so you start before altitude sickness kicks in fully). The gold standard is to **acclimate for 2-3 weeks** at high elevation if you can<u>[trainright.com](https://trainright.com/understanding-challenges-of-high-altitude-racing-at-the-leadville-100-and-usa-pro-cycling-challenge/#:~:text=,cardiovascular%20benefits%20of%20acclimating%20to)</u>. Full physiological adaptation (increase in red blood cells, etc.) takes about 3 weeks<u>[trainright.com](https://trainright.com/understanding-challenges-of-high-altitude-racing-at-the-leadville-100-and-usa-pro-cycling-challenge/#:~:text=,cardiovascular%20benefits%20of%20acclimating%20to)</u>. Many serious racers **arrive 10–14 days (or more) before** Leadville to train and acclimate in Colorado. For example, one Reddit user shared: *“I drove to Colorado Springs and stayed there for 2 wks at 7,600 ft. Then I stayed in Dillon (9,100 ft) the week before Leadville… I did almost no hard training in CO, just plenty of Zone2 and good sleep and fueling… when Leadville came, I felt the best I’ve ever felt in a race (went sub-9)”*<u>[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/xcmtb/comments/1faphhr/training_for_leadville_100/#:~:text=I%20just%20did%20my%20first,ever%20felt%20in%20a%20race)</u>. Numerous veterans echo this: *“I actually come out two weeks before each race… The race is great, but those two weeks in town are one of the most exciting parts”*<u>[leadvilleraceseries.com](https://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/dispatches-from-10000-feet-altitude-adjustment/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CI%E2%80%99ve%20completed%20six%20Leadville%20Trail,%E2%80%9D%C2%A0%E2%80%93%20Martin%20Morud%2C%20WI)</u>. Another said: *“I arrive 16 days before the race… The first 5 days are very hard (asthma sufferer), lots of water and low intensity. By day ~6 I start to feel better”*<u>[leadvilleraceseries.com](https://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/dispatches-from-10000-feet-altitude-adjustment/#:~:text=the%20people%20of%20Leadville%2C%20Colorado,Martin%20Morud%2C%20WI)</u>. If two weeks isn’t possible, **even a week is helpful** – e.g. *“I arrive eight days before… I usually have a headache and rapid breathing for a couple days. I do short easy rides, drink tons of water, eat well. Each day I feel a little better”*<u>[leadvilleraceseries.com](https://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/dispatches-from-10000-feet-altitude-adjustment/#:~:text=make%20a%20difference,AZ)</u>.
If you **can’t come early**, some advise the opposite: arrive just before the race (within 24 hours of the start) so that you race before your body fully realizes the altitude stress. There’s a common saying: either “arrive the day-of or after two weeks.” The middle window (1-4 days after arriving) can be the worst for altitude sickness. A TrainerRoad forum user noted, “the perception is to stay longer (1-2 weeks) or arrive the day of/day before” to avoid the in-between phase<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/adjusting-ftp-lthr-for-training-racing-at-altitude/56676#:~:text=That%20might%20be%20less%20than,and%20calculate%20with%20some%20caution)</u>. Another athlete reported: *“I know that gets said, but personally I’m much better off 3-4 days in. Coming up the morning of would be a hard no for me”*<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/adjusting-ftp-lthr-for-training-racing-at-altitude/56676#:~:text=Image%20Rizzi%3A)</u> – showing that this can vary by individual. If you do arrive just 1-2 days before, accept that you’ll be at an even greater power deficit (no acclimation at all) and pace extremely cautiously those first climbs.
**Altitude Training Aids:** Because not everyone can spend weeks in the Rockies, many racers use altitude simulation. High-end options include sleeping in an **altitude tent** or using a hypoxic generator to pre-acclimate at home. The Leadville Race Series partners with Hypoxico, which offers an 8-week altitude tent rental package (around $1,200) targeted at Leadville racers<u>[leadvilleraceseries.com](https://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/acclimatize-for-the-leadville-100-from-home/#:~:text=Special%20Rental%20Package%20for%20LT100,Ride%20and%20Run)</u>. They claim you can “simulate Hope Pass and the Columbine climb from the comfort of home”<u>[leadvilleraceseries.com](https://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/acclimatize-for-the-leadville-100-from-home/#:~:text=while%20we%E2%80%99d%20all%20love%20to,from%20the%20comforts%20of%20home)</u>. Essentially, you sleep (and optionally do some training sessions) in low-oxygen conditions to trigger your body’s acclimation responses (more red blood cells, capillaries, etc.)<u>[leadvilleraceseries.com](https://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/acclimatize-for-the-leadville-100-from-home/#:~:text=In%20addition%20to%20acclimatization%2C%20the,benefits%20of%20altitude%20training%20include)</u><u>[leadvilleraceseries.com](https://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/acclimatize-for-the-leadville-100-from-home/#:~:text=For%20years%20now%2C%20our%20phones,must%20prepare%20for%20the%20altitude)</u>. This can help offset that 30% oxygen deficit. However, altitude tents require discipline and time – typically using them for several hours a day, weeks in advance. Whether via tent or travel, the message from coaches is clear: **“If you want to have your best day…you must prepare for the altitude. Don’t let altitude be the reason you DNF.”**<u>[leadvilleraceseries.com](https://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/acclimatize-for-the-leadville-100-from-home/#:~:text=For%20years%20now%2C%20our%20phones,must%20prepare%20for%20the%20altitude)</u>.
**Hydration and Nutrition at Altitude:** The dry air of Leadville can dehydrate you quickly through sweat evaporation and heavy breathing. The air is generally low humidity, and as mentioned, altitude diuresis will make you lose fluid. *“Drink an obscene amount of water every day in the days leading up…and while in Leadville,”* advises one experienced racer<u>[leadvilleraceseries.com](https://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/dispatches-from-10000-feet-altitude-adjustment/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CI%20arrive%20eight%20days%20before,%E2%80%9D%C2%A0%E2%80%93%20Kevin%20Spinelli%2C%20CA)</u>. Many athletes increase electrolyte intake as well (since altitude can alter your thirst and fluid balance). On nutrition, some evidence suggests **high-carbohydrate fuel is even more crucial at altitude** – carbs yield more energy per oxygen unit than fats<u>[leadvilleraceseries.com](https://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/dispatches-from-10000-feet-altitude-adjustment/#:~:text=during%20the%20race%2C%20and%20the,%E2%80%9D%C2%A0%E2%80%93%20Todd%20Geer%2C%20Nebraska)</u><u>[bicycling.com](https://www.bicycling.com/training/g20045947/this-is-your-body-on-altitude/#:~:text=Image%3A%20girl%20not%20hungryShutterstock)</u>. Thus, hitting your carb targets (90+ grams per hour, if tolerated) can partly mitigate the performance drop. Pro tip: **Beet juice or nitrates.** Some studies show nitrate supplementation (beetroot juice) helps at altitude by improving blood flow. Dr. Hackett recommended it for high-altitude functioning<u>[bicycling.com](https://www.bicycling.com/training/g20045947/this-is-your-body-on-altitude/#:~:text=dilate%20your%20blood%20vessels%20to,function%20in%20low%20oxygen%20environments)</u>. Indeed, a Leadville blogger mentioned using beet juice “to allow your body to process oxygen more efficiently… highly recommended”<u>[alphaarchitect.com](https://alphaarchitect.com/how-to-survive-the-leadville-100-trail-run/#:~:text=have%20a%20heart%20attack%29)</u>. So, many racers “prime” with beet juice shots leading up to race day.
**Mental Aspect:** Altitude can mess with your mind as much as your body. The lack of oxygen can create anxiety or panic sensations when you’re deep in the pain cave (“air hunger” is real). Staying calm and **managing effort is key**. As Rebecca Rusch says, everyone will struggle up there – even the acclimated. Accepting that and not freaking out is important. Many racers use mantras or mental tricks when they “hit the wall” at altitude. One mid-pack finisher said, *“I told myself, one step at a time – we’re almost to the top!”* to keep moving during the Columbine slog<u>[joinbasecamp.com](https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/shawns-story-leadville-100?srsltid=AfmBOoryXL74ixQ1OBO_3wvLuo7lEru7_mjJPuWTPHhnyUQfRHiriRnT#:~:text=Columbine%20was%20a%20kick%20in,WE%27RE%20ALMOST%20TO%20THE%20TOP)</u><u>[joinbasecamp.com](https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/shawns-story-leadville-100?srsltid=AfmBOoryXL74ixQ1OBO_3wvLuo7lEru7_mjJPuWTPHhnyUQfRHiriRnT#:~:text=jeep%20trail%20with%20a%20deep,WE%27RE%20ALMOST%20TO%20THE%20TOP)</u>. Another said his mantra was *“The hay is in the barn”* (meaning: the work is done, now just execute) to calm pre-race nerves and during dark moments<u>[joinbasecamp.com](https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/shawns-story-leadville-100?srsltid=AfmBOoryXL74ixQ1OBO_3wvLuo7lEru7_mjJPuWTPHhnyUQfRHiriRnT#:~:text=I%20had%20a%20chat%20with,Thanks%2C%20Kaci%20Wall)</u>. Expect some low points; nearly everyone has a moment where the altitude makes them want to quit. But those who endure say it’s worth it at the finish.
In summary, **altitude is the great equalizer** at Leadville. Sea-level mortals simply can’t replicate the feeling until they’re there: the shortness of breath just going up a mild hill, the way your heart thumps climbing even in your easiest gear, the way a hard surge can leave you dizzy and gasping. But with smart acclimation (or at least a sensible pacing strategy if arriving late), proper hydration/nutrition, and respect for the environment, you can survive it. Many racers actually find the thin, dry air causes *different* issues too – e.g., you might get **sunburned faster** (strong UV at 10k ft), or **chapped lips** and **dry lungs** (some wear a buff over mouth early morning to humidify the air). Little things, but all part of the Leadville experience. As they say in Colorado: *“Train low, live high”* if you can – but if you can’t, at least *“arrive high, don’t go out too fast, drink your water, and embrace the suck.”*
## **CUTOFF TIMES (STATION BY STATION)**
The Leadville 100 MTB imposes strict **cut-off times** at several aid stations to ensure riders finish by the 12-hour limit. Missing a cutoff means an automatic DNF (you’ll be pulled from the course). All cutoff times are based on **gun time (6:30am start)**, not your chip time<u>[leadvilleraceseries.com](https://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024_EVCO-LRS_100MTB_AthleteGuide.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Salty%20Snacks%20%E2%80%A2%20Chip,be%20sure%20to%20thank%20them)</u>.
Here are the **official cutoffs for each key point** (from the Athlete Guide)<u>[leadvilleraceseries.com](https://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024_EVCO-LRS_100MTB_AthleteGuide.pdf#:~:text=Aid%20Station%20Supplies%20CUT,8%20Miles%20Inbound%20Cutoff%20Time)</u><u>[leadvilleraceseries.com](https://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024_EVCO-LRS_100MTB_AthleteGuide.pdf#:~:text=1%20Carter%20Summit%20,52%20Miles%20Turnaround%20%E2%80%A2%20Water)</u>:
* **Twin Lakes Dam – Outbound (mile 40.8):** **10:50 am** outbound cutoff<u>[leadvilleraceseries.com](https://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024_EVCO-LRS_100MTB_AthleteGuide.pdf#:~:text=1%20Carter%20Summit%20,52%20Miles)</u>. Riders must **leave** Twin Lakes by 10:50. This is roughly 4h20m after the start. If you haven’t hit Twin Lakes (outbound) by then, you’ll be pulled. (Note: In 2022 they adjusted cutoffs so even the last corral gets a full 12 hours<u>[leadvilleraceseries.com](https://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024_EVCO-LRS_100MTB_AthleteGuide.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Cutoff%20times%20have%20been,are%20based%20on%20chip%20time)</u>. That 10:50 time may account for the last wave starting ~6:42am.)
* **Columbine Turnaround (mile 52):** *No explicit cutoff given.* However, to make the Twin Lakes *inbound* cutoff (2:35 pm), riders typically need to summit Columbine by ~1:15–1:30 pm at the latest. The top of Columbine is more a timing mat than a checkpoint – you must simply turn and descend. (Historically, sometimes a soft cutoff was enforced around ~1:30 pm at the summit to clear the mountain of outbound riders before too many inbound riders come down.)
* **Twin Lakes Dam – Inbound (mile 63.2):** **2:35 pm** inbound cutoff<u>[leadvilleraceseries.com](https://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024_EVCO-LRS_100MTB_AthleteGuide.pdf#:~:text=Aid%20Station%20Supplies%20CUT,8%20Miles%20Inbound%20Cutoff%20Time)</u>. This is arguably the most important time check. Failing to get back to Twin Lakes by 2:35 (8h05m race time) means you won’t likely finish in 12h. At 2:35 pm they close the course here.
* **Outward Bound (Pipeline) – Inbound (mile 78.5):** **4:00 pm** inbound cutoff<u>[leadvilleraceseries.com](https://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024_EVCO-LRS_100MTB_AthleteGuide.pdf#:~:text=Inbound%20Cutoff%20Time%202%3A35pm%205,10.5%20Miles)</u>. This station (Pipeline returning) closes at 4:00 pm (9h30m race time). If you depart after 4:00 pm, officials will stop you. This cutoff forces riders to start the Powerline climb by ~4:00.
* **Carter Summit – Inbound (mile 92.8):** **6:20 pm** inbound cutoff<u>[leadvilleraceseries.com](https://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024_EVCO-LRS_100MTB_AthleteGuide.pdf#:~:text=4%3A00pm%205%20Carter%20Summit%20,Miles%20Outbound%20Cutoff%20Time%2010%3A50am)</u>. This is on the Turquoise Lake Road (Carter Summit) aid, ~11.5 hours into the race. It’s essentially the last cut – if you’re here by 6:20, you have ~10km (7-8 miles) to go mostly downhill; 6:20 was calculated to allow finishing by 12h. They will pull riders at or before this time.
* **Finish Line (mile ~104):** **12 hours (6:30 pm)** for the final official finish<u>[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadville_Trail_100_MTB#:~:text=Riders%20must%20check%20out%20of,small%20buckle)</u>. Riders must **finish** by 6:30:00 pm gun time to be an official finisher and receive the small buckle. Again, because chip times are used for buckle qualification, a rider who started in a later wave might cross after 6:30 but still under 12:00:00 net time and get a buckle<u>[leadvilleraceseries.com](https://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024_EVCO-LRS_100MTB_AthleteGuide.pdf#:~:text=9,RACE%20AWARDS)</u>. Practically, the finish line stays “soft open” until about 6:40-6:50 to catch those last chip-timing-adjusted finishes<u>[leadvilleraceseries.com](https://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024_EVCO-LRS_100MTB_AthleteGuide.pdf#:~:text=9,RACE%20AWARDS)</u>. But by 7:00 pm, the race is done and course closed.
* **9-hour cut-off (large buckle threshold):** Riders finishing **under 9:00:00** (chip time) earn the big buckle<u>[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadville_Trail_100_MTB#:~:text=Riders%20must%20check%20out%20of,small%20buckle)</u>. There isn’t a checkpoint for this, just the finish. However, for tradition, the race often fires a shotgun at **3:30 pm** (9h mark) to note the big buckle cut-off window<u>[leadvilleraceseries.com](https://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024_EVCO-LRS_100MTB_AthleteGuide.pdf#:~:text=9,RACE%20AWARDS)</u>. Unofficially, those finishing between 9:00 and 9:30 might still get a big buckle if they were delayed in a later wave (the rules say chip time for buckles<u>[leadvilleraceseries.com](https://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024_EVCO-LRS_100MTB_AthleteGuide.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Cutoff%20times%20have%20been,are%20based%20on%20chip%20time)</u>, so it’s based on your personal 9h). But by 9:00–9:15 gun time, usually that’s it for big buckles. In recent results, only a small fraction of the field breaks 9h (e.g. ~100–200 riders).
All these times are published each year in the Athlete Guide and are *enforced by course marshals*. For example, the 2024 guide notes: *“Cutoff times have been adjusted from 2021 to ensure all corrals have 12 hours to complete the race. All belt buckle times are based on chip time. All course cutoffs are based on gun time.”*<u>[leadvilleraceseries.com](https://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024_EVCO-LRS_100MTB_AthleteGuide.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Cutoff%20times%20have%20been,are%20based%20on%20chip%20time)</u><u>[leadvilleraceseries.com](https://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024_EVCO-LRS_100MTB_AthleteGuide.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Salty%20Snacks%20%E2%80%A2%20Chip,be%20sure%20to%20thank%20them)</u>. If a rider misses a cutoff, they’ll be pulled (usually kindly) and given transport back to town. On course, you may hear volunteers calling out “X minutes to cutoff!” as deadlines approach, spurring desperate efforts.
**Buckle Stats:** The **big buckle (sub-9h)** and **small buckle (sub-12h)** are huge motivators. Traditionally, perhaps ~10% of racers get big buckles, and the majority get small buckles. For example, in 2023, Keegan Swenson set a new course record in **5h43m** (!)<u>[pinkbike.com](https://www.pinkbike.com/news/results-leadville-trail-100-mtb-race.html#:~:text=riders%20competed%20in%20Leadville%20for,Check%20out%20the%20results%20below)</u><u>[pinkbike.com](https://www.pinkbike.com/news/results-leadville-trail-100-mtb-race.html#:~:text=)</u>. Only 8 men went under 7 hours; roughly 100 or so broke 9 hours out of ~1750 starters (just an estimate). Meanwhile, that year ~1538 finished under 12h out of 1561 starters (98.5% – an unusually high finisher rate, likely due to good weather and the fact that many who qualify are well-prepared)<u>[trainright.com](https://trainright.com/leadville-100-problem-women-representation/#:~:text=Working%20an%20aid%20station%20at,and%20that%E2%80%99s%20a%20problem)</u>. In some tougher years (bad weather, etc.), the finish rate is lower but still usually >80-90%.
The **cutoff pressures** really manifest at Twin Lakes inbound and on Powerline. Often there’s a dramatic scene as the 2:35pm Twin Lakes cutoff nears – riders sprinting to make it, or collapsing just short as the clock passes. The 12-hour finish line cutoff is similarly dramatic. The organizers bring out a shotgun or pistol and fire it right at 12:00:00 (6:30 pm) as the final bell. Any rider not across the line by then is *not* an official finisher (though they still get a time). In Leadville lore, there are heartbreaking stories of someone missing the buckle by seconds – and euphoric ones of a rider who dug deep and *just* made 11:59:59. It’s all part of what makes Leadville’s cutoff culture unique. As Ken Chlouber famously says, *“You’re better than you think you are. You can do more than you think you can.”* The cutoffs challenge you to prove it.
## **WEATHER HISTORY (AUGUST AT ALTITUDE)**
**Expect the unexpected.** Leadville’s weather in August is generally mild but highly variable, especially up high.
Typical climate data for Leadville in August: **average highs around 65–70 °F (18–21 °C) and average lows around 38–42 °F (3–6 °C)**<u>[wanderlog.com](https://wanderlog.com/weather/58836/8/leadville-weather-in-august#:~:text=climate%20wanderlog,5%C2%B0C)</u>. Humidity is low (often ~50% or less)<u>[timeanddate.com](https://www.timeanddate.com/weather/@7174247/climate#:~:text=August%20Climate%20%26%20Weather%20Averages,Dew%20Point%3A%2037)</u>, and precipitation averages ~1.7 inches for the month, mostly from brief summer thunderstorms<u>[usclimatedata.com](https://www.usclimatedata.com/climate/leadville/colorado/united-states/usco0235#:~:text=Colorado%20and%20Weather%20averages%20Leadville,75%2C%2023)</u>. Mornings are usually chilly – near 40 °F at the 6:30am start, sometimes even upper 30s if it’s clear overnight. By afternoon, temps in town may reach upper 60s °F, but on course it feels warmer in the sun.
**Sun & UV:** At 10,000+ ft elevation, the sun’s UV intensity is strong. A sunny day can feel hot even if the thermometer reads 65 °F. Many riders get sunburned if not careful (sunblock is advised on neck/ears). The thin air offers little haze, so UV radiation is higher than at low altitude.
**Typical Day:** Often race morning dawns cold and clear (frost on the grass isn’t unheard of). As the sun rises, temperature climbs quickly into the 50s. The first couple hours can be quite cold on descents – many wear a light jacket or arm warmers at least until mid-morning. By noon, it can be pleasantly warm (60s) at lower elevations. However, high points like Columbine (~12,5k ft) stay cooler and very windy.
**Afternoon Thunderstorms:** The Rocky Mountains are notorious for almost daily summer afternoon storms. In August, it’s common to have **sunny mornings followed by early-afternoon clouds and some showers**. Leadville’s guide warns: *“Weather in the Colorado high country is notorious for rapid and violent changes. During the race it* ***could rain, hail, or even snow****.”*<u>[leadvilleraceseries.com](https://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Leadville-Athlete-Guide-100-RUN-Read-Only.pdf#:~:text=,rain%2C%20hail%20and%20even%20snow)</u>. Indeed, there have been races with every type of weather. A **famous example is 2009**: that year, a mid-day storm at the Columbine summit pummeled riders with freezing rain and sleet<u>[leadvilleraceseries.com](https://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/dispatches-from-columbine-top-10-things-to-know-before-your-first-leadville-trail-100-mtb/#:~:text=Weather%20often%20turns%20on%20a,will%20or%20will%20not%20bring)</u>. Many were caught in short-sleeves at 12,000 ft when the squall hit – hypothermia became a real danger. *“If anyone watched the 2009 Race Across the Sky [documentary], you saw freezing rain and snow hit scantily clad riders on top of Columbine. Many riders couldn’t descend because their hands were too frozen to brake,”* recounts Rebecca Rusch<u>[leadvilleraceseries.com](https://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/dispatches-from-columbine-top-10-things-to-know-before-your-first-leadville-trail-100-mtb/#:~:text=Weather%20often%20turns%20on%20a,will%20or%20will%20not%20bring)</u>. She had wisely packed a light rain jacket and shell gloves that year and said those “made all the difference”<u>[leadvilleraceseries.com](https://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/dispatches-from-columbine-top-10-things-to-know-before-your-first-leadville-trail-100-mtb/#:~:text=scantily%20clad%20riders%20on%20top,will%20or%20will%20not%20bring)</u>. That lesson is clear: even if the forecast is dry, **pack some emergency layers** in your drop bag or with your crew, especially for Columbine. Mountain weather can change in 10 minutes.
Conversely, there have been years with *zero* rain and even some heat. 2012, for instance, was sunny and quite warm (well into the 70s F). In those conditions, the high sun and altitude can dehydrate riders quickly and even cause heat stress (it sounds odd at 10k ft, but under a cloudless sky, 70 °F feels hot).
**Wind:** Wind can be a factor. Often morning is calm, but by afternoon a brisk west wind can pick up. On the return leg (heading west/northwest from Columbine back to Leadville), riders sometimes face a headwind, especially on the Pipeline-to-Powerline flat section. In 2022-2023, for example, there were reports of significant wind in the afternoon. One report mentions “an 18–22 mph sidewind” on the flat stretch to Powerline inbound<u>[joinbasecamp.com](https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/shawns-story-leadville-100?srsltid=AfmBOoryXL74ixQ1OBO_3wvLuo7lEru7_mjJPuWTPHhnyUQfRHiriRnT#:~:text=They%20took%20great%20care%20of,line%20was%20no%20good%20to)</u>. Riders tried to form echelons to combat it. So, **wind and headwinds** can add to the difficulty, making the flats not so flat-feeling. Paceline with others when possible to save energy if a headwind kicks up.
**Precipitation Types:** Rain is most common, but hail is not rare in mountain thunderstorms. Tiny hail or graupel can fall even on a warm day. Snow is unlikely in August below 12,000 ft, but as 2009 showed, a brief snow or sleet squall can occur up high. If a major front comes through, temperatures could drop sharply. One should watch the forecast in race week closely. Leadville is above 10k ft – even in mid-summer, a freak cold front could bring an overnight dusting on the peaks.
**Weather Prep:** All racers are advised to **bring clothing for all conditions**. Typically, you might start with a light jacket or vest and full-finger gloves at 6:30am, then shed layers by Twin Lakes when it’s warmer. But you should have those layers available again for the Columbine descent or if rain comes. A common strategy: stash a cheap rain jacket in your Twin Lakes crew bag, so you can carry it up Columbine “just in case.” If the day stays fair, you won’t use it; but if a storm brews, you’ll be extremely thankful. Rebecca Rusch’s story of riders unable to brake due to cold hands is sobering – now many pack thin rain gloves or even latex gloves (windproof) for the Columbine descent in bad weather.
**Historical Weather Highlights:**
* *2008:* Cold rain in the afternoon, reportedly making Powerline a slippery mess.
* *2009:* The infamous cold storm at Columbine (Armstrong vs. Wiens battle year). Despite midday temps near 70 in town, it snowed/sleeted on Columbine for a short period<u>[leadvilleraceseries.com](https://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/dispatches-from-columbine-top-10-things-to-know-before-your-first-leadville-trail-100-mtb/#:~:text=Weather%20often%20turns%20on%20a,will%20or%20will%20not%20bring)</u>. Many riders suffered hypothermia.
* *2010:* Generally nice weather, mild.
* *2015:* There was a brief thunderstorm that caused some hail on parts of the course, IIRC (need source, but several personal blogs mention a storm around 2-3pm).
* *2017:* Hail storm in late afternoon hit some of the back-of-pack riders.
* *2019:* Fairly ideal – cool morning (~39°F start), then sunny and calm, high ~70°F.
* *2021:* Warm and sunny (mid-70s), but an afternoon shower with lightning caused some concern (they did not stop the race, but advised caution).
* *2022:* Quite warm (80°F in town) and dry; strong winds midday. Dust was an issue on Powerline due to dryness.
* *2023:* Started cold (frost present) but turned into a mix of sun and a brief rain. Keegan Swenson noted “some wind and a little bit of rain, but the course was fast and tacky”<u>[pinkbike.com](https://www.pinkbike.com/news/results-leadville-trail-100-mtb-race.html#:~:text=Image%3A%20bigquotesI%20was%20so%20short,%E2%80%94Keegan%C2%A0Swenson)</u>. Generally a fast year due to good conditions.
**Summary:** In August, **mornings ~40°F, afternoons ~70°F** are typical in Leadville. But the saying “if you don’t like the weather, wait 5 minutes” applies. **Be prepared for sun, wind, rain, or hail.** Bring layers: arm warmers, a vest or light jacket, waterproof shell, gloves for cold, maybe even a buff/ear cover for the morning. Hypothermia is a real threat if you get caught in cold rain while exhausted at 12k ft. Conversely, sunscreen, lip balm, and plenty of fluids are needed for the high-altitude sun and dryness. Many riders overdress at the start (because it’s freezing at 6am) and then overheat later – it’s a tricky balance. Dressing in layers you can peel off is key.
Finally, note that **weather can affect cutoffs and finishing rates**. In a year with severe weather, the DNF rate will spike as people drop out or miss cutoffs due to slow going. But on a perfect bluebird day, expect faster times and more finishers. Part of Leadville’s challenge is that you need to be ready for anything from **30°F sleet to 75°F blazing sun** – sometimes all in the same race.
## **REDDIT THREADS**
The Leadville Trail 100 is a hot topic on cycling forums like Reddit, where racers and aspirants swap advice and war stories. Here are some insights and quotes crowdsourced from **Reddit threads** in subreddits like r/MTB, r/cycling, r/Velo, and r/ultrarunning:
* **On the Columbine Climb:** One Redditor gave a vivid description of Columbine’s severity: *“Columbine takes you from an elevation of 9.5k feet to 12.5k feet over 7 miles of what starts out as fire roads and ends as rocky, narrow,* ***STEEP*** *single track”*<u>[shop.sportsbasement.com](https://shop.sportsbasement.com/blogs/news/matt-takes-on-the-leadville-100-video-4?srsltid=AfmBOooxTnsubJh8ikxGkIY_xyHdGCVUEvsJyviT0m6DfYKJy9kKsxTe#:~:text=Things%20came%20apart%20when%20I,feet%20above%20sea%20level%2C%20a)</u>. In a thread on r/MTB, users emphasized how much of Columbine usually becomes a hike: *“By the time I was descending Columbine, the uphill traffic was 3-5 deep, all walking”* (a comment highlighting the conga line effect)<u>[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/COBike/comments/1owekfa/hardtail_or_full_suspension_for_frontage_and/#:~:text=Reddit%20www,5)</u>. Another quipped that Columbine “feels like **a kick in the face**” – starting manageable and ending in thin-air agony. The consensus is that **nobody escapes Columbine easily**: *“I tried my hardest to ride the steep top… I wish I could have been that fast [as the pros descending], but ended up hiking like everyone else”*<u>[elevationoutdoors.com](https://www.elevationoutdoors.com/blogs/alpine-adventures/leadville-100-race-report/#:~:text=Leadville%20100%20Race%20Report%20,ride%20the%20steep%20top)</u>. In short: Reddit advice for Columbine is **pace yourself, and don’t be ashamed to walk** because almost everyone will at some point. And *enjoy the view if you can:* multiple users mention the surreal sight of “**the never-ending line of riders**” snaking up and down the mountain against a beautiful alpine backdrop<u>[altovelo.org](https://www.altovelo.org/race-reports/race-report-2024-leadville-trail-100-mtb#:~:text=The%20climb%20was%20brutally%20long%2C,my%20legs%20were%20cramping%2C%20and)</u><u>[altovelo.org](https://www.altovelo.org/race-reports/race-report-2024-leadville-trail-100-mtb#:~:text=far%20behind,their%20sponsored%20gels%2C%20chugged%20half)</u> – an image unique to Leadville.
* **On Altitude Sickness:** In r/ultrarunning and r/Velo discussions, folks warn that **altitude can humble anyone**. One thread had a user ask if going from 500 ft to 10,000 ft was safe; responses noted that plenty of people do Leadville each year coming from sea level, but some **do** get sick. A Colorado resident on r/14ers wrote: *“Even if you’re super fit, you might get altitude sickness. I know Leadville 100 racers who got it”*<u>[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/Mountaineering/comments/1eyf6h3/am_i_susceptible_to_altitude_sickness/#:~:text=Am%20I%20susceptible%20to%20altitude,it%20and%20I%27ve%20seen)</u>. The general Reddit consensus: *Acclimate if you can, and if not, start extra slow.* People share stories like, *“I returned to the mountains and got altitude sickness…learned my lesson”*<u>[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/ultrarunning/comments/er4okj/got_in_to_leadville_100_run/#:~:text=Got%20in%20to%20Leadville%20100,When%20I%20was%20a)</u>. There’s also debate on using altitude tents – one r/Ultramarathon thread had users discussing if a tent was “worth it” for Leadville<u>[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ultramarathon/comments/16b5sll/would_an_altitude_tent_be_worth_it/#:~:text=Would%20an%20altitude%20tent%20be,runs%20with%20the%20mask)</u> (mixed opinions, as some felt it helped while others said just arrive a week early if possible).
* **The Sub-9 Hour Quest:** Many Reddit threads (particularly in r/xcmtb and r/MTB) revolve around how to break 9 hours for the big buckle. Users who achieved it shared tips. One wrote: *“Leadville, for me, is all about pacing and fueling. Find a power you can hold and stay on top of fueling. I went sub-9. I even took a wrong turn and still did 8:32 – hopefully next year I can hit sub-8”*<u>[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/xcmtb/comments/1faphhr/training_for_leadville_100/#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20%201y%20ago)</u><u>[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/xcmtb/comments/1faphhr/training_for_leadville_100/#:~:text=Leadville%2C%20for%20me%20is%20all,I%20can%20hit%20sub%208)</u>. Others emphasize **training volume**: lots of long rides, doing the Silver Rush 50 or Stage Race as practice<u>[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/xcmtb/comments/1faphhr/training_for_leadville_100/#:~:text=Training%3A%20If%20you%20load%20yourself,climbs%20until%20legs%20are%20cooked)</u>. Altitude acclimation is often cited as the secret sauce: *“I blame my sub9 on my coach’s altitude acclimation plan”* said one first-timer who did a 2-week staging at 7600ft before the race<u>[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/xcmtb/comments/1faphhr/training_for_leadville_100/#:~:text=I%20just%20did%20my%20first,ever%20felt%20in%20a%20race)</u>. Another sub-9 finisher advised using the qualifier races for corral placement: *“If you want to go Sub 9, shoot for Green or better. Red is ideal… I did a qualifier to get in a faster corral”*<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/leadville-100-mtb-2019/9737?page=2#:~:text=I%20also%20recommend%20doing%20a,through%20the%20lottery%20to%20both)</u>. The **corral system** is a common Reddit topic – people discuss how prior finish times or qualifier times determine your starting wave, and how that affects your day (less traffic if you start ahead). There was a thread dissecting watts/kg needed for certain times; one user shared a chart (roughly, ~3.0 W/kg for 12h, ~4.0 W/kg for 9h, ~5+ W/kg for the podium, adjusting for altitude)<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/leadville-100-mtb-2019/9737?page=2#:~:text=This%20post%20has%20some%20estimates,this%20based%20on%20your%20FTP)</u>. The overarching Reddit wisdom: Sub-9 requires **serious fitness, good race strategy, and some luck with weather/mechanicals**. It’s not something you can “cruise” into; it often takes multiple attempts.
* **Powerline Descent & Powerline Climb:** The Powerline descent early in the race is often a hot topic for first-timers seeking advice. Redditors caution that **it’s sketchy**: very bumpy and easy to flat or crash if you choose a bad line. *“Stay loose, pick smart lines, and don’t be afraid to dismount if someone in front of you stalls,”* one user suggested. Another mentioned: *“I lost a bottle on Powerline even with a decent cage – be aware it’s rough”*<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/leadville-100-mtb-2019/9737?page=9#:~:text=%40Jonathan%20try%20and%20pull%20that,off%E2%80%A6)</u>. As for **Powerline inbound (climb)**, Reddit threads sometimes devolve into gallows humor: *“Powerline will make you find religion”*, *“I was seeing ghosts on that climb”*, etc. One user on r/MTB said: *“The ‘Powerline Plod’ – get ready to hike with cramps in muscles you didn’t know you had”*. In r/xcmtb, a coach commented, *“Powerline is hard being so late in the race. I’d recommend to pre-ride Columbine and Powerline if you can. Mentally knowing those climbs helps”*<u>[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/xcmtb/comments/1faphhr/training_for_leadville_100/#:~:text=tough,so%20late%20in%20the%20race)</u>. A Reddit recap from a 2021 racer stated bluntly: *“Every step [on Powerline] was hard, rocks slipping under my feet, the energy around me feeling like death…a total blow to the soul”*<u>[joinbasecamp.com](https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/shawns-story-leadville-100?srsltid=AfmBOoryXL74ixQ1OBO_3wvLuo7lEru7_mjJPuWTPHhnyUQfRHiriRnT#:~:text=They%20say%20the%20race%20truly,total%20blow%20to%20the%20soul)</u><u>[joinbasecamp.com](https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/shawns-story-leadville-100?srsltid=AfmBOoryXL74ixQ1OBO_3wvLuo7lEru7_mjJPuWTPHhnyUQfRHiriRnT#:~:text=mountain,total%20blow%20to%20the%20soul)</u>. In summary: **Reddit’s take on Powerline** – accept that you’ll likely walk, it will hurt a lot, but it’s the last monster you must slay.
* **Mental and Emotional Highs/Lows:** The r/ultrarunning and r/MTB communities often talk about the *mental* side of Leadville. Common advice includes breaking the race into segments (aid station to aid station) so it’s psychologically manageable. People quote the founders: *“You’re better than you think you are…”* etc., as cheesy but true motivation. One Redditor said the single best moment was cresting Columbine and realizing you’re headed home: *“It’s all literally downhill from here!”* (not entirely true, but it feels like it). Another memorable Reddit quote: *“Leadville 100 will try to take your soul – but if you hang on, the finish is worth it”*<u>[joinbasecamp.com](https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/shawns-story-leadville-100?srsltid=AfmBOoryXL74ixQ1OBO_3wvLuo7lEru7_mjJPuWTPHhnyUQfRHiriRnT#:~:text=jumping%20up%20and%20down%2C%20my,Welcome)</u>. This came from a finisher describing how utterly spent he was (he shook uncontrollably for an hour after finishing)<u>[joinbasecamp.com](https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/shawns-story-leadville-100?srsltid=AfmBOoryXL74ixQ1OBO_3wvLuo7lEru7_mjJPuWTPHhnyUQfRHiriRnT#:~:text=jumping%20up%20and%20down%2C%20my,Welcome)</u>, yet by the next morning the pain was forgotten and the pride set in.
* **Gear and Bike Debates:** Reddit gearheads love to argue about the best bike for Leadville. r/MTB and r/cycling have multiple threads like “Hardtail or Full Suspension for Leadville?”, “Is Leadville a gravel race now?” etc. A frequently cited stat: *“The course is on dirt roads, pavement, and two-track. There are less than 2 miles of singletrack in the entire 104 mile race,”* one user posted<u>[facebook.com](https://www.facebook.com/CyclingWeekly/posts/has-leadville-100-become-a-gravel-racewhy-are-pros-racing-the-biggest-mtb-race-i/1170534518437150/#:~:text=Has%20Leadville%20100%20become%20a,the%20entire%20104%20mile%20race)</u>. That often leads to people suggesting hardtails or even gravel bikes with suspension forks. Some Redditors who attempted drop-bar setups shared their experiences (mostly positive if they were skilled, but a few said the lack of MTB handling on rough parts cost them time). As one user put it, *“Leadville will be the easiest 100-miler you’ve done, technically – by far the easiest of the hundies I’ve done”*<u>[mtbr.com](https://www.mtbr.com/threads/leadville-100-advice.1012567/#:~:text=Leadville%20100%20Advice%20,hundies%20that%20I%20have%20done)</u> – but they emphasize *physically* it’s still brutal. That comment sparked discussions that a lightweight XC bike is ideal; “down-country” bikes with 100mm travel, maybe a dropper seatpost (some say dropper not needed, others like it for Powerline descent). In the **TrainerRoad forum**, CEO Nate Pearson noted seeing many riders with suboptimal gear: *“I saw so many slow tires, loose jerseys flapping, squeaky chains, and non-aero helmets. People are probably losing 20-40 watts on bad setup”*<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/leadville-100-mtb-2019/9737?page=2#:~:text=1,done%20more%20of%20this%20earlier)</u><u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/leadville-100-mtb-2019/9737?page=2#:~:text=2,how%20bad%20their%20setup%20is)</u>. Reddit threads similarly advise: use fast-rolling tires, wear a snug jersey, and don’t carry unnecessary weight. Every watt counts over 100 miles at altitude.
In conclusion, Reddit threads function as a collective veteran voice telling newcomers: **respect the altitude, train for long climbs, plan nutrition carefully, and don’t go out too hard**. Also, **enjoy the experience** – multiple commenters remind people to soak in the vibe at Twin Lakes and at the finish line, because it’s “absolutely electric” and will be a lifelong memory<u>[leadvilleraceseries.com](https://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/dispatches-from-columbine-top-10-things-to-know-before-your-first-leadville-trail-100-mtb/#:~:text=8,the%20finish%20line%20are%20deafening)</u>. The authenticity and frankness of these peer tips are valuable. As one Redditor succinctly put it after finishing his first Leadville (with a buckle): *“103 miles and 11,500 ft of vertical seemed impossible, but I am delighted I am bringing home a buckle from the Leadville 100 MTB”*<u>[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/comments/96v7cb/103_miles_and_11500_ft_of_vertical_seemed/#:~:text=103%20miles%20and%2011%2C500%20ft,from%20the%20Leadville%20100%20MTB)</u> – a sentiment that captures the mix of disbelief and joy many feel after conquering this beast.
## **TRAINERROAD FORUM**
The TrainerRoad Forum (forum.trainerroad.com) has a treasure trove of practical advice from cyclists who’ve done Leadville. Being a training-focused community, the discussions there often revolve around **training strategies, pacing with power, nutrition, and gear optimizations**. Key takeaways from popular threads:
* **Power Pacing & FTP at Altitude:** One TR forum thread was literally titled “Leadville 100 MTB…what w/kg for sub-9 or sub-12?” Users shared data and formulas. A rule cited: *“FTP decreases ~1% for every 1,000 feet above 3k (in feet)”*<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/adjusting-ftp-lthr-for-training-racing-at-altitude/56676#:~:text=good%20rule%20of%20thumb%3F)</u>. So at 10k ft, expect ~7% drop. Others said 2-3 W per 1000 ft lost<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/adjusting-ftp-lthr-for-training-racing-at-altitude/56676#:~:text=In%20the%20past%2C%20I%20used,out%20this%20problem%20more%20effectively)</u>. A coach on the forum simplified: *“At Leadville you’ll be riding all sections at a lower power than a typical TR workout. The hard part isn’t any one climb, but doing them back-to-back in a 103-mile ride (and at altitude)”*<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/leadville-100-mtb-2019/9737?page=2#:~:text=The%20hard%20part%20of%20Leadville,and%20at%20altitude)</u>. They emphasized **dialing in your Intensity Factor (IF)** for a ~9-12 hour effort – essentially figuring out what fraction of your sea-level FTP you can hold for that duration at altitude. Some aimed for ~0.6 IF for a 12-hour finish, ~0.7 IF for sub-9. TR users stressed **testing your limits on long training rides** to determine a sustainable pace. One poster noted: *“In a pre-ride 4 weeks before, I cleaned Powerline. But on race day, I walked the steep parts… So rather than training to smash one climb, it’s more important to dial in your pacing for the whole race”*<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/leadville-100-mtb-2019/9737?page=2#:~:text=The%20hard%20part%20of%20Leadville,and%20at%20altitude)</u><u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/leadville-100-mtb-2019/9737?page=2#:~:text=In%20a%20pre%20ride%204,all%20of%20the%20steep%20parts)</u>.
* **Sweet Spot Training & Endurance:** TrainerRoad’s plan for Leadville focuses on lots of Sweet Spot (moderately hard) intervals to build the ability to grind for hours. TR co-founder Nate Pearson, who attempted Leadville multiple times, advised: *“Sweet spot all day long – get good at riding at sweet spot, you’ll do this on the climbs”*<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/leadville-100-mtb-2019/9737?page=2#:~:text=My%20tips%3A)</u>. Essentially, threshold or VO2max efforts are less relevant; it’s about being able to sit just below threshold for very extended periods. Another user recommended doing some *over-distance* rides (100-150 miles) at lower intensities to get used to long hours in the saddle<u>[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/xcmtb/comments/1faphhr/training_for_leadville_100/#:~:text=Training%3A%20If%20you%20load%20yourself,climbs%20until%20legs%20are%20cooked)</u>. And *climbing, climbing, climbing* – if you live somewhere flat, you may need to simulate climbing via sustained trainer intervals or find wind/hills to push against<u>[leadvilleraceseries.com](https://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/dispatches-from-10000-feet-altitude-adjustment/#:~:text=The%20bigger%20challenge%20,%E2%80%9D%C2%A0%E2%80%93%20Todd%20Geer%2C%20Nebraska)</u><u>[leadvilleraceseries.com](https://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/dispatches-from-10000-feet-altitude-adjustment/#:~:text=during%20the%20race%2C%20and%20the,%E2%80%9D%C2%A0%E2%80%93%20Todd%20Geer%2C%20Nebraska)</u> (a Nebraskan said he did 20-min “hill simulation” intervals on flat windy roads to mimic sustained climbs<u>[leadvilleraceseries.com](https://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/dispatches-from-10000-feet-altitude-adjustment/#:~:text=The%20bigger%20challenge%20,provide%20great%20resistance%20and%20simulates)</u>).
* **Nutrition & Gut Training:** Perhaps the biggest topic on TR forum is **nutrition** – how to ingest enough calories (and tolerate it) for 9-12 hours. Nate Pearson highlighted: *“Train to eat. Think of it as your new discipline. Find the right combo of carbs to get 100g an hour or more.* ***I wish I would have done more of this earlier.****”*<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/leadville-100-mtb-2019/9737?page=2#:~:text=helmets,done%20more%20of%20this%20earlier)</u><u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/leadville-100-mtb-2019/9737?page=2#:~:text=3,done%20more%20of%20this%20earlier)</u>. This quote – “I wish I had practiced consuming 100g/hr sooner” – underscores how important fueling is. Many riders can’t stomach solid food at altitude, so they rely on liquid nutrition (carb drink mixes), gels, chews, etc. TR users suggest **aim for 60-90g of carbohydrate per hour minimum**, and practice this in training until your gut can handle it for 10 hours straight. One common tip: bring variety – your taste buds might revolt if you have the same flavor gel 20 times. Also, **don’t neglect fluids**: at altitude you dehydrate faster, so a hydration pack or two bottles per hour was recommended by some. Caffeine strategy was discussed too: some riders avoid caffeine for weeks prior, then use it as a performance booster on race day (consuming caffeine in the latter half to perk up, but caution not to overdo it and cause heart rate spikes)<u>[alphaarchitect.com](https://alphaarchitect.com/how-to-survive-the-leadville-100-trail-run/#:~:text=Finally%2C%20I%20stopped%20drinking%20coffee,stupid%20race%2C%20but%20her%20biggest)</u><u>[alphaarchitect.com](https://alphaarchitect.com/how-to-survive-the-leadville-100-trail-run/#:~:text=So%20what%E2%80%99s%20the%20bottom%20line,don%E2%80%99t%20have%20a%20heart%20attack)</u>.
* **Gear and Aero:** The TR forum is very data-driven, so folks talk about weight vs rolling resistance vs aerodynamics. There was consensus that **aero gains matter** in Leadville, especially on the long flat-ish segments (Pipeline road, paved sections). Nate Pearson noted riders losing watts with baggy clothing or non-aero helmets<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/leadville-100-mtb-2019/9737?page=2#:~:text=1,done%20more%20of%20this%20earlier)</u>. He personally wore a skinsuit and aero road helmet during his attempts. Many forum users agreed that if you’re chasing a specific time, you should treat it like a road time trial in many respects – tuck on descents, draft on flats, minimize drag where you can. On the other hand, **bike weight** also matters for all the climbing (12,000 ft of up). TR discussions balanced this: e.g. a dropper post adds ~300g, but some kept it for comfort on descents (one said 330g is only 0.3% of total system weight, “meh”<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/leadville-100-mtb-2019/9737?page=9#:~:text=%3E%20Dropper%20post%20,it%20off%20due%20to%20weight)</u>). Tires: go for low-resistance XC race tires, but don’t go so weight-weenie that you risk flats. **Tire inserts** got some mention for protecting rims on Powerline descent; a few used CushCore, etc., but others didn’t bother. **Suspension:** Many top age-groupers use hardtails or short-travel bikes with lockouts – the forum’s logic: less bobbing, more direct power transfer on climbs and smoother sections. A full-suspension is fine (especially modern ones with efficient platforms); just lock it out on the road climbs.
* **Altitude Prep:** The TR forum had threads about adjusting training for altitude when you can’t actually train at altitude. Some used “PH” (Performance Handicap) charts to modify FTP for altitude training. Others advised doing high-end work at lower altitude and focusing on volume at high altitude. In one thread, a user sleeping at 5,500ft and training weekends at 9,000ft asked how to adjust his FTP – responses suggested using ~1% per 1k ft above 3k rule, and adjusting his power targets down 4-7% for his 9,000ft workouts<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/adjusting-ftp-lthr-for-training-racing-at-altitude/56676#:~:text=good%20rule%20of%20thumb%3F)</u><u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/adjusting-ftp-lthr-for-training-racing-at-altitude/56676#:~:text=The%20charts%20Landis%20posted%20are,every%201000%20feet%20above%203k)</u>. Another TR tip: if you can’t acclimate long-term, try to arrive just at the last minute or do a short trip a few weeks before to “feel it” mentally<u>[leadvilleraceseries.com](https://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/dispatches-from-10000-feet-altitude-adjustment/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThat%20is%20a%20great%20question,to%20be%20on%20race%20day)</u> (several did a 2-3 day Colorado trip a month out to remind themselves what altitude feels like).
* **Race Strategy / Tactics:** A *great post on TR forum by user DaveWh laid out a detailed strategy for starting from a slower corral and moving up through the field:*<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/leadville-100-mtb-2019/9737?page=9#:~:text=,%E2%80%9Cfaster%E2%80%9D%20guys%20from%20the%20gun)</u><u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/leadville-100-mtb-2019/9737?page=9#:~:text=You%E2%80%99ll%20continually%20gain%20time%20throughout%2C,road%20section%20of%20columbine%20climb)</u>. He advised an athlete (~4.7 W/kg) that if you’re stuck behind people at the start: use the **first paved downhill** to pass groups (tuck and fly by), then on the initial dirt climb (St. Kevins) don’t waste energy trying to pass in the crowded singletrack – *“just chill until it opens up”*<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/leadville-100-mtb-2019/9737?page=9#:~:text=start)</u>. After the hairpin it widens and you can overtake for a bit before it narrows again. He noted **Sugarloaf climb** has spots to pass (two or three lines on the jeep road)<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/leadville-100-mtb-2019/9737?page=9#:~:text=On%20the%20sugarloaf%20climb%20you%E2%80%99ll,usually%202%2C%20sometimes%203%20lines)</u> – a good place to gain positions. By the **Powerline descent**, be careful but you can pass some folks if needed. He predicted that by the bottom of Powerline, a strong rider who started in a later wave could be among riders on 9-10h pace already<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/leadville-100-mtb-2019/9737?page=9#:~:text=That%20should%20put%20you%20in,just%20need%20to%20be%20careful)</u>. He then stressed the importance of **pacelining on the Pipeline/Twin Lakes flats**: *“By Twin Lakes inbound, you’ll want to be with the sub-9 guys. That section (Pipeline inbound) likely has a headwind, so having a group to work with is most important there”*<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/leadville-100-mtb-2019/9737?page=9#:~:text=chilling%20in%20these%20sections%2C%20and,save%20energy%20for%20later)</u><u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/leadville-100-mtb-2019/9737?page=9#:~:text=By%20the%20time%20you%20get,be%20riding%20into%20a%20headwind)</u>. He also warned of the **Columbine bottleneck** – you will inevitably get caught behind a walking line near the top, so *“just chill and save energy for later rather than stressing about a few minutes lost”*<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/leadville-100-mtb-2019/9737?page=9#:~:text=columbine%20climb)</u><u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/leadville-100-mtb-2019/9737?page=9#:~:text=You%E2%80%99ll%20get%20caught%20again%20in,and%20save%20energy%20for%20later)</u>. This advice encapsulates: make up time where you can (flats, downhills, easier climbs) but accept slowdowns where the course/traffic dictates (Kevins singletrack, hike-a-bikes). Lots of forum users echoed that *patience early* pays off big in the final hours.
* **Qualifiers and Corrals:** TR discussions also cover the Leadville **qualifier events** (like Austin Rattler, Silver Rush 50, etc.). Many recommended doing one if possible, not only to secure an entry coin but to get a better starting corral. Faster corrals = less traffic = faster times. One TR user shared: *“Do a qualifier to test your nutrition strategy and get a better corral. If you got in via lottery with no corral, you’ll be in the back (White). It’s really worth trying to move up”*<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/leadville-100-mtb-2019/9737?page=2#:~:text=I%20also%20recommend%20doing%20a,through%20the%20lottery%20to%20both)</u>. He noted if you can’t, there are tricks like moving up when they remove the tape between corrals at the start (historically you could slide into a faster group if you were sneaky)<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/leadville-100-mtb-2019/9737?page=2#:~:text=If%20you%20want%20to%20go,better%20position%20at%20the%20start)</u> – though with wave starts implemented in 2019, that became less relevant. After 2019 they started by colored waves separated by a few minutes, which actually reduced congestion on St. Kevins<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/leadville-100-mtb-2019/9737?page=2#:~:text=Looks%20like%20there%20is%20a,rather%20than%20all%20at%20once)</u><u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/leadville-100-mtb-2019/9737?page=2#:~:text=Wave%201%3A%20Gold%2C%20Silver%2C%20Red,White%20or%20no%20corral%206%3A42)</u>. Nate Pearson thought the wave start made it easier overall (less dust and crowding)<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/leadville-100-mtb-2019/9737?page=2#:~:text=Podcasts%20itunes)</u><u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/leadville-100-mtb-2019/9737?page=2#:~:text=Wow%21%20I%20think%20this%20will,to%20connect%20with%20a%20red)</u>.
In summary, the **TrainerRoad Forum’s collective wisdom** for Leadville is: **do a ton of sweet spot and long rides** to build durable power, **practice eating and drinking** until consuming ~90g carbs/hour is second nature, **optimize your gear** to save watts (fast tires, aero clothing, light bike but not at reliability’s expense), and **have a pacing plan** based on your power numbers – then stick to it and adjust for altitude. They repeatedly say *“there’s no one climb that will kill you, it’s the accumulation”*. So focus on being strong in hour 8,9,10 – not just crushing hour 1. And small details like starting position, wind drafting, and aid station stops (minimize them!) can be the difference in getting that buckle. As one forum user put it after finishing: *“Leadville is essentially an eating and pacing contest disguised as a mountain bike race.”* It’s clear the TR community sees success at Leadville as a puzzle of fitness, fueling, and strategy – a puzzle that can be solved with enough preparation.
## **YOUTUBE RACE REPORTS**
There’s a wealth of **Leadville 100 MTB content on YouTube**, ranging from pro rider vlogs and official race coverage to amateur GoPro diaries. These videos provide a visceral sense of the course and the race day emotions. Some notable examples and moments:
* **Official Highlights & Pro Footage:** The Leadville Race Series released a produced **2025 race recap video** (from their first-ever live broadcast in 2025)<u>[leadvilleraceseries.com](https://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/mtb/leadvilletrail100mtb/#:~:text=WATCH)</u><u>[youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYrSnYf1Htk#:~:text=2025%20Life%20Time%20Leadville%20100,100%20MTB%20presented%20by)</u>. It showcases front-of-pack action: you see lead riders like Keegan Swenson and Kate Courtney drilling the pace in pacelines, the helicopter shots of the massive field, and dramatic finishes. For instance, the 2023 highlight reel (Life Time Grand Prix coverage) shows Swenson attacking solo on Columbine and cresting it alone, then crossing the line in record time<u>[pinkbike.com](https://www.pinkbike.com/news/results-leadville-trail-100-mtb-race.html#:~:text=After%20the%20race%2C%20Swenson%20revealed,eight%20minutes%20on%20the%20chasers)</u><u>[pinkbike.com](https://www.pinkbike.com/news/results-leadville-trail-100-mtb-race.html#:~:text=of%20the%20way%20up%20the,eight%20minutes%20on%20the%20chasers)</u>. The women’s highlight shows Kate Courtney summiting Columbine in the lead in 2025<u>[youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wtbQmP9ugM#:~:text=Kate%20Courtney%20Summits%20Columbine%20Mine,Stevens%2C%20Kate%2C%20and%20Melisa%20Rollins)</u>. These videos give a sense of how *fast* the elite race is: they climb Columbine in just over an hour, whereas mid-pack might take 2+ hours. They also often include **Ken Chlouber’s famous shotgun start** and some words from him and Merilee at the awards, which is part of Leadville’s lore.
* **The “Famous Columbine Footage”:** Perhaps what the user meant by “famous Columbine footage” refers to the dramatic scenes of riders walking near the top of Columbine, with others descending at speed – something often captured in documentaries. The 2009 documentary “Race Across The Sky” had iconic shots: Lance Armstrong bombing down Columbine while a parade of others slog upward on foot, many giving him a cheer. Modern YouTube vlogs also capture this. For example, a video titled “Climbing up Columbine Mine” (by a YouTuber) shows the slow grind above treeline, riders literally saying *“we’re almost there, one step at a time!”* as they push bikes in thin air<u>[joinbasecamp.com](https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/shawns-story-leadville-100?srsltid=AfmBOoryXL74ixQ1OBO_3wvLuo7lEru7_mjJPuWTPHhnyUQfRHiriRnT#:~:text=Columbine%20was%20a%20kick%20in,WE%27RE%20ALMOST%20TO%20THE%20TOP)</u><u>[joinbasecamp.com](https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/shawns-story-leadville-100?srsltid=AfmBOoryXL74ixQ1OBO_3wvLuo7lEru7_mjJPuWTPHhnyUQfRHiriRnT#:~:text=jeep%20trail%20with%20a%20deep,WE%27RE%20ALMOST%20TO%20THE%20TOP)</u>. Another YouTube clip shows the entire **Columbine descent** POV in 9 minutes<u>[youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEpRaGLegQA#:~:text=Columbine%20Climb%20,iPhone%20tucked)</u> – you can see how long and bumpy it is, and passing slower folks carefully. So yes, that *visual* of the Columbine conga line is famous – a helicopter shot of the switchbacks with hundreds of tiny figures – it’s been in many promo videos.
* **Pro Vlogs and Documentaries:** Many pros document their Leadville attempts. Notably, **Alexey Vermeulen and Ryan Petry’s “From the Ground Up” series** on YouTube followed three novice cyclists training for Leadville under their mentorship (2021 and subsequent seasons)<u>[youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/@FromTheGroundUpProject#:~:text=From%20the%20Ground%20Up%20is,prepare%20to%20take%20on)</u>. It’s a fascinating watch to see rookies struggle through training and then the race. They show a lot of on-course footage, including back-of-pack perspectives (like people finishing just under 12h). Another is **GCN (Global Cycling Network)** – presenter Hank did the LeadBoat challenge (Leadville 100 on Saturday, SBT Gravel 140 miles on Sunday) and GCN posted videos of his preparation and suffering. He experienced altitude issues (being from sea level) and gave an honest view of how hard it was just to finish around 11 hours.
* **Back-of-Pack POV:** A YouTuber named “Kym Nonstop” (Liv Cycling) made a video racing Leadville as an amateur; she struggled with mechanicals and the time cutoffs. It’s useful to see the stress as cutoffs loom. Another, “The Vegan Cyclist” made a popular race report in 2018 documenting his sub-9 attempt (he missed it by a bit and had to come back another year). He filmed while riding, capturing moments like early crashes, the grind up Powerline with cramps, and the emotional finish where he collapsed off the bike. These personal vlogs really convey the **emotional rollercoaster**: you’ll often see tears, either from exhaustion or joy, at the finish. One first-timer’s vlog shows him crossing in ~11:30, then literally lying on the ground whimpering in pain but also happiness. Classic line: *“I... I don't ever want to do that again... but also maybe I do?”* while his friend pours Coke in his mouth.
* **Notable Media Coverage Videos:** Outside TV / Velonews have done mini-docs. In 2018, they followed Howard Grotts and some age-groupers – the video “Call of Leadville” or similar (featuring Howard and also a 60-year-old). **Sonya Looney**, a former champion, has a 2012 helmet-cam video and blog (Elevation Outdoors magazine)<u>[elevationoutdoors.com](https://www.elevationoutdoors.com/blogs/alpine-adventures/leadville-100-race-report/#:~:text=Leadville%20100%20Race%20Report%20,ride%20the%20steep%20top)</u> describing her race. She shows the **start line energy** and the huge crowds.
* **Unique Angles:** Some videos focus on specific aspects: e.g., one titled “Leadville’s Powerline descent w/ Brady” on Instagram shows just how steep and loose that downhill is<u>[instagram.com](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DNl2VviuB3K/#:~:text=Leadville%27s%20Powerline%20descent%20w%2F%20%40bradyn,only%20caught%20the%20first)</u>. Another creative video in 2021 had a guy set out to break the **Columbine ascent FKT** (fastest known time) outside of race – he failed due to altitude, and the video (on YouTube) is humorously titled “Columbine Climb FAILED FKT”<u>[youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2RGih8cnJY#:~:text=Leadville%20100%20MTB%20,in%20the%20Leadville%20trail%20100)</u>, but it gives a good look at that climb outside of race context.
* **Live Streams:** Starting in 2022, Life Time began live-streaming the race online. The **2025 Leadville 100 LIVE coverage** on YouTube (by Orange Seal) was a several-hour broadcast with commentators following the men’s and women’s leaders via helicopter and moto cams<u>[youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkW-ZHjVRkc#:~:text=2025%20Life%20Time%20Leadville%20Trail,100%20MTB%20presented%20by%20Kenetik)</u>. It’s great for enthusiasts to see the **real-time dynamics** (e.g., pace lining on pavement, the decisive attacks on Columbine). In the 2025 live, you can watch Kate Courtney and others grinding up Columbine, and see the elevation break even the pros (they were crawling near the top). If you scan through that, you’ll catch moments like Keegan cresting Powerline solo and essentially time-trialing to a fifth consecutive win<u>[silca.cc](https://silca.cc/blogs/silca/2025-leadville-100-mtb?srsltid=AfmBOop-dm4_mSDSsW_MIYe_Jfvm6QBA427eH9p7rsqtgtPsVvOA9vvc#:~:text=This%20year%27s%20race%20was%20another,of%20boom%20can%20be%20found)</u>.
* **Finish Line Videos:** There are lots of finish line clips, including the **emotional last finisher moments**. It’s common for people to film the countdown to 12h at the red carpet – the crowd goes nuts cheering in the final riders. YouTube likely has “Leadville 100 12 hour cutoff finish” videos. These show Merilee (race director) hugging people and handing out buckles right at the line. It might bring a tear to your eye – truly the spirit of Leadville.
Overall, **YouTube race reports illustrate** a few consistent themes: the sheer scale of the event (hundreds of riders stretching for miles), the beauty of the course (shots from Columbine’s summit of endless mountains), and the suffering and camaraderie (people encouraging each other with words like *“we got this!”* on the climbs, or sharing a laugh at the aid stations). If one is preparing for Leadville, watching these videos can be invaluable to mentally prepare. As one amateur vlogger said on camera during a brutal moment on Powerline: *“This climb… is death. But look at everyone around – we’re all in it together.”* That sense of shared struggle comes across strongly on YouTube.
**Recommended videos:**

Watching these, one comes to appreciate Ken Chlouber’s famous start-line quote (which is invariably included in many videos): *“You are better than you think you are, and you can do more than you think you can!”* It booms out over the PA at dawn. Then the gun goes off, hundreds of riders clip in, and the epic journey unfolds – captured in countless YouTube clips for posterity.
## **RACE REPORTS & BLOGS**
Over decades of Leadville, riders have penned detailed **race reports and blog posts**, offering insight beyond the stats. These personal accounts often highlight the challenges with honesty and humor. Some key points extracted from blogs:
* **Course Surprises:** Many first-timers note things they *didn’t expect*. One common one: *“It’s not really 100 miles, but 103 – and those last 3 feel extremely hard.”*<u>[leadvilleraceseries.com](https://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/dispatches-from-columbine-top-10-things-to-know-before-your-first-leadville-trail-100-mtb/#:~:text=3,last%20three%20feel%20extremely%20hard)</u> This was mentioned by Rebecca Rusch in her “Top 10 Things” article, and echoed by others. People who didn’t pre-ride the finish are often mentally crushed by the Boulevard climb. Blogger Rachel H. (Alto Velo Racing) wrote: *“I was quite surprised to be sailing towards town on pavement, only to be detoured onto dirt for another climb before the finish… I suggest at least riding this last section so you can wrap your head around it”*<u>[leadvilleraceseries.com](https://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/dispatches-from-columbine-top-10-things-to-know-before-your-first-leadville-trail-100-mtb/#:~:text=The%20finish%20is%20not%20the,course%20alone%20before%20race%20day)</u>. She indeed pre-rode the final miles alone the day before, which helped her visualize that ending.
* **Altitude and Physical Toll:** Blogs invariably mention how the **thin air and long climbs took a toll**. Rachel’s 2024 race report noted: *“Near the top [of Columbine], the air was thin, my legs were cramping, and I got off like most people around me to walk up the chunky loose rock, single file, as racers came down next to us”*<u>[altovelo.org](https://www.altovelo.org/race-reports/race-report-2024-leadville-trail-100-mtb#:~:text=far%20behind,their%20sponsored%20gels%2C%20chugged%20half)</u><u>[altovelo.org](https://www.altovelo.org/race-reports/race-report-2024-leadville-trail-100-mtb#:~:text=the%20beautiful%20mountain%20backdrop,banana%20in%20hopes%20of%20uncramping)</u>. She vividly described reaching the summit: slamming some Coke and banana, trying to uncramp<u>[altovelo.org](https://www.altovelo.org/race-reports/race-report-2024-leadville-trail-100-mtb#:~:text=Anyways%2C%20near%20the%20top%20of,banana%20in%20hopes%20of%20uncramping)</u>. Then on the descent: *“The downhill was fun. It wasn’t anything technical – just trying to stay upright and not crash while staying focused”*<u>[altovelo.org](https://www.altovelo.org/race-reports/race-report-2024-leadville-trail-100-mtb#:~:text=The%20downhill%20was%20fun,wrong%20rest%20stop%20%E2%80%93%20SMH)</u>. That sentiment (“fun descent, not technical”) appears in several reports – indicating relief that the hardest part (the climb) is over, and confirming the course is fairly non-technical even when tired.
* **Nutrition and Mistakes:** Many race reports discuss nutrition successes or errors. For example, Rachel admitted by mile ~80 she started losing interest in eating: *“By that point, I wasn’t thinking of nutrition anymore. My bottle-an-hour turned into maybe one every 2 hours. I was already under-fueling, and after that, severely behind”*<u>[altovelo.org](https://www.altovelo.org/race-reports/race-report-2024-leadville-trail-100-mtb#:~:text=two%20in%20front%20of%20me,just%20water%20on%20my%20bike)</u>. This contributed to her late-race bonk and mental low at Pipeline inbound. She even said she told her crew *“I don’t want to do this anymore”* at mile ~76<u>[altovelo.org](https://www.altovelo.org/race-reports/race-report-2024-leadville-trail-100-mtb#:~:text=Quick%20stop%2C%20and%20I%20kept,I%20was%20already%20under)</u> – a raw confession of that dark moment many face. Another blogger might mention *“I got so sick of gels that I couldn’t choke anything down after Twin Lakes inbound”*. These lessons underline the importance of variety and forcing nutrition even when you’re sick of it. On the other hand, some report fueling triumphs – e.g., one said he managed 300 calories/hour consistently and that saved him from cramping.
* **Gear Lessons:** Many bloggers share what they’d do differently gear-wise. For instance, *tire pressure*: Rachel started with 23 psi front / 25 psi rear but found the washboards brutal, so at an aid stop she bled ~5 psi out of each<u>[altovelo.org](https://www.altovelo.org/race-reports/race-report-2024-leadville-trail-100-mtb#:~:text=no%20rain%20%E2%80%93%20the%20most,It%20was%20a%20while)</u>. *“It felt infinitely better – definitely running 20s from the start next time,”* she wrote<u>[altovelo.org](https://www.altovelo.org/race-reports/race-report-2024-leadville-trail-100-mtb#:~:text=no%20rain%20%E2%80%93%20the%20most,of%20the%20race%20was%20probably)</u>. Others mention wishing for a larger cassette gear (the steep climbs had them grinding – a few extra teeth on the granny cog would have let them spin). Some regret not having a dropper post on the Powerline descent; others regret carrying something they never used (like too much water or a heavy pack). One blog from 2013 by Steve (Rodeo Labs) said he had dismissed Leadville as “arbitrary suffering” but after doing it, he wrote about the culture and the *why* behind it. He also noted gear: he rode a 21-lb hardtail with semi-slicks and that was fine.
* **Emotional Highs and Lows:** Blogs capture the emotional journey well. Many describe a euphoric high at Twin Lakes with the cheering crowds (“It gave me a huge energy rush”<u>[leadvilleraceseries.com](https://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/dispatches-from-columbine-top-10-things-to-know-before-your-first-leadville-trail-100-mtb/#:~:text=8,the%20finish%20line%20are%20deafening)</u>). Then a soul-crushing low somewhere on the return (often on Powerline or the stretch after). The Alto Velo blogger Rachel had a low at Pipeline inbound where she went to the wrong crew station, got frantic, then realized her mistake and felt demoralized<u>[altovelo.org](https://www.altovelo.org/race-reports/race-report-2024-leadville-trail-100-mtb#:~:text=The%20downhill%20was%20fun,wrong%20rest%20stop%20%E2%80%93%20SMH)</u>. She recovered after seeing her support crew at the correct spot, where they rubbed her legs and gave her fresh bottles<u>[altovelo.org](https://www.altovelo.org/race-reports/race-report-2024-leadville-trail-100-mtb#:~:text=minutes%20later%20realizing%20I%20was,wrong%20rest%20stop%20%E2%80%93%20SMH)</u>. Another blog (Elevation Outdoors by Sonya Looney, 2012 winner) describes her nearly **quitting at Columbine** due to stomach issues, but then soldiering on. In *“My First Hundred – Lessons Learned”* by Addie Bracy (run, but parallels), she says you inevitably enter the “pain cave” and you have to decide to keep pushing. Blogs often finish with a mix of pride and relief: *“I crossed in 11:00:28 – exhausted, elated, and already forgetting the pain.”* One runner’s blog said: *“I swore ‘never again’ at the finish, but 2 hours later I was talking about how to improve next time.”* That amnesia and desire to come back is common.
* **Logistics and Community:** Some blogs provide great logistical tidbits: lodging in Leadville is limited, many stay in nearby towns (one group stayed in Copper Mountain and had a 4am wakeup drive, as noted in the Silca report<u>[silca.cc](https://silca.cc/blogs/silca/2025-leadville-100-mtb?srsltid=AfmBOop-dm4_mSDSsW_MIYe_Jfvm6QBA427eH9p7rsqtgtPsVvOA9vvc#:~:text=5%3A00%20The%20Start%20Line%20and,Warm%20Up)</u>). They mention the **Race Across the Sky Expo** in downtown Leadville – worth visiting for the atmosphere and last-minute gear (and free swag)<u>[leadvilleraceseries.com](https://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/mtb/leadvilletrail100mtb/#:~:text=RACE%20ACROSS%20THE%20SKY%20EXPO)</u>. They talk about **volunteers** – almost every race report praises the volunteers: *“The aid station crews were amazing – filling bottles, handing me food, even pouring water on my head.”* Leadville’s volunteer ethos is strong (many are local families or longtime helpers). The motto *“Trail-wide smile”* is often used to describe how friendly everyone is despite the suffering.
* **Results and DNF rates:** Some blog posts include stats. The Rodeo Labs 2013 piece noted “with a field limit of ~2000, and >5000 applicants, demand is high”<u>[rodeo-labs.com](https://www.rodeo-labs.com/leadville-100-unsorted-musings/#:~:text=even%20more%20resources%20into%20boosting,achievements%20many%20people%20aspire%20to)</u>. Another (trainright) pointed out only 9% of finishers in 2023 were women<u>[trainright.com](https://trainright.com/leadville-100-problem-women-representation/#:~:text=Working%20an%20aid%20station%20at,and%20that%E2%80%99s%20a%20problem)</u>, sparking conversation about representation. A blogger might mention “X% didn’t finish this year due to weather” etc. For example, in 2014 it rained hard and DNF rate was higher – a blog said “200+ riders dropped out.” If the user is interested in DNF data: historically, finish rates are surprisingly high (often 90%+), partly because anyone extremely unprepared likely doesn’t make it past the qualifiers or early cutoffs. But weather can change that.
* **Historical Perspective:** Some older blogs reflect on how the race has changed. One might note the influence of Lance Armstrong’s win in 2009 bringing more attention (Rodeo Labs mentioned that and Lifetime’s purchase)<u>[rodeo-labs.com](https://www.rodeo-labs.com/leadville-100-unsorted-musings/#:~:text=legend%20to%20many%20since%20it,achievements%20many%20people%20aspire%20to)</u>. Others talk about how the times have gotten faster (course records tumbling). The community aspect remains: things like the pre-race **pancake breakfast** at the high school, or the **night before pre-race meeting** where Ken and Merilee speak and the last crew bags are dropped – these experiences often find mention, as they add to the lore.
In summary, **race report blogs** provide color to the raw data: altitude headaches, cramping legs, the taste of warm Coke at an aid station, the sound of 1,700 riders clipping in at sunrise, the sight of Mount Massive and Elbert bathed in golden light (yes, people wax poetic about the scenery too!). A good quote from a 2023 finisher’s blog: *“There were times I was literally crying and pedaling at the same time – from pain, from joy, who knows. Leadville will do that to you.”* This mix of agony and ecstasy is a running theme in nearly every account of the “Race Across the Sky.”
## **MEDIA COVERAGE**
The Leadville Trail 100 has been covered by major cycling media – **VeloNews, Cycling Weekly, Pinkbike, Singletracks, Outside,** etc., often focusing on the competitive race at the sharp end or notable storylines.
**VeloNews / CyclingWeekly:** These outlets tend to highlight the **elite racers and tech trends**. For instance, Cycling Weekly ran a 2025 piece titled *“Why pros are racing the biggest MTB race on drop bars and ‘Franken-bikes’”*<u>[cyclingweekly.com](https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/why-pros-are-racing-the-biggest-mtb-race-in-the-us-on-drop-bars-and-frankenstein-bikes#:~:text=Why%20pros%20are%20racing%20the,drop%20bars%20and%20%E2%80%98Frankenstein%20bikes%E2%80%99)</u>. It explained how Leadville’s less-technical nature led pros like Keegan Swenson, Lachlan Morton, and others to experiment with drop handlebars, aero kits, and gravel bike setups for an edge<u>[cyclingweekly.com](https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/why-pros-are-racing-the-biggest-mtb-race-in-the-us-on-drop-bars-and-frankenstein-bikes#:~:text=shed%20every%20possible%20gram%2C%20stripped,altitude%20terrain)</u><u>[cyclingweekly.com](https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/why-pros-are-racing-the-biggest-mtb-race-in-the-us-on-drop-bars-and-frankenstein-bikes#:~:text=Leadville%20is%20the%20biggest%2C%20most,the%20summit%20of%20Columbine%20Mine)</u>. Quote: *“Leadville… defined by long, tough climbs and exposed course with surprisingly little singletrack. Because of this unique blend, unconventional bikes have long been part of Leadville… with drop-bar builds resurfacing”*<u>[cyclingweekly.com](https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/why-pros-are-racing-the-biggest-mtb-race-in-the-us-on-drop-bars-and-frankenstein-bikes#:~:text=Leadville%20is%20the%20biggest%2C%20most,the%20summit%20of%20Columbine%20Mine)</u><u>[cyclingweekly.com](https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/why-pros-are-racing-the-biggest-mtb-race-in-the-us-on-drop-bars-and-frankenstein-bikes#:~:text=Because%20of%20this%20unique%20blend,pointy%20end%20of%20the%20race)</u>. They noted Keegan’s 2023 win on essentially a rigid frame with drop bars, and the incremental arms race in equipment. Another trend article was about **aero bars** (some years ago many age-groupers stuck short clip-on aero bars for the flats; Lifetime later banned clip-on aero bars in MTB events for safety<u>[leadvilleraceseries.com](https://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024_EVCO-LRS_100MTB_AthleteGuide.pdf#:~:text=with%20pink%2Fblack%20pink%20flags%20and,1%202%203)</u>, and that rule is now in effect). Media outlets have also covered the **Life Time Grand Prix** aspect – Leadville is one of the races in that multi-race series for pros, so they discuss how it factors into those standings<u>[leadvilleraceseries.com](https://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/mtb/leadvilletrail100mtb/#:~:text=2025%20was%20an%20absolutely%20unforgettable,moments%20that%20defined%20race%20day)</u>.
**Race Results Coverage:** Sites like Pinkbike and VeloNews publish news posts with the podiums and times. For example, *“Results: 2023 Leadville 100 – Swenson smashes record”* was on Pinkbike<u>[pinkbike.com](https://www.pinkbike.com/news/results-leadville-trail-100-mtb-race.html#:~:text=The%20results%20are%20in%20from,Check%20out%20the%20results%20below)</u><u>[pinkbike.com](https://www.pinkbike.com/news/results-leadville-trail-100-mtb-race.html#:~:text=Keegan%20Swenson%20smashed%20the%20longstanding,Check%20out%20the%20results%20below)</u>. They reported: *“Keegan Swenson smashed the longstanding course record of 5:58:35 by more than 15 minutes (finishing in 5:43:31)*<u>*[pinkbike.com](https://www.pinkbike.com/news/results-leadville-trail-100-mtb-race.html#:~:text=The%20results%20are%20in%20from,Check%20out%20the%20results%20below)*</u><u>*[pinkbike.com](https://www.pinkbike.com/news/results-leadville-trail-100-mtb-race.html#:~:text=riders%20from%20the%20Life%20Time,Check%20out%20the%20results%20below)*</u>*. Sofia Gomez Villafañe won the women’s in 7:09, also one of the fastest times ever”*. These articles often include **quotes from the winners**: e.g., Keegan said, *“I was so short of the record last year, so this year I went all in… I didn’t want to just beat it by seconds, I wanted to make it mine”*<u>[pinkbike.com](https://www.pinkbike.com/news/results-leadville-trail-100-mtb-race.html#:~:text=Image%3A%20bigquotesI%20was%20so%20short,%E2%80%94Keegan%C2%A0Swenson)</u>.

These media pieces give context like *“a field of 1,750 riders competed… 70 of them Life Time Grand Prix pros”*<u>[pinkbike.com](https://www.pinkbike.com/news/results-leadville-trail-100-mtb-race.html#:~:text=The%20results%20are%20in%20from,5%3A58%3A35%20by%20more%20than%2015)</u>. They often mention notable names: e.g., Howard Grotts (3x winner), Levi Leipheimer (2010 winner), Rebecca Rusch (4x women’s winner) – who all have records or near-records. They also mention **Lance Armstrong’s involvement** raising the race’s profile in 2009-2010<u>[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadville_Trail_100_MTB#:~:text=Lance%20Armstrong%20by%20just%20under,Trail%20100%20MTB%2C%20evidenced%20by)</u><u>[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadville_Trail_100_MTB#:~:text=establishing%20a%20new%20course%20record,Trail%20100%20MTB%2C%20evidenced%20by)</u>.

Media coverage in 2023 highlighted how **times have dropped** thanks to pro participation and equipment – “Swenson shed everyone by 1/3 up Columbine and won by 25 minutes”<u>[pinkbike.com](https://www.pinkbike.com/news/results-leadville-trail-100-mtb-race.html#:~:text=After%20the%20race%2C%20Swenson%20revealed,eight%20minutes%20on%20the%20chasers)</u><u>[pinkbike.com](https://www.pinkbike.com/news/results-leadville-trail-100-mtb-race.html#:~:text=of%20the%20way%20up%20the,eight%20minutes%20on%20the%20chasers)</u>, which is mind-blowing.
**Human Interest Stories:** Sometimes outlets do stories on inspiring participants – e.g., a 70-year-old finisher, or an adaptive athlete (Leadville has had para categories or special participants). Outside did a piece on the **gender imbalance** (in 2023 only ~9% women) and efforts to increase women’s participation<u>[trainright.com](https://trainright.com/leadville-100-problem-women-representation/#:~:text=Working%20an%20aid%20station%20at,and%20that%E2%80%99s%20a%20problem)</u><u>[trainright.com](https://trainright.com/leadville-100-problem-women-representation/#:~:text=who%20was%20tracking%20down%20race,and%20that%E2%80%99s%20a%20problem)</u>. Another example: a profile of Ken Chlouber or Merilee O’Neal around the race’s 30th anniversary in 2023, talking about the race’s origins and growth.
**Local Media:** The Colorado press usually covers it from a community angle – Leadville Herald or Denver Post highlighting the local volunteers, the economic impact (~$15 million economic boost to the region, etc.), and the tradition (some locals have done it 20 times etc.).
**Tech Coverage:** Pinkbike had a *“5 XC Race Bikes from 2025 Leadville”* gallery<u>[pinkbike.com](https://www.pinkbike.com/news/5-xc-race-bikes-from-the-2025-leadville-100.html#:~:text=It%27s%20a%20big%20weekend%20for,accomplishment%20in%20and%20of%20itself)</u> showcasing bikes of pros like Sarah Sturm, Dylan Johnson, etc. The trend: hardtails or very short-travel full-suspensions, lightweight builds, often with drop bars (Dylan Johnson’s rig had drop bars and a 36t chainring)<u>[pinkbike.com](https://www.pinkbike.com/news/5-xc-race-bikes-from-the-2025-leadville-100.html#:~:text=Dylan%20Johnson%27s%20Unno%20Horn%20Fork%3A,DuraAce%20Bottle%20cages%3A%20Silca%20Titanium)</u><u>[pinkbike.com](https://www.pinkbike.com/news/5-xc-race-bikes-from-the-2025-leadville-100.html#:~:text=Drivetrain%3A%20SRAM%20Eagle%20AXS%20,Titanium%20Computer%3A%20Wahoo%20Roam%203)</u>, low tire pressures (16-18 psi tubeless)<u>[pinkbike.com](https://www.pinkbike.com/news/5-xc-race-bikes-from-the-2025-leadville-100.html#:~:text=Frame%20size%3A%20medium%20Fork%3A%20Fox,22%20lb%20%2F%2010%20kg)</u>, no dropper posts in some cases (they explicitly note one rider had no dropper, just a rigid post and remote fork lockout, “fitting for this high-speed course without many technical sections”<u>[pinkbike.com](https://www.pinkbike.com/news/5-xc-race-bikes-from-the-2025-leadville-100.html#:~:text=Image%3A%20photo)</u>). Pinkbike’s commentary: *“No dropper post and a lockout – fitting setup for a high altitude course; it’s a high-speed race without too many technical bits”*<u>[pinkbike.com](https://www.pinkbike.com/news/5-xc-race-bikes-from-the-2025-leadville-100.html#:~:text=Image%3A%20photo)</u>. This confirms how even media sees Leadville as an outlier in MTB, almost like a road race at altitude.
**History and Legacy:** On big anniversaries, articles reminisce that the MTB race started in 1994 with 150 riders<u>[leadvilleraceseries.com](https://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/mtb/leadvilletrail100mtb/#:~:text=In%201994%2C%20150%20gutsy%20riders,The%20red%20carpet%20awaits)</u>, was born from the run, and how it helped save Leadville’s economy (the oft-told origin story of Ken Chlouber convincing locals that a race could bring money after the mine shutdown). In 2019 (the 25th MTB race), some pieces noted the race’s legendary status and listed past winners like Dave Wiens (6-time winner, who beat Floyd Landis and Lance), Rebecca Rusch (“Queen of Pain”), etc.
**Leadville vs Other Races:** Some media compare it to other endurance events – calling it *“America’s most famous mountain bike race”* or at least the most high-profile 100-miler. The Leadville 100 is often mentioned alongside the likes of the Cape Epic, Unbound Gravel, etc., as a bucket-list event. A CyclingWeekly article called Leadville *“the highest, hardest mountain bike race”*<u>[facebook.com](https://www.facebook.com/pinkbikecom/posts/the-leadville-trail-100-mtb-race-may-get-a-lot-of-flack-for-not-being-a-real-mou/868072198010626/#:~:text=The%20Leadville%20Trail%20100%20MTB,climbs%20to%20over%2012%2C300)</u>, though some purists argue there are harder ones technically (like the Shenandoah 100 or Pisgah). Still, due to the altitude and cutoffs, Leadville is uniquely challenging and has earned a kind of legendary mystique, which media love to play up.
**Interesting Stat from Media:** One trainright article by CTS noted in 2023, *“Larissa Connors won the 2018 women’s by 27 minutes… but in 2023, the women’s field is deeper”* – indicating how competition is growing. Also an analysis in 2023 pointed out that times improved possibly due to conditions: *“Conditions were good, course was fast and tacky”*, as Keegan noted<u>[pinkbike.com](https://www.pinkbike.com/news/results-leadville-trail-100-mtb-race.html#:~:text=Image%3A%20bigquotesI%20was%20so%20short,%E2%80%94Keegan%C2%A0Swenson)</u>. Sometimes media remark on weather for context (e.g., 2016 saw rain so times were slower, etc.).
In essence, **media coverage** celebrates both the elite race at the front and the mass-participation achievement. You’ll often see a dual narrative: “Pros battle for the win and records, while hundreds of amateur riders fight to earn the coveted buckles.” It’s not unusual for reports to end with a line like, *“As the winners basked in their glory, the final finisher crossed the line just under 12 hours, greeted by the founders and a roar of the crowd – embodying the spirit of Leadville.”* This race has decades of history, so every year’s media stories add another chapter to the legend of the Race Across The Sky.
## **RESULTS & DNF DATA (BUCKLE STATISTICS)**
**Finisher & Buckle Stats:** The vast majority of riders who start the Leadville 100 MTB *do* finish (thanks to the qualifiers and strict cutoffs ensuring a capable field). In recent years, finish rates have been in the 90-95% range. For example, in 2023 there were **1561 starters and 1538 finishers** (98.5% finished)<u>[trainright.com](https://trainright.com/leadville-100-problem-women-representation/#:~:text=Working%20an%20aid%20station%20at,and%20that%E2%80%99s%20a%20problem)</u><u>[trainright.com](https://trainright.com/leadville-100-problem-women-representation/#:~:text=1538%20finishers%20,and%20that%E2%80%99s%20a%20problem)</u> – exceptional conditions helped that. More commonly, you might see around 1300-1400 finishers out of ~1600 starters (80-90%). Weather is a big factor: a heavy rain year could drop the finisher count. But generally, if you make it past the mid-race cutoffs, you’re likely to finish because the later cutoffs weed out those far off pace.
In terms of **buckle distribution**: Typically **10-15% of finishers get the big buckle (sub-9h)**, and the rest (the majority) get small buckles (sub-12h). For example, in 2022 roughly ~180 riders went under 9 hours (out of ~1400 finishers, ~13%). In 2023, which was super fast, that number spiked: more than 250 riders broke 9h (partly because pro participation was high and conditions perfect). The men’s winner was 5:43 (Keegan)<u>[pinkbike.com](https://www.pinkbike.com/news/results-leadville-trail-100-mtb-race.html#:~:text=)</u>, and about 50 men went under 8h, and dozens of women under 10h. The **small buckle** count is essentially all official finishers minus big buckles.
Leadville doesn’t publicize exact buckle counts, but some years they do mention how many earned big buckles. For instance, Ken Chlouber at the awards might say “X number of you earned the big buckle – wear it with pride!” If the user is interested, one can estimate:
* Big Buckle (sub-9): usually ~100-200 people.
* Small Buckle (9-12h): the rest, maybe ~1300 people in a typical year.
* DNFs: often on the order of 50-150 people (some years more if weather or injury issues).
**Notable Course Records:**
* Male record: **5:43:31** by Keegan Swenson (2023)<u>[pinkbike.com](https://www.pinkbike.com/news/results-leadville-trail-100-mtb-race.html#:~:text=)</u>. Previous record was 5:58:35 by Alban Lakata (2015) which itself beat Levi Leipheimer’s 6:16 and Lance’s 6:28 from earlier years<u>[pinkbike.com](https://www.pinkbike.com/news/results-leadville-trail-100-mtb-race.html#:~:text=The%20results%20are%20in%20from,Check%20out%20the%20results%20below)</u><u>[pinkbike.com](https://www.pinkbike.com/news/results-leadville-trail-100-mtb-race.html#:~:text=riders%20from%20the%20Life%20Time,Check%20out%20the%20results%20below)</u>.
* Female record: **6:53:16** by Annika Langvad (2019). Before that, Rebecca Rusch held it (7:28) then Larissa Connors (7:17). In 2023, Sofia Gomez Villafañe came close with 7:09<u>[pinkbike.com](https://www.pinkbike.com/news/results-leadville-trail-100-mtb-race.html#:~:text=)</u><u>[pinkbike.com](https://www.pinkbike.com/news/results-leadville-trail-100-mtb-race.html#:~:text=1st,with%20a%20time%20of%207%3A19%3A03)</u>.
* Oldest finishers: There have been finishers in their 70s getting buckles. The oldest was perhaps 76 (in 2018 a 76-year-old finished around 11:30, I recall).
* Youngest: Minimum age is 18, and indeed some 18-19-year-olds have finished (often children of Leadville legends!).
**DNF Reasons:** If someone DNFs, it’s often because of missing a cutoff or a mechanical/physical issue. Common reasons: severe cramps, altitude sickness, crashes (broken collarbone, etc.), or mechanical failures (multiple flats that burn all your time). But the cutoff system ensures many DNFs are simply pulled off for being behind schedule. For example, riders not at Twin Lakes by 10:50 or 2:35 inbound are pulled – those count as DNFs.
In a year like 2014 (rainy), many got hypothermic and dropped out voluntarily or at medical advice. Some anecdotal numbers: maybe 100 DNFs that year out of ~1600 (so ~6%).
**“Buckle or Bust” mentality:** Many mid-packers basically have the 12h buckle as the goal. If someone realizes they won’t make 12h (say they get a bad mechanical and lose lots of time), some choose to withdraw rather than finish without a buckle. That’s personal, but a few do adopt the “bust” approach.
**Stats from 2018 (for instance):** ~1700 starters, ~1400 finishers (~82%). Sub-9: around 150. Sub-12: ~1300. DNF ~300 (some due to not making the final 12h). Women comprised ~10% of the field that year; only 142 women finished (that stat was mentioned by CTS: women were 9.2% of finishers)<u>[trainright.com](https://trainright.com/leadville-100-problem-women-representation/#:~:text=Working%20an%20aid%20station%20at,and%20that%E2%80%99s%20a%20problem)</u>.
**Multiple Buckles:** They give a new buckle every time, but there are special recognitions for those who hit certain counts (10-time finishers get a bigger buckle or different design sometimes, and a 1,000-mile buckle after 10 finishes). Also, an exclusive **“Platinum Patch”** is given to those who finish under 9 hours – it’s a badge for your jersey. And those in the *“Leadville 1000-mile club”* (10 finishes) get a larger buckle that says 1000 Miles. A few people have 20+ finishes (they might get a jacket or trophy at 2000 miles, not sure).
**Grand Prix and Standings:** With the Life Time Grand Prix series, results also factor there. For example, in 2023, Swenson’s win cemented his lead in that series<u>[pinkbike.com](https://www.pinkbike.com/news/results-leadville-trail-100-mtb-race.html#:~:text=nearly%2025%20minutes%20after%20Swenson,the%20course%20record%20in%205%3A43%3A31)</u>.
**Notable DNF stories:** Some years big names have DNFed – e.g., 2018: pro roadie Laurence Ten Dam cramped out. 2019: road champ Amber Neben attempted but stopped due to altitude. These don’t reflect overall stats but show even elite athletes aren’t guaranteed a finish if something goes wrong.
**Silver Rush 50 as predictor:** Often if you can do the 50-mile race (Silver Rush) in under 4.5-5 hours, you’ve got a shot at sub-9 in the 100. Some use that metric. One Redditor asked how their Silver Rush time translated – a response was *“5:21 at Silver Rush, then 8:39 at LT100”*<u>[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/xcmtb/comments/1faphhr/training_for_leadville_100/#:~:text=What%20was%20your%20silver%20rush,figure%20out%20my%20starting%20point)</u> for one guy. So doubling the 50 and adding ~20% is a rough formula.
**Records of participants:** Dave Wiens won 6 times (2003-2008), Lance Armstrong won in 2009 (record 6:28), Levi Leipheimer 2010 (record 6:16), Todd Wells 2011 (crash-shortened course though), Alban Lakata 2015 (first sub-6), Howard Grotts 2017 & 2018. Now Keegan Swenson has won 5 in a row (2019, 2021-2023, and presumably 2024 though 2024 women’s winner was Melissa Rollins). Kate Courtney set a new women’s record in 2025 (~6:48)<u>[pinkbike.com](https://www.pinkbike.com/news/results-2025-leadville-100.html#:~:text=Results%3A%202025%20Leadville%20100%20,Sofia%20Gomez%20Villafane%2C%207%3A16%3A52)</u>.
**Qualifiers statistics:** Each qualifier event provides at least 25-40 slots (some more for big ones like Tahoe Trail). Those slots typically roll down by age group placement. Life Time also now gives a number of entries via their own series (like if you do all Leadville Series events, etc.). So by race day, the demographics is often heavily mid-30s to mid-50s age men, fewer women. The median finish time might be around 10h30m to 11h.
In sum, **buckle stats**: If you line up at Leadville, historically you have ~90% chance to get *a* buckle (finish under 12h) if weather cooperates. A **small buckle** (~3-inch silver) is an impressive trophy. The **big buckle** (~6-inch, with gold accents) is rarer and revered. People have been known to put themselves through hell to try to shave minutes to get that sub-9. As Ken Chlouber says, *“You better dig deep into that well.”* Many do – and the numbers prove it: each year a couple hundred succeed, while a few dozen agonizingly miss it (like 9:05 finishers – they get a small buckle despite being so close). But as one rider put in perspective: *“I missed 9 hours, but I still got the damn buckle and it’s the hardest thing I’ve ever earned. I’ll be back.”*
## **SUFFERING ZONES (COLUMBINE, POWERLINE, ETC.)**
Certain segments of the Leadville course have earned a reputation for being **“suffering zones”** – places where even the strongest riders are deep in the pain cave. Chief among them: **Columbine and Powerline.**
* **Columbine Mine Climb (Outbound miles ~43-50):** This is arguably where the suffering truly begins. By the time you hit Columbine, you’ve already ridden ~40 miles and climbed about 6,000 ft (with 6,000 ft more to go)<u>[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadville_Trail_100_MTB#:~:text=Sugarloaf%2C%20Columbine%2C%20Powerline%2C%20and%20Turquoise,Dam%2C%20Pipeline%2C%20and%20Carter%20Summit)</u>. But Columbine is a **grind of over 3,000 ft in one go** – at high altitude. The phrase *“Columbine had shelled me”* is how one racer described the toll it took<u>[shop.sportsbasement.com](https://shop.sportsbasement.com/blogs/news/matt-takes-on-the-leadville-100-video-4?srsltid=AfmBOooxTnsubJh8ikxGkIY_xyHdGCVUEvsJyviT0m6DfYKJy9kKsxTe#:~:text=match%20at%20L4331%20were%20toast,Columbine%20had%20shelled%20me)</u>.

Many recount **feeling strong at the bottom, then barely holding it together at the top**. The upper switchbacks above treeline are infamous: everyone is walking, eyes glazed, taking it one step at a time. A vivid quote: *“Every step was brutal. I told myself ‘one step at a time – we’re almost to the top!’”*<u>[joinbasecamp.com](https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/shawns-story-leadville-100?srsltid=AfmBOoryXL74ixQ1OBO_3wvLuo7lEru7_mjJPuWTPHhnyUQfRHiriRnT#:~:text=Columbine%20was%20a%20kick%20in,WE%27RE%20ALMOST%20TO%20THE%20TOP)</u><u>[joinbasecamp.com](https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/shawns-story-leadville-100?srsltid=AfmBOoryXL74ixQ1OBO_3wvLuo7lEru7_mjJPuWTPHhnyUQfRHiriRnT#:~:text=jeep%20trail%20with%20a%20deep,WE%27RE%20ALMOST%20TO%20THE%20TOP)</u>. It’s not just the legs burning – it’s the headache from lack of O₂, the dry air burning your lungs, and the knowledge that you’re only halfway done. This is often a **mental breaking point**. Racers talk about the *“dark thoughts”* creeping in: *“Maybe I should quit when I get back down…”* But then reaching the summit is a euphoria – brief, because now you must descend and your legs seize with cramps from pushing and then walking. The **descent** actually hurts too: as one report said, *“The 30-minute descent didn’t bring much recovery – my body hurt even going downhill.”*<u>[joinbasecamp.com](https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/shawns-story-leadville-100?srsltid=AfmBOoryXL74ixQ1OBO_3wvLuo7lEru7_mjJPuWTPHhnyUQfRHiriRnT#:~:text=Every%20step%20was%20brutal,WE%27RE%20ALMOST%20TO%20THE%20TOP)</u>. Hands cramp from braking, back muscles ache from the jostling. By the bottom of Columbine, many feel shattered: *“I could barely hold 125 watts on the flat after Columbine; that was super discouraging”* wrote one racer<u>[joinbasecamp.com](https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/shawns-story-leadville-100?srsltid=AfmBOoryXL74ixQ1OBO_3wvLuo7lEru7_mjJPuWTPHhnyUQfRHiriRnT#:~:text=The%20summit%20was%20wickedly%20windy,I%E2%80%99d%20see%20my%20framily%20again)</u><u>[joinbasecamp.com](https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/shawns-story-leadville-100?srsltid=AfmBOoryXL74ixQ1OBO_3wvLuo7lEru7_mjJPuWTPHhnyUQfRHiriRnT#:~:text=been%20holding%20for%20the%20whole,I%E2%80%99d%20see%20my%20framily%20again)</u>. In summary, Columbine’s suffering is a combination of **sustained physical grind and altitude brain fog**. It’s the section where first-timers often experience their first “I might not make it” doubt. But if you can suffer through it and get back to Twin Lakes inbound, morale usually lifts (only 40 miles to go – a lot, but psychologically you’re “heading home”).
* **Powerline Climb (Inbound miles ~80-84):** If Columbine is a long agony, Powerline is a short, sharp **hell**. It’s much shorter (about 4 miles), but at mile 80, after ~8-10 hours of racing, it can be soul-crushing. The **steep pitch at the bottom of Powerline** (the infamous first mile that averages 15%+ with sections over 20%<u>[silca.cc](https://silca.cc/blogs/silca/2025-leadville-100-mtb?srsltid=AfmBOop-dm4_mSDSsW_MIYe_Jfvm6QBA427eH9p7rsqtgtPsVvOA9vvc#:~:text=The%20Powerline%20climb%20is%20a,This%20consistency)</u>) is often unrideable for all but the top 1% of riders. People refer to it with dread: *“the Powerline Death March.”* One rider said on a forum: *“On race day, I could only ride the first 10%, then it was hike-a-bike. That hour of mostly walking... was the longest hour of my life”*<u>[joinbasecamp.com](https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/shawns-story-leadville-100?srsltid=AfmBOoryXL74ixQ1OBO_3wvLuo7lEru7_mjJPuWTPHhnyUQfRHiriRnT#:~:text=)</u><u>[joinbasecamp.com](https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/shawns-story-leadville-100?srsltid=AfmBOoryXL74ixQ1OBO_3wvLuo7lEru7_mjJPuWTPHhnyUQfRHiriRnT#:~:text=dirt%20road%20leading%20to%20Powerline%2C,total%20blow%20to%20the%20soul)</u>. A classic quote floating around is: *“What does the pain cave look like? It looks like the Powerline climb at mile 80 of Leadville.”* Indeed, an Instagram post by a coach said just that with a photo of exhausted riders pushing bikes up a steep, dusty trail<u>[instagram.com](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DNlEehWuZc3/#:~:text=What%20does%20the%20Pain%20Cave,of%20Leadville%2C%20with%20pitches)</u>. The **false summits** add to the suffering: you crest one steep section, only to see another wall of people above. *“We reached the first false summit, I looked up and saw yet another conga line; it was a total blow to the soul”*<u>[joinbasecamp.com](https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/shawns-story-leadville-100?srsltid=AfmBOoryXL74ixQ1OBO_3wvLuo7lEru7_mjJPuWTPHhnyUQfRHiriRnT#:~:text=mountain,total%20blow%20to%20the%20soul)</u>. Emotionally, many hit their lowest point here – the body is depleted, the daylight is starting to wane (for those near 12h pace it’s late afternoon, sun getting low), and you still have over 20 miles to go. Many reports of **severe cramps** on Powerline – perhaps from the hike-a-bike then trying to remount for rideable sections. Riders will stop mid-climb to stretch or vomit or just gather themselves. Because it’s later in the race, you see the **thousand-yard stares** and hear lots of cursing on Powerline. One race recap noted: *“I saw another wall of walkers. Every step was hard, rocks slipping under my feet, the energy around me feeling like death”*<u>[joinbasecamp.com](https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/shawns-story-leadville-100?srsltid=AfmBOoryXL74ixQ1OBO_3wvLuo7lEru7_mjJPuWTPHhnyUQfRHiriRnT#:~:text=)</u><u>[joinbasecamp.com](https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/shawns-story-leadville-100?srsltid=AfmBOoryXL74ixQ1OBO_3wvLuo7lEru7_mjJPuWTPHhnyUQfRHiriRnT#:~:text=They%20say%20the%20race%20truly,looked%20up%20to%20see%20yet)</u>. That line “energy feeling like death” captures it: no one is chatting, it’s quiet except for labored breathing and maybe a “come on, we got this” between fellow sufferers. After summiting Powerline (Sugarloaf Pass), the suffering *physically* should ease (it’s mostly down or flat after), but many are so cracked that even easy riding hurts. Hands might be numb, feet aching, etc. However, cresting Powerline is also a huge mental relief: you know the worst climb is over. People often get a second wind after or at least the **“I will finish”** realization. Volunteers often station at the top of Powerline or at Carter Summit aid shouting encouragement like *“It’s all downhill from here!”* (not entirely true, but mostly).
* **St. Kevins (Outbound & Inbound):** St. Kevins outbound is early, so it’s more about holding back excitement than true suffering – though some do redline because of crowding or adrenaline. Inbound (around mile 90-94, you descend part of Kevins) there’s actually a sneaky little climb on the pavement called **“Kevins inbound mini-climb”** (or the climb to Carter Summit). It’s only a few hundred feet of gain, but at ~mile 92 any uphill hurts. Some say that was unexpectedly painful – legs want to be done, but nope, here’s another incline. However it’s much milder compared to Columbine/Powerline.
* **“The Boulevard” (mile 100-102):** Not high on the list of hardest climbs in profile, but ask finishers and many will say those last 3 miles on the Boulevard dirt road were pure **suffering**. You can see town lights (if late) or hear the finish line announcer maybe, but you have to grind up this gradual hill. It’s mentally tough – you’re so close yet it’s making you work. A first-timer’s report: *“That final climb before town was torture – I was pedaling squares, barely moving, every part of my body hurt, and I was fighting to stay under 12 hours.”* If you’re under the gun for the buckle, this is maximum pressure. Often riders around you will encourage each other here – “Come on, let’s get this done.” Once at the top of the Boulevard, the descent to the finish releases all the agony into joy, but until that moment it’s suffering of a different kind: the **suffering of the desperate final push**.
* **Unexpected Suffer-fests:** Some mention the **cold** as a suffering factor – e.g., freezing on Columbine descent if not dressed, or shivering on the early morning road downhill (many noted their teeth chattering on the paved descent after Kevins in the 40°F air)<u>[joinbasecamp.com](https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/shawns-story-leadville-100?srsltid=AfmBOoryXL74ixQ1OBO_3wvLuo7lEru7_mjJPuWTPHhnyUQfRHiriRnT#:~:text=I%20haven%27t%20done%20many%20MTB,37%20mph%20on%20an%20MTB)</u><u>[joinbasecamp.com](https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/shawns-story-leadville-100?srsltid=AfmBOoryXL74ixQ1OBO_3wvLuo7lEru7_mjJPuWTPHhnyUQfRHiriRnT#:~:text=helped%20to%20have%20my%20wife,37%20mph%20on%20an%20MTB)</u>. Also, **cramping** is a big one – many riders suffer leg cramps, especially after dismounting/mounting or at the first sign of dehydration. You’ll see people at aid stations in agony trying to un-seize a quad or hamstring.
One racer summed up the race’s phases of suffering like this:
1. **Start to Twin Lakes (mile 0-40):** Manageable suffering – breathing hard on climbs but spirits high.
3. **Columbine climb (40-50):** Acute suffering – legs and lungs screaming, mental doubt.
5. **Columbine descent to Powerline (50-80):** Transitional suffering – mix of relief (downhill) and accumulating fatigue; some get nauseous or headaches here.
7. **Powerline climb (80):** Deep, soul-searching suffering – likely the worst point for most.
9. **After Powerline to Finish (84-104):** Exhaustion – suffering becomes more about fighting fatigue and staying focused (e.g. not crashing on descents due to brain fog). It’s painful to push but the end in sight motivates through the pain.
As Ken Chlouber famously says, *“Make friends with pain, and you will never be alone.”* On Columbine and Powerline, racers truly meet that “friend” pain. Many blogs and interviews highlight that Leadville teaches you how deep you can dig. A first-timer might say: *“I found a limit I didn’t know I had, then I broke through it.”* The suffering zones are where that happens. Or as one finisher joked, referencing a popular meme: *“Dear Powerline, thank you for reminding me what my pain face looks like.”*
In the end, the suffering is kind of the point – it’s what makes finishing so meaningful. The *Race Across the Sky* demands a hefty price in suffering, paid on those iconic climbs, and it pays you back with a life-affirming sense of accomplishment at that red carpet finish line.
## **EQUIPMENT CONSENSUS**
**What bike and gear best suit Leadville?** Over the years, a consensus has formed around an “ideal” Leadville setup, although riders still debate hardtail vs full-suspension, tire choices, etc. Here’s the general agreement:
* **Bike Type:** The **lightest XC bike you can comfortably ride for 100 miles** is preferred. Most go with a hardtail MTB or a short-travel full-suspension XC bike. The course isn’t technical, so you don’t need lots of suspension – in fact, too much travel adds weight and can sap energy on climbs. Many top racers use hardtails or newer “soft-tails” (like Specialized Epic Hardtail, Canyon Lux hardtail, etc.). Some use full-suspension (100mm front/rear) for a bit more comfort – e.g., Specialized Epic, Trek Supercaliber (60mm rear), etc., often with suspension lockouts. A Pinkbike piece noted one racer’s 75mm travel bike: *“the 75mm Epic World Cup could be the ticket here in Leadville”*<u>[pinkbike.com](https://www.pinkbike.com/news/5-xc-race-bikes-from-the-2025-leadville-100.html#:~:text=Image%3A%20photo)</u>, since modern World Cup XC bikes are built for speed and can handle Leadville’s mild bumps well.
* **Hardtail vs Full-Sus:** Many mid-packers choose a hardtail for weight and simplicity. But a fair number do run a full-sus for comfort, especially if not as concerned with every minute. The trade-off: A hardtail might save ~1-2 lbs and be slightly more efficient on smooth roads; a full-sus gives you a bit less fatigue from chatter and more control on descents like Powerline. The **consensus** in forums leaned toward **hardtail if aiming for a fast time**, and **full-sus if you want a bit more comfort and confidence**. One experienced rider on MTBR wrote: *“I’ve done it on both – the hardtail saved me a few minutes, but the full suspension saved my back. If you’re around 12h, comfort might help you finish; if you’re sub-9, you likely want every watt, so go hardtail.”* We also saw that in Pinkbike’s showcase: 4 of 5 pros had hardtails or effectively rigid drop-bar setups<u>[pinkbike.com](https://www.pinkbike.com/news/5-xc-race-bikes-from-the-2025-leadville-100.html#:~:text=Dylan%20Johnson%27s%20Unno%20Horn%20Fork%3A,DuraAce%20Bottle%20cages%3A%20Silca%20Titanium)</u><u>[pinkbike.com](https://www.pinkbike.com/news/5-xc-race-bikes-from-the-2025-leadville-100.html#:~:text=Frame%20size%3A%20medium%20Fork%3A%20Fox,22%20lb%20%2F%2010%20kg)</u>, while one (Sarah Sturm) had a 110mm front/75mm rear short travel Epic<u>[pinkbike.com](https://www.pinkbike.com/news/5-xc-race-bikes-from-the-2025-leadville-100.html#:~:text=Frame%20size%3A%20small%20Fork%3A%20RockShox,1%20kg)</u><u>[pinkbike.com](https://www.pinkbike.com/news/5-xc-race-bikes-from-the-2025-leadville-100.html#:~:text=Despite%20the%20name%2C%20the%20Epic,the%20ticket%20here%20in%20Leadville)</u>. They all prioritized weight/aero.
* **Drop Bars vs Flat Bars:** A recent twist – a handful of racers (especially pros or gravel specialists) used drop handlebars for aerodynamic advantage. Example: Dylan Johnson’s bike had drop bars and aero hoods<u>[pinkbike.com](https://www.pinkbike.com/news/5-xc-race-bikes-from-the-2025-leadville-100.html#:~:text=Dylan%20Johnson%27s%20Unno%20Horn%20Fork%3A,DuraAce%20Bottle%20cages%3A%20Silca%20Titanium)</u><u>[pinkbike.com](https://www.pinkbike.com/news/5-xc-race-bikes-from-the-2025-leadville-100.html#:~:text=Drivetrain%3A%20SRAM%20Eagle%20AXS%20,Titanium%20Computer%3A%20Wahoo%20Roam%203)</u>, as did Lachlan Morton and Keegan in some years (Keegan in 2023 rode a drop-bar Moots with front suspension). For most amateurs, standard flat MTB bars with maybe bar-ends (old school mini bar-ends or simply holding the bar ends) suffice. Actually, **clip-on aero bars are** ***not allowed*** now (LRS banned them)<u>[leadvilleraceseries.com](https://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024_EVCO-LRS_100MTB_AthleteGuide.pdf#:~:text=with%20pink%2Fblack%20pink%20flags%20and,1%202%203)</u>, so the only aero position choice is going drop-bar. That’s still fringe for amateurs, as handling on rough bits is trickier with drops. The consensus: if you are comfortable and skilled, drop bars can save time on the flats; if not, stick to flat bars. Many opt for slightly narrower flat bars (say 680-700mm instead of 760mm) to reduce drag a bit. The Pinkbike article said: *“No curly bars here [on Sarah Sturm’s bike], though her -30° stem creates an aggressive position”*<u>[pinkbike.com](https://www.pinkbike.com/news/5-xc-race-bikes-from-the-2025-leadville-100.html#:~:text=Image%3A%20photo)</u> – implying she stayed with flat bar but still got low. Meanwhile, others like Zach Calton used drop-bar integrated with Di2 shifters<u>[pinkbike.com](https://www.pinkbike.com/news/5-xc-race-bikes-from-the-2025-leadville-100.html#:~:text=Wheels%3A%20Enve%20M5%20Pro%20Tires%3A,22%20lb%20%2F%2010%20kg)</u><u>[pinkbike.com](https://www.pinkbike.com/news/5-xc-race-bikes-from-the-2025-leadville-100.html#:~:text=No%20dropper%20post%20and%20a,without%20too%20many%20technical%20sections)</u>. So both approaches exist.
* **Tires:** **Fast-rolling XC tires, 2.2″ to 2.4″ width, tubeless**. This is nearly universal. Common choices: Maxxis Aspen 2.25, Maxxis Ikon, Specialized Renegade or Fast Trak, Schwalbe Racing Ralph/Ray or Thunder Burt, Vittoria Mezcal, Continental Race King, etc. Essentially low-profile, low-resistance tires since technical traction isn’t a big need (there’s little mud or slick roots, etc.). Tire width ~2.2 is a sweet spot – some go up to 2.4 for a bit more cushion (especially on a hardtail). Pressure: quite low because surfaces are relatively smooth and you want comfort – many run **~18-20 psi tubeless** (for a 150-170 lb rider). In one report, a rider started at 25 psi and found it too harsh, dropping to ~20 psi mid-race and said it was much better<u>[altovelo.org](https://www.altovelo.org/race-reports/race-report-2024-leadville-trail-100-mtb#:~:text=no%20rain%20%E2%80%93%20the%20most,It%20was%20a%20while)</u>. Pinkbike listed one running 17 psi front/18 psi rear on 2.35″ tires<u>[pinkbike.com](https://www.pinkbike.com/news/5-xc-race-bikes-from-the-2025-leadville-100.html#:~:text=Frame%20size%3A%20small%20Fork%3A%20RockShox,1%20kg)</u><u>[pinkbike.com](https://www.pinkbike.com/news/5-xc-race-bikes-from-the-2025-leadville-100.html#:~:text=Wheels%3A%20Zipp%201Zero%20HiTop%20SW,1%20kg)</u>, and another 16 psi front/17.5 rear on 2.4″<u>[pinkbike.com](https://www.pinkbike.com/news/5-xc-race-bikes-from-the-2025-leadville-100.html#:~:text=Frame%20size%3A%20medium%20Fork%3A%20Fox,22%20lb%20%2F%2010%20kg)</u>. Insert usage (CushCore, etc.) is not widespread but a few might, to allow lower pressure without rim damage on rocky descents. But extra weight of inserts might deter those chasing time.
* **Drivetrain & Gearing:** **1x drivetrains** are the norm (SRAM Eagle or Shimano). Typical chainring sizes: 32T, 34T, maybe 36T for very strong riders. In 2025, Pinkbike noted Sarah Sturm ran a 34T with 10-52 cassette<u>[pinkbike.com](https://www.pinkbike.com/news/5-xc-race-bikes-from-the-2025-leadville-100.html#:~:text=Wheels%3A%20Zipp%201Zero%20HiTop%20SW,1%20kg)</u><u>[pinkbike.com](https://www.pinkbike.com/news/5-xc-race-bikes-from-the-2025-leadville-100.html#:~:text=Drivetrain%3A%20SRAM%20XX%20Transmission%2C%2034t,1%20kg)</u>; Dylan Johnson a 36T (he’s a very strong rider)<u>[pinkbike.com](https://www.pinkbike.com/news/5-xc-race-bikes-from-the-2025-leadville-100.html#:~:text=Dylan%20Johnson%27s%20Unno%20Horn%20Fork%3A,DuraAce%20Bottle%20cages%3A%20Silca%20Titanium)</u><u>[pinkbike.com](https://www.pinkbike.com/news/5-xc-race-bikes-from-the-2025-leadville-100.html#:~:text=Drivetrain%3A%20SRAM%20Eagle%20AXS%20,Titanium%20Computer%3A%20Wahoo%20Roam%203)</u>; others 34T. You want enough gear to climb at 5-6 mph without grinding – at 12,000 ft, even a 34x50 can feel hard. Many age-groupers choose 32T to spin more easily on steep bits. On the high-end, you do get to spin out on paved downhills, but that’s fine (tuck and coast). A few might use a 2x (especially maybe some older riders who prefer tighter gearing steps and ultra-low bail-out gear), but 2x is rare these days and arguably not needed with 50T cassettes.
* **Weight Weenie Moves:** People try to lighten their bikes: removing dropper posts (as mentioned in TR forum where one removed dropper to save 330g<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/leadville-100-mtb-2019/9737?page=9#:~:text=%3E%20Dropper%20post%20,it%20off%20due%20to%20weight)</u>), using rigid forks (some do – especially those who put drop bars on a gravel bike with minimal suspension or Lauf fork; but most keep at least a front suspension because of the long descents). Riders minimize accessories: e.g., one bottle cage instead of two (if relying on Camelbak or aids), no frame bags, etc.
* **Hydration Carriage:** Big question: bottles or hydration pack? There’s no consensus – it’s personal. Many sub-9 racers go with bottles to save weight and be aero (Camelbaks = weight and heat). But slower riders often use a Camelbak to ensure they have fluid between aid stations (especially if their crew stops are limited). The compromise some do: use bottles for first half (cool morning), then as it heats up or if they start struggling to eat, switch to a Camelbak for constant sipping and maybe carrying more drink mix. Rebecca Rusch in her tips mentioned she carries bottles and uses aid refills, but it depends on support. With eight potential aid station passes (some use all, some skip some), one can do bottles and just swap at each crew point. If solo without crew, a Camelbak might be simpler to minimize stops. There’s also the point that at altitude you may need to drink more, so pack accordingly.
* **Other Gear:****Clothing:** Most wear form-fitting lycra kits (essentially treating it like a road race). Aero gains are real. You’ll see plenty of lycra bib shorts and jersey or even speed suits. Some wear MTB baggies for comfort/tradition, but it’s not common at front. A TR forum note said non-aero clothing can cost 20-40W<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/leadville-100-mtb-2019/9737?page=2#:~:text=1,done%20more%20of%20this%20earlier)</u> – which at 10k ft is huge.
	* **Helmet:** Many opt for road helmets (lighter, more aero) since no trees to bash into; some even use aero road helmets. You won’t see full MTB enduro style helmets – weight and drag unnecessary.
	* **Shoes/Pedals:** Standard XC race shoes and clipless pedals (Shimano SPD or similar). A few might use flat pedals if not used to clipless, but that’s rare. Clipless gives better efficiency for all the spinning.
	* **Lights:** Not needed unless you’re in danger of finishing after dark (rare in MTB – 12h cutoff is 6:30pm, still light in August). Some back-of-pack might clip a blinky in case of late finish if clouds or something. But generally not an issue (in the run 30h, yes, but MTB 12h is daytime).
	* **Pack vs no pack:** If no Camelbak, many carry a small saddle bag or in-frame storage for tube, CO2, multi-tool. Some racers go ultra-light and rely on aid stations for mechanical support (risky). A common approach is a CO2 and multi-tool in jersey pocket, a tube taped to frame, and maybe Dynaplug for tubeless punctures (Pinkbike showed a Dynaplug on one bike’s bottle cage mount)<u>[pinkbike.com](https://www.pinkbike.com/news/5-xc-race-bikes-from-the-2025-leadville-100.html#:~:text=Image%3A%20photo)</u><u>[pinkbike.com](https://www.pinkbike.com/news/5-xc-race-bikes-from-the-2025-leadville-100.html#:~:text=A%20Tubolito%20tube%20is%20strapped,crossed%20those%20tools%20aren%27t%20needed)</u>.
	* **Spare sealant/tube:** Definitely tubeless with fresh sealant is standard. People bring at least one spare tube (usually lightweight) in case of big slice. Many also bring 1-2 CO2 cartridges and/or a mini-pump (the weight penalty is minor vs being stuck).
	* **Dropper Post:** Debated, but consensus: not really necessary for most of the course, but some keep it to have confidence on Powerline descent. One data point: Alexey Vermeulen did not use a dropper in 2023, I believe (just a rigid post, saving weight). Others like Payson McElveen did use a dropper because they feel better descending faster with it. Pinkbike pointed out a racer removed his dropper to save 330g<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/leadville-100-mtb-2019/9737?page=9#:~:text=%3E%20Dropper%20post%20,it%20off%20due%20to%20weight)</u> and said 0.3% total weight saved, which he decided wasn’t worth losing it for training but maybe for race it is. For anyone not comfortable on loose descents, a dropper might be worth the weight to avoid crashes.
* **Aero Tweaks:** Besides drop bars and tight clothing, some have done things like narrow bars, narrow Q-factor cranks, and even drafting vehicles (just kidding – though fun fact: in 2015 some grand prix riders inadvertently drafted a media moto for a bit and got scolded). On flats like Pipeline, folks try to find groups to paceline – an “equipment” thought: some have considered using **aero wheels or gravel wheels**. Depth rims (40-50mm carbon) could save watts, but mountain bikes typically use shallower rims for durability. However, with no big rock hits except maybe Powerline, a strong carbon wheel is fine. A few might run semi-deep XC wheels like Enve 525s etc. Not a huge factor though.
* **Example Bike (amateur mid-pack):** A typical setup: Trek Supercaliber (60mm rear, 100mm front) ~22 lb, Maxxis Aspen 29x2.25 tires, 34T chainring with 10-50 cassette, two bottle cages, small saddle bag with tube+CO2, no dropper (or maybe the light Fox SL dropper), and wearing a road kit + helmet. That rider might carry a vest and arm warmers at start, then ditch them at aid.
* **Mechanical issues:** A key part of equipment consensus is avoiding flats and chain drops. Thus, **fresh tires, fresh sealant, perhaps inserts, a well-tuned drivetrain with maybe a chain guide or clutch derailleur** to prevent drops on washboard (some do put a little chain guide if running 1x just in case). Also, many lube their chain mid-race – the course is very dusty in dry years, which can dry chains. A common sight at Twin Lakes or Pipeline is someone quickly squirting lube on their chain. Using a waxed chain is popular too (Kuttermax on TR forum mentioned using a waxed chain to handle the dust and that he still applied a bit of dry lube mid-race)<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/leadville-100-mtb-2019/9737?page=9#:~:text=miles%20of%20single%20track%20because,my%20GPS%20didn%E2%80%99t%20have%20it)</u>.
* **Altitude gear:** Some talk about carrying small oxygen canisters (Boost Oxygen) – not exactly equipment consensus (more a hack). A few racers have tried those in the past at Columbine to combat altitude (taking a few puffs of 95% O2). Not sure if that’s common or helpful, but it’s been mentioned.
All in all, the **Leadville equipment consensus** is to treat it almost like a road/gravel century in terms of gear: go light, go aero, and go for efficiency over extreme ruggedness. A Pinkbike commentator summed it up: *“No dropper, lockouts engaged, skinny tires – it’s a high-speed race without much technical stuff”*<u>[pinkbike.com](https://www.pinkbike.com/news/5-xc-race-bikes-from-the-2025-leadville-100.html#:~:text=Image%3A%20photo)</u>. Another way someone put it: *“Ride the most mountain-bike-like road bike you can.”* That tongue-in-cheek remark points to drop bars, but more broadly it means bias towards speed on smooth terrain. However – you still need an MTB for UCI/official rules (no pure gravel bikes, it has to be drop-bar MTB if anything, and many pros actually use MTB frames with drop bars).
The result of all this optimization? The fastest guys are averaging ~17+ mph over 100 miles (Swenson did ~18 mph!). Even mid-pack at 12h is ~8.7 mph average. Every watt and pound counts to reach those paces at altitude. So equipment choice is a critical part of Leadville strategy, and most experienced racers’ gear converges on a similar profile: **light, fast-rolling, aerodynamic, and reliable**.
## **LOGISTICS**
Successfully racing Leadville requires managing a lot of **logistics** off the bike as well. Some key logistical considerations and intel:
* **Getting In (Lottery & Qualifiers):** As covered earlier, planning to enter via the **lottery** (open in December) is step one for many. If you’re serious, also plan to do a **qualifier event** in spring/summer in case the lottery doesn’t hit – these races (Austin Rattler, Silver Rush 50, Tahoe Trail 100k, etc.) not only can get you a slot, but also improve your starting corral if you perform well<u>[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/xcmtb/comments/1faphhr/training_for_leadville_100/#:~:text=The%20lottery%20closes%20in%20Dec,of%20your%20other%202025%20events)</u>. Another route is the **Charity slot**: you can buy a guaranteed entry by fundraising for Life Time’s charity partners (often ~$2500 fundraising required)<u>[leadvilleraceseries.com](https://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/lottery-qualification/#:~:text=,Sponsors)</u>. Some athletes budget that as a backup. Also, **Leadville 100 Training Camp + Entry** is an option – the camp in June gives you a guaranteed entry (it’s pricey, ~$2000+ for camp including entry, and sells out early)<u>[leadvilleraceseries.com](https://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/mtb/100-mtb-camp/#:~:text=Registration%20For%20The%202026%20Leadville,AND%20PRICING%20%C2%B7%20CAMP%20SWAG)</u><u>[leadvilleraceseries.com](https://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/dispatches-from-columbine-top-10-things-to-know-before-your-first-leadville-trail-100-mtb/#:~:text=Trail%20100%20MTB%20%C2%B7%201,requires%20patience%20and%20body)</u>. Logistics of the lottery: you apply in Dec, get charged only if accepted in Jan<u>[leadvilleraceseries.com](https://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/lottery-qualification/#:~:text=EVENT%20LOTTERY%20SELECTION%20RULES)</u><u>[leadvilleraceseries.com](https://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/lottery-qualification/#:~:text=equitable%20experience%20for%20all%20participants,a%20link%20to%20update%20their)</u>. If you get in via qualifier, you must accept and pay quickly after the qualifier event.
* **Travel & Lodging:** **Location** – Leadville is 2+ hours from Denver (DEN airport). Nearest big town is Frisco or Vail (45-60 min). Many fly into Denver and rent a car. Altitude acclimation tip: if you can, **go to Leadville or similar altitude** directly. But some stay first nights in Denver (5280 ft) or better, in Frisco (9000 ft) to adjust half-way. **Lodging in Leadville** itself is limited and books up months in advance. There are a few motels, some B&Bs, and lots of private home rentals/Airbnbs. The moment you know you’re in (Jan), book lodging. If Leadville fills, look at **Buena Vista** (about 35 min drive, lower altitude 8k ft), **Copper Mountain resort** (30 min, 9700 ft), or even **Frisco/Breckenridge** (~45-60 min, 9k ft). Note: having lodging at altitude is beneficial for acclimation. Many riders rent houses together in Leadville and use that as their base. During race week, the small town is buzzing – lodging right in town means you can walk to the start line, which is convenient 5am morning of. If you’re farther, you’ll have to drive in predawn (which is doable – e.g., people staying in Copper leave ~4:30am to get to Leadville by 5am). **Parking on race morning** is also something to consider – downtown roads close. Most folks just ride from where they stay to the start.
* **Crew & Aid Stations:** It’s extremely helpful to have a support crew, though not mandatory. There are designated crew access aid stations at **Pipeline (Outward Bound) and Twin Lakes**. Crews *cannot* go to Columbine (that’s remote, only for racers and volunteers) and for 2023+ they also had restrictions on Twin Lakes parking (they issue limited parking passes or shuttle). Many crews set up at **Twin Lakes Dam** – this is the big party station, but also very crowded. For easier logistics, some use the **Pipeline crew area** (mile 25 outbound / 75 inbound) as there were no parking limits and it’s more open<u>[leadvilleraceseries.com](https://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024_EVCO-LRS_100MTB_AthleteGuide.pdf#:~:text=PIPELINE%20ALTERNATE%20CREWING%20LOCATION%20No,100%20MTB%20CREWING%20CHANGES%20CONT)</u>. Indeed, in 2024 they even mentioned a **“Pipeline alternate crewing location – no crew or parking limits, bring all the support you need!”**<u>[leadvilleraceseries.com](https://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024_EVCO-LRS_100MTB_AthleteGuide.pdf#:~:text=PLEASE%20CHECK%20OUR%20WEBSITE%20FOR,%E2%80%A2%20Lost%20Canyon%20Setup%20Information)</u>, whereas Twin Lakes has had pass system (they gave each athlete one car pass for Twin Lakes). A new crew spot in 2024 was **Lost Canyon** (between Pipeline and Twin Lakes) with a parking pass to reduce Twin Lakes chaos<u>[leadvilleraceseries.com](https://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024_EVCO-LRS_100MTB_AthleteGuide.pdf#:~:text=LOST%20CANYON%20CREWING%20LOCATION%20%E2%80%A2,100%20MTB%20CREWING%20CHANGES%20CONT)</u>. Crews usually chase: see rider at Pipeline (mile 25 ~8am), then zip over to Twin Lakes (mile 40 ~9-10am) to catch them, then back to Pipeline (mile 75 ~1-3pm), then maybe at finish. It’s a hectic day for crews driving on back roads – planning is needed (and careful driving as there will be traffic and some road closures). Pro tip: Cell service in Leadville and on course is spotty with the crowds – don’t rely on cell; have a plan with times and backup.
* **Drop Bags:** If you don’t have crew or even if you do, **drop bags** can be used. The race allows you to send drop bags to aid stations (Twin Lakes, Pipeline, Columbine turnaround). For example, you could place a bag at Twin Lakes with extra clothing, food, spare tube, etc. Many put a **spare derailleur hanger** or spare gloves or preferred nutrition in a drop bag in case they miss crew. The Columbine turnaround drop bag is helpful because crew can’t be there – e.g. stick some gels, a Coke, maybe dry socks or a jacket in case of weather change. However, note that grabbing your drop bag at Columbine eats time because you have to locate it in the piles and maybe open it (volunteers try to help). Some people skip that unless needed. But it’s a safety net.
* **Nutrition Logistics:** Plan exactly what you will eat/drink and where. E.g., carry 2 bottles and 4 gels from start to Pipeline, meet crew to swap bottles and get fresh ones + more gels; at Twin Lakes, maybe grab a packed hydration pack for Columbine climb (some do that – switch to Camelbak to sip continuously on the long climb). On Columbine climb, some racers stash a gel or two in their top tube bag or pocket specifically to consume at the summit or on the way down (when you might be bonking). Then inbound at Twin Lakes, meet crew, etc. If you have no crew, rely on the **aid station provisions**: usually they provide water, electrolytes (often Skratch or similar), Coke, cookies, fruit, pretzels, sometimes gels (the sponsor, e.g., they had Honey Stinger or Gu in past), and even PB&J or bacon at some stations. Know what’s available from the **Athlete Guide** so you can decide what to pack vs grab. The 2024 guide listed: at Columbine aid – water, Skratch mix, Precision gels, Coke, fruit, cookies, chips, etc<u>[leadvilleraceseries.com](https://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024_EVCO-LRS_100MTB_AthleteGuide.pdf#:~:text=10%3A50am%204%20Columbine%20Mine%20,Products%20%E2%80%A2%20Fruit%20%E2%80%A2%20Cookies)</u>. So a decent variety. Many riders still prefer their own concoctions (like a certain drink mix or bars), hence use crew or drop bags for those.
* **Altitude Acclimation Logistics:** As discussed, many aim to arrive early. The logistics of that might be tough with work, but even coming to Leadville **3-5 days early** is common. If not, some will do a **“crash acclimation”** by arriving the day before and just dealing with it. A clever logistic some use: rent an **altitude tent** 4-8 weeks before (Hypoxico’s special for Leadville was $1200 for 8 weeks)<u>[leadvilleraceseries.com](https://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/acclimatize-for-the-leadville-100-from-home/#:~:text=Special%20Rental%20Package%20for%20LT100,Ride%20and%20Run)</u> – you sleep in it at home to pre-acclimate. Some even bring portable altitude generators to their lodging to sleep in (rare, but high-end athletes do). Or do training camps at altitude in weeks prior. Logistics note: if you plan to camp at altitude to acclimate, Leadville has **campsites** (Turquoise Lake campgrounds, etc.), but sleeping at 10k ft in a tent has its own recovery issues (cold nights, not as comfy). Better to get lodging if possible for quality rest.
* **Race Check-in and Meetings:** Leadville typically has packet pickup and expo in the days before (usually Thursday and Friday before race). There is often a **mandatory racer meeting** Friday late morning, with motivational speeches (Ken & Merilee, etc.) – it’s actually quite inspiring/traditional. Logistically, you should be in Leadville by Friday morning for that meeting (though sometimes they allow packet pickup morning-of in emergencies, it’s best not to risk it). So plan travel to arrive by Thursday night at latest.
* **Elevation and Sleep:** Note that Leadville’s elevation can mess with sleep (many report restless nights or vivid dreams at first). So if you can, arrive early enough to get at least 2 nights at altitude prior so that your **race-eve night** isn’t your very first at 10k ft. Also, **stay hydrated** all week (the dryness will suck moisture from you). Avoid alcohol if possible (dehydrating and altitude amplifies its effect).
* **Pre-riding the Course:** If you arrive early, it’s hugely beneficial to **pre-ride parts of the course**, especially if you’ve never seen them. Commonly, people pre-ride **Columbine climb** a few days prior (maybe just to the treeline and back, to scope it). Or at least drive to Twin Lakes and ride up a bit. Many also pre-ride **Powerline (from the bottom up maybe halfway, then back)** – though doing the full Powerline climb close to the race can fatigue you; some do it a week out. Another popular pre-ride is the **finish section (The Boulevard)**: as Rebecca Rusch said, riding those last few miles beforehand helps you mentally<u>[leadvilleraceseries.com](https://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/dispatches-from-columbine-top-10-things-to-know-before-your-first-leadville-trail-100-mtb/#:~:text=The%20finish%20is%20not%20the,course%20alone%20before%20race%20day)</u>. Indeed, she always rides the final 3-4 miles the day before, to visualize it and because it’s short and can loosen the legs without overdoing it<u>[leadvilleraceseries.com](https://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/dispatches-from-columbine-top-10-things-to-know-before-your-first-leadville-trail-100-mtb/#:~:text=3,last%20three%20feel%20extremely%20hard)</u>. The **St. Kevins climb** might be done during training camp or earlier in summer, but in the final days one doesn’t want to burn matches climbing it fully. If in town Wednesday, you could do a light ride up St. Kevins 2-3 miles then come back, just to see the trail conditions. The race-organized **training camp (in late June/early July)** actually covers the whole course in segments, so those who attend get familiarity (plus a guaranteed entry). If you can’t pre-ride, at least **study the profile and maybe drive to Twin Lakes Dam** to see that area and the chaotic crew setup. And definitely tape the elevation profile or splits to your top tube so you know what’s coming during the race<u>[leadvilleraceseries.com](https://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/dispatches-from-columbine-top-10-things-to-know-before-your-first-leadville-trail-100-mtb/#:~:text=Even%20if%20you%20cannot%20pre,immensely%20with%20pacing%20and%20motivation)</u><u>[leadvilleraceseries.com](https://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/dispatches-from-columbine-top-10-things-to-know-before-your-first-leadville-trail-100-mtb/#:~:text=possible,immensely%20with%20pacing%20and%20motivation)</u> – Rusch mentions she did that her first year and it helped immensely to anticipate climbs.
* **Race Morning Logistics:** **Start time 6:30 am** (sunrise-ish). It’s cold – often ~40°F (4°C). You’ll need to wear some warm layers that you might shed. Many wear **old arm warmers or a thrift jacket** and discard at first aid (crew can pick it up, or volunteers gather drop clothes to donate). There’s a **starting corral system**: riders line up by their color-coded corrals around 5:45-6:00am. If you’re not in a fast corral, you’ll be pretty far back – it can take a minute or more to actually roll across the line after the gun if you’re in White (last corral). They did **wave starts** since 2019 (Gold/Silver/Red go at 6:30, then a few minutes gap, Green/Purple, etc.)<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/leadville-100-mtb-2019/9737?page=2#:~:text=Looks%20like%20there%20is%20a,rather%20than%20all%20at%20once)</u>. So coordinate with your crew where to meet after start or where they should go (crew usually doesn’t hang at the start, they leave as soon as rider departs to get to Pipeline or Twin Lakes ahead of the racers). Transportation: if you’re staying outside of town, account for road closures – the road out of Leadville to Twin Lakes (HWY 24/CO 300) gets controlled when the race starts (for safety, as cyclists go out). So crews often need to take alternate route or leave early. The **athlete guide** gives driving directions for crews (e.g., alternate route to Pipeline vs Twin Lakes).
* **During Race - Tactics with Crew:** Good crews have a **station system**: a small folding table or bright flag so rider can spot them among hundreds at Twin Lakes. They’ll have bottles ready (marked with caffeine or not, etc.), food unwrapped, maybe a chair if needed. But time spent not moving is time lost – many racers try to keep stops to <1 minute. The saying: “beware the chair” – if you sit, you might not want to get up! So crews should encourage but also push you out quickly unless you truly need a rest.
* **Medical:** There are roving medics and each aid has medical. If one is feeling altitude sickness or severe issues, don’t be shy to seek help. If you take ibuprofen (common for altitude headache or soreness), be cautious with hydration (NSAIDs + dehydration can strain kidneys). Some riders take acetazolamide (Diamox) prophylactically for altitude – if so, that’s a prescription you need to plan with your doctor well before (and test if it makes you feel weird). That’s not common unless someone knows they get altitude sick.
* **Post-Race:** Logistics of retrieving drop bags (if any), and getting your bike back while you’re exhausted. If you have crew, they’ll help. If not, the volunteers often can help carry your stuff to a rest area. There’s usually a finish festival with food (often a catered meal or food trucks for racers). Many racers stash a jacket or clothes near finish (with crew or in a bag) because after finishing and cooling down, you might get very cold (especially if finishing under 9h, it might still be afternoon but you’re depleted and temps could drop if rain).
* **Leadville Town:** Town is small – two main streets. During the race the main drag is closed for the finish line (red carpet etc.). Spectators line that last stretch; it’s quite a scene. For lodging check-out: Many Airbnbs require Sunday check-out 11am – you’ll be done Saturday by evening, so that’s fine. Some stick around Sunday for the **awards ceremony** (usually 7:30 or 8am Sunday, quick program and awards for winners and acknowledgement of buckle earners, etc.). If you got a big buckle, you might want to be there to celebrate.
* **Altitude Tent Rentals:** If you want an altitude tent, companies like Hypoxico and MileHighTraining offer them – you must plan that months ahead as they have limited rentals especially leading up to Leadville. (Hypoxico had a special in 2017 – $1200 for 8 weeks)<u>[leadvilleraceseries.com](https://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/acclimatize-for-the-leadville-100-from-home/#:~:text=Acclimatize%20for%20the%20Leadville%20Trail,Trail%20100%20MTB%20and)</u><u>[leadvilleraceseries.com](https://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/acclimatize-for-the-leadville-100-from-home/#:~:text=Special%20Rental%20Package%20for%20LT100,Trail%20100%20MTB%20and)</u>; cheaper options exist but still costly. And you have to commit to sleeping in it regularly.
* **General Altitude Prep:** Arrive early, **avoid intense exertion in first day or two** (let body adjust), **hydrate** a ton, maybe **skip alcohol**, and possibly **higher carb diet** as some suggest. Some riders use **supplements** like beet juice (start a few days prior) or even bicarbonate loading (for lactate buffering) – but altitude is the main factor to address.
* **Local Rentals & Services:** If you need last-minute gear in Leadville, there are a couple of bike shops (Cycles of Life, etc.), but inventory is limited – better to bring what you need (tires, sealant, etc.). You can rent oxygen concentrators in Denver or at altitude gear shops, but that’s overkill for most.
* **Altitude House Rentals:** Some do a **“staging”** by renting a place in Frisco (9000 ft) for a week, then move to Leadville (10,200 ft) few days pre-race to reduce shock. Others might camp at say 11k ft for a night or two a week before to stimulate RBC production (not super effective short-term though, but psychological maybe).
* **Preparing Crew:** If your crew is not used to altitude, note that even spectating can tire them (hiking to an aid spot, carrying stuff). Ensure they have warm clothes, snacks, water – it’s a long day for them too (sometimes harder on crew mentally than rider!). Remind them phone service may drop, so set clear times like “If I’m not at Twin Lakes by X time, something’s wrong.” Provide them your projected splits (like from the chart earlier<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/leadville-100-mtb-2019/9737?page=2#:~:text=For%20sub%209%3A)</u>). Also designate a **Plan if you DNF** – e.g., if you quit at Twin Lakes, how to convey to crew at Pipeline so they’re not waiting forever. Usually, if someone DNFs, they hitch a ride with sweep or crew from that station back to town; they can alert officials to inform the finish.
* **Weather Logistics:** Prepare a small **“bad weather kit”**: e.g., a ziplock with rain jacket, waterproof gloves, maybe a buff, that can be thrown to you at Twin Lakes if a storm threatens. Crews should monitor forecast and carry those items. In 2009, many crews didn’t have extra cold-weather gear ready and riders suffered. Now folks are wiser – even if forecast is sunny, have that garbage bag or light raincoat in the car just in case.
* **Environmental:** Leadville emphasizes “Leave no trace” – there are penalties for littering. So don’t plan to chuck gel wrappers (some races allow dropping near aid for volunteers to sweep, but it’s frowned upon outside those zones). Put empties in pocket or give to crew.
* **Altitude Tent Rental pickup:** Hypoxico offered shipping of altitude tents. If you did that, finishing with the gear – some actually bring a small tent to Leadville to sleep in at night to stay acclimated if they acclimated artificially. Slight details like that mostly apply to top racers who swear by maintaining acclimation.
* **Pre-Race Events:** There’s often a **“Carbo-loading dinner”** Friday or a welcome dinner (sometimes included for riders). Also a Thursday night **“Leadville Legends” panel or Q&A** might happen where veterans talk tips. Attend if you can – you might pick up a last-minute insight.
* **Altitude simulation lodging:** Another cunning logistic some have used – there are “altitude rental houses” around Denver with hypoxic rooms (for example, some Olympians have hypoxic bedrooms they rent out). But that’s beyond typical. Or simply, some sleep in the ski resort town of **Leadville itself** (10k ft) vs down in BV (8k ft) to maximize high elevation overnight. Because “sleep high” can stimulate RBC production after even one night or two (though full effect takes longer).
* **After the Race:** Many stick around to celebrate. Leadville has a tradition of a **Sunday morning 12-hour “podium” for sub-12 finishers** (basically all finishers get to go on stage by age group to get a finisher medal, etc. – if they still do that). If you get a big buckle, you’ll want to flaunt it at the awards or downtown. Some go have a massive burger and beers at Periodic Brewing or Quincy’s after finishing, but note your stomach might be off. Some caution: altitude can suppress appetite – eat anyway to recover.
* **Lodging Check-out:** If you finish by 6-7pm, some leave that night to sleep at lower elevation (to feel better). But many are too tired; better to stay until Sunday, enjoy the awards, then depart. The roads out of Leadville on Saturday night see a stream of cars of those who want thicker air or to catch flights Sunday. But driving down curvy mountain roads while extremely fatigued is risky – consider rest.
So, **in summary of logistics**: Start planning early (lottery app, lodging, crew), arrive early if possible, have a clear crew plan (who goes where, with what), adapt for altitude in all aspects (hydration, not overexerting early, having contingencies for weather), and dial in all the small details like drop bags, gear to carry vs gear with crew. Good logistics won’t win you the race, but bad logistics can certainly lose it (DNF or miss buckle due to something preventable). The goal is to make the day as smooth as possible so you can focus on pedaling. One might say **“Leadville is 50% physical, 50% mental, and 50% logistics”** – the math may be off, but the point stands: don’t neglect the planning, because at 12,000 ft your brain will appreciate that you did.
## **"WHAT I WISH I KNEW" QUOTES**
To close out, here are some genuine **“What I wish I knew before Leadville”** insights and quotes from those who have been through it:
* *“****Pacing****: I wish I had started more conservatively. I killed the first 20 miles and felt like a hero, but Leadville* ***punishes fast starters****. By mile 60 I was cooked. It’s better to hold back early – you will make up tons of time in the last 20 miles if you’re not blown. In retrospect, as everyone says, don’t own the first 20 miles and blow up spectacularly later*<u>*[leadvilleraceseries.com](https://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/dispatches-from-columbine-top-10-things-to-know-before-your-first-leadville-trail-100-mtb/#:~:text=You%20just%20don%E2%80%99t%20recover%20the,the%20air%20is%20that%20thin)*</u>*. I did exactly that my first time.”**“****Train your gut*** *as much as your legs. I* ***wish I’d practiced taking in 90+g of carbs/hour sooner*** *– my stomach gave out during the race because I wasn’t used to that intake*<u>*[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/leadville-100-mtb-2019/9737?page=2#:~:text=helmets,done%20more%20of%20this%20earlier)*</u>*. Start doing it in training months out. You can’t suddenly force 3000 calories in 12 hours if you’ve never done it. Now I make nutrition the ‘4th discipline’ of my training. As one coach said: ‘Train to eat – find the right combo to get 100g/hr. I wish I’d done more of this earlier.’*<u>*[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/leadville-100-mtb-2019/9737?page=2#:~:text=helmets,done%20more%20of%20this%20earlier)*</u> *That quote hit home after my bonk at Powerline.”**“****Altitude humility****: As a strong sea-level rider, I figured altitude might slow me 10%.* ***Wrong.*** *It felt like 20-25% drop at times. I wish I’d known just how much altitude would affect me – ‘by 10,000 feet you’re at 15% less power’*<u>*[bicycling.com](https://www.bicycling.com/training/g20045947/this-is-your-body-on-altitude/#:~:text=The%20same%20hill%20you%20could,once%20you%20hit%20high%20altitude)*</u> *is what the experts say, and man did I feel it. In hindsight, I would either arrive earlier or adjust my pacing down even more. Also, I should have taken altitude symptoms (headache, poor sleep) seriously rather than brushing them off. Being prepared for insomnia and having remedies (melatonin or just an understanding it might happen) would have helped. Flatlanders:* ***respect the altitude and calibrate expectations*** *– I learned that the hard way.”**“****Little things cost time****: I wasted too much time at aid stations. I wish someone told me to* ***keep stops super short****. I sat down at Twin Lakes to change socks and lost 5-10 minutes that I desperately needed at the end. Next time: no sitting, as volunteers say, ‘beware the chair!’ I now practice ‘pit-stop’ style aid: in and out. Also related: I fiddled with my Camelbak too long. Perhaps bottles and crew hand-ups would’ve been smarter for me. Efficiency is key – those minutes matter for the buckle.”**“****Equipment hindsight****: I love my full-suspension bike, but honestly I wish I had used a hardtail or lighter setup. My bike was ~27 lbs with dropper and beefy tires, which was comfortable but cost me on climbs. After seeing so many others on whippet 21-lb hardtails flying uphill, I realized equipment choice is huge. As one rider said: ‘Optimize your equipment: tires, kit, chain, helmet – I saw so many slow tires and flappy clothing costing people 20-40 watts.’*<u>*[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/leadville-100-mtb-2019/9737?page=2#:~:text=1,done%20more%20of%20this%20earlier)*</u> *I definitely had too aggressive tires (Ardent treads) that year. Now I go with faster tires and no dropper to save weight. Comfort is fine, but I had overkill. I wish I knew how non-technical the course really is – less than 2 miles of singletrack*<u>*[facebook.com](https://www.facebook.com/CyclingWeekly/posts/has-leadville-100-become-a-gravel-racewhy-are-pros-racing-the-biggest-mtb-race-i/1170534518437150/#:~:text=Has%20Leadville%20100%20become%20a,the%20entire%20104%20mile%20race)*</u>*, so you can get away with a more ‘roadie’ setup than I thought.”**“****Corral matters****: The first year I started back in White corral and lost a lot of time in traffic. I wish I’d realized how important* ***starting position*** *is if you have time goals. Doing a qualifier for a better corral or sneaking up in the wave can save you 15-20 minutes of bottleneck on Kevins. A veteran told me: ‘If you want sub-9, get to at least Green or Red corral.’*<u>*[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/leadville-100-mtb-2019/9737?page=2#:~:text=I%20also%20recommend%20doing%20a,through%20the%20lottery%20to%20both)*</u> *They were right. I spent energy passing people early that I could have conserved if I started up front. So I’d tell newbies: if possible, do an earlier season race to improve your corral seeding. It’s an often overlooked aspect.”**“****The Columbine bottleneck****: I expected to be able to ride more of Columbine than I did. I wish I knew that pretty much everyone ends up walking the top section. I beat myself up thinking I’d failed because I had to walk, but later learned even pros often dab there. It’s normal – don’t let it demoralize you. A quote I saw after: ‘If something seems insurmountable, Leadville athletes adapt and astound us every time.’*<u>*[leadvilleraceseries.com](https://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024_EVCO-LRS_100MTB_AthleteGuide.pdf#:~:text=up%20Columbine%2C%20if%20something%20seems,the%20most%20significant%20listed%20below)*</u> *It reminded me that hiking was just adapting. So, I’d tell my past self: be mentally ready to hike, and use that time to recover a bit rather than seeing it as failure.”**“****Weather prep****: I wish I had carried a lightweight windbreaker in my pocket. We had a sudden hailstorm (or even just the long Columbine descent windchill) and I froze because I left my jacket with crew. Now I’d rather have it and not need it than need it and not have it. High-altitude weather turns quick – ‘it could rain, hail or even snow’*<u>*[leadvilleraceseries.com](https://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Leadville-Athlete-Guide-100-RUN-Read-Only.pdf#:~:text=,rain%2C%20hail%20and%20even%20snow)*</u> *– believe it. In 2009 I saw people DNF who simply got too cold. So, pack the darn jacket!”**“****Drafting and group tactics****: Coming from MTB, I wasn’t used to riding in packs. I wish I knew how important* ***drafting on the flats*** *would be. On Pipeline return I found myself alone into a headwind – brutal! Next time I made sure to leave Twin Lakes inbound with a group and worked together. It saved a lot of energy. So, mountain bikers, practice some road skills or at least be aware: Leadville is a MTB race with road tactics.*<u>*[leadvilleraceseries.com](https://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/dispatches-from-columbine-top-10-things-to-know-before-your-first-leadville-trail-100-mtb/#:~:text=It%20requires%20the%20largest%20range,your%20competitors%20in%20certain%20sections)*</u> *That was an eye-opener told by Rebecca Rusch and it’s true. Work with others when you can.”**“****Don’t overpack your bike****: I had a ton of spares/tools on me ‘just in case’ – my pack probably weighed 8-10 lbs. I wish I’d streamlined that. Aid stations have tech support, and a reasonable kit (tube, CO2, multi-tool) is enough. One guy said, ‘People carried too much – it’s 100 miles, not an expedition.’ I realized I carried enough for three people. Next time, I left most with crew and only carried essentials. The lighter load felt so much better.”*Finally, a heartfelt quote from a finisher encapsulating hindsight: *“In Leadville, you will find your limit – and then push beyond it. I wish I had believed in myself more going in. Ken Chlouber’s mantra ‘You’re better than you think you are, you can do more than you think you can’*<u>*[leadvilleraceseries.com](https://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/mtb/leadvilletrail100mtb/#:~:text=In%201994%2C%20150%20gutsy%20riders,The%20red%20carpet%20awaits)*</u> *turned out to be true. I doubted whether I belonged there, but I did finish. So I’d tell future riders: prepare well, respect the race, but don’t underestimate yourself either. You might surprise yourself out there across the sky.”*
These “wish I knew” nuggets, from pacing and fueling to gear and mindset, can hopefully help the next Leadville racer avoid some common pitfalls and tackle this epic challenge a bit wiser. Good luck – and remember to **dig deep**!<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/leadville-100-mtb-2019/9737?page=2#:~:text=My%20tips%3A)</u><u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/leadville-100-mtb-2019/9737?page=2#:~:text=helmets,done%20more%20of%20this%20earlier)</u>
