# LITTLE APPLE 100 — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Unnamed rider [ELITE]:** "Dark thoughts are evil things. They suck the life from your legs and squeeze the blood from your heart until you utter the words, 'I quit.' What's the point of physically training, if we don't also train our minds to be positive thinkers?" (https://www.rawbikefitting.com/blog/2018/08/little-apple-100)

**Unnamed rider [ELITE]:** "I popped off the group 11 miles into the race. I pressed lap on my garmin and let those evil thoughts win. I spent the next 5 miles trying to convince myself why I love gravel, and to just go slow, it doesn't matter." (https://www.rawbikefitting.com/blog/2018/08/little-apple-100)

**Leah [ELITE]:** Working with another dropped rider: "She rolls up {I thought you were in front of me!} and we both acknowledge the task at hand and agree to team time trial the shit out of this fu*king race. Having this mutual agreement was clutch." They stopped when cramping, and finished 2nd/3rd. (https://www.rawbikefitting.com/blog/2018/08/little-apple-100)

**Coach_Theia [UNKNOWN]:** "At every point of a ride/race you should be in a place where you can safely swerve away from what's happening in front of you. In this race I was either on the far right or far left sides, in the smooth section and close to the grass with no riders between me and my exit strategy (in this case, the grass). That allowed me to ride into the grass on the right and avoid this crash, which happened just inches ahead of me." (https://discuss.360velo.com/t/little-apple-100-crash/1386)

**dfriestedt [UNKNOWN]:** "DO NOT RIDE IN THE ROUGH GRAVEL BETWEEN TWO RIDERS. You and only you are responsible for your front wheel. If you overlap wheels in rough gravel you are asking for trouble. You should never ride this close, in gravel, between riders. Only ride in the rough gravel (in the middle of the road) to go between the smooth sections." (https://discuss.360velo.com/t/little-apple-100-crash/1386)

**Ironman Chris [COMPETITIVE]:** "The gravel section is hard enough, but the course started heading uphill and into a headwind. It was at this point that I realized the packs of riders ahead would be tough to catch, and I found myself riding pretty much on my own, which I didn't mind." (https://anamazingrun.com/2025/08/03/little-apple-gravel-race-50k-race-report/)

**Ironman Chris [COMPETITIVE]:** "Someone nicknamed a section of very soft gravel the 'Devil's Gravel,' and that section had some white knuckle moments." (https://anamazingrun.com/2025/08/03/little-apple-gravel-race-50k-race-report/)

**50K Open Winner (commenter) [ELITE]:** "The gravel today was loose and I went down in a corner as well. I promise there are so many different types of gravel and today was just a lot rougher than usual." (https://anamazingrun.com/2025/08/03/little-apple-gravel-race-50k-race-report/)

**batwood14 [ELITE]:** "Never … and I mean NEVER … in my experience has a race profile so understated the difficulty of a course, nor caused me to misjudge how I thought a race would play out." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/midwest-events-for-2023/79346?page=12)

**batwood14 [ELITE]:** "The one word description I would use for the course is 'slush' … the gravel was deeper, thicker and sketchier than anything I had previously been on... Some of the roads were dirt, some rocky with hard-pack grooves … but 50% of the gravel was deep, loose-over-loose … culminating with a coup de grâce in a place called Cougar Rd. about 10 miles from the finish which saw half of the remaining riders I was with bury their front wheel and either go down, or have to put a leg out and stop." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/midwest-events-for-2023/79346?page=12)

**batwood14 [ELITE]:** "Every 90-degree turn that was gravel-to-gravel made me feel like I was going to crash. If we were riding in a decent groove and had to flip to the other side of the road to pass a rider … I felt like I was going to crash. When I wasn't pulling, watching the riders' wheels in front of me was completely unnerving because they were constantly sliding and fish-tailing." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/midwest-events-for-2023/79346?page=12)

**batwood14 [ELITE]:** "After an hour we were down to a lead group of about 12, after two hours it was 6. One rider flatted and another crashed taking a corner at about 5 mph … his front wheel just washed out on 2-inch deep gravel." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/midwest-events-for-2023/79346?page=12)

**batwood14 [ELITE]:** "We hit a rise at mile 57 and the two others surged — I tired to respond but it felt like I was pushing with oatmeal. I was dropped on a hill that just 3 hours earlier I wouldn't have even called a hill" (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/midwest-events-for-2023/79346?page=12)

**batwood14 [ELITE]:** On missing podium by half a wheel: "Summoning all my remaining strength, I uncorked a whopping 680W sprint and lost to him by a half-wheel for a 4th place overall. Honestly, I feel good about the result, but missing a podium by inches stings." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/midwest-events-for-2023/79346?page=12)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**teddygram [UNKNOWN]:** "You will not have 'the right' tire choice because it literally has a mix of everything (concrete, fast gravel and VERY chunky gravel). The chunky stuff is not very much maybe 5-miles? but you will wish you had 48's on the bike. The fast gravel is IMO a 40mm tire optimized and the tarmac… well its tarmac haha. I did it with 39mm measured tires (Pirelli Cinturato H) and did 19mph AVG @ 203AP/231NP. Full race setup was 225lbs and I 'think' i did a 41/42psi mix." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/midwest-events-for-2023/79346?page=12)

**teddygram [UNKNOWN]:** Recommended 38mm tires for the course before batwood14's race. (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/midwest-events-for-2023/79346?page=12)

**batwood14 [ELITE]:** "I rode my OPEN UPPER with 35mm Schwalbe G-One R tires. These are fantastic, fast tires and I can't wait to roll them in the Rough Road and Barry Roubaix next year, but were wildly overmatched on this course. @teddygram recommended 38s for the job and by the time I read that here it was too late to swap … but if I was doing it again, I would either do it with 40s with some knobs, or perhaps 42s." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/midwest-events-for-2023/79346?page=12)

**CAUTION:** The above tire recommendations come from riders at different levels with different race pacing. teddygram's 39mm setup worked for a 19mph/203W average effort. batwood14 (racing for podium at elite level) found 35mm too narrow for the conditions and would go 40-42mm.

## Weather Experienced

**August 2023:** Hot and humid conditions. One rider went through four 750ml bottles (each with 1000mg Precision Hydration tab) in just over 3 hours. Computer recorded high of 90°F, mostly low/mid 80s, but high humidity was described as "a capital-P problem." Cloud cover rolled in about 2/3 through providing some relief. The Illinois cornfields "seem to have a way of radiating heat." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/midwest-events-for-2023/79346?page=12)

**August 2021:** Clear, 74 degrees, wind 9 mph (https://results.bikereg.com/race/13746)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Course profile vs. reality:** "Never … and I mean NEVER … in my experience has a race profile so understated the difficulty of a course" — the 100K has only 600 ft of climbing but is described as anything but a "gravel crit." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/midwest-events-for-2023/79346?page=12)

**Course composition:** Billed as 88% gravel running through farm areas of southern Chicago area. Mix includes concrete, fast gravel, very chunky gravel (~5 miles), and dirt roads. (https://anamazingrun.com/2025/08/03/little-apple-gravel-race-50k-race-report/ and https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/midwest-events-for-2023/79346?page=12)

**Gravel character:** 50% of gravel described as "deep, loose-over-loose" with "slush" quality. Some sections rocky with hard-pack grooves. "Devil's Gravel" section has very soft gravel with white knuckle moments. (https://anamazingrun.com/2025/08/03/little-apple-gravel-race-50k-race-report/ and https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/midwest-events-for-2023/79346?page=12)

**Cougar Road:** A notorious section about 10 miles from the 100K finish where "half of the remaining riders I was with bury their front wheel and either go down, or have to put a leg out and stop." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/midwest-events-for-2023/79346?page=12)

**Crash dynamics:** Multiple riders noted crashes on gravel-to-gravel 90-degree turns. One rider crashed "taking a corner at about 5 mph … his front wheel just washed out on 2-inch deep gravel." First crash observed was rider going into first turn "a little too hot" and wiping out. (https://anamazingrun.com/2025/08/03/little-apple-gravel-race-50k-race-report/ and https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/midwest-events-for-2023/79346?page=12)

**Road positioning:** Rough gravel typically in middle of road; smooth sections on tire-worn tracks on sides of road. Riders advised to stay in smooth sections except when passing. (https://discuss.360velo.com/t/little-apple-100-crash/1386)

**Support on course:** At mile 45 (100K), a house on course had "the cutest little cheer leaders {and cold water!}" One rider had a personal cooler at halfway point. (https://www.rawbikefitting.com/blog/2018/08/little-apple-100)

**Course terrain:** "Pretty much pancake flat" with "no tree coverage" making heat a significant factor. (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/midwest-events-for-2023/79346?page=12)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**[UNKNOWN] teddygram:** 100K at 19mph average, 203W AP / 231W NP at 225lbs race weight. (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/midwest-events-for-2023/79346?page=12)

**[ELITE] batwood14:** 100K Open race dynamics: "After an hour we were down to a lead group of about 12, after two hours it was 6." The race was "completely attritional" where "in many cases totally negated any advantage of hiding in the group because we were almost always single file and the rolling resistance was super high." By mile ~54, three riders remained in lead group. (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/midwest-events-for-2023/79346?page=12)

**[ELITE] batwood14 hydration:** Went through four 750ml bottles (each with 1000mg Precision Hydration tab) in just over 3 hours of racing in hot/humid conditions. (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/midwest-events-for-2023/79346?page=12)

**[COMPETITIVE] Ironman Chris:** "As we got rolling and started racing, we came to the first turn and the first section of gravel, and that is when I saw my first crash... It was at this point that I realized the packs of riders ahead would be tough to catch, and I found myself riding pretty much on my own, which I didn't mind." Finished 50K in 1:53:20 (16.2 mph average, 30.68 miles). (https://anamazingrun.com/2025/08/03/little-apple-gravel-race-50k-race-report/)

**[ELITE] Mental game:** "I've second guessed my ability to battle far too often. I've let those dark thoughts creep in far too often. I do realize I don't give myself enough credit for the massive accomplishment on June 2nd." (https://www.rawbikefitting.com/blog/2018/08/little-apple-100)

**Start protocol:** Neutral roll-out for about a mile, then racing begins. (https://anamazingrun.com/2025/08/03/little-apple-gravel-race-50k-race-report/)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Crashes:** Multiple documented crashes on gravel-to-gravel turns, even at low speeds (5 mph). First turn after neutral rollout saw a crash. "A few broken bones, but nothing major" from one crash incident. Orange-jersey rider crashed from overlapping wheels between two riders in rough gravel while grabbing front brake. (https://discuss.360velo.com/t/little-apple-100-crash/1386 and https://anamazingrun.com/2025/08/03/little-apple-gravel-race-50k-race-report/)

**Mental challenges:** "Dark thoughts" and negative self-talk leading to considering dropping at one lap. (https://www.rawbikefitting.com/blog/2018/08/little-apple-100)

**Tire choice consequences:** Riders with too-narrow or too-slick tires struggling significantly with deep gravel sections, particularly Cougar Road. (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/midwest-events-for-2023/79346?page=12)

**2023 100K Open DNF count:** 7 DNFs out of 64 starters in the Gravel 1-5 category (https://results.bikereg.com/race/17684)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Post-race scene:** "Try to carve out or allot some time to hang out at the highway bar afterwards, it really is fun and a good time and they appreciate you being there." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/midwest-events-for-2023/79346?page=12)

**Rider interactions:** Story of teddygram recognizing batwood14 at finish despite never meeting, guiding him to bench, getting ice water, and dumping one down his back: "Maybe one of the best things I've ever felt in my life. A completely awesome gesture and great favor from a guy I'd never met anywhere but on this forum." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/midwest-events-for-2023/79346?page=12)
