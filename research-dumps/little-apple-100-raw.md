# LITTLE APPLE 100 - RAW RESEARCH DUMP

Based on my search results, I must clarify an important finding: **The search results do not confirm the existence of a race specifically called "Little Apple 100."** Instead, the available data documents the **Little Apple Gravel Race: Illinois State Championships**, which offers multiple distance options including a 100km distance.

## What the Search Results Actually Show

**Race Name & Dates:**
The official race is called the **Little Apple Gravel Race: Illinois State Championships**, held in **Manhattan, Illinois**[2][3][5]. The most recent documented date in the search results is **Sunday, August 3, 2025**[1][2][3][4][5].

**Location & Start Details:**
- Address: **525 South State Street, Manhattan, Illinois 60442**[4][5]
- Start time: **8:00 AM CDT** (as of the 2025 event)[4]

**Distance Options:**
The race offers **multiple distance options**: 150km, 100km, and 50km, with the 150km leaving at 8:00 AM[4]. The search results do not specifically isolate a standalone "100-mile" option or provide separate elevation data for the 100km distance.

## Data Gaps & What Cannot Be Confirmed

The search results do **not** provide:
- Registration costs or entry fees
- Field size or participant numbers
- Prize purse information
- Detailed terrain breakdown (% gravel vs. pavement vs. singletrack)
- Named climbs or sector details
- Technical difficulty ratings
- Elevation profiles or specific elevation gain figures
- Weather history or typical conditions
- Lodging or parking details
- Nearest airport information
- Race history, founding year, or founder information
- Notable past winners or professional participants
- Rider reviews, Reddit discussions, or YouTube coverage
- DNF rates or detailed race reports

**Historical Note:** The search results show earlier iterations of this race—one dated August 13, 2023[6], and another dated August 3-4, 2024[7]—suggesting the race has been held annually in early August, though exact consistency is not confirmed.

## Conclusion

To compile the comprehensive research dump you've requested, I would need access to additional sources beyond these initial results: the official race website, registration platforms like BikeReg or Bike Signup, cycling forums (Reddit's r/gravelcycling), Strava segments, race reports, and local cycling community coverage. The current search results confirm the race exists and is held in Manhattan, Illinois, but lack the depth of detail needed for a complete research document.
