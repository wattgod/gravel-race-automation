# LITTLE SUGAR MTB — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Greg Marchand [COMPETITIVE]:** "I had a really tough patch about 2 hours into Little Sugar. I'd been battling a bad stomach that morning, and was close to needing to pull over and handle a bit of business. My legs just weren't quite firing with the power required to stick with the front group either. I had to dig pretty deep mentally to keep my head in the game, but things came around and I snagged a top ten just by staying consistent and committed." (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/little-sugar-mtb-2024)

**Greg Marchand [COMPETITIVE]:** "I simply didn't have that dog in me. I was overwhelmed by the logistics and unprepared for the races themselves. In early summer I made the decision to defer my registration to 2025... Suddenly it was August and the Big Sugar group chat got busy. Every day I'd pick up my phone to photos of gas station delicacies from long training rides, course updates and race strategy from my favorite locals... At some point the conversation found its way to how much the sport had changed since we'd started doing these stupid races together." (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/little-sugar-mtb-2024)

**Haley Batten [ELITE]:** "It's fantastic, it keeps you on your toes for sure. I had a blast riding the trails all week and checking out the course. It's hard racing, it's pretty relentless. I thought [going into the race] there's not much climbing, it's pretty rolling, but when you're out there it's relentless." (https://outdoorindustry.org/press-release/haley-batten-and-keegan-swenson-win-inaugural-life-time-little-sugar-mtb-race-to-kick-off-big-sugar-classic-week/)

**Cameron Jones [ELITE]:** "I had awesome legs today. The plan was simple—be up front in the singletrack, ride my own pace, and stay out of trouble. I cooked it a bit early and started to cramp, but it was good to have that buffer. Fun day on the trails." (https://www.progravelmagazine.com/post/gómez-villafañe-and-jones-go-solo-at-little-sugar-mtb)

**Sofía Gómez Villafañe [ELITE]:** "I went solo up the grassy hill at the start and expected Alexis to catch me, but she was riding her own pace. It was a bit lonely out there, but my legs were good today. Maybe too much altitude training—but it worked!" (https://www.progravelmagazine.com/post/gómez-villafañe-and-jones-go-solo-at-little-sugar-mtb)

**jdietrich [UNKNOWN]:** "Pre rode the course over 2 days this weekend and was pretty toasted. The 90% single track is also another factor many don't give credit to. Many other rides have a fair amount of 4x4 roads, fire roads, etc mixed in. Constant tight single track mile for mile is much more taxing in my opinion. I did Austin Rattler last year and this course puts it to shame. I am really anxious to see their cut off times. This being their first year I hope they are not too aggressive as I can already see a lot of DNF's. Coming from a few other qualifiers as well as the LT100 itself I personally feel this is the hardest in the catalog." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/little-sugar-mtb/86468?page=2)

**mailman [UNKNOWN]:** "This race sounds *a lot* like my A-Race the (greatest XCM in the world) Whaka 100 in Rotorua, NZ. I completely agree that the Singletrack riding really changes things and a lot of people don't account for the added fatigue enough. It's all about pacing." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/little-sugar-mtb/86468?page=2)

**Allied Cycle Works rider [ELITE]:** "I look forward to seeing how the route progresses in future iterations – it would be awesome to see some of the new handcut trails included in the future... I had a really tough patch about 2 hours into Little Sugar... My legs just weren't quite firing with the power required to stick with the front group either. I had to dig pretty deep mentally to keep my head in the game... In Big Sugar, I again could feel from early on that I wasn't having my best day, but pulled out every trick I know to hang with the lead group. I actually got dropped out of that lead group three times, but each time convinced myself to fight back to it. It was really tough. I actually vomited coming back to the group the third time."

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Tire Choices:**

**tgoods [UNKNOWN]:** "While pre-riding this weekend I had a huge sidewall slash on my rear Mezcal. I'm going to run the Syerra with Cushcore XC for race. While it may be a slower tire with different riding characteristics than what I prefer, I like that's is 60tpi for puncture resistance. I don't want my A race to be marred by a PITA tire puncture." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/little-sugar-mtb/86468?page=2)

**Alex_NoCo [UNKNOWN]:** "I've been testing out some Specialized grid t7s with cushcore xc in the rear tire this past week. They are pretty beefy compared to what I'm used to, but sounds like they might be good for this race." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/little-sugar-mtb/86468?page=2)

**webdev511 [UNKNOWN]:** "Airliners, Silca sealant with the mondo fibers, and the MTB equivalent of Unbound razor resistant sidewalls." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/little-sugar-mtb/86468?page=2)

**Allied rider [ELITE]:** "At Little Sugar, I rode... Maxxis Rekon Race 2.35 tires. The rubber on those tires is stiff and thick as hell, making them tougher to ride than a more supple tire, but it's worth it on these super sharp OZ rocks. Even with that added reinforcement, I actually cut my front tire about 3 hours in, but luckily the Orange Seal sealed it up." (https://alliedcycleworks.com/blogs/stories/big-little-sugar-bike-check)

**Bike Setup:**

**Allied rider [ELITE]:** "At Little Sugar, I rode the BEAUTIFUL new OZ Limited Edition BC40 with a SRAM T-Type 38x10-52 drivetrain, the new ZIPP 1Zero Hitop SW wheels, and Maxxis Rekon Race 2.35 tires." (https://alliedcycleworks.com/blogs/stories/big-little-sugar-bike-check)

**mhandwerk [UNKNOWN]:** Asked about gearing planning. **tgoods [UNKNOWN]** responded: "34T with 10-50 Cassette. Targeting 11mph pace." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/little-sugar-mtb/86468?page=2)

**Handlebar Rule:** "No drop bars – For rider safety and course compatibility, drop-style handlebars (road or gravel bars with drops) are no longer permitted for the Life Time Little Sugar MTB. All competitors must use flat or riser-style handlebars. This rule will be enforced during pre-race inspections and on course; violations may result in disqualification." (https://www.bigsugarclassic.com/mtb/)

## Weather Experienced

**Christopher Blevins race (2024) [ELITE]:** "Olympians and world champion mountain bikers were faced with an unseasonably hot and dusty day Sunday at the Little Sugar MTB race." (https://www.nwaonline.com/news/2024/oct/14/little-sugar-mtb-race-returns-to-bentonville/)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Course Characteristics:**

**Haley Batten [ELITE]:** Characterized the course as "relentless" despite not having massive climbing. "I thought [going into the race] there's not much climbing, it's pretty rolling, but when you're out there it's relentless." (https://outdoorindustry.org/press-release/haley-batten-and-keegan-swenson-win-inaugural-life-time-little-sugar-mtb-race-to-kick-off-big-sugar-classic-week/)

**jdietrich [UNKNOWN]:** "The 90% single track is also another factor many don't give credit to. Many other rides have a fair amount of 4x4 roads, fire roads, etc mixed in. Constant tight single track mile for mile is much more taxing in my opinion... This course is going to be brutal due to the constant steep climbing as noted." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/little-sugar-mtb/86468?page=2)

**Alex_NoCo [COMPETITIVE]:** "The dynamics of the course (many short punchy climbs) is going to be so different than what I'm used to in CO... So excited for what seems to be a true MTB race. I've done several 50+ mile techy single track races in the past. Usually it's the full body strength/endurance that ends up being most important vs. just pure climbing fitness." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/little-sugar-mtb/86468?page=2)

**Rock Concerns:**

**Allied rider [ELITE]:** Referenced "these super sharp OZ rocks" that required reinforced tires and still resulted in a front tire cut 3 hours into the race. (https://alliedcycleworks.com/blogs/stories/big-little-sugar-bike-check)

**Official Description:** "Riders traversed through grinding climbs, rolling descents, and rough and rocky limestone, with views of caves, waterfalls, and iconic ledges on the trails of Bella Vista and Bentonville." (https://outdoorindustry.org/press-release/haley-batten-and-keegan-swenson-win-inaugural-life-time-little-sugar-mtb-race-to-kick-off-big-sugar-classic-week/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Elite Pacing:**

**tgoods [UNKNOWN]:** "I think the winner of the pro race will around 13.5mph, so around 4.5hrs. If I remember correctly the tip of the spear at the Oz Trails Epics were in the 14mph - 15mph range? But that was with a larger percentage of road and only on the east side of Bella Vista (Back 40) which has less elevation than the west side (Little Sugar). For the amateur fields I think 10.5 to 11.5 mph gets podiums. (5.5 - 6hrs.)" (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/little-sugar-mtb/86468?page=2)

**Actual 2023 Elite Results [ELITE]:**
- Haley Batten won in 4:53:22 (12.7 mph average)
- Keegan Swenson won in 4:25:16 (14.0 mph average)
(https://outdoorindustry.org/press-release/haley-batten-and-keegan-swenson-win-inaugural-life-time-little-sugar-mtb-race-to-kick-off-big-sugar-classic-week/)

**Actual 2025 Elite Results [ELITE]:**
- Cameron Jones won in 4:17:00 (14.5 mph average)
- Sofía Gómez Villafañe won in 5:08:32 (12.1 mph average)
(https://www.progravelmagazine.com/post/gómez-villafañe-and-jones-go-solo-at-little-sugar-mtb)

**Start Strategy:**

**Cameron Jones [ELITE]:** "The plan was simple—be up front in the singletrack, ride my own pace, and stay out of trouble." (https://www.progravelmagazine.com/post/gómez-villafañe-and-jones-go-solo-at-little-sugar-mtb)

**Sofía Gómez Villafañe [ELITE]:** "I went solo up the grassy hill at the start and expected Alexis to catch me, but she was riding her own pace." (https://www.progravelmagazine.com/post/gómez-villafañe-and-jones-go-solo-at-little-sugar-mtb)

**mailman [UNKNOWN]:** "But isn't it funny how crazy the start of a race can be. How often you ride along thinking 'why on earth are we going so hard'. Obviously there must be someone leading the way who is riding the right pace, but then there is a huge number of people who are following riding way over their heads." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/little-sugar-mtb/86468?page=2)

**Mid-Race Strategy:**

**Allied rider [ELITE]:** "Generally speaking, the secret to doing well in a race is staying bored as long as you can. These things usually come down to who has a little something extra left at the end, and if you're not going hard in the early stages, you've got a better chance." (https://alliedcycleworks.com/blogs/stories/big-little-sugar-bike-check)

**Cut-off Times:**

Official rule: "Cut-off times will be established for reaching each checkpoint for rider safety, based on an average of 6 mph." (https://www.bigsugarclassic.com/mtb/)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Mechanical Issues:**

**Tom Pidcock [ELITE]:** "suffered a flat tire and rolled in for a 25th-place finish" in 2023 inaugural race. (https://outdoorindustry.org/press-release/haley-batten-and-keegan-swenson-win-inaugural-life-time-little-sugar-mtb-race-to-kick-off-big-sugar-classic-week/)

**Keegan Swenson [ELITE]:** In 2025, "early puncture forced a massive chase—three minutes down after just six miles—but he still clawed his way to valuable points." (https://www.progravelmagazine.com/post/gómez-villafañe-and-jones-go-solo-at-little-sugar-mtb)

**tgoods [UNKNOWN]:** "While pre-riding this weekend I had a huge sidewall slash on my rear Mezcal." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/little-sugar-mtb/86468?page=2)

**Physical/Medical:**

**Greg Marchand [COMPETITIVE]:** "I'd been battling a bad stomach that morning, and was close to needing to pull over and handle a bit of business." Also noted he was "experiencing the onset of a physical illness that I'd learn months later was Celiac Disease." (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/little-sugar-mtb-2024)

**Cameron Jones [ELITE]:** "I cooked it a bit early and started to cramp, but it was good to have that buffer." (https://www.progravelmagazine.com/post/gómez-villafañe-and-jones-go-solo-at-little-sugar-mtb)

**General DNF Prediction:**

**jdietrich [UNKNOWN]:** "I am really anxious to see their cut off times. This being their first year I hope they are not too aggressive as I can already see a lot of DNF's." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/little-sugar-mtb/86468?page=2)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Race Week Festival:**

**Greg Marchand [COMPETITIVE]:** "At some point the conversation found its way to how much the sport had changed since we'd started doing these stupid races together. Sean told me that the Big Sugar Classic might be his last hurrah. I, being a man of more passion than reason, decided to ignore my lack of preparation and figure out how to make the drive to Arkansas. I decided I'd never forgive myself if I didn't join Sean at the start." (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/little-sugar-mtb-2024)

**Mass Participation Appeal:**

**Allied rider [ELITE]:** "It feels like every year the Grand Prix races get bigger. It's kind of wild we're only in year two with how much the series has already grown. The secret sauce of course is that they're mass participation events. It's really rewarding to get to connect with the amateur riders, share a story, take a photo, chat about a podcast episode they liked – it's really a community out there. It's still funny to me when people say we inspire them or that they look up to what we do. But it does reinforce that these events – and those of us at the front of them – can contribute to fostering others' love for the bike." (https://alliedcycleworks.com/blogs/stories/big-little-sugar-bike-check)

**2023 Inaugural Event Scale:**

"The inaugural race had more than 1,000 participants, with riders aged 12 to 70 years old from 46 states and eight countries." (https://outdoorindustry.org/press-release/haley-batten-and-keegan-swenson-win-inaugural-life-time-little-sugar-mtb-race-to-kick-off-big-sugar-classic-week/)

**Post-Race:**

"Cross that finish line and enjoy the sweet feeling of success! Join us at The HUB Bike Lounge for a party complete with bike valet, food trucks, drinks, a live DJ, awards, and so much more." Official post includes "$20 voucher" for participating venues. (https://www.bigsugarclassic.com/mtb/)

**Prize Purse:**

"Life Time and OZ Brands awarded a $65,000 prize purse equally split between the top five women and top five men finishers, the largest single-day prize purse in US mountain biking" (2023). (https://outdoorindustry.org/press-release/haley-batten-and-keegan-swenson-win-inaugural-life-time-little-sugar-mtb-race-to-kick-off-big-sugar-classic-week/)

**Location Context:**

**Allied rider [ELITE]:** "I love racing in Bentonville. The punchy climbs and rocky surfaces of both courses suit me, and starting and finishing in bike-crazed Bentonville is the best." (https://alliedcycleworks.com/blogs/stories/big-little-sugar-bike-check)
