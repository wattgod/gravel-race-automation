# LONE WOLF GRAVEL — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

The Lone Wolf Gravel Race is described as an event that "holds to the tradition of grass-root origins that helped create the popular cycling discipline" in contrast to gravel racing reaching "its zenith" with more commercialized events (https://komcycling.com/blogs/product-blogs/episode-95-the-lone-wolf-gravel-race).

**James Morrow [UNKNOWN] (Race Creator):** The race takes place during peak fall colors in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, which he describes as "A perfect fall day in dah U.P." with conditions noted as "27* in the morning, 55* in the afternoon. Partly sunny. Peak color change." Race attendance for 2022 showed "Just over 100 registered, Just under 70 showed up" (https://www.thenxrth.com/post/the-lone-wolf-sequel-2022-reroutes-peak-colors-a-perfect-day-in-dah-u-p).

The race features "one aid station on course hosted by Embark Maple with Laura the fox and her rad Dad dishing out all the maple goodness," where "every single racer who stopped definitely appreciated that" (https://www.thenxrth.com/post/the-lone-wolf-sequel-2022-reroutes-peak-colors-a-perfect-day-in-dah-u-p).

Race proceeds have been used for community benefit: "With the proceeds from the race we were able to purchase a rescue device for the fire department that will help with single track rescues in the Iron Mountain area" (https://www.thenxrth.com/post/the-lone-wolf-sequel-2022-reroutes-peak-colors-a-perfect-day-in-dah-u-p).

The event is presented by the Iron Hills Cycling Team, "a nonprofit organization that strives to promote a sense of community and support among local residents of Dickinson County and the surrounding areas through a shared passion of cycling" (https://www.upsportandspoke.com/lonewolfgravelrace).

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**James Morrow [UNKNOWN] (Race Creator):** Describes the original route as "a solid 50 mile loop of pristine, hard pack, fast gravel, accompanied by chunky steep, climbs, and rowdy descents" that he and his brother-in-law created "while searching to find as much remote gravel as possible that could be accessed from downtown Iron Mountain" (https://www.upsportandspoke.com/lonewolfgravelrace).

The race got its name from an encounter during a spring ride: "we were both bar to bar climbing out of a big trough when he looked up and whispered to me 'Wolf'-'Wolf'. At the crest of the hill trotted one of the largest gray wolves I've ever seen... As soon as we laid eyes on it, it looked over its right shoulder back at us and kept a steady trot up and over the crest" (https://www.upsportandspoke.com/lonewolfgravelrace).

For 2022, conditions were noted as "pretty dry and loose for gravel biking in the Iron Mountain area" (https://www.thenxrth.com/post/the-lone-wolf-sequel-2022-reroutes-peak-colors-a-perfect-day-in-dah-u-p).

Year 2 required significant rerouting: "With Fumee Lake area not allowing their gates to be opened for our event this year we had to do some serious recon and planning to figure out how we could bypass the area while still making the route as great as it was the first year. While also needing a new start/finish line too... We were able to reroute the course while adding 10 miles of amazing U.P. Gravel, a few miles of which are brand new thanks to the DNR" (https://www.thenxrth.com/post/the-lone-wolf-sequel-2022-reroutes-peak-colors-a-perfect-day-in-dah-u-p).

The courses are "minimally (or not at all) marked, a .gpx-compatible device is required for navigation" (https://www.upsportandspoke.com/lonewolfgravelrace).

## Weather Experienced

**2022 Race Day:** "27* in the morning, 55* in the afternoon. Partly sunny. Peak color change" with "pretty dry and loose" conditions (https://www.thenxrth.com/post/the-lone-wolf-sequel-2022-reroutes-peak-colors-a-perfect-day-in-dah-u-p).

## DNF Risk Factors

Navigation is a potential challenge as "The courses will be minimally (or not at all) marked, a .gpx-compatible device is required for navigation" (https://www.upsportandspoke.com/lonewolfgravelrace).

**James Morrow [UNKNOWN]:** "Only downfall of the race is that we had some disconnects with the manual timing and weren't able to log everyone's times. This will be our main focus to correct for next years race" — though this is an organizational issue rather than a rider DNF factor (https://www.thenxrth.com/post/the-lone-wolf-sequel-2022-reroutes-peak-colors-a-perfect-day-in-dah-u-p).
