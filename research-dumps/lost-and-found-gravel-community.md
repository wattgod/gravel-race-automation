# LOST AND FOUND GRAVEL — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Serena Gordon [ELITE]:** "I love the Lost Sierra, and I really like Portola. Just this landscape, and the way the community embraces the event, and everyone's so nice, and the festival. Lost and Found is sort of the reason we ride and race bikes, and we get to see this amazing landscape and amazing terrain, and it's really special." (https://lostandfoundbikeride.com/)

**Derek Yarra [ELITE]:** "There's a special feeling that comes with leaving the city for the mountains. A magic that hits when the buildings get sparse and the trees grow abundant, when the air gets crisp and phone reception fades away." (https://abovecategory.com/blogs/journal/100-miles-of-sierra-paydirt-racing-the-lost-and-found)

**Derek Yarra [ELITE]:** "As a life long sea-level native, altitude and I have never gotten along. Even at the modest base of 4,500ft, I was feeling the effects straight away. I've finally hit a point in life of coming to terms with this, and metered my efforts accordingly." (https://abovecategory.com/blogs/journal/100-miles-of-sierra-paydirt-racing-the-lost-and-found)

**Derek Yarra [ELITE]:** "After a long stretch of riding on a solo mission, I made it back in the race–sitting within the top 20 and on track for my goal of a sub six hour finish." (https://abovecategory.com/blogs/journal/100-miles-of-sierra-paydirt-racing-the-lost-and-found)

**Derek Yarra [ELITE]:** "The bike was unfazed, but the impact bucked my rear end up and my saddle tagged me in my tail bone, sending a jolt up my back. Not good... The next 15 miles were all washboard fire road, which did my body no favors." (https://abovecategory.com/blogs/journal/100-miles-of-sierra-paydirt-racing-the-lost-and-found)

**Derek Yarra [ELITE]:** "At the end of the day, I crossed the line 25th in the pro field with a time of 6h24m. Quite a way off from the time and placing I was hoping for and nearly an hour down from Tobin's winning time, but given the problems I had with my back, I was happy to have just finished the ride." (https://abovecategory.com/blogs/journal/100-miles-of-sierra-paydirt-racing-the-lost-and-found)

**Brent Prenzlow [ELITE]:** "I hope to follow [course designer] Chris McGovern. He probably knows every pebble out on the course." (https://www.cxmagazine.com/2014-lost-and-found-gravel-bike-ride-race-results-kessler-young)

**Aaron Barcheck [COMPETITIVE]:** "When you go out here it is pretty evident what the Trail Stewardship does. It's amazing. The race itself has a great mix of double track, dirt roads, a tiny bit of pavement and amazing views. And it's hard. Man, it's hard." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/the-grind-lost-and-found-and-reborn/?scope=anon)

**Josh Becker, Single Speed and Mustache Champion [ELITE]:** "The Raddler 44 with SG2 combined with WTB sealant is my go-to for Lost & Found. Fast rolling lowpro center tread for the pavement sections, knobby enough to get rad when that Lost Sierra dirt gets sketchy loose, and tough enough for the rowdy descents!" (https://www.wtb.com/blogs/wtb/tires-of-choice-for-lost-and-found-2025)

**lnarachi [RECREATIONAL]:** "Well - I signed up for my first gravel race, the Lost and Found gravel grinder in Northern California... Currently I run Schwalbe G-One Speed 30 mm on the carbon 700c wheels and Schwalbe Thunder Burt HS 451 2.1 inch on the alloy 650b wheels both tubeless." (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/b6apar/signed_up_for_my_first_gravel_grinder_lost_and/)

**Unattributed rider [COMPETITIVE]:** "For the moment, I am fine... Somewhere on the descent I lost my phone bunny-hopping a ditch formed by the winter run off, only realizing it was gone when I found myself in front a picturesque golden meadow of mustard and clover. It was only a mile and half back, up the climb I just dropped down with joy." (https://ritcheylogic.com/blog/for-the-moment-i-am-fine)

**Unattributed rider [COMPETITIVE]:** "At mile 60, I began doing the math on my ride time and average speed based on distance covered. Sure I have a computer for that, but these types of games keep my mind off how much everything hurt. My race soon became a negotiation my brain made with my body on how much farther it could propel my bike, if we just go a little faster, we'll be done sooner." (https://ritcheylogic.com/blog/for-the-moment-i-am-fine)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Tire Width — General Guidance:**
The official race guidance states: "This is the Sierra so plan on running wider tires with more tread. We recommend at least 40mm wide tires for cyclocross bikes (like WTB Nano 40mm tires), and riding a light, fast rigid mountain bike with 2.0 tires wouldn't be a bad choice either, especially if you are more comfortable on a mountain bike." (https://www.granfondoguide.com/Events/Popup/4711)

**Derek Yarra [ELITE] — Tire Choice:**
"The only change being a switch from the WTB Riddler 37s to Vittoria Terreno Dry 40s for that extra bit of cush." Finished in 6h24m. (https://abovecategory.com/blogs/journal/100-miles-of-sierra-paydirt-racing-the-lost-and-found)

**Josh Becker [ELITE] — Tire Choice:**
"The Raddler 44 with SG2 combined with WTB sealant is my go-to for Lost & Found." (https://www.wtb.com/blogs/wtb/tires-of-choice-for-lost-and-found-2025)

**Unattributed rider [COMPETITIVE] — Tire Choice:**
"Usually I engage in this brand of banter only to pass the time, I have my favorites and know what they're for. On the day, I rolled the WCS SpeedMax 40 for the volume, robust casing and cornering. Also, they were already mounted up on my wheels, so malaise played a crucial role in my tire choice. Lucky me, they stood up to more than a few rim bashing, rocky creek bed crossings. At least twice I heard my rim let out a painful donk in protest of my poor line choice on a descent." (https://ritcheylogic.com/blog/for-the-moment-i-am-fine)

**WTB Tire Recommendations [BRAND/GENERAL]:**
- **Resolute 700x42:** "The Resolute is a no-brainer for the front tire. With ample knob height and open spacing, it provides traction and confidence on sketchy descents, chunky climbs, and unexpected washouts." Recommended for dual setup for riders "racing for fun and not the podium" seeking "max traction and confidence."
- **Vulpine 700x40/45:** "Pair the Resolute with the fast-rolling Vulpine to optimize speed without losing grip. The slick center tread glides over smoother sections, while the side knobs hold their own when cornering or powering through loose rollers. A great rear tire for those pushing pace."
- **Raddler 700x40/44:** "Want a bit more bite without sacrificing speed? The Raddler hits that sweet spot. With its tightly packed center knobs and taller side knobs, the Raddler offers increased traction for climbing loose gravel and confidence in high-speed corners."
(https://www.wtb.com/blogs/wtb/tires-of-choice-for-lost-and-found-2025)

**Tire Pressure [GENERAL]:**
"Dial in your tire pressure for Lost and Found's mixed terrain. Lower pressures smooth out the chatter and help grip in loose-over-hardpack conditions." (https://www.wtb.com/blogs/wtb/tires-of-choice-for-lost-and-found-2025)

**Derek Yarra [ELITE] — Bike Setup:**
Rode a Mosaic race bike built by Aaron Barcheck. "At least twice I heard my rim let out a painful donk in protest of my poor line choice on a descent. Worse for wear, I made it back in once piece." (https://abovecategory.com/blogs/journal/100-miles-of-sierra-paydirt-racing-the-lost-and-found)

**Unattributed rider [COMPETITIVE] — Bike Choice:**
Rode a Ritchey Swiss Cross for the 100-mile course. (https://ritcheylogic.com/blog/for-the-moment-i-am-fine)

**Unattributed rider [COMPETITIVE] — Clothing:**
"Lightweight Summer Jersey: The weight of a jersey, paired with base layer and arm warmers helps regulate body temperature, especially when doing elevation and going in and out of tree cover."
"Wind Vest: Layerable and packable clothes are clutch. Again, it's about regulating body temp... it keeps the body protected from cold descents when you're drenched in sweat from that 3000ft climb."
"Stiff Shoes: Unlike CX where you're on and off the bike, gravel races you're almost never off the bike and having pure power output is crucial." (https://ritcheylogic.com/blog/for-the-moment-i-am-fine)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Course Surface Mix:**
"A perfect blend of pavement, dirt road, gravel road and Lost Sierra adventure." 2025 routes are described as "80% dirt" for the 100-mile, "70% dirt" for 60-mile, and "35% gravel" for 35-mile. (https://lostandfoundbikeride.com/)

**Specific Terrain Challenges:**
"There are lots of rocks and rain ruts crossing the dirt road sections in numerous spots, so when in doubt, check your speed a little." (https://www.granfondoguide.com/Events/Popup/4711)

**Derek Yarra [ELITE] — Terrain Experience:**
"As soon as the pavement ended, and the doubletrack dirt roads started, carnage ensued. Soft, sandy sections stalled unsuspecting racers, and the inevitable collisions happened."

"The next several miles of the course were a mix of descending and rolling hills."

"Pack riding on dirt roads is a rather interesting experience. The efficiency of the group is oh so necessary, but with ruts and mud pits abundant, riding wheel to wheel gets sketch pretty quick."

"The next 15 miles were all washboard fire road, which did my body no favors."

"The two of us were in no man's land for quite some time, pulling each other through the flats and up the next gravel climb until we descended down to the final rest stop where we converged with the short course and hit the final section of double track." (https://abovecategory.com/blogs/journal/100-miles-of-sierra-paydirt-racing-the-lost-and-found)

**Unattributed rider [COMPETITIVE] — Terrain Experience:**
"In the basin just North of Lake Davis, the roads became long and rolling; a profile I could ride just above tempo and make up for the lost time."

"With 25 miles to go, I felt myself finally cracking with the displeasure of one final sustained three-mile climb dragging on longer than I cared for. But as I crested the top, there opened up a long valley with a smooth dirt road tracing the boarder of lush green farm fields and old growth pine." (https://ritcheylogic.com/blog/for-the-moment-i-am-fine)

**Dixie Fire Impact [UNKNOWN, Photographer's Perspective]:**
"On July 13th, 2021, faulty fuses in PGE's high voltage lines ignited what would become the largest fire in California history. It burned 963,309 acres... I rounded a corner, looking forward to one of my favorite views to photograph, and it hit me... The massive expanse of the Dixie was torpefying to see... Yet through the matchstick vistas, a blanket of beautiful undergrowth covered the steep and unforgiving terrain. Sierra lupine, Snow Plant, Mule Ears, Coyote mint, Sulfur buckwheat, and Quincy lupine offered swathes of color." (https://theradavist.com/2025-lost-and-found)

**2014 Course [ELITE]:**
"Soft, sandy sections stalled unsuspecting racers, and the inevitable collisions happened." Ellen Sherrill crashed and had four flat tires. (https://www.cxmagazine.com/2014-lost-and-found-gravel-bike-ride-race-results-kessler-young)

**Course Changes:**
"New for this year, the rugged, rocky final descent of previous years is out, but the beauty of the course focus will remain!" "The route for 2025 will be smoother than the 2024 route (the downhill is out), but there will still be some rough bits." (https://strambecco.com/event/lost-and-found-gravel-festival/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Start Strategy [ELITE — Tobin Ortenblad]:**
Derek Yarra lined up third row back next to eventual winner Tobin Ortenblad. "Tobin would finish over an hour ahead of me, and I was fine with that." Ortenblad's winning time was referenced as approximately 5h24m (Derek finished at 6h24m, "nearly an hour down from Tobin's winning time"). (https://abovecategory.com/blogs/journal/100-miles-of-sierra-paydirt-racing-the-lost-and-found)

**Derek Yarra [ELITE] — Pacing Strategy:**
"As a life long sea-level native, altitude and I have never gotten along. Even at the modest base of 4,500ft, I was feeling the effects straight away... I settled into a pace I was comfortable with, knowing I'd (hopefully) reel people in on the descent."

"My ego bruised bit as total freds and weekend warriors appeared to sling by me despite my humble tempo. As long as I could catch my breath and keep the pace, I knew after the descent in the rollers I'd shine."

"Gradually I started picking people off, railing the corners and doing my best to float over the rocky sections. After getting the big climb over with, my lungs came around and I was feeling good powering up the shorter pitches." (https://abovecategory.com/blogs/journal/100-miles-of-sierra-paydirt-racing-the-lost-and-found)

**Derek Yarra [ELITE] — Aid Station Strategy:**
"Strategy plays a big role in these races and part of that strategy includes knowing when you can safely pass an aid station. I was feeling solid with my food and hydration levels so I decided to blow by the first big rest stop... Blasting through an aid station can save a lot of time in the long run, this allowed me to catch most of the riders ahead of me." Finished in 6h24m. (https://abovecategory.com/blogs/journal/100-miles-of-sierra-paydirt-racing-the-lost-and-found)

**Unattributed rider [COMPETITIVE] — Nutrition Strategy:**
"One can opt for a few strategies regarding food. One being carry as much as you can, and never stop unless needed. Another is hit every aid station and treat it like a Sizzler on your dad's credit card. I opted for something in between. I had a couple granola bars on me just in case, plus my guilty pleasure of sugary gummie shapes. At each aid station I grabbed a few provided bars, gulped half a bottle of water and rolled, stuffing my mouth on the exit."

"The stations were so frequent I could count on them to be my intervals for knowing when to eat - approximately every 45-60 minutes. Eating in the first part of a ride like this was way more important than the later half. Rule of thumb: eat for later, not now."

"Pro-tip: take advantage of the terrain when you eat. Got a long descent coming? Scarf a bar without the worry of choking on it because you're breathing heavy."

"Onboarding as many calories as I could without feeling bloated. Fruity granola and almond milk seem to do that trick just fine. I've done enough long dumb rides at this point to know what works for me. Eating early and often and tapering off solids to gels or blocks in for the last 20 or so miles keeps the body processing food and providing energy to starving muscles for the long haul." (https://ritcheylogic.com/blog/for-the-moment-i-am-fine)

**Unattributed rider [COMPETITIVE] — Group Riding:**
"For the better part of seven miles, I dragged this ragged group at a pace I could barely stand to the next aid station. I hardly dismounted my bike to grab another bar before remounting and leaving the group to suss out food and water."

"I tried to keep the faith, like I said, thankfully most of the climbing was done, only another 80 miles of Lost and Found's mixed and dubious terrain to navigate. For the moment, I am fine." (https://ritcheylogic.com/blog/for-the-moment-i-am-fine)

**Course Timing:**
"The race started off with a five mile neutral roll out down the highway before making the first turn into the dirt." "The course was front loaded with all the big climbing coming right out the gate with a five mile ascent." (https://abovecategory.com/blogs/journal/100-miles-of-sierra-paydirt-racing-the-lost-and-found)

**Jared Kessler [ELITE] — Motivation:**
"Kessler knew the course, knew his main competition, and had the extra motivation of some time pressure to finish the event. The next day, Kessler was scheduled to defend his title in the Auburn criterium, and didn't want to be out all day in the hot sun." (https://www.cxmagazine.com/2014-lost-and-found-gravel-bike-ride-race-results-kessler-young)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Ellen Sherrill [ELITE] — Crash and Mechanicals (2014):**
"Ellen Sherrill, the silver medalist at both the 2013 SSCXWC and 2014 Singlespeed Cyclocross Nationals Championships, was racing her Rock Lobster cyclocross bike hoping for the win, but her crash, followed by four flat tires, ended up pushing her out of contention for the Pro Women's title." (https://www.cxmagazine.com/2014-lost-and-found-gravel-bike-ride-race-results-kessler-young)

**Derek Yarra [ELITE] — Back Injury:**
"I clipped a pretty big rock at top speed. The bike was unfazed, but the impact bucked my rear end up and my saddle tagged me in my tail bone, sending a jolt up my back. Not good... The next 15 miles were all washboard fire road, which did my body no favors. Legs wanted to go, but back would not comply and I was relegated to a slow roll... Over those next several miles, group by group started passing me by. All the work I'd put in to move up in the field went down the drain. Mentally I started cracking, fearing I might not make it through the next 40 or so miles to the end." (https://abovecategory.com/blogs/journal/100-miles-of-sierra-paydirt-racing-the-lost-and-found)

**Mechanicals Observed [UNKNOWN, Photographer's Perspective]:**
"Flying downhill, catching quick vignettes of riders with mechanicals. A broken wheel, snapped chain, slipped bars. Medics crowded around someone at the base of a pine tree, applying pressure to a chin wound." (https://theradavist.com/2025-lost-and-found)

**Rim Strikes:**
"At least twice I heard my rim let out a painful donk in protest of my poor line choice on a descent." [ELITE] (https://abovecategory.com/blogs/journal/100-miles-of-sierra-paydirt-racing-the-lost-and-found)

**Altitude:**
Multiple mentions of altitude being a factor. Base elevation is 4,500ft. [ELITE and COMPETITIVE riders noted this] (https://abovecategory.com/blogs/journal/100-miles-of-sierra-paydirt-racing-the-lost-and-found)

**Start Line Crashes (2014):**
"As soon as the pavement ended, and the doubletrack dirt roads started, carnage ensued. Soft, sandy sections stalled unsuspecting racers, and the inevitable collisions happened." (https://abovecategory.com/blogs/journal/100-miles-of-sierra-paydirt-racing-the-lost-and-found)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Festival Atmosphere:**
"Come for the challenge, stay for connection... A Full Weekend of Festival Fun For Riders, Families, and Friends. Post-ride party with food, beverages, live music, and camping at the venue!" (https://lostandfoundbikeride.com/)

**Kurt Gensheimer, SBTS Spokesman:**
"Lost and Found is a way for the public to explore the remote regions of the Lost Sierra. It is also an economic driver. It is something that is important to our nonprofit. We are focused on building economically viable economies through recreation, and events is the main way to do that."

"Music, he said, is an essential part of SBTS events: 'We love to party down. It's as important as the ride.'" (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/the-grind-lost-and-found-and-reborn/?scope=anon)

**Derek Yarra [ELITE]:**
"There's a unique thing to the camaraderie of bike racing, when total strangers pull up next to each other and exchange a nod and thumbs up, knowing we're all here for the same love of fun and suffering."

"They morphed the Portola City Park into an expo center and at 5 o'clock on Friday the people were trickling in and beers were already flowing. After checking in at registration, I tried to kit up and spin to open up the legs from the drive. That plan was quickly derailed as I kept running into old friends... It's funny how quickly catching up and goofing around can take precedence over race prep but having fun is the point, right?"

"Cyclists are an extreme bunch of outdoor gear nerds. Portola opened up all of their parks to racer camping and the town was blanketed with some of the most elaborate camp set ups you've ever seen. The hype of #overlanding is real."

"I wish I could say something special happened at the finish, but I had just ridden 100+ miles by myself in a loosely meditative state. Crossing the line to the end of the ride felt paramount to opening the door to my apartment. Maybe not that mundane, but my mind was too fried to take in the accomplishment of the day. In the glow of the post ride, we shared stories about the course, pit falls, follies and just about anything as if to say, 'Don't forget this moment, or it will soon be lost.'" (https://abovecategory.com/blogs/journal/100-miles-of-sierra-paydirt-racing-the-lost-and-found)

**Unattributed rider [COMPETITIVE]:**
"With 1500 people is a lot of racers, any way you cut it. It's not every day you get world class pros and novice first timers lining up in the same place, but that's part of what makes these gravel races so spectacular. Some racing for glory, some with the simple goal of just making it to the finish line. All are welcome to line up and give it their all, and the Sierra Trials crew were pros at wrangling the crowd and keeping everyone organized."

"Volunteers are the saviors, and the aid stations, run by locals or those mutually invested, are the oasis for worn and weary travelers. A Scout troop, WTB, PAUL, Patagonia, and others were there with cold cans of Coke, sweet and savory delights, and water." (https://ritcheylogic.com/blog/for-the-moment-i-am-fine)

**John Watson [UNKNOWN, Photographer]:**
"Lost and Found is the darling of gravel. The people who put it on, the host City of Portola, the vistas, the mountains, the flowers. Everything washed over me."

"Photographing Lost and Found by Bicycle... This is back-breaking work. But it comes from a place of love. Living 1,200 miles away from the Lost Sierra means I don't attend SBTS events as often as I'd like. So this is my volunteer effort to support the cause: to stoke people's interest and help build attendance. But mainly to showcase these beautiful expanses of Public Lands that are free for everyone to recreate on!" (https://theradavist.com/2025-lost-and-found)

**Event Growth:**
"Lost and Found has grown from 200 riders its first year to an anticipated 2,000 on June 6 in its seventh year." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/the-grind-lost-and-found-and-reborn/?scope=anon)

**Portola Population Impact:**
"On a normal day, Portola, California has 2,000 people. For the weekend of the Lost and Found Gravel Grinder, the population doubles." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/the-grind-lost-and-found-and-reborn/?scope=anon)

**Post-Race:**
"In 2019, SBTS moved the start and finish of Lost and Found from Lake Davis to the tiny town of Portola. 'The town loved it, and the participants loved it, because everything is based out of one place, with camping right there on the river, and music in the park.'" (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/the-grind-lost-and-found-and-reborn/?scope=anon)

**Nonprofit Mission:**
"This race supports Sierra Buttes Trail Stewardship's Connected Communities project, with the ultimate goal of connecting 15 mountain communities to promote economic prosperity through recreation. Here is what we have done since 2003: 216 Miles of NEW trails built, 2,869 Miles of trails maintained, 3 Pro Trail Crews in 2026." (https://lostandfoundbikeride.com/)

**Economic Impact:**
"SBTS doesn't have economic impact data from Lost and Found, but SBTS overall efforts in Plumas and County Sierra County made a $1.9M economic impact in 2018. This includes paying wages to 40 part-time and full-time employees with a payroll north of $800,000." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/the-grind-lost-and-found-and-reborn/?scope=anon)
