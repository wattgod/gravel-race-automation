# LOST RIVER CLASSIC — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Race Overview & Mission

The Lost River Classic is a charity gravel race in Hardy County, West Virginia, organized by the Lost River Trails Coalition (LRTC). The event raises approximately $10,000 annually, split between trail development in Lost River State Park and the Cryptids youth mountain bike team. The race honors Jay Moglia, founder of Raw Talent Ranch and first LRTC president, who originally ran a road race by the same name in Mathias.

**2025 Route Changes:** The race underwent significant redesign for 2025, removing the most technical sections including singletrack and forest service roads in George Washington National Forest. Despite 80% of 2022-2023 riders preferring to keep these sections, organizers cited logistical challenges with medical and mechanical support in remote areas.

## Course Details

**2025 Distances:**
- Long: 85 miles, 8,500 feet elevation (increased from 72 miles/9,000 feet in previous years)
- Medium: 60 miles, 6,000 feet elevation  
- Short (Cove Mountain Loop): 28 miles

**2025 Long Route [UNKNOWN LEVEL]:** "This year's course design stretches further north and includes a lot of roads which are less commonly (or almost never, in some cases) ridden by visitors to Hardy County... The long course will increase from 72 to 85 miles, but the total elevation will decrease from 9,000 to 8,500 feet. These courses are still challenging without crossing over into true sufferfest territory for which the Lost River Classic has become known. I would rate the overall challenge to be more akin to GRUSK." (https://lostrivertrailscoalition.org/news/2025/01/18/new-lost-river-classic-routes-in-2025/)

**Key Roads (2025):** The new route extends to Kirby in southern Hampshire County and includes Rock Oak Road, Briar Lick (re-devolved to gravel from pavement), Constable Hollow, Lower Skaggs Run Road, Horn Camp Road, Lower Cove Road, and Helmick Rock. Notable climbs like Basore and Judge Rye were removed from 2025 routing. (https://lostrivertrailscoalition.org/news/2025/01/18/new-lost-river-classic-routes-in-2025/)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**[UNKNOWN LEVEL]:** "This is a very challenging event. We recommend gravel bikes with low, almost mountain bike gearing and 38mm+ tires for most riders." (https://lostrivertrailscoalition.org/lost-river-classic/)

**[UNKNOWN LEVEL]:** "The Lost River Classic route features more than 50% gravel. Some of this can be relatively rough and we recommend gravel bikes with tires at or above 36mm width. We do not recommend road bikes." (https://lostrivertrailscoalition.org/lost-river-classic/)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Historical Context [RECREATIONAL]:** The race "developed a reputation for being one of the most challenging and technical gravel races in the East" with its signature section being "incredibly difficult to manage logistically, both in terms of providing mechanical support and dealing with the potential for injury on the singletrack in George Washington National Forest." The technical sections were described as "extremely polarizing—some riders will not return or recommend the race to others." (https://lostrivertrailscoalition.org/news/2025/01/18/new-lost-river-classic-routes-in-2025/)

**Pre-2025 Course [UNKNOWN LEVEL]:** "The premier Lost River Classic route has something for everyone: gravel, pavement, singletrack, doubletrack logging roads, and private farm tracks we have been granted special permission to use... The long and medium route feature several miles of manageable singletrack and a couple of brief hike-a-bike spots." (https://www.granfondoguide.com/Events/Index/10501/lost-river-classic)

**Iconic Climbs:** Howard's Lick backside climb from Moorefield up South Branch Mountain is described as "one of West Virginia's iconic climbs, having been attempted by nearly 600 cyclists over the years" - it's "nearly 5 mile climb covers 2,000 feet of elevation at an average grade of over 8%."
