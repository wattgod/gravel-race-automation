# MAAP BEECHWORTH GRANITE CLASSIC — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Lewis Ciddor [ELITE - ultra-endurance rider for MAAP]:** "The organisers have done such a great job of fostering a really inclusive and welcoming atmosphere. (It strikes) a great balance between a really fun experience and a challenging route with super varied terrain." (https://flowmountainbike.com/post-all/beechworth-granite-classic-2025/)

**Lewis Ciddor [ELITE]:** "Forget about the usual sad tables of gels and hydration mix. Hot quesadillas, coffee, donuts and a Bridge Road cold one at the finish line. And in case that's not enough to fuel the stoke, local musicians shredding heavy guitar solos from atop roadside boulders, dualling drummers and chill hilltop DJ sets with a hilltop view set the soundtrack for the ride." (https://flowmountainbike.com/post-all/beechworth-granite-classic-2025/)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Course characteristics (official description):** "Each road brings a varied and inspiring adventure; from the winding red-clay-hard-pack and sub-alpine rainforest of Mount Stanley to the, faster than bitumen, granitic roads of Pilot and Barambogie forests and everything between." (https://www.granfondoguide.com/Events/Index/12548/beechworth-granite-classic)

**Course designer's description:** "A route designed by Australian local Cameron Bird, this course was ever-changing and striked a balance between technical, challenging and fun. It was exhilarating as it kept us on our toes and in adventure mode at every turn. Vast landscapes welcomed us as we got to traverse through private farm lanes, bush track, fire roads and some rail trails on gravel bikes."

**115km route details (2025):** "60km of gravel roads being introduced into the 115 km route alone" and "gravel around the Mount Pilot" with "grassy sections to break up the long stretches of pearly dust" as "many local farmers have put their hands up to have the course cut through their farmland."

**Route flexibility:** "The 90 and 115 km routes heading off in the same direction in the morning, before splitting off around Chiltern. This is great for riders who may not be feeling their best at the junction to choose to switch from the 115km to the 90km route if need be." Organizer Ben Kraus: "All the routes come back together for the finish, so, you might be in your last 15km, but you'll probably be riding with people who have done 115km and 90km and 45km."

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Event philosophy - Organizer Ben Kraus:** "The Granite Classic may have all the distinguishing features of a large-scale gravel race, but this event is anything but a competition. Run by the local brewery, Bridge Road Brewers, the Classic's roots stem from a social group ride which Bridge Road Brewers founder, Ben Kraus, and a set of keen locals would do each year in mid-Winter." No podiums, just good riding and good people. (https://flowmountainbike.com/post-all/beechworth-granite-classic-2025/)

**Origins - Ben Kraus:** "We'd go for a ride at the end of July on a Saturday and then come back to the Brewery and set up a cinema screen to watch the (Tour de France) Stage live in the Brewery, but have a French dinner as well." The event evolved from this local 'Tour de Beechworth' tradition. (https://flowmountainbike.com/post-all/beechworth-granite-classic-2025/)

**Friday shakedown ride atmosphere [UNKNOWN]:** "A peloton of various ages, sizes, bikes, and outfits weaved through the stunning trails of Ned Kelly's former residence – past lakes, through bush, and even passing the relocated home from the film 'The Castle'. Riders of all descriptions disappeared into the dusk, before making their way back to mission control, a.k.a the Beechworth Brewery." (https://us.knog.com/blogs/journal/beechworth-granite-classic)

**Pre-race scene [UNKNOWN]:** "Tattoo-laden, lycra clad, carbon-riding savants mix in with the casual enthusiast on their marketplace stallions – there is no room for pretentious attitudes here, only a breath of encouraging fresh air." (https://us.knog.com/blogs/journal/beechworth-granite-classic)

**On-course entertainment:** "Live band (!!!) that played groovy music" at 'The Gravel Pit' feeding station, "epic electric guitar performance and a heart thumping drum tunnel in the midst of our ride," and "DJ beats" at 'Frog Hollow' feeding station.

**2024 food shortage issue:** "Last year, some folks were unfortunate enough to miss out on food as they went by.
