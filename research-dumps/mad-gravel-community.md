# MAD GRAVEL — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Nathan Trachta [COMPETITIVE]:** "Did the Mad Gravel Hemi Hustle for Memorial Day weekend; 30 miles of washboard gravel road and single track in Elbert Colorado. This is my second time doing this event and course, and last year I lost my car keys while racing (the staff was outstanding and found them when they swept the course). This year I had a really good ride and finished 29th out of 151 riders, 5th of 24 in age group. As for time, 2:13:17, which was almost 21 minutes faster than last year. The best part about this was Mad Gravel threw a trick to me again; this time I forgot my cycling shoes and had to ride the event with my running shoes on spd pedals, so who knows what the finish time and position would have been with proper shoes on."

**Bertn05 [ELITE]:** "I used the JOIN Cycling training app as my coach... Trainingwise I did a ridiculous amount, never have I done so much, with about 330 hours on the bike before the event and a few 7-8 hour trainings but mostly a very frequent training approach... I did test rides and Mad Gravel in Colorado with them [Gravel King SS 43mm tires] and felt more comfortable than ever."

**Gaby [UNKNOWN]:** "I can't believe we're still in the car park and it's already been 10 out of 10" (https://gravelunion.cc/article/sri-lanka-the-future-of-travel-gravel)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**[ELITE] Bertn05's Setup:** BMC Kaius 01 with Rival Groupset (43/33x10-34), Reserve 40/44 wheelset with Gravel King SS 43mm tubeless (no inserts). He noted: "I put my Reserve 40/44 (cervelo home brand) wheelset on it with the Gravel King SS 43mm, a bit of a guess in the two weeks prior to unbound because previously I had 40mm Pirelli Centurato Gravel Hs on it and I was happy with those but I wasnt entire sure with the width and this years course so bought these before leaving, did test rides and Mad Gravel in Colorado with them and felt more comfortable than ever."

**[UNKNOWN] Vitus Substance:** One rider posted their "Vitus Substance: Race Ready for MadGravel Ultra 123mi" setup (https://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/comments/uzxwaq/vitus_substance_race_ready_for_madgravel_ultra/)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Course Description from Official Site:** "The three course options deliver you epic terrain, punchy climbs, quick descents, wide open spaces, and will take you back to remote and beautiful country in the Colorado Front Range and Elbert County... all these events are 100% on gravel and dirt roads! You can expect fully stocked feed zones... All Hemi distances are on 100% gravel and dirt roads. You will leave peaceful valley only feet away from the patio and headquarters. Expect a nice short climb out of the venue followed by variable terrain as you leave the area and connect to the awesome gravel roads of Elbert County. The courses are all challenging with a fair share of climbs and short quick descents, along with great wide open sections where you will be blown away (hopefully not literally) by the views."

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Airport Welcome [UNKNOWN]:** "Being whisked through fast-track security, then guided through the baggage collection and customs clearance... as we left the terminal building, we were greeted by a small troupe of local musicians. They paraded in front of us, banging drums, singing and dancing as they led us into the car park... even as the dance troupe were doing incredibly impressive hand-springs across our bit of the car park, a mobile chef was busy preparing our lunch on a gas fired grill, while his assistants chopped the top off a fresh coconut and handed them to everyone." (https://gravelunion.cc/article/sri-lanka-the-future-of-travel-gravel)

**Post-Race Experience:** "You can expect fully stocked feed zones, custom swag, post-race BBQ (Sunday), live band and killer awards ceremony on the huge deck overlooking the venue. For those of you that want to just relax and spectate, Mad Gravel is an excellent race for that too. Hang out on the large deck and watch from above as you watch racers finish. You can also see them approaching from afar." (https://www.madgravel.com/)

**Family-Friendly:** "Bring the family, camp, and join us for some amazing racing, live music, daily award ceremonies, cycling tours and kids events." (https://www.madgravel.com/)

**Staff Quality [COMPETITIVE]:** Nathan noted: "the staff was outstanding and found them [my lost car keys] when they swept the course" (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/nathans-story-mad-gravel-hemi-hustle)

**Event Philosophy:** "Why go west?! ...For you Front Rangers of Colorado, driving east is a lot easier on your sanity than heading to the mountains." The event description emphasizes: "It's just not worth taking chances" in their safety messaging. (https://www.madgravel.com/)

**Camping & Venue:** "Located south of Kiowa, Colorado, come enjoy the amazing views and high peaks of the Colorado front range... great camping options Friday, Saturday and Sunday night at the McNeil Ranch at Peaceful Valley... All races will start and finish in front of the dining hall at McNeil Scout Ranch at Peaceful Valley." (https://www.madgravel.com/)
