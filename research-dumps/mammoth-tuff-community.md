# MAMMOTH TUFF — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Dave Malwitz [UNKNOWN]:** "What makes Mammoth Tuff deceivingly difficult is its unique set of challenges: the starting altitude of 8,000 feet, long stretches of sandy and loose terrain, and the near absence of course markings. Riders are well warned to rely on their own navigation rather than following the course blindly." (https://www.gravelstoke.com/gravel-cycling-gear-blog/mammoth-tuff-2024-through-sand-and-sky)

**Dave Malwitz [UNKNOWN]:** "That first year, my buddy Danny and I tackled the TUFFER course—80 miles and 5,000 feet of climbing that, on paper, seemed reasonable. However, the combination of high elevation, loose gravel, and unrelenting wind quickly redefined my sense of 'tuff'." (https://www.gravelstoke.com/gravel-cycling-gear-blog/mammoth-tuff-2024-through-sand-and-sky)

**Niky Taylor [ELITE]:** "I'd just caught Kristina when my second bottle on my fork fell out, and I stopped for it since I had already lost one. I realized that the bolts on my fork were rattling loose and I had lost two, hence why I kept dropping bottles." (https://www.altovelo.org/blog/2022-mammoth-tuff)

**Niky Taylor [ELITE]:** "Possibly the most successful thing I've ever done in a race" — regarding organizing a rotating paceline with other riders on a road section around mile 19. (https://www.altovelo.org/blog/2022-mammoth-tuff)

**Niky Taylor [ELITE]:** "This was probably the most frustrated I was during the whole course, because the washboard just made it impossible to pedal smoothly or eat or drink." — describing miles 40-55 of sandy, washboarded terrain. (https://www.altovelo.org/blog/2022-mammoth-tuff)

**Niky Taylor [ELITE]:** "It was amazing how I went from tired but fine to totally spent in the span of about 6 miles" — after hitting a headwind on pavement at mile 88-93. (https://www.altovelo.org/blog/2022-mammoth-tuff)

**Amanda Nauman [ELITE], Co-Creator:** "If you've ridden through pumice before, you know it mimics the feel of sand in areas because of how light and airy the material is." (https://puregravel.com/blogs/reviews/mammoth-tuff-taming-volcanic-gravel-and-embracing-high-altitude-cycling)

**Amanda Nauman [ELITE]:** "Everyone will be operating at a lower capacity than normal at altitude, and it's okay to accept that fact. Don't get down because you feel like you're slower because everyone else will be feeling it too!" (https://puregravel.com/blogs/reviews/mammoth-tuff-taming-volcanic-gravel-and-embracing-high-altitude-cycling)

**Amanda Nauman [ELITE]:** "In each of the three distances at Mammoth TUFF, one feature that ties them all together is that the first half of the ride is primarily descending and the second half of the ride is primarily climbing back to town. Because of this, it's often easy to forget to eat and drink while you're having a blast in the downhill sections and it will come back to haunt you on the way back to the finish." (https://puregravel.com/blogs/reviews/mammoth-tuff-taming-volcanic-gravel-and-embracing-high-altitude-cycling)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Tires - Wide and Knobby Required:**
- **Dave Malwitz [UNKNOWN]:** Rode Soma Cazadero 700x50 tires with Orange Seal Endurance on Revel carbon wheels. Noted "The Revel titanium frame does an excellent job at smoothing out rough terrain, while the wider tires helped me float across many sandy sections." (https://www.gravelstoke.com/gravel-cycling-gear-blog/mammoth-tuff-2024-through-sand-and-sky)

- **Amanda Nauman [ELITE]:** "We recommend the widest tire you can fit in your frame and comfortably ride." Her personal favorites include "Rene Herse's 700x 42 Hurricane Ridge, 44 Manastash Ridge, 44 Corkscrew Climb TC Semi-Slick or 48 Oracle Ridge." (https://puregravel.com/blogs/reviews/mammoth-tuff-taming-volcanic-gravel-and-embracing-high-altitude-cycling)

- **Official FAQ [UNKNOWN]:** "As wide as your frame will allow! 38's will suffice, but we recommend 40 and above. The more surface area you have, the better. Knobby tires that roll well are recommended." (https://www.tuff.ventures/mtuff/info)

**Gearing - Easier Than Road:**
- **Official FAQ [UNKNOWN]:** "If 2x we recommend something like a Shimano GRX crankset, or similar, with a 48/31 tooth chainrings and a 11-34 cassette. If 1x we recommend a 40 tooth chainring with at least a 11-40 cassette but an 11-46 would be better. *Note: We are saying a 1:1 ratio or easier. It is a long day at altitude." (https://www.tuff.ventures/mtuff/info)

- **Dave Malwitz [UNKNOWN]:** Rode "42t chainring and 10-44 cassette" SRAM Force XPLR eTap AXS groupset. (https://www.gravelstoke.com/gravel-cycling-gear-blog/mammoth-tuff-2024-through-sand-and-sky)

**Hydration Capacity:**
- **Official FAQ [UNKNOWN]:** "It is recommended you carry a pack or some sort of bags on your frame, bars, etc. that allow you to carry a minimum of 2 Liters (67OZ) of fluids, 4hrs of nutrition, and extra clothing." (https://www.tuff.ventures/mtuff/info)

- **Niky Taylor [ELITE]:** Started with 4 bottles but lost two from fork mounts due to rattling bolts coming loose. Had issues with fork bottle cages on rough terrain. (https://www.altovelo.org/blog/2022-mammoth-tuff)

**Bike Setup:**
- **Dave Malwitz [UNKNOWN]:** Revel R+ Titanium frame, noting the titanium "does an excellent job at smoothing out rough terrain." Used Topo Designs Top Tube Bag, small Topo handlebar bag, and Outershell Saddle Bag. Wahoo Roam GPS unit for navigation. (https://www.gravelstoke.com/gravel-cycling-gear-blog/mammoth-tuff-2024-through-sand-and-sky)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Course Profile:**
- **Niky Taylor [ELITE] - 2022 TUFFEST (107 miles):** "About 30% of the course was paved road, 70% was dirt/gravel road. Sand and washboard were major themes. The course started in Mammoth (about 6500ft altitude) with a 5 mile neutral roll out and went towards Bishop, overall descending into the valley for the first 55ish miles. The last 52ish miles involved climbing back up to Mammoth. Overall the elevation gain was about 8000ft for the whole course." (https://www.altovelo.org/blog/2022-mammoth-tuff)

- **UCI Course Description [UNKNOWN] - 89 mile course:** "63% of the course is gravel, 37% paved." First 5 miles paved, followed by gravel miles 5-16, then paved miles 16-31 going east to the lowest point. Second half back to finish is mixed gravel and asphalt. (https://ucigravelworldseries.com/en/mammoth/)

**Specific Challenging Sections:**

- **Miles 40-60 Washboard Hell:** **Niky Taylor [ELITE]:** "Somewhere around mile 40 and began to flatten out, but it was completely washboarded and still pretty sandy. Thus began what would be about 20 miles of choosing between washboard and sand or both... the washboard just made it impossible to pedal smoothly or eat or drink." (https://www.altovelo.org/blog/2022-mammoth-tuff)

- **Mile 68+ Main Climb:** **Niky Taylor [ELITE]:** "The climb was about 2500ft over 8 miles" starting around mile 68. (https://www.altovelo.org/blog/2022-mammoth-tuff)

- **Mile 40 Major Descent:** **Niky Taylor [ELITE]:** "We hit the major descent around mile 40... She rocketed down the -12% sandy gravelly slope. I followed, nearly crashing in some sand but managing to keep it together." (https://www.altovelo.org/blog/2022-mammoth-tuff)

- **Mile 83 Sand Pit Descent:** **Niky Taylor [ELITE]:** "At mile 83 I hit a descent. It was incredibly sandy, and it started with a short -16% section. I somehow managed to slip and slide my way down without falling, then continued through essentially a 3 mile sand pit. I was super stoked that I was able to ride it all, and I passed several people who were walking their bikes through the worst of it." (https://www.altovelo.org/blog/2022-mammoth-tuff)

- **Red Rock Canyon Climb:** **UCI Description [UNKNOWN]:** "The hardest part of the course comes right after the halfway point where riders start a 16 miles climb at 4.3% average with especially the narrow Red Rock Canyon climb between 52-54 miles." (https://ucigravelworldseries.com/en/mammoth/)

**Volcanic Terrain:**
- **Amanda Nauman [ELITE]:** "Pumice stone is prevalent on the forest roads and it is a relatively soft, porous rock that is usually formed by the compaction and cementation of volcanic ash or dust... it mimics the feel of sand in areas because of how light and airy the material is." (https://puregravel.com/blogs/reviews/mammoth-tuff-taming-volcanic-gravel-and-embracing-high-altitude-cycling)

**Navigation:**
- **Dave Malwitz [UNKNOWN]:** "The near absence of course markings. Riders are well warned to rely on their own navigation rather than following the course blindly. Even the shorter TUFF course demanded full attention and preparation, as one mistake could easily lead to getting lost in the maze of forest roads." (https://www.gravelstoke.com/gravel-cycling-gear-blog/mammoth-tuff-2024-through-sand-and-sky)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Altitude Management - ALL LEVELS:**
- **Amanda Nauman [ELITE]:** "The best suggestion is to lower your expectations of power output and fitness capabilities. Everyone will be operating at a lower capacity than normal at altitude, and it's okay to accept that fact." (https://puregravel.com/blogs/reviews/mammoth-tuff-taming-volcanic-gravel-and-embracing-high-altitude-cycling)

**Aid Station Strategy:**

- **Aid Station Locations (107 mile course):** **Niky Taylor [ELITE]:** "There were aid stations at 55 miles, 78 miles, and 98 miles. Each was fully stocked with water and nutrition, and the station at mile 55 included a drop bag that we had each pre-packed." (https://www.altovelo.org/blog/2022-mammoth-tuff)

- **TIME WARNING - [ELITE] level:** **Niky Taylor & Kristina [ELITE]:** At mile 55, they spent "about half an hour re-packing snacks, re-organizing kit, adjusting hydration, using the bathroom." They noted: "If we had been more serious about racing, this is the moment where we lost the race (well, where we lost third place) because both Charity and Sam had rolled up with Kristina and then taken off again quickly." Completed first 55 miles in 3 hours but acknowledged it was "the 'easy' 55 miles." (https://www.altovelo.org/blog/2022-mammoth-tuff)

**Nutrition Timing:**
- **Amanda Nauman [ELITE]:** "The first half of the ride is primarily descending and the second half of the ride is primarily climbing back to town. Because of this, it's often easy to forget to eat and drink while you're having a blast in the downhill sections and it will come back to haunt you on the way back to the finish. Make a plan and set reminders for yourself." (https://puregravel.com/blogs/reviews/mammoth-tuff-taming-volcanic-gravel-and-embracing-high-altitude-cycling)

- **Niky Taylor [ELITE]:** Around mile 30, "I was feeling a bit off and realized I hadn't eaten anything." Later: "I tried to eat something but the road was so bumpy it was still really difficult" during the washboard sections. (https://www.altovelo.org/blog/2022-mammoth-tuff)

**Drafting Strategy:**
- **Niky Taylor [ELITE]:** "I started to realize how effective drafting still was even though we were on dirt" around mile 10-19. Successfully organized rotating paceline on paved sections. Later: "Andres was hugely helpful both for moral support and for letting us draft him" during the final headwind sections. (https://www.altovelo.org/blog/2022-mammoth-tuff)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Mechanical Issues:**
- **Bottle Cage Failures:** **Niky Taylor [ELITE]:** "The bolts on my fork were rattling loose and I had lost two, hence why I kept dropping bottles." Lost two bottles during the race. (https://www.altovelo.org/blog/2022-mammoth-tuff)

- **Flats at Start:** **Niky Taylor [ELITE]:** "As soon as we rolled up, I realized my back tire was flat because my valve stem had rattled loose... I saw several other riders get flats or mechanicals within the first 5 miles." (https://www.altovelo.org/blog/2022-mammoth-tuff)

- **Chain Drops:** **Niky Taylor [ELITE]:** Multiple mentions of riders dropping chains on descents - "Kendall dropped his chain... Kendall caught up to me but dropped his chain again." (https://www.altovelo.org/blog/2022-mammoth-tuff)

**Bonking Risk:**
- **Niky Taylor [ELITE]:** Met rider Andres who "had some mechanicals and was set back so much he'd bonked after catching back on. So he recovered and then decided to just have a good time and hang out with people." (https://www.altovelo.org/blog/2022-mammoth-tuff)

**Navigation Risk:**
- **Dave Malwitz [UNKNOWN]:** "The near absence of course markings... one mistake could easily lead to getting lost in the maze of forest roads." (https://www.gravelstoke.com/gravel-cycling-gear-blog/mammoth-tuff-2024-through-sand-and-sky)

- **Niky Taylor [ELITE]:** "At mile 30 we turned back onto gravel. Albert and Kendall missed the turn so we had to shout at them to come back." (https://www.altovelo.org/blog/2022-mammoth-tuff)
