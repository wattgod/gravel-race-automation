# MARJI GESICK — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Carl Jarema [ELITE]:** "Everything about this race is weird and unconventional! Marji Gesick really is a 365 day event. Registration sells out in minutes, there is not waitlist, and the intentional misinformation, confusion, and tom foolery from the race organizers and fellow participants is nonstop to race day." (https://teamrunrun.com/marji-gesick-100/)

**Carl Jarema [ELITE]:** "I completed the Marji Gesick 100 in 2023 in a little over 39 hours. Yes, it was my first 100 mile race, but I knew I had much more potential... This time, I was able to train very well heading into the race, and my nutrition and hydration were dialed. I ran way more of this race than I have in other 100 milers, and I finished in time to earn my belt buckle, awarded to runners under 28 hours." Finished in 26 hours, 3rd overall. (https://teamrunrun.com/marji-gesick-100/)

**Carl Jarema [ELITE]:** "The back half of the race is more technical and harder to run. I recommend banking some time in the first 60 miles, if possible, but don't over do it." (https://teamrunrun.com/marji-gesick-100/)

**Andrea Larson [COMPETITIVE]:** "The epiphany I had mid-race was that my fear was the biggest challenge of completing the Marji Gesick 200... In fact, there were several early descents where I had both wheels locked up skidding hoping I'd regain control before I rammed into a rock, root, or tree. The intensity of each descent would not be sustainable. Since scouting over Labor Day weekend on the trails, it had been dry; however, if this was the culprit, I feared how loose it would be on my return trip after several hundred riders ripped up the trail. Luckily as I relaxed, I didn't have this problem later on." (https://www.ironbull.org/blog/marji-2024a)

**Andrea Larson [COMPETITIVE]:** "I found the limits of my bike shoes…and I destroyed them! Risk management was my motto of the day(s). In fact, I expressed it out loud dozens of times during the race and silently even more frequently as I justified dismounting time and time again. I likely dismounted hundreds of times, and to prove it I wore out my brand new cleats that I broke in just for the event…well before the finish line. But I managed finishing Marji without a drop of blood!" (https://www.ironbull.org/blog/marji-2024a)

**Andrea Larson [COMPETITIVE]:** "I estimated that I took a bottle with 60 grams of protein 12 times in a day-and-a-half. Yes, that math says I drank nearly ten times the recommended daily dose of protein. And my legs (and arms) felt no fatigue over that time." (https://www.ironbull.org/blog/marji-2024a)

**Heath Paukette [ELITE]:** "Anyone that has heard of the Marji know it's one of the hardest single-day mountain bike races in the States. Rocks, roots, minimal trail flow, big climbs, treacherous descents...the finishing rate can vary between 25% to 65%, depending on the weather and trail conditions." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/heaths-story-marji-gesick)

**Heath Paukette [ELITE]:** "My GI issues have somewhat subsided, but the prior 5 hours of minimal fueling has put me in a major deficit. We can hear the finish line and a band playing below us as we continue to climb up what's known as the luge climb... I don't know how many times I apologized, but he finally had to tell me we made a pact and he's going to be there for me no matter what." Finished at approximately 17+ hours. (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/heaths-story-marji-gesick)

**RLP Coaching blog author [ELITE]:** "Registration for next year's event opened last Saturday at 9:06 PM and sold out in under a minute. When I say 'sold out,' I mean that the website bikereg.com crashed due to the sheer number of people trying to register simultaneously." (https://www.rlp-coaching.com/blog/read_206695/my-marji-gesick-experience-2024-part-1-the-run-in-to-the-race.html)

**RLP Coaching blog author [ELITE]:** "I came across wooden ramps and rollers—things that would soon be vandalized and burned to ashes back in the UK. Then, I spot a huge jump spot. As I roll into the city, which boasts a population of around 20,000, I pass three bike shops on my way to my first coffee stop... I leave my bike outside, which seems to be the norm here, and I probably won't need to lock it—interesting!" (https://www.rlp-coaching.com/blog/read_206695/my-marji-gesick-experience-2024-part-1-the-run-in-to-the-race.html)

**c0nsumer [UNKNOWN]:** "DNF'd at mile 84. Good day, but I was done... Sun was about to drop, I was getting cold, and I'd stopped having fun about 45 minutes prior. It was a good day, and I'm happy with the choice... My chest was getting sore as I breathed, and I was feeling a bit lightheaded and spacey. Couldn't bring myself to ride some technical stuff that I'd done previously, even before the sun was set." (https://www.reddit.com/r/MTB/comments/9i8d7o/marji_gesick_100_howd_your_race_go/)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Carl Jarema [ELITE] - Running Gear:** "A waist light is a must. I did have a waist light, but I didn't plan a better way to attach it to my belt. I could have moved better at night if I had better lighting." (https://teamrunrun.com/marji-gesick-100/)

**Carl Jarema [ELITE] - Running Gear:** "The Marji Gesick 100 is not a mountain race, but I did find my poles to be helpful." (https://teamrunrun.com/marji-gesick-100/)

**Andrea Larson [COMPETITIVE] - Bike Setup:** "The dropper post was invaluable but between fearing the grit from the rain would seize it up and worrying my thumb may get too sore to activate it later in the race, I didn't use it as much mid-race as I could have. Regardless, I was far less fatigued than when I scouted the trails a few weeks earlier without a dropper post." (https://www.ironbull.org/blog/marji-2024a)

**Andrea Larson [COMPETITIVE] - Bike Setup:** "I first raced this event on a steel hardtail with no dropper; last year I rode a 120/120mm bike with 2.4" knobby tires, 180mm rotors. Relative to the course changes and distance, I now ride faster than I used to. Comfort, control and confidence are key." (https://www.ironbull.org/blog/marji-2024a)

**Andrea Larson [COMPETITIVE] - Hydration Strategy:** "I intentionally chose not to wear a pack. Even though there was potential of bottles rattling out of the cages (which never did), I saw several advantages of no pack which proved useful during the event: 1) less back fatigue, since I used to get a sore back on long rides and especially since I hadn't conditioned my body for long rides 2) heat dissipation, which was vital for day 2 when temperatures approached record highs in the mid-80s, and 3) less opportunity for getting clammy and cold overnight." (https://www.ironbull.org/blog/marji-2024a)

**Andrea Larson [COMPETITIVE] - Footwear:** "I considered using my running shoes and Power Grips I use for all adventure races, but opted to dig up my first pair of bike shoes out of the attic. After sitting for 12 years, I dumped out mouse poop and squeezed them on like one of Cinderella's stepsisters... I wore out my brand new cleats that I broke in just for the event…well before the finish line." (https://www.ironbull.org/blog/marji-2024a)

**Matt Acker [COMPETITIVE] - Tire Choice:** "I ditch my more svelte tires in favor of 800+ gram durable casing downcountry/enduro treads. Do they roll as fast as I'd like on the ski trail and bike path? No. Do they grip when I need them to in the sketchy RAMBA trails? You bet they do... The average speed for the winner is always around 10 mph. Think of that for a second. That skinsuit, aero hydration pack and slick helmet don't do much at those speeds." (https://www.salsacycles.com/blogs/articles/8-tips-for-thriving-not-just-surviving-at-marji-gesick)

**Matt Acker [COMPETITIVE] - Bike Choice:** "I first raced this event on a steel hardtail with no dropper; last year I rode a 120/120mm bike with 2.4" knobby tires, 180mm rotors. Relative to the course changes and distance, I now ride faster than I used to. Comfort, control and confidence are key. That 60mm rear travel XC race rocket that's 4 pounds lighter than your 120mm travel trail machine is probably not worth the trade-off." (https://www.salsacycles.com/blogs/articles/8-tips-for-thriving-not-just-surviving-at-marji-gesick)

**Jill Martindale [COMPETITIVE] - Lighting:** "Get used to riding in the dark and the transition from daylight to darkness. Practice strapping lights to your bike and your helmet, positioning them, making sure they don't rattle loose, and turning them on and off. Nothing is more frustrating than your light rattling loose on a bumpy descent or being sleep-deprived and forgetting mid-race that the light's safety lock is on. Finally, get used to riding with the weight of a light on your helmet — it's often overlooked, but it can cause neck pain hours into the dark." (https://www.salsacycles.com/blogs/articles/8-tips-for-thriving-not-just-surviving-at-marji-gesick)

**Jill Martindale [COMPETITIVE] - Bike Choice:** "Finishing the 100-mile Marji Gesick in 2023 on a single-speed Timberjack was hard but a great confidence boost for racing the 200-mile on a lush and comfortable Spearfish with gears! How nice!" (https://www.salsacycles.com/blogs/articles/8-tips-for-thriving-not-just-surviving-at-marji-gesick)

**c0nsumer [UNKNOWN]:** "My nutrition plan was solid (Infinit + outside food), Garmin charging went as expected, and lights were as they needed to be." (https://www.reddit.com/r/MTB/comments/9i8d7o/marji_gesick_100_howd_your_race_go/)

## Weather Experienced

**Carl Jarema [ELITE] - 2025 Run:** "This year, the temperature was in mid 60s to low 70s, with sun during the day for the run. Saturday afternoon and evening, rainstorms came in and soaked many runners and bikers still on course." (https://teamrunrun.com/marji-gesick-100/)

**Carl Jarema [ELITE] - General conditions:** "The race happens on the shore of Lake Superior, it can go from 70 and sunny to 40 and rain in minutes." (https://teamrunrun.com/marji-gesick-100/)

**Andrea Larson [COMPETITIVE] - 2024 Bike (200-mile):** "Temperatures approached record highs in the mid-80s" on day 2. (https://www.ironbull.org/blog/marji-2024a)

**Heath Paukette [ELITE] - 2023 Bike:** "Starting temp in the mid 50s F with highs throughout the day in the upper 60s and no rain. It's a LeMans start, where we have to run a 1/2 mile to get to our bikes and then start the ride." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/heaths-story-marji-gesick)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Carl Jarema [ELITE] - 100-mile run course:** "The course is harder than the elevation profile will show. The course is much more like an east coast trail: rocks, roots, and punchy climbs. No climb is terribly long, but they just keep coming. Be ready for a tough go at the end of race. This years Marji Gesick 100 race was closer to 110 miles with over 13,000 feet of elevation!" (https://teamrunrun.com/marji-gesick-100/)

**Carl Jarema [ELITE]:** "The first half of the race has pretty good flow to it, however, after mile 60, there are a lot of technical trails with short, but very punchy climbs." (https://teamrunrun.com/marji-gesick-100/)

**Carl Jarema [ELITE]:** "Don't forget, the race will probably be somewhere between 100 and 110 miles, so don't get discouraged when you cross 100 miles on your watch and there is still and hour or two left to go in the race." (https://teamrunrun.com/marji-gesick-100/)

**Andrea Larson [COMPETITIVE]:** "Most of my falls were embarrassingly during the hike-a-bike. After my second near fall on an uphill where I tried to save myself by grabbing a tree, I decided it would probably just be safer and expend less energy to fall. Each time I ended up with road rash as I wrapped myself around a tree…if only the trees could talk!" (https://www.ironbull.org/blog/marji-2024a)

**Heath Paukette [ELITE]:** "The first black diamond section 6 miles in... it's basically a massive rock that everyone has to hike a bike up and down. The best thing about this spot is the bagpiper at the top playing. What a way to start the morning." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/heaths-story-marji-gesick)

**Heath Paukette [ELITE] on RAMBA trails:** "By now we have 65ish miles on our legs and about 6k feet of climbing. In the next 40 miles, we'll tack on an additional 7k feet of climbing with the most Godforsaken hand-built trails anywhere. There is no free trail where we are going." Starting around mile 65-70. (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/heaths-story-marji-gesick)

**Heath Paukette [ELITE] on the Luge climb:** "We can hear the finish line and a band playing below us as we continue to climb up what's known as the luge climb. Man, I just want to be down there with a beer in my hand instead of pushing this 30lb bike." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/heaths-story-marji-gesick)

**RLP Coaching blog author [ELITE]:** "The first climb is nearly too steep for me on a single-speed bike and requires a lot of standing up. However, the gravel is so deep and loose that standing up provides no traction at all, forcing me to walk. I tell myself it's all due to the weight of my bag, but I know I'm just kidding myself." On the 50-mile course. (https://www.rlp-coaching.com/blog/read_206695/my-marji-gesick-experience-2024-part-1-the-run-in-to-the-race.html)

**RLP Coaching blog author [ELITE]:** "Most of the next 15 miles consisted of technical singletrack. While it wasn't overly challenging, there were some tricky moments. The remaining sections included some sandy traps, followed by a long, flat cycle path." (https://www.rlp-coaching.com/blog/read_206695/my-marji-gesick-experience-2024-part-1-the-run-in-to-the-race.html)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Carl Jarema [ELITE] - 26-hour 100-mile run finisher:** "I think I would add more crew stops. We planned on about every 10 miles, and during the afternoon, I was running out of water between stops and had to slow down a bit. I noticed runners with more stops were moving a bit better and faster during the warmer part of the day. I also would try to limit my stop time a little more. We had a hard cap of 10 minutes max at any stop. I think in the future I would try to limit that to 5 minutes." (https://teamrunrun.com/marji-gesick-100/)

**Andrea Larson [COMPETITIVE] - 200-mile bike finisher:** "My goal was to have my bottles empty each time I met my crew" for liquid calorie consumption. "I usually consume about half my calories as liquids for ultra runs, so I planned to consume 500 liquid calories contained in two bottles on my bike frame every few hours." (https://www.ironbull.org/blog/marji-2024a)

**Andrea Larson [COMPETITIVE]:** "Caffeine has been shown to improve reaction time by 10%, endurance by 2-5%, and power by 3-8%, with the ideal dose about 300-500mg. I simply took caffeine during night sections to proactively stay alert and gain an edge. Since I normally don't consume any caffeine, I tend to err on the side of caution, so I usually don't take caffeine more than I think is necessary." (https://www.ironbull.org/blog/marji-2024a)

**Andrea Larson [COMPETITIVE]:** "On my unsupported running FKTs, I chose the most calorie dense foods. During long runs and adventure races when I don't navigate I often eat foods to stave off boredom, such as individual M&Ms, peanuts, or gummies. Since I don't have good balance on a bike and don't trust myself to ride without hands, granola bars and cookies in pre-opened packages that I could slide a mouthful in at a time was the way to go." (https://www.ironbull.org/blog/marji-2024a)

**Heath Paukette [ELITE] - ~17-hour bike finisher:** "We had a plan of substantial carbs early and keeping up on the sodium and hydration throughout the day. I had never felt better training on the bike... We hit our first SAG stop around 2 1/2 hours in, refill bottles and food, and roll out feeling strong." Working with a nutrition coach, Namrita Brooke. (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/heaths-story-marji-gesick)

**Heath Paukette [ELITE]:** "About 6 hours in we hit our 3rd SAG stop. Fueling still on point, both of us feeling strong. Kris cooks up a quick tortilla for Chad, and we're off." Then at 9.5 hours: "We both eat some solid food (tortillas with potatoes and cheese), change socks and gloves, refill bottles, etc." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/heaths-story-marji-gesick)

**Heath Paukette [ELITE] on fueling failure:** "We're about 30 minutes since our SAG stop and I start to encounter GI issues. My stomach just couldn't handle all the carbs that had been coming at it over the last 10 hours. I couldn't eat nor take in any more superfuel... The prior 5 hours of minimal fueling has put me in a major deficit." Started around 10 hours into the race. (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/heaths-story-marji-gesick)

**Matt Acker [COMPETITIVE]:** "Don't get caught up in the frenzy of the start. I hear from a lot of people that their plan is to 'put in some effort so I don't get caught behind people that can't ride the singletrack.' But when that's everyone's plan, they all try to ride faster than everyone else, and pretty soon the whole race feels like a one-hour short-track event. My best advice is telling people to just stick to their pace from the gun even if it means they may get stuck early on having to walk stuff they could ride. That saved energy can be used later on when the race really begins to get tough in RAMBA trails." (https://www.salsacycles.com/blogs/articles/8-tips-for-thriving-not-just-surviving-at-marji-gesick)

**Matt Acker [COMPETITIVE]:** "Break the big challenge down into small chunks and take them one at a time. The many unique sections of the Marji Gesick course are perfect for this approach. My trick is to think of each trail zone as its own ride and then check each one off as I complete it before thinking about what comes next." (https://www.salsacycles.com/blogs/articles/8-tips-for-thriving-not-just-surviving-at-marji-gesick)

**Jill Martindale [COMPETITIVE]:** "If you want to quit because you're tired, you're hungry, you're cranky, or it's dark, just give it a little time. Eat a snack, close your eyes for 15 minutes, remember that it was fun for a while and it'll get fun again soon." (https://www.salsacycles.com/blogs/articles/8-tips-for-thriving-not-just-surviving-at-marji-gesick)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Carl Jarema [ELITE]:** "Make sure you are keeping your head up and don't miss the pumpkins! Don't worry, they are not hidden like the books in the Barkley Marathons, but as the race goes on, you could miss one in a sleep deprived state." Missing checkpoint tokens can result in DQ or having to go back on course. (https://teamrunrun.com/marji-gesick-100/)

**Andrea Larson [COMPETITIVE]:** "I ended up riding most of the race solo under the most bizarre circumstances... the unimaginable happened: the lone remaining rider rolled behind me to announce he'd be leaving me to stop for a coffee. I couldn't believe my ears. It was noon, are there really coffee addicts that must stop for a coffee in the middle of the day in a race? I ended up riding until dark by myself with the only time I saw any other riders was a rider lying in the middle of the non-technical snowmobile trail with a broken collarbone." (https://www.ironbull.org/blog/marji-2024a)

**Heath Paukette [ELITE]:** "One of their hashtags is 'Find your limits and destroy them,' and you definitely will during your time out there... The finishing rate can vary between 25% to 65%, depending on the weather and trail conditions." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/heaths-story-marji-gesick)

**Heath Paukette [ELITE]:** "This year, just to mess with us, the first checkpoint was an atomic fireball (yes the round cinnamon candy). Chad popped one in his mouth, but I was on to the shenanigans and told him to grab one extra just in case we needed to turn it it." Checkpoint confusion can lead to DQ. (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/heaths-story-marji-gesick)

**Heath Paukette [ELITE]:** "At one point, my front tire catches a root and slings me to the left into a 6 foot hole. Somehow I grab a hold of a tree with my left hand while holding onto my bike with my right hand. Chad comes to the rescue, not for the last time, and grabs my bike and wondering how in the hell I ended up in that position." During night riding in technical sections. (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/heaths-story-marji-gesick)

**c0nsumer [UNKNOWN]:** "DNF'd at mile 84... My chest was getting sore as I breathed, and I was feeling a bit lightheaded and spacey. Couldn't bring myself to ride some technical stuff that I'd done previously, even before the sun was set. Knowing I had about 25 miles left, and what much of the last bit contained, I called it." DNF due to physical/mental fatigue before nightfall. (https://www.reddit.com/r/MTB/comments/9i8d7o/marji_gesick_100_howd_your_race_go/)

**906AT Official race info [UNKNOWN]:** "If you get to the finish line without any of the required tokens we'll DQ ya... Yes, GPS is required. It's been required since day one. Is the course marked? Yes, but as we have said from day one: signs fall down, people tear them down, and da bears will eat them. Don't blame us if you show up unprepared and can't finish the event because you don't know how to navigate." (https://906adventureteam.com/marji-gesick-blog/)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Carl Jarema [ELITE]:** "The Marji Gesick 100 is self- / community-supported race, and it was fun and exciting to interact with all the other runner crews. They always offered water, food, or any assistance, really highlighting one of the aspects that makes trail and ultra such a special community." (https://teamrunrun.com/marji-gesick-100/)

**Carl Jarema [ELITE] on bike traffic during the run:** "The mountain bike race, which starts 24 hours after the run, is on the same trails, so depending on your pace and time, you may need to step aside or navigate the bikers as they pass. It is not all bad though. Based on my 2023 experience, every bike rider cheered and encouraged me along the route." (https://teamrunrun.com/marji-gesick-100/)

**Carl Jarema [ELITE] on race organization quirks:** "Check out 'Marji Gesick Talks' on Facebook, and you will understand. The 100 mile run starts with a 0.5 to 0.75 mile bike ride. Yes, you need to bring a bike to a running race! There are no aid stations. You bring your own crew, or you rely on the community... The course map is available only a couple days before the race, and to prove you ran all 100 miles, you need to collect 'tokens' from plastic pumpkin buckets along the course. The tokens could be 'Dum Dum' suckers, random objects, or wooden tokens. Trust me, if something is in a bucket, you need to bring it to the finish line. This year, I collected 2 suckers and 3 wooden tokens. Oh, and just for fun, there are even more 'fake' buckets that are completely empty!" (https://teamrunrun.com/marji-gesick-100/)

**Carl Jarema [ELITE]:** "The after party is work sticking around for, cheering on the other race distances between the runners and bikers." (https://teamrunrun.com/marji-gesick-100/)

**Andrea Larson [COMPETITIVE]:** "Since 2019, I've pushed to expand my limits, largely due to the event I have done for the past three years on the same day as Marji, the Baby Barkley, aka the Barkley Fall Classic. Both Laz and Todd have a desire to push the edge of human potential." (https://www.ironbull.org/blog/marji-2024a)

**Heath Paukette [ELITE]:** "The dark woods are so mesmerizing. You can see lights all over the trails, some above you, some below you, and you're not sure which direction you came from or where you're going." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/heaths-story-marji-gesick)

**Heath Paukette [ELITE] on trail angels:** "As I mentioned, it's self supported, but the community comes out and makes sure riders have water throughout the day. It's crazy to come across a guy in a duck suit in the middle of the woods at 12:30 a.m. offering water, snacks, etc, or another spot where they are offering cokes, rice krispy treats, gin and tonics, beer, and other stuff." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/heaths-story-marji-gesick)

**906AT Official description [UNKNOWN]:** "Support Crews. I am going to go so far as to say, the best part of Marji is all of the people who spend their day (and night) helping you get to da finish. It has been incredible to witness. I hope all of you appreciate how special this is. An event of this magnitude requires a lot of sacrifice by you and the folks who are out there to help… many of them are complete strangers. Do me a favor, and thank all of the volunteers and support crews." (https://906adventureteam.com/marji-gesick-blog/)

**906AT Official description [UNKNOWN]:** "Neutral support, if offered to one person, must be offered to all. It's really that simple. It's y'all against us. So be good to each other, and help every one ya can." (https://906adventureteam.com/marji-gesick-blog/)

**Jill Martindale [COMPETITIVE]:** "Staying hyped about the Marji helped to keep me motivated for training and I'm thankful I was able to spend time talking about the race and training with many of my favorite riding partners... When things weren't going my way in other races or rides, shouting, 'MARJI TRAINING!' with friends kept things fun. Screaming, 'MARJI!' when you're slogging through wind and rain on a commute or holding a group ride back because you've had a mechanical turns the situation comical and keeps it entertaining." (https://www.salsacycles.com/blogs/articles/8-tips-for-thriving-not-just-surviving-at-marji-gesick)

**c0nsumer [UNKNOWN]:** "My girlfriend helped a TON, meeting me at the aid stations with mixed bottles and a surprise whitefish burrito. This helped a bunch." (https://www.reddit.com/r/MTB/comments/9i8d7o/marji_gesick_100_howd_your_race_go/)
