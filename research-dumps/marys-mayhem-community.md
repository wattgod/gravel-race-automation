# MARYS MAYHEM — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Nicole Oh [ELITE]:** "There's no doubt that the popularity of gravel riding is increasing, with more and more events appearing on the calendar. Mary's Mayhem, held on the roads around Mudgee, was Graveleur's second event of the year. Unlike Thunderbolts held earlier in May, the courses for Mary's were far less difficult and much more conducive to fun times and good vibes!" (https://thebodymechanic.com.au/marys-mayhem-gravel-ride-australia/)

**Nicole Oh [ELITE]:** "Now, it was the understanding of all that this event was NOT a race. The timing chips were (apparently) a trial for future events. But a timing chip and prize for the first female across the line sounds like a race to me." (https://thebodymechanic.com.au/marys-mayhem-gravel-ride-australia/)

**Nicole Oh [ELITE]:** "The boys we were riding with seemed full of enthusiasm and it was a pretty solid pace from the outset. This was perhaps aided by fresh legs, champagne gravel and the fact the first part of the course was net downhill! By the time we got to the feed stop in Gulgong at 60km (in under 2 hours), some of these boys looked a bit cooked!" (https://thebodymechanic.com.au/marys-mayhem-gravel-ride-australia/)

**Nicole Oh [ELITE]:** "My racing instincts then took over, as I found myself putting in a dig over the top of the last hill to get a gap (whilst the guy in front of me popped a wheelie! See photo), and a little sprint to the finish to ensure I was 2nd female over the line (and as I found out later, 15th overall). The faster than expected ride meant we were all done by 12.30pm." (https://thebodymechanic.com.au/marys-mayhem-gravel-ride-australia/)

**Nicole Oh [ELITE]:** "The route today seemed a lot more scenic, although perhaps that was due to the fact we rode much less hard, and therefore had plenty more time to look around! It started and ended with tarmac, but with a whole load of champagne gravel in between with just a few corrugations." (https://thebodymechanic.com.au/marys-mayhem-gravel-ride-australia/)

**Mike Israel (Event Founder) [UNKNOWN]:** "I started Graveleur back in 2017 with a few mates looking for dirt roads to ride. It grew into something much bigger - a national community of over 6,500 riders who love getting off the beaten path and supporting the regional towns they pass through." (https://www.midwesternliving.com.au/blog/marys-mayhem-gravel-grit-and-a-whole-lot-of-heart)

**Mike Israel [UNKNOWN]:** "Mudgee was a natural choice. It's got amazing dirt roads, scenic country, a cracking food scene and great places to stay. Plus, the local cycling club and community have been incredibly supportive." (https://www.midwesternliving.com.au/blog/marys-mayhem-gravel-grit-and-a-whole-lot-of-heart)

**Mike Israel [UNKNOWN]:** "Graveleur is for everyone. Whether you're twelve or seventy, on a carbon race bike or a hand-me-down hybrid, there's a route for you." (https://www.midwesternliving.com.au/blog/marys-mayhem-gravel-grit-and-a-whole-lot-of-heart)

**Mike Israel [UNKNOWN]:** "We felt so welcomed. It was magic" (referring to the community market in Rylstone where "practically every resident from Rylstone came out"). (https://www.midwesternliving.com.au/blog/marys-mayhem-gravel-grit-and-a-whole-lot-of-heart)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Course Profile - Saturday (Long Course) [from ELITE rider report]:** 97km with 1000m of climbing. First part of the course is net downhill, making for fast early pacing. Feed stop at Gulgong at 60km mark. Hills concentrated in the second half of the course. (https://thebodymechanic.com.au/marys-mayhem-gravel-ride-australia/)

**Course Profile - Sunday (Long Course) [from ELITE rider report]:** Same distance as Saturday (97km) but with slightly more climbing at 1200m. Started and ended in Rylstone. Route featured tarmac at start/finish with "a whole load of champagne gravel in between with just a few corrugations." Nice gentle downhill roll home on tarmac with tailwind. (https://thebodymechanic.com.au/marys-mayhem-gravel-ride-australia/)

**Surface Conditions [from ELITE rider]:** Described repeatedly as "champagne gravel" - smooth, fast gravel roads. "Just a few corrugations" noted on Sunday's course. (https://thebodymechanic.com.au/marys-mayhem-gravel-ride-australia/)

**Terrain Character [from event description]:** "The area is relatively flat being over the great dividing range so the distances will not be as taxing as some of our other event locations." Three course options: Short (~30km/day), Medium (~60km/day), Long (~100km/day). (https://graveleur.cc/marys-mayhem-event-page)

**Mudgee region described as:** "Did you know Mudgee is a relatively flat region? There is virtually no climbing on the courses. Just rolling hills." (https://graveleur.cc/marys-mayhem-event-page)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Fast Group Pacing [ELITE rider experience]:** Group reached the 60km feed stop in under 2 hours (30+ km/h average), which was described as cooking some riders. Elite rider noted: "a ride tends to be dictated by how you start it" - suggesting early pace sets the tone for the day. (https://thebodymechanic.com.au/marys-mayhem-gravel-ride-australia/)

**"Party Pace" Strategy [ELITE rider attempting social ride]:** Started at the back of the field to eliminate temptation to go fast. Day 2 included "a good 45min of stopping for photos, food, regrouping, and even just sitting in the sun." This approach allowed much more scenery appreciation. (https://thebodymechanic.com.au/marys-mayhem-gravel-ride-australia/)

**Course Timing [ELITE rider finishing times]:** Fast-paced long course finished by 12:30pm (9am start), leaving afternoon free for post-ride activities. (https://thebodymechanic.com.au/marys-mayhem-gravel-ride-australia/)

**Net Downhill Start:** First section being net downhill with fresh legs contributed to fast early pacing - riders should be aware this can lead to overcooking early efforts. (https://thebodymechanic.com.au/marys-mayhem-gravel-ride-australia/)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Event Vibe [ELITE rider]:** "Much more conducive to fun times and good vibes" compared to other gravel events. The dual nature of timed/untimed racing created some confusion but allowed for multiple riding styles. (https://thebodymechanic.com.au/marys-mayhem-gravel-ride-australia/)

**Post-Ride Activities [ELITE rider]:** "Plenty of time to soak up the sun and enjoy the fine choice of food and refreshments on offer" at Small Batch Brewery. Options included visiting gin distillery or winery on bikes, though rider chose hotel relaxation, donuts, Negroni, and pub dinner. (https://thebodymechanic.com.au/marys-mayhem-gravel-ride-australia/)

**Local Community Involvement:** Event supported by Rotary Clubs of Rylstone and Mudgee, CWA branches in Gulgong and Rylstone staffing checkpoints, baking cakes, and offering first aid.

**Event Philosophy:** Named after Mary Ann Bugg, "a proud Worimi woman and arguably Australia's first female bushranger in the 1800s" who allegedly busted Captain Thunderbolt out of Cockatoo Island prison by swimming shark-infested Sydney Harbour waters with a file in her teeth. Legacy described as "defiant, resourceful, and strong." (https://www.midwesternliving.com.au/blog/marys-mayhem-gravel-grit-and-a-whole-lot-of-heart and https://graveleur.cc/marys-mayhem-event-page)

**Video Recap Description:** "Two days of epic riding, endless champagne gravel, cold beers, and live music at the finish—what more could you ask for? The vibes were high and we had an absolute blast." (https://graveleur.cc/features/marys-mayhem-video-recap)

## Weather Experienced

**2024 Event Weather [from ELITE rider report]:** "Saturday started a little on the chilly side, but once the sun had burnt through the morning fog, it was a beautiful day to ride a bike." Sunday weather described as "almost a carbon copy of day 1 - a little fog and chill, but then glorious sunshine for the rest of the day." (https://thebodymechanic.com.au/marys-mayhem-gravel-ride-australia/)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Wildlife Hazard [ELITE rider observation]:** "The only downside of the day was the numerous 'sleeping' wombats by the side of the road" - suggesting road kill present, potential collision risk for riders not paying attention. (https://thebodymechanic.com.au/marys-mayhem-gravel-ride-australia/)

**Early Pace Overcooking:** Elite rider observed that riders starting fast on the net-downhill first section "looked a bit cooked" by the 60km feed stop after maintaining sub-2-hour pace. Suggests pacing discipline needed despite fast early terrain. (https://thebodymechanic.com.au/marys-mayhem-gravel-ride-australia/)
