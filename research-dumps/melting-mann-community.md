## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Mann Road:** The signature feature of the course, described as a "seasonal road" that creates significant challenges. The race explicitly warns riders to "bike it, NOT hike it" on Mann Road. One source notes "where many swap pedals for boots." Video evidence from 2023 shows "decent amount of the carnage on Mann road at the start."

**Course character:** Routes wind through "woods, around lakes, past farms, and across open fields" with "rolling hills" and "scenic backroads." Described as having a "roller coaster" quality on the 39-mile course.

**Surface conditions:** "Dirt, gravel, and mud" with "bumps and potholes that come with off-road riding." Early spring timing means conditions can include frozen ground, mud, or winter remnants.
