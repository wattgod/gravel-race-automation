# MID SOUTH — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Nic Morales [COMPETITIVE]:** "There was no worse place to talk to Bobby Wintle. Sitting in the middle of Stonecloud Brewery... He knew everyone. Everyone had something to say, and he had an impossibly equal, in-depth response to anyone who approached." (https://bikepacking.com/plog/mega-mid-south-2024/)

**Nic Morales [COMPETITIVE]:** "Mega Mid South is an grueling, unsupported race around the perimeter of previous Mid South routes in Oklahoma. It's 300 miles of B-roads and almost 17,000 feet of climbing. Needless to say, not only is it a test of one's bike, it is also a test of one's mettle." (https://velo-orange.com/blogs/theveloorangeblog/nics-mega-mid-south-report-and-upcoming-events)

**Nic Morales [COMPETITIVE]:** "Why would I pay anyone to tell me where to ride? I like looking at Google Maps for hours on end and figuring it out. I didn't see the need for an aid station or any sort of expectation thrust upon me. I just like riding my bike! Why did it ever need to be anything more than that?" (https://bikepacking.com/plog/mega-mid-south-2024/)

**Chris Mehlman [ELITE]:** "I was more nervous than I am for most races. Perhaps, it was because it was the first race of the season. More likely, however, was a combination of this and the uncertainty of coming off a concussion." (https://chrismehlman.substack.com/p/race-report-mid-south-gravel-2024)

**Chris Mehlman [ELITE]:** "The accelerations pushed me to my limit not in terms of lungs, but in terms of legs. I could ride a good hard pace, but not go with the surges that characterize this course of never-ending short, rolling hills." (https://chrismehlman.substack.com/p/race-report-mid-south-gravel-2024)

**Chris Mehlman [ELITE]:** "After a few hot days previously, I was thankful for this. During the middle section, the accelerations on climbs left me dangling often, but I was able to get back each time with a steady pace. Undoubtedly, this cost my legs, but it was all I could do on the day with so little explosiveness in me." (https://chrismehlman.substack.com/p/race-report-mid-south-gravel-2024)

**Richard Poole/Bicycle Crumbs [ELITE]:** "The first 50 miles: 'that was the hardest 50 miles I've ever done.' I could have stopped riding right then and known it was a big day. It would be the stoppage of the rain that made things more difficult as the wet clay began to dry out." (https://www.mettlecycling.com/post/the-mid-south-mettle-race-report)

**Richard Poole [ELITE]:** "Nothing could have prepared me for these conditions except maybe having done this race 2 years prior when the same thing happened. Even growing up in Oklahoma, I was aware of how sticky the clay can be but riding through it on a bike without proper clearance was something else entirely." (https://www.mettlecycling.com/post/the-mid-south-mettle-race-report)

**Richard Poole [ELITE]:** "It only took 2 revolutions of your wheels to build up enough clay to stop you dead in your tracks. Paint stirrers handed out at the start were helpful in clearing mud (and clear coat) from the frame but ultimately, the few riders that brought CX sized tires were the true winners. My total stoppage time for clearing the bike was close to 20 minutes." (https://www.mettlecycling.com/post/the-mid-south-mettle-race-report)

**Richard Poole [ELITE]:** "Except for the first 90 minutes, The Mid South was the loneliest day on the bike I've ever had. Not in the sad, 'I'm single' sense but in the most literal. My strategy was 'Hang on to the lead group as long as possible and then settle in for the long-haul.'" (https://www.mettlecycling.com/post/the-mid-south-mettle-race-report)

**Bobby Wintle (Race Director) [UNKNOWN]:** "People just kept asking me. You have to do an ultra. We want it. We need it... I didn't want to take away from the festival that is The Mid South weekend in the spring... I've never hosted an ultra race. I didn't know what it needed, and I wanted to do it right." Asked if he was nervous: "Fuck yeah!" (https://bikepacking.com/plog/mega-mid-south-2024/)

**Trix8806 [COMPETITIVE]:** "This weekend has turned into a pretty big disaster. When we got to the expo at 3, it was just shutting down due to the 40 mph sustained winds and 60 mph gusts. Portapotty's were tipped over, tents flying, etc. very unsafe. Went back to our campground at Lake Carl Blackwell. Around 4 pm police knock on our camper door. Wild fires in the park, immediate evacuation." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/mid-south-gravel-2025-thread/96156)

**Trix8806 [COMPETITIVE]:** "After about an hour, we were able to follow emergency vehicles out. Campers were already burnt to the ground and fire on both sides of the road... The spot we were parked initially was all burnt up. Hooked up the trailer quick and made it out. Camping in a church parking lot tonight. Completely worn." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/mid-south-gravel-2025-thread/96156)

**Seth (friend of race reporter) [RECREATIONAL]:** "So, if Bobby created a religion I would join... Bobby was an inspiration in how to treat people and that his positive energy seemed to rub off on the thousands of people in town over the race weekend." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/hugs-matter-4-takeaways-from-the-mid-south-gravel-race)

**Sarah Sturm [ELITE]:** "The racing is such a small part of what makes this event special." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/hugs-matter-4-takeaways-from-the-mid-south-gravel-race)

**Brennan Wertz (gravel pro) [ELITE]:** "I'm not necessarily here for the music, but seeing Bobby live moved me. I think it's cool this event encompasses so much more than just a bike race." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/hugs-matter-4-takeaways-from-the-mid-south-gravel-race)

**B3BH1T [RECREATIONAL]:** "First time at Mid South and also my first gravel century. Came in at under 8 hours. Can't wait to be back next year. Glad I helped some folks on the rolling hills with my speaker playing metal music." (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/1bhprki/mid_south_fun/)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Tire Clearance [ELITE perspective]:** Richard Poole rode a 2019 Specialized Crux (CX specific bike) with Maxxis Rambler 40c TLR tires. He noted: "My biggest problem was the slack, no-snap feel of the diverge when accelerating. A bit of snap and confidence from a CX bike was largely a mental need... Had it stayed dry, I would have likely kept the road pedals on but packed the CX shoes and pedals knowing there would be no way I'd set a foot down and ever clip back with road pedals once things got even a little moist." However, he also stated: "the few riders that brought CX sized tires were the true winners" in muddy conditions, suggesting his 40c tires weren't enough. (https://www.mettlecycling.com/post/the-mid-south-mettle-race-report)

**Bike Setup [COMPETITIVE perspective]:** Nic Morales finished 25th out of 150 at Mega Mid South (300 miles) on a Velo Orange Chessie aluminum alloy bike. (https://velo-orange.com/blogs/theveloorangeblog/nics-mega-mid-south-report-and-upcoming-events)

**Bike Setup [ELITE perspective]:** Chris Mehlman rode a Pivot Vault with Easton EC90sl Crankset w/ Cinch Power, 44t chainring, 11-36 cassette, Enve SES AR 4.5 wheels laced to Chris King R45 hubs, and Force CX1 groupset for the 100-mile race. (https://chrismehlman.substack.com/p/race-report-mid-south-gravel-2024)

**Mud Clearing Tools [ELITE perspective]:** "Paint stirrers handed out at the start were helpful in clearing mud (and clear coat) from the frame." Total stoppage time for clearing mud: close to 20 minutes for Richard Poole. (https://www.mettlecycling.com/post/the-mid-south-mettle-race-report)

**Weather Gear [ELITE perspective]:** Richard Poole used the Rapha Explore Hooded Gore-Tex Pullover: "For both on and off the bike, meets all the requirements for bad-weather riding or spectating and allowed me to bring only one jacket for the trip instead of multiple specialized garments." His foot warming hack: "cling-wrap and aluminum foil on my feet (inside my shoes). Shoe covers were not going to fare well on the day so keeping my feet warm and relatively comfortable was going to keep the long day at least somewhat doable. It 100% worked." Also used "A cut up T-shirt I stuffed into my cap to keep my ears from freezing." (https://www.mettlecycling.com/post/the-mid-south-mettle-race-report)

**Bags and Storage [ELITE perspective]:** Richard Poole chose not to use bar bags or hydration packs: "I don't typically race with bar bags or hydration packs, although I had contemplated taking a frame bag. Looking back, that would have caused a ton of additional problems from blocking access to bottles (or preventing a larger 28oz bottle from fitting) to interfering with shouldering the bike later in the race." (https://www.mettlecycling.com/post/the-mid-south-mettle-race-report)

**Number Plate Solution [ELITE perspective]:** Chris Mehlman used a number plate solution from So Pro Cycling that "keeps it aero when needed and vertical crossing timing mats." (https://chrismehlman.substack.com/p/race-report-mid-south-gravel-2024)

## Weather Experienced

**2024 Race (100-mile):** Chris Mehlman reported "perfect" temperatures: "I felt cool the entire time, but never cold. After a few hot days previously, I was thankful for this." (https://chrismehlman.substack.com/p/race-report-mid-south-gravel-2024)

**2024 Race (100-mile, Elite perspective):** Richard Poole described the first half as "soaking wet" with "torrential rain, high speeds, and anything but stable surface conditions." Rain stopped around 11am. "It would be the stoppage of the rain that made things more difficult as the wet clay began to dry out... the roads began to dry into a perfect storm of progress stopping muck." (https://www.mettlecycling.com/post/the-mid-south-mettle-race-report)

**2024 Mega Mid South (300-mile):** Nic Morales noted: "temperatures were set to near 20 degrees above normal for that time of year. Instead of a balmy 75-85°F, temperatures for nearly all of its intended run time soared into the high 90s and even past 100." (https://bikepacking.com/plog/mega-mid-south-2024/)

**2025 Race (canceled due to wildfires):** Trix8806 reported: "Looking to be a pretty perfect race day. No rain for over a week and reasonable temps... Wind tomorrow is going to be wild, steady 20's-30's with gusts in the 50's." However, the race was canceled due to wildfires exacerbated by extreme winds. "When we got to the expo at 3, it was just shutting down due to the 40 mph sustained winds and 60 mph gusts." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/mid-south-gravel-2025-thread/96156)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Course Character:** "This course of never-ending short, rolling hills" with "deep sandy sections scattered throughout the course." (https://chrismehlman.substack.com/p/race-report-mid-south-gravel-2024)

**Key Sections (100-mile course):** Chris Mehlman noted the water crossing at 12 miles in, and "1.5 miles of twisty singletrack with 10 miles left in the race." He described the singletrack: "It was fun ripping through the twisty trails on my Pivot Vault." (https://chrismehlman.substack.com/p/race-report-mid-south-gravel-2024)

**Neutral Rollout:** Chris Mehlman described it as "a mix of elbows, curbs, potholes, a roundabout, and sharp corners." (https://chrismehlman.substack.com/p/race-report-mid-south-gravel-2024)

**Gnarnia Section:** Richard Poole mentioned "the Gnarnia doubletrack section" where he "decided to avoid waiting in line and go through the hole. It was deeper than anticipated. This is where the group splintered… again." (https://www.mettlecycling.com/post/the-mid-south-mettle-race-report)

**Red Clay Surface:** "Unlike the hard bedrock of the flint hills and similar gravel roads that pattern the Midwest, The Mid South (or 'Mud South') hosted in Stillwater, Oklahoma is characterized by its rich red clay." (https://theradavist.com/tag/mid-south)

**Trench Crossing:** Richard Poole noted photo taken "before the trench crossing at mile 60." (https://www.mettlecycling.com/post/the-mid-south-mettle-race-report)

**Mega Mid South Route (300-mile):** "Starting and ending at the shop in Stillwater, Oklahoma, the 300-mile loop is comprised of the outer perimeter of every MID-SOUTH course over the past 13 years. The route traverses the tribal land of the Quapaw, Kiowa, Osage, Kickapoo, Pawnee, Iowa and Wichita Nations." (https://theradavist.com/tag/mid-south)

**Downtown Finish:** Chris Mehlman noted: "Previously, this race has struggled with sending the whole field (1200 100-milers and 800 50-milers) through open road intersections and stoplights in downtown Stillwater within the last 3 miles of the course. This year, they shut these down with full police details. I felt much safer." (https://chrismehlman.substack.com/p/race-report-mid-south-gravel-2024)

**2025 Course Update:** "New course this year - 106 miles and 800'+ of climbing" (noted for 2025 before cancellation). (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/mid-south-gravel-2025-thread/96156)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**[ELITE] Chris Mehlman's Pacing:** Finished in 4:38:12 for 100 miles, 30th place. "My power was almost identical [to the previous year], but I finished 16 spots lower in 30th place." He noted: "I immediately felt where I was lacking: punch. The accelerations pushed me to my limit not in terms of lungs, but in terms of legs. I could ride a good hard pace, but not go with the surges." His strategy: "I spent the rest of the race in an ever-dwindling group... I managed to get onto the trail in 2nd wheel... By this point, the rest of my group had been dulled. With fewer surges, I was feeling great, and honestly wishing we had more left." (https://chrismehlman.substack.com/p/race-report-mid-south-gravel-2024)

**[COMPETITIVE] Trix8806's Goal:** "I don't know that I really have a goal time. Too many unknowns for me. I'm thinking around 6-6.5 hrs would be great. More than anything I just want a steady race without bonking - finishing strong. I'll need to keep my head screwed on right for the first 30-40 miles." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/mid-south-gravel-2025-thread/96156)

**[RECREATIONAL] 8-Hour Finish:** B3BH1T reported finishing under 8 hours for first gravel century. (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/1bhprki/mid_south_fun/)

**[ELITE] Richard Poole's Strategy:** "My strategy was 'Hang on to the lead group as long as possible and then settle in for the long-haul.' If I could carefully ride the wave of bleeding eyeballs and get as much ground covered while the gettin' was good, I'd be fine with losing contact on the first few steep pitches." His finish time was approximately 7.5 hours. (https://www.mettlecycling.com/post/the-mid-south-mettle-race-report)

**[COMPETITIVE] Mega Mid South Completion:** Nic Morales finished 25th out of 150 on the 300-mile course. Bobby Wintle finished in 47 hours 30 minutes on a single speed. Only 34 people finished the inaugural Mega Mid South route out of 150 starters. (https://bikepacking.com/plog/mega-mid-south-2024/ and https://theradavist.com/tag/mid-south)

**Race Speed Trends [ELITE perspective]:** "In 2019, Ted King, Payson McElveen, and Drew Dillman basically crossed the finish line of the Mid South holding hands... those guys finishing times would have put them in 87th place at the race this weekend. The winners in 2019 would have been 87th this year. Toby Røed won the men's race in 4:26:54 and Lauren De Crescenzo the women's in 4:47:42, both setting records on the 100-mile course used this year." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/hugs-matter-4-takeaways-from-the-mid-south-gravel-race)

## Race Strategy & Pacing: Nutrition

**[ELITE] Richard Poole's Nutrition (7.5 hour finish):** 

First 50 miles:
- 8 "cubes" of Heavenly Hunks - unwrapped (960 cal)
- 2 RX Bars (410 cal)
- 2 MySpring Oatmeal Fruit Energy packs (600 cal)
- 2 MySpring Long Haul packs (220 Cal)
- 2 Bottles of Nuun

Half-way point in Perkins:
- Espresso prepared by Rapha's Tim Coughlin
- 12oz Coca-Cola (140cal 39g of sugar)
- Snickers (250 Cal)

Second 50 miles including stop at Mile 80:
- Snickers (250 Cal)
- 1 MySpring Oatmeal Fruit Energy pack (300 cal)
- 2 RX Bars (410 Cal)
- 2 Bottles of Nuun
- 1 Banana
- 1 Mini Waffle
- 6 Oreos (318 Cal)
- 1 Bottle Skratch
- 1 package Skratch Gummies (160 Cal)

"Approximately 4000* calories consumed and 7355kcal burned."

He noted challenges: "One of my biggest worries was eating on the bike during the first 2 hours of the race. While the pros made it as difficult as possible, I was hoping to stay in the lead group. Dark skies, torrential rain, high speeds, and anything but stable surface conditions meant reaching back for whatever my fat gloved fingers could pull out of my stuffed pockets would have to wait for a lull in the pace - which never happened." (https://www.mettlecycling.com/post/the-mid-south-mettle-race-report)

**[ELITE] Chris Mehlman's Pre-Race Meal:** "The usual pre-race breakfast of cold microwaved Kodiak Cakes pancakes I made the night before (before you judge, they kit all the macro targets, are low in fiber, taste identical to normal pancakes, and can be cooked in a place with no stove and with just 5 minutes of prep)." (https://chrismehlman.substack.com/p/race-report-mid-south-gravel-2024)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Mechanical Failures from Mud [ELITE perspective]:** "It only took 2 revolutions of your wheels to build up enough clay to stop you dead in your tracks... My total stoppage time for clearing the bike was close to 20 minutes." (https://www.mettlecycling.com/post/the-mid-south-mettle-race-report)

**Mega Mid South Attrition [COMPETITIVE/UNKNOWN mix]:** Only 34 people finished the inaugural 300-mile Mega Mid South route out of 150 starters (77% DNF rate). Weather was a major factor with temperatures "soaring into the high 90s and even past 100." (https://bikepacking.com/plog/mega-mid-south-2024/ and https://theradavist.com/tag/mid-south)

**Positioning Issues in Fast Start [ELITE perspective]:** Chris Mehlman: "My positioning was not great, but the start ended up being slightly less explosive than last year. Despite this, I immediately felt where I was lacking: punch... Inevitably, this meant I moved up during the lulls in pace, but then lost those spots in surges. After missing a split due to these positioning struggles, I was in a group that chased back on, only to catch up to the leaders right in a mud pit, which shattered the group again." (https://chrismehlman.substack.com/p/race-report-mid-south-gravel-2024)

**Course Hazards [ELITE perspective]:** Chris Mehlman noted "more than a few crashes happened just ahead of me" in double-track sections with deep ruts. He "just missed out on sending my front wheel into a 2-foot deep and 3-foot wide hole. My body and my brand new ARX front wheel and probably my frame are thanking me for taking quick action. That would have been race over, a few broken bones, and maybe, a bike eaten alive by the hole." (https://chrismehlman.substack.com/p/race-report-mid-south-gravel-2024)

**Natural Disasters:** 2025 race was completely canceled due to wildfires. Trix8806's campground at Lake Carl Blackwell was evacuated: "Campers were already burnt to the ground and fire on both sides of the road." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/mid-south-gravel-2025-thread/96156)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Bobby Wintle's Signature:** "The charismatic Kansan hugs every. single. finisher. as they run or ride across the finish line. It's not an exaggeration. The man makes you feel loved." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/hugs-matter-4-takeaways-from-the-mid-south-gravel-race)

**Inclusive Culture:** "The Mid South has also become known in the gravel world as one of the most welcoming events on the calendar. Its nonbinary category grew by 60 percent this year. Dozens of juniors competed. The body size-inclusive All Bodies on Bikes hosted the DFL party after its founder, Marley Blonskey took those honors last year." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/hugs-matter-4-takeaways-from-the-mid-south-gravel-race)

**DFL (Dead Effing Last) Celebration:** "Perhaps the biggest draw of the weekend happens long after most riders should be fast asleep on Saturday night — a huge street party that happens under disco balls and twinkly lights while awaiting the last person on course. This year, the honors went to the duo of Beth McBride-Haydock and Alma Rivero. Somehow, Bobby had enough energy to hug them as tightly as the thousands that finished before." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/hugs-matter-4-takeaways-from-the-mid-south-gravel-race)

**Music Festival Component:** Bobby Wintle: "I always wanted to throw a music festival. With a little bike race as part of it." Brennan Wertz noted: "I'm not necessarily here for the music, but seeing Bobby live moved me." There's also "A+ vibes" with "a legit music festival going on during the weekend." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/hugs-matter-4-takeaways-from-the-mid-south-gravel-race and https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/mid-south-gravel-2025-thread/96156)

**Pre-Race Activities:** "In addition to shakeout rides and the music fest, there are also myriad other meetups at the Mid South, including a very fun beer can release party on Thursday at the local brewery to a Sunday yoga sesh." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/hugs-matter-4-takeaways-from-the-mid-south-gravel-race)

**Community Support at Start:** "A ragtag brass band called 'King Cabbage Brass' serenaded us" at the start line. (https://chrismehlman.substack.com/p/race-report-mid-south-gravel-2024)

**Local Community Support:** Nic Morales observed Bobby Wintle at Stonecloud Brewery: "He knew everyone. Everyone had something to say, and he had an impossibly equal, in-depth response to anyone who approached. 'Oh yeah? How's the cousin? He's playing today, right?' 'Yes, dude! This is RaShaun, he makes the best ice cream in town.' 'Heck yeah, man. Glad you finished.' It went on like this for an hour." (https://bikepacking.com/plog/mega-mid-south-2024/)

**Mid-Race Support:** Richard Poole's mother provided pit support at mile 60 in Perkins (the halfway point), helping with bike washing and providing a Snickers bar. Rapha's Tim Coughlin was also at the halfway point preparing espresso for racers. SRAM neutral support was available on course. (https://www.mettlecycling.com/post/the-mid-south-mettle-race-report)

**District Bicycles Support:** "The crew at District was hard at work ensuring everyone had what they needed in order to start. From brake bleeds to basic chain checks, they were set on getting anyone brave enough to line up to start the race." (https://bikepacking.com/plog/mega-mid-south-2024/)

**Family Friendly:** "Also, very family friendly, whether they ride or not. Theres a kids gymnastics gym that does a class on Saturday mornings. Lot of things to do and watch at the expo, plus A+ vibes." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/mid-south-gravel-2025-thread/96156)

**Stillwater as Host Town:** "it used to be strange to imagine wishing you were in Stillwater, Oklahoma in mid-March... Now, if you're not at the Mid South, you wish you were because that's where everyone else is the second weekend in March." The event has become "the best party-disguised-as-a-gravel-race." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/hugs-matter-4-takeaways-from-the-mid-south-gravel-race)

**Season Opener Status:** "Mid South Gravel is the traditional kickoff to the gravel cycling season and a weekend full of excitement, endless miles of red dirt, and some of the best parties you've experienced. For these few days, the Stillwater community is filled with cyclists from all over the world, industry professionals, and advocacy groups." (https://www.allbodiesonbikes.com/about-the-program-midsouth)

**No Prize Money, Pros Still Attend:** "There is no prize money at the Mid South, and the standalone event isn't a part of any series. That said, many pros have made it a priority to attend every year. It's a good, straightforward early-season 100-mile race, good for testing the legs." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/hugs-matter-4-takeaways-from-the-mid-south-gravel-race)

**2026 Format Change:** Starting in 2026, the race will split pro and amateur days for safety reasons. "A new pro-only 100-mile race will be held on Friday afternoon, March 13, followed by the traditional mass-start amateur race on Saturday morning... Wintle personally embraces every finisher" and separating finish chutes wasn't acceptable to maintain the event's inclusive ethos. The Friday pro finish is "slated for 5:15 p.m. in downtown Stillwater."
