## COMMUNITY & REPUTATION

**Race History**

The event was **originally called the Land Run 100**. "The first Land Run 100, now known as The Mid South linked 107 miles of red, rutted roads and featured more than 6,000 feet of climbing with Carney, Oklahoma as its halfway point. 121 riders braved the course that first year"[5]. The **Mega Mid South is the result of over 10 years of planning and route building** for The Mid South, with the inaugural grand depart event recently held[3].

**Founder/Promoter**

The race is based at **District Bicycles in Stillwater, Oklahoma**, which appears to be the primary organizer[3].

- **Jill Martindale**: Holds the Mega Mid South fastest known time (FKT) of **25 hours 12 minutes**[3].

## RACE REPORTS & RIDER EXPERIENCE

**Specific Rider Experiences & Quotes**

From Nordic Trailblazer race report:

"The chase is on again, but my chasing group is splitting up. This is because so many are about to feel the hard start and must slow down. Soon, I find myself with a heck of a strong rider, Luke Hall"[5].

The reporter noted excitement seeing other riders: "**– Look there!** I scream with enthusiasm. We see a group of riders up front"[5].

The reporter also noted the tactical element of the race: "The surface is now for a change on the tarmac. 91% of the route is off-road, so it's a perfect relief from all the bumpy and loose gravel roads. The section also helps us speed us, and soon we are gathering with a group of 6, making us a 9-men group"[5].

**River Crossing Challenges**

Riders reported crossing the river: "The best way seemed to go on the left side and cross just a tiny section of the rider. A few riders try to ride across the deeper point. They just make it!"[5]. The promoter had apparently warned about this: "The promoter has been talking about this river from the start. People have been publishing stories on Instagram about riding across the river in the last few days"[5].

**Equipment Recommendations**

"We recommend a tire of at least 38mm setup tubeless"[3]. The rationale: "As with any Mid South route, these roads are ever changing. The route is 99.9% unpaved and the dirt will change with the weather conditions"[3].

**Water/Hydration Emphasis**

"Don't underestimate your need for water. It's been a hot, hot summer here in OK and these roads will dry you out!"[3].

**DNF Rates**

Not specified in available search results, though historical mud conditions have caused riders to abandon: "many riders had to abandon the race as they couldn't get their wheels to spin due to mud!"[5].

**Difficulty Insights**

Course difficulty is heavily dependent on pace and weather: "Weather and road conditions will drastically affect the physical difficulty. If there is any sustained rainfall, much of the western side of the route could be impassable mud. Pace will also greatly affect the difficulty. Doing this route in three days will be far more challenging than breaking it into five days, even for a fit rider"[2].
