# MID-STATE GRAVEL GRINDER — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Lynn Botelho [ELITE]:** "After another hard battle with Beth Williams (a great competitor), I managed the age group win and with it the Trans-Sylvania Gravel Series Title... This was a relatively flat course for us in PA: 48 miles with only 3,458 feet of gain. That said, we still had plenty of challenges. There was about 1 - 1.5 mile of baby head gravel on a descent. I knew I couldn't win the race here, but I could lose it. So my mantra was 'Stay Upright.' I do not know or care who heard me as I repeated it, out loud, the entire way. I am happy to report that I 'Stay(ed) Upright.' There were also several gates to wiggle through, almost U-turns, and a very bumpy air field for the finish."

**Evan McGregor [ELITE]:** "I took the lead on Tram into its climb and from there I pushed a high pace to discourage any attacking, but without going over the line. On the descents and corners, I went hard to keep a lead spot... The last bit of Tram has a really rough section of embedded rock. I've done races here before, and my first memory was of Tim Cusick dropping me on the chunkiest part of the descent as I got nervous and uncertain. Today, I opened up on the roughest part. I saw the lines to take, where I could pedal through, and I took almost 3 minutes off of my descent time from that first visit... I attacked over the top and down a descent to get the gap. I wasn't the strongest, but I was the fastest to the bottom, and held onto my 30+second gap to the finish." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/evans-story-mid-state-gravel-grinder)

**HoboStephen [UNKNOWN]:** "Rode in my first bike race yesterday! The Mid-state gravel grinder was perfect and I couldn't be happier with the progress I've made since I started four months ago. To anyone new with apprehension for doing an event: just sign up for one that's reasonable to achieve and push yourself!"

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Baby head gravel descent:** Lynn Botelho [ELITE] described "about 1 - 1.5 mile of baby head gravel on a descent" where maintaining control was critical. (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/lynns-story-mid-state-gravel-grinder)

**Tram Road section:** Evan McGregor [ELITE] identified Tram Road as a key tactical section with a climb followed by "a really rough section of embedded rock" on the descent. He noted this is where he made his race-winning move, taking "almost 3 minutes off of my descent time" compared to previous years by staying aggressive through the chunkiest sections.

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Evan McGregor's winning strategy [ELITE]:** "My pre-race plan took hold. Stick in, help keep the pace relatively high, and when we get to Tram Road, go for it. I took the lead on Tram into its climb and from there I pushed a high pace to discourage any attacking, but without going over the line. On the descents and corners, I went hard to keep a lead spot... When I got to the base today and looked over my shoulder (arm locked, chin to shoulder) to see if I got any gap, I didn't see any of my trio. I drove on, and with ten miles to go, committed to going full to the line. I saw one of the other races maybe 30 seconds behind, and just tried to hold that gap and hopefully get out-of-sight, and out-of-mind." His attack came over the top of a climb and down a descent, where superior descending skills created the winning gap. (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/evans-story-mid-state-gravel-grinder)

**Lynn Botelho's approach [ELITE]:** On technical descents, she focused on risk management rather than gaining time: "I knew I couldn't win the race here, but I could lose it. So my mantra was 'Stay Upright.'" She also noted having "nutrition dialed in just right for this one." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/lynns-story-mid-state-gravel-grinder)

**Descending as a differentiator [ELITE]:** Evan McGregor identified himself as "the most confident and skilled descender of our group (on the day, at least)" and used this to create separation, particularly on the rough embedded rock sections where less confident riders would slow down. (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/evans-story-mid-state-gravel-grinder)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Lynn Botelho [ELITE]:** "Even more happy to see and talk to so many other BaseCamp people. Most happy for being part of this great community and being able to keep learning and improving." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/lynns-story-mid-state-gravel-grinder)

**Evan McGregor [ELITE]:** Described the race as part of finding balance between family life and competition: "The winning finish was filled with joy... My kids would still love me no matter how I finished. Amanda would support and be proud of me as long as I gave my best. So the next step really is balance. Be a dad who deserves their love. Be a husband worth taking pride in and supporting. Express an aspect of that through cycling and its elements." He brought his family to the podium celebration.

**Beginner-friendly atmosphere:** HoboStephen [UNKNOWN] described it as his first race after only four months of riding, calling it "perfect" for newcomers and encouraging others "with apprehension for doing an event: just sign up for one that's reasonable to achieve and push yourself!"
