# MIGRATION GRAVEL RACE — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Maddy Nutt [ELITE]:** "On the first stage, I suffered a mechanical at 50km, which was unfortunate as it left me without a group to ride with on the flat and faster stage meaning I finished 4th in the women's race... The second stage was the most challenging of the 4 days with close to 3000m of climbing over the 168km course. On this day, I crossed the line in 3rd in the women's field, with a smile across my face declaring it to be the best bike course I have ever ridden." (https://www.parcours.cc/blogs/news/migration-gravel-race-report-contributed-by-maddy-nutt)

**Maddy Nutt [ELITE]:** "The final stage of the race was the highlight of my week. I started the day 31 minutes behind 2nd place on GC... With no further stages to pace towards, I completely gave it me all from the start of the stage and slipped away from the women's field through a rough and muddy section... Crossing the line over half an hour before the next woman, with a helicopter escorting me to the line was a surreal experience." (https://www.parcours.cc/blogs/news/migration-gravel-race-report-contributed-by-maddy-nutt)

**Maddy Nutt [ELITE]:** "My stomach was certainly not used to the food I was feeding it, but I knew that it was better to suffer slightly with an unhappy stomach if it meant I was getting enough fuel in me for the racing. With days over 8 hours in the saddle, this didn't leave too much of the day for faffing before the next stage." (https://www.parcours.cc/blogs/news/migration-gravel-race-report-contributed-by-maddy-nutt)

**Maddy Nutt [ELITE]:** "At points this was even rather overwhelming and I found myself tearing up behind my sunglasses, as I was cheered by huge crowds of children as I pushed my body to its limits to really see what it could do." (https://www.parcours.cc/blogs/news/migration-gravel-race-report-contributed-by-maddy-nutt)

**Sarah Sturm [ELITE]:** "We saw a giraffe and were like, 'should we stop?' and course we did... I didn't have much gas in the tank and did all she could to stay on Valentin's wheel." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/migration-gravel-race-results-sarah-sturm-and-hans-becking-celebrate-overall-victory-in-the-maasai-mara/)

**Hans Becking [ELITE]:** "Lukas won two stages, I won one, Lawrence won one, we had a super fun week. It doesn't matter what happens in the overall, we had a super fun week and enjoyed Kenya a lot, and I think that's the most important part." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/migration-gravel-race-results-sarah-sturm-and-hans-becking-celebrate-overall-victory-in-the-maasai-mara/)

**Chad Haga [ELITE]:** "I knew I was out of the GC race but Mattia has worked super hard all week and it's been a really good week with him and the Enough [Cycling] crew. I can call him a friend now and I wanted to do everything I could to see if he could hold on [to the GC]. We gave it a good shot, it was just unbelievably hard." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/migration-gravel-race-results-sarah-sturm-and-hans-becking-celebrate-overall-victory-in-the-maasai-mara/)

**Federico Damiani [ELITE]:** "Porca troia!" [shouted during thick mud section around km 20 of Stage 1] (https://rawcyclingmag.com/migration-gravel-race-2024-when-finishing-is-a-remarkable-feat/)

**Javi Angulo / RAW Cycling [ELITE]:** "The thick mud we found at around km 20 would put us even more out of our comfort zone... We had to ride, or walk, through something that was more like clay, with our wheels unable to keep turning. Removing the mud wasn't effective at all, as what lay ahead was more of the same. 'I have never been in this situation, what should I do?', we thought." (https://rawcyclingmag.com/migration-gravel-race-2024-when-finishing-is-a-remarkable-feat/)

**Javi Angulo / RAW Cycling [ELITE]:** "After 9 hours of riding [Stage 2], and taking into account that sunset in Kenya is around 7 PM all year round, it got dark by the time we had our recovery meal and headed to the primitive showers." (https://rawcyclingmag.com/migration-gravel-race-2024-when-finishing-is-a-remarkable-feat/)

**Luise Valentin [ELITE]:** "I could have gone harder but was enjoying riding with Sturm. She would have had to make up 20 minutes to take the GC from the Coloradan." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/migration-gravel-race-results-sarah-sturm-and-hans-becking-celebrate-overall-victory-in-the-maasai-mara/)

**Lukas Baum [ELITE]:** "Just 30 km in, Lukas Baum punctured and saw his lead in danger. Staying calm, he repaired swiftly, rejoined the leaders, and controlled the rest of the race." (https://gravelearthseries.com/2025/06/25/four-days-through-the-wild-the-spirit-of-migration-gravel/)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Haley Hunter Smith [ELITE]:** Used a "gravelized Supercaliber" — a full-suspension MTB fitted with a gravel handlebar — which "proved perfect for the rugged Maasai terrain." This was noted across three stage wins and overall victory in 2025. (https://gravelearthseries.com/2025/06/25/four-days-through-the-wild-the-spirit-of-migration-gravel/)

**Note:** Multiple sources describe the terrain as "on the cusp of gravel/MTB territory" with "several single track descents that really pushed the limits of a gravel bike" [ELITE source]. The 2024 winner used full suspension, suggesting this setup provides significant advantage for elite-level racing, though no recreational rider feedback is available for comparison.

**Maddy Nutt [ELITE]:** "A self supported race, this meant that both my bike and my body needed looking after in between each stage, and I was lucky to only suffer a few minor mechanicals that needed attention over the 4 days of racing." (https://www.parcours.cc/blogs/news/migration-gravel-race-report-contributed-by-maddy-nutt)

## Weather Experienced

**2024 Edition:** Heavy rain the night before Stage 1 created unprecedented mud conditions. "Once everyone passed by the registration desk and assembled their bike, the race briefing started. Everything, from the description of the stages to the logistic matters, was clearly explained, and as the organizers started wrapping up their speech, a heavy rain began. We didn't know the impact it would have, but it was clear that the terrain would not dry on time." [ELITE] (https://rawcyclingmag.com/migration-gravel-race-2024-when-finishing-is-a-remarkable-feat/)

**2024 Stage 1:** "Thick mud we found at around km 20" described as "more like clay" that prevented wheels from turning. [ELITE] (https://rawcyclingmag.com/migration-gravel-race-2024-when-finishing-is-a-remarkable-feat/)

**2024 Stage 2:** Rain during Stage 3 prep - "We could hear the rain hit our tents during the night before stage 3, and it was only the morning after that we remembered that we left our kit and shoes outside to dry." Camp was at 2,300m elevation with "quite cold" temperatures and "thick fog that only went away a few minutes before the start." [ELITE] (https://rawcyclingmag.com/migration-gravel-race-2024-when-finishing-is-a-remarkable-feat/)

**2024 Stage 4:** "The weather gods were on our side, and the forecast was no clouds, mild temperatures, and a tailwind all the way." [ELITE] (https://rawcyclingmag.com/migration-gravel-race-2024-when-finishing-is-a-remarkable-feat/)

**2025 Stage 3:** "Stage 3 aka the 'mud stage' took us through several river crossings and mud sections after a serious downfall the previous afternoon." [ELITE] (https://www.parcours.cc/blogs/news/migration-gravel-race-report-contributed-by-maddy-nutt)

**General conditions:** Race organizers noted 2024 edition had "more challenging conditions than normal due to flood-ravaged roads" and Mikel acknowledged "this edition was the toughest to date." [ELITE] (https://rawcyclingmag.com/migration-gravel-race-2024-when-finishing-is-a-remarkable-feat/)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Stage 1 - Mud conditions (2024):** "The first patches of mud were ok and could be avoided by choosing a different line. Not long after, there was no possible choice. We had to ride, or walk, through something that was more like clay, with our wheels unable to keep turning... the best choice was to hike a bike, dipping our legs in the mud and trying to make it to the other side, where we would stop for a good handful of minutes for damage assessment." [ELITE] (https://rawcyclingmag.com/migration-gravel-race-2024-when-finishing-is-a-remarkable-feat/)

**Stage 1 - Wind section:** "After the mud, it was time for block headwinds, which lasted for more than two hours." [ELITE] (https://rawcyclingmag.com/migration-gravel-race-2024-when-finishing-is-a-remarkable-feat/)

**Stage 1 characteristics:** "Vast, flat plains with fences, cattle, and wildlife tracks. Strong headwinds, known as 'the Dutch Mountains,' test endurance. Rugged type 4 to 5 gravel makes for a tough start." Distance: Leopard 150 km - 600m | Zebra 120 km - 500m (https://atta.travel/resource/the-ultimate-gravel-challenge--migration-gravel-race-returns--june-16---21--2025.html)

**Stage 2 - Climbing:** "The first half was on smooth gravel and the gradients were mellow, but as soon as we turned right after water stop 1 it got steeper and through narrower paths." Main climb is 18km long with summit at 2,630m elevation. [ELITE] (https://rawcyclingmag.com/migration-gravel-race-2024-when-finishing-is-a-remarkable-feat/)

**Stage 2 - Technical sections:** "Not long after hitting the top of the climb, we started a 50 km long section of singletracks and double tracks, including several technical segments and water crossings. It was a relentless up and down with barely any moment to recover, and we honestly think it was a bit too much for bikes without suspension." [ELITE] (https://rawcyclingmag.com/migration-gravel-race-2024-when-finishing-is-a-remarkable-feat/)

**Stage 2 characteristics:** "Iconic climb up Mlima wa Shetani followed by a thrilling single-track descent. Scenic but grueling ride through Loita Forest's winding trails. Potential wildlife encounters, including elephants, require ranger coordination. Unpredictable rain can turn trails into thick black clay." Distance: Leopard 170 km - 2200m | Zebra 100 km - 1500m (https://atta.travel/resource/the-ultimate-gravel-challenge--migration-gravel-race-returns--june-16---21--2025.html)

**Stage 2 - Wildlife/obstacles:** "It wasn't until water stop 2, located at kilometer 114, that we finally found proper gravel paths, but the hurdles did not stop there as this time what prevented us from keeping a constant pace were the many cows and sheep on our way." [ELITE] (https://rawcyclingmag.com/migration-gravel-race-2024-when-finishing-is-a-remarkable-feat/)

**Stage 2 - Dust conditions:** "The following section was characterized by the dust that prevented us from seeing what there was three meters ahead, making us wonder if it was riskier to ride in a group simply relying on the line chosen by the rider in front, or to be on our own so we could have a bit more time to react." [ELITE] (https://rawcyclingmag.com/migration-gravel-race-2024-when-finishing-is-a-remarkable-feat/)

**Stage 3 characteristics:** "High-speed black gravel sections allow for faster riding. Bridge crossings require caution due to hidden dips and holes. Open plains with abundant wildlife, from wildebeest to gazelles." Distance: Leopard 140 km - 1600m | Zebra 100 km - 900m (https://atta.travel/resource/the-ultimate-gravel-challenge--migration-gravel-race-returns--june-16---21--2025.html)

**Stage 3 (2024):** "Stage 3 was mainly gravel, the real gravel. That allowed for higher speeds and therefore more smiles during the day... while riding in an exposed area on some sort of plateau, we saw dozens of wildebeest in the never-ending migration from the Masai Mara to the Serengeti and back." [ELITE] (https://rawcyclingmag.com/migration-gravel-race-2024-when-finishing-is-a-remarkable-feat/)

**Stage 3 (2025):** "Perhaps the most tactically complex day, Stage 3 was a mix of narrow singletrack, cattle crossings and unpredictable river fords. Riders waded through knee-deep water, navigated herds, and dodged thorn bushes as nature took center stage." [ELITE] (https://gravelearthseries.com/2025/06/25/four-days-through-the-wild-the-spirit-of-migration-gravel/)

**Stage 4 characteristics:** "One last tough climb through the Loita Hills before a thrilling descent. Expansive Mara plains provide a scenic but demanding finale. Hydration and pacing are key to conquering the last leg of the journey." Distance: Leopard 150 km - 1100m | Zebra 100 km - 750m (https://atta.travel/resource/the-ultimate-gravel-challenge--migration-gravel-race-returns--june-16---21--2025.html)

**General terrain assessment:** "This was without a doubt, the most challenging terrain I've ridden in a race, and with four stages, this was definitely something that added to cumulative fatigue." [ELITE] (https://www.parcours.cc/blogs/news/migration-gravel-race-report-contributed-by-maddy-nutt)

**Shared roads:** "All paths are open to other users, including wildlife, cattle, herders, boda bodas (motorbike taxis), safari jeeps, and local villagers, so riders must exercise caution, stay on the left side of the road, and yield to wildlife when necessary." (https://www.migrationgravelrace.com/)

**Comparison to Paris-Roubaix:** "Laurens ten Dam described the opening part of Stage 1 of Migration a couple years ago as '30km of Carrefour de l'Arbre on rocks'" [UNKNOWN level source] (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/1dn7dj3/brutal_gravel_wildebeests/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Maddy Nutt [ELITE] - Multi-day pacing strategy:** "My target for the week was a strong podium finish, and I knew that I needed to control my enthusiasm to race fast each day and pace my efforts across the week, so on the third day I reeled in my effort towards the end of the stage, thinking towards the final stage (188km) the next day, finishing in 3rd." (https://www.parcours.cc/blogs/news/migration-gravel-race-report-contributed-by-maddy-nutt)

**Maddy Nutt [ELITE] - Final stage strategy:** "With no further stages to pace towards, I completely gave it me all from the start of the stage and slipped away from the women's field through a rough and muddy section. With 188km and a decent amount of climbing, I knew that the day would be challenging, but with a lot of drive intrinsically and my legs feeling good, I continued to push over the stage, increasing the time gap on all the women behind me." (https://www.parcours.cc/blogs/news/migration-gravel-race-report-contributed-by-maddy-nutt)

**Maddy Nutt [ELITE] - Altitude adaptation:** "The race was all at altitudes above 2000m, with climbing on stage 2 taking us closer to 3000m. This presented another challenge to riders, with less oxygen in the air severely impacting the ability to push out power. I found that initially my body struggled with the altitude, but that it quickly adapted and I was no longer as conscious of how it inhibited my performance." (https://www.parcours.cc/blogs/news/migration-gravel-race-report-contributed-by-maddy-nutt)

**General [ELITE] - Stage 2 difficulty:** "50% of the Leopard riders followed [the] escape route" on Stage 2 after 9 hours of riding, indicating this is a critical attrition point. (https://rawcyclingmag.com/migration-gravel-race-2024-when-finishing-is-a-remarkable-feat/)

**Lukas Baum [ELITE] - Stage 1 tactics:** "Teaming up with Hans Becking (Buff-Megamo), the duo worked the echelons to perfection, arriving together and sharing the day's victory—a powerful gesture of mutual respect." (https://gravelearthseries.com/2025/06/25/four-days-through-the-wild-the-spirit-of-migration-gravel/)

**Haley Hunter Smith [ELITE] - Building into the race:** "In the women's field, Rwanda's Xaverine Nirere (Team Amani) launched an explosive debut... But just behind, Haley Hunter Smith was lurking—settling in, learning the land, and preparing her move." Stage 2: "Haley Hunter Smith showed her true strength. Capitalizing on the long climbs and high heat, she dropped Nirere with a measured but crushing effort, taking both the stage win and the overall lead—a jersey she would never relinquish." (https://gravelearthseries.com/2025/06/25/four-days-through-the-wild-the-spirit-of-migration-gravel/)

**Daily schedule timing [ELITE]:** "Logistically the race required great organisation and preparation and efficiency each day from riders with start times as early as 6:30am, which required pre 5am alarms." (https://www.parcours.cc/blogs/news/migration-gravel-race-report-contributed-by-maddy-nutt)

**Daily routine [ELITE]:** "Alarm at 5.15 AM. Queue for breakfast. Fill bidons and hydration pack. Get changed. Warm-up (this part only lasted for a day, as for the following stages we squeezed our time in the tent). 7.30 AM start. And then we push our bikes for an average of 7 hours a day." (https://rawcyclingmag.com/migration-gravel-race-2024-when-finishing-is-a-remarkable-feat/)

**Final stage approach [ELITE]:** "The last stage was supposed to be a difficult task... There was no possible shortcut. All of us had to do the 140 km... The good thing is that the weather gods were on our side, and the forecast was no clouds, mild temperatures, and a tailwind all the way." (https://rawcyclingmag.com/migration-gravel-race-2024-when-finishing-is-a-remarkable-feat/)

**Stage 3 loop strategy [ELITE]:** "Unlike the other stages, which went from point A to point B, the route for that day was a loop. Aware of it, we went for a conservative approach during the first half of the stage, where we enjoyed some nice tailwind, because we knew that it would later turn into a headwind as we headed back to the camp." (https://rawcyclingmag.com/migration-gravel-race-2024-when-finishing-is-a-remarkable-feat/)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Stage 2 - Primary attrition point:** "We were told that 50% of the Leopard riders followed this escape route" after Stage 2's 9-hour effort with 50km of technical singletrack/doubletrack. [ELITE] (https://rawcyclingmag.com/migration-gravel-race-2024-when-finishing-is-a-remarkable-feat/)

**Cumulative fatigue:** "Things didn't change much for the remainder of the stage, and our general thought while ticking off the kilometers, mainly riding on our own, was something like 'If I'm already so exhausted before finishing stage 1, how will I make it through the rest of the days?'" [ELITE] (https://rawcyclingmag.com/migration-gravel-race-2024-when-finishing-is-a-remarkable-feat/)

**Stage 3 - Fatigue visibility:** "Testing riders' resilience, the undulating course was challenging and at this point fatigue from earlier stages appeared in riders who had taken the first few days harder." [ELITE] (https://www.parcours.cc/blogs/news/migration-gravel-race-report-contributed-by-maddy-nutt)

**Mechanicals:** Stage 1 mechanical cost Maddy Nutt [ELITE] 4th place and time on GC when it "left me without a group to ride with on the flat and faster stage." Lukas Baum [ELITE] punctured with 25km to go in Stage 4 but managed to repair and rejoin. (https://www.parcours.cc/blogs/news/migration-gravel-race-report-contributed-by-maddy-nutt) (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/migration-gravel-race-results-sarah-sturm-and-hans-becking-celebrate-overall-victory-in-the-maasai-mara/)

**Food/nutrition adaptation:** "Another challenge faced by participants was adapting to the food, and simply consuming enough to fuel the racing and recovery each day, as well as being careful with consuming only clean water." [ELITE] (https://www.parcours.cc/blogs/news/migration-gravel-race-report-contributed-by-maddy-nutt)

**2024 conditions specifically:** Race was described as "the toughest to date" with "flood-ravaged roads" creating harder conditions than normal years. [ELITE] (https://rawcyclingmag.com/migration-gravel-race-2024-when-finishing-is-a-remarkable-feat/)

**General finishing difficulty:** From multiple elite sources: "Nearly 200 riders from 35 countries celebrated the conclusion" in 2024, and "From Cape Epic champions to former WorldTour pros, everyone who competed at this year's Migration Gravel Race said that the event was one of the hardest they'd ever done." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/migration-gravel-race-results-sarah-sturm-and-hans-becking-celebrate-overall-victory-in-the-maasai-mara/)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Local support:** "Along the route, there were thousands of kids shouting 'Jambo!', making our day on the saddle even more pleasant." [ELITE] (https://rawcyclingmag.com/migration-gravel-race-2024-when-finishing-is-a-remarkable-feat/)

**Maddy Nutt [ELITE]:** "Riding through the Mara, we had constant children cheers of 'jambo' (hello) and were only greeted with huge enthusiasm and celebration. At points this was even rather overwhelming and I found myself tearing up behind my sunglasses, as I was cheered by huge crowds of children as I pushed my body to its limits." (https://www.parcours.cc/blogs/news/migration-gravel-race-report-contributed-by-maddy-nutt)

**Camaraderie formed:** "The bonds forged over four days of riding, camping, and commiserating in the Maasai Mara helped ease the painful parts. As the Maasai men who worked as motorcycle drivers and support staff gave their final blessing by the Mara River on Friday evening, smiles trumped scars." [ELITE] (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/migration-gravel-race-results-sarah-sturm-and-hans-becking-celebrate-overall-victory-in-the-maasai-mara/)

**Camp experience:** "Nights at the wild camp are filled with stories around the fire, recovery under Mara's starlit sky, and the anticipation of the next day's adventure." (https://atta.travel/resource/the-ultimate-gravel-challenge--migration-gravel-race-returns--june-16---21--2025.html)

**Maddy Nutt [ELITE] on finish:** "On crossing the line, I was overwhelmed by hugs and celebrations from friends new and old, and those who had believed more in my abilities than myself! ... the three of us stood grinning but rather overwhelmed, as the Maasai warriors dressed us in their blankets and celebrated our result with chanting." (https://www.parcours.cc/blogs/news/migration-gravel-race-report-contributed-by-maddy-nutt)

**Camp logistics:** "Mechanics, masseurs and all the local Maasai community involved in looking after us at the camp would spend the rest of the day, and a big share of the night, making sure that we recover as much as possible from the effort exerted." [ELITE] (https://rawcyclingmag.com/migration-gravel-race-2024-when-finishing-is-a-remarkable-feat/)

**Finish line atmosphere:** "Crossing the line over half an hour before the next woman, with a helicopter escorting me to the line was a surreal experience." [ELITE] (https://www.parcours.cc/blogs/news/migration-gravel-race-report-contributed-by-maddy-nutt)

**Wildlife experience:** "Every night they set up in tents somewhere in park, really out in the wilderness. You begin to understand the different sounds between a wildebeest and a hyena. A local Maasai guy sets up a fire, he has his spear and you trust him because he lives here, he knows this stuff. I've never had a camping experience like it." - Mikel Delagrange describing recon (https://velo.outsideonline.com/road/road-culture/kenyas-migration-gravel-race-this-isnt-another-feel-good-african-development-story)

**Maddy Nutt [ELITE]:** "I feel so lucky to have been able to race the migration gravel race, and the people and atmosphere of the race is something I simply cannot do justice through writing." (https://www.parcours.cc/blogs/news/migration-gravel-race-report-contributed-by-maddy-nutt)

**Race philosophy:** "Migration isn't just a race—it's a journey through untamed wilderness. Riders pass zebras and giraffes, sleep under starlit skies, and face terrain that tests body and mind. The Maasai Mara is not a backdrop; it's a protagonist. Racing here is about more than watts and strategy—it's about connection, humility, and respect for the land and the people." (https://gravelearthseries.com/2025/06/25/four-days-through-the-wild-the-spirit-of-migration-gravel/)

**Event character:** "The Migration Gravel Race (MGR) is hailed as the hardest and wildest gravel race in the world" and described as "Not all Kilometers are equal. You will be tested." (https://www.migrationgravelrace.com/)

**Community development aspect:** The race is organized in partnership with Team Amani, "Focused on developing cycling opportunities in East Africa" and working with the local Maasai community to support "sustainable tourism and community development."
