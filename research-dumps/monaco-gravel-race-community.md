## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Mads Wurtz Schmidt [ELITE]:** "This victory is incredibly meaningful to me. The Monaco Gravel course is not only beautiful but also incredibly challenging. To come out on top and secure my second UCI Gravel World Series win this season is a testament to the hard work and dedication I've put into training."

**Jan Stöckli [UNKNOWN]:** "I had just received my new BMC gravel bike on Thursday and hadn't tested it yet — I was curious (and slightly anxious) to see how it would perform. To my relief, it felt fast, agile, and surprisingly responsive right out of the gate. The recon ride went smoothly, although the relentless vibrations and shocks during the climbs were tough on the muscles." (https://www.tudorprocycling.com/post/gravel-diary-monaco-gravel-race-uci)

**Jan Stöckli [UNKNOWN]:** "Race morning started at 7:00 a.m. with breakfast — pasta for me, muesli for Simon. We rode over the Col de la Madone to the starting line. Gilles, our mechanic, asked if I was nervous. At that moment, I wasn't. But as the start time approached, I could feel the tension rise. Once the race began, I felt great. I managed to stick with the front group on the first climb and was amazed at how strong the field was on the ascents. The course was brutal — 120 kilometers with 2,600 meters of climbing. A true mountain test. After about a lap and a half, the effort caught up with me. I started to fade and couldn't maintain the early pace. I had been fighting for 5th place, but from then on, my only goal was to make it to the finish." (https://www.tudorprocycling.com/post/gravel-diary-monaco-gravel-race-uci)

**Jan Stöckli [UNKNOWN]:** "This race was a big step forward. I learned a lot and came away with many positive impressions. The BMC gravel bike exceeded my expectations - it climbed and descended with ease. My performance started strong but dropped later, which gives me plenty to work on." (https://www.tudorprocycling.com/post/gravel-diary-monaco-gravel-race-uci)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**45mm tires [UNKNOWN LEVEL]:** Official course description recommends "tires ideally in 45mm are recommended to facilitate passages in certain sectors more stony than others." (https://www.granfondoguide.com/Events/Index/12348/monaco-gravel-race)

**BMC gravel bike [UNKNOWN]:** Jan Stöckli reported the BMC gravel bike "felt fast, agile, and surprisingly responsive right out of the gate" and "exceeded my expectations - it climbed and descended with ease."

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Vibrations and surface quality:** Jan Stöckli [UNKNOWN] noted "the relentless vibrations and shocks during the climbs were tough on the muscles" during the reconnaissance ride. (https://www.tudorprocycling.com/post/gravel-diary-monaco-gravel-race-uci)

**Course characteristics:** Official description states "The Monaco Gravel Race UCI courses do not have any traps, all parts are rolling. You will not push your bike. No single tracks are taken in order to emphasize safety and remain in the logic of practicing Gravel. A development adapted to the mountain and tires ideally in 45mm are recommended to facilitate passages in certain sectors more stony than others." (https://www.granfondoguide.com/Events/Index/12348/monaco-gravel-race)

**Col de Braus ascent:** The course tackles "the iconic Col de Braus, famously scaled by Tour de France cyclists in 2024" via gravel tracks. The climb is divided into two parts: Col des Boeufs (with potential supporter presence, then descent with Mercantour mountain views) and Farghet Plateau (climbing through forest to reach the plateau, then pushing to the Col de Braus summit). (https://ucigravelworldseries.com/en/monaco/)

**Scenic descent:** After Col de Braus, riders experience "a series of exhilarating descents, both on asphalt roads and gravel tracks" through the Col du Castillon and near Saint Agnès (the highest hilltop village on the Mediterranean coast). (https://ucigravelworldseries.com/en/monaco/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing
