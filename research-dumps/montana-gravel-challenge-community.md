# MONTANA GRAVEL CHALLENGE — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Peter L [COMPETITIVE]:** "Friday we were out setting up the course for the afternoon time trial plus the Saturday course. Between this morning when I decided to shorten the TT a bit and when we actually raced it got a lot wetter so definitely good call to avoid the twisty descent that was already pretty fucked before it rained more." (https://bikingmt.blogspot.com/2024/04/montana-gravel-challenge-2024.html)

**Peter L [COMPETITIVE]:** "First time racing outside with a power meter and am ok with my numbers - 338 average and 361np for ~20min. I can average a higher HR for that amount of time and was asking myself if I should be pedaling harder some of the time but it's rolling and and uphill finish so having something left for that is good." (https://bikingmt.blogspot.com/2024/04/montana-gravel-challenge-2024.html)

**Peter L [COMPETITIVE]:** "Day 2 has been the long gravel stage of the race with 3 being a more road circuit. This year we didn't do the long gravel loop because it's a lot of logistics and probably kind of dangerous especially toward the end of the 1 lane gravel road where you're descending around blind corners." (https://bikingmt.blogspot.com/2024/04/montana-gravel-challenge-2024.html)

**Peter L [COMPETITIVE]:** "So I think 9th overall but Matt beat me to win 40+. Was a little disappointed because I spent the race not really where I wanted to be, plus dressed for cold and rain which was forecast but didn't really happen, and by the time the hard pedaling began I didn't really have an opportunity to try to take off my gloves and jacket. Essentially my race summary could be 'hot, flappy, bad tactics, bad positioning.'" (https://bikingmt.blogspot.com/2024/04/montana-gravel-challenge-2024.html)

**Peter L [COMPETITIVE]:** "Yesterday morning I felt like garbage and my watch told me my 'training readiness' was 14. This morning it said 7 but I felt better and had more sleep." (https://bikingmt.blogspot.com/2024/04/montana-gravel-challenge-2024.html)

**Peter L [COMPETITIVE]:** "Yesterday I had a pretty good but not good enough average power for the last 40min, today I had a normalized power of 305w for 2 hours plus a best 1min, 2min, and 5min for the season." (https://bikingmt.blogspot.com/2024/04/montana-gravel-challenge-2024.html)

## Event Structure & Format

The Montana Gravel Challenge is a **three-day, three-stage race** held annually in late April/early May in Missoula/Huson, Montana. The event has evolved significantly over the years:

**2024-2025 Format:**
- **Stage 1 (Friday):** Time Trial - ~9-11 miles, 756 feet of climbing, 100% gravel/dirt
- **Stage 2 (Saturday):** Southside/Petty Road - 52-56 miles, ~3,000 feet of climbing, 38 miles paved/18 miles gravel
- **Stage 3 (Sunday):** Rocky Mountain Roubaix - 4-lap circuit, 45 miles, 1,711 feet of climbing, 27 miles paved/18 miles gravel

**Divisions:**
- **Competitive Division:** Traditional racing with waves, podiums, and omnium points
- **Recreation Division (NEW 2026):** Mass start at your own pace, finish all three stages, get results but no podiums
- **Virtual Division (NEW 2026):** Complete courses on your own schedule, submit Strava rides
- **Paracyclist Division:** Separate category with reduced entry fee

**Historical Notes:**
- The event was previously called "Montana Hell Ride" and has been running since at least 2014
- Earlier versions (2018) included a 4th stage for juniors
- The 2022 format had competitive vs. recreational splits within the same event
- Course lengths and routes have been adjusted year-to-year based on conditions

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Peter L [COMPETITIVE]:** "Rode my new orbea terra with road wheels and 34mm corsa n.exts at like 42/46 psi. Felt pretty decent on the slippery descents and corners. Going to ride same bike setup all weekend I think. Tomorrow is mainly road but with a few dirt parts and it'll be wet and there are potholes and stuff." (https://bikingmt.blogspot.com/2024/04/montana-gravel-challenge-2024.html)

**Peter L [COMPETITIVE]:** "The bike, wheel, and tire setup was perfect all weekend though. The guy who hosts the race had bike wash stations in his yard so after every stage I hosed off my bike, put it in the stand and wiped everything down good, then put some silca super secret on the chain every night once it dried out. Even after the nasty slick mud section on day 2 my shifting felt good and drivetrain seemed quiet." (https://bikingmt.blogspot.com/2024/04/montana-gravel-challenge-2024.html)

**Note:** Peter's setup (34mm tires at 42/46 psi on a road/gravel bike) was optimal for competitive racing with mixed pavement/gravel. His meticulous daily maintenance routine was key to reliable performance across three muddy stages.

## Weather Experienced

**2024 (April 26-28):** Heavy rain and cold conditions throughout the weekend. Peter L noted: "This weekend was the 3-day montana gravel challenge, and it's raining." Course conditions deteriorated significantly - the TT was shortened Friday morning to avoid "the twisty descent that was already pretty fucked before it rained more." Stage 2 featured a "muddy and slick" section. Stage 3's mud climb "was a little iffy and it has only gotten worse over the last few days of periodic rain and cool temps." Peter described being "dressed for cold and rain which was forecast" but ended up overheating during efforts. (https://bikingmt.blogspot.com/2024/04/montana-gravel-challenge-2024.html)

**General timing:** The event is held in late April/early May in Montana, which appears to be a shoulder season with significant weather variability and mud potential.

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Stage 1 (Time Trial):**
- Rolling terrain with an uphill finish
- Twisty descent section (sometimes cut in wet conditions)
- Course marshals at intersections with car traffic
- 100% gravel/dirt surface
(https://bikingmt.blogspot.com/2024/04/montana-gravel-challenge-2024.html)

**Stage 2 (Southside/Petty Road):**
**Peter L [COMPETITIVE]:** "One of the dirt sections might get cut out depending on how much it's raining. It was greasy this morning then will only get worse." The stage includes "one pretty gradually uphill for like 10mi, the next shorter with more climbing. The 2nd section was muddy and slick" with "a short dirt climb near the end." (https://bikingmt.blogspot.com/2024/04/montana-gravel-challenge-2024.html)

**Stage 3 (Rocky Mountain Roubaix):**
**Peter L [COMPETITIVE]:** "Day 3 was the 'road race' with an out on dirt to a 10mi circuit that's mostly paved, with a climb on mud but thankfully the descent side was dry. This mud climb is a section I cut out of the TT on friday morning because it was a little iffy and it has only gotten worse over the last few days of periodic rain and cool temps... After the climb and descent on the circuit... it's about 2k generally uphill to the finish." (https://bikingmt.blogspot.com/2024/04/montana-gravel-challenge-2024.html)

**Infrastructure:**
- One stocked aid station per stage with water and nutrition
- Poor cell connectivity noted in 2022 (results posted end of each day)
- Bike wash stations provided at race HQ
- Portapotties and running potable water at venue

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Peter L [COMPETITIVE] - Stage 1 (TT, ~20 minutes):** "338 average and 361np for ~20min. I can average a higher HR for that amount of time and was asking myself if I should be pedaling harder some of the time but it's rolling and and uphill finish so having something left for that is good." (https://bikingmt.blogspot.com/2024/04/montana-gravel-challenge-2024.html)

**Peter L [COMPETITIVE] - Stage 2 (Positioning matters):** "I was out of position, went super hard chasing onto the lead group, then was almost immediately dropped up a short dirt climb near the end. Our 2nd group of 3 stayed away... Was a little disappointed because I spent the race not really where I wanted to be... Essentially my race summary could be 'hot, flappy, bad tactics, bad positioning.'" (https://bikingmt.blogspot.com/2024/04/montana-gravel-challenge-2024.html)

**Peter L [COMPETITIVE] - Stage 3 (Pacing for circuit race, 2 hours):** "Yesterday I had a pretty good but not good enough average power for the last 40min, today I had a normalized power of 305w for 2 hours plus a best 1min, 2min, and 5min for the season... Things slowed down a bit and I went up the side, not attacking super hard, but getting a gap and going for it. Everyone had been working except me and kind of blew things up." Peter conserved energy by sitting in the chase group for the last lap after being dropped earlier, then attacked in the final 2k uphill. (https://bikingmt.blogspot.com/2024/04/montana-gravel-challenge-2024.html)

**Clothing strategy:** Overdressing for forecasted cold/rain can backfire when racing intensity picks up. Peter noted being unable to remove gloves and jacket once hard efforts began, leading to overheating issues.

**Recovery between stages:** Peter's "training readiness" metrics dropped dramatically during the event (14 after stage 1, 7 before stage 3), but he notes feeling better with more sleep despite the poor readiness score.

## DNF Risk Factors

**Course modifications due to conditions:** Race organizers actively shorten or reroute dangerous sections in poor weather. In 2024, the TT was shortened to avoid a problematic descent, and certain dirt sections on Stage 2 were considered for removal due to mud. The long gravel loop historically used on Stage 2 was eliminated entirely due to "logistics and probably kind of dangerous especially toward the end of the 1 lane gravel road where you're descending around blind corners." (https://bikingmt.blogspot.com/2024/04/montana-gravel-challenge-2024.html)

**Mechanical reliability in mud:** Peter L [COMPETITIVE] emphasized the importance of nightly bike maintenance: "Even after the nasty slick mud section on day 2 my shifting felt good and drivetrain seemed quiet" after washing and relubing each night. This suggests mud can quickly degrade shifting/drivetrain performance without proper care. (https://bikingmt.blogspot.com/2024/04/montana-gravel-challenge-2024.html)

**Getting dropped:** Competitive riders can be dropped on short punchy climbs even after successfully chasing back to lead groups. Peter noted being "almost immediately dropped up a short dirt climb near the end" of Stage 2 after a hard chase effort.

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Local organization:** The event is organized by the Missoula cycling community. Peter L [COMPETITIVE] was involved in course setup: "Friday we were out setting up the course for the afternoon time trial plus the Saturday course." (https://bikingmt.blogspot.com/2024/04/montana-gravel-challenge-2024.html)

**Race venue hospitality:** "The guy who hosts the race had bike wash stations in his yard" and allows onsite camping/trailer camping at the race HQ (18450 Six Mile Road, Huson, MT). Bjorn, owner of Big Sky Brewery, hosts the race on his property. (https://bikingmt.blogspot.com/2024/04/montana-gravel-challenge-2024.html, https://www.bikesignup.com/Race/MT/Huson/MontanaHellRide)

**Accommodations:** City Center Motel in downtown Missoula is recommended by the race, with the owner Keyvin being "a wealth of knowledge about local roads and trails" and a regular participant in local races. (https://www.bikesignup.com/Race/MT/Huson/MontanaHellRide)

**Awards structure:** All finishers of all three stages receive an official Montana Gravel Challenge hat. Awards go to top 3 overall male/female plus extensive age group categories (12-14, 15-16, 17-18, 19-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70+, and Paracyclist). Omnium points are awarded across all stages. (https://www.bikesignup.com/Race/MT/Huson/MontanaHellRide)

**Competitive field:** The 2024 race included "the actual pro MTB racer" in 4th place on the TT, junior racers competing with masters riders, speed skaters, and strong age-groupers. Peter L [COMPETITIVE] finished 8th overall and 1st in 40+ in the TT. (https://bikingmt.blogspot.com/2024/04/montana-gravel-challenge-2024.html)
