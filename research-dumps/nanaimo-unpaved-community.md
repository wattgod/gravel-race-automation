## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

The Impulso course features **relatively flat terrain with limited steep climbing**. Based on race results showing tight finish times and percentage differences, the course appears to reward sustained power rather than climbing ability.

**Course profile characteristics:**
- Campbell River XC course (different event, same region) had "less than 180m of elevation gain per lap made the overall course feel pan-flat" [ELITE] (https://bookofchad.ca/category/race-reports/)
- Cumberland area features "long and wide grass straights, tight corners, and mountain bike terrain" [ELITE] (https://bookofchad.ca/category/race-reports/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Fast starts are critical [ELITE]:** From regional race experience: "The start went up a fire road, and the first minute of the ride started quickly, not xco quick, but 400 watts average for the first minute quick. I managed to sit on as the front group got strung out" - Chad Grice [ELITE] discussing similar Vancouver Island races (https://bookofchad.ca/category/race-reports/)

**Pacing context for Impulso distance [ELITE]:** The winning time of 2:13:10 for 40km suggests an average speed of ~18 km/h, with top finishers clustered within 5 minutes of the winner. The field spreads significantly after the top 10, with times ranging up to 3:46:26 for the last finisher.
