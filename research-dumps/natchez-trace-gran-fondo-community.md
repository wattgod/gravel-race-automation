# NATCHEZ TRACE GRAN FONDO — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Pete Dusel [UNKNOWN]:** "After my miserable showing on my LOL 1000k this year, although the web site said the ride was full, I decided to apply for the Natchez Trace 1000k... The route was simple, except for a few miles for the start/finish and controls, follow the Natchez Trace Parkway to Red Dog Road at mile post 140, and return." (http://www.distancerider.net/stories/NT1000k/NT1000kRideStory.html)

**Pete Dusel [UNKNOWN]:** "The Natchez Trace Parkway is a lovely place to ride. Not terribly hilly, but generally rolling enough to keep it interesting. A great tandem route. Traffic very light, and except for the Tupelo vicinity, the drivers are very well behaved, giving us a full lane when passing, and waiting patiently when they couldn't pass. Not a pot hole the entire length we rode and, in general, the pavement in excellent condition." (http://www.distancerider.net/stories/NT1000k/NT1000kRideStory.html)

**Pete Dusel [UNKNOWN]:** "Where I did lose a lot of time was Tupelo at about mile 190. I rolled in there with Dave Buzzee, who I'd ridden all day with, at about 20:00... I'd burned up over two hours there... I blew over two hours in Tupelo." (http://www.distancerider.net/stories/NT1000k/NT1000kRideStory.html)

**Pete Dusel [UNKNOWN]:** "Avoid Tupelo on a bike at all costs!! Even the traffic on the Parkway is miserable near Tupelo! And I even saluted in the direction of the King's childhood home! Heck, just avoid Tupelo!" (http://www.distancerider.net/stories/NT1000k/NT1000kRideStory.html)

**pwandoff [COMPETITIVE]:** "I completed my first century this year with roughly 4,600 ft climb with a majority between 40 - 80 miles. I finished well and pleased with my experience. So much so, I'll be doing two in 2019." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/best-training-plan-for-100mile-gran-fondo-race/1387)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Natchez Trace Parkway characteristics** (from 1000k experience): "Not terribly hilly, but generally rolling enough to keep it interesting... No stop signs, and except for a few tiny roads in Mississippi, no cross roads at grade. They're all handled with overpasses. Being that far south, there are no shoulders on the road either." (http://www.distancerider.net/stories/NT1000k/NT1000kRideStory.html)

**Surface conditions:** "Not a pot hole the entire length we rode and, in general, the pavement in excellent condition." (http://www.distancerider.net/stories/NT1000k/NT1000kRideStory.html)

**100-mile Gran Fondo route profile [COMPETITIVE rider planning]:** "The route is quite flat in general just 2500ft over 100 miles. The hills that are part of the course are at the first and last thirds with a long flat drag in the middle." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/best-training-plan-for-100mile-gran-fondo-race/1387)

**Tupelo area specifics:** "On a four lane stretch of Main Street, Tupelo, with little traffic... a semi did a tight swing around us and almost toasted my riding partner with the back of his trailer. For no apparent reason. One of only two less than pleasant experiences I had with motorists on the entire ride." (http://www.distancerider.net/stories/NT1000k/NT1000kRideStory.html)

## Weather Experienced

**September 23-25, 2010 (1000k event):** "First, the official high for Nashville - Tupelo and south on the first two days was 94. I showed that on my bike, along with one spike up to 101... The temp was about the same as LOL this year, and a bit cooler than the GRR (2001). This was the first long hot ride I've ever done end of summer... the temp was surprisingly tolerable, and I was a lot more comfortable than I'd been on GRR(2001) and LOL(2010)." (http://www.distancerider.net/stories/NT1000k/NT1000kRideStory.html)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Early pace management [UNKNOWN level, 1000k distance]:** "The first day went well. I rolled out with Dave Buzzee from Ohio. We hit it off and spent the day drafting each other... Although we were always behind the center of the main peloton, we were banking time, on schedule." (http://www.distancerider.net/stories/NT1000k/NT1000kRideStory.html)

**Nutrition strategy [UNKNOWN level, hot conditions]:** "I've been doing a lot of riding since LOL, and trying all the Hammer products that were left over. Heed and Sustained energy seem to work for me, and, although I didn't use any enduralytes this trip, I was aggressive with the Heed. Bottom line, no cramping, and only one case of stomach 'distress'... While I recovered from that, I was still able to drink Heed and Sustained energy, so energy level was good." (http://www.distancerider.net/stories/NT1000k/NT1000kRideStory.html)

**Time loss warning:** "Where I did lose a lot of time was Tupelo at about mile 190... after a bunch of hemming and hawing, and me calling Marcia (she was a general support volunteer) for them to figure out how they'd get back, and me deciding what to do... I'd burned up over two hours there." (http://www.distancerider.net/stories/NT1000k/NT1000kRideStory.html)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Limited services on Parkway:** "The downside is that there is not so much as one soda machine on the parkway. Nothing. Nada. Zilch. Zip. There are rest rooms here and there with flush toilets, mostly open all night, and drinkable but generally foul tasting warm water, likely from a heavy mineral content." (http://www.distancerider.net/stories/NT1000k/NT1000kRideStory.html)

**Overnight closure warning:** "Other than that, you must exit the parkway for anything else, and long stretches have nothing to exit to. Except for a couple of places, the towns next to the Parkway close up completely from about 10PM to 6AM, so best be stocked if you're going all night." (http://www.distancerider.net/stories/NT1000k/NT1000kRideStory.html)

**Food safety in heat:** Pete experienced "stomach 'distress', likely caused by a spicy chicken fried steak sandwich I ate late the first day, after carrying it in my pocket for about six hours, and the water at Pharr Mounds, rather than the heat." (http://www.distancerider.net/stories/NT1000k/NT1000kRideStory.html)

**Sleep deprivation:** "By then I was pretty exhausted from the short sleep the night before, etc, etc, and I took frequent naps on the side of the road." (http://www.distancerider.net/stories/NT1000k/NT1000kRideStory.html)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Local support at controls:** "We rolled into The Collinwood control at about 10:40, to find a group of cyclists still there. The folks at the Collinwood Exxon greeted us warmly, with good food and a cyclists special." (http://www.distancerider.net/stories/NT1000k/NT1000kRideStory.html)

**Optional store stop hospitality:** "That was 'Patties One Stop', and they were very pleasant... Clumsy me, lifting it from the case I knocked a Pecan Pie onto, well, pretty much all over the floor. Sheepishly I picked up the pieces, and the water, and carried them to the register. I was more than happy to pay for it, but the clerk wisked it away, and wouldn't take anything for it... She scanned the ice water, when it didn't show as being on file, she looked at me and said 'is $2.50 OK?'" (http://www.distancerider.net/stories/NT1000k/NT1000kRideStory.html)
