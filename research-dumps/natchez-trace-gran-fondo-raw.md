# NATCHEZ TRACE GRAN FONDO - RAW RESEARCH DUMP

## CRITICAL FINDING: RACE IDENTITY CLARIFICATION

Based on my search results, I must clarify an important distinction: **there is no gravel race called "Natchez Trace Gran Fondo"** as a single unified event with the specifications you provided (65 miles, 3500 ft elevation).

What exists instead are **multiple separate cycling events** related to the Natchez Trace route:

## RECOMMENDATION

To get accurate information, you would need to:

1. **Verify the exact race name** - Is it possibly the "Natchez Bicycle Classic de Gran Fondo" (the only May 30, 2026 event I found)?
2. **Confirm if this is a gravel race** - The search results show the May 30 event is classified as "Road," not gravel
3. **Check the official race website directly** for current 2026 details, registration, and participant information
4. **Clarify the 65-mile distance** - This doesn't match any single-day event I found (the 63-mile option on May 30 is the closest)

The Natchez Trace area clearly has significant cycling interest with multiple tour operators and events, but I cannot confirm a gravel race matching your parameters exists as currently described.
