# NED GRAVEL — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Lailah [ELITE]:** "Ned Gravel was everything it promised to be and more! The climbs were extra spicy and the descents were just as tough. [Despite my concussion and DNF], I still had so much fun and am planning to compete in Ned again next year! Before then, I definitely plan to go back to conquer the Switzerland Trail; it's personal now!" (https://www.distancetoempty.com/news/2022/07/12/ned-gravel-2022-race-report)

**Kate [ELITE]:** "A missed turn led me off course farther than I'd like to admit... While I rode the distance of my race, I wasn't able to finish the [actual] course due to my mistake. I'm proud of the ride with difficult climbs and fast descents even if it was not as the race planners had intended. I learned more about my bike computer, the value of carrying extra equipment to help others, and the kindness and support of the gravel community." (https://www.distancetoempty.com/news/2022/07/12/ned-gravel-2022-race-report)

**Hannah [ELITE]:** "It was hot, hard, and full of ups and downs. While the riding was tough, seeing the D2E ladies and so many other friendly faces was awesome. It makes me feel like I've made my own little space in the gravel community, and there are some pretty rad humans there with me! I'm still learning how to best fuel, stay cool in the summer heat, and push through hard climbs (Nederland hills are no joke) - but I met my goal of finishing under 5 hours and am pretty proud of that." (https://www.distancetoempty.com/news/2022/07/12/ned-gravel-2022-race-report)

**Aimee [ELITE]:** Took third overall in the Ultra distance (107 miles, 12,400' climbing at 8,200-10,500' elevation). Crashed on the Mammoth Gulch descent with a "solid smash to the knee" but "quickly pulled it together, and continued on to podium." (https://www.distancetoempty.com/news/2022/07/12/ned-gravel-2022-race-report)

**Gavin Coombs (Race Director) [UNKNOWN]:** "Ned Gravel is such a great bike race, but it's also so much more than that. We've worked hard to cultivate something that feels genuinely local, genuinely inclusive—and powerful in its ability to give back." (https://www.cyclingwest.com/events/gravel-with-soul-ned-gravel-turns-five-with-high-elevation-style-and-substance/)

**Gavin Coombs [UNKNOWN]:** "Overall the event went great! We definitely walk away from each event learning something to make the next year even better.

**Phillip Robb (Cutaway USA founder) [UNKNOWN]:** "We're excited to work with Ned Gravel as they represent two things we hold dear at Cutaway USA: a desire to explore, and to share that exploration with as many people as possible."

**Megan Hottman (Event sponsor/cyclist-lawyer) [COMPETITIVE]:** "Gravel racing is the most welcoming version of bike racing... unlike other road races that require a significant financial investment and a team, it's the rider's grit and tenacity that determine how well they perform. Gravel is about the journey just as much as it is about the destination. It is more laid back and more welcoming." (https://www.elevationoutdoors.com/go-outside/beat-the-heat-july-31-boulder-county-ned-gravel-newly-envisioned-gravel-cycling-event/)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Minimum Tire Width [OFFICIAL]:** "You will need gravel tires for sure! A minimum tire width would be about 35. But a higher volume tire will make it a lot more comfortable.

**Shoes [OFFICIAL]:** "There's a good chance you will be walking at some point. Road shoes are STRONGLY discouraged." (https://www.nedgravel.com/race-info/)

(https://www.nedgravel.com/)
