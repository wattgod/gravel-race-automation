## TERRAIN & COURSE

**Surface Breakdown**

The Bronze course is described as **50/50 gravel to pavement**[1]. The other courses are not explicitly broken down by surface type in the available results.

**Course Features**

The Gold and higher courses follow similar routing: starting at Guercio Field, heading north on Peak to Peak Highway, climbing for about a mile before turning right onto Ridge Road (which transitions into Cold Springs Road), featuring "punchy uphills and fast descents"[4].

The courses pass through **ghost towns, past mines, and up mountains** at elevations between 8,000-10,300 feet, paying "homage to the hardened miners, dreamers and misfits who came before us"[6].

**Technical Difficulty**

The Bronze course is designed as **beginner terrain for new gravel riders**[1]. The Gold course was redesigned in 2023 with "the most technical sections removed to make it more gravel bike friendly"[4]. Overall, the courses are described as "challenging" but "not built for professionals only"[1].

**Elevation Profile Description**

Detailed elevation profiles are not provided in the search results, though the courses are characterized as having significant sustained climbing at high altitude (8,000-10,300 feet).

## ADDITIONAL NOTES

**Missing Information:**

Your query provided known info (75 miles, 6,000 ft elevation) that does not align with official documentation. The Tungsten course—the longest option—is **70 miles with 8,300' of climbing**, not 75 miles with 6,000 feet.

The search results available are primarily from the official Ned Gravel website and event registration platforms. To compile a more comprehensive research dump covering rider reviews, race reports, Reddit discussions, YouTube coverage, and detailed weather/logistics information, additional targeted searches would be needed. I cannot fabricate this information.
