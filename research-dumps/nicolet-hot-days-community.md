## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

The Nicolet Hot Days route shares terrain with the larger Tour de Nicolet system. Based on reports from riders who've completed related routes in the area:

**Shane Hitz [ELITE]** describes the broader Nicolet terrain on the SoNic 1.2 route (225 miles): "It has two sections of old school singletrack the first being four miles long...It has about 20% roads that are gnarly chunk or unrelenting sand...Some of the roads are tough - from the snowmobile trail grass right off the bat to legendary Nicolet-Roche singletrack known for massive boulders... It's a remote truck road that seems interminable until it's over." (https://www.ironbull.org/fkt-leaderboard)

**Chris Schotz [ELITE]** on the same terrain: "It's an adventure with a few grinds and great rewards. Riding the SoNic in one go is a lot like the infamous Crusher up in Michigan - enhanced gravel with truck road surprises." He notes "the loose rock and washboards" and describes terrain that "keeps changing just like the rest - pavement, sand, rock, narrow, wide, often isolated, never urban." (https://www.ironbull.org/fkt-leaderboard)

**Nick Holzem [ELITE]** on the Aurora Vistas route (365 miles) mentions: "Butler Rock area was tough, loose big rock, and plenty of sand" and describes "steep ATV trails" in the Lakewood area. (https://www.ironbull.org/fkt-leaderboard)

The Wisconsin Bike Fed describes the broader Nicolet area as having "a network of beautiful rolling gravel forest roads, rough two-track and well-maintained mountain bike trails pass by thousands of small lakes and streams." They note "quite a few sections of typical washboard and the gravel is pretty loose and soft" and mention that "There are a few sections of two-track/ATV trail that are rutted with deep puddles." (https://wisconsinbikefed.org/route/tour-de-nicolet/)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Shane Hitz [ELITE]** completed the SoNic 1.2 (225 miles) on "a bone stock Surly Karate Monkey single speed 32/20 gearing with 2.25 tires." (https://www.ironbull.org/fkt-leaderboard)

**Chris Schotz [ELITE]** for his FKT attempt: "I normally run a loaded Fargo with 29x2.6 tires, but for the FKT I rode a stripped down gravel bike with 700x50 tires - the minimum to get it done." He calls 700x50 "the minimum" for this type of Nicolet terrain. (https://www.ironbull.org/fkt-leaderboard)

**Nick Holzem [ELITE]** rode Trek's new Checkout bikepacking bike with full suspension: "What a fantastic way to celebrate the release and enjoy the labors of my work." He notes having "a blast riding down the steep technical chute" at Big Rock on the full suspension setup. (https://www.ironbull.org/fkt-leaderboard)

Wisconsin Bike Fed notes: "While a mountain bike is ideal for these sections, none of them are overly technical, so a gravel bike is fine." They also recommend "a head net and a lightweight long sleeve shirt treated with permethrin that you can wear if the flies are bad, and to avoid ticks when riding through heavy forest." (https://wisconsinbikefed.org/route/tour-de-nicolet/)

## Weather Experienced

**2023 conditions - Shane Hitz [ELITE]:** "The heat was cranking so I did use almost all of the four liters I was carrying on one section" during his June 19-20, 2023 SoNic attempt. He notes "This area hasn't had meaningful rain since the beginning of May so in a normal year the sand would be a bit tamer." (https://www.ironbull.org/fkt-leaderboard)

**2025 conditions - Nick Holzem [ELITE]:** Late September timing "could not have been much better...dry and warm conditions, with elevated temperatures in the 70's and overnights lows in the 40's." (https://www.ironbull.org/fkt-leaderboard)

**2020 conditions [UNKNOWN]:** Wisconsin Bike Fed reports: "It rained before the trip, but only once at night on the trip." They note "Summer wild flowers were popping" and recommend July-August for swimming, though "black flies, mosquitoes and ticks are in abundance during the summer months." (https://wisconsinbikefed.org/route/tour-de-nicolet/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Chris Schotz [ELITE]** on his 19hr 19min FKT (225 miles): "When Shane wanted me to see how fast the SoNic could be done I passed all the good eating and resupplied at two gas stations along the way which was sufficient with two bottles, a hydration pack and ideal weather." (https://www.ironbull.org/fkt-leaderboard)

**Nick Holzem [ELITE]** on his 52hr 25min FKT (365 miles): "I had originally planned to ride it evenly spaced over 3 days; 140, 130, and 90 the last day." He ended up pushing harder: "Night riding was slower than I imagined." After a tough first day ending around 10pm, he notes: "Tuesday I woke up, felt renewed...I put in a nice 160ish mile day, rode til just past midnight under an amazing full moon." (https://www.ironbull.org/fkt-leaderboard)

**Shane Hitz [ELITE]** on hydration for his 23hr 46min effort: "I was running a bit heavy with food and water. The heat was cranking so I did use almost all of the four liters I was carrying on one section but I brought food back." He emphasizes checking the route carefully: "Trust the SoNic gpx route because it will take you to unexpected places." (https://www.ironbull.org/fkt-leaderboard)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Nick Holzem [ELITE]** notes recovery challenges: "Late July I had a major injury where I fractured my calcaneus (heel) while mountain biking in Copper Harbor. The recovery was long and is still ongoing. I was non weight bearing for 3 months post-surgery, had to relearn to walk." This affected his original 2024 attempt plans. (https://www.ironbull.org/fkt-leaderboard)

Wisconsin Bike Fed emphasizes: "Download the route as you will not have cell service for much of the route" and recommends having "Forest Service paper maps of the ranger districts and the state bike map both show all the unimproved roads, much easier to use for detours and short cuts than the small screen on mobile devices." (https://wisconsinbikefed.org/route/tour-de-nicolet/)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

The event emphasizes community and skill-building. Per the organizer: "The event's goal is to build a stronger bikepacking community by learning from each other and to empower riders by doing a few things that may feel intimidating." It's designed "for all levels of bikepackers, veterans and those interested in being introduced to bikepacking with an emphasis on adventure." (https://www.ironbull.org/nicolet-hot-days)

**Shane Hitz [ELITE]** on dispersed camping in the National Forest: "Camping in dispersed spots in the National Forest is always a magical experience when doing stuff like this." (https://www.ironbull.org/fkt-leaderboard)

**Nick Holzem [ELITE]:** "Scored free cheese curds at Johnie's Resort a short while later too. Thought they might serve food, I was wrong, and I was not looking to wait 20 minutes for a frozen pizza. Nice people there!" (https://www.ironbull.org/fkt-leaderboard)

**Chris Schotz [ELITE]** on ATV riders: "On the Nicolet Trail around Lakewood the side-by-side ATVs start to become abundant. Just smile and wave. They're nice enough and always have a cooler. They might offer a beer if you show off or something. It was just a Miller Lite." (https://www.ironbull.org/fkt-leaderboard)

Wisconsin Bike Fed describes the broader Tour de Nicolet group experience: "Shane was nice enough to invite me to tag along with a group of 12 friends, mostly from the Wausau area...It was great to finally go on a ride that someone else organized where all I had to do was pedal and take photos!" (https://wisconsinbikefed.org/route/tour-de-nicolet/)

## Local Food & Resupply Highlights

**White Lake Market:** Shane Hitz [ELITE] calls it having "the best sandwiches anywhere. Had a breakfast sandwich there." Nick Holzem [ELITE] adds: "I settled for an amazing fresh custard filled donut and hot chocolate; the deli was closed that Monday meaning no hot breakfast sandwich unfortunately." (https://www.ironbull.org/fkt-leaderboard)

**Northern Delites in Lakewood:** "a burger and ice cream stand only open in the summer" (Shane Hitz [ELITE]) (https://www.ironbull.org/fkt-leaderboard)

**Waubee Lodge:** "has a great soup and salad bar with a big menu" (Shane Hitz [ELITE]). Nick Holzem [ELITE] notes: "The staff at the Waubee Lodge took our temperatures before we could enter, wore masks and seated our group away from others in the restaurant." (https://www.ironbull.org/fkt-leaderboard)

**Roadhouse 139 in Lakewood:** Wisconsin Bike Fed describes "the smoked ¼ chicken with two delicious homemade sides for $8" and notes "Others said the same of the Mac and Cheese." (https://wisconsinbikefed.org/route/tour-de-nicolet/)

**Thirsty Bear Pub:** "an amazing craft beer selection on tap and homemade pizza" overlooking Long Lake, about 13 miles north of Antigo. (https://wisconsinbikefed.org/route/tour-de-nicolet/)

## Wildlife & Natural Features

**Shane Hitz [ELITE]:** "The wildlife was unforgettable too. Saw a coyote right off the bat. And then riding at night was magical with all of the fireflies." He also encountered a bear: "I saw a fairly good sized bear at dusk on the muddy mile made famous in the Bear 100 gravel race. The bear went away when I told it where to go." (https://www.ironbull.org/fkt-leaderboard)

Wisconsin Bike Fed notes riders "may be lucky enough to see black bears, elk, bald eagles, porcupines and lots of deer." They photographed "two small fawns swimming across the river with their mom" and "a garter snake was sunning on a rock next to my tent for hours."
