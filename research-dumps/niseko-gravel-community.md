I was pleasantly surprised how lucky we got and found such a jagged quiet road without too much effort." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/training-rides/japan-ride-report-panaracer-niseko-gravel-by-kae-takeshita/)

**Kae Takeshita [COMPETITIVE]:** "There was one very long gravel descent in the deep woods. The ground was noticeably soft and greasy at some spots. I was expecting something more twisty and winding, but surprisingly it was fairly straight and really long. What is this road usually used for??" (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/training-rides/japan-ride-report-panaracer-niseko-gravel-by-kae-takeshita/)

(https://www.gravelcyclist.com/training-rides/japan-ride-report-panaracer-niseko-gravel-by-kae-takeshita/)
