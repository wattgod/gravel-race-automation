**Event Description [UNKNOWN]:** "Nordic Chase Gravel is a one-of-a-kind self-supported ultra-distance gravel cycling event connecting Copenhagen to Oslo through the wild and breathtaking terrain of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway. Designed for experienced riders seeking true endurance, this 800 km gravel route offers 7,300 meters of elevation gain and over 60% unpaved surfaces—making it one of the most ambitious gravel events in Northern Europe."

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**From Route Description [UNKNOWN]:** "The route begins in Denmark's vibrant capital, crossing rural landscapes and rolling farmland before a ferry crossing into southern Sweden. Riders then traverse remote gravel paths, serene lakesides, and forested ridgelines deep into the Swedish backcountry. The final section enters Norway's dramatic terrain, culminating at the finish line in Oslo." (https://gravelevents.com/event/nordic-chase-gravel-edition/)

**Surface Composition [UNKNOWN]:** Route described as "+60% gravel" in the Berlin-Copenhagen chapter description, but "over 80% gravel" for the Copenhagen-Oslo edition, suggesting the Oslo route is significantly more off-road. (https://nordicchase.com/cph-osl-gravel)

**Course Character [UNKNOWN]:** "White gravel roads, winding climbs with sea-view, technical descents through pine forests, loose rock sections and flowing high-speed stretches" — this description is from testing gravel bikes in Nice, France, but gives context for the type of terrain modern gravel race bikes need to handle. (https://granfondo-cycling.com/best-race-gravel-bike-review/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Self-Supported Rules [UNKNOWN]:** "This is not a stage race. Nordic Chase Gravel is a single-stage, fixed-route event with a generous 110-hour cutoff time. Riders must be fully self-supported—no outside assistance, no pre-arranged help, and no team cars. Navigation, logistics, and pacing are entirely up to each participant, though group riding and shared effort are permitted under the race rules." (https://gravelevents.com/event/nordic-chase-gravel-edition/)

**Drafting Allowed [UNKNOWN]:** Unlike some ultra-endurance events, "riders are welcome to draft and travel in groups, making it both a personal test and a shared experience." (https://bikepacking.com/event/2026-nordic-chase-gravel/)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Event Philosophy [UNKNOWN]:** "Created for the ultra-distance gravel and bikepacking community, Nordic Chase Gravel combines the grit of unsupported racing with the beauty of Nordic wilderness. It's not just a race; it's a multi-country journey across some of Europe's most pristine and underexplored gravel terrain." (https://gravelevents.com/event/nordic-chase-gravel-edition/)

**Organizer Background [UNKNOWN]:** "The event is independently organized by a passionate ultra-cyclist based in Copenhagen" — Gregory Sanders personally verified the route in summer 2025. (https://nordicchase.com/cph-osl-gravel)
