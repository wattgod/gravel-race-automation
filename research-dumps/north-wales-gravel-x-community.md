# NORTH WALES GRAVEL X — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Jon in Sweden [ELITE]:** "Preparation running up to the race was very good. Volume was high enough, intensity was there, and the bike set up was on point. I ended up going with my Grizl SL6 with SRAM Apex XPLR with 44t front and 10-44 back. Schwalbe Racing Ray/Ralph, front and back, 2.1". [...] I crossed the line in 3hrs 38, for 104km, with an average power of 336w and 370w NP. I finished in 3rd place, with first and second 4-5 minutes ahead. [...] At the 40 minute point, my normalised power was about 420w. [...] I am a very strong climber for my size, and was dropping everyone on the climbs despite not really pushing very hard (I was typically climbing at 100-115% of FTP). [...] In a stroke of tremendous luck, I puctured on the final straight and didn't even notice until I tried to ride up to the race village afterwards and the tyre went completely flat. A big gash in the rear, which I attempted to plug later on but it wouldn't hold air. Having seen literally dozens of guys at the side of the road covered in sealant, I realise that I'm incredibly lucky."

**Jon in Sweden [ELITE]:** "I marshalled on the Saturday, for the womens' races and the mens over 50s. It was cold and windy, but at least it didn't rain. The evening saw enough rain to make the track quite wet, and then race day for me say intermittent showers and 30kph wind. 16-17c. Miserable weather really, but suits me so much better than hot."

**Jon in Sweden [ELITE]:** "There were 86 in my age group (40-44). I got to the pens early and got a front spot. I pushed off fairly hard at the start, but didn't go absolutely all out. The opening 500m is flat along a dam wall, with a tight and punchy little 10% climb at the end of it. That split the group a bit."

**Jon in Sweden [ELITE]:** "By 20km, I'd caught and passed all but a handful in my group and we decided to work together to try to catch the leaders. [...] The issue was that I was the strongest of the five, and I wasn't sure (with this being my first mass start race) whether I should hold back a little to try to keep the group or whether to push on."

**rareposter [UNKNOWN]:** "I did a substantial portion of that loop a few months back in a gravel sportive, the Glorious Gravel North Wales Gravel X. I wasn't hanging around (and I hooked up with a very fast rider inside the last 30km) but there were a few people in the event really pushing it, obviously using it as training for the qualifier. It's a great ride, some properly remote bits."

**Tim o [UNKNOWN]:** "My son rode that race, same age group as you, his first gravel race. Made a schoolboy error of riding around warming up only to find that he was at the back of the pen for the start, so went over the startline pretty well at the back. Missed the fast groups that formed and did a lot of the first half riding solo. Eventually found some others to ride with and later the faster riders from the next age group caught him and he latched on. Came in something like 16th which got a qualification for Maastricht, which was the objective. He loved every minute of it."

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Jon in Sweden [ELITE]:** Used Grizl SL6 with SRAM Apex XPLR, 44t front and 10-44 back cassette. Ran Schwalbe Racing Ray/Ralph 2.1" front and back. Notes: "The descents on the other side were almost designed for me with them being not too steep, but fairly twisty, with technical cornering and rough terrain. I ride 1500km plus gravel per month, so I'm really comfortable on loose terrain, and the 2.1" tyres gave me a lot of grip."
(https://forum.cyclinguk.org/viewtopic.php?t=166324)

**Official Event Recommendation [ORGANIZER]:** "A standard all-rounder gravel tyre (35-45mm) will be ideal for both routes. [...] This route is designed for gravel bikes but you will be fine on a hardtail MTB."
(https://gloriousgravel.com/product/gravel-sportives/north-wales-gravel-x)

**Official Packing List [ORGANIZER]:** Recommends carrying: 2x inner tubes, tubeless repair kit with plugs and spare sealant, multitool, chain link, small pump, brake pads (especially in wet conditions), crepe roll bandage, gauze dressing, assorted plasters, antiseptic.

## Weather Experienced

**Jon in Sweden [ELITE] - Race Day 2025:** "It was cold and windy, but at least it didn't rain. The evening saw enough rain to make the track quite wet, and then race day for me saw intermittent showers and 30kph wind. 16-17c. Miserable weather really, but suits me so much better than hot."

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Jon in Sweden [ELITE]:** "The opening 500m is flat along a dam wall, with a tight and punchy little 10% climb at the end of it. That split the group a bit. The course goes around a reservoir initially, with some climbs to split the field."

**Official Route Description [ORGANIZER]:** "The gravel in this part of North Wales is mostly smooth with a couple of soft spots which could be muddy if wet but overall this is an off-roader suitable for all abilities. [...] 90% of route is off-road."
(https://gloriousgravel.com/product/gravel-sportives/north-wales-gravel-x)

**Official Route Description [ORGANIZER]:** "Starting with a lap of the world famous karting track at GYG, we head around the beautiful and wild Llyn Alwen before a lap of Llyn Brenig. From there, we head into Clocaenog Forest for some punchy climbs and beautiful fire roads."
(https://gloriousgravel.com/product/gravel-sportives/north-wales-gravel-x)

**Official Route Description [ORGANIZER]:** "Both routes involve a decent amount of climbing starting with a tough climb to Alwen. The forest section is lumpy but the sections around the reservoirs is flatter and flowing."

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Jon in Sweden [ELITE] - 3rd Place, 40-44 Age Group:** "I pushed off fairly hard at the start, but didn't go absolutely all out. [...] At the 40 minute point, my normalised power was about 420w. [...] I was typically climbing at 100-115% of FTP. [...] By the end of the first lap (52km), the group has gone and I did the second lap solo. I caught 4 or 5 more of my age group over the course of the lap, despite having throttled back a bit. I had it in my head to save something for the final half hour."

**Power/Pacing Data [ELITE]:** Finished 104km in 3:38 with average power 336w and normalized power 370w. This is elite-level output and not applicable to recreational riders.

**Jon in Sweden [ELITE] - Race Strategy Reflection:** "The issue was that I was the strongest of the five, and I wasn't sure (with this being my first mass start race) whether I should hold back a little to try to keep the group or whether to push on. [...] The descents [...] I descended generally on gravity, giving myself a little rest and the others a chance to catch so we could work together on the flats. With hindsight, there weren't really enough flats to warrant this."

**Tim o [UNKNOWN] - Start Line Advice:** "Made a schoolboy error of riding around warming up only to find that he was at the back of the pen for the start, so went over the startline pretty well at the back. Missed the fast groups that formed and did a lot of the first half riding solo."

## DNF Risk Factors

**Jon in Sweden [ELITE]:** "For the last 25km, I had (for the first time in my life) some pretty unpleasant cramps. [...] Having seen literally dozens of guys at the side of the road covered in sealant, I realise that I'm incredibly lucky." Indicates punctures/flats were common on race day.

**Jon in Sweden [ELITE]:** "In a stroke of tremendous luck, I puctured on the final straight and didn't even notice until I tried to ride up to the race village afterwards and the tyre went completely flat. A big gash in the rear, which I attempted to plug later on but it wouldn't hold air."
