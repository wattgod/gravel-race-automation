**BICI ITALIA staff [UNKNOWN]:** "Last Saturday we participated in Tuscany's Nova Eroica Gravel Race... We managed to make the initial front group of 20 or so which formed in the first km and spent that first hour before the first actual timed gravel sector of Monte Sante Marie with the lead group. We simply rode at our own pace towards the front of the pack. Enjoying the food stops and scenery, we rode tempo until the finish. It was a really fun day on the bike and we were happy to finish the long route with the top cyclists. Definitely a Class A event added to the memory book."
