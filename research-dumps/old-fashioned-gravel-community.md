**Ian Breitlow [UNKNOWN]:** "Amazing! I have done so many grassroots events in the Midwest and this was I think #1 for quality and hospitality.

**Ryan Greene [UNKNOWN]:** "I raced all over this year everything from Midsouth to Montana to Steamboat this race packed the biggest punch with the most gravel as far as course goes. The people were great, volunteers awesome, the only thing lacking was some organization and that big finish line feel that you get at some of these other races.

(https://www.raceentry.com/old-fashioned-gravel/race-reviews)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Mechanical Issues at Mile 40:** At least one rider (Uriah Matznick) reported a mechanical DNF around mile 40 of the 100-mile course. (https://www.raceentry.com/old-fashioned-gravel/race-reviews)

**Navigation Issues:** Course maps were described as "a bit wonky" by one rider. Another rider got lost on the shake-out ride due to wrong directions on the cue sheet. (https://www.raceentry.com/old-fashioned-gravel/race-reviews)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Venue:** The race starts and finishes at a rustic farm in Hokah, Minnesota, owned by friends of the race director. The barn serves as the event center. The property is working with the State of Minnesota to develop a sustainability plan, and a portion of race proceeds support this project. (https://www.thenxrth.com/post/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-new-old-fashioned-gravel-race-this-october)

**Amenities:** Hot coffee and pastries in the morning. Clean, non-porta-potty bathrooms. Camping available in the pasture (riders could sleep in cars on-site, helpful due to high hotel prices). (https://www.raceentry.com/old-fashioned-gravel/race-reviews)

**Post-Race:** Food, drink, awards, raffle, and prizes. Described as having a "farm field pre and post race" gathering atmosphere. (https://www.raceentry.com/old-fashioned-gravel/race-reviews)

**Local Support:** The event uses local businesses for food and hydration. Hokah is described as "a super cool little town." (https://www.oldfashionedgravel.com/)

**Race Director Philosophy:** Paul Reardon, race director and owner of Blue Steel Bike (custom titanium and steel frame builder), emphasizes the grassroots nature: "if you want to race, we will be timing, and we wish you luck. If you want to come challenge yourself, or just go for a ride with other rad people, make new friends, eat, drink, and laugh, that's what it is all about!" (https://www.thenxrth.com/post/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-new-old-fashioned-gravel-race-this-october)

**Event Quality:** Multiple riders compared it favorably to major gravel events. One rider ranked it "#1 for quality and hospitality" among Midwest grassroots events. Another said it "packed the biggest punch with the most gravel" compared to Midsouth, Montana, and Steamboat races. (https://www.raceentry.com/old-fashioned-gravel/race-reviews)

**Name Origin:** The "Old Fashioned" name has dual meanings: a nod to Wisconsin/Minnesota supper club culture (meeting with friends and family, enjoying beverages) and a tribute to the grassroots, old-school gravel riding community.
