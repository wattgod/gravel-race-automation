# OREGON COAST GRAVEL EPIC — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Mielle Blomberg [UNKNOWN]:** "Our riders meeting announcements led me to believe my race route could include the following: becoming a human kite in monster cross-winds, sinking in a gravel slurry mix of wheel sucking quicksand, getting t-boned by a nice retiree backing out of their driveway, or ending my day and possibly my front wheel in any number of kiddie pool sized potholes of unknown depth on a sun-blind downhill." (https://blog.sellwoodcycle.com/race-report-oregon-coast-gravel-epic/)

**Mielle Blomberg [UNKNOWN]:** "1st hill, immediately after go, was about a 30% grade punch and a chain breaker for the guy next to me who made it 2 pedal strokes before it snapped... I counted 6 riders with flats pulled off on the side of the road in the first 5 miles and we hadn't even got to the slurry of no return yet." (https://blog.sellwoodcycle.com/race-report-oregon-coast-gravel-epic/)

**Mielle Blomberg [UNKNOWN]:** "The descent after Aide Station 1 (mile 13.6) was rough, thick gravel with tight sweeping corners and little room for error. We were warned of a very sharp left turn towards the bottom and I barely pulled off the gas when I arrived and ended up in the weeds to avoid leaving all of my skin behind in a gravel washout." (https://blog.sellwoodcycle.com/race-report-oregon-coast-gravel-epic/)

**Mielle Blomberg [UNKNOWN]:** "Rain continued for over 4 hours as we humped our way through the coast range... The last climb is almost 10 miles. That is all I am worried about. What a doozie... Up, with more ups, out of the saddle ups, low back screaming ups. Oh look. More ups! Ughhh." (https://blog.sellwoodcycle.com/race-report-oregon-coast-gravel-epic/)

**Mielle Blomberg [UNKNOWN]:** "After a righthand turn the sun was indeed glaring through the haze of our passing storm and the 'fire swamp' presented itself. Huge holes, some obvious, some not, requiring some fast thinking at 20+mph as they spread across the road like landmines." (https://blog.sellwoodcycle.com/race-report-oregon-coast-gravel-epic/)

**Shawn Petersen [ELITE - 4th AG/50-59, 18th OA]:** "Day 1: I came into this one carrying a little race anxiety and the memory that this course is hard for me with 4 climbs and a lot of time in the red... Final climb: I was with three other riders, then dropped them all. Thought I might be fighting for a podium. Then cramps hit hard with 1 miles to go." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/shawns-story-oregon-coast-gravel-epic)

**Shawn Petersen [ELITE]:** "Day 2: Race started on up hill with nearly an hour of fast uphill racing. I stayed with the main group (non-elite) for most of the first climb, then ended up in a small group. Dropped everyone near the top... Climb two was a grind. Dropped, clawed back on thanks to a solo rider, then lost the group again right at the top." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/shawns-story-oregon-coast-gravel-epic)

**Alex Turpin (training for race) [UNKNOWN]:** "I love riding the back roads of Lincoln County. It's picturesque, unexplored. There are hardly any cars to mess with... It's a different kind of bike race. It's a great adventure ride, it's well-supported, and it's definitely the one I want to do!" (https://traveloregon.com/things-to-do/outdoor-recreation/bicycling/the-oregon-coast-gravel-epic/)

**Steve Cash, Race Organizer [UNKNOWN]:** "This is either a great ride or an abomination... is remote, it's hilly and it's an ass-kicker. It's also a gorgeous ride through deep forest and along ridges with vistas of seemingly endless trees to the east and the sparkle of the ocean to the west." (https://traveloregon.com/things-to-do/outdoor-recreation/bicycling/the-oregon-coast-gravel-epic/)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Mielle Blomberg [UNKNOWN]:** Used 700x35c file tread tires on the Abomination route with aggressive gravel and rocky roads. "My 700x35c file tread tires have served me really well for rides like these, with aggressive gravel and rocky roads, so I was hoping I wouldn't be number 7" (referring to seeing 6 flats in first 5 miles). (https://blog.sellwoodcycle.com/race-report-oregon-coast-gravel-epic/)

**Mielle Blomberg [UNKNOWN]:** Rode with a "Corn Cob" cassette (fewer gears for steep climbs) on cyclocross/gravel bike. Notes this made climbs harder: "That means I roll with less gears for steep climbs and more reason for whining about it." (https://blog.sellwoodcycle.com/race-report-oregon-coast-gravel-epic/)

**Mielle Blomberg [UNKNOWN]:** Weather gear was critical: "With temps around 52F, the rain made me thankful I kept a rain jacket on and warm leggings." (https://blog.sellwoodcycle.com/race-report-oregon-coast-gravel-epic/)

**Shawn Petersen [ELITE]:** "Tires were too small for the dry sketchy descents" (Day 1). "Need bigger tires—descents were loose and sketchy" (Day 2 takeaway). (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/shawns-story-oregon-coast-gravel-epic)

**Official Course Info [UNKNOWN]:** "38MM Tires Minimum recommended but not required. Know your ability to break!... Some areas are smooth but have moss and pine needles and some pothole" (https://www.mudslingerevents.com/oregon-coast-gravel-epic)

**Alex Turpin (training) [UNKNOWN]:** Used Co-Motion Velo-Raptor with "X'Plor MSO" tires for training. (https://traveloregon.com/things-to-do/outdoor-recreation/bicycling/the-oregon-coast-gravel-epic/)

## Weather Experienced

**2017 Event - Mielle Blomberg:** Started at 52°F with 15-20 mph head/cross winds in first 4 miles. Rain arrived 30 minutes in and "continued for over 4 hours."

**2024 Event:** Described as "Rainfall of biblical proportions" with "Well over 2.1 inches of rain in two days." Article notes: "In fact, they've have had colder events or more rain, at Mudslinger 2018, but this took the cake and some souls too!" One rider notes "Today I completed the short course... It was fun even though it was cold and very rainy." (https://www.granfondoguide.com/RaceDashboard/OregonTripleCrownSeries/1/7958/rainfall-of-biblical-proportions-slams-into-oregon-coast-gravel-epic and https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/1ckfa4n/a_very_rainy_race_in_oregon/)

**Historical Weather Pattern:** Official info states "70% of the time it has been dry to a slight drizzle with temperatures 55-60 at the start." Also warns: "During the week it may rain, so be prepared!" and "when the course is wet, the moss and center of all paved sections can be slick but manageable." (https://www.mudslingerevents.com/oregon-coast-gravel-epic)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Opening Climb:** "1st hill, immediately after go, was about a 30% grade punch" (Mielle Blomberg). (https://blog.sellwoodcycle.com/race-report-oregon-coast-gravel-epic/)

**Early Section (Miles 0-5):** Flat paved Crestline Dr. at top of first hill with 15-20 mph headwinds for 4 miles, then onto dual track gravel roads. "6 riders with flats pulled off on the side of the road in the first 5 miles." Mix of "dual track mud and gravel with tons of debris from the hard winter." (https://blog.sellwoodcycle.com/race-report-oregon-coast-gravel-epic/)

**Aid Station 1 Area (Mile 13.6):** "The descent after Aide Station 1 was rough, thick gravel with tight sweeping corners and little room for error. We were warned of a very sharp left turn towards the bottom." (https://blog.sellwoodcycle.com/race-report-oregon-coast-gravel-epic/)

**Miles 30-40:** "One of the most beautiful parts of this route happen between mile 30 and 40 when the swollen Yachts River appears on your left, blending the sound of rushing water with spinning wet tires on pavement, leading you to open farm lands and a dilapidated barn making its' last stand." (https://blog.sellwoodcycle.com/race-report-oregon-coast-gravel-epic/)

**Aid Station 2/Course Split (Mile 14/44):** This is where routes split - long course left, short course right. At mile 44 for long course: "I am warned at the last Aide Station of 'slick conditions' on the descent." (https://blog.sellwoodcycle.com/race-report-oregon-coast-gravel-epic/)

**Final Climb:** "The last climb is almost 10 miles... Up, with more ups, out of the saddle ups, low back screaming ups." Followed by a "very rough descent. It was indeed slick and the corners were tricky to avoid sliding in the mud or washing out in fresh gravel." (https://blog.sellwoodcycle.com/race-report-oregon-coast-gravel-epic/)

**Final Descent:** "After a righthand turn the sun was indeed glaring through the haze... Huge holes, some obvious, some not, requiring some fast thinking at 20+mph as they spread across the road like landmines." (https://blog.sellwoodcycle.com/race-report-oregon-coast-gravel-epic/)

**Finish:** "The finish of this day is actually UPHILL. 1/4 mile of almost single track, mud and rocks until the overgrown shrubs recede to the glorious finish line tent." (https://blog.sellwoodcycle.com/race-report-oregon-coast-gravel-epic/)

**Course Composition:** Official description states "65% unpaved logging roads... and 35% smooth pavement." Gravel is "3/4" and larger for 65% of the course." (https://www.mudslingerevents.com/oregon-coast-gravel-epic)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Shawn Petersen [ELITE - 3:51 finish Day 1, 3:08 finish Day 2]:** Day 1 strategy issues: "Got caught off guard at the start—guy elbowed past me in the rollout, forgot to start my Wahoo until the end of the first climb... Got dropped on the second climb and ended up in a small chase group where I probably did more work than I should've... Fueling felt late. Hydration might've been off." Day 2 improvements: "Fueling was on point: 2 bottles w/ 80g carbs, 5 gels + 1 caffeine gel, 1 pack Clif Bloks. Caffeine gel late in the day was a game-changer." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/shawns-story-oregon-coast-gravel-epic)

**Mielle Blomberg [UNKNOWN - 12 minutes ahead of goal time]:** Successfully managed pace to finish ahead of goal despite challenging conditions.

## DNF Risk Factors

**Early Mechanicals:** One rider's chain snapped after just 2 pedal strokes on opening 30% grade climb. "6 riders with flats pulled off on the side of the road in the first 5 miles" before reaching the worst gravel sections. (https://blog.sellwoodcycle.com/race-report-oregon-coast-gravel-epic/)

**Cramping:** Shawn Petersen [ELITE]: "Then cramps hit hard with 1 miles to go" after thinking he was in podium position. Notes "Hydration might've been off." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/shawns-story-oregon-coast-gravel-epic)

**Weather-Related Drops:** 2024 event with 2.1" rain in two days: riders described getting "cold and motivated to finish or get a ride at the second aid station" when unprepared for rain. Despite this, "Lots of big smiles for miles despite challenging conditions." (https://www.granfondoguide.com/RaceDashboard/OregonTripleCrownSeries/1/7958/rainfall-of-biblical-proportions-slams-into-oregon-coast-gravel-epic)

**Course Splitting Decision:** "Please remember you may drop down to the shorter 37-mile loop during the event at Aid Alpha by stopping and notifying the aid station people."
