# OREGON TRAIL GRAVEL GRINDER — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Flo Costa [ELITE]:** "The Oregon Trail Gravel Grinder was one of my target races for the year. Leading up to the race I was able to put in a solid block of specific training, followed by a taper week that left me feeling pretty good on race day." On Stage 1 flatting: "I felt helpless as a handful of rides passed by, but had 'only' lost 3 minutes on this 4+ hour day." After a second flat near the top of the final climb: "I was too frustrated to try to make up any time and descended gingerly to the finish. I finished in 22nd, 40 minutes behind 7th, upset and exhausted." On Stage 2: "I woke up the next morning in my tent with my legs more sore than they'd ever been after a race." (https://www.altovelo.org/blog/race-report-oregon-trail-gravel-grinder)

**Sofia Gomez-Villafañe [ELITE]:** "I think the vibes are so high that people forget how hard this race actually is. I got cooked in 2022… and I never came back for the entire rest of the year." On choosing accommodations: "I was a little anti-spirit on that one, but I also know that this race takes a lot out of you. And I have too much respect for this race. And I just had to do what was going to set me up the best not only for the week, but for the coming weeks after." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/oregon-trail-gravel-grinder-2025-results-race-report/)

**Cameron Jones [ELITE]:** "It's an amazing experience as always. There's a reason I came back and it's the first race I put on my calendar for this year." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/oregon-trail-gravel-grinder-2025-results-race-report/)

**Sarah Sturm [ELITE]:** "You learn so much [in stage racing]. You get so much fitness, the GC can change with one flat tire. It's super exciting. There's tactics." And: "It's honestly some of the hardest racing, but I really love this race so much. I always come away with it with new friends, new connections, and a new appreciation for what my body can do. It's just a really special week, even though it's brutal." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/oregon-trail-gravel-grinder-2025-results-race-report/)

**Payson McElveen [ELITE]:** "I've just had this on my bucket list for ages. I'm in for future years too, because it was just awesome. Everyone has always told me how awesome it is, but it was even better than I expected." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/oregon-trail-gravel-grinder-2025-results-race-report/)

**Desiree Taylor [RECREATIONAL]:** "We saw that [Oregon Trail] is an all-inclusive [experience], like going to Cancun, except to ride your bike. People at work were like, 'So you're going to ride your bike?' And I'm like, yeah. 'You're not going to sit on the beach?' No—we're going to ride bikes." (https://www.oregontrailgravelgrinder.com/dispatches)

**Catie George [RECREATIONAL]:** (First-time gravel racer) "Today was really good. Meeting all the other racers was super cool. And I'm looking forward to improving over the next few days as I get more comfortable on the bike and on the terrain." (https://www.oregontrailgravelgrinder.com/dispatches)

**Cécile Lejeune [ELITE]:** "After a cold night, where I wake up a first time to retrieve an extra layer from my tote box, and a second time to rook around for some food to sooth my hungry stomach, I pile my plate with bagels and muffins. The name of the game this week is carbs, and I know how to play." On fellow competitor: "This is one of many examples of why I love this race, despite being my rival for 5 hours a day on the bike, Michaela is one of the nicest people you will meet and does heartwarming things like this. Hanging out at camp will bring this out of you." (https://cecilelejeune.substack.com/p/oregon-trail-gravel-grinder-the-race)

**Cory Wallace [ELITE]:** "The Oregon Trail Gravel Grinder is always a highlight of any race season. 5 days of proper gravel racing and camping across the Cascades." On recovering from illness: "Unfortunately, I came in with a stomach bug in the first 2 stages, struggling to finish, soon finding myself 2nd to last in GC. Thankfully, things came around on stage 3." On camp: "Camp life was awesome as always, with the 2 nights at Oakridge being the highlight, complete with a refreshing river to swim in after the days of racing." (https://www.konaworld.com/blogs/cog/cory-wallace-reports-on-the-oregon-trail-gravel-grinder)

**Michael van den Ham [ELITE]:** "It's no secret that gravel racing has become pretty serious business these days. In the big, one day races, people have their routines, plans, things that they need to stick to to do well and, well, you don't actually get to spend a lot of time just hanging out. That's very different at Oregon Trail. It's not that the racing isn't serious, it's just that when it ends, you are all in the same place with hours to spare before the next day. A perfect place to just hang out with fellow bike people and make some new friends." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/oregon-trail-gravel-grinder-all-you-need-to-know-about-life-on-the-trail/)

**Ian Boswell [ELITE]:** "The race passes a lot of areas I camped as a kid so I am most looking forward to returning to those areas and also having my daughters and wife along for a few days to relive the memories I have from my childhood." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/oregon-trail-gravel-grinder-all-you-need-to-know-about-life-on-the-trail/)

**Becca Fahringer [ELITE]:** "Multiple stages means you can target racing hard for the overall, or focus on one day. And if you have a bad day on the bike the camp vibes make up for it. It's just fun no matter what!" (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/oregon-trail-gravel-grinder-all-you-need-to-know-about-life-on-the-trail/)

**Sarah Max [ELITE]:** "The racing is hard, and interesting, and challenging, but the whole experience is next level." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/oregon-trail-gravel-grinder-all-you-need-to-know-about-life-on-the-trail/)

**Danni Shrosbree [ELITE]:** "I am racing Oregon Trail as not only is it in an incredible part of America I've always wanted to explore, but also the uniqueness of the event. Racing five hard stages then finishing each day camping in a new spot will be really special." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/oregon-trail-gravel-grinder-all-you-need-to-know-about-life-on-the-trail/)

**Pete Stetina [ELITE]:** "Many of the folks in gravel want to travel for adventure, not just a race result. This is one of the best events to experience one of the USA's nicest mountain ranges." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/oregon-trail-gravel-grinder-all-you-need-to-know-about-life-on-the-trail/)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Cassius Anderson [ELITE]:** ENVE SES 4.5 wheels, Schwalbe RX Pro front / Schwalbe RS Pro rear, SRAM RED and XX1 mullet drivetrain, ENVE one-piece barstem + seatpost, CeramicSpeed OSPW + BB. "Built for high-speed efficiency and stability in unpredictable terrain...perfect for those long accelerations through deep moondust that would swallow lesser bikes whole." (https://argonautcycles.com/inside-the-argonaut-factory-racing-setup-at-oregon-trail/)

**Matthew Wiebe [ELITE]:** Duke Racing Wheels, Schwalbe RX Pro front and rear, SRAM RED XPLR 13-speed with UDH. "The SRAM 13-speed drivetrain gave him the range to tackle steep, rutted climbs with surgical precision, with plenty of cushion for bombing descents at mach 5." (https://argonautcycles.com/inside-the-argonaut-factory-racing-setup-at-oregon-trail/)

**Cassia Boglio [ELITE]:** Argonaut D33 wheels with Carbon-Ti hubs, Pirelli Cinturato M front / Pirelli Cinturato RC rear, SRAM RED XPLR 13-speed. "Cassia's GR3 was the lightest of the three, focused on pure responsiveness and explosive acceleration in the women's elite field." (https://argonautcycles.com/inside-the-argonaut-factory-racing-setup-at-oregon-trail/)

**Flo Costa [ELITE] - Tire Failure:** On Stage 1: "A few minutes into the descent my heart sank as I felt my rear wheel going flat. I prayed for it to seal as I continued following the rider in 7th place ahead of me, but by the time we reached the bottom of the descent, it was completely flat. I suspected it had gotten sliced by the sharp lava rock on the technical descent." Then on the same stage: "I was ready to bomb the descent, which started out pretty techy. Approximately a minute down I had gained a lot of speed and opted for a rocky (but faster) line. I lost a bit of control and hit my front wheel pretty hard on the final big rock. A few seconds later it was completely flat." (https://www.altovelo.org/blog/race-report-oregon-trail-gravel-grinder)

**toolsped [UNKNOWN] - Tire Problem on Lava Rock:** "I've had Kenda Alluvium Pros and Terra Speeds (both 40s) and they both are punctured and only hold air for a day after a ride or two there. Looking for recommendations on something more puncture resistant and coming to maybe pathfinder pros or gravel king sk+." Asking about tire recommendations for the OTGG terrain specifically due to lava rock punctures. (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/1425rwc/oregon_trail_gravel_grinder_tire_question/)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Stage 1 Description [ELITE]:** "The beginning of stage 1 started out relatively flat, with no one wanting to drive the pace up front, on smooth red lava rock gravel roads." Then: "On top of the climb, we turned onto the old Santiam Wagon Road, which turned out to be the 6 sandiest miles of the entire week. I felt pretty comfortable on this section despite my bike squirreling underneath me, but this required many repeated spikes of power. The sandy old Santiam Wagon Road ended with a rocky and tricky descent, which also ended up being the most technical part of the entire week, followed by a smooth, speedy descent on champagne gravel." (https://www.altovelo.org/blog/race-report-oregon-trail-gravel-grinder)

**Stage 1 2025 [RECREATIONAL]:** "Despite the sandy and sometimes loose volcanic rock typical of the eastern Cascades, riders were rewarded with fast-moving roads and expansive views. Much of the course was shaded by towering pine forests, but as the day progressed and riders neared Gilchrist, the landscape began to open up." Day 1 described as "often considered the most tame of the five stages—but it's no walk in the park." (https://www.oregontrailgravelgrinder.com/dispatches)

**Stage 1 2025 Dust Conditions [ELITE]:** "Loose, dry, unpredictable moondust blanketed the roads like talcum powder, reducing visibility to mere feet ahead. You couldn't see the rider in front of you until you were practically kissing their rear wheel. The race detonated from the gun." Described as "riding a bucking bronco through a sandstorm at a rave, surrounded by 250 of your closest friends." (https://argonautcycles.com/inside-the-argonaut-factory-racing-setup-at-oregon-trail/)

**Stage 2 Terrain [ELITE]:** "Throughout the first hour of gravel roads, the size of the group stays steady, except for loosing Morgan for a brief moment due to a flat tire. Going up the first big climb of the day, our pack dwindles down to 5. We progress through giants puddles, chunky climbs and loose-over-hard descents this way for another hour. We hit the steepest and techiest 1km climb of the day...Once we crest, an equally as steep and chunky descent awaits us." Then "the top of the 20 mile gravel descent." (https://cecilelejeune.substack.com/p/oregon-trail-gravel-grinder-the-race)

**Stage 3 TT Format [ELITE]:** "I love this format of racing: three timed sections on a course, 6 miles uphill, 6 miles 'rollercoaster', and 4 miles descent." On the downhill: "It's a steep downhill with many tight turns, loose corners, narrow two-way tracks and low visibility. Not the kind of terrain I excel in." (https://cecilelejeune.substack.com/p/oregon-trail-gravel-grinder-the-race)

**Stage 5 [ELITE]:** "Stage 5 started with a big climb over McKenzie Pass on some pavement before dropping into the dusty east side of the Cascades on some loose gravel roads." With "3 snow piles to run across" for the KOM crown. (https://www.konaworld.com/blogs/cog/cory-wallace-reports-on-the-oregon-trail-gravel-grinder)

**Lava Rock Hazard:** Sharp lava rock is specifically mentioned as a puncture risk and terrain feature throughout multiple elite rider reports. (https://www.altovelo.org/blog/race-report-oregon-trail-gravel-grinder, https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/1425rwc/oregon_trail_gravel_grinder_tire_question/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Flo Costa [ELITE] - Negative Split Strategy on Stage 3:** "Knowing that the second half of the climb was the steepest, I planned for a negative split meaning I would conservatively pace myself for the first half. This also meant that I had to drop myself from the group earlier than I would've liked and had to be strict about maintaining a pace I knew I could hold for 45 minutes. As the climb got steeper, I slowly increased my power and saw that I was catching back up to riders that had started out too hot. With 15 minutes left in the climb, I had been able to pass a few riders and was still feeling pretty good." Set a 45-minute power PR with this approach. (https://www.altovelo.org/blog/race-report-oregon-trail-gravel-grinder)

**Flo Costa [ELITE] - Power PRs:** Set 1-hour power PR on Stage 2 first climb, then beat it again on Stage 4. (https://www.altovelo.org/blog/race-report-oregon-trail-gravel-grinder)

**Flo Costa [ELITE] - Over-Pacing Warning:** "I woke up the next morning in my tent with my legs more sore than they'd ever been after a race. I had been over-eager the day before which led to poor decisions and bad luck. I had to be more patient and race my own race in order to make time up on the riders ahead of me in GC." After Stage 2: "About halfway up, I was pretty close to my limit so I had to ease up in order to have any hope of surviving the stage." Then: "As I started going up, my legs felt empty and I immediately knew it was going to be a long day. I struggled to push power and had run out of energy after only the first climb." (https://www.altovelo.org/blog/race-report-oregon-trail-gravel-grinder)

**Cécile Lejeune [ELITE] - Carb Focus:** "The name of the game this week is carbs, and I know how to play." After waking up starving at 5am before Stage 4: "I force-feed myself breakfast, swallow down the tepid coffee, pack up tent and tote, and start focusing on the day to come." (https://cecilelejeune.substack.com/p/oregon-trail-gravel-grinder-the-race)

**Race Director on 2024 Course Change:** "Changing the course route, the main purpose was to keep it fresh. But also change the dynamics so that it's a more exciting race for anybody following along. And also for the racers themselves – giving more opportunities for people who are not super strong climbers for a chance of a stage win or a chance in the GC." 2024 had less overall climbing than previous years, with Stage 1 being "one of the flatter stages we've ever had." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/oregon-trail-gravel-grinder-all-you-need-to-know-about-life-on-the-trail/)

**Cory Wallace [ELITE] - Attack Timing:** "Stage 5...We had a nice lead group of 8, which I decided to attack with 60 km to go. Going on a solo break, I found myself off the front for nearly 2 hours." (https://www.konaworld.com/blogs/cog/cory-wallace-reports-on-the-oregon-trail-gravel-grinder)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Flat Tires on Lava Rock:** Multiple elite riders reported punctures from sharp lava rock, including double flats in a single stage costing significant time. Flo Costa lost approximately 40 minutes to 7th place on Stage 1 due to two flats. (https://www.altovelo.org/blog/race-report-oregon-trail-gravel-grinder)

**Mechanical Issues:** Matt Wiebe experienced "a rear derailleur issue...just as the field fractured on the final descent" followed by "a 30-mile solo grind into a punishing headwind" on Stage 1. (https://argonautcycles.com/inside-the-argonaut-factory-racing-setup-at-oregon-trail/)

**Crashes:** Cassia Boglio crashed on Stage 1 when "Following a move from none other than Sofia Gomez Villafañe, she hit a perfect storm: a low-hanging branch, a tangle of ruts, and a split-second decision that ended in a high-speed crash. The camp thought she'd broken her arm." This ended her GC contention. (https://argonautcycles.com/inside-the-argonaut-factory-racing-setup-at-oregon-trail/)

**Illness:** Cory Wallace: "Unfortunately, I came in with a stomach bug in the first 2 stages, struggling to finish, soon finding myself 2nd to last in GC." (https://www.konaworld.com/blogs/cog/cory-wallace-reports-on-the-oregon-trail-gravel-grinder)

**Sleep Deprivation:** Cécile Lejeune: "After a short 4h night, I feel more than apprehensive going into the biggest and scariest day of the week. The evening before, I was tossing and turning, going over the day's events, reliving conversations, thinking ahead to the last two days...All of these thoughts were keeping me from sleeping. I also woke up at 5am starving." (https://cecilelejeune.substack.com/p/oregon-trail-gravel-grinder-the-race)

**Cumulative Fatigue:** Sarah Sturm noted: "the GC can change with one flat tire" emphasizing how tight margins are. Sofia Gomez-Villafañe warned: "I got cooked in 2022… and I never came back for the entire rest of the year." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/oregon-trail-gravel-grinder-2025-results-race-report/)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Camp Life:** Race director Chad Sperry: "The team at Breakaway Promotions aims to create an all-inclusive experience where athletes (and their friends or families) are treated to gourmet dining, artisan coffee, and a new campsite every night. It's more than just a race, it's an experience for the whole family." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/oregon-trail-gravel-grinder-all-you-need-to-know-about-life-on-the-trail/)

**Camp Amenities:** "Delicious Catered Breakfast, Lunch, & Dinner. Nightly Campsite Festivities. Post-Ride Massages (additional fee). Stocked Aid Stations. Fat Tire Celebration & Whiskey Bar. On-Course & In-Camp Mechanics. Specialty Morning Coffee." (https://www.oregontrailgravelgrinder.com/)

**Stage 3 Camp at Oakridge [ELITE]:** "The shorter stage was also by far the most productive off the bike - I had extra time to sleep, eat, stretch, wash my bike, and jump in the river at camp. The camp vibes on this day were great; we had plenty of down time to hang out with other athletes and were even treated to a beautiful Oregon sunset." (https://www.altovelo.org/blog/race-report-oregon-trail-gravel-grinder)

**River Swimming:** Multiple riders mentioned swimming in rivers as post-stage recovery. "Complete with a refreshing river to swim in after the days of racing." (https://www.konaworld.com/blogs/cog/cory-wallace-reports-on-the-oregon-trail-gravel-grinder)

**Pro/Amateur Integration:** "By night, they shared war stories over glass-bottle Cokes and catered meals that tasted like victory, regardless of where they'd finished." And: "From anxious strangers sizing each other up at the start line to belly-laughing friends beside the McKenzie River, this event delivers more than results—it offers transformation." (https://argonautcycles.com/inside-the-argonaut-factory-racing-setup-at-oregon-trail/)

**Summer Camp Comparison:** "By day, pros and amateurs battled for position across moondusty climbs and technical descents. By night, they shared war stories over glass-bottle Cokes and catered meals...It's like summer camp for adults who love bikes, dirt, and the kind of suffering that makes you feel truly alive." (https://argonautcycles.com/inside-the-argonaut-factory-racing-setup-at-oregon-trail/)

**Start Line Atmosphere [RECREATIONAL]:** "As the sun moved high in the summer sky above the starting arch at Seventh Mountain Resort, the excitement was palpable. Nervous laughter filled the air as last-minute tire pressure checks were made and jersey pockets were stuffed with gels. Around the start line, hugs and high-fives were exchanged as riders reunited with old friends and made new ones. For many, this was more than a race start—it was a reunion and a celebration of the gravel community." (https://www.oregontrailgravelgrinder.com/dispatches)

**Accommodation Choices:** Some pros camp in tents (Cameron Jones), others rent RVs (Sarah Sturm, Payson McElveen), and some stay in AirBnBs (Sofia Gomez-Villafañe). Premium VIP tent setup/takedown service is available as add-on. (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/oregon-trail-gravel-grinder-2025-results-race-report/, https://www.oregontrailgravelgrinder.com/)

**"Die of Dysentery" Shirts:** Riders who DNF receive commemorative "Die of Dysentery" shirts referencing the Oregon Trail video game. (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/oregon-trail-gravel-grinder-2025-results-race-report/)
