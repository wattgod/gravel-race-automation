# OUACHITA CHALLENGE — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Jess Nankman [ELITE]:** "What a weekend, the perfect event experience. Great courses. Amazing volunteers. Spectacular race amenities such as camping, food, and showers. This is a race that both Nankmans would recommend. It has everything a race should have, there was nothing missing to make this a weekend of riding worth attending. Even if like us you drive from 20 hours away it will not disappoint." (https://nankmancycling.blogspot.com/2021/03/ouachita-challenge-race-beauty-and.html)

**Jess Nankman [ELITE]:** "5th female gravel race, 3rd female mountain bike race; 2nd for those that did both races" - Results from March 2021. "Honestly the best oatmeal I have ever had. I always asked for an extra scoop." (https://nankmancycling.blogspot.com/2021/03/ouachita-challenge-race-beauty-and.html)

**Anonymous rider [UNKNOWN] (Brickhouse Racing):** "My plan was to really concentrate on pacing myself. I tend to go out too fast then end up 'death marching' the last 20 or so miles of a race, so, when we hit a few rollers, I forced myself to sit back & spin while others kept the intensity up. It was painful to watch the ride away, but I knew that I wouldn't last the entire 60 miles if I stuck with the lead group." Finished 4th female, ~50 minutes behind winner Carey Lowery. (http://www.brickhouseracing.com/?p=1813)

**Anonymous rider [UNKNOWN] (Brickhouse Racing):** "I am really, really happy with my ride. I now have a really good feel for what type of pace I can sustain for that type of distance. I finished with a little bit of gas in the tank, so I know that next time, I can push a little harder in the parts where it'd be most advantageous to me (like windy fire road sections where I could either draft off of someone faster or put my head down and go at it TT style)." (http://www.brickhouseracing.com/?p=1813)

**Andrew Evans [ELITE]:** "Sometimes finishing in fourth can be disheartening, but this time I knew I had given it everything I could" - finished 14 seconds out of podium after an 8-minute flat tire repair at mile 16. "For the last 45 miles of the race I rode solo, getting in the aero bars as much as I could." (https://andrewevans.bike/2022/03/30/ouachita-challenge-recap/)

**Joël Nankman [ELITE]:** "16th male gravel, 28th mountain bike (mens field of almost 100 for gravel and over 100 for mtb); 12th combined" - March 2021 results (https://nankmancycling.blogspot.com/2021/03/ouachita-challenge-race-beauty-and.html)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Tire Durability - Critical Issue [ALL LEVELS]:**
- **Andrew Evans [ELITE]:** Sliced a hole in front tire sidewall "almost an inch long" on large rocks in creek crossing at mile 16 - plug wouldn't work, required tube. Lost 8 minutes. (https://andrewevans.bike/2022/03/30/ouachita-challenge-recap/)
- **Jess Nankman [ELITE]:** "Make sure your tire sealant is fresh and you carry flat fixing items; flat tires were numerous both days including Joel who did get two flats on the gravel day. Luckily Saucon Valley Bikes supplied us with lots of tubes and sealant to take along on this trip so flats could be fixed." (https://nankmancycling.blogspot.com/2021/03/ouachita-challenge-race-beauty-and.html)

**Aero Bars Experiment [ELITE]:**
- **Andrew Evans [ELITE]:** Used clip-on aero bars for gravel race on mostly flat roads after mile 25. "The clip-on bars would aid me in sustaining a long range solo attack over the climb at mile 24, or help me in a drag race to the finish if I tried to launch a move over the final climb." Used them extensively during 45-mile solo chase after flat. (https://andrewevans.bike/2022/03/30/ouachita-challenge-recap/)

**Gear Setup [ELITE]:**

**Creek Crossings [ELITE]:**

- **Jess Nankman [ELITE]:** "Creek crossings were numerous at both races, be ready for wet feet." (https://nankmancycling.blogspot.com/2021/03/ouachita-challenge-race-beauty-and.html)

**Climbing Characteristics [ELITE]:**

Mountain bike course includes "3 Ouachita trail mountains (Brushy, Blowout, and Chalybeate)" and later "Mauldin Mountain." (https://nankmancycling.blogspot.com/2021/03/ouachita-challenge-race-beauty-and.html)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Pacing Strategy - Death March Avoidance [UNKNOWN]:**
- **Anonymous rider [UNKNOWN] (Brickhouse Racing):** "I tend to go out too fast then end up 'death marching' the last 20 or so miles of a race, so, when we hit a few rollers, I forced myself to sit back & spin while others kept the intensity up. It was painful to watch the ride away, but I knew that I wouldn't last the entire 60 miles if I stuck with the lead group." Successfully maintained this disciplined pace across the first 3 mountains. (http://www.brickhouseracing.com/?p=1813)

**When to Push Hard [UNKNOWN]:**
- **Anonymous rider [UNKNOWN] (Brickhouse Racing):** Rider maintained conservative pace until final ~15 miles: "I was feeling good, so I decided it was time to burn the matches and empty the tank on the last bit of singletrack up & over Mauldin Mountain." Successfully caught and passed competitor Namrita O'dea who was "a couple of minutes ahead." Finished 4th female. (http://www.brickhouseracing.com/?p=1813)

**Chase Strategy Post-Mechanical [ELITE]:**
- **Andrew Evans [ELITE]:** After 8-minute flat at mile 16: "Part of me wanted to give up and ride in easy, but instead I went into chase mode, trying to catch as many racers as I could.

(https://andrewevans.bike/2022/03/30/ouachita-challenge-recap/)

**Drafting/Trading Pulls [UNKNOWN]:**
- **Anonymous rider [UNKNOWN] (Brickhouse Racing):** On 8-mile gravel stretch: "I made sure to keep my tempo pace nice & steady, and managed to find a guy to trade pulls with so we could make up a little time." (http://www.brickhouseracing.com/?p=1813)

**Nutrition Strategy [ELITE]:**
- **Jess Nankman [ELITE]:** "With the races being no more than three to six hours for us we easily carried all we needed including all out Honey Stinger nutrition in our back pockets."

**Front Group Dynamics [ELITE]:**
- **Andrew Evans [ELITE]:** "The racing was fairly calm at the start, and a large front group of around 30 to 40 riders was together as we hit the first checkpoint at mile 15." (https://andrewevans.bike/2022/03/30/ouachita-challenge-recap/)

## DNF Risk Factors
