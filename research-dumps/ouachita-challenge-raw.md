## **RACE REPORTS & RIDER EXPERIENCE**

**Specific Rider Experiences & Quotes**
From the 2021 Nankmans blog report[2]:
- Finishing time expectations: "For those who complete the 60 mile ride, expect a 7 to 9 hour ride and pack accordingly"[6]

- Prize structure: "There was a drawing for some really nice prizes at dinner on Saturday night"[2]
- Photo service: "A race photographer was present both days taking some amazing photos for purchase"[2]

**"What I Wish I Knew" Insights**
The official preparation guide emphasizes[6]:
- Pace yourself - "You will encounter a little bit of everything. Highway, Dirt Road, Single Track"
- Brake maintenance is critical: "Make sure that you have brand new brake pads installed. A wet day will destroy most brake pads"
- Mental preparation for terrain: "If you are feeling nervous about the width of the trail and the steep drop off, walk your bike for a while"

**Equipment Recommendations from Participants**
Official minimum recommended[6]:
- "Your bike should be in tip-top-shape"
- Carry: two new inner tubes, patch kit, tire pump, spoke wrench, Allen set, and chain tool (minimum)
- "This is a minimum. You cannot plan for every possibility, but you can try"
- Nutrition: "Energy bars and gel will help get you from one Aid Station to the next"
