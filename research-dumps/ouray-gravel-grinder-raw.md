## WEATHER

### San Juan Summer Climate

**Temperature Ranges:**
- Average High: 73F
- Average Low: 44F
- Can vary significantly with elevation - expect 10-20F cooler at passes

**Thunderstorm Danger - CRITICAL:**
- San Juan Range: 72-81 thunderstorm days per year (highest in Colorado)
- Monsoon Season: Early July through August
- Storm Pattern: Build in mountains starting around 11 AM
- **Golden Rule:** Plan to be below treeline by NOON

**Storm Characteristics:**
- Can go from blue skies to hailing in minutes
- Afternoon showers nearly guaranteed in summer
- Can last until after dark
- Flash flood risk in canyons and burn scars

**Lightning Protocol:**
- If you hear thunder or see lightning, you're in danger
- Don't be the tallest object or stand under tall objects
- Head down immediately from exposed ridges
- Alpine passes = extreme exposure

**Hypothermia Risk:**
- Even in summer, wet + wind + altitude = hypothermia conditions
- Rain gear mandatory even on clear mornings
- Temperature drops rapidly with elevation and storms

**Optimal Timing:**
- Early season (late June): Snow may still block high passes
- Mid-July to August: Monsoon peak but passes open
- September: Shorter weather window but calmer; early storms possible
- Weekdays better for traffic; after school starts ideal

## FORUM INSIGHTS

### High Altitude Racing Reality (From Bike Forums, Road Bike Review, etc.)

**Power Output Loss:**
- ~1% reduction per 1,000 ft of elevation
- At 12,000 ft: sustainable power drops to 70-80% of sea level capacity
- A 350W threshold rider may drop to 245-280W at 12,000 ft
- Above 9,000 ft: additional decline beyond the 10% baseline

**Heart Rate Effects:**
- At 6,500 ft: heart rate increases 10% over sea level
- Takes 2-3 weeks to normalize
- Racing before acclimation = artificially elevated HR throughout

**Recovery Impairment:**
- Hard efforts take longer to recover from
- Ability to repeat hard efforts diminishes significantly
- "If you overdo it you really can't recover. Your body goes cold."
- Suggestion: Have a bail-out gear for when you blow up

**Bonking vs. Altitude Effects:**
- At altitude, bonk-like symptoms can occur faster
- Glycogen depletion accelerated by increased breathing
- Confusion and poor decision-making compound with altitude
- True bonk: "Within 5 minutes you can go from feeling ok to just rotten"

**Forum Wisdom:**
- "Nothing will help you fully acclimatize for 4000m+ elevation"
- "Even grand tour pros complain about the altitude during the US Pro Tour"
- "Try your legs and lungs for a few days before tackling a long-distance ride"
- "After losing their lungs at altitude before, they knew to take a conservative approach"

### Acclimatization Forum Advice
- 2-3 weeks minimum for full acclimatization
- Altitude tents exist but are expensive
- "The only way to really do it is to go live at that altitude for a few weeks"
- VO2 max intervals at home can help by creating tissue hypoxia
- First week: just exist, don't really train

### DNF Stories and Warnings
- Leadville 100: ~47% DNF rate (typical)
- Ned Gravel 2022: "Took no prisoners" - fastest riders coming in bloody at mid-point
- Common theme: Underestimating the compounding effect of altitude + climbing + weather

## BLACK PILL

### The Brutal Truths About High-Altitude San Juan Gravel Riding

**Truth #1: You Cannot Train Enough at Sea Level**
There is no workout you can do at sea level that fully prepares your body for sustained efforts above 10,000 feet. Your power will be lower. Your recovery will be slower. Your HR will be higher. Accept this or stay home.

**Truth #2: The Passes Are Not "Rideable" in the Normal Sense**
- Imogene Pass: "Barely a road, a trail. Brutally steep and completely made of bare rock in certain sections."
- Alpine Loop: "Much harder to ride than expected, with much walking required on both passes"
- Even with optimal gearing, significant hike-a-bike is normal above 12,000 ft
- These are Jeep roads, not bike paths

**Truth #3: Weather Will Try to Kill You**
- 72-81 thunderstorm days per year in the San Juans
- Lightning at 13,000 ft on exposed rock = no shelter
- Hypothermia is a summer risk
- Flash floods happen downstream from storms you never saw

**Truth #4: The Altitude Sickness Is Real**
- 23% less oxygen at Ouray's base elevation alone
- Symptoms can hit anyone regardless of fitness
- Headache, nausea, confusion, fatigue - all while trying to make decisions on technical terrain
- Brain swelling is a severe risk if you ignore symptoms and push through

**Truth #5: The Numbers Lie**
- A 40-mile ride that would take 3 hours at home can take 6+ hours here
- 10,000 ft of climbing at 12,000 ft elevation is nothing like 10,000 ft in the Appalachians
- Minimum speed requirements on organized events? Many riders will DNF trying to meet them

**Truth #6: You're On Your Own**
- "The White River National Forest region of Colorado is an extremely remote area"
- "Participants are solely responsible for their personal well-being"
- "If they get into trouble, they have only their own wits and fortitude to help them"
- Cell service? Questionable. Rescue? Hours away.

**Truth #7: Your Gearing Is Probably Wrong**
- 34x36 cassette? "Barely enough at lower elevations"
- 34x42 or lower recommended for the serious passes
- "If given the option between a gravel bike with a 34x36 easy gear with 700c wheels versus a mountain bike, the recommendation is to go with the mountain bike"

**Truth #8: DNF Is Normal Here**
- Leadville 100: 47% DNF rate
- Ned Gravel: Riders coming in "bloody" at checkpoints
- High-altitude endurance events have higher attrition than flatland equivalents
- No shame in not finishing when the alternative is medical emergency

**Truth #9: The Beautiful Photos Are From Brief Windows**
- Those stunning Instagram shots? Taken in the 2-hour window before storms roll in
- The other 6 hours of your ride? Rain, hail, wind, suffering
- The aspens are pretty when you're not too hypoxic to notice them

**Truth #10: Some Sections Will Break Your Spirit**
- "Many a runner/rider has dismissed these sections during training and planning, only to find themselves death-marching it in for hours and hours"
- The mental game at altitude is as important as physical fitness
- Altitude affects decision-making and emotional regulation

- 75% effective in preventing acute mountain sickness (AMS)
- Side effects: tingling, increased urination, altered taste

**Emergency Awareness:**
- Most effective treatment: Descend immediately
- Oxygen available at some lodges/clinics
- Symptoms worsening = medical emergency
- Altitude sickness can cause brain swelling; don't be a hero

### Practical Logistics

**Getting There:**

- Denver is 5+ hours drive but good for first-night acclimation at 5,280 ft

**Services in Ouray:**
- Small town - limited hours, may close early
- Plan supplies before arrival
- Sunday services especially limited in Silverton, Lake City

**Bike Shop/Support:**
- Ouray Mountain Adventures offers e-bike rentals
- Limited full-service bike shops - bring spares
- Nearest comprehensive bike shop likely in Montrose or Durango

**Food/Nutrition:**
- Stock up before heading into backcountry
- Water abundant on routes but bring filtration
- Calorie needs higher at altitude - pack extra

## GRAVEL GOD RATINGS

### San Juan Mountains Region Overall

**Scenery: 10/10**
The "Switzerland of America" designation is earned. Jagged 13,000+ ft peaks, cascading waterfalls, historic mining towns, wildflower meadows, old-growth aspens. This is postcard Colorado at its finest.

**Terrain Challenge: 10/10**
This isn't Kansas gravel. Sustained 10%+ grades, 12,000+ ft passes, bare rock sections, hike-a-bike requirements. The San Juans don't give anything away.

**Altitude Difficulty: 10/10**
Starting at 7,800 ft, topping out at 13,000+ ft. This is among the highest gravel riding available in the Lower 48. Even the "easy" routes are above most people's experience ceiling.

**Weather Risk: 9/10**
Among the most thunderstorm-prone regions in Colorado. Monsoon season is brutal. The 2-hour riding window before noon is real. Hypothermia, lightning, flash floods all in play.

**Accessibility: 6/10**
Remote location. Limited airports. Small-town services. Need significant time for acclimation. Not a "fly in Friday, race Saturday" destination unless you enjoy suffering.

**Event Options: 5/10**
No specific "Ouray Gravel Grinder" event exists. Nearby Telluride Gravel Race is the closest organized option. Iron Horse in Durango. Otherwise, self-supported only.

**Beginner Friendliness: 2/10**
This is expert terrain. Even the "easy" Owl Creek Pass is at 10,000+ ft. Serious fitness, altitude experience, and self-sufficiency required.

**Overall Gravel God Rating: 8.5/10**
The San Juan Mountain region around Ouray is bucket-list gravel territory for those prepared to meet it on its terms. The scenery is unmatched, the challenge is severe, and the experience is unforgettable - for better or worse. This is where you go to prove yourself, not to have a casual Saturday ride. Come prepared or don't come at all.
