# OZARK GRAVEL — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Seth Wood [UNKNOWN]:** "I knew nothing of the lore of gremlin bells when I signed on for Ozark Gravel DOOM, at the urging of a friend after a coveted spot opened in the sold-out 2023 event. The race had been on my radar for some time, though I was intimidated by its 390-mile, mostly dirt, route that starts and finishes at the iconic Oark General Store... Anything billed as a throwdown by one of the hardest riders around – route designer and event organizer, Andrew Onermaa – was sure to test my limits." (https://theradavist.com/tag/ozark-gravel-doom)

**Anonymous rider [UNKNOWN]:** "6:27 a.m., Friday the 13th, 2022. Twenty-four grown-ass adults are walking around in circles ringing bells and there is a dude wearing a Scream mask counting down the minutes until a bike ride begins. What the F%#k is going on?" (https://theradavist.com/tag/ozark-gravel-doom)

**Anonymous rider (Angry Catfish) [UNKNOWN]:** "According to Andrew, the route is now in its final form with a caveat of 30 miles of single track. Ten miles to greet you at the front of the route, and 20 miles dropped near the end to remind you of the race's namesake. This is the real deal OG hand-cut single track, techy, steep, punchy, wet, double black diamond segments, and often not rideable. I'm confident I would have been faster leaving my 'gravel' bike at the top and trail-running the entire 20-mile segment." (https://www.angrycatfishbicycle.com/articles/doom-gravel-race-recap-pg374.htm)

**Anonymous rider [UNKNOWN] on Moccasin Creek crossing (mile 138):** "The water level was much higher than last year. I removed my shoes and socks and made it across with a couple of close calls of the current taking the bike right into me. The water was super refreshing. I made this way more intimidating than it needed to be even after crossing with ease last year." (https://www.angrycatfishbicycle.com/articles/doom-gravel-race-recap-pg374.htm)

**Maggie Livelsberger [ELITE]:** "I feel like I have a terrible imposter syndrome and one day people are going to be like, 'How did you pull this off? There's no way,'" Livelsberger said. "I never stopped enjoying being on the bike and I was really excited about the races I was doing this year, so I'm doing all right." (https://www.yahoo.com/news/single-speed-bike-erie-woman-100847578.html)

**Maggie Livelsberger [ELITE] on mental training:** "I remind myself when I'm riding, when I feel good, push it, because I'm not going to feel good forever." (https://www.yahoo.com/news/single-speed-bike-erie-woman-100847578.html)

**Shannon Allison [UNKNOWN] on Maggie's finish:** "She was just smiling ear to ear as if she didn't just ride 500 miles... She was on this race high and she was so excited when she found out she was first place." (https://www.yahoo.com/news/single-speed-bike-erie-woman-100847578.html)

**Tom Schwemberger [ELITE], 2025 Doom winner:** On his derailleur failure: "his derailleur system malfunctioned and made it such that his AXS batteries would drain, irrespective of use, within a few hours. To shift, Tom would have to get off his bike, and perform an odd, complex ritual of dead and live battery swapping in order to change one gear." (https://bikepacking.com/news/tom-schwemberger-wins-ozark-gravel-doom-2025/)

**Tom Schwemberger [ELITE]:** "Another incredible detail is that up until this race, Tom hadn't ever used caffeine for performance on ultra races. Not being a coffee drinker, it seems the 100mg pills he used to power through each night worked like a charm." (https://bikepacking.com/news/tom-schwemberger-wins-ozark-gravel-doom-2025/)

**Ed Rogers [ELITE]:** From the Dirty Chain Podcast discussing "The Rampage" - Ed's solo final push to regain position after sleep-related position loss. Rogers placed 2nd overall in 2023 and 4th in 2024. (https://komcycling.com/blogs/product-blogs/dirty-chain-podcast-episode-101-ozark-gravel-doom-with-ed-rogers)

**Andrew Onermaa [UNKNOWN], Race Director's own attempt:** "Gets to see Lindsay on course during her Yo-Yo return! Blows up trying to chase Kerkove's 2023 event time. Sleeps in a post office for long time. Gets hailed on next day and drinks a beer and sleeps at TAT shack. Finishes somewhere under 3 Days (it's a blur)." (https://www.ozarkgravelcyclists.com/doombikepacking)

## Weather Experienced

**2025 Dismay (April 4-5):**
- "Considering the windy, cold start, the conditions were less than ideal for anything resembling bike riding."
- "Days of biblical rains and brutal conditions made even the shortest courses in this year's event to be gargantuan undertakings."
- "Conditions will not significantly improve here in northwestern Arkansas until midday on Monday"
- "with a freeze warning tonight, who knows how many will remain"
(https://bikepacking.com/news/2025-ozark-gravel-doom-dismay-winners/)

**2024 conditions (from rider report):**
- "After the sun was fully up, the heat and sun got to me pretty bad"
- "the final stretch of this day was super wet, I ran into quite a few bigger water crossings and tons of small ones that soaked my feet early on in the day, and they never really dried out at all"
(https://www.angrycatfishbicycle.com/articles/doom-gravel-race-recap-pg374.htm)

**General climate note [UNKNOWN]:**
"Arkansas weather plays games—humidity, sudden storms, temperature swings that ruin race day plans... the region's notorious for unpredictable conditions. Spring races risk rain turning gravel into slip-and-slide misery."
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRT-yyIq1u4)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Route specifications (2024/2025 Doom):**
- 407 miles long with 44,000 ft of elevation (2024)
- 400+ miles with nearly 43,000 feet of gain (2025)
- "If you stay the course without wrong turns or resupply detours, most Folks end up with more."
(https://www.angrycatfishbicycle.com/articles/doom-gravel-race-recap-pg374.htm)

**Singletrack character [UNKNOWN]:**
"This is the real deal OG hand-cut single track, techy, steep, punchy, wet, double black diamond segments, and often not rideable. I'm confident I would have been faster leaving my 'gravel' bike at the top and trail-running the entire 20-mile segment." — 20-mile section near end of route
(https://www.angrycatfishbicycle.com/articles/doom-gravel-race-recap-pg374.htm)

**Specific climbs:**
"With a number of climbs that easily enter 25%+ grades, a broken electronic shifting system is less than ideal."
(https://bikepacking.com/news/tom-schwemberger-wins-ozark-gravel-doom-2025/)

**Final descents into Oark:**
"the final descents back into Oark are still some of the smoothest and seemingly longest ones of the route, and was so nice just to bomb these back to town"
(https://www.angrycatfishbicycle.com/articles/doom-gravel-race-recap-pg374.htm)

**Water crossings:**
- Moccasin Creek at mile 138: "The water level was much higher than last year" — current strong enough to nearly take bike
- Multiple crossings: "I ran into quite a few bigger water crossings and tons of small ones that soaked my feet early on in the day, and they never really dried out"
(https://www.angrycatfishbicycle.com/articles/doom-gravel-race-recap-pg374.htm)

**Venue change (2024):**
"An additional change to Doom is the start and finish have moved from the Oark General store in Oark, AR, to Horseshoe Canyon Ranch just outside of Jasper, AR."
(https://www.angrycatfishbicycle.com/articles/doom-gravel-race-recap-pg374.htm)

**2026 major change:**
"Though 2026 marks its first year in the Ouachitas, it carries forward the same depth, difficulty, and momentum shaped in the Ozarks... moving from Ozarks to Ouachita National Forest" with three distance options: Ouachita Doom (325+ miles, 32k+ vert, 110+ miles singletrack), The High Watch (200+ miles), and LOViT or Leave iT (116 miles).

(https://www.angrycatfishbicycle.com/articles/doom-gravel-race-recap-pg374.htm)

**Ed Rogers [ELITE] — planning emphasis:**
"The myth of big training volume – Ed's results with ⅓ of last year's volume" — emphasizes that "ultra-racing isn't just about fitness—it's about planning, preparation, mental resilience, and learning from experience."
(https://komcycling.com/blogs/product-blogs/dirty-chain-podcast-episode-101-ozark-gravel-doom-with-ed-rogers)

**Resupply strategy [UNKNOWN]:**
- Mile 119: Falling Water Church (water spigot) + Hillbilly Slims BBQ
- Mile 196: McCormick's One Stop in Harmony, AR — "This is a gas station, grocery store, delicatessen, and lifesaver... I ordered two large servings of biscuits and gravy with bacon on top and a sausage egg and cheese croissant to go."

- Mile 354: Top of the Mountain Grocery (was closed)
- Mile 370: Kent General (open, made-to-order food)

(https://www.angrycatfishbicycle.com/articles/doom-gravel-race-recap-pg374.htm)

**Nutrition reality [ELITE]:**
Maggie Livelsberger's breakfast during Arkansas High Country: "Push Pops, a jar of pickled green beans and uncooked ramen noodles. That was breakfast one morning... at a quick gas station stop during her 487-mile bike-packing race"
(https://www.yahoo.com/news/single-speed-bike-erie-woman-100847578.html)

**Tom Schwemberger [ELITE] — caffeine strategy:**
"up until this race, Tom hadn't ever used caffeine for performance on ultra races. Not being a coffee drinker, it seems the 100mg pills he used to power through each night worked like a charm."
(https://bikepacking.com/news/tom-schwemberger-wins-ozark-gravel-doom-2025/)

**Tom's position recovery [ELITE]:**
"Tom... started roughly 30 minutes after everyone had endeavored on those first, brutal climbs" because he forgot headphones and spare batteries, yet still won.
(https://bikepacking.com/news/tom-schwemberger-wins-ozark-gravel-doom-2025/)

## DNF Risk Factors

**High DNF rate:**
"It's considered one of the most difficult and craziest routes... There's a very high did-not-finish rate"
(https://www.yahoo.com/news/single-speed-bike-erie-woman-100847578.html)

**Mechanical failures:**
- Water filter failure at mile 119: "my previously tested filter was no longer filtering and needed a new filter!"
- Electronic shifting drain (Tom Schwemberger): batteries draining within hours, requiring off-bike battery swaps to shift
- Frame bag zipper failure (Tom Schwemberger): "broke the zippers on his frame bag very early on"
(https://www.angrycatfishbicycle.com/articles/doom-gravel-race-recap-pg374.htm and https://bikepacking.com/news/tom-schwemberger-wins-ozark-gravel-doom-2025/)

**Physical/mental breaking points [UNKNOWN]:**
Mile 250-293 section: "The rest of the day, from miles 196 to 293, was the most difficult of the entire race... My knee started to feel like shit despite the pain relief I had preemptively been taking all day, I was dehydrated and started stressing about the nutrition I had left... After the dreaded 20 miles of single track, I.WAS.COOKED... There was so much emotion here that I worked through some personal stuff! I'm still trying to decide if it was the best or the worst part of the race emotionally."
(https://www.angrycatfishbicycle.com/articles/doom-gravel-race-recap-pg374.htm)

**Navigation errors:**
"My computer didn't tell me I was off route, and I found myself re-routing on the Ozark National Forest hiking trail" — missed Hillbilly Slims BBQ resupply opportunity
(https://www.angrycatfishbicycle.com/articles/doom-gravel-race-recap-pg374.htm)

**Weather attrition (2025):**
"Days of biblical rains and brutal conditions... with a freeze warning tonight, who knows how many will remain"
(https://bikepacking.com/news/2025-ozark-gravel-doom-dismay-winners/)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Gremlin bell tradition:**
"A refreshing feature of Doom is that Andrew passes out gremlin bells 15 minutes before the race starts, and EVERY rider walks around their bikes ringing them to ward off evil spirits. We then attach the bells to our bikes and depart promptly at 7:00 am."
(https://www.angrycatfishbicycle.com/articles/doom-gravel-race-recap-pg374.htm)

**Race Director's commitment:**
"The episode also underscores the cultural magic of Doom, thanks in large part to race director Andrew's commitment to each finisher—waiting in the dark, offering hugs and beers at the barn, embodying the soul of grassroots endurance racing."
(https://komcycling.com/blogs/product-blogs/dirty-chain-podcast-episode-101-ozark-gravel-doom-with-ed-rogers)

**Venue atmosphere (Horseshoe Canyon Ranch):**
"Upon entering and traversing the 1.5mi descent into the valley to get to the trading post and restaurant, it's immediately evident that this is a special place. Beautiful bluffs, loblolly pines, creeks, and critters surround the Ranch. Eight cabins are on the property, with an additional boatload of camping space, a trading post/office, and a new restaurant with a beautiful overlook of the canyon valley."
(https://www.angrycatfishbicycle.com/articles/doom-gravel-race-recap-pg374.htm)

**Growth and reputation:**
"In 2025 it stood as the largest ultra-distance bikepacking event in the United States apart from the Tour Divide, and its reputation continues to grow"
"its legend grows with each edition, shaped by those who take it on and those who cheer them forward"
(https://www.ozarkgravelcyclists.com/doombikepacking)

**Cultural comparison:**
"why this race might be the 'Mid South' of bikepacking" — referencing its growing cultural significance
(https://komcycling.com/blogs/product-blogs/dirty-chain-podcast-episode-101-ozark-gravel-doom-with-ed-rogers)

**Inclusivity evolution:**
"Now offering multiple distance options, it welcomes both those dipping their toes into longer efforts and seasoned riders seeking their next great challenge."
Despair route (2024): "This option mimics something along the lines of the Vapor Trail 125 in CO with some neutral aid and more of a 'weekend warrior' mentality. An epic challenge for all, and very much so a race at the pointy end. Allowed many to dip their toes into the ultra-distance world"
(https://www.ozarkgravelcyclists.com/doombikepacking)

**Grassroots ethos:**
"Founded and Directed by Andrew Onerma of the Ozark Gravel Cyclists, Ozark Gravel Doom is a grassroots endurance gravel/MTB race"
(https://www.angrycatfishbicycle.com/articles/doom-gravel-race-recap-pg374.htm)

**Community building:**
Hellbenders Collective: "a community for women/femme/non-binary people interested in bikes, bikepacking and PA exploration... to create a resource for women — since there are a lot less doing events like this — to learn more about fixing bikes, to have references who they can talk to, to have group rides in areas that maybe they wouldn't have explored"
(https://www.yahoo.com/news/single-speed-bike-erie-woman-100847578.html)
