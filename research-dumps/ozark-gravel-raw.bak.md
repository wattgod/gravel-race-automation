I cannot find a gravel race called "Ozark Gravel" with the specifications you've provided (Rogers, Arkansas; 65 miles; 5000 ft elevation).

The search results returned several gravel and cycling events in Arkansas, but none match that exact name or location:

- **Randonneuring Gravel Rally of the Ozarks (RGRO)** – March 7, 2026, in Mountain Home, AR (not Rogers)[1][2]
- **DOOM** – A bikepacking event in the Ouachitas, March 2026[3]
- **OZ Gravel** – A community/route network in Northwest Arkansas (not a single timed race)[4]
- **Ozark Valley Triathlon** – Includes gravel events in June[5]
- **Arkansas Graveler** – A multi-day festival October 6-10, 2026[6]
- **Highlands Gravel Classic** – April 25, 2026, in Fayetteville (UCI-sanctioned)[7]

**It's possible that:**
1. "Ozark Gravel" may be a local or unofficial name for one of these races
2. The event may not exist or may have been cancelled
3. The name, location, or distance details you have may be slightly different from the official event name

If you can provide additional context (such as the race organizer's name, a website URL, or when you heard about this race), I can search more specifically. Alternatively, if you meant one of the events listed above, I'd be happy to research that race in detail.
