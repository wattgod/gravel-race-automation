# PARIS MOUNTAIN GRAVEL GRINDER — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Trimarni blogger [UNKNOWN]:** "The actual climb from the bottom of Paris Mountain (starting on Old Buncome) is 2.17 miles. You can also climb Paris Mountain starting on State Park Road/253, which is a 3.69 mile climb. In total - from one side to the other, it's ~5.8 miles." (https://trimarni.blogspot.com/2020/07/greenville-cycling-paris-mountain.html)

**Trimarni blogger [UNKNOWN]:** "According to my Garmin, the average grade (Old Buncome side) is ~6% but there are only two steep pitches (the first is around 7% and the last one at the top is ~10%. The climb has a few segments where you can change your cadence and pick up some speed - even though you are still climbing."

**Trimarni blogger [UNKNOWN]:** "Road condition: Great! The road was recently paved and compared to the road conditions around the area, I'd call this excellent. It's very smooth!" (https://trimarni.blogspot.com/2020/07/greenville-cycling-paris-mountain.html)

**Trimarni blogger [UNKNOWN]:** "From the Old Buncome side - start at 1168 feet and finish at 1972 feet (total gain = 1565 feet). From the State Park Road side - start at 1283 feet and finish at 1972 feet (total gain = 1690 feet)." (https://trimarni.blogspot.com/2020/07/greenville-cycling-paris-mountain.html)

**Trimarni blogger [UNKNOWN]:** "The descend has a few switch backs but nothing too tight. This is a good climb for those who are wanting to practice descending skills. I'd consider it a safe descend as you can always see where you are going (or which way the road is turning). Aside from the top when you start the descend, there are no segments where you would gain too much speed that you would feel out of control on your bike." (https://trimarni.blogspot.com/2020/07/greenville-cycling-paris-mountain.html)

**Trimarni blogger [UNKNOWN]:** "Aside from a written statement 'You made it' on the top of the climb (on the other side of the road), there's no view to enjoy at the top." (https://trimarni.blogspot.com/2020/07/greenville-cycling-paris-mountain.html)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Trimarni blogger [UNKNOWN]:** "Paris Mountain is home to many houses. However, it's a very popular cycling route (for example, Karel and I did three repeaters on Paris Mountain yesterday and we must have saw a dozen cyclists within an hour). Cars expect cyclists so I consider it a very safe bike route. There's plenty of room for cars to pass as you are climbing or descending."

**Trimarni blogger [UNKNOWN]:** "This is a go-to climb when you are visiting Greenville. Because it's just off the Swamp Rabbit Trail (by Furman University - off Roe Ford) and close to Traveler's Rest, it's a good option to include in your ride - especially if you want to get in some extra elevation." (https://trimarni.blogspot.com/2020/07/greenville-cycling-paris-mountain.html)

**Trimarni blogger [UNKNOWN]:** "If you are new to cycling or you don't have a lot of experience climbing on your bike, you'll feel incredibly attemping this climb. No matter how far you get up the climb, you'll feel accomplished." (https://trimarni.blogspot.com/2020/07/greenville-cycling-paris-mountain.html)
