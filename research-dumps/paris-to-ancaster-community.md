# PARIS TO ANCASTER — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Damian Bradley [COMPETITIVE]:** "This is where the race really begins. The following section was fast, hard-pack gravel road, causing splits in the field as things strung out. The goal became to drop those who were cracking, and find people to work with to start bridging gaps... My choice of tires and gearing gave me some serious speed on hard surfaces, but took a huge toll in the grassy meadows and muddy trails." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/paris-to-ancaster-2015-race-report-by-damian-bradley/)

**Damian Bradley [COMPETITIVE]:** "In the final 10 kilometres, this game finally took its toll. Unable to hold pace to stay on the tail of nearest group ahead, I rode solo, time trial style, through to the duo of waiting mud chutes. Thankfully, I navigated them sans drama... The last kilometre appeared, which featured a climb with a 20% gradient. For those without the luxury of a derailleur, this is a virtual wall. However, even for those racers with derailleurs, it was a case of walking, jogging or slogging up the incline." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/paris-to-ancaster-2015-race-report-by-damian-bradley/)

**Matt Surch [ELITE]:** "The crushed gravel under my tires replaced hardened steel and creosote-marinated wood years ago. Today's remnant of an artery once vital to eastern Canada's transportation network recedes into the horizon ahead, cool, yet infernal wind pushing against every leeward, straining square millimeter of my body... The wind, 35 kilometres per hour, blasts directly into us as we crest the hill, daring, mocking us to attack. I'm powerless to cause a split." (https://www.teknecycling.com/collection/how-the-race-was-won-paris-to-ancaster-2017)

**Matt Surch [ELITE]:** "O.M.F.G! Hands down, this is the nastiest, most energy sucking sector I've ever ridden a bike across. Picture a furrowed farm field, 4" deep trenches cut into the soil. Now picture a 'track' cutting diagonally across 800m of these bastards. Add 35kph headwind. Insane... For me, it's bad, just BAD. A few lines don't work out, I get bogged down - did I mention it's soggy? - a couple metres to Holmgren's wheel opens, I fight to regain contact, fail." (https://www.teknecycling.com/collection/how-the-race-was-won-paris-to-ancaster-2017)

**Kyra [COMPETITIVE]:** "In this stretch there was a huge downed tree on the single track, but other than that it's not clear why we were all walking. There was mud, but it shouldn't have caused such a back-up. I ended up chatting with the people around me while we walked, and stood still, including another triathlete. For the first 15-16k (before we hit this section) we had been making good time!" (https://kyraonthego.wordpress.com/2022/05/04/paris-to-ancaster-70k-2022-edition/comment-page-1/)

**Kyra [COMPETITIVE]:** "When a dozen or more 100k riders caught us, we were riding through a farm, on a series of hills that had mud pits at the bottom. They passed us at a high rate of speed, on the left, and on the right, weaving in and out of riders. It was pretty crazy. And it was incredible to see the speed and confidence with which they hit the mud pits! They just blasted straight though them." (https://kyraonthego.wordpress.com/2022/05/04/paris-to-ancaster-70k-2022-edition/comment-page-1/)

**Kyra [COMPETITIVE]:** "I suffered some abdominal pains for the last 20k of the race — not GI, not a side stitch — which made my pace slow. I've had them before, on both my road and mountain bikes, and only ever on long rides. I haven't figured out what causes them!" (https://kyraonthego.wordpress.com/2022/05/04/paris-to-ancaster-70k-2022-edition/comment-page-1/)

**Competitive athlete on AI Endurance [COMPETITIVE]:** "2017: In my first year my front wheel flatted with 2 km to go which meant I had to finish the race on foot. Placing: 77/1426... Performance: 228 W Avg Power/264 W Normalized Power (NP) for 2:23:04. FTP 300 W (4.2 W/kg) on 6 hours/week training." (https://aiendurance.com/blog/predicting-my-paris-to-ancaster-race-performance)

**Competitive athlete on AI Endurance [COMPETITIVE]:** "2019: Everything came together last year. Probably couldn't have gone better for my level of fitness and handling skills. Placing: 54/1560 (started elite wave). Performance: 247 W Avg Power/269 W NP for 2:17:27. FTP 300 W (4.2 W/kg) on 5 hours/week training." (https://aiendurance.com/blog/predicting-my-paris-to-ancaster-race-performance)

**Taison McIntyre [ELITE]:** "My choice of bike paid off at this point as the bend east was an uphill battle in sand and cobbles. Most of the race we were exposed to an unrelenting north east wind... The mountain bike choice helped again as I was able to crash through most of these sloppy sections! I'd say most people had to get off and walk their bike, which lead to choke points and bottle necks, limiting the edge of a mountain bike." (https://www.teamrunningfree.com/blog/2017/05/15/paris-to-ancaster-2017/)

**Bones [COMPETITIVE/ELITE]:** "I was in the lead group the whole day, so it was absolutely full-gas in the sectors and then a regroup (rinse repeat). For me it was very heavy on V02max, but if you are further back it would be more of a tempo/threshold effort." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/paris-to-ancaster-inaugural-canadian-gravel-championships/78869)

**Ashes1962 [COMPETITIVE]:** "Last year the 70km had some downed logs which most of the field dismounted for, five or six mudded bits of a 100 or more yards, and two 500 yard(ish) bits of mud which most mid-field riders walked. From a training perspective, there is nothing particularly serious to contend with. It's basically a three hour ride with a bunch of one to three minute efforts (hills) thrown in." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/paris-to-ancaster-inaugural-canadian-gravel-championships/78869)

**Ashes1962 [COMPETITIVE]:** "That said, bike selection is important … last year I pinch flatted and I wasn't the only one. I also lost 5 minutes or more clearing mud from my rim brakes. It's a sticky spring goo that picks up straw and sticks and doesn't clear naturally or easily. This year I'll ride it with a proper gravel bike set up tubeless." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/paris-to-ancaster-inaugural-canadian-gravel-championships/78869)

**Markea [COMPETITIVE]:** "I did the 70k route this past spring, which was actually about 56 km, if i remember correctly; I did not miss the extra 14 km... The route is a mix of pavement, packed gravel roads, loose gravel, farmer's fields, rail trails and sections of thick, goopy mud. I think that they water the muddy sections to make sure that they have not dried out before the race." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/paris-to-ancaster-inaugural-canadian-gravel-championships/78869)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Damian Bradley [COMPETITIVE] - Singlespeed Setup:** Rode a singlespeed cyclocross bike with 700c x 30mm slick tires. "My choice of tires and gearing gave me some serious speed on hard surfaces, but took a huge toll in the grassy meadows and muddy trails... On the sections of tarmac and gravel between 20 – 50 kilometres in, I found myself pulling along riders and bridging gaps, but doing far more work than I should have." Finished 8th in singlespeed category, 325th overall in 2:40 at 25.9 km/hr. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/paris-to-ancaster-2015-race-report-by-damian-bradley/)

**Taison McIntyre [ELITE] - Mountain Bike Setup:** "I settled on my mountain bike for few additional reasons worth mentioning. This bike uses a large 29 inch wheel and the larger circumference provides greater pedalling efficiency than a 27.5" or 26" wheel. The front suspension of this bike also has a lock out mechanism allowing me to toggle between speed demon and nimble mountain goat. I also pumped up my front/rear tyres to 45/40 PSI to reduce the overall rolling friction." Notes that 80% of bikes seen were cyclocross bikes. (https://www.teamrunningfree.com/blog/2017/05/15/paris-to-ancaster-2017/)

**Ashes1962 [COMPETITIVE] - Rim Brake Issues:** "Last year I pinch flatted and I wasn't the only one. I also lost 5 minutes or more clearing mud from my rim brakes. It's a sticky spring goo that picks up straw and sticks and doesn't clear naturally or easily. This year I'll ride it with a proper gravel bike set up tubeless." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/paris-to-ancaster-inaugural-canadian-gravel-championships/78869)

**Kyra [COMPETITIVE] - Bike Choice Matters:** Rode a mountain bike while her partner rode a gravel bike. "Kris and I rode mountain bikes, and Rebecca a gravel bike... Kris left us behind... She was doing an amazing job riding through the mud." Rebecca's shoe had a minor malfunction but they were able to continue. (https://kyraonthego.wordpress.com/2022/05/04/paris-to-ancaster-70k-2022-edition/comment-page-1/)

**Peter Glassford [COMPETITIVE] - Race Day Prep:** "Set up your race bike as if the race was this weekend and use all your gear, fueling, preparation in that key workout/ride. This is so big for confidence and also greatly reduces the chance of something small and silly ruining your first race. Worn pedals, loose bolts, leaking tires, seized cranks, slipping bars/posts, loosening cranks, broken chains and faulty tools are among most common 'silly' little things that stop us from JUST PEDALING on race day. And PSA: CHARGE YOUR BIKE IF YOU HAVE ELECTRONIC SHIFTING. Every year, someone DNFs P2A because they forgot to charge their gravel bike that's been in the garage all winter." (https://consummateathlete.com/5-ways-to-improve-your-race-the-weekend-before-paris-to-ancaster/)

## Weather Experienced

**2017 Race Day [from Matt Surch - ELITE]:** "April 30 was not exactly a nice day with a morning forecast of 3 degrees, intermittent showers, and wind speeds of 45 km/h. Buses dropped off athletes at 8:00 am with the first wave of athletes at 10:00 am. Many of the athletes, myself included, tried to hide in the wind shadow of the public washrooms with limited success. This was by far the most difficult and mentally taxing part of the day." He later describes experiencing "35 kilometres per hour, blasts directly into us as we crest the hill" and notes wind was a major factor throughout the race. (https://www.teknecycling.com/collection/how-the-race-was-won-paris-to-ancaster-2017 and https://www.teamrunningfree.com/blog/2017/05/15/paris-to-ancaster-2017/)

**2022 Race Day [from Kyra - COMPETITIVE]:** "The weather forecast for race day was an incredible 20+ degrees Celsius, unseasonably warm (and dry!) for this race. I wasn't alone wearing shorts, and many people were in short sleeves." (https://kyraonthego.wordpress.com/2022/05/04/paris-to-ancaster-70k-2022-edition/comment-page-1/)

**Race Organizer Perspective [John Thorpe - UNKNOWN]:** When asked if they water down sections in dry years: "I can't tell you. It's a rumour we can neither confirm nor deny." (https://www.thespec.com/sports/hamilton-region/oh-yes-there-will-be-mud-at-the-paris-to-ancaster-race-this-weekend/article_a8c1233f-ad19-5bed-acff-a9949d935b6a.html)

**Markea [COMPETITIVE]:** "I think that they water the muddy sections to make sure that they have not dried out before the race." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/paris-to-ancaster-inaugural-canadian-gravel-championships/78869)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**The Rail Trail Start [Multiple sources]:** The first 10km follows an old rail trail along the Grand River. Damian Bradley [COMPETITIVE]: "The first sector, a long, smooth double-track, went well, no issues there." The consensus is this section is fast but congested with the pack spreading out afterward. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/paris-to-ancaster-2015-race-report-by-damian-bradley/)

**Farm Field Sectors [Matt Surch - ELITE]:** "The sector that has us cutting across a swath of grass separating farm fields is about as 'euro cyclocross' as I've ever experienced: two parallel ruts, stacked up on a slope that descends from left to right, an intestinal tract stretched out before us, wind in our faces. Hold the wheel! Never before have I had to focus so intently to hold the wheel in front of mine." Describes another section: "Picture a furrowed farm field, 4" deep trenches cut into the soil. Now picture a 'track' cutting diagonally across 800m of these bastards. Add 35kph headwind." (https://www.teknecycling.com/collection/how-the-race-was-won-paris-to-ancaster-2017)

**Mud Chutes [Multiple sources]:** There are two infamous mud sections - the Powerline Mud Chute and the Mineral Springs Mud Chute. Kyra [COMPETITIVE]: "At the end of the Mineral Springs mud chute (through which I mostly pushed my bike, though I did ride a bit at the start of the mud)... Less than 2k later, I reached the Powerline mud chute, which I once again mostly pushed my bike through. Thankfully both mud chutes were downhill!" (https://kyraonthego.wordpress.com/2022/05/04/paris-to-ancaster-70k-2022-edition/comment-page-1/)

**Martin Road Final Climb:** Consistently described as brutal. Damian Bradley [COMPETITIVE]: "The last kilometre appeared, which featured a climb with a 20% gradient. For those without the luxury of a derailleur, this is a virtual wall." Kyra [COMPETITIVE]: "And then just like that, after 56.8k of riding, pushing and lifting my bike, I was at the start of Martin Road, which ends with the 20% grade hill and then a short straightaway to the finish line. The hill was more congested for me this year than it was previously, so I was worried that someone would stop right in front of me and I too would have to stop. But I got lucky, and managed to power my way to the top! This section had great spectators on both sides of the road cheering for the riders." (https://kyraonthego.wordpress.com/2022/05/04/paris-to-ancaster-70k-2022-edition/comment-page-1/)

**Sand and Cobbles Section [Taison McIntyre - ELITE]:** "The bend east was an uphill battle in sand and cobbles. Most of the race we were exposed to an unrelenting north east wind. There were a few areas where the course dipped into the forest providing shelter however, the forest had it's own challenges with mud and flooded stretches." (https://www.teamrunningfree.com/blog/2017/05/15/paris-to-ancaster-2017/)

**Choke Points [Kyra - COMPETITIVE]:** "In this stretch there was a huge downed tree on the single track, but other than that it's not clear why we were all walking. There was mud, but it shouldn't have caused such a back-up. I ended up chatting with the people around me while we walked, and stood still." (https://kyraonthego.wordpress.com/2022/05/04/paris-to-ancaster-70k-2022-edition/comment-page-1/)

**Course Variability:** Kyra [COMPETITIVE] notes her 2022 70k route "was actually about 56 km, if i remember correctly" - sections can be shortened day-of due to conditions. "We realized that for whatever reason, our race must have been shortened (this can happen due to poor conditions on course – for example, a section through private land that could be damaged if a thousand bikes ride through). We didn't mind the shortened course, though I would have liked to know before the race started (no announcement was made)." (https://kyraonthego.wordpress.com/2022/05/04/paris-to-ancaster-70k-2022-edition/comment-page-1/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Elite Race Dynamics [Bones - COMPETITIVE/ELITE]:** "I was in the lead group the whole day, so it was absolutely full-gas in the sectors and then a regroup (rinse repeat). For me it was very heavy on V02max, but if you are further back it would be more of a tempo/threshold effort." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/paris-to-ancaster-inaugural-canadian-gravel-championships/78869)

**Mid-Pack Experience [Ashes1962 - COMPETITIVE]:** "From a training perspective, there is nothing particularly serious to contend with. It's basically a three hour ride with a bunch of one to three minute efforts (hills) thrown in. How hard you go is up to you. You don't want to go in un-trained because if it's raining it could turn into a long slog, but otherwise it's a typical spring outing with the requisite gooey bits and a steep final climb." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/paris-to-ancaster-inaugural-canadian-gravel-championships/78869)

**Working in Groups [Damian Bradley - COMPETITIVE]:** "I found myself pulling along riders and bridging gaps, but doing far more work than I should have. I would typically start a move, and find 8 – 10 riders latched on behind, seldom offering to share the workload. Finally I clicked with a group from the Waterloo Cycling Club, who were wonderfully positive and a pleasure to ride with... I was a little too impatient and unwilling to slow my pace to sit in, deciding instead to suck up the lactic acid, and accept that my efforts would probably hurt me later in the day." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/paris-to-ancaster-2015-race-report-by-damian-bradley/)

**Power Data** [COMPETITIVE] **(AI Endurance athlete):** For context on pacing - this athlete's results across three years at ~300W FTP: "2017: 228 W Avg Power/264 W Normalized Power for 2:23:04... 2018: 230 W Avg Power/253 W NP for 2:25:56... 2019: 247 W Avg Power/269 W NP for 2:17:27." Notes: "Fitness for P2A is mainly about FTP as the mostly flat course and the small groups and slow surfaces make you keep constant pressure on the pedals. The duration of 2-2.5 hours makes it a sweetspot kind of effort." (https://aiendurance.com/blog/predicting-my-paris-to-ancaster-race-performance)

**Training Focus [Peter Glassford - COMPETITIVE]:** "Stop thinking about the Distance: Match the Terrain & Skill Demands Instead. The race is won on a potholed start, a loose gravel uphill (often with running), so look at doing 4-5 x 5-10min hard efforts (often through Forest trail as on left above) and accelerations out of forest/paths... Find a big hill and ride up it, maybe find a few and put one or two at the end of your ride this weekend. Push to that 'race pace' where you are noticing your breathing and ride there for a while (5+min)." (https://consummateathlete.com/5-ways-to-improve-your-race-the-weekend-before-paris-to-ancaster/)

**Dismount/Remount Skills [Peter Glassford - COMPETITIVE]:** "For many P2A athletes that first right hand turn off the rail trail will require a run-up… how fast you get off your bike, grab that top-tube and then at the top remount can make the difference between making a group that will carry you to a personal best finish or fighting in no-man's-land all day. Some of the forest trails are hectic and brief un-clipping or mount/remounts are required to keep moving forward." (https://consummateathlete.com/5-ways-to-improve-your-race-the-weekend-before-paris-to-ancaster/)

**Nutrition Issue [COMPETITIVE athlete on AI Endurance]:** "2018: Not having a great day and forgetting to eat and drink (excuses, excuses,...). Hit the wall with 10 km to go." (https://aiendurance.com/blog/predicting-my-paris-to-ancaster-race-performance)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Mechanical Issues [Multiple sources]:** 

- **Flats [COMPETITIVE athlete on AI Endurance]:** "2017: In my first year my front wheel flatted with 2 km to go which meant I had to finish the race on foot." (https://aiendurance.com/blog/predicting-my-paris-to-ancaster-race-performance)

- **Pinch Flats [Ashes1962 - COMPETITIVE]:** "Bike selection is important … last year I pinch flatted and I wasn't the only one." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/paris-to-ancaster-inaugural-canadian-gravel-championships/78869)

- **Rim Brake Clogging [Ashes1962 - COMPETITIVE]:** "I also lost 5 minutes or more clearing mud from my rim brakes. It's a sticky spring goo that picks up straw and sticks and doesn't clear naturally or easily." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/paris-to-ancaster-inaugural-canadian-gravel-championships/78869)

- **General Mechanical Prep [Peter Glassford - COMPETITIVE]:** "Worn pedals, loose bolts, leaking tires, seized cranks, slipping bars/posts, loosening cranks, broken chains and faulty tools are among most common 'silly' little things that stop us from JUST PEDALING on race day. And PSA: CHARGE YOUR BIKE IF YOU HAVE ELECTRONIC SHIFTING. Every year, someone DNFs P2A because they forgot to charge their gravel bike that's been in the garage all winter." (https://consummateathlete.com/5-ways-to-improve-your-race-the-weekend-before-paris-to-ancaster/)

**Bonking [COMPETITIVE athlete on AI Endurance]:** "2018: Not having a great day and forgetting to eat and drink (excuses, excuses,...). Hit the wall with 10 km to go." (https://aiendurance.com/blog/predicting-my-paris-to-ancaster-race-performance)

**COVID [Markea - COMPETITIVE]:** "It was a lot of fun, even though i believe that i contracted COVID in the shuttle bus!" (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/paris-to-ancaster-inaugural-canadian-gravel-championships/78869)

**Water Bottles [Kyra - COMPETITIVE]:** "In the first kilometer of the race scores of water bottles were knocked off the bikes and were scattered across the road! My guess is the early race congestion forced athletes into cycling over pot holes and any rigid frames would land with a thud dislodging peoples bottles! Luckily, I opted to race with a hydration pack to carry my water and bike tools so this was never an issue." (https://kyraonthego.wordpress.com/2022/05/04/paris-to-ancaster-70k-2022-edition/comment-page-1/)

**Cold Pre-Race Conditions [Taison McIntyre - ELITE]:** "Paris was miserable. April 30 was not exactly a nice day with a morning forecast of 3 degrees, intermittent showers, and wind speeds of 45 km/h. Buses dropped off athletes at 8:00 am with the first wave of athletes at 10:00 am. Many of the athletes, myself included, tried to hide in the wind shadow of the public washrooms with limited success. This was by far the most difficult and mentally taxing part of the day." (https://www.teamrunningfree.com/blog/2017/05/15/paris-to-ancaster-2017/)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Scale and History:** "Paris to Ancaster is Canada's largest race with over 2,000 riders attending this year. Participants run the full range of abilities. From the invited professional cyclists, who typically finish the course in around two hours, to recreational riders whose aim is simply to complete the race. It's amazing to see so many people having a great time on two wheels." - Damian Bradley [COMPETITIVE] (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/paris-to-ancaster-2015-race-report-by-damian-bradley/)

**Why People Race It [Damian Bradley - COMPETITIVE]:** "Thank You's: To the Paris to Ancaster promoters and volunteers, Gravel Cyclist for the race entry, my True North teammates, frame builder Hugh Black for my amazing frame, and to everybody I raced with." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/paris-to-ancaster-2015-race-report-by-damian-bradley/)

**Announcer Perspective [Steve Fleck - UNKNOWN]:** "This is one of the great bicycle races in all of North America. It's had over 2,000 riders, upwards of 3,000 riders a few years ago. The super cool thing is it's a race and a ride for everyone – anyone can do this. We've had some of the best cyclists in Canada on the start line and we've had people who have been training all winter in their basement just to be here. It really challenges riders. The terrain, you have to deal with mud, you've got to deal with ruts, hills, and gravel." (https://www.thespec.com/sports/hamilton-region/oh-yes-there-will-be-mud-at-the-paris-to-ancaster-race-this-weekend/article_a8c1233f-ad19-5bed-acff-a9949d935b6a.html)

**Finish Line [Kyra - COMPETITIVE]:** "And then just like that, after 56.8k of riding, pushing and lifting my bike, I was at the start of Martin Road, which ends with the 20% grade hill and then a short straightaway to the finish line... This section had great spectators on both sides of the road cheering for the riders, which helped push me up it. And then just like that... I was at the finish line and Steve Fleck was announcing my name!" (https://kyraonthego.wordpress.com/2022/05/04/paris-to-ancaster-70k-2022-edition/comment-page-1/)

**Post-Race [Taison McIntyre - ELITE]:** "Finish line celebrations were held in the Community Centre where they had a BBQ, beer, and live music. For an extra $5.00, you could have your bike cleaned, with all proceeds going to a local youth cycling group." (https://www.teamrunningfree.com/blog/2017/05/15/paris-to-ancaster-2017/)

**Support Services [Multiple sources]:** "The entire course was very well marked with police officers at all road intersections directing traffic." - Taison McIntyre [ELITE]. "At one point in the race, P2A provided power washers to clean off the bikes. A quick water blast helped keep the drive train clean and in working order! Shimano technicians were also at the wash station to lend a hand for any technical issues." - Taison McIntyre [ELITE] (https://www.teamrunningfree.com/blog/2017/05/15/paris-to-ancaster-2017/)

**On-Course Support [Kyra - COMPETITIVE]:** "At the end of the Mineral Springs mud chute... my dad, husband, and daughter were waiting for me! Alasdair had brought tools with him to help people clean mud and debris from their bikes." (https://kyraonthego.wordpress.com/2022/05/04/paris-to-ancaster-70k-2022-edition/comment-page-1/)

**The Vibe [Ashes1962 - COMPETITIVE]:** "From a training perspective, there is nothing particularly serious to contend with... Amongst the Cervelos and 3Ts you'll see people in running shoes, milk crates on their rear rack (yup), helmets on backwards (yup) and all manner of creaky old bikes. The volunteers are fabulous. The finish hill is type-two fun and it's got a festival vibe all round." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/paris-to-ancaster-inaugural-canadian-gravel-championships/78869)

**Why Organizer John Thorpe Started It:** "Back in 1994, he was one of the three founders of the annual ride along with Tim Farrar and Chris Kiriakopoulos. As avid racers, they wanted to extend the riding season a bit. At which point, one of them mentioned an event in Europe called Paris to Roubaix. 'By the time it's finished, the riders are covered in mud and bone shaking,' he says of that French offering. Sounds perfect, they thought. Slightly sadistic, but perfect. Let's replicate that here." (https://www.thespec.com/sports/hamilton-region/oh-yes-there-will-be-mud-at-the-paris-to-ancaster-race-this-weekend/article_a8c1233f-ad19-5bed-acff-a9949d935b6a.html)

**Registration Experience [Taison McIntyre - ELITE]:** "I arrived at the Ancaster Community Centre well ahead time to do my bike checks and to ensure I had enough time for registration. I found the registration process very efficient and well organized." (https://www.teamrunningfree.com/blog/2017/05/15/paris-to-ancaster-2017/)

**The Mud Badge of Honor:** "Everyone who rides the Paris to Ancaster race wants a photo just like this one on their mantle, agrees co-organizer John Thorpe." Caption under photo of mud-covered rider. (https://www.thespec.com/sports/hamilton-region/oh-yes-there-will-be-mud-at-the-paris-to-ancaster-race-this-weekend/article_a8c1233f-ad19-5bed-acff-a9949d935b6a.html)

**Peter Glassford's Perspective [COMPETITIVE]:** "Remember to Enjoy your training and Race Day – Smile + Recruit Friends. It is cliche but RELAX and ENJOY. You will survive and you will have a smile at the end and some great stories. The reason to race is to push yourself to new limits and situations AND MOST IMPORTANT to make great friends to share the journey with. I always look forward to chatting with old friends and making new friends at races. The shared experiences are something we will chat (and exaggerate about) for years."
