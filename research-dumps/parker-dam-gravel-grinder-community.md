# PARKER DAM GRAVEL GRINDER — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Lynn Botelho [UNKNOWN]:** "Thanks to BaseCamp coaches and community, I had a great ride, with great results, and (luckily) with great weather. I won my age group and was the 3rd woman overall. I kept my day before, day of, and during race nutrition as before -- and even remembered to make sure my hydration pack was actually functioning this time!" (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/lynns-story-parker-dam-gravel-grinder)

**Lynn Botelho [UNKNOWN]:** "This is a relatively flat course for this part of the world, I decided to try setting a fairly high (for me) pace and to hold it throughout the race. A very fast friend who was allowed to start the race late caught up with me at mile 30. I grabbed his wheel and remembered that I could ride faster. His timing was perfect, and it was a great confidence boast for those few miles." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/lynns-story-parker-dam-gravel-grinder)

**Lynn Botelho [UNKNOWN]:** "I remain thankful that I descend like a demon. 😉 However, the race ends with about a 12-mile hill, and my goal here was to 'just be tired tomorrow' and do the work now. I was able to pass a few people and was only overtaken by an elite rider in the long course." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/lynns-story-parker-dam-gravel-grinder)

**Mark Loux [UNKNOWN] (Ohio Gravel Grinders recap):** "The first 25 miles stays up on the ridgetop and barely fluctuates a couple hundred feet up or down... A little while later Helena's group rolled on and left us to enjoy the day. We had some muddy double track and then popped out onto the paved Quehanna Highway section which features a 3 mile downhill."

**Mark Loux [UNKNOWN]:** "The gravel is mostly hard packed and there was very little loose gravel sections. We had two double track sections that could be muddier than what we experienced. Overall the route sections we completed were very beautiful and passed by a lot of private camps tucked into the countryside."
