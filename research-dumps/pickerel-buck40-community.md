# PICKEREL BUCK40 — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Shane Hitz [ELITE]:** "This route is hard, no doubt about it. It has two sections of old school singletrack the first being four miles long... It has about 20% roads that are gnarly chunk or unrelenting sand. The sand is worse this year because of the drought. This area hasn't had meaningful rain since the beginning of May so in a normal year the sand would be a bit tamer." (https://www.ironbull.org/fkt-leaderboard)

**Shane Hitz [ELITE]:** "Definitely had a tough go at this on day one. Ended the first night at around 10:00. I was pretty gutted but thanks to a friend for inspiring me to get rest and rethink my situation in the morning... So Tuesday I woke up, felt renewed, went through the first set of muddy two track having fun and was back in a better set of mind." (https://www.ironbull.org/fkt-leaderboard)

**Chris Schotz [ELITE]:** "Shane is upfront about how tough some of this terrain can be. It's an adventure with a few grinds and great rewards. Riding the SoNic in one go is a lot like the infamous Crusher up in Michigan - enhanced gravel with truck road surprises." (https://www.ironbull.org/fkt-leaderboard)

**Chris Schotz [ELITE]:** "Around mile 50 SoNic encounters the legendary Nicolet-Roche singletrack known for massive boulders and the Wolfman Triathlon that will be coming the opposite direction Saturday morning only. It's an old school trail ride with tricks that leads to the Humble Hill area where you can expect to push up at least three rocky climbs." (https://www.ironbull.org/fkt-leaderboard)

**Nick Holzem [ELITE]:** "Butler Rock area was tough, loose big rock, and plenty of sand... Night riding was slower than I imagined. I made it to the Nicolet Roche mountain bike section and finished my day similarly to how it started, riding mountain bike trails." (https://www.ironbull.org/fkt-leaderboard)

**Nick Holzem [ELITE]:** "Next up a final long ascent up to the Kent Lookout tower, then all downhill from there. I rolled back into Jack Lake before noon and jumped in the clear and cool waters of Jack Lake." (https://www.ironbull.org/fkt-leaderboard)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Shane Hitz [ELITE]:** Used "a bone stock Surly Karate Monkey single speed 32/20 gearing with 2.25 tires" for a 225-mile route that shares terrain with Pickerel Buck40. (https://www.ironbull.org/fkt-leaderboard)

**Chris Schotz [ELITE]:** "I normally run a loaded Fargo with 29x2.6 tires, but for the FKT I rode a stripped down gravel bike with 700x50 tires - the minimum to get it done." Notes that 700x50 is the minimum tire size to handle the terrain effectively. (https://www.ironbull.org/fkt-leaderboard)

**Nick Holzem [ELITE]:** Rode Trek's new Checkout bikepacking bike as a "full suspension rig" for the related 365-mile Tour de Nicolet route which shares sections with Pickerel Buck40. (https://www.ironbull.org/fkt-leaderboard)

## Weather Experienced

**Shane Hitz [ELITE]:** In June, experienced drought conditions with no meaningful rain since beginning of May, making sand worse than normal. "The heat was cranking so I did use almost all of the four liters I was carrying on one section." (https://www.ironbull.org/fkt-leaderboard)

**Nick Holzem [ELITE]:** In late September, found "a few days of dry and warm conditions, with elevated temperatures in the 70's and overnights lows in the 40's." (https://www.ironbull.org/fkt-leaderboard)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Course organizer description:** "The route is designed to take riders to remote and hard-to-get-to and unknown places often traveling through overgrown vegetation and sometimes shouldering your bike over downed trees. In June, you can expect muddy two-track and be prepared for a river ford." (https://www.ironbull.org/pickerel-buck40)

**Course composition:** 33% paved, with the explanation: "For a gravel route, it is high in pavement with 33% paved but with all the difficult sections you will need those easy miles to get this route done in under 10 hours." (https://www.ironbull.org/pickerel-buck40)

**Specific features noted on route:**
- Cathedral Pines at mile 3
- 2019 derecho damage at mile 10
- Saul Springs at mile 26
- River ford at mile 28
- Ed's Lake Trail at mile 80
- Big Bear Overlook at mile 115
(https://www.ironbull.org/pickerel-buck40)

**Chris Schotz [ELITE]:** Described encountering "the muddy mile made famous in the Bear 100 gravel race" and saw "a fairly good sized bear at dusk" on the route. Also noted "loose rock and washboards" and abundant side-by-side ATVs on the Nicolet Trail around Lakewood. (https://www.ironbull.org/fkt-leaderboard)

**Nick Holzem [ELITE]:** "The section after Lakewood shares the steep ATV trails as the Pickerel Buck 40, these were even harder at night despite the ATV club doing some trail repairs since earlier this year." (https://www.ironbull.org/fkt-leaderboard)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Shane Hitz [ELITE]:** Carried four liters of water due to heat, which was nearly all consumed on one section. Notes there are "only two resupply options, Pickerel or Waubee Lodge." (https://www.ironbull.org/fkt-leaderboard and https://www.ironbull.org/pickerel-buck40)

**Chris Schotz [ELITE]:** When attempting fast time on related route, "passed all the good eating and resupplied at two gas stations along the way which was sufficient with two bottles, a hydration pack and ideal weather." (https://www.ironbull.org/fkt-leaderboard)

**Nick Holzem [ELITE]:** "I had originally planned to ride it evenly spaced over 3 days; 140, 130, and 90 the last day. This would put me at Morgan Lake and Bagley Rapids campgrounds each night with opportunities to rinse off in the lake/stream." Eventually modified plan after strong first day performance.

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Event description:** "This is an old school free gravel bike ride so be prepared to support yourself... Use paper cue sheets, gpx, or your phone to navigate because the course is not marked." Event is free and "We encourage riders to enjoy the social aspect and join the group departing June 1, 2025 at 7 am, but you may complete the ride anytime in June." (https://www.ironbull.org/pickerel-buck40)

**Chris Schotz [ELITE]:** Regarding ATV riders on shared trails: "They're nice enough and always have a cooler. They might offer a beer if you show off or something. It was just a Miller Lite, but it left me able to navigate the loose rock and washboards." (https://www.ironbull.org/fkt-leaderboard)

**Shane Hitz [ELITE]:** "Camping in dispersed spots in the National Forest is always a magical experience when doing stuff like this." (https://www.ironbull.org/fkt-leaderboard)
