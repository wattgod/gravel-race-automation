# PIRATE CYCLING LEAGUE GRAVEL — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Austin Morris [ELITE]:** "150 miles in 8:28.42 on gravel was no small task. I reached new levels of pain and suffering that I have never experienced before... We established a small gap, and were soon joined by two riders who bridged across from the chasing group." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/gravel-worlds-race-report-by-austin-morris/)

**Austin Morris [ELITE]:** "Rob and I were suffering hard. Working to keep team leader Bob out of the wind at every chance, we did our best until muscle cramps set in around the 100 mile mark." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/gravel-worlds-race-report-by-austin-morris/)

**JOM [ELITE]:** "I don't recall where I heard it, but someone over the weekend remarked there were 87 hills along the full 150-mile course... As a reminder, I spend a lot of my year in Florida, and even though there are some decent hills where I live, they don't hold the remotest flicker of a candle to the hills of Lincoln, Nebraska. With zero hill training, what could possibly go wrong?!" (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-150-hot-miles-of-the-2018-gravel-worlds-and-about-87-hills-lincoln-nebraska-usa/)

**JOM [ELITE]:** "Those 80-90-100ish miles were some of the hardest. The headwind, the rising heat... These miles are where you start chunking things… ride to the next checkpoint, the next turn, that tree in the distance, that rock on the ground..." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-150-hot-miles-of-the-2018-gravel-worlds-and-about-87-hills-lincoln-nebraska-usa/)

**Adrienne Taren [ELITE]:** "Per my usual takes-forever-to-warm-up style, I let the super fast kids go, watched the sunrise, and found myself riding a nice steady 15mph pace to Checkpoint 1, which is just what happens when you heave your bike uphill at 10mph and fly downhill at 20-some mph over and over again, because this course is all rollers." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/single-speeding-at-2019-gravel-worlds-lincoln-nebraska-by-adrienne-taren/)

**Adrienne Taren [ELITE]:** "Those 80-90-100ish miles were some of the hardest. The headwind, the rising heat... Turn the corner and nothing but one long gravel road of giant rollers. Back into the headwind... Souls were crushed on that road." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/single-speeding-at-2019-gravel-worlds-lincoln-nebraska-by-adrienne-taren/)

**Dirt Tan Bike Club blogger [COMPETITIVE]:** "Lincoln had been murderously hot all week, with heat indexes nosing toward 120. I worried I'd have to tell my brother... The rain reached the roof of Pete's camper just after midnight on race day, and I was glad for it. That's the sound of a heatwave dying, I told the ceiling." (https://dirttanbikeclub.com/category/race-recaps/)

**Dirt Tan Bike Club blogger [COMPETITIVE]:** "I spent the last third of my seventh Solstice 100 in a bonked bewilderment. And I couldn't tell you why. Was I falling sick? Did the squishy roads zap more energy than I realized? Did I foul up my food? My pacing?" (https://dirttanbikeclub.com/category/race-recaps/)

**Andrew 'Lespy' L'Esperance [ELITE]:** "Some riders finishing inside the top-10 of the Life Time Grand Prix (LTGP), the world's most prestigious off-road series, are barely breaking even, let alone earning a salary." (https://www.cyclingnews.com/pro-cycling/riders-making-six-figures-race-against-some-who-arent-making-a-cent-are-pro-gravel-teams-about-to-be-the-end-of-the-privateer/)

**Payson McElveen [ELITE]:** "Gravel races forbid team tactics, which opens the door for more creativity and storytelling." (https://www.cyclingnews.com/pro-racing/riders-making-six-figures-race-against-some-who-arent-making-a-cent-are-pro-gravel-teams-about-to-be-the-end-of-the-privateer/)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**JOM [ELITE]:** "I was super confident in my wheel and tyre choice for this race, namely the Xentis Kappa2 650b 4-spoke carbon wheelset and WTB Resolute 650b x 42mm tyres. Both items were rolling fast and handled the loose stuff with ease." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-150-hot-miles-of-the-2018-gravel-worlds-and-about-87-hills-lincoln-nebraska-usa/)

**Adrienne Taren [ELITE] - Single Speed setup:** "42×18 seems to lead to fewer near-death experiences while still providing both simplicity and suffering."

## Weather Experienced

**2015:** "20 mph headwinds" throughout the race. "The first hour of the race was held in darkness." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/gravel-worlds-race-report-by-austin-morris/)

**2018:** "It was warm and relatively humid for this part of the world. Drip, drip, drip went the perspiration from the bill of my cap worn beneath my helmet... The predicted high temperature was 88 degrees Fahrenheit, or about 31 degrees Celcius." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-150-hot-miles-of-the-2018-gravel-worlds-and-about-87-hills-lincoln-nebraska-usa/)

**2019:** "The fiery rays of the sun started to beat down upon us with a fury, and I take back all the nice things I said about the corn earlier because it turns out that corn provides NO SHADE." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/single-speeding-at-2019-gravel-worlds-lincoln-nebraska-by-adrienne-taren/)

**2023:** "Lincoln had been murderously hot all week, with heat indexes nosing toward 120... The rain reached the roof of Pete's camper just after midnight on race day." (https://dirttanbikeclub.com/category/race-recaps/)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Course elevation:** "Approximately 150 miles and near 10,000 ft of climbing – adventuring through the rural farmlands of Southeastern Nebraska." (https://www.komoot.com/user/gravelworlds)

**Hills count:** "Someone over the weekend remarked there were 87 hills along the full 150-mile course." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-150-hot-miles-of-the-2018-gravel-worlds-and-about-87-hills-lincoln-nebraska-usa/)

**Road conditions:** "The roads were almost entirely hardpack and in great shape... The gravel roads were in primo condition although one had to be mindful of the deep sections of gravel that proliferated some parts of the course." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/single-speeding-at-2019-gravel-worlds-lincoln-nebraska-by-adrienne-taren/)

**Course character:** "It's all rollers. A pirate-y rollercoaster as far as the eye can see. And corn. Lots of corn. More corn than I've ever seen in my life." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/single-speeding-at-2019-gravel-worlds-lincoln-nebraska-by-adrienne-taren/)

**The brutal finish section (miles 140-148):** "Turn the corner and nothing but one long gravel road of giant rollers. Back into the headwind... I passed a dude standing over his bike with his head on his handlebars. I yelled at that dude because we were literally three miles from the finish. But I get it, you may be 3 miles away but there's no civilization in sight and at least three more big hills that you can see right in front of you and you're baking in the sun. Souls were crushed on that road." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/single-speeding-at-2019-gravel-worlds-lincoln-nebraska-by-adrienne-taren/)

**Early course:** "Hero gravel" leaving Checkpoint 2 for about 10 miles with tailwind before the brutal finish section. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/single-speeding-at-2019-gravel-worlds-lincoln-nebraska-by-adrienne-taren/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Elite pacing [ELITE]:** "The lead group of 30 was averaging 21 mph, on loose gravel with rolling hills!" in the first hour after sunrise. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/gravel-worlds-race-report-by-austin-morris/)

**Elite breakaway [ELITE]:** "The real action of the day began at mile 30, when a super strong breakaway comprising Brian Jensen and Neil Shirley jumped clear. They would never be seen again. An believable effort for two men in those windy conditions!" (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/gravel-worlds-race-report-by-austin-morris/)

**Elite team tactics [ELITE]:** "Our four man squad was working hard into the strong winds, but it took a toll on Nate. He fell ill around the 75 mile mark and had to pull out of the race... Rob and I were suffering hard. Working to keep team leader Bob out of the wind at every chance." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/gravel-worlds-race-report-by-austin-morris/)

**Pacing strategy [ELITE]:** "Riding a 150-mile / 240 kilometre gravel race is about metering one's effort in doses, and mentally breaking up the race into small manageable chunks. My Garmin may have read '200-something kilometres until the finish', but I think about the distance between now and the next point of interest." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-150-hot-miles-of-the-2018-gravel-worlds-and-about-87-hills-lincoln-nebraska-usa/)

**Warm-up style [ELITE]:** "Per my usual takes-forever-to-warm-up style, I let the super fast kids go, watched the sunrise, and found myself riding a nice steady 15mph pace to Checkpoint 1, which is just what happens when you heave your bike uphill at 10mph and fly downhill at 20-some mph." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/single-speeding-at-2019-gravel-worlds-lincoln-nebraska-by-adrienne-taren/)

**Mental chunking [ELITE]:** "Those 80-90-100ish miles were some of the hardest. The headwind, the rising heat... These miles are where you start chunking things… ride to the next checkpoint, the next turn, that tree in the distance, that rock on the ground." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-150-hot-miles-of-the-2018-gravel-worlds-and-about-87-hills-lincoln-nebraska-usa/)

**Checkpoint strategy [ELITE]:** "A very nice volunteer at Checkpoint 2 invited me to sit down, which I decided was a bad idea, but I did sip some Coke and spray some sunscreen over the portions of me which weren't covered with dirt. Then I bumbled my way out of there before any sitting down could happen because getting up is hard." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/single-speeding-at-2019-gravel-worlds-lincoln-nebraska-by-adrienne-taren/)

**Nutrition note [ELITE]:** "If an opportunity for a pickle presents itself, you should always take it." At checkpoint. "If you're a salty sweater and have ever eaten salsa with a spoon after a particularly long ride, raise your hand." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/single-speeding-at-2019-gravel-worlds-lincoln-nebraska-by-adrienne-taren/)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Cramping [ELITE]:** "Rob and I were suffering hard... we did our best until muscle cramps set in around the 100 mile mark. We bid farewell to Rob at round mile 110. He rolled the final 40 miles of the race solo." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/gravel-worlds-race-report-by-austin-morris/)

**Crashes:** "Nathaniel... took a nasty spill into a ditch after losing it on a sharp and loose gravel corner" around mile 40. He recovered and rejoined but eventually fell ill and pulled out around mile 75. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/gravel-worlds-race-report-by-austin-morris/)

**Heat exhaustion [ELITE]:** "I passed a dude standing over his bike with his head on his handlebars... three miles from the finish." In the brutal miles 140-148 section. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/single-speeding-at-2019-gravel-worlds-lincoln-nebraska-by-adrienne-taren/)

**Bonking [COMPETITIVE]:** "I spent the last third of my seventh Solstice 100 in a bonked bewilderment. And I couldn't tell you why. Was I falling sick? Did the squishy roads zap more energy than I realized? Did I foul up my food? My pacing?" (https://dirttanbikeclub.com/category/race-recaps/)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Origin philosophy:** "We started out as a group of friends who loved riding and just wanted to play bikes without all the rules. Like kids on a playground we made up our own rules together as we went and nicknamed each other the Pirate Cycling League. No Categories, no officials, no prize money, just bumping elbows, bleeding lungs, blown up legs, with beers and stories at the finish." (https://www.komoot.com/user/gravelworlds)

**Inclusivity mission:** "The game has grown over the last decade to fit in all the people who want to come play. We have some rules now. We sometimes have to be the 'officials' but we are staying true to our roots and just want to have fun playing bikes. Some come to race some come to ride but we all share the same road." (https://www.komoot.com/user/gravelworlds)

**PCL philosophy:** "The Pirate Cycling League was created to be a club for everyone... 'Pirate Cycling League was created from the desire to create community, ride bikes, have less rules and be more inclusive. It may sound simple now, but 15 years ago this was the opposite of most clubs out there.'" - Craig Schmidt, founder. (https://www.gravelworlds.com/blog/pirate-cycling-league-celebrates-15-years-of-two-wheeled-adventures)

**Community impact:** "The PCL was and continues to be the club for those without a club, and lives by just one rule, 'Be cool'... The PCL has been focused on community since day one." - Corey Godfrey. (https://www.gravelworlds.com/blog/pirate-cycling-league-celebrates-15-years-of-two-wheeled-adventures)

**Personal impact:** "I'm an example of the byproduct of this incredible club. The first time I found community and ultimately fell in love with cycling was because of the Pirate Cycling League. I'm just one of hundreds around the world whose lives have been changed because they have found joy and community through the PCL." - Jason Strohbehn. (https://www.gravelworlds.com/blog/pirate-cycling-league-celebrates-15-years-of-two-wheeled-adventures)

**Post-race scene:** "There were chairs in shade and ice towels... Schillingbridge Tap House is at the finish line. Pizzas and chips and salsa were ordered... The awards ceremony was pretty well-attended, particularly since it can be viewed from the bar patio... Festivities continued with a raffle that went on for a very long time simply because there was literally a stage-sized pile of free stuff to give away, lots of drinking and eating of second pizzas on the patio, and enthusiastic cheering-in of riders who continued to arrive well into the evening." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/single-speeding-at-2019-gravel-worlds-lincoln-nebraska-by-adrienne-taren/)

**Pro prize structure:** "A newly formed $15,000 donation based prize pool that is the first of its kind at a major gravel race. The top 5 of the pro men's and pro women's podiums, and top 3 of the Non-Binary/Gender Expansive, Para-Man, and Para-Woman categories will split a prize pool that will be donated to the Non-Profit (501c3 Organization) of the podium winners' choosing." (https://www.gravelworlds.com/blog/garmin-gravel-worlds-announces-pro-category-with-donation-based-prize-pool)

**Charitable impact:** "The result is more than $100,000 raised through Gravel Worlds and other PCL events. One such event is the 100% fundraising event, 'Randy's Ride' which celebrates the life and legacy of Randy Gibson, a Gravel Worlds promoter and cyclist who was killed by a drunk driver in 2017." (https://www.gravelworlds.com/blog/pirate-cycling-league-celebrates-15-years-of-two-wheeled-adventures)

**Historical significance:** "Gravel Worlds had now become a staple of the gravel scene... this event and Barry-Roubaix are really the only gravel events which can trace an unbroken line from before 2010 to the present day. The Gravel Worlds event is one of those iconic American inventions that not only represents 'gravel' in perhaps its truest form today, but is an event with a historical importance that not many current events can even hope to touch." (https://g-tedproductions.blogspot.com/2023/08/gravel-history-with-guitar-ted-good.html)

**Original format:** "In keeping with PCL tradition and mission statement, there will be no entry fee. Riders will be required to purchase Nebraska Lottery Powerball tickets as proof of reaching a checkpoint (date and time are indicated on the ticket)." From the 2008 original event.
