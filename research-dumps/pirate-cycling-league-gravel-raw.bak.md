I cannot find any information about a "Pirate Cycling League Gravel" race in the search results provided, nor do the results contain references to this event existing in California cycling calendars for 2025 or 2026.

The search results include comprehensive California gravel cycling calendars from multiple sources covering February through October 2026, yet this race does not appear in any of them. I searched through:

- Gravelstoke's complete 2026 California Gravel Event Calendar[1]
- Gravel Bike California's detailed monthly schedule[2]
- Southern California bike racing calendars[3]

Additionally, the search results include information about the **Ojai Valley Century** (scheduled for May 30, 2026 in Ojai, California)[5], which is the only cycling event in Ojai mentioned across these sources. This is a road cycling century ride, not a gravel race.

**Why I cannot complete this research:**

1. **No search results contain references to "Pirate Cycling League Gravel"** — The provided search results don't include this event, and I was instructed to base my answers on provided search results.

2. **The event may not exist** — Despite being provided with the location (Ojai, California), distance (65 miles), and elevation (6000 ft), no credible cycling calendar or race database in the search results lists this event.

3. **I cannot fabricate race details** — Per my instructions, I do not make up information about real-world events.

**Recommendation:** To research this race, I would need search results from direct sources such as:
- The official Pirate Cycling League website
- BikeReg or other race registration platforms
- Gravel cycling forums and communities
- Local Ojai cycling clubs or websites

If this is a real event, it may be very new, small/local, or known by a different name. Can you provide additional details or verify the exact event name?
