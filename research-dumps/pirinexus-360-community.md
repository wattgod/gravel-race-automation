# PIRINEXUS 360 — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Tom Owen [ELITE]:** "After one night sleeping on the ground, you look brain-fried, cognitively disjointed. While coffee might drive away the mental fog of tiredness, it does nothing for your appearance. Drink all the flat whites you like, you still look like a hobo. By day two you will smell like one too, at which point you have to start choosing dinner options based on availability of outdoor seating." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-culture/bikepacking-the-pirinexus-an-eye-opening-ride-through-catalunya/)

**Tom Owen [ELITE]:** "I rode the Pirinexus, or my version of it, on a steel frame Decathlon road bike from the 1990s... Running 25c tyres, mismatched wheels and a metal fork with an outrageous rake to it, it proved anything but nimble; it felt practically lethal on rocky descents." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-culture/bikepacking-the-pirinexus-an-eye-opening-ride-through-catalunya/)

**Tom Owen [ELITE]:** "My water bottles froze both nights. On the first night my breakfast banana also froze. On the second night I slept with my snacks inside my sleeping bag." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-culture/bikepacking-the-pirinexus-an-eye-opening-ride-through-catalunya/)

**The Raw Stories team [UNKNOWN]:** "50 kilometers of hard climbing (23 km of them by gravel) were waiting for us, from Ceret (Km 180) until the top of Col d'Ares (Km 230). It was really hard and a huge nightmare for a lot of participants, and some of them left the race on that point." (http://www.therawstories.com/the-pirinexus-360/)

**The Raw Stories team [UNKNOWN]:** "Col d'Ares was our main goal in our minds. If we achieved it, we knew that we could finish the race on time." (http://www.therawstories.com/the-pirinexus-360/)

**The Raw Stories team [UNKNOWN]:** "We did the latest 49 km during the night, riding really fast thru a single-track direction Girona and trying to earn some minutes." (http://www.therawstories.com/the-pirinexus-360/)

**Dan de Rosilles [UNKNOWN]:** "I have mounted, from an old Raleigh frame modified in the Caminade workshop in Ille-sur-Têt, a very comfortable bike... The Pirinexus 360 Challenge is the dream opportunity to validate the relevance of this assembly and prove that the fixed gear is also suitable for long off-road routes." (https://bike-cafe.fr/2017/06/the-pirinexus-360-challenge-catalunya-version-gravel/) [Note: Dan completed the event on a fixed-gear bike with a flip-flop hub]

**Timo Rokitta [COMPETITIVE]:** "After 334 kilometers and almost 3,300 meters of climbing, the fastest gravel rider only needed 12:28 hours. The last finishers arrived just before 1.a.m. to the finish after almost 19 hours of riding." (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-the-pirinexus-challenge)

**Timo Rokitta [COMPETITIVE]:** "On a gravel 'Via Verde' (a former railway converted into a cycle path) with many deep puddles and wet feet we climbed gently to our first destination, Olot." (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-the-pirinexus-challenge)

**Timo Rokitta [COMPETITIVE]:** "An ice-cold wind was blowing and the view was fantastic [at Col d'Ares]. On the very long descent it slowly got warmer and warmer." (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-the-pirinexus-challenge)

**Timo Rokitta [COMPETITIVE]:** "After the descent, the wind picked up and of course it came from the front. It was now over fast gravel slopes in the direction of the sea." (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-the-pirinexus-challenge)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Bike Choice - Eat Sleep Cycle [UNKNOWN]:** "The key consideration when choosing a great bike for the Pirinexus is understanding what type of terrain will be encountered. The Pirinexus starts and finishes on Via Verde, a smooth gravel custom-built bike path... The next major climb of the route, the Col de Ares, is also a road climb – painfully slow on a mountain bike." (https://www.eatsleepcycle.com/bikepacking-the-pirinexus/)

**Bike Choice - Eat Sleep Cycle [UNKNOWN]:** "After climbing a quiet lane to reach the border the road quite simply disappears and a fairly technical, awesome stretch of gravel unfolds. Here a mountain bike or an adventure gravel bike would make this section loads of fun. Anyone on tyres under 40c would be on foot. There is, of course, an unofficial alternative route on the road – the perfect choice for anyone lacking confidence with their bike skills or riding a road bike." (https://www.eatsleepcycle.com/bikepacking-the-pirinexus/)

**Bike Recommendations - Eat Sleep Cycle [UNKNOWN]:**
- "Ridley Kanzo Adventure – perhaps the perfect choice for the Pirinexus. A lightweight carbon frame with tyre clearance up to 42c. Make sure your gear ratio is up to the steeper sections of the route."
- "Reilly Gradient – a great choice and better on the technical sections than the Kanzo. This is a bike which absorbs the bumps of the road for optimum ride comfort."
- "Ridley Ignite MTB – an awesome lightweight hardtail. You'll sacrifice speed on the paved road sections but you'll fly along the technical stuff."
(https://www.eatsleepcycle.com/bikepacking-the-pirinexus/)

**Official Event Guidance [UNKNOWN]:** "For the test all types of bikes are admitted, although the most recommended are the gravel or cyclocross bicycles. It can also be done with a road bicycle with 25 or 28-inch tires, or a 29-inch mountain bike with flat tires." (https://www.viesverdes.cat/en/noticies_actualitat/arriba-la-5a-edicio-de-la-pirinexus-360-challenge/)

**Bikepacking Bags - Eat Sleep Cycle [UNKNOWN]:** "Ortlieb are the staple of cycling luggage. They offer a full-range of bikepacking gear as well as traditional panniers. Their bags are fully waterproof & their oversized saddle bags even fit well on small frames. The straps are all velcro & the bags are really simple to fit... Arkel are also known for great quality bags. Their saddle bag comes with a rack – great for added stability and something you'll appreciate when flying downhill around corners. However, the rack is fairly tricky to fit and it does not work with small frames – the bag is too deep and rubs on the rear tyre." (https://www.eatsleepcycle.com/bikepacking-the-pirinexus/)

## Weather Experienced

**2022 Edition - Timo Rokitta [COMPETITIVE]:** "The night before the event there was heavy rain and some thunderstorms. The starting shot was fired at 6 a.m. sharp and the riders set off in the dark. On a gravel 'Via Verde' with many deep puddles and wet feet..." (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-the-pirinexus-challenge)

**2022 Edition - Timo Rokitta [COMPETITIVE]:** "The mountains were shrouded in fog in the early morning light... An ice-cold wind was blowing [at the French border]. On the very long descent it slowly got warmer and warmer." (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-the-pirinexus-challenge)

**Tom Owen's Bikepacking Trip [ELITE]:** "My water bottles froze both nights. On the first night my breakfast banana also froze." [Early spring conditions] (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-culture/bikepacking-the-pirinexus-an-eye-opening-ride-through-catalunya/)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Via Verde Sections [UNKNOWN]:** "The Pirinexus starts and finishes on Via Verde, a smooth gravel custom-built bike path that stretches from the Costa Brava to Olot in the foothills of the Pyrenees." (https://www.eatsleepcycle.com/bikepacking-the-pirinexus/)

**Col d'Ares Climb:** "50 kilometers of hard climbing (23 km of them by gravel) were waiting for us, from Ceret (Km 180) until the top of Col d'Ares (Km 230)." [UNKNOWN] (http://www.therawstories.com/the-pirinexus-360/)

**Border Crossing Technical Section [UNKNOWN]:** "After climbing a quiet lane to reach the border the road quite simply disappears and a fairly technical, awesome stretch of gravel unfolds. Here a mountain bike or an adventure gravel bike would make this section loads of fun. Anyone on tyres under 40c would be on foot." (https://www.eatsleepcycle.com/bikepacking-the-pirinexus/)

**Post-France Descent [COMPETITIVE]:** "The second crossing of the Pyrenees in the direction of Spain followed on a small paved path that was full of loose gravel. Once at the top, we went on a bumpy trail to the second feed station in La Jonquera." (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-the-pirinexus-challenge)

**Night Riding [UNKNOWN]:** "We did the latest 49 km during the night, riding really fast thru a single-track direction Girona." (http://www.therawstories.com/the-pirinexus-360/)

**Overall Character [UNKNOWN]:** "The route passes through all types of terrain, tarmac roads, many gravel tracks and some urban zones." (https://www.viesverdes.cat/en/noticies_actualitat/the-pirinexus-360-challenge-and-half-p360-gravel/)

**Surface Conditions [UNKNOWN]:** "After La Jonquera the route alternates between quiet lanes and gravel farm tracks – perfect to enjoy on any type of gravel bike." (https://www.eatsleepcycle.com/bikepacking-the-pirinexus/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Pacing Strategy - The Raw Stories Team [UNKNOWN]:** "The bad point was that, apart from the main race, there was a half race modality with 145 km and we started all together. That means that the first phase of the race was really fast if you wanted to go in front of the peloton. After the first checkpoint, we took the decision to be more conservative than faster and save energies for the harder part of the route." (http://www.therawstories.com/the-pirinexus-360/)

**Key Checkpoint - La Jonquera [UNKNOWN]:** "We arrived at La Jonquera, the third checkpoint, with 150 km in our legs. We refill our body with a bit of pasta, fruit, and liquids, and we started the first serious climb, crossing to France." (http://www.therawstories.com/the-pirinexus-360/)

**Mental Goal Setting [UNKNOWN]:** "Col d'Ares was our main goal in our minds. If we achieved it, we knew that we could finish the race on time." (http://www.therawstories.com/the-pirinexus-360/)

**Time Management [UNKNOWN]:** "When you're bikepacking, you need to find a spot to sleep and don't want to do that in the dark, which in early spring in Spain means you need to know where you're going to sleep by 6pm. Usually, I try to be in position, effectively 'in bed' about half an hour after the sun has gone down." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-culture/bikepacking-the-pirinexus-an-eye-opening-ride-through-catalunya/)

**Feed Station Info [COMPETITIVE]:** "Here there was pasta and coke for battered gravel bikers." [At La Jonquera feed station] (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-the-pirinexus-challenge)

**Finish Time Spread [COMPETITIVE]:** "After 334 kilometers and almost 3,300 meters of climbing, the fastest gravel rider only needed 12:28 hours. The last finishers arrived just before 1.a.m. to the finish after almost 19 hours of riding." (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-the-pirinexus-challenge)

**Time Limit:** "Participants have 20 hours to make an itinerary" / "Participants have until midnight to complete" [UNKNOWN] (http://www.therawstories.com/the-pirinexus-360/ and https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-the-pirinexus-challenge)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Col d'Ares as Critical Point [UNKNOWN]:** "50 kilometers of hard climbing (23 km of them by gravel) were waiting for us, from Ceret (Km 180) until the top of Col d'Ares (Km 230). It was really hard and a huge nightmare for a lot of participants, and some of them left the race on that point." (http://www.therawstories.com/the-pirinexus-360/)

**Technical Section Risk [UNKNOWN]:** "After climbing a quiet lane to reach the border the road quite simply disappears and a fairly technical, awesome stretch of gravel unfolds... Anyone on tyres under 40c would be on foot." [Implication: wrong equipment can force walking] (https://www.eatsleepcycle.com/bikepacking-the-pirinexus/)

**Sleep Deprivation [UNKNOWN]:** "We only could sleep 4 hours the night before the race but we tried to be ready on time for start line and keep our mind aware for the first part of the ride." (http://www.therawstories.com/the-pirinexus-360/)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Event Philosophy [UNKNOWN]:** "Although the event is timed and is fiercely competitive among the front runners, the organisers say that 'for us all the cyclists are equally as important as the first one.'" (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-the-pirinexus-challenge)

**Pro Participation [COMPETITIVE]:** "This year the peloton included three professional cyclists - Hayley Simmonds from CAMS-Basso and Ana Dillana & Carlos Verona from Movistar." [2022 edition] (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-the-pirinexus-challenge)

**Field Size [COMPETITIVE]:** "Almost 100 starters were at the start in Girona on September 24th [2022]." (https://gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-the-pirinexus-challenge)

**Event Context:** "The event is held during the three days of the Sea Otter Europe salon" in Girona. (https://www.viesverdes.cat/en/noticies_actualitat/arriba-la-5a-edicio-de-la-pirinexus-360-challenge/)

**Local Vibe - Tom Owen [ELITE]:** "Spain has a wilder sensibility, a more permissive attitude. 'He's a moron for sleeping out in close-to-zero conditions,' goes the logic, 'but he's only hurting himself.'" [Describing local police encounter while wild camping] (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-culture/bikepacking-the-pirinexus-an-eye-opening-ride-through-catalunya/)

**Political Context - Tom Owen [ELITE]:** "Catalunya is struggling for identity. It is a place torn apart by divisions, by perceptions of being unjustly controlled and unfairly treated by a larger outside entity... There didn't appear to be a single building unfestooned with pro-independence banners or the twisted yellow ribbon that has become the independence movement's emblem." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-culture/bikepacking-the-pirinexus-an-eye-opening-ride-through-catalunya/)

**Regional Beauty:** "Catalunya is a fundamentally beautiful place, capable of prosperity and peace... gorgeous monasteries and tumbledown churches that would draw busloads of tourists were they in England, remain totally unvisited. Unloved, not because they are not beautiful, but because there are so commonplace." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-culture/bikepacking-the-pirinexus-an-eye-opening-ride-through-catalunya/)

**Organizer Background:** "Jordi Cantal, the creator of 'The Pirinexus 360 Challenge'... himself cyclist and lover of his region, wishes to convince, thanks to this event, more and more athletes to embrace the practice of gravel." (https://bike-cafe.fr/2017/06/the-pirinexus-360-challenge-catalunya-version-gravel/)
