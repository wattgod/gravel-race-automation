## 2. RACE HISTORY & FOUNDING

### Origin Story

**Founder:** Jordi Cantal (born 1971, Santa Coloma de Farners - 20km south of Girona)

**The Genesis (Summer 2014):**
> "When Jordi Cantal began to travel the Pirinexus route of 340 km in summer 2014, he did not know that at the end, deep in the night, he would have created a new challenge that has already become a legend."

Cantal completed the route alone in 18 hours during that first ride, and this personal milestone evolved into an organized event-challenge.

### Jordi Cantal Background
- **2008:** Started working as cycling guide for Bikecat (pioneering Girona cycling company)
- **2010:** Began organizing gravel tours with friend Michael Barry (ex-professional cyclist) - notably before "gravel" was even a mainstream term
- **2011:** Entered cycling world through professional road cycling connections
- **2014:** Created the Pirinexus 360 Challenge concept
- **2015:** Officially designed and directed "The Pirinexus Challenge 360" as a circular, trans-border endurance race
- **2017:** Began designing and directing gravel events for Sea Otter Europe festival
- **2019:** Founded the Girona Gravel Cycling Club

### Event Evolution
- **7 editions** held to date
- Now part of the Gran Fondo World Tour Gravel Series
- Part of UCI Gravel World Series at Sea Otter Europe
- Considered "one of the most authentic, beautiful, tough and prestigious gravel races in Europe"

### Bikepacking Heritage
The Pirinexus route itself predates the race - it was developed as a cycling-tourism route connecting the greenways (Vias Verdes) of the Girona region. The challenge format taps into the global bikepacking/ultra-endurance movement, combining:
- Self-supported riding ethos
- Checkpoint-based validation (route book stamps)
- Non-competitive "personal achievement" philosophy alongside racing
- The romance of finishing under the stars

## 3. TERRAIN & COURSE

### Route Overview

The Pirinexus is a 340-kilometer mixed-terrain loop that connects Spanish Catalunya with the southeast of France. The route starts and finishes in Girona and is about half paved, using gravel roads, greenways, and quiet backroads to string it all together.

### Geographic Zones Crossed

### Racing Conditions Analysis

**Positives:**
- September is one of the **best months for cycling** in Girona
- Comfortable temperatures (not summer heat)
- Good sunshine probability
- Bike rental fleets "completely sold out" in September (peak cycling season)

**Challenges:**

- Night riding portion (after sundown ~9:23 PM) will be cool
- Col d'Ares summit at 1,500m significantly cooler than valley

### Pyrenees-Specific Weather

- Climate variable by altitude and orientation
- Spanish (south-facing) side in rain shadow = drier, sunnier
- Thunderstorms can develop late in day during summer
- No "typical" weather pattern in shoulder seasons
- Winds generally blow from humid Atlantic north

### Clothing Recommendations

**Daytime:**

## 5. FORUM INSIGHTS

### Bike Selection Debates

**The Consensus:**
> "All bikes are allowed, although probably the most appropriate are gravel or cyclo-cross bikes."

**The Reality:**
- Via Verde sections: Smooth enough for road bikes
- Col d'Ares: Road climb - "painfully slow on a mountain bike"
- Technical border sections: "Impassable on anything but front-suspension MTB" for some descents

**Recommended Builds:**
- Canyon Grail, Specialized Diverge mentioned as ideal
- 40mm+ tires essential for technical sections
- "Anyone on tyres under 40c would be on foot"
- Road bikes with 28mm tires allowed but challenging
- MTB 29er with slicks works but slow on climbs

### Wild Camping Intel

> "There's no lack of camping sites in this corner of Spain, and Catalonia is one of the few regions in Spain where wild camping is not prohibited."

This is relevant for multi-day bikepacking attempts rather than race format.

### Coastal Warning

> "Stay clear of the coast in summer due to mass tourism."

September race timing helps avoid peak tourist crowds.

### Race Experience Reports

**Night Riding Reality:**
> "The final 49 km were done during the night, riding really fast through single-track toward Girona. Riders were tired but happy and excited to be close to completing the challenge."

**Sleep Deprivation:**
> "Participants could only sleep 4 hours the night before the race."

**Race Start Dynamics:**
> "There was also a half race modality with 145 km, and both started together, making the first phase of the race very fast if riders wanted to stay at the front of the peloton. After the first checkpoint, some riders chose to be more conservative and save energy for the harder parts."

**The Col d'Ares Mental Game:**
> "Col d'Ares was their main goal in their minds - if they achieved it, they knew they could finish the race on time."

### Pacing Strategy

The "ultimate challenge" within the challenge:
- Start: 6:13 AM
- Sundown: ~9:23 PM
- **Target: Finish in 15h 10m to avoid ANY night riding**
- Standard target: Finish before midnight (18h time limit)

Most riders will ride the final 2-3 hours in darkness.

### GPX Availability

- Official GPX from thepirinexuschallenge.com
- Komoot collections available
- biroto.eu provides high-detail GPX (22 track points per km)
- Freewheeling France offers downloads
- Wikiloc tracks from past editions

## 6. BLACK PILL - Honest Truths About This Ultra-Distance Challenge

### The Distance Reality
340 km in a single push. This is not a "long ride" - it's an ultra-endurance event requiring months of specific preparation.

### The Elevation Truth
3,000-3,400m of climbing. The race profile isn't about one big climb - it's relentless undulation with two significant mountain passes.

### The Technical Sections
- **Border crossing descent:** "Road quite simply disappears"
- Gravel so rough that riders under 40mm tires will walk
- Some sections genuinely require MTB handling skills
- The race description undersells the technical difficulty

### The Col d'Ares Crucible
> "It was really hard and a huge nightmare for a lot of participants, and some of them left the race on that point."

This climb has historically been the DNF point. Coming at roughly the halfway mark, after already significant climbing, it breaks riders mentally and physically.

### The Time Pressure
- 18-hour limit sounds generous for 340km
- Reality: 55% gravel, 3,400m climbing, technical sections
- Average speed needed: ~19 km/h INCLUDING all stops
- The "ultimate challenge" (daylight finish): requires ~22+ km/h average
- Night riding is not optional for most finishers

### The Sleep Deprivation Factor
- Race starts at dawn (~6:13 AM)
- Festival environment night before = poor sleep
- 12-18 hours of physical exertion
- Decision-making deteriorates after hour 12-14
- Navigation errors increase in darkness

### The September Weather Gamble
- 24% daily rain chance
- Mountain weather unpredictable
- Cold, wet descent from Col d'Ares in rain = hypothermia risk
- Finishing in darkness adds cold exposure

### The Self-Support Reality
- Checkpoint-based, not fully supported
- Must carry enough nutrition between aid stations
- Mechanical issues = your problem
- Navigation errors = your time loss

### The Record Perspective
- Course record: 12 hours
- That's an average of 28.3 km/h INCLUDING gravel, climbing, technical sections
- Elite ultra-endurance athletes only
- Mere mortals should plan for 14-17 hours

### Who Should NOT Do This Race
- First-time ultra-distance riders (do something shorter first)
- Riders without night riding experience
- Those uncomfortable on rough gravel/technical terrain
- Anyone unable to complete 250km+ training rides
- Riders without proper bike setup (40mm+ tires, reliable lights, navigation)

### Who This Race IS For
- Experienced ultra-endurance cyclists
- Gravel riders seeking a landmark European challenge
- Cyclists with strong climbing legs
- Those who thrive on type-2 fun
- Riders who want a prestigious finisher badge

## 8. SUGGESTED GRAVEL GOD RATINGS

### Rating Scale: 1-5 (1 = Easiest/Lowest, 5 = Hardest/Highest)

| Category | Rating | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| **Overall Difficulty** | 4.5/5 | 340km, 3,400m climbing, technical gravel, night riding, 18h limit |
| **Technical Terrain** | 3.5/5 | 55% gravel with some genuinely rough sections; mostly rideable but border descent requires skill |
| **Climbing Challenge** | 4/5 | Two significant passes plus constant undulation; Col d'Ares is the crucible |
| **Navigation Complexity** | 2.5/5 | Well-marked route, GPX available, checkpoint system; mainly follow the track |
| **Scenic Beauty** | 5/5 | Volcanic zones, Pyrenean passes, medieval villages, Costa Brava coast, vineyards - exceptional variety |
| **Prestige/Clout** | 4/5 | Part of UCI Gravel World Series, Sea Otter Europe, respected European ultra event |
| **Accessibility** | 3.5/5 | Barcelona/Girona airports reasonable; Girona is cycling mecca with good infrastructure |
| **Value for Money** | 4/5 | Entry includes festival access, food stations, finisher award; reasonable for ultra event |
| **Type-2 Fun Factor** | 5/5 | Night riding, Col d'Ares suffering, finishing in darkness - maximum type-2 |
| **Finish Rate Estimate** | ~70-80% | Many DNF at Col d'Ares; time limit pressure adds to attrition |

### Summary Assessment

**Best For:**
- Experienced ultra-gravel riders seeking European adventure
- Cyclists who want scenic variety (volcano, mountain, coast, medieval) in one epic day
- Those building toward bigger events (good stepping stone)
- Sea Otter Europe festival attendees wanting the ultimate challenge

**Think Twice If:**
- First ultra-distance event
- Uncomfortable with technical gravel or night riding
- Unable to train for 300km+ rides
- Seeking pure race competition (it's more personal challenge format)

### Comparison Context

| Event | Distance | Elevation | Time Limit | Difficulty |
|-------|----------|-----------|------------|------------|
| **Pirinexus 360** | 340km | 3,400m | 18h | Hard |
| Dirty Reiver 200 | 200km | 3,000m | No limit | Medium |
| Unbound 200 | 322km | 3,400m | No limit | Hard |
| Badlands (Spain) | 750km | 15,000m | 5 days | Extreme |
| Transpyrenees | 1,124km | 28,000m | Self-paced | Extreme |

The Pirinexus 360 sits in the "hard single-day ultra" category - easier than multi-day events but demanding more than typical one-day gravel races due to distance, terrain, and time constraints.
