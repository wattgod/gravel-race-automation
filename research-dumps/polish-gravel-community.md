## Weather Experienced

**UCI Gravel Adventure Poland 2025:** Race "started in dry conditions" but "quickly changed. Dense pea-soup fog enveloped the mountainous course as wind whipped through the dense forest and rain turned the gravel route into a series of mud puddles." 350 riders battled these conditions on the 128km course. (https://granfondodailynews.com/2025/06/08/uci-gravel-adventure-poland-results-350-hardcore-riders-battle-mother-nature/)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Poland Gravel Race route specifics:** "The route will take you through the Przemyśl foothills, Bieszczady, Western Beskids, Pieniny, and Tatras." The race features "awe-inspiring gravel roads, overnight bivouac under open skies or lodging in rustic mountain chalets." Start includes "first climb from Przemyśl old town to Tatar Mound" which is described as "a foreshadowing of the challenges that await." (https://pgr.kolo-ultra.pl/en/)

**UCI Gravel Adventure Poland course:** 128km mountainous route described as "extremely fast rally" with "roads are not necessarily extremely wide" and "soft and sandy places where the second pass conditions can create some surprises." [ELITE] Sébastien Ogier noted: "It was a rally I generally enjoyed in the past...It's an extremely fast rally, even though the roads are not necessarily extremely wide, but there are also these soft and sandy places where the second pass conditions can create some surprises."
