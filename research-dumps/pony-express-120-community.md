# PONY EXPRESS 120 — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Sue Hageman [UNKNOWN]:** "My brain and body are tired today! Pony Express 120 Gravel Dash was my longest and hardest event this year! Weather was perfect. ❤️❤️ ... I did the 65 miler with 3793 feet of elevation. The first third and last third were definitely the toughest. Hills were steeper but not hill after hill like Gravel Worlds. We actually had several 'flat' sections. I drank and ate very well. First time ever I had to go to bathroom 20-30 miles in. Mentally I did surprisingly well. Even though the last 15 miles were rough. Sometimes I wanted to cry when I saw a hill!!! No crying happened!!!" (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/sues-story-pony-express-120-gravel-dash)

**CrossTrail (bikepacker) [UNKNOWN]:** "The day heats up and the dirt roads get rougher. By the time I reach the second checkpoint at mile 43, I'm ready for a break. I plop down in the air conditioned Palmer Cafe for a cheeseburger, fries, and coke. No, that's not racing food. That's bikepacking food. I lounge there for more than an hour... The short cut blasts 14 miles straight east on moderately thick county gravel right through a relentless progression of rolling hills in the shadeless 95 degree heat. It's reminiscent of Gravel Worlds with its never-ending waves of hills across a vast sea of gravel." (https://blackhillsbackbone.blogspot.com/2022/09/2022-pony-express-120-bikepack.html)

**CrossTrail (Day 2 rain experience) [UNKNOWN]:** "At the first hint of daylight, the camp stirs to life under threatening skies and a steady northerly wind. With heavy rain forecast, Race Director Mark Hoffman sends us on the 'wet' route, an alternative route home that replaces miles of dirt roads with good gravel and pavement. Sure enough, at 7:00 am with our first pedal stroke from camp, the first rain drops fall. With only 28 miles to ride back to Marysville, the 50-some degree rain is not a big deal, but the rain does not stop all morning." (https://blackhillsbackbone.blogspot.com/2022/09/2022-pony-express-120-bikepack.html)

**CrossTrail (on camp experience) [UNKNOWN]:** "Jon Naaf marks our campsite with a cozy oasis of chairs and coolers wedged into the camper's sliver of shade. He enthusiastically hails riders as they trickle in, first from the short cut and then from the main route. All are hot, tired, and grateful for relief. In addition to a hearty greeting, Jon offers cold drinks and snacks, cooks gourmet burgers, and gathers all to share a peaceful evening." (https://blackhillsbackbone.blogspot.com/2022/09/2022-pony-express-120-bikepack.html)

**Jamie and Richard (Boy Scout dads with sons Noah and Charles) [UNKNOWN]:** Described as "experienced hikers and campers, but first time bikepackers. Their excited, joyful tales of their day long ride to camp bring smiles and laughter all around." (https://blackhillsbackbone.blogspot.com/2022/09/2022-pony-express-120-bikepack.html)

**Jeff and Carter (triathlete father and teenage son) [UNKNOWN]:** "Carter looks absolutely shelled when arriving at camp, slumps over in a chair, and moves not a muscle for maybe an hour. Eventually, he revives. By morning, he's a colt busting out of the corral. Carter ultimately finishes second in the race home and is a living example of the recuperative powers of youthful exuberance. And sleep."

**Bikepacking Pacing [UNKNOWN - CrossTrail]:**
- At mile 43 checkpoint (Palmer Cafe): "I plop down in the air conditioned Palmer Cafe for a cheeseburger, fries, and coke. No, that's not racing food. That's bikepacking food.

- Decision point: "Do I continue on the 120 mile route for another 46 overheated, hilly, rough miles? Or do I ride an alternative route 16 miles straight to camp?" - Chose the shorter route to "enjoy several more hours hanging out with everyone at camp" (https://blackhillsbackbone.blogspot.com/2022/09/2022-pony-express-120-bikepack.html)

**Mental Strategy [UNKNOWN - Sue Hageman]:**
- "Mentally I did surprisingly well. Even though the last 15 miles were rough. Sometimes I wanted to cry when I saw a hill!!! No crying happened!!!" (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/sues-story-pony-express-120-gravel-dash)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Bike Equipment [UNKNOWN - Sue Hageman]:**

- Riders need to "carry their chosen sleep gear" for the overnight camp (https://blackhillsbackbone.blogspot.com/2022/09/2022-pony-express-120-bikepack.html)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Event Culture:**
- "Race Directors Renee and Mark Hoffman of Backroads Bicycles pull together a committed team and a legion of volunteers to create an energetic, festive event for everyone.

- "New friends connect. Old friends re-connect. All share experiences of the day, of days past, and of days to come. It's a bikepacker rendezvous." (https://blackhillsbackbone.blogspot.com/2022/09/2022-pony-express-120-bikepack.html)

**Post-Race:**
- "I see nothing but smiles and hear nothing but good cheer from all the bikepackers at the finish. A hot shower certainly helps, along with homemade pie and ice cream, other food and drinks, a Finisher's towel (appropriate), and my door prize (concentrated bike cleaner, again appropriate)." (https://blackhillsbackbone.blogspot.com/2022/09/2022-pony-express-120-bikepack.html)
