## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Whitney Allison [ELITE]:** "I was the only 'pro class' woman and there were 16 men in the same 'pro class' field with a separate start. The race kicks off with a 13-mile climb and although it started civilly; an e-bike rider joined our group from behind and blew the field apart, including me. I then rode the next ~92 miles almost entirely alone, passing dozens of age groupers and a handful of the men from my field... With newly and deeply graded roads, the times were slower this year and the higher elevation parts of the course were quite technical. I finished 5 hours and 37 minutes later, 7th in the 'pro class' if you were to combine genders." (https://slowguyonthefastride.com/whitney-allison-pony-xpress-160-from-the-saddle/)

**Whitney Allison [ELITE]:** "It was one of the more surreal rides, moving between being totally present, alive, and pushing the pace, and going into total robot automation mode, reflecting on mortality... We sat around with dehydration and altitude headaches, among our peers, catching up a bit and waiting for the lost checks to be rediscovered." (https://slowguyonthefastride.com/whitney-allison-pony-xpress-160-from-the-saddle/)

**Holly Geilman [ELITE]:** "Miles 41-50.1 were more focused but full of more mountain and desert views. Ok, let's get this done! When I passed the finish line the first time, another checkpoint, I kept running to complete the short out and back to finish the 50-mile distance... The dirt road from the turnaround to the finish was super soft like sand. I remember smelling and hearing the finish line food preppers." Finished Pony Express 50 in 8:06:59 as First Overall Finisher. (https://www.theaveragejoerunner.com/post/ponyexpress50)

**Steve (First-time 100-miler) [ELITE]:** "I was going faster than I should have. During the beginning of the 100 miler, I ran a sub 2 hour half marathon, then a 4 hour marathon, then a 9 hour 50 miler, I PR'ed my 50k, and then PR'ed my 100k. Apparently, my first 50 miles of the race were nearly as fast as the winner of the 50 mile race. Yeah, it was a fast start to a 100 miler for me." (https://saturdaymarathons.com/pony-express-100-miler-steves-first-100/)

**Steve [ELITE]:** "The miles in the 70s were the toughest for me. I started a long incline up to Dugway pass. I just didn't have it in me to run at this point. Everything started hurting. My feet, calves, back, hips, glutes, and quads all hurt. Every step hurt... I was so negative even though I tried to tell myself to be patient. There I was in a world of negativity and pain. But… I kept going." (https://saturdaymarathons.com/pony-express-100-miler-steves-first-100/)

**Steve [ELITE]:** "Josh kept pushing me, trying to get all the running he could out of me. I tried not to get too frustrated because I was in pain, and I knew Josh was trying to help me. He knew better than I did what I was capable of. He kept prodding just enough to get more out of me." (https://saturdaymarathoms.com/pony-express-100-miler-steves-first-100/)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Tire Selection [COMPETITIVE/ELITE]:** "Put away those heavy Dirty Kanza tires. These roads are fine gravel, so lighter tires can be run. Rain or snow makes the conditions fast." The course description notes: "A good tire combo is Schwalbe Thunder Burt rear and Rocket Ron or Racing Ralph front" for mountain bikers. (http://coloradogravelgrinderchampionship.com/pony-xpress/details)

**Bike Choice Considerations [COMPETITIVE]:** "Road bike, cross bike or mountain bike, which will be faster? You should be able to finish the course on a road bike with wide tires but it will be a challenge - with so little road sections there is little area to make time and you will be slow on most of the course. Cross bikes will do well on the climbs and straight flats. Keep in mind that the course has many twisty sections where mountain bikes tend to be faster. Mountain bikers who set up their bike with light tires should do very well on the descents and on the endless curvy areas." (http://coloradogravelgrinderchampionship.com/pony-xpress/details)

**Required Equipment [ALL LEVELS]:** "We recommend that all riders have a head and tail light (micro light acceptable), a helmet, and a GPS for navigation." Note: GPS is mandatory as "the course is isolated with limited markings." (http://coloradogravelgrinderchampionship.com/pony-xpress/details)

**Running Gear [ELITE - Ultra]:** Steve used a "Salomon Advanced Skin Backpack (12 set)" for his 100-mile run. Holly mentioned needing anti-chafing product reapplication at mile 50. (https://saturdaymarathons.com/pony-express-100-miler-steves-first-100/)

## Weather Experienced

**2022 Race (Cycling) [ELITE]:** Whitney Allison noted: "Colorado spring weather is inconsistent as hell. Beautiful sunny days mixed with plenty of wind advisories, and precipitation in the form of rain or spring snow storms are all on the menu." She also mentioned dealing with "dehydration and altitude headaches" post-race. (https://slowguyonthefastride.com/whitney-allison-pony-xpress-160-from-the-saddle/)

**General Course Conditions [UNKNOWN LEVEL]:** "Elevations range from 6,000 feet to 8,800 feet. Typical temps range from 50 degrees at start to 75 degrees mid day... In the unlikely possibility of snow, roads will be plowed and ready to race within 24 hours." (https://www.granfondoguide.com/Events/Index/5348/pony-xpress)

**Sun Exposure [ELITE - Ultra Running]:** Steve reported significant sun exposure: "There was also a lot of sun exposure along those long straight dirt roads. The temps were fine but the sun took its toll even on this desert runner from Las Vegas. The sun was almost always on my left side throughout the race so I ended up with a funny sunburn only on my left arm and only on the left side of my face/neck." (https://saturdaymarathons.com/pony-express-100-miler-steves-first-100/)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Opening Climb [ELITE]:** "The race kicks off with a 13-mile climb" - Whitney Allison notes this opening was disrupted by an e-bike rider who "blew the field apart." (https://slowguyonthefastride.com/whitney-allison-pony-xpress-160-from-the-saddle/)

**Technical Sections [ELITE]:** "With newly and deeply graded roads, the times were slower this year and the higher elevation parts of the course were quite technical." (https://slowguyonthefastride.com/whitney-allison-pony-xpress-160-from-the-saddle/)

**Course Composition [COMPETITIVE]:** "Consisting of rolling foothills, forests and open plains with stunning views of Fisher Peak. 70% of the course is in tree sheltered or canyon areas that are less susceptible to wind." The 160K course is "96% gravel county roads and 4% blacktop county roads." (http://coloradogravelgrinderchampionship.com/pony-xpress/details)

**Isolation Factor [ELITE]:** Whitney described riding "the next ~92 miles almost entirely alone, passing dozens of age groupers and a handful of the men from my field." The remote nature is emphasized: "Areas of the course are very remote with limited mobile phone reception." (https://slowguyonthefastride.com/whitney-allison-pony-xpress-160-from-the-saddle/)

**Surface Quality [COMPETITIVE]:** "These roads are fine gravel, so lighter tires can be run. Rain or snow makes the conditions fast." However, note the "twisty sections where mountain bikes tend to be faster." (http://coloradogravelgrinderchampionship.com/pony-xpress/details)

**Historic Elements [ELITE - Ultra Running]:** "There were some cool historical monuments along the way... Most of the race so far I was in second or third (to my knowledge). I yo-yoed back and forth with Melissa Soper." Course travels "through historic mining areas including the nationally recognized Ludlow Memorial." (https://saturdaymarathons.com/pony-express-100-miler-steves-first-100/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Fast Start Warning [ELITE - Ultra Running]:** Steve's pacing mistake: "I was going faster than I should have. During the beginning of the 100 miler, I ran a sub 2 hour half marathon, then a 4 hour marathon, then a 9 hour 50 miler... Yeah, it was a fast start to a 100 miler for me. About 50k into the race, my feet started to get a bit sore." This led to significant suffering in miles 70-80. (https://saturdaymarathons.com/pony-express-100-miler-steves-first-100/)

**Minimum Pace Requirements [ALL LEVELS - Cycling]:** "Riders must maintain a minimum speed of 10 MPH for the 160K race. For the 85K and 48K, riders must maintain a minimum speed of 8 MPH. Participants cycling slower will find feed stations closed and will receive a DNF." (http://coloradogravelgrinderchampionship.com/pony-xpress/details)

**Crew Strategy [ELITE - Ultra Running]:** Steve used a three-person crew rotation: "I had my friends RJ, Josh, and Paul to crew/pace me... I was glad when I would get to vehicle and see a crew member or two grabbing some rest." The format allows "ample access to aid" as "crew vehicle leapfrogs the runner along to give aid." (https://saturdaymarathons.com/pony-express-100-miler-steves-first-100/)

**Solo Riding Reality [ELITE]:** Whitney's experience: "I then rode the next ~92 miles almost entirely alone... It was one of the more surreal rides, moving between being totally present, alive, and pushing the pace, and going into total robot automation mode." (https://slowguyonthefastride.com/whitney-allison-pony-xpress-160-from-the-saddle/)

**Mental Game [ELITE - Ultra Running]:** Steve on the tough miles: "Should I quit? Is this worth it if I have to walk the rest of this thing? I had come so far though... There I was in a world of negativity and pain. But… I kept going." He notes his pacer Josh "kept pushing me, trying to get all the running he could out of me... He knew better than I did what I was capable of." (https://saturdaymarathons.com/pony-express-100-miler-steves-first-100/)

## Nutrition Strategy

**What Worked [ELITE - Ultra Running]:** Steve's rotation after gels upset his stomach: "I rotated through coconut water, fruit, and chia squeezes. That seemed to work well. When I got to Blackrock aid station at mile 68, I had some hot broth that really helped." He also used "ginger candy (with real ginger)" to settle his stomach. Initially used "plain water or water with Nuun. I was consuming gels and Mamma Chia squeezes." (https://saturdaymarathons.com/pony-express-100-miler-steves-first-100/)

**Aid Station Supplies [ALL LEVELS - Cycling]:** "Each fueling station will be stocked with 2.75 water bottles per rider per fueling station. Also, Hammer Nutrition will supply energy drinks and energy gels plus assorted energy/granola bars. Stations are located at miles 25, 50, and 75." (http://coloradogravelgrinderchampionship.com/pony-xpress/details)

**Stomach Issues [ELITE - Ultra Running]:** Steve experienced this early: "I quickly got sick of the gels. Literally, my stomach was getting upset." This forced him to abandon his planned nutrition strategy. (https://saturdaymarathons.com/pony-express-100-miler-steves-first-100/)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Blister Problems [ELITE - Ultra Running]:** Steve encountered another racer, Philip, at mile 33: "He was in a chair with his socks and shoes off... He said he was having blister problems... Last we saw of him, he didn't look like he was going anywhere anytime soon. Later, when we had cell service, we saw they hadn't recorded a check-in for him at Fish Springs. We theorized that his foot issues were bad enough to warrant a DNF." (https://saturdaymarathons.com/pony-express-100-miler-steves-first-100/)

**Minimum Speed Cutoffs [ALL LEVELS - Cycling]:** "Riders must maintain a minimum speed of 10 MPH for the 160K race. For the 85K and 48K, riders must maintain a minimum speed of 8 MPH. Participants cycling slower will find feed stations closed and will receive a DNF (did not finish)." The warning emphasizes: "It is very important for every participant to carefully monitor there own fitness, energy level, weather and navigation." (http://coloradogravelgrinderchampionship.com/pony-xpress/details)

**Sitting Too Long [ELITE - Ultra Running]:** Steve at mile 68: "Sitting in the chair at the aid station was a bad idea for me. I did NOT want to get up... Eventually, I forced myself back out on the course. I felt really great after the soup but the feeling didn't last long." (https://saturdaymarathons.com/pony-express-100-miler-steves-first-100/)

**Remote Course Reality [ALL LEVELS]:** "Areas of the course are very remote with limited mobile phone reception. It is very important for every participant to carefully monitor there own fitness, energy level, weather and navigation. This is one event where you cannot ride till your too tired and then pull over and expect someone to ferry you home." (http://coloradogravelgrinderchampionship.com/pony-xpress/details)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Small, Intimate Field [ELITE]:** Whitney noted: "Unfortunately the field was really, really tiny this year, with only "16 men in the same 'pro class' field with a separate start. I was the only 'pro class' woman." Contributing factors: "other Colorado racers at either Gravel Locos or Wild Horse Gravel." (https://slowguyonthefastride.com/whitney-allison-pony-xpress-160-from-the-saddle/)

**Family-Friendly Event [ELITE]:** Holly Geilman: "My husband and I loved the family aspect of the race" with crew involvement throughout. (https://www.theaveragejoerunner.com/post/ponyexpress50)

**Finish Line Food [ELITE]:** Holly reported: "Then I thoroughly enjoyed the chimichurri sauce, cheese, and chicken with all the sides were delicious. This race seriously had the best race finish line food I (and my crew) have ever eaten." (https://www.theaveragejoerunner.com/post/ponyexpress50)

**Community Support [ELITE - Ultra Running]:** Steve appreciated the ultra community: "Curtis' crew kindly took a few of my things to help me out along the way. I love stuff like that in the trail and ultra running community. People are willing to help each other out and want to see everyone succeed." (https://saturdaymarathons.com/pony-express-100-miler-steves-first-100/)

**Emotional Context [ELITE]:** Whitney's 2022 race coincided with Mo Wilson's murder: "It was shortly after we learned of Moriah 'Mo' Wilson's murder... It was one of the more surreal rides... thinking about Mo and how I wished I was down at Gravel Locos with a lot of the gravel community mourning... It was good to suffer and feel a lot that day in particular." (https://slowguyonthefastride.com/whitney-allison-pony-xpress-160-from-the-saddle/)

**Location Character [ELITE]:** Whitney and Zack on Trinidad: "This region was a part of Mexico until the Mexico Cession of 1848 and you feel that influence... Trinidad is known as the sex change capital of the world due to its history as a haven for sex reassignment surgery, has a bright and vibrant artist community, and has really embraced marijuana to help its economy. Needless to say, Trinidad feels like its own thing, full of life and character, and really great burritos." (https://slowguyonthefastride.com/whitney-allison-pony-xpress-160-from-the-saddle/)
