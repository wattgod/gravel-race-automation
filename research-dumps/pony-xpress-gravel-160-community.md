# PONY XPRESS GRAVEL 160 — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Tony Huston [ELITE]:** "Minus 34 was—drum roll please—the elevation reading on my GPS the day before I rode the PX 160. That's right, in the space of 24 hours, me and my buddy, Pat Smith, crawled out of a 34-foot-below-sea-level hole in Houston, yawned our up way to Trinidad, Colorado, and toed the starting line of a mountainous gravel race, facing a daunting apex of nearly 9000 feet. No acclimatization. No real idea of what to expect." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/pony-xpress-gravel-160-ride-report-by-tony-huston/)

**Tony Huston [ELITE]:** "After six miles of pavement, the course turned to gravelly goodness, winding into the piñon-speckled Sangre de Cristo foothills. Though we huffed and huffed, acclimating on the fly, we were thoroughly enjoying the fresh air and the soothing scenery." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/pony-xpress-gravel-160-ride-report-by-tony-huston/)

**Tony Huston [ELITE]:** "Then began the most formidable portion of the PX 160—the long, 20-mile climb up to 8,800 feet. We'd mentally circled this portion of the elevation profile earlier in the week, nervously assuring each other that we could do it. We knew we'd be slow—no point in denying that. The question was how slow? Would we have to stop every five minutes to allow our tiny, flatlander lungs to recover?" (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/pony-xpress-gravel-160-ride-report-by-tony-huston/)

**Phil Schweizer (Race Director) [UNKNOWN]:** When Phil and his son Jesse saw the last riders at the 75-mile aid station, Phil was "laughing and giving us bro-hugs, relieved beyond belief to lay eyes on us. Apparently only me, Pat, and two other riders were unaccounted for. Everyone else had finished or dropped. Phil and Jesse had been waiting at the aid station 'forever' and were just about to drive the course and start looking for us."

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Course Composition:** 96% gravel county roads and 4% blacktop county roads. Each distance has only 6 miles of blacktop. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/pony-xpress-gravel-160-ride-report-by-tony-huston/)

**Initial Climb:** The course starts with a 13-mile climb gaining 1,200 feet of elevation from Cokedale staging area at 6,300 feet. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/pony-xpress-gravel-160-ride-report-by-tony-huston/)

**Descent Section:** After the initial climb, riders get a 12-mile downhill "grin-maker chocked full of Colorado coolness" with views of weathered homesteads, mining ruins, windmills, and the snow-dusted Spanish Peaks. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/pony-xpress-gravel-160-ride-report-by-tony-huston/)

**Highway of Legends:** A smooth, fast descent section reaching "Marty McFly time travel speeds" around the 45-mile mark, featuring unusual volcanic formations radiating from the Spanish Peaks. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/pony-xpress-gravel-160-ride-report-by-tony-huston/)

**Remote Section:** The course parallels a "beautiful, babbling brook and more mining ruins" in the remotest part of the course, described as "true bearritory" with bear tracks spotted. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/pony-xpress-gravel-160-ride-report-by-tony-huston/)

**The Crux:** A 20-mile climb up to 8,800 feet is described as "brutal and never-ending," representing the most formidable portion of the race. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/pony-xpress-gravel-160-ride-report-by-tony-huston/)

**Final Section:** After cresting near 9,000 feet, riders get a "glorious, 30-mile descent to the finish line" with a few "annoying gotcha!-climbs." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/pony-xpress-gravel-160-ride-report-by-tony-huston/)

**Road Surface:** The course features "fine gravel roads, perfect for light tires." (http://coloradogravelgrinderchampionship.com/pony-xpress/details)

**Historic Features:** Course travels through historic mining areas including the nationally recognized Ludlow Memorial, with old jailhouses, collapsed homesteads, and disintegrated coke ovens visible along the route.

## Weather Experienced

**May 16, 2015 conditions:** Temperature was "a crisp 45 degrees" at the 6:30 AM staging, transitioning to warmer conditions requiring removal of undershirt and leg warmers during the ride. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/pony-xpress-gravel-160-ride-report-by-tony-huston/)

**Typical conditions:** "Typical temps from 45 degrees to 78 degrees" with "most of the course in calm sheltered areas providing protection from high winds." (https://coloradogravelgrinderchampionship.com/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Altitude Adjustment Strategy [ELITE]:** Tony Huston and Pat Smith came from -34 feet elevation in Houston to race at 6,000-9,000 feet with zero acclimatization. They accepted being "waaay in last place" and focused on "acclimating on the fly" rather than competing, huffing their way up the initial climbs. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/pony-xpress-gravel-160-ride-report-by-tony-huston/)

**Cut-off Requirements:** "Riders must maintain a minimum speed of 10 MPH for the 160K race. For the 85K and 48K, riders must maintain a minimum speed of 8 MPH. Participants cycling slower will find feed stations closed and will receive a DNF (did not finish)." (http://coloradogravelgrinderchampionship.com/pony-xpress/details)

**Navigation Strategy:** Race organizers emphasize: "All participants must have a GPS, as the course is isolated with limited markings." They recommend "a combination of using a GPS, riding with your head up, having a handlebar mounted map, and following the limited course marking arrows should be sufficient for successful navigation. If in doubt, riding the course in advance." (http://coloradogravelgrinderchampionship.com/pony-xpress/details)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Navigation Failures:** One 160-mile rider in the 2015 race got off-course multiple times despite having a Garmin GPS. Tony Huston encountered this rider (dubbed "Magellan") THREE separate times heading the wrong direction, ultimately accumulating an "81-mile penalty" before accepting a DNF. The rider's GPS was "apparently steering him wrong, and he'd not been paying attention to the course markers." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/pony-xpress-gravel-160-ride-report-by-tony-huston/)

**Altitude Challenges:** Houston-based riders found the elevation particularly challenging, questioning if they'd "have to stop every five minutes to allow our tiny, flatlander lungs to recover" and whether they'd "labor so long that we'd be swallowed up by the darkness." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/pony-xpress-gravel-160-ride-report-by-tony-huston/)

**Remote Course Conditions:** "Areas of the course are very remote with limited mobile phone reception. It will be very important that all riders monitor there energy levels, weather conditions and navigational tools." The race directors warn: "This is one event where you cannot ride till your too tired and then pull over and expect someone to ferry you home." (http://coloradogravelgrinderchampionship.com/pony-xpress/details)

**Cut-off Speed:** Feed stations close for riders not maintaining minimum pace, forcing a DNF for slower riders. (http://coloradogravelgrinderchampionship.com/pony-xpress/details)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Small Field Size:** In 2015 (the race's second year), there were approximately 15 cyclists at the 6:30 AM staging area for all distances combined. Participant info was marked as "private" on the registration website. Tony Huston noted: "I'm betting this thing gets bigger over the next several years." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/pony-xpress-gravel-160-ride-report-by-tony-huston/)

**Staging Area:** The start in Cokedale featured "a single white tent, a Port-a-Potty on a mini trailer, and about 15 cyclists, give or take." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/pony-xpress-gravel-160-ride-report-by-tony-huston/)

**Support Staff:** Race organizer Phil and his son Jesse manned aid stations personally, showing genuine concern for riders' safety. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/pony-xpress-gravel-160-ride-report-by-tony-huston/)

**Racing Philosophy:** The event embraces the historical theme: "Come discover the challenges Pony Express riders faced in the 1860s. These earliest American racers sped across remote, desolate regions of America. They had to combine speed, endurance, and mental toughness just to stay alive. While at their physical limits, they had to keep a clear mind, navigate the land, read the weather, and manage their food supply." (https://coloradogravelgrinderchampionship.com/)

**2026 Pause:** The race is "Paused for 2026, see you May 2027." (https://coloradogravelgrinderchampionship.com/)

**2027 Course Changes:** Instead of the "iconic 160K/100 mile loop," the long race will be 2 laps of the 85K/50 mile course. A new 50K/30 mile distance is being added "for those riders who just want to dip their toe into the gravel experience." Single speed class added for 85K/50 mile distance.
