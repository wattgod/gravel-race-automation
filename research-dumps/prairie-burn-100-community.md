# PRAIRIE BURN 100 — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Critical Error: Wrong Event Content

All 17 sources provided are about **prairie dog hunting** (varmint shooting with rifles), NOT about the Prairie Burn 100 gravel cycling race. The sources discuss topics like:

- Caliber selection for shooting prairie dogs (.223, .204 Ruger, 22-250, etc.)
- Scope recommendations for long-range varmint hunting
- Prairie dog hunting outfitters in Texas, South Dakota, Wyoming
- Hunting tactics and ammunition for pest control

However, I did find **6 legitimate sources** about the actual Prairie Burn 100 gravel bike event mixed in the URLs:

## Event Overview (From Official Sources)

**Prairie Burn 100 Official Website:** The event is held annually on the second Saturday of June in Grinnell, Iowa. The 2026 edition is scheduled for **June 6, 2026**. Routes include 25km, 50km, and 100km gravel rides, plus a 5K/3K Fun Run. The event benefits Imagine Grinnell, a local non-profit. (https://www.prairieburn100.com/)

**Travel Iowa [UNKNOWN]:** "The 2024 gravel ride event offered cyclists new 25, 50 and 100 mile routes and a race challenge for the 100 mile riders. All riders were invited to test their skills in the Burner Challenge segment dash for cash on each of the loops." (https://www.traveliowa.com/calendar/prairie-burn-100-gravel-bike-ride-and-5k-fun-run/1653598/)

**Note:** There is confusion in the sources between kilometer and mile distances. The official 2026 site lists "25, 50 and 100 kilometers" while Travel Iowa references "25, 50 and 100 mile routes" for 2024. This represents either a course change or inconsistent reporting.

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Laura Ferguson '90 [UNKNOWN]:** "It's community building, but it's also getting people out together, both in an activity and in supporting commerce." Ferguson describes the weekly Tuesday Prairie Burners training rides where cyclists meet at 5:30 PM at Bikes to You shop, ride about 25 miles over 2.5 hours, then visit Grinnell Craft Brewhouse together. (https://thesandb.com/53911/sports/prairie-burners-group-ride-blazes-through-iowas-gravel-roads/)

**Tim Stahl, Imagine Grinnell President [UNKNOWN]:** "We call it a no drop ride, which means that you're always going to be watching the people at the back. Not everybody is riding shoulder to shoulder, but you stop and wait for everybody." Stahl explains the training rides evolved from an intimidating fast group to a more inclusive format to help riders prepare for Prairie Burn 100. (https://thesandb.com/53911/sports/prairie-burners-group-ride-blazes-through-iowas-gravel-roads/)

**Andrew Ruger, Staff Writer [UNKNOWN]:** "Every Tuesday at 5:30 p.m., no matter the temperature or season, the Prairie Burners meet at Grinnell's only bike shop, Bikes to You, for weekly gravel bike rides... Over the years, the group has included professors, students and Grinnell residents of all ages, united by their passion for gravel biking." The Thursday rides (April-October) offer shorter 10-15 mile beginner-friendly options. (https://thesandb.com/53911/sports/prairie-burners-group-ride-blazes-through-iowas-gravel-roads/)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Tim Stahl [UNKNOWN]:** "What makes a gravel bike is the geometry. It's pretty forgiving, with low, thick tires, and then gearing so you can climb the hills. We think of Iowa as flat, but you leave town, there are some impressive hills." He notes that while traditional road bikes can be used on gravel, specialty gravel bikes are recommended. Free gravel bike rentals are available at Bikes to You for those wanting to try the sport. (https://thesandb.com/53911/sports/prairie-burners-group-ride-blazes-through-iowas-gravel-roads/)

**Tim Stahl [UNKNOWN] - Winter Riding:** "We'll get together and it can be five degrees or ten degrees, and we can still have a short bike ride." For winter conditions, experienced riders use "fat, studded tires for traction on icy roads around town." (https://thesandb.com/53911/sports/prairie-burners-group-ride-blazes-through-iowas-gravel-roads/)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Tim Stahl [UNKNOWN]:** "Iowa has some of the best gravel roads in the world. We've got about 75,000 miles of gravel road in the state, and in our county alone, we've got over 700 miles." (https://thesandb.com/53911/sports/prairie-burners-group-ride-blazes-through-iowas-gravel-roads/)

**Laura Ferguson [UNKNOWN] - Safety Perspective:** "For me personally, I think I know of three cyclists who have been killed on Poweshiek County roads, one person who is paraplegic and so, you know, the paved roads don't feel very friendly." Ferguson notes that gravel roads offer a safer alternative to paved highways with motor vehicle traffic. (https://thesandb.com/53911/sports/prairie-burners-group-ride-blazes-through-iowas-gravel-roads/)

**Tim Stahl [UNKNOWN] - Scenery:** "You're just in this terrarium of nature that changes all the time. You can talk to people, hang out and talk, whereas on a bike path, even a Rails-to-Trail, you can't get more than three or four people riding at the same time." (https://thesandb.com/53911/sports/prairie-burners-group-ride-blazes-through-iowas-gravel-roads/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Travel Iowa [UNKNOWN]:** The 100-mile route includes a "race challenge" option and "Burner Challenge segment dash for cash on each of the loops" for competitive riders, while the 5K Fun Run "provides a nice Saturday morning option to race or pace yourself." This suggests multiple participation levels from competitive to recreational. (https://www.traveliowa.com/calendar/prairie-burn-100-gravel-bike-ride-and-5k-fun-run/1653598/)

**Official Website [UNKNOWN]:** "It is chip-timed with competitive options, but riders and runners can get out of it what they desire. This event is about having a good time, making connections and promoting all the good that comes from cycling." (https://www.prairieburn100.com/)

**Research Limitation:** This analysis is severely limited by the source quality. Only 6 of 17 sources were relevant to the Prairie Burn 100 cycling event. To provide comprehensive race intelligence (pacing data, nutrition strategies, mechanical issues, DNF factors, specific course sections, etc.), sources from actual race participants would be needed — such as Strava ride reports, cycling forum race reports, or blog posts from finishers.
