# PURGATORY ROAD RACE — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**PJ McQuade [ELITE]:** "Cat 3 report. Around 50 men in the field with a handful of P/1/2 women, who they combined with us. Chris and I staged toward the back, not worrying too much about position given the neutral start and expected the usual 'lap 1 warm up' we've been accustomed to in the 3s. OOPS. 10 dudes/2 ladies gas it as soon as they drop the flag on the Central Turnpike climb. I never even saw them go as I'm still hanging out in back. Race over."

**PJ McQuade [ELITE]:** "One thing about Purgatory is there are lots of twists and turns in narrow wooded roads so it's perfect for a break really. I also found out (once I did move up) that there were very few guys willing to work at the front." (https://minutemanroadclub.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=26&t=5499)

**PJ McQuade [ELITE]:** "I love Purgatory because it's held on the roads I train on every day, yet I can't master this one. Weird race, overall. It sums up the Cat 3 New England racing scene this year. Fiery juniors using this as a stepping stone, a few tri freaks who are clearly Cat 2s sticking around for glory, hardly any team tactics, just racing to race I guess." (https://minutemanroadclub.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=26&t=5499)

**carlshimer [ELITE]:** "I raced the cat4 35+ for 4 laps of the course. Nice weather during the entire ride. Nothing interesting during the first two laps. There was a 7 person break on the 3rd lap that started after the 3rd time up Lackey. No one made an effort to catch them... I do have an issue with lackey Rd. Maybe it is because you can't see ahead of you but this hill has my number. Unfinished business." (https://minutemanroadclub.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=26&t=5499)

**carlshimer [ELITE]:** "The difference between 8th place and 28th place was 18 seconds, which is pretty much the time I lost on the last trip up Lackey." (https://minutemanroadclub.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=26&t=5499)

**pace21 [ELITE]:** "I tried a new tactic which was to drill it on the second, longer Central turnpike hill to get a little gap and let chasers come after me and maybe that way we can light the fire. I got the little gap (10-15 sec) and held it there so someone might be tempted, but to no avail." (https://minutemanroadclub.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=26&t=5499)

**Matt Moon/Downeast Racing [ELITE]:** "The pace in the Pro 1/2 field was furious from the start. With a handful of teams well represented, the peloton struggled to find the right composition of riders to let up the road. Each time up the finishing 1 kilometer climb sapped the legs of that bit of energy, and the unrelenting chase of those riders hell bent on getting up the road began to take its tole on the field." (https://downeastracing.blogspot.com/2014/06/purgatory-road-race.html)

**Downeast Racing report [ELITE]:** "With 7 laps of the 11 mile course scheduled for the P1/2 field and the mercury tickling 88 degrees, it became a war of attrition. First to fall was Travis, his day complete after 30 miles of racing. Next to pop was Dan, who spent the first 3 laps in nearly every break that went up the road... 53 riders started the day, only 34 finished." (https://downeastracing.blogspot.com/2014/06/purgatory-road-race.html)

**Eliot Pitney [ELITE]:** "Much like the P1/2 event, the early laps had some inspired racing but with no major teams represented 2 riders were allowed to get up the road and build a 1 minute advantage on the third lap. With only 5 laps on the schedule, Eliot took the race into his own hands at the start of the 4th lap and pushed the pace, pulling 2 other riders clear of the peloton... The trio established a hard tempo and quickly bridged the 1 minute gap to the leading duo." (https://downeastracing.blogspot.com/2014/06/purgatory-road-race.html)

**jraguin [ELITE]:** "Masters 45+ with Rich and Smudger. An absolutely stacked field of 60 with the McCormacks & Tobi Schultze of Clif Bar/Pactimo, Paul Richard of CCB, Stephen Badger of Bethel Cycle, Todd Bowden of Aetna-Expo... I actually was really looking forward to mixing it up today and honestly wasn't intimidated at all which showed I had a good mindset coming into the race." (https://minutemanroadclub.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=26&t=7118)

**jraguin [ELITE]:** "Third time up Lackey is hard but not too bad, but like with every time up Lackey, these guys don't sit up at the top. They drill it on the false flat then flat going over the top which hurts." (https://minutemanroadclub.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=26&t=7118)

**cbusick [ELITE]:** "i35+ 1-4. I was completely intimidated going into this race with the stacked field road-results.com was displaying... First time up Lackey, which Jeremy had me dreading after his description of a 35+ race he was in, started off nice and steady. I was about 2/3 of the way back and thinking, oh good, they are taking it easy first time up. Then I saw Pare stand and sprint across a gap. No worries, there are 15 guys here with me, one of them will close that down. But the gap grew." (https://minutemanroadclub.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=26&t=7118)

**cbusick [ELITE]:** "Still we had 10 or so guys going into lackey the 2nd time. Shouldn't be so bad, but when we got to the top there were only 5. WTF." (https://minutemanroadclub.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=26&t=7118)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Central Turnpike climb:** This is where breaks often form immediately after the start. PJ McQuade notes "10 dudes/2 ladies gas it as soon as they drop the flag on the Central Turnpike climb" (https://minutemanroadclub.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=26&t=5499). pace21 describes it as having two climbs - a downhill past the finish line, then "the first climb" and "the second, longer Central turnpike hill" (https://minutemanroadclub.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=26&t=5499).

**Lackey Road climb:** The finishing climb, approximately 1 kilometer long. Multiple riders describe it as the decisive feature. carlshimer notes "I do have an issue with lackey Rd. Maybe it is because you can't see ahead of you but this hill has my number" (https://minutemanroadclub.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=26&t=5499). jraguin emphasizes "like with every time up Lackey, these guys don't sit up at the top. They drill it on the false flat then flat going over the top which hurts" (https://minutemanroadclub.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=26&t=7118). The climb appears multiple times per lap and is where the race is often decided.

**Mendon Road descent:** Described as fast. pace21 mentions "I tucked in for a fast descent and maintained a 10ish second gap by the end" (https://minutemanroadclub.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=26&t=5499). The group caught him as they turned onto Barnett.

**Manchaug village/climb:** Located a few miles from the finish. PJ McQuade: "At the top of the Manchaug climb with the 11 chasers dangling, dudes start to get over enthused and fidgety around me" (https://minutemanroadclub.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=26&t=5499).

**Overall course character:** PJ McQuade: "One thing about Purgatory is there are lots of twists and turns in narrow wooded roads so it's perfect for a break really" (https://minutemanroadclub.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=26&t=5499). Downeast Racing describes it as having "a little something for everyone; sharp climbs, technical corners and sweeping descents" (https://downeastracing.blogspot.com/2014/06/purgatory-road-race.html).

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**[ELITE] Early race positioning is critical:** PJ McQuade's experience shows the danger of starting too far back: "Chris and I staged toward the back, not worrying too much about position given the neutral start and expected the usual 'lap 1 warm up' we've been accustomed to in the 3s. OOPS. 10 dudes/2 ladies gas it as soon as they drop the flag... Race over. Well, for the next fifty miles anyway." (https://minutemanroadclub.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=26&t=5499)

**[ELITE] Team tactics - never chase your own break:** JeremyC's tactical guidance: "NEVER CHASE DOWN A TEAMMATE. 9 people out of 45+ still constitutes a breakaway. Rich Batten trains hard, is really fast, and deserves his teammates support... If YOU chase, you will use valuable energy and most likely NOT come in the top 10." (https://minutemanroadclub.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=26&t=7118)

**[ELITE] The course favors breaks:** PJ McQuade notes the course character enables successful breaks: "lots of twists and turns in narrow wooded roads so it's perfect for a break really" and "strong break out of sight, content peloton = fast growing gap. At the start of lap 2 it was at 45 secs, quickly grew to over a min. and was at 2 mins. at one point." (https://minutemanroadclub.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=26&t=5499)

**[ELITE] Final positioning matters more than you think:** carlshimer notes tiny time gaps: "The difference between 8th place and 28th place was 18 seconds, which is pretty much the time I lost on the last trip up Lackey" (https://minutemanroadclub.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=26&t=5499). cbusick adds: "I backed off a bit but this put me in poor position for the final climb up lackey. I probably could have raced smarter at this point to keep up near the front" (https://minutemanroadclub.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=26&t=5499).

**[ELITE] Taking initiative when the field won't work:** Eliot Pitney's winning move shows the value of committing: "With only 5 laps on the schedule, Eliot took the race into his own hands at the start of the 4th lap and pushed the pace, pulling 2 other riders clear of the peloton... The trio established a hard tempo and quickly bridged the 1 minute gap to the leading duo" (https://downeastracing.blogspot.com/2014/06/purgatory-road-race.html).

## DNF Risk Factors

**Heat attrition in Pro 1/2:** The 2014 P1/2 race saw significant attrition in hot conditions. Downeast Racing reported: "With 7 laps of the 11 mile course scheduled for the P1/2 field and the mercury tickling 88 degrees, it became a war of attrition. First to fall was Travis, his day complete after 30 miles of racing. Next to pop was Dan, who spent the first 3 laps in nearly every break that went up the road... 53 riders started the day, only 34 finished." (https://downeastracing.blogspot.com/2014/06/purgatory-road-race.html)

**Feedzone water depletion:** Same 2014 race: "there wasn't a spare drop of water in the feedzone when the event concluded. On the 6th lap Hank was seen guarding the last bidon like a mother bear protects her clubs. It was a battle both on the road and in the feedzone!" (https://downeastracing.blogspot.com/2014/06/purgatory-road-race.html)

**Repeated Lackey climbs break riders:** cbusick describes rapid field fragmentation: "Still we had 10 or so guys going into lackey the 2nd time. Shouldn't be so bad, but when we got to the top there were only 5. WTF." (https://minutemanroadclub.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=26&t=7118)

**Crash risk on late-race positioning battles:** PJ McQuade witnessed a crash: "At the top of the Manchaug climb with the 11 chasers dangling, dudes start to get over enthused and fidgety around me... I was 10th wheel when a few riders passed me on the left toward the yellow line. Another guy tries the same move but bumps my rear wheel. I stayed upright but heard a crash behind me. I never looked back but it sounded ugly." (https://minutemanroadclub.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=26&t=5499)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**New England Cat 3 racing culture:** PJ McQuade captures the scene: "It sums up the Cat 3 New England racing scene this year. Fiery juniors using this as a stepping stone, a few tri freaks who are clearly Cat 2s sticking around for glory, hardly any team tactics, just racing to race I guess. Oh well, it's still a blast." (https://minutemanroadclub.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=26&t=5499)

**Local training roads:** PJ McQuade: "I love Purgatory because it's held on the roads I train on every day, yet I can't master this one." (https://minutemanroadclub.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=26&t=5499)

**High-quality event organization:** Downeast Racing praised the organizers: "Thanks to Greenline Velo, the Town of Sutton and Pioneer Event Productions for putting on such a great event. Great course, good road surfaces, well marshaled corners and how can you not give them props for supplying podium girls?! We will see you next year for sure." (https://downeastracing.blogspot.com/2014/06/purgatory-road-race.html)

**Memorable race commentary:** carlshimer describes colorful race details including "the Amazonian moto-ref we had at Sterling (think Briene from Game of Thrones). She would slide up next to us on all of the small hills to ensure that no one went over the imaginary yellow line" and issues with "a clueless rider from BRC (rider 519). He would wobble all over the place and would very his cadence and intensity all the fucking time. I wanted to put him in the ditch... Nicest guy but a total tool on the bike." (https://minutemanroadclub.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=26&t=5499)

**Post-race parking lot scene:** Team Wheelworks had "parking lot banter after the first Purgatory road race" captured on video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PxtYgVNRPw), and carlshimer noted "The race parking was right next to an active little league field. Two cars over had a smashed windshield when I got back from the race." (https://minutemanroadclub.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=26&t=5499)
