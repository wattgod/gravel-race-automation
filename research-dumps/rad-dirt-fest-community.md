## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Lauren De Crescenzo [ELITE]:** "I tried to go a few times on the steep pitches of the first climb and was finally able to break free on a steep, sandy portion somewhere between miles 25 and 30. That was never the plan, it just felt right." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/results-lauren-de-crescenzo-and-keegan-swenson-win-2024-rad-dirt-fest/)

**Lauren De Crescenzo [ELITE]:** "The mass start was wild! I tried hanging with the male leaders early and definitely burned a few matches. But once the course tilted upward, I slipped away into my happy place. The terrain is relentless. The climbs are long and unforgiving, and you're even pedaling on the 'downhills'."

**Keegan Swenson [ELITE]:** "On that last big push back into town, Pete [Stetina] and I worked really well together. He then made two late attacks but I was able to counter them and gain a few seconds on him, and that allowed me to roll in solo to the finish. I had a good day out and a good time racing the guys out there. Today was my first time competing here and the course was rad."

**Lailah [COMPETITIVE]:** "Going into The Rad, I didn't know what to expect. I was heavily underprepared for the event, but gave it all I had regardless. Unfortunately, I had to be pulled from the race because I missed the second cutoff by just a few minutes. I was absolutely devastated, a blubbering mess on the bike, but I kept going. I wanted to see if I could go the distance... I ended up riding for another 32 miles before I bonked so hard I could barely steady myself... I rode the longest distance I ever had by almost 30 miles." (https://www.distancetoempty.com/news/2022/11/03/the-rad-dirt-fest-wrap)

**Kate [COMPETITIVE]:** "After slowly increasing my endurance and skills over the course of six other events I was excited to visit another part of the state and a final race. Just after SBT GRVL in August I had come down with Covid and spend most of the next 7 weeks recovering, not spending much time on the bike. I was unsure of my conditioning going into the Rad but knew that if I rode my ride I'd do fine. While I had definitely lost a step due to my illness and recovery, I was proud of my ride. Finishing my race faster than I had hoped, though the only PRs I set were in my own internal goals of climbing with confidence." (https://www.distancetoempty.com/news/2022/11/03/the-rad-dirt-fest-wrap)

**Hannah [COMPETITIVE]:** "Even though the weather was looking questionable, I was able to finish my first 100 mile ride and beat the rain. Trinidad gravel lived up to all the hype and my legs felt strong throughout the ride. Seeing familiar faces throughout the day at aid stations, on the road, and at the finish line was also such a cool feeling." (https://www.distancetoempty.com/news/2022/11/03/the-rad-dirt-fest-wrap)

**Cole Davis [ELITE]:** "I think races that have cool trophies will always have a special spot in my heart. I'd much rather have something memorable that I can hang up in my house than a few 100 extra bucks for sure."
