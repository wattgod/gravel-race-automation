# RAID ROCKINGHAM — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**velocb [UNKNOWN]:** "Rides like the Raid are what we live for on HUP. You throw words like gravel, dirt, rail trails at me and I am all in. Basically you had me at dirt." (http://velocb.blogspot.com/2013/06/raid-rockingham.html)

**velocb [UNKNOWN]:** "One other rider latch onto us. Did I think of it as the Forest of Arenberg? Of course I did. That is what HUP is all about. Give us dirt and mud and gravel and we shine. It is like a badge of honor. To not do well in those conditions would be unacceptable." (http://velocb.blogspot.com/2013/06/raid-rockingham.html)

**velocb [UNKNOWN]:** "Two of my favorite quotes of the whole day: First one was as we hit a Strava segment. Roger screams F Yeah STRAVA!!! And just goes full warp speed... Second one was as we were descending towards the end. I was completely cracked and fumbling for a gel pack in my pocket... Nick looks over at me and says 'Get your shit together Chip!' I bring my hands back onto the bars and barely make the turn." (http://velocb.blogspot.com/2013/06/raid-rockingham.html)

**velocb [UNKNOWN]:** "What a great day. And the reason Roger was driving such a hard pace? I had to make it back to a wedding in Boston. I got back to the car completely shattered, changed, pounded a coke and flew back to Boston." (http://velocb.blogspot.com/2013/06/raid-rockingham.html)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**velocb [UNKNOWN]:** "For me it was a simple choice. CX bike with LAS file treads. I switched to my current CX bike before the Ronde de Rosey and I am never going back. It is the best CX bike I have ever owned. I made sure it had two sets of water bottle bosses just for this reason. The LAS file treads are big meaty cx tires. I knew they would be perfect. Rolling resistance on the road isn't great compared to a 25 but road isn't what I do these rides for." (http://velocb.blogspot.com/2013/06/raid-rockingham.html)

**velocb [UNKNOWN]:** "People who chose road bikes and 25s were disappointed I have to think. Or I would have been. Sure you could do it. And maybe there is a group of riders who feel its more 'epic' to do these rides on a road machine. But why do that to yourself? Why not bring a bike equipped to do well on the road but excel on the dirt?" (http://velocb.blogspot.com/2013/06/raid-rockingham.html)

**velocb [UNKNOWN]:** "I was really impressed by the Clement tires. This was my first ride on them and they worked great. Its opened my eyes a bit. Roger was on his Winterando and 28s and had no problems at all. Nick was on a CX bike like I was." (http://velocb.blogspot.com/2013/06/raid-rockingham.html)

**General advice from event description [UNKNOWN]:** "A properly prepared gravel-ready bicycle" is recommended. The event website emphasizes preparing your bike properly for the mixed terrain. (https://www.grvl.net/raid-rockingham)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Route composition:** Both routes are approximately 30% gravel. The 60-Mile Route has 2,800' of climbing, while the 45-Mile Route has 1,900' of climbing. (https://www.grvl.net/raid-rockingham)

**velocb [UNKNOWN]:** "And then I see the first dirt section and a switch went off in my brain and I just accelerated into it and got to the front. It was hilarious seeing all the guys on road bikes and 25s smashing off rocks and going into the weeds. One guy came to a complete stop at a puddle. Did I mention we were going 25 mph down a rail trail?" (http://velocb.blogspot.com/2013/06/raid-rockingham.html)

**velocb [UNKNOWN]:** "My favorite section was definitely the CX Trail of Death. I could ride that all day. Hub deep puddles, some deeper to be honest. Nick almost took a swim at one point!" Describes encountering a sign offering an optional "CX Trail of Death" route that the fast group was hesitant about but Team Honey embraced. (http://velocb.blogspot.com/2013/06/raid-rockingham.html)

**velocb [UNKNOWN]:** "The route was fantastic. A great mix of road and dirt. As much as I resist New Hampshire is wearing me down. Its hard to not love a place with such nice roads. I have to say people were great on the route as well. We were bombing down lots of rail trail and gravel roads." (http://velocb.blogspot.com/2013/06/raid-rockingham.html)

**Rest stop locations:** One rest stop with food and beverage at approximately Mile 20 for both routes, and a Hydration Station with snacks at approximately Mile 40 for the 60-Mile riders. Both stops have port-o-potties. (https://www.grvl.net/raid-rockingham)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**velocb [UNKNOWN]:** "Of course we took off at warp speed. My body was not happy... We are flying and I am cracking. And then I see the first dirt section and a switch went off in my brain and I just accelerated into it and got to the front." Notes that the fast group started at "Cat 3 race at Canton" pace. (http://velocb.blogspot.com/2013/06/raid-rockingham.html)

**velocb [UNKNOWN]:** "And like Arenberg this first dirt sector had the same effect on our group. We didn't see 90% of the riders we started with until the first water stop." The first gravel sector split the fast starting group significantly. (http://velocb.blogspot.com/2013/06/raid-rockingham.html)

**Start procedure:** "The staged start sends groups of similarly-trained riders off at the same time." Riders self-seed by their typical road riding pace during registration. Roll off is at 9AM. (https://www.grvl.net/raid-rockingham)

**Route decision point:** "The 2 routes split right after the first rest stop at Mile 20 and the split will be prominently marked. For those riders who reach that rest stop after 11:30AM we make the decision for you, it's the 45-Mile route for you!" (https://www.grvl.net/raid-rockingham)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Event history:** "Launched in 2012, Raid Rockingham has grown to be one of New England's premier gravel events. In our first year we operated out of a construction zone behind the historic Newmarket Mills which were undergoing redevelopment at the time, we had about 75 riders. We now host more than 450 riders each year." (https://www.grvl.net/raid-rockingham)

**velocb [UNKNOWN]:** "The ride was organized in a parking lot and super chill. The promoter came through asking for who wanted to go in the fast group. We jumped in and it felt like the start of a Cat 3 race at Canton. So many familiar faces." (http://velocb.blogspot.com/2013/06/raid-rockingham.html)

**velocb [UNKNOWN]:** "The ride was so well supported. Great arrows showing the route, marshals at dangerous road crossings, they even had a port o pottie at each water stop. Very impressed." (http://velocb.blogspot.com/2013/06/raid-rockingham.html)

**velocb [UNKNOWN]:** "We passed through a few towns and the people on the sides of the road would clap and cheer us on. It was really nice." (http://velocb.blogspot.com/2013/06/raid-rockingham.html)

**Post-ride:** "The ride finishes at The Stone Church Music Club and they'll host a great post-ride party for us. The party starts around 11AM and starts winding down at 2PM, plan accordingly!" Features "cold craft beer on tap and some tasty grub to match." (https://www.grvl.net/raid-rockingham)

**Event philosophy:** "The beauty of Raid Rockingham is that it holds something for every rider, from the gravel-curious to the seasoned veteran. Our 2 route distance choices, gravel segments peppered with paved transitions and a moderate amount of climbing allow each rider to meet their own personal challenge." (https://www.grvl.net/raid-rockingham)

**Intro to Gravel category:** "Our 'Intro to Gravel' category uses the 45-Mile route and is perfect for those riders new to gravel. Our experienced Ride Guides and 'no-drop' approach make for a welcoming environment!" (https://www.grvl.net/raid-rockingham)

**velocb [UNKNOWN]:** "I like these rides because it really gives you a glimpse at your true self as well as shows you what your friends are made of. These rides expose you... Sometimes you ride for yourself other times you ride for your friends. This was one of those times where my only purpose was to be here with Roger."
