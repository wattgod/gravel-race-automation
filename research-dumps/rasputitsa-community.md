# RASPUTITSA — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**FergusYL [COMPETITIVE]:** "Last year's was my first bike race in ~15 years or so, and it immediately felt like home. The vibe reminds me a lot of mountain bike races in the early 90's where people are chatty and supportive, and it's a real festive atmosphere the whole way through." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/rasputitsa-2023/82653)

**FergusYL [COMPETITIVE]:** "My biggest regret of last year was under fueling. I felt great, set all-time power records for 20 minutes up through 2 hours, then (after a drinking a bottle and a half of Gatorade and eating maybe half a Clif bar over 3.5 hours and 50ish miles), ran out of gas with 4 or 5 miles to go." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/rasputitsa-2023/82653)

**Newcombep [COMPETITIVE]:** "The start for the 70k can be a bit brutal with the dh then immediate climbing stretch. Start line is a bit of a free forall and you could be leap frogging alot of groups once it turns uphill if your trying to find people to work with." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/rasputitsa-2023/82653)

**Newcombep [COMPETITIVE]:** "Final 7ish miles are brutal should definitely plan to stay on top of fueling really easy to fall behind with the usual temperatures. I like the liquid calories and gels since its always up or down never seems to be any flat stretchs." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/rasputitsa-2023/82653)

**Petals [UNKNOWN]:** "1600 people registered, 1300 started, 863 finished. And Rick and I were part of the finishers!" (https://discuss.360velo.com/t/rasputitsa-2019/1207)

**Petals [UNKNOWN]:** "At mile 18, I could no longer feel my left foot since my shoe was filled with water. Rick and I stopped and I replaced my socks and wrapped my feet with the baggies I wrapped my clothes in. Within 5 minutes, I could feel both my feet." (https://discuss.360velo.com/t/rasputitsa-2019/1207)

**Petals [UNKNOWN]:** "By mile 30, I no longer had a front brake and barely any back brake (yes- i had new disc pads on) so I just 'let it fly' on the downhills." (https://discuss.360velo.com/t/rasputitsa-2019/1207)

**Steve Rousseau [ELITE]:** "Looking back, we're all going to look back at Rasputitsa 2018 and laugh at our misfortune. A wrong turn! Lost in the woods! Remember the 'Bowie Loop'? But at the time, trudging through fairly deep snow for what seemed to be forever (it was 30 minutes, give or take), it was a bit of a let down." (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/2018/4/rasputitsa-is-it-a-race-or-is-it-a-ride)

**Matthew Vandivort [ELITE]:** "This strategy obviously was not conducive to garnering any sort of reasonable finishing time, but then again neither was Clay facetiming with his girlfriend up the final climb or faceplanting in the deep snow just a few hundred meters from the finish line while showboating his amateurishly elite (or is it elite amateur?) bike handling skills." (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/2018/4/rasputitsa-is-it-a-race-or-is-it-a-race)

**Dean Havelock [COMPETITIVE]:** "Around the time of the start gun, snow started to pick up in an angry fashion. It was just above freezing with steady wind blowing snow in sideways, making my 9am start time feel like an eternity away." (https://mtbvt.com/archives/27636)

**Dean Havelock [COMPETITIVE]:** "The pack caught me again carrying me through the middle of the race. Around mile 35 dropped to load up on calories missed earlier in the race. Through the excitement and energy it takes to hold onto the pack, I couldn't hesitate for a second to eat some energy bars – but I knew it was going to catch up to me." (https://mtbvt.com/archives/27636)

**Chris Burati [COMPETITIVE]:** "I hit the gas, and hit the gas, and hit the gas. It was about 9 miles to Cyberia, the dreaded mud/ice/snow mix segment, which is the last third of an already nasty, steep, somewhat technical climb, and I knew I had to get there before it became a traffic jam." (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/2017/4/rasputitsa-2017-how-the-weekend-was-won)

**Chris Burati [COMPETITIVE]:** "At this point my normalized power was 300, which I knew I couldn't sustain through the rest of race especially given my limited gearing, my lack of riding all week, and my choice to drink after work rather than complete my workouts. I blew up. I blew up hard." (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/2017/4/rasputitsa-2017-how-the-weekend-was-won)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**40mm Gravel Tires [ELITE]:** Matthew Vandivort notes: "I made the super wise decision to put slick touring tires on my bike, which was fine until the first icy, slushy descent when it was decidedly Not Fine." Recommends knobbies for snow conditions. (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/2018/4/rasputitsa-is-it-a-race-or-is-it-a-ride)

**Gearing [COMPETITIVE]:** istelzner: "38c pathfinders and 1x set-up with 42/11-34!" for the 100k. (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/rasputitsa-2023/82653)

**Gearing Warning [COMPETITIVE]:** Chris Burati: "I realized about halfway up that I brought my wheel set with my 11-28 cassette and not my 11-32, which one really needs for this race if you are running a 1x with a 40T chain ring." (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/2017/4/rasputitsa-2017-how-the-weekend-was-won)

**Cold Weather Layering [UNKNOWN]:** Petals brought: "Midweight wool baselayer, rapha windproof front wool LS Jersey, team SS Jersey, SS baselayer, rapha bibs, midweight tights, 2 pair midweight wool socks, PI waterproof jacket, 2 winter cycling hats, 2 pair winter 'waterproof' cycling gloves, thermal arm and leg warmers, PI thermal amfib jacket, glasses. Sidi winter boots." (https://discuss.360velo.com/t/rasputitsa-2019/1207)

**Emergency Gear [UNKNOWN]:** Petals recommends: "Bring plastic baggies (great for waterproofing). Bring a pair of surgical gloves (also a great waterproof barrier)." The baggies saved her feet at mile 18. (https://discuss.360velo.com/t/rasputitsa-2019/1207)

**Mountain Bike Option [COMPETITIVE]:** Evan Chismark rode a Yeti Arc hardtail with 140mm Rock Shox Pike, 2.4" Maxxis Rekon front and 2.35" Rekon Race rear. Notes: "There were a few sections when I gave the people on 40c tires and drop bars a lot of credit for taking this on at full race pace." (https://mtbvt.com/archives/27542)

**MTB vs Gravel Trade-offs [COMPETITIVE]:** Scott Miller: "I swapped out the MTB tires for some gravel tires so they would roll faster and be lighter in weight." Later stated: "If I ever do Rasputitsa again, I will ride a gravel bike." (https://mtbvt.com/archives/27542)

**Disc Brake Warning [UNKNOWN]:** Petals: "By mile 30, I no longer had a front brake and barely any back brake (yes- i had new disc pads on)" in wet 2019 conditions. (https://discuss.360velo.com/t/rasputitsa-2019/1207)

## Weather Experienced

**2019 - Extreme Cold/Wet:** Petals: "Pouring rain, sleet, snow, hail. Temp never cracked 40F. 95% on race is on 'dirt' roads better known as mud. Northern Vermont has seen record rainfall this year, which was quite noticeable. Rasputitsa 2019 was the worst weather conditions in the history of the race. Even some of the pros needed to stop due to hypothermia. 75% of people who didnt finish had stopped by rest stop #2 at mile 20." (https://discuss.360velo.com/t/rasputitsa-2019/1207)

**2018 - Snow/Ice:** Steve Rousseau describes: "After just cresting a real gut-punch of a climb up Pinkham road, the organizers directed racers onto cross-country ski trail. Initially planned, it was to be nothing more than a mile of deep, late-spring snow." The course ended up including 30+ minutes of trudging through deep snow. (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/2018/4/rasputitsa-is-it-a-race-or-is-it-a-ride)

**2023 - Mild/Dry:** FergusYL reported: "it's likely to be a dry one, since it's going to be pretty warm and sunny all week (holy crap, they're calling for 60's - 70's, which should dry things out quickly). That said, there will definitely still be some wet patches here and there up high and in the shadows on the mountains. It's been a very dry spring so far, so we don't have the usual heavy rain on top of snow melt that turns the mountains into a quagmire." Actual race day: "35-40ish" degrees. (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/rasputitsa-2023/82653)

**2022 - Snow/Slush:** Dean Havelock: "Around the time of the start gun, snow started to pick up in an angry fashion. It was just above freezing with steady wind blowing snow in sideways." Later: "The line of hikers through Cyberia in the middle of the pack was long and densely packed." (https://mtbvt.com/archives/27636)

**2017 - Rain:** Chris Burati: "I lined up at the start without seeing any teammates...The last thing I remember before the start whistle was...we sat there cold with rain pissing on us." (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/2017/4/rasputitsa-2017-how-the-weekend-was-won)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Cyberia Section:** FergusYL [COMPETITIVE]: "The potential weather is the hardest part, but it's looking to be mild-ish...The other thing to keep in mind is that the end is rough. There are some steep climbs, and the final half-mile? is a steep, sandy uphill to Burke lodge." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/rasputitsa-2023/82653)

**Cyberia Detail:** Chris Burati [COMPETITIVE]: "It was about 9 miles to Cyberia, the dreaded mud/ice/snow mix segment, which is the last third of an already nasty, steep, somewhat technical climb...This climb was a grind. I couldn't go any easier other than hard or else I would become unseated and would need to walk." (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/2017/4/rasputitsa-2017-how-the-weekend-was-won)

**Descent Hazards:** Chris Burati [COMPETITIVE]: "I came out of Cyberia, skipped the maple syrup shots that were on offer at the summit, and started the treacherous descent through the mud and snow. I was unable to clip in given the snow and mud in my cleats so I white knuckled it down." (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/2017/4/rasputitsa-2017-how-the-weekend-was-won)

**Road Quality:** Chris Burati [COMPETITIVE]: "I hit a blast hole in the dirt and my bars rotated 30 degrees downwards." Later: "I got halfway up, slowly rolled to the side, got off my bike, and leaned over it. After what seemed like an eternity, I proceeded to slowly walk towards the top." (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/2017/4/rasputitsa-2017-how-the-weekend-was-won)

**Course Profile:** FergusYL [COMPETITIVE]: "The course itself is really fun and rolly, with a fair amount of mellow Class IV road, but nothing too technical." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/rasputitsa-2023/82653)

**Finish Section:** Chris Burati [COMPETITIVE]: "I finally cracked for good on the last long dirt climb before the road into the CX course...When it flattened out I hopped back on, only to descend into a crazy mud pit, which I later learned claimed Matt's derailleur hanger." The finish includes a cyclocross course with a "dreaded pinwheel." (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/2017/4/rasputitsa-2017-how-the-weekend-was-won)

**100K Stats:** Dean Havelock [COMPETITIVE]: "The course meandered its way through the finest gravel in the North Country. It consisted of 55 miles and about 5500 vertical feet of climbing from start to finish." Top finishers "maintained speeds of 18-21mph over the entire course with 7K of climbing." (https://mtbvt.com/archives/27636)

**Early Miles:** Dean Havelock [COMPETITIVE]: "Within the first two miles of the race the entire pack was forced off their bikes for ankle/axle deep mud where a surfboard would have been the most efficient." (https://mtbvt.com/archives/27636)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Fueling Strategy [COMPETITIVE]:** FergusYL advises: "Best advice I can think of would be to focus on hydration and nutrition. It's probably going to be cool considering the time of year (35-40ish), so you may not feel as thirsty and hungry as you actually are. Take full advantage of the rest stops. They've got good snacks, plus whiskey and maple syrup at the last one or two." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/rasputitsa-2023/82653)

**Fueling Warning [COMPETITIVE]:** Newcombep: "Final 7ish miles are brutal should definitely plan to stay on top of fueling really easy to fall behind with the usual temperatures. I like the liquid calories and gels since its always up or down never seems to be any flat stretchs." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/rasputitsa-2023/82653)

**Energy Management [COMPETITIVE]:** FergusYL: "So definitely save something for the end" due to "steep climbs, and the final half-mile? is a steep, sandy uphill to Burke lodge." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/rasputitsa-2023/82653)

**Pacing Failure Example [COMPETITIVE]:** Chris Burati with normalized power at 300W: "At this point my normalized power was 300, which I knew I couldn't sustain through the rest of race especially given my limited gearing, my lack of riding all week, and my choice to drink after work rather than complete my workouts. I blew up. I blew up hard." (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/2017/4/rasputitsa-2017-how-the-weekend-was-won)

**Start Line Positioning [COMPETITIVE]:** Chris Burati: "I was probably inside the front 100, which was fine; it just meant I needed to pass people en masse...I knew I had to move up especially after I saw Colin T and Roger - amazingly I might add - riding lawns on the outside of the group to move WAY up." (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/2017/4/rasputitsa-2017-how-the-weekend-was-won)

**Getting to Cyberia Early [COMPETITIVE]:** Chris Burati: "It was about 9 miles to Cyberia...and I knew I had to get there before it became a traffic jam." (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/2017/4/rasputitsa-2017-how-the-weekend-was-won)

**Mental Approach [UNKNOWN]:** Petals: "I kept my head down and sang the mantra 'pedal, pedal, pedal' in my head. I knew to limit my stopping so I wouldn't cool off." And: "I was like Dory from Finding Nemo 'Just keep swimming.' I went at a steady pace and broke the ride into small, bite-size pieces." (https://discuss.360velo.com/t/rasputitsa-2019/1207)

**Pre-Race Mindset [UNKNOWN]:** Coach_Theia commenting on Petals: "Important to point out here something that few people realize: you decided at the beginning of the race that you were going to FINISH the race. That put you in the mindset for conquering this race." (https://discuss.360velo.com/t/rasputitsa-2019/1207)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Hypothermia (2019):** Petals: "The weather was dangerous and no joke. Five of the people I went with stopped due to hypothermia- all before mile 20." And: "75% of people who didnt finish had stopped by rest stop #2 at mile 20." (https://discuss.360velo.com/t/rasputitsa-2019/1207)

**Underfeeding [COMPETITIVE]:** FergusYL: "My biggest regret of last year was under fueling. I felt great, set all-time power records for 20 minutes up through 2 hours, then (after a drinking a bottle and a half of Gatorade and eating maybe half a Clif bar over 3.5 hours and 50ish miles), ran out of gas with 4 or 5 miles to go." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/rasputitsa-2023/82653)

**Mechanical Failures:** Chris Burati [COMPETITIVE] experienced bent derailleur hanger requiring mid-race indexing adjustment. Matthew Vandivort [ELITE] noted: "Clay's shifter broke, forcing him to unexpectedly compete in the single speed category. Ted's Di2 became unplugged, leaving him the choice between two chainrings." And later: "a crazy mud pit, which I later learned claimed Matt's derailleur hanger." (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/2018/4/rasputitsa-is-it-a-race-or-is-it-a-ride and https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/2017/4/rasputitsa-2017-how-the-weekend-was-won)

**Cramping:** Petals [UNKNOWN]: "Rick stated to cramp in both thighs at mile 26." Sweep vehicles provided Hotshot for cramping. (https://discuss.360velo.com/t/rasputitsa-2019/1207)

**Brake Failure:** Petals [UNKNOWN]: "By mile 30, I no longer had a front brake and barely any back brake (yes- i had new disc pads on)" in wet conditions. (https://discuss.360velo.com/t/rasputitsa-2019/1207)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Core Ethos:** Official site: "Rasputitsa transcends the realm of a mere gravel cycling race; it embodies a homegrown, self-supported endeavor that tests the limits of the mind, body, and soul...It welcomes all individuals and all types of bicycles, fostering inclusivity and a shared passion for exploration." (https://rasputitsadirt.com/)

**Race vs Ride Philosophy:** Results page states: "If you're looking for podiums and podium-placed winners, look elsewhere. That's not what this race is about. Our goal here is a little different; instead of racing against each other to the finish line, we encourage participants to challenge themselves and be the best they can be - with the biggest prize going to that mysterious final racer known as Lanterne Rouge." (https://rasputitsadirt.com/results)

**Community Support:** FergusYL [COMPETITIVE]: "The vibe reminds me a lot of mountain bike races in the early 90's where people are chatty and supportive, and it's a real festive atmosphere the whole way through." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/rasputitsa-2023/82653)

**Aid Station Creativity:** Matthew Vandivort [ELITE] describes: "someone had not just baked several dozen cookies for the racers but they also setup a mini-bar in their front yard" with a spray painted 'cookies and shots' sign. Official aid stations offered "Woodford Reserve to PBR at the midway point and Fireball pickleback shots in the final miles." (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/2018/4/rasputitsa-is-it-a-race-or-is-it-a-ride)

**Yeti Tradition:** Matthew Vandivort [ELITE]: "They even added to the tundra ambiance by having friends dress up as Yetis offering shots of maple syrup to riders in eco-friendly, toss-away glasses made from ice. In 2019, family members of finishers worried their loved ones were hypothermic when riders claimed they'd seen a Yeti. But Myers reassured the families that no medical attention was needed. 'They're our Yetis out there,' she said." (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/2018/4/rasputitsa-is-it-a-race-or-is-it-a-ride)

**Rainbow Unicorns:** Chris Hadgis: "Rainbow-colored, grinning unicorns jump up and down, cheer, and offer you homemade chocolate chip cookies as you pedal past." One volunteer "made thousands of cookis for an aid station." (https://theradavist.com/2022-rasputitsa-dirt-gravel-cycling-event)

**Sweep Support:** Petals [UNKNOWN]: "The sweep vehicles and company did an amazing job! When Rick was cramping, the sweep stopped and gave him a Hotshot. They would check on him multiple times after that." (https://discuss.360velo.com/t/rasputitsa-2019/1207)

**Local Community:** Dean Havelock [COMPETITIVE]: "The Northeast Kingdom area of Vermont is an amazing community!!! They were out cheering! They helped bring bikes back to the start. They participated in the party, foodzones, and cheering sections." (https://mtbvt.com/archives/27636)

**Finish Line:** Dean Havelock [COMPETITIVE]: "Jay was an awesome venue for the race greeting finishers with beers, food, smoothies, and a bike wash to knock off the built-up mud from miles 1-5 and 53-55. I enjoyed my chicken and beer with a view of the mountain from an Adirondack to attempt to process what I had just put myself through." (https://mtbvt.com/archives/27636)

**Post-Race Consensus:** Dean Havelock [COMPETITIVE]: "As competitors waited for the bike wash, they too were in the depths of processing. After walking through the crowd and chatting with riders, although beaten down There was a collective consensus that the race was an absolute blast." (https://mtbvt.com/archives/27636)

**Founder Philosophy:** Chris Hadgis on founders Heidi Myers and Anthony Moccia: "When they set out to create a race, they wanted to create something fun for themselves and their friends. In 2014, the first Rasputitsa — Russian for 'mud season'— had 300 registrants. On April 30th, 2022, the seventh, Myers and Moccia welcomed over two thousand participants." Myers stated their motivation: "derived from a real effort to get to know our riders. To care for them as people, not numbers. We lead with that; the rest just comes." (https://theradavist.com/2022-rasputitsa-dirt-gravel-cycling-event)

**Weekend Experience:** Matthew Vandivort [ELITE]: "The rest of our time in Vermont was spent with a near perfect mix of adult beverages around a fire pit a top Burke Mountain with a minor assortment of late night video game nonsense at the hotel arcade. Stories were told, laughs were shared and it was the all around pleasant type of fun that comes when you surround yourself with a great group of friends." (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/2018/4/rasputitsa-is-it-a-race-or-is-it-a-ride)

**Event Verdict:** Matthew Vandivort [ELITE]: "In the end it all gets jumbled together on the steep dirt roads and beautiful countryside of Vermont in what winds up being one heck of a good weekend." (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/2018/4/rasputitsa-is-it-a-race-or-is-it-a-ride)
