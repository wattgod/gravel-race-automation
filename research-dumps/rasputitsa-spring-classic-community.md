# RASPUTITSA SPRING CLASSIC — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Steve Rousseau [ELITE]:** "Of course, mechanicals happened. Cullen's shifter broke, forcing him to unexpectedly compete in the single speed category. Ted's Di2 became unplugged, leaving him the choice between two chainrings. I made the super wise decision to put slick touring tires on my bike, which was fine until the first icy, slushy descent when it was decidedly Not Fine." (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/2018/4/rasputitsa-is-it-a-race-or-is-it-a-ride)

**Steve Rousseau [ELITE]:** "After just cresting a real gut-punch of a climb up Pinkham road, the organizers directed racers onto cross-country ski trail. Initially planned, it was to be nothing more than a mile of deep, spring snow... Where things went a little south is when the front group of racers happened to miss a left turn onto Dashney road (whether or not a sign was actually there isn't exactly clear!) and kept trudging through another mile and change of snow... trudging through fairly deep snow for what seemed to be forever (it was 30 minutes, give or take), it was a bit of a let down." (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/2018/4/rasputitsa-is-it-a-race-or-is-it-a-ride)

**Matthew Vandivort [ELITE]:** "Perhaps it is my long-standing preference for criteriums or my 'big boned' body structure talking but I have always found it easy to slide into Rasputitsa with the mindset that it is definitely not a race. This year that recreational mindset was exacerbated by an unexpectedly late night drive to Burke that put me on the start line fueled with too few hours of sleep and far too much Red Bull for breakfast." (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/2018/4/rasputitsa-is-it-a-race-or-is-it-a-ride)

**Matthew Vandivort [ELITE]:** "Yes, someone had not just baked several dozen cookies for the racers but they also setup a mini-bar in their front yard. And since for the #chillpals Rasputitsa was not a race we quite obviously choose to partake in some liquid refreshment... This strategy obviously was not conducive to garnering any sort of reasonable finishing time, but then again neither was Clay facetiming with his girlfriend up the final climb or faceplanting in the deep snow just a few hundred meters from the finish line." (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/2018/4/rasputitsa-is-it-a-race-or-is-it-a-ride)

**Ben Brown [ELITE]:** "My goal for this race was to place better than I did in last year's edition in which I placed ~30th. Anything in the top 20 would have been gravy. I planned to ride within myself, conserve and generally do as little as I could... I conserved energy, I ate every half hour religiously and drank as much as possible. I kept waiting for a big crack but it just never came... P6 in this race was one of those days for me." (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/rasputitsa-recap-the-northeasts-gravel-spring-classic)

**Ben Brown [ELITE]:** "We arrived at the last really steep pitch of the day — a cruel 500m punch at around 15-20% — and that's where things splintered for the final time. I could already feel my legs starting to cramp when Ian put in a big effort. I furiously tried to swallow the half-masticated Clif bar in my mouth but opted to regurgitate it instead. It landed on my stem and, in a real lowlight of the race, I simply ate it once the attack was over. Fuel is fuel, right?" (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/rasputitsa-recap-the-northeasts-gravel-spring-classic)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**[ELITE] Tire Choice - Critical:** Steve Rousseau made what he called "the super wise decision to put slick touring tires on my bike, which was fine until the first icy, slushy descent when it was decidedly Not Fine." He noted that for riders who "were smart and raced on knobbies, it was a chance to pass some folks with sub-par bike handling skills" during the snow sections. (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/2018/4/rasputitsa-is-it-a-race-or-is-it-a-ride)

**[ELITE] Mechanical Vulnerabilities:** The 2018 edition saw multiple mechanical failures among elite riders: "Cullen's shifter broke, forcing him to unexpectedly compete in the single speed category. Ted's Di2 became unplugged, leaving him the choice between two chainrings." (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/2018/4/rasputitsa-is-it-a-race-or-is-it-a-ride)

**[UNKNOWN] Bike Category Diversity:** Results show categories for Men Fatbike, Men Mountain Bike, Men Open, Men Singlespeed, and Men Tandem, indicating the event welcomes a wide variety of equipment. Fatbike winner Guillaume Mailhot finished in 2:38:44. (https://results.bikereg.com/race/11394)

## Weather Experienced

**2018 Edition:** "For 2018, there was a bit of a let down to have had such an amazing day on the bike" but conditions included "very deep snow" and "icy, slushy descents." The course "goes up 4,300 feet in 40 miles" and featured "mostly mud and slush." Organizers directed racers onto "cross-country ski trail... nothing more than a mile of deep, late-spring snow." (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/2018/4/rasputitsa-is-it-a-race-or-is-it-a-ride)

**2016 Edition:** "In previous years it's been defined by the amount of mud and snow challenging riders. For 2016, there was a dramatic departure from past inclement weather as bright blue skies and milder temperatures that surged into the teens were the norm." (https://pedalmag.com/rasputitsa-gravel-race-report-results-photos-bessette-wins-surch-takes-second/)

**2019 Edition:** "Drizzle, 38 degrees, wind 2 mph" (https://results.bikereg.com/race/11394)

**Recent Editions:** "The last two editions have been raced on fast, dry roads and clear, warm days (as opposed to the snowbound slugfests of previous years)." (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/rasputitsa-recap-the-northeasts-gravel-spring-classic)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**[ELITE] Starting Dynamics:** "A massive, downhill neutral start rolls into into a tight left hand corner where the road goes straight up. It is on this climb that the first selection of the day get made... you want to be in relatively good position going into this climb to avoid spending too much energy within the first two miles." (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/rasputitsa-recap-the-northeasts-gravel-spring-classic)

**[ELITE] Key Sections - Cyberia:** "I hit Cyberia (a section of jeep trail known for creating gaps) in approximately 7th wheel which was a big goal since bad positioning on that fucked me last year. We ripped along the jeep trail dodging puddles and rocks." Ben Brown noted this section is critical for positioning. (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/rasputitsa-recap-the-northeasts-gravel-spring-classic)

**[ELITE] Final Climbs:** "We arrived at the last really steep pitch of the day — a cruel 500m punch at around 15-20% — and that's where things splintered for the final time." This comes at approximately 10 miles to go. Before this is the "Notorious B-I-G" climb at around 30 miles where selections happen. (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/rasputitsa-recap-the-northeasts-gravel-spring-classic)

**[ELITE] Technical Sections:** "The second single track sector of the day" features "a greasy log" where riders can easily slip. The course includes multiple singletrack sections that break up the gravel roads. (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/rasputitsa-recap-the-northeasts-gravel-spring-classic)

**[RECREATIONAL] Mid-Pack Experience:** "The line of hikers through Cyberia in the middle of the pack was long and densely packed" - indicating that the jeep trail section becomes a bottleneck for recreational riders who end up hiking. (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/2018/4/rasputitsa-is-it-a-race-or-is-it-a-ride)

**Course Stats:** "A psychotic 72.42km (45-mile), insane, drop-to-your-knees-and-cry suffer-fest" with "4,300 feet in 40 miles" of climbing. Note: Recent editions mention the "long course has ballooned to a whopping 100km(!)" (https://pedalmag.com/rasputitsa-gravel-race-report-results-photos-bessette-wins-surch-takes-second/ and https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/rasputitsa-recap-the-northeasts-gravel-spring-classic)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**[ELITE] Conservation Strategy:** Ben Brown's 6th place strategy: "I planned to ride within myself, conserve and generally do as little as I could... I stayed tucked away in the bunch and did very very little work for the first part of the race which meant I felt good when the bigger climbs came around." (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/rasputitsa-recap-the-northeasts-gravel-spring-classic)

**[ELITE] Nutrition Protocol:** Ben Brown: "I ate every half hour religiously and drank as much as possible." This strategy helped him avoid the expected crack and achieve his best-ever result. (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/rasputitsa-recap-the-northeasts-gravel-spring-classic)

**[ELITE] Critical Positioning Points:** "I hit Cyberia (a section of jeep trail known for creating gaps) in approximately 7th wheel which was a big goal since bad positioning on that fucked me last year." Early positioning on technical sections is make-or-break for elite placing. (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/rasputitsa-recap-the-northeasts-gravel-spring-classic)

**[ELITE] When Selections Happen:** First selection on the opening climb within 2 miles. Second major selection at Cyberia (jeep trail section). Third at the "Notorious B-I-G" climb around 30 miles. Final splits on the 15-20% pitch with 10 miles to go. (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/rasputitsa-recap-the-northeasts-gravel-spring-classic)

**[RECREATIONAL] Alternative Approach:** Matthew Vandivort and Clay rode as "#chillpals" stopping at aid stations with "beer and liquor" - "someone had not just baked several dozen cookies for the racers but they also setup a mini-bar in their front yard... From there we fell into an smooth rhythm that was appropriate to our chosen #chillpals hashtag: Clay would drop me up the inclines again and again but pull wheelies at the top until I slowly caught back on." Their "finishing time" was secondary to having "an exceedingly memorable 'not a race' day on the bike." (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/2018/4/rasputitsa-is-it-a-race-or-is-it-a-race-or-is-it-a-ride)

**Race Mentality:** "The mentality is simply more marathon than road race... to 'race' Rasputitsa just meant pedaling hard" rather than pack tactics. Field size of 1,300 people (2018) means "trying to navigate a pack of 1,300 people brings reasonable expectations that you'll do well." (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/2018/4/rasputitsa-is-it-a-race-or-is-it-a-ride)

## DNF Risk Factors

**[ELITE] Mechanical Failures:** Multiple mechanicals documented in 2018 elite field including shifter breaks and Di2 disconnections. "Mechanicals happened" is treated as expected rather than exceptional. (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/2018/4/rasputitsa-is-it-a-race-or-is-it-a-ride)

**[ELITE] Cramping Risk:** Ben Brown: "I could already feel my legs starting to cramp" on the final 15-20% pitch with 10 miles remaining, indicating cramping is a risk even for well-prepared elite riders late in the race. (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/rasputitsa-recap-the-northeasts-gravel-spring-classic)

**Equipment Choice Consequences:** Wrong tire choice (slick touring tires) made "icy, slushy descents" dangerous and slow, though Steve Rousseau still finished. (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/2018/4/rasputitsa-is-it-a-race-or-is-it-a-ride)

**Course Marking Issues:** In 2018, "the front group of racers happened to miss a left turn onto Dashney road (whether or not a sign was actually there isn't exactly clear!) and kept trudging through another mile and change of snow" - the so-called "Bowie Loop" that cost the leaders 30 minutes. (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/2018/4/rasputitsa-is-it-a-race-or-is-it-a-ride)

**Crashes:** Baker "slipped and took a nap in the woods" on Cyberia jeep trail and "chased back on like a champ but I could tell it had taken it out of him." Ben Brown "slipped on a greasy log and keeled over so slowly that I was able to apologise to the rider behind me before I hit the deck" but was able to chase back. (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/rasputitsa-recap-the-northeasts-gravel-spring-classic)

**Tragic Incident:** "After the finish, we were saddened to learn of the unexpected passing of Richard Wanstall who was killed in a collision with a car during the race." This indicates vehicle traffic is present on course. (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/rasputitsa-recap-the-northeasts-gravel-spring-classic)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Event Philosophy:** "Rasputitsa transcends the realm of a mere gravel cycling race; it embodies a homegrown, self-supported endeavor that tests the limits of the mind, body, and soul... This event offers an authentic experience that wholeheartedly embraces the elements of the unknown and change. It welcomes all individuals and all types of bicycles, fostering inclusivity and a shared passion for exploration." (https://rasputitsadirt.com/)

**Race vs. Ride Ambiguity:** "It is the question we receive more often than any other when it comes to Rasputitsa. But even after a third consecutive year venturing north the Vermont countryside for one of the most popular gravel grinders in the country the answer remains as vague as it was." The event "is about so much more than a few hours of Vermont hills, dirt roads... It is a memorable weekend away from the chaos of New York City with friends and teammates. It is a good excuse to drink some very good Vermont beers. It is a unique cross section of the cycling community coming together in a manner that is completely distinct to traditional USAC racing." (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/2018/4/rasputitsa-is-it-a-race-or-is-it-a-ride)

**Participant Mix:** "For those that want to pedal hard there is the opportunity to do so with/against some of the most recognizable names in this emerging genre of gravel grinders – Ted King, Jeremy Powers, Alison Tetrick, Anthony Clark, and the like. It is a rare chance to learn how you shape up against athletes of that caliber. And for those that want to take rest breaks every fifteen miles to slam a PBR? There is an equally enjoyable opportunity to do so just a handful of minutes back down the road from those racing at the pointy end of the event. Want to ride a fat bike? A tandem? A tandem fat bike? There is room for any and all of the above." (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/2018/4/rasputitsa-is-it-a-race-or-is-it-a-ride)

**On-Course Support:** Aid stations feature "cookies and shots" with residents setting up "a mini-bar in their front yard." Mid-race there were offerings ranging "from Woodford Reserve to PBR at the midway point and Fireball pickleback shots in the final miles." (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/2018/4/rasputitsa-is-it-a-race-or-is-it-a-ride)

**Post-Race:** "grabbed our complimentary beers (bring your wrist band)" and "The finish was at the Burke Publik House." Weekend includes "a near perfect mix of adult beverages around a fire pit a top Burke Mountain." (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/rasputitsa-recap-the-northeasts-gravel-spring-classic and https://pedalmag.com/rasputitsa-gravel-race-report-results-photos-bessette-wins-surch-takes-second/)

**No Prize Purse:** "If you're looking for podiums and podium-placed winners, look elsewhere. That's not what this race is about... no prize purse here but still plenty of hugs awaiting you if you can just dig deep and push on!" They celebrate "that mysterious final racer known as Lanterne Rouge." (https://rasputitsadirt.com/results)

**Growth:** Event has grown from "a pack of 50 or so enthusiasts" in early years to "over 600 riders" (2016) and "1,300 people" (2018), with recent editions having "1500 cyclists" (2024). (https://pedalmag.com/rasputitsa-gravel-race-report-results-photos-bessette-wins-surch-takes-second/ and https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/2018/4/rasputitsa-is-it-a-race-or-is-it-a-ride and https://rasputitsadirt.com/events)

**Charity Component:** The event "continues to grow while raising thousands of dollars for charity." There's also community support initiatives like "A Day at the Races" where they ask the community to ride/run/ski on a specific date using #adayattheraces to support community members facing challenges. (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/2018/4/rasputitsa-is-it-a-race-or-is-it-a-ride and https://rasputitsadirt.com/new-page)

**Memorial:** Before the race start, there were "a few, moving words from Mo Wilson's mother (East Burke was Mo's hometown)" indicating the event honors fallen community members. (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/rasputitsa-recap-the-northeasts-gravel-spring-classic)

**Location:** Based in East Burke, Vermont in the Northeast Kingdom, "home of Kingdom Trails." (https://pedalmag.com/rasputitsa-gravel-race-report-results-photos-bessette-wins-surch-takes-second/)
