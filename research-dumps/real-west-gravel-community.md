# REAL WEST GRAVEL — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Matthew Wiebe [ELITE]:** "Max and I chat a bit and kind of silently agree that we'll be trading pulls into this crazy headwind for the rest of the day. We send the gnarly mud section into Aid 2, my 45s were a big win here and I gapped Max by quite a bit. I didn't attack but I didn't slow down - I figured he had chose the little tires so he could do a bit of work to get back up to me and then we could work together again."

**Matthew Wiebe [ELITE]:** "In hindsight I think I should have lead into the climb and laid down a hard pace right from the start - I think that would have played to my strengths a bit better." On finishing second after being caught in the final sprint. (https://argonautcycles.com/real-west-gravel-from-matthews-eyes/)

**Matthew Wiebe [ELITE]:** "Ok, race day - the weather turned out to be a bit better than expected. I go bare legs and lots of embro, it's gonna be fun. We show up to the start line and I make note of a few guys on some pretty skinny, bald looking tires. I also notice that the pro field isn't packed." (https://argonautcycles.com/real-west-gravel-from-matthews-eyes/)

**Matthew Wiebe [ELITE]:** "With only three of us really rotating on the front at this point and the rest of the field playing passenger I figured I would give it a good wack here to see who was serious. Over the top of the riser I pull off and then there were only three of us." On attacking at mile 6. (https://argonautcycles.com/real-west-gravel-from-matthews-eyes/)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**[ELITE] Matthew Wiebe's Setup:**
- Bike: Argonaut GR3
- Tires: 45mm Schwalbe G-One RS ("Very happy with this choice today. Was descending better than anyone else in the mud since most people ran narrow, low tread tires.")
- Gearing: SRAM XPLR Transmission, 48T front, 10/46 rear
- Nutrition: (2) bottles of 100g MNSTRY powder, (4) MNSTRY gels (consumed 3 of 4 gels, both bottles)
(https://argonautcycles.com/real-west-gravel-from-matthews-eyes/)

**[UNKNOWN] Official Course Recommendation:**
"35 MM and, if wet, 38 MM for increased contact area" as minimum tire sizes. (https://www.mudslingerevents.com/west-coast-gravel)

**Note:** The elite winner ran narrow, low-tread tires and lost ground to Matthew's 45mm tires in the mud sections, suggesting wider tires with tread may be advantageous in wet conditions even if slightly slower in dry conditions.

**Matthew Wiebe [ELITE] 2025 conditions:** "Forecast showed, some big winds, a nice dusting of rain, and temps that would dip into the mid 30s at points on course... the weather turned out to be a bit better than expected." He wore bare legs with lots of embrocation. On the exposed plateau: "Here the temps dipped down into the mid 30s with a very strong headwind. One of the guys in our group pulled out of the race after this section because of the cold." (https://argonautcycles.com/real-west-gravel-from-matthews-eyes/)

**General pattern:** "Over the past decade we have operated on the first weekend of May, we have had great weather 75% of the time and only twice was the weather less than favorable. Always bring good rain gear when visiting the Oregon Coast!" (https://www.mudslingerevents.com/west-coast-gravel)
