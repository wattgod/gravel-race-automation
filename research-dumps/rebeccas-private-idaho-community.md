# REBECCA'S PRIVATE IDAHO — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Edyn Teitge [COMPETITIVE]:** "I was pretty excited for the TT because one of my strong points is climbing... The climb was pretty steep and we gained over 1000 ft, but I was able to maintain a speed of around 10 mph." On the Baked Potato stage: "I spent the next 30 miles alone, struggling against a headwind, trying to catch up with the group ahead... After an eternity of being alone, a group from behind caught up and I jumped on with them." Finished 19th overall on Baked Potato, 10th QSR rider, 8th overall in QSR General Classification.

**SEAJAYBIKE [ELITE]:** "I'm starting to outfit for the Queen's Stage Race next Labor Day. Any comment on conditions and popular tires for the terrain? Watching video I don't see much sidewall killing rock." (https://www.bikeforums.net/cyclocross-gravelbiking-recreational/1160812-rebecca-s-private-idaho.html)

**Rebecca Rusch (Race Founder):** "Even though I am a mountain biker, racer and athlete at heart, I launched one of the first gravel events in the U.S., as opposed to mountain biking, because it was an interesting way to explore and adventure outside your backyard and more people could come and discover gravel biking in Sun Valley. RPI will push your mind and body further than you think you can. To do a collective group event like RPI, a collective effervescence happens, which is amazing and powerful energy."

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**SEAJAYBIKE [ELITE]:** Considering "Challenge Grav Grinder Race or VIttoria Terreno Zero. 40mm range" after watching course video and not seeing much sidewall-killing rock. (https://www.bikeforums.net/cyclocross-gravelbiking-recreational/1160812-rebecca-s-private-idaho.html)

**Wilmingtech [UNKNOWN]:** Suggested checking "the tread on the Dry's, might be a little better suited than the zero's" (https://www.bikeforums.net/cyclocross-gravelbiking-recreational/1160812-rebecca-s-private-idaho.html)

**shoota [UNKNOWN]:** "With that much descending I'd want a tire with a little bite on the sidewall. I vote Drys." (https://www.bikeforums.net/cyclocross-gravelbiking-recreational/1160812-rebecca-s-private-idaho.html)

**Chris(NJ) [UNKNOWN]:** Referenced categorization system that places RPI as "Category 3 gravel: Poorly maintained roads with bigger rocks, ruts and/or sand. Ideal bike: Gravel bike. Tire size: 33-38mm" (https://www.bikeforums.net/cyclocross-gravelbiking-recreational/1160812-rebecca-s-private-idaho.html)

**Edyn Teitge [COMPETITIVE]:** Rode a Rodeo Labs TD4. "On the descent, I hit a rock hard with my front wheel and I just crossed my fingers that I didn't get a flat or crack my Rodeo 2.0 rim, I didn't so that was a relief." Also noted the TD4 "felt good and secure on the downhill" during the sketchy descent on stage 2. (https://www.rodeo-labs.com/edyns-adventures-rebeccas-private-idaho/)

## Weather Experienced

**2023 Baked Potato Stage (Edyn Teitge report):** "The weather looked like it would be rather interesting with it calling for rain the entire day... This is also where it also started to rain and get colder, and while I was riding, I put on a few extra layers." Temperature at Stage 1 start was "a very cold 34 degrees F." By Baked Potato stage, mud conditions developed: "The road had become muddy from the rain and we were in such a tight formation, trying to get the most draft, that a ton of mud was flung up, right to the face. It would cover everyone's glasses, making it hard to see." (https://www.rodeo-labs.com/edyns-adventures-rebeccas-private-idaho/)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Stage 1 - Harriman Trail (35 miles, 3,505' elevation):** Described as "one of the most beautiful and technical stages as it winds up the Harriman, a non-motorized double-track trail at the foot of the Boulder Mountains." After 12 miles, "the course turned onto a steep single-track climb... After the steep climb, there was a really fun descent and even though it was a bit bumpy on gravel bikes." Course passes start/finish area then continues "about five miles farther down the trail" to turnaround. (https://eyeonsunvalley.com/Story_Reader/12010/Rebecca's-Private-Idaho-Race-to-Get-Shoshone-Bannock-Blessing/ and https://www.rodeo-labs.com/edyns-adventures-rebeccas-private-idaho/)

**Stage 2 - Dollarhide Summit TT (50 miles, 3,057' elevation):** Features "a short, 4.5-mile hill climb timed segment within a bigger 50-mile ride." Starts with "roughly 20-mile neutral rollout." The climb is "pretty steep" gaining "over 1000 ft." Descent has "20 mph speed limit going down the pass because people were still time-trialing it" but after TT start point "we could go as fast as we wanted. It was a sketchy descent as the road was bumpy and everyone was tight together." (https://eyeonsunvalley.com/Story_Reader/12010/Rebecca's-Private-Idaho-Race-to-Get-Shoshone-Bannock-Blessing/ and https://www.rodeo-labs.com/edyns-adventures-rebeccas-private-idaho/)

**Stage 3 - Baked Potato (103 miles, ~6,000' elevation):** "Started racing just before the base of the Trail Creek climb." Course includes "Wildhorse Canyon" where riders encountered fresh cow pies. Features a technical climb called "El Diablo, a part that Rebecca put in just to torture you before the downhill to the finish." Significant headwind section mid-race. (https://www.rodeo-labs.com/edyns-adventures-rebeccas-private-idaho/)

**General:** Course traverses "three of the state's most coveted mountain ranges... the Boulder Mountains on the Harriman Trail, up Dollarhide Summit in the Smoky Mountains and against the backdrop of the Pioneer Mountains over Trail Creek Summit." (https://eyeonsunvalley.com/Story_Reader/12010/Rebecca's-Private-Idaho-Race-to-Get-Shoshone-Bannock-Blessing/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Edyn Teitge [COMPETITIVE] - Stage 1 Strategy:** "For stage one we were about ready to rally... The race started with a countdown and then Rebecca Rusch hitting a massive gong. We didn't go off too hard but it definitely wasn't an easy pace. For the first five miles, I was able to ride with the lead group and then I dropped off and rode solo for a bit." Used rollers for warmup since it was a shorter 35-mile stage. (https://www.rodeo-labs.com/edyns-adventures-rebeccas-private-idaho/)

**Edyn Teitge [COMPETITIVE] - Baked Potato Pacing:** "I was able to stick with the first group for a couple of miles but then decided to drop off. With a hundred more miles to go, I didn't want to blow up." Successfully worked with another rider: "Joel, caught up to me and I jumped on his tail. We each took turns pulling and were able to average 30mph until we caught back up to the group ahead of us." Spent approximately 30 miles solo mid-race before another group caught him. (https://www.rodeo-labs.com/edyns-adventures-rebeccas-private-idaho/)

**Stage 3 - Rest Day Decision:** Edyn chose not to do the optional social ride on Saturday, stating "I wanted to get as much rest as possible before the big stage." (https://www.rodeo-labs.com/edyns-adventures-rebeccas-private-idaho/)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Mud and visibility issues:** In wet conditions on Baked Potato, "a ton of mud was flung up, right to the face. It would cover everyone's glasses, making it hard to see and I found myself wiping my glasses off with my gloves. Half of the time this worked, and the other half it just smeared and made it worse." (https://www.rodeo-labs.com/edyns-adventures-rebeccas-private-idaho/)

**Hitting the wall on climbs:** On El Diablo climb: "I started to hit a wall going up the technical El Diablo... This is where I lost the group I had been riding with." (https://www.rodeo-labs.com/edyns-adventures-rebeccas-private-idaho/)

**Water availability:** Need to plan for aid station stops: "I had to, unfortunately, pull off for water from an aid station" which cost 30 miles of solo riding to catch back to a group. (https://www.rodeo-labs.com/edyns-adventures-rebeccas-private-idaho/)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Rebecca Rusch on event purpose:** "RPI is the Be Good™ Foundation's largest fundraising event for the year. The four-day event, which has 1,500-plus attendees, allows everyone to learn and understand the Foundation's purpose, including providing bikes to those who want to ride, especially for mental well-being... Through scholarships, we help people get on bikes and ride." (https://eyeonsunvalley.com/Story_Reader/12010/Rebecca's-Private-Idaho-Race-to-Get-Shoshone-Bannock-Blessing/)

**Edyn Teitge on atmosphere:** On Stage 2 TT: "When I got to the top everyone was encouraging." On Stage 1 neutral rollout: "This was fun, as there was only a little talking on the previous stage, with everyone pushing it hard." Overall: "it was a really fun race and I am super happy about how both myself and my new rodeo whip felt and performed. I definitely will be back to do it again." (https://www.rodeo-labs.com/edyns-adventures-rebeccas-private-idaho/)
