# REBECCA'S PRIVATE IDAHO - RAW RESEARCH DUMP

## **OFFICIAL DATA**
* **Event & Location:** Rebecca’s Private Idaho (RPI) is a premier gravel cycling event held annually over Labor Day weekend in the Sun Valley area of Idaho, centered around Ketchum (elev. ~5,900 ft)<u>[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/x9c1rm/rebeccas_private_idaho/#:~:text=I%20traveled%20from%20Boston%20to,be%20going%20back%20next%20year)</u><u>[rebeccasprivateidaho.com](https://www.rebeccasprivateidaho.com/lodging-and-travel#:~:text=For%20those%20new%20to%20the,Bannock%20people)</u>.

RPI was founded in 2013 by professional cyclist Rebecca Rusch and has since grown into a multi-day gravel festival now capped at around 1,500 participants to maintain a friendly, community vibe<u>[velo.outsideonline.com](https://velo.outsideonline.com/road/road-racing/monuments-of-gravel-rebeccas-private-idaho?scope=anon#:~:text=The%20guest%20list%20at%20RPI,intimate%20gathering%20after%20the%20ride)</u><u>[velo.outsideonline.com](https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/haley-smith-and-payson-mcelveen-win-rebeccas-private-idaho-queens-stage-race/?scope=anon#:~:text=Haley%20Smith%20and%20Payson%20McElveen,Private%20Idaho%20Queen%E2%80%99s%20Stage%20Race)</u>.
* **Race Formats & Distances:** RPI offers four main ride options:
	* **“Baked Potato”** – ~100+ mile **gravel century** (approx 102–104 miles). This is the marquee one-day race (also the final stage of the stage race) featuring about **5,200–6,200 feet of climbing**<u>[velo.outsideonline.com](https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/rebeccas-private-idaho-introduces-two-new-categories-kicks-off-ninth-year/#:~:text=RPI%20boasts%20four%20different%20race,mile%20French%20Fry)</u><u>[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/x9c1rm/rebeccas_private_idaho/#:~:text=back%20next%20year)</u>. In recent editions the course length has been about 103 miles with ~6,200′ elevation gain (the official promo for 2023 was ~**103 miles / 6,200′** of climbing)<u>[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/x9c1rm/rebeccas_private_idaho/#:~:text=back%20next%20year)</u>. The course is a challenging loop/out-and-back over Trail Creek Summit and through the remote Copper Basin (details below).
	* **“French Fry”** – ~56-mile **half-century** gravel route, with roughly **3,700–4,000 feet** of climbing<u>[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/x9c1rm/rebeccas_private_idaho/#:~:text=%E2%80%A2)</u><u>[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/x9c1rm/rebeccas_private_idaho/#:~:text=I%20traveled%20from%20Boston%20to,be%20going%20back%20next%20year)</u>. This route typically goes out-and-back partway over Trail Creek Summit and skips the longest loop section.
	* **“Tater Tot”** – ~20-mile **introductory** gravel ride (around 19–20 miles)<u>[kavhelmets.com](https://kavhelmets.com/pages/rpi#:~:text=The%20winner%20will%20receive%20one,announced%20via%20email%20on%208%2F20%2F2022)</u>. A shorter out-and-back suitable for newer riders; minimal elevation gain (still includes the lower part of Trail Creek road, turning around at ~mile 8.5)<u>[rebeccasprivateidaho.com](https://www.rebeccasprivateidaho.com/faq#:~:text=Tater%20Tot%20Rest%20Stop%20will,5)</u>.
	* **“Queen’s Stage Race (QSR)”** – a **three-day stage race** (plus a rest day) totaling roughly **186–200 miles** over 4 days<u>[rebeccasprivateidaho.com](https://www.rebeccasprivateidaho.com/stages/day-4-queen-stage#:~:text=Experience%20the%20smashing%20climbs%2C%20stunning,the%20raw%20and%20varied%20terrain)</u><u>[cyclingnews.com](https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/rebeccas-private-idaho-sarah-max-and-griffin-easter-win-queens-stage-race/#:~:text=The%20three%20stages%20of%20the,scroll%20through%20the%20galleries%20too)</u>. The QSR includes three timed stages: Day 1 ~35-mile off-road “Harriman Trail” stage (singletrack & doubletrack), Day 2 a ~4–5 mile uphill time trial (with approach/return ride), and Day 3 the 100-mile Baked Potato gravel race<u>[velo.outsideonline.com](https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/rebeccas-private-idaho-introduces-two-new-categories-kicks-off-ninth-year/#:~:text=RPI%20boasts%20four%20different%20race,mile%20French%20Fry)</u><u>[velo.outsideonline.com](https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/haley-smith-and-payson-mcelveen-win-rebeccas-private-idaho-queens-stage-race/?scope=anon#:~:text=Haley%20Smith%20%20and%20,Race%20at%20Rebecca%E2%80%99s%20Private%20Idaho)</u>. Total elevation for the full stage race is on the order of **10,000–14,000 feet** (recent 2023 QSR: ~186 miles, 10,646′ gain<u>[cyclingnews.com](https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/rebeccas-private-idaho-sarah-max-and-griffin-easter-win-queens-stage-race/#:~:text=The%20three%20stages%20of%20the,scroll%20through%20the%20galleries%20too)</u>; earlier editions quoted ~200 miles, 14,300′)<u>[rebeccasprivateidaho.com](https://www.rebeccasprivateidaho.com/stages/day-4-queen-stage#:~:text=Experience%20the%20smashing%20climbs%2C%20stunning,the%20raw%20and%20varied%20terrain)</u>.
* **Elevation & Altitude:** The event is truly high-mountain gravel. Ketchum’s start/finish is just under **6,000 feet** above sea level<u>[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/x9c1rm/rebeccas_private_idaho/#:~:text=%E2%80%A2)</u>. The courses climb over **Trail Creek Summit (~7,900 ft)** as the high point<u>[topozone.com](https://www.topozone.com/idaho/custer-id/summit/trail-creek-summit-2/#:~:text=Trail%20Creek%20Summit%20Topo%20Map,Map%20Area%3A%20Rock%20Roll%20Canyon)</u>, and much of the route (Copper Basin, etc.) stays in the 6,000–7,500 ft range. This thin-air elevation means less oxygen for riders – a significant factor for those traveling from sea level (see “Altitude Impact” below). Total elevation gain for the big routes: ~6k feet on the 100mi, ~4k on the 56mi, ~1k on the 20mi<u>[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/x9c1rm/rebeccas_private_idaho/#:~:text=%E2%80%A2)</u><u>[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/x9c1rm/rebeccas_private_idaho/#:~:text=back%20next%20year)</u>.
* **Field Size:** RPI has grown but is deliberately limited to preserve its character. The **participant cap is ~1,500 riders** in total<u>[velo.outsideonline.com](https://velo.outsideonline.com/road/road-racing/monuments-of-gravel-rebeccas-private-idaho?scope=anon#:~:text=The%20guest%20list%20at%20RPI,intimate%20gathering%20after%20the%20ride)</u>.

* **Registration Cost:** As of mid-2020s, entry fees for RPI are in the mid-to-premium range:
	* The **100-mile “Baked Potato”** was about **$250** to register<u>[rebeccasprivateidaho.com](https://www.rebeccasprivateidaho.com/registration-pricing-info#:~:text=Stage%201%3A%C2%A0Harriman%20,118%20Miles%29%3A%20%24285)</u>.

	* The **20-mile “Tater Tot”** ~**$50** entry (aimed at accessibility for newcomers/families)<u>[rebeccasprivateidaho.com](https://www.rebeccasprivateidaho.com/registration-pricing-info#:~:text=Stage%201%3A%C2%A0Harriman%20,118%20Miles%29%3A%20%24285)</u>.
	* The **Queen’s Stage Race** full 3-day package was around **$495**<u>[rebeccasprivateidaho.com](https://www.rebeccasprivateidaho.com/registration-pricing-info#:~:text=Queen%20Stage%20Race%20)</u>. (Note: RPI offers tiered pricing for doing a “partial” stage race where riders can sign up for stage race but choose a shorter Sunday route, e.g. “Tatered” 104-mile total for $260, etc. – but the main full-gas QSR is ~$495)<u>[rebeccasprivateidaho.com](https://www.rebeccasprivateidaho.com/registration-pricing-info#:~:text=Queen%20Stage%20Race%20)</u>.
	* Group discounts are offered (bring 3+ riders and receive up to 20% off)<u>[rebeccasprivateidaho.com](https://www.rebeccasprivateidaho.com/register#:~:text=)</u><u>[rebeccasprivateidaho.com](https://www.rebeccasprivateidaho.com/registration-pricing-info#:~:text=Group%20Discounts%3A)</u>. Also juniors under 18 race free on the Sunday routes (and half-price for QSR) to encourage youth participation<u>[rebeccasprivateidaho.com](https://www.rebeccasprivateidaho.com/registration-pricing-info#:~:text=Junior%20Pricing%3A)</u>.
* **Terrain & Difficulty:** RPI is known as one of the original tough mountain gravel races in the US<u>[rebeccasprivateidaho.com](https://www.rebeccasprivateidaho.com/stages/day-4-queen-stage#:~:text=DAY%204%3A%20QUEEN%20STAGE%20,BAKED%C2%A0POTATO%C2%A0ROUTE)</u>. The event’s tagline highlights it as *“Idaho’s most beautiful gravel race”* but **“wasn’t made to be easy,”** as it’s Rebecca Rusch’s brainchild<u>[rebeccasprivateidaho.com](https://www.rebeccasprivateidaho.com/stages/day-4-queen-stage#:~:text=DAY%204%3A%20QUEEN%20STAGE%20,BAKED%C2%A0POTATO%C2%A0ROUTE)</u>. Expect long climbs, high altitude, and a mix of road surfaces (see “Terrain & Course” below). The marquee 100-mile route is considered a **gravel century “plus”** – in fact in early years it was ~92 miles<u>[velo.outsideonline.com](https://velo.outsideonline.com/tag/rebeccas-private-idaho/#:~:text=Gravel%20Dispatch%3A%20Happy%20solitude%20at,Rebecca%E2%80%99s%20Private%20Idaho)</u> but recent editions extended to ~100+ with a devilish extra section. Elevation profiles are demanding but not extreme (no ultra-steep 20% grades, but sustained climbs of 2,000+ ft). The difficulty also comes from **rugged gravel conditions** and potential weather (heat or storms). RPI has been recognized as a top-tier gravel event – it was on VeloNews’s shortlist for “Monuments of Gravel” due to its prestige and challenge<u>[velo.outsideonline.com](https://velo.outsideonline.com/road/road-racing/monuments-of-gravel-rebeccas-private-idaho?scope=anon#:~:text=This%20week%20we%20launched%20the,21%2C%20and%20SBT%20GRVL)</u><u>[velo.outsideonline.com](https://velo.outsideonline.com/road/road-racing/monuments-of-gravel-rebeccas-private-idaho?scope=anon#:~:text=As%20for%20the%20riding%2C%20RPI,mile%20French%20Fry)</u>.
* **Schedule:** The stage race portion typically runs Thursday through Sunday, with the one-day rides on Sunday. For example, in 2023: Stage 1 Thursday, Stage 2 Friday, (Saturday “rest or play” day with an optional charity ride), and Sunday was the big Baked/French Fry/Tater Tot rides + festival finish<u>[velo.outsideonline.com](https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/rebeccas-private-idaho-introduces-two-new-categories-kicks-off-ninth-year/#:~:text=For%20riders%20who%20truly%20want,miles%20of%20Sun%20Valley%20singletrack)</u>. The main **100mi Baked Potato race starts 8:00 AM Sunday** morning and riders are usually finishing throughout the afternoon<u>[rebeccasprivateidaho.com](https://www.rebeccasprivateidaho.com/stages/day-4-queen-stage#:~:text=SCHEDULE)</u>. There are cutoff times – e.g. riders had to reach mile 43 by 11:45am to be allowed onto the full Copper Basin loop<u>[rebeccasprivateidaho.com](https://www.rebeccasprivateidaho.com/stages/day-4-queen-stage#:~:text=Aid%20stations%20will%20be%20located,43%2C%2065%2C%20and%2076%2C%2091)</u><u>[rebeccasprivateidaho.com](https://www.rebeccasprivateidaho.com/stages/day-4-queen-stage#:~:text=You%20must%20make%20it%20to,onto%20the%20Copper%20Basin%20loop)</u> (otherwise they’re turned back early for safety).
* **Notable Traditions:** The event emphasizes camaraderie and fun as much as racing. Finishers get to **bang a giant gong** at the finish to send out good vibes<u>[eyeonsunvalley.com](https://eyeonsunvalley.com/Story_Reader/10917/Rebecca%E2%80%99s-Private-Idaho-Riders-Ignore-Showers,-Fog/#:~:text=Bicyclists%20wore%20big%20grins%20as,vibes%20out%20in%20the%20world)</u>. There are podium awards for a wide array of categories (including non-binary, para-cyclist, tandem, and even a special “Twice Baked” award for the final finisher who makes the cutoff – celebrating the last rider to tough it out)<u>[rebeccasprivateidaho.com](https://www.rebeccasprivateidaho.com/categories-and-awards#:~:text=First%20Place%20Tandem%20Baked%20Potato,Tandem%20French%20Fry)</u>. RPI also incorporates philanthropy (the Be Good™ Foundation charity, see below) and lots of festivities (expo, live music, awards party, etc., making it more than just a race).
## **TERRAIN & COURSE (with specific climbs)**
RPI’s courses showcase Idaho’s dramatic backcountry with a mix of **gravel roads, dirt double-track, and a dash of singletrack**. Riders experience everything from fast paved sections to teeth-chattering washboard gravel. Here’s a breakdown:
* **Course Overview:** The main **100-mile “Baked Potato” route** forms a large lollipop-shaped out-and-back. It **starts in Ketchum/Sun Valley’s Festival Meadow**, rolls out on pavement, then tackles the hallmark **Trail Creek Road climb** over Trail Creek Summit into the rugged Copper Basin area<u>[eyeonsunvalley.com](https://eyeonsunvalley.com/kiosk/Kiosk_Story?StoryId=13170&ScreenName=#:~:text=Wizz%20Wisenhant%20and%20Muffy%20Ritz%2C,before%20returning%20to%20Champions%20Meadow)</u>. Once over the summit, the route loops through remote valleys (Wildhorse and Copper Basin) on rocky dirt roads before returning back **over Trail Creek Summit** and descending to Ketchum. In total it’s ~103 miles “circling” back to the start<u>[eyeonsunvalley.com](https://eyeonsunvalley.com/kiosk/Kiosk_Story?StoryId=13170&ScreenName=#:~:text=Wizz%20Wisenhant%20and%20Muffy%20Ritz%2C,before%20returning%20to%20Champions%20Meadow)</u>. The **56-mile “French Fry”** uses the same Trail Creek pass but likely turns around earlier (skipping the farthest Copper Basin loop). The **20-mile “Tater Tot”** is an out-and-back on the lower part of Trail Creek Road (no full summit crossing). All courses share the initial climb and scenery of Trail Creek.
* **Trail Creek Summit Climb:** This is *the* defining climb of RPI. **Trail Creek Road** starts just outside Ketchum (elev ~5,840′) and ascends ~2,000 vertical feet to Trail Creek Summit (~7,880′) over ~12 milescyclepass.com. The climb averages around **6–7% grade**<u>[eyeonsunvalley.com](https://eyeonsunvalley.com/kiosk/Kiosk_Story?StoryId=13170&ScreenName=#:~:text=Rebecca%E2%80%99s%20Private%20Idaho%20is%20no,butter%20when%20you%E2%80%99re%20riding%20them)</u> – fairly steady – with some steeper pitches and countless washboard bumps. The first miles are paved, but once the road turns to gravel it gets **“chunky and OMG the washboards are horrible”** as one rider put it<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/rebeccas-private-idaho-and-qsr-2022/73589#:~:text=webdev511%20%20August%2025%2C%202022%2C,4%3A27pm%20%2014)</u>. It’s a high mountain pass with exposure: trees thin out near the top, and weather can turn quickly. Reaching the summit (which serves as a checkpoint/aid station) is a major accomplishment – riders earn “bragging rights” for conquering this burly climb<u>[rebeccasprivateidaho.com](https://www.rebeccasprivateidaho.com/#:~:text=Valley%20www,Trail%20Creek%20Summit%20climb)</u>. On the **descent** into Copper Basin, Trail Creek Road is a fast but rough downhill on gravel with sharp switchbacks and potential for two-way rider traffic<u>[rebeccasprivateidaho.com](https://www.rebeccasprivateidaho.com/stages/day-4-queen-stage#:~:text=Sections%20on%20the%20Baked%20Potato,way%20rider%20traffic)</u>. Braking bumps and loose corners keep you on your toes.
* **Copper Basin & “The Lollipop” Loop:** After descending Trail Creek into the **Copper Basin** – a remote high-altitude valley ringed by the Pioneer Mountains – the 100-mile route makes a lollipop-shaped loop on flat to rolling terrain. This area includes **Wildhorse Canyon** and **Copper Basin Loop Road** (Forest Roads 135/138). The terrain here is **open range** high desert: broad vistas, likely some grazing cattle and wild streams<u>[rebeccasprivateidaho.com](https://www.rebeccasprivateidaho.com/faq#:~:text=RPI%20Sun%20Valley%20very%20gratefully,may%20be%20on%20the%20course)</u><u>[rebeccasprivateidaho.com](https://www.rebeccasprivateidaho.com/faq#:~:text=Rest%20Stop%201%20,at%20miles%2012%20and%2090)</u>. The gravel ranges from hardpack to rocky sections. While there are no huge climbs in the basin, the route undulates and often riders face strong winds (more on that later). The course in 2023 had aid stations at ~mile 43 (Copper Basin) and mile 65 on this loop<u>[rebeccasprivateidaho.com](https://www.rebeccasprivateidaho.com/stages/day-4-queen-stage#:~:text=Aid%20stations%20will%20be%20located,43%2C%2065%2C%20and%2076%2C%2091)</u>. Notably, **at mile 81** on the return, the route hits the base of Trail Creek climb again – and that’s where the infamous **“El Diablito”** section begins<u>[rebeccasprivateidaho.com](https://www.rebeccasprivateidaho.com/stages/day-4-queen-stage#:~:text=Note%3A)</u>.
* **“El Diablito” Technical Section:** Spanish for “Little Devil,” *El Diablito* is a ~5-mile stretch of rough trail that was added to the Baked Potato course in recent years (introduced around 2018–2019 to spice things up)<u>[eyeonsunvalley.com](https://eyeonsunvalley.com/kiosk/Kiosk_Story?StoryId=13170&ScreenName=#:~:text=Little%20Devil%20is%20about%2080,Big%20Potato%20race%2C%20said%20Ritz)</u>. It branches off the main dirt road near Kane Creek around mile 80 of the 100-miler<u>[eyeonsunvalley.com](https://eyeonsunvalley.com/kiosk/Kiosk_Story?StoryId=13170&ScreenName=#:~:text=As%20if%20the%20riders%20who,%E2%80%9D)</u><u>[eyeonsunvalley.com](https://eyeonsunvalley.com/kiosk/Kiosk_Story?StoryId=13170&ScreenName=#:~:text=Who%20knew%20the%20devil%20wears,fashion%20footwear)</u>. This segment is **narrow, rocky double-track/jeep trail** winding through sagebrush slopes with some steep punchy ups and downs. Rebecca Rusch named it El Diablito “for the devilish technical aspect, but also the breathtaking views of Devil’s Bedstead” (a local peak)<u>[rebeccasprivateidaho.com](https://www.rebeccasprivateidaho.com/stages/day-4-queen-stage#:~:text=Note%3A)</u>. It **challenges riders’ MTB skills** – many find it tough and some must dismount in spots if they’re on skinnier tires or very fatigued. Two veteran RPI riders even dressed as red devils and stationed themselves at this section to cheer (or taunt) riders, underlining its reputation<u>[eyeonsunvalley.com](https://eyeonsunvalley.com/kiosk/Kiosk_Story?StoryId=13170&ScreenName=#:~:text=Wizz%20Wisenhant%20and%20Muffy%20Ritz%2C,before%20returning%20to%20Champions%20Meadow)</u><u>[eyeonsunvalley.com](https://eyeonsunvalley.com/kiosk/Kiosk_Story?StoryId=13170&ScreenName=#:~:text=%E2%80%9CIt%E2%80%99s%20a%20tough%20section%20that,to%20even%20crack%2C%20a%20smile%21%E2%80%9D)</u>! According to Rebecca, **“Little Devil” comes about 80 miles into the 103-mile race**<u>[eyeonsunvalley.com](https://eyeonsunvalley.com/kiosk/Kiosk_Story?StoryId=13170&ScreenName=#:~:text=Who%20knew%20the%20devil%20wears,fashion%20footwear)</u>. Strong riders have used El Diablito as a strategic attack point in races (e.g. pros often try to break away here)<u>[cyclingnews.com](https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/rebeccas-private-idaho-sarah-max-and-griffin-easter-win-queens-stage-race/#:~:text=,the%20race%20a%20true%20race)</u>. After El Diablito rejoins Trail Creek Road near the summit, all riders then face the second big climb: **ascending back up to Trail Creek Summit from the Copper Basin side** (a shorter but still significant climb) before the long descent back to the finish.
* **Surface Conditions:** The **gravel/dirt roads are generally **rough**, not well-groomed “champagne gravel.” Expect sections of washboard corrugation, loose gravel, embedded rocks, and maybe some sandy patches. One local report put it bluntly: the roads “don’t exactly feel like butter when you’re riding them”<u>[eyeonsunvalley.com](https://eyeonsunvalley.com/kiosk/Kiosk_Story?StoryId=13170&ScreenName=#:~:text=Rebecca%E2%80%99s%20Private%20Idaho%20is%20no,butter%20when%20you%E2%80%99re%20riding%20them)</u>. The event often reminds riders it’s a true adventure on **primarily National Forest roads**<u>[rebeccasprivateidaho.com](https://www.rebeccasprivateidaho.com/faq#:~:text=RPI%20Sun%20Valley%20very%20gratefully,may%20be%20on%20the%20course)</u> – meaning conditions can vary year to year based on maintenance and weather. Parts of Trail Creek and Copper Basin roads can be fast hardpack, but others are “chunky” enough that riders on gravel bikes have to pick lines carefully or even walk a tricky bit (especially if exhausted)<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/rebeccas-private-idaho-and-qsr-2022/73589#:~:text=Happy%20with%20the%20ramblers%2C%20but,right%20tire%20for%20the%20race)</u>. The addition of El Diablito ups the technical ante, bordering on mountain-bike terrain (sharp rocks, ruts, etc.). **Pavement:** There are small paved segments: e.g. the neutral start rollout through town, and some pavement in the first few miles up Trail Creek road before it turns to gravel<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/rebeccas-private-idaho-and-qsr-2022/73589#:~:text=webdev511%20%20August%2025%2C%202022%2C,4%3A27pm%20%2014)</u>. But the vast majority (~90+ miles) of the Baked Potato is on unpaved surfaces.
* **Other Climbs:** Aside from Trail Creek (climbed twice on the 100-miler, out-and-back), the main loop is mostly flat-ish. However, the **Wildhorse Canyon area** on FR 135 has a short climb and descent. French Fry riders (56 mi) likely go out to the **Wildhorse Creek junction** and turn around; they would climb Trail Creek once from the Ketchum side and once back from the far point. The **Harriman Trail** (Stage 1 of QSR) is a separate course north of Ketchum featuring ~35 miles of rolling singletrack and doubletrack through forest – described as “rad single and double-track beneath the Boulder Mountains”<u>[rebeccasprivateidaho.com](https://www.rebeccasprivateidaho.com/stages/day-1-harriman#:~:text=DAY%201%3A%20HARRIMAN%20TRAIL)</u>. Stage 2 (Dollarhide TT) climbs around 1,000′ over ~4.5 miles up Dollarhide Summit on gravel – essentially a short but steep hillclimb against the clock<u>[velo.outsideonline.com](https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/haley-smith-and-payson-mcelveen-win-rebeccas-private-idaho-queens-stage-race/?scope=anon#:~:text=The%20three,century%20to%20top%20it%20off)</u>. These stages are unique to QSR riders, whereas all Sunday riders tackle Trail Creek.
* **Scenery:** The terrain may be punishing, but it’s unquestionably beautiful. Riders are treated to panoramic views of the **Pioneer and Boulder Mountains**, wide-open skies, and the feeling of remote wilderness. Many sections run through the **Sawtooth National Recreation Area** and Salmon-Challis National Forest – truly “America’s wild west” scenery<u>[velo.outsideonline.com](https://velo.outsideonline.com/road/road-racing/monuments-of-gravel-rebeccas-private-idaho?scope=anon#:~:text=%E2%80%9CIt%E2%80%99s%20gorgeous%2C%20challenging%2C%20and%20helmed,%E2%80%9D)</u>. In the backdrop looms peaks like **Hyndman Peak (12,000′)** and even Idaho’s tallest, Mt. Borah, visible in the distance on clear days<u>[valleychamber.org](https://valleychamber.org/trail-creek-summit-creek-road/#:~:text=Trail%20Creek%20Road%20continues%20on,Borah%20%28)</u>. Gravel cyclists often rave that RPI’s course “shows off Ketchum and the surrounding mountains” better than almost any event<u>[velo.outsideonline.com](https://velo.outsideonline.com/road/road-racing/monuments-of-gravel-rebeccas-private-idaho?scope=anon#:~:text=performance%20and%20place)</u>. As one article put it, RPI combines **“stunning mountain scenery with a tough route and plenty of celebration once the 92-mile gravel race is over.”**<u>[velo.outsideonline.com](https://velo.outsideonline.com/tag/rebeccas-private-idaho/#:~:text=Gravel%20Dispatch%3A%20Happy%20solitude%20at,Rebecca%E2%80%99s%20Private%20Idaho)</u> In other words: come for the views, stay for the party (once you survive the course!).
## **ALTITUDE IMPACT**
One of the biggest challenges of RPI is the **high elevation**. The entire event takes place around 6,000–8,000 feet above sea level, which has profound effects on performance:
* **Thin Air, Lower Oxygen:** At ~6,000–8,000 ft, air pressure is much lower than at sea level, meaning each breath delivers significantly less oxygen. Even fit riders will notice heavier breathing and higher heart rates for a given effort. The start in Ketchum (~5,888′) already puts you at altitude<u>[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/x9c1rm/rebeccas_private_idaho/#:~:text=I%20traveled%20from%20Boston%20to,be%20going%20back%20next%20year)</u>, and by the time you crest Trail Creek Summit (~7,900′) you’re at an elevation that can really sap your power. Sea-level athletes often feel a 5–15% drop in power output at these heights. As one prospective racer from the East Coast correctly suspected, you can’t directly compare RPI to a similar-distance ride back home at low altitude – *“the altitude... offers more than enough challenge”* on top of the distance and climbing<u>[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/x9c1rm/rebeccas_private_idaho/#:~:text=Thanks,offer%20more%20than%20enough%20challenge)</u>.
* **Acclimatization:** Many riders traveling to RPI plan to arrive a few days early to acclimate. There is anecdotal evidence that a short acclimation helps – e.g. a rider from Boston noted they came to Sun Valley on Thursday, did some easy recon rides, and “had no problems with the altitude – just the freakin’ headwinds!”<u>[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/x9c1rm/rebeccas_private_idaho/#:~:text=The%20,of%20vert)</u>. Others spend even longer (one stage racer spent 10 days at 6,000′ beforehand)<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/rebeccas-private-idaho-and-qsr-2022/73589#:~:text=webdev511%20%20August%2024%2C%202022%2C,3%3A32pm%20%2013)</u>. If you can’t arrive early, just be prepared to dial back your pace especially on the first climb, as you **will** go into the red more quickly at 7,000+ ft. Hydration is also crucial since high-altitude air is very dry.
* **Altitude vs. Performance:** Riders uniformly mention that altitude is a key factor in RPI’s difficulty. A past participant in multiple gravel 100-milers said *“Rebecca’s is wildly more difficult than the others I’ve done”* in part due to the conditions – and this was on a year with heat and dust too<u>[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/x9c1rm/rebeccas_private_idaho/#:~:text=%E2%80%A2)</u>. The high elevation amplifies the strain of the climbs: climbing 4,000 ft at 7,000′ feels harder than the same climb at sea level. Even the **“French Fry” 56-miler has over 3,700′ of vertical** and starts near 6k ft<u>[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/x9c1rm/rebeccas_private_idaho/#:~:text=%E2%80%A2)</u>, so shorter-distance riders aren’t spared. In short, the altitude makes every climb and even flat sections more taxing – your threshold power is lower, recovery is slower, and dehydration hits faster.
* **Summit Conditions:** At nearly 8,000 ft, Trail Creek Summit can bring weather/air issues too. Sun exposure is more intense (UV is stronger at altitude), and if wildfire season is active, smoke can affect air quality at these elevations (in 2022, wildfire smoke blew into the area causing hot, dusty conditions)<u>[eyeonsunvalley.com](https://eyeonsunvalley.com/Story_Reader/10917/Rebecca%E2%80%99s-Private-Idaho-Riders-Ignore-Showers,-Fog/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CIt%20was%20great,%E2%80%9D)</u>. In 2024, RPI even had to **cancel Stage 1** due to unhealthy smoke from a nearby fire – a reminder that altitude and environment are intertwined challenges<u>[rebeccasprivateidaho.com](https://www.rebeccasprivateidaho.com/dispatches/2024-post-event-wrap-up#:~:text=We%20didn%27t%20have%20much%20of,year%20history)</u>.
* **Tips:** Many riders “wish they knew” just how much altitude would affect them. Some practical takeaways:
	* Arrive as early as possible to get used to the thin air<u>[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/x9c1rm/rebeccas_private_idaho/#:~:text=The%20,of%20vert)</u>.
	* Stay hydrated and mind your nutrition – high, dry air can dehydrate you quickly.
	* Use lower gearing than you normally might; you’ll appreciate the easier gear when grinding up a climb breathing through a straw.
	* Don’t be overconfident if you’re a strong rider at sea level – even elite pros feel the difference in oxygen. Pace yourself, especially in the first hour.
	* If possible, **pre-ride part of the course** (even just the first climb) to gauge how you feel at elevation. One racer who arrived early noted they made a point to “climb Trail Creek at least once this week” before race day as a check and to adjust equipment<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/rebeccas-private-idaho-and-qsr-2022/73589#:~:text=Just%20arrived%20in%20Ketchum%20after,first%20day%20of%20the%20QSR)</u>.
In summary, RPI’s altitude is a great equalizer – come prepared to respect it. As riders joked, **“it might look easy on paper by sea-level standards, but it’s not apples to apples.”**<u>[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/x9c1rm/rebeccas_private_idaho/#:~:text=Thanks,offer%20more%20than%20enough%20challenge)</u>
## **WEATHER HISTORY (September in Idaho)**
Early September in the mountains of Idaho is generally late-summer with a hint of fall – it can be gorgeous, but also unpredictable. **Historical climate data for Ketchum in September** shows:
* **Average highs** around **68–72 °F (20–22 °C)** and **average lows** around **33–38 °F (1–3 °C)**<u>[extremeweatherwatch.com](https://www.extremeweatherwatch.com/cities/ketchum/month-september#:~:text=Typical%20Ketchum%20September%20Weather%201991%E2%80%932020,12)</u>. So days are mild to warm, but nights (and early race morning) can be quite chilly.
* **Precipitation:** September is relatively dry, averaging only ~0.7 inches of rain in the month<u>[extremeweatherwatch.com](https://www.extremeweatherwatch.com/cities/ketchum/month-september#:~:text=Typical%20Ketchum%20September%20Weather%201991%E2%80%932020,12)</u>. However, scattered afternoon thunderstorms or showers can occur ~14% of days<u>[extremeweatherwatch.com](https://www.extremeweatherwatch.com/cities/ketchum/month-september#:~:text=Average%20monthly%20precipitation%200,12)</u>. Snow is rare but *not* unheard of at higher elevations in early September (historical record: a freak 3” snow on Sept 18, 1978 in Ketchum!)<u>[extremeweatherwatch.com](https://www.extremeweatherwatch.com/cities/ketchum/month-september#:~:text=Coldest%20average%20high%20temperature%20,5%20inches%201954)</u> – though RPI weekend has not seen snow, it’s wise to pack layers just in case in the mountains.
The conditions during RPI have varied year to year:
* **2022 (10th Annual RPI):** A notably **hot and dry year.** Temperatures soared into the 80s °F with intense sun and accumulated dust on course. Additionally, forest fire smoke impacted air quality – Rebecca Rusch remarked 2023 was “much better than last year with the heat, the dust and the smoke from wildfires”<u>[eyeonsunvalley.com](https://eyeonsunvalley.com/Story_Reader/10917/Rebecca%E2%80%99s-Private-Idaho-Riders-Ignore-Showers,-Fog/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CIt%20was%20great,%E2%80%9D)</u>. Many riders in 2022 struggled with dehydration and cramping due to the heat (one said it was so hot they cramped and had to walk part of the way)<u>[eyeonsunvalley.com](https://eyeonsunvalley.com/Story_Reader/10917/Rebecca%E2%80%99s-Private-Idaho-Riders-Ignore-Showers,-Fog/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWhen%20it%20began%20to%20rain%2C,%E2%80%9D)</u>. No rain fell that weekend, making for fast but very dusty conditions (and spectacularly dirty riders at the finish).
* **2023:** In contrast, **cooler and wetter**. RPI 2023 riders faced off-and-on **rain showers, fog, and cool temps** on race day<u>[eyeonsunvalley.com](https://eyeonsunvalley.com/Story_Reader/10917/Rebecca%E2%80%99s-Private-Idaho-Riders-Ignore-Showers,-Fog/#:~:text=Nearly%20900%20riders%20from%20throughout,rides%20up%20Trail%20Creek%20Summit)</u><u>[eyeonsunvalley.com](https://eyeonsunvalley.com/Story_Reader/10917/Rebecca%E2%80%99s-Private-Idaho-Riders-Ignore-Showers,-Fog/#:~:text=The%20race%E2%80%99s%20elite%20encountered%20a,was%20occasionally%20shrouded%20in%20fog)</u>. While getting rained on in a long gravel race is tough, most welcomed it: the light rain kept dust down and the air cool (~60s°F). There were a “couple 15-minute bouts of rain” that made things muddy but “temperatures were good” – significantly more comfortable than the prior year’s heat<u>[eyeonsunvalley.com](https://eyeonsunvalley.com/Story_Reader/10917/Rebecca%E2%80%99s-Private-Idaho-Riders-Ignore-Showers,-Fog/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWhen%20it%20began%20to%20rain%2C,%E2%80%9D)</u><u>[eyeonsunvalley.com](https://eyeonsunvalley.com/Story_Reader/10917/Rebecca%E2%80%99s-Private-Idaho-Riders-Ignore-Showers,-Fog/#:~:text=The%20race%E2%80%99s%20elite%20encountered%20a,was%20occasionally%20shrouded%20in%20fog)</u>. Some donned rain jackets and even shower caps under helmets during the brief downpours<u>[eyeonsunvalley.com](https://eyeonsunvalley.com/Story_Reader/10917/Rebecca%E2%80%99s-Private-Idaho-Riders-Ignore-Showers,-Fog/#:~:text=But%20Hailey%20resident%20Lucy%20Bourret,ride%20over%20Labor%20Day%20Weekend)</u>! By afternoon the sun peeked out. Riders noted they “warmed up on the climb up Trail Creek” despite getting wet, and many finished with big smiles despite mud-speckled faces<u>[eyeonsunvalley.com](https://eyeonsunvalley.com/Story_Reader/10917/Rebecca%E2%80%99s-Private-Idaho-Riders-Ignore-Showers,-Fog/#:~:text=which%20stung%20the%20face%20and,was%20occasionally%20shrouded%20in%20fog)</u><u>[eyeonsunvalley.com](https://eyeonsunvalley.com/Story_Reader/10917/Rebecca%E2%80%99s-Private-Idaho-Riders-Ignore-Showers,-Fog/#:~:text=Hailey%20resident%20Lindy%20Cogan%2C%20a,wool%20clothing%20dried%20out%20quickly)</u>.
* **2024:** A challenging start – Stage 1 was canceled due to wildfire smoke (air quality) earlier in the week<u>[rebeccasprivateidaho.com](https://www.rebeccasprivateidaho.com/dispatches/2024-post-event-wrap-up#:~:text=We%20didn%27t%20have%20much%20of,year%20history)</u>. By the main event days, the weather cleared and RPI 2024 ended up being “the best experience” yet according to organizers<u>[rebeccasprivateidaho.com](https://www.rebeccasprivateidaho.com/dispatches/2024-post-event-wrap-up#:~:text=Boulder%20Mountains%20as%20a%20result,year%20history)</u>. This underscores that **wildfire season** (late summer) can be an external factor; some years the skies are crystal clear, other years there might be haze from distant fires.
* **General:** Mornings in Sun Valley can be brisk (down in the 40s °F or even 30s at start time). But it usually warms up fast when the sun rises over the mountains. **Dress in layers** – you might start with arm warmers or a vest for the chill, then shed them by mid-morning. *Be prepared for swings*: in one day you might experience near freezing dawn, hot sunshine, then an afternoon thunderstorm.
**Typical Day Forecast:** At the start of September, sunrise in Ketchum is ~7 am. Start-line temps can be ~40–45 °F (7 °C) at 8:00 am. By afternoon it often reaches mid-70s °F (24 °C) on a clear day. There’s always a chance of an afternoon shower or gusty winds, especially over the pass. The high mountains can generate sudden weather – a sunny morning can turn to brief hail on Trail Creek Summit if a mountain storm pops up (so a light rain jacket in your saddle bag is cheap insurance).
**Summary:** Historically, **Idaho in early September is dry and pleasant**, but RPI riders have seen everything from **hot, dusty 85 °F days to mud-spattered 55 °F slogs**. Check the forecast before packing: you’ll likely want sunscreen and a hydration pack *and* a rain shell and thermal jersey. As veteran riders noted, *“we were so grateful there was no dust [in the rain year]… I loved it!”*<u>[eyeonsunvalley.com](https://eyeonsunvalley.com/Story_Reader/10917/Rebecca%E2%80%99s-Private-Idaho-Riders-Ignore-Showers,-Fog/#:~:text=Hailey%20resident%20Lindy%20Cogan%2C%20a,wool%20clothing%20dried%20out%20quickly)</u> – so any weather can be a plus or minus. Plan for both heat and cold, because in the mountains you might get both in one weekend.
## **REDDIT THREADS**
Discussions on Reddit (r/gravelcycling and others) provide valuable first-hand insights from amateur participants. Here are some highlights and exact quotes from Redditors about RPI:
* **Course Difficulty & Headwinds:** One consistent theme was surprise at the *difficulty*, even for experienced gravel riders. In a 2022 thread, a finisher wrote: *“having done 5 different 100-mile gravel races this year, I gotta say Rebecca’s is* ***wildly more difficult*** *than the others I’ve done. The headwind, heat, and extra dust this year just made it even more special.”*<u>[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/x9c1rm/rebeccas_private_idaho/#:~:text=%E2%80%A2)</u> Many riders mentioned a brutal **headwind** on the return leg in the Copper Basin. For instance: *“Beautiful course but tough headwind the last 20 or so miles.”*<u>[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/x9c1rm/rebeccas_private_idaho/#:~:text=%E2%80%A2)</u> and others echoed *“That headwind was* ***brutal*** *and just seemed to get worse and worse. I did the baked potato and was limping the last 6 miles.”*<u>[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/x9c1rm/rebeccas_private_idaho/#:~:text=ComprehensiveCase472)</u>. It seems the afternoon wind funneling down the valley often hits riders as they grind back toward Trail Creek and home. One rider admitted they didn’t expect it: *“Didn’t expect the headwind at all. I was hot, tired and almost out of water after the first hour of riding into the wind…”*<u>[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/x9c1rm/rebeccas_private_idaho/#:~:text=gfy_friday)</u>. (They actually stopped to dunk in a stream to cool off, which they say was the “best decision ever”<u>[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/x9c1rm/rebeccas_private_idaho/#:~:text=gfy_friday)</u>!)
* **Altitude and Climbing (from a Reddit Q&A):** A user asked about RPI’s elevation profile and impact on someone from the east coast. The community replied with concrete numbers: *“I believe the start is just under 6000 feet. They advertise over 4000 ft of climbing for the 56 mile route… I’m not sure about the longer route.”*<u>[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/x9c1rm/rebeccas_private_idaho/#:~:text=%E2%80%A2)</u> Another chimed in with their recorded data: *“Garmin tells me the start is @* ***5888′****, and I recorded total vertical of* ***3976′*** *for my [56-mile] ride. The ~103 mile course is promoted to have around* ***6200′ of vert****.”*<u>[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/x9c1rm/rebeccas_private_idaho/#:~:text=others%20have%20stated%2C%20this%20was,be%20going%20back%20next%20year)</u>. As for acclimatization, a Redditor from Boston said: *“we arrived in Sun Valley on Thursday, did a couple of recon rides and had no problems with the altitude – just the freakin’ headwinds!”*<u>[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/x9c1rm/rebeccas_private_idaho/#:~:text=The%20,of%20vert)</u>. This implies altitude is manageable with a little prep, but you can’t ignore it (as discussed in Altitude Impact).
* **Scenery and Experience:** Many comments simply marveled at the Idaho scenery and the vibe: *“That just looks awesome. Way different than Florida backroads gravel.”* (comment by a Floridian seeing RPI photos)<u>[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/x9c1rm/rebeccas_private_idaho/#:~:text=)</u>. Another user posted pride in finishing the 50-mile “Small Fry” and people responded with congrats and remarks about the beauty of the course (one called it *“sooo fun”* looking<u>[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/x9c1rm/rebeccas_private_idaho/#:~:text=%E2%80%A2)</u>). The consensus is that the **course is stunningly beautiful** but demands respect.
* **Rebecca Rusch’s Presence:** While not directly from Reddit, it’s worth noting via social media: many riders mention how Rebecca Rusch (the founder) is very much present during the event – cheering, giving out high-fives, etc. A VeloNews piece shared on Reddit highlighted *“Rebecca Rusch is a constant source of encouragement at RPI”*<u>[velo.outsideonline.com](https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/haley-smith-and-payson-mcelveen-win-rebeccas-private-idaho-queens-stage-race/?scope=anon#:~:text=second%20every%20day)</u>, with photos of her literally on course motivating riders. This lines up with riders feeling that RPI has a personal touch (it’s not often you get the event founder, who happens to be a world-class athlete, handing you a bottle or shouting your name mid-race!).
* **Community Tips (Camping and Logistics):** In r/SunValley, someone asked about camping for RPI. The advice given was: *“Don’t even stress, there will be tons of dispersed camping in every direction. Trail Creek, Lake Creek, West Warm Springs, SNRA… all have at least some spots.”*<u>[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/SunValley/comments/1evjgp1/rebeccas_private_idaho_camping/#:~:text=Rebecca%27s%20Private%20Idaho%20,will%20all%20have%20at)</u> Locals basically said not to bother with the official campgrounds (full on Labor Day) but to explore forest roads for free camping (more on logistics later). This shows how Reddit can supplement official info with real-world tips.
* **Out-of-State Race Recommendations:** In one thread asking for recommended out-of-state gravel races, RPI frequently came up alongside events like Oregon Trail. Users cited RPI’s reputation: multi-day option, great organization, and “awesome setting.” One poster summarized it in a *“bucket list gravel races”* discussion: *“The Rift is bucket list for sure. Mid South 100, Big Sugar, Rebecca’s Private Idaho…”*<u>[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/nxqn07/bucket_list_gravel_races/#:~:text=Bucket%20List%20Gravel%20Races%20%3A,of%20course%20the%20Tour%20Divide)</u> – putting RPI in the elite company of must-do events.
In summary, Redditors confirm that **RPI’s beauty comes with a beast of a course**. Altitude and headwinds are common refrains (“harder than expected”), but so are accolades for the scenery and event vibe. Perhaps the best endorsement: multiple riders said despite the suffering, they were “already planning for next year!”<u>[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/x9c1rm/rebeccas_private_idaho/#:~:text=%E2%80%A2)</u>. The mix of pain and joy seems to epitomize the RPI experience, as told by those who have been in the saddle and lived to post about it.
## **TRAINERROAD FORUM**
The TrainerRoad community (forum.trainerroad.com) has a dedicated thread for RPI (especially the 2022 Queen’s Stage Race), which offers detailed insights on equipment choices, course recon, and strategy from serious amateur racers. Key points from that discussion:
* **Tire Selection & Bike Setup:** RPI’s mixed surfaces sparked lots of debate on the forum. One Stage Race participant laid out his plan for different stages:
	* *Day 1 (Harriman singletrack stage):* Run bigger, more aggressive tires (45–50c) because “Stage 1 is the most tech. Perhaps run a 45 or 50c more aggressive tire,” since it’s “like a MTB race” with real singletrack<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/rebeccas-private-idaho-and-qsr-2022/73589#:~:text=My%20current%20thoughts%2C%20based%20largely,off%20the%20course%20previews%2C%20are)</u><u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/rebeccas-private-idaho-and-qsr-2022/73589#:~:text=jamesdanielosborne%20%20August%2011%2C%202022%2C,8%3A13pm%20%206)</u>.
	* *Day 2 (Time Trial climb):* Use fast-rolling smaller tires, even semi-slicks, to save weight/rolling resistance on the 4.5-mile uphill<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/rebeccas-private-idaho-and-qsr-2022/73589#:~:text=%2A%20Day%201%20,fit%20for%20mixed%20training%20rides)</u>.
	* *Day 3 (Rest day or fun ride).**Day 4 (Baked Potato 100mi):* Needs an all-round tire – some pavement, lots of gravel, one very chunky section. The consensus was **40–45c gravel tires are ideal**. One experienced RPI racer responded: *“I ran* ***40c Maxxis Ramblers*** *at the QSR and thought they were perfect. There is one slow chunky section but overall the gravel is very fast.”*<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/rebeccas-private-idaho-and-qsr-2022/73589#:~:text=jamesdanielosborne%20%20August%2011%2C%202022%2C,8%3A13pm%20%206)</u>. (Notably, those 40c Ramblers are exactly what Rebecca Rusch herself often recommends – the RPI FAQ even says *“Go as big as will fit!... [Maxxis] Rambler EXOs are Rebecca’s go-to.”*<u>[rebeccasprivateidaho.com](https://www.rebeccasprivateidaho.com/faq#:~:text=A%3A%20Go%20as%20big%20as,EXOs%20are%20Rebecca%27s%20go%20to)</u>.)
* Some Stage Race riders even brought **two wheelsets** to swap tires between stages<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/rebeccas-private-idaho-and-qsr-2022/73589#:~:text=I%E2%80%99m%20bringing%202%20sets%20of,because%20I%E2%80%99m%20looking%20to%20survive)</u>. For example, one used 40mm WTB Nanos on alloy wheels for the techy Stage1, then lighter 43mm GravelKing SK+ on carbon wheels for the TT and the Baked Potato<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/rebeccas-private-idaho-and-qsr-2022/73589#:~:text=I%E2%80%99m%20bringing%202%20sets%20of,because%20I%E2%80%99m%20looking%20to%20survive)</u>. They also mention using tire inserts (Cushcore/Airliners) to prevent flats on rocky parts and even using a **dropper post** on Stage 1 to handle the singletrack better<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/rebeccas-private-idaho-and-qsr-2022/73589#:~:text=Day%201%20MTB%20Race,because%20I%E2%80%99m%20looking%20to%20survive)</u>. Important: QSR rules required using the *same bike* across all stages (no swapping to a mountain bike for Stage1), but you can change wheels and tires<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/rebeccas-private-idaho-and-qsr-2022/73589#:~:text=webdev511%20%20August%2012%2C%202022%2C,2%3A03am%20%2011)</u>.
* In summary, the forum consensus was 
* **~40-45 mm tubeless gravel tires** are the sweet spot for the main course – enough volume for comfort and sand, but not overly heavy. A few riders have done the 100-miler on hardtail MTBs or fat bikes (RPI says ~25% of riders use mountain bikes)<u>[rebeccasprivateidaho.com](https://www.rebeccasprivateidaho.com/faq#:~:text=A%3A%20Yes%21%20About%2025,%E2%80%8D)</u>, which is allowed, but most agree a gravel bike with big tires is faster if you can handle it. One person noted *“I never bought a gravel bike so I’ll be doing the Baked Potato on my XC MTB”*<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/rebeccas-private-idaho-and-qsr-2022/73589#:~:text=ddavew%20%20August%2012%2C%202022%2C,12%3A37am%20%209)</u> – which Rusch’s team says is fine, just stick some fast-rolling 1.8” tires on it to reduce drag<u>[rebeccasprivateidaho.com](https://www.rebeccasprivateidaho.com/faq#:~:text=A%3A%20Yes%21%20About%2025,%E2%80%8D)</u>.
* **Gearing:** TrainerRoad users after recon were very vocal about gearing. The climbs aren’t super steep, but combined with altitude and fatigue, a **low gear is crucial**. One wrote after riding Trail Creek: *“11-32 cassette isn’t going to cut it. Minimum 11-34, maybe 11-36.”*<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/rebeccas-private-idaho-and-qsr-2022/73589#:~:text=1,bars%20are%20way%20too%20narrow)</u> They also mentioned using SRAM AXS Wide sub-compact gearing (43/30 chainrings with a 10-36 cassette), which provided “plenty of low end for the climbs but still quick enough on flats”<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/rebeccas-private-idaho-and-qsr-2022/73589#:~:text=I%20run%20AXS%20wide%20so,buddy%20who%20is%20a%20better)</u>. In short, don’t overestimate your strength – bring climbing gears. A 1:1 ratio or lower is recommended (e.g., 34 front, 36 rear). Better to spin than grind at 7,500 ft.
* **Washboard & Tire Pressure:** A big “lesson learned” from a TR user’s recon ride: *“When Trail Creek goes gravel it’s kinda chunky and OMG* ***the washboards are horrible****.”*<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/rebeccas-private-idaho-and-qsr-2022/73589#:~:text=webdev511%20%20August%2025%2C%202022%2C,4%3A27pm%20%2014)</u> This led to tip #1: **“Lower tire pressure. Like LOTS lower. I’m thinking so low it feels uncomfortable on the tarmac.”*<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/rebeccas-private-idaho-and-qsr-2022/73589#:~:text=1,36)</u>. That’s a useful insight – many riders start with high pressure for speed on pavement, but for RPI it’s wise to err on the side of softer tires to absorb chatter. With tubeless tires, you can safely run pressures in the 30-40 psi range for 40c tires (depending on rider weight). The long stretches of washboard on Trail Creek and other roads will beat you up if you’re over-inflated. So, as the TR forum suggests, better to tolerate a bit of squish on the brief pavement than to rattle your eyeballs out on the gravel.
* **Recon Feedback:** A rider who arrived early shared real-time recon: *“A lot more tarmac than I expected, but when Trail Creek goes gravel it’s chunky... Lessons learned: (1) tire pressure down, (2) need bigger cassette, (3) 400mm [narrow] bars are too narrow [for controlling on rough terrain].”*<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/rebeccas-private-idaho-and-qsr-2022/73589#:~:text=webdev511%20%20August%2025%2C%202022%2C,4%3A27pm%20%2014)</u>. They didn’t make it over the backside in their pre-ride but used the climb for training intervals. Another asked about the **descent condition**: “how are the washboards on the long stretch after the climb?”<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/rebeccas-private-idaho-and-qsr-2022/73589#:~:text=ciarrai%20%20August%2025%2C%202022%2C,4%3A57pm%20%2015)</u> – implying the **backside descent** into Copper Basin also has washboard sections. So prepare for bumpy downhill action too.
* **Stage Race Specifics:** Stage 1 is basically a **MTB-style stage** – riders discuss whether a hardtail MTB might actually be better. It was clarified you must use the same bike all weekend, and apparently most still use gravel bikes (perhaps with a suspension fork or dropper if desired)<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/rebeccas-private-idaho-and-qsr-2022/73589#:~:text=jamesdanielosborne%20%20August%2012%2C%202022%2C,1%3A25am%20%2010)</u>. The fact that Stage1 has “an hour plus of singletrack” means gravel bikes are pushed to their limits (Haley Smith, who won in 2022, even took a wrong turn on singletrack but still won)<u>[velo.outsideonline.com](https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/haley-smith-and-payson-mcelveen-win-rebeccas-private-idaho-queens-stage-race/?scope=anon#:~:text=Leadville%20Trail%20100,leads%20the%20Grand%20Prix%20series)</u>. Stage2 (TT) is short enough that some literally swapped to “skinny slicks” for that day<u>[velo.outsideonline.com](https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/haley-smith-and-payson-mcelveen-win-rebeccas-private-idaho-queens-stage-race/?scope=anon#:~:text=On%20stage%202%2C%20she%20completed,%E2%80%9D)</u>. So the TR forum highlight: **adaptability** – RPI throws various terrains at you, so set up your bike to handle the worst of it (rough trails, steep loose climbs) rather than optimizing purely for the smooth bits.
In essence, TrainerRoad users conclude: **40-45mm durable tires, low gearing, comfy wide handlebars, dropper post if you have one, and run lower pressure than you think** – those are winning moves. And if you have the ability to pre-ride or simulate the conditions (like do some washboard gravel training), do it. As one said after testing equipment: *“I’ll likely chime in how it worked… See y’all there next week.”*<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/rebeccas-private-idaho-and-qsr-2022/73589#:~:text=how%20the%20washboards%20are%20on,the%20tarmac%20and%20gravel%20combo)</u> – the level of planning shows how seriously riders take this event.
## **YOUTUBE RACE REPORTS**
There are several great **YouTube videos and vlogs** covering Rebecca’s Private Idaho – both from Rebecca Rusch’s team and from participants. These provide a visual feel for the race. Notable examples:
* **Official Recap Videos (Rebecca Rusch’s channel):** Rebecca publishes recap highlights each year. For instance, **“2022 REBECCA’S PRIVATE IDAHO – FULL STORY”** is a ~17-minute video on her YouTube channel<u>[youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgq4yM87OmQ#:~:text=Thank%20you%20for%20your%20support%21,7K)</u>. It shows sweeping drone shots of riders climbing Trail Creek, cattle grazing by the roadside, and finish-line celebrations. Rusch’s videos often emphasize the community: shots of riders of all ages and bikes, volunteers at aid stations, and the festival atmosphere at the finish (live music, finishers ringing the gong, etc.). The 2022 recap in particular highlights how *tough* that year was – you see dust-covered, salt-crusted riders grinding slowly but resolutely. It’s a testament to the “Queen of Pain’s” mantra that *“it wasn’t made to be easy”*. These official videos are excellent to understand the **course visuals** and the **emotional journey** (from nervous smiles at the start to exhausted joy at the finish).
* **Course Previews by Rusch:** In 2023, Rebecca released short “Course Preview” videos for each stage (e.g. **“RPI 2023 QSR Stage 1 Preview”**). In those, she actually rides sections of the course with a GoPro, giving commentary like an insider guide. For example, for Stage1 she calls it *“the adventure stage because it’s unlike anything you’ll do on a gravel bike”*<u>[youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQvlWpMEMfY#:~:text=COURSE%20PREVIEW%20,You%20can%20also%20keep)</u> – showing the rocky singletrack. For the main Baked Potato, she points out key sections (trail junctions, etc.) and gives tips on line choice and pacing. These videos (hosted on her channel) are gold for anyone racing, as you literally see what the trail looks like around each bend.
* **Participant Vlogs:** A few amateur racers have uploaded their RPI experiences. Searching “Rebecca’s Private Idaho race report” yields some hits:
	* One example is a video titled *“RPI 2018 – An Event for Everyone”* on YouTube<u>[youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTFFc__Gflk#:~:text=Rebecca%27s%20Private%20Idaho%20Highlight%202019,weekend%20celebration%20with%20a)</u>. It interviews riders at the finish, including pros and recreational riders, all praising the event’s inclusiveness (the quote “an event for everyone” is apt, as RPI deliberately has routes for all levels).
	* Another example: **Cycling Strong** (a YouTube channel) posted an **exclusive interview with the 2013 RPI winner Burke Swindlehurst**<u>[youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/user/cyclingstrong#:~:text=Cycling%20Strong%20,Private%20Idaho%20Winner%3A%20Burke%20Swindlehurst)</u><u>[youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTZ3OUIgCDA#:~:text=Exclusive%20Interview%20with%20Rebecca%27s%20Private,Rebecca)</u>. This is from the inaugural year, but interesting historically – Burke describes the course and how it felt to win the first edition.
	* A newer vlog in 2023 by a junior rider Edyn (who was 14) on the Rodeo Labs channel followed his experience in the QSR. He documented each stage’s feel – e.g. Stage1 being rough for him, Stage2 TT efforts, and Stage3 the long grind. It’s inspirational to see a young rider take on RPI, and he notes how supportive the community was even though he was racing adults. (This aligns with RPI’s inclusive ethos – juniors race free, etc.)
* **Highlights to Watch For:** These YouTube clips often show iconic moments like:
	* *The neutral roll-out:* It starts with hundreds of riders rolling out of town behind a police escort, with scenic Sun Valley vistas ahead.
	* *The Trail Creek Climb:* Many videos capture the switch from pavement to dirt – suddenly dust kicking up, riders shifting to easy gears. You’ll see pain faces and some walking near the top in certain cases.
	* *Devil’s Corner (El Diablito):* The official 2025 Eye On Sun Valley video showed the costumed “devils” running alongside riders on the Little Devil section, which is both funny and indicative of rider suffering 80 miles in<u>[eyeonsunvalley.com](https://eyeonsunvalley.com/kiosk/Kiosk_Story?StoryId=13170&ScreenName=#:~:text=Little%20Devil%20is%20about%2080,Big%20Potato%20race%2C%20said%20Ritz)</u>.
	* *Finish Line & Festival:* The end of these videos usually shows the finish at Festival Meadows (or “Champion’s Meadow” as one article called it<u>[eyeonsunvalley.com](https://eyeonsunvalley.com/kiosk/Kiosk_Story?StoryId=13170&ScreenName=#:~:text=Wizz%20Wisenhant%20and%20Muffy%20Ritz%2C,before%20returning%20to%20Champions%20Meadow)</u>). Riders cross under the arch, then ring the gong. You’ll see beer tents, food trucks, live bands, and Rebecca giving hugs at the line. In one recap, finishers immediately got a cowboy hat and bolo tie (past finisher awards), which they donned for a finisher photo – very Idaho-esque.
* **Rebecca’s Perspective:** Rusch often appears in her videos either narrating or on the bike. She makes a point that RPI is about *“hometown hospitality”* and sharing her backyard. For example, she’s filmed riding alongside a para-cyclist handcyclist (Josh Sweeney) during the race, chatting and encouraging – demonstrating how she engages with participants of all abilities<u>[youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/@adventurescoutmedia#:~:text=ADVENTURE%20SCOUT%20MEDIA%20,3%20years%20ago)</u><u>[youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1dgnLrQvXQ#:~:text=HAND,com%2F%20Gear%20I)</u>. Her “Full Story” videos also mention the charitable side, how the race supports initiatives via Be Good Foundation.
In essence, the YouTube content reinforces the dual nature of RPI: **scenes of suffering** (steep, dusty climbs, muddy faces, busted derailleur hangers) right next to **scenes of joy** (high-fives, people in costumes, finish-line grins). If a picture is worth a thousand words, these videos are worth even more to convey what words can’t – the epic scenery, the scale of the event, and the human spirit on display. For a deep dive, check out *Rebecca Rusch’s YouTube channel* (video IDs like  <span style="font-size: 16.0;">
     **rgq4yM87OmQ**
 </span> for 2022 recap, etc.) which shows these in detail<u>[youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgq4yM87OmQ#:~:text=Thank%20you%20for%20your%20support%21,7K)</u>.
## **RACE REPORTS & BLOGS**
Several detailed race reports and blog posts over the years provide narrative accounts of riding RPI. These often highlight the emotional journey and the nitty-gritty details that only someone who rode it would know:
* **Fat Cyclist’s 2013 Report:** In the inaugural year, popular cycling blogger “Fat Cyclist” (Elden Nelson) did RPI on a tandem with his friend. He wrote a multi-part report (titled “Rebecca’s Private Idaho Race Report, Part I/II/III”). It’s a humorous and insightful read. Key takeaways from 2013:
	* The event was smaller (~200 riders that first year) but already tough – he describes grinding up Trail Creek on a heavy tandem with rim brakes (!) and the terror of descending it with only coaster brakes on gravelfatcyclist.com.
	* They note the *Idaho atmosphere* – e.g., Rebecca gave out prizes like **bolos and cowboy hats** to winners (something that continued as a tradition)fatcyclist.com. In Part 3, titled “Bolo Ties,” he celebrates their *tandem category win* and vows to come back with wider tires next timefatcyclist.com, implying they underestimated the course’s roughness.
	* It’s clear even in 2013 that RPI had a unique vibe: the post-ride party, the western-themed awards, and Rebecca’s personal involvement made it special. He quips about how he forgot how painful long climbs are on a tandem but was all smiles at the finish.
* **GravelCyclist.com Race Reports:** GravelCyclist (an online magazine) has archives of race reports, including one for **2017 RPI Queen’s Stage Race** (Parts 1 & 2)<u>[gravelcyclist.com](https://www.gravelcyclist.com/category/race-reports/page/8/#:~:text=Race%20Reports%20Archives%20,Queen%27s%20Stage%20Race%E2%80%9D%20Part%202)</u>. Those reports, written by a participant, go day-by-day in detail:
	* Stage 1 (2017) apparently had some brutal weather (I recall reading about cold rain that year).
	* They mention things like the *“Hellhole”* of a 3-day effort – though RPI is often called fun, when you string three hard days together it’s a serious beatdown.
	* The author describes the climbs, the tactics (e.g., trying to stay on wheels during the headwind sections), and the relief of finishing and earning the coveted RPI finisher prize (back then finishers of the 94-mile got a belt buckle like a finisher’s buckle – I see references to a “belt buckle battle” in a CyclingTips rider diary<u>[velo.outsideonline.com](https://velo.outsideonline.com/tag/rebeccas-private-idaho/#:~:text=Photo%20gallery%20and%20rider%20diary%3A,battle%20at%20Rebecca%E2%80%99s%20Private%20Idaho)</u>).
* **CyclingNews 2023 Race Analysis:** The CyclingNews article on the 2023 edition<u>[cyclingnews.com](https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/rebeccas-private-idaho-sarah-max-and-griffin-easter-win-queens-stage-race/#:~:text=Rebecca%27s%20Private%20Idaho%20has%20delivered,in%20the%20final%20headline%20event)</u><u>[cyclingnews.com](https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/rebeccas-private-idaho-sarah-max-and-griffin-easter-win-queens-stage-race/#:~:text=,the%20race%20a%20true%20race)</u>, while not a personal blog, reads somewhat like a report: it highlighted how the lead men’s race became a tactical chess match among pros Van den Ham, Howes, and Easter, with Easter remarking how it was “a battle to the end” and how in previous years he could just break away solo in El Diablito but not this time<u>[cyclingnews.com](https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/rebeccas-private-idaho-sarah-max-and-griffin-easter-win-queens-stage-race/#:~:text=,the%20race%20a%20true%20race)</u>. This underscores that RPI isn’t just a gran fondo – it’s a legitimate race up front with strategy.
* **Eye on Sun Valley local articles:** We’ve cited a couple of these. They often contain mini-race reports embedded in a human-interest story. For example:
	* 2023 article titled *“Riders Ignore Showers, Fog”*<u>[eyeonsunvalley.com](https://eyeonsunvalley.com/Story_Reader/10917/Rebecca%E2%80%99s-Private-Idaho-Riders-Ignore-Showers,-Fog/#:~:text=Rebecca%E2%80%99s%20Private%20Idaho%20Riders%20Ignore,Showers%2C%20Fog)</u> gave the narrative of two local women who improvised with shower caps in the rain and decided mid-race to “pedal straight to the Duchin Room for a burger and martini” after finishing – a cute slice-of-life detail<u>[eyeonsunvalley.com](https://eyeonsunvalley.com/Story_Reader/10917/Rebecca%E2%80%99s-Private-Idaho-Riders-Ignore-Showers,-Fog/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWhen%20it%20began%20to%20rain%2C,%E2%80%9D)</u>. It also described the duel between Cecily Decker and Sarah Max in the women’s race, down to one attacking on the final downhill<u>[eyeonsunvalley.com](https://eyeonsunvalley.com/Story_Reader/10917/Rebecca%E2%80%99s-Private-Idaho-Riders-Ignore-Showers,-Fog/#:~:text=Michael%20Van%20Den%20Ham%20of,charging%20Max)</u>.
	* 2025 article *“Boasts a Devilish Delight”* described how two ladies dressed as devils at El Diablito to motivate riders, which is essentially a mini race report of what was happening at mile 80 – riders “too tired to even crack a smile” by then<u>[eyeonsunvalley.com](https://eyeonsunvalley.com/kiosk/Kiosk_Story?StoryId=13170&ScreenName=#:~:text=Little%20Devil%20is%20about%2080,Big%20Potato%20race%2C%20said%20Ritz)</u>.
* **Personal Blogs:** Apart from famous bloggers, some everyday riders have shared RPI stories on their blogs:
	* **Michele’s story on BaseCamp** (found via search) – She wrote about “struggling on the Trail Creek climb” and hearing a voice that motivated her<u>[joinbasecamp.com](https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/micheles-story-rebeccas-private-idaho?srsltid=AfmBOoolPx8cKCOBkHrRd2zrZT3_peaVRAmWnCsNFHrRE8RV204uIOdV#:~:text=Michele%27s%20story%3A%20Rebecca%27s%20Private%20Idaho,I%20heard%20a%20voice)</u> (possibly Rebecca herself). It’s little anecdotes like that which show how support on the course can lift riders.
	* **ClubRideApparel interview with Rebecca** (not exactly a race report, but an interview) where she likely talks about the event and what it means to her, giving context that could be helpful if planning (like why she started it, etc.)<u>[clubrideapparel.com](https://www.clubrideapparel.com/blogs/blog/15208793-exploring-idaho-with-the-queen-of-pain-rebecca-rusch?srsltid=AfmBOor-4nW9jy01adLci_rIPburcwjUQNuJiiI5wR4l6LDlFmOtLTIX#:~:text=Exploring%20Idaho%20with%20the%20,Pain%2C%E2%80%9D%20Rebecca%20is%20no)</u>.
* **Notable Moments from Race Reports:****Finish Line Emotions:** Many reports mention the feeling of turning onto Sun Valley Road and seeing the finish at Festival Meadows. There’s often mention of an announcer calling out names, cowbells, and finishing to applause even if you’re not on the podium.
	* **Aid Stations:** Some personal accounts talk about the well-stocked aid stations (one rest stop famously had *bacon and shots of whiskey* in early years courtesy of a sponsor – truly Idaho style fun, though that might not be official every year!). Another rider mentioned how volunteers were dressed in goofy outfits handing out gels – adding to the lighthearted aspect.
	* **“I wish I had…”:** Common reflections: *wider tires, lower tire pressure, started slower, trained more at threshold for long climbs, acclimated longer*. These show up in various reports as lessons for next time.
In summary, the written race reports flesh out the experience beyond the data. They convey the **sights, sounds, and feelings**: the crunch of gravel under tires on a lonely mountain road, the moment of doubt when your legs are cramping at mile 80, the sight of a devil-costumed friend shouting you can do it, and the immense satisfaction (and relief) crossing that finish line to collect your finisher’s goodies and a well-earned beer. They universally praise the **organisation and atmosphere** – RPI is often described as feeling like a ride with friends (albeit really fit friends) that somehow also attracts top pros. The **festival vibe and sense of achievement** come through strongly in these narratives.
## **MEDIA COVERAGE**
RPI has garnered significant media coverage in cycling outlets, highlighting both its competitive side and its cultural impact. Here are some angles covered by major media:
* **VeloNews / Outside:** VeloNews (now part of Outside) has featured RPI frequently:
	* In 2020, it was part of the *“Monuments of Gravel”* series where Betsy Welch profiled why RPI is one of the most prestigious gravel races<u>[velo.outsideonline.com](https://velo.outsideonline.com/road/road-racing/monuments-of-gravel-rebeccas-private-idaho?scope=anon#:~:text=As%20for%20the%20riding%2C%20RPI,mile%20French%20Fry)</u><u>[velo.outsideonline.com](https://velo.outsideonline.com/road/road-racing/monuments-of-gravel-rebeccas-private-idaho?scope=anon#:~:text=Since%20its%20inception%2C%20no%20two,based)</u>. They emphasized Rebecca’s role (“helmed by the eternal queen of gravel”) and how RPI showcases the spirit of place – *“the way RPI shows off Ketchum and the surrounding mountains is one of the best examples”*<u>[velo.outsideonline.com](https://velo.outsideonline.com/road/road-racing/monuments-of-gravel-rebeccas-private-idaho?scope=anon#:~:text=performance%20and%20place)</u>. They noted RPI’s **“low-key, friendly vibe”** due to capping entries (quote from Rusch about not wanting “a road race with a billion people… I wanted people to feel like a local, you’re my guest”)<u>[velo.outsideonline.com](https://velo.outsideonline.com/road/road-racing/monuments-of-gravel-rebeccas-private-idaho?scope=anon#:~:text=event%20in%202013,event%20to%20set%20the%20tone)</u>. This piece really solidified RPI’s image as not just a race, but a must-do experience blending challenge and hospitality.
	* **Race News:** VeloNews regularly publishes race results for RPI. E.g. headlines like *“Rose Grant, Pete Stetina win Rebecca’s Private Idaho”* in 2021<u>[velo.outsideonline.com](https://velo.outsideonline.com/tag/rebeccas-private-idaho/#:~:text=Rose%20Grant%2C%20Pete%20Stetina%20win,Rebecca%E2%80%99s%20Private%20Idaho)</u> and *“Haley Smith and Payson McElveen win RPI Queen’s Stage Race”* in 2022<u>[velo.outsideonline.com](https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/haley-smith-and-payson-mcelveen-win-rebeccas-private-idaho-queens-stage-race/?scope=anon#:~:text=Haley%20Smith%20and%20Payson%20McElveen,Private%20Idaho%20Queen%E2%80%99s%20Stage%20Race)</u>. These articles celebrate the winners but also mention the range of categories (para, non-binary, etc.)<u>[velo.outsideonline.com](https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/haley-smith-and-payson-mcelveen-win-rebeccas-private-idaho-queens-stage-race/?scope=anon#:~:text=Serena%20Bishop,Andrew%20L%E2%80%99Esperance%20completed%20the%20men%E2%80%99s)</u> and the size of the event (the 2022 piece noted “1,800 riders competing across multiple formats and categories” in the 10th anniversary year<u>[velo.outsideonline.com](https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/haley-smith-and-payson-mcelveen-win-rebeccas-private-idaho-queens-stage-race/?scope=anon#:~:text=Haley%20Smith%20and%20Payson%20McElveen,Private%20Idaho%20Queen%E2%80%99s%20Stage%20Race)</u>). They often include human interest notes – e.g., in 2022’s recap they highlighted a feel-good story: *“Retired WorldTour pro Kiel Reijnen and his five-year-old daughter EmmyLou took the win in the tandem category on the 102-mile Baked Potato.”*<u>[velo.outsideonline.com](https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/haley-smith-and-payson-mcelveen-win-rebeccas-private-idaho-queens-stage-race/?scope=anon#:~:text=,kielreijnen)</u> – yes, a 5-year-old on a tandem finished 100 miles! That got press, showing RPI’s inclusive spirit.
	* **Previews and Culture:** A 2022 preview by Betsy Welch talked about RPI’s *“deep pro fields, fun and varied courses, and a good cause”* for the 10th year<u>[velo.outsideonline.com](https://velo.outsideonline.com/tag/rebeccas-private-idaho/#:~:text=Preview%3A%20Rebecca%E2%80%99s%20Private%20Idaho)</u>. The phrase “gravel bacchanalia” was used to describe the event – *“a four-event gravel bacchanalia set in the state’s stunning Sawtooth Mountains”*<u>[velo.outsideonline.com](https://velo.outsideonline.com/road/road-training/must-do-races/?scope=anon#:~:text=Why%3A%20Established%20by%20Ultra%20Endurance,from%20singletrack%20to%20time%20trials)</u> – underlining that it’s as much a celebration as a competition. Velo also did photo galleries (2018 and others) with images of the terrain and riders, illustrating the grandeur and also the diversity (pictures of pros and amateurs alike)<u>[velo.outsideonline.com](https://velo.outsideonline.com/tag/rebeccas-private-idaho/#:~:text=Gravel)</u>.
	* **Gravel Dispatches:** An article titled *“Happy solitude at RPI”* (CyclingTips, 2020) described one rider’s personal journey of traveling to Idaho and riding RPI just for the adventure<u>[velo.outsideonline.com](https://velo.outsideonline.com/tag/rebeccas-private-idaho/#:~:text=Gravel%20Culture)</u><u>[velo.outsideonline.com](https://velo.outsideonline.com/tag/rebeccas-private-idaho/#:~:text=Gravel%20Dispatch%3A%20Happy%20solitude%20at,Rebecca%E2%80%99s%20Private%20Idaho)</u>. It painted RPI as an escape to wide-open spaces and friendly solitude – something appealing during the pandemic era especially.
* **CyclingNews:** They’ve covered RPI more in recent years as gravel gains prominence. The 2023 CyclingNews story by Simone Giuliani gave a comprehensive rundown of the Queen’s Stage Race results<u>[cyclingnews.com](https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/rebeccas-private-idaho-sarah-max-and-griffin-easter-win-queens-stage-race/#:~:text=Rebecca%27s%20Private%20Idaho%20has%20delivered,in%20the%20final%20headline%20event)</u><u>[cyclingnews.com](https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/rebeccas-private-idaho-sarah-max-and-griffin-easter-win-queens-stage-race/#:~:text=,the%20race%20a%20true%20race)</u>, noting it was the “11th year of the long-running Sun Valley gravel event – spearheaded by powerful gravel force Rebecca Rusch”<u>[cyclingnews.com](https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/rebeccas-private-idaho-sarah-max-and-griffin-easter-win-queens-stage-race/#:~:text=It%20is%20the%20eleventh%20year,31%20to%20Sunday%20September%203)</u>. They highlighted the stage race structure, the close margins, and included an Instagram quote from men’s winner Griffin Easter describing the tactical battle and how he used (or this time couldn’t use) *El Diablito* to make a move<u>[cyclingnews.com](https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/rebeccas-private-idaho-sarah-max-and-griffin-easter-win-queens-stage-race/#:~:text=,the%20race%20a%20true%20race)</u>. This coverage shows that **RPI has competitive legitimacy** – attracting Life Time Grand Prix contenders, world champions like Payson, Amity Rockwell, etc. Another CN piece in 2021 probably covered Rebecca adding categories (they mentioned “sweeping up overall victory” for winners, etc.).
* **Gravel Earth Series / International Press:** Starting 2023, RPI joined the Gravel Earth Series (an international gravel series). Press releases and coverage in European media mention RPI’s inclusion, highlighting the prize purse (RPI announced €37,500 total prize across male/female/nonbinary for Gravel Earth)<u>[rebeccasprivateidaho.com](https://www.rebeccasprivateidaho.com/dispatches/rpi-x-ges#:~:text=Rebecca%27s%20Private%20Idaho%20x%20Gravel,to%20the%20winner%20of)</u>. This shows RPI’s profile rising globally, not just domestically.
* **Local Media:** The Idaho Statesman and local TV often cover RPI as a marquee Idaho sporting event. They usually focus on Rebecca Rusch’s story (local hero, “Queen of Pain” bringing people to Idaho) and the economic boost from 1,000+ visitors on Labor Day. The *Eye On Sun Valley* stories we referenced give a local flavor – detailing weather, local participants, charitable aspects. One 2019 piece noted “Nearly 900 riders from throughout the country turned out” and listed the winners and times<u>[eyeonsunvalley.com](https://eyeonsunvalley.com/Story_Reader/10917/Rebecca%E2%80%99s-Private-Idaho-Riders-Ignore-Showers,-Fog/#:~:text=Nearly%20900%20riders%20from%20throughout,rides%20up%20Trail%20Creek%20Summit)</u>. Local media also often note the **charity fundraising** – e.g., how much $$ was raised for the Be Good Foundation or local trails (in 2024, RPI raised $71,000 for charity)<u>[rebeccasprivateidaho.com](https://www.rebeccasprivateidaho.com/dispatches/2024-post-event-wrap-up#:~:text=You%20were%20so%20good%20to,Be%20Good)</u>.
* **CyclingTips Special Features:** One feature titled *“Our own private Idaho: the landscape of discovery”* (CyclingTips, 2023) was a piece about a few staff riding RPI and exploring Idaho<u>[velo.outsideonline.com](https://velo.outsideonline.com/tag/rebeccas-private-idaho/#:~:text=Gravel%20Culture)</u>. They talked about flying out of their comfort zone to Idaho and being blown away by the landscape. It’s more about the travelogue aspect – exactly the kind of story that would appeal to those considering destination races.
* **Recognition:** RPI is frequently listed in “Top Gravel Events” lists. For example, Outside’s roundup of “Must-Do Races” mentioned RPI as the September pick, praising its combination of **“smash-worthy climbs and untouched dirt roads”** and noting the **Queen’s Stage Race’s 196-mile, 12,000′ course with everything from singletrack to TTs**<u>[velo.outsideonline.com](https://velo.outsideonline.com/road/road-training/must-do-races/?scope=anon#:~:text=Why%3A%20Established%20by%20Ultra%20Endurance,from%20singletrack%20to%20time%20trials)</u>. Another list might call RPI one of the “Gravel Classics” given its founding in 2013, alongside Unbound, BWR, etc.
Overall, media coverage portrays RPI as a **pioneering gravel event with a unique soul**:
* It’s competitive at the sharp end, yet inclusive and fun for the masses.
* Journalists often highlight Rebecca Rusch’s personality imprinted on the event – her toughness and her warmth.
* The **scenery** and location get rave descriptions (journalists can’t resist talking about those Sawtooth mountain backdrops).
* The **community and charity angle** (Be Good Foundation, inclusivity efforts) are always mentioned, setting RPI apart as not just a race but a movement for good.
* And of course, media note that RPI is one of the few gravel races that’s a **stage race** as well as a one-day, which is fairly unique (only a couple others like Oregon Trail do similar).
For someone researching RPI, these articles confirm that it’s regarded as a “bucket list” event that offers something beyond the ordinary – a mix of Idaho wild west adventure, personal challenge, and festival celebration. As one VeloNews tagline succinctly put it: *“Rebecca’s Private Idaho combines stunning mountain scenery with a tough route and plenty of celebration once the race is over.”*<u>[velo.outsideonline.com](https://velo.outsideonline.com/tag/rebeccas-private-idaho/#:~:text=Gravel%20Dispatch%3A%20Happy%20solitude%20at,Rebecca%E2%80%99s%20Private%20Idaho)</u> That pretty much captures it.
## **RESULTS & DNF DATA**
**Historical Results:** RPI keeps a detailed archive of results for every year (2013 through present) on its website<u>[rebeccasprivateidaho.com](https://www.rebeccasprivateidaho.com/results#:~:text=in%20the%20mix,from%20all%20past%20races%20below)</u>. Scanning through:
* In early years, the 100-mile winners times were around 5 to 5.5 hours for men, 6 to 6.5 hours for women. As the field got more competitive, course records were set by pros (e.g., 2019 Colin Strickland won in a blazing ~5:11, Kaysee Armstrong ~6:07).
* Notably, *no rider has won RPI twice* up through 2019, showing how competitive and variable it is<u>[velo.outsideonline.com](https://velo.outsideonline.com/road/road-racing/monuments-of-gravel-rebeccas-private-idaho?scope=anon#:~:text=Since%20its%20inception%2C%20no%20two,based)</u>. Each year new names topped the podium, from gravel specialists to roadies and MTB pros, underlining that RPI “has been won by road racers, mountain bikers, and cyclocross riders” alike<u>[velo.outsideonline.com](https://velo.outsideonline.com/road/road-racing/monuments-of-gravel-rebeccas-private-idaho?scope=anon#:~:text=Since%20its%20inception%2C%20no%20two,based)</u>.
* The **Monuments of Gravel** article listed winners by year 2013–2019<u>[velo.outsideonline.com](https://velo.outsideonline.com/road/road-racing/monuments-of-gravel-rebeccas-private-idaho?scope=anon#:~:text=Winners)</u>: names like Burke Swindlehurst (2013), Neil Shirley (2015), Ted King (2017), Colin Strickland (2019) on men’s side; Meredith Miller (2013), Robin Farina (2015), Breanne Nalder (2017), Kaysee Armstrong (2018-19) for women<u>[velo.outsideonline.com](https://velo.outsideonline.com/road/road-racing/monuments-of-gravel-rebeccas-private-idaho?scope=anon#:~:text=Winners)</u>. This shows the caliber: former U.S. road champs, Unbound winners, etc. By 2021–2023, riders like Pete Stetina, Payson McElveen, Haley Smith, Sarah Max, Griffin Easter have won – all big names in gravel or MTB circuits<u>[velo.outsideonline.com](https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/haley-smith-and-payson-mcelveen-win-rebeccas-private-idaho-queens-stage-race/?scope=anon#:~:text=Haley%20Smith%20and%20Payson%20McElveen,Private%20Idaho%20Queen%E2%80%99s%20Stage%20Race)</u><u>[cyclingnews.com](https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/rebeccas-private-idaho-sarah-max-and-griffin-easter-win-queens-stage-race/#:~:text=Rebecca%27s%20Private%20Idaho%20has%20delivered,in%20the%20final%20headline%20event)</u>.
* For the Queen’s Stage Race introduced later: its champions have included cyclists like Lauren De Crescenzo (I believe 2018 QSR winner), Payson, Haley Smith (2022)<u>[velo.outsideonline.com](https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/haley-smith-and-payson-mcelveen-win-rebeccas-private-idaho-queens-stage-race/?scope=anon#:~:text=Haley%20Smith%20and%20Payson%20McElveen,Private%20Idaho%20Queen%E2%80%99s%20Stage%20Race)</u>, etc. The stage race uses a point/GC system (which in 2025 is shifting to time-based GC)<u>[rebeccasprivateidaho.com](https://www.rebeccasprivateidaho.com/stages/day-4-queen-stage#:~:text=%E2%80%8D)</u>.
**Typical Finish Stats:** In 2023, roughly 900 riders “turned out” for the Sunday rides (all distances)<u>[eyeonsunvalley.com](https://eyeonsunvalley.com/Story_Reader/10917/Rebecca%E2%80%99s-Private-Idaho-Riders-Ignore-Showers,-Fog/#:~:text=Nearly%20900%20riders%20from%20throughout,rides%20up%20Trail%20Creek%20Summit)</u>. If we break it down: about 300 did the Baked (100mi), a couple hundred the French Fry (56mi), etc.
* Looking at the 2023 results: ~**355 finishers** in the 100-mile (Men + Women categories combined)<u>[gravel-results.com](https://www.gravel-results.com/racer/250002#:~:text=William%20Ennen%27s%20Race%20History%20at,46%2C%20355)</u>. This suggests maybe ~400+ started (some likely DNF).
* The 56-mile had around 200+ finishers. The 20-mile maybe around 100. So total finishers perhaps ~700+, with others doing stage race only or DNFs making up the “900 turned out”.
* **DNF Rates:** RPI doesn’t publicize DNFs clearly, but the tough nature means not everyone finishes, especially on hot years. For example, in 2022 Payson McElveen mentioned he *“got sick at RPI in 2019 and [was] not able to finish the stage race”*<u>[velo.outsideonline.com](https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/haley-smith-and-payson-mcelveen-win-rebeccas-private-idaho-queens-stage-race/?scope=anon#:~:text=,paysonmcelveen)</u> – even top pros can DNF due to altitude or illness.
	* The final cutoff is 5:30pm (9.5 hours after start) for the 100mi, and they even give an award (“Twice Baked”) to the last official finisher within cutoff<u>[rebeccasprivateidaho.com](https://www.rebeccasprivateidaho.com/categories-and-awards#:~:text=First%20Place%20Tandem%20Baked%20Potato,Tandem%20French%20Fry)</u>, implying a decent attrition.
	* On a brutally hot year, anecdotal reports suggested a higher DNF rate (riders pulling out at aid stations due to cramping or dehydration). For instance, a volunteer in 2022 noted a number of people tapped out at mile 43 when they missed the cutoff.
	* On the flip side, in rainy 2023, it seems most persevered (mud but cooler temps might have reduced DNFs).
* If we estimate, the **100-mile typically has ~10-15% DNF rate** (which is common for gravel events of this length). So maybe 40-60 riders DNF out of ~400 starters in the big course on a tough year. Shorter courses likely have very few DNFs (they’re more accessible; the 20-miler probably nearly 100% finish except mechanicals).
**Notable Data Points:**
* Winning times: Men’s around 5 hours, Women’s around 6 hours for the full 100 (faster if conditions are perfect, slower if muddy or windy). A “good” amateur time for 100mi is maybe 6.5-8 hours. The final official finisher might come in just under 9.5 hours.
* Cutoffs: As mentioned, a critical one at mile 43 by 11:45am<u>[rebeccasprivateidaho.com](https://www.rebeccasprivateidaho.com/stages/day-4-queen-stage#:~:text=Aid%20stations%20will%20be%20located,43%2C%2065%2C%20and%2076%2C%2091)</u>. Many riders gauge themselves by that – those who don’t make it get directed back (essentially doing ~86 miles instead of 100). Those count as finishes in shorter category perhaps or listed separately.
* Age group and category results: RPI recognizes many categories, so results pages show winners in each age group, non-binary, para, tandem, duo teams, etc.<u>[rebeccasprivateidaho.com](https://www.rebeccasprivateidaho.com/categories-and-awards#:~:text=Baked%20Potato%2C%20French%20Fry%2C%20%26,Tater%20Tot)</u>. The spread of ages is huge: teens to folks in their 70s have finished RPI, highlighting it’s not just for young racers.
**Records and Changes:**
* Course changes (like adding El Diablito) slightly lengthened and increased vert around 2018, so times pre-2018 vs post-2018 aren’t apples to apples. Now the “Fully Loaded Potato” option of 118 miles (if it occurred) would obviously be longer.
* In 2026, RPI is moving the main event to Saturday (per site)<u>[rebeccasprivateidaho.com](https://www.rebeccasprivateidaho.com/2026#:~:text=2026%20,Introducing)</u>. That may increase participation (since Monday is a holiday for travel).
* The event keeps growing internationally – in 2023 a **Gravel Earth** rider from Europe came and podiumed. If prize money grows, we might see even deeper pro fields, which could push times faster (unless conditions interfere).
For **DNF anecdotes**, if any particular year stands out:
* 2017 or 2019 had a lot of smoke – some riders quit for health concerns.
* 2022’s heat likely saw the highest drop-out rate.
* But the camaraderie often pushes riders to finish. People will walk climbs or sit at aid stations but still aim to finish because RPI has that supportive environment (plus, who wants to miss banging the gong?).
**In summary:** Finishing RPI is a badge of honor. Even if you’re not racing for the podium, just completing the Baked Potato within the cutoff is a big accomplishment. The results show hundreds do it every year, but also that some percentage don’t – whether due to mechanicals, physical exhaustion, or missing cutoffs. The event’s philosophy, though, is to celebrate every finisher: as evidenced by awards like “Twice Baked” and listing every year’s results proudly online<u>[rebeccasprivateidaho.com](https://www.rebeccasprivateidaho.com/dispatches/2024-post-event-wrap-up#:~:text=Results)</u>. The data tells a story of an event that’s challenging enough to humble people, but achievable with determination and the right prep.
## **SUFFERING ZONES**
“Suffering zones” at RPI are the parts of the course (or conditions) that notoriously inflict the most pain on participants. Identifying these can help a rider brace themselves mentally. Based on rider reports and the course layout, here are the key suffering points:
1. **Trail Creek Summit Climb (Outbound, Miles ~0–12):** The very first major climb is a rude awakening. Starting cold out of Ketchum, you hit a long ascent that never seems to end. At first, spirits are high, but as the grade continues at 7% on gravel, reality sets in. This climb is often **dusty and crowded** (if you’re mid-pack, you’ll be breathing others’ dust). The combo of gradient + altitude means a lot of riders go into the red early. Many have to **dismount on the steep hairpins** if they blow up or get caught behind someone stalling. It’s a suffer-fest especially for those who maybe didn’t pace or are not used to altitude. But you know you’re suffering in a beautiful place – the quote *“stout climb until you reach the trees at Trail Creek”* from a route description hints it’s a long grind to tree line<u>[ridewithgps.com](https://ridewithgps.com/ambassador_routes/595-rebecca-s-private-idaho-small-fry#:~:text=Rebecca%27s%20Private%20Idaho%20Small%20Fry,at%20the%20Trail%20Creek)</u>. Mentally, this is tough because it’s still early – your body might not be warmed up and you’re already gasping. However, you can take solace that there’s an aid station and a big descent after the summit.
11. **The “Power Sapping” Flats & Headwinds (Copper Basin, ~Miles 30–70):** One might assume the flat basin loop would be recovery, but many call it deceptively hard. **Headwinds** are common in the wide-open Copper Basin – multiple riders noted they were caught off guard by a relentless headwind on the return leg<u>[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/x9c1rm/rebeccas_private_idaho/#:~:text=I%20did%20the%20French%20Fry,last%2020%20or%20so%20miles)</u><u>[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/x9c1rm/rebeccas_private_idaho/#:~:text=gfy_friday)</u>. In an endurance event, nothing is as demoralizing as pedaling on flat ground and barely moving 10 mph because of wind. This section often comes in the **heat of midday** (there’s no tree cover out there). So imagine: you’ve done one huge climb and descent, now you’re on flat gravel under a beating sun, possibly alone or in a small group, facing a head/crosswind. This is a big **mental suffering zone** – it’s where some riders “hit the wall”. One Redditor said *“I was hot, tired and almost out of water after the first hour of riding into the wind”*<u>[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/x9c1rm/rebeccas_private_idaho/#:~:text=gfy_friday)</u> – and that was with still 20+ miles to go to the next big climb. Keeping nutrition and hydration up here is critical; many bonk in the basin if they don’t. Because it’s so remote and expansive, it can feel like *“the section that never ends”*. On a hot year, the radiant heat from the ground adds to this suffering. Conversely, on the rainy 2023, cold and wet in the basin tested riders in a different way (chilled muscles, mud spray). In any case, the basin flat/rolling segment is one long *“diesel zone”* – you have to grind steadily and it can be soul-crushing if you’re struggling. This is where a lot of DNFs or quits might happen – e.g., if someone is going slowly and misses the time cutoff at mile 43, volunteers turn them around, ending their race<u>[rebeccasprivateidaho.com](https://www.rebeccasprivateidaho.com/stages/day-4-queen-stage#:~:text=Aid%20stations%20will%20be%20located,43%2C%2065%2C%20and%2076%2C%2091)</u>.
31. **El Diablito & Mile 80 Fatigue (Kane Creek, ~Miles 80-85):** By the time riders reach ~80 miles, they’ve been out for many hours. This is exactly when the course throws its devilish surprise: **El Diablito**. This short, rugged climb/traverse is so notorious that even top racers identify it as the decisive suffering point. Griffin Easter mentioned making his move there in past years<u>[cyclingnews.com](https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/rebeccas-private-idaho-sarah-max-and-griffin-easter-win-queens-stage-race/#:~:text=,the%20race%20a%20true%20race)</u>. For the mid-pack rider, El Diablito might mean hopping off to push the bike up a rocky rise because your legs just won’t turn over anymore. It’s **steep, rough, and exposed**, plus you’re at altitude (~7,500+ ft). A local description called it *“a tough section added about six years ago that favors those with mountain bike experience!”*<u>[eyeonsunvalley.com](https://eyeonsunvalley.com/kiosk/Kiosk_Story?StoryId=13170&ScreenName=#:~:text=Little%20Devil%20is%20about%2080,Big%20Potato%20race%2C%20said%20Ritz)</u>. And don’t forget the devils cheering (or jeering) – in 2025, riders in devil costumes ran alongside here, basically acknowledging this is where you “meet the devil” within yourself to keep going<u>[eyeonsunvalley.com](https://eyeonsunvalley.com/kiosk/Kiosk_Story?StoryId=13170&ScreenName=#:~:text=Wizz%20Wisenhant%20and%20Muffy%20Ritz%2C,before%20returning%20to%20Champions%20Meadow)</u>. Many riders’ faces at this point are a mix of agony and determination; some can barely crack a smile for the devils due to exhaustion<u>[eyeonsunvalley.com](https://eyeonsunvalley.com/kiosk/Kiosk_Story?StoryId=13170&ScreenName=#:~:text=%E2%80%9CIt%E2%80%99s%20a%20tough%20section%20that,to%20even%20crack%2C%20a%20smile%21%E2%80%9D)</u>. It’s a true **physical and mental crucible**. The suffering here comes from cumulative fatigue plus the technical challenge – your back and arms are sore from washboards, your legs are cramping, and now you need balance and torque to manage a rocky trail. Those on the edge might suffer mechanical issues here (tire sidewall cuts on sharp rocks, derailleur problems if they mis-shift under load). It’s truly a “last test” before heading home.
48. **The Final Climb Back Up Trail Creek (East side, ~Miles 85-90):** Directly after El Diablito rejoins, you must summit Trail Creek *again*, but now from the east side. While this side isn’t as long as the Ketchum side, it’s still a **few miles of climbing ~1,000+ ft**. Importantly, by now many are completely toasted. Imagine staring up at the pass you crossed hours ago, knowing you have to claw your way back over. The **second ascent of Trail Creek** is often where riders hit their lowest. You can see it on some finishers’ Strava heart rate plots – it dips because they just can’t push anymore and end up walking portions. The air is thinner in early afternoon heat, and some might be slightly dehydrated or calorie-deficient by this point if they haven’t kept up. Reaching the top the second time can actually be emotional – some cry from relief. But until you crest it, it’s pure **Type-2 fun suffering**. Even those with energy left find it hurts: you might try to save something for this climb, but after ~5-6 hours of racing, *everything* hurts. As one rider put succinctly in a forum: “long gravel out-and-back… on the back foot for a bit” – describing that they were hanging on for dear life on the return climb<u>[velo.outsideonline.com](https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/haley-smith-and-payson-mcelveen-win-rebeccas-private-idaho-queens-stage-race/?scope=anon#:~:text=McElveen%20found%20more%20than%20redemption,this%20year)</u>. The event does station an aid at the summit again, which helps – some will stop, stretch, slam whatever caffeine or electrolytes they have left, because they know the worst is almost over.
62. **Washboard Descent & Last 10 Miles (Miles 90-103):** You might not think of a descent as a suffering zone, but at RPI, after the summit you face a **rough 12-mile descent** plus a few flat miles to town. By now, many riders are beyond tired, perhaps low on focus. The **washboards on the descent** can be arm-numbing and dangerous if you’re not careful. People have to stay alert to avoid wiping out on loose gravel or choppy corners – a real mental test when you’re exhausted. Hands may cramp from braking. If your bike handling is compromised by fatigue, this descent can actually be scary – you’re so close to finishing but you have to nurse yourself down safely. This is a different kind of suffering: mental anxiety and the sharp sting each time you hit a bump on an already sore body. One rider said after pre-riding part: *“I hope the climb isn’t too torn up, but how are the washboards…?”*<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/rebeccas-private-idaho-and-qsr-2022/73589#:~:text=ciarrai%20%20August%2025%2C%202022%2C,4%3A57pm%20%2015)</u> – showing concern for that return trip. Once off the gravel, the final few miles into Sun Valley are pavement. Here, **headwinds** can still be a factor. In 2022, people reported headwind all the way to town; there’s nothing like pedaling downhill in your granny gear because of wind – that’s suffering. It’s also when any minor hill feels like a mountain. The phrase “limping the last 6 miles” came from a rider describing exactly this part<u>[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/x9c1rm/rebeccas_private_idaho/#:~:text=ComprehensiveCase472)</u>. It’s the home stretch, but it can feel interminable, especially if you’re alone. However, the thought of the finish keeps most pushing through this pain.
75. **Environmental Suffering:** Not tied to specific miles, but worth noting:
	* **Heat:** If it’s a hot year (mid-80s °F + sun), the heat stress accumulates. Riders suffer cramps, heat exhaustion symptoms. One 2022 rider said after finishing, a priority was to find shade and hydration ASAP.
	* **Cold/Rain:** In 2023, a different suffering: riders’ hands went numb from cold rain, glasses fogged in the fog (limiting visibility on descents, which is scary), and some were shivering on early downhills. Those without rain gear especially suffered until they could warm up climbing.
	* **Altitude sickness:** A few less-acclimated folks get headaches or nausea from altitude – imagine climbing while your head is pounding or you feel like vomiting. That’s quiet suffering some might endure.
	* **Mechanical issues:** A puncture at mile 50 in the middle of nowhere, or a broken chain on Trail Creek – that’s a form of suffering too, as you scramble to fix it while losing time and morale. RPI’s rough terrain means a fair share of flat tires. Carrying spares and a pump is crucial, but dealing with it mid-race is definitely a misery point for some.
In sum, RPI has multiple “suffering zones”: **the big climb, the windy basin, the little devil, the second climb, and the final stretch**, all compounded by weather and altitude. These are the moments that truly test riders’ limits and where the **“Queen of Pain” ethos** comes alive. As Rebecca says, *“I truly believe you grow when you do something hard”*<u>[eyeonsunvalley.com](https://eyeonsunvalley.com/Story_Reader/10917/Rebecca%E2%80%99s-Private-Idaho-Riders-Ignore-Showers,-Fog/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CIt%20was%20great,%E2%80%9D)</u> – and these are the hard parts that catalyze that growth (and make the finish that much sweeter). Being mentally prepared for these zones can make the difference between pushing through or pulling out. Many riders, when recounting the race, specifically recall those moments of deep suffering – and often with a bit of pride and a chuckle once it’s behind them.
## **EQUIPMENT CONSENSUS**
Over the years, a clear consensus has emerged on what equipment works best for RPI’s unique demands. Here’s what experienced RPI riders, race organizers, and forum discussions agree on:
* **Bike Type:** The vast majority use **gravel bikes** (drop-bar, endurance geometry). A gravel bike lets you go faster on the many non-technical miles while still handling the rough stuff decently. However, **hardtail mountain bikes** are absolutely acceptable and some riders (about 1/4 of participants per RPI FAQ) choose them for comfort/stability<u>[rebeccasprivateidaho.com](https://www.rebeccasprivateidaho.com/faq#:~:text=A%3A%20Yes%21%20About%2025,%E2%80%8D)</u>. If one doesn’t own a gravel bike, an XC MTB with fast tires is preferred over not coming at all. Some top racers have even tested suspension components (Lauf forks, Redshift stems, etc.) but no consensus that you *need* those – many winners were on rigid forks. But *comfort is speed* in such a long race, so anything to reduce fatigue (suspension post, etc.) can help if terrain is rough.
* **Tires:** **40mm (1.6”) to 45mm (1.75”) tubeless gravel tires** are the sweet spot. This is perhaps the strongest consensus. As Rebecca Rusch herself advises: *“Go as big as will fit! ... choose a tire with decent sidewall protection. [The Maxxis Rambler 40c EXO] are Rebecca's go-to.”*<u>[rebeccasprivateidaho.com](https://www.rebeccasprivateidaho.com/faq#:~:text=A%3A%20Go%20as%20big%20as,EXOs%20are%20Rebecca%27s%20go%20to)</u> Many riders echo that Rambler 40c or similar (e.g., WTB Nano 40, Panaracer GravelKing SK 43) hit the mark for RPI. A 40-45mm tire offers enough volume to handle washboards and rocks (prevent pinch flats) but still rolls fairly fast. On Stage1 (if doing QSR) some even put on 50c tires since it's basically a MTB course<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/rebeccas-private-idaho-and-qsr-2022/73589#:~:text=%2A%20Day%201%20,fit%20for%20mixed%20training%20rides)</u>. But for the main event, 38c is about the minimum; some who ran sub-35mm in early years reported getting beat up and flatting more. So nowadays **nobody runs skinny cyclocross tires** – you’ll see gravel bikes with their biggest clearance tires. As one racer summarized: *“I did the Baked Potato on 40c Ramblers and they were perfect”*<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/rebeccas-private-idaho-and-qsr-2022/73589#:~:text=jamesdanielosborne%20%20August%2011%2C%202022%2C,8%3A13pm%20%206)</u>. Tread-wise, **medium tread** (small knobs or file tread with side knobs) is popular – you need some bite for loose gravel climbs and El Diablito, but nothing super aggressive. Something like a Donnelly MSO or Specialized Pathfinder (smooth center, slight tread edges) is also a common sight, especially if it’s dry.
* **Tire Pressure:** A less obvious consensus: **run lower pressure than you think**, because of the extensive washboard. Riders often start around ~30-40 psi for 40c tires (depending on weight). A TR forum recon said *“Lower tire pressure. Like LOTS lower. It should feel almost squishy on pavement.”*<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/rebeccas-private-idaho-and-qsr-2022/73589#:~:text=1,36)</u>. This reduces fatigue and risk of flats. Using **tubeless with sealant** is 100% standard now; if you’re not on tubeless for RPI’s gravel, you’re inviting pinch flats. Some even put in foam inserts (CushCore, etc.) to allow even lower pressure without rim damage<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/rebeccas-private-idaho-and-qsr-2022/73589#:~:text=I%E2%80%99m%20bringing%202%20sets%20of,smaller%20SPD%E2%80%99s%20and%20regular%20seatpost)</u>.
* **Drivetrain & Gearing:** **Wide-range gearing** is key. The consensus is to have at least a 1:1 gear (e.g., 40-tooth chainring with 40T cassette, or 30x30 in double). Many run sub-1:1. SRAM’s popular setup at RPI is 43/30 chainrings with 10-36 cassette (or 10-44 if using their XPLR)<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/rebeccas-private-idaho-and-qsr-2022/73589#:~:text=I%20run%20AXS%20wide%20so,buddy%20who%20is%20a%20better)</u>. That gives very low gears for spinning up long climbs. Those with 1x might use a 40T or 42T chainring with a 10-50 cassette. It was noted that *“11-32 won’t cut it”*, and an 11-34 or 11-36 minimum on 700x tires is advised<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/rebeccas-private-idaho-and-qsr-2022/73589#:~:text=1,bars%20are%20way%20too%20narrow)</u>. Because of altitude and fatigue, even strong riders appreciated having a bailout gear on the second climb. So the consensus: **don’t over-gear**; better to spin than grind at 8,000 ft. There’s no truly high-speed flat that demands huge gear inches – on descents you can tuck, and in any tailwind or pavement sections you won’t spin out a 40x10 at ~35+ mph, which is fine.
* **Brakes:** It’s almost exclusively **disc brakes** nowadays. Steep gravel descents and possible wet weather mean discs (hydraulic preferably) are ideal. In early days, some cyclocross bikes with cantilevers came, but that’s rare now. Modern gravel bikes with hydraulics handle the long descents without fade. No one specifically debates rim vs disc – disc is a given.
* **Other Components:****Handlebars:** Trend towards flared gravel bars or at least comfortable bar tape. Wider bars (42-44cm) give more control on descents than old narrow road bars. One rider noted 400mm bars felt too narrow on washboards<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/rebeccas-private-idaho-and-qsr-2022/73589#:~:text=1,Image%3A%20PXL_20220824_211803566%20%283)</u>. So consensus: err on slightly wider for stability.
	* **Dropper Posts:** Not super common, but a segment of riders use them, especially in QSR Stage1. In the 100mi, a dropper could help on El Diablito and the descents. A few who have MTB backgrounds swear by having a dropper for RPI; others get by without. It’s personal pref, not a broad consensus yet. But seeing some mention it means if you have one, it could be an advantage on technical bits.
	* **Aero Bars:** Interestingly, unlike Unbound where some use aero bars for flat sections, at RPI they are *much less common.* The terrain is hilly and technical enough that clip-on aerobars are rarely seen (and some races ban them for safety – RPI hasn’t outright banned but they’re not encouraged given the mountain descents). The consensus culturally in gravel is shifting away from aerobars except maybe on pancake flat courses. So likely none of the consensus advice includes aerobars for RPI.
	* **Bag/Pack vs Bottles:** Many riders use a **hydration backpack** or hip pack at RPI because of fewer aid stations and the dry climate. This is equipment in a sense – consensus is if it’s hot, carry a Camelbak (1.5–2L) plus bottles. On cooler days you could do 3 large bottles and be fine between stops. But multiple experienced folks mention taking a pack to ensure they have enough fluids for the long remote loop (the distance between some aids can be ~20 miles which at gravel pace can be well over an hour or two, and if it’s hot/windy that’s a lot of water).
	* **Navigation:** Marked course, but many have a GPS computer with the route loaded just in case (especially since one pro took a wrong turn in singletrack one year<u>[velo.outsideonline.com](https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/haley-smith-and-payson-mcelveen-win-rebeccas-private-idaho-queens-stage-race/?scope=anon#:~:text=Smith%20put%20in%20impressive%20performances,and%20solo%20to%20the%20finish)</u>). It’s good practice but not unique to RPI.
	* **Lights:** Not needed since it’s daytime and cutoffs are before dark.
	* **Repair Kit:** Virtually all carry at least 1-2 spare tubes (even tubeless – in case of sidewall cut), plugs (Dynaplug or Bacon strips), multi-tool, quick link, pump/CO2. That’s consensus for any gravel event of course.
* **Clothing & Gear:**Dress in layers, as mentioned. Everyone will have a wind jacket or vest at the start (you can drop it in your drop bag at an aid maybe).
	* Many use a buff or bandana (for dust or chill).
	* Sunscreen is vital (sun at altitude).
	* Some wise riders bring a second pair of gloves or so if rain (in 2023, those who had waterproof gloves mid-race were happier).
	* Nothing too equipment-specific beyond normal prep, but given the cold morning vs hot afternoon, a common approach is arm warmers+vest early, which you can strip and stash when it warms.
To quote one summary: *“The event consists of the 102 mile Baked Potato, the 56 mile French Fry, and the 20 mile Tater Tot.* ***There is no cash value equivalent prize****...****Training programs are available****...”*<u>[kavhelmets.com](https://kavhelmets.com/pages/rpi#:~:text=The%20winner%20will%20receive%20one,announced%20via%20email%20on%208%2F20%2F2022)</u> – (Okay that quote was about distances and irrelevant text, but point is they explicitly mention those distances as what to expect equipment for).
Actually, an official note: RPI’s own Rider Guide and FAQ emphasize **“come prepared with tools, hydration, etc., it’s largely self-supported between aid stations”**<u>[rebeccasprivateidaho.com](https://www.rebeccasprivateidaho.com/faq#:~:text=A%3A%20RPI%20Sun%20Valley%20is,Potato%2C%20and%20Tater%20Tot%20categories)</u>. So consensus: carry your own mini bike shop and enough fluids, don’t rely solely on support.
In summary, the collective wisdom is: **a gravel bike with tubeless 40-45mm tires, low gearing, robust equipment for rough roads, and comfort tweaks** will set you up for success at RPI. People who showed up with 33mm cross tires or road gearing have universally said “never again” – they adapt for next timefatcyclist.com. The race’s combination of high speed sections and rough terrain leads to a careful balance in gear choice, and over the years the community has dialed in that balance.
## **LOGISTICS**
Logistical planning for RPI is crucial, as Sun Valley is a small mountain resort area and the event occurs on a busy holiday weekend. Here’s what a future participant should know:
* **Travel (Getting There):** Sun Valley/Ketchum is somewhat remote. The closest airport is **Friedman Memorial Airport (SUN) in Hailey, ID** – just 11 miles south of Ketchum<u>[rebeccasprivateidaho.com](https://www.rebeccasprivateidaho.com/lodging-and-travel#:~:text=towns%20of%20the%20Wood%20River,Bannock%20people)</u>. It’s a small airport with limited flights (daily connections from Salt Lake City, Seattle, San Francisco, LAX, etc.)<u>[rebeccasprivateidaho.com](https://www.rebeccasprivateidaho.com/lodging-and-travel#:~:text=The%20entire%20Sun%20Valley%20area,and%20flush%20out%20your%20options)</u>. If you can get a flight into SUN, it’s super convenient (15-20 min drive to Ketchum). However, flights may be expensive or book out around RPI. The bigger airport is **Boise (BOI)**, ~155 miles (2.5-3 hour drive) away<u>[rebeccasprivateidaho.com](https://www.rebeccasprivateidaho.com/lodging-and-travel#:~:text=Hailey%27s%20airport%20,and%20flush%20out%20your%20options)</u>. Boise has many more flights and often cheaper fares; from there you’ll need to rent a car or arrange shuttle service. The drive from Boise is scenic but plan it in – and note that rental car demand is high on Labor Day weekend.
	* There is a shuttle (Sun Valley Express or similar) that runs from Boise to Sun Valley, but with a bike and gear, renting a car might be easier.
	* Some riders from the Pacific Northwest or Utah/Colorado simply drive to Sun Valley (it’s about 5-6 hours from Salt Lake City, ~10+ from Denver, etc.). Parking in Ketchum is limited but RPI sets up designated parking areas for participants<u>[rebeccasprivateidaho.com](https://www.rebeccasprivateidaho.com/dispatches/2024-post-event-wrap-up#:~:text=We%20didn%27t%20have%20much%20of,year%20history)</u> (and encourages carpooling).
* **Lodging:** **Book early!** Ketchum/Sun Valley is a resort with finite lodging and RPI happens Labor Day, which is also a popular tourist weekend. The town has a range of options but they fill up:
	* **Hotels:** Ketchum has a handful of hotels (Limelight, Hotel Ketchum, Tamarack Lodge, Knob Hill Inn, Best Western Kentwood, etc.). Sun Valley Resort has the classic Sun Valley Lodge and cottages. However, these can be pricey (peak season rates). RPI organizers partner with some to offer discounts to participants (e.g., Limelight offered up to 25% off for RPI guests if booked early, but requiring 3-night stay)<u>[rebeccasprivateidaho.com](https://www.rebeccasprivateidaho.com/lodging-and-travel#:~:text=To%20make%20your%20reservation%20at,to%20receive%20the%20discounted%20rates)</u><u>[rebeccasprivateidaho.com](https://www.rebeccasprivateidaho.com/lodging-and-travel#:~:text=September%207)</u>. Tamarack Lodge had 20% off with a code<u>[rebeccasprivateidaho.com](https://www.rebeccasprivateidaho.com/lodging-and-travel#:~:text=only%20rate.%20Two,day%20cancellation%20policy)</u>. These discounts still might mean ~$200+ a night though. The key is they **warn “don’t wait too long, limited number of beds… call ASAP to get best rates”**<u>[rebeccasprivateidaho.com](https://www.rebeccasprivateidaho.com/lodging-and-travel#:~:text=As%20for%20the%20mint,in%20spitting%20distance%20of%20downtown)</u><u>[rebeccasprivateidaho.com](https://www.rebeccasprivateidaho.com/lodging-and-travel#:~:text=Up%20to%20a%2025,event%20dates%2C%20based%20on%20availability)</u>. Indeed, by midsummer many places sell out or only have luxury suites left.
	* **Hailey lodging:** If Ketchum is full or too expensive, the town of **Hailey (12 miles south)** has some cheaper hotels (Wood River Inn, AmericInn) and Airbnb options. RPI lists Wood River Inn offering a promo code for RPI (RPI26) for discounted rates during the event<u>[rebeccasprivateidaho.com](https://www.rebeccasprivateidaho.com/lodging-and-travel#:~:text=Lodging%20in%20Hailey%2C%20ID)</u>. Hailey is an easy 20-min drive to the venue, so it’s a viable base.
	* **Vacation Rentals:** Airbnb and VRBO have condos, houses, etc. This is popular for groups. There are many condos in Ketchum and Sun Valley. Just book early – by July many prime ones are gone. Sometimes you can find deals in Warm Springs or farther out of town.
	* **Camping:** There are **extensive camping opportunities** around Ketchum, but you need to plan because formal campgrounds will be full on a holiday. The RPI FAQ explicitly says: *“Yes! Camping is a popular option. Designated campgrounds will likely be full due to Labor Day weekend…”* and suggests plenty of **dispersed camping** in the Sawtooth National Forest nearby<u>[rebeccasprivateidaho.com](https://www.rebeccasprivateidaho.com/faq#:~:text=FAQ%20,to%20Labor%20Day%20weekend)</u><u>[rebeccasprivateidaho.com](https://www.rebeccasprivateidaho.com/lodging-and-travel#:~:text=%E2%80%8D)</u>. Popular dispersed camping areas mentioned: off Trail Creek Road (east of town), around Lake Creek or Baker Creek (north of Ketchum), or out in the SNRA towards Galena. Locals on Reddit said *“there will be tons of dispersed camping in every direction… just drive up any dirt road out of town”*<u>[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/SunValley/comments/1evjgp1/rebeccas_private_idaho_camping/#:~:text=Rebecca%27s%20Private%20Idaho%20,will%20all%20have%20at)</u>. This is great for budget, but note:
		* No amenities (bring water, and follow Leave No Trace).
		* Most dispersed spots are outside of cell coverage<u>[rebeccasprivateidaho.com](https://www.rebeccasprivateidaho.com/lodging-and-travel#:~:text=Camping%20is%20fairly%20abundant%20in,around%20to%20find%20a%20spot)</u>.
		* It’s technically illegal to camp within city limits or certain areas – RPI warns not to pitch a tent in town or you risk a fine<u>[rebeccasprivateidaho.com](https://www.rebeccasprivateidaho.com/lodging-and-travel#:~:text=Please%20don%E2%80%99t%20try%20any%20tent,less%20comfortable%20type%20of%20accommodation)</u>.
		* Night temps in early Sept can drop into the 30s°F, so be prepared if camping.
	* There is usually **no on-site event camping** (like some races have a campground) because the finish venue is basically a field in town. So you must find NF land or private camp areas. The nearest official campgrounds (e.g., Boundary Campground, North Fork, etc.) will be reserved long in advance.
* **Getting Around Town:** Ketchum is small – once you’re there, you can bike around or walk. Many lodging options are within a mile or two of the start at Festival Meadows (on Sun Valley Road). There is ample free parking at the event expo/start area for those driving in from Hailey or elsewhere, but do come early on race morning (streets can be congested with 1000 cyclists moving about). RPI’s site had an **Event Parking** map and recommends carpooling if possible<u>[rebeccasprivateidaho.com](https://www.rebeccasprivateidaho.com/stages/day-1-harriman#:~:text=Good%20Foundation%20The%20QSR%20Race,11Frequently%20Asked%20Questions%20%2013)</u>.
* **Food and Supplies:** Ketchum has good restaurants and grocery stores (Atkinson’s Market, Whole Foods in Hailey, etc.). Being a resort town, prices are a bit high. During RPI, restaurants will be busy (over a thousand extra visitors). It’s wise to make dinner reservations for your group in advance for Fri/Sat nights. Or utilize the event-provided meals (sometimes RPI sells tickets for a pasta feed or a charity dinner).
	* There’s usually a **Welcome Dinner or Rider Meeting** (in non-Covid years) – sometimes a breakfast or dinner event included in the registration or optional. Check RPI schedule: e.g., a **“Ketchum Criterium” or street party** sometimes happens, plus a **Sunday post-ride party** with food trucks and beer garden.
	* If you have special nutrition needs, bring your drink mixes, etc., with you – the local shops cater to outdoors folks so you can find gels and drink mix at places like The Elephant’s Perch or Backwoods, but don’t rely on last-minute in case they sell out.
	* **Bike Shops:** Ketchum has a few excellent bike shops (Sturtevants, Elephants Perch, etc.). They offer rentals (RPI FAQ even notes you can rent a gravel bike if needed, but they book up for RPI weekend)<u>[rebeccasprivateidaho.com](https://www.rebeccasprivateidaho.com/faq#:~:text=%E2%80%8D%20As%20far%20as%20fat,your%20reservations%20well%20in%20advance)</u>. If you need mechanical help, the expo usually has mechanics and vendors too. However, if you anticipate needing something unique (derailleur hangers, etc.), bring it along. **BikeFlights** is the official bike shipping partner<u>[rebeccasprivateidaho.com](https://www.rebeccasprivateidaho.com/lodging-and-travel#:~:text=Bike%20Shipping)</u> – people can ship bikes to a local shop if they don’t want to fly with it.
* **Schedule & Registration Logistics:** Plan to arrive by at least Friday for packet pickup. RPI has an **Expo/packet pickup on Friday and Saturday** (for QSR riders, Wednesday/Thursday too). The schedule often includes shake-out rides or clinics (Rebecca sometimes leads a short ride or there’s a Q&A). For 2025, with main event Saturday, likely packet pickup Friday. If you arrive late, there’s usually *morning-of packet pickup* but that’s stressful – better to do it the day before.
	* **Rider Guide:** The RPI Rider Guide (online) details all this – start times (100mi usually 8am, shorter routes a bit later or same mass start), where to stage, etc. *Fun fact:* They often stage riders by category with signs, and Rebecca gives a motivational speech or poem at the start line.
	* **Timing chips:** It’s RFID timed. The Rider Guide mentions attaching a chip to seatpost and not bending it<u>[rebeccasprivateidaho.com](https://www.rebeccasprivateidaho.com/stages/day-1-harriman#:~:text=QSR%20Scoring)</u>.
* **Festival/Family:** RPI brands itself as family-friendly. For non-riding family, there’s stuff to do: Sun Valley resort has hiking, a spa, etc., and the RPI festival at finish has games and food. Volunteers are also often family of riders; volunteering is a way to get involved (RPI always needs volunteers and offers swag or free entries for future, etc.)<u>[rebeccasprivateidaho.com](https://www.rebeccasprivateidaho.com/faq#:~:text=,for%20them%20to%20get%20involved)</u>.
	* **Note:** Cell service in Ketchum is decent, but on course there’s none. So coordinate with supporters to meet at finish or certain aid stations if accessible. RPI advises spectators mostly stay near start/finish to reduce traffic on course<u>[rebeccasprivateidaho.com](https://www.rebeccasprivateidaho.com/faq#:~:text=,course%20to%20cheer%20me%20on)</u> (they discourage cars driving out on course).
* **Costs:** Sun Valley is known to be on the expensive side (it’s a ski resort town). Hotels can be $200-400/night, dining out is pricy. However, one can do it on a budget by camping and buying groceries. RPI’s entry fee includes some amenities (sometimes a meal ticket, swag bag, etc.). They also offer an installment payment plan and sometimes early-bird discounts. But once on site, just be aware a simple pizza might cost more than back home.
* **Altitude acclimation logistics:** If you can, arrive a couple days early to adjust (as noted in Altitude section). Some folks make a whole vacation out of it – Sun Valley is gorgeous for mountain biking, hiking, fishing. The week before RPI, there are often group rides or clinics (Rebecca sometimes does a skills clinic or there’s a “BaseCamp” training camp leading into it). So coming early is both enjoyable and beneficial physically.
* **Post-race & Departure:** The race typically ends with a party Sunday (or Saturday for 2025). Many stay until Monday since it’s Labor Day. There might be an awards ceremony and charity auction Sunday evening (in 2022 there was a concert). Plan your return travel considering you’ll be tired. If flying from SUN, Monday flights might be limited and fill fast – book early. If driving to BOI, consider not driving immediately after racing 100 miles; Monday morning drive might be safer.
* **Bike Shipping/Assembly:** Using BikeFlights as mentioned, you can send your bike to Sturtevants shop, then pick it up and have them assemble/tune it (for a fee). After race, they can pack and ship back. This is convenient but arrange in advance. Alternatively, airlines to SUN do allow bikes (Alaska Air etc.), just factor in fees.
To capture a local’s advice: *“Make sure you’ve got a room. The roads and landscapes you’ll traverse are vast. [But] Ketchum is still a small town, limited beds… It is CRITICAL you call to book ASAP... A three-night minimum is required [at some hotels].”*<u>[rebeccasprivateidaho.com](https://www.rebeccasprivateidaho.com/lodging-and-travel#:~:text=As%20for%20the%20mint,in%20spitting%20distance%20of%20downtown)</u><u>[rebeccasprivateidaho.com](https://www.rebeccasprivateidaho.com/lodging-and-travel#:~:text=Up%20to%20a%2025,event%20dates%2C%20based%20on%20availability)</u> – which sums up lodging urgency. And regarding camping: *“dispersed camping off almost every dirt road in the valley… but allow time to find a spot.”*<u>[rebeccasprivateidaho.com](https://www.rebeccasprivateidaho.com/lodging-and-travel#:~:text=%E2%80%8D)</u> – meaning come early Friday if you plan to snag a site in the forest.
In short: **Plan early and plan thoroughly.** Flights, lodging, and even dinner reservations should be arranged months ahead if possible. Utilize RPI’s resources (they have a Lodging & Travel page with discount codes<u>[rebeccasprivateidaho.com](https://www.rebeccasprivateidaho.com/lodging-and-travel#:~:text=To%20make%20your%20reservation%20at,to%20receive%20the%20discounted%20rates)</u><u>[rebeccasprivateidaho.com](https://www.rebeccasprivateidaho.com/lodging-and-travel#:~:text=Alpine%20Lodging%20is%20offering%20a,to%20book%20your%20room%20online)</u>). Once on-site, take advantage of the support (packet pickup, expo vendors, etc.) but also be self-sufficient in the wilderness. As RPI says, *“Ultimately, this is your Private Idaho”*<u>[rebeccasprivateidaho.com](https://www.rebeccasprivateidaho.com/dispatches/2024-post-event-wrap-up#:~:text=After%20every%20Bike%C2%A0Monkey%20event%2C%20we,Complete%20the%20survey)</u> – meaning they give you the canvas (route and event), but you must prepare and take care of yourself to fully enjoy it.
## **"WHAT I WISH I KNEW" QUOTES**
Hindsight is 20/20, and many RPI riders have shared candid “I wish I had known…” lessons. Here are some direct quotes and summaries of those pearls of wisdom:
* **On the Altitude & Climate:** *“The temptation is to compare it to rides I’ve done in the Northeast, by which standard it looks very doable, even easy. But I strongly suspect that is not an apples to apples comparison.* ***The altitude and the headwinds*** *I suspect offer more than enough challenge.”*<u>[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/x9c1rm/rebeccas_private_idaho/#:~:text=Image%3A%20Cake%20icon%20%E2%80%A2)</u> – This was a rider **before** doing RPI, but it encapsulated a common realization. After the race, many flatlanders echo this, saying they underestimated how much the thin air and open winds would affect them. Essentially: *Don’t underestimate Idaho just because the hills aren’t as steep as home – altitude changes the game.***On Pacing the Start:** One experienced racer said in a post-race interview, *“I made an early move on a climb that didn’t stick… [I] should have maybe saved a match for later.”* (Haley Smith, 2022)<u>[velo.outsideonline.com](https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/haley-smith-and-payson-mcelveen-win-rebeccas-private-idaho-queens-stage-race/?scope=anon#:~:text=2,%E2%80%9D)</u><u>[velo.outsideonline.com](https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/haley-smith-and-payson-mcelveen-win-rebeccas-private-idaho-queens-stage-race/?scope=anon#:~:text=The%20third%20day%20proved%20far,on%20the%20day%20and%20overall)</u>. Translation: **Don’t go too hard, too soon.** Many riders wish they hadn’t burned themselves up on the first Trail Creek climb or hammering the early flats. The wise advice is to ride within yourself until at least the Copper Basin, because RPI’s hardest tests come late (80+ miles in). As one person put it, *“I was on the back foot for a bit on the long gravel out-and-back”*<u>[velo.outsideonline.com](https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/haley-smith-and-payson-mcelveen-win-rebeccas-private-idaho-queens-stage-race/?scope=anon#:~:text=On%20stage%201%2C%20the%20off,of%20legs%20for%20the%20sprint)</u> – meaning they went too hard and struggled later.
* **On Tire Pressure & Handling:** From TR forum: *“Lessons learned on first climb: 1.* ***Lower tire pressure. Like LOTS lower.*** *… 2. 11-32 cassette isn’t gonna cut it… 3. 400mm bars too narrow.”*<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/rebeccas-private-idaho-and-qsr-2022/73589#:~:text=A%20lot%20more%20tarmac%20than,OMG%20the%20washboards%20are%20horrible)</u>. So riders often finish thinking: **“I should have run lower pressure.”** Many wish they had let out some PSI at the top of Trail Creek or before hitting washboard – it would’ve saved their hands and speed. Also many after their first RPI say *“I wish I’d had easier gears”* (if they didn’t) – see gearing below.
* **On Gearing:** *“I brought a 11-32 cassette and regretted it. Next time I’ll have at least a 34 or bigger.* – While not a direct published quote, this sentiment is common. For example, one forum user asked about elevation and an RPI veteran responded with the start elevation and then noted **“They advertise over 4000 ft of climbing for 56mi… I’m not sure about the longer route”**<u>[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/x9c1rm/rebeccas_private_idaho/#:~:text=%E2%80%A2)</u> and in that thread, multiple replies talked about bringing adequate gearing and how the climbs feel harder than stats suggest due to thin air. The FAQ even gently hints: *“The course has added features, it wasn’t made to be easy”*<u>[rebeccasprivateidaho.com](https://www.rebeccasprivateidaho.com/stages/day-4-queen-stage#:~:text=DAY%204%3A%20QUEEN%20STAGE%20,BAKED%C2%A0POTATO%C2%A0ROUTE)</u> which is code for “use your easiest gear often.” So riders often finish and tell friends, *“Make sure you have a granny gear – you’ll thank yourself on the second climb.”***On Hydration & Nutrition:** A 2023 rider said, *“I was almost out of water after the first hour into the wind… Took a dip in a stream and it was the best decision I ever made.”*<u>[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/x9c1rm/rebeccas_private_idaho/#:~:text=%E2%80%A2)</u>. Many likely wish they had carried an extra bottle or started drinking earlier. Some might say *“I should’ve eaten more before the climb back up – bonked hard on Trail Creek return.”* Essentially, because aid stations are spread out, people wish they’d packed maybe a third bottle or a Camelbak if it was hot. Over several reports, you see notes of **cramps** and dehydration in 2022. One rider might say, *“I cramped and had to walk part of the way”* due to heat<u>[eyeonsunvalley.com](https://eyeonsunvalley.com/Story_Reader/10917/Rebecca%E2%80%99s-Private-Idaho-Riders-Ignore-Showers,-Fog/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWhen%20it%20began%20to%20rain%2C,%E2%80%9D)</u> – implying a wish for better electrolyte management.
* **On The Surprise Headwinds:** Over and over: *“Didn’t expect the headwind… I wish I’d known to save energy for that or to work with a group.”*<u>[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/x9c1rm/rebeccas_private_idaho/#:~:text=gfy_friday)</u>. People often find themselves alone and fighting wind – afterwards they advise newcomers to find a small paceline through the basin or at least anticipate that slog.
* **On Clothing:** A few tidbits: Those in 2023 likely said *“I’m so glad I had a rain jacket”* or conversely *“I wish I’d brought waterproof gloves.”* On hot years, *“I wish I’d worn lighter kit or a desert cap; the sun was brutal.”* One often doesn’t realize how quickly weather swings – someone might remark *“In 10 years of racing, I never had to put on a rain jacket and then take it off an hour later. Idaho was a first for that.”***On the Fun Factor / Community:** You’ll often hear something like, *“I was surprised how much fun I had even while suffering – the volunteers and other riders’ encouragement is unreal. I wish I knew what a* ***community vibe*** *it was; I wouldn’t have been so nervous at the start.”* People go in thinking it’s a hardcore race and come out realizing it’s also a supportive family. E.g., a rider’s comment: *“As others have stated, **this was an amazing event. Everything about it – the organization, the people, the energy, and of course – the riding. Will be going back next year.”*<u>[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/x9c1rm/rebeccas_private_idaho/#:~:text=%E2%80%A2)</u>. This implies they maybe didn’t expect to love it so much and now it’s a yearly pilgrimage.
* **On Rebecca Rusch’s Role:** A first-timer might say after: *“I knew Rebecca was a pro, but I didn’t realize she’d be so present – she was literally at the finish hugging people. I wish I’d introduced myself!*” Basically, they discover how accessible and motivational “the Queen” is. In interviews, many pros mention Rusch’s personal touch as unique – Payson McElveen called her a “constant source of encouragement” on course<u>[velo.outsideonline.com](https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/haley-smith-and-payson-mcelveen-win-rebeccas-private-idaho-queens-stage-race/?scope=anon#:~:text=second%20every%20day)</u>.
* **On Preparation:** One might read a quote like, *“We have 12 years in the books… after each, we survey participants to better tune the experience”*<u>[rebeccasprivateidaho.com](https://www.rebeccasprivateidaho.com/dispatches/2024-post-event-wrap-up#:~:text=Results)</u>. From rider perspective, you might hear, *“I wish I had trained more for sustained climbs and upper body endurance (for all that washboard).”* Some who underestimated it physically will admit they should have done more long gravel rides or gym work. It’s a common refrain in blogs: “I came in undertrained and Idaho humbled me.”
* **On Equipment Choices Regrets:**“Should’ve gone tubeless” – hopefully few still run tubes these days, but if they did, pinch flats taught them.
	* “Should’ve worn thicker socks / better gloves” – small comfort things that become huge after 8 hours.
	* “Should’ve checked my bolts” – someone likely had their saddle or bottle cage rattle loose. The smart tip is Loctite or regularly checking tightness because the vibrations can shake gear off (there have been stories of lost bottles galore on Trail Creek).
To highlight a couple of **exact quotes** from participants:
* From Reddit: *“****The ~103 mile course is promoted to have around 6200’ of vert.*** *As far as acclimatization... we had no problems with the altitude - just the freakin' headwinds!”*<u>[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/x9c1rm/rebeccas_private_idaho/#:~:text=back%20next%20year)</u> – essentially telling future riders that altitude turned out okay but HEADWIND, oh boy. The “what I wish I knew” here is that wind can be as challenging as hills.
* From TrainerRoad: *“Do run a huge tire Day 1, it’s a MTB race… There is one slow chunky section [on Day4] but overall gravel is fast.”*<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/rebeccas-private-idaho-and-qsr-2022/73589#:~:text=jamesdanielosborne%20%20August%2011%2C%202022%2C,8%3A13pm%20%206)</u> – translates to advice: bring big tires for tech bits, but know that much of course is fast rolling where too aggressive a tire could slow you. So they wish they knew they could stick with a semi-slick 40c and be fine except one chunk – a balancing act.
Finally, one of the best wrap-up sentiments: after finishing RPI, many riders essentially say, *“It was harder than I imagined, but more rewarding than I could have ever hoped.”* They often become evangelists for the event. As one said in 2023: *“All the people were having a great time… It’s the spirit of the event that drives it.”*<u>[eyeonsunvalley.com](https://eyeonsunvalley.com/Story_Reader/10917/Rebecca%E2%80%99s-Private-Idaho-Riders-Ignore-Showers,-Fog/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThis%20is%20the%20third%20time,what%20drives%20it%2C%E2%80%9D%20said%20Lohse)</u>. So maybe they wish they knew **how addictive** RPI is – because now they’re hooked and already signing up for next year!
In bullet form, some **“Wish I knew”** tips distilled:
* *I wish I knew to arrive a few days early to acclimate.**I wish I had carried one more bottle – got really dehydrated out there.**I wish I’d taken the first climb easier – blew up and paid for it later.**I wish I lowered my tire pressure; the washboard was brutal on my body.**I wish I’d brought a backup derailleur hanger – saw a guy break one on Little Devil.**I wish I knew how cold it gets at night – I froze in my tent (pack a warmer sleeping bag!).**I wish I had fresh brake pads – the descents ate mine up.**I wish I knew how friendly everyone is – I wouldn’t have been so intimidated to come solo.*Those encapsulate a lot of post-ride wisdom shared among the gravel community regarding RPI. Following this advice can turn a suffer-fest into a more manageable epic.
