# RED GRANITE GRINDER — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Todd Meerdink [COMPETITIVE]:** "I didn't know we had this many hills. The course designers must have found every single hill in the county." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/2019-ironbull-granite-grinder-race-report-wausau-wisconsin-by-todd-meerdink/)

**Todd Meerdink [COMPETITIVE]:** "Living just an hour away from Wausau for the past 20 years, I had no idea what diverse, challenging terrain lay just outside the city limits. The Ironbull Granite Grinder found those roads, and I will definitely be back to ride them again." Winner of the 80-mile route in 5:27:52. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/2019-ironbull-granite-grinder-race-report-wausau-wisconsin-by-todd-meerdink/)

**Scott Schmoldt [UNKNOWN]:** Finished the 80-mile route in 6:46:40 and commented on the unexpected number of hills in the county. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-ironbull-red-granite-grinder-showcases-central-wisconsin-on-an-epic-racecourse/)

**Race participant (IRONBULL committee member) [UNKNOWN]:** "Racers asked for more distance on gravel, less on busy paved roads and fewer interactions with cars. We also wanted to eliminate hazardous highway crossings." Quote from John Lauer, IRONBULL's executive director. (https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/ironbull-red-granite-grinder-bicycle-090230313.html)

**Jacob [RECREATIONAL]:** Race report from 2022 85-mile route: "I felt the electricity at the dawn start. This was by far the largest group I had ever ridden with and the start did not disappoint." He finished but struggled significantly, noting: "The first 50 miles of the course had worn my body, the next 20 miles were a mental grind." (https://www.ironbull.org/in-the-news/grinder-2022-race-report-jacob)

**Jacob [RECREATIONAL]:** On Rib Mountain climb: "I had to keep reminding myself not to push too hard on this climb, there was still an entire course to finish afterwards. But I was still filled with the excitement of this being my first race and probably pushed harder than I needed too." (https://www.ironbull.org/in-the-news/grinder-2022-race-report-jacob)

**Jacob [RECREATIONAL]:** On technical sections: "What would it be like to ride a gravel bike on a mountain bike single track course? That question was answered in Scotch Creek. The narrow trails had plenty of roots and rocks that proved too much for my skills and gravel bike. I had to walk my bike in more than one spot." (https://www.ironbull.org/in-the-news/grinder-2022-race-report-jacob)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Todd Meerdink [COMPETITIVE]:** Used 40mm tires and was "surprised how well my 40mm tires handled the chunky sections" on the rocky descent from Rib Mountain. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/2019-ironbull-granite-grinder-race-report-wausau-wisconsin-by-todd-meerdink/)

**Todd Meerdink [COMPETITIVE]:** "I brought a Camelback so I wouldn't need to stop at the aid stations" - allowed him to maintain pace with lead group without stopping. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/2019-ironbull-granite-grinder-race-report-wausau-wisconsin-by-todd-meerdink/)

**Jacob [RECREATIONAL]:** "I did go to pick up my bib and packet...I also made a last minute stop to Rib Mountain Cycles to grab a pair of shoe covers in case the forecast of rain came true the next day." Planning for cold/wet conditions proved wise. (https://www.ironbull.org/in-the-news/grinder-2022-race-report-jacob)

**Jacob [RECREATIONAL]:** Experienced mechanical issues: "I felt my chain bind when switching gears on my front chainring...Shortly after departing I tried shifting into my larger front chainring and the chain just fell off...I would spend the rest of the race in my small front chainring, unable to fully take advantage of the downhill descents." (https://www.ironbull.org/in-the-news/grinder-2022-race-report-jacob)

## Weather Experienced

**2019 Race (October 19):** "Partly Cloudy, 53 degrees, wind 7 mph" at start. Rain started mid-day. (https://results.bikereg.com/race/12340 and https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/2019-ironbull-granite-grinder-race-report-wausau-wisconsin-by-todd-meerdink/)

**2022 Race:** Cold conditions with recent snowfall. Jacob noted: "In the excitement, the damp chill in the air didn't seem quite so bad" and "the snow from Friday had coated the tree limbs, creating a very idyllic landscape." Later: "I spent the next 18 miles grinding through the wet gravel, hills and wind...I turned west into the wind for the first time and knew this was going to be a slog." (https://www.ironbull.org/in-the-news/grinder-2022-race-report-jacob)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Rib Mountain Climb:** Todd Meerdink [COMPETITIVE]: "A two-mile, 700ft climb to the peak of the local ski hill...At the peak I was in about 10th, about two minutes behind." The descent featured "A ¾ mile boulder laden trail, officially marked as a hike-a-bike...Traversing the trail with a bike on my shoulder proved challenging." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/2019-ironbull-granite-grinder-race-report-wausau-wisconsin-by-todd-meerdink/)

**Red Granite Surface:** Todd Meerdink [COMPETITIVE]: "The gravel in central Wisconsin is unlike the chunky grey gravel in the rest of the state. Rather, it is mix of red crushed granite, which makes for a much smoother, faster ride. Not to mention, the granite roads were in fantastic shape. With very few potholes, they were some of the best maintained gravel roads I have ridden." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/2019-ironbull-granite-grinder-race-report-wausau-wisconsin-by-todd-meerdink/)

**Nine Mile Forest:** Todd Meerdink [COMPETITIVE]: "Riding wheel to wheel through the cover of 100ft pines...The grass trail eventually gave way to a logging road, which climbed for much longer distance than I preferred." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/2019-ironbull-granite-grinder-race-report-wausau-wisconsin-by-todd-meerdink/)

**Billy Goat Hill:** Todd Meerdink [COMPETITIVE]: "The second largest climb on the course was Billy Goat Hill. A series of two long climbs that flirted with a 15% grade...Reaching 40mph on the descent I used every bit of momentum to start the climb. Unfortunately, the hill stopped my momentum quite rapidly." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/2019-ironbull-granite-grinder-race-report-wausau-wisconsin-by-todd-meerdink/)

**Speedway Double Track [RECREATIONAL perspective]:** Jacob: "Cutting through the woods, the muddy and sloppy track was one of the most difficult portions to navigate...I passed a racer changing a flat and watched as another nearly lost control with their hardtail MTB in the slop. Once I finally rolled back out on the road, my tires were completely caked in mud." (https://www.ironbull.org/in-the-news/grinder-2022-race-report-jacob)

**Scotch Creek Trail System [RECREATIONAL perspective]:** Jacob: "The narrow trails had plenty of roots and rocks that proved too much for my skills and gravel bike. I had to walk my bike in more than one spot. It was still slow going in the rideable parts." (https://www.ironbull.org/in-the-news/grinder-2022-race-report-jacob)

**Course Composition:** 
- 50 mile: "86% gravel roads, 12% paved roads, and 2% well-maintained gravel trail" (https://www.ironbull.org/red-granite-grinder-details)
- 100 mile: "92% gravel roads with only 6% paved roads and a splash (literally at Averill Creek) of adventure doubletrack" including "remote gravel, two track, and a creek crossing" (https://www.ironbull.org/red-granite-grinder-details)
- 150 mile: "Approximately 80% gravel roads, 5% maintained gravel/granite trails, 14% pavement, and an extra dose of grit on doubletrack" (https://www.ironbull.org/red-granite-grinder-details)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Todd Meerdink [COMPETITIVE - 5:27:52 finish, 86 miles]:** "I knew that a maximum effort this early in the race wasn't a wise move, but keeping pace with the slender figures in front of me became more and more difficult" on the Rib Mountain climb. He lost 2 minutes to leaders but made it back on the descent and by catching the lead group. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/2019-ironbull-granite-grinder-race-report-wausau-wisconsin-by-todd-meerdink/)

**Todd Meerdink [COMPETITIVE]:** Successfully stayed with lead group of 5 riders for majority of race: "Staying with this group as long as I could would be crucial to my race...Riding wheel to wheel, we hit the gravel roads in just a few miles." Eventually dropped before 140/86 split, then rode solo final 30 miles. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/2019-ironbull-granite-grinder-race-report-wausau-wisconsin-by-todd-meerdink/)

**Jacob [RECREATIONAL - first gravel race]:** "I wasn't eating since the first aid station and I was feeling the consequences. I hadn't eaten since the first aid station and I was feeling the consequences...After emerging from the trees I stopped and dug out some Oreos I had tossed into my bag on a whim and did my best cookie monster impression. The sugar rush helped lift my spirits." Major nutrition mistake led to energy crash. (https://www.ironbull.org/in-the-news/grinder-2022-race-report-jacob)

**Jacob [RECREATIONAL]:** Training approach: "Working full time with two children didn't leave much time for training...I was riding at least 3 times a week. Typically it was 2 shorter, high intensity rides and 1 longer distance (50+ mile) ride." This proved insufficient for the 85-mile route with significant climbing and technical sections. (https://www.ironbull.org/in-the-news/grinder-2022-race-report-jacob)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Energy management:** Jacob [RECREATIONAL] nearly bonked: "By this point in the race most of the other riders were ahead of me and I would only occasionally catch a glimpse of another rider in the distance. Left to my own thoughts, doubts started entering my mind if I was going to be able to finish." He recovered enough to finish but was significantly depleted. (https://www.ironbull.org/in-the-news/grinder-2022-race-report-jacob)

**Mechanical issues:** Jacob [RECREATIONAL] lost front derailleur functionality mid-race: "I would spend the rest of the race in my small front chainring, unable to fully take advantage of the downhill descents." Still finished but at reduced capacity. (https://www.ironbull.org/in-the-news/grinder-2022-race-report-jacob)

**2019 140-mile race:** Results show multiple DNFs including riders who dropped at various points. Results note "DNF Joel Slezak 5:52:52" and several others with no finish time recorded. (https://results.bikereg.com/race/12340)

**Technical skill requirements:** Jacob [RECREATIONAL]: "The narrow trails had plenty of roots and rocks that proved too much for my skills and gravel bike. I had to walk my bike in more than one spot" in Scotch Creek. Insufficient technical skills on mountain bike sections can slow recreational riders significantly. (https://www.ironbull.org/in-the-news/grinder-2022-race-report-jacob)

**Start atmosphere:** Jacob [RECREATIONAL]: "I felt the electricity at the dawn start. This was by far the largest group I had ever ridden with and the start did not disappoint.

**Aid stations:** Todd Meerdink [COMPETITIVE]: "A few road-side aid stations were setup along the way to offer support. Everything from sweet and salty treats, to Fireball whiskey were available to fuel riders for the day." Also mentioned: "CWOCC board members dressed as lumberjacks" and "a family of elves warned riders of a blind staircase leading down to the creek." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-ironbull-red-granite-grinder-showcases-central-wisconsin-on-an-epic-racecourse/ and https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/2019-ironbull-granite-grinder-race-report-wausau-wisconsin-by-todd-meerdink/)

**Volunteer support:** Race director Shane Hitz: "Riders raved about the course and volunteer support at the finish line." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-ironbull-red-granite-grinder-showcases-central-wisconsin-on-an-epic-racecourse/)

(https://silentsportsmagazine.com/2024/10/05/red-granite-grinder-an-unforgettable-cycling-experience-is-back-in-wausau-on-october-12th/)

**Special access:** "More than a dozen townships and municipalities" granted permissions. "The monumental effort to coordinate the Red Granite Grinder between property owners, law enforcement, vendors, and municipalities required tracking down the right entities, countless hours of planning, and clear lines of communication." First-time bikes were allowed on Rib Mountain State Park trails.
