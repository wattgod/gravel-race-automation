## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Carey Lowery [ELITE]:** "Saturday's course was burly: 66 miles and 9200 feet. And with a good bit of chunky gravel/double track, my 2016 Niner RKT RDO with 2.2 Race Kings was the right bike for the gnar. It had dumped rain the night before, so sections of the course could be particularly spicey." (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2025/04/reliance-deep-woods-gravel-race-stage-1.html)

**Carey Lowery [ELITE]:** "I could not believe how good I was still feeling. The last 13 miles seemed to fly by, standing and hammering the climbs and raging the descents. I tried to stay conservative, as tomorrow was another hard day, but I was having so much fun. I ended up PR'ing the Lost Creek section, too. I rolled into the finish line, 1st Master's and 2nd woman, with a time of 6:07." (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2025/04/reliance-deep-woods-gravel-race-stage-1.html)

**Carey Lowery [ELITE]:** "If you want champagne gravel, head to the middle of the country. If you want to do hard things and destroy your limits, then this race is for YOU!" (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2025/04/reliance-deep-woods-gravel-race-stage-1.html)

**Carey Lowery [ELITE]:** "I spotted a fellow Scott's Bikes jersey and introduced myself. It was Sara Fletcher, who I follow on Strava and kinda knew about, but finally got to meet her in person. We chatted briefly during those pavement miles. After some initial rollers, I felt my legs begin to come around." (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2025/04/reliance-deep-woods-gravel-race-stage-2.html)

**Carey Lowery [ELITE]:** "Along the second half of Fingerboard, with all those short punchy climbs, the wheels started to come off. My low fuel light came on. But I could smell the finish. Just get up this final friggin' tar n chip climb. Ooomph!" (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2025/04/reliance-deep-woods-gravel-race-stage-2.html)

**Carey Lowery [ELITE]:** "Rolling past the JMT trailhead, I was at 4:55. I challenged myself to get to the finish under 5 hours. It hurt like hell, but I managed to squeak it in at 4:59." (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2025/04/reliance-deep-woods-gravel-race-stage-2.html)

**Jon Livengood [ELITE]:** "A mere 65 miles and 8900ft of climbing, 95% gravel (err…not paved), BUT that's only part of the story…the promoter suggested a hardtail as being the best bike for todays gravel. Well since I had my fancy new Lauf with 2.2 tires on it, I figured that's hard tail enough and I was gonna roll with it." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/jons-story-reliance-deep-woods-gravel-grinder)

**Jon Livengood [ELITE]:** "Well then the race takes a turn. We then hit many miles of climbs and descents where a mtb would (and did) shine. Basically the gravel turned to eroded dirt roads with endless embedded rock outcrops-not bad going up, but definitely served a beating for anyone on a gravel bike (including me) going down. 45 minute climb up, then another 30 minute downhill and then I started seeing the mtb's catch me, oh well, I was warned." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/jons-story-reliance-deep-woods-gravel-grinder)

**Jon Livengood [ELITE]:** "Next up was another hour-ish climb and then a super tech downhill…I hung on the best I could on the uphill, but decided not to push it on the down and let the two mtb riders fade away and drop me on the downhill (lost 4 minutes there!)." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/jons-story-reliance-deep-woods-gravel-grinder)

**Jon Livengood [ELITE]:** "Last 10 miles was pristine gravel (for Tennessee) and I powered in feeling strong to the finish with a 5th overall for the day at 5:20 hrs on the bike and 338 TSS!" (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/jons-story-reliance-deep-woods-gravel-grinder)

**Jon Livengood [ELITE]:** "It was a pretty incredible climb as we went through the low hanging clouds and was greeted by a nice sunny day ABOVE the clouds by the top." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/jons-story-reliance-deep-woods-gravel-grinder)

**Jon Livengood [ELITE]:** "Managed to take 1st place in Masters and 5th overall for the race! And, as a podium bonus, we got podium HUGS! Basecamp Winter Program played a big role in ensuring I had a super solid foundation-stoked on that!" (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/jons-story-reliance-deep-woods-gravel-grinder)

**Jon Livengood [ELITE]:** "This was a super well run event and some super solid climbs and competition. Definitely put it on you list for next year. The promoter already said next year will have much less 'rowdy gravel'--yay! Great event!" (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/jons-story-reliance-deep-woods-gravel-grinder)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Carey Lowery [ELITE]:** Used a 2016 Niner RKT RDO (hardtail mountain bike) with 2.2 Race Kings tires for Stage 1. "Wish I woulda tried these tires years ago!" Noted they hooked up well even in wet, muddy conditions on the Smith Mountain climb. (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2025/04/reliance-deep-woods-gravel-race-stage-1.html)

**Carey Lowery [ELITE]:** Switched to a Trek Checkpoint with 45mm Continental Terra Speeds for Stage 2, noting "They would be a little sketch in some areas of the course, but with 23 miles of pavement and mostly smooth'ish gravel (relatively speaking), this bike was gonna be fast." (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2025/04/reliance-deep-woods-gravel-race-stage-2.html)

**Jon Livengood [ELITE]:** Used a Lauf (gravel bike) with 2.2 tires for Stage 1. Noted that "the promoter suggested a hardtail as being the best bike for todays gravel" and acknowledged that mountain bikes had an advantage on technical descents, losing 4 minutes on one super technical downhill. For Stage 2: "The Lauf crush the course today!" (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/jons-story-reliance-deep-woods-gravel-grinder)

**Promoter guidance [UNKNOWN]:** Stage 1 (2025) was described by the promoter as suitable for a hardtail mountain bike due to the technical terrain. (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/jons-story-reliance-deep-woods-gravel-grinder)

**Promoter statement [UNKNOWN]:** After 2025, the promoter indicated next year would have "much less 'rowdy gravel'" suggesting course refinements toward more gravel-bike-friendly terrain. (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/jons-story-reliance-deep-woods-gravel-grinder)

## Weather Experienced

**2025 Stage 1:** "It had dumped rain the night before, so sections of the course could be particularly spicey" with starting temperature of 60 degrees. Smith Mountain climb was "quite wet and a little muddy." Piney Flats was "wet but grippy." (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2025/04/reliance-deep-woods-gravel-race-stage-1.html)

**2025 Stage 2:** Jon Livengood described climbing "through the low hanging clouds and was greeted by a nice sunny day ABOVE the clouds by the top" of the Unicoi Turnpike climb. (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/jons-story-reliance-deep-woods-gravel-grinder)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Stage 1 (66 miles/9200 ft per Carey, 65 miles/8900 ft per Jon) [ELITE perspectives]:**

- Starts with 5 miles of mostly pavement including Childer's Creek and Power House Road with "just that one stiff little climb"
- 3-mile climb after the swinging bridge
- Smith Mountain climb: 6 miles of chunky double track that was wet and muddy in 2025
- Kimsey descent to Piney Flats: "WAY more fun after only 20 miles in your legs as opposed to 120 miles when doing the Dirty 130"
- Piney Flats: "wet but grippy. There were a couple of severely rutted out sections where you had to carefully pick your lines"
- Aid station at mile 32
- 10-mile Wolf Creek-McFarland climb: Wolf Creek section was "smooth, 6-8% average grade," then McFarland continued another 5 miles "with horribly steep pitches, washed out road beds, and chonky bedrock to negotiate"
- Smith Mountain descent (returning via different route)
- Course has "lots of criss-crossing" requiring careful navigation to avoid wrong turns
- Short climb on Lost Creek
- Last 13 miles flew by with climbs and descents

(https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2025/04/reliance-deep-woods-gravel-race-stage-1.html)

**Jon Livengood [ELITE]** described Stage 1 as "95% gravel (err…not paved)" with terrain that "turned to eroded dirt roads with endless embedded rock outcrops-not bad going up, but definitely served a beating for anyone on a gravel bike (including me) going down." Included "45 minute climb up, then another 30 minute downhill" followed by "another hour-ish climb and then a super tech downhill." Last 10 miles was "pristine gravel (for Tennessee)." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/jons-story-reliance-deep-woods-gravel-grinder)

**Stage 2 mix:** "23 miles of pavement and mostly smooth'ish gravel (relatively speaking)" with one technical dirt road sector after the Kimsey climb. (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2025/04/reliance-deep-woods-gravel-race-stage-2.html)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Carey Lowery [ELITE]:** On Stage 1, deliberately didn't chase the fast early start: "The start was faster than my legs wanted to go this early on, but I knew I needed to hang on to enjoy the draft going up Childer's Creek and Power House Road. Five miles of mostly free speed on pavement ... I will take it!" (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2025/04/reliance-deep-woods-gravel-race-stage-1.html)

**Carey Lowery [ELITE]:** Managed effort across two days: "I tried to stay conservative, as tomorrow was another hard day, but I was having so much fun" during Stage 1's final 13 miles. (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2025/04/reliance-deep-woods-gravel-race-stage-1.html)

**Carey Lowery [ELITE]:** Stage 2 start strategy with 45-minute lead: "Having a 45 minute lead over 2nd place, I took it easy and settled in behind a group of ladies." (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2025/04/reliance-deep-woods-gravel-race-stage-2.html)

**Jon Livengood [ELITE]:** "Race stated relatively chill, but on the early paved climb it exploded and the peloton was reduced to small groups of five. I settled into the second group as I knew going deep this early would crush my legs later in the day and drafting does not come into play today." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/jons-story-reliance-deep-woods-gravel-grinder)

**Jon Livengood [ELITE]:** Used wheel-following strategy: Found a rider "riding just slightly harder than me on this climb, so I stuck to his wheel and let him tow me up the mountain. A nice comfortably hard pace, but not one that required any match burning." On Stage 2, employed similar tactics on the Unicoi Turnpike climb. (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/jons-story-reliance-deep-woods-gravel-grinder)

**Jon Livengood [ELITE]:** Stage 2 chase dynamics: "At maybe mile 40 I almost reeled in 3rd place coming into the aid station, but unfortunately he rolled through it while I had to stop to get some for fluids…heartbreaker as his tiny <10 second lead now jumped to 40 sec. The last 20 miles...I put my head down and for each steep hill we hit, I could see I was reeling him in a little. I got to within 10sec of him on the last steep up, but just couldn't close the gap." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/jons-story-reliance-deep-woods-gravel-grinder)

**Carey Lowery [ELITE]:** Final effort on Stage 2: "Rolling past the JMT trailhead, I was at 4:55. I challenged myself to get to the finish under 5 hours. It hurt like hell, but I managed to squeak it in at 4:59." (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2025/04/reliance-deep-woods-gravel-race-stage-2.html)

**Jon Livengood [ELITE]:** Training load recorded: Stage 1 = 338 TSS at 5:20 ride time; Stage 2 = 278 TSS at 4:00 ride time. (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/jons-story-reliance-deep-woods-gravel-grinder)

**Carey Lowery [ELITE]:** Aid station strategy varied: Stage 1 - "stopped briefly to eat a banana and refill one bottle" at mile 32, then "passed by the aid station without stopping" on the return; Stage 2 - quick stop at Unicoi Gap where "Matt partially filled a bottle for me. I was in and out in less than 20 seconds." (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2025/04/reliance-deep-woods-gravel-race-stage-1.html and https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2025/04/reliance-deep-woods-gravel-race-stage-2.html)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Navigation errors:** Carey observed: "When the course has lots of criss-crossing, you have got to be astute in doing your homework, as well as watching for the upcoming turns, so that you don't end up repeating a section or going backwards on the course." She witnessed Randy Kerr accidentally ride the Piney Flats section twice instead of coming down Smith Mountain. (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2025/04/reliance-deep-woods-gravel-race-stage-1.html)

**Mechanical risk on technical descents:** Carey noted on Stage 2's Ditney descent: "Those 4.4 miles I settled into a conservative 'don't wanna flat' speed. Halfway in, I came across two ladies, one helping the other who had flatted. I think I may have slowed down a bit more after that." (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2025/04/reliance-deep-woods-gravel-race-stage-2.html)

**Bike choice consequences [ELITE perspective]:** Jon Livengood on Stage 1: Gravel bikes with 2.2" tires took "a beating" on technical descents with embedded rock outcrops, losing significant time to mountain bikes. Lost 4 minutes on one super technical downhill to MTB riders. (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/jons-story-reliance-deep-woods-gravel-grinder)

**Bonking risk [ELITE perspective]:** Carey described Stage 2 struggle: "Along the second half of Fingerboard, with all those short punchy climbs, the wheels started to come off. My low fuel light came on." (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2025/04/reliance-deep-woods-gravel-race-stage-2.html)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Shannon Burke [UNKNOWN]:** Founded the event and "operates TennesseeGravel.com." In its second year (2025), he "had upped the game" with more sponsors. (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2025/04/reliance-deep-woods-gravel-race-stage-1.html)

**Carey Lowery [ELITE]:** "This was as much a festival as it was a race" with options to "clean up at the campground, chow down on some grub, and have a beer or NA beer, or two" afterward. (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2025/04/reliance-deep-woods-gravel-race-stage-1.html)

**Carey Lowery [ELITE]:** Met fellow competitors: "Chelsie Tan had finished in 6:04. I had heard about her and finally got to meet her. Tiny, she's lucky is she stands 5'1", but I bet her watts/kg is phenomenal. Previously a World Tour level athlete, she has found that mountain biking is much more fun." Also met Sara Fletcher during Stage 2: "I follow on Strava and kinda knew about, but finally got to meet her in person. We chatted briefly during those pavement miles." (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2025/04/reliance-deep-woods-gravel-race-stage-1.html and https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2025/04/reliance-deep-woods-gravel-race-stage-2.html)

**Jon Livengood [ELITE]:** "And, as a podium bonus, we got podium HUGS!" (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/jons-story-reliance-deep-woods-gravel-grinder)

**Carey Lowery [ELITE]:** Thanked organizers: "Once again, I want to thank Shannon and Celeste for a wonderful weekend of fun sprinkled with a wee bit of suffering." (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2025/04/reliance-deep-woods-gravel-race-stage-2.html)

**Old-school timing:** Carey noted: "I had to yell out my number at the finish. This was old school watch timing. And the timer was busy talking to someone who had finished just before me 😆." (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2025/04/reliance-deep-woods-gravel-race-stage-2.html)

**Course improvements:** Carey observed: "This year's Day 1 course was so much better than last year's. Long climbs and technical descents made for a great day of racing and adventure in my backyard." The promoter told riders "next year will have much less 'rowdy gravel'" indicating listener-responsive course evolution. (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2025/04/reliance-deep-woods-gravel-race-stage-1.html and https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/jons-story-reliance-deep-woods-gravel-grinder)

**Prizes:** Winners received cash, "a cool trophy, and a free entry to next year's race." (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2025/04/reliance-deep-woods-gravel-race-stage-2.html)

**Event growth:** Attracted 155 participants in 2025 from 26 different states according to sponsor materials. (https://www.tennesseegravel.com/reliance-sponsor)

**Beneficiary:** Event benefits SORBA Chattanooga (local mountain bike association). (https://www.tennesseegravel.com/reliance-sponsor)

**Geographic appeal:** JOM of Gravel Cyclist described it as part of Tennessee gravel hotspot events: "A big weekend of grassroots gravel cycling in the Cherokee National Forest, very close to Chattanooga, Tennessee. There are ride and race options, with the race options being over two days, and totaling 115 miles in total… with 15,000 feet of elevation. Yikes!"
