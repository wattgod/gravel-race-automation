# RELIANCE TENNESSEE GRAVEL — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Carey Lowery [ELITE]:** "Saturday's course was burly: 66 miles and 9200 feet. And with a good bit of chunky gravel/double track, my 2016 Niner RKT RDO with 2.2 Race Kings was the right bike for the gnar... The Smith Mountain climb was a beast at 6 miles of chunky double track... I could not believe how good I was still feeling. The last 13 miles seemed to fly by, standing and hammering the climbs and raging the descents... I ended up PR'ing the Lost Creek section, too. I rolled into the finish line, 1st Master's and 2nd woman, with a time of 6:07." (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2025/04/reliance-deep-woods-gravel-race-stage-1.html)

**Carey Lowery [ELITE]:** On Day 2: "This year's Day 1 course was so much better than last year's. Long climbs and technical descents made for a great day of racing and adventure in my backyard. If you want champagne gravel, head to the middle of the country. If you want to do hard things and destroy your limits, then this race is for YOU!" (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2025/04/reliance-deep-woods-gravel-race-stage-1.html)

**Mike (Mike's Outdoor Blog) [ELITE]:** "Saturday morning I lined up with 80 some of the 100 registered racers... 5 miles in we started our first of MANY climbs. We wound through some AMAZING roads... I slowed to take a switch-back and came around the corner to find some loose gravel on some slick-rock. My front wheel slid out at about 20 mph and I did a face-first slide for a few feet down the chunky gravel road... I managed to complete the 66 miles with only one wrong turn and one crash. The climbs seemed to never end. In 66 miles we climbed 8800'... I finished in 23rd place." (https://gumbi1.wordpress.com/2024/06/01/reliance-gravel/)

**Mike [ELITE]:** On Day 2: "Sunday dawned and I wasn't sure if I would be able to do the race route due to scabs and stiffness from my injuries... In the first 16 miles we climbed for all but 3 minutes. At 5 miles in we started an 11 mile climb. There were a couple of sections where it flattened, but there was no descending for 11 miles... At one point we were sent up a 5 mile climb filled with switchbacks that arrived at the top of Buck Bald where we were greeted with an aid station and a 360° view of the surrounding mountains... 100 registrants, 80-some started, and only 38 finished. I am happy to say I was one of the 38... I was 21st place. To top it off I managed 11th place in the KOM competition on the 11 mile climb!" (https://gumbi1.wordpress.com/2024/06/01/reliance-gravel/)

**Gus Wolf [COMPETITIVE]:** On the Dirty 130 ITT (related route): "What a friggin bruiser! So many learning lessons! I got up at 5 am, worked a full day and drove out to the start point. Started Pedaling around 6pm ish. My plan was to complete in 24 hours..." (https://www.tennesseegravel.com/ride-reports)

**Audrey Mace [COMPETITIVE]:** On Tellico Highlands ITT: "I started around 6 am on the fourth of July and rolled out with Ali and Beth - we all did our own paces and had separate days as soon as the Kimsey climb started, but it was nice to roll out with other people! I watched the sun rise on Kimsey and it was amazing..." (https://www.tennesseegravel.com/ride-reports)

**Randy Kerr [COMPETITIVE]:** On Death March Revival: "Death March Revival - love this route! Yet, another a showcase of God's creations in Cherokee national Forest Cohutta Wilderness created by Kim Murrell..." (https://www.tennesseegravel.com/ride-reports)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Carey Lowery [ELITE]:** "With a good bit of chunky gravel/double track, my 2016 Niner RKT RDO with 2.2 Race Kings was the right bike for the gnar. It had dumped rain the night before, so sections of the course could be particularly spicey... The Smith Mountain climb was a beast at 6 miles of chunky double track. Fortunately, I was having a great day and ended up passing another woman on a short descent. This section was quite wet and a little muddy, but the Kings were hooking up well. Wish I woulda tried these tires years ago!" (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2025/04/reliance-deep-woods-gravel-race-stage-1.html)

**Mike [ELITE]:** Notes that gravel bikes can handle the course, but also mentions: "Saturday saw some sections that were more fit for a full squish mountain bike than a gravel bike. If it had not been a race I would have stopped to take pics of some of the stuff we rode on those bikes or the beautiful views." (https://gumbi1.wordpress.com/2024/06/01/reliance-gravel/)

**Course Officials:** Official 2026 route guidance states: "While there's no avoiding chunky sections in the forest, the race routes skip the worst offenders from the last two years (Smith Mtn Road, among others) and is doable on a gravel bike." (https://www.tennesseegravel.com/reliance-routes)

## Weather Experienced

**Carey Lowery [ELITE] - 2025:** "It had dumped rain the night before, so sections of the course could be particularly spicey... The starting temperature was 60 degrees ... perfect!" Saturday conditions were ideal after overnight rain. (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2025/04/reliance-deep-woods-gravel-race-stage-1.html)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Carey Lowery [ELITE]:** "5 miles of mostly free speed on pavement ... I will take it! Just that one stiff little climb, where I was able to pull away from a few ladies, as the diesel engine was warmed up... The 3 mile climb after the swinging bridge went by quickly... The Smith Mountain climb was a beast at 6 miles of chunky double track... I followed Scott, aka 'Sugar,' down the Kimsey descent to Piney Flats. This descent is WAY more fun after only 20 miles in your legs as opposed to 120 miles when doing the Dirty 130. Piney Flats was wet but grippy. There were a couple of severely rutted out sections where you had to carefully pick your lines." (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2025/04/reliance-deep-woods-gravel-race-stage-1.html)

**Carey Lowery [ELITE]:** "Then I was off to tackle the 10 mile Wolf Creek-McFarland climb. The Wolf Creek section was smooth, 6-8 % average grade. Legs were still sparkly ... huzzah! From there, I made the right turn onto McFarland and continued climbing another 5 miles, but with horribly steep pitches, washed out road beds, and chonky bedrock to negotiate." (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2025/04/reliance-deep-woods-gravel-race-stage-1.html)

**Mike [ELITE]:** "5 miles in we started our first of MANY climbs. We wound through some AMAZING roads. As our route took us near the top of a mountain those of us doing the race route were sent to the right to continue our way up the mountain, then back to the base of the climb to do it all over again. Our second time around the descent and I had lost the female racer I had been with for several miles. I was pushing the descent a little more since I had already seen it once. We had seen speeds of nearly 40 mph in a few spots. I slowed to take a switch-back and came around the corner to find some loose gravel on some slick-rock. My front wheel slid out at about 20 mph." (https://gumbi1.wordpress.com/2024/06/01/reliance-gravel/)

**Mike [ELITE]:** "In the first 16 miles we climbed for all but 3 minutes. At 5 miles in we started an 11 mile climb. There were a couple of sections where it flattened, but there was no descending for 11 miles... At one point we were sent up a 5 mile climb filled with switchbacks that arrived at the top of Buck Bald where we were greeted with an aid station and a 360° view of the surrounding mountains." (https://gumbi1.wordpress.com/2024/06/01/reliance-gravel/)

**Course Officials:** On the 72-mile route: "Saturday's long race route follows the 46-mile route all the way to mile 40 before working its way across a few paved roads to the base of Starr Mountain for a beautiful but challenging 4-mile climb. While the top of the climb doesn't have a view like Buck Bald, you'll still have a sweet reward in the form of a super fun descent... Watch for the right turn to stay on Fingerboard around mile 35. It's easy to miss!" (https://www.tennesseegravel.com/reliance-routes)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Carey Lowery [ELITE]:** "The start was faster than my legs wanted to go this early on, but I knew I needed to hang on to enjoy the draft going up Childer's Creek and Power House Road. 5 miles of mostly free speed on pavement ... I will take it!... The aid station was at mile 32. I stopped briefly to eat a banana and refill one bottle... I tried to stay conservative, as tomorrow was another hard day, but I was having so much fun." Finished Day 1 in 6:07. (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2025/04/reliance-deep-woods-gravel-race-stage-1.html)

**Carey Lowery [ELITE]:** Navigation note: "When the course has lots of criss-crossing, you have got to be astute in doing your homework, as well as watching for the upcoming turns, so that you don't end up repeating a section or going backwards on the course." She witnessed Randy Kerr accidentally ride Piney Flats twice. (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2025/04/reliance-deep-woods-gravel-race-stage-1.html)

**Mike [ELITE]:** "I put down as much food as I could to prepare to do another ride first thing in the morning." After finishing Day 1 in 23rd place, struggled with sleep due to crash injuries. (https://gumbi1.wordpress.com/2024/06/01/reliance-gravel/)

**Mike [ELITE]:** Day 2 strategy: "After a short conversation I found she [a local female racer] was descending well and knew what was coming up next. I would drop her on the short little climbs, and she would hang on the descents. We only had a couple of miles left and we hit pavement. Since we had been going along for a while we rolled across the line together." Finished 21st overall, 11th on the 11-mile KOM climb. (https://gumbi1.wordpress.com/2024/06/01/reliance-gravel/)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Mike [ELITE]:** Crashes are a real risk: "I slowed to take a switch-back and came around the corner to find some loose gravel on some slick-rock. My front wheel slid out at about 20 mph and I did a face-first slide for a few feet down the chunky gravel road. As I sat up I realized my bell had been rung pretty well and began to worry about concussion." He finished despite the crash but noted: "blood on my hands, legs and one arm as I rolled into camp." (https://gumbi1.wordpress.com/2024/06/01/reliance-gravel/)

**Mike [ELITE]:** High attrition rate: "100 registrants, 80-some started, and only 38 finished. I am happy to say I was one of the 38." This represents a 52.5% DNF rate among starters. (https://gumbi1.wordpress.com/2024/06/01/reliance-gravel/)

**Carey Lowery [ELITE]:** Navigation errors: Randy Kerr "had ridden the Piney Flats section twice instead of coming down Smith. Man, I hated it for him. When the course has lots of criss-crossing, you have got to be astute in doing your homework, as well as watching for the upcoming turns." (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2025/04/reliance-deep-woods-gravel-race-stage-1.html)

**Course Officials:** "The routes will NOT be marked. It is therefore imperative that you download the routes before you arrive at the event... Watch for the right turn to stay on Fingerboard around mile 35. It's easy to miss!" and "Watch for the left turn onto Piney Flats around mile 9. It's easy to miss!" (https://www.tennesseegravel.com/reliance-routes)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Carey Lowery [ELITE]:** "I got to meet her [Chelsie Tan]. Tiny, she's lucky is she stands 5'1", but I bet her watts/kg is phenomenal. Previously a World Tour level athlete, she has found that mountain biking is much more fun. And today's course was a mountain bike course, for sure! Unfortunately, I could not stay and join in the afternoon camraderie and festivities, as I had to go home to let the kids out." (https://careylowery.blogspot.com/2025/04/reliance-deep-woods-gravel-race-stage-1.html)

**Mike [ELITE]:** "Sometimes you do an event or go to a race that reminds you why you enjoy the bike so much. It's a freedom machine that can take you anywhere as long as you're willing to put in the energy to get there. Reliance Gravel was this type of race." He also noted: "After checking in and talking to a few people about OGR we found our VERY densely forested site... Ollie [his dog] had not been a fan of the drive, but once we made it to camp he was pretty content." (https://gumbi1.wordpress.com/2024/06/01/reliance-gravel/)

**Mike [ELITE]:** "As I rolled into the finish line in 23rd place the race director came to ask me if I was OK. He had gotten word on the radio of my wreck." Shows attentive race organization and safety monitoring. (https://gumbi1.wordpress.com/2024/06/01/reliance-gravel/)

**Course Officials:** From the official site: "This was as much a festival as it was a race... you could clean up at the campground, chow down on some grub, and have a beer or NA beer, or two." The event description emphasizes: "Amazing Scenery, Grassroots Camaraderie, Good Food & Tasty Beer!" (https://www.tennesseegravel.com/reliance)

**Mike [ELITE]:** "I've never experienced a race like this. It was so beautiful and so much fun and I'm anxious to go back and try to do better." (https://gumbi1.wordpress.com/2024/06/01/reliance-gravel/)
