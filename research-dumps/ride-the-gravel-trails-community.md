# RIDE THE GRAVEL TRAILS — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

### TPU Tubes as Emergency Backup
**Jeff Barber [UNKNOWN]:** Testing multiple TPU tube brands for emergency use: "All have proven to be up to the job of getting me back to the car without having to limp back on a flat or under-inflated tire." Tested at 25psi starting pressure on Maxxis Minion DHR II with Double Down casing. Notes that Tubolito ($32.95, 81.8g) is heaviest but most durable, while budget options like Cyclami ($7.88/tube, 63.7g) and Ridenow ($10.99/tube, 52.8g) work adequately for emergencies. Key finding: "Tubeless is still the way to go whenever possible." (https://www.singletracks.com/mtb-gear/6-tpu-inner-tubes-trail-tested/)

### Gravel Bike Gearing Considerations
**robbbby [UNKNOWN]:** Debating between road-oriented gearing (52/36 with 11/28 cassette) versus gravel-oriented gearing (48/32 with 11/32 cassette). Forum discussion notes: "The diverge has 25% lower bottom gearing. That's HUGE if you're climbing long hills, with gear, or offroad." Another forum member notes that lower gearing helps prevent spinning the rear wheel on loose climbs. (https://forums.clubsi.com/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&Number=8841842)

**robbbby [UNKNOWN]:** Ultimately purchased Colnago CX Zero with 50/34 and 11-28 gearing, noting this was preferred over mountain bike-style gearing for mixed terrain use. Bike accommodates 25mm tires officially, though reviews suggest 28-30mm possible. (https://forums.clubsi.com/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&Number=8841842)

### Bike Setup for Mixed Terrain
**Timo Rokitta [RECREATIONAL]:** Used gravel bike for 130km GiRodeo ride with 2,500m elevation gain through varied terrain including stream crossings and 15% gradient climbs. Experienced mechanical issue with seatpost bolt breaking mid-ride, highlighting importance of pre-ride equipment checks. (https://gravelunion.cc/article/saddling-up-for-the-GiRodeo-gravel-ride)

### Tire Selection Philosophy
**dirtyS13drifta [UNKNOWN]:** On tire width for gravel versus road: "I wouldn't say a tarmac CAN'T ride gravel, but with 23mm it won't be as much fun. Between stiff tires and short-wheel base, and fast steering it'll feel like more work." Recommends wider tires for gravel comfort and capability.

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

### GiRodeo Gravel Ride, Girona
**Timo Rokitta [RECREATIONAL]:** Course details from actual ride: "On a short climb, one of my seatpost bolts breaks and my saddle suddenly falls to the ground." Describes technical challenge: "We have to shoulder our bikes to cross over a small stream. Three small wooden pallets have to be managed on foot in order not to get wet feet. When I step on the second pallet, it suddenly tips over and I fall into the water with my bike." 

Climbing section: "Brutal ramps with 15% gradients alternate with short flat parts, the ascent is very un-rhythmic to ride. At 850 meters I'm finally up to the summit." Descent conditions: "A fast descent follows, initially on loose gravel with concrete serpentine-like curves."

Total ride: "After almost 130 kilometers and 2,500 meters of altitude gain, I'm back in Girona." (https://gravelunion.cc/article/saddling-up-for-the-GiRodeo-gravel-ride)

### Tour de Mir Gravel Ride
**Pyrenees Cycling Club [RECREATIONAL-focused tour operator]:** 52km route with 700m climbing to La Tour de Mir signal tower, followed by 800m vertical descent. Route description: "you'll ride through chestnut and pine forests, past shepherds and mushroom pickers, and reach open ridges with epic views." Terrain mix includes "narrow cobbled streets" at start, "15 km climb," "mixed-surface descending," and "final 20 km are rolling tarmac along the river."

### Col de Coustouges
**Pyrenees Cycling Club [RECREATIONAL-focused tour operator]:** 13km climb, 492m elevation gain to 821m summit. Described as "gateway climb" that "welcomes everyone." Character note: "This is a climb that often doesn't feel like you're climbing!" (https://fr.linkedin.com/company/pyrenees-cycling-club)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

### GiRodeo Event Culture
**Timo Rokitta [RECREATIONAL]:** Pre-ride scene: "When I arrive, it is early so it's still dark, but there is a lot of activity in front of the TSC shop in Girona. Gravel bikers come from all directions to register for the GiRodeo. Almost everyone then allows themselves a short caffeine booster in the Oniria coffee shop before they start."

Rider support culture: "A nice gravel biker from France (thanks a lot Simon) picks it up and brings it to me. Nil from TSC happens to be in the next corner and helps me with the repairs." Later: "Some friendly gravel bikers pull me out of the cold water."

Elite participation: "some top stars of the cycling scene like Simon Gerrans, George Bennet, Sam Bewley, Esteban Chaves, Alice and Hannah Barnes, Alexey Vermeulen, Daryl Impey, Ollie Woods, Brent Bookwalter are at the start of the GiRodeo."

Pace dynamics: "Diederick Deelen, who finished fourth in the TRAKA 360 in spring and the blogger Sami Sauri ride the gravel trails at 35 km/h and this is supposed to be a social ride!" (https://gravelunion.cc/article/saddling-up-for-the-GiRodeo-gravel-ride)

### Girona Cycling Culture
**Timo Rokitta [RECREATIONAL]:** "Girona is known as a cycling mecca... Cyclists have the right of way when it is signposted. And indeed, on the streets, drivers keep a safe distance - there is no jostling or honking." Climate benefits: "It hardly ever rains and even in winter it doesn't get much colder than ten degrees. Since the sun is constantly shining, it feels much warmer." (https://gravelunion.cc/article/saddling-up-for-the-GiRodeo-gravel-ride)

## DNF Risk Factors

### Mechanical Issues
**Timo Rokitta [RECREATIONAL]:** "On a short climb, one of my seatpost bolts breaks and my saddle suddenly falls to the ground." Required 10-minute trailside repair with help from event support. Also experienced unplanned water crossing failure: "When I step on the second pallet, it suddenly tips over and I fall into the water with my bike." (https://gravelunion.cc/article/saddling-up-for-the-GiRodeo-gravel-ride)

### Pace Management
**Timo Rokitta [RECREATIONAL]:** Pacing issue: "Group 2 rides at a much higher pace and I have to pedal hard to follow." Later on climb: "The attack comes on the following mountain, the pace of the group is so high that many riders can no longer keep up. I also have to let go - the pace is way too high for me." Demonstrates risk of trying to stay with faster groups beyond one's capability. (https://gravelunion.cc/article/saddling-up-for-the-GiRodeo-gravel-ride)
