# ROCK COBBLER — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**webdev511 [COMPETITIVE]:** "Well that was fun, not. I got two red days followed by a yellow day, so yeah it was a big day on the bike. 75.9 miles and 9k feet of climbing in 9h 1m total elapsed time. One crash at mile 20, and a porta potty stop at mile 31. So not bad. Considering I just finished the first base phase of my training plan. The new hike-a-bike sucked ass." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/rock-cobbler-2025/99924)

**ndmufc [COMPETITIVE]:** "I had 155km and 3804m of climbing for the Boulder Super tough day on the bike for me. I'd spent the early part of the week throwing up and unable to keep any food down. Considered pulling out but glad I didn't, although I didn't get anywhere near the performance I could have done if I hadn't been ill. The surprise LeMans start at the beginning of the Boulder was a fun way to start That Hike-A-Bike was something else though" (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/rock-cobbler-2025/99924)

**Peter Stetina [ELITE]:** "The Rock Cobbler is the kookiest bike race I've ever done. It's unclassifiable. One minute you're on nice surface and the next you're slip sliding down a scree field, or just plain old riding through a field dodging cattle. There are 30 per cent run ups, WhiteClaw hand ups, ball pits, and it's brutally difficult" (https://rockcobbler.com/)

**Peter Stetina [ELITE]:** "In one word, kooky. We found ourself grinding along massive ridge lines only to make random turns down livestock paths and sandy washes, dodging cow patties and rocks... at no point it time did the course feel straightforward." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/road/road-culture/groad-trip-bulls-ball-pits-and-bucket-lists-at-the-rock-cobbler/)

**Sam Ames (Race Director) [UNKNOWN]:** "It's not a race. I am always quick to correct people! Many of the Cobbler Crew raced road, cross and MTB's for decades... We never wanted to deal with podiums, prize money, etc. We did want a damn hard ride but pitting the rider against the course was first and then having fun telling war stories, beers and food was what we also wanted." (https://www.progravelmagazine.com/post/fomo-factory-why-the-rock-cobbler-the-ultimate-race-to-miss)

**Wil Matthews [COMPETITIVE]:** "In reality, this is probably a really bad idea… there aren't any 30%+ grades or insane hike-a-bikes and other dodgy roads in NorFLA." (https://www.progravelmagazine.com/post/fomo-factory-why-the-rock-cobbler-the-ultimate-race-to-miss)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**webdev511 [COMPETITIVE]:** "I'll be running my Scalpel HT and currently leaning towards running 2.1 thunder burt f/r and a 32t front because 8k of climbing and I'm 95kg… Outside chance I could be talked into a 2.35 Ray F/ 2.4 Rick R, but the Burts are so crazy fast." Notes rider weight at 95kg and is prioritizing fast-rolling tires despite technical terrain. (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/rock-cobbler-2025/99924)

**webdev511 [COMPETITIVE]:** "Might be tempted to go wider if it doesn't rain. Bakersfield can be pretty sandy, but it's not Fort Ord sandy." Suggesting tire width choice depends on conditions. (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/rock-cobbler-2025/99924)

**Race Organizers [UNKNOWN]:** "The advice from the organizers suggest a gravel bike with low gearing or mtb." Official guidance emphasizes the need for low gears due to climbing. (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/rock-cobbler-2025/99924)

**Peter Stetina [ELITE]:** "Chris Blevins was in attendance and was on his full-suspension mountain bike with gravel tires. He dropped us on every downhill with his impressive bike handling." Elite-level rider chose full-suspension MTB for technical descents. (https://velo.outsideonline.com/road/road-culture/groad-trip-bulls-ball-pits-and-bucket-lists-at-the-rock-cobbler/)

**JOM [UNKNOWN]:** Built a hybrid setup with "Rockshox Reverb AXS Wireless Dropper with Shimano GRX Di2" and "Standard GRX 48/31 2x gearing" with "SRAM 11-36 11-speed cassette" on "650b wheels". This unconventional wireless dropper + Di2 combo suggests technical descents benefit from dropper posts. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/videos/my-bike-for-the-2023-rock-cobbler-rockshox-reverb-axs-wireless-dropper-with-shimano-grx-di2/)

**General observation:** There is NO perfect bike for Rock Cobbler. MTB is mentioned as a good choice, but riders run everything from hardtails to gravel bikes with droppers.

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Peter Stetina [ELITE]:** "We found ourself grinding along massive ridge lines only to make random turns down livestock paths and sandy washes, dodging cow patties and rocks." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/road/road-culture/groad-trip-bulls-ball-pits-and-bucket-lists-at-the-rock-cobbler/)

**Peter Stetina [ELITE]:** "The 30 percent run-ups, the rollercoaster MTB trail, and the ball pit" are classic Rock Cobbler features encountered late in the race. (https://velo.outsideonline.com/road/road-culture/groad-trip-bulls-ball-pits-and-bucket-lists-at-the-rock-cobbler/)

**Sam Ames (Race Director) [UNKNOWN]:** "I think we might have 500 yards of 'gravel roads.' Seeing the oilfields, ranches and cattle along with orchards and the rugged terrain of eastern Bakersfield is definitely the embodiment of that terrain." The race has almost NO traditional gravel roads. (https://www.progravelmagazine.com/post/fomo-factory-why-the-rock-cobbler-the-ultimate-race-to-miss)

**Course Features [UNKNOWN]:** The race "travels through a cowboy bar" and includes "riding thru a house, bars, doing push ups, a ridiculous hike a bike." Course changes every year with access to private ranch land available only one day per year. (https://www.progravelmagazine.com/post/fomo-factory-why-the-rock-cobbler-the-ultimate-race-to-miss)

**Peter Stetina [ELITE]:** On the biggest climb, "I was expecting another ludicrous descent afterwards where he'd catch me and we'd be on the same terms. To my surprise the descent was paved" - indicating unpredictable surface transitions. (https://velo.outsideonline.com/road/road-culture/groad-trip-bulls-ball-pits-and-bucket-lists-at-the-rock-cobbler/)

**webdev511 [COMPETITIVE]:** "The new hike-a-bike sucked ass" and ndmufc posted photos showing extremely steep, technical terrain requiring bike carrying. (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/rock-cobbler-2025/99924)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**webdev511 [COMPETITIVE]:** Finished Cobbler (75.9 miles, 9k climbing) in 9h 1m elapsed time "Considering I just finished the first base phase of my training plan" - suggesting this rider was NOT in peak fitness and still completed in sub-10 hours. (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/rock-cobbler-2025/99924)

**ndmufc [COMPETITIVE]:** Finished Boulder (155km, 3804m climbing) while recovering from illness earlier in the week, noting "I didn't get anywhere near the performance I could have done if I hadn't been ill." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/rock-cobbler-2025/99924)

**Peter Stetina [ELITE]:** "I finally sampled my first ever WhiteClaw hard seltzer after only 30 miles from a costumed hand-up. One big gulp was enough for me, though; I'll stick with my beers from now on!" Elite racer encountering party atmosphere at mile 30. (https://velo.outsideonline.com/road/road-culture/groad-trip-bulls-ball-pits-and-bucket-lists-at-the-rock-cobbler/)

**Peter Stetina [ELITE]:** Strategic racing note: "on the biggest climb of the day I went all in to try and put him on the back foot. I was expecting another ludicrous descent afterwards... To my surprise the descent was paved, so I put it in the big ring and continued to pour it on, knowing he was limited by his smaller MTB gears." Elite strategy involved attacking on climbs when paired against MTB gearing. (https://velo.outsideonline.com/road/road-culture/groad-trip-bulls-ball-pits-and-bucket-lists-at-the-rock-cobbler/)

**Sam Ames (Race Director) [UNKNOWN]:** "the course is hard, very hard, and there are a lot of unknowns out there. It's OK to walk and to even cut the course, the only caveat being that if you do, let them know so you don't mess with the results that others do care about." Official pre-race guidance acknowledges difficulty and normalizes walking/course-cutting. (https://velo.outsideonline.com/road/road-culture/groad-trip-bulls-ball-pits-and-bucket-lists-at-the-rock-cobbler/)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Wildlife encounters:** "Encountering animals here is a reality" on private ranch lands. The 2022 bull incident was significant enough to generate viral video coverage. (https://velo.outsideonline.com/road/road-culture/groad-trip-bulls-ball-pits-and-bucket-lists-at-the-rock-cobbler/)

**Technical terrain:** Multiple mentions of "30 percent run-ups" and "ridiculous hike a bike" sections that are unrideable even for elite riders. (https://velo.outsideonline.com/road/road-culture/groad-trip-bulls-ball-pits-and-bucket-lists-at-the-rock-cobbler/)

**webdev511 [COMPETITIVE]:** "One crash at mile 20" - early-race crash risk on technical terrain. (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/rock-cobbler-2025/99924)

**Course unpredictability:** "at no point it time did the course feel straightforward" and route changes every year, making pre-riding or course knowledge difficult. (https://velo.outsideonline.com/road/road-culture/groad-trip-bulls-ball-pits-and-bucket-lists-at-the-rock-cobbler/)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Sam Ames (Race Director) [UNKNOWN]:** "the Cobbler has really become a gathering and a party. That is very important to us." and "We had riders in jean shorts and work boots doing the Pebbler. That shows a broad appeal from kitted up gravel racer to an 'I think I can do this' recreational rider." (https://www.progravelmagazine.com/post/fomo-factory-why-the-rock-cobbler-the-ultimate-race-to-miss)

**Venue:** "The host venue is the Kern County Museum, an homage to comforting Americana of years gone by... Come sunset during registration, the lights turn on and riders are treated to Coors Banquet beers and bottled juices during packet pickup." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/road/road-culture/groad-trip-bulls-ball-pits-and-bucket-lists-at-the-rock-cobbler/)

**Peter Stetina [ELITE]:** "Beers and storytelling at the venue ensued. The tale of the angry bull on course was unveiled to the shock of all and, true to his word, Sam gave me my 'you're not special' winner's prize: A beach chair and towel. Super useful for landlocked Bakersfield, I know." Winner gets random/joke prizes, not traditional trophies. (https://velo.outsideonline.com/road/road-culture/groad-trip-bulls-ball-pits-and-bucket-lists-at-the-rock-cobbler/)

**Race ethos:** "There is a race factor but it's an afterthought; there is no podium ceremony, and the winner gets a random trophy." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/road/road-culture/groad-trip-bulls-ball-pits-and-bucket-lists-at-the-rock-cobbler/)

**Sam Ames (Race Director) [UNKNOWN]:** "We spend a lot of money on our Cobblers to give them the best food, fun and value with swag and the 'special gift.' It was never meant to be a race and never will." (https://www.progravelmagazine.com/post/fomo-factory-why-the-rock-cobbler-the-ultimate-race-to-miss)

**Wil Matthews [COMPETITIVE]:** "the FOMO of Rock Cobbler is unstoppable" and captures "something that is bordering on the mystical: spirit" in contrast to more corporate gravel events. (https://www.progravelmagazine.com/post/fomo-factory-why-the-rock-cobbler-the-ultimate-race-to-miss)

**Camping/Festival:** "festivities Friday night at the start and finish area that doubles as a campground for the many racers who use the event as a convenient winter escape." (https://www.progravelmagazine.com/post/fomo-factory-why-the-rock-cobbler-the-ultimate-race-to-miss)

**ndmufc [COMPETITIVE]:** Posts photo evidence showing riders giving the race director the middle finger post-race, which Sam Ames notes is "now traditional... when it's over for the hike-a-bike." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/rock-cobbler-2025/99924)
