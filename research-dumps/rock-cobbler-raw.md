## 2. RACE HISTORY & FOUNDING

### Origins
- **Conception**: Fall 2012, "on a cow trail" when 3 buddies wanted to showcase mixed terrain riding
- **First Edition**: February 2013, Rock Cobbler 1.0 launched with 40 riders
- **Founder**: Sam Ames, owner of Action Sports and SamBarn Promotions
- **Philosophy**: "Conceived by drunken madmen on barstools in the dark hours of the night"

### Sam Ames Background
- Involved in racing and promoting cycling events since 1985
- SamBarn Promotions launched in 2008
- Has produced championship road, cross, and mountain bike events in Kern County
- Inspired by the Belgian Waffle Ride, his love for adventure, and his Bakersfield roots
- Chief Excitement Officer mantra: "It's a stupidly hard bike ride" (said with a shrug)

### Growth & Cult Following
- Grew from 40 riders in 2013 to attracting participants from across the globe
- Rated by Strambecco as one of the Best Gravel Cycling Race Events in California and the Southwest
- 2023 was version 10.0, 2024 was 11.0, 2025 was 12.0
- The Boulder option (115 miles, 10,000+ ft) added starting in 2024, limited to 50 riders

### Event Philosophy
> "We did want a damn hard ride but pitting the rider against the course was first and then having fun telling war stories, beers and food was what we also wanted. For those that want to race and make money doing it, there are plenty of events doing that."

> "We spend a lot of money on our Cobblers to give them the best food, fun and value with swag and the 'special gift.' It was never meant to be a race and never will. We had riders in jean shorts and work boots doing the Pebbler."

## 3. TERRAIN & COURSE

### Course Composition
The multi-surface course consists of:
- County asphalt roads
- Trails and single track
- Private ranchland (special access granted only for race day)
- Technical challenges
- Ridiculous amount of punchy steep climbs
- Rolling hills
- River crossing
- Creek crossing
- Cowboy bar (Ethel's Old Corral Cafe)
- Various creative shenanigans

### What Makes It Unique
- **Riding through a house**: Yes, literally through someone's house with donut hand-ups
- **Cowboy bar**: Navigate through customers at Ethel's Old Corral Cafe
- **Ball pits, push-up contests, White Claw hand-ups**
- **"Tacoman"**: Mysterious course character
- **Livestock encounters**: Bulls have charged at riders
- **Annual surprises**: Course changes every year with new features
- **Private land access**: Ranchland closed to cyclists 364 days/year

### Hike-a-Bike Sections
- Famous for vertical hike-a-bike sections
- 30% grade run-ups
- Final dozen miles include signature hike-a-bike
- 2.5-mile climb near route high point where "you're painfully biking or painfully walking"
- Peter Stetina: "One minute you're on nice surface and the next you're slip sliding down a scree field"

### Terrain Description (Peter Stetina)
> "The Rock Cobbler is the kookiest bike race I've ever done. It's unclassifiable. One minute you're on nice surface and the next you're slip sliding down a scree field, or just plain old riding through a field dodging cattle. There are 30 percent run ups... and it's brutally difficult."

### Bike Recommendations

**Official Guidance**:
> "This thing is designed for a cross bike with a file tread tire. A mountain bike will work. Some of us on the planning team have been stupid enough to try a road bike...don't. If you wanna try a road bike, good luck and you will suffer 1000 deaths."

**Ideal Setup**:
- Gravel bike or cyclocross bike
- Mountain bike acceptable (especially for Boulder)
- 1x drivetrain with 40T ring and 10-44T cassette for climbing
- RockShox Rudy gravel fork (40mm travel) helpful for ruts and washboard

**Tire Recommendations**:
- 38-45mm sweet spot (wider for loose/rough conditions)
- Muddy conditions: CX width (32mm) suggested by Sam Ames in wet years
- Low air pressure recommended
- Aggressive knobs with spacing for mud clearing if wet

**Shoe Choice**:
- Avoid carbon road shoes
- Need walkable shoes for hike-a-bike sections

## 4. WEATHER

### February Climate in Bakersfield

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Average High | 61-64°F (16-18°C) |
| Average Low | 40-42°F (5°C) |
| Rain Chance | 18% on average day |
| Humidity | 59-69% (highest of year) |
| Daylight Hours | 10.9 hours |
| Sunrise/Sunset | 6:43 AM / 5:36 PM |
| Average Sunshine | 6.9 hours/day |

### Race Day Considerations
- **Moderately chilly but comfortable** temperatures
- **Minimal rainfall** but February is in rainy season (Nov-March)
- **Mud risk**: When rain does occur, local dirt gets "really sticky if properly saturated"
- **2024 Example**: Pre-race rain caused mud concerns, but blue skies and "tacky trails" greeted riders
- **Rare snow**: 0.3 days snow in February, negligible accumulation
- Sweltering summers but winters cold and partly cloudy

### What to Prepare For
- Cold morning start (low 40s)
- Warming through day (low 60s)
- Possible rain/mud (pack accordingly)
- Wind exposure in foothills

## 5. FORUM INSIGHTS

### TrainerRoad Forum Highlights

**Rock Cobbler 10.0 (2023)**:
- Riding through someone's yard, through a house with donut hand-ups
- SAG/Fuel Stop at mile 49
- Last 30 gravel miles were good despite fatigue
- Hydration and fueling critical

**Rock Cobbler 11.0 (2024)**:
- Muddy conditions discussed, CX width tires recommended
- Used as Leadville practice by some riders
- Scalpel HT with 50mm Ramblers setup mentioned
- 2" wide tires suggested for mud clearance

**Rock Cobbler 2025**:
- Different start location
- Core event: 80 miles, 8,000 ft climbing
- Gravel bike with low gearing OR mountain bike recommended

### Race Report Excerpts

**First-Timer Experience** (thesportsvine.com):
> "81 miles of riding, over 8,000 ft of climbing, and some of the craziest experiences on two wheels. When they say this race is kooky, it includes riding through someone's house, hiking up muddy hills so steep you'd think you'd slip right back down, and even getting heckled by folks at a bar along the route."

**DNF Report** (tribeccato.wordpress.com):
> "I DNF'd. I was hoping for, at the best, DFL (dead f#*king last) but after 45 miles I said no more!! I knew going into it that there was a better than average chance that I would not finish. Gravel riding is not my forte and I don't have much access to it to practice."

### Community Sentiment
- "Cobbler Soup - the key ingredient is always the community"
- "Must-ride (or must-survive) for the gravel-curious and the truly unhinged alike"
- Attracts pros (Peter Stetina, Amanda Nauman, Lance Haidet) and recreational riders alike

## 6. BLACK PILL (Honest Truths)

### The Reality Check

**It's Harder Than You Think**:
> "Many endurance athletes may think '80 miles... 7000 feet of climbing... easy I got that.' What they may not realize is that the terrain is rough, the climbs are relentless, and most of this race is on some kind of dirt, grass, gravel and unroad."

**DNF Risk Is Real**:
- 4:30 PM cutoff at final SAG - miss it and you're done
- "Organizers reserve the right to haul you in"
- High self-preservation instinct = hard day ahead

**The Hike-a-Bikes**:
- Not optional, not avoidable
- "You WILL hike with your bike and pedal...a lot"
- 30% grade run-ups
- Scree fields, muddy hills, steep ranchland

**Physical Demands**:
- Tests endurance, skills, stamina, AND strategy
- Sweet spot training zone critical
- Need bike handling skills for technical sections
- Short-duration power needed for punchy climbs

**Mental Warfare**:
- "When you finish (if you finish) you will know WHY it's called the Rock Cobbler"
- Expect to "cuss at the organizers"
- Humbling for experienced cyclists

**Equipment Failures**:
- Road bikes = "suffer 1000 deaths"
- Wrong tires in mud = disaster
- Carbon road shoes = painful hike-a-bike

**Nutrition Critical**:
- 1.5-2 hours between SAG stops
- Body can only digest 30-50g carbs/hour
- Eat early and often - don't wait until hungry

### What Pros Say
- Peter Stetina: "It's brutally difficult"
- The organizers: "It's a stupidly hard RIDE"
- Amanda Nauman: "Practice shouldering your bike"

## 8. SUGGESTED GRAVEL GOD RATINGS

*Scale: 1 (easiest/least challenging) to 5 (most challenging/extreme)*

| Category | Rating | Justification |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| **Logistics** | 2/5 | Easy access from LA (2hr drive), small airport with connections, ample lodging options, on-site camping available. No international travel complexity. |
| **Length** | 4/5 | Cobbler 70-85 miles is substantial; Boulder at 115 miles is ultra-distance. Pebbler (40-50mi) offers accessible option. |
| **Technicality** | 5/5 | Mandatory hike-a-bike, 30% grades, scree fields, river crossings, livestock encounters, single track, private ranchland. Requires strong bike handling and off-bike skills. |
| **Elevation** | 4/5 | Cobbler: 8,700 ft gain / Boulder: 12,000 ft. Relentless punchy climbs, not sustained grades. "Ridiculous amount of steep climbs." |
| **Climate** | 2/5 | February = mild temps (40-64°F), low rain probability (18%), comfortable racing weather. Potential mud if rain occurs. |
| **Altitude** | 1/5 | Bakersfield sits at ~400 ft elevation, foothills top out around 2,000-3,000 ft. No altitude concerns for acclimatization. |
| **Adventure** | 5/5 | Riding through houses, cowboy bars, ball pits, bull encounters, secret ranchland, river crossings, course surprises every year. Peak adventure gravel experience. |

### Overall Assessment
The Rock Cobbler is a HIGH ADVENTURE, HIGH TECHNICALITY event with EXTREME difficulty disguised by accessible logistics. The "stupidly hard" moniker is earned. Recommended for experienced gravel cyclists with MTB skills who want a festival atmosphere with genuine suffering.
