# ROOTED VERMONT — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Heidi Bech Kjogaard [ELITE]:** "The ride was unbelievable. Everything is just so big here. We were told to come to Vermont, that it is the mecca for gravel. They were right." (https://www.state14.com/home/2019/10/7/riding-dirty-the-rise-of-gravel-riding-in-vermont)

**Ted King [ELITE]:** "Honestly, I thought my career as a professional cyclist was over. [But] Gravel has taken me places I never thought I'd go and introduced me to a whole other side of cycling that I am grateful for." (https://www.state14.com/home/2019/10/7/riding-dirty-the-rise-of-gravel-riding-in-vermont)

**Ted King [ELITE]:** "Gravel is so welcoming to everyone. If you're not up front competing for the win, you quickly find your tribe in the race. Everyone is pushing themselves to their limits whatever that might be and celebrating afterward together with an IPA — how cool is that?" (https://www.state14.com/home/2019/10/7/riding-dirty-the-rise-of-gravel-riding-in-vermont)

**Anurag Saxena [ELITE]:** "The whole weekend was like gravel summer camp and I left wanting more. I cannot wait for the lottery to open and hopefully I can get in for 2022. I hope to ride the 80 mile route next year." (https://www.ohiogravelgrinders.com/blog/2021/8/15/recap-rooted-vermont-2021)

**Larry (Senior Ripper blogger) [UNKNOWN]:** "This race took place in a part of Vermont very near to where my mom retired. My mom passed away 20 years ago last month...When I signed up for this race, I didn't really think about being back to my mom's old haunts. But when we got there, emotions flowed like a rushing creek." (https://seniorripper.com/rooted-vermont/)

**Larry (Senior Ripper) [UNKNOWN]:** "Part way up the climb, I connected with Katrina, who rode at a similar pace as I, so we decided to stick together, and frankly, she deserves a lot of credit for pulling me through...We chatted the entire rest of the ride, which proved a valuable distraction, and before we knew it, we were headed for home, a full hour ahead of my target time." (https://seniorripper.com/rooted-vermont/)

**Wiehan (Mountain Road blogger) [COMPETITIVE]:** "Days like these are the ultimate for a cyclist! The big focus that Rooted Vermont places on the 'party in the back' links in perfectly with how I felt on the day – it really is all about getting out on your bike and having a good time." (https://mountain-road.com/blog/gravelride-rooted-vermont)

**jwellford (TrainerRoad forum) [COMPETITIVE]:** "Rooted was today: what an amazing event! I'd highly recommend it to any of you northeast gravel racers/riders. Incredibly well-organized, huge number of volunteers, fun 'mullet protocol' that cares as much about the back of the pack as the pros in the front, and we were treated to a beautiful Vermont morning with only a bit of rain several hours in." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/rooted-vermont-anyone/61531)

**Laura King (co-race director) [ELITE]:** "We realized that a lot of women were either riding alone, or just with their partners, and that maybe by hosting a women's clinic, we could help them find other women to ride with to make their experience on a bike even better." (https://www.singletracks.com/community/rooted-vermont-gravel-race-laura-ted-king/)

**Kristin Motley (co-race director) [ELITE]:** "We talk about this a lot with the brands we work with — that we're here to make friends. So be nice! Sit with people. Make eye contact. Say hello. Start a conversation. This is about so much more than a start line." (https://www.singletracks.com/community/rooted-vermont-gravel-race-laura-ted-king/)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**jwellford [COMPETITIVE]:** "I used my Crux with GravelKing 38 slicks. I had a wide gear range with 42 chainring and 9-46 cassette. 2x would work well too." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/rooted-vermont-anyone/61531)

**Ted King [ELITE]:** "The vast majority is on this fast gravel, so if you were a really adept racer you might just get by on a road bike with really wide tyres – 34 slicks might be ok. Most people, myself included, would probably choose a gravel bike with 35-40 tyres. It's a toss-up between slicks and knobbies but it goes back to your skill on the bike. Otherwise, a pretty wide gear range because the hills are relatively short and steep." (https://www.cyclingnews.com/features/rooted-vermont-returns-mullets-hatchets-and-endless-gravel/)

**Note on tire choice:** Elite riders with strong technical skills can run 34mm slicks on road bikes; most riders opt for 35-40mm gravel tires. The choice between slicks and knobbies depends heavily on skill level and conditions.

**Gear range:** Multiple sources emphasize the need for wide-range gearing due to "relatively short and steep" hills throughout the course.

## Weather Experienced

**2021 Race Day (August 1):** "Race day, Sunday August 1 was cloudy. Rain was in the forecast but that did not keep anyone from coming out...The route traversed through the beautiful countryside of Vermont. I couldn't get enough of it...The beautiful scenery gave into rain 10 miles in. By the first rest stop, I was drenched and standing under the rest stop tent was a relief from the rain...As the route turned towards the Start/Finish, the rain stopped and I dried off on the bike...It started to rain again after I finished. I was glad to finish before it started raining again. There were fire pits to warm up. Never did I think that I would be cold and standing by a fire pit in August but as someone said to me, 'It's New England, get used to it!'" (https://www.ohiogravelgrinders.com/blog/2021/8/15/recap-rooted-vermont-2021)

**2021 Race Day:** "Race day on Sunday, the weather looked iffy, at best. It was mid-50's, and cloudy, and rain was in the forecast, but not until 2 that afternoon." Start was "cool, dry and festive." (https://seniorripper.com/rooted-vermont/)

**Pre-race conditions (2019):** "picture-perfect blue skies" during the race, with "late-summer air" (https://www.state14.com/home/2019/10/7/riding-dirty-the-rise-of-gravel-riding-in-vermont)

**Wiehan's DIY ride (August 2020):** "The weather played perfectly into my favor on the day and the fresh cool air that followed tropical storm Isaias really added to the enjoyment" (https://mountain-road.com/blog/gravelride-rooted-vermont)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Course description from State14 article:** "starts at Cochran Ski Area in Richmond, winds through the Green Mountain National Forest in Ripton and Lincoln, and drops back down to the ski area on a combination of paved, dirt, and muddy rock- and puddle-strewn class 4 logging roads." (https://www.state14.com/home/2019/10/7/riding-dirty-the-rise-of-gravel-riding-in-vermont)

**Class IV roads:** jwellford describes "the difficult class IV (pavé) section" with a photo showing very rough, rocky terrain. (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/rooted-vermont-anyone/61531)

**Hill profile:** "Roads undulate, surfaces change" - "It's hilly. There's no big extended climb but it's just non-stop up and down." (https://www.cyclingnews.com/features/rooted-vermont-returns-mullets-hatchets-and-endless-gravel/)

**Opening climb:** "The ride started with a serious climb, around 2 miles from the start" (https://seniorripper.com/rooted-vermont/)

**Finish:** "The finish was uphill on a Class 4 Jeep road followed by a looping single track." (https://www.ohiogravelgrinders.com/blog/2021/8/15/recap-rooted-vermont-2021)

**Vermont terrain character:** "Vermont is particularly suited for gravel events, having more unpaved roads than paved. Directions in Vermont often contain the phrase 'when the pavement ends.'" (https://www.state14.com/home/2019/10/7/riding-dirty-the-rise-of-gravel-riding-in-vermont)

**Scenery highlights:** Anurag notes "Where do you get to see Alpacas' on a bike race?!" and multiple riders emphasized barn sightings as quintessentially Vermont. (https://www.ohiogravelgrinders.com/blog/2021/8/15/recap-rooted-vermont-2021)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Larry's pacing approach [UNKNOWN level]:** "I anticipated having to stop at several aid stations for refueling and nature breaks. That means I had to average roughly 10 miles per hour to be safe. Ordinarily, that would be a breeze on pavement. But this race was largely on dirt roads and some single track, with lots of climbs, so for me, I thought 10 mph was a realistic target." He finished the 48-mile Little Sip course "a full hour ahead of my target time." (https://seniorripper.com/rooted-vermont/)

**Aid station strategy:** Larry asked about water bottle capacity: "Do you know how many rest stops there are? I'm hoping to refill frequently to avoid having to carry a ton." Response showed 4 aid stations on the course, allowing strategy of "carrying two bottles. And hey, it's not a race (for me). If I need to sit at a stop and down an extra bottle, so be it." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/rooted-vermont-anyone/61531)

**FrankTuna's heat prep [COMPETITIVE]:** "I'm in western MA about 3 hours from Richmond, VT. It's going to be in the upper 90s this weekend. Let's hope it cools off for the ride. I have mounts on my fork…thinking of bringing 4 water bottles and a gallon of sunscreen." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/rooted-vermont-anyone/61531)

**Finding your pace group:** "If you're not up front competing for the win, you quickly find your tribe in the race" - riders naturally group by pace. (https://www.state14.com/home/2019/10/7/riding-dirty-the-rise-of-gravel-riding-in-vermont)

**Aid stations:** Aid stations feature "everything from encouragement to Untapped Maple gels to grilled Twinkies to directions." (https://www.state14.com/home/2019/10/7/riding-dirty-the-rise-of-gravel-riding-in-vermont)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**"Mullet Protocol" philosophy:** The event embraces "business in the front, party in the back" - competitive racing up front while celebrating the experience throughout the field. (https://www.singletracks.com/community/rooted-vermont-gravel-race-laura-ted-king/)

**Last finisher celebration:** "And just as in 2019, when the last rider was ushered through the finish chute with cheering, fanfare, and plenty of high-fives, the 2021 crowd offered the final racer a similarly festive finish." (https://www.singletracks.com/community/rooted-vermont-gravel-race-laura-ted-king/)

**Post-race atmosphere:** "Unlike traditional road racing events where after the race, riders quickly decamp home, at gravel everyone gathers afterward to share in local food and craft beer, whether professional or amateur rider." (https://www.state14.com/home/2019/10/7/riding-dirty-the-rise-of-gravel-riding-in-vermont)

**Welcome party:** Friday night featured "delicious tacos and complimentary beer, courtesy of one of the event sponsors, Lawson's Finest. There were lots of dirty legs." (https://seniorripper.com/rooted-vermont/)

**Women's clinic impact:** 50 women attended the first clinic in 2019; by 2021, 100 women participated with 240+ applications. "We don't actually care if the women who came to the clinic register for Rooted. We care about getting more women on bikes." (https://www.singletracks.com/community/rooted-vermont-gravel-race-laura-ted-king/)

**Expo day:** Saturday features "an expo day with all our sponsors, some shake-out rides, and pro panels, including a specific women's forum." (https://www.cyclingnews.com/features/rooted-vermont-returns-mullets-hatchets-and-endless-gravel/)

**Community building focus:** "Whether the women who attended the clinic crossed in the lead group or didn't sign up at all, I hope they come away feeling like they're part of something bigger than themselves, and that once they're part of the community, they can show up to any gravel race and know someone or have new friends to ride with." (https://www.singletracks.com/community/rooted-vermont-gravel-race-laura-ted-king/)

**Vermont hospitality:** "It was really crazy but at every turn, people were there for us in the local community and beyond...In planning the event, the Kings relied heavily on the advice of other gravel event promoters in Vermont who happily pitched in to help." (https://www.state14.com/home/2019/10/7/riding-dirty-the-rise-of-gravel-riding-in-vermont)

**Prizes:** Instead of cash, winners receive "beautiful wooden hatchets" crafted by a local Vermont artisan, plus "bottles of maple syrup from our town." (https://www.cyclingnews.com/features/rooted-vermont-returns-mullets-hatchets-and-endless-gravel/)

**Vermont creemees:** Multiple riders specifically mention Maple Creemees (soft-serve ice cream made with local maple syrup) as a highlight: "I'm not a soft serve kind of guy, but somehow, these were richer, tastier and far more decadent than your typical DQ scoop. I was hooked!" (https://seniorripper.com/rooted-vermont/)
