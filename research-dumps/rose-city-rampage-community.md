# ROSE CITY RAMPAGE GRAVEL RACE — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Race Cancellation & Context

**Event Cancellation (2025):** The Rose City Rampage was cancelled by Chainbuster Racing due to low registration numbers. According to Jason from Chainbuster Racing **[COMPETITIVE - race promoter perspective]**: "We made the decision to cancel Rose City Rampage because we had 18 registrants. We understand why. That particular event is far from our typical participation base, and we were the third event in the same area in a three-month period. Market saturation is also a battle that we fight."

**Industry Context:** The cancellation reflects broader challenges in the grassroots racing scene. Jason notes: "The cost of putting on an event is at an all-time high while registration numbers are at an all-time low... No one that we know is getting rich or retiring off race revenue."

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Grassroots Racing Philosophy:** From Jason at Chainbuster Racing **[COMPETITIVE - promoter perspective]**: "It starts with lining up against your buddies, talking smack that you may or may not be able to back up, and letting the joy of community and camaraderie rule the day. The hug or fist bump at the end means more than any medal ever could." (https://sadlebred.com/page/7/)

**Warning on Event Sustainability:** The promoter emphasized the fragility of local racing: "However, if we as a collective cycling community don't fight to save the local racing scene, the opportunity for that experience will fade away, and all that will remain will be expensive, impersonal corporate experiences."
