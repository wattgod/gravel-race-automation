# ROSE CITY RAMPAGE GRAVEL RACE — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Race Cancellation & Context

**Event Cancellation (2025):** The Rose City Rampage was cancelled by Chainbuster Racing due to low registration numbers. According to Jason from Chainbuster Racing **[COMPETITIVE - race promoter perspective]**: "We made the decision to cancel Rose City Rampage because we had 18 registrants. We understand why. That particular event is far from our typical participation base, and we were the third event in the same area in a three-month period. Market saturation is also a battle that we fight." (https://sadlebred.com/page/7/)

**Industry Context:** The cancellation reflects broader challenges in the grassroots racing scene. Jason notes: "The cost of putting on an event is at an all-time high while registration numbers are at an all-time low... No one that we know is getting rich or retiring off race revenue."

**Event History:** The Rose City Rampage has been held previously, with at least one edition taking place on December 2, 2023. The event is part of the **Small Town Gravel Series** organized by **Chainbuster Racing** (chainbusterracing.com). The 2025 edition was planned for Saturday, March 22, in Thomasville, Georgia, before being cancelled. Registration was available through BikeReg but was marked as cancelled. (bikereg.com)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Location:** The race is based in Thomasville, Georgia, in the southwestern corner of the state. Thomasville sits at approximately 200 feet above sea level in the coastal plain region. The course covers approximately 55 miles with an estimated 2,000 feet of elevation gain, suggesting gently rolling terrain typical of south Georgia's red clay and pine forest landscape.

**Surface Character:** No detailed surface breakdown has been published. South Georgia gravel roads are typically composed of packed red clay and crushed limestone, which can become sticky and challenging when wet. The relatively low elevation gain over 55 miles indicates a course without major climbs but with steady rolling terrain.

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

No participant-specific equipment recommendations are available from race reports. South Georgia red clay gravel surfaces are well-suited to standard gravel bike setups. Riders should be aware that wet conditions can make red clay extremely adhesive, potentially clogging drivetrains and brakes — disc brakes with adequate clearance are recommended.

## Weather Experienced

**March Conditions in Thomasville, GA:** Late March in Thomasville typically features mild to warm temperatures, with daytime highs in the mid-60s to low 70s Fahrenheit. Spring rain is possible, and the combination of rain with south Georgia's red clay can create challenging mud conditions. No specific race-day weather reports are available from past editions.

## Race Strategy & Pacing

No pacing data or strategy reports are available from participants. The 55-mile distance with 2,000 feet of elevation gain suggests a moderately paced event that rewards steady effort over the gently rolling terrain. The course profile does not feature the extended climbs or technical descents that create natural selection points at more mountainous events.

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Grassroots Racing Philosophy:** From Jason at Chainbuster Racing: "It starts with lining up against your buddies, talking smack that you may or may not be able to back up, and letting the joy of community and camaraderie rule the day. The hug or fist bump at the end means more than any medal ever could." (https://sadlebred.com/page/7/)

**Warning on Event Sustainability:** The promoter emphasized the fragility of local racing: "However, if we as a collective cycling community don't fight to save the local racing scene, the opportunity for that experience will fade away, and all that will remain will be expensive, impersonal corporate experiences."

**Small Town Gravel Series:** Rose City Rampage is part of Chainbuster Racing's Small Town Gravel Series, which focuses on bringing gravel events to smaller communities. The series emphasizes accessibility and community connection over large-scale production. (chainbusterracing.com)

**Market Challenges:** The 2025 cancellation with only 18 registrants highlights the challenges facing local gravel events, particularly when multiple events compete for the same regional participant base within a short timeframe. The promoter's candid assessment provides insight into the economics of grassroots race promotion. (sadlebred.com)
