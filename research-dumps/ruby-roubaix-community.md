# RUBY ROUBAIX — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Event Overview & Unique Characteristics

Ruby Roubaix is a **Gravel Fondo** (race it or ride it — participant's choice) held annually in late June near Lamoille, Nevada, at the base of the Ruby Mountains. The event offers four distance options: 22-mile, 38-mile, 62-mile, and 120.5-mile routes on mixed gravel and pavement. E-bikes (Class 1 and 3, pedal-assist only) are allowed but not competitive for timing/awards.

**Format**: Fondo-style means participants can choose to race competitively against the clock or ride at their own pace. The event is organized by the Rotary Club of Elko Desert Sunrise as a fundraiser for youth leadership programs and community improvement projects.

**Community motto**: The event emphasizes small-town hospitality in "wild, beautiful Nevada" with spectacular scenery and lightly traveled roads.

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Bike Choice [UNKNOWN LEVEL — from event organizers]:**
- "The best bike for this event will be a dedicated cyclocross or gravel bike with disc brakes, clearance for up to 45-50mm tires"
- "A low-profile tubeless tire will roll the fastest"
- **Minimum tire width**: "Anything less than a 35mm tire will result in a lot of bad words and a very long day"
- **Organizer experience**: "Those familiar with the course have ridden most of the gravel described in the event on UCI-legal 32mm cyclocross tires, and it did result in multiple pinch flats, a couple of dented rims, and a rather harsh ride"
- **Recommended setup**: "We have found that a 38mm tubeless setup is faster and easier on the hands and tush"
- **Alternative**: "A hard tail or even rigid cross country mountain bike with ~1.5 – 1.9″ tires, low profile tread pattern will work well"

**Critical warning**: "Don't bring newly mounted tubeless tires that you haven't put a few rides on to ensure that sealant is distributed and working"

**Required gear to carry:**
- Tire repair (pump, CO2 cartridges and inflator, tubes "even with tubeless--yes, I've needed a tube to make it home with tubeless that wouldn't seal", patch kit, tire levers)
- Multi-tool with appropriate allen wrenches, chain tool, chain quick-links
- Front and rear blinky lights "even though these are lightly traveled roads, the extra visibility provided by a good light is a great enhancement to rider safety"
- 2 water bottles and/or hydration pack
- Rain shell ("not likely but possible")
- "Madonna di Ghisallo prayer card" (humorous addition)

**E-bike considerations [UNKNOWN LEVEL]:** "E-bike riders will need to be diligent with power management in order to complete the Secret Pass and Ruby loops under electric assist modes"

**Aero bars**: Not allowed

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Gravel vs. Pavement breakdown:**
- Ruby Loop (120.5 miles): 60 miles gravel, 57 miles pavement
- Secret Pass Loop (62 miles): 41 miles gravel, 21 miles pavement
- Lee Loop (38 miles): 28 miles gravel, 8 miles pavement
- Pleasant Valley Loop (22 miles): 12 miles gravel, 8 miles pavement

**Road surface conditions [UNKNOWN LEVEL — from event organizers]:**
"Everything from lightly traveled, well maintained paved highway, well compacted dirt, washboards, loose sand-gravel, some areas of well compacted rocky road. There are several significant segments with energy-sucking loose sand-gravel. Corners will likely have choppy washboards on the inside line to loose gravel on the outside line."

**Water crossings**: "There may be a couple of water crossings on the segment from Pleasant Valley Road to Lee, and it's possible that some sections between Secret Pass highway and Lamoille to have water crossings depending on winter snowpack and spring storms"

**Most challenging section — Harrison Pass descent (117-mile Ruby Loop):**
"The east side of Harrison Pass (117 mile Ruby Loop) has the steepest downhill grades (up to 10%) on a twisting gravel road with choppy washboards and loose gravel"

**Course characteristics**: The routes pass through Lee, Jiggs, Ruby Lake National Wildlife Refuge, and Ruby Valley, with significant climbing on the Secret Pass and Ruby Loop routes.

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Time estimates [UNKNOWN LEVEL — from event organizers]:**
- Lee Loop (36-38 miles): 2-3 hours for "skilled, fit riders"
- Secret Pass Loop (62 miles): 4-6 hours
- Ruby Loop (117-120.5 miles): 8-12 hours
- Pleasant Valley Loop (20-22 miles): "under 2 hours" for fit riders, "2.5 to 3 hours" for newbie/novice riders

**Elite-level reference [UNKNOWN LEVEL]:** "A couple of local riders completed the long course in just over 8 hours moving time while training for the Nevada State 508 (which they won in the 2-person category)"

**Cutoff times:**
- Ruby Loop: Maximum 12 hours total
- **Critical cutoff** — Harrison Pass summit: approximately 11:00 am (this is a "point of no return" as "once you descend the east side of the pass the 'easiest' way out is to finish the loop")
- Secret Pass Loop: 8 hours maximum
- Lee Loop: 4 hours or less
- Pleasant Valley Loop: 2.5-3 hours depending on experience
- Lee School intermediate rest stop (10 miles): 2 hours from start

**Safety requirement**: "All riders must check in at the rest stops – we'll make it easy. We just don't want to lose anyone in wild Nevada"

**Nutrition support**: Aid stations at approximately 12-18 mile intervals with "water, electrolytes, Hammer Nutrition products, salty/sweet snacks, fruit, portable toilet and hand washing facilities, minor mechanical support"

**Included in entry**: Hammer Nutrition Goody Bag with gel pouch, Endurolytes Fizz in 2 flavors

## DNF Risk Factors

**Mechanical issues from terrain:**
- Pinch flats from running tires too narrow (documented with 32mm tires)
- Dented rims from insufficient tire volume
- Tubeless sealant failures requiring tube backups

**Course point of no return**: Harrison Pass summit — once descended, finishing the loop is easier than retreating

**E-bike specific**: Power management critical for Secret Pass and Ruby loops

**Environmental**: Potential for snow even in late June, though rare

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Event philosophy**: "Fondo style so you can race it or ride it--you pick. Routes range from mild to the wild so you choose your level of challenge as well"

**Volunteer support [from local newspaper coverage]:** "Community volunteers will greet you at stops along the routes with big smiles, two-way radios, water, and snacks specific to the needs of cyclists performing over long distances in the sun and dust"

**Post-race amenities:**
- Las Brisas taco truck serving 11am-2pm
- Each rider receives lunch and beverage (non-alcoholic and microbrews) with entry
- Pre-order option for longer distance riders finishing after 2pm
- O'Carroll's Bar and Grill nearby serving sandwiches, burgers, and beer
- Massages from Lamoille Movement Experiences (noted in 2024 photos)
- Bell-ringing volunteer at finish line

**Community impact**: Event proceeds support "youth leadership development, exchange programs, local and global community improvement projects, and programs that encourage healthy behaviors and inspirational service to others." Funding has supported RYLA scholarships for Elko County high school students, college scholarships, and community improvement projects in Lamoille, Spring Creek, and Elko.

**Marketing support**: Elko Convention and Visitor's Authority (ECVA) and Travel Nevada awarded marketing grants to promote the event and "draw them off I-80 to experience the breathtaking beauty of the Ruby Mountains from a bicycle seat"

**Economic impact**: "Most out-of-town athletes arrive the day before the race and stay an extra day afterward to enjoy the local cuisine, diverse culture, rich history, outdoor activities, striking scenery"

**Registration trends**: As of Monday before the 2023 event, 165 cyclists had signed up (higher numbers than previous year according to organizer Kerry Aguirre)
