This research dump can only include information from the single relevant source.

## Race Overview & Concept

**Andy Chasteen [COMPETITIVE] (race founder):** The Rule of Three concept emerged while testing Allied's Able gravel bike in Bentonville's backyard. "We were riding singletrack on these prototype Able's, testing, stopping every 10 minutes, talking about what we liked and didn't... we came up with a crazy idea – on this bike we could ride singletrack, gravel, and road all day long. Somehow we came up with a name – Rule of Three — and it stuck." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/road/road-culture/three-reasons-why-the-rule-of-three-is-not-your-typical-gravel-race/)

The event's defining characteristic is its multi-surface format requiring riders to navigate three distinct terrain types in a single course.

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Course breakdown from race founder Andy Chasteen [COMPETITIVE]:**
- 30 miles of rolling, hilly pavement
- 50 miles of gravel
- 20 miles of singletrack

**On the singletrack sections:** "The singletrack is not easy. It's not super techy, it's pretty smooth, fast, and flowy, but very climby. You find a lot of the singletrack on the course is the kind that you ride and you're done with the ride and your mouth hurts because you've been smiling the whole time."

**Venue specifics:** The race begins and ends at Coler Mountain Bike Preserve, approximately one mile west of downtown Bentonville. The preserve features "flowy jump lines and techy rock sections." Race organizers considered "finishing on the dual slalom course." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/road/road-culture/three-reasons-why-the-rule-of-three-is-not-your-typical-gravel-race/)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Andy Chasteen [COMPETITIVE] on equipment strategy:** "A hardtail rigid mountain bike on 2.0 tires might win this. Or an Able with 650b wheels and 50mm tires. There's gonna be a lot of strategy involved, especially with equipment choices, which is a cool thing. The rock is sharp, too, so you're gonna have to run durable tires or you're gonna slash a sidewall." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/road/road-culture/three-reasons-why-the-rule-of-three-is-not-your-typical-gravel-race/)

**Key takeaway [UNKNOWN LEVEL applicability]:** Tire durability is critical due to sharp rock. Equipment choice involves significant tradeoffs between speed on pavement/gravel versus capability on singletrack.

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Race philosophy from founder Andy Chasteen [COMPETITIVE]:** The event draws inspiration from the 24 Hours of Horseshoe Hell climbing festival, which Chasteen has run for 15 years. "It's very Burning Man-esque with costumes and quirky weirdness, and I wanted to play off of that." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/road/road-culture/three-reasons-why-the-rule-of-three-is-not-your-typical-gravel-race/)

**Quirky categories mentioned:**
- 30+ pound bike category (suggested by Colin Strickland)
- "Most selfies with roadkill" category with prizes like "a set of Enve wheels"
- Team format option (teams of three, leaving in time trial intervals, must stay together at checkpoints)

**Event design philosophy:** "This event will never be about making a living, it will always about making a cool event." Entry fees kept low at $60-65. Sponsors don't provide cash but instead "come and do something that creates value for the people at the event" such as hosting after-parties or serving Moscow Mules. (https://velo.outsideonline.com/road/road-culture/three-reasons-why-the-rule-of-three-is-not-your-typical-gravel-race/)

**Participant decision-making approach:** When deciding whether to hold the 2020 edition during COVID, Chasteen put it to a vote on the private Facebook page. "80/20 were in favor of canceling, so we canceled. We refunded or deferred all fees. That, in my opinion, creates buy-in for people who come to your event. That's playing the long game." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/road/road-culture/three-reasons-why-the-rule-of-three-is-not-your-typical-gravel-race/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Team racing option:** Teams of three depart in 1-2 minute intervals after solo racers, time trial style. Teams must stay together and check in at designated checkpoints. Chasteen notes this lowers barriers: "My first year of bike riding I was too intimidated to do a 100-mile event by myself but if I could get friends together — it creates a lower barrier of intimidation."
