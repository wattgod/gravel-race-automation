# RUST BUSTER GRAVEL FONDO — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Padraig [UNKNOWN]:** "I did my first organized event of the season at the beginning of April while I was in Memphis for the eclipse with my boys. The event was put on by my friend Clark at Victory Bicycle Studio in midtown Memphis... I like Clark because he's actively building community in Memphis. Friends of mine who aren't even cyclists have dusted off their beach cruisers and signed up for his training groups and now I have people asking me what sort of road bike to buy." (https://cyclingindependent.com/the-rust-bucket-gravel-ride/)

**Padraig [UNKNOWN]:** "What was funny to me was that the opening 20-ish miles had next to no gravel to speak of and I wondered why I wasn't just running the 30mm Panaracers I'd been riding days before. Oh ye of little faith. After commenting to a rider next to me, roughly a mile later the road went to gravel and mostly stayed gravel for the next 25 mi." (https://cyclingindependent.com/the-rust-bucket-gravel-ride/)

**Padraig [UNKNOWN]:** "I met a number of really nice riders, who, like me, worried that the end of the ride would take us back over all the hills in Shelby Forest, a fate we were saved from, though the 45-mile route ended up being more like 52 mi." (https://cyclingindependent.com/the-rust-bucket-gravel-ride/)

**Nicholas Garbis [UNKNOWN]:** "With my 2024 cyclocross season winding down, I had a 'rust-buster' race on my mind to kick off the year. I decided to revisit The Dirty South Roubaix" (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/category/race-reports/)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Padraig [UNKNOWN]:** Mounted American Classic Kimber Lite tires (40-42mm width, fairly slick profile) based on organizer recommendation. Notes: "Prior to flying out, I texted Clark and asked him what tire I should mount and he said something fairly slick, but 40-42mm wide, so I mounted up the American Classic Kimber Lite, which I reviewed last year." The wider, slicker tire proved appropriate for the mixed surface conditions encountered. (https://cyclingindependent.com/the-rust-bucket-gravel-ride/)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Padraig [UNKNOWN]:** "This is land I know from years ago when I still lived and trained in Memphis. It's west of the westernmost highway in Tennessee, which is to say all the roads are small. And while Western Tennessee is mostly flat to slightly rolling, the river bluff land in and around Meeman-Shelby Forest State Park is very hilly. None of the hills are particularly big, but they often turn quite steep, so it is possible to encounter a 100-meter-long hill that tilts at 13 percent." (https://cyclingindependent.com/the-rust-bucket-gravel-ride/)

**Padraig [UNKNOWN]:** "This area, sometimes in sight of the Mississippi River is an area I'd never visited at all before. It's mostly flat farmland. While this isn't Mississippi, this is William Faulkner's South, a place of tilled fields, spring floods and oppressive summers. The gravel road usually had some loose pea gravel on it, but there was almost always two good lines, but even the soft stuff was rideable; it was just a little slower." (https://cyclingindependent.com/the-rust-bucket-gravel-ride/)

**Course routing note:** The opening ~20 miles are primarily paved/minimal gravel, followed by ~25 miles that are predominantly gravel. Advertised 45-mile route actually measured closer to 52 miles. (https://cyclingindependent.com/the-rust-bucket-gravel-ride/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Distance consideration [UNKNOWN rider perspective]:** "I think the 50-ish mile length of the Rust Buster is a really terrific distance for a gravel event. I got out, I saw stuff, had a great ride, met cool people—including some readers/listeners—pulverized my legs sufficiently, AND! I got home at a reasonable hour, which means that doing an organized event while on vacation with my family didn't become a day-long ordeal of me being gone with the only car. Burning a whole day is something family members tend not to be too wild about, so being able to leave before anyone missed me and be home just after 2:00 gave me time to do something with my family, so they didn't feel cheated."

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Event organization:** "At the finish there were lamb tacos, chicken wings, a local IPA and small servings of key lime pie." Post-race included expo with sponsors and after-party at Purlieu. (https://cyclingindependent.com/the-rust-bucket-gravel-ride/)

**Community building impact:** Clark Butcher (organizer) is "actively building community in Memphis. Friends of mine who aren't even cyclists have dusted off their beach cruisers and signed up for his training groups." Event attracts riders from multiple states including Arkansas, Georgia, North Carolina, and Mississippi. (https://cyclingindependent.com/the-rust-bucket-gravel-ride/)

**Event philosophy:** "We've taken the concept of a traditional bike race and turned it on its head. You won't get a ride like this anywhere else... No fig newton and warm Gatorade snack stations here. We've got vendors coming in from all over to offer some of the best food you've seen at a race. Down to the 2-ply toilet paper, you'll experience hospitality at its finest." (https://victorybicyclestudio.com/2024-rust-buster-ride/)

**Competitive elements:** Each course has a Strava segment with awards going to KOM and QOM of the day. Event supported by major brands including SRAM, Pinarello, Scott Bicycles, Giordana Apparel, Moots, Shimano, and others. (https://victorybicyclestudio.com/2024-rust-buster-ride/)

**Ride leaders:** Local Memphis Porsche club leads the road ride; 901 motocross club leads the gravel ride. 2025 edition added a Women's Warm-Up Ride and E-Bike Afternoon Ride. (https://k9jnfb-vq.myshopify.com/pages/rust-buster-ride)
