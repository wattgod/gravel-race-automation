# SAFARI GRAVEL RACE — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Maddy Nutt [ELITE]:** "Without a doubt the toughest course I've raced, with miles of leg-sapping deep sand and slippy and rough descents!" (https://www.ribblecycles.co.uk/blog/maddy-nutt-reigns-victorious-at-safari-gravel/)

**Maddy Nutt [ELITE]:** "The race itself was super-tough. Mainly because of the course profile, which was super-sandy and technical, but also because of the extreme heat. I crashed early in the race on a deep sand section but quickly got back on and switched my head back into racing mode. Entering the second half of the race, I knew there was a 6km climb that I could take advantage of, and I pushed on up the climb, gapping myself from the rest of the women behind. With 12.5km left, my legs started cramping (both calves, one foot and quad!). I honestly didn't think I'd be able to make it to the finish, but luckily, the rest of the route was almost entirely downhill, and I was able to maintain speed and freewheel to the line." (https://www.ribblecycles.co.uk/blog/maddy-nutt-reigns-victorious-at-safari-gravel/)

**James Savage (Race Director) [UNKNOWN]:** "We wanted to cater to all levels of riders, so we've designed a course with three loops. The first, a 20km loop, offers a taste of racing for newcomers. The second, a 40km loop, is the final round for men over 60 and women over 50. And finally, a challenging 60km loop that will push even the elite riders to their limits. Starting and ending at the Flamingo Farm near Elsa's Gate, each loop showcases the natural beauty of the park." (https://ucigravelworldseries.com/en/safari-gravel-race-kenyas-inaugural-uci-event/)

**James Savage (Race Director) [UNKNOWN]:** "The course isn't just about the rocks and gravel; it's about sharing the terrain with Kenya's diverse wildlife. From giraffes to zebras, ostriches to wildebeests, riders will encounter a truly unforgettable spectacle of nature." (https://ucigravelworldseries.com/en/safari-gravel-race-kenyas-inaugural-uci-event/)

**James Savage (Race Director) [UNKNOWN]:** "Despite the picturesque surroundings, this race will be no walk in the park. With 1800m of elevation gain and a predominantly gravel terrain, participants will need to bring their best legs." (https://ucigravelworldseries.com/en/safari-gravel-race-kenyas-inaugural-uci-event/)

**Sami Sauri [UNKNOWN]:** "This is the wildest race in the world right now... My biggest attraction to Migration was that Kenya would be an incredible place to race. As much as I've travelled all over the world I've never been to Africa. That was really big for me. In the end, it was pretty epic." (https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/rouleur-explore/explore-the-wildest-race)

**Sami Sauri [UNKNOWN]:** "It was like being in a zoo in reality, with all these animals crossing in front of you while you're racing. For me, it was mind blowing." (https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/rouleur-explore/explore-the-wildest-race)

**Britta Berube [RECREATIONAL]:** "I caught up to a new friend, who I'd met the night before... We talked about many of his adventures and how excited he was about riding this route in the summer, as he had only fat biked it in the winter among groomed snowmobile trails for the Fat Pursuit race. It was familiar terrain, but he was utterly surprised by the surface—a fun mix of everything and very little of what 'gravel' seems to mean these days. The route took us on mostly forest service roads that were loose, rocky, sandy, and rutted out in some areas. There was about a mile of riding through a swamp, 4 miles of singletrack on the continental divide, and a punchy hike-a-bike section that sat just below the high point, Mount Two Top."

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**[ELITE] Cramping Management:** Maddy Nutt experienced severe cramping (both calves, one foot, quad) with 12.5km remaining but was able to finish by taking advantage of the predominantly downhill finish, freewheeling to maintain speed while allowing muscles to recover (https://www.ribblecycles.co.uk/blog/maddy-nutt-reigns-victorious-at-safari-gravel/)

**[ELITE] Key Selection Point:** The 6km climb in the second half is where strong climbers can create decisive gaps. Maddy Nutt used this climb to break away from competitors and establish her winning margin (https://www.ribblecycles.co.uk/blog/maddy-nutt-reigns-victorious-at-safari-gravel/)

**[RECREATIONAL] Mindset Advice:** Britta Berube struggled with heavy legs early and questioned her ability to finish. Her riding companion told her "we have all day" which helped her shift from competitive pressure to enjoyment, ultimately completing the ride in 6.5 hours—"the longest I had ever been on a bike" (https://sacredrides.com/my-first-gravel-bike-race/)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Deep Sand Crashes:** Multiple riders crashed on deep sand sections. Maddy Nutt [ELITE] crashed early but recovered quickly. The sandy technical sections pose significant crash risk throughout the course (https://www.ribblecycles.co.uk/blog/maddy-nutt-reigns-victorious-at-safari-gravel/)

**Extreme Heat & Cramping:** The extreme heat conditions contribute to severe cramping issues, even for elite riders. Maddy Nutt experienced full-body cramping (calves, foot, quad) in the closing kilometers (https://www.ribblecycles.co.uk/blog/maddy-nutt-reigns-victorious-at-safari-gravel/)

**Mechanical Issues:** Sami Sauri experienced mechanical problems during Safari Gravel that prevented her from finishing, though specific details weren't provided (https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/rouleur-explore/explore-the-wildest-race)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Post-Race Scene:** "It's shaping up to be a showdown of epic proportions" with a finisher's party at Carnelley's venue featuring "incredible vibes" (https://ucigravelworldseries.com/en/safari-gravel-race-kenyas-inaugural-uci-event/ and https://www.teamamani.com/safari-gravel-race)

**Historic Significance:** Kenya's first-ever UCI gravel event. Race organizer Mikel Delagrange: "This isn't just another race; it's a historic moment for Kenya, and we couldn't be prouder" (https://ucigravelworldseries.com/en/safari-gravel-race-kenyas-inaugural-uci-event/)

**Wildlife Experience:** The race takes place in the same location that inspired Disney's Lion King (Pride Rock in Hell's Gate National Park). Riders describe having to stop racing to let elephants pass, with zebras and wildebeests regularly crossing the course (https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/rouleur-explore/explore-the-wildest-race)

**Women's Community Building:** Sami Sauri organized a pre-race women's gravel social ride in Nairobi through 'The W Collective,' bringing together international and 15 Kenyan women: "For me, there wasn't really a women's scene when I started racing, so I'm passionate about opening the door for others to know they have people to ride with wherever they are." All bikes were accepted, and riders shared experiences over coffee afterward (https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/rouleur-explore/explore-the-wildest-race)

**Grassroots Vibe:** Britta Berube [RECREATIONAL] described a similar grassroots gravel event: "This event was like no other—It was grassroots, there were no big banners, the vibe was laid back, and there was a potato bar for lunch and a cook-off for dinner. It was a group of like-minded people coming together to ride, eat good food, and build community." (https://sacredrides.com/my-first-gravel-bike-race/)

**Double-Header Opportunity:** Many riders combine Safari Gravel Race with the Migration Gravel Race the following week: "Most riders take the opportunity to travel to combine both events, eventually even with the race in Rwanda" (https://ucigravelworldseries.com/en/safari-gravel-race-kenyas-inaugural-uci-event/)
