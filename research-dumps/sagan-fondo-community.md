# SAGAN FONDO — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Peter Sagan [ELITE]:** "I am really excited to come back to Southern California for some fun – I love it there and the riding and weather are too good. I am even more excited to celebrate my Green Jerseys with the Monuments of Cycling crew and all the people I will get to ride with during my Fondo. The 'Green Jersey Go-Around' competition will be like the best tour stage with lots of sprints, just don't expect me to sprint!" (https://www.petersagan.com/sagan-fondo/)

**Peter Sagan [ELITE]:** On the Truckee Dirt Edition - "all good, very hot but good." After finishing the course, he described it as "tough." (https://granfondodailynews.com/2019/11/19/1500-cyclists-ride-sagan-fondo-colombia/)

**Peter Sagan [ELITE]:** On the Colombia edition - "Another fantastic weekend in the midst of beautiful people. Returning to Colombia is always a pleasure and doing it with a beneficial purpose is even better." (https://granfondodailynews.com/2019/11/19/1500-cyclists-ride-sagan-fondo-colombia/)

**Michael Marckx (Event Creator) [UNKNOWN]:** "Monuments of Cycling is known for its world-class event productions, providing unparalleled riding experiences to top pros and aspiring amateurs alike, but it is our unique course concoctions, in beautiful North County San Diego, that set us apart from the usual Fondos." (https://socalcycling.com/2019/08/27/peter-sagan-fondo-gran-roadie-oh/)

**Michael Marckx [UNKNOWN]:** "There are no rides in San Diego where our unique topography of punchy climbs is celebrated with a large collection of Sprint Sectors for riders to compete in across all age categories. There are flat rides along the coast. There are rides that just do big climbs all day. And there is the BWR that has it all, especially dirt. We want to celebrate the hills we have in SD because there is no other place like it in the US…" (https://forum.slowtwitch.com/t/sagan-fondo-roadie-oh-bikes-bowling-and-beer/785486)

**STConcierge [UNKNOWN]:** On the San Diego event - "Great rides, food, beer, fun, and a guy popping wheelies on big climbs. What's not to love?" (https://forum.slowtwitch.com/t/sagan-fondo-roadie-oh-bikes-bowling-and-beer/785486)

**Olivia Dillon [ELITE]:** On gravel racing: "I love being off-road and away from cars. I love how the terrain is so varied and you have to be constantly alert and dodging stuff and finding the best line. You really have to focus on everything and it feels gritty and tough. These races tend to be in such beautiful areas and everyone is stoked to be there. The community aspect is so appealing and everyone is just there to have a good time and enjoy some beers afterward and tell their own personal war stories." (https://www.cxmagazine.com/olivia-dillon-interview-california-gravel-racing-2018)

**Mike Sleeter [UNKNOWN]:** On the Truckee Dirt Edition climb: "This climb had it all! Mud, rocks, sand, water, and more ROCKS! My bike set up was amazing through here. I could run a very low gear and stay seated for traction on the slippery rocks where the traditional gravel grinders would spin out and take a lot of effort to keep their cadence. This was the section that mentally broke my triathlete friend Greg Matherly! He was pissed lol!!!" (https://mytwowheellife.com/mytwowheellife/2018/6/10/peter-sagan-grand-fondo)

**Robin Schmitt (GRAN FONDO founder) [UNKNOWN]:** On riding with Sagan and Vidaurre: "We blast down the trail at Mach 10, hitting gaps, railing berms, and hucking off drops – a true, adrenaline filled, roller coaster ride. Wooosh! Sweet! It feels like a party train with good friends. Like kids playing in the woods, showing off, and egging each other on in a friendly way." (https://granfondo-cycling.com/peter-sagan-specialized-epic/)

**Mindaugas Goncaras (Sagan's mechanic) [UNKNOWN]:** "Peter is way happier now. The past three years I didn't see him this happy doing road races. And now: he changed his career path and I can immediately see the positive changes in him!" (https://granfondo-cycling.com/peter-sagan-specialized-epic/)

**Olivia Dillon [ELITE] - General gravel approach:**
- "I have always been competitive, so even if I don't train specifically for races, I do show up on the start line with plenty of fitness, determination and a willingness and need to suffer and get to the finish line as fast as possible"
- On winning strategy: "Both of those races [Lost and Found, Sagan Fondo] had plenty of climbing but not so much that her [Nash's] climbing prowess would out-race my flat power"
- Elite-level insight: gravel suits power riders when climbing isn't excessive (https://www.cxmagazine.com/olivia-dillon-interview-california-gravel-racing-2018)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Mechanical Issues:**

**Heat & Conditions:**
- Colombia edition's 90-degree heat and 70% humidity significant enough that Sagan commented on it and elite rider abandoned (https://granfondodailynews.com/2019/11/19/1500-cyclists-ride-sagan-fondo-colombia/)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Multi-Day Festival Experience:**
The Sagan Fondo is structured as a 3-day event with multiple touchpoints:

**Thursday:** Gala Dinner and Charity Auction hosted by Bill Walton at his home, featuring Erik Zabel (the rider Sagan took the record-setting 7th green jersey from). $150,000 raised across first two editions for Challenged Athletes Foundation and Outride Foundation. Live auction with exclusive Sagan gear and one-on-one experiences. (https://www.petersagan.com/sagan-fondo/, https://forum.slowtwitch.com/t/sagan-fondo-roadie-oh-bikes-bowling-and-beer/785486)

**Sunday:** Race day with Sagan riding with participants, photo opportunities, and post-race festivities.

**Participant Experience:**
"At the start/finish village in the center of North City/San Marcos on both Saturday and Sunday, participants will be able to enjoy pre- and post-race festivities from 70 vendors and local beers with Sagan." Sagan present all three days "to pose for selfies, sign autographs, mingle and present awards to the fastest riders in the 'Go-Around.'" (https://socalcycling.com/2019/08/27/peter-sagan-fondo-gran-roadie-oh/)

**Post-Race Scene:**
"After the ride, the festivities will all take place at URGE, which is a huge facility with the Mason Ale Works Brewery inside of it. There's the bowling alley, an outdoor party area for the awards ceremony and dining opportunities throughout the site... There will be beer from Rouleur, Lost Abbey and Mason Ale Works for all riders of age. URGE will be providing all riders three different lunch options." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/road/road-culture/peter-sagans-personality-meets-gran-fondo/)

**Aid Station Support:**
Mike Sleeter noted: "The aid stations were in great spots and had everything you would need from hydration, to food so you wouldn't need to carry much on you." Entry included meal ticket for post-race. (https://mytwowheellife.com/mytwowheellife/2018/6/10/peter-sagan-grand-fondo)

**Riding With Pros:**
Multiple national champions and pros ride with participants at specific time goals. "For the 150km, what time sounds fun to you: 4:30, 5:00, 5:30, 6:00, maybe 4:15, or even 4:00? Whatever your preference, you will have a pro to escort you—Maybe Peter!" (https://velo.outsideonline.com/road/road-culture/peter-sagans-personality-meets-gran-fondo/)

**Participation Numbers:**
Colombia edition had 1,500 riders (https://granfondodailynews.com/2019/11/19/1500-cyclists-ride-sagan-fondo-colombia/)

**Event Philosophy:**
Peter Sagan: "I believe what CAF does is so important. If you've been riding or running all your life and something terrible happens, how do you deal with it, how do you get back to your athletic life? We created the Gala Event to support what the Challenged Athletes Foundation does – to help people find their way back through sport."
