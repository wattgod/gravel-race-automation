# SAGAN FONDO - RAW RESEARCH DUMP

## Overview & History

The **Sagan Fondo** is a gran fondo cycling event in Truckee, California, founded by **three-time world road racing champion Peter Sagan** in 2018[4]. The event was originally established as part of Sagan's two California gran fondo events announced in partnership with event producer Bike Monkey[1][5].

## Official Race Dates

**2025 Status:** The search results do not contain confirmed 2025 race date information for the Sagan Fondo specifically.

**2026 Date:** The Sagan Fondo is scheduled for **June 27, 2026**[4][6]. However, there is conflicting historical information: the original 2018 announcement stated the first event would occur on **May 5** in Truckee on gravel and dirt roads near Lake Tahoe[1][5], indicating the event date may have shifted over time or that the May 5 date was specific to the inaugural 2018 event.

## Distance & Elevation Options

- **Short Course (30):** Actually 26.7 miles long; described as "not a beginner ride by any means" with a higher percentage of pavement to gravel compared to longer routes
- **Medium Course:** Upgraded to **66.3 miles** (new for 2026)
- **Long Course:** Over 104 miles (century-plus distance)

**User-provided information notes 75 miles and 7,000 ft elevation** — this aligns approximately with the medium course distance, though the exact elevation gain for each course tier is not specified in the search results.
