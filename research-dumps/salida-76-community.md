# SALIDA 76 — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Anonymous rider [ELITE]:** "After much trial and error, I've found, at my age and my fitness and my sanity and my grundle, that my limit is 100 miles or less along with 10,000 feet of gain or less (preferably way less) and the stats on Salida certainly fit the bill." (https://www.exploringtherockies.com/2025/09/30/salida-76-a-ride-to-a-bygone-era/)

**Anonymous rider [ELITE]:** "Race morning was partly sunny though, and ideal temps for the most part. The course started right at Riverside Park in town and quickly went up a road that quickly turned to dirt and the start of a 12-13 mile 3500' climb. No warmup but it wasn't insanely steep and it was nice to get almost 50% of the vert out of the way in the first 2 hours." (https://www.exploringtherockies.com/2025/09/30/salida-76-a-ride-to-a-bygone-era/)

**Anonymous rider [ELITE]:** "Also – the mud. I still can't believe I was able to remain on the bike the whole day. Immediately after leaving Aid 1, the mud started and forced people off the 'road' on to whatever alpine tundra was dry enough to get through... the most effective way to shed the mud was to wait until you reached a long and dry enough downhill and just bomb down it, flinging the clumps in to oblivion (and riders behind you)." (https://www.exploringtherockies.com/2025/09/30/salida-76-a-ride-to-a-bygone-era/)

**Anonymous rider [ELITE]:** "Not long after Aid 2 is when the rain started up again. Again, remaining on the bike was a chore, but fortunately for us, roughly 170-180 riders had gone before us, providing packed down mud lanes, wide enough for a 45-50MM tire to teeter on. You needed laser focus here cause if you veered 5 inches to the left or right, you were done for." (https://www.exploringtherockies.com/2025/09/30/salida-76-a-ride-to-a-bygone-era/)

**Anonymous rider [ELITE]:** "The final climb beyond Aid 3 was annoying, moderately hellacious – but it was short. I got in my absolute easiest gear and crawled up a 12-13% headwall and before I knew it, crossed the finish line." (https://www.exploringtherockies.com/2025/09/30/salida-76-a-ride-to-a-bygone-era/)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**[ELITE] - Tire width:** One rider noted that "packed down mud lanes, wide enough for a 45-50MM tire to teeter on" were created by the 170-180 riders ahead. This suggests 45-50mm tires are workable, though mud conditions may require more clearance. (https://www.exploringtherockies.com/2025/09/30/salida-76-a-ride-to-a-bygone-era/)

**[UNKNOWN] - Mud management:** Race crew provided "paint mixer sticks" for mud clearing, though the rider found bombing downhills to fling mud clumps was more effective. (https://www.exploringtherockies.com/2025/09/30/salida-76-a-ride-to-a-bygone-era/)

**[ELITE] - Gearing:** The final climb required "my absolute easiest gear" to crawl up a "12-13% headwall." Ensure you have low enough gearing for steep, technical climbs at altitude. (https://www.exploringtherockies.com/2025/09/30/salida-76-a-ride-to-a-bygone-era/)

## Weather Experienced

**2025 race year:** "It fell on a weekend that saw the most precipitation of the summer, after what seemed like 40-50 straight days of sun and dry. But that's all part of the experience right? It was a torrential downpour on me on the entire drive down there... Race morning was partly sunny though, and ideal temps for the most part." The sky turned "pretty grey" after Aid 1, with rain starting after Aid 2. "Just as it started to come down pretty good, it all of a sudden stopped and the sun and blue sky showed us the way home back to Aid 3. It got a little sloggy... Once we reached Aid 3, it was full on sun and blue sky, but a ridge to our west blocked the impending hellscape headed across the Sawatch Range valley our way."

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Opening climb:** "The course started right at Riverside Park in town and quickly went up a road that quickly turned to dirt and the start of a 12-13 mile 3500' climb. No warmup but it wasn't insanely steep and it was nice to get almost 50% of the vert out of the way in the first 2 hours." (https://www.exploringtherockies.com/2025/09/30/salida-76-a-ride-to-a-bygone-era/)

**Northeast of Salida section:** "I honestly knew nothing about the area NE of Salida, it had never registered on my radar for any reason. While a nice area with rolling hills, it appears to be a part of the state where a certain portion of the population reenacts their favorite Breaking Bad scenes. Definitely a plethora of bombed out trailer meth labs galore, some of which still appeared to be occupied." (https://www.exploringtherockies.com/2025/09/30/salida-76-a-ride-to-a-bygone-era/)

**Mud sections:** "Immediately after leaving Aid 1, the mud started and forced people off the 'road' on to whatever alpine tundra was dry enough to get through... roughly 170-180 riders had gone before us, providing packed down mud lanes, wide enough for a 45-50MM tire to teeter on. You needed laser focus here cause if you veered 5 inches to the left or right, you were done for." (https://www.exploringtherockies.com/2025/09/30/salida-76-a-ride-to-a-bygone-era/)

**Final descent:** "The race directors intelligently made the final 13 miles of the course untimed, since its all downhill and deterred anyone from going full bore and risking death to not even finish on the podium." (https://www.exploringtherockies.com/2025/09/30/salida-76-a-ride-to-a-bygone-era/)

**Course hazards:** Official notes mention "some spicy descents around mile 13 and mile 38, so please use caution." The 76km course requires "a short hike-a-bike at mile 22." (https://www.salida76.com/ride-details)

**Private property:** "The 76km course travels through private land, only accessible during the race. Many thanks to the McMurry family for letting us cross through their beautiful property." With warning: "ABSOLUTELY NO PRE-RIDING ON PRIVATE PROPERTY. Is there a gate? Then don't go through it before race day." (https://www.salida76.com/ride-details)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**[ELITE] - Nutrition strategy:** "I've implemented an electrolyte heavy fluid plan to my rides this summer, along with 3-4oz of maple syrup added and a Honey Stinger waffle ingested every hour. At the aids I slam whatever fluids remain and house half a banana and a handful of peanut M&M's and this seemed to work well for me that day." (https://www.exploringtherockies.com/2025/09/30/salida-76-a-ride-to-a-bygone-era/)

**Official cutoff times (76 Mile):**

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Remote character:** "This course is remote, beautiful, and ridden by few. Don't take this gravel pill alone, as it's out there—but we'll be your guide." (https://www.salida76.com/ride-details)

**Group dynamics [ELITE]:** "This was probably my favorite section of the race as it was just me, Ben and Kevin laughing and yelling deliriously, bombing through the mud, longing for a ray of sunshine." (https://www.exploringtherockies.com/2025/09/30/salida-76-a-ride-to-a-bygone-era/)

**Post-race [ELITE]:** "All in all, this was a great race with a lot of character, a good amount of riders and solid comraderie between the 4 of us... Ben and I, after more than a couple libations later that evening, decided we hadn't spent enough time on the saddle that day and befriended a local Salidan who offered (basically forced us) to ride his single speed cruiser bike that was lit up like a Christmas tree." (https://www.exploringtherockies.com/2025/09/30/salida-76-a-ride-to-a-bygone-era/)

**Finish line amenities:** "Full SAG, medical and support, Mystery Swag, Finish food, beer and morning coffee" with after party beginning at 11:30am featuring "food, beer and N/A for all riders." (https://www.salida76.com/ride-details)

**Community mission:** "We believe that bikes build better communities. That is why we donate a substantial part of our earnings to support community improvement projects... proceeds are directed back to the local community (HS Mtb Team, Salida Mtn Trails, and more)." (https://www.salida76.com)
