# SALTY LIZARD — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Bobby Kennedy [COMPETITIVE] (Race Director/Participant):** "It was a suspiciously glorious day in Wendover as riders lined up at the Wendover Airfield Museum for the start. Rain the week before had knocked down the dust and the temps hovered around livable." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/the-salty-lizard-100-silver-island-mountains-wendover-utah-the-third-go-round-by-bobby-kennedy/)

**Bobby Kennedy [COMPETITIVE]:** "After a quick rider meeting and lots of nervous pre-race pees, it was go time... Riders immediately faced the Aria Blvd downhill, formerly the finishing climb but now the race's first obstacle to staying upright. Riders of all abilities were taken out by the twisting descent that featured (in order): deep pea gravel, sand, bedrock, larger gravel, more sand, hardpack." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/the-salty-lizard-100-silver-island-mountains-wendover-utah-the-third-go-round-by-bobby-kennedy/)

**Bobby Kennedy [COMPETITIVE]:** "Everyone described the miles after the Leppys Pass station as the hardest. Unlike in past years, this year's course backend-loaded the climbing." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/the-salty-lizard-100-silver-island-mountains-wendover-utah-the-third-go-round-by-bobby-kennedy/)

**Bobby Kennedy [COMPETITIVE]:** "The climb arched suddenly upward to the bench at mile 81, climbing an 'unswitchbacked' dirt bike trail sprinkled with golf ball-sized stones that had been the fastest descent in previous editions of the race." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/the-salty-lizard-100-silver-island-mountains-wendover-utah-the-third-go-round-by-bobby-kennedy/)

**Betsy Welch [COMPETITIVE] (VeloNews Senior Editor):** Describing the similar Gunni Grinder race in September: "Turns out that the race was A) really hard, B) I was still really life-tired, or C) both. During post-race beer commiseration, MTB legend and IMBA president Dave Wiens assured me the answer was A, which made me feel moderately better." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/the-grind-a-not-quite-farewell-to-gravel/)

**Colin Strickland [ELITE]** on a different race but similar desert conditions: "I've been scheming a race in Marfa for a long time. It's so peaceful and beautiful and such an amazing location. It's one of my favorite places. We're gonna focus on getting out early and making sure we have an awesome camping experience for vans and tents. These are some of the darkest skies in the U.S. so being out there in the evening is so beautiful." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/the-grind-a-not-quite-farewell-to-gravel/)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Surface Variety [COMPETITIVE source]:** The Aria Blvd descent immediately after the start features a technical sequence: "deep pea gravel, sand, bedrock, larger gravel, more sand, hardpack" — riders of all abilities crashed on this section. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/the-salty-lizard-100-silver-island-mountains-wendover-utah-the-third-go-round-by-bobby-kennedy/)

**Silver Island Pass [COMPETITIVE source]:** "The traditionally loose pass had been solidified by the previous week's rain and at least all the leaders were able to ride the largest sand traps." Conditions vary significantly with weather. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/the-salty-lizard-100-silver-island-mountains-wendover-utah-the-third-go-round-by-bobby-kennedy/)

**North Side Roads [COMPETITIVE source]:** "Over the top of the pass and the rocky, black volcanic roads leading around the north end of the range" — distinctive volcanic terrain on the north side of the Silver Island Mountains. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/the-salty-lizard-100-silver-island-mountains-wendover-utah-the-third-go-round-by-bobby-kennedy/)

**Final Sections [COMPETITIVE source]:** "After a swooping descent to the I-80 aid station, it was a downhill time trial through the sand of Mt Dune to the railroad bridge... The finishing route alternated between hardpack and deep sand and pea gravel, with one particular final pass under the Hwy 93 bridge into West Wendover treating riders to a wave-like berm of soft gravel." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/the-salty-lizard-100-silver-island-mountains-wendover-utah-the-third-go-round-by-bobby-kennedy/)

**Mile 81 Climb [COMPETITIVE source]:** "The climb arched suddenly upward to the bench at mile 81, climbing an 'unswitchbacked' dirt bike trail sprinkled with golf ball-sized stones." This was described as a former fast descent, now climbed instead. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/the-salty-lizard-100-silver-island-mountains-wendover-utah-the-third-go-round-by-bobby-kennedy/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Lead Group Formation [ELITE/COMPETITIVE source]:** "A group of four formed over the fast, flat run north to Silver Island Pass... Over the top of the pass and the rocky, black volcanic roads leading around the north end of the range, they worked together, opening the traditional insurmountable gap on the rest of the field." Early cooperation is critical for contenders. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/the-salty-lizard-100-silver-island-mountains-wendover-utah-the-third-go-round-by-bobby-kennedy/)

**Women's Open Winner Strategy [ELITE source - Charlotte Backous]:** "Eventual Women's Open winner Charlotte Backous (Zone 5 Racing) made her move and started a gap on the climb over the pass that would last for the rest of the race." Attacking on the first major climb proved race-winning. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/the-salty-lizard-100-silver-island-mountains-wendover-utah-the-third-go-round-by-bobby-kennedy/)

**Aid Station Tactics [ELITE source - Bri Hoopes]:** "Women's Open runner-up... did some high-level gravel strategizing and turned an extra-speedy stop at the Leppy's aid station into a gap and a spot higher on the podium." Fast transitions matter at elite level. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/the-salty-lizard-100-silver-island-mountains-wendover-utah-the-third-go-round-by-bobby-kennedy/)

**Key Selection Points [ELITE source]:** "Eventual Men's Open winner David Christenson and runner-up Tanner Visnick (Rockhorn Racing/Park City Bike and Demo) took off, with Christenson attacking shortly before the aid station and opening a gap that he would hold until the end of the race." The late-race attack before Leppys Pass aid proved decisive. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/the-salty-lizard-100-silver-island-mountains-wendover-utah-the-third-go-round-by-bobby-kennedy/)

**Hardest Section [COMPETITIVE source - general consensus]:** "Everyone described the miles after the Leppys Pass station as the hardest. Unlike in past years, this year's course backend-loaded the climbing." Budget energy for the final third. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/the-salty-lizard-100-silver-island-mountains-wendover-utah-the-third-go-round-by-bobby-kennedy/)

## Weather Experienced

**October 2022 Conditions [COMPETITIVE source]:** "It was a suspiciously glorious day in Wendover as riders lined up... Rain the week before had knocked down the dust and the temps hovered around livable." Pre-race rain improved dust conditions and made sandy sections more rideable. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/the-salty-lizard-100-silver-island-mountains-wendover-utah-the-third-go-round-by-bobby-kennedy/)

**Impact of Rain [COMPETITIVE source]:** "The traditionally loose pass had been solidified by the previous week's rain and at least all the leaders were able to ride the largest sand traps." Weather in the week before dramatically affects course conditions, particularly sandy sections.

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Finish Line Scene [COMPETITIVE source]:** "A skidding stop in the dirt next to the Historic Wendover Airfield Museum where race director John Hernandez and a growing welcoming party sat tailgating the finish line. And, most importantly, free fry bread." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/the-salty-lizard-100-silver-island-mountains-wendover-utah-the-third-go-round-by-bobby-kennedy/)

**Pre-Race Atmosphere [COMPETITIVE source]:** "The Historic Wendover Airfield Museum buzzed as riders bombed down from hotels and emptied out of cars newly arrived from the Wasatch Front. The smell of bacon hung in the air over the camping area and the soft hiss of aerosol lubricants accentuated the rustling of many bodies and bikes preparing." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/the-salty-lizard-100-silver-island-mountains-wendover-utah-the-third-go-round-by-bobby-kennedy/)

**Weekend Format [COMPETITIVE source]:** The Salty Lizard is part of "Salty & Stupid Gravel Fest" where "racers and participants can enjoy/suffer as much or as little as they want to." Options include 45-mile Fundo to 300-mile Stupid Lizard double. (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/the-grind-a-not-quite-farewell-to-gravel/)

**Race Philosophy [COMPETITIVE source]:** "For those worrying about the UCI ruining gravel, a weekend racing in Wendover, Utah could change that... no one will be checking sock height out on the Utah/Nevada border." Grassroots, anti-establishment vibe. (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/the-grind-a-not-quite-farewell-to-gravel/)

**Location Benefits [UNKNOWN source]:** "Welcome to Wendover, a salty land that's full of adventure! It's less than 2 hours to get here from Salt Lake City... There are plenty of incredible sights to explore, and post race recovery can include a variety of adult style fun at the casinos." (https://utahgravelseries.com/saltylizard)

**Prize Purse [COMPETITIVE source]:** "Thanks to a new grant from the Nevada Board of Tourism, organizers put up a prize pot of $3,000 paying five deep to the women's and men's Open category riders." Professional-level prize money in 2022. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/the-salty-lizard-100-silver-island-mountains-wendover-utah-the-third-go-round-by-bobby-kennedy/)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Technical Descent Crashes [COMPETITIVE source]:** "After a quick rider meeting and lots of nervous pre-race pees... Riders of all abilities were taken out by the twisting descent [Aria Blvd downhill]" in the first miles. Early technical section claims victims across all ability levels. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/the-salty-lizard-100-silver-island-mountains-wendover-utah-the-third-go-round-by-bobby-kennedy/)

**Mechanical Issues [ELITE source]:** Even top contenders suffer: one rider "flatted out of the lead group, made it back, then got hit by two more flats and was stuck riding the inserts of an unrepairable tyre for a considerable period" (context from 2024 Unbound but relevant to understanding equipment failures in similar terrain).
