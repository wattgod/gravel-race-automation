# SANTA FE CENTURY GRAVELÓN — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**[ELITE/COMPETITIVE - Official Race Requirements]:** "Each rider needs a multiple gear bike with a low gear for hill climbing in good mechanical condition, with a tire width of at least 35 mm recommended. A bicycle tune up prior to the event is highly recommended. Helmets meeting CPSC standards are mandatory. In addition, each cyclist must carry a spare tube, a patch kit, pump or CO2 cartridges and basic tools. Each rider should carry extra water." (https://www.santafecentury.com/gravelon-fondo/)

## Weather Experienced

**Course Modification Risk:** "In the event of wet conditions, it may become necessary to modify the course for the Gravelon due to the formation of mud and clay on Rowe Mesa, which creates extremely difficult riding conditions. The Gravelon route is optimally ridden when the surface is dry, and wet conditions present significant challenges to navigating muddy terrain." (https://www.santafecentury.com/gravelon-fondo/)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Course Profile [ELITE]:** "This route features a mix of rough dirt roads, pavement and rolling gravel roads of the mesas and high desert just south of the terminus of the Rockies... The first 14.8 miles of the clockwise loop begins on Forest roads that wind through the Ponderosa groves and grasslands of the transition zone typical of northern New Mexico. The right turn onto Highway 34 marks the beginning of 9 miles of a fast paved section without any big climbs and a change into the shorter trees of the piñon/juniper forest. The remaining 30 miles are all on improved dirt/gravel roads with a mix of rolling terrain with some moderate but longer climbs back to the start/finish. There is a total of 3,100' of climbing on the route." (https://www.santafecentury.com/gravelon-fondo/)

**Starting Location:** "The start/finish is located just inside the boundary of the Santa Fe National Forest off of Forest Road 326 on Rowe Mesa, a 20 minute drive southeast of Santa Fe. Parking will be available in a pull-out off of the forest road and on the shoulder of the road." (https://www.santafecentury.com/gravelon-fondo/)
