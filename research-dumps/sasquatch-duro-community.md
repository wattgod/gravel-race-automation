## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Jonathan Maus [UNKNOWN]:** "I did the Big Squatch course and enjoyed almost every minute. I say 'almost' because I didn't feel great on the big climb at the start and once I recovered it was too late to catch back onto the lead groups... After the peak, the day's real fun began. We careened down National Forest Road 1928 and hung a sharp left on the legendary Aufderheide Scenic Byway. Ripping along the pavement with the majestic Willamette over my shoulder was a treat... I felt like I flew down that descent! The corners seemed to melt away as I held onto my bars and carved the damp dirt with full trust that my brain, body, and bike would do the right things." (https://bikeportland.org/2019/05/20/oakridge-and-westfir-host-sasquatch-duro-gravel-event-299959)

**Jonathan Maus [UNKNOWN]** on the Oakridge course climb: "Once we left Aufderheide, we crossed the river and headed (what felt like) straight up for six grueling miles. We punched out over 2,600 feet of climbing to get to Windy Pass, before an eight mile descent took us back down to the river." (https://bikeportland.org/2019/05/20/oakridge-and-westfir-host-sasquatch-duro-gravel-event-299959)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Oakridge Course (2019):**
The Big Squatch was "about equal parts pavement and dirt" with surfaces ranging from smooth gravel to technical descents. The course went off-road at mile 7, climbed to approximately 2,800 feet (starting elevation 1,200 ft), then descended on National Forest Road 1928 before joining the Aufderheide Scenic Byway along the Willamette River.

The major climb was NF 1912: "six grueling miles" gaining "over 2,600 feet of climbing to get to Windy Pass" followed by "an eight mile descent" back to the river. The course crossed First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth creeks. The last two miles were "paved and flat on the Aufderheide Byway."

Described as "smooth gravel to rugged paths" through "rolling vineyards, forests, and farmland" with quieter roads than the Oakridge location. (https://www.mudslingerevents.com/sasquatch-duro)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Tire Selection [UNKNOWN LEVEL]:** "Nearly everyone was on a drop-bar road bike with tires ranging from about 35-45 mm in size (for reference, most Tour de France racers ride 25 mm tires)." Very few riders used mountain bikes despite Oakridge being the "Mountain Biking Capital of the Northwest."
