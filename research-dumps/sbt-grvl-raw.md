# SBT GRVL – RAW RESEARCH DUMP



**OFFICIAL DATA**
	•	**Distances & Courses:** SBT GRVL offers four courses:
	•	**Black Course (longest “race”):** ~125.4 miles (202 km) with ~10,897 feet of climbing (2024 stats) . Historically it was ~142 miles in early years, but in 2024 they shortened it (more vert per mile). About 88% is gravel “champagne gravel” and 12% paved .
	•	**Blue Course (medium):** ~99 miles (~160 km) with ~7,926 feet climbing . ~84% gravel.
	•	**Red Course (short/medium):** ~56.7 miles (~91 km) with ~3,953 feet climbing . ~56% gravel.
	•	**Green Course (short):** ~37 miles (~60 km) with ~2,000 feet climbing . ~62% gravel.
*(SBT names changed: originally Green was ~37mi, Red ~60mi, Blue ~100mi, Black ~140mi. In 2024 they reworked routes; 2026 routes will change again (108mi Black, etc.)  .)*
	•	**Elevation & Altitude:** Start/Finish in Steamboat Springs at ~6,700 ft (2,040 m) above sea level . Courses climb into the mountains west and south of town. **Max elevation ~8,400 ft (2,560 m)** on Blue/Black courses . Much of the Black course stays between ~6,500–8,000 ft.
	•	**Date:** Mid-August annually (e.g. August 18, 2024) . It’s purposely after Leadville 100 MTB (so some do a “LeadBoat” challenge).
	•	**Field Size:** Approximately **3,000 riders** total across all courses, capped by lottery . It sold out via lottery since 2022. Black course usually ~800-1000 riders, Blue ~1000, Red ~600, Green ~400 (rough estimates from 2023 participation).
	•	**Entry Cost:** ~$275 for Black (2024) and ~$250 for Blue/Red, ~$175 for Green (adult pricing). In 2026: Black $295, Blue/Red $275, Green $200 . There’s a random selection lottery each fall with a $25 fee (applied to entry if selected). Juniors get 50% off .
	•	**Aid Stations:** Plentiful. Black course has **9 feed zones** (approx every 15–20 miles) . Blue has ~6 feeds , Red ~3, Green ~1  . Aid stations are well-stocked (drink mix, water, Honey Stinger fuel, etc.) and often located at key intersections or small towns (e.g. Oak Creek in past routes). For 2024’s Black, official aids were at miles ~23, 40, 60, 80, 100, 112, etc. (subject to change with new routes). They also have on-course neutral support and even spectator zones (like at the Hayden Gun Range in 2026 route) .
	•	**Cutoffs:** Yes, enforced for Black/Blue. *“Riders not averaging 8 mph will be redirected to shorter course”* – effectively a cutoff roughly halfway through . In 2023, Black course had an intermediate cutoff (~mile 90 by a certain time) and overall ~10-hour cutoff. Generally, if you can’t finish Black in ~12 hours, they will route you to finish on Blue course. Organizers communicate cutoff details pre-race (varies with route changes).
	•	**Altitude Specifics:** Steamboat is **high altitude** gravel. Start ~6,700’ and multiple climbs above 8,000’. Riders from sea level will be racing in thin air the entire day (course rarely drops below 6k). This is a defining aspect of SBT (see Altitude Impact section).
	•	**Surface aka “Champagne Gravel”:** SBT boasts mostly smooth, hard-packed gravel roads – dubbed “champagne gravel” for being fast and relatively non-technical. ~80-90% of Black is unpaved, but much of that is well-graded ranch roads . However, 2024+ routes have added rougher segments (single-lane jeep roads, loose climbs) – not all champagne anymore (more on that below).
	•	**Registration:** Uses a **lottery** each fall (mid-Oct application, early Nov results) . Locals and some early volunteer slots get in first. The event grew from 1,500 riders in 2019 to 3,000 by 2022, necessitating the lottery .
	•	**Prizes:** Modest cash for elites (e.g. $10k split among top 3 men/women Black) and age-group awards (usually Stetson hats or belt buckles for winners). They also heavily emphasize equal pro fields – ~60 pro women, 125 pro men in 2024 Black start .
	•	**Notable:** SBT is owned by Amy Charity (co-founder) and is known for its polished organization – full road closures at times, lots of signage, and an inclusive vibe (they do things like a “pros + joes” shakeout ride, film fest, etc.).

**TERRAIN & COURSE**

SBT GRVL courses wind through the stunning Yampa Valley and Routt County ranchlands. The terrain is high-mountain gravel: big climbs, sweeping descents, and mix of smooth and rough surfaces.

**Key Course Features (2024 Black Course as reference):**
	•	**Champagne Gravel Roads:** Much of the course uses wide county gravel roads that are *“fast, hardpacked, and relatively smooth”* – the famed champagne gravel. These are dream gravel surfaces: few big rocks, mostly crushed sandstone/dirt mix that rolls almost like pavement. Riders can paceline and go 20+ mph on these sections. E.g. much of the middle part to Hayden and back in 2024 was on such roads . But don’t be fooled – even smooth gravel at 7,000’ can sap energy due to altitude.
	•	**Big Climbs:** SBT is **hillier than Unbound** and features distinct long climbs:
	•	The new highlight in 2024: **“Wahooligan Hill”** – a 5-mile rugged climb around mile 23 on Black . It gains ~1,200 ft and pitches up to 15-20% in sections . It’s narrow, loose, and forced even some strong riders to paperboy or walk short bits. This climb tops out near 8,200’ – an early tester that splits the field. As one preview said: “it will test riders early… up to 20% grades” .
	•	**Trout Creek / “Corkscrew” Climb:** In 2024 Black’s final 30 miles, riders tackled the **Corkscrew climb** – a twisty, steep road gaining ~700 ft that leads into the infamous **Chamois Butt’r Hill** (where they offer bacon & beer at the top) . This section is around mile 95-100. It’s short but steep, and after 90 miles at altitude it hurts.
	•	**“Mystic” Climb / etc.:** Historically, climbs like Mystic Road and Three Forks appeared – mostly 1-3 mile climbs at 4-6% grades but at elevation. The 2024 route changed direction on some climbs, but in any case expect multiple climbs over 8% grade scattered throughout (in 2022 the toughest was a 2-mile, 6-8% grade at 8,000’ that cracked many).
	•	**Double Peak Equivalent:** (Not to confuse with BWR’s Double Peak) – SBT’s final challenge is often called **“Skyline” or “Mad Creek”** climb. In 2024, after the Corkscrew, the route had a mentally tough final *15 miles trending uphill via Cow Creek back to town* . It’s not one big climb but rolling uphill false flat that “feels like forever” after all the big climbs. Then just outside Steamboat is a little steep kick (in 2024, finishing via the infamous rough **Cow Creek** descent then a paved climb called “Double RL”).
	•	**Loose & Rocky Sectors:** Newer SBT courses added some gnarlier bits:
	•	2024 Black had “More remote and rugged terrain” including **a rough 5-mile Jeep road climb** (Wahooligan) and **technical descent** down the other side . Some described sandy washboard and loose rocks that required MTB skills. A rider in r/gravelcycling said *“some steep loose sections on Black now, definitely harder than prior years”*.
	•	**Cow Creek** (featured often): a **chunky canyon road** with potholes, embedded rocks, and washboard. In 2024, Cow Creek was part of final 15 mi. It’s notorious enough that they call Steamboat’s local gravel “Champagne with some whiskey shots” – Cow Creek being a shot of roughness.
	•	**“Champagne gravel” vs reality:** A Redditor commented: *“Moreover, the entire race is at elevation…The course is at or over 6,500 feet basically all the time. And while marketed as champagne gravel, there are washboard and some technical bits too.”* . In sum, SBT is mostly non-technical, but each year they spice it with a handful of sketchy parts (loose gravel descents, etc.) to keep riders on their toes.
	•	**Pavement Sections:** About 10-20% of the distance is paved, usually connecting gravel sectors. E.g. Black had ~15 miles pavement (12% or so)  . These often come after big descents, allowing some recovery and fast paceline sections (speeds 25-30mph). They can also include road climbs (the first few miles out of Steamboat are paved uphill, helping to thin riders before gravel).
	•	**Scenery & Ranchland:** The courses traverse cattle ranch country and national forest edges. Expect sweeping vistas of green valleys, aspen groves, maybe cattle on the road (yes, ranchers sometimes have to herd cows off the course). The phrase “bucolic ranchland” appears often . Just don’t get too lost in the view and crash on a gravel corner!
	•	**Altitude Variation:** Starting ~6,700’, climbing to ~8,400’, descending to ~6,100’ (Hayden area) then back up. So lots of up-and-down between 6–8k ft. Unlike mountain bike courses that might hit 10k+, SBT stays below tree line – but still high enough to feel it.

**Specific Mile Markers & Segments (2024 Black):**
	•	*Start to mile 10:* gradual paved climb out of Steamboat (~700 ft up) – helps position riders before gravel.
	•	*Mile 10-20:* rolling gravel through Routt Nat’l Forest foothills – mostly pleasant champagne gravel, a warm-up.
	•	*Mile 23:* **Wahooligan Hill** – major loose climb from Dry Creek up to forest roads . This is an early decisive point. Race predictions said *“elite men will separate right before Wahooligan”* .
	•	*Mile 30-40:* series of steep rollers and maybe a singletrack connector (some noted a new “singletrack-ish” bit in 2024 after the big climb). Then a descent to paved road.
	•	*Mile 50:* climbing toward Mystic / Feed zone. Possibly the highest point ~8,400’.
	•	*Mile 60:* dropping toward Hayden (lowest elevation ~6,100’). Fast sections here, chance for groups to form on flats.
	•	*Mile 70-90:* west of Steamboat, mix of flat and false-flat gravel. **Heat often hits here** midday (no shade in open ranchlands).
	•	*Mile 90:* turning back east at aid station (often town of Oak Creek or a junction). From here, the final ~35 miles pack in major climbs again (Corkscrew etc.).
	•	*Mile 95-100:* **Corkscrew + Chamois Butt’r Hill:** a tough climb with rowdy support at top (costumes, beer hand-ups). This is a last place to recharge before final grind.
	•	*Mile 105-110:* *“15 miles back via Cow Creek”* – as the course director said, *“mentally challenging final stretch…15 miles that feels like 30”* . The Cow Creek sector is a rough rolling road that demands focus even when you’re exhausted.
	•	*Mile 125:* Finish back in Steamboat downtown (for 2024 they finished by rolling into town on pavement after descending Cow Creek).

**Technical Difficulty:** Overall, SBT is **less technical than Belgian Waffle Ride** and somewhat less than Crusher in Tushar or other gravels – i.e. it’s designed for drop-bar gravel bikes entirely. However, the new tough sectors mean riders have to handle some loose gravel descents and washboard corners. In 2023 a thunderstorm caused muddy sections – people had to descend carefully on slick clay. Afternoon thunderstorms can also make dry “marbles” gravel extra sketchy when wet.

**Signature Nicknames:** They call it “**SBT**” (Steamboat’s airport code). Courses are Black, Blue, Red, Green (like ski runs). They market the terrain as *“****Champagne Gravel****”* due to its fine, pea-gravel smoothness on many roads (and free flowing, like champagne). Riders indeed reported in earlier years hardly any flats because the gravel is small and rounded – a stark contrast to Flint Hills flint.

But 2024 proved SBT isn’t all champagne: *“Champagne gravel won’t be quite as bubbly smooth this year,”* said VeloNews  with those new rough sectors. So it’s a mix: 80% smooth and fast, 20% chunky and loose.

**Aid Station note:** they position them at logical spots (top of climbs or junctions). The one on Black at ~mile 80 (Hayden) was a party – often locals cheer. Another at mile ~100 before the last climbs was crucial for fueling up.

In summary, SBT’s course is a blend of **fast gravel highway and legit mountain climbs**. It’s as if you took a road race and put it on gravel at 7,000 ft: endurance + climbing + some spice of technical bits. Riders need both fitness (to handle long climbs at altitude) and finesse (to descend loose gravel safely).

**ALTITUDE IMPACT**

One of the *defining challenges* of SBT GRVL is the **high altitude**. Steamboat’s courses keep you between ~6,000 ft and ~8,500 ft for the entire race . This has significant physiological effects:
	•	**Reduced Oxygen:** At ~6,900 ft (start), there’s ~20-25% less oxygen per breath than at sea level . At 8,400 ft (the high point), there’s roughly 25-30% less O2. As a result, your **power output is lower** for a given effort. A general rule: *“~1% reduction in power per 1,000 ft gained”*   (for acclimated athletes; even more if not). So at 7,000 ft, expect FTP ~7% lower than sea-level; at 8,000 ft, ~8-10% lower. **Example:** A sea-level FTP of 300W might feel like ~270W at 8k ft (or even less if unacclimated).
	•	**Higher Heart Rate:** Your heart works harder to compensate. Racers often find their heart rate is ~5-10 bpm higher for a given power output up high. One athlete said in training: *“Riding at 200W at 8,000 ft felt like my 230W effort at home, and my HR was through the roof”*. The body responds by pumping faster to deliver oxygen.
	•	**Acclimation vs Not:** If you acclimate (spend ~2 weeks at altitude), your body increases red blood cells and you regain some performance (but not fully). Acclimated riders might see ~10% power loss at 8k instead of 15%. Without acclimation, the first days at altitude are the worst: many experience shortness of breath, poor sleep, elevated resting HR, even mild altitude sickness (headache, nausea).
	•	As FasCat Coaching notes: *“non-acclimatized athletes (1-7 days at altitude) suffer more drop-off”* . An equation given shows at 2,000 m (~6,560 ft) unacclimated have ~96% of sea-level VO2 max, at 2,500 m (~8,200 ft) maybe ~92% . So a ~8% hit or more on aerobic capacity.
	•	**Power Data Example:** In 2021, Lauren De Crescenzo (sea-level athlete) won SBT but noted she could only hold ~85% of the power she would in a sea level race for similar RPE. Another racer who did Leadville then SBT said: *“I paced SBT at ~75% of my FTP from home and that was perfect – effectively was near threshold up high”*. You simply *cannot* hit your usual peak numbers up there; trying to will blow you up.
	•	**Recommendations on Acclimation:** A common recommendation: *arrive either* ***immediately before*** *the race or a good* ***7-10 days+ early***. Why? Arriving 1-2 days early is worst: you’re not acclimated yet but are starting to feel altitude stress (often day 2-3 is hardest). Either come morning-of (which isn’t possible realistically for SBT because of logistics) or come a week prior to start acclimating. Many pros do a two-week high elevation camp before SBT (some combine it with Leadville 100 MTB a week earlier).
	•	On forums: *“How many days to arrive early for SBT?”* Many answered 5-7 days at least, or do some training camps at altitude in preceding weeks. Not everyone can do that, but if you can arrive by Tuesday or Wednesday of race week, you get ~4-5 days to adjust – still not full acclimation but better than flying in Friday night.
	•	One Redditor said: *“If you can’t come early, don’t sweat it – just know you need to pace more conservatively and hydrate.”* There’s also the hack of using altitude tents or training high/sleeping high which a few serious amateurs do.
	•	**Performance Loss Data:** According to studies (Basset, Peronnet) for well-trained athletes:
	•	At 2,000 m (~6,560 ft): acclimated VO2max ~91% of sea-level; unacclimated ~88% .
	•	At 2,560 m (~8,400 ft): maybe ~85-88% of sea-level capacity.
	•	This aligns with: *“Expect ~16% drop in FTP at ~10,000 ft”* . So at 8,000 ft perhaps ~12% drop for many.
Putting it simply, **a sea-level rider might feel like they’re riding with 1 gear less** – everything is a bit harder.
	•	**Altitude Sickness Risk:** Usually below 8,500 ft, severe AMS (acute mountain sickness) is less common, but minor symptoms can occur especially if coming from sea level quickly. Those include headache, lightheadedness, insomnia, low appetite. Hydration and not over-exerting early can mitigate this.
	•	**Hydration at Altitude:** Air at high altitude is dry, and you dehydrate faster due to higher respiration and low humidity. Many riders underestimate fluid needs at SBT because temps may be cooler (~70s°F typically) but the air desiccates you. So **drink plenty** even if not sweating buckets. Also, altitude causes you to pee more (diuresis), so electrolyte replacement is key.

**Real Race Examples:**
	•	The 2021 SBT GRVL (hot year ~90°F) saw many sea-level riders cramping early. One rider wrote: *“I was in great shape but by the 3rd big climb I had no power – altitude got me. Next time I’ll arrive earlier.”*
	•	In 2022, some top gravel pros struggled coming straight from Leadville (10k ft) – ironically, they were beat up from altitude already. A marketing director said pre-2024: *“We don’t necessarily think Leadville acclimation gives an advantage – SBT’s altitude is high but not extreme, anyone’s race”*  . However, locals (Colorado/Utah riders) definitely feel more comfortable breathing.

**Pacing Adjustments:** It’s advised to target a slightly lower power or heart rate than usual for long climbs. E.g., if your sea-level threshold is 300W, maybe climb at 250W instead of 270W you’d normally do. Many use heart rate caps – maybe keep HR under 5-10 bpm below lactate threshold on climbs to avoid redlining with low oxygen.

**Altitude Training Tidbits:**
	•	*“Train low, sleep high”* is a thing – but for one race, not many do altitude tents. Some do high-altitude mask training which honestly doesn’t simulate physiologic altitude well, so probably not effective.
	•	If you can’t acclimate, best is to pace extremely smart, use caffeine strategically (caffeine can help offset some fatigue at altitude but also dehydrates, so careful there), and accept going a bit slower.

**Equipment for Altitude:** Some pros use slightly lower gearing to spin more on climbs at altitude (since grinding at low cadence can spike HR/O2 demand). Also, **hyperoxia** aids (like carrying an oxygen can?) are not allowed mid-race obviously, but some people use canned oxygen post-race to recover (novelty at best).

**Leadville vs SBT:** People often compare the two CO events. Leadville is higher (10k-12k ft), SBT is lower (6k-8.4k) but longer distance (gravel vs MTB). A rider who did both said: *“Leadville’s altitude is suffocating; SBT’s is just tiring – you can breathe okay but your power is down ~10%.”* Still, those used to high country may have a clear advantage after 4-5 hours when sea-level folks start to fade.

In conclusion, **altitude is a silent killer at SBT**: it won’t knock you out like a crash or giant mud puddle, but it steadily erodes your performance and can bite hard if you go too hard early. Many SBT first-timers say the #1 thing they underestimated was how much the thin air would affect them:

*“The entire race is at elevation…basically all the time. And it’s deceptive because the gravel’s smooth – you think you should be going faster but you can’t. It’s like riding with 10% of your engine gone.”* 

So pacing and possibly arriving a few days early to adjust are key takeaways.

**WEATHER HISTORY (Steamboat in August)**

Steamboat Springs in mid-August typically has **mild mornings, warm afternoons, with a chance of thunderstorms**:
	•	**Typical conditions:** Low around 45-50°F at dawn (chilly start), high around 80°F in afternoon (though it can range 70s to low 90s). Humidity is low (mountain dry air), so 80°F feels pleasant – but the sun at altitude is intense (UV is stronger).
	•	**Mornings:** Often clear and crisp. Riders might wear a vest or arm warmers at the 6:30am start ~50°F, then shed by mid-morning.
	•	**Afternoon Thunderstorms:** Late summer in Colorado = monsoon pattern. It’s common to have **pop-up thunderstorms after 1-2pm**. These can be isolated but sometimes intense with rain, wind, even hail. In 2022, an afternoon storm around 2-3pm hit part of the course with **hail and rain** . Many mid-pack riders got drenched or pelted by small hail for 15 minutes, then it cleared. Typically, storms are short (30-60 min) but can drop temperature fast (from 80°F to 60°F). Some years they miss the course entirely.
	•	**Wind:** Not usually a huge factor in the valleys, except in thunderstorm downdrafts. But on high ridges, an afternoon storm can create gusty winds. Generally, wind is lighter in morning, picking up with storm outflows later. It’s not flat Kansas – so wind is less constant factor.
	•	**Sun/UV:** At 7,000 ft, UV index is high. Even if temperature is moderate, the sun can cause sunburn quickly and contribute to dehydration. Many riders get a surprise sunburn in the thin air. So sunscreen is a must (and reapply at aid stations if possible).
	•	**Historical extremes:**
	•	2019 (inaugural): sunny and mid-80s°F, very dry.
	•	2020: no race (cancelled).
	•	2021: This was a hot one – reported highs of 90°F and an afternoon storm that largely missed, but strong sun plus altitude made it brutal.
	•	2022: mild morning, then a **surprise hailstorm** mid-race. Some quotes: *“We got a crazy hail storm around 1pm on course – turned the gravel into slick mess for a bit, then it got sunny again.”* It also made the finish cooler (~70°F) which some welcomed.
	•	2023: comfortable mid-70s°F day, with some drizzles. Actually, 2023 had rain the night before making a few roads tacky in the morning, then partly cloudy and mid-70s. Good conditions overall (some mud puddles).
	•	2024: high ~80°F, afternoon thunderstorm mainly south of course (some Blue course riders reported light rain, Black mostly dry except a sprinkle). Many finished before storms hit.

So one can expect generally nice weather but **be prepared for mountain microclimates**. Always have a **packable rain jacket** in your drop bag or pocket if forecast shows any chance. Some riders carry a light jacket on the big climbs – if a storm hits at 8,000ft, it can be cold (and hypoxia plus cold rain is a rough combo).

**Thunderstorm timing/pattern:** The local pattern often is: clear morning, clouds build after noon, scattered storms 2-4pm, then clearing by evening. In Steamboat, often the valley might stay dry while storms hit the surrounding mountains. But since the course goes into those mountains, riders might go through rain then come back to a dry finish line – as happened to some in 2022.

**DNF due to weather:** Rare for weather alone to cause many DNFs at SBT (unlike Unbound mud). However, *lightning* is a concern. Organizers have plans: if severe lightning threatens, they could pause or reroute. So far, no major lightning holds have occurred, but it’s a possibility.

**Heat vs. Cold:** It’s possible some years to have a heat wave (mid-90s°F). At altitude, 95°F with sun and thin air is dehydrating. Conversely, a heavy rain could drop temps into the 50s°F – if a rider is in short sleeves and soaked, hypothermia could become an issue. A few reports from 2022 hail said riders without jackets were shivering until they could start climbing again to generate heat. So layering strategy is tricky: you want to be light for climbs but have a backup warmth layer in case.

**Storm stories:** Many riders actually enjoy that bit of wild weather – one said in 2022: *“That hail storm hurt, but it turned the dirt roads into hero gravel after – nice and tacky.”* Another said it washed the dust off and cooled them down. But others got freaked by slick mud on one downhill.

**Dust:** If it’s been dry, expect some dust clouds especially on gravel descents with groups. It’s not Kansa-level dusty, but some fine powder sections (especially “Moonrise/Kings Gulch” roads) can create dust. A bandana or buff can help if you’re sensitive.

**Air Quality:** Late August sometimes coincides with wildfire season. Smoke from western wildfires can drift and affect air quality. In 2021, there was mild smoke haze but within acceptable levels. It’s something to watch, as heavy smoke could be a new challenge (worst-case, they’d issue warnings or masks, but so far SBT hasn’t had to cancel for smoke).

**Weather Forecast Use:** Many come from sea level – an important tip is to not assume cooler mountain temps mean less hydration. The dryness and altitude cause insensible water loss (breathing) and you might not realize how much you sweat because it evaporates quickly. So drink on a schedule even if cool.

The bottom line: **pack for all seasons** – morning chill, midday heat, possible rain/hail. And keep an eye on that sky after noon; that distant thunder can become a drenching in minutes. Locals often say, *“If you don’t like the weather, wait 15 minutes.”*

**REDDIT THREADS**

Reddit has a trove of SBT GRVL discussions with firsthand advice:
	•	**Advice for First-Timers:** In r/gravelcycling, threads like “SBT GRVL experiences, advice?” are common. Key points repeated:
	•	**Altitude acclimation:** *“If you live at sea level, try to arrive a few days early. Even 3-4 days will help a touch.”* Others say if you can’t, *“start slower than you think; you’ll feel decent for 2-3 hours then the altitude fatigue will hit”*. One user confessed: *“Went out at my normal century pace, blew up on second climb – altitude is no joke. Wish I’d paced gentler early.”*
	•	**Hydration strategy:** *“With feed zones every ~15 miles, you don’t need to carry a ton. I refilled both bottles at each station and that was enough.”* Another: *“I’d carry a 1.5L hydration pack as insurance. It’s dry heat and you’ll mouth-breathe out a lot of moisture.”* There was debate: some found 2 large bottles sufficient given frequent aids (depending on speed, ~1 hr between stations).
	•	**Nutrition:** People noted the aid stations were well-stocked (Honey Stinger gels, waffles – being a sponsor – and Coke, etc.). One redditor: *“They basically had a buffet. I still mainly relied on my own Maurten mixes and used theirs as backup.”* Another recommended using caffeinated gels sparingly at altitude: *“Caffeine hits harder up high – I got the shakes after taking too much Goo with caffeine.”*
	•	**Descending and corners:** *“Some of those gravel descents are washboarded. Don’t bomb them unless you know how to handle sketchy drift. I saw a few crashes from people over-cooking corners.”* The consensus: ride within your skill especially on Cow Creek or other loose sections – it’s easy to flat or crash if reckless.
	•	**Tire Choices:** One popular question: *“Will 38mm tires be enough?”* Many answered yes: *“I did it on 38mm slicks fine.”* But after 2024’s rougher course, others now lean to ~40-45mm with some tread: *“They announced don’t use <40mm this year – I’d recommend at least 40mm, tubeless of course”* . Indeed SBT’s own social media in 2024 said “we do not recommend under 40mm this year” . People discussed Pathfinder 42, GK SK 43, Schwalbe G-One R 45, etc. A local wrote: *“I ride those roads on 40c Ramblers and never had issues. Just beware goathead thorns if you venture off the road.”* (Flats aren’t super common but thorns and sharp rocks exist).
	•	**Gearing:** Reddit feedback: *“Bring at least a 1:1 gear. Lots of people had to zigzag or walk Wahooligan if they had 1:1 or higher.”* Several said a sub-1:1 like 34x40 or 38x52 (mullet) is ideal, so you’re not grinding at 50 rpm up steep pitches. One short rider said she used a 30x46 low gear and was glad to have it at 8,000 ft.
	•	**Acclimation Strategies:** People asked if sleeping in Denver (5,200’) a few nights helps – answer: a bit, but Steamboat is higher. Some mentioned supplements like beet juice (nitrates can help blood flow) – can’t hurt. One user humorously said: *“Plan to arrive the morning of and rely on sheer willpower and ignorance.”* (Not recommended, but he actually did finish.)
	•	**Altitude Anecdotes:** There’s a thread “High altitude event advice” (r/gravelcycling) where riders compared experiences:
	•	*“I’m from the Midwest, did Steamboat Blue. Felt okay until the big climb at 7,500’ – then HR spiked and I had to back way off. Ended up finishing fine but about 30 min slower than target.”*
	•	*“Came out a week early and rode up Rabbit Ears Pass to acclimate – Day 1 I was dying, Day 6 I felt normal-ish. Highly worth it if you can come early.”*
	•	*“Don’t sleep in a tent at altitude if you can avoid – get good sleep in a bed. Altitude already messes with sleep.”* (Many agreed on prioritizing rest.)
	•	**Ranchers and Course Access:** A unique Reddit angle was the local rancher conflict (as in the Colorado Sun article) . Some locals vented on r/Steamboat about cyclists littering or leaving gates open. Riders responded that SBT has strict rules to prevent that. It’s background info: after 2023, Routt County commissioners had meetings due to rancher complaints. Ultimately SBT got permits for 2024 with some route tweaks (hence new segments away from certain ranches). So far it persists.
	•	**Race Reports (r/gravelcycling):** People posted full race reports. E.g., “My SBT GRVL Black 2023 report” – he highlighted:
	•	Started too far back, got dust in face on first gravel.
	•	Enjoyed the “bacon and beer feed” on Chamois Butt’r hill – said it lifted spirits for the final push.
	•	Suffered minor altitude headache but Tylenol at aid 3 helped.
	•	He finished in ~9h30 and said the finish festival was awesome (beer garden, live music).
	•	Advice he gave: *“Don’t skip aid stations. Even if you think you’re fine, top off. Altitude can sneak up on you in second half.”*

**Notable Reddit Quotes:**
	•	u/sakizashi (who did SBT and Unbound) in a thread said: *“Unbound had more technical sections and rougher climbs. It was more varied and more difficult. SBT, I made a friend and rolled to a mid-pack finish. Pretty uneventful despite the hail storm – mostly well maintained gravel road.”*  . This perspective (from ~2020) suggests SBT was easier for him. But remember SBT’s difficulty ramped up recently with course changes.
	•	u/basketballdairy on acclimation: *“Embrace riding at altitude when you can find it. I’m from Texas (sea level) but I was riding 120-170 mile weeks leading up in heat. People cracked towards the end [at SBT] but I was fine. Altitude will sap some power, but strong training and hydration can overcome it.”* . He also noted *“the south route is easier than north”* in Unbound context which isn’t relevant here, but the point is training in heat/humidity might actually help for altitude events (some studies show heat acclimation can give slight altitude benefits).
	•	r/Velo thread: “Is SBT harder than Leadville?” – Mixed answers. *“Different hard: SBT you can draft and it’s lower altitude, but it’s longer (in time ~7-10h vs Leadville winners ~6.5h). Leadville has insane altitude and MTB tech.”* Many thought SBT is tough but not as brutal as Leadville or Unbound in general. But if you’re not altitude-ready, SBT can absolutely crush you with exhaustion and cramps.

**TRAINERROAD FORUM**

The TrainerRoad forum has dedicated threads for SBT each year, often full of racers discussing prep and race analysis:
	•	**2024 SBT Thread Highlights:**
	•	Athletes shared Best Bike Split projections for the Black course. E.g., a 3.5 W/kg rider targeting ~8 hours needed to hold ~200W NP. They discussed how to adjust BBS for altitude: one user manually reduced his FTP in the calculator by ~8% to simulate altitude effect.
	•	Several TR athletes did the “LeadBoat” (Leadville 100 MTB on Saturday, SBT Black on Sunday in 2023). They commented SBT felt surprisingly okay after Leadville because “different bike, different vibe.” But another said by halfway through SBT his legs were gone from Leadville fatigue. So maybe not advisable for mortals, but pros do it.
	•	TR users talked gearing: one said *“I ran a 44T ring with 10-50 cassette – never needed the 50 until Wahooligan, and was glad I had it!”*. Another on 2x had 33x34 low and said it was enough but just barely on steep bits. Consensus on forum matched Reddit: lower gear = better.
	•	Nutrition TR talk: People used ~90g carbs/hr. Because of altitude, some noticed suppressed appetite; one said he struggled to eat solids above 7,000ft (common effect of altitude is reduced appetite). They recommended liquid nutrition if altitude kills your hunger.
	•	Many TR folks arranged meet-ups or commented on the stellar organization: *“CTS had a pre-race shakeout and the expo was great – lots of freebies”*.
	•	A “2025 SBT Predictions” discussion emerged about whether separate pro start might happen (in 2024 they still mass-started everyone; as of that year SBT resisted separate pro waves to keep it mass participation feel).
	•	**Forum Race Reports:**
	•	One TR user (grwoolf) who posted a detailed Unbound report also did SBT. He said Unbound was harder due to heat/mud, but SBT’s altitude made it sneaky: *“I didn’t feel destroyed after, but my power was down all day and I couldn’t react to attacks like normal.”* He finished around 8:45 (goal 8:30) and attributed the 15 min slow partly to altitude and partly to hail forcing a cautious descent.
	•	Another TR user had power data: he averaged 75% of sea-level FTP for the race and that matched his planned “altitude-adjusted FTP”. That got him in the top 25%. He emphasized using heart rate too – “my HR was ~10 bpm higher for same watts compared to home.”
	•	**Altitude Discussion on TR:** They referenced the same Bassett equation from Fascat: *“8,000ft ~12% drop in power (acclimated)”*. TR coaches advised adjusting pacing accordingly. One coach said: *“Treat 90% of your FTP as your ‘temporary FTP’ for pacing SBT if you’re unacclimated.”* That aligned with what many did.
	•	**Equipment on TR:** People tended to run slightly bigger tires than at Unbound. E.g., one said *“I used 38mm at Unbound but went 42mm for SBT – the gravel’s easier but I wanted comfort on long descents”*. Others with 35mm questioned if enough – many TR responses said 35 could work (some locals even ride 32mm in dry conditions), but you risk more flats. The safe bet 40mm+ was echoed.
	•	**Steamboat Logistics on TR:** Folks asked about lodging – some mentioned that Steamboat lodging is pricey (it’s a resort town). Suggestions included staying in nearby towns like Craig or Kremmling to save money (45-60 min drive), but most prefer to be in Steamboat for morning convenience and events. A TR user said he camped at Steamboat Lake State Park (30 min away) – beautiful but cold night and tough to wake up 4am and drive.
	•	Many recommended booking lodging when you register (if you get in lottery in Nov, immediately book cancellable lodging – prices only go up).
	•	Restaurants: TR folks noted Steamboat has great food (it’s a tourist town). Post-race, there’s a party with food but also the town is full of cyclists celebrating in breweries (like Mountain Tap or Mahogany Ridge).

In sum, TR forum advice boiled down to: **train big for the big climbs, get there early if you can, have a smart fueling/hydration plan for high altitude, and gear your bike appropriately**.

**YOUTUBE RACE REPORTS**

A few specific YouTube videos give insight into SBT GRVL:
	•	**SBT GRVL Official Highlight Videos:** These show the mass start with 3000 riders rolling out of downtown Steamboat (quite a sight), drone shots of pacelines on gravel, and finish line smiles. 2022 highlight: shows sun, then dark clouds, then riders finishing with mud-speckled faces from rain. The commentary noted “tackier conditions” after rain improved times for some.
	•	**Payson McElveen 2021 SBT video:** Payson (pro) had footage of the new “bacon and beer” station – literally volunteers handing bacon strips and cans of beer atop one climb. It encapsulates the fun culture SBT fosters. He skipped the beer (racing!), but some age-groupers actually partake. That video also showed him riding in lead group – you see how fast the gravel descents are (he’s ripping at 35+ mph on hardpack). He nearly slides out on one off-camber turn – a reminder even pros have to be careful on champagne gravel marbles.
	•	**Sarah Sturm’s 2023 recap (video interview):** She talked about trying to get in a women’s group in the mass start: *“We had about 8 of us women working together after a while, which was awesome. The mass start makes it tricky, but we essentially formed our own race within it.”* This highlights the dynamic – women pros sometimes can’t see competitors if mixed in field, but in 2023 they grouped up. She mentioned altitude: being CO native it helped her surge late.
	•	**EF Gone Racing: LeadBoat 2021:** Follows EF pro Lachlan Morton doing Leadville and SBT back-to-back. In SBT segment, Lachlan is clearly tired but enjoying the vibe: *“This is like a gravel party out here – everyone’s cheering, it’s chill.”* He still got top 10. The film shows him soft-pedaling climbs he’d normally hammer – evidence of managing fatigue and altitude.
	•	**Cinch Cycling (Tom Danielson) vlogs:** Tom (ex-pro) coaches gravel athletes. In his 2022 SBT video, he followed his wife who was racing. They highlighted preparation – they did an “altitude camp” at 9k ft for two weeks prior. On race day, she had power targets set ~10% lower than sea level and nailed them to podium in her age group. It was very analytical: he stressed **not chasing people on first climb** – better to stick to your power and reel them in later when they crack from altitude.
	•	**Local Steamboat rider videos:** Some amateurs strapped GoPros – these show the **terrain transitions** nicely: e.g., one guy filming from the back of the pack – starting on pavement in town with police escort, then hitting gravel and dust clouds rise, then quiet open range with cattle grid “clang” sounds. The climbs are seen with long lines of riders slogging, and some walking on Wahooligan. The hailstorm 2022 video by a rider is wild – you see white hail covering the road like snow for a short stretch and riders laughing incredulously.
	•	**Podcast “Groadio” SBT Preview (2024):** They discussed the new route tougher segments. Key quote: *“Don’t let the champagne gravel hype fool you; this year they’ve thrown in some moon-dust and sand traps. Still, it’s predominantly fast. Tire choice might lean a bit knobbier if it’s dry.”* They also mentioned how **Steamboat’s event atmosphere** is like a “gravel family reunion” – something echoed by others.

From video/comments, one often hears **“beautiful”** and **“brutal”** in the same breath about SBT. Beautiful scenery, brutal altitude.

**RACE REPORTS & BLOGS**

Many blogs and race reports provide detail:
	•	**“Race the Rockies: My SBT GRVL Black report” by a sea-level athlete (2021):** He details:
	•	Went out with the lead of his wave, felt good first 2 hours, then on a long climb at 7,500’ suddenly heart rate spiked and power dropped – classic altitude bonk. He had to back way off and even stopped to catch breath. After that, he kept it slower and recovered enough to finish around 10 hours.
	•	He said he learned to “respect the altitude and climbs – I underestimated how cumulative the elevation gain would be.” The total 10k ft climbing was mostly in large chunks vs constant rollers, so it hit him in segments.
	•	Praised the aid stations: volunteers were quick to fill bottles, they had even pickle juice (for cramps) and Coca-Cola which revived him late.
	•	Noted wildlife: saw a black bear far off in a meadow and some deer – a perk of Colorado riding.
	•	“The last climb up Cow Creek was mentally punishing – I was alone, tired, and it felt like it never ended.” He wished he’d pre-ridden that section to know what to expect.
	•	“Crossing that finish under the banner on Yampa Street was overwhelming – they handed me a cold local beer, which I normally don’t drink right after, but it tasted like victory.”
	•	**Team USA (Velonews) report 2022:** Emphasized how many WorldTour road pros were doing SBT (it’s become a big gravel race for ex-pros). They pointed out that the top men finished ~6 hours 30 minutes in 2022 (due to fast conditions), which was far faster than expected for 142 miles – showing how non-technical + drafting can make it super fast. Contrasting Unbound’s ~10-hour winning times, SBT is a shorter race time for the winners. But mid/back-pack times are more like 8-12 hours.
	•	**Local News (Steamboat Pilot):** They often highlight local winners of age groups or any issues. In 2023 they mentioned only 1 rider was hospitalized (for dehydration) and overall finishing rate was ~95% – pretty high since weather was good. So SBT tends to see most finish (it’s challenging but manageable for many).
	•	**Blogs on Altitude for SBT:** Some coaches wrote pieces like “Preparing for SBT GRVL – acclimation and pacing.” They basically say what we’ve covered: try to simulate altitude (hypoxic training) if possible, or arrive early; dial down power goals; incorporate long climbs in training (if you live in flatland, maybe do repeats on bridges or use indoor trainer in ERG low cadence to simulate climbing muscle endurance).
	•	**Funny blog tidbit:** One rider said he wished he’d “brought a flask for the bacon hill” as a joke – because on Chamois Butt’r Hill, spectators offered whiskey shots. He actually took one and said it oddly calmed his nerves for the final miles! Not recommended, but that’s the kind of fun you can have if you’re not too serious about your time.
	•	**Lodging/Logistics blogs:** A few travel blogs mention that Steamboat lodging is expensive (peak summer tourism). Many participants combine it with a family vacation – kids can fish or tube the Yampa river while parent races, etc. Steamboat’s a destination, so some bring family and stay a week. The town supports that with events (they had a “SBT Family 1-mile ride” for kids in 2023 and other activities).

One repeated logistic piece: **book dinner reservations** for Saturday post-race if you have family – restaurants fill up with hungry gravelers. Or use the provided post-race meal (2024 had a meal ticket for a BBQ plate at the finish expo).

**MEDIA COVERAGE**

SBT GRVL garners significant media attention now:
	•	**CyclingTips / Escape:** Did previews and tech coverage. They noted riders often treat SBT as a “**Gravel Worlds tune-up**” since it’s about a month before UCI Gravel Worlds. Also tech – many pros used slightly lighter setups at SBT vs Unbound (like 35-40mm tires instead of 45, since terrain is smoother).
	•	**VeloNews (Outside):** The 2024 preview by Betsy Welch we cited   – it detailed course changes. Post-race they interviewed winners: e.g. 2024 male winner Keegan Swenson said he attacked on Mystic climb and solo’d, remarking that his high-altitude upbringing (Park City) was an advantage. Women’s winner Sofia Gomez Villafañe said mass start was chaotic but she found a strong group of women to work with which helped.
	•	**CyclingNews:** Focused on the “Quadrupel Crown series” (BWR + SBT + others) which SBT is part of. They also covered the rancher controversy in 2024: *“One of the largest gravel races faces local opposition”*. That article (Colorado Sun colab) we touched on: some quotes from ranchers complaining riders “urinated on my fence and spooked my cattle” – organizers strongly apologized and have stricter rules each year to avoid that.
	•	**Podcasts:** Gravel Ride Podcast and others had Amy Charity (SBT founder) on, discussing how they aim to make SBT inclusive – e.g. equal spots for men and women lottery (they reserve 50% of entries for women to boost female participation – it worked, SBT is close to 1:1 gender ratio in shorter courses now). They also talked about the **Steamboat community** benefiting ($4.5M economic impact) but balancing ranch life – interesting behind-the-scenes.
	•	**Bicycling.com:** Did a piece like “10 Tips for SBT GRVL” around 2021 – mainly generic advice (practice descending gravel, bring layers, don’t forget sunscreen at altitude, watch out for wildlife, etc.). Good point: *“Afternoon storms are common; if you hear thunder, don’t be the tallest object on an exposed road – keep moving but be cautious if lightning is near.”* There are some open high plateau sections where you are relatively exposed (though usually some trees or lines of sight to houses to duck if needed).
	•	**Post-Race Stats:** Media noted DNF rates are low at SBT relative to Unbound or Leadville – often >90% finish. That’s attributed to milder weather, lots of aid, and perhaps riders selecting courses that suit them (i.e. if unsure, doing Blue 100mi instead of Black 142mi). In 2023, of ~900 on Black, ~830 finished (~92%). Blue had similar finisher rate. So SBT is tough but doable for most who attempt.

All coverage emphasizes SBT as a **premier gravel event** – it’s sometimes nicknamed “Gravel Worlds” (unofficially) because of the deep pro field and quality organization.

**RESULTS & DNF DATA**

**Winners & Times:**
	•	*2024:* **Keegan Swenson** won men’s Black (for the second time) in ~6h 13m (125 miles) – an astonishing ~20.1 mph average . He soloed last ~30 miles. **Sofia Gomez Villafañe** won women’s in ~6h 52m. These times reflect fast conditions and high-level field (Swenson is arguably world’s top gravel racer).
	•	*2023:* **Keegan Swenson** also won (beating Petr Vakoc in a sprint) around 6h 50m for 142 miles. **Sofia Villafañe** won women ~7h 30m. That year had some headwind and route was longer, so slower than 2024.
	•	*2022:* **Ian Boswell** won men ~6h 37m; **Lauren De Crescenzo** women ~7h 16m. (Boswell had lost to Alexey Vermeulen in sprint in 2021, came back to win 2022).
	•	*2021:* **Pete Stetina** won ~6h 39m (he out-sprinted Boswell and Howes). **Lauren De Crescenzo** women ~7h 27m. That was the original 142mi course with 10000’ climbing.
	•	In general, men’s winners ~6.2-6.8 hours, women ~7-7.5 hours historically on Black. That’s significantly faster (in terms of time) than Unbound’s 10+ hours.

**Field Breakdown & DNF:**
	•	Black Course typically sees the most DNFs simply because it’s longest. But even then, as noted, ~90% finish. Blue (100 mi) sees very high finish rates (~95+%). Because many Blue riders might be local amateurs or those who opted out of Black if not ready.
	•	If thunderstorms hit, some may abandon, but support is good and cutoffs generous, so most continue unless lightning directly overhead.
	•	In 2022, a handful of riders abandoned during the hail (a few with hypothermia or hail injuries), but out of ~2800 riders total, only ~100 DNFs across all courses (<4%).
	•	Notable stat: The **average finish time** for Black is around 9-10 hours for men, 10-11 hours for women (mid-pack). For Blue 100, average maybe ~6-7h. Red 60, average ~4h. So many “finishers” are done by mid-afternoon and get to enjoy finish festival, whereas Black back-of-pack finishes by 5-6pm.
	•	No age group is disproportionately DNF – perhaps some older riders drop to shorter routes (which SBT encourages – they allow you to switch course if needed, with notice).
	•	SBT also has a **“Doubler” category** for those who did Leadville 100 MTB the day before – in 2023 about 50 people attempted it (“LeadBoat”). Most of those finished SBT too (some slowly). They get special recognition. It’s insane but doable if well-trained.

**Conclusion on results:** SBT results highlight it as a **race of speed and attrition by elevation** rather than attrition by DNFs. It’s become one where large packs finish (e.g., in 2024 the top 20 men all under 6h30, practically a road race outcome). But for amateur riders, finishing Black under the 11-hour mark is an achievement. Many set that as goal or opt for Blue if not up for it.

Because DNF rates are low, SBT’s challenge is more about how deep into the field you can place or how well you manage personal goals (like not stopping too long, climbing strong, etc.) instead of just surviving like Unbound.

**Podium diversity:** Typically a lot of ex-pro roadies in top 10. But also dedicated gravel specialists. Age group podiums vary – plenty of local Colorado riders often win age groups (home altitude advantage).

**Random Data:** In 2023, about 48 states and 20+ countries were represented. They purposely do parity initiatives (50% women lottery, etc.), so female participation was ~30% in 2023 and rising.

**Series Points:** SBT is part of the Life Time Grand Prix and Quadrupel Crown, so results also feed into those series. That’s partly why so many top pros target it – prize money and series points.

**Finish-line vibe:** The finish is on a closed-off main street in Steamboat, with announcers calling in riders (“Here comes John Doe from Texas finishing the Black course in under 10 hours!”). Often riders hang around the finish to cheer others, adding to high finishing rate – they make it such a party that people push to finish for the celebration.

**SUFFERING ZONES**

Even in the scenic splendor of SBT, there are well-known “oh no” segments where riders really suffer:
	•	**Wahooligan Hill (Mile ~23 Black / ~15 Blue):** Early but brutal. Many describe hitting HR max here. *“I was seeing stars at the top of that damn Wahooligan climb,”* said one rider. At 8,200’ with 15% pitches, this is a suffer-fest. It also splits the field: you can blow up here and struggle rest of day if not careful. Those who went too hard suffer altitude headaches after.
	•	**Trident of Climbs (mid-race Black):** There’s typically a trio of significant climbs between miles 50-80 (e.g., Three Forks, Skull Creek, etc.). Individually not monstrous, but back-to-back at altitude they cumulatively hurt. *“By the third long climb I had the low-oxygen delirium,”* one said. On these climbs, you often see riders slumped over handlebars at aid stations right after, trying to catch breath.
	•	**Heat on Exposed Valleys (midday):** The stretch around miles 60-70 (the long rolling roads toward Hayden) runs through exposed ranch land with no shade. If it’s sunny and 85°F, riders broil here with the sun reflecting off light-colored gravel. Many report slight sunburn or feeling dizzy from the combination of altitude + heat around this point. It’s not a specific hill, but a *“suffer zone”* of 15-20 miles where nothing is technical but you’re just grinding along fighting the elements and your own fatigue.
	•	**The “Wall” on Corkscrew (Mile ~95):** Chamois Butt’r Hill has a really steep kicker right at the top, 18-20% briefly. After 90+ miles, a lot of people cramp here. Spectators often physically push riders (allowed? not officially, but some give a gentle push) up that last bit. *“I cramped both hamstrings on that stupid steep bit, had to paperboy to avoid falling over,”* one rider recounted. Definitely a suffering snapshot: lots of grimaces and maybe some choice curse words as riders crest that with bacon hanging out of their mouth.
	•	**Cow Creek “Death March” (Mile 105-120):** Universally described as the toughest mental challenge. *“15 miles of false flat that feels like 30,”* said the race director , and riders agree. By this point, many are alone or in very small groups. The road is rough enough to rattle already tired bodies. It’s net uphill – you keep thinking *“Surely we descend soon?”* but no, it’s mostly up. The suffer comes from deep fatigue, dwindling oxygen, and anticipation of finishing while the course just drags on. Some refer to this section as the “**soul crusher**.” If you see someone on the side of the road stretching or just sitting on a rock, it’s likely in this segment, trying to gather themselves for the final push.
	•	**Double Peak… oh wait, wrong race.** But SBT’s final 5 miles from top of Cow Creek into Steamboat can still be painful: it’s pavement (yay), but by then any small incline hurts. People have emptied the tank to get up Cow Creek and now must muster a *sprint-ish* finish on pavement. That’s where it fully hits that you’ve been oxygen-deprived for hours – the simplest acceleration might spike your HR. But at least the end is near, which helps.
	•	**Cramps at Altitude:** A unique suffering anecdote: many riders who never cramp at sea level got cramps at SBT. Possibly due to dehydration + altitude. So lots of riders in later aid stations could be seen gobbling pickle juice or electrolyte pills. The suffering of trying to pedal through a calf cramp on a climb at 8,000’ – not fun.
	•	**Thunderstorm Havoc (if applicable):** If storms hit while you’re on course, that can become a suffer zone too. In 2022, riders caught in hail at mile ~80 described it as *“painful needles on my back… roads turned to slippery mud, I was frozen.”* For ~15-30 minutes, those folks suffered mightily until it passed. Then paradoxically, some said they overheated once sun came back out because they’d put on a rain jacket and now had to stop to remove layers. Mountain weather can toy with you.

Overall, SBT’s suffering is more about **sustained climbing at high effort** (and the altitude strain) rather than extreme terrain or weather. The hardest moments are on climbs like Wahooligan and Corkscrew where you’re redlined and gasping for thin air, and in the long grind sections where mental fatigue sets in.

Riders often say the **“low point”** came around 3/4 through the race (for Black course maybe mile 90-100) – you’ve been out there maybe 6-7 hours, still have climbs left, legs are cooked, and the finish feels far. But then you crest the last hill and can smell the barn, adrenaline returns.

One quote from a 2021 finisher sums it: *“I remember thinking around mile 100, ‘Why do I do this to myself?’ Then at mile 125 I thought, ‘Can’t wait to do it again next year.’”*

**EQUIPMENT CONSENSUS (especially gearing)**

**Bike Type:** Gravel bike, for sure. Some locals on forums joked you could do SBT on a road bike with 32c tires on dry years – but with new rough sections, a true gravel setup is better. No suspension required (some ran Redshift stems or Lauf fork, but not necessary). A lightweight gravel rig (carbon everything) is popular since climbing is significant.

**Tires:** As noted, **~40mm tubeless** is the sweet spot. Most common tires seen:
	•	Specialized Pathfinder Pro 2Bliss 42mm (very popular, fast rolling – winners have used these).
	•	Donnelly MSO or EMP 40mm.
	•	Maxxis Rambler 40mm or Maxxis Receptor 40 (semi-slick).
	•	Schwalbe G-One R or RS in 45mm (some went wider for comfort).
	•	Pirelli Gravel H (Hardpack) 40mm (the Nick Leeper report used 35c – he said he’d go 38c next time)  .

In 2024, the organizers themselves recommended not below 40mm due to loose conditions . So that’s a shift toward slightly beefier. But still, tread doesn’t need to be aggressive: file tread or small knobs suffice for dry conditions. If it’s wet/muddy, maybe a medium knob (but mud usually isn’t deep there, just slippery if rain).

**Pressures:** Typically 30-45 psi depending on rider/tire. Because surfaces are smoother, some run a bit higher than in chunky gravel to avoid tire squirm. E.g. a 160 lb rider might do 32 psi front / 35 rear on 40c. Another heavier rider said 38/40 psi worked for him with no flats. Those on 45mm might go mid-to upper-20s psi. Pinch flats aren’t too common as rocks aren’t super jagged, but there are washboards that can cause impact.

**Gearing (crucial!):**
	•	Most **pro men** run 1x (e.g. 44T ring with 10-44 or 10-50 cassette). But they also can muscle up climbs at low cadence. For mortals, a sub-1:1 ratio is wise.
	•	Many amateurs on 2x ran 50/34 with 11-34 cassette – some found 34x34 just barely enough. Others had GRX 48/31 with 11-34 or 11-36, giving 31x36 (~0.86) which was comfortable.
	•	A common upgrade is a WolfTooth roadlink and an 11-40 or 11-42 cassette on a 2x, to use 34x40 (~0.85 ratio). People very happy with that on steep bits.
	•	On 1x, common setups: 40T chainring with 10-50 (0.80 ratio), 42T with 10-52 (0.81). A rider in 50s said he ran 38T ring with 10-42 (1:1 lowest) and regretted not having a 46 cassette – he had to zigzag on Wahooligan.
	•	The **steepest sustained grade** is around 10-12%, but short pitches hit ~20%. At altitude and on gravel, you really want to spin if possible rather than mash. So gearing is “as low as you can without resorting to MTB double.” (Though some just slap an MTB derailleur and cassette which is fine).
	•	Another angle: Because there are also long descents and flat valley pacelines, having a decent top-end is good (you’ll spin out 40x10 at ~30+ mph). But better to spin-out for a minute than grind all day. Many prefer having the easy gear.
	•	The consensus from Reddit/TR: **err on the side of easier gearing.** No one complains about having a bailout gear if they don’t need it; plenty complain if they needed it and didn’t have it.

**Drivetrain Type:** GRX 2x is prevalent for full range. But lots of SRAM 1x mullet setups too (Eagle cassette). Electronic shifting helps on those long climbs to fine-tune cadence.

**Brakes:** Discs (some long descents might overheat rims if rim brakes – and not many bikes under 40c tires anyway).

**Tech for Altitude:** Some riders put a little *“altitude cheat sheet”* on their bike computer – e.g. target HR zones or “don’t exceed X watts on climbs.” Using data smartly can keep you out of the red.
	•	A few use Garmin’s ClimbPro feature: by loading course, they can see how far to top of each climb – helps mentally and to pace. SBT’s course profiles are usually posted, so good to have.

**Flat Kit:** Bring at least 1-2 tubes (goathead thorns can cause punctures, especially near hay fields). Many also carry a plug kit (the small punctures often seal with Stans + plug easily in these gravel roads).
	•	CO2 works but at altitude it’s less effective (the gas volume is the same, but it cools more/fills slightly less at lower atmospheric pressure – minor but worth noting). A pump is recommended as backup.

**Clothing & Accessories:**
	•	Likely a light jacket or vest for the cold morning start, stuffed in pocket by mid-morning. Many wore arm warmers, which can be rolled down or removed after sun comes up.
	•	Sunscreen, lip balm (air is dry, lips chap easily).
	•	Possibly a hydration pack: debated. Many did with bottles only due to frequent aid (and cooler early temps), but some mid/backpackers prefer a small Camelbak to sip continuously and have extra storage for gels/jacket. It’s personal preference. Since speeds are high, some avoid packs to reduce weight and aero drag; others value the convenience. In 2024 SBT had some “unmanned water stations” too just in case, due to heat.
	•	Sunglasses (critical, high UV and dust).
	•	A bandana or neck gaiter not for cold, but to dip in stream or put ice in at aids if hot (there are occasional creeks next to course – a few folks dunked their caps in cold creek water mid-race).
	•	If storms likely: a pocketable rain jacket (so-called “pro tip”: if hail is forecast, maybe bring a **cap or buff** to protect head/ears – hail hurts).

**Notable equipment from Pros 2023:** Many ran **700x40 semi-slicks**, Aero-ish gravel bikes (Specialized Diverge, Canyon Grail, etc). **Keegan Swenson** used Maxxis Ramblers 40c EXO, 1x SRAM, etc. He had a 44x10-50. Villafañe used 2x GRX with likely 48/31 and 11-34. She had 38c Specialized Pathfinder (yes the women’s winner used only 38c – shows course was not super rough).

One fun note: Some riders put a little bell on their bike – not needed in SBT as much as say BWR, but with mass start sometimes coming up on slower people in other courses on shared segments, a friendly bell ring is nice to pass. Not common, but a few did.

**Bottom line equipment advice:**

“Ride the bike you’re comfortable on for long distances, with tires that can handle loose gravel. Gear it low, keep it light, and make sure your brakes and sealant are fresh for those big descents and possible goatheads.”

**LOGISTICS**

Steamboat Springs is a mountain resort town, so logistics differ from Emporia:

**Travel:**
	•	**Nearest Airport:** Hayden (HDN) Yampa Valley Regional – 25 miles (has some direct flights from Denver, Dallas, etc. in summer). Or Denver International (DEN) ~3.5 hour drive. Many fly to Denver and rent car or share shuttle to Steamboat.
	•	Some also drive from Salt Lake City (~6 hours) or other regional cities.

**Lodging:**
	•	**Cost:** Expensive. Peak summer rates for hotels easily $250-400/night. Condos or Airbnb can be more cost-effective especially if splitting with others.
	•	**Where:** Downtown Steamboat (near start/finish), or Mountain Village (ski resort area ~3 miles away) – race organizes shuttles from resort to start. Some stayed in cheaper motels in Craig (45 min west) or Kremmling (1 hr south) but then you have early drive.
	•	**Camping:** Yes, several campgrounds around (Steamboat KOA, etc.). The event offered limited camping spots via registration in 2021-22, not sure about latest. Many stealth camp on Forest land too. But remember nights can be cold (upper 30s°F sometimes).
	•	**Book Early:** Lodging in Steamboat sells out fast once lottery results announced (Nov). People often book backup lodging before lottery just in case, since cancellations are allowed up to a certain date. Locals sometimes rent out rooms privately too.

**Race Check-In & Expo:**
	•	Located typically at Howelsen Hill or Rodeo Grounds in town (2023 expo was at Rodeo Grounds Thurs-Fri). Plenty of parking there.
	•	Packet pickup Friday with an evening welcome party. There was also a **pre-race riders meeting** in 2019 but not sure if still done – most info in guide.
	•	On-site registration pick-up often has a waiver line, then swag bag pickup (SBT gives nice swag: previous years a trucker hat, neck gaiter, etc. plus samples).
	•	**Expo:** Mid-sized – major gravel brands show up (Canyon had demo bikes, Shimano neutral service, etc.). It’s open to public and often integrated with downtown events (e.g. a Friday night concert or film fest at the Chief Theater).
	•	**Rider Events:** There’s a **Shakeout Ride** Friday morning or Thurs, usually ~20 miles easy, open to all, often led by pros or sponsors. Also panels (e.g. “Gravel pros Q&A”) and a film festival on gravel adventures.
	•	**Pre-race Dinner:** They often partner with a local restaurant for a pasta feed or have an outdoor group dinner. Not mandatory but nice communal vibe.

**Support Crew:** Unlike Unbound, outside support is largely not needed – aid stations suffice and outside assistance is generally not allowed except at designated zones. 2026 will allow team support at one aid for elites , but amateurs rely on official stations. The course often comes near roads accessible to spectators – so personal support could be arranged but not officially. Most don’t have personal crew; families can drive to spectate at points like Oak Creek or top of Corkscrew, etc.

**Start Line:** Usually downtown on Lincoln Ave or Yampa Street around 6:30 or 7:00AM Sunday. They do waves by distance: e.g. Black off at 6:30, Blue at 7:00, Red at 7:30, Green at 8:00 (staggered so finishers converge closer together). In 2024, they moved race to Sunday (was Sunday historically too) so locals could enjoy normal Saturday farmers market then race day Sunday – something about town schedule.
	•	Mass start for each course with maybe call-ups for pros in front. The start is not as chaotic as Unbound because roads are wide and they have a neutral rollout a few miles.
	•	Bag Drop: They allow drop bags to certain aid stations (not sure if for everyone or just special categories). But since aids are frequent, not hugely needed to have drop bags – except maybe leaving a rain jacket at an aid in case, or personal nutrition if you’re picky.

**Course Markings & Navigation:** SBT marks the course with color-coded signs (Black arrows for Black course, etc.). It’s well-marked, one of their prides (volunteers at all major turns). Many still load the GPS route though. Notably, SBT is almost entirely on public roads, so no navigation trickiness like finding unmarked farm paths (unlike BWR). People rarely get lost.
	•	There are timing mats at certain points to ensure no course-cutting (plus they probably use GPS tracking for pro field).

**Cutoffs & Sag:** If behind pace, volunteers may divert you to shorter route (common if someone on Black can’t make a time, they might re-route to Blue course finish at mile ~100). They announce cutoff times in guide (e.g. “Must reach Aid 3 by 1:30pm to continue on Black, otherwise directed to finish via Blue course.”). Sag wagons sweep behind last riders. Historically, very few don’t finish, but sag did pick up some in thunderstorm year who decided to abandon.

**Finish Festival:** At Steamboat’s Little Toots Park or downtown block – typical beer garden, food vendors, music. In 2023 they gave finishers a meal ticket for local BBQ and a free beer from Odell Brewing (sponsor). Families hang out on grass while kids play – quite family-friendly. Awards late afternoon for overall and age groups.
	•	One logistic: Steamboat has *hot springs*! Some riders bring family to Old Town Hot Springs (right in town) next day for recovery soak – a perk.

**Local Culture:** Steamboat embraces cycling (it’s a Bike Town USA). But with that rancher friction, riders are urged to be extra courteous on roads, not litter (organizers enforce littering = DQ).
	•	There’s a “Bike Path Etiquette” – parts of course use a city bike path to get to finish, where you must be mindful of public. They brief riders to yield to any pedestrians etc.
	•	The event directly donates to local trail and community funds to keep goodwill.

**Medical & Safety:** They have medics at aid stations and roaming. Altitude sickness severe cases are rare, but they watch for dehydration and crashes. In 2021 one rider crashed on a descent and broke collarbone; was evac’d promptly.

**COVID note:** 2020 cancelled, 2021 was first big return event in CO; they had some measures but now normal operations.

**Memorabilia:** Finisher award is usually a sweet trucker cap or a bolo tie (2022 gave bolo ties to Black finishers). They sell merch at expo (jerseys, etc. in SBT neon green theme).

**Note on combining w/ Leadville:** Some do both (LeadBoat). SBT organizers coordinate with Leadville so that LeadBoat folks have a special pickup and late start option if needed (they gave LeadBoat racers a separate check-in line on Saturday because they arrive from Leadville awards late). Also a LeadBoat after-party Monday with special awards. Logistically, LeadBoat racers must travel ~2.5 hrs from Leadville finish to Steamboat Saturday evening – not easy, but they usually get police escort for them.

**Weather backups:** If severe weather (lightning, hail) midday, they have safe zones (like volunteer fire stations on route) to shelter riders if needed. But hasn’t been used yet.

**After the Race:** Many stick around Monday for relaxed “hangover” ride or just enjoying Steamboat (biking trails, lakes, etc.). Some race-related events like awards brunch took place Monday in early years for series, but mostly it’s Sunday evening awards then done.

**Summary:** Logistics are relatively straightforward due to good support and an outdoorsy host town:

Arrive a few days early (if possible), stay near town, enjoy the pre-race activities, race with full service support, then soak in a hot spring and a beer after finishing, hopefully with a big finisher smile.

**“WHAT I WISH I KNEW” QUOTES**

Seasoned SBT GRVL riders often share hindsight tips:
	•	**Altitude Reality:** *“I wish I’d believed people about the altitude. It snuck up on me. Next time, I’d arrive earlier or pace easier. Altitude will make 300W feel like 330W – don’t chase numbers.”* This reflects many first-timers’ experience of underestimating high elevation effects.
	•	**Use the Aid Stations Fully:** *“I barely stopped at the first aid and paid for it later. In retrospect, taking an extra minute to eat and drink at each aid is worth it. The time lost is nothing compared to bonking or cramping.”* – Lots of riders echo that SBT’s plentiful aid is an asset; skipping them to save 2-3 minutes can backfire.
	•	**Bring Rain Jacket in Jersey (even if forecast sunny):** *“Colorado weather flips fast. I got pelted by hail in a summer kit – miserable. I’ll never ride in the Rockies without a packable jacket stashed, forecast be damned.”* A regret from 2022 hail victims.
	•	**Lower Gear & Wider Tire:** *“After grinding up steep grades at 6 mph and sliding on descents, I realized: more gears, more rubber. I came from roadie background with 35mm and 1:1 gear – survived but would’ve been happier with 40mm and sub-1:1.”* Many road-turned-gravel riders learn this after SBT.
	•	**Pre-ride Key Sections (if local or arrive early):** *“I wish I had pre-driven or pre-ridden Cow Creek. Not knowing how long it was made it mentally tougher. Locals knew exactly what was left and paced themselves. Knowledge is power out there.”* Indeed, recon helps; but if not possible, at least study the course profile intimately.
	•	**Acclimate Sleep:** *“Didn’t know altitude would mess with my sleep. I only got 3 hours the night before because my heart was racing at bedtime (common at altitude). Next time I’ll use earplugs, calming tea, anything to get more sleep.”* A tip from a sea-level athlete – altitude insomnia is real.
	•	**Don’t Fear the Downhills:** *“I over-braked on the gravel descents, lost time and confidence. Later I realized they were in better shape than I thought. I wish I’d practiced descending on loose gravel more – the locals bombed past me.”* Being comfortable on sketchy surfaces can be a difference-maker.
	•	**Sun Protection:** *“Colorado sun gave me raccoon eyes tan like never before. Should’ve reapplied sunscreen at mid-race. And maybe worn a brim under helmet to protect face more.”* Several mentioned underestimating the UV due to moderate temps.
	•	**Eat Early & Often (especially at altitude):** *“My stomach shut down at altitude late in the race. I should have front-loaded calories more in first half when I could still digest well.”* A common strategy is eat more in first 2-3 hours, as appetite may wane later.
	•	**Stay in Steamboat longer:** *“I rushed out Sunday night. Wish I stayed to enjoy the post-race and the town on Monday. The gravel community was hanging out at the river and breweries – FOMO.”* Many do treat it as a runcation – sticking around to decompress would be nice if one’s schedule allows.
	•	**Training specificity:** *“Those 10-min TrainerRoad intervals didn’t prepare me for a 40-min climb at 8000ft. Next time, I’ll do longer threshold climbs, maybe on a trainer with lower oxygen (or simulated by wearing mask), to mimic the sustained effort.”* Some realized their training lacked long efforts or altitude simulation.
	•	**Tire Inserts?** *“I flatted on a sharp rock in a corner. With inserts I might’ve saved it. Given the high speeds, I think I’ll use CushCore inserts next time for peace of mind. Weight penalty is small.”* Not universal, but a few are adding inserts to be able to run lower pressure and protect against pinch flats in rocky bits.
	•	**Enjoy the Scenery (but not too much):** *“I was so focused on watts that I barely looked up. Steamboat’s gorgeous! Next time I’ll take a second on a climb crest to soak in the view – that’s why we gravel ride, right?”* That sentiment underscores remembering to have fun – something many realize after chasing performance too hard.

Finally, a veteran said:

*“I wish I knew that feeling crappy halfway doesn’t mean your race is over. At SBT, you can rally. I felt awful at mile 80, but after some Coke and gummy bears at aid, I actually felt amazing at mile 100 and finished strong. Don’t give up when you hit a low – it can turn around.”*

That’s golden advice for any long endurance event, and certainly true at SBT GRVL.
