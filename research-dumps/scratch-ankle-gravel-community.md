# SCRATCH ANKLE GRAVEL — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Location:** The race starts at Bear Lake Road in Milton, Florida, in the Florida Panhandle. The course runs through **Blackwater River State Forest** and **Conecuh National Forest**, offering one of the Southeast's most distinctive gravel settings. The terrain features rolling short steep hills and moderate sustained climbs through pine flatwoods and longleaf pine forest. (scratchanklegravel.com)

**Elevation:** The course sits near sea level in the Florida Panhandle, with elevation changes coming from the rolling hill terrain characteristic of the region's sand hills. The moderate terrain profile makes the event accessible while still providing challenge through accumulated climbing over longer distances.

**Distance Options:** The event offers multiple distance options including routes of approximately 20, 60, 100, and 200 miles, with staggered start times throughout the morning. The XL distance starts at 7:30 AM, the Large at 9:00 AM, and the Medium at 10:00 AM, with an overall start at 7:00 AM. (granfondoguide.com)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

No participant-specific equipment recommendations are available from race reports. The gravel roads through Blackwater River State Forest and Conecuh National Forest are typical southeastern sand-and-clay surfaces. Standard gravel bike setups should work well, though riders should be prepared for potential sandy sections that benefit from wider tires (40mm+) for better flotation.

## Weather Experienced

**March Conditions in Milton, FL:** The race takes place in early to mid-March in the Florida Panhandle. Typical conditions include mild to warm temperatures with the possibility of spring rain. The coastal plain location means humidity can be a factor even in early spring. No specific race-day weather reports are available from past editions.

## Race Strategy & Pacing

No pacing data or strategy reports are available from participants. The multiple distance options (ranging from 20 to 200 miles) accommodate a wide range of abilities. Aid stations are provided along the course with SAG support available, reducing the self-sufficiency demands compared to more remote gravel events.
