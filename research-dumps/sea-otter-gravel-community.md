# SEA OTTER CLASSIC GRAVEL — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Keegan Swenson [ELITE]:** "It was fast, tactical racing all day, and Lookout Ridge was the only place where there was much selection. I knew that was going to be the place to go on the last lap, and that I needed to play my cards right. I gave it everything I had." His effort was so intense that he was seen vomiting post-race.

**Keegan Swenson [ELITE]:** "It's nice to have a little buffer heading into UNBOUND too because that's a crazy, hectic race where anything can happen." (https://www.granfondoguide.com/Contents/IndexFull/8466/batten-and-swenson-triumph-at-sea-otter-classic-gravel-race)

**Steph Hart [COMPETITIVE]:** "Goal number one was to keep the rubber side down, anything else was a bonus." After buying a gravel bike in February and falling off 9 times on her first ride, she signed up for the 90-mile route. She finished 2nd overall in women's field, 1st in 30-39 AG, 61st overall out of 198 riders. (https://www.altovelo.org/race-reports/race-report-sea-otter-classic-gravel-race)

**Steph Hart [COMPETITIVE]:** "After grabbing way too much brake, watching two super sprinkles riders crash, and contemplating why I took a day of PTO and paid $175 to do this race, I finally settled into some flat(ish) gravel where I could collect myself." On the technical challenges of the descent. (https://www.altovelo.org/race-reports/race-report-sea-otter-classic-gravel-race)

**Steph Hart [COMPETITIVE]:** "Within the group, I clearly had the fitness advantage, but managed to get gapped at every sandtrap, loose corner, and single track section- that's gravel newbie life." Describing the tension between fitness and bike handling skills. (https://www.altovelo.org/race-reports/race-report-sea-otter-classic-gravel-race)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**[COMPETITIVE - Steph Hart]:** Assumed neutral bottles would be available and didn't bring a hydration pack—this was a mistake. Only had two bottles for the 90-mile race on a warm day and had to stop at 50 miles to refill, losing about 30 seconds. (https://www.altovelo.org/race-reports/race-report-sea-otter-classic-gravel-race)

**[COMPETITIVE - General observation]:** Braking control is critical—multiple riders noted grabbing "way too much brake" on loose descents. The course features many loose descents and corners that punish road bike handling habits. (https://www.altovelo.org/race-reports/race-report-sea-otter-classic-gravel-race)

## Weather Experienced

**2025 Race:** Described as "a pretty warm day" that contributed to hydration challenges. (https://www.altovelo.org/race-reports/race-report-sea-otter-classic-gravel-race)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**General Course:** 3 laps of 30 miles each = 90 miles total, with 2,700 ft of climbing per lap (8,100 ft total). Course is approximately 70% gravel. (https://www.altovelo.org/race-reports/race-report-sea-otter-classic-gravel-race)

**Start/First Mile:** Race begins with a hard sprint out of the racetrack, followed by half a mile of single track, then a fast but loose 3-mile descent. This opening sequence creates immediate selection. (https://www.altovelo.org/race-reports/race-report-sea-otter-classic-gravel-race)

**Lookout Ridge:** Features a 0.25-mile stretch of technical single track averaging 15.5% grade near the end of each lap. This is described as THE selection point of the race. One rider noted pre-riding this section and crashing during reconnaissance. The technical single track precedes the main Lookout Ridge climb. (https://www.altovelo.org/race-reports/race-report-sea-otter-classic-gravel-race, https://www.granfondoguide.com/Contents/IndexFull/8466/batten-and-swenson-triumph-at-sea-otter-classic-gravel-race)

**Laguna Seca Racetrack Sections:** Each lap loops through the famous racetrack, which is NOT flat—includes two 3-4 minute climbs peaking at 12% grade, plus two descents through gravel pits. These sections are well-suited for spectators but technically challenging. (https://www.altovelo.org/race-reports/race-report-sea-otter-classic-gravel-race)

**Fort Ord National Monument:** The main course area features "rough terrain and rutted paths" with "lots of loose descents/corners" and "sandtraps" that repeatedly gap riders with superior fitness but inferior bike handling. (https://www.granfondoguide.com/Contents/IndexFull/8466/batten-and-swenson-triumph-at-sea-otter-classic-gravel-race, https://www.altovelo.org/race-reports/race-report-sea-otter-classic-gravel-race)

**Technical Challenges:** The course is "not terribly technical" overall but features "a pretty rough climb leading into Lookout Ridge" and numerous sections where road bike handling is insufficient. (https://www.altovelo.org/race-reports/race-report-sea-otter-classic-gravel-race)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**[ELITE - Keegan Swenson]:** Raced tactically in groups for the first two laps, then made his decisive move on Lookout Ridge on the final lap, utilizing the steep slopes to accelerate and open an insurmountable gap. Won in 4:20:25. (https://www.granfondoguide.com/Contents/IndexFull/8466/batten-and-swenson-triumph-at-sea-otter-classic-gravel-race)

**[COMPETITIVE - Steph Hart]:** Consumed 380g carbohydrates over 6 hours via Maurten, shot blocks, and Neversecond gels. Started with 2 bottles and 0g sodium. Finished in approximately 6 hours with 3,900 kJ of work. (https://www.altovelo.org/race-reports/race-report-sea-otter-classic-gravel-race)

**[COMPETITIVE - Steph Hart]:** Strategy of sitting in groups early despite having a fitness advantage, preserving energy while accepting being gapped on technical sections and catching back on climbs. This yo-yo pattern worked until nutrition/hydration issues emerged late in the race. (https://www.altovelo.org/race-reports/race-report-sea-otter-classic-gravel-race)

**Race Dynamics:** The first lap saw early breakaways form quickly. By lap two, riders from earlier start waves (30 and 60-mile races) were being lapped, which created traffic and affected morale for 90-mile riders. By lap three, the course can feel empty as shorter-distance riders finish. (https://www.altovelo.org/race-reports/race-report-sea-otter-classic-gravel-race)

**Start Strategy:** Women's field had a separate start for 60 and 90-mile routes (67 riders total in 2025). Riders went out very hard immediately to establish position before the first single-track section. (https://www.altovelo.org/race-reports/race-report-sea-otter-classic-gravel-race)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Hydration Crisis [COMPETITIVE - Steph Hart]:** Severe adductor cramping at mile 75 (with 15 miles to go) forced a complete stop. Had to physically get off bike and walk off the cramp for approximately 2 minutes. This was attributed to insufficient hydration (only 2 bottles) combined with 3,900 kJ of work on a warm day. Average power plummeted in the final 10 miles. (https://www.altovelo.org/race-reports/race-report-sea-otter-classic-gravel-race)

**Crashes:** Multiple riders observed crashing on the fast, loose opening descent and technical sections. One elite ("super sprinkles") rider crashed on the first descent. Technical single-track sections pose crash risk even during pre-ride reconnaissance. (https://www.altovelo.org/race-reports/race-report-sea-otter-classic-gravel-race)

**Bike Handling:** Road cyclists transitioning to gravel face significant challenges. Riders with superior fitness can struggle to stay with groups due to being gapped repeatedly on technical sections, sandtraps, and loose corners. (https://www.altovelo.org/race-reports/race-report-sea-otter-classic-gravel-race)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Spectator-Friendly:** The Laguna Seca racetrack sections create excellent spectator opportunities, with fans shouting splits and position updates. One rider noted this was "at least a little entertaining" during a difficult race. (https://www.altovelo.org/race-reports/race-report-sea-otter-classic-gravel-race)

**Growth:** Record participation in 2025 with over 700 riders, representing 35% increase over 2024 entries. (https://www.granfondoguide.com/Contents/IndexFull/8466/batten-and-swenson-triumph-at-sea-otter-classic-gravel-race)
