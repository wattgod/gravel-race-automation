## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Alexey Lutsenko [ELITE]:** "I am so happy to win this race, because it was a tough challenge and unforgettable experience for me... It was a difficult race with a technical parcours, very narrow roads and so many corners. We had a plan to attack closer to the finish, but in a moment after another corner I found myself in front with a small gap to the group, so I decided to keep on pushing knowing that I had my teammates behind me in the peloton. Well, I think it was one of the toughest races in my life – 3.5 hours of 100% full gas, but I am really happy I finished it with a victory!"

**Alexey Lutsenko [ELITE]:** "It was really tough because it's all so different from what we're used to. There was no information coming from the team cars and we knew that, in the event of mechanical problems, we had to repair the bikes by ourselves. A feeling that I hadn't felt in a long time. At one stage, with no point of reference or any way of knowing my advantage, just like that I chose my tactic: Alexey, go as fast as you can" (https://journal.wilier.com/en/the-serenissima-gravel-the-race-that-is-all-the-rave)

**Riccardo Minali [ELITE]:** "It is fantastic to conclude the season with a podium, especially at the end of a unique experience like this. It was a difficult race, but we really had fun. I'm looking forward to participating in more gravel races in the future!"

**Giuseppe Martinelli, Sports Director Astana-Premier Tech [ELITE]:** "It was the first experience of this kind of races for everyone, but we came out to the start really motivated to try and to do it in the best possible way... It was such a beautiful race, a bit technical and difficult, especially from the start, but still nice and spectacular. Indeed, it was a serious challenge for all the riders and the race was 100% from the start and until the finish line... It is a new but so nice race which must go on in the next years." (https://qazinform.com/news/astana-s-alexey-lutsenko-wins-serenissima-gravel_a3849821)

**Robin Froidevaux [ELITE]:** "For sure it was unexpected. I'm not too much of a gravel specialist and even in mountain bike, I'm not so good technically, but I took the opportunity and went on the attack. I knew if I stayed with the group, it would be hard technically against the best on the last lap. It worked. I wasn't really believing it until the last kilometre, I'd say." (https://www.cyclingnews.com/races/serenissima-gravel-2022/serenissima-gravel-2022/results/)

**Robin Froidevaux [ELITE]:** "I had an injury on my fingers two-and-a-half months ago. I had to rest for nearly a month and then start training again, so I'm fresher than most of the riders because I didn't have a middle of the season. I'm really happy to win like that." (https://www.cyclingnews.com/races/serenissima-gravel-2022/serenissima-gravel-2022/results/)

**Gianni Vermeersch [ELITE]:** "We got in front with a big group, after Mathieu and myself in particular made the race. But I had to pay for those efforts around halfway through the race and I got surprised. I was afraid I was in a lost position, but with that rainbow jersey around my shoulders I really wanted to fight back." (https://www.cyclingnews.com/races/serenissima-gravel-2022/serenissima-gravel-2022/results/)

**Filippo Pozzato [ELITE]:** "For me, cycling is everything and the love for the sport has a truly international language... I'm looking forward to visiting the United States and cycling among the group to share thoughts, exchange ideas and get to know new realities." (https://www.granfondonationalseries.com/blog/2024/1/30/ride-with-italian-champion-filippo-pozzato-at-2024-gran-fondo-asheville-pb-applewood-manor)

**Filippo Pozzato [ELITE]:** "For me, Flanders was the race... Compared to the bikes we raced on, the Passoni is perfect for enjoying the atmosphere and riding with friends. I was talking to Fabian Cancellara (a three-time winner at Flanders) before the cyclosportive about how the enjoyment of being here is different now. You don't have the stress, you don't have to worry about being skinny, you can eat what you like, and you can just ride for enjoyment." (https://passoni.com/en/journal/meetpozzato)

**TheBlaaMan [UNKNOWN]:** "It looks beautiful but nuts! Great at one level - scenery, route for a ride (whatever about a race) but bonkers, viz safety, from another. Apart from having to contend with joggers and walkers on some of the greenway/gravel sections, riding for sections on footpaths outside houses, all while going at 40-50kmph on some these areas looks scary." (https://www.boards.ie/discussion/2058214990/serenissima-gravel)

**Macy0161 [UNKNOWN]:** "Consensus seemed to be it would need a change of course to scale up because of the narrowness of some sectors. iirc one of the riders said it would totally change it as well, as with the full peloton/teams it becomes more about the fight for position on the tarmac sections entering the sectors, especially if it stayed on narrow trails." (https://www.boards.ie/discussion/2058214990/serenissima-gravel)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Course characteristics (2021 edition):** 132 kilometers total, with 110 km of off-road routes out of 132 (approximately 83% gravel). Started from Jesolo to Piazzola sul Brenta, even traversing through Treviso (a city of 100,000 inhabitants) over gravel. (https://journal.wilier.com/en/the-serenissima-gravel-the-race-that-is-all-the-rave)

**Course characteristics (2022 edition):** 195km in length, 80% billed as being off-road. Start moved from Jesolo down the Venetian coastline to Porto Barricata. Race started from Po Delta and finished at Villa Contarini with finishing circuit. (https://www.cyclingnews.com/races/serenissima-gravel-2022/serenissima-gravel-2022/results/)

**Course characteristics (2025 edition):** 151.6 km, started and finished in Citadella. (https://cyclingflash.com/race/serenissima-gravel-2025)

**Technical details from riders [ELITE]:** "Very narrow roads and so many corners" - the course featured technical parcours with extremely tight sections. Based on single-track and back-country lanes, with few wide-open stretches of stones like those found in races in the United States. (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/alexey-lutsenko-wins-the-first-ever-pro-only-gravel-race-as-racers-welcome-new-format/)

**Safety concerns [UNKNOWN]:** Footage showed sections "so tight that even on a leisure ride on them, you'd have to single out - granted, these were the exceptions." Riders had to contend with joggers and walkers on greenway/gravel sections, riding on footpaths outside houses at 40-50kmph. (https://www.boards.ie/discussion/2058214990/serenissima-gravel)

**Scalability issues:** Multiple sources noted that with just under 40 riders in the inaugural edition, "it's hard to see how more riders could truly contend and no way are you getting a full peloton of 200 on those roads." The narrowness of sectors would require course changes to accommodate larger fields. (https://www.boards.ie/discussion/2058214990/serenissima-gravel)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Winning strategy - Alexey Lutsenko [ELITE]:** Launched a solo attack at 80 kilometers from the finish. Maintained approximately 1-2 minute advantage over chase group through to the end. Race took 3.5 hours at "100% full gas" effort level. Attack came earlier than planned - "We had a plan to attack closer to the finish, but in a moment after another corner I found myself in front with a small gap to the group, so I decided to keep on pushing." (https://journal.wilier.com/en/the-serenissima-gravel-the-race-that-is-all-the-rave)

**Winning strategy - Robin Froidevaux [ELITE, 2022]:** Attacked on the final lap 10km from home, anticipating the gravel specialists. Built lead of almost half a minute with 4km to go. Strategic thinking: "I knew if I stayed with the group, it would be hard technically against the best on the last lap." (https://www.cyclingnews.com/races/serenissima-gravel-2022/serenissima-gravel-2022/results/)

**Race dynamics [ELITE]:** The inaugural race had "100 percent full gas" intensity from start to finish, unlike typical gravel events. The 50-strong peloton (2022) was "already fraying" and "torn into two distinct parts after 70km or so." Early pace was brisk despite the sheer distance. (https://www.cyclingnews.com/races/serenissima-gravel-2022/serenissima-gravel-2022/results/)

**Positioning strategy [ELITE]:** With narrow sectors, the race could become "more about the fight for position on the tarmac sections entering the sectors" with larger fields. (https://www.boards.ie/discussion/2058214990/serenissima-gravel)

## Race Format & Rules

**No team support:** No radios, no team cars, only limited mechanical assistance. Riders had to repair bikes themselves in case of mechanical problems - a feeling many pros "hadn't felt in a long time." (https://journal.wilier.com/en/the-serenissima-gravel-the-race-that-is-all-the-rave)

**Field composition (2021):** Small startlist but deep in talent - included WorldTour teams (Astana-Premier Tech, Cofidis, Intermarché-Wanty-Gobert Materiaux), several Italian ProTeam squads, and Continental Qhubeka team. Approximately 40 riders total. (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/alexey-lutsenko-wins-the-first-ever-pro-only-gravel-race-as-racers-welcome-new-format/)

**Professional-only format:** First-ever pro-only gravel event on the calendar, part of former Milano-Sanremo champion Filippo Pozzato's "Ride the Wonderland" series. (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/alexey-lutsenko-wins-the-first-ever-pro-only-gravel-race-as-racers-welcome-new-format/)

**Gender equity issue (2021):** The inaugural edition had a 0% female field - no women's race was included despite being billed as the world's first 100% pro gravel race. Pro racer Alison Tetrick responded: "Don't tell me you are introducing a professional aspect of MY sport and not include EVERYONE." (https://dirttanbikeclub.com/2021/11/12/a-thousand-to-none-grassroots-and-pro-gravel-keep-different-scores/)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Pro reception:** "It is a new but so nice race which must go on in the next years. It was a pleasure to ride Serenissima Gravel today and I hope this race will get a big future" - Giuseppe Martinelli [ELITE]. Multiple pros expressed enthusiasm for future gravel races. (https://qazinform.com/news/astana-s-alexey-lutsenko-wins-serenissima-gravel_a3849821)

**Historical cycling appeal:** "This race has already won the enthusiasm of those who love the cycling of the past" - described as "a combination of the most hard-core cycling technology and the heroic style, made of unsupported racers, reeling in the dust." (https://journal.wilier.com/en/the-serenissima-gravel-the-race-that-is-all-the-rave)

**Part of larger event series:** Serenissima Gravel is second in a four-part "Ride the Wonderland" series organized by Filippo Pozzato and Jonny Moletta, including Giro del Veneto (road race), Granfondo VENEtoGO (mass-participation), and Veneto Classic (pro road race). (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/alexey-lutsenko-wins-the-first-ever-pro-only-gravel-race-as-racers-welcome-new-format/)

**Organizer vision:** "We are trying to organize a race that allows spectators to be able to see more stages of the race, a bit like the Tour of Flanders. The idea is to create a stadium atmosphere." - Filippo Pozzato. Future plans include starting from Piazza San Marco. (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/alexey-lutsenko-wins-the-first-ever-pro-only-gravel-race-as-racers-welcome-new-format/)

**Setting:** Route showcases the Veneto region of Italy, featuring ancient charm and spectacular scenery around Villa Contarini (16th-century villa). (https://www.granfondonationalseries.com/blog/2024/1/30/ride-with-italian-champion-filippo-pozzato-at-2024-gran-fondo-asheville-pb-applewood-manor)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Winning bike - Alexey Lutsenko [ELITE]:** Wilier Rave SLR in gravel setup. Bike was "brand new: almost literally fresh out of the factory" for the race. The Rave SLR is designed with "two separate souls, perfect for all-road, perfect for gravel" with racing inclination. (https://journal.wilier.com/en/the-serenissima-gravel-the-race-that-is-all-the-rave)

**Bike choice - Filippo Pozzato [ELITE]:** Uses Passoni Vinci (titanium) for general gravel riding with "same geometry as when I was racing" - extremely aggressive position that fitters might question for non-pros. For gravel event scouting, uses Passoni Cicloprato gravel bike with "same ride position as on my road bike combined with standard gravel geometry." (https://passoni.com/en/journal/meetpozzato)

**Camera moto usage:** Camera motorcycles were used on greenway sections for filming - "essential for the film and thus marketing of the event" but "questionable" from safety perspective on narrow trails. (https://www.boards.ie/discussion/2058214990/serenissima-gravel)
