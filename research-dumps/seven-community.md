**Cassia Boglio [ELITE]:** Built a comfortable 5-minute lead with 30km to go, leading "step by step from early in the race," but was caught in the final 5km and finished second. (https://ucigravelworldseries.com/en/national-champions-show-power-on-2026-worlds-courses/)

**Todd P. [UNKNOWN]:** "This bike is incredible. The ride is so smooth and responsive. Seriously, I cannot say enough good things about this bike and the entire process." (Regarding Seven Cycles Gravel 45 frameset) (https://sevencycles.com/category/gravel/g-45700-rr-fs.php)

**Anonymous blogger [ELITE]:** At Seven Hills Killer 2012 (Isle of Wight), finished first place with time of 2hrs 11mins, "8 minutes clear of second place." Noted: "it was a lot more than the sub 2-hour times that I have ridden the course in previously" due to "horrendous conditions" with "block headwind and showers of spray." Race "seemed to blur into one big, wet, windy, mud fest." (https://www.lifeinthesaddle.cc/2012/09/race-report-seven-hills-killer-2012.html)

**Eric Senseman [UNKNOWN]:** On Black Canyon 100k: "Like most any point-to-point trail, the elevation at one end isn't the same as the elevation at the other end. In the case of the Black Canyon Trail, the north trailhead sits at about 4,200 feet above sea level and the southern terminus rests around 1,900 feet. The 100k itself runs north-to-south, so the course accumulates a net downhill." (https://www.aravaiparunning.com/category/race-report/page/2/)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Course Profile:** The full SEVEN course is 125km (adjusted to 126km in 2026) with approximately 3200-3400 vertical metres of climbing. The route features seven distinct gravel sectors: Reveley, Brockman's Farm, Maidment, The Crucible, Arcadia, The Labyrinth, and Glacier Valley. (https://sevengravelrace.com/race-and-routes/)

**Climbs:** "Ten major climbs of SEVEN are amongst the best that the State has to offer. These climbs range in length from 1.2km to 4.5km long with gradients frequently touching on 20%." The Category 3 climbs are "particularly challenging for tired legs." (https://sevengravelrace.com/race-and-routes/)

**Surface Description:** "The 2026 route has no single track and no fire trails. All the roads used in SEVEN are unpaved and well-formed with a mix of dirt, gravel, hard-packed clay, quartz grit and mica. They wind, climb, switchback and descend through pine plantations, state forest and farms. The best way we can describe the roads of SEVEN is 'parallel single track'. They are exciting, challenging and magnificent to ride." (https://sevengravelrace.com/race-and-routes/)

**Location Context:** The course is located in the "golden triangle of cycling" formed by connecting Nannup, Bridgetown, and Balingup townships. The area contains approximately 30,000 acres with "in excess of 1000km of rideable roads and trails." Nannup is approximately 35-45 minutes from Busselton and Margaret River.

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**[ELITE] Pacing Advice:** "Our advice is to not use too much energy too early. The Category 3 climbs are particularly challenging for tired legs." (https://sevengravelrace.com/race-and-routes/)

**[ELITE] Late-Race Strategy:** Mark O'Brien's winning move came "on a climb with 10 kilometers to go" - suggesting the race is decided late on one of the final climbs. (https://ucigravelworldseries.com/en/national-champions-show-power-on-2026-worlds-courses/)

**[ELITE] Time Expectations:** Elite riders have completed the course in sub-2 hours in good conditions (Isle of Wight Seven Hills), but harsh weather pushed the winning time to 2hrs 11mins - a significant difference. (https://www.lifeinthesaddle.cc/2012/09/race-report-seven-hills-killer-2012.html)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Time Cutoffs:** The full SEVEN course has a 10-hour time limit. "For many, just completing the 125km course in the allotted ten hours will be an achievement." The race explicitly acknowledges: "We would be wrong to say there is no fail, as a number of riders do miss the cut-off each year." (https://sevengravelrace.com/race-and-routes/)

**Equipment Failure Example [ELITE - different race]:** At Oulton Park Mini Seven race: Clutch failure during qualifying due to "a loose locknut on the free play adjuster assembly" - a "simple fix but so annoying" that nearly derailed the race day. (https://blog.minisport.com/2014/07/mini-seven-race-report-oulton-park/)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**International Draw:** "The course that brings riders from around the world" - 1,600 riders started in 2025. (https://sevengravelrace.com/, https://ucigravelworldseries.com/en/national-champions-show-power-on-2026-worlds-courses/)

**Event Description:** "SEVEN Gravel Race is your opportunity to ride or race the sectors with other like-minded gravel enthusiasts, on one wonderful day in May."

**Reputation:** "Believe the hype and experience for yourself why the world is coming to SEVEN!" Described as "arguably one of the toughest one-day races in Australia, and the most challenging course in the 2024 UCI Gravel World Series."

**2026 Worlds Preview:** The 2025 race serves as a preview for riders, as SEVEN will host the 2026 UCI Gravel World Championships in October 2026. (https://sevengravelrace.com/)

**Regional Tourism Context:** The location is "the home of the Tour of Margaret River Road Race and the Cape to Cape MTB Race, and is now being recognised as a premier destination for cyclists with a love of gravel and a passion for exploring." (https://sevengravelrace.com/race-and-routes/)
