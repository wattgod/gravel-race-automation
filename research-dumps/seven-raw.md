## **TERRAIN & COURSE (Western Australia Specifics)**
**Surface Breakdown:** Unlike the flat, red desert "Outback" many imagine, Nannup is in the "Golden Triangle" of forestry. The course is **96% unpaved**.
* **"Parallel Singletrack":** The organizers describe the roads not as wide gravel highways, but as winding, narrow tracks through pine plantations and state forests.
* **Quartz Grit & Mica:** The surface contains sharp quartz grit and mica, which can slice thin sidewalls.
* **Clay Base:** Some sections are hard-packed clay. If it rains (possible in May), this can become slick, though it generally drains better than "Unbound" mud.
* **Climbing:** This is a climber's race. 3,200m of gain in 125km is a very high ratio (comparable to rigorous mountain stages). There are **12-13 categorised climbs**.

## **WEATHER & HEAT (Australian Autumn)**
**Season:** May is Autumn in the Southern Hemisphere.
* **Temps:** Expect cool mornings (~7-9°C / 45-48°F) warming to comfortable days (~18-22°C / 64-72°F). It is **not** blistering outback heat.
* **Rain Risk:** Nannup receives ~600mm rain annually. May is the start of the wetter season. In 2024, rain the day before "settled the dust," but heavy rain can make descents treacherous.
* **Sunrise:** ~7:00 AM (Race starts at 7:00 AM sharp, often in dawn light).

## **REMOTE RIDING CONSIDERATIONS**
* **Wildlife Hazard:** The official "Survival Guide" explicitly warns riders about collisions with **Western Grey Kangaroos**, **Emus**, and **Wild Pigs**. This is a real danger, especially on fast, silent descents.
* **Isolation:** While not deep desert, the "sectors" wind through active forestry logging areas where there is **zero cell signal**. You are reliant on the event's moto marshals and sweepers.
* **Water:** There are checkpoints, but this is a self-supported ethos race. You must carry sufficient hydration between sectors (often 20-30km gaps with slow average speeds due to climbing).

## **EQUIPMENT CONSENSUS**
* **Tires:** **40mm - 45mm** is the standard.
	* *Consensus:* You need **reinforced sidewalls** (e.g., Maxxis Rambler EXO, Pirelli Cinturato M, Continental Terra Trail Protection) due to the quartz rocks. Slick center treads are risky on the steep, loose climbs ("The Crucible").
* **Gearing:** **Mullet drivetrains** (Road shifters + MTB derailleur/cassette) are highly recommended. With 3,200m of climbing and 20% grades, a 1:1 ratio (40t/40t) is often insufficient for mere mortals. You want a 50t or 52t granny gear.
* **Bike:** Gravel bike is faster than a hardtail MTB, but a hardtail would be comfortable on the descents.

## **LOGISTICS**
* **Airport:** Fly into **Perth (PER)**.
* **Transfer:** Drive ~260km (3 hours) South to Nannup.
* **Accommodation:** Nannup is a tiny town (pop. ~1,300). Accommodation **sells out instantly**.
	* *Strategy:* Many riders stay in **Busselton** (45 min drive), **Margaret River** (45 min drive), or Bridgetown.
	* *Camping:* The event village offers unpowered camping/caravan sites which is the "authentic" way to experience it.
* **Rental Cars:** Essential. Public transport to Nannup is virtually non-existent for a bike racer with a bike box.

## **YOUTUBE RACE REPORTS**
**Video:** "SEVEN GRAVEL RACE 2024 | RACE HIGHLIGHTS"
