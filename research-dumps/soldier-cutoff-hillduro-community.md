## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Gary Wenzl [RECREATIONAL]:** "This was my first race after recovering from a crash in June. Due to rain, they went with the 'very wet route,' which took out all MMRs and some very scenic roads. There was still plenty of nice views. Only 2720 feet of recorded elevation, but it was some of the most challenging (afterwards eating lunch, someone said the one climb was 17% at a certain point near the top near the top). The race was fun and started out well, but with 30 miles left to go, I started getting leg cramps, and on the last steep climb, it was like they locked up on me, and I even had a hard time getting them to unclip. Luckily I didn't fall over and walked the bike up the rest of the climb. Last 5 miles was torture. It was cool and overcast (starting out at 47° and finishing at 57°); hydration and electrolytes was if anything a little over, so not sure why I was cramping so badly. Overall I came in 16 out of 19." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/garys-story-soldier-cutoff-hillduro)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

The race features significant climbing despite relatively modest total elevation numbers. Gary Wenzl noted that despite "only 2720 feet of recorded elevation," it was "some of the most challenging" with one climb reported to hit 17% gradient near the top. The last steep climb was particularly difficult, causing complete leg lockup for at least one rider. (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/garys-story-soldier-cutoff-hillduro)

Race organizers describe the route as swinging around Preparation Canyon State Park and winding through the valleys of the Little Sioux River and Soldier River Cutoff, with elevation estimated at over 4,000 feet on the standard route. The geography is described as "diverse and challenging" with climbs opening up to vistas and descents leading to less-travelled areas.

The race location in the Loess Hills State Forest area features "the most unique terrain in all of Iowa" with "lots of hills." (https://www.granfondoguide.com/Events/Index/10857/soldier-cutoff-hillduro)

**Weather-dependent routing:** The 2025 race used a "very wet route" due to rain, which eliminated all MMRs (presumably Minimum Maintenance Roads) and some scenic roads. (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/garys-story-soldier-cutoff-hillduro)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Cramping issues [RECREATIONAL perspective]:** Gary Wenzl experienced severe leg cramps starting with 30 miles to go, despite cool temperatures (47-57°F) and reportedly adequate hydration and electrolyte intake. The cramping became severe enough on the final steep climb that his legs "locked up" and he had difficulty unclipping, requiring him to walk the bike. He described the "last 5 miles was torture." This occurred for a rider finishing 16th of 19, suggesting cramping may be a risk factor for back-of-pack finishers even with proper fueling.
