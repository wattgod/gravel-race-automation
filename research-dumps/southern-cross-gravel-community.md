# SOUTHERN CROSS GRAVEL — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**TimothyH [ELITE]:** "I planned to ride my 2020 Specialized Epic Hardtail, not having even purchased a gravel bike until mid-February, and having heard from several sources that several of the descents and the singletrack portion of the race were much faster on a mountain bike. That is, until the early spring rains hit. On Thursday, less than 36 hours before the race, the race director sent out an e-mail to let participants know that the race would no longer contain any singletrack due to the weather conditions." (https://ridefierceracing.com/2020/03/09/race-report-southern-cross-gravel-grinder/)

**TimothyH [ELITE]:** "The gravel varied from smooth hardpack to rocky, rutted-out dirt roads to coarse freshly-poured limestone chunks... I was a bit nervous about the descents with so little experience with how a drop bar 'skinny' tire bike handles on loose gravel turns, but the bike was a champ. I hit the downhills in true mountain-biker fashion and the bike stuck with me the whole way." (https://ridefierceracing.com/2020/03/09/race-report-southern-cross-gravel-grinder/)

**TimothyH [ELITE]:** "I did end up flatting twice (about a mile apart) on the final long descent as I was going full-send over rough rock and large washboard bumps. I initially thought I had burped my tires, but after careful inspection, while washing my bike the next day, realized I had a 1/4 inch slice in my tire right along the rim." (https://ridefierceracing.com/2020/03/09/race-report-southern-cross-gravel-grinder/)

**TimothyH [ELITE]:** "In the end, I finished 12th (out of 23) in Open/Elite Women. Without the flats, I would likely have been top ten, but that is a part of racing. I'm more than happy with how I rode this weekend, and stoked at setting 20, 60, and 90 minute power PRs during the race." (https://ridefierceracing.com/2020/03/09/race-report-southern-cross-gravel-grinder/)

**Jason Lopez [ELITE]:** "The start of the Southern Cross Gravel race was a total mess. I am quite disappointed again with the start of this race. Riders were told to line up based on estimated finish times. I was close to the front, and I made sure to line up early to have a good starting position... As the time neared the start of the race, more riders lined up on the side of the road near the front riders. Everyone needed to squeeze through and over the time strip, which was only the width of the road. Once I finally crossed the start line, even though I was 5 rows back from the start, it seemed like I was a quarter mile back already." (https://jaylocycling.com/2023-southern-cross-gravel-race-report/)

**Jason Lopez [ELITE]:** "Remember, if you are planning on finishing on the podium or somewhere near in this race, make sure you line up on the front couple rows and expect to fight for a position from people squeezing in on the sides. You will need to bolt-off right at the start too." (https://jaylocycling.com/2023-southern-cross-gravel-race-report/)

**Jason Lopez [ELITE]:** "The roads were hard packed roads with small chunks of gravel and there were no soft or muddy sections. They were typical service roads that you will find in most nation parks and forests." (https://jaylocycling.com/2023-southern-cross-gravel-race-report/)

**Jason Lopez [ELITE]:** "The first climb took me about 40 mins, and I was riding close to threshold for that climb. I felt like walking a few times, but I pushed through to the top and began the first descent." (https://jaylocycling.com/2023-southern-cross-gravel-race-report/)

**Jason Lopez [ELITE]:** "The first descent section was quite epic. It was fast and a bit technical at times. It had some tight chicanes with a steep drop off on one side. There were large rocks in the road that you had to be careful of and there were large ruts in some turns. It was a blast. I topped out at 38 mph on that descent." (https://jaylocycling.com/2023-southern-cross-gravel-race-report/)

**Jason Lopez [ELITE]:** "I was a quarter of the way down, passing people like crazy, flying around turns, and floating over bumpy sections. And just like that, my Southern Cross Gravel race was over! I hit a rock going around a turn. I heard a hiss, and I knew something was wrong... I got a pinch flat. I had a small cut on the side wall close to where the edge of the rim and tire meet. I had a tube with me and placed the tube into the tire. I watched people that I had passed a while back zoom by me. All that work for nothing. I was running about 40 psi in my Specialized Pathfinder Pro 42 mm, so low tire pressure was not the fault." (https://jaylocycling.com/2023-southern-cross-gravel-race-report/)

**Jason Lopez [ELITE]:** "Apart from the start of Southern Cross Gravel race, I was quite slow on the climbs and was passed by quite a few riders. Once I reached the top of the climbs, I was flying down the descents and pass a lot of the riders that passed me on the climbs. If it was not for the flat tire, I think I would have finished around 3 hrs 20 mins." (https://jaylocycling.com/2023-southern-cross-gravel-race-report/)

**TimothyH [ELITE]:** "Tried to keep up with a group of fast riders and blew up pretty bad today." (https://www.bikeforums.net/cyclocross-gravelbiking-recreational/1098455-gravel-ride-pics-20.html)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**[ELITE] Bike Choice - Gravel vs Mountain Bike:**
- **TimothyH [ELITE]:** Used Specialized Diverge gravel bike (after originally planning mountain bike): "Really, I've been extremely happy with that bike every since purchasing it almost a month ago. It climbs like a fast road bike, absorbs an impressive amount of road and gravel chatter, and is all-around a fun ride." Noted that with singletrack removed due to weather, gravel bike was the right choice. (https://ridefierceracing.com/2020/03/09/race-report-southern-cross-gravel-grinder/)

**[ELITE] Tire Pressure Warning:**
- **Jason Lopez [ELITE]:** "I was running about 40 psi in my Specialized Pathfinder Pro 42 mm, so low tire pressure was not the fault" when he got a pinch flat from hitting a rock on a descent. This suggests 40 psi was NOT too low, but the impact was severe enough to cause a sidewall cut anyway. (https://jaylocycling.com/2023-southern-cross-gravel-race-report/)

**[ELITE] Tire Sealant:**
- **TimothyH [ELITE]:** "Impressively, the tire sealed up both times when I put CO2 in it (thanks Orange Seal!), though it re-opened the slice anytime I hit a large bump" — used Orange Seal sealant which temporarily sealed a 1/4 inch tire slice. (https://ridefierceracing.com/2020/03/09/race-report-southern-cross-gravel-grinder/)

**[ELITE] Race Kit/Gear:**
- **TimothyH [ELITE]:** Used Osprey race vest for the first time during this race to carry supplies. (https://ridefierceracing.com/2020/03/09/race-report-southern-cross-gravel-grinder/)

## Weather Experienced

**2020 Race Weekend:**
- **TimothyH [ELITE]:** "It was MUCH colder than I had anticipated, reaching a low of about 28F overnight" when camping Friday night before the race. Early spring rains hit during the week before the race, causing course changes (singletrack removed). (https://ridefierceracing.com/2020/03/09/race-report-southern-cross-gravel-grinder/)

**2023 Race Weekend:**
- **Jason Lopez [ELITE]:** Described conditions as "quite warm for early March and the sun was hot. There were no trees or shade" at the post-race venue. (https://jaylocycling.com/2023-southern-cross-gravel-race-report/)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Course Surface Variety:**
- **TimothyH [ELITE]:** "The gravel varied from smooth hardpack to rocky, rutted-out dirt roads to coarse freshly-poured limestone chunks." (https://ridefierceracing.com/2020/03/09/race-report-southern-cross-gravel-grinder/)

- **Jason Lopez [ELITE]:** "The roads were hard packed roads with small chunks of gravel and there were no soft or muddy sections. They were typical service roads that you will find in most nation parks and forests." (https://jaylocycling.com/2023-southern-cross-gravel-race-report/)

**Climbing Profile:**
- **Jason Lopez [ELITE]:** "The course had two main climbs. The first one was about 7.5 miles long and about 1700 ft of climbing and the second was about 10 miles long with about 1350 ft of climbing." First major climb took him 40 minutes at near-threshold effort. (https://jaylocycling.com/2023-southern-cross-gravel-race-report/)

**Descent Characteristics:**
- **Jason Lopez [ELITE]:** "The first descent section took about 25 min. It comprised of a quick descent then an undulating section of ups and downs and into another quick but longer descent. The first descent section was quite epic. It was fast and a bit technical at times. It had some tight chicanes with a steep drop off on one side. There were large rocks in the road that you had to be careful of and there were large ruts in some turns... I topped out at 38 mph on that descent." (https://jaylocycling.com/2023-southern-cross-gravel-race-report/)

**Finish Line:**
- Course description notes "a grass section in the last half mile to the finish" at Montaluce Winery. (https://mountaingoatadventures.com/southernx)

**Course Setting:**
- **TimothyH [ELITE]:** "The course itself is stunning. Consisting almost entirely of gravel roads, the course winds through the Chattahoochee National Forest. With two long climbs that wind up the side of the mountains then drop into ripping descents back down to the rhododendron-filled valleys, it was a perfect route to test the limits of the winter's training." (https://ridefierceracing.com/2020/03/09/race-report-southern-cross-gravel-grinder/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**[ELITE] Start Positioning Critical:**
- **Jason Lopez [ELITE]:** "Remember, if you are planning on finishing on the podium or somewhere near in this race, make sure you line up on the front couple rows and expect to fight for a position from people squeezing in on the sides. You will need to bolt-off right at the start too." Notes that even lining up 5 rows back meant being "a quarter mile back already" after the bottleneck start. (https://jaylocycling.com/2023-southern-cross-gravel-race-report/)

**[ELITE] Race Goes Hard Early:**
- **Jason Lopez [ELITE]:** "The race started at 10 a.m. with me towards the back of nearly 300 riders... The start of Southern Cross Gravel race was a road section with some small punchy climbs into some quick descents. That road section led into the first gravel section and into a short but steep climb. Right away everything splintered. There were about 5 short punchy climbs before hitting the first climb." The field splits immediately on punchy climbs before the first major sustained climb. (https://jaylocycling.com/2023-southern-cross-gravel-race-report/)

**[ELITE] Climbing vs Descending Ability:**
- **Jason Lopez [ELITE]:** "Apart from the start of Southern Cross Gravel race, I was quite slow on the climbs and was passed by quite a few riders. Once I reached the top of the climbs, I was flying down the descents and pass a lot of the riders that passed me on the climbs." Good descenders can make up significant time on technical descents. (https://jaylocycling.com/2023-southern-cross-gravel-race-report/)

**[ELITE] Pacing Effort:**
- **Jason Lopez [ELITE]:** First major climb (7.5 miles, 1700 ft) took 40 minutes "riding close to threshold for that climb. I felt like walking a few times, but I pushed through." (https://jaylocycling.com/2023-southern-cross-gravel-race-report/)

**[ELITE] Drop Bag Strategy:**
- Race allows "up to TWO gallon-sized ziploc bags to the aid station" - riders can pre-position supplies at the aid station which is passed twice. (https://mountaingoatadventures.com/southernx)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Mechanical Issues - Flats on Descents:**
- **TimothyH [ELITE]:** Double flatted on the final long descent: "I did end up flatting twice (about a mile apart) on the final long descent as I was going full-send over rough rock and large washboard bumps." Got a 1/4 inch slice in tire along the rim. "By looking at the slice, its a miracle I wasn't walking the last 4 miles...or at least taking the time to put a tube in." (https://ridefierceracing.com/2020/03/09/race-report-southern-cross-gravel-grinder/)

- **Jason Lopez [ELITE]:** Pinch flat from hitting a rock mid-descent ended his competitive race: "I was a quarter of the way down, passing people like crazy, flying around turns, and floating over bumpy sections. And just like that, my Southern Cross Gravel race was over! I hit a rock going around a turn." Repair took 20 minutes. "I was not quite ready for getting a flat. I took me a little while to realize I should put a tube in (forgot I had a tube on me)." (https://jaylocycling.com/2023-southern-cross-gravel-race-report/)

**Time Cutoffs:**
- Official race info: "All racers must complete the entire course and be in by 5:30pm to have an official finish time. There will be time cutoffs at the aid stations to ensure you can make it back by 5:30pm." Specifically: "cut-off at the Mile 12 aid station at 1:30 pm." (https://mountaingoatadventures.com/southernx)

**Pacing Errors:**
- **TimothyH [ELITE]:** "Tried to keep up with a group of fast riders and blew up pretty bad today" in a later year. (https://www.bikeforums.net/cyclocross-gravelbiking-recreational/1098455-gravel-ride-pics-20.html)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Pre-Race Camping:**
- **TimothyH [ELITE]:** "Upon arriving around midnight, I opted to sleep in the backseat of my car rather than take the time to put up my tent in the dark... In the morning, I noticed that some fellow campers had brought a portable fire pit and were gathering around a fire and I took the opportunity to make some new friends and warm up next to the fire before preparing for the race." Free primitive camping available on-site. (https://ridefierceracing.com/2020/03/09/race-report-southern-cross-gravel-grinder/)

**Course Marshaling:**
- Race info promises "Clearly marked course with course marshals and 'wrong way' indicators at confusing intersections" and "Priceless memories of your race, especially if the weather or your preparation is less than ideal. No extra charge for character building!" (https://mountaingoatadventures.com/southernx)

**Aid Station Atmosphere:**
- Race info: Aid stations include "calories, fluids, first aid, mechanical support, hecklers and warm hugs." (https://mountaingoatadventures.com/southernx)

**Post-Race:**
- **Jason Lopez [ELITE]:** "It was quite warm for early March and the sun was hot. There were no trees or shade and there was nowhere to sit apart from the ground. The was music blasting and it seemed like people were socializing. The post event was decent, but the food saved it mostly. The food for Southern Cross Gravel race was catered by Moe's Southwest Grill. The food boxes included a large burrito with your choice of steak, chicken, or veggie and with chips and salsa inside. It was quite good and really hit the spot. You could also get 2 beers." (https://jaylocycling.com/2023-southern-cross-gravel-race-report/)

**Registration Demand:**
- **Jason Lopez [ELITE]:** "This event should be at a minimum 75 miles, but probably closer to 100 miles... Gravel is an endurance sport, and if the event isn't 4 hrs minimum it will not be a top tier event... The front riders finished in 2 hrs 37 mins which is blazing fast, but if you are driving more than 1 to 1.5 hrs away, it is not worth the drive." Notes the race sells out quickly. (https://jaylocycling.com/2023-southern-cross-gravel-race-report/)

**Bike Shop Support:**
- Nimblewheels Bicycles from downtown Dahlonega provides "neutral mechanical support" at the Winding Stair Gap Aid Station during the race. (https://mountaingoatadventures.com/southernx)
