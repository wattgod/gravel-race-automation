**Anonymous rider testimonials [UNKNOWN]:**
- "Total adult summer camp vibe, but way better! Traveled to the event solo but never felt alone." (https://www.thespiritworld100.com)
- "The Spirit World is in a class by itself. It is a gathering of people who love bikes and people. Every single person at the event was absolutely, simply goodness!" (https://www.thespiritworld100.com)
- "Felt like a small community of friends who happen to ride 100 miles of gravel. The vibe was amazing!" (https://www.thespiritworld100.com)
- "It reminds me of local grassroots MTB races when I was a child, but with a completely different race experience from anything I've ever done. It is simply the coolest event." (https://www.thespiritworld100.com)

**Heidi Rentz [ELITE/RACE DIRECTOR]:** "I put the fear of death in the cyclists [during orientation remarks] the night before. It's worked every year. I tell them to take it down two notches from what they would ride at home on the descents. If you fall, it's really hard to rescue you. And if you make a wrong turn, you go to Mexico. They all listened to me. I think it's helped with our overall vibe, as well—I think it's kind of made people less competitive overall, and just to really be out there and enjoy the beauty of the San Rafael Valley."

## Weather Experienced

**2019 Race Day [COMPETITIVE source]:** "The weather on the day was spectacular; temps hovered in the high 70s and winds were not a factor." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gallery/bikes-on-the-borderlands-the-spirit-world-100/)

**2019 Pre-Season [COMPETITIVE source]:** "A record-breaking monsoon season this year yielded high grass and happy cows." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gallery/bikes-on-the-borderlands-the-spirit-world-100/)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Course Overview:** "You have 10 hours to ride your bike to the border of Mexico and back." The event is described as taking place in "the Patagonia region of Arizona" with "the most magical gravel road network." (https://www.thespiritworld100.com)

**San Rafael Valley:** "Riders spend most of the day moving through the wide expanse of the San Rafael Valley, a high grass valley buffeted by the Patagonia Mountains, the Canelo Hills, and the Huachuca Mountains." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gallery/bikes-on-the-borderlands-the-spirit-world-100/)

**Opening Climb:** "The first climb out of Patagonia and up Harshaw Creek Road gets me every time — does that look like what you imagine when you think of southern Arizona?" (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gallery/gallery-the-spirit-of-gravel-revisited/)

**Border Proximity:** "Every course distance brushes the border between Arizona and Mexico — those mountains lie beyond a wall that is visible from the course." The San Rafael Valley is home to "hundreds of hundred-acre ranches." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gallery/gallery-the-spirit-of-gravel-revisited/)

**Start Format:** "Saturday morning at 7:00 A.M., the Spirit World 100 begins with a three-mile neutral roll-out on pavement, led by the local border patrol." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gallery/bikes-on-the-borderlands-the-spirit-world-100/)

**Course Marking [IMPORTANT]:** "A LIGHTLY MARKED COURSE - You are required to upload your course on a GPS to ensure that you do not miss a turn! Signage will be limited." (https://www.thespiritworld100.com)

**Final Aid Station:** "The Boomshakalaka Bar, the race's final aid station, sits near the base of the rocky outcropping. Legend has it that Heidi Ault exclaimed 'Boomshakalaka!' upon seeing the views for the first time on a bike ride there five years ago. On tap at the Boomshakalaka Bar: ice cold Coca-Cola." Located approximately 10 miles from the finish. (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gallery/bikes-on-the-borderlands-the-spirit-world-100/)

**Terrain Character:** The host community of Patagonia sits "about 20 miles north of the Mexico border, straight as the crow flies. Its population is as diverse as the borderlands ecology that surrounds it — miners, artists, ranchers, and naturalists are among the tiny town's full-time residents." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gallery/bikes-on-the-borderlands-the-spirit-world-100/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Safety-First Pacing [RACE DIRECTOR advice to ALL LEVELS]:** Race director Heidi Rentz instructs all riders: "Take it down two notches from what they would ride at home on the descents. If you fall, it's really hard to rescue you. And if you make a wrong turn, you go to Mexico." This safety emphasis has "made people less competitive overall, and just to really be out there and enjoy the beauty of the San Rafael Valley." (https://patagoniaregionaltimes.org/how-spirit-world-100-went-this-year-and-where-its-going-next/)

**Time Cut Information:** The race tagline states "You have 10 hours to ride your bike to the border of Mexico and back" (https://www.thespiritworld100.com), though 2019 results show finishers beyond 10 hours were recorded.

**Race Philosophy:** "While there is certainly a race at the Spirit World 100, it doesn't necessarily resemble other events where group dynamics dominate. Could it be the small field? The late date? The distance from most places? Somehow, racing in the spirit world is different." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gallery/bikes-on-the-borderlands-the-spirit-world-100/)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Mechanical Issues [2019]:** "Only a handful of punctures and one broken pedal constituted the event's round-up of mechanicals." Dustin Stiffler offered pop-up mechanic services out of the Patagonia Lumber Company in the days before the race. (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gallery/bikes-on-the-borderlands-the-spirit-world-100/)

**Navigation Risk:** With "A LIGHTLY MARKED COURSE," riders are required to use GPS devices. The race director warns that wrong turns can lead to Mexico. (https://www.thespiritworld100.com and https://patagoniaregionaltimes.org/how-spirit-world-100-went-this-year-and-where-its-going-next/)

**Injuries [2024]:** Race organizer Zander Ault noted: "These events can see everything from a scraped knee to a death on course. Thankfully the Spirit World has had a good run, and this year we experienced that again. We had a couple crashes out there—a couple bruised knees, maybe a few bruised egos—but nothing that needed any serious medical attention." Sonoita-Elgin Fire District provided on-course EMTs in 2024. (https://patagoniaregionaltimes.org/how-spirit-world-100-went-this-year-and-where-its-going-next/)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Event Size & Intimacy:** In 2019, 125 riders participated in the inaugural event. By 2024, organizers doubled that to 250 registered riders. "Although interest in the Spirit World 100 exceeds allotted spots, the organizers are committed to keeping it intimate." Total attendance including support crew reached approximately 450 people in 2024. (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gallery/bikes-on-the-borderlands-the-spirit-world-100/ and https://patagoniaregionaltimes.org/how-spirit-world-100-went-this-year-and-where-its-going-next/)

**Gender Representation:** Race director Heidi Rentz noted: "It's about 38% female, which for a cycling event like this, that's really high. Usually it's like 17% female. So that's kind of a cool difference between our event and others." She attributes this partly to her presence as a female race director. (https://patagoniaregionaltimes.org/how-spirit-world-100-went-this-year-and-where-its-going-next/)

**Local Business Integration:** "This was a really cool year. It was the first year that we really felt like we had the time and the ability to reach out to our local downtown business sector... Quail Covey was super-supportive this year. Red Mountain Foods jumped on board, Queen of Cups, Mary Tolena's Terrasol. We also had The Meading Room, Deep Sky Vineyard and Rune Wines. Everyone came to the event." Local businesses serving throughout weekend: Presta coffee, Pueblo Vida beer, and Rune wine. (https://patagoniaregionaltimes.org/how-spirit-world-100-went-this-year-and-where-its-going-next/ and https://velo.outsideonline.com/gallery/bikes-on-the-borderlands-the-spirit-world-100/)

**Race Philosophy:** "The Aults have crafted the Spirit World 100 to be unlike any other gravel race. It bursts with sights, sounds, and smells specific to the region, as well as to the couple's own taste." Race directors want riders to "pay close attention to two locations — the literal Arizona borderlands, as well as the more metaphysical spirit world, wherever that may be." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gallery/bikes-on-the-borderlands-the-spirit-world-100/)

**What's Included:** Live music and entertainment throughout the weekend, group rides on Friday and Sunday, gravel family dinner, post-race meal, handmade Spirit World ceramic mug, stocked aid stations, medical & safety support, awards to top 3 finishers of each course distance, and optional post-race Pivot Cycles mountain bike group ride. (https://www.thespiritworld100.com)

**Organizers' Connection:** Zander and Heidi Ault are race co-founders who also run The Cyclist's Menu cycling camps, co-own The Gravel House in Patagonia, and opened the Patagonia Lumber Company (a gathering place/bar/cafe in a historic building) which serves as a weekend hub. (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gallery/bikes-on-the-borderlands-the-spirit-world-100/ and https://patagoniaregionaltimes.org/how-spirit-world-100-went-this-year-and-where-its-going-next/)

**Community Relations:** Organizers work closely with South32 (mining operations) and border wall contractors on route safety. "This is probably the sixth year that we've really worked with them in a big way. And they just continue to get more supportive and more aware of the fact that safety is our number one priority—as it is theirs, as well." Some minor friction with ranching community regarding rider groups blocking passage; organizers plan to improve outreach. (https://patagoniaregionaltimes.org/how-spirit-world-100-went-this-year-and-where-its-going-next/)

**International Reach:** By 2024, "we had riders from Europe this year, as well as a pro rider from Kenya. That has to do not only with the growth in the event, but just the general level of media and press that cycling-related tourism has brought to Patagonia." (https://patagoniaregionaltimes.org/how-spirit-world-100-went-this-year-and-where-its-going-next/)

**Event Evolution:** "I think what we set out to do originally with this event was to set up an atmosphere where any type of rider would feel comfortable attending. And that's continued. I think the bulk of our registered riders are people looking to have a good time—they don't necessarily take racing seriously, but they're challenging themselves." (https://patagoniaregionaltimes.org/how-spirit-world-100-went-this-year-and-where-its-going-next/)

**Support Services:** Local bike shop Patagonia Bikes (proprietor Noe Mencias) had 5 staff total "doing everything from fixing and maintaining people's bikes, to installing new tires or new parts that those people brought that they wanted to put on their bikes, to selling merchandise, to sharing local and regional resources such as routes and details as to like where to go, where to eat, where to have a good time. So he's definitely like mostly a bike shop, but also an information booth. And then he just recently opened up his new cafe espresso bar, which is called Visitor's Coffee."
