# SPOTTED HORSE ULTRA — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Adrienne Taren [UNKNOWN]:** "The most appropriate way to start talking about this year's (and my first) Spotted Horse Gravel Ultra is perhaps by talking about the aftermath. In the retelling and out-loud processing of all the cold, the mud, the rain, the hills, the several sets of plastic grocery bags attached to appendages, the most common question in response is: Why? Why did you do this? (undertone: what's wrong with you?)" (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2018-spotted-horse-gravel-ultra-the-wet-edition-by-adrienne-taren/)

**Adrienne Taren [UNKNOWN]:** "I have distilled what amounted to 16+ hours of Types 1 through 3 but mostly #2 Fun into nine handy-dandy take-home points for those contemplating any sort of gravel ultra, but especially the Iowa type." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2018-spotted-horse-gravel-ultra-the-wet-edition-by-adrienne-taren/)

**Kate Geisen [ELITE]:** "Sarah Cooper first hit my radar when she won Odin's Revenge in 2014, coming in first overall. I've casually followed her career since that point, and she quickly moved into the Ezster Horanyi / Lael Wilcox / Jill Homer pantheon of heroes/role models/girl-I-most-want-to-be-like-when-I grow-up-except-I'm-already-older-than-them-all." (http://kate-my-mind.blogspot.com/2016/11/spotted-horse-150.html)

**Kate Geisen [ELITE]:** "Unlike races like Motherlode or Dirty Kanza, Spotted Horse was unsupported. Instead of crew meeting us at specified points with food, water, or necessary gear, we were routed past several convenience stores (at mile 38, 69, 100, and 138, I think) where we could refill water and purchase whatever we needed. Anything we couldn't buy at a Casey's had to be carried with us. This made things weirdly easy. No bags to organize, no instructions for crew, just you and the C-store shelves." (http://kate-my-mind.blogspot.com/2016/11/spotted-horse-150.html)

**Kate Geisen [ELITE]:** "Having parked between Steve Fuller and the Stillers, I had the chance to drool over Steve's new(ish) Cutthroat before rolling over to the start line." About readying for the start: "I had surgical gloves on my hands inside Pogie Lites, and my hands were functional. Hands and feet are my kryptonite." (http://kate-my-mind.blogspot.com/2016/11/spotted-horse-150.html)

**Kate Geisen [ELITE]:** On Iowa gravel: "Iowa gravel, at least the roads I've ridden in the two Iowa races I've done, is a lot different from Missouri gravel. The roads were well-packed and smooth, absent potholes and with very little washboarding." (http://kate-my-mind.blogspot.com/2016/11/spotted-horse-150.html)

**Kate Geisen [ELITE]:** "The combination of B roads and a rainy weather forecast gave Sarah some grief in the lead-up to the race... Half facetious and half true. I was both relieved (because, let's face it, 150 miles was going to take me long enough without slogging my not-featherweight bike through mud) and slightly disappointed that the weather forecast moderated itself. The dirt roads ended up being in fantastic shape, well-packed and relatively smooth." (http://kate-my-mind.blogspot.com/2016/11/spotted-horse-150.html)

**HP Ultra Cycling blogger [ELITE]:** "SHGU even in good weather poses a significant challenge to all those willing to toe the line." Describing 2017: "I mistakenly rolled my bike through an almost B road until the drivetrain was so glommed with mud it became nearly unrideable. A farmer gave me the pen in his car to scrape mud which I carried the entire race. I was so hypothermic in Afton that I couldn't do simple math with the Casey's clerk." (https://www.hpultracycling.com/spotted-horse-gravel-ultra-shgu-2019/)

**HP Ultra Cycling blogger [ELITE]:** About 2018: "What I wasn't ready for was the watt-sucking mushy gravel and the insane amount of time that would be spent hiking my bike through the muddy B roads. At least this time, I had daisy chain to carry my bike and a spatula to clean off all the mud." (https://www.hpultracycling.com/spotted-horse-gravel-ultra-shgu-2019/)

**HP Ultra Cycling blogger [ELITE]:** "After spending over an hour hiking my bike and knowing there was more hiking to do on the 200-mile course, I made the decision to switch to the 150-mile race. It was going to be incredibly tight for me to finish the 200 miles in the allotted time and I didn't want a DNF. I had a fantastic finish as the first female finisher of the 150-mile version and third overall for 150 miles." (https://www.hpultracycling.com/spotted-horse-gravel-ultra-shgu-2019/)

**Scott [COMPETITIVE]:** "I had not been riding much long distance since Gravel Worlds in late August as cyclocross season started the week after, so my training rides have been 30 minutes to an hour for the last month. I think long distance riding helps my cross endurance, but cyclocross does not help my long distance endurance." (https://www.bikeiowa.com/Review/1709/spotted-horse-gravel-ultra-race-recap)

**Scott [COMPETITIVE]:** On navigation error: "Nine miles later, I saw the 'Big Picture'. Mr. Garmin was telling me to get into Highway 92... I had kinda questioned my self a few miles sooner if I was on the right route... the screw-up cost me 2.5 hours." (https://www.bikeiowa.com/Review/1709/spotted-horse-gravel-ultra-race-recap)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Adrienne Taren [UNKNOWN]:** Used "a magical GoreTex rain jacket" and "surgical gloves on my hands inside Pogie Lites, and my hands were functional" for the 2018 wet edition. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2018-spotted-horse-gravel-ultra-the-wet-edition-by-adrienne-taren/)

**Adrienne Taren [UNKNOWN]:** "I had no cable" for her Garmin after switching to external battery. Lesson: "For maximal difficulty, leave your Garmin charge cable on top of your car. Also, don't bring any sort of real cue sheet holder." Her improvised cue sheet storage in rank order: "Leg of bib shorts, Stuffed down top of jacket, Sports bra, Wet jersey pocket under rain coat, Teeth, Ditch, Top tube bag (obscures food, entirely unacceptable, food is great)." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2018-spotted-horse-gravel-ultra-the-wet-edition-by-adrienne-taren/)

**Adrienne Taren [UNKNOWN]:** "Plastic bags, butter toffee, and a shot of Fireball will solve approximately 30 miles worth of problems." Also tied "plastic grocery bags over my shoes" after shoe covers failed. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2018-spotted-horse-gravel-ultra-the-wet-edition-by-adrienne-taren/)

**Kate Geisen [ELITE]:** "I had a 100 oz water bladder in a frame bag, keeping the weight off my back" along with "two bottles and carried baggies of Perpetuem for refills." (http://kate-my-mind.blogspot.com/2016/11/spotted-horse-150.html)

**Kate Geisen [ELITE]:** About bike choice: "I was both relieved (because, let's face it, 150 miles was going to take me long enough without slogging my not-featherweight bike through mud)" - acknowledges her bike wasn't the lightest option. (http://kate-my-mind.blogspot.com/2016/11/spotted-horse-150.html)

**HP Ultra Cycling blogger [ELITE]:** "At least this time, I had daisy chain to carry my bike and a spatula to clean off all the mud" for 2018. (https://www.hpultracycling.com/spotted-horse-gravel-ultra-shgu-2019/)

**HP Ultra Cycling blogger [ELITE]:** For 2019: "With a Dynohub, Sinewave Beacon, and external charge brick, lighting was secured for hours of racing. I packed enough food to fuel me for 20 hours of racing." (https://www.hpultracycling.com/spotted-horse-gravel-ultra-shgu-2019/)

**Scott [COMPETITIVE]:** "I've been racing the same (fat) bike for a few years now and have the bike and gear dialed in pretty well for all sorts of conditions." On B roads: "I got to the Level B roads and was able to ride probably more than most since I was on a fat bike. After the first mile of Level B road... 3 (or maybe 5) miles of Level Bs and I was able to ride maybe 3/4 of a mile." (https://www.bikeiowa.com/Review/1709/spotted-horse-gravel-ultra-race-recap)

**Scott [COMPETITIVE]:** On GPS settings: "I have my GPS set to a .5 mile window. This way I can see the turns and watch the curves in the road... The first thing I did was to turn OFF the 'recalculate route' option." (https://www.bikeiowa.com/Review/1709/spotted-horse-gravel-ultra-race-recap)

**From race photo [UNKNOWN]:** One rider described as having "a fat bike" that "was a fat bike" before hitting B-road mud, suggesting even fat bikes struggled in the worst conditions. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2018-spotted-horse-gravel-ultra-the-wet-edition-by-adrienne-taren/)

## Weather Experienced

**2018 Edition (The Wet Edition):** Adrienne Taren [UNKNOWN] reported: "I'm sure it wasn't actually this abrupt, but at the time it seemed that the second I hit the Iowa border, the rain-pocalypse broke loose. Also, the temperature dropped 20-some degrees." Race morning: "I set my alarm for a little before 4am, and was awoken around then anyway by the creep of water onto my sleeping pad. I was frankly impressed that that was all there was. Tiny REI one person tent, we've had a nice run. The important point here was that it was still raining." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2018-spotted-horse-gravel-ultra-the-wet-edition-by-adrienne-taren/)

**2018 results summary:** "Saturday, October 6, 2018. 104 registered. 88 were expected at check-in. 57 started. 22 finished the 150 mile sprint. Only 4 finished the 200 mile." (https://spottedhorsecycling.com/results/)

**2016 Edition:** Kate Geisen [ELITE] noted "The morning was cool, but the forecast called for a rise into the mid 70's before dropping again. With relatively mild temps and no rain expected, I limited my extra gear to a buff and arm warmers." (http://kate-my-mind.blogspot.com/2016/11/spotted-horse-150.html)

**2019 Edition:** HP Ultra Cycling [ELITE]: "Temperatures were due to be in the 50's, so I couldn't complain about that. Things were looking up! My coach... gave me the opportunity to make a race plan... Since SHGU has the reputation of rain and mud, it was only reasonable that rain was on the menu….again!" Race morning: "Race start was delayed for 40 minutes due to the thunderstorm that was just overhead, lightning included... I decided I'd roll out anyway and be ready to find a barn." (https://www.hpultracycling.com/spotted-horse-gravel-ultra-shgu-2019/)

**2019 results summary:** "60 riders took the start after waiting 40 minutes for a line of thunderstorms with lightning to pass. 10 riders finished the 200 mile; 3 women, 7 men. 32 riders finished the 150 mile; 6 women, 26 men." (https://spottedhorsecycling.com/results/)

**2022:** "Unseasonably warm temperatures ranged between 55 and 82. Winds were out of the SW at 12 – 22 MPH, gusting to 30. Road conditions were dry and extremely dusty." (https://spottedhorsecycling.com/results/)

**2023:** "Beautiful fall day, with peak leaf season occurring and temps between 52 and 70. Winds out of the NW at 5 – 22 MPH, gusting to 30. Road conditions were dry and extremely dusty." (https://spottedhorsecycling.com/results/)

**Scott [COMPETITIVE] on 2018:** "The 6:00 am race started in a light drizzle that got heavier up until the 1st checkpoint in Orient at 59 miles. It would rain off and on for the race duration. It rained in the Winterset area all last week and some heavier rains on Friday already forced a couple of re-routes before the race started." (https://www.bikeiowa.com/Review/1709/spotted-horse-gravel-ultra-race-recap)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Kate Geisen [ELITE]:** "After an early climb the next 5 miles or so leveled out... Not long after a big descent, though, E.J.'s rear shifter basically fell off." Described encountering "a virtual gravel wall" with timestamp 7:13 a.m., noting "I was pretty excited to make it to the top without having to walk." (http://kate-my-mind.blogspot.com/2016/11/spotted-horse-150.html)

**Kate Geisen [ELITE]:** On the B roads (dirt/minimum maintenance roads): "Spotted Horse also featured miles of dirt roads, also called 'B roads' or 'minimum maintenance roads'. At one point I also spotted a sign for a C road... The combination of B roads and a rainy weather forecast gave Sarah some grief in the lead-up to the race... The dirt roads ended up being in fantastic shape, well-packed and relatively smooth. They were a nice change of pace and a real highlight of the race." (http://kate-my-mind.blogspot.com/2016/11/spotted-horse-150.html)

**Adrienne Taren [UNKNOWN]:** "For the record, the Race Director had changed the course to route us around the vast majority of the B-roads in the original course (as well as one water crossing that had changed to rapids), but there were a few miles that she could not get around, and we were forewarned." On B-road encounters: "I knew I was there when I rolled up to an intersection. Before I even saw the stretch of mud ahead of me, I saw a muddy gentleman poking at his very, very muddy bike with a stick. 'Is that a fat bike?' I said. 'It was a fat bike,' he said." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2018-spotted-horse-gravel-ultra-the-wet-edition-by-adrienne-taren/)

**Adrienne Taren [UNKNOWN]:** "Congratulations, you've made it through the last 2 or 3 or 17 miles of hiking ankle-deep mud, you're shaking with cold, there's a smiley volunteer with hot chocolate and a gallon of water to wash your bike off with at the bottom of the hill, and you're informed that there are no more B-roads until checkpoint 2! BELIEVE NOTHING. Most likely you will ride away happy-shivering, crest the next hill, and promptly hit hike-a-bike mud again." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2018-spotted-horse-gravel-ultra-the-wet-edition-by-adrienne-taren/)

**Scott [COMPETITIVE]:** "I got to the Level B roads and was able to ride probably more than most since I was on a fat bike. After the first mile of Level B road, I saw the cross-road thinking 'whew - it's over', but then looked down at the GPS and noticed we were going straight again.. right into another Level B. Same for the next cross-road too. So 3 (or maybe 5) miles of Level Bs and I was able to ride maybe 3/4 of a mile. Some stretched had ditches that was walkable/rideable, the next did not." (https://www.bikeiowa.com/Review/1709/spotted-horse-gravel-ultra-race-recap)

**Scott [COMPETITIVE]:** "The 2nd section, I came up on a 'walker' on the other side of the road, stopped with a stick cleaning his bike." And later: "On the 3rd section, I see 3 more 'walkers'. It was Rose, Joselyn and Greg." (https://www.bikeiowa.com/Review/1709/spotted-horse-gravel-ultra-race-recap)

**Scott [COMPETITIVE]:** On the final stretch: "30 miles doesn't sound like much, but it is still a 3 hour window in the dark at a 10mpg avg with semi-moist clothes and 150 miles on your legs already... Lots of rollers and twisties in the last stretch to keep your mind sharp. Wildlife was plentiful too. I saw too many deer, rabbits, raccoon, possum and a few cats in this dark-thirty stretch." (https://www.bikeiowa.com/Review/1709/spotted-horse-gravel-ultra-race-recap)

**Scott [COMPETITIVE]:** "One good thing about riding at night is that you really cannot see how big the hills are. Some I was careening down at 30 mph and others I was climbing at 2mph which is a feat of itself just to keep balance at 2mph." (https://www.bikeiowa.com/Review/1709/spotted-horse-gravel-ultra-race-recap)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Kate Geisen [ELITE]:** "I would use six 500-calorie bottles of Perpetuem (I had two bottles and carried baggies of Perpetuem for refills) and bring along some GUs and a couple candy bars to supplement, buying anything that caught my eye at the C-stores." For a 150-mile finish, she supplemented with "a piece of pizza, a second breakfast to complement the cinnamon roll I'd picked up at a different Casey's early that morning." (http://kate-my-mind.blogspot.com/2016/11/spotted-horse-150.html)

**Kate Geisen [ELITE]:** "About 4 hours in we stopped at the mile 38 Casey's to rest and resupply. While I wouldn't have stopped on my own, it was a nice break. I supplemented my on-bike nutrition with a piece of pizza... After a 20-minute break we hopped back onto the bikes." (http://kate-my-mind.blogspot.com/2016/11/spotted-horse-150.html)

**HP Ultra Cycling [ELITE]:** For 2019 200-mile attempt: "My coach, Greg Grandgeorge, gave me the opportunity to make a race plan on my own with a little oversight. That went ok, but even before critique, I noted that my power numbers were likely a little low." Primary goal: "to finish the 200-mile course no matter what. I packed enough food to fuel me for 20 hours of racing." (https://www.hpultracycling.com/spotted-horse-gravel-ultra-shgu-2019/)

**HP Ultra Cycling [ELITE]:** About pacing with lead group: "Shortly after the start, I could hear the happy rumble of fat tires as Brad Stoermer and Jenn Borst joined me for a bit. I enjoyed the company. However, I was eager to get to Lorimor as quickly as possible with the impending weather and eventually pulled away." (https://www.hpultracycling.com/spotted-horse-gravel-ultra-shgu-2019/)

**Scott [COMPETITIVE]:** "It always takes me 35-45 miles for my legs to get into the groove and by mile 35, I knew it was going to be a struggle to keep up with my normal pack and pack. I ate a good breakfast.. OK, it was 1/2 of a Panchero's chicken burrito, a banana and a Gatorade. I call it a good breakfast and it usually sustains me. I was 20 miles in and started to have hunger twangs, so an RX bar to the rescue followed by a salted nut roll 10 miles later." (https://www.bikeiowa.com/Review/1709/spotted-horse-gravel-ultra-race-recap)

**Scott [COMPETITIVE]:** At CP1 (mile 59): "I arrived on fumes. Check in. Fill water bladder. Use the facilities and eat. I went with my old stand-by of a can of Campbell's Chicken Noodle Soup, a small can of Pringles, a piece of beef jerky and a Mountain Dew. I probably should have eaten more." (https://www.bikeiowa.com/Review/1709/spotted-horse-gravel-ultra-race-recap)

**Scott [COMPETITIVE]:** At Murray Casey's (mile ~150): "Pizza or Chicken Noodle Soup didn't sound that good and the deli area was closed, so I pleaded with the lady to make a fresh double-turkey wrap (which she did - THANK YOU!). I had a set-down meal there... After supper, I filled my water-bladder and assessed my food for the last 30 miles. It's always a challenge not to buy a bunch of sugary snacks to take with. I held back as I had enough food already on the bike to get me by." Left at 9:44pm. (https://www.bikeiowa.com/Review/1709/spotted-horse-gravel-ultra-race-recap)

**Scott [COMPETITIVE]:** Final 30 miles pacing: "I started to playing mental games with myself to see if I could shave off some minutes each of the 3 hours by pushing my pace. The first 10 miles was exactly an hour. The 2nd 10 miles was 61 minutes and the last 10 miles was 59 minutes, so 3 hours for the win." This suggests approximately 10 mph average over the final 30 miles at night. (https://www.bikeiowa.com/Review/1709/spotted-horse-gravel-ultra-race-recap)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Scott [COMPETITIVE]:** "By Checkpoint #1, the race had already claimed a few derailleurs and hypothermic conditions forced many others to drop from the race. The final results are not up yet, but only 3 people finished the 200 miler, and 30-40 finished the 150. Maybe 60-70 started?" (https://www.bikeiowa.com/Review/1709/spotted-horse-gravel-ultra-race-recap)

**2018 attrition:** "104 registered. 88 were expected at check-in. 57 started. 22 finished the 150 mile sprint. Only 4 finished the 200 mile." (https://spottedhorsecycling.com/results/)

**HP Ultra Cycling [ELITE]:** "After spending over an hour hiking my bike and knowing there was more hiking to do on the 200-mile course, I made the decision to switch to the 150-mile race. It was going to be incredibly tight for me to finish the 200 miles in the allotted time and I didn't want a DNF." (https://www.hpultracycling.com/spotted-horse-gravel-ultra-shgu-2019/)

**Kate Geisen [ELITE]:** About her riding partner: "EJ was wearing down a little, but one of his superpowers is stubbornness and the ability to, despite lack of training, accomplish much more than you might expect... at the top of one of these he told me, 'I know this isn't what you wanted to hear, but I'm not doing this whole thing.'" They hit CP1 at mile 52, and he dropped. (http://kate-my-mind.blogspot.com/2016/11/spotted-horse-150.html)

**Scott [COMPETITIVE]:** Navigation errors as a DNF risk: His wrong turn and recalculation cost him "2.5 hours" and he notes "In hindsight, I should have double-checked the cue cards against the GPS after the re-calculation in Orient. I've never had my GPS recalculate like that before. It always recalculated to the course, not the end." (https://www.bikeiowa.com/Review/1709/spotted-horse-gravel-ultra-race-recap)

**Adrienne Taren [UNKNOWN]:** Multiple racers encountered bike-stopping mud. One rider with a fat bike was "poking at his very, very muddy bike with a stick." The lesson: "There is a fine line between 'bike that will give me the best shot at riding through the mud-pocalypse' and 'bike that will be very difficult to carry if can't ride through the mud-pocalypse.'" (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2018-spotted-horse-gravel-ultra-the-wet-edition-by-adrienne-taren/)

**Scott [COMPETITIVE]:** At CP2: "Check in. Dropped from 200 to 150 (along with almost everyone else). The reality was I would never make the 2am cut off if I attempted the full 200. I was already WAY behind and had already ridden an extra 30 miles and my legs were pretty fatigued." (https://www.bikeiowa.com/Review/1709/spotted-horse-gravel-ultra-race-recap)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Adrienne Taren [UNKNOWN]:** On pre-race camping: "On Friday evening, I found myself driving north from Oklahoma... After the appropriate amount of swearing at iPhone Maps, I found Sarah Cooper's house (appropriately off a gravel road), where she was graciously allowing racers to camp on the extensive front lawn. I bonded with the handful of other crazy people there over bicycles and whether or not we were going to die in a thunderstorm overnight... It was quite pleasant, and I would happily almost be flooded out of my tent with these people again." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2018-spotted-horse-gravel-ultra-the-wet-edition-by-adrienne-taren/)

**Adrienne Taren [UNKNOWN]:** On volunteer support: "Late-morning, cresting a hill, there were a couple of volunteers roadside with Fireball and Reese's cups. Perfectly normal to have a friendly stranger stick a Reese's inside your mouth for you because your hands are too filthy, by the way." Also at checkpoint: "Congratulations, you've made it through the last 2 or 3 or 17 miles of hiking ankle-deep mud, you're shaking with cold, there's a smiley volunteer with hot chocolate and a gallon of water to wash your bike off with." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2018-spotted-horse-gravel-ultra-the-wet-edition-by-adrienne-taren/)

**Kate Geisen [ELITE]:** About the race director: "Sarah Cooper first hit my radar when she won Odin's Revenge in 2014, coming in first overall... Sarah has a special place in my heart because she achieves all her accomplishments while also being the mother of four; meanwhile, most days I can barely get my hair combed in time to drop off my one remaining kid at home and rush into work 30 seconds before I'm supposed to be there. I finally got to meet her in person at last year's 24 11 Hours of Cumming, where she crushed the women's field." (http://kate-my-mind.blogspot.com/2016/11/spotted-horse-150.html)

**Kate Geisen [ELITE]:** "Not being a regular to the Iowa gravel scene, I saw few familiar faces. Having parked between Steve Fuller and the Stillers, I had the chance to drool over Steve's new(ish) Cutthroat before rolling over to the start line. There, I said hi to Jacob and then ended up next to my St. Louis area friends (and all-around awesome people), Carrie and Jeff Sona." (http://kate-my-mind.blogspot.com/2016/11/spotted-horse-150.html)

**HP Ultra Cycling [ELITE]:** About the race director and motivation: "When one of your heroes organizes a long race on her training ground, you pay attention; as soon as Sarah announced the inaugural Spotted Horse Gravel Ultra I penciled it onto my race schedule." And reflecting on 2018: "I felt sheepish presenting myself to the race director with what I felt to be a bit of failure. I felt I could have and should have performed better." (https://www.hpultracycling.com/spotted-horse-gravel-ultra-shgu-2019/)

**HP Ultra Cycling [ELITE]:** "Shortly after the start, I could hear the happy rumble of fat tires as Brad Stoermer and Jenn Borst joined me for a bit. I enjoyed the company." (https://www.hpultracycling.com/spotted-horse-gravel-ultra-shgu-2019/)

**Scott [COMPETITIVE]:** "I chatted with people, got my packet and violated my own personal rule of no alcohol pre-race with a little wine-tasting. I chatted with winery owner, Doug, and left with a few bottles of delightful wine and a tasty port." At Murray: "Newbs (Scott Newbury - one of the race volunteers and good friend) walked in and we chatted while I ate. After supper, I filled my water-bladder... Newbs also sent her a text when I left Murray." (https://www.bikeiowa.com/Review/1709/spotted-horse-gravel-ultra-race-recap)

**Scott [COMPETITIVE]:** On friendly dogs: "I had 2 friendly farm dogs follow me at different times during the day. Both followed for 5-7 miles and they were having a ball. I thought I'd lose them on the down hills, but they'd catch me on the up hills. One even followed me though a town and across highway 34. they were fun to watch as this was probably the most exciting time they had in a while. they were having a ball running full-tilt beside me. I hope they both found their way back home." (https://www.bikeiowa.com/Review/1709/spotted-horse-gravel-ultra-race-recap)
