# SPRING THAW — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Ray George [UNKNOWN]:** The 10th Annual Great Big Spring Thaw Ride had "25+ show up for a rainy start. As we waited for the rain to move on, we enjoyed coffee from Brioso Coffee, pancakes served up by Andi from Kenda Tires, and checked out the Spring Thaw Sourdough from The Bread Pirate Roberts. Andi also surprised everyone with Kenda tires or tubes." (https://www.ohiogravelgrinders.com/blog/2025/3/30/recap-10th-annual-great-big-spring-thaw-ride)

The event had mechanical support from Paradise Garage and featured community sponsors providing food and gear. After the ride, the group regathered at a shelter. The atmosphere appears casual and supportive, with organizers searching for and rescuing riders who went off-route.

## Weather Experienced

**2025 Event [UNKNOWN]:** "rainy start" with "light showers" returning on the first climb. Despite the rain, conditions were manageable for riding. (https://www.ohiogravelgrinders.com/blog/2025/3/30/recap-10th-annual-great-big-spring-thaw-ride)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Ray George [UNKNOWN]:** "Scioto Trail SP drains well, so for the most part, we had gravel spray but no muddy sections." The route includes climbs early in the ride where the group naturally broke into smaller packs. The terrain allowed riders to drain well despite rainy conditions.

## DNF Risk Factors

**Ray George [UNKNOWN]:** Navigation issues occurred — "two of the riders were still out on the route. After some searching, we rescued Julia Wu and another rider who had gone off route. They welcomed a lift back to the start." Going off-route appears to be a risk factor, suggesting clear navigation tools are important.

**Ray George [UNKNOWN]:** Handed out "samples of Tom Wilson's Scioto TSP28 route printed on waterproof paper" — suggesting riders may need physical navigation backup in addition to GPS devices. (https://www.ohiogravelgrinders.com/blog/2025/3/30/recap-10th-annual-great-big-spring-thaw-ride)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Ray George [UNKNOWN]:** Waterproof route maps were provided to riders, suggesting this is useful equipment for the conditions. Kenda provided tires or tubes to participants, though specific tire models aren't mentioned. (https://www.ohiogravelgrinders.com/blog/2025/3/30/recap-10th-annual-great-big-spring-thaw-ride)
