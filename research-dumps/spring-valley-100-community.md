# SPRING VALLEY 100 — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Nicholas Garbis [COMPETITIVE]:** "I had a plan, and as per normal I fully expected some three to ten things to go wrong with it. If nothing goes wrong, then there's nothing to write about (you'd think!) so I don't exactly tempt things to go wrong, but I don't exactly guard too much against them either." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2018-almanzo-100-spring-valley-minnesota-by-nicholas-garbis/)

**Nicholas Garbis [COMPETITIVE]:** "For the first 10 miles, I was averaging 22mph — that was quite a bit hot and I knew it. I was hoping to find a group that was forming and finally, I did around mile 15 or so. Still moving along quickly — at mile 18 average was just under 20mph and we were holding speeds near 25mph." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2018-almanzo-100-spring-valley-minnesota-by-nicholas-garbis/)

**Nicholas Garbis [COMPETITIVE]:** "After taking four hours to make the 40mi to Preston, Sullivan and I were shredded (and we had a support vehicle), so we looked at each other and spoke the words that had been thought but not spoken for three hours — 'I'm done.'" [referring to 2017 race in 37F rain and wind] (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2018-almanzo-100-spring-valley-minnesota-by-nicholas-garbis/)

**Nicholas Garbis [COMPETITIVE]:** "This year was in June, yesterday, June 5th, and temps were in the 90s with winds gusting up to 25mph... The weather forecast was for low 90s and high winds. Definitely, a tough day to be on a bike for 6-10hrs. I think I heard later that 350 had registered and 150 had shown up for the event." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2021-spring-valley-almanzo-100-meteor-theory-vs-heat-wave-gravel-vs-skin/)

**Casey Matthews [UNKNOWN]:** "Single speed is right," [when asked about riding the hills with a 42-18 gear combination] (https://www.cxmagazine.com/gravel-bikes-waltworks-all-city-specialized-2018-almanzo-100)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Casey Matthews [UNKNOWN]** ran a single speed with 42-18 gearing on an All-City Nature Boy Zona frame with flat bars and road calipers. He stated "Single speed is right" when discussing the southeast Minnesota hills. (https://www.cxmagazine.com/gravel-bikes-waltworks-all-city-specialized-2018-almanzo-100)

**Nicholas Garbis [COMPETITIVE]** mentioned tire pressure at "precisely 38.7 (probably a bit too high)" for the 2021 edition. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2021-spring-valley-almanzo-100-meteor-theory-vs-heat-wave-gravel-vs-skin/)

All-City Cycles bikes were notably popular at the event, with many riders using the Minneapolis-based company's steel gravel/adventure frames. (https://www.cxmagazine.com/gravel-bikes-waltworks-all-city-specialized-2018-almanzo-100)

## Weather Experienced

**2018:** Warm and calm with soft cloud cover. Nicholas Garbis [COMPETITIVE] noted: "For this year's running, we had weather that has only come once previously to this event that I know of — warm and calm with a soft cover of clouds." Ideal conditions that allowed for PR attempts. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2018-almanzo-100-spring-valley-minnesota-by-nicholas-garbis/)

**2017:** 37F with rain and wind. Nicholas Garbis [COMPETITIVE] described taking four hours to reach Preston (40 miles) on a fat bike with 4-inch tires that stuck to "peanut-butter roads." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2018-almanzo-100-spring-valley-minnesota-by-nicholas-garbis/)

**2011:** Temperature dropped to 39F with rain starting on the way back to Spring Valley. Riders finished "crusted over with grey gravel from head to toe" in approximately 10:30. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2018-almanzo-100-spring-valley-minnesota-by-nicholas-garbis/)

**2021:** Low 90s with winds gusting up to 25mph. Heat caused significant attrition - 350 registered but only 150 showed up. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2021-spring-valley-almanzo-100-meteor-theory-vs-heat-wave-gravel-vs-skin/)

**General pattern:** Nicholas Garbis [COMPETITIVE] noted the weather "had varied from the 30s to the 80s, cold rain to hot sun, mostly wind, and sometimes calm." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2021-spring-valley-almanzo-100-meteor-theory-vs-heat-wave-gravel-vs-skin/)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Nicholas Garbis [COMPETITIVE]:** "The land on either side of the Mississippi in this area, once you are above the bluff line, is wrinkled and rolling where streams and creeks have dug their paths, leaving high grounds, natural quarries, and rolling vistas of green lushness... downhills that cross a flowing creek and turn back up toward the trees." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2018-almanzo-100-spring-valley-minnesota-by-nicholas-garbis/)

**Nicholas Garbis [COMPETITIVE]:** "I know the final stretch into Preston along the river — a canopy of freshly leaved trees. As it dips down and to the right, it crosses the river, and rises slightly before you see people's support cars lined up on either side." [Preston is at mile 40] (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2018-almanzo-100-spring-valley-minnesota-by-nicholas-garbis/)

**Nicholas Garbis [COMPETITIVE]:** "Preston, like most towns in the area, is on a river. The South Branch of the Root River in this case. The course follows the river into the valley in the covered coolness of the forest. Then there's a bridge and you roll in toward town. It's a familiar pattern that repeats itself dozens of times on the course: downhill, valley, river, bridge, then uphill, open rolling plateau of farmland, downhill, etc." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2021-spring-valley-almanzo-100-meteor-theory-vs-heat-wave-gravel-vs-skin/)

**Nicholas Garbis [COMPETITIVE]** mentions "the soul-breaking Oriole Road at mile 91" as a notable climb. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2021-spring-valley-almanzo-100-meteor-theory-vs-heat-wave-gravel-vs-skin/)

The 2018 race featured "gravel was fast and hard-packed" with tailwind sections in the early miles. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2018-almanzo-100-spring-valley-minnesota-by-nicholas-garbis/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Nicholas Garbis [COMPETITIVE]** employed a "Meteor Theory" - "a plan to go out hot, hotter than what can be sustained, and then slowly peel back — like the edges of a meteor burning off as it enters the Earth's atmosphere. Decreasing speed, increasing suffering the whole way, and hoping that the body only turns to ash as the finish line comes into sight." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2021-spring-valley-almanzo-100-meteor-theory-vs-heat-wave-gravel-vs-skin/)

**Nicholas Garbis [COMPETITIVE]:** In 2018 ideal conditions, he averaged 22mph for the first 10 miles (noted as "quite a bit hot"), then settled into a group averaging just under 20mph at mile 18 with speeds near 25mph. He reached Preston (mile 40) in about 2:06 and finished with a PR of approximately 6:18 for 100 miles. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2018-almanzo-100-spring-valley-minnesota-by-nicholas-garbis/)

**Nicholas Garbis [COMPETITIVE]:** In 2021's extreme heat, the lead group of about 15 riders held "a moderate pace, probably knocking down 20mph average with some tailwind. Nothing extreme, and nobody really pushing too hard. Everyone was playing things a bit safe. There was no PR happening today." Arrived at Preston in 2:06. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2021-spring-valley-almanzo-100-meteor-theory-vs-heat-wave-gravel-vs-skin/)

**Nicholas Garbis [COMPETITIVE]** on Preston stop (mile 40): "I apologized as I required 5 bottles to get my three water bottles and my belly topped off. I ate a pickle wrapped in salami, said thank you, and rolled away." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2021-spring-valley-almanzo-100-meteor-theory-vs-heat-wave-gravel-vs-skin/)

Group dynamics are critical in the early sections. Nicholas Garbis [COMPETITIVE] noted attempting to "ride with the first group and then fall backward as the protests of the legs and heart grew too loud" but this required "a surge effort in the first five minutes, racing up through the crowd." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2018-almanzo-100-spring-valley-minnesota-by-nicholas-garbis/)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Extreme weather conditions:** The 2017 edition saw Nicholas Garbis [COMPETITIVE] DNF at Preston (mile 40) after 4 hours in 37F rain and wind on a fat bike: "After taking four hours to make the 40mi to Preston, Sullivan and I were shredded (and we had a support vehicle), so we looked at each other and spoke the words that had been thought but not spoken for three hours — 'I'm done.'" (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2018-almanzo-100-spring-valley-minnesota-by-nicholas-garbis/)

**Heat attrition:** In 2021 with low 90s temps and high winds, "350 had registered and 150 had shown up for the event" - suggesting many pre-registered riders chose not to start based on conditions. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2021-spring-valley-almanzo-100-meteor-theory-vs-heat-wave-gravel-vs-skin/)

**Navigation challenges:** Nicholas Garbis [COMPETITIVE] noted increased risk in 2021 due to smaller field: "Getting lost in 'no man's land' in between groups of riders was now more than a lonely ride, unprotected from the wind, it was a near guarantee for getting lost and adding miles on a day that was already setting up to be dangerously hot." He had to phone a friend to get GPS route loaded at mile 43. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2021-spring-valley-almanzo-100-meteor-theory-vs-heat-wave-gravel-vs-skin/)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Nicholas Garbis [COMPETITIVE]:** "It was electrifying to be back in that grassy lot with everyone prepping their stuff and nervously bantering. There were a lot of CRo-designed kits from the Day Across Minnesota (DAMn) and the Filthy 50 amongst the group." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2021-spring-valley-almanzo-100-meteor-theory-vs-heat-wave-gravel-vs-skin/)

Pre-race breakfast tradition at Tarsilla's in Stewartville with "A group of Gravelleras & Gravelleros" featuring regular participants including one rider (Dan G.) who "has sworn since the first time he rode gravel that he would never do it again, and I think he's ridden four Almanzo's since." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2018-almanzo-100-spring-valley-minnesota-by-nicholas-garbis/)

Penn Cycle provided mobile bike support with "water and whiskey" at Preston (mile 40). (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2018-almanzo-100-spring-valley-minnesota-by-nicholas-garbis/)

**Nicholas Garbis [COMPETITIVE]:** "A day on gravel backroads, even riding on two wheels with the technology the day can provide, is a return to a core of joy in the midst of struggle. To persevere and to finish in whatever speed or condition — it's a day-long blessing to the land and the sky." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2018-almanzo-100-spring-valley-minnesota-by-nicholas-garbis/)

Historical context: The race was originally called Almanzo 100, named after Almanzo Wilder who arrived in the area around 1870 and later married Laura Ingalls. "Most certainly, Mr. Almanzo Wilder would have been barely recorded in the history books if not for the literary gifts of his wife." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2018-almanzo-100-spring-valley-minnesota-by-nicholas-garbis/)

The event has undergone name changes - "new name (third name in 3 years)" - including being called "Spring Valley 100" when the city of Spring Valley took over organizing. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2021-spring-valley-almanzo-100-meteor-theory-vs-heat-wave-gravel-vs-skin/)

**Nicholas Garbis [COMPETITIVE]:** "There's hardly a better gravel route to be found — natural beauty, grinding open spaces, epic climbs including the soul-breaking Oriole Road at mile 91. It's a spring gravel classic, so you can expect that the weather is rarely a friend. That's what spring racing is about. You prepare in fear. Fear of not having the legs, fear of the conditions. And on the day, you show up and you get it done." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2021-spring-valley-almanzo-100-meteor-theory-vs-heat-wave-gravel-vs-skin/)
