# STANDARD DELUXE DIRT ROAD CENTURY — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**K-Dogg [ELITE]:** "After a short roll out we were turned loose into another adventure into the amazing Alabama state forests. Slowly the dirt-flecked gaggle picked up speed over the next hilly few miles... The relentless little hills turned into relentless bigger hills and people began burning off the back. After five miles a group of 20 riders congealed and the pace picked up a bit." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2018-standard-deluxe-gravel-race-waverly-alabama/)

**K-Dogg [ELITE]:** "Up and down we cruised comfortably over a few hills and a couple of dry creek wooden bridges... Suddenly somebody stood up and went. A few more followed. The hills got suddenly longer and steeper. The gravel became a dusty red haze with fist sized rocks everywhere. People began to flat." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-k-doggs-take-on-the-standard-deluxe-dirt-road-century/)

**K-Dogg [ELITE]:** "Thirty minutes later we hit a flat stretch of pavement and EVERYBODY suddenly threw it into neutral… down to 10 mph! Snacks were opened. Drinks were drunk. Conversation began. This is weird I thought… weird but I like it! Must be an Auburn thing." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-k-doggs-take-on-the-standard-deluxe-dirt-road-century/)

**K-Dogg [ELITE]:** "I noticed If I conserved a little up the long hills (like I had a choice) a gap would open up but I could marshal enough energy to sprint back on just over the top. None of the four seemed to attack much on the downhill. It only gave an advantage to the drafters as they all appeared to be too blown from the uphill bit. This pattern helped me immensely." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2018-standard-deluxe-gravel-race-waverly-alabama/)

**Todd Sellers [ELITE]:** "Thoroughly enjoyed being out on the course with you, K-dogg. The infinite stream of old man jokes/humor made the day that much more enjoyable... Pete and I attacked that last climb and got away, only to be caught by the 100 miler guys who gave us a nice roll in on the back of their group to the finish line sprint. Fantastic day and great riding by you!" (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2018-standard-deluxe-gravel-race-waverly-alabama/)

**John Schwab [ELITE]:** "I told you I was in tourist mode" he said grinning... Apparently, the wife / girlfriend of the dude on the Fatbike felt bad and unclipped his leash to chase back on." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-k-doggs-take-on-the-standard-deluxe-dirt-road-century/)

**Scott Ewing [ELITE, age 61]:** He "pulled like an animal all day" and took third place approximately 6 minutes back from the leaders in the 2018 edition. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2018-standard-deluxe-gravel-race-waverly-alabama/)

**EmperorSnu [UNKNOWN]:** "After the success of last year's Dirt Road Century, Terra Firma Cycling is back at it again... Like last year, it's recommended that you run a bike with at least 700x35c tires. Cyclocross (with wide tires) or mountain bikes would be preferred. It is also recommended that you bring spare tubes and CO2 with you in the event of a flat. The roads on the route are very rural, and are very chunky, so a standard road bike setup will not be able to complete the route." (https://www.bikeforums.net/southeast-regional-rides-events/1115197-alabama-standard-deluxe-dirt-road-century-october-21st-2017-a.html)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Minimum tire size [ALL LEVELS]:** "It's recommended that you run a bike with at least 700x35c tires. Cyclocross (with wide tires) or mountain bikes would be preferred... a standard road bike setup will not be able to complete the route." (https://www.bikeforums.net/southeast-regional-rides-events/1115197-alabama-standard-deluxe-dirt-road-century-october-21st-2017-a.html)

**Spare equipment [ALL LEVELS]:** "It is also recommended that you bring spare tubes and CO2 with you in the event of a flat." Multiple riders experienced flats during the race. (https://www.bikeforums.net/southeast-regional-rides-events/1115197-alabama-standard-deluxe-dirt-road-century-october-21st-2017-a.html)

**Successful equipment [ELITE]:** John Schwab completed the race on a single speed Fatbike, though the gearing forced him to "attack over and over again" on hills to maintain momentum. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-k-doggs-take-on-the-standard-deluxe-dirt-road-century/)

**Common mechanical issues [ALL LEVELS]:** "The gravel became a dusty red haze with fist sized rocks everywhere. People began to flat." Multiple riders in the lead group experienced punctures during the race. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-k-doggs-take-on-the-standard-deluxe-dirt-road-century/)

## Weather Experienced

**2018 Edition:** "The temperature was nice, the rain light" - light rain and downpours occurred intermittently throughout the race. "The rain became a downpour from time to time but not too bad although my nice white jersey is now permanently pumpkin." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2018-standard-deluxe-gravel-race-waverly-alabama/)

**2016 Edition:** Conditions were dry enough to create "a dusty red haze" from the gravel roads. "Everybody's faces were smeared with so much red dust they looked like irradiated Native Americans." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-k-doggs-take-on-the-standard-deluxe-dirt-road-century/)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Road surface:** "The gravel became a dusty red haze with fist sized rocks everywhere." The gravel is described as "chunky" with "virtually no flat or straight sections. A few smooth sections but still lots of stones and punctures." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-k-doggs-take-on-the-standard-deluxe-dirt-road-century/)

**Hill profile:** "The relentless little hills turned into relentless bigger hills... The pack would bunch up and spread out at hill's bottom then slowly stretch out up to the crest." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2018-standard-deluxe-gravel-race-waverly-alabama/)

**Specific features:** Multiple "dry creek wooden bridges" appear on the course, with at least one described as "rather tricky for some." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-k-doggs-take-on-the-standard-deluxe-dirt-road-century/)

**Pavement sections:** The course includes intermittent flat pavement sections where "EVERYBODY suddenly threw it into neutral… down to 10 mph! Snacks were opened." These sections provide natural recovery opportunities. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-k-doggs-take-on-the-standard-deluxe-dirt-road-century/)

**Steep descents:** At least one turn features "a very steep, off camber, sketchy hill" difficult enough that a rider "forgot to downshift before stopping to turn around. Hard to make a 180 on a 15% slippery hill in the eleven tooth cog." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2018-standard-deluxe-gravel-race-waverly-alabama/)

**Navigation challenges:** "Supposedly the course was marked but few admitted to actually seeing a marker. Perhaps they were the size of Sam's green eggs." However, the 2017 edition promised "A clearly marked course (last year's route wasn't marked well... or really at all)." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-k-doggs-take-on-the-standard-deluxe-dirt-road-century/ and https://www.bikeforums.net/southeast-regional-rides-events/1115197-alabama-standard-deluxe-dirt-road-century-october-21st-2017-a.html)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Early race positioning [ELITE]:** "To ensure a safe and clear horizon, I stayed in the first few rows zigging and zagging, track to track, and mostly keeping away from wind and wacky riders. As usual, the boldly upright mountain bikers seemed to cherish the front. As usual, I gratefully accepted their generosity." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2018-standard-deluxe-gravel-race-waverly-alabama/)

**Critical selection point [ELITE]:** Around 5 miles in, the race made its key selection: "we were suddenly struggling up an extra punchy hill... Suddenly, seven guys were out of the saddle and opening a huge gap. The rest were lethargic... Two hills and one mile later, I bridged up." Missing this move essentially determined the race. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2018-standard-deluxe-gravel-race-waverly-alabama/)

**Yo-yo technique [ELITE, older riders]:** K-Dogg described a survival strategy: "I noticed If I conserved a little up the long hills (like I had a choice) a gap would open up but I could marshal enough energy to sprint back on just over the top. None of the four seemed to attack much on the downhill... This pattern helped me immensely." This allowed him to stay with stronger, younger riders. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2018-standard-deluxe-gravel-race-waverly-alabama/)

**Team tactics [ELITE]:** "With an hour and a half left, Dr. Pain's legs didn't exactly puncture but 'heard the tapping of the drums.' His slow leaking front tire didn't help matters any. He too waved us on... We realized neither Diesel nor I had a working GPS and would be hopelessly lost if we fell behind 'Sam-I-Am'." GPS and navigation become critical when racing in small groups. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-k-doggs-take-on-the-standard-deluxe-dirt-road-century/)

**Attack patterns [ELITE]:** "At some point along here, the foursome began to attack each other in pairs. Scott and Leaky Guy would jump up a hill and force Pete and Todd to chase. Then Pete and Todd would have a go back at them the next hill. The multiple hills and relentless attacks kept taking me off the back like a human yo-yo." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2018-standard-deluxe-gravel-race-waverly-alabama/)

**Aid station strategy [ELITE]:** "At about the mile 40 rest stop (again, nobody stopped) we were down to five." The lead group did not stop at aid stations, though other riders did. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2018-standard-deluxe-gravel-race-waverly-alabama/)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Flatting:** Multiple riders in the lead groups experienced punctures throughout the race. "The gravel became a dusty red haze with fist sized rocks everywhere. People began to flat." One rider in a break was forced to stop "spinning his tire… probably in an effort to coax sealant into a leaky tire" and lost contact with the group. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-k-doggs-take-on-the-standard-deluxe-dirt-road-century/ and https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2018-standard-deluxe-gravel-race-waverly-alabama/)

**Navigation errors:** "Scott, who had no GPS but pulled like an animal all day, overshot a turn down a very steep, off camber, sketchy hill. He later said he forgot to downshift before stopping to turn around." GPS failures left riders dependent on staying with the group. K-Dogg reported getting "a few wrong turns" when riding solo. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2018-standard-deluxe-gravel-race-waverly-alabama/)

**Early selection:** "After five miles a group of 20 riders congealed and the pace picked up a bit... The pack whittled down to 15 due to fatigue and flats." Missing the early break essentially ended podium chances. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2018-standard-deluxe-gravel-race-waverly-alabama/)

**Mechanicals:** JOM "experienced a mechanical issue" and was forced to abandon his race effort, joining "the Gran Fondo train home" instead. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-k-doggs-take-on-the-standard-deluxe-dirt-road-century/)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Pre-race:** "The fifty something rider pack comprising of riders from both distances was gently paced out of town not by a car, but by two guys on bicycles who pulled off to the side once the first bridge was crossed. Eco-friendly escort!" (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-k-doggs-take-on-the-standard-deluxe-dirt-road-century/)

**Gravel vs. road racing culture:** "If this was a 'road race' everyone would curse, spit and demand I drop off the back. But gravel racers are much nicer by definition and they encouraged me to just sit on... Many roadies wouldn't have given honor a thought. Gravel cyclists are better than that." K-Dogg was allowed to sit on without contributing pulls. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2018-standard-deluxe-gravel-race-waverly-alabama/)

**Group dynamics:** "Along one excessively hilly section, Fatbike guy aka Big Fattie seemed to attack over and over again until we realized that's just how single speeds have to work their momentum. 'I hope you realize how hard I am working for you K-Dogg!' said Dr. Pain, drifting back to the laughing group." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-k-doggs-take-on-the-standard-deluxe-dirt-road-century/)

**Neutral sections:** "At some point along here, a big guy on a single speed Fatbike (John Schwab) accompanied by our youngest and sometimes teammate, Brian Rogers, rolled up from behind after chasing for several miles. 'Where the heck you been?' I queried. 'I told you I was in tourist mode' he said grinning – which made no sense. Apparently, the wife / girlfriend of the dude on the Fatbike felt bad and unclipped his leash to chase back on. How nice is that?!" (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-k-doggs-take-on-the-standard-deluxe-dirt-road-century/)

**Post-race:** "Everybody's faces were smeared with so much red dust they looked like irradiated Native Americans. But the delicious beer provided by the Good People Brewing Company quickly erased the day's aches and pains... 1,000 thanks for the promoters, volunteers and riders for a wonderful day of playing with our bikes in the dirt." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-k-doggs-take-on-the-standard-deluxe-dirt-road-century/)

**Venue:** The race is "Held in Waverly, AL, on endless miles of quiet dirt roads, ending at the Standard Deluxe for an afterparty with plenty of food and beverages." The venue is described as a "Cracker shack compound that houses a T-shirt shop and art gallery." (https://www.dirtroadcentury.com and https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-k-doggs-take-on-the-standard-deluxe-dirt-road-century/)

**Race atmosphere:** "This brand new race was promoted by two unbelievably enthusiastic guys, Colt and Mark... Team Gravel Cyclist agreed our experiences there leaned more toward the 'Deluxe', than the 'Standard.'" (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-k-doggs-take-on-the-standard-deluxe-dirt-road-century/)

**2017 improvements:** Promoters added "Free communal camping at Standard Deluxe, Live music at the Little House (located at Standard Deluxe), A clearly marked course (last year's route wasn't marked well... or really at all), Professionally designed T-Shirts available for purchase." (https://www.bikeforums.net/southeast-regional-rides-events/1115197-alabama-standard-deluxe-dirt-road-century-october-21st-2017-a.html)

**Community support:** "The event is brought to you this year by James Bros. Bikes and The Alabama Animal Rescue Resource Foundation... All proceeds generated by this organization goes directly to aid in their mission to help these discarded animals." (https://www.dirtroadcentury.com)
