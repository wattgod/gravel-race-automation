# SBT GRVL — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Ben Brown [COMPETITIVE]:** "The first hour was fucked. (Later, we learned that Keegan had attacked at mile 7, but none of us were anywhere close to the front to bear witness to it.) We had all agreed amongst ourselves that we wouldn't go too deep too early, having come straight from sea level. We weren't sure what the altitude would do to us deeper into the race. That said, in that first hour, you had to go crazy hard just to stay with the group. Our power was barely lower than it would be in a 75-minute crit." (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/sbt-grvl-recap)

**Ben Brown [COMPETITIVE]:** "After the first gravel sector, which lasts about 30 miles, we came out onto the tarmac for a short while before cutting back through a hay field for an impromptu bit of CX. This made for sapping riding and I was worried I was going to rip my derailleur off." (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/sbt-grvl-recap)

**Ben Brown [COMPETITIVE]:** "The first serious climb arrives at around mile 40; it's a 4-mile, 9%, gravel situation that goes from 6.5k to around 9.5k (don't check the math on that.) Matt and I made a pact that we wouldn't go too hard given that there was still 100 miles to go. Even so, we were pleasantly surprised to find that we were one of the first over the top from our group. Cresting the hill, I really did start to notice the altitude 'I'm breathing heavily but it'll pass… ok I'm still breathing heavily… ok STILL…' It was taking me about 10 minutes to finish every bite of Clif bars because I needed to breathe so hard." (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/sbt-grvl-recap)

**Ben Brown [COMPETITIVE]:** "After the singletrack, everything had completely split. I had found a group of a few guys and I was sure that I wouldn't see Matt again but he popped up almost immediately once we were back on the tarmac... Matt and I are in a group of around six that consisted of us, a tall guy named Madison, two guys on a Boulder team sponsored by Enve (remember these guys) and The Man In Black. Baker is nowhere to be seen and there is a group of maybe 10 guys 30 seconds up the road who we can see. We are 30 seconds down on a big group, 100 miles from the finish." (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/sbt-grvl-recap)

**Ben Brown [COMPETITIVE]:** "My lower back really starts to give me trouble... I will say that the initial road section and the first half hour of gravel were a little sketchy. 900 people spread out across the road, all jockeying to get to the front. There was a crash right next to me on the first rise." (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/sbt-grvl-recap)

**Bruce Lin [COMPETITIVE]:** "My finish time last year was 8:58:13, which I'm very proud of. But I'll have to shave an hour off my time to hit my goal, which is a lot to ask... I'm an amateur racer in my mid-30s. I'm starting to develop a bit of a dad bod. And I never have enough time to train." (https://www.theproscloset.com/blogs/news/my-race-plan-for-sbt-grvl-2023)

**Bruce Lin [COMPETITIVE]:** "I suffered from hip and lower back issues last year that caused a lot of discomfort from miles 80-110. I lost a lot of time as a result... I don't camp often and my sleeping setup is very barebones and janky. Plenty of riders can camp and feel fresh the next day, but I'm not one of them. I'm way too soft. So this time, I spent more money and got an actual room in a hotel." (https://www.theproscloset.com/blogs/news/my-race-plan-for-sbt-grvl-2023)

**Reggie Miller [COMPETITIVE]:** "I ended up riding 42 miles at a moderate pace, just tapering down each ride leading up to the race on the 14th... I quickly recognized a decrease in power output, which was to be expected because of the altitude." (https://trainright.com/reggie-miller-sbt-gravel-100-mile-gravel-race/)

**Reggie Miller [COMPETITIVE]:** "I had 3 main objectives coming into this race/event: have fun, don't crash, and finish in under 6 hours. Safe to say, I accomplished all 3... The route was nothing but laughs and entertainment, so having fun during the race was easy. The harder part was not crashing over a distance of 100 miles." (https://trainright.com/reggie-miller-sbt-gravel-100-mile-gravel-race/)

**Sydney Marshburn [COMPETITIVE]:** "Adding a para category to a large event like SBT GRVL showed the world that cycling is for everyone, no matter a person's physical impairment... It was the first time in years I didn't feel completely broken." (https://www.outsideonline.com/outdoor-adventure/biking/e-bike-paracycling-sbt-grvl-andrew-bernstein/)

**Andrew Bernstein [COMPETITIVE]:** "Sixty miles is comfortably within the range of my bike's batteries (and the strength in my legs) but I knew I had to be judicious with turbo mode or I wouldn't make it home... I switched to turbo mode for the long, final climb, and started passing some blown 60-milers who had dropped me earlier... I stopped the clock at three hours and two minutes, first paracyclist and 18th overall in the 60-mile distance." (https://www.outsideonline.com/outdoor-adventure/biking/e-bike-paracycling-sbt-grvl-andrew-bernstein/)

**Libby Brown [ELITE]:** "During our course recon the Friday before I got dehydrated and needed some IV help to recover after the ride. Fortunately, the IV totally did the trick and I was good to go on Sunday for the SBT GRVL Red Course (64 miles approximately 4,100 feet of climbing 50+ miles of gravel)." (https://sorellacycling.org/content.aspx?page_id=5&club_id=815352&item_id=68574)

**Libby Brown [ELITE]:** "I rode with a CamelBak with water and two bottles of electrolytes to start. This proved to be a good strategy because some of the surface made it hard to drink from the bottles. The route was challenging and it was a hot and dry but a solid day on the bike." (https://sorellacycling.org/content.aspx?page_id=5&club_id=815352&item_id=68574)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Tire Pressure & Setup [COMPETITIVE]:** Ben Brown noted running 27/29 PSI on the Front Range but considered adjusting for SBT GRVL roads. He experienced a sidewall tear days before the race requiring last-minute tire changes and worried about grip throughout. (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/sbt-grvl-recap)

**Hydration Strategy [ELITE]:** Libby Brown used a CamelBak with water plus two bottles of electrolytes. She noted this proved essential "because some of the surface made it hard to drink from the bottles." (https://sorellacycling.org/content.aspx?page_id=5&club_id=815352&item_id=68574)

**Chain Issues [COMPETITIVE]:** Bruce Lin experienced chain bouncing off after every bump at Colorado's FoCo Fondo in July, suggesting drivetrain reliability is critical for the rough sections. (https://www.theproscloset.com/blogs/news/my-race-plan-for-sbt-grvl-2023)

**Mechanical Failures [COMPETITIVE]:** Baker experienced a rock knocking his valve core loose, requiring re-inflation every 30 minutes until mile 120 when a mechanic fixed it on the spot. This separated him from his group on the first major climb. (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/sbt-grvl-recap)

## Weather Experienced

**2023 Conditions [COMPETITIVE]:** Libby Brown reported "hot and dry" conditions for the Red Course during the race. During course recon the Friday before, dehydration was severe enough to require IV treatment. (https://sorellacycling.org/content.aspx?page_id=5&club_id=815352&item_id=68574)

**2021 Montana (The Last Best Ride) [ELITE]:** Libby Brown noted race morning was wet with rain mostly stopped, low clouds present. The recon ride the day before was "raining and the conditions were super gritty and muddy." (https://sorellacycling.org/content.aspx?page_id=5&club_id=815352&item_id=68574)

**Pre-race travel weather [UNKNOWN]:** Ben Brown traveled through "sheets of rain pummeled the roof of the car" in New York area en route to Colorado, with water rising halfway up car wheels on the BQE. (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/sbt-grvl-recap)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Opening Sections:** The race starts with a 2-mile paved road section out of town before hitting the first gravel section. The initial gravel sector lasts approximately 30 miles. (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/sbt-grvl-recap)

**Dangerous Gravel Section:** "Around this point, we hit a section that the organizers had warned us about where a local landowner had laid down thick, loose gravel on a downhill. It was like riding through sand at a cyclocross race where you just sort of follow your wheel and hope for the best… except you're going like 40mph… and surrounded by other people… and the sand is rocks." - Ben Brown [COMPETITIVE] (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/sbt-grvl-recap)

**Hay Field CX Section:** After the first 30-mile gravel sector, riders hit tarmac briefly before "cutting back through a hay field for an impromptu bit of CX. This made for sapping riding." (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/sbt-grvl-recap)

**Major Climb (Mile 40):** "The first serious climb arrives at around mile 40; it's a 4-mile, 9%, gravel situation that goes from 6.5k to around 9.5k." (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/sbt-grvl-recap)

**Singletrack Section:** Course includes unexpected singletrack consisting of "a fairly straightforward jeep trail" covered in "a thick layer of fine, powdery dust." The trail goes into woods with a creek crossing before sprinting back onto gravel. (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/sbt-grvl-recap)

**Cow Creek Descent:** Bruce Lin specifically previewed "the final descent for Black and Blue course riders — Cow Creek. It is the roughest descent on the course, and there are lots of rocks, ruts, and as the name suggests, cows. It's possible to flat, take a bad line, or even crash in this section, especially when you're exhausted after a long day of racing." (https://www.theproscloset.com/blogs/news/my-race-plan-for-sbt-grvl-2023)

**Champagne Gravel Reputation:** Multiple sources describe the terrain as "champagne gravel" - smooth dirt roads compared to other gravel events. Libby Brown noted "The tarmac quickly turns into what they call 'champagne' gravel (smooth -ish)." (https://sorellacycling.org/content.aspx?page_id=5&club_id=815352&item_id=68574)

**Plateau Section:** After the first major climb, riders traverse "a long section of bare plateau, which was beautiful" before hitting the singletrack. (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/sbt-grvl-recap)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Opening Hour Intensity [COMPETITIVE]:** Ben Brown: "In that first hour, you had to go crazy hard just to stay with the group. Our power was barely lower than it would be in a 75-minute crit." His group agreed not to go too deep early due to coming straight from sea level and altitude concerns. (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/sbt-grvl-recap)

**Early Race Positioning [COMPETITIVE]:** Ben Brown was "hesitant to absolutely jam it down the descents to get to the front. After 20 minutes, the front group was gone and the race was shattered. Chase groups started to form." The opening is described as sketchy with 900 people jockeying for position. (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/sbt-grvl-recap)

**Altitude Pacing [COMPETITIVE]:** Ben Brown and Matt made a pact not to go too hard on the mile-40 climb "given that there was still 100 miles to go." Even with conservative pacing, altitude effects were severe: "It was taking me about 10 minutes to finish every bite of Clif bars because I needed to breathe so hard." (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/sbt-grvl-recap)

**Hydration Strategy [ELITE]:** Libby Brown took her time and paced effort carefully, using course recon knowledge to optimize line choice. She prioritized hydration with CamelBak + 2 bottles given the hot, dry conditions. (https://sorellacycling.org/content.aspx?page_id=5&club_id=815352&item_id=68574)

**Nutrition Challenges [COMPETITIVE]:** Ben Brown planned to start eating solid food but "it was immediately clear that I would not be removing my hands from the bars for a while so I had to settle for furiously guzzling gels whenever it was safe" in the first hour. (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/sbt-grvl-recap)

**Pre-Race Acclimatization [COMPETITIVE]:** Bruce Lin arrived Friday afternoon before Sunday start with minimal acclimatization time. Reggie Miller spent a week riding outside Denver/Boulder before the race. (https://www.theproscloset.com/blogs/news/my-race-plan-for-sbt-grvl-2023, https://trainright.com/reggie-miller-sbt-gravel-100-mile-gravel-race/)

**Pre-Hydration Strategy [COMPETITIVE]:** Bruce Lin employed "pre-hydration" by regularly drinking water and electrolyte mix throughout the drive to Steamboat, "It will set me up well for Sunday morning so I won't have to smash water right after waking up and then visit the bathroom multiple times before the start." (https://www.theproscloset.com/blogs/news/my-race-plan-for-sbt-grvl-2023)

**Course Preview Strategy [COMPETITIVE]:** Bruce Lin rode the last 20 miles in reverse the day before to preview Cow Creek descent. He specifically wanted to attack this section if with a group and had the legs, believing preview knowledge would give him an edge. (https://www.theproscloset.com/blogs/news/my-race-plan-for-sbt-grvl-2023)

**Time Goals:** 
- Ben Brown [COMPETITIVE]: Targeting sub-10 hours on Black (142 miles), previous year 8:58:13
- Bruce Lin [COMPETITIVE]: Goal of sub-8 hours on Black (142 miles), previous year 8:58:13  
- Reggie Miller [COMPETITIVE]: Goal under 6 hours for 100-mile Blue course (https://trainright.com/reggie-miller-sbt-gravel-100-mile-gravel-race/)
- Andrew Bernstein [COMPETITIVE]: Finished 60-mile in 3:02, first paracyclist (https://www.outsideonline.com/outdoor-adventure/biking/e-bike-paracycling-sbt-grvl-andrew-bernstein/)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Altitude Effects [COMPETITIVE]:** Multiple riders noted severe breathing difficulties. Ben Brown: "Cresting the hill, I really did start to notice the altitude... It was taking me about 10 minutes to finish every bite of Clif bars because I needed to breathe so hard." Reggie Miller noted "a decrease in power output, which was to be expected because of the altitude." (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/sbt-grvl-recap, https://trainright.com/reggie-miller-sbt-gravel-100-mile-gravel-race/)

**Dehydration Risk [ELITE]:** Libby Brown required IV treatment after Friday course recon due to dehydration: "During our course recon the Friday before I got dehydrated and needed some IV help to recover after the ride." (https://sorellacycling.org/content.aspx?page_id=5&club_id=815352&item_id=68574)

**Mechanical Issues [COMPETITIVE]:** Baker had "a Very Bad Day of Mechanicals" starting with a rock knocking his valve core loose, requiring re-inflation every 30 minutes for 120 miles until a mechanic finally fixed it. This caused him to separate from his group on the first climb. Bruce Lin experienced chain issues bouncing off at FoCo Fondo. (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/sbt-grvl-recap, https://www.theproscloset.com/blogs/news/my-race-plan-for-sbt-grvl-2023)

**Crashes in Opening [COMPETITIVE]:** Ben Brown: "There was a crash right next to me on the first rise. Rattled, I drifted back a bit because I was hesitant to absolutely jam it down the descents to get to the front." (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/sbt-grvl-recap)

**Lower Back/Hip Issues [COMPETITIVE]:** Bruce Lin: "I suffered from hip and lower back issues last year that caused a lot of discomfort from miles 80-110. I lost a lot of time as a result." Ben Brown also noted lower back trouble in later miles. (https://www.theproscloset.com/blogs/news/my-race-plan-for-sbt-grvl-2023, https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/sbt-grvl-recap)

**Dangerous Descents:** The loose gravel downhill section and Cow Creek descent present crash/flat risks when fatigued. (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/sbt-grvl-recap, https://www.theproscloset.com/blogs/news/my-race-plan-for-sbt-grvl-2023)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Inclusive Event Culture:** Greer Van Dyck (SBT GRVL community relations director): "We feel really strongly that bikes are a vehicle to build relationships, build community, and see new places. Our efforts at being inclusive is the vehicle to help more people of all kinds access that experience." (https://www.outsideonline.com/outdoor-adventure/biking/e-bike-paracycling-sbt-grvl-andrew-bernstein/)

**Para-Cycling Integration:** More than 40 para-athletes attended in 2022. Andrew Bernstein noted: "There were enough of us that finding accessible parking in town was a bit of an unusual and welcome challenge. We exchanged knowing nods with each other as we cruised the pre-race expo on Yampa Street." The event welcomed paracyclists, non-binary athletes, BIPOC-focused group Ride For Racial Justice, and body-inclusive group All Bodies On Bikes. (https://www.outsideonline.com/outdoor-adventure/biking/e-bike-paracycling-sbt-grvl-andrew-bernstein/)

**Pro/Elite Presence:** Ben Brown noted "the race still attracts absolutely top bin talent" including names like Keegan Swenson, Tiffany Cromwell, and Lachlan Morton. (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/sbt-grvl-recap)

**Pre-Race Atmosphere:** Reggie Miller: "It was fun to open up the legs and tow the group back for those 17 miles. The pace was high but I felt really good. The highlight for me on that ride was meeting Marcus and Quincy from Ride For Racial Justice... Bikes bringing people together once again." (https://trainright.com/reggie-miller-sbt-gravel-100-mile-gravel-race/)

**Junior Engagement:** Castelli sponsored a Junior Ride with 30-40 kids ages 8-17 the Friday before. Reggie Miller: "The ride was all about connecting with the next generation on two wheels and seeing the smiles on the kids' faces." (https://trainright.com/reggie-miller-sbt-gravel-100-mile-gravel-race/)

**Expo and Town Scene:** The race features an expo on Yampa Street with vendor tents, including BOOMBABY/Castelli booth with activities for kids and spectators. (https://trainright.com/reggie-miller-sbt-gravel-100-mile-gravel-race/)

**Post-Race Scene:** Ben Brown: "I spent the rest of the day hanging at the finish with my fiancee and friends, cheering for other riders." (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/sbt-grvl-recap)

**Steamboat Setting:** Multiple riders praised the town. Reggie Miller: "The trails in Steamboat are amazing and they go on forever... I got a bit lost, but it was the BEST kind of lost feeling I could have ever imagined." Ben Brown described riding through "beautiful and then… BAM out of nowhere— singletrack" and seeing teammate Daghan shooting the race: "We saw a lot of him in the first few hours and it was such a boost every single time we heard a 'Fuck yeah TBD!'" (https://trainright.com/reggie-miller-sbt-gravel-100-mile-gravel-race/, https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/sbt-grvl-recap)

**Comparison to Other Events:** Libby Brown: "SBT GRVL was like a road race on gravel and The Last Best Ride was gravel with friends going as fast as you wanted." (https://sorellacycling.org/content.aspx?page_id=5&club_id=815352&item_id=68574)
