# GRAN FONDO STRADE BIANCHE — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Florian 'Flo' Nowak [ELITE]:** "I never got the chance to take part in the race when I was riding as a pro, but it had been on my bucket list for a long time... The feeling riding up the last steep kilometer to Piazza del Campo in Sienna was just amazing and all the spectators cheering gave me goosebumps. Now I can also understand why even some of the pro riders needed to push their bike up there from time to time – its way tougher than it looks on the TV. Luckily, I managed to stay on my bike this time and hopefully next time, I will do even better." (https://gravelunion.cc/article/gran-fondo-strade-bianche-ride-report)

**George Scott [ELITE]:** "As the gradient kicks up to 20 per cent, the rear wheel of the rider in front slips on the loose gravel beneath the tyre. The pedals jump forward, bucking the tired body out of the saddle. He wobbles, then topples and, in slow-motion, makes his way to the ground for an involuntary inspection of Tuscany's white gravel roads." (https://www.bikeradar.com/features/long-reads/gran-fondo-strade-bianche)

**Nils Brun [ELITE]:** "Strade Bianche was my very first one-day World Tour race last year. It was a bit of a shock! I was more prepared for it this time and it was an absolute pleasure to spend some sectors at the front." (https://www.tudorprocycling.com/post/strade-bianche-a-beautiful-and-unique-experience)

**Hannes Wilksch [ELITE]:** "It's beautiful! I already want to come back!" (https://www.tudorprocycling.com/post/strade-bianche-a-beautiful-and-unique-experience)

**Anonymous rider [UNKNOWN]:** "It takes a lot of training — Gravel ride for experts. Serious training required." (https://gfstradebianche.it/en/)

**Anonymous rider [UNKNOWN]:** "A must-do! A fantastic route and well-organised event. In a nutshell, GO FOR IT!!! I hope to do it in the rain next year to experience the 'magic' of mud." (https://gfstradebianche.it/en/)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Flo Nowak [ELITE]:** Used a Scott Addict gravel bike fitted with Shimano GRX Di2 components and 32mm wide tyres. He notes: "The pros take part in the race on their standard road race bikes that are normally equipped with 28-30mm tyres. But, to have a little bit more comfort and a wider range of gears while still running smoothly on the asphalt sections, I choose my Scott Addict gravel bike." (https://gravelunion.cc/article/gran-fondo-strade-bianche-ride-report)

**George Scott [ELITE]:** Used the latest Cannondale SuperSix Evo Hi-Mod with 30c rubber and wireless electronic groupset, noting he "swapped round-tubed steel for aero-profiled carbon fibre; skinny tubular tyres for wide 30c rubber; and down-tube shifters for a wireless electronic groupset." (https://www.bikeradar.com/features/long-reads/gran-fondo-strade-bianche)

**Tudor Pro Cycling team [ELITE]:** "Special preparations were also necessary. Stronger tires (Schwalbe Pro One) were used, different pressures were applied, and wheelsets were available at each of the ten feeding points strategically chosen along the parcours. Only one flat tire was to deplore but it unfortunately happened to Nils Brun as he was in the early breakaway with four other riders." (https://www.tudorprocycling.com/post/strade-bianche-a-beautiful-and-unique-experience)

**Cycling House fleet [ELITE participants]:** "Our rental fleet in Italy... full-carbon rental bikes with SRAM eTap shifting. Some guests flew with their own bikes which is also a great option for this trip." (https://thecyclinghouse.com/reflections-in-photos-our-strade-bianche-cycling-trip-to-tuscany)

**inGamba offering [ELITE participants]:** "Pinarello Grevil F with SRAM RED eTap AXS — The versatile GREVIL F is ready for anything. It can accommodate any kind of wheel or tyre combination, adapting to your every need" (https://ingamba.pro/trip/the-strade-bianche-experience-2026/)

## Weather Experienced

**2021 Edition (September, delayed from March):** Flo Nowak reported: "We were super lucky and had perfect weather conditions when I rode, but I would also love to come back and ride the event again in the spring when it is normally hosted." (https://gravelunion.cc/article/gran-fondo-strade-bianche-ride-report)

**2023 Edition:** George Scott noted: "despite the sun only just rising above the church towers of Siena, and the early-morning temperature in single figures, the atmosphere is red-hot" (https://www.bikeradar.com/features/long-reads/gran-fondo-strade-bianche)

**2024 Edition:** "The weather was perfect for us, the pasta was plentiful" according to Owen Gue from Cycling House (https://thecyclinghouse.com/reflections-in-photos-our-strade-bianche-cycling-trip-to-tuscany)

**Variable conditions noted:** One anonymous rider reported: "The first time I struggled with cold and mud, this time with heat and dust" (https://gfstradebianche.it/en/)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Gravel sectors characteristics [ELITE perspective]:** "You might expect the gravel sectors to be easy, but they are definitely not! A lot of climbing needed to be done. And what goes up must come down, so you also have some technical descents to contend with as well." - Flo Nowak (https://gravelunion.cc/article/gran-fondo-strade-bianche-ride-report)

**Gravel surface quality:** "The Vidritta sector is merely a taste of things to come, rated only 1/5 by the organisers and all slightly downhill. In some respects, it's like the pavé of Paris-Roubaix, rewarding commitment to a big gear. The Bagnia sector that follows offers the first real test. A fast descent that sees me gripping the bars tightly – and hoping my tyres are doing the same on the pockmarked surface below – flows into a 3.2km climb with a rain-rutted surface that immediately saps any momentum." - George Scott [ELITE] (https://www.bikeradar.com/features/long-reads/gran-fondo-strade-bianche)

**Critical sectors - San Martino:** "Rolling gravel stretch that tests riders with loose surfaces and constant undulations, draining the legs before the race's big moments." (https://thecyclinghouse.com/reflections-in-photos-our-strade-bianche-cycling-trip-to-tuscany)

**Critical sectors - Santa Maria:** "Where Pogačar attacked in 2024 and held it to the finish. It features some of the steepest climbs (20%) and tricky descents—this is where race-defining moves happen." (https://thecyclinghouse.com/reflections-in-photos-our-strade-bianche-cycling-trip-to-tuscany)

**Final climb to Siena:** "The final climb in Siena, on the narrow street of Via Santa Caterina, peaks at 16 per cent, ahead of the finish in the city's cavernous square, the Piazza del Campo." (https://www.bikeradar.com/features/long-reads/gran-fondo-strade-bianche)

**Course profile timing:** "While the majority of the gravel comes during the first half of the route, the punchiest climbs come in the final 40km, via a succession of double-digit ramps." - George Scott [ELITE] (https://www.bikeradar.com/features/long-reads/gran-fondo-strade-bianche)

**Start section:** "The first 20km are on paved roads, with a few short rises to warm up the legs... The first section of sterrato, coming after 20km, immediately strings things out." (https://www.bikeradar.com/features/long-reads/gran-fondo-strade-bianche)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Initial pace warning [ELITE perspective]:** "Every rider here is wound tight like a spring and as the flag drops, I hit the short descent out of Siena before finding myself surrounded, once again, by riders in a group as tight as the start pen. The pace is lightning-fast – as is typical for an Italian gran fondo" - George Scott [ELITE] (https://www.bikeradar.com/features/long-reads/gran-fondo-strade-bianche)

**Pacing strategy [ELITE perspective]:** "The Bagnia sector... is the kind of climb – early in the route – where it'd be easy to burn through too many matches. This is where the week's recce rides start to pay off – I know how much climbing we've got to come." - George Scott [ELITE] (https://www.bikeradar.com/features/long-reads/gran-fondo-strade-bianche)

**Pro vs. amateur approach [ELITE]:** "In the beginning I stayed with the leading group and followed them on to the first two gravel sectors. But, as the area offered some amazing views and the feed stations were stocked with lots of regional culinary delights, I made sure that I actually enjoyed taking part in the event, so I stopped from time to time to admire the views and also to sample the hospitality of the event organisers." - Flo Nowak [ELITE] (https://gravelunion.cc/article/gran-fondo-strade-bianche-ride-report)

**Race tactics note [ELITE]:** "From a tactical perspective, Strade Bianche cannot be raced like any other race. Riders must be 'switched on' from the first kilometer and stay focused to avoid all the pitfalls that can get in their way and put an end to their ambitions, and to their race." (https://www.tudorprocycling.com/post/strade-bianche-a-beautiful-and-unique-experience)

**Preparation importance [ELITE]:** "This race must be very well-prepared. It requires the same work as Paris-Roubaix and Tour of Flanders. One recon ride is necessary, two are better. It is important that riders have the course in mind because it can be dangerous." - Matteo Tosatto, Sports Director (https://www.tudorprocycling.com/post/strade-bianche-a-beautiful-and-unique-experience)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Mechanical issues:** Tudor Pro Cycling reported: "Only one flat tire was to deplore but it unfortunately happened to Nils Brun as he was in the early breakaway with four other riders" — indicating that a mechanical at a critical moment can end race ambitions even for elite riders. (https://www.tudorprocycling.com/post/strade-bianche-a-beautiful-and-unique-experience)

**Crashes on steep gravel climbs:** George Scott witnessed: "As the gradient kicks up to 20 per cent, the rear wheel of the rider in front slips on the loose gravel beneath the tyre. The pedals jump forward, bucking the tired body out of the saddle. He wobbles, then topples and, in slow-motion, makes his way to the ground" (https://www.bikeradar.com/features/long-reads/gran-fondo-strade-bianche)

**Bike handling requirements:** "The gravel roads are not flat. They go up, and they go down too. Riders must have great confidence in their equipment and show great bike handling skills." - Matteo Tosatto (https://www.tudorprocycling.com/post/strade-bianche-a-beautiful-and-unique-experience)

**Course difficulty underestimation:** Multiple riders warned: "It's a much tougher Gran Fondo than one may think!" and "Gravel ride for experts. Serious training required." (https://gfstradebianche.it/en/)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Start atmosphere:** "Italian gran fondo organisers don't do things by halves and, despite the sun only just rising above the church towers of Siena, and the early-morning temperature in single figures, the atmosphere is red-hot in the city's Fortezza Medicea, the 16th Century fort serving as the start pen. 'You are strong!' 'Come on guys, all in!' Against a soundtrack of deafening rock music, the compere is working his vocal chords" - George Scott [ELITE] (https://www.bikeradar.com/features/long-reads/gran-fondo-strade-bianche)

**VIP presence:** "Pozzato, Cancellara, Cipollini, Colbrelli, Bettini — the compere continues, reeling off the star-studded cast of former pros in the VIP pen, also riding the gran fondo. Cancellara – the Classics legend, aptly nicknamed Spartacus – is the only three-time winner of the men's elite race" (https://www.bikeradar.com/features/long-reads/gran-fondo-strade-bianche)

**Crowd support on final climb:** "The feeling riding up the last steep kilometer to Piazza del Campo in Sienna was just amazing and all the spectators cheering gave me goosebumps" - Flo Nowak [ELITE] (https://gravelunion.cc/article/gran-fondo-strade-ride-report)

**Finish experience:** "Riding up Santa Caterina to the Piazza del Campo is something that stays with you forever... Just like the pros the day before, we climbed into Siena and finished in Il Campo—where the crowd cheered us home." (https://thecyclinghouse.com/reflections-in-photos-our-strade-bianche-cycling-trip-to-tuscany)

**Event scale:** "8,500 participants are ready to challenge each other on the same roads as the Pros" with 7,000 riders reported in 2023 (https://gfstradebianche.it/en/ and https://www.bikeradar.com/features/long-reads/gran-fondo-strade-bianche)

**Post-race amenities:** "After crossing the finish line, head back to the village for the final pasta party and share your experience with friends and other amateurs!" (https://gfstradebianche.it/en/)

**Organization quality:** "Excellent assistance on the route... I was amazed by everything that was going on and around me! In every respect... from bib pick-up to race package" (https://gfstradebianche.it/en/)

**Watching the pro race:** "Watching a professional cycling race is typically an experience of contrasts... Not at Strade Bianche. From our earlier vantage point on the climb of San Martino in Grania, the lead group, driven by Ineos-Grenadiers, had, indeed, passed in a flash. But from there, a strung-out line of chasers fights in vain" - George Scott [ELITE] (https://www.bikeradar.com/features/long-reads/gran-fondo-strade-bianche)

**Landscape beauty:** "The Crete Senesi area south of Siena. Translating to the 'clays of Siena', the grey soil gives the landscape its lunar-like appearance. Indeed, every year the Strade Bianche conjures some of the most striking – and beautiful – images of the pro cycling season, dust clouds billowing above the peloton as it hits the gravel."
