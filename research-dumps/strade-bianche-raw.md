## **TERRAIN & COURSE**
**The "Strade Bianche" Surface:**
* **Description:** It is *not* "American gravel." It is compacted earth/clay with small crushed stones.
* **Ride Feel:** When dry, it rides like "rough pavement"—very fast but dusty. When wet, it turns into "concrete paste" that sticks to drivetrains but doesn't usually cause deep sinking like mud.
* **Comparison:** It is closer to a cobblestone classic (Roubaix) than Unbound Gravel. It favors a road bike with wider tires rather than a dedicated gravel rig.
* **Hills:** Constant, punchy "rollers" with gradients often hitting 10-18%. There is almost zero flat terrain to recover.
**Key Sectors (Gran Fondo Route):**
1. **San Martino in Grania (9.5km):** Long, dragging sector that grinds riders down mid-race. Exposed to wind.
3. **Monte Sante Marie (11.5km):** The hardest sector. Steep climbs and technical descents. This is where the race breaks apart.
5. **Le Tolfe (1.1km):** Comes late in the race. Short but brutal kick (max 18%).
7. **Via Santa Caterina:** The final 500m paved/cobbled climb into Siena (avg 12%, max 16%).

## **WEATHER HISTORY (March Tuscany)**
**The Gamble:** March is volatile.
* **Best Case:** Cool spring sun (10-15°C). Dusty, fast.
* **Worst Case:** "Epic" cold rain (2-8°C). The white dust turns into a grey liquid paste that destroys brake pads and drivetrains.
* **Reality:** You must prepare for cold. Mornings in Siena are near freezing. Arm warmers and gilets are mandatory start-line attire.
## **EQUIPMENT CONSENSUS (Critical for Training Plan)**
**Tire Choice is the #1 Debate:**
* **Consensus:** A **30mm - 32mm Road Tubeless tire** is the "weapon of choice."
* **Why?** 70% of the course is asphalt. 40mm gravel tires are "overkill" and slow you down on the climbs and road transfers. 25mm is doable (and was standard for pros until recently) but punishing for an amateur.
* **Tire Pressure:** Higher than pure gravel. Think **50-70 psi** (depending on weight) rather than the 30-40 psi of US gravel.
* **Bike:** Endurance Road Bike (e.g., Specialized Roubaix, Canyon Endurace) is ideal. A Gravel bike is fine but will feel slow unless you fit slicker tires.

## **LOGISTICS**
* **Registration:** Opens the previous **September/October**. It sells out quickly.
* **Base:** **Siena** is the only logical place to stay. The start (Fortezza Medicea) and finish (Piazza del Campo) are in the city center.
* **Travel:** Fly to **Florence (FLR)** or **Pisa (PSA)**. Rent a car or take a train to Siena.
* **Medical Certificate:** **CRITICAL.** Italy requires a specific sports medical certificate for all participants. You *cannot* race without this signed doctor's note uploaded in advance.
