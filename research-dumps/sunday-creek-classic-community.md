# SUNDAY CREEK CLASSIC — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Imogen Smith [ELITE]:** "Racing a gravel bike was awesome at the start, with the fast climbs and descents. I did have to unclip for one small section of Mt Buggery, and I think mountain bike experience helped here. But from here on there were times I questioned whether a gravel bike was the right choice." (https://marathonmtb.com/2024/04/30/bike-choice-sunday-creek-classic/)

**Imogen Smith [ELITE]:** "The descent along Sunday Creek Road made me rethinking my bike choice – all you could do was let go of the brakes and grit your teeth. And if you didn't clench your jaw you'd probably bite your tongue. It felt like survival and there were flats everywhere." (https://marathonmtb.com/2024/04/30/bike-choice-sunday-creek-classic/)

**Imogen Smith [ELITE]:** "You must be a good bike handler to tackle Sunday Creek Classic on a gravel bike if you want to be competitive. The roadies on their gravel bikes were the riders I saw not having a great day." (https://marathonmtb.com/2024/04/30/bike-choice-sunday-creek-classic/)

**Imogen Smith [ELITE]:** "At about an hour in we were sitting pretty, taking selfies under a cloudless, sunny sky surrounded by paddocks of little calves and ponies. We came to a deep causeway. The guy at the front shook his head and dismounted 'I'm not riding into that'. Water flooded the road in every direction... Eve rolled straight past everyone and into the deep. I had just enough momentum to follow her wheel, realising that no matter what, I was going to get my feet wet, and this is gravel, after all." (https://marathonmtb.com/2023/06/02/sunday-creek-classic-goosebumps-and-gravel/)

**Imogen Smith [ELITE]:** "I'd been going uphill for nearly 40 minutes and had one gel left, and I was… lost? Long story short, I didn't get to ride the end of the course. I got rescued instead." After missing a turn and ending up doing an extra 400m of climbing with "utterly, totally spent after 6.5 hours of riding, an extra 400m vert of hike a bike, and a TSS of 425 on zero solid food." (https://marathonmtb.com/2023/06/02/sunday-creek-classic-goosebumps-and-gravel/)

**Ryan Cavanagh [ELITE]:** "The Sunday Creek Classic was without a doubt one of the single hardest one-day courses I have ever ridden! The ultra-steep climbs were a new challenge for me. Having never had the opportunity to race on such terrain before, it was a completely new experience for me. The fact that walking seemed the only option on some uphills really turned this ride into a challenge of more than just bike fitness. It was a real mental fight at some points." (https://www.gravelclassics.com.au/news/the-sunday-creek-classic-the-most-challenging-single-day-ride-in-australia)

**Ryan Cavanagh [ELITE]:** Won the 120km race in 5:04:28. "I was certainly glad to have a XC MTB on many of the up or downhill sections. This was made immediately apparent on the first downhill where a gap formed to the other riders behind me." (https://www.gravelclassics.com.au/news/the-sunday-creek-classic-the-most-challenging-single-day-ride-in-australia)

**Lizzie Hepple [ELITE]:** Finished the 120km in 8:29:34. "As a major challenge - it exceeded expectations! The beginning, middle and final 10kms were beyond my wildest dreams, I mean nightmares! I can't say those bits were really enjoyable, but I told myself, 'It's all part of the adventure' and to suck it up, and I felt proud to get through it physically and mentally." (https://www.gravelclassics.com.au/news/the-sunday-creek-classic-the-most-challenging-single-day-ride-in-australia)

**Lizzie Hepple [ELITE]:** "The other 100kms of 'normal', but still quite challenging, and incredibly scenic gravel roads, I enjoyed every moment. Honestly, it was so much fun being in the fresh air, with beautiful but changing vistas." (https://www.gravelclassics.com.au/news/the-sunday-creek-classic-the-most-challenging-single-day-ride-in-australia)

**Paul and Melanie Ewing [COMPETITIVE]:** Last finishers on the 120km course recorded exactly 12 hours. (https://www.gravelclassics.com.au/news/the-sunday-creek-classic-the-most-challenging-single-day-ride-in-australia)

**Stephen Finch [COMPETITIVE]:** On the 50km route for almost 8 hours. (https://www.gravelclassics.com.au/news/the-sunday-creek-classic-the-most-challenging-single-day-ride-in-australia)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**GRAVEL BIKE SETUPS:**

**Imogen Smith [ELITE]:** Used a Trek Checkpoint SL 5 with:
- Shimano GRX 2×11 drivetrain (31/48 chainrings, 11-32 cassette)
- 40mm Maxxis Ravager EXO tyres
- Tubolight EVO Gravel tyre inserts (37g each for impact protection)
- Bespoke carbon road wheels
- She noted: "I'd love more lower gears on Mt Buggery – that was the only place. The rest of the climbing is sustained but not brutally steep." (https://marathonmtb.com/2024/04/30/bike-choice-sunday-creek-classic/)

**MOUNTAIN BIKE SETUPS:**

**Mike Blewitt [COMPETITIVE]:** Used a Factor Lando XC with:
- 120mm travel front and rear (29er)
- Shimano 12-speed: 34t chainring with 10-51 cassette
- 2.25" Maxxis Aspen EXO tyres on 25mm internal width carbon wheels (1290g wheelset)
- 22/24 psi tire pressure
- He noted: "I rarely felt under geared on the flats – although I did feel underdone at times! I can probably manage a 36t chain ring on Mt Buggery, but that would depend on line selection, conditions and whether I'd gone too hard earlier on the climb." (https://marathonmtb.com/2024/04/30/bike-choice-sunday-creek-classic/)

**Ryan Cavanagh [ELITE]:** "I was certainly glad to have a XC MTB on many of the up or downhill sections." Won on a mountain bike in 5:04:28. (https://www.gravelclassics.com.au/news/the-sunday-creek-classic-the-most-challenging-single-day-ride-in-australia)

**GENERAL ADVICE:**

**Mike Blewitt [COMPETITIVE]:** "No matter your choice of bike you should consider the following: volume, tread height and support. Wider is almost always better (to a point) as you have a larger contact patch for braking and climbing traction, and can therefore make do with less tread height – so it rolls faster. A tyre with good support means the sidewalls will have the integrity for the rocks you don't see." Notes that "35mm plus recommended" for tires. (https://marathonmtb.com/2024/04/30/bike-choice-sunday-creek-classic/)

**Imogen Smith [ELITE]:** "A gravel bike is a great choice for the Sunday Creek Classic as nothing is unrideable – but comfort is another matter. For comfort and more of an assurance on not flatting, a mountain bike is also a good choice." (https://marathonmtb.com/2024/04/30/bike-choice-sunday-creek-classic/)

**Event organizers:** "Best leave those carbon soled road shoes behind – you will be pushing the bike at some stage!" (https://www.zinc96.com.au/event/sunday-creek-classic/)

**SPARES & CARRYING CAPACITY:**

**Mike Blewitt [COMPETITIVE]:** Recommends: "Two tubes, a tyre lever and a plug kit. Chances are you will want to keep pocket space free for snacks. I used Attaquer All-Day Cargo Bibs and ended up using one pocket for food, and the other for rubbish." Also notes if your mountain bike only carries one bottle, you'll need a hydration pack. (https://marathonmtb.com/2024/04/30/bike-choice-sunday-creek-classic/)

## Weather Experienced

**2023 race conditions:** Clear blue skies, "chilly 7am" start where riders "stripped down to jerseys and bibs," sunny day. One deep causeway with water flooding the road. (https://marathonmtb.com/2023/06/02/sunday-creek-classic-goosebumps-and-gravel/)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**COURSE START - INITIAL CLIMBS:**

The race rolls out up Kenilworth's main street, heading into state forest with opening climbs under "towering hoop pine plantations" on "good quality dirt road" with "some steep pinches." Then transitions through Pullen Lane (dirt road) cutting through forest of hoop pine before hitting Coonoongibber Creek Road. (https://marathonmtb.com/2024/04/30/bike-choice-sunday-creek-classic/ and https://bq.org.au/where-to-rides/sunday-creek-gravel-loop/)

**Imogen Smith [ELITE]:** Described the first 60 minutes as "fast climbs and descents" on gravel bike, with her and a riding partner "taking selfies under a cloudless, sunny sky surrounded by paddocks of little calves and ponies." (https://marathonmtb.com/2023/06/02/sunday-creek-classic-goosebumps-and-gravel/)

**WATER CROSSING:**

**Imogen Smith [ELITE]:** "At about an hour in... We came to a deep causeway. The guy at the front shook his head and dismounted 'I'm not riding into that'. Water flooded the road in every direction, so there was no option to get around it." She and Eve Conyers rode through while others dismounted. (https://marathonmtb.com/2023/06/02/sunday-creek-classic-goosebumps-and-gravel/)

**MT BUGGERY (around 38-40km mark):**

**Imogen Smith [ELITE]:** "At the 40km mark we shared a passionate bit of grovelling up Mt Buggery, a key feature in the event marketing campaign. Who named Mt Buggery is lost to history, but why they named it remains potently obvious. The climb is quite simply an unlovable and difficult lump that doesn't finish when it should. Most of it is rideable, but near the top comes a series of three or four steep, loose, rutted ramps, barely achievable even for the MTBs, and punctuated with rocky descents." She cleaned the first three ramps but walked the last. (https://marathonmtb.com/2023/06/02/sunday-creek-classic-goosebumps-and-gravel/)

**Mike Blewitt [COMPETITIVE]:** Notes the climb starts at "about the 38km point" with "steep climbing in a series of 'you've got to be kidding me!' ramps. This road was graded in May 2024, meaning if you have the legs and lungs you can ride it on a gravel bike. Maybe. Expect to walk some sections. A mountain bike may have more success, but if you're loaded, expect to walk a couple of sections." (https://bq.org.au/where-to-rides/sunday-creek-gravel-loop/)

**BELLA CREEK VALLEY:**

"Mostly a gentle ride up the valley, across cattle grids and alongside the river. There are numerous crossings, and at times there may be stock on the road." Passes through Bella Creek Station. (https://bq.org.au/where-to-rides/sunday-creek-gravel-loop/)

**JIMNA (around 73-75km mark):**

Jimna has "a small shop" and Jimna Base Camp (old school turned refuge, open weekends) offering camping, the old headmaster's house to rent, coffee, snack food, toilets, and showers. Only resupply point on course. (https://bq.org.au/where-to-rides/sunday-creek-gravel-loop/)

**SUNDAY CREEK ROAD (main descent back):**

**Mike Blewitt [COMPETITIVE]:** "A rolling descent along a ridgeline. It's primarily clay based and has had untold amounts of railroad balast sunk into the surface. It's a rough dirt road, with extended sections of descending. While at first it was fun flying down at warp speed, in the end it was still tiring on a high end XC full-suspension bike, and we passed two race leaders with terminal flat tyres." (https://marathonmtb.com/2024/04/30/bike-choice-sunday-creek-classic/)

**Imogen Smith [ELITE]:** Described Sunday Creek Road descent as "the most painful, unrewarding descent of my life. Sunday Creek Road isn't a road so much as a collection of sharp rocks held together like extreme nougat." She noted pushing "waaaay into the 'out of control' no-go zone that experienced cyclists usually avoid at all costs" and suggested "gravel racing means you set your bike up as well as you can, then completely abandon any caution, ignore the fact that you can't actually see anything you're hitting, and hope for the best." (https://marathonmtb.com/2023/06/02/sunday-creek-classic-goosebumps-and-gravel/)

**FINAL HIKE-A-BIKE SECTION:**

**Imogen Smith [ELITE]:** When attempting to complete the missed section: "Someone had told me there were just two dismount sections of about 5 and 3 minutes, so by the time I got to the fourth dismount of about 10 minutes, hauling my bike over impossible head-high moto ruts, I began to wonder if something was up... The track getting narrower and narrower, the dismounts longer. I began to notice there were no tyre marks. No footprints. Quite a bit of lantana." (https://marathonmtb.com/2023/06/02/sunday-creek-classic-goosebumps-and-gravel/)

**OVERALL TERRAIN MIX:**

Course described as taking in "everything from dry eucalyptus to sub-tropical rainforest forest and open cattle grazing country" with "fire trails, gravel roads and some single track." Terrain varies from "champagne gravel that deteriorates to rough rock and loose surfaces." (https://marathonmtb.com/2024/04/30/bike-choice-sunday-creek-classic/ and https://www.zinc96.com.au/event/sunday-creek-classic/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**PACING ADVICE:**

**Ryan Cavanagh [ELITE]** (5:04:28 finish): "At that point I just focused on not exerting myself too much, too early, before the real physical testing point of Mt. Buggery. I was trying to keep a solid consistent pace for the entire course." He opened a gap on the first downhill due to his XC MTB choice. (https://www.gravelclassics.com.au/news/the-sunday-creek-classic-the-most-challenging-single-day-ride-in-australia)

**Imogen Smith [ELITE]** (attempted finish, got lost): After Mt Buggery at about halfway: "Eve and I had dropped all the men by now and sent it down the other side, diving into a long ridgeline where at some point we realised we still weren't even half-way through the race, so we sat the hell up and let the pace drop a little. It was the perfect time for a D&M, and the day felt like the best kind of training ride: hard, scenic, and with excellent conversation." She and Eve were "riding in the top 10 men, and we wanted to see if we could stay there." (https://marathonmtb.com/2023/06/02/sunday-creek-classic-goosebumps-and-gravel/)

**NUTRITION:**

**Imogen Smith [ELITE]** (TSS of 425, 6.5+ hours riding): Started with gels, "sucked down four in the first hour alone" which created "a severe shortage of gels" so she "stuffed handfuls of jelly snakes up my jersey and ate them like spaghetti for the next 40 kilometres." Later when attempting the missed section, she brought "three gels for the 45-minute section, and I needed one straight away. Then I took my second gel five minutes later... I began to wonder if something was up. I hadn't seen a turnoff... I'd been going uphill for nearly 40 minutes and had one gel left." Finished "utterly, totally spent after 6.5 hours of riding, an extra 400m vert of hike a bike, and a TSS of 425 on zero solid food." (https://marathonmtb.com/2023/06/02/sunday-creek-classic-goosebumps-and-gravel/)

**HYDRATION:**

**Mike Blewitt [COMPETITIVE]:** "Carry at least 1.5L of water as you start this ride – if you have greater capacity, carry more. This is an advanced ride so if you plan to take all day to get to Jimna, carry sufficient supplies for the day." (https://bq.org.au/where-to-rides/sunday-creek-gravel-loop/)

**KEY DECISION POINTS:**

**Bike choice affects race strategy:** "If your mountain bike only carries one bottle, you'll want to make sure you have a hydration bag as well." The only resupply is at Jimna around 73-75km. (https://marathonmtb.com/2024/04/30/bike-choice-sunday-creek-classic/)

**Navigation:** Imogen Smith missed a turn with 10km to go and ended up lost, demonstrating the importance of navigation. (https://marathonmtb.com/2023/06/02/sunday-creek-classic-goosebumps-and-gravel/)

## DNF Risk Factors

**MECHANICAL FAILURES - FLAT TIRES:**

**Mike Blewitt [COMPETITIVE]:** On Sunday Creek Road descent: "we passed two race leaders with terminal flat tyres." (https://marathonmtb.com/2024/04/30/bike-choice-sunday-creek-classic/)

**Imogen Smith [ELITE]:** On Sunday Creek Road: "flats everywhere. That's luck and setup." She used Tubolight EVO gravel tyre inserts as insurance. (https://marathonmtb.com/2024/04/30/bike-choice-sunday-creek-classic/)

**NAVIGATION ERRORS:**

**Imogen Smith [ELITE]:** Missed a left-hander near the end: "When I crossed the line, thinking I'd won, Chris the organiser asked me what I thought of the hike a bike at the end. Um… What hike a bike? I had 121km on the Garmin, the course length, but somewhere my buddy and I had missed a left-hander." She went back to complete it and got completely lost for nearly 40 minutes on increasingly narrow singletrack with lantana. (https://marathonmtb.com/2023/06/02/sunday-creek-classic-goosebumps-and-gravel/)

**BIKE HANDLING ISSUES:**

**Imogen Smith [ELITE]:** "You must be a good bike handler to tackle Sunday Creek Classic on a gravel bike if you want to be competitive. The roadies on their gravel bikes were the riders I saw not having a great day." (https://marathonmtb.com/2024/04/30/bike-choice-sunday-creek-classic/)

**NUTRITION/BONKING:**

**Imogen Smith [ELITE]:** Ran out of adequate nutrition, finishing on "zero solid food" after 6.5+ hours and TSS of 425. When attempting the missed section later, she ran through 3 gels in 40+ minutes of climbing and was "utterly, totally spent" when rescued. (https://marathonmtb.com/2023/06/02/sunday-creek-classic-goosebumps-and-gravel/)

**PHYSICAL DIFFICULTY:**

**Imogen Smith [ELITE]:** On the final missed hike-a-bike section: "hauling my bike over impossible head-high moto ruts" after already completing 121km. (https://marathonmtb.com/2023/06/02/sunday-creek-classic-goosebumps-and-gravel/)

**Race Director Chris Dixon:** "Expect this to be tough, very tough – this event is only for those who can race and complete a hard core challenge. There will be minimal support during large sections of the event. You will be expected to be self sufficient and carry your own water and nutrition for long sections of the course." (https://www.gravelclassics.com.au/about-sunday-creek-classic)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**PRE-RACE:**

Riders camp at Kenilworth showgrounds for $20 unpowered site with toilets and showers. "Many headed to its famous bakery to fuel up before setting off." 7am start time, "chilly" morning where riders "stripped down to jerseys and bibs." (https://marathonmtb.com/2023/06/02/sunday-creek-classic-goosebumps-and-gravel/ and https://bq.org.au/where-to-rides/sunday-creek-gravel-loop/)

**DURING RACE:**

**Lizzie Hepple [ELITE]:** "The support crews at the checkpoints were fantastic. I met a few old friends at the event and made new ones." (https://www.gravelclassics.com.au/news/the-sunday-creek-classic-the-most-challenging-single-day-ride-in-australia)

**Imogen Smith [ELITE]:** Described riding with Eve Conyers and male passengers: "the day felt like the best kind of training ride: hard, scenic, and with excellent conversation."

**Ryan Cavanagh [ELITE]:** "The scenery and views surrounding Kenilworth were truly spectacular and definitely helped take my mind off the suffering." (https://www.gravelclassics.com.au/news/the-sunday-creek-classic-the-most-challenging-single-day-ride-in-australia)

**POST-RACE:**

**Imogen Smith [ELITE]:** Despite not officially finishing: "The ladies got me up on the podium anyway for a photo. Character!" (https://marathonmtb.com/2023/06/02/sunday-creek-classic-goosebumps-and-gravel/)

**Lizzie Hepple [ELITE]:** "I'll keep working on my gravel bike skills, and 'hike-a-bike' fitness, so I can come back next year and do it all again!" (https://www.gravelclassics.com.au/news/the-sunday-creek-classic-the-most-challenging-single-day-ride-in-australia)

Post-race opportunity to "refresh and refuel" in Kenilworth, particularly at the famous bakery. (https://marathonmtb.com/2024/04/30/bike-choice-sunday-creek-classic/)

**COMMUNITY CHARACTERIZATION:**

**Imogen Smith [ELITE]:** On why people race: "We're kind to strangers. We share suffering. We build each other up. That's what was cool about racing at Sunday Creek." (https://marathonmtb.com/2023/06/02/sunday-creek-classic-goosebumps-and-gravel/)

First edition (2021) had 65 riders. Event described as welcoming riders "warmly" to Kenilworth. (https://www.gravelclassics.com.au/news/the-sunday-creek-classic-the-most-challenging-single-day-ride-in-australia)
