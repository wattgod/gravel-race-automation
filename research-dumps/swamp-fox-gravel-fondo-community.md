## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Heather Hart [COMPETITIVE]:** "I can tell you that this race was one of the hardest things I've ever done. Sure, 177.6 miles is a long way to ride your bike, but we kept our effort in an easy Z1 and below the entire time. So the 'fitness' portion of this event was really not that bad. It was everything else."

**Heather Hart [COMPETITIVE]:** "The first 30 miles flew by...We were feeling good and moving along well above our goal pace. Seriously, who knew 20 extra psi in your tires could make such a difference."
(https://relentlessforwardcommotion.com/2025-moultrie-militia-gravel-raid-race-report/)

**Heather Hart [COMPETITIVE]:** "The Francis Marion National Forest – or 'the Swamp' as we lovingly refer to it – has become one of my most favorite places on earth. And if you can believe it, it's even more magical at night. We traversed down endless dirt and gravel roads...Most of the roads were in prime condition for riding, fast and smooth. Some were a little sandier than ideal (Old Georgetown road, I'm looking at you)."

**Heather Hart [COMPETITIVE]:** "About halfway down Hell Hole Road A (OF COURSE it was HHRA) – I somehow managed to drop my chain in a way that it got caught between the frame and the small front chain ring...The chain was so jammed in there it took Geoff at least 5 minutes to get it unstuck."
(https://relentlessforwardcommotion.com/2025-moultrie-militia-gravel-raid-race-report/)

**Heather Hart [COMPETITIVE]:** On the 11 PM start: "I'll be the first to admit that an 11 pm start is certainly rough, especially when you're an old lady like me who likes to be in bed by 8 pm and values her sleep...Nevertheless, this was not my first overnight rodeo, and the excitement of what was to come kept me alert and awake."

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Tire Pressure [COMPETITIVE — Heather Hart]:** "I finally put the correct amount of air pressure in my tires (turns out, 35psi is only ideal for my mountain bikes, who knew)...Seriously, who knew 20 extra psi in your tires could make such a difference." She ran approximately 55 psi for the gravel course with significant improvement in speed.

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Surface Conditions:** "Most of the roads were in prime condition for riding, fast and smooth. Some were a little sandier than ideal (Old Georgetown road, I'm looking at you) and others were the hilarious type of chaos I've come to expect from the FMNF. Like – like Forest Murrell Road – which is slowly being reabsorbed by the forest itself."
(https://relentlessforwardcommotion.com/2025-moultrie-militia-gravel-raid-race-report/)

**Specific Problem Areas:** Hell Hole Road A (HHRA) was noted as particularly problematic — a rider dropped their chain badly on this section, requiring 5+ minutes to fix.
(https://relentlessforwardcommotion.com/2025-moultrie-militia-gravel-raid-race-report/)

**Course Familiarity:** The Francis Marion National Forest roads are used by multiple events including Eagle Endurance/Palmetto Ultras running races and Swamp Fox Adventure Race, making them familiar to local endurance athletes.

**Wildlife Encounters:** Barred Owls are active and vocal on the course at night. One rider used the Merlin app to identify them during a mechanical stop.

**Remote Nature:** "We are on one of the most remote roads out there" (Hell Hole Road A area). Cell phone reception is not guaranteed in the forest.

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Pacing Strategy [COMPETITIVE — Heather Hart for 177.6-mile MMGR]:** "We kept our effort in an easy Z1 and below the entire time." The focus was on finishing and having fun rather than racing hard.
(https://relentlessforwardcommotion.com/2025-moultrie-militia-gravel-raid-race-report/)

**Early Race Positioning [COMPETITIVE]:** For the MMGR with only 16 starters: "Geoff and I were IMMEDIATELY – within seconds – dropped from the ENTIRE rest of the pack. We were dropped so fast I stopped seeing their blinking red tail lights after the first half mile. This didn't bother me in the slightest, as my only goals for this race were to a) finish, and b) have a fun adventure."
(https://relentlessforwardcommotion.com/2025-moultrie-militia-gravel-raid-race-report/)

**Water/Aid Strategy:** First gas station crossed the course at mile 30, but riders with adequate capacity chose not to stop, saving a half-mile round trip detour.
(https://relentlessforwardcommotion.com/2025-moultrie-militia-gravel-raid-race-report/)

**Mental Preparation:** "An 11 pm start is certainly rough, especially when you're an old lady like me who likes to be in bed by 8 pm...Nevertheless, this was not my first overnight rodeo, and the excitement of what was to come kept me alert and awake."
(https://relentlessforwardcommotion.com/2025-moultrie-militia-gravel-raid-race-report/)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Mechanical Issues:** Chain drop/jam was a race-threatening mechanical on Hell Hole Road A. The chain got so jammed between frame and small chainring it took 5+ minutes to extract and required cable adjustments afterward.
(https://relentlessforwardcommotion.com/2025-moultrie-militia-gravel-raid-race-report/)

**Self-Sufficiency Requirements:** "Riders should be prepared to fix anything that may come their way (flats, mechanicals, etc). The forest is remote and cell phone reception is not guaranteed. Please plan accordingly...There is no SAG wagon to pick you up. If you leave the course, we may not be able to find you."
(https://www.mtpleasantvelo.org/swampfoxgravelfondo)

**2024 100-Mile DNF Rate:** 4 DNFs out of 58 starters (approximately 7% DNF rate) in the 100-mile event.
