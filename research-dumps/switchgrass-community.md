# SWITCHGRASS — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Graham 'Bush' Muir [RECREATIONAL]:** "The XL takes place in the Flint Hills of Kansas... this might be the most beautiful place in America... the tallgrass prairie rolls out deep green on every side, the land rising and falling to a faraway horizon... the big bluestem and the wild alfalfa and the switchgrass and the Indian grass and the buffalo grass waving and swaying in the wind." Notes that despite people saying Kansas is flat, "19k of climbing is not flat." (https://www.themaniclab.com/posts/unbound-gravel-xl-2021)

The course required riders to "rely solely on their Garmin to get to the finish line. There were no event signs marking turns from roads to dirt paths or grass trails to gravel. No streamers on single-track, no flagging, just you and your GPS." No aid stations—"self-service event" with multiple service stations where riders could stock up on snacks and drinks.

**Graham 'Bush' Muir [RECREATIONAL]:** After only 40 miles into the race, he was "plugging a hole in my first flat of the race." (https://www.themaniclab.com/posts/unbound-gravel-xl-2021)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Graham 'Bush' Muir [RECREATIONAL]:** Rode a Salsa Cutthroat with 1x11 drivetrain, 36 oval chainring front, 11-46 cassette rear, ENVE carbon wheels, and Panaracer GravelKing SK+ 50mm tires. Notes the bike "was built up for the long haul not for speed." Made pre-race changes including "a new seat post two days before the start of the race and would be wearing new, week-old shoes to boot" — going against conventional wisdom but accepting personal responsibility.

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Graham 'Bush' Muir [RECREATIONAL]:** "My plan, as always, is do what you have to do to get to the finish line on time, in one piece and don't be a dick." Started at back of pack at a manageable pace, not wanting to "get caught up in someone else's race." Had to maintain "10mph average pace that I needed to sustain for a full day and a half in order to finish before the cut-off." At the 250-mile marker with "still 100+ to go and the clock says you have 12 hours to do it in." (https://www.themaniclab.com/posts/unbound-gravel-xl-2021)

**Nutrition - Graham 'Bush' Muir [RECREATIONAL]:** Changed hydration plan last minute after "talking to the creator of Skratch Labs for half an hour at the Unbound Gravel Expo the day before the race." Averaged 250 calories/hour intake. Being "pretty fat-adapted, so I can run pretty lean if necessary." Consumed: numerous sandwiches with cheese and salami, peanut butter and honey, 3 Trail Butter pouches (800 calories each), plus items from service stations. Notes it "was a bit difficult to find anything that I wanted to eat at those." (https://www.themaniclab.com/posts/unbound-gravel-xl-2021)

**Caffeine Strategy - Graham 'Bush' Muir [RECREATIONAL]:** Used caffeine gum to stay focused through the night, "drip feed by chewing a new piece of gum every 30 minutes, each piece containing 40 mgs" until he "dropped my bag of synthetic energy into the night. Good thing it was almost sunrise." (https://www.themaniclab.com/posts/unbound-gravel-xl-2021)

## Weather Experienced

**2021 Race - Graham 'Bush' Muir [RECREATIONAL]:** Temps in the mid-80s at start (3:00 PM start time). "The heat got my attention." Sunrise was "spectacular and brought my energy back" but "a few hours later the mercury started cranking back up again." (https://www.themaniclab.com/posts/unbound-gravel-xl-2021)

## Training & Preparation

**Graham 'Bush' Muir [RECREATIONAL]:** Followed 80/20 training protocol by Dr. Stephen Siler: "80% of my time training... is in Zone 2, a low intensity push where my heart rate is around 60% of its max. The remaining 20%... is spent in Zones 4 and 5" primarily in the gym. Notes he's a "50 year-old former professional rugby player" and "constant hard intervals that numerous protocols call for do not suit" him. Winter training on fat bike in Steamboat Springs, Colorado. Longest pre-race ride was only 106 miles, "which, before the game day, had me worried." (https://www.themaniclab.com/posts/unbound-gravel-xl-2021)

**Taper Strategy - Graham 'Bush' Muir [RECREATIONAL]:** Two weeks before start, focused on "the greatest taper possible: organic whole-food nutrition, recovery massages and visits to the chiropractor, and only a few mellow rides... No sessions in the gym and no high intensity training." Believes "this tactical taper was probably the difference between my XL finish and a DNF. My tank just kept on giving when I thought that I may start to stumble." (https://www.themaniclab.com/posts/unbound-gravel-xl-2021)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Graham 'Bush' Muir [RECREATIONAL]:** "I got to ride intermittently with a couple of gentlemen which kept up my speed. Joe was on a single speed and Tyler was on a bike with only a front brake working, so any 'wah-wah-poor-me' moments didn't hold any water." At service stations: "It was more of a break and have a chat with anyone within range; sometimes tricky when people were in there own little caves and then some funny talker is asking how they are holding up."
