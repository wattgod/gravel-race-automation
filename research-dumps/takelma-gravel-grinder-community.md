## Race Strategy & Pacing

(https://www.granfondoguide.com/Contents/Index/7641/)

**Pacing Context from 2025 Results:**
- Elite men's range: 2:52:06 - 2:58:40

The significant time spread (2:52 to 4:47+) suggests riders should plan nutrition and pacing for their own level rather than following elite strategy.

Takelma is the traditional language of the Cow Creek Band of Umpqua Tribe of Indians. The race name and associated Takelma Roasting coffee company represent "an extension of their cultural connection to people and place." Every roasting profile has a Takelma word associated with it as "a way to honor our history and culture, as well as spark a new conversation with every cup of coffee."
