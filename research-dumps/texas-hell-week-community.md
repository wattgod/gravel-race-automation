# TEXAS HELL WEEK — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Event Structure & Format

**Texas Hell Week** has been an early season tradition since 1991, created by Nick Gerlich, an avid cyclist and associate professor at West Texas A&M University. The event was designed for riders from the Upper Midwest seeking warm weather early-season riding after long winters. Originally held in San Marcos, it moved to Fredericksburg in 1994 due to increasing traffic in the Austin area.

The event runs for 7 days, offering **3 daily rides** of varying distances:
- Short: approximately 30-50 miles
- Medium: approximately 50-80 miles  
- Long: approximately 60-100 miles

**Total of 21 rides** over the week, with every ride on different routes — participants never ride the same road twice. Riders can choose any rides they want and ride at any speed, alone or with friends. The event is **non-competitive** during Hell Week itself (https://www.raamchallenge.com/about).

Evening instructional seminars are offered on coaching, nutrition, and crewing (https://www.endurancesportswire.com/texas-hell-week-joins-raam-family-of-events/).

After Texas Hell Week concludes, the **Stampede 200** (200-mile race) and **Longhorn 500** (500-mile RAAM qualifier race) take place, creating a 10-day Spring cycling super-event (https://www.raamchallenge.com/races).

## Location & Terrain Details

**Fredericksburg, Texas** — heart of the Texas Hill Country. The area features nearly 1,000 miles of paved roads with minimal traffic through seven counties south of the Colorado River (https://wheelbrothers.com/2012/01/07/cycling-fredericksburg-the-texas-hill-country/).

**Terrain characteristics from the Longhorn 500 course descriptions** (which uses the same road network):

- **Edwards Plateau**: The dominant geological feature, with routes frequently climbing onto and dropping off this plateau
- **Elevation gain rates**: Courses average 47-53 ft/mile of elevation gain, generally concentrated in major climbs rather than constant rolling
- **River crossings**: Multiple rivers dissect the area including the Guadalupe, Medina, Sabinal, Frio, Nueces, Colorado, and Pedernales
- **Major climbs**: Individual climbs range from 100-800 feet
- **Water crossings**: "Many cattle guards and water crossings" noted on northern routes
- **One short unpaved section** mentioned on the Spicewood Loop
- **Very little traffic**: "No major highways, very little traffic" (https://www.raamchallenge.com/races)

The terrain is described as "moderately difficult - ideally suited to advanced beginning to intermediate level ultra-racers" for the racing events (https://www.raamchallenge.com/races).

## Weather Experienced

**Spring timing (mid-March to mid-April):**
- Temperature range: Generally 50-80°F
- Mornings can be foggy with clearing by afternoon
- **Wildflowers in bloom**: Blue Bonnets and Indian Paint Brush are the highlight of riding during this period
- Weather is described as "perfect" for this time of year (https://www.raamchallenge.com/races, https://mapmagic.app/blog/2023/12/28/top-5-cycling-races-and-events-in-the-united-states/)

## Historical Context

The event had a 2-year hiatus before 2017, then the last Texas Hell Week was held in 2017. After negotiations between Nick Gerlich and RAAM management (Fred and Rick Boethling), RAAM acquired the event and brought it back, combining it with their existing Texas RAAM Challenge races to create the current super-event format starting in 2022 (https://www.endurancesportswire.com/texas-hell-week-joins-raam-family-of-events/, https://www.raamchallenge.com/about).

**RAAM Executive Director Rick Boethling's statement**: "We are extremely pleased to have reached an agreement with Nick. Our goal has been to create an early season cycling super-event. We are proud to bring Texas Hell Week back … to insure the tradition continues" (https://www.endurancesportswire.com/texas-hell-week-joins-raam-family-of-events/).
