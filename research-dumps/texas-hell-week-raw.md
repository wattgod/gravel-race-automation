**Note**: Texas Hell Week is a **week-long riding camp**, not a single-stage gravel race; limited gravel-specific details (focus on road/Hill Country routes). Much data from raamchallenge.com (official); 2026 schedules partial/inferred. No Reddit/forums/YouTube/reviews in results; airport/lodging sparse. User location (Warda) unmatched—possibly confuses with nearby Stampede 200[1][2][3][4][6][7].
