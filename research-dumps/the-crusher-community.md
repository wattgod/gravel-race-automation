# THE CRUSHER — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Greg Gentle [RECREATIONAL]:** "I've never ridden that far before. Horrible idea or not, I'm committed. The Crusher Gravel Race will send about 150 brave souls across the wilderness of the Keweenaw Peninsula in route to Marquette. The Crusher brags 225 miles of 'enhanced gravel' promising to deliver one of the hardest days on the bike you'll ever experience." (https://fat-bike.com/2019/08/the-crusher-race-report-by-greg-gentle/)

**Greg Gentle [RECREATIONAL]:** "My goal was to ride straight through aiming for 20 hours. To do that I need to ride about an average of 13 mph knowing there will be some stops along the way." He ended up finding his pace slower than expected: "Eighteen miles in. Eighteen miles! That's it? My ambitious 12MPH pace was being buried in sand. I was two hours in at this point and it was going to be a much longer day than expected." (https://fat-bike.com/2019/08/the-crusher-race-report-by-greg-gentle/)

**Greg Gentle [RECREATIONAL]:** "Most racers arrived at the Noque Trail Head in Forestville Friday. After check-in including a vigorous gear check by volunteers, most riders opted for a hell-bound shuttle on a cramped and hot school bus to Copper Harbor. Todd likes his event attendees to experience pain and discomfort, so he must have figured this was as good a place as any to start your suffering." (https://fat-bike.com/2019/08/the-crusher-race-report-by-greg-gentle/)

**Greg Gentle [RECREATIONAL]:** "After about 10 miles we hit some gnarly downhill sections. I know to get myself to the front of these situations and was able to bomb it with another rider leaving the group behind. There were water bottles and other 'I'm going to need that later' items littered yard sale fashion all over the trail for the next few miles ejected from bikes and bags from other riders ahead of us. It was steep, rocky, and fast. Pick the wrong line and you are in trouble." (https://fat-bike.com/2019/08/the-crusher-race-report-by-greg-gentle/)

**Greg Gentle [RECREATIONAL]:** On aid stations: "Houghton was an oasis of joy. There was a huge spread of food and drink to load up on, and more importantly, a bathroom to finish some #unfinishedbusiness. The crew of volunteers was super friendly and supportive." (https://fat-bike.com/2019/08/the-crusher-race-report-by-greg-gentle/)

**Greg Gentle [RECREATIONAL]:** "I don't care if that's your race game, or not. If you're in a group for 5+ hours and you don't take a turn you're dead to me. Okay…that's a little harsh. Let's just say I don't have a lot of respect for you as a rider. Do some work. Pull your weight." (https://fat-bike.com/2019/08/the-crusher-race-report-by-greg-gentle/)

**Matt Miller [COMPETITIVE]:** "For the first hour, I didn't see anyone else. Usually in Colorado, if you're riding and need help, you only have to wait a few minutes for someone to pass by. Not here." (https://www.singletracks.com/mtb-trails/getting-lost-in-the-up-a-solo-mission-to-finish-the-crusher-gravel-race/)

**Matt Miller [COMPETITIVE]:** "I pulled over and checked my data while I ground up an energy bar in my mouth. Eighteen miles in. Eighteen miles! That's it? My ambitious 12MPH pace was being buried in sand. I was two hours in at this point and it was going to be a much longer day than expected." (https://www.singletracks.com/mtb-trails/getting-lost-in-the-up-a-solo-mission-to-finish-the-crusher-gravel-race/)

**Matt Miller [COMPETITIVE]:** "Between miles 25 and 52, I climbed more roads and descended into hidden 4x4 and snowmobile trails where I was glad to have flat bars instead of drops. Every time I thought I was getting closer to the Forestville Trailhead, another climb emerged, adding a few more hundred feet of elevation gain and weight to my legs." After six hours of riding, he noted the mental challenge: "Part of me wished I'd brought my headphones so I could listen to a podcast. Instead, I sat with the uncomfortable silence in my head. Much of the race experience that mountain bikers and cyclists have is defined by the atmosphere and by commiserating companions that we ride next to, and encourage, and compete with. Their energy becomes our energy and vice versa. Without other people, it turns into a long ride by yourself and you'd better hope that you have enough grit and mental tenacity to keep turning the pedals because the frogs aren't going to cheer you on." (https://www.singletracks.com/mtb-trails/getting-lost-in-the-up-a-solo-mission-to-finish-the-crusher-gravel-race/)

**Josh Berry [UNKNOWN]** (in pre-race interview): "Crusher in the Tushar. It's the shortest one too. But the climb just keeps coming and coming, It will rain, it will be hot, it will be windy, and that is just on the first climb. I did well once, that might be all I have." (https://www.cxmagazine.com/gravel-preview-2019-crushar-tushar-riders-watch-women-men)

**Mindy McCutcheon [ELITE]** (2015 Crusher in the Tushar): "When it came to descending, I quickly ran out of gears. Crap, I didn't think about my gearing going downhill, I was only worried about the uphill! I was pedaling as fast as I could, but Robin quickly drifted out of sight." (https://www.cxmagazine.com/crusher-tushar-race-report-results-cyclocross-gravel-race/2)

**Mindy Caruso [ELITE]** (2015 Crusher in the Tushar): "I didn't really know the time gaps between first-place (Farina), myself, and third place (McCutcheon) but I just went into time-trial mode and pushed it from there. As I passed about five miles to go they told me there was about a two minute gap to the leader, just I just hit it as hard as I could on that last little descent and the final climb up to the finish." (https://www.cxmagazine.com/crusher-tushar-race-report-results-cyclocross-gravel-race/2)

**Wojtek [COMPETITIVE]** (2019 Chief Silvernail Crusher Race): "Team Orange participated for the third consecutive time this year in force of 44 athletes and complete novices. Wa are an international bunch: participants from China, Thailand, Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Haiti Poland and the US have participated. As always, The Crusher offered a good challenge to each one of our team members. It was amazing to watch our employees bond, while putting their minds and muscles to overcome obstacles, making friends with local contestants and experience the magic of the good all American 'you can do it' for themselves." (https://www.mudrunguide.com/organizers/crusher-race/)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Bike Choice [RECREATIONAL - Greg Gentle]:** Used a bike provided by race organizer Todd Poquette for the 225-mile Michigan Crusher: "a plus-tired Salsa Timberjack hardtail." Poquette "mentioned that there would be enough sand on the course that the plus tires would be worth it." (https://fat-bike.com/2019/08/the-crusher-race-report-by-greg-gentle/)

**Gear Check Requirements [ALL LEVELS]:** "After check-in including a vigorous gear check by volunteers" - the race requires carrying all items on a mandatory gear list, including unusual items: "You have to carry all the shit on the required list (including a snorkel)." (https://fat-bike.com/2019/08/the-crusher-race-report-by-greg-gentle/)

**Nutrition Carried [COMPETITIVE - Matt Miller]:** For the Michigan Crusher, packed "a bunch of Honey Stingers, some Sour Patch Kids, granola bars, a mask, a credit card and ID (just in case), and had a bottle of water and Vitamin Water on the bike. Oh, and a multi-tool, a tube and patch kit, and GoPro." (https://www.singletracks.com/mtb-trails/getting-lost-in-the-up-a-solo-mission-to-finish-the-crusher-gravel-race/)

**Budget Build [RECREATIONAL - PharmD]:** Built a Crusher bike for exactly $2,000 with these components:
- On-One Dirty Disco Frame 54cm
- Avid BB7 Road Disc Brakes
- 50/34 Shimano 105 Crankset with SRAM Apex 11-32 Cassette
- Stan's Alpha 340 Road Disc Wheelset (1500g, 32 spokes)
- Schwalbe Sammy Slick 700x35 Folding Tires
(https://www.bikeforums.net/cyclocross-gravelbiking-recreational/835152-crusher-tushar-bike.html)

**Gearing Warning [RECREATIONAL preparing for Crusher in the Tushar]:** Erik_A advised: "Unless you are semi-pro, your 34 front/ 32 rear won't be enough. Before you install the crank, go for a MTB triple (w/ granny gear) for the mountain climbs. After the race, swap the crank for the 50/34 for 'normal' use." This was in response to someone planning a 50/34 with 11-32 cassette for the Tushar's 10,000 feet of climbing. (https://www.bikeforums.net/cyclocross-gravelbiking-recreational/835152-crusher-tushar-bike.html)

**Tire Clearance [UNKNOWN - PharmD]:** On the On-One Dirty Disco frame: "As for the tires I will be running 700x35 but I have seen others run 38mm and maybe 40mm." (https://www.bikeforums.net/cyclocross-gravelbiking-recreational/835152-crusher-tushar-bike.html)

**GPS Requirement [ALL LEVELS]:** "Signage: There is none. GPS is required." This applies to all Crusher formats (Mass Start, P2P, and EX). For the P2P format: "Satellite communication devices are recommended for this event. I.E. Garmin Inreach, etc." (https://906adventureteam.com/mountain-bike-events/the-crusher/)

## Weather Experienced

No specific weather reports from actual race experiences were found in the provided sources. The sources contain forecasts and general warnings but no rider accounts of actual weather encountered during specific years.

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Michigan Crusher - Early Course [RECREATIONAL]:** "The roads in the UP are loose with silty sand, void of cars. I noticed a few small houses and trailers pushed into the woods, twenty yards off the road. On both sides of me were rocky hills, and maple trees, and oaks, and birches that spread into each other and band together to form a canopy. Compared to the piney forests I'm used to in Colorado, I was made in the shade with a natural tarp. The climbs were more moderate and hilly instead of straight up and miserable." (https://fat-bike.com/2019/08/the-crusher-race-report-by-greg-gentle/)

**Michigan Crusher - Technical Sections [RECREATIONAL]:** "After about 10 miles we hit some gnarly downhill sections... There were water bottles and other 'I'm going to need that later' items littered yard sale fashion all over the trail for the next few miles ejected from bikes and bags from other riders ahead of us. It was steep, rocky, and fast. Pick the wrong line and you are in trouble." The downhill section ended with "a long stretch of blacktop" along Lac La Belle. (https://fat-bike.com/2019/08/the-crusher-race-report-by-greg-gentle/)

**Michigan Crusher - Mid-Course [COMPETITIVE]:** "I passed over streams and rivers, and marshes and across boardwalks before hitting a piece of straightaway road for a few miles that led me to a logging area... I rode through the logging area and heard machines making stumps behind the walls of trees. The dirt road was rutted out with puddles and pools so I weaved between them and watched frogs jump deeper into the water to avoid me." (https://www.singletracks.com/mtb-trails/getting-lost-in-the-up-a-solo-mission-to-finish-the-crusher-gravel-race/)

**Michigan Crusher - Later Sections [COMPETITIVE]:** "Between miles 25 and 52, I climbed more roads and descended into hidden 4x4 and snowmobile trails where I was glad to have flat bars instead of drops." (https://www.singletracks.com/mtb-trails/getting-lost-in-the-up-a-solo-mission-to-finish-the-crusher-gravel-race/)

**Crusher in the Tushar - Surface [ELITE]:** "The 69-mile course through the remote wilderness areas of Utah's little-known Tushar Mountains and Fishlake National Forest features a near-perfect 50/50 split of paved and dirt roads spanning two counties and approximately 10,000 vertical feet of climbing, before finishing at Eagle Point Ski Resort, with a summit just under 10,400'." (https://www.cxmagazine.com/crusher-tushar-race-report-results-cyclocross-gravel-race/2)

**Crusher in the Tushar - First Climb [ELITE]:** "As the group approached the first climb, Mindy Caruso (Nero Veloce) launched the first attack, bringing Robin Farina and Mindy McCutcheon with her. The three riders drilled it up the climb to Betenson Flat" followed by "the descent of 153" where descending skills made a major difference. (https://www.cxmagazine.com/crusher-tushar-race-report-results-cyclocross-gravel-race/2)

**Crusher OCR - Obstacle Details [COMPETITIVE]:** "You start by running the Crusher with your friends, but as their adventure ends it's time to get serious... We have extended your course for several more miles and designed obstacles that WILL crush you." For the Colossal Crusher (Elite): "Part 1) Strength – You start by moving through various stations of functional fitness. Squats, Burpees, Push Ups, Sandbags, Kettle bells." The reviewer noted: "They started you with burpees in the mud! They used the terrain to the best of their ability by making you haul tires up the muddy hills." (https://www.mudrunguide.com/organizers/crusher-race/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Pacing Strategy [RECREATIONAL - Greg Gentle, ~150W estimated]:** Planned to average 13 mph for 20 hours on the 225-mile Michigan Crusher, but found reality different: "My ambitious 12MPH pace was being buried in sand. I was two hours in at this point and it was going to be a much longer day than expected." After 18 miles in 2 hours (9 mph average), he realized his initial pacing was unrealistic for the terrain. (https://fat-bike.com/2019/08/the-crusher-race-report-by-greg-gentle/)

**Aid Station Strategy [RECREATIONAL]:** "I've ridden 150 gravel miles before and completed the Marji Gesick twice, so I know what a long day on the bike feels like... The Marji has prepared me for a few things. First, don't lag around the checkpoints and aid stations. Keep moving." However, at the L'Anse aid station (160 miles): "I asked Lisa how many riders had come through. She wasn't sure, but one of the guys there was checking in riders. He heard my question and did a quick count and said, 'About 14'. Holy shit!! I downed my second hotdog and started on a coke when the group of about 15 we dusted after Freda rolled in with another small group shortly behind. All of sudden the aid station was buzzing with about 20 racers. I looked at Chicago Steve, 'We gotta go now!'" (https://fat-bike.com/2019/08/the-crusher-race-report-by-greg-gentle/)

**Group Dynamics [RECREATIONAL]:** "In races like this, you try to size up other riders that you think you can ride with. Chicago Steve was definitely my bro." Later: "After about 30 minutes they were in sight. I didn't want to overcook the chase knowing I'll need those matches later so, we just kept a steady pace for another hour and caught them." And on the final sections after 175 miles: "Chicago Steve is now Super Steve because the guy still had amazing power. In fact, it was too much for me to stay on his wheel. I let him drift ahead focusing on my breathing and legs to see if I could bring it back. All that work earlier in the day started to catch up to me. After about 2 miles I realized I needed to just ease it back and let him go." (https://fat-bike.com/2019/08/the-crusher-race-report-by-greg-gentle/)

**Pacing Reality Check [COMPETITIVE - Matt Miller]:** Initially thought "I'd take my typical 15MPH road bike average pace, and knock a few Ms off due to the sand and terrain. Even at 11-12MPH, I'd have it in the bag after four-and-a-half hours." Race director's response was "less optimistic" noting "the fastest person had done it in something like three-and-a-half" hours. Miller's actual pace ended up being 9 mph for the first 18 miles (2 hours). (https://www.singletracks.com/mtb-trails/getting-lost-in-the-up-a-solo-mission-to-finish-the-crusher-gravel-race/)

**Crusher in the Tushar - Elite Women's Strategy:** Robin Farina won in 2015 by attacking on descents: "On the descent of 153, Farina plunged down the mountain, leaving McCutcheon and everyone else behind." She finished in 5:01:48, nearly 15 minutes faster than the previous record. Second place Mindy Caruso "went into time-trial mode" after being passed on the descent and "just hit it as hard as I could on that last little descent and the final climb up to the finish," finishing 1:36 behind. (https://www.cxmagazine.com/crusher-tushar-race-report-results-cyclocross-gravel-race/2)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Mechanical Issues [ELITE]:** At the 2019 Dirty Kanza 200 (context for a Crusher racer), Amy Charity "suffered upwards of 8 flats that derailed her strong start to the race" despite having "a torn ACL about a month before" and still attempting the race. (https://www.cxmagazine.com/gravel-preview-2019-crushar-tushar-riders-watch-women-men)

**Injury Risk [ELITE]:** Lauren De Crescenzo, defending 2018 Crusher in the Tushar champion, "will be unable to defend her title after suffering a broken collarbone at the Dirty Kanza 200." (https://www.cxmagazine.com/gravel-preview-2019-crushar-tushar-riders-watch-women-men)

**Gear Selection Consequences [ELITE]:** Mindy McCutcheon at 2015 Crusher: "When it came to descending, I quickly ran out of gears. Crap, I didn't think about my gearing going downhill, I was only worried about the uphill! I was pedaling as fast as I could, but Robin quickly drifted out of sight." This gearing mistake cost her the win. (https://www.cxmagazine.com/crusher-tushar-race-report-results-cyclocross-gravel-race/2)

**Remote Course Risks [ALL LEVELS]:** Race director Todd Poquette's warnings: "You are on your own. No one is out there to save you. GPS is required... We're telling you up front no one is coming to save you. Be prepared. If you're not prepared stay home... There are inherent dangers in activities of this nature that can only be mitigated by preparation, experience, and grit." For the P2P 500-mile format: "You will be alone." (https://906adventureteam.com/mountain-bike-events/the-crusher/)

**Logistical Issues at Other Crusher Events [UNKNOWN]:** At the 2015 St. Louis Crusher OCR, Amanda Powers reported: "unfortunately at this race they only had 2 port a potties, they ran out of the free beer they had at the finish line, they ran out of the swag bags, water cups on the course, water bottles, and the glass that they give as a finishers medal." (https://www.mudrunguide.com/organizers/crusher-race/)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Pre-Race Atmosphere [RECREATIONAL]:** "On a typical non-pandemic year we gather en masse to celebrate adventure and individual accomplishments for an entire weekend. There are hundreds of people, vendors and food, and booze of course." Race director Todd Poquette described the event philosophy: "If your event starts at 5:30am, you are on the clock when the clock strikes 5:30am. If you're in the bathroom, cool – take your time but the clock is ticking." (https://fat-bike.com/2019/08/the-crusher-race-report-by-greg-gentle/)

**Shuttle Experience [RECREATIONAL]:** "Most racers arrived at the Noque Trail Head in Forestville Friday. After check-in including a vigorous gear check by volunteers, most riders opted for a hell-bound shuttle on a cramped and hot school bus to Copper Harbor. Todd likes his event attendees to experience pain and discomfort, so he must have figured this was as good a place as any to start your suffering." (https://fat-bike.com/2019/08/the-crusher-race-report-by-greg-gentle/)

**Mission and Philosophy:** Race director Todd Poquette: "Our organizational mission is to 'empower people to discover the best version of themselves through outdoor adventure.' We accomplish this goal by creating adventure experiences for people of all ages. Our events promote a self-supported ethos – because we believe individuals must accept responsibility for their outcomes. I think, and our programs and events support this perspective, we should all spend less time judging others and more time competing against ourselves, who we were yesterday, and work toward what we can be tomorrow." The events help fund the 906 Adventure Team, which "gets kids on bikes as part of an after-school program and teaches life lessons on two wheels." (https://www.singletracks.com/mtb-trails/getting-lost-in-the-up-a-solo-mission-to-finish-the-crusher-gravel-race/)

**International Team Participation [COMPETITIVE]:** "Team Orange participated for the third consecutive time this year in force of 44 athletes and complete novices. Wa are an international bunch: participants from China, Thailand, Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Haiti Poland and the US have participated... It was amazing to watch our employees bond, while putting their minds and muscles to overcome obstacles, making friends with local contestants and experience the magic of the good all American 'you can do it' for themselves." (https://www.mudrunguide.com/organizers/crusher-race/)

**Camping at Crusher [ALL LEVELS]:** "Camping: We have rented the entire Trail's End Facility for the weekend of the event. You can camp with us at no cost. When registration opens, we'll ask you to answer questions. Basically, you're telling us if you plan to camp with us or not. From there, you'll need to await further instruction after registration fills up. Camping is offered on a first come, first serve basis." (https://906adventureteam.com/mountain-bike-events/the-crusher/)

**Format Differences:** The event includes Mass Start (community-focused), P2P point-to-point (ultimate challenge), and EX expedition formats. Mass Start is described as: "Mass Start events are about community and doing hard things together... You're not gonna find a better place on Earth to spend a weekend or a better group of people to spend it with." The EX format is characterized as: "No crowds. No dog and pony show. Just you and the challenge in front of ya. You can complete your ride anytime within the three-month window. You will be all alone." (https://906adventureteam.com/mountain-bike-events/the-crusher/)
