## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Matthew Lee [ELITE]:** Led the 2009 Tour Divide from the start, maintaining a 5-hour lead over the chase group by Ovando (mile 486). "His lead grew in part from his early start, as he began his climb up Richmond Peak at 5am whereas the others did not start until 5:45am." (https://tourdivide.org/racer-2009-updates/race_report?page=1)

**Flint and Scarlet Zeigler [RECREATIONAL - 13-year-old and father]:** Completed the full GDMBR in 42 days, averaging more than 70 miles per riding day. Scarlet: "I think I'd like to ride that next year" after watching Lael Wilcox's film. They emphasized this was "a shock to other folks we met along the way—and to me, for that matter." (https://bikepacking.com/plog/just-to-be-with-you-great-divide/)

**Giorgio Dalla Costa [UNKNOWN - Italy Divide participant]:** "A bike frame, a 3T Exploro in this case, that becomes canvas expresses my life choice to accept and be thankful towards Art expressing herself spontaneously, without any compromise, traveling, dreaming, feeling free... challenging myself without the necessity of paying attention to the performance, but with a smile and willing to tell a story." (https://3t.bike/blogs/news/get-creative-my-bike-for-the-divide)

**Michael Hodges [UNKNOWN - Devil on the Divide 50k]:** "30ish miles of lung busting, ridge running, dust eating, trail. The course is truly beautiful in that classic Colorado way." Finished in 6:27:05, placed 13th, just 1:40 behind 9th place. "I was able to push from the gun and keep it on for the full race without any real lows." (https://michael-hodges.com/blog/devil-on-the-divide-50k-race-report/)

**Alexandera Houchin [ELITE]:** Set women's singlespeed Tour Divide record on her 5th attempt, 4th finish. "She chose the wrong gearing for her body and the 34x17 (2:1 ratio) required her to completely change her race strategy." Lowered her 2019 record by two hours. (https://chumbausa.com/blog/2023/7/9/race-report-tour-divide-this-is-what-setting-a-womens-singlespeed-record-looks-like)

**Bethany [UNKNOWN - 2015 Tour Divide]:** On the Wyoming Basin crossing: "I was scared of the basin crossing, mostly of running out of water... I did not want to be out in the basin wearing [arm warmers and leg warmers] and decided I needed to make a very early departure." Started at 2:30am from Atlantic City. "I was chased by a savage white dog guarding some livestock and ran out of water at the base of a hot and exposed climb of nearly 20km." (https://bikingbethany.wordpress.com/2015/08/21/tour-divide-wide-open-space-in-wyoming/)

**Lael Wilcox [ELITE]:** 2019 Tour Divide - scratched after encountering shoe-sucking mud. "While waiting, she saw her women's record pass by and her pink LW record dot would be almost a day ahead by the time conditions were suitable for riding." She raced under unique conditions: asked by race organizer to race without a phone (except for emergencies) while other racers could call loved ones.

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Lachlan Morton [ELITE - Unbound XL winner]:**
- Cannondale SuperSix Evo CX
- Vision Metron handlebars with Vision Speed Extensions for aero advantage
- Vittoria Terreno Dry 38mm tires
- Shimano Dura-ace drivetrain (52/36T x 32/11)
- "The first time they showed up to UNBOUND, he didn't bring aerobars. Once the peloton had broken apart... he had it a lot harder than the guys who had mounted extensions on their bars"
(https://www.efprocycling.com/racing/alex-howes-and-lachlan-morton-are-ready-for-unbound/)

**Alex Howes [ELITE - Unbound]:**
- Opted for traditional Vision Metron integrated bar and stem (no extensions)
- Same Vittoria Terreno Dry 38mm tires
- "should hopefully give him a slight aero advantage while also saving some weight"
(https://www.efprocycling.com/racing/alex-howes-and-lachlan-morton-are-ready-for-unbound/)

**Flint and Scarlet Zeigler [RECREATIONAL]:** "Scarlet and I pack our kit almost identically: the same tents, sleep system, cook system, water, and basic clothing. She is responsible for carrying and maintaining all of her own gear." They emphasized that 30c tires minimum are recommended, "but the winner each year is usually uses a little skinnier tire." (https://bikepacking.com/plog/just-to-be-with-you-great-divide/)

**Alexandera Houchin [ELITE]:** Rode Chumba Yaupon singlespeed with 34x17 gearing (2:1 ratio) for Tour Divide women's singlespeed record. (https://chumbausa.com/blog/2023/7/9/race-report-tour-divide-this-is-what-setting-a-womens-singlespeed-record-looks-like)

## Weather Experienced

**2009 Tour Divide:** "Rain, hail, thunderstorms and deep mud continues to be the main topic of this years race. Over the past few days, the weather has ceased to let up and has made for some very non-ideal conditions on the route. Racers had to trek through nearly 70 miles of deep mud in the Centennial Valley from Lima (mile 878) to Red Rock Pass (mile 948) after the valley received 2 weeks of straight rain. In Big Springs (mile 967), Matt Lee was forced to deal with quarter-inch sized hail, which is beginning to be a near-daily occurance for many of the race leaders." (https://tourdivide.org/racer-2009-updates/race_report?page=1)

**2015 Tour Divide - Wyoming section:** "We awoke to frost covered bikes. Brrr! The next morning we had a very cold ride into Pinedale." Later: "It was very very hot, there were no trees, just oil mining rigs every few kilometer or so... For anyone riding this section in the daylight hours, do not underestimate how much water you need and how tough this section is!" (https://bikingbethany.wordpress.com/2015/08/21/tour-divide-wide-open-space-in-wyoming/)

**2022 Unbound forecast:** "It looks like it's going to be muddy this year... It could rain early on, it could rain in the middle and it could rain at the end." Alex Howes: "We could be looking at a 200-mile ultra running race with bikes." (https://www.efprocycling.com/racing/alex-howes-and-lachlan-morton-are-ready-for-unbound/)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Canada Section (Tour Divide):** "Canada is exciting and, in hindsight, our favorite section of the GDMBR. As we find comfort in the rhythm of touring, we pass pristine creeks, rivers, and lakes, see jagged snow-capped peaks, and ride fun, flowy singletrack." (https://bikepacking.com/plog/just-to-be-with-you-great-divide/)

**Richmond Peak climb (2009):** "Chris, Kurt and Joe decided to make camp at the foot of the climb up the Whitefish Divide at mile 245 while Matt pushed halfway up the Red Meadow Pass climb (mile 280)." (https://tourdivide.org/racer-2009-updates/race_report?page=1)

**Brooks Lake section (Wyoming):** "The road was a little boggy but it was worth it, the views were some of the best of the entire Divide." The alternate route via Fish Lake Mountain: "There was a bit of testing hike-a-bike but at the plateau at the top we were treated to views of mountain ranges in every direction." (https://bikingbethany.wordpress.com/2015/08/21/tour-divide-wide-open-space-in-wyoming/)

**Bard Creek Trail (Devil on the Divide):** "The trail is steep. Very steep. And some of it, or a lot of it, just isn't there. It's called the Bard Creek Trail and lives up to its reputation. It's not easy running... research on Strava about the race... this seven mile stretch had taken people in the 6:30-7:00 range like two and a half hours to complete." (https://michael-hodges.com/blog/devil-on-the-divide-50k-race-report/)

**Wyoming Basin Crossing:** "After so many days of sunburn I was now wearing my arm warmers and full length leg warmers all day for protection. I did not want to be out in the basin wearing those and decided I needed to make a very early departure... The basin crossing to Wamsutter was spectacular... We enjoyed a sunrise of magnificent oranges and reds... Unfortunately after an epic lunch at the Wamsutter 24hr truck stop, the rest of the day to Savery was pretty foul. It was very very hot, there were no trees, just oil mining rigs every few kilometer or so." (https://bikingbethany.wordpress.com/2015/08/21/tour-divide-wide-open-space-in-wyoming/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Matthew Lee [ELITE] - 2009 Tour Divide:** "His lead grew in part from his early start, as he began his climb up Richmond Peak at 5am whereas the others did not start until 5:45am. Moreover, Matt skipped going slightly off-route to Seeley Lake in favor of delaying his resupply 26 miles until he reached Ovando. If the chase group goes to Seeley Lake, Matt will likely gain another 30-45 minutes over the group." (https://tourdivide.org/racer-2009-updates/race_report?page=1)

**Lachlan Morton [ELITE] - Unbound nutrition:** "I'll use the C90 drink mixes and I'll cycle that with the C30 which should give me some more electrolytes if it's hot. I'll try to do that every hour ideally. Then, I'll bring some emergency gels in case I lose a bottle or something between aid stations... trying to consume 90 to 120 grams of carbohydrate per hour." (https://www.efprocycling.com/racing/alex-howes-and-lachlan-morton-are-ready-for-unbound/)

**Alex Howes [ELITE] - Unbound nutrition:** "I'm going to be gelling pretty hard. I'll try to get a few C90s down too but I don't really do too well off of a full day of C90, so the mix of the two will be good. I'll probably go through 10 gels over 10 hours plus the C90s and then mix in some solid food in there, old school." (https://www.efprocycling.com/racing/alex-howes-and-lachlan-morton-are-ready-for-unbound/)

**Michael Hodges [UNKNOWN] - Devil on the Divide 50k:** "I also didn't drink anything on that last stretch. At least not anything of significance. I took maybe three sips in that last nine miles and took in no calories. I think this cost me a minute or two in the last mile and a half... If I had just taken one gel in there or drank a bit more, I'd like to think I could have kept the pace up on the flat sections." Finished in 6:27:05. (https://michael-hodges.com/blog/devil-on-the-divide-50k-race-report/)

**Bethany [UNKNOWN] - Wyoming Basin timing:** "By 2:30am Simon and I were riding out of Atlantic City. The basin crossing to Wamsutter was spectacular and nothing to be worried by that early in the day. We enjoyed a sunrise of magnificent oranges and reds." Day 11 was 259km. (https://bikingbethany.wordpress.com/2015/08/21/tour-divide-wide-open-space-in-wyoming/)

**Flint and Scarlet Zeigler [RECREATIONAL] - Full GDMBR:** "We averaged more than 70 miles (112 kilometers) each riding day... We began our trip with the understanding that, at any time, we could stop and go home. We considered it successful just getting to Canada. The goal became, 'Let's see if we can get to Banff.' Then, 'I think we can make it to the US border.' But somewhere in Montana, Scarlet started making the permanent goal, 'We are headed to Mexico!'" (https://bikepacking.com/plog/just-to-be-with-you-great-divide/)

## DNF Risk Factors

**2009 Tour Divide casualties:** "John Nobile has also been severely sidetracked by intense knee pain. He also backtracked 12 miles to restart his border-to-border time." Speculation on his blog suggested uncertainty about continuing. "If John does scratch, he will be joining Cadet Bryant and Kevin Hall as this year's first race casualties." (https://tourdivide.org/racer-2009-updates/race_report?page=1)

**Weather-related challenges:** "Due to the weather, racers are likely wearing through their drivetrains much faster than previous years, which will likely cause many of them to have to pre-maturely replace them once they get into Colorado." (https://tourdivide.org/racer-2009-updates/race_report?page=1)

**Pre-race mental breakdown:** "Let's not even add in the before-we-even-left-the-house breakdown that left half of us feeling like we might just be getting in over our heads. We have conversations, grant assurances, and heartfelt bridges are built again." (https://bikepacking.com/plog/just-to-be-with-you-great-divide/)

**Resupply issues:** "A popular resupply point at Swan River (mile 354) was discovered to be burned down, likely causing a number of racers to go off-route to Big Fork." Also: "South Pass City is an old ghost town... The man reminded us that there was not much at Atlantic City either... Savery... There was no shop or accommodation. We spoke to the woman who used to run the shop though it had since closed. She had let ACA know many times that the shop was no longer operating, but it is still on the map." (https://tourdivide.org/racer-2009-updates/race_report?page=1 and https://bikingbethany.wordpress.com/2015/08/21/tour-divide-wide-open-space-in-wyoming/)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Tour Divide tracking culture:** "Technology now affords us the ability to stay in touch and keep others informed of our whereabouts from the far reaches of our planet. This is a truth that I often battle with. On the one hand, I crave the solitude and the peace that these tours provide. On the other, I recognize the comfort I feel when I hear from a trusted friend who is multiple time zones away. Our Instagram account has become a way to share snippets of the ride as well as have a way to funnel support from family and friends." (https://bikepacking.com/plog/just-to-be-with-you-great-divide/)

**Devil on the Divide 50k atmosphere:** "The course is marked to perfection, aid stations are well stocked, and it's one of those good ol' races with the old school ultra vibe. Really, everything you can ask for in a backyard ultra." (https://michael-hodges.com/blog/devil-on-the-divide-50k-race-report/)

**Brush Mountain Lodge reputation:** "At Brush Mountain Lodge we stopped for a burger. Great place but we waited what seemed an age for our food... I wanted to continue on to Brush Mountain Lodge so much... Kirsten's famous pancakes... Tomorrow morning we would cross the border into Colorado in the wee hours of the morning, and would pass Brush Mountain Lodge way too early to stop in. Next time through I'll have to stop in to say hi to Kirsten!" (https://bikingbethany.wordpress.com/2015/08/21/tour-divide-wide-open-space-in-wyoming/)

**Self-supported racing ethics debate:** Pre-2019 Tour Divide, a Facebook group post sparked debate: "Racing a self-supported endurance race with a film crew in tow is not self supported endurance racing. Discuss." Over 100 comments debated whether media coverage constitutes support, with some arguing Lael's attempts "would not count because we will be there" and others noting past films like "Ride the Divide" helped grow the race.
