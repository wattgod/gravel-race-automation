# THE EQUALIZER — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Race Overview & Context

**Important Note:** The sources provided contain almost NO information about "THE EQUALIZER" as a gravel/cycling race. Most sources discuss:
- A triathlon "Equalizer" format (battle of the sexes with staggered starts)
- "The Equalizer" films starring Denzel Washington
- Other unrelated events (ultramarathon runs, horse racing, soccer)

Only **TWO sources** contain actual information about THE EQUALIZER gravel race:

1. **BikeSignup listing** - "The EQUALIZER 50K and 100K Gravel Race" in Marthasville, MO
2. **iRace.ai listing** - Same event with brief course description
