# THE GRALLOCH — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Tom Couzens [COMPETITIVE]:** "The Gralloch is tough. There is no denying that. The course is brutal. To paint the picture the first 12 km is nearly all uphill, right out of the blocks... This year the 110km long course was extremely dry and dusty and even though you climb just over 1,700 metres the course was running extremely quick this year. So fast in fact I averaged nearly 32 km/h!" (https://laka.co/gb/blog/uci/racing-the-gralloch-my-experience-at-the-uci-gravel-world-series-in-scotland/)

**Tom Couzens [COMPETITIVE]:** "With the first 12km being nearly all uphill I had one goal, set a pace hard enough that it would dispatch enough riders but not too many that no one would be left to help work together... Gradually increasing the pace the front group slowly got smaller and smaller and as we crested the first climb there were around 30 to 40 riders left." (https://laka.co/gb/blog/uci/racing-the-gralloch-my-experience-at-the-uci-gravel-world-series-in-scotland/)

**Matt Buckley [COMPETITIVE]:** "Despite having been thoroughly beaten up by a very tough course, the overall event was superbly run... I crossed the line in just over 5 hours, well outside of qualifying time. The winner of the men's race completed the course in a hair over 3 hours, so I think my dreams of being a professional cyclist will probably stay just a dream!" (https://www.t3.com/active/cycling/i-rode-the-uks-most-brutal-gravel-race-and-lived-to-tell-the-tale)

**Matt Buckley [COMPETITIVE]:** "Some 20 minutes later, the climb transitioned into the first descent of the day, a twisty yet wide forestry track that had riders littered left and right fixing their bikes. The gravel claimed many tyres throughout the day, but I managed to stay out of any trouble, the mechanical kind at least." (https://www.t3.com/active/cycling/i-rode-the-uks-most-brutal-gravel-race-and-lived-to-tell-the-tale)

**Matt Buckley [COMPETITIVE]:** "It was around 75km that the cramp in my legs started to set in; every gradient became a balancing act between pushing on hard enough and avoiding my left quad spasming, which then required a few minutes off the bike, drinking as much as I could, and pulling some interesting stretches." (https://www.t3.com/active/cycling/i-rode-the-uks-most-brutal-gravel-race-and-lived-to-tell-the-tale)

**Ben Thomas [ELITE]:** "Off the marks, out of the arena, onto the tarmac stretch out of the town, I'm getting shuffled further and further back through the peloton, but just before the left turn onto the first gravel section and first climb I swoop around the outside of those in front and slot into the top 5... We crest the first steep ramp of the climb and I'm actually feeling surprisingly good, others are on the limit and I'm working hard but have more to give." (https://www.benthomascoaching.com/post/gralloch-almost-a-dream-ride)

**Ben Thomas [ELITE]:** "Next climb and Petr Vakoc is in attack mode, he kicks down the gears and forces the power through the pedals, I'm the only one who can go with him and suddenly we are away in the lead of a UCI gravel race. This was unexpected and certainly unplanned. We start building a gap, working well together taking turns, keeping the effort smooth and consistent, threshold on the climbs but I'm recovering quite easily when sitting on the wheel." (https://www.benthomascoaching.com/post/gralloch-almost-a-dream-ride)

**Ben Thomas [ELITE]:** "At the 75km mark I had a lack of energy but thankfully the legs came back 5km later with the help of a group that dragged me to the feed zone at 87km point. I topped up the water bottle and squeezed a few oranges down my neck which was a refreshing change to gels etc." (https://www.benthomascoaching.com/post/gralloch-almost-a-dream-ride)

**Hugo Foulon [ELITE]:** "After 40km of a super fast ride, chasing the leading group with 4/5 very strong fellow racers, unfortunately, I broke my chain. It was due to a projection of a rock between my cassette and my chain. After trying to fix it, removing the twisted part, I saw that the chain was completely twisted. Impossible to repair, I was forced to give up. It's cruel, but it's part of the game." (https://usa.cinelli-milano.com/blogs/news/race-report-hugo-foulon-goes-to-gralloch)

**Michael Newton [UNKNOWN]:** "After last year's puncture issues, I took descents a little bit steadier than normal which seemed to pay off as I had no mechanical issues throughout the race. I kept pushing on the pedals and fuelled what I thought was going to keep me going strong throughout." (https://www.barnsleyroadclub.co.uk/post/gralloch-uci-gravel-2024-111km-race-report)

**Michael Newton [UNKNOWN]:** "At the 75km mark I had a lack of energy but thankfully the legs came back 5km later with the help of a group that dragged me to the feed zone at 87km point. I topped up the water bottle and squeezed a few oranges down my neck which was a refreshing change to gels etc... The atmosphere at the finish was fantastic but unfortunately I couldn't enjoy it as my stomach was feeling dodgy after all the energy food..... definitely need to change my fueling strategy for future events." (https://www.barnsleyroadclub.co.uk/post/gralloch-uci-gravel-2024-111km-race-report)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Tom Couzens [COMPETITIVE]:** Used Hunt 40 Limitless Gravel Aero Wheelset with Pirelli Cinturato RC 45mm tires plus tire inserts to protect rims. "Punctures were a common theme once again at this year's edition of The Gralloch but thanks to the Pirelli Cinturato RC's this wasn't a problem." Ran Sram Force AXS with 44t chainring and 10-44 cassette on a Ribble Gravel SL. (https://laka.co/gb/blog/uci/racing-the-gralloch-my-experience-at-the-uci-gravel-world-series-in-scotland/)

**Tom Couzens [COMPETITIVE]:** "In terms of kit, aerodynamics is key! Saving as many watts as possible translates to more speed with less energy expenditure. With that in mind I used the brand new Sportful Fast Not Fun gravel specific skinsuit, with two convenient cargo pockets to store all of my gels and a race fitting fit." (https://laka.co/gb/blog/uci/racing-the-gralloch-my-experience-at-the-uci-gravel-world-series-in-scotland/)

**Ben Thomas [ELITE]:** Used Schwalbe G One Pro RX 45mm tires: "I nearly come unstuck on one of the descents, smacking a huge rock but luckily my Schwalbe G One Pro RX 45 survives the hit." (https://www.benthomascoaching.com/post/gralloch-almost-a-dream-ride)

**Matt Buckley [COMPETITIVE]:** "The barren landscape offered no respite from the sun, and I became increasingly pleased with my last-minute purchase of a hydration pack. At around 50km in, I'd already drained both bottles on my bike and was getting through the 2L of water in the hydration pack; without it, I'd have been in serious trouble." (https://www.t3.com/active/cycling/i-rode-the-uks-most-brutal-gravel-race-and-lived-to-tell-the-tale)

**General observation from multiple sources:** Tire inserts and robust tire choices are critical. Multiple riders reported punctures and mechanicals, with sharp rocks being a common hazard.

## Weather Experienced

**2025 race conditions:** "This year the 110km long course was extremely dry and dusty" (Tom Couzens, https://laka.co/gb/blog/uci/racing-the-gralloch-my-experience-at-the-uci-gravel-world-series-in-scotland/)

**2025 race conditions:** "Cloudless blue skies and a gentle wind meant temperatures and heat management became an issue. The mercury was nudging 28°C at times, and on some of the climbs it felt more." (Matt Buckley, https://www.t3.com/active/cycling/i-rode-the-uks-most-brutal-gravel-race-and-lived-to-tell-the-tale)

**2026 pre-race Saturday:** "After a long journey up to Scotland on Friday... the sun rose Saturday morning and it was another blue sky day with the sun shining strong." (Ben Thomas, https://www.benthomascoaching.com/post/gralloch-almost-a-dream-ride)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Opening climb specifics:** "The first 12 km is nearly all uphill, right out of the blocks" and is a "6.5km gravel climb leads the race to the highest point of the course at Fuffock Hill. You need to be in the lead group or you aren't catching the fast train to the finish." (Tom Couzens, https://laka.co/gb/blog/uci/racing-the-gralloch-my-experience-at-the-uci-gravel-world-series-in-scotland/)

**Course character:** "For the next 80 kilometers the course dips and dives through the Galloway Forest, taking in the sights before you finally return to the tarmac for the final 10km stretch to the finish line." (Tom Couzens, https://laka.co/gb/blog/uci/racing-the-gralloch-my-experience-at-the-uci-gravel-world-series-in-scotland/)

**Technical section:** "I knew a technical, narrow section was fast approaching as we hit the 40 km mark. Moving up through the group I used my cyclocross skills to my advantage, pushing the pace through this narrow section to go clear. With it being such a narrow few kilometres the hope was that not many would have seen me slip off the front." (Tom Couzens, https://laka.co/gb/blog/uci/racing-the-gralloch-my-experience-at-the-uci-gravel-world-series-in-scotland/)

**Descent from Loch Grannoch:** "The descent from Loch Grannoch was a different beast, however. Fist-sized bits of gravel and relentless corrugations made for very tough going on my already tired body. Choosing the fastest line down the hill had turned into letting go of the brakes and hanging on for dear life." (Matt Buckley, https://www.t3.com/active/cycling/i-rode-the-uks-most-brutal-gravel-race-and-lived-to-tell-the-tale)

**Surface conditions:** "Sharp dagger-like rocks line the course" (Tom Couzens, https://laka.co/gb/blog/uci/racing-the-gralloch-my-experience-at-the-uci-gravel-world-series-in-scotland/)

**Final 10km:** "Around 100km we hit some tarmac, oooooh buttery smooth tarmac mmmmmm. Thankfully it was pretty much all downhill to the finish" (Michael Newton, https://www.barnsleyroadclub.co.uk/post/gralloch-uci-gravel-2024-111km-race-report)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Tom Couzens [COMPETITIVE]:** "90 grams of carbs an hour is my magic number. It's something I've tried a lot in training to find out what works best for me and this is it. Little and often is also key. I've found a Veloforte energy gel every 15 minutes is the perfect gravel race nutrition strategy." Averaged nearly 32 km/h over 110km. (https://laka.co/gb/blog/uci/racing-the-gralloch-my-experience-at-the-uci-gravel-world-series-in-scotland/)

**Tom Couzens [COMPETITIVE]:** "Another thing a lot of people find unusual is I don't have a power meter and ride completely off of feel. I've been doing this for the past 2 years and find it really beneficial for situations such as this and knowing what your body can and cannot handle." (https://laka.co/gb/blog/uci/racing-the-gralloch-my-experience-at-the-uci-gravel-world-series-in-scotland/)

**Ben Thomas [ELITE]:** Fueling strategy from case study: "Ben rolled up to the start line of The Gralloch with one of his most aggressive fueling plans to date: 360g of carbohydrate across just over three hours (including the 30g of carb he had pre-race), which averaged out at ~115g/h." Average heart rate was 164 bpm over 3hrs 8mins. (https://www.precisionhydration.com/athletes/case-studies/cycling/ben-thomas/17-05-2025/)

**Ben Thomas [ELITE]:** Hydration: "Ben didn't leave it to chance. With a well-thought out hydration strategy, which saw him drink a total of ~2.5L of fluid and ~2500mg of sodium" or ~797ml/hour. (https://www.precisionhydration.com/athletes/case-studies/cycling/ben-thomas/17-05-2025/)

**Matt Buckley [COMPETITIVE]:** "In the last 30 minutes, there were a few attacks from the lead group and I could feel the fatigue and cramping on the inside of my quads, but this was more a result of the sprinting." Finished in just over 5 hours. (https://www.t3.com/active/cycling/i-rode-the-uks-most-brutal-gravel-race-and-lived-to-tell-the-tale)

**Opening climb strategy:** "The starting climb starts off very steep and so there is little advantage following someone's wheel so I knew I wanted to be on the front to set the pace to my liking." (Tom Couzens, https://laka.co/gb/blog/uci/racing-the-gralloch-my-experience-at-the-uci-gravel-world-series-in-scotland/)

**Critical tactical moment:** "I knew that this later part of the race would suit a group better than a solo rider thanks to the wider, smoother gravel tracks and so knew I just had to go all in to establish a gap." (Tom Couzens, https://laka.co/gb/blog/uci/racing-the-gralloch-my-experience-at-the-uci-gravel-world-series-in-scotland/)

**Feed zone location:** Feed zone at the 87km point with water, electrolytes, snacks, and oranges. (Multiple sources confirm)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Mechanical failures common:** "Lost bottles, punctures and dropped chains were a common occurrence" (Tom Couzens, https://laka.co/gb/blog/uci/racing-the-gralloch-my-experience-at-the-uci-gravel-world-series-in-scotland/)

**Chain breakage from rocks:** "After 40km of a super fast ride, chasing the leading group with 4/5 very strong fellow racers, unfortunately, I broke my chain. It was due to a projection of a rock between my cassette and my chain." Hugo Foulon was forced to DNF. (https://usa.cinelli-milano.com/blogs/news/race-report-hugo-foulon-goes-to-gralloch)

**Punctures widespread:** "Punctures were a common theme once again at this year's edition of The Gralloch" (Tom Couzens, https://laka.co/gb/blog/uci/racing-the-gralloch-my-experience-at-the-uci-gravel-world-series-in-scotland/)

**Mechanical damage on descents:** "The first descent of the day, a twisty yet wide forestry track that had riders littered left and right fixing their bikes." (Matt Buckley, https://www.t3.com/active/cycling/i-rode-the-uks-most-brutal-gravel-race-and-lived-to-tell-the-tale)

**Heat and hydration:** In hot conditions (28°C), inadequate hydration planning is a major risk. Matt Buckley noted he would have been "in serious trouble" without his hydration pack. (https://www.t3.com/active/cycling/i-rode-the-uks-most-brutal-gravel-race-and-lived-to-tell-the-tale)

**Nutrition bonking:** "At the 75km mark I had a lack of energy" - reported by multiple riders at similar points in the race. (Michael Newton and Ben Thomas)

**Cramping in final 30km:** Multiple riders reported quad cramping in the final third of the race, particularly after hard efforts or attacks.

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Event village:** "The very impressive event village" with talks, rider briefings, expo with bike brands, food trucks, live music, and camping facilities. (Multiple sources)

**Finish line atmosphere:** "The atmosphere at the finish was fantastic" (Michael Newton, https://www.barnsleyroadclub.co.uk/post/gralloch-uci-gravel-2024-111km-race-report)

**Post-race scene:** "A quick shower, lie down, curry and rice and I felt more human. It was great to catch up with other racers, in particular some guys from my hometown in Cumbria who I spent the evening drinking a few ciders with whilst listening to the live band." (Michael Newton, https://www.barnsleyroadclub.co.uk/post/gralloch-uci-gravel-2024-111km-race-report)

**Team atmosphere:** "After years of racing as a privateer and traveling solo to so many events it's amazing to now have the support of a dedicated team staff at each race. Having a mechanic dial in the bike, a team manager planning out each trip, and someone to hand up bottles in feed zones makes a huge difference, not just physically, but mentally." (Ben Thomas, https://www.benthomascoaching.com/post/gralloch-almost-a-dream-ride)

**Women's race format:** "A number of women that I spoke to really valued having separate starts as it felt like their own race, rather than being bolted onto the men's." The standalone women's start received "widespread praise for elevating the level of competition and visibility." (https://www.t3.com/active/cycling/i-rode-the-uks-most-brutal-gravel-race-and-lived-to-tell-the-tale and https://www.granfondoguide.com/Contents/IndexFull/8526/the-gralloch-2025-draws-global-elite-to-galloway-for-uk's-premier-gravel-event)

**International field:** "Welcoming nearly 3,000 riders from 35 nations" in 2025. (https://www.granfondoguide.com/Contents/IndexFull/8526/the-gralloch-2025-draws-global-elite-to-galloway-for-uk's-premier-gravel-event)

**Overall recommendation:** "I would thoroughly recommend this event to anyone who wants to battle it out on the fabulous gravel tracks the area has to offer." (Michael Newton, https://www.barnsleyroadclub.co.uk/post/gralloch-uci-gravel-2024-111km-race-report)
