# THE GRIT ADVENTURE — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Zach V. [UNKNOWN]:** "Honestly, this was one of the best experiences I've had with a gravel event. Incredible course, amazing people, perfect support, and snacks like watermelon at the finish. Literally could not ask for a better experience!" (https://thegrit.bike) - 2025 Fortis Rider

**Patrick E. [UNKNOWN]:** "Such good aid stations and an incredible course." (https://thegrit.bike) - 2025 Maximus Rider

**Todd T. [UNKNOWN]:** "I have ridden a ton of these roads, but very few of the ones included. It was a welcome and amazing, yet challenging surprise!" (https://thegrit.bike) - 2025 Maximus Rider

**Mark M. [UNKNOWN]:** "The course was fun but tough. Organization was great. Aid station nice. People were friendly. And a super great vibe." (https://thegrit.bike) - 2025 Velox Rider

**Mark C. [UNKNOWN]:** "It was a great challenge. I liked the Fortis course. The scenery was great when I could look at it. The location was great, so close to the Seattle area and so close to I-90. The vibe was great, but I would expect nothing less from the organizers." (https://thegrit.bike) - 2025 Fortis Rider

**Martin Criminale [UNKNOWN]:** "Wow, this is an amazing course! So glad to have friends that were up for sharing this experience... This course was designed by and the event is promoted by Off-Camber Productions... in my opinion, it sure lives up to its claim." (https://martin.criminale.com/2022/06/pre-riding-grit-l-course.html)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Martin Criminale [UNKNOWN] - L Course Pre-Ride:**
- **Bike:** Thesis OB1 AXS
- **Gearing:** 42/52 low gear - "would not want to try this course with anything bigger"
- **Tires:** 650x48mm Rene Herse Switchback Hill tires - "would recommend at least 45mm tires"
- **Tire width warning:** One rider used 700x38mm tires but conditions were: "(1) our pace was only moderate and (2) this person's rims are wide and (3) we had perfect conditions/traction. If it's hot and dry 38mm tires will get swallowed by the sand."
- **Fenders:** "I almost never take my fenders off but for this ride, I kept bending the front one when I tried to ride over logs... I recommend not using fenders for this ride because of all the obstacles even though it's nice to keep the mud off. Or just walk your bike over every log."
- **Hydration:** Two large bottles (each with 1.5 scoops HEED and 0.5 scoops Endurolytes Extreme Powder) plus half a bottle of water, refilled once before the last climb. One rider in the group drank two big bottles plus a 70oz reservoir. "If it's hot, bring a filter and perhaps bring a third bottle or pack."

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**From Martin Criminale's L Course Pre-Ride [UNKNOWN]:**

**Course Layout:** "Lollipop" course design - just over 45 miles, took almost 5 hours at moderate pace with short stops (https://martin.criminale.com/2022/06/pre-riding-grit-l-course.html)

**Three Major Climbs:**
1. **First climb:** "comes right out of the gate and is heading out on the stick of the lollipop and was super steep and I never had the energy to take my hands off the bars to take a picture"
2. **Second climb:** "in the loop/body of the lollipop and is not quite as steep and is a little smoother (fewer washboard) too"
3. **Third climb:** "the return trip on the stick of the lollipop and is the most fun. Assuming you still have the energy to enjoy it of course. And assuming it's not a really dry day which would turn this climb into a giant sandbox." Martin's group had "hero sand" conditions due to recent rain - "awesome traction and never spun our rear wheels"

**First Descent:** "So good! You head down a short stretch of dirt road and then turn right into the woods. From here to the bottom it's mostly doubletrack, singletrack, and FUN. You are also in the woods so it's not quite as exposed as the rest of the course. At the bottom of this descent, you cross a creek which is a good source of water in case you need it. I do recommend filtering."

**Second Descent:** "Even better! Is that possible...?! The first part is steep but then it's mostly gradual with lots of water bars, tiny creek crossings, eroded trails, and lush green meadows. You really need to pay attention here as some of the dips and bumps are bigger than you think so don't let it rip."

**Views:** "If the skies are clear, you can see for miles in every direction"

**Trail Character:** From the official description: "Gravel riding meet mountain biking–this is what we call Adventure Gravel. Brutal climbs, tough descents, a bit of double track on a hearty mix of surfaces where your biggest decision is whether to ride your gravel bike on this beast or your hard-tail mountain bike." (https://thegrit.bike)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Water Troughs:** "All the water troughs. Be careful as you approach these as some only have a very narrow section of rideable trail that goes around them and some will require you to get off and walk your bike as the transition at the bottom of the trough is too sudden to ride." (https://martin.criminale.com/2022/06/pre-riding-grit-l-course.html)

**Last Descent Hazards:** "Be warned, this is very steep and you'll be tempted to let go of the brakes on the straight sections but each corner invariable has some washboards and my heart rate spiked more than once when my rear tired locked up as I got air off of a bump. Also, the last part of the descent is paved so you feel like you have ultimate traction but some of the corners are sharp. Watch out." (https://martin.criminale.com/2022/06/pre-riding-grit-l-course.html)

**Trail Obstacles:** "One of the more aggressive 'dips' in the trail" - mentioned in photo captions, suggesting technical features that could catch riders off guard (https://martin.criminale.com/2022/06/pre-riding-grit-l-course.html)
