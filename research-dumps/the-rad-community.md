# THE RAD — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Lauren De Crescenzo [ELITE]:** "I was trying to win the whole race this time. Every time the moto would come by I was like, 'I'm trying to win the overall. That was my goal today.'" She blasted the course, taking second overall by just two minutes, and first in the women's division by more than an hour, spending around 100 miles of the 165-mile race riding alone. At one point, she was only 50 seconds back on John Keller. "It certainly was an exclamation point on the season," De Crescenzo said after her 2021 win, though she crashed and broke her collarbone at the finish line after getting tangled in the running-event-style finishing tape.

**John Keller [ELITE]:** "I am happy everything went right today after Steamboat. The plan was to go in the break. I went hard on the first dirt climb and went over the top alone. I just held what I knew I could do all day based on heart rate and nobody bridged up. The gap was over 10 minutes at one point." Keller spent 155 miles off the front alone in the 165-mile race. (https://velo.outsideonline.com/events/lauren-de-crescenzo-john-keller-win-the-rad-165mi-gravel-race/)

**Lailah [COMPETITIVE]:** "Going into The Rad, I didn't know what to expect. I was heavily underprepared for the event, but gave it all I had regardless. Unfortunately, I had to be pulled from the race because I missed the second cutoff by just a few minutes. I was absolutely devastated, a blubbering mess on the bike, but I kept going. I wanted to see if I could go the distance... I ended up riding for another 32 miles before I bonked so hard I could barely steady myself... I rode the longest distance I ever had by almost 30 miles." (https://www.distancetoempty.com/news/2022/11/03/the-rad-dirt-fest-wrap)

**Kate [COMPETITIVE]:** "Just after SBT GRVL in August I had come down with Covid and spend most of the next 7 weeks recovering, not spending much time on the bike. I was unsure of my conditioning going into the Rad but knew that if I rode my ride I'd do fine. While I had definitely lost a step due to my illness and recovery, I was proud of my ride. Finishing my race faster than I had hoped, though the only PRs I set were in my own internal goals of climbing with confidence." (https://www.distancetoempty.com/news/2022/11/03/the-rad-dirt-fest-wrap)

**Hannah [COMPETITIVE]:** "Even though the weather was looking questionable, I was able to finish my first 100 mile ride and beat the rain. Trinidad gravel lived up to all the hype and my legs felt strong throughout the ride. Seeing familiar faces throughout the day at aid stations, on the road, and at the finish line was also such a cool feeling." (https://www.distancetoempty.com/news/2022/11/03/the-rad-dirt-fest-wrap)

**Aaron Bible [UNKNOWN]:** "As the day went on the wind picked up and made for a challenging end of the race, not to mention some gnarly climbs through town to finish downtown at the expo, but we persevered with mostly smiles and high fives."

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Thömus Sliker X [UNKNOWN level rider]:** Full carbon frame with "all-in-one" design featuring road gearing and fairly slack geometry. Reviewer noted: "it feels so stable, responsive, and trustworthy... gives it a simultaneous barely-there and bombproof feel as it glides over any kind of bump." The slack geometry "instills confidence on long courses where the terrain and surface is bound to be dynamic." (https://www.elevationoutdoors.com/go-outside/why-the-rad-dirt-fest-is-rad-and-the-gear-that-helped-get-the-job-done/)

**Pearl Izumi Expedition Shoe [UNKNOWN level rider]:** Features BOA Fit System with L6E reel for quick-fit adjustments through midfoot, with Velcro strap for independent forefoot adjustment. Includes integrated EVA insert at heel for vibration damping on rough roads. Suitable for aggressive gravel and XC MTB. (https://www.elevationoutdoors.com/go-outside/why-the-rad-dirt-fest-is-rad-and-the-gear-that-helped-get-the-job-done/)

**Swiftwick ASPIRE Seven socks [UNKNOWN level rider]:** "Thin compression crew sock that won't bulk up in your shoe but offers enough protection to keep the feet feeling powerful. The lightly compressive design of these socks supports the arches to stave off fatigue and give you more control over each pedal stroke." (https://www.elevationoutdoors.com/go-outside/why-the-rad-dirt-fest-is-rad-and-the-gear-that-helped-get-the-job-done/)

**Sweet Protection Falconer Aero 2Vi helmet [UNKNOWN level rider]:** Uses MIPS to reduce risk of injury from rotational forces while prioritizing aerodynamics. Features magnetic ventilation covers for airflow control across conditions. Includes eyewear grippers for integrated setup. (https://www.elevationoutdoors.com/go-outside/why-the-rad-dirt-fest-is-rad-and-the-gear-that-helped-get-the-job-done/)

**Velocio signature bib shorts and jersey [UNKNOWN level rider]:** Features "sleek profile that you don't have to worry about catching on your seat or getting in the way. Light compression makes a surprising difference with muscle recovery throughout the ride. The 5-panel design makes that compression possible without restricting movement. Seamless straps sit without digging in or chafing." Jersey has same light compression to help prevent grip fatigue along arms.

## Weather Experienced

**2023 Race:** Weather was "looking questionable" but riders were "able to finish my first 100 mile ride and beat the rain." [COMPETITIVE rider] Wind "picked up and made for a challenging end of the race." [UNKNOWN level rider] (https://www.distancetoempty.com/news/2022/11/03/the-rad-dirt-fest-wrap, https://www.elevationoutdoors.com/go-outside/why-the-rad-dirt-fest-is-rad-and-the-gear-that-helped-get-the-job-done/)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Course Profile (2023):** Three distance options were offered:
- 112-mile Stubborn Delores: 10,400+ feet of elevation gain
- 68-mile Anteloop: 6,500 feet of climbing  
- 47-mile Frijole: 4,200 feet of climbing

All three courses were new for 2023 and featured "a mix of pristine and punchy gravel in what was essentially a lollipop out and back." (https://www.elevationoutdoors.com/go-outside/why-the-rad-dirt-fest-is-rad-and-the-gear-that-helped-get-the-job-done/)

**2021 Course (165 miles):** Course started with a lap around Trinidad Lake State Park. After 55 miles of gradual climbing, the course began to descend. Final sections included "a pretty brutal climb on blacktop" followed by "a sporty descent in the last quarter mile." There were "gnarly climbs through town to finish downtown at the expo." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/events/lauren-de-crescenzo-john-keller-win-the-rad-165mi-gravel-race/, https://www.elevationoutdoors.com/go-outside/why-the-rad-dirt-fest-is-rad-and-the-gear-that-helped-get-the-job-done/)

**Course Changes:** The courses "changed significantly from last year to this year" between 2022 and 2023. (https://www.elevationoutdoors.com/go-outside/why-the-rad-dirt-fest-is-rad-and-the-gear-that-helped-get-the-job-done/)

**Gravel Quality:** One rider described it as "Trinidad gravel lived up to all the hype." [COMPETITIVE] (https://www.distancetoempty.com/news/2022/11/03/the-rad-race-wrap)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**[ELITE] Strategy - John Keller:** "I went hard on the first dirt climb and went over the top alone" at just 10 miles into the 165-mile course. "I just held what I knew I could do all day based on heart rate." He maintained a gap that was "over 10 minutes at one point" and rode 155 miles off the front alone. (https://velo.outsideonline.com/events/lauren-de-crescenzo-john-keller-win-the-rad-165mi-gravel-race/)

**[ELITE] Strategy - Lauren De Crescenzo:** Intentionally rode for overall placement, not just women's win. Spent approximately 100 miles of the 165-mile race riding alone. At one point was only 50 seconds back from the men's leader. (https://velo.outsideonline.com/events/lauren-de-crescenzo-john-keller-win-the-rad-165mi-gravel-race/)

**[COMPETITIVE] Strategy - Kate:** "I was unsure of my conditioning going into the Rad but knew that if I rode my ride I'd do fine." Emphasized riding her own race and focused on "climbing with confidence" as her internal goal. (https://www.distancetoempty.com/news/2022/11/03/the-rad-dirt-fest-wrap)

**Cutoff Timing [COMPETITIVE rider experience]:** One rider "missed the second cutoff by just a few minutes" and was pulled from the race, indicating strict time cutoffs are enforced. (https://www.distancetoempty.com/news/2022/11/03/the-rad-dirt-fest-wrap)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Time Cutoffs:** Strict cutoffs are enforced at multiple points. One [COMPETITIVE] rider was pulled after missing "the second cutoff by just a few minutes" despite continuing on and riding an additional 32 miles before bonking. (https://www.distancetoempty.com/news/2022/11/03/the-rad-dirt-fest-wrap)

**Bonking [COMPETITIVE rider]:** After missing cutoff and riding an additional 32 miles, one rider "bonked so hard I could barely steady myself." This occurred after already riding their longest distance ever by almost 30 miles. (https://www.distancetoempty.com/news/2022/11/03/the-rad-dirt-fest-wrap)

**Finish Line Hazard [ELITE rider]:** Lauren De Crescenzo crashed and broke her collarbone at the finish line in 2021 after "getting tangled in the running-event-style finishing tape." The finish line snafu cost her an extra minute and prevented what would have been second overall by one minute instead of two. (https://velo.outsideonline.com/events/lauren-de-crescenzo-john-keller-win-the-rad-165mi-gravel-race/)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Host Town Transformation:** "Downtown Trinidad was completely revitalized from the last time I had been through here many years ago... Usually these little towns go downhill, not up, and it was a welcomed surprise. It seemed as if all of the dispensaries had brought in a bit of money and life back to the area, and there were way more breweries and other renovated store fronts throughout the quaint, historic downtown." (https://www.elevationoutdoors.com/go-outside/why-the-rad-dirt-fest-is-rad-and-the-gear-that-helped-get-the-job-done/)

**Event Scale (2023):** "The town was overflowing with enthusiasm from more than a thousand of seemingly every type of rider, pros and amateurs alike from 46 states and nine countries." (https://www.elevationoutdoors.com/go-outside/why-the-rad-dirt-fest-is-rad-and-the-gear-that-helped-get-the-job-done/)

**Community Support [COMPETITIVE rider]:** "Seeing familiar faces throughout the day at aid stations, on the road, and at the finish line was also such a cool feeling." (https://www.distancetoempty.com/news/2022/11/03/the-rad-dirt-fest-wrap)

**Local Restaurant Tradition:** Rino's Italian restaurant remained unchanged from years prior, "where you'll eat authentic Italian food and be serenaded and swooned with Elvis and Neil Diamond classics by the staff during your meal. It's really something else." (https://www.elevationoutdoors.com/go-outside/why-the-rad-dirt-fest-is-rad-and-the-gear-that-helped-get-the-job-done/)
