# THE RANGE — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

No rider race reports, blog posts, or forum discussions were found specifically about The Range gravel event. YouTube coverage exists from the 2021 edition ("The Range Race and Event - 2021 by The Gravel Experience") describing the event as an epic gravel adventure in southwest Alberta, but no detailed written race reports from participants have been identified.

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

The Range features **2 natural creek crossings on a private road through Burton's Burke Creek Ranch (est. 1890)**. The course runs through varied ecosystems including:
- Open grasslands
- Dense forest of the Porcupine Hills
- Sweeping views of the Rocky Mountains
- 2-track ranch roads
- **Skyline Road (described as "one of the best kept secrets in Alberta")**
- Single truss bridges
- Historic ranches as the only markers in wilderness areas

The course includes **over 50 directional signs** and features a mix of public and private land sections. Private roads are **only accessible during the event**, providing a unique riding experience that cannot be replicated outside of race day.

**Distance Options:** Four routes available for all abilities: The Range (approximately 160km/100 miles with 8000 feet of elevation gain), 4iiii Frontier, Rustler (86km), and Rodeo (60km). The longest route delivers a true endurance challenge through the hills of southwest Alberta. (therangerace.com)

**DNF Rates (2025):** The terrain takes its toll — the 2025 edition saw approximately 20-25% DNF rate for the Rodeo (59km) and 25-29% DNF rate for the Rustler (86km), suggesting the course is more demanding than its distance alone would indicate. (therangerace.com)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**E-bikes:** Not permitted for The Range, Frontier, or similar competitive distances. (therangerace.com)

No participant-specific tire or gear recommendations are available from race reports. The varied terrain including gravel roads, 2-track ranch roads, grass sections, and creek crossings suggests a robust gravel setup with tires in the 40-45mm range for adequate comfort and traction across the mixed surfaces.

## Weather Experienced

No specific race-day weather reports are available from past editions. The event takes place in mid-July in Claresholm, Alberta, in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. Summer conditions in this region can vary significantly, with warm daytime temperatures but potential for afternoon thunderstorms typical of the Alberta foothills.

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Chip-Timed with Sector Challenge:** The event is chip-timed with overall rankings and includes a **Sector Challenge** option — a demanding 3km sprint sector near the finish for riders who want to race specific segments while still enjoying the full ride experience. This format allows riders to choose their level of competitiveness. (granfondoguide.com)

No pacing data or power numbers are available from participants. The significant elevation gain (8000 feet for The Range) over rolling ranch roads and forest terrain suggests pacing on the climbs is critical, particularly given the 25-29% DNF rates observed at shorter distances.
