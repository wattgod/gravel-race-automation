# THE RIFT — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Anne Moore [ELITE]:** "I can't say enough about how cool these places were. Chris and I stayed at Midgard as it is a family-run adventure excursion hostel/hotel. The place is AMAZING and the owners/staff are the some of the nicest, most accommodating people you could ever meet." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2019-the-rift-hvolsvollur-iceland-by-anne-moore/)

**Anne Moore [ELITE]:** "Sure enough, Phase 1 was ALL. THE. CLIMBING. As you know, elevation recording can vary from device to device. The GPX file we were given to follow recorded 4,900 feet of climbing... At the end of the day my Garmin read 6,100 ft. Whichever it was I do not know, but it felt a hell of a lot closer to 6,100 than 4,900. Seriously, 90% of this climbing was in the first 50 miles." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2019-the-rift-hvolsvollur-iceland-by-anne-moore/)

**Anne Moore [ELITE]:** "As we turned onto the gravel the climbs started. The first climb consisted of nice, smooth gravel and it was long and windy (not switch-backy though) and enough of an effort to splinter the group... By the time I reached the top I found myself with a small group of about eight men, including Chris." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2019-the-rift-hvolsvollur-iceland-by-anne-moore/)

**Anne Moore [ELITE]:** "At the top of the climb, the gravel turned not-so-nice on us. It was now big, loose chunky rocks and you had to move from one side of the road to the next for the best line, which makes it a bit more challenging for bigger groups to stay together." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2019-the-rift-hvolsvollur-iceland-by-anne-moore/)

**Anne Moore [ELITE]:** "The climbs got longer and steeper and the weather turned FAST. As we reached the higher elevations the wind picked up to at least 25 – 30 mph. At first, it was coming at us as crosswinds combined with torrential rain that was pelting us sideways. With even stronger gusts I was having a difficult time staying upright, and I was being blown into bad lines of thicker, chunkier gravel." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2019-the-rift-hvolsvollur-iceland-by-anne-moore/)

**Anne Moore [ELITE]:** "I was pushing hard and my heart rate was pegged way higher than I wanted it to be, but I was barely pushing eight mph on the flats and that was pissing me off." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2019-the-rift-hvolsvollur-iceland-by-anne-moore/)

**Jim Cuene [ELITE]:** "Miles 60-80 were, basically, washboard gravel roads. You could ride on the sides and skip the middle lines, but it was really sandy off the main part of the road. Just a terrible stretch. The worst part of the day was a 1 mile stretch at mile 78 that felt like we were riding over a lava rock field with no clear line. You had to slow down or risk a crash or, just very unnecessary!" (https://cuene.com/the-rift-2024/)

**Jim Cuene [ELITE]:** "127 miles, 11.5 hours of total time, 10:30 of riding. Tough surface (horrible at times), 20 miles of washboard gravel. The most beautiful course you could ask for, including an active volcano. Harder than Leadville." (https://cuene.com/the-rift-2024/)

**Jim Cuene [ELITE]:** "Most of the non-pavement was very rough surface, with large chunky rocks and potholes. You had to really pay attention to the line and tire placement the whole way. There were some sandy spots, too, but those weren't a major issues. The real killer: The washboards! I'd guess there's like 20 miles of sketchy, legitimate corrugated road surface that just sucks all the momentum out of your ride and tries to steal your soul along with it." (https://cuene.com/the-rift-2024/)

**Jim Cuene [ELITE]:** "They made a big deal of the river crossings, but there weren't, really, an issue. More of a novelty and a break in the action." (https://cuene.com/the-rift-2024/)

**Joe Perry [UNKNOWN]:** "From experience I knew I wanted a 2x set up to allow for wider gear range and flexibility during longer events." (https://www.rodeo-labs.com/ride-report-the-rift-iceland/)

**Joe Perry [UNKNOWN]:** "The day before the event we did some pre riding in the area, the gravel was large stone and the wind would build as the day went on but the excitement was growing as it was clear this was a special place and we hadn't even gotten into the highlands yet." (https://www.rodeo-labs.com/ride-report-the-rift-iceland/)

**Joe Perry [UNKNOWN]:** "After about 20km the weather really picked up. The wind was a consistent 30-40 mph with rain and hail and temperatures dropping to the low to mid 40°s as we climbed further into the interior." (https://www.rodeo-labs.com/ride-report-the-rift-iceland/)

**Joe Perry [UNKNOWN]:** "After leaving the second aid station the course had a few changes, the wind was now at our back, we were heading down, and the temperature was climbing quickly and reached near 70°F. It seemed like this was going to be a big payoff for the climbing and head wind earlier. Unfortunately, this section of the race was about 20 miles of straight washboard gravel." (https://www.rodeo-labs.com/ride-report-the-rift-iceland/)

**Casey Cohenmeyer [ELITE]:** "I will have nightmares about the next 15 miles. The highest point of the ride was at mile 43, we foolishly thought that we would now be rewarded with some downhill. No. From mile 60 to 75 we rode nothing but the most miserable, sharp, awful washboards with the rain and wind picking up. Just frame shattering horror." (https://bicycle.spinergy.com/blogs/news/the-rift-2021-race-report-i-mean-survival-report)

**Casey Cohenmeyer [ELITE]:** "Every time you thought you saw a better line it would disappear. The 'gutters' were ten inch deep sand with fixed, sharp lava rock to punish you if you made the slightest error. The demon washboards had to be ridden. There was no way around it." (https://bicycle.spinergy.com/blogs/news/the-rift-2021-race-report-i-mean-survival-report)

**Casey Cohenmeyer [ELITE]:** "Halfway through this sector I saw a sign that said 'Stop crying like a child' and I did wonder if crying might make it better. Definitely the most miserable 90 min I've ever experienced on a bicycle." (https://bicycle.spinergy.com/blogs/news/the-rift-2021-race-report-i-mean-survival-report)

**Casey Cohenmeyer [ELITE]:** "My body was shattered after the washboards and my mind needed a break. It was not going to get one. I remembered from other's 2019 Strava that this was a sector that they averaged 20-22mph. Yes!!! and we turned left into a 20mph headwind. NO!!!!" (https://bicycle.spinergy.com/blogs/news/the-rift-2021-race-report-i-mean-survival-report)

**Christoph Döttelmayer [ELITE]:** "Never have I been that destroyed after a race. Never have I looked so much forward to dying next to my wife... That constant shaking started to suck out the energy from my body and there was nothing I could do besides feeding the right way like I always do in races but even drinking was becomimg harder and harder as it was almost impossible to ride with one hand." (https://gravgrav.cc/en/article/the-rift-2023)

**Christoph Döttelmayer [ELITE]:** "I crossed the finish line after 08:48h with a 27th spot from 420 riders. What a feeling. Personal goal achieved. Totally f…..Never have I been that destroyed after a race." (https://gravgrav.cc/en/article/the-rift-2023)

**Sarah Swallow [ELITE]:** "Within the first 10-miles of the race, everything in my body protested the speed and exertion I was attempting to maintain. As it turns out, riding between 100 and 150 miles a day for 21 days is not ideal training for the high intensity of a single-day gravel race, or at least the start of one." (https://sarahjswallow.com/stories/2021/8/3/volcanoes-waterfalls-and-puffins-my-travel-journal-from-iceland-and-the-rift-gravel-race)

**Sarah Swallow [ELITE]:** "After spending another 10-miles or so getting passed by what felt like the entire field, I swallowed some humble pie and shifted my focus to settling in and just riding the ride as if it was just another day on the Tour Divide." (https://sarahjswallow.com/stories/2021/8/3/volcanoes-waterfalls-and-puffins-my-travel-journal-from-iceland-and-the-rift-gravel-race)

**Connor [UNKNOWN]:** "I crossed the line in 19th place, clocking 6 hours and 50 minutes over one of the most punishing and rewarding courses I've ever raced." (https://coefficientcycling.com/blogs/news/200km-of-lava-fields-fog-and-roads-carved-from-volcanic-rock-my-rift-iceland-experience-with-coefficient-cycling)

**Connor [UNKNOWN]:** "A chase group of 25 elite riders caught us only 60 km in, and the race completely reshuffled. What followed was an absolute war zone of steep climbs, rocky descents, and endless hike-a-bike sections. The field exploded, with everyone riding solo in time-trial mode, just trying to keep moving." (https://coefficientcycling.com/blogs/news/200km-of-lava-fields-fog-and-roads-carved-from-volcanic-rock-my-rift-iceland-experience-with-coefficient-cycling)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Anne Moore [ELITE] - Bike Setup:** "I decided to ride my Breadwinner B-Road with Schwalbe G One 40mm tires, carry 3 bottles and not wear a hydration pack." She later noted: "In hindsight I felt like I was dressed perfectly" but added "Should have gone with lower pressure by letting some air out early. the 30 PSI was a little stiff." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2019-the-rift-hvolsvollur-iceland-by-anne-moore/)

**Anne Moore [ELITE] - Clothing:** "Being from coastal South Carolina I went with knickers suited for 40-60 degrees, a short sleeve baselayer and jersey, wool socks and a rain jacket. Even though it wasn't raining at the start I decided to wear the jacket anyway for an added layer of warmth. I am so glad I did because when the rain (and sleet, and some say snow) it came hard and fast and I would not have wanted to stop to put it on." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2019-the-rift-hvolsvollur-iceland-by-anne-moore/)

**Jim Cuene [ELITE] - Bike Setup:** "I rode my new Specialized Crux. Made a few modifications: Added some Carbon bars, added a Redshift 'shock' stem and some thicker tape on the bars. SRAM Rival drivetrain with 40T up front, and a 10-44 on the rear. Stock Roval rims, with Rene Herse 48 MM tires at 30PSI." (https://cuene.com/the-rift-2024/)

**Jim Cuene [ELITE] - Bike Setup Reflections:** "Might have preferred a 38 up front. Might also consider a 'mullet' setup with an 11-54 or something. Wouldn't be against a 2x system, either. Could have used a bit more gear variety... Should have gone with lower pressure by letting some air out early. the 30 PSI was a little stiff." (https://cuene.com/the-rift-2024/)

**Jim Cuene [ELITE] - Clothing:** "I went with Rapha Core Cargo Bibs and they were perfect. No issues with the chamois, the pockets or anything. I had a normal base layer, and went with the Velocio Prime long sleeve jersey. Wool socks, normal Lake gravel shoes. Also used Rapha cycling gloves (not long fingered). Used Smith glasses with the 'clear' polarized lenses (vs the tinted). Rode with a Camelback chase vest that had a 70 oz bladder jammed in (vs. the normal 50 oz). Had a Voler wind jacket in the camelback in case it cooled down, but I never needed it. I was concerned about getting the layers right, but the clothes were totally dialed in. Never thought about the gear at all." (https://cuene.com/the-rift-2024/)

**Jim Cuene [ELITE] - What Didn't Work:** "I also rode with a Revelate frame bag to carry gels, drink mix and a couple CO2 cartridges. Wouldn't recommend it. Dropped it at the last feed station because I was hitting it with my legs." (https://cuene.com/the-rift-2024/)

**Joe Perry [UNKNOWN] - Bike Setup:** "I went with a 650b wheel size using Schwalbe's 2.1 Thunderburt tire. I like that it is a lightweight and fast rolling tire so you don't compromise too much for its larger width." (https://www.rodeo-labs.com/ride-report-the-rift-iceland/)

**Joe Perry [UNKNOWN] - Drivetrain:** "Since Shimano had just come out with a clutch rear derailleur that worked with 2x the Ultegra 2×11 di2 set up was an easy choice." (https://www.rodeo-labs.com/ride-report-the-rift-iceland/)

**Casey Cohenmeyer [ELITE] - Clothing Decision:** "The dilemma was whether or not to wear leg warmers. The temperatures were undoubtedly cold enough for leg warmers. Still, my experience in similar wet conditions on the Tour Divide was that wet leg warmers on my knees are a bother... At the last minute, I took the leg warmers off and toed the line... my clothing choice panned out— wearing what I had worn during my Tour Divide ride: shorts, a merino t-shirt, and a rain jacket. I was perfectly content with what I was wearing and did not have to stop to delayer or layer up once." (https://bicycle.spinergy.com/blogs/news/the-rift-2021-race-report-i-mean-survival-report)

**Christoph Döttelmayer [ELITE] - Clothing:** "Riding short/short with a vest and arm warmers was all that was needed." On race day: "I packed everything from deep winter gear to just jersey and bibs. July is the best stable summer month but come race day we still had 12C but no rain. That was all everyone could wish for." (https://gravgrav.cc/en/article/the-rift-2023)

**Sarah Swallow [ELITE] - Tire Choice & Pressure:** Rode Schwalbe G One 40mm tires at 30 PSI. In hindsight noted: "Should have gone with lower pressure by letting some air out early. the 30 PSI was a little stiff. Thought I'd naturally lose some air over the day, but i don't think i did." (https://sarahjswallow.com/stories/2021/8/3/volcanoes-waterfalls-and-puffins-my-travel-journal-from-iceland-and-the-rift-gravel-race)

**Connor [UNKNOWN] - Handlebars:** "My Coefficient 38cm handlebars gave me the edge when it came to positioning, handling through rough terrain, and staying comfortable during hours of solo effort. The narrow width helped me stay aero on the flats and in the wind, especially for the final 22 km time trial to the line. They also felt stable in the flared-out drops during rocky descents." (https://coefficientcycling.com/blogs/news/200km-of-lava-fields-fog-and-roads-carved-from-volcanic-rock-my-rift-iceland-experience-with-coefficient-cycling)

## Weather Experienced

**2019 Race (Anne Moore):** "The forecast on my Weather Underground app was for 60 American degrees and occasional rain with a tiny bit of wind (I believe WU said 7 mph but, next spoiler: it lied)... As we reached the higher elevations the wind picked up to at least 25 – 30 mph. At first, it was coming at us as crosswinds combined with torrential rain that was pelting us sideways... At times the precipitation turned to sleet, and some riders post-race war stories included snow." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2019-the-rift-hvolsvollur-iceland-by-anne-moore/)

**2019 Race (Joe Perry):** "The wind was a consistent 30-40 mph with rain and hail and temperatures dropping to the low to mid 40°s as we climbed further into the interior... After leaving the second aid station... the temperature was climbing quickly and reached near 70°F." (https://www.rodeo-labs.com/ride-report-the-rift-iceland/)

**2021 Race (Casey Cohenmeyer):** "Race day was a whole other story – It was raining hard, windy and chilly. I don't thing the temperature ever got much above 50º... It was chilly and it never warmed up... The next 70K was bone shattering rumble strips into a headwind with little relief from the rain." (https://bicycle.spinergy.com/blogs/news/the-rift-2021-race-report-i-mean-survival-report)

**2023 Race (Christoph Döttelmayer):** "July is the best stable summer month but come race day we still had 12C but no rain. That was all everyone could wish for." (https://gravgrav.cc/en/article/the-rift-2023)

**2024 Race (Jim Cuene):** "We hit the jackpot. The day started out great: Bluebird skies, no wind and about 55 degrees. We knew it was going to change over the long ride, with lots of wind likely and, of course, some rain. Overall, the skies were mostly clear with some clouds cover. It probably got up to 60 degrees at the warmest, but with the sun it felt hotter. We got lucky on the wind; it never really picked up that much. The rain held off until the last 5 miles and it was fine. In hindsight, we probably got an outlier day. Very low likelihood it will be that nice most days out there." (https://cuene.com/the-rift-2024/)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Anne Moore [ELITE] - River Crossings:** "The first river crossing... was actually two crossings of the same river as you meandered your way through it... Several river crossings came in quick succession and that split the groups again." At mile 60: "there was this option to change shoes/clothes. I didn't need to change my clothes (wool is your friend) but I did decide to change my shoes and socks. It felt divine." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2019-the-rift-hvolsvollur-iceland-by-anne-moore/)

**Anne Moore [ELITE] - The Worst Section:** "From mile 60 to 75 we rode nothing but the most miserable, sharp, awful washboards with the rain and wind picking up. Just frame shattering horror. Every time you thought you saw a better line it would disappear. The 'gutters' were ten inch deep sand with fixed, sharp lava rock to punish you if you made the slightest error." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2019-the-rift-hvolsvollur-iceland-by-anne-moore/)

**Anne Moore [ELITE] - Course Breakdown:** "The first 40km of the course had much of the climbing... After leaving the second aid station the course had a few changes, the wind was now at our back, we were heading down, and the temperature was climbing quickly... this section of the race was about 20 miles of straight washboard gravel... Following this there was a fast pavement section... At this point the wind became a factor again as either cross wind or head wind and it was just a grind to the finish through large stone gravel roads." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2019-the-rift-hvolsvollur-iceland-by-anne-moore/)

**Jim Cuene [ELITE] - Course Breakdown:** "The first 40 miles was mostly a steady climb up and into the highlands, with Mt Hekla a constant presence. Some hills required pushing (or, I should say, where pushing was the right, most practical choice), but it was mostly climbable. The second 60 miles or so is gradual decline on sandy, gravely, rutted roads with sketchy downhills that will take you off course quickly if you aren't riding the brakes (saw a bunch of folks go down while descending). The final 20 miles or so are a rolling combo of pavement, rocky 'jeep' trail to a long, beautiful ascent, past a cool waterfall and then a fast descent to 5 miles of pavement until the finish." (https://cuene.com/the-rift-2024/)

**Jim Cuene [ELITE] - Washboards:** "I'd guess there's like 20 miles of sketchy, legitimate corrugated road surface that just sucks all the momentum out of your ride and tries to steal your soul along with it." (https://cuene.com/the-rift-2024/)

**Jim Cuene [ELITE] - Specific Trouble Spot:** "The worst part of the day was a 1 mile stretch at mile 78 that felt like we were riding over a lava rock field with no clear line. You had to slow down or risk a crash or, just very unnecessary!" (https://cuene.com/the-rift-2024/)

**Joe Perry [UNKNOWN] - River Crossings:** "There were 5 major river crosses on the event and the bike handled great through those." (https://www.rodeo-labs.com/ride-report-the-rift-iceland/)

**Joe Perry [UNKNOWN] - Washboard Section:** "Unfortunately, this section of the race was about 20 miles of straight washboard gravel. There was no good line and it was very rough on the bike and the body. In order to avoid the washboard you had to ride the edge which was very loose." (https://www.rodeo-labs.com/ride-report-the-rift-iceland/)

**Christoph Döttelmayer [ELITE] - Road Surfaces:** "After 127km you finally hit the pavement again and things started to be familiar with my road riding. This was a big relief for the body to shake out and relax a bit at least until the hard side cross wind made our group of 5 riding across two lanes just to get tome slipstream from one another." (https://gravgrav.cc/en/article/the-rift-2023)

**Sarah Swallow [ELITE] - Course Character:** "Black roads of lava rocks and sand rolled steeply over hills and through deep rivers of glacial melt. Occasionally the fog would clear to reveal the surrounding cone-shaped mountains highlighted in neon moss." (https://sarahjswallow.com/stories/2021/8/3/volcanoes-waterfalls-and-puffins-my-travel-journal-from-iceland-and-the-rift-gravel-race)

**Sarah Swallow [ELITE] - Technical Nature:** "The Rift course was probably the most cyclocross style gravel course I had ever ridden-- steep hike-a-bike hills, technical off-camber, rutted descents, sandpits, and river crossings." (https://sarahjswallow.com/stories/2021/8/3/volcanoes-waterfalls-and-puffins-my-travel-journal-from-iceland-and-the-rift-gravel-race)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Anne Moore [ELITE] - Pacing Strategy:** "My initial feeling was that this was going to be an experience and not a 'race' and I was just going to go and have fun. Gradually that morphed into I'm going to race this thing and see what I can do... I kept telling myself to chill out and not burn any matches this soon but here I was with the lead group and I wanted to ride the wave for as long as I could." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2019-the-rift-hvolsvollur-iceland-by-anne-moore/)

**Anne Moore [ELITE] - Climbing Strategy:** "One voice in my head was telling me to hold my rhythm and not pay attention to the riders around me. The other voice wanted me to pick off as many people as I could." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2019-the-rift-hvolsvollur-iceland-by-anne-moore/)

**Jim Cuene [ELITE] - Pre-Race Goals:** "My goals for this one were pretty modest: Finish the ride, Make it through safe and sound, Finish with a smile on my face, Target 11 hours, but finish it under 12." He finished in 11.5 hours total time, 10:30 riding. (https://cuene.com/the-rift-2024/)

**Jim Cuene [ELITE] - Pacing Strategy:** "My strategy was to ride pretty conservative for the first 40 miles, knowing it would be easy to overdo it with all the climbing. Definitely didn't want to crash out early, either. So, just sort of went my own pace at the start. Slowly but surely worked my way up in the pack, just going my own pace." (https://cuene.com/the-rift-2024/)

**Jim Cuene [ELITE] - Nutrition Plan:** "My plan was to get about 100 grams of carbs in each hour. I've trained with that amount all spring and I was really confident my GI wouldn't rebel. Every hour – 20 oz of drink mix (2-3 scoops of Tailwind), Every 45 minutes – 1 Gu gel, When I could – Waffles / Bars (aka 'real' food) from aid stations and from my frame bag. Maybe had 2 waffles over the course of the ride? Water – I'd power down as much water as I could handle at the aid stations, but most of the hydration was coming from the Tailwind." Result: "Never bonked, never cramped." (https://cuene.com/the-rift-2024/)

**Jim Cuene [ELITE] - What Worked/Didn't:** "What worked: Nutrition – I went through the equivalent of 10 bottles of Tailwind mix via bottles and the camelback. Went through 9 or 10 gu/SIS packets. No other food at the aid stations. No real food on the ride. Never bonked, never cramped. Pacing – Managed the pace well for what I was trying to do. Could have probably gone harder for the middle couple hours, and maybe at the end. But, I'm satisfied with our times... What Didn't work: Aid Station futzing – I spent too much time dicking around in the aid stations: getting water bottles filled, looking for food, talking to people. Could have gotten 30 minutes of time just by being more focused at the stopping points." (https://cuene.com/the-rift-2024/)

**Sarah Swallow [ELITE] - Training Reality Check:** "Within the first 10-miles of the race, everything in my body protested the speed and exertion I was attempting to maintain. As it turns out, riding between 100 and 150 miles a day for 21 days is not ideal training for the high intensity of a single-day gravel race, or at least the start of one. I felt no benefit from the four interval rides I managed to squeeze in during the two weeks between the Tour Divide and The Rift." (https://sarahjswallow.com/stories/2021/8/3/volcanoes-waterfalls-and-puffins-my-travel-journal-from-iceland-and-the-rift-gravel-race)

**Sarah Swallow [ELITE] - Recovery Strategy:** "After spending another 10-miles or so getting passed by what felt like the entire field, I swallowed some humble pie and shifted my focus to settling in and just riding the ride as if it was just another day on the Tour Divide. For the first time, I took in my surroundings." (https://sarahjswallow.com/stories/2021/8/3/volcanoes-waterfalls-and-puffins-my-travel-journal-from-iceland-and-the-rift-gravel-race)

**Connor [UNKNOWN] - Race Dynamics:** "At 8 a.m. the flag dropped, and I went for it immediately, attacking out of the neutral zone. An Icelandic rider followed me on a dual-suspension mountain bike, while I stuck to my gravel setup... For the first 50 km, it felt like we had the race under control, but then the hammer dropped from behind. A chase group of 25 elite riders caught us only 60 km in, and the race completely reshuffled." (https://coefficientcycling.com/blogs/news/200km-of-lava-fields-fog-and-roads-carved-from-volcanic-rock-my-rift-iceland-experience-with-coefficient-cycling)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Anne Moore [ELITE] - Flat Tires Common:** "The terrain was very rocky and I was concerned about tire punctures" (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2019-the-rift-hvolsvollur-iceland-by-anne-moore/)

**Anne Moore [ELITE] - River Crossing Falls:** "This sector was a melee of riders changing flat tires... I watched the riders in front of me picking their lines... Several river crossings came in quick succession and that split the groups again." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2019-the-rift-hvolsvollur-iceland-by-anne-moore/)

**Jim Cuene [ELITE] - Mental Challenges:** "The ride from 107 to 122 was over a combo of roads, gravel, and jeep track. We worked our way up to the top of the first/last hill, and we hammered it down despite all the fatigue. The ride from 107 to 122 was over a combo of roads, gravel, and jeep track... Overall, i felt decent at the end of the ride, So, the endurance was there. What Didn't work:... Focus – Mentally, i was really good until about mile 107. I was getting mentally foggy at that point, and losing the motivation. Needed a pep talk from Jim Brick to get it going again." (https://cuene.com/the-rift-2024/)

**Jim Cuene [ELITE] - Crashes on Descents:** "The second 60 miles or so is gradual decline on sandy, gravely, rutted roads with sketchy downhills that will take you off course quickly if you aren't riding the brakes (saw a bunch of folks go down while descending)." (https://cuene.com/the-rift-2024/)

**Casey Cohenmeyer [ELITE] - River Falls:** Friend Echo "went in the drink, all but her
