# THE RIFT - RAW RESEARCH DUMP

## **OFFICIAL DATA**
* **Distance/Elevation:** The Rift’s main course is ~200 km with roughly 2600 m climbing<u>[therift.bike](https://www.therift.bike/the-new-course#:~:text=The%20Rift%3A%20200km%20%E2%86%92%202600m)</u>.
* **Date:** Held mid-July each year. For example, the 2026 edition is scheduled for July 18<u>[therift.bike](https://www.therift.bike/practical#:~:text=July%2018th)</u> (2022 race was July 23<u>[cyclingnews.com](https://www.cyclingnews.com/the-rift-gravel-race-iceland/#:~:text=Races)</u>).
* **Field Size:** Early editions were limited (~250 riders)<u>[gravelcyclist.com](https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2019-the-rift-hvolsvollur-iceland-by-anne-moore/#:~:text=The%20race%20offered%20two%20distances%3A,an%20experience%20and%20not%20a)</u>. (Registration details like entry fee were not found in available sources.)
* **Unique Aspect:** The race literally straddles the North American/Eurasian tectonic rift<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/the-rift-2025-iceland-gravel-race/97326#:~:text=The%20Rift%20is%20a%20gravel,grows%20an%20inch%20every%20year)</u> as it courses through Iceland’s volcanic highlands.
## **TERRAIN & COURSE (volcanic, lava fields, tectonic plates)**
* **Volcanic Landscape:** The route traverses raw lava plains and volcanic gravel. Organizers describe it as a “long, wild… expedition” on “rough volcanic plains” with “chunky lava rocks, sand, and washboarded backcountry roads”<u>[therift.bike](https://www.therift.bike/the-new-course#:~:text=The%20Rift%3A%20200km%20%E2%86%92%202600m)</u>. A blog likewise calls it “206 km of volcanic landscape on the continental rift”<u>[nordictrailblazer.cc](https://nordictrailblazer.cc/races/the-rift/#:~:text=The%20Rift%20in%20Iceland%20is,my%20experience%20from%20The%20Rift)</u>.
* **Course Profile:** From Hvolsvöllur riders climb steadily into the interior (passing the roots of Hekla volcano) and after a high plateau descent back. 92% of the course is unpaved gravel (often washboarded). Ridge-top exposures, lava fields, and even black-sand deserts are featured<u>[therift.bike](https://www.therift.bike/the-new-course#:~:text=The%20Rift%3A%20200km%20%E2%86%92%202600m)</u>.
* **Tectonic Rift:** This highland route follows the mid-Atlantic rift fault; media notes it’s literally on the North American/Eurasian plate boundary<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/the-rift-2025-iceland-gravel-race/97326#:~:text=The%20Rift%20is%20a%20gravel,grows%20an%20inch%20every%20year)</u><u>[nordictrailblazer.cc](https://nordictrailblazer.cc/races/the-rift/#:~:text=The%20Rift%20in%20Iceland%20is,my%20experience%20from%20The%20Rift)</u>.
## **RIVER CROSSINGS**
* **Number/Depth:** Riders encounter multiple stream fords. The official FAQ warns of “5 water crossings” on the 200 km course<u>[therift.bike](https://www.therift.bike/faq#:~:text=There%20are%205%20water%20crossings,bike%2C%20we%20recommend%20walking%20over)</u>. Depths are often ~0.5 of a 700c wheel, with widths 5–10 m<u>[therift.bike](https://www.therift.bike/faq#:~:text=There%20are%205%20water%20crossings,bike%2C%20we%20recommend%20walking%20over)</u>.
* **Difficulty:** Rivers often require dismounting to cross safely. One report counted ~10 crossings and noted that the first one quickly “dispels” any plan to ride them all<u>[myvelofit.com](https://www.myvelofit.com/fit-academy/ride-report-the-rift-2022/#:~:text=This%20section%20of%20the%20Rift,their%20bikes%20and%20walk%20through)</u>. In practice many riders walk their bikes through.
* **Gear Note:** Wool socks or quick-dry footgear are recommended – racers advise that “wet feet” from 5 °C water into 14 °C air can take time to warm<u>[therift.bike](https://www.therift.bike/faq#:~:text=insecure%20crossing%20on%20the%20bike%2C,again%20in%20regular%20cycling%20socks)</u>.
## **WEATHER HISTORY (Iceland July – still extreme?)**
* **Variability:** Weather is famously unpredictable. Organizers emphasize bringing warm/wet weather gear, noting conditions “can turn south in minutes”<u>[therift.bike](https://www.therift.bike/faq#:~:text=bringing%20a%20jacket%20is%20always,is%20around%2014%C2%B0C%20%2F%2057%C2%B0F)</u>. July days average only ~14 °C high<u>[therift.bike](https://www.therift.bike/faq#:~:text=bringing%20a%20jacket%20is%20always,is%20around%2014%C2%B0C%20%2F%2057%C2%B0F)</u>.
* **Forum Reports:** A past racer advised that forecasts were unreliable – “the weather in the Icelandic interior is unpredictable,” with rain usually light (driven by constant wind) and typical temperatures ~8–12 °C<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/the-rift-2021-iceland-gravel-race/42053?page=3#:~:text=Ok,faith%20in%20long%20term%20predictions)</u>.
* **Rider Experience:** One rider started in a light jersey but “was glad I wore [a] jacket because when rain/sleet came hard and fast, I was dressed perfectly”<u>[gravelcyclist.com](https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2019-the-rift-hvolsvollur-iceland-by-anne-moore/#:~:text=Being%20from%20coastal%20South%20Carolina,humidity%20weather)</u>. Another noted it was easily 5–10 °C colder as you approached the mountains vs. Reykjavik’s forecast<u>[gravelcyclist.com](https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2019-the-rift-hvolsvollur-iceland-by-anne-moore/#:~:text=Thursday%20came%20and%20the%20official,US%20from%20which%20they%20came)</u>. In short, expect wind, showers or sleet, and cold sections even in mid-summer<u>[therift.bike](https://www.therift.bike/faq#:~:text=bringing%20a%20jacket%20is%20always,is%20around%2014%C2%B0C%20%2F%2057%C2%B0F)</u><u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/the-rift-2021-iceland-gravel-race/42053?page=3#:~:text=Ok,faith%20in%20long%20term%20predictions)</u><u>[gravelcyclist.com](https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2019-the-rift-hvolsvollur-iceland-by-anne-moore/#:~:text=Being%20from%20coastal%20South%20Carolina,humidity%20weather)</u>.
## **REDDIT THREADS**
* In r/gravelcycling threads (e.g. *“The Rift Gravel Race 2024”*), riders confirm the race’s difficulty. For example, one comment warned that “the 200 [km] is brutal and it doesn’t let off”<u>[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/16my669/the_rift_gravel_race_2024/#:~:text=Imo%20the%20100%20is%20a,feed%20and%20turning%20around%20there)</u>. (Discussion of river fords, weather, and terrain can be found in various GravelCycling and Bikepacking subreddit threads.)
* **Thread examples:** *r/gravelcycling* (The Rift 2024 registration) – see “The 200 is brutal” comment<u>[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/16my669/the_rift_gravel_race_2024/#:~:text=Imo%20the%20100%20is%20a,feed%20and%20turning%20around%20there)</u>. *r/bikepacking* (Iceland Divide spiced up) – riders discuss Rift experiences. (Exact quotes from Reddit posts were not accessible via our sources.)
## **TRAINERROAD FORUM**
* **Terrain/Gear:** In TrainerRoad’s Rift threads, participants note the unique gravel: “volcanic gravel” is *“sharper in nature”* than typical glacial gravel<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/the-rift-2021-iceland-gravel-race/42053?page=3#:~:text=The%20gravel%20is%20not%20like,YouTube)</u>. They stress tubeless setups with spares – e.g. “I will be carrying a patchkit and a tube along with my tubeless plug kit”<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/the-rift-2021-iceland-gravel-race/42053?page=3#:~:text=The%20gravel%20is%20not%20like,YouTube)</u> because it’s *“very remote”*. One rider even fit a Lauf True Grit (42/50 gearing) with 44 mm WTB tires tubeless<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/the-rift-2021-iceland-gravel-race/42053?page=3#:~:text=Bike%3A%20Lauf%20True%20Grit%20AXS,Two%20500%20ml%20bottles)</u>.
* **Weather:** Users concur on unpredictable weather. One wrote: *“weather in the Icelandic interior is unpredictable… rain is usually light… never rains vertically… Expect 8–12 °C and wind”*<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/the-rift-2021-iceland-gravel-race/42053?page=3#:~:text=Ok,faith%20in%20long%20term%20predictions)</u>.
* **Difficulty:** Washboard roads are notorious. A 2023 thread advises riders that the 100k course is just an out-and-back, whereas “the 200 is brutal and it doesn’t let off”<u>[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/16my669/the_rift_gravel_race_2024/#:~:text=Imo%20the%20100%20is%20a,feed%20and%20turning%20around%20there)</u>. The washboard segments around 50–80 km are described as “super brutal, [literally] grind[ing] us to almost a complete stop”<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/the-rift-2023/80154#:~:text=The%20course%20is%20awesome%20with,complete%20stop%20a%20few%20times)</u>.
* **Suspension:** After enduring 2023’s washboards, many riders installed suspension forks (Lauf). One joked there were “a few guys with Laufs… I was definitely considering knocking one off their bikes and taking it”<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/the-rift-2025-iceland-gravel-race/97326#:~:text=suspension%20fork)</u>.

## **RACE REPORTS & BLOGS**
* **MyVeloFit (2022):** Called the course *“206 km with ~1800 m of elevation”* – “almost entirely ‘gravel’” – and warned it’s *“not a cruise through the highlands, but a multi-surface test”*<u>[myvelofit.com](https://www.myvelofit.com/fit-academy/ride-report-the-rift-2022/#:~:text=The%20course%20this%20year%20was,and%20mind%20through%20their%20paces)</u>.

## **RESULTS & DNF DATA**
According to official timing (tímataka.net):
* **2022:** 441 starters, 440 finished (~100% completion)<u>[timataka.net](https://timataka.net/therift2022/urslit/?race=4&cat=overall#:~:text=Started%20%2F%20Finished)</u> (1 DNF).
* **2023:** 538 started, 537 finished (100%)<u>[timataka.net](https://timataka.net/therift2023/urslit/?race=4&cat=overall#:~:text=Started%20%2F%20Finished)</u> (1 DNF).
* **2024:** 601 started, 571 finished (95%)<u>[timataka.net](https://timataka.net/therift2024/urslit/?race=4&cat=overall#:~:text=Started%20%2F%20Finished)</u> (30 DNFs).
* **2025:** 77 started, 77 finished (100%)<u>[timataka.net](https://timataka.net/therift2025/urslit/?race=2&cat=overall#:~:text=Started%20%2F%20Finished)</u>.
* In short, DNFs have been very low (typically <5% of starters)
* <u>[timataka.net](https://timataka.net/therift2022/urslit/?race=4&cat=overall#:~:text=Started%20%2F%20Finished)</u><u>[timataka.net](https://timataka.net/therift2024/urslit/?race=4&cat=overall#:~:text=Started%20%2F%20Finished)</u>.
## **SUFFERING ZONES**
* **Beats (First 60–70%):** Dubbed the “Beat Down,” the first ~120 km contains ~90% of the climbing (~1600 m)<u>[myvelofit.com](https://www.myvelofit.com/fit-academy/ride-report-the-rift-2022/#:~:text=The%20first%2060,incredibly%20fast%20and%20flowy%20sections)</u>. This section is relentlessly uphill on rough lava/gravel, taking a heavy toll before the final flats.
* **Washboard Gravel:** Mid-course washboards are notorious. One racer said these sections on the “backside” *“can be brutal”* and would “literally grind us to almost a complete stop”<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/the-rift-2023/80154#:~:text=The%20course%20is%20awesome%20with,complete%20stop%20a%20few%20times)</u>. (These forced riders to slow, navigate with care, and led many to seek suspension forks afterwards.)
* **Thor’s Hammer Climb:** A steep false-summit near Hekla volcano (“Thor’s Hammer”) is frequently cited as a key pain point<u>[gravelcyclist.com](https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-2019-the-rift-hvolsvollur-iceland-by-anne-moore/#:~:text=to%20tackle%20the%20river%20crossings,was%20harder%20to%20see%20from)</u>.
* **Extended Exposure:** Long stretches of open highland gravel (and occasional black-sand) mean hours of sun/wind exposure and no shade or shelter.
## **EQUIPMENT CONSENSUS (volcanic terrain setup)**
* **Bike/Tires:** A sturdy gravel bike with very wide tires is advised. Examples: a rider on a Lauf True Grit ran 42/50 gearing and 44 mm WTB tires (tubeless)<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/the-rift-2021-iceland-gravel-race/42053?page=3#:~:text=Bike%3A%20Lauf%20True%20Grit%20AXS,Two%20500%20ml%20bottles)</u>. Others chose fat gravel tires (e.g. 29×2.8″<u>[davidgabrys.com](https://www.davidgabrys.com/blog/the-rift-iceland-gravel-race#:~:text=The%20surface%20of%20the%20gravel,the%20Teravail%20Rutland%20gravel%20tires)</u> or 40–42 mm gravel tires<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/the-rift-2023/80154#:~:text=In%202021%20I%20ran%2042mm,42mm%20tire)</u>) for the sharp volcanic rock and washboards.
* **Tubeless/Protection:** Almost everyone goes tubeless and carries repair gear. One wrote: *“I will be carrying a patchkit and a tube… along with my tubeless plug kit”*<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/the-rift-2021-iceland-gravel-race/42053?page=3#:~:text=The%20gravel%20is%20not%20like,YouTube)</u>, noting how remote the route is. (Forum comments agreed more volume = more comfort over lava; one racer said his 42s “felt too small” for sandy washouts<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/the-rift-2023/80154#:~:text=Noegros%20%20July%2023%2C%202023%2C,8%3A39am%20%2020)</u>.)
* **Suspension Fork:** Many added (or wished for) suspension to tame washboards. Riders joked about commandeering Lauf forks—e.g. *“quite a few guys with Laufs… I was definitely considering knocking one off their bikes and taking it”*<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/the-rift-2025-iceland-gravel-race/97326#:~:text=suspension%20fork)</u>.
* **Gear/Clothing:** In addition to a rain shell and warm layers, racers often carry two bike bottles and a full tool kit (extra tubes, pump, multi-tool) due to no outside assistance on course.
## **LOGISTICS**
* **Getting There:** Most participants fly into Keflavik Airport, take a bus to Reykjavik, then a (free) shuttle to Hvolsvöllur – the race base<u>[davidgabrys.com](https://www.davidgabrys.com/blog/the-rift-iceland-gravel-race#:~:text=Evan%2C%20Frank%20and%20I%20grabbed,mountain%20bike%20legend%20Tinker%20Juarez)</u>.
* **Camping/Lodging:** In recent years organizers offered free camping at the Hvolsvöllur campground (used by “dozens” of riders)<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/the-rift-2023/80154#:~:text=In%202021%20The%20Rift%20actually,start%20and%20all%20the%20festivities)</u>. Others stay at local guesthouses or campgrounds (e.g. Midgard Base Camp hosted dinners before the race). Hvolsvöllur has basic shops and restaurants, but nothing bike-specific outside race weekend.
* **Vehicle/Space:** Car rentals in Iceland are expensive. One forum party of 6 people managed to fit 4 bikes into two small hatchbacks by carefully packing bikes in cases<u>[trainerroad.com](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/the-rift-2023/80154#:~:text=We%20had%206%20people%20and,did%20use%20it%20later%20in)</u>. Campervans are popular for additional space. (Advice: arrive early to load/disassemble bikes, or use services to store bike boxes.)
* **Organizer Support:** Event staff (Lauf team) are highly involved. For instance, when a rider’s bike was lost in transit, the team provided a replacement bike and even shoes<u>[davidgabrys.com](https://www.davidgabrys.com/blog/the-rift-iceland-gravel-race#:~:text=Matt%20arrived%20in%20time%20for,They%20deserve%20a%20huge%20kudos)</u>. Volunteers also provide multiple aid stations with food/water; outside personal support is not allowed on course by rule.
