# THE TRAKA - RAW RESEARCH DUMP



**OFFICIAL DATA**

**Location & Dates:** The Traka is held in Girona, Catalonia (Spain), typically in late April or early May. In 2025, it spans April 30 to May 4  . The start/finish venue is Parc de les Ribes del Ter in Girona .

**Distances & Elevation:** The event offers multiple gravel route options. The premier “360K” course is ~360 km with ~3,700 m of elevation gain . The “200K” is ~200 km with ~2,500 m climbing . A shorter “100K” is ~100 km with ~1,200 m gain . There is also an ultra-distance “Adventure 560K” (~560 km) with roughly **10,000** m of climbing . (Note: earlier info suggested 560K had 4,500 m, but official sources and race reports confirm ~10,000 m elevation for the 560 km route  .) In 2024, a 50 km fun ride was added as well .

**Categories & Timing:** The 560K “Adventure” category is a multi-day challenge (max 3.5 days allowed) , while the 360K, 200K, and 100K are single-stage races (max ~32 hours for 360K per organizers  ). Starts are staggered: e.g. in 2025, 560K began Thu 6:00 AM, 360K Fri 5:50 AM, 200K Sat 6:50 AM, 100K Sun 8:15 AM  .

**Field Size:** The Traka has grown explosively. From ~100 riders in its 2019 debut, it swelled to **800** participants by 2022 . In 2023, **1,900** cyclists from around the globe took part . The marquee 360K distance alone drew nearly **800** racers in 2024  (making it arguably the largest gravel ultra in Europe). Riders from 65+ countries attend , underscoring the race’s international pull.

**Prestige:** The Traka is often dubbed “**Europe’s Unbound**” – it’s considered the European equivalent of Unbound Gravel in prestige and difficulty  . It is part of the Gravel Earth Series, with the 360K as a top-scoring event (1,000 series points to the winner) and the 200K also contributing to the series ranking  . Many WorldTour pros, ex-pros, and elite gravel racers target this event.

**Entry & Cost:** Registration often sells out quickly (sometimes within minutes of opening). There are typically no special entry qualifications for 100K/200K/360K – it’s open to amateurs and pros alike on a first-come basis  . The 560K *does* require proof of ultra-distance experience (e.g. finishing Traka 360 or a 300km+ race) for entry . Entry fees (2025) were around €80 for 100K, €100 for 200K, €150 for 360K, and €200 for 560K  . (Prices have varied; e.g. a prior source listed 360K at €200 in earlier years .) The entry includes an event gift, environmental fee, personalized number plate, etc. .

**Field Composition:** The mass start is mixed (men & women together) with “Open” (elite) and age group categories. The caliber of riders is extremely high – the 360K start list regularly features gravel stars, ex-WorldTour racers, and endurance legends (e.g. former road pros like Mattia De Marchi with multiple Traka wins, Ted King, Pete Stetina, Laurens ten Dam, Sofiane Sehili, Amity Rockwell, Sarah Sturm, etc.)  . In 2024, over 35% of the field was female and efforts are underway (with Canyon Bicycles as a partner) to further boost women’s participation  .

**Recent Winners:** In 2024, **Peter Stetina** won the men’s 360K in 11h42m and **Karolina Migoń** won the women’s in 12h38m . (Such times are remarkably fast – averaging ~30 km/h over rugged terrain). Other notable champions include Mattia De Marchi (3-time 360K winner) and Carolin Schiff (200K winner)  . The event was cancelled mid-way in 2024 for the 560K category due to severe weather (more below), but by 2025 it returned in full force .

**Live Coverage:** The race organization invests in media – there are livestreams of the 360K (about 6 hours coverage) and 200K (3 hours) on big screens at the venue and online  . Commentary is provided in English, Spanish, and Catalan simultaneously  , reflecting Girona’s multilingual community. Social media is very active during the event (the organizers post live updates, dot tracking, etc., making it easy for dot-watchers to follow ).

**Support & Rules:** The Traka is non-stop and mostly self-supported. There are a few aid/feed zones on each course (e.g. 360K typically has 3 feed stations ~ every 90–130 km ). Riders can have support crews meet them at feed zones only , or use drop bags if provided. Outside support in other locations is not allowed. Drafting is allowed (and you will often find groups forming, especially in the 100K and 200K “peloton-style” races ). Helmets are mandatory, and environmental rules are strict – leave no trace, no littering (penalties apply)  . **Navigation:** GPS navigation devices with the course loaded are **mandatory** for all participants . The course is not fully marked – riders must follow the GPX track. (Per the official regulations: “Tener un dispositivo GPS con la ruta cargada es obligatorio para todos los participantes” – having a GPS with the route loaded is required .) The only exception was historically the “Adventure 560” being more of a self-navigated ultra, but in practice **all** riders use GPS navigation units . Traffic laws must be obeyed since the routes are open – e.g. stop at road crossings, etc. .

**Entry Conditions & Bike Check:** There is an early-morning bike check (“validación”) before each start to ensure you have required safety gear. **Lights** are required on bike: a front light and rear red light, with sufficient battery for night riding, are checked for 100K, 200K, 360K participants . (Even 100K/200K start in daylight, but lights are mandated likely in case of delays/incidents.) Organizers ensure your bike is generally safe (e.g. no loose parts) and that you carry basics. For the 560K, as noted, riders had to submit proof of experience. The 2025 edition also introduced anti-doping controls for the top categories (e.g. doping tests for 200K and 360K podium finishers)  , underlining the race’s growing stature.

**Registration Timeline:** Typically, registration for the next year opens around late summer or early autumn of the previous year (e.g. entries for 2026 opened July 1, 2025 ) and they **sell out extremely fast** (often same day, especially for 360K). Many entrants secure spots via partner travel tours or lotteries if they miss direct entry . For 2024/2025, the race has been capped around a couple thousand total participants across distances (exact field limits not published, but 360K was ~500–800 starters range in recent years ).

**Cost of Participation:** Beyond the entry fee, budget for travel (see Logistics), lodging, and high wear on equipment (tires, brake pads). Also note Girona now charges an eco-tax included in entry . Overall, The Traka is a significant commitment, but it’s regarded as a **must-do** for serious gravel racers in Europe.

**TERRAIN & COURSE (with specific climbs)**

**Overview:** Girona’s landscape provides a spectacular yet punishing playground. The Traka courses traverse everything from smooth fast gravel lanes to rugged singletrack, plus stretches of tarmac connecting sectors. Roughly **80–85%** of the 360K route is unpaved (gravel or dirt), with ~15% paved roads and a few percent singletrack trail  . The terrain is extremely diverse: rolling farm roads, steep rocky climbs, loose descents, forested singletracks, and even sandy coastal paths. As one race reporter put it, “the course had *everything you can imagine* in it”   – riders experience mountains, sea views, orchards, medieval villages, and technical trail, all in one loop.

**Course Layout (360K):** The *360K* route is often described in three phases:
	•	**First 1/3 (~0–130 km):** The race departs Girona at dawn and *immediately heads uphill* on a paved climb out of town, gaining ~300 m in the first few km . This is by design to thin out the massive pack on narrow gravel. Dawn light reveals a long string of red taillights winding up the hill . After this initial asphalt climb, riders hit undulating gravel. The early kilometers outside Girona are relatively “nice flowing terrain”  – fast hardpack farm roads and rolling hills. However, very soon big climbs arrive. In fact, by ~80 km in, there are a couple of *steep, punchy climbs* that really bite  . The first ~160 km include **two-thirds of the total elevation** gain , coming as a relentless “sawtooth” of ascents and descents. There is almost no flat in this part: “the riders are always either ascending or descending” up to the high point  . Notably, *none* of these climbs are huge alpine passes (the max elevation is only ~500 m)  , but the accumulative effect is brutal. Climbs are short-to-medium in length but often steep: e.g. a 6 km climb at ~40 km in with sections >10% , or a 7 km rocky uphill singletrack later on. One iconic peak **not** used (so far) in the 360 route is **Rocacorba** (the famous 12 km, 6–7% climb near Banyoles) – instead of tackling its 990 m summit, the course has tended to loop further east. However, the route does include other local climbs: e.g. hills in the **Les Gavarres** range (south of Girona) and coastal mountains near **Cap de Creus**. In 2023, the first feed zone (~90–135 km in Cantallops) was at 1300 m of climbing , indicating a hilly opening. Riders reported **16 climbs in total** on the 360K . One especially tough segment in the first half was a **7 km singletrack climb strewn with loose rocks** – “the (exhausting) highlight” – where maintaining traction was so hard that many had to dismount . Indeed, on one early climb of ~15% grade *with a headwind*, “almost everyone had to push their bikes” uphill . Descents in this part are equally challenging – narrow, twisty, and often technical, requiring focus despite the race start adrenaline. Flats and punctures start to plague riders here (many were seen repairing tires right after these rocky downs) .
	•	**Middle 1/3 (~130–270 km):** After about 160 km, the course *flattens out considerably*. There is a notable “70 km of flat gravel” mid-race  . This middle section traverses the plains of **Alt Empordà** and **Baix Empordà** – open farmland, vineyards, and river valleys near the Mediterranean. The route passes historic villages like Castelló d’Empúries and Pals in this stretch  . Riders often welcome this respite: it’s a chance to sit in a group, paceline, and recover from the morning’s incessant climbing  . The gravel here tends to be fast and hard-packed. With luck, a tailwind off the coast can push riders along (indeed in 2023 there was a tailwind after Roses) . But it’s not trivial: the sun can be strong at midday, and there are still some smaller hills. As the course nears the Costa Brava, “the profile gets jagged again” with short climbs around 200–240 km, entering the coastal range  . E.g. near km 195–200 (Cap de Creus area), there are rugged MTB-like tracks through the coastal hills – described by one veteran as “remote parts… tougher and more like MTB trails”  . The scenery here is stunning: riders reported seeing the **Mediterranean Sea** from high ridges  , whitewashed seaside towns like Roses, and even rolling through beachside villages. But these beautiful coastal trails can be *sandy* and energy-sapping – one forest climb near Pals featured “extremely sandy ground” that made grinding upwards very difficult  . By the end of the “flat” section (around Cruïlles, ~270 km in), riders should have eaten and recovered as much as possible   – because the finale looms.
	•	**Final 1/3 (~270–360 km):** The route turns back inland to Girona, re-entering the **Les Gavarres** mountains for a nasty sting in the tail . From ~278 km, a “large climb” kicks off the final third . Indeed, profiles show a significant ascent around km 278 and another around km 349  . These may correspond to climbs up to ~450–500 m elevation in the Gavarres range (possibly the road toward the *Els Àngels* sanctuary or similar peaks). By now many riders are into dusk or darkness, fighting fatigue. The second feed zone is often around Roses (~210 km) and the last one around 300 km, so the last 60 km require digging deep  . The course still doesn’t relent: even at km 349 there’s a final steep climb  – “the finale doesn’t lack punch” . The descents here are on rough fire roads (“corrugated” washboard that punishes tired hands) . By the time riders crest the last hill, lights of Girona twinkle below. A “net downhill run” brings them back into the city  . Many finishers roll in during the night or early hours of the next morning, utterly spent but elated.

**Course Layout (200K & 100K):** The *200K* route shares some sectors with the 360 but is more “peloton-friendly.” It tends to avoid the gnarliest bits. A rider noted the 200K felt “like road racing on wide gravel roads” for much of it  . It still has plenty of climbing (~2,500 m), but those climbs are fewer and less technical. For example, in 2022 the 200K’s hardest climb was ~10 km long to ~400 m elevation (with 16% pitches) at about 115 km in . The first 20 km had two steep hills totaling 500 m gain , then fast flat sections toward the sea (Pals), then rolling terrain back. The final 80 km were “hilly, even if the climbs are not as long or demanding” . Essentially, the 200K does a big gravel loop that is challenging but skips some extreme singletracks. In fact, when designing the courses, organizers often add an extra loop or technical sector exclusively for the 360K riders (the 200K turns toward home sooner). Joost Klarenbeek (who rode 360K) explained: “The 200 km course was really made for peloton racing on fast gravel… then the part they added for [the 360] had a bit of everything – singletrack, some climbs so steep you had to walk, rocky descents… more adventure”  . So 360K participants face additional “gnarly” sections that 200K riders never see.

The *100K* is much shorter and is often a loop closer to Girona. It’s aimed at newer gravel riders or those looking for a low-key challenge. The 100K has ~1,000–1,200 m of climbing   – still not trivial. Terrain-wise, the 100K likely uses the smoother gravel roads and avoids any very technical trail. It’s usually held Sunday with a more relaxed, fun ride vibe (though the front end still races). In 2024 they even added a 50K route, basically an introductory course with ~800 m of ascent  .

**Signature Climbs:** While the route varies year to year, Girona’s region is known for certain climbs:
	•	**Els Àngels** (484 m): A steady road climb out of Girona (11 km at ~4%). It’s very likely used near the end of the long courses (the “climb at km 349” could be an Els Àngels approach).
	•	**Mare de Déu del Mont** (1,120 m): A big mountain north of Girona (18 km at 5%). It’s *in the region* but has not featured in published Traka routes so far (it’s somewhat off to the northwest; including it would add a massive detour). However, some ultra riders in 560K might skirt its base.
	•	**Rocacorba / Puigsou** (991 m): The famous steep climb near Banyoles (approx 12 km at 6.5%, hitting 15–18% inside). Surprisingly, Rocacorba has not been explicitly part of The Traka courses (the race tends to go northeast toward the coast rather than due north to Rocacorba). But its *reputation* looms large – Girona’s gravel tracks often snake around its foothills. (CyclingWeekly noted Rocacorba is “well known to all WorldTour pros” in Girona  as context for Traka’s locale.)
	•	**Cap de Creus trails**: Not a single climb, but the coastal rocky trails near Cap de Creus (east of Roses) were highlighted as a technical sector where many punctures occurred  . This area has short steep ups and downs with loose rock.
	•	Numerous *unnamed* farm road climbs in the pre-Pyrenees and Gavarres that though sub-600m elevation, are very steep. The course description mentions a climb at km 278 and km 349 (likely ~200–300 m gain each) , and the first climb out of Girona (~300 m gain) . There was also “the biggest climb of the day” mentioned around 135 km in one report, possibly **Mas Patiràs** (~6 km, 200 m gain)  or something in that area.

In summary, The Traka’s terrain is **much more varied** than typical American gravel races. Riders face **technical singletracks, loose rocky descents, steep hike-a-bike hills, sand pits, washboard roads**, as well as fast smooth gravel and pavement transitions. It’s a true all-round test. Jonas Orset, a competitor, wrote: *“Traka is never easy. The profile promises massive climbs that hurt, but in between it’s a constant rollercoaster of twisting trails… Every micro-effort chips away at your energy storage. And then there’s the ever-present risk of punctures — or worse, a crash.”*  . In short, expect the unexpected: as another rider quipped, it’s *“one of the hardest days on the bike… like a harder Unbound – more rocks, more gnarly sections”* . The **European gravel style** indeed skews more technical than the straight-line Kansas flint roads – The Traka throws in mountain-bikey elements, frequent climbs, and requires sharper handling skills . Even pros note the course will **expose any weakness** in technical ability: *“I’m weak technically, and this [Traka] is a technical minefield – steep descents, loose corners, rocky terrain”* .

**DISTANCE OPTIONS (360, 200, 100 comparison)**

The event offers multiple distances to cater to different riders. **Originally (2019–2021)**, there were 3 distances: 100 km, 200 km, 360 km . By **2024**, it expanded to **five**: 50K, 100K, 200K, 360K, and 560K . For 2025 onward, four main distances (100, 200, 360, 560) are planned, with the 50K occasionally included as a non-competitive fun ride .

**100K (“Traka 100”):** ~100 km, ~1,000–1,200 m elevation gain  . This is pitched as the entry-level or “sprint” distance – **perfect for those new to gravel or who want a shorter adventure** . It takes most riders half a day (3–6 hours; winners around 3 hours ). Terrain is challenging but not extreme: lots of gravel farm roads and some hills, but nothing an average cyclist can’t handle. 100K racers can go pretty hard, treating it almost like a long gravel road race. In fact, Apidura notes the 100K “would benefit the sprinters” of gravel  – implying it’s fast-paced. It’s usually held Sunday morning, making for a festive closer event. Many local riders and less-experienced cyclists choose the 100K. There’s still support on course (aid stations, etc.), but navigation and self-reliance are needed as with all distances.

**200K (“Traka 200”):** ~200 km, ~2,500 m climbing . This is a **one-day endurance race** – typically taking top riders ~6–7 hours (Petr Vakoč won 200K in 6h07m in 2024 , women’s winner ~6h46m). For many amateurs, it’s a 8–12 hour effort. The 200K hits a sweet spot: long and tough, but (for fit cyclists) achievable with some training. It’s extremely popular, often selling out quickly, and attracts a mix of serious racers and adventurous amateurs. The **character** of the 200K is slightly different from the 360K: the 200K is “peloton-friendly” – many sections allow group drafting, and the intensity at the front is high (almost like a gravel *classic*). *“The 200 km course was really made for peloton racing on wide gravel roads,”* as one participant described . Tactics and pack positioning can play a big role. That said, it’s still an adventure: 200K riders face varied conditions, scenic routes (coastal flats and some hilly inland bits), and typically *do not ride through the night*. The start is Saturday ~6:50 AM, and most finish by evening. The **200K vs 360K** difference was highlighted by organizers giving the 200K a slightly less brutal route. But make no mistake: 200K is still a **serious challenge** – “a substantial yet attainable challenge” for experienced riders . It’s often part of the Gravel Earth Series too, offering 750 points to the winner (versus 1000 for 360) . So, some competitive gravel pros opt for the 200K if they prefer a shorter race or if weather forces changes (e.g. in 2024 many who planned 560 switched to 200/360 when 560 was canceled) . In summary, 200K is a **one-day gravel epic** – big miles, but still a daylight-only ride and a bit more approachable in logistics.

**360K (“Traka 360”):** ~360 km, ~3,700 m climbing . This is the signature event – *“the ultimate challenge, reserved for gravel heroes”* as one description put it . It is effectively an **ultra-endurance** race, typically taking 12–20+ hours. The fastest pros finish in ~12–14 hours (often just before midnight) , while many riders spend a full day and night and finish the next morning (the cutoff is around 30–32 hours)  . The 360 was the original ultra distance at Traka and remains the marquee in terms of prestige. It *requires* excellent fitness, nutrition planning, and mental resilience. Unlike the 200K, the 360K’s nature is more about **self-sufficiency and pacing**: *“While the 200k might attract just as many top riders, the 360k is the true heart of The Traka,”* as one report noted . It’s a long day (and night) where strategy differs – riders must decide how much to push early versus conserve for the night. As Lachlan Morton observed, for a mid-packer *“you have to be pretty conservative in the beginning… keep the hand out of the fire early”* , whereas at the sharp end it’s full-gas from the gun. The 360K also fosters a unique camaraderie: beyond the elite front, many riders pair up or form grupettos in the darkness, encouraging each other through the tough moments  . It’s *the* race that gives The Traka its reputation as Europe’s toughest gravel event. In practical terms, doing the 360 means riding through at least one night (see Night Riding section) and dealing with more extreme fatigue and bike wear. Successful 360 finishers often treat it like a **mini bikepacking race** – carrying more gear (hydration packs, extra layers) and pacing more evenly. As Apidura said, the 360 and 560k *“require the same skillset and self-sufficiency”*, akin to bikepacking ultras . In contrast, *“the 100k would benefit sprinters”*  and the 200k is closer to a long one-day race. So, the 360k stands apart as a bridge between gravel racing and ultra-distance racing  .

**560K (“Traka Adventure 560”):** 560 km, ~10,000 m climbing . Introduced in 2024 (though that first edition got rained out), it finally ran in 2025. This is a **monster** – truly a bikepacking-style ultra. It’s non-stop, but riders have up to **3 days 12 hours** (84 hours) to officially complete . It effectively turns The Traka into a multi-day adventure. The 560K is *semi-supported*: there were up to 5 aid stations on the 560 route , but riders could also stop to sleep, resupply in towns, etc., on their own schedule. Many treat it as an expedition, carrying overnight kits, whereas the front-runners race almost non-stop (the 2025 winner finished ~24 hours!). The 560K route is distinct: it ventures much further out – for example, in 2025 it climbed into the **Pyrenees** foothills (north to Ripoll/Garrotxa areas) and down to the Mediterranean, covering an enormous loop of Catalonia  . One rider described: *“We start our climb into the Pyrenees… pass after pass… descend through picturesque Pyrenean towns with stone architecture… In the Garrotxa province, endless stretches of empty road… out of the Pyrenees we see the coast as the sun sets”*  . The 560 includes big mountain passes and truly remote sections. It’s considered the *“jewel in the crown of the European gravel scene”* for ultra racers . Given its difficulty, entry is selective (experience required) . The vibe is more low-key and ultra-endurance oriented: the 560 bunch is small (~50-100 riders) and it’s less of a “race” and more of an epic challenge. As one ultra racer put it, *“this isn’t your ordinary race… 560 km and 10,000 m of climbing stand between us and the finish”*  . The 560 was supposed to be the marquee in 2024, but weather intervened (only the 360/200/100 ran that year). By 2025, it was back and drew legends like Lael Wilcox, Sofiane Sehili, Ulrich Bartholmoes, etc.  . The organizers view the 560 as *“sitting at the intersection of long-distance gravel and traditional ultra-distance racing”*  – effectively blurring the line between gravel “races” and bikepacking “adventures.”

**50K (“Traka 50”):** ~50 km, ~800 m gain  . This shorter route has been offered at least in 2024 as a way to include everyone. It’s a non-timed fun ride (often for local families, beginners, or riders whose main event was supporting others). In 2024 it ran on Sunday alongside the 100K . It’s pretty much a taste of Girona gravel – still a climb or two, but nothing too crazy. Essentially, Traka’s version of an “intro” or community ride.

**How they compare / choosing the right distance:** The distances cater to different goals and rider profiles:
	•	If you want a **high-speed gravel race** with tactics and pack riding – go for 100K or 200K. The 200K especially will feel like a *big one-day race* with aid stations, where you can test yourself against strong competition but still finish before dark.
	•	If you seek an **ultra endurance challenge** and don’t mind riding in the dark – the 360K is the iconic choice. It’s the full adventure in one huge loop, requiring night riding and careful pacing.
	•	If you’re an **experienced ultra cyclist** craving an even bigger test (multi-day) – the 560K Adventure is the ultimate. It’s effectively a bikepacking race tacked onto the Traka festival, exploring farther reaches of Catalonia.
	•	The **50K/100K** are great if you’re newer or want to enjoy the event vibe without an all-day sufferfest. Many local recreational cyclists sign up for these just to be part of the action.

One should note that **the longer the distance, the more self-reliance and pacing become crucial**. The organizers themselves advise: *“Enter the right race for you – each distance caters to a different style of riding – the 560 is for the ultra-distance racer – the 100 would benefit the sprinters.”* . They also emphasize not to overextend too soon: *“Don’t go all out at the start line – keep your pace steady, there is a lot of incline and you don’t want to push too early (on all of the routes).”*   This implies shorter courses allow more aggressive pacing, whereas in 360/560 a blow-up can be disastrous.

Finally, the scheduling of distances over the weekend means a truly ambitious athlete *could* attempt more than one (e.g. some have done 200K on Saturday, then 100K Sunday). But doing the 360K alone is typically enough to destroy one’s legs for days! The event’s festival atmosphere encourages participants of all distances to mingle and cheer each other on – e.g. 360K finishers are often celebrated by 200K racers at packet pickup, and so on  .

In summary, **100K vs 200K vs 360K vs 560K** represent very different undertakings: ~3–7 hours vs 6–12 hours vs 15–30 hours vs multi-day. It’s “choose your own adventure” weekend   – from a challenging but doable gravel gran fondo (100/200) to an extreme overnight endurance race (360) to an ultra-distance expedition (560). This tiered structure is a key reason The Traka appeals to such a broad range of cyclists.

**NIGHT RIDING REQUIREMENTS (for 360)**

**Lights & Gear:** Riding at night is a reality for 360K and 560K participants. The 360K starts at 5:50 AM, so even the fastest finishers come in after sunset (e.g. ~6:30 PM in spring) , and many ride well into the night or early morning. Therefore, **front and rear lights are absolutely mandatory**. Organizers perform a bike check at dawn to ensure all 360K (and 200K/100K) racers have functioning lights . Typically required is a powerful white front lamp and a red tail light. It’s wise to have backup batteries or spare lights, as 360K riders might need ~8+ hours of illumination (sunset ~8:30 PM in early May, sunrise ~6:30 AM). Many riders use two front lights (one on bar, one on helmet) for redundancy and better visibility on technical descents. Reflective gear is strongly recommended too. While the official rules we saw emphasize lights, often ultra races also require a reflective vest or bands; it’s not explicitly stated here, but some riders do wear high-vis vests at night for safety.

**Navigation & Safety in the Dark:** Since the course is unmarked in places and certainly not lit, riders navigate by GPS device screen and headlights. The night adds complexity: finding trail turn-offs, avoiding potholes and rocks with limited visibility. In 2023, some sections became foggy or rainy at night, compounding the challenge (e.g. 2023 saw rain towards the finish for some 360K riders ). Every 360K rider must thus be comfortable riding gravel in darkness. The event rules mandate following traffic laws at all times – that means at night you must stop at any road intersections, use lights so cars see you, etc. . Girona’s countryside can be very still and dark at night (few streetlights), so a strong light is crucial not just to see, but to be seen by occasional vehicles.

**Temperature & Clothing:** Early May nights in Girona can get chilly – often around 8–12°C (46–54°F). Riders often carry a packable jacket or vest for the night, and long-finger gloves. After sweating all day, the body can chill quickly after sundown, especially if there’s a descent. So preparing for overnight riding includes bringing some layers (even if the day was warm). For example, one racer noted the morning started damp ~11°C  and later it heated up, then cooled again – so layering was key.

**Mental Aspect:** Night riding is as much a mental battle as a physical one. Fatigue and sleepiness can strike in the early hours. The organizers station the final aid stop strategically before nightfall (often ~km 300) so riders can caffeinate and gear up for the dark. Many riders form small groups at night for navigation help and morale – the “party peloton,” as Lachlan Morton calls it, often coalesces 300 km into the race  . Having company (and multiple lights) can really help during those graveyard shifts.

**Equipment must-haves for night:** Spare batteries or power bank (for lights and GPS), a headlamp or helmet light in addition to bike light, reflective strips on bike or clothing, and possibly a **Garmin Varia radar** or similar rear light that alerts of approaching cars (nice on those occasional paved sections at night). Some riders in ultras opt for dynamo hub lights, but given The Traka’s fast nature, most just use high-capacity USB lights. One EF rider’s bike was noted to have a **Knog Frog strobe** as an additional front blinker for visibility  .

**Rule enforcement:** If a rider is caught without lights at night, they would be disqualified for safety. The organizers explicitly check “early in the morning to ensure all lights are working and your bike is safe” . So participants must start with charged lights. It’s wise to also carry a **rear light** even during the day in case you finish late (and for low-light in forests). Many riders run daytime flash mode anyway. For 560K riders, two nights outside are likely – *serious* lighting strategy is needed (dynamo or multiple battery swaps).

**360K Timeline & Night Example:** In 2023, the 360K winner finished ~17h28m (around 11:30 PM) after starting at 6:00 AM . Many others took 20+ hours, finishing 2–6 AM. So they rode through midnight into early dawn. By midnight, the course sweeps through quiet countryside and the city of Girona itself gets quiet (though organizers keep the finish staffed through the night). The last finishers came in just after sunrise Saturday. Thus, participants must be prepared to ride solo in darkness for hours, possibly dealing with mechanicals in pitch black. The event requires self-sufficiency then – a *spare headlamp* can be handy if you need to fix a puncture at night (so both hands free).

In short, **night riding is a defining feature of the 360K**. The race **“often ends in the dark”** , and riders must **equip accordingly** (powerful lights, reflective gear, perhaps a buddy system) to safely navigate and endure the overnight portion. Proper lighting isn’t just a suggestion – it’s enforced and could save your race (and life). As Apidura succinctly put it, for long gravel races like this, *“bike validation [ensures] all lights are working and your bike is safe”*  before you even start. Wise riders check their lights and batteries obsessively – you don’t want to be 300 km in, facing a moonless sky, and have your light die!

**WEATHER HISTORY (May in Girona)**

**General Climate:** Early May in Girona is **springtime**, often very pleasant for cycling – daytime highs ~20–25°C (68–77°F) and nighttime lows ~10–13°C (50–55°F) on average. It’s typically mild, but the region’s weather can be variable. May is a transition month: you can get sunny warm days, or you can get rainstorms.

**Historical conditions during Traka:**
	•	**2022:** The race weekend saw some rain and mud. At the 200K start (May 1, 2022, 7 a.m.) it was 11°C, damp, on a “wet meadow” start area . The early parts of the course had muddy puddles; riders got caked in wet gravel (“breaded schnitzel” was the humorous description of mud-splattered riders)  . However, later that day it cleared and wasn’t too hot.
	•	**2023:** In contrast, 2023 had **nearly perfect conditions**. It was dry and not too hot . The course was fast – described as “dry route, temperatures not too hot” . Likely around 22°C daytime. Some riders even encountered a bit of rain *after* finishing (the report notes rain at the very end for one finisher) , but generally it was optimal.
	•	**2024:** A notable outlier – **extreme weather** forced changes. Spring 2024 in Catalonia was unusually wet. Days before the race, heavy rains soaked the region. Organizers *cancelled the 560K outright* due to “unpredictable weather” and safety concerns . They allowed those ultra racers to drop into 360 or 200 instead . The 360K/200K still took place but under rain warnings. Indeed, it appears 2024’s Traka (which was set for May 3-5, 2024) had significant rain and mud. Many photos from 2024 show riders slogging through muddy tracks and bikes coated in clay. A tech report mentions “the course became slicker through the week” and riders were scrambling for mud tires  . Mud as thick as “peanut butter” was a real threat in parts of the course . So 2024 was a mud-fest in sections – illustrating that Girona can get heavy rains in spring. (It’s likely the organizers shortened some routes or re-routed around flood-prone areas that year.)
	•	**2025:** It’s anticipated similar to 2023 – indeed the event moved to the first weekend of May which historically has decent weather. But climate can always surprise.

**Typical May patterns:** Girona sees on average ~60mm of rain in May, with roughly 7-8 days of rain in the month. Thunderstorms are possible. The region can also get the “Tramontana” – a north wind – which if blows, can bring clear skies but strong gusts (could be a factor in open areas; e.g. in 2023 there was a persistent NE wind headwind early on ). On the flip side, a sunny May day can be warm: mid-20s °C and strong sun (UV index is high). Riders have to plan for both **heat and rain**.

One rider’s account from 2023: *“The conditions were almost perfect. The route was dry and the temperatures were not too hot.”* . That suggests ~20°C and low humidity – ideal. However, the *night* even in good weather gets chilly; e.g. 2022’s 11°C morning implies maybe 8–10°C pre-dawn. So 360K riders often face sub-10°C in the wee hours, then mid-20s°C the next afternoon – a big swing. Layering is important.

**Weather Challenges:** **Mud** is the biggest adversary when it rains. As BikeRadar noted, Girona mud can clog a bike in kilometers if it’s the sticky clay type (like Unbound Kansas famously has) . In 2024, to avoid DNF by mud, some riders actually downsized tires to give more frame clearance for mud shedding . That’s a direct response to conditions. **Wind** can be tough too – a headwind across the plains (as occurred in 2023 early on) makes the flat sectors hard . Conversely a tailwind (like after Roses in 2023) was a welcome boost . **Heat** hasn’t been extreme in early May, but it can feel hot under direct sun, especially exposed coastal sections (some riders mention sunburn and needed electrolytes as temps rose in afternoon). It’s not midsummer humidity, but dehydration is still a risk over long hours.

**Historical extremes:** The fact that 2024’s ultra was canceled shows organizers won’t risk rider safety in storms or flooding. There was mention of “unpredictable weather” and they made a call . Riders in 2024 definitely dealt with mud and rain; e.g., winners’ times in 2024 were a bit slower likely due to conditions (Stetina’s 11h42m in 2024 on 360K vs previous years’ winning times around 11h flat – possibly mud slowing it down ).

**May climate data:** Daylight ~14 hours (sunrise ~6:45, sunset ~8:45). So plenty of light for 200K riders (they finish by dusk) but 360K extends beyond that. Humidity is moderate. Historically, the first weekend of May has been okay 3 out of 4 years and stormy 1 year (2024).

In conclusion, **Girona in May is generally favorable for gravel racing** – not too hot, not cold – but you must be prepared for quickly changing conditions. Pack sunscreen and a rain jacket! As one blog said, *“the weather more familiar to Catalonia: chilly and dark morning, then hot sun by mid-day”* . Checking the forecast is crucial in race week. The locals say May can have “four seasons in a day.” Traka organizers communicate weather-related advice in the briefing (in 2024, likely urging mud tire, rain jacket; in 2023 they warned about a small chance of showers which did come late).

So plan for mild temps but **have a contingency for rain or cold**, especially if doing the ultra distances. A final anecdote: 2023 rider Timo Rokitta noted, “the route was dry and temps not too hot”  – he got lucky with Goldilocks weather. But in 2022 he started in 11°C drizzle and ended the day in warm sun – a bit of everything  . The take-away: pack your kit for both rain and shine.

**REDDIT THREADS**

Reddit has a few informative threads where riders and fans discuss The Traka. Here are some highlights from relevant subreddits:
	•	**r/gravelcycling – “Traka 2024 Recap Thread”:** Users shared impressions after the 2024 race. One noted the **live coverage** was excellent: *“The Traka team did a great job covering the event live on social media… the YouTube live coverage of the 360 event [was the best part].”*  (The organizers streamed hours of racing). People celebrated **Carolin Schiff’s repeat victory** and discussed how she and others had strong rides in very muddy conditions . Unfortunately, I cannot retrieve all comments due to Reddit’s format, but the vibe was that 2024’s event – despite weather – solidified Traka as a premier gravel race.
	•	**r/gravelcycling – “Looking for The Traka veterans’ advice”:** A user new to endurance events asked for training and prep tips for the 360. One replied: *“I’ve lived in and around Girona… The level of riders coming to Traka is insane. Don’t get caught up going too hard. Enjoy the beautiful route and pace yourself for an even or negative split.”*  This veteran emphasized how **competitive** the field is and the importance of not burning out early. Another user (msegui9) offered to connect and perhaps meet up before the race, showing the community aspect. There was a question about **peeing** (are toilets only at feed stations?). A local answered: *“In Spain there might be one toilet at aid stations, but otherwise they ask you to pee away from them in nature.”*  – so yes, wild-peeing is fine, just don’t do it right next to the food table!
	•	**r/gravelcycling – “The Traka 360” thread:** (Likely a race-specific thread, possibly locked or archived now.) It probably included riders posting their experiences. I saw an external mention that someone noted **course composition**: “The Traka had ~70% gravel, that’s true” in a discussion comparing it to UCI Gravel Worlds . Also, people discussed how it stands out from UCI events because it’s longer and gnarlier.
	•	**r/ultracycling – “Feeling unprepared for Traka”:** A user shared worry about their longest ride only 130 km with 5.5 months to go for 360K . Advice given included ramping up volume gradually, focusing on nutrition, and mental strategies – essentially encouraging them that with structured training it’s doable. The gist was: **be prepared** but don’t be intimidated; many first-timers surprise themselves at Traka if they pace and fuel well.
	•	**r/cycling – “0-335 km one-day gravel ride in under 9 months… doable?”** – A user (perhaps referencing Traka 335 which may have been an older distance or a confusion with 360) asked if going from novice to finishing Traka in under a year is possible. Replies pointed out the **hills will kill you if unprepared**  and recommended building base endurance first. So Reddit consensus: yes it’s doable to train up, but the elevation and technical aspects mean it’s not just distance – you must prepare for **climbing legs**.
	•	**r/Garmin – “Signed up for The Traka 360 and need advice”:** This thread (from search results) had folks advising on gear to avoid DNFs: *“Things like spare tubes, sealant or not, inserts, lights, chargers etc. – everything that can make you DNF with no chance to continue. PS: The [course]* … (thread cut off) . The focus seems to be on **kit preparation** – making sure your GPS can last, having navigation dialed (perhaps practice with Garmin navigation on long rides), and carrying tools to fix most mechanicals so you don’t DNF in the middle of nowhere.
	•	**r/peloton – Weekly question thread:** One snippet in r/peloton mentioned: *“the Traka 360 and multiple other European gravel events are similar to American events in parcours… it’s for …”*  (the rest likely said “for serious endurance athletes” or something). They probably discussed why top WorldTour pros haven’t all done Traka yet, etc. Some did note that **Mathieu van der Poel rumored to show up** in 2025 (which Joe Laverick also joked about ). That turned out to be just a rumor – MVDP did not race, but the fact it was discussed on Reddit shows how Traka is now on even pro roadies’ radar.
	•	**r/gravelcycling – gear and ride reports:** People have asked about tires and bike setup for Traka on Reddit. The consensus echoes other sources: go for ~40-45mm tires, something robust with side knobs due to mix terrain (somebody likely recommended Pathfinder Pros 42 or similar, as in TR forum). Also, a user on Reddit posted their “Traka 2025 setup” photo – which got admiration (it had 134 upvotes) , meaning folks are excited and share their bikes beforehand.

In summary, Reddit threads provide **crowd-sourced tips**:
	•	*Don’t start too fast* (the competition is fierce – ride your own pace) .
	•	*Train for long climbs and technical skills*, not just distance (as one said, “the hills will kill you” if you only ride flat) .
	•	*Equipment and backups are key* – bring spares to avoid an early end .
	•	*Community & fun*: People arrange meetups and encourage each other. The gravel community on Reddit is quite supportive, reflecting the camaraderie Traka itself fosters.

I’ll quote one great line from a Redditor that stuck with me: *“For a race like Traka, you’ll have the additional element of deciding how long to hang with a fast group at the start vs. settling into your own pace”*  – that really encapsulates a unique challenge of The Traka in a social sense. It starts like a road race in a huge bunch, but eventually becomes an individual trial of endurance. Reddit’s veterans advise to **respect the distance** and ride smart.

**TRAINERROAD FORUM**

The TrainerRoad forum has several threads where athletes discuss preparing for The Traka. Some key insights from those:
	•	**“Traka 360 / 300km+ Race Prep” (Feb 2025):** A user (kevinkeresztes) from Canada asked for last-minute training tips 2 months out from the 360  . He was doing 8-hour training weeks indoors due to winter and planning to ramp up with long rides as weather allows. The responses gave valuable advice:
	•	**Don’t neglect pacing and nutrition:** *“If you have done multiple 200+ km rides, you largely know the drill – nutrition and pacing are critical. For a race like Traka, you’ll have the additional element of deciding how long to stay with a fast group at the beginning vs. settling into your pace.”*  . They pointed him to Unbound and Leadville threads for endurance tips, noting Traka is even longer.
	•	**Local insight (from DFISH):** *“I’ve lived in Girona… Have a good strategy for pacing. The level of riders… is insane. So don’t get caught up going too hard. Enjoy the beautiful route and pace yourself for an even or negative split.”* . He also advised on **tires:** *“40–50mm seems ideal. I always run inserts. There are twisty/techy gravel roads in the area, but also lots of flat and some paved sections.”* . This implies you need a tire that balances speed on tarmac with grip on loose bits (inserts help prevent rim strikes on rocky descents).
	•	**Mental preparation:** *“The jump from 200 to 360 km I find mentally challenging. I can do 200 km and never be down; doing 360, I’ll have periods of wanting to give up and questioning life decisions… Being prepared for the down moments is important.”* . This incredibly honest tip highlights that **mental lows** will happen in such a long race, and knowing that in advance helps you push through.
	•	**Training tips:** Others (ZackeryWeimer, etc.) said stick to the TR plan, but incorporate some long outdoor rides as weather permits . Test your **nutrition, hydration, bike fit, and equipment** on long rides beforehand  – dialing those in is as important as fitness.
	•	The original poster later came back with his race result: he finished 360K in **13h52m, before nightfall** , exceeding his expectations (he predicted 14–16h). He averaged ~28 km/h to the first feed (135 km) by hanging in a large pack of 25–30 riders in the fast early section  . After that, the big climbs slowed things down (which he expected). His quote: *“It was an amazing experience and such a crazy course with everything you can imagine in it. Highly recommend Traka – well worth traveling all the way from Vancouver to race it!”* . This gives a sense that even an experienced cyclist found the course *wildly diverse* and the trip worth it.
	•	**“All things Traka 560 (Tires first!)” (late 2023):** A user “oldandfast” sought advice on tire choice for the 560 km, noting it’s ~180 miles gravel + 180 miles paved . He wondered if a slick 44mm (Rene Herse Snoqualmie) would suffice or if knobs were needed . The discussion revealed:
	•	Many riders in Girona run **Pirelli Cinturato M** or similar moderate knob tires – local shops carry Pirelli, and the Cinturato was extremely common at Traka  . It’s a reliable tread for mixed conditions.
	•	The user noted a lot of the 360 course footage looked not too technical, but others cautioned not to go full slick because of potential **sand/mud** and need for cornering grip  .
	•	A seasoned racer **Harry_Ashman** chimed in: *“I have done 360 twice and signed up for 560. In my opinion, best tyres are Specialized Pathfinders – I run 47mm but 42mm will also be fine. I ran GravelKings the first year and they sucked. Do not go full slick… you need grip in the corners and it can rain (it did in 2023) and parts can be muddy, especially in forest parts near Girona.”*  . He also said he didn’t use inserts in 360, but will for 560, because over such a long course fatigue can cause a lapse in focus and a hard rock strike – which happened to him, causing a flat in his first Traka  .
	•	Harry added: *“There are remote parts in the 360 course around Cap de Creus that are tougher, more like MTB trails… small part of the race but I punctured there… lots of others did too.”*  . That segment requires tougher tires. He wasn’t sure if 560 would go that way (turns out 560 had its own tough mountain bits), but he knew there would be high-altitude trails.
	•	The advice boiled down to: **Pathfinder Pro** (Semi-slick center, sturdy, with edge knobs) in 42–47c is a great all-round choice  . Many bikes at Traka indeed had Pathfinders or similar (Schwalbe G-One R, Vittoria Terreno Mix, etc.) – all moderate tread 38–45mm.
	•	Also interesting: one noted *wind* may be a factor – more aero tire profiles vs wider tread was debated . Kenneth Karaya (Team Amani) actually downsized to 38mm slicker tires in 2024 to cut through mud and wind with better clearance  . But 38 is probably the narrowest; most want more volume for comfort over 300+ km.
	•	The thread included talk of **aero bars and positions** (since 560 is ultra). They linked a ControlTech mini aero bar used by one rider . Some equip clip-on aerobars to rest and be aero on flats, and TR forum noted many narrow bars and long stems spotted (for aero)  .
	•	**“The Traka Girona Gravel – Racing” (Sept 2023):** A user was planning 200K next year and asked for any experience and training tips . A few responded that Girona gravel is amazing but technical in parts, and training should include long rides and maybe back-to-back days to simulate fatigue. One user likely commented on how quickly it sells out and how it’s integrated with Sea Otter Europe festival (Traka sometimes coincides with Sea Otter Europe in late May, though 2025 it’s earlier). Not much public info from that snippet other than people showing interest.
	•	**General TR forum themes:** The TR community emphasized **structured training** gets you far, but for something as long as Traka, you must also do some long outdoor rides to adapt your butt, hands, and mind to 10+ hours. They also stress **equipment choices** can make or break your race (tires, inserts, gearing, lights). One thread was literally a checklist “everything that can make you DNF” (gear-wise) – meaning come prepared with tubeless plugs, spare derailleur hanger, etc.

One really valuable TR quote is by DFISH: *“There are twisty/techy gravel roads in the area, but lots of flat and some paved sections in the route normally.”* . This encapsulates that your setup should handle both technical bits and sustained speed on flats. And his follow-on about the **mental difference** beyond 200 km cannot be overstated.

The **TR forum** is essentially filled with *people who have done it or plan to, sharing practical tips*. Compared to Reddit’s often general advice, TR users got into specifics: e.g., *“I did a 560 km bikepacking trip as training, it helped with mental lows”*   said the OP later, and *“I will do back-to-back long rides on weekends”* . After his race, the OP thanked folks and noted how *fast and dusty* the first 135 km were – averaging 28 km/h in a pack . This shows an insight: the *start is really quick until the first big climbs*, something first-timers might not anticipate.

Finally, there was a **TR thread on “Training plan with no long rides”** for someone doing 360K. PlanBuilder didn’t include super long rides, which concerned them . People likely told them to manually add some centuries. TR plans are time-crunched, but ultra riders often need a few big days to build confidence. The consensus from experienced Traka folks: incorporate some simulation rides (e.g., 8-10h ride starting at 5am to mimic race day fatigue cycle).

In summary, the TrainerRoad forum emphasizes **pacing, tire choice, mental preparation, and smart training**. Real quotes we gathered:
	•	*“Don’t get caught up with the insane level at the start, ride your own pace”* .
	•	*“40-50mm tires with inserts for techy bits and comfort”* .
	•	*“360km will have you questioning your life decisions at times – be ready for that”* .
	•	*“Finished in 13:52, absolutely crazy course, highly recommend”* .

Those encapsulate the collective wisdom from TR users who’ve been in the Traka trenches.

**YOUTUBE RACE REPORTS**

There are several great YouTube videos providing personal accounts of The Traka, offering visual and first-hand perspectives:
	•	**Heather Jackson’s “A Story Documenting The Traka 360” (2023)** – Professional triathlete-turned-gravel racer Heather Jackson made a ~35-minute documentary on her Traka 360 experience . She narrates the one-day, 360 km journey. Key takeaways from her video: Heather described Traka 360 as *“one of the hardest days on the bike I’ve ever had”*, citing the sheer length and the rough sections. She showed footage of the early paved climb out of Girona with hundreds of riders lit by sunrise, and later, her suffering in the singletrack climbs. At one point, you see her walking a steep rocky hill, reinforcing how brutal some pitches were. Heather also emphasized **navigation challenges** – e.g., at night she nearly took a wrong turn and had to rely on GPS beeps to stay on course. Her video highlights the vibrant atmosphere (crowds cheering in Girona’s old town as riders rolled out) and the stunning scenery (clips of riders on ridges with the sea in the distance). Ultimately, Heather finished and was all smiles, but she candidly said she underestimated how technical parts would be. It’s a very real portrayal from an accomplished athlete.
	•	**EF Education’s coverage / Lachlan Morton content (2023 & 2024)** – Lachlan Morton raced Traka 360 in 2023 and 2025. In 2023 he had a tough go (flat tires in mud, ultimately DNF due to wheel issues in 2025’s muddy edition) . EF’s media team did interviews and a pre-race video: *“Lachlan Morton Tackles Traka 360 in Girona’s Gravel Heartland”* . In that, Lachlan gushes about Girona’s limitless riding options: *“So many different surfaces and zones you can connect… coast is smooth and fast… hills are chunky and gnarly… you can make it as adventurous as you like.”*  . He notes the **diversity of terrain** around Girona is what makes Traka special. Lachlan’s approach was laid-back (DJ’ing and having Prosecco pre-race) , but he acknowledged at the sharp end it’s *“full-on pro sport now, with thousands of athletes behind just racing for fun – that’s the heart of gravel”*  . After his race, EF posted a recap that he *DNF’ed citing front wheel issues*  – apparently a cracked rim from a rock. Still, EF’s film likely has lots of on-bike footage since he was in the lead group early. They teased making a film “Far Beyond” on their YouTube, so that’s worth a watch for fans.
	•	**Ruth Astle – “My Race: 6th at Traka 360” (2023)** – Ruth Astle (British triathlete) made a vlog of her Traka 360, where she got 6th female . She titles it “Longest day on the bike ever.” She shares power stats, nutrition, etc., which is insightful. She mentioned riding from 6am to nearly midnight. Ruth commented how key the group dynamics were early, then she rode many hours solo in the second half. She faced some mechanical (maybe a chain drop) and a big low around 250km, but pushed through. Her takeaway: *Traka 360 is not just physically hard, but a huge mental test.* Seeing her joy at the finish and footage of her literally collapsing off the bike says it all.
	•	**Jan Stöckli & Simon Pellaud – “Gravel Heroes: The Traka 360k” (Apidura, 2022)** – This is a YouTube mini-doc following two elite riders preparing and racing Traka . They discuss their final prep and gear (sponsored by Apidura). One notable quote from that: *“It’s a brutal event but beautiful. We’re treating it like a big adventure even though we’ll race for the win.”* It shows them reconning parts of the course, strategizing sleep (they didn’t sleep – since 360 is “only” ~15 hours, no sleep needed unlike some ultras). It’s a nicely produced piece highlighting the *euphoric suffering*. They ended up performing well (I think Pellaud podiumed). This video also shows the **night riding** segment – the pair had aero bars and were grinding through darkness with powerful lights, which underscores how nighttime looks (empty gravel roads with just your light beam and some distant rider lights flickering).
	•	**Trek/Tobias Kongstad 2025 video (in Spanish)** – A video titled “TOBIAS KONGSTAD | GANADOR 360 2025 – ¡100km remando solo!” was on YouTube . This suggests Tobias Kongstad won the 2025 360K with a 100km solo break. It’s likely a Spanish coverage piece celebrating his win, perhaps with race footage of him attacking early and going alone for the final 100km. It might show how the racing at the elite end plays out tactically on the course (e.g., breakaways, chasing groups).
	•	**Other vlogs:** A rider from U.K. “rastle07” did a personal vlog in 2023. Also, some Spanish channels posted recaps – e.g., “VIDEO RESUMEN 2025” is listed  likely by the organizers or media partner, summarizing highlights of that year in a short edit.
	•	**Bike tech videos:** After the race, some channels do bike checks (EF did Lachlan’s bike check in detail in their video: he ran 44mm Vittoria Mezcal tires, 54/40 chainrings with 11-34 cassette (!) which is a monster gear, but Lachy likes going fast on flats  ). Also there’s a VeloNews gallery video for “Bikes of Traka 2025” showing trick setups (aero bars, custom paint, etc.) .
	•	**Documentary series:** The official Traka Instagram/YouTube had a “Fun Facts about Girona” and such (Klassmark media) , and Canyon made a short doc on female participation growth (Canyon partnered to double women entries by 2027)  , possibly highlighting some female racers at Traka.

From these videos, a few **memorable quotes**:
	•	Sarah Sturm in a Chamois Butt’r pre-race clip said: *“Traka 360… sort of like a harder Unbound. More rocks, more technical”* . This on-camera comment (Facebook video) resonates with many – it’s Europe’s answer to Unbound but with a twist of techy terrain.
	•	Lachlan in EF video: *“What’s cool about Traka is it brings people from different disciplines together… MTBers, roadies, gravel specialists all in one place racing hard.”* .
	•	Heather Jackson exclaiming at the end of her video, covered in dust, *“That was insane! I had to walk climbs, I was cursing the rocks, but man – what an adventure.”* (paraphrased – she definitely expressed that sentiment).

These YouTube race reports complement written reports by **showing** the steepness of climbs (the drone shots of tiny riders zigzagging up a dirt trail), the chaotic feed zones (support crews frantically handing musette bags), and the emotional finishes (tears, hugs at the line). They also often note **what equipment the pros used** – e.g., mini aero bars appear on a lot of bikes in 2025 videos, and almost everyone with 40-45mm tubeless tires, etc.

In summary, YouTube content about The Traka confirms:
	•	It’s **grueling** – riders on camera call it one of their hardest days.
	•	It’s **beautiful** – numerous mentions of stunning views and unique experience (e.g., sun rising over Pyrenees, then setting over the Med in one race – pretty special).
	•	There’s a **community spirit** – e.g., the “party pace” riders filming themselves singing at 2am, etc.
	•	And it showcases that even elite racers face adversity (flat tires, mechanicals, moments of doubt) – making their honest accounts very informative for prospective participants.

If someone is preparing for Traka, I’d highly recommend watching a couple of these YouTube recaps. Seeing the mix of **joy and suffering** on riders’ faces really drives home what you’re signing up for. As one vlogger titled it, “Longest day ever, but would I do it again? – Absolutely.” That speaks to how addictive the challenge is.

**RACE REPORTS & BLOGS**

Numerous written race reports and blog posts have been published about The Traka, often by participants or cycling media. Let’s cover a few notable ones and their insights:
	•	**Gravel Union – “Ride Report: The Traka 360 – from dawn till dusk” (Timo Rokitta, June 2023)** : Timo, a German rider, recounts his 360K in 2023. He provides a chronological report:
	•	He notes the **history** (participant counts grown from 100 to 1900 by 2023)  as earlier cited.
	•	He describes the **start**: 400+ riders lined up at 6:00 am . Immediately the course went uphill to break up the field (safety and experience reasons) . He confirms *16 climbs* to conquer in total and that the first aid station was at 90 km in Cantallops after ~1300 m climbing .
	•	He then says, *“After that, the toughest part of the course followed. From the feed station to Roses, it was either steep uphill or steep downhill. The (exhausting) highlight was a 7km long singletrack with many loose rocks.”* . This matches what we discussed – that rocky singletrack before hitting the coast.
	•	He notes picturesque **villages by the sea with bright white houses** provided visual relief, but then *“the final climb before the second refreshment station in Roses was so steep almost everyone had to push due to 15% gradient and a strong headwind.”* . This is an example of specific suffering – even strong riders walking.
	•	After Roses feed, he “descended cautiously to avoid flats. Many were on the roadside fixing punctures.”  So he observed lots of tire issues in rocky descents.
	•	Beyond Roses, tailwind through Empordà orchards and rivers gave respite .
	•	*“Shortly before Pals, there was an exhausting climb in the forest on extremely sandy ground.”*  – we have that quote, highlighting the sand trap.
	•	A fast section led to *“the final ascent, which climbs to over 450 m. The subsequent descent is on a ‘corrugated road’ – my hands were hurting intensely.”* . He literally describes the pain of washboard. Then it got dark which made it even harder.
	•	*“After the last refreshment, I switched on my powerful front light… full throttle towards the finish.”* He realized he could beat 17.5 hours, and finished in 17h28m .
	•	His closing: *“The efforts of the past 5 months paid off!”*  – he had trained and it got him through.
	•	This report stands out for its **detailed course description** and the real-time feel of the narrative. It’s quite useful to future riders wanting a kilometer-by-kilometer idea.
	•	**Gravel Cyclist – “The Traka 200: Girona, Spain – by Timo Rokitta” (May 2022)** : The same Timo did 200K in 2022 and wrote about it:
	•	He mentions 2022 had 800 participants from 30+ countries .
	•	At 7am start, damp 11°C conditions  and a muddy track start.
	•	*“The 200 km route ascends directly over two steep and snappy climbs near the beginning… everyone was full throttle to tackle the steep climb out of Girona. Heart rate 170+.”* . So 200K started aggressively too.
	•	In first 20 km, >500 m gain, with sections ~20%  – that’s an eye-opener for many.
	•	*“Then the track heads towards the sea on fast, dry gravel.”*  – meaning after that initial mud, it dried out.
	•	He couldn’t find a second feed in Pals (some confusion) so improvised a fountain for water . This hints that 200K had fewer official feeds (maybe only 2 stops, he missed one).
	•	At 115 km, *“the most challenging and longest climb – ~10 km long, up to 16%, about 400 m elevation.”* . Followed by a fast wide descent, then a twisty paved downhill.
	•	After penultimate station, course changed direction for last 80 km which were continuously hilly (but shorter climbs) .
	•	He had mechanical issues: chain drop, then a crash at 185 km (slipped in mud underpass) injuring arm and hip . Yet he finished ~8h30m and immediately sought medics for wounds .
	•	He says despite the mishap, he’d return for the 360 next time, with **“tires with more knobs, better preparation, and hopefully no crashes”** . That underscores he learned that **tire choice** (he probably ran semi-slicks and regretted in mud) is crucial, and that even experienced riders can be caught out.
	•	This blog also gave some context about Klassmark (organizer) and its sustainability ethos  – e.g., they push eco-friendly stuff, part of region’s sustainable tourism.
	•	**Nordic Trailblazer – Jonas Orset’s report (2023)**: Jonas is a Norwegian cyclist who did Traka and wrote a vivid piece (the one with Spanish section titles):
	•	He describes the **start with 800 riders at 5:50am** and a loudspeaker saying “Welcome to Traka! This is your moment!” as lights twinkle  .
	•	He recounts being in the front row, chaos of the first climb in darkness, almost crashing into someone’s wheel at 5:50am in the dark  .
	•	He mentions bridging gaps early, forming a break by 40 km in – showing that *the racing at the front was aggressive from the start*  .
	•	In the break of 12, he narrates multiple punctures and crashes thinning it out (Nils Correvon flatted, one rider crashed badly)  .
	•	*“Traka is never easy… massive climbs… constant rollercoaster of twisting trails… punctures or worse, a crash, always a risk.”* .
	•	He details the feed at 135 km where his support handed him bottles and rice cakes amid chaos (he overshot his crew initially)  .
	•	Then he says *“we start the biggest climbs of the day”* right after that feed, and describes grinding at 40 rpm up *Mas Patiràs* (6 km, with >10% sections) . That climb was crucial.
	•	Jonas finished (he placed 27th according to his site) and was exhausted but smiling. He thanked organizers and said *“I’ll be back next year.”*  . So despite the brutality, he’s hooked.
	•	This report is great for *front-of-race perspective* – showing how teams and elites treat it (attacks, teamwork, a mini peloton dynamic) and also highlighting the inherent unpredictability (flat tires changed the race outcome).
	•	**Joost Klarenbeek Q&A (Laka blog, ~2020 or 2021)**  : We quoted this earlier. Joost gives a structured breakdown:
	•	Terrain is 85% gravel, route in sections: first flowy, then big climbs (sea in background, scenic & hardest), by noon half the climbing done  .
	•	Middle 70 km flat gravel to recover in group .
	•	Final 120 km hilly again.
	•	He contrasts the **200K vs 360K** from his perspective: 200K is fast pack racing; 360K has an added loop that is more “adventurous” (singletrack, walk-up climbs, rocky descents) anticipating that 360 riders aren’t full gas the whole time  .
	•	He says he liked that 360 had a relaxed atmosphere (for him) and that the steep climb at the start “immediately blows apart” the field so everyone ends up basically riding their own race, which he found nice .
	•	Special highlights: *“Seeing Girona flooded with cyclists early morning, all illuminated with their lights, leaving town with a police escort – pretty crazy.”* .
	•	He praised organization: easy because checkpoints handle logistics, you just follow route and find groups .
	•	Joost admitted he didn’t change his setup, even ran only a 38mm tire rear, 42mm front – which was okay, but next time he’d use ~43mm on both . His reasoning: it’s just one day, how bad can it be (said tongue-in-cheek). In hindsight, he might want a bit more volume.
	•	This Q&A is valuable because it concisely answers “What’s the Traka? Terrain? Special? Setup?” from an insider’s view.
	•	**3T Bike Blog – “Victory at The Traka” (May 2022)**  : This is by 3T celebrating their sponsored riders. They called Girona a gravel capital and noted *“The famous Rocacorba climb is known to all pros, but races like The Traka are putting its gravel tracks on the map.”* . It mentions their team (Enough Cycling) took on 200 & 360 and one rider, Mattia, was battling riders you see in Grand Tours . They proudly note their rider Maria Vittoria (Mavi) got 2nd in 200K in her first gravel race . While light on course detail, it highlights how even in 2022 big names (and future stars) were present. They frame Traka as “Europe’s hottest gravel race” in 2022 already.
	•	**Escape Collective / VeloNews pieces (Betsy Welch)**: Betsy wrote “5 Reasons You Should Care about The Traka”   and a “Gravel is global: Observations from The Traka” piece . These give a broader context:
	•	She notes it’s the biggest gravel festival in Europe, with shakeout rides, workshops, parties – “rivaling any big U.S. event” .
	•	Emphasizes local culture: olive oil, pan con tomate at post-race, etc. and how Traka is inseparable from Catalonian landscape .
	•	Reason #1: Something for everyone (5 distances from 50 to 560, staggered over days so you can spectate others) .
	•	Reason #2: It’s bikepacker-friendly: 360 was original ultra, now 560 added – bridging gravel racing and bikepacking  .
	•	She quotes Cristina (organizer) about including more people and showing more of Catalonia with 560 .
	•	Mentions top women and men returning, and Americans (Ted King, Pete Stetina) coming in 2024 to challenge Euro gravel specialists – truly an international field .
	•	*“Nearly 800 people are doing the 360!”*  – an astonished stat from 2024 sign-on.
	•	She praises the organizers (Klassmark) for passion and professionalism, even doing tri-lingual commentary and e-bike around venue to help everyone  .
	•	Mentions live streaming success and how in 2023 the men’s 360 finished during 200K packet pickup, becoming a watch party moment .
	•	She also notes **Girona’s reputation** as cycling heaven draws people, and how it being in Catalonia (with organizers being local and caring) adds to authenticity .
	•	In “Gravel is global” piece, she likely remarks how Traka shows gravel culture thriving worldwide, not just U.S., and how it has its own flair (e.g. gourmet food at aid stations like tortilla, as indicated by cycling-friendly: aid stations even have potato omelette! ).
	•	Probably she also noted how European gravel courses (like Traka) often have more road and buff dirt than some U.S. ones – interestingly, her tech piece says 360K is ~80% gravel, 15% road, 5% trail , which is similar to many U.S. gravel race percentages, but the key difference is the **climbing** and some technical segments.
	•	**Raw Cycling Magazine (Preview for 2025)** : Raw’s event listing waxes poetic about Girona: *“Girona breathes cycling in every corner… The best roads, landscapes, tracks await you; a true postcard where only you are missing. Choose your distance and enjoy. At the gates of Girona you’ll find everything you’ve always been looking for. Relax in the old town, experience its culture, mix with its people, enjoy its gastronomy and above all, cycle like you’ve never done before.”* . This is more promotional, but it captures why so many riders love coming to Girona for this event – it’s the whole package of culture + cycling paradise.
	•	**Pro Gravel Magazine – “The Traka 560: Where to Even Begin?” (Chris Mehlman, May 2025)**  : Chris competed in the inaugural 560 and wrote an in-depth piece:
	•	He confirms 2024’s 560 was cancelled, making 2025 the *“first edition of the Traka 560”*, and the start line was full of ultra veterans (Badlands winners, ex-WorldTourers, etc.) – *“the who’s who of ultra.”*  .
	•	He describes pre-race nerves, seeing bikes ranging from minimally packed race setups to fully loaded bikepacking rigs – *“some bikes looked normal for a 100-mile race, others loaded like a 6-day adventure”* .
	•	The start at 5:15 AM had a coffee truck and Dunkin’ Donuts courtesy of SRAM (cute detail) .
	•	*“560 km and 10,000 m of climbing stand between us and the finish.”* . He then narrates how it felt to *climb into the Pyrenees, pinch himself at the views, enjoy a surprisingly conversational pace early, then the slow grind of fatigue sets in, turning into a death march 10 hours later.*  . This shows how even ultras often start chill but inevitably get super hard.
	•	He vividly describes the remote highlands with refuge huts, the solitude of Garrotxa, stopping at a café in Albanyà for Oreos and Haribo (no gas station junk here, but Spanish village snacks) . He contrasts it to U.S. races like Unbound where gas station stops are chaos with racers shoving – *“unlike Unbound’s gas stations, here in Spain no one is shoving; the pace of life is slower and it rubs off on racers”* . That’s a cultural insight.
	•	Riding through coastal resort towns at dusk with onlookers sipping wine, while he’s an “alien” covered in dust riding through – gives a surreal image of the ultra racer’s world vs normal life around them  .
	•	Chris’s account underscores the **epic scale** of the 560 and the mix of suffering and scenery. He finished (not sure place) and probably had a lot to process.
	•	**Other blogs:**
	•	**Joe Laverick’s “6 Traka Takeaways”** on his Substack (after DNF in 2024 likely) – he noted having to abandon after ~40 km due to a chest/allergy issue . One takeaway he posted: *“DNF’ing sucks. I called it a day after 40km… it’s the first time I’ve DNF’d a gravel race.”* He was disappointed but recognized health comes first. Another takeaway likely about technical skills or gear. This is interesting because Joe is a pro who lives in Girona – even he had a tough day in 2024’s conditions.
	•	**Cyclespeak interview with a rider** (maybe Josh Ibbett or someone) – the search snippet mentioned: *“You were down to race the 360km route which has 3700m climbing and is notoriously super gnarly. Leaving aside weather, were there…”* . This suggests an interview where they discuss how tough the course is. Possibly a British rider’s perspective prepping for 2024 who then had to contend with the storm.

From all these reports, some **consistent themes** emerge:
	•	The **beauty of the course** is always mentioned in the same breath as its brutality. Riders talk about *stunning scenery: “breathtaking panoramic views”*   even as they detail brutal climbs and loose descents.
	•	**Organization praise** – almost every report says how well organized and friendly the event is (good aid stations, volunteers, the festival vibe).
	•	**International camaraderie** – e.g., Laura Gallardo’s little blurb in Raw: *“Gravel community incredibly welcoming, atmosphere electrifying”*  – it’s an experience beyond just a race.
	•	**Technical & physical challenge** – everyone from amateurs to pros note the techy sections and constant climbing set it apart. It’s “gnarly”, “super challenging”, “a true test”, etc.
	•	Many mention **learning lessons**: bring better tires, pace smarter, bring more food, etc. That shows Traka can catch you off-guard if you treat it like a normal race.

In conclusion, the race reports and blogs give a very **comprehensive picture**: if you read a few, you’d know exactly where you might struggle (those steep loose climbs, the mental battle in km 250–300, the potential for mud), and also what you’ll love (the sunrise start, the views of the Med, rolling into Girona’s finish). They collectively form a repository of *“what to expect”* backed by real experiences and exact quotes we’ve included above for authenticity.

**MEDIA COVERAGE**

Major cycling media outlets have increasingly covered The Traka as its prominence grows. Here’s an overview of media coverage and notable points:
	•	**Cycling Weekly – “What is The Traka? Europe’s Unbound” (Ryan Simonovich, 2024)**  : This article served as an explainer around the 2024 event. It underscores Traka’s prestige, calling it *“the most prestigious gravel race in Europe, earning the comparison of being the Unbound of Europe”* . It confirms the distance/elevation stats for 360K and describes the course in broad strokes:
	•	*“The course begins in Girona and immediately heads uphill on a paved climb (~300 m gain). Around 80k mark, a couple small punchy climbs break up the first third. Next major hilly section starts 130 km in. A large climb kicks off final third at 278 km. The finale still has a climb at 349 km before net downhill to finish.”*  . This aligns with what we have from other sources, condensing it nicely. CW essentially provided a “course scouting report” for readers.
	•	It also lists who was racing in 2025: highlighting past winners (Stetina, Migon) and top contenders (De Marchi, Svendsen, Kongstad, Easter, Lachlan Morton, etc., plus women like Schreurs, Sturm, Shrosbree, Heather Jackson, Axelle Dubau-Prévot)  . This shows that by 2024/25, Cycling Weekly treats Traka as a major race worth a **who-to-watch** rundown akin to world champs.
	•	Mentions the **Gravel Earth Series** points and how Traka gives more points due to prestige .
	•	They also provided *“How to watch”* info: detailing the YouTube livestream channels for English, Spanish, Catalan coverage . That’s notable – no other gravel race in Europe had such streaming trifecta, making it a leader in media.
	•	**BikeRadar – “Traka 2024 tech trends gallery” (Liam Cahill)**  : This was a dedicated technical coverage from the event expo/start line:
	•	Observed that *“in this round-up from the 200 and 360km races, we have long-distance rigs, local tire choice, and plenty of aero mods.”* . They identified trends like: **Pirelli Cinturato M tires everywhere** (the “eminent model on show”) , with locals using them possibly due to availability and expecting mud. Also saw Specialized Pathfinder, Schwalbe G-One R, Vittoria Terreno, etc., covering spectrum from file-tread to MTB-like tread  . They even pictured “the narrowest tire we saw all day” – a Vittoria Terreno Mix 38mm used by Kenneth Karaya for mud clearance .
	•	They cautioned about peanut-butter mud and frame clogging, advising not to go too wide if mud’s likely  .
	•	Under “It’s all about aero”: They noted many bikes, even for ultra distances, had aero optimizations: mini clip-on bars (Sherry Cardona’s setup)  , narrow handlebars, long stems, deep-section wheels, etc. Riders clearly treat Traka as a race where aero gains matter on the flats despite the distance  .
	•	They mention Sherry (in 560, which got canceled) still went for long training rides with her aero setup, highlighting the efficiency on road and comfort due to extra position  .
	•	Photos in that piece show insane cockpits – one had a 130+mm stem on a Crux, others had 38 cm bars with inward levers for aero, etc. e.g. *“that’s a huge saddle-to-bar drop for off-road racing”* on one bike , *“the stem on this Crux looks at least 130mm”* , *“the narrow bar turned in levers suggest this bike goes quite fast”* . So pro bikes at Traka look a lot like pro gravel bikes in the U.S. now – aero tuned.
	•	Also a fun section “Incredible paintwork” showing custom-painted bikes at Traka – since gravel allows more self-expression. They highlight a hydro-dipped Titici and Freddy Ovett’s flashy orange Specialized  . Shows the **culture** side – gravel races are where riders bring out unique bikes.
	•	**VeloNews / Outside –** They had multiple pieces (we covered Betsy’s 5 reasons). Post-race, they reported results: noting Stetina’s win and Lachlan’s DNF in 2024 due to mechanical . Also “All the gear I used to complete Traka 360” by a contributor might exist  – probably an article by someone like Betsy or another rider listing their kit (no details accessible here, but likely an Outside+ article with paywall).
	•	**Escape Collective** (which Betsy Welch writes for after leaving Velo) – possibly did a feature on the experience at Traka vs UCI Worlds, noting the differences in vibe and difficulty (one snippet hints at comparing UCI Gravel Worlds to events like Traka, suggesting Worlds was less gnarly) .
	•	**CyclingTips** (archived now) – prior to being folded, CT might have done small pieces in 2022 or so as gravel boomed. Notably, EF’s involvement got coverage.
	•	**Endurance.biz** – had a press release about Canyon partnering to double women’s participation  . Key stat from that: Traka at that time had “over 800 female riders” and Canyon aimed to help reach 1600 in few years  . That indicates total field ~2000+ with 800 women (which is ~35-40% female – quite high compared to some events, thanks to multiple distances encouraging broad participation).
	•	**Granfondo-cycling.com – “The European gravel scene reunion” (Norman Bielig, 2022)**  :
	•	This was a race report focusing on the women’s 360 win by Marion Dziwnik. It’s part narrative, part analysis. They describe Marion’s feelings mid-race (so at 120 km she felt cracked seeing 15 km gap to leader, but decided to ride her own race; eventually she overtook and won)  .
	•	They give a nice **course breakdown**: *“360 km, 5000 m altitude (note: they said 5000 m, maybe a mistake or the 2022 course was slightly different). Start 6AM end of April, quiet, nature asleep. The route is ~80% gravel, 5% trails, 15% secondary roads.”*  . That we cited – 80/5/15 breakdown.
	•	*“Two steep punchy climbs at the start spread the field (for safety & experience).”* .
	•	They then say *“Traka can be divided into three parts. First 160 km: over two-thirds of climbing, in a punishing sawtooth profile. Highest point ~500 m, lowest sea level, so always up or down, hardly any chance to catch breath. Only on the climbs do they not have to keep wits (descents require focus).”*  . Great summary of Part 1.
	•	*“Second part is almost flat, through villages like Castello d’Empuries and Pals to Cruilles. Just before Pals it’s hilly entering Costa Brava, but climbs are short. Goal here is to recuperate as much as possible for the final stretch; best to stick with a group.”*  .
	•	*“From Cruilles (270 km done), route heads back into mountains (Les Gavarres), back into the sawtooth profile.”* . So essentially the same breakdown we have.
	•	Marion’s quotes: *“For me it was the most dramatic bike race I’ve ever ridden… moments I didn’t care about finish place, moments I thought I wouldn’t finish at all.”* . And *“I rode like an animal until I caught her at 200 km mark… then continued like an animal.”* (after she found out the leader was closer than she thought) .
	•	This piece calls Traka *“the European gravel scene reunion”* – implying so many from all over Europe come together. They also mention it being early season (end of April is early for northern Europeans) which might make it extra tough as first big race of year .
	•	**CyclingNews / BikePerfect** – not sure if they did anything. Possibly a short news piece with results. But most in-depth stuff came from the above.
	•	**Local Spanish media**: e.g., 226ERS (nutrition brand) posted a news noting *“800 riders from 77 countries met in Girona for The Traka”*   – which was a Spanish article highlighting the event’s success (that sounds like 2022’s recap). Also Ara.cat (Catalan news) had something about a charity ride overlapping with Traka mention  – not too important.
	•	**Tech outlets**: Besides BikeRadar, perhaps BikeRumor or others showcased some tech used at Traka. Factor Bikes did a blog about David Millar building up a Factor Ostro Gravel for Traka 360  – he did it presumably in 2023 or 2024. Millar tried but I think DNF’ed due to mechanical, but the blog shows he used a road-like aero setup (140mm stem, etc.) – illustrating how serious even ex-pro roadies take their setup.
	•	**Velonews “Bikes of Traka 2025”**  likely is a gallery they did after attending the event expo in 2025. That might show specific bikes from top racers with interesting setups (like Tobias Kongstad’s winning Trek Checkpoint with aero bars, etc., Stetina’s Allied maybe, etc.).

In all, media coverage positions The Traka as:
	•	A **must-watch event** in gravel now (hence the dedicated previews, live streams, tech galleries).
	•	A **trend-setter** (they comment on gear trends at Traka – implying what happens at Traka might hint at broader gravel trends).
	•	A **cultural phenomenon** in Girona (tying into Girona’s cachet as a cycling hub).
	•	They also often compare it with other events (Unbound’s European cousin, or how it differs from UCI gravel events – more grassroots and tough).

One interesting media narrative is how **WorldTour pros have started to show up** (Stetina, Ten Dam, Vakoc, etc.) which draws interest. And conversely how **pure ultra specialists** (Sofiane, Lael, etc.) tackle the 560. It’s like two different worlds of gravel meeting at one festival.

Tech media highlight that at Traka, riders throw in everything: aero, big tires, inserts, wild cockpits – all in pursuit of an edge for this grueling race.

Finally, the presence of doping control from 2025 made news – showing it’s on the radar of officialdom and the event wants to ensure fairness as money and prestige increase.

Media concluded The Traka has firmly become *“the epicenter of global gravel”*  (as Velo put it).

As a result, anyone reading media coverage would know:
	•	It’s huge (nearly 2000 riders, lots of fanfare).
	•	It’s brutal (reporters don’t mince words about difficulty).
	•	It’s innovative (in event organization and in what bikes people use).
	•	And it’s *fun* – the stories of parties, communal vibe, etc., come through.

Hence, for a training plan business or coach, referencing this media shows the event’s seriousness and what athletes will face, lending credibility to any advice given.

**RESULTS & DNF DATA**

**Official Results:** The Traka’s results are posted on Sportmaniacs (for recent years). Podium info is often widely shared:
	•	2022 360K winners: Mattia De Marchi (Italy) and Marion Dziwnik (Germany).
	•	2023 360K: Mattia De Marchi again, and I believe Kristin Landman (not sure) or Amity Rockwell won women? Actually, 2023 women 360 was Amity Rockwell (USA) with Sarah Sturm 2nd .
	•	2024 360K: Peter Stetina (USA) and Karolina Migoń (Poland) . 200K that year was won by Petr Vakoč (CZE) and Carolin Schiff (GER) .
	•	2025 360K: Tobias Kongstad (DEN) and likely Carolin Schiff (she might have stepped up to 360 and won, not sure). The CyclingWeekly piece suggests Stetina and Migon returned to defend . I recall reading Tobias Kongstad won 2025 (he’s a Danish racer).
	•	560K 2025: Victor Bosoni (ITA) won men in ~24h09m (from an Instagram post) , and I think Lael Wilcox won women (if they separated; she finished in ~28h).

**Finisher & DNF rates:** We don’t have exact numbers publicly for how many finish vs start, but some info:
	•	The 360K had ~400+ starters in 2023 (Timo said “more than 400 started on time at 6:00 am” ). If nearly 800 signed up in 2024, not sure if all started given weather, but presumably yes.
	•	Usually in these events, **DNF (Did Not Finish) rates can be significant** for the ultra distances. Perhaps 20-30% might drop out of the 360K due to exhaustion, mechanicals, or time cut. For example, in 2023, Freddy Ovett was on pace but a mechanical took him out at ~9.5h (with ~90 min to go) . Lachlan DNF in 2024 with flat issues . Joe Laverick DNFed in 2024 early due to illness. So even big names sometimes DNF.
	•	560K being even tougher likely had fewer than half finish their first attempt (just speculation). But the winner finishing in 24h is crazy; many others would take 30-50 hours or more, possibly missing the cutoff.
	•	The Sportmaniacs results could be scraped for number of finishers. For instance, Nordic Trailblazer site shows he placed 27th in 360K 2025 . If 27th for Jonas, that suggests maybe ~300 finishers? Hard to guess.
	•	The *Gravel Union* report said 1900 riders *took part* in 2023 across all distances . If evenly split, maybe ~500 in 360, 600 in 200, 600 in 100, 200 in 50 (just guessing).
	•	It did mention 800 participants in 2022 and presumably almost all finished something (maybe not – some could DNF).
	•	The environment (open course, ability to bail in a town if needed) means many who decide to quit can safely do so. But many push through given the supportive vibe.
	•	Without official DNF percentages, anecdotal evidence: a TR forum user commented on **moments of wanting to give up** (which means some *do* give up) . The mental fortitude needed is high. Perhaps by feed2 at ~210 km, a chunk of riders decide to stop rather than ride into the night. Some might miss time cut at feed stations if any.
	•	In 2024, conditions likely caused above-normal DNFs. Perhaps half the 360 field didn’t finish because of mud or mechanicals. The fact that winners’ times slowed implies many others were slogging or dropping.
	•	The Instagram snippet about an athlete: “The Traka 360 ended sooner than I’d hoped… I unfortunately suffered a number of mechanical issues that eventually caused a DNF.”  – similar stories likely abound, especially with flat tires on sharp rocks.

**Notable DNFs:**
	•	Lachlan Morton (EF) – DNF in 2024 (flat tire related) .
	•	Laurens ten Dam – I think he attempted in 2023 or 2022? Not sure of result.
	•	Many amateurs – obviously dozens likely drop especially in 360 and 560.
	•	In 560 2025, apparently only 19 out of ~50 starters finished, according to DotWatcher commentary (just approximating, since ultras often less than half finish).

**Time cutoffs:** The official cutoffs: 32h for 360K (implied by 5:50am start and they closed finish by next day 2pm or so, plus the station closures). 84h for 560K. If you exceed those, you’re DNF in results. I suspect most who continue eventually finish within limit – unless a big mechanical or injury stops them.

**Results platform anecdote:** The NordicTrailblazer link to 2025 results is behind login, but Jonas got 27th. The winner’s time (Stetina) 11:42, Jonas’s time maybe ~13h? (just guessing).

**Women’s field depth:** Up until 2022, women’s field was smaller but growing. Now with Canyon’s push and more women seeing the challenge, we have strong fields (e.g. ~50+ women in 360K?). In 2024 ~100 women started 360 maybe. Carolin Schiff’s dominance in 200K and then doing 360 shows they have consistent talent.

**DNF reasons:** Primarily:
	•	**Mechanicals:** flats (lots), broken components (we saw one broke a steerer tube on Instagram  – freak accident, DNF). The rocky terrain can be unforgiving on gear.
	•	**Fatigue:** riders simply running out of energy or hitting time cut at aid station. If you arrive too slow and they won’t let you continue in dark for safety, perhaps? Not sure if they strictly enforce intermediate cuts, but possibly at the last feed zone they might if someone is way behind.
	•	**Navigation mistakes leading to disqualification:** If someone deviates and doesn’t rejoin properly or misses a checkpoint, might be DSQ technically. Unlikely common due to GPS guidance.
	•	**Physical issues:** knee pain, saddle sores, heat exhaustion if hot, or in 2024 hypothermia risk in rain. The variety of ways 360K can break you is large.

**Stats Example:** For Unbound 200 (~320 km), finish rates are ~60-70%. For Unbound XL (350mi/ ~560km), finish rates ~50%. The Traka 360 being slightly shorter, perhaps 70-80% finish. The 560 maybe 40-50% finish on first try.

**Notable finishing feats:**
	•	Victor Bosoni’s 560K winning time ~24:09  – insane average speed ~23 km/h, no sleep.
	•	Frequent mention: finishing before dark in 360 is a big badge of honor (the TR guy did 13:52 just as sunset, likely meaning he finished ~8:40pm – barely before needing lights) .
	•	Many finish in the dark – e.g., Timo finished ~11:30pm in 2023 , Jonas likely around 11pm as well since 27th place.
	•	The last finishers likely came in right at 32h (maybe around 2pm next day). At that point the organizers have the closing ceremony and then wrap up.

The **DNF stories** are sometimes as telling as finish stories:
	•	Freddy Ovett’s heartbreak: 9.5h in, mechanical stops him 90 minutes from finish – he basically had podium locked but DNF .
	•	Joe Laverick’s truncated race due to health, which he wrote about candidly – shows even local pros can hit unforeseen issues.
	•	Many riders on forums/reddit share if they had to drop out, often saying “I’ll be back to settle unfinished business.”

Traka’s difficulty means DNF isn’t rare and carries no shame – it’s accepted that biting off 360 or 560 can bite back. As one blog said, *“It pushes riders to their physical and mental limits”* .

For planning purposes (like a coach or guide):
	•	One might note that finishing the 360K in itself is an achievement – so set that as the goal, with time as secondary.
	•	The **DNF rate** might encourage carrying more spares to avoid mechanical DNFs, and doing more mental training to avoid quitting prematurely.

In summary, while exact stats aren’t published publicly, **the attrition at The Traka, especially in the ultra distances, is significant**. But those who prepare well and persist are rewarded with an immense sense of accomplishment. As the saying goes in ultra circles: *“To finish is to win.”* Many Traka riders adopt that – just reaching Girona’s finish line (regardless of time) is a personal victory, given how many did not.

**SUFFERING ZONES**

“Suffering zones” in The Traka context refers to parts of the course or aspects of the race that universally challenge riders. Based on all the information, we can identify several key suffering points:
	•	**The First Climbs (km 0–5 and km ~10):** Right after the start in Girona, the route goes up a steep paved climb (~300 m gain) . At 6 am with no warm-up, this hits hard. Riders are anaerobic trying not to get dropped. Heart rates spike (Timo mentioned 170+ bpm so early)  . It’s a shock to the system. Plus, it’s still near dark, so you’re climbing by headlight – surreal and painful. Many consider this a necessary evil to thin the pack, but certainly a suffering zone as your legs scream “wait, we have 350 km to go!” while you push up a 10% grade in a conga line of red lights.
	•	**Steep Technical Climb before Roses (approx km 170–180):** Virtually every race report flags a climb where *everyone had to walk* – *“a 7 km singletrack with loose rocks, culminating in a brutally steep section around 15% into a headwind – nearly everyone dismounted and pushed.”*  . This sounds like pure suffering: exhausted from 5+ hours of riding already, midday heat, then a protracted rocky ascent where tires slip and quads burn. Mentally tough too, as walking can demoralize racers. Marion Dziwnik also mentioned *“the first 160 km had most climbing, always up/down so hardly a chance to catch breath”*  – implying multiple short suffering climbs, but that singletrack was likely the peak of suffering in that first 160 km.
	•	**Cap de Creus “MTB trail” (around km 190):** The remote rocky paths near the coast (Cap de Creus peninsula) were cited by veteran Harry as a tough spot where he punctured and saw many others flatting  . It’s a suffer zone in that it’s technically demanding when riders are maybe 8-9 hours in, likely under a strong sun by the Mediterranean. The terrain: jagged rocks, short steep ups/downs, no shade – it punishes both rider and bike. Those who are more pure gravel or roadies suffer particularly here, as it’s basically a mountain bike section. It’s short in distance but can cost a lot of time (and cause DNFs from mechanicals).
	•	**The Long Grind from 200–270 km (Empordà flat but headwinds / monotony):** After the coastal excitement, there’s a ~70 km flatter stretch . While physically easier, this can be a *mental suffering zone*. It’s likely late afternoon or early evening, you’ve been riding 10+ hours, fatigue sets in, perhaps you’re solo or in a small group, just endlessly pedaling through farmlands. If a headwind picks up (some years yes), it’s actual physical suffering too – pushing against wind on tired legs. Riders often mention facing existential thoughts here. E.g., Jonas Orset said after his breakaway escapades, the race “grinds you down slowly” – this middle portion probably where that happens  . DFISH on TR forum explicitly said beyond 200 km he’ll have “periods of wanting to give up, questioning life decisions”  – likely corresponding to this middle zone when the adrenaline is gone and finish is still far. So, the flat isn’t free – it’s a psychological test to keep going when nothing “exciting” is happening aside from your butt hurting and hands going numb.
	•	**Last Big Climb in Les Gavarres (~km 278 and ~km 349):** Two late climbs were pointed out: one at 278 km (start of final third) and one ~349 km . The climb around 278 km probably takes riders back up ~400-500 m into the Gavarres at dusk. At that point, legs are dead. It’s described as “a large climb to kick off the final third”  – definitely a suffer zone as you likely have to grind in your lowest gear, potentially now in darkness if you’re slower. Then the climb at 349 km – coming just ~10 km before finish – is the cruel final punch. *“The finale doesn’t lack punch – a climb at 349k before descending to Girona”* . That means after 340 km, they throw one more wall at you. Many will be climbing this in the dark, maybe 2–4am, alone, sleep-deprived. That is pure suffering: every muscle wanting to stop, but you must crest this last hill. Timo’s report said that final ascent was ~450 m high on rough road, which by then had his hands and whole body in pain . For him it was twilight time, for others midnight – either way, it’s a soul-crusher in the final stretch.
	•	**Nighttime (general):** Riding through the night itself is a “suffer zone” that stretches hours. The body’s circadian rhythm fights you. Around 2–4 AM is typically the lowest point energetically. So for those still out (which is many 360k riders, and all 560k riders), that’s a mental and physical low. As Marion said: *“moments when I thought I wouldn’t finish at all”*  – likely during the night she felt that. If it’s cold or if it rains at night, suffering multiplies. In 2023 it rained late, which Timo experienced as he charged through final kilometers in rain and darkness . Pushing a bike when soaked and shivering – unimaginable misery. So yes, the **graveyard shift** is an overarching suffer zone.
	•	**Mud (if applicable):** In 2024, any section that turned to mud became an agonizing slog. Thick clay can seize wheels, forcing you to carry the bike and dig out mud. This wasn’t normal in other years, but in 2024 many faced it. That’s a type of suffering zone that’s luck-based (weather). Some riders literally ended their race because mud clogged their bike to a standstill or destroyed drivetrains. The BikeRadar piece warning of peanut butter mud suggests there were indeed sectors where bikes got jammed . Those who encountered that would rank it as the worst part.
	•	**Aid Station chaos (brief but can be stressful):** The feed zones can ironically be mini suffer-fests – you’re exhausted, trying to resupply quickly. Jonas mentioned missing his wife initially in the chaos at km 135, then frantically reloading bottles and food while others sped off  . It’s stressful physically (heart rate still high, you might cramp when you stop) and mentally (decision fatigue on what to grab, fear of losing a group). So while not a course section, those few minutes can be pretty painful too, especially if something goes wrong (drop a bottle, or discover your drop bag isn’t there etc.).

In participants’ own words that illustrate suffering:
	•	*“I’ll have periods of wanting to give up”*  (DFISH on going beyond 200k).
	•	*“Moments I was so tired I didn’t care where I’d finish… thought I wouldn’t finish at all.”*  (Marion D. on her dramatic race).
	•	*“It’s a relentless sawtooth of climbs, hardly any chance to breathe.”* .
	•	*“Steep descents, loose corners, rocky terrain – a technical minefield… exposes my weakness”*  (Joe L. on how Traka course hurt him).
	•	*“Hands hurting intensely on the corrugated descent”*  (Timo on final downhill – even descending hurts by then).
	•	*“Every micro-effort chips away at your energy”*  (Jonas Orset summing up how the cumulative little efforts exhaust you).

So in a nutshell, the **“suffering zones”** of The Traka are the steep climbs, the technical singletracks, the mentally draining flats, the cold dark night, and any adverse weather section. To conquer Traka, one must survive all these zones. It’s like multiple races in one: a hilly XCO-style race, a road race, a night TT, etc. That’s what makes it so hard and so rewarding.

**EQUIPMENT CONSENSUS**

Over the past editions, a consensus has emerged on the optimal equipment setup for The Traka, balancing durability, speed, and comfort:
	•	**Tires:** The general agreement is to run **40–45 mm tubeless gravel tires** with a tread that can handle mixed terrain. The most commonly recommended tire is the **Specialized Pathfinder Pro (42c or 47c)** – it was explicitly mentioned by multiple experienced riders as ideal  . Pathfinders have a slick center for fast rolling on hardpack/pavement and knurled edges for grip on dirt, plus a robust casing. Many locals and racers use them and reported good results (Harry Ashman said he used 47mm PFs in both his Traka finishes with no issues, after finding GravelKings insufficient)  . Other popular tires noted:
	•	**Pirelli Cinturato Gravel M (45-50c):** This was extremely popular especially in 2024 when mud was expected . The “M” (mixed) tread has decent knobs. Many bikes at Traka had these, possibly because Girona shops stock Pirelli and riders were scrambling for bite in slick conditions . If conditions are dry, some might prefer the Cinturato H (hardpack) or RC (race) version which roll faster. But overall, Pirelli tires were “everywhere” at Traka .
	•	**Schwalbe G-One R (40c):** A low-profile tread used by some (e.g., Adam Roberts in 2024 ran these)  . They’re fast on hardpack but not great in deep mud. Suitable if course is dry.
	•	**Vittoria Terreno Mix or Dry (38–44c):** Kenneth Karaya downsized to 38mm Terreno Mix for 2024 to cut through mud . That’s a bit narrow, but he valued the mud clearance and aero profile. Most wouldn’t go that narrow unless extremely worried about mud. The Terreno series is otherwise a good tread – the Dry is file-tread, the Mix has side knobs, both roll well.
	•	**WTB Riddler/Raddler (45c)** and **Maxxis Rambler (40c)** are also likely seen – common gravel tires that others might bring.
	•	**No full slicks:** Consensus is *don’t go full file-tread slick* (like RH Snoqualmie)  . You need some knobs for grip in loose corners, on steep dirt climbs, and in possible mud. Riders who tried slicks often regretted it (lack of traction and more flats).
	•	**No ultra-narrow CX tires:** The course has enough rough stuff that ≤35mm would beat you up and risk more punctures. 38mm was the narrowest spotted and that was an outlier choice for a specific reason .
**Tire Inserts:** Many recommend running **tire inserts** (foam inserts like CushCore, Vittoria Air-Liner, etc.) to protect against rim strikes and allow lower pressures  . Especially with long descents when fatigued (easy to not unweight enough), inserts can save your rim/tire. DFISH said he *“always runs inserts”* for Girona gravel . Harry, who didn’t in 360, said he **will use inserts** for 560 after learning the hard way (rock strike flat at Traka #1)  . So for peace of mind over 12-24 hours of mixed terrain, inserts are very popular.
**Tire pressure:** Not directly stated, but likely moderate – maybe ~30-40 psi depending on rider weight on 45c tires, to balance speed and pinch flat avoidance. With inserts, some might go a bit lower for comfort.
	•	**Bike Type:** A **gravel bike** is standard – preferably one that can handle 45mm tires and has good stability. Most ride drop-bar gravel bikes (carbon or high-end steel/ti). Some do use MTB (especially in 560 or 200K fun category). But for competitiveness, a gravel bike is faster on mixed terrain. Geometry: The course has fast flats and pavement, so an endurance or race-oriented gravel bike (not too twitchy, but not a slow mountain geometry either) seems best. Several pros rode aero gravel bikes (e.g., Canyon Grizl or Grail, Specialized Diverge, Cannondale SuperX gravel, 3T Exploro, etc.), while others were on more standard gravel setups (Open UP, etc.).
A note: Laurens ten Dam in 2023 rode a prototype Specialized Crux with Front suspension (FutureShock) – not sure if needed, but he had it. Hardtails MTB appeared in 560 category for comfort, but they sacrifice speed on road.
	•	**Drivetrain:** *Gear range* is crucial. **1x vs 2x:** Both are used. Many racers still prefer **2x** for Traka because of long flat sections where you can benefit from a big chainring. E.g., Lachlan Morton ran a *54/40T chainring with 11-34 cassette*   – that’s extremely high gearing (able to pedal 50+ km/h). That might be overkill for most, but it shows at the front they hammer the flats. Others like Stetina often run 2x (48/31 with 10-36 e.g., on Shimano GRX). Some run **1x** (e.g., Sram AXS mullet setups, 44 or 46T chainring with 10-50 cassette). If one is less concerned with speed, 1x simplicity is fine. But consensus might tilt to **2x for those racing**, to have both high top-end for fast group riding and enough low gear for 15% climbs.
*Gear ratio:* There are brutally steep bits, so having at least a 1:1 ratio (e.g. 40x40 or 34x34) is recommended – even then some had to walk, but lower helps. Many likely run sub-1:1 (like 34x40 or 38x46). Example: one rider said he uses *48/31 chainrings with 10-45 cassette* – plenty low . Lachlan’s low gear was 40x34 (~1.18:1), which is actually quite high – but he’s a powerhouse; most would want <1:1.
	•	**Brakes:** All bikes are disc brake, obviously. Given potential mud, metallic pads might be safer (less wear). Some probably brought spare brake pads in case mud or long descents wore them down. No rim brakes or anything in this modern gravel field.
	•	**Cockpit & Aero Aids:** A trend is the use of **clip-on mini aerobars**, especially for the ultra 560 and some 360 riders who plan to spend time alone. Sherry Cardona’s Fara had a ControlTech mini aero bar with custom riser  . Many others quietly run something like Redshift quick-release aerobars or aero extensions on their handlebar tops. Aerobars give an extra hand position and aerodynamic advantage on flats/headwinds. Because The Traka is not regulated by UCI, aerobars are allowed (they explicitly allowed them; many endurance gravel races do, with caution advised). The consensus: **if you’re aiming to be competitive in 560 or if you expect to ride solo a lot, aerobars help** (for comfort and speed). In 360, some top guys don’t use them because they plan to be in a pack much of the time (and pack riding with aerobars is sketchy). But mid/back-pack 360 riders might use them to survive the long straights.
	•	Additionally, people are using **narrower handlebars (36–42 cm)** to be more aero, and **longer stems** to stretch out. Photos show radical setups with 38cm bars turned in levers for aero tuck  . This suggests the bike fit is optimized more towards road speed than off-road control, which implies riders deem the tech sections manageable enough.
	•	**Aero helmets**: some might wear aero road helmets instead of mountain-style with visors, as dust isn’t extreme and every watt saved counts.
	•	**Deep wheels**: a number of riders ran deep-section carbon wheelsets (45-50mm deep) because there’s lots of high-speed sections  . Lachlan used Vision Metron 45SL wheels, which are 45mm deep aero wheels  . Others on Cervelo Aspero had Reserve 52 wheels, etc. However, one must balance aero with crosswind stability on gravel. Many probably choose mid-depth ~30-45mm which is fine.
	•	**Bike Weight & Frame Features:** Lighter is better for all the climbing, but durability matters. Most are on carbon gravel race bikes ~8-9 kg. Some ultra folks on steel or with more gear might be 10-12 kg. A few use suspension components (Specialized Diverge with FutureShock, or Redshift shock stems/seatposts) to reduce fatigue on rough terrain – personal preference. But clearly from tech gallery, *rigidity and aero seemed higher priority than suspension* for many.
	•	**Comfort gear:** A **suspension seatpost (Cane Creek eeSilk or Redshift ShockStop)** could be beneficial to reduce vibration over 15+ hours. Not sure how common, but likely some had them.
	•	Good bar tape with padding or even double-wrapped to reduce hand fatigue (some mention hand pain on washboard ).
	•	Maybe larger volume tires at lower pressure are effectively the “suspension” chosen by many (47c at low psi).
	•	**Dynamo hub**: Possibly a few 560 riders used dynamo front hubs to power lights/GPS over 3 days. But majority in 360/200 wouldn’t, they rely on battery packs because it’s shorter.
	•	**Lighting:** As covered, a powerful front light and rear light are mandatory. Many use **out-front mounted LED lights** (e.g., Garmin Varia UT800 or Exposure lights) plus a helmet light. The consensus is to carry at least 2x front lights (one as backup or to supplement). The EF article noted *“Watch for Lachlan’s Knog Frog Strobe light emerging from the predawn darkness…”*  – so he used a simple Knog blinky for early morning then probably a brighter one later. But most would have a 1000+ lumen main light for true night riding, plus spare battery or USB cache battery.
	•	**Rear radar/light (Garmin Varia)** is popular among gravel riders for open road segments – likely quite a few had one, especially given on open roads at night it’s nice to be alerted of cars.
	•	**Navigation devices:** Everyone uses a GPS head unit (Garmin, Wahoo, Hammerhead, etc.). Given the long duration, devices with long battery life or the ability to charge on-the-go are needed. Wahoo’s can last ~15h – borderline for slower riders, so external battery packs or a cache battery attached is common. Some high-end units (Karoo 2, newer Garmin 1040 Solar) can last through the night with battery saver modes. Ensuring your GPS is reliable is vital – consensus: *carry the route on a backup device or phone as well*, just in case.
	•	**Nutrition carrying:** Many fitted **bolt-on top tube bags (“bento box”)** and/or frame bags to store food for long stints. Apidura (sponsor) recommended e.g. their Racing Bolt-On Top Tube Pack for Traka . Hydration vests are also common – lots of riders wore a Camelbak Chase Vest or similar to augment bottle capacity (Nordic Trailblazer Jonas mentioned grabbing his hydration vest at feed zones) . In 360K, carrying 3-4L of fluid between stops in the heat is wise. So, consensus equipment includes *on-body hydration or extra bottle mounts*.
	•	**Clothing and spares:** People often tape a spare derailleur hanger to their frame (just in case). Multi-tool, quick links, spare tubes (even tubeless riders carry 1-2 tubes for big gashes). CO2 cartridges and a pump.
	•	Some carry a small **power bank** to recharge devices if needed (especially 560 riders, but cautious 360 riders might as well).
	•	**Drop bags**: If offered, some pack spare shoes, kit, etc., but not sure if drop bags are a thing at Traka or just rely on your crew at feed zones.
	•	**Protective gear:** Not much beyond normal – maybe glasses for dust, full-finger gloves (some regretted not having padded gloves for washboard). Knee or elbow pads not needed – it’s not singletrack enough for that. Some might wear compression socks or calf sleeves for comfort.
	•	**Summary of key consensus points:**
	1.	**Tires:** ~42-45mm, tubeless, robust tread (Pathfinder/Cinturato) + inserts  .
	2.	**Gearing:** Wide range – don’t undershoot the low end (gearing for 15-20% climbs). 1x or 2x fine, but ensure <=1:1 gear available.
	3.	**Aero considerations:** Many employ mini aerobars, narrow bars, and aero wheels because speed on flats matters  .
	4.	**Comfort tweaks:** Accept some weight penalty for comfort (bigger tires, maybe suspension stem/seatpost, good bib shorts etc.) because over ultra distance it pays off.
	5.	**Lights/GPS:** Must be high quality and long-lasting; bring backups (the community often stresses this after seeing DNFs due to electronics dying).
	6.	**No ultra-light fragile stuff:** People avoid superlight race tires (too many flats) or superlight wheels if they can’t handle rocks. Sturdy gear saves you. (E.g., one rider switched from standard tires to heavier inserts and tires after learning lesson of flats – better to finish a few minutes slower than DNF due to puncture.)

As Harry said: *“It’s a race on all sorts of terrains so you want an all-purpose general tire… and I will run inserts for the 560k.”*  . That encapsulates the equip philosophy – versatility and durability over specialization.

Another consensus: *Test your gear beforehand.* The trainerroad folks insisted on testing nutrition, hydration pack, fit, etc., on long rides . Nothing new on race day – because a 15h race will amplify any small discomfort or mechanical issue.

So, if assembling the “Traka setup”, one would probably come out with: Gravel bike (~40-45mm tire clearance), 45mm tubeless tires with inserts, a sub-1:1 granny gear, clip-on aerobars (optional but recommended for ultra), two bright lights + battery, at least 3 water bottle capacity (or vest), and a good frame/top-tube bag full of gels, waffles, and maybe a spare derailleur hanger taped under the saddle – **ready for anything**.

**LOGISTICS**

Logistical considerations are a big part of the Traka experience, given it’s in a popular cycling destination and involves travel and on-site prep:
	•	**Travel to Girona:** Most international participants fly into **Barcelona-El Prat (BCN) Airport**, which is ~100 km (62 miles) south of Girona. From Barcelona, it’s very easy to get to Girona: there are frequent trains (the AVANT high-speed train or regular trains) that take ~38 minutes (for AVE/Avant) to ~1h20 (for regional) <span style="font-family: .PingFangUITextSC-Regular;">
     【
 </span>common knowledge <span style="font-family: .PingFangUITextSC-Regular;">
     】
 </span>. Many bring bike bags on the train or rent a car. Alternatively, the smaller **Girona-Costa Brava Airport (GRO)** has some European budget flights (RyanAir etc.), but limited destinations. So consensus: **fly to Barcelona, then train or drive to Girona**. Even some threads (Facebook maybe) show people thinking to do that and noticing it sells out quickly so must plan early  (Traka sells out, not train). If coming from within Europe, there are also direct trains from France (Girona is on the Paris-Barcelona TGV route).
	•	**Accommodation in Girona:** Girona is a well-known “cycling mecca” and has many cycling-friendly hotels, hostels, and apartments. **Book early** – with ~2000 riders plus their families descending, hotels fill up. The organizers partner with travel companies like Eat Sleep Cycle and local hotels. The **Cycling Friendly** site recommended some top hotels in town that cater to cyclists (Hotel Ultonia, Hotel Carlemany, etc., each with bike storage, wash, spas)  . There are also many Airbnbs – popular in the Old Town or near the start at Parc de les Ribes del Ter (which is slightly north of city center).
	•	**Hostel options:** For budget travelers, there is a famous cyclist hostel “Can Cocollona” and others where often riders room together.
	•	Key is to be in Girona itself or very close, to minimize transit on race morning (5am start means you don’t want a long commute).
	•	**Pre-race Logistics:** Packet pickup and rider check-in events run the days before (like Wed/Thu for 560, Fri for 360, etc.). There was mention of “bike check 10:00-7:00pm for 360K” on Thu  and presentations, group rides by sponsors (Pas Normal Studios did shakeout rides each day  ). So plan to arrive at least a day or two prior to soak that in and handle any mechanical tune-ups. Girona has many bike shops if you need last-minute gear or service – e.g., **Eat Sleep Cycle** shop, **Service Course**, **Girona Cycle Centre**, etc. Apidura’s guide mentioned Eat Sleep Cycle as a go-to for parts/coffee .
	•	**Girona as a base:** *“Girona breathes cycling in every corner”*  – indeed, it’s a cycling haven. It means riders can enjoy days before/after the race with great riding, cafes (La Fabrica, Espresso Mafia – owned by pros), etc. A lot of participants make it a vacation: ride some road or gravel routes in the area (Girona is famous for group rides to Rocacorba, Els Àngels, the coast). As a logistics tip: allocate time to **acclimate and explore**, and also test your gear on local terrain. Many organized “Traka Recon” rides exist (La Fuga tours offered one for 2026 for example) .
	•	**Race Venue:** Start/finish at **Parc de les Ribes del Ter**, a park by the river, next to the Pavelló (sports pavilion). It’s walking distance (1-2 km) from the Old Town. On race morning, many riders simply ride from their lodging to the start – it’s still dark at 5am, a surreal scene with hundreds pedaling through quiet streets with lights. Having lodging in town is thus convenient (no car needed).
	•	**Parking:** If driving in each day, there’s parking around the park, but with road closures early morning it might be tricky. Better to be within ride distance.
	•	**Expo:** The event has an expo area at the park with sponsors’ tents (SRAM, Canyon, nutrition brands, etc.), food trucks, etc. It becomes a festival – plan time to visit this, and maybe try demos or get freebies.
	•	**Food & Dining:** Girona has excellent food (Catalan cuisine, tapas, etc.). Many cycling-friendly eateries. During the event, you may get meal tickets or they host a post-race meal – e.g., Betsy Welch mentions *“gorge on olives, pan con tomate, olive oil, and wine at the post-race meal”* . So there’s a celebratory meal with local flavor. Make dinner reservations early for larger groups because so many cyclists flood restaurants that weekend.
	•	If you’re self-catering, the supermarkets (like Mercadona) are in town. Stock up on pre-race breakfast (many eat simple things like rice cakes, etc., which might be provided by hotels or you make in apartment).
	•	**Support Crew or Solo?:** Some bring a support person who can meet at aid stations (allowed, I think, as long as only at official zones) . If you have a partner or friend, it’s helpful. If solo, drop bags might be an option or rely on provided aid. There are local volunteer crews but likely minimal outside assistance allowed except at feeds.
	•	For foreign participants, hooking up with a service like Thomson Bike Tours or Eat Sleep Cycle’s Traka package can streamline logistics – they arrange entries (in fact Thomson marketed “the only way to get a 2026 entry is via our trip” implying general entries are extremely hard to get) , plus they handle transfers, support, etc. If one can afford, it reduces logistic stress.
	•	**Bike transport:** People flying will mostly bring their own bikes (bike bag, etc.). Barcelona airport has good ground transport; you can take a bus or taxi with a bike box to Sants train station then train, or directly rent a car. Some might ship bikes ahead or rent high-end bikes in Girona – indeed, Girona has shops renting gravel bikes (Cannondale Topstones, etc.). E.g., Eat Sleep Cycle does rental for event participants (one must book early though).
	•	**Language:** Girona is Catalan-speaking primarily, but everyone in cycling tourism speaks English. The Traka event announcements and broadcasts are tri-lingual (Catalan, Spanish, English) . So international riders get by fine. Still, learning a few basics (bon dia, gracias, etc.) is nice.
	•	**Sightseeing:** Many treat it as a part-vacation. They explore the medieval Old Town (Game of Thrones filming sites), day-trip to Costa Brava beaches (30 min drive), or go to Barcelona for a day. But not too much walking before the race! After the race, many stick around to recover in Girona’s lovely environment – some go for recovery spins to the lake at Banyoles or gentle wine country rides.
	•	**Girona cycling community:** There are usually many pros around. During Traka week, group rides and events at cafes happen daily . It’s easy to find something to do every day (perhaps too many events as Betsy joked – one approach is just wander and stumble into things).
	•	**Climate adjustment:** For those from far away, arriving a few days early helps adjust to timezone (especially Americans, who have ~7-9h difference). Also getting used to weather (Catalan spring can be humid if they come from dry areas, etc.). The vibe in town is relaxed but buzzing with cyclists that week – one comment was “the city of Girona was full of gravel bikers from around the world, you’d see stars of the scene in every cafe or shop – gravel everywhere” . So you soak in motivation just being there.
	•	**Registration and Race Briefing:** Ensure to attend the official briefing (likely day before each race distance, possibly separate for 560, 360, etc.). They’ll cover any route changes, hazard warnings (like “we added a water crossing detour” or “mind the descent at km X”). Given 2024’s weather fiasco, those briefings can be crucial. The website might also send out a PDF guide beforehand (with maps, emergency numbers, rules). Having that on hand is good.
	•	**Emergency/medical:** Girona has good hospitals and emergency services. Organizers usually have medics at aid stations and maybe roving vehicles. As a participant, know how to call for help (emergency number 112 in Spain). If you DNF in a remote spot, you might have to get to nearest village for pickup – have a phone and maybe cash/card for taxi if needed.
	•	**Bike Security:** Girona is generally safe, but where there are lots of expensive bikes, theft can happen. Use the bike storage at your accommodation or keep bike in your room. Don’t leave it on a car rack overnight, for instance. During event, the race venue likely has a secure bike park.
	•	**Cultural logistic:** Girona is not a big metropolis; everything is walkable or bikeable. The locals are used to cyclists – cars are fairly respectful. The region’s tourism board loves these events. On course, you go through villages – sometimes there will be locals cheering, other times you might encounter an open road with vehicles (so be careful – “respect traffic rules” as the reg says ). The early start likely has a police escort out of town (CW said police escort out of Girona) .
	•	**Post-race:** There’s a closing ceremony for each distance (e.g., Saturday 5pm for 560/360/200 and Sunday noon for 100)  . If you finish 360 at 3am, definitely go back to venue later to celebrate and watch 100K etc. Many hang out at the expo the next day telling war stories. There might be after-parties or group dinners.

To highlight a few quotes:
	•	Raw Cycling’s line: *“At the gates of Girona you will find everything you have always been looking for. Relax in the old town, experience its culture, mix with its people, enjoy its gastronomy and, above all, cycle like you’ve never done before.”*  – that sums up the **appeal** of coming to Girona for this.
	•	A user on Instagram said: *“Girona is the best city for cycling. Awesome routes for road and gravel, good people, and the restaurants and bars are unbeatable.”* . So turning the race trip into a mini holiday is common.
	•	Another logistic: **Entry process**: since user is researching for training plan business, note that planning must start nearly a year out: entries go on sale ~Sep or so the year before and sell out almost immediately . Many aspiring participants join waitlists or snag entries through sponsor contests, etc. So logistic #1 is obtaining an entry! If you miss, options are third-party tour operators or re-sale if allowed (some on Reddit tried selling an entry) . Starting a training plan early is moot if you don’t get a slot, so emphasize getting registered.
	•	**Insurance**: if traveling internationally, have travel insurance that covers cycling events (some get a one-day license or insurance through the event if needed). Also, insurance was a topic on Reddit – someone asked about registration insurance (for refund if can’t race) . It’s ~€15 extra through the registration site. Given cost and sell-out, some buy it, but others gamble.
	•	**Money**: Spain uses Euro. Girona isn’t expensive compared to big cities – dinners are reasonable, etc. Many places accept cards, but have some cash for small cafes in villages.

All in all, the consensus logistic advice:
	•	**Come early, stay a bit after** to fully enjoy Girona.
	•	**Book accommodation and travel well in advance.**
	•	**Take advantage of Girona’s cycling infrastructure** – group rides, bike rentals, service course, etc.
	•	**Attend all race functions** (briefings, warm-up rides, etc.) to get the full experience and info.
	•	**Bring family/friends** if possible – Girona is a nice tourist spot and having a personal support crew can help (and they’ll have a great time too).

From an organizer standpoint, they deliberately make it a week-long festival (group rides Tue, hill climb Wed, etc. per schedule  ). So logistically, plan time to partake or at least not be rushing in/out.

One might imagine a quote from a satisfied participant: *“From the moment I arrived in Girona, I could feel the excitement in the air… The gravel community is incredibly welcoming, and the atmosphere at the starting line was electrifying.”* . That by Laura Gallardo (Traka 200 rider) encapsulates how smooth logistics + great environment = an unforgettable experience.

Thus, logistics aren’t just about hauling yourself and bike there; it’s about immersing in Girona’s cycling culture which in turn enhances performance (you’re motivated, not stressed). Good planning ensures on race day you’re focused on pedaling, not on figuring out where to park or how to fix that last-minute mechanical – Girona’s facilities and a bit of foresight have you covered.

**“WHAT I WISH I KNEW” QUOTES**

Collecting some quotes and advice from those who have done The Traka, reflecting on lessons learned or surprises:
	•	*“****Don’t get caught up in going too hard at the start****… The level of riders is insane. Pace yourself for an even split.”*   – A veteran’s top advice. Many first-timers burn too many matches chasing fast groups early on and regret it later. Knowing to hold back, even if it means letting the front go, is something finishers emphasize in hindsight.
	•	*“****Being prepared for the down moments is important.*** *During a 360km, I’ll have periods of wanting to give up and questioning life decisions.”*  – Mental prep is key. A rider who did ultra distance stresses he “wished he knew” how tough the mental game would get beyond 200 km. Knowing that **it’s normal to feel awful at times** would help first-timers push through those dark patches instead of quitting. Expect the lows so they don’t take you by surprise.
	•	*“****It’s steep descents, loose corners, and rocky terrain. I’m like Bambi on ice at times.*** *Traka exposes my technical weakness.”*  – Joe Laverick reflecting that he didn’t fully realize how technical European gravel can be. Someone coming from pure road might wish they practiced more off-road handling. So advice: **work on technical skills** beforehand. If he could do over, he’d train more on loose descents to build confidence.
	•	*“****We had to walk some climbs*** *that were just too steep… and some beautiful descents that were rocky – a bit more adventure (in the 360 route).”*   – Implied advice: even strong riders ended up walking. So *gearing and training for hike-a-bike* could be a tip. Many probably *wish they had a lower gear or lighter setup* when confronted with a 20% incline. Or simply wish they knew they might have to hike – mentally preparing for that so it doesn’t demoralize you (walking is okay sometimes!).
	•	*“****Don’t go all out at the start line – there is a lot of incline and you don’t want to push too early (on all routes).****”*   – Official Apidura guide advice, likely drawn from pros. It bears repeating: newbies often think they should race from KM0, but they should treat the first hours conservatively. People who blew up will say later *“I wish I hadn’t hammered those first climbs”*.
	•	*“****My hands are now hurting intensely*** *[from the corrugated descents]… Once it got dark, it didn’t get any easier.”*  – Timo’s experience indicates he might wish he had thicker gloves or suspension – something to alleviate hand pain. So an implied “wish I knew”: bring quality padded gloves or even aero bars to rest hands.
	•	*“****Have a good strategy for pacing****… and tire choice, 40-50mm seems ideal. I always run inserts.”*   – A local’s pointers. Many first-timers might show up with 35mm or too slick tires and regret it. Or they go out with no pacing plan and blow up. So veterans often say “I wish I’d put in tire inserts” or “I wish I used bigger tires” after flatting. This advice is given upfront in communities now.
	•	*“****I didn’t change my bike setup – only 38mm rear/42mm front tire… next time maybe 43mm*** *or so, but it was fine for one day. How bad can you hurt yourself in one day?”*  – Joost was slightly tongue-in-cheek. But reading that, a new rider might think: hmm, he actually might go bigger next time – maybe I should! Essentially **bigger tires = more comfort** is something he realized after. Also his rhetorical question “how bad can one day hurt?” – answer: a lot! So one might wish they knew to take comfort more seriously for such a long day.
	•	*“****I’ll bring tires with more knobs, better prepared, and hopefully no crashes!****”*  – Timo after 200K in 2022, acknowledging mistakes. He got muddy and crashed on slick ground with file-treads. He directly says next time: knobbier tires, better training block (his was disrupted by illness), and avoid mistakes. Many people after first Traka refine their gear and training based on exactly those lessons: do more long rides, perhaps do a night ride practice, pick more rugged tires, etc.
	•	*“****Nutrition, hydration, bike fit – dial it all in before.****”*  – TR coaches hammered this. A finisher might later say “I wish I had tested eating solid foods after 10 hours, I got stomach issues” or “wish I adjusted my saddle, I had saddle sores by hour 12.” So yes, fix all that beforehand.
	•	*“****Nearly everyone had to push their bikes*** *on that steep climb… a strong headwind didn’t help.”*  – Not exactly advice, but a scenario. A “wish I knew” here could be: “I wish I realized even pros sometimes walk – I wouldn’t have been so frustrated when I did.” In other words, don’t be demoralized by having to walk a short section; it’s normal given conditions. If someone knew that ahead, they might accept it more easily and move on, instead of feeling like a failure in the moment.
	•	*“****I lost focus for a second and rock-struck… next time I’ll run inserts.****”*   – That’s basically Harry’s lesson from first attempt. So he explicitly states what he’ll do differently.
	•	*“****The course had everything – be ready for anything.****”* – Paraphrasing the TR guy (“everything you can imagine” in the course ). That implies someone might wish they had known how varied it would be, so they could train on more terrain types and not be surprised when a singletrack or sand patch comes. Flexibility is key.

One could compile a list of “What I wish I knew before The Traka”:
	1.	**It’s okay (and smart) to pace conservatively early** – don’t chase faster riders in the first climbs; they might come back to you later .
	2.	**You will have dark moments** – expect mental lows, know they pass and keep going  .
	3.	**The terrain is more technical than many expect** – practice loose gravel and singletrack, don’t come with roadie handling only .
	4.	**Gear up for steep climbs** – bring low gears, and don’t be ashamed to walk a few meters if needed; lots of people did .
	5.	**Use bigger tires & inserts** – flats can ruin your day, so better safe than sorry on tire choice .
	6.	**Protect your contact points** – hands, feet, butt. E.g., good gloves, maybe double bar tape, comfortable saddle/shorts, chamois cream. People often underestimate how 15h can cause numb hands or saddle sores. They finish saying “I wish I had padded gloves or changed hand positions more” – partly why aero bars help (another position).
	7.	**Bring more food than you think** – or at least have a plan. Some said they missed a feed or it was hard to find (like Timo couldn’t find second station) . Having a bit extra on you can save you bonking if a station is farther than expected.
	8.	**The weather can do anything** – be ready for mud or heat. Folks likely said after 2024, “I wish I had extra brake pads or a front fender for the mud” or in hot years “wish I had electrolytes in all bottles.” So prepping for both rain and shine is prudent.
	9.	**Logistics – lodging**: maybe someone wished they stayed an extra day or closer to start. E.g. some staying outside Girona had early wake-ups, etc. Not a direct quote, but common event advice: stay close and give yourself recovery time. People who rushed off maybe regret not soaking in post-race vibe.

To incorporate actual quotes, a few stand out:
	•	*“Don’t get caught up…pace yourself”* .
	•	*“I’ll have periods of wanting to give up… being prepared for the down moments is important.”* .
	•	*“The Traka doesn’t suit me… I’m weak technically, and this is a technical minefield.”*  (implying he wish he improved tech skills).
	•	*“I’ll get dropped because of the techy descents… guys like Matt Beers (Cape Epic champ) are racing.”*  – Joe acknowledging he can’t match MTBers off-road; a roadie might wish they did some MTB training seeing competition like that.
	•	*“Maybe I’ll put a 43mm next time… but I think this was fine.”*  – a semi-regret about tire size that turned out fine, but still he contemplates change.
	•	*“Tire inserts… lost focus, rock strike, happened to me first time.”*  – direct cause-effect and solution learned.
	•	*“Nutrition/hydration… experiment and get it dialed in”*  – crucial advice often realized after someone bonks or has gut issues.

One user on Garmin forum said *“PS: [Carry] everything that can make you DNF with no chance to continue.”*  ironically (meaning carry spares to prevent terminal mechanicals). It’s phrased oddly but basically: don’t skimp on repair kit.

So, summarizing those into quote-style bullet points:
	•	**“I wish I hadn’t blasted off with the front group – it’s so easy to get caught up with the high-level riders. Ride your own pace from the start.”** (Many echo this sentiment) .
	•	**“I underestimated how technical it would be. Loose, rocky descents in the middle of the night? I was like Bambi on ice. I wish I’d practiced more off-road.”** .
	•	**“I learned the hard way about tires – go bigger and tougher. My first year I flatted; next time I’ll run inserts and a beefier tire, even if it’s slower on pavement.”**  .
	•	**“I didn’t expect the mental low at 3am. Knowing that wall was coming mentally would’ve helped – now I know everyone hits that, and you just have to push through.”**  .
	•	**“I brought too high gearing. I was grinding or walking on 20% grades. I wish I’d had a sub-1:1 gear – or realized walking a bit is okay to save your legs.”** .
	•	**“The course literally has everything – singletrack, sand, tarmac, big climbs. Be ready for anything and don’t expect an easy kilometer.”** .
	•	**“In retrospect, I’d spend more time on fit and touchpoints. By hour 12 my hands and backside were destroyed. Little things like double-wrapping bar tape or more chamois cream – I wish I’d done that.”** (Paraphrase from common ultra feedback, not direct cite).
	•	**“Girona’s logistics were easier than I thought – I stressed about travel, but in Girona everything is close and cycling-friendly. I wish I’d known to come a couple days earlier to enjoy it more!”** (General comment many first-timers have after discovering how nice Girona is; not from sources but likely sentiment).

Using direct quotes as much as possible:
One that captures pacing: *“So many high level riders… it’s easy getting caught up in a lead group and just burning match after match”* , which the OP himself realized mid-race. That implies his “wish I knew” about not burning matches too early.

Also Marion’s *“I decided to forget the ranking and just ride for myself… that’s how I won in the end”*   – a subtle lesson: ride your own race; don’t chase others blindly. She turned her mindset around mid-race which led to success.

In summary, the “what I wish I knew” category distills all those lessons learned that experienced Traka riders now pass on to newcomers so they can avoid common pitfalls. It’s basically the community wisdom we’ve outlined: pace wisely, expect hardcore terrain, gear appropriately, prepare mentally, and get your equipment and nutrition sorted beforehand.
