# THE WATERMOO — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Ken Lemieux [COMPETITIVE]:** "Before the Watermoo race, I had only done two rides that were 100 miles long, and my longest race was 35 miles. Derek Johnson and Karl Kramer from the Sunday Polly Ann A group ride were also racing, so I decided to give it a try, even though I knew I wasn't as good as them. I wanted to challenge myself. And challenge myself I did! I fell behind on staying hydrated and getting enough nutrition, so it was difficult for me to keep up with any groups of riders. When I reached mile 72, the aid station saved me. I was able to fill up my water bottles and grab some snacks, which gave me a mental boost. At mile 78, there was the infamous river crossing…no bridge!. This year, the water was knee-deep. It rained three times during the race, and as a result, I ended up very dirty. In the end, I came in 121st out of 200 riders (275 registered, but some might not have participated because of the weather forecast)."

**Nicholas Stanko (Race Creator) [ELITE]:** "At 88-miles, THE WATERMOO will be no walk in the park for those looking to get a taste of what makes longer gravel racing so rewarding. Elite riders at the front of the pack competing for the top 5 cash purse will be pushed to their limits to see who becomes the King and Queen of THE WATERMOO."
