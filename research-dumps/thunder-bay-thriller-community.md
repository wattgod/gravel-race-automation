# THUNDER BAY THRILLER — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Tracy Gravlin [ELITE]:** "The gravel was fast and easy. There was some good climbing in the middle part of the course. There were several areas that reminded me of Nebraska with the long roads and farm fields with corn. I felt good and was moving along pretty good until the last 14 miles of the race. At that point we entered a dark forest road. I was by myself and had nobody to work with. There were potholes to look out for and many deep sand areas. I was so happy that my Lauf and my mindset got me through the sand. But my mph definitely lowered. 7 miles of that and then on to a single track that was even more deep sand! Wow. It was tricky for me all the way around. I had to get off and run with the bike four times. I fell over once. But was proud of myself for riding through the majority."

**Tracy Gravlin [ELITE]:** "I took off and felt great. The top 5 women were going to medal in the 62 miler. I was hoping to make five. There was a woman behind me at one point halfway in, so I pushed hard to distance myself from her. I ended third woman OA and couldn't have been happier. It was a slower time than I had wanted, but I didn't know there would be such sand traps." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/tracys-story-thunder-bay-thriller)

**Bike Choice [OFFICIAL/UNKNOWN LEVEL]:** "There will be some fast rolling hero gravel, slightly rougher two-track, and a bit of (dare I say it?) sand from time to time on the back trails! Just enough for a good time...If you would rather hop on the mountain bike for more comfort on the trails, totally doable and a nice option in a few sections."
