# TOR DIVIDE — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Laura [RECREATIONAL]:** "I came away from the Tor Divide and the Tor Divide Bursary with an experience I'll carry with me for a lifetime - new skills, a renewed sense of what's possible, and an even greater curiosity for the kind of places Bert and I can explore next... Your first step doesn't have to be epic. It just has to be yours and in way that feels right to you." (https://tordivide.co.uk/resources/tor-divide-reflections-2025)

**Laura [RECREATIONAL]:** "There were descents that tested the limits of my internal squeal-o-meter and moments that caught me off guard—like getting winded by a gate that didn't swing quite as wide as I expected it to, or the kind woman who gave me a perfectly timed shove via my saddlebag when I was mid-wobble on a steep section of a climb." (https://tordivide.co.uk/resources/tor-divide-reflections-2025)

**Laura [RECREATIONAL]:** "I bivvied in the wild for the first time, strayed off the map more than once (including five minutes of shouting 'hello?' into a patch of dense woodland), and soaked in the views of the Peak District with a grin I couldn't seem to shift." (https://tordivide.co.uk/resources/tor-divide-reflections-2025)

**Claire Frecknall [RECREATIONAL]:** "I've often heard it said that 'UK gravel riding is just 90's mountain biking' and that isn't too far from the truth. The terrain we are now happy to ride with drop bars and a rigid frame isn't dissimilar, but the ever-increasing tyre sizes and slacker angles appearing on gravel bikes show however that we are looking to push the boundaries of what is possible." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-tor-divide-2024)

**Claire Frecknall [RECREATIONAL]:** "We had averaged a mere 10 kmh for the first 35 km... The steep road climb up Mam Tor was a rude awakening less than 1km from the start line! By the time we arrived at our first refuelling stop of the day, we had averaged a mere 10kmh for the first 35km, including a hike before Ladybower Reservoir and very slow trudge up and over Cut Gate." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-tor-divide-2024)

**Claire Frecknall [RECREATIONAL]:** "Sometimes, even with wide 650b rims and 2.1" tyres, I still wished I was riding an actual mountain bike." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-tor-divide-2024)

**Claire Frecknall [RECREATIONAL]:** "By the time we reached the summit [of Jacob's Ladder], the sun was setting, with the sky turning beautiful shades of pink and orange... the descent was badly eroded, steep and rocky, so we tentatively rode sections of it between ungainly tip-toeing and sliding with our bikes alongside us, brakes locked on to prevent us getting dragged down the hill." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-tor-divide-2024)

**VecchioJo [RECREATIONAL]:** "I suppose the signs that it was going to be a tough day were there right from the off. After just a few minutes of cruising along the valley floor we wheel left, and immediately click through all the gears to climb the Mam Nick road up Mam Tor in one of the more unnecessarily brutal starts to a cycling event I think I've done." (https://road.cc/content/blog/taking-on-inaugural-tor-divide-bikepacking-peak-district-308797)

**VecchioJo [RECREATIONAL]:** "Maybe on a full-suspension mountain bike and with a decent pair of legs you'd have half a chance [on Jaggers Clough]. Bike selection was the matter of much discussion, as the route notes admit that the first loop taking in most of the Dark Peak is definitely more mountain bike-friendly, whilst the second loop around the more genteel White Peak favours a gravel bike." (https://road.cc/content/blog/taking-on-inaugural-tor-divide-bikepacking-peak-district-308797)

**VecchioJo [RECREATIONAL]:** "If I were to ride this again I'd bring a lightweight hardtail mountain bike with fast running tyres... The first riders home on both the long and short courses did so in 11 and 13 hours respectively, and both were on lightweight full suspension bikes. This probably speaks volumes as to time saved on the rocky bits versus any tardiness on the smoother sectors." (https://road.cc/content/blog/taking-on-inaugural-tor-divide-bikepacking-peak-district-308797)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Claire Frecknall [RECREATIONAL] - Bikes:** "I was impressed by... my Mason Bokeh gravel bike with its chunky tyres and expansive gear range... However, whilst the distances on offer were achievable by most over the weekend the terrain meant it was not for total beginners. He warned that the route was challenging in places and recommended riding either a mountain bike or a gravel bike with the biggest tyres you could possibly fit." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-tor-divide-2024)

**VecchioJo [RECREATIONAL] - Bikes:** "Individual bike choice on display showed that everyone would be on the right bike at some point, a totally inappropriate one somewhere else... there was everything from full suspension mountain bikes through all the subsets of gravel bikes to things that were quite scarily cyclo-crossy." (https://road.cc/content/blog/taking-on-inaugural-tor-divide-bikepacking-peak-district-308797)

**VecchioJo [RECREATIONAL] - Bike Selection Strategy:** "The manual says the best bike is the one you already of course, but it says a gravel bike with the fattest tyres you could fit would be manageable… we had those. Just how much the northern loop was MTB-biased was more significant than anticipated, and any sluggishness on the tarmac or more hardpacked sections on a mountain bike would more than be made up for in speed, control, rideability and comfort off-road." (https://road.cc/content/blog/taking-on-inaugural-tor-divide-bikepacking-peak-district-308797)

**Claire Frecknall [RECREATIONAL] - Packing Strategy:** "We were hoping to complete the full 242km with just a few hours sleep out on the moors somewhere... Our bikes, both gravel ones with chunky 650b rubber on, are only half weighed down with mandatory and just-in-case kit. We're bikepacking lite and hope to move swiftly. We have the obligatory battery packs, bivy bags, waterproofs, warm hats, extra warm clothes and sleeping kit if we decided we need to ride through the night and/or kip down for a bit." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-tor-divide-2024)

**Laura [RECREATIONAL] - Support from Sponsors:** "Peak Bikefitting brought extra comfort to Bert's setup, and CIOVITA and Schwalbe Tyres provided kit that didn't just survive the journey but thrived. From clothing that held strong through unpredictable weather and endless washes, to tyres that rolled confidently over everything the Peak District threw at them." (https://tordivide.co.uk/resources/tor-divide-reflections-2025)

**VecchioJo [RECREATIONAL] - Event Schwag:** "The start schwag was actually useful with a Styrkr energy bar, a pair of GRVL socks and overnight tub of Happy Bottom Bum Butter chamois cream." (https://road.cc/content/blog/taking-on-inaugural-tor-divide-bikepacking-peak-district-308797)

## Weather Experienced

**Claire Frecknall [RECREATIONAL] - 2024 Weather:** "It was a notoriously snowy and brutal year, especially in the high country of Colorado [referring to Tour Divide 2022 that inspired the rider]... After a scramble up the grassy western side of the hill we reached the summit to witness a stunning pre-dawn sky... By the time we reached the summit [of Jacob's Ladder], the sun was setting, with the sky turning beautiful shades of pink and orange." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-tor-divide-2024)

**Claire Frecknall [RECREATIONAL] - 2024 Conditions:** "The track is greasy after heavy overnight rain and it's still a bit too early to deal with a squirming bike on insufficiently grippy tyres... Those riders on the full suspension mountain bikes with chunky tyres that flourished on yesterday's technical singletrack would no doubt have found today's ride much more of a slog." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-tor-divide-2024)

**Laura [RECREATIONAL] - 2025 Weather:** "From clothing that held strong through unpredictable weather and endless washes..." (https://tordivide.co.uk/resources/tor-divide-reflections-2025)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Claire Frecknall [RECREATIONAL] - Northern Loop (Dark Peak):** "The route's beaten-up bridleways, grassy hillsides and stretches of loose rocky singletrack were all challenging enough to be fun on my Mason Bokeh... Although tough, the terrain here was largely ridable, some quiet road sections, fun descents and beautiful viewpoints made the leg-burning climbs worthwhile." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-tor-divide-2024)

**Claire Frecknall [RECREATIONAL] - Southern Loop (White Peak):** "After a loose descent we hit the road and from here onwards the route mostly followed the purpose-built cycle paths of the Heritage Railway, Cromford Canal path and up the long climb to the High Peak and Tissington Trails, meaning the miles towards the finish line quickly glided by on our bikes." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-tor-divide-2024)

**Claire Frecknall [RECREATIONAL] - Specific Sections:** "The section from Burbage to Curbar was my favourite part of the route with fast-rolling sandy ground which was all ridable, but with enough challenging sections to keep things interesting." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-tor-divide-2024)

**Claire Frecknall [RECREATIONAL] - Late-Route Surprise:** "With 20km to go, just as you thought you're nearly home, the route left the cycle path to drop down a steep descent only to hit you with a steep hike straight back up the other side. Some more rolling hills and one last ascent of Mam Tor stood between us and a cold beer and freshly cooked pizza back at Edale Village hall." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-tor-divide-2024)

**VecchioJo [RECREATIONAL] - Mam Tor Section:** "After just a few minutes of cruising along the valley floor we wheel left, and immediately click through all the gears to climb the Mam Nick road up Mam Tor... Thankfully the weather is on our side, and the slowly unfolding view over our left shoulders is mostly worth the too soon effort and after 2km of climbing and within sight of the top we dog leg back north and head off road." (https://road.cc/content/blog/taking-on-inaugural-tor-divide-bikepacking-peak-district-308797)

**VecchioJo [RECREATIONAL] - Technical Challenges:** "Everyone around us is dabbing and fluffing as they attempt to find their groove through the ruts, rocks and slide... We bump along the pavement slabs of the Mam Tor ridge path, and as it's still before breakfast we annoy the minimum of walkers before turning sharp left and bouncing downhill." (https://road.cc/content/blog/taking-on-inaugural-tor-divide-bikepacking-peak-district-308797)

**VecchioJo [RECREATIONAL] - Jaggers Clough:** "I do remember the water bars as we drop downhill on the way to Hope Cross, and I recall the river and ensuing steep climb out of Jaggers Clough which is now a definite loose surface dismount and trudge." (https://road.cc/content/blog/taking-on-inaugural-tor-divide-bikepacking-peak-district-308797)

**VecchioJo [RECREATIONAL] - Trail Evolution:** "I shot through a good bit of the field and ended up with far more photos than most folks would want to scroll through... While my gravel bike with tubeless tyres, disc brakes, all the gears and confident handling is considerably more reassuring off-road than my racey cross-country bike from back then, it's still quite a handful at times. It doesn't help that the paths have changed a lot since then, and to try to stave off erosion from foot fall and wheel rub, barrowloads of stone and rock have been thrown down to carpet and protect the trails." (https://road.cc/content/blog/taking-on-inaugural-tor-divide-bikepacking-peak-district-308797)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Claire Frecknall [RECREATIONAL] - Pacing Reality:** "Progress was much swifter today [second day]... we had averaged a mere 10kmh for the first 35km [first day]... Our alarm was set for 4am and after a scramble up the grassy western side of the hill we reached the summit to witness a stunning pre-dawn sky." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-tor-divide-2024)

**Claire Frecknall [RECREATIONAL] - Overnight Strategy:** "There was still a glimmer of light in the sky as we reached Edale, so we could have pedalled on, but the call of the pub and a comfortable night sleeping in our van was too great. We would take on the second of three ascents of Mam Tor at sunrise." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-tor-divide-2024)

**Claire Frecknall [RECREATIONAL] - Fueling:** "Fuelled for the next climb, we made good progress on the road up out of Hathersage... our standard forecourt bikepacking breakfast… yogurt, pastries, bananas and vending machine coffee." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-tor-ide-2024)

**Laura [RECREATIONAL] - Spontaneous Partnerships:** "A standout moment was unexpectedly meeting two fellow Peak Gravellers in Bakewell (Gareth and Neil). We shared a wild camp spot, rode the remaining miles together and laughed for a substantial chunk of this duration. It was the kind of spontaneous connection I hadn't anticipated but will always remember." (https://tordivide.co.uk/resources/tor-divide-reflections-2025)

**VecchioJo [RECREATIONAL] - Planning Options:** "There is a Plan B to kip in the van for a bit, as the route handily loops back to Edale at the end of the northern half before beginning the southern one." (https://road.cc/content/blog/taking-on-inaugural-tor-divide-bikepacking-peak-district-308797)

**Event Design [UNKNOWN] - Format Options:** "The figure of eight design meant that the basic farmer's field campsite at Edale was perfectly located for those wanting to break the route into two and not have to carry camping kit with them - a good option for those new to bikepacking who hadn't yet spent hundreds of pounds on lightweight sleeping kit and bags, or for those who just want to enjoy the already challenging climbs without the extra weight holding them back." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-tor-divide-2024)

**Fastest Finishers [ELITE/COMPETITIVE] - Timing:** "The first riders home on both the long and short courses did so in 11 and 13 hours respectively, and both were on lightweight full suspension bikes." (https://road.cc/content/blog/taking-on-inaugural-tor-divide-bikepacking-peak-district-308797)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Laura [RECREATIONAL]:** "Which brings me to what truly stuck with me the most—the people. The Tor Divide felt open and inclusive in the most genuine way. There was no pressure, no posturing—just people riding (or hiking!) their bikes in whatever way brought them joy. Whether zipping along for a speed demon time or taking it at a pace to savour the views, you were welcome. I shared so many gorgeous moments with folk along the route—swapping stories, giggling at gates, and mutually huffing on some hot climbs. That sense of community was incredibly strong, and it's stayed with me long after the event wrapped up." (https://tordivide.co.uk/resources/tor-divide-reflections-2025)

**Claire Frecknall [RECREATIONAL]:** "Rolling back into the carpark we were greeted by cheers from already finished riders gathered around. Whether you had completed the long or short loop, a combination of the two or even just part of the route, it didn't matter, as we all had stories to tell and experiences gained. Valerio welcomed everyone home with a huge smile and I expect, an element of relief." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-tor-divide-2024)

**Valerio Stuart (Event Organizer) [UNKNOWN]:** "His intention with the Tor Divide is to provide a safe environment and opportunity for first time bikepackers to test themselves against a challenging route without the need to jump straight into a gruelling multi-day race, and yet offer a tough and varied enough route to keep experienced riders entertained for a day or so. Valerio wanted to conjure up something that treads the fine line between not being too easy and yet still challenging and rewarding, not too expensive so that it's still accessible, and not too sanitised so that it's still representative of unsupported bikepacking, and also to showcase the beauty of the Peak District." (https://road.cc/content/blog/taking-on-inaugural-tor-divide-bikepacking-peak-district-308797)

**VecchioJo [RECREATIONAL] - Demographics:** "It's everyone from complete first timers to hardened bikepacking veterans, and as is common with bikepacking there was a larger than usual percentage of female participants. Nowhere near the 50/50 split that some events strive for, but still encouraging in the world of cycling sausagefests." (https://road.cc/content/blog/taking-on-inaugural-tor-divide-bikepacking-peak-district-308797)

**VecchioJo [RECREATIONAL] - Sustainability Efforts:** "There are lots of reasons to applaud Valerio for what he's trying to do... Participants were encouraged to travel sustainably and arrive by public transport, helped by a train station a stone's throw from the start. Riders were offered a small refund if they travelled more than 10 miles to get to the event using public transport or cycling. On top of this, the Tor Divide raised £920 for RIDE Sheffield. £5 of each entry went towards the group that uses the collective might of Sheffield's mountain bike community to improve, preserve and promote access interests for off-road cyclists in the area." (https://road.cc/content/blog/taking-on-inaugural-tor-divide-bikepacking-peak-district-308797)

**Event Format [UNKNOWN]:** "There was no mass start and riders left whenever they were ready. As we woke up late and had quite a faffy morning despite being parked within sight of the Village Hall start HQ, we were among the last to leave and spent all day catching up with riders and riding with them for short whiles." (https://road.cc/content/blog/taking-on-inaugural-tor-divide-bikepacking-peak-district-308797)

**Valerio Stuart (about Laura) [UNKNOWN]:** "Laura truly embodies the spirit of Tor Divide: it's not about speed, gear or appearance, but about showing up, being open to the unknown, and discovering what you're capable of." (https://tordivide.co.uk/resources/tor-divide-reflections-2025)

## Event Structure & Rules

**Route Options [UNKNOWN]:** "The Tor Divide is a fixed route unsupported event designed to be ridden as a single stage, crossing the Peak District up, over and along every surface you can imagine: forest trails, bridleways, singletrack and quiet scenic roads, rock, gravel and bog. There is a shorter Tor Divide option of the Millstone route of 163km with only about 3,500m of ascent to deal with if the longer distance, and its corresponding number of over 4,500 metres of climbing, is a bit much for you." (https://road.cc/content/blog/taking-on-inaugural-tor-divide-bikepacking-peak-district-308797)

**Self-Support Rules [UNKNOWN]:** "As a self-supported event riders can decide where and when to eat or sleep, as long as they follow the format principles and only use facilities available to all, and don't get any pre-arranged outside assistance. To be listed as a finisher, riders have to complete one of the two routes in less than 36 hours; although like most events of this kind, there are no prizes for rolling in first. There is a pizza and beer for everyone at the end though." (https://road.cc/content/blog/taking-on-inaugural-tor-divide-bikepacking-peak-district-308797)

**Accommodation Options [UNKNOWN]:** "There were also numerous accommodation options along the route if you preferred to book a comfortable bed and a hot shower." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-tor-divide-2024)
