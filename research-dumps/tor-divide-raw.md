- Multiple singletrack sections near finish

**Technical Difficulty Level**
**Moderate to challenging.** According to a 2024 ride report: "whilst the distances on offer were achievable by most over the weekend the terrain meant it was not for total beginners."[3] One reviewer stated the route was "challenging in places" and warned that riders should bring "the biggest tyres you could possibly fit" on a gravel bike or use a mountain bike.[3]

Another challenge noted: "With 20km to go, just as you thought you're nearly home, the route left the cycle path to drop down a steep descent only to hit you with a steep hike straight back up the other side."[3]

The 2024 event featured **Jacob's Ladder**, a notably steep climb where one mother and her 13-year-old daughter camped overnight.[3]

**Elevation Profile Description**
The Peak District is described as "rocky and hilly."[1] The Divide route (250km) features 5500m+ of climbing, while the Peak Gravel route (200km) includes 4000m+ of elevation gain.[5]

- **Bike choice:** "A gravel bike with wide tyres and MTB gearing or a MTB with fast tyres are recommended for the event."[1]
