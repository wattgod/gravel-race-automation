### Key Military Roads & Gravel Sections

#### Strada dell'Assietta
- Old military dirt road
- Rolling ridgeline above 2,000m
- Motorbike tourists create dust clouds
- Can be disconcerting with heavily laden motorcycles

#### Strada dei Cannoni
- Runs along Varaita-Maria ridge
- Stunning views of Monviso
- Features biggest gravel (rocks) on route
- More suitable for MTB than gravel bikes
- Has been done on 35mm tyres (not recommended)
- Subject to closures for repairs

#### Via del Sale (Salt Road)

- Final section before Nice
- "Complete joy, dream gravel and amazing views"
- Not suitable for those with vertigo

### Hike-a-Bike Sections (Optional)

#### Col du Peas

- ~1 mile taking almost an hour
- Rewarded with incredible plateau and singletrack descent

#### Little Peru Access
- 4-hour climb, pushing bikes most of it
- Overtaken by hikers with trekking poles
- Steep, rocky - difficult even for hikers

#### Tandem Considerations
- First hike-a-bike: steep switch-backed carry to 2,600m - difficult

- Road alternatives exist for both hike-a-bike sections

### Terrain Difficulty Rating

## WEATHER

### Timing
- Event held first week of September
- Late summer in Alps

### Temperature Ranges
- **Valleys**: Can reach 30+C heat waves
- **Turin baseline**: ~24C average in September
- **High altitude (2,000m+)**: Can drop below 10C
- **Night/morning at altitude**: Significant temperature drops

### Weather Challenges
- **Snow**: Possible at high passes, even early September
- **Rain**: Unpredictable mountain weather
- **Cold descents**: Col Agnel descent "particularly cold and bleak"
- **Heat in valleys**: Draining at altitude, dehydration risk
- **Afternoon thunderstorms**: Clouds build ominously
- **Dust**: Dry conditions on gravel, especially with motor traffic

### Specific Reports
- "Snow and unrelenting rain can take hold"
- "Rain at lower elevations with snow remaining at top of passes"
- "30-degree temperatures in valleys had me feeling drained"

### Weather Philosophy
- "Anyone motivated and well equipped for any mountain weather can finish"
- Must be prepared for sudden changes
- Bring gear for warm valleys AND cold/snowy passes

---

## FORUM INSIGHTS

### TrainerRoad Forum Discussion
- Riders planning 6-7 days
- Key concerns: weather, road maintenance, accommodation
- Accommodation at top of passes is limited

### Singletrack World Forum
- Discussion about TNR on tandem
- Gravel bikepacking route recommendations
- Hike-a-bike sections feasibility debates

### Common Advice Themes

#### Bike Choice Debate
- "No one bike will be perfect for the whole route - that's part of its charm"
- "The bike is just the facilitator for enjoying Europe's best high-mountain riding"
- Gravel bikes: Faster on tarmac sections but struggle on rocky military roads
- MTBs: Encourage seeking trails less traveled, better on rough stuff
- Ideal: "Mega-geared drop-bar bike with 2-inch tyres"

#### Gearing Recommendations
- Low gearing is essential
- "Mega-low gearing should be at the top of the priority list"
- Example setup: Compact chainrings (50/34) with 11-36 cassette
- Remember: hauling bike, luggage, AND yourself up mountains
- Gravel gearing leans toward sportier riding, not multi-day epics

#### Tire Recommendations
- 47c WTB Venture tubeless (650b) - extra volume welcome on rough sections
- 2.0" tires with suspension fork
- 2.4" tires to soak up bumps
- 50mm clearance upgrade (Whisky No.7 forks)
- Running tubeless highly recommended
- 35mm has been done on rocky sections (not recommended)

#### Equipment Tips
- Waterproof bikepacking bags are "life-savers"
- Apidura Expedition Range: robust, waterproof, no sliding
- Check valve cores are tight before starting
- Glasses protection important (accidental breakage possible)
- Camera protection needed (screen scratching from bags)

#### Wild Camping
- Key: Be discreet, arrive late, leave early
- Don't hop fences into private land
- Technically not permitted but accepted around 2000m+
- Especially tolerated for bikers/hikers
- Can camp at refugios by asking

#### Resupply Strategy
- Italy has good network of water taps in villages
- Fountains in villages and outside refuges
- Via del Sale: fountains very rare, plan accordingly
- Refuges can shut early unexpectedly
- Morning: refuel, clean kit, do laundry in village troughs

## BLACK PILL (Harsh Realities)

### DNF Factors

#### Weather-Related Scratches
- Snow and unrelenting rain forced riders to stop in Sampeyre
- Col Agnel descent "particularly cold and bleak, especially for toes"
- Hypothermia risk on high passes in bad weather

#### Road Conditions
- Strada dei Cannoni subject to repairs and closures
- Massive rockslides can wipe away roads
- One rider descended 1,000m to find road completely gone
- Options: retrace steps or sketch across scattered rocks

#### Technical Failures
- Technical difficulties can strand you before starting
- Broken glasses on day 1 = riding 5 days without eyewear
- Scratched screens from bag rubbing
- Tubeless issues if valve cores aren't tight

### Physical Demands
- 30C temperatures at altitude = severe fatigue and dehydration
- "By this time in the day, I have to admit I was feeling it"
- Altitude + heat + climbing = completely drained
- Hike-a-bike sections: 4 hours pushing bike, overtaken by hikers

### Hazards

#### Motor Traffic
- Motorbike tourers buzz by on certain sections
- "Heavily laden lumbering beasts throwing up great clouds of dust"
- Squeezed into rougher rocks at track edges
- Altitude breathing + constant dust = unpleasant combination

#### Rockfall
- "Constant covering of gravel and stones fallen from valley sides"
- Should alert to dangers ahead
- Active rockslide zones

#### Navigation Challenges
- Route options require decision-making
- Some older routes now impassable
- Must use current route files from official website

### Completion Times Reality
- Fast riders: 4-5 days (Croatian riders "almost twice as fast")
- Typical finish: 5-7 days
- "Loads of time. Nothing about this ride is meant to be rushed!"
- Philosophy: It's not a race

### Mental Challenges
- "Adventurers must deal with adverse weather AND fight with themselves"
- Exhausted brains work less efficiently
- Gear care becomes critical when fatigued
- Long days alone at altitude

### What Can Go Wrong
- Van breakdown 80km from Turin (towed to Navara)
- Route closures for road repairs
- Refuges closing early (no food/shelter)
- Weather windows closing rapidly
- Equipment damage from rocky terrain
