## Race Strategy & Pacing

**[UNKNOWN LEVEL]** - The TTT 103 has a resupply opportunity in **Tripoli at mile 77**, with lunch available in Ogema (mile 52). Riders must be "prepared to support yourself with whatever you can buy in Tripoli and the Windmill." The Willow 63 has **no resupply**, requiring complete self-support. (https://www.ironbull.org/ttt-details)

Navigation requires self-sufficiency as **"the course is not marked"** — riders must use paper cue sheets, GPX files, or phones. (https://www.ironbull.org/ttt-details)

All riders check in at the Windmill "finish" (mile 99 for TTT 103, mile 57 for Willow 63, mile 27 for Windmill 33) before spinning down the bike path back to SARA Park. An ice cream shop is available at the Windmill stop on Lake Nokomis. (https://www.ironbull.org/ttt-details)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

The TTT is described as an **"old school free gravel bike ride"** with no entry fee. IRONBULL, a 501(c)(3) charitable organization, created the free format as a result of the pandemic in 2020 and "recognized its value."

**Shane Hitz [UNKNOWN]** (Essential Gravel creator): **"We have top-notch gravel opportunities out our back door. Visitors often marvel at the quality of gravel riding we have in Central Wisconsin."** (https://silentsportsmagazine.com/stories/ironbull-brings-more-free-gravel-riding-to-north-central-wisconsin,130029)

The event welcomes beginners — in 2020, **two-thirds of Essential Gravel riders completed their first ever gravel ride**, and in 2021 over half were new to the sport. The 7th edition specifically includes "additional shorter route options to encourage new gravel bike riders."

SARA Park offers post-ride amenities including **showers, a beach, and camping** — riders are advised to "bring a towel." (https://www.ironbull.org/ttt-details)

The TTT had a hiatus in 2020 and 2021, with the 2022 edition being the fourth edition. The 7th edition is scheduled for June 2026. (https://www.ironbull.org/ttt-details, https://www.ironbull.org/in-the-news/free-gravel-2022)

The event is part of the **Ironbear 1000**, which "highlights Wisconsin's epic gravel."
