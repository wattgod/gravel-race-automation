# TOUR DE GAP — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**reever [UNKNOWN]:** "I'm trying to try to figure out if I did good or bad today. I averaged 18.6mph over a very hilly course--definitely designed for an upright. I only placed 8th in my age group of 50-59, and 30th overall. There were some young guns here who were really tough from all over Texas and some from Colorado and even Mexico." (https://rbentonline.org/YaBB.pl?board=reports;action=multidel;thread=1437860382/0) - Rode Tour de Gap 2015 on a recumbent, hit over 40 mph on descents.

**The Old Guy Bicycle Blog author [RECREATIONAL]:** "I trained over 6,000 miles for a solo bicycle tour from San Diego to Las Cruces... And then — Day One. Crash. Broken bike. Bloodied pride. Tour over before it even began... So I made a new plan: I'd keep training. I'd keep riding. But I'd show up for one organized event each month... It started with this weekend: the Buffalo Gap Tour de Gap. A timed event, sure — but I didn't come to race anyone but myself. I've got nothing to prove to the guys with shaved legs and sunglasses you could land a plane with. I'm not chasing KOMs. I'm chasing peace. Fitness. Grit. Redemption." (https://www.theoldguybicycleblog.com/2025/07/buffalo-gap-tour-de-gap-one-ride-at.html) - July 2025 edition, rode as part of personal redemption after cancelled tour.
