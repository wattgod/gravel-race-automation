# TOUR DE GAP - RAW RESEARCH DUMP

## CRITICAL DISCREPANCY

The search results reference **Tour de Gap in Buffalo Gap, Texas** — not Fulton, Mississippi as stated in your known info. The provided search results contain no information about a Tour de Gap in Fulton, Mississippi. I cannot confirm whether the location, distance, and elevation details you provided refer to a different event, a discontinued race, or an error in your research parameters. I will report only on the Texas event found in the search results.
