# TOUR DE NEBRASKA — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Sandy H., TDN veteran [UNKNOWN]:** "TDN is for people who enjoy cycling, meeting people, exploring small town America at your own pace, all of which makes this ride one of the most enjoyable bike tours in the Midwest." (https://www.tourdenebraska.com/)

**JOM [ELITE]:** "I did score a freebie luggage trolley, win!" (describing pre-Gravel Worlds logistics at Omaha airport) (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-150-hot-miles-of-the-2018-gravel-worlds-and-about-87-hills-lincoln-nebraska-usa/)

**JOM [ELITE]:** "I don't recall where I heard it, but someone over the weekend remarked there were 87 hills along the full 150-mile course. As a reminder, I spend a lot of my year in Florida, and even though there are some decent hills where I live, they don't hold the remotest flicker of a candle to the hills of Lincoln, Nebraska. With zero hill training, what could possibly go wrong?!" (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-150-hot-miles-of-the-2018-gravel-worlds-and-about-87-hills-lincoln-nebraska-usa/)

**hubcyclist [COMPETITIVE]:** "i did the 150 in 2019, finished in 10hrs, although I think I was on pace to do 8.5-9. I picked a bad time to try a new thing, a full camelback 3l, which I attribute to lower back pain I got about halfway through and really messed up my ability to keep on the power. It's very up and down and not flat, despite the perception of nebraska being pancake flat." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/the-nebraska-garmin-gravel-worlds-2024-tell-me-about-it/95329)

**koalb [COMPETITIVE]:** "You'll hear the promoters talk about riding 'the gravel seas', and that's exactly it. You're going to be up and down over the whole course. None of the climbs are that big, but there are a ton of them. Manage your speed on the downhills and you will be fine." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/the-nebraska-garmin-gravel-worlds-2024-tell-me-about-it/95329)

**KCBikeNerd [COMPETITIVE]:** "I hurt lol. Omg it was so hot. Heat index was 105+. Flat at mile 30 that was a pain to fix. Then mile 60-120 was into a headwind. Stung on the head by something at mile 80ish. Still a welt there. Heat got me hard so I chilled for a while at a stop at mile 100 and 120 to cool down and catch up on hydration, electrolytes, and calories." (10:52 moving time, 13:20 total time for the 150 in 2024) (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/the-nebraska-garmin-gravel-worlds-2024-tell-me-about-it/95329)

**KCBikeNerd [COMPETITIVE]:** "It pretty much slaughtered the mid/tail end of the 'party pace' folks just wanting to complete it." (describing mile 60-120 headwind section) (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/the-nebraska-garmin-gravel-worlds-2024-tell-me-about-it/95329)

**Matt Beers [ELITE]:** "The running in the mud made it really hard and really decisive, to be honest. I got caught out in the first mud section pretty bad, and I had to bridge up through three groups, so I really had to dig in to stay at the front." (2025 Gravel Worlds winner) (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/results-matt-beers-and-rosa-kloser-win-lauf-gravel-worlds-2025-in-a-duo-of-two-up-sprints/)

**Matt Beers [ELITE]:** "It was really fun to go to the line with one of my best mates. We played our cards and attacked in the right spots. On the last MMR road, Keegan went really hard, and I just stuck with him before we motored on and sprinted at the finish. I have been working on my sprints so I was pretty confident — but yeah, brutal day out there." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/results-matt-beers-and-rosa-kloser-win-lauf-gravel-worlds-2025-in-a-duo-of-two-up-sprints/)

**Rosa Kloser [ELITE]:** "It was quite tough, I must say. The second MMR was quite muddy, and at the end we made a split with six of us. I was really on the limit with my bike; I just made it out. I could see how packed my bike was with mud. Gee [Schreurs] was really driving it, and she was like, 'Girls, this is the move of the day.' Then I decided to just grind it out. Due to the SRAM Transmission system, I could push it in the mud without losing the derailleur." (2025 women's winner) (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/results-matt-beers-and-rosa-kloser-win-lauf-gravel-worlds-2025-in-a-duo-of-two-up-sprints/)

**Rosa Kloser [ELITE]:** "The next mud section was when it really split up. I reckoned that section when I arrived, and it was muddy after two days of no rain, so I knew it was one to watch. I took the grass, and the other girls took the mud and were stuck. But Gee is so good at mud she managed to come back to me." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/results-matt-beers-and-rosa-kloser-win-lauf-gravel-worlds-2025-in-a-duo-of-two-up-sprints/)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Colin Strickland [ELITE] (2017 Gravel Worlds Champion):** Used 700c x 32mm Teravail Rampart tires, deep section Enve wheels, aero bars, and a 50/34 (Rotor Q-Rings) double chainring crankset with a tight cassette. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-150-hot-miles-of-the-2018-gravel-worlds-and-about-87-hills-lincoln-nebraska-usa/)

**Amity Gregg [ELITE]:** Used ovalized 46/36 Q-Rings with a 2x double chainring crankset and tight cassette. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-150-hot-miles-of-the-2018-gravel-worlds-and-about-87-hills-lincoln-nebraska-usa/)

**JOM [ELITE]:** Ran Xentis Kappa2 650b 4-spoke carbon wheelset with WTB Resolute 650b x 42mm tires. Noted: "Both items were rolling fast and handled the loose stuff with ease." First race aboard 650b wheels. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-150-hot-miles-of-the-2018-gravel-worlds-and-about-87-hills-lincoln-nebraska-usa/)

**hubcyclist [COMPETITIVE]:** Warning about hydration packs: "I picked a bad time to try a new thing, a full camelback 3l, which I attribute to lower back pain I got about halfway through and really messed up my ability to keep on the power." (10-hour finisher perspective) (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/the-nebraska-garmin-gravel-worlds-2024-tell-me-about-it/95329)

**KCBikeNerd [COMPETITIVE]:** Planned to use aerobars and "put the stiffest elastomers in my new redshift stem" for the 150. (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/the-nebraska-garmin-gravel-worlds-2024-tell-me-about-it/95329)

**Dbecker27 [UNKNOWN]:** "i rode with my aero bars but i did the 300 miler so it was more spread out. Others can chime in but i would think you could probably skip putting them on [for the 150]." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/the-nebraska-garmin-gravel-worlds-2024-tell-me-about-it/95329)

**Trash_Panda [UNKNOWN]:** "I'd slap the aeros on. 150m is a long day just for the extra position. Probably be alone for a big part of it. If windy probably wish you had them." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/the-nebraska-garmin-gravel-worlds-2024-tell-me-about-it/95329)

**Rosa Kloser [ELITE]:** Credited SRAM Transmission system with allowing her to "push it in the mud without losing the derailleur" during crucial muddy sections. (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/results-matt-beers-and-rosa-kloser-win-lauf-gravel-worlds-2025-in-a-duo-of-two-up-sprints/)

**Note on double chainrings:** Elite riders Colin Strickland and Amity Gregg both used 2x double chainring setups, described as "further proof that 2x / double chainrings are far from dead." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-150-hot-miles-of-the-2018-gravel-worlds-and-about-87-hills-lincoln-nebraska-usa/)

## Weather Experienced

**2018 Gravel Worlds:** Predicted high of 88°F (31°C). Race report noted: "It was warm and relatively humid for this part of the world. Drip, drip, drip went the perspiration from the bill of my cap worn beneath my helmet. I'm used to sweating up a mess in humid North Central Florida, but I wasn't expecting to be this moist so early into the race." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-150-hot-miles-of-the-2018-gravel-worlds-and-about-87-hills-lincoln-nebraska-usa/)

**2024 Gravel Worlds:** Heat index was 105+ degrees. Competitor noted: "Omg it was so hot." Conditions included headwinds from mile 60-120. Weather forecast was severe enough that "most dropped to the 75 the week before due to the forecast" - original 300 registrants dropped to ~150 for the 150-mile event. (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/the-nebraska-garmin-gravel-worlds-2024-tell-me-about-it/95329)

**2025 Gravel Worlds:** "Overnight rains that soaked the dirt roads into soupy, sandy slog in most areas, and quite a few peanut butter mud sections that had riders hiking for long segments." The mud came after "two days of no rain" according to Rosa Kloser's pre-race recon. (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/results-matt-beers-and-rosa-kloser-win-lauf-gravel-worlds-2025-in-a-duo-of-two-up-sprints/)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Gravel surface quality:** "The gravel roads were in primo condition although one had to be mindful of the deep sections of gravel that proliferated some parts of the course." (2018) (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-150-hot-miles-of-the-2018-gravel-worlds-and-about-87-hills-lincoln-nebraska-usa/)

**Surface smoothness:** "The gravel is not chunky at all and smooth. Do be careful of the oncoming traffic on the gravel roads and also when descending there can be sections of soft gravel which can through you off line." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/the-nebraska-garmin-gravel-worlds-2024-tell-me-about-it/95329)

**Hill profile:** Approximately 87 hills along the 150-mile course. "You're going to be up and down over the whole course. None of the climbs are that big, but there are a ton of them." The climbs are described as "punchy" rather than long sustained grades. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-150-hot-miles-of-the-2018-gravel-worlds-and-about-87-hills-lincoln-nebraska-usa/)

**Minimum Maintained Roads (MMRs):** These unpaved, lesser-traveled sections are race-defining features. In 2025, MMRs were crucial attack points - "Swenson to go to the front and make his first big attack of the day" occurred on an MMR around 20 miles from the finish. The "last MMR road" was where final race-winning moves happened. (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/results-matt-beers-and-rosa-kloser-win-lauf-gravel-worlds-2025-in-a-duo-of-two-up-sprints/)

**Mud sections (2025):** The second MMR at ~30 miles was decisive: "at the end we made a split with six of us. I was really on the limit with my bike; I just made it out. I could see how packed my bike was with mud." One rider noted taking grass lines while others got stuck in mud. These early mud sections "detonated the pro field and forced splits early in the seven-plus hour race." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/results-matt-beers-and-rosa-kloser-win-lauf-gravel-worlds-2025-in-a-duo-of-two-up-sprints/)

**Loose gravel hazards:** On descents, "there can be sections of soft gravel" that can throw riders off line. (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/the-nebraska-garmin-gravel-worlds-2024-tell-me-about-it/95329)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Aid station decisions [ELITE level, 2025 race]:** At a crucial aid station in the 2025 race, leaders had to choose between stopping for water/fuel or carrying on. "Since Gravel Worlds is staunchly self-supported, there is no outside assistance and no handups. That means you must either start with everything you need or stop at the neutral aid stations." Six leaders (including Beers and Swenson) carried on without stopping, while three stopped. The gamble worked as the gap didn't last. (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/results-matt-beers-and-rosa-kloser-win-lauf-gravel-worlds-2025-in-a-duo-of-two-up-sprints/)

**Early race pacing [ELITE perspective]:** JOM noted in 2018: "Everyone who rolled past was riding too fast for my liking at this early juncture, which was most dissatisfying. My mind was willing but the legs had pressed the snooze button… they were dozy and unhappy about being awake this early." He noted his teammate K-Dogg was also a "fellow slow-starter." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-150-hot-miles-of-the-2018-gravel-worlds-and-about-87-hills-lincoln-nebraska-usa/)

**Mental pacing strategy [ELITE]:** "Riding a 150-mile / 240 kilometre gravel race is about metering one's effort in doses, and mentally breaking up the race into small manageable chunks. My Garmin may have read '200-something kilometres until the finish', but I think about the distance between now and the next point of interest." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-150-hot-miles-of-the-2018-gravel-worlds-and-about-87-hills-lincoln-nebraska-usa/)

**Heat management [COMPETITIVE, 10-13+ hour finisher perspective]:** KCBikeNerd in 2024: "Heat got me hard so I chilled for a while at a stop at mile 100 and 120 to cool down and catch up on hydration, electrolytes, and calories." Lessons learned included: "Next time more chamois cream. Small sunblock to reapply since I didn't get to til mile 100." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/the-nebraska-garmin-gravel-worlds-2024-tell-me-about-it/95329)

**Mud strategy [ELITE, 2025]:** Rosa Kloser's approach: "I reckoned that section when I arrived, and it was muddy after two days of no rain, so I knew it was one to watch. I took the grass, and the other girls took the mud and were stuck." Pre-race course reconnaissance of problem areas proved critical. (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/results-matt-beers-and-rosa-kloser-win-lauf-gravel-worlds-2025-in-a-duo-of-two-up-sprints/)

**Alliances [ELITE, 2025]:** Rosa Kloser on the 120-mile breakaway: "We actually talked after we made the split to commit to it together. Over such a long distance, you form an ally, so we agreed we'd sprint it out in the end." Similarly, Matt Beers and Keegan Swenson "seemed to form a loose alliance" before sprinting at the finish. (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/results-matt-beers-and-rosa-kloser-win-lauf-gravel-worlds-2025-in-a-duo-of-two-up-sprints/)

**Downhill speed management:** "Manage your speed on the downhills and you will be fine." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/the-nebraska-garmin-gravel-worlds-2024-tell-me-about-it/95329)

**Minimum pace requirement:** For the Gravel Adventure option, "Riders are expected to maintain a minimum average pace of 10 mph to ensure our support crews can reach their designated locations." (https://www.tourdenebraska.com/gravelroad-adventure.html)

## DNF Risk Factors

**2024 heat-related DNFs [150-mile race]:** Approximately 1/3 of the 150-mile field DNF'd due to extreme heat (105+ heat index). Results showed "97/150 finished" - only 97 finishers from 150 starters. One rider noted: "It pretty much slaughtered the mid/tail end of the 'party pace' folks just wanting to complete it." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/the-nebraska-garmin-gravel-worlds-2024-tell-me-about-it/95329)

**Last-minute distance changes (2024):** Weather forecast was severe enough that "most dropped to the 75 [mile event] the week before due to the forecast." Original registration of 250-300 dropped to ~150 starters for the 150-mile event. (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/the-nebraska-garmin-gravel-worlds-2024-tell-me-about-it/95329)

**Mud-related mechanicals and splits (2025):** The early mud sections "detonated the pro field and forced splits early in the seven-plus hour race." Elite riders like Lauren Stephens, Morgan Aguirre, Sofia Gomez Villafañe, and Lauren De Crecenzo were "minutes back" after just 25 miles due to mud sections. Matt Beers "got caught out in the first mud section pretty bad, and I had to bridge up through three groups." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/results-matt-beers-and-rosa-kloser-win-lauf-gravel-worlds-2025-in-a-duo-of-two-up-sprints/)

**Derailleur failures in mud:** Rosa Kloser specifically mentioned the advantage of SRAM Transmission: "Due to the SRAM Transmission system, I could push it in the mud without losing the derailleur" - implying this is a common failure point for others. (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/results-matt-beers-and-rosa-kloser-win-lauf-gravel-worlds-2025-in-a-duo-of-two-up-sprints/)

**Mechanicals from cattle guards (2025):** Cecile Lejeune "was beset by a mechanical spurred on by a cattle guard" while chasing the lead women. (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/results-matt-beers-and-rosa-kloser-win-lauf-gravel-worlds-2025-in-a-duo-of-two-up-sprints/)

**Early flats:** KCBikeNerd experienced a "Flat at mile 30 that was a pain to fix" in 2024. (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/the-nebraska-garmin-gravel-worlds-2024-tell-me-about-it/95329)

**Finish rate trends:** 2024 finish rate (overall, all distances) was "better for 2024 than recent prior years" despite the extreme heat, but registration had "collapsed, especially for Women" compared to 2022. (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/the-nebraska-garmin-gravel-worlds-2024-tell-me-about-it/95329)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Tour de Nebraska (non-race touring event):** Described as having a "family reunion on wheels" atmosphere. "The TDN is like a family reunion on wheels!" Limited to 500 riders "which allows for meaningful interaction between riders and the quaint communities we visit." Overall rider satisfaction: 4.7 stars. (https://www.tourdenebraska.com/)

**Tour de Nebraska pace and vibe:** "You are truly on your own—no schedules, no deadlines, and no kids (unless you want to bring them)! All you have to do is pedal and enjoy the amazing scenery." Daily mileage ranges from 45-70 miles over five days. (https://www.tourdenebraska.com/)

**Gravel Worlds start time:** "The most surreal of them all is the pre-dawn start. While many gravel races roll off the line at sunrise, none of the big gravel prizes start before the sun beyond Gravel Worlds. With a crisp 5:55 AM start for the men, there is a full hour of racing before the sun emerges over the rolling fields of corn stalks, barns, and trees of eastern Nebraska." Women started at 6:05 AM. (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/results-matt-beers-and-rosa-kloser-win-lauf-gravel-worlds-2025-in-a-duo-of-two-up-sprints/)

**Pre-race socializing:** "Thursday evening around 6pm, it [SchillingBridge Cork and Tap House] played host to a meet and greet for attendees of Gravel Worlds. Naturally, I attended for socializing and a beer, and mostly to meet Corey and Craig, the lads behind Gravel Worlds and the Pirate Cycling League – arguably the best cycling league around." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-150-hot-miles-of-the-2018-gravel-worlds-and-about-87-hills-lincoln-nebraska-usa/)

**Aid station culture:** "You'll likely be offered a couple free hot dogs or brats along the way" at neutral aid stations. "Plenty of goo, cokes and other snacks at the aid stations." Race promoters noted as doing "a great job. You'll be well supported." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/the-nebraska-garmin-gravel-worlds-2024-tell-me-about-it/95329)

**Prize purse (2025 Lauf Gravel Worlds):** "$100,000 in total prizes up for grabs" with "$17,500 first-place prize purse in the single largest one-day prize purse in gravel." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/results-matt-beers-and-rosa-kloser-win-lauf-gravel-worlds-2025-in-a-duo-of-two-up-sprints/)

**Cycle Works expo:** The host shop "Cycle Works in Lincoln, the host shop for Gravel Worlds and the related expo. 'Twas basically an excuse for me to collect my race packet and socialize." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-150-hot-miles-of-the-2018-gravel-worlds-and-about-87-hills-lincoln-nebraska-usa/)

**Local support:** Towns along the route like "Valparaiso and Malcolm, fixtures along the average Gravel Worlds route." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/race-report-150-hot-miles-of-the-2018-gravel-worlds-and-about-87-hills-lincoln-nebraska-usa/)

**Registration pricing concerns:** One rider noted "at the current reg price I wouldn't do it again, it was half as much when I did it" (comparing 2019 to later years). (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/the-nebraska-garmin-gravel-worlds-2024-tell-me-about-it/95329)

**Calendar positioning challenges:** Community discussion noted potential attendance decline due to "bad spot on the calendar" and that "SBT grvl was a week before, probably doesn't help since both are pricey." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/the-nebraska-garmin-gravel-worlds-2024-tell-me-about-it/95329)
