## 2. RACE HISTORY & FOUNDING

### Origins (1988)
- **Founded:** 1988 by Susan and Rich Rodenburg from Lincoln, Nebraska
- **Original Concept:** Susan Rodenburg recalls: "In 1988, sitting around with several of our friends, we came up with the idea of starting a 5-day circle tour and named it Tour de Nebraska, in homage to Tour de France."
- **First Year:** Started with just 11 riders
- **Current Size:** Has grown to over 400 cyclists annually, capped at 500

### Growth & Evolution
- Now in its 37th year (2025)
- Transitioned leadership to directors Charlie and Kim Schilling while maintaining founders' vision
- Evolved to include optional Gravel/Road Adventure component for gravel enthusiasts
- The "double format" (two nights in one town) was added by popular demand
- Became the signature fundraising event for Nebraska Trails Foundation

### Great Plains Gravel Heritage
Nebraska has become a significant destination in the American gravel cycling scene:
- **Gravel Worlds** (Lincoln, founded 2010): One of the most respected gravel events in the US, born from the "Good Life Gravel Adventure" (2008-2009)
- **USA Cycling Gravel National Championship**: Nebraska hosted the inaugural national championship
- **Solstice Gravel Grinder** (Beatrice): 10-year legacy event (2026 is final year)
- **BRAN (Bicycle Ride Across Nebraska)**: The state's cross-state tour now offers daily gravel options
- Nebraska is described as "gravel bike heaven" - once off main roads, virtually all roads are gravel

### The Nebraska Gravel Philosophy
The state embodies the grassroots ethos of gravel cycling:
- Self-supported adventure over rigid competition
- Community connection and small-town hospitality
- Exploring the "single-lane maintenance roads that make Nebraska gravel riding so special"
- "No categories, no officials, no prize money" - just riding

## 3. TERRAIN & COURSE

### Geographic Setting
- **2025 Host Communities:** Curtis, Elwood, Cambridge, McCook (Southwest Nebraska)
- **Format:** Circle tour starting and ending in Curtis
- **Daily Range:** 35-59 miles per day (optional 56-mile loop on Day 4)
- **Total:** 250+ miles over 5 days

### Surface Types

**Main Tour:**
- Mix of paved roads and gravel suitable for various bike types
- Most riders use multi-speed touring/racing bicycles
- Hybrids, tandems, mountain bikes, recumbents, and e-bikes all welcome

**Gravel Adventure Component:**
- Single-lane maintenance roads
- Well-worn dirt paths
- Fresh gravel sections (can be challenging)
- Minimum maintenance roads (MMR)

### Nebraska Gravel Characteristics (General)
- **Surface Variability:** Roads vary from well-worn dirt to fresh loose gravel
- **Sandy Sections:** Especially in Sandhills regions, roads can turn sandy
- **Peanut Butter Effect:** Soil in some areas turns to thick, sticky mud when soaked
- **Quick Drying:** Roads dry extremely quickly after rain
- **Washboarding:** Common on high-traffic gravel roads
- **Thorns:** Ever-present hazard requiring puncture protection
- **Minimum Maintenance Roads:** May be earth or turf covered, with no snow plowing or surfacing required by county

### Terrain Profile
- Despite "flat Nebraska" stereotype, the region has constant rolling hills
- "Hill after hill after hill" - no single killer climb but persistent undulation
- Challenging climbs noted along Middle Creek Road and West Lake Drive
- Views include historic points of interest, century-old township cemeteries, and classic Nebraska farmland

### Tire Recommendations (for gravel sections)
- Minimum 35mm tires for gravel routes
- 700x45 or bigger preferred for sandy sections
- Local riders often run 2.1" on 650b or 2.3" on 29er wheels
- Tubeless highly recommended due to thorn prevalence
- Consider slime tubes or tire inserts as backup

## 4. WEATHER

### June Climate in Nebraska

**Temperature:**
- Average high: 81-85°F (27-29°C)
- Average low: 55-65°F (13-18°C)
- Heat index can reach 86°F (30°C) with humidity
- Occasional hot spells to 100°F (38°C) possible

**Precipitation:**
- June is the wettest month in Nebraska
- Average 15.9 rain days accumulating 3.86" (98mm)
- Afternoon thunderstorms always a possibility
- Rainfall varies - eastern Nebraska wetter than west

**Wind:**
- Moderate wind conditions in June (between spring peak and summer calm)
- Wind-swept open plains are characteristic
- No mountain barriers create constant wind exposure
- "Ever-present wind" is a defining feature

**Daylight:**
- Approximately 15 hours and 6 minutes of daylight in June
- Longest days of the year for maximum riding time

**Additional Considerations:**
- Thunderstorm and tornado season begins in May - weather monitoring essential

- Always bring rain gear - weather changes quickly

### Weather Impact on Gravel Conditions
- **Rain:** Can create sticky "peanut butter" mud on certain soil types
- **Post-Rain:** Roads typically dry very quickly
- **Sandhills Bonus:** Recent rain actually firms up sandy sections, making them easier to ride
- **Heat + Humidity:** Combined with wind exposure can be challenging

## 5. FORUM INSIGHTS & TESTIMONIALS

### Official Testimonials (from Tour de Nebraska website)

**Organization & Professionalism:**
> "This was the most expertly organized ride we've ever been on! The friendly, accommodating crew, fun breweries, good food and gorgeous camping spots were second to none!"

**Community & Social Experience:**
> "I enjoy the camaraderie among the cyclists. It's always fun to see familiar faces and catch up, and I love that I meet interesting people whose paths I'd never have crossed otherwise. Sharing the joys and the miseries of long rides brings people together."

> "Tour de Nebraska is like a big, rolling, family reunion. TDN has a welcoming, fun culture and is a perfect ride for first-time, multi-day tourists."

**Accessibility:**
> "TdN turned out to be the perfect experience for someone that has not done a multi-day ride."

**The Surprise Factor:**
> "Enjoyable route - I didn't know Nebraska is hilly."

**Logistics Advantage:**
> "The beginning and ending at same town makes logistics much simpler than BRAN. Two nights at each town made breaking camp much easier too."

**Route Quality:**
> "The roads were fantastic, few cars, beautiful sights. There were few enough participants that I saw people repeatedly and could make new friends, which is sooo much better than a giant ride."

### Gravel-Specific Insights (from Nebraska gravel cycling community)

**Road Conditions:**
> "Many of these roads will be well-worn, nearly dirt paths, while other roads may have fresh gravel making travel difficult."

**Sandhills Reality:**
> "Especially in the sandhills, the unpaved roads in Nebraska can be mighty unpredictable, from wash-outs to sandy soil, and the ever-present thorns."

**Self-Sufficiency:**
> "Riders are advised to bring all the food and water they need for an entire ride as resupply options can be limited in rural areas."

### TrainerRoad Forum Discussion (Gravel Worlds context)
- Mixed reports on course difficulty: "There have been mixed reports about it being fast, but then also slow and harder than Unbound 200"
- Nebraska's reputation for challenging conditions despite appearing "flat" on paper

### Reddit
- Limited specific Tour de Nebraska discussion found
- General Nebraska gravel cycling content suggests strong community support
- Recommend checking r/gravelcycling for firsthand reports

## 6. BLACK PILL - Honest Truths

### What You Need to Know

**1. This is NOT a Race**
- Tour de Nebraska is explicitly a supported tour, not a gravel race
- Minimum pace requirement of 10 mph for support logistics
- If you want competitive gravel racing, look at Gravel Worlds instead
- The gravel component is limited to just 30 spots as an optional add-on

**2. Distance Reality**
- Daily distances are relatively modest (35-59 miles)
- This is designed for recreational cyclists and first-timers
- Experienced gravel racers may find the mileage underwhelming
- The 250+ mile total is spread over 5 days

**3. Location Remoteness**
- Southwest Nebraska is genuinely remote
- McCook is 284 miles from Omaha (4.5 hour drive)
- McCook is 255 miles from Denver (4.5 hour drive)
- Limited commercial flight options (McCook Regional is a small regional airport)
- This is not a destination with entertainment options - you come for the ride and community

**4. Nebraska Gravel Challenges**
- Thorns are ubiquitous - tubeless or sealant mandatory
- Fresh gravel can be loose and slow
- Sandy sections require wider tires than typical gravel
- Wind exposure is constant on the open plains
- Very limited cell service in rural areas
- Few resupply options between towns

**5. Weather Unpredictability**
- June brings thunderstorm risk
- Tornado season is active
- Heat and humidity can combine for oppressive conditions
- Rain can turn roads to sticky mud quickly
- No shade or shelter on most routes

**6. The "Flat Nebraska" Misconception**
- Locals are quick to correct this: Nebraska is NOT flat
- Constant rolling terrain with no flat sections to recover
- No big climbs but "hill after hill after hill"
- Cumulative elevation can be significant

**7. Limited Gravel Adventure Spots**
- Only 30 spots for the gravel component
- First-come, first-served registration
- May require early commitment before full route details known

**8. Support Expectations**
- Oasis points every 10 miles for gravel adventure
- But you must maintain 10 mph pace or support may not be where you expect
- This is more supported than pure gravel racing but less than full SAG every mile

**9. Cost Considerations**
- Registration fee (amount not publicly stated but multi-day supported tours typically run $300-500+)
- Food budget: ~$250 for meals over 5 days
- Lodging/camping: Most camp at provided sites
- Travel: Significant driving from any major airport
- May need gear suitable for both camping and gravel

**10. Audience Fit**
- Perfect for: Multi-day tour newbies, social cyclists, those wanting supported adventure
- Less ideal for: Competitive gravel racers, those seeking pure bikepacking challenge, riders wanting big daily mileage
