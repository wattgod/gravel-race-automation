## FORUM INSIGHTS

### Training Recommendations
- This is NOT recommended as first bikepacking ultra
- Multi-day shakedown rides essential (1,000km trips recommended)
- Test loaded bike setup, food, and water plans
- Altitude acclimatization important
- Training should include 12-15 hour riding days
- Keep training fun - it's "ultimately just a game"
- Focus on saddle time over specific training plans
- Varied conditions and loaded riding recommended

### Mental Preparation
- "For most people, the Tour Divide is more of a mental battle than a physical one"
- Fear prevents many from starting; some quit midway due to fear
- Visualization exercises recommended:
  - Imagine riding alone in rain
  - Walking through mud
  - Resupplying efficiently
  - Mental journey to finish
- Be prepared to be beaten down, cold, wet, injured, alone, scared, dehydrated, dealing with mechanicals
- Confidence wanes; riders beat themselves up over small mistakes
- Enthusiasm and pessimism ebb and flow with calorie intake

### Gear Philosophy
- "Packing your fears" is common trap (over-packing food/water)
- Balance weight vs. durability
- Test contact points (saddle, grips, pedals) extensively
- What works for 5 hours may not work for 15 hours
- If item unused for a week, mail it home from next post office

### Race Pace Reality
- Riders typically need 12-15 hours in the saddle daily
- "Brutal" daily mileage requirements
- "Over days in the saddle, weird things can happen to your body"
- Front runners: 3-4 hours sleep per night
- Mid-pack racers: 4-6 hours sleep more common
- Average racer: ~3 weeks to finish

### Community Notes
- "The camaraderie and fellowship among the bikepacking community is rich"
- Experienced riders helpful with gear and preparation advice
- BIKEPACKING.com and bikepacking.net forums recommended over MTBR

## BLACK PILL (Harsh Realities)

### Attrition & Failure Rates
- **47-60% DNF rate** (varies by year)
- Only ~716 riders have ever completed the race (since 2008)
- 2010 example: 48 started, 24 finished (50% attrition)
- Heart-breaking attrition driven primarily by daily mileage demands

### Common Reasons for DNF
1. Physical breakdown/injury
2. Mental defeat
3. Mechanical failures beyond repair
4. Weather (impassable snow, mud, flooding)
5. Illness/dehydration
6. Family emergencies
7. Equipment failure
8. Fear

### Physical Toll - What Breaks

**Feet:**
- Significant swelling (despite buying wide/comfortable shoes)
- Loss of feeling in toes - can last months (one racer: 1 month all toes, 4 months big toes)
- Advice: buy shoes 0.5-1 full size larger

**Hands:**
- Loss of grip strength reported
- Numbness common

**Overall:**
- Altitude sickness
- Poor food/water management compounds issues
- Huge blisters from hike-a-bike
- Tired legs, aching backs, pounding heads
- Loaded bikes heavier than expected

### Mechanical Failures
- Something WILL go wrong on 13-30 day race
- Common issues:
  - Seatpost clamp loosening
  - Hub failures (catastrophic)
  - Derailleur damage
  - Wheel/tire destruction
  - Pedal breakage
  - Bottom bracket seizure
  - Spoke breakage
- The GDMBR is "extremely hard on equipment"
- Weight of gear multiplies stress on components

### Gearing Mistakes
- Wrong gearing forces complete race strategy change
- Example: 34x17 (2:1 ratio) proved too hard for one rider

### Mud Reality
- Rear tire can seize instantly
- Some riders seem to collect mud faster than others
- Following another rider's line may not work

### Time Management Traps
- Restaurant meals: time sink
- Laundry: only do if you can sleep during
- Multiple store stops: wasted time
- Hotel check-in process: consider bivvy instead

### Hike-a-Bike Reality
- Not technically difficult but well-documented sections exist
- Weather/mud can turn ANY dirt section into hike-a-bike
- Koko Claims right at start
- Fleecer Ridge descent
- Various Montana sections in wet conditions

### Wildlife Risks
- Grizzly bear territory: Pinedale, WY north through Canada
- Bear spray essential
- Bluff charges reported (bears within 50 ft)
- Bears waking sleeping riders reported
- Black bears throughout route
- Reality: injury/death from wildlife "virtually zero" but encounters happen

### Environmental Dangers (Ranked by Actual Risk)
1. Drive to/from trailhead (highest actual risk)
2. Trips, sprains
3. Hypothermia
4. Lightning (especially San Juans above treeline)
5. Dehydration/heat exhaustion

## LOGISTICS

### Pre-Race Preparation

**Route Research:**
- Verify resupply locations and hours
- Include vital info on printed elevation profile
- Keep it simple but thorough

**Shakedown Rides:**
- Essential for success
- Test loaded setup, handling, rattles, rubs
- Identify what doesn't work before race
- Untested setup leads to unnecessary stress

**Gear Preparation:**
- Balance weight vs durability
- Ensure even distribution for stability/control
- Verify bottle mounts secure (fork/downtube prone to falling)
- Test contact points extensively
- Resolve all doubts before start

### Resupply Strategy

**General Approach:**
- Resupply opportunities in ~20 small towns
- Spaced every 100-200 miles
- Racing limits thorough planning - may cause shortages
- Touring allows more comprehensive planning

**Food Strategy:**
- Don't overpack (packing fears)
- Waterproof notebook with high-energy food list
- Keep simple: glance at list, grab what needed, roll out
- Binge at cafes/mini-marts
- Carry Snickers bars and hand foods for riding
- 16 hours in saddle daily leaves little time for elaborate meals

### Major Resupply Towns (North to South)

**Canada:**
- Banff (bike shops, full services)
- Elkford, Sparwood (lodging, food, basic services)
- Fernie (good value hostels, less touristy than Banff)

**Montana:**
- Whitefish (Glacier Cyclery - excellent bike shop, staging area)
- Helena (state capital, ~40k population, small-town feel)
- Butte (blue-collar mining town)

**Wyoming:**
- Pinedale ("All the civilization you need" - authentic cow town)
- Rawlins

**Colorado:**
- Steamboat Springs (can be expensive/booked)
- Breckenridge/Frisco/Silverthorne (expensive/booked)
- Salida
- Del Norte (Gary and Patti offer basic bike repair, camping)

**New Mexico:**
- Grants (large grocery store)
- Pie Town (Toaster House donation hostel, famous pie)
- Silver City (large grocery store)
- Antelope Wells (NO services - just border crossing)
- Columbus, NM (alternate endpoint with services)

### Towns with Large Grocery Stores
- Helena, Butte, Rawlins, Breckenridge/Frisco, Grants, Silver City

### Bike Shop Support
- Banff: Snowtips-Bactrax recommended
- Whitefish: Glacier Cyclery (extensive Divide experience)
- Other larger towns have shops but availability varies

### Long Stretches Without Services
- Flathead Valley (Montana)
- Great Basin: Rawlins to Atlantic City (100+ miles)
- Polvadera Mesa (New Mexico)
- Abiquiu NM to Platoro CO
- Silver City to Antelope Wells (123 miles)

### Water Considerations

**Great Basin (Wyoming):**
- 100+ miles with virtually no natural water
- Diangus Well: single 2" pipe, 20 miles outside Atlantic City
- Easy to miss, in cattle pasture
- Must filter AND treat water
- Next 80 miles: absolutely no water sources
- Reservoir at 100-mile mark (off-route option)
- Alkaline water in most natural sources - not drinkable

**New Mexico:**
- Much drier terrain
- Water sources few and far between
- Carry water for several days at a time

### Sleep Strategy

**Racing Approach:**
- Serious racers: 2-3 hours sleep most nights + power naps
- Even less sleep first and last days
- Front runners: 3-4 hours/night typical

**Mid-Pack Approach:**
- 4-6 hours sleep more sustainable
- One racer averaged 6 hours = "barely enough to recover"

**Bivvy vs Hotels:**
- Bivvy/wild camping saves significant time
- No check-in process, find spot anywhere
- Official campgrounds have hotel disadvantages without benefits
- Wild camping: find spot within 5-10km of looking
- Equipment: Bivvy bag (like OR Helium) quicker than small tent

### Direction Choice

**Southbound (SOBO - Grand Depart Standard):**
- Start June, race weather through Montana
- Hit New Mexico before worst monsoon season
- Majority of racers go this direction
- Weather gets warmer as you progress

**Northbound (NOBO):**
- Best May-June to avoid southern heat
- Wait for northern snow/mud to dry
- Weather gets colder as you progress
- Add extra layers along the way
- Add bear spray when entering grizzly territory
