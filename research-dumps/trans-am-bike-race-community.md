# TRANS AM BIKE RACE — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Mike Hall [ELITE]:** Finished the inaugural 2014 Trans Am in 17 days and 16 hours, averaging almost 400 km per day. Hall was also the organizer of The Transcontinental Race and stated about ultra-endurance racing: "Nothing that's worth anything is ever easy." (https://ridefar.info/2019/11/trans-am-bike-race-2014-15-16/)

**Lael Wilcox [ELITE]:** Won the 2016 race in 18 days and 10 minutes, becoming the first American and first woman to win. "I learned a lot during this race. I hadn't done much road riding and I really had to step up my game out there. My biggest challenge was riding flats. I've spent a lot of time in the mountains and climbing comes naturally to me. Keeping a quick pace on flat terrain was tough." She averaged 235 miles per day and slept 3-5 hours per night. In the final two nights, she rode over 400 miles in about 33 hours. (https://bikepacking.com/plog/lael-wilcox-trans-am/)

**Lael Wilcox [ELITE] on encountering the leader:** When she caught Steffen Streich riding backwards in the final hours, "Steffen suggested that they ride to the finish together and share the victory, to which she said 'No way, this is a race.'" (https://ridefar.info/2019/11/trans-am-bike-race-2014-15-16/)

**Sofiane Sehili [ELITE]:** "You may think that the Trans Am Bike Race is pretty straightforward, given that it's all paved, it doesn't have much elevation gain, and there are no big gaps between resupplies. But the crosswinds I experienced in Kansas for two whole days turned out to be one of the biggest tests of my mental fortitude. After one day of riding between 15 and 18 kph (9 and 11 mph) on flat paved roads, I got in my sleeping bag and curled up in a ball for eight hours, not willing to go back to the battlefield. The idea of fighting the wind for another day was one I could not bear… That stretch of godforsaken land and the constant 40 kph winds blowing in my face destroyed me mentally." (https://stories.strava.com/articles/the-worlds-most-challenging-on-road-bikepacking-races)

**Leah Goldstein [ELITE]:** Placed 3rd overall and 1st female in 2024 at age significantly older than top finishers (first place was 21, second was 24). "I lost multiple days because of ignorance, not knowing my mechanics. I use Di2 electronic shifting, and I had so many mechanical issues that, really, if I had understood the system, I could have fixed it on the spot. But, instead, I wasted time. One day, I spent eight hours sitting in a bike shop for these mechanics, trying to figure it out. It was just simply a disconnected wire." (https://www.roadbikerider.com/leah-goldstein-trans-am-race/)

**Leah Goldstein [ELITE] on equipment failures:** "I had about 12 punctures that could have easily been avoided using tubeless tires. Like a little thorn would cause a flat and I'm changing it. I was down to my last tube, which wasn't seated properly, so I rode for 25 hours with a little bump... My tire selection was so tight that I had to use metal levers to take my tire off in Colorado. As a result, I cracked the wheel. Yeah, I cracked the carbon and rode with the cracked wheel from Colorado to Virginia." (https://www.roadbikerider.com/leah-goldstein-trans-am-race/)

**Michael Rushton [COMPETITIVE]:** A father of 10 and vegan triathlete who was among early leaders in his year. "I had some stomach problems going into the race, a little flu. I was consuming very few calories and was suffering from dry heaves, heartburn, nausea, belching, hiccups that would just get worse everytime I ate, especially in the aerobars. I kept thinking that it would get better if I could just stay on the bike. It didn't." He withdrew after four days in Dillon, Montana. "After one day of riding... with much difficulty could only keep a few thousand calories down, so I officially sent in my notice to withdraw." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-culture/photo-gallery-breaking-records-at-the-2018-trans-am-ultra-endurance-race)

**Peter Andersen [COMPETITIVE]:** The 50-year-old Californian finished 2018 in 16 days, 20 hours and 41 minutes, breaking the previous record by more than 12 hours. In 2017, he had been at the front early but ended as lantern rouge after winding up in hospital with pneumonia, then restarted his ride after recovery. "From the very back to the front of the field in one year; an impressive turnaround indeed." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-culture/photo-gallery-breaking-records-at-the-2018-trans-am-ultra-endurance-race)

**Sarah Hammond [ELITE] on navigation issues:** Lost significant time in Montana near Wisdom, an area noted as problematic for leading females. "It all started to go wrong for Hacker at Lost Trail Pass and then a series of backtracks and wrong turns turned what should have been a simple couple of hours of riding into Wisdom into a 16-hour ordeal." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-culture/photo-gallery-breaking-records-at-the-2018-trans-am-ultra-endurance-race)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Lael Wilcox [ELITE] setup for 2016 win:**
- Bike: Specialized Ruby Pro Disc UDi2 (women's specific endurance road bike with disc brakes)
- Wheels: Custom Specialized CLX64 dynamo front wheel with deep rims for aerodynamics, tubeless ready
- Tires: Tubeless setup
- Shifting: Di2 electronic (but battery life was shorter than expected - needed charging every 800 miles)
- Luggage: Revelate bags with stylized US flag on framebag
- Navigation: Carried backup navigation device
- Sleep: Used bivvy (large emergency garbage bag design), no tent or sleeping bag. Slept in churches and motels
- Strategy: "Doesn't stop for sit-down meals - she buys food to take away and eats on the bike... doesn't stay in motels; Lael camps out every night"
(https://bikepacking.com/plog/lael-wilcox-trans-am/ and https://www.curvecycling.com/blogs/news/117931781-trans-am-bike-race-2016-womens-race-preview)

**Leah Goldstein [ELITE] 2024 setup and lessons learned:**
- Bike: KHS Bicycles Flite racing bike with TT cockpit added for aero position
- Tires: Kendal 30mm with tubes - "This was a mistake; I should have gone tubeless. I had about 12 punctures that could have easily been avoided"
- Shifting: 12-speed Di2 - "I was afraid of using the electronic system because something might go wrong... I have to be a little more knowledgeable about the system"
- Weight: Estimates bike weighed about 5 lbs heavier than competitors due to overpacking. Carried 15-16 lbs of gear including clothes, navigation, charging devices, food, water
- Major issue: "My tire selection was so tight that I had to use metal levers to take my tire off in Colorado. As a result, I cracked the wheel"
- Di2 battery: Needed charging about every 800 miles
- Navigation: Garmin device, but had issues with satellite acquisition in bad spots
- Self-assessment: "This was my first time doing an unsupported race, so I completely over packed"
(https://www.roadbikerider.com/leah-goldstein-trans-am-race/)

**Sarah Hammond [ELITE] 2016 setup:**
- Bike: Curve Cycling Belgie - Titanium Road Bike
- Luggage: Apidura and Revelate
- Supporters: Jaggad, Spinroom, Curve Cycling, 4SHAW, SP Dynamo
(https://www.curvecycling.com/blogs/news/117931781-trans-am-bike-race-2016-womens-race-preview)

**Michael Rushton [COMPETITIVE] gear choice regret:**
"If he does it again, he'll opt for a gear ratio more suited to climbing, especially as problems getting into his rear cog made the climbing 'doable but difficult.'" (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-culture/photo-gallery-breaking-records-at-the-2018-trans-am-ultra-endurance-race)

**Velomobile performance [ELITE category]:**
In 2018, Marcel Graber finished in a three-wheeled velomobile in 16 days, 6 hours and 40 minutes - more than a day faster than the previous two-wheeled record. The laid-back position with fairing proved "pretty well suited to the task at hand" especially on flats and descents, though questions arose about climbing capability. (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-culture/photo-gallery-breaking-records-at-the-2018-trans-am-ultra-endurance-race)

## Weather Experienced

**2016 conditions:**
- Kansas: Temperatures hit 110°F
- Colorado: 30-34°C (86-93°F)
- General: "The heat was not terrible in RAAM because I had a crew of nine people who could cool me down. But when you're on your own, all the water you have turns to tea in half an hour. And it's boiling tea."
- Missouri: "At one point, coming into Missouri, I started knocking on people's doors and asking them, 'Can I buy some water off you or use your hose?' so I could spray myself off."
(https://www.roadbikerider.com/leah-goldstein-trans-am-race/)

**General conditions noted:**
- Temperature in high 90s for several days reported
- Snow riding mentioned as possibility
- Torrential rain encountered by some riders

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Lael Wilcox [ELITE] on terrain progression:**
"The west is fairly easy with long gradual climbs. The east is incredibly hilly and steep. The race really changes after Kansas... My favorite state was Missouri. I had a great ride through Yellowstone and the Tetons. I liked the farm county in the brief section of Illinois and the open plains in Kansas were stunning."
(https://bikepacking.com/plog/lael-wilcox-trans-am/)

**Kentucky (Appalachians) specific hazards:**
"The climbs are insane. I was climbing this 14% grade, so I was out of the saddle with my head down. It's like 3:00 in the morning... At one point, I had to conserve my pepper spray. For some dogs, I would point it at them... I got chased through the whole state. Kentucky was my most feared of all the ten states... However, the drivers were more courteous and patient than any other place I'd ridden. When they passed, they would give me lots of room, and sometimes, going up these steep climbs, I would have six cars back and not one itty bitty honk."
(https://www.roadbikerider.com/leah-goldstein-trans-am-race/)

**Kansas wind challenges [ELITE rider experience]:**
Sofiane Sehili experienced crosswinds that reduced his speed to 15-18 kph (9-11 mph) on flat paved roads for two entire days, calling it "one of the biggest tests of my mental fortitude."
(https://stories.strava.com/articles/the-worlds-most-challenging-on-road-bikepacking-races)

**Remote sections:**
"There are many stretches where nothingness exists. You would have nothing for 100-150 miles. No stores or anything. So, you have to ensure you are fully loaded with water, food, and whatever it may be in those sections. There are also a lot of sections with no reception, too."
(https://www.roadbikerider.com/leah-goldstein-trans-am-race/)

**Navigation trouble spots:**
The area around Wisdom, Montana has been problematic for multiple leading riders. Sarah Hammond went astray there in 2016, and Tanja Hacker had a 16-hour ordeal with "a series of backtracks and wrong turns" that should have been "a simple couple of hours of riding."
(https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-culture/photo-gallery-breaking-records-at-the-2018-trans-am-ultra-endurance-race)

**Route statistics comparison to Tour de France:**
- Total length: 7,080 km vs Tour's 3,520 km
- Rest days: 0 vs Tour's 2
- Highest apex: 3,300 meters vs Tour's 2,200 meters
- Typical total time: 17-40 days vs Tour's 23 days
- 2015 winner's daily average: 370 km vs Tour's 170 km
(https://www.liveviewgps.com/blog/cyclists-tracked-2016-trans-bike-race/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Lael Wilcox [ELITE] strategy:**
- Averaged 235 miles per day over 18 days
- Slept 3-5 hours per night on average
- Final two nights: rode over 400 miles in about 33 hours (drastically reduced sleep)
- Never stops for sit-down meals: "buys food to take away and eats on the bike as she continues to ride"
- Camps out every night, doesn't use motels
- Time savings: "if you sit down for a meal, you've got to wait for service, look at a menu, order, wait for your meal, talk to the locals, eat, wait for your food to settle and then be on your way. That whole process takes time - much longer than most people think. Lael knows that and that's why she gains one or two hours every day on most racers. On the road that could mean an extra 25-50 km."
- Strategy shift: "I really hit my stride in Missouri when the terrain got tougher. I felt like I was always just hanging on, waiting for an opportunity. But I continued riding hard and I slowly gained ground."
(https://bikepacking.com/plog/lael-wilcox-trans-am/ and https://www.curvecycling.com/blogs/news/117931781-trans-am-bike-race-2016-womens-race-preview)

**Riding with partners [ELITE experience]:**
Lael Wilcox: "I rode about half of the route with Evan Deutsch. I've never ridden with anyone in a race before we kept leapfrogging each other for the first five days, our paces matched so well that we decided to ride together. It was really nice to have somebody to ride with through the nights and we kept each other in good spirits."
(https://bikepacking.com/plog/lael-wilcox-trans-am/)

**Mental approach [ELITE]:**
"Negativity will get you nowhere in these races. You have to keep a good attitude and deal with challenges as they arise... For the most part, I really enjoyed myself out there. I feel relaxed and happy."
(https://bikepacking.com/plog/lael-wilcox-trans-am/)

**When terrain matters [ELITE insight]:**
Sarah Hammond (known climber): "She'll do things in her way, learning as she goes. She's proven plenty of times that she's tough enough to deal with the suffering... Sarah loves climbing, but I don't think that's where her real strength lies. She's a far better time trialist than most people know. It's a talent that she's developed over time as an instructor at the Spin Room. I think Sarah will come into her own on the great plains. I suspect her pace through Eastern Colorado and Kansas will surprise a lot of people."
(https://www.curvecycling.com/blogs/news/117931781-trans-am-bike-race-2016-womens-race-preview)

**Race phases [ELITE experience]:**
Lael Wilcox on early race positioning: "To be honest, early on in the race I didn't feel like I was doing very well. The leaders were over a 100 miles ahead of me, maintaining a faster pace and sleeping less."
(https://bikepacking.com/plog/lael-wilcox-trans-am/)

**Diet challenges:**
Leah Goldstein (vegan): "It's primarily gas station food, or you get a Subway or McDonald's, which is hard for me because I'm vegan. It was horrible. You know, I think I had the worst diet ever. It was tough."
(https://www.roadbikerider.com/leah-goldstein-trans-am-race/)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Gastrointestinal issues [COMPETITIVE rider]:**
Michael Rushton withdrew after 4 days: "I had some stomach problems going into the race, a little flu. I was consuming very few calories and was suffering from dry heaves, heartburn, nausea, belching, hiccups... After one day of riding... with much difficulty could only keep a few thousand calories down."
(https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-culture/photo-gallery-breaking-records-at-the-2018-trans-am-ultra-endurance-race)

**Respiratory issues [ELITE patterns]:**
Peter Andersen ended up in hospital with pneumonia during his 2017 attempt. Lael Wilcox has had breathing issues in other ultra-endurance events including Tour Divide and Arizona Trail Race.
(https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-culture/photo-gallery-breaking-records-at-the-2018-trans-am-ultra-endurance-race and https://www.curvecycling.com/blogs/news/117931781-trans-am-bike-race-2016-womens-race-preview)

**Mechanical knowledge gaps [ELITE rider affected]:**
Leah Goldstein: "I lost multiple days because of ignorance, not knowing my mechanics... One day, I spent eight hours sitting in a bike shop for these mechanics, trying to figure it out. It was just simply a disconnected wire. It happened when my brake fell off... The bike takes a beating. My shifter and brake fell off, and when my brake fell off, it became unplugged from the Di2. I lost all my shifting capacity. The ride to the next bike shop was about 15 hours. I had no brake and no shifter for that duration."
(https://www.roadbikerider.com/leah-goldstein-trans-am-race/)

**Tire/tube issues:**
Leah Goldstein: "I had about 12 punctures that could have easily been avoided using tubeless tires." Also rode 25 hours with an improperly seated tube causing a bump.
(https://www.roadbikerider.com/leah-goldstein-trans-am-race/)

**Mental breakdown from conditions [ELITE rider]:**
Sofiane Sehili in Kansas winds: "After one day of riding between 15 and 18 kph on flat paved roads, I got in my sleeping bag and curled up in a ball for eight hours, not willing to go back to the battlefield."
(https://stories.strava.com/articles/the-worlds-most-challenging-on-road-bikepacking-races)

**Navigation errors:**
Multiple riders lost significant time near Wisdom, Montana. Tanja Hacker experienced a 16-hour ordeal from backtracks and wrong turns.
(https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-culture/photo-gallery-breaking-records-at-the-2018-trans-am-ultra-endurance-race)

**Race has claimed lives:**
"Tragically, ultra-endurance legend, Mike Hall, was killed by a motorist while riding the Indian Pacific Wheel Race in 2017." In 2018 Trans Am, "one rider is in hospital fighting through serious injuries." In 2017, another cyclist was killed on the same Kansas highway used in the race.
(https://stories.strava.com/articles/the-worlds-most-challenging-on-road-bikepacking-races, https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-culture/photo-gallery-breaking-records-at-the-2018-trans-am-ultra-endurance-race, and https://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/comments/8wov58/bicycle_racer_hit_from_behind_in_kansas_dies_he/)

**Dog attacks:**
Leah Goldstein: "At one point, I had to ride with the pepper spray in my hand constantly. I couldn't put it back in my pocket. I was being chased that often by really aggressive dogs. You'd be riding, and they would pop out of the bushes... there was big talk about the dangerous dogs in Kentucky... mostly pit bulls."
(https://www.roadbikerider.com/leah-goldstein-trans-am-race/)

**Wildlife encounters:**
Leah Goldstein was charged by a black bear at 3am while climbing a 14% grade in Kentucky. "A guy in the truck saw that he was charging me, so he hit the bear so hard that it tumbled right over the cliff."
(https://www.roadbikerider.com/leah-goldstein-trans-am-race/)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**No prize money philosophy:**
"No outside support. No drafting. No entry fee. No prize money" - the race emphasizes bragging rights over financial rewards. "Nothing is at stake except honor."
(https://www.bikingbis.com/2013/11/14/trans-am-bike-race-its-all-about-bragging-rights/ and https://stories.strava.com/articles/the-worlds-most-challenging-on-road-bikepacking-races)

**Women's increasing participation:**
2016 was noted as "even more exciting than it has been the previous two years. Why? – Because the usually male-dominated race has more females than before. And, to make things even more interesting, the GPS tracking devices are showing that the female participants are serious competition for male cyclists."
(https://www.liveviewgps.com/blog/cyclists-tracked-2016-trans-bike-race/)

**Gender performance revelation:**
After 2016: "This race, along with several other impressive performances by female riders in other races, made everyone in the community realize that females may not have any disadvantages in this type of racing. Despite the fact that women are very under-represented in numbers at the start line, the best females can compete with the best males and sometimes beat them all."
(https://ridefar.info/2019/11/trans-am-bike-race-2014-15-16/)

**Remembering fallen riders:**
Irish rider Donncha Cuttriss set up a memorial of flowers and cards on the route for all riders to sign in memory of Eric Fishbein, who was struck and killed by a vehicle while racing in a previous year.
(https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-culture/photo-gallery-breaking-records-at-the-2018-trans-am-ultra-endurance-race)

**Tracking and following:**
"Family members, friends, and anyone else who wants to keep track of the cyclists' progress can easily do so via global positioning systems (GPS.) Each rider has a GPS tracking device placed on his or her helmet, and real time feed provides live updates. Spectators can also stay connected by checking following the race on Twitter and Facebook."
(https://www.liveviewgps.com/blog/cyclists-tracked-2016-trans-bike-race/)

**Documentary film:**
The 2014 inaugural race was documented in "Inspired to Ride" by the team behind "Ride The Divide," featuring Mike Hall and Juliana Buhring prominently. The film is described as "brilliant, showing each competitors own story, their own trials and tribulations, as well as their lighter moments."
(https://jamesmackeddie.com/2015/11/14/the-trans-am-bike-race/ and https://ridefar.info/2019/11/trans-am-bike-race-2014-15-16/)

**Self-supported ethos:**
"Being self-supported or unsupported means that drafting is not allowed, receiving any form of support from other racers, friends, or family is not allowed; all food, accommodation, repairs, etc., must be purchased from commercial sources."
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans_Am_Bike_Race)

**Support network importance [ELITE experience]:**
About Sarah Hammond: "Sarah has a big support network in Melbourne, Australia. While the Trans Am race is a solo, unsupported mission, Sarah will not feel alone. She'll know that all of Melbourne's cycling community will be following online and that will keep her charging."
(https://www.curvecycling.com/blogs/news/117931781-trans-am-bike-race-2016-womens-race-preview)

**Race organization approach:**
Founded by Nathan Jones, who also participated in 2014, finishing 13th. Jones also rode Tour Divide in 2010 and 2011. Rider positions monitored via Trackleaders website. MTBcast handles call-ins from riders on the road.
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans_Am_Bike_Race and https://www.bikingbis.com/2013/11/14/trans-am-bike-race-its-all-about-bragging-rights/)

**Race evolution:**
As of 2023, Trans Am Bike Race became Trans Am Bike Nonstop, with organizers embracing "quieter roads" and designing the route "from the ground up to use lower traffic roads and bike paths."
