# TRANS IOWA — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Greg Gleason [ELITE]:** "It's like a train wreck in many ways. You can see the imminent disaster coming from a long ways off, the witnesses can't look away and the participants can't seem to escape it." (https://www.salsacycles.com/blogs/articles/trans-iowa-v12-the-big-easy)

**Greg Gleason [ELITE]:** "Sarah leaned over to me and said, 'Time to pick up the pace.' With that signal the race started. Our once social pace was now a full-on fast push forward, and it was stringing the peloton out over the dark gravel roads." (https://www.salsacycles.com/blogs/articles/trans-iowa-v12-the-big-easy)

**Greg Gleason [ELITE]:** "Not knowing where and how far the next convenience store was, I started planning when it would be best for Walter and me to knock on a farmhouse door and ask for water. In total, Walter and I stopped twice before sunset. The next convenience store ended up being 100-plus miles out." (https://www.salsacycles.com/blogs/articles/trans-iowa-v12-the-big-easy)

**Jeff Kerkove [ELITE]:** "I knew we had a hard event on our hands when I saw a top Wisconsin cyclist sitting quietly in a convenience store staring with eyes glazed over onto a slice of pizza covered in Cheetos. He didn't move. He didn't say a word. He just sat there and stared." (https://dirtscrolls.com/14951591-blast-from-the-past-trans-iowa-and-the-rise-of-gravel-grinders)

**Jeff Kerkove [ELITE]:** "Water usually signifies life. In Trans-Iowa it means things are going to be miserable. Extremely miserable." (https://dirtscrolls.com/14951591-blast-from-the-past-trans-iowa-and-the-rise-of-gravel-grinders)

**Jeff Kerkove [ELITE]:** "If it's not rain, it's wind. If it's not wind, it's a batch of crazy farm dogs. If it's not the dogs … then it's their owners in their busted-ass pick-up truck. Trans-Iowa might be one of the most unpredictable cycling events on the planet." (https://dirtscrolls.com/14951591-blast-from-the-past-trans-iowa-and-the-rise-of-gravel-grinders)

**Kate Ankofski [UNKNOWN]:** "I found I enjoyed riding at night, alone. It's so quiet, and there's no time to be afraid: you have to focus on pedaling up hills you can't see, guided solely by a few hundred lumens." (https://transiowa.blogspot.com/p/trans-iowa-stories.html)

**Kate Ankofski [UNKNOWN]:** "It was one of the most memorable sights of the race for me, a minor victory of sorts: No, I wasn't so far behind every last rider [on the B road mud section]." (https://transiowa.blogspot.com/p/trans-iowa-stories.html)

**Kate Ankofski [UNKNOWN]:** "My first time learning that people who seem 100 percent more confident than I am aren't necessarily mentally stronger. My first time learning how badly I want this." (https://transiowa.blogspot.com/p/trans-iowa-stories.html)

**Andy [UNKNOWN]:** "Greg? Can we stop for a potty break?" (About a mile out of Checkpoint 1 — illustrating rookie group dynamics) (https://www.bikeiowa.com/Blog/1568/trans-iowa-v11-recap)

**Guitar Ted/Mark Stevenson [ELITE/Race Director]:** "There is no 'Easy Button' when it comes to Trans Iowa. Everything is difficult." (https://transiowa.blogspot.com/)

**Guitar Ted [ELITE/Race Director]:** "Once you get halfway through, the rest is totally mental strength." (https://transiowa.blogspot.com/p/trans-iowa-faq.html)

**Dennis Grelk [ELITE], 2011 winner:** "It's like a train wreck in many ways. You can see the imminent disaster coming from a long ways off, the witnesses can't look away and the participants can't seem to escape it." (https://dirtscrolls.com/14951591-blast-from-the-past-trans-iowa-and-the-rise-of-gravel-grinders)

**Anonymous [UNKNOWN]:** Regarding TI v11 race recap: "Just when I thought my 382 mile gravel-grinder last June was one of the last ones on the bucket-list, I go up and sign up for Trans-Iowa V11." (https://www.bikeiowa.com/Blog/1568/trans-iowa-v11-recap)

**Anonymous [UNKNOWN]:** "There were two lines of racers. Lights from blinkies and headlights were everywhere as were puddles, dips and gravel piles. At some points it was like 'slinky' at rush hour where you have to stop really fast, then speed up really fast, an then repeat over and over." (https://www.bikeiowa.com/Blog/1568/trans-iowa-v11-recap)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Greg Gleason [ELITE]:** "Knowing the weather was going to be so nice I packed my bike lighter than I ever have for any of the three Trans Iowa's in which I have competed." (TI v12, favorable conditions) (https://www.salsacycles.com/blogs/articles/trans-iowa-v12-the-big-easy)

**Kate Ankofski [UNKNOWN]:** Kit for cold/wet conditions — "On the top, thin Smartwool long-sleeve baselayer, mid-weight Smartwool long-sleeve baselayer, Patagonia M-10 jacket. Windproof Buff around the neck, wool cap. On the bottom, Garneau shorts, Polartec fleece leggings, REI rain pants. Wool socks and Velocio winter shoe covers. Showers Pass gloves that I tore off a few miles in." She noted: "For the weather I did manage to ride through, my kit was perfect." (https://transiowa.blogspot.com/p/trans-iowa-stories.html)

**Kate Ankofski [UNKNOWN]:** "I also downed a GU and some water. I could feel the water starting to seep in and that extra barrier [latex medical gloves over cycling gloves under waterproof shells] really helps." (https://transiowa.blogspot.com/p/trans-iowa-stories.html)

**Anonymous [UNKNOWN]:** "I had devised a harness where I could carry my bike with ease and was eager to try it out. Although walking versus riding still sucked, the harness worked superbly!!" (For B-road portage sections) (https://www.bikeiowa.com/Blog/1568/trans-iowa-v11-recap)

**Anonymous [UNKNOWN]:** "I was also able to take a full frame bag to keep gear at my fingertips and the weight distribution low on the bike." (https://www.bikeiowa.com/Blog/1568/trans-iowa-v11-recap)

**Anonymous [UNKNOWN]:** "As funny as it may sound, I bought some dish-washing gloves at Walgreens. I thought they would be good for warmth and water-proof-ness in a time of need and they packed up into no space at all. I did NOT take them. I wish I would have." (TI v11, wet conditions) (https://www.bikeiowa.com/Blog/1568/trans-iowa-v11-recap)

**Anonymous [UNKNOWN]:** "Don't put shot-blocks in a plastic container. With the humidity, they get all melted/stuck together." (https://www.bikeiowa.com/Blog/1568/trans-iowa-v11-recap)

**Anonymous [UNKNOWN]:** "Wear rain pants if you got 'em. I had 'em, but did not want to stop to put them on. My legs were fine. It was the tights than allowed water to get into my shoes. My rain pants would have stopped that." (https://www.bikeiowa.com/Blog/1568/trans-iowa-v11-recap)

**Guitar Ted [ELITE/Race Director]:** Navigation requirements: "Riders must use a well calibrated computer, have a lighting system to read cues by, lighting to see down the road, and lighting to see road signs with. (Plus a red tail light!)" (https://transiowa.blogspot.com/p/trans-iowa-faq.html)

**Guitar Ted [ELITE/Race Director]:** On cue sheets: "By the way, they don't fare too well if they get wet. Just a tip for ya....." (https://transiowa.blogspot.com/p/trans-iowa-faq.html)

**Bike choices observed [UNKNOWN]:** "Most folks were on cross bikes, a few mountain bikes and two fat bikes." (TI v11) (https://www.bikeiowa.com/Blog/1568/trans-iowa-v11-recap)

## Weather Experienced

**TI v12 (2016) [ELITE source]:** "The most significant element of this year's event was the weather: 70 degrees, partly sunny days, nighttime temps in the 50s, and 15-20 mph southeast winds. The gravel was 100 percent dry, and B-roads were mostly dry: Perfect conditions." Greg Gleason noted: "This year's Trans Iowa will go down in the record books as maybe the easiest (a relative term) in the history of the event." 55% finish rate vs. typical 15-20%. (https://www.salsacycles.com/blogs/articles/trans-iowa-v12-the-big-easy)

**TI v11 (2015) [UNKNOWN source]:** "It called for rain on Friday (before the race) and Saturday with clear skies on Sunday. On Friday the forecast turned for the worse and more rain and wind was predicted... That night it rained. And it rained some more... The race starts promptly at 4 am... There was no rain, but it was in the air. The temp was 38 degrees and wind was brisk and chilly." Mile 13: "This is when the rain started and the wind picked up... It was still pitch black out, and there were rivers of water along the sides of the gravel roads." (https://www.bikeiowa.com/Blog/1568/trans-iowa-v11-recap)

**TI v11 (2015) [UNKNOWN source]:** "We had a long stretch of side-wind and then an 8 mile stretch of head-wind... Our next stretch was 10 more miles of monsoon-like side-wind from the other side." Result: Only 1 rider (Greg Gleason) made the first checkpoint cutoff; all others DNF'd. "It was the shortest Trans Iowa to date." (https://www.bikeiowa.com/Blog/1568/trans-iowa-v11-recap)

**TI v7 (2011) [ELITE source]:** "Fortunately it didn't rain, but the previous days of wet weather did make things a bit gooey to start out with." Still had 76 starters and "Wet, seldom maintained 'B' roads forced riders to walk mile-long sections. Gusting winds and the never ending parade of steep hills knocked out 34 riders that couldn't reach the first checkpoint at mile 53 by 9:15 a.m." (https://dirtscrolls.com/14951591-blast-from-the-past-trans-iowa-and-the-rise-of-gravel-grinders)

**TI v13 (2017) [UNKNOWN source]:** Kate Ankofski: "I was exhausted from the four-hour rainy drive... At 2:45 a.m. my alarm went off. I had been wide awake, chilled and nauseous all night." Race conditions included B-road mud requiring portage. (https://transiowa.blogspot.com/p/trans-iowa-stories.html)

**Historical [ELITE source]:** "Heavy spring rains often turn the dirt roads into sticky, unrideable quagmires." Three Trans Iowas in seven years were stopped short due to weather. (https://dirtscrolls.com/14951591-blast-from-the-past-trans-iowa-and-the-rise-of-gravel-grinders)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Greg Gleason [ELITE]:** "With about 15 miles to go, I let Walter know we did this together, and we should share first place. After agreeing that was how we would finish, we realized we could maybe do it in a sub 24-hour time. Re-energized, we pushed hard against the clock, with Walter calling out every turn. In the dark, the last stack leading us to the bike path was sheltered by the wind. The streamer wasn't fluttering, and we missed our turn with 2 minutes to go! We finished together knuckle bumping in 24 hours and 1 minute." (TI v12 - navigation challenge at finish) (https://www.salsacycles.com/blogs/articles/trans-iowa-v12-the-big-easy)

**Greg Gleason [ELITE]:** "With 75 miles to go to the finish, Walter and I put on a couple of extra layers and headed back onto the dark windy gravel. As we got closer to Grinnell, and our finish, the landscape changed from rolling hills to steep, freshly graveled hilltops that headed directly into the south-east wind." (TI v12) (https://www.salsacycles.com/blogs/articles/trans-iowa-v12-the-big-easy)

**Guitar Ted [ELITE/Race Director]:** "Checkpoint 0 is the pre-race 'meat' up at the Grinnell Steakhouse. It's one of my favorite parts of Trans Iowa. It's the only time during the event you get to say hello to your entire TI Family. We eat a great meal, chat, hug, and take photos with our race numbers." (https://www.salsacycles.com/blogs/articles/trans-iowa-v12-the-big-easy)

**Anonymous [UNKNOWN]:** "As soon at my tires hit the gravel, you could feel them sink in. The road was super-saturated. I shifted a couple of gears down." (TI v11) (https://www.bikeiowa.com/Blog/1568/trans-iowa-v11-recap)

**Anonymous [UNKNOWN]:** On the B-road at mile 34 in TI v11: "There was one tire-track down the middle for about 30 feet (before it veered off into the ditch) and some footprints on each side... Sometime we could walk in the ditch, but other times there was a deep gully on one side and a steep hill on the other. The mud was slick and sticky. I lost one toe cover and right foot had at least 5 pounds of mud that worked its way into my shoe cover." (https://www.bikeiowa.com/Blog/1568/trans-iowa-v11-recap)

**Anonymous [UNKNOWN]:** "The Level B walk took the energy out of the legs, but it was light out and easier to see the road imperfections. We had 16 miles to go and only ONE hour before the cut-off. The roads were still mushy and we could only sustain 9-12 mph and even less up hills." (TI v11) (https://www.bikeiowa.com/Blog/1568/trans-iowa-v11-recap)

**Guitar Ted [ELITE/Race Director]:** "Terrain can vary from table top flat to insane gradients of more than 15% for up to a half mile or more. Most of the time, you'll either be going up or down, and doing that over and over, ad infinitum!" (https://transiowa.blogspot.com/p/trans-iowa-faq.html)

**Guitar Ted [ELITE/Race Director]:** Course composition: "Trans Iowa was conceived as a gravel road event... I will also throw in some 'B Maintenance Road', which is essentially just dirt road which can become unrideable when wet... Typically 90% or more of courses are dirt and gravel road." (https://transiowa.blogspot.com/p/trans-iowa-faq.html)

**Guitar Ted [ELITE/Race Director]:** "Most every Iowa gravel road has a 'street sign' on the corner of intersections. When this isn't the case, (Rare), we will mark a corner with flags." (https://transiowa.blogspot.com/p/trans-iowa-faq.html)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Greg Gleason [ELITE]:** At Checkpoint 1, 131 miles in, there were only three riders left in his group. He describes stopping at convenience stores to refuel: "Mountain Dew, fried pies, pizza, and topping off our water bottles, we did a quick stretch, and we were off again." Later strategy: "With about 15 miles to go, I let Walter know we did this together, and we should share first place." They finished in 24:01, the fastest TI completion time recorded. (https://www.salsacycles.com/blogs/articles/trans-iowa-v12-the-big-easy)

**Greg Gleason [ELITE]:** Early race pacing strategy (TI v12): "About a mile out of town one of the other riders rode up next to me: 'Greg? Can we stop for a potty break?' Laughing to myself I said, 'Sure. Why not?' I realized at that moment I was riding with a group of rookies, and they were all watching my every move. Once everyone had time to do what they needed, I announced it was time to go." (https://www.salsacycles.com/blogs/articles/trans-iowa-v12-the-big-easy)

**Guitar Ted [ELITE/Race Director]:** "Riders must maintain a distance covered per hour that is 10 miles or greater to reach the checkpoints and the finish line on time. (Note: I didn't say 'average speed', because it isn't about that. You must include all time spent- Riding time, mechanicals time, eating time, resting time, nature break time, and whatever. It has to be 10 miles covered on course per hour or greater. The more you stop, the less miles per hour you cover. Simple.)" (https://transiowa.blogspot.com/p/trans-iowa-faq.html)

**Kate Ankofski [UNKNOWN]:** "Because of my poor headlamp positioning, I couldn't read the cue card directions without stopping. Being a tad obsessive compulsive, sometimes I stopped multiple times to assure myself I was on the right track." (Navigation challenges affecting pacing) (https://transiowa.blogspot.com/p/trans-iowa-stories.html)

**Kate Ankofski [UNKNOWN]:** "In hindsight, I may have made it to the first checkpoint in time if I hadn't a.) taken so many pictures, b.) hadn't tried in vain to get concrete out of my cleats, which never clipped back in after that first bit of muck, and c.) hadn't called my mom while trekking up that B road." (https://transiowa.blogspot.com/p/trans-iowa-stories.html)

**Anonymous [UNKNOWN]:** TI v11 strategy notes: "I took LOTS of extra gear to the race and figured I would make some last minute decisions based on the last minute weather forecast. We also knew that convenience stores would be no further than 90 miles apart, so that meant carrying quite a bit of food and water too." (https://www.bikeiowa.com/Blog/1568/trans-iowa-v11-recap)

**TI v7 2011 [ELITE source]:** "A leading pair of riders were chased by a few others still hoping to win, trying to will their minds to stay on task and their bodies to fight through the immense suffering. Other riders were merely looking to finish. Just reaching the end would be counted as a victory." John Gorrilla led for 190 miles before five flats ended his race; Dennis Grelk won. (https://dirtscrolls.com/14951591-blast-from-the-past-trans-iowa-and-the-rise-of-gravel-grinders)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Kate Ankofski [UNKNOWN]:** "By this time it was nearing 8 a.m., fifteen minutes from the cutoff, and I was more than ten miles behind. Cell service was sporadic, as were clear intersections where I knew Heather Fisch could come find me. When I found one bar of service and an intersection with a grassy section at mile 33, I called it." (TI v13 - missed checkpoint by time/distance) (https://transiowa.blogspot.com/p/trans-iowa-stories.html)

**Anonymous [UNKNOWN]:** "Around mile 45, Andy had a sidewall blow out. We booted the tire (twice) but and lowered his pressure to under 30 psi just so it would not blow out again. Well.. it did at mile 46.5. Mile 47 approached and we saw Joe Stiller's Sprinter Van with a few folks standing in the road. Andy rode on his rim to the van and we stopped to see what was up. Joe (who was on a fat bike) had broken a crank and called in his ride. As soon as we stopped the wind made us all hypothermic." (TI v11 - mechanicals + weather = DNF) (https://www.bikeiowa.com/Blog/1568/trans-iowa-v11-recap)

**TI v11 (2015) [UNKNOWN source]:** First checkpoint cutoff was 8:30am at 53.49 miles. Only ONE rider (Greg Gleason) made it; 93 other racers did NOT make the cutoff. "The next guy arrived 10 minutes late and then a small pack was 15 minutes later. Most others turned around earlier after their dreams were shattered." (https://www.bikeiowa.com/Blog/1568/trans-iowa-v11-recap)

**TI v7 (2011) [ELITE source]:** "Wet, seldom maintained 'B' roads forced riders to walk mile-long sections. Gusting winds and the never ending parade of steep hills knocked out 34 riders that couldn't reach the first checkpoint at mile 53 by 9:15 a.m." Of 76 starters, only 18 finished. (https://dirtscrolls.com/14951591-blast-from-the-past-trans-iowa-and-the-rise-of-gravel-grinders)

**TI v7 (2011) [ELITE source]:** "Some riders would make navigational errors, causing them to have to retrace their steps back to a known point to get back on course. Even as race directors, my partner, David Pals, and I would often have to stop to try to understand the cues through our own sleep deprivation and confusing county road markers." (https://dirtscrolls.com/14951591-blast-from-the-past-trans-iowa-and-the-rise-of-gravel-grinders)

**TI v7 (2011) [ELITE source]:** "Darkness wasn't just falling on the Iowan landscape, but also within each remaining rider's mind. An internal battle raged within, calling them to quit the madness. Sleep deprivation set in, which only caused more confusion with navigation." (https://dirtscrolls.com/14951591-blast-from-the-past-trans-iowa-and-the-rise-of-gravel-grinders)

**TI v7 (2011) [ELITE source]:** "The main protagonist of the race, a former Trans Iowa winner named John Gorrilla, set an incessant pace. For 190 miles, the chasers tried in vain to track him down, but late in the event John started suffering flat tires. The chasers caught John, and eventually a fifth flat ended his hopes of winning another Trans Iowa." (https://dirtscrolls.com/14951591-blast-from-the-past-trans-iowa-and-the-rise-of-gravel-grinders)

**TI v14 (2018) [Race Results]:** 95 starters, 19 finishers (20% finish rate). Winner Luke Wilson finished at 8:50am Sunday morning. (https://transiowa.blogspot.com/)

**Corey "Cornbread" Godfrey [UNKNOWN]:** "Had his derailleur explode. He managed to limp back to Grinnell, find the local bike shop, get his bike converted to a single speed, and rejoined the race. He was out of contention for an official finish, but he wanted to see the course. So onward he went on his single gear." He finished over 310 miles. (TI v7) (https://dirtscrolls.com/14951591-blast-from-the-past-trans-iowa-and-the-rise-of-gravel-grinders)

**Guitar Ted [ELITE/Race Director]:** "I can't stress enough that the consistency is the key [in training]. Once the weather breaks, guys will start doing longer rides, refining gear choices, and working on nutrition that they can handle on longer rides. Things like lights, cue sheet holders, and coats, gloves, etc, are all figured out here." On DNF causes: "In a word? Mentality. If you don't possess that intangible mental capacity to ride beyond what your mind and body says is reasonable, then you won't finish." (https://transiowa.blogspot.com/p/trans-iowa-faq.html)

**Guitar Ted [ELITE/Race Director]:** "And then again, you could snap your derailleur off at Mile 60 and be done as well! Or have it pour down rain, and have the course and Nature shut you down. Trans Iowa is soooo unpredictable, that even if you come in with 100% physical and mental capacities, you still might not finish." (https://transiowa.blogspot.com/p/trans-iowa-faq.html)

**Historical context [ELITE source]:** Three Trans Iowas were called due to weather out of the first seven years. One Trans Iowa saw zero finishers. Typical finish rate: 15-20%; TI v12 (favorable conditions) saw 55% finish. (https://www.salsacycles.com/blogs/articles/trans-iowa-v12-the-big-easy)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Greg Gleason [ELITE]:** "Even though the weather was going to be so nice I packed my bike lighter than I ever have... I think this is only because of the long history of Trans Iowa being brutal, with really high attrition rates. Not sure what it was, but you could feel the tension." (TI v12 pre-race) (https://www.salsacycles.com/blogs/articles/trans-iowa-v12-the-big-easy)

**Greg Gleason [ELITE]:** "Checkpoint 0 is the pre-race 'meat' up at the Grinnell Steakhouse. It's one of my favorite parts of Trans Iowa. It's the only time during the event you get to say hello to your entire TI Family. We eat a great meal, chat, hug, and take photos with our race numbers. It's so much fun getting caught up with everyone and meeting all the rookie riders." (https://www.salsacycles.com/blogs/articles/trans-iowa-v12-the-big-easy)

**Greg Gleason [ELITE]:** "Sharing my day, night, and race with Walter made this Trans Iowa pretty special: Walter and I are now brothers in this Trans Iowa Family of mine!" (https://www.salsacycles.com/blogs/articles/trans-iowa-v12-the-big-easy)

**Kate Ankofski [UNKNOWN]:** "If I felt like an amateur going into this race, shaking GT's hand left me feeling a little closer to 'making it.'... I've been following these ladies [Brewer Bebe, Allie Corlett, Leah Gruhn] for a while now, and have so much to learn from them. I got to meet Jamie Granquist in person for the first time while she was holding a giant piece of meat; what more could I have hoped for?" (https://transiowa.blogspot.com/p/trans-iowa-stories.html)

**Kate Ankofski [UNKNOWN]:** "I found I enjoyed riding at night, alone. It's so quiet, and there's no time to be afraid... Still, the early miles were a challenge... As I was making my way up one of the rolling hills, I was passed by a cyclist who warned me about the B road ahead, but promised tailwinds for most of the way to the first checkpoint. I was grateful for his words, and for those of everyone who passed — those who called out hello and shared mutual 'Oh, just questioning life choices.' Guitar Ted had advised us to watch out for each other, and everyone I met did so readily." (https://transiowa.blogspot.com/p/trans-iowa-stories.html)

**Kate Ankofski [UNKNOWN]:** "I hesitated to text Guitar Ted; I didn't want him to feel I'd wasted a lottery spot. Despite this disappointment, I'm appreciative of the many firsts for me in this event... And, again, thanks to Guitar Ted for putting on an event that makes you a better, stronger, more resilient person -- whether you officially finish, unofficially finish, or DNF while shivering in a fancy trash bag until your friend rescues you with a heated car and hotel lobby cinnamon rolls." (https://transiowa.blogspot.com/p/trans-iowa-stories.html)

**Guitar Ted [ELITE/Race Director]:** "So, why would anyone want to do something like Trans Iowa? Heck, I don't know the answer to that. As the organizer of this event, I keep expecting to get punched by a rider, but they keep asking me to put it on again the next year. Even the riders that get knocked out of the event want to keep coming back. It is more than a race, it is an event where folks find a common thread, a bond words cannot describe, forged by suffering and dust." (https://dirtscrolls.com/14951591-blast-from-the-past-trans-iowa-and-the-rise-of-gravel-grinders)

**Historical notes [ELITE source]:** Trans Iowa ran from 2005-2018 (14 editions total). Registration was by postcard entry for 12 of 14 years. The Gravel Cycling Hall of Fame inducted "Post Card Entries" as their "Gravel Icon" in 2024 because of Trans Iowa's usage. Guitar Ted was inducted into the Gravel Cycling Hall of Fame in 2022. (https://transiowa.blogspot.com/)

**Josh Patterson, Bike Radar [ELITE source]:** "Stevenson promoted Trans Iowa from 2005 to 2018 and was instrumental in amplifying gravel riding through his blogging and reportage. More than any other individual, he is responsible for gravel cycling as we know it today." (https://transiowa.blogspot.com/)

**Anonymous [UNKNOWN]:** "I love muddy cross races and I was actually a little more excited because it was not going to be a roadie coarse. #Sicko" (Pre-race attitude toward TI v11 wet conditions) (https://www.bikeiowa.com/Blog/1568/trans-iowa-v11-recap)

**TI v14 (2018) final results [Race Director]:** Janna Vavra "has the distinction of being the first woman to finish a Trans Iowa (T.I.v7) and the last one that ever will. She also won the Black Mountain Cycles' Grittiest Ride award for the event." She finished at 12:50pm Sunday. (https://transiowa.blogspot.com/)

**Guitar Ted [ELITE/Race Director]:** On the event ending: "5/5/18: Trans Iowa will not happen again. In case you haven't heard or read the news, there will not be a T.I.v15... With my (Guitar Ted's) not being involved in producing this, there cannot be a v15 and there are no plans to 'hand over' the event at this time, or in the foreseeable future. Thank you for all the years of support and for the memories!" (https://transiowa.blogspot.com/)

**Iowa Wind and Rock [UNKNOWN]:** A successor event started in 2026: "Iowa Wind and Rock is NOT, nor will it ever be TransIowa. However, we want to provide people a similar challenge — A free, 340ish mile, cue sheet navigated, late spring, Iowa event that allows entrants to challenge themselves, expand their boundaries, and allow them to see what they are capable of." Run by "Iowans, TransIowa finishers, and people who enjoy stretching personal boundaries." (https://iowawindandrock.com/)
