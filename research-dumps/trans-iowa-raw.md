## Summary

Trans Iowa was a pioneering ultra-endurance gravel cycling event that ran from 2005 to 2018 (14 editions). Co-founded by Jeff Kerkove and Mark Stevenson (Guitar Ted), it was one of the first and most influential gravel races in the United States. The race featured 320-345 miles of Iowa gravel roads, navigated entirely by cue sheets with no GPS allowed, completely self-supported with no aid stations, and a brutal 34-hour time limit. Notable for its underground ethos (free entry, no prizes), unpredictable weather, challenging B-roads, and low finish rates (often under 25%), Trans Iowa inspired countless other gravel events including what is now Unbound Gravel. The race ended in 2018, but its spirit continues through the successor event Iowa Wind and Rock.
