# TRANS-SYLVANIA EPIC — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Sam Koerber [ELITE]:** "I raced hard in the prologue and got 5th, 4 minutes off Justin Lindine. I thought I was going fast but apparently not enough... I rode a wave of motivation into the first singletrack climb on day two; it was rocky, hard just to stay upright and moving forward... going over the bars I waited too long to eject and couldn't get my hands in front of my face. I knocked my teeth on a rock and broke the front two but no blood." (https://www.blueridgeoutdoors.com/biking/trans-sylvania-epic-race-retrospective/)

**Sam Koerber [ELITE]:** "I went harder for three hours than any effort of any length since wearing a heart monitor, harder than I ever thought I could... The rest of the week, for me, became a close battle for second place, a chance to reflect on a lot of old memories, racing and otherwise, and a time to camp out." (https://www.blueridgeoutdoors.com/biking/trans-sylvania-epic-race-retrospective/)

**Justin Lindine [ELITE]:** "We rode a great team race all week long... We did smart team tactics all week. Payson unfortunately flatted yesterday, and so I had the leader's jersey today... It's so nice to have the cards to play. Peter [Glassford] had an unfortunate situation trying to battle all three of us. You fight those odds and it's impossible to win." (https://www.cxmagazine.com/lindine-barclay-win-notubes-transsylvania-epic)

**Justin Lindine [ELITE]:** "Today was hard. This day is always like a normal cross country race at the end of some endurance days, so your legs don't want to do what you want them to do. Between Peter and Payson charging, it was managing the leaks in the ship." (https://www.cxmagazine.com/lindine-barclay-win-notubes-transsylvania-epic)

**Payson McElveen [ELITE]:** "I threw everything I could at Justin, but I knew seven minutes was a pretty tall task in 28 miles... My plan was to sneak into the singletrack first and hope he'd be a couple riders back, but I went a little too early and he just jumped on my wheel." (https://www.cxmagazine.com/lindine-barclay-win-notubes-transsylvania-epic)

**Payson McElveen [ELITE]:** "It's pretty bittersweet. It'll take some time to fully appreciate, but it's an improvement from last year. It was everything, having a team. Poor Peter. He didn't complain a single time, just pulled. Based on how much he could have complained, I was so impressed with his professionalism." (https://www.cxmagazine.com/lindine-barclay-win-notubes-transsylvania-epic)

**Dan Timmerman [ELITE]:** "I was of no consequence in the GC, so I figured the guys would give me a bit of room... And I attacked at a good place. No backpack today. I think that was it. My back was feeling good today!" (https://www.cxmagazine.com/lindine-barclay-win-notubes-transsylvania-epic)

**Vicki Barclay [ELITE]:** "Today was definitely a parade! There was a bit of confusion for a bit, since two of the Under 25 riders were going to race, so women in the elite category got nervous that if they went fast enough, it would change the overall GC standings... First GC win here! It feels amazing. I was a little concerned in the last day that something would happen to my bike and everyone would just ditch me." (https://www.cxmagazine.com/lindine-barclay-win-notubes-transsylvania-epic)

**Mical Dyck [ELITE]:** "It was a fun week, but abusive on the body and bum! It was super nice today doing a parade lap and not having to go for it... I knew it would be rocky, that's what I had heard about the trails out here. In Victoria, BC, we have a ton of rocks, but different rocks. We have big rock slabs. But this is constant false flats so you have to pedal through smaller rocks all day. I would definitely challenge it again, I like to suffer." (https://www.cxmagazine.com/lindine-barclay-win-notubes-transsylvania-epic)

**Crystal Anthony [ELITE]:** "It was super challenging in a lot of different ways. It was such a great event, I'm so glad I was here. I've only done one other one, with a lot more people, around 1,200 people, so this is much more close-knit and fun." (https://www.cxmagazine.com/lindine-barclay-win-notubes-transsylvania-epic)

**Libby White [COMPETITIVE]:** "It's been exhausting! After day 1, I wasn't sure if I was going to keep it. I was surprised to get the lead on day 1, but I kind of killed myself. Then enduro day came and all these long days, but today we had ourselves a parade stage and finished things out." (https://www.cxmagazine.com/lindine-barclay-win-notubes-transsylvania-epic)

**Libby White [COMPETITIVE]:** "The motivation came from talking to people and making sure I was having fun. When you ride this many hours, you have to make sure you're having fun and are mentally in the game." (https://www.cxmagazine.com/lindine-barclay-win-notubes-transsylvania-epic)

**Anonymous first-timer [ELITE]:** "Five days of hard racing turned into a real singletrack summer camp and I enjoyed every second of it... From that day on, the five of us just rode bikes and cheered on our fellow tryers. We still followed the course and started with the masses (except day five – we went early to cheer on the leaders), put in decent efforts and ended each day with spirits high." (https://dirtscrolls.com/14960294-the-trans-sylvania-epic-experience-tips-from-a-first-time-stage-racer)

**Anonymous first-timer [ELITE]:** "Day 1 at Big Poe started off fast, and I recall looking down at my GPS around the 15-mile mark, noticing that my average speed was over 12 mph and I was still only fighting for 4th place singlespeed. This was an unfortunate indication of a long week ahead. Thankfully, the rest of the straggling singlespeeders were in the same boat, and we called a truce right then and there on the first day." (https://dirtscrolls.com/14960294-the-trans-sylvania-epic-experience-tips-from-a-first-time-stage-racer)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Tire Selection [ELITE]:**
- Sam Koerber: "my tires correct" - no specific model mentioned but emphasized importance of tire choice (https://www.blueridgeoutdoors.com/biking/trans-sylvania-epic-race-retrospective/)
- Anonymous first-timer [ELITE]: Started with "Maxxis Minion DHR II 29×2.3, Tubeless Ready with EXO Casing up front and a Maxxis Minion SS 29×2.3, Tubeless Ready, with EXO casing out back" but later noted: "Next time, I will probably run something more similar to a Maxxis Ardent 2.4 or Ardent Race 2.35 up front and an Ardent Race 2.35 or 2.2 out back. With the amount of gravel in between trail, it would have been nice to cut down some of that rolling resistance." (https://www.singletracks.com/mtb-tips/prepping-for-the-trans-sylvania-epic/)

**Bike Setup [ELITE]:**
- Anonymous first-timer: "I rode a 2017 Pivot LES hardtail, setup as a singlespeed with a 120mm Fox 34 and CrankBrothers dropper post... I decided on 32×19, which I later learned was considered the 'magic gear' for TSE and the one that the majority of us singlespeeders used for the race." (https://www.singletracks.com/mtb-tips/prepping-for-the-trans-sylvania-epic/)
- Sam Koerber [ELITE]: "my bike was ultralight" - weight reduction emphasized (https://www.blueridgeoutdoors.com/biking/trans-sylvania-epic-race-retrospective/)

**Pre-Race Bike Prep [ELITE]:**
Anonymous first-timer: "Before leaving, I disassembled my entire bike, cleaned it, applied grease as needed and re-assembled, ensuring all bolts were torqued to spec and everything received a reasonable once-over. I installed a fresh pair of ESI Extra Chunky grips, a new 10-speed KMC chain and new bottom bracket bearings... if you are not comfortable tearing your bike down and assembling then I would suggest dropping your bike off at the local shop at least 2 weeks prior to the event." (https://www.singletracks.com/mtb-tips/prepping-for-the-trans-sylvania-epic/)

**Mechanical Issues [ELITE]:**
- Anonymous first-timer: "I did end up with a small slice in my rear that was fixed by two Dyna Plugs" (https://www.singletracks.com/mtb-tips/prepping-for-the-trans-sylvania-epic/)
- Payson McElveen [ELITE]: Lost GC lead due to flat: "Payson unfortunately flatted yesterday" (https://www.cxmagazine.com/lindine-barclay-win-notubes-transsylvania-epic)

**Wheels [ELITE]:**
Anonymous first-timer: Used "American Classic's Wide Lightning wheels" stating "They're wider, stiffer, and lighter than the Stan's wheels" - also mentioned "new Bontrager Line Pro 30 TLR wheelset with 108 points of engagement" (https://www.singletracks.com/mtb-tips/prepping-for-the-trans-sylvania-epic/)

**Drivetrain Philosophy [ELITE - Singlespeed specific]:**
Anonymous first-timer: "The Niner was spec'd with a 2×10 crankset, but I prefer 1×10 setups. So, I removed the stock chainrings, front derailleur, and shifter. I installed a 32T Hope Retainer Ring... it's a simpler setup which means there's less that could go wrong. Also, I know I'll be inclined to use the smallest gear I have. That granny ring would sing its siren song, and I would heed its call. Less gears, less excuses–and hopefully faster times." (https://www.singletracks.com/mtb-tips/prepping-for-the-trans-sylvania-epic/)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Rock Character:**
- Sam Koerber [ELITE]: "it was rocky, hard just to stay upright and moving forward. I know better than to look back but I never had the chance anyhow. The rocks were riveting, there are no lines, only the line you invent with the your body English; it's hard stuff. The constant threat of sabotage left its mark early on my face." (https://www.blueridgeoutdoors.com/biking/trans-sylvania-epic-race-retrospective/)
- Sam Koerber [ELITE]: "Uniformly rocky, ferny, and wooded, the terrain is green, and rugged; the trails are well built but un-groomed." (https://www.blueridgeoutdoors.com/biking/trans-sylvania-epic-race-retrospective/)
- Mical Dyck [ELITE]: "In Victoria, BC, we have a ton of rocks, but different rocks. We have big rock slabs. But this is constant false flats so you have to pedal through smaller rocks all day." (https://www.cxmagazine.com/lindine-barclay-win-notubes-transsylvania-epic)
- Anonymous first-timer [ELITE]: "the term 'rock garden' doesn't seem to be used because the entire trail system itself is a rock garden" (https://www.singletracks.com/mtb-tips/prepping-for-the-trans-sylvania-epic/)

**Course Mix:**
- Anonymous first-timer [ELITE]: "With the amount of gravel in between trail" - indicating significant gravel road sections connecting singletrack (https://www.singletracks.com/mtb-tips/prepping-for-the-trans-sylvania-epic/)
- Anonymous first-timer [ELITE]: "I recall looking down at my GPS around the 15-mile mark, noticing that my average speed was over 12 mph" on Day 1 at Big Poe (https://dirtscrolls.com/14960294-the-trans-sylvania-epic-experience-tips-from-a-first-time-stage-racer)

**Stage Lengths [ELITE perspective]:**

- Location consistently identified as "central Pennsylvania's Rothrock and Bald Eagle State Forests" (https://www.singletracks.com/mtb-tips/prepping-for-the-trans-sylvania-epic/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Pace Intensity [ELITE]:**
- Sam Koerber [ELITE]: "The courses are generally shy of three hours for the leaders and as a result the pace is relentless... I went harder for three hours than any effort of any length since wearing a heart monitor, harder than I ever thought I could" (https://www.blueridgeoutdoors.com/biking/trans-sylvania-epic-race-retrospective/)
- Payson McElveen [ELITE]: "I threw everything I could at Justin... My plan was to sneak into the singletrack first and hope he'd be a couple riders back...

**Team Tactics [ELITE]:**
- Justin Lindine [ELITE]: "We rode a great team race all week long... We did smart team tactics all week... We had enough of a gap to have a friendly battle today. It came out perfect, we got 1-2-3 in the general classification." His Competitive Cyclist team coordinated to dominate the podium. (https://www.cxmagazine.com/lindine-barclay-win-notubes-transsylvania-epic)

**Alternative Approach - The "Truce" Strategy [ELITE - Singlespeed]:**
Anonymous first-timer: "Day 1 at Big Poe started off fast... I was still only fighting for 4th place singlespeed. This was an unfortunate indication of a long week ahead. Thankfully, the rest of the straggling singlespeeders were in the same boat, and we called a truce right then and there on the first day... Five days of hard racing turned into a real singletrack summer camp and I enjoyed every second of it."

**Final Day Dynamics [ELITE]:**
- Justin Lindine [ELITE]: "This day is always like a normal cross country race at the end of some endurance days, so your legs don't want to do what you want them to do." (https://www.cxmagazine.com/lindine-barclay-win-notubes-transsylvania-epic)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Crashes [ELITE]:**
Sam Koerber [ELITE]: "I went for a big move up on rock to the right to avoid a pile of little sharp rocks, going over the bars I waited too long to eject and couldn't get my hands in front of my face. I knocked my teeth on a rock and broke the front two but no blood. Scrambling back on and pushing even harder I kept about a minute lead" - continued racing despite broken teeth (https://www.blueridgeoutdoors.com/biking/trans-sylvania-epic-race-retrospective/)

**Risk Mitigation Philosophy [ELITE]:**
Anonymous first-timer: "To finish first, you must first finish. -Rick Mears... This is a quote I often think of when getting ready to race. It reminds me to make sure my equipment is dialed before I toe the line... it's also a reminder to ride smart. Sometimes it's better to take the safe line over some rocks than to launch into the unknown. You may save your wheel from getting destroyed or stop from shearing off your derailleur–a surefire way to end your day, or in this case, your week." (https://www.singletracks.com/mtb-tips/prepping-for-the-trans-sylvania-epic/)

## Logistics & Accommodations

**Lodging Options:**
Anonymous first-timer [ELITE]: "TSE offers both RV/tent camping as well as indoor lodging right next to the start/finish area for most of the stages." Detailed pros/cons:
- Lodge pros: "Safe haven from rain, Full use of kitchen including dishes, running water, and a fridge, Electric for lights and charging devices, Easier to be social and make new friends"
- Lodge cons: "You have a bunkmate which could be a stranger on day 1, Your bedtime is dictated by the group light sleepers beware, Convenience has an additional cost, Can get extremely hot and humid inside depending on weather"
- Camping pros: "You can escape the social scene as needed, Bedtime is on your terms, Included in entry fee"
- Camping cons: "Shower flip-flops highly suggested in communal bath house, More things to pack, A short but inconvenient walk to water, Fewer places to escape from the rain, No power hook ups" (https://www.singletracks.com/mtb-tips/prepping-for-the-trans-sylvania-epic/)

**Travel:**
Anonymous first-timer [ELITE]: "I decided to drive to Pennsylvania from Atlanta instead of flying. It's going to be a long haul at 12+ hours, but it will be less expensive and less stressful in the long run. I won't have to worry about the airline damaging my bike or getting gouged on baggage fees... Driving to the race also means I can bring a lot more stuff with me… like an entire bike as backup to scavenge parts off of if needed, my work stand, and complete tool kit." (https://www.singletracks.com/mtb-tips/prepping-for-the-trans-sylvania-epic/)

**Food Options:**
- Anonymous first-timer [ELITE]: "The Trans-Sylvania Epic offers meal plans for the week, which gets you breakfast and dinner each day. They even offer vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free options for those with with specific dietary restrictions. In my experience, meal plans are the way to go. It's one less thing for you to worry about each day. There's even a laundry option where you drop off your dirty kit in the evening and it comes back clean the next morning!" (https://www.singletracks.com/mtb-tips/prepping-for-the-trans-sylvania-epic/)
- Anonymous first-timer [ELITE]: "There is an ice machine available at TSE from the main office, which is something I did not know until the last day" (https://dirtscrolls.com/14960294-the-trans-sylvania-epic-experience-tips-from-a-first-time-stage-racer)

**Food Strategy for Self-Catering [ELITE]:**
Anonymous first-timer: "I am a firm believer in not changing your diet or trying to prepare complicated meals. I prefer to just keep it simple... when camping, I found it to be very convenient to have pre-made food that you can eat cold or requires little prep and cook time." Brought: "Breakfast: coffee, granola cereal, eggs, oatmeal, almond butter, bananas; Lunch/Dinner: taco meat and spinach wraps, avocados, tuna, pizza; Snacks and riding fuel: Pop-Tarts, date bars, Trader Joe's Penguins, pretzels, hummus" (https://dirtscrolls.com/14960294-the-trans-sylvania-epic-experience-tips-from-a-first-time-stage-racer)

**Cooler Recommendation [ELITE]:**
Anonymous first-timer: "The crazy thing about the Orca cooler is that I never refilled it with ice, and I drove home with enough ice in the cooler after six days that I did not have to be concerned with unpacking it right away. The Orca's price made it hard to pull the trigger on the purchase, but it is totally worth the investment" (https://dirtscrolls.com/14960294-the-trans-sylvania-epic-experience-tips-from-a-first-time-stage-racer)

**Base Camp:**

- Anonymous first-timer [ELITE]: "I personally feel that better friendships were formed through our five days of shenanigans than if we were all heads down, fighting for the podium. You have to take a step back and remember why you continue this hobby and for 90% of us, there is no real chance to make a living racing bikes."

- Anonymous first-timer [ELITE]: "From that day on, the five of us just rode bikes and cheered on our fellow tryers... we went early to cheer on the leaders" on day 5 (https://dirtscrolls.com/14960294-the-trans-sylvania-epic-experience-tips-from-a-first-time-stage-racer)

**Event Production:**
- Sam Koerber [ELITE]: "The race has a fun, and professional character that can be both relaxed and serious as the mood demands. The racing is top notch and the courses are challenging but makable by the majority of the peloton. The evening slide show and the daily films are a lot of fun, seeing the pictures solidifies a memory and gives you a chance to relive the day in a different light." (https://www.blueridgeoutdoors.com/biking/trans-sylvania-epic-race-retrospective/)

**Volunteer Support:**
Anonymous first-timer [ELITE]: "Volunteers are essential to the event's success, and the organizers offer several perks for those who help out.
