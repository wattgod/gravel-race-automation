# TRANSCONTINENTAL RACE — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Vincent Nadon [RECREATIONAL]:** "Instead of aiming for a specific ranking, I decided to focus on experiencing the journey. Otherwise, I would have been anxious the whole time, unable to appreciate what I was doing... I told myself I just wanted to visit Europe by bike and reach the finish line in one piece. I had a lot to learn from this experience, which could be useful in other situations in my life." (https://www.panoramacycles.com/blogs/blog/tcr-2023-race-report)

**Vincent Nadon [RECREATIONAL]:** "After pushing harder in the Swiss mountains to improve my position in the race, I completely missed the first checkpoint! I was only 2 km away, fortunately, but issue after issue (dead phone, GPS coordinates pointing to the wrong place…) I ended up losing an hour trying to find the Checkpoint 1 hotel!" (https://www.panoramacycles.com/blogs/blog/tcr-2023-race-report)

**Vincent Nadon [RECREATIONAL]:** "My highlights: The highest point was when I took the gravel road between 4a and 4b and looked back at everything I had climbed. The lowest point was on parcours 3, which seemed endless with the heat and the tough gravel for kilometers." (https://www.panoramacycles.com/blogs/blog/tcr-2023-race-report)

**Christoph Strasser [ELITE]:** "Last year seems like a warm-up ride for this year... I'm definitely feeling well prepared, but of course, there is a little bit of nervousness because there are so many things that can happen and there are new countries we have to ride through, so it will be very exciting." (https://www.lostdot.cc/blog/the-transcontinental-race-no10-pre-race-report)

**Christoph Strasser [ELITE]:** "I'm a little bit afraid of the number four Parcours in Türkiye, the off-road section, because I'm always a little bit afraid of the off-road section. It will be a big challenge, there is just no information at all and if you check the Strava heat map, you see that nobody has ever ridden there before." (https://www.lostdot.cc/blog/the-transcontinental-race-no10-pre-race-report)

**Robin Gemperle [ELITE]:** "It's my third really big race and last year was the very first attempt in actually going for a win in a major race. I think it just makes sense that now with the third attempt, chances are way higher than they have been last year." (https://www.lostdot.cc/blog/the-transcontinental-race-no10-pre-race-report)

**Tim de Witte [ELITE]:** "I think there might be a few contenders for the first place, so I think it will be a big battle in the beginning. I think I have spent more time than the two previous years combined on making my route, maybe it's because I feel the pressure not to screw this up." (https://www.lostdot.cc/blog/the-transcontinental-race-no10-pre-race-report)

**Josh Ibbett [ELITE]:** "I always had it in my head that I'd like to do it again at some point. I thought either 10 years since I won it, which would be next year, or 10 years since I first did it... I haven't got any expectations. I've been able to win the thing, not against some of the guys who are there [now], but I know how to win it because I've done it so I know it is possible, but they're a different calibre of rider." (https://www.lostdot.cc/blog/the-transcontinental-race-no10-pre-race-report)

**Jaimi Wilson [ELITE]:** "To be honest, I don't feel super prepared, but I never do. I'm the least organised person. I think the more of these I do, the more relaxed I seem to get. It's probably not a good thing. I mean anything can happen that can stop you from doing it because there's so many external things, but I guess I know that I'm always capable of doing it." (https://www.lostdot.cc/blog/the-transcontinental-race-no10-pre-race-report)

**Alex Kopp [ELITE]:** "I feel quite comfortable to be in unsupported bike race mode because of doing the Atlas Mountain Race in February, then in May The Accursed, but this race is completely different. I have never planned such a long route on tarmac and I'm doing it for the first time, whereas Robin and Christoph have done it for the last two or three years, so they know what they are doing." (https://www.lostdot.cc/blog/the-transcontinental-race-no10-pre-race-report)

**Cynthia Carson [ELITE]:** "I haven't spent a lot of time in the East of Europe, so I'm really looking forward to it. I hear the hospitality is amazing and the more East you go it gets more gnarly. I have no idea what to expect but I'm ready to explore and see everything when I'm racing." (https://www.lostdot.cc/blog/the-transcontinental-race-no10-pre-race-report)

**Cynthia Carson [ELITE]:** "If she [Fiona Kolbinger] can do it, so can I. That's how I live my life. If somebody else is out there doing it, I can do it too." (https://www.lostdot.cc/blog/the-transcontinental-race-no10-pre-race-report)

**Sebastian Breuer [UNKNOWN]:** "The TCR is not just a race—it's a journey that changes you. The mental challenge is just as tough as the physical one." (https://cyclite.cc/en/blogs/news/10-long-distance-cycling-events-to-follow-in-2025)

**Marei Moldenhauer [COMPETITIVE]:** "Despite the disappointment, the most important part is that I really did have an amazing two weeks or so, including riding to the start of the race, hurtling my way through 11 very distinct countries" (https://www.cyclingnews.com/features/transcontinental-racing-4000km-from-belgium-to-greece-in-less-than-nine-days/)

**Christoph Strasser [ELITE] on TCR9 victory:** "In the race, it was the excitement to go to my limit, the excitement of the battle and challenge with Robin. I think we have been motivating each other - when you see the other is going deep, you want to do your best, and the other way around... I can imagine I will be back. Maybe we will see other strong riders beyond me and Robin. After two successful races, there is no reason for me to stop and if strong people are here, I am very motivated to return." (https://www.cyclingnews.com/features/transcontinental-racing-4000km-from-belgium-to-greece-in-less-than-nine-days/)

**Josh Ibbett [ELITE] at TCR6 start:** "Mainly a split between 4Season Disc and 4Season Gravel Disc with a few carbons and dynamos thrown in." (https://eu.huntbikewheels.com/blogs/news/readers-rides-transcontinental-race-no-6-setups)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

### Bikes & Frame Setup

**Vincent Nadon [RECREATIONAL]:** Used the Panorama Cycles Katahdin with 32mm road tires for most of TCR 2023. "The Katahdin from Panorama Cycles was honestly a very good bike for the TCR. Even with the luggage on the bike for crossing Europe, its handling on descents was really top-notch! Although I did most of the race on 32mm road tires, the Katahdin also allowed me to use gravel tires for the rougher sections." (https://www.panoramacycles.com/blogs/blog/tcr-2023-race-report)

**Vincent Nadon [RECREATIONAL]:** Ran a double chainring and large cassette (11-42T) "to have a wide range of gears for climbing while still having the right gearing for long flat sections (I should mention that the flat sections weren't that long in this edition of the TCR 😅)" (https://www.panoramacycles.com/blogs/blog/tcr-2023-race-report)

**Cynthia Carson [ELITE] TCR11:** Custom 3T Strada Italia Project X with 1x mullet setup: 42T chainring with 10-52 cassette, SRAM Red/Force drivetrain, Schwalbe Pro One 34mm tires, Tailfin R&D bags. "With the distance, the elevation and the loaded Tailfin setup, it makes perfect sense... The Strada Italia was designed to be its most aerodynamic with 30-35mm AM road tires. It's a combination of aerodynamics and comfort that few other bikes can match." (https://3t.bike/blogs/news/transcontinental-race-no11-a-pilgrimage-to-the-black-sea)

**TCR6 Field [ELITE]:** "Mainly a split between 4Season Disc and 4Season Gravel Disc with a few carbons and dynamos thrown in" - Josh Ibbett observation. "There was a general shift for riders to be on more sturdy wheels this year. This is presumably because of the few gravel sections thrown in as well as the infamous off-road section from a few years ago which many rider's TCR was brought to an abrupt end." (https://eu.huntbikewheels.com/blogs/news/readers-rides-transcontinental-race-no-6-setups)

### Luggage & Packing

**Vincent Nadon [RECREATIONAL]:** "For luggage, I fully trusted Apidura with their Expedition and Race series. 14L + 2L + 4L" (https://www.panoramacycles.com/blogs/blog/tcr-2023-race-report)

**TCR6 Field [ELITE]:** "Outside of the bikes and wheels, we were surprised to see just how slimmed down rider's luggage set-ups are getting - a sure sign of how serious this epic event is becoming." Multiple riders spotted with only frame bags to fit two bottles. Custom carbon frame bags and aero placement observed. (https://eu.huntbikewheels.com/blogs/news/readers-rides-transcontinental-race-no-6-setups)

### Essential Accessories

**Vincent Nadon [RECREATIONAL]:** "Clip-on aero bars are, of course, a must to have more position options and maintain comfort over long distances, in addition to being more aerodynamic and thus gaining a bit of speed and/or saving more energy depending on how you see the situation 😉" (https://www.panoramacycles.com/blogs/blog/tcr-2023-race-report)

**Vincent Nadon [RECREATIONAL]:** "I had a few equipment adjustments, such as a tool bag that fell off and a 3D-printed mount for my Garmin Varia that gave way under the vibrations of the Flemish cobblestones." (https://www.panoramacycles.com/blogs/blog/tcr-2023-race-report)

### Sleep System

**Vincent Nadon [RECREATIONAL]:** "For sleeping, for example, I opted for a lightweight and compact down jacket to replace a sleeping bag, reducing both weight and volume. The jacket could also be used for really cold days on the bike." Equipment philosophy: "durability, comfort, and versatility." (https://www.panoramacycles.com/blogs/blog/tcr-2023-race-report)

## Weather Experienced

**Vincent Nadon [RECREATIONAL] - TCR 2023:** Experienced significant heat: "The lowest point was on parcours 3, which seemed endless with the heat and the tough gravel for kilometers." (https://www.panoramacycles.com/blogs/blog/tcr-2023-race-report)

**TCR 2023 Field:** "We've experienced the effects of climate-related extreme weather events first-hand in our Racing grounds, with severe flooding in Slovenia putting riders at risk while raging heatwaves in the south of Europe exacerbated riders' suffering on an already arduous route" - Hannah Larbalestier, TCR9 Race Coordinator (https://www.cyclingnews.com/features/transcontinental-racing-4000km-from-belgium-to-greece-in-less-than-nine-days/)

**TCR 2023 Alpine sections:** "The icy conditions came early in the journey, with the first control point taking riders to the heights of the Italian Alps and over some of the highest paved roads in the region to reach the Passo dello Spluga" (https://www.cyclingnews.com/features/transcontinental-racing-4000km-from-belgium-to-greece-in-less-than-nine-days/)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

### Cobbled Sections

**Vincent Nadon [RECREATIONAL] - TCR 2023:** "A 3D-printed mount for my Garmin Varia that gave way under the vibrations of the Flemish cobblestones" (https://www.panoramacycles.com/blogs/blog/tcr-2023-race-report)

**TCR10 Route:** "Heading out of Roubaix, riders strike out for Geraardsbergen, the spiritual home of the TCR, via a Parcours composed of well-known cobbled climbs." Start includes "a lap of the iconic Roubaix velodrome" (https://www.lostdot.cc/blog/the-transcontinental-race-no10-pre-race-report)

### Gravel & Off-Road

**Vincent Nadon [RECREATIONAL] - TCR 2023:** "After some route planning issues, which caused me to lose precious time on some tricky gravel roads within the first 500km" (https://www.panoramacycles.com/blogs/blog/tcr-2023-race-report)

**TCR10 CP2:** "Bjelašnica awaits... riders will take a different track skirting below the summit – representing the first off-road section of the Race." Historical note: "During the Bosnian War (1992-95), Bjelašnica was a key battleground" (https://www.lostdot.cc/blog/the-transcontinental-race-no10-pre-race-report)

**TCR 2023 Carinthian region:** "This took riders to the Carinthian region, a place of rugged peaks and dense forests where the paved roads give way to rougher surfaces, sometimes gravel and sometimes rough-hewn rock." (https://www.cyclingnews.com/features/transcontinental-racing-4000km-from-belgium-to-greece-in-less-than-nine-days/)

### Mountain Passes

**TCR10 CP1:** "Mangartsko Sedlo, a road with 17% gradients and a summit over 2000m high, offering riders uninterrupted views of the stunning Julian Alps" (https://www.lostdot.cc/blog/the-transcontinental-race-no10-pre-race-report)

**TCR 2023:** "First control point taking riders to the heights of the Italian Alps and over some of the highest paved roads in the region to reach the Passo dello Spluga and registration in Livigno" (https://www.cyclingnews.com/features/transcontinental-racing-4000km-from-belgium-to-greece-in-less-than-nine-days/)

**TCR12 CP1:** "Rallarvegen" climb out of Flåm - "riders will soon find their yardstick as they measure their climb out on the Rallarvegen in hours, not minutes." (https://www.lostdot.cc/tcr)

**TCR12 CP2:** Slovakia - "the twin parcours first takes riders over the Czech giant Praded, and then to the foot of the mighty Chopok mountain in Slovakia - so high it is better known for its skiing than its cycling." (https://www.lostdot.cc/tcr)

**TCR12 CP4:** Albania - "In the shadow of Mt Korab on the North Macedonian border, our parcours once more rollercoasters back through time in one of Albania's remotest corners - a land with no shortcuts. Donkeys and oxen outnumber modern machinery, and where other roads might bridge a chasm, here you must descend to the valley floor before winding slowly up the other side." (https://www.lostdot.cc/tcr)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

### Elite-Level Performance

**Christoph Strasser [ELITE] - TCR9 Winner:** Completed 8 days, 16 hours, 30 minutes. Noted that 2023 felt far harder than 2022: "Last year seems like a warm-up ride for this year." Finished more than six hours ahead of second place Robin Gemperle despite close racing through checkpoints. (https://www.cyclingnews.com/features/transcontinental-racing-4000km-from-belgium-to-greece-in-less-than-nine-days/)

**Robin Gemperle [ELITE] - TCR9 Second Place:** Was ahead at CP1, trailed by only 19 minutes at CP2 (Zgornje Jezersko), demonstrating the neck-and-neck nature of elite racing. "When you see the other is going deep, you want to do your best, and the other way around." (https://www.cyclingnews.com/features/transcontinental-racing-4000km-from-belgium-to-greece-in-less-than-nine-days/)

**Tim de Witte [ELITE] - TCR9 Third Place & Green Leaderboard Winner:** Finished in 9 days, 10 hours, 12 minutes while using only buses and trains for travel to/from the race. (https://www.cyclingnews.com/features/transcontinental-racing-4000km-from-belgium-to-greece-in-less-than-nine-days/)

**Jaimi Wilson [ELITE] - TCR9 Fastest Woman:** Finished 25th overall GC in 11 days, 7 hours, 39 minutes. Demonstrates top women can place well in overall standings. (https://www.cyclingnews.com/features/transcontinental-racing-4000km-from-belgium-to-greece-in-less-than-nine-days/)

### Recreational-Level Strategy

**Vincent Nadon [RECREATIONAL] - TCR 2023:** Initially had multiple goals including finishing within 11-14 days and targeting top 20, but shifted strategy mid-race: "After pushing harder in the Swiss mountains to improve my position in the race, I completely missed the first checkpoint!... Frustrated with my situation, I finally changed my mindset and tried to enjoy the journey as much as possible, while staying within my time limits as much as I could. Instead of aiming for a specific ranking, I decided to focus on experiencing the journey. Otherwise, I would have been anxious the whole time, unable to appreciate what I was doing." This mental shift may have actually improved performance. (https://www.panoramacycles.com/blogs/blog/tcr-2023-race-report)

### Route Planning

**Tim de Witte [ELITE]:** "I think I have spent more time than the two previous years combined on making my route, maybe it's because I feel the pressure not to screw this up. I want to do as well as I did last year, I want to be at the same level again." Indicates route planning intensity increases with experience and ambition. (https://www.lostdot.cc/blog/the-transcontinental-race-no10-pre-race-report)

**Vincent Nadon [RECREATIONAL]:** "After some route planning issues, which caused me to lose precious time on some tricky gravel roads within the first 500km" - demonstrates importance of thorough route research even for non-competitive riders. (https://www.panoramacycles.com/blogs/blog/tcr-2023-race-report)

### Mental Game

**Josh Ibbett [ELITE]:** "I'm going to use every single piece of experience and knowledge to do what I can" - highlighting the value of experience over pure physical preparation when facing today's stronger field. (https://www.lostdot.cc/blog/the-transcontinental-race-no10-pre-race-report)

**Vincent Nadon [RECREATIONAL]:** "Mistakes are human, and they are part of the race. I told myself I just wanted to visit Europe by bike and reach the finish line in one piece. I had a lot to learn from this experience, which could be useful in other situations in my life. This probably helped my mental state a lot, and I believe it might have even improved my performance." (https://www.panoramacycles.com/blogs/blog/tcr-2023-race-report)

## DNF Risk Factors

### Equipment Failures

**Vincent Nadon [RECREATIONAL] - TCR 2023:** "I also had to make a few equipment adjustments, such as a tool bag that fell off and a 3D-printed mount for my Garmin Varia that gave way under the vibrations of the Flemish cobblestones. These issues made me lose time, even though I thought my setup was robust." (https://www.panoramacycles.com/blogs/blog/tcr-2023-race-report)

**Cynthia Carson [ELITE] - TCR11:** Experienced "her 5th or 6th flat tire of the race" including a "bus station flat clinic" - multiple flats are a common issue even for elite riders. (https://3t.bike/blogs/news/transcontinental-race-no11-a-pilgrimage-to-the-black-sea)

**Historical TCR6 context:** "There was a general shift for riders to be on more sturdy wheels this year. This is presumably because of the few gravel sections thrown in as well as the infamous off-road section from a few years ago which many rider's TCR was brought to an abrupt end." (https://eu.huntbikewheels.com/blogs/news/readers-rides-transcontinental-race-no-6-setups)

### Navigation & Checkpoint Errors

**Vincent Nadon [RECREATIONAL] - TCR 2023:** "After pushing harder in the Swiss mountains to improve my position in the race, I completely missed the first checkpoint! I was only 2 km away, fortunately, but issue after issue (dead phone, GPS coordinates pointing to the wrong place…) I ended up losing an hour trying to find the Checkpoint 1 hotel! I probably lost all the gains from my previous efforts." (https://www.panoramacycles.com/blogs/blog/tcr-2023-race-report)

### Health Challenges

**Vincent Nadon [RECREATIONAL] - with Crohn's Disease:** "I had a relatively low iron level, which is a symptom that can occur with Crohn's. A low iron level can lead to more fatigue with effort and can become dangerous (anemia)." Required prescription Feramax supplement. "The worst was after the race when I had a hemorrhoid flare-up. Probably a reaction to the reduction in effort, possible dehydration in the last days, and the beginning of relaxation from the stress/adrenaline of the race. It's not glamorous and very uncomfortable. Fortunately, it only happened after the race, and I already had the cream with me during the trip." (https://www.panoramacycles.com/blogs/blog/tcr-2023-race-report)

### Difficult Terrain Sections

**Vincent Nadon [RECREATIONAL]:** "The most difficult part was finding electrolytes once I reached the Balkans. I discovered a bit after the race that electrolytes are sometimes only sold in pharmacies." Resource availability becomes critical in eastern Europe sections. (https://www.panoramacycles.com/blogs/blog/tcr-2023-race-report)

**Christoph Strasser [ELITE]:** "I'm a little bit afraid of the number four Parcours in Türkiye, the off-road section, because I'm always a little bit afraid of the off-road section. It will be a big challenge, there is just no information at all and if you check the Strava heat map, you see that nobody has ever ridden there before." Even elite road specialists express concern about unexplored off-road parcours. (https://www.lostdot.cc/blog/the-transcontinental-race-no10-pre-race-report)

### Climate Extremes

**TCR9 conditions:** "Severe flooding in Slovenia putting riders at risk while raging heatwaves in the south of Europe exacerbated riders' suffering on an already arduous route" (https://www.cyclingnews.com/features/transcontinental-racing-4000km-from-belgium-to-greece-in-less-than-nine-days/)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

### Race Evolution & Growth

**TCR6 to present:** "Outside of the bikes and wheels, we were surprised to see just how slimmed down rider's luggage set-ups are getting - a sure sign of how serious this epic event is becoming." Josh Ibbett's observation on professionalization of the field. (https://eu.huntbikewheels.com/blogs/news/readers-rides-transcontinental-race-no-6-setups)

**Reddit community perspective [ELITE]:** "The TCR has been going on for ten years. It is still a niche event but it is getting bigger and attracting more media attention... The transcontinental race has been going for a few days now. This is the premier ultra-cycling event on the calendar." (https://www.reddit.com/r/ultracycling/comments/1583l8c/transcontinental_race/)

### Women's Participation

**TCR10 (2024):** "The 40 women on the start line making it the largest women's field at a TCR ever" (https://www.lostdot.cc/blog/the-transcontinental-race-no10-pre-race-report)

**TCR11 (2025):** "Lost Dot's 100Women campaign has attracted a record 79 to the startline" (https://dotwatcher.cc/race/transcontinental-race-no11-2025)

**Women's competitive success:** Fiona Kolbinger won overall in TCR7 (2020) with a time of 10 days, 8 hours, 18 minutes. In TCR9, Jaimi Wilson finished 25th overall, demonstrating women regularly compete in overall standings rather than separate categories. (https://www.cyclingnews.com/features/transcontinental-racing-4000km-from-belgium-to-greece-in-less-than-nine-days/)

### Sustainability Initiatives

**Green Leaderboard - introduced TCR9:** "Designed to incentivise and reward riders opting for sustainable travel approaches, avoiding flights and travelling overland to and from the race as part of the effort to reduce the overall carbon footprint." About a quarter of the TCR9 field participated. Won by Tim de Witte who "headed home from Thessaloniki on buses and trains." (https://www.cyclingnews.com/features/transcontinental-racing-4000km-from-belgium-to-greece-in-less-than-nine-days/)

### Personal Connections to Route

**Sherry Cardona & Gereon Tewes [ELITE pairs winners 2023]:** "Istanbul was the first trip we did as a couple. Shortly after we met we went for a weekend trip to Istanbul, and that was one of the reasons why we said let's go back and do it again. Last year's experience made us stronger together and hopefully this year we survive again." (https://www.lostdot.cc/blog/the-transcontinental-race-no10-pre-race-report)

**Jaimi Wilson [ELITE]:** "When I cycled around the world a few years ago, I went through Istanbul and stayed there for a few weeks and I absolutely loved it so I've always wanted to go back" (https://www.lostdot.cc/blog/the-transcontinental-race-no10-pre-race-report)

### Field Diversity

**TCR9 field composition:** "Around 350 riders this year also faced mandatory gravel sections along the journey from the start on the unrelenting cobbled ascent of the Muur-Kepelmuur in Geraardsbergen on July 23 to Thessaloniki... with riders facing a shorter but more mountainous route in 2023." Mix of elite racers targeting podiums and recreational riders targeting completion over 11-15 days. (https://www.cyclingnews.com/features/transcontinental-racing-4000km-from-belgium-to-greece-in-less-than-nine-days/)

### Finish Line Experience

**TCR12 finish description:** "Whilst the fastest charioteers could make a fortune, the fastest finishers of the Transcontinental will find no more and no less than those behind them: a warm embrace and a cold beer." (https://www.lostdot.cc/tcr)

**Post-race reflection - Vincent Nadon [RECREATIONAL]:** "I think it's a great lesson of humility and a beautiful adventure across Europe. I had high aspirations before arriving in Belgium. Once the race started, I encountered so many unforeseen problems that I realized that despite my experience in ultra-endurance races and my performances in Quebec, the TCR is a race where the cyclist's experience in very long and unsupported races makes all the difference." (https://www.panoramacycles.com/blogs/blog/tcr-2023-race-report)
