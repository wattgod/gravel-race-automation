# FORUM INSIGHTS & COMMUNITY WISDOM

## Sleep Strategy Insights

### Elite Approach
- James Mark Hayden (2x winner): ~3 hours per night average
- Christoph Strasser (6x RAAM winner): 6-9 hours TOTAL over 8 days
- Quote: "This amount of sleep was on the absolute limit of what I could sustain while operating at a good level"

### Recommended for First-Timers
- 4-6 hours per night plus occasional naps
- Body adapts to ~2 hours less than normal for 2 weeks
- Quote: "When new to the sport, err on the side of too much sleep"
- Power naps: Even 15 minutes makes huge difference

### Sleep Banking
- Extend sleep 1 hour/night for week before race
- Stay in bed 10+ hours for 3 nights before event
- Proven to improve cognitive function during deprivation

### Cautionary Tale
> "In the first Transcontinental race I did in 2015, I was an idiot and thought sleeping in twenty minute windows like Christof Strasser would be a good idea. It all fell apart horribly."
> - James Hayden (ended up cycling around Ljubljana for an hour in sleep-drunk daze)

## Equipment Recommendations

### Bike Type
- Road bikes still dominant but gravel gaining popularity
- Trend toward wider tires (40-44mm now more common than sub-30mm)
- Gravel frames "quite forgiving" for comfort
- Quote: "32mm road tires were not enough for rough sections"

### Drivetrain
- Shimano Di2 popular (electronic shifting)
- Some prefer mechanical (easier field repair, one less thing to charge)
- Gearing: 50/34 or 46/33 front, 11-32 or 11-36 rear
- Quote: "Snapped gear cables and sore fingers from shifting on mechanical"

### Bags (Typical Setup)
- Saddle pack: 7-9L (Apidura Racing)
- Aerobar pack: 2-2.5L
- Frame bag: 4L
- Top tube bag: 2L

### Lighting
- Son dynamo hubs very popular
- Edelux II front light
- Battery-powered alternatives: Lupine lights
- Critical for night riding (often 70+ hours in single stint for leaders)

### Navigation
- Garmin 1030 primary + backup unit (Wahoo Elemnt Bolt)
- Route loaded on multiple devices
- Backup routes on phone (Komoot, RideWithGPS)

### Sleeping Gear
- Borah Gear bivy or Alpkit Hunka
- Superlight sleeping mat (Klymit Inertia)
- Sea to Summit down quilt
- Quote: "A tent is nice but pitching/packing costs equivalent of 50k riding per day"

### Clothing
- MTB shoes recommended (comfortable for walking, saves space vs separate shoes)
- Merino arm/leg warmers
- Down jacket
- Reflective rain jacket
- Reflective gilet

### Tools & Spares
- Multi-tool
- Mini pump
- Smart tire patches + tire boot
- Rear derailleur hanger
- Spare spokes
- Baby wipes + chamois cream

## Route Planning Wisdom

### Platform Preferences
- **Ride With GPS**: Best for road cycling route building, Google Street View integration
- **Komoot**: Good for surface type info, "bike touring" mode helpful
- **Strava Heatmaps**: Verify roads are actually used by cyclists
- **Google Maps**: Initial route sketching, Street View verification

### Planning Process
1. Enter mandatory parcours/checkpoints into Google Maps
2. Build detailed route in RideWithGPS
3. Check entire route with Strava heatmaps
4. Verify with satellite imagery and Street View
5. Export to Komoot to check surfaces
6. Load on primary and backup devices

### Route Philosophy
> "A flatter, more direct route will generally be busier and faster, but you can still be competitive while avoiding less enjoyable riding conditions."

> "Routing was key. Mine just wasn't good enough, with cobbled forest detours and aborted attempts at Swiss tunnels costing me many hours."

## Training Guidance

### Volume Benchmarks
- Elite level (Kristof Allegaert): 20,000+ km in 7 months before race
- Serious competitor: 15,000+ km
- Typical participant: 5,000-10,000 km in 6 months before
- Monthly breakdown: 500-1,000 km winter, 1,000-1,500 km spring/summer

### Training Philosophy
> "You cannot push extremely hard for 20-30 weeks - you will get bored, burnt out or broken. Build a repeatable week's training you can achieve for 18 out of 20 weeks."

> "Rides longer than about 4-6 hours don't yield additional gains. Very long rides take longer to recover from."

### Physical Demands
- 18-20 hours/day on bike
- Intensity mostly below aerobic threshold (LT1)
- 8,000-10,000 kcal burned per day
- Sleep deprivation
- Night riding
- Lots of climbing

### Experience Over Gadgets
> "Jana Kesenheimer didn't overhaul her training or chase marginal gains. Instead, she leaned on years of consistent volume. For an event that spans an entire continent, that kind of base IS race-specific training."

- Wildlife
- Poor road surfaces
- Landmines in Bosnia (marked areas)

## Mental Suffering

### The Reality of Suffering
> "My head was trying to force me to go to sleep at all costs... If I was pushing my bike up a hill, I would occasionally find myself stopping for no reason."

> "You just go through the hallucinations and enjoy it. Your brain is so tired, and you're going to see things whether you like it or not."

### Dark Moments
- Extreme loneliness
- Questioning why you're doing this
- Physical pain compounding mental exhaustion
- Quote: "The TCR is not a joke. This is a race where you can get hurt if you are not careful."

| **Elevation** | 9/10 | 40,000-64,000m - Massive climbing volume |
| **Technical Difficulty** | 6/10 | Primarily road, some gravel parcours |
| **Navigation Complexity** | 9/10 | Free route format, multiple countries |
| **Self-Sufficiency Requirement** | 10/10 | True self-supported racing |
| **Mental Challenge** | 10/10 | Sleep deprivation, decision fatigue, loneliness |
| **Weather Variability** | 9/10 | 0-40°C range, storms to heatwaves |
| **Prestige/Legacy** | 10/10 | Flagship European ultra race, Mike Hall legacy |
| **Community/Culture** | 9/10 | Strong dotwatcher following, respected field |
| **Accessibility** | 6/10 | Selective entry, requires application and experience |

## OVERALL GRAVEL GOD RATING: 9.0/10

### Rating Justification
The Transcontinental Race represents the pinnacle of European ultra-distance cycling. Its free-route format, mandatory self-support rules, and legendary status make it the benchmark against which all other European ultra races are measured. The Mike Hall legacy adds historical significance. Not a pure gravel race (primarily road-focused), but parcours include significant unpaved sections and the Balkans terrain demands gravel-ready equipment and mentality.

## Comparison to Other Ultra Races

| Race | Distance | Style | TCR Comparison |
|------|----------|-------|----------------|
| Tour Divide | 4,400 km | Fixed route, MTB/gravel | More technical terrain, single route |
| Trans Am | 6,800 km | Fixed route, road | Longer, fixed route vs free route |
| RAAM | 4,800 km | Supported team race | Support allowed, different category |
| Silk Road Mountain Race | 1,700 km | Fixed route, MTB | More technical, shorter, more remote |
| Trans Dinarica | 4,000 km | Route, gravel/MTB | Balkans-focused, more off-road |

## Who Should Consider TCR

# APPENDIX: KEY QUOTES

## On the Race Itself
> "The Transcontinental Race is a single stage race in which the clock never stops. Riders plan, research and navigate their own course and choose when and where to rest. They will take only what they can carry and consume only what they can find."

## On Suffering
> "You just go through the hallucinations and enjoy it. I mean, that's your entertainment. Your brain is so tired, and you're going to see things whether you like it or not."

## On Self-Support
> "No third-party support, resupply or lodgings is allowed. You can only rely on what you are bringing with you and on publicly accessible support like bike repair shops, hotels, and restaurants."

## On Mike Hall's Legacy
> "Mike Hall devised the Transcontinental Race and ran all editions until his tragic death in 2017. His spirit remains the beating heart of everything the organization does."

## On the Challenge
> "The most humbling of all of these results is that despite their best efforts, only about 60% of people who have started the Transcontinental Race have been able to finish."

## On Weather
> "The Transcontinental has really been two races. You have the Alps with the cold temperatures, then the Balkans and Eastern Europe with the heat and the rugged roads."

## On Preparation
> "You cannot push extremely hard for 20-30 weeks - you will get bored, burnt out or broken. The best gains in aerobic fitness and endurance come from consistent work over as long a period as possible."

## On Finishing
> "Both the physical strength - being fit enough to ride for so many hours everyday - and the mental strength - being disciplined and motivated enough to continue every morning - are essential. Neither are easy and finishing these events commands respect."
