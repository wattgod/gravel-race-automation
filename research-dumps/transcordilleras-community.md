## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Griffin Easter [ELITE]:** "The 1,030 km (640 mi) route was not what scared me, it was the 21,500m (70,538 ft) of climbing which did." Describing Stage 1's Chichamocha Canyon climb: "As soon as we reached the bottom, I quickly felt the heat creep in and start to slow everything down. On the way down, I had lost a bottle, drank a bottle and had half a bottle left. I quickly realized if I was going to stay in the race, I'd have to nurse this bidon to the finish." Won overall in 2024. (https://4iiii.com/blog/griffin-easter-transcordilleras/)

**Griffin Easter [ELITE]:** On Stage 2: "Marked as 45% paved and 55% gravel, that proved false. The day was actually closer to 95% gravel." On hydration strategy: "I entered Mogotes. I spotted a small tienda slammed the brakes and bought 1 liter of water, glass coke and mini coke. I smashed the glass coke, threw the rest in my pockets and got back on the chase." (https://4iiii.com/blog/griffin-easter-transcordilleras/)

**Griffin Easter [ELITE]:** On Stage 4 (175.6km): "Mini Unbound… yes that Unbound. The heat and humidity were at an all time high today... At 91 km we turned left and entered the never ending hell of dirt waves and humidity only rivaled by the Kansan summer Emporian Flint Hills. The air was dead, heavy and wrapped itself around every inch of your body. The speed was blistering and effort searingly painful. The gravel road was bone rattling with absolutely no rhythm whatsoever. The only way to ride was by turning a big gear and pushing into the bumps to try and smooth the road." (https://4iiii.com/blog/griffin-easter-transcordilleras/)

**Griffin Easter [ELITE]:** On the Queen Stage (Stage 5, 161.9km & 4,054m climbing): "With 13,300 ft of climbing and the previous 4 stages fatiguing the body, I woke up creaky and tired. Fortunately, with help from former legends like Annemiek Van Vleuten an accord was struck and for the first 66 km the entire peloton of 8 stage riders stuck together." On the final 20km climb to Guatapé: "So hot the only internal conversation you were trying to block out was your inner voice shouting, WATER!!!" (https://4iiii.com/blog/griffin-easter-transcordilleras/)

**Josh Ibbett [ELITE]:** Won TCRNo3 which finished in Istanbul. On returning for TCRNo10: "I always had it in my head that I'd like to do it again at some point... I know how to win it because I've done it so I know it is possible, but they're a different calibre of rider. I'm going to use every single piece of experience and knowledge to do what I can." (https://www.lostdot.cc/blog/the-transcontinental-race-no10-pre-race-report)

**Jaimi Wilson [ELITE]:** TCRNo9's fastest woman on her relaxed approach: "To be honest, I don't feel super prepared, but I never do. I'm the least organised person. I think the more of these I do, the more relaxed I seem to get. It's probably not a good thing... but I guess I know that I'm always capable of doing it." (https://www.lostdot.cc/blog/the-transcontinental-race-no10-pre-race-report)

**Cynthia Carson [ELITE]:** On entering her first TCR with impressive ultra palmarès including Transcordilleras: "I haven't spent a lot of time in the East of Europe, so I'm really looking forward to it... When I get to Türkiye, I'll just try and take it all in. I'll probably want to be done and I'll get to the finish as fast as I can, but it'll be a culturally unique experience to finish a 10-to-11-day bike race in Istanbul." Takes confidence from Fiona Kolbinger's 2019 TCR win: "If she can do it, so can I. That's how I live my life. If somebody else is out there doing it, I can do it too." (https://www.lostdot.cc/blog/the-transcontinental-race-no10-pre-race-report)

**Laurens ten Dam [ELITE]:** Former WorldTour pro on Stage 1: "I've never seen this before. We had like 100 kilometres on gravel and we did 5,000 metres of climbing. So if you do the math, it would be like 100k with 5 per cent climb... I had to walk my bike a few times; Pete [Stetina] did too. One time I crashed uphill because I couldn't get out of my pedal fast enough. That was like suffering to the max." On the final stretch: "The first 70km, me and Pete were basically together... Then the two of us, the climb started from 2,000 metres altitude, which is like 6,000 feet, to 3,800 metres, to the angels. It was such a long climb. I was suffering. I was just crawling to the finish." (https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/laurens-ten-dam-transcordilleras-is-old-school-racing/)

**Laurens ten Dam [ELITE]:** On Stage 2 and race tactics: "Basically, the front group of four guys stopped all together in the same shop. We each got like three bottles of water and a snack or something, so it's really old-school racing, like the Tour de France in the old days. Remember the pictures of people raiding bars to get their fluids in? So we were basically doing the same." On bike maintenance: "The bike was filthy after two days, so I found a car wash. I am happy I have a clean bike now." (https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/laurens-ten-dam-transcordilleras-is-old-school-racing/)

**Laurens ten Dam [ELITE]:** On Colombian hospitality: "So at the car wash, no one spoke English. I could tell them I needed my bike washed [in basic Spanish]. And they were running to help. One guy wanted to clean and to dry and to make a special foam, but I told him I had to go. Everyone is so nice here in Colombia. I haven't met a single grumpy person." Stage 1 finishing times: "riders rolling in after midnight. While he and Stetina completed that ride as a full eight-hour day of work, the majority of the field completed the stage in 10-12 hours and the final seven riders crossed the line after 17-19 hours." (https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/laurens-ten-dam-transcordilleras-is-old-school-racing/)

**Janosch Wintermantel [ELITE]:** On the Chingaza páramo (Stage 1): "I was riding with the race organizer, Mauricio, who was racing this year and cooking his way down the rough Chingaza descents. I was constantly thinking to myself, 'I'll never forget this ride'... Frailejon plants lined the roadside, the hillsides, and every place my eyes wandered... Riding above 10,000 feet for the middle 40 miles of the day dictated the pace." On the challenge: "The hardest thing about day one was trying to find a balance between managing my effort for the next 8 days of racing and trying to soak up all the beauty of the Chingaza." (https://gravelunion.cc/article/transcordilleras-colombian-adventure)

**Janosch Wintermantel [ELITE]:** On Stage 6 descending off Sumapaz: "The queen stage waited for us on stage 7, a monster 139km with 4000m of climbing in the Paramo. The stage started directly with a massive climb up to Sumapaz from 1500m to 3850m. As a comparison the highest paved pass in Europe is the mighty Col d'Iseran at 2764m, more than 1000 meters lower than many of the climbs in Colombia! Heavy rain and cold temperatures greeted us at the startline and we knew it would become a day to remember for every single rider." On mechanical disaster: "I suddenly got a massive hit in a rocky descent on my rear wheel. It was a miracle that I stay upright, but as a result my rear wheel was completely off set and my front and rear derailleurs stopped working entirely, which meant I was left with 1 gear and had 52km and more than 1000m of climbing left." (https://gravelunion.cc/article/transcordilleras-colombian-adventure)

**Julian Manrique [ELITE/UNKNOWN - won non-stop 2023]:** On Stage 1: "As the race started, I quickly realized that the mountains were unforgiving and the gravel was much tougher than I had anticipated. Even though I'm familiar with the gravel I could encounter, I found myself struggling to keep up with the pace and had to walk up steep segments more than a few times... The quick change of scenery kept me going further, and as the sun began to fade, the route shifted into an endless gravel maze... It took me 23 hours to reach the first checkpoint in Salento." On rest strategy: "The restaurant owner noticed my need for rest and offered me an empty space with a piece of cardboard to lie on. Despite feeling exhausted and sleepy, I couldn't shake off the fear of losing my lead... After about 30 minutes of rest, I decided to continue. I had never been in the lead position in a race until that day." (https://bikepacking.com/plog/transcordilleras-2023-recap/)

**Julian Manrique [ELITE/UNKNOWN]:** On la Linea descent: "The gravel descent segment of la linea was one of the toughest parts of the race... It felt like the soil wanted me to stay forever, and the harder I pedaled, the harder it became. While most of the section was a descent, steep climbs would suddenly appear out of nowhere, as though the mountain was playing games with me... The descent took me the whole day to complete, slowly making my way 80 kilometers downward through the mountains of the Central Andes." On reaching checkpoint 2: "At long last, I arrived at the hotel of checkpoint two in the early hours of the morning, exhausted and in pain. As I removed my socks, I couldn't help but notice how disgusting they were... I managed to get three hours of sleep before setting off once again." (https://bikepacking.com/plog/transcordilleras-2023-recap/)

**Julian Manrique [ELITE/UNKNOWN]:** On the 80km climb after checkpoint 2: "The next leg of the race presented a formidable challenge: an 80-kilometer climb that was divided into two massive mountains. The sun was already high in the sky, and the heat was intense, a result of Colombia's varied thermal levels. The climbs were steep and unrelenting, leaving no opportunity for rest. To avoid getting too fatigued, I had to slow down my pace and preserve my heart rate." (https://bikepacking.com/plog/transcordilleras-2023-recap/)

**Austin Sullivan [ELITE/COMPETITIVE]:** On Alto del Sifón (longest paved climb in the world): "Stage 5 was a short and sweet stage out of Manizales really brought out the full gas racing. After riding up climbs that took two or three hours, it was a serious breath of fresh air to have a two-hour stage that was over in a flash." On reaching Manizales after 8,000ft climb: "There is a lot to be said about the climbs, but with each up comes another down, and the descent off of Sifón was delicious. Big sweeping curves built into jungle hill sides eventually gave way to the big city of Manizales." (https://obedbikes.com/blogs/stories/austin-sullivans-return-to-transcordilleras-2025)

**Austin Sullivan [ELITE/COMPETITIVE]:** On Stage 4 mud: "The ride out of town was dry and fun. The peloton got strung out immediately, and I never saw the front of the race... And then came the mud. This wasn't anything like mud we had experienced in prior stages. This mud was deep and it provided no visual cues as to where it was firm or more akin to sticky peanut butter. After a couple of minor washouts, I managed to keep riding while others were walking or completely stopped trying to fish their chain out of their mud-riddled frames... I did end up walking one small section, but it was short-lived, and I was able to ride my way through, thanking myself for the 1x drivetrain (nearly everyone who was stopped had a 2x...)." (https://obedbikes.com/blogs/stories/austin-sullivans-return-to-transcordilleras-2025)

**Iris (from iris.cc blog) [ELITE - former pro]:** On the reality check: "With no time to rest and recover from the journey we hit the roads/trails at the pace of a race-ready pro!! Quite the reality check! Diana took me for a few beautiful rides in the area, with the climb of Cerro Gualí being an absolute highlight for me. And high it was! A brutal, but stunning, 32 km of climbing (mostly off road) and 2000 mtr of elevation gain, to finish on the highest paved road in Colombia (4000 mtr)." On altitude: "If you have never ridden at altitude I can tell you that it's pretty hard for the body to ride above 3000 mtr and both Diana and I felt rubbish on the last part. The lack of oxygen makes you feel dizzy and just weird in general." (https://iris.cc/stories/colombian-gravel-adventure)

**Iris [ELITE - former pro]:** On Stage 1: "We knew right away that if this was just an appetizer, this rally was going to be even more brutal than previously imagined. I spent most of the day riding through the Chicamocha Canyon (the second largest canyon in the world) and rode up a punishing climb of 12 km to finally reach the finish after spending 9 hrs on the bike. Although I'd been suffering like a dog, I also really enjoyed it. The stunning landscape, the conversations with the other participants and the fact that I didn't have to think about anything other than riding my bike, eating and drinking." On alternating struggles with Annemiek van Vleuten: "The rest of the week Annemiek and I would pretty much have alternate good days and bad days which meant there was always one of us that could encourage the other, be in charge of snacks and ice cream distribution and laugh about this crazy adventure we called a 'holiday'!" (https://iris.cc/stories/colombian-gravel-adventure)

**Iris [ELITE - former pro]:** On the final stage: "On the last stage, there was a decent amount of tarmac and that meant this should have been the easiest one. However, my completely empty body and the extreme heat meant otherwise.. It was probably the hardest stage for me, but thanks to my riding companions I made it to Santa Fe de Antioquia." Overall reflection: "It might not have been the most 'relaxed' holiday, but sometimes it's just THE BEST to go home with an empty body and a full heart. Colombia and its people have definitely secured a place in mine." (https://iris.cc/stories/colombian-gravel-adventure)

**Pete Stetina [ELITE]:** On why he chose Transcordilleras: "The gravel world is so vast and there's so many different events and they're all so different. I really do love the gravel stages races. My bread and butter was stage racing. I think it's a great way to see an area. While gravel is very U.S. centric, I think there's a lot of adventure to be had abroad." (https://sports.yahoo.com/transcordilleras-crossing-andes-via-gravel-160024153.html)

**Mauricio Ordonez [Race Director]:** On the race format: "Only in Colombia does it [the Andes] do this. And our main goal is to cross all three ranges. We do this from east to west, almost 1,110 kilometers and about 28,000 meters of elevation gain." On community impact: "We're also going into some very small towns. If the race goes through there, they'll have input into the economy. A lot of these towns don't have any tourism at all, so in a way we're trying to promote a local economy in these towns, which are very secluded, forgotten towns. Some are 1,000 people maximum, so a caravan of 100 cyclists is the best weekend they'll have for the rest of the year." (https://sports.yahoo.com/transcordilleras-crossing-andes-via-gravel-160024153.html)

**Christoph Strasser [ELITE]:** Two-time TCR winner attempting third consecutive win at TCRNo10: "I'm definitely feeling well prepared, but of course, there is a little bit of nervousness because there are so many things that can happen and there are new countries we have to ride through, so it will be very exciting... I'm a little bit afraid of the number four Parcours in Türkiye, the off-road section, because I'm always a little bit afraid of the off-road section. It will be a big challenge, there is just no information at all and if you check the Strava heat map, you see that nobody has ever ridden there before." (https://www.lostdot.cc/blog/the-transcontinental-race-no10-pre-race-report)

**Robin Gemperle [ELITE]:** 2nd at TCRNo9, on his third major ultra attempt: "It's my third really big race and last year was the very first attempt in actually going for a win in a major race. I think it just makes sense that now with the third attempt, chances are way higher than they have been last year." (https://www.lostdot.cc/blog/the-transcontinental-race-no10-pre-race-report)

**Tim de Witte [ELITE]:** TCRNo9 third place overall and Green Leaderboard winner on pressure: "I think there might be a few contenders for the first place, so I think it will be a big battle in the beginning... I think I have spent more time than the two previous years combined on making my route, maybe it's because I feel the pressure not to screw this up. I want to do as well as I did last year, I want to be at the same level again." (https://www.lostdot.cc/blog/the-transcontinental-race-no10-pre-race-report)

**Alex Kopp [ELITE]:** Fresh off winning the first Accursed Race, on his first TCR: "I feel quite comfortable to be in unsupported bike race mode because of doing the Atlas Mountain Race in February, then in May The Accursed, but this race is completely different. I have never planned such a long route on tarmac and I'm doing it for the first time, whereas Robin and Christoph have done it for the last two or three years, so they know what they are doing." (https://www.lostdot.cc/blog/the-transcontinental-race-no10-pre-race-report)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**[ELITE] Bike Choice - Hardtail MTB vs Gravel:** Cristian Yepes ran a hardtail mountain bike and "on the descent took off. We managed to hold his wheel for the first few kilometers, but eventually he disappeared. The rest of us were running gravel bikes." Griffin Easter (overall winner) noted this gave Yepes a significant advantage on technical descents throughout the race. (https://4iiii.com/blog/griffin-easter-transcordilleras/)

**[ELITE] Drivetrain - 1x Advantage:** Austin Sullivan on Stage 4 mud: "I was able to ride my way through, thanking myself for the 1x drivetrain (nearly everyone who was stopped had a 2x...)." The mud was so thick it jammed front derailleurs. (https://obedbikes.com/blogs/stories/austin-sullivans-return-to-transcordilleras-2025)

**[ELITE] Clothing - Don't Overpack:** Griffin Easter: "I decided to bring the puffy jacket, I did NOT need the puffy." This was for the 2024 edition starting in Paipa. (https://4iiii.com/blog/griffin-easter-transcordilleras/)

**[ELITE] Suspension Choice:** Alex Howes rode with "a suspension fork and MTB tires" during the 2025 edition, suggesting some elite riders opted for more capable setups. (https://obedbikes.com/blogs/stories/austin-sullivans-return-to-transcordilleras-2025)

**[ELITE] Electronic Shifting Vulnerability:** Janosch Wintermantel experienced complete failure of electronic derailleurs after a hit in rocky descent: "my rear wheel was completely off set and my front and rear derailleurs stopped working entirely, which meant I was left with 1 gear and had 52km and more than 1000m of climbing left." He noted at the bike shop: "The bike shop owner had simply never put his hand on any electronic gears before." (https://gravelunion.cc/article/transcordilleras-colombian-adventure)

**[ELITE] Tire Durability Issues:** Janosch Wintermantel: "The hole I got in my tyre from the previous day opened up again, but this time I couldn't properly seal it. As a result, I had to ride the entire stage on extremely low tyre pressure, stopped countless times to put extra air in and I lost almost an hour to Laurens." (https://gravelunion.cc/article/transcordilleras-colombian-adventure)

## Weather Experienced

**2024 Edition - Extreme Heat:** Griffin Easter reported heat as the defining challenge. Stage 1 at Chichamocha Canyon bottom: "I quickly felt the heat creep in and start to slow everything down." Stage 3: "The heat still hadn't turned down. It was clear that the high temps and humidity were a part of this year's edition." Stage 4: "The heat and humidity were at an all time high today... The air was dead, heavy and wrapped itself around every inch of your body." Compared it to "Kansan summer Emporian Flint Hills." Stage 5 final climb: "So hot the only internal conversation you were trying to block out was your inner voice shouting, WATER!!!" (https://4iiii.com/blog/griffin-easter-transcordilleras/)

**2022 Edition - Rain at Start:** Laurens ten Dam: Stage 2 began with "heavy rains that only intensified while we ate breakfast. Fortunately, it subsided, but I don't think many of us knew that the aftermath from all that rain would become the focus of the day" (leading to extreme mud conditions). (https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/laurens-ten-dam-transcordilleras-is-old-school-racing/)

**2023 Edition - Queen Stage Weather:** Janosch Wintermantel on Stage 7 (Sumapaz páramo): "Heavy rain and cold temperatures greeted us at the startline... I crossed the first of the two 3850m climbs after almost 3 hours of climbing... When we crossed the second of the two Paramo climbs it was pouring down again with temperatures of less than 5 degrees Celsius at the top. Laurens managed to get a small gap on us... The sun came out and the lower altitude made me rediscover my strength." Dramatic temperature swings from <5°C at 3850m to much warmer at lower elevations. (https://gravelunion.cc/article/transcordilleras-colombian-adventure)

**Altitude Effects on Weather:** Iris (former pro): "If you have never ridden at altitude I can tell you that it's pretty hard for the body to ride above 3000 mtr... The lack of oxygen makes you feel dizzy and just weird in general." On Chingaza at 10,000+ feet: "the fog and low passing clouds set the stage... Breaks in the fog would open up views of rounded mountains." (https://iris.cc/stories/colombian-gravel-adventure)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Chichamocha Canyon (Stage 1):** Griffin Easter: "Ranked as the second largest canyon in the world to that of The Grand Canyon, we descended and climbed back out. The descent seemed like it lasted hours." Iris described it as "spending most of the day riding through the Chichamocha Canyon... and rode up a punishing climb of 12 km to finally reach the finish." (https://4iiii.com/blog/griffin-easter-transcordilleras/ and https://iris.cc/stories/colombian-gravel-adventure)

**Paving vs Gravel Discrepancy:** Griffin Easter Stage 2: "Marked as 45% paved and 55% gravel, that proved false. The day was actually closer to 95% gravel." (https://4iiii.com/blog/griffin-easter-transcordilleras/)

**Gradient Extremes:** Griffin Easter Stage 2: "terrains that had ups and downs with some inclines kicking up to 28%." (https://4iiii.com/blog/griffin-easter-transcordilleras/)

**Stage 4 Gravel Surface Quality:** Griffin Easter: "The gravel road was bone rattling with absolutely no rhythm whatsoever. The only way to ride was by turning a big gear and pushing into the bumps to try and smooth the road." Compared it directly to Unbound Gravel and "Kansan summer Emporian Flint Hills." (https://4iiii.com/blog/griffin-easter-transcordilleras/)

**Colombian Gravel vs International Standards:** Janosch Wintermantel: "Colombian gravel is not comparable to the smooth surface most of us are used to in Europe or the US." Julian Manrique: "I quickly realized that the mountains were unforgiving and the gravel was much tougher than I had anticipated. Even though I'm familiar with the gravel I could encounter, I found myself struggling to keep up with the pace and had to walk up steep segments more than a few times." (https://gravelunion.cc/article/transcordilleras-colombian-adventure and https://bikepacking.com/plog/transcordilleras-2023-recap/)

**Chingaza National Park (Stage 1):** Austin Sullivan on the 7,000-foot climb: "As we ascended... the fog and low passing clouds set the stage... Breaks in the fog would open up views of rounded mountains, all devoid of trees but absolutely jammed full of plant life... Frailejon plants lined the roadside, the hillsides, and every place my eyes wandered... Riding above 10,000 feet for the middle 40 miles of the day dictated the pace... The roads were moist but not soggy, made up of hard-packed dirt with small embedded riverstones." (https://obedbikes.com/blogs/stories/austin-sullivans-return-to-transcordilleras-2025)

**Magdalena River Valley:** Austin Sullivan: "Being lower in elevation, the river valley is also known for its stifling heat, and the city of Honda lived up to expectations. Nearly every local I spoke to about the route would exhale a big sigh each time I mentioned we would be passing through Honda, a nonverbal warning about its heat and humidity." Julian Manrique noted seeing "the golden reflection of the sunset on the Magdalena River before the gravel segment appeared before me, seemingly endless and unyielding." (https://obedbikes.com/blogs/stories/austin-sullivans-return-to-transcordilleras-2025 and https://bikepacking.com/plog/transcordilleras-2023-recap/)

**Alto del Sifón:** Austin Sullivan: "the longest paved climb in the world, Alto del Sifón. From Armero to the top of the climb is some 60 miles and over 13,000ft of gain. Lucky for us, the climb is split over two days, with the second half passing through another of Colombia's páramos and skirting the edge of the volcano Nevado Ruiz." (https://obedbikes.com/blogs/stories/austin-sullivans-return-to-transcordilleras-2025)

**Sumapaz Páramo (Queen Stage):** Janosch Wintermantel: "The stage started directly with a massive climb up to Sumapaz from 1500m to 3850m. As a comparison the highest paved pass in Europe is the mighty Col d'Iseran at 2764m, more than 1000 meters lower than many of the climbs in Colombia!" Stage was 139km with 4000m of climbing, featuring two separate climbs to 3850m. (https://gravelunion.cc/article/transcordilleras-colombian-adventure)

**La Linea Descent:** Julian Manrique: "The gravel descent segment of la linea was one of the toughest parts of the race... It felt like the soil wanted me to stay forever, and the harder I pedaled, the harder it became. While most of the section was a descent, steep climbs would suddenly appear out of nowhere, as though the mountain was playing games with me... The descent took me the whole day to complete, slowly making my way 80 kilometers downward through the mountains of the Central Andes." (https://bikepacking.com/plog/transcordilleras-2023-recap/)

**Road Conditions in Towns:** Griffin Easter Stage 3: "We flew through the town which was a maze of narrow steep streets, traffic, dogs, chickens, people, motos and out the other side of town I found myself glued to Finsterwald's wheel descending a twisting, high speed, ever changing road conditions maze." Also: "a cow had jumped out in front and began sprinting downhill in front of me. He leaped off the road, slamming into barbed wire." (https://4iiii.com/blog/griffin-easter-transcordilleras/)

**Stage 4 Descent Quality:** Austin Sullivan on leaving Honda: "The ride out of town was dry and fun. The peloton got strung out immediately... The course ran alongside the Magdalena for 30 miles or so, undulating with short and steep pitches that led into paths cut by cattle." (https://obedbikes.com/blogs/stories/austin-sullivans-return-to-transcordilleras-2025)

**Armero Historical Site:** Austin Sullivan: "Towards the end of this mud, the soil became firmer... As we exited the dirt, we passed by the former town of Armero. Tragically, in 1985, a mudslide triggered by a volcanic eruption wiped away 20-25,000 residents, and all that was left was a cemetery. This tragic event led to big changes in emergency warning systems in Colombia, even though the volcano was some 60 miles away." (https://obedbikes.com/blogs/stories/austin-sullivans-return-to-transcordilleras-2025)

**Open Traffic Racing:** Janosch Wintermantel: "The race takes place in open traffic with huge potholes, dogs chasing you and cows standing in your way all on your daily menu." Stage 5 finish: "The last 3 kilometres were then a crazy hunt in open traffic. Mauricio Ardila attacked first. We passed cars left and right, sprinted in front of oncoming buses, cut off a police car to then sprint it out in the last meters." (https://gravelunion.cc/article/transcordilleras-colombian-adventure)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**[ELITE] Conservative First Day Approach:** Griffin Easter on Stage 1: "I knew the race was long so instead of burying myself the first day, I decided to hold my cards." Despite being in contention for the stage win, he opted to finish 2nd rather than overcook himself. "My goal was to try and win the GC, so my efforts each day were based on the overall race and staying consistent." (https://4iiii.com/blog/griffin-easter-transcordilleras/)

**[ELITE] GC vs Stage Racing Mindset:** Griffin Easter on Stage 4: "I was leading the GC and Finsterwald was far down on time. My goal was to try and win the GC, so my efforts each day were based on the overall race and staying consistent. Russell went up the road and we kept a steady pace for the next 3 hours." He let Finsterwald take the stage win while protecting overall time. (https://4iiii.com/blog/griffin-easter-transcordilleras/)

**[ELITE/UNKNOWN] Non-Stop Format Sleep Strategy:** Julian Manrique on reaching checkpoint 1 after 23 hours: "The restaurant owner noticed my need for rest and offered me an empty space with a piece of cardboard to lie on. Despite feeling exhausted and sleepy, I couldn't shake off the fear of losing my lead. I was in shock, and my mind was still racing, making it impossible to get any sleep. After about 30 minutes of rest, I decided to continue." At checkpoint 2: "I managed to get three hours of sleep before setting off once again." His minimal sleep strategy (3.5 total hours across first two checkpoints) was driven by fear of losing the lead.
