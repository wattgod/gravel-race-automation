# TRANSROCKIES GRAVEL ROYALE — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Brenna Pauly [ELITE]:** "Stage 4, the final queen stage, 130 km and 2100 m of climbing was hands down one of the top five hardest bike races I have ever done. The course was unrelenting with big climbs and technical descents." (https://pacificcyclingcentre.ca/news/transrockies-gravel-royale/)

**Andrew Davidson [RECREATIONAL]:** "TRGR was a fabulous event, with incredible attention to detail and positive energy from all involved. Awesome courses in one of the most beautiful locations in the Canadian Rockies. This race was tough, but a lifetime highlight for me!" (https://4iiii.com/blog/2024-gravel-royale/)

**Jeremy LaMothe [UNKNOWN]:** "Being centered out of Nipika was great. Originally I was apprehensive about it because it wasn't really in the spirit of a traveling stage race, but having the Chillville in Nipika turned out fantastic. What a great place." (https://www.transrockiesgravelroyale.com/)

**Carter Nieuwesteeg [COMPETITIVE]:** "Overall loved the event and the team behind it. You guys rocked it, and it's truly inspiring to see the passion every TR crew member put into it. Just wow. The camping vibes at Nipika were immaculate and it was really awesome hanging with such a range of riders every day in Chillville - plus the evening games were awesome and really kept people around. Very eager to come back next year for the full course experience." (https://www.transrockiesgravelroyale.com/)

**Rach McBride [ELITE]:** "This race is definitely unlike anything else I have experienced in gravel racing so far. The courses, the multi-day aspect and the tent camping, it really all has been a fantastic experience and so fun to be surrounded by the gravel community all week." (https://www.granfondoguide.com/Contents/Index/6869/inaugural-transrockies-gravel-royale-)

**Rob Britton [ELITE]:** "This was my first gravel stage race and the group from TransRockies did a heck of a job taking care of us. Done and dusted and happy to get a win at this race and my first win as a gravel pro." (https://www.granfondoguide.com/Contents/Index/6869/inaugural-transrockies-gravel-royale-)

**Cory Wallace [ELITE]:** "The meaning of life is to have fun. I traveled to Nepal and Africa last year. People in Nepal aren't wondering what the meaning of life is. They are just trying to survive... We live easy lives, and should enjoy them." (https://theradavist.com/2022-transrockies-gravel-royale)

**Andrew Davidson [RECREATIONAL]:** "After being smoked out last year, from the nearby forest fires, it was looking like a similar and unfortunate script again this year... However, the never-say-die organizers and course designers pulled off a late game miracle to successfully host the second edition." (https://4iiii.com/blog/2024-gravel-royale/)

**Barry Wicks [ELITE]:** On Stage 2 mechanical: "An ill-timed mechanical failure 45 minutes later (snapped rear derailleur cable) at the base of the day's biggest climb demoted me from gravel cyclist to trail runner with a bike for most of the 7 km ascent." (https://4iiii.com/blog/transrockies-gravel-royale/?srsltid=AfmBOoreYq8FtvkJwwNSaGEzgaU54BnptTlmUHcoS7NEIw6VNkJRKPmS)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Dropper Post Consideration [UNKNOWN]:** Multiple riders overheard saying "I should've run a dropper post" after technical sections. One rider noted: "I've never ridden something like that on a mountain bike, let alone a gravel bike before." (https://4iiii.com/blog/transrockies-gravel-royale/?srsltid=AfmBOoreYq8FtvkJwwNSaGEzgaU54BnptTlmUHcoS7NEIw6VNkJRKPmS)

**Double Chainrings [ELITE]:** Andrew Davidson credits his double chainring setup for salvaging Stage 2 after his derailleur cable snapped: "I made the most of my now 2-speed set-up (thank god for double-chainrings) and limited my losses by time-trialling the remaining kilometres." (https://4iiii.com/blog/transrockies-gravel-royale/?srsltid=AfmBOoreYq8FtvkJwwNSaGEzgaU54BnptTlmUHcoS7NEIw6VNkJRKPmS)

**Riding Glasses [ALL LEVELS]:** Chief Medical Officer Mackenzie Wardle recommends wearing riding glasses after irrigating "a dozen or so riders' eyes that had been irritated by wind and dust" at a previous 80% gravel TransRockies event. (https://www.transrockiesgravelroyale.com/stage-stories/rider-safety-with-mack)

**Bear Spray Carry System [ALL LEVELS]:** Wardle warns that bear spray cans can puncture in crashes if carried in jersey pockets or exposed on bikes. He recommends using a "Scat belt or bear (not beer) cozie" instead. (https://www.transrockiesgravelroyale.com/stage-stories/rider-safety-with-mack)

**Emergency Gear Required [ALL LEVELS]:** Cycling helmet, emergency blanket, and long finger gloves are mandatory equipment each day. (https://www.transrockiesgravelroyale.com/stage-stories/rider-safety-with-mack)

**Saddle Bag Losses [ELITE]:** Andrew Davidson's "multi-tool-equipped saddle bag cashed-in its chips and departed from my saddle no more than 500 m into the fast and frantic downhill start" of Stage 2. He also lost tubes and CO2 cartridge from jersey pockets on rough terrain. (https://4iiii.com/blog/transrockies-gravel-royale/?srsltid=AfmBOoreYq8FtvkJwwNSaGEzgaU54BnptTlmUHcoS7NEIw6VNkJRKPmS)

## Weather Experienced

**2024 Edition:** Forest fires were a concern again after the previous year's smoke-out. Organizers made a "late game miracle" course reroute to avoid active controlled burns. (https://4iiii.com/blog/2024-gravel-royale/)

**Stage 3 Night Weather (Year Unknown):** Barry Wicks reported: "The thunder and lightning lacked conviction. So did the rain. The night's slumber was only lightly interrupted to acknowledge the brief anger of the clouds." (https://theradavist.com/2022-transrockies-gravel-royale)

**Stage 4 Conditions (2022):** "A rain-soaked course that sapped the legs that little bit extra" with "limited vision through my mud-splattered glasses." (https://4iiii.com/blog/transrockies-gravel-royale/?srsltid=AfmBOoreYq8FtvkJwwNSaGEzgaU54BnptTlmUHcoS7NEIw6VNkJRKPmS)

**General Mountain Weather:** Chief Medical Officer warns: "In the mountains, weather moves fast. Rain can turn quickly into snow, especially on passes." Expect temperatures "above 30 degrees celsius and below zero" with climates ranging from "high desert to sub-alpine." Morning starts, evenings, and mountain passes are "considerably cooler." (https://www.transrockiesgravelroyale.com/stage-stories/rider-safety-with-mack)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Surface Composition:** The 2022 inaugural edition was 84% gravel road, 10% pavement, 5% double track, and 1% single track. Despite single track being only 1% of total distance, it had outsized impact on rider experience and bike choice discussions. (https://4iiii.com/blog/transrockies-gravel-royale/?srsltid=AfmBOoreYq8FtvkJwwNSaGEzgaU54BnptTlmUHcoS7NEIw6VNkJRKPmS)

**Stage 1 Technical Section [ALL LEVELS]:** Brenna Pauly describes: "The 'climb' quickly turned into a rocky double track that eventually became very difficult to ride. To the point that everyone was off their bikes and hiking. The hiking continued into some even steeper single track." Followed by a "spectacular vista and a long winding gravel descent." After technical sections came "30 km home on wide open roads." (https://pacificcyclingcentre.ca/news/transrockies-gravel-royale/)

**Stage 1 Hike-a-Bike:** Barry Wicks describes "The hike-a-bike section, following an old first nations hunting route, deposits riders into the Kootenay River Basin. A scary, off-camber and rooted descent soon rewards riders with free speed on the lower slopes as the road bed improves and the turns straighten out." (https://theradavist.com/2022-transrockies-gravel-royale)

**Stage 2 Technical Descent [ELITE]:** Brenna Pauly: "Over the top and it was a technical 4 km downhill single-track section. It was super-fast with some creek crossings, but I kept it rubber side down." (https://pacificcyclingcentre.ca/news/transrockies-gravel-royale/)

**Stage 2 Start:** Andrew Davidson: "Stage two began with ominous foreshadowing as my multi-tool-equipped saddle bag cashed-in its chips and departed from my saddle no more than 500 m into the fast and frantic downhill start." (https://4iiii.com/blog/transrockies-gravel-royale/?srsltid=AfmBOoreYq8FtvkJwwNSaGEzgaU54BnptTlmUHcoS7NEIw6VNkJRKPmS)

**Stage 3 Mud Washout [ELITE]:** Brenna Pauly: "Again, the climb got extremely steep at the end and we had to navigate some fresh sludge that washed out the route the night before." (https://pacificcyclingcentre.ca/news/transrockies-gravel-royale/)

**Forest Service Roads:** Event President Aaron McConnell describes the remote logging roads: "long sections of forest service roads... super remote- [they] had a great riding surface, hard, fast, smooth- built to a really high standard for logging trucks. The logging companies would use them for a season or two and then they actually don't get very much traffic for a while." (https://www.transrockiesgravelroyale.com/stage-stories/the-transrockies-stage-race-legacy)

**Wildlife Count:** One rider reported counting "47 piles of bear shit" on the road during Stage 1. (https://theradavist.com/2022-transrockies-gravel-royale)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Elite Men's Tactical Racing [ELITE]:** The 2024 race became a "tactical battle" with the Quebec duo "Poutine Mafia" (Alexis Cartier and Julien Gagne) going off the front on both Stage 1 and 2. On Stage 2, chasers organized with Cory Wallace bridging up with help from Carter Nieuwesteeg. Cartier won both stages. (https://cyclingmagazine.ca/gravel/2024-transrockies-gravel-royale-stage-2/)

**Elite Women's Momentum Shift [ELITE]:** While Chelsee Pummel had "clear ground" on Stage 1, Lindsay Glassford closed to "well under a minute behind" on Stage 2, suggesting she was "gaining momentum" despite Pummel's 7-minute overall lead going into Stage 3. (https://cyclingmagazine.ca/gravel/2024-transrockies-gravel-royale-stage-2/)

**Nutrition Guidelines [ALL LEVELS - GENERAL]:** Chief Medical Officer recommends "around 200-250 calories and one bottle of water or sports mix per hour" with an "emergency gel, bar or other sweet treat on hand." Aid stations stocked with "GU energy products, fruit, and other delectables" at strategic locations. (https://www.transrockiesgravelroyale.com/stage-stories/rider-safety-with-mack)

**Off-Bike Nutrition Warning [ALL LEVELS]:** Wardle warns against eating only energy bars off the bike: "While multi-day long distance dirt surfing will have your metabolism singing, Wardle recalls some riders of the TransRockies Classic continuing to eat energy bars as calorie replenishment off the bike. Without a necessary counterbalance of fresh, light greens, this doesn't set you up well. Too much dense food can make your gut's natural rhythm of digestion stall out." (https://www.transrockiesgravelroyale.com/stage-stories/rider-safety-with-mack)

**Group Riding Strategy [ELITE]:** Brenna Pauly on Stage 3: "My goal for the day was to get in a good group early on... Off the decent though I found a few others and we worked well together to catch groups of two in front of us. We settled into a good rhythm and picked up the pace after the second check point, dropping the one other girl that was with us." Notes: "One of the cool things of gravel racing is being able to work with a wide range of people in the race all with a common goal." (https://pacificcyclingcentre.ca/news/transrockies-gravel-royale/)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Mechanical Failures [ELITE]:** Andrew Davidson experienced: Stage 2 snapped rear derailleur cable "at the base of the day's biggest climb" forcing him to run-hike most of 7km ascent. Stage 3 dropped chain jammed between frame and crankset, warping several chain links. Stage 4 flat tire that wouldn't seal, followed by discovery that CO2 and tube had fallen out of jersey pocket. (https://4iiii.com/blog/transrockies-gravel-royale/?srsltid=AfmBOoreYq8FtvkJwwNSaGEzgaU54BnptTlmUHcoS7NEIw6VNkJRKPmS)

**Carrying Sufficient Spares [ALL LEVELS]:** Andrew Davidson's Stage 4: "I could see the race lead riding away from me, literally and figuratively, as I took a nature break and waited for more riders to come by, ideally with some parts to spare. A generous rider hooked me up, and some 15-20 minutes later, I was rolling again." (https://4iiii.com/blog/transrockies-gravel-royale/?srsltid=AfmBOoreYq8FtvkJwwNSaGEzgaU54BnptTlmUHcoS7NEIw6VNkJRKPmS)

**Creek Crossing Mishaps [ELITE]:** Brenna Pauly: "I lost the group I was with on the decent, when I bobbled in a creek crossing." (https://pacificcyclingcentre.ca/news/transrockies-gravel-royale/)

**Deer Collision:** One rider had a "collision with a deer" requiring self-rescue. (https://4iiii.com/blog/2024-gravel-royale/)

**Heat Management [ALL LEVELS]:** Medical Chief warns: "Sunscreen will keep you from getting heat stroke, something that could essentially burn you out of the race." (https://www.transrockiesgravelroyale.com/stage-stories/rider-safety-with-mack)

**Saddle Sores [ALL LEVELS]:** Wardle emphasizes getting out of bike shorts immediately after stages: "Get that skin dry, clean and put on loose fitting clothes... Acquiring a 'saddle sore' can derail your experience and is for the most part, avoidable. Just like ride food, chamois time is for riding time only." (https://www.transrockiesgravelroyale.com/stage-stories/rider-safety-with-mack)

**Water Trough Crash [ELITE]:** Andrew Davidson on Stage 4: "I was close to my limits as I missed seeing a water trough on a little descent and went straight into it. I twisted my handlebars which took me a few minutes to untwist." (https://4iiii.com/blog/transrockies-gravel-royale/?srsltid=AfmBOoreYq8FtvkJwwNSaGEzgaU54BnptTlmUHcoS7NEIw6VNkJRKPmS)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Basecamp Life at Nipika:** Andrew Davidson describes: "With cabins, tents, campfires, a swimming pond, vendor booths, massage therapists, and coolers full of beverages, all nestled among the looming mountains and surrounding forest, it was the perfect host site for what is essentially 'summer bike camp' for adults. Mix in the communal dining hall, where we'd gather for pre-dawn breakfasts and post-race dinners, complete with daily photo and video recaps, there was no shortage of opportunities to make new friends from around the world and swap tales from the trails." (https://4iiii.com/blog/2024-gravel-royale/)

**"ChillVille" Post-Race Scene:** Described as the gathering spot with campfires, "a perfect post-race set-up for swapping stories from the day." Barry Wicks mentions "post-race swimming pond and beer-equipped 'Chill Zone'" as central to social life. (https://4iiii.com/blog/2024-gravel-royale/ and https://4iiii.com/blog/transrockies-gravel-royale/?srsltid=AfmBOoreYq8FtvkJwwNSaGEzgaU54BnptTlmUHcoS7NEIw6VNkJRKPmS)

**Wide Range of Rider Motivations:** Andrew Davidson: "The beauty of an event like the Gravel Royale is the wide range of riders and motivations for partaking. At the pointy end of the field you've got pro road, gravel and mountain bike racers... At the rear end of the field, you have equally brave riders embarking on their first gravel race, first stage race, first day out with over 1500m of elevation, and the competition is focused on who can have the most fun, take the best pictures and collect the best stories. Whether the stage took 3hrs or 7hrs to complete, each rider got their moneysworth of challenges and triumphs each day." (https://4iiii.com/blog/2024-gravel-royale/)

**Self-Sufficient Yet Supported Balance:** Andrew Davidson: "The balance of self-sustaining and staff-supported was also managed perfectly for an event of this nature... having an experienced team of trail marshalls, mobile medics and aid station hype teams was a greatly appreciated and utilized safety net. It certainly allowed myself and others to ride with a greater sense of freedom, knowing that even while you're cutting through a section of dense bush, in what seems like the middle of nowhere, you're ultimately not alone!" (https://4iiii.com/blog/2024-gravel-royale/)

**Evening Programs:** Carter Nieuwesteeg mentions "the evening games were awesome and really kept people around" in ChillVille. (https://www.transrockiesgravelroyale.com/)

**Inaugural Event Scale:** 2022 edition saw "200 athletes from eight countries and 22 states and provinces." (https://www.granfondoguide.com/Contents/Index/6869/inaugural-transrockies-gravel-royale-)

**Course Rerouting Flexibility:** Multiple references to organizers adapting courses due to forest fires, with altered courses creating "more interactions with your fellow riders and chance to offer up encouragement and/or heckles" through out-and-back sections. (https://4iiii.com/blog/2024-gravel-royale/)

**Family Component:** 2021 planning included a "Fair Deal Family Mountain Bike Challenge" on Stage 2 day at Nipika, designed as "a fun and friendly 10 km loop" for kids and adults supporting racers. (https://www.transrockiesgravelroyale.com/stage-stories/robert-savin-on-exploring-transrockies-gravel)

**Wildlife Encounters:** Chief Medical Officer Mackenzie Wardle: "On occasion we'll ride around, you know, grizzly bears and stuff like that, but this is usually done under the guidance of one of our course ambassadors... Moose are responsible for more animal attacks than bears are." Notes the area is UNESCO World Heritage Site with "237 different mammal and bird species." (https://www.transrockiesgravelroyale.com/stage-stories/rider-safety-with-mack)
