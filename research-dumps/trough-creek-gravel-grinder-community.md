# TROUGH CREEK GRAVEL GRINDER — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Evan McGregor [ELITE]:** "During the taper, I overthought and questioned every decision made leading into race day, every nuance of the course, gear loadout, and so on. When the race started, my mind was clear. I was in the moment. I had a bad tactical decision (though well executed) early in the race that put me on a 15- to 20-second gap on the longest and hardest climb of the day. Me of a year ago would've stressed and gone to the edge to close that gap. This time I let it go. I let a few others pass me, as well. The moment didn't call for anything else."

**Evan McGregor [ELITE]:** "Gradually the gaps closed. I passed riders who had pushed past me. I got others in sight. I kept a measured effort through the trails chasing others down and finally caught up to the Full Course series leader... The trail section there finished with a pretty gnarly and technical descent, and I was able to fly through it to close the gap."

**Evan McGregor [ELITE]:** "My rear tire had lost 15 psi during the race, but I was in control and aware. I learned a lot about what I can do with a clear head and focus in a race when fear and panic don't enter the equation." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/evans-story-trough-creek-gravel-grinder)

**Evan McGregor [ELITE]:** "The Trough Creek Half Series course is around 40 miles and 4000 of elevation over varied terrain: pavement, gravel, snowmobile trail, doubletrack, it's a great mix!" (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/evans-story-trough-creek-gravel-grinder)

**Evan McGregor [ELITE]:** "The finish is hard, and if I went full into the red that early, I wouldn't be able to close things out how I felt I would need to." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/evans-story-trough-creek-gravel-grinder)

**Evan McGregor [ELITE]:** "This race highlighted my progression as a performing athlete over the past year... Leading into the race was the longest taper I've ever done of almost two weeks. Simply put, I've not had a healthy run into a high priority race in over three years, but after my spring injury, it's been pretty smooth sailing."

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**[ELITE] Tire Pressure Management:** Evan McGregor experienced a 15 psi loss in his rear tire during the Half Series (40 miles) but was still able to maintain control and win. This suggests starting pressure needs to account for potential loss over technical terrain. (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/evans-story-trough-creek-gravel-grinder)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Mixed Surface Complexity [ELITE perspective]:** The Half Series (40 miles, ~4000' elevation) includes pavement, gravel, snowmobile trail, and doubletrack. According to Evan McGregor, there's a "pretty gnarly and technical descent" on one of the trail sections. (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/evans-story-trough-creek-gravel-grinder)

**Technical Descent [ELITE perspective]:** The trail sections include at least one "pretty gnarly and technical descent" where descending skills can make up time gaps. (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/evans-story-trough-creek-gravel-grinder)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**[ELITE] Early Race Pacing:** Evan McGregor noted that going hard early on "the longest and hardest climb of the day" can put you in the red and compromise your ability to finish strong. He deliberately let gaps open early, allowing his breathing to settle, then gradually closed them back down. This worked for a race win in the 40-mile distance at 2:20:21. (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/evans-story-trough-creek-gravel-grinder)

**[ELITE] Technical Sections as Opportunities:** McGregor used technical descending skills to close gaps that opened on climbs, suggesting that strong bike handling can be a tactical weapon even if you're not the strongest climber.

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**[ELITE] Mental Approach:** Evan McGregor emphasized staying "in the moment" rather than fixating on season goals during the race itself. When he made an early tactical error that created a gap, he focused on the immediate race dynamics rather than panicking about the overall series implications. (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/evans-story-trough-creek-gravel-grinder)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Family-Friendly Event:** Evan McGregor describes bringing his wife Amanda and children to the race, noting "There aren't many spouses at the races. There are fewer kids present. Amanda is there, showing me what hard work, dedication, grit, and excellence are through the unconditional love she gives our family day after day." He mentions that the staging area has space for "games, arts, and crafts" to keep kids entertained, and he brings his children up on the podium for memories.
