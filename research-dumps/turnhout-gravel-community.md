# TURNHOUT GRAVEL — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Sophie Wright [ELITE]:** "I've done six years on the WorldTour and it's definitely going to be different. In road racing, you're working together as a team. Gravel is individual racing, and that's kind of how I started racing years and years ago, with cyclo-cross and mountain bike. Now, I just feel like I'm ready for a change. I want to try something pretty different, and also go back to my off-road roots." (https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/its-going-to-be-wild-ribble-launches-new-gravel-team-with-ex-worldtour-pros)

**Harry Tanfield [ELITE]:** "I've always loved doing road races with gravel in them, and I thought, 'Well, why not? Why not actually give it a try and see what it's all about?' I've heard that for the Gralloch, you have to line up like one hour before the race – and it starts at a ridiculously early time as it is – and then you go down this really small track, and then everyone's fighting for position for this 20-minute berg or something like that. It's going to be wild." (https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/its-going-to-be-wild-ribble-launches-new-gravel-team-with-ex-worldtour-pros)

**Geerike Schreurs [ELITE]:** "I had several flat tires and had to chase back multiple times. At one point, I rode over 35 kilometers on a flat tyre. But I kept pushing, and in the final 10 kilometers, I attacked on the technical singletrack. I knew positioning can be key, so I went all-in with 500 meters to move and completed it off within the dash."

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

The 72km course features a mix of **"long straight wide open gravel boulevards amidst the meadows and nature reserves and long stretches through forests and along the channel."** (https://ucigravelworldseries.com/en/wurtz-schmidt-and-schreurs-victorious-in-fast-bolero-turnhout-gravel/)

Course characteristics described as **"champagne gravel"** - fine, crunchy gravel reminiscent of American-style gravel roads with **long, fast sections**. The terrain is **flat with only 100m of elevation per lap**. (https://turnhoutgravel.be/en/ and https://ucigravelworldseries.com/en/turnhout/)

**Course update for 2026:** "The course will get an update near Merksplas on the north side of the course with new tracks and better traffic management, but the major update comes in the long 15km stretch along the canal where riders go away from the water twice to avoid potential muddy sections in rainy weather conditions." (https://ucigravelworldseries.com/en/turnhout/)

**Sandy sections pose the primary challenge** as noted in the course preview, with elevation gain being minimal. (https://ucigravelworldseries.com/en/bolero-turnhout-gravel-record-breaking-event-in-the-uci-gravel-world-series/)

The race features **"technical singletrack"** sections where positioning becomes critical in the final 10km. (https://cycling-info.com/mads-wurtz-schmidt-and-geerike-schreurs-triumph-at-thrilling-turnhout-gravel-race-in-belgium/)
