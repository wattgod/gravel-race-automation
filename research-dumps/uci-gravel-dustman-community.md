# UCI GRAVEL DUSTMAN — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Caroline Livesey [ELITE]:** "This is the first time Thailand has been host to a UCI Gravel World Series race, and when the opportunity came up for me to race I couldn't refuse. I'm so glad I came, it's been a special week. This race also reminded me that gravel racing is as much about having experience with kit and equipment as it is about being able to hold power. There were a lot of people with the wrong tyres for the job, but I suppose Dustman was a bit of a misnomer. Slicks in those conditions were a death trap and sadly there were a lot of DNFs."

Livesey also described it as a "mudfest adventure" due to rain conditions. (https://www.cyclingnews.com/races/uci-gravel-world-series-events-2025/dustman/results/)

**Tobias Kongstad [ELITE]:** Wrapped up his "three weekends-three continents tour" with Dustman Thailand as his final stop after competing at Big Sugar Classic in the US on October 18 (26th place) and winning Gribben Gravel in Denmark on October 26.

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**[ELITE] — Tire Selection Critical:** Caroline Livesey specifically noted that "there were a lot of people with the wrong tyres for the job" and that "slicks in those conditions were a death trap" due to muddy, wet conditions. The race conditions made tire choice as important as power output. (https://www.cyclingnews.com/races/uci-gravel-world-series-events-2025/dustman/results/)

## Weather Experienced

**November 1, 2025 Race:** Heavy rain created water-logged and muddy course conditions, transforming the event into what Caroline Livesey called a "mudfest adventure." The race became significantly more technical due to weather. (https://www.cyclingnews.com/races/uci-gravel-world-series-events-2025/dustman/results/)

**Typical Climate:** Kanchanaburi has a tropical savanna climate with dry winters and monsoon season running May through October. April is the hottest month with average daily maximum of 38.2°C (100.8°F). The region stays cooler than other central Thailand provinces due to its location at the edge of a mountain range.

**[ELITE] — Equipment vs. Power:** Caroline Livesey noted that "gravel racing is as much about having experience with kit and equipment as it is about being able to hold power" — suggesting that in muddy conditions, equipment choices were as race-deciding as fitness. (https://www.cyclingnews.com/races/uci-gravel-world-series-events-2025/dustman/results/)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Tire Selection:** According to elite winner Caroline Livesey, wrong tire choice (specifically slicks) was "a death trap" in the muddy 2025 conditions and led to "a lot of DNFs." (https://www.cyclingnews.com/races/uci-gravel-world-series-events-2025/dustman/results/)

**Course Variability:** Organizers note that "routes are in the woods, things can be changed as per weather" and "the route can be slightly altered for some safety reason if any areas are affected by natural causes" — suggesting pre-race reconnaissance may not reflect actual race day conditions.
