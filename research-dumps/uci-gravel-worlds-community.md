# UCI GRAVEL WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Joy A. Franco, PhD [COMPETITIVE]:** "An epic adventure warrants a proper report. Qualifying for and getting to race my age group at UCI Gravel World Championships this year, representing my country as a member of Team USA, was the privilege of a lifetime... This race was unlike anything I've ever done in my 18 years of bike racing experience in all the best ways possible and I'd do it all over again in a heartbeat." (https://neurojoy.net/blog/ucigravelworldsracereport/)

**Joy A. Franco, PhD [COMPETITIVE]:** "When we hit that first real climb in Raar, the first real attack came and shattered things apart. It was the last I would see of the leaders as my legs imploded... Not long after the muscles in my legs started to get torn apart by cramps, which was only halfway through the race." (https://neurojoy.net/blog/ucigravelworldsracereport/)

**Joy A. Franco, PhD [COMPETITIVE]:** "All of the women in the field were excellent bike handlers and never once did things feel sketch. It was, however, hard to maintain position as things became narrower and the semi-technical downhill into the first real climb left little room for more than 2-women wide." (https://neurojoy.net/blog/ucigravelworldsracereport/)

**Paige (Elite rider) [ELITE]:** "I participated in USAC Gravel Nationals last month and as many of you have heard me say, this was the safest gravel event that I have ever done. Granted, my racing history only spans 2 years but it's still worth noting. With that, similar rules for road closures, standards and safety protocols were in place at UCI Gravel Worlds. The course is closed to traffic and I never once felt like I had to worry about oncoming traffic, stop signs or traffic lights interfering with my race." (https://www.paigepowered.com/post/uci-gravel-world-championships-race-recap)

**Paige [ELITE]:** "I was really disappointed in the fact that the UCI did not think through or recognize that the men's age group fields would impact the women's race... From my personal perspective, it did impact my race. After the first few climbs, you entered a longer 30km section of flatter terrain... About 10km into this 30km flatter stretch, a large group of age group males caught up to us hauling. A lot of the women jumped the wheels and suddenly our group became a smash fest of who could hang onto the guy's wheels to get pulled along and it was strung out." (https://www.paigepowered.com/post/uci-gravel-world-championships-race-recap)

**Paige [ELITE]:** "The course was really a highlight of the weekend. This race perfectly paired so many disciplines into one. It was like a road race paired with a mountain bike race as well as some tight loose gravel sectors. And let's not forget the plethora of corners and turns and narrow Italian alleys…err I mean roads…." (https://www.paigepowered.com/post/uci-gravel-world-championships-race-recap)

**Marianne Vos [ELITE]:** "I didn't think about the previous 13 to be honest. Of course, it [gravel] is something fairly new but it's a World Championships so you try to do your best... There was a pretty big group but then on a harder part Lotte set a really high pace and then we were the four of us, with Lorena Wiebes and [Italy's] Soraya Paladin, but then with another hard part we were left with two." (https://www.velouk.net/2024/10/07/report-result-world-gravel-championships/)

**Mathieu van der Poel [ELITE]:** "It's super nice to add another rainbow to the collection, in another discipline. I wanted to make the race as hard as possible because I knew with a big group it could be a difficult situation for me, so I tried to put everybody on the limit. When Florian Vermeersch went, we had good cooperation. It was a super hard race, but I enjoyed it and I'm, of course, super happy with the title." (https://www.velouk.net/2024/10/07/report-result-world-gravel-championships/)

**Steve Thomas (journalist covering 2025 race) [ELITE coverage]:** "Although it was a great bike race, and was contested by the best in the game, it played out pretty much as a spring road classic, only with a few gravel caveats. The terrain was rurally nice, and the kind of stuff that's sweet to ride; fast, mildly hilly, pretty smooth, and on a mix of non-technical road-gravel & farm roads, which is definitely stretching some purists' ideals of gravel racing."

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Joy A. Franco [COMPETITIVE]:** "The first few miles of the race were on city roads as we made our way to the dirt. It felt much like a road race, and I focused on sitting-in, protected from the wind and work." On positioning: "I knew I needed to get over the pain, dig deep, and stay with that train. For the next hour and a half I focused on a single goal: stay with that group. Stay on that wheel." (https://neurojoy.net/blog/ucigravelworldsracereport/)

**Joy A. Franco [COMPETITIVE]:** Finished in 4h 52min. "For about 10 km it was just a solo mental suffer fast, until a group of three riders came fast from behind... After they passed I jumped hard and got on that wheel. For the final 4 km I gritted my teeth and just didn't let go." (https://neurojoy.net/blog/ucigravelworldsracereport/)

**Paige [ELITE]:** "I knew I had to get to the front early to get in a better position. My assignment (in a perfect world) would be to help Lauren in the flatter sections during the middle part of the course but early on I could see we needed to get her to the front. I started to be aggressive to move up... Around 12-13K, there was an important pinch point where this wider road narrowed into a single lane road." (https://www.paigepowered.com/post/uci-gravel-world-championships-race-recap)

**Start positioning strategy (2024 edition):** "Riders in the elite men's and women's races would be given pre-determined start positions. These were based on each rider's UCI ranking on the road, MTB and CX as well as results in Gravel World Series events... Since the course began with a steep short climb on a narrow road, there was little opportunity for any of those who started further down the grid to move up. A rider on the back row would have lost at least 20 seconds to those at the front by the top of the climb." (https://www.rouleur.cc/en-us/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/the-inaugural-uci-gravel-world-championships-were-they-a-success-and-do-we-really-need-them)

## Nutrition Strategy

**Joy A. Franco [COMPETITIVE]:** "We broke down the numbers for how many calories I could actually digest during a race, what that meant in terms of carbs, and how to time the delivery. On my own, I tested what foods worked best during a race over multiple events and came prepared with exactly the race foods I needed to prevent bonking. Side note: The cramping was absolutely due to a lack of high-end fitness (more on that in a moment) and not because of a lack of electrolytes." (https://neurojoy.net/blog/ucigravelworldsracereport/)

**Joy A. Franco [COMPETITIVE]:** On pre-race nutrition issues: "Within thirty minutes of racing I was starving, and that really shouldn't happen... I'm gluten intolerant, which has made getting enough carbohydrates a constant challenge in life... At home, I eat cups of [calrose rice] in the days leading up to the race. I pair it with New England maple syrup and 5% Fage Greek yogurt to achieve the perfect pre-endurance race macro balance. I didn't realize it would be so hard to find gluten free carbohydrates in France and the Netherlands." (https://neurojoy.net/blog/ucigravelworldsracereport/)

**Paige [ELITE]:** "We also both missed a feed (those feeds were CHAOS) and were sharing a bottle" (https://www.paigepowered.com/post/uci-gravel-world-championships-race-recap)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Joy A. Franco [COMPETITIVE]:** "I got sick one month before the race and lost about two weeks of essential training. I had planned to be at Rochester CX racing at high-intensity but was instead trying to regain health at home. For the week and a half leading up to the race I was on honeymoon trying to find time for rides amidst just living up tourist life in Paris. It was far from ideal race prep." (https://neurojoy.net/blog/ucigravelworldsracereport/)

**Joy A. Franco [COMPETITIVE]:** "The race-course passed through the start area twice, giving me two chances to easily drop out and pedal the short ride back to my hotel and bed." She resisted despite severe cramping mid-race. (https://neurojoy.net/blog/ucigravelworldsracereport/)

**Paige [ELITE]:** On crashes: "After this, things started to get really strung out and I was caught behind multiple crashes, and Crystal was as well." (https://www.paigepowered.com/post/uci-gravel-world-championships-race-recap)

**Age-group safety issues:** "Like last year, there were issues throughout with riders catching and trying to shimmy past slower riders, leaving some in hospital with broken bones."

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Joy A. Franco [COMPETITIVE] - 2025 Netherlands course:** "The first few miles of the race were on city roads as we made our way to the dirt. It felt much like a road race... As we hit the double track that weaves between plots of farmland things became more strung out but manageable... the semi-technical downhill into the first real climb left little room for more than 2-women wide." (https://neurojoy.net/blog/ucigravelworldsracereport/)

**Joy A. Franco [COMPETITIVE]:** "Immediately after that climb was a steep dirt downhill with washboard section littered with water bottles from the groups ahead, further stringing things out... The second time we went up that climb in Raar my legs started cramping so badly... We hit that paved climb in Raar for the final time... after the technical downhill, rejoining them before the next climb, which was much steeper and more technical on a rocky double wide trail." (https://neurojoy.net/blog/ucigravelworldsracereport/)

**Paige [ELITE] - 2023 Italy course:** "The course was really a highlight of the weekend. This race perfectly paired so many disciplines into one. It was like a road race paired with a mountain bike race as well as some tight loose gravel sectors. And let's not forget the plethora of corners and turns and narrow Italian alleys... The start was really chaotic as it was a cyclocross type start with some grass sectors and a small loop around a lake with a narrow gravel path." (https://www.paigepowered.com/post/uci-gravel-world-championships-race-recap)

**Paige [ELITE]:** "Around 12-13K, there was an important pinch point where this wider road narrowed into a single lane road and shortly after was gravel 2-track that led into a very rocky dried out creek bed." (https://www.paigepowered.com/post/uci-gravel-world-championships-race-recap)

**Steve Thomas - 2025 Netherlands:** "The region of Limburg is one deeply rooted in cycling, and is home to the Amstel Gold classic road race, which weaves around these narrow and twisted farm roads with great windswept intensity – in one of the most, flat countries' hilliest regions... fast, mildly hilly, pretty smooth, and on a mix of non-technical road-gravel & farm roads." (https://off.road.cc/content/feature/dodgy-tactics-and-dutch-domination-the-2025-uci-gravel-world-championships-analysed)

**2025 Netherlands weather:** "The first of the two official 'big' UCI title races of the weekend was the elite women's race, which took place in dry autumnal weather on Saturday, with just the odd patch of gloop and water along the way – although it was nothing that was going to really impact the way the race was ridden or the eventual results."

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Joy A. Franco [COMPETITIVE]:** "All of the women in the field were excellent bike handlers and never once did things feel sketch." (https://neurojoy.net/blog/ucigravelworldsracereport/)

**Joy A. Franco [COMPETITIVE]:** On USAC team dynamics: "We were given the choice since we paid our own way if we wanted to partake in team tactics vs race for ourselves. All of the women riders opted for the team tactics, and that spoke volume to the group of riders we had with us... All riders were active participants and it felt respectful." (https://neurojoy.net/blog/ucigravelworldsracereport/)

**Paige [ELITE]:** "The atmosphere before and after events was festival-like, it was fun first, racing after. It's not surprising, then, that what the UCI (cycling's world governing body) represents, doesn't quite align with gravel racing's original ethos." (https://www.paigepowered.com/post/uci-gravel-world-championships-race-recap)

**Steve Thomas - 2024 Belgium:** "Milling around the start area of the 2022 Gravel World Championships, it was nothing like the laid-back, friendly atmosphere that is so common at gravel races that have dominated the scene in the past. There were serious-looking policemen blocking crowds from entering the start area where riders were lining up, there were riders on rollers and turbo trainers plugged into headphones... The same could be said for the finish, riders were whisked off by their soigneurs as soon as they crossed the line, the crowds left clamouring for a selfie or autograph, but mostly leaving disappointed." (https://www.rouleur.cc/en-us/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/the-inaugural-uci-gravel-world-championships-were-they-a-success-and-do-we-really-need-them)

**Steve Thomas - 2025 Netherlands:** "The region of Limburg is one deeply rooted in cycling... This is perfect terrain for the Dutch and Belgian riders, who grew up racing on such roads." On crowd support: "It was clear from the huge crowds that lined the start and finishing straights in both the men's and women's events that cycling fans were excited to watch gravel." (https://off.road.cc/content/feature/dodgy-tactics-and-dutch-domination-the-2025-uci-gravel-world-championships-analysed)

## Organizational Issues & Controversy

**Paige [ELITE]:** "I was really disappointed in the fact that the UCI did not think through or recognize that the men's age group fields would impact the women's race. Like USAC Gravel Nationals, I felt the UCI should have had a no draft rule in place for the women's race... From my personal perspective, it did impact my race." (https://www.paigepowered.com/post/uci-gravel-world-championships-race-recap)

**Paige [ELITE] on media coverage:** "Rather than doing an entirely separate blog about this, I think many of you should just go listen to the Girls Gone Gravel Podcast that came out this week where we talk about this specifically. I will be honest in admitting that I never even thought it wouldn't be broadcasted, it was more of who was going to broadcast it. So when the news came out of no coverage, it was really disappointing." (https://www.paigepowered.com/post/uci-gravel-world-championships-race-recap)

**Alison Tetrick [ELITE] on race distance inequality:** "Make the men AND the women the champions of the day. Showcase and create fandom around our hard-working athletes that have the tenacity to risk failure to support and be present. Why wouldn't you make the stage big enough for everyone? This is a regression in sports. This is reverse-engineering of everything we have worked for and built." (https://www.rouleur.cc/en-us/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/the-inaugural-uci-gravel-world-championships-were-they-a-success-and-do-we-really-need-them)

**UCI national kit requirement:** "The UCI stated that all riders from each nation in the elite category had to wear the most recent version of their national kit or they would be subject to a fine or disqualification. With many nations, including Great Britain, opting not to support a team going to race the Gravel World Championships, some riders were forced to purchase their own national kit. One rider in the British men's elite team was racing in a national jersey he'd bought on Facebook Marketplace a few weeks before the event." (https://www.rouleur.cc/en-us/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/the-inaugural-uci-gravel-world-championships-were-they-a-success-and-do-we-really-need-them)

**2025 Dutch team tactics controversy:** "Perhaps even more confusing (and laced with undertones beyond the orange jerseys) was how the huge Dutch team raced in a tactical sense, which was frustrating to watch at times. It pretty much looked like it was a case of every woman for themselves, right up until the final 9km of the race... The solo Dutch leader Shirin van Anrooij was chased down inside the last kilometre by a group spearheaded by her national teammate Yara Kastelijn, seemingly to aid Wiebes' win (though Kastelijn has since apologies to Van Anrooij, saying she regretted her tactics during the race)." (https://off.road.cc/content/feature/dodgy-tactics-and-dutch-domination-the-2025-uci-gravel-world-championships-analysed)

## What Worked Well

**Joy A. Franco [COMPETITIVE] - Goals achieved:** "Even if I didn't place very high in the pack and wasn't among the fastest ladies, I am still happy with how many things went well... Riding with a group — To be successful in gravel racing requires riding with others... Race nutrition — Another major weakness with regards to endurance racing that I had noted last season was my nutrition... Endurance — I am not a natural endurance athlete... For the past ten months I put effort into increasing my average weekly ride time, doing more and more 4 hr rides than any year before." (https://neurojoy.net/blog/ucigravelworldsracereport/)

**Joy A. Franco [COMPETITIVE]:** "I came across the finish line at 4 h 52 min after the start. Twenty-two minutes shy of my stretch goal but with seven minutes to spare on my 'within reach' goal. Thirtieth out of 39 in my age group." (https://neurojoy.net/blog/ucigravelworldsracereport/)
