# UNBOUND GRAVEL 100 — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Sheri Rosenbaum [ELITE]:** "I am not a racer, and it was hard to prepare for the insanity that ensued during the first 15-20 miles. The initial 20 miles were flat and fast. The gravel roads were relatively tame, allowing faster riders to work their way to the front. There were several crashes early on, which isn't shocking for such a large pack of amateur racers. Even at 20 mph, people were flying past me on the right and the left, then cutting across the road. I willed myself to stay upright, praying for the pack to thin out." (https://www.roadbikerider.com/2025-unbound-100/)

**Ayano Makoto [COMPETITIVE]:** "The lead pack of the age group racers is flying by. What worked especially well was using the grassy inside line on corners to maintain speed without braking too much. Since there are a lot of 90° turns, riders not used to gravel tend to slow down a lot. My cyclocross experience helped me pick the right lines here." (https://blog.chapter2bikes.com/day-at-unbound-gravel-100km/)

**Ayano Makoto [COMPETITIVE]:** "In the end, my legs cramped more than 20 times that day, and I cried out in agony every time. I think the strain of the first two hours was too much." (https://blog.chapter2bikes.com/day-at-unbound-gravel-100km/)

**Marley Blonsky [COMPETITIVE]:** "Thanks to a combination of nerves, way too much caffeine, and starting out too fast, my heart rate was at 180 and I was struggling by mile 8. I've been riding with the Wahoo Tickr heart rate monitor since October and I've found it's a really good way to keep an eye on my efforts and exertion level." (https://marleyblonsky.com/blog-native/unboundgravelrecap)

**Kris Cordova [COMPETITIVE]:** "The adverse conditions at Unbound Gravel this year were exactly what I needed... I can honestly say that I was enjoying myself. Adventure! Orissa and I had gotten separated a few times during the mud walk and by the time I reached the end of it, I couldn't see her anywhere." (https://kriscordova.blogspot.com/2023/06/unbound-gravel-100-race-report-2023.html)

**Kris Cordova [COMPETITIVE]:** "Around mile 70, I started counting down miles. I didn't feel happy not being able to drink freely from my pack whenever I wanted. I had a headache and started to feel lightheaded, then nauseated, as the heat of the day rose and the miles went by slowly. I was probably dehydrated, and there was nothing I could do." (https://kriscordova.blogspot.com/2023/06/unbound-gravel-100-race-report-2023.html)

**Tiffany Cromwell [ELITE]:** "The goal was to win, and I got the win. I was pretty sure I was in the lead. I felt strong... It was a bit scary and hectic early on, a lot of crashes. Obviously, after breaking my collarbone two months back, I was trying to avoid that [crashes]." (https://www.cyclingnews.com/races/unbound-gravel-2025/unbound-100-elite-women-and-men/results/)

**Isaac Allred [ELITE]:** "He and I linked up, and we're like, 'let's go, let's roll this'. So we just rolled it the entire day. Just steady pace the whole time, and just held onto the gap... He led it out and I went around him. I went too early. He was able to hang on my wheel and get around me again." (https://www.cyclingnews.com/races/unbound-gravel-2025/unbound-100-elite-women-and-men/results/)

**Anonymous rider [UNKNOWN]:** "Does anyone know anything about derailleurs?" someone shouted into the throng at one point. While a sure number of races were not salvageable that day, some could have been with a little more patience and know-how." (https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/6-things-learned-first-gravel-130752698.html)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Tire Choices (Rider Level Specific):**

**Ayano Makoto [COMPETITIVE]:** Used DT Swiss GRC 1100 DICUT wheels paired with Maxxis REAVER 45C tires. "The REAVER's diamond knurling reduces rolling resistance and enhances grip in dusty or loose conditions, making it ideal for gravel racing." Set to 28 psi. (https://blog.chapter2bikes.com/day-at-unbound-gravel-100km/)

**Sheri Rosenbaum [ELITE]:** "I'm running Panaracer Gravelking X1 45s, with PSI calculated using the Silca tire pressure calculator." Selected Salsa Cutthroat "for its clearance in case of the notoriously muddy sections." (https://www.roadbikerider.com/preparing-for-unbound/)

**Anonymous [ELITE]:** "I chose the DT Swiss GRC1100 DICUT wheels paired with Maxxis REAVER 45C tires featuring a low-profile tread design... I went with 42mm Specialized Pathfinder Pro tires, set to 28 psi." (https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/6-things-learned-first-gravel-130752698.html)

**Essential Gear (Multi-level consensus):**

**Sheri Rosenbaum [ELITE]:** "Paint stick and a Muc-Off Claw Brush were must-have items in my gear bag. The brushes help clean mud from the chain and cassette." Also recommended Restrap's Hike a Bike Harness for unrideable sections. (https://www.roadbikerider.com/2025-unbound-100/)

**Sheri Rosenbaum [ELITE]:** Essential tools include "Super Glue for any tire sidewall splits or punctures that won't seal... Muc-Off tool with plugs and their hand pump." (https://www.roadbikerider.com/preparing-for-unbound/)

**Anonymous [ELITE]:** Equipment checklist includes "A flat kit with two spare tubes (yes, two), levers and patches... A tire boot (for patching a tire sidewall)... Tire plug kit if you're running a tubeless tire setup... A spare rear derailleur hanger... A multi-tool with a chainbreaker... A paint stick, for scraping mud or debris off your bike." (https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/6-things-learned-first-gravel-130752698.html)

**Ayano Makoto [COMPETITIVE]:** "I attached the Stan's NoTubes DART Tool, a quick-fix puncture repair device, in a spot where I could easily reach it during the race. I simplified the repair kit I brought as much as possible." (https://blog.chapter2bikes.com/day-at-unbound-gravel-100km/)

**Hydration Packs:**

**Sheri Rosenbaum [ELITE]:** Testing between "USWE Rush 8 or High Above Supernatural. The USWE pack is used by 70% of people in the Unbound Facebook group, its unique 'no dancing monkey' design prevents it from moving around on your back... The High Above pack also doesn't move around, but it has many more pockets." (https://www.roadbikerider.com/preparing-for-unbound/)

**Clothing:**

**Sheri Rosenbaum [ELITE]:** "The bibs need a drop bottom for quick bathroom breaks and a very comfortable chamois. The front runners are Peppermint Cycling Signature bibs. The jersey must provide ample sun protection (especially the back of the neck)." Used Trek RSL MTB shoes. "In addition, as a contact wearer, I need a large wrap-around shield to protect my eyes from dusty roads." (https://www.roadbikerider.com/preparing-for-unbound/)

## Weather Experienced

**2025 Race Conditions:**

**Sheri Rosenbaum [ELITE]:** "Next on the list: add Emporia to my weather app. The forecast? Rain. Rain. And more rain! But hey, at least race day was looking dry. Hot but dry... One week from race day... I'd find myself refreshing the app frequently, hoping it would magically stop the rain. Sadly, it doesn't. I'm even receiving flood alerts." Race day was approximately 90 degrees. (https://www.roadbikerider.com/2025-unbound-100/)

**Tiffany Cromwell [ELITE]:** 2025 race had water crossings before Council Grove aid station. (https://www.cyclingnews.com/races/unbound-gravel-2025/unbound-100-elite-women-and-men/results/)

**2023 Race Conditions:**

**Kris Cordova [COMPETITIVE]:** "It had been raining for a week or so every day in Kansas. At the start of the 350XL race on Friday afternoon, the sky opened and the rain poured down for several hours, causing some of the county roads to turn into sticky, thick, 'peanut butter' mud." (https://kriscordova.blogspot.com/2023/06/unbound-gravel-100-race-report-2023.html)

**Kris Cordova [COMPETITIVE]:** "It was also getting really warm outside and I drank every drop of the liquid in my backpack before I arrived in Madison, KS." Max temperature reached 65°F with hours-long storm. (https://kriscordova.blogspot.com/2023/06/unbound-gravel-100-race-report-2023.html)

**2021 Race Conditions:**

**Marley Blonsky [COMPETITIVE]:** "The temps were already in the high 80s" at 10:30 am start. (https://marleyblonsky.com/blog-native/unboundgravelrecap)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Opening Section:**

**Sheri Rosenbaum [ELITE]:** "The initial 20 miles were flat and fast. The gravel roads were relatively tame, allowing faster riders to work their way to the front... I averaged over 17 mph for the first 20 miles." (https://www.roadbikerider.com/2025-unbound-100/)

**Ayano Makoto [COMPETITIVE]:** "The front group set a brisk pace, averaging 37 km/h during the first hour. It felt like a road race, with everyone riding in tight formation." (https://blog.chapter2bikes.com/day-at-unbound-gravel-100km/)

**Mud Sections:**

**Kris Cordova [COMPETITIVE]:** "Then, we turned onto what I now know is called the infamous Road D. The conditions of the road changed abruptly to wet, sticky, suck-your-shoes-off mud... after about a mile of walking like this, we were stopping like everyone else to use paint stirrers to scrape the mud out from between the front wheel and the fork... when I finally did get back on my bike... an hour and 35 minutes had gone by and 13.1 miles of the race were complete. I joked out loud to nobody in particular that I'd gotten a great new half-marathon PR today." (https://kriscordova.blogspot.com/2023/06/unbound-gravel-100-race-report-2023.html)

**Anonymous [ELITE]:** "The mud at Unbound was not the cute little dirty-your-socks and spray-your-face mud, but miles-long stretches of Emporia, Kansas' infamous peanut butter mud that sticks to your tires and, quite literally, stops you in your tracks. Riders trudged along by foot on the grassy roadsides... for upwards of an hour and a half until pedaling was a safe option again." (https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/6-things-learned-first-gravel-130752698.html)

**Course Features:**

**Ayano Makoto [COMPETITIVE]:** "Since there are a lot of 90° turns, riders not used to gravel tend to slow down a lot." On descents: "I dropped my seatpost and tucked in for an aero advantage, passing riders smoothly and conserving energy." (https://blog.chapter2bikes.com/day-at-unbound-gravel-100km/)

**Marley Blonsky [COMPETITIVE]:** "After a quick snack, wetting down of all my gear to try and stay cool, and live update for Pearl Izumi, I was back on my bike. At this point I also met up with the filmmaker again, who would ride along side me getting footage for the next 15 miles or so. From here, the ride got a bit more challenging physically, as we started entering the rolling hills of the Flint Hills." (https://marleyblonsky.com/blog-native/unboundgravelrecap)

**Final Section:**

**Sheri Rosenbaum [ELITE]:** "The two distances then share the final 36 miles back into Emporia, where the final 1.5 miles includes the punch Highland Hill climb and fast finish on Commercial Street." (https://www.roadbikerider.com/preparing-for-unbound/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Start Strategy (Level-Specific):**

**Ayano Makoto [COMPETITIVE]:** "I lined up near the front row in the 6-hour finish target group. At 7:30 a.m., around 1,500 riders took off together. The front group set a brisk pace, averaging 37 km/h during the first hour... I focused on staying in the draft and moving up through the pack without burning too many matches. Instead of just hammering it, I used smart line choices to maintain speed through corners and avoid braking." Achieved sub-6-hour finish. (https://blog.chapter2bikes.com/day-at-unbound-gravel-100km/)

**Sheri Rosenbaum [ELITE]:** "At 7:30 am, the horn went off, and the floodgates opened as 1,700 riders set out on a 108.5 mile adventure... It was easy to get caught up in the excitement and go out too hard. I averaged over 17 mph for the first 20 miles. I left the Garmin screen set to maps and didn't switch to view distance, speed, or grade." (https://www.roadbikerider.com/2025-unbound-100/)

**Marley Blonsky [COMPETITIVE]:** "At 10:30, we started, led by a neutral support vehicle for the first 2 miles. This meant that I was in the very front of the pack with the strongest riders, going nearly 18mph for the start of the ride. While exhilarating, this pace was way too fast for me and totally unsustainable, so as soon as we left town and hit the gravel, I was able to slow down and start riding at my own pace." (https://marleyblonsky.com/blog-native/unboundgravelrecap)

**Nutrition Strategy (Level-Specific):**

**Jonny Tye [UNKNOWN]:** Consumed ~127g carbs per hour (exceeding 90g/h+ guidelines by almost 40%), ~908ml fluid per hour, ~1,037mg sodium per litre. Used "decoupled approach" with PF 300 Flow Gel in Top Tube Flask plus four equally spaced PF 30 Caffeine Gels. "This helped him 'drip-feed' his fuel regularly... one of the most optimal dosing patterns for maintaining intragastric pressure and limiting gut discomfort." Finished in 5hrs 56mins with energy rating 10/10. (https://www.precisionhydration.com/athletes/case-studies/cycling/jonny-tye/31-05-2025/)

**Sheri Rosenbaum [ELITE]:** "I calculated consuming Tailwind's new High Carb Fuel Mix to achieve 90 grams of carbs/hour. Bite-sized dried figs and coconut slices made up the remaining carbs/calories. I also had Cliff Blocks with caffeine that I began taking 20 minutes before the race started. By adding SaltSick Fast Chews and tablets to the plan, I hoped to keep up with my electrolyte intake. Unfortunately, this was not the case." (https://www.roadbikerider.com/2025-unbound-100/)

**Sheri Rosenbaum [ELITE]:** "It's difficult to eat when riding chunky gravel, I'll need to consume most of my calories and carbs using a hydration pack... I've been training my gut to determine what works best for fueling my body and won't cause GI issues." (https://www.roadbikerider.com/preparing-for-unbound/)

**Ayano Makoto [COMPETITIVE]:** "Endurance rides require a lot of carbs to keep a body fueled and avoid bonking. Consuming 75-90 grams of carbs per hour is not something my body is used to processing." (https://blog.chapter2bikes.com/day-at-unbound-gravel-100km/)

**Pacing Adjustments:**

**Ayano Makoto [COMPETITIVE]:** "At the 40km mark, my legs were already starting to cramp. The group was accelerating, and I decided that if I continued to follow them, I would destroy myself, so I decided to leave the leading group after about two hours. My average speed for the first hour was a staggering 37km/h! When I compared it later, I found that it was an average of 2km/h faster than the 200-mile class." (https://blog.chapter2bikes.com/day-at-unbound-gravel-100km/)

**Kris Cordova [COMPETITIVE]:** "Around mile 70, I started counting down miles... I also decided I needed to make it to the finish line as fast as possible, conserving my water as I went. I looked at the time of day and laughed out loud. How could I have cursed us by mocking Orissa for projecting a time of 10 hours? I'd be lucky to make it in that amount of time. At that moment, a sub-10 hour day became the only thing I wanted in life." (https://kriscordova.blogspot.com/2023/06/unbound-gravel-100-race-report-2023.html)

**Elite Race Dynamics:**

**Tiffany Cromwell [ELITE]:** Won in 4:59:13. At Council Grove (midway): "once through Council Grove and on the back half of the course, Cromwell carved out a 2:36 solo lead to the trio of US riders in pursuit." By Kahola Lake dam: "almost 12 minutes ahead." (https://www.cyclingnews.com/races/unbound-gravel-2025/unbound-100-elite-women-and-men/results/)

**Hayden Christian & Isaac Allred [ELITE]:** Won in 4:40:12 (sprint finish). "At the midway point of the race, which took place at the Council Grove aid station, Allred and Christian had moved away with a three-minute margin on a large pack of 26 riders." Built to "almost five minutes" by 27.5 miles to go. (https://www.cyclingnews.com/races/unbound-gravel-2025/unbound-100-elite-women-and-men/results/)

## DNF Risk Factors

**DNF Statistics:**

**Anonymous [UNKNOWN]:** "According to Athlinks data for Unbound Gravel 2023, at least 21% of participants are listed as not having completed their full course, including 28% of the pro field and a whopping 44% of non-elite 200-mile participants. My field fared slightly better with 15% not crossing the finish line." (https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/6-things-learned-first-gravel-130752698.html)

**Mechanical Failures:**

**Anonymous [UNKNOWN]:** "Judging by the hearty number of people I saw sidelined, fixing flats and cursing the mysteries of derailleurs, I'd gander that mechanical issues ruined many a day." (https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/6-things-learned-first-gravel-130752698.html)

**Kris Cordova [COMPETITIVE]:** "Others succumbed to flats by walking the rocks to avoid the mud and the roadside lines, and still others—out of bravery or impatience—tried to ride the mud, only to clog their drivetrains with their efforts. With much less than a quarter of the course tackled, I watched a pickup truck full of riders be carted off the course with muddied, defunct steeds and unfulfilled hopes." (https://kriscordova.blogspot.com/2023/06/unbound-gravel-100-race-report-2023.html)

**Hydration/Nutrition Failures:**

**Kris Cordova [COMPETITIVE]:** "Around mile 70, I started counting down miles. I didn't feel happy not being able to drink freely from my pack whenever I wanted. I had a headache and started to feel lightheaded, then nauseated... I was probably dehydrated, and there was nothing I could do... I recalled how Trent finished Rule of Three in four hours with only 2 bottles, and decided that if he could do it, so could I." Had to manage with only 40 ounces for final 40 miles. (https://kriscordova.blogspot.com/2023/06/unbound-gravel-100-race-report-2023.html)

**Marley Blonsky [COMPETITIVE]:** First flat at mile 10: "My plan was to turn on my headphones (one ear bud only), eat a quick snack, and get back on the road. Well, the universe had other plans for me, as the first flat tire of the day found its way to me... By this time, I was feeling fully rested and ready to ride, but had also stopped for nearly 20 minutes." (https://marleyblonsky.com/blog-native/unboundgravelrecap)

**Early Crashes:**

**Sheri Rosenbaum [ELITE]:** "There were several crashes early on, which isn't shocking for such a large pack of amateur racers." (https://www.roadbikerider.com/2025-unbound-100/)

**Tiffany Cromwell [ELITE]:** "It was a bit scary and hectic early on, a lot of crashes. Obviously, after breaking my collarbone two months back, I was trying to avoid that [crashes]. And then another crash at the water crossing." (https://www.cyclingnews.com/races/unbound-gravel-2025/unbound-100-elite-women-and-men/results/)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Pre-Race Activities:**

**Marley Blonsky [COMPETITIVE]:** "Hanging in front casually drinking coffee next to some very fancy bikes were a bunch of very fit (and cool) looking cyclists and an equal number of photographers... I was recognized almost immediately and any nerves I had melted away, as we all introduced ourselves and folks told me how stoked they were for the inclusion efforts we were doing!" (https://marleyblonsky.com/blog-native/unboundgravelrecap)

**Sheri Rosenbaum [ELITE]:** "I swung by the Girls Gone Gravel booth to see Kathryn Taylor. She had arranged for Ali Tetrick, winner of 2017 Unbound, to pace the women's group for the 100 miler... It was wonderful to see so many women lining up to race. Women of all ages and riding abilities. Some had never ridden a century. Some had little experience with gravel. But in true gravel vibe, everyone was supportive and excited to be riding." (https://www.roadbikerider.com/2025-unbound-100/)

**Inclusivity:**

**Marley Blonsky [COMPETITIVE]:** "Crystal led the ride for the first 8 miles while I was sweeper, staying in the back of the pack to make sure everyone stayed with the group... Midway through, we swapped and I had the opportunity to move to the front and lead the group for the rest of the ride. This felt surreal, as I've never gotten to ride with elite athletes and feel included - but that's exactly what happened." 80-ish people showed up for Shimano All Bodies on Bikes Pre-Ride, including TIBCO Race team and two people who had never done a group ride before. (https://marleyblonsky.com/blog-native/unboundgravelrecap)

**Community Support on Course:**

**Kris Cordova [COMPETITIVE]:** "Many people were joking and laughing through the mud. One guy was even handing out sips of whiskey from a flask. Others seemed defeated and devastated by it. I was grateful to be one of the ones who was making the best of it. I can honestly say that I was enjoying myself. Adventure!" (https://kriscordova.blogspot.com/2023/06/unbound-gravel-100-race-report-2023.html)

**Kris Cordova [COMPETITIVE]:** "As I'm getting ready to get back on my bike, I see a young teenager walking towards me, looking upset. As a serious empath, I can immediately sense something is wrong and sure enough, he has a flat back tire with no means to fix it. He was on the route with his uncle, who had gotten ahead of him with all the repair supplies... We patched up his tire and got him back on the road." (https://kriscordova.blogspot.com/2023/06/unbound-gravel-100-race-report-2023.html)

**Aid Stations:**

**Marley Blonsky [COMPETITIVE]:** "The first rest stop was at mile 15, in a tiny little town called Americus. It felt like an oasis in the desert. Cold drinks, pickles, snacks, cold water. I could've stayed there all day." (https://marleyblonsky.com/blog-native/unboundgravelrecap)

**Kris Cordova [COMPETITIVE]:** "When I arrived at the Water Oasis, there were two RVs at the top of a hill, a bunch of bikes laying on the sides of the road, and a huge line with people waiting to fill their water. Apparently the official aid station had run out of water earlier, and a couple of people with their RVs were filling up cyclists' bottles with their own water supply." (https://kriscordova.blogspot.com/2023/06/unbound-gravel-100-race-report-2023.html)

**Event Scale:**

**Sheri Rosenbaum [ELITE]:** "At 7:30 am, the horn went off, and the floodgates opened as 1,700 riders set out on a 108.5 mile adventure." (https://www.roadbikerider.com/2025-unbound-100/)

**Marley Blonsky [COMPETITIVE]:** "Unbound Gravel is the world's largest gravel race and event, taking place in tiny Emporia, Kansas and drawing over 4,000 cyclists from across the globe." (https://marleyblonsky.com/blog-native/unboundgravelrecap)

**Emotional Start:**

**Sheri Rosenbaum [ELITE]:** "At 7:25 am, a woman's beautiful voice sang the national anthem. The words have greater meaning in light of the current political climate. I found it very emotional and choked back tears." (https://www.roadbikerider.com/2025-unbound-100/)

**Tire Pressure Culture:**

**Anonymous [ELITE]:** "Me? 42 Pathfinders... Seriously, he's running 38s? Crazy... I'd do 40 RSs over 45s. Better for clearing the mud out there... 28psi? I'd at least do 30... Too high. 22... You may find—as I did within 30 minutes of stepping foot in Emporia, Kansas—that introducing yourself by name is completely superfluous and borderline uncool on race weekend. Identify yourself by your tire choice and tire pressure, and you'll give the air of a seasoned rider. After all, if you're not talking about your tires are you even riding gravel?" (https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/6-things-learned-first-gravel-130752698.html)
