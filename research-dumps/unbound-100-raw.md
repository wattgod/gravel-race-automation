## Event Overview

Unbound Gravel (formerly known as Dirty Kanza) is the world's premier gravel cycling event, held annually in Emporia, Kansas. The event comprises gravel racing covering various distances (25, 50, 100, 200, and 350 miles) held during late spring on rural roads in the Flint Hills region of the Great Plains.

The **Unbound Gravel 100** is a 100-mile (160 km) race that was introduced in 2013. Added to the lineup as a launchpad to the 200-mile main stage event, the 100 quickly became a race in and of itself. It is perfect for those looking for a long day in the saddle, with all the challenges of Flint Hills gravel goodness, and just a bit less pain than the 200-mile event.

### Event History
- The event began with 34 participants in 2006 as "Dirty Kanza"
- Rebranded to "Unbound Gravel" in 2021
- The 100-mile distance was added in 2013
- Now the "World's Premier Gravel Event" with thousands of participants
