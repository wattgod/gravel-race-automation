# UNBOUND 200 — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Amy Charity [ELITE]:** "I definitely trained for the race (the first year) but there were a few things that were really surprising. And one was how quickly it started. It felt like a criterium. I remember looking down, I was 30 miles into the race and I felt like I was near the end of a criterium - my face was red, I was breathing hard - my heart rate must have been in the 180s. And I looked down and it was still 170 miles to go. I was like, 'I better reel it in', but that was what it took to be in that lead group where some of the top women were." (https://www.cyclingnews.com/features/10-things-to-know-before-racing-unbound-gravel/)

**Brian McCulloch [COMPETITIVE]:** "As late as Friday evening the weather forecast was calling for clear conditions. The talk of the town was that the temperature would be ideal and would likely have a tail wind for the final quarter of the race… Well, the tailwind portion was spot-on! On the line, as we awaited the dawning sun and starters gun, the clouds began to gather... A short two hours later we would be riding through some of the worst rain I have ever pedaled through." (https://ircbike.com/blogs/news/unbound-gravel-race-report)

**Caroline Worrall [RECREATIONAL]:** "Around mile 42, I was coming down a descent, trying to stay slower, but still moving faster than I should have been. As I bounced across the bottom, I suddenly found my wheels spinning and realized that I had dropped my chain. I pulled over to the side and climbed off my bike... I nestled the chain onto the small chainring, spun the pedals, then went running through the gears… nothing. My rear derailleur made a slight humming noise like it was trying to move, but it did not. The chain was stuck on the 11 cog." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/2021-unbound-gravel-200-by-gravel-newbie-not-any-more-caroline-worrall/)

**Mettle Cycling writer [ELITE]:** "Carbon wheels are getting pulverized by rocks popping out from under MTB tires, nervous riders are overlapping wheels creating that knob against knob zipper sound that usually leads to the slap of carbon frames and helmets hitting the deck. My only concern is getting through the next 2 hours without a spell of bad luck or poor line choice... I hear crashes over my shoulder. The tension continues to escalate." (https://www.mettlecycling.com/post/unbound-200-2025-mettle-race-report)

**Isaiah Newkirk [COMPETITIVE]:** "I went into the race knowing the course wasn't necessarily ideal for me due to the considerable elevation gain, but I felt pumped nonetheless. I opted to race the Extra Grit route that boasted over 120 miles and 10,000 feet of climbing... After 15 minutes of chasing through the steep rollers at the beginning of the climb, I finally caught the race leader. After lobbing a few blows at one another, I punched it hard out of a hairpin where I had taken a better line. The gap quickly opened and I realized I was finally solo off the front of the race." (https://obedbikes.com/blogs/stories/10-tips-to-finish-the-unbound-gravel-200-or-any-long-gravel-race)

**SomeMayoPlease [ELITE]:** "I finished the 200 in 10 hours and 13 minutes, which was good enough for the Age Group win and third overall... From the moment I was on my own, for roughly six hours, I averaged 246 watts and my normalized was 255, showing how important it is to not surge on climbs and use momentum when climbing. I generally rode the same power uphill as downhill and that allowed me to stay strong all day long." (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/1d8dvkf/unbound_200_my_experience_pacing_strategy_tips/)

**Bertn05 [ELITE]:** "Started at the first line aiming for 10 hours, I was immediately out in the front, planning to stay clear from most of the danger. When we hit Kaw road this proved to be the right strategy but I should have been even further ahead because around me they started to crash. 3 times I avoided these but had to put in some efforts to gain position again... Time: 10h37 whereas ridetime was 10h32, 252 NP (74kg) 9440 Kcal" (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/1d8txts/unbound_200_after_all_your_tips_the_result/)

**minidini10 [RECREATIONAL]:** "I made it to Lake Kahola and the residents were having a blast. There were so many people on course cheering on riders, it was great. I even got a beer handup right before sunset from a farmer. I rolled through the finish at 9:30pm... I'm really happy with my day. It actually went by kind of fast. I didn't beat the sun, but my legs performed as well as I was hoping." Time: 15 hours/13.5mph, 178 watts normalized power. (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/1d85e8h/unbound_200_mile_race_recap_2024/)

**Brennan Wertz [COMPETITIVE]:** "When I trained for the UNBOUND 200 last year, I only did one ride longer than 100 miles (it was 120 miles). I only did around 5 'long rides' in training and most were actually in the 60-90 mile range. Again, keeping these rides shorter let me recover faster so I could keep consistent by riding throughout the week without needing to take multiple days off." (https://abovecategory.com/blogs/journal/preparing-for-the-unbound-200)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Tires - ELITE Level:**
- **SomeMayoPlease [ELITE]:** Continental Race Kings 2.2 (56mm) with Orange Seal Pro, ran tubeless for 10:13 finish (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/1d8dvkf/unbound_200_my_experience_pacing_strategy_tips/)
- **Mettle Cycling [ELITE]:** "Conti Race King 2" in front and Schwalbe G-One RS Pro 50mm in the rear with a Tannus Armor Liner... The plan for pressure was 17.5 / 19.5 but as the day got warmer, the pressure also increased to something closer to 19.5 / 21. The only drawback was the slick rear when hitting greasy sections." (https://www.mettlecycling.com/post/unbound-200-2025-mettle-race-report)
- **Bertn05 [ELITE]:** Gravelking SS 43mm tubeless, no inserts, on Reserve 40/44 wheelset for 10:37 finish (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/1d8txts/unbound_200_after_all_your_tips_the_result/)

**Tires - RECREATIONAL Level:**
- **minidini10 [RECREATIONAL]:** Panaracer Gravelking SK 43mm with inserts, 33psi front 35psi rear with 4oz Orange Seal. "I got a rear puncture at some point because sealant was all over my taillight. I never heard the puncture or lost any pressure." (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/1d85e8h/unbound_200_mile_race_recap_2024/)

**Gearing:**
- **Bertn05 [ELITE]:** Rival Groupset 43/33x10-34 but noted "might do 46 in the future but more likely a 1by setup" (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/1d8txts/unbound_200_after_all_your_tips_the_result/)
- **Mettle Cycling [ELITE]:** SRAM XX1, Garbaruk 48t chainring with 10-50 XX1 Cassette (https://www.mettlecycling.com/post/unbound-200-2025-mettle-race-report)

**Chain Maintenance:**
- **Mettle Cycling [ELITE]:** "Another enormous choice was using Silca chain wax. I've been on the wax train for a few years now and I'll never go back. The mud was just enough to spray a film over the drivetrain but a quick power wash fixed that issue and there was no need to re-lube. Just wipe and go." (https://www.mettlecycling.com/post/unbound-200-2025-mettle-race-report)

**Hydration Systems:**
- **Amy Charity [ELITE]:** "I did wear a Camelback and I think that was a good call, to have a straw right in front of you that you can get to and remind yourself to drink." (https://www.cyclingnews.com/features/10-things-to-know-before-racing-unbound-gravel/)
- **minidini10 [RECREATIONAL]:** "I was happy to have a hydration pack for the packed groups and during technical sections... One 2L hydration pack with 150 grams of carbs and 2800mg sodium" (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/1d85e8h/unbound_200_mile_race_recap_2024/)

**Aero Bars:**
- **SomeMayoPlease [ELITE]:** "Using the aero bars to my advantage, I was driving up the pace" and used "Vision aero bars with blip shifters" (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/1d8dvkf/unbound_200_my_experience_pacing_strategy_tips/)

**Suspension:**
- **SomeMayoPlease [ELITE]:** Lauf Seigla with suspension fork for 10:13 finish (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/1d8dvkf/unbound_200_my_experience_pacing_strategy_tips/)

## Weather Experienced

**2022 Edition:**
**Brian McCulloch [COMPETITIVE]:** "As late as Friday evening the weather forecast was calling for clear conditions... A short two hours later we would be riding through some of the worst rain I have ever pedaled through, and I love the harsh elements!... Then my mindset changed from frustration to, 'let's get it on!' From there things dried out." Also experienced "torrential rain for two days" before the event that "forced a last-minute course change and re-route." (https://ircbike.com/blogs/news/unbound-gravel-race-report)

**2024 Edition:**
**minidini10 [RECREATIONAL]:** "It was a cool 65 degrees" at 6:30am start. "The sun had come out by now and really started to exhaust people. I made it Alta Vista for the Water Oasis... By this point it was the afternoon, sunny and mid 80s Fahrenheit. I was used to this but many didn't have the same training conditions." (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/1d85e8h/unbound_200_mile_race_recap_2024/)

**General:**
**Amy Charity [ELITE]:** "You almost can't even keep track of everything that hurts. Hotfoot is really common - it's things that maybe didn't come up in your training because you might have only done six hours or eight hours and all sudden you're on hour nine" (https://www.cyclingnews.com/features/10-things-to-know-before-racing-unbound-gravel/)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**E Kaw Reserve Road (Mile 27-28):**
- **minidini10 [RECREATIONAL]:** "Kaw Reserve was rough and rocky, but not too bad. Still, there were bottles everywhere and people pulled over to fix their bikes." (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/1d85e8h/unbound_200_mile_race_recap_2024/)
- **Bertn05 [ELITE]:** "When we hit Kaw road this proved to be the right strategy but I should have been even further ahead because around me they started to crash. 3 times I avoided these" (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/1d8txts/unbound_200_after_all_your_tips_the_result/)

**Divide Road (after Eskridge, ~Mile 40):**
- **minidini10 [RECREATIONAL]:** "Immediately leaving Eskridge, Divide Rd started. This was the roughest section of the day. Steep, rocky, pointy, and it went for a handful of miles. This was one of the few times a front suspension and wider tires would have really helped." (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/1d85e8h/unbound_200_mile_race_recap_2024/)
- **Brian McCulloch [COMPETITIVE]:** Mentioned seeing riders ejected from group on Divide Road (https://ircbike.com/blogs/news/unbound-gravel-race-report)

**Little Egypt:**
- **minidini10 [RECREATIONAL]:** "After Volland was Little Egypt. This was rockier than Divide but only half the distance." (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/1d85e8h/unbound_200_mile_race_recap_2024/)
- **Bertn05 [ELITE]:** "We are getting close to the hills of Little Egypt, we catch more and more riders and drop them almost instantly" (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/1d8txts/unbound_200_after_all_your_tips_the_result/)

**Alma Descent:**
- **minidini10 [RECREATIONAL]:** "Coming into Alma, there was a steep twisty downhill. Some poor guy slid out and tumbled into a barbed-wire fence. Emergency vehicles were able to get to him quickly." (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/1d85e8h/unbound_200_mile_race_recap_2024/)

**Volland Train Crossing:**
- **minidini10 [RECREATIONAL]:** "At Volland, I got stopped by a train that cost seven minutes." (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/1d85e8h/unbound_200_mile_race_recap_2024/)

**General Course Character:**
**Mettle Cycling [ELITE]:** "The combination of speed, durability, and preparation cause the biggest internal debate... Freshly laid gravel in this area means pretty giant stones... In others, where Jeep drivers decided to tear it up while still wet, the giant ruts left over created literal gutters and curbs that ended a lot of riders' days." (https://www.mettlecycling.com/post/unbound-200-2025-mettle-race-report)

**Brian McCulloch [COMPETITIVE]:** "We were ice-skating on bikes... with a 2.5-mile mud sector where we blended back on-course with the 100-mile riders. All of them were walking... I was third wheel, then almost immediately the lead rider in our group slipped and 'SPLAT' his way into the mud with a suction-cup like sound." (https://ircbike.com/blogs/news/unbound-gravel-race-report)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Start Strategy - ELITE:**
**SomeMayoPlease [ELITE]:** "My goal was to position myself well and avoid surging after corners, picking my own lines, and bombing it on every downhill. Mentally, I had marked Mile 28 as the first important point on the course, and I surged to make sure I led the entire pack. This extremely rough double track was much easier to take being on the front, and I applied a lot of pressure right away. Coming out of this section, I assume the entire pack of 1,100 riders was down to fewer than 50." (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/1d8dvkf/unbound_200_my_experience_pacing_strategy_tips/)

**Start Strategy - COMPETITIVE/RECREATIONAL:**
**Brennan Wertz [COMPETITIVE]:** "The 'right' group is one where you can maintain your all-day pace while staying sheltered behind other riders... The biggest mistake almost EVERY racer makes, even pros, is going out too hard. If your main goal is to finish and finish strong, then conservative pacing is key." (https://abovecategory.com/blogs/journal/preparing-for-the-unbound-200)

**aydraper [RECREATIONAL - from TrainerRoad forum]:** "I definitely messed this up in 2019. Went too hard the first 56 miles and slowed every 50 miles after. I'm planning on going out much more slowly this year. It's hard to do in the group. So I'm thinking about starting with the 16 hour group so I ride pretty chill the first 1/4." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/unbound-gravel-race-recap/53441?page=9)

**Power Pacing - ELITE:**
**SomeMayoPlease [ELITE]:** 246W average, 255W normalized over 6 hours solo, 10:13 finish at 74kg bodyweight. "Showing how important it is to not surge on climbs and use momentum when climbing. I generally rode the same power uphill as downhill and that allowed me to stay strong all day long." (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/1d8dvkf/unbound_200_my_experience_pacing_strategy_tips/)

**Bertn05 [ELITE]:** 252W normalized power for 10:37 finish at 74kg, 9440 Kcal burned (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/1d8txts/unbound_200_after_all_your_tips_the_result/)

**Power Pacing - RECREATIONAL:**
**minidini10 [RECREATIONAL]:** 178W normalized for 15-hour finish. "One thing I noticed is how surgy most people seemed to be though. Push the uphill, then coast the downhill. I was aiming for consistency, so I'd get dropped going uphill, then catch them on the downhill. Because I was faster on the downhill I had more momentum going into the uphills. This happened all day long." (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/1d85e8h/unbound_200_mile_race_recap_2024/)

**Zone-Based Pacing - COMPETITIVE:**
**Brennan Wertz [COMPETITIVE]:** "For long-distance events like the UNBOUND 200, I tell riders that their perceived effort level in the opening hours should feel almost TOO easy. If you use a power meter and know your zones, you want to be riding in the low-to-middle of your Zone 2—this is your ALL-DAY power." (https://abovecategory.com/blogs/journal/preparing-for-the-unbound-200)

**Nutrition - ELITE (120g/hr):**
**SomeMayoPlease [ELITE]:** "120 grams of carbs per hour in Skratch High-Carb, 1 SIS espresso every two hours (150mg)" for 10:13 finish (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/1d8dvkf/unbound_200_my_experience_pacing_strategy_tips/)

**Mettle Cycling [ELITE]:** "The target was around 120g of carbs per hour and even then, I miscalculated the leg between Aid 1 and Aid 2, running out of water and nutrition with 7 miles til I could refill. This detached me from the group I was in (that I later caught and passed) and mandated I take an extra 4 minutes to cool down and refuel." Combo of Never2nd bars, Flow carb mix, ELMNT hydration, Maurten gels/carb mix. (https://www.mettlecycling.com/post/unbound-200-2025-mettle-race-report)

**Nutrition - COMPETITIVE (100g/hr):**
**Isaiah Newkirk [COMPETITIVE]:** "I do extremely well sticking to around 100 g/hr—it allows me to perform well on 8+ hour rides and I experience little to no gut distress." (https://obedbikes.com/blogs/stories/10-tips-to-finish-the-unbound-gravel-200-or-any-long-gravel-race)

**Amy Charity [ELITE]:** "The kind of the tried and true method is approximately 250 calories an hour for somebody my size. And if you think you're going to take 13-ish hours to do the event, you're talking 3,000 to 4,000 calories in the day... If it's something that long, especially when the pace isn't as intense as that first 30 miles, I'll eat anything - I'll eat pizza, peanut butter and jelly, burritos - you name it, and its calories at that point." (https://www.cyclingnews.com/features/10-things-to-know-before-racing-unbound-gravel/)

**Nutrition - RECREATIONAL:**
**minidini10 [RECREATIONAL]:** Two 1L bottles with 75g carbs each, one 2L hydration pack with 150g carbs. "I had to pull over for nature breaks multiple times in the morning because I was trained for Texas heat and hydration intake." (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/1d85e8h/unbound_200_mile_race_recap_2024/)

**Aid Station Strategy:**
**minidini10 [RECREATIONAL]:** "I ate an Uncrustable, some wheat thins, swapped bottles and refilled my hydration pack. I reapplied sunscreen and chamois cream... I was in and out in five minutes." At second aid station: "I spent a few extra minutes chatting with my wife and going through my aid station checklist." (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/1d85e8h/unbound_200_mile_race_recap_2024/)

**Amy Charity [ELITE]:** "Even the fastest will get off their bikes (for the rest stops)... Even the fastest are stopping for a couple of minutes to just kind of regroup, get their bike in working order, kind of clean off, grab what they need, put some food down and then hit the road. The less time you spend at those stops helps. Every minute you spend sitting or standing there, it's just harder to get on the bike, it's harder to get your legs going again." (https://www.cyclingnews.com/features/10-things-to-know-before-racing-unbound-gravel/)

**Mental Strategy:**
**Amy Charity [ELITE]:** "You go through such deep moments of really worrying about if you can finish to feeling like you're okay, and that cycle would come and go repeatedly. And that was over a 13-hour period. I had to keep reminding myself 'you're just at a low point, you're going to come out of it', and I did." (https://www.cyclingnews.com/features/10-things-to-know-before-racing-unbound-gravel/)

**Jill Martindale [ELITE]:** "I like to split the distance up into chunks, planning at what mileage I'll stop or eat, so that it helps break the ride up into more manageable sections... I like to think of longer rides as a handful of separate rides; the slate is wiped clean each time I snack or grab some stuff out of my drop bag." (https://www.salsacycles.com/blogs/articles/finding-success-at-unbound-gravel)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Mechanical Issues:**
**Caroline Worrall [RECREATIONAL]:** Dropped chain at mile 42 that led to complete rear derailleur failure—chain stuck on 11-cog. Attempted to continue with only front chainring changes but eventually needed crew support at checkpoint. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/2021-unbound-gravel-200-by-gravel-newbie-not-any-more-caroline-worrall/)

**Isaiah Newkirk [COMPETITIVE]:** "Just as the thought crossed my mind that I might actually win the race, I heard what sounded like a gunshot and immediately felt my legs become covered in a layer of sealant from my rear wheel. I skidded to a halt... the slash in my tire was much too large for any sort of plug and ultimately required an inner tube and a waffle wrapper as a boot. I was forced to spend many minutes getting my rear wheel to a point where it would once again be rideable. While I was stopped on the side of the road struggling with my tire, I was passed by two of my competitors." (https://ircbike.com/blogs/news/unbound-gravel-race-report)

**Going Out Too Hard:**
**aydraper [RECREATIONAL]:** "I definitely messed this up in 2019. Went too hard the first 56 miles and slowed every 50 miles after... I had NP power and IF on my Wahoo and still couldn't control myself." Later noted: "My guess is that even the 16 hour group went out too hard. My goal is to beating the sun (I think around 14 hours and 25 min). In 2019 I was way ahead of pace at the 1st checkpoint (mile 56), on target at the neutral water stop at mile 103, and then fell off because I spent way too long at this stop and the 2nd checkpoint trying to let my back recover—which I didn't; just had to suffer back pains for the second 100 miles." (https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/unbound-gravel-race-recap/53441?page=9)

**Dehydration/Nutrition Failure:**
**Crystal Kovacs [ELITE]:** "After getting dehydrated at Unbound Gravel last year I now have a timer set on my Garmin. Every 15 minutes it chirps and I drink like Pavlov's dog!" (https://www.salsacycles.com/blogs/articles/finding-success-at-unbound-gravel)

**Mettle Cycling [ELITE]:** "I miscalculated the leg between Aid 1 and Aid 2, running out of water and nutrition with 7 miles til I could refill. This detached me from the group I was in" (https://www.mettlecycling.com/post/unbound-200-2025-mettle-race-report)

**minidini10 [RECREATIONAL]:** Observed "Lots of people were pulled over in the shade trying to rest or shake out cramps" in afternoon heat (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/1d85e8h/unbound_200_mile_race_recap_2024/)

**Crashes:**
**Mettle Cycling [ELITE]:** "Carbon wheels are getting pulverized by rocks popping out from under MTB tires, nervous riders are overlapping wheels creating that knob against knob zipper sound that usually leads to the slap of carbon frames and helmets hitting the deck... I hear crashes over my shoulder. The tension continues to escalate." (https://www.mettlecycling.com/post/unbound-200-2025-mettle-race-report)

**Brian McCulloch [COMPETITIVE]:** Mentioned "a number crashes at the front of the race that took down top-level competitors as the rocks, pot-holes, and other road conditions caused the predictable cramming" (https://ircbike.com/blogs/news/unbound-gravel-race-report)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Richard at SILCA [ELITE]:** "This race is special period and what I consider to be the best riding on earth. I love the Flint Hills of Kansas, everything about it is beautifully different. It's rugged, vast, and humid. It can be absolutely brutal with wheel-jamming unrideable mud on its worst days, and life altering on its best... That coin flip of beauty and brutality is what I think keeps people coming back, and why this event continues to grow." (https://silca.cc/blogs/silca/2024unboundgravel200)

**minidini10 [RECREATIONAL]:** "I made it to Lake Kahola and the residents were having a blast. There were so many people on course cheering on riders, it was great. I even got a beer handup right before sunset from a farmer." (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/1d85e8h/unbound_200_mile_race_recap_2024/)

**Brian McCulloch [COMPETITIVE]:** "Afterward I got cleaned up and returned to the finish area with JoyJoy for the ENVE Finish party to welcome finishers from 10PM-1AM. I was sure to grab a cowbell and thunder-sticks to make some noise for these conquerers! It was so cool to do to share some stoke with them as they finished long after the crowds had gone. It is a tradition that I will definitely participate with in years to come!" (https://ircbike.com/blogs/news/unbound-gravel-race-report)

**Laura Haraldson [ELITE]:** "In an endurance event like Unbound Gravel, we have the checkpoints, locals, and volunteers out there to help keep us safe, but between the checkpoints we have each other. Racing is great because it challenges us; we can go as fast as we want and make it a goal to podium. It's also great because there's always someone out there who shares our love of riding, and we get to ride and laugh together, bonding and building an amazing gravel community!" (https://www.salsacycles.com/blogs/articles/finding-success-at-unbound-gravel)

**Richard at SILCA [ELITE]:** "Growing from 34 racers in 2006 to an astonishing 5000 across all distances in 2024. Unbound makes Emporia the epic-center of gravel for one week every year. The best gravel cyclists in the world pour into town, from countries all over the world." (https://silca.cc/blogs/silca/2024unboundgravel200)

**Brian McCulloch [COMPETITIVE]:** Describing support: "I have had a crew person peel me an orange and let me dig through their food bins while they filled my water bottles and lubed my chain. I have also met riders on the course who shared their flat kits, support vans and ibuprofen when I needed help." (https://ircbike.com/blogs/news/unbound-gravel-race-report)

**Bertn05 [ELITE]:** "What an insane race this was. Everything I had expected and so much more, the days leading into the event, the race itself and the aftermath. What a great atmosphere." (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/1d8txts/unbound_200_after_all_your_tips_the_result/)
