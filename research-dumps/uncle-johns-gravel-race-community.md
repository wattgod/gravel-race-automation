# UNCLE JOHN'S GRAVEL RACE — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Sheri [ELITE]:** "I had an itch to do one more gravel race this season. Then the Uncle John's Gravel Race in St John's, Michigan, kept coming up in my Facebook feed. It must have been the gravel god's way of saying, 'Sheri, this is the race you need to ride.'" (https://sunflowersandpedals.com/2025/09/16/gravel-racing-at-uncle-johns-a-season-finisher-to-remember/)

**Sheri [ELITE]:** "The morning of the race was brisk, 43 degrees F, full sunshine, and breezy. The forecast called for the winds to be less than the previous two days, which were 20-30 mph and higher gusts. I kept second-guessing my kit choice, not wanting to freeze the first hour or two until the temperatures went above 55 degrees." (https://sunflowersandpedals.com/2025/09/16/gravel-racing-at-uncle-johns-a-season-finisher-to-remember/)

**Sheri [ELITE]:** "I thought to myself, this start line is a piece of cake after dealing with 1700 aggressive racers at Unbound Gravel." (https://sunflowersandpedals.com/2025/09/16/gravel-racing-at-uncle-johns-a-season-finisher-to-remember/)

**Sheri [ELITE]:** "Dan [race director] hopped on his jeep and led the swarm of riders on a neutral start out on a serpentine downhill at 18 mph. Everyone behaved with no close calls." (https://sunflowersandpedals.com/2025/09/16/gravel-racing-at-uncle-johns-a-season-finisher-to-remember/)

**Sheri [ELITE]:** "At around mile 15, one of the women finished a pull, was about to drift to the back, but went around a corner too fast. She went sliding across the road right in front of me, but I was able to avoid hitting her. The group slowed down enough to make sure she was ok before continuing. I had to shake off seeing someone crash, but I did take the corners more cautiously." (https://sunflowersandpedals.com/2025/09/16/gravel-racing-at-uncle-johns-a-season-finisher-to-remember/)

**Sheri [ELITE]:** "Around mile 40, the winds continued to build, but we were still averaging over 17 mph. I took a long pull into the wind, and then we hit a hill. It was just steep enough to shatter our tired band of riders, with three getting spit off the back. Yours truly was one of them." (https://sunflowersandpedals.com/2025/09/16/gravel-racing-at-uncle-johns-a-season-finisher-to-remember/)

**Sheri [ELITE]:** "As I'm pedaling along, an ambulance passes me on its way to scoop up a rider who went down hard. I found out later when I passed some of his buddies that they were in a huge pack and someone hit mud, went down hard, taking half the group down with him. Their buddy suffered a dislocated shoulder and/or broken collarbone." (https://sunflowersandpedals.com/2025/09/16/gravel-racing-at-uncle-johns-a-season-finisher-to-remember/)

**Sheri [ELITE]:** "Of course, the evil route creators had to put hills in at the end of the race. Nothing crazy steep or long, but enough to apply some hurt to already fatigued legs." (https://sunflowersandpedals.com/2025/09/16/gravel-racing-at-uncle-johns-a-season-finisher-to-remember/)

**Sheri [ELITE]:** "After chatting and exchanging contact info for Strava, I asked her [Melanie's] age – 42 years old. I laughed and revealed I was 20 years her senior. In fact, I was the oldest woman racing the 57-mile course, and only afterwards did I learn that I had been riding all day with several 40-year-old women." (https://sunflowersandpedals.com/2025/09/16/gravel-racing-at-uncle-johns-a-season-finisher-to-remember/)

**Sheri [ELITE]:** "When I took the podium for 1st place AG, the crowd gave me a hearty round of applause. It's awesome to show the 'younger generation' that age is simply a number. Will I do this race again? It was a resounding yes, the minute I crossed the finish line." (https://sunflowersandpedals.com/2025/09/16/gravel-racing-at-uncle-johns-a-season-finisher-to-remember/)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Sheri [ELITE]:** Used a Salsa Cutthroat with 45mm knobby tires (same setup as she used at Unbound Gravel). She notes it's "not the lightest racing bike, but reliable and soooo comfortable to ride." (https://sunflowersandpedals.com/2025/09/16/gravel-racing-at-uncle-johns-a-season-finisher-to-remember/)

**Vintage Bike Category [UNKNOWN]:** One rider raced a 1994 Cannondale M700 restomod (mountain bike converted to dropbar gravel with a 1x12 Sram GX groupset) in the new Vintage Bike category. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt1I5Ld1ULQ)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Course Character:** The course traverses "wooded game areas, flat & fast roads, and towering cornfields" with "super flat gravel roads lined with 10 foot high corn fields." 99% of the course is on dirt roads. Described as one of "the fastest gravel races in Michigan." (https://lmb.org/ride-calendar/uncle-johns-dirty-ride/ and https://ilovegravelracing.com/event/uncle-johns-gravel-race/)

**Specific Course Areas:** Riders go through the "wooded Saginaw/Gratiot Game Area" and also through flat sections with tall corn. The course winds "through corn fields and apple orchards for the final leg of the race." (https://sunflowersandpedals.com/2025/09/16/gravel-racing-at-uncle-johns-a-season-finisher-to-remember/)

**Late-Race Hills:** Sheri [ELITE] noted: "Of course, the evil route creators had to put hills in at the end of the race. Nothing crazy steep or long, but enough to apply some hurt to already fatigued legs." These hills appear around mile 52 of the 57-mile course. (https://sunflowersandpedals.com/2025/09/16/gravel-racing-at-uncle-johns-a-season-finisher-to-remember/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Sheri [ELITE] - 57 Mile Strategy:** "Relying on perceived exertion (PE), I left the Garmin Edge on the course screen, and I quickly settled into a pace I could hold for 57 miles." She intended to race alone initially without drafting in a pack she didn't know. (https://sunflowersandpedals.com/2025/09/16/gravel-racing-at-uncle-johns-a-season-finisher-to-remember/)

**Sheri [ELITE] - Group Dynamics:** Around mile 8, she realized she was pulling a group. The impromptu group of solo riders worked together, but "everyone was pulling at different speeds. Sometimes my heart was pounding out of my chest, and at other times I could sit up and coast." Despite the variability, staying with the group was beneficial for battling winds. (https://sunflowersandpedals.com/2025/09/16/gravel-racing-at-uncle-johns-a-season-finisher-to-remember/)

**Sheri [ELITE] - Pack Pace:** The group maintained over 17 mph average through mile 40 despite building winds. (https://sunflowersandpedals.com/2025/09/16/gravel-racing-at-uncle-johns-a-season-finisher-to-remember/)

**Sheri [ELITE] - Nutrition Setup:** "I was able to stay on top of my nutrition with a USWE hydration pack loaded with Tailwind High Carb Mix and figs in my feedbag. Unfortunately, the SaltStick FastChews were not accessible, which was poor planning on my part." (https://sunflowersandpedals.com/2025/09/16/gravel-racing-at-uncle-johns-a-season-finisher-to-remember/)

**Sheri [ELITE] - Late Race Cooperation:** After getting dropped around mile 40, she caught another dropped rider (Melanie) and offered to work together: "We swapped pulls about every half mile until around mile 52, where we hit some hills." (https://sunflowersandpedals.com/2025/09/16/gravel-racing-at-uncle-johns-a-season-finisher-to-remember/)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Crashes in Packs:** Major crash reported where "someone hit mud, went down hard, taking half the group down with him" resulting in "a dislocated shoulder and/or broken collarbone" for one rider.

**Wind-Induced Splits:** Around mile 40, a hill combined with wind was "just steep enough to shatter our tired band of riders, with three getting spit off the back." The wind became a major struggle factor in the second half. (https://sunflowersandpedals.com/2025/09/16/gravel-racing-at-uncle-johns-a-season-finisher-to-remember/)
