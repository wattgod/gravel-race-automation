# USA CYCLING GRAVEL NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIPS — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Zach Nehr [COMPETITIVE]:** "Ten minutes into the USA Gravel National Championships, I watched Chase Wark attack up the left side of a Minnesota highway. It was a doomed move, I thought, going into the early breakaway on a 98-mile course with over 7,000 feet of climbing... Little did I know that these riders wouldn't get caught until five miles to go. Even then, they had enough left in the tank to finish 2nd (Garrison) and 5th (Wark)." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/what-its-like-competing-pro-gravel-race/)

**Zach Nehr [COMPETITIVE]:** "I pushed 471w (6.7w/kg) for five minutes and nearly got dropped. But I dug deep over the top of the climb, wheezing and suffering, but still in the main group. I looked back to see the damage that had been done, expecting to see 10-15 riders left... To my disbelief, there were still over 30 riders in the peloton." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/what-its-like-competing-pro-gravel-race/)

**Zach Nehr [COMPETITIVE]:** "I was dropped with two and a half hours to go. From the moment I was dropped, I pushed 293w (NP 323w) for 50 miles and still lost 13 minutes to the lead group – that's how fast they were going." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/what-its-like-competing-pro-gravel-race/)

**Bradyn Lange [ELITE]:** "It was an interesting race. It didn't start out too hard, a break had about four minutes, and then it just kind of turned into survival on the final climbs. I bridged to the final group with about ten miles to go, and there were five of us heading into the final section, which suited me well as a mountain biker. I hit it on the first kicker, got away, and held it to the finish." (https://www.cyclingweekly.com/gravel/us-gravel-nationals-lauren-stephens-powers-to-third-straight-title-bradyn-lange-wins-with-breakthrough-performance)

**Lauren Stephens [ELITE]:** "The race was the hardest one we've had so far. Every climb, the group would splinter and kind of have a selection. Finally, at the southern end of the course, we were a selection of six or seven riders. What made the race was quite a muddy, slick section where a few riders went down, and that was the point that made the race. The following climb, Sarah Lange and I pulled away from Emily Newsome, and from then on we worked together all the way to the final steep cyclocross kicker, and I was able to pull off the win out of that section." (https://www.cyclingweekly.com/gravel/us-gravel-nationals-lauren-stephens-powers-to-third-straight-title-bradyn-lange-wins-with-breakthrough-performance)

**Pete Stetina [ELITE]:** "I was one of the early victims [in the mass pileup at mile 27] and became a landing pad for other riders and their bikes. All told maybe 20 went down, and half wouldn't continue on. Luckily landing in dirt isn't as bad a pavement and I was miraculously ok. My bike was another story however: I took a few minutes of roadside maintenance and got it rideable. But upon investigating deeper on the fly, I discovered more damage, some of it catastrophic." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/usac-gravel-national-championship/)

**Pete Stetina [ELITE]:** "It stings to put time, money, and energy into a race only to leave before I was even tired or hungry. My string of bad luck in races all summer long continues, something I'm really frustrated with. I'm just pining for a clean run." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/usac-gravel-national-championship/)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Tire Choice - Zach Nehr [COMPETITIVE]:** "Looking around the elite field, I was confident in my tire choice: 45mm Panaracer X1s. There were a handful of riders running semi-slick tires, which were undoubtedly faster in a straight line, albeit slippery in the corners... I noticed that most of the riders running semi-slicks are (or have been) professional mountain bikers. These are the riders you see on Instagram doing no-handed wheelies and bunny-hopping a park bench. My skill level is nowhere near these professionals', and I suffered as a consequence. My tire choice was the correct one for my skillset." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/what-its-like-competing-pro-gravel-race/)

**Bike Setup - Zach Nehr [COMPETITIVE]:** "My tire choice was the correct one for my skillset, and so was my bike with the Lauf Seigla. There were washboards all over the Nationals course, including some on the 40mph descents. The Lauf's Grit fork helped dampen the extreme vibrations, and I saw multiple riders on other setups experiencing fork shudders, crashes, or other mechanicals on the descents. The Seigla also has massive tire clearance, which came in handy during the mile-long mud section. I heard of at least five crashes in that section, but I was able to get through unscathed." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/what-its-like-competing-pro-gravel-race/)

**Equipment List - Zach Nehr [COMPETITIVE]:** "ROKA San Remo Air with Photochromic lenses, Le Col Pro Speed Suit, custom Joyseat by Posedla, ABUS Gamechanger helmet, PEARL iZUMi PRO Road shoes, Wahoo ELEMNT ROAM 3, USWE hydration pack, and SiS caffeine gels from The Feed. The best change I made from previous races was using sunglasses with photochromic lenses. I cannot tell you how important this one piece of equipment was, especially during a race where we started at sunrise, rode through pouring rain, and finished in the sun. The photochromic lenses automatically adjust their tint, which means that you can ride through all light conditions with the same pair of glasses." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/what-its-like-competing-pro-gravel-race/)

**Tire Width Context:** "Amid the ongoing 'big tyre' debate in gravel, Minnesota favoured setups closer to 40mm rather than the 2.2-inch widths common at Unbound, Big Sugar or Mid South." (https://www.cyclingweekly.com/gravel/us-gravel-nationals-lauren-stephens-powers-to-third-straight-title-bradyn-lange-wins-with-breakthrough-performance)

## Weather Experienced

**2025 Minnesota Race - Zach Nehr [COMPETITIVE]:** Race conditions included "starting at sunrise, rode through pouring rain, and finished in the sun" with photochromic lenses being critical equipment. (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/what-its-like-competing-pro-gravel-race/)

**2023 Nebraska Race - Pete Stetina [ELITE]:** "As the sun rose, the wind was at our back and the speed was high" with significant crosswinds and sand being major factors throughout the race. (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/usac-gravel-national-championship/)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Minnesota Course (2025) - Zach Nehr [COMPETITIVE]:** "Each climb was 5-7 minutes long with an average gradient of 6-10%. There were plenty of steep sections around 15%, which meant that grip and traction would be crucial in the toughest moments of the race... What goes up must come down, and that meant we would be flying down gravel descents at over 40 mph. Riding down a 10% grade is fast enough on the road. Now picture 50 elite riders racing down the same descent, through wet gravel corners, fighting for position before the U-turn at the bottom." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/what-its-like-competing-pro-gravel-race/)

**Minnesota Descents - Zach Nehr [COMPETITIVE]:** "I got dropped on most of the gravel descents — I thought that riding through a -10% gravel corner at 35 mph would be fast enough, but I was still getting gapped by some of the best bike handlers I'd ever seen. And therein lies a difference-maker on this course: tire choice and bike-handling skills." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/what-its-like-competing-pro-gravel-race/)

**Minnesota Final Climb (2025):** "Instead of rolling into town for a simple sprint finish, we turned left into Stoney Point Park on the edge of La Crescent. The first part of the climb was everything you would expect: 11% of gravel, a little chunky, but nothing too bad. But then, your eyes gaze up at the road in front of you... it was a 30% wall made of loose dirt and broken dreams." Bradyn Lange did 390w (6w/kg) for 2:23 over this 700-meter section and was going 4.2 mph on the final climb. (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/what-its-like-competing-pro-gravel-race/)

**Minnesota Mud Section (2025) - Lauren Stephens [ELITE]:** "What made the race was quite a muddy, slick section where a few riders went down, and that was the point that made the race." (https://www.cyclingweekly.com/gravel/us-gravel-nationals-lauren-stephens-powers-to-third-straight-title-bradyn-lange-wins-with-breakthrough-performance)

**Nebraska Course (2023) - Pete Stetina [ELITE]:** "The course was dynamic. It was fast. Wind and sand pits would be a major factor, but there were enough hills and short two-track sections to break things up. The finale had a steep climb 20 miles out and a technical section for a last minute attack in the final three miles." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/usac-gravel-national-championship/)

**Minnesota General Terrain Description:** "Riders will wind their way through hardwood forests, farm fields, trout stream valleys, and ridge-top gravel roads... What defines all these routes is their relentlessness. There is almost no flat ground; riders are either grinding up sustained 400–500 foot climbs or barreling down fast, winding descents. Local riders call it 'champagne gravel' because of the smooth surfaces in the fall, but the speed and pitch make it anything but easy."

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Elite Men's Power Outputs - Zach Nehr [COMPETITIVE]:** "KOM #2: 5:00 at 471w (6.7w/kg)" and "KOM #3: 3 minutes at 6.8w/kg" and "KOM #4: 500w for two minutes." After being dropped: "pushed 293w (NP 323w) for 50 miles and still lost 13 minutes to the lead group." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/what-its-like-competing-pro-gravel-race/)

**Elite Men's Winner Power - Bradyn Lange [ELITE]:** On the final climb with 1km to go, Lange did "Time: 2:13, Steepest Section: 100m at 25.4%" and was pushing "close to 500w after 4,000+ kJs" at 4.2 mph. (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/what-its-like-competing-pro-gravel-race/)

**Elite Men's Second Place Power - Alexey Vermeulen [ELITE]:** Did "390w (6w/kg) for 2:23 over this 700-meter section" on the final climb but Lange was 10 seconds faster. (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/what-its-like-competing-pro-gravel-race/)

**Nutrition Strategy - Zach Nehr [COMPETITIVE]:** "I had studied the course and studied my competitors. I calculated the exact amount of nutrition I would need throughout the day (~700g of carbs)" for a race that took approximately 4.5 hours. (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/what-its-like-competing-pro-gravel-race/)

**Aid Station Strategy - Zach Nehr [COMPETITIVE]:** "Unlike the self-supported Lauf Gravel Worlds, US Gravel Nationals included four aid stations along the 98-mile route. That was more than enough to get through four and a half hours of racing, and I was lucky enough to have my fiancée and dad handing off my bottles." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/what-its-like-competing-pro-gravel-race/)

**Critical Attack Point:** "And then, something happened that I was completely unprepared for. We turned right into the town of Eitzen, and there was the aid station, a paved downhill at 35 mph. Brennan Wertz attacked through the aid station because 500 meters later, there was a super technical gravel descent." This attack sequence split the race decisively. (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/what-its-like-competing-pro-gravel-race/)

**Nebraska Early Race Tactics - Pete Stetina [ELITE]:** "As the sun rose, the wind was at our back and the speed was high, making for an un-selective scenario despite a flurry of attacks. The one exception was John Borstelmann clipping of the front with two others. At the first major hill, Keegan and I forced the pace and the pack started to whittle." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/usac-gravel-national-championship/)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Mass Pileup Risk - Pete Stetina [ELITE]:** "At mile 27, a rider in the top 10 crossed wheels and went down at high speed. This created a domino effect and mass pileup. I was one of the early victims and became a landing pad for other riders and their bikes. All told maybe 20 went down, and half wouldn't continue on." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/usac-gravel-national-championship/)

**Mechanical Failures - Zach Nehr [COMPETITIVE]:** Reports of "fork shudders, crashes, or other mechanicals on the descents" for riders without proper suspension or equipment. "I heard of at least five crashes in that section [mile-long mud section]." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/what-its-like-competing-pro-gravel-race/)

**Descending Skills:** "I got dropped on most of the gravel descents" because riders with better bike handling skills could maintain 40+ mph on technical descents while others had to slow to 35 mph, creating gaps. "A difference-maker on this course: tire choice and bike-handling skills." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/what-its-like-competing-pro-gravel-race/)

**Weather-Related Crashes - Lauren Stephens [ELITE]:** "What made the race was quite a muddy, slick section where a few riders went down, and that was the point that made the race." This crash sequence split the lead women's group from 6-7 riders down to 3. (https://www.cyclingweekly.com/gravel/us-gravel-nationals-lauren-stephens-powers-to-third-straight-title-bradyn-lange-wins-with-breakthrough-performance)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Sanctioned Race Atmosphere - Pete Stetina [ELITE]:** "The expo was quite sparse — there was a major lack of industry presence. I'm not sure if that was due to the late announcement when most marketing budgets were spoken for, or if the industry was also waiting with bated breath. As a result, I didn't feel the sense of impending two-wheeled adventure with the masses that one does at events like Unbound or Mid South." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/usac-gravel-national-championship/)

**Race vs. Festival Vibe - Pete Stetina [ELITE]:** "The event gave off the vibe of a race, and the riders who came were there more for the competition and less about the mass gathering. I slid into that mode; this weekend was to be about performance only. Without any sponsor obligations and not much happening around the expo, I flipped the racer switch on and retreated to the hotel to ready for the next day." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/usac-gravel-national-championship/)

**USAC Officials - Pete Stetina [ELITE]:** "The official USAC 'blue shirt' vibe was present but seemed more friendly and relaxed rather than stiff and regulatory." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/usac-gravel-national-championship/)

**Production Quality - Pete Stetina [ELITE]:** "The finish line arch was impressive. The fencing, signage en route, and the communications were all dialed. This would be the safest gravel event I'd ever experienced: the front group had a rolling full road closure, and the traffic control was prominent." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/usac-gravel-national-championship/)

**National Anthem - Pete Stetina [ELITE]:** "We were sent off into the Nebraska plains by one of the better National Anthems I've ever heard; the man who sang had bellows for lungs!" (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/usac-gravel-national-championship/)

**Local Festival Integration:** "The championship coincides with La Crescent's Apple Fest, a long-standing local celebration that includes a parade, carnival rides, and a 5K. While it may make the town busier, it also means extra activities for families who come along to spectate." (https://www.thenxrth.com/post/gravel-nationals-2025-preview-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-race-routes-watching-festivities)

**What It Means - Pete Stetina [ELITE]:** "If you want to race gravel in a safe and competitive environment, I highly recommend it. If you want to have a big communal gathering with the fun extracurriculars, I'd suggest you look elsewhere — for now. This felt like a classic race in every sense of the word." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/usac-gravel-national-championship/)

**Prize Money Significance:** "$60,000 prize purse ($30k male/female)! My jaw dropped, USAC had never had prize money at any road or mountain bike nationals, the only thing on the line was a patriotic jersey. This was the biggest single day purse in gravel. Ever." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/usac-gravel-national-championship/)
