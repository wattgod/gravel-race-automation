- Some climbs described as "Driftless monsters" (over 400 feet vertical, 14%+ grades)

**Surface Quality:**
- Locals call it "champagne gravel" due to smooth fall surfaces
- Tire recommendations: 40mm range (unlike Unbound which favors 2.2-inch widths)
- 2025 course had a controversial "goat track" section and muddy areas near Hokah

### Nebraska Terrain (2023-2024)
- High plains gravel roads

- Gravel Worlds allows them but not when riding in groups

---

## 12. Forum Discussions and Community Sentiment

### Bike Forums Discussion (2025 Course)
From bikeforums.net thread on 2025 course:
- **Tire concerns:** Riders worried about 35mm slicks on 20% loose gravel slopes
- **Post-race feedback:** 98.5% of course called "genuinely fantastic"
- **Criticism:** Muddy section at Hokah and "goat track" at end received negative feedback
- **Gradient debate:** Discussion over whether 40%+ grades were accurate
- **Quote:** "If I wanted to race cyclocross, I would have signed up for a cyclocross race. Mud is stupid."

### Spirit of Gravel Debate
The championship exists amid ongoing tension in the gravel community:

**Arguments against institutionalization:**
- Fear that USA Cycling involvement will "quash the discipline's good vibes"
- Concern about losing grassroots, inclusive origins
- Some feel "the spirit of gravel is dead"

**Arguments for the championship:**
- "Gravel racing is one of the few categories of growth in American cycling"
- Provides safety standards lacking in grassroots events
- Creates legitimate competitive pathway
- USA Cycling CEO: "For those who say, 'so you're making this into a road race?' I say, 'no, this is for safety.'"

**Funding clarification from USA Cycling CEO Brendan Quirk:**
- "We're not using a cent of membership dues to fund it"
- "Not diverting funds from grassroots racing programs"
- "100 percent of the prizes will be funded by entry fees and sponsorship"

### Recognition of Sport Evolution
Quirk acknowledged: "It's obvious that gravel has reached an inflection point where it's two sports in one. You have 'Spirit of Gravel' events that skew to the social experience, then you have legit, knives-out slugfests."
