# UWHARRIE FOREST GRAVEL GRINDER — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**The Infamous "Jeep Climb" / Falls Dam Trail:**
The course features what riders consistently call the "Jeep Climb" or "Falls Dam Trail" — a signature feature that defines this race. Multiple video sources document riders attempting this climb, with one [UNKNOWN] rider noting: "Can you climb the entire way, or will it be hiking a bike?" (https://www.granfondoguide.com/Events/Index/9346/uwharrie-forest-gravel-grinder)

One [UNKNOWN] rider described their third pass over the climb: "This was my third and final time up the climb in the 2022 Uwharrie Forest Gravel Grinder. By this point, I had been dropped by the 2 leaders (Keith Gerarden and Matt Edwards, with Jeff Terebey..." — indicating the 82-mile course includes multiple passes of major climbs.

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Tire Choice Discussion [UNKNOWN level]:**
One rider posted asking for advice on the long course: "Never ridden there before and trying to decide what tires to use. Options are: Challenge Gravel Grinders 38, Cinturato M 40, Vittoria Wet 38... Right now, thinking of the 40 Cinturato in the back and Vittoria 38 in front (which seemed to work fine on DuPont Forest gravel last week)." They noted comfort preference for the Challenge tires but expressed concern about "the central file tread."

**Single Speed Participation [UNKNOWN level]:**
At least one rider documented completing the 2022 race on a single speed setup, indicating the course is rideable (though challenging) without gears. (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/ugqhog/uwharrie_forest_gravel_grinder_2022_single_speed/)

**E-Bike Category:**
The race offers non-competitive E-Bike categories for both long and short courses, suggesting some riders find the terrain demanding enough to warrant pedal assistance. (https://www.trans-sylvaniaproductions.com/ufgg)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Aid Station Locations:**
- **Long Course:** Aid stations at miles 21, 24, 46, and 49
- **Short Course:** Aid stations at miles 21 and 24

The long course has a significant gap between mile 24 and mile 46 (22 miles) with no aid, requiring strategic nutrition planning. (https://www.trans-sylvaniaproductions.com/ufgg)

**Elite Performance Data [ELITE level]:**
2022 results show the winning times:
- **27-Mile Overall Winner:** Chris Hladik, 1:38:18 (Men 45+)
- **55-Mile Overall Winner:** James Pearl, 3:10:53 (Open Men)
- **82-Mile Overall Winner:** Keith Gerarden, 4:32:45 (Open Men)

These times indicate the 55-mile course (similar to current long course distance) was completed by the winner at approximately 17.3 mph average, suggesting challenging terrain relative to distance. (https://www.webscorer.com/race?raceid=274746)
