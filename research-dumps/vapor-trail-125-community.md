**Katie [COMPETITIVE]:** Scratched at Aid 3 due to developing sinus infection. "I felt so smooth racing along the Colorado Trail under a full moon.

On Alpine Tunnel climb: "I was so surprised I could clear those short power climbs with my new XX1 drivetrain—I was riding a 32 chain ring up front and was worried I went too big." On Canyon Creek descent: "The descent turned out to be more painful than the climb. I could hear myself thinking, 'man, I would rather be climbing right now.' My hands and triceps were throbbing." At Aid 2, told "you're the first" and didn't believe it. On final section: "After a full night of climbing, my legs, butt, and mind were exhausted.

**Continental Divide Trail Addition (2024):** Anonymous Singletracks: "This section of singletrack was a new addition for 2024 and it was AWESOME!

(https://www.singletracks.com/community/race-report-vapor-trail-125-salida-co/)

**Canyon Creek Descent (10 miles, 3500' loss):** Eric Henderson: "bone-rattling for the first half and smooth and flowy with a few scattered technical sections in the second half." Anonymous Singletracks: "The descent turned out to be more painful than the climb... My hands and triceps were throbbing... It was wet and I was taking it slow, since there's no sense in hurting yourself out in the middle of nowhere."

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Start Strategy [ELITE]:** Race Director Mike Franco's advice: "Start slow, and then go even slower." Anonymous Singletracks: "After the neutral roll-out to HWY 285, the pace seemed slower then I anticipated. One thing I was nervous about prior to the race was the number of strong, accomplished riders that were registered. I figured a bunch of riders would go out and smash it right off the bat, but that was not the case." (https://bikepacking.com/plog/2024-vapor-trail-125-gallery/ and https://www.singletracks.com/community/race-report-vapor-trail-125-salida-co/)

**Pacing for "Flatlanders" [ELITE]:** Anonymous Singletracks: "For whatever reason, I didn't feel all that great.

**Climbing Strategy [ELITE]:** Anonymous Singletracks on Chalk Creek: "nice, easy railroad grade climb... The gradient was perfect for me to just stand and turn the pedals over without a lot of effort but with good speed. Enough so that I caught and passed 4-5 people on this climb."

(https://www.singletracks.com/community/race-report-vapor-trail-125-salida-co/)

**Nutrition Failure [COMPETITIVE]:** Becky Gardner: "After a derailleur mechanical in hour two, I decided to ride as fast as I could without stopping to eat until the first aid station at almost 2 am. This caused me to have trouble eating most of the first half of the race." (https://www.konaworld.com/blogs/cog/becky-and-ryan-gardner-battle-vapor-trail-125)

**Aid Station Error [ELITE]:** Anonymous Singletracks: "I regret not eating any food there [final aid station]; in hindsight, it was a big mistake.

**Pre-Race Acclimatization:** Eric Henderson (coming from 700' elevation): "gave myself a few days to bathe my lungs with the thin air. I arrived in Salida on a Wednesday and immediately assembled my bike and headed up to Monarch Crest Trail at over 11,000' to pedal around and see how I felt. Overall, I only had some mild shortness of breath with exertion." (https://erichenderson1.blogspot.com/2024/09/vapor-trail-125.html)

**Training with Limited Time [ELITE]:** Kathy Duryea: "only had 8 weeks to train by the time I signed up, but I found a great program through Tim Cusick and the Basecamp cycling program to take me from my 16-week winter training program to an 8-week summer mountain-bike-specific program." (https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/kathys-story-vapor-trail-125)

**Training Approach [COMPETITIVE]:** Becky & Ryan Gardner: "tried to ride as much steep vertical as we could find.

(https://www.konaworld.com/blogs/cog/becky-and-ryan-gardner-battle-vapor-trail-125 and https://www.themountainmail.com/news/vapor-trail-sees-record-turn-out-two-new-course-records-set/article_b0e96418-ab4b-413a-b964-37185dcc944e.html)

**Nutrition/Bonking:** Anonymous Singletracks: "I started to slow my pace. A lot goes through your head in a race like this, but more so towards the end. 'Can I hold on to first? Will I completely bonk and not even finish in the top 5?'" (https://www.singletracks.com/community/race-report-vapor-trail-125-salida-co/)

**Illness:** Katie had developing sinus infection before race: "I don't want an excuse for my performance, but maybe trusting the people around me to tell them how I'm really feeling is the last lesson Vapor Trail had for me this year."

(https://www.joinbasecamp.com/post/kathys-story-vapor-trail-125)

**Light Failures:** Dane De Voy: "early demise of his headlamp. De Voy still had a light on his handlebars, but said it was hard to see around corners without the second light. Plus the broken spoke resulted in a couple 'small' crashes." (https://www.themountainmail.com/news/vapor-trail-sees-record-turn-out-two-new-course-records-set/article_b0e96418-ab4b-413a-b964-37185dcc944e.html)
