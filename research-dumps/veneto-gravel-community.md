# VENETO GRAVEL — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Claudia Gerosa [RECREATIONAL]:** "VENETO GRAVEL does not claim to be a bike race - it has no allusions when it comes to that. Instead, it's an adventure that takes you through an incredible nature, new sights, rural Northern Italy, rolling hills, and the postcard-perfect cities and towns of Veneto... We set ourselves a two-and-a-half day limit, setting off on Friday afternoon and splitting the 400 km Short Beach into three stages with pre-selected hotels each night." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-veneto-gravel-2023)

**Stefano Rodighiero [UNKNOWN]:** "Over the last weekend I partecipated to my second Venetogravel. This time following the Short Beach track, covering approximately 400 kilometers and 2200 meters of elevation. The weather in the first two day was not the best, but I still enjoyed it very much." His stats showed: Day 1: 132km in 6:43 moving time (19.6 km/h avg), Day 2: 111km in 5:38 moving time (19.7 km/h avg), Day 3: 101km in 6:16 moving time (16.2 km/h avg), Day 4: 53.3km in 3:09 moving time (16.9 km/h avg).

**Anonymous blogger [RECREATIONAL]:** "Mai percorso più di 160km in una botta sola.. sto giro partendo da Bassano e passando per il mare sono arrivato a casa a 250km in circa 12 ore" [Never ridden more than 160km in one go before... this time starting from Bassano and passing through the sea I got home at 250km in about 12 hours]. First time exceeding 160km, completed 250km of the route in ~12 hours. (https://bolg.gsng.eu/root/2025/04-25--27_veneto-gravel-2025.html)

**Anonymous rider [RECREATIONAL]:** "Disclaimer, this is my first time riding a loaded bike by night, in a 2 days event. I usually ride on the road with my road bike... I loved it and in the descent I could at almost 60kph." Completed in 2 days as a first bikepacking experience. (https://www.reddit.com/r/bikepacking/comments/1c9rdic/my_setup_for_the_veneto_gravel/)

**Anonymous rider [UNKNOWN]:** "My Veneto Gravel started on Friday the 19th of April around 2:30pm, I completed it on Sundaty the 21th of April at 8:59pm. It has been a real challenge in a beautiful region." Completed the Classic 700k route in approximately 54 hours elapsed time. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzPcJVTJX74)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Miss Grape Setup [RECREATIONAL]:** One rider used Miss Grape bags for the Short Beach route and reported: "I loved it and in the descent I could at almost 60kph. Also the bike is fairly new since it's the 4th time that I've used it." Setup was stable enough for high-speed descents on a relatively new bike. (https://www.reddit.com/r/bikepacking/comments/1c9rdic/my_setup_for_the_veneto_gravel/)

**Bike Choice - Official Guidance [ALL LEVELS]:** Event allows "any bike: MTB, road bike, fat bike, plus, e-bike" but organizers state "the ideal bike is a gravel bike." Tire clearance recommendation of approximately 30mm for the varied terrain. (https://venetogravel.it/en/)

**Gravel-Specific Setup [RECREATIONAL]:** Claudia Gerosa noted riding "in nature with a hand always ready to take a photo" suggesting lighter, more accessible setups work well for the non-competitive approach. (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-veneto-gravel-2023)

## Weather Experienced

**2023 Edition:** Claudia Gerosa reported generally good conditions, focusing on scenic riding without major weather complaints. (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-veneto-gravel-2023)

**2024 Edition:** Multiple riders noted challenging conditions. One rider reported "Sun, rain, wind, more wind, thunderstorms but also a lot of laughter." (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIoIi7kX4d0)

**2025 Edition (Short Beach):** Stefano Rodighiero noted "The weather in the first two day was not the best, but I still enjoyed it very much." Day 3 showed significantly slower speed (16.2 km/h vs ~19.7 km/h days 1-2), possibly weather-related. (https://stefanorodighiero.net/blog/venetogravel-2025.html)

Another 2025 rider mentioned "thick, dark clouds looming over the mountains" but "almost no rain" despite ominous skies. (https://bolg.gsng.eu/root/2025/04-25--27_veneto-gravel-2025.html)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Route Variety:** Riders consistently note the diverse terrain. One blogger described: "rivers, countryside, rural landscapes, natural and coastal environments, up to the foot of the Dolomites. A varied and surprising route, capable of changing face with every kilometer." (https://venetogravel.it/en/)

**Specific Sections [RECREATIONAL perspective]:**
- **Valpolicella Hills:** "A bit of fun technical riding on easy singletrack" between Verona and Lake Garda (https://www.skedaddle.com/blog/the-story-behind-gravel-trails-of-veneto/)
- **Lapisina Valley:** Route differs from obvious paths - "I knew parts of the route from a few years back when I rode from Cavallino on the Lagoon to Auronzo, but the organizers picked a slightly different path through the Lapisina valley" (https://bolg.gsng.eu/root/2025/04-25--27_veneto-gravel-2025.html)
- **Passo San Boldo:** Specifically mentioned as a memorable section (https://bolg.gsng.eu/root/2025/04-25--27_veneto-gravel-2025.html)
- **"Cento giorni" Piave section:** Noted as distinctive (https://bolg.gsng.eu/root/2025/04-25--27_veneto-gravel-2025.html)

**Walking Sections:** "There even are some sections that are meant to be walked, pushing the bike. They're on the route because they offer some phenomenal sightseeing that couldn't be found otherwise." (https://bolg.gsng.eu/root/2025/04-25--27_veneto-gravel-2025.html)

**Checkpoints:** "Along the route, Veneto Gravel checkpoints await you: places to take a break" - stamps required for brevet completion. (https://venetogravel.it/en/)

**Elevation Profile Differences by Route:**
- Classic: 720km, 4,300m elevation
- Short Beach: 400km, 2,800m elevation  
- Short Lake: 400km, 1,800m elevation
- Newbie: 200km, 2,800m elevation
(Note: Newbie has same elevation as Short Beach but half the distance - significantly steeper profile) (https://venetogravel.it/en/)

**Surface Conditions:** "The gravel road network in the Veneto plain is defined by its waterways. Much of the riding is alongside rivers and canals." Canal roads described as "mostly unpaved." (https://www.skedaddle.com/blog/the-story-behind-gravel-trails-of-veneto/)

**Route Changes:** "Changes to the route this year due to avalanches" - 2025 edition had to adapt. (https://bolg.gsng.eu/root/2025/04-25--27_veneto-gravel-2025.html)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Multi-Day Approaches [RECREATIONAL]:**

**2.5-Day Strategy:** Claudia Gerosa split Short Beach 400km as: Day 1: 105km (Bassano to Quarto d'Altino), Day 2: 156km (Quarto d'Altino to Vittorio Veneto), Day 3: 139km (Vittorio Veneto to Bassano). Pre-booked hotels each night. (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/ride-ride-report-veneto-gravel-2023)

**4-5 Day Relaxed Pace:** "For those who aren't used to riding uninterrupted, you can split your route into four days and take up the entire allocated time." Event allows Friday start through Tuesday finish (5 days maximum). (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-veneto-gravel-2023)

**Stefano's 4-Day Split [UNKNOWN]:** 400km Short Beach completed as: 132km, 111km, 101km, 53km over 4 days with approximately 6-8 hours moving time per day, averaging 16-20 km/h. (https://stefanorodighiero.net/blog/venetogravel-2025.html)

**Fast Approaches:**

**2-Day Push [RECREATIONAL]:** "My first time riding a loaded bike by night, in a 2 days event" - completed successfully by road cyclist new to bikepacking. (https://www.reddit.com/r/bikepacking/comments/1c9rdic/my_setup_for_the_veneto_gravel/)

**54-Hour Classic [UNKNOWN]:** 700km Classic completed Friday 2:30pm start to Sunday 8:59pm finish (~54 hours elapsed). Likely included sleep/rest but specific schedule not detailed. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzPcJVTJX74)

**Flexibility Philosophy:** "Some complete the route in one go, some sleep under the stars in a sleeping bag, some stop for a hot meal in a Venetian tavern or rest in a structure along the route. There are no rules, except the ones you choose." (https://venetogravel.it/en/)

**Start Time Considerations:** Multiple riders mention afternoon/evening starts (2:30pm, 4:45pm) suggesting strategy of riding into first night to cover easier terrain, then sleeping before mountain sections. (https://venetogravel.it/en/ and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb0_P4HMars)

**Competitive Element (Despite "Not A Race"):** "While Veneto Gravel explicitly claims not to be a race, a certain cohort of riders will go hard and embrace the challenge against the clock (their own, in this case) and against themselves. There will have been riders, I'm sure, that only slept for a few stolen hours or minutes on edge of the dirt roads or in a nice-looking grassy spot." (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-veneto-gravel-2023)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Scale:** "More than 1300 participants embarked on the ride" in 2025, making it "the biggest gravel bikepacking event in Europe." Previous editions: 328 cyclists in 2023, organizers hoped for 400+ in next edition. (https://bolg.gsng.eu/root/2025/04-25--27_veneto-gravel-2025.html and https://3t.bike/blogs/news/venetogravel-the-longest-gravel-ride-in-europe)

**International Draw:** "Cyclists from all over the world come to Veneto" with "participants from over 20 countries" gathering annually. (https://venetogravel.it/en/)

**Non-Competitive Culture:** "Veneto Gravel non è una gara!" [Veneto Gravel is not a race!] emphasized throughout. "No time trials, just the pure experience of bikepacking, without pressure or competition." Instead of results list, "you'll sign your name on the finisher's board." (https://venetogravel.it/en/ and https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-veneto-gravel-2023)

**Social Riding:** Video description mentions "a lot of laughter" during challenging weather conditions, suggesting friendly group dynamics. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIoIi7kX4d0)

**Event Infrastructure:** "At the starting village, where you'll be welcomed by our staff, receive your event pack, and immediately soak up the unique atmosphere of the event, meeting other participants from all over Italy and abroad." Finish includes "showers available and a delicious meal, included in your registration fee." (https://venetogravel.it/en/)

**Format Freedom:** "Not being a race, you've got to collect stamps at the checkpoints and there's no big clock timing you as you cross the finish line—hell, there's not even a result's list." No trackers used. (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-veneto-gravel-2023 and https://bolg.gsng.eu/root/2025/04-25--27_veneto-gravel-2025.html)

**Tourism Integration:** "What sets the Veneto Gravel apart from other bikepacking events is its enormous scale" and how "the route opens up a hidden side of Italy, full of little-known tracks and long-forgotten corners." Route designed to showcase region's highlights. (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-veneto-gravel-2023)

**Organizer Ethos:** Founders Roberto Polato and Velia Agostini described as "gravellists for five years who come from the Granfondo scene both on the road and MTB. Both of them always try to do everything to give a good experience to the participants of their events and, above all, they travel the tracks kilometer by kilometer." (https://3t.bike/blogs/news/venetogravel-the-longest-gravel-ride-in-europe)

**Historic Sites As Rest Points:** "You'll always find water, food, and somewhere comfy to sleep" in the historic villages and cities along the route. (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/ride-report-veneto-gravel-2023)
