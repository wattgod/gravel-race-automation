# VERMONT OVERLAND — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Baker Donahue [COMPETITIVE]:** "Vermont has an entirely different style of gravel racing, the name of the game is shorter miles, higher elevation, and gnarlier terrain. The Vermont Overland is no exception, 59 miles, 7,500 ft. of climbing, and 8 class 4 sectors (road that is not maintained by the town or state and can be in various states of disrepair)." (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/race-report-the-vermont-overland)

**Baker Donahue [COMPETITIVE]:** "I got a bad position on the mass start, this was a HUGE corral and as a people pleaser, I kept my distance (300-400 riders back). I quickly caught up to the lead group after ~2 mi, but my effort was much harder than I would have liked... I got sent into the bushes from a rogue root and quickly realized I lost a bottle (shouldn't have skipped cx practice last week)." (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/race-report-the-vermont-overland)

**Baker Donahue [COMPETITIVE]:** "This 'gravel' was by far the wildest I've ever set my tires on, riders were getting sent in all directions and it was awesome... The lost bottle issue hit me in the last 10 miles with calf and thigh cramps, I took a couple more light tumbles, but recovered quickly and managed to press on." Finished P22 overall, 5:36 time approximately. (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/race-report-the-vermont-overland)

**JOM [COMPETITIVE]:** "After a playing of the American National Anthem, Peter fired up the 'Rover, and led the massive throng of riders out of the Suicide Six parking lot in neutral mode... my position in the race would change as soon as the race officially got underway at the first gravel sector. Said sector began ascending immediately, while I (JOM) was dropped immediately, from second row to rear third of the bunch in about two minutes. I thought I might sort of be recovered from D2R2, but obviously not." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/vermont-overland-grand-prix-2015-joms-race-report/)

**JOM [COMPETITIVE]:** "Vermont 'Pavé' is best described as a rocky forest trail. Sections of the 'Pavé' are completely rideable, perhaps totally rideable if you have the skills. But, the early sectors became a logjam for those of us in the grupetto, as people dismounted and trudged up the steep and rocky grades." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/vermont-overland-grand-prix-2015-joms-race-report/)

**Sarah Skelly [UNKNOWN]:** "My first Overland was in 2022... I flailed down several of the class IV roads being bucked the entire way. It wasn't pretty. It wasn't skilled. It was lucky. With my legs and arms cramping and fatigued, I made it across the finish line intact... My time was 5:36:11 which averaged 10.5MPH. I placed 89/219 in the women's overall category." (https://uvcc.bike/articles/vt-overland-measure-personal-progress)

**Sarah Skelly [UNKNOWN]:** "By Overland 2023... I lost all but two gels from my pockets after going down the first class IV section. I was able to pick up some spare gels at the rest stop midway but the sweet, sugary treats had other ideas for my GI tract. I spent the second half of the race under fueled and feeling ill." Time: 4:55:13.6, placing 27/129 women's overall. (https://uvcc.bike/articles/vt-overland-measure-personal-progress)

**Sarah Skelly [UNKNOWN]:** "In 2024... It was shortly into this section that I started realizing the progress I had made on my skills in the last year: I was now the rider who was confident. I had a line, I had control, and I wasn't afraid... What was once so feared, was now just familiar riding." Time: 4:27:00.1, placing 16/111 women's overall and 3rd in age group. (https://uvcc.bike/articles/vt-overland-measure-personal-progress)

**Ian Boswell [ELITE]:** "Unbound is long, Gravel Locos is fast, SBT GRVL is fun, but the Overland is relentless." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/gallery-joy-overload-at-the-vermont-overland/)

**Tim Johnson [ELITE]:** Led a public recon ride the day before the race "covering the first 10 of the route and providing personal insight on tackling the challenging terrain... Johnson provided guidance on topics such as riding steep, technical 'baby head' trails, fast descents and hydration." (https://www.cxmagazine.com/2016-vermont-overland-photos-report-peter-vollers/11)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**JOM [COMPETITIVE]:** Rode a Lynskey Monster CX bike with "a SRAM 1170 11-speed 11-36 unit – the 36 was used all day!" (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/vermont-overland-grand-prix-2015-joms-race-report/)

**From race organizer guidance [UNKNOWN level]:** "The route is predominantly composed of dirt roads, making gravel-specific bikes or cross bikes with a minimum of 32c tires and low gearing ideal choices. A hardtail mountain bike is also a suitable option, especially for those new to dirt road riding. While road bikes are allowed, they might not provide the optimal experience on this demanding terrain." (https://strambecco.com/event/vermont-overland/)

**Course recon observation [UNKNOWN level]:** "Bikes varied from high-volume tire road bikes to true fat bikes." (https://www.cxmagazine.com/2016-vermont-overland-photos-report-peter-vollers/11)

## Weather Experienced

**2022 race conditions:** "I rolled out of my hammock early Saturday morning to 1,300 riders buzzing around the Ascutney Outdoors Ski Center. My night's sleep was pretty brutal with thunderstorms rolling in and out, soaking the course, making for an interesting day of riding." (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/race-report-the-vermont-overland)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Baker Donahue [COMPETITIVE]:** "20 miles in this course had no chill, the class 4 sectors kept thinning the group and the climbs were relentless... I'm a cautious descender and this course was won in the climbs, but I was thankful for lesson after lesson on how to control your bike and find the right line." (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/race-report-the-vermont-overland)

**JOM [COMPETITIVE]:** Described the "Arenberg Forest" sector as a homage to Paris Roubaix. "Between the last aid station and the finish line lay a lot more ascending, and tough 'pavé' sectors... There was also much walking by some on the less technical roads – such was their steepness – and some riders were very under-geared." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/vermont-overland-grand-prix-2015-joms-race-report/)

**JOM [COMPETITIVE]:** "The ending to all of this fun and madness, was a steep descent to Suicide Six – the back way... I bailed halfway through the steepest of the descents (something like 45 degrees) before the finish line." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/vermont-overland-grand-prix-2015-joms-race-report/)

**Sarah Skelly [UNKNOWN]:** On 2024 race: "I arrived at the first class IV section which isn't far into the race. If you are anywhere behind the front pack, this section will be bottlenecked due to sheer volume of racers of various skill levels trying to get through a narrow trail. As soon as one racer falls or has to dismount, the traffic jam ensues." (https://uvcc.bike/articles/vt-overland-measure-personal-progress)

**Sarah Skelly [UNKNOWN]:** "I had a little lull around mile 40 coming up on a series of five identical 0.3 mile climbs at >10% grades." (https://uvcc.bike/articles/vt-overland-measure-personal-progress)

**Course characterization:** "48-mile, 5,700 foot elevation gain course took riders from an astonishing 2.5 hours, if you're Ansel Dickey of Astellas and Brendan Rhim of Holowesko-Citadel, to over four hours, for the majority of riders." (https://www.cxmagazine.com/2016-vermont-overland-photos-report-peter-vollers/11)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Baker Donahue [COMPETITIVE]:** "I had planned for no aid station stops and was loaded with plenty of snacks and two bottles remaining from my early race fumble. We zipped passed the first aid station and I snagged an Untapped pure maple syrup gel from a generous volunteer... this meant skipping the second aid station… I slammed a GU and we continued on." (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/race-report-the-vermont-overland)

**Sarah Skelly [UNKNOWN]:** On 2024 race start positioning: "I made my way towards the front of the pack. The closer to the front I went, the bigger my imposter syndrome feelings grew... And then I saw a couple of girls who I recently raced against and decided to tuck in behind them. I knew they were a bit stronger than me but perhaps for the first time, I felt like I belonged in that crew." (https://uvcc.bike/articles/vt-overland-measure-personal-progress)

**Sarah Skelly [UNKNOWN]:** On navigating the first class IV: "I saw the majority of racers taking an 'easy cut' on a double track section alongside the route so I decided to push ahead towards the muddy rocks fewer people dared to ride. I was able to gain a little more ground but was caught up in the masses at the merge point and came to a stop." (https://uvcc.bike/articles/vt-overland-measure-personal-progress)

**Race format guidance [UNKNOWN level]:** "The event is self-navigated, enhancing the authenticity of the overland adventure. Riders are required to have the route pre-loaded on their GPS devices or carry printed cue sheets." (https://strambecco.com/event/vermont-overland/)

**Aid station strategy [UNKNOWN level]:** "Two aid stations powered by Untapped Maple are strategically placed along the route. However, it's recommended that participants start the ride with all the essentials for self-sufficiency. The aid stations are there to supplement your hydration and fuel needs." (https://strambecco.com/event/vermont-overland/)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Baker Donahue [COMPETITIVE]:** Lost a bottle early in race from crash: "I got sent into the bushes from a rogue root and quickly realized I lost a bottle... The lost bottle issue hit me in the last 10 miles with calf and thigh cramps, I took a couple more light tumbles." (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/race-report-the-vermont-overland)

**Sarah Skelly [UNKNOWN]:** "I lost all but two gels from my pockets after going down the first class IV section" in 2023, leading to significant fueling issues in second half. (https://uvcc.bike/articles/vt-overland-measure-personal-progress)

**JOM [COMPETITIVE]:** Noted concern about being under-geared: "some riders were very under-geared" and "There was also much walking by some on the less technical roads – such was their steepness." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/vermont-overland-grand-prix-2015-joms-race-report/)

**Tragic 2022 incident:** Suleiman "Sule" Kangangi, a 33-year-old professional Kenyan cyclist and Team Amani captain, "died as a result of injuries from a bike crash during the Vermont Overland gravel race on Sunday, August 29 [2022]." Details of the crash were not available. (https://www.outsideonline.com/outdoor-adventure/biking/sule-kangangi-of-team-amani-tragically-dies-at-33/)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Baker Donahue [COMPETITIVE]:** "I am a big fan of the post-race party at these things and The Overland knows how to do it right. After 7 Gatorade's and cheering others on at the finish line, I made my way to the vendor booths filling up on live music, creemee's, turkey sammies, and the signature Overland IPA... I think I am most attracted to this style of racing for the 'it's for anyone' attitude. The Overland truly felt like an inclusive and energetic community supporting the first to the last finisher." (https://www.tobedetermined.cc/journal/race-report-the-vermont-overland)

**Race organizer Ansel Dickey:** "It felt so special to be reminded of the amount joy these kinds of events, and just sport in general brings to people, especially after the tragedy last year [Sule Kangangi's death]. The 'race, ride, or event' does not belong me or anyone in particular – it belongs to the people who have touched it and made it what it has become over the years, and on this 10th year in particular, Sule." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-racing/gallery-joy-overload-at-the-vermont-overland/)

**JOM [COMPETITIVE]:** On aid stations: "Those who missed out on the second aid station stop in Barnard Village missed a real treat. The highlight for me and possibly everyone else who stopped, was the Wood's Bourbon Barrel Maple Syrup. I managed to score two shots of this goodness, but really could have done with a bottle!" (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/vermont-overland-grand-prix-2015-joms-race-report/)

**Race founder background:** "Peter Vollers has been around the block a few times... won the NCCA Collegiate National Championships... After finishing his law degree and setting up shop in Vermont, Vollers continued with his full menu of criteriums and road races, but his appetite for adventure also emerged... the Vermont lawyer started exploring the rugged southern Vermont backroads in a '72 Land Rover, with a mountain bike in tow." (https://www.cxmagazine.com/2016-vermont-overland-photos-report-peter-vollers/11)

**Post-ride scene:** "Once you cross the finish line, the festivities continue after the race with a post-ride party and cookout presented by The Brownsville Butcher & Pantry. Live music, a vibrant expo featuring partners like Specialized Bicycles, SRAM, and more, create an atmosphere of camaraderie and celebration." (https://strambecco.com/event/vermont-overland/)

**Registration dynamics:** "With a field limit of 1,000 participants, this is one of the most popular gravel events in the country, let alone New England. This event sells out within hours – registration opens annually on Jan 1, so it's important to mark your calendar." (https://strambecco.com/event/vermont-overland/)

**Event philosophy:** Vermont Overland organizer states: "Vermont Overland was founded in the belief that all-surface exploration is transformative. Today we still host our flagship event, The Overland (bike) & The Overland (run), along with many other smaller events with the goal of sharing the spirit of adventure while also supporting the local communities of Vermont that make these events possible."
