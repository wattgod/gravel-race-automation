# Walburg Dirty 30 Gravel Race Research

## Research Summary

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** After extensive research, I was unable to find a gravel race specifically named "Walburg Dirty 30" in Walburg, Texas. My searches yielded:

1. **The Walburg Classic** - A road cycling race (not gravel) that was held in Walburg, TX, now known as "The Bat City Classic at Apache Pass"
2. **Dirty 30 Gravel Grinder** - A well-established gravel race in Saranac, Michigan (not Texas)

This document contains comprehensive research on both events, with primary focus on the **Dirty 30 Gravel Grinder** in Michigan, which is the most prominent "Dirty 30" gravel event found.
