# WASATCH ALL-ROAD — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Charlotte Backus [COMPETITIVE]:** "The wall had taken a lot out of me, but I was still cursing. Nutrition- I had all my food with me for the most part, but definitely needed to stock up at the second feed zone for water. This time I started with the SANs meal bars that I have been really enjoying and loving how well they work for me." (https://www.exquisiteendurancecoaching.com/post/wasatch-all-road-race-recap)

**Charlotte Backus [COMPETITIVE]:** "Over the past year, I have been really working on skills and getting comfortable with the big rocks as I come from a road bike background. The Wall It is a wall.. rocky, deep sand, rutty, tall and mighty. It was hard.. a challenge, but I got off only twice this time on sections that were not ridable. I was happy as my skills had greatly improved and I was happy to be back at my nemesis route." (https://www.exquisiteendurancecoaching.com/post/wasatch-all-road-race-recap)

**Charlotte Backus [COMPETITIVE]:** "I really appreciated the views. At this point, I knew I was tired and a selection had been made so I took moments to enjoy the ride as my motto this year was to enjoy and really embrace gravel riding as I stepped my foot into more ultra cycling." (https://www.exquisiteendurancecoaching.com/post/wasatch-all-road-race-recap)

**Reddit user [UNKNOWN]:** "I did the mini-yeti route this morning and found it rewarding but also incredibly difficult. Granted, I've only been in Utah a few weeks, so elevation is not my friend, but the combo of steep grades and technical terrain made for really slow progress... I was on a BMC La Cabra with a big mtb cassette and 2.4 inch tires and I was fishtailing up some of the climbs." (https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/onm9j3/wasatch_allroad/)

**Reddit user [UNKNOWN]:** "This race was absolutely brutal, especially with the 12 miles of climbing at the beginning and all of the rock fields thought out this course. I definitely had to walk the bike a few times down some rocky paths but the new S works pathfinder pros did great and only slipped a few times while climbing but only when it got to a 17 percent grade. Now I'm hooked and can't wait to do another one! Preferably a more flat one 😅." (https://www.reddit.com/r/CanyonBikes/comments/16lbk8e/did_my_first_ever_gravel_race_yesterday_wasatch/)

**Charlotte Backus [COMPETITIVE]:** "With the adrenaline of a race or a workout, I have found that giving yourself a moment to just sit and breathe and think helps. Our fight-or-flight adrenaline is sky high when we do long tough rides, races, and even workouts. It's ok to give yourself time to recollect and breathe to find stability."
