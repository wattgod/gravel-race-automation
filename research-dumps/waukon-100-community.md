# WAUKON 100 — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

The race takes place in the "driftless" region of Iowa, characterized by an unusual topography for the state. According to multiple sources, "Mother nature has created an amazing series of long valleys and steep ridges" in the roads north of Waukon and east of Decorah (https://www.allamakeecounty.com/events/waukon-100-iowa-gravel-series, https://www.cityofwaukon.com/events/waukon-100).

The route explores "all the beauty of the Upper Iowa River and Waterloo river bottoms" (https://www.allamakeecounty.com/events/waukon-100-iowa-gravel-series).

**[COMPETITIVE] rider observation:** "Make no mistake, there's a bit more climbing in Waukon than the Silver City race, but it's absolutely worth it" (https://www.bikeiowa.com/Event/16025/waukon-one-hundred-iowa-gravel-series).

The course is 100km / 62 miles in distance (https://www.bikeiowa.com/Event/16025/waukon-one-hundred-iowa-gravel-series).

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

The race is explicitly positioned as "friendly to both new and experienced racers" and is described as "a ride that you can invite your family or buddy to that's new to gravel grinding or group riding" (https://www.cityofwaukon.com/events/waukon-100).

The organizers emphasize that riders can "know the route will be well marked and the people friendly" (https://www.cityofwaukon.com/events/waukon-100).

The Iowa Gravel Series philosophy is described as "about having a great day in the saddle and riding some of the best roads in Iowa" rather than purely competitive racing (https://www.cityofwaukon.com/events/waukon-100).
