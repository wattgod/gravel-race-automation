# WEST COAST GRAVEL — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Dave Malwitz [UNKNOWN]:** Writing about Mammoth Tuff (different event but similar West Coast gravel scene): "What makes Mammoth Tuff deceivingly difficult is its unique set of challenges: the starting altitude of 8,000 feet, long stretches of sandy and loose terrain, and the near absence of course markings. Riders are well warned to rely on their own navigation rather than following the course blindly." (https://www.gravelstoke.com/gravel-cycling-gear-blog/mammoth-tuff-2024-through-sand-and-sky)

**Dave Malwitz [UNKNOWN]:** "That first year, my buddy Danny and I tackled the TUFFER course—80 miles and 5,000 feet of climbing that, on paper, seemed reasonable. However, the combination of high elevation, loose gravel, and unrelenting wind quickly redefined my sense of 'tuff'." (https://www.gravelstoke.com/gravel-cycling-gear-blog/mammoth-tuff-2024-through-sand-and-sky)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**From Official Event Info [ALL LEVELS]:** "35 MM and, if wet, 38 MM for increased contact area" recommended tire width. The event emphasizes bringing "your 35MM or larger gravel bike or mountain bike." (https://www.mudslingerevents.com/west-coast-gravel)

**Dave Malwitz [UNKNOWN]:** Used Soma Cazadero 700x50 tires at Mammoth Tuff: "The Revel titanium frame does an excellent job at smoothing out rough terrain, while the wider tires helped me float across many sandy sections." Equipment: Revel R+ Titanium with SRAM Force XPLR eTap AXS (42t chainring, 10-44 cassette), Ergon SR Allroad saddle.
