# WHISKEY OFF-ROAD — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Andrea Wilson [COMPETITIVE]:** "The awesome thing about racing the Pro category (other than getting to meet some of my MTB heros on the start line) is that the 44 of us entered were privileged to our own start. Anyone who has ever raced an NUE race (or the Whiskey 50-proof amateur race the day before) can attest to the misery of traffic jams that result when huge numbers of riders of all shapes/sizes/abilities (whether real or perceived) all take off at the same time." (https://www.brickhouseracing.com/?p=6177)

**Andrea Wilson [COMPETITIVE]:** "I got a terrible case of hot foot (I think?) My outer two toes on both feet felt like someone was clamping them into a vice and they were about to explode off of the end of my foot. I was forced to sit. I'd been hanging with Li'l Karen Jarchow for a while, but when the toe thing screwed up my singlespeeder mojo, she dropped me like the 105 pounds of stone cold killer that she is." (https://www.brickhouseracing.com/?p=6177)

**Andrea Wilson [COMPETITIVE]:** "My finish time was 4 hours, 10 minutes. 27th place. Meh-pic! Don't get me wrong- given the all-star nature of the field, I wasn't expecting a top 10 (or even necessarily top 15) finish. I was, however, hoping to be at least in the top half of the finishers." (https://www.brickhouseracing.com/?p=6177)

**Hannah Otto [ELITE]:** "I view Whiskey as a premiere event on the off-road calendar. With a background in mountain biking I've always known of the Whiskey 50 and held it in high regard. I think generally speaking that with the rise of gravel there are simply more events on the calendar than ever before." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/mountain/whiskey-off-road-mountain-bike-race-cuts-through-gravel-craze/)

**Andrew L'Esperance [ELITE]:** "We are at the end of three weeks of a pretty heavy-duty block of racing with the gravel race at Sea Otter and then Levi's Gran Fondo and also being at altitude, yeah we pulled together a pretty solid ride." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/mountain/whiskey-off-road-mountain-bike-race-cuts-through-gravel-craze/)

**Andrew L'Esperance [ELITE]:** "If the goal was to win Whiskey, which is completely reasonable for Sean and I to target, we wouldn't have done Levi's and we would've come right to Prescott after Sea Otter to get a little bit of altitude exposure, and been a little bit fresher. And the win would've been 100% on the table." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/mountain/whiskey-off-road-mountain-bike-race-cuts-through-gravel-craze/)

**Bill Schieken [ELITE race coverage]:** "After the call was made, half the women's field, shivering under shop canopies, waiting out the storm, jumped on their bikes, braved the sideways rain and hail, and did a parade lap to thank the spectators lined up course side, hoping a race would somehow happen." (https://cxhairs.substack.com/p/big-money-prime-shakes-up-whiskey)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Andrea Wilson [COMPETITIVE]:** "At first, the pace remained easier than I thought it would as we negotiated the last of the city streets. However, once the road went to gravel and pitched up steeply, the leaders kicked it up, and the group strung out with me about 3/4 of the way back. I knew the pace I could maintain, and I knew that some of the women ahead of me were going harder than what they should, so I stuck with my effort and soon started to reel them in one at a time." (https://www.brickhouseracing.com/?p=6177)

**Andrea Wilson [COMPETITIVE] — Singlespeed climbing technique:** "I was doing a great job of 'singlespeeding it' by picking a really comfortable gear and standing/using my bodyweight to go faster than I could seated for the same amount of effort (it's a learned skill- if you've never done much singlespeed climbing, you'll find that until you figure it out otherwise, you'll use more energy standing than you do when you sit). Example- if I stand and climb at a heart rate of ~170bpm, I'm going 9mph, whereas, if I sit and spin at ~170bpm, I'm only doing 8 mph." (https://www.brickhouseracing.com/?p=6177)

**2024 Race dynamics [ELITE level] — Impact of $1000 KOM/QOM prime:** "With that $2000 on the table, the Epic Rides brain trust came up with an idea: offer a $1000 prime to the first person in the men's and women's field to make it to the top of the climb just before the left-hand turn into the single track. The winner takes all. This changed everything." The traditional neutral start pace was abandoned as riders went hard from the gun for the cash prime. (https://cxhairs.substack.com/p/big-money-prime-shakes-up-whiskey)

**Toby Hassett [ELITE] — Risk/reward of going for prime:** Hassett "decided to potentially blow up the rest of his race to go head-to-head with two of the fastest mountain bikers in the world" for the $1000 prime. He won it, beating Keegan Swenson and Cole Paton, then "relaxed and began to recover, knowing he still had a lot of miles ahead." (https://cxhairs.substack.com/p/big-money-prime-shakes-up-whiskey)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Andrea Wilson [COMPETITIVE]:** "The course starts with a long climb out of town. It's eerily quiet with the exception of the pockets of crowds that had gathered to cheer us along... once the road went to gravel and pitched up steeply, the leaders kicked it up." (https://www.brickhouseracing.com/?p=6177)

**Andrea Wilson [COMPETITIVE]:** "Once I was up to the overlook where I'd taken photos on Friday, I made the right hand turn and started the descent back down to town. The descending out there was a ton of fun, though once I nearly made contact with a prickly pear cactus bush the size of a smartcar." (https://www.brickhouseracing.com/?p=6177)

**Course start/singletrack pinch point:** "The start of the race is a 3.8-mile climb up Copper Basin Road... Once the road turns to dirt, you climb for about another mile and then take a hard left turn onto the single track. In years past, the real racing starts as this left turn pinch point gets close. You want to be in the top 10 or 15 entering the single track, or you'll play catch-up all day." (https://cxhairs.substack.com/p/big-money-prime-shakes-up-whiskey)

**50 Proof Course:** 46.2 miles with over 6000 feet of climbing, described as having "technical singletrack, sick descents" and "tight racing in the pro ranks." The course historically has a 94% finish rate. (https://cxhairs.substack.com/p/big-money-prime-shakes-up-whiskey, https://strambecco.com/event/whiskey-off-road/)

**Skull Valley climb:** The "long dirt road climb out of Skull Valley" was specifically mentioned as a difficulty point where Andrea Wilson experienced foot pain issues. (https://www.brickhouseracing.com/?p=6177)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Andrea Wilson [COMPETITIVE] — Hot foot issues:** "I got a terrible case of hot foot (I think?) My outer two toes on both feet felt like someone was clamping them into a vice and they were about to explode off of the end of my foot. I was forced to sit" during the Skull Valley climb, causing her to lose positions. (https://www.brickhouseracing.com/?p=6177)

**Altitude impact [COMPETITIVE level]:** Andrea Wilson noted: "The altitude had a little bit to do with it. It was day #3 at ~5300ft, so it would explain why I'd felt like a rockstar on Friday but maybe a little blunted on Sunday." Race is held at approximately 5,300-5,800ft elevation. (https://www.brickhouseracing.com/?p=6177)

## Performance Weaknesses Identified

**Andrea Wilson [COMPETITIVE] — Self-assessment:** "I have to go downhill faster. That's a tough one to work on in Memphis because the hills here are short. Descending at 20mph is what feels 'normal' to me. When I get to where the descents are longer and faster, it feels crazy- I'm just not accustomed to the speed." She noted she can adapt with practice, as shown at Breck Epic. (https://www.brickhouseracing.com/?p=6177)

## Weather Experienced

**2024 Friday Fat Tire Crit — Canceled due to storm:** "Friday, April 26, in Prescott was beautiful. It was a little cool but sunny and pleasant. However, if you looked at the radar, you could see a storm coming... the temperature dropped about 20 degrees to somewhere in the 30s, and the rain started... It poured, it hailed, and organizers pushed back the race start." The storm made the course (with "several road sections of bricks, painted crosswalks, and high-speed turns on a screaming fast descent") unsafe, leading to cancelation. "Thirty minutes after Epic Rides canceled the race... It was sunny and beautiful. Perfect racing conditions." (https://cxhairs.substack.com/p/big-money-prime-shakes-up-whiskey)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Todd Sadow (Race Director) on what makes Whiskey special:** "We're not Life Time, we're not Ironman, but we put on events that draw a similar audience in size. However we see our events differently and more rooted in community." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/mountain/whiskey-off-road-mountain-bike-race-cuts-through-gravel-craze/)

**Race weekend vibe:** "Over three days, participants are immersed in an atmosphere buzzing with mountain bike culture, surrounded by fellow biking aficionados." The event features a community concert, beer garden sponsored by local breweries, and finishes on Prescott's historic Whiskey Row. (https://strambecco.com/event/whiskey-off-road/)

**Pro field separation from amateur start chaos:** The Pro category gets its own start, avoiding "the misery of traffic jams that result when huge numbers of riders of all shapes/sizes/abilities (whether real or perceived) all take off at the same time" as happens in the amateur race. (https://www.brickhouseracing.com/?p=6177)

**Fat Tire Crit atmosphere (pre-cancelation):** "The controlled chaos of the Fat Tire Crit gets me stoked to return to Prescott every year. And I know many pro racers feel the same way... On paper, racing a criterium on straight bar mountain bikes with competitors who don't spend a lot of time pack racing on the road seems a bit sketchy. But in the four or five editions of this race I've covered, I have never seen a crash in this race." (https://cxhairs.substack.com/p/big-money-prime-shakes-up-whiskey)

**Post-amateur race scene:** "Squint your eyes on Saturday after the amateur race has finished, and it looks an awful lot like the biggest, most celebrated gravel events. Hundreds of people, tired but happy, kicking it with new and old friends in the center of a small American town with bikes strewn around far and wide." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/mountain/whiskey-off-road-mountain-bike-race-cuts-through-gravel-craze/)

**Why riders return year after year:** "A race like Whiskey is one you wish to return to year after year... It's a race you can come to for the killer course and downtown festival atmosphere rather than something you just want to finish." (https://cxhairs.substack.com/p/big-money-prime-shakes-up-whiskey)

## Event History & Context

**Todd Sadow (Race Director) on event origins:** Race director Todd Sadow is 48 years old and started putting on bike races 27 years ago with the 24 Hours of Old Pueblo, graduating from University of Arizona at age 21. Whiskey Off-Road is now in its 20th year (as of 2025). "The Whiskey Off-Road showed me and my team a model that we could scale because mountain biking had suffered nationally for a while. We spent five years creating what is known as the Whiskey Off-Road today building that model and then we launched an event in Grand Junction, we launched an event in Carson City and we launched another one in Bentonville." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/mountain/whiskey-off-road-mountain-bike-race-cuts-through-gravel-craze/)

**COVID impact:** "When Covid hit it made the most sense for us to just step back from our expansion events given that we had no idea what lay ahead for the cycling industry in 2020 and 2021. We wanted to be nimble and strong instead of the threshold trying to lift up a whole industry nationally." (https://velo.outsideonline.com/mountain/whiskey-off-road-mountain-bike-race-cuts-through-gravel-craze/)

**Keegan Swenson's dominance:** Keegan Swenson won his fifth consecutive Whiskey Off-Road title in 2024. (https://cxhairs.substack.com/p/big-money-prime-shakes-up-whiskey)
