# WILD GRAVEL — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**AusCycling License Requirement:** The 100km and 150km race distances are AusCycling-sanctioned events, requiring either an active AusCycling license or a $10 day license purchased at registration. Shorter distances (12km, 30km, 60km) do not require a license. (gnowangerup.wa.gov.au)

**Tire and Surface Notes:** The course runs primarily on gravel roads through the Stirling Ranges, including Stirling Range Drive and Red Gum Pass Road (both closed to traffic for the event). No rooty singletrack or technical trail passages have been reported, suggesting standard gravel tires in the 38-42mm range should be adequate. (wildgravel.com.au)

## Weather Experienced

**October Conditions:** The event takes place in mid-October (spring in the Southern Hemisphere), coinciding with the Stirling Ranges' famous wildflower season. No specific temperature or wind data has been reported from past editions, though spring weather in the Great Southern region of Western Australia is generally mild with occasional rain. (gnowangerup.wa.gov.au)

**No Major Weather Incidents:** The 2024 debut edition had no reported weather-related disruptions. (wildgravel.com.au)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Course Distances:** Wild Gravel offers gravel rides of 12km, 30km, 60km, 100km, and 150km, plus gravel runs (5km, 12km, half marathon, marathon) and run+ride duathlon options. The 150km ride includes an open-road section beyond the national park. (gnowangerup.wa.gov.au)

**Elevation:** The course features undulating terrain with significant climbs through the iconic Stirling Ranges. The marathon run (42.2km) accumulates 853m of elevation gain and is rated maximum difficulty. Ride elevation profiles have not been published in detail, though the 60km ride is estimated at approximately 1067m (3500 ft) of climbing. (wildgravel.com.au)

**Landscape:** Routes traverse the rugged Stirling Range National Park, known for dramatic peaks, endemic wildflowers, and wildlife. The terrain is described as challenging but entirely rideable on gravel bikes. (gnowangerup.wa.gov.au)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

No pacing data or strategy reports are available from participants. The 42.2km run has a 6-hour time limit, suggesting the terrain is demanding. The 100km and 150km AusCycling-sanctioned races attract competitive fields, but no power or speed data has been shared publicly.

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Event Philosophy:** Wild Gravel is organized by the **Shire of Gnowangerup** as a community-focused multi-sport event. The weekend includes a support event, **Gnowangerup Community Gravel**, held the day before (Friday) with family-friendly activities including food, live music, learn-to-ride gravel sessions, and warm-up rides and runs. (gnowangerup.wa.gov.au)

**Regional Significance:** Wild Gravel is marketed as "WA's most spectacular gravel event" and is part of Western Australia's growing gravel scene alongside events like Seven and Backroads. The Gnowangerup Community Gravel was selected as a major regional event for the 2025 WA Bike Month. (wildgravel.com.au)

**Multi-Sport Format:** With 15 challenges spanning rides, runs, walks, and duathlons, the event is designed to attract a broad range of participants beyond dedicated cyclists. (gnowangerup.wa.gov.au)

**Wild Gravel Trail:** The event has inspired a self-guided 440km gravel loop connecting 8 towns in the region, providing a year-round gravel touring option. (wildgravel.com.au)

## Logistics

**Location:** All routes start and finish at the AFGRI Event Village, located 7km west of Chester Pass Road on Stirling Range Drive, in the Stirling Ranges. (gnowangerup.wa.gov.au)

**Travel:** The nearest major airport is Perth (approximately 340km). Albany airport is closer at approximately 140km. (wildgravel.com.au)

**Accommodation:** The surrounding Shire of Gnowangerup offers limited lodging; camping and accommodation in nearby towns along the Wild Gravel Trail loop are options. No event-specific accommodation partnerships have been announced. (gnowangerup.wa.gov.au)
