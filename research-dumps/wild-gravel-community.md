# WILD GRAVEL — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Source URLs

None of the provided sources contain information about a "Wild Gravel" cycling race.

**ANALYSIS:**

The three sources provided are:
1. An e-commerce website for "Wild" brand natural deodorants and body care products
2. An IMDb page for the 2014 film "Wild" starring Reese Witherspoon about hiking the Pacific Crest Trail
3. A Substack article about categorizing gravel races in general (does not mention "Wild Gravel" specifically)

None of these sources contain any information about a gravel cycling race called "Wild Gravel." The sources appear to be unrelated results from a web search that picked up the word "Wild" but do not pertain to the cycling event in question.

To provide a proper community research dump for Wild Gravel, I would need sources that actually discuss that specific race — such as race reports, forum discussions, or blog posts from riders who have participated in Wild Gravel.
