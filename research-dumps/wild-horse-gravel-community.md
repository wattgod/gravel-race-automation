# WILD HORSE GRAVEL — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Jack Luke [ELITE]:** "I didn't want the trip to ever end... I have never ridden through a more impressive landscape and it took great concentration to avoid veering off the road as I gawped at the grandeur of it all." Describing the overall Colorado experience including Wild Horse Gravel. (https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/roll-massif-wild-horse-gravel)

**Jack Luke [ELITE]:** "I knew that I'd have a much more pleasant day out on the short route but, giving into imagined peer pressure and my fragile ego, I opted for the long ride... I gave it all I could on this section and somehow stuck with the front group — somewhere a full-time excuse-maker like me does not belong — most of the way through until I blew up on the very last climb. Thoroughly cooked, and with 97km still to go..." (https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/roll-massif-wild-horse-gravel)

**Jack Luke [ELITE]:** "The beating hot sun definitely took its toll on my pasty white complexion along this section and I was chugging away more water than probably necessary. The segment wasn't a total disaster though, and after eating all the food I could at the penultimate stop (more M&M-filled bananas!), I pushed on through the final climb and had just enough in me to not walk up the final steep section." (https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/roll-massif-wild-horse-gravel)

**JOM [ELITE]:** "I don't know her name, but the rider pictured above was setting an excellent tempo that I could maintain, until the extremely steep climb to the end of the KOM / QOM segment... Thankfully, I didn't embarrass myself too badly and finished in 75th spot of 171 blokes who began the event." On the first timed segment.

**JOM [ELITE]:** "The only serious element of Wild Horse Gravel was the tricky nature of some of the descents. They were steep and rutted, and considering there was no time clock running between segments, it was a futile exercise to hammer them with unnecessary risk-taking." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/ride-report-wild-horse-gravel-de-beque-colorado-lets-roll-with-roll-massif/)

**JOM [ELITE]:** "Grinduro format racing, if you want to call it a race, is less than serious. This was abundantly clear from some of the riders I spoke to the morning of the ride. Riding in the company of friends and snapping photos was of a higher priority, in addition to enjoying the virtually vehicle-free gravel roads." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/ride-report-wild-horse-gravel-de-beque-colorado-lets-roll-with-roll-massif/)

**Ben Delaney [ELITE]:** Organized and participated in the event as Roll Massif frontman. Noted that the first mile or so was neutralized and led out briefly by a horseback rider. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/ride-report-wild-horse-gravel-de-beque-colorado-lets-roll-with-roll-massif/)

**Connor Mullervy [ELITE]:** Won the men's first KOM/QOM segment in 25:18. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/ride-report-wild-horse-gravel-de-beque-colorado-lets-roll-with-roll-massif/)

**Kristen Legan [ELITE]:** Won the women's first KOM/QOM segment in 28:42. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/ride-report-wild-horse-gravel-de-beque-colorado-lets-roll-with-roll-massif/)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Jack Luke [ELITE]:** Rode a Specialized Diverge Pro with Shimano Ultegra Di2, using 38mm-wide Sawtooth tyres for Friday's Colorado National Monument ride. Noted: "I was delighted to have the chunky 38mm-wide Sawtooth tyres on the rather treacherous and freezing cold descent." (https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/roll-massif-wild-horse-gravel)

**Jack Luke [ELITE]:** Switched to Mavic's all-new Allroad Pro Carbon SL wheels with 40mm Yksion Allroad tyres for Wild Horse Gravel Saturday race. (https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/roll-massif-wild-horse-gravel)

**JOM [ELITE]:** "My loaner bike was kitted out with a 48/32 chainring pairing and an 11-32 cassette, perfect for much of the course, except the really steep stuff, which is when a less than 1 to 1 ratio comes in handy." Rode a Specialized Diverge Pro with Mavic Ksyrium Pro Carbon SL UST disc wheels for part of the trip, then Mavic Allroad Pro Carbon SL wheels for the race. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/ride-report-wild-horse-gravel-de-beque-colorado-lets-roll-with-roll-massif/)

**Official Course Recommendation [ELITE/COMPETITIVE]:** For the Mustang 65-mile course: "Tire Width: 40–45mm gravel tires with puncture resistance; Gearing: Sub-compact or gravel-specific gearing highly recommended (minimum 1:1 ratio for climbing comfort); Hydration: Carry at least 2L water capacity between aid stations." (https://geminiadventures.com/bike/wild-horse-gravel)

## Weather Experienced

**2019 conditions:** Jack Luke experienced snow during a pre-race Thursday ride up Flagstaff near Boulder: "Ensuring I'd get the full Colorado experience, a big dump of snow arrived overnight, freshening conditions and keeping me alert on the slippery corners on the way back down." However, for Wild Horse Gravel on Saturday: "The temperature was brisk in the low 50's Fahrenheit, but the sun's rays would warm the day to the low 70's Fahrenheit and barely a cloud in the sky, absolutely perfect conditions." (https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/roll-massif-wild-horse-gravel and https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/ride-report-wild-horse-gravel-de-beque-colorado-lets-roll-with-roll-massif/)

**Dust conditions (2019):** JOM reported: "The last 5-or-so kilometres into De Beque were spent behind a large semi (aren't I clever not calling it a lorry?) that kicked up an impressive cloud of dust. Growing up in the decidedly dreich Scottish Highlands, riding in dusty conditions is an unknown quantity to me and I rode with my mouth agape before realising that ingesting that much earth was probably a bad idea."

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Mustang Long Course (65 miles, ~5,500 ft climbing):**

**Miles 0-10:** "A 10 mile neutral roll out takes you on a gradual warm-up along well-maintained ranch roads. Rolling terrain with a few quick descents as you ease into the day." (https://geminiadventures.com/bike/wild-horse-gravel)

**Miles 10-22:** "The primary climb begins. Expect a sustained ascent of nearly 1,000 feet over 12 miles. The grade averages 5–6% with punchy sections up to 10%, over rough and often loose gravel." (https://geminiadventures.com/bike/wild-horse-gravel)

**Miles 22-25:** "Fast, some rutted downhills with sweeping switchbacks, use caution, especially in dry conditions when the surface can be marbly." (https://geminiadventures.com/bike/wild-horse-gravel)

**Miles 45-55:** "Expect rougher surface conditions here, including sandy stretches and washboard... Steady climbing resumes through a mix of sun-exposed jeep roads and shaded forest doubletrack and soon turns steep. Wildlife sightings are common here... Expect an uphill grind with some possible walking toward the top." (https://geminiadventures.com/bike/wild-horse-gravel)

**Miles 55-65:** "A thrilling and technical descent back to the valley. Expect loose corners and fast straightaways. The last few miles transition back to smoother gravel and hardpack, perfect for a strong finish into Basecamp." (https://geminiadventures.com/bike/wild-horse-gravel)

**Surface composition:** "85% gravel/dirt roads, 10% doubletrack, 5% paved" for the Mustang course. (https://geminiadventures.com/bike/wild-horse-gravel)

**Jack Luke [ELITE]:** "The following 40km was a blur of wild descents, punchy climbs and some of the most impressive landscapes I have ever ridden." (https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/roll-massif-wild-horse-gravel)

**Exclusivity:** Multiple sources note that the High Lonesome Ranch roads are only open to the public during this event. "The High Lonesome Ranch opens its rugged dirt roads only for this event, giving participants rare access to some of the best-hidden wild-west gravel." (https://geminiadventures.com/bike/wild-horse-gravel)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**JOM [ELITE]:** "Mile zero to five was effectively a warmup for the first timed KOM / QOM segment, which was entirely uphill. I certainly wasn't going to set any record times, but I did select one or two riders as carrots to pace from." Used other riders as pacing targets during the first timed segment. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/ride-report-wild-horse-gravel-de-beque-colorado-lets-roll-with-roll-massif/)

**Jack Luke [ELITE]:** "I gave it all I could on this section and somehow stuck with the front group... most of the way through until I blew up on the very last climb. Thoroughly cooked, and with 97km still to go..." Warning about going too hard on the first timed segment. (https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/roll-massif-wild-horse-gravel)

**Aid station strategy:** Both elite riders reported spending significant time at aid stations. JOM: "If there was a category for sheer time wasted at aid stations, I was hoping to podium. I used my down time to capture video and still photos." Jack Luke enjoyed "M&M-stuffed bananas (they're as good as they sound)" and noted eating "more M&M-filled bananas!" at the penultimate stop. (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/ride-report-wild-horse-gravel-de-beque-colorado-lets-roll-with-roll-massif/ and https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/roll-massif-wild-horse-gravel)

**Descent pacing:** JOM [ELITE] noted: "The only serious element of Wild Horse Gravel was the tricky nature of some of the descents. They were steep and rutted, and considering there was no time clock running between segments, it was a futile exercise to hammer them with unnecessary risk-taking." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/ride-report-wild-horse-gravel-de-beque-colorado-lets-roll-with-roll-massif/)

**Aid stations (Mustang course):** Three fully stocked aid stations at miles 25, 40, and 49, with water, electrolyte mix, bananas, gels, light snacks, PB&Js, and fruit. (https://geminiadventures.com/bike/wild-horse-gravel)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**JOM [ELITE]:** "Grinduro format racing, if you want to call it a race, is less than serious... Riding in the company of friends and snapping photos was of a higher priority, in addition to enjoying the virtually vehicle-free gravel roads." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/ride-report-wild-horse-gravel-de-beque-colorado-lets-roll-with-roll-massif/)

**Regrouping culture:** JOM noted: "Positioned just after the KOM / QOM was a water stop that served as a regrouping point for every rider who'd just finished the segment." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/ride-report-wild-horse-gravel-de-beque-colorado-lets-roll-with-roll-massif/)

**Tandem participation:** JOM observed: "A particular highlight of this section was watching Lisa and Vincent Davis, a highly competent and utterly mad tandem crew, smash through the descents at a truly remarkable pace." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/ride-report-wild-horse-gravel-de-beque-colorado-lets-roll-with-roll-massif/)

**Weekend festival atmosphere:** Event description notes "a full-blown Wild West weekend... country cookout, campfires, live local music, and camping accommodations... it's a hoedown you don't want to miss!" Saturday night includes "Live Music, Food Trucks, Camp Trivia, Glowstick Bonfire/S'mores and Prizes." (https://geminiadventures.com/bike/wild-horse-gravel)

**Pre-race activities:** Friday evening features a 6:00 PM casual group pre-ride from DeBeque Community Center, approximately one hour in length, giving "a nice sampling of what to expect for the event on Saturday." (https://geminiadventures.com/bike/wild-horse-gravel)

**Neutralized start:** Ben Delaney noted "the first mile or so was neutralized and led out briefly by a horseback rider, before everyone was turned loose. Even then, the pace was extremely civilized." (https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/ride-report-wild-horse-gravel-de-beque-colorado-lets-roll-with-roll-massif/)
