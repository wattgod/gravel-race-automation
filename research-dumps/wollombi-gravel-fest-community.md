## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Bike type [UNKNOWN - from organizers]:**
- "The course is definitely a gravel bike course. It can also be ridden on a mountain bike. A road bike would not suffice in certain parts of the course particularly if the weather turns sour."
(https://wollombigravel.com.au/wollombi-gravel-fest/)

**Required spares kit [UNKNOWN - from organizers]:**
"The spares kit on your bike should include a spare tube and tyre levers plus a chain joiner link and a tube/tyre patch kit. You'll also need a multi-tool and if you run tubeless then carry some plugs and a CO2 kit or a pump. If you use AXS then a spare battery is a good idea."
(https://wollombigravel.com.au/wollombi-gravel-fest/)

**Additional recommendations [UNKNOWN - from organizers]:**
- Proper bike clothing
- Sunscreen (noted: "It'll be hot")
- Plenty of water and electrolytes
- Any necessary medication ("we are half an hour from the nearest chemist")
