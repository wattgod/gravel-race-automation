# WÖRTHERSEE GRAVEL RACE — COMMUNITY RESEARCH

## Rider Quotes & Race Reports

**Justyna Jarczok [ELITE]:** "Veni, vidi, vici" — won qualification for the UCI Gravel World Championships at the 2025 event. (https://magazinebike.com/2025/04/17/veni-vidi-vici-qualification-won-worthersee-gravel-race-2025/)

**Magnus Look Claris [ELITE]:** "The region is beautiful. I love the area and the mountains. The course was demanding but selective - that's what I like. I'm glad I managed to win." Won the elite men's race in 3:38:16. (https://magazinebike.com/2025/04/17/veni-vidi-vici-qualification-won-worthersee-gravel-race-2025/)

**Caroline Schiff [ELITE]:** Stated in her podcast AUTSAID that Wörthersee was "the best-organized gravel race in Europe that she had ever taken part in" after the 2024 premiere. (https://ucigravelworldseries.com/en/veldamworthersee/)

**Thomas Terbeck [UNKNOWN]:** "Das wird ein schnelles Rennen werden" (This will be a fast race) — his thought during the recon ride. Described the race as "Highspeed-Gravel" with brutal tempo. Set a goal of under 3 hours for the 83km Catch Gralf distance. During the race: "Was zum…wie soll ich das bloß durchhalten?" (What the...how am I supposed to keep this up?) when seeing 50+ km/h speeds early in the race. Described dust sections as "Ist ja wie bei der Strade Bianchi" (It's just like Strade Bianche). (https://www.bike-x.de/mitgefahren-rasantes-woerthersee-gravel-race/)

**Hannes [UNKNOWN]:** Explained he returned for a second year because "Es hat ihm einfach dermaßen Spaß gemacht" (It was simply so much fun) — "Das Leuchten in seinen Augen" (the shine in his eyes) was evident in his voice. Demonstrated great sportsmanship by offering his wheel after being dropped on a climb. (https://www.bike-x.de/mitgefahren-rasantes-woerthersee-gravel-race/)

**Unnamed MTB racer [UNKNOWN]:** "Turns out I'm not only bad at pushing up short climb after short climb, I'm also bad at keeping backwheels. 🙃 I somehow intuitively stop two meters before I'm actually there because I think I'm already there. I suppose it is because in mountainbike races it most of the time makes sense to keep a bit of distance because there's not much wind and the track bumpy." Found the track "basically a roadbike track. At least from a mountainbikers perspective. It was mostly asphalt or pretty smooth gravel." Concluded: "flat gravel courses are not for me...I just don't have the power to sprint out of every corner. Additionally I don't have enough road race experience to move around smoothly in peletons." (https://trailstories.net/2024/05/20/woerthersee-gravel-race)

**Paco Wrolich [ELITE/UNKNOWN - Ex-Pro leading recon]:** Led pre-race reconnaissance rides showing key sections. Emphasized that "Früh in einer guten Position zu sein, ist entscheidend" (Being in a good position early is crucial) because overtaking on narrow paths is difficult. (https://www.bike-x.de/mitgefahren-rasantes-woerthersee-gravel-race/)

## Equipment & Gear Recommendations

**Thomas Terbeck [UNKNOWN]:** Rode an Avona Callis carbon gravelbike with SRAM Force AXS, DT Swiss GRC 1400 wheels, and **Hutchinson Caracal Race 40mm tires**. Noted the bike "fährt sich mit den Hutchinson Caracal Race-Reifen richtig flink" (rides really nimbly with the Hutchinson Caracal Race tires). Used a Faserwerk Luftschneider handlebar. (https://www.bike-x.de/mitgefahren-rasantes-woerthersee-gravel-race/)

**General observations [UNKNOWN]:** During the race start, Thomas noted "Interessant ist auch das Material der Teilnehmer" (The participants' equipment is also interesting). Many bikes were "blitzblank geputzte Bikes. Die Ausstattungen mehr High-Cost als Low-Budget" (sparkling clean bikes. The equipment more high-cost than low-budget). Tire choice varied significantly: "Zwar gibt es viele, die mit MTB-Kassette unterwegs sind, jedoch viele Bikes auch mit weniger bergtauglicher Übersetzung" (While there are many riding with MTB cassettes, many bikes also had less mountain-suitable gearing). (https://www.bike-x.de/mitgefahren-rasantes-woerthersee-gravel-race/)

**Bottle cage note [UNKNOWN]:** "Unzählige Trinkflaschen haben sich an diesen Stellen aus den Flaschenhalterungen der Teilnehmer verabschiedet" (Countless water bottles ejected from participants' bottle cages) on the rough descents, becoming hazards on course. (https://www.bike-x.de/mitgefahren-rasantes-woerthersee-gravel-race/)

## Weather Experienced

**2025 Race Day:** "Blauer Himmel, Sonnenschein, das Thermometer zeigt knackig kalte sechs Grad an, dazu weht ein äußerst kalter Ostwind" (Blue sky, sunshine, thermometer shows crisp cold 6 degrees Celsius, plus an extremely cold east wind blowing). One older rider at the start "schlottert vor Kälte" (was shivering with cold) before the race began. Thomas noted: "Mir ist jetzt bereits warm" (I'm already warm now) shortly after starting despite the cold. (https://www.bike-x.de/mitgefahren-rasantes-woerthersee-gravel-race/)

**Pre-race conditions:** Two days before the 2025 race during recon, despite recent dry days, there was "noch etwas Matsch zu finden" (still some mud to be found) on paths. (https://www.bike-x.de/mitgefahren-rasantes-woerthersee-gravel-race/)

**Race day surface:** "Der Matsch ist tiefer als beim Recon, der sich durch all die Teilnehmer der vorherigen Starter deutlich vertieft hat" (The mud is deeper than during recon, significantly deepened by all the participants from earlier start waves). Dust became a major factor: "Hier, wo die Sonne seit Tagen fröhlich ihre Strahlen auf die Feldwege wirft, sind wir plötzlich komplett in Staub gehüllt" (Here, where the sun has been cheerfully shining on the field paths for days, we're suddenly completely enveloped in dust). (https://www.bike-x.de/mitgefahren-rasantes-woerthersee-gravel-race/)

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Course profile:** 83km distance has 1000m elevation; 136km distance has 1478m elevation. Each lap features 740m of climbing. Start/finish at lake level (450m above sea level), highest point at 620m after 20km into each lap. (https://ucigravelworldseries.com/en/veldamworthersee/)

**Opening sections [UNKNOWN]:** "Mit ordentlich Schuss geht es die Straße hinunter und rechts ab auf den ersten Gravelpfad" (With considerable speed down the road and right onto the first gravel path). Early gravel sections are "Schmale Pfade mit einem leicht welligen Auf und Ab" (Narrow paths with a slightly undulating up and down). "Vollgas ist die einzige Option" (Full throttle is the only option) through mud sections. (https://www.bike-x.de/mitgefahren-rasantes-woerthersee-gravel-race/)

**Key climb [UNKNOWN]:** "Der erste echte Anstieg, der es mit zwei Kilometern und teils 18 Prozent an der steilsten Stelle in sich hat. Dicke, lose Steine erschweren das Fahren" (The first real climb, 2 kilometers with up to 18 percent at the steepest point. Thick, loose stones make riding difficult). Right side is better for riding "wenn keiner stürzt" (if nobody crashes). "Auf diesem Abschnitt dürfte sich die Spreu vom Weizen trennen" (This section should separate the wheat from the chaff). Riders heard "schweres Atmen" and "Röcheln" (heavy breathing and wheezing) on this climb. (https://www.bike-x.de/mitgefahren-rasantes-woerthersee-gravel-race/)

**Critical bottleneck [UNKNOWN]:** "Eine schmale Fußgängerbrücke mit enger Kurve samt Geländer. Wenn hier ein großer Pulk gleichzeitig ankommt, wird es brenzlig – und das Feld reißt auseinander" (A narrow pedestrian bridge with a tight curve and railing. When a large group arrives here simultaneously, it gets dicey – and the field breaks apart). (https://www.bike-x.de/mitgefahren-rasantes-woerthersee-gravel-race/)

**Technical sections [UNKNOWN]:** "Im rasanten Tempo geht es durch den Wald. Links, rechts, links – zackige Lenkmanöver sind gefordert" (At rapid pace through the forest. Left, right, left – sharp steering maneuvers required). Followed by descents onto "Schlagloch-Feldweg" (pothole field paths). (https://www.bike-x.de/mitgefahren-rasantes-woerthersee-gravel-race/)

**Flat sections [UNKNOWN]:** Field and forest paths alternate. Fast sections along the Drau river with "noch schneebedeckten Berge im Hintergrund" (still snow-covered mountains in the background). Exposed to wind: "Gegenwind? Mitten in die Visage des Protagonisten" (Headwind? Right in the protagonist's face). "Wer hier das Hinterrad des Vordermanns verliert, haut die Körner salvenartig raus" (Whoever loses the front rider's wheel here hemorrhages energy). (https://www.bike-x.de/mitgefahren-rasantes-woerthersee-gravel-race/)

**Feed zone placement [UNKNOWN]:** "Auf dem Loop, der bei den 83 Kilometern zweimal befahren werden muss, befindet sich auf einem Hügel eine Versorgungsstation" (On the loop that must be ridden twice for 83km, there's a feed station on a hill). "Der Schotterweg hinauf ist ein hinterhältiger Gegenspieler. Der kleine Anstieg sieht nach wenig aus, jede Pedalumdrehung auf losem Geröll ist jedoch eine echte Tortur" (The gravel path up is a treacherous opponent. The small climb looks like nothing, but every pedal stroke on loose gravel is real torture). Great spectator support here with "Zuschauer in Liegestühlen auf der Wiese" (spectators in deck chairs on the lawn). (https://www.bike-x.de/mitgefahren-rasantes-woerthersee-gravel-race/)

**Surface assessment [UNKNOWN - MTB perspective]:** "The track is basically a roadbike track. At least from a mountainbikers perspective. It was mostly asphalt or pretty smooth gravel. Only the long climb was a bit bumpy and partly wet." (https://trailstories.net/2024/05/20/woerthersee-gravel-race)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Start positioning [UNKNOWN]:** "Mein Wunsch: Ich möchte mich von Beginn an möglichst weit vorn im Feld aufhalten" (My wish: I want to stay as far forward in the field as possible from the start). "Ich fokussiere mich, gebe Gas, halte mich an den Hinterrädern derjenigen, die weiter nach vorn kommen möchten" (I focus, give gas, hold onto the wheels of those who want to move forward). This proved crucial as "Überholen ist hier schwierig" (overtaking is difficult here) on narrow early paths. (https://www.bike-x.de/mitgefahren-rasantes-woerthersee-gravel-race/)

**Pace reality [UNKNOWN]:** Thomas was shocked by early speeds: "Ich zucke zusammen, als ich auf den Radcomputer blicke und eine 5 vorn stehen sehe" (I flinch when I look at the bike computer and see a 5 in front [50+ km/h]). The tempo was "brutal." Later: "Ich hechle mit 40 km/h einfach nur hinterher" (I'm simply panting along at 40 km/h trying to catch up). "Abschnitte zum Verschnaufen? Fehlanzeige" (Sections to catch your breath? None). (https://www.bike-x.de/mitgefahren-rasantes-woerthersee-gravel-race/)

**Group dynamics [UNKNOWN - MTB racer]:** "In the first lap...I tried to follow a group but either the group was much too fast for me or way too slow. I could stay with others only for minutes." Second lap was most fun: "I found a group of four I joined that worked for all of us. We were changing the front about every minute and we were catching and overtaking other riders." Interestingly noted: "I was the only man in this group. I had the feeling that the women did ride with less ego then the men. They more tried to keep groups intact and use them to their advantage. Men always tried to be in the front or faster than the ones around them." Third lap was solo survival: "By now the race was very split up. Only very small groups if any where riding together." (https://trailstories.net/2024/05/20/woerthersee-gravel-race)

**Starting waves:** Women start at 09:00, men at 09:30 for the UCI race (Beat Gralf). Catch Gralf starts around 09:55. Age groups 35-44 started together in a "huge group" creating early chaos. (https://www.woerthersee-gravel.com/en/program/ and https://trailstories.net/2024/05/20/woerthersee-gravel-race)

**Sportsmanship moment [UNKNOWN]:** After the brutal main climb, rider Hannes "setzt sich zur Revanche in der Ebene, auf der Straße, vor mich und bietet mir seinen Windschatten an. Großartiger Sportsgeist" (positioned himself on the flat road section in front of me and offered his draft. Great sportsmanship). They traded pulls and chatted briefly. (https://www.bike-x.de/mitgefahren-rasantes-woerthersee-gravel-race/)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Fueling mistakes [UNKNOWN - MTB racer]:** "My fueling strategy is still not dialed in. I had 2.5 liters of Maurten Hydrogel with me, no water at all. That was a mistake...There were three aid stations on the lap. At each I took a small water cup. But that also was not enough. In the second lap I stopped quickly to fill one of my 0.7 liter bottles with water. But it was empty again way too soon." Concluded: "On races this long I will not be able to bring everything I need with me from the start." Recommends starting with one 0.7L bottle of water and refilling at aid stations. (https://trailstories.net/2024/05/20/woerthersee-gravel-race)

**Position losses [UNKNOWN]:** Small mistakes cost dearly. Thomas lost his group when "der Fahrer zu meiner Linken bekommt die Kurve nicht und muss auf die Wiese geradeaus. Somit komme ich ebenfalls nicht um die Kurve. Ich verliere den Anschluss. Die maximal zehn Sekunden Verlust bekomme ich nicht mehr zugefahren" (the rider to my left couldn't make the corner and had to go straight onto the grass. So I also couldn't make the corner. I lose contact. I can't close the gap of at most ten seconds). (https://www.bike-x.de/mitgefahren-rasantes-woerthersee-gravel-race/)

**Mechanical hazards:** Numerous bottles ejected from cages on rough sections became obstacles. "Sie sind ein weiteres, nicht zu unterschätzendes Hindernis auf der Gravel-Fahrt ins Glück" (They are another obstacle not to be underestimated on the gravel ride to happiness). (https://www.bike-x.de/mitgefahren-rasantes-woerthersee-gravel-race/)

**Wrong race selection [UNKNOWN - MTB racer]:** "I learned that flat gravel courses are not for me. That's more a confirmation than a learning. I just don't have the power to sprint out of every corner." Concluded the race didn't suit MTB-focused riders and planned to target elevation-heavy races instead (Alpine Gravel Challenge with 4000m climbing). (https://trailstories.net/2024/05/20/woerthersee-gravel-race)

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Organization quality [ELITE]:** Caroline Schiff called it "the best-organized gravel race in Europe that she had ever taken part in." (https://ucigravelworldseries.com/en/veldamworthersee/)

**Pre-race communication [UNKNOWN]:** Thomas noted: "Nach der Anmeldung erhielten wir regelmäßig E-Mails mit Informationen: was einzupacken ist, wie die Ausrüstung vorzubereiten ist, aus welchem Sektor wir starten" (After registration we received regular emails with information: what to pack, how to prepare equipment, which sector we're starting from). "Alles, was man braucht, um sich gut betreut zu fühlen" (Everything you need to feel well taken care of). (https://www.bike-x.de/mitgefahren-rasantes-woerthersee-gravel-race/)

**Start atmosphere [UNKNOWN]:** "Zahlreiche Zuschauer am Start feuern die Starter an" (Numerous spectators at the start cheer on the starters). "Gute Laune überall am Start. Da können die knapp sechs Grad und der ecklig kühle Ost-Wind auch nichts gegen ausrichten" (Good mood everywhere at the start. The barely six degrees and nasty cold east wind can't change that). Riders with "verschiedensten Ambitionen" (most varied ambitions) — from pros to "Kalle aus Schotterhausen, der just for fun auch einmal die Welt des Schotterns erleben möchte. Alle sind sie für einen Tag gemeinsam Stars" (Kalle from Gravel-town who just for fun wants to experience the world of gravel. They're all stars together for a day). (https://www.bike-x.de/mitgefahren-rasantes-woerthersee-gravel-race/)

**On-course support [UNKNOWN]:** Feed stations had great atmosphere with "Zuschauer in Liegestühlen auf der Wiese schauen sich das Spektakel der Qualen seelenruhig an oder feuern mit voller Inbrunst die Fahrer enthusiastisch an. Die Stimmung ist der eines Radsport-Klassikers würdig" (Spectators in deck chairs on the lawn calmly watch the spectacle of suffering or enthusiastically cheer riders with full passion. The atmosphere is worthy of a cycling classic). "Trinkflaschen werden den vorbeihuschenden Fahrern angereicht, die das Angebot dankend annehmen" (Water bottles are handed to riders whizzing by, who gratefully accept the offer). (https://www.bike-x.de/mitgefahren-rasantes-woerthersee-gravel-race/)

**Event scale:** 2024 premiere had 1200 starters from 36 nations and sold out in the first year. 2025 grew to "Close 2000 competitors from over 40 countries." The limit was raised to 1000 for future editions. (https://pedalperformancegroup.com/strongest-uci-gravel-world-series-pro-field-ever-at-the-worthersee-gravel-race/ and https://magazinebike.com/2025/04/17/veni-vidi-vici-qualification-won-worthersee-gravel-race-2025/)

**Weekend festival atmosphere:** The event is described as a "gravel bike weekend" and "real gravel festival" with expo featuring 25+ exhibitors, bike service, bike wash, massage service, kids' events (Gralf's Kids), leisure rides (Find Gralf), and athlete presentations with autograph sessions. Start/finish area is "in front of the Falkensteiner Schlosshotel Velden with a large expo." (https://www.woerthersee-gravel.com/en/program/ and https://pedalperformancegroup.com/strongest-uci-gravel-world-series-pro-field-ever-at-the-worthersee-gravel-race/)

**Unique character:** The race is branded around "Gralf" — a legend/mascot character. Events include "Beat Gralf" (UCI race), "Catch Gralf" (everyman race), and "Find Gralf" (leisure ride). There's even "Gralf's Brother From Another Mother" contest. This branding creates a distinctive identity compared to other gravel races. (https://www.woerthersee-gravel.com/en/program/)

**Location appeal:** "Nestled in the beautiful Carinthian landscape, the region offers a variety of routes for every level." The race features "breathtaking scenery of Lake Wörthersee," "still snow-covered mountains in the background," and proximity to Italy and Slovenia. The lake is "one of the warmest Alpine lakes" with "unmistakable Mediterranean flair."
