**Terrain Character:**
The course travels through "vast sagebrush plateaus, weave through towering hoodoos, and roll past historic mining towns frozen in time. Then, it's up into subalpine terrain, stacking up 10,000 feet of vert before dropping into a wicked, white-knuckle descent through the jaw-dropping Sinks Canyon State Park." Described as having "rough roads. Brutal climbs. Cutoff times." with "everything from fast-rolling gravel to chunky, soul-crushing sections." (https://www.wyo131.com/131mile)

The race starts at Lander City Park at 405 Fremont St in early morning darkness (hence mandatory bike light). (https://www.wyo131.com/131mile)

**Aid Station Strategy:**
- **Miles 36.5 and 103:** Crew NOT allowed at these stations. "This is to avoid/reduce traffic passing the racers" and keep the narrow mountain road clear. Riders must rely on race-provided hydration, nutrition, and mechanical support.
- **Miles 20, 60, and 90:** Crew access permitted. Mile 60 and 90 are designated bail points.

The course description warns: "Strategically placed aid stations will be your lifeline, stocked with hydration, nutrition, and mechanical support—but don't get too comfortable. Cutoffs are real, and the clock won't wait." (https://www.wyo131.com/131mile)

**Pre-Race Preparation:**
"Proper preparation is key, and we recommend thorough training and familiarization with the terrain." Race organizers note: "YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR OWN NAVIGATION" (https://www.wyo131.com/131mile)

## DNF Risk Factors

**Official Warning:**
"This isn't for beginners; it's for those who live for the suffer and thrive on the grind." The race description is explicit: "Some won't finish." (https://www.wyo131.com/131mile)

**Cutoff-Related DNFs:**
The strict cutoff times are enforced: "ALL PARTICIPANTS MUST BE LEAVING THE CHECK POINTS BY THE CUT OFF TIME OR THEY WILL BE PICKED UP BY THE SWEEPER AND MAY HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL A COURSE MARSHALL IS AVAILBLE TO TAKE THEM BACK TO TOWN." (https://www.wyo131.com/131mile)

**Critical Sections:**
- **Miles 60-90 rough/washboard section** during typically windy conditions: "This is traditionally a rough patch of road. Extremely wash boarded and winds usually pick up."
- **Limited crew support** at miles 36.5 and 103 means self-sufficiency is critical
- **Mile 90 Atlantic City** is the final bail point with shuttle support

**Mechanical Vulnerabilities:**
The mandatory carry list emphasizes redundancy: "At least two spare inner tubes" and specifically recommends chain lube, suggesting chain issues may be common on the rough terrain. (https://www.wyo131.com/131mile)
