**Jenny Graham [COMPETITIVE]:** "OK, so this is a bit of a cop-out. But because the route has so much wilderness, every coffee opportunity was anticipated and enjoyed! But if I had to pick just one then the little village cafe of Ravenscar Tea Rooms was an absolute delight!" (https://us.alpkit.com/blogs/deeds/adventure-cycling-in-north-yorkshire-route-yc)

**Jenny Graham [COMPETITIVE]:** "The North Yorkshire Moors Railway steam train cutting its way through the Moors to the coast as it travels between Pickering and Whitby.

## Terrain Details (Rider Perspective)

**Jenny Graham [COMPETITIVE] - Best Climb:** "Yorkshire is full extreme undulation! But rounding the corner from Lockton and see the road drop into the ravine and remerge up the other side did it for me. Its maybe 'only' a 100m climb but with a hairpin bend and steep gradient it leaves you with a little taste of alpine." (https://us.alpkit.com/blogs/deeds/adventure-cycling-in-north-yorkshire-route-yc)

**Jenny Graham [COMPETITIVE] - Best Singletrack:** "Across Levisham Moor was properly lush! I loved being out of the woods and roaming across the Moors, such a unique landscape." (https://us.alpkit.com/blogs/deeds/adventure-cycling-in-north-yorkshire-route-yc)

**Jenny Graham [COMPETITIVE] - Best Sunrise:** "A very early start saw us standing on Flamborough Head with the chalky white cliffs towering over us with the sun rising on the sea. Perfect!" (https://us.alpkit.com/blogs/deeds/adventure-cycling-in-north-yorkshire-route-yc)

**Official terrain description:** "Singletrack, gravel paths, forestry roads and public roads" (https://dirtdash.cc/yorkshire/)

## Race Strategy & Pacing

**Event format [ALL LEVELS]:** "non-timed, self-supported reliability trial with overnight camping" - This is explicitly NOT a race. Start: Saturday 9am at the YHA in Whitby, Finish: Sunday afternoon/evening at the YHA in Whitby. (https://dirtdash.cc/yorkshire/)

**Navigation [ALL LEVELS]:** "The route will be supplied electronically before the event. The course is not marked, you are responsible for your own navigation." (https://dirtdash.cc/yorkshire/)

**Jenny Graham's approach [COMPETITIVE]:** The rides were plotted to appeal "to a wide range of cyclists from family tourers to outright endurance seekers" and Graham rode with Markus Stitz and Mark Beaumont, noting: "Mark and I make sure there is enough coffee stops planned into the day and give helpful feedback like do we really need another hill, Markus?"

## Community Feel & Atmosphere

**Event description:** "Join us for a cycling event and a fun and inclusive weekend in a great natural environment." (https://dirtdash.cc/yorkshire/)

**Camping provision:** "We provide a suitable place to pitch your tent with other riders, toilets, drinking water supply, catering. There is a cafe on site. The nearest shop is about 3km away." Riders are provided "a complimentary evening meal and breakfast. Vegetarian, vegan and gluten-free version are available on request. You need to bring your own bowl, mug, fork and spoon." (https://dirtdash.cc/yorkshire/)

**Jenny Graham [COMPETITIVE] on accommodation:** "Whitby YHA blew my mind. It's a magnificent building held with in spectacular setting. Sandwiched between the historic ruins of Whitby Abbey and the graveyard that inspired Count Dracula, it offers amazing views of the seaside town and North York Moors. There's a steep cobbled road (or 199steps) to follow into the old town. At night the streets twinkle so much you'd easily mistake it for something out of Harry Potter!" (https://us.alpkit.com/blogs/deeds/adventure-cycling-in-north-yorkshire-route-yc)

**Event philosophy:** "It's not a race, it's a reliability trial! Stay cool, be nice, don't hurt yourself or others." (https://dirtdash.cc/yorkshire/)
