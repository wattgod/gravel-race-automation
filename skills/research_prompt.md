# Comprehensive Race Research Methodology

## Research Depth Requirements

**This is non-negotiable: Research must be COMPREHENSIVE.**

Every race brief requires deep research across multiple source types. Surface-level Googling produces generic content. The differentiator is specificity that only comes from triangulating multiple perspectives.

### Required Source Categories

**1. Official Sources**
- Race website (current year + archived versions via Wayback Machine)
- Race results/timing data (finishing times, DNF rates, field sizes over time)
- Course maps and elevation profiles
- Official social media (Instagram, Facebook announcements)
- Press releases and media kits

**2. Forum Deep Dives**
- **Reddit:** Search r/gravelcycling, r/cycling, r/Velo for race name
  - Race reports (gold mine for suffering zones, unexpected challenges)
  - "Is [race] worth it?" threads
  - Equipment/tire recommendation threads (reveals terrain truth)
  - Weather horror stories
- **TrainerRoad Forum:** Search for race name
  - Training approach discussions
  - Pacing strategy threads
  - "How hard is [race] really?" posts
- **Slowtwitch** (for races with triathlete crossover)
- **Weight Weenies** (equipment-focused insights)

**3. YouTube Research**
- Race recap videos (watch for course footage, not just highlights)
- GCN/TrainerRoad/Dylan Johnson coverage
- Amateur race reports (often more honest than pro content)
- **READ THE COMMENTS** - real riders share what videos don't show
- Look for multi-year comparisons (how has race changed?)

**4. Strava/RideWithGPS**
- Segment data for key climbs
- Ride reports with photos
- Surface condition notes
- Local rider insights in comments

**5. Podcasts & Interviews**
- Race director interviews (origin story, philosophy)
- Pro rider race reports
- Coaching podcasts discussing race-specific prep

**6. News & Media**
- VeloNews, CyclingTips, Escape Collective coverage
- Local newspaper articles (often have details nationals miss)
- Race incident reports (crashes, weather events, controversies)

### Research Process

**Step 1: Cast Wide Net (30 min)**
- Search "[Race Name] race report" across all platforms
- Search "[Race Name] reddit" 
- Search "[Race Name] review"
- Open 15-20 tabs minimum

**Step 2: Extract Specifics (45 min)**
- Document specific mile markers where shit gets hard
- Note weather patterns across multiple years
- Collect direct quotes from forum posts (for Black Pill authenticity)
- Identify recurring themes (what do people consistently mention?)

**Step 3: Verify & Cross-Reference (15 min)**
- Cross-check stats against official sources
- Confirm distances/elevation haven't changed
- Note any recent course changes

**Step 4: Find the Angle (15 min)**
- What's the story nobody else is telling?
- What do the forums say that the marketing doesn't?
- What's the uncomfortable truth?

### What "Comprehensive" Looks Like

**NOT comprehensive:**
- "Unbound is a 200-mile gravel race in Kansas known for being challenging"
- Generic stats pulled from race website only
- No specific mile markers or suffering zones named
- Black Pill that could apply to any race

**COMPREHENSIVE:**
- "The Teterville rollers at mile 120 are where Unbound breaks people - 15 miles of 8-12% peanut butter hills when your legs are already cooked"
- Forum quote: "I've done Leadville twice and IMTX. Unbound 200 was harder than both."
- Specific weather data: "In 2023, temps hit 103°F by 2pm. In 2019, thunderstorms forced a 2-hour shelter-in-place at mile 80."
- DNF rate trends with reasons (mechanicals vs bonking vs cutoff)

### Research Quality Checklist

Before writing the brief, verify you can answer:

- [ ] What are the 3 specific sections where people suffer most? (with mile markers)
- [ ] What does the forum consensus say about difficulty vs marketing claims?
- [ ] What weather scenarios have actually happened in past years?
- [ ] What equipment failures are common? (reveals terrain truth)
- [ ] What do repeat racers say is different from first-timers' expectations?
- [ ] What's the real DNF rate and why do people quit?
- [ ] What logistics catch people off guard?
- [ ] What's the one thing everyone wishes they'd known?

**If you can't answer these, you haven't researched enough.**
