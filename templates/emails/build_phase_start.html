        <p>Hey {athlete_name},</p>

        <p>You're entering the build phase. This is where the base fitness you've built
        gets sharpened into race-ready form.</p>

        <h3>What to Expect</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Higher intensity sessions.</strong> VO2max intervals, threshold work, and sweet spot efforts.</li>
            <li><strong>Longer weekend rides.</strong> These should include race nutrition practice.</li>
            <li><strong>More fatigue.</strong> This is normal. Recovery weeks are built in.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Key Adjustments</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fueling:</strong> Increase carb intake on hard days. You can't build fitness on empty.</li>
            <li><strong>Sleep:</strong> Prioritize 8+ hours. This is non-negotiable during build phase.</li>
            <li><strong>Listen to your body:</strong> If you're too fatigued to hit power targets, take an extra easy day. Missing one session is better than overtraining for a week.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The work you put in now shows up on race day. Let's go.</p>
