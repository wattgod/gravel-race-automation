        <p>Hey {athlete_name},</p>

        <p>This is your first recovery week. It's supposed to feel easy. That's the point.</p>

        <h3>Why Recovery Weeks Matter</h3>
        <p>Your body doesn't get stronger during workouts — it gets stronger during recovery.
        The hard sessions from the past weeks created the stimulus. This week is when the
        adaptation actually happens.</p>

        <h3>What to Do</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Follow the plan exactly.</strong> No bonus rides.</li>
            <li><strong>Sleep 8+ hours.</strong> This is when growth hormone peaks.</li>
            <li><strong>Eat well.</strong> Your body is rebuilding — give it fuel.</li>
            <li><strong>Light mobility work.</strong> Foam rolling, stretching, easy walks.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What NOT to Do</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Do NOT add intensity because you "feel good"</li>
            <li>Do NOT extend the easy rides</li>
            <li>Do NOT feel guilty about resting</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You'll come back stronger next week. That's how this works.</p>
