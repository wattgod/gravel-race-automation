        <p>Hey {athlete_name},</p>

        <p>You're at the midpoint of your {plan_duration}-week plan. Time for a progress check.</p>

        <h3>Signs You're on Track</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Easy rides feel easier than they did in Week 1</li>
            <li>You can hold conversations at Zone 2 effort</li>
            <li>Recovery between hard sessions is getting faster</li>
            <li>You're sleeping and eating consistently</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What's Coming Next</h3>
        <p>The build phase ramps up intensity. You'll start doing more race-specific work:
        longer sweet spot efforts, tempo rides, and longer weekend rides with race nutrition practice.</p>

        <h3>FTP Test Reminder</h3>
        <p>If you have an FTP test scheduled this week, do it fresh (after a rest day).
        Your zones will update based on the new number. Even a small improvement means
        the plan is working.</p>

        <p>Keep going. The hardest part is behind you.</p>
