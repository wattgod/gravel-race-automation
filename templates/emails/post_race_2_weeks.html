        <p>Hey {athlete_name},</p>

        <p>It's been two weeks since {race_name}. How are the legs feeling?</p>

        <h3>Options for What's Next</h3>

        <p><strong>Option 1: Another race?</strong><br>
        If you've got another event on the calendar, let me know. We can build a plan
        that builds on the fitness you've already developed — no need to start from scratch.</p>

        <p><strong>Option 2: Off-season maintenance</strong><br>
        If you're done racing for the season, a structured off-season keeps you from
        losing all that hard-earned fitness while giving your body a mental and physical break.</p>

        <p><strong>Option 3: Just ride</strong><br>
        Sometimes the best thing is to ride without a plan for a while. No structure,
        no power targets. Just enjoy the bike. That's fine too.</p>

        <h3>Stay Connected</h3>

        and plan updates. And if you know someone who's training for their first
        gravel race, send them my way.</p>

        <p>It's been a pleasure working with you. Until next time.</p>
