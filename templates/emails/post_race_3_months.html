        <p>Hey {athlete_name},</p>

        <p>It's been three months since {race_name}. How's the riding going?</p>

        <h3>What's Your Next Move?</h3>

        <p><strong>Got another race on the calendar?</strong><br>
        If you're eyeing a fall event or next season's big one, now is the perfect time
        to start building a plan. The earlier we start, the more gradual (and effective)
        the progression.</p>

        <p><strong>Want an off-season plan?</strong><br>
        A structured off-season keeps you from losing the fitness you built while giving
        your body and mind a break. Think of it as maintenance mode — not grinding, but
        not starting from zero next spring either.</p>

        <p><strong>Just want to ride?</strong><br>
        That's great too. Sometimes the best training is no training. Just enjoy the bike.
        When you're ready for structure again, I'll be here.</p>

        <p>Whatever you decide, the fitness you built hasn't disappeared. It's easier to
        rebuild than to build from scratch.</p>

        <p>Reply to this email if you want to talk about what's next.</p>
