        <p>Hey {athlete_name},</p>

        <p>Now that {race_name} is behind you and you've had a week to recover,
        I'd love your honest feedback on the training plan.</p>

        <h3>One Question</h3>
        <p style="background: #e8e8e0; padding: 15px; font-size: 1.1em;">
            <strong>On a scale of 0-10, how likely are you to recommend this training plan
            to a friend who's training for a gravel race?</strong>
        </p>

        <p>Just reply to this email with your number and any notes. No form to fill out,
        no survey to click through.</p>

        <h3>What Helps Most</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>What part of the plan worked best for you?</li>
            <li>What would you change?</li>
            <li>Did you feel prepared on race day?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Your feedback directly shapes how I build plans for future athletes.
        Every response matters.</p>

        <p>Thanks for trusting the process.</p>
