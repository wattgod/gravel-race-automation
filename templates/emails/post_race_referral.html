        <p>Hey {athlete_name},</p>

        <p>If you got value from your training plan, the best way to support what I'm building
        is to tell someone about it.</p>

        <h3>Who This Is For</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A friend training for their first gravel race</li>
            <li>A riding buddy who's been winging it without a plan</li>
            <li>Someone on your team who wants to level up</li>
            <li>That person who always asks "how do you train?"</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What They Get</h3>
        <p>The same thing you got — a personalized, week-by-week training plan built around
        their schedule, their fitness level, and their race. Plus injury accommodations,
        nutrition guidance, and strength training.</p>

        <p>Just send them to <strong>gravelgodcycling.com</strong> or forward this email.
        If they mention your name, I'll make sure they get priority.</p>

        <p>Thanks for spreading the word.</p>
