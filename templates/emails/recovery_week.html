        <p>Hey {athlete_name},</p>

        <p>This week is a scheduled recovery week. You know the drill by now, but the reminder still matters.</p>

        <h3>The Science</h3>
        <p>Training creates micro-damage. Recovery is when your body repairs and comes back stronger.
        Skip the recovery and you just accumulate fatigue without adaptation. That's how injuries happen.</p>

        <h3>This Week</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Follow the plan.</strong> Easy rides only. No intensity.</li>
            <li><strong>Sleep.</strong> 8+ hours. This is your most important training tool this week.</li>
            <li><strong>Eat well.</strong> Your body is rebuilding — don't restrict calories.</li>
            <li><strong>Move gently.</strong> Light stretching, foam rolling, easy walks.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You'll feel restless. That's normal. Trust the process — the hard work starts again next week.</p>
