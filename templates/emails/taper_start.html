        <p>Hey {athlete_name},</p>

        <p>The hard work is done. Seriously — nothing you do in the next two weeks will make
        you fitter. But it can make you faster.</p>

        <h3>What Taper Means</h3>
        <p>Volume drops. Intensity stays sharp. Your body absorbs the training you've done
        over the past {plan_duration} weeks and converts it into race-day power.</p>

        <h3>What to Expect</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>You'll feel restless.</strong> That's the taper working. Your legs are loading up.</li>
            <li><strong>You might feel "slow."</strong> Normal. Fatigue masks fitness. When fatigue drops, you'll fly.</li>
            <li><strong>Sleep may be weird.</strong> You have more energy. Channel it into rest.</li>
            <li><strong>Don't add volume.</strong> Trust the plan. Trust the science.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>This Week's Priority</h3>
        <p>Short, sharp efforts to keep the engine running. Follow the workouts exactly — they're
        designed to sharpen you without adding fatigue.</p>

        <p>Almost there.</p>
