        <p>Hey {athlete_name},</p>

        <p>Welcome to Week 1 of your {plan_duration}-week training plan. Here's what to focus on this week:</p>

        <h3>This Week's Priorities</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Import your ZWO files</strong> into Zwift or TrainingPeaks. Instructions are in your training guide.</li>
            <li><strong>Set up your training zones</strong> — if you have an FTP, use it. If not, your first FTP test is scheduled this week.</li>
            <li><strong>Follow the plan, not your ego.</strong> Week 1 should feel easy. That's by design.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Common First-Week Mistakes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Going too hard on "easy" days (Zone 2 means <em>conversational</em> pace)</li>
            <li>Skipping strength training (it prevents injury and makes you faster)</li>
            <li>Not eating enough (training requires fuel)</li>
        </ul>
