        <p>Hey {athlete_name},</p>

        <p>Quick check-in. You've had a full week of training. How's it feeling?</p>

        <h3>Things That Are Normal</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Feeling like the workouts are "too easy" — they should be right now</li>
            <li>Sore from strength training — your body is adapting</li>
            <li>Wondering if the plan is hard enough — trust the process</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Things That Aren't Normal</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Sharp pain during any exercise (stop and let me know)</li>
            <li>Not being able to complete the scheduled workouts (we may need to adjust)</li>
            <li>Feeling overwhelmed by the volume (we can scale back)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Hit reply and let me know how it's going. Even a one-line "all good" helps me know you're on track.</p>
