Adventure. 3 out of 5. This race takes you somewhere different. The only UCI gravel race starting in one country and finishing in another delivers cross-border exploration. Experience. 3 out of 5. The experience justifies the entry fee. Starting at UNESCO World Heritage fortifications in Elvas and finishing at Guadiana Park in historic Badajoz creates cultural depth. Community. 3 out of 5. Community is a real selling point. Being part of the UCI series means qualifying opportunities for age-group riders chasing World Championships spots. Value. 3 out of 5. Fair value. You get what you pay for. €50-70 tiered entry fees are reasonable for a UCI-sanctioned event with World Championship qualifying opportunities. Logistics. 2 out of 5. Functional. Not impressive. Cross-border start in Elvas, Portugal and finish in Badajoz, Spain creates obvious transportation complications with zero guidance provided. Technicality. 2 out of 5. Your road bike might survive. Might. Course features 65% gravel and 35% paved roads through rolling terrain with no major sustained climbs.",
