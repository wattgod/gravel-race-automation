The Goldilocks zone of suffering. 110km hits the sweet spot for challenging gravel without becoming an endurance death march. Climate. 3 out of 5. The weather could go either way. Historical weather data shows average highs of 60°F and lows of 42°F, with a 47% chance of rain on any given day. Adventure. 3 out of 5. Genuine adventure elements. Expect the unexpected. Route explores varied terrain through Capcir, Formiguères, and around Lake Calvet with forest trails and rocky paths typical of the southwest Pyrenees. Experience. 3 out of 5. Memorable course. Has character. Post-race prize ceremony at 7 PM same day with music evening invitation creates proper celebration atmosphere. Community. 3 out of 5. Community is a real selling point. Regional French cycling culture runs deep, and the race builds on an established road event with local support. Value. 3 out of 5. The math works out. Barely. €80 for 110km includes timing, aid stations, medal, welcome bag, and 30% discounts on local activities like cable cars and spa access. Logistics. 2 out of 5. You'll figure it out. Eventually. On-site only packet pickup with complete file required screams bureaucratic nightmare, especially for international riders.",
