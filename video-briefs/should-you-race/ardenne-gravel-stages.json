Packet pickup windows are reasonable (09:00-11:30 Friday, 07:00-08:45 Saturday) with secure parking and camping access. Elevation. 3 out of 5. Proper climbing. You'll earn your descents. The climbing builds logically: 1,370m on the 70km opener, 1,800m on the 110km queen stage, and 1,620m on the 90km finale. Climate. 3 out of 5. Variable. Bring layers and a flexible attitude. Late September conditions turned Stage 1 into a \"muddy course\" that affected elite tactics, with Trouwborst taking early control in the slick conditions. Adventure. 3 out of 5. Adventure factor is real. Multi-day stage racing through Wallonian forests with different daily start locations (Vielsalm, Centre Adeps d'Engreux, Baraque Fraiture) creates proper adventure variety. Experience. 3 out of 5. The experience justifies the entry fee. Trouwborst's overall victory despite Stage 2 mechanicals and early Stage 3 puncture shows the format rewards consistency over single-stage heroics. Community. 3 out of 5. Community is a real selling point. Organizers recommend the full weekend to \"fully experience the unique Ardenne Gravel Stages\" rather than cherry-picking days. Value. 3 out of 5. The math works out. Barely. 149€ for three days including meals, camping, bike wash, and secure parking competes well with single-day European events.",
