Community is a real selling point. The venue earns praise for its \"gorgeous venue and delicious post-ride meals\" at the artisan cheese farm. Logistics. 2 out of 5. Functional. Not impressive. The race starts at Back Forty Artisan Cheese Farm on 1406 Gulley Road, but rider navigation issues plagued the 2025 event. Technicality. 2 out of 5. Mild technical demands. Pick decent tires. Single lane treed gravel roads through challenging sections at Ranger Camp, North Shore, and Clarendon test bike handling skills. Elevation. 2 out of 5. Rolling terrain. Nothing that'll break you. Rolling hills through North Frontenac and Lanark Highlands create steady climbing rather than explosive ascents.",
