This race takes you somewhere different. Michigan spring weather guarantees you won't know what you're getting until race morning - could be snow, mud, dust, or ice. Prestige. 3 out of 5. Established race. Solid reputation. The 'world's largest gravel road race' title carries weight when you're talking 5,500 riders and $40k in cash prizes. Race Quality. 3 out of 5. Well-run race. Professional touches throughout. Experience. 3 out of 5. You'll remember this one. Mostly fondly. 70 kegs of Founders Brewery and a festival atmosphere make for a proper post-race celebration. Community. 3 out of 5. Genuine community feel. People stick around. Value. 3 out of 5. Fair value. You get what you pay for. $119 for 100 miles with $40k in total prize money and a massive post-race party is fair market rate.",
