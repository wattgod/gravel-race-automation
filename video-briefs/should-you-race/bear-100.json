Reasonable costs. Plan a modest budget. Community. 3 out of 5. Good vibes. Riders actually talk to each other. Twelve years of tradition in tiny Laona creates a small-town gathering with 100% of proceeds supporting Laona Rescue Squad equipment and training. Technicality. 2 out of 5. Your road bike might survive. Might. Elevation. 2 out of 5. Some ups and downs. Manageable. The 3,500 feet over 100 miles delivers rolling Wisconsin forest terrain without major sustained climbs. Climate. 2 out of 5. Mostly pleasant. Check the forecast anyway. Early May northern Wisconsin brings dramatic temperature swings from 31°F overnight frost to 85°F midday heat. Adventure. 2 out of 5. Mild adventure. Scenic ride with a number plate. Hidden gravel roads through Nicolet National Forest plus the 7 PM support cutoff creates consequence for route selection.",
