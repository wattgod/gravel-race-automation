Nevada's remote desert terrain and state park camping setting delivers adventure factor. Logistics. 2 out of 5. You'll figure it out. Eventually. Camping at Beaver Dam State Park handles lodging, but organizer Dawn Andone warns 'the closest town is 35 miles down a gravel road. Length. 2 out of 5. Short but honest about it. Dawn Andone notes 'riders usually complete the course in six hours' for the 50-mile distance. Technicality. 2 out of 5. Mild technical demands. Pick decent tires. Coach Mark Orton describes surfaces that 'vary from hard-packed dirt to softball-sized rocks. Elevation. 2 out of 5. Some ups and downs. Manageable. Course travels 'along the rim of the park so you can see all the geologic formations' at approximately 5,000 feet elevation. Climate. 2 out of 5. Weather cooperates more often than not. 2021 temperatures reached 106°F during the event, while 33 riders 'battled the wind' in 2022. Altitude. 2 out of 5. Negligible altitude effect.
