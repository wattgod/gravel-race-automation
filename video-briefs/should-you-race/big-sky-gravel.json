Three distance options (22, 50, 100 miles) with staggered starts from 7:00 AM to 9:30 AM accommodate different capabilities well. Technicality. 3 out of 5. Requires line choice. Rewards the attentive rider. Course description promises \"rolling hills and mostly smooth gravel roads\" through Montana ranching country. Elevation. 3 out of 5. The hills sort the trained from the untrained. The 100-mile route delivers \"over 6,000 ft in elevation gain along the foothills of the Beartooth mountains\" with meaningful climbs including Virginia City. Altitude. 3 out of 5. Altitude starts to matter here. Red Lodge sits in Beartooth foothills with the race reaching elevations high enough to impact performance. Adventure. 3 out of 5. Adventure factor is real. \"The Red Lodge and surrounding area is known for its immense landscapes connected by gravel roads in Carbon County. Value. 3 out of 5. Fair value. You get what you pay for. $70-$107 registration includes finish food, rider gift, swag bag, route nutrition, hydration, and SAG support - decent package for Montana pricing. Logistics. 2 out of 5. Functional. Not impressive. Downtown Red Lodge start/finish at Roosevelt Center works for lodging access, but packet pickup runs until 6:30 AM race morning suggests thin staffing. Climate. 2 out of 5. Weather cooperates more often than not. Historical weather data shows average highs of 77°F and lows of 55°F, with a 28% chance of rain on any given day.",
