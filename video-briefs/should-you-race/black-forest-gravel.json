The weather could go either way. Historical weather data shows average highs of 75°F and lows of 56°F, with a 51% chance of rain on any given day. Adventure. 3 out of 5. This race takes you somewhere different. The Black Forest delivers backcountry mystique through \"Lange Schotter Alleen\" (long gravel avenues) with \"no cell service\" reported by riders. Experience. 3 out of 5. You'll remember this one. Mostly fondly. The Black Forest delivers adventure through Dreisamtal with riders praising \"breathtaking views of rural terrain\" and wildlife encounters. Community. 3 out of 5. Community is a real selling point. Value. 3 out of 5. The math works out. Barely. €70 entry fee includes all food and drink at GenussHotSpots throughout the route, offering \"Black Forest tapas, barista coffee, ice cream, and Rothaus beer.",
