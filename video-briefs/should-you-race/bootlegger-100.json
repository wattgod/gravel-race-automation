Plan accordingly. 107 miles with 10,604 feet of climbing creates the distance-elevation combination that defines mountain gravel suffering. Technicality. 4 out of 5. Bike handling matters here. Practice your descents. K-Dogg describes descents with \"dump trucks of marbles strewn everywhere\" that caused hand cramps from \"desperately clutching the brakes. Adventure. 4 out of 5. The kind of ride you'll tell stories about. Wilson Creek Gorge puts you deep into North Georgia mountain isolation where cell service dies and self-reliance matters. Race Quality. 4 out of 5. The kind of race that spoils you for others. Pisgah Productions knows how to put on events - they've built a series around this terrain for a reason. Experience. 4 out of 5. The kind of race that reshapes your season. 10,000 feet of climbing over 100 miles through North Georgia mountains creates the kind of suffering that bonds riders for life. Community. 4 out of 5. Strong community. This race builds friendships. K-Dogg describes \"a huge crowd of cheerful and polite adventurers\" with opportunities for \"toccata conversations with riders from many scattered states. Value. 4 out of 5. Good value. More bang for your buck than most. You're paying for 100 miles of North Georgia mountain punishment - that's substantial course for the money.",
