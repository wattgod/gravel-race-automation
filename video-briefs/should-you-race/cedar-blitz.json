Downtown Cedar Springs start/finish at the brewery creates centralized logistics with post-race festival atmosphere. Length. 3 out of 5. Long enough to matter. Short enough to recover. Four distance options from 18-mile beginner to 130-mile ultra hit the right spread. Community. 3 out of 5. Community is a real selling point. Strong community building draws riders nationally — \"The BaseCamp community has given me so many cycling friends from across the country. Expenses. 3 out of 5. Mid-range expenses. Budget a proper race weekend. Technicality. 2 out of 5. Some chunky bits. Nothing catastrophic. Beth Huffaker describes the course as \"fast, no chunky gravel and no giant hills\" - flowing rather than punishing through Michigan farmland. Elevation. 2 out of 5. A few hills. Nothing to lose sleep over. Rider reports confirm \"no giant hills\" through the 3000 feet of elevation over 62 miles. Climate. 2 out of 5. Mostly pleasant. Check the forecast anyway.
