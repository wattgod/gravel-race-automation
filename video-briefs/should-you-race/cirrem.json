The equipment list—\"mountain bikes, cross bikes, ss's, fenders, fixies, fat bikes and even road bikes\"—shows this crowd prioritizes showing up over showing off. Value. 3 out of 5. Reasonable price for what's offered. Registration includes 8AM breakfast, halfway checkpoint food, post-race lunch, and finishing at a tap house in Cumming, Iowa. Expenses. 3 out of 5. Plan for a few hundred all-in. Logistics. 2 out of 5. Functional. Not impressive. Registration opens 9pm November 27th and \"will fill up in a few minutes\" for 500 spots maximum. Technicality. 2 out of 5. Mild technical demands. Pick decent tires. Madison County's winding hills include bridges with \"spaces between the boards that eat wheels for lunch—seriously, a friend separated his shoulder last weekend on it. Elevation. 2 out of 5.
