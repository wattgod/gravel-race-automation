Community. 4 out of 5. The post-race scene is half the event. The collegiate cycling community will target their first-ever gravel nationals opportunity. Length. 3 out of 5. Proper race distance. Enough to hurt. The medium course runs approximately 50 miles according to Valley of Tears, though some sources list 62 miles. Elevation. 3 out of 5.
