Double-digit hours are on the table. 98km Full Fondo winner finished in 3:05:56, proving this isn't a coffee ride despite the shorter distance than advertised. Technicality. 3 out of 5. The course bites if you stop paying attention. Elite rider Kai Vander Veen described \"the mixture of climbs and then descents made for a great race\" with roads in excellent condition. Elevation. 3 out of 5. The hills sort the trained from the untrained. Vander Veen's emphasis on \"climbs and then descents\" through Cowichan Valley's rolling hills suggests consistent elevation changes rather than one monster climb. Climate. 3 out of 5. The weather could go either way. Historical weather data shows average highs of 65°F and lows of 45°F, with a 61% chance of rain on any given day. Adventure. 3 out of 5. Genuine adventure elements. Expect the unexpected. Course features \"diverse and stunning natural landscapes, including forests, rivers, lakes, and mountains\" plus passes by farms and vineyards through private Mosaic property. Race Quality. 3 out of 5. Good race quality. No major complaints. Four distance options from 25km to 165km shows they understand different rider needs, and the Full Fondo Plus winner finishing in 5:15:36 suggests real terrain. Experience. 3 out of 5. The experience justifies the entry fee. Post-ride includes Okanagan Spring Beer Garden, Sapinos pizza, and souvenir socks at the Lower Ballfield finish. Community. 3 out of 5. Genuine community feel. People stick around. Vancouver Island cycling community shows up consistently for eight editions running, which says something about repeat value.",
