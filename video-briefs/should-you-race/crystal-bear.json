The Crystal Bear is an overnight point-to-point bikepacking odyssey through the Northwoods of Wisconsin and Michigan's Upper Peninsula.

The terrain itself is moderate. rolling Northwoods gravel with 8 thousand feet spread across 192 miles. but the overnight format is the real challenge. You'll spend 8-10 hours riding through pitch-black forest with only your headlight for company. Sandy sections sap momentum. Stream crossings require focus. Cold overnight temperatures demand warmth management. Sleep deprivation compounds navigation challenges. This isn't about crushing segments or chasing KOMs. It's about holding it together mentally and physically for 15-30 hours straight while entirely self-reliant.",
