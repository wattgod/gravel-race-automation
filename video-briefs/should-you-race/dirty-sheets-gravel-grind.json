Genuine community feel. People stick around. Registration proceeds fund MTB Atlanta trail building and maintenance, connecting racing to local trail advocacy. Value. 3 out of 5. Fair value. You get what you pay for. Expenses. 3 out of 5. Mid-range expenses. Budget a proper race weekend. $5 parking at Cochran Mill Park and proximity to Atlanta keep costs minimal. Technicality. 2 out of 5. Some chunky bits. Nothing catastrophic. Mark Hurley describes \"some gravel packed and other loose\" surface conditions throughout the route. Elevation. 2 out of 5. Rolling terrain. Nothing that'll break you. Kevin Akers describes \"lots of hills that are brutal when you're tired,\" capturing how the rolling terrain accumulates difficulty over distance.",
