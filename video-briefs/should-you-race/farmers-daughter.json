Distance varies by source (62-68 miles) but consistently lands in gravel's sweet spot. Climate. 3 out of 5. The weather could go either way. Experience. 3 out of 5. The experience justifies the entry fee. All finishers 21+ get Farmer's Daughter Rye IPA pint, full meal, Belgian beer glass, custom bike name plate, and hat. Community. 3 out of 5. Community is a real selling point. Event draws 482-1200 riders depending on year, with strong local charity support for Columbia Land Conservancy and Crellin Park Pump Track. Value. 3 out of 5. The math works out. Barely. Substantial finish line package includes custom beer glass, bike name plate, hat, full meal, and local brewery IPA for finishers 21+. Technicality. 2 out of 5. Mild technical demands. Pick decent tires. Mix of gravel roads, pavement, and technical singletrack creates bottlenecks. Elevation. 2 out of 5. Some ups and downs.
