The hills sort the trained from the untrained. 4000 feet over 55 miles means real climbing without being ridiculous — about 73 feet per mile. Adventure. 3 out of 5. Adventure factor is real. Riding gravel roads named after forbidden plateaus on a remote Canadian island has adventure appeal. Value. 3 out of 5. Reasonable price for what's offered. Three distance options with full aid stations, neutral mechanical support, post-race food trucks, and camping options from $10-30 provide solid package value. Logistics. 2 out of 5. Basic setup. Don't expect hand-holding. Chad Grice notes the race features 'an entirely new route' for 2023 that evolved the course design, suggesting ongoing organizational development. Length. 2 out of 5. Short but honest about it. Chad Grice finished the 104km Esperto course in 5:07:18 at recreational pace, averaging 170W and 20. Climate. 2 out of 5. Mild conditions. Nothing dramatic. Historical weather data shows average highs of 68°F and lows of 51°F, with a 45% chance of rain on any given day. Race Quality. 2 out of 5. Basic but functional. Gets the job done. Jon Watkin's organization provides three distance options with full aid station support and neutral mechanical backup.",
