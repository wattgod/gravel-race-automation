Beach start transitioning to protected coastal dunes, then dirt roads through southeast Sardinia's stunning coastline—this is proper adventure racing. Value. 5 out of 5. Punches way above its price point. You're getting Mediterranean island racing with World Series qualification for whatever the entry fee costs. Length. 4 out of 5. This is a long day. Plan accordingly. The 81-mile/122km elite distance hits the sweet spot for serious gravel racing without becoming a sufferfest. Technicality. 4 out of 5. Bike handling matters here. Practice your descents. Starting on beach sand immediately tests bike handling and power management. Elevation. 4 out of 5. Your power-to-weight ratio matters here. 8,530 feet of climbing over 81 miles delivers consistent challenge without absurd gradients—that's about 105 feet per mile. Prestige. 4 out of 5. Prestigious. People plan seasons around it. UCI Gravel World Series qualifier with 30 years of Giro Sardegna history behind it—that's real pedigree. Race Quality. 4 out of 5. High-quality event.
