Genuine community feel. People stick around. Regional field of 100-500 participants gathering for this North Texas trail running tradition held annually the third weekend in March. Value. 3 out of 5. Reasonable price for what's offered. Access to over 20,000 acres of protected grassland with aid station support and night services for longer distances. Expenses. 3 out of 5. Standard gravel race budget. Technicality. 2 out of 5. Your road bike might survive. Might.
