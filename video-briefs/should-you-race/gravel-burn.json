Serious elevation. Train your climbing legs. 11,000m of climbing over 800km creates serious vertical density across South Africa's most dramatic landscapes. Prestige. 4 out of 5. Top-shelf reputation. Calendar priority. Race Quality. 4 out of 5. Premium race experience. Full-service Burn Camps with two-night stays show they're not messing around with logistics and rider care. Community. 4 out of 5. Riders come for the race. Stay for the people. Length. 3 out of 5. Long enough to matter. Short enough to recover.
