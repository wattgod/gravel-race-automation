Course traverses Campo de Hielo Sur borders, passes Grey Glacier, crosses Strait of Magellan by ferry, and reaches King Penguin Reserve in Tierra del Fuego. Experience. 5 out of 5. Once-in-a-lifetime course experience. Puerto Natales to Caleta María through Campo de Hielo Sur is the end of the world stuff. Length. 4 out of 5. Double-digit hours are on the table. The 250K Baqueanos route has an 18-hour cutoff, while the 1000K expedition allows 6. Technicality. 3 out of 5. Technical enough to thin the pack. Course passes through Torres del Paine National Park, Cueva del Milodón, and reaches Caleta María via dirt roads and Patagonian steppe. Elevation. 3 out of 5. Proper climbing. You'll earn your descents. 8000ft over 100 miles averages 80ft per mile — nothing crazy by mountain standards but enough to matter when Patagonian weather turns. Value. 3 out of 5. Fair value. You get what you pay for. Starting at $180 USD for access to some of the most remote terrain on Earth isn't highway robbery. Climate. 2 out of 5. Weather cooperates more often than not. Historical weather data shows average highs of 70°F and lows of 50°F, with a 10% chance of rain on any given day. Altitude. 2 out of 5. Negligible altitude effect. Puerto Natales sits near sea level with the route climbing through Torres del Paine to higher elevations, but no maximum altitude data published.",
