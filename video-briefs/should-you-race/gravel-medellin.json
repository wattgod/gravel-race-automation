Length. 3 out of 5. Long enough to matter. Short enough to recover. 120km hits the sweet spot for most riders—long enough to matter, manageable enough to finish strong. Technicality. 3 out of 5. The course bites if you stop paying attention. Described as moderate terrain with rolling short steep hills and sustained climbs rather than technical rock gardens. Elevation. 3 out of 5. The hills sort the trained from the untrained. 7,500 feet of climbing over 75 miles creates substantial suffering without being soul-crushing. Climate. 3 out of 5. Variable. Bring layers and a flexible attitude. August racing in Medellín means the \"City of Eternal Spring\" delivers mild year-round temperatures of 18-28°C thanks to Andean elevation. Altitude. 3 out of 5. You'll feel it on the climbs. Starting at approximately 1,495m above sea level with climbs pushing higher into thin air territory around 2,500m elevation. Community. 3 out of 5. Good vibes. Riders actually talk to each other. Colombia's cycling culture runs deeper than most destinations, with the region described as \"filled with brightly colored towns and enchanting landscapes\" perfect for bike discovery.",
