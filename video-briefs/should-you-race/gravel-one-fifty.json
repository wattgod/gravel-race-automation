James Ion described 2025 as transforming 'normally tranquil forest and farm roads into a high-speed playground' under ideal conditions. Community. 3 out of 5. Community is a real selling point. Nearly 2,000 participants from 26 countries created strong international field, with organizers noting the Brink 'turned sporty, atmospheric, and a bit dusty. Value. 3 out of 5. The math works out. Barely. €95 for 150km UCI qualifier with nearly 2,000 participants and spectator-lined course delivers solid European race value. Technicality. 2 out of 5. Mild technical demands. Pick decent tires.
