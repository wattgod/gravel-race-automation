They won't publish entry fees, but free camping, multiple aid stations, and prize packages suggest decent bang for your buck. Expenses. 3 out of 5. Standard gravel race budget. Logistics. 2 out of 5. You'll figure it out. Eventually. Gus Wolf's report captures the challenge: started riding at 6pm after working from 5am, calling it 'What a friggin bruiser! Technicality. 2 out of 5. Mild technical demands. Pick decent tires. Travis Jolly notes the 'first major climb (right from the start)' but spent time adjusting his rebuilt single speed rather than fighting technical terrain.
