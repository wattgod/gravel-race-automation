Private Duncombe Park Estate trails and North York Moors terrain should offer technical challenge, but the 'all levels welcome' marketing suggests they've neutered the difficulty. Elevation. 3 out of 5. Proper climbing. You'll earn your descents. 4000ft over 55 miles through North York Moors National Park's undulating terrain delivers sustained climbing efforts across the private estate. Adventure. 3 out of 5. This race takes you somewhere different. Private estate access through Duncombe Park and North York Moors National Park offers exploration potential you can't replicate on public roads. Value. 3 out of 5. Fair value. You get what you pay for. £125 weekend entry includes two nights camping, parking, access to private estate trails, chip timing, feed stations, showers, and event village entertainment. Logistics. 2 out of 5. Basic setup. Don't expect hand-holding. Helmsley location in North Yorkshire requires planning as registration opens Friday at 13:00 and Saturday at 07:30. Length. 2 out of 5. Won't destroy your week. The 10km Friday night stage feels like warm-up filler before Saturday's substantial 92km across morning (52km) and afternoon (40km) loops. Climate. 2 out of 5. Mostly pleasant. Check the forecast anyway. Historical weather data shows average highs of 65°F and lows of 51°F, with a 68% chance of rain on any given day. Prestige. 2 out of 5. Building a name. Not there yet. Organized by Focal Events (creators of Europe's largest gravel event, Dirty Reiver) with SCOTT Sports UK as title sponsor for 2026.",
