Technicality. 4 out of 5. Bike handling matters here. Practice your descents. Loek Luijbregts describes the Schwalbe prologue with 'gradients reaching up to 30%, riders were pushed to their limits as they navigated steep climbs and descents. Elevation. 4 out of 5. Mountain passes on the menu. 6,562 feet over 62 miles through the Eifel forests is climbing. Prestige. 4 out of 5. Prestigious. People plan seasons around it. Value. 4 out of 5. Good value.
