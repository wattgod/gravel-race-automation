Iowa Wind and Rock is 340 miles of honest Iowa gravel: crushed limestone roads rolling through endless agricultural land with zero shelter from wind. The terrain itself is moderate. 8 thousand feet of elevation spread thin via constant short climbs. but the format is brutal. You'll ride 30-50 hours continuously, crossing into overnight hours, navigating independently with GPS, and resupplying at small-town gas stations. The wind is THE defining feature: 10-20 mph sustained headwinds and crosswinds for hours. The constant rolling terrain means you never truly rest. always climbing or grinding into wind. River valley crossings add scenic variety and punchy elevation. The self-supported format strips away all external motivation. No crowds. No aid stations. No teammates. Just you, Iowa backroads, and the mental test of keeping pedals turning for 40+ hours when quitting would be easy.",

April in Iowa delivers extreme variability from year to year. Value. 4 out of 5. One of the better deals in gravel. Free entry with donations accepted makes this exceptional value for 340 miles of organized suffering. Logistics. 3 out of 5. Adequate. The word was invented for this. Secret course revealed at start forces navigation with cue sheets on 340 miles of Iowa grid roads. Race Quality. 3 out of 5. Solid production value.
