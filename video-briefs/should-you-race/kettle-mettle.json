Built on railway grades with maximum 2. Elevation. 3 out of 5. The hills sort the trained from the untrained. The 7000ft over 80 miles provides steady climbing without brutal pitches, thanks to the historic railway grade design. Climate. 3 out of 5. Variable. Bring layers and a flexible attitude. Historical weather data shows average highs of 65°F and lows of 44°F, with a 56% chance of rain on any given day. Adventure. 3 out of 5. This race takes you somewhere different. Race Quality. 3 out of 5. Well-run race. Professional touches throughout. Justin Payeur confirms the events are \"well organized and great people turn out,\" with multiple aid stations and mechanical support positioned strategically along the route. Experience. 3 out of 5. You'll remember this one. Mostly fondly. Rolling through \"wildflower-blanketed canyons\" and shaded railway tunnels while overlooking Okanagan wineries delivers memorable scenery. Community. 3 out of 5. Good vibes. Riders actually talk to each other. Post-race gatherings feature local wines and beer where \"cyclists gathered at the finish line to share stories, swap tales of their journey.",
