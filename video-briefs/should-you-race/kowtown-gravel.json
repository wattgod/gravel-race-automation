Altitude. 3 out of 5. Moderate altitude. Worth acclimatizing for. Kremmling sits around 8,000 feet with climbs heading higher into thin-air territory through rolling mountain terrain. Adventure. 3 out of 5. This race takes you somewhere different. Remote ranchlands, rolling mountains, and 85% gravel through BLM territory delivers Colorado backcountry experience. Value. 3 out of 5. Reasonable price for what's offered. Expenses. 3 out of 5. Plan for a few hundred all-in. Logistics. 2 out of 5. You'll figure it out. Eventually. Parking split between West Grand High School and a separate K-8 lot suggests tight space management in a small town.",
