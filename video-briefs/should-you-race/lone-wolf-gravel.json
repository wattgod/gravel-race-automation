Length. 3 out of 5. Proper race distance. Enough to hurt. The 62-mile distance hits the sweet spot for most gravel riders, with 36, 50, and 100-mile options available. Elevation. 3 out of 5. Proper climbing. You'll earn your descents. The 4,000 feet over 62 miles includes what creators call \"chunky steep climbs\" in Michigan's Upper Peninsula terrain. Adventure. 3 out of 5. This race takes you somewhere different. Community. 3 out of 5. Genuine community feel. People stick around. Iron Hills Cycling Team promotes \"community and support among local residents of Dickinson County\" through cycling. Logistics. 2 out of 5. Functional. Not impressive. Start location coordinates provided (gravel pit off Sportsmens Club Road), but conflicting start times listed - BikeSignup says 9:15 AM while MGRS says 7:00 AM. Technicality. 2 out of 5.
