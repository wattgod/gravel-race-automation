Vandalia Community Center staging keeps venue costs low, with packet pickup Friday evening or Saturday morning for convenience. Length. 3 out of 5. Long enough to matter. Short enough to recover. Three distances at 24, 38, and 58 miles with staggered starts from 9am to 10:45am manage traffic flow effectively. Community. 3 out of 5. Good vibes. Riders actually talk to each other. \"People come back year after year because they fall in love with the vibe, the people, and the challenge. Logistics. 2 out of 5. You'll figure it out. Eventually. Pete Post praised race director Mark Wright's first-year execution: \"The volunteers were super helpful, the swag and race prizes were awesome. Technicality. 2 out of 5. Some chunky bits. Nothing catastrophic. Mann Road's \"sandy dirt uphill\" claims riders \"whose wheels get stuck, lose traction or topple\" right after the ski area descent. Elevation. 2 out of 5. Some ups and downs. Manageable. Called a 'roller coaster' course with 2500 feet of gain over 62 miles, which works out to manageable rollers rather than sustained climbs. Climate. 2 out of 5. Mild conditions. Nothing dramatic. March weather swings wildly—Pete Post raced through 3 inches of fresh snow in 2014 while 2025 saw 35°F temps.",
