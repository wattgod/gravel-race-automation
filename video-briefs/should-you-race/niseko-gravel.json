Enough vertical to remind you gravity exists. The 2022 Extra Long delivered 7,303 feet over 72 miles, while the Medium course provided 3,990 feet over 40 miles. Climate. 3 out of 5. Pack for two seasons. September 2022 brought perfect conditions—\"the weather could not be better\"—with gravel that was \"dry, fast, and chunky. Race Quality. 3 out of 5. Solid production value. Takeshita praises the organizer's course design: \"It was not monotone at all but very dynamic. Community. 3 out of 5. Genuine community feel. People stick around. Logistics. 2 out of 5.
