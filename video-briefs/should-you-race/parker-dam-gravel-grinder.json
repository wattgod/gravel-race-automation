Mild technical demands. Pick decent tires. Course described as \"relatively flat course for this part of the world\" by Pennsylvania standards, mixing gravel roads with paved sections. Elevation. 2 out of 5. Rolling terrain. Nothing that'll break you. 3,500 feet over 50 miles means steady climbing without massive punches - 70 feet per mile average. Climate. 2 out of 5. Weather cooperates more often than not. May 9th date in Pennsylvania means spring weather variability - could be 45 and rainy or 75 and perfect. Adventure. 2 out of 5. Light adventure. Nothing wild.
