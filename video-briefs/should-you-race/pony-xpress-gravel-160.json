Elevation gain that belongs on a trail run. 12,000 feet of gain over 160K puts this firmly in the hurt-locker category - that's 75 feet per kilometer of pure vertical punishment. Technicality. 4 out of 5. Bike handling matters here. Practice your descents. The course combines 96% gravel county roads with technical navigation challenges requiring GPS and handlebar-mounted maps. Adventure. 4 out of 5. The kind of ride you'll tell stories about. Riding through historic mining areas including the Ludlow Memorial adds historical context to the suffering. Altitude. 3 out of 5. Moderate altitude. Worth acclimatizing for. Trinidad sits around 6,000 feet with the course climbing into higher foothills, putting you in moderate altitude territory that affects sea-level dwellers but isn't devastating. Expenses. 3 out of 5. Mid-range expenses. Budget a proper race weekend. Trinidad offers affordable lodging options including Las Animas County fairgrounds camping at $25 per night with basic amenities. Logistics. 2 out of 5. Basic setup. Don't expect hand-holding. Tony Huston traveled from Houston with zero acclimatization and \"no real idea of what to expect,\" highlighting the minimal pre-race information available. Climate. 2 out of 5. Weather cooperates more often than not.",
