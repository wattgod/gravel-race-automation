Pack for two seasons. 50°F start to 75°F midday in May is nearly perfect gravel weather. Adventure. 3 out of 5. This race takes you somewhere different. Prestige. 3 out of 5. Respected. Not yet legendary. Part of the Colorado Gravel Grinder Championships series, but nobody's talking about it online. Race Quality. 3 out of 5. Solid production value. 90% gravel county roads through Las Animas County with proper feed stations and organization. Experience. 3 out of 5. You'll remember this one. Mostly fondly.
