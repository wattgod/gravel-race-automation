The hills sort the trained from the untrained. The Wolf Creek-McFarland climb alone spans 10 miles with \"horribly steep pitches, washed out road beds, and chonky bedrock to negotiate. Climate. 3 out of 5. Pack for two seasons. Historical weather data shows average highs of 69°F and lows of 49°F, with a 47% chance of rain on any given day. Adventure. 3 out of 5. This race takes you somewhere different. Cherokee National Forest delivers wilderness gravel with no course marking—just you, your GPS, and Tennessee mountains. Experience. 3 out of 5. The experience justifies the entry fee. Cherokee National Forest delivers the goods—8700 feet of climbing on the long route through terrain that's definitely not champagne gravel. Community. 3 out of 5. Community is a real selling point. Tennessee Gravel runs a proper grassroots weekend with camping, music, and beer at 155 Ellis Creek Road. Value. 3 out of 5. Reasonable price for what's offered. Two-day stage race format with camping included gives you solid weekend bang for your buck.",
