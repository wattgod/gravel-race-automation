Eventually. Chainbuster Racing cancelled the 2025 edition due to just 18 registrants, citing market saturation with three events in the same area within three months. Length. 2 out of 5. Manageable distance. Back by lunch. Technicality. 2 out of 5. Some chunky bits. Nothing catastrophic. 2000 feet over 55 miles suggests rolling Georgia terrain rather than technical challenges. Climate. 2 out of 5. Weather cooperates more often than not. Historical weather data shows average highs of 75°F and lows of 55°F, with a 41% chance of rain on any given day. Adventure. 2 out of 5. Mild adventure. Scenic ride with a number plate. The biggest adventure was whether the race would happen—it didn't in 2025. Race Quality. 2 out of 5. Adequate. Room for improvement. Race quality centers on what Jason calls 'the joy of community and camaraderie' rather than polished production values.",
