Train your climbing legs. The 15,000 feet over 300 miles creates relentless climbing rather than dramatic peaks. Climate. 4 out of 5. Weather is part of the race strategy. Historical weather data shows average highs of 83°F and lows of 63°F, with a 23% chance of rain on any given day. Experience. 4 out of 5. The kind of race that reshapes your season. The multi-surface format delivers unique variety requiring equipment strategy and surface adaptation. Community. 4 out of 5. The post-race scene is half the event. Chasteen puts major decisions to Facebook votes, creating \"buy-in for people who come to your event. Prestige. 3 out of 5. Respected. Not yet legendary. Chasteen draws inspiration from Burning Man culture: \"It's very Burning Man-esque with costumes and quirky weirdness. Race Quality. 3 out of 5. Well-run race. Professional touches throughout.
