Everything about this race is dialed. The three-lap format provides clean field separation while Simon Pellaud could ride \"30 kilometers solo at the front\" before being caught by chasers. Experience. 5 out of 5. This race ruins other races for you. Simon Pellaud noted \"Sea Otter is much more than just a gravel race — it's a true cycling festival. Community. 5 out of 5. Strangers become friends by mile ten. Ten thousand athletes across 14 disciplines creates cycling's biggest gathering. Field Depth. 5 out of 5. World-class athletes. And they race hard. Adventure. 4 out of 5. Remote terrain. Self-sufficiency required. The Start Section requires climbing \"out of the racetrack and onto half a mile of single track, then a fast but loose 3 mile descent. Expenses. 4 out of 5. Your wallet will survive this one.
