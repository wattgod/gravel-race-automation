This race takes you somewhere different. The first descent \"turn right into the woods\" leads to \"mostly doubletrack, singletrack, and FUN\" through forest terrain. Experience. 3 out of 5. You'll remember this one. Mostly fondly. Starting at Crystal Springs Sno-Park and mixing \"asphalt, dirt/gravel roads, with some double track sections\" delivers Adventure Gravel. Value. 3 out of 5. Fair value. You get what you pay for. No entry fee data available, but camping along I-90 keeps costs reasonable and you get Cascade wilderness suffering. Expenses. 3 out of 5. Standard gravel race budget. Logistics. 2 out of 5. Functional. Not impressive.
