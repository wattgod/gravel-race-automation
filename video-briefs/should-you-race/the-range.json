The hills sort the trained from the untrained. The classic Range route climbs 1,606 meters over 122km through the Porcupine hills, while The Frontier tackles 3,000m over 211km. Climate. 3 out of 5. Variable. Bring layers and a flexible attitude. Mid-July in southern Alberta typically runs 70-85°F with afternoon thunderstorm potential. Adventure. 3 out of 5. This race takes you somewhere different. Private ranch access through Burke Creek Ranch opens territory 'typically off-limits to the public. Race Quality. 3 out of 5. Solid production value. Over 50 directional signs mark the course with chip timing for overall rankings. Experience. 3 out of 5. Memorable course. Has character. Event founder Garth Stotts describes 'a celebration of Alberta's unique natural ecosystems where sustainable ranching practices have preserved this often-overlooked natural gem. Community. 3 out of 5. Genuine community feel. People stick around. Capped at 500 riders with camping available at Centennial Park creates weekend atmosphere.",
