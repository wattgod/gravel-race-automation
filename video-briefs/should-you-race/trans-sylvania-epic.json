Seven Mountains Scout Camp provides the central base with mandatory Stage 0 registration keeping everyone oriented. Technicality. 3 out of 5. Technical enough to thin the pack. Pennsylvania forests typically serve up rocky, rooty terrain with sustained climbs rather than explosive technical features. Elevation. 3 out of 5. The hills sort the trained from the untrained. The 15,000 feet over 225 miles creates what Mical Dyck calls \"constant false flats so you have to pedal through smaller rocks all day. Climate. 3 out of 5. The weather could go either way. Historical weather data shows average highs of 71°F and lows of 49°F, with a 49% chance of rain on any given day. Adventure. 3 out of 5. Genuine adventure elements. Expect the unexpected. Multi-day stage racing through Pennsylvania's forest systems with evocative names like Poe Paddy and Coopers Gap delivers backcountry exploration. Experience. 3 out of 5. You'll remember this one. Mostly fondly. Multi-day stage racing through Pennsylvania's Rothrock and Bald Eagle forests with named stages like Poe Paddy and Coopers Gap has potential for solid adventure. Community. 3 out of 5. Community is a real selling point. The \"Singletrack Summer Camp\" nickname captures the social atmosphere where riders call truces and \"just rode bikes and cheered on our fellow tryers.",
