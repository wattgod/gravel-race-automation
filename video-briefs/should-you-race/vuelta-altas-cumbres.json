Argentina's first UCI Gravel World Series event through the Traslasierra Valley's 'inhospitable natural setting' with crystal-clear rivers merging into Los Sauces. Experience. 5 out of 5. Once-in-a-lifetime course experience. Villa Cura Brochero to 2,270m through Achala Peak delivers pure Córdoba mountains immersion. Length. 4 out of 5. Double-digit hours are on the table. The 112km UCI course with 1,930m elevation gain hits that sweet spot where you're working hard but not entering ultramarathon territory. Technicality. 4 out of 5. Rocky, rooty, or both. Probably both. 92% dirt roads in 'varying states of repair' through what organizers describe as 'demanding technical challenges in unique, ever-changing, inhospitable natural setting. Elevation. 4 out of 5. Your power-to-weight ratio matters here. 1,930m of elevation gain with 35km of climbing concentrated in the first two-thirds makes this a proper mountain gravel race. Altitude. 4 out of 5. Thin air territory. Acclimatize or suffer. Topping out at 2,270m after starting at 900m is serious altitude that'll make you notice if you're coming from sea level. Community. 3 out of 5. Genuine community feel. People stick around. The weekend creates 'un punto de encuentro para deportistas, equipos y aficionados' with athletes from Chile, Uruguay, Paraguay, Bolivia, Brazil, and Ireland joining locals. Value. 3 out of 5. Fair value. You get what you pay for. 175,000 ARS (about $175 USD) gets you UCI World Championship qualification potential and 112km of Traslasierra Valley suffering.",
