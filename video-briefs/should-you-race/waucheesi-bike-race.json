Adventure. 3 out of 5. Genuine adventure elements. Expect the unexpected. Routes traverse Cherokee and Nantahala National Forests with 'amazing vistas' along the Cherohala Skyway and Bald River area. Experience. 3 out of 5. The experience justifies the entry fee. Finish line at Tellico Grains Bakery creates a community atmosphere where riders can cheer finishers while enjoying wood-fired pizzas and craft beverages. Community. 3 out of 5. Community is a real selling point. Finish line at the local bakery where riders gather to cheer finishers creates an intimate community feel enhanced by wood-fired pizzas and craft beverages. Value. 3 out of 5. Reasonable price for what's offered. Gets you 75 miles of Appalachian gravel with elevation for what appears to be reasonable regional pricing. Expenses. 3 out of 5.
