Enough vertical to remind you gravity exists. Starting from sea-level Yachats and climbing inland through forest terrain delivers substantial elevation change, with community reports mentioning 5000 feet total. Adventure. 3 out of 5. Adventure factor is real. The course delivers \"ocean waves and ribbons of gravel\" through Siuslaw National Forest on routes that have \"seldom seen a bike tire. Value. 3 out of 5. The math works out. Barely. The package includes custom medals, $14 food vouchers, fully stocked aid stations with Hammer Nutrition products, and drop bag service. Expenses. 3 out of 5. Mid-range expenses. Budget a proper race weekend. Logistics. 2 out of 5. Functional. Not impressive. Packet pickup ends at 8:30 AM for a 9:00 AM start, creating stress for mechanical issues. Length. 2 out of 5. Manageable distance. Back by lunch. Elite winner Austen Davis finished Erik the Red in 2:42:39, while the short course winner clocked 1:38:21. Climate. 2 out of 5. Mostly pleasant. Check the forecast anyway. Organizers report \"great weather 75% of the time\" over the past decade, but warn \"Always bring good rain gear when visiting the Oregon Coast!",
