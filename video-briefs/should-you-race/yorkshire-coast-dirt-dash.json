Logistics. 2 out of 5. Functional. Not impressive. Start/finish at YHA Whitby with electronic rider briefing and GPX files provided beforehand. Length. 2 out of 5. Manageable distance. Back by lunch. 73 miles split over two days with overnight camping - Day 1 covers 58. Technicality. 2 out of 5. Your road bike might survive. Might. Mix of singletrack, gravel paths, forestry roads through North York Moors with mandatory 45mm minimum tires. Elevation. 2 out of 5. A few hills. Nothing to lose sleep over. Day 1 includes approximately 840m of climbing, Day 2 adds 970m through North York Moors National Park terrain. Climate. 2 out of 5. Mostly pleasant. Check the forecast anyway. 2024 conditions were described as 'A very wet weekend' in rider footage. Race Quality. 2 out of 5. Nothing special about the race execution. Professional route design by Markus Stitz with support vehicle and provided meals creates solid event infrastructure.",
