Pico Veleta at 3,396m can drop to 5-10\u00b0C at night with potential freezing. 30-40\u00b0C temperature swings in a single day. Afternoon thunderstorms in mountains possible. Begin heat acclimatization 10\u201314 days before Badlands \u2014 20\u201330min sauna sessions or midday rides in full kit. Pre-load sodium 48 hours out. Target 500\u2013750ml/hr with electrolytes on race day. Race-day realities: Extreme heat in desert (40\u00b0C+).",

Expect 5\u201315% power reduction at altitude. Increase iron intake 4 weeks out. Hydrate aggressively \u2014 altitude increases fluid loss by 20\u201340%. Alpine cold at altitude.",
    "terrain": "Highly technical terrain at Badlands demands practice on similar surfaces. Ride desert gravel, alpine passes, technical trails at race-day cadence weekly. Expect: desert gravel, alpine passes, technical mtb trails. Practice cornering, descending, and power delivery on unstable surfaces. Dial in tire pressure before race week \u2014 5 PSI wrong costs you 15+ minutes over 497 miles."
