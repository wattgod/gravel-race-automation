Expect 5\u201315% power reduction at altitude. Increase iron intake 4 weeks out. Hydrate aggressively \u2014 altitude increases fluid loss by 20\u201340%. Dehydration and altitude stress; Long exposure at elevation compounds fatigue.",

Expect: rugged singletrack, alpine mountain roads, backcountry blm/jeep roads. Practice cornering, descending, and power delivery on unstable surfaces. Dial in tire pressure before race week \u2014 5 PSI wrong costs you 15+ minutes over 85 miles."
