Good years warm to 50s-60s\u00b0F. Begin heat acclimatization 10\u201314 days before Belgian Waffle Ride Cedar City \u2014 20\u201330min sauna sessions or midday rides in full kit. Pre-load sodium 48 hours out. Target 500\u2013750ml/hr with electrolytes on race day. Race-day realities: Dehydration risk once sun and pace pick up.",

Expect: 75% gravel/dirt, 25% pavement, playground-type sand sectors, fast ranch roads. Practice cornering, descending, and power delivery on unstable surfaces. Dial in tire pressure before race week \u2014 5 PSI wrong costs you 15+ minutes over 127 miles."
