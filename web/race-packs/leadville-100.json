Starts at 10,200 feet elevation; Columbine summit at 12,600 feet.",

Ride mixed mountain terrain\u2014singletrack, fire roads, pavement at race-day cadence weekly. Expect: singletrack, gravel roads, paved sections. Practice cornering, descending, and power delivery on unstable surfaces. Dial in tire pressure before race week \u2014 5 PSI wrong costs you 15+ minutes over 100 miles."
