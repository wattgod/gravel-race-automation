Dense forest canopy provides intermittent shade but traps humidity. Heat management is the defining climate challenge. Begin heat acclimatization 10\u201314 days before Lost River Classic \u2014 20\u201330min sauna sessions or midday rides in full kit. Pre-load sodium 48 hours out. Target 500\u2013750ml/hr with electrolytes on race day. Race-day realities: High humidity compounds heat stress during long climbs.",
    "nutrition": "Target 60\u201380g carbs/hour for Lost River Classic\u2019s 85 miles. Start fueling within the first 30 minutes \u2014 early fueling prevents late-race collapse. Bonking at mile 60 is a nutrition failure, not a fitness failure.",
    "terrain": "Highly technical terrain at Lost River Classic demands practice on similar surfaces. Ride technical appalachian gravel with constant elevation change at race-day cadence weekly. Expect: appalachian gravel roads, george washington national forest service roads, rocky descents with embedded rocks. Practice cornering, descending, and power delivery on unstable surfaces. Dial in tire pressure before race week \u2014 5 PSI wrong costs you 15+ minutes over 85 miles."
