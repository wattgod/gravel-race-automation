    "nutrition": "Target 60\u201380g carbs/hour for Ouray Gravel Grinder\u2019s 80 miles. Start fueling within the first 30 minutes \u2014 early fueling prevents late-race collapse. Bonking at mile 60 is a nutrition failure, not a fitness failure.",
    "altitude": "Ouray Gravel Grinder with 7,800ft of climbing, much of it above 8,000ft demands altitude preparation. Arrive 5\u20137 days early for acclimatization. Expect 5\u201315% power reduction at altitude. Increase iron intake 4 weeks out. Hydrate aggressively \u2014 altitude increases fluid loss by 20\u201340%.",
    "terrain": "Highly technical terrain at Ouray Gravel Grinder demands practice on similar surfaces. Ride mixed terrain at race-day cadence weekly. Practice cornering, descending, and power delivery on unstable surfaces. Dial in tire pressure before race week \u2014 5 PSI wrong costs you 15+ minutes over 80 miles."
