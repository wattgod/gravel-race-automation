Begin heat acclimatization 10\u201314 days before The Rift \u2014 20\u201330min sauna sessions or midday rides in full kit. Pre-load sodium 48 hours out.

Expect: black volcanic sand, sharp lava rock, loose highland roads. Practice cornering, descending, and power delivery on unstable surfaces. Dial in tire pressure before race week \u2014 5 PSI wrong costs you 15+ minutes over 124 miles."
