Expect 5\u201315% power reduction at altitude. Increase iron intake 4 weeks out. Hydrate aggressively \u2014 altitude increases fluid loss by 20\u201340%.",
    "terrain": "Highly technical terrain at Torino Nice Rally demands practice on similar surfaces. Ride mixed alpine terrain - paved cols, military gravel roads, rocky doubletrack at race-day cadence weekly. Expect: paved alpine roads, military gravel roads, rough doubletrack. Practice cornering, descending, and power delivery on unstable surfaces. Dial in tire pressure before race week \u2014 5 PSI wrong costs you 15+ minutes over 435 miles."
