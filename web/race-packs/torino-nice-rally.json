Ride mixed alpine terrain - paved cols, military gravel roads, rocky doubletrack at race-day cadence weekly. Expect: paved alpine roads, military gravel roads, rough doubletrack. Practice cornering, descending, and power delivery on unstable surfaces. Dial in tire pressure before race week \u2014 5 PSI wrong costs you 15+ minutes over 435 miles."
