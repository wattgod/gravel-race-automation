Temperature swings from below freezing at 11,000+ feet to 100\u00b0F+ in the desert. Weather changes rapidly at altitude. Wildfires and smoke increasingly common. Begin heat acclimatization 10\u201314 days before Tour Divide \u2014 20\u201330min sauna sessions or midday rides in full kit. Pre-load sodium 48 hours out. Target 500\u2013750ml/hr with electrolytes on race day. Race-day realities: Extreme desert heat in final sections.",

    "terrain": "Mixed terrain at Tour Divide requires surface adaptability. Include weekly rides on mixed mountain bike terrain following the continental divide to build confidence. Expect: gravel roads, forest service roads, blm roads."
