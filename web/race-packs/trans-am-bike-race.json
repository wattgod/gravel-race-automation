    "heat": "June in Astoria, Oregon to Yorktown, Virginia \u2014 June start means variable spring weather across 4,200 miles. Oregon coast can be cool and foggy. Rockies may still have snow at Hoosier Pass (11,542ft). Kansas brings relentless wind and potential dust storms. Missouri/Kentucky humidity builds. Virginia's Appalachians are steep, hot, and humid. Temperature swings from 40s in mountains to 100\u00b0F+ in Kansas plains. Begin heat acclimatization 10\u201314 days before Trans Am Bike Race \u2014 20\u201330min sauna sessions or midday rides in full kit. Pre-load sodium 48 hours out. Target 500\u2013750ml/hr with electrolytes on race day. Race-day realities: Virginia humidity and heat in June.",
