Temperature swings from 40s in mountains to 100\u00b0F+ in Kansas plains. Begin heat acclimatization 10\u201314 days before Trans Am Bike Race \u2014 20\u201330min sauna sessions or midday rides in full kit. Pre-load sodium 48 hours out. Target 500\u2013750ml/hr with electrolytes on race day. Race-day realities: Virginia humidity and heat in June.",
