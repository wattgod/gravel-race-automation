    "heat": "July in Across Europe (route changes annually) \u2014 The TCR is 'two races in one.' Alpine sections can hit near-freezing with storms, sleet, and snow at high passes. Then the Balkans and Eastern Europe bring 40C+ heatwaves, brutal sun exposure, and zero shade. Riders must prepare for 0-40C temperature range within a single race. Flooding, thunderstorms, and heatwaves are all common. Begin heat acclimatization 10\u201314 days before Transcontinental Race \u2014 20\u201330min sauna sessions or midday rides in full kit. Pre-load sodium 48 hours out. Target 500\u2013750ml/hr with electrolytes on race day. Race-day realities: 40C+ Balkan heat.",

Practice your exact race-day nutrition in every long training ride. Carry backup calories. 3100 miles burns 8,000\u201312,000+ calories \u2014 you cannot replace them all, but you must try.",
    "altitude": "Transcontinental Race with 210,000ft of climbing, much of it above 8,000ft demands altitude preparation. Arrive 5\u20137 days early for acclimatization.

    "terrain": "Mixed terrain at Transcontinental Race requires surface adaptability. Include weekly rides on predominantly paved roads, mandatory gravel parcours, variable surfaces to build confidence. Expect: paved roads, gravel parcours, cobblestones."
