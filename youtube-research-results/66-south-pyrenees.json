      "transcript": "This is a story of two friends going on\ntheir first adventure together.\nAlways snacking and yapping about\neverything and nothing.\nBrushing teeth. Well, fine, not always.\nMaking new friends.\nand somewhere between it all, riding\nbikes.\nEven out there in the wild, they\ncouldn't run away from doing laundry and\nmaintenance.\nBut luckily, they did manage to run away\nfrom horses.\nWell, you know, just all the normal\nstuff that one does when crossing the\nBernies.\nEvery good story begins somewhere. And\nour began in Catalonia.\nIt was Friday at 400 p.m. that we set\noff to cross the Pyrenees.\n2 weeks, 1,00 kilome and nearly 25,000 m\nof elevation gain.\n&gt;&gt; And I feel like I'm in jail\nand\n&gt;&gt; I asked Martina how she enjoys the\npennies so far.\nAnd just like that, the road became our\nhome and the panny's are playground.\n&gt;&gt; In the next two weeks, we will share\neverything together from unforgettable\nroads to toilets. So, we will for sure\nlearn a lot.\nWe didn't know it at the time, but it\nturns out that we cannot really get sick\nof each other, no matter how hard we\ntry.\n&gt;&gt; Come on down for the weekend.\ndidn't know if I could spare the\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's no longer dry and hot like it\nwas by the sea and I woke up with a sore\nthroat. So, we made a little trip to the\npharmacy.\nI lost count how many times we had to\nput on and off our rain jackets. But\njust like the cows, we continued on our\nway and we didn't really mind the rain.\nWell, not until the thunderstorm caught\nus on top of a mountain and suddenly the\nheatwave of day one didn't seem so bad\nanymore.\n&gt;&gt; Soaked to the bones, we found shelter in\na barn and a good company.\nThe sun came back eventually, but we\nstill chose to stay in a hotel that\nnight. A good call because the storm\ncame back even stronger and kept us\nawake for a good part of the night.\nBut at least this time we had cozy\nblankets and we were dry.\nSlowly but surely, we were moving away\nfrom the Mediterranean Sea and a little\ncloser to the Atlantic.\nThe pies are very diverse and they\nchange every day.\nWe decided to take a shortcut,\nwhich of course turned into a rough\nhiker bike.\nAnd as if having the flu wasn't enough,\nI managed to twist my ankle pretty bad.\nWell, it's one way of training my\nendurance.\nAt the end of the day, we pitched our\ntent near Mountain Refuge at a spot\ndedicated to campers, but also to\nhorses.\nWhat at first felt like a dream\neventually turned into a nightmare. The\nhorses got a bit too curious and started\nexaminating our equipment and rubbing\ntheir cute butts against marking a\nsingle bar. At 1:00 a.m. we were woken\nup by a horse knocking on our front\ndoor, kicking our front door.\nUnfortunately, we didn't have any place\nfor him in the tent. And well, between\nmy coughing and the horses galloping\nnext to our heads, we didn't really get\nmuch sleep. So big breakfast was a must\nand slow morning inevitable.\nEventually we said goodbye to our new\nfriends and terrorists by night and\nbegin cycling to Andura.\nWe decided to take a rest day in Andura.\nYou have forsen\nall the love you ten sleeping on a razor\nleft so far. Your body's aching. Every\nbone is breaking. Nothing seems to shake\nit. It just keeps holding on.\nAnyway, apologies for all this lovely\ncontent, but my runny nose was such a\nbig part of our adventure. Perhaps it's\nofficial soundtrack, so it didn't\nactually feel right to not include it.\nBut as it turns out, blowing my nose on\ncamera is really, really hard.\nFor once, we managed to get up quite\nearly. We enjoyed a breakfast buffet,\nstole some sandwiches for the road, and\nwe started climbing up to Port Caboose,\nwhich was our door back to Spain. Every\nman desires\neveryone.\nNo one left to harm.\nFor the past 6 days, I've been stealing\ntoilet paper in cafes around. And let me\ntell you, some are better than others.\nBoth a paper and a coffee.\nThere is no\nlove.\n&gt;&gt; We are back in the line of horses and\ncows.\n&gt;&gt; One must be really careful in the\ndescent because you never know when\nthere's a horse standing in your way.\nHeat\nup\nhere.\nIt's already been a long day and it\nwasn't over yet. We were discussing\nwhether to stay in the valley or push\nfor another big climb.\n&gt;&gt; Time flies differently in the Perennies.\nOne day can feel like many, but at the\nsame time, the days are timeless.\nWe got to the caban in the night, so we\ndidn't really know where we are\nsleeping. It was another very stormy\nnight. What a surprise to wake up to\nthis view,\n&gt;&gt; which I couldn't appreciate fully until\nI had my contacts on and my morning cup\nof coffee.\nWhat else?\nIt didn't take long until our neighbors\ncame to say hi.\n&gt;&gt; Probably wondering who are those\ntwolegged creatures peeing on the same\nspot as them.\nWe were hanging out for a couple of\nhours, but since we had no more food, we\nhad to leave at some point.\nIt was a quiet ride. Short but intense.\nWe were really hungry. A bit angry.\nLuckily, never at each other. So, we\njust kept being angry together.\nThis was a spectacular day. Big day.\nBut when the brain has so much beauty to\nprocess it all the time, the kilometers\npass quite fast.\nEven I felt better. still coughing,\nstill stealing toilet paper, but some of\nmy energy finally came back and I was\nable to be on the road again.\nThere are a lot of ups and downs,\nsometimes at different times for each. I\nwas feeling pretty great that day, but\nMartin, on the other hand, was feeling a\nbit stressed. We see the same places,\nbut we don't always experience them in\nthe same way.\nSo we can try to lift each other up and\nmeet somewhere in the middle.\nWhat Martina told me got stuck in my\nmind. In a way, I suffer a lot, but when\nit's for something you love, it doesn't\nreally hurt.\nThe last climb of the day took us to\nFrance, where we would stay for the rest\nof the trip.\nThen we ate delicious Vietnamese food\nand slept at a place with a washing\nmachine. Priceless.\nWe knew this part would be very\ndifferent.\nBig road climbs on the menu with\nlegendary tour of France names like\nperisut\nor obvisk.\nThe climbs we got the views on the\nsometimes. For 2 days we were riding in\nthe thick fog. Even in my memory these\ndays blur into one big cloud.\nWhat I do remember is that we ate really\ngood.\nThe clouds added a sense of mystery and\nsurprise. Even though it was wet and\ncold, it was truly spectacular.\nThere's something special about climbing\nall day in the gray and then suddenly\nbreaking through, discovering what's\nbeen hiding inside the clouds.\nlike lamas for example.\nWell, the best things in life don't come\neasy, but do we ever regret the effort?\naway from the first nation\nfor Jesus Christ.\nGet out my phone.\nI don't know.\nWe didn't leave our camp spot until 12.\nAnd by that time, our soul was wellfed,\nbut our stomachs were feeling\nparticularly empty.\ncrunchy\nseafood bey.\nYeah.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\nEvery night.\nIt was really hard to leave the bed in\nthe morning, but a smell of coffee\ncoming on from the breakfast room of our\nBNB eventually helped us out of the trap\nof comfort.\nThe breakfast was all sugar, perfect for\nme, not so great for Martina, who\nprefers salty. Lucky for her, it was\nvery hot these days, and we would start\nclimbing the second we go out of the\ndoor. So, she would get salty in no\ntime.\nAnd you\ncount the waves in every sailboat.\nFeel the breeze, the warm and moist.\nHear the sound. Just one big old\ncoming from the ocean.\nready.\n&gt;&gt; The third climb of the day was called\nthe money blanc.\nWe didn't know anything about this one,\nso we didn't expect much.\n&gt;&gt; But it felt like riding in a fairy tale.\n&gt;&gt; And you\ns\nwarm and moist.\nYou sound just one little\nWe arrived to the Bas country. A place I\nonce called home. And some part of me\nstill feels at home here. I don't know\nwhat's up with this place, but to me,\nthere is magic in the air.\nThe last time I'm doing laundry in the\nsink. I hate it, but when it's the last\ntime, I always become weirdly nostalgic\nabout it. about drying my underwear on\ntrees and chairs, which becomes part of\nthe freedom, part of this silly little\nlife on the road.\nReady\nforch.\nOh, you got to wait.\nOh, you got\nto go.\nProfessor\nmaking it up as we go along.\n&gt;&gt; As we are getting closer to the end,\neverything begins to calm down. Well,\nexcept for the gradient.\nWe take more time. We drink more beers.\nHalf waiting for the end and half\nwishing it would never come.\n&gt;&gt; For sure we are tired and we kind of\nwant to be done with it. But this trip\nit been so good.\nCan we keep this feeling? The one that\nonly life on the road awakened for a few\nmore days.\nWe are dodging sheep on the climbs and\nour hands are burning from breaking hard\non the steep descent.\nIt's hot.\nThe storm is coming\nand inevitably so is the end.\nI can't\nfind\nthis.\n&gt;&gt; It feels like a lifetime, but actually\nit's been only 2 weeks since we started\nriding west from the Mediterranean Sea.\nhopping between France, Spain and\nPandora.\n&gt;&gt; And today we reached the Atlantic.\nAnd just like that,\nwe have crossed the pennies.\nmaking it up as we go along\non the ground.\nI know nothing's wrong.\nYeah, that's the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\nNever money\nfor\nwhere I"

      "transcript": "- \"Ride a motorcycle in the\nSpanish-French mountains\nof the Pyrenees,\" they said.\n\"It will be amazing,\" they said.\n\"There will be fantastic\nviews,\" they said.\nSo I rode to the Pyrenees,\nnot only once, not twice\nbut for the third time.\nAnd this time, my journey to the Pyrenees\nwas the most challenging so far.\n(lively music)\n- Good morning from somewhere in Spain.\nToday we'll first hit the\nAutobahn for a little bit\nand then go to France,\nand go on to the Pyrenees\nbefore we probably cross back to Spain.\nThe starting point somewhere in Spain\nwas close to the mountain Gorbea\nand the Parque Natural de Gorbea.\n- Good morning.\nA new day of riding\nand hopefully a bit less\nfoggy than yesterday\nbecause today we go to a\ndestination I really love\nand that I have already visited twice.\nWe're going to the\nmountains of the Pyrenees\nat the border of France and Spain.\nBut first, we have to cover some distance\non bigger roads.\n(upbeat music)\nFrom our starting point,\nit was a ride of roughly 300 kilometers\nto the first outskirts of the Pyrenees.\n- Look, we are crossing\nback into France now\nbut don't you worry, guys,\nwe will ride along the\nborder of France and Spain\nthrough the mountains and\nvery likely cross back\ninto Spain at one point maybe tomorrow\nor day after tomorrow.\n- We're just making a\nbreak here on the Autobahn\nand next, we're going to\nLaruns, Laruns, Laruns,\nwhich is basically the start of riding\nthrough the French part of the Pyrenees.\nWe turned off the\nAutobahn at the city Pau.\nPau is a commune overlooking the Pyrenees,\nand part of the\nPyrenees-Atlantiques in France.\nAnd like I call it,\nthe gateway to the mountain\nrange of the Pyrenees\nbecause from here, the roads\nare only about to get better.\n- We're getting closer to\nwhere the real fun starts.\nHere in the back you can\nsee the first glimpse\nof the mountains.\nI'm looking so forward to\nbe back in the Pyrenees.\nThey are so pretty.\n- Behind me you can see the mountains\nand a lot of cars,\nand we are now going to Gourette,\nwhich is basically the first\nstop on this little tour\nthrough the Pyrenees.\n- So once you're here close to the town,\nI think it's called Laruns, Laruns,\nyou just have to look for\nthe signs to Gourette,\nwhich is the next bigger mountain town\nand continue the ride through there.\nHere you even see all the passes\nbecause some of them are not open all year\nbut now in August,\nof course, everything is perfectly open\nand possible to drive.\nOne of the best places to\nstop for lunch is Chez Trey\nin the small mountain village Beost,\nclose to Laruns.\nThe restaurant serves French food\nand is the perfect stop to\nenjoy the calm atmosphere\nof the small town.\n- Can't show you any local food\nbecause we were too hungry\nand couldn't take any\npictures of it before.\nAfter our very nice lunch,\nwe now entered the national\npark of the Pyrenees.\nAnd we will first drive to Gourette.\nAnd then continue all the\nway - the next I think one\nor two hours - through\nthe national park here.\n- Oh my God,\nthis is literally the\ntrip of blocked roads,\nbut it seems that we can\njust ride around this one\non a smaller road up here in town.\nFrom our side of the mountain,\nwe had a great view on\nthe spa town Eaux-Bonnes\nthat we were heading to next.\nEaux-Bonnes is a village\nin the west Pyrenees\nat the southern end of Valley d'Ossau,\none of the most important valleys\nacross the Pyrenees-Atlantiques\ndepartment.\nThe town center in Eaux-Bonnes\nis a large open square\nwith tall houses and\nhotels along both sides\nbuilt in the 1860s.\nOn a raised platform\noverlooking the square,\nthe casino was built in the 1870s\nand is an impressive example\nof Belle Epoque architecture.\n- So from here, this\nmountain village Gourette\nis very close and I\nreally like the ride here\nbecause the curves are\njust super much fun.\nGourette is located at\n1,400 meters altitude\nand it's probably not the\nmost scenic skiing town\nyou have ever seen.\nIt was a small upmarket ski resort\nuntil the 1960s and '70s\nbut then in the 1970s,\nthe over construction\nof less attractive buildings took place\nlike in many other resorts\nand Gourette quickly lost its position\nas number one skiing destination\nof the Pyrenees.\n- Now we're riding up a mountain pass.\nNormally you have a great view here\nbut it's all foggy.\nIt's still kind of beautiful with the fog\nbut I would have loved to\nshow you the view here.\n(tranquil music)\n- Look at this, how cool is this?\nExactly here we stopped when\nwe were driving to West Africa\nin 2019 and enjoyed the beautiful view.\nAnd yes, in 2019,\nthere really was a beautiful view.\n- Normally on this pass here\nare these huge bicycles\nthat I took a picture with\nevery time I drove by.\nBut now I think we maybe missed them\nbecause I couldn't see them in the fog.\nI don't know. Very sad.\nInstead of my beloved big bicycles,\nmy travel partner spotted\nanother obstacle on the road.\n(playful music)\n- Holy shit.\nThat was a cow.\nOh my God.\nIf that would have been\nstanding on the road,\nwe would have driven right into it.\nWow, you really see\nnothing in this fog here.\nBut when the fog finally\ncleared up for a little while,\nI tried to film as much as possible\nof the stunning surrounding.\nThe Pyrenees is a mountain range\nIt extends nearly 500\nkilometers from its union\nwith the Cantabrian mountains\nto Cap de Creus on the\nMediterranean coast.\nIt reaches a maximum\naltitude of 3,404 meters\nat the peak of Aneto.\nFor the most part,\nthe main crest forms a divide\nbetween Spain and France\nwith the microstate of\nAndorra sandwiched in between.\nFor this day, our destination\nwas only the French part of the Pyrenees.\nBut don't you guys worry,\nwe will cross back into Spain\nfor the next episode\nand tackle the Spanish\nside of the Pyrenees.\n- Wow, finally, no fog no more.\nI really hope it stays like this.\nThe fog is kind of draining.\nThe village, Argeles-Gazost,\nis situated in the heart of the Valley\nof the Great Sites,\nnear the National Park of the Pyrenees.\nIt is the crossroad\nbetween the mountain passes Col d'Aubisque\nthat were coming from\nand the pass Col du Tourmalet\nthat we were going to.\n- Now we are approaching Col du Tourmalet\nand I just hope the weather is better\nbecause it really offers\nstunning views up there.\nSo stay tuned.\nThe higher we rode, the\nmore fog there was though.\n- These mountain passes here\nare all part of the Tour\nde France bicycle race\nand you see this with all the paintings\nand messages here on the road.\nAnd I tell you,\nnormally, the surrounding of this pass\nis just absolutely stunning.\nBut now I'm very sorry,\nnot so much to see.\nTo prove this to you,\nI have some old footage\nfrom exactly this pass\nfrom the ride of 2019.\nUnfortunately, with a much worse GoPro.\nBut I think you can get what I mean.\nIt's really stunning.\n- The problem is not only the fog\nbut that the humidity\nin the air is like 100%\nso it creeps in everywhere\nand even though my helmet visor\nhas a pin lock\nand it's normally really\ngood in rain even.\nBut now it's completely\nwet outside and inside.\nIt's really hard to see\nand actually very cold\nbecause I sometimes have\nto put the visor up,\notherwise I can't see.\nIt's terrible.\n- So this is absolutely\nnasty weather now here.\nPhew.\nIt had already been a\nlong and exhausting day.\nAnd we would have stopped at any time.\nBut all hotels on our way had been full.\nSo we were heading to the town Arreau\nfor finding a place to stay.\nWe stopped at Hotel D'Angleterre\nthat looked absolutely lovely.\nBut they as well didn't\nhave any rooms left.\nSo I ended up using an internet platform\nto book a hotel room\nand it turned out that the only free room\nwas 40 minutes away behind\nthe next mountain pass\nin Bagneres-de-Luchon,\nalso referred to as just Luchon.\n- Good morning, everyone.\nHere you see our motorcycles\nand in the back, you see how nice\nand foggy it is.\nBut it will clear up and the\nsun is about to shine today.\nSo we're more lucky.\nAnd now I will go to a cafe\nand have some breakfast.\nLuchon is a commune and spa\ntown in southwestern France.\nThe inhabitants of the commune\nare known as Luchonnais or Luchonnaises,\nand Luchon has an abundance\nof buildings worth to visit.\nFor example, the Church of\nOur Lady of the Assumption,\nbuilt in 1847.\nOr the buildings of the thermal springs.\nThere are 48 springs in total\nthat range in temperature\nbetween 17 degrees\nand 65 degrees Celsius.\n- You're getting very French now, huh?\n- [Travel Partner] Ja.\n- So what are you having?\n- One milk coffee with a croissant.\n- And?\n- Cigarettes!\n- This was actually a\nvery lovely town to visit\nand stay in but now we're\nheading back to Spain\nand hopefully we will\nride some off-road today\neven though we're not\nreally allowed to do so\ndue to my travel partner's\nfoot. But we will see.\nI hope you enjoyed the\nride through the Pyrenees,\neven though there was\nmore fog than good views.\nGive this video a thumbs up\nif you joined the ride anyways\nand leave me a comment\nif you dislike fog too.\nI promise you though,\nwe will be done with foggy riding\nand the next episodes will spoil us\nwith beautiful sunshine,\nwith the best routes off the beaten track\nand old smuggler roads from Spain\nto the small country Andorra.\nTune in next Thursday\nto join the GOT2GO travel crew again.\n(motorbike roaring)"
