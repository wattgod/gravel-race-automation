      "description": "FROM THE RACE SERIES\n[When I first rode West out of Albia, I didn\u2019t know what to expect. I knew there were a number of Class B roads I wanted to travel along the way, but I didn\u2019t expect to meet acres of grass-fed cattle, beautiful views, river crossings, and even a short ride along the Historic Mormon Trail. It was spectacular and the opportunity to explore Monroe county left me thinking, \u201cHoly Cow this is cool!\u201d\n\nAlbia is a fairly hill route, but there are a lot of long descents and nice flats to help you recharge and get ready for the next Class B challenge. The start location at the Monroe County Fairgrounds has plenty of RV camping sites available!]\n\nPease check out our sponsor; with a 15% coupon for your recovery needs.\nhttps://realandnutrition.com/discount/mspodcast\nhttps://o-liv.com\n** gravel10 for a 10 percent discount on all o-liv.com website\n\n\n\nAlso, if you're not subscribed, please whack that button as it makes a difference for this channel.

      "transcript": "[Music]\nWe were supposed to be traveling for a\nyear.\n&gt;&gt; So, we just heard from this guy that the\nentire state peak, Pennsylvania, their\nwhole 911 is down.\n&gt;&gt; We're supposed to be going down to\nPennsylvania, Iowa. It's about 2 hours\nfrom here. We're going to haul a little\nbit and see here. We don't want to be\ntraveling in the RV in high winds\nand trying to figure out where to hide.\nSo, we're going to kind of wait without\nthe storm for another hour. We'll have\nto pick up our package in the morning.\nBut, we're going to wait play by ear and\nsee. And hopefully everybody out there\nis safe.\n&gt;&gt; Look at that. So, what are we making?\nWe're making West Indian ketigree, which\nis coconut curry rice with cod.\n&gt;&gt; What? What's going on?\n&gt;&gt; We're in a holding pattern. We were\ngoing to cook in the RV. I have\neverything out there and, you know,\nready, but the storms are a little\nunpredictable at the moment. So, we're\nholding tight here um until we have a\nlittle more information and feel good\nabout driving down to Alabia. Holy cow.\n&gt;&gt; Alia. Holy cow. You know, y'all are\ncoming along for cooking extravaganza.\nNot my special this time, but we we\nwe'll uh we'll keep the tubs on here so\nyou guys can see what it looks like as\nit's done.\n&gt;&gt; All right, step two. We're going to add\nour rice. Basmati or jasmine.\n&gt;&gt; What are we using?\n&gt;&gt; We're using basmati.\n&gt;&gt; Why not?\n&gt;&gt; Cuz it's so delicious.\n&gt;&gt; It is. I love basmati.\n&gt;&gt; We're a rice family. Um so we'll stir\nthat. Usually in a lot of the African\nand Indian dishes, you kind of cook the\nrice before you put the water in to\nsteam it. Got to remember how much.\nOkay, now we are ready to add the\ncoconut milk. Calls for one cup of\ncoconut milk, but who wants a partial\ncan of coconut milk? So, we do that. And\nthen we need 1 and 3/4 cup of liquid,\nwhich is pretty much spot on. So, we're\njust we're just going all coconut milk.\n&gt;&gt; Can't go wrong with coconut milk.\n&gt;&gt; We're going to add on the cod on the\ntop. And then we're going to top that\nwith frozen peas and cover it and let it\nall cook.\n&gt;&gt; And the cod's going to soak up some of\nthe\n&gt;&gt; We hope it worked last time. I think\nit'll work again.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we modified the recipe like Ivonne\nsaid. Well,\n&gt;&gt; easy. No stirring, nothing.\n&gt;&gt; Nope.\n&gt;&gt; Sits on top to steam. We'll set a timer\nfor 10 minutes and hope for the best.\n&gt;&gt; There's still a little liquid, so I\nthink I'm going to turn off the heat and\nleave it for another 5 minutes.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And then it's all done.\n&gt;&gt; Looks pretty good, Chef.\n&gt;&gt; Ready to chomp when we get there.\nWe're planning on going\nthat that way where it's a little bit\nlighter. Pass the horizon and the clear\nhorizon.\n&gt;&gt; We We hope it's nice over there, right?\n&gt;&gt; We're trying to thread the needle\nbetween a couple storms. What are your\nthoughts, Ara?\n&gt;&gt; I think we could do it. I think there's\na line between the storms. There's one\nin the south, one the north. And I think\nif we're lucky, we might be able to get\nit.\n&gt;&gt; We're right there. This is this is\ncurrent time. Then if I hit play, they\njust kind of\nwe're we're hoping to go right between\njust going to go\nlike that.\n&gt;&gt; You can't swap swap wheels easy.\n&gt;&gt; A little difference. And I think you\ncould make up that entire\nWe made it to uh Alier.\nWe're here. I think we might be able to\nget our pockets. We're a little bit late\nbecause of the storm, but we might be\nable to get our pocket. So, let's find\nout. So, how many bureaus do you have to\ntake out?\n&gt;&gt; I mean, there's a lot in this area. We\ncould have put a lot in. I I think we\nknew earlier this week that man, it's it\nwas going to be wet. So, we we've taken\n&gt;&gt; we've taken a little bit of a B- road\noff of the 50K completely.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; The 100K,\nyou've got a little tiny section. We\nwe'll be able to hike a bike it. I think\nwe'll be all right.\n&gt;&gt; We're we're we're having we're having\nour best men check it.\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n&gt;&gt; So,\n&gt;&gt; yeah, that's a that's a nice shirt.\nThank you. Look at this.\n&gt;&gt; Trying to keep those fun.\n&gt;&gt; They're hooking us up. They're hooking\nus up.\n&gt;&gt; Um\nbut we're here.\n&gt;&gt; Can't go wrong, right?\nWe at the uh county fairgrounds in in\nIowa. This law I think most of the\nMidwest is like this. Most of these um\ncounty fairgrounds are so nostalgic.\nSame same stuff. But it's always kind of\nlike you're always home wherever you go,\nyou know?\nThat's good,\n&gt;&gt; guys. I am ano about being level. pull\ninto this grass side and\nnothing nothing needs to be done. We\ndon't have to level nothing. So my\nbrain's kind of confused because in my\nmind I'm like, we got to level. But then\nI know it's level in there. So anyway,\nthat's that's a long story. We're here.\nWe're level. I don't know what else to\ndo. What do I do with all extra time?\n&gt;&gt; We get our bikes ready.\n&gt;&gt; Eat some food.\n&gt;&gt; That's true. Maybe go to bed early\n&gt;&gt; so we can be on time to the start.\n&gt;&gt; We got to get the internet uh turned on\nso that we can get the social media\nposts out there and get some work done\nalso. So, got to get that done. Let's go\non the roof.\nRachel walking around the campground. As\nsoon as we get there, she would just go\nand do a ritual and just walk around,\njust check it out, check out the\nsightes. But it's kind of wide open so\nyou could see where everybody's at. Not\na whole lot to it. Just camping at its\nbasic. You pull up, get a spot, set up,\nand your weekend starts. Yeah, we just\ntalked to the rest director and I think\nit's going to be a good ride. They took\nout some B- roads. There is a little\nhiker bike in one of the sectors, but\nyou know, as you guys just heard, they\nwere checking it out for us. But yeah,\nlet's, you know, we're super stoked to\nbe here. Salute.\nSee how frosted that is? This is what\nyou call a freezer door fashion. And\nit's going to go with this delicious,\ndelicious meal Ivan made earlier that\nyou guys saw.\nas we're cooking cod in there, peas,\nrice, basmati, and we're doing an egg\nfor extra protein because why not? Ivan,\nhow was the drive here?\n&gt;&gt; It was a little uh strenuous, and I was\njust the passenger. So, how I should ask\nyou, how was the drive here?\n&gt;&gt; Not bad. I had a great co-pilot.\nAlthough, you know, you had to figure\nout the navigation around the storm\nbecause that's what really\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. and I didn't have the best radars\nto\nget accurate information.\n&gt;&gt; This is the current state of of the\nstorm around us. This is it. This we're\nusing red omega. The only one to use out\nthere.\n&gt;&gt; Look at that. Right.\n&gt;&gt; Breakfast time.\nGood morning people. Okay, it is\nSaturday, July 12th and we are in Albia,\nIowa. Rain the all way here yesterday,\nso it's pretty early.\nSo, let's hope that the roads are not\ntoo bad. But anyway, with that, let's\nlet's take a look at the uh sleep\nstatistics and the training statistics\nand see if we're ready to ride. Take a\nlook at the numbers here, guys.\nTrading readiness. I'm not sure why that\nis. I can't tell you why it's that low.\nAt least the slips are decent. HRV is in\nthe garbage, so hopefully nothing worse\nis coming ahead.\nUh body battery is 85. So, if anything,\nthat there's at least tank. There's gas\nin the tank. So, that should help.\nGood morning. It's uh another race day.\nWe are in Albia for the Albia. Holy cow.\ngot kind of a\nfoggy start to the morning, but it is\nnot pouring, which it's been doing for\nthe last 12 hours or something. So,\nwe're going to ride or ride bikes. You\nhear the music? That's the start line is\nright over there. Got 12 minutes till we\ngo.\n&gt;&gt; Excited to have you start on this\nbeautiful I'll be a holy cow morning\nthis uh these events are not easy, but\nthey are worth it. Uh when we were\ndriving around last night at 10:00\nchanging the signs around, my wife and I\nlooked at each other and we're like,\n\"We're not normal people. We're not\nnormal people. This is not normal\nbehavior.\" And folks, you guys to to\nlook at the weather yesterday, to watch\nthe weather report, to get up this\nmorning, to come out and ride, look at\neach other. You guys are also not normal\npeople. You are exceptional people. So,\nthank you so very much for your\ndedication to this sport. Thank you for\nyour dedication to the Iowa Gravel\nSeries. Your\n&gt;&gt; marks, get set, go. Have a fantastic day\nout there. Stay safe. We'll see you\nsoon. Enjoy all 70 miles. We gave you\n15% more miles for free this morning.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, off we go,\n&gt;&gt; guys. It feels absolutely crispy this\nmorning. I think it's going to be good\nriding temperatures.\nMy bike is super clean, so it's going to\nget going need another wash after this.\nOff we go. I'm already in the back. It's\nnot a very huge group, so it's very easy\nto get off the back.\nHuh?\nI realized I was in last place.\n&gt;&gt; Oh no.\n&gt;&gt; Right away.\n&gt;&gt; Small group.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Casey.\nFastest of uh Alia gravel. And we're\nIvana and I are in last place.\n&gt;&gt; I think one person's behind us.\n&gt;&gt; One person is behind us.\n&gt;&gt; Maybe it's the sweeper though.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, there might be the sweeper then.\nAnyway, we're here to ride bikes. We got\nall day uh in the rest of them in the\nfirst mile. So, we're going to we're\ngoing to ride bikes and get hop on. We\ngot a cow stampede over there.\nI don't I don't know how any of these\nroads around here\nare. So, I don't know if they have skip\ngraves\nof cumber.\nI don't know.\nSo\nthat's the moral of this of the story\nhere.\nSteve Downs here.\nHoly cow. Wow.\nOff cumber rotting. Super rotted.\nWow. That was a crazy sketchy corner,\nbut it was worth it.\nThe first climb of the day. You can see\neverybody's here in slow motion.\nAll right, we survived. We already\nclimbed two hills already. Uh,\nnow we need these rollers. It look like\na a bit of a lot of fun.\nI might still catch those people up\nthere. Let's see.\n&gt;&gt; Welcome back. We are out. We are riding.\nI was the first one to the start line,\nbut I was not the first one off the\nstart line.\nI think I'm here in the back. I can see\na rea head and a few people. This is\ngoing to be one of those rides where\nit's hard to tell where people are cuz\nyou can't see far ahead through the\nhills.\nBut we're starting to see some of the\nHoly Cow views.\nLet's see if we can see him at the top\nof this hill.\n&gt;&gt; Turned around this corner and look at\nthis gigant hill.\n&gt;&gt; Good morning. You want to see the holy\ncow? Holy cow. We got hills.\nWe got pretty good conditions for the so\nmuch rain that's been coming the last\ncouple days. Little washboardy, but the\nfog cleared up. It's beautiful out. I'm\ngoing uphill.\nTrying to chase A up there. Well, that's\nnew. I've never seen donkeys hanging out\nwith the cows.\nThis section here is uber windy. I got\nmy head down\ntrying to stay low. Been chasing this\nguy for miles. See,\nthere's a couple more people around the\ncorner. This guy, I get close, I get\ndistracted, and he takes off. But I\nthink I'm going to catch him now. But we\nhave a maybe a group of five ahead of us\nthere. It's going to be a good chase.\nAll right. Cue the music.\n&gt;&gt; Nice bike, man.\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n&gt;&gt; I love it.\n&gt;&gt; Thank you. Looks absolutely stunning.\n&gt;&gt; How's How's your ride so far?\n&gt;&gt; Doing great.\n&gt;&gt; Enjoying it?\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Awesome. Good to hear.\n&gt;&gt; Wow. That was ripping.\nOh, into a master monster up here. Look\nat that, guys. Holy cow.\n306 in.\nAll right. See you at the top.\n&gt;&gt; You can maybe see, but I'm all by\nmyself. Uh, I feel pretty okay. Like I'm\nriding pretty well. There's a little\nwind, but people came ready to ride\ntoday. Ariel was up ahead\nand now he's gone. So, I guess that\nmeans if I find them in a feed zone, I\nhave to attack them there.\n&gt;&gt; We are still battling the wind.\nLuckily, there's a lot of uh trees on\nthis sector here.\nOh man. Yeah, this is loose here. Very\nhard to take this at full gas\nor full speed, whatever it is.\nAll right.\nYikes.\nMan, the checkpoint is eating up the\nlittle bumps. It's like they're not even\nthere. I'm slightly up the saddle,\nthough.\nOh,\nthis route is great so far. Lots of\nprairies, lots of forests,\nbeautiful weather, no complaints.\n&gt;&gt; Look at the views. I, on the other hand,\nsweating like crazy.\nAlthough I didn't find those people.\nThere's a group of about four people\nthere. join in. That would be\ngreat. Let's go to the music.\n0824.\nLooks like the next climb is coming up.\nClimb 606.\nThat's uh a lot of climbs.\nThat's the uh profile there. Can see why\nI don't want to talk to you guys until I\nget to the top right. It's a lot of\nwork. But check out the meadows over\nAll right, off to the top we go. Made it\nto the top with uh\nsome people still in sight. So, what's\nup, man?\n&gt;&gt; How you doing?\n&gt;&gt; Not too bad. How are you?\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n&gt;&gt; Hey, where you go?\n&gt;&gt; I like\n&gt;&gt; I think I know this guy,\n&gt;&gt; you know.\n&gt;&gt; I know it. You guys are too fast.\n&gt;&gt; Those heels, huh?\n&gt;&gt; The heels are serious, aren't they?\n&gt;&gt; Holy\n&gt;&gt; They didn't They didn't tell me about\nthat first.\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n&gt;&gt; That was insane. Guys, shout out to my\nbuddy Alex Lin. Let's go, man. See you.\n&gt;&gt; See you.\nHow's it going?\n&gt;&gt; Good. How are you?\n&gt;&gt; Not too bad. You having a good ride?\n&gt;&gt; I am.\n&gt;&gt; Where you riding from?\n&gt;&gt; Shannon, Iowa.\n&gt;&gt; Shannon, Iowa. Awesome.\nMan, this dino is bombing.\nSorry.\nHour and a half in, I realized I haven't\neaten anything since breakfast.\nI have a hard time eating in the\nmorning. Any else? Anyone else out there\nhave that? You wake up and you're not\njust\nready to eat right away? So, in the feed\nbag today,\nI've got few chips,\nuh, salt and vinegar today.\nUm,\nsome\num, kettle bites to start with.\nWe'll see how they do.\n&gt;&gt; Margaret,\nhow's it going?\nGood job.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Thank you.\n&gt;&gt; Snack time.\n&gt;&gt; One's water. This one has the carbs and\nelectrolytes.\n&gt;&gt; Awesome. Thank you.\n&gt;&gt; You're welcome.\n&gt;&gt; Catch up to you, Nancy. Watch out.\n&gt;&gt; I did. We did not.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, we got water now. We We keep\ngoing.\nOh, look at all those beautiful flowers.\nEven just stopping for a while for like\nI stop for maybe 30 seconds legs are\nlike dead.\nLet's take a moment to look at\nthe countryside in Albia. So this is\ncalled holy cow because of the the dairy\ncows in these hilllands out here. This\nis very suited to dairy farming is what\nI'm told.\nThis uh went from a mellow gravel road\nto a fun chunky B- road\nwith a lot of character. Lots of rocks,\nlots of loose stuff. Makes it really\nfun.\nThere the dairy cars\nover there.\nSo many of them\nall over here. Look at that.\nThis is chunky here, guys.\nI'm sticking to the right here. I'm\ngoing have to cut back.\nThere we go. Wow. Look at that.\nAbsolutely gorgeous.\nas we get pred up here on this ridge. At\nleast we got good views. I mean, look at\nthis.\nThis is Albia. Holy cow. I mean,\nwhichever way you look. I added this\nwind speed field on my Oh, look at the\nriver. Yikes. I added the wind speed\ndirection on my head unit. So, right now\nit's a 8.4 mile headwind.\nSometimes not good to look at that data,\nthough. The arrow bars are helping me\ncut right through the wind.\nA flat road for now. The roads have been\ngood, but here's some glimpses at\nhow much rain.\nNothing compared to the flooding other\nplaces so far.\n&gt;&gt; Okay. You definitely don't want to swim\nin there. Looks kind of inviting, but\nnot really. You don't want to swim in\nthere. It's too warm. Too many bacteria\nin there.\nWe're still rolling, man. I'm tired. I'm\nfeeling it. It's been really hilly, but\nI'm doing the best I can, but\nthe system is feeling it.\nThat That is the aerobic system. We got\n26 to go. Most of the work is behind us.\nThe last two miles are supposed to be\nreally painful. That's what they were\ntold.\n&gt;&gt; Daria texted maybe 5 minutes ago told me\nif I pass one woman, I'm on the podium.\nI don't know if that's possible cuz I\nhaven't seen anyone\nsince like mile two. So,\nlet's let's see what we can do. There\nmust be something delicious cuz there's\nat least 10 turkey vultures up there.\nOne this must be the head one. Gets to\neat first or something.\nCheckpoint number two has been wrapped\nup. 23 miles to go.\nstill feeling pretty good. Well, now\nthat the sun is behind the clouds,\nwe got three parrots out there. I don't\nknow that I'll be able to catch them,\nbut I'm pretty spent right now.\nBut I'll give it a shot.\nI'm still chasing those two down there.\nThey're just right outside of my reach.\nOh my goodness. This is wild over here.\nGorgeous.\nMaybe I'll catch him here.\nI'll report back if I make it.\nThis little section is a lady behind me.\nThere's a guy up here. And there's\nsomebody else in front of him. So, we'll\nsee if we're able to uh make any ground\non any of these guys. I don't think that\nguy wants me to catch him.\n&gt;&gt; Wow. Kind of ratty down here.\nOh my goodness.\nThe air feels like 20\u00b0 cooler. It feels\nso good.\nI can just go down like that forever. My\ngoodness, that felt good. 17 to go. So,\nit's almost over, but that's a lot of\nwork. It's a lot of work.\nGot a feel of dandelions over there.\nThis is a beautiful course, but you'll\nbe you can easily miss the the beauty\nbecause of the huffing and puffing as\nyou go up the hills.\n11 of 16. There's five climbs in the\nnext 17 miles.\nI got some terrible news. I am bigly\nbigly cramping. Oh my goodness.\nThat last hill,\nmy right leg\ngone.\nI am uh\nright now I'm focusing on grid and heavy\nbreathing.\nOh my god.\nI haven't gr in a while. So\nthat should make for an interesting\n16 mi to go\nupon the draft.\nSo, I'm going to let her give me some\nhelp here.\nI have 13 miles to go and less than\nhalf a bottle.\nSo, not good. I'm going to cross the\nline a little thirsty. I'm going to be\nfat. A little over an hour to go and\nintel is that there's few pretty big\nclimbs in the last section. I have I\nthink three or four more significant\nclimbs to go. So, still trying to push\nforward.\n&gt;&gt; Look at that.\n58 down, 10 to go.\nThere's two people up there. One has red\nlight and there's a third that just went\nover the hill. So that might be a Ria\nwith the light, but we'll see. I hope\nit's not a Ria. I want him to be at the\nfinish line already.\nI was right. There's Ria.\nAnother person ahead of him.\nCan I catch him? This sucking wind big\ntime. I got about nine miles to go,\nguys. She caught me.\nI tried. I almost got away, though.\nI almost got away.\nI'm out of water. You want some?\n&gt;&gt; You got water?\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for the water.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. I've been cramping the last 10\nmiles.\nAll your caught me and she's uh give me\na draft. I'm pretty sure she's going to\ndrop me on the next hill. But for now,\nI'm going to hang\nas much as I can.\nWe're just sending pretty fast here.\nCon sweats.\nCue the music.\nI got\nMan, I got zero snapping legs. Wow.\nI just passed two people. I've passed\ntwo women. But maybe if I can hold on.\nThat's the fairgrounds right up there.\nHalf a mile.\nWe made it to the finish. We got Jen.\n&gt;&gt; We We may or not be We may or may not be\nfirst and second, which that ever\nhappened to you?\n&gt;&gt; Um well, when they told me it was first,\nI was like, \"No, that cannot be right.\"\nSo,\n&gt;&gt; not damn. Maria texted me and said, \"If\nyou pass one woman, you might be on the\npodium.\" And I passed two. So, so I I\nsaw the second one ahead and I was like,\nI gotta try to beat her because in case\nhe was wrong,\n&gt;&gt; case he was wrong.\n&gt;&gt; In case I got wrong intel. So, we we\nmight we might be rocking the podium.\n&gt;&gt; Just limping through here to the finish.\nThank you.\nThat's hilly out there.\n&gt;&gt; A little hilly out there, huh?\n&gt;&gt; A little bit.\n&gt;&gt; Gravel.\n&gt;&gt; Oh my god.\n&gt;&gt; I was questionable whether I wanted to\ndo it or not. Um, but honestly, the\ngravel was in really good condition\nother than the chunky stuff. And did a\ndid only walked up two hills. Didn't\nthrow up, but I did cramp.\n&gt;&gt; And you podium.\n&gt;&gt; And I did podium. Yes.\n&gt;&gt; What was your podium position? Uh, first\n&gt;&gt; roll with Claire for like\n&gt;&gt; a a long time.\n&gt;&gt; I bonked.\n&gt;&gt; I ran out of water.\n&gt;&gt; Me too.\n&gt;&gt; My quad seized up Charlie horse style.\nSat on the side for a while really\ndebating my life.\n&gt;&gt; Then I found a nice old lady's house\n&gt;&gt; and she gave me water.\n&gt;&gt; Hey, you can't beat the Iowa nice.\n&gt;&gt; And that really just made it. And then\nmy brother just handed me pizza.\n&gt;&gt; Hey,\n&gt;&gt; that's a good day there, right?\n&gt;&gt; Everything's up up and up.\n&gt;&gt; What kind of pizza is that? That looks\npretty good.\n&gt;&gt; I guess it's Casey's taco pizza.\n&gt;&gt; Ooh, time for some recovery.\nNice\nhealthy dose of that.\nShout out to Reand by the way. Reland\nhas been a great partner of ours and\nthere's going to be a link in the\ndescription uh for a discount off uh for\nthe Gravel Gang family. Uh yeah, let's\ntalk. I'll be a holy cow. I'm gonna slam\nmy recovery because I I drank a lot of\nwater, but I think it was really really\nhot out there and I think I'm low on\nfluids. But so I got to hit my recovery\nso that I can speed up the process.\nLet's talk about our beer. I didn't\nbring my shaker.\nSo we're doing it the crude way. Um got\nthe milk in the way here, but we're just\ngoing to shake it. Shake it. Let's see\nactually how mixability is of this thing\nwithout a ball in it. Let's see how well\nit mixes. I got to shake it bigger. Oh,\nokay. I think it's shaking. You know,\nit's mixing pretty well.\nAll right. Looks good to me. Alia. Wow.\nI want to thank, by the way, uh I will\ngrab a series guys, everybody out there\nthat's making this the gravel series. If\nyou haven't checked them out, we'll put\na link in the description.\niOgraaser.com.\nThey have a bunch of races that you can\nsign up for packages for like a whole\nyear and sign up for all the races.\nReally interesting format here that they\nhave going on and a lot of that money\ngets donated to these local communities.\nSo what you know you can't that's that's\na hard deal to pass by. So grassroots\nevent there's you can ask for a whole\nlot more. They got food they had food\nthere for the finishers. Uh they had\nCoca-Cola the ice cold water. The\ncheckpoints were well stocked. Uh\neverything that makes a gravel race fun.\nUh that this is one of the more tre\nregions forested maybe is the right word\nin of Iowa. There's corn here still but\nthere's a lot of forest and it was\nreally pretty but you know you you kind\nof forget about it sometimes when you're\ngoing up those really steep hills and\nthe sun is just bearing down on you. But\nI give this a five out of five. I just I\ncan't knock him for anything. It's a\ngrassroots effort and they did\neverything to make the experience\nfun series fellas. Thank you very much.\nI want to thank Relearned\num for keeping the lights on and helping\nthe bodies recover after this crazy\nefforts. Um maybe I'll throw I'll throw\nmy ride numbers here. Great great race.\nUm we'll rec as you just saw we will\nrecap that. I'm not sure if I want to\nthrow this in the front in the back of\nthe video, but that's about it. Anyway,\nuntil next time."
