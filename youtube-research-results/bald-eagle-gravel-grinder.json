      "transcript": "Just like many other craze players\ngrinding levels to climb the server\nrankings, this young man also scrambled\nto join the Chin continent. But as fate\nwould have it, during one login attempt,\nthe young man was electrocuted and\ntransmigrated straight into the Chin\ncontinent, becoming Sibbin, an important\ncharacter in this world. It was just a\npity that Sibbon was an evil boss whose\nhead everyone and their mother\ndesperately wanted because he was cruel,\ntyrannical, brutally despotic, massacred\nthe common people and was also debauched\nbeyond measure, even humiliating Saint\nVu whom everyone revered causing her to\neventually take her own life out of\nextreme humiliation. The protagonist\nhimself before transmigrating here was\nthe vanguard leading the army to fight\nthe boss. After defeating Sibbon, he\neven landed a sword strike on his\nmanhood as revenge for the girls he had\nharmed. Yet times changed too quickly.\nThe dragon slaying youth got\nelectrocuted and became that very evil\ndragon. His life began once again for\nwhen he was still crying in his father's\narms. He seemed very proud to have this\nson and gave him the name Sibin of the\nGolden Lion family. After getting his\nnew identity, Sibbon was always haunted\nby the old plot. He swore that he would\nlive a decent life, become a good lord,\nand love his people so that those\nplayers wouldn't come looking to settle\nscores. After transmigrating, Sibbon\nalso activated a system, but this was\nthe strongest villain system. Sibbin\nvehemently refused. He didn't want to be\na villain at all, but the system\nreminded him that he was a boss destined\nto die. Even though he had transmigrated\ninto this body, Sibbon couldn't change\nthe main plot on his own. In other\nwords, he couldn't change the original\nowner's personality from a tyrannical\nlord into a good person. The only way to\nhelp Sibbon escape his fated death was\nthrough the systems help by continuously\nincreasing his power, pushing the wheel\nof fate, and avoiding being hanged by\nthe players. Sibbin was speechless. He\nhad transmigrated into a game only to\nend up as someone destined to die. Could\nhis life get any unluckier? If that was\nthe case, his only option was to bind\nwith the system. After all, he still\nwanted to live. The system was quickly\nand successfully bound to Sibbon.\nAfterward, he was informed that he\nneeded to complete a series of\nvillainous scenario quests such as\nhumiliating the saintists, slaughtering\nplayers, collecting subhuman female\nslaves, and so on. After completing the\nquests, he would receive rewards and the\nright to draw for functional rewards.\nSibbon thought about the scenario of\nhumiliating the saintists and then\ncollecting those female slaves, and his\ncheeks flushed red. It really wouldn't\nlet him do anything remotely human and\neven forced him down the path of a\nvillain. He verbally expressed disdain,\nbut just thinking about it made Sibbon\nso excited he started drooling. However,\nwasn't in the plot that Lord Sibbin was\nexecuted by the players after doing\nthose immoral things. He didn't want to\nbe like the original owner of this body.\nHe also didn't want to kick the bucket.\nBut the system reminded him that if he\nrefused the quests, he wouldn't get any\nrewards. At the same time, that damned\nsystem also presented Sibbon with three\nfuture outcomes. First, being physically\ncastrated by players. Second, being\nforced to turn into a lowly. Third,\ndeath. The more Sibbon listened, the\nworse his expression became. There\nwasn't a single bright path. This damn\nsystem was clearly messing with him. Sib\nfelt his life was at a dead end.\nStruggling would lead to death, and\ndoing nothing would also lead to death.\nHe might as well live one day at a time\nand see if he could find a way to escape\nfrom this adversity. Outside, the butler\nwas frantically knocking on Sibbon's\ndoor now that he mentioned it. Today, he\nhad a horseback parade through the\nstreets to present himself to the people\nas the new lord of this territory.\nSibbon dutifully performed his role, but\nhe felt no joy in his heart. Sibbon felt\nlike he was now a monkey in a zoo. The\npeople were constantly pointing. While\nhe had absolutely no ability to resist\nhis fate, Sibbon wore the dejected face\nas he made a round through the square\nthen returned to his palace to\nofficially present himself to the\npeople. At this point, it wasn't yet\ntime for him to become the cruel tyrant\nreviled by thousands. So, the people who\ncame to see the new successor lord all\nchanted in unison the four words, \"Long\nlive the lord.\" After the long and\ntedious ceremony, Sibbon was finally\nreleased back to his room. He was so\ntired it felt as if his limbs no longer\nbelonged to him. But he hadn't rested\nfor long before the series of villain\nquests was sent over. This meant Sibbon\nwouldn't be at peace for much longer.\nAnd the content of these quests was also\nvery ridiculous. First was to snatch a\nlollipop from a child. Next was to\ntrample a citizen's vegetable garden.\nFinally, to hang up an innocent commoner\nand beat them. Sib felt these quests\ndidn't resemble those of a tyrannical\nlord, but more like those of a hooligan.\nBut the system said that because these\nwere newbie quests. They were this easy.\nIt wouldn't be so easy later on and he\nshould understand and cherish it. After\ncompleting each quest, Sibbon would get\na chance to draw a prize. After\ncompleting all three quests, the\nprobability of receiving a special\nreward would be unlocked. Although he\nstill appeared indifferent on the\nsurface, Sibbon was actually craving\nthose rewards. Well, since life was\npushing him in this direction, he was\nforced to become a villainous bastard.\nAnd so without even taking a rest, he\nrushed out of his room. The dedicated\nbutler was currently polishing a\ntreasured sword. Sibbon enthusiastically\nwaved at him. Come, let's go patrol the\nterritory with your lord. Sib rode a\nvaliant red horse, eagerly galloping out\nof the castle, a very dangerous smile\nconstantly on his face. Based on his\nmany years of experience serving the\nyoung master, the butler immediately\nfelt that something was not right.\nSibbon's first target was a chubby kid.\nThis child had also come to watch his\ncoronation ceremony earlier. Both of\nthem still remembered each other's\nfaces. Sibbon approached him with a\nbusiness-like smile. Since you know I'm\na lord, doesn't that mean everyone has\nto listen to me, right? The kid nodded,\nsaying yes. You couldn't blame him for\nbeing so easily swayed. Children are\ninnocent. They say whatever they think.\nImmediately after, Sibbon switched to a\nsweet, coaxing tone. In that case,\nlittle friend, can you give me the candy\nin your hand? This child was only a few\nyears old and had no idea what the\nconsequences of defying the Lord would\nbe. The candy in his hand was like a\ntreasure. Therefore, even if there were\n10 lords here, he wouldn't agree. Sibbon\nhad expected this reaction, so he\nchanged his tune, putting on a face like\nthe boogeyman while growling out each\nword, \"Give it to me.\" The kid was\nterrified and immediately started\nwailing. The thing Sibon hated most was\ndealing with kids throwing a tantrum\nwith tears and snot everywhere like\nthis. even though he was the one who\nmade him cry in the first place. Sibbin\nthen promised the kid that if he gave\nhim the candy, he would immediately give\nhim two in return. Before the other\nparty could even agree, a simulation\nscreen appeared before Sibbon. Bing host\ndon't think the system is a fool, of\ncourse. So, he couldn't bend a rules to\nboth complete the quest and maintain his\nimage as a kind and benevolent lord in\nthe eyes of his people. However, the\nquest still needed to be completed.\nTherefore, Sibbon resorted to forceful\nmeasures, decisively snatching the\nlollipop away. The kid fell to the\nground, flailing about ceaselessly\nbefore the astonished eyes of the butler\nand the soldiers. Sibbin's mood wasn't\ngreat either. He felt that this quest of\nsnatching candy from a child was even\nmore humiliating than teasing the\nsubhuman girls. The next quest was to\ntrample the people's crops. Sib chose\nthe most fertile plot of land where the\ncrops were at their lushest. The owner\nof the field was even basking in the joy\nof an impending bumper harvest. And yet\nSibbon led a group of cavalrymen to\ndismount, and they all competed to\ntrample on it. The man who seemed to be\nthe captain of his cavalry unit was\nutterly bewildered and turned to ask the\nbutler, \"What on earth is wrong with the\nLord?\" \"Don't ask me. I don't know\neither.\" Only when the farmer's crops\nwere completely destroyed did Sibbon\ncontentedly withdraw his men. Seeing the\nfarmer's pained expression as his crops\nwere destroyed, Sibbon couldn't bear it\neither. He planned to secretly\ncompensate him later after returning to\nclaim his reward. The first two quests\nwere complete, but the final one gave\nSibbon the biggest headache. He didn't\nknow how to handle it smoothly. How\ncould he just hang up an innocent\ncitizen for no reason and beat them? Top\nquality subhuman female slaves,\nreasonable prices here, first come,\nfirst served. While he was lost in\nthought, a voice struck Sibbon's ears.\nAs fate would have it, just when he was\nat a dead end, he came across a man\nhawking subhuman female slaves on the\nmain street. It seemed a godsend\nopportunity had truly arrived. The\nmoment he saw him, Sibbon flashed a\ncunning smile, thinking to himself that\nit was lucky this unfortunate fellow had\ndelivered himself to his doorstep. And\nso he was hung up and beaten just as the\nscript required. The reason given was\nthat the new lord had issued a new\ndecree. humans and the subhuman race\nmust live together in peace. And from\nnow on, Lambdong City would not allow\nanyone to illegally trade subhumans.\nThus, Sibbon not only completed the\nquest, but also moved those subhuman\nfemale slaves to tears. They all felt he\nwas so compassionate and benevolent.\nHaving someone like him as their lord\nwas a blessing for 18 generations of the\nsubhuman race. Even the other citizens\nwho gathered to watch felt that Sibbon\nwas wonderful. Everyone who passed by\nhad to stop and applaud. After\ncompleting all three quests, Sibbon\nhastily returned to the palace and took\noff his cumbersome cloak. He demanded\nthe system let him spin for his reward.\nImmediately, a spinning wheel appeared\nin front of Sibin, and this time he\nreceived a set of perfect armor with the\nlong convoluted name shattered dragon\nheavy armor plate. Moreover, because he\nrequested the reward only after\ncompleting all three quests, Sibbon also\nreceived three extra chances for a\nreward critical hit. As a result, his\nperfect armor successfully got a\ncritical hit and was upgraded to the\nhero triumphant saint knight hero plate\nmail. Although he didn't know what it\ndid yet, but Sibbon only needed to hear\nthe words critical hit and hero to know\nthis was a rare treasure. He immediately\nequipped it, then wanted to find someone\nto test the capabilities of this new\nequipment. Sibbon went to the training\nground and ran into the butler, Crimin,\nwho was practicing his swordsmanship\nthere. He seemed surprised to see the\nyoung master, who is usually as lazy as\na demon, voluntarily show up here today.\nNot only that, but Sibbon also\nproactively suggested having a match\nwith Crimin, reasoning that he had just\nacquired a decent set of armor. It was\nthen that the butler noticed his\nmaster's armor, which was shimmering\nwith a golden light. This was the first\ntime in his life Crimin had seen such a\nmagnificent suit of armor. This armor of\nyours can't be described with just the\nwords, \"Not bad. It's truly too\nwonderful.\" Afterward, the two quickly\nstood on opposite sides of the training\nground. Crimin would personally helped\nthe young master test the armor, this\nnew armor. After greeting his opponent,\nhe immediately rushed towards Sibbon.\nDon't underestimate Crimin just because\nhe's old. Although he was a butler, he\nwas in fact also a great knight. Seeing\ncrimin speed with his own eyes, Sibbon\nalso felt immense pressure. He took a\nstep back to assume a defensive stance,\nthen raised his sword. The moment the\ntwo swords clashed, Sibbon was a bit\nunsteady on his feet, but Kerman was\nknocked back. He had to use his feet as\nbreaks, and it took quite a bit of\neffort for him to stop. It seemed\nSibbin's strength had improved a lot. He\nwas no longer the useless young master\ncrimin once knew. On the opposite side,\nSibbon was extremely excited to see that\nhis strength had indeed improved. The\ntwo continued to fight with Crimin\nmostly on the attack while he only\ndodged and evaded the blows. But that\nwas not simple at all, as his attacks\nwere both fast and sharp. The two fought\nfrom the afternoon until evening. Both\nwere exhausted, but Crimin still had to\npraise him profusely. The young master's\nnew armor, combined with your own\nstrength, its defensive effectiveness is\ntruly first rate. It's because you went\neasy on me, Sibbon replied modestly. But\nin reality, he was so pleased he was\ngetting a big head. He even carried that\nfeeling of elation into his dreams that\nnight. Sibbon dreamed that he had\nunparalleled strength, single-handedly\ndefeating an entire army of knights and\nwas even showered with praise by\nbeautiful subhuman girls as well. In\nthat dream, Sibbon also dreamed that he\nwas lying in a gaming pod for a virtual\nreality game and saw himself in the\nworld of Chian continent. This scene was\nfar too terrifying. So, he woke up with\na start. Suddenly, that moment gave\nSibbon a bad premonition. He felt as if\nhe was being watched by someone. Just as\nhis emotions were starting to settle, a\nsimulation window suddenly appeared\nbefore him, scaring Sibbon out of his\nwits. On it was a short notification.\nThe players are preparing to come to\nDivine Light Town. Wait, Divine Light\nTown? That name left a rather strong\nimpression on Sibon. He suddenly\nrecalled a war between the goddess of\nthe wild, Malin, and the god of war and\nflame, the flame dragon Ba. Malin was a\ngoddess with lower tier power, while\nBana was a god possessing mid-tier\npower. Therefore, this war was\nunbalanced from the very start. In the\nend, Malin was crushed in Bana's palm,\nand her divinity was shattered. Bono was\nalso certain that the subhuman race she\nprotected would eventually be\nannihilated. That was the first step\nthat led to the subhuman race falling\ninto slavery. Sib also remembered that a\nstrange man had given the game's\nprotagonist a blue crystal. He said that\nthis item had the power to summon heroic\nspirits and that the young man had to\ntake it to save the subhuman people and\nend the endless oppression against them.\nThese fragmented memories were all from\nthe early stages of the game. It was\njust a pity that back then, Sibbon never\ndreamed he would transmigrate into Chian\ncontinent. So, he had skipped quite a\nlot of the introductions. But based on\nthose pieced together recollections,\nSibbon could roughly guess that after\nthe goddess of the wild's divinity\nshattered, she used her final strength\nto condense it into that mysterious\ncrystal. Afterward, that item was given\nto the game's protagonist by a\nmysterious character. This mysterious\ncrystal was equivalent to the game's\nlogin client, and the heroic spirits the\nprotagonist summoned through the crystal\nwere the players. At first, when he was\nstill a player, Sibbon didn't feel there\nwas anything wrong with this plot point.\nBut now that he had transmigrated into\nthe game and thought it over carefully,\nhe felt that this world was\nfundamentally not just a game. It was\nvery real and there was a high\nprobability that these plot points were\nin fact the truth. and he was someone\nwho had been summoned from Earth by a\ndeity. That villain system was also sent\nalong by the one who had summoned him.\nBut as for that person's purpose, Sibin\ndidn't know. He just felt that despite\nhaving no talent whatsoever, he could\nstill become a pawn of a deity. It\nsounded a bit self-deprecating, but this\nwas truly the highest supreme glory.\nSeeing Sibbon muttering in the back,\nCrimin, who was driving the carriage in\nfront, finally couldn't hold back his\ncuriosity and asked, \"Young Master\nSibbon, this old servant has a question.\nWhy did you wake up so early today and\neven take a carriage to Divine Light\nTown on the border of Eagle Crest\nterritory?\" \"Of course, it's to save my\nlife,\" Sib thought to himself. But he\ncouldn't say these words out loud, so he\nstarted making things up. I want to\nobserve my territory a bit. Mainly, I\nwant to pay a surprise visit to the\npeople. So let's start from Divine Light\nTown, the most remote border town.\nSeeing the young master being so mature,\nCrimin was so happy he couldn't stop\nsmiling, he felt that after becoming a\nlord, Sibbon was becoming more and more\nunderstanding and reasonable. In that\ncase, the people in the territory would\nsurely feel happy as well. But he also\ndidn't forget to remind Sibbin not to be\ntoo shocked after arriving at Divine\nLight Town. Because the scenery here was\nextremely dilapidated until the flying\ncarriage pulled by that giant eagle\nlanded. Sib still couldn't believe that\nwhat was in front of him was Divine\nLight Town. The name sounded grand, but\nthe place was so dilapidated. What kind\nof job did the previous lord do? Even if\nthe land is barren and far from the\nroyal capital, he shouldn't have turned\na part of the territory into such a\ndump, right? Sibben roared in anger.\nSeeing the young master so indignant,\nCrimman couldn't help but speak up to\nenlighten him a bit. The previous lord\nwas Count Kalani of the Iron Wall\nfamily. He was a fanatic of the God\nflame Dragon B. So during his tenure,\nKalani was always off fighting battles\nand fighting battles, completely\nuninterested in managing his territory.\nIn his memories, Sibbon remembered\nKalani as a fat uncle who was always\nlaughing heartily. He didn't expect that\nsuch a gentle-looking man would be of\nthe wararmongering type. Um, actually,\nthe previous area of our Eagle Crest\nterritory wasn't so large that we needed\nto use flying beast to travel like we do\nnow, Crimin said. Are you saying I\nshould thank him for giving me an\nexpanded version of Eagle Crest\nterritory? Sibbon retorted. But before\nCrimin could say another word, Sibbon\nheard a commotion nearby. He followed\nthe noisy sound and found a group of\nkids frantically beating up a little\nhalfhuman half squirrel subhuman girl.\nAs they beat her, they relentlessly\ncursed the little girl, calling her a\nlowly mongrel and telling her she should\njust hurry up and die. At that moment,\nSibbon wasn't the only one witnessing\nthis unsightly scene. Coincidentally,\nthe protagonist of Chin continent and a\nsubhuman girl were also passing through\nthe alley at that time. That girl was\nextremely anxious seeing one of her own\nkind being tormented like that. But the\nmale protagonist didn't let her\nintervene because he was afraid her\nidentity would be exposed. He wanted to\nwait until the heroic spirits had\ncondensed to save all the subhumans in\nDivine Light Town. Do you want to save\nthis one subhuman or all the subhumans\nin the town? Although this guy wasn't\nwrong, the girl still couldn't bear the\nsight of her kin being tormented right\nbefore her eyes. While she was still\nhesitating on how to resolve this\nsituation, Sibon had already stepped\nforward before them. What are you doing?\nStop it. His loud shout forced those\nvicious kids to stop. The male\nprotagonist pulled the subhuman girl\ninto a corner to observe. As for Sibbon,\nhe had absolutely no intention of\nforgiving these kids. Therefore, he\nimmediately applied the rule of the\nright hand. After spanking there, but\nuntil they were red as flowers, Sibbon\nfinally stopped. As he picked up the\nlittle subhuman girl and left, he\nunintentionally walked past the\nprotagonist. The system immediately\nissued a warning that Sibbon had\ndiscovered an important player nearby.\nThe temporary system was also\nsuccessfully upgraded and had many new\nfunctions. Sibbon checked it out. The\nmost impressive new function was\ninformation data visualization. In other\nwords, he could now see other people's\ninformation. It was just that the\ntargets he could inspect were only those\nwhose level was equal to or lower than\nhis own. Sibbon could also use it to\ncheck his own information. He currently\nheld the status of account and was also\nthe lord of eagle crest territory. His\nstrength was equivalent to a level 43\nearth knight. Sib also possessed a bunch\nof skills. His reputation in the cologne\nempire was quite high at 999 points. And\nafter the incident of hanging that slave\ntraitor up to be beaten, he was also\ngradually gaining a reputation with the\nsubhuman forces. Sibbon was very\nsatisfied to know he was a famous\nperson. But when he looked at Crimin, he\nsuffered a serious blow. Because this\nold man not only had a higher level than\nhim, but his reputation in the Cologne\nEmpire was as high as 13,721\npoints. Sib felt as if he had suffered a\nblow that pierced his heart. Why did his\nbodyguard have a higher reputation than\nhim? Putting that matter aside, Sibbon\ncontinued to check the other functions.\nThe second one was called harvest chains\nof fate specifically. Each time Sibbon\nescaped a fatal outcome, he would obtain\none chain of fate. Although Sibbon\ndidn't know what this thing was\nspecifically, it sounded strange. But\nthe most important issue right now\nwasn't this thing called the chains of\nfate, but the mission at hand. He had to\nbring back the subhuman saint Zooie Y\nand humiliate her. Sibbin felt cold\nsweat break out all over his head. Sis\nRouue was one of the biggest reasons the\nplayers rose up to hang Lord Sibbon when\nhe was one of those players. He even\nvolunteered to castrate him. Just\nthinking back on it now was enough to\nmake him shiver. Perhaps understanding\nSibbon's confusion. The system later\nexplained to him what the so-called\nchains of fate were. This item was used\nto seal the fate line of the child of\nfate, Yiha, who is the protagonist and\nthe summoner of the other players.\nYiha's fate line has five branches,\nmeaning Sibbin must escape death five\ntimes and collect five chains of fate to\ncompletely seal and eliminate Yihow. But\nbefore that, he is not allowed to attack\nhim under any subjective thought. As the\nchild of fate, Yiha will receive the\nprotection of the rules in this world.\nIf Sibbin hastily launches an attack,\nhis identity might be exposed. Then\nYihow will directly target him, leading\nto the collapse of the world. Apart from\nE-How, Sibbon can freely attack other\nplayers to ensure his own survival rate.\nSibbin was quite satisfied and found\nthese rules reasonable. Aside from not\nbeing able to act against E-How, he\nstill had quite a lot of authority. And\nas the villain protagonist, how could he\ncrush the righteous protagonist who was\nstill in his budding stage? This was not\nin line with the rules at all. The first\nstage of the main story line has been\nunlocked. Now, Sibbon can view it on the\nsystem at any time. And if Sibbon\nremembered correctly, the mask girl with\nyeh how earlier was Saintis Rueer. With\nhis and the heroic spirits help, the\nSaints began to gradually take in and\nrescue the subhumans wandering\neverywhere on the border. But on one\noccasion, while the heroic spirits were\nrescuing a subhuman from a slave owner,\nthey accidentally alerted the guards in\nDivine Light Town. They wanted to\ncapture Saint Ruer and offer her to the\nLord. That's why a conflict with Yeha\noccurred. It's just that these heroic\nspirits were also fierce and unafraid of\ndeath, so they just surrounded and\nattacked. In the end, victory belonged\nto Yeihow's side. He and Rui seized\ncontrol of Divine Light Town,\nestablishing a firm foothold on the\nborder of Eagle Crest territory. Sibbin,\nof course, would not let this happen as\nit did in his past life. Yiha was\ndirectly causing trouble right before\nhis eyes. Although he couldn't do\nanything to the protagonist, the system\ndidn't say he couldn't touch the players\neither. It seemed many in this faction\nwere about to get their asses kicked by\nSibbon. So, he and Crimin went to the\nmansion of the mayor of Divine Light\nTown. At first, Sibbon was stopped by a\nman named Goodbye. He was the captain of\nthis town's guard, an intermediate\nswordsman, level 13 in Divine Light\nTown. He was also considered a talented\nperson, respected by the people. At\nfirst, goodbye was bearing his fangs.\nBut when he saw the golden lion emblem\non Sibbon's chest, he became cowardly.\nThis emblem could only be worn by people\nof the empire or lord. He hurriedly\nknelt. This esteemed lord, I'm the\ncaptain of the divine light town guar.\nGoodbye. May I ask what your orders are?\nSib silently assessed him. He was indeed\na little impressed as this was a\ntalented character in the game. He had\ntwo skills, sweeping cyclone and valiant\nassault. Moreover, these two skills\ncould be used in a combination with\nterrifying power. But according to the\nscript, in his past life, this captain\nwas ultimately defeated by the players.\nOnly then was the boss of the divine\nlight town map, Mayor Mean, revealed. To\nprevent that from happening, Sibbon had\nto be one step ahead of the plot. He\nasked goodbye to call mayor me out to\nsee him. Faced with that request, he\nseemed flustered. The mayor, he is busy.\nPerhaps you could wait a moment. I will\ncall him over. Sib didn't have time to\nwait. Yiha's appearance here proved that\nthe players were also about to be\nsummoned. So he walked directly into the\nmansion. What goodbye called busy was\nactually me being busy fooling around\nwith a scantily clad long-legged beauty\nin each arm. Seeing Sibbon kick the door\nopen and barge in. He didn't know his\nplace and yelled loudly, \"Who is it?\nDon't you want to live anymore? Can't\nyou see that this mayor is busy?\" But as\nsoon as he saw the other person's face\nwas so scared, his soul nearly left his\nbody. He h heardly pushed away the two\nscantily clad beauties in his arms and\nknelt before Sibbon. Esteemed young\nmaster Sibbon. Oh no, esteemed Lord,\nthis old servant prayed day and night to\nthe god of luck, and you have finally\ngraced us with your presence. Why didn't\nyou give a heads up so this old servant\ncould personally welcome you? Sibbin\nhimself was utterly disdainful of the\nold man's so-called busyness. If he had\ngiven notice, he wouldn't have seen this\nscene. However, Sibbon couldn't be\nbothered to care about that matter\nbecause what concerned him more now was\nMedin's mediocre ability. Not at all\nworthy of being the boss of this map.\nThe guy only had the strength of a level\n11 knight with two skills, mount and\ncharge and mounted spear assault.\nHowever, these two skills could only be\nused on horseback. Otherwise, Medin was\ntruly useless. Moreover, he was the type\nof person hated by both humans and\nsubhumans. Yet upon seeing Sibbin, Medin\nstill had the gall to boast that Divine\nLight Town had been very peaceful\nrecently. Sibbin scoffed. Medin's\nsickopantic attitude had already made\nhim very displeased. Now, the word\npeaceful coming from the guy's mouth was\neven more grading to his ears. Sib\npointed at the man's face, breathing\nfire. Peaceful, my ass. Subhumans have\nalready infiltrated your room, and you\ndon't know a damn thing. If that's the\ncase, don't sit in this mayor's seat\nanymore. I'll be the mayor. You be the\ncaptain of the guard here for me. When\nyou've understood things clearly, only\nthen will I reinstate you. A moment\nlater, goodbye saw Sibbon storming out\nof the mansion. Medin was crying behind\nhim, repeatedly saying he couldn't do\nit. But no matter how much he cried, he\ncouldn't make Sibbon change his mind.\nSibbin forced Mean to immediately stand\nguard here and properly perform the\nduties of the guard captain. Even the\nold man's horse was confiscated by\nSibbon. After hearing this, Goodbye's\nsoul flew to the clouds. Now, it wasn't\njust me hugging his leg and crying, but\ngoodbye joined in the fun as well. My\nlord, this really won't do. If he\nbecomes a guard captain, what will I do?\nAnnoyed by the two men hugging his left\nand right legs, Sibon yelled, you be my\npersonal guard, double the allowance.\nUpon hearing the words, double the\nallowance. Goodbye. Immediately stopped\ncrying, flashed a bright smile, and\nagreed. It's true that material\npossessions determine consciousness.\nAfter giving his orders, Sibbon rode out\non his horse, taking the injured\nsubhuman girl with him. Before leaving,\nhe didn't forget to order goodbye to\nprepare a clean room and a large\ncomfortable bed for him. Medan watched\nSibbons departing back, an unwilling\nexpression clear on his face. He even\nthought he was being pressured like this\nbecause he hadn't presented a gift in\ntime when Sibbon took office. \"So, this\nbrat likes subhumans, and he still\npretends to be noble and righteous with\nme,\" Mean thought to himself.\nAfterwards, he ordered his subordinates\nto find some beautiful subhuman slaves\nand bring them to the mayor's mansion\nwith the ambition of soon reclaiming the\nmayor's seat for himself. After taking\nthe subhuman girl to be treated, Sibbon\nbrought her back to the mayor's\nresidence. He carried the girl straight\ninto the room that Goodbye had prepared.\nThe child was still unconscious. Seeing\nthe two twitching squirrel ears and\ntail, Sib couldn't resist reaching out\nto stroke them. Just then, the child\nwoke up. Sib thought to himself, \"Oh no,\nthis time I'll be misunderstood for\nharassing her.\" But unexpectedly, the\nfirst thing the little girl said was,\n\"I'm sorry, my lord. I didn't mean to\ndirty your bed sheets. I don't know how\nI ended up here either. I'm sorry.\"\nSeeing the girl's pitiful, trembling\nappearance. Sib was about to speak to\ncomfort her. But right after, the child\nwas so scared she knelt and begged him\nnot to take her life. Sib was extremely\nflustered. Was his appearance really\nthat scary to frighten a child to this\nextent? I rescued you. Why would I take\nyour life? Try to remember carefully. At\nthat time, you were being bullied by a\ngroup of brats until you fainted. It was\nI who beat them to a pulp and brought\nyou here. At this, the little girl\ncalmed down a bit. Lorie remembers now,\nbut Lorie didn't faint from being hit. I\nfainted from hunger. As soon as she\nfinished speaking, her stomach rumbled\nloudly, making her blush with\nembarrassment. In this situation, Sibbon\ncouldn't be so inhumane as to continue\nstarving the girl named Lorie. So, he\nordered his subordinates to prepare a\ntable full of food. Lori was so hungry\nher vision blurred. She greedily stuffed\nbread in her mouth while constantly\nthanking him. Seeing the child eat with\nsuch an appetite, Sibbon also felt\nhappy. But right after, that damn system\nappeared again and brought a not so\nhappy notification. It turned out that\nthis overly humane act was not at all in\nline with the usual behavior of a\nvillain. The system demanded that Sibbon\nstop immediately or he would be\npunished. But after a few times, Sibbon\nhad realized that this system wasn't too\nrigid and its rules could be bent.\nTherefore, he retorted that he had saved\nthis subhuman child to raise her as his\npawn. At a critical moment, the girl\nwould become the one to backstab the\nplayers and the protagonist, Yeihow. The\nsystem was spun around by him like a top\nto the point of being speechless. After\nanalyzing Sibbon's behavior for a while,\nit determined that the plan he just\nmentioned was feasible. Therefore, it\nquickly updated his villainous behavior\nprotocol. In the future, Sibbon would no\nlonger be warned for similar situations.\nSibbon was extremely pleased, silently\ncursing that shabby system for being so\nstupid. Luckily, he had already\nunderstood its fatal weakness. As long\nas he rationalized the motive for his\nactions, he wouldn't be punished. After\nthat, the system began to update the\nDaily Villa missions. Today, like the\nday before, there were three missions.\nFirst, Sibon had to leave a\npsychological scar on 10 or more\nplayers. Next, he had to force Lorie to\ngive him a shoulder massage and warm his\nbed. Finally, Sibbon had to humiliate\nthe protagonist, Yeha, to receive a\nreward. Looking at these missions,\nSibbon was so shocked, he slammed the\ntable and stood up. Lorie was currently\nstuffing a chicken leg in her mouth. The\nlittle girl thought Sibbon was angry\nbecause she was eating too much, so she\ntimidly offered the chicken leg to him,\nthough she was still quite reluctant.\nEsteemed Lord, you eat. I'm not asking\nfor your food, kid. Also, don't call me\nesteemed lord anymore. I am the count of\neagle crest territory. My name is Sibbin\nof the Golden Lion clan. Speaking of\nwhich, Sibbon suddenly had a wicked\nidea. Gloria just said she wanted to\nrepay him. Then this was the most\nsuitable time as Sibbon happened to be\nin need of maid. So he invited the girl\nto take that position with the promise\nof three full meals a day and 2 days off\na week. Meanwhile, at the largest\nsubhuman slave farm in town, the farm\nowner was frantically beating the\npitiful subhuman girls. Just then, a few\nguards on horseback arrived saying that\nthe mayor wanted some beautiful slaves.\nSeeing this, the farm owner obsequiously\ntried to curry favor, saying that he had\njust captured a few slaves, all of them\nglistening and smooth, who would surely\nplease the mayor. With that said, he\nturned back, intending to whip the poor\ngirls again. But this time, before the\nwhip could even fall, it was stopped by\na strong arm. It turned out the players\nhad already appeared in Divine Light\nTown. A person named Lynn Fan led a few\nother players and bravely charged\nstraight into the slave trading camp.\nStop. Don't you know that human\ntrafficking is against the law?\nSubhumans are people. You brat, are you\nhere to cause trouble? The farm owner\nstruggled free and retorted. Lynn Fan\nwas momentarily speechless. He had\nforgotten that this world was fake and\nits legal system was nothing like the\nreal worlds, so he decided to handle it\ndifferently. Lynn Fan tossed a bag of\nmoney into the farm owner's hands, then\ndeclared he would buy all of these\nslaves. Inside were brand new gold\ncoins. Seeing this, the farm owner's\nexpression changed completely. Esteemed\nguest, these slaves have already been\nreserved by Lord Mayor Sibbon. If you\nwant subhuman slaves, please wait a\nmoment. Lynn Fan was half believing,\nhalf doubting because before coming\nhere, he had heard the dungeon boss was\nmeant. Why had a change of sib now?\nCould this be a game bug? However, while\nLynn Fan was still confused, the players\nfollowing him could no longer hold back.\nThey all drew their swords and\nthreatened the farm owner to release the\nsubhuman slaves immediately. The moment\nthe farm owner saw the blades, he was\nscared out of his wits and hastily fled.\nAnd right at this moment, Mean appeared.\nAlthough he had been stripped of his\nmayoral status by Sibbon, he was still\nthe boss of this dungeon. And even\nthough Sibbon looked down on this guy\nfor being as weak as a snail, to new\nlevel two and level three players like\nLynfan, the level 11 mag still posed a\nhuge threat. Not to mention the skills\nand equipment of the two sides were also\ntoo different. In that situation, they\ncould only hope for Yihow's help. And\nthis guy, true to his role as a\nrighteous protagonist, always appeared\njust in time. As soon as Yihow arrived,\nhe quickly activated the skill sacred\nshield for Fortress. With his support,\nthe other players immediately became\nmuch more confident, charging straight\ntowards me together. Everyone wanted to\ntake down the boss to get equipment.\nThus, the old man's health bar dropped\nrapidly, and in the end, he was defeated\nby a radiant. Cross slash from Yihow.\nThe group of players stared at each\nother blankly. Yihow is the main\ncharacter of the story, but in the end,\nhe was still just an NPC. What kind of\ngame design was this? Where an NPC ended\nup killstealing the boss from the\nplayers. Lynfan also found it hard to\nunderstand. They had fought so hard and\nthe boss only had a sliver of health\nleft. In the end, the main character\nrushed in to kill steel the last hit and\nhe even looked so magnificent doing it.\nAfter defeating me, Yihow looked very\nrelaxed. He then turned back to the\ngroup of players to announce something.\nIt was that they had helped a lot in\ntaking down this boss. Therefore, the\nweapons, armor, and all the wealth Mean\nhad accumulated belonged to them. Only\nthen did Lynn Fan's group stop\ngrumbling. It was fine to let the main\ncharacter shine. As long as they still\ngot rewards in the end, it was all good.\nSo, the whole group trooped over to the\nmansion of Medin. But as soon as they\narrived, they came across Sibanding\nimposingly waiting for them. The moment\nhe saw the players arrive, Sib put on a\ntough act, using his coldest voice to\nintimidate them. You harm my guards,\nkill my servant, and now you want to\nsteal my money to cause such a ruckus in\nmy territory. You're really quite\narrogant, aren't you? The players looked\nat each other blankly. They didn't know\nwho Sibbon was or why he was here.\nBecause at this early stage of the game,\nSibbon shouldn't be able to appear in\nthis place. Lynn Fan immediately used an\nappraisal skill to check the opponent.\nThe result was that apart from a name\nsib and golden lion level 44 and his\nidentity as the lord of eagle crest\nterritory they saw nothing else just a\nlevel 11 me required yehow's help for\nthem to defeat now a level 44 sib had\nshown up who could possibly beat him\nmore importantly why was the lord of\neagle crest territory here shouldn't you\nbe sitting comfortably in your lord's\ncastle the group of players began to\ncurse out the game developers making\nplayers in the newbie village face a\nfinal boss boss. Level two players\nfighting a level 44 boss. This was truly\nmaking a game with their knees. However,\neven though Sibbon was a nightmare level\nboss, these players still harbored the\nambition of taking him down. Because\njust think about it, how much good\nequipment and rewards would drop after\ndefeating him. Of course, they didn't\nhave the ability to do that. So, they\nturned to look at Eihow behind them with\nexpectant expressions. Yiha himself\ncouldn't do anything to Sibbon right now\neither. However, he was the one who had\nsummoned this group of players here with\nthe status of a mother hen. Of course,\nhe how had to be responsible for this\nflock of chicks. Therefore, he stepped\nforward to face Sibbon, venerable lord\nof Eagle Crest territory. I am Yeihow. I\nknow that you may not know me now, but I\ncan guarantee that in the future you\nwill definitely have a deep impression\nof this name, and you will also remember\nwhat a great mission I carry. It was\nunknown where Yeihow got the courage to\ndraw his sword and pointed at his\nopponent while speaking. Sibbin glanced\nat his profile, utterly contemptuous,\nbecause Yihow is only at level 11 right\nnow. If it weren't for the systems\nrestraints, he could have jumped\nstraight to the grand finale and sent\nhim to meet his maker. Since Yihow dared\nto show off his meager skills before an\nexpert like this, Sibbon didn't mind\ndrawing his own weapon. At that moment,\na magnificent blazing fire in the shape\nof a lion appeared behind him. I, the\nlord of eagle crest territory, Sibbon\nGolden Lion. Intruders, you will pay a\nheavy price for not knowing your own\nlimits. With that said, Sibbon slashed a\nline through the air decisively. That\nfiery lion charged furiously towards a\ncrowd. Yihow braced himself to defend,\nbut the power of a level 44 boss was an\neye openener for him. The protective\nshield was about to break. Yiha was\nstruggling immensely, but at least he\nwas still alive. But Lynn Fan's group\ncouldn't withstand this single blow from\nSibbon and were all killed. Sent back to\nthe respawn point. Sibbon's attack\ncreated a crater with a 10 m radius and\na depth of 1 meter. This area seemed\nenough to create a psychological scar on\nthe new players. They didn't wonder why\nthey had died. After all, their highest\nhealth bar was only 250. But a single\nnon-critical sword strike from Sibbon\nhad already dealt 3,126,782\ndamage. Getting wiped out was\nunderstandable. They only wondered why\nin a game with a proper story line, an\nNPC could still go on a killing spree\nlike this. The protagonist, Yihow, was\nalso panicking at this moment. He had\noriginally planned to just successfully\nsuppress Mayor Mean and take over Divine\nLight Town. He never expected the Lord\nof Eagle Crest territory to show up\nalong the way and with one sword strike\nwipe out all the heroic spirits he had\njust summoned. Lord of Eagle Crest\nterritory is it? Eihow's face was grimy,\nbut he still faced Sib resolutely.\nYou're the one who ordered your\nsubordinates to enslave subhumans and\ncapture people for your amusement,\nright? Hey, watch your mouth. Sibbin was\nclearly unhappy about being suddenly\naccused like this. When did I enslave\nsubhumans? When did I capture subhumans\nfor my amusement? But Yiha was in no\nmood to listen to those words. He was\nseen bracing himself and then yelling\nout, prepared to receive the judgment of\njustice. The sword in Yihow's hand\nemitted a blue light. Sibbin didn't know\nwhat method he had used, but Yihow's\nlevel had temporarily skyrocketed, too.\nLevel 45, becoming an Earth Knight, one\nlevel stronger than Sibbin. At the same\ntime, he also unlocked five new skills\nand two new pieces of equipment. Sibbin\nalso raised his sword to defend,\nsilently praising his opponent for being\nquite impressive to have his level\nincrease like that. Yeiha was indeed\nworthy of being the protagonist chosen\nby fate. After this power burst, he was\neven a level higher than him. If it were\nthe kidney deficient Lord Sibbin from\nhis previous life, he would probably be\nkneeling and begging for mercy by now.\nThat Sibin of the Golden Lion clan, I\nwill show you what true power is. You\nare still far from it. Yihao charged\nforward, carrying a blazing rage and a\nterrifying power. On the other side,\nSibbon was also ready to counter that\npower. But the moment he was about to\ncounterattack, the system issued a new\nwarning. It had detected that Sibbon was\nabout to perform a dangerous action and\nthat he must immediately abandon the act\nof attacking the child of fate. So, even\nthough their strengths were comparable,\nSibbon was still helpless to let his\nopponent knock him flying dozens of\nmeters away. The pain was one thing, but\nthe humiliation was 10 times worse for\nSibbon because at this moment, the group\nof players had once again gathered\naround to gossip. They were all praising\nYeihow for being super strong. Yihow\nlooks so handsome holding a sword, while\nSibbon is just trash. Sibbon didn't know\nwhat to say either. These players truly\nhad no filter. They dare to say\nanything. If they knew this wasn't just\na simple game world, but a real world,\nhe wondered if they would still be able\nto laugh. Then on the other side, Yihow\ncharged forward once again, but Sibbon\nwas no longer just standing there and\ntaking it. The system wouldn't let him\nattack Yihow. In that case, letting\nGrimman handle it would be fine. Yihow\nwas intercepted and began to panic. Grim\nwas four levels stronger than him, and\nthe players who were just cheering for\nhim a moment ago were now all silent. Is\nthis the Knights Code you worship? What\na disgrace. Yehow gritted his teeth and\ncursed at Sibbon. Because in a duel\nbetween two knights, a third person had\nsuddenly appeared. But wasn't Sibbon a\nvillainous boss? He could still endure a\nfew curses. Besides, Sibbin was first a\nlord, then a count, and only lastly a\nknight. Who in this world has ever heard\nof a lord or a count having to fight\nalone? Moreover, Yhow wasn't even worthy\nof being his opponent. And so, the old\nguard Grimman, despite his age, still\nhad to personally enter the fry because\nof his young master's troublemaking.\nYiha was utterly bewildered by the\nattack of Grim. Both his speed and power\nwere far superior. In the end, he was\nsent flying by a punch from his\nopponent. Sibbon then leisurely walked\nover and stepped right on Yiha's chest\nwith a triumphant smile. \"You can't kill\nme,\" Yi House said stubbornly. \"You\nsaid, \"I was going to kill you.\" Sib\nstill wore a mocking smile. Then he\ngrabbed Yiha by the collar, pulled his\nopponent up, and slapped him. The group\nof players were instantly petrified. It\nhad to be said Yiha was the one who\nsummoned them. The very belief they\nfollowed. Yet now he was being\nhumiliated by Sibbin to this extent.\nYou're Eihow, right? You want me to\nremember your name, don't you? You want\nto show me what real power is, huh? With\nevery sentence, Sibbon slapped Yeihow\nwith all his might until Yeihow was\nexhausted and flattened on the ground.\nUnable to get back up, he then used his\nhand. A victor smile appeared on\nSibbon's face. He dusted off his hands\nand said, \"This lord is in a good mood\ntoday, so I'll spare your worthless\nlife. You want revenge, don't you? I'll\nbe waiting.\" After speaking, he and\nGrimman casually departed. The\nsurrounding players could only\nautomatically part to the sides,\nclearing a path for them. Yihow, at this\nmoment, had been beaten until his face\nwas swollen and he no longer looked\nhuman. Sib strode alongside Grim,\nincessantly mocking Yihow's strength,\nwhich turned out to be just this much.\nHe had originally thought the child of\ndestiny would be some kind of invincible\nbeing. He never expected him to be just\na grassroots upstart. Having inflicted\npsychological trauma on Lynn fans group\nand beaten Yihao so badly he couldn't\nget up. His missions were considered\ncomplete. The crowd of players stared\nafter Sib's departing figure for a long\ntime before looking at each other in a\ndays. The Lord didn't take those\nsubhuman slaves with him. It seems he's\nnot as bad as the rumors say. After\npreventing Yihow and his companions from\ntaking over Divine Light Town, Sibbon\ncould finally return with peace of mind.\nThis time, accompanying him and Grim was\nalso the little subhuman girl, Lorie. It\nwas her first time riding in a griffin\ndrawn carriage, so she was a bit\nbewildered. Sibbon thought Lorie was\nreluctant to leave her hometown, but her\nanswer made him ponder for a few\nseconds. It's not that I'm reluctant,\nLord. It's just that since my brother\npassed away, this is the first time\nLorie has traveled so far alone, so I'm\na little nervous. Sibbon sighed\ninwardly. What a pitiful child, orphaned\nat such a young age, having lost both\nher parents and her brother. He then\npatted Lor's head to comfort her, saying\nthat although he couldn't change the\nconflict and strife between subhumans\nand humans right now, as long as he was\nhere, no one in the entire Eagle Crest\nterritory would dare to bully her. In\nthat moment, Lorie's small heart skipped\na beat. It was the first time she\nrealized that the Lord was actually a\ngentle person. They were riding in a\nflying lion beast carriage, so they\nquickly returned to the Lord's palace.\nLorie excitedly looked all around. She\nhad previously thought Mayor Mag's\nmansion was already magnificent. Only\nafter arriving here did she realize the\nLord's palace was far more so. She\ncouldn't believe she would be living in\nsuch a luxurious place. Lord, does Lori\nreally just need to be your handmaiden?\nThat's right. Your job will roughly be\nto take care of my daily life. Seeing\nLorie's tense expression, Sibbon had to\ncomfort her again. Don't worry so much.\nI'm not like other nobles. I don't have\nmany rigid rules. As for the specific\nduties of a handmaiden, Sibbon planned\nto have Chris teach Lorie in a few days.\nShe was an experienced palace\nhandmaiden, and more importantly, she\nwas very enthusiastic. Speak of the\ndevil, and the devil appears. Chris\nrushed over from out of nowhere. Then,\nignoring all etiquette, pulled Sibbon\ninto a tight hug against her chest,\nnearly suffocating him. \"Chris, weren't\nyou supposed to arrive in a few days?\"\nSib yelled while trying to struggle out\nof that B-cup chest. \"I heard the little\nyoung master had become the new lord. I\nthought you would definitely need me. I\nwas afraid you'd ask for milk like when\nyou were little. So, I spurred my horse\non and rushed here without stopping.\"\nThis Chris was not only a handmaiden in\nthe past, but also served as Sibbon's\nwet nurse. Hearing her mention his\nchildhood nursing, he didn't know where\nto hide his face from embarrassment.\nChris was truly as enthusiastic as\nbefore. To ease the awkward atmosphere\nand stop Chris from mentioning his\nchildhood nursing, Sib changed the\nsubject and introduced Laura to her.\nFrom today on, she will be my personal\nhandmaiden. Please take her to get\nfamiliar with the environment and the\nduties of a handmaiden. Chris looked at\nthe tiny subhuman girl, asking with some\nconcern, a personal handmaiden,\nseemingly noticing the doubt in her\neyes, Sibbon quietly told Chris about\nthe circumstances under which he met the\ngirl, that he had accidentally saved her\nin Divine Light Town when she was almost\nbeaten to death. Therefore, Sibon also\nhoped Chris wouldn't be too harsh with\nLorie. His intentions were very simple,\nbut when Chris heard it, it was no\nlonger so simple. she said meaningfully,\n\"It seems the little young master from\nback then has truly grown up. This is\nindeed a beautiful little subhuman girl.\nI will definitely teach her properly.\"\nFor some reason, Sibbon felt that there\nwas something wrong with that sentence,\nbut he let it go. It was good enough\nthat Chris was willing to teach Lorie.\nWhile Sibbon had returned to his palace\nand settled in back in Divine Light\nTown, Yiha still couldn't swallow his\nrecent anger, especially since all the\nplayers were gossiping about how he was\nbeaten by Sibbon until his face was\nswollen. Before the players had greatly\nrevered Yeihow, considering him the best\nand the strongest. But after seeing him\nbeaten to the point where he couldn't\neven get up, they began to think that\nthe protagonist of the can continent\nmust be the lord of Eagle Crest\nterritory, Sibbin of the Golden Lion\nClan. Yeha was so angry he slammed his\nfists on the table. Damn it. In my past\nlife, I was a genius from an ancient\nmartial arts family. And in this life,\nI'm a world-saving hero who overthrows a\ntyrannical lord. I am the real\nprotagonist. The more Yhow thought about\nit, the more resentful he became. He was\nborn with the skill to foresee his own\nfuture. The events that followed were\nexactly as yeh how had seen in his\npremonitions. Therefore, he was very\nconfident that he could overthrow the\ntyranny and become the hero of the\nsubhuman race in this territory. But\njust when everything was going smoothly,\nSibbin's sudden appearance threw it all\noff course. Not only that, he also\nturned Yiha into a laughingstock in the\neyes of the players. Yeiha is so angry\nhe started to cry, gritting his teeth as\nhe growled Sibbon's name. Lord of Eagle\nCrest territory, I Yiha will one day\ntear you into a hundred pieces. Sibbon\nwas having a meal in his palace in Twin\nEast Town at that moment. Suddenly, he\nfelt a vicious bone chilling cold\nenvelop his entire body. After the\nshiver passed, Sibbon was able to pick\nup his plate and continue eating. Just\nthen, a night entered. Previously, Sibon\nhad ordered his subordinates to find him\nsome priests with some skill. But upon\nreturning, they brought bad news. All\nthe priests at the church had refused to\ncome and perform healing arts.\nFurthermore, their bishop had the\naudacity to say that Lord Sibbon Golden\nLion was a mad man for wanting the\nshepherds of the gods to heal a subhuman\nwho was even lowlier than a commoner.\nSibbin's hand, which was cutting his\nfood, stopped. This clearly displeased\nhim greatly. He had only just taken\noffice and his subjects were already\ndisobeying his orders. It seemed they\ndidn't take a lord like Sibbons\nseriously at all. For a mere priest to\ndare to look down on him like this,\nSibbons certainly couldn't let this\ncontinue. He ordered the knight to find\nGrimman for him to have him lead a\ncavalry unit to surround the church, and\nhe himself would also personally go.\nSibbin's anger was flaring up, but it\nwas immediately extinguished when Lorie\nappeared. The little girl had now\nchanged into a maid's outfit. Her\ncuteness multiplied tfold. She was so\ncute it should be illegal. Seeing the\nLord's dazed look, Lorie seemed very\nworried. Lord, do I look very strange?\nIt was Sister Chris who told me to wear\nthis. Not at all. Not at all. It suits\nyou very well. Sibbon hurriedly patted\nher head to comfort her. Afterwards, he\nhanded Lorie over to Chris's care as he\nhad to go out to handle important\nbusiness. Chris promised that when he\nreturned tonight, she would present him\nwith a well- behaved and sensible\nhandmaiden. Only then did Sibbon leave\nthe main hall with peace of mind. Before\nleaving, he didn't forget to give Lorie\na valuable looking potion and told her\nto remember to drink it later. Lorie\nlooked at the sparkling red potion in\nher hand, not yet realizing what it was.\nWhen Chris leaned in and whispered in\nher ear, \"Little Lorie, it seems young\nMaster Sibbon likes you very much.\"\nLorie didn't understand what like meant\nin this context. But Chris's words were\nenough to make her start an alarm. How\ncould that be? Sister Chris, please\ndon't tease Lori, she replied shily.\nAya, I'm not tricking you. The reason\nChris said this was because the item in\nLor's hand was a vial of water of life.\nIt was taken from the spring of life in\nthe Elven Royal Court, an extremely rare\nitem that one couldn't necessarily buy\neven with money. Most importantly, it\nwas the only thing with healing effects\non the continent, and its true function\nwas to extend one's lifespan and\neliminate internal injuries. The more\nLorie listened to Chris, the more\nastonished she became, unconsciously\ntightening her grip on a vial in her\nhand. \"I uh my 13th husband initially\nused this to propose to me, which is why\nI agreed,\" Chris recounted\nenthusiastically. But this astonished\nLorie even more than the potion. \"A\nsister who looks so young has already\nhad 13 husbands.\" While the two girls\nwere back at the palace, Sibbon had\nalready led his troops to surround the\nchurch. The bishop here was a fanatic\nwho served the god of war. As soon as he\nsaw Sibbon appear, his face darkened\nwith anger. Lord, do you intend to\nmurder a shepherd of the gods right\nunder his eyes? This man was named\nMartin, a level 38 arch. He was\nproficient in highlevel fire magic,\npossessed the skills sacrifice, summon\ndivine attendant, and the most important\nskill Sibbon needed now, holy healing.\nHe was the only bishop in this eagle\ncrest territory. So he was quite famous,\nbut his hands were stained with the\nblood of subhumans, making him extremely\nhated by their race. So this was the\nreason Martin refused the Lord's\ninvitation for healing. Sibbon had seen\nthrough this old man's facade.\nOutwardly, he always preached morality,\nbut he was just a wararmonger who had\nalso killed countless innocent\nsubhumans. The more Sibbin looked at\nMartin, the more of an eyesore he found\nhim, so he spoke provocatively. No\nmatter how you look at it, the light of\nthe gods will never shine upon you,\nBishop Martin. As soon as Sibbin\nfinished speaking, a surge of power shot\npast him. Although it didn't injure him,\nthe golden lion crest on his chest\ncracked and fell to the ground. This was\na clear insult to Sibbon's status and\nhis clan. Sibbon didn't think Martin was\ncapable of that, and he quickly\ndiscovered the real culprit. It was a\nhidden man cowering behind Martin. His\nname was Cutter, a holy temple knight\nwith the strength of an earth knight on\npar with Sibbon. both at level 44. Holy\ntemple knights like this guy are the\nsecret power of the church. Although\ntheir numbers are few and their\nmovements are mysterious, their power is\nindeed immense. Something Sibbon had\nheard of before. It seems that the\nstrength of an earth knight like this\ncutter is the lowest among the Holy\nTemple Knights. No wonder the priests in\nthe church dared to openly defy the\nLord's orders. It turns out it was\nbecause they had a Holy Temple Knight\nbacking them. If these people aren't\ndealt with soon, I'm afraid they'll be\nwalking all over me. Sibbon understood\nthis clearly, so he quickly drew his\nsword. Bishop Martin, as a priest, you\nopenly defy the Lord's command and even\ninsult me, the Lord of Eagle Crest,\ncalling me a madman. According to the\nlaws of the colony or empire, I have the\nright to execute you right now. Do you\nhave any last words? Sibbon's tone was\nextremely serious. But not only was\nMartin unafraid, he even scoffed at him\nbecause he felt that the Lord of Eagle\nCrest asking the most loyal servant of\nthe god Bond to treat a lowly subhuman\nwas the greatest insult in the world.\nEven if his majesty the king were\npresent, he might not agree. Sibbon knew\nthis stubborn man wouldn't be frightened\nby his threats, but he had no intention\nof making empty threats either. If\nthat's what you say, then your church no\nlonger needs to exist. Sibbon's blade\nwas now blazing with the golden lion\nflame and he was ready for a good fight.\nSibbon assigned Grimman to deal with the\nHoly Temple Knight Cutter while he would\nhandle Bishop Martin. All the remaining\ncavalry men also received their orders.\nThey were tasked with wiping out the\nentire church today, leaving no one\nalive. The moment Sibbon attacked\nMartin, Cutter also rushed forward. But\nthis poorly hidden foe had long been in\nGrim's sights. His opponent is me. While\nMartin was struck by the Lord's sword,\nalthough he was level 38, he couldn't\nwithstand a single blow from him, Sibbon\nopenly scorned his opponent for turning\nout to be just a straw bag. Martin was\nknocked backward, severely injured. Sib\nfelt that with his next move, he could\nsend him to the afterlife without even\nusing a skill. Although Martin was in a\nweaker position, his mouth was still\nrunning at full capacity, ceaselessly\ncursing Sibbon. Lord of Eagle Crest, you\ndare to bully the loyal servant of my\nGod like this. Our god will not forgive\nyou. You're always talking about your\ngod. Why don't you call your god to save\nyou now? Sib said annoyed. As for\nMartin, even with sibb's sword at his\nthroat, he remained defiant. In the end,\nhe himself grabbed the blade, plunged it\nstraight into his own chest, and\nmuttered ceaselessly before taking his\nlast breath. My merciful God, your\nhumble servant, Martin willingly\nforsakes his weak soul to become a\nstepping stone for your supreme power.\nThe words Martin spoke seemed to be not\njust empty talk, but a curse. Even\nsomeone in control like Sibbon could\nfeel a significant pressure. As soon as\nMartin finished speaking, his body\ninstantly vanished, transforming into a\nblazing red flame. Sibbin was trapped by\nthe flame, feeling an inescapable sense\nof oppression. He realized that it was\nthe flame of the god Bond, the god of\nwar and the flame dragon who had\ndescended. This event was completely\nbeyond Sib's expectations. He didn't\nthink that a minor priest like Martin\ncould summon a real god. The situation\nwas not good as his body was now almost\ncompletely immobilized. The flames still\nsurrounded Sibbon, making it extremely\ndifficult for him to breathe, and he\nfinally coughed up a mouthful of fresh\nblood. Sibbon hurriedly called for Grim,\nbut he was currently busy fighting\nCutter. And strangely, a level 49 great\nEarth knight like him seemed to be\ngetting overwhelmed by an opponent who\nwas only level 44. Cutter even sneered\nat Grimman, calling him someone who\ndidn't know his own limits. After a\nbeautiful slash, Grim was sent flying by\nhis opponent. Sib hadn't even saved\nhimself yet, so he couldn't go help him.\nHe just felt that this was absurd. With\nGrimman's strength, how could he be at a\ndisadvantage against that holy temple\nknight? As for Sibbon, he was still\nbeing engulfed by the flame dragon's\nfire. With each passing minute, his life\nbecame more fragile. Blood poured from\nhis mouth and nose, and Sibbon's mind\nwent blank. Is there really no way to\nescape this deadly fate in this cursed\nchurch? Sibbin could no longer stand\nsteady. He had to use his sword to prop\nhimself up just to barely sit upright.\nBut at the moment of his body's greatest\npain, Sibbon suddenly felt a refreshing\nenergy pouring into his body. Not only\ndid his will feel at ease, but the\nburning sensation also disappeared. Even\nhis wounds were slowly closing. At this\nmoment, a smile appeared on Sib's lips.\nTriumphant, we'll see who is truly\nprotected by God. He glanced over at\nGrimman, who was still struggling with\nthat hidden holy temple knight. Grimman\nattacked with all his might, but not\nonce could he bring his sword down with\nfull force. Cutter didn't have to endure\nhis attacks. So, of course, his body\nwasn't harmed, and he looked very smug\nbecause he was getting the upper hand\nagainst a renowned great Earth knight of\nthe Empire. Can't hit me, can you? Then\njust give up and die. Cutter's laughter\nechoed far and wide. As soon as he\nfinished laughing and speaking, he\nunleashed a sword strike filled with\noverwhelming killing intent. If Grimman\nwere hit by this move, he might not have\nsurvived, but fortune smiled upon him.\nThis move fromQar was neutralized by\nSibbon. He didn't even need to look to\nrecognize the owner of that dazzling\ngolden sword light, so he began to sigh\nand grumble. Looks like that useless\nMartin is dead. That guy is more of a\nhindrance than a help. It's a shame the\nPope entrusted such an important matter\nto him. Sibbon saved Grimman in the nick\nof time, feeling a great sense of\nrelief. He seemed to be blaming himself\nfor not being able to defeat Cutter. But\nSibbon didn't blame Grimman for it\nbecause he realized that this holy\ntemple knight was one of the modified\nones whose strength couldn't be measured\nby normal standards. It basically didn't\nknow the meaning of pain, merely a\npitiful life-taking weapon created by\nthe church, not even considered a person\nanymore. Having his secret exposed by\nSibin, Cutter wasn't flustered, but\nactually found it interesting. He\nchuckled. Interesting. Very interesting,\nkid. You sure know a lot about the\nchurch's important secrets. At this\nmoment, the two eyes always hidden\nunderQ's cloak were revealed. A pair of\nblood red eyes. Unfortunately, the more\nyou know, the sooner you die. As soon as\nhe finished speaking, Cutter's body\nbegan to transform. And that\ntransformation made both Sibbon and Grim\ngasp in astonishment. He was clearly in\nhuman form. In the blink of an eye, he\nhad turned into a giant wolf. Cutter was\nindeed not a normal human. He was a\nwerewolf. It seems the Bond church's\nmodification of the Holy Temple Knights\nis even more perverse than Sibbon had\nimagined. But based on his appraisal\nskill, Sibbon could feel somewhat\nrelieved because this insane enhancement\nof cutters was only temporary. He\nquickly shared this secret with Grim.\nGrim, his enhancement is only temporary.\nIf we can hold him off, we can win. As\nhe spoke, Sibbon gripped his sword\ntightly, ready to go all out against\nthat halfman halfwolf bastard. Cutter\nunleashed a fatal blow, trying to force\nSibbon into a deadly spot, but he\nquickly dodged the attack and used his\ninternal energy to leap off the ground.\nIn midair, Sibbon quickly cast a spell\nthat made his whole body emit a golden\nlight. Sibbin bravely charged forward,\nbringing his sword straight down on the\nwerewolf, forcing him to kneel on one\nleg to defend. His face was full of\nconfidence because this was a very\npowerful move called Dragon Star Aegis.\nBefore he was even done dealing with\nSibbon, Cutter quickly noticed Grimman\ncharging from behind for a sneak attack.\nIn front, Sibbin's sword blocked his\nmovement. Behind, Grimman was charging.\nHe was caught in a dilemma, causing him\nto exclaim, \"Damn insects!\" And he\nthought he couldn't wait any longer, as\nthe longer he used the enhancement, the\nmore life force it consumed. Cutter\nbecame furious, unleashing his full\npower, his eyes turning a terrifying\nblood red. Cutter swung his arm,\nthrowing Sibbon far away and said\nthrough gritted teeth, \"Go to hell.\"\nGrim was painfully kicked dozens of\nmeters away by him. He was kicked into a\nwall, the impact so strong that the wall\ncracked and rubble fell everywhere.\nCutter stood up straight, held his hands\nout in front, and looked back at Sib\nwith disdain for the previous setback.\nAs a werewolf, he had a large body. He\ngrabbed Sib by the neck and lifted him\ninto the air, causing him to struggle\nwith no choice but to grab his hairy\narm. Cutter growled. I originally wanted\nto hand you over to his holiness the\npope. He changed his mind, his hand\ntightening around his neck. Cutter\nopened his mouth, his fangs sharp, as he\nwanted to devour Sibbon. Before he knew\nwhat was happening, Cutter took a punch\nto the face from Sibbon, who confidently\nasked if he could really eat him. Only\nthen did Cutter realized his enhancement\npower had disappeared. He was stomped to\nthe ground by Sibbon's foot. The ground.\nHe smiled, his face looking terrifying\nat that moment. What I used wasn't\nDragon Star Aegis, but a time flow\nbarrier. You broke the barrier yourself,\nso you can't blame me. Cutter seemed to\ngo mad, forcing himself to stand up and\nshouting that his previous action was\ndespicable. Sib paid him no mind,\nquickly taking the sword in his hand and\ndecisively severing Cutter's head. He\nclenched his fists and said decisively,\n\"For devout followers of your god like\nyou, only beheading you can make you\nhonest.\" After speaking, Cibbon lowered\nhis sword, rested his head on it, and\nlet out a satisfied sigh, relieved that\nit was finally over. But then he\npanicked, his eyes widening as he\nrealized Grimman was still buried in the\nrubble. Some soldiers pulled the\nbutler's arms out of the debris. Sib\nstood beside them, waving his hands. Who\nwas it again? Huh? Goodbye. Go get a\npriest to cast a healing spell on\nGrimman. But Goodbye scratched his head\nand replied, \"Young master, there are no\nmore priests in Twinn's Town.\" He\npointed behind him at some headless\ncorpses and said, \"You said not to leave\nanyone alive, so we killed all the\npriests.\" Hearing this, Sibbon was\nspeechless and could only utter, \"You're\nreally something else.\" Sibbin covered\nhis face with his hands in helplessness.\n\"All right, then go to my study and get\na vial of water of life for Grimman.\" He\npointed and ordered the remaining\nsoldiers, \"The rest of you, on my\ncommand, search the ruins of the church.\nBring back anything of value to me.\" The\ntwo soldiers obeyed his command in\nunison, answering, \"Yes, sir.\" Sibbon\nstood by the ruins to manage the work\nwhile the soldiers struggled to dig\nthrough. The rubble to bring out what\nwas considered valuable as per his\norders. Suddenly, a thought echoed in\nhis mind. \"Twin East Town is still short\non people, huh?\" Sib frowned, thinking,\n\"In the future, I'll definitely have to\ngo to other territories and snatch a few\npriests. They're usually not needed for\nanything, but when they are, they can\njust do their thing for me. Before he\ncould finish that thought, a soldier\nrushed over. My lord, we've discovered a\nbasement. Instead of being surprised,\nSibbon appeared as calm as if it were\nnothing significant. A basement? What's\nso surprising about that? Is it\nunreasonable for a church to have a\nbasement? The soldier, fearful and\nhesitant, tried to dissuade him this.\nThe situation down there is complicated.\nMy lord, I think you should go see for\nyourself. Beneath the church floor,\nthere was indeed a basement. The\nsoldier, holding an oil lamp, led Sibbon\ndown my lord, this way. The two of them\ncuriously pushed open a door that had\nlong been sealed. A scent wafted out,\nforcing him to cover his nose. Sibbon\nwas horrified, his eyes wide with\ndisbelief at what he was seeing. Before\nhim were rows of female corpses, already\nstarting to smell, their clothes torn\nand tattered, some without a single\nscrap of cloth to cover them. The oil\nlamp fell to the ground and broke in\ntoo. Haunted by the corpses and unable\nto bear the overwhelming stench of\ndeath, the soldier immediately started\nto vomit. Sibbon's eyes noticed an\nenvelope on a table. The letter was on\nthe blood spattered table. Picking up\nthe letter, he read its contents.\nEsteemed Pope, praise be to Ba, Martin\ngreets you. The blood for this holy\nblood ritual has been prepared. It will\nbe sent to the royal capital before\nJune. There are still quite a few blood\nbags in Eagle Crest territory, but they\nare hidden very deep and it's impossible\nto capture them in a short time. I\nimplore your assistance. Also, if\npossible, I request that you reassign\nCutter because he is not an easy person\nto work with. He is conservative,\nstubborn, borish, and foolish with a\npersonality as foul as a latrine stone.\nAfter reading, Sibbon was furious. One\nhand clenched into a fist, the other\nholding the letter. He slammed it hard\non the table, grinding his teeth. These\npeople from the Holy Church are truly\ninsane. He thought to himself, judging\nby this letter, the origin of the Holy\nTemple Knights seems to be this\nmysterious holy blood ritual. At the\nsame time, the blood of young subhumans\nis an essential medium for the ritual.\nIt feels like a pair of hands are\nmanipulating everything from behind the\nscenes. Why did the previous lord so\nblatantly round up young subhuman girls?\nWas it really just for his perverted\nhobbies? Was promulgating the subhuman\nslavery convention his idea alone? Or\nwas there another hand pushing from\nbehind? Did the Cologne Empire attack\nthe subhuman duche really just because\nof the sudden outbreak of a holy war?\nBut the more he thought, the more\nconfusing it became. Sibbon shook his\nhead. Forget it. I won't think about it\nanymore. Let it be. I haven't even\nfigured out the players issues and my\nown. I don't have the energy to care\nabout the Cologne Empire and the\nSubhuman Duchy. In Twin East Town, the\nflame in the lamp burned brightly.\nSibbon sat alone in the lamplight,\nengrossed in looking at the few gold\ncoins on the table. He picked up a gold\ncoin and showed contempt. Martin, you\nwere a whole bishop, yet you only had\ntwo or three gold coins on you. Is that\nproper? Isn't this an embarrassment to\nthe Church of Bond? Soon after,\ndrowsiness washed over him, making him\ntired. He yawned long and wide. I don't\ncare anymore. I'll get some sleep and\ndeal with it later. Just as he was about\nto get into bed after a long day full of\nevents, he discovered someone was lying\nin his bed. Sibbon, annoyed,\naggressively pulled the blanket off the\nbed and shouted, \"Get out here.\"\nUnexpectedly, the person under the\nblanket was Lowly, who was still\nsleeping soundly, which surprised him.\n\"Loly, why are you here?\" The little\ngirl was sleeping so soundly she was\ndrooling on the bed. She turned her head\nand saw it was Sibbon. \"My lord, you're\nback.\" Loly looked truly adorable. She\nsat up, rubbed her eyes, and explained\nthat the reason she was in bed was\nbecause she came to help Sibbon warm it.\nOn the bed with its warm mattress, Loly\ncurled up on her knees, looking both\ninnocent and also seductive. Sibbon was\nas happy as a blooming flower, wondering\nwhat on earth Chris had taught Lowly.\nSibbon sat down on the bed. Although he\nwas delighted, he still forced himself\nto say, \"Then give me a shoulder rub.\nI'm really tired today.\" Lowly\nobediently and gently replied, \"Yes,\nmaster.\" While sinking into the\ncomfortable feeling, Sibbon discovered\nsomething on Loly. He curiously pulled\nit out. \"What is this?\" It caused a\nbunch of small things to fall all over\nthe floor, and the little girl couldn't\nhelp but panic. \"Master, don't.\" Loly\nhurriedly explained that she had picked\nall these things up. Sibbon sighed in\nadmiration. Loly is truly a little\nsquirrel, always hiding things, but her\nexpression looks like she's afraid. I'll\ntake her treasures away. Huh? While\npondering, his eyes lit up as if he had\njust remembered something. Ah, that's\nright. Isn't there still that thing? The\nlittle girl lowly didn't understand what\nher master was talking about. Sib stood\nup, turned around, and helped Lowy up.\nWhatever you have, just put it here.\nDon't hide it in your tail anymore.\nLowly happily and readily hugged him.\nThank you, master. The beautiful little\ngirl, with a seductive look in her eyes,\nexpressed her desire to serve her.\nmaster for the night since it was late.\nSibbon was flustered when he heard her\nsay that, thinking again that Chris had\ncorrupted Loly by teaching her these\nthings. He tried to use his reason to\nask Loly how old she was this year.\nMaster, by human calculation, Lowi is 18\nyears old. By subhuman calculation, I'm\n16. Sibbon was as happy as a child\nreceiving a gift, his eyes shining\nbrightly when he heard lowly say that\nsubhumans come of age at 14. he muttered\nto himself, thinking that coming of age\nmeant it was legal. Suddenly, a ding\nsound rang out. It was the systems\nnotification sound detected a spike in\nthe host's male hormones and heart rate.\nJudging that the host is about to engage\nin reproductive behavior based on the\nfemale creatures the host has been in\nrecent contact with, the reproductive\npartner is determined to be the\nhandmaiden. Lowly, warning. Lowy's\nconstitution is extremely weak. If\nreproductive behavior is forced, it will\ncause irreparable damage. For the\nspecific reason, the host is advised to\ncheck. The host is advised to improve\nLowley's physique before. Continuing\nwith reproductive behavior. Hearing\nthis, he was completely disappointed and\nlet his arms fall from Ly's body. Sibbon\nthrew himself onto the bed, causing Loly\nto worry. The bed warming isn't done\nyet. The little girl still tried to\nexplain. Miss Chris said, \"I have to hug\nyou and and I have to.\" Faced with such\ntempting words, he couldn't be more\ndesperate. All guilt, morality,\nconscience, and reason stopped Sibbon\nfrom any further action. And now all he\ncould do was cover his face with his\nhands and cry. You must have\nmisunderstood. Warming the bed like this\nis fine. After a long night, light shone\nthrough the window, brightening the\nroom. After a sleepless night, his eyes\nhad dark circles. Siban tiredly\ncomplained to the system that he wanted\nto claim his reward. The system\ndisplayed a notification. Host has\ncompleted all daily tasks. Announcing\nthe reward. This made him sit up\nstraight, eagerly awaiting the reward\nand curious about what it would be.\nCongratulations to the host for\nreceiving a minotaur warrior. The reward\nwill be delivered in a reasonable\nmanner. The host is advised to prepare\nan open space. This reward did not\ntrigger a critical hit. Please continue\nto work hard. But hearing this, he could\nonly sigh. No critical hit. Then he\nsuddenly became unusually excited and\nhappy. Although there's no critical hit,\nthis is a minotaur, an elite unit of the\nBeastman Empire. A natural heavy\ninfantryman with a status equivalent to\nthe crusaders of the Cologne Empire.\nTheir overall strength is around that of\na great knight. While wondering what\ndelivered in a reasonable manner meant,\nthe system emitted a blue light which\nmade Sibbon curious. A warrior appeared\nbefore him. The light dazzled him, and\nin his mind he had already guessed what\nit was. Before his eyes was the minotaur\nwarrior the system had just mentioned.\nHe was tall and large with a fierce gaze\nholding a large axe in his hand. All of\nthis was mostly within Sib's\nexpectations. That minotaur's name was\nCarg, a minotaur warrior of the blood\nhoof clan with skills including primal\ncharge, war stomp, and sundering cleave.\nHe spoke expressing his loyalty. The\nBlood Hoof Clan will serve you, my lord.\nThese minotaurs came from another world,\nnot the native minotaurs of the Kana\ncontinent. A knock sounded at the door.\nIt was lowly carrying a pastry and a\nglass of water for Sibbon's breakfast.\nBefore Sibbon could understand, he\nquickly shouted, \"Loly, wait a moment.\nDon't open the door.\" Just as she\nstepped in, Ly's eyes were met with a\nmassive body of the minur. \"Hello,\nstrange little human.\" He scared the\nlittle girl so much she was frightened\nout of her wits. Car yelled at Ben that\nhe was an idiot for scaring her away.\nCar consoled and sincerely apologized to\nSibbon, who had his face in his hands.\nMy lord, I've caused you trouble. Ben is\nactually a very gentle person. He meant\nno harm. Sib thought it was just\nexcessive shock. The people in the\ncastle don't know you guys, so it's\nunavoidable they'd be scared seeing you\nfor the first time. They'll get used to\nit later. Lol was still passed out from\nbeing so terrified by the people she had\nseen. Sibin sent someone to lead you\nguys to familiarize yourselves with the\nterritory first. Get to know the people\nin the castle and then I will arrange\nwork for you. The group of minotaurs\ncheered, shouting and showing their\ndetermination when they heard Sibbon\nsay, \"Don't worry. My territory is on\nthe Empire's border. There will be wars\nto fight in the future. You won't be\nstuck guarding the castle every day.\" He\ngot angry at the noise because they were\nshouting too loudly. Loly woke with a\nstart, her eyes still full of fear.\nSeeing this, he asked Loly, \"Oh, Loly,\nyou're awake.\" Loly, dazed, reported to\nher master that there were monsters in\nthe castle. The monsters are very big\nand terrifying. Loly only comes up to\ntheir knees. Loly hugged Sibbon in fear,\nurging, \"We have to run, Master. If we\nrun into the monsters on the way, just\nlet lowly feed them, then Master must\ntake the chance to run for it quickly.\"\nSibbon hugged the little girl tightly\nand joked, \"I don't know if there are\nmonsters in the castle, but right now\nI'm a monster who's going to eat you\nup.\" Lorie rested her head on his chest,\nfeeling somewhat at ease. In the middle\nof the romantic moment, Goodbye burst in\nto announce that an urgent letter had\narrived for you, ruining the good moment\nbetween the two. Seeing the two of them\nbeing intimate, Goodbye also froze,\nfeeling like he had ruined a good thing.\nLorie, being both beautiful and\nconsiderate, said, \"Master, please go\nahead with your work. Lori will leave\nfirst. I still have to go to Miss Chris\nfor my studies. Lorie shily ran out the\ndoor. Goodbye. Explained that he didn't\nsee anything. Didn't see anything at\nall. And that he had left the letter on\nthe floor, my lord. The letter lay\nsprawled on the floor while Sibbon\nangrily yelled, \"Get back here.\" Sib\npointed at goodbye with a look in his\neyes. That's right. The soldiers have\nhad heavy duties recently. You will wash\nthe soldiers underwear and socks for a\nwhole month. He reluctantly rubbed his\nhead and nodded. Yes, my lord. Sibbon\nreached out and picked up the letter\nfrom the table, reading it carefully.\nDear Lord of Eagle Crest, my Black River\nterritory is under attack by beastmen. I\nhope to receive aid from the Lord of\nEagle Crest, neighboring territory.\nAfter reading, Sibbon's mind was filled\nwith thoughts. He imagined the scene of\nTambo kneeling at his feet, begging, and\ncouldn't be happier, feeling smug. Black\nRiver Territory is being attacked by\nbeastmen. So, this is a letter\nrequesting aid. Black River territory is\nlocated below Eagle Crest territory\nright next to Divine Light Town. It also\nserves as a shield against the beastmen.\nThe principle of when the nest is\noverturned, no egg remains intact is\nsomething I understand very well. I must\ndefinitely help. But I also have to take\nthis opportunity to settle some scores.\nWhile he was busy thinking the system\nnotification popped up, daily villain\nmission has been updated. Villain\nmission one is to steal the socks of any\nhandmaiden in the castle. Villain\nmission two, plunder supplies worth\n10,000 gold coins or more from a\nneighboring territory. Villain mission\nthree, tease the subhuman saints. Sib\nfrowned in annoyance and resentment.\nGreat. This damn system knows I'm about\nto go put Tambo in a tough spot and also\nmeet the players, right? It's even\ndirectly making me go tease the subhuman\nsaints. Lorie was bathing in the tub,\ncomfortably enjoying a relaxing moment.\nSibbon stood outside dressed in black\nwith his face covered, leaving only his\neyes visible, complaining that the damn\nsystem was dumping all its perverted\ntasks on him. A dignified lord having to\nsteal socks. There are a total of two\nhandmaidadens here. I can't steal from\nChris, so I can only steal from Lori. As\nLorie stepped out of the bathtub, she\nimmediately saw Sibbon standing right\nthere. The little girl screamed,\n\"Pervert!\" Lorie, terrified, squeezed\nher eyes shut and cried out, \"Help!\"\nSuddenly, a bath towel was thrown\nstraight into her face. Hearing the cry\nfor help, goodbye, rushed over with a\nfew soldiers. Someone's crying for help.\nHurry up. Sib, hiding in the corner by\nthe wardrobe, complained that it was\ngoodbye again. He doesn't come early. He\ndoesn't come late. Why does it have to\nbe such a coincidence? He slammed the\ndoor open and said loudly, \"What's going\non here? Where's the pervert?\" But the\nscene before him was not what he had\nimagined. Sibbin was caressing Lorie in\nhis arms and comforting her. Don't be\nafraid. I've already chased the pervert\naway. Goodbye. Listen to him scold for a\nwhile. Goodbye. Security in Twin East\nCastle must be strengthened. To think\nyou let a pervert break in ear. If this\nlord hadn't driven him away in time, the\nconsequences would be unimaginable.\nTaking that opportunity, Sibbon took\nfurther revenge. It seems that making\nyou wash underwear and sock for a month\nwas a bit too light. Now I'm increasing\nit to 3 months. You don't have any\nobjections, do you? Goodbye. could only\naccept and reply, \"No objections.\" He\nbreathed a sigh of relief for not being\ndiscovered. Otherwise, his lifetime of\nintegrity would have been ruined.\nHearing this, Lorie smiled and whispered\nin his ear, \"Actually, Master doesn't\nneed to be so sneaky. If you like them,\nLorie can just give them to you,\nMaster.\" Sibbon broke out in a cold\nsweat. Wait, she hasn't discovered\nsomething, has she? Lori, let me\nexplain. At this moment in Black River\nTerritory, the leader of Black River\nTerritory, Tambo, was holding Sib's\nreply letter. He was angrily shouting at\nhis subordinates about the things Sibbon\ndemanded in exchange for helping fight\nthe Beastman tribe. But what made the\nold leader of Black River so furious\nthat he cursed Sibbon as a bastard was\nthat he dared to say if he couldn't\nprovide the things Sibbon demanded, he\ncould write an IOU. After saying this,\nthe leader of Black River Territory tore\nSibbon's reply letter to shreds. Tambo\nwas furious and said that if Black River\nterritory falls, the next place to face\ndisaster would be Eagle Crest territory.\nDoesn't Sibon know that? As soon as he\nfinished speaking, the leader of Black\nRiver Territory kicked a close\nsubordinate, sending him tumbling to the\nground. In his hand now was a sword with\na dazzling light. As he approached the\nsubordinate, he uttered threats because\nDAC had dared to secretly cut taxes\nbehind his back. If he couldn't come up\nwith a solution today, he would have his\nhead rolling in the fields. DAC with a\ntrembling voice leaned close to the ear\nof the Black River territory leader. to\npropose his dirty scheme, which greatly\npleased the old man. On the other side,\nSibbon had already ridden out with his\nentire army to quell the Beastman tribes\nrebellion with a brilliant aura\nspreading across the map. After\ntraveling for a while, Grimman the\nbutler felt that something was wrong.\nAccording to the original objective,\nthey were supposed to go reinforce Black\nRiver territory, but the direction they\nwere heading was towards Divine Light\nTown. Sibbon explained that the beastmen\nare fierce and skilled in combat. If\nthey went now, they would just get\nbeaten up. So now we're going to Divine\nLight Town to borrow arrows with\nstrawboats. Sibbon's answer made butler\nGrimman wonder silently. He thought that\nyoung master Sibbon was having one of\nhis fits again and talking nonsense.\nNonsense at Divine Light Town. Another\nplayer named Lynn Fan was gambling\nhappily with other guards on the city\nwall. They talked about the easy life\nsince capturing Divine Light Town. All\nthey had to do was sit around and wait\nfor the time to come, then go see the\nsaintest to collect their reward without\nany effort. While they were all immersed\nin the joy of idleness, Sibbon appeared\nbehind them. In a teasing tone, he said,\n\"Gambling on the city wall, neglecting\nyour duties, aren't you?\" The\nblond-haired soldier replied, \"You can't\ndo missions for a lifetime. You can't\nlevel up, and you don't get good\nequipment, so we just hide on the city\nwall and gamble the days away.\" Sib\nsaid, \"What if the Lord of Eagle Crest\ncomes here again? What would you do?\"\nThe blond-haired man replied again with\na mocking tone. If that lord of eagle\ncrest comes here, I'll take him down. As\nsoon as he finished the sentence, Sibbon\nslammed the sword in his hand down right\nnext to where the blondhaired man was\nsitting, kicking up dust all around his\nfeet, then lightly sat down, placing one\nhand on the sword. He placed his other\nhand on the blond-haired soldier's\nshoulder. Sib gave a slight smile and\nsaid, \"Go on, try and take me down.\"\nThis sentence made Lynn fan and the\nothers gasp in horror. The blondhaired\nman's face turned purple and he was\nspeechless. After composing themselves,\nLynn Fan and his group announced to all\nthe soldiers and citizens in the city.\nThe Lord of Eagle Crest is here for\nbusiness again. The entire army in the\ncity stood stunned as if they still\nhadn't realized what was happening.\nInside the city's temple, the Saints\nalong with the child of destiny, Yeihow,\nwere shocked and surprised by Sib's\nreappearance. Beads of sweat rolled down\nboth their faces. The saint is clasped\nher hands together, her face sorrowful\nas she lamented to the gods. Oh gods,\nmust my people face war again? As for\nyeh how, in contrast to the sorrowful\nsaintists, he angrily swung his sword. A\nflash of light was seen and a tree was\ncut in two. With an angry expression, he\nsaid, \"I haven't even come looking for\nyou, and you've come looking for me,\nLord of Eagle Crest. Today I will show\nyou the consequences of daring to mess\nwith me. Yeiha. An army in solemn\nhelmets and armor with cold expressions\nstood waiting for orders after Yeihow's\narrogant declaration. Up on the city\nwall, Sibbon remained nonchalant as if\nnothing had happened. His hand holding\nthe sword pointed straight at Lynn fans\ngroup. Following behind him was his bull\ndemon king army. In a simple room inside\nthe city, outside the window was a crowd\nof people watching the drama unfold. The\nroom was filled with a somber atmosphere\nof frightening silence. To break the\natmosphere, Sibbon crossed his legs,\nstated the purpose of his visit today,\nand made a proposal in a pleasant and\ncheerful tone. In contrast to Sibbon's\ncalm and cheerful demeanor, Saint Rueer\nas if she had springs on her bottom,\nshot up from her chair, and slammed her\nhand on the table. Her face showed clear\nanger at Lord Sibbon's proposal. At this\npoint, Sibbon saw that negotiation was\nimpossible and decided to lay his cards\non the table with Ruer. Sibbon stood up\nand moved close to Ruer, suppressing her\nrecent angry momentum. With a stern\ngaze, he said, \"This is me ordering you\nand your army to comply, not coming to\nask for your opinion. Rui and her\ncompanions can negotiate terms with me,\nbut you have no right to refuse.\nOtherwise, I will raise Divine Light\nTown to the ground and throw you and\nyour subhuman tribe out into the\nfields.\" Sibbin continued as if\nreminding Ruer that Divine Light Town is\ncurrently a part of Sibbin's Eagle Crest\nterritory, not the subhuman tribes.\nRueer, with a faint light of a saint,\nher face somewhat resentful, retorted to\nSibbin's assertive reminder. This place\nwas also once the country of the\nsubhumans, so I'm only asking for a home\nfor my people to live in. Why is such a\nsmall request of mine so difficult for\nSib to grant? Sib said in a mocking\ntone, \"Rue, you are so naive and\nadorable. The subhuman nation was\ndestroyed long ago. All the land now\nbelongs to me, and I have no obligation\nto give Divine Light Town to you and\nyour bunch of subhumans.\" Sibbon then\nraised his hand to lift Rua's chin and\nteased. If Rua agrees to follow me,\nenjoy my herum, Sibbon will consider not\nusing your subhuman tribe as cannon\nfodder in the upcoming battle, and\nSibbon might even give you the entire\ndivine light town. At this moment, the\nsystem appeared and announced that\nSibbon's mission to tease the subhuman\nsaints was complete. Interrupting\nSibbon's teasing, Yeiha rushed forward\nwith the I've had enough of you look on\nhis face, thinking he would teach Sibbon\na lesson to show off in front of the\nSaints and the crowd of onlookers\noutside the window. In response to\nYihow's posturing, Sibbon just glanced\nat him with sharp eyes and casually\nswung his hand. How could he possibly\nblock it? It sent Yiha tumbling to the\nground before he could even react. The\nslap left a bright red handprint on\nYiha's face. Yihow fell unconscious,\ndrool splattering all over the floor.\nSib once again taunted Yihow. It's only\nbeen a few days and you're already\nmissing Sibbon slap. This was\naccompanied by a reminder to everyone in\nthe room not to forget that he still had\nan entire army of large imposing bullmen\nwaiting outside for his command. Sibbon\ndidn't want to argue with Ruer and her\nsubhuman tribe anymore, deciding to\nrepeat himself one last time. Either her\nsubhuman tribe acts as cannon fodder for\nSibbon and he will agree to Ruer's\nconditions, entrusting Divine Light Town\nto her, or they could wait for his bull\ndemon king army to level the entire\nDivine Light Town, giving her and all\nthe subhumans 10 minutes to think. As he\nspoke, Sibbon turned and walked towards\nthe door, casually throwing something he\nhad just used to wipe his hands onto the\nground. The drop was so powerful, it\ncreated a trail of white smoke as it\nfell. At this point, the group of\nsubhumans in the room waited until\nSibbon's figure was out of sight before\napproaching to see what he had just\nthrown. Ah, it turned out to be a white\nsock. They all felt that Sibbon was a\nreal pervert for using a sock that had\nalready been worn to wipe his hands.\nFeeling extremely embarrassed for\nmistakenly using a sock instead of a\nhandkerchief to wipe his hands, but not\nwanting to lose face, nor let the\nbrilliant aura he had created so far\nfade. Sib still calmly walked outside\nunder the gaze of the subhuman tribe. He\nreassured himself inwardly, \"Stay calm.\nAs long as you're not embarrassed,\nothers will be.\" While he was feeling\nso, so so very embarrassed, another\nplayer suddenly appeared and blocked\nSibbon's path. This player's name was\nAvatar, a level one apprentice mage.\nAvatar said they agreed to the condition\nSibbin had proposed, but in return,\nSibbon also had to agree to their\ncondition to return to Vine Light Town\nand swear to the gods that he would not\ntake it back. Sibbin smirked and asked,\n\"Avatar, is this the will of the\nsubhuman subjects or the will of the\nSaints?\" Avatar pointed at Sibbon, who\nwas standing in front of him, placed a\nhand on his hip, and said loudly, \"Their\nwill is also the will of the Saints.\"\nSib then let out a sigh of relief and\nsaid, \"All right, although I don't\nfollow any faith, I will swear on my\nhonor as a knight. If the subhuman tribe\nis willing to fight for me with all\ntheir heart and soul, I will return\nDivine Light Town to them after the\nbattle is over.\" After speaking, Sibbon\nmade a fist and lightly thumped it\nagainst his chest. the thump making an\naudible sound to represent the promise\nmade on his own honor. On the other\nside, Avatar suddenly remembered the\nrumors about Sibbon and threw words at\nhim like a splash of cold water, having\nheard that the Lord of Eagle Crest was\nnot someone who cared about a knight's\nhonor as Sibbon had been pretending to\nall this time. In situations like this,\nall Sibbon needed was a confident smile,\na hand on his chest, and the radiating\nlight of a villainous star. He continued\nto defend himself. First I was a knight,\nthen a lord, and finally I became an\nearl. So Sibbon will use his own life to\nprotect the honor of a knight. From\ninside the room, Ruer spoke up and ran\nout. The people in the room now watched\nher every movement with surprised eyes\nunder the sunlight that caressed her\nskin. Her hair under the headscarf\naccentuated her saintly beauty. Ruer\nplaced one hand on her chest as if to\nexpress that what she was about to say\ncame from her whole heart. She knew that\neveryone in the subhuman tribe was doing\nthis for their territory, but not\neveryone needed to agree to sacrifice\ntheir lives like this. As she spoke,\nRuer extended her other hand as if\ndemonstrating the heart of a leader. I\nam a saintist. I will certainly not\nstand by and watch all the subhumans\nwalk into danger. From inside the house,\nan objection also came from Yeihow.\nAlthough the five-finger mark from\nSibbon's earlier slap was still visible\non his face, although everyone can be\nrevived after death, their power will be\nseverely reduced. At that point, how can\na subhuman tribe fight against the boss?\nYiha walked into the middle of the\nsubhuman tribe, saying as he went, \"They\nwere all summoned by him.\" So Yiha will\nnot allow the subhuman tribe to join the\nteam of Sibbon. Sib leaned in and\nwhispered to Rui, \"You don't manage this\nplace too badly. It's just that you have\ntoo many trash teammates around you.\"\nThis made Yihow's blood boil with anger,\nbut he suddenly saw Sibbon extend his\nhand and smile sinisterly. Yihow\nimmediately use his hand to cover the\ncheek that had just been caressed by\nSibbon, which still bore the red five\nfinger mark. At this moment, all players\nin the area received a notification from\nthe system. Mission to follow the lord\nof Eagle Crest, Sibbin, and quickly\nreinforce Black River territory. All the\nplayers were surprised because they had\nbeen the game for a long time and had\nnever seen a boss who could also assign\nthe missions. Thus, Sibbon's goal of\nfinding reinforcements to fight the\nbeastmen was accomplished. Sibbin,\nmounted on his horse with sword in hand,\nadvanced with his army towards Black\nRiver Town. At Black River City, the\nlord of Black River along with his close\nattendant and all the subjects in the\ncity came out to welcome Sibbin and his\nreinforcement army. Sibbin had just\ndismounted, his feet not yet fully on\nthe ground when the Black River leader\ncame before him. Welcoming Sibbin and\nhis army to Black River, thanking him\nfor Sibbin's timely reinforcement.\nSibbon just tossed the horse's reigns to\nthe Black River leader, gave a cold him\nand walked straight inside, leaving him\nalone, and even the horse beside him\nthrew him a look of disgust, leaving him\nstanding there stunned, still not\nknowing what was happening. Inside the\npalace, Sibbon was sitting with his\nhands clasped in front of his chest and\ntold the lord of Black River, Tambo,\nthat he didn't have much time to waste\nwords with Tambo, so he should now\nreport all information related to the\nbeastmen tribe to Sibbon. The lord of\nBlack River, Tambo, clasped his hands in\nfront of his chest in a gesture of\nobedience and said to the guard,\n\"Quickly bring the relevant item for\nSibbon.\" The soldier was gone for a\nwhile, then brought a map, spread it out\nin front of Sibbon, and said to him,\n\"This is the map of Black River\nterritory.\" And three days ago, an army\nof the Beastmen tribe came to invade and\ndestroyed almost this entire place.\nLooking at the map, the guard said near\nBlack River territory, there's a village\ncalled Kedar, where more than 6,000\nBeastmen tribe soldiers are currently\nstationed, and the human race has about\n50 people. This army is extremely\nmobile. Black River has sent troops to\nattack many times but always failed. The\nguard pointed to a corner of the map and\nlisted names like Wild Dog, Loser, and\nIronstone as the names of villages near\nBlack River that had not yet been\noccupied. Sibbon rested his chin on his\nhand with a thoughtful expression as if\ndevising some plan for the upcoming\nbattle related to Ironstone Village.\nScene changed to Ironstone Village. In\nthe distance, a mountain range is hazy\nin the mist. Below is a sparkling\nturquoise river reflecting the sunlight\nflowing from the canyons at its source\ndown to the lower reaches. It divides a\nlush green prairie into two separate\nbanks with two different tribes living\non them. A soldier from the Beastman\narmy rushed frantically into a tent\nannouncing that the human tribes army\nhad attacked their camp. The Beastman\ntribe leader Blood Fong was sitting and\nholding a very large leg of meat after\nhearing the news from his subordinate.\nHis expression was surprised. How could\na human tribe know where his beastman\ntribe was located? On the other side of\nthe river, Sibbin along with Butler\nGrimman and Tambo of Black River were\nstanding and looking towards the\nBeastman camp. Tambo suddenly spoke up\nand asked Sibbon why he knew the\nBeastman army was hiding in Ironstone\nVillage. Hearing this, Sibbon lowered\nhis binoculars, turned to Tambo, and\ncalled him an idiot. Then he told Butler\nGrimman to tell Tambo his thoughts.\nButler Grimman in his elegant suit\nraised one finger and said that\nIronstone Village is near Blackstone\nTown with the advantage of waterways\nthat can transport more supplies than\nthe other two villages and it is also a\nconvenient route for an attack if one\nfollows this river. Facing Sibbon now\nwas a beast tribe cavalryman from the\nother side of the battle line riding a\nwhite wolf and relaying the words of\nleader Bloodfong who would give Sibbon\nand his army a chance to live if Sibbon\nagreed to surrender immediately. On this\nside, due to the difference between\nhumans and beasts, Sibbon had a blank\nface because he didn't understand what\nthe other side was yelling at all. At\nthis moment, Tambo's green-haired\nconfidant, DAC, took the opportunity to\nflex about himself, having graduated\nwith honors from the Butler Academy, and\nasked for permission to interpret. In\nthe middle of his sentence, Sibbon cut\nhim off, raising a hand and mercilessly\nrefusing. After speaking, Sibbon drew an\narrow and pulled his bow taut. The\nbrightly glowing arrow was charged for a\nlong time. Sibbin suddenly released the\narrow before the astonished eyes of the\nBeastman cavalrymen. The arrow flew\nstraight into the middle of the Beastman\ncavalryman's forehead, knocking him off\nhis mount. Falling backward, seeing his\nkinsman fall dead at his feet, the\nBeastman leader angrily raised his\nweapon and charged with his comrades to\nprepare for battle with the command\nstrawberry syrup and glory to the\nBeastman Legion, kill all humans. Now on\nthe vast green prairie under the harsh\nsun, both armies of Sibin and the\nBeastmen were preparing for a fierce\nclash to break out. The Beastman tribe\ncharged forward with a mix of roars and\ngrowls and the deafening sound of horns,\ndisplaying their blood lust. On this\nside, Sibbon calmly observed every step\nof the Beastman tribes advance. 100\npaces, then 80 paces. In contrast to\nSibbon's calm and composed demeanor,\nTambo was sweating bullets, frightened,\nand gritted his teeth, saying, \"The\nBeastman tribe is attacking. What should\nwe do?\" Realizing the time was near, Sib\nfinally gave the order for the entire\narmy to prepare to engage. Archers,\nprepare to fire. Following that, the\nmagic core of the mutant tribe, attack\nfreely with your magic. As soon as\nSibbon's command ended, red streaks like\nmeteors could be seen in the sky,\nhurtling towards the Beastman tribe and\nthe goblin army. They could only stare\nblankly at the sky. Their faces dazed as\nif they still didn't know what was\nhappening until every arrow, every wave\nof magic landed in the middle of their\nformation, and the Beastman tribe\nfinally realized they were being\nattacked. One by one, they fell with\nterrified screams. Sib's army charged\nforward bravely. One goblin was struck\nby a player with an axe. In the torso,\nwhile another was pierced through the\nchest by a sword, screaming in pain.\nFrom behind the ax wielding player, a\ntall six-packed beastman appeared with\neyes as red as syrup, long and ferocious\nfangs, using the great bamboo splitting\ntechnique. Sibbin, along with Grim and\nTambo, stood behind the battle lines,\nobserving the fierce battle unfolding.\nNoticing the situation was not\nfavorable, Sibbon looked towards Tambo\nand invited him to lead his night legion\nto charge forward with Sibbon's army to\ndrive out the Beastmen. Sibon added that\nif Tambo dared to pull any tricks in\nthis battle, his fate would be worse\nthan that of the Beastman tribe. This\nmade Tambo sweat bullets, his hands\nclenching and unclenching non-stop as he\nrepeatedly exclaimed, \"No, no!\" Sibbon\nshouted, \"Fortress of glory!\" A golden\nlight enveloped Sibbon. The entire army\nwas now bathed in Sibbin's aura. Their\ndefense and attack power greatly\nincreased. Sibbin, now looking like a\ntrue lord, said, \"Knights, follow me and\ncharge into the enemy's tents.\nSwordsmen, follow behind and launch\nsneak attacks. Everyone be careful and\nwatch out for encirclement by the\nBeastman tribe soldiers. The entire army\nin unison raised their flags and\nweapons, shouting as one.\" The roar\nechoed across the sky. The shout seemed\nto make their morale sore even higher.\nSibbin, sword in hand, charged forward.\nA streak of light shaped like a\nlightning bolt, was seen trailing behind\nSibbon, piercing through the goblins\nbodies and splitting them in two. Behind\nSibbon, the chieftain of the Beastman\ntribe appeared. He rode a lion slowly\napproaching Sibbon. A deadly aura\nemanated from the Beastman chieftain,\ndying the scene red. The system\ndisplayed the Beastman chieftain's\ninformation. name is Biden, commonly\nknown as Bloodfong, a tribal chieftain.\nLevel 42. Sibbin and Bloodfong charged\nat each other. At this moment, only the\nsound of weapons clashing remain. Sparks\nflew with each impact, just when it\nseemed the battle would be intense. In\nless than three moves, Bloodfong was\nsent flying by Sibbon's sword. His\nweapon was also knocked into the air.\nAlthough defeated at Sibbon's feet,\nBloodfong still spoke aggressively.\nAlthough Sibbon is very strong, Sibbon's\narmy is gradually being depleted. The\nBeastman team's reinforcements are still\nnumerous. After speaking, Bloodfong took\nout a small white horn. Realizing\nBloodfong intended to call for more\nallies, Sibbon wanted to stop Bloodfong,\nbut it was too late. Bloodfong held the\nhorn and blew a long note, and a red\ncircle appeared. From the void, a giant\nbeast with red eyes and long, ferocious\nfangs slowly emerged. An unlucky knight\nwas caught by it and could only cry out\nmiserably. Cries of help, help rang out,\n\"Help! Save me!\" But everyone around\ncould only stand there stunned and\ngaping in fear by the gods above. They\nwondered, \"Aren't they supposed to be in\nthe northern lands?\" Just like that, the\nunfortunate fellow became its prey, torn\nto shreds. Its name is Bimman. Status is\nyoung or common. Bman skills include\ndevour, attack, annihilate, trample,\nberserk, no equipment. Monster\nreputation reached 43,621.\nThe young empire in the northern lands\nhad these behemoths etched into their\nmemory. Ever seen Satan's minions?\nThat's them. Meanwhile, Sibbon was\nfighting wearily. Heavens, there are\nseven of them. The faces of the knights\ndarkened as they hurriedly spoke. My\nlord, you must retreat quickly. He\ncalculated in his mind, I don't have\nmuch battle aura left. Knights without\nbattle aura are significantly weakened.\nI can't stay here any longer. I must\nbreak the encirclement. Therefore, he\nloudly commanded everyone all nights.\nHear my order with me as the center.\nBreak out of the encirclement. After\nspeaking, he moved as fast as lightning,\ncutting down three beastmen at once.\nThen turned to this side to eliminate\nthe remaining beastmen, sending blood\nflying everywhere. Holding his sword,\nhis whole body emitted an increasingly\nbrilliant light of power. Don't linger\nhere any longer. A worried knight looked\nat him. But my lord, what about you? But\nfacing a critical situation, he no\nlonger cared about himself and only\nwanted to focus on annihilating these\ndemonic beasts. You all retreat first.\nI'll stay here to buy you time. He\nthought to himself, \"Come on, they\nshould be arriving soon.\" The army of\nespers was trying to use all their\nstrength for this battle. A person with\na bow and arrow on the other side\nshouted, \"Damn it, Lord Eagle Crest,\ndon't you die. Your life must be safe\nfor us to get a gold drop. A girl asked\nwhile throwing a punch. Where are those\nbullheaded people? The young man\nstanding nearby replied. I don't know.\nMaybe they were blocked by other\nBeastman troops. Haven't seen them at\nall. Loud noises rang out. A bullheaded\nman with an ax brutally chopped a\nbeastman in half. And so they charged\nforward aggressively. Strength and\nloyalty. The giant Bman was about to\nraise its claws to annihilate the\nbullheaded man in front of it. But\nunexpectedly, the bull-headed man was so\nstrong that he held its claws tightly to\nstop it. Blatclan. The bull-headed man's\neyes were terrifyingly crimson as he\ngrowled. Let us deal with these\novergrown forest dwellers. Everyone\nfighting was confused when they suddenly\nheard something crash heavily to the\nground. Uggh. What's happening? It\nturned out the bull-headed man had\nquickly dealt with the bimman, causing\nit to fall to the ground unconscious.\nCome on, you big oaf. Get up. Its\nappearance made everyone extremely\nexcited. It's the bull-headed people.\nThe bull-headed people have come to\nkill. Biden witnessed this and became\nmore anxious. Where did those\nbull-headed people come from? Why have I\nnever seen them in the Beastman tribe?\nHunchback Wolf, go investigate for me\nimmediately. However, after calling\nrepeatedly with no response, he turned\nhis head in confusion. Hunchback Wolf,\nsuddenly a voice cut him off. Don't call\nanymore. That person was none other than\nCome on. He held a sword to his neck and\nannounced, \"He's already dead. It's all\nover.\" The news stunned him. \"What? The\nbattle was finally over.\" Everyone\ncheered with delight. \"We won. We won.\nThankfully, we have the brave and\nskilled Lord Sibbon. Black River City\nwill forever open its gates to welcome\nyou.\" Suddenly, Tambo hurriedly\napproached, calling, \"Your Excellency\nthe Count.\" He was happily riding his\nhorse on the way and saw him and smiled.\nLord Tambo. Before he could speak, Sib\nlaughed and teased. What's the matter?\nIn a hurry to settle the debt, his face\nwas covered in sweat, startled. Your\nexcellency, the count, this great\nvictory is thanks to you. It's just that\nthis Black River territory of mine is\ntruly small. I can't gather 10,000 gold\ncoins and 500 sets of equipment. Sibbon\nhelplessly and silently held the paper,\nlistening to him ramble on. But I have\nalready written an I owe you. This time\nI will pay 5,000 gold coins, 20 sets of\nstandard armor, and provisions in\nadvance. The rest will be paid in full\nwithin a year. You see, in in addition,\nthis humble one has another unreasonable\nrequest. Could you hand over the\nbeastman chieftain for me to handle? He\nhas caused too much bloodshed in Black\nRiver territory. I must summon the\nthief's people for a public trial. After\nwaiting for him to finish, Sibbon just\nsighed and replied curtly, \"As you\nwish.\" Next, he asked, \"We have already\narranged the victory banquet. Are you\nreally not attending?\" But Sibbon just\nwaved his hand, turned, and left. No\nneed. Now, bring out the 5,000 gold\ncoins, equipment, and provisions. I'm in\na hurry. Hearing this, a mysterious\nsmile appeared on his face as he\nreplied, \"Yes, I will immediately have\nthe knights bring the items out for\nyou.\" Inside the prison, Chieftain\nBloodfong, who was captured and locked\nup after battle, suddenly heard someone\ncall, \"Hey, you thing, get up.\" As his\neyes glanced to the side, he was\nstartled by something. Do you recognize\nwhat this is? Seeing Tambo holding a\nbook with strange ominous red symbols,\nhe recognized it immediately. This is\nthe earthquake technique scroll that\nonly a beastman chieftain can activate.\nHe smiled and explained, \"This was my\nfather's spoil of war from killing a\nbeastman chieftain. If DAC hadn't\nreminded me, I wouldn't have even known\nthis thing existed, let alone that it\ncould be useful today.\" He looked at him\nand asked a rather strange question. Are\nyou so sure I would definitely lose the\nbattle like that? Upon hearing this,\nTambo became extremely arrogant and\nlooked at him with contempt. I wasn't\nsure you would be defeated, but if I\ndidn't have this scroll and you were\ndefeated, I would have to give that\nbastard 10,000 gold coins. At this\npoint, he didn't hesitate to reveal his\nintentions. If you had one, both he and\nI would have died. But I have this\nscroll. You also failed. Now I live and\nhe dies. His words made him jump to his\nfeet. You truly are decisive, Lord.\nSeeing him say this, Tambo thought he\nhad agreed to side with him and was\noverjoyed. So, you agree to help me use\nthis scroll. If you agree to cooperate\nwith me, I can spare your life. But\nBiden said, \"No need. I am very willing\nto lend you my strength to help you use\nthe earthquake technique to kill that\nlord and his army. When it's done, I\nonly hope you can bury me on the\nbattlefield. That is where I belong.\"\nYou just said, \"Deal, if that's the\ncase, follow me.\" But suddenly his\nfinger pointed at the scroll, cutting\nhim off. No need for such trouble to\nactivate the earthquake technique. All\nthat's needed is fresh blood and a\npassage of my Beastman language is\nenough. Looking at the glowing scroll,\nhe couldn't help but feel smug. When he\nstepped outside, he stood above and\nlaughed loudly, making the knights below\njump in surprise. His face revealed a\ncruel expression as he held the now\nactivated glowing red scroll high for\nall to see. Respected Count Eagle Crest,\ngood evening. Now, I must tell you some\nbad news. Star of the nation, second son\nof the Golden Lion family. You are about\nto die. Killed by this activated\nearthquake technique. Saying this, Tambo\npointed at Sib standing below and\nthreatened. I just need to read one\nsentence in the Beastman language. And\nboom, boom, boom. You will all be buried\nunder the earth and sand. It's all your\nfault because of your bottomless greed.\nCount Eagle Crest, Sibon Golden Lion. Do\nyou have any last words now? Respected\nyour excellency, Count Eagle Crest,\nSibon Golden Lion. Despite being\ninsulted by him, Sibbon didn't get angry\nor scared. On the contrary, he gave a\nthumbs up and burst out laughing. My\nlast words, what last words could I\nhave? A good for- nothing piece of trash\nlike you, who doesn't know his place,\nwants to kill me. Those words stunned\nhim. What? His eyes were bloodshot like\na demon's veins popping on his forehead\nfrom excessive anger. Very good. I\noriginally wanted to see your pathetic\nbegging for mercy, but since he won't\nshed a tear until you see the coffin,\nthen die for me. While he wasn't paying\nattention on Sibbon's side, he made a\nslashing motion across his neck with his\nhand. At the same time, a wound\ninstantly appeared on his body and blood\nsprayed out gruesomely, his bloodshot\npupils contracted, his face tensing as\npain washed over him. Suddenly, a knight\nstepped forward and snatched the scroll.\nSorry, Baron to Lambo. You talk too\nmuch. I was really getting impatient. If\nI didn't want to preserve this usable\nearthquake technique scroll, I would\nhave skewered you yesterday. His whole\nbody trembled as he gritted his teeth in\ndisbelief. Why? Why is it you? To\nLambo's voice trembled as he said, I\ntrusted you so much. Not wanting to hear\nany more of his annoying words, the\nknight directly skewered him with his\nsword, causing blood to gush out. I\nunderstand how you feel. After all,\nyou're just a minor baron, so you would\nnever expect that your most trusted\nguard would be a man from the Golden\nLion family, right? His whole body fell\nface down on the ground as he squeezed\nout a few words with his last breath.\nGolden scheme kingdom. After finishing\nthe job, the knight also turned and\nleft. Baron to Lambo, you're\noverthinking things. If you hadn't\nstarted this life and death struggle\nwith young Master Sibon today, I\nprobably would have never killed you in\nthis lifetime. The weather today is\ntruly beautiful with a clear blue sky\nand occasional sunbeams shining down.\nAfter completing his mission, he quickly\nran to Black River territory and called\nout, \"Young Master Sibbon, long time no\nsee.\" Sitting on a chair, he heard the\ncall and said cheerfully, \"Allan, I knew\nit was you.\" When he took off the hat on\nhis head, a mischievous face was\nrevealed as he winked. \"I saved your\nlife this time.\" You know, looking at\nthe person opposite him made him a\nlittle curious. Sure enough, your voice\nis exactly the same as before, not a bit\ndifferent. I recognized it when you were\ndescribing the map, but why did you come\nto Black River Territory? He answered\nhonestly. I came here on the orders of\nhis grace, the Duke. So, he began to\nrecount, I was originally an inside man\nto be activated when necessary, but now\nmy identity as an inside man is\ndiscarded. This made him rest his chin\non his hand, his face wrinkling\nslightly. An inside man. What does\nfather want to do? Suddenly his\nexpression turned grim. Young Master\nSibbon, the king is old. There are some\nthings he can no longer avoid putting on\nthe aphenda. His attitude made him think\nin astonishment. Although I don't know\nthe specific situation, I just hope my\nnominal father, Duke Manhattan, doesn't\nkick the bucket. After all, he treats me\nquite well. So he suddenly spoke up.\nAllan, listen to this. Hearing this, he\nbecame a little curious. After a moment,\nAllan's surprised voice echoed so loudly\nthat it scared a bird outside in a\nflying away. You're saying the blood of\nthe subhuman maiden is used to nurture\nthe holy relics of the temple knights?\nHow can that be? His over-the-top\nreaction made Sibin face bomb,\nspeechless. Can't you lower your voice a\nbit, Mr. Spy? Not knowing what was on\nhis mind, he hardly jumped to his feet\nin haste. In that case, I won't linger\nhere any longer. His voice full of\ndetermination was like a promise to him.\nThis time when I return to the royal\ncapital, I'll take the head of Biden\nblood fong and present it to the king on\nyour behalf. I reckon the king will\ngrant you Black River territory as a\nreward this time. Having no other\nchoice, he could only agree with what he\nsaid. Got it? You can go. Sibon and\nKaman stood proudly before Tambo's gold\nvault, hearing sounds coming from\nwithin. The brilliant sparkling light\nthat radiated out made him gawk. in\nsurprise. His eyes shining like\nheadlights, greedily stared at the gold\npiled up like a mountain inside. So much\nmoney in this gold vault and that Tambo\nguy pretended to be poor with me. Come\non, take it all. He immediately accepted\nthe order. Yes, young master. The wheels\nquickly started moving. Outside the\nprocession of knights, each on horseback\npulling a card of gold coins behind\nthem, departed. Looking at that gold\nmade everyone drool with envy. I feel\nlike we're the most pathetic gamers in\nhistory. I don't even have as much money\nas an NPC. Don't say anymore. It hurts.\nHey guys, if I secretly grab a handful,\nLord Eagle Crest probably won't know,\nright? The system displayed a\nnotification panel. Ding. Detected that\nthe host has completed the daily villain\nmission. Do you wish to draw the reward\nnow? His face satisfied. He thought to\nhimself, \"System, draw the reward. Next\ntime, no need to confirm with me. Just\nopen it directly.\" The prize will\nquickly appeared and then stopped on a\nslot. Congratulations to the host for\nreceiving the curio breath of the wild.\nThis reward has triggered a lucky\ncritical hit. Congratulations to the\nhost for receiving the origin of the\nwild. The reward has been automatically\nintegrated into the host's body. Please\nexperience it for yourself. Watching the\nblue energy slowly coil into a circle in\nfront of him made him wonder system.\nWhat on earth is the origin of the wild?\nThe system heard this and explained the\nworld unique curio origin of the wild is\nthe source of the breath of the wild\nencompassing all types of the breath of\nthe wild. After reading that information\nhe was speechless. That's really saying\nsomething by saying nothing. So what are\nthese all types of the breath of the\nwild and primitive wild feeling anyway?\nThe system continued to display the\ncurio breath of the wild is a rule of\nnatural power. Pure natural beings can\nbased on their differing talents awaken\nthe power within their blood line.\nSeeing this, his face lit up as he began\nto strike a pose. So, can I comprehend\nthe power from within it? I feel like\nI'm very pure, but the system said, \"You\ncannot.\" The answer made Sibbon cross\nhis arms, fuming with anger. So, what's\nthe use of this toy for me? Don't I just\nbecome a human-shaped Wi-Fi hotspot\nbroadcasting the Breath of the Wild?\nHowever, he was still curious system.\nWhat is a pure natural being? The system\ndisplayed an answer. It's not easy to\ndescribe. To give an example, it's the\nhorse the host is currently riding.\nLooking at the creature with its\nsparkling cute eyes made him find it\namusing. My horse. Is there something\nwrong with you? It's true. I like beast\nears, but a horse won't do, let alone a\nmale horse. He stroked his chin, his\nface pensive as he speculated. It seems\nthis is caused by the origin of the wild\naccording to what the system said. I'm\nequivalent to becoming an evolutionary\nopportunity for natural beings, which is\nwhy my horse showed that kind of\nexpression. And since the other horses\naround have no reaction, it seems the\nperception range is limited. As the\nsystem mentioned, whether one can awaken\ntheir bloodline power from the breath of\nthe wild depends on their talent. At the\ntown mayor's mansion in Divine Light\nTown, inside a room, the two sides were\nsitting opposite each other. Rui's face\nwas slightly flushed as she spoke. Lord\nEagle Crest, if you have no objections,\nlet's start drawing up the transfer\ncontract for Divine Light Town now. He\nreached out his hand to take the\ncontract. However, something made his\nexpression fall with a hint of horror.\nFrom within the contract, a tall woman\nwith long white hair, her whole body\nglowing, appeared behind him. The\nblessing of the god of order. The\nappearance of that person left Sibbon\nspeechless. Well, now this parchment\nscroll actually has the blessing of the\ngod of order. Where do these players get\nthis from? My eagle crest territory even\nhas a temple dedicated to that old hag,\nthe god of order. Suddenly, she started\npanting strangely. Her whole body\nflushed red. She gritted her teeth, her\nbreathing becoming rapid as she thought\non Lord Eagle Crest's body. There's such\na comfortable Oh, because of this, she\nfidgeted, pushing herself up from the\ntable. No, I can't hold it in anymore.\nSuddenly, she lunged towards him,\ncausing his jaw to drop in astonishment.\nI want to lick him. I want to rub\nagainst him. This made a young man rush\nover to pull her hand, calling saintis.\nBut fortunately, that was just her\nimagination. The truth was, she had been\nsitting there dazed as if she'd lost her\nsoul, making the young man have to\ncontinuously wave his hand to get her\nattention. Saintis, your highness, the\nsaintest. Only then did Ruer snap back\nto her senses. saw her expression\nflustered. She asked, \"Is something\nwrong?\" Seeing her like this made the\nyoung man also become confused. The\nrestlessness inside her made her feel\nuncomfortable. Combined with her earlier\nfantasy, it made her act even stranger.\nNo me, why am I having such shameful\nthoughts? Although he was thinking,\n\"This NPC is really getting harder and\nharder to handle.\" On the outside, he\nstill maintained a bright smile and\npresented the paper. It's like this.\nLord Eagle Crest has already drafted the\ncontract. Please take a look and if\nthere are no objections, we'll sign. She\nwas startled when she saw the paper.\nRule carefully read every condition\ninside. Hereby all authority of the\nmayor of Divine Light Town, Medin shall\nbe transferred to the subhuman saints\nRue. This includes the right to rule and\nfrom now on the subhuman saint Rue will\nbecome the mayor of Divine Light Town\nfor an indefinite period. However, he\nwas still suspicious and turned to ask\nSibbon Lord Eagle Crest as a count. You\nwouldn't play any word games in the\ncontract, would you? He replied with a\ncasual smile. I am a man who puts\nhonesty first. Next, he looked at the\ntwo of them and said, \"Besides, I am\nalso very clear about the contract. The\nownership of Divine Light Town from the\nformer mayor, Mean, is transferred to\nRue. It's all laid out clearly. Whether\nyou sign or not is up to you.\" However,\nsomething still made her hesitate a\nlittle as it felt a bit strange.\nFinally, she decided to pick up the pen\nand sign. But this parchment scroll is\nprotected by the goddess of order. Any\nviolation will be met with divine\npunishment, so there shouldn't be a\nproblem. As soon as she finished\nsigning, the goddess of order appeared\nagain. He rested his chin on his hand,\nsmiling cheerfully with narrowed eyes.\nThe contract is now in effect.\nCongratulations, subhuman saints. From\nnow on, you are the mayor of Divine\nLight Town. Hearing this, the two people\nsitting opposite were overjoyed.\nHowever, his expression turned cunning.\nWell, then, now is about the right time\nto talk a little about the tax issue of\nDivine Light Town, a vassel town of\nEagle Crest territory. Isn't it? His\nwords left her stunned in disbelief.\nWhat the hell? She was so surprised she\nshot up, slammed her hands on the table,\nand stammered. Tata taxes. In contrast\nto her attitude, he calmly explained,\n\"That's right, taxes. You are the mayor\nof Divine Light Town, and Divine Light\nTown belongs to Eagle Crest territory.\nIt is perfectly reasonable for me to\ncollect taxes from your Divine Light\nTown. Even the goddess of order cannot\npunish me.\" This made her protest\nunhappily, but the ownership of Divine\nLight Town is clearly mine now. But\nthose words were ineffective against\nhim. I'm not saying it's not yours. In\nmy name is the Lord of Eagle Crest. You\nhave indeed obtained the authority over\nDivine Light Town that was once in\nMean's hands. I am the guaranter and\nwitness of this process. His words were\nincredibly tyrannical, but the authority\nyou obtained was Medons, not mine. Rui's\neyes filled with agrieved tears. How\ncould this be? Everyone standing behind\nthem became angry. Damn it. We've been\ntricked, so we still have to pay taxes\nand tribute to Lord Eaglerest. We've\nbeen tricked. Tricked by an NPC. Is this\na game or the real world? This is so\nsurreal. I came here to play the game,\nnot to be played by the game. Suddenly,\nsomeone's footsteps stomped heavily on\nthe ground. Lord Eagle Crest Yehow\nstepped forward to confront him clearly.\nA true gentleman is upright and proper.\nThis action of yours has no benevolence\nor morality whatsoever. It lacks the\ndecorum and style of a lord. You are\nnothing but a despicable and shameless\nvillain. To Sibin, those insults were\nlike a passing wind. The more he heard,\nthe more his ears itched. Whose puppy is\nthis? Barking wildly in front of me.\nLike that. That mocking attitude made\nhim even more annoyed. You Lord Eagle\nCrest, don't be so arrogant. Do you dare\nto duel me oneon-one without any outside\nhelp? If you lose, you must completely\nhand over Divine Light Town to Ruer with\nno interference whatsoever. It will be\ncompletely independent. He agreed\nimmediately without hesitation. Fine.\nthen you also can't use that skill of\nyours that explosively increases your\npower. His face darkened as he sneered.\nI see you don't dare, do you? His voice\ngrew louder as he continued to scold\nhim. Unexpectedly, the great lord of\nEagle Crest is nothing but a coward\nhiding behind others. However, at that\nsame moment, the system appeared again,\nattracting his attention. A new mission\nwas given to you. Daily mission update.\nVillain mission one. Single-handedly\nbeat up Yihow. Villain mission two. Make\nthe subhuman saintis cry. Villain\nmission three. Forcibly kiss the\nsubhuman saintis. After completing this\nmission, besides receiving the daily\nreward, a new function of the system\nwill also be activated. Host, please\ncontinue to advance to become the\nstrongest villain soon. This time after\nreading the mission, his face flushed\nred, looking very excited. What? Looking\nat the innocent girls staring at him\nfrom across, he wondered to himself,\n\"Nice. Does this damn system have a\ngrudge against the saintists? Such a\nperverted mission. I hope the system\ngives me more of these in the future.\nDon't pity me just because I'm a\nhandsome lord. Suddenly, Yeihow's hand\nslammed hard on the table, startling her\nwith confusion. Are you even listening\nto me? It seems his passion was to tease\nhim. Let's just say I was. The answer\nmade him furious. You But he spoke up,\ncutting him off. All right. I agree to a\nduel with you. He thought to himself,\nsince the system has already given the\nmission, then I can't refuse E-How's\nrequest for a duel. Of course, Sibbon\nwouldn't accept so easily an ass back.\nBut what if I win? It can't be that if I\nlose, I have to fulfill your request.\nBut if I win, I get nothing, right? He\nhad no choice but to give into his\nwishes. What do you want? As long as\nit's not too outrageous, I can agree to\nit. However, his added words were\nmysterious and confused him. Your\nagreement alone is useless. A cunning\nsmile appeared on Sibbon's face. Then he\npointed at her and said clearly, \"If I\nwin, I want her.\" Yiha and Ruer\nexclaimed an alarm, \"No way.\" Sib knew\nthey wouldn't agree easily, so he\nswitched to another option. If I win,\nyou have to let me and the subhuman\nsaint be alone for 5 minutes. This plan\nmade Yeha even more displeased. Rui is\nthe subhuman saint. How can she be with\nsomeone like Sib? Not wanting the\nsituation to get more complicated, Ruer\ntugged on Yiha's arm and said\nsubmissively for Yiha to confidently\nagree with Sibbon. She believed he would\nwin the bet. Faced with Ruer's\nexpectations, Yiha finally agreed to\nthis match and promised he was\ndetermined not to lose. At the dueling\nground, the wind howled in gusts. Yiha\nfaced Sibbin, just waiting for the sharp\nclang of two swords clashing. An\nunforgiving battle would begin. Yiha\nmade the first move. Stomping his foot,\nhe powerfully leaped forward and\ndecisively. The blade flashed as a sharp\nclang rang out. Sibbon reacted as fast\nas lightning, his steady sword creating\na perfect counterattack. At the same\ntime, Sibbon spun around and threw a\nkick, mocking Eihow. Is that all the\nstrength you have? Did you not eat\nbreakfast this morning? The attack had\nno effect on Sib. Yihow was pushed far\nback, gripping his blade tightly to\nmaintain his balance. But unexpectedly,\nYihow was prepared for the next move. He\nsuddenly shot forward. In less than a\nsecond, the tip of Yiha's blade was\nright in front of Sibbin's nose. Yihao,\nin a calculated moment, his hand brushed\npast the dagger hidden on his person,\nlaced with poison, that reaper scythe\nwas now next to Sibbin's ear. Sibbin,\nnot expecting this move, said,\n\"Poisoning a dagger, to think yehow\nwould come up with that.\" Eihow\ncunningly replied, \"All's fair in war.\nSurely Sib understands this principle.\"\nNot letting Ehal lecture him further,\nSibbon was determined to regain the\nupper hand. Sibbin plunged his sword tip\ninto the ground, his voice booming. Rise\nfor me. The moment he flicked his sword\ntip into the air, the ground shook along\nwith it. Sibbon's counterattack didn't\ntrouble Yihow. He stepped back to dodge\nthe blow. Is this all you've got? It\nwasn't for nothing that he had been\nrapidly leveling up and training hard in\nswordsmanship lately. Yihow swung his\nsword. His energy surged, executing the\ncrosslight slash technique enhanced\nversion. All his internal energy\ngathered on the blade. The energy shot\nout in a sparkling cross shape. Noticing\nthe change in aura, Sibon gritted his\nteeth, his hand tightening on his sword\nhilt to defend. Despicable airborne\npoison, Sibbon's body was now completely\ndrained of strength. His attendant,\nCrimin, could only watch from the\nstands, nervous and worried, seeing\nSibbon standing completely still because\nthis was a killing move. If it hit, he\nwould die without a doubt. Crimin, with\nhis deep loyalty, couldn't just stand by\nand watch. He drew his sword, intending\nto rush into the arena. A guard stopped\nCrimin. As a knight, you should know\nthis is a duel. No one is allowed near\nthe dueling ground. Sibbin exhaled,\nstanding firm amidst yehow's terrifying\npower. In a flash, Sibbon pulled himself\ntogether, remembering his own status. He\nwas the star of the empire. His pride\nsurged. He was the legendary disciple of\nthe sword saint. Memories of his\ntraining days, the lessons from the\nsword saint flooded back from when he\ncouldn't even lift a sword. In his mind,\nhis master's teachings echoed. Let go of\ndistracting thoughts. Gather all the\nstrength in your body. The words from\nhis memory echoed. Open your eyes and\ntry again. Sib took a deep breath. His\neyes slowly opening, Sibbon raised his\nsword high like a brilliant flash of\nlightning. The light from the blade\nilluminated every corner of the arena.\nSibbin shouted loudly as he brought it\ndown in a perfect arc, his internal\nenergy promising to be no less than the\nwave of energy from Yeihow in front of\nhim. Rue clasped her hands to her chest,\ntears welling in her eyes. Please,\nGoddess of the wild, protect brother\nYeihow. Sibbin's sword strike was\nreaching its end. The prayers still\nechoing in Ruer's mind. Brother Yiha\nmust be safe and sound as the last of\nthe energy was released from the blade.\nDroplets of dark red blood also sprayed\nfrom Sib's mouth. His attendant Crimman\ncouldn't hide his worry for his young\nmaster. While the arena guard\nimmediately looked over at Yihow on the\nopposite side. Just as the guard feared,\nYihow collapsed at the feet of the sword\nsaint successor. The light in his eyes\nfading. The sword energy is too strong.\nFrom a moment he realized he couldn't\ndodge Sibbon's counterattack until now.\nYiha had been so scared his legs\ncouldn't move. Everything became blurry\nbefore his eyes. Yiha knew this weak\nresistance was feudal. In agony, Yiha\ngritted his teeth, his heart filled with\nresentment and helplessness. He dropped\nhis sword and knelt on the ground,\nforced to accept the fact that he had\nlost. From the stands, a mix of mockery\nand shock. Holy crap. The main character\nactually knelt. Did he really lose?\nRuer, with tears streaming down her\ncheeks and panting in panic, ran over,\ncalling out brother Yiha's name. Are you\nokay? Sib raised his hand to block Ruer,\nwho was trying to rush to Yiha's side.\nHe reminded her of the situation. You\nguys lost? Shouldn't you fulfill your\npromise? Ru froze at Sibbon's words. But\neven Sibbon didn't expect she had one\nlast trick, a girl's special privilege.\nSibbon jumped back a step, waving his\nhands and saying she couldn't do that.\nRule burst into tears, sobbing. The\nenraged subhuman people said that\nbastard Sibbon is not allowed to bully\nour saint his sister. Before Sibbon\ncould even move, he was swarmed by them.\nIf you want to harm her highness, the\nSaints, you'll have to step over our\ndead bodies. Sibbin had never expected\nthis situation. However, if they wanted\nit, he would oblige. Sibban reached for\nthe sword on his back, thinking to\nhimself, \"They dare to pull this trick\non me.\" Ruer finally calmed down. She\nstood up to protect her people. Her\nvoice stern, \"Don't kill them.\" She\nknelt at Sibbon's feet, choking back so\nI'll agree to your terms. Sib and\nsheathed his sword behind his back, his\nexpression nonchalant. He helped Ru up,\nhis tone seemingly gentler. \"I just want\nto talk privately with your saintist for\n5 minutes. It's not a life or death\nseparation. Do you all need to be this\ndramatic? He led Rua into the palace,\nclosing the door and leaving a sentence\nbehind. If you don't trust me, you can\nstand guard outside. Sibbon stopped in\nthe wide corridor, suddenly pinning Ruer\nagainst the wall. Ignoring the fear\nbefore him, Sibbon grabbed Ruer's wrist,\npressing her hand tightly against the\ncold stone wall. In a passive position,\nRuer cried out, \"What do you want to do?\nDidn't you say you just wanted to talk?\"\nSibbon's treacherous expression was\nclear. \"Oh, did I say that?\" He leaned\nclose to Ruer's face and whispered, \"Why\ndon't I remember?\" Ruer was pinned\nagainst the wall, her heart pounding,\nher hands gripping the cold wall behind\nher. Sib lowered his head, his breath\ngentle as he placed a kiss on Ruer's\nlips. Rule shook her head repeatedly, as\nif that would help her deny the kiss\nthat just happened. Sibbon was just\nwondering why the system hadn't\nannounced the mission's completion yet.\nSibbon leaned close to Ruer's ear and\nwhispered, \"I suggest you cooperate.\nYour highness, the Saints, you don't\nwant the subhumans outside to die\nbecause of you, do you?\" Her weak spot\nhit. Rueer could only bite her lip and\nendure it. Tears just rolled down her\ncheeks. She choked out. \"Don't harm\nthem.\" Her recent action had\nsuccessfully helped Sibbon complete the\ndaily mission. Completed, Sibbon was\nsurprised, so all it took was using the\nsubhumans as a shield to make her cry.\nIf he had known earlier, he would have\ndone it long ago. Rule tried to stay\ncalm, but couldn't stop her cat tail\nfrom suddenly appearing from behind her,\nwagging. This feels so good. My body is\nso itchy, she thought. Sibbin, having\nachieved his goal, had no reason to\nlinger. The 5 minutes are almost up. I'm\nleaving now. Hey, Ruer felt her body\nburning up. Don't go. Suddenly, she\nlunged at Sibin, wrapping her arms\naround him. This is the scent. She tried\nhard to kiss his cheek. I won't let you\ngo. Sib used his hand to push her kiss\naway. Ray, still as if under a spell,\nsaid enchantingly, \"I want more.\" Sib\nsassily held up a price sign. \"One kiss\nfor 10 coins.\" He shouted, \"That's\nenough. If you kiss me again, I'll\ncharge you.\" At this, Ruer came to her\nsenses. Her eyes widened as she looked\nat the scene she had just caused. And\nremember nothing. She turned beat red.\n\"Pervert,\" Sibbon replied agrievedly.\n\"Hey, between the two of us, who's more\nlike a pervert?\" Embarrassed, Rui shrank\nback, wrapping her tail and turning\naway. Rule tried to shrink back, using\nher tail to cover her face, not daring\nto meet Sibbon's gaze. But when she\nturned, Sibbin was already gone, leaving\nher alone in the vast sanctuary. Sibbin\noutside the city, riding his horse\ncontentedly didn't forget to remind\nsystem. The mission is complete. I want\nmy reward. Ding. The system is drawing\nthe reward for the host. Congratulations\nto the host for receiving the cat Morgan\nDragon's blood potion. It is regrettable\nthat this reward did not have a critical\nhit. Host, please advance and complete\nmore villain missions to soon become the\nstrongest villain. Sibbon took the vial\nof dragon's blood from the system.\nCurious, what is this toy used for?\nDing. The system explained, \"The Cat\nMorgan dragon's blood potion is a body\nenhancement potion concocted by the\nlegendary apothecary Cat Morgan. The\nmain ingredient is the blood of a red\ndragon.\" Sibbon was excited. Using\ndragon's blood to make a potion sounded\nvery cool and apothecary wasn't even a\nprofession on the can continent. Sibbin\nthought again, \"The things the system\ngives are not bad at all.\" \"System, I\nmisunderstood you.\" He suddenly\nrealized, \"So, you're the real deal.\"\nSibbin opened the cap of the dragon's\nblood vial and inquired. \"So, if I drink\nthis dragon's blood potion, will I turn\ninto a red dragon?\" Ding. The system\nannounced, \"You will not. This is only a\nbody enhancement potion, not a\ntransformation potion. The system\ncontinued to remind host, please use the\ndragon's blood immediately. The potion's\nmedicinal properties will evaporate\nafter leaving the system space. Sibbon\ndidn't hesitate, tilting his head back\nand downing the vial of dragon's blood\nin one gulp. Instantly, his eyes became\ncold and decisive. In that moment,\nSibbon could feel the power of the red\ndragon's lineage flowing through his\nveins. The blood vessels under his skin\nbulged with red streaks like lava, and\nthe muscles on his body became firm and\ntaut. Every movement of sibbons was now\nincredibly fluid. He even had a fleeting\nthought, feeling like he wanted to run\naround naked. The system announced,\n\"This reward has been distributed. A new\nsystem function has been unlocked.\" Sib\nhadn't even had time to fully absorb the\ndragon's blood. When he received the\nnotification, he blurted out, \"A new\nfunction?\" The door burst open and Yihow\nrushed in with a worried expression.\n\"Rue,\" he called out loudly. \"Brother\nYihow,\" Rui&lt;unk&gt;'s voice was tearful.\n\"Are you okay?\" Yihow asked, \"Did that\nbastard do anything to you?\" Yihao\ndidn't notice Rui&lt;unk&gt;'s expression at\nthat moment. A mess of tangled emotions\nin her heart. Rui shouted, \"Get out.\"\nBefore Yiha could grasp the situation,\nhe was pushed out of the palace by her.\nThe crowd outside was also surprised.\nJust a moment ago, she was clearly so\nworried about him. whispering. Even a\nmain character got kicked out. I heard\nthat last time after Lord Eagle Crest\nleft, the Saints stayed by herself. They\nguess Sibbon must have done something to\nher. Then they spoke with scorn and\ncontempt. If someone hadn't lost the\nduel, things wouldn't have come to this.\nThese last words made ye how even\nangrier. Truly, who knows when this main\ncharacter will ever defy the heavens?\nThose taunts just now had struck his\nlast shred of pride. You bunch of frogs\nin a well, what the hell do you know? He\nthought the obsession with his wounded\nhonor. All of it pushed Yeeha to the\nbrink of darkness. He stroed away. I\ndidn't want this either. Eihow held the\ndark box he had just taken out. I didn't\nwant this either. It's all your fault,\nLord Eagle Crest. From the darkness, a\nstrange carving emerged, bulging with an\nancient horror, a fiend that did not\nbelong to any order of this world. The\nfollowing is the introduction of a new\nsystem function for the host. After\nactivating the new function, the host's\nvillainous ax will receive a certain\namount of villain points. The system\nasked him, \"Do you want to accept the\njudge villain points?\" Sib was puzzled.\nThe system explained, \"Villain points\ncan be used to exchange for items in the\nvillain store.\" The villain store is\nupdated once a week. This week's villain\nstore has been updated. Please check it.\nHost Sib opened the villain store to\ntake a look. Sky Knight breakthrough\npotion limited quantity. pulling so many\ntricks and even changing tactics to lure\nhim into doing bad things. It seems this\nsystem wants him to walk the villain's\npath until he's pitch black. So sinful\nthat even the Yellow River can't wash\nhim clean. Sib said sarcastically and\nit's even sold in limited quantities.\nYou're too stingy system. Yet Sibbin's\nfirst thought was of Crimin. Exchanging\nfor this potion would not only help\nCrimin break through to become a sky\nknight, but it could very well also\nincrease his lifespan. Sib calculated\nfor a moment. And besides these, there\nwere also mounts, siege weapons, weapon\nblueprints, and so on. All sorts of good\nthings that could be used to enhance the\narmy strength. Sibbin and his army\ntraveled for three long days and finally\narrived at Eagle Crest. Sibbin cheered\nhappily, as expected. It's most\ncomfortable in my own territory. In\nfront of the city gate, two familiar\nfigures were already waiting. Sibbin\nvaguely recognized the two people. Chris\nand Lorie were holding hands in front of\nthe Eagle Crest Palace. Seeing Sibbon\nhad returned, Lorie couldn't hide her\nemotions. Moss, Master, Sibbon asked,\n\"Were you two doing standing guard at\nthe gate?\" Chris said gently. Ever since\nyoung Master Sibbon left the city,\nlittle Lorie has been sitting here\nwaiting after finishing her studies.\nChris warmly recounted. Lorie would wait\nuntil the fortress bell rang at night\nbefore she was willing to go back. She\nwouldn't listen no matter how he tried\nto persuade her. Sibon affectionately\npinched Lorie's cheek. Is that so? I\ndidn't expect that while I was out\nfighting, \"My little maid at home would\nmiss me.\" Chris said thoughtfully,\n\"Let's save the heart to heart for\nlater. The young master must be tired.\nDinner and the bath are ready. Let's go\nback first.\" Sibbon felt relieved. The\nfeeling of returning home made him sigh\nin contentment. Finally, I can relax.\nWaiting only for that, Lorie rushed into\nSibbon's arms. Master. Lori. Sibbon was\nstartled to see the little girl's face\ncovered in tears. I missed you so much,\nMaster. Sib coaxed her. How about I go\ntake a bath to get clean first, and then\nyou can hug me, okay? I'm all sweaty\nright now. Lord didn't care about that,\nbut Master smells so good. It makes one\nfeel warm. I just want to keep hugging\nyou. Sib Lorie could find him fragrant\nin this situation. Lorie nuzzled her\nhead into Sibbon's chest, sighing\nendlessly. \"The scent is like the wind\nblowing over the fields when my mother\nheld me outdoors to count the stars as a\nchild.\" Hearing that, Sibbon suddenly\nrecalled, \"Smells so good. Makes one\nfeel warm.\" But those expressions were\nall related to the artifact, the breath\nof the wild. It is the law of natural\npower. Pure natural beings can based on\ntheir difference in talent and\nperception awaken the power in their\nbloodline from the breath of the wild.\nThis made Sibbon suspect a truth. Could\nit be that Lori can perceive the breath\nof the wild? Sibbon asked the little\ngirl, \"Lori, have you ever heard of\nsubhumans awakening their bloodline?\"\nLorie recalled when she was little, she\nheard her father say that dozens of\nyears ago, the subhumans were also an\nextremely powerful race. Although the\nsubhuman race has no way to cultivate\nbattleqi, nor do they have any innate\nmagical talent, they can awaken the\nhidden power in their bloodline through\nnatural perception. Lorie hesitated\nbefore continuing. It's just that the\nconditions to awaken this kind of power\nare extremely harsh. It not only\nrequires talent, but also one's own\nenlightenment to resonate with the power\nin the bloodline. Some people were lucky\nenough to awaken the power of water\ncurrents under a waterfall, while others\nfought monsters day after day and\ncomprehended the power of wild beasts.\nThe subhuman race doesn't know what is\nhidden in their bloodline, they can only\ntry one by one, but only a few succeed.\nSibbon realized in that case, as long as\ntheir talent is sufficient, any subhuman\ncould find the breath of the wild that\nresonates with their own bloodline on\nhim. So when Lorie said she felt warm,\nshe must have resonated with some kind\nof breath of the wild on him. In other\nwords, this was where Lori possessed the\nability to awaken the power in her\nbloodline. Sibbon asked excitedly,\n\"Lori, do you remember where your\nclansmen went to perceive nature?\" Lorie\nreplied with a clear and innocent gaze,\n\"I do remember in the past when Lorie\nsaw natural scenery, I would also go to\nperceive it a little, but I always\nfailed in the end.\" Sibbon cherished the\nlittle girl's hand. No, no, he\nexplained. Perhaps it's not because you\ndon't have the talent, but because you\nhaven't found the feeling of resonance\nwith your bloodline. Sibbon suggested,\n\"Why don't you try to perceive the\nbreath that makes you feel so fragrant\nand warm right now? Maybe there will be\na surprise.\" Sibbin's sudden mention of\nthe breath of the wild caught Lorie offg\nguard. Then let Lorie try. She timidly\nagreed. Lorie moved closer and Sibbon\nknelt down and wrapped his arms around\nthe little girl. Lorie closed her eyes\nfor a moment. The scent of the great\nplains full of life force. The smell of\nfresh green grass and wild winds\nsurrounded her. Sibbin's breath had\nawakened a feeling in Lorie that was\nboth primal and powerful. Sibbon\nobserved. Could it be that he had\nsucceeded? This is the hidden ability in\nLorie's bloodline. Sensing it a bit, it\nseems to be a recovery type ability. So,\nam I about to have my own personal\nhealer? The world around Lorie seemed to\nfade. She felt herself sinking down.\nMaster Lori is so sleepy. I suddenly\nfeel very tired. Sibbin carried the\nlittle girl back to her bedroom. Have a\ngood sleep. It seems that using the\ninnate skill of perceiving the breath of\nthe wild is also very mentally draining.\nWatching Lorie sleep soundly, Sibbon\nthought to himself. At this stage, he\nwas more like a nanny. Lorie was fast\nasleep, her hand still clutching the hem\nof Sibbon's pants, refusing to let go.\nSibbon tried to pry her hand off, but\nthe more he tried, the tighter Lorie\ngripped as if afraid of losing the sense\nof security she felt. Sibbon looked at\nLorie, sighed helplessly. There was no\nother way. He had to take off his pants\nso as not to wake Lorie. Just as his\npants slipped down, the door burst open.\nGoodbye rushed into report my lord. His\neyes immediately froze when he saw the\nscene before him. Lorie was sleeping\nsoundly on the bed, her hands still\ntightly gripping the pants Sibbon had\njust taken off, while Sibbon stood\nthere, his lower body clad only in\nunderwear. Sibbon sat opposite Goodbye\nand cleared his throat, \"All right, you\nmay speak.\" Captain Goodbye couldn't\nguess what Sibbon wanted to talk about\nand replied confidently, \"For a great\nman like you, my lord, it's perfectly\nfine to have one or two perverted\nhobbies.\" Sibbin, who had wanted to\nquickly resolve the awkward situation,\nwas driven mad by him. Did I tell you to\nsay that? I'm asking you why you\nsuddenly burst into my room. Goodbye.\nHurriedly tried to fix the situation.\nIt's It's that a farmer discovered an\niron or deposit. Sib's eyes immediately\nlit up with excitement. Iron or really?\nWhere is the iron or deposit located?\nHow far is it from Donglin City? When it\ncame to the location of the iron ore,\nCaptain Goodbye didn't know how to\nreport it. Seeing him hesitate, Sibbon\nasked impatiently. So, is there or isn't\nthere? There is my lord. Goodbye. Spread\na map on the table. Please take a look,\nmy lord. Goodbye. Pointed to the\nlocation of the iron. Or that iron or\ndeposit is not far from us. It's just\nthat it's not within Eagle Crest\nterritory, but on the border between\nEagle Crest territory and Budoin\nterritory and and it's a little closer\nto Budan territory. Goodbye said this in\na hesitant tone. I heard they also know\nabout this iron or deposit. Sibbin,\nhowever, was not worried at all. I\nthought it was something serious. This\nlittle matter is too simple. He directly\nused a feather quill to draw a line\nredividing the territory. Sibbin bluntly\ndeclared this iron or deposit is ours\nnow. Take this map to Viscount Budin. If\nhe doesn't agree, we will declare war.\nHearing about war, Captain Goodbye was\nfired up with fighting spirit. Are we\npreparing for war already? This time I\nmust bravely go to the battle field to\nkill the enemy. Sib said calmly, \"What's\nthe rush? We just got back from Black\nRiver territory. Let everyone rest for 2\ndays. We'll see what move the Buddh,\nthen we'll talk. All right. If there's\nnothing else, you may withdraw. Not only\nwas he not allowed to discuss battle\nplans, Sibbon also gave goodbye the task\nhe hated the most. All right. Washing\nunderwear and socks. Increase it to one\nyear. Sibbon soaked in the hot tub, the\ncomfortable feeling he had been looking\nfor after days away from Eagle Crest. It\nhad been 3 days since he used the\ndragon's blood, and his body had become\nmuch stronger. Now ordinary weapons\nwithout doi could not injure him. Sibbon\nobserved his achievements and status on\nthe system. Rubbing his chin smuggly,\nextremely proud of himself. With two\nmore passive skills, intermediate magic\nimmunity and dragon vein power, he had\nfinally become a sky knight. He noticed\na strange name on the system board,\nBeladen. Where did this blood fong come\nfrom? He examined it carefully,\nrealizing Beladen and Blood Fong must be\nrelated. Close. if not father and son\nthan brothers. It seemed he had to start\nstrengthening the border patrols. Now\nSibbon got out of the bathroom, his body\nstill smelling of steam, his mind still\non weapons and war. If the Beastman\nLegion wanted to directly attack Eagler\nCrest territory, they would most likely\nhave to pass through the Toronto\nMountains or they could only fight a\nbattle in Black River territory. Sib was\nlost in thought, not noticing Lorie had\nwoken up. Lorie, why are you awake? Why\ndon't you sleep a little longer? Lorie\nobediently curled up on the bed,\nprofusely thanking Sibbon. Master at\nLorie's innocent words, Sibbon blushed\nin embarrassment. Lori, do you know how\nto have a baby? Lorie answered naively,\n\"Miss Chris taught me that if I complete\nthe final step of warming the bed, I can\nhave a baby.\" Sibbon covered his eyes\nwith his hand, not knowing how to face\nthis unpredictable teaching. \"Lori,\nyou're still young now. We'll reconsider\nthat later.\" Lorie shook her head\nstubbornly. sit presiding over the\npalace meeting, the head of Buduin\nterritory sat before his generals. He\nclasped his hands together solemnly.\nAccording to recent news from the\nborder, at the junction of our territory\nand the colonial empire, an iron or\ndeposit has been discovered. I have sent\npeople to investigate, and it's\nestimated to be around 800 tons.\nImmediately, the generals around the\nmeeting table all looked up, their eyes\nwide with astonishment. Heavens, is it\ntrue? Doesn't that mean we've struck it\nrich? The Buddhan leader's face quickly\nhardened. But the Earl of the Colonial\nEmpire, Lord of Eagle Crest Sibbin,\nwants to contest this iron ore with us.\nHe spread the map in his hand. This is\nthe border map that Lord Sibbin sent\nsomeone to deliver. The soldiers stood\naround the map speaking out in anger.\nThis is outrageous bullying. According\nto the rules, this iron or belongs to\nBudoan. How dare Eagle Crest come snatch\nit? The Buddhan leader shot up, fury\nevident on his face. He is declaring war\non us, thinking we are a small visounty,\na tiny piece of land that can be\noppressed at will. But can we let him\nbully us like this? The soldiers\ndeclared in unison, \"We cannot.\" The\nBuddhan leader was satisfied. \"Very\ngood. My Buddhan family has been dormant\nfor so many years. We have finally found\na chance to transform ourselves. We\nabsolutely cannot let Sibbon disrupt us.\nThe biggest threat to Budooan is Sibbon\nhimself.\" a great knight. Beside him is\nhis subordinate Grimman, another\nrenowned great knight from Eagle Crest.\nApart from these two, Budoin has nothing\nto fear. To ensure victory in this\nbattle, Budwin had to use onethird of\nthe iron ore's mining rights to borrow\nfrom his lordship, the Earl. Those three\nlord knights are on their way from the\nEarlddom and will arrive at the border\nin a few days. The Buddhan leader said,\nthen placed a hand on his son's\nshoulder. Jeter, you can show every one.\nJeter obeyed his father. He took a deep\nbreath, focused, and immediately the\npower in his body began to surge. A\nstream of green energy slowly spread,\nforming a brilliant aura around Jeter.\nThe concentration of doughqi reached the\npoint of overflowing from the corners of\nhis eyes. This was the sign of a great\nnight. The generals all stared at Jeter\nin amazement. Heavens, this kid Jeter is\nonly 21 and has already become a great\nknight. Congratulations, young Viscount.\nWith Jeter and the iron ore, the rise of\nthe voodoo and family is unstoppable. On\nthe streets of Lind Dong City, Sibbon\nrode on horseback, his hand loosely\nholding the res, letting the horse walk\nslowly. His expression was thoughtful\nand gloomy. Today, I have to test the\nsystems new villain scoring method.\nYesterday, the maid Lorie warmed my bed,\nbut I didn't get any points. Today, I'll\ntry a new method to see if I can trick\nthe system. Sibbin glanced down at the\nroadside. Seeing a familiar figure, he\nsuddenly called out, \"Fat kid.\" The boy\nrecognized Sibbon and cried out an\nalarm. \"It's you, Candy, my lord.\"\nBefore Sibbin could try any villainous\ntricks, the boy crossed his arms, his\nface crumpling. \"My lord, I don't have\nany candy today. Can you Can you please\nnot take it from me? My mom was beaten.\"\nThe boy's tears streamed down his face.\nI have to go buy medicine for my mom.\nBoohoo. Hearing the pitiful situation,\nSibbon comforted the boy. Explain\nclearly and I won't take anything from\nyou. The fat kid wiped his tears with\nhis hand and said resentfully, \"My\nfather died in battle. Your night gave\nmy family a pension, but bad people\nfound out about it.\" The fat kid choked\nup. \"They broke into my house, stole all\nthe pension money, and because my mom\nwouldn't agree, she was beaten.\" Sib\nlooked at him with compassion. \"This\nmatter? Why didn't you and your mother\nreport it to me?\" The boy was timid. He\ndidn't speak because his mother said the\nLord would not punish the master knight\nfor this matter. The afternoon sun cast\ntheir two shadows. The distance between\nthem like the distance the boy wanted to\nconvey. But my mom didn't mean to blame\nyou. We're just ordinary Freeman. After\nmy father died in battle, it was already\nvery benevolent of you to give us a\npension. At the fat kid's house, the boy\nreturned with his arms full of various\nmedicines. Mom, I'm back. Behind him was\nthe Supreme Lord, Sibbon. The boy's\nmother with a pale sickly face sat up.\nThe little kid tugged at his mother's\nhand, pointing, \"Mom, this is the Lord.\nHe came to visit you. This nutritional\nmedicine, he's the one who bought it for\nyou.\" The mother tremblingly performed a\nsalute. \"My lord,\" this common woman,\nseeing the common woman's weakness,\nSibbon ordered her not to stand on\nceremony. \"This is an order.\" The mother\nthanked Sibbon and laid back down on the\nbed. Sibbon had come not only to see the\nmother and son's situation, but also to\nask about the matter clearly. I heard\nyour pension money was stolen by bad\npeople, and there was a knight helping\nthem from behind. The mother explained,\n\"My lord, can you help us?\" She slowly\nrecounted, \"It was the Boto gang. There\nare a group of vagrants outside the city\nwho normally live by collecting\nprotection fees.\" That day, not long\nafter the master knight came to deliver\nthe pinch of money and left, they showed\nup, stole all the money, and beat me\ninto this state. As she spoke, she\ncouldn't hold back her emotions. Hearing\nthis, Sibbon's blood boiled, and the\nveins in his eyes became prominent. They\nalso said we could come find them for\nrevenge anytime, that behind them were\nthe master knight and the lord. Lord,\nSibbin clenched his fists, wishing he\ncould teach them a lesson immediately.\nInsolent. These dogs not only do evil,\nbut also borrow my name. He gritted his\nteeth, his anger blazing. I like to see\njust who the knight behind these\nvagrants is. Early morning at a tavern\nin Lind Dong. This girl in a black bunny\noutfit was asking a strange customer.\nSir, may I ask what you would like to\ndrink? This cloaked customer turned out\nto be Lord Sibbon. He tossed the girl a\ngold coin, a glass of your best wine.\nThe black bunny girl immediately took\nit, thanking him profusely. You are so\ngenerous, sir. Please wait a moment. If\nyou have any other needs, you can also\ntell me. I am Vina. Sibbon sat by the\ntavern window, pretending to be an\nordinary person, observing quietly. A\nthug on the street suddenly caught his\neye, drawing his attention. He swaggered\naround whistling. Sib thought to\nhimself, \"Finally, here.\" Vina\ncheerfully brought the drink to Sibbon's\ntable. On her guest, here's your wine.\nAt the same time, a sudden gust of\nstrong wind blew, causing Vina to stop\nin her tracks. After she opened her\neyes, her generous customer from before\nhad disappeared. In an instant, the seat\nfrom before was empty without a trace.\nThe thug was beaten black and blue, his\nface bruised and trembling. \"Now I ask,\nyou answer.\" Sibbon pressed his neck\nagainst the wall with one hand,\nsuppressing his fury. \"If you give me a\nnonsense answer, you will die.\" The\nterrified thug obediently complied.\nSibbon's voice was stern. Was it you who\nstole the pension from the Burnree\nfamily? After he admitted it, he\ninterrogated him further. Who's else?\nThe thug didn't dare to lie and confess\none by one. Also, also the Dyke family,\nthe Aen family, and the Barrow family.\nHe stammered. Other than that, that's\nall. Only the families living in the\ntiled roof area. Sib knew well that\nthese people couldn't act so brazenly\nalone. He continued to ask, \"Who ordered\nyou to do this?\" The thug hesitated. It\nmust be a considerable power that made\nhim cautious and afraid to tell the\ntruth. Sibbon tensed his hand, squeezing\nthe thug's throat tightly. Unable to\nbear it any longer, he cried out, \"It's\ngrass. Night grass. He forced us to do\nit. Please, please spare me.\" Sibbin\ncouldn't help but be surprised by the\nname that had just come from the thug's\nmouth. \"Grass? Why would it be him?\" The\nmemory of night grass was still vivid in\nSibbin's mind. The day grass knelt\nbefore the boy he was, vowing on his\nnightly faith to follow young master\nSibbin forever. The afternoon sun cast\nlong shadows over Grass's villa.\nSuddenly, the door to Grass's villa\nburst open with a violent noise. Grass,\nwho is immersed in a moment of pleasure,\njumped up with a start. Who is it? Sib\nswept his gaze over the scene before\nhim. Having quite a bit of fun, aren't\nwe? One man with two women, no less.\nSince I'm here, you must know why,\nright? Grass hadn't realized the Lord\nalready knew all of his crimes. He\nscratched his head and gave sheepish\nlaugh. My apologies, Lord. Sleeping with\ntwo people at once isn't against the\nlaw, is it? Sibbon lunged forward, his\nhand gripping grass's neck tightly, his\neyes blazing with fire, almost roaring,\nstop pretending to be innocent. Did you\ntake the pension money for the fallen\nsoldiers? In a panic, grass gasped for\nbreath. Lord, so you're talking about\nthis? It's just a little pinchion money.\nIs it necessary to be so fierce in your\naccusation? Sib tightened his grip.\nSparks of mana flashing. He questioned,\n\"Not necessary? This is a capital crime\nand you still feel it's not necessary?\"\nFaced with the accusation, grass roared\nin discontent. \"A great knight like me\ngets a monthly salary of three gold\ncoins while those dead people get a 10\ngold coin pension after they die. On\nwhat grounds?\" He roared in resentment.\nAre their lives worth that much money?\nTheir families, those low lives, even\nget an extra five silver coins from the\nfinance department every month. Those\nlow lives clearly do nothing at all.\nGrass still refused to back down,\npointing a hand at the two women on his\nbed. My lord, look, with 10 gold coins,\nI can live much more comfortably. Gas\nlooked at Sib, trying to appeal to his\ncompassion. My lord, are you really\ngoing to kill a knight who has followed\nyou for many years for the sake of some\ninsignificant commoners? His tone was\nfull of urgency mixed with a hint of\ncunning. I'm a great knight. Sibbon had\nno more patience to listen to Gas's\nabsurd excuses. He glared, inciting\nruffians, violating military orders, and\nyou call yourself a great knight. Gas\nhad clearly reached the limit of\nSibbin's loyalty and patience. Don't you\nadmire those fallen soldiers? He\nclenched his fists. Very well. From now\non, your family can also receive such a\npension when the palace bell strikes 13.\nEveryone in the castle stopped to\nlisten. This was the bell the lord used\nto summon the thief's people for a\npublic execution. They wondered who the\nunlucky person was. This time, Sibbon\nstroed between the rows of guards, his\neyes fixed ahead on the place where\nGas's judgment was about to take place.\nGas was tightly bound, a soldier\nescorting him behind Sibbon. Everyone,\nSibbon began, I have summoned you all\nhere today to announce a few things and\na chop off ahead. Sibbon looked down\ncoldly, pronouncing the sentence. It is\nthe great night gas who serves under me.\nThe crowd gasped, buzzing at the\nshocking news. God's above. It's hard to\nbelieve the person the Lord is about to\nbehead is the old knight. Some couldn't\nbelieve their ears. How is that\npossible? Could it be that he slept with\nthe Lord's wife? A royal guard hearing\nthe growing whispers raised his voice to\ncalm the crowd. Silence. Sib didn't mind\nstating the reason. He said bluntly, \"If\nyou all want to know why, I will make it\nclear. First, defying military orders\nand stealing the pensions of fallen\nsoldiers. Second, as a knight, he used\nhis strength to bully the weak.\" The\ncrowd now fixed their gazes on gas who\nwas kneeling on a wooden block, his neck\nin an iron yolk. The death sentence\nwasn't over. Third, inciting ruffians\nand disturbing the peace. Therefore,\neven if he is a great knight, the death\npenalty must be carried out. Sib stood\nnext to the criminal, clearing his\nthroat to address all the citizens.\nHaving you all here today to witness the\nexecution is to let everyone know that\nhere in Eagle Crest, the dignity of a\nsoldier is inviable. The honor of a\nsoldier is not to be insulted. Sibbon's\ngaze fell upon gas. Whether they are\nmilitia men, guards, or knights,\nsoldiers, there is no distinction\nbetween high and low. As people who\nreceive the people's support, they must\nnot let the people go hungry and cold.\nAnd in the moment before his life was to\nend, gas suddenly burst into\ncontemptuous laughter. Haha, you'll\nregret today's decision. You will\ndefinitely regret it. Sib gave the\norder. Execute him. The palace bell\nstruck once and Gas's head was severed\nfrom his neck in an instant. Host has\nexecuted the great knight Gas who\nfollowed him for many years, receiving\n2,000 villain points. Host, please\ncontinue to work hard and soon become\nthe strongest villain. Sib received the\nnotification from the system, stunned.\nWhat a guard, seeing him about to\ncollapse, asked, \"My lord, are you all\nright?\" Sib feeling helpless asked the\nsystem again. I eliminated a harm to the\npeople and still got villain points.\nWhat kind of morality does your system\nhave? Can you tell me? The system\nexplained, showing an image of the\nfrightened populace because the ignorant\ncommoners are only terrified of your\nimage. Then came an image of the guards\nand the knights under you because of\nthat ruthlessness feel. Terrified.\nSibbin was momentarily speechless at the\nscenes he had just witnessed. Sib\ncouldn't believe his move had gone so\nwrong. He turned to a knight. You there?\nTell me your thoughts on this matter. I\nneed your most honest opinion. Seeing\nhim hesitate, Sibon added, \"This is an\norder.\" The knight, sweating profusely\nas he spoke, said, \"Because the great\nknight had followed you for so many\nyears and was absolutely loyal. Yet you\nexecuted Gas for a few dead people, a\nfew ordinary commoners.\" Sibon cut him\noff. Absolutely loyal. But do others\nthink like you? The guard's face fell.\nYes, that's right. The vast majority do.\nSome others seem indifferent. Even Even\nLord Grimman said his crime was not\nworthy of death. Sibbon sat in his\noffice in the palace, propping his head\nin his hands and sighing. He recalled\nGas's last words. \"You will definitely\nregret it. Kill me and everyone will\nonly see that you've killed your most\nloyal subordinate who will trust you,\nwho won't want to follow you anymore.\"\nHis train of thought was interrupted by\na knock on the door. \"Master, may I come\nin?\" Recognizing Lor's voice, Sibbon\nsaid softly, \"Come in.\" Lorie opened the\ndoor a crack holding milk and cake.\nMaster, will you be having dinner\ntonight? Seeing the Lord looking\npensive, Lorie asked, \"Is something\ntroubling you?\" Sib hesitated for a\nmoment. \"It's nothing. I'm just not\nsleeping well.\" Lorie refused to believe\nhim. \"Master, if you have something on\nyour mind, don't hide it from Lorie.\nPerhaps I can help you.\" Sib finally\nsighed, his voice low. \"All right, it's\nactually about the pension matter.\" His\nvoice dropped, mixed with fatigue and a\nhaunting quality. I don't think I was\nwrong. The fallen need to be remembered,\nand a person like Gas could not be kept.\nLorie shook her head, saying firmly,\n\"How could master be wrong?\" She\nreassured him that her father once said,\n\"No one is a born hero.\" Although a\nfallen soldier is just the most ordinary\nperson, the crown must bear its weight.\nThe moment they put on armor and take up\na sword to go to battle, each of them is\na hero. Lorie continued to reason. If\neven a hero's back is not protected, but\ninstead is trampled upon at will, then\nwho in this world would want to be a\nhero anymore? Those innocent words of\nencouragement made Sibbon feel somewhat\nrelieved. He caressed the little girl's\ncheek. \"You're so right, Lorie.\" Sibbon\ngently leaned down and placed a light\nkiss on the little girl's cheek. \"Lori,\nhaving you is my greatest luck.\" Lor's\ncheeks flushed red, and she asked\ninnocently, \"Master, so can I have a\nbaby for you now?\" Sibbon tried to\nsuppress his awkward expression. That's\nnot possible. Wait until you're a little\nolder, then we'll talk. Be good. Lori\nwas stubborn. But I'm already an adult.\nSib was stern. Novats. Tomorrow. I have\nto take you to perceive the power of the\nsubhuman bloodline. We'll talk about the\nbaby after you fully awakened. Sibbon\nhad a hard time convincing the maid who\nwas always asking to have his child and\ncould only find a temporary excuse to\nget by. He acted cold on the outside,\nbut after Lorie left, Sibbon could only\nbury his face in his pillow and cry his\neyes out. It's all the fault of this\ndamn system for constantly emphasizing\nand reminding me of Lorie's weak body\nwhen the atmosphere was so good. He\nconsoled himself by seeing what useful\nthings he could exchange for with the\n2,000 villain points he just got. A new\ndaily necessities section had appeared\nin the system, full of things like\ncrossbow carts, magic stones, scented\nsoap, and perfume. These things could be\ntaken to the royal capital to make a\nprofit. Siban lay there scrolling\nthrough these interesting items. Ice\nsilk lace underwear. A set was only 50\npoints. Explosives, but they were too\nexpensive. Siege weapons, 600 points. As\nhe scrolled to the siege ladder, an idea\nflashed in Sibbon's mind. He immediately\nsat up and summoned a council of\nministers. At the meeting table, Sibbon\nannounced loudly. Everyone must know\nthat this time we're going to war with\nBuddhaf to seize the iron ore and obtain\nmore resources. The soldiers listened\nintently. But now I have changed my\nmind. His eyes shone brightly at the\nidea he was about to voice. We will not\nonly seize the iron ore, but we must\nalso take the opportunity to sack their\nmain city, Homeman. The generals felt\nthis was impossible, and dissenting\nopinions arose. This idea is too absurd.\nIn the end, he's just a kid with no war\nexperience. It's ridiculous to think I\nactually came here to listen to his\nbattle plan. As the soldiers were about\nto stand up, Grim spoke up. Please,\nplease wait a moment. He turned to\nSibbon. Young master, I'm afraid the\nplan to attack Buddhan City is very\ndifficult to achieve. First, we don't\nhave siege weapons and it's too late to\nbuild them now. And even if we had siege\nweapons, we couldn't transport them in a\nBuduan thief. Most importantly, Budoo\nand City has magic cannons installed,\nwhich are not easy for even a great\nknight to deal with. Listening to the\nexplanation, Sibbon's expression was as\nif he had already thought it through\ncarefully. Leave the problem of siege\nweapons to me. The room erupted in\nastonishment after Sibbin's declaration.\nYoung master, you can solve it. Even\nthough he was the lord, no one had ever\nthought Sibbon could handle such a great\nresponsibility. With cunning strategy\nand careful calculation, Sibbon said he\nhad thought of a way to get two giant\nsiege engines into Buduan city without\nanyone knowing. Next, I need the\nopinions of you ministers. If I can pin\ndown the main forces of the Buddhan\nfamily and also have two siege engines,\nhow much military strength will be\nneeded to launch a Blitz attack and\ndefeat Budin City? Grimman advised young\nmaster Budoo and City is a major city\nafter all. Even with siege engines and\npinning down the enemy's main force, it\nwould still be difficult to capture.\nBesides, Sibbon grew impatient. Besides\nwhat? Don't hesitate. Just say what's on\nyour mind. What worry Grim was related\nto what had just happened. Great night\ngas, the one Sibbin just executed, was\nthe person in charge of recruitment for\nthe army. Therefore, the number of\nrecruits this time is not ideal. Grim\nsighed. We no longer have the ability to\nrecruit more troops to control a major\ncity. Sibbon smirked smugly. What if we\ndon't need to control Buddhan city? The\nministers, hearing one absurdity after\nanother, could no longer remain calm.\nThey slammed the table. No need. Then\nhow do we attack the city? Sib said\nsoftly, \"Rest assured, I'm not crazy. We\nonly need to control the city walls and\nsweep up all the money in Home City.\"\nGrimman saw a glimmer of light in Sib's\nplan. He advised if so only 500 militia\nmen and 10 great knights would be needed\nto do it. He calculated further at that\ntime to protect the iron ore the Buduan\nfamily will certainly have to commit all\ntheir forces leaving the guarding force\nin the city extremely limited.\nTherefore, the siege only needs to rely\non the siege weapons to capture the city\nwalls and control the magic cannons.\nCovering the great knights and\ntransporting the wealth will be enough.\nThen he asked Sibbon doubtfully, \"It's\njust that young master, can you really\nget complete siege weapons into Buddhu\nand thief?\" Sibbon crossed his arms.\n\"What? Even you don't believe me?\"\nGrimman placed his right hand on his\nleft chest respectfully. I, Grimman, of\ncourse, will forever trust you. Sibbon\nsaid with satisfaction, \"Very good. If\nthat's the case, then everyone should\nhave no more doubts.\" Next, Sibbon will\nannounce the battle plan. Sib began to\nassign tasks clearly. Grimman and the\nBloodhood side will lead the main army\nand set out tomorrow at noon. No need to\nhide. Release the news so the Buddhan\nfamily knows we are coming. Remember to\nstand parallel. Do not attack. The rest\nof the bloodood clan will go with Sibbin\nleading 500 militia men and begin a\nforced march to Budan thief tomorrow\nafternoon. Sibbin pointed out each move\non the map. According to the plan, we\nwill arrive at Buduin late at night.\nAfter arriving, we will immediately\nbegin the siege. We must take the city\nwalls within 10 minutes, evacuate\nHomeman within an hour, and then\nimmediately return to support the main\narmy. Are there any other questions?\nCaptain Goodbye, who had been listening\nintently, suddenly raised his hand. My\nlord, I have a question. The captain's\nface was full of fighting spirit as his\nwish to go into battle was about to be\nfulfilled. If we are confident of\ndefeating the Buddhan family in a\nfrontal assault, why not defeat them\nfirst before attacking Buddhan city? The\ncrowd fell silent at the Divine Light\nTown's Army captain's idea. Amidst the\ncrowd's snickering, Grimman irritably\nshouted, \"Are you an idiot? Are you\ncompletely certain you can trap all of\nthe Buddhan family's men? Young Master\nSibbon can produce siege weapons. So,\nthis operation is the best opportunity.\nIf we attack them head-on and the\nBudooan family can't win and retreats to\nBuduan City, relying on their dozen or\nso magic mages, what will Eagle Crest\nuse to fight back? Just throw our lives\naway? Captain Goodbye suddenly realized\nhow shallow his thinking was. Indeed,\nonly Grimman thoroughly understood\nSibbon's moves. Sibbon didn't elaborate\nfurther and concluded, \"Well, if no one\nhas any other opinions, we will proceed\naccording to the plan tomorrow. For now,\nyou may all go back and prepare.\"\nMeeting dismissed. In the territory on\nthe other side of the border, Budwin had\nprepared men along the frontier as\ninstructed by his leader. A guard ran up\nto report. My lord, a situation has\ndeveloped in the Eagler Crest territory.\nThe Buddh and general was extremely\nsurprised upon hearing this. You said\nyou saw Grim. Then were the other\nsoldiers and the Lord of Eagle Crest?\nThe guard stammered. Yes, my lord. Your\nsubordinate only saw Great Knight Grim\nalone. He tried hard to recall. There\nwas also a monster. It looked very much\nlike a beastman's minur, but its\nphysique was much larger. It must have\nbeen 3 m tall. And our men discovered\ndiscovered that their army had started\nto set up camp and cook showing no\nintention of starting a battle. Even\nGeneral Budin was left spinning after\nhearing this. He wondered what on earth\nis this count of eagle crest playing at.\nThey clearly came to seize the iron ore\nwere arrogant when declaring war. And\nnow that the war has started, they're\njust camped 2 km away motionless. To get\na grasp of the situation, General Budin\nordered, \"Continue scouting. Get a\nlittle closer. If you really can't, then\nuse the lives of peasants to make up for\nit. The subordinate had just left to\nobey the order when another one\nreturned. Back so soon? Did you overhear\nany important news? The general asked\nimpatiently. The scout dressed in all\nblack, completely covered, and looking\nextremely mysterious, looked at the\ngreat general with a serious expression.\nViscount Budin couldn't help but ask\nsuspiciously, \"Who are you?\" But this\ncloaked figure just smirked. Then he\ndirectly handed him a letter and said\ncryptically, \"I am someone who has come\nto help you.\" The news you want is all\nhere, especially the whereabouts of the\nLord of Eagle Crest, which you're most\ninterested in. Faced with this seemingly\nheaven-sent piece of helpful news, he\ncouldn't help but be suspicious and\nwary, wanting to reach out for it while\nalso being on guard against the man's\nintentions. Why should I trust you? And\nwhy are you helping me? Hearing this,\nthe man could no longer hide his\nintentions. He raised a finger and\ndirectly stated his demand. I have a\ncondition. If you win, I want half the\nprofits from the iron ore. Viscount\nBudoan holding the letter furiously\nshouted, \"Half? Are you insane? What\nmakes you think I would agree to you?\"\nThe man didn't say much more and\ndirectly pulled down his hood. Then he\nsmiled nonchalantly, full of confidence\nthat Viscount Budin would have to obey\nand replied smugly on the fact that\nwithout my information, you will\ndefinitely lose this battle. At this\nmoment, over by Budin's city wall, which\nwas sturdy, solid, and towered to the\nsky, Sibbon, standing below, had to look\nup to get a good view. To be honest,\nthis solid city wall made him exclaim in\nadmiration as he looked at it. This\nBuddhoo and family must have been really\nrich before. This iron gold stone wall\nwould be impossible to breach without\nsiege weapons. Even for a sky knight\nlike me, it would take a very long time.\nThen, not wanting to waste any more\ntime, he called the system. I want to\nexchange for two siege engines. In a\nflash, the system reported back. Ding.\nExchange for two siege engines. Do you\nwant to spawn them? He replied\ndecisively, spawn them now. Immediately\nafter, two top grade siege engines were\nspawned by the system before everyone's\neyes. When the siege weapons appeared,\nthe two Minotaur brothers were wideeyed\nwith astonishment, confusion, and\nbewilderment. Unable to let any more\ntime go to waste, Sibbon shot forward\nwith his power. Then he carefully\nassigned the tasks again. You guys take\nthe siege weapons and the militia to\nattack from the other side. I will\nattack from this side and wait for you\nto regroup. Yes, my lord. Meanwhile, two\ncity guards were still in their\nrespective corners, one standing and one\nsitting, sleeping soundly, completely\nunaware of what was about to happen to\nBuddhan City. As Sibbin flew past, using\nhis power, the two began to sense a\nstrange aura and groggy woke up, letting\nout a soft cry. Ugg. But before these\ntwo could fully wake up, he used his\npower to put them into an eternal\nendless sleep. Just then, another guard\nsaw this from a distance and was stunned\nin amazement. This man hurriedly shouted\nto alert his comrades for support. Enemy\nattack. Someone is attacking the city.\nSo, very quickly, a series of other\nsoldiers rushed out to swarm him. There\nwas even one sitting in wait preparing\nto fire a cannon straight at him, just\nwaiting for the right moment. However,\njust as his hand lightly touched the\ncontrol lever, an unseen shadow appeared\nbehind him, making him feel a\nsignificant threat as cold sweat poured\ndown in streams. It was an extremely\nsuffocating feeling. The minur didn't\nsay much and directly flung him down\nfrom the control machine, causing him to\nscream loudly in pain, \"Ug!\" before\nfalling with a thud to the ground. The\nenemy was gone, so this playground was\nnow for CS. He looked at the control\nlever with fascination and enchantment.\nNext, without much thought, he directly\nfired this advanced weapon, shooting a\nblast straight to the opposite side. A\nterrifyingly powerful and oppressive\nblast was unleashed. It shot straight\nfrom Cax's position to the building\nopposite and exploded with a boom,\ncreating a powerful spreading fire. The\nMinotaur's eyes lit up with fascination\nas he exclaimed, \"By Mother Earth above,\nCax likes this.\" So he had to hurry over\nand remind him, \"All right, stop\nplaying. Leave a few men to guard one\nside of the city wall. Destroy all the\nother magic cannons in the city for me.\nThe rest of you follow me to loot home\nand castle clean.\" This made him jump in\nalarm like a child being scolded for\ndoing something wrong. Suddenly, the\nsystems notification sound rang out.\nDing. Daily villain quest updated.\nVillain quest one. Plunder the iron ore\nthat originally belonged to the Buddhan\nfamily. Villain quest two, loot home and\ncastle clean. Villain quest three, in\nthe upcoming battle, kill all the earth\nknights and send the heads of the earth\nknights to count. This immediate mission\nleft him a bit stunned and bewildered\nbecause of its reward as well.\nCompleting all missions has a chance to\ntrigger a critical reward. Host, please\ncontinue to work hard. Great night\nGrimman felt that the situation didn't\nseem right and said, \"Strange.\" This\nmade Sib ask with some curiosity,\n\"What's wrong?\" Right after he directly\nvoiced the doubts in his heart.\nLogically speaking, Viscount Budan is\nnaturally suspicious. Once he suspected\nthe Eagle Crest army was delaying, he\nwould have launched an attack\nimmediately. So much time has passed\nnow. Why is there no movement? Then\nsuddenly a panicked soldier came running\nand shouting loudly, \"Lord Grim and I,\nit's bad.\" This made him a little\nworried and he hurly asked, \"What is\nit?\" The soldier, out of breath, hastily\nreported what he had observed. I went to\nthe enemy's position to investigate and\nfound their camp empty. He was so\nshocked he couldn't believe it and\nhurriedly asked, \"What did you say?\" The\nyoung man then affirmed with even more\ncertainty and determination. I saw with\nmy own eyes that there wasn't a single\nsoldier in the enemy's camp. Judging by\nthe tracks on the ground, it seems they\nhave retreated. Understanding the\nenemy's plan, his gut burned with\nanxiety as he exclaimed in horror to\nhimself, \"This is bad.\" Then he\nimpatiently shouted, \"Young Master\nSibbon.\" Next, he hastily ordered a\nchange to the previously established\nplan. All soldiers advance to home and\ncastle at top speed. Meanwhile, Sibbon\nand Home and Castle was still unaware of\nthe terrible things that were about to\nhappen to him. So, he was still\ncheerfully ordering his subordinates,\n\"Take everything that's valuable.\nAnything inconvenient to take, like oil\npaintings and silks, burn it all.\" His\ncold and brutal voice made the few\ncommoners present tremble like leaves.\nSeeing CS even gathering some plates, he\nshouted an annoyance. What are you\ntaking plates for? They're not worth a\npenny. Smash them. The system somehow\nescaped its low-level robbing interest\nand started down the path of becoming a\ncrazed bandit. Crazed CS. As if he had\njust discovered something interesting,\ncalled out to him in an excited voice,\n\"My lord, hurry and come see what's\nhere.\" This made him reply with some\nsuspicion. What is it? As he approached\nthe door that the two minotaurs had\nopened, the glittering light of gold,\nsilver, treasures, and jewelry flashed\nout. His eyes immediately lit up. The\ncorners of his mouth curved up quite a\nbit, and his mood brightened\nconsiderably as he exclaimed, \"So much\ngold.\" Turns out this viscount budin is\nquite something. His heart bloomed with\njoy as he thought to himself, \"I've\nstruck it rich.\" Next, he cheerfully and\nexcitedly ordered, \"You and the other\nminotaurs, come here. Move all of these\nchests out.\" They quickly ran over and\nhastily replied, \"Coming right away, my\nlord.\" Then suddenly, an iron cage\nabruptly dropped down, imprisoning them.\nSibon also shouted a loud warning to\neveryone. It's a trap. The minur quickly\nreassured him, \"No need to worry, my\nlord. Watch me. It's just a flimsy\ncage.\" Then he used all his strength to\nbend the sturdy iron cage. But no matter\nhow much he bent it, no matter how much\nstrength he used, the iron cage was not\ndamaged or moved in the slightest,\nmaking the minur a little suspicious.\nHuh, strange. Why isn't it budging at\nall? Therefore, the minur shouted and\nturned to warn, \"My lord, there's\nsomething strange about this cage.\"\nSeeing the situation, he also pondered\nto himself, \"If even the minur's\nstrength is not enough, then even for\nme, I'm afraid it's also.\" Then a smug\nvoice suddenly rang out. It's useless.\nHe glanced at him with some suspicion\nand asked, \"You are Viscount Budoan.\"\nHearing this, the man laughed sinisterly\nand said, \"Long time no see, Lord of\nEagle Crest.\" Faced with Viscount\nBudin's sudden appearance, he couldn't\nhelp but speculate suspiciously. He's\nappearing here. Could it be that Grimman\nand the others lost? This gave the man\nanother opportunity to laugh mockingly.\nHaha, those fools are still waiting for\nme to launch an attack. By the time they\nreact, they might just be in time to\ncollect your corpses. He gripped the\ncold iron bar, his voice becoming\ngrimmer than ever. As he asked flatly,\n\"There is one thing I'm very curious\nabout. How did you know I was at home in\ncastle? It couldn't have been a\ncoincidence that someone told you. Could\nit?\" He then looked at him with a cold\ngaze that seemed to see through one's\nsoul full of sarcasm. Seeing that he had\nguessed the situation, the man was not\nangry, but laughed out loud. Haha,\nworthy of the lord of Eagle Crest. You\ngrasp the key point in an instant. It's\na pity you're still too young, unable to\nsee through people's hearts. As he\nspoke, he clapped his hands, endlessly\npraising his ability. Next, he coldly\nwalked to the iron cage and faintly\nadvised him, \"From now on, remember not\nto trust anyone so easily, and\nespecially don't get involved with\npeople you shouldn't.\" And he pressed\nthat cold sword against his neck\nthreateningly. His face was full of\nmalice, and a strong killing intent\nemanated from him. He thrust the sword\ntowards him and said with a heart full\nof satisfaction, \"Time to die, Lord of\nEagle Crest.\" At the very moment he was\nabout to finish him off, a familiar aura\nsuddenly appeared. The sword he was\nusing for the deed was knocked flying\nbackward, and his face couldn't help but\nshow alarm and astonishment. As for him,\nhe was both overjoyed and worried as he\nshouted loudly. \"Grim!\" at this moment,\nhe had used his fastest speed to stop\nhim. His face was full of worry mixed\nwith guilt as he spoke, \"Master, I\napologize for being late.\" This Count\nBuddhan stood to one side, laughing\nloudly and exclaiming, \"Worthy of a\ngreat night. To have broken through the\nencirclement so quickly. Oh ho ho, it's\na pity you only have one great knight\nwho caught up while we have three great\nknights.\" After speaking, his face was\nnow full of smug arrogance. Grimman,\nrefusing to back down, threaten back.\nYou'd better release our lord of Eagle\nCrest or our reinforcements will\nimmediately level this place. But how\ncould these words deceive an old fox\nlike this, Count Budin?\nI heard that the lord of Eagle Crest\nkilled the great knight in charge of\nconscription as a show of force before\ndispatching his troops. So, I guess you\ndon't have any reinforcements ready.\nNext, he ordered his subordinates,\n\"Capture him for me.\" So they didn't\ndare hesitate and replied, \"As you\ncommand.\" Then they rushed forward and\nattacked Grimman in unison. A frenzied\nkilling intent erupted from all of them,\nbut he remained unfased, gripping his\nsword tightly. But as he was dueling\nwith one of them, another attacked from\nbehind. The chaotic scene before his\neyes made Sibbon, though trapped, so\nworried that he had to shout a warning\nto him, \"Watch your back.\" At this\nmoment, he could only curse helplessly,\n\"Damn it. Trapped in this wretched cage,\nI can't do anything. After being ganged\nup on for a while, Grimman finally could\nno longer hold out. He had gradually\nlost all his strength and fell flat. On\nthe ground, sharp blades were also\npressed against his neck, ready to take\nhis life at any moment. Just when he\nthought he was about to lose his life,\nViscount Budin suddenly made an offer.\nI'll give you a chance to survive now.\nThe prerequisite is that you must be\nloyal to Count. A powerhouse like you\nshouldn't die. so resentfully here.\nHowever, for a true powerhouse like him,\nthis was nothing short of a humiliation.\nSo he resolutely replied, \"I, Grimman,\nswear to die loyal to the Lord of Eagle\nCrest.\" Seeing him so resolute, he knew\nthat any further attempts would be\nfeudal. So he replied with some regret.\n\"What a pity! Kill him!\" At the same\ntime, outside Buddhan City, the scene\nwas more chaotic than ever, with\nsoldiers from both sides clashing to\ndetermine a victor. Everyone's face\nferocious and filled with a killing\nintent to take the opponent's life. At\nthis time, Sibbon's soldiers began to\npanic slightly. They started to fall\ninto confusion and hesitation. The\nnumber of enemy troops was too large. If\nwe continue to be worn down like this,\nsooner or later, our entire army will be\ndefeated. But what about the Lord?\nHowever, there was still someone who\nconfidently reassured his comrades.\nGrimman has broken out of the\nencirclement. He will definitely bring\nthe Lord back. safely. We should retreat\nfirst and discuss things more\nthoroughly. When there were still some\nwho hesitated, saying, \"But,\" he once\nagain replied decisively, \"There are no\nbuts. If we don't retreat now, there\nwon't be any time left.\" After that,\nthey hid in a safe corner to conceal\nthemselves. But even from a distance,\nthey could see a group of people holding\nall sorts of crude weapons like hoes,\nshovels, hammers, and sickles, charging\nforward with great enthusiasm and\nshouting, \"Kill.\" Only now did they\njoyfully say that reinforcements had\narrived. An old farmer even strongly\nsuggested, \"Sir Knights, you should go.\nWe are just a group of farmers. But you,\nSir Knights, are the important strength\nof our lord,\" which made them a bit\nbewildered and ask, \"You are all a\nself-organized militia.\" But why?\nHearing this, the farmers, they're also\nemotionally shared. The Lord has been\ncompassionate to us, reducing our taxes.\nWe have nothing to repay him with. We're\nwilling to trade these humble lives of\nours for the survival of usernites. User\nknights will surely protect Eagle Crest\nCity well and protect the lord. Now deep\ninside home and castle, Grimman could no\nlonger resist. He was lying listlessly\non the ground, looking at the cold,\nsharp sword pointing straight at him. A\nsoldier had begun to execute his\ntechnique, gripping the sword in his\nhand and saying coldly, \"Go die.\" when\nsuddenly another sword flew in from\nnowhere. And the one who threw it was\nnone other than Sibbon. But this guy,\nstill unaware, just ducked his head and\nran for his life. Then the iron cage\nsuddenly exploded. This guy was still\nconfused, scratching his head and\nmuttering to himself, \"Damn it, the\nsword you threw is off target.\" But he\njust coldly approached him and asked in\na low voice, \"Offt target? Why don't I\nfeel that way?\" This sent a chill down\nhis spine and cold sweat broke out.\nMeanwhile, he looked at him coldly, his\nwhole body radiating a furious aura. The\nsoldiers, seeing Sibbon, who was\nsupposed to be trapped, now looming\nbefore them, couldn't help but be\nastonished and wonder in disbelief. How\nis this possible? This Count Budin was\nsimilarly suspicious and voices doubt,\n\"How did that guy get out?\" Then he\ntried to recall and realized with horror\nthat it was the chaotic sword light from\njust now, a spell to break the cage from\nthe outside. But he couldn't believe it\nand exclaimed, \"So absurd in such a\nchaotic situation.\" And yet, however, no\nmatter how astonished he was, he still\ntried to act fine. But deep down, he was\nin turmoil as he reassured the soldiers.\n\"Don't be afraid. Our side has three\ngreat knights. The advantage hasn't\nchanged. Let's go together and stop\nhim.\" Seeing their commander so\nconfident, the soldiers quickly replied,\nunderstood, and heroically charged\nforward. Facing the large number of\nenemy troops, Grimman couldn't help but\nworry and rushed forward to remind\nSibbin, \"Young Mash, be careful these\nguys.\" But as soon as he uttered the\nword young, his words got stuck in his\nthroat, his face filled with astonished\nhorror. Looking at the flame of power\nburning around Sibbon, while he himself\nwas confidently shining like a\nglittering torch, he couldn't help but\nwonder in confusion, a pale golden\nbattle aura. What kind of power is this?\nHowever, it seemed the soldiers were not\nyet aware of what was about to happen to\nthem. So, they began to execute their\ntechnique, sky. And yet, just as they\nshouted their slogan, sky knight, they\nwere immediately incinerated by his\nbattle flame in bewildered horror. After\ndealing with these minions, he suddenly\nlet out a sigh of relief. While the\nviscount began to tremble in fear and\nscreamed, \"Oh, wa!\" Heidied his soar\nbehind his back, then turned to ask,\n\"Grim, are you all right?\" Only now did\nthe others frantically report, \"My lord,\nhe's too heavily injured and has passed\nout, causing him to shout in worried\nsurprise.\" \"What?\" Sib quickly went over\nto briefly check his condition, then\nbreathed a sigh of relief. Luckily, it's\nnot life-threatening. After returning\nand drinking a potion of life, he'll be\na fine man. Again, as the lord of Eagle\nCrest, he also had a ponder, but\nsituations like this will become more\nand more frequent in the future. The\nnumber of injured will also increase. We\ncan't drink a potion of life every time.\nThis time, after returning, I must make\nsure to grasp the timing for Lor's\nawakening. The bullheaded men began to\ndisplay their might, directly, using\ntheir weapons to execute their\nabilities, strength, and loyalty,\ncausing the surrounding people to only\nscream and wail, \"Wawa!\" which made\nthose around them whisper amongst\nthemselves, \"Those those monsters\nactually have magic cannons.\" But after\ncareful observation, they suddenly\nrealized, looking closely, \"Aren't those\nthe cannons from our own city walls?\"\nThe bloodood clan has joined the\nbattlefield. Quick, report to the\nViscount. The people on Budoo and City's\nside were thrown into a panic. Then they\nbegan to shout an alarm. Budan City\nBudin City has fallen. Home and Castle\nhas also been completely wiped out. The\nViscount is missing. This caused the\nentire crowd to fall into chaos. What?\nAnd then they urged each other,\n\"Retreat. retreat. Everything proceeded\nlike this until night fell. Grimman\nasked with some curiosity, \"Young Master\nSibbon, you've broken through to become\na sky knight.\" To which he nonchalantly\nreplied, \"I just broke through 2 days\nago. I just didn't have time to tell\nyou.\" The steward was now moved, feeling\njoyful as he exclaimed, \"That's great.\nThat's wonderful.\" Young Master Sib, I\napologize for my previous doubts about\nwhat you were doing. If not for the\nself-organized militia's aid this time\nwhich turned the situation around this\nold life of mine would probably have\nbeen left here and you were so young in\nthe future you can definitely become a\nchampion knight and even becoming a\nlegend is not impossible. This made him\nsmile happily and chuckle in response.\nPerhaps one day under my leadership the\nflag of Eagle Crest territory might fly\nall over the king continent. Who knows?\nThe bullheaded man also enthusiastically\nmade promises and vows. My lord, the\nbloodwood clan is willing to go through\nthorns for you to serve you with utmost\ndevotion, causing him to be so moved he\nspat out the water he was drinking.\nThese guys also kept repeating the\nphrase strength and loyalty which\nannoyed him greatly as he complained\nwith disdain. So noisy. A peaceful and\nhappy atmosphere continued like this\nuntil the next morning when he began to\ncall out system draw reward. It\nimmediately appeared and announced\ndetected that the host has completed all\ndaily missions. Drawing rewards for the\nhost. Congratulations to the host for\nreceiving the troop reward. Three-headed\nhellhound. Critical reward triggered.\nSpecial troop upgrade. Sar the hellfire\nlord. The reward will be delivered in a\nreasonable manner. Host, please prepare\nan empty plot of land. detected that the\nhost has completely plundered Budoan\ncity and destroyed the accumulated\nassets of the Buduan family, seized the\niron ore, killed the capable great\nknights under Countam, creating an\nextremely severe psychological impact on\nmany people. Received 30,000 villain\npoints. This generous reward made him\nunable to help but exclaim in happy\nsatisfaction, \"Nice, a critical reward,\nand on top of that, villain points. That\nmuch, huh?\" The system suddenly chimed\nwith a notification. In the sky above\nEagle Crest City, whooshing and swishing\nsounds suddenly appeared, causing the\nsoldiers standing below to look up and\nwatch. And the people in the city were\nno exception. They all had to stop and\nlook up at the blue light that was\nstreaking down along with the\nannouncement, \"The reward has been\ndistributed.\" Meanwhile, Sib was busy\nguessing what the reward was. Humming a\ntune. Hellfire. I wonder what kind of\nunit it is. Probably a fire spirit. I\nwonder where it will appear from this\ntime. Then suddenly the wall behind him\nexploded with a loud bang, shattering\ncompletely, making his little heart feel\nlike it was about to jump out of his\nchest. He cursed angrily as the\nmeteorite suddenly flashed with a ray of\nlight and then cracked wide open. His\nmission reward had appeared. It was so\nlarge it astonished him while it roared\nwith delight. Fire, death, ashes, new\nworld, new destruction, the burning\nlegion burn it all. Great Lord Akmas\nSibbin Sariss the Hellfire will pledge\nmy loyalty to you. But suddenly the\nwords caught in its throat. It exclaimed\nin astonishment a it even had the\naudacity to ask why are you such a tiny\nworm. This infuriated Sibbon who gritted\nhis teeth and said as you can see I'm\nthe one who summoned you and also the\nworm you speak of. This made Sarris\ntremble and hastily correct itself. Ah\ndamn it. Oh no. I mean this is\nwonderful. Sarris, the hellfire will\npledge my loyalty to you, but its\ninsulent mouth was still up to its old\ntricks. You lowly worm. Ah, great lord.\nSib could only reply helplessly, Sarris.\nRight. Can you retract the flames on\nyour body? My desk is about to catch\nfire. Seeing him say this, it obediently\nreplied, \"Of course I can. I'll do it\nfor you right away.\" Sariss ashen form\nIdentity Hellfire Leader Strength Great\nDemon Level 55. 51 to 60.

Look at these amazing\nskills. There's no way I could fight it.\nAs expected, the systems critical hit\nrewards have never been disappointing.\nAfter destroying his desk, it even asked\nsmuggly, \"How about it, worm? A esteemed\ngreat lord.\" Sib pondered for a moment,\nthinking, however, in terms of strength,\nthe fact that it kept calling him a worm\nwas getting on his nerves, so he\nquestioned it. Ultimately, is it\ncontempt or respect? Can you just stick\nto one? But it was still up to its old\ntricks. Yes, Worm. This drove Sibbon mad\nand he quickly reminded it, \"Stick to\nrespect right now.\" He had a headache\nand rubbed his temples, saying in\nfrustration, \"I really want to throw\nthis guy in a class with Lorie. Speak of\nthe devil and he shall appear.\" Lorie\nsuddenly pushed the door open and rushed\nin, asking worriedly, \"Master, are you\nall right?\" Sibbon was truly helpless\nand replied wearily, \"I didn't mean\nright now.\" Seeing the little girl\narrive, Sariss ran over in surprise and\nexclaimed, \"Huh?\" It then looked at the\nlittle girl judgmentally. This hellfire\neven gave its frank assessment. A worm.\nAn even smaller worm. And it looks a bit\nlike a beast man. What a strange worm.\nThis left the little girl wideeyed and\nstunned, fearing she would be hurt. Sib\nhad to quickly speak up and reminded,\n\"Shut your mouth.\" Then he explained in\nconfusion. Lori this is. But before he\ncould finish his sentence, she rushed\ninto his arms and screamed in fear. Man\nmonster, if you're going to eat someone,\neat me. Master, run away quickly. So he\ndidn't know what to do and just stood\nthere frozen, calling out softly,\n\"Lori,\" before he could feel touched,\nthe little girl said again, \"My, my\nmaster stinks. It doesn't taste good.\"\nThis made him want to cry out loud. They\nhad almost completely forgotten the\nmeaning of the word respect. He then\nreassured the little girl, \"Lori, Lori,\ndon't be afraid. It's not like that.\"\nNext, he led the little girl to Sariss\nand formally introduced them. This is\nalso my subordinate. He just arrived\ntoday, fell from the sky. Now get to\nknow each other a little. The little\ngirl was still astonished and\nbewildered, shouting, \"What? This? This\nis also master's subordinate, and that\nstrange flame was still deep in thought.\nIn comparison, the great lord doesn't\nseem that small after all.\" Sib could\nonly force a smile and explain to her,\n\"Yes, so there's no need to be afraid.\nJust like the bull-headed man, his\nappearance is just a bit.\" Suddenly, a\nfrantic voice called out, \"Great Lord,\ngreat lord, your subordinate was late in\ncoming to your aid.\" Young Master\nSibbon, great lord, you must not die. It\nwas none other than the butler and a\ngroup of familiar faces from Eagle Crest\nCity rushing in in a panic, afraid that\ntheir lord was in Donji. But as soon as\nthey reached the door, they were\nsomewhat surprised and froze solid,\nexclaiming, \"Hey.\" Sib just spoke\ncalmly. \"Anyway, let me introduce you\nall.\" Then suddenly, their eyes met.\nBoth the hellfire and the bull-headed\nman looked at each other with strange\nexpressions. After that, Sar was seen\nsaying cryptically, \"Damn it, even more\nworms.\" Not to mention this one. \"Why is\nthere a bull-headed worm of Thunderbluff\nhere?\" The bull-headed man directly\nconfronted it and replied, \"Great Mother\nEarth above. How can there be a hellfire\nhere? Has Cesar's hand already reached\nthis universe?\" The others around didn't\npay much attention because what they\nwere focused on at that moment was,\n\"What kind of monster is this?\" The\nbullheaded man continued, \"Protect the\nLord.\" Seeing the gunpowder-filled\natmosphere on both sides, Sibbon laughed\nhelplessly and said, \"All.\" He then\nreassured them, \"Everyone relax. This is\na rock man I recruited named Sar. From\nnow on, he's our comrade. He won't hurt\nanyone. But the premise is that you\ndon't touch it.\" While Lorie kept\nstaring at him blankly, thinking about\nthe hellfire, the bull-headed man\nsuddenly shouted, \"What? Great lord? Are\nyou serious?\" Although it's not a pure\ndemon, it still has demon blood flowing\nin it. a demonic structure with all\nkinds of fell energy burning on its\nbody. Are you sure it will completely\nobey your words? At this point, Sib felt\nthat the bullheaded man's reaction since\nmeeting the hellfire was strange. So, he\nasked suspiciously, \"Do you two know\neach other?\" At this time, Sarris slowly\nspoke up instead of saying, \"We know\neach other. In reality, we come from the\nsame world.\" The bull-headed man added,\n\"In my homeland, we were once forced to\ncooperate with these monsters to invade\nother worlds.\" Hearing this, Sibbon\nstroked his chin thoughtfully, thinking\nto himself, \"Invade other worlds.\"\nSariss suddenly burst out laughing,\n\"Ha!\" Then it said smuggly, \"Bull-headed\nworms of Thunderluff, it is your honor\nto be able to contribute to the great\nburning legion.\" But it only reminded\nhim in a cold voice, \"Hateful thing. The\none you must serve now is Lord Eagle\nCrest.\" The hellfire not to be outdone,\nreplied, \"Damn it. I mean, praise\nCesuras. It is my sariss's honor to be\nable to contribute to Lord Eagle Crest.\nThey kept arguing back and forth, giving\nSibon a headache. He raised his hand to\nstop them. Um, if you two giants keep\nmaking noise, my room will be destroyed.\nSend someone to repair my room.\nEveryone, go back. Just when it seemed\nlike everything was settled, Sariss\nlooked at him pitifully and asked,\n\"Great Lord, where do I go back to?\" It\nwas only then that Sibbon suddenly\nrealized and thought in confusion, \"All\nright, where should I put this giant\nflaming thing, master?\" Suddenly, Lorie\nsaid enthusiastically, \"Leave this to\nme.\" This made him a bit suspicious, and\nhe quickly asked, \"Leave it to you?\" The\ngirl just nodded vigorously, smiling\nbrightly as she replied confidently,\n\"Yes.\" In just a moment, the sky had\ngradually turned to dusk. The people who\nwent out were bewildered and confused.\nThe hellfire was arranged by Lori to\nrest in a unique spot, which was the\nsmall waterfall outside to prevent it\nfrom suddenly bursting into flames. It\njust sat there dejectedly while everyone\nelse was still whispering, \"The great\nlord's hobbies are getting stranger and\nstranger.\" Huh. Indeed, it was thought\nthat the peaceful atmosphere would just\ncontinue like this. Then, suddenly, on\nthe side of Eagle Crest City, strange\nfigures in black cloaks appeared. They\nwere moving in a large group,\naggressively advancing. The leader\nannounced, \"According to our\ninformation, Lord Eagle Crest returned\nto Eagle Crest City tonight. This is the\nbest time for an assassination. We must\nseize the opportunity.\" As they were\nwalking brazenly through the city, a\nvoice suddenly stopped them. \"You cannot\npass this way.\" This made them confused\nand suspicious. One of them even\nthreatened aggressively. \"Rotten old\nman, are you looking for death?\" The\nleader raised his hand to stop him.\n\"Wait a minute. Mama, look who it is.\nParker loser, do you still recognize\nme?\" At first, he was still confused and\nsuspicious, but when he got a clearer\nlook at the person in front of him, his\neyes suddenly darkened, and the corners\nof his mouth couldn't help but tremble.\nDay it's you. Hearing this, the man\ndidn't bother to hide anymore, pulling\ndown his hood and laughing mockingly.\nThat's right, Parker loser. If it\nweren't for those eyes of yours, I'm\nafraid I wouldn't have recognized you. I\ndidn't expect that after only 2 years,\nyou've aged into this state. Your wife's\nblood was truly useful. I feel stronger\nthan ever now. Thank you, Parker. This\nman even brazenly touched upon the deep\npain in his heart, his most beloved\nwife, with a sarcastic and mocking tone.\nI've been waiting for you to come and\ntake revenge on me, alchemy Grandmaster\nParker. But haven't you run out of magic\npower? How is a piece of trash like\nyou're going to get revenge on me? The\nold man's trembling hands took out a red\npill from a small chest, and his whole\nbody radiated a murderous aura, as he\nsaid. I originally wanted to kill a few\nHoly Temple knights before looking for\nyou. I didn't expect you to deliver\nyourself to my doorstep. He affirmed in\na grim voice. Revenge? You will see it.\nI guarantee it. Then before the\nastonished eyes of the group, he\nswallowed the mysterious pill. A\nsubordinate seeing this exclaimed in\nshock. This old man actually used a\nspecial potion, burning his life force\nas a price to reach the realm of a\nknight, didn't he? Day wasn't worried at\nall. On the contrary, he laughed with\ninterest. Ha. Number two. Number three.\nCome with me. Let's play with this old\ndog. Next, he ordered the rest of you go\nand complete the mission given by his\nholiness the pope. We must win this\nquickly. Below the castle, an explosion\nsuddenly rang out. Boom. It was so loud\nthat it even startled Sib's room\nupstairs, causing Lorie to ask in fear\nand confusion what exploded. He quickly\ngot out of bed and went to the window to\nobserve, asking with great suspicion,\n\"What on earth is going on? Why has our\nfountain turned into an erupting\nvolcano?\" Meanwhile, down below, Sarris\nwas smiling with great interest at the\ngroup of intruders in the city. Yoin\nSeus, the great Sarris must burn you to\nashes. Tremble, scream, volcano\neruption. This left them confused and\nshocked, sweating profusely as they\nwondered, \"Ugha,\nwhy is there this lava creature in Lord\nEagle Crest City?\" Then they cursed\nangrily. The people from the\nintelligence department are truly a\nbunch of vermin. His holiness the Pope\nshould burn them to death. The crowd\nfell into a panicked frenzy, shouting\namongst themselves. \"Bonda above avoid\nthe spewing molten lava.\" Eggh.\nBut the hellfire was extremely refreshed\nand excited, laughing.\nMeanwhile, they shrieked in panic. Help.\nHe stood high above, observing\ncarefully. After hearing key phrases\nlike his holiness, the pope, and bond,\nhe had a vague idea. So that's how it\nis. Then he called out, \"Lori, the young\ngirl quickly replied,\"Master.\" Sibbon\ngently stroked her head and said, \"Bring\nme my sword. You stay here in the room.\nI'll be right back.\" Lorie reminded him\nworriedly, \"Master, you must be careful\nbecause what he was concerned about was\nif they keep fighting like this, Eagle\nCrest city will be destroyed.\" After he\nwas ready, he put on his armor and\ncharged with his sword, leaving the\nPope's men staring blankly after him.\nThen they suddenly shouted, \"Another sky\nknight.\" He took note of their word\nanother. Knowing he was a sky knight\nmade them even more confused, wondering,\n\"It's the Lord of Eagle Crest, our\nassassination target. But isn't he an\nEarth Knight?\" The more they thought,\nthe angrier they got, telling\nthemselves, \"The intelligence this time\nreally has a huge problem. If we can get\nback, we'll risk our lives for something\nelse.\" Seeing the whole group ganging up\non him, he pouted in boredom and said,\n\"This trick again? Is this all you've\ngot?\" As the dignified lord of Eagle\nCrest, he didn't want to waste words on\nthese small fries. So, he unleashed his\ndragon vein power. His eyes suddenly\nblazed fiercely and his whole body\nemanated the powerful aura of a divine\ndragon. Immediately after, he just\ngently slashed down, creating a huge\namount of damage, then leaped towards\nthe Pope's men. Witnessing this ultimate\ndisplay of power made them more\nbewildered than ever, asking doubtfully,\n\"A sky knight can kill a holy temple\nknight of the earth level with one\nstrike? Damn it. Could this also be an\nold monster who became a sky knight many\nyears ago? How old is the lord of Eagle\nCrest? Is he even 25? Seeing that they\nweren't very focused, he carefully\nreminded them, \"Where are you looking?\"\nOne by one, they trembled like leaves,\nscreaming in terror, \"I'm fug.\" Then\nfrom a distance, a familiar voice rang\nout, \"My lord, young Master Sibbon.\" The\nPope's men could only grunt in\nacceptance. \"Let's regroup with Lord\nWade. We've failed this mission.\" Seeing\nthem scrambling to flee, he just stared\nat them and said in a low threatening\nvoice, \"You wreck someone's city and\nthen you want to run in your dreams.\"\nThen he shot straight up to chase them,\nmaking the people around Crane their\nnecks to look up. Over on this side, old\nParker was still struggling alone\nagainst these men. Wade couldn't help\nbut feel disappointed, saying, \"Truly\ndisappointing. A normal person\npossessing the power of a sky knight\nwith no nightly skills, nor the\nperception and experience of a knight.\nEven if you learn how to use a sword,\nyou're still just as useless. But the\nold man still resolutely charged forward\nto fight to the end to avenge his late\nwife. Suddenly, the subordinates he had\njust sent on the mission to assassinate\nSibbon returned. Calling out in panic,\n\"Lord Wade?\" This surprised him a\nlittle, and he asked, \"Number five,\nnumber seven, number 11, you're back so\nsoon. Mission accomplished.\" But it\nwasn't that easy. One of them\nfrantically warned, \"Lord Wade, run. The\nlord of Eagle Crest has become a sky\nknight. Our intelligence was completely\nwrong. And there's a powerful lava\ncreature in Eagle Crest City, at least\nat the Sky Knight level. Just then, he\nappeared behind him, a cold, humorless\nsmile on his face as he said, \"Are these\nyour last words?\" Then he slashed\nstraight down, not even giving him a\nchance to say another word. The Pope's\nmen could only stammer and utter shock,\n\"What, my lord?\" Seeing the person in\nfront of him, he exclaimed in some\nsurprise, \"Old Parker, why is it him?\nThe last time he saw old Parker, he was\njust an ordinary person. How could he\nsurvive being surrounded by three holy\ntemple knights? Now, the system\nimmediately displayed the old man's\ninformation. Name: Parker loser. Life\nforce overdrawn. Identity: Grand\nAlchemist. Strength: Temporary level 51,\nSky Knight. Skills: Advanced\nPharmaceutics. Intermediate fire element\nmastery unavailable. Basic\nswordsmanship. Equipment: Litness Sword\nExquisite. Colonel Empire Reputation\n121. He was once a nationally famous\ngrand alchemist, but now he is just a\npitiful man who lost his wife, living in\nobscurity to seek revenge. Eagle Crest\nreputation 102. Many people in Eagle\nCrest City are full of gratitude for the\nkind old Parker. However, he was very\nsurprised that such a kind person would\nresort to this method, thinking to\nhimself to actually use a special method\nto overdraw his life force, forcibly\nraising his strength to the sky knight\nlevel. Wade shouted an order to his\nsubordinates, \"You lot, go and stop\nhim.\" So, they charged forward to\nattack, obediently, replying, \"Yes!\" A\ncompelling aura emanated from his body\nas he let out a faint mocking laugh.\n\"Still want to stop me?\" But they were\nstill itching for a fight and refused to\nbelieve it. So as soon as they charged,\nhe slashed, sending them to their\ngraves. So no matter how much he didn't\nwant to believe it, he had to gape in\nastonishment, thinking to himself, he\ncan easily kill holy temple knights with\njust his sword aura. Only someone who\nhas reached the strength of a sky knight\ncan do something like this. Realizing\nthe gravity of the situation, he quickly\nshouted a declaration, \"One Parker, one\nLord of Eagle Crest. The situation is\nunfavorable now. We must retreat\nquickly. But the old man just coldly\napproached and asked in a low voice,\n\"Want to run?\" He was already eager to\nmake a quick getaway. And now, faced\nwith a roadblock like the old man, he\nangrily roared, \"Get out of the way, you\nmad old man.\" But the old man just\nsnorted coldly and replied, \"Before I\ndie, I won't let you leave here by even\na single step.\" The anger in him could\nno longer be contained. Gritting his\nteeth, he extended his sharp claws. his\nwhole body radiating a compelling aura\nas he cursed. Then you can go die. After\nthat, a murderous aura was seen\nsurrounding the old man, causing him\npain as his eyes turned bloodshot. Next,\nhe showed no mercy and charged forward,\nstabbing him straight in the stomach,\nmaking his face turned pale from the\npain. Seeing this, Sibbon screamed in\nhorror, calling out worriedly, \"Parker,\nloser!\" However, no matter how much it\nhurt, the old man refused to let go of\nhim, holding on tightly, which made him\nfurious as he cursed. \"Let go, you crazy\nold man.\" The old man endured the pain\nand made his final request to him. \"My\nlord, kill him for me.\" So he granted\nthe kind and gentle old man's wish,\npressing the cold blade of his sword\nagainst his neck, causing his eyes to\nwiden in shock and his face to turn pale\nwith fear. Then what was bound to happen\nhappened. He collapsed to the ground and\nbreathed his last while he just casually\nshouldered the sword. Parker gasped for\nbreath, laboriously calling out, \"My\nlord, I heard I heard that you also\nreally like a subhuman girl. Is that\ntrue?\" He then honestly affirmed, \"Yes.\"\nHearing this, the old man laughed\nloudly. \"Haha!\" Then coughed violently.\n\"Cough, cough.\" Finally, he managed to\ngive his last piece of advice. \"Then you\nmust you must protect her well.\" He then\nmade a promise to himself. I will\nprotect her well. As soon as he returned\nto the room, he sighed wearily.\nSuddenly, she threw herself into his\narms, hugging him tightly, which made\nhim ask with some concern. \"Lori, what's\nwrong with you?\" hearing this. The\nlittle girl sobbed even more, crying her\neyes out in his arms, saying in a choked\nvoice, \"Master, you're not hurt, are\nyou?\" I heard a lot of noise downstairs.\nLorie doesn't want Master to get hurt.\nLori really wanted to go down and\nprotect Master, but Lorie was afraid of\ngetting in Master's way. Understanding\nthe little girl's feelings, he gently\ncomforted her. Lori is not a burden at\nall. Besides, you're about to awaken.\nAfter you awaken, you might even be more\npowerful than master. At that time,\nyou'll have to protect Master. Okay. It\nwas just something he said to comfort\nthe little girl. But Lori kept\nmuttering, \"Awakening can protect\nMaster. I really want to protect Master.\nI don't want to hide behind him. Lori\nmust become stronger.\" Then her whole\nbody began to glow with a strange light,\nmaking him turn pale with worry. Just\nlike that, the little girl unexpectedly\nawakened right then and there. The whole\nroom was filled with a light so strong\nthat he had to raise his hand to shield\nhis eyes. Sibon just stood there in a\ndaysaze, not understanding what had just\nhappened. Then he stammered, unable to\nform a complete sentence. Lori, you you.\nJust then, the system panel popped up\nwith a notification. Name Lori. Identity\npersonal nun sibbons lover strength\nawakened subhuman stage 1 level 42 41 to\n50 skills wood dance of cold light oe\nendless proliferation single holy\nspirit's blessing defense ancient wood\nspring rejuvenation dispel natural\nharmony passive plant control passive\nfragrance of fortune passive equipment\nnone reputation eagle crest 28 a\nbeautiful young girl yet unknown to\nanyone one because her body and heart\nalready belonged to one person. Subhuman\nfaction reputation two few people know.\nLor's eyes were still teary and her face\nwas flushed as she asked shily, \"Um,\nmaster, what's wrong?\" He then jumped\nfor joy, grabbing her hand as if\nbursting with happiness, saying, \"Lori,\nyou just awakened. Oh, oh, that's\namazing.\" This left him completely\ndumbfounded, but she had no idea. He was\nsecretly smiling darkly, thinking a\nhealer. I, Sibbon, finally have my own\nhealer, exclusive, top tier, and knows\nhow to warm a bed. Haha. Who will dare\nsay Eagle Crest City has no healing\npower now? Can't this skill casually\nwipe out a whole group of priests? Early\nthe next morning, a voice from a small\nclinic began to announce, specializing\nin treating all incurable diseases,\nbruises, wounds from knives and guns,\nbites from poisonous insects, fees are\nfrom just one copper coin. Sariss was\nstill standing outside in a days doing\nexercises, silently scorning and judging\nthe people around him. Insects are\neverywhere, disgusting. Sariss hates\ninsects. Lorie on the other hand was\nalways friendly. Welcome. Seeing this,\nsome people around sideighed while\nothers gossip. The person who opened a\nhealing shop is actually a subhuman\ngirl. I heard this subhuman is the\nlord's new favorite AI. Maybe she opened\na shop just for fun. A beauty who\nseduces people. I still miss old\nParker's shop more. Those words hit\nSibbon like a punch to the gut, but he\njust gave a faint smile and lamented\njust as I expected. The clinic's opening\nis not going smoothly. He kept looking\naround and had to sign frustration. I\noriginally wanted to open a clinic so\nLori could be more confident and\ngradually change the attitude of the\npeople in Eagle Crest City towards\nsubhumans. But now it seems that\npeople's prejudice against subhumans is\nhard to change overnight. Then a kid\nwalking by suddenly gave him an idea and\nhe exclaimed. Then he burst out, \"Got\nit, chubby kid. Come over here.\" But the\nother adorable kid looked at him with\nsparkling eyes and asked, \"My lord, did\nyou call for me?\" White clouds drifted\ngently across the clear blue sky. The\nlittle boy pulled his mother to the\nfront of Lorie's shop and called out,\n\"Doctor, can you check on my mom? She's\nbeen coughing for several days. Sorry,\nthis child suddenly dragged me here.\"\nHis mother could only say with an\nembarrassed smile, \"Hey, isn't that\nChris's chubby kid?\" Seeing this, she\nflashed a bright smile and replied,\n\"It's all right. Please come in.\" Then\nthought happily, \"A patient has finally\narrived.\" The people nearby couldn't\nhelp but feel pity and sympathy. Oh,\nAubrey's child is so pitiful. His father\ndied in battle and his mother is gravely\nill. Everyone in the outer city knows\nabout her lung disease. Do you think she\ncan be cured? What are you thinking?\nEven the priest couldn't do anything.\nWhat can a subhuman girl do? While Lorie\nwas enthusiastically examining her, the\npeople outside, already prejudiced\nagainst her, were clicking their\ntongues, thinking old Parker is gone. So\nAubrey's mother is desperate for a\ndoctor, huh? But moment later, all three\nof them came out with cheerful faces,\nmaking everyone around them curious.\nHey, they're out already. That was fast.\nDoes her complexion really look better?\nSo they started a probe. Aubrey, your\nmother is. The boy couldn't contain his\njoy and jumped up and down happily.\nShe's cured. She's cured. That beautiful\nsister is amazing. She just gently\nraised her hand. A white light cover my\nmom. And after that, mom felt much\nbetter. The boy's mother also smiled,\ntouching her face shily and said, \"It's\ntrue. My lungs don't hurt anymore, and\nI'm not coughing either.\" The women\nnearby were astonished and quickly\nasked. So, she was really cured. That's\ntruly miraculous, but the treatment fee\nmust be very expensive, right? The old\nman next to them, who is already\nprejudiced against the clinic, added,\n\"Just as I thought, exactly like those\npriests from the church before, charging\n100 gold coins again, \"This clinic is no\ndifferent.\" Then the adorable kid\npointed at the advertisement sign,\nexplaining on Lorie's behalf, the\nbeautiful sister only took one copper\ncoin from us. Isn't it written right\nthere? Starting from one copper coin.\nThis made the old man exclaim surprise,\n\"Really? Only one copper coin? How is\nthat possible?\" Aubrey could only smile\nand confirm, \"It's true.\" Meanwhile, the\nclueless Sariss only perceived\neverything around him with a single\nword. \"Okay.\" After that, people started\nto clamor by the gods above. I have to\nhurry home and tell my old man, \"This is\ntoo too good. My daughter can be saved\nthis time. I'll bring her over for a\ndiagnosis first, and then we'll see.\"\nJust like that, the surrounding town's\npeople no longer held any ill will\ntowards Lor's clinic as they did before.\nAt this moment, a young woman suddenly\nwalked up holding a pen and paper and\nsaid cheerfully, \"So, this is Eagle\nCrest City. I've finally arrived. Look\nat that magic cannon island. Hey, is\nthis the clinic? Why are there so many\npeople? Are they lining up for free\neggs?\" At this time, the town's people\nwere competing to form a long line,\nhoping to be examined by her. While\nSibbon stood outside, carefully\nreminding everyone, \"Everyone, please\nline up in an orderly fashion. No\npushing. Everyone will have a chance to\nbe treated. Don't rush. This girl with\nglasses stood outside the window,\nsilently observing Lor's every move and\nthought, so it's opened by a subhuman.\nShouldn't the people here have a deep\nprejudice against subhumans? But this\nsubhuman girl looks very familiar, very\nmuch like the subhuman maiden that the\nLord of Eagle Crest rescued during his\npatrol. She glanced behind her and\nthought, \"Opening a clinic. Is this to\nshow that she's safe here?\" But since a\nmoment ago, someone across the street\nhas been fertively looking in this\ndirection. He saw that she was gradually\ngaining the goodwill and trust of the\nlocal people and curled his lips in\nsatisfaction, thinking, \"Not a bad state\nof affairs, Lorie.\" But what's with the\nperson peeking fertively from outside\nthe window? Then suddenly the two of\nthem stared at each other as if trying\nto identify the others. Identity. Then\nthey exclaimed in surprise, \"Huh?\"\nFirst, a system panel appeared with his\ninformation. Name: Sibin, Golden Lion.\nIdentity: Lord of Eagle Crest. Count.\nStrength: Unknown. Skills: Unknown.\nEquipment: Unknown. Reputation: Unknown.\nThreat level: Nightmare. Recognizing the\nother's identity, she quickly stroed\ntowards him and said in surprise, \"Lord\nof Eagle Crest, to think I'd meet you\nhere.\" This made him chuckle inwardly,\n\"That's my line.\" Next, the system\ndisplayed her information. Nama Yun Yon\nMay identity player scenery party\nstrength level 20 he unconsciously\ncurled his lips and thought Yan Jian May\nto suddenly meet the big shot from the\nscenery party that I often saw in posts\nwhile playing the game in my past life.\nI didn't expect her to come to this game\nworld too. She's already level 20, so\nother players are probably around this\nlevel too with highlevel ones probably\naround level 25. This young woman walked\nup to him with a bright smile and\ngreeted, \"Hello, I'm from Divine Light\nTown. I'm a traveler exploring the\nunknown mystical lands and the people of\nthis world.\" He also smiled politely in\nreturn, \"Hello there. So, big shot, you\ncame all the way from Divine Light Town\nto Eagle Crest City just for\nsightseeing.\" Gian May smiled like a\nblossoming flower and replied shily,\n\"That's right, my lord. Can I have your\nautograph?\" Seeing this, the smile on\nhis lips widened as he thought. as\nexpected of the scenery party. Look at\nthat sincere attitude towards beautiful\nthings. Here you go. Then he readily\nagreed. No problem. As he signed, he\nthought gleefully, \"Has my charisma\nalready permeated the ranks of the\nplayers?\" Seeing that the fish had taken\nthe bait, she gradually revealed a\ncunning smile. A strange aura suddenly\nappeared around Sibbon and his whole\nbody was bound, causing him to choke and\ncough, cough, cough, cough. What the\nhell is this? While Jen May just coldly\ninterrogated Lord of Eagle Crest, speak.\nWhat exactly did you do to saintest Roy\nthat day? Sibbon was still trying to\nnegotiate. Hey, if there's something to\nsay, let's talk properly. Roy, what\nhappened to her? Why tummy up like this?\nHey, then she smiled smuggly and probed.\nFeeling dizzy. These are these are the\nstun spores I worked so hard to collect\nfrom the wasteland. Struggling is\nuseless.\nAre you really concerned about the\nsaintists or are you just being lewd?\nHearing this, she suddenly remembered\nthe uncomfortable and restless image of\na saintist at that time who kept\nexclaiming, \"Ugh, my body is so hot, so\ncold.\" This made her unable to\nunderstand, and she questioned sternly\nafter you and the saintest were in the\nroom together. She fell ill the very\nnext day. Sometimes hot, sometimes cold.\nNow she's getting weaker and weaker. Add\nto that your hatred for subhumans. All\nthe heroic spirits are pointing their\nspears at you. What else do you have to\nsay? After hearing this ridiculous\nreason, he felt helpless and replied,\n\"Give me a break. I only gave her a\nkiss. Could it be that she got lovesick\nfrom seeing how handsome I am?\" Then he\npondered thoughtfully, \"The saints in\nthe game from my past life never had\nthis issue. System, do you know what's\ngoing on?\" It then dinged with an\nanswer. Insufficient current\ninformation. Host, please investigate\nthe abnormal location. Sib felt like he\nwas struck by lightning on a clear day,\nwondering in confusion. Could it be\nbecause the world line has changed? So\nno matter what I do, the players will\neventually gather to crusade against\nEagle Crest because of a saint's death.\nSo it's an unavoidable fate. Meanwhile,\nJyn May became even more certain,\npushing up her glasses and stating\nfirmly, \"I've never seen someone so\nthick skinned and shameless.\" This made\nsomeone as afraid of death as him unable\nto sit still any longer. And he hardly\nthought, \"No, I have to do something.\"\nThen he quickly snapped the ropes,\nbinding him, leaving her gaping in\nastonishment, stammering, \"You, weren't\nyou stunned?\" hearing this, he just gave\na faint smile and replied, \"Ridiculous.\nWith my strength, I can recover from\nthese measly stun spores with just a\nsneeze.\" He also solemnly declared one\nlast time to Yin Xian May. Whether you\nbelieve it or not, I didn't do this, and\nI have no hatred for subhumans. But to\nfind out the real reason Roy fell ill, I\ncould go to Divine Light Town with you\nfor a trip. This made her ask both\nsurprised and a little happy. Really?\nHearing this, Sibon began to stroke his\nchin with a sly smile and affirmed,\n\"Really?\" Next, he picked up the rope\nthat had just bound him and said\ncunningly, \"Really?\" But before we go,\nhe she saw his devilish smile and full\nof vigilance asked offensively, \"What do\nyou want to do? Don't come over here.\"\nLorie also hurried over and asked,\n\"Master, were you looking for me?\" He\nthen patted her shoulder and said, \"The\nclinic is temporarily closed. Come with\nme on a trip.\" This left her a bit\nconfused, but she still obediently\nreplied, \"Yes.\" Seeing this scene, Jyn\nmay had to ponder. This is the subhuman\nmaiden who opened the clinic. Could it\nbe that what the Lord of Eagle Crest\nsaid is all true that he doesn't have\nany hatred for subhumans? We\nmisunderstood him. Although the young\nwoman was still extremely resentful\nwhile he was happily humming a tune,\nLorie remained confused, not\nunderstanding what was happening.\nSomewhere else, people were buzzing with\ndiscussion. Has the protagonist Yiha\nbeen found yet? Ever since Yihow said he\nwas going to find a cure for the Saints,\nhe still hasn't returned. The devil\nknows where he is now. They were even\nall furious as they cursed. Ma, it's all\nthe Lord of Eagle Crest's fault. D in\nminute. We have to destroy him sooner or\nlater. The more they talked, the more\nworked up they got. Not only destroy\nhim, but we must also whip his corpse.\nBefore he could even finish his\nsentence, Sibbin suddenly appeared from\nbehind him, carrying the bound Gen made\ndown in his arms. To the astonishment of\nthe surrounding people, he just said\nfaintly, \"We're here.\" Suddenly, he felt\nthat something was wrong and exclaimed\nin surprise, \"Huh?\" Then he saw the\nsystem continuously report a series of\ninformation. \"Ding! Abnormal location\ndetected!\" Ding ding. Bzt Bzz analyzing\nabnormal location. Ding detected.\nDetected abnormality with child of\ndestiny. Yehow. The fate line has been\nsevered. The world line cannot. Bz zt\nbez cannot be restored. Ding.\nAbnormality detected with subhuman\nsaintis roy. Analyzing rescue measures.\nDing. No rescue method currently\navailable. Forcibly initiating the third\nstage of the plot. Kidnap the subhuman\nsaintis. Sisroyy's life has 2 hours\nremaining. Bz zt be bzz. Host, please\nexecute immediately. Host, please\nexecute immediately. He looked at the\nsystem panel and couldn't help but curse\ninwardly. Is the system crazy, spitting\nout so much information? At this moment,\nthe subhuman people looked at him as if\nhe were their mortal enemy. They even\nfuriously discussed, \"It's the Lord of\nEagle Crest. Brothers, everyone, take\nthe Lord of Eagle Crest life to avenge\nour Lord.\" Sibbon was dazed, listless,\ncontemplating life. Only two hours of\nlife left. There's no time right now. I\ndon't know anything about Royy's\nproblem. But according to the systems\nhint, it's definitely closely related to\nYihow. He suddenly thought of a good\nidea. The only way now is to quickly\nbring Roy to Eagle Crest City and have\nLorie see if she can cure her. No sooner\nsaid than done, Sibbon quickly drew the\ntreasured sword from his back, intending\nto handle the trouble before him\nsingle-handedly. The guards swarmed\nforward, flailing their limbs as they\nrushed to attack Sibbon. This bunch of\nsmall fry knew everything except who\nSibbon was. Sibbon casually swung his\nsword twice, creating an X-shaped stream\nof spiritual energy that directly cut\nthe group of people in two. He shouted\nloudly, \"Get out of the way.\" Sib walked\nstep by step into the castle to find\nsomeone. Our hero had to go through\n7,749\ntribulations just to find his beloved's\nroom. Sib kicked the door open and\nstormed in. He was dead tired. He was\nfuming. smoke practically coming out his\nears. The maid, who had just finished\nwiping Royy's body and was about to\nleave, heard the forceful sound of the\ndoor being kicked open. The girl was\nstartled and looked over. \"Who are you?\"\nHe walked in silently. Sibon didn't have\ntime to answer the girl's question. He\nrushed to Royy's bedside. Roy lay there\nbreathing with great difficulty. Her\npale face made him feel a pang of\nheartache as he asked, \"How did you end\nup like this?\" \"All right, let's go.\"\nSibbon casually took the towel from the\nmaid's hand and wrapped it a few times\naround Royy's body. He lifted her up.\nSib held Roy with one arm, letting her\nlean against him, while with his other\nhand, he drew his treasured sword and\nraised it, unleashing his divine power\nto shatter a corner of the castle. The\nmaid almost fainted at the sight before\nher. From the sky, a beast, half bird,\nhalf animal, landed on the castle. Sibly\nplaced Roy and his disciple on its back\nand left immediately. He was worried to\ndeath about Royy's condition. That beast\nflew away from the castle, flapping its\nwings and gliding gently through the\nair. It flew over towns and the crowds\nbelow immediately rushed out, pointing\nand cursing Sibbon terribly. Lord\nEaglerest has kidnapped the Saints. That\nLord Eaglerest, he actually\nbroke through to Sky Knight. Sooner or\nlater, someone will destroy you. Who's\nmessing with you? Why are you so worked\nup? Scene changed to London Dong City.\nSibbon immediately took Roy to the\ntreatment room. She lay on the bed, her\nbody writhing in pain. Roy had a\nconstant high fever. Don't. The girl\nwhimpered, continuously having\nnightmares. Sibbon watched her with\nworry and pity. Lorie noticed this. The\nyoung girl stepped forward, channeling\nher power to suppress the spiritual\nenergy and heal Roy. Over an hour passed\nand Lorie was also exhausted, her energy\ngradually depleting. Roy on the bed\nstill showed little improvement. It was\ntruly worrying. Suddenly, Lorie could no\nlonger stand steady. She collapsed onto\nthe cold tile floor, her body unable to\nhold up any longer, Sibbon ran to catch\nthe young girl, asking worriedly, \"Lori,\nare you all right?\" Looking at Lorie's\nhaggarded face, Sibbon couldn't bear to\nlet the young girl continue staying\nhere. Lorie leaned against him and\nconfessed, \"Master, Lorie has no way to\ncompletely eliminate this power. I can\nonly temporarily suppress it. The young\ngirl sobbed. Sibbon knew he had to\ncomfort her. He patted her shoulder and\nsmiled gently. This isn't your fault.\nYou've been using your powers non-stop\nfor a day. This morning, you even\ntreated so many of the thief's people.\nLori, you've already done very well. No,\nit's not. Lori didn't think so. The\nyoung girl cried harder, burying her\nhead in Sib's chest and sobbing. Her\nsituation is very complicated. Lorie can\nfeel a stream of evil power invading her\nbody. It's a kind of mark that cannot be\ndispelled. It has burrowed deep into her\nsoul. The reason she can't wake up now\nis because this evil mark has dragged\nher into a nightmare. If we want to\ntruly remove this mark, it depends on\nwhether she herself wants to overcome\nit. Is that really so? Sib looked at Roy\nin silence. But there was something\nSibon was quite curious about. He was\nfull of questions as he continuously\npatted the little kid's head. Why is\nLori suddenly so enthusiastic? Roy\nwhimpered in fear again. how pitiful she\nis. Sibbon had been sitting by her bed\nfor a long time, constantly encouraging\nhimself to think of a way to help Roy\nescape death. Although there's no way to\ndirectly save Roy's life. Perhaps I can\nhelp her a little in her nightmare. In\nRoiy's nightmare, the past and present\nappeared before her eyes, one after\nanother. Roy shed tears of blood and\nagony as countless demons appeared\naround her. They continuously pointed\nand criticized Roy. Roy, you are a\nsaintist. You must serve her highness\nthe goddess properly. Roy, go memorize\nthe scriptures. Roy, why couldn't you\nawaken this time? Roy, I brought you out\nof the orphanage hoping you could become\nan outstanding saint. Roy, you must not\ndisappoint my expectations. Roy, the\nsubhuman nation's revenge. Roy, protect\nthe subhumans. Roy, is anyone going to\nsave her? In another dream, Roy was\nescorted by them to a prison. She was\nbound tightly by hundreds of interwoven\nchains. They dug into her flesh and\nbones. one by one and the blaming voices\nof the ghouls rang out again. Roy cried\nand begged, \"Stop talking. Please stop\ntalking.\" Her tears had run dry.\nSuddenly, by some miraculous power, the\nmassive chain was severed. Roy fell\nfreely and frantically. She passed into\nanother dream. Roy fell into a deep\nbottomless body of water. She just kept\nsinking with no strength left to resist.\nThe feeling of being submerged in the\ncold water was so peaceful. Roy closed\nher eyes and let go of everything. She\nreally wanted to just sink like this.\nJust like this. Damn it. Countless arms\nrose from beneath the water as if by\nsome demonic force. They frantically\ngrabbed Royy's body, pulling her down\nquickly. The demons wouldn't let her go.\nRoiy's eyes flew open. She raised her\nhand high. Don't. She tried to struggle\nfree from the hundreds of arms. Dear Roy\nlooked up at the ray of light on the sea\nsurface. She hoped that on the surface\nof the sea, someone would be willing to\nreceive her. The moment she was about to\ngive up, a boy's arm directly and\nforcefully grabbed Roiy's hand. Roy felt\na ray of warmth transmitting from that\nhand. Someone had come to save her.\nRoy's eyes widened in surprise. Sibbon\nhad found Roy in the nightmare. He held\nRoiy's hand tightly and gently pulled\nher from the deadly water. The two\nlooked at each other full of longing.\nThe beast just circled in the air a few\ntimes. Roy couldn't believe her eyes.\nShe asked herself, \"Lord Eagle Crest?\"\nThere was no mistaking it. It was that\ndamn Sibbin, the most detestable person\nin her thoughts. Roy struggled with all\nher might. Roy was shy. Why are you\nhere? Sibbin cheerfully teased her. This\nyoung master, of course, came to snatch\na corpse. Roy, however, was very\nstubborn. She kept struggling.\nUnbelievably, the mean Sibbon dared to\nlet go of her with both hands. Roy\ntumbled onto the beast's back. You\nvillain, you've hurt this girl to death.\nRoy struggled to sit up. Sib felt a\nlittle guilty. He knew his joke had gone\na bit too far. Sib moved to help Roy up.\nWho would have thought? She directly\ngave him a punch to the cheek that hurt\nlike hell. She looks so weak, yet if\nshe's not kicking wildly, she's using\nher fists. Sib was damn addicted to it.\nNice. This young master likes this wild\ntype. Roy screamed and threw a tantrum.\nYou let me down now. Sibbin was afraid\nthat if she struggled a little more, she\nwould fall flat on her face and die. He\nordered his little pet to land in a\ndeserted villa area. Without waiting for\nthe bees to land, Roy quickly jumped\ndown like a flying motorcycle. The kid\nis really something else. Roy jumped\ndown too fast and twisted her ankle. The\npain shot up to her brain. It hurt so\nmuch it reached her navl. Roy gaed and\nstood there without moving. Sib just\nmanaged to pull her into his arms,\nafraid the kid would fall. He gave her a\nroguish smile. Hey, hey, this is a\ndreamcape. How can it hurt? You're not\nreally pretending, are you? Roy looked\nat him, then down at her own feet. The\npain was gone. It seemed it really\ndidn't hurt at all. Could be she was\nhallucinating. Roy forcefully pushed\nSibbon away from her. This guy in\ngeneral couldn't be trusted. What do you\nmean by what you said? Is this really a\ndreamscape? Sib put on a serious\nexpression and nodded. That's right.\nThis is your nightmare. If I hadn't\nexpended a hypnosis scroll to connect to\nyour consciousness and rush here to save\nyou, you would have been long gone\nbefore sunset. You detestable guy. Roy\nturned her face away, pouted, and said,\n\"Dreaming of you is the real nightmare.\"\nBut she was a little curious. Roy\navoided Sibbon's gaze. She fidgeted\nshily. But why did you save me? Sib\npretended to think. He sighed. There's\nno why. I was afraid that if you died,\npeople would say you died of\nlovesickness for missing me too much.\nThey put all the blame on my head. Then\nI'd be so wrong, wouldn't I? Sibbin\nlightly stroked his vine chin, full of\nself- admiration. After all, I'm this\nhandsome. It's quite convincing, isn't\nit? What? Roy bristled with anger. Who\nsaid I was infatuated with him? You're\ntruly shameless. Let's drop it. Sibon\ngrabbed Royy's hand and ran quickly in\none direction within the mansion\ngrounds. All right, let's go quickly. We\nhave to find the exit now or we'll\nreally be trapped here until we die. The\ntwo ran into a gate. Royy's cheeks\nflushed slightly. Her heart pounded\nerratically as she looked down. That sib\nguy was holding her hand. They continued\nto pass through. The countless classical\narchitectural styles of these buildings\nwere truly eye-catching. Roy struggled\nagain. Hey, let go of my hand. Found it.\nSib quickly led her by the hand to the\nplace he mentioned. Sibbon looked at the\narchitecture with interest. This place\nlooked a lot like a cathedral. It seems\nthe most frightening thing in your heart\nis this place. I think the exit must be\ninside a cathedral. Just hearing about\nit, a series of unpleasant memories\nsurfaced in Royy's mind. The Roy in the\nmemories was so weak. Don't. Please\ndon't. The girl cried miserably. She\nbegged. She tried to run. But in the\nend, there was only one outcome. Roy\nlooked at the cathedral, trembling. She\nclung to Sibbon's hand and beg. I I'm\nnot going. Sib was surprised to feel\nRoiy's fear. She was trembling. Is that\nso? The thing that scares you this much,\nthis is it. The direction is definitely\nright. Let's go. You have to go even if\nyou don't want to. Behave for me. Sibon\nabruptly threw Roy over his shoulder. He\nran quickly into the cathedral. Roy\npounded on his back. Ah, you demon.\nStanding majestically. In the middle of\nthe hall was a large statue. Roy and\nSibbon curiously ran over to take a\nlook. What is this? This statue, isn't\nit, Roy? She wondered, \"Why is there a\nstatue of the saint is here? The\npredecessor? Clearly, the one placed in\nthe temple should be the wild goddess\nMin.\" Sibbon didn't pay much attention\nto what Roy said. He turned in all\ndirections, observing everything. Then\nhe unconsciously asked again, \"Oh, so\nthis is the predecessor.\" He clicked his\ntongue in disdain. The quality of the\nsubhuman suses is really going downhill.\nWhat? Roy shot him a look full of love.\nHey, what's with that look of yours? Sib\nsaid nothing more. He grabbed her by the\ncollar and dragged her away. Let's go.\nLet's find the exit. Roy was fuming,\nletting that sib guy drag her away. But\nthat statue, she couldn't take her eyes\noff it. There was really something wrong\nwith it. Just as Roy and Sibbon\ndisappeared from view, the statue's eyes\nturned blood red, looking very\nfrightening. Deep within those eyes was\nan indecipherable skull. Along the\ncathedral's corridor, Roy and Sibbon\nheaded towards a room at the end of the\nhall. They walked quickly to\ninvestigate. Sibbon curiously threw the\ndoor to that room wide open. It was a\nclassroom. A woman was standing at the\npodium writing something for her\nstudents sitting below. How strange.\nWhat kind of class is as silent as a\ngraveyard? It's spooky. Roy walked over\nto look inside. She asked Sibbon in\nsurprise, \"Why is the classroom from my\nchildhood orphanage here?\" He of course\nknew very well. This is your nightmare.\nIt's normal for places in a dream and\nthe real world to be different. Lady\nMalia stood with her back to the board.\nShe wasn't writing anything. In fact,\nshe was using her hand to scratch\nfuriously at the board. Countless\nscratch marks were clearly visible.\nSibbon didn't pay much mind. He took her\nhand and said, \"The door is in there.\nLet's go.\" Roy didn't think so. She held\nhis hand back. Wait a minute. There's\nsomething wrong with that person in the\nmirror. Roy could see that she was being\ncontrolled by someone. There was a very\nspecial symbol on her neck. Lady Malia\nturned around angrily. She grabbed the\nrot cane in her hand and swung it\nforward a few times. Annoyed by the\nnoise, she said, \"Roy, you disobedient\nchild, get back to your seat quickly.\"\nRoy, out of habit, immediately trembled\nin fear. As if hypnotized, she walked\nquickly to the study desk. Yes, Lady\nMalia. Sibbon, frantic with fear, called\nher name. Roy, where you going? Don't\nwant her off. Come to me. Suddenly, that\nlady Malia angrily rushed over as if she\nwanted to eat them alive. She\ncomplained, disobedient children want a\nbeating, don't they? Sibbin's eyes\nwidened in fear. Malia swung the cane\nwith great force into the space between\nwhere Roy and Sibbon were standing.\nDamn, that's vicious. Is this the kind\nof force you use to hit a child? Sib\nangrily gave her a kick to the stomach.\nAfter being kicked, Malia immediately\nstaggered back a distance and knelt down\nin pain. A long while later that Malia\nonce again walked quickly to the center\nof the classroom. As if it were a joke,\nshe waved her cane and signaled, \"It's\ntime for music class. Let me hear your\nsinging.\" All the kids in the class\nstood up. They scratched the desks hard\nwith both hands, leaving rather deep\nmarks. Each child then began to wail\nlike the moans of ghouls from hell. That\nsound was truly harmful to a listener's\nears. Sib covered his ears tightly in\nfrustration. This sound is so\nunbearable. If you can't win a fight,\nyou resort to mental pollution. Roy\nrealized something was not right here.\nShe looked at each of the fiercefaced\nchildren. Roy lightly touched her heart.\nThis is my childhood orphanage. These\ncontrolled children and the hot-tempered\npastor Malia are all from my childhood\nmemories. Roy let out a helpless sigh.\nDozens of children surrounded the\npastor. Malia stood imposingly in the\ncenter full of anger. She looked around\nagain, interrogating. Who took my\nglasses? Hand them over now. If I have\nto find you, you'll get 50 lashes. A\nmischievous little boy was holding the\npastor's glasses. He giggled and\ncarefully hid them behind his back.\nMalia followed the sound of the laughter\nand looked over. She smirked and looked\nin the boy's direction. So, you're over\nthere. Sibbon was about to go and save\nthe boy. Roy quickly stopped him. Roy\nsignaled for him to be quiet. She can't\nsee. Sib looked at Roy, puzzled. She\ncan't see. How do you know? Roy turned\nto face him and whispered, \"This is my\norphanage.\" She was the pastor who\nmanaged his children back then, \"Malia.\"\nRoy looked towards the pastor, her eyes\na little sad. In my memory, Malia's\neyesight wasn't very good, but her\nhearing was extremely sharp. She could\nsniff everything out by sound. As soon\nas she finished speaking, Malia rushed\nfrom out of nowhere to attack them. The\nforce she unleashed was immense. A\nsingle punch could shatter a large\nsection of the wall. Sib grabbed Roy and\nflew up to dodge. He couldn't help but\nexclaim, \"So that's how it is.\" He took\na coin from his pocket. He now\nunderstood why Roy was so aggressive.\nViolent education. No wonder it produced\na saintist who likes to get physical and\nhit people. Malia stood still, observing\nthem. Although she couldn't see, her\nsense of hearing was excellent. There's\ndefinitely someone in front. Sibbon\nsecretly tossed the coin he had prepared\nonto the floor, letting it roll into a\ncorner. Just as Roy had said, the pastor\nimmediately ran in the direction where\nthe coin had fallen. She mercilessly\nswung her stick, beating each child\nwho's being disobedient. Sibbon seized\nthis opportunity, immediately, grabbing\nRoy and running for their lives. Right\nnow, let's go. The two of them quickly\nenter the door. Sibbon held Roy floating\nin midair. That door connected to\nanother space. Something wasn't right.\nThey looked up to see a super giant\npuppet falling down. That dimension\nopened up and the puppet along with Sib\nand Roy was pushed out. Roy landed on\ntop of him in pain. Have they been\ntransported to another castle? Sibbon\nwith one hand squeezing Royy's bosom\ncomplained. That hurts like hell. What\nis this thing? A puppet? Roy shily\nlooked down at his mischievous hand.\nHey, you pervert. Move your right hand\nnow. What do you think you're doing?\nSibbon immediately switched hands,\nlooking at her suggestively. Oh, you\nprefer this side, you despicable Sibbon.\nRoy, blushing furiously, slapped him.\nGet up. No more joking. Sib sat up and\nlooked around in a daysaze. All right,\nwhere is this room? Roy placed her hands\nover her chest and shook her head. This\nplace looks so familiar, but she\ncouldn't remember. Suddenly, Roy said\nexcitedly, \"It's my room at the Divine\nLight Town Garrison Manor.\" Sibbon\nrealized. It seems the rooms in this\nnightmare are all formed from the most\nterrifying places in her memory, created\nfrom her most painful recollections. We\nhave to find the next door to get out.\nRoy looked behind him, pointing at the\nshadow on the wall. Lord Eagle Crest,\nbehind you. The super giant shadow\ngradually loomed over them. Roy sat down\nin fear. This giant puppet wasn't\noriginally in the room. Sib looked up at\nthe puppet. Your terrible memories are\ntruly numerous. This is Wait a minute.\nSibbon froze for 5 seconds. He and that\npuppet looked exactly alike, didn't\nthey? Whoa. Whoa. What the hell is this?\nThe two of them just stood there staring\nat it speechlessly. Sibbon turned to\nlook at Roy. Knowing her guilt, she\nfeigned ignorance and looked away. Sib\npicked up his replica and held it in\nfront of Roy to interrogate her. He said\ncheerfully, very cheerfully, \"It's fine.\nNo problem at all, my lady saints. Don't\nyou think this puppet looks a lot like\nsomeone who is risking his life to save\nyou? And this is your terrifying\nnightmare? Roy hugged it, unable to deny\nit. Isn't it very cute? All right, she\nwalked over to the mirror. Roy bent\ndown, her hand pointing to a door on the\nfloor. Look, the door is to your south.\nSince you were just lying there, why\ndon't we just go? Sib tossed the damn\npuppet aside, looked at the opening\ndoor, and happily stepped inside. This\ntunnel is so dark. Sibbon complained to\nRoy as they walked. He felt a little\ndead inside, finding it unacceptable.\nNot only was it a huge doll with no\nattack power, but it also helped you\nopen the door. In the end, what kind of\nimage do you have of me in your heart?\nRoy didn't know how to explain, so she\nswallowed her grievances and followed\nhim. Isn't it great that there's no\nconflict? Why is this place so dark?\nSuddenly, a beam of light from a door at\nthe end of the hallway attracted them.\nSibbon happily took Royy's hand and\nmoved forward. There's light. That must\nbe the exit from the nightmare. Let's\nget out of here quickly. Sibbon felt a\nsense of unease wash over him. He\nobserved silently. There were footsteps\nof someone approaching. Roy looked at\nSibbon a little puzzled. Why did you\nstop? Sibbon signaled for Roy to be\nquiet. Do you hear a strange sound? It\nwas Saintis Barrow approaching with a\nleather whip in her hand. Barrow walked\nover, raised the whip she had prepared\nand brought it down again and again on\nthe Roy from the memory. Barrow angrily\nordered her subordinates. Why haven't\nyou memorized the scripture yet? Someone\nlock the saint in the repentant cell for\nme. The young girl under Barrow could\nonly sit there crying and begging. I'm\nsorry. Roy was thrown into a dark\nprison. She knelt and begged her.\nBarrow, I'll memorize it. Please let me\nout. It's too dark in here. Roy now\nrealized where she and Sibbon were\nstanding. Barrow, this is the prison\ncell. Barrow was really standing before\nRoy and Sibbon. She stood there coldly,\nholding a weapon. Upon meeting her,\nSibbon was struck by love at first sight\nfor this woman. His eyes filled with\nlove as he rejoiced internally. Oh ho,\nshe's the real former saintis. Even more\nof a doppelganger than the other one,\nSibbon happily walked forward to greet\nher. Hello, beautiful big sister. Before\nhe could say more than a few words,\nBarrow immediately attacked. Sib vomited\na mouthful of blood, looking at her in\nsurprise. A chain had pierced through\nSibbon's chest, holding him tightly in\nmidair. Good thing this is a dream,\nSibbon thought excitedly, so\nenthusiastic. Sibbin looked at the chain\npiercing through his body. His divine\npower was being consumed considerably.\nZulf the feeling surpassed the strength\nof a sky knight. Roy looked up at him\nworriedly from below trying to shout to\nSibbon. Lord Eagle Crest, are you okay?\nAlthough Sibbon was in some pain, he\nstill tried to act fine to reassure her.\nI'm Phoenix, he realized, getting hit in\nthe dreamscape weakens the scrolls\npower. If I'm attacked by this kind of\npower again, I'm afraid the scrolls\npower will completely vanish. But what\ncan I do if I can't fight back? Sibbon\nsuddenly thought of Roy. That's right.\nThis is a dreamscape. All power must\noriginate from the master of the\ndreamscape. Sibbon struggled to hold on\nagainst the chain. His spiritual power\nwas draining rapidly. If he delayed any\nlonger, he was afraid. He ordered Roy.\nRoy, quick, imagine me as the most\npowerful character you could think of in\nyour nightmare. Roy looked at him a\nlittle surprised. The most powerful\ncharacter. Roy recalled the moment she\nwas locked in the prison hugging a\nstuffed rabbit. So dark. So dark. I\ndon't want to be locked in here. It was\nthat cute little pink bunny. Roy called\nout, \"Mr. Rabbit.\" Sibbon instantly\ntransformed into a muscular, masculine\npink rabbit. He gently flicked the chain\naway. Sibbon was completely clueless\nabout what was happening. What is this\nsituation? Why did I turn into a rabbit?\nWhatever this will do. He quickly rushed\ntowards Barrow. A person and a rabbit\nkept punching each other. The spiritual\npower radiating from them oppressed a\ncorner of the room, truly making it hard\nto breathe. And of course, with the\npower of the original owner, Roy, Barrow\nwas completely defeated. She gradually\ndissolved, revealing part of her body to\nbe a hideous ghoul. It angrily pointed\nat Sibbon and cursed. The demon king was\nfully revealed. It screamed in pain\nwithin the deep blue spiritual power.\nThe giant demon vanished into the void.\nRoy ran to the pink rabbit, Sibbon,\nlooking at him and sobbing. Lord\nEaglerest, your body is fading away. Sib\nlooked at his own fading illusion. He\nsadly instructed Roy, \"The scroll's\npower is gone. Next, you have to rely on\nyourself to get out.\" He reminded her\nworriedly, \"Hey, Subhuman Saints, you'd\nbetter not disappoint me.\" Roy nodded in\nagreement, happily watching him\ndisappear. Goodbye, Sibbon. I will\ndefinitely get out. Back in the abyss of\nCan the demon territory, countless bolts\nof lightning and fire converged in one\nplace, with each bolt striking down\nfiercely. Yeihow jumped out from the\nlightning, collapsed in pain, and\nvomited blood. That Yhow screamed madly,\n\"I was just defeated. How could I fail?\"\nA voice echoed from the earth. \"You have\ndisappointed me greatly, Yeihow.\" Yehow\nsaid nothing more, sitting still and\npanting heavily from exhaustion. The man\nin the black cloak slowly approached and\nreprimanded him. \"You were actually\nseduced by the abyss of K for temporary\npower.\" Yihow looked at him angrily and\nshouted, \"Isn't it because you didn't\ngive me more power?\" He cried miserably.\n\"That prophecy skill is useless.\nWhat could I do? Just stand by and watch\nmy woman be snatched away by that\nhateful lord?\" The man in the black\ncloak was truly furious. His voice\ngrowling as if he wanted to eh how\nalive. You waste just a mere vessel. Yet\nyou failed so miserably. I told you long\nago that I am using all my strength to\nprevent the counterattack of this\nworld's will. To create an opportunity\nfor my citizens to invade this world. I\ndon't have much time to pay attention to\nyou. You just needed to lead my people\nwell. And even if you encountered that\nvariable, you could still stand in an\nundefeable position. But what have you\ndone? We could have relied on our people\nto slowly grind away the vessel's\ndivinity. Then take over her body, but\nyou secretly traded her divinity with\nthe abyss. What's even more ridiculous\nis that you could even sell the proof.\nYour foolish actions have ruined my\nplan. He looked at the half man,\nhalfdemon Yihow, and gave him one last\nchance. If you continue to be so\nobstinately blind, don't blame me for\nusing your body as the new vessel. The\nman in the black cloak ordered, \"There's\nno more time. The second descent is\nabout to begin.\" Chapter 56. Returning\nto the real world, Lorie looked\nworriedly at Roy and Sibbon lying on the\nbed. The little girl had been standing\nguardier all night. Lorie dragged her\ntired body and sobbed helplessly. \"When\nwill Master wake up? A whole night has\npassed.\" Sib lay motionless. Roy turned\nover and hugged him, sleeping soundly.\nTime passed just like that. Lorie\nanxiously paced back and forth a few\ntimes, her eyes red. At this rate, will\nthere be any danger? That's right. Lorie\nrecalled what Chris had taught her. I\nabsolutely cannot let my teacher down.\nI've got it. Appropriate physical\ncontact and dressing up can make a\nperson feel safe. That's what Miss Chris\ntaught me. Lorie naively believed these\nwords. She ran straight to her small\nwardrobe, rumaging through it to find a\nfew of her favorite outfits. Lorie\nlooked at the pile of clothes in her\nhands. Does master prefer black lace or\nwhite lace? The noise from the little\ngirl somewhat helped wake Sibbon up. He\npropped himself up, groaning lightly in\nexhaustion. Suddenly, a fierce clap of\nthunder came from outside, lighting up a\nlarge patch of the sky. Lorie was\nstartled and looked out the window. Wow,\nis it about to rain? It's raining.\nSibbon opened his eyes wide, staring at\nthe ceiling. He couldn't move his arms\nor legs. Sib was a bit dazed. What is\nthis? What the hell are these shorts?\nSibbon glanced over. Lorie, in a\nseductive nurse outfit, was walking step\nby step towards him. In her hand, she\nwas even holding a syringe. Is she going\nto give me a shot? Sibbin was wide\nawake. Lorie reached out to touch him.\nSibbin reflexively grabbed her hand.\nPerhaps he had frightened her. Sibbon\nsat bolt upright, his hand pulling her\ncloser. The close contact between them\nmade Lorie blush uncontrollably. Master,\nyou're awake. Sibbon looked at her.\nLori, why are you dressed like this? Do\nyou even have to ask? Of course, it's to\nhelp Master wake up faster. That Miss\nChris is so effective. Lorie was visibly\nhappy. Damn it. Sib glanced outside,\nunable to help, feeling bitter. The\nculprit is you again, that woman, Chris.\nGoodbye. Happened to hear that the\nmaster was awake. He ran in and happily\njoined the group. He gave a thumbs up.\nGoodbye. winked at Sibbon. Master, do\nyou like it? Sibbin looked her over,\nstroking his chin as he slowly thought.\nFor a great man like me, having one or\ntwo perverted hobbies is nothing\nstrange. Of course, I like it, but\nremember to only wear it when it's just\nthe two of us. As for Roy, although she\nhasn't woken up yet, her life probably\nisn't in danger for the time being.\nSibbon stretched exhausted and yawned a\nfew times. Lori, we don't need to keep\nwatch anymore. Let's go to sleep. Lorie\nnodded obediently and leaned into\nSibbon's arms, looking at him coetishly.\nMaster, the thunder outside was so loud\njust now. Lorie was scared. Master said\nbefore that after Lorie awakens. We\nwould have a baby, right? WTF? Sib's\nface turned green. Who would promise a\nchild that? No wonder Lori has been so\nenthusiastic lately. So, this is the\nreason. Somebody save me. Sib stammered.\nUh, Lori, you go to sleep first. It's so\nlate. You have to go to the clinic\ntomorrow, right? As for now, Sibbon\ngrabbed his pants and ran first. He shot\nout like a motorcycle. Lorie watched his\nretreating back, her face turning purple\nwith anger. Master, you clearly you're\nlike that. Sib ran out of the room and\nlocked the door tight. Although he felt\nguilty towards her. I'm sorry. It's not\nthat I don't want a Lori. This is all\nfor your own good. Ding. System\nnotification. Host has kidnapped the\nSaints. Received 20,000 villain points.\nDing. The system screen flashed\ncontinuously for unknown reasons. Globe\nbeta 2 of the king continent have been\ndetected to have opened ahead of\nschedule. Repair failed. Ding. System is\nupdating. System update complete.\nVillain store has added new barracks.\nHost, please check. The system earnestly\nbegs Sibin. Host, please check\nimmediately. Ding. Check immediately.\nDing. Quick. Look. Look. Sib looked at\nthe screen worriedly. Why is it moving\nagain? He tapped the system repeatedly.\nThis isn't right. The system updated\nagain. The players have already arrived\nfor Globe beta 2 so fast. Rezen told\nSibbin that something was wrong. In his\nmemory, the number of players in the\nsecond part was 10,000. If they were to\nattack his lawn dong city, although he\ncould escape, the city would be gone.\nSo, what kind of lord would he be? The\nlord of hell would be gone. Sibbon stood\ndefiantly outside the room in just his\nass bearing shorts. He repeatedly tapped\nthe crappy system, but this system had\nbeen getting more and more urgent since\nlast time. So, the system actually has\nemotions. It's not the reincarnated\ndamned lord from the game in my past\nlife. Is it system? Can you normally see\neverything I do? See? No matter how\nhorsely Sibbon asked, the system\nremained dead silent. Sibed until he was\nblue in the face, urging, system, I know\nyou're there. Don't play dead. Ding. The\nsystem cannot share vision with the\nhost. It can use energy to perform an\nanalysis of the environment around the\nhost. The host can rest assured. Your\nprivacy is placed at the highest\nposition within the systems authority.\nUh-huh. Sibbon laughed sinisterly. He\npointed at the system again. Ah, so\nthat's how it is. He cursed inwardly.\nStupid system. Idiotic system. The\nsystem is a forever alone loser. So, it\nturns out that when I was cursing the\nsystem in my head and planning to\nexploit its loopholes, it wasn't that\nthe system was playing dead, but that it\nsimply didn't know. Other people's\nsystems are all masterminds.\nSpecializing in dominating the host,\nseizing power and even usering the\nthrone. The more Sib thought, the\nangrier he got. Other people's bosses\nand my boss. My boss is like a piece of\nMy system is like an imbecile\nforce to sell its life. The key is that\nit has to work like a dog and has no\npower at all. Let's see what the new\nfunction of this works like a dog system\nis like. He pressed to start the\nupgrade. Current authority only allows\nunlocking level one troop buildings.\nGuard camp can recruit troops. Crusader\ndivine archer requires 20,000 villain\npoints to exchange. Beast pen can\nrecruit troops. Beastman infantry.\nBeastman Spearman requires 20,000\nvillain points to exchange. Shadow Guild\ncan recruit troops. Shadow assassin.\nShadow crossbowman requires 25,000\nvillain points to exchange. Lava Pit can\nrecruit troops. Gargoyle, fire elemental\nrequires 20,000 villain points to\nexchange. Graveyard can recruit troops.\nSkeleton soldier. Skeleton Archer\nrequires 15,000 villain points to\nexchange. Lost forest can recruit\ntroops. Trant Black Panther requires\n15,000 villain points to exchange. Sib\nlooked it over for the first time. He\nfound it very strange. What the hell is\nthis? I can understand the crusader and\ndivine archer up front, but what are the\nones after? Scene changed to the real\nworld. Longfam was leisurely eating with\nhis mother. He deliciously put piece\nafter piece of food into his mouth. A\nnotification suddenly appeared on his\nphone. Globe beta 2 of the king\ncontinent is about to begin. Really? Sib\nexcitedly picked up the phone. All\nright. He flew out of the dining room\nlike a motorcycle. He only managed to\nsay a few words to his mother before\ndisappearing. Mom, you go ahead and eat.\nI'm not eating anymore. Has the weather\nturned strange today? His mother sat\nthere unable to help but worry. This\nkid, are you a cat eating so little?\nLong fam ran back to his room and shut\nthe door tightly. He once again lay in\nthe time machine to enter the game. The\nsystem immediately received the signal\nand chimed\nding-dong. The game continent is\nstarting new version detected.\nConcontinent version 2.0 update\ncomplete. Logging in with 10 identities.\nWelcome to the can continent. Wish you a\nhappy gaming experience. Happy gaming\nexperience. Longfam opened his eyes wide\nand looked at the screen. Only now did\nhe realize this is a new expansion pack.\nOver here at Lawnong Fortress, Roy lay\non the bed writhing and groaning in\npain. Without Sibbon accompanying her,\nshe was still immersed in that\nnightmare. Once again, Roy remembered\neverything. The image of Roy first\nmeeting Sib. He coldly killed countless\npeople. The legendary cruel lord. That's\nwhy in the arena she was so scared that\nshe lay still on his shoulder, letting\nhim carry her away at will. Suddenly,\nanother memory pierced through Royy's\nbrain. In the distance, the image of\nYihow. He cried his heart out for her,\nbegging Sibbin to release her. How\ndifferent. How could they be so\nheartless to me? Long Fam sensed Royy's\nexistence. He made up his mind. Can Roy\ndon't die coming. Can continent starting\nscene change? Yehow gathered all the\npowerful heroes from all over. He stood\non a high place and declared in a loud\nclear voice. I am very happy to see so\nmany heroic spirits here today. You are\nall the hope of Guang Town. Seeing that\neveryone is in high spirits today, I\nwon't say much more. I'm sure everyone\nalready knows the purpose for which we\nestablished the purifier guild. Yehow\ndrew his sword, raised it, and shouted.\nThat is to kill Lord Eagle Crest and\nrescue Sis Roy. That's right. The crowd\nbelow was almost brainwashed by him.\nThey enthusiastically supported this\nidea. The whole group shouted with great\nspirit. Kill Lord Eagle Crest. Rescue\nSaints Roy. Yiha unleashed his spiritual\npower and flew straight into the air.\nHis divine powers surged, shining so\nbrightly, it was blinding. His\ncultivation had risen by a level. Yihow\nled the crowd. He screamed. His eyes now\nseemed to have surrendered his soul to\nthe devil. This is merely the darkness\nbefore the dawn, meaning good will\nultimately triumph over evil. The crowd\nbelow looked at him drooling. With this\npower that everyone coveted, Yeihow was\ntruly the idol in their hearts. Holy\ncrap. Level 53. The protagonist is so\ndamn cool. He's a sky knight. Hacking is\nthe most dangerous. We all misunderstood\nbrother How. Brother How truly lives up\nto his name. Saintis is saved. Saintis,\ncan you see? You have to hold on tight.\nBrother How is rising up. Brother, how\nlead us to kill the Lord and get his\nloot. I'm the best. Yeha is smug about\nbeing worshiped like this. He continued\nto boast loudly. Lord Eagle Crest, I\nwill definitely expose your evil face\nfor all to see. Returning to Lawn Dong\nCity. What scheme is Sibon up to now? He\nslowly approached filled with a\nmurderous aura. If that's the case, I\nwon't pretend anymore. Sibbon pushed the\nsmall Lori down onto the bed. He\ndirectly tore her maid outfit to shreds\nwith one hand. So perverted. We're not\n18 yet. Author, please have some\nself-respect. Sib looked at her with a\ncovetous gaze. Lorie fearfully covered\nher chest. She cried and screamed. Lorie\ndoesn't want to be a bed warmer anymore.\nMaster. Master is a bad guy, a\nscoundrel, a pervert. Sibbon grabbed\nLor's fair white arms. He directly\npushed her down. This villain pinned the\nyoung girl's hands above her head. Sib\nlooked all over her body. He smiled\nslightly and reminded her, \"No one can\nsave you today. You must warm the bed\nfor this young master or I will eat you\nup. Pervert. Lorie sobbed and struggled\nfrantically under Sibbon. Very good. The\ngoal has been achieved. The systems\nnotification sounded. Detected that the\nhost forced his maid to warm the bed. A\nvicious and inhuman act, awarding 5,000\nvillain points. The host must continue\nto strive. Sibbin was overjoyed in his\nheart. Nice. The stupid system. Let me\nfind a bug. Mission complete. Sib got\noff Lorie without any regrets. He stood\nthere looking at her happily. All right,\nthe experiment is complete. This is good\nenough. Lorie sat up, utterly\ndisappointed. Aren't we moving on to the\nnext step? Is that all? Sibbon nodded\nrepeatedly. He winked at her and\nordered, \"This is good enough. From now\non, we'll perform this once every night\nbefore bed.\" Lorie looked at him\ndisappointed. Her face fell. Master. The\nyoung girl sat there without saying\nanything. Lorie's face showed that she\nhad something on her mind. Sib was\ndumbfounded and asked curiously, \"What's\nwrong?\" The young girl took a deep\nbreath. She looked at her master shily.\nMaster, please be honest with Lorie. Do\nyou have some strange preferences? WDF?\nSib was speechless. How should he answer\nthis? I am screwed. Sib swallowed\nnervously. He stammered. No, it's not.\nLet me explain. His brain was trying to\nsqueeze out an explanation that the\nyoung girl wouldn't doubt. But why is it\nso hard? How could he explain to Lorie\nthat he wasn't a pervert, but was just\ndoing this to earn villain points. Lorie\nmoved closer, pressing her chest against\nhim. Master, if you have any strange\npreferences, just tell Lorie. Lori will\nseriously consider Master's request.\nThis girl, stop talking. Sibbon gritted\nhis teeth and shut his eyes in agony.\nBut everyone in the household was\nextremely supportive of him being a\npervert. Drops of sweat drenched\nSibbon's face. Seeing her master in such\nan awkward position, Lorie couldn't bear\nto make things difficult for him. The\nyoung girl suddenly remembered\nsomething, and Lorie immediately turned\nand ran off. It's time for my lesson\nwith Miss Chris. Master, please wait for\nLorie's learning results. Sibbon sat on\na soft bed, letting out a sigh of\nrelief. She's finally given up. All\nright, I'll wait for you. After waiting\nfor Lori to be truly out of sight, Sibon\nexcitedly accessed the system. This is\ndefinitely not avoiding the problem.\nRegardless of the second globe beta, I\nshould test the systems barracks first.\nSystem stores sentry post detailed\ninformation. Sentry Post, a structure\nfor recruiting human unit types,\ncrusaders, divine archers. Detailed\ninformation at the Sentry Post, you can\nspend 50 villain points and two gold\ncoins to recruit a crusader, or spend\n100 villain points and two gold coins to\nrecruit a divine archer, providing\nenough iron or can reduce the\nrecruitment cost by half. Note,\nrecruited units are system units that\nwill completely obey the host and\npossess a certain level of intelligence.\nSib thought excitedly. This is awesome.\nHaving a barracks means having military\npower. So my situation can change from\npassive to active. All right. What am I\nwaiting for? He immediately started\nsystem. Exchange for the sentry post for\nme. Ding. Sentry post exchanged. Current\nvillain points 30,450.\nDoes the sentry post need a location to\nappear? Appear in the castle's rear\ngarden. Sibbon immediately teleported to\nthe rear garden and the surrounding\nscenery changed instantly. He landed\ngently from above. So gently that a\nlarge corner of the rear garden was\nreduced to a pile of ruins. Sib stood\nthere and looked up with difficulty. Oh,\nhow convenient. Hey, system first\nrecruit for me five crusaders and five\ndivine archers. The system appeared\nholding out an empty box in front of\nSibon. Payment on delivery. Ding. Host,\nplease deposit funds. No money. No\ntroops, you get nothing. Sibbon\nunderstood the problem. He took a bag of\nsilver from his pocket and tossed it\ninto the box. Quite advanced, huh? I\nthought it would directly deduct my\nmoney. Sibbon nervously watched the\nsystem close. But what was that ugly\nsound it was making? Why is this box\nmaking a sound like jammed money? It\ncan't be right. Recruitment complete.\nThe system immediately spat a bag of\nsilver back out at him. Sib looked at\nthe bag of silver full of question\nmarks. Huh? Is this my change? firmly\ncollecting fees only according to the\nprice list. Suddenly, from behind the\ncastle gate, dozens of uniform footsteps\nechoed. Through the hazy smoke,\ncountless cavalrymen emerged one by one.\nThey lined up in two neat rows and\ngreeted Sibbon. Assembled for the Lord.\nSibbon nodded in satisfaction at these\nsoldiers. He was a bit flustered. No\nneed to shout so loudly, otherwise it\nwill be extremely noisy later. So very\nannoying. Sib walked up to the leader\nand observed him carefully. The system\nthen displayed his identity. It turned\nout his name was Truang Tam. Identity:\nCrusader. Strength level 15 swordsman.\nSkills: Shield bash. Passive battle\nformation. Equipment. Common Crusader\nshield. Common Crusader long sword.\nCommon standard crusader armor.\nReputation: Eagle Crest territory one.\nThis soldier is willing to die for you.\nSibbin, you should show some concern for\nthis new soldier. He asked him gently,\n\"Trang Tam, right? Are you hungry? Do\nyou want something to eat?\" Being cared\nfor by his master like this. Trong Tam\nstood at attention happily and shouted\nloudly, reporting to the Lord. Trang Tam\nhas enough food and requires no\nsupplement. Sib used the system to scan\nthese soldiers again. He was a little\nsad. It seems the soldiers from the\nbarracks lack intelligence and emotions,\nbeing more like fighting machines that\ndon't care about eating or drinking\noutside of combat. Ding. The system\nreminded him, \"Host, be advised. The\ndeath plot is about to begin.\" \"What?\"\nSib looked at the system map and paced\nback and forth in alarm. So, the attack\nhas already been launched. Daily villain\nquest updated. Villain quest one,\neliminate at least 2,000 players.\nVillain quest two, the level 500 players\nback to level zero. Villain quest three,\nrepel\nrevenge. Note, killing players can earn\nvillain points. This mission is tied to\nthe host's life and death. Please be\nprepared. Sibbon was worried. No,\nagainst players who can revive\ninfinitely. These mentally deficient\nsoldiers are not enough system. I need\nto exchange for the sky knight\nbreakthrough potion. Very well. Exchange\nsuccessful. The sky knight potion has\nappeared. All right. Sibbin ran hastily.\nHe did a spectacular flip in the air,\ndirectly snatching the bottle and\nleaving. Sibbon shouted loudly. Crimin.\nAs soon as Crimman heard that familiar\ncall, he stopped teaching martial arts\nto the soldiers. Crimin looked at him in\nsurprise without blinking. Huh? Young\nMaster Sibbon, are you also here to join\nthe training? Sibbon didn't answer. He\nthrew the bottle to Crimin. That's not\nwhat needs to be done now. This is for\nyou. Crimin habitually caught it. He\nlooked at the bottle in his hand and\nasked Sibbon curiously, \"What is this?\"\nSibbon didn't have enough time to sit\nand explain everything to him. He urged\nhim, \"It's very good for you. Drink it\nquickly.\" \"Yes, young master.\" Hearing\nhis master say so, Crimin didn't\nhesitate to open the cap and gulp down\nthe potion in the bottle. Everyone\naround excitedly watched for Crimin's\nchange, whispering and gossiping among\nthemselves. Sib calmly watched him and\nthought to himself, not a moment's\nhesitation. This loyalty was not a waste\nof my potion. A moment later, Crimin's\neyes widened in pain. That potion was\nabsorbed into his body really fast. He\nsuddenly felt a stream of spiritual\nenergy running through his body. Crimin\nclenched his fist to endure it as\ncountless blood red streams of power\nsurged through him. Crimin has leveled\nup to a new power. Crimin absorbed all\nof that power. He couldn't quite believe\nit. He was about to cry. Crimin joyfully\nlooked at the spiritual energy flowing\naround his body. I never thought that in\nthis lifetime this old man could break\nthrough to sky night. It's all thanks to\nthe master. Crimin shed a tear, ran over\nand knelt to thank Sibbon for the grace\nhe had bestowed. Young, young master,\nthis old servant. Before he could finish\nspeaking, Sibbon happily helped him up.\nHe looked at his loyal guard. Don't\nkneel. There are many important things\nwaiting for you to do. Crimin looked at\nhim in surprise, full of questions. What\nis it, young master? Just give the\norder. Sib stood before tens of\nthousands of soldiers and announced, \"I\nhave received information that an army\nof subhumans from Guangtown is about to\ncharge here. All the soldiers were quite\npanicked. Crimin ran to his side. He\nwanted to ask for the reason but\ncouldn't bring himself to speak. He\nworriedly reassured himself. A battle is\ncoming. Why so suddenly? But no, now is\nnot the time to talk about this. Kman\nraised his blade high and order the\nsoldiers. Everyone attention. Set up\nseven defensive lines outside the city.\nPrepare rolling stones and calrips.\nAnnounce to the entire city to enter a\nstate of combat readiness before 12:00\ntonight. Soldiers inform all citizens to\nevacuate from London Dong City. The\nsituation is critical. No one dares to\nbe negligent. They each went to their\ntasks and carried them out quickly. Kman\nlooked at Sibbon. That gaze was the same\nas always. He cherished his master the\nmost. Therefore, young master, rest\nassured. I will definitely risk my life\nto protect the safety of London city and\nyou. Sibbon could feel Crimman's\ndevotion. He also stood there looking at\nhis age guard. It's been a while,\nCrimin. You're still the same. Sib also\nhad to hurry back to prepare. He put on\nthe legendary lord's armor. The armor\nset was specially designed for him by\nCrimin. Lorie ran over, looking at him\nwith tearary eyes. He just gently\nstroked her cheek. From outside came\nTrouang Tam's urgent report. My lord.\nSib looked at his frantic appearance and\nwondered, \"What's wrong with you?\" Trang\nTam breathed with difficulty and\nreported the subhuman army you mentioned\nhas appeared. They are currently less\nthan one kilometer from London City. The\nnewbies have arrived. Sibbon didn't seem\nto care about them. Calmer than calm, he\ntried to act a little surprised and\nexclaimed, \"That was fast. I thought\nthese players wouldn't arrive until\nnoon. How badly do they want to grind me\nto dust?\" Sibbon gently ordered Lorie.\n\"Lori, go see if Roy is awake yet. I'm\ngoing to the city wall to check the\nsituation.\" Lorie obediently accepted\nthe order. \"Yes, master.\" The young girl\ncouldn't bear to let Sibbon leave. She\nreminded him, \"You must be careful.\"\nScene change. The atmosphere at the wall\nof London City was frighteningly silent.\nThere wasn't a hint of wind today, and\nthe air was uncomfortably stuffy. Sibbon\nquickly appeared there, observing his\nsurroundings cautiously. Sibon asked the\nguard, \"So, what's the situation?\" The\nsoldiers stood guard all around. They\nhad arranged their troops and formations\non the city wall, perhaps so solid that\nnot even an ant could get through.\nSuddenly, a notification from the system\nappeared. Player killed by a poisonous\nsnake bite, causing severe psychological\ntrauma. Received 20 villain points. Sib\ncalmly used binoculars to observe the\nenemy's every move. He shouted, \"They're\nalmost here. Prepare for battle.\"\nReceiving the order, the soldiers moved\ninto their pre-arranged positions. The\nsystem displayed thousands of\nnotifications again. It was about to\noverheat. Player drowned in sewage,\ncausing severe psychological trauma.\nReceived 20 villain points. The players\nunder Sibbon's arrangement, dozens of\nthem fell into traps, dying like flies\non the road. Some panicked and abandoned\ntheir comrades to flee. Oh my god, it's\nhappening again. The players silently\ncursed Sibbon's ancestors for three\ngenerations. Who set such an immoral\ntrap? The pit was so deep. And on top of\nthat, there were a dozen venomous snakes\ninside. What snakes? Someone was\nvomiting uncontrollably, reminding\nothers, \"Don't say it. This damn pit is\na cesspool.\" I'm starting to get scared\nof you, my dear. But the thing is, the\nmore of these mutants died, the more\ntheir numbers doubled upon respawning.\nCreepy, isn't it? The group said\nsmuggly. Lord Eagle Crest would never\nhave expected it, right? We've set up a\ntemporary resurrection crystal here.\nEven if we die, we can revive as usual.\nAll players, please be advised. The\nlarge-scale war quest attack on London\nCity has begun. Main quest. Kill Lord\nEagle Crest Sib, the Golden Lion.\nOptional soup quest rescues ray quest\nreward one. All players who accept the\nquest will receive 30,000 experience\npoints. Players who kill enemies will\ncontribute to an experience pool. After\nthe battle, the experience pool will be\ndivided among everyone. Experience\npoints can also be used to exchange for\nmemory cleansing potions from Yihow,\nvalued at 1,000 experience points per\nbottle. Quest reward two, common grade\nequipment and hero grade equipment are\nfree for the taking. Quest reward three,\ngold coins free for the taking. Quest\nreward 8, After completing the quest,\nall players participating in the\ncampaign will receive the title\noverthrower of Eagle Crest. The excited\nmutants shouted in a frenzy. The quest\npopped up. The quest popped up. The\nexcited crowd stared at the quest screen\nbefore them, their eyes greedily\ncoveting those rewards. Number of\nplayers on the battlefield has reached\n5,000. Activating Legion campaign buff.\nCurrent buff level is LV1. All players\nreceive plus 20 plus two per level\nstamina and plus 10 plus two per level\nspeed. All players respawn countdown\ntime is hald and experience points\ndeducted upon revival are half. Faith\npoints daily increase by 20 + 5 per\nlevel. The temporary resurrection\ncrystal's defense rating is increased by\n100 plus 50 per LV. The mutants under\nYihow's leadership swarm towards the\nwalls of London City. The crowd had just\nbeen equipped with a series of new\npowers. As a result, they were\nincredibly energized, shouting at the\ntop of their lungs, \"Holy crap, we've\nbeen buffed. Charge!\" The smell of\nstill lingered in the air, causing the\nmutants to gag and vomit on the spot.\nThey swore an oath. Generals and\nsoldiers. Today we attack this guy and\nloot for 3 days. Otherwise, how can we\nwash away the shame of having to swallow\ntoday? I'm dying of laughter. Sib\nstood high above, observing this amusing\nscene. The fragrant smell of in\nlife. You need to experience everything.\nNo need to thank me. He ordered Jeang\nmagic cannons. Free fire. Let's give\nthem a taste. Without hesitation, Jeang\nimmediately ran to activate them.\nCountless cannon barrels aimed directly\nat the ant-like swarm of mutants below.\nThis time I'll give you a belly full of\nshells. One, two, three, light the fuse.\nFire. Countless fireballs were shot out,\nexploding with a deafening roar. See how\nformidable I am, sweetie. Once again,\nhundreds of fireballs exploded among the\nmutants, causing dizziness and ringing\nears. The mutants cried and begged for\ntheir lives as they died under the fiery\nbarrage. Help. A considerable number of\nmutants were annihilated. Some Legion\ncommanders quickly ordered their troops\nto evacuate. Mage Corps spread out\nquickly. Watch out for those strange\ncannons. Don't clump together. Spread\nout now. And yet, there were still many\nstubborn ones. They set up ladders,\nintending to climb the city walls. The\nleaders ordered, \"Everyone get out your\nprepared grappling hooks.\" After a while\nof scrambling up the walls of London\nCity, the siege ladders are limited and\ncan be easily knocked down from above.\nIt's hard to guarantee the first wave of\nattack. We can't rely solely on the\nladders. The speed of climbing the wall\nmust be fast. Mages, prepare to provide\ncover. Revived mages, quickly reinforce\nand continue providing support. Don't\nrun around chaotically. Revived mages,\nquickly reinforce and continue providing\nsupport. Don't run around chaotically.\nSib looked at the situation before him\nand sighed wearily. Those mutants just\nkept reviving one after another. It's\ntruly inconvenient. As expected, I still\nhave to destroy the player's\nresurrection crystal. Although the magic\ncannons are extremely powerful against\nso many people, it's just a drop in the\nocean. But after destroying it, I must\nretreat immediately. Once I'm surrounded\nby over 8,000 players, the consequences\nwill be unimaginable. Sib suddenly\nthought of a way. He looked down\nexcitedly. Is that thing shining like a\n36? What light bulb beh? That bastard\nactually dared to come. He must have\ngotten stronger. It's just that he's too\nfar away for me to see his face clearly.\nIt was time for Sibbon to enter the\nbattle. He quickly drew the treasured\nsword from his back. His aura sword and\na source of divine power surged forth.\nIts oppressive presence shining\nbrilliantly around him. Sibbon gave an\norder to Grim. Grimman, I intend to\nleave the city and take the offensive.\nYou stay behind and keep an eye on Yeha\nfor me. Grim obeyed the command, bowing\nhis head as he saw Sib off. Yes, young\nmaster Sibbon. Outside the city, the\nstone man Sakin and his soldiers were\nstill diligently standing guard without\nrest. Sibbon walked over and called out\nto him, \"Sarakin.\" As soon as he heard\nhis name called, he glanced over. \"It's\nthe master. The master is calling me. He\nmust need help with something.\" Sakin\ntried to drag his heavy body over to\nSibin. With an incredibly innocent look\nin his eyes, he respectfully greeted\nhim. \"What is it, my respected lord?\"\nSibbin pointed to the area opposite the\ncity. Do you see those three crystal\nstructures behind a mutant army? Sarakin\nasked naively. The one with a glowing\nbug in the middle. Did he just call ye\nhow a glowing bug? Sib clutched his\nstomach, choking with laughter. He\nplayed along and nodded in agreement.\nThat's right. He didn't hide anything\nand said it outright. I remember you\nhave a skill called hellfire descent\nwhich can fall directly onto a\ndesignated location from above the enemy\nwithin a certain range. Sibbin ordered.\nTherefore, your mission is to descend\nfrom above the crystal structures and\nthen help me destroy them. Sib carefully\nreminded Sarakin, \"Kill as many mutants\naround the crystals as you can, but\nafter you've destroyed them, you must\nfight for no more than 10 minutes and\nthen return.\" Sarakin looked at the\nmutants, happily waving his arms and\nlegs, full of energy. Bursts of thunder\nand fire enveloped his body, growing\nlarger by the moment. Sakin chuckled.\nSarakin is best at this. Sabotage,\ndestruction, and death. All right, he\nordered Sarakin to go. A second later,\nSarakin had vanished, leaving only a\ntrail of green smoke. Sarakin is off.\nSib turned and continued to summon\nanother of his subordinates. Ben\nBlackhood, a demon warrior, immediately\nappeared. He bowed before Sibbon. I am\nhere, my lord. Sibbin ordered. After we\nleave, the task of defending the city\nwalls is entrusted to you. Ben agreed\nwithout hesitation. He reassured Sibbon.\nRest assured, my lord. I swear to the\ngreat mother earth that I will\nabsolutely not let the enemy step past\nthese city walls. Very well then. Let's\ngo. Sibbin ordered the city gates to be\nopened before the eyes of the mutants.\nThe gates of London city slowly opened.\nAt first, the mutants thought Sibbin had\ntaken the wrong medicine. They shouted\nfor their comrades to gather around.\nLook, the city gate is opening. Some\nwondered, \"Is Lord Eagle Crest planning\nto charge in a battle?\" It's not that\nsimple. Lord Eagle Crest definitely\nintends to destroy our respawn point.\nLast time at Black River Ridge, he most\ncertainly saw our temporary respawn\npoint. And besides, the temporary\nresurrection crystal is already quite\nobvious. And the main character, Yeihow,\nstanding in the middle, shines even\nbrighter than us, like a high-powered\nlight bulb. Lord Eagle Crest isn't\nblind. Needless to say, the whole crowd\nturned in unison to look at that foolish\nei was sweating bullets. Realizing the\nmutants were starting to suspect him, he\nraised his voice to explain, \"I'm here\nto protect the resurrection crystal.\nRest assured, heroes with me here, Lord\nEaglerest absolutely cannot get even\nhalf a step closer. Let's just close our\neyes and trust him for now for the fun\nof it. What if we get our faces smashed\nin later?\" Suddenly, Grimman appeared\nout of nowhere, swinging his sword and\nslashing repeatedly at Yihow. Defeated\nfoe, surrender your life. Damn it. What\nthe hell? He was attacked by surprise.\nYiha almost lost his life. Luckily, he\ndodged to the side. Yihow took advantage\nof Grim's inattention. Quickly drew his\nsword and the two clashed wildly as\nexpected of the main character. His plot\narmor is truly formidable. The mutants\nbelow didn't know whether to be happy or\nsad. I can't believe this clueless main\ncharacter. This won't do. It's better if\na portion of us always stays back to\nprotect the crystal. Although we brought\nscrolls, we're almost out. Setting up a\nnew crystal requires a 30se secondond\ncool down. The crowd changed their plan.\nUnderstood. Everyone protect the\ncrystal. Over at London City, the moment\nthe gate fell, Sibbin and his soldiers\nappeared aggressively, their imposing\naura truly humbling. The mutants stared\nwideeyed at Sib. The gate is open.\nSomeone's coming out. Everyone look.\nThat's Lord Eagle Crest. Sibbin Golden\nLion Sky Knight. Level 52 Nightmare. The\ntruth was revealed again. And the whole\ncrowd nearly fainted. Holy He's\nactually nightmare grade. Someone crowed\nloudly. What's there to be afraid of,\nbrothers? With so many of us, we can\ncrush him with our numbers alone. Our\naverage level is 15, and we have 1,000\nplayers over level 20. What the hell are\nwe afraid of? That's right. That's\nright. Not scared. Not scared. Na na na\nbo. Don't forget our mission. We have to\nrescue her highness, the saintest. After\nstruggling against Grimman for a while,\nYiha clearly began to lose ground. Lord\nEagle Crest breaking through to Sky\nKnight was nauseating enough. On what\nbasis did this old man also get to break\nthrough to Sky Knight? Who's the real\none with the hacks? Suddenly, a scolding\nvoice echoed in Yihow's mind. It was\nthat black cloak man. He was cursing\nhim. are you trying to\nconquer the world? You should be glad\nyour new world hasn't been invaded yet.\nDon't you have any self-awareness of\nyour own capabilities? Yehow, the\nconnection between this world and my\nworld has had a breakthrough, so I can\ntemporarily modify the rules of this\nworld for a period of time. The black\ncloaked man began to chant, \"The real\nworld and the dark world began to turn\nupside down. Is this variable how you\nsave yourself? can. If you turn back\ntime for everything and still only make\nthis little progress, then you will\nultimately still be unable to escape the\nfate of destruction. What is this? The\ntime loop seemed to be reprogrammed.\nSibin watched an alarm. The system panel\nhad also been modified. What is this?\nThe pressure is so strong. The system\npanels of hundreds of players quickly\nsend a notification. Main boss detected.\nLord Eagle Crest Sibbon the Golden Lion.\nDue to the vast level difference\nmodification initiated, modification\ncomplete. Attacking Sibin, the Golden\nLion will inflict mandatory true damage.\nDamn it. Sibbin realized there was a\nproblem with this system. Does the\nsystem mean that Lord Eagle Crest has\nfinally been weakened? He's been\nweakened. Sibbin was confused, a little\nworried by his premonition. What the\nhell? I suddenly feel a chill like\nsomething bad is about to happen. Just\nas he sensed, that guy launched a sneak\nattack, but he managed to block the\nblow. you dare to sneak attack, battle,\nor a defense. And yet, this small\nmissile still hit him, sending him\nflying a short distance away. Sibbon was\ncaught completely by surprise. His knees\nbuckled and he fell to the ground,\nluckily supported by his sword. He\nwondered, \"How could a tiny fireball\nbreak through his defense?\" The man, the\nbrown cloak, was ecstatic, tearing up\nwith joy. This was the taste of victory\nfor him. I broke his defense. I dealt\nthree drops of damage. I'm so moved. I\nfinally didn't miss anymore. The\nunderlings behind him, their eyes lit\nup, exclaimed continuously, \"Holy crap,\nhe really did it. Holy crap, that's\nawesome.\" Meanwhile, he was still\ncelebrating, \"I'm so good.\" Now,\naccording to the quest, his battle\naura's protective mechanism must have\nbeen weakened. I told you, how could a\ngame issue a quest that we can't\npossibly complete? Sakin now looked\nnormal and was suddenly slashed across\nthe body by Sibbon's sword. minus\n872,367.\nOnly then did Sibbon reflect on the\ncurrent situation. In short, he now knew\nwhat that nameless chill was. His\ndefensive battle aura had actually\nbecome ineffective. But luckily, his\nattack power wasn't reduced. This battle\nwas a matter of life and death. He had a\nwin no matter what. Full of fighting\nspirit, he raised a sword and signaled\nhis soldiers to attack. All troops, hear\nmy command. Kill. The hooded man's\naccompllices were no slouches either.\nTheir eyes lit up as they rushed towards\nSibbon like vultures spotting a juicy\nprey. Target Lord Eagle Crest. Control\nhim, brothers. Charge. They charged\nforward, one grabbing his neck, another\nhis leg, and another pulling Sibbon's\narm. He had no choice but to use a great\ndeal of power to make them explode. From\nthis move, he himself was significantly\ninjured with only about 30 of his life\nremaining. These guys were truly\ncountless. Seeing Sibbon injured, they\ncheered even more joyfully. Mage\nplayers, stop being shields. We should\nsacrifice ourselves. Let's go. Fire at\nhim. Don't spare a proud flower like me.\nWe succeeded. We injured him. Brothers,\ngo again. We'll win in no more than\nthree rounds. Sib wiped a bit of blood\nfrom the corner of his mouth, rethinking\nhow to deal with this mob that used\ntheir bodies to overwhelm him. This\nwon't do. The players can revive\nindefinitely. At this rate, I could die\nfrom exhaustion alone. He shouted\nloudly. Sarakin speed up. Giant energy\ndiamonds appeared and gathered into a\ncolossal figure that rushed towards\nthem, exploding thunderously. They were\nsent flying everywhere like cockroaches.\nThe giant man was completely unharmed\nand roared in anger. Insects, insects\neverywhere. Death sprouted like\nmushrooms. Sib's giant laughed with glee\nwatching these freaks being scattered.\nKaaka. This was the Hellfire Lord\nSarakin, the ash skull great demon who\nhad reached level 55 nightmare grade.\nSarakin let out a series of roars. The\ncracks on his body all emitted powerful\nenergy beams. Destruction, annihilation,\ndeath. The ones who were just demanding\nto kill Sib could now only cower in a\ncorner and pray. They were in an uproar.\nHoly crap. What the hell is this thing?\nWhy does it look like a hellfire demon?\nWhy is there another one? Could it be\nthat because Lord Eagle Crest was\nweakened, we're now surrounded by three\nnightmare grade bosses, then what was\nthe point of weakening him in the first\nplace? Two leaders of the soldiers\ndiscuss with each other, \"We've run into\na ghost. There are bosses everywhere.\"\nOn Yihow's side, there's an old knight,\nalso a knight. No. The person next to\nhim refuted, \"That's not right.\" Lord\nEaglerest is diverting our main force's\nattention. His real purpose is to back\ndoor us quickly. Tell everyone to be\ncareful with the resurrection crystal. A\nsoldier rushed over to report\nbreathlessly. Brother Fan, the\nresurrection crystal can't hold on much\nlonger. Hearing the report, Brother Fan\nwas both panicked and annoyed. What? How\ncan be so fast? Where's the super strong\nphysical defense? Where's my double 200\ndefense power? With that, he signaled\nfor those around him to stop and\nannounce to the players, take all the\nresurrection crystals and temporarily\nwithdraw. Yehow is tied down. We need to\nstop the hellfire, Lord. The soldiers\nheard the command. We will obey.\nAbsolutely. Roger. After the\nannouncement, he immediately bolstered\neveryone's morale. Everyone persevere.\nThese are all Lord Eagle Crest generals.\nIt's true that we're facing three bosses\nat once, but the quest requirement is\nonly to kill Lord Eagle Crest. Then he\nchanneled his power, causing his energy\nsources to radiate in many directions,\nsignaling for all soldiers to advance\ntogether. Now split a group to harass\nthe hellfire lord. Don't let him destroy\nthe crystal easily. The siege players\ncan return to help surround and kill the\nlord boss. Sibbin was injured but\nhearing their words. He couldn't help\nbut laugh. You think you can kill me\nwith just this? Dream on. The soldiers\non the other side heard his words and\npanicked. They kept encouraging each\nother. Hang in there. This guy start his\nflag lines. Sibbon was startled. His jaw\ndropped. Did I just set a flag?\nSuddenly, he felt his body being\nregenerated with energy. The wounds on\nSibbon's body gradually disappeared\ncompletely. His body was recovering.\nSomeone was healing him. This light is\nIt's her whipping around. He saw was\nLauria. Sib was alarmed. Aren't you\nlooking after Roy? Go back quickly. It's\ndangerous here. The little girl rushed\nforward, hugged his waist tightly, and\npleaded, \"No, I must stay by Master's\nside, and help Master.\" I awakened my\nbloodline power with great difficulty.\nIf I can't even help master at a\ncritical moment, then what's the point?\nSibbon was touched. He looked at her\nwith a gentle gaze. Lori, if that's the\ncase, then follow me. You must not leave\nmy side for a single step. Do you\nremember? The little girl obediently\nreplied, \"Yes, I remember, master.\" Now\nit's Lorie's turn to protect you. While\nSibbon's side was joyful. On the other\nside, the noisy mob attacking him was\nwideeyed and open-mouthed, sharing the\nnews. \"Hey, hey, look at this. Are you\ncrazy?\" They look towards Sibbin, who is\nrecovering and growing stronger and\nbroke into a cold sweat. Holy crap. Lord\nEagle Crest is healing. And he has a\nhealing buff, too. Where on earth did\nthis subhuman girl come from? Why is she\nhelping Lord Eagle Crest? I've been\nfighting for so long. Where are the\ndevelopers? Is no one noticing an NPC\nhacking in this game? Where did this\nsubhuman Lorie come from? They quickly\nlooked up the little girl's information\non the system. The screen immediately\ndisplayed the information. Name: Lori.\nIdentity: Maid Lord Eagle Crest Love.\nStrength awakened subhuman. Stage level\n43 41 to 50 levels. Threat: Nightmare.\nOther common nightmares unknown. A few\nof them felt her name was very familiar.\nLori, why does that sound so familiar? I\nfeel like I've seen it somewhere. Damn.\nQuick, check the quest rewards. Found\nit. They all opened the system to check.\nQuest reward for special NPC follower,\nsubhuman maiden Lori. Note, this NPC\ncannot be forcibly subdued. Requires\nmemory cleansing potion. This reward is\nunique. Now they finally realized. No\nwonder the required memory cleansing\npotion was a question mark. This is King\nLove. Her favorability rating has\nprobably maxed out and the threat level\nis so damn realistic. Being hugged by\nLord Eaglerest makes her nightmare\ngrade. While they were still wondering\nabout so many things, Sibbon had already\nstarted his attack. Wherever he went,\nhis overwhelming power crushed people.\nThey all clamored, \"Holy crap, he's\ncoming.\" With one hand holding his sword\nand the other around Lorie's waist,\nSibbon reminded the little girl, \"Lori,\nhold on tight.\" Lori obediently\nlistened. Lori is holding on tight. This\ntime, Sibbon unleashed a ferocious\nbeast, charging straight towards the\nenemy. The leaders reassured their\nsubordinates. \"Don't panic. Don't panic.\nMages, get out of the way, warriors.\nWarriors, try your best to die at the\nboss's feet to create obstacles for him.\nAll players, mages, concentrate your\nfire. Kill the healer in the boss's arms\nfirst. They crouch down playing in a\nsneak attack style. Sib about to be hit\nby the same Daochon like move from\nbefore. Just realized it and cursed\nunder his breath. Son of a This\ntrick again. The noisy mob had blocks of\npower ready in their hands. Small\npreparing to attack Sibbon. Mages get\nready. They unleashed everything on\nSibbon in one go. They cheered with joy.\nLevel three converging flame art. It's a\nhit. One of the leaders of the soldiers\ncheered happily. Did we succeed? I\nwonder how much damage it will do. It's\nstill at full power. A level three flame\nemper art is so powerful. It should at\nleast break the mage shield. But he\nforgot that it's not over till it's\nover. After their less than graceful\nattack, Sibbon and Lorie stood there\nwithout a single scratch. This was a\nscenario they truly hadn't considered.\nHow is this possible? I dealt over 1,300\ndamage. That's already very high. But I\nsaw 10,400 immediately pop up over Lord\nEaglerest head. We can't kill this maid\nanymore. I just realized that true\ndamage only works on Lord Eaglerest. The\nmaid has a giant protective shield\nprovided by Lord Eaglerest. No matter\nhow we attack, it'll be a miss. Another\ncalmer leader analyzed the problem.\nFocusing on Lord Eagle Crest is also\nmeaningless. That maid has terrifyingly\npowerful healing abilities. Dealing with\nboth of them together is an unsolvable\nproblem for us right now. They all\nbecame agitated. So, what do we do? The\nfemale leader said calmly, \"Wait for\ndeath.\" This short sentence was spoken\nquickly, but it silenced all her\nsubordinates. Perhaps they had all\naccepted their deaths. The female leader\nthought to herself, \"We can't kill Lord\nEaglerest. We can't break through Lawn\nDong City. Nor can we save St. Roy. The\nplayers will automatically respawn at\nthe nearby crystal. Once that giant\ncompletely shatters the crystal, players\ncan die and return to divine light town.\nSib holding Lori jumped on his Saken\nshoulder. They divided the attack\ndirections using flame emperor art to\nattack our maid. Were you today? Not a\nsingle one of you will escape. Sarakin,\nleave the last crystal. We'll camp and\nkill them. The noisy mob below realized\nit and quickly share the news. They want\nto camp our respawn point. Spread out\nquickly. If we get burned by that flame,\nwe're done for. Run out of the\nbattlefield. Run as far as you can. It's\nbetter than being killed and losing\nlevels. And so, thanks to their perfect\ncoordination. Wherever Sibbon and\nSarakan went, they were victorious. The\nones who had just been demanding to kill\nhim were now sent flying everywhere like\nplucked chickens. With Lorie by his\nside, Sibbon was like a kite in the\nwind. No matter how injured he got, he\nwas immediately restored to his original\nstate. The little girl also constantly\nencouraged him, \"Master, keep it up.\" on\nthe castle walls. Two strangers\nappeared, their faces completely\ncovered. The woman dressed as a nun\nlaughed, gleefully looking down at Sibon\nand Lorie. Truly disappointing. So many\npeople, and they still lost. It seems we\nstill need to take action. The man\nbehind her reminded her, \"We are all\nclear on his trump card. It's just that\nthe subhuman maid with extremely strong\nhealing and defensive abilities was not\nmentioned in the church's intelligence\nbefore. It seems she'll be a bit tough\nto handle. Hearing this, the woman\nsneered. So, there are things that the\nsword assassin deems tough to handle.\nIsn't your title one who can silently\napproach prey, ignore defenses, and kill\nthe opponent directly? With that, her\neyes blazed with killing intent. She\nrested a hand on the man's shoulder and\nwhispered, \"Remember, the Pope must. We\nare here to ensure he is killed, so this\nmission must not fail. He replied\ncurtly. Mm. Sibbin's enemies were now\ncountless. They were simply overwhelming\nhim with sheer numbers. For everyone\nSibbon killed, another took their place.\nWhile Sibbon was fighting at the front,\na man rushed in from behind, intending\nto launch a sneak attack on him. Lorie\nsaw it in time and shouted a warning,\n\"Master, be careful.\" But it was too\nlate. Lori took the blow for him and as\na result was stabbed in the chest. Blood\nflowed in a stream. Sibbin was stunned,\nonly able to utter the girl's name\nhelplessly. Lori, the masked man in\nblack, was momentarily surprised that\nLorie could withstand his attack. Sib\nbeside her was worried sick. Lori Lorie\nforced a smile to reassure him. It's\nnothing, master. Lorie previously\nreleased the Holy Spirit's blessing on\nherself, which is why I dare to block\nthe sword from master. He chided the\ngirl for her reckless action just now.\nEven so, that was too risky. The man in\nblack landed on the ground, immune to\ninstant death skills, huh? An\ninteresting subhuman young lady. Sibbon,\nwho had been enduring a hearttoppping\nscene, angrily shouted at him, \"How dare\nyou harm Lori?\" Just then, the system\ndisplayed this person's information. His\nname was Sissoka, a black sword\nsoulmaster. Identity: Elite Knight of\nthe Holy Land. Strength level 49\nassassin 41 to 50. Skills stealth pounce\nattack modified creature bleeding\nspikes. Modified creature flash step low\npresence modified creature hunting\nstance. Modified creature equipment\nbleeding black sword titles armor city\ngrandmaster county knight cologne empire\nprestige grandmaster 9673. Outwardly he\nis the second son of the lion clan.\nBehind the scenes, he is an elite knight\nof the Holy Land. Subhuman faction\nprestige 142. His hands were soaked in\nthe blood of subhumans. Sisssoka\nobserved him and concluded, \"An elite\nknight of the Holy Land. So, you're one\nof the church's people.\" Sibbin drew his\nsword, his eyes filled with killing\nintent, and growled at him word by word.\n\"I will make you regret this the moment\nyou die.\" With that, his fierce\ntiger-like power lunged at Sissoka, who\ncouldn't block in time. Such immense\nstrength. I didn't expect Lord Eagle\nCrest to go berserk over a subhuman\nmaid. His hand held his sword to defend,\nbut he couldn't resist this terrifying\npower. He reassessed the situation. If I\nface him head-on like this, I most\nlikely can't win. I have to find a\nchance to get behind him. He began to\nchange direction to circle behind, but\nthe quick-witted Sibbon had already\ndetected his intention. Trying to run?\nNot a chance. Sissoko was in a dilemma\nand called out for help from the other\nwoman. None. Aren't you going in hand?\nDo you want to watch me die? A turquoise\nspatial blade appeared as space tore\nopen. The blade shrank and moved towards\nSibbon, stabbing straight into his\nchest. Sibbon was caught off guard. When\nhe looked down, he saw blood seeping\nfrom his chest. It hurt so much. The\ntiny vortex burrowed deep into his\nchest. Unable to bear it, Sibbon spat\nout blood. Lorie was horrified. The girl\nquickly ran to Sibbon's side. Master.\nSibbon was tense. He hadn't thought such\na small spatial blade could bring him to\nthis state. The flesh and blood on his\nchest were instantly shredded to pieces\nby the spatial blade. I didn't expect\nthe Holy Land to have this kind of\ntalent. He collapsed onto the stone\nfloor. I was careless. Lorie ran to\nsupport him. Master, how are you? Lorie\nhugged him, placing her hand on the\nwound to heal him. Just half a minute.\nIn half a minute, Lorie will make you\nwell again. At this moment, the nun\nfinally revealed herself. She laughed\nsmugly. Quite something, aren't you? In\nthat case, I absolutely can't let you\nlive for another half a minute. She\nturned to mock Soka. However, seeing the\nblack sword in such a sorry state is\nactually quite interesting. Haha.\nSissoka, embarrassed, urged her to\nfinish the job. Stop wasting words and\ndeal with them. It's over. Lord\nEaglerest, Lorie, and Sibbon held each\nother. Could this be how it all ends?\nThe players who had been engrossed in\nthe slaughter now noticed something\nunusual. Hey, hey, isn't this a bit\nstrange? They stopped to gossip about\nthe two who were about to kill Sibbon.\nThose two who suddenly rushed and seemed\nto be people from the Holy Land. What\nthe hell? A cutscene suddenly started in\nthe middle of our Lawn Dong City assault\nmission. Is that even allowed? Another\nchimed in. The funniest part is them.\nThey wondered about this anomaly. We\nwere about to take down Lord Eagle Crest\nfor sure. Does this count as a story\nkill? If Lord Eagle Crest dies like\nthis, I wonder how the rewards will be\ncalculated. Sisssoka pointed his sword\nstraight at Sib and shouted, \"Die.\"\nLori, terrified, threw herself into\nSibbon's arms, crying loudly. \"Mom,\nmaster.\" Sibbin shielded her with one\narm. Lorie, get down. Sisssoka suddenly\nfroze. Countless sword slashes appeared\nfrom nowhere, cutting him several times.\nBefore he could react, he only managed\nto utter, \"Huh?\" before his body\ndisintegrated, torn to pieces. The nun\nbeside him was startled and horrified.\nBlack sword. Sibban looked into the\ndistance and recognized a familiar\nfigure. You are Roy. Roy with soulless\neyes advanced toward them, looking\nstraight at the nun. And you, the nun\nwas now afraid, her face darkening. How\ncan she have such terrifying speed?\nBlack sword was killed before he could\neven counterattack. She used her old\ntrick, pulling out the spatial blade.\nSibbon witnessed this scene again. This\nperson again. The nun underestimated\nRoyy's current combat ability. But this\nfox-eared girl has no battle aura to\nprotect her. As long as my space tears a\nlittle more, she will be instantly\nshattered. She didn't expect that\nalthough Roiy's body was weak, her\nreactions and abilities were still so\nstrong. Roy still didn't fly higher than\nthe nun's spatial blade, the nun\nremained calm. Damn it. This strange\nsubhuman mongrel's seven orphases have\nstarted to bleed. Her body is clearly\nbearing a heavy load. A huge one. I just\nneed to stall for a little longer and\nshe's sure to die. Got you. What?\nUnexpectedly, in the blink of an eye,\nRoy had circled behind her, tightly\ngripping the arm she was using to\nchannel her power. How? How can this be?\nMy spatial magic. Roy successfully took\nher down, constantly criticizing too\nslow, like a snail. On his side, Sibbon\ncouldn't believe his eyes. Are you\nkidding me? This is Roy. Roy held a\npiece of cloth in her hand and\nunconsciously said to herself, \"How\nbadly injured were you to be wrapped up\nlike this?\" Lorie gritted her teeth.\n\"Just a little. Just a little more.\" The\ngirl got out of Sibbon's arms and stood\nup, shielding him. Lorie shouted at Roy.\nI I won't let you harm Master. Sib tried\nto stop her. You fool Lorie. Regardless\nof what was happening, Roy rushed toward\nthem. She was about to attack. Sib\npulled Lorie into his arms, tried to\nblock Royy's blow with his sword. Roy\ncoughed out loud. Cough. Cough. cough.\nBlood also trickled from her mouth. Her\neyes crying tears of blood stared\nintently at Sibbon. Perhaps she had\nrecognized him. You are. She\nunconsciously fell against his chest and\npassed out. Hey Roy, everything happened\ntoo fast. Sibbin still didn't understand\nwhat was going on. What on earth is\nthis? Roy speed just now far surpassed\nnormal speeds. How'd she do that? Black\nstreams flowed from Royy's eyes and\nmouth. Sib seemed to have guessed what\nwas happening. Unless the system\ndisplayed Royy's information. Name Roy.\nIdi saintis personal strength. Subhuman.\nFirst stage awakening. Level 50. Skills\nlight and shadow prayer. Time freeze.\nSword of faith. Self-defense. Light. The\nfaster the speed, the heavier the load.\nBewitching fox scent. Passive charm.\nWeak limbs. Improved resilience.\nPassive. Equipment. Tattered stance\ndress. Normal cologne. Empire prestige.\n200. What reputation? Subhuman faction\nprestige 913. She is a kind-hearted\nsaint. Seeing Sibbin's silence, Lorie\nasked him, \"Master, are you all right?\"\nSib smiled gently. \"Don't worry, I'm\nfine.\" He looked at the menacing enemies\nbehind them. \"Besides, the war is about\nto end. The players are essentially a\nmob chasing experience and rewards.\nLet's go back. We can leave the rest to\nthose brutes.\" After speaking, he lifted\nLorie into his arms and slung Roy over\nhis other shoulder. Lorie worried\nbecause he was just injured. Wanted to\nwalk on her own. Master Lorie can walk\nby herself. Sibbon ignored her,\ninsisting on carrying her. Be quiet.\nSibbon reflected on the matter. With\nsuch a major incident occurring during\nthe mission, they couldn't just turn a\nblind eye and continue. The rowdy crowd\nthat was fighting suddenly stood still.\nHey, is that Roy? So ferocious. It seems\nso, but I can't be sure now. So, do we\nstill need to take her back to Divine\nLight Town? They discussed among\nthemselves. I see Lord Eagle Crest is\ninjured. Maybe we should just give up.\nNot only did this Holy Land thing\nsuddenly happen. Didn't she just save\nLord Eagle Crest? Is she a boss or a\nside quest? We need to figure it out or\nit's a waste of time and effort. We\nfought two nightmare gray bosses and got\nno drops at all. Let's go. Let's go.\nGrab the crystals. Respawn. Let's just\nsuicide run out of here. I don't want to\nstay here another day. Sib, Lori, and\nRoy returned to the castle. Sib placed\nRoy on the bed. Lorie healed Royy's\nwounds. Master, all her internal organs\nare injured. Lori can treat the wounds\non her body, but there's no way to heal\nher torn soul. For now, this can only\nrecover on its own. She'll be quite weak\nfor a very long time. He noticed the\ngirl seemed uneasy and reassured her,\n\"You did a great job. You should go get\nsome rest.\" Sib was alone in the room,\ncontemplating the past events. As\nexpected, Roy has awakened her personal\nbloodline power. Perhaps she couldn't\ndistinguish between dreams and reality,\nwhich is why she indiscriminately\nattacked friend and foe and went on a\nkilling spree after waking up. Sibbon\nsides sympathetically as the female\nprotagonist bearing such a heavy\nresponsibility is truly not easy. But\nher body can't handle the power that\ncomes with her speed. So she unleashes\nher full power like today. Her body and\nsoul are being torn apart every second.\nThe players were still loitering at the\nplace where the fierce battle had just\ntaken place. They wondered, \"I wonder\nhow the male protagonist is doing. Damn\nit.\" The people from Divine Light Town\nfinally made it back. Someone who had\nbeen beaten down to level zero lamented,\n\"I want to quit the game, brothers. I'm\ngoing to become an oddest. This game has\nnothing. You're supposed to pick up\nrewards, but the important thing is we\ndidn't pick up a damn thing.\" I feel\nlike we're about to lose our starter\nvillage, too. The players blamed Yihow.\nAnd the protagonist, Yihow, is also too\nterrible. Who knows where he ran off to\nthis time? He's useless here anyway.\nJust losing, losing, losing, losing,\nlosing. A voice echoed from somewhere.\nYehow, you have failed again. He asked\nthe figure of fire in front of him. Can\nI ask you something? Seeing the fire\nfigure remain silent. He knelt on one\nknee. Why was it that when Lord Eagleest\nfirst came to me, he could have\ncompletely killed us, but didn't? Only\nthen did the fire figure speak. I'm\ntrying to understand the power of this\nworld. Isn't can also try and understand\nmy power. He and I are both absorbing\nthe unique rules of each other. Yehow\ngradually understood everything. So the\nreason Lord Eaglerest didn't completely\nkill me and the players was because he\nintentionally wanted to maintain contact\nwith the players to help the existence\nbehind him learn about the Latin world.\nIn that case, Lord Eagler Crest and I\nare just chess pieces for two world\nwills with the cane continent as the\nchessboard. The help the Laddin will\ngave me is the players. The help the\ncamel gave Lord Eagle Crest is those\nstrange monster soldiers. The mysterious\nfire person reminded him. The battle\nbetween worlds is extremely perilous. I\nam not omnisient and omnipotent in this\nworld. So you cannot continue to be\nreckless. You were the one who told me\nto attack Lawn Dong City, and now you're\nthe one blaming me for being reckless,\nand I'm supposed to be the child of\ndestiny. Might as well change my name to\nthe child of disaster. He raised the\nhand holding the globe like object. I\nhave deciphered some of this world's\nrules and can stably provide some help.\nFrom now on, you must rely on yourself.\nTime is running out. If you fail again,\nyou should know your fate, right? Yeha\ncould only obediently obey him. Yes. In\nthe sky, a woman appeared in midair. her\nvoice echoing down. Esteemed heroes from\nanother world. I'm a subhuman goddess,\nMal Long man. I know of the setbacks you\nhave experienced in London City. The\ncrowd began to murmur. Hey, look. It's a\ngoddess. He a goddess. What's this? A\nnew story line? Holy crap, brothers. I\ncan get behind this. This is a cut\nscene. The devs are really going all\nout. A few perverts even joked, \"He that\ngenerous bosom, that graceful waist,\nthose long smooth legs, that thin\nsee-through chiffon skirt. I'm ready.\"\nThe subhuman goddess my long men\ncontinued, \"This is not your fault.\"\nLord Eagle Crest power and cunning were\nbeyond the data. But you cannot just\ngive up. My pitiful servant, that saints\nstill needs your help. The girls\nstanding among the players understood.\nSo the Lawn Dawn City instance will be\nforcibly modified. The subhuman goddess\nencouraged them. Brave warriors, you\nstill have a chance. It's just that your\ncurrent strength is still weak and you\nmust temporarily avoid the storm. Head\nwest, brave warriors. Leave Lord Eagle\nCrest's territory. You will eventually\nsoar high. I will be in the shackles of\nthe gods. Using this remnant of mine to\npray for you. Quest update completed.\nOriginal main quest. Restore the empire\nhas been personally modified to required\nlevel 40 plus. Side quest updated. Epic\ngrade. A long journey. Quest\ndescription.

Lorie, in a cute and\npleading tone, begged her master not to\nbe angry anymore. She knew she was\nwrong. At this moment, Lorie was sitting\nwith her knees drawn up in Sib's lap. He\nsnorted and warned her, \"Let's see if\nyou dare to block a sword again next\ntime.\" Lorie blushed shily, closed her\neyes, and placed her hands on Sibbon's\nshoulders. Lorie lowered her head, her\nmind in a jumble, wondering why her\nmaster had asked her to kneel on his\nlap. This way, her knees didn't hurt,\nbut it was so embarrassing. These\nthoughts made Lorie feel shy. Lorie's\neyes looked up at Sib's face, a proud\nsmile on her lips as she silently\nadmired him. \"Master is so handsome. Our\nchildren will surely be extremely cute,\nright? But will they have ears and a\ntail like me?\" Sib saw Lorie looking at\nhim and turned his face away as he still\nhadn't figured out how to punish her. At\nthat moment, Lorie suddenly opened her\nmouth and called out, \"Master.\" her. Her\nlips were slightly seductive as she said\nshe wanted to be with her master,\nprobably intending to say she wanted to\nhave children with him, but she was cut\noff by Sib before she could finish.\nFlustered, he ran a hand through his\nhair and said loudly, \"What children?\nIt's broad daylight.\" The sudden\nembarrassment made Sibbon forget all his\nserious thoughts about reprimanding her,\nand the idea of a severe punishment\nvanished. Lorie spread her arms and\nthrew herself at her master, hugging him\ntightly. Sibbon, now embarrassed, didn't\nknow what to do and could only hold his\narms wide. Lorie's chest pressed against\nSibbon's body. She closed her eyes and\ntilted her face up to kiss Sib, who\ncried out in a fluster. While fumbling\nawkwardly, Sibbon's hand touched Lor's\nsoft brown tail. Lorie immediately let\nout a soft moan. Being touched on the\ntail caused Lorie to react. Her eyes\nbecame hazy, her arms went limp, her\nmouth opened wide, and her chest heaved.\nLorie then said to Sibbon, \"You can't\njust touch a subhuman's tail.\" Lorie's\nknees instinctively drew up. After all,\nthat's a place only a husband can touch.\nIf you touch it, you have to take\nresponsibility. At this moment, Sibbon\nsuddenly had an idea. Now, he knew how\nto punish Lorie. He smiled brightly and\nraised his hand. Sib continuously\ntouched and stroked Lor's tail again and\nagain, asking her while stroking her\ntail if she would dare to do it again,\nanymore. Lorie immediately felt she\ncouldn't take it anymore. Her chest\nheaved, her head tilted back, her face\nflushed, and sweat began to pour down.\nIn a seductive manner, Lorie begged, \"I\nwon't dare.\" Sibbon let go, and Lorie\nimmediately hugged his arm, looking like\na puppy as she said she knew she was\nwrong, apologized to her master, and\neven had a gift for Sibbon. Sibbon now\nsmiled triumphantly. Lorie opened her\nhand. Inside was a four-leaf clover\nbracelet. She explained that in her\nhomeland, the four-leaf clover is a\nsymbol of luck. wearing it would make\nher master luckier and luckier. The\nfour-leaf clover shone with a strange\ngolden light. Sibbon asked if it was\nmade from the bottle of life water he\nhad used to heal Lorie before. Sibon\ntook the bracelet and held it up to\ninspect it, then continued, \"I thought\nyou threw that bottle away a long time\nago.\" Lorie said huffily that it was the\nfirst gift her master had given her,\nfull of symbolic meaning. So, how could\nshe throw it away? After hearing this,\nSibbon became a little curious. Seeing a\nthree-leaf clover necklace around\nLorie's neck, he asked what the\nthree-leaf clover on her neck\nsymbolized. Lorie looked down shily, a\ngentle smile on her lips, and said\nsoftly, \"I won't tell you about this\nthree-leaf clover, master.\" Then she ran\nout the door, turned back to wave at\nSib, and said with a smile, \"You'll have\nto guess, master. I have to go to Miss\nChris's class now.\" Leaving a still\nbewildered Sibbon behind. Sibbon\nrelaxed, leaning back in his chair with\nhis hands behind his head and his feet\npropped up on the desk. He smiled and\nasked the system, \"This time, I repelled\nthe players and modified the\npredetermined fate. There should be a\nreward, right? The system hasn't popped\nup recently. I wonder what it's been\ndoing.\" The system immediately\nannounced, \"Death story line completed.\nReceived one chain of fate. The child of\ndestiny, Yeihow, currently has two fate\nlines remaining. The host can use it at\nany time.\" Sibbin was confused. Sibbons\nsaid, \"Speak of the devil and he shall\nappear.\" I was just thinking about the\nsystem and it popped right up. One chain\nof fate that can be used at any time.\nSystem: Does it matter when I use it?\nSibbon asked the system after receiving\nthe notification, focusing on the\nsystems information panel in front of\nhim. The system replied, suggesting it\ncould be used during battle to make the\nchild of Destiny uncomfortable. This\ninformation made Sibbon wonder.\nUncomfortable? How uncomfortable? the\nsystem replied very uncomfortable.\nSibbon was left speechless. Tired of\ntalking to the system, he brushed his\nhair back and thought, \"I'm not wasting\nany more words on this stupid system. If\nI keep talking, I'm afraid my IQ will be\ndragged down by it.\" He requested to\ndraw his reward. After hearing Sibbon's\nrequest, the system displayed a\nnotification. Host has completed the\ndaily villain quest. Beginning reward\ndraw. Sibbon's reward was an equipment\nreward. No critical bonus this time. The\nsystem congratulated the host on\nreceiving the special hero grade\nequipment, the holy robe of Vina. Sibbon\nstood there scratching his head in\nconfusion. The holy robe of Vina. Why\ndoes that name sound like something a\nwoman would wear? Sib tapped on the\nclothing icon on the system screen.\nSystem. Suddenly, the system exploded\nwith a loud noise and a dazzling golden\nlight enveloped the area, forcing Sibbon\nto cover his eyes with his hands. At\nthis moment, the system explained, \"The\nholy robe of Vina is a holy garment\npersonally crafted by the goddess of\nbeauty, Vina. There are only three sets\non the entire Cain continent. One set is\ncurrently known to be in the possession\nof the elf princess. Skill, blessing of\ndustlessness, passive skill, charm\nincrease, passive. Skill as the heart\ndesires, skill, advanced natural grace,\npassive, a black outfit shrouded in\ngolden light appeared before Sibbon.\"\nSibbon looked at the outfit and\nremarked, \"The name already sounded like\nit, and looking at it, it looks even\nmore so.\" But Sibbon still didn't\nunderstand what is the heart desires\nmeant. So, he asked the system. The\nsystem responded, \"That skill allows it\nto transform into any shape the host and\nthe owner desire.\" The transformation\ncan occur just by imagining it in your\nmind. The holy robe of Venina is also\nknown as the goddess of beauty's\nwardrobe. Sibbon thought deeply. It\ncould transform into any shape.\nCountless images of Lori appeared in his\nmind. Lori in a cool bikini. Lori in a\ncute school uniform. Lori in a seductive\nshort top. Sibbon's face couldn't hide\nhis craving. Sibbon raised a hand to\nscratch his nose and said shamelessly,\n\"Let's try the saintest outfit, too.\"\nLost in thought, he was cut off by the\nsystems prompt. \"Host, it has appeared.\"\nSibbin angrily yelled the system, \"What\nthe hell are you rushing me for? Instead\nof making it appear, can't you just toss\nit over to Mimi's place and turn it into\ntwo for me? This system is driving me\ncrazy. Sibon took the reward outfit in\nhis hand. It felt smooth and cool to the\ntouch. Wearing her grade equipment like\nthis must be very comfortable. I\nprobably won't even need to wear\nunderwear. Huh? Sibbon exclaimed in\nadmiration. An image of Lorie's body in\na seductive, tight-fitting black\nlingerie set, her arms open wide for\nSibbon, appeared in his mind. Just the\nthought of it made Sibbon's nose bleed\nwith pleasure. During the day, the holy\nrobe of Vina will turn into a maid\ndress. At night, well, whatever. I'm not\ntalking anymore. I'm going to take a\nbath. In a quiet room, a young girl was\nsound asleep on a luxurious bed. The\ngirl opened her eyes drowsily and\nwondered, \"Where is this?\" Roy gently\nplaced her feet on the ground. She\nwalked around, looking at her\nsurroundings, not knowing if this was a\ndream or reality. But she had never\ndreamed of a place decorated like this\nbefore. Roy pushed the door with her\nhand and the large, exquisitly carved\ndoor creaked open. She wondered if this\ndoor was the way out of the dream. Roy\nstepped inside. Inside, Sibbon had just\nfinished showering with only a towel\nwrapped around his waist. As he was\nraising his hand to dry his hair, he\nsuddenly saw a girl with white hair. Her\nsmall ears and tail were also white. The\ngirl was wearing a kneelength dress with\ndeep form-fitting cuts. Both of them\nwere surprised. Roy was deeply shocked,\npointed at Sibbon, and shouted, \"A naked\nperson. Why would something so perverted\nappear in her dream? And why is it Lord\nEagle Crest?\" Finishing her words, Roy\nimmediately turned away, covering her\nflustered face with both hands. Her face\nflushed red as she thought, \"Even so, I\ncan't deny he has a really nice body.\"\nStanding before the flustered Roy, Sib\nheld the towel wrapped around his waist\nand asked with a smile, \"You're awake?\"\nImmediately, Roy held her hands out in\nfront of her, shut her eyes tightly, and\nsaid loudly, \"Her highness, the subhuman\nsist Roy will not be afraid of this\nnightmare creature.\" Royy's reaction\nleft Sibbon stunned. Roy lunged at\nSibbon and hugged him tightly. Sibbon\nalmost fell backward. She used all her\nstrength to bite Sibbon, making him cry\nout in pain. He had to tell Roy to stop,\neven asking if she was born in the year\nof the dog. Unable to bear the pain,\nSibbon tightly gripped Roiy's hands and\npinned her to the floor. He told her to\nsnap out of it, that this was the real\nworld, not a dreamscape. Roy stared\nintently at Sibbon and said she didn't\nbelieve him, that all the liars in\ndreamscapes say this is the real world.\nAt this moment, Sibbon leaned in close\nto Roy, whose face turned crimson. To\nprove his words, Sibbon bitter Roy in\npain grimaced and screamed. she thought.\nSo everything is happening for real, not\nreal. Then what just happened was so\nembarrassing. A hint of confusion\nflashed in her eyes, her face still\nblushing with shyness. Sibbin looked at\nRoy lying on the floor and asked, \"Do\nyou believe me now?\" Roy with a pouting\nface, looked away in another direction.\nJust then, the system notified Sibbin,\n\"Posttory mission, abduct the saintest,\nhumiliate the saintest has been\nunlocked. Upon completion, you could\nparticipate in one prize draw. Host,\nplease complete it soon. After hearing\nthis, a sly smile appeared on Sibbon's\nface. He thought, \"Humiliate the saints?\nAren't I already doing that? The system\nreally gets me.\" Sibbon immediately\nreached out and squeezed Roiy's chest\nhard. She was startled, then swung her\nhand and slapped Sibbon hard across the\nface. The five-finger mark imprinted on\nhis face made Sibbon hurt and cry out.\nRoy covered her chest with her hands,\nher face annoyed as she called Sibbon a\npervert. At that moment, Lorie arrived\nwith water for her master. Arriving at\nthe door, she heard a strange sound and\nwondered what it was coming from her\nmaster's room. Lorie was worried and\nasked, \"Master, are you in there? I'm\ncoming.\" In the call from outside the\ndoor made Sibbon freeze his hand in\nfront of Royy's chest. Sib looked at the\ndoor in a panic, realizing with some\nalarm that Lorie was outside. Roy was\nalso surprised. Lorie pushed the door\nopen and entered, telling Sibbon that\nsince Miss Chris wasn't there today, she\ncame back a little early. Seeing Sibbon\njust standing there, Lorie asked him,\n\"Why are you standing there like a\nfool?\" Sib blinked, and seeing that Roy\nwas gone, he was bewildered. Lorie\nclosed her eyes and sniffed the air. The\nlittle girl smiled and asked Sibbon,\n\"Have you been alone in the room this\nwhole time?\" She was still holding the\nplate of food she brought for her\nmaster. Sibbon quickly raised a hand to\nscratch his head and explained Roy was\njust here. It's just that her state was\na bit strange. Maybe she couldn't\ndistinguish between reality and a\ndreamscape, but she has probably gone\nback to her room by. Not now. Outside,\nbirds soared in the clear blue sky. The\nmagnificent castle stood silently on its\nvast grounds. A small bird perched on\nthe windowsill, intently peering around.\nIt turned out that outside the window,\nRoy was pressed against a narrow ledge.\nher back flat against the wall,\ncarefully balancing. Her eyes were shut\ntight in fear. The small bird flew past\nand Roy exclaimed in fear, \"This is way\ntoo high.\" Tears welled up in her eyes\nand she gripped tightly with both hands\nto keep her body balanced. Lorie placed\ntwo glasses of water on Sib's table and\nsaid, \"Master, look.\" Lorie gently\ntouched her dress. \"The gift you gave\nme, master, it's so comfortable to\nwear.\" Sibbon's eyes crinkled with\ndelight. Of course, it's herograde\nequipment. It's extremely comfortable to\nwear and it can also transform into\ndifferent types of clothing. For\nexample, your maid dress. It also has\nother functions like being dust\nrepellent, naturally elegant, and it can\neven increase your charm. Wearing it,\nyou're definitely the most beautiful\nsubhuman girl. Lorie smiled brightly as\nthe outfit gradually transformed into a\ndifferent dress. Really, are you\npleased? Of course, it's true. Our Lorie\nis the best. Lorie recalled Chris's\nwords. Increase your charm. Then it will\nbe easy to get Master to have a baby\nwith me. Now is the time to strike while\nthe iron is hot. She had a realization.\nI understand, Miss Chris. Lorie suddenly\nlay prone on the table. Master. Sib gave\na clueless smile. What is it from\nSibbon's perspective? He could see the\nlittle girl's bare back and charming\nbottom. Lorie shily asked him, \"This\nbackless sweater, do I look good in it?\"\nWithout thinking, Sibbon immediately\nreplied, \"Extremely beautiful.\" Lorie\nsaid, \"Dearly, master. Lori listened to\nyou and has been obediently drinking\nmilk every day.\" Sibbin covered his\nmouth with one hand to hide his smile\nwhile patting the little girl's head\nwith the other. \"Is that so?\" Lori is so\ngood. Lorie hesitated. \"Yes, so point.\"\nOne day, Lori will definitely become as\nvoluuptuous as Miss Chris. So, master\nhas to wait for me. He gently pinched\nLor's cheek. Ouch. Lorie is already\ncharming enough as she is. Lorie then\ngot to the main point, so having a baby.\nMentioning this topic felt like a huge\nrock had been dropped on Sibbon's head.\nWe still have to wait. Wait until after\nyour birthday. Next time for sure. Lorie\nwas reluctantly made to lie on the bed.\nBut Lorie wants to. Sibbon tucked the\nlittle girl in. No, you don't want to.\nIt's very late. Go to sleep now. Sibbon\nwiped the sweat from his forehead. Jeez,\nfor real? Lorie's behavior is getting\nmore and more dangerous. What if I\nreally can't hold back? Lorie mumbled in\nher sleep on the bed. He master have a\nbaby. Sib screamed internally. Not now.\nAt this rate, I won't be able to sleep.\nI'll go get some cold air. There are\nstill many things to consider. The\nchanges from the dragon blood potion to\nmy body have. That begun to emerge. The\nskill's duration is too long while the\ncool down is too short. It hasn't been\nlong and the skill has already\nrefreshed. Just as he stepped outside,\nhe saw Roy standing still for so long\nthat she was about to freeze into a\nmoving ice block. Sib cried out an\nalarm. Roy, what are you doing? Surely\nyou haven't been standing here all\nnight. Roy was sobbing. Ho, it's so\ncold. She climbed onto the ledge,\nholding out a hand for Sibbon to support\nher. I had no choice. There's no way to\ngo from here, but there is a way. You\npeople just wouldn't leave. Sibbon chedd\nher. It's so late at night. What were\nyou doing leaving your bedroom? Sibbon\nblamed himself, \"But I really did forget\nshe was still here.\" \"Geez, you're\nfreezing cold.\" Sibbon put his arm\naround her waist to support her. Sib\ninstructed Roy, \"Your body hasn't\nrecovered yet. Hurry back to your room,\ntake a bath, and go to sleep. We can\ntalk about whatever it is tomorrow.\" In\nhis arms, Royy's cheeks flushed pink, so\nwarm. A guard from outside burst through\nthe door to report, \"My lord, a secret\nmessage from the royal capital.\" As soon\nas he entered, he saw the scene of\nSibbon holding Roy and froze at the\ndoor, struggling to get out the last\nword, the message. Sibbin angrily chased\nhim out. Get out now. The result for the\nperson who barged into Sibbon's room to\nreport was being punished by kneeling on\nboth knees, holding a great sword. He\nwas crying silently, Sibbon shouted,\nmaking him jump, \"That's enough. Be\nquiet.\" He put a hand to his forehead\nand sighed. \"Really? Why was I so\nthoughtless as to bring this\ntroublemaker back?\" Roy thought to\nherself. Why did he drag me here? I\nmissed the chance to ask. Lorie frowned,\nlooking at the person next to her. Why\nis she here? Isn't she an outsider? Sib\nasked seriously. Back to the matter at\nhand. Aluny, why are you here? You look\na mess. Alency replied respectfully,\n\"Young Master Sibbon, the king is about\nto die. The Pope is plotting a rebellion\nto take advantage of the situation. The\nroyal capital has been surrounded by the\nchurch's army, and the Duke has also\nbeen trapped in the capital.\" Sib asked\nan alarm. What? Aluni elaborated within\na short week using some unknown means\nthey successfively killed many sky\nknights who controlled the royal army.\nNow the king's military system is in a\nstate of semiparalysis. Also young\nmaster Sibbon your elder brother Count\nHitler the golden lion has taken refuge\nwith the church and with the pope's help\nhas completely seized the duke's assets.\nSib froze upon hearing this news. The\nother person continued, \"He even wants\nto launch a surprise attack on Eagle\nCrest to kill you and eliminate the\nthreat for good. It wasn't easy for me\nto escape from the Duke's territory.\"\nStanding behind Sibbon, Lorie was\nindignant. That's outrageous. They\nactually want to harm Master. Sibained\ncalm. Don't worry, it's not that easy.\nHowever, he still felt uneasy, but it's\nstrange. He thought to himself, \"Did my\ndear brother get his head caught in a\ndoor attacking Eagle Crest, this\ngodforsaken place? Besides the chance to\nrun into some beastmen brothers, what\nelse is there? Why attack Eagle Crest?\nThere are quite a few subhumans here. He\nsuddenly realized he received help from\nthe church. That's right. It might\nreally be because of the subhumans. No\nwonder people from the church attacked\nme time and again before. I thought it\nwas because I had messed with their\npeople and they came for revenge. Turns\nout there was another reason. In that\ncase, isn't my situation actually very\ndangerous? I can't believe I just barely\nescaped the player's mess only to be\ngreeted by the Pope's rebellion system.\nWhy don't you just put me out of my\nmisery? Seeing Sibbin remained silent,\nAlansy continued, \"Young master, this is\na letter from Marquee Calandi to all the\nlords. A secret letter? You're tossing\nit around too casually.\" Aluni knew,\n\"It's fine. A normal person wouldn't be\nable to read it anyway.\" Indeed, the\nhandwriting on the paper was like a cat\nscratch. Sibbon looked helplessly at the\npaper. Is this a dog's chew toy? On the\nother hand, it's very much in the style\nof a simple-minded, brrawy first prince.\nThe three of them stared at the letter,\nnot understanding anything. After a\nmoment, Roy realized, \"I think this way\nis correct.\" The letter read as follows.\nThe royal capital is about to fall into\nenemy hands. I, representing the will of\nthe first prince, invite all lords to\nAsh Rock Ridge to participate in a\nroundt conference. Together, we will\ndiscuss an alliance to deal with the\npope. I hope all of you understand the\nurgency of matter. The first prince and\nI will wait at Ashrock Ridge for 5 days.\nThe fall of the royal capital is only\nthe beginning. The church's holy knights\nwill sooner or later step into your\nterritories. Sib held the letter and\ngave a force smile. This threatening\nletter basically has only one meaning.\nThe first prince is going to war. Are\nyou coming to help or not? If you don't\ncome, you'll face the consequences when\nyou get attacked later. Not yourself.\nAlency asked for Sibbon's opinion. So,\nare we going or not? Sibbon analyzed\nclearly, we definitely have to go. Not\nbecause of the threat from that\nwararmonger, Calani, nor does it have\nanything to do with the first prince,\nbut because the enemy of my enemy is my\nfriend. We have a common enemy. The\npaper floated to the ground. Sibbin\ncontinued, \"Seriously, the church of\nBana.\" Roy stood nearby, thinking to\nherself, \"Is it okay for me to hear\nthis?\" A servant reported, \"Young Master\nSibbon, this is some information I\nobtained from a detective in the royal\ncapital. It's related to the church and\nalso related to the subhumans.\" Roy was\nalarmed. This matter, it's actually\nrelated to the subhumans. She hurtly\nasked Sibbon, \"What is the news?\" Sibbin\ncalmed her. \"Don't be anxious. Let me\ntake a look.\" On the paper was a clear\ntitle, Paradise Plan. Inside a certain\ncastle, a loud cry echoed. What? What on\nearth are you people doing? Let go. That\ncry for help belonged to a subhuman\nwhose hands were bound by two priests\nbeing escorted somewhere with a man\nleading the way in front. The female\nsubhuman was led to an iron room, the\noutside of which was covered by a large\nwhite cloth. The woman pleaded\ncontinuously, \"Don't don't kill me. I\nbeg you.\" Regardless of her please, the\ngroup of priests still threw her into\nthe room. The subhuman, thrown in\nunexpectedly, screamed loudly. Ah, they\nwarned her, \"Don't make a noise. get in.\nThe subhuman saw something, her eyes\nwidening in trembling fear. In front of\nher were many other subhumans sticking\nout their tongues and looking at her\ngreedily. Their eyes glowed bright red\njust like vultures waiting for their\nprey. Next, only the piercing scream of\nthe subhuman was heard as before. She\nscreamed continuously, \"Don't don't come\nhere. Get away, Arg.\" The ones who\nescorted her didn't pay any attention,\nacting calmly as if this wasn't the\nfirst time they had done this. This\nfemale subhuman slave is lucky this\ntime. When it was over, the corpse of\nthat subhuman was thrown onto the pile\nof other subhuman corpses. The two\npriests, having finished their work,\ncalmly stepped out from that pile of\ncorpses. Wherever their feet went, red\nbloody footprints were imprinted on the\nfloor. It's true. She's basically\nconsidered intact, not torn to shreds by\nthat drugged up crazy mob. On Sibbon's\nside, they were still tensely discussing\nthe matter. Young Master Sibbon,\naccording to the information you gave me\nbefore, I thought the church produced\nTemplar Knights through the fresh blood\nof young female subhumans. Having gotten\na taste for it, Alansy spoke seriously\nabout this issue. But it seems because\nthe conversion rate is quite low, they\nnow intend to start researching the\nsubhumans themselves, including\ngenetics. Sibbin cursed inwardly. Damn\nit. I thought that underground level was\nalready the limit. I didn't expect the\nchurch's insane ambition to once again\nredefine my understanding. Roy asked,\n\"Wait a minute. You mean they use the\nblood of subhumans to create temper\nknights? How can that be?\" Lorie\nwhispered into Sibbon's ear, \"Master, is\nthis true?\" Lorie is so scared. Sib\nreassured her. Don't be afraid. I won't\nlet this kind of thing happen in my\nterritory. Yes, master. With that said,\nLorie shook Aluny's arm. First, I'll\ntake a Luny to rest, and I'll take care\nof him while I'm at it. Sibbon pondered.\nSo, my elder brother Hitler wants to\nattack Eagle Crest. Not because he's\nbrainless, but more than half of the\nreason is the Pope's orders. Perhaps the\ndamn lord from my past life also hunted\nsubhumans everywhere because of the\npope's orders with his own desires being\nonly part of the reason. While lost in\nthought, the system suddenly appeared.\nHost has activated stage for mission.\nCapture female subhuman slaves. Promote\nthe subhuman slavery convention. Ding.\nSaint is Roy detected to be alive. ZT\nzzt mission is changing. ZZT. Thus,\nding. Host only needs to complete the\ncapture of over 100 female subhuman\nslaves. This mission is a death plot.\nHost, please be prepared. Siban looked\ntowards Roy full of worry. The system\nstory mission actually changed and it\nwas because of Roy, but not needing to\npromote the subhuman slavery convention.\nThat's a good thing. What's left is\ncapturing female subhuman slaves. By\nnow, the paradise plan must have already\nspread. I'm afraid that more and more\nsubhumans hiding in the shadows will\nflee to East Grave Town at times like\nthese. If I follow the systems request\nto capture female subhuman slaves, I'll\njust become a great villain, the enemy\nof the subhumans in everyone's eyes. Who\nwould believe that the real demon is\nactually the church? Sibbon had a\nheadache lightly rubbing his temples. Is\nthis a return to the previous life? The\ncurrent saint is clearly here. It would\nbe great if Roy could convince the\nsubhumans to follow me directly. Those\nwho can awaken their abilities can just\nfind any job to make a living. Those who\ncan awaken their abilities can be\norganized into a special branch of\npower. The problem is that gayhow will\ndefinitely prevent things from\ndeveloping this way. Sai since this life\nis related to the church and the mission\nbelongs to the system, then it must also\nbe related to Yeihow, right? Yho is in\nthis. What role do I have to play this\ntime? While drifting in his own\nthoughts, someone suddenly called his\nname loudly, startling him. Lord Eagle\nCrest. He answered instinctively, \"Huh,\nRoy, you should go rest, too. I still\nhave things to do. I can't sleep with\nyou tonight.\" Roy blushed. Who was\ntalking about that? What do you mean by\ntonight? Roy leaned in close to ask\nSibbon. You just said you wouldn't let\nthis kind of thing happen in your\nterritory, right? Sib nodded. Yes, I\nsaid that. Why? Roy suddenly knelt down.\nI beg you, save the subhumans. If you\ncan save them, I am willing to do\nanything for you. Sib glanced over at\nher, smiling faintly. Really, anything\nat all? He moved closer to Roy. How\nabout this? Roy was flustered. You? She\nthought to herself. Could it be that he\nwants me to offer myself to him? Roy\nsuddenly shot up, causing her head to\nhit Sib's jaw. Wait, wait, let me think\nabout it. Sib, whose chin was hit\nunexpectedly, cried out, \"Ouch.\" Sib got\na nose bleed and glared at her. Uggh.\nWhat are you doing? I just wanted to say\nthat after this is successful. I want\nyou to become my maid. Roy froze. A\nmaid. She knelled down. I'm I'm sorry.\nHow about I help you stop the bleeding?\nAt the mayor's residence in Divine Light\nTown, Yiha was standing before his desk\nwhen he heard the sound of footsteps\napproaching from behind. He raised his\nsword wearily. Who? The one approaching\nwas the succubus. She licked her finger.\nYour excellency Yeihow looking so fierce\nand brandishing your sword like that.\nYou're making Lil Sea a bit scared, you\nknow. Ei looked at her defensively. I've\nnever invited a guest like you. I invite\nyou to get off my territory. He thought\nto himself, I was horribly screwed over\nby a demon last time. I can't believe\nthis still dares to come find me.\nEven if you're going to fleece a sheep,\nyou should at least find a different one\nto fleece. She writhed. Ooh ooh my my.\nWhen you first summon me, you even call\nme little CIA. Now you're being so rude.\nYou're breaking my heart. Eh watched her\nwythe helplessly. That's because last\ntime I didn't know your filthy nature.\nYou even screwed over the human you were\ncooperating with. She calmly sat on the\nchair and crossed her legs. We demons\nnaturally don't need to follow any rules\nwhen dealing with humanity. But your\nexcellency yehow, you are now a half\ndemon. You have the qualifications to\nmake a fair deal with us. His sore spot\nhaving been touched. He drove her away.\nI don't want to make a deal with you.\nGet lost. She remained shameless. We are\nvery sincere this time. Your excellency\nYiha. You can consider it for a bit\nbefore you speak. She waved her hand and\na purple light emanated from her palm\nforming a small array on the table. This\nis a peak master grade long sword. If\nnot for a few side effects in terms of\npower, even a herogra weapon would not\nsurpass it. If your excellency yehow\nagrees to cooperate with us, this long\nsword will be yours. And and if you want\nCIA, Lord Finton will also agree. The\nsystem screen displayed demon sword\nbattrade\ndemon sword. After being filled with\ndemonic energy, it is incredibly sharp.\nIt can combat aura and magic shields to\na certain extent and has an extremely\nstrong suppressive effect against light\ntype protection skills. Note, once Bio\nQueen is bound to its owner, it must\nconsume one pure soul every seven days,\notherwise it will devour the owner's\nsoul. as food. E-how calculated, I\nhaven't had any breakthroughs in my\nskills recently, and I only have a\nstupid set of grandmaster grade\nequipment. I lack a weapon that matches\nmy strength. This thing is good, and the\nside effects are acceptable. A soul,\nhuh? I could just find some wild beast\nand kill it. Even if there are some\nrequirements for the soul, even if it\nmeans killing people, that's acceptable.\nAfter all, he is an intruder with no\nconnection to this world. Finally, he\nagreed to the deal. This thing isn't\nbad. What do you guys want? Cia smiled\nsmugly. Very simple. She moved closer to\nYeihow using your current prestige among\nthe subhuman race. We need you to\nperiodically deliver subhumans into the\nabyss teleportation array. Yeihow laid\ndown to let Caes sit on his stomach, but\nhis mouth still asked, \"You demons can\ntravel back and forth in the human\nworld. Why don't you do this kind of\nthing yourselves?\" The succubus replied\nwith a flirtatious expression, \"We can\ntravel in the material plane, but our\nstrength will be weakened. and if we\nhappen to encounter a judge from the\nChurch of Light, then we'd be finished.\nHe sat up straight, hugging Sea. But\nwhat's the use of you capturing\nsubhumans who can't even trust a\nchicken? She leaned close to Yeihow's\near. I suppose I can tell you this.\nCoincidentally, Lord Finton discovered\nthe existence of a powerful ancient\ndivinity on the bodies of subhumans. And\nit's absolutely not the low-level\ndivinity of a wild god. It's just that\nthe amount of divinity on different\nsubhumans varies. He wondered divinity.\nThat's right. The subhuman named Roy\nfrom last time had very strong divinity\non her. Lord Fenton originally wanted to\nperfectly devour this divinity to\nenhance his own strength. Unfortunately,\nhe still failed in the end. So now Lord\nFinton can only capture more subhumans\nand take the divinity in their bodies as\na substitute. Yeihow gave a cunning\nsmile. So that's how it is. This\ncooperation, I agree, but the conditions\naren't enough. You have to add more. CIA\nbreathed hotly onto Yihow's face. \"What\nmore do you want? How about CIA serves\nyou?\" Yiha suddenly pushed her off of\nhim. \"Do you think I'm still someone who\ncan be easily seduced now? Save your\nservice for your master Fenton.\" Pushed\naway unexpectedly. She yelled in Yiha's\nface. \"You actually,\" Yihow glared, \"My\ncondition is, give me a squad of horn\ndemon overseers. I need more power to\nattack the Beastman tribe.\" On the\nstreets, many flyers were scattered with\nthe title Subhuman Park, a place\nproviding unlimited fun for fellow\nsubhumans. Unlimited. A certain subhuman\nfinished reading the flyer and looked\nleft and right. This female subhuman\nasked a passer by. Hello everyone, I'm\nShiao. This gentleman, do you know where\nSubhuman Park is? Subhuman Park. He\nfrowned. What place is that? I've never\nheard of it. The female subhuman happily\nexplained, \"Oh, haven't you received the\npropaganda leaflet?\" The powerful\nawakened one, Lady Anna, relied on her\nown strength to successfully negotiate\nterms with the Church of the Colonial\nEmpire. The church agreed to gift the\nentire East Grave Town to Lady Anna to\ngovern, making it a home for subhumans.\nThere, we won't have to worry about food\nand clothing. We'll be free and at ease\nwith fine delicacies every day. The more\nshe spoke, the more captivated the\npasserby became. Most importantly, Lady\nAnna has grasped the correct method for\nsubhumans to awaken. Any subhuman who\ncomes to East Gravetown can receive the\nbest education, and if their talent is\nsufficient, they will be able to awaken\ntheir bloodline power. The male subhuman\npasserby found this very appealing\nawaken bloodline power. Is that for\nreal? The little girl with him was also\noverjoyed. Wow, is there really such a\nplace? Of course, it's real. My friends\nhave all gone to the park, but I was\njust delayed for a bit due to some\npersonal reasons. The subhuman man\nhesitated, not knowing if going now\nwould still give him a chance to have\nhis awakening ability tested by Lady\nAnna. And he also hesitated if his\nlittle sister by you went with him. She\nwould have a better chance at education\nand awakening, but such a good thing.\nSuddenly, their conversation was\nsuddenly interrupted by a masked person.\nAre you looking for the way to the\nsubhuman park? The subhuman man was\nanxious. You know where it is. The mass\nperson enthusiastically gave directions.\nOf course, East Gravetown is right next\ndoor. I was just returning from buying\nmaterials for the awakening assembly. If\nyou want to go, I can take you with me.\nThe subhuman girl was excited. That's\ngreat. The subhuman man's sister urged\nher big brother, \"Brother, why don't we\ngo together?\" The subhuman man was still\nhesitant, but the passers by were in an\nuproar. It's It's her highness, the\nsaintest. Her highness, the saintest is\nback. Everyone turn around. Her highness\nthe saintest. But but why is her\nhighness the saintest with the army of\neagle crest? Roy was walking down the\nstreet with Grimon when she heard a\nvoice call out, \"Saintest big sister.\"\nAs soon as she turned around, a very\nadorable little subhuman girl rushed to\nhug her waist. \"You're back by miss you\nso much.\" She said, \"By you.\" She was\nhalfway through her sentence when\nsomeone pulled Ba back forcefully and\nsaid, \"Ba, come back right now. We have\nto go.\" Ba turned to look at her\nbrother, bewildered and not\nunderstanding what was happening. Seeing\nthe person approach, Roy said, \"Odo,\nwhere are you two going?\" By spread her\narms and said with a bright smile,\n\"We're going to East Grave Town. There's\na subhuman park there. Many subhumans\nlive there very happily. Even talented\nsubhumans can successfully awaken their\nabilities. Saint his big sister, come\nwith us.\" Hearing this, Roy was startled\nand asked again, \"Esce gravetown a\npark?\" At this point, she gritted her\nteeth and thought coldly. As expected,\nshe recalled her conversation with Sib.\nShe wanted to save the subhumans. Roy\nknelt down and said sincerely, \"As long\nas I can save them, no matter what you\nwant me to do, I am willing.\" Seeing Roy\nkneel, Sibbon blurted out, \"You.\" Then\nhe gave a sly smile, came closer, and\nlifted Royy's chin with his hand,\nsaying, \"You guess what I wanted to ask?\nSo, you deliberately said that, right?\nAre you looking forward to it hearing\nthis?\" Roiy's face turned red, and she\nsaid shily, \"You, I'm being serious.\"\nSibbon asked her in return, \"Is that so?\nWhat if the price is to harm the\nsubhumans? Price? Hearing this, Roy was\nsurprised and questioned. Harm? At this\nmoment, Sib said, \"Seriously, if you\nwant to save the subhumans, you must do\nas I say, whether you are willing or\nnot.\" Thinking of this, Roy made up her\nmind and said to the butler, \"Grim,\narrest them all.\" The subhumans were\nalarmed upon hearing this. \"What?\"\nGrimmmont raised his hand and signaled\nthe soldiers move. The subhumans were\ntied up, some lifted up, crying. Vansen\nsaid, \"Your highness, the Saints, why is\nthis happening? Help! Save us! We don't\nwant to be captured by the Lord of Eagle\nCrest.\" \"So, so I also called out an\nalarm, Saint Big Sister.\" Roiy's face\nwas completely flushed at this moment.\nShe closed her eyes, clased her hands,\nand thought, \"I'm sorry. Everyone must\nendure. Only in this way can I ensure\nyou all escape a terrible fate.\" Sibbon\nwas currently sitting in a flying\ncarriage in the sky. He smiled and said,\n\"Leaving Divine Light Town to Roy should\nbe no problem. After all, she is\nGrimmont to help her.\" Lori, sitting\nbeside him, asked, \"Master, why didn't\nyou bring Mr. Grimmont along to meet the\ncrown prince at Greystone Ridge?\" Sibbon\nreplied, \"They have other things to do\nbesides, this time, the nobles are\ngathering here. It's the crown prince\nwho requested our aid. There won't be\nany danger.\" A moment later, the\ncarriage arrived. This was a prosperous\nand bustling city. on the streets.\nPeople were hawking their wares\nanimatedly. Does anyone need a guide?\nFor just five copper coins, I'll take\nyou to enjoy the scenery all over\nGreystone Ridge. Come and see. Come and\nsee. Freshly made booster potions here.\nReasonable price and it comes with a\nfree bottle of stamina potion. The\ngreaves of ambassador Caris of Greystone\nCity, usable by both mages and knights.\nOnly one left. Sibbon was currently\nholding Lorie's hand, strolling happily\nthrough the streets. Lorie looked around\ncuriously at everything. Master, the\nnights in Greystone City are so lively.\nSib could only sigh and think to\nhimself. Eagle Crest is truly a place\nwhere birds don't even bother to\nLook at this place. Although there\naren't an extreme number of mages, in\nterms of density, it's definitely no\nless than the knights in London City.\nSuddenly, Lorie's face flushed red as\nshe pointed and said, \"Amma, master,\nthat is hearing this.\" Sibbon looked in\nthe direction she was pointing. It was a\nnobleman holding a leash tied to the\nneck of a subhuman crawling on the\nground wearing a very sexy pink night\ngown. Seeing the scene, Sibbon could\nonly curse inwardly. Holy it\nreally is a big city. They play rough.\nHe noticed Lor's reaction next to him\nwas a bit off. So, he looked over. Lori,\nwhy are you looking over there with such\nadmiring eyes? He only thought this, but\ndidn't dare to ask less you demand to\nimitate it. And also that guy is. As he\nlooked over, the nobleman also looked at\nhim. He smiled brightly and said, \"Look\nwho it is. Long time no see, Count\nSibbin, the second son of the Golden\nLion family.\" Sibbin smiled and replied,\n\"Greetings, your highness, the crown\nprince.\" After greeting him, he thought\nto himself, \"Crown Prince Bellaflin.\"\nThat night, the moon was very full and\nbeautiful. In the bedroom, Lorie was\nwearing a very sexy outfit. She was\npressing on top of Sibbon saying\ncoetishly, \"Master, Lorie still wants to\nkiss.\" Sibbin lay properly, his face\nflushed red, and said, \"The elucory holy\ngarment isn't for you to play like\nthis.\" Saying that, he sat up and kissed\nLor's forehead, saying, \"I really don't\nknow what to do with you.\" She was a\nlittle shy, but not satisfied. So, she\npushed Sibbon down on the bed and said,\n\"You can't just kiss my forehead. Master\nis being prefuncter again.\" Sib laughed\nand said, \"As expected, it's not enough,\nhuh?\" Lorie proactively pushed him down\nand kissed him on the lips. The two of\nthem embraced and kissed passionately. A\nmoment later, he stroked her head and\nasked, \"Is that enough now?\" It seemed\nLorie was still not satisfied. He\nthought to himself, \"If this continues,\nI'm really going to fire the gun.\" Lorie\npropped herself up and protested. But\nmaster Lorie wants Siban flicked her\nforehead, cutting her off. You're not\nallowed to want. This isn't Lawn Dong\nCity. Besides, we have to attend a\nroundt conference tomorrow. Hearing\nthis, Lorie was annoyed and recalled\nChris's words. If you get rejected again\nnext time, just say this. Then she\nleaned in and whispered to Sibbon,\n\"Master, is it true that you really\ncan't perform?\" Hearing this, Sibbon's\nface darkened, not bothering to refute\nit. The next morning in the council\nchamber, the crown prince spoke up.\n\"Let's begin now. Those who wanted to\nattend the conference are all here now.\nAs for those that didn't want to come,\nthere's no need to wait any longer. You\nall must have heard. His majesty the\nking has returned to the embrace of the\nLord Ba. Currently, the Cologne Empire\nhas a third legendary level powerhouse.\nThe Pope is now plotting to user the\nroyal authority, unify royal power and\ndivine right to become the sole dictator\nof the Cologne Empire. I believe you\nhave all heard more or less about the\nchurch's way of doing things. Although\nwe both worship Lord Backda, the people\nof the church are from beginning to end\nlunatics. Hearing this, everyone started\nmurmuring. How can that be? Sib looked\nover and thought to himself, \"What a top\ntier description.\" He pondered. Not\nhaving a legendary level powerhouse\nmeans losing the power to intimidate\nsurrounding nations. And now the Pope is\nplotting to user the throne,\nsignificantly weakening the last\nvestigages of the Cologne Empire\nstrength. What is the best course of\naction? If the Cologne Empire is invaded\nby another empire, I'm afraid the first\nto suffer will be us lords. Someone\nsuggested, \"Why don't we just gather our\nmoney and run?\" At this moment, a shout\nwas heard. Silence. It startled everyone\nwho was murmuring. Sib, however, had no\nreaction. The big-nosed, pot-bellied man\nsaid, \"Look at the state of you all. Do\nyou still look like glorious imperial\nnobles? A bunch of trash.\" The crown\nprince laughed and intervened. All\nright, Calani, it's time to tell\neveryone the good news. Hearing this,\nthe big-nosed, pot-bellied man\nexplained. Although the Pope is very\nwell prepared, it will still take time\nto take down the royal capital. And now\nwith so many lords united like this,\nit's not like there's no chance of\nvictory. No joke, a group of outlanders\nwho can endlessly resurrect has also\nreached a cooperation with the crown\nprince. They will help us crush the\nchurch's most numerous core forces.\nHearing this, Sibbon was immediately\nstartled and surprised. Everyone began\nto discuss. Infinite resurrection. Isn't\nthat even more terrifying than the\nundead? S the crown prince then spoke.\nPlease invite those outlanders in. A\nservant replied, \"Yes.\" Sibbon was\nquestioning in his heart. \"Outlanders\nwho can endlessly resurrect. No matter\nhow you hear it, it sounds just like\nplayers. Huh?\" The conference room door\nopened and a group of five people walked\nin led by a person in a trendy green\nfrog costume who spoke up to greet them.\n\"Good day, your highness the prince.\nGood day, my lords.\" After saying that,\nhe glanced at Sibbon and whispered,\n\"Good day, lord of eagle crest. We meet\nagain.\" Seeing this, Sibbon smiled\nwithout saying anything. He thought to\nhimself, \"How did this damn group of\nplayers silently contact the royal\ncapital? Weren't they supposed to have\nreturned to Divine Light Town?\" Sibbon\nstared at the group of players,\npondering what the hell do these damn\nplayers want to do? Could it be that\nafter the failed attack on Lawn Dong\nCity, these player representatives\nlearned a painful lesson, gave up the\nmain quest of killing the Lord and\nsaving the saints, and started looking\nfor a new way out for the players? At\nthis moment, the people around were\nmurmuring. Backda above Kalani is too\nbig. Silence. As mentioned before, the\nmain source of the church's military\npower is a few nobles and the royal\nlegions that have defected to the pope.\nTheir numbers are extremely huge. But\nnow that we have these resurrecting\noutlanders, it could be considered that\nthey have helped us solve this difficult\nproblem. The most important purpose of\nsummoning you all here today is to deal\nwith another branch of the church's\nforces, the Templar Knights. Hearing\nthis, a person raised his hand and said,\n\"Wait a minute, Lord Kalani. As far as I\nknow, the number of Templar knights is\nless than 100, even if they are all\nEarth Knights.\" Casually sending a\nmarquee from central territory would be\nenough to easily suppress them. Where is\nthe need to use so many of our troops?\"\nCalante closed his eyes and said with a\nsarcastic smile, \"Fool, go back and\ncheck if your territory spies are\nspending all day gathering intelligence\non women.\" 100 Templar knights was a\nyear ago. Now the church's Templar\nknights number close to 1,000. In\naddition, they have at least 30 who were\nsky knights. The person who spoke was\nalarmed and stood up, saying, \"TH 30 sky\nknights, how is that possible?\" The\nothers also began to worry and murmur.\nThat's more than three times the number\nof sky knights in the royal army. Kalani\nspoke up and asked, \"Frog, uh, your\nexcellency scheming frog, can you\noutlanders reach Greystone City within\nhalf a month?\" After asking, he also\nwearily thought to himself, \"What kind\nof name is that?\" The player scheming\nfrog listened attentively, then smiled\nand replied, \"We Outlanders have very\nfew means of transportation, but we will\ntry to gather quickly and head towards\nGreystone City.\" Hearing this, Kalani\nsaid, \"If that's the case, we at\nGreystone City will dispatch mages to\nhelp you build a temporary teleportation\ncircle. You can come directly through\nthe circle, but you must be quick. The\nteleportation circle's consumption is\nextremely high, meaning even Greystone\nCity cannot sustain it for too long.\nScheming Frog replied, \"In that case, I\nam truly grateful for your benevolence.\"\nThe crown prince, who had been thinking,\n\"Just listen with a faint smile.\" Seeing\nthis, Sibbon thought to himself, \"What a\nsmug look. If it weren't for these\nspecial circumstances, he would never\ntolerate this uncontrollable bunch of\nplayers.\" After some time discussing the\nplan, the meeting also ended. Sibbon\nslowly walked towards the door, thinking\nto himself, \"It's finally over. Next\nup,\" as he was thinking and stepped out\nthe door, he saw a group of players.\nLet's see what this bunch of players who\ndon't know their own limits wants to do.\nSeeing Sibbon come out, scheming frog\ngreeted him. Long time no see, Lord\nEagle Crest. Sibbon smiled and replied,\n\"It hasn't been that long, just a bit\nunexpected. Why have you all appeared\nhere and even specially ambushing me\nhere? Surely you don't want to drag me\ninto the woods to play games, do you?\nThe male players heard this and angrily\nsaid, \"Who would want to? Are you crazy,\nyou guy?\" While the female players\nblushed and disgusted among themselves,\nI think it's fine. After all, Lord Eagle\nCrest is very right. Hearing this,\nScheming Frog's face darkened, and he\ninterrupted the chattering crowd. Let's\ntalk business. I heard you're blatantly\ncapturing subhumans. I want to know why\nyou were doing that. Sibbon smiled and\nsaid, \"If I said it was to protect the\nsubhumans, would you believe me? I'm\ntelling you the church is capturing\nsubhumans for experiments. Do you\nbelieve me?\" Hearing this, the players\nall started talking at once. \"What\nprotects subhumans? Are you\nbullshitting?\" Seeing this, Sibbon\nwalked straight ahead, pushing the\nplayers aside, making them stumble left\nand right, saying, \"You were the ones\nwho asked, and when I answer, you don't\nbelieve me. Then good dogs shouldn't\nblock the way.\" One of the players who\nfell said angrily, \"What the hell? He\neven pushed me.\" As expected, \"This guy\ncan't be telling the truth.\" Scheming\nfrog just rubbed his head. It was\nunclear what he was thinking. When\nSibbon returned to his room, Lorie,\nwearing a maid outfit, enthusiastically\ngreeted him, \"Master, you're back.\" Then\nshe rushed into his arms and said, \"Lori\nhas been missing you, master, so much\nthat I was about to die.\" Seeing this,\nSibbon could only cough dryly. At this\nmoment, a servant interrupted their\nreunion, \"I'm sorry to disturb you. Your\nexcellency, the count, his highness, the\nprince, requests your presence.\" Sibbin\nasked in confusion right after the\nmeeting just ended. Lorie, having just\nreunited with her master, only to be\ninterrupted, angrily puffed her cheeks\nand hugged Sibbon tightly, looking\nextremely adorable. The servant spoke\nfearfully, \"Oh, I'm terribly sorry, but\nit's probably not anything bad. His\nhighness, the prince, has already met\nwith four other lords. You are the\nfifth. That's right. You may may also\ncome along. Hearing this, Lorie's\nattitude changed immediately. Sib\nthought to himself, \"Aha, he's just\nacting as if he's about to become king,\nwanting to recruit some potential\nnobles. So confident, he's already\nconsidering matters of his ascension\nbefore the war has even started.\"\nHearing she was allowed to go, Lorie\nhugged Sibbon tightly and asked\nketishly, \"Can I master?\" He smiled and\nreplied, \"Of course.\" Worthy of being\ncalled the star of the empire, Count\nEaglerest was accepted as a disciple by\nLord Soden. At 20 years old, he already\npossesses the strength of Sky Knight.\nHis highness, Prince Baliviver, raised\nhis wine glass, offering praise to\nSibbon. He humbly replied, \"You are too\nkind. Who would dare to accept such\npraise from his highness the prince, the\narrogant prince, sitting on his throne,\nsipped a glass of red wine while using a\npetite maid as a foottool? The small\ngirl trembled, not daring to resist. I\ngreatly admire a talented youth like\nCount Eagle Crest. Perhaps it is with\nthe guidance of Lord Barta that we are\nable to meet in the inner city. Sibbon\nsat upright in his chair, observing this\nvery royal lunchon. I'm a little\ncurious. So, this is the prince's style\nof lunchon, or is it because of Lor's\npresence that he thinks I like this sort\nof thing? Either way, it's unsettling.\nThen, as a prince of the Cologne Empire,\nI must also make a gesture. As he spoke,\nhe stepped on the beautiful elf's neck.\nThe girl cried silently, holding back\nthe pain as tears streamed down her\nface. The prince heard the girl's soft\nwhimpers, frowned, and pulled the chain\naround her neck tighter. \"This is an elf\nmaiden that General Kellani captured at\nthe jade border, although she's not any\nrare species.\" He trailed off, recalling\nthe scene at that time. But back then,\nshe snuck into the stronghold alone,\nassassinating over 80 soldiers and two\nof my great earth knights. Luckily, as\nshe was leaving the stronghold, she\nfoolishly stepped on a trap and that's\nhow we caught her. She almost pulled it\noff and yet not a single soldier could\nfight her. She was still untouched. Her\nmagic power has been sealed. After\ncapturing her, I just had people torture\nand whip her for a month. The prince\ntightened the caller's rope. As long as\nyou like her, this top quality elf slave\nwill be yours. Not a bad collector's\nitem, right? Sib truly felt insulted. He\nwas indeed being seen as one of this\nguy's kind. He tactfully refused the\nprince's offer. \"No, how could I take\naway his highness, the prince's toy?\"\nLori, sitting beside him, was trembling\nnon-stop. The prince seemed to have\nother intentions. \"No need to be so\npolite.\" He said cheerfully, \"If you\nreally mind, \"Ah, that's right.\" Saying\nso, he pointed towards Lorie. \"Then\nlet's trade yours for mine. What do you\nthink?\" Lori was speechless, not daring\nto protest. I'm very interested in your\nmaid. If you're willing to give her to\nme, I can grant you one condition. A\nthief, weapons, an army. I can grant you\nanything. Sibbon was truly furious. He\nsmiled gently, but a few cracks appeared\non the wine glass in his hand. I'm\nsorry, your highness the prince. I must\nrefuse. Everyone has their own way of\nplaying. I still cherish my maid very\nmuch. Without her care, I would be very\ntroubled. The prince acted as if he\nunderstood. Oh, so Count Eaglerest is\nthat kind of person. I understand. I\nunderstand. He released his hand,\nletting the elf maiden catch her breath.\nBut that's not important. I can still\ngive this elf slave to you. He\ngenerously offered her to him. Sib still\nadamantly refused. Thank you for your\nkind intentions, your highness. But the\nEagle Crest thief is a borderland. War\ncould break out at any time. We must\nconstantly maintain high alert. It's\nbetter not to indulge too much. His\nmeaning was very clear. Go give her to\nsomeone else. Don't push her on to me.\nSuddenly, Lorie, sitting beside him,\nlooked down. A thin, pale hand was\nstruggling to reach out and touch her\nleg. The prince, looking disappointed,\nsaid, \"Is that so? Then I guess I'll\njust have to throw her into the barit\ninfirmary at the jade border.\" The\npink-haired elf maiden tearfully mouthed\nfor Lorie to understand. \"Save, save me,\nplease.\" Lorie suddenly began to cry\nuncontrollably. She fell into a\ndreamscape. It was the world tree, a\nscene of widespread slaughter. elves,\nspirits, soldiers, civilians. It was\nimpossible to tell who was who. Lor's\nemotions fell into a deep pit of\ndespair, like a vicious cycle. Sibbon\nnoticed Lorie's abnormality. He softly\ncalled out to her to wake her from the\ndreamscape. Lorie suddenly mustered her\ncourage and asked the prince that um may\nI ask your highness if she is thrown\ninto the barracks infirmary, what will\nhappen to her? The expression on his\nface turns savage. I'm not sure either,\nbut those wounded soldiers hate elves\nthe most. Perhaps she won't even last a\nfew days in there before being tortured\nto death. Or maybe she'll be chopped\ninto pieces and fed to the dogs. Who\nknows? Haha. Baliviver said\nperceptively, \"Your maid seems\ninterested in this slave. Do you want to\nreconsider and take her in?\" he said\nwhile pulling the collar tight. Although\nSib didn't understand, he still accepted\nthe gesture. In that case, thank you for\nthe gift, your highness, the prince.\nBaliviver happily swirled his wine\nglass. You really do dot on that maid of\nyours. Leaving the prince's luxurious\nroom with the elf slave, Sibbon felt\nmore relaxed. He tied the elf maiden\nonto the back of the large bird. This\nshould be fine. The skill I learned from\nthe roundfaced little sister is useful\nafter all. He turned around and saw Lori\nstill standing there waiting for him.\nWhat's wrong, Lori? Didn't I tell you to\nget on first and wait for me? He was\nworried her legs would get tired from\nwaiting and that talking with that\nBalvern guy earlier must have made her\nvery tense and scared. Lorie stammered,\n\"Um, that thath.\" After a while, she\nfinally managed to say what she meant.\nMy master, Lori has caused trouble for\nyou. She was extremely worried. Sibbon\ndidn't care that much. He swept Lorie up\nin his arms and gave her a deep kiss.\nIsn't it just selling a favor? It's no\nbig deal. Anyway, if he didn't give me\nthe elf, he would have given me\nsomething else. If I hadn't accepted, I\nwouldn't have been able to leave\nGreystone City. Before Lorie could come\nto her senses, he had already placed her\ndown on the seat. Lorie blushed and\nchided, \"Master, honestly, we're on a\nmain road. It's so embarrassing.\"\nSibbons smiled brightly. \"Then let's\ncontinue when we get home.\" Lorie said\nhappily, \"Make a baby when we get home,\nMaster. Except for that, Lorie.\" The\nlarge bird spread its wings and flew\naway from Greystone City, carrying the\nman and woman along with the still\nunconscious elf maiden. Meanwhile, in\nthe middle of a forest, a subhuman named\nMedua was trembling behind a bush. What\nshould I do? What should I do? What\nshould I do? All around were shouts\nurging, \"Move it. Don't doawle.\" Ahead\nwas the saint's carriage convoy. The\nsaint was actually leading human\nsoldiers to capture subhumans. I can't\nstay here any longer. She spread some\nmaps on the ground, confused. But\nbesides Divine Light Town, where else\ncan I go? Ah, she happily grabbed a\npiece of paper. That's right, the\nsubhuman park. So, there's a way to\nsurvive. She sat down to study the map.\nH, I see. I just need to go to East\nGravetown then. Blah blah. Absorbed in\nstudying the map. She didn't notice two\nbig brothers had returned and were\nstanding behind her. Hey, isn't this a\nchild from Divine Light Town? Little\none, why did you run all the way here by\nyourself? She ran over crying. Big\nBrother Lling. Boohoohoo. She recounted\nwhat she had just seen to the two of\nthem. Everyone was captured by Lord\nEagle Crest. Even Sistui has been\nbrainwashed. How could something so\nabsurd happen? The two of them couldn't\nbelieve their ears. But but Medua knows\nEast Gravetown has a subhuman park. We\ncan find a powerful awakened subhuman to\nhelp us and beg that great lord to save\neveryone. Little one, slow down. What\nEast Grave Town? A while later at the\nsubhuman park, the atmosphere here was\nextremely lively. Everything was\npeaceful and happy, as if the outside\nworld had no effect on this place.\nEverywhere were invitations. Please have\na cup of this honey water. Welcome to\nthe subhuman park. The three people with\ntheir strange appearance entered the\npark, surprising the greeter at the\ngate. As sorry, it's the first time I've\nseen such strange. Oh no, such special\nsubhumans. The two big brothers were all\nso awkward. It's nothing. We'll handle\nit ourselves. We've traveled a long way\nfrom the northern lands through wind and\ndew. So, our fur and hair are a bit\nshabby. The gatekeeper had to suppress\nher emotions, mainly because the\ndemihuman girl was too ugly. It was the\nfirst time she had seen someone so ugly.\nOf course, she only dared to think this\nto herself. So, that's how it is. But\ndon't worry, the demihuman park will\nhelp you. First, let us take you to have\na meal. The gatekeeper led the guests\nwhile introducing the surroundings, but\nthe two of them didn't hear a single\nword. Hey, have you noticed anything?\nYeah. Even going to eat? were\naccompanied by strange mass soldiers.\nIt's really suspicious. The three of\nthem try to act as naturally as\npossible, sitting down at the table for\na sumptuous meal. Doesn't it feel\nunreasonable? It's not like they're\ntreating criminals. Speaking of\nunreasonable, the part's propaganda has\nbeen completely unreasonable from the\nvery beginning. This right now is\nclearly to prevent the demihumans from\nrunning away. Medua, as if starved,\nignored the two's discussion, her eyes\nshining as she looked at the hot food\nbeing laid out before her. A clear voice\ncame from a distance. Hello, new\ncompatriots. It was a hot red-haired\ndemihuman. She seemed to be a waitress\nhere. I am your person in charge. Chia,\nfrom now on, I will be your guide,\nteaching you how to live in East Grave\nTown and what rules you must follow.\nChia, wearing a seductive red dress,\nwalked over. After everyone has eaten\ntheir fill, I will take you to\nparticipate in the town welcoming\nceremony here. By the way, you can also\nmeet our leader, Lady Anna. She is\nrevered by the human church as Fukwa,\nthe surrounding demihumans were\noverjoyed. We finally escaped that\ndreadful eagle crest thief. This really\nis the demihuman park. It's all real.\nOnly a leader who even the human church\nrespects could establish this park. The\nthree of them remained silent. Chia\nresponded cheerfully. I uh it seems\neveryone is eager to meet Fuk. O, aren't\nyou? Cheers erupted from all around.\nYes, yes, exactly. Then everyone, please\nfinish your meal quickly and follow me.\nThat lady is in the cathedral, earnestly\nwanting to meet you all. Chia's\nexpression became frightening. The\ntowering cathedral behind her seemed to\nbe emitting some kind of charm, hiding a\nmysterious secret waiting to be\ndiscovered. Throughout the city, there\nwere clouds of crimson gas everywhere.\nOn the stage, Anna spread her arms and\nsaid, \"Welcome everyone to East Grave\nTown. In the future, this place will\nbecome your home. I am a subordinate of\nthe gods, a handmaiden of fire, Anna.\nYou can also call me Fukcoa. However, to\nlive in this park, you must offer a part\nof your own power. Your blood, body, and\nsoul will all bring joy to our Lord. Are\nyou willing to offer your all to the\nLord?\" She wore a red dress with a slit\nthat exposed half a leg all the way to\nher waist. And with her sensual gaze and\nalluring lips, it made people stare,\nunable to look away. The demihumans\nbelow, after hearing her speak,\nresponded with great excitement and\nenthusiasm. We are willing for the glory\nof demihumans, for the future of\ndemihumans. But there were exceptions.\nWeen holding little girl and Hap 2\ncovering his nose whispered to each\nother, \"Absolutely do not let Meua\ninhale this gas. The system keeps\nwarning of an abnormal status.\" Looking\nat the situation around us, it's clear\nthis is not a demihuman park at all. We\nhave to get Medua out of here quickly.\nAnna continued to pose seductively and\nsaid, \"Next, the town entry ceremony\nbegins.\" Behind the iron bars behind her\nwere what looked like the silhouettes of\ndemons with blazing red eyes and sharp\nteeth. Seeing this, Waqen and Hapu\nthought in horror, \"Demonic beasts.\" The\nreleased demonic beasts roared\nferociously, staring intently at the\ncrowd of demihumans. Anna shouted,\n\"Revel my kin.\" Seeing that the crowd\nwas not afraid, but was cheering\ninstead. Waqen and Hapu whispered, \"Are\nthey insane? We have to run.\" But the\ndemonic beasts were very fast and\nferocious, approaching to tear their\nclothes and grab them. We cursed loudly.\nHoly these demihumans have all\ngone mad from inhaling that gas. Hapu\ncried out, \"Let go. I already have\nsomeone I like.\" This guy's torn. Anna\non the stage noticed something strange\nand looked in this direction. She said\nin surprise, \"Humans, soldiers, go kill\nthose two spies. Don't let them escape\nunder any circumstances.\" The two of\nthem were backto back in a defensive\nstance against the surrounding demonic\nbeasts. On the flying vehicle, Sibbon\nwas sitting with Lori when his system\nmessage arrived. He opened it in\nsurprise to see daily villain mission\nupdate. Villain mission one, kill Fuk\nOA. Villain mission two, destroy the\ndemihuman park. Villain mission three,\nleave a psychological scar on at least\n100 players. Seeing this, Sibbon's head\nwas full of question marks as he thought\nthese missions telling me to go to East\nGravetown now and destroy it. But\nspeaking of opportunities, this is\nindeed an opportunity. After all, the\nsky knights must have already been\ndeployed to the royal capital. East\nGravetown should be at its weakest right\nnow. Thinking this, he said, \"Fire, turn\naround. Fly northeast.\" The Firebird\nheard the command, screeched loudly, and\nchanged direction. In East Grave Town,\nthe two were now running with the little\ngirl in their arms, fleeing from the\nfireballs created by the demonic beasts.\nDamn it. Although there's nothing too\nstrong, their average level isn't much\ndifferent from ours, but there are just\ntoo many of them. The rat tooththed\nsoldiers looked towards the three and\nlaughed. Not bad. Not only did a\ndemihuman child come, but also a mage.\nThey're all topgrade experimental\nmaterials. Don't kill them. Capture them\nalive. Lady Fuk OA will reward us. Ween\nholding a little girl while running\nsaid, \"That's right, Hapu. Have you\nscreenshotted the situation and posted a\ncall for help on the forums yet?\" Hapu\nlaughed and said, \"Don't worry. I\nscreenshotted a long time ago and posted\nit to the World Channel. It's\nprofessional instinct.\" At this moment\non the forums, there was a post with an\nimage of demonic beasts attacking\ndemihumans. East Grave Town in the\nFrostorn Range next to Greystone Thief\nis using our divine light town residence\nas expiry. Mince my friend Waqen and I\nare carrying a little demihuman girl\nnamed Medua and are being hunted by the\nguards of East Gravetown. Urgent call to\narms. In the picture, Medua was\nterrified, her mouth open in a loud cry.\nSeeing this, people immediately\nresponded, \"Holy where are you,\nbro? Send me your coordinates right\nnow.\" Damn, is this for real? Little\nMeua, I just told her a children's fairy\ntale. Send the coordinates. We handed\nMeua back to Hap 2 and drew his sword.\nRemember to keep holding on. You run.\nI'll go to the respawn point and come\nright back. Hearing this, Hapu asked,\n\"Are you planning to become a hero\nhere?\" Walken charged into the demonic\nbeast behind them, saying, \"Melee\nfighters don't need to worry about\nrunning out of energy.\" Hearing this,\nHapu turned and ran, saying, \"Makes\nsense.\" Medual watched Waqen's back,\ncrying and calling out, \"Brother Ling\nKaka, we are we going to die here? It's\nbecause Medua said we had to come to\nEast Gravetown that I've harmed you\nbrothers.\" Hearing this, Hapu patted the\nlittle girl's back to comfort her,\nsaying, \"He'll be fine, little Medua.\nYou know we can respawn, right?\" After\nspeaking, he thought to himself, \"The\nproblem is when NPCs die, it's really\nthe end for them. Why are these soldiers\nclinging to us like mad dogs?\" As he was\nrunning, a very large shadow of a\nfirebird enveloped him. Meduis stopped\ncrying, raised her head to look at the\nflying vehicle in the sky and said\ncuriously, \"Brother Ling, brother Ling,\nKaka, in the sky, there's a giant bird\nin the sky.\" Sib looked down and thought\nto himself, \"It's so noisy down there.\nIs someone being hunted? A little\ndemihuman child and a player.\" After\nthinking, he stood up on a flying\nvehicle and said, \"Fire, take your\nmistress to the sky above that forest\nand wait for me. If you encounter\ndanger, descend.\" The firebird turned\nits head back to confirm the mistress\nwas Lori, then screeched loudly to\nconfirm it understood. After giving his\ninstructions, he jumped straight down\nfrom the flying vehicle in a freef fall.\nFrom above, Lorie shouted a reminder,\n\"Master, please be careful. You must\ncome back soon.\" Sib, holding his sword\nas he free fell, replied, \"Okay, I\npromise.\" As soon as he landed, he\ncrushed a rat tooththed soldier flat.\n\"Oops, wrong landing spot. Stepped on a\nbug. Or was it a rabbit?\" Seeing him\nfall, Hapu was also startled and looked\nover. Who did he recognize immediately?\nLord Eagle Crest. Sibbin was very\nefficient. Upon landing, he immediately\nrushed into battle. He unleashed slashes\nof purple sword key, cutting down the\nenemies. Haptu thought to himself. As\nexpected, the giant bird Meda just saw\nis his mount. Why do I run into this NPC\neverywhere? With such a high appearance\nrate, I seriously suspect Lord Eagle\nCrest is the final boss of the current\nversion. And real men should indeed play\nwith great swords. Look at that\neffortless single slash. We're both\nmelee fighters. Why is he so handsome?\nVery quickly, there were no rat\ntooththed soldiers left around. Sibbon\nslung his sword over his shoulder and\nwondered, \"So that's it.\" Hapu and Meda\napproached and said, \"Ah, thank you for\nyour help, Lord Eaglecrest.\" Hearing\nthis, Sibbon smiled and replied, \"Oh,\nyou mean you want to thank me?\" Hapu\nbroke out in a sweat and said, \"Ah, what\ndo you want? My self-made wolf tail\nlooks pretty real. Sib laughed and said,\n\"What would I do with that toy? We're so\nfamiliar with each other. You should\nunderstand my style by now. If you truly\nwant to thank me, then repame me with\nyour body.\" Hearing this, Hapu was\nhorrified, imagining the scene of Sibbon\nlaughing leerously while defiling a\ngirl. So, he backed away repeatedly,\nsaying, \"You You're even into men,\nright? Is this a benefit designed for\nfemale players? I can't. I already have\nsomeone I like.\" Sibbon didn't care. He\nsmiled. Hug Medua and stab Hap 2\nstraight through the chest. Oh, then I\nwish you success in escaping singlehood\nsoon. From the way you talk, it's clear\nyou're in a one-sided love. Consider\nthis your thank you. It turned out Hap\n2s dirty mind was running wild. The\nresult was that he spat blood and died.\nSystem notification. You have\nbackstabbed and killed a player after\ntoying with their affections. Caused\nsevere psychological trauma. Received 50\nvillain points. Mission three progress\nplus one. Sibbon stood up and laughed.\nWho was toying with his affections?\nWasn't he the one overthinking things?\nMedua was now burying her face in his\nchest, sobbing. Sibbon pulled the little\ngirl away by her collar and asked, \"Kid,\nwhat are you making a fuss about?\" Medua\nwith tears streaming down like rain,\nsaid, \"Did did you kill brother Lane\nKaka?\" Saob sobb you bastard. You\ndemihuman catching bastard. Hearing\nthat, he asked back. You don't know he\ncan respawn. At that moment, a loud\nnoise from another direction made him\nturn his attention. Over there, a group\nof fully armed players had arrived and\nwere attacking. Brothers, charge, rescue\nthe demihuman maiden crush these beasts.\nSeeing this, the rat tooththed soldiers\nformation fell into chaos. They said in\na panic, \"Where? Where did these people\ncome from?\" \"Quick, go report to Lady\nFuko.\" Anna heard the report, frowned,\nand looked over. \"What? Suspect a news\nleak? Someone is attacking us.\" The girl\nnext to her, whose revealing attire was\nno less than Anna's, also said, \"How how\ncould they be so fast?\" Lady Anna, what\nshould we do? Hearing this, Anna has\nslapped the girl straight across the\nface and yelled, \"Just a bunch of lowly\nbugs. When something happens, all you\nknow how to do is panic and cry. As\nsorry, my lady.\" After hitting her, Anna\ngave an order, \"Awaken the ice and snow\nempress. also send a magical message to\nhis highness the wind emperor telling\nhim east grave town is under attack by\nan unknown force. We need\nreinforcements. The girl nodded in\nacknowledgement and went to carry out\nthe order immediately. Yes. On the city\nwall, a person jumped down, laughed,\nstruck a pose, then stood up, turned\nback and said, \"Brothers, I'm the first\none on the wall. Remember to screenshot\nthis for the forums for me.\" Another\nperson jumped up after him and said with\nannoyance, \"It's just getting on the\nwall. So dramatic.\" Yet another person\npoked his head up and said, \"Hey,\nBrother Ree, in front of you.\" Hearing\nthis, the first person to get on the\nwall, turned his head to look. What met\nhis eyes was a white-haired girl in a\nsexy blue bikini, posing suggestively\nand asking, \"Hey, big brother, I'm so\ncold. Can you hug me?\" Hearing this, the\nyoung man drooled and said, \"I can. Of\ncourse I can.\" After replying, he\nthought to himself, \"Holy crap, and Q,\nthese proportions are too top tier.\" The\nsexy white-haired girl rushed forward\nand wrapped her arms around Kuang Ban,\nnot Shuin's neck. She looked at him with\na gentle, affectionate gaze and said,\n\"Kaka, I'm still so cold. Hurry and hold\nme tighter.\" Faced with her charm, he\ncouldn't help but say, \"Okay, okay, hug\na little tighter.\" But the holding\ntighter here was strange. Before they\nknew it, the two were kissing\npassionately. On the city wall, a young\nman who had just climbed up drooled and\nsaid, \"What is the player Kuang Ban not\nShuin doing? He's actually hugging a\nbabe during a game war. I'm so jealous\nhearing this. The girl next to him\nsmacked him hard on the head and yelled,\n\"Babe, my ass. You male players are\nreally something else.\" Look closely.\nHer health bar is red. She's obviously a\nboss. Looking at the system display, the\nsexy white-haired girl turned out to be\nan elite holy temple knight. The ice and\nsnow empress Mirabel Skull, a temporary\nlevel 53 great demon army daist.\nNightmare. Mirabel stepped back,\nlaughed, and said, \"Foolish humans who\ndare to invade East Grave. Then feel the\nfeast of ice and snow within my body.\"\nAfter speaking, Mirabel used a skill\nfatal snowstorm. eternal curse of the\nsnow kingdom on the mortal world. Masses\nof blue airflow accompanied by ice\ncrystals appeared everywhere. Very\nquickly, the group of players was\ntrapped in large blocks of ice\neverywhere. The surrounding temperature\ndropped rapidly. Debuff effect frozen\nfor 30 seconds. The trap players chatted\nwith each other through the interface. I\ncan't move anymore. Me neither. Cold. So\ncold. Why can this game only adjust the\npain sensation? This is not good. In\nthis formation area, we'll be frozen\ninto ice statues. The debuff will be\nsent after 30 seconds. Can anyone remove\nthis debuff? Mom's cooking. I only have\n15 seconds left. At this moment, Sibbon\nwas moving through the air, holding his\nsword. a yellow energy swirling around\nthe blade. As he approached the city\nwall, he was also affected by the skill,\nbut he was not frozen. Quickly, he\nreached the frozen players. Seeing this,\neveryone started buzzing. I'm not seeing\nthings, am I? Was that Lord Eagle Crest\nwho just passed by? Where's the\nscreenshot? How can Eagle Crest be\nyellow? Damn it. Is it for real? What's\nall the noise? If his health bar isn't\nlit up, I'm actually a bidden used to\nit. Sib appeared behind Mirabel and\nraised his sword. Sensing something\nbehind her, she turned and said, \"What\nis that?\" He swung his sword and the\nyellow energy took the form of a\nferocious lion's head, lunging towards\nher, but she was very fast, managing to\ndodge this violent attack in time. In\nthe air, the very sexy Mirabbel looked\ndown and said, \"Oh, so that's how it is.\nIs this Kaka Sky Knight?\" Sib charged\nforward again, thrusting straight at\nher. She quickly drew a circular pattern\nto block him, saying, \"Kaka, you're too\nfast. Slow down a bit.\" The two streams\nof blue and yellow power collided\nviolently. Sibbon set in indifferently.\nCompared to our little Lowy's master,\n\"This kaka of yours truly has no soul.\"\nThe ice and snow empress. Right. Watch\nme defeat you. After speaking, he swung\nhis sword down hard. A huge stream of\nyellow power slammed into her, causing\nMirabel to fall straight to the ground,\ncrashing and sending dirt and rocks\nflying. Taking the hit, she cried out,\n\"Ah, that hurts.\" But she changed her\ndemeanor very quickly. By the time\nSibbon landed, she was already sitting\nup, smiling, and saying, \"Wait, wait. I\nsurrender. Please spare me.\" Then she\nused her old trick, getting close to\nSibbon, hugging his arm, and saying\nseductively, \"As long as you're willing\nto spare me, I'm willing to offer my\neverything to you.\" Then she leaned in\nwith her sexy lips, and said, \"Let\nMirabel kiss you and serve you.\" Her\nwords were answered by a sword, piercing\nstraight through her. Sib smiled and\nsaid, \"Sorry, I don't like the cold\nbeauty type, but if you're frozen solid,\nI might consider it.\" Mirabel fell to\nthe ground, blood spurting from the\nwound around her. Gasping, she said,\n\"You actually midway through her\nsentence, her life ended.\" Sib turned\nhis back, spread his arms, and said,\n\"Besides, didn't I already say your\nacting is too soulless? If this is going\nto be called an amusement park, you\nshould at least prepare some highquality\nhospitality.\" He looked straight up at\nthe sexy and on the grandstand and said,\n\"What do you think?\" Hearing this,\nAnna's cheeks flushed as she replied\nprovocatively while said, \"The aura on\nyou is truly intoxicating. Knight, why\ndon't you join us? East Gravetown really\nneeds a talent like you.\" Sib held his\nsword, thinking, \"Why bother with her?\"\nHe smiled, and a terrifying power\nenveloped his sword, creating dazzling\nsparks. Villains die from talking too\nmuch. Kill first, talk later. Sib rushed\nforward. The girl in front of him\nemitted a surrounding red aura, frowning\nat Sibbon and saying, refusing a toast,\nonly to drink a forfeit. She waved her\nhand, and the power of flames blocked\nSibbon's sword path. The red and yellow\ncolors clashed, creating a small bolt of\nlightning. She said to Sibbin, \"You are\nvery strong, I but before the vessel\nbecomes the flame, I will also be\nprotected by my master.\" Her face full\nof provocation. Sibbin hovered in\nmidair, ins snared by a red power shaped\nlike a giant dark snake with its mouth\nopen, ready to devour him. He shouted,\n\"You're a demihuman. Yet you believe in\nthe god of war and fire.\" Bada. The girl\ncontrolled her power, holding Sibbon\ntightly. He was bound upside down. She\nspoke to him nonchalantly. \"Belief and\nrace have nothing to do with each other.\nEverything was bestowed by my master. So\nnaturally, I will dedicate everything to\nmy master.\" She held a small dagger, its\nsharp tip pointed at Sibbon's neck. He\nhad now been pulled down close to her.\nTheir faces were only a short distance\napart. She said, \"A person like you who\ndoesn't know their own limits will\neventually become my food.\" Sib asked\nwith a blank expression, \"Is that so?\"\nThen he said, \"In that case, let's see\nif your master can protect you.\" She was\nsurprised, only now realizing that\nsomething was wrong. It turned out that\nwhile she wasn't paying attention,\nSibbon had left the heart of ice seal in\nher mouth. she said to Sibbon in a\npanic. The ice and snow empress's heart\nof ice seal. You're truly a mad man.\nLeaving in my mouth. She raised her hand\nto her mouth. Sib smiled thinking\nactually it's in the systems item box\nwhich is in her mouth. The heart of Ice\nSeal is an ice crystal in the shape of a\nheart. A dropped item from the ice and\nsnow empress boss after her death. The\nsystem explained. At this moment,\nSibbon's power erupted violently.\nFlashes of golden light overpowered the\ngirl's power. He said, \"Oh, you've\nweakened so quickly.\" As expected, the\nfire god has an attribute that clashes\nwith this thing. Now it's my turn. After\nspeaking, Sibbin launched a powerful\ncounterattack. At this moment, the\nopponent used a suppressive power. Her\neyes stared straight at Sibbon. Sibbin\nwas surprised, wondering, \"What's going\non? My movements have slowed down.\"\nSibbin held his sword, floating in\nspace, feeling as if all his body\nmovements were not under his control.\nThe girl now looked up at Sibbon and\nsaid, \"I'll remember you night.\" In her\nhand, she held a scroll. Inside, it was\na power formation emitting blue rays of\nlight. Sib thought, \"Could it be that\nher gaze can control the speed of my\nactions?\" The girl's eyes flashed red.\nShe gritted her teeth and said to\nSibbon, \"Wash your neck and wait for my\nmaster's iron heel.\" The blue rays of\nlight opened another dimension that was\nenveloping her. Sibbon shouted, \"You\ndamn bastard. You want to run when you\ncan't win?\" Then he swung his sword down\nforcefully. The sharps sword path blazed\nbrightly. A loud explosion rang out and\na dazzling golden light erupted like a\npowerful fire in front of the opponent\nwho was already fading away. Boom! The\nexplosion caused the church to collapse.\nThe pressure from the blast spread out\npowerfully, enveloping the surroundings.\nPeople outside screamed and fled.\nstanding amidst the smoke from the\nexplosion. One person said, \"Is this\nbecause Lord Eagle Crest is fighting\ninside?\" Another person immediately\nasked, \"So, is he dead?\" And he even\nsaid cheerfully, \"That's good news.\nLet's go look later. If he's dead, we'll\npick up his equipment. If he's half\ndead, we'll kill him. If he's jumping\naround happily.\" Before he could finish,\na figure suddenly appeared behind them\nwith blood red eyes and a squinting\nsmile. He interjected that then you'll\nbe killed by me. You like my equipment\nthat much, huh? The guys from before\nturned to look. One minute they were\nhappily chatting and making plans. The\nnext they were flustered and terrified\nto see Sibbon standing right behind\nthem. Sib held his sword and said\ncheerfully, \"Come on, no problem. Enjoy\nyourselves to the fullest.\" His mouth\nwas smiling, but a murderous aura\nsurrounded him and his eyes remained\ncold. He said, \"Welcome to East Grave\nTown.\" And then rushed in, beating the\ngroup of people relentlessly. The men\nonly had time to scream, \"Damn you!\nYou're not even the boss of this area.\nAnd he's even saying his lines when he\nappears. It's a bug. Definitely a bug.\nThe group was beaten to a pulp and the\nsurroundings were filled only with\nscreams submerged in the thick dust of\nthe horrific brawl. The system displayed\na notification. Third mission completion\nlevel plus one. Third mission completion\nlevel plus one. The beaten group\ntrembled. their eyes welling with tears\nand said, \"That's enough. It wasn't easy\nto level up again, and now we've been\nbeaten back to level zero.\" Sibbin\nrested his sword on the ground, smiled\ncheerfully, and said, \"I saw you had a\nhorse before, right? Hand over your\nhorses to me. If not, I'll just kill\nyou.\" The beaten group weakly explained,\n\"Not everyone is one.\" Another one also\nsaid, \"That's right. Horses are very\nexpensive. We're very poor.\" Sibbon\nignored them and continued, \"Hurry up.\nYou think it's over just like that? If\nyou have horses, hand them over. After\nthat, everyone strip for me. Hearing\nthis, the men were horrified, covering\ntheir bodies as if protecting their\nprecious virtue and said, \"What? What do\nyou want to do to us? Don't think you\ncan do whatever you want just because\nyou're strong and handsome.\" Sib grinned\nslightly and told them, being both\nstrong and handsome, \"Of course, I can\ndo whatever I want.\" The system\nannounced continuously. Received horse\nX20. Received equipment X20N. received\nweapon X30. The strip group could only\nscream beast while Sibbon cheerfully\nrode a horse leading several others\nbehind him as he left. At this time, the\nsystem also announced villain mission\nthree leave a psychological shadow on at\nleast 100 players has been completed. At\nthe same time, a group of people was\ncrossing the bridge into the city.\nSibbon ordered Clement take the horses\nand equipment down and store them.\nClement respectfully said, \"Yes, young\nmaster.\" Sibbon observed his\nsurroundings and said, \"So many\ndemihumans. Are they all the ones who\ncaptured Eastwood City while I was\naway?\" A voice came from a distance.\n\"Correct. They were all brought here\nfrom Divine Light Town by Clement and\nme.\" Sibbon turned to look back. Rua\nslowly approached, speaking to Sibin as\nshe walked. During her absence, I did my\nbest to explain to them the conspiracy\nof the demihuman amusement park and to\nsoothe their emotions. However, not many\nof them truly believed it. Sibbon looked\nat Ruer with a bright smile and asked\nher, \"Is that so?\" Seeing Rua's soft\nwhite tail, he couldn't help but rub\nagainst it repeatedly, sniffing it while\nsaying, \"No problem. Just as I expected.\nYou've done very well. It's normal for\nthem to have a hard time accepting it in\nsuch a short time.\" Rui, startled by the\ntouch on her tail, yelled. Then she\nthrew a hard punch at Sib's face,\nshouting, \"Let go, you pervert.\" Sibbon\ncould only weakly explain, \"I just did\nit because you looked so down.\" At that\nmoment, a fishtail thrashed powerfully\nin the pool of water next to where\nSibbon was standing. A beautiful mermaid\nwas sitting there, and several other\nmare folk around her were also looking\ntowards Sibbon. Sibon then asked, \"Are\nmer folk also demihumans?\" Rule\nexplained, \"They are, but they're\ndifferent from the aquatic races in the\nsea. The aquatic races can hardly leave\nthe water, but demihuman mare folk can\ntransform their tails into legs after\ncoming of age. The mermaid from before\nstepped out of the water. Her fish tail\nnow transformed into a perfect pair of\nlegs. Sibbon exclaimed, \"What a magical\nspecies.\" After transforming their tails\ninto legs, the mermaids jumped out of\nthe pool, running and shouting, \"Help!\nIt's Lord Eagle Crest! That tyrant is\nback.\" Both Sibbon and Ruer were\nstunned. Hearing this, Sibbon angrily\ngrabbed Ruer's tail again, and Ruer\nblushed and screamed. Under the clear\nblue sky, Ruer stood in the center and\nannounced loudly, \"All demihumans, the\nLord has an important announcement.\nPlease gather around.\" Sibbon stood with\nhis back turned. The demihumans below\nwhispered among themselves, \"Has the\nholy maiden completely submitted to the\nLord's orders now?\" The cruel lord\nSibbon stood before everyone and said\nconfidently, \"I am Lord Eagle Crest, the\nGolden Lion CV. Although you are all\ndemihumans since you are my territory,\nyou're also my people. I have gathered\neveryone here today for two reasons.\nFirst, to reveal a cruel truth to you\nall. And second, to test your abilities,\nSibbons said, standing on a high\nplatform. On one side was Ruer. On the\nother were several attendants. Below, a\ndefiant demihuman spoke up. Ridiculous.\nHis people, is he going to give us\ndemihuman land? At this time, Sib\ncontinued, \"Those who pass the test will\nstay in the castle to work, and those\nwho fail can also be given a plot of\nland. Don't worry about the land being\ntaken away.\" The Eastwood City guard\nwill protect everyone's property. Below,\nthey began to whisper after hearing the\nmention of land, turning to ask each\nother, \"Can we have our own land?\" An\nangry demihuman spoke up, \"Ba. He won't\ncare if we demihumans live or die. Even\nif we have land, we'll just be bullied\nby others. He won't save us.\" Cibin\ncontinued his speech saying,\n\"Furthermore, I will also enact laws\nregarding the rights of demihumans to\nensure the basic rights and safety of\ndemihumans in my territory.\" The\ndemihumans below were all surprised and\nskeptical. Sibbon casually continued,\n\"Now, let's talk about the cruel reality\nI mentioned earlier. I know many of you\nhave heard of Eastwood Town, the\ndemihuman amusement park, and before I\ninvited you here, some of you were\nalready on your way to Eastwood Town.\nBut now Eastwood Town has been destroyed\nby me,\" Sibbin said. Below the\ndemihumans began to wonder and were\nstunned after hearing that Eastwood Town\nwas destroyed. The demihuman who had\nbeen speaking out against Sibin's words\nshouted indignantly, \"See, I told you\nso.\" His true colors are showing. The\nland and laws are all lies to trick us.\nLord Eagle Crest just wants to cut off\nour retreat. He's a demon. Sib wave his\nhand, ordering the attendant behind him,\n\"Go call those little turnip heads up\nhere.\" The attendant immediately bowed\nand obeyed him. Several more demihumans\nappeared on the platform. Below, a stir\nwent through the crowd about the\nchildren. Someone even asked, \"Isn't\nthat little my duo? Why are they here?\"\nThe demihumans who had just stepped up\nwere all small stature girls. Each of\nthem held their skirts and bowed to\ntheir lord. Sib thought to himself,\nalthough time was short, Mrs. Chris\nstill did a great job with their basic\ntraining. Sibon then said, \"No need for\nformalities. come over here and tell\nthem what you heard and saw in Eastwood\nTown. The child obediently complied with\nhim. The demihuman turned to the crowd\nbelow and said loudly, \"Everyone, please\nlisten to me. Everything in Eastwood\nTown is a scam. It's all fake. There's\nno demihuman amusement park there at\nall. It's hell.\" The people of the Holy\nSea are imprisoning demihumans, then\ntorturing and killing them. After\nhearing this, the demihumans below were\nall utterly shocked. Someone from below\nshouted, \"Do you have any proof? What if\nyou've also been brainwashed by Lord\nEagle Crest? Hearing this, Sibbon\nthought to himself, \"It's a shame I\ndon't have such a convenient skill.\" The\nlittle demihuman asserted to everyone\nthat she had proof. She took out a piece\nof her sister's brow armor, then\nexplained, \"This is my sister's brow\narmor.\" As you all probably know, a\npanggalan armor demihuman can only have\ntheir precious brow armor removed after\ndeath. The little girl thought of her\nsister, unable to hold back her tears,\nher eyes welling up. Continuing the\nstory, that day my sister was taken away\nby them after participating in the\ninitiation ceremony and she never came\nback. I snuck to that windh hall and saw\nthem releasing crazed beastmen and\nselling demons to harm demihumans. This\nis what I managed to pick up after\nhearing this. Everyone below was\nbewildered. The whispers grew louder.\nSomeone asked, \"How could this be?\"\nSomeone else asked, \"Is it really all a\nlie? Could it be that Lord Eagle Crest\nreally saved us?\" on the platform. Sib\ninside and told the demihumans below\nthat he had ordered their capture. I\nknow you don't like a lord like me. You\nthink I invaded your homes, but if I\nhadn't forcibly issued the order, the\ndevil knows how many people would have\nrun to Eastwood Town and died tragically\nthere. I helped you for the sake of your\nholy maiden and my personal maid,\" Sib\nsaid, turning to look at Ry. Rue lowered\nher head shy. below. Everyone was\nsaying, \"So, we've wrongly blamed Lord\nEagle Crest, and we misunderstood her\nhighness, the Holy Maiden, too.\" Her\nhighness, the Holy Maiden. Sib turned\nhis back to them and said, \"Apologizing\ntoo much is useless. If you have any\nmore doubts, you can ask your holy\nmaiden and these little imps directly.\nNow, dismiss. Don't forget the test\nstarts at 5:00 p.m. Be ready.\" A few\nsmall snowflakes began to fall. Lorie\nstood behind Sibbon, her hand on his\nshoulder, asking curiously. In other\nwords, master, you want to use the power\nin your body to test them one by one\nwith a handshake? Sibbon stood there and\nlaughed loudly, saying, \"If I do that, I\nwon't be done even by tomorrow. Don't\nworry.\" Below, the demihumans looked up\nintently. Sibbon sat there cross-legged,\nleisurely, using his hand to control the\ncrystal ball in front of him,\nexplaining, \"With this crystal ball, I\ncan expand the perception range of the\ngreat wilderness's source. The ball\nemitted a soft, gentle golden light. Sib\nglanced back at Lorie, a sly look in his\neyes as he told the little girl, \"It\nwon't drain my energy for sleeping with\nyou tonight.\" Hearing this, Lorie\nblushed shily. Lorie frowned and said to\nSibbon, \"Master, you're so naughty.\nThat's not what Lorie meant.\" Sibbin\nsmiled brightly and began to unleash the\npower of the ball. The ball continuously\nemitted a stream of golden light,\nexpanding to envelop everything around.\nBelow, everyone panicked. What is this?\nSibbon explained, \"Now everyone follow\nthe awakening method in your bloodline\nmemories to perceive this thing.\nWherever the ball's light reached, it\nmade the demihuman girls feel\ncomfortable and warm.\" Everyone blushed,\nsaying they wanted to be hugged by Lord\nEagle Crest. The demihuman boys also\nfelt that Lord Eagle Crest was handsome\nand elegant and wanted to pounce on him,\ntoo. Sibbin fell silent, a stiff smile\non his face as he thought. Still none,\nnot even one. At that moment, something\nsuddenly surprised him. He glanced over.\nThe little demihuman girl, Nenah, was\nenveloped in a brilliant golden light.\nThe light flared up like erupting\nvolcanic lava, confusing the person next\nto her. The little girl's eyes were\nslightly parted, her face showing a hint\nof enjoyment. Over by the pool, a\nfishtail thrashed powerfully. The\nmermaid from before also surfaced. Her\neyes looked upward, full of submission\nto the power enveloping her\nsurroundings. Sibon was a little\nworried. Looking at the two in front of\nhim, he thought to himself with a stiff\nsmile. Finally, someone has awakened.\nBut out of 800 people, there are only\ntwo. This probability is unbelievably\nlow. Nah stood next to a small water\ncontainer. Inside the container, the\nmermaid pouted and said, \"I've been\ncaught again.\" Sibbon leaned down,\nresting his chin on his hand with an\ninterested look, and said to the\nmermaid, \"I already know Nenah. What's\nyour name?\" The mermaid shily ducked her\nhead and said to Sibbon, \"My lord, I\ndon't have a name.\" Sibbin raised his\nhand and gently touched the mermaid's\nhead, saying, \"In that case, from now\non, I'll call you Bon Bon.\" The mermaid\nsaid happily, \"Oh, from now on, my name\nis Bon Bon.\" Bong Bong. On the other\nside, Nenah excitedly shouted, \"My lord,\nmy name is Nenah.\" Sibbon slightly\nflustered said, \"I know you. You have\ngreat spirit, but next time don't shout\nso loudly.\" He then thought to himself,\n\"The current order is one, power and\nloyalty. Two, destruction, death, and\nannihilation. Three, my name is Nenah,\nfor loyal to the Lord.\" Sibbin told the\ntwo of them, \"Tell me the images you saw\nduring your perception.\" Let's start\nwith Bon Bon. Bon Bong recalled the\nimage she saw and said, \"I saw the sea,\nstorms, and a ship being swept away by a\nwhirlpool. An image of a ship struggling\nagainst massive waves appeared.\" Bon\nBong continued, \"There was also a great\nflood with waves 100 times taller than\nBon Bong.\" After listening, Sibbon\nrested his chin on his hand, smiled, and\nsaid, \"Very good. You've been\nrequisitioned by the castle. You start\nwork tomorrow. Your workplace will be on\nthe public balcony of my floor. There's\na fountain there. You can stay there for\nnow.\" Bong Bong timidly asked Sibbin. So\nif I have a job, I won't be caught by\nhumans with nets anymore, right? Sibbin,\nleaning on his hand, assured Bong Bong,\n\"Of course. Anyone who wants to catch,\nyou will have to defeat me first.\"\nHearing that, Bong Bong smiled happily\nuntil her eyes crinkled. Sib looked over\nat Nenah and said, \"It's your turn.\" Nah\nobediently complied. Nina recounted, \"My\nsituation was, first I saw a patch of\ndarkness surrounded by mud and earth,\nthen a desert and also various types of\nrocks. An image of a volcano with\nstreams of lava flowing from its mouth,\nready to erupt at any moment.\" Sibbin\nwas bewildered, wondering various types\nof rocks, minerals. Could Nah's skill be\nthrowing rocks or squeezing a\nrock-headed person? He immediately\nimagined Nenah holding a rock and\nthrowing it hard and Nah standing\nhappily next to a rock person she had\njust built. He said, \"You're also\nrequisitioned by the castle. For now, I\ndon't know what to have you do, so you\ncan lead those kids and manage them for\nme.\" Sibbin pointed behind him as a\nsignal. Nah happily shouted as you\ncommand my lord. Sibbin was startled.\nThe order in his thoughts had changed\nagain. Nenah had jumped to the second\nposition. At this moment, Sibbon stepped\ndown and said to everyone, \"All right,\nyou may all leave now. If there are any\nproblems, find Claremont.\" He called for\nClaremont, who was standing below, and\nClaremont immediately came to receive\nhis orders. Sib said to him, \"Next, we\nneed to make arrangements for these\ndemihumans. How are the reorganization\nand reforms of the outer city coming\nalong?\" Below, the demihumans were\nchattering amongst themselves. Did you\nsee Nenah and that singer have awakened?\nI can't believe Lord Eaglerest has the\nability to awaken demihumans. Claremont\nthen reported, \"My lord, the\nreorganization and reforms of the outer\ncity are basically complete. All the\nvagrants have been sent to mine iron and\nthe tiled roof housing area has been\nrepaired.\" Sibbon then gave further\norders. Help me register these\ndemihumans in a ledger. Record their\nnames, number of family members, and\ncharacteristics. Arrange jobs for them\nin East Gravetown based on this\ninformation. As for housing, put them in\na repaired tiled roof area and provide\nthem with free food for 3 days. After\nthat, we won't be responsible anymore.\nThose who work will get to eat. East\nGrave Town doesn't support freeloaders.\nSib gestured and Claremont bowed in\nobedience. At that moment, he reported\nto Sibbin, \"There is one problem now. It\nseems we are about to run out of money.\"\nThis sentence struck Sibbin like a bolt\nof lightning. He worriedly thought out\nof money already. Sib pondered. A few\ndays ago after the round table\nconference ended, the nobles around\nEagle Crest thief had also left and he\ncouldn't just openly plunder before the\ndemihumans could settle in and\ncontribute. He wouldn't see any return.\nCharity is indeed very expensive.\nSuddenly, a thought flashed through\nSibbon's mind as he thought about\ncharity. Isn't this a charitable cause\nfor the entire thief? There's no reason\nfor the Lord to be the only one\nresponsible, right? Sibbon then ordered\nClaremont, \"Summon all the wealthy\nmerchants in the city for me at 9 a.m.\ntomorrow. I need to have a meeting with\nthem. If anyone doesn't want to come,\nsend that guy to the iron mines.\"\nClaremont immediately followed Sibbon's\ncommand, saying that tomorrow all the\nwealthy merchants of East Grave Town\nwould gather in the castle's conference\nhall on time. outside the castle at this\ntime. The sun was gradually setting,\npainting a corner of the sky orange with\nthe colors of dusk. Sibbon walked\nwearily, yawning as he said, \"Busy all\nday. I can finally get some rest.\" Just\nas he stepped through his room's door,\nhe felt something was wrong. A demihuman\nholding a table lamp rushed to attack\nSibbon from behind. Sibbin thought an\nambush and quickly grabbed the\ndemihuman's hand. The lamp fell and the\ngirl could only scream in pain. Sibbon\nheld both her hands tightly, slamming\nthe demihuman's back hard against the\ndoor behind them and asked, \"It's you.\"\nSibbin's body pressed tightly against\nthe girls. She cried out, \"Let go.\"\nSibbon smiled slightly and said, \"How\nstrange. I brought you here from that\nabusive grand prince's place. Not only\ndo you not thank me,\" he then activated\nthe system to identify her information.\nThe system displayed a small circle over\nSib's eye, analyzing the person opposite\nhim. He asked her instead, \"You repay\nkindness with malice and ambush me.\"\nWhat kind of logic is that? The system\nanalysis provided the information. Name:\nIsilia. Identity: Princess of the Elven\nRoyal Court. Younger sister of the\ncurrent Elven Queen. Strength: Combat\nType: Elven Magus. Level 49-41-50.\nSealed. Skills: Advanced natural\naffinity. Proficient in advanced water\nmagic. Sealed. Proficient in\nintermediate elven magic sealed\ntransformation art nighting gale form\nsealed. Elven signal activated equipment\nLor's maid dress. Reputation with elven\nfaction 15,748.\nShe is a pampered elven princess but to\navenge a friend. She secretly\ninfiltrated the human world. Empire\nreputation one. Only you know her true\nidentity. Sib thought. Great. No wonder\nshe didn't want to reveal her identity.\nThe girl whose hand were held tight\nfrowned angrily and shouted, \"You people\ninvaded my home first. I must kill you\nall.\" Sib yelled at her. \"Is there\nsomething wrong with your head? I don't\neven know where your home is.\" Sibbon\nthought to himself, \"If the Grand Prince\nfound out about this, he would probably\ntie her up directly and send her to the\nJade border as a hostage for the human\nempire's coalition forces to threaten\nthe elven royal court.\" A problematic\nidentity. And she's hostile towards me.\nWhat a hot potato. Sibbon kept one hand\nholding the girl's hands while his other\nhand pointed at her chest. The girl\nblushed and stammered. Sibbin smiled and\nasked, still not convinced. But then he\nnoticed another piece of information,\nthinking, \"I didn't notice it before.\nWhy is this line of text printed in\nred?\" The system screen displayed the\ninformation. \"Elvin signal activated.\"\nSibbon wondered, repeating, \"Elvin\nsignal.\" The girl in front of him was\nsurprised. She asked Sibbin, \"How do you\nknow about that?\" Sibbon froze and\nthought to himself. System quickly tell\nme what an Elven signal is. Judging by\nher reaction, it's definitely not\nsomething good. The system reported the\nresult. The elven signal is a magical\npattern for mutual location tracking\namong elven royalty within a certain\nrange. It was accompanied by an image of\ntwo elves locating each other via a\nsignal between their chests. Sibbon was\nshocked and thought, \"Damn, isn't this a\nliving locator? If there are any elven\nroyalty nearby, they'll come straight\nhere, right? Isn't this more direct than\njust telling people on the lore of Eagle\nCrest? Come and kill me. Sib angrily\nshouted, \"You damn elf. I already told\nyou that you have the wrong target for\nyour revenge, and yet you still\nactivated the elven signal.\" The girl\nalso said loudly, \"I don't know what\nyou're talking about.\" Sibbon spoke\nloudly, but in his head, he thought,\n\"This one is clearly doing it on\npurpose. Asking is useless. What a\nterrible personality.\" The girl glanced\nat Sibbon provocatively. Sibbin, with\nveins popping on his forehead in anger,\nasked the system, \"The Elven signal can\nbe turned off, right?\" The system\nreplied, \"It can, but you need to find\nthe signal's location.\" To avoid\ndetection, the Elven signal is usually\ncarved by L's on the last anterior\nvertebrae or the lower abdomen. After\nactivation, a pattern displaying the\nElven signal will appear. Sibfully tore\nthe dress on the girl and asked, \"Like\nthis?\" The girl blushed and begged,\n\"Don't.\" At this moment, Sibbon found\nthe pattern on her body. It was a small\npink glowing pattern located above her\nnavl. Sibbin held her body tightly,\npointed at the pattern, and said, \"How\ndo I turn it off? Is it a manual\nswitch?\" The girl shouted, \"Stop it.\"\nSuddenly, Lorie walked in from outside.\nSeeing the scene, her face darkened, and\nshe asked, \"Um, master, what are you two\ndoing?\" Both of them were stunned in\nsurprise. Sibbon quickly let go. His\neyes panicked as he asked Lorie, \"When\ndid you get here?\" Lorie calmly replied,\n\"I just arrived. The door wasn't closed,\nso I let myself in.\" Sibon thought back.\n\"The door wasn't closed.\" \"That's right.\nI was ambushed by this stupid elf as\nsoon as I entered.\" Cutting off Sibbon's\nthoughts, Lorie said, \"Master, this\nwon't do. How can you do this kind of\nthing without closing the door?\" Sib\nasked what, and tried to explain to\nLorie, \"It's not what you think. Let me\nexplain.\" Lorie just huffed, her face\nclearly showing her sulkiness. Lorie\npouted, her cheeks puffed up as she\nglared at Sibbon. There's nothing to\nexplain. It is your freedom to choose\nwho warms your bed. Master Lori is just\na maid. I can't meddle in such matters.\nSibbon found her adorable and chuckled\ngleefully. How could that be? To me,\nLorie is of course not just a simple\nmaid. I wasn't trying to do anything. I\njust wanted to turn off the elven beacon\non her abdomen. Lorie stared at her\nabdomen. Elven beacon. The place where\nthe elven beacon is emitted is her\nchest. That's right. That place is used\nto broadcast her location. Seeing this,\nLorie got even angrier. This damn elf.\nYou did it on purpose, didn't you? You\ncould have turned it off earlier or\nlater, but you had to do it now. Her\nelven beacon was already off. She\nstammered under Lorie's questioning, \"I\nI don't know what you're talking about.\"\nShe leaned close to Lor's ear and\nwhispered, \"Please help me. I was just\ndelivering food.\" As soon as I entered\nthe room, my clothes were torn. Hearing\nthis tone, Lorie cursed inwardly, \"Damn\nit, this damned green tea demon.\" The\nlittle girl spoke calmly. \"It's all\nright. You don't have to be afraid. The\nother girl was surprised. Huh? Lorie's\nface darkened, looking dangerous. Master\nis a very good person. He would never\nforce someone to bear his children. The\ngirl was mentally overwhelmed by Lorie\nand could only speak haltingly. Is that\nso? After speaking, Lorie turned to ask\nSibbon, \"Right, master.\" He forced a\nsmile, holding a red pill in his hand.\nOf course. Suddenly, Sibbon shoved the\npill into her mouth. Who would be\ninterested in a damn elf that reeks of\ngreen tea? She was in a passive position\nand had to swallow the pill. Once she\ncollected herself, she turned angrily\ntowards him. \"What did you make me\nswallow?\" Sib's eyes lit up and with\nhands on his hips, he replied gleefully,\n\"Poison, of course.\" \"Look at your arm.\nIsn't it red and swollen?\" \"Indeed,\" she\nlooked at her arm and saw that red\nblotches had appeared on it. \"You really\npoison me?\" Sibbon smirked. \"Only I have\nthe antidote for this poison. If you\ndon't obey, then just wait until your\nwhole body rots and you die.\" Lorie\nasked puzzled master, \"What are you\nplanning to do?\" He explained to the\nlittle girl, \"Lori, she came from the\nGrand Prince's place. She might be up to\nsome tricks. What if she's a spy?\" Lorie\nsuddenly remembered. That being said, it\nwas a bit strange. Back then, when she\ntouched me, a few images appeared in my\nhead. I felt a sudden emotional urge to\nsave her. The girl standing by tried to\nrecall what images. Sib hugged Lorie,\nstroking her head, and asked, \"What kind\nof images?\" Lorie nuzzled into his\nchest. I'm sorry, master. Stupid Lorie\ncan't remember anything after leaving\nthe Grand Prince's place. Otherwise, I\nwould have told you long ago. Sibbon\nkissed the little girl's forehead. Good\ngirl. If you can't remember, then don't.\nYou don't need to blame yourself. For\nnow on, let this elf follow you. Lorie\nobediently replied. Yes, Sibbon\nwhispered in her ear. However, we can't\nlet our guard down. Have Mrs. Tissy make\na custom outfit for her, one that\nexposes the location of the elven\nbeacon. She is only allowed to move\naround on this floor of Mina. He\ninstructed her further. This matter\ncannot be delayed. Lorie, take her to\nchange her clothes now, then go to Mrs.\nTricy's workshop. The clothes must be\nfinished tonight. All right, have Roy go\nwith you. It's getting dark. It's not\nsafe. Yes, master. Then she turned to\nthe other girl and said, \"You follow\nme.\" The girl was very obedient now.\nOkay. She followed behind Lorie and\nasked the little girl, \"Excuse me, that\nday you saw everything, didn't you?\"\nLorie was silent. The girl continued,\n\"Are you an awakened elf? I can feel the\npower of nature on you.\" Lorie could no\nlonger stay silent and spoke up. \"I\ndon't know what you're talking about,\nnor do I know what I saw. I am just the\npersonal maid of the great lord.\" The\ngirl grabbed Lorie's hand. \"Please wait,\nbut you!\" Lorie frowned slightly. \"You\nsaid you were bringing food for the\nmaster, but I don't see any dining\nutensils. Instead, I only saw the broken\nlamp outside the door. Moreover,\nalthough the master hides some things\nfrom me, he has never lied to me.\" Lorie\nyanked her hand away and you saved by us\nyet showing no gratitude are sneaking\naround instead. The girl was startled.\nThat is Lor's face darkened. It was\nbecause I saved the master that he\nbrought you back. Therefore, if you dare\ndo anything detrimental to the master.\nLorie enunciated each word, I will\ndefinitely take responsibility and kill\nyou. Lorie felt unsafe with this strange\nwoman. She stopped and instructed her,\n\"You wait here for me a moment.\" For the\nyoung girl, it was better to be wary of\nthis elf. That elf had become much more\nobedient ever since being poisoned by\nSibbon. Upon hearing the girl's words,\nshe only replied softly. \"All right.\"\nLorie thought to herself, \"What's this\nabout the noble elf acting all friendly\nwith me?\" \"But the master has saved so\nmany people. I've never seen him so wary\nof anyone like this. I shouldn't have\nsaid I wanted to save her.\" \"That's\nright. I'd better say.\" Lorie stood\nbefore Royy's room and knocked. \"Roy,\nare you in there?\" Lorie was a little\njealous. He treated this saintist too\nwell. Roy had just finished bathing,\nstill wrapped in a towel as she came\nout. Lori, what is it? Is something the\nmatter with Lord Heavy? Lorie lowered\nher face, looking more pensive than\nusual. That's right. The master told me\nto go with you and this elf to Mrs.\nChrissy's place. Roy was quick. Is that\nso? Wait for me to change my clothes and\nI'll be right there. Lorie stopped her.\nI told her to wait over there. There's\nsomething I want to ask you. Roy, you\nLorie hesitated. Then her expression\nturned serious, her cheeks flushed,\nasking Roy, \"You like the master, don't\nyou?\" Roy was a bit surprised by this\nquestion. So she answered haltingly, \"I\nI really do like Lord Heavy Very much.\nBut this is because Lorie didn't wait\nfor Roy to finish and continued her\nsentence.\" Because of the dreamscape,\nright? After you returned from the\ndreamscape, your attitude towards the\nmaster completely changed. Lorie moved\nher face close to Royy's. What exactly\ndid you see in the nightmare to be so\nunforgettable about the master? Roy\nsighed. Actually, it's not just because\nof that dreamscape, but how could she\npossibly say these things? Thinking\nthis, Roy ignored Lor's interrogation\nand calmly replied, \"These things have\nnothing to do with you.\" Lori beside her\nwas completely shocked. Lorie shily\ndeclared, \"Anyway, the one who will have\nthe master's child is me.\" Roy broke out\nin a cold sweat. \"Have you two already\nreached that stage in your\nrelationship?\" Lorie fought back\npossessively. In short, it's already\nreserved. Roy said seriously. Then\ndoesn't that mean nothing has happened\nyet? Roy was as happy as if she'd won\nthe lottery. That's right. I know Lord\nHeavy and Lorie are very close, but\nnothing has happened between them yet.\nFrom childhood until now, I have lived\nfor the church. I've never had anything\nthat belonged to me. Roy looked up at\nthe starry sky. All the pent up\nfrustration she felt. Now she would be\ndetermined to fight back for this one\ntime only. Now that I finally have a\npiece of affection that belongs to me,\nam I really willing to let it just die\nsilently like this? Or not? Lorie was\nannoyed and said loudly, \"So, what is it\nthat you want?\" Roy restrained herself,\n\"Don't stay calm, Roy.\" Roy suddenly\nplaced a hand on Lorie's cheek. \"Then\nthat's really unfair. I saw Lord heavy\nkiss you like that. You two have kissed\nmany times, haven't you?\" Royy's face\nwas beat red. This time, it was her turn\nto overwhelm Lorie. Didn't you ask me\nwhat happened during the nightmare? Lori\nin a nightmare. Lord, heavy and I\nexercise 17,395\ntimes to have a baby. Lori felt a pain\nin her heart. Tears welling up. What?\nThis isn't fair. Roy provoked her\nfurther. That's right. It's extremely\nunfair that in reality, you're the only\none he has ever kissed. I want to have a\ngood taste of the places he has kissed\nto. Roy angrily grabbed Lorie's hand as\nshe tried to run. Lorie tried to run but\nwas stopped. Are you out of your mind?\nLorie didn't want this. Roy became even\nmore determined. Don't even think about\nescaping. It's true that when women get\njealous, they could do anything they\nwant. Roy panted. Where else did he kiss\nyou? Your neck. Wait, wait a minute. Roy\nkissed Lorie's neck, making the girl\nscream. My master, help. There's a\npervert here. Sib, who was reading\ndocuments in his office, had a\npremonition. Why does that sound like\nLor's voice? But that's impossible. This\nfloor uses the best soundproofing\nmaterials. It must be because there's\nbeen too much going on lately. I must\nhave misheard. Roy then grabbed Lor's\ntail. He must touch her tail often too,\nright? Lorie screamed helplessly,\nmaster. Both of them were embarrassed,\nbut their jealousy made them unwilling\nto back down. The pile of documents was\nstacked high on Sibbon's desk. He placed\nthe last sheet on the stack, breathing a\nsigh of relief. It's finally done. He\nstretched tiredly. Ah, I'm dead tired.\nOne more group of people means 10 times\nmore work. Sib happily realized, but now\nit's time to rest. Come on, system. I\nwant to do a lottery draw. System\nactivated. Ding. Detected that the daily\nderivative quest has been completed. The\nmain story quest has been completed.\nObtained one chain of fate. Below is the\nquest reward the host has drawn. Ding.\nobtaining the troop. Undead corpse\nshaman x20. Ding. This reward is a\njackpot. Obtain the troop. Terror\nwraiths x10. Sib was happy and\nsatisfied. Not bad. A jackpot. The\nsystem announced the reward is being\ndeployed in a reasonable manner. Please\nprepare well host. This time Sib asked\ncarefully. Wait. Reasonable in what\nsense? What I need to prepare for? Don't\ntell me it's big rocks falling from the\nsky again. This time plumes of purple\nsmoke suddenly appeared on the screen.\nThey began to spread throughout Sibbon's\nroom. What's this commotion? The smoke?\nIt's black. That smoke began to solidify\ninto a shape. It seemed to be an\nextremely large object. Sib only came up\nto the elbow of this object. This is an\nundead knight. System display name,\nterror wraiths. Idi undead strength sky\nknight LV 51 51 to 60. Skills undead\nphysique passive one hit kill reanimate\nnightmares advent passive. Equipment\ndreadnots's heavy armor master exclusive\nto undead.

Undead physique, immune to\nmental magic and poison, increases\ndamage to the light system by 30,\nreduces physical damage by 30.

The greater the\nlevel difference compared to the terror\nwraiths, the lower the probability.\nReanimate after being killed for the\nfirst time, may have a chance to revive\nagain. Reputation: Undead physique. No.\nColonial empire reputation one. Sibbon\nmarveled at this reward. such strong\ncombat power. These are definitely not\nthe undead knights of the Keon\ncontinent. The undead knights of the\nKeon continent are not this robust.\nThey're just a horse skeleton. He\nscrambled to think, \"No, right now I\nshould be thinking about the arrangement\nproblem first.\" With a bunch of these\nundead things suddenly appearing, how am\nI supposed to explain this to the\noutside world? The Minotaur from before\ncould be said to be an invited guest.\nThe hellfire could be said to be a\nconstruct. What should I say about the\nundead now? A human lord recruiting\nundead. This isn't very reasonable. If\nthe Church of Light, which fights undead\nday in and day out, finds out, \"I'm\nafraid it won't be good. I'm afraid\nthey'll immediately dispatch a team of\nangels to fly here and chop me in half.\"\nThe thought sent a chill down Sibbon's\nspine. He stared at this problematic\nreward. What to do? Except for the\nundead horse, which looks obvious. A\nknight wearing such a full set of heavy\narmor would be hard to identify as an\nundead creature. If the waror of the\nterror wraiths was covered in a set of\n360\u00b0ree\nno blind spot armor, then as for the\nrotten breath of the undead, as long as\nit's not someone from the church of\nlight, they probably won't be able to\ndetect it. He instructed the undead\nknights before the battle armor is\nforged. Everyone will have to stay in\nthe warehouse for now. Don't make any\nnoise. Understood. He left the office.\nThat's settled for now. Time to go back\nand sleep. Huh? In front of the door was\na familiar figure appeared. Lori, what's\nwrong with you? Why aren't you going in?\nLorie turned to look at him, her eyes\nwelling with tears. Master. Lorie blamed\nhim. Master is so mean. Obviously.\nObviously. Lori came first. Why did you\nhave a baby with Roy over 20,000 times,\ntoo? Sib's dirty mind immediately\nstarted racing. Is what you're saying\nwhat I'm thinking? There's something\nthat good? How come I didn't know? Lorie\nagrevedly pushed her hair aside to show\nhim the hickey Roy left. She's not a\ngood woman, master. Look at this. What\ndid she do to me just now? Sibbon\nimmediately thought of a steamy scene\nbetween these two lovely girls. What I'm\nimagining is wrong. Sibbon chuckled with\ndelight. Lori, did you drink with Roy\njust now? You can't drink yet. Lorie was\ngenuinely angry now. Uh, master, really?\nI didn't drink. Lorie hugged Sibbon\ntightly, sobbing continuously as she\nexplained, \"That woman in the dream,\ninfluenced by the aura on master's body,\nfantasized a master.\" In the dream, she\nfell in love with a master 1,000 times.\nand then and then then sobb hearing her\nstory made him sweat profusely as he\nunderstood with relief. So was in a\ndream. However, he couldn't bear to see\nher cry like this. So he comforted her,\n\"Don't be sad. Those 20,000 times were\nall fake. If your heartbroken, let's\nhave one now.\" Hearing this, she looked\nup and asked, \"Really?\" A tear drop\nstill clung to the corner of her eye.\nHer face flushed from crying so much as\nshe hugged him tightly. Ah. Next, she\nwas so happy that she directly pushed\nhim down onto the floor, still in\ndisbelief. Master, can we really have a\nbaby just by hugging like this? I always\nfeel like something's not right. Master\nisn't tricking Lorie, is he? Lor's\nchildish reaction made him find it funny\nas he patted her head. Of course not.\nEven if you go ask Mrs. Chrissy, she\nwould also tell you. This way, you can\nhave a baby. All right, go to sleep\nearly now. Sleeping early and waking up\nearly helps with having a baby. With no\nother choice, she had to obey him.\nSibbon lay on the bed with his arm\nbehind his head. Although he said\nnothing, his mind was filled with\nthoughts. Lorie's body is still weak.\nShe can't give birth and use healing\nmagic at the same time. But healing\nmagic can't reduce the suffering and\nfatigue on her body. Let's wait longer.\nOver on this side, Roy was wearing a\ncomfortable set of pajamas, her long\ntail exposed behind her as she knelled\non the ground doing something there.\nSuddenly, while lying quietly, he was\ntightly bound by something, causing his\nface to break out in a sweat as he\nopened his eyes to look. As soon as he\nopened his eyes, he saw Roy sitting and\nsmiling to one side, and his neck was\nbeing wrapped by her tail, making his\nface flush red. Roy. Next, she leaned in\nand blew a breath into his ear,\nwhispering, \"Love me, won't you?\"\nWithout waiting for him to react, she\nthen pushed him down and sat on top of\nhim. \"You must really like this spot,\nright?\" The hand she was holding tightly\nwas brought close to his rear, making\nhis nose bleed. He was panicking inside.\nHe was about to die. According to the\nplot, on the second day, news would\nspread that he had molested the saints.\nThen it would lead to the ending of\nbeing castrated. No, right now, the most\nimportant thing is to survive. It's\nbetter to pretend to be asleep. So, he\ndecided to act and pretend to fall dead\nasleep, ignoring her frantic calls. Lord\nSibbon, hey, wake up. However, this act\ndid not deceive Ruer, but instead\nangered her. Pretending to be asleep,\nare you? Suddenly, Lori, lying next to\nhim, breathed into his ear. Master, just\nthis made Sibbon's face turn as red as\nif it were about to explode. But he\nstill had to bite his lip to not reveal\nthat he was faking sleep before Lorie\ncame to see him. It turned out she had\ngone to see her first and proposed. Do\nyou want to let Lord Sibon and you have\na baby? Let's just cooperate. In the\nend, the two of them held hands\nintimately and agreed deal in the\nconference hall of Eagle Crest Castle.\nEveryone had gathered inside, but they\nwere all whispering, not knowing why\nthey have been summoned here. Does\nanyone know why the Lord of Eagle Crest\nsummoned us here? Victor, you've been in\nEagle Crest city for so long. Haven't\nyou heard any information? I feel it's\nvery likely he wants to raise taxes. As\nthey were discussing, the door suddenly\nopened. Sibbon walked in with the whites\nof his eyes showing and a lifeless face.\nIn contrast to him, Lori and Rueer on\neither side had cheerful faces full of\nvitality. Seeing them made everyone\nwhisper even more. I heard the Lord has\nbeen indulging in women lately. Even in\na situation like this, he brings two\npeople with him. It must be true. That\ntired look, he must have been with him\nday and night. He looked at the two\ngirls sticking to him like glue with his\ndark circled eyes, feeling helpless. He\ncouldn't refute it. Although it felt\nless like he was playing and more like\nhe was being played by them all night.\nThey thought he couldn't hear and\ncontinued to whisper among themselves.\nThe Lord is taking in so many people\nlike that. Does he want to start a human\nslave business with us? By now he was\ngetting irritable and spoke up if\neveryone has arrived. Let's get to the\nmain topic. He thought unhappily. Stop\nguessing randomly. So he began to speak.\nI have summoned you all today mainly for\ntwo matters. The first matter is to\nrecommend a product produced by Eagle\nCrest Castle itself. Perfume. Hearing\nthat, Ruer smiled and held up a box.\nOpening it. Inside the box was a\nbeautiful small pinkish purple bottle.\nWhen the bottle was uncapped, he told\nthem, \"Everyone, you could take a look.\nDoes it have brand value?\" The fragrance\nwafting from the bottle made everyone\nexcitedly take deep breaths. Oh, this\nscent is so soothing to the soul. Just\none sniff gave Victor the illusion that\nhe was blissfully holding two beautiful\nwomen in his arms. I have never smelled\nsuch a special fragrance. It's like\nbeing in a sea of lavender. A young\nwoman past 18. This made him not\nhesitate to discuss with him. Lord,\nVictor is willing to sell this perfume\nfor you. It will bring immense wealth to\nthe Eagle Crest territory. I can even do\nit without taking a profit. That\ncondition made him smile happily. Is\nthat so? However, someone else's voice\nrang out, interrupting the conversation.\nVictor, wait a minute. Their faces were\nall filled with desire as they rushed\nforward, determined to fight for it.\nLord, I can also open a sales channel\nfor you. And I have connections with Men\nPark. Lord, I also The chaotic scene\nmade Sibbon speak up to calm them down.\nAll right. All right. Everyone calm down\nand sit down first. He glanced at the\nbeautiful Lorie standing behind him and\ntold them mysteriously, \"I know you all\nwant to get the rights to sell the\nperfume, but today I want to use a new\nmethod to cooperate with you, ensuring\nthat every one of you can get the rights\nto sell the perfume.\" Her hand holding a\nscroll, she smiled and walked over to\ngive it to Victor. Please take this. He\nwas a bit puzzled by this. What is this?\nSeeing this, he explained, \"On this\nparchment is the cooperation method I\nhave prepared for you. Please look at it\ncarefully. If you have any questions,\nyou can ask. Inside the scroll was the\nperfume authorization plan with each\ncondition clearly written. Merchants are\ndivided into one to five stars. All\nmerchants attending this meeting are\nautomatically upgraded to one-star\nmerchants. One-star merchants can have\nfive of the perfume sales rights. This\nfive is divided equally among all-star\nmerchants. Two star merchants can have\n15 of the perfume sales rights. also\ndivided equally among all twostar\nmerchants. Similarly, three stars\ncorrespond to 20 sales rights, four\nstars to 25 sales rights, and five stars\nto 35 sales rights. Benefits: One star\nmerchants get a two tax reduction, two\nstar merchants get a four reduction, and\nso on with fivestar merchants getting a\n10 tax reduction. They all focused on\nreading every word of this long plan\ncarefully. This also means that the\nhigher the star level, the higher the\nproportion, the more profit. And there's\nalso a tax exemption. Being so engrossed\nin reading, they didn't notice Sibbon\nsmirking slightly on the side. That's\nright. This is the famous thing from my\nprevious world. It's the recharge\nsystem. Remembering how his own pitiful\nmoney just vanished in a thin air made\nhis heart ache non-stop. I too was\ngradually fleeced by these inscrupulous\nmerchants. Although he was smiling on\nthe outside, inside he had laid out a\ncunning plan. Now it's your turn,\nmerchants. Time to recharge. One of them\nasked loudly, \"Lord, may I ask how one\ncan become a high star merchant?\" Sibon\nreplied, \"Wanting to become a high star\nmerchant is actually very simple. Just\nbuy a membership.\" The answer confused\nVictor. \"By a membership?\" Seeing he\ndidn't understand, he patiently\nexplained, \"That's right. Buy a\nmembership. By the corresponding\nmembership, and you will immediately\nbecome a merchant of that star level.\nFor just 10,000 gold, you can have a\nstatus of a five-star merchant for a\nwhole year. Although it seems like a\nlot, on average it's only a little over\n800 gold per month. For example, he\nmight feel that 10,000 gold is a lot,\nbut when converted to 800, it's small\nmoney. The cost of this perfume is 100\ngold per bottle. You can buy it from me\nfor 120 gold and sell it in the royal\ncapital. Even if you pay an 800 gold\nmembership fee each month, the profit is\nstill very substantial. Moreover, I can\nalso give five-star merchants a 10 tax\nreduction. A box containing a gold medal\nwas presented to him. Then,\ncongratulations, Mr. Victor, on becoming\nthe first five-star merchant of the\nEagle Crest territory. This is your\nmedal. Seeing the treatment he received,\neveryone else started to get restless.\nLord, I want to become a three-star\nmerchant. Lord, my name is Come on. I\nwant to be a four-star merchant. Lord, I\ndon't have much money, so I can only\napply to be a twostar merchant. The\ncrowd's reaction made Sibbon extremely\nexcited. No problem. Everyone should act\nwithin their means. In his head, he\ncouldn't help but curse by it, you fresh\nsprouts. Outside, there was a beautiful\nclear blue lake with a mermaid happily\nswimming around while Sarakin sat\nsilently in the middle. When she\nsurfaced, the water rippled and\naccidentally splashed on a Seraken,\ncausing him to turn and look. Suddenly,\nhe flew into a rage and rushed over to\nscold her. Damn it, you splashed water\non the great Suriken's body again. You\ndamn fishworm. She was startled and\ntried to explain, \"Oh, sorry, flaming\nrock. I forgot you hate water. I'm just\nso forgetful.\" However, not only did he\nnot calm down, but he became even more\nagitated, just standing there shouting\nloudly, \"Fishworm! Fishworm! No! Why is\nthere a fishworm in my territory?\"\nignoring his anger, Tinh High fearlessly\nswam over to chat. \"By the way, Big\nRock, what do you do for a living?\" But\nhe still didn't like her at all. Enough.\nThe great Sarakin does not want to talk\nto you. I have told you about my\nbackground 57 times already. This is now\nthe 58th time you've asked me. The three\nof them walked over together. Seeing the\ntwo of them ahead, Sibbon spoke up. It\nseems you two are getting along quite\nwell. As soon as he saw him, he hardly\nbowed. Worm, great lord. Sakin greets\nyou. Her face was blank with confusion.\nWho is that? Hearing this, he was\nsurprised by her phenomenal memory.\nYou've even forgotten the lord of this\nplace. Hearing that, she smiled\nbrightly, finally remembering. Ah,\nthat's right. Hello. Hello, Lord. And\nyour highness the saint is too. The\nthree of them smiled and greeted her. He\ncheerfully checked on them both. When\nthe hospital is not open, Sarakin has\nreturned here. Has he? Bon Bong. How are\nyou feeling today? She swam closer to\nhim and replied, \"I feel great. My head\nis very clear.\" But behind her, he\nsilently cursed in his heart. Liar. He\ncouldn't know his inner thoughts.\nHearing what she said, he felt more at\nease. Then let's try to perceive again\ntoday. By the way, tell me, what did you\nperceive? His large, warm hand placed on\nher head made her squint her eyes in\ncomfort. Her large round eyes opened as\nshe recounted the deep sea. I saw the\nendless deep sea. Ferocious schools of\nfish, a whale that sank and died at the\nbottom of the sea. Her face showed a\nlook of loneliness as she clased her\nhands tightly. she continued. A\nfisherman returning from across the sea,\nwalking towards me. He is my father,\nfather. At this point, her eyes widened\nagain, her voice trembling slightly. He\nsaid, \"Tin high. Run away quickly. Don't\nawaken. Don't become a vessel of God.\nForget, forget it.\" As soon as she\nfinished speaking, she fell backward,\nsplashing water everywhere. He had to\nquickly reach out and catch her to keep\nher from sinking. It's a success.\nAnother aarent her information also\nappeared. Nim thing hai all bong bong.\nIdentity presider of the crystal palace\nof the demihuman royal court but\ndeposed. Strength awakened demihuman.\nStage one level 41 41 to 50. Skills\ninclude highle water element affinity\npassive tsunami induction storm\ninduction. Whirlpool water gentle as\njade passive memory imprint ceiling\nblade. No equipment. Demihuman faction\nreputation 238. Presider of the Crystal\nPalace. But now hardly anyone knows of\nher. Colonial Empire reputation one.\nOnly you know her true identity. Seeing\nher faint made him confused. Why did\nBomb Bong faint? Seeing Ru step forward\nto help her up. He also guessed that she\nprobably just fainted because\nsuccessfully awakening consumed too much\nof her stamina. A little rest should be\nenough. The thoughts flooding his mind\nleft Sibbin a bit bewildered. Just now\nwhen Bon Bong awakened, she mentioned\nbeing a vessel of God. Does that refer\nto the sleeping gods in Ragnat who are\nabout to awaken? But why would they want\nto borrow the bodies of demihumans to\nawaken? Lorie walked over a little\nworried and asked, \"Master, do you need\nLori to heal her?\" But he smiled and\nrefused. \"No need, just let her be.\"\nSuddenly, he realized something. That's\nright. It's divinity. Gods cannot enter\nthe main material plane like the can\ncontinent to move around. They're\nrepelled to their own divine kingdoms.\nBut in order to compete for faith to\nenhance the divine power, they must\ndevise all sorts of methods to descend\nto the main material plane. And\nmoreover, demihumans with divinity serve\nas the medium for this. Initially,\nBishop Anna in the demihuman paradise\nalso mentioned the word vessel. So,\nawakened demihumans are premium vessels.\nFurthermore, the divinity they possess\nis extremely abundant, aligning with the\nrules of various godheads. for example,\ntime, life, or the power of the ocean.\nNo wonder they want to launch a god war.\nNo wonder they had to attack the\ndemihuman kingdom. It turns out it was\nall to steal divinity and perfect their\ngodheads. The two girls came forward to\nsupport Tinh High. Does she have to be\nsoaked in water? She is a mermaid after\nall, so she would recover faster that\nway. He was now completely immersed in\nhis thoughts. If his speculation holds\ntrue, then awakenable demihumans will\nbecome absolutely fewer and rarer. By\nthen, more powerful forces will emerge\nto snatch these vessels. Seeing him\nstanding completely still made Lorie\nwalk over in confusion, \"Master, what's\nwrong?\" Only then did he snap back to\nhis senses and reply, \"hm, it's nothing.\nI was just wondering when Bon Bong will\nwake up.\" Rui hugged one of his arms\ntightly, bringing her face close, which\nmade his cheeks flush red with\nembarrassment. She's sleeping very\nsoundly. It might be until tomorrow.\nSeeing this, she cried out in annoyance.\nLorie argued like a child who had her\ntoys snatched away. Rueer, you're not\nallowed to snatch him and run away. Her\nattitude annoyed Ruer, who retorted,\n\"You're the one who's like that. We said\nwe'd cooperate, but you always want to\nhave him all to yourself.\" His words\nmade him go blank for a moment. turning\nto look at both of them and asking,\n\"What are you two talking about? What\ncooperation?\" Rui's face turned red and\nshe refused to answer. \"Men shouldn't\nask about this kind of thing.\" The reply\nmade him feel helpless. \"Uh uh, but it's\nclearly related to me, isn't it?\" But\nLorie shouted, \"Even so, you're not\nallowed to ask. He silently resolved in\nhis heart. Whatever the god's purpose\nfor returning is, whether good or bad, I\nwill not allow their bodies to become\nawakening vessels.\" Suddenly, the system\nappeared. Ding. The system store has\nupdated the level two military barracks\narchitecture. Host, please inspect.\nSibbon's expression turned a bit serious\nas he said, \"Inspect.\" Upon hearing\nthat, a notification panel appeared.\nLevel two military barracks architecture\nlist. Hermitage buildable. Can recruit\nsoldiers, priests, requires 40,000\nvillain points to exchange. Condition\nmust also be met. Possess a human\nterritory. Details. After building the\nhermitage, priests can be recruited for\n400 villain points, five gold coins, and\nfive mithril. Note, recruited priests\nare considered system soldiers, will be\ncompletely subservient to the host, and\nAfter reading, he stroked his chin with\na pensive look. A level two military\nbarracks architecture is only 40,000\npoints. I'm someone with a six-f\nfigureure villain point total. Ruer and\nLor's strange behavior also made him\nspeculate. During the defensive battle\nof Lambdong City before, with Lor's\ncoordination, I earned a lot of villain\npoints, including the villain points I\ngot when Ruer and Lorie got into the\nblanket last night. Ignoring the two\ngirls who were still arguing heatedly on\nthe side, he focused on planning. Well,\nit seems I'll have to have them trouble\nthemselves to get into the blanket more\noften in the future. Getting in once is\n5,000. The two of them together is\n10,000. As long as they get into the\nblanket, once every day, sooner or\nlater, there will be a day I can level\nthe continent. An image of the beautiful\nLori appeared in his mind. Right now,\nalthough I have the super nanny Lori,\nI'm actually still lacking support type\nand healing type units. Priests, they\nseem to be a healing type troop similar\nto pastors. Exchanging for the hermitage\nis not a bad choice. Therefore, he made\na decision and said to the system,\nexchange for the hermitage. As for the\nconstruction site, put it next to the\nguard post. The system received a\ncommand and sent a notification. Ding.\nThe hermedage has been completely built.\nHost, please proceed to the front to\ninspect. That swift action made him\nextremely satisfied. The systems\nefficiency is really fast. Then Sib\nturned around, waved his hand, and said,\n\"If you two continue to argue, I'll go\nto the castle's flower garden by\nmyself.\" Although they were arguing, as\nsoon as they heard that, they both\nturned and loudly stopped him. You\ncan't. Their reaction startled him,\nmaking him jump at the castle's flower\ngarden. His attention was drawn to\nsomething hanging in front of the door.\nAfter he put a bag full of gold coins\ninto it, that thing immediately emitted\na sound. System recruit 10 priests.\nPriest, the official title of a Catholic\nclergyman, also called a celebrate. tall\nmen suddenly appeared and shouted in\nunison, \"My lord, may the glory of the\ngods accompany you.\" Looking at the tall\nman standing imposingly like a statue in\nfront of him made him gasp in\nastonishment. This physique and these\nmuscles, he looks so robust. They even\nhave metal scepters taller than they\nare. Is this really a support type unit?\nThis person's information panel\nappeared. Name: Sigma, identity, priest,\nstrength, level 30, fanatic, 21 to 40.\nSkills: Sacred Guardian shield,\ncleansing aura, holy healing art, fierce\nattack. Equipment: self-discipline robe,\nfine. Heavy self-discipline scepter,\nfine. Reputation: Eagle Crest territory,\na powerful battle pastor. Fanatics,\ntheir core spirit is to use punishment\nin place of preaching. Not only can they\nprotect themselves on a battlefield, but\nthey also shoulder the important task of\nprotecting their allies. Now under the\nguidance of the gods, they are ready to\nbecome a sturdy shield in your hands.\nReading has made him break out in a cold\nsweat because of how doineering they\nwere using punishment in place of\npreaching too. Very well. This is a\nbattle pastor, right? Directly\ndelivering physical salvation. Sibbon\ncleared his throat a few times, his face\nslightly displeased system. I remember\ncompleting the humiliate the saintest\nmission last night. I should have\nanother lottery draw. Be a little more\nproactive next time. Don't always make\nme remind you. Only after hearing that\ndid the system dain to appear. Verified\nthat you completed the humiliate the\nsest mission last night, obtaining one\nspecial lottery draw. Commencing the\ndraw for the host. Next, the system\ncontinuously displayed notifications.\nLottery draw complete. Congratulations\nto the host for obtaining a mysterious\ncrystal fragment and a mysterious egg.\n1/1. Reward distribution complete. The\nmysterious egg has been automatically\nplaced in the host's room. Please go and\ninspect. After reading, he complained\nannoyance. Why is everything so\nmysterious? Suddenly, a blue spirit\nstone appeared. Taking it in his hand,\nsurprised Sibbon. Is this the mysterious\ncrystal fragment? I get the feeling the\nsystem just took it from somewhere. Over\non this side, a piece of someone's\npendant cracked. Yow saw it and was\nstartled. Small blue frames appeared\naround him. numerously. Seeing this,\nsomeone shouted loudly, \"What is this?\nI'm being forcibly logged off.\" In front\nof everyone, a system notification\nwindow appeared. \"Game temporarily\nupdating.\" Seeing this, they all started\nmaking a commotion. The game is\nupdating. The announcement continued to\nappear to further enhance the player\nexperience. 500 slots to join the Eagle\nCrest Territory faction have now been\nopened exclusively for new players with\nnew professions to choose from. Hello,\nwelcome. Now everyone was in an uproar.\nWhat? You can even join the villain\nfaction? Could it be because of the\nforced log off just now? The bright\nsunlight shining down on the city made\nthe place even more radiant. A young man\nstretched, his face full of excitement.\nThis time I finally got a slot for the\ngame. The villain faction is so cool.\nThe young man in armor standing next to\nhim was also happy. So this is Lambdong\nCity. It's much better than in Kuang\nTown. over here. A short-haired girl\nwith two small ears on her head saw the\nyoung man in front of her and was\noverjoyed. Ah, brother on. The young man\nwith a tail behind him looked at her\nwith endless joy. Little my DOA. In the\ndistance, another young man was also\nsmiling as he watched them. Are all the\ndemihumans over here? Suddenly, a hand\nplaced on her head reminded her, \"You\nlittle rascal, if you want to have a\nreunion, wait a little longer. Lead the\npeople to the square for me first.\" She\nhad no choice but to obey. When Sibbin,\nRuer, and Lorie walked over, the\nsoldiers automatically formed ranks,\ncreating an open path for them. Everyone\naround saw this and started chattering\nexcitedly. Behind him are two gorgeous\nfurry girls. Isn't that our saintest\nrule? The other one is the maid Lorie,\nright? I saw her during the attack on\nthe city last time. My DOA walked at the\nfront and said loudly, \"Brothers and\nsisters on Lynn, come this way.\" The man\nstanding above reminded them, \"Everyone\nbe silent.\" When he had stepped up, he\nturned to look at everyone below and\nintroduced himself. Welcome you\notherworlders to the heart of Eagle\nCrest Territory, Lambdong City. I am the\nhead of Eagle Crest Territory, your old\nacquaintance, the Eagle Crest Count, or\nthe Golden Lion. His voice rang out\nloudly. I have some good news to tell\nyou all. A war is about to begin. This\nbattle will start from the colonial\nempire and spread to every corner of the\nking continent. In the days to come, you\nwill all participate in this battle\nunder my rule, and you will witness the\nrebirth of blood and fire here.\nOverthrow the corrupt dynasty build a\nnew order. After hearing this, everyone\nlooked at each other in confusion. Is\nthis a newly updated storyline? A\nlarge-scale world quest? At this point,\nhis face showed a radiant confidence.\nEveryone, it could be said that you are\nall extremely lucky because you were\nsummoned to Eagle Crest territory. You\nwill soon along with me bloodwash this\nworld after hearing this. Everyone's\nface broke into a bright smile feeling\nincredibly excited. Wreck the world with\nthe villain. 1,000 likes. Bloodwash.\nBloodwash. Bloodwash. Lord Eagle Crest\nis amazing. This is great. From now on,\nwe won't be beaten back to level zero by\nLord Eagle Crest anymore. Standing\nbefore everyone's cheers filled his\nheart with satisfaction. Being able to\nsnatch a group of players before the\ngreat war begins. I'm also very lucky.\nAlthough I was almost sidetracked by\nbeauty. This all goes back to an hour\nago. Sibbon held the string with a\nbeautiful blue spirit stone and offered\nit. Here, Lori, this is for you. Seeing\nthat made Ruer's face flush red with\nembarrassment. Is that for me? Her eyes\nwelled up with emotion. This is the\nfirst time anyone has ever given me a\ngift. He looked at her, smiled, and\npraised. It's beautiful. In his head, he\nthought, \"I don't even know what this\ncrystal fragment I got from the lottery\ndoes. Do I have to collect a full set to\nsummon a divine dragon?\" Hearing this,\nthe system explained, \"This mysterious\ncrystal fragment is a part of the rain\ngod's divinity. Possessing it will grant\nthe host the ability to recruit\nplayers.\" The news struck him like a\nlightning bolt, leaving his whole body\nfrozen like a statue. Oh crap. Why\ndidn't you say something so important\nsooner? The notification board continued\nto reply. However, most of the authority\nis still in Yeha's hands. You only have\na portion of the authority. She had just\nreplied, \"Thank you, my lord. I will\ntake good care of it.\" When he suddenly\nacted overly frantic, panically reaching\nfor her chest, which surprised her,\n\"Wait, Rue.\" Looking closely, he saw it.\nThere was a crack on this crystal\nfragment. Her face turned as red as a\nripe tomato, and she turned her head,\nnot daring to look at him. It's okay. As\nlong as it's from you, I want it. Her\nreaction made his whole body feel like\nit was steaming. How can you say such\nthings in this position? Next, he\nbrazenly pulled her into his arms and\nwhispered, \"The first gift you receive\nshouldn't have any flaws. I will find a\nmost perfect gem to give you.\" As for\nthis fragment, let me take it back for\nnow. She was completely taken in by his\nsweet words and her bright smile only\nmade him feel worse about himself.\nAlthough I feel very bad for Ruer. This\nis a very important item. Moreover, it's\nsomething that Guy Yiha once possessed,\nso I can't let it stay on Ruer. Watching\nthe two of them being so intimate. Lorie\nfrowned and thought to herself, \"The\natmosphere between Master and Ruer is\nvery strange.\" While I was looking for\nMiss Chrissy, could Ruer have been doing\nsomething sneaky behind my back? Back in\nreality, Sibbon continued his speech to\nlive in Lambdong City. Rules are\nextremely important. Next, I will have\nsomeone lead you all to familiarize\nyourselves with the inner city and at\nthe same time tell you what you should\ndo and we'll get you killed if you so\nmuch as touch it. As you have all seen,\nLambdong City recently had a large\ninflux of demihumans. Immigrate here.\nTherefore, the fastest leveling tasks\nright now are mining ore, chopping\ntrees, and building houses. There's also\na large area in Lambdong City with\ndilapidated tiled houses. Your mission\nis to renovate these places. Hearing\nthis, they became more curious, feeling\nas if they had suddenly been thrown into\na simulation management game. I think\nthis is pretty cool. The quests are\nhere. The moment they saw the board\nallowing them to change job classes,\nthey were stunned. Oh my god, there are\nso many. It included five different job\nclasses. swordsman, knight, divine\narcher, crusader, priest, and all of\nthem required level 10. He continued,\n\"In short, try your best to level up to\nlevel 10, then come find me, and I will\nhandle your job class change.\" But they\nwere no longer listening to him because\neveryone had erupted into a noisy\nclamor. Five job classes, a full five\njob classes. The protagonist side over\nthere only has warrior and mage. Nobody\nbetter stop me. I'm gonna chop down\nevery tree in Lambdong City. Mining\nGore, mining gore, building houses,\nbuilding houses. Their reaction made\nSibbon extremely satisfied. Excellent. I\nthought I'd have to waste more breath,\nbut I didn't expect these players to not\neven see themselves as human, being so\nproactive. It wasn't until he returned\nto his room and sat down on a chair to\nrest that Sibbon let out a tired sigh.\nPhew, these players are so much trouble.\nIt's a real headache. Now I can finally\nrest. Suddenly, a girl in a red dress\nwith a chain on her leg walked in, but\nsince his eyes were closed, he couldn't\nsee who it was. Oh well, I won't think\nabout it anymore. This led him to\nmistakenly call out, \"Lori, pour me a\nglass of water.\" The girl's outfit was\nrather revealing and didn't do much to\nhide her huge chest. The girl said\nnothing and just gently handed him the\nglass of water. He took it and had a\nsip. Thanks, but why does the tea taste\ndifferent today? Seeing that the person\nin the room didn't answer, he opened his\neyes to look. The sight made him spit\nthe water out of his mouth in shock.\nUnlucky Iscelia took the full force of\nthat spray, leaving her drenched and\nshivering. He felt puzzled. \"Icelia, why\nare you here and dress like this?\" Her\nface flushed red as she replied, \"Lady\nLorie told me to change and then wait\nfor her here. Besides, it was you,\nmaster, who told me to dress like this.\"\nHer answer left him helpless. I I just\nneeded the spirit mark on your abdomen\nto be visible. I didn't expect that when\nit comes to costume design, Miss Chrissy\nwould have such unique ideas. The\nperverted him couldn't help but imagine\nLorie and Rule also wearing such skimpy\noutfits. Charmingly calling out,\n\"Master, he just as he was thinking\nabout it, the two of them entered.\"\nLorie smiled and announced, \"Master,\nwe're back. Those otherworlders have\nbeen properly settled.\" Seeing Iselia\nstanding in the room startled her. Why\nare you here? Didn't I tell you to stay\nin the first floor corridor? Probably\nout of fear. Her whole body trembled\nslightly. I I'm sorry, Lady Lorie. I\nheard master say he wanted tea, so I\ncame in to serve him. In her heart, she\nwas a little wary. Surely my attempt to\nsteal the antidote won't be exposed,\nright? Damn it. I turned the whole room\nupside down and couldn't find anything.\nFor some reason, all four people in the\nroom shivered, feeling an intense cold.\nSib even let out a loud, confused\nsneeze. Why did the room suddenly get so\ncold? Rule turned her head and noticed\nsomething radiating an icy aura in the\ncorner of the room. It's the cold air\ncoming from that. The four of them\ngathered in front of the bed to look at\nthe object. Looking at it, he remembered\nI almost forgot about it. Looking at the\nthing made him a bit curious. This cold\nair is coming from the egg. Could it be\nan ice element magical beast? Rui's hand\ntouched the surface of the egg as she\nexclaimed, \"It's so big. So big.\" Her\nexpression made him give her a\ndisdainful look. Why are you blushing?\nSuddenly, her face turned bright red as\nshe replied, \"It's not me. It's that the\narea around this egg has become very\nhot.\" It was strange that the egg could\nradiate cold and heat at the same time.\nThe scene made his face darken. What is\nthis? A dual heaven of ice and fire. He\nheld the egg in his arms, his face still\nfull of bewilderment. Can two completely\ncontradictory elemental forces really\ncoexist peacefully inside a single\ncreature's body? Shouldn't it explode?\nThe system panel appeared with a\ndescription. This egg has no name. Its\nidentity is an egg. Its strength is\nlevel 20. Its skills include jumping,\nspinning, and colliding, effective\ncooling, effective heating, and its\nequipment is an eggshell. Its reputation\nis with Eagle Crest, a bride to be\nraised from an egg. The information\nsurprised him. a bride. Seeing the\neggshell turn red made him start acting\nfoolishly as well. Huh? What's it doing?\nDid it get embarrassed from being\ntouched? The world is truly vast and\nfull of wonders. Even an egg can get\nshy. He reached out, pointed at the egg,\nand asked system, \"How do I make this\negg hatch?\" As soon as Sibon asked, the\nsystem answered, \"The mysterious egg\nlikes ice and fire attribute magic\ncores. It also likes to be bathed and\nhave it shell rub. If the host can\nsatisfy these three conditions, then its\nhatching speed will be greatly\nincreased. Lorie suddenly stepped up\nfrom behind, leaned against him, and\nasked, \"Master, whose egg is this?\" As\nhe turned his head, his face was\nsmothered by her chest, leaving him\nfrozen. Ru was about to step forward to\nstop her. Lorie, you again, but she\nignored her and interrogated him. It's\nnot your love child with someone, is it?\nHow could you suddenly produce such a\nbig egg? Hearing that, the egg trembled\nwith anger. He had to start to explain\nthis is a summoned helper like Sarakin\nand the others. Ah. The egg angrily\nblasted a wave of hot air towards the\nthree of them. So hot. Meanwhile, Celia\nwas the complete opposite as her entire\nbody was now being frozen. So cold.\nDespite the egg's tantrum, he still\nwrapped himself around it using a sweet\nvoice to soothe it. Why such a big\nreaction all of a sudden? Don't you like\nbeing bathed and having your shell\nrubbed? What about that maid from\nbefore? So hot. You don't want the beast\ngirl made to do it? Suddenly, he\nproposed, \"How about we assign this task\nto the otherworlders?\" The first thing\nto do every morning is to have the\nplayers come and rub the eggshell. After\nrubbing, they hand over magic cores and\nthen take the egg for a bath. The egg\ncontinued to complain so cold. The egg's\nattitude started to make him agitated.\nIs the information wrong? You don't want\nyour shell rubbed. You don't want magic\ncores. and you don't want me bathed. The\ntwo girls stood silently behind him,\nlistening to him talk to the egg. Is it\nthat you don't want the maid and you\ndon't want the other worlders to rub\nyour shell and take you for a bath?\nYou're only willing to let me rub your\nshell and only willing to bathe with me.\nAh, it's warm now. Was I right? Ru's\nface showed a hint of jealousy as she\nclimbed onto the bed. No way. We want to\ngo, too. Lorie also came forward to\nsuggest rubbing the shell and helping it\nbathe can be left to master. But\nmaster's bath must be left to us. The\ntwo of them kept making a fuss,\nfrightening him. Wait, you two were\nsuddenly causing a scene. It's Sibbon\nraised his hand to stop them. All right,\nwe'll talk about the bathing later.\nLet's name it first. Then he said\nexcitedly since it's still an egg right\nnow. How about we call it Dan Dan? The\nmoment he finished speaking, the egg\nangrily froze him, which the two girls\nfound amusing. Looks like it doesn't\nlike it. Rui smiled and offered a\nsuggestion. How about we call it Kong\nNai? What do you think? In the demihuman\nlanguage, Kong Nai means strong and\nnoble. I hope that in the future, Kong\nNai can become a strong and noble\nmagical beast. When she finished\nspeaking, a gust of air emanated from\nthe egg, delighting her, while a warm\nbreeze as if spring had arrived. He also\ncomfortably enjoyed the breeze. It seems\nto like this name a lot. Then we'll call\nit Kong Nye for now on. The naming issue\nis settled. Siban opened the system and\nperformed a few operations. Now all\nthat's left is to solve the food and\ndrink problem. All right, system. I want\nto issue a quest to the players. The\nsystem opened. Please describe the quest\ncontent. Host. He began to speak. Clear\nout the magical beasts around Lamb Dong\nCity. Anyone who collects 30 level one\nice or fire attribute magic cores can\nexchange them for one fine-grade piece\nof equipment. For other level one magic\ncores, 40 are needed. If there are level\ntwo magic cores, 10 are enough. any\nhigher and the players won't be able to\ndefeat them. The system recorded\neverything he said. New quest. Clear out\nmagical beasts. Ding. The quest has been\npublished. Outside. Everyone who was\nchopping wood and building houses saw\nthe notification and paid close\nattention. What's this? There's a new\nquest. Clear out the magical beasts\naround Lamb Dong City. Anyone who\ncollects 30 level one ice or fire\nattribute magicores can exchange them\nfor a fine grade piece of equipment. A\nyoung man excitedly stood up with a\nsword and said to another boy wearing\nglasses, \"Oh my god, this is a grand\ngesture from the Eagle Crest Lord. We're\nonly level 10 and we can already get\nfine grade equipment as a reward.\" Hey,\nI'm telling you, brother, stop doing\nthis grunt work. Let's go do the quest.\nThe reward is a finera piece of\nequipment. But he refused and continued\nwith his work. No, you guys go ahead. I\nstill want to slowly build and level up.\nAll that fighting and killing is too\nbloody. That calm reaction left the\nyoung man speechless. Listen to you. Are\nyou really treating this as a business\nsimulation game? The content of the\nrecruitment notice board was very\nappealing. Comparing the experience\nbetween construction quests and the new\nbeast hunting quests, a hot topic\ndiscussing which profession is more\nworth choosing. Working with the\ndemihumans in Lambdong City. One\nperson's hands trembled in disbelief.\nWhat? Joining Eagle Crest territory\nmeans you can have five professions and\neven fine grade equipment. They were all\nin a state of confusion. Some crying\ntheir eyes out, others tearing their\nhair out in chaos filled with envy. Why\ndoes Eagler Crest Territo's faction only\nhave 500 slots? Can't you add me? Plus\none. I don't want to stay in this main\ncharacter's camp anymore. An angry\nperson clenched his fist and slammed it\non the table. Even the demihumans are\ngone. What's the point of staying here?\nYow was so furious he felt like he was\nabout to explode. That detestable eagle\ncrest lord. How dare he steal my godhead\nfragment. It cost me a group of heroic\nspirits. And moreover, all those\ndemihumans seem to have been taken to\nLambdong City. It'll be very difficult\nto find a second group of demihumans.\nHis face darkened, his eyes bloodshot,\nlooking utterly distressed. What to do?\nWhat should I do now? Suddenly, someone\ncalled his name, making him startle, and\nhis eyes widen. Yo, a mysterious figure\nin a black cloak appeared. I already\nknow about the godhood matter. This is\nthe counterattack of the will of K. The\nperson wore a mask, so their features\nwere unclear, but there were two long\nblood red lines by their eyes. A sphere\nresembling the earth floated in their\nhand as they continued. However, it's\nnot like I haven't gained anything. I\nhave finished analyzing the relic of\nthat beast tribe. I can now grant your\npeople the beastman profession. The\ncurrent problem isn't something that can\nbe solved just by opening up a beastman\nprofession. However, Yiha grew even\nangrier. The players anti-war sentiment\ntowards Eagle Crest territory was\nalready very clear. They even secretly\nformed an alliance with the first prince\nof the Coen Empire. But what about me?\nI'm just a clown. Do you know what those\nplayers are saying about me on the\nforums? They call me the third wheel,\nthe wrong party, a piece of trash.\nDespite his outburst, the figure replied\ncalmly. The first prince of the Coen\nEmpire in order to gain power has turned\ninto a vampire. I can help you expose\nthis secret of his to the people.\nFurthermore, your choice to deal with\nthe abyss is irreversible. Go cooperate\nwith the back to theocracy. Get\ndemihumans from the back to theocracy.\nHis eyes widened as he received the plan\nfrom the figure. In a subsequent battle,\nyou can also lead my people in a\ncounterattack. Attack the first prince\nand the eagle crest lord and be the\nfisherman who reaps the benefits. As the\nfigure held out a hand, surging waves\nappeared from within it. The slumbering\ndeity of K has begun to awaken.\nCurrently, the Eagle Crest Lord has four\nvessels of divinity. I snatched one from\nthe endless sea, which can help the\ndeity who holds the power of the seas\nwrath to awaken. A golden scepter flew\ninto Yeha's hand, surprising him. If you\ncan help the deity awaken, then before\nthe deity returns to the divine kingdom,\nthey can also lend you a hand. His eyes\nshowed a serious look as he frowned and\nasked, \"Then what should I do?\" The\nfigure's voice deepened as they replied,\n\"Take this. Find the demihuman named Tin\nHigh and use this to stab her in the\nheart.\" He wondered himself, \"I've never\nheard this name before. Isn't she a\ndemihuman from Divine Light Town?\" He\nlooked at the thing before him and\nwondered, \"What is that nauseating black\nthing?\" The room was filled with\nswirling black smoke. The figure's\nanswer made him fearful. Don't touch it.\nThat is the filth of an old god. Once\nyou touch it, you will fall into endless\nravings, eventually degenerating into a\nslave of the old god beyond saving.\nSuddenly, the system panel slowly\nappeared. Temporary epic level war quest\nroyal capital melee quest description.\nAllies of the first prince. You are\npreparing to attack the royal capital\ntogether to prevent the pope from\nusering the throne, but you are unaware.\nThe first prince has been transformed by\nthe undead into a special vampire\nprince. He wants to use the meat grinder\nbattlefield of the royal capital as a\nritual formation to summon the\nterrifying undead scourge using the\ncolon empire as the center to spread\neverywhere until the entire central\ncontinent of canis turned into a sea of\nundead. After reading, everyone was\nstunned. What is this? Although the\neagle crest lord side had a large-scale\nupdate, it's reasonable for the main\ncharacter's side to get an update, too.\nThe quest board continued to display\ninformation. Yeihow, as the son of\nheaven's mandate, has long seen through\nthe first prince's conspiracy, he has\ndecided to beat him at his own game. At\nthe critical moment, deal a fatal blow\nto the first prince, and prevent the\nundead scourge from occurring. Quest\nlimit, none. Quest reward one. Equipment\nof Grandmaster Grade or lower. Rare\ngriffin mount, rare wolf mount, a large\namount of experience points,\nqualification to change to the beastman\nprofession. Equipment enhancement\nticket. Quest reward two. Players who\naccept the quest can immediately receive\na set of common grade equipment and\nthree free skill enhancement scrolls.\nEach scroll can replace one skill point.\nA young man walked up and asked,\n\"Brother X, could it be that the\noperators are unhappy with us abandoning\nthe main character to ally with the\nfirst prince?\" Brother X stared at the\nnotice board and replied, \"That might be\nthe case. They gathered in a group to\ndiscuss. I felt this first prince was\nstrange from the beginning. The way he\nlooked at me was so evil, as if he was\nthinking about where to start eating. It\ncould also be a coincidence. He's a\nstory NPC after all. So, Brother Frog,\nare we taking this quest? He answered\nimmediately. Take it. Why not? We work\nfor whichever side gives us more\nbenefits. That's all there is to it.\nBrother Frog smiled. Besides, the quest\ndescription also makes it very clear\nthat this Baylor Frank guy is no good\neither. This kind of setup clearly\nimplies he sees us as food on his plate.\nThe operators don't want us to join him.\nThe sky turned to dusk. Inside the room,\nSibbon was extremely flustered. With the\nplayer's help, the arrangements for the\ndemihumans are more or less done. The\nthree ampier viscounts of the Andor\nEmpire are gathering their forces. The\nenemy either wants to take this\nopportunity to attack the royal capital\nor they want to attack Eagle Crest\nterritory. We must be on guard. A knock\non the door startled him. Who is it?\nKumain. Roy entered after being\npermitted. My lord, I am Roy. She was\nwearing a maidstyle dress, but it was\nextremely revealing. I wanted to come\ntalk about the demihumans. The sight of\nher made his nose bleed. Dressed like\nthis to talk. His infatuated eyes were\nglued to her like a fools. I came to\nthank you. The demihumans have been\nliving very well here these past few\ndays. Also, about what I agreed to\nbefore, becoming your maid. He spoke up.\nSo that's why you're dressed like this.\nAre you preparing to seduce me? She\nblushed all over and gave him a charming\nlook. Of course not. These are Lorie's\nold clothes. Some parts were too small,\nso I altered them a bit to make them\nless uncomfortably tight. His nose bleed\ngushed like a fountain. Lor's old\nclothes. What's this about being too\ntight? Is she hinting for me to rip it\noff quickly? Seeing the beautiful girl\nin front of him pressing close. Sib's\nmind went blank, unable to think of\nanything. As expected, no matter what,\nshe is a fox tribe sus. When it comes to\nseducing others, other tribes can't\ncompare. In the dark of night, somewhere\na fire blazed, sending up thick smoke.\nEveryone, let's go block the other side.\nA group of people was trying their best\nto kill a demonic beast. Killing this\nblazing firebore will be enough to\ncollect 30 fire element magic cores. We\ncould go find the lord to exchange for\nfine grade equipment. The black-haired\nyoung man swung his sword down. Got it.\nA red spirit stone suddenly appeared.\nThe young man held it in his hand,\nextremely excited. That's enough. Let's\nhurry. The sun is about to set. Let's go\nexchange for the equipment quickly.\nBrother Yin Sue, you're really getting\nmore and more skilled. Suddenly, a shout\nmade the young man turn his head to\nlook. Careful ahead, a spider-shaped\ndemonic beast crawled over. Fortunately,\nhis movements were agile, so he jumped\nhigh to dodge it, but it was enough to\ngive him a good scare. Oh my god, what\nis this? It's a level 9 jungle wolf\nspider. Fear riot threat level hard.\nSeeing this, the people on the side also\npanicked. Oh crap, a spider of a level\nnine spider. It's huge. I hate spiders.\nNobody likes these things. He stabbed\nhis sword into the ground to reassure\nthem. Everyone don't panic. With a few\nof us, we can still kill it. When they\nsaw the thing, everyone was terrified,\ntheir jaws dropping. Oh my god. Someone\nwarned him. Brother Yin, ahead in front\nof you. He looked ahead and saw\ncountless red eyes staring at him,\nmaking his hair stand on end. Oh\nheavens, why are there so many spiders?\nThe wolf spiders looked at them with\ngreat craving, looking extremely\nterrifying. Their average level is nine.\nWe definitely can't win against this. He\nwas startled as he realized something.\n\"Oh, wait. Something's not right.\" The\nyoung man behind him shouted, \"Brother\nYin Sue, don't confront them head-on.\nCome over here first.\" They hid behind a\nlarge rock to avoid the spiders outside\nin disgust. Did you guys notice\nanything? Next to the spider's health\nbars, there are two very strange buffs,\nfear and riot. So, is a demonic beast\nride going to happen? The red-haired\ngirl asked curiously, \"But what would\ncause the demonic beasts to riot? Could\nit be that something is chasing them\naway?\" But he replied, \"Whatever the\nreason, this isn't a normal situation.\nTherefore, this is very likely a hidden\nquest.\" His answer caused a stir among\nthem. Aidenquist, \"Brother Yin Su, are\nyou sure? I've never triggered a hidden\nquest before.\" He smiled confidently.\n\"Of course, how could I not be sure?\"\nThe sword he had stuck in the ground\nbegan to glow. Look, this sword itself\nwas from Hidden Quest. You all have to\ntrust me. My nose for these things is\nextremely accurate. The brown-haired\nyoung man asked worriedly. So, what do\nwe do now? How do we do this quest? He\nturned and asked the young man in\nreturn. When you encounter a hidden\nquest, you naturally have to find the\nkey NPC. Who do you think the key NPC\naround us is? Griemont. He's definitely\nat the training grounds. We can't go\nover there without a certain rank. The\nmaid Lori and the saintest Roy are\nmostly by the eagle crest lord's side,\nright? After hearing that, the\nred-haired girl replied, \"Um, well then\nthat's a goodbye.\" Her answer satisfied\nhim. That's right. We just need to tell\nhim about this demonic beast, riot. Then\nwe'll know if it's a hidden quest or\nnot. Right away over here, goodbye's\nface was full of vigilance. Who is it? A\nsneak attack in the middle of the night.\nYan Suurly spoke up. Don't be hasty.\nIt's us. Seeing them surprised him.\nPlayers, it's so late. What's the\nmatter? He recounted everything. When we\nwere on a mission in the sunset forest,\nwe discovered that the jungle wolf\nspiders were rioting. Their numbers are\nhuge. There must be hundreds of them\nright now. They are heading this way.\nHearing this made him panic, but he was\nstill suspicious. What are you sure?\nThis is extremely important. You can't\njust say things recklessly. The spiders\noutside are slowly crawling towards the\ncity. We're sure they really are\nrioting. Moreover, they'll be here soon.\nIf that's the case, then stop killing\ndemonic beasts. Go back and wait for me\nto report to the Lord end. We'll figure\nit out from there. Goodbye's footsteps\nwere hurried as he ran like the wind.\nThis is an emergency. This is an\nemergency. There can be no delay.\nHowever, just thinking of the scene of\nSibbon with two beauties in his arms\nmade him so jealous he could cry a\nriver. However, our master is a\nwonderful man at night. As soon as he\nreached the door, he heard strange\nsounds coming from inside the room. Ah,\nLord Heavy, don't stop. It made him\nbreak out in a cold sweat, not knowing\nwhat to do. I don't want to be punished\nby having to wash underpants again. The\nsound continued, \"So comfortable.\" His\nhand on the door trembled as he started\nto cry. As expected, the Lord is busy.\n\"If I burst in now, I'm afraid I'll have\nto wash underpants and socks for a year.\nBut what if I don't go in?\" Inside the\nroom, Sibbon was kneeling on the bed,\nplacing his hand on Royy's back. See\nthat? This strength, this technique, a\nmassage has to be like this. If you want\nto serve me, you still have a lot to\nlearn in the future. Lying prone on the\nbed, she replied softly. Um, I will\npractice diligently. His face flushed as\nhe watched her wrap her arms around his\nneck. Then her whole body wrapped around\nhim seductively as she said, \"Why don't\nwe try it right now?\" His face full of\nsatisfaction. He was pushed onto his\nback on the bed by her. This time, I\nwill definitely master the strength. He\nclosed his eyes in enjoyment and said,\n\"I have a feeling that mastering all\nkinds of strength on my spot isn't\neasy.\" Her two hands rested on his\nabdomen. However, before she could do\nanything, he arched his body, making her\ntremble. My lord, my lord, don't move\naround. However, he quickly sat bolt\nupright, grabbing her an alarm. That's\nnot right. It's not me. The ground is\nshaking. A sharp clawed foot stomped\nheavily on the ground. A dragon-like\ndemonic beast appeared with a ferocious\nlook. Around it were spiders. Wolf\nspiders with it. A knight on the wall\nsaw it and announced in panic. Demonic\nbeasts are attacking the city. Demonic\nbeasts are attacking the city. With no\nother choice, goodbye could only burst\nin crying. Report. Reporting to the\nlord. Players have discovered a demonic\nbeast riot in the forest. Hearing that,\nhe was surprised. Then why didn't you\nreport to me sooner? This angered him\nand he reprimanded him as he walked. For\nyour poor performance, you will wash the\nentire army's socks for a year. He had\nalready expected this outcome, so he\ncould only accept his fate. Yes. Next,\nhe turned to give orders. Roy, I'm going\nto the city wall to check the situation.\nPlease go and calm the demihumans. She\ndidn't hesitate to stand up. I\nunderstand. Please be careful, my lord.\nThe quest panel appeared. Ding. The\ndaily villain quest has been refreshed.\nVillain quest one. Eliminate the\ncourting dragon beast chasm. Villain\nquest two. Eliminate all the pitiful\ndemonic beasts that were chased here to\nattack the city. Villain quest three.\nSteal the treasure of the courting\ndragon beast chasm. He hurly ran down\nthe stairs in surprise. An idea suddenly\nflashed in his mind. What the hell is a\ncording dragon beast chasm? Courting\nwho? Pursuing who? Griemont city has no\ndragons. H. Suddenly, Sibbon remembered\nthe presence of the egg. That's not\nright. Although they say Greenmont City\nhas no dragons, there is a suspicious\negg. Could it be that there's a dragon\ninside? His face lit up as he imagined a\ncute dragon girl. The system is giving\nme a dragon girl. So exciting. Is it\nreally possible? He rushed outside with\nhis sword and ordered, \"Attention\neveryone. All personnel to the city\nwalls to defend the city listened to the\ncommand of Clement and Ben. They were\nsurprised to see him. my lord. He stood\non a high platform and ordered them, all\nplayers and crusaders, follow me out of\nthe city to meet the enemy. Defend\nGriemont City, Blood Hoof Clan, protect\nthe priest legion. Follow me closely.\nOpen the city gates. The system began to\nannounce. Ding. A hidden quest has been\nactivated. Follow the Eagle Crest Lord\nout of the city to fight the beast tide.\nProtect Greenmont City. Quest. The\nnumber of monsters is very large. Follow\nthe Eagle Crest Lord's footsteps\nclosely. Perhaps you will live longer.\nThe Priest Legion has healing abilities.\nIf you're caught by a monster, you can\nask a priest for help. Quest reward one.\nA large amount of experience points.\nFind great equipment exchangeable with\ndemonic cores. Quest reward two. The top\nfive players who kill the most monsters\nwill have a chance to be taught skills\nby the Eagle Crest Lord. Eagle Crest\nLord's favorability with you plus 10,\nreaching normal. Current favorability is\nzero. After reading it, the players were\nexcited. Oh my god, a hidden quest\nreally was activated. Brother Yin, we\nbrothers will follow you this time. If\nfavorability reaches 100, can we romance\nthe eagle crest lord? Brother, what's\nyour sexual orientation? Suddenly, a\nloud noise rang out, startling them.\nQuick, quick, look over there. What kind\nof monster is that? It's so huge. The\ndragon's bloodshot eyes stared at them.\nEven its roar was terrifying. Warning,\nworld boss Cami has been discovered. The\nworld boss raid quest has begun. Quest\nobjective. Under the leadership of the\neagle crest lord. Eliminate the dragon\nbeast cassmi and the beast tide. Quest\nrewards. A huge amount of experience\npoints. A chance for a subdragon blood\nbath. Various rare materials. The title\nof legwashing ambassador. Questa. Follow\nthe eagle crest lord's footsteps. He\nbeheads. Everyone added on. Sibbon's\nglowing figure flew over surprising two\nguys. Oh my god, it's a world boss.\nWell, it looks so big. But the girl next\nto them was confused. What is this\nreminder related to the eagle crest lord\nmean? His whole body emitting a\nbrilliant golden light. He flew towards\nthe dragon beast. I don't care what kind\nof world boss you are. You can't steal\nmy little dragon. The beast is currently\nat level 52 nightmare. Its health bar\nreached 20,000, making everyone also\nstunned. Holy crap, this health bar. Why\nis it so long? Level 52 nightmare level\nthreat. Is that all? I thought it would\nbe much stronger. Hey everyone, its\nwings are so small. Could have been born\nprematurely. Suddenly, it opened its\nhuge mouth and fire rushed out, wanting\nto burn everyone. Damn it. Why does this\nflame effect look so real? Then it\nraised its giant hand, making them run\naway in fear. Get out of the way. It's\ngoing to stomp on us. Just as that hand\nwas about to grab a young man, for some\nreason, it stopped. It turned out that\nSibbon had arrived in time and was\nholding its tail. The dragon beast\nroared angrily with a meaning\ndetestable. How dare you grab the tail\nof the great terrifying and evil dragon\nchasm. You insect will pay the price for\nyour ignorant actions. It was so angry\nthat a fiercely glowing fireball\nappeared inside its mouth. But he was\nnot afraid and held its tail tightly\nsince he liked to talk so big. Have a\ntaste of yourself. Saying that, he\nbrutally and unexpectedly shoved its\ntail into its mouth, making it drool\neverywhere and whimper pitifully. Next,\nhe stood on its head, raising his\nglowing sword. The game is over. Go die.\nHis hand came down, slashing its horn,\nreducing its health by 58.88, leaving\nonly 14112. It was terrified. Luckily, I\ndodged quickly. This insect cannot be\nunderestimated. Run away. No sooner said\nthan done, it immediately turned and\nfled cowardly, making everyone hurriedly\nthrow their weapons at it. Don't let the\nboss get away. The Eagle Crest Lord is\nso scary. He took out one quarter of its\nhealth in just two hits. Use chain\nhooks. Use the chain hooks. Listen to my\ncommand. Aim carefully and throw the\nchains together. Then find a place to\nhook on and pull tight. One, two, throw.\nAs soon as the words were out, a series\nof chain hooks were continuously\nlaunched. In the end, it couldn't avoid\nbeing tied up. They held the chains\ntightly together to prevent its escape\nand shouted, \"My lord, finish it. We'll\nhelp you hold it down. Use your\nultimate. Use your ultimate.\" Sib began\nto use his converging sword cheese\nskill, his whole body surging with\npower. Behind him, a giant golden lion\nappeared, opening its mouth wide, full\nof sharp teeth, looking very\nfrightening. Then that stream of power\nshot like the wind towards chasm. The\npower wrapped around its whole body like\na rope, making it scream. The scene made\nthem gasp in shock. We won. So cool.\nSuch a big and long sword chi. Besides,\nthey were rejoicing as victory drew\nnearer. It still had three quarters of\nits health. And he killed it with just\none sword strike. Is this the damage of\na berserker? From this day on, I am the\nEagle Crest Lord's puppy. Don't you all\nfight me for the position of his number\none puppy? Watching the falling specks\nof light, he frowned and thought. That\nultimate skill just now was not only\nmagnificent, but also extremely\npowerful. But the charging time is too\nlong. I don't usually use it. So this\ntime the player's coordinated operation\nwas not bad. They controlled the dragon\nbeast, bought time, and achieved the\nrequired support effect. Then he ordered\nsystem distribute the rewards now.\nImmediately, a golden circle descended.\nEveryone looked at it in surprise. It's\nreal. This is the subdragon blood. But\nmy level is increasing. I've obtained\nprimary giant strength. Woof woof. Thank\nyou, my lord. The system issued an\nannouncement to everyone. World boss\nChasm has been killed. The defeater is\nthe Eagle Crest Lord. All participating\nplayers will receive rewards based on\ntheir contribution level. In this\nbattle, you restricted Chasm's movement,\ncreating an opportunity for the Eagle\nCrest Lord. You have gained 15,000\nexperience points. Congratulations on\nobtaining the title leg washing\nambassador. Congratulations on receiving\na Subdragon blood bath. After the\nSubdragon blood bath, your skills and\nlevel have been significantly increased.\nChasm's dismembered parts lay on the\nground, making everyone gather around\nexcitedly to touch and see. Is this the\nworld boss's claw? Take a picture. Post\non the forums. Look at the quality of\nthis material. Half of the materials\nreally belong to us. The Eagler Crest\nLord is so generous. Sibbon stood with\nhis arms crossed, observing the\nsituation from the side. It's good that\nthey're voluntarily cleaning up the\nbattlefield, but letting the players\ntake such high-grade materials is a\nwaste. System: If players provide the\nmaterials, can you craft equipment for\nthem? The system appeared to answer his\nquery. Ding. After obtaining the\nmysterious crystal shard, through a\nseries of analyses and refinements of\nthe crystal shard, a large number of\nplayer related features have now been\nunlocked. Materials obtained by players\ncan be converted into villain points.\nPlayers can use materials to craft\nequipment, but it will consume the\nhost's villain points. The answer made\nhim a bit curious. Materials can be\nconverted into villain points. Then, can\nthe materials I obtain be converted into\nvillain points? But the system replied\nthat it was not possible. Seeing this,\nhe asked again, \"What if I give the\nmaterials to the players and then the\nplayers submit them?\" The system\nanalyzed for a moment before replying.\nhost. Please do not look for loopholes\nin the system to bend the rules.\nConverting materials into villain points\nwill be based on the actual value of the\nmaterials themselves. The higher the\ngrade of the material, the greater the\nloss. 100 g of bore teeth will convert\nto 10 points, while 10,000 g of dragon\nclaws will get you 100 points. After\nreading, he rubbed his chin\nthoughtfully. So, that's how it is.\nThen, forget it. System set up a feature\nfor me where consuming materials can\nenhance equipment. And let's set the\nsuccess rate to 20 for now. The system\nreceived the command and presented a\npanel. The enhancement feature template\nhas been uploaded. Enhancing equipment\nrequires four materials. S or no. But he\nwasn't a fool who could be tricked. You\nwant to spend my villain points? No way.\nCrafting equipment. Failing once or\ntwice is reasonable, right? Thinking of\nthis, his expression brightened. By\nthen, players will spend five portions\nof materials to succeed once. I'll take\nthe other four portions, convert them\ninto villain points, and I won't be a\nloss anymore. So much money to be made.\nThe news of Chasm's defeat was also\nannounced. Breaking news. Greenmont\nCity, a world boss has appeared after\nbathing in Subdragon blood. My stats.\nAfter bathing in Subdragon blood, my\nstats. From now on, I'm a number one dog\nof the Eagle Crest Lord. A person in a\nblack cloak and a few eggs on the ground\nwere surrounded by a group of people.\nThese Greenmont City players are getting\nmore and more outrageous. I can't\nbelieve they even got a hidden world\nboss quest in comparison. Look, what's\nour hidden quest? It's up to fate.\nEverything is up to fate. The person in\nthe cloak said to them, \"How about it?\nAs long as you all complete the mission,\neach of you will get a carnivorous bird\negg. They're not only excellent combat\ncompanions, but also very advantageous\nmouths. A sudden announcement was made.\nA hidden quest has been activated. Quest\nobjective. Escort the demihumans to the\ntarget location. Quest description. The\nmysterious person agreed to escort these\ndemihumans deep into the forest near\nDivine Light Town. However, this\nmysterious person seems to have urgent\nmatters to attend to and cannot complete\nthis mission. He hopes to use the\ncarnivorous bird eggs to hire you.\nMission limit 10 people. Mission reward\n10,000 experience points. Carnivorous\nbird egg. Note, this is a unique quest.\nPlease do not share it with others or\nthe mission reward will disappear. All\nright, stop complaining. After all, the\nreward is a rare mount, although it's\nvery rare. Does anyone want to ride a\ncarnivorous bird? A man with sturdy\nmuscles said loudly, \"No matter what,\nit's just an escort mission. It probably\nwon't be too difficult. We'll take this\nmission.\" After saying that, he looked\nover at a group of people standing there\nsmiling at him. But I have a question.\nWhat are you demihumans doing running to\nsuch a gloomy forest? The slightly naive\nlooking young man replied, \"Respected\nadventurer, we are demihumans from the\nroyal capital. We came here to search\nfor the demihumans sacred relic. This is\nextremely important to us. I hope you\ncan help us.\" Hearing this, he laughed,\ngave a thumbs up, and readily agreed.\nAll right. All right. We will protect\nyou all and escort you to a safe place.\nBut he didn't notice that far in the\ndistance behind a tree a figure was\nwatching them. That person was Yeihow,\nholding a sword with a fierce\nexpression, thinking to himself, \"I'm\nsorry, players. This is the only way I\ncan reduce the chance of being exposed\nto a minimum.\" Unexpectedly, the sword\nin his hand trembled and spoke, \"Hungry!\nHungry! Eat, eat everything, souls.\" It\nmade him break out in a cold sweat.\nHungry again. A while later, after he\nhad returned to his room, he sighed to\nhimself, \"Really, where am I supposed to\nfind so many souls?\" He walked over and\nopened a cabinet. Inside, two girls were\ntied up, trembling with fear. And it\nonly eats the souls of infants and young\ndemihuman girls. If this sword wasn't so\npowerful, I would have thrown away long\nago. Despite them trembling in fear, he\nshowed not a shred of pity. Don't blame\nme. Being weak is a sin, just like my\ncurrent self. The sword continuously\nemitted sounds. Want, want to eat. Deep\nin the two girls' eyes, one could see\nthat despair had completely taken over.\nHis voice was soft, yet incredibly\nterrifying, by any means necessary. I\nmust become stronger. After he spoke,\nthe scene turned completely red with\nblood. It was understood that the two\nunfortunate girls had lost their lives\nat the hands of Yeihow. Inside the\nforest, a group of people had gathered\nto start the mission. Brothers, why is\nthis forest so gloomy? It was normal\nbefore. I don't know what happened. Even\nthe trees are all tilted and crooked.\nOne person among them looked at them a\nlittle scared. Demihuman Brothers, you\nall are really calm. Aren't you scared?\nThe muscular guy looked at the system\nnotification panel. We've arrived at the\nlocation marked on the map. In front of\nthem was a strange circle and in the\nmiddle of the circle was the shape of a\nred eye. We finally arrived. Why is the\npattern on the ground so strange? The\nyoung demihuman man and the other\ndemihumans suddenly broke into a bizarre\nsmile. Thank you very much for your\nhelp, brave adventurers. This is the\nlocation where the sacred relic once\nappeared. We will search around here.\nYou may all leave now. However, he\ndidn't sense anything strange in that\nsmile and started to leave. That's\nright. It's not convenient for outsiders\nto see the demihumans's sacred relic. If\nyou need any help in the future, you can\nfind us again. Suddenly, the young\ndemihuman man grabbed a girl's hand and\nsaid, \"Well, then let's begin.\" However,\nthat was just a pretense. In reality,\nthey were hiding behind a bush to\nobserve the group of demihumans gathered\naround the circle performing some kind\nof ritual. Everyone feels it strange,\ntoo, right? Their smiles are so fake.\nPlus, every single one of them is\nsmiling. I don't know what's so funny.\nIt's true. Seeing them smile gives me\ngoosebumps down my back. There's\nmovement looked quickly. From within the\ncircle, a head that looked like a\ndragon's with blood red demonic eyes\nappeared, but they didn't stop and\ncontinued to chant something. Great\nAbyss General Finnen, your loyal\nservant, Shana, is here to offer a\nsacrifice to you. Please open the gate\nto the abyss. The monster's hideous\nappearance became clearer and clearer,\nfrightening anyone who looked at it.\nThat monster turned out to be a gate.\nIt's called the abyss teleportation\ngate, but the inside was pitch black, so\nthere was no telling where it led. After\nwitnessing that scene, he urgently said\nto everyone, \"Brothers, quickly stop\nthese demihumans. Don't let them enter\nthat gate. It's highly likely they've\nbeen brainwashed. The demihuman young\nman who was smiling amicably earlier\ndiscovered them behind him. Adventurers,\nwhat do you think you're doing? His face\ntensed as he retorted, \"What are we\ndoing? Do you know what you're doing?\nThis is the abyss teleportation gate. Do\nyou want to go in there and become food\nfor demons?\" The demihuman girl with a\nbewildered face wanted to walk towards\nthe gate, but her hand was grabbed by\nhim. I don't understand what you're\nsaying. We're just on our way home.\nReturning to the nation of the great\ngeneral Fain. He tried to make them\nunderstand. Doing this, you're walking\nright into the belly of a demon.\nSuddenly, a giant crimson arm emerged\nfrom the gate and sent him flying with a\nsingle punch. The owner of the arm\nstepped out. It was a level 40 demon\ngeneral in the form of a large white\nskeleton. Upon seeing it, they broke out\nin a terrified sweat. A level 40 demon\ngeneral. Because he was punched, they\nworriedly turned to look at him. brother\nnot shooting Kuang Ban. Are you okay? It\nseemed the blow didn't affect him much\nas he was able to stand up strongly and\nreply, \"I'm fine.\" One person knock out\nthose demihumans and save them, then\nfind a chance to slip away and informed\nBrother Frog. He turned to look at it\nand shouted, \"Chop its legs. Chop its\nlegs.\" The young man immediately\ncomplied, and one slash deducted 375\nfrom its health. Next, another person\nused a sword to slash at its underside,\ndeducting up to 769 from its health.\nNice. Take a thousand years of death\nfrom me. Surrounded by them, it grew\nangrier. Oh my god, brothers. It's a\ncritical hit. This spot is a weak point.\nCome and stab it. Being stabbed in the\nback by multiple swords at once made it\ncry out in pain. Finally, unable to bear\nit any longer. It fell to the ground\namidst his mockery. Is that all you've\ngot? It seems the strength of demons\nisn't all that great. Brothers, let's\nhurry and get these demihumans out of\nhere. Suddenly, a shadow appeared in\ncursed, useless trash. They still didn't\nunderstand what was happening and asked\nin confusion, \"What was that sound?\"\nJust as they weren't paying attention, a\npitch black hand with sharp claws\nreached out. With just a light slam, it\ndeducted 7856\nand 3924 from their health. The young\nman after being hit was still dazed and\ndidn't understand. Brother not shooting\nKuang Ban. What happened? Why is\neverything black? We're dead. His eyes\nwere shut tight in resignation. How\ncould we not be dead? A level 78 demon\ngeneral. It wiped us out with just one\nhand. It seems our rescue attempt this\ntime was a complete failure. A series of\nnotifications appeared. It reached out\nits hand and grabbed a few people. Then\nit slowly pulled them through the gate.\nName: Fenton Kaliso Njieven. Identity\ndemon general strength level 78 abyss\nlord 61 to 80 champion others not yet\navailable on the other side a person was\ncontinuously knocking on the door\ncalling out loudly big brother Yeihow\nare you there yehow looking tired\nscratched his head and came out what's\nthe matter seeing him come out brother\nfrog said so sorry to bother you while\nyou're resting we killed a demon general\nand got three demon crystals we wanted\nto ask you to take a look and see how\nmuch they're worth and if we can\nexchange changed them for some\nequipment. The news shocked him, a demon\ngeneral. So he wondered himself, could\nit be that the players didn't obediently\nescort the demihumans to the abyss\nteleportation gate? Or did they get into\na conflict with the demons in the\nteleportation gate? Seeing his face\ndarken and that he said nothing, he also\nfell silent. A few seconds later, he\nasked with concern, \"Big brother Yeihow,\nwhat's wrong?\" The question startled him\nback to his senses and he forced a\nsmile. No, it's nothing. I'm just happy\nfor everyone. Is that so? You all\nmanaged to work together to kill a\nthree-headed hellhound? That must be at\nleast a mid-rank demon existence, right?\nHe reached out to take the item from\nBrother Frog's hand. Come on, give me\nthe demon crystal. If so, its demon\ncrystal is worth 500 gold coins. One can\nbe exchanged for about five sets of fine\nequipment. If it's a high rank demon,\none demon crystal is worth 1,000 gold\ncoins and can be exchanged for 10 sets\nof fine equipment for me. Before\nleaving, Brother Frog waved and smiled\ngoodbye. Thanks. I'll go discuss it with\nthe other aarent then. If we want to\ntrade, we'll come find you later. He\nalso smiled in reply. Dear best.\nHowever, Brother Frog's face suddenly\nturned serious. Contrary to his bright\nsmile from a moment ago. Not Shu and\nKuang Band saw him return and asked\ncuriously. Oh, you're back. How did it\ngo, Brother Frog? Did you find anything\nout? He replied somewhat dejectedly. I\ncouldn't find anything out. I just have\na suspicion. Brother Frog told everyone.\nI suspect. How is the man in black you\nall were talking about? The news\nsurprised everyone. He widened his eyes\nin disbelief. Are you crazy? How could\nthat be? Isn't he the protagonist?\nBrother Frog seriously told everyone is\nreasoning. Think about it carefully.\nDivine Light Town is just a very small\nplace in Eagle Crest territory. Why\nwould the demons build a separate\nteleportation gate here? If it's for the\ndemihumans of Divine Light Town, that\ndoesn't make much sense because almost\nall the demihumans of Eagle Crest\nterritory are now in Greenmont City.\nPlus, those demihumans came from the\nroyal capital. So, the mysterious person\nwho gave that quest must be an insider\nfrom Divine Light Town and is also\ncolluding with the royal capital. After\nhearing those words, he was also\ncompletely convinced. That makes sense.\nThe girl next to him wondered, \"Then why\ndo you think it's E-How?\" Brother Frog\ndidn't hesitate to explain. After\nplaying the game for so many days,\nhidden quests are activated either by\nplayers thinking they are or they come\nfrom E-How or related to E-How. Of\ncourse, the Griemont Castle side is an\nexception. After hearing this, the group\nbecame dejected and gloomy. The most\nobvious thing is this mysterious person\nunderstands players too well, knew that\nwe had our mount stolen not long ago,\nand knows how to use carnivorous bird\neggs to entice people's hearts. Not\nShuin Kuang Ban finally believed his\nreasoning. So the man in black can only\nbe yehow. Hearing this, the girl sides\nsadly. I can't believe the protagonist\nis the villain. Although there have been\nquite a few games like this recently.\nThe bald guy next to them asked, \"The\nGriemont Castle side is playing a\nbusiness simulation. Are we on this side\nplaying an adventure puzzle?\" But\nBrother Frog quickly instructed them,\n\"This isn't urgent. Call up all the\nremaining people first. We should\nprobably go to the first prince's castle\nto gather.\" Hearing this, they\nimmediately accepted the order. Yes,\nBrother Frog. As he turned to leave, an\ninterested smile appeared on Brother\nFrog's face. A hypocritical protagonist,\na straightforward villain. This game is\ngetting more and more interesting. On\nthis side, a group of people was\nassembling in neat rows. My lord, the\nexpeditionary force has fully assembled.\nPlease give your instructions.\" He\nreplied, \"I know.\" Behind Sibbon was an\nentire army ready to fight alongside\nhim. The entire army will march out.\nWith that, he pointed his sword straight\nto the sky, full of confidence and\ndetermination to win the battle. The\nscene changes to inside a castle where a\nyoung man is holding a girl in his arms\nas a knight approaches to report. Your\nhighness, the lords, they they should be\narriving soon. The young man just\nreplied quietly. I know he was a\nhandsome, fair-skinned, golden-haired\nyoung man. So much so that the girl\ncouldn't help but look at him with an\ninfatuated gaze. Let them come. Let them\nall come. The more the better. The more\nthat come, the more we'll die and the\nsmoother my plan will go. Suddenly, he\nbared his blood red fangs and moved\nclose to the girl's neck. But the girl,\nunaware of what was happening, was still\nsmiling. Father, I never wanted to do\nthis. It was you who forced me. How am I\ninferior to that useless second prince?\nIf it weren't for you, I wouldn't have\nturned into this current form that is\nneither human nor ghost. I clearly\ndedicated everything to this nation.\nbright red blood splattered out. He had\nnow transformed into the appearance of a\nvampire with fresh blood staining his\nmouth. The poor girl thus lost her life\ncompletely in his hands. As expected,\nonly bloodth and the undead are loyal.\nOutside, an army of soldiers, each\nholding a weapon, stood in neat rows. A\nman with a pot belly announced after\nmany days, \"I am very happy to see\neveryone gathered at this fortress\nagain. The first prince will not forget\nthe loyalty of all of you. Inside the\nroom, everyone was gathered and seated\nlistening. Sib cursed inwardly. Loyalty\nin your dreams. But the man continued to\nspeak loudly. Currently, the lords of\nRotor territory, Monty territory, and\nWolf Fong territory have defected to the\nHoly Sea. Their armies are also\nprotecting their respective territories,\nforming the first line of defense\nagainst an attack on the royal capital.\nThe most important thing we need to do\nis to break this defensive line and then\njointly attack the royal capital. The\nmore he spoke, the more unpleasant his\nexpression became. I will now assign the\nattack missions to everyone. Earl Eagle\nCrest Earl Moost, your two armies are\nthe largest. Attack the largest\nterritory. Rotor together. The young man\nsitting next to him maintained a smile\non his face as he listened to the\nassignments. Viscount Fit and Baron one\nof Tulip territory will follow me and\nthe first prince's fortress army to\nattack Monty territory. Finally, Earl\nFrost Wolf and Viscount Fingshine along\nwith the Aberren, you will all attack\nWolf Fong territory together. Hearing\nthis, two men inside whispered to each\nother. Perhaps in the future, everyone\nwill have to go to Earl Eagle Crest to\nearn a living. Yeha is no good, and the\nfirst prince is no better. His voice\ncontinued to ring out. the other minor\nnobles who only have titles but no\nterritory. You just need to lead your\ntroops and follow your respective lords.\nAfter capturing the three territories,\ngather at the designated location. Are\nthere any other questions? Suddenly, the\nblue-haired Earl Mong with a mocking\nexpression stroked his beard and said,\n\"First prince, rest assured, in terms of\nmilitary strength, no one can compare to\nme. I will definitely capture rotor\nterritory quickly.\" Earl Eagle Crest, a\npleasure to cooperate with you. Sibbon\nalso smiled friendly. I also hope that\nyou can remain this happy forever. The\nman held a sparkling blue orb in his\nhand and presented it. The battle\nsituation is urgent. All lords, please\nproceed to your attack positions before\nnoon. I've already drawn the subsequent\nassembly point on a simple map. This is\na communication crystal. After everyone\narrives, just use this to report back to\nme. Earl Mong sitting next to him spoke\nup. Rest assured, I will report to the\nfirst prince in a timely manner. He\nreached out his hand to take the orb,\nbut suddenly it flew into Sibbon's hand.\nThis scene made him so angry his face\nturned red and he gritted his teeth. Why\nwas the communication crystal given to\nEarl Eagle Crest and not me? My soldiers\nare clearly the most numerous. Is Earl\nEagle Crest Kang's father? Outside, the\nsun was glaring. And seeing Sibbon's\nmajestic figure standing with Lori and\nRuer was even more of an eyesore to him.\nThis kind of little brat who has to\nbring maids to a battle. I'm afraid he\nwon't even know how he died. Next, he\nturned his head to look at his own\nsoldiers and smiled smugly. Anyway, my\narmy is large. I just need to force Earl\nEagle Crest a hand over the\ncommunication crystal. Once he sees my\narmy, he won't dare to resist. When it's\ntime to attack the city, I'll let the\narmy of Eagle Crest territory be the\ncannon fodder. He he at that time, not\nonly will his army be mine, but his\nwomen will be mine, too. After\nfinalizing his plan, he took the\ninitiative to walk over and start\nconversation. I say, Earl Eagle. Seeing\nhim talking to him, Sibon also asked,\n\"Oh, Earlmong, is there something you\nneed?\" His face was flushed as he gave a\nperverted smile. You see the troops\nbehind me, don't you? An item like the\ncommunication crystal should be held by\nthe main force. However, Sibbon didn't\ncomply and instead stood there with his\nhands on his hips and burst out\nlaughing. I told you so. Haha. So what\nif I don't? Seeing him refuse so bluntly\nsurprised him. The flag, the golden lion\nbattle flag. Are those all soldiers from\nEagle Crest territory? Didn't you say\nyou only brought a few troops? Seeing\nthis, Sibbon adopted a teasing tone.\nThat's right. It's just a few. Just this\nmany. I don't even know if they can\nwithstand the magic cannons of Roter\nCity. So, Earl Mong, from now on, you'll\nfollow my command, right? Let me use\nyour soldiers as sacrifices. Earl Mong\nacted as if he heard a joke and mocked\nhim. Yes, that's right. Haha, you little\nbrat. You think I would say that? But\nSibbon wasn't angry and just stood there\nlooking at him. Earl Mong was boasting\nabout himself. Who do you think you are?\nI am the great Earl Mong. when suddenly\nhe was pierced by a sharp object,\nsending blood splattering everywhere,\nand he also spat out a mouthful of\nblood. Sib calmly watched as two\nblackclad knights skewered Earl Mong to\ndeath and muttered softly. As expected,\nhe doesn't know his place. However, the\nsoldiers standing below were terrified,\n\"What? What? Earl Eagle Crest, are you\ninsane? How dare you kill the Earl?\nAvenge the Earl?\" The swords in the\nhands of the two blackclad knights were\nenveloped in a terrifying aura of power.\nBut when did those knights appear beside\nhim? He didn't give them a chance to be\nsurprised for long as the two knights\nflew over and unleashed immense power\nlike lightning bolt striking down on\nthem. Ah, next. A knight pointed his\nsword directly at them, sending a chill\nof fear through everyone. How about it?\nThe sight of them being subdued by him\nwas amusing to Sibbon. Surrender or die\ndirectly. Forced to choose, they\nstammered. I with no other choice. They\nhad to choose the option that would save\ntheir lives. We are willing to obey the\norders of Earl Eagle Crest. We will go\nthrough mountains of daggers and seas of\nfire. We will never refuse. The answer\nmade Sibbon smile with satisfaction.\nVery good. Much wiser than your mom was.\nOutside a sturdy fortress wall. Sibbin\nhad moved there on his warhorse. He\nobserved it carefully for a moment, then\nspoke slowly. I have arrived at the\nattack point. But on each wall of rotor\nterritory, there are 10 destruction\nmagic cannons. Their power is extremely\nstrong. Attacking the city will be\nincredibly difficult. All the walls of\nall the core territories of the royal\ncapital are like this. Use the lives of\nsoldiers to besiege it. No matter what\nmethod you use, as long as you can reach\nthe designated assembly point in 3 days,\nit will be fine. Then he thought to\nhimself, then what's the use of you as\nthe operational commander? A low-level\ntactic like trading lives for the\nobjective even requires a special\ncommunication crystal for this. I can't\nunderstand how this pigheaded kong\nbecame a general. Then suddenly Ruer ran\nover and called out, \"My lord, I think I\ncould solve your problem.\" He gently\npinched her cheek, teasing, \"Oh, what\nbrilliant idea does my night of time\nhave?\" Which made her immediately\ncorrect him. Don't joke at times like\nthis. Really? Then she suddenly spoke in\na serious and direct tone. What I want\nto say is if we can get close to the\ncity wall, you can let me use time\nstagnation to reduce the time. This\nrange has a maximum radius of 10 m which\nshould be enough for us to enter rotor\ncity. This made him a bit doubtful and\nhe hurly asked, \"You want to use your\nawakening skill?\" Sibbon was so worried\nthat he hastily jumped off his horse,\ngrabbed her arm tightly and frantically\nasked, \"If you use that your body, you\nreally don't have to force yourself like\nthis. I can definitely think of another\nway. Which made her answer with some\nembarrassment. Um, maybe. Then the young\nlady sighed softly and expressed her\nfeelings. I want to help you. Can I? As\nsoon as she finished speaking, his\ncheeks flushed red as he softly called.\nRoy. His mood brightened up considerably\nas he hugged her tightly and replied\nwith a smile. I understand. In that\ncase, I will now have the Aaron and Mong\nsoldiers launch a frontal assault on the\ncity wall to draw their fire. You\nabsolutely must not force yourself.\nOkay. Seeing him agree, she also beamed\nand said, \"Yes.\" Then the system\nsuddenly announced, \"Ting, attention\nplayers, an epic level war quest has now\nbeen announced. Attack Rotor City. Quest\ndescription: Because Rotor City has\ndestruction level magic cannons. To\ncomplete the decapitation strike plan,\nLord Eagle Crest requires you to lead\nMong's army and attract the enemy's\nattention on the city wall. Be careful\nto avoid the attacks of the magic\ncannons. This quest has an extremely\nhigh risk of death. Quest objective,\nlaunch a fearless all-out assault on the\nmain wall of Rotor City. Quest rewards,\nexperience points, equipment enhancement\nvouchers, equipment lottery vouchers.\nQuest reminder, please be careful to\navoid the attacks of the magic cannons.\nThey will cause you great harm. However,\nthe players whose fighting spirit was\nalready boiling all spoke nonchalantly\nas if they didn't know the meaning of\nfear. What's the risk of death to us? As\nlong as this fine set of gear gets\nenhanced again, lottery vouchers. The\nhearts of us gamblers are burning up.\nDestroy Rotor City. At this moment,\ninside a room, a subordinate\nrespectfully reported, \"My lord, there's\nnew intelligence. Over 10,000 soldiers\nhave appeared outside the city and are\nlaunching an attack on Roter City.\"\nAfter looking at it, not only was he not\nflustered, but he just sighed\ncontemptuously. 10,000. Over 10,000\nsoldiers want to take Rotor City. Is\nthere something wrong with that Kang's\nhead? Truly a pipe dream. Seeing this,\nhis subordinate asked quizzically, \"My\nlord, could there be a trap in this?\"\nHearing that, he just replied calmly,\n\"There's definitely a trap.\" But on the\nother hand, it also shows that the\nenemy's forces are insufficient to\nassault Rotor City head-on. If that's\nthe case, we just need to defend the\ncity no matter what happens. Do not go\nout of the city to engage them. Right\nnow, most of our manpower is in the\nroyal capital. The destruction level\nmagic cannons on the city wall are our\ngreatest advantage. The continuously\nfiring magic cannons made the players\ndiscuss uncomfortably, \"Damn, uh, the\neffects in this game are topnotch. Stop\nblowing up. Keep moving forward. Watch\nout for the magic cannons. Brothers who\nrespawn, remember to find the priest for\na shield. Don't let the soldiers on the\nwall rest. We have to buy time for the\nlord.\" Sibbin, also observing the\nsituation from the outside, could only\nshake his head and sigh. The players at\nthe front are wasting their efforts.\nOver here, there are only two soldiers\nguarding the Sakin magic cannon. We can\nmake our move. Finally, Serakin got a\nchance to shine and quickly rushed\nforward with its size, saying eagerly,\n\"Hey, please watch me. Seraken, crush\nthese insects,\" causing the soldiers on\nthe city wall to scream in fear. \"Ah!\nEnemy attack! Fire the cannon quick!\nFire the cannon!\" Seeing that this was\nthe right moment, Roy immediately\nstepped forward to cast time stagnation.\nHe also began to assign tasks, everyone\nsplit up and eliminate the enemy.\nQuickly seize the city wall so they\ndidn't dare to hesitate, replying, \"As\nyou command,\" then dashed forward while\nthe enemy could only wonder in\nsuspicion, \"What? What is this?\" The\nenemy troops frantically asked, \"What's\nwrong with the cannon? Why has it\nsuddenly become so slow?\" Seeing this,\nhe also hurriedly reminded her, \"We've\nbroken through, Roy. You don't have to\nforce yourself anymore.\" At this point,\nshe was also exhausted, coughing with\nblood flowing out, trying to reassure\nhim. I I'm Fenick. You You go to your\nthing first. While he full of worry,\nlooked at her with pity and said, \"Don't\nsay anything. Rest. Leave the rest of\nme.\" Although it was extremely chaotic\noutside the city, the old man was still\nenjoying himself with some cortisans.\nOne of them even carefully reminded him,\n\"My lord, there are enemies.\" But he\njust replied indifferently, \"I know\nthere are enemies outside the city wall.\nNo need for that lovely face to worry.\nNow bring the snacks here. Let's play\nthe grape feeding game again.\" Hearing\nthis, a guard rushed in to report\nurgently, \"No, my lord, it's other\nenemies on the city wall. Our other city\nwalls have fallen. The enemy is\nincredibly strong. We can't fight back.\nWe can only be killed.\" Only then did he\nexclaim in a panic, \"Where's the mage\ncorps? Am I honor guard and sky\nknights?\" This man also reported\nhonestly, \"Your mage corps was\ntransferred to the royal capital.\" You\nsaid he didn't need an honor guard that\nthe maids were enough. The lord sky\nknight said that with the destruction\nlevel magic cannons, even a pig could\nguard the city wall. So they went to the\ntavern to drink. He trembled with anger\nand shouted, \"What? What these bastards?\nSo what am I supposed to do now?\" Then\nhe angrily pushed the cortisan in his\narms away, making her scream in pain. H.\nAt this moment, Sibbon had also found\nhis way to the old man's den and leaped\nin, saying, \"Look at this.\" Which made\nthe frightened old man quickly push a\nmaid in front of him to block the full\nforce of the attack, causing her to\nscream in agony. \"Uggh.\" Then he cursed\nangrily, \"Damn it.\" Next, this cunning\nold man stubbornly cast a special move\nto block his attack. Then said\nconfidently, \"This is a magic shield of\nthe archage level. I used the hide of a\nhigh-grade Blackwater crocodile magic\nbeast, a sophisticated and complex magic\nformation, and infused it with magic\npower for 7 days and seven nights to\ncreate it. Moreover, a second one has\nnever been made since if it could be\nshattered so easily by you, what would\nbe the point?\" Hearing that, he sneered,\npointed upwards, and asked, \"Can't be\nbroken, right?\" His attitude as icy as\never. He directly cast a skill and\nshouted, \"Smash it hard for me, Lord\nRotor.\" After taking a thorough beating,\nhad to hastily say, \"Stop! Stop! I\nsurrender, ug the system announced,\n\"Ting, the first phase of the attack,\nRotor City quest has been completed. All\nplayers have received 10,000 experience\npoints and three equipment enhancement\nvouchers. Please go to NPC King to use\nthem. Five equipment lottery vouchers.\nPlease go to NPC in X8 to use them. The\nprogress of the attack rotor city quest\nhas been updated. Phase two quest.\nLaunch an all-out assault. Quest\nrewards. Equipment enhancement vouchers\ntimes three. Equipment lottery vouchers\ntimes 5. 5,000 experience points.\nFavorability with Lord Eagle Crest plus\none. Quest reminder, please use the\nsiege rams to break open the city gate,\ncreating an attack opportunity for the\narmy under Lord Eagle Crest. People\nsuddenly cheered joyfully. The city wall\nwas broken by Lord Eagle Crest. Woo! I\ntold you. Why aren't the magic\ncannonballs firing this way anymore?\nBrothers, get the siege rams. Let's ram\nthe gate together. Realizing the\nopportune moment had arrived, he\nimmediately gave the order. All troops,\nadvance. The target is Rotor City, which\nmade everyone's morale surge upon\nhearing it. At this time, in a main hall\nof Rotor City's castle, Sibbin, who was\ngetting a shoulder massage from Lorie,\nsuddenly asked, \"How is Roy?\" The young\nlady then reassured him, \"Master, rest\nassured, I have used a healing spell on\nRoy. She will surely recover very\nquickly.\" However, the young lady\nsuddenly became charmingly suggestive\nand proposed, \"Master, there's no one to\ndisturb us right now. Why don't we\ncelebrate the victory?\" While he just\nreplied with an awkward smile, \"Now\ndoesn't seem like a very appropriate\ntime.\" Then she even took his hand and\npleaded, \"Please, master.\" Just then, a\nsoldier suddenly burst through the door,\npanting and shouting loudly, \"My lord,\nintelligence report.\" So the two of them\nimmediately separated as if nothing had\nhappened. He coughed dryly. If you have\nsomething to say, say it quickly.\nTherefore, the soldier didn't dare to\ndelay and directly reported, \"My lord,\nwe encountered two Aarons from Divine\nLight Town while searching for the\nsecret tunnels. They said they wish to\nsee you.\" He placed a hand on his chin,\nthinking to himself, \"Players from\nDivine Light Town. What are they doing\nhere? They're not planning to take this\nopportunity to kill me, are they? After\nall, my death outcome hasn't been\nresolved yet. To this day, we are still\nin an adversarial relationship. At this\nmoment, Lori from behind was still\nrelentlessly trying to entice him.\nMaster, come on now.\" Which has made him\nsmile, Riley. Finally, he stammered out\nangry. \"Bring them up.\" While Lorie\nbehind him had a dark, angry expression.\nAs soon as the two of them appeared,\nthey said in unison, \"Good evening, my\nlord. I have some intelligence that you\nwill surely find interesting.\" Hearing\nthis, he immediately perked up and\nasked, \"Speak. Let me hear it.\" The\nfrogman looked at him and seriously\nannounced as a reminder, \"This\nintelligence is a bit hard to believe. I\nhope you will listen seriously until I\nfinish.\" The first prince is actually a\nspecial vampire. He wants to use the\nsoldiers who died on the main\nbattlefield of the royal capital to\nsummon a necroantic cataclysm. At that\ntime, with the royal capital as the\ncenter, it will slowly spread until the\nentire Cologne Empire turns into a sea\nof undead and he will become the new\nundead monarch. As soon as he finished\nspeaking, he just replied flatly, \"Is\nthat all?\" Seeing his reaction, he was a\nbit disappointed and thought to himself,\n\"Lord Eagle Crest is indeed an\nunfathomably deep person. A secret that\nplayers like us need a system prompt to\neven know is fundamentally nothing to\nLord Eagle Crest.\" Immediately after, he\nsmirked slightly and thought to himself.\nI knew there was something wrong with\nthe first prince. After all, how could\nthe prince of a country be just an\nordinary person whose display panel the\nsystem can't see? He as long as I act\ncalm like this, as if I know everything,\nthen I won't have to give the players\nany reward. Then he put on an expression\nas if he knew everything. In the end,\nthe frogman had to give up and said\nsadly, \"It seems my lord already has a\nplan in mind. I was being mealsome.\"\nHearing that, Sibbon just replied\nstraightforwardly, \"It's all right. I\naccept the intelligence that you two\nwent through the trouble of bringing me.\nNow you too can state your request for\nreward. If it is within my capabilities,\nI will try my best to satisfy your\nrequest. His mood suddenly brightened up\nas he asked expectantly. As long as it's\nsomething within your capabilities,\nanything is possible. Therefore, he\naffirmed with certainty, of course. I,\nLord Eagle Crest, am first and foremost\na knight. The most important principle\nof a knight is honesty, which made the\ntwo of them suddenly fall into deep\nthought. Then the man named it didn't\nhesitate to directly propose, I want you\nto help us kill the Y-i-How guy. Which\nmade his friend beside him a bit\nsurprised and hastily ask, \"Kill Yihow?\"\nThis friend found it a bit hard to\nbelieve and kept pressing, \"Brother,\nI've never heard you talk about this.\"\nBut he just hurriedly replied, \"I'll\nexplain the reason later.\" Then he\nurgently asked, \"Lord Eagle Crest, can\nyou help me?\" While the other guy kept\nhesitatingly suggesting, \"How about we\ndiscuss it again?\" Meanwhile, he was\ndeep in thought. The Continent of Gung\nis a game world with extremely high\nfreedom. So in theory, it's also\npossible to kill the main character.\nFrom the fact that Lord Eagle Crest\ncould summon a portion of the players at\nwill, it could be seen that Yihow was\nnot indispensable because he had\nspeculated that up until now, basically\nno one could fully understand the entire\nplot. If Yiha is a character who\nundergoes a 180 degree change that the\nlater stages want to feature, then the\nplayers following him now are completely\nwasting their time. This hateful\nreaction from the player made him ponder\nto himself just how many evil things has\nthat guy E-how done to make even the\nplayers want to deal with him. But no\nmatter what, the main character is the\nlogin coordinate for the divine light\nplayers. If ei dies, it's hard to say if\nthese players can continue to exist. It\ncan't be because they want to come to\nLind Dong City, can it? Then he spoke\nwith some embarrassment this matter.\nJust then, the system suddenly issued a\nnotification. Death storyline mission\nhas been activated. Current mission,\nkill yehow on the king's battlefield.\nNote, the death story line has extremely\nhigh difficulty. Host, please prepare\nthoroughly. Completing the death\nstoryline mission can yield great\nrewards. Currently, Yihow has two fate\nmeridians. The host has two fate chains.\nPlease use them wisely. Ding. Daily\nvillain mission has been refreshed.\nVillain mission one, kill Anna, the\nvessel of war and fire. Villain mission\ntwo, inflict psychological trauma on the\nDivine Light players, excluding Uncle X,\nMio Mo, and Roundface Fat Chicken.\nVillain mission three, where the crown\nand ascend to the throne. Reading the\nmissions on the system panel, he\ncouldn't help but wonder to himself, did\nthat idiot not only offend the players,\nbut also the system? No matter how you\nlook at it, it seems like it was afraid\nI wouldn't agree. So, it forcibly added\na mission system. What you're doing\nisn't right. I'm a good person. How can\nyou give me a mission to user the\nthrone? Then a notification suddenly\nrang out again, but this time it was\nscolding him. Ding. As a villain,\nbackstabbing allies, stepping on the\ncorpses of your own league members to\nascend the throne. This is the art of a\nvillain, the backstabbing king. This\nmade him just laugh awkwardly and think\nto himself. The suggestion to deal with\nthe first prince is very tempting, but\nbackstabbing king sounds too harsh. More\nimportantly, my current military\nstrength is still not quite enough.\nFinally, the system gave a reminder.\nDing. The host only needs to complete\nthe death storyline mission first.\nShatter Yihow's son of fate body and\nleave the rest to fate. Deal with him.\nTherefore, he was certain of one thing.\nThe other things are optional. The main\nthing is to deal with Yih how. That\nidiot really did offend the system. Then\nthe frogman suddenly called out to him\nagain, \"Lord Eagle Crest.\" He thought\nfor a moment, feeling it wasn't a bad\nidea, then wave his hand as if to say,\n\"Move aside. Move aside.\" Then he\nwondered in confusion. If that's the\ncase, what's there to consider? And his\nfinal decision was, \"I agree to your\nrequest. I will help you kill ye how.\"\nWhich made one of them gasp in\nastonishment, while the other smiled\nfaintly in delight. A moment later,\nSibbon spoke tiredly. Although I said\nthat it's not urgent right now. The\nurgent matter now is when can my\nsubordinates finish organizing\neverything in the castle. I've been\nwanting to see just how much wealth that\nmarquee rotor has. A soldier suddenly\nran over to report. My lord, we found\nthis while searching Rotor Castle. He\nlooked at it with suspicion and asked,\n\"What is that?\" Then they directly\nuncovered the black cloth and said, \"My\nlord, please take a look.\" When the\nthree of them saw the person inside,\nthey all widened their eyes in\nastonishment and exclaimed, \"A\ndemihuman.\" It was the first time Lorie\nhad seen a winged race. But what caught\nhis attention was the thought, \"No, it's\nnot just that. This is an awakened\ndemihuman. Name by Yao. Status prisoner\nstrength awakened demihuman. Stage\nseason level 43 41 to 50. Skills:\nLightning defense sealed. Electric field\ncoverage sealed. Thunder pulse sealed.\nStorm current sealed discharge\nconstitution passive equipment prison\ngarb faction reputation demihuman eight\nbefore being captured she was just an\nunremarkable figure but she seems to\nhave another identity colon empire\nreputation minus 327 in rotor city. Many\npeople know that this strong willed\ndemihuman girl almost electrocuted\nmarquee wrote her to death to avoid\nbeing violated. But this feisty girl\nopened her mouth and immediately cursed\nhim relentlessly. Bastard, pervert,\nscumbag, beast, damn it, evil, which\nannoyed Sibbon, who thought to himself,\n\"Isn't this just a power generator?\"\nThis demihuman Lowly is a standard\nbattle mage model. Moreover, she has a\npair of wings, so she can most likely\nfly. While she kept cursing, disgusting,\nvile, shameless, despicable, low-life\nhumans. Meanwhile, he was lost in\nthought. If I can recruit her as a\nsubordinate, then I'll have my first\naerial military unit. But thinking of\nthat foul mouth spouting all those\nvenomous words, he became purple with\nrage and ordered, \"Lori, my sword. You\nwon't die a peaceful death.\" Because he\nwas thinking, \"It's better to just kill\nher. I'm not short on awakened\ndemihumans.\" Roy had to step forward to\nshut this foul mouth, which made her\nscream in fear. What do you want to do\nto me by Yao? MMP MPH MMP. At this\npoint, Sibbon had lost his patience. He\nlooked at her with a cold smile and\nreminded her, \"Please take a closer\nlook. I am not Marquee, wrote her. If\nyou still speak recklessly after seeing\nclearly, I don't mind plucking all your\nfeathers, chopping off your wings to\nroast and eat, and then cutting out your\ntongue, which made this girl panic. MMP\nMMP MMP. Next, he bluntly declared, \"I\nam Lord Eagle Crest.\" Rotor City has now\nbeen occupied by me. So, in theory, you\nare my prisoner of war, my spoil of war.\nAfter hearing this, Baya dejectedly\nuttered, \"Oh.\" Then he carefully\nreminded her, \"You can live freely.\nThat's fine, but you must join my army\nand serve me. As you can see, I have\nmore than one demihuman under my\ncommand. Besides Roy and Lorie, there's\nalso a merman named Tin Hai. Yet the\ngirl still looked at him suspiciously\nand asked, \"You say you're Lord Eagle\nCrest?\" The Lord Eagle Crest who\ndestroyed the demon's den in Xenmudong.\nThen she suddenly screamed, \"Ah, it\nhurts.\" Which annoyed him. Why do you\nhave to cry pain? But Bayao still said\nfirmly, \"You're Lord Eagle Crest. You\ncan't fool me. Next, she arrogantly told\nSibbon about the rumors she had heard.\nEveryone says Lord Eagle Crest is a\nhawk-faced demihuman with three heads\nand six arms over 10 m tall with a green\nface and yellow fangs. Although his\nappearance is ugly, he is kind-hearted,\nespecially coming to Jean Mu Dong to\ndestroy the demon's den to prevent\npeople from being deceived. How could it\nbe a human like you? Oof. Then she\ncursed him inwardly. arrogant,\ntyrannical, vicious, and evil. After\nhearing this, he angrily yelled in her\nface, \"Who are you calling ugly?\" The\nColon Empire is an empire of humans. How\ncan a master of the Eagle Crest\nterritory be a demihuman? Furthermore,\nbeing over 10 m tall isn't called a\ndemihuman. That's a titan. What do\ntitans have to do with demihumans? Who\nthe hell is spreading these damn rumors?\nHe even pulled her ear, making her cry\nout in pain. How would I know about\nthat? I'll temporarily believe you're\nLord Eagle Crest. All right. Thinking\nthat everything was settled, he finally\nproposed. Since you already know my\ntitle as Lord Eagle Crest, then there's\nnothing more to say. Join as my\nsubordinate. Your position will\ntemporarily be a maid. You'll follow\nLori and Roy. But the girl suddenly\nbecame stubborn and replied, \"Oh, that\nwon't do.\" Then she put on an arrogant\nexpression and said, \"Unless you invite\nme properly h you have to say,\nbeautiful, kind, and lovely Miss by Yao.\nI beg you join my command.\" This is the\nhonor of my lifetime. Sibbon was furious\nwith this girl and couldn't help but\nspeak up. Lorie's sword. I must chop her\nup today. But Roy had to hastily advise.\nYour excellency, please calm down. Lori,\ndon't give in the sword. Only then did\nBaya pout and speak up. Gez, I get it. I\nget it. But you have to remember you\nwere the one who actively invited me. I\njust felt sorry for you, so I\nreluctantly agreed. Bayo excitedly\nshouted off. Take it off. Her whole body\nemitted a strange light as she said\ncheerfully, \"Look quickly, Lord Eagle\nCrest.\" Then she happily ran over to Roy\nand boasted, \"Humpf! Humph! My whole\nbody is always in a state of discharge.\"\nMeanwhile, he she the sword in his hand\nand instructed with disdain, \"Roy, take\nthis silly girl to wash up and change\ninto different clothes. Then have her\nfollow you for now. If she doesn't\nlisten, just hit her. Remember to wear\ngloves to protect against the\nelectricity.\" So she just replied\nsoftly, \"Yes, my lord.\" Next, he sat\ndown and let Lorie give him a massage,\nignoring by Yao's scolding. \"You're so\nhateful. Aren't you going to ask my\nname, my identity, or if I have any\nfriends?\" But he just shued her away.\nWhen she was gone, he finally breathed a\nsigh of relief. Phew, it's finally\nquiet. However, in his mind, he still\nhad a hint of regret and curiosity,\nthinking to himself, \"Although I'm quite\ninterested in who the friends by Yao\nmentioned are, this girl is just too\nnoisy.\" As the guard were patrolling\naround, something suddenly rushed past\nthem, making them feel that something\nwas wrong, filled with confusion and\ndoubt. Meanwhile, this suspicious girl\nwas looking blankly, disappointed,\nthinking to herself, still not on this\nfloor. Finally, she secretly deduced,\n\"One more floor down is Lord Rotor's\nliving and resting area. There will\nprobably be more guards. I have to be\ncareful.\" Then she hurriedly left. But\nas she kept going without encountering\nany obstacles, she thought in confusion,\n\"Strange! Why are there no guards on\nthis floor?\" Then she suddenly heard\nvoices, forcing her to quickly hide\nbehind a wall. \"That person is really\nstrange, don't you think so?\" The girl\nsuddenly became alert and thought,\n\"Someone's coming.\" Roy replied in\nconfusion. \"What about it?\" Seeing this\nby Yao, who was still angry, was about\nto turn back to ask. \"No, I have to go\nback and ask why he didn't even bother\nto ask for my name. So Roy had to coax\nher. Let's go take a bath first. You can\nask next time. Uda, hiding behind,\nthought with suspicion this voice. It's\nby Yao. And she rushed out aggressively\nand demanded, \"Let her go.\" Which made\nRoy vigilant. She charged forward\nfiercely, extending her claws, which\nmade by Yao scream. H. But in an\ninstant, the person in front of her\ndisappeared, making her widen her eyes\nin shock and wonder. Disappeared?\nZulfast. Then she fainted from Royy's\nattack. Roy looked at the girl in front\nof her and uttered with suspicion.\nanother demihuman. Now realizing it was\nher friend, she was completely\nflustered. Ah, it's seeing this, Roy\nimmediately inquired, \"Do you two know\neach other?\" Bayo heardly replied, \"Of\ncourse we know each other. She's my good\nfriend. Why did you knock her out?\"\nHowever, she just explained frankly.\n\"Then do you know if it weren't for the\nfact that she had no killing intent, she\nwould be dead by now?\" From the Lord's\nstandpoint, her actions are no different\nfrom an assassin's who knew the Lord\nwould suddenly switch people. Roy also\nfound it reasonable and replied, \"That's\ntrue, I guess.\" After that, the two of\nthem carried you to away. Roy had to\ndecide, \"We'll have to trouble the Lord\nagain.\" Lorie won't treat her without an\norder. Meanwhile, by Yao, still full of\ndoubt, asked her, \"No matter what,\nthat's still a person. Do you really\ntrust him?\" Remembering Sibbon's image,\nher cheeks suddenly flushed red, her\neyes filled with infatuation as she\nshily replied, \"I'm because he is a\ntruly good person. My body and heart\nbelong to Lord Eagle Crest forever. Then\nshe smiled brightly and prompted, \"Let's\ngo.\" This left by Yao speechless,\nmuttering to herself, \"My, my lord.\"\nThen she chased after Roy, panting\nheavily, saying, \"Wait, slow down. My\nlegs are short. I can't keep up.\" Sib\nlooked at the two demihumans before him,\nand asked directly. \"So you two are the\nleaders of the Winter's Hollow Society,\nand your purpose for establishing it was\nto find more demihumans to go to\nWinter's Hollow City with?\" Bayao also\nadmitted in response, \"That's right. But\nbefore that, I was captured by that\nbastard Lord wrote her to hearing this,\nhe started to feel something was off and\nsarcastically implied, then aren't you\ntwo asking me for help? Why did someone\njust say that unless I beg her, she\nwouldn't join?\" This made her stammer\nand explain awkwardly that wasn't that\njust to get some better treat meant.\nSeeing this, Uda came to her friend's\nrescue. I hope you can be magnanimous\nand forgive her. I rushed to say by Yao\nbecause I was afraid her tackless mouth\nwould get her hacked to death. Hearing\nher friend say this. The girl cried out\nagrievedly. Uda while Roy and Lorie just\nnodded inside. That almost happened. At\nthis point, he could somewhat guess\ntheir personalities, thinking to\nhimself, \"These two have very opposite\npersonalities. One is hyperactive like a\nmad rabbit. The other is as tranquil as\nautumn water. But being crazy has its\nmerits. Compared to Bay Yao, this\ncalm-faced Uda has not completely let\ndown her guard. While Bayao is\nconstantly making a fuss and angrily\nasking, \"Are you listening to me?\" Uda's\nexpression remained indifferent as she\nreplied, \"No.\" The system panel then\ndisplayed the information, \"Name: Udah\nidentity. Vice leader of the Winter's\nHollow Society. Strength: Awakened\nDemihuman. Season stage LV41 LV 41 to\n60. skills. Feline grace, inseparable as\nshadow, sneak attack, silent and\nsoundless. Passive, light as a swallow.\nPassive, jade-like feet, passive\nequipment, common clothes, demihuman\nfaction reputation. Perhaps the Winter's\nHollow Society only has six members.\nImperial reputation two, a nobody. After\na moment of contemplation, he could see\nthat she was a standard assassin\ntemplate. Except for the last passive\nskill whose effect was unknown. The\nother skills were all for ambushing and\nassassination. It's just that with her\nbeing so vigilant right now, he couldn't\nget any effective information out of\nher. Then he stood up abruptly and\nasked, \"Are you too hungry?\" Which made\nthem confused and bewildered. He,\nhowever, casually suggested as usual,\n\"It's so late and we haven't eaten yet.\nI'm hungry, too.\" The kitchen has just\nprepared a sumptuous dinner. Why don't\nyou two join us? The girl by Yao looked\nat the table full of food and exclaimed\nin amazement. How sumptuous. Sib also\nput on a business-like smile. Go ahead\nand eat your fill. It's all right. This\nmay by Yao suddenly change her gaze and\nreply, \"You're not so bad after all.\"\nBut he had already calculated all this,\nthinking with satisfaction to build a\nrelationship. Table culture is the best.\nNoticing that the other party had\ngradually let down her guard, he\ndirectly asked, \"Since you want to join\nWinter's Hollow City, may I ask you a\nfew questions?\" Uda also cautiously\nreplied, \"If you have any questions,\nplease ask.\" Bay Yao, while eating,\nasked angrily, \"What? Why aren't you\nasking me?\" But he ignored her and\nasked, \"Uda, you have a skill called\ninseparable as shadow, right?\" After we\nfinished eating, can you demonstrate it\nfor me? The ignored girl could only\nwatch as Uda replied, \"All right.\" After\nthe meal was finished, she began to\ndemonstrate her skill. \"Please stand\nhere,\" Siban also complied, asking\nblankly like this. As she walked over,\nshe replied, \"That's right.\" Then she\nstepped into position. Then Roy shouted\nin surprise. She disappeared. Lorie\nexclaimed in amazement. She disappeared\ninto the shadow. He just let out a soft\nO. Sib asked with some curiosity, \"You\ncan enter shadows? What if the shadow\ndisappears?\" Uda reappeared and\nexplained, \"If there's no shadow, I will\nreappear.\" He then replied, \"So that's\nhow it is.\" He asked with some doubt,\n\"Is this a tracking skill? As long as\nthe opponent has a shadow, you can\nfollow them indefinitely regardless of\nobstacles.\" So she answered, \"Honestly,\nit can also be used for travel.\" Next,\nhe probed further, \"Does your winter's\nhollow society have other awakened\ndemihumans?\" She just replied softly,\n\"No, by yao star to scold shrewishly,\nwhere would you find so many awakened\ndemihumans? You should be thrilled to\nhave recruited the two of us. Besides,\nUda and I are both combat type\ndemihumans. We're very strong. Don't be\nso greedy. Uda added, \"Combat type\nawakened demihumans seem to be much more\ndominant.\" The other girl stubbornly\ncontinued. Winter's hollow city has four\nawakened ones. Only Lori is a support\ntype. You're lying, right? Huh? You\nalready have four people on your side,\nbut she was completely ignored. His eyes\nwere full of indulgence as he replied,\n\"It's fine even if there aren't any.\"\nYou will also join the maid corps\nworking by the remaining demihumans. I\nwill arrange for soldiers to escort them\nto Winter's Hollow City. For now, let me\nintroduce you. This is my personal maid,\nLorie. Consider her your superior. In\nterms of age, she's also your older\nsister. Normally, just do as she says\naccordingly. She stepped forward to\nintroduce herself. Hello everyone, I'm\nLorie Baya spoke up unhappily. Listen to\nher. Isn't she just a support type,\ndemihuman? which made you to quickly\nremind her. By Yao Sibbon happily came\nover, patted Lor's hand, and proudly\ndeclared, \"What? You think support types\nare weak? In the next battle, our Lori\nwill be the key.\" The next day, in a\ncertain part of the city, urgent calls\nsuddenly rang out. Are there any other\nunits that haven't assembled? Lord Eagle\nCrests and Earl Mong's units still\nhaven't arrived. Seeing this, he\nurgently declared, \"TK, did they fail?\nPass down the order. Stop waiting. March\nimmediately.\" Then suddenly, a\nsubordinate shouted in surprise, \"Ah,\ngeneral, they've arrived. It looks like\nthey've been through a fierce battle.\"\nSib, holding Lori tightly in his arms,\nhurried forward with his army. Seeing\nthis, the man gritted his teeth and\nthought to himself, \"What star of the\nempire? Is that all he is?\" To still be\ncarrying a maid at a time like this.\nWith morale this low, it's hard to say\nif they can even withstand the first\nwave of attack from the royal capital's\narmy. Then he couldn't help but silently\njudge. No matter how you look at it, he\njust seems like a good for nothing who\nrelies on his family's power to get by.\nJust like those silk clothed dandies in\nthe royal capital. What a pity, wasting\nso much military strength. Then he\nturned and asked him, \"Where is Earl\nMong?\" So he immediately started acting\nand replied, \"Your Excellency Kalin Earl\nMong was a true warrior.\" He led the\nvanguard to charge the city walls in the\nbattle for Rotor City. He even recounted\nwith tears welling in his eyes. However,\nEarl Mong was careless for a moment and\nwas unfortunately hit by a destruction\nmagic cannonball dying on the\nbattlefield. He's a true hero.\nMeanwhile, Lorie burst out laughing so\nhard her whole body trembled, forcing\nhim to signal a reminder. Lorie, don't\nlaugh. Kalin hurriedly came forward and\nreported respectfully, \"Your highness,\nall troops have assembled.\" The first\nprince heard this and praised with\nsatisfaction, \"Very good, everyone. You\nwork hard.\" Then he declared with great\nvigor, right now including us lords, we\nhave 21 sky knights. In addition, among\nmy subordinates, there are 23 sky nigh,\nmeaning a total of 44. But this number\nis still not entirely enough to confront\nthe pope's forces. But please rest\nassured to win this battle, I have also\ninvited the respected archment babosa\nhere along with 10 siege cannons made by\nthe dwarfs. Next, he pointed to the\nmysterious cloaked man and introduced\nthis is Archmidge 61 to 80 bibosa. His\nentire life has been focused on studying\nnecromancy. Earl Song Lang couldn't help\nbut say in surprise confusion, \"I didn't\nexpect that person to be a researcher of\nnecromancy. Wasn't that sect wiped out\nby the Church of Light? Why would the\nfirst prince invite someone like this?\nThat person will desecrate the remains\nof the warriors.\" When old Kalin heard\nthese words, he angrily shouted,\n\"Silence!\" The first prince also spoke\nwith empathy and understanding. I know\neveryone is very averse to things\nrelated to necromancy. It's just that\nspecial times call for special measures.\nWe need more sacrifices to wear down the\nenemy's forces and the undead are the\nbest choice. They can be revived\nindefinitely and are much more efficient\nthan a surely you don't wish for the\nsoldiers you've painstakingly trained to\nall die in the siege battle. After\nhearing this, the people below began to\nwhisper among themselves, their stances\ngradually wavering as they hesitantly\nreplied this, then looked at each other\nhesitantly, no longer objecting.\nFinally, they completely agreed. I I\nthink his highness's idea is very\ncorrect. Indeed, in special times, this\nis also because there is no other way. I\nthink if necromancy is used in the right\nplace, it's not that evil. Agreed. But\nSibbon remains silent in contemplation.\nThe first prince, seeing his goal was\nachieved, laughed heartily and said, \"I\nam very happy that everyone has reached\na consensus.\" At this moment, that old\nfox finally began to speak. Next, let's\ngo into the tent to discuss. After that,\nthey all entered the tent together to\ndiscuss tactics. Then, in front of\neveryone, Babosa demonstrated his\nability, causing them to discuss in\nconfusion. What was that scroll? What\nwas he doing? Seeing everyone's\nconfusion, he spoke up to reassure them.\nMy lords, there is no need to worry.\nThis is just a soundproofing barrier.\nNow everyone can discuss freely with\npeace of mind. The old man also began\nhis work with an announcement. Our\ncurrent siege forces only consist of the\ndwarf cannons and a few ordinary\ncatapults. But on the walls of the royal\ncapital, there are dozens of destruction\nmagic cannons. Without any preparation,\nit will be impossible to breach the city\nwalls no matter what. Therefore, we need\nto come up with some special plans to\nattack Dra Dragonfire City. Does anyone\nhave any ideas for this? Then a Lord\nsuddenly raised his hand to offer an\nopinion. We can dig a tunnel and attack\nDrag on Fire City directly from within.\nThe Pope would surely never expect it.\nThat way, we can catch them completely\noffguard. But after hearing these words,\nhe let out a sarcastic laugh. Your armor\nseems a bit small. It appears to be\nblocking the blood flow to your brain. I\nsuggest you change into a larger set. I\nhope you all will stop raising such\nfoolish issues. Dig a tunnel. Can't you\nsee the massive river protecting the\ncity? Are you digging a tunnel to drown\nyourselves? Earl Swang Lang also raised\nhis hand to give his opinion. Then, your\nexcellency Kalin, could we perhaps\npoison the river protecting the city? He\nalso nodded and replied, \"This idea is\nnot bad. However, although the river\nprotecting Dragonfire City is its only\nwater source, this river is too large to\npoison the entire river to a lethal\nlevel. The amount of poison required is\nsomething we simply cannot prepare.\nActually, to contaminate the water\nsource, you don't necessarily need\npoison. There is something even more\npotent than poison, which also doesn't\nrequire a large amount to be effective.\nThat is plague. Their insidious plan\nmade him ponder to himself a plague\nbecause of Dragonfire City's geography.\nI had already guessed that they would\ndefinitely make a move on the river\nsurrounding the city. But I didn't\nexpect them to use a plague for any\nterritory. This is a devastating\ncatastrophe, a difficult problem that\neven priests cannot solve. Even the\npurification spell has limited\neffectiveness. To completely eliminate\nit, one can only use the corresponding\nmedicine, holy water and the elves water\nof life. But what he despised the most\nwas this Kalin fellow who, in order to\nwin, was truly shameless and despicable\nwithout any limits. He even got angry\nand shouted when he saw the lords\nwhispering among themselves. If you have\nany problems, just say them out loud.\nDon't discuss them privately. He had\nsome doubts and spoke up to ask. Your\nExcellency Kalin, I want to know if the\nplague breaks out on a large scale, even\nour own soldiers will be affected. So,\nwhat should we do then? Everyone around\nenthusiastically chimed in. That's\nright. The Pope has holy water, but we\nhave nothing. This method isn't very\ngood. Although it's effective, it's\nreally too dangerous. Your Excellency\nKalin, we should think of another way.\nSuddenly receiving a series of opposing\nopinions left him able to only say\nhelplessly, \"You people.\" Then, Babosa\nreplied with a smirk. He he holy water.\nHe How much holy water can they possibly\nhave? The more severe the plague, the\nmore holy water it consumes. They can\nonly let their core forces use the holy\nwater. As for the ordinary soldiers, I\nguarantee they will definitely die. He\nhe giggled like a madman and said,\n\"Every hack hack hack. Everyone don't be\nafraid.\" He hack hack. I have the\nantidote for the plague. He don't be\nafraid. The river protecting Draon Fire\nCity originates from a stream formed by\nthe snow melt of the Fire and Mountain\nRange. We just need to spread the plague\nat the headarters of the stream. So, may\nI ask if you have any other opinions?\nUpon hearing this, that group of fence\nsitters replied, \"No, no more. If his\nexcellency Babosa says he has the\nantidote, then we have no more\nproblems.\" Me neither. Once outside,\nSibbons said nonchalantly, \"It would be\nstrange if he could actually produce a\nreal antidote.\" He suddenly remembered a\nvery important matter and quickly asked,\n\"Lori, I remember your ability can\nresolve all plagues, right?\" She also\nanswered honestly, \"That's right. Any\nplague could be eliminated using\nwithered wood rejuvenation. In addition,\nLori can also infuse the healing power\nof withered wood rejuvenation into\nwater. Although the effect will be\nslightly reduced, dealing with an\nancient infectious disease is not a\nproblem. So, the problem is considered\nsolved. He happily planted a quick kiss\non the bridge of her nose and exclaimed\nwith delight. You're so amazing. It's a\ngood thing you're here. This made her\nlips curve slightly into a giggle. He he\nthe soldiers of the pope's army were all\ncoughing. Cough, cough, cough. Some felt\nunwell and dizzy, panting heavily.\nOthers were nauseous and covered their\nmouths with their hands. Seeing this, he\ntried to reassure them. Everyone, don't\nworry. It's just a common cough. You'll\nget better after taking the medicine\nI've prepared. But the soldiers morale\nwas no longer stable. They were\nconstantly tormented by the discomfort,\ncrying out for help. I'd so itchy here.\nWhat the hell is this thing? Someone\nsave me. When he saw this scene, he ran\nout like a flash, shouting in panic. PLA\nplague. This is a plague comp commander.\nThere's a plague outbreak in the\nmilitary camp. This news was then\nurgently reported to his holiness the\nPope. Learning of this matter, the first\nthing he suspected was whether it was\ncaused by Kalin's group. His subordinate\nthen replied thoughtfully, \"I don't\nthink it could be Kalin's group because\na plague is very difficult to control.\nIf they were to spread a plague, it\nwould be no different from seeking their\nown death.\" Of course, if they have a\nway to avoid the plague, then that's\nanother matter. It's just that this\nsubordinate does not know of the\nexistence of such a method. Right now,\nonly holy water and the water of life\ncan completely eliminate the plague. The\ncorresponding medicine is also very\ndifficult to produce. Therefore, most\nplagues can only be controlled and\ncontained. I suggest having the sky\nnight level lords round up the sick\npeople. Guard them strictly. Those who\nare not sick, be careful not to use raw\nwater because all water sources in\nDragonfire City have been completely\ncontaminated. As soon as he finished\nspeaking, the atmosphere was completely\nstirred up and the soldiers couldn't\nhelp but feel panicked and worried.\nNext, the Pope asked with some\ncuriosity, \"How much holy water do we\nhave left?\" Hearing this, she also\nanswered honestly, \"Your holiness the\npope, we have over 100 L of holy water\nleft. It was previously used for the\nalchemists to research the plague, which\nmeans they used over 200 L of my holy\nwater, and in the end still couldn't\nsolve the plague problem.\" His every\nword made the subordinate tremble like a\nleaf, while she also answered honestly,\n\"Yes, your holiness.\" He roared with\nblazing anger, \"Utterly useless fools.\"\nSuddenly she asked with curiosity,\n\"What's that sound?\" One person pointed\noutside and exclaimed in panic, \"It\nsounds like it's coming from the city\ngate.\" Reort, \"Someone is attacking the\ncity.\" \"What?\" The massive cannons were\ncontinuously fired towards the sturdy\ncity gate. Sibon watched from a distance\nand couldn't help but exclaim in silent\nadmiration. Kalin is indeed a genuine\nwararmonger, understanding the principle\nof striking a man when he's down. He has\nsome brains at least. It's just this\nmethod of attack. I can't let my own\narmy sacrifice themselves in vain here.\nI can only let the players give a try.\nThen he suddenly reminded the players\nbelow in a stern voice. Remember, our\ngoal is to harass them. There's no need\nto sacrifice yourselves in vain. The one\nwho performs the best will receive a set\nof flame armor. Hearing this, they\nresponded with a resolute roar. We\nunderstand what's a little harassment.\nWe know it all too well. One person\nrushed to the front, puffed out his\nchest, and said with bravado, \"Let's go,\neveryone.\" Then suddenly, one person\nasked curiously, looking up at the sky,\nand pointing, \"Hey, brother Frost, look\nat that thing on the city wall.\" The\npope stood on top, filled with\nconfidence, chuckling, \"Don't waste your\nefforts.\" This city gate has a special\nshield added to it. Even if you fire\ncannons for three days and three nights,\ndon't even think about breaking it. But\nhe hadn't been laughing for long before\nhe was cursed and insulted by that group\nof players. Old man, come down here if\nyou've got the guts. Don't hide in there\nlike a coward. However, he still tried\nto suppress the fire of anger in his\nheart and sneered arrogantly. Did Kalin\nsend this bunch of shrimp to try and\nforce us to open the gate and meet them\nin battle? Don't waste your efforts.\nSeeing this, he could only sigh\nhelplessly and say, \"That old turtle\nhiding in his shell simply won't budge.\"\nBrother Frost also rolled up his\nsleeves, puffed out his chest, and\nreplied with bravado, \"You guys are no\ngood. Let me He then proceeded to\ndisplay his skill of scolding people as\nif singing beautifully. Drop dead pope.\nYou damn old geyser, an animal with an\nincompletely evolved colurectal anus. A\ngibbon with a mutated evolutionary gene.\nYou call yourself a pope being such a\ncoward. If you're so great, then come\ndown here and fight me. Are you hiding\non the city wall to show off your\nuselessness? Look at yourself. Your\nwrinkles could trap and kill a fly and\ndressing so godily. Who are you trying\nto put on a show for? After hearing\nthese words, the players could only nod\nin admiration. Brother Frost is the\nbest. Hey everyone, look at the Pope's\nhealth bar. Then they started buzzing\nwith discussion. His health bar\nappeared. Oh my god, level 68 nightmare.\nThe system panel also displayed his\ninformation. Pope Bakuda Kamura Skull\nPope 61 to 80, level 69mare.\nTo retaliate against these insults, he\nfuriously ordered archers fire for me.\nThis made them cry out, \"Holy crap, a\nsneak attack.\" Just like that, a series\nof attacks were continuously fired\ntowards these players, making them all\nflustered and panicking all over the\nplace. Get out of the way. Get out of\nthe way. Priest heal. What are you\nstanding there for? Does being low-level\nmean you don't know how to heal. Brother\nFrost, your door is really reliable.\nEarl Suang Lang was amazed by the scene\nbefore him and exclaimed in admiration.\nIt's truly hard to imagine. The soldiers\nunder eagle crest are also so brave and\nfearless of danger. Even their scolding\nis also so brave and fearless of danger.\nBut he just replied indifferently. You\nflatter me. Although he was impressed,\nhe still asked with some curiosity. But\nif we just keep scolding like this, when\nwill it start? The gate of Dragonfire\nCity is reinforced by a special force.\nIt can only be attacked from the inside.\nEven a super cannon can't blast it open.\nBut he just smiled nonchalantly and\nreplied, \"Don't worry, it will open on\nits own soon enough.\" This made him\nexclaim in surprise, \"What? What?\"\nHearing this, Kalin angrily shouted a\nreminder, \"War is not a game. I hope\nthat Lord Eagle Crest can do as he\nsays.\" But he didn't want to say much\nmore and just replied nonchalantly,\n\"Just wait and see.\" The Pope\ncontinuously had his soldiers fire\narrows, but he dodged them all and even\ntaunted him back. I dodge, I dodge\nagain. Then he laughed excitedly. He he\ncan't hit me, can you? Bald old man.\nWhat are you doing hiding on the city\nwall? Shooting arrows, showing off your\nuselessness, being taunted by him like\nthis. He flew into a rage and cursed.\nYou dregs. You will pay the price for\nyour ignorant stupidity. Then he\nunexpectedly jumped straight down from\nthe city wall towards them. His entire\nbody emitted an aura of killing intent\nand mighty power. Only now did he start\nto panic and wonder, \"Damn, why did this\nguy suddenly jump down here?\" Good thing\nI turned off the pain sensation\nbeforehand, so I can't feel the\nsensation of suffocation. But with his\ntrollish nature, he continued to taunt\nthe old man, bald old man, and then let\nout a mocking laugh.\" This made the old\nman go mad with anger and roar\nfuriously, your courting death. He then\nproceeded to unleash his move. The\nplayers seeing him leap down fearfully\nwhispered to each other, \"He's charging\ntowards us,\" \"Run quickly.\" But he just\nlaughed with interest and said in a low\nvoice, \"It's too late to run.\" On top of\nthe wall, the atmosphere suddenly became\nunusually quiet and Eugia was also\nslowly advancing towards them. Next, she\naggressively made a scene with this\ngroup of people. The Pope has personally\nleft the city to fight. \"You bunch of\ntrash. Why aren't you deploying?\"\nHearing this, they replied with some\ncaution. But I haven't received any\norders for us to go outside the city to\nengage in battle. Seeing that her words\ncarried no weight, she advanced and\nstabbed him once, then commanded with a\nscolding tone, \"You idiot.\" The pope\npersonally gave the order to wipe out\nthe enemy's den, and you're still\ndoawling here. Do you want to receive\npunishment by the holy fire of Sainis\nAnna? He began to panic and spoke\nfearfully, \"Holy fire, so you are\nSaintis, please calm your anger. We we\nwill deploy immediately. Just like that,\nthis bunch of clueless people hastily\nopened the entire city gate and rushed\nout together. The city, the pope, seeing\nthem charge over, flew into a rage and\ncursed, \"You idiots, who told you to\nopen the city gate?\" This left them\nbewildered, wondering, \"Didn't you say\nyou wanted the army to destroy their\nden? How do we get out without opening\nthe gate?\" The pope furiously asked,\n\"When did I say that? Get back here for\nme.\" Very quickly after, Sibbon's group\nswiftly blew up the city gate. This made\nthe Pope's subordinates even more\nbewildered as they hurriedly asked,\n\"Pope, what do we do now? The city gate\nhas been blown up. We can't get back\nanymore.\" The angry Earl Song Lang asked\nwith his mouth agape in astonishment,\n\"Lord Eagle Crest, you're really\namazing. The city gate actually opened.\nHow did you do that?\" But Sibbon just\nreplied blandly. It was just a\ncoincidence. Kalin couldn't wait any\nlonger and quickly interrupted, \"All\nright, now is not the time for this\ntalk. Right now, all lords, lead your\narmies and prepare to assault the city.\"\nHe didn't waste any more words, raising\nhis sword high and shouting, \"Generals\nof the Eagle Crest territory, charge.\"\nAfter that, they all fearlessly rushed\nforward in unison with the determination\nto win. Seeing the enemy formation\nsurrounding them, the Pope's general\nsaid helplessly, \"Hump, there's no way\nto retreat anymore. Everyone fight with\nall your might. He then raised his sword\nand shouted powerfully, \"Kill!\" seeing\nthe enemy gradually weakening. He\ncouldn't help but mock, \"The six\nsoldiers indeed can't withstand a single\nblow. What holy temper knights! They\ncan't even hold their swords steady. I\nthink they should be called truly weak\nknights.\" Hearing this, the pope flew\ninto a rage, pointed straight at his\nface, and cursed, \"You shameless\nbraggard!\" then attacked, causing the\ngeneral to scream in panic, \"Help! Save\nme!\" At the critical moment, Sibbon\nrushed over to block the blow for him\nand carefully reminded him that skeleton\ncan't stand being insulted by others.\nEarl Suang Lang, be a little careful. As\nfor the Earl, he lay sprawled on the\nground in fear, crying out in alarm.\nLord Eagle Crest. He walked directly in\nfront of the Pope and aggressively\ndeclared war. Hey, I advise you to\nsurrender quickly. If you surrender, I\ncan leave you with a whole corpse.\nHearing this, the Pope snorted coldly\nwhile Earl Song Lang's eyes sparkled as\nhe looked at him like a god, exclaiming,\n\"He looks so cool.\" As expected, the\nPope couldn't stand this humiliation and\nangrily cursed, \"You yellow-haired brat,\ncut the arrogance.\" Next, he unleashed\nhis technique, causing him to gasp in\nastonishment and think to himself,\n\"Space distortion, distorting space to\nteleport somewhere, just like the nun\nwho ambushed me before.\" While he was\nlost in his train of thought and didn't\nnotice the pope attacking him, Roy\nquickly rushed over to block the blow\nfor him and reminded him, \"Lord heavy,\nplease don't be careless.\" Her\nastonishingly fast appearance couldn't\nhelp but startle and surprise the pope\nas well. Roy looked powerfully at the\nenemy and asked in a low voice, \"You\nwant to compete in speed, right? Then\nlet's see who's faster.\" And then shot\nforward. This made even someone like the\nPope, who usually looked down on his\nenemies, marvel and exclaimed to\nhimself, \"Such fast speed.\" After a\nwhile of fighting, he couldn't help but\nwonder to himself, \"All my moves have\nbeen seen through. Could she also be an\nawakened demihuman?\" Realizing that\nfighting Roy was too disadvantageous, he\nturned to taunt him. You coward who\nclings to life and fears death to think\nyou'd let your maid fight on the\nbattlefield. Do you have any shame?\nHearing that, he just casually retorted\nto the pope. Can't be helped. I'm\nhandsome and have many maids. Are you\njealous? Just then, Lori appeared and\nreported, \"Master, I brought Bong Bong\nand thatchdow.\" The Pope was too shocked\nto speak you. Then, suddenly, a soldier\nran up breathlessly, calling, \"Your\nholiness the Pope. The soldiers affected\nby the plague have been greatly\nweakened, and moreover, the soldiers who\nwere killed have all turned in undead\nand are attacking us back.\" Only then\ndid he exclaim in horror, \"What does the\nenemy army have? A mage specializing in\nnecromancy?\" After a moment of thought,\nhe finally let out a soft sigh. \"TK, the\nsituation is too unfavorable. I must\nretreat first.\" This made the soldier\nask in confusion. \"Your holiness the\nPope. Then what should we do?\" The Pope\nthen suddenly shouted angrily. \"You all\ndefend the city walls for me.\" Hearing\nthat, the soldier cursed in frustration.\n\"Damn it, he runs so fast. These are\nundead. You can't kill them by slashing.\nHow are we supposed to defend now?\nSeeing this, Roy couldn't help but speak\nup angrily. This is bad. He wants to\nretreat. She even intended to give\nchase, but was stopped by Sibbon. He\ncalmly reminded her, \"Roy, there's no\nneed to chase. He can run, but the city\ncan't. The focus right now is over\nthere.\" Meanwhile, Hellfire was\nextremely annoyed and irritable,\ninstructing, \"You fishy worm. Do not\nshoot at the great Sarakan.\" Bong Bong\nalso obediently replied. Okay. Down\nbelow, Sibbon was holding Roy tightly,\ncausing her to blush shily. Bong Bong\ncontinued to let water flow out,\nflooding the area and making the\nsoldiers unable to stand firm due to the\nexcess water crying out in distress. The\nPope's men saw this and wondered in\nconfusion. Why is so much water suddenly\nappeared? Run, run quickly. While\neverything was becoming chaotic, one\nperson was happy. Deep how curled his\nlips slightly and thought to himself.\nFinally, I found her. The blue stars\nwill only told me the name and power\ncharacteristics of Tin High. This\ntrident has been unresponsive all this\ntime, and I didn't know where to find\nher. I got her without any effort. It\nturns out she is Tin High, but damn it,\nHellfire is beside her. It's not\nconvenient to make a move. At that\nmoment, Sarakin was furiously scolding\nher while she timidly shrank back and\nhurly said, \"Saw thee, TDo, Bong Bong,\nfought God.\" He hesitated,\ncontemplating, \"But I have no more\nchances to fail. The Grand Prince won't\nspare me. Neither will the Pope, and the\nblue stars will certainly won't let me\nlive.\" During the all-out assault, the\nbattlefield is chaotic. Hellfire can't\npossibly protect that demihuman named\nTin High forever. Right. I just need to\nstab this trident into tin high's heart\nand I can obtain the power of the sea\ngod Poseidon. At that time I can\ndirectly turn the tables and trample\nboth the grand prince and the pope under\nmy feet. Then Lord Eagle Crest will be\nnothing but a small fry that I can do\nwhatever I want with. The soldiers were\nstill boiling with fighting spirit.\nDon't stop the catapults brothers\ncharge. Keep it up. Then they work\ntogether to push the catapults to attack\nthe city gate and laugh cheerfully. Oh\nmy my goodness. Isn't this so exciting?\nThe enemy's cannons fired continuously,\nforcing them to raise their guard and\nrally their spirits, reminding each\nother the counterattack is here. Mage\nshields up. Warriors charged to the\nfront. On the Pope's side, it was no\nless fierce. A cloaked figure came\nforward and hastily issued an order.\nMove aside. Move aside. The magic cannon\nis launching its first wave of attack.\nFirst, the continuous earthshattering\nexplosions signaled a fierce and arduous\nwar between both sides. At this time,\nBong Bong was still very focused on\nchanting. H I L I A R E F E R A O I A L\nI N G-S. And Sarakan, who loved\ndestruction, was still closely\nprotecting her. Under her summons,\nlayers of water like vicious waves\ncontinuously submerged the enemy\nsoldiers, causing them to cry out in\nagony, but still trying to encourage\neach other. Ah, hey, hey, hey, hold on.\nTry to hold on. Just then, Sib\narrogantly walked over while holding\nLorie, sneering coldly. What's there to\nhold on for? The Pope has already run\naway, relying on a crumbling city wall,\nand you few small fry soldiers. You\nthink you can stop me? This made them\nexclaim in shock and horror. Lord Eagle\nCrest. However, one fearless soldier\ntook out a potion, drank it, and\narrogantly replied, \"Whether we can stop\nyou or not isn't for you to say.\" The\nbeast beside him, with its blood red\neyes, kept growling fiercely at him.\nSensing something ominous, Lori, full of\nworry, reminded him. Master quickly\nstopped them. I can feel that the potion\nthey're drinking is a stronger, modified\nversion made from demihuman blood.\nHowever, his expression remained as calm\nas water from beginning to end as he\nreplied with a slight curl of his lips.\n\"It's fine. It's an old trick of the\nchurch.\" Sibbon watched the Pope's men\nrecklessly use the enhancement potion\nand declare in a cold voice, \"Don't\nthink you're the only ones with\nenhancement potions. Today, I'll let you\nbroaden your horizons and see what a\ntrue shameless enhancement is.\" After\nthat, his whole body emitted an unusual\naura, causing them to exclaim in fear\nand panic. Is he crazy? What kind of\nenhancement is that? The system panel\nthen displayed his current status. Plus\n50 shield, plus 70 healing, plus 90\nspeed. He grinned and instructed, \"Lori,\nyou wait for me over here.\" So, she also\nreplied very obediently. \"Yes, master.\nBe careful.\" Next, he advanced, raised\nthe sword high, and arrogantly declared,\n\"This is what real hacking is.\" Sibbon\nthen shot forward to fight, making them\nexclaim in astonishment and panic.\nZulfast, even after transforming, we\ncan't keep up with his movements. If\nthis continues, we won't be able to hold\non. While he was busy attacking these\ngroups, one of them took the opportunity\nto lunge towards Lori, extending its\nfangs and claws, saying, \"If this is the\nwork of an enhancement, then let's deal\nwith the support first.\" He noticed\nsomething was wrong and turned to shout\nworriedly. Lori, just in that\nhairraising moment, a familiar shadow\nappeared and spoke in a powerful voice.\nJust do as we discussed before. You can\nfight without worry. How about this\nside? It then quickly revealed its true\nform, standing protectively in front of\nLorie, leaving him to only exclaim in\namazement. So reliable, you duh. Bachj\nalso appeared, snorting coldly and\npouting as she spoke, praising him\nalready. Isn't it a bit too soon? Her\nentire body continuously discharged\nterrifying electric sparks making him\nunable to remain calm. His mouth agape\nin astonishment. The girl confidently\nspread her proud wings, flew up and\nsaid, \"Watch me. Here I come.\" Next, a\nterrifying aura was seen being released\nfrom her body. It was so large that it\nmade the papal army soldiers scream one\nby one. A what is this? And of course,\nwith her releasing it so uncontrollably,\neven Sibbon was no exception, he was\nzapped and cried out in pain. Ah ah ah.\nThen hurriedly reminded her, \"You don't\nhave to go that overboard. Look\ncarefully before you discharge\nelectricity.\" \"Yet Boach just scratched\nher ear, pretending to be careless,\" and\nreplied with a smile, \"Oh dear, it was\njust a small mistake. Next time! Next\ntime for sure.\" Making him so angry, he\ngritted his teeth. And you duh, afraid\nhe would get too mad and beat up his\nclose friend, reluctantly spoke up. I\nhope you can forgive her. Lorie, at this\nmoment became quite fierce, surprising\nthe men beside her. How did she achieve\nsuch a fast speed like that? But they\ndidn't know that it was because she had\nsmelled the fresh blood of her kin on\nthem that she became so enraged.\nCarrying her hatred, she immediately\neliminated all those who dared to harm\nthe demihumans. After finishing, she\nimmediately turned her head. Lord Heavy,\nthis side has been cleaned up. He stood\nabove, looking down and pondering. I\nnever expected there would be a day I\ncould win by doing nothing. I I\nbasically don't need to lift a finger.\nJust the maid squad alone could\ninstantly eliminate more than half. It\nseems this battle will end faster than I\nthought. At this moment, down in the\nbattle, it seemed there was a man with\nulterior motives, just as the will of\nthe blue star had said. All he needed to\ndo was use this trident to stab the\nheart of a demihuman named Tinh High.\nThe will of the sleeping sea god inside\nwould use her as a vessel to awaken. And\nas the one who helps the sea god, I will\nreceive the help of a deity. My current\nlevel is 57, completely comparable to\nthe level 55 hellfire lord. So this is\nmy chance to carry out the task of\nresurrecting the sea god. After that, he\nimmediately thrust the trident straight\nforward. Receive the judgment of the\ngods. Tinhai saw this and was startled.\nBut luckily, the golem beside her\nappeared just in time to block it. Being\nthwarted, that guy clenched his teeth.\n\"Damn it!\" he looked at him and roared.\n\"Where did this riff raff come from to\ndare challenge the great Sarakan?\" After\nthat, he was very thoughtful and created\na cage to help Tanh High escape. The\nother guy now felt the flames begin to\nengulf his body and felt immense pain.\nBut because of the divine guidance, he\nremained very tough and retorted, \"It's\njust a block of rock. quickly hand over\nthe mermaid in your hands to me.\nHowever, because he talked too much, he\nwas punched into a wall by Sarakin. But\nnow, that guy didn't feel discouraged,\nbut laughed loudly. So, this is your\nweak point. And so, he immediately\nrushed forward and attacked Srakin's\nchest directly, causing him pain. That\nguy became more and more smug. Your\nheart is just like your nature, both\nfoul and hard. After finishing his\nmockery, he immediately stabbed his\nblade straight towards the heart stone.\nThe power he put into it caused his\nheart to crack instantly. Tin high\ninside the protective membrane saw him\nsacrificing himself to protect her and\ncried her eyes out, \"Don't stone head.\"\nThat guy now became smug. You might as\nwell hand the mermaid over to me.\nOtherwise, two more strikes at most and\nyou'll be in hell. Upon hearing that, he\nflew into a rage. Go to hell, you riff\nraff who doesn't know what's good for\nyou. I have sacrificed countless times.\nThe flaming army has never feared\nsacrifice. Hearing that, he didn't care\nand decided to deliver the final blow.\nTinhei screamed at this moment. Stone\nman, let me go if this continues. You\nwill really die. But Sakin didn't bother\nand directly took out his own heart,\nthrowing it straight at the bastard in\nfront of him. Along with that, his\nentire body was quickly disintegrating.\nSeeing this, tears quickly fell from the\nmermaid stone head. Can you tell me the\nstory about that place again? Although\nhe found it very troublesome, he still\npatiently told stories to the little\nmermaid girl in front of him, making her\nhappy. At that time, she even thought\nthe two of them were best friends\nforever. Although there were times he\nwas a bit hot-tempered, to her, he was\nstill the first friend. After his heart\nwas separated from his body, it\nimmediately created an explosion that\nattracted the attention of others.\nSibbon also quickly looked in that\ndirection. What happened over there? who\nis in charge of that city wall section.\nAt this moment, the system reminded him\nagain, detected that the hellfire lord\nhas died. Soul has been recovered.\nHearing this, he knew something bad had\nhappened on the opposite side and led\nhis two maids to go there and assess the\nsituation. After moving for a while,\nthey also arrived at this area. Sibbon\nlooked at his maid and reminded her,\n\"Lori, don't waste your energy. He's\nalready dead. Go find where Tin Hai is.\"\nWhile searching, they saw deep how lying\nto one side with the trident stuck in\nhim. Sibbon looked at him and wondered\nthis blue flame. It seems the one who\ncaused Saken's death is him. Regardless\nof what relationship he has with the\npapal state since he has eliminated my\nsubordinate and the whereabouts of\nbubble are unknown, I cannot forgive\nhim. Just as he was about to deal with\nthat son of heaven's mandate, Lorie also\nfound Tin High in an unconscious state.\nWhile Sibbon was about to finish off the\nman in front of him, he was called out\nto buy his maid. Rui looked at the stone\nslab in her hand. Please take a look at\nthis stone fragment. It has very\nmysterious patterns on it. This is the\ncore of the Hellfire Lord. He must have\ntorn out his stone heart to\nself-destruct in order to protect\nBubble. Sibbon went to ask Lorie about\nBubbles's injuries, although they were\nnot serious. Lorie was at a loss because\nshe refused to leave Stonehead's body.\nSeeing that, Sibbin asked the system,\n\"Can Sakan be resurrected?\" According to\nthe systems notification, he needs to\ncollect enough materials to be able to\nresurrect him. Hearing this, he sighed,\n\"It's good that he can be resurrected.\nIf he had just died like that, I would\nhave lost a talented general.\" After\nthat, he asked about the materials to\nresurrect him. According to what the\nsystem said, he needs a highlevel\ndemon's heart along with 10 tons of\nspirit steel. After that, a master level\ndwarven craftsman is also needed.\nHearing this, his expression immediately\nstiffened. Do I have to use a living\nperson as a material? Is this okay? The\nsystem continued to report, \"The\ntechnology to recreate a hellfire is\nextremely complex, especially the\nprocess of crafting the lava heart. Even\nif the system provides the plan,\nordinary human craftsmen still cannot\ncreate it. So, the host needs to find a\nmaster level dwarven craftsman.\" Hearing\nthis, he immediately felt better because\nat least it wasn't about cooking a\nperson to become a material. While he\nwas pondering, Ruer quickly rushed up to\nhim. My lord, be careful because at this\nmoment, Deepow appeared from nowhere and\nwas approaching him. What? That guy\nhasn't gone to see the king of hell yet.\nHe has a long life. But at this moment,\nhe sensed something was not right. Does\nthat appearance look like he's alive?\nWhat on earth is happening? Rule looked\nat him and shook her head. I felt a\nstrange aura constantly coming from that\ndirection. So, I went to check. As a\nresult, Deep House suddenly stood up.\nSticky tentacles grew out of the wound\nwhere he was stabbed. Luckily, I stopped\nhim and came back here. I don't know\nwhy, but I have a feeling that I can't\ntouch him. That's understandable.\nLooking at his state, it would be\nstrange if you touched him and didn't\nget infected. It turns out the main\ncause is the sea gods trident stuck in\nhis chest. At this moment, thousands of\neyes appeared from nowhere surrounding\nSibbon. He also began to become\nunconscious. Why am I still in one piece\nhere? But luckily, Ruer, who was beside\nhim, promptly stepped forward to stop\nhis self-destructive act. Lorie also\nappeared by his side and immediately\nused her life force to revive her\nmaster. Sibbon now regained his senses.\nI'm fine. Thankfully, it's because of\nyou girls. Perhaps I was affected by\nthose enchanting words just now and\ncouldn't control my thoughts. I feel\nthat I can't face that guy head on. At\nthis moment, a line appeared on his\ninformation panel, which was that he was\nbeing infected. The system also\nimmediately warned that if his tentacles\nhit someone, the infection rate would be\nvery high. Having no other choice, he\ncould only charge forward to eliminate\nthe dangerous man in front of him. Each\nflame on his sword seemed to ride the\nwind, lunging straight at him. After\nthat, he also prepared to use another\nultimate skill to control Deep How.\nSibbon looked at the man in front of him\nand immediately cast his ultimate skill,\nchains of fate. The two maids looked at\ntheir master with a confused expression.\nBut this did not stop the chains of fate\nfrom rushing forward to bind deep how\ntightly. He was immediately enveloped by\nthe chains in the center. But he was\ntied up in a way that couldn't be more\nBDSM. The maid saw this and immediately\nthought of a scene that was not very\nbrute. Lori also exclaimed, \"Last time\nafter seeing him tie someone like that,\nI went and asked Christy. She said,\n\"It's the turtle shell time method. If\nthe master likes this style, maybe next\ntime Lori can do it, and perhaps I can\nask for a baby with him.\" Rule beside\nher remained very serious. Don't let\nyour guard down. The master is still\nfighting. He hasn't allowed us to go\nover and help him. Although it looked\nlike he had been suppressed, the ominous\nfeeling coming from deep how hadn't\ndiminished much. Sib was very confident\nat this moment. These chains are indeed\neffective, unexpectedly suppressing his\nlevel down of 40. If it weren't for this\nancient infection, it might have dropped\neven further. But this is enough. Just\nlevel 40, I can eliminate him with a\nwave in my hand. With the confidence he\nhad, he quickly used his fire sword to\nattack. But no matter how many times he\nattacked, the ancient infection was\nstill constantly helping him recover.\nSeeing that, he was surprised. What is\nthis situation? Is it impossible to\ndestroy him? Do I have to destroy him a\nfew more times to deplete the energy in\nhis body? Or do I need to use some\nspecial method if he couldn't let the\nmaids help? Ah, that's right. Didn't he\nhave a group of people who weren't\nafraid of being infected? So, he quickly\nused the systems function to announce a\ntemporary epic quest for the players.\nThey were immediately overjoyed upon\nreceiving the system notification.\nHowever, only Lynn fan was very\nclear-headed. Does everyone feel like\nmaybe our side is the one starting the\ngame normally? The game's name is the\ncan continent, not invasion war. So from\nthe king continent's perspective, it's\nvery likely that Lord Eaglerest is the\nprotagonist. To Lord Eaglerest and this\ncontinent, we players and yehow are\nactually the invaders. This could also\nexplain why the game's difficulty\ndecreased when we joined the forces of\nLambdong City. At this point, they\nimmediately went to the battlefield\narea. Found him. Is that Yeha? Oh my\ngod, it hasn't been that long. How did\nthat guy turn into a transforming worm?\nSeeing his appearance like this, I can't\nbelieve he's a protagonist. While they\nwere still in heated discussion, the\nancient curse quickly targeted them. It\nquickly affected their minds. There are\nstrange sounds ringing in my ears. Can\neveryone hear them? It feels like those\neyes of Yehow are making me nauseous.\nBut for the players, this wasn't a big\nproblem at all. For the sake of the\nquest, they charged forward to attack\nlike madmen without a thought for the\nconsequences. Even the mages wanted to\nuse their magic to burn that guy. This\nscene was considered quite cruel even to\nSibbon. But luckily, it seemed the\nancient infection was ineffective\nagainst those players. Rule looked over\nwondering why did Jiha turn into such a\nstate and that golden trident on his\nbody. I've seen in the ancient text\nbefore it seems to be the sea god's\ntrident. Hearing this, Sibbon's eyes\nimmediately thought of something. Isn't\nthe sea god an ancient one? Rule quickly\nexplained her master. Those are the old\ngods. The ancient texts record that the\nold god who fought the sea god was o twe\na because he always fought at night. He\nwas also known as the dark walker. It's\nsaid that his energy is weakened under\nthe strong sun. Moreover, he hates\nstorms which is why he only fought the\nsea god at dusk. Hearing that, Sibbon's\neyes filled with contemplation. Is that\nso? I thought that trident was the\nsource of the ancient power. I didn't\nexpect it to be an enemy. Could it be\nthat a conflict between the two sides\narose within Yiha's body, causing him to\nbecome like this? The trident is an\nexternal force, which means Yihow\nhimself must have a connection with O\ntweet a whether he's a kinsman of the\ndark walker or something else. According\nto the hierarchy of power, Yiha must\nalso be afraid of the sun and storms. He\nthen looked towards the sunset, but it\nwas already dark now. Where could he\nfind the sun? It's a stormy night. Ru,\ndo you think it's possible that what O\ntweet a hat hates isn't the gales and\nrainstorms, but the fierce lightning\nthat has extreme properties similar to\nthe scorching sun? Hearing his\nsuggestion, she also quickly fell into\nthought. I've never thought of this.\nWhat does a master said have to do with\na person down there? Sib then showed a\nconfident smile. If I can't find the sun\nnow, I can just create a generator.\nWhile the three of them were still\nthinking of a way, a figure appeared in\nthe space. Bakdu looked at him angrily.\nWhat's wrong? What are you looking for\nme for? Sibon understood that girl's\npersonality, so he immediately started\nflattering her. Of course, I'm looking\nfor the lovely, beautiful, kind, and\ngentle young lady to reluctantly help me\nwith something. Hearing his words, her\nnose quickly pointed to the sky. You\nthink saying that will make me help? I'm\nnot the type who likes to hear this kind\nof sweet talk. It's nauseating. I'll\nhelp you with official business. Go on.\nWhat needs to be done? Sib pointed\nforward and suggested, \"It's simple. Use\nyour lightning ability to see if you can\ndestroy that monster. Bakju looked over\nin horror. What the hell is that thing?\nIt's so disgusting. I feel like\nattacking it will contaminate my\nlightning. Seeing that girl being so\ndifficult, Sibbon was about to lose his\ntemper, but was stopped by Lorie. Bogu,\nwe're counting on you. We can't touch\nhim. We can only rely on you. Being\nspoken to like that, the girl was\npraised to the high heavens and\nimmediately agreed. All right, Fine.\nSeeing as you're all so sincere, I'll\nhelp this time. After speaking, she\nimmediately charged straight towards\nEihow. All of you get out of my way.\nSeeing her appear, they were completely\nsmitten. Is this also a reinforcement\nsent by Lord Eagle Crest? She's so cute.\nBaktu, however, didn't care about their\ngazes and quickly used her lightning\nability on the monster in front of her.\nReceiving the baptism of lightning,\nYiha's entire body emitted unpleasant\nsounds. The other players felt a\nheadache upon hearing his calls. But for\nthem, this had almost no effect. The\nmost surprising one was still Boku. It\nseems she wasn't swayed by the ancient\ncurse and continued to use her skills to\nattack. Just as she was about to deliver\nthe finishing blow, she was blocked by a\nplayer's arm. It seems they were\nmesmerized this time, causing them to\nsee her as an enemy and attack. Sib saw\nthis scene and immediately rush forward.\nThis is bad. After that guy's enchanting\nwords grew stronger, even the players\ncan't control themselves. It was indeed\nthe case. They were completely unable to\ncontrol their bodies even though their\nconsciousness remained. Luckily, Sibbon\nappeared in time to block his blade.\nThen he used his flames to punish the\none who dared to be disrespectful to\nBachu. Sib looked around in\ncontemplation. This is troublesome. If\nit were just the players, it would still\nbe fine, but now there are also a large\nnumber of warriors affected by the\nenchanting words. If they keep attacking\nlike this, I'm afraid they won't have a\nchance to be revived. But when he looked\nat Bach Du who was still fiercely\ndealing with those who touched her, he\nknew he didn't need to go over and help.\nBut now that I think about it, it seems\nshe isn't affected by the ancient\ncurses. Even though Lorie isn't\nconsidered to have the ability to purify\nenchantments, Rue Fi, how directly in\nsingle combat and wasn't infected. Now\nwith Bach Du added to the list, all of\nthem can ignore that enchantment, which\nproves that awakened demihumans have a\ncertain resistance to these charms. And\ncould the fact that awakened demihumans\nare chosen to become vessels be related\nto this nearperfect resistance? He then\nlooked at his two maids. This is well\nworth a try. Seeing her master looking\nat her, Rueer immediately asked, \"My\nlord, is there something you need help\nwith?\" Sib smiled mysteriously. \"Rue,\nyou take Lori and move all the warriors\nin the center to a place 100 meters\naway.\" Lori, use your purification art\nto temporarily control them on the outer\ncircle. Remember, you must deal with\nthem cleanly in a moment. Receiving the\norder, the two of them immediately left\nto carry it out. Then he looked at Bachu\nand ordered stop. If you continue like\nthis, someone will be sacrificed. I\nremember you have a move called\nencircling electric field, right? Don't\nhesitate. I believe you can do it. Baku\nwas suddenly embraced by him and became\ndazed. All right, then. Let me give it a\ntry. But what about the people blocking\nthe way on the outside? Siban looked at\nher and reassured her, \"Don't worry,\nI'll help.\" And so he counted from one\nto two and threw the girl's entire body\ninto the vast sky. After doing so, he\nlooked towards Ruer to ask if her side\nwas cleared out yet. Rui replied while\nfighting, \"Yes, it's all cleared.\" And\nso she used her legs to kick a player\nout of the area. Sibbon received the\nsignal and immediately ordered Bach due\nto act. And so she quickly created an\nelectric field that enveloped Yihow. A\nmassive bolt of lightning was\nimmediately released, striking his body.\nNot only that, but it also spread to the\nmesmerized players. Baktu paid them no\nmind and continued to intensify her\nlightning. It quickly spread around,\nroasting the very air. But it seems\nbecause her control wasn't good, that\nlightning bolt was also aiming for\nSibbon. Seeing this, he quickly dodged.\nThis accuracy isn't very good, is it?\nBaktu looked at him angrily. What did\nyou say? That's because the power was\ntoo great this time. It consumed a lot\nof my stamina and energy. Knowing this\ngirl wanted him to praise her, Sib had\nno choice. All right, beautiful and kind\nyoung lady. You've worked hard. Rui then\napproached from a distance and asked,\n\"Bakyu, has Eihow been eliminated?\" She\nnodded affirmatively. Of course, my\nelectric field is no joke. Everyone,\nlook at his state. There should be no\ndoubt anymore. Sib stepped forward to\ninspect. It's over. I didn't expect the\nchild of destiny to turn into a pile of\nashes. Although it was a relationship of\nhim or me, this guy was truly unlucky.\nHe then quickly asked if the quest was\ncomplete and the system also appeared to\ncongratulate him. Host has completed the\nfirst main story quest. Now presenting\nthe first reward to the host, Sibbon\nlooked at the crystal in his hand, very\nhappy to receive this item. While he was\nstill thinking about getting a few more\nrewards, the system warned him to leave.\nHearing something was wrong in the\nsystems words. His whole body trembled.\nAt the same time, the surrounding space\nwas quickly enveloped by a wave of blood\nlust. It created a terrifying pressure\nthat weighed down on the three of them.\nKnowing there was no time, he quickly\nasked the two maids beside him if they\nwere okay. Even in this situation, Ruer\nstill knew how to joke. Everything else\nis fine, just that my clothes are a\nlittle torn. Bachd, on the other hand,\nwas not fine at all. She cried out, \"I'm\nover here. Can someone come help me?\nSibbon was also helpless with that girl\nand immediately pulled her out of the\nground. Looking at her, he teased,\n\"You're covered in mud like this.\"\nHearing that, she looked at him sulky.\nIt's all your fault that I'm not clean\nanymore. Really, even so, this matter\ncould only be blamed on Yeha. But\nconnecting the dots, it felt like the\none taking the blame had actually come\nout ahead. Ru looked at the girl and\nreminded her, \"It's okay. You can just\ngo back and take a bath.\" At this\nmoment, the system suddenly started\nworking normally again, which made\nSibbon feel confused. Congratulations to\nthe host for obtaining half a piece of\nthe mysterious crystal. Congratulations\nto the host for receiving special\nrewards. Please review. Looking at what\nhe had obtained, he was very happy. Oh\nmy, this thing really is the cut on this\nhalf piece of the mysterious crystal.\nYou could tell at a glance it was\nforcibly broken in two. I'm not an\nidiot. This thing is identical to the\npiece I almost gave to Ruer. The system\ntook it from E-How, right? Besides, it\nwas clearly a complete crystal to begin\nwith. This also means that the\nfluctuation just now was most likely two\npowerful forces fighting over that\ncrystal piece. And the force behind the\nsystem ultimately only managed to snatch\nhalf. If that's the case, once the\nsystem completely analyzes this half\npiece of the mysterious crystal, I\nshould be able to summon 5,000 players.\nThinking of this, his gaze became more\ndetermined. the number of players might\nincrease to 5,000 and I don't know if\nthat's a good thing or a disaster, but\nthat's a problem for later, not\nsomething I need to worry about now.\nLet's continue to check the two\nremaining rewards. The first is an angel\nsummoning skill. Seeing its effect,\nSibbon was overjoyed. Well, well, this\ntime a systems item is quite to my\nliking. Even though I can only command a\nlegendary grade how angel for half an\nhour, it's enough to drag the pope out\nof the royal palace and annihilate him\n100 times. However, the name How Angel\ncouldn't help but remind one of Eihow.\nThinking of that, he immediately felt a\nheadache to the surprise of the two\nmaids. Sib looked towards the distant\nsky and pondered, \"Although I now have\nthe qualifications to be reckless, I\ncan't be careless. After all, I still\nhaven't figured out the first prince's\ntrue identity. What if I go overboard\nand scare the first prince to death? You\nhave to know that an enemy in the open\nis much easier to deal with than an\nenemy in the dark. Bakd for some reason\ncame forward and disrupted his thoughts.\nHey, I'm talking to you. Don't just put\nyour hand anywhere. My head is not a\ntable. You definitely did that on\npurpose, didn't you? Sib looked at the\ngirl and quickly tried to sweet talk\nher. Really? Really? How could I have\ndone it on purpose? But his actions made\nher angry and she zapped lightning\neverywhere. You troublesome guy. Don't\ntry any perverted tricks on me. The two\nmaid saw their master getting zapped\nbadly and came forward to ask. But with\nhis current strength, he wasn't worried\nat all. It's just that I was thinking\nabout how to fight the next battle. It's\na bit troublesome. Hearing this, Ruer\nalso became more serious. This is indeed\na difficult problem. The situation\nbefore was clearly not bad, but after\nbeing disrupted by Yihow, most of the\nsoldiers fell into a coma. After the\ndemihumans were suppressed, only a few\nwere left. Seeing her so pensive, Sibon\nimmediately comforted her. Oh, forget\nit. Thinking too much is useless. Since\nthings have come to this, let's just go\nwith the flow, withdraw from the\nbattlefield, and observe the fight for\nnow. At this time, back in the\ncathedral, a bunnyeared girl was praying\nto the gods when she was interrupted by\na panicked shout. Anna, Anna angrily\nlooked at him. Even if you were his\nholiness, the pope, interrupting a\nsacred prayer is completely improper.\nBut the old man had no time and pointed\nstraight at her. Anna, what is the\nsituation with your awakening? Those\ndamned rebels dared to use a scheme to\nattack Fire Dragon City. And that Eagler\nCrest Lord is also a difficult one to\ndeal with. Hearing that, Anna frowned. I\nhave now reached the threshold of the\nsecond stage. Although I broke through\nthe first stage using a divine relic to\nbreak through the second stage, I need\nenlightenment. Enlightenment is like a\nfoundation. Without this foundation, I\nwill fail no matter how many divine\nmiracles there are. The Pope heard that\nand quickly asked, \"Then what must I do\nto help you?\" Hearing that, she smiled.\nTo receive the blessing of the god of\nwar and red flame, there must be a\nbattle that shakes people's hearts. If\nthey want to start a war, then let those\nrebels come to the royal capital and\nstart one. A true battlefield is the\nopportunity for my enlightenment. At\nthat time, I will become the most\nperfect vessel for my master. If you\nknow what to do, then go quickly. My\nmaster and I are both waiting. At this\nmoment, on another side, the zombies\nwere still roaring continuously. Looking\nover, the people above were discussing.\nYour highness, the prince, you should\nlet Lord Boza stop. The number of undead\nis increasing. What if they can't be\ncontrolled later? But at this moment,\nthe prince couldn't be bothered. If they\ncan't be controlled, then just let them\nbe. After all, these are my best chess\npieces. The other person was stunned to\nhear this. Your highness, you will\nbecome fangs and claws for the undead.\nBut this man couldn't be bothered. So\nwhat if I was the firstborn? This empire\nwas built on marshall strength, but I\nwas just a monster with no talent. So\nnow that I have enough power, I can take\nback everything that belongs to me.\nDon't tell me things like that old man\nwanted to protect me. It's all lies. He\nwatched as that bastard second brother\nturned me into a neither man\nnor woman, and was driven out of the\nkingdom without a single word of\nconcern. Do you know how cold the wind\nis? Is it the J border? They brought all\nof this upon themselves. As he spoke, he\nrevealed his vampire fangs. Kowong,\nyou'll always be loyal to me, right?\nFacing the pressure from the prince, he\nimmediately knelt down. This subordinate\nunderstands. I pledge my unwavering\nloyalty to your highness. As for the\nprince, he had now gone to meet the\nPope. Seeing his state, the Pope was\nequally surprised. Your highness, the\nfirst prince, I truly never expected\nthat you, the one always considered a\ngood for nothing, would be able to stand\nbefore me. Not only that, but you've\nalso brought me such a big surprise. The\nfirst prince looked at him angrily.\nYou're just a mere servant who relies on\nthe pity of the gods. What did you\npossibly know? After speaking, he used\nhis hellfire to attack the pope\ndirectly. Sib on the side watched with\ndelight. His two maids immediately\nstarted discussing. Master, they've\nstarted fighting. This is so exciting.\nThe first prince of the Koligan Empire\nis a vampire. Who will win in the end?\nThe Pope's men immediately mounted their\nrocks and charged out. Destroy those who\ndare to blaspheme the gods. The battle\nbetween the two sides became extremely\ntense. They looked at the undead\nangrily. Get your hands off me, you\nunclean things. But in a moment of\ncarelessness, he was bitten directly in\nthe neck by the first prince's bats. His\nbody quickly turned into a dried husk\nand his blood was absorbed by the\nundead. The first prince now stood in\nthe rain of blood, insatiably craving\nfresh blood energy. I will only become\nstronger and stronger. These petty\ntricks are fundamentally useless against\nme. Old man, where is your god descent\nart? Why don't you use it? The pope\nlooked at him angrily. You will soon see\nmy master descend upon this world. But\nafter waiting for a long time without a\nresponse from Yeihow, the old man became\nanxious. Where is that guy? Why hasn't\nhe come out yet? But after waiting a\nwhile longer, there was still no\nresponse. The Pope immediately felt\nconfused. I can't believe I was tricked.\nIf I ever see the Yeihow again, I will\ndefinitely throw him in a pit of fire.\nNo matter what, he had a stall for time.\nWhile he was thinking, Anna came out\nfrom inside. She looked ahead with an\nexpression full confidence. I feel the\ngod summons. The god likes this\natmosphere. I will be here to receive\nthe descent. Seeing her aura growing\nstronger and stronger, the pope finally\nfelt more at ease. The first prince also\nsensed that something was wrong and\nimmediately ordered his subordinate to\nadvance and stop her. Kong appeared\nbeside Anna as fast as a flash of\nlightning. But before he could do\nanything, his entire body was engulfed\nby flames. Seeing the pope dare to fight\nback like that, the first prince was\nfurious. You rotten old man. Don't you\nwant to live anymore? But the Pope\ndidn't look at him and instead laughed\nlike a madman. This power, she has\nawakened. The great flame dragon, the\ngod of war and red flame, has finally\ndescended. But before he could rejoice\nfor long, Anna's spear tip suddenly\npierced through his heart. His entire\nbody froze stiff at her betrayal. Anna\nlooked at him and shook her head. Bada,\na thief who dares to call himself war.\nAt this moment, an undead was still\nwandering around. Sibbon looked at it\ngrumpily. I can't stand it. Just how\nmany undead did that idiot create? I\ntake a moment to go out and relieve\nmyself. And I still run into one. While\nhe was still thinking, a body suddenly\nflew past him. It was the prince and the\npope pinned tightly to the wall. Seeing\nthem, he wondered, \"Why did the two of\nthem commit suicide together in a field\nlike this? I was only gone for a moment.\nDid I miss some important plot point?\nThere isn't a third party on this\nbattlefield. So, who on earth took them\nboth out?\" Well, he turned his head to\nlook in that direction. He was surprised\nto see Anna. He never expected to meet\nher in this situation, but her state now\nwas no longer the same as before. The\nfirst prince also saw Sibbon's\nappearance and was astonished. Eagle\nCrest Lord, why are you here? Weren't\nyou injured? Sibon appeared in front of\nhim. Even though I was seriously injured\nand my soldiers were reduced to less\nthan a tenth, unable to participate in\nthe battle as a subordinate, I was still\nvery worried about the first prince. So,\nI took it upon myself to come in here to\nsee if I could be of any help. Hearing\nthis, he opened his mouth wide. If you\nwant to focus, then I'll give you a\nchance to become my blood slave. Sib\nwasn't stupid enough to do as he said.\nHe glanced at Anna for a moment, then he\nthought away, dodged past the first\nprince's body, and threw him straight\ntowards the tip of Anna's spear. Her\npowerful spear quickly pierced through\nhis shoulder. Sibbon continued to play\ndumb. First prince, are you all right?\nIt's all my fault for not noticing the\ndanger sooner. If only the first prince\nwith the wound on his body was no longer\nin the mood to suck Sib's blood. The two\nof them quickly separated to dodge the\nfierce attacks coming from Anna. It\nseemed that after using her body as a\nvessel for a deity, Anna's attacks were\nmore ferocious than before. Facing the\ntip of her spear, the first prince still\nheld onto a sliver of hope. As long as\nthe soul gathering formations sacrifice\nabsorbed enough soul energy, he could\nsummon a legendary level ghost dragon to\nhelp, even if it meant temporarily\ndelaying the mount of the undead great\nemperor. Sibban looked at him and\nwondered, \"Does that guy still have a\nway to turn the tables?\" The first\nprince paid him no mind, but looked\ntowards his pendant. Luckily, I set up\nthe soul gathering formation beforehand.\nJust by using the summoning stone, I can\nactivate the sacrifice of the souls of\nseveral hundred thousand soldiers.\nEnough to hold back the full power of\nthis ghost dragon. It's almost time. My\nfinal trump card is finally about to be\nplayed. Power surged more and more\nwithin his body. Just as everything was\nsuccessfully prepared to summon an evil\ndragon, his formation unexpectedly\nshrank pitfully. Sibbon walked over to\ninquire, \"Your Highness, First Prince,\nwhy is the formation so small?\" This\nmade him embarrassed. Highle undead can\ntransform in a soul form. So an overly\nlarge formation is meaningless. As he\nspoke, a soul appeared within that\nformation. Seeing the light grow larger\nand larger, the first prince was\noverjoyed. Look closely. This is But\nbefore he could finish his sentence, he\nfell silent. The first prince was\nabashed. Excuse me, are you the undead\nspirit? The summoned entity pointed\nstraight at him and announced, \"You\nidiot. The soul gathering formation has\nbeen sabotaged by someone else. All the\ngathered souls have dissipated. What are\nyou summoning me for? Hearing that the\nfirst prince was confused. What? My\nformation has been destroyed. Seeing his\nhighness so troubled, Sibon stepped\nforward to ask your highness, where is\nthe soul gathering circle? Why don't I,\nyour subordinate, go and see if there's\na problem or not? And after learning\nthat the formation was at the\neasternmost wall, he was stunned because\nwasn't that the place he had destroyed a\nfew days ago? Remembering this, he\nimmediately scratched his head. I'm\ntruly sorry, your highness. When I went\nto relieve myself, I was attacked by an\nundead. While defending myself, I\naccidentally smashed the soul gathering\ncircle. The tiny ghost dragon was also\nat a loss. All right, then. I'm leaving.\nWhat can I do with a tiny body like\nthis? As soon as it finished speaking,\nit was the first to flee. Seeing all the\neffort he had prepared completely\nvanish. The first prince was furious. So\nhe immediately looked at Sibbon, lord of\nEagle Crest. All of this is because of\nyou. After speaking, he turned his head\nto look for his second subordinate,\nGeneral Kalin. Are you still conscious?\nHe immediately jumped up, thinking the\nsituation was unfavorable and wanting to\nretreat from this place. But that\nfoolish prince didn't want to and was so\nsenseless that he let a spear appear\nbehind his back. Kalin saw that and\nimmediately used his body to block the\nattack for him. That guy didn't even\nshed a single tear and turn into a gust\nof wind, disappearing right before\nSibbon's face. He didn't bother with\nthat useless guy and looked towards\nAnna. However, compared to that foolish\nfirst prince, this one is clearly much\nmore troublesome. Is this a demihuman\nafter becoming a vessel? No. To be\nprecise, she is no longer Anna, but the\ngod of war who has awakened by borrowing\nher body. At this moment, an old man\nappeared in front of Anna, wanting to\nsacrifice himself to summon a flame\ndragon. Banantheasa inside Anna's body,\nsaw this, and immediately became anxious\nbecause if the flame dragon appeared,\nthings would become even more\ntroublesome. But it was too late to stop\nit. That guy had already completed the\nsacrificial ritual, causing a fierce\nflame to appear in the sky. Vantheasa\nsaw this and not wanting backed to\nappear rushed forward to attack. But it\nwas all in vain. He couldn't touch the\nother guy's body. It seems the magic\nshield truly held back Bantheasa. He\npaid no mind and immediately sucked all\nthe flames from the air into his body.\nAfter that, a laugh echoed in the air,\nmaking it hard for us to hear much.\nSibbon sensed the situation was getting\nmore and more unstable and moved away\nfrom the area. From within the great\nflame, a spatial rift appeared and the\nflame dragon stepped out into this world\nand it greeted the world with a ball of\nfire element synthesized within its\nbody. His dragon's breath after being\nspewed out was like a stream of molten\nlava that melted the ground. Cibben had\nnow returned to the side of his two\nmaids. After that, he quickly led the\ntwo of them away from this place to\navoid getting caught in the crossfire.\nBut he didn't forget to look at the evil\ndragon that was relentlessly destroying\nthe surrounding scenery. According to\nthe systems assessment, its level is\naround 94. Not only that, it also opened\nits mouth and spoke in a human tongue.\nFinally, I can appear here, albeit\ntemporarily. Right now, I need a body\nthat can withstand my power.\nAccompanying his words were flames that\nconstantly erupted, melting the\nsurrounding space. Banthesa looked over\nthere and frowned. This power. But this\nwas also the moment the flame dragon\nfound his position and prepared to\nattack. While dodging the attack,\nBanthesa pondered, \"I have just\nawakened. My divine power is weak. I'm\nno match for this fire dragon.\"\nLogically, I should now be looking for\nartifacts that can contain the divinity\nof war to restore my power. But right\nafter awakening, I had to encounter this\nguy. So this awakening is a complete\nconspiracy. This fire dragon wants to\nchange the pillar. A cuckoo occupying a\nmagpie's nest, seizing my foundation.\nBut as the god of war, how could he let\nthis happen? He immediately summoned his\nsoldiers from the underworld to fight\nback. Banthas's power exploded, catching\nthe flame dragon offguard and causing it\nto lose a chunk of its body. It looked\nat the god of wars weapon. That spear is\na divine artifact. It now became anxious\nto think it tore a piece of my divinity.\nIt seems I must win this fight quickly.\nNow the exchange of attacks between the\ntwo of them was like a never-ending\nbattle. While dodging, Bantheasa felt\nregret because he was just a little\nshort earlier. If he could have pierced\nthe dragon's body just now, destroying\nit wouldn't have been difficult at all.\nSummoning a divine artifact takes time.\nIf this continues, I will be drained by\nthis impostor. I must think of a way to\nstop its attacks. But while fighting,\nBantheasa suddenly sensed three special\npeople. He quickly looked in that\ndirection. Who is over there? I didn't\nexpect such a high-grade energy to be\nhere. If it's that thing, I won't lose\nto that dragon. After saying that, he\nimmediately rushed straight in that\ndirection. Seeing this, Sibbon smiled. I\nwas originally planning to wait for\nthose two idiots to wear each other out\nbefore making a move. I didn't expect\nboth of them to force me to reveal my\nextraordinary identity. So he used the\nhow angel delay card. This was also the\nmoment ban phase's claws were getting\ncloser and closer to his face. But from\nwithin the dark sky, a ray of light\nappeared, rushing straight towards\nSibbon's body. A pair of beautiful wings\nappeared to Banthesa's surprise. A\nconfident smile appeared on the corner\nof Sibbon's mouth with a beautiful pure\nwhite suit of armor. What's this about?\nHow angel descending? I waited half a\nday and it turns out it's just myself.\nIs this the control the system was\ntalking about? It's so forced. Then he\nsmiled, looked at Lori, and shook his\nhead. Don't be scared. It's me. After\nspeaking, he even patted her head. But\nhe didn't know when Ruer had also\nappeared behind him, licking his neck.\nBut at this moment, he began to feel\nthat something was not right because the\ncondition of those two girls was\ncompletely different from normal. After\nchecking, he found out that it was due\nto the ability of the how angel. If the\nduration of the transformation ability\nwasn't so short, he would have wanted to\nuse this power to play around a bit. But\nnow was not the time for him to get\ncarried away like that because he still\nhad two opponents in front of him that\nhe hadn't dealt with. He now tightly\ngripped the lightning sword in his palm.\nThen he created a magic circle of light\nthat enveloped his body. Along with\nthis, a ray of light quickly shot\ntowards the sky, separating the two of\nthem from each other. Banthesa looked\nover with a pensive gaze. What is this?\nThat aura is it's just as I thought.\nThat human has the aura of the god of\nlight. But why did he appear here? While\nthey were still stunned, Sibbon suddenly\ncoughed up a mouthful of blood. Seeing\nthis, his maid became very worried.\nMaster Sibon showed a pained expression.\nThis power is too strong. I can't hold\non much longer. That sword is absorbing\nall the light around me. I can't even\nfind a way to hold it. System. What is\nthis situation? It quickly reminded him,\n\"The host's body cannot withstand the\npressure of the divine sword of\njudgment.\" Hearing that, Sibbon was\nangry. \"Why didn't you tell me something\nso important from the beginning? It's no\ngood. I can't control it anymore.\"\nBanthesa looked at him and smiled. \"I\nthought you were some powerful figure,\njust a mere mortal body fantasizing\nabout controlling divine power.\" Lorie\nwas now trying to use her recovery power\nto prevent her master from breaking\napart. The system announced at this\nmoment the host can purchase the\nblessing of the how angel requiring the\nconsumption of 100 million gold coins.\nLooking at the astronomical number, he\nreally wanted a curse, but had no other\nchoice. In the end, he could only use\nthe money he had to exchange for the\nblessing. So, this was the blessing of\nthe how angel. As expected, it was no\nlonger as strenuous as before. Thus, he\neasily used his power, creating a stream\nof golden sword chi that attacked the\nflame dragon directly and easily took\none of its arms. And after that, he\neasily absorbed the divinity of war.\nSeeing this, he was surprised. Was it\nbecause he had defeated Anna that he\nobtained the divinity on her? So, did I\njust defeat the newly awakened god of\nwar? To still be able to jump around\nafter being stabbed twice so powerfully,\nits health is truly immense. That dragon\nlooked at him. So it was you last time.\nIf she hadn't protected you, you would\nhave been burned to ashes. You are her\nperson, yet you don't know who she is.\nThat's right. Right now, she is merely\nclinging to her last breath. Perhaps\nonly a little instinct remains. Hearing\nthis, Sibbon's face became puzzled. Stop\nplaying hideand seek with me. Who is\nshe? Speak up. The flame dragon looked\nat him teasingly. Do you really want to\nknow who she is? But in reality, it only\nwanted to stall for time until his\ntransformation state disappeared. So, it\ncontinued to beat around the bush. All\nright, this story begins from a farway\ntale. Upon hearing this, Sibbon\nimmediately flared up and looked at it.\nEnough. You want to play a stalling game\nwith me? Then go to hell. I can\ncompletely feel that you don't want to\nanswer. Before being sent back to its\nworld, the flame dragon roared in anger.\nDamn it, I'll remember you. But he\ncouldn't be bothered and continued to\ncharge forward. Did you forget you said\nthe exact same thing last time? After\nthat, he flew to his two maids and held\nthem in his arms, using his own wings to\nshield them from the terrifying heat\nemitted by the flame dragon. After all,\nthis was the aftermath of a destroyed\ngod, so it was not to be taken lightly.\nAfterwards, he asked his maids if they\nwere okay. But seeing them so lively,\nthey seemed to be perfectly fine. Sibbon\nsaw that and smiled. It's good that\nyou're okay. It's almost over. Suddenly,\nhe remembered something. That's right.\nthe first prince. I almost forgot him.\nWe must pull out the weeds by the roots\nand not leave any future trouble. If it\nweren't for those two boring gods\ncausing chaos, I would have finished him\noff long ago, especially since he's\nalready heavily injured. Oh well, I'll\njust let Clement lead the soulless\nknights to eliminate him. Elsewhere, the\nfirst prince had a face of extreme\nanger. Damn it. As a vampire, as long as\nmy death energy isn't depleted, I can\nregenerate my body. I will definitely\nreturn. At that time, I want to drain\nthe blood of every single one of them.\nWhether it's those bastards from the\nchurch or the eagler crest lord who\nruined my great plan. Wait, what's\nhappening? Why is it snowing in this\nweather? A girl appeared behind him.\nIsn't weather like this beautiful?\nYou're just a petty vampire. Consider\nthis snowy scene as a farewell gift to\nsend you on your way. Gabriel, the holy\nmaiden of the Church of Light, looked at\nthe first prince and shook her head. Go\nin peace. After that, the intensity of\nthe snowfall grew, covering the entire\nspace here. Sibbon was also captivated\nby such a snowfall. Why is the weather\nso strange? Wait, this snow isn't cold\nat all. This isn't snow. Not only that,\nit also made him feel an immense\nfamiliarity. These snowflakes were\nfundamentally the purest holy light\nenergy. But why would this kind of\nenergy appear here? At this moment, he\nwas immediately drawn by the sounds of\nbattle created by Gabriel. Sibbon looked\nover in surprise. Clement and the\nsoulless knights. Why are they fighting\nsomeone here? Moreover, their opponent\nis. Isn't that the holy maiden of the\nChurch of Light? Gabriel. Clement faced\nthe woman before him, gripping the sword\nin his hand tightly. Gabriel, however,\nwas completely fearless, as if she were\non a stroll. Old Knight, you are clearly\na human. Why would you want to befriend\nthe undead? If that's the case, then\nreturn to the embrace of death. The\nlight does not welcome you. Sibbon stood\nto the side, looking at her, stunned.\nWhile fighting Clement, she had almost\nwiped out the soulless knights. They are\nboth holy maidens. But compared to the\nultimate weapon of the Church of Light,\nLewis is truly just a mascot. No wonder\nAnna was defeated. This has nothing to\ndo with strength, but rather the powers\nthey follow. Gabriel still hadn't\nnoticed his presence and continued to\nfight. Seeing the smile on Gabriel's\nlips, Sibbin realized his old knight was\nabout to be overwhelmed. If this\ncontinued, his entire troop of soulless\nknights would be cleaned up by her. With\nno other choice, he could only reveal\nhimself to stop this. Stop your hand at\nonce. It seemed his current appearance\ncaused Gabriel to quickly misunderstand.\nLord, how angel, I didn't expect there\nwould be someone here using the power\npassed down by the angels. Sibbon then\nlooked at Clement and ordered, \"You\nstand down for now.\" Gabriel now looked\nat him with a displeased expression. You\nwere chosen by the how angel. So why\nmust you befriend the undead? Sib while\ndodging didn't forget to reply because I\nwon them in a lottery. Why else? So he\nbrought out his powerful blades to\ndefend himself. Gabriel now felt\nextremely annoyed. The judgment angel is\nthe same as the throne angel. They hate\nthe undead the most. Saying this, the\ncorner of her mouth curled into a smile.\nEven though you know this, you still\nwant to stop me. Sib dodged while\npondering. This is so troublesome.\nAlthough I don't want a conflict with\nthe Church of Light, eliminating the\nundead is a matter of principle for\nthem. There's no way to communicate and\nresolve this peacefully with words\nanymore. In a moment of carelessness,\nGabriel created an opening for him to\nget close. Sib looked at her with a cold\ngaze. Enough. Stop. Leave immediately. I\nwon't mind sending you to meet the god\nof light. But he had underestimated her\npower. Even in a situation like this,\nshe still easily counterattacked. Sib\nretreated. Was my feeling wrong? That\nlast sword strike was clearly several\ntimes heavier, but he didn't know that\nGabriel was currently in the state of\nangelic descent. It seemed that in this\nstate, her power made things more\ndifficult for him. But theoretically\nspeaking, angelic descent is not the\nsame as a sacrifice. The highest ranking\narchangel is only a demigod. After the\ndescent, the user will be slightly\nweakened, which is much milder than a\ndivine descent. No wonder Gabriel always\nhas an indifferent look. It turns out\nshe is a trump card and is fundamentally\nnot afraid. Gabriel looked at him and\nsmiled. Well, since you were chosen as\nthe holy son of the holy sea, why would\nyou join hands with the undead? Hearing\nthat, even he was surprised. Chosen.\nWhat does that mean? Isn't this a reward\nfrom the system? And what's this about a\nholy son? Doesn't the church of light\nonly have a holy maiden? I don't know\nwhat a holy son does either. Could it be\nto have a bunch of little holy children\nwith a holy maiden? Holy moly, Eden. No,\nI've been too influenced by Lori lately.\nGet serious. The time for the divine\ndescent is now less than 2 minutes. I\ncould collapse at any moment. Gabriel\nsaw that he wasn't saying anything and\nfrowned. You don't want to talk, do you?\nSib was not paying any attention to her\nat this point, but was focusing\neverything on his sword. If that's the\ncase, I have no choice but to use this\nmove. The two maid saw his state and\nbecame worried. Even the old butler was\nno exception. Sibbon used his ultimate\nmove and knelt down. Your respected\nhighness, I have no hostility towards\nyou. Please allow me to explain about\nthese undead. These undead knights are\nall my subordinates. They were\nunfortunately killed in a campaign, then\nturned into undead knights by the first\nprince using a soul gathering formation.\nBut what I didn't expect was that even\nafter becoming undead, they continue to\nbe loyal to me and fight for me.\nGabriel, no matter how much I hate the\nundead, how could I be so heartless as\nto strike down such loyal servants? His\nheartfelt performance and words left\nGabriel stunned. Sibbon knew that this\nalone was not enough, so he signaled his\ntwo maids to help. They immediately\nstarted crying and telling their sad\nstory, making anyone who heard it feel\nheartbroken. But who would have thought\nthat at this critical moment by would\nappear and ruin the mood. I'm here. What\nare you guys doing? Sibbon knew he\ncouldn't let that girl speak nonsense\nand immediately glared at her. Cry for\nme or today will be your death\nanniversary. Gabriel looked at him and\nhis crying servants and surmised that he\nprobably wasn't lying. So she nodded. I\ncan sympathize with your heart that\ncherishes loyal retainers, but the\nundead still need to be eliminated. I am\nvery sorry for what happened. These\nwarriors deserve respect, but the\nexistence of the undead is unacceptable.\nAll right, then. If I consume my\noriginal divine power, I can turn them\ninto knights of light. Are you willing?\nBut even so, their souls cannot be\nrecovered. Hearing that, he immediately\nand joyfully accepted this gift that\nfell from the heavens. Of course, I'm\nwilling. This is also a salvation for\nthem. But won't it cause you to pay too\ngreat a price? Gabriel didn't say much\nmore and used her power to envelop the\nknights in light. No need to worry too\nmuch. Under her power, the undead were\nquickly enveloped in light. And so the\ntransformation process quickly took\nplace. They quickly shed their dark\ncloaks and then a dazzling light stunned\neveryone present. Sib looked at his\nknights and almost screamed because\ntheir new form was truly too cool along\nwith incredibly powerful stats. Although\nthey have no recovery skill, their\ndamage against the undead and demons has\nbeen greatly increased. Most\nimportantly, I can now display this\ngreat power openly and honorably without\nhaving to hide it. At this very moment,\nhis transformation ability also\ndisappeared, after which he looked\ntowards the holy maiden. He immediately\nknelt down before her. I am truly\ngrateful for your help today. If there's\nan opportunity next time, I hope that I\ncan be of some assistance to the Holy\nMaiden. Gabriel looked at him\nscrutinizingly. In the end, you must\nremember to use the power of light\ncarefully and not do evil deeds. He said\nit so coolly, but in reality, that girl\nimmediately fainted into his arms after\nher transformation ended. The problem he\nhad to worry about now was what to do\nwith this holy maiden girl. Although she\nhad lost a lot of power, it seemed\nGabriel still had her own consciousness.\nSib felt that this was the perfect\nopportunity. He immediately used a\ndivine rope to tie her body up, and what\nfollowed was a scene of brutal physical\ntorture for the holy maiden. Without a\nword, he applied force with his hands,\nweighing down on her buttocks. Because\nshe had no strength left to resist, she\ncould only accept her bitter end. Not\nonly that, she was also humiliatingly\nhung up by him. After finishing\ntormenting her, he led his servants and\nleft. Anyway, she had a protective\ntalisman on her so she wouldn't die that\neasily. The problem he needed to deal\nwith now was to prepare for the next\nbox. However, the treasure he was trying\nto find had already been discovered by\nBao. She gave a bewitching smile as she\nlooked at him, which was very uh\nannoying. Seeing her teasing face, he\ngot angry and gave her a beating. After\ndealing with her, he was also led to the\nlocation of the treasure inside the\nroyal palace. He was imagining the scene\nof himself obtaining lots of gold,\nsilver, jewels, and treasures here. And\nwhen he opened the door to the royal\npalace's treasury, what Sibbon witnessed\nimmediately stunned him. Why is this not\nlike what I imagined? Isn't it supposed\nto be treasures and gold everywhere?\nThis place is so different from what I\nthought. The equipment hanging on wooden\nposts was nothing rare. The treasure in\nthis whole room was only five or six\nchests of gold and silver. A branch of\nthe world tree, a gem from a scepter,\nand a hero grade sword. This innermost\nroom actually only contained four\nthings. The branch of the world tree,\nand the gem from the scepter of nature\nwere typical, extremely precious magical\nitems. It seems that despite the old\nking's turmoil, there were still some\nrare items. He immediately gave those\ntwo items to Lori with instructions to\ntake them to Winterfrost City to see if\nthe divinity within them could be\nextracted. As for the herogra sword he\nfound, although it wasn't a great sword,\nit didn't feel bad. It had conquest and\nan intelligent presence within. I could\nbe considered strong enough now. But at\nthis moment, an old man suddenly entered\nto report to him. He announced, \"Lord,\nwe have rescued the old duke from\nprison.\" In addition, there are a few\nnobles who have not yet surrendered.\nCurrently, the king still has one\nprince, three princesses, and the queen\nalive. They are demanding the return of\nroyal power. How should we deal with\nthese people? Sib smiled upon hearing\nthis. For those who don't know what's\ngood for them, how else should we deal\nwith them? Behead the prince and display\nhis head throughout the country. The\nothers will suffer the same fate. Then\nhe looked towards the butler. Clement\nremember to arrange for people to bring\nthese things back to Winter Frost City.\nCompared to the center, Dragonfire City,\nEagle Crest territory in the center of\nthe northern continent is the forefront\nin the fight against demonic beasts.\nMoreover, at this stage, I cannot rest\nassured leaving Winterfrost City to be\nmanaged by demihumans. So, choosing that\nplace as the capital is more\nappropriate. While he was discussing\nmatters, a voice suddenly rang out from\noutside, attracting his attention. The\nsecond prince with an angry face looked\nat him. I'm telling you, Lord of Eagle\nCrest, don't think you can sit back and\nenjoy this country. My older brother\nHitler is on his way here. He might have\nalready reached Drag on Fire City by\nnow. Before he could finish speaking,\nanother person appeared reporting, \"My\nlord, a mile outside the city, an army\nhas arrived with ill intentions. Their\nmilitary strength is estimated at\n20,000.\" At this time, Sibbon's father\nappeared. My good son, I finally waited\nfor you. Initially, I just wanted to\nstand among the ranks of the nobility,\nbut I was unexpectedly plotted against\nby the pope. Furthermore, that Hitler,\nin order to bewitch the pope, even\npoison me and handed me over to the Pope\nas a hostage. How could that bastard\ntreat me like this? He wouldn't even\nspare a little money. Son, teach him a\nlesson. His two maids looked at the\naffectionate scene between the father\nand son, bewildered because they looked\nnothing alike. Sib smiled at his father.\nAre you really okay? Big brother is on\nhis way here with his army, but he\ndidn't seem to care what I say I do. No\nneed for any more fuss. Speaking of\nwhich, I still have to thank this eldest\nson of mine. If he hadn't run off, I\nstill wouldn't know how many tumors were\nunder my command. At this time, outside\nthe kingdom, Hitler finally arrived. He\ndidn't expect the magnificent drag-on\nfire city to be almost destroyed and the\nbattle to have been so fierce. It's a\npity my younger brother died so early\notherwise I would have liked to see his\nsurprised face today I Hitler will take\nback this country. Terrence take your\nscouts inside to investigate the\nsituation. Hearing that she nodded as\nyou command master. And so they\nimmediately infiltrated the city of drag\non fire. After a while they returned my\nlord there's still some of the pope's\ntroops in the city but they are\nexhausted. It seems this battle was won\nbut it was a pirick victory. Hitler\nsmiled upon hearing that. Not bad. So,\nhow many troops does the pope have left\nunder his command? But at this moment, a\nsubordinate looked at him and warned,\n\"My lord, I think attacking Draon Fire\nCity now is a bit hasty. After all, the\naccuracy of the second prince's\ninformation cannot be determined right\nnow. No one has come out to meet us. I'm\nafraid there might be an ambush.\"\nTerrence looked at him mockingly. \"Sir\nRobert, are you doubting my scouting\nability?\" He looked at her. I don't\ndoubt that ability. It's just that I\nfeel someone who relies on selling their\nbeauty to get information fundamentally\ndoesn't understand that real combat and\nscouting are completely different. We\nneed to consider many other factors.\nSeeing that they were about to argue,\nHitler spoke up. All right, all actions\nthis time will be according to Terrence.\nAnyway, just standing here will only\nmake us miss the opportunity. Robert\nattack Draon Fire City. Having no other\nchoice, he could only lead his army and\ncharge forward. Meanwhile, Hitler looked\nat that girl with affection. Don't mind\nhim. Even though his strength is\nformidable, he's still a rigid person.\nTerrence looked at him and cast her\nenchanting spell. Hitler almost fell for\nit completely. I just don't know if\nRobert can successfully defeat the\nPope's rebel army. You must know that\nthe Pope's strength is at an invincible\nlevel. Terrence appeared extremely\nconfident at this moment. Rest assured,\nmy lord, even if Robert can't defeat the\nrebel army. It has nothing to do with\nme. After saying that, she immediately\nsent Hitler on his way to heaven. With\nan extremely triumphant voice, \"In any\ncase, you are going to die here, my\nlord.\" As she spoke, her blade plunged\ndeeper and deeper inside, causing\nHitler's wound to hemorrhage. But as a\nman in power, he still had some strength\nto fight back. Well, only now do we\nlearn that Terrence was actually an\nimpostor. You tried to assassinate me,\nbut I managed to escape, right? Seeing\nthat familiar face, Hitler seeed with\nhatred the human Aaron up. I clearly\nwitnessed your death. Aaron looked at\nhim and smiled. So, young master Hitler\nwas also deceived by anger. Then why did\nbetraying and deceiving the old Duke\nseems so natural? You easily passed on\nthe order that Aaron had died in\nexchange for Terren's intelligence when\nyou had just taken over Golden Lion\nCity. The staff was in chaos. You didn't\narrange for guards to secure the\nterritory. Instead, you were always\nthinking of illicit matters, making it\neasy for me to infiltrate. Hitler looked\nat him. Are the remaining soldiers in\nKnights yours? If all of this was\nplanned, Robert and the others who\nentered the city have likely met with\nmisfortune. Surrendering won't even get\nme. My father's corpse. Not to mention\nthat bastard Sibbon is surely aiming for\nmy life already. I must quickly find an\nopening and seize the chance to escape.\nBut before he could do anything, Sibbin\nand his father appeared. His father\nlooked at Hitler and shook his head. As\nthe eldest son of the Golden Lion\nfamily, inheriting the richest\nterritory, why didn't you calmly learn\nto rule the land, but instead were\nalways greedy and causing trouble\neverywhere? Clearly, no one was\ncompeting with you. Even Sibbon has\nnever had such thoughts, choosing to\ntake on the border territory by himself.\nI always turned a blind eye to you, but\nyou have disappointed me too much. For a\nbeast like you with no family affection\nor childhood out of consideration for\nour father-son relationship, I will not\ndestroy you here. I will only\nyour battle chi and give you a piece of\nland to fend for yourself. Hitler looked\non in shock. Father, I am your son. You\ncan't my battle chi. I am a sky\nknight, but in his heart, he was full of\ncalculations. To escape from this\nsituation today, I can only take a\nhostage. Father is the easiest target,\nbut those two are beside him. What\nshould I do? Or perhaps that girl over\nthere is more important in Sib's heart.\nI'll attack the young woman first to\nlure him out, then kidnap the smaller\ngirl. That's the only way I'll have a\nhope of escaping. They're just two weak\nchickens. As long as they're not\nvigilant, the advantage will be on my\nside. Seeing his actions, their group\nimmediately became vigilant. Rule looked\nat the direction of his movement and\nimmediately guessed that his target was\nher. Hitler still didn't know the danger\nthat was approaching and remained very\nfocused. His face filled with\nindignation. If you want to blame\nsomeone, blame the lecher who brings\nwomen to the battlefield. However, his\nattack couldn't touch Ruer at all. Not\nonly that, but she also used her speed\nto get behind him and was mercilessly\nbeheaded by her strike. His father,\nsitting above, looked down at the fate\nof his son without saying a word. Sib\nlooked towards him and spoke, \"I'm\nsorry, father.\" But he was also very\nunderstanding. This is not a matter for\nwhich you should apologize for this\nunrepentant brat. It is all his own\ndoing, especially for our Golden Lion\nfamily. Keeping him would be an endless\ndisaster. At this time, Knight quickly\nenveloped the place. Sibbon looked at\nhis system panel and smiled. The older\nthe ginger, the spicier it gets. It\nwould be strange if he didn't know I\nintended to user the throne. Where is my\nsecond plot reward system? Receiving his\nprompt, it quickly appeared. Level three\nbarracks redemption card reward has been\ndetected. Genie level system, please do\nnot disturb. If urgent, please figure\nout yourself. Seeing this, he quickly\nopen the card. The system is getting\nmore and more complicated. After\nupgrading, do I still need to search\nmanually? A notification popped up.\nExchange requires no villain points nor\nany prerequisites, just designated\ndirectly. There are some notable options\nsuch as Wyvern's Lair, Watchtower,\nPlague Tomb, Catfish Bridge, Ice Statue,\nVolcano Crater. With so many, he\nwondered which one to choose. Sib\npondered after ascending the throne. I\nmust establish an army. The Google\nRegiment has been wiped out. Right now,\nthe priority is an air force. So, he\nquickly chose the Wyverns Lair. To put\nit simply, this is a base for creating\ndragons that fight in the air. At the\nsame time, the system also successfully\nupgraded. Sib was also walking around\nlooking for a place to put down his\nstructure. Bubble looked at him and\nsmiled. When did you get back, sir? I\ndidn't see you. Oh, right. There's\nsomething Bubble wants to inform you\nabout. Bubble wants to ask you to find\nsome strange objects like those statues\nfrom last time. I want to enter the\nsecond awakening stage a little sooner.\nDidn't you say that as long as there are\nenough materials, Big Stone Head can be\nrevived? the second adolescent stage can\nalso permanently transform me to have\ntwo legs. At that time, I want to go\nfind the materials for revival. Hearing\nher say that, he was very surprised. He\noriginally thought Bubble had long\nforgotten about this, but he didn't\nexpect her to still remember it so\nclearly. It seems she valued Big Stone\nHead a lot. But at this moment, he also\nreminded her, \"It's just that divine\nitems are not easy to find. Perhaps by\nthe time we find enough divine items,\nthe materials to revive Sakin might have\nalready been collected. Hearing that,\nBubble was also stunned. Does that mean\nhe can be revived sooner? Siba nodded.\nThat's right. But don't worry. Once I\ndiscover any oceanic divine items, I\nwill tell you. Hearing that, the little\ngirl's eyes lit up. You think it would\nstart a different story, but it went\nback to the story from 2 hours ago.\nKnowing that if he continued to talk\nlike this, it would drag on and on, he\nimmediately gave a perfuncter reply and\nleft. But Bubbles still called for him\nto wait a moment. It turned out that\nthis time she wanted to give him an\namulet she had just created. Hearing\nthat, Sibbon smiled. An amulet, right?\nAlthough it has been abandoned, Bubble\nis still the one who maintains the\nrituals of the Crystal Palace. An amulet\nshe personally made might be extremely\neffective. But before he could finish\nspeaking, the shape of the amulet was\nrather strange. Seeing its shape, he\ncouldn't help but associate it with\nSarakan. Afterwards, he also found a\nsuitable location to place the new\nbarracks. Inside the mountain, a dragon\nquickly appeared with its eggs. It\nimmediately let out its first call to\nshow its might. Looking at that form,\nSibbon was surprised. Compared to the\nnearby Crusader recruitment investment,\nthe Wyvern's architectural style is also\nquite crude and doesn't fit with the\nsurroundings. After saying that, he\nimmediately rushed straight to the top\nof the mountain and quickly called for\nthat dragon to wake up, but it\ncompletely ignored him. It seems the old\nwyvern is a part of the layer and won't\nobey my commands. I should first\nexchange for a wyvern to see. So he\nquickly went to meet the city guards and\nrequested them to inform Good by to have\nsomeone bring a ton of beast meat here.\nSo after a period of time, enough was\ncollected. Seeing this, he was\ndelighted. Next is this level three\nmagic beast crystal core. Old wyvern, I\nwant to recruit a poison wyvern. Hearing\nthis, the dragon immediately rushed up\nand ate all the meat. With just its\nmouth, it quickly swallowed the pile of\nmeat hole. After eating, it quickly\nreturned to its lair. Then it lay down\non top and took a nap. And just like\nthat, a large dragon egg appeared.\nSeeing this, Sibbon was extremely\nsurprised. I didn't think a wyvern could\nactually return to its nest, incubate an\negg, and produce a soldier. After a\nperiod of less than 5 minutes, the egg\nfinally hatched. The large dragon\nquickly pushed the newly born wyvern\ndown below. It seemed to be very scared.\nSibbon was the same, falling from such a\nheight, unless the newborn little dragon\nhad the ability to fly, but completely\ndifferent for what he thought, it\nimmediately crashed straight into the\nground. This even caused its health\nlevel to drop by more than half. Sibon\nobserved for a moment, then showed his\ndelight. It's already level 38 just\nafter being born. Three more levels, and\nit can enter the fourth tier, equivalent\nto a human earth knight. Not bad. Once\nmass-produced, they can become an elite\narmy. Most importantly, it has both\nphysical damage and poison elemental\ndamage. He quickly stepped forward and\npatted its head. Do you understand my\nwords? Very good. Now, can you carry me\nfor a flight? It immediately understood\nand flapped its wings, carrying him off\nthe ground. The advantages are fast\nspeed and great strength. It can be used\nas a mount and for attacking. The\nsoldiers produced by the system don't\nneed to be tamed. As long as they are\nrecruited, they will be very obedient.\nBut there's also a problem. not big, not\nsmall. It's that the wyvern doesn't have\na single hair on its body. It's all\nhide. Without using battle aura for\nprotection, the dragon riders will\nbecome bareass riders. It seems that in\nthe future, when establishing the Wyvern\nKnight core, whether for players or\nsoldiers, a dragon saddle will need to\nbe made for use. While flying in the\nsky, he suddenly looked down below and\nsaw his maid doing something unknown\nlate at night. After all, she is still a\nsaintist of the demihumans. I'm afraid\nthere's something she needs to do. Wait\na minute. She's gone so quickly. Poison\nWyvern, let's go back. Seeing him leave,\nRuer quickly went to meet a mysterious\nperson. Is it okay now? He's gone. As\nfor Sibbon, he quickly jumped down.\nLorie saw him and smiled. Master, you're\nhere. Is that Master's new mount? Then\nshe quickly took out the thing she had\nprepared and gave him to him to eat.\nSibbon tasted it and felt very satisfied\nwith the flavor it brought. Hearing\nthat, Lorie told him a story. In the\npast, when fleeing from place to place,\ndemihumans all like to pick this fruit\nto eat. It's not only sweet and\nrefreshing, but can also satisfy hunger.\nNow, thanks to master, we also have a\ndecent place to live. And she quickly\npulled him onto a sofa and massaged and\ncuped him. Master, are you about to\nbecome king? Sib replied, the empire has\nbeen overthrown. Even if it's for you\nand the demihumans, I will also bear\nthis responsibility. Lorie was stunned\nwhen she heard that. Master, I heard\nthat kings don't have demihuman\nservants. Hearing the worry in her\nwords, he burst out laughing. I thought\nyou were worried about something else.\nDon't worry, a king is an existence that\ncan set the rules. If I establish a\nroyal maid core exclusively for me, no\none would dare to have an opinion. After\nsaying that, he immediately pulled his\nmaid into his arms. I'll ask you if I\nbecome king, would you also want to\nbecome my queen? Hearing this, she\nhesitated. Master this, Lorie was\nafraid. She couldn't bear the\nresponsibility of a queen. Compared to\nthe many citizens, Lorie actually only\ncares about her master. I just want to\nbe master's little girl. That would make\nme very content. Hearing her say that,\nSibbon smiled. So, that's how it is.\nLori has thought it through, too. All\nright, it's fine if you don't want to be\nqueen. It's settled then. Having you is\nenough for me. I don't need a queen. But\nat this moment, a wave of energy\nsuddenly spread through his body. Seeing\nhim freeze, Lorie asked with concern,\n\"What's wrong, master?\" He stammered. I\nsuddenly feel dizzy and so sleepy. I\ndon't know what's happening. I feel like\nmy whole body has lost all its strength.\nAs he said this, he also looked at\nsomething. Oh, right. I ate that whole\nplate of Starfall fruit. Lori, we didn't\nremove the toxins, did you? Hearing\nthis, her whole body began to glow.\nAfter all, it's something Master eats.\nSo, of course, Lorie has to handle it\nwell. Therefore, intentionally leaving a\nlittle bit of toxin was also on purpose.\nSeeing her current appearance, his nose\nquickly started bleeding. Lori didn't\ncare at all and immediately pounced on\nhim. Master, do you know that when you\nfound Lori, according to demihuman age,\nI was only 16. After awakening once, I\nwas 17 and today is my 18th birthday. So\ntoday, I want a special gift. Although\nmaster doesn't want to hurt me, Lori is\nnot afraid. Now that I'm an adult, I'll\ncome and get this gift myself. It's\nunknown how passionate it was inside,\nbut outside, Ruer seemed to be deep in\nthought. In her hand, she held a\nmysterious medallion, its purpose\nunknown. The next morning, Chris looked\nat him and complained, \"Lord, really,\nshe's still young.\" Even though she was\nproactive, you should have been gentler.\nNo matter what, you can't make it, so\nshe can't even eat breakfast. Young\npeople these days being told off like\nthat. He also felt embarrassed and\nquickly changed the subject. Oh, right.\nHave you seen Rui? Chris shook her head,\nsaying she hadn't seen her since\nyesterday, which surprised him. Thinking\nof Rua's mysterious appearance last\nnight, he wondered in his heart, could\nit be that from the time I saw her on\nthe road yesterday until now, she still\nhasn't come back? While he was\npondering, he suddenly looked at Chris,\nstunned, then inquired, \"Mrs. Chris,\nthis bracelet of yours is truly\nspecial.\" Hearing this, she smiled,\n\"Thank you for the compliment, young\nmaster. This was a gift from my 21st\nhusband when he proposed to me. Although\nit's been a long time, its design is\nstill as unique as the day I got it.\nHearing this, Sib felt something was a\nbit off, hoping he wouldn't become her\nex-lover. At this point, Mrs. Chris\nlooked at him. That's right, young\nmaster. Later, have Lorie take your\nphysical measurements. Recently, the\ncraftsmen have been working overtime to\ncreate the attire and scepter for the\ncoronation ceremony. I believe it won't\nbe long before we should be calling you\nyour majesty. It's truly exciting. After\nhe was left alone, he looked at the\nsystem panel, thinking of a way to\nresurrect Sarakin. At this moment, a\nscreen of light appeared, showing him\nthe necessary information. Although\nSarakan had sacrificed himself, his soul\nwas still preserved, and this was also\nthe important material for resurrection.\nWhile he was thinking, Clemen had also\nreturned. Hearing that, he immediately\nassigned in the task of collecting\nmaterials. The first thing I need you to\ndo is arrange for spies to go to\ndifferent nations to gather information\nabout pure tribute artifacts. As soon as\nyou have any, record it. The second\nthing is I need a dwarf. Hearing this,\nhe was immediately surprised. My lord,\ndwarves haven't appeared in the north\nfor hundreds of years. If we go to the\nsouthern nations, we'll have to cross\nthe vast orc empire and even clash with\ndemons. Hearing this, he pondered, \"All\nright, then just help me gather news\nabout the dwarfs first. Where are they\nhiding now? And where have they\nappeared? Also, help me purchase a batch\nof soul essence steel. For now, there's\nnothing else. Help me call Allan. Over.\nAfterwards, just as instructed, he was\nalso summoned. Seeing that he had\narrived, Sibbon smiled. This is to thank\nyou for disguising yourself as a woman\nto get close to Hitler. Otherwise, I\nwouldn't know how many more times my\nbrother would have used the Pope's name\nto try and eliminate me. Hearing this,\nAllen's face turned completely red.\nDon't mention it again. Now, my habits\nof flirting and posing have been found\nout by others, and there are even\nstrange rumors. I really want to get out\nof here. Sib also gave an awkward smile.\nAll right, then you can go out for a\nwalk, and while you're at it, help me\nwith something. I want you to help me\ndeliver this letter. The address is on\nit. The place is a bit far. I hope you\ncan return in time to attend my\ncoronation ceremony. Receiving the\nmission, he immediately puffed out his\nchest and agreed, promising that he\nwould succeed. But at this moment,\nanother girl entered from outside. My\nlord, may I ask if you are free right\nnow? Mrs. Chris told me to come and take\nyour body measurements. Seeing the\nhotness of the girl in front of them,\nboth of them immediately froze. Seeing\nthat they said nothing, she spoke up. My\nlord, is something wrong? It's almost\ntime to take your body measurements. Are\nyou still working? Knowing that it\nwouldn't be good for him to be here,\nAllan quickly left. After he left, she\nrevealed a bewitching smile. Sibbon\nlooked her all over and inquired, \"Are\nyou a new maid? Why haven't I seen you\nbefore?\" She nodded. Yes, my lord. My\nname is Vivien, a new maid. Please stand\nup for a moment. The master is about to\nbecome a king, so it's only natural to\nhave one more person to take care of\nhim. Let me help the future king measure\nhis body. Feeling the fragrance on her\nbody, Sibbon didn't let his guard down\nall. But the more time passed, the more\nhe felt something strange. Why do I\nalways feel that this fragrance makes me\ndizzy? Viven saw his condition and\nsmiled. Then she quickly pressed herself\nagainst his body. Your Majesty, your\nback is so broad. Then she used her own\nweight to push him down onto the table\nand continuously made suggestive moves\ntowards him. Along with that was a\nboneless tongue wrapping around his\nentire body along with extremely\nskillful crawling movements. Seeing that\nhis body didn't move, her eyes became\nincreasingly sharp. Just as Sib was\nabout to enjoy this worldly delicacy,\nLori appeared here, whether by accident\nor on purpose. Master, are you thirsty?\nI brought you a drink. As she said this,\nher face froze. Then feeling extremely\ndisappointed, she left the place. Sib\nimmediately regained his senses and\npushed Vivien away. What are you doing?\nWeren't you supposed to be taking my\nbody measurements? Why is it turned into\nthis? With that, he left the girl behind\nand quickly chased after his little\ngirl. Vivien looked in that direction,\nfurious. Careless. I didn't expect him\nto wake up from my charm incense. I\nreally underestimated him, but there\nabsolutely won't be a second time. Sib\nwas completely unaware of this, only\nfocused on quickly chasing after Lorie.\nAfter catching up to her, he really\nwanted to explain and clear up this\nincident. But it seemed Lori was very\nsulky this time, turning her head to say\nto him, \"I've said it before. I have no\nright to interfere in whatever the\nmaster wants to do with other people.\nHere are the tea and pastries. Please\nhelp yourself, master.\" Lori will be\nleaving now. Seeing her attitude, he\nsighed, \"My little maid is angry and\nstubborn. I can't explain it clearly at\nthe moment.\" Speaking of which, who was\nthat woman who came to me? It was only\nthen that he noticed there were many new\nmaids around him. The kids swirled\naround him, making a lot of noise.\nSeeing this, he was helpless. \"All\nright, this is for you all. Be careful\nnot to drink too much and get a stomach\nache. Don't fight. Share it amongst\nyourselves.\" The others saw Nana getting\nher head patted and quickly started\ncrying, wanting to be patted, too.\nHaving no other choice, he could only\nuse both his arms to pat them one by\none. Seeing such lively little girls, he\nsmiled. They're really just like Lori\nwhen she first arrived. But at this\nmoment, Nah appear behind them. You\nkids, I was wondering where you went\nwhen your work was only half done. Don't\nstand here and bother the Lord. After\nshoeing the kids away, Nenah came before\nhim. I'm very sorry, my lord. They've\nbeen missing you a lot lately. This\nwasn't what he was concerned about. He\nasked back, \"That's right, Nenah. since\nthe last enlightenment. Have you felt\nany particular strange phenomena?\nHearing this, she became very flustered\nthat I'm sorry at this point because she\nwas too ashamed. She shouted, \"I'm\nsorry. I've always been unable to\nsuccessfully awaken.\" Tin high who went\nwith me only had two enlightenments and\nhas already awakened and has already\ngone to the battlefield with you, my\nlord. Only I'm still stuck in the same\nplace now that you, my lord, have to ask\nme yourself. I'm such a failure, aren't\nI? Seeing her reaction, he smiled.\nThere's no need to be so discouraged.\nAwakening requires studying fate. A\nlittle earlier or a little later really\ndoesn't matter. Calm down. Encouraged by\nhim, the little girl happily shouted,\n\"Yes, I will definitely not fail to live\nup to your expectations.\" After\nspeaking, he immediately took out the\nsource of the wild. \"No more wasting\nwords. This time, let's grasp your third\nenlightenment. I wonder what effect it\nwill have on her.\" After speaking, he\nplaced his hand on her head. A torrent\nof mighty golden power continuously\nenveloped Nah's entire body. Her entire\nbody quickly erupted with an\nincomprehensible power that enveloped\nthe area. Along with that were images of\nstone statues continuously appearing in\nher mind. The system panel appeared\ndisplaying her basic stats. Seeing what\nthe system evaluated, even Sibbin was\nstunned. This is truly if you were to\nask what a miracle is, then this is a\nmiracle. It's just a pity the system is\nupgrading. I can't see the details of\nNenah's divine skill clearly, but just\nlooking at the skills, I know it's\nextremely formidable, and as if it were\na matter of course, she could finally\nawaken after her third enlightenment.\nSib also praised her. Nenah, you're very\ngood. Truly formidable. Can you feel\nwhat abilities you've awakened? Tell me\nthe details of their effects. At this,\nshe immediately sensed her power. My\nlord, I have awakened a total of six\nskills. They are mineral collection,\nmineral transformation, mineral blessing\nart, mineral fusion, stone skin, and\nsummon rock golem. Mineral collection is\nto find unlocked minerals. Mineral\nblessing art can increase its\nproduction, but currently I can only\nbless one. I can't feel how much\nincreases. I still need to test it more.\nFusion is to consume energy to fuse two\ntypes of materials together to form a\nnew composite material. It seems like\nit's not very useful. Stone skin is a\ndefensive skill that makes my own skin\nas strong as stone. It can also be\nblessed on your body, but it's not as\nhard as your armor. As for summon rock\ngolem, it's just as the name implies. Of\ncourse, not as good as the heroic spirit\nbrothers. I'm sorry, my lord. Nah is so\nuseless. I only have one combat skill.\nThe other skills are all related to\nbreaking rocks. But contrary to her\nthoughts, he was completely satisfied.\nHow can such a ridiculously powerful\nskill not be useful? If Nah were to go\nto the dwarf kingdom, she would probably\nbe directly revered and worshiped by\nthem as a queen. So, he spoke up to\ncorrect her. It's absolutely not what\nyou think. In fact, your skills are\nextremely useful and can bring us a lot\nof help. Although, I am a lord. I was\npreviously a righteous knight who never\nlies. But you still don't fully\nunderstand your own abilities. I think\nwe should do some tests. So, they\nquickly went to the shipyard. The others\nsaw them and immediately cheered and\nsaid, \"Hello.\" Sib looked ahead and\nreminded them, \"I have no mission today.\nI'm here to find someone.\" The others\nheard this and began to buzz with\ndiscussion. And the person he was\nlooking for looked over in confusion,\n\"My lord, you came to find me?\" Sib\nlooked at him and inquired, \"You are the\ntwerk person.\" The young man with that\nstrange name looked at him and\nimmediately nodded, \"That's me.\" Because\nof a name that person had given him in\nthis world, the atmosphere between the\ntwo became a little silent. Then Sibbon\nstill spoke up. I heard you created a\nstrange artifact called cement. I heard\nit can be used to build rooms, repair\ncity walls, and can make the bricks on\nthe city walls into a single incredibly\nsolid block. Is this true? The twerk\nperson was surprised to hear this. My\nlord, where did you hear this\ninformation? Sib chuckled to himself.\nActually, the information wasn't that\ndetailed, but it's just because I know\nwhat cement is at this time, he\ncontinued. So, my lord, cement really\ndoes have such a great effect. It's just\nthat I'm not having much success right\nnow. The key to making cement is the\nthree stages of grinding, burning, and\nmixing. Although I found a decent main\ningredient, I'm still missing many\nimportant materials. Hearing that, he\nbrought Nah here. So, that's how it is.\nLet me introduce you. This is the maiden\nNenah from Winter Castle. She has an\nability that can transform minerals. I\nwonder if she can be of any help to you.\nHearing that doesn't work person was\nsurprised. What kind of perverse skill\nis this? To directly change the chemical\ncomposition and physical properties of\nsubstance. This is equivalent to\nchanging the very nature of the world.\nHe immediately spoke up. My lord, these\nare two stone samples from my collection\nthat can be made in a lime. The one on\nthe left is hoy dyene thatch, which is\nquite abundant in the opposite mountain\nrange. The one on the right I've named\nMac. Its quantity is extremely rare. If\nshe could transform Hoy Dyene Thatch in\na Mac, then the cement problem will be\nsolved. Sibbin standing beside them\nimmediately encouraged the maid.\nReceiving his blessing, she also gained\nmore confidence. She placed the two\nstones on the ground and used her\nability. A golden light quickly\nappeared, enveloping both of them.\nFinally, a miracle truly appeared before\neveryone's eyes because it had\nsucceeded. Although the size was reduced\nby half, it wasn't a problem at all as\nquantity could be used to make up for\nthe quality. Nah looked at the two of\nthem and smiled. It's done. Take a look.\nDoesn't twerk person almost wanted to\njump up and hug her tightly. It's truly\nmiraculous. His actions scared Nah,\ncausing her to retreat behind him.\nRealizing he might have been too over\nthe top, doesn't work person adjusted\nhis attitude. My lord, if Nenah can\ntransform a large quantity of Mac, then\ncement can be successfully produced.\nHearing that, Sibbon asked if she could\ntransform it more times. And based on\nher estimation, she could perform the\ntransformation a maximum of 10,000 times\na day. This astronomical number left the\nother two speechless. Doesn't work\nperson pondered. She can transform 20\ntons of stone at once. Based on the\ndepreciation rate, it would probably\nrequire 40 tons of hoy dying thatch.\nSuch a production volume is too\nterrifying. Sibbon thought even further.\nWith such a terrifying production volume\nof cement raw material, what if it could\nbe used to transform into gold? No\nsooner said than done, he immediately\nasked her to try turning stone into\ngold. She then immediately used her\nability once more. The stone quickly\nshrank, but gradually its size\ncompletely disappeared. Sibbon wondered,\n\"It's only as small as a grain of rice.\nThe loss rate is that high, but even so,\nit's still very powerful. The continent\nhas no shortage of stone. So much rock\ncan be transformed into a lot of gold.\nNah looked at him and reminded him, \"My\nlord, I'm quite tired. It seems to be\nbecause the material difference between\nthese two types of minerals is too\ngreat. The energy consumed for the\ntransformation is also very high. That\nlast one consumed 1ifth of my energy. If\nI use up all my energy, it will take a\nfull day to recover.\" Knowing that he\ngave up his dream of turning stone into\ngold. Forget it. It's better to have\nNenah transform Stone into Mac to make\ncement with you. But right now, I have\nto go test her other abilities, so we'll\ndo this next time. So, they turned to\nanother inn. The owner looked at the\ngirl before him. My lord, you say this\nlittle demihuman girl can easily fuse\ntwo elemental metals together without\nsmelting. In my whole life working with\nmetals, this is the first time I've\nheard of such a thing. Sibbon used his\nname to guarantee it. Hearing that, the\nowner had no choice. If the Lord says\nso, then I won't be polite. Look at\nthis. This piece of black magic iron was\na gift from my master, a dwarf\ngrandmaster blacksmith. It's a treasure,\nbut unfortunately, my talent is limited,\nand in a lifetime of forging, the most I\ncan make is master grade equipment. My\nlord, could you let her try to fuse it\nwith magic into black magic steel? After\nhe spoke, she immediately used her\nfusion ability on the two pieces before\nher. A miraculous transformation process\nappeared before the blacksmith's eyes.\nHolding the stone in his hand, he was\nstunned. How is this possible to be able\nto achieve such perfect quality with\nbare hands? A complete fusion. How did\nyou do it? Sib reminded him. Don't scare\nthe girl. Demihumans are still afraid of\nhumans right now. So, he adjusted his\nstate. My apologies, my lord. That event\ntruly astonished me. This is a perfect\npiece of black magic steel. This\nhardness, I think even a top tier dwarf\nblacksmith couldn't forge it. Knowing\nthat, Sibbon appeared extremely pleased.\nAfterward, he asked about the energy\nconsumption. She thought for a moment,\nthen replied that it seemed she could do\nit 10 more times. After having basically\nchecked her attributes, he also let her\ngo back to rest. At this moment, he\nunexpectedly spotted Ruer in the crowd.\nWithout hesitation, he quickly rushed\nforward and grabbed her by the shoulders\nand asked, \"Where did you go last night?\nYou didn't come back.\" Hearing this, the\nperson turned around with an admiring\nexpression. It's the Eagle Crest Lord.\nSo, you've been looking for me?\nActually, I've been looking for you,\ntoo. Seeing her clinging to him\nrelentlessly, he immediately stepped\nback. Sorry, I mistook you for someone\nelse. But the woman was as persistent as\na leech. Mistaken identity. No way. Last\nnight, I was willing to be with you all\nnight, and tonight will be the same. And\njust because of a case of mistaken\nidentity, a whole crowd of demihumans\nimmediately ran over to surround him.\nNah was also surprised by this\nsituation. My lord is truly well-loved.\nAs for the person he was looking for,\nshe was preparing for some kind of\nritual. Another person appeared behind\nher. Your highness, the saintist, don't\nbe too nervous. I am Ivan, the pontiff\nof the time, holy temple. This is just a\nmandatory process before your awakening.\nHearing this made her quite surprised.\nThe two men gave a demonic smile,\nlooking at her as if wanting to remind\nher of that night. She had already\naffirmed that she would not leave this\nplace. To her, this was home, and she\ndidn't care much about the time. from\nHoly Temple. But the man was firm,\ncreating a magic orb and saying that if\nshe didn't leave, this whole place would\nbe destroyed. A clock appeared before\nher, allowing her to see the future. It\nseemed the scene of everyone else being\nannihilated appeared in her mind with\nextreme realism. Even her own lord was\ncaptured, bound, and about to be\nexecuted. Seeing that, she fell into\nextreme fear. That is why she now\ndecided to come here to become their\nsaintest. Knowing there was no turning\nback, she sighed, \"If I awaken my\ndivinity, what will happen?\" The man\nquickly replied, \"Of course, you will\nreceive more power and be able to save\nmore people.\" Ivan appeared, whispering\nsweet words into her ear. You have\nalready seen the outcome. If you do not\nresurrect the will of the goddess of\ntime within your body, your beloved\ndemihuman race and the friends you love\nwill depart from this world. Do you\nreally want them to be sacrificed like\nthat? Rule shook her head, showing her\nresolve. No, of course, I will not let\nthis happen. Whether it's everyone in\nthe demihuman tribe or my lord, I will\nprotect them all. Ivan was quite pleased\nto hear that. Your position is truly\nadmirable, and because of it, the power\nof the goddess of time will be even\nstronger. For the sake of those you hold\ndear, please obediently accept your\nfate, your highness, the saintest. But\nshe didn't know that Sibbon had already\narrived in front of the time holy\ntemple. Is this the place? He always\nfelt the angel sculpture looked a bit\nfamiliar. However, his presence had\nattracted the attention of the guards\nhere, but he didn't bother with them and\nimmediately grabbed the by the collar.\nWith a cold gaze, he interrogated,\n\"You're a people of the time, Holy\nTemple.\" After receiving confirmation,\nhe immediately created a golden aura\nthat scared them into retreating and\nquickly rushed straight towards the most\nmajestic part of this place, creating a\nblade that pierced straight towards the\nfront. A huge tremor occurred,\nattracting the attention of those\ninside. Hearing the noise from outside,\nRuer knew her lord had arrived, Ivan\nangrily looked at his subordinates and\nasked, \"What's going on at such a\ncrucial moment?\" They trembled,\nreporting to the pontiff. The\nneighboring church of light was blown up\nby someone. Hearing that, he didn't pay\nit any mind and continued the ritual.\nReturning to Sibbon, he was now\nsurprised to find he had attacked the\nwrong place. The pawniff of the church\nof light appeared who dislikes our\nchurch of light. Are you not afraid of\nbeing punished by God? However, after\nrecognizing his identity, he bowed his\nhead. It is you, my lord. Bishop Vincent\nof the second cathedral greets you. Why\nhave you come here today? Ah, that's\nright. You must have been startled by\nthe commotion and came to check. Is that\nit? As you have just seen, my lord, some\ndamn bastard launched such a terrifying\nattack on our church of light.\nFortunately, there were no casualties,\nbut as you can see, the church roof has\nbeen destroyed. The repairs will cost\nhundreds of thousands of gold coins.\nKnowing that he couldn't continue to act\nrecklessly in this situation, he changed\nthe subject. It must have been those\ndamn heretics. The others looked in that\ndirection and immediately started\ndiscussing animatedly. But Vincent\nimmediately spoke up and asked, \"The\npower of molten flame is mostly related\nto demons. It seems they have appeared\nhere. My lord, did you see who attacked\nour cathedral? Sibbon was also very\nshameless and shook his head. I didn't\nattack. Ah, no. I mean, I didn't see\nanyone attack the cathedral. I only saw\na flash of red light carrying a molten\nbreath. After speaking, he quickly\nlooked towards the guards and ordered\nthem not to reveal anything. Vincent,\nunaware of this, just sighed.\nRegardless, you have provided us with\nenough information. I will order a\nthorough investigation and absolutely\nwill not let any demon wreak havoc in\nthe royal capital. Sib gave an awkward\nsmile. Very good. I trust that you can\ndefinitely eliminate all of those brutal\ndemons. But now I want to ask, where is\nthe time holy temple? Hearing this, the\npontiff pointed towards the opposite\nside. Our church of light and the time\nholy temple are on good terms. The gods\nwe both worship are benevolent. So our\nchurches were built together in this\nsquare. Hearing this, Sibbon couldn't\nbelieve he could have chosen the wrong\none when they were so close. No wonder\nhe met a priest from the time Holy\nTemple here. What a mess. Their churches\nwere all in the same place. I'm not\ntaking the fall for this. My mistake in\nattacking has nothing to do with me who\ntold them to build their churches next\nto each other. He then inquired, since\nthe two sides are so close, I want to\nsee if this place have been affected in\nany way, but are you sure there are\npeople here? The bishop nodded. Although\nthe time holy saintis is a powerful high\ngod, she has never appeared on the\nmaterial plane. So she has very few\nfollowers. This leads to a lack of money\nand due to the lack of funds, they can't\nrepair the holy temple. The church of\nlight helped fund the construction of\nthis whole place. After confirming his\ntarget, Sibbon immediately smiled. Thank\nyou for answering my questions, Vincent.\nIf demons have arrived, the surrounding\nbelievers and priests might be bewitched\ninto saying strange things. I think you\nshouldn't believe anything from the\noutside. Hearing that, he flared up. Of\ncourse, demons are best at bewitching\npeople's hearts. I will personally\ninvestigate. Sib looked at him with\nsatisfaction. Very good. Then please,\nbishop, go back and investigate. I will\ncheck on the condition of the time, Holy\nSus. And so he quickly walked to the\nside, but was stopped by the priests.\nThis is the time holy temple. If you\nwish to go to the church of light,\nyou've gone a wrong way. The church of\nlight is on the opposite side. Siban\nlooked at them and shook his head. I'm\nlooking for the time holy temple. You\nshould know this. Hearing this, they\nwere half believing, half doubting. So,\nyou're a guest of the pontiff, but the\npontiff is performing a ritual and is\nnot receiving guests. Sib knew they\nwould try to stop him anyway. So, he\njust gave a smug smile. It's fine. I'm\nused to it. Just as the ritual inside\nwas about to reach its final part,\nSibbon kicked down their dilapidated\ndoor and entered. So much for stopping\nme. Sibbin entered the holy temple. The\ntemple was quite chaotic at this moment.\nRui saw him enter and called out, \"Lord\nHav.\" The nun beside her also cried out,\n\"How could you?\" Sibbin waved his hand,\nsignaling for her to run to his side.\n\"Roy, what are you doing over there? Get\nover here now.\" She replied, \"Yes.\" As\nshe was about to cross, the nun stopped\nher. \"Stop!\" The ritual is not yet\nfinished. \"You cannot leave.\" The nun\ncontinued, \"Lord voluntarily became the\ntime holy saintest. Please return.\" He\nlaughed loudly. voluntarily. Are you\nkidding me? The nun replied, \"What?\" He\ncontinued, \"Didn't Roy tell you she's my\nmaid? This is the prize for me, saving\nall the demihumans. My maid belongs to\nme. You took her away on your own\naccord. Did you get my permission?\" The\nnun stood there stunned. How\ndisrespectful to dare to speak to the\ntime, \"Holy sist,\" he retorted, taking\nmy maid from my territory. Then, Sibbon\ndrew his sword, which was enveloped in a\ngolden light. Next, he slashed a\nstraight line across the statue with his\nsword. And you dare call me\ndisrespectful? The statue impacted by\nhis sword began to crack. Pontiff run.\nThe holy temple is about to collapse. At\nthis moment, Sibbon had rescued Ruer.\nThe Holy Temple collapsed. He carried\nher and escaped from it. Do you have any\nself-awareness that you're my person?\nShe replied shily. Ah. The nun shouted\nangrily, \"Do you know what you've done?\nYou dare to disrupt the ritual and\ndestroy the time. Holy temple.\" He\nreplied, \"I have something to say to\nyou.\" He said with an angry expression,\n\"Roy is Roy, not the saintest of the\ntime holy temple, and certainly not a\nvessel for the time goddess. If you come\nto Eagle Crest territory to find her\nagain, to make her accept the will of\nsometime goddess, I guarantee that the\nfate of everyone connected to the time\nholy temple will be the same as this\ntime holy temple.\" At this moment, the\nnun was quite frightened by his words.\nThis was her destiny. The awakening of\nthe time goddess is for the entire\ncontinent of K to fight against\nterrifying existences. He said to the\nnun, \"Before you say those words, how\nabout changing the goddess's ambitious\ndestiny? Images of his past experiences\nflash through his mind. He had been hung\non a pillar, seeing Eihow stabbed in the\nchest. He could even change the fate of\nplayers. This protagonist, Yeihow, is\nalready dead. On what grounds should I\ncontinue to believe in destiny? If this\nis destiny, then I will slash destiny.\nRule was stunned when Sibbon took her\nhand. The nun still quite angry said,\n\"You are indeed very strong, but your\nselfishness will bring disaster to can.\nYou simply don't understand the power of\nthe old days.\" He turned and said,\n\"Before talking about salvation, have\nyou ever thought about the one being\nsacrificed? If a world needs an\nunfortunate girl to be sacrificed for\ndemihumans to be saved, then it will\ncollapse sooner or later.\" He walked\naway before the eyes of the people from\nthe holy temple. Before leaving, he\nadded, \"As for the old days, I will face\nthem myself. I have my own convictions.\"\nRui turned to look at him. Seeing him\nsigh, she asked, \"Lord Hav, is it a bit\nbad for us to leave just like that?\" He\nanswered her, \"It's more than good. The\nChurch of Light has money. The entrance\nfee is 10 gold coins. As for the time,\nholy temple, whether they have a holy\ntemple or not doesn't really make a big\ndifference.\" He pinched her cat ear. You\nactually wanted to become the time holy\nsaintis. Don't you think that's absurd?\nShe replied, \"Of course not.\" She turned\nand asked him again, \"Right, how did you\nknow I was at the time holy temple?\"\nAfter hearing Ruer's question, he stood\nstunned for a few seconds, then replied,\n\"Well,\" then he thought, \"It's because\nthe lowly was sulking and ignoring me.\nIt was only when Mrs. Chris came to\nserve me that I realized the lowly\nhadn't returned for a long time. I can't\npossibly say that.\" After thinking, he\nturned and said to her, \"Because you\ndidn't return to the city for a long\ntime and left no message, I went to your\nroom to check.\" Then I found your diary\nand the clock necklace by your bed. It\nsaid you were being followed by a\nmysterious person. Based on the\nkeepsake, I guess it was a scheme by the\ntime Holy Temple. She was horrified when\nshe heard him say he had read her diary.\nRui's face turned red. She said, \"Wait,\nyou said you read my diary? You read\nit?\" Her face grew redder as she\nstammered. \"How much did you read?\" He\nbegan to recount. After the wedding, I\nwill lift your skirt. She grabbed his\ncollar, embarrassed, and said, \"Doesn't\nthat mean you read everything?\" He\ncontinued to recount, \"I went to Shining\nWang Town. I still have an impression of\nthat.\" Little Fox, you can't escape. Did\nI really say that at the time? Don't\neven think about running. She's mine.\nWhen did that happen? He felt\nembarrassed as he read her diary. This\nshouldn't be called a diary. It should\nbe called fanfiction. After she found\nout he read her diary, he grabbed her\nchin and pulled her face close to his as\nif to kiss her, making her very shy. Is\nit okay? It's just a preview version of\nthe diary. Overcome with embarrassment,\nshe vanished before he could react. She\nhid in a bush. Go back by yourself. Just\nsay I'm dead. And remember to burn my\ndiary to ashes, he immediately grabbed\nher tail, causing her great pain. Come\nout, be a good girl, and come back with\nme. He slung her over his shoulder. If\nyou dare to run away from home again,\nI'll print it into a book and distribute\nit nationwide. She cried and wailed.\nDon't scene change. Gabriel was praying\nwhen her face grew increasingly upset.\nThen she smashed something white on the\nground, frightening everyone. That\nhateful man, he actually spanked my\nbutt. And after spanking me, he hung me\non the wall. The people around her\nshouted, \"Lady Gabriel, it's nothing.\nYou all continue praying.\" This is why I\nespecially returned to the main hall to\nbathe in the holy light to wash away the\nsins in my heart and the filth on my\nbody. She was so angry her face was a\nlittle red, but her heart was still\nrestless and couldn't calm down. A\nservant spoke up, \"My lady, the Pope of\nLight, Morgan knows you have returned\nand wishes to see you.\" She replied,\n\"The Pope is looking for me.\" She gently\nstroked her blue hair and said to those\naround her, \"I understand. You may leave\nfirst.\" He replied, \"Yes, my lady.\" She\nwalked away in front of the servants.\nAfter bathing in the holy light, my body\nand spirit have finally become much\npurer. I cannot show any impropriy\nbefore his holiness the pope. She said,\n\"May the light protect you, your\nholiness.\" His holiness the pope here\nwas an old man. He turned around and\nsaid, \"Welcome back, Gabriel.\" The pope\nof light Morgan spoke up and asked,\n\"What is the matter with the necroantic\naura in the Colon Empire that you went\nto investigate?\" Gabriel replied,\n\"Someone set up a soul gathering\nformation.\" She tilted her head,\nthinking of a demon that thousands\nfeared. Then Gabriel continued, \"There\nwas a civil war in the Colon Empire. The\npontiff usurpered the throne, and the\ngreat prince had long been transformed\ninto a vampire prince. He intended to\nuse the soul gathering formation to turn\nthe hundreds of thousands of soldiers\nwho died on the battlefield into a sea\nof undead to dismantle our undead desert\ndefense line from within. Gabriel said\nnonchalantly, \"But it has been resolved\nnow, although it wasn't me who resolved\nit.\" Hearing this, the pope of light,\nMorgan, was delighted and asked eagerly,\n\"There's someone in the Colon Empire who\ncan solve such a difficult problem?\nWhich prince was it?\" Gabriel's face\nflushed red as she replied, \"Not a\nprince, but a lord.\" She recalled the\nhandsome young man with angel wings and\ncontinued, \"He has been acknowledged by\nour angel. When I went there, he was in\na state of divine descent. Moreover, the\nangel who acknowledged him was\nLiewister.\" He asked in surprise,\n\"Leewister? This is a strange matter. I\ndidn't expect that the thorny angel of\nthe god of light's temple would also\nfind a suitable person.\" The Pope of\nLight, Morgan, thought for a moment and\nthen judged. In that case, he's probably\nthe new king of the Colon Empire now.\nGabriel agreed. Yes, it's probably\ncalled the Winter Empire now. He just\nhasn't been crowned yet. The coronation\nceremony will be held in 3 days. Hearing\nthis, he laughed loudly and instructed,\n\"Since he is a partner of the light,\nthen I'll have you write a letter in my\nname. Just say that a legendary level\nholy son of our church of light is\ndealing with the undead invasion in the\nColon Empire and is managing that nation\nwith the authority of a king. I hope\nthey won't panic. Gabriel obeyed. Yes,\nthe Pope of Light suddenly frowned in\nthought, but this letter of mine only\nserves as a warning. After all, he is\nnot a true legendary level. Then he\nturned and gave Gabriel further\ninstructions. The spirits of the\nforgotten land haven't been able to\nchoose their own successor for thousands\nof years. His election must have been a\ncoincidence. For safety, you go help\nhim. Don't let him die in the war.\nAlthough she didn't want to, she\nreluctantly agreed. I understand. And I\nwill take my leave. Later, as Gabriel\nwas stepping out the door, she met a\nmaid servant fumbling with a box. She\nlooked up and said, \"Your Highness the\nSaints, you've returned. I've received\nthe notice and am helping you prepare\nyour luggage.\" She was in no mood to\nlisten to the maidservant. Feeling\nextremely displeased. His holiness the\npope actually told me to protect that\nbastard then angrily punched the mirror\nhard startling the maid servant into a\nscream. Gabriel tried to restrain\nherself and said, \"It's nothing. Go\nabout your business.\" The maid servant,\nnot daring to disobey, stammered, \"Yes,\nyes.\" Gabriel clenched her fists until\nthey trembled. \"The more I think, the\nangrier I get. riding a horse, afraid to\ntake a carriage. Going this slowly, I\ncan delay seeing that detestable face a\nlittle longer. Then she seemed to\nremember something. That's right. Bring\nthat along, too. Gabriel immediately ran\nto a cabinet and pulled out a coil of\nrope, gleefully thinking to herself, \"As\nlong as I have this.\" After that, she\nwrapped the rope around her waist and\nsaid smuggly, \"I can more or less look\nforward to our next meeting.\" Then\nGabriel remembered Pope Morgano's\ninstructions. That's right. The Pope\nalso had me send a message to the\nsurrounding kings. Announce the news of\nthe Winter Empire's king ascending the\nthrone. Although I don't want to,\nthere's no other way. She raised her\nhand to summon a magic circle and began\nto speak. Message from the Church of\nLight. The Holy Sun has descended,\ntaking over the Winter Empire. We hope\nthe kings will coexist peacefully. Once\ndone, Gabriel sent the message\neverywhere. thinking to herself, \"To put\nit simply, the new king of the winter\nempire is the holy son of the Church of\nLight. You kings better not cause\ntrouble. That should be clear enough,\nright?\" The messenger sword flew through\nthe ceiling and embedded itself in the\nground, causing the surrounding soldiers\nto exclaim in panic, \"What the throne\nis?\" They asked each other in confusion,\n\"An enemy attack? No, look closely. This\nis a messenger holy sword from the\nchurch of light.\" The naga who was\nthreatening the king saw the commotion,\nstopped and asked, \"What is this? What's\ngoing on?\" The subordinates immediately\nreplied, \"Your majesty the queen. These\nhumans say it's a messenger holy sword\nfrom the Church of Light.\" Hearing this,\nshe was a bit puzzled. The Church of\nLight? The Naga shivered slightly and\nthought, \"Terrifying power. It seems I\nreally can't stay on this continent for\ntoo long.\" She quickly used her hair to\nwrap tightly around the king, making him\nscream in agony. The Naga threatened\nloudly, \"Hand over the trident, where\nyou will see a tidal wave submerge your\ncountry.\" He cried out in fear, \"Your\nmajesty the queen. It's not that I won't\nhand it over, but I really don't have\nthe sea god's trident.\" Then he turned\nback to look at the artist who had a\nsword to his neck, and continued, \"There\nis no one in my domain who looks like\nthe person in the drawing.\" \"Killing me\nis useless.\" The Naga didn't care much\nabout the king's fear, only thinking\nmaliciously and smuggly. Of course, I\nknow you can't hand it over. The reason\nI beat you up is because I, the Naga\nQueen, cannot stay on land for too long.\nI can only choose you to help me find\nthe trident. How could I be at ease\nletting someone else do it?\" She\nrecalled some old matters and frowned in\nannoyance. \"If that incident hadn't\nhappened, I wouldn't want to set foot on\nthis filthy land either. It turned out\nthat before the sea god, having lost his\ntreasure, flew into a rage and roared,\n\"Who is it that makes other creatures\ntremble in fear?\" He questioned loudly.\nWho took my clan's sacred artifact? The\ntrident. Suddenly, a voice rang out,\ncutting off the Naga's train of thought.\nYour majesty, the queen, please calm\nyour anger. A subordinate came forward\nto report the Quran which has recalled\nthe scene from that time. In the memory\ncrystal, she immediately ordered, \"Bring\nit up.\" He then held up a crystal stone\nwith both hands. The naga took one look\nand immediately scolded in displeasure,\n\"Your fingernails are too long.\" The\nsubordinate exclaimed in alarm, \"What?\"\nThe angrier she got, the tighter she\nsqueezed her hair, injuring the king.\nThe Naga looked into the spirit stone\nfragment and saw an unfamiliar face\nappear. A human. She cursed indignantly.\nGood. Very good. In recent years, my\nNaga clan has been fighting demons in\nthe Stormca region, resisting the\ninvasion of old servants, only to let\nyou humans exploit an opening. The Naga\nthen shattered the spirit stone fragment\nand decided, \"If that's the case, then\nit's time to invade the mainland again.\"\nShe immediately ordered her\nsubordinates, \"Assemble the soldiers,\ncounterattack the mainland. Find him for\nme. Find this person with golden hair\nand armor carrying a great sword on his\nback who stole my sea clan's sacred\nartifact. I want to tear him to pieces,\ngrind him to dust and ashes.\" After\nthat, the Naga forcefully threw the\nportrait at the king's face and\nthreatened, \"If you don't have the\ntrident, then you go find him for me. If\nyou can't find him, I will still turn\nyour country into a sea of water.\" She\nturned and reminded him, \"I'm only\ngiving you half a year. Don't doubt my\nabilities. Remember, the deep sea is\nwatching you.\" He replied, trembling,\n\"Yes.\" After the Naga left, the king\npicked up the terribly drawn portrait\nand looked at it. His face read with\nanger. He tore what was in his hands to\nshreds and roared. Damn it, a drawing\nthat looks like What am I supposed\nto use to find him? These naggas are\ncrazy. They're looking for an excuse to\nstart a war. The subordinates behind him\nquickly spoke up to advise, \"Your\nmajesty the king, please calm down.\" He\nthrew the portrait to the person beside\nhim and ordered sent a letter to King\nKela and asked if he agrees to form an\nalliance. Also asked the newly\nestablished Winter Empire and the\nBeastman royal court 2 go to all of\nthem. Suddenly, someone interjected,\n\"Your majesty the king, please wait.\" He\nsaid, \"We are still at war with the\nbeastmen next to us.\" The king\ninterrupted in displeasure at war. Isn't\nit just raiding for supplies to get\nthrough the winter? He seemed to have\nhis reason completely overwhelmed by\nfear and snapped. \"Whatever these\nbeastmen want, I'll give it to them as\nlong as they agree to resist the naga\nwith me. I want to make that woman pay a\nheavy price.\" The subordinate still\ntried to advise, but your majesty, our\nfood supplies are only just enough.\nFinally, he felt that saying more would\nbe unwise and gave up. Your subordinate\nunderstands. The king suddenly held up\nthe portrait again and ordered, \"Wait,\nfind his person for me, too. Search in\nour country. Search in other countries.\nRelease the spy snakes. If you find him,\ncapture him and bring him to the royal\npalace. I want to grind him to ashes.\"\nKnocking sounds echoed in the quiet\nnight. Knock knock knock. Sib sitting in\nhis study answered, \"Come in.\" Seeing\nthis goodbye, opened the door a crack\nand whispered, \"My lord, sorry to\ndisturb you.\" After saying that, he\npeeked around to see if there were any\nbeautiful women here. Seeing his\nsnooping expression, Sibbon said with\nannoyed disgust, \"That's enough. Hurry\nup and come in.\" Then goodbye, entered\nthe room with a stack of documents as\nhigh as his face, and replied, \"Yes, my\nlord. These are all the documents you\nneed.\" Seeing this, he was startled and\nwondered, \"Why are there so many?\"\n\"Goodbye,\" explained, \"Some of these are\narchival records from Winter City, and\nthere are also books related to the\ndivine realm, elves, demihumans, and the\nPope's letter transported from Fire\nDragon City.\" Then he added, \"This is\nonly a small portion of it. There's\nanother part that hasn't been\ntransported over yet.\" Hearing those\nwords and seeing the stack of papers he\nplaced on the table made him feel\ndaunted. I originally wanted to\ninvestigate the relationship between\ngods and demihumans. I didn't expect it\nto be such a huge undertaking. Sib felt\na headache coming on from this pile. He\nwiped the sweat from his forehead and\nordered, \"Go inform the kitchen to\nprepare some coffee for me. I might be\nsleeping very late tonight.\" Goodbye.\nRespectfully placed a hand on his chest,\nbowed his head, and replied, \"Your\ncommand shall be obeyed.\" As he stepped\nout, Sibbon began to arrange the pile of\npapers into different stacks, comforting\nhimself as he worked. No choice. If I\nwant to be a king, I have to understand\nthese things. Sibbon picked up a book\nwith a yellow cover and began to read.\nWondering the end of the gods. This\nrecords the history of the twilight of\nthe gods. Let's see if I can find any\ntrace of the origin of demihumans. After\nthat, the pages of the book continuously\nappeared along with a story that began\nwith the image of a black dragon. Legend\nhas it that the can continent initially\nhad no intelligent creatures, only\nmonsters until the creator dragon on\nnone came here. She was very fond of\nthis new world. To make the new world\nmore colorful, she created a dragon that\nlooked exactly like herself and based on\nher own power created the gray lightning\ntitan. But the world didn't just have\ntwo types of creatures. That was too\nmonotonous. So Onan continued to create\nthe world tree, the god of death and the\ngod of light. And she ordered them to\ncreate their own subordinate races so\nthat this world could function normally.\nAfter that, Onun was exhausted and\nentered the continent to fall into a\ndeep sleep. The story was so good that\nSibbon became immersed in it and\ncontinued his line of imagination\npicturing two fairies playing on a tree.\nThe elegant world tree inherited half of\nAnon's divine power. She created the\nbeautiful and noble tree spirits and\nhigh elves. In contrast, the god of\ndeath used the heat of death entwined\nwith fire and destruction. He created\ndemons and the undead. As for the other\none, the supreme highest great god of\nlight, he was very fond of wisdom and\nbalance. Therefore, he created humankind\nwith infinite talent, ferocious\nbeastmen, and brave and skilled dwarves.\nUnder his wise leadership, these three\nraces balanced each other and developed\ntogether. Different kinds of people\ntogether created novelty. It was a\nbrilliant age of light. Countless gods\nwere born. Their divine kingdoms filling\nthe starry sky of can until one day a\nhost of twisted wills invaded this\nworld. They were both bizarre and\npowerful. Just their soft whispers could\ndrive weak gods to madness. Phantomike\nfigures with golden eyes shaped like\noctopuses appeared. They called\nthemselves the old ones. The gods called\nthem the elder gods. But everyone do not\nbe afraid. The familiar image of Vincent\nappeared smiling and inviting. Let us\njoin the church of light together.\nBecome believers of the light. No matter\nhow many dangers the future holds, we\ncan face them calmly. The closing line\nof the book was truly remarkable. The\nentrance fee to the church is only 10\ngold coins. Reading up to this point,\nSibbons slumped onto the table in\nfrustration and could only sigh. So,\nthis book was published by the Church of\nLight. But then he sat up, resting his\nforehead on his hand in confusion and\nadmitted, \"The way the Church of Light\nadvertises now is very trendy.\" However,\nhe was helpless. But like this, I can\nonly believe half of the content about\nthe God of Light. Then Sibbon closed the\nbook, placed it on the table, and leaned\nback, lost in thought, based on his\npreliminary understanding of the\ncontinent. The content in this, the end\nof the god's book, although it can't be\nsaid to be entirely true, is at least 70\naccurate. It's completely consistent\nwith some of the things I learned at the\nnight academy, but there's no\ninformation about demihumans in it. The\nbook fell. He questioned helplessly,\n\"Why are records related to them so hard\nto find?\" So then Sibbin analyzed\nfurther if both Winter City and the Fire\nDragon were not options. But suddenly\nsomething flashed on the table,\ninterrupting his train of thought.\nSibbin reached a trembling hand toward\nthe book in doubt. What a wild history\nof the elves. Is this book for real?\nAlthough the cover was a bit\nillustrative and suggestive, Sibbon\nstill forced himself to open it. He\nclosed his eyes and exhaled in denial.\nNo. No. Knowledge is limitless. Only a\ndirty heart sees dirt in everything. One\nmust have a spirit of inquiry and\nlearning. The first few pages of the\nbook were suggestive images of four L's\nthat made him feel ecstatic. Oh wow.\nAfter the twilight of the gods due to\nthe loss of the gods restraint, the wars\nbetween the intelligent races on the\nmain material plane became increasingly\ninscrupulous. Although humanity was weak\nwith short lifespans, they had a very\nstrong learning ability and talent.\nAfter 500 years, humanity's strength had\nexpanded to an unprecedented level. But\nfor the other immortal races, 500 years\nwas just a few short naps. When they\nwoke up, they discovered that human\narmies had already sealed off their\nlayers. At that time, a human king\nappeared and declared, \"You are not\nworthy of these fertile lands. This\ncontinent belongs to humanity.\" A\ngeneration of royalty loudly swore an\noath, opening a fierce battle. Reading\nup to this point, Sibbon sat up straight\nand thought, \"Seriously, what the heck?\nThis book is completely different from\nits illustrations. The content is too\nserious. Could it be trying to trick\npeople into opening and reading it?\" The\nbook's content stated that humanity\nfirst drove the Beastmen to the far\nwestern part of the Endless Desert.\nAfter that, they attacked the elf king\nand then chased the elves into the jade\nforest. Because the living space for the\nelves in the jade forest was too narrow,\na portion of the elves chose to enter\nthe sea to live. They gradually became\nthe Naga Sea tribe as they are now. They\nare brave and skilled fighters in the\nstormy sea region and do not see eye to\neye with the demons near the abyss's eye\nleading to constant friction. A portion\nof the elves who were too weak were\nconsidered a burden and expelled from\nthe jade forest. These elves established\na small kingdom between the humans and\nbeastmen, relying on the treacherous\nmountainous terrain to survive. Reading\nthis part, he was surprised and\npondered. An elf kingdom between humans\nand beastmen. Isn't that the demihuman\nkingdom? A fertile land suddenly\nappeared in his mind as he thought of\nthis. Sib gradually analyzed. So, the\ndemihumans were originally elves like\nthis. The world tree created a total of\ntwo types of elves. Apart from the later\nmutated Naga, the ones now living in the\nelf kingdom are clearly tree elves. So\nthat means the demihumans are actually\nnoble elves. Thinking of this, he closed\nthe book he was reading and found the\nbook a brief history of the elves to\ncontinue. I remember this book seems to\nhave written about it. The world tree\ninherited half of the creation dragon's\ndivine power. That power has infinite\npotential and also gave this\ncharacteristic to the noble elves.\nHowever, to maintain the balance between\nthe noble elves and the tree elves, and\nto not abuse the creation dragon's\ndivine power, the world tree ultimately\nrestricted the bloodline development of\nthe noble elves. Only a few noble elves\nhave enough power in their bloodline to\nawaken their divinity. Based on the two\nbooks he had read, Sibbons seemed to\nhave realized, so that's how it is. Now,\nit could be explained why the demihumans\nawaken abilities are so diverse.\nMoreover, they're also like divine\nskills. However, he was still a bit\nconfused about how to explain the\nvessel. Is it just because of the\nsimilar divinity? Saying that, Sibbon\nsank back into his thoughts. Similar\ndivinity is definitely one of the\nreasons. But there are many things with\nsimilar divinity. Why must it be\ndemihumans who can create the vessel?\nSuddenly, there was a knock on his room\ndoor. Sibbin quickly snapped out of his\nthoughts and said, \"Quin.\" Lorie gently\npushed the door open, holding a tray of\ncoffee, and called out softly, \"Master,\nyour coffee is here.\" She slowly\napproached and saw the messy pile of\npapers on his desk. She asked curiously,\n\"Master, it's so late. You're still not\nresting.\" Sib lazily stretched and\nreplied, \"Hm, almost done.\" Lorie placed\nthe coffee tray on his desk and asked\nagain, \"The war just ended. What is it\nthat's keeping you busy so late?\" Sibbon\ndirectly grabbed her hand and scooped\nher right into his arms, causing Lori to\njump in surprise. He explained, \"I'm\ninvestigating the matter of the\ndemihumans.\" Lori, did you know that\nyour people, the demihumans, were\nactually a branch of the ancient elves a\nvery, very long time ago, also called\nthe Noble Elves. Lorie became excited\nupon hearing this. Noble elves master\nknows this name, too. He was a little\nsurprised and asked back, \"Lori, you've\nheard of noble elves before?\" Lorie\nrecalled the image of a pink-haired elf\ngirl. I heard it before from the mouth\nof the elf slave girl as Celia. She\nsaid, \"I was a noble elf and also said\nsome strange things to me.\" Sib\nsympathized, so that's how it is. No\nwonder you saw that scene of the noble\nelves being driven out of the jade\nforest. That truly is a bloody and\nunforgettable memory. He continued to\nask, \"So, do you know about the vessel?\nDid Ailia ever tell you?\" Lorie wagged\nher tail, hugged him, and answered\nhonestly. Lori doesn't know anything\nabout a vessel. Ailia only said the elf\nqueen is about to fall and hoped Lori\nand the other demihumans who can awaken\nwould go help them. Sib laughed out loud\nand assessed. I think she's just\ndaydreaming. He already had his own\ncalculations in mind. Although\nabandoning the burden was a wise choice\nin that harsh living environment. What\ngoes around comes around. Now wanted to\nask the exiled noble elves to return and\nhelp is simply daydreaming. On the\nsurface, Sibbon dotingly patted Lor's\nhead and said, \"Don't worry. The elf\nqueen won't collapse that easily.\" But\nin his heart, he thought the key point\nis that it's an invitation for noble\nelves, not including the demihumans who\ncannot awaken. He affectionately hugged\nLorie and continued. The Jorder was\noriginally the Allied forces and the Jia\nEmpire. Now that the Colon Empire's army\nhas withdrawn, only the Allied forces of\nthe two empires are blocked there. The\npressure on the elf queen has lessened a\nlot. Lorie snuggled into his chest,\npouting. Lori is just master's little\nmaid, not some noble elf. He could only\nhelplessly pat her. All right, my little\nmaid is so good. Sibbon recalled Ru's\nimage and silently grumbled. She should\nreally learn from my Lorie's\nperceptiveness, not just run away from\nhome at the drop of a hat. The male lead\nhugged Lorie tightly, who couldn't help\nbut feel shy. Master, you're terrible.\nIt's still working hours. He looked at\nher with a pitiful expression. I've been\ncriticized. Lorie couldn't resist his\ncharm and shouted, \"Aw, really?\" After\nsaying that, she jumped off Sibbon's\nlap, her tone carrying a hint of\nscolding. During working hours, you\nshould work seriously. As for him, he\nwas just mesmerized by her previous\naction, silently delighted. Wow, just\nlike a squirrel. Suddenly, Sibbon\nremembered something important and\nseriously gave an order. That's right.\nGo call Aelia over. I have something to\nask her. Lorie misunderstood a little\nand stammered, asking back. B because I\nsaid we can't during working hours.\nMaster is changing to someone else to\nserve you. Hearing this, Sibbon couldn't\nhelp but freeze up. I want to ask her\nabout the noble elves. You should listen\nin too because of Lor's sentence. He\ncouldn't help but doubt himself. Am I\nthat untrustworthy? Lorie ran off in\nembarrassment. Her face as red as a\ntomato. I know. I'll go get her right\naway. After a moment, Lorie opened the\ndoor and said respectfully, \"Master,\nI've brought her.\" Sibin replied,\nKain. The moment Ailia stepped in, he\nimmediately noticed her hot figure. She\nbowed politely to greet him and asked,\n\"Lord, I heard you have something to ask\nme.\" Under Sibbon's leerous gaze. Lorie\nimmediately turned to look at him with a\nwarning. Sibbon sidestepped and\nexplained, \"I was looking at her elf\nsignal.\" Sibbon adjusted his demeanor\nand got to the main point. \"That's\nright. It's related to you elves. Do you\nelves have any records related to the\ndivine vessel, especially related to the\nnoble elves?\" Ailia hesitated a bit and\nreplied, \"I don't have any about a\nvessel related to noble elves, but I\nknow a little about a divine vessel. I\ncan tell you, but you have to agree to\none condition of mine.\" Hearing this, he\nlaughed non-stop, \"Ha, you can choose\nnot to tell me, but I will throw you off\nthe terrace.\" She replied in\nastonishment, \"How could you?\" Sibbon's\nvoice was full of challenge. \"So, do you\nwant to try?\" Through this matter, he\nalso silently concluded, \"I used to\nthink this elf was very ungrateful. But\nafter seeing the materials I found\ntoday, the tree elf clan probably hates\nhumans very much.\" Perhaps this issue is\nno different from the one between me and\nthe first prince. If being nice to her\nis useless, I'm too lazy to waste my\neffort. At this point, Ailia had to\nconcede. All right. All right. I know.\nShe began to recount. I once saw a\npassage like this in a book before the\nworld tree fell into silence. It divided\nits divine power and will into countless\nparts and poured them into many wise\nancient trees that had gained sensience.\nThese wise ancient trees will become\nvessels for the awakening of the world\ntree. Suddenly, Sibbon asked, \"So, have\nyou succeeded in reviving the world tree\nyet?\" Ailia shook her head and replied,\n\"If her majesty the world tree had been\nrevived, we wouldn't be trapped in the\njade forest.\" She continued to explain,\n\"After her majesty the world tree fell,\nmany things disappeared. We only need to\nfind enough items with divinity related\nto her majesty the world tree. For\nexample, branches of the world tree, for\nexample, the lost scepter of life. Only\nthen can we increase the speed of her\nmajesty the world trees revival.\" After\nhearing the whole story, Sibbin rested\nhis chin on his hand and pondered, \"So\nthat's how it is.\" No wonder the human\nallied forces want to pursue and besiege\nthe elven royal court in the jade\nforest. The revival of the world tree,\nalthough a good thing for K, is a\ndisaster for the human empire. When it\nwas over, he waved his hand, ordering\nAilia to leave. \"All right, you may\nleave for now. I'll call you again if I\nneed you.\" Ailia replied with some\nregret. \"Yes.\" Sib began to sink into\nthought again. So the second stage of a\ndemihumans's awakening requires finding\nrelics with divinity. But after\nawakening, it will make them more\nsuitable to become vessels for the gods.\nBut if they don't awaken, sooner or\nlater the will of those silent gods will\nfind a way to find them. This is a death\nloop. There must be some way to break\nit. He sighed wearily and continued to\nthink. The silent gods are very weak. If\nthe will and power of an awakened\ndemihuman are strong enough, can they\ncompete against them? Searching for\ndivine relics to accelerate the\ndemihumans's awakening enough for them\nto become strong enough. Preparing in\nadvance to deal with the gods is\nprobably the best solution. Lorie\nworriedly knelt right beside him,\nmassaging his shoulders and asking,\n\"Master, is something troubling you?\"\nSib said doing, \"It's not really a\ntrouble. It's just that it's very likely\nyour master will have no choice but to\nturn the entire continent an upside\ndown.\" Looking at the cute cat girl in\nhis arms, he felt a secret happiness so\nthat you all can continue to live\nhappily. Arriving back at his room,\nSibbon quickly opened the system panel.\nHello, system. The only reply was a\nmechanical voice. System is updating.\nPlease figure it out yourself if you\nhave any requests. Seeing this, he\nsighed in frustration. Still not done\nupdating. The system update time is so\nlong this time. Forget it. I should go\ncheck on the coronation ceremony\npreparations. How things were going. Out\nin the main hall, the maids were\nbustling with work when suddenly a maid\nin a purple dress recognized Sibbon. Oh\nmy lord. Hearing this, the other maids\nalso began to clamor. Hey, it's the\nLord. Good morning, Lord. Faced with\nsuch an enthusiastic welcome, Sibbon\nbeamed with delight and replied, \"Hello,\ngood morning.\" He asked the personal\nattendant beside him, \"Mrs. Chris, who\nare these people?\" She covered her mouth\nand said with a smile, the coronation\nceremony will be held in 2 days. The\nWinter Castle's manpower was a bit\ninsufficient, so we hired some new\nmaids. We're now teaching them etiquette\nand rules. The new maids continuously\nsurrounded him, causing his face to\nflush red. So, that's how it is. You've\nworked hard, Mrs. Chris. Chris smiled\nwith satisfaction. I am willing to\ndedicate myself to you. Sibbon sat on\nthe throne with the sweet young maids\nsurrounding and serving him, and he\nexclaimed in delight. So, this is it. Is\nthis the blissful joy of a monarch?\nAlthough it's not like one can just\nenjoy this pleasure without doing\nanything. The maid beside him, seeing\nhis sudden change in attitude, asked in\nconfusion, \"My lord, suddenly he called\nout loudly.\" \"Is everything ready?\"\nClement. The old butler respectfully\nreported, \"Yes, the great nobles and\nlords of the Cologne Empire have all\narrived and are waiting in the\nconference room.\" Sib's face gradually\ngrew grim. \"Very well, let's go over\nthere.\" In the conference room, the\nofficials were buzzing with discussion.\nI heard the new king has abolished the\nBA church. I wonder what new church will\nappear. Another official said he hasn't\neven been coronated yet and he's already\nsummoned us. Of course, he must want to\nwin us over, right? It doesn't matter.\nWe just need to see the sincerity of\nthis new king. Sib slowly entered with\nClemont following behind. He said in a\nclear voice, \"Everyone, I believe you\nall know the reason for convening this\nmeeting, so I will be brief. Please read\nthe distributed draft carefully first.\"\nAfter he finished speaking, Clement\ndistributed the documents to the\nofficials one by one. At the table,\nafter reading the draft, they were in an\nuproar again. What is this, the Winter\nCode draft? Weren't we supposed to talk\nabout the coronation and the church? Sib\nsat down solemnly and continued to\nexplain. Right now, all territories in\nthe Winter Empire lack managers, and\nriots have even occurred. This is a code\nI have drafted to help everyone manage\ntheir territories better. There are many\ndetailed clauses, but they're mainly\ndivided into three major sections. One,\nabolish all taxes except those set by\nthe king. Two, abolish the slave system\nand implement free contracts. Three,\nchange the hereditary succession system.\nAll descendants of nobles can no longer\ninherit their family's fftoms and must\npass the empire's examination. Suddenly,\nan official in a purple robe stood up\nabruptly, slammed the table, and\nobjected. Your highness, this decree is\nunreasonable. This is fundamentally\ncutting off the foundation of the\nempire's strength. Doing so will only\nmake the empire weaker and weaker. No\none will follow you, your highness. Sib\ndidn't say much and directly gave an\norder. Drag this man out and hang him.\nThe guards immediately complied and\ndragged him out. Yes, young master. The\nofficials face turned pale with fear,\nand he stammered, begging, \"Wait, wait,\nyour highness, I was wrong. I am willing\nto follow your orders, your majesty,\nSibbin, lounging on his chair, said with\nsatisfaction. Are there any other\nopinions? None. If there are none, this\ncode will be implemented starting now. A\nhand was raised, attracting Sibbon's\nattention. Your Majesty the king.\nAnother blonde lord stood up, smiling as\nhe spoke. We are very willing to\ncooperate with you and implement this\ncode. As soon as he finished, he\ncunningly asked further, but\nimplementing the code requires a lot of\nmoney, time, and manpower. I just wonder\nif your majesty the king can give us\nenough support. Hearing this, Sibbon\nalso narrowed his eyes and replied with\na smile. No need to worry. Then he\ncursed inwardly. If I hadn't been unable\nto find talented people to manage the\nterritory for the time being, and the\nreforms had to be carried out step by\nstep, I would have removed these tumors\nlong ago. Thank you all for your\ncooperation. The Winter Empire is in a\ndifficult situation. To make it more\nconvenient for you to promulgate the\nlaw, I will dispatch a wyvern knight to\nhelp each of you. Under the\nindescribable gaze of his own butler,\nSibbin, with an unchanged smiling face,\nface the people there. A banquet has\nbeen prepared. Everyone can go to the\nbanquet to celebrate. As for which\nthiefts you will be assigned, you can\nfind out directly from Clemont. With\nthat, he turned and walked away,\ninstructing, \"Cleont, help me take good\ncare of the nobles and lords. As you\ncommand, my lord.\" A moment after Sibbin\nleft the conference room, goodbye rushed\nover from a distance with a panicked\nlook. This is bad, my lord. Seeing who\nit was, Sibbon couldn't help but sigh.\nWhy is it that every time I see you, you\nstart with that line? Hearing this,\ngoodbye was on the verge of tears. A\ntear rolling down the corner of his eye.\nYou're right. Without wasting time,\nSibbon calmly asked, \"All right, what's\ngot you so panicked?\" Goodbye quickly\nreplied. Actually, seemingly hearing\nsome unexpected information, he was a\nlittle surprised. What? Sibbon asked as\nhe walked briskly, inquiring. You're\nsaying a thief broke into the royal\npalace under your strict guard and took\nthe crown without a sound. Seeing the\ntruly empty crown box before him,\nGoodbye was somewhat devastated, crying\nand admitting his guilt. My lord, we\nwere truly patrolling very carefully,\nbut didn't see anyone enter. The\ncoronation ceremony is about to be held.\nNone of the brothers dared to let their\nguard down. Hearing this, Sibbon held\nthe piece of paper left in the case,\nwhich still had a trace of my asthma,\nand replied, \"I know.\" A moment later,\nthe small trace of myasma from the paper\nquickly clung to his hand. As if\ndiscovering something, his beautiful\nblue eyes couldn't help but show a look\nof surprise. There was something under\nthe cloth. Goodbye. Beside him, seemed\nto realize it too, and immediately drew\nhis sword, rushing forward. My lord, on\nthe other side, Sis Rueer and Lori also\nnoticed something was not right and\nshouted loudly, \"Master, be careful.\"\nJust as Lorie finished speaking, Saint\nRueer rushed forward, kicking at the\ncloth and quickly pushing Sibbon back.\nThen she looked at Sibbon's arm with\nsome concern. \"Sibbin, your arm.\" He\ncalmly reassured her. \"It's fine. It's\njust a bit of mythma that was attached\nto the object.\" With that, he smiled and\nwaved his hand innocently. But Lori was\nnow hugging his arm, crying with\nheartache. Master, it must hurt a lot.\nSaints Rue also angrily scolded. How is\nthis fine? You really are faced with a\nconcern from the two people before him.\nSib spoke up with Lorie here. It's a\nsmall matter. Don't worry. Hearing this,\nlittle Lorie immediately used her\nhealing arts. I know Lorie will heal\nyour arm right away. Sibbon was now\nlooking grimly at the lingering myasma\non the items in the room, thinking\nnon-stop. The problem is that the\ntreasures here are all tainted with\nmyasma. It seems someone doesn't want me\nto ascend the throne smoothly as his\ntrain of thought ended. He opened his\nmouth to give an order. Seal the scene.\nNo one is to touch anything in here.\nYes. As for the one who refused to\ntoast, let him taste the forfeit. Inside\nthe conference room, everyone had joined\nthe party, chatting animatedly. The\natmosphere became extremely lively. The\nman who had voiced his opinion to Sibbon\nearlier held a glass of red wine and\nsneered. Being able to issue a law is\nnothing. Being able to actually\nimplement it is what truly matters. The\nsoldiers seem to hear commotion. This\nmeans that the count has a way to deal\nwith this new king. Edward smiled\ncalmly, naturally believing that it\nwouldn't be long before he would be on\nhis knees begging me. The soldiers grab\nhim. Wh what? Suddenly, Clemon\napproached. Count Edward, he said with a\nserious expression. Please come with me.\nOur lord has invited you. The blonde man\npanicked. Wait, wait a minute. There\nmust be some misunderstanding. It's best\nto follow his majesty. The king's will.\nIt should be so. Fuga. Edward was thrown\noutside brutally. He shouted\nresentfully. What are you doing, you\npeople? I am. Suddenly, Edward seemed to\nhave bumped into someone. He looked up\nand saw him surprised. Vivien. Sib\nsmirked. As expected, you sent this\nsuccubus to seduce me, didn't you?\nEdward stammered. \"Why, your majesty,\"\nSibon replied. \"Unfortunately, such a\nshameless trick has no effect on a\nrighteous and powerful knight like me.\nIs the theft of the crown also related\nto you?\" Edward pleaded. \"Your majesty,\nplease see clearly. It really wasn't me.\nI didn't steal your crown. You have no\nevidence to prove I did this.\" Sib\nlaughed coldly. \"You tried to use a\nhoney trap to seduce me, and in turn,\nyou asked me for evidence. Ridiculous.\"\nLori immediately thought, \"A succubus?\nNo wonder master was so entranced back\nthen. I misunderstood him. The blonde\nman's face turned pale. How did you know\nthe plan? Unless you were monitoring us\nall along. That's right, Sibbon\nexplained with a wicked smile. At first,\nI discovered someone was watching me in\nWinter City. So, I had Allan go to\nvarious countries to plant spies under\nthe guise of delivering letters. Well,\nnow, do you have any last words? Edward\nknelt down. I beg you to spare me. From\nnow on, I will definitely follow your\norders and honestly implement the law. I\nbeg you to give me a chance. Sibbon\nasked gently. Count Edward, do you know\nwhy I could be king? You can only\nstammer. Whin replied. Because as a\nvillain, I never give people a second\nchance. Sibbon then called the soldiers\nmen drag him away to be dragon food.\nEdward then spoke defiantly. You You\nthink anyone will obey that law? Without\nmy support, your rule will surely be\noverthrown. Sib smiled lightly with\nconfidence. You think too highly of\nyourself. Lori then asked, \"Master, did\nhe really not steal the crown?\" Sibon\nthen said, \"No, stealing the crown can't\ncompletely stop my coronation. This is\nmore like a prank.\" Lorie asked,\n\"Seriously, but now without the crown,\nwhat about the coronation ceremony\ntomorrow?\" Sibbon continued, \"Then we\ncan only have someone make another\ncrown,\" he called out, \"Nah, let's go to\nthe forge.\" \"Yes, Loly, you stay here\nwith the priest and help me deal with\nthe myasma in the treasury room.\"\nArriving at the forge, the master\nblacksmith looked surprised. \"What?\nForge a new crown within a day.\" \"Lord,\nyou must be joking, right?\" Sib smiled,\nthinking, \"Actually, it's half a joke.\"\nHe He said, \"So, it really can't be\ndone, right?\" The shop owner replied, \"A\nnormal crown is made of rare metals. The\nraw materials are scarce. Even if we had\nenough materials, under these\ncircumstances, it would be very\ndifficult to complete unless we can find\na master dwarf who is skilled in weapon\nforging.\" Sibbon was bewildered a dwarf.\nThe craftsman then waved his hand,\nsaying, \"You probably know that in terms\nof weapon forging, humans are far from\nbeing on par with dwarves. Besides, I\ndon't have any rare metals here at all.\"\nSib thought to himself, \"That's true. If\nhuman craftsmen could casually reach the\nsame level as dwarves, then reviving\nSarris wouldn't be so difficult.\"\nSuddenly, Nenah's eyes lit up and she\nsaid, \"Lord Commander, if you want to\nfind a rare metal vein, I think I can\nsense it.\" Lorie said, \"Nah.\" Sibbon\nsuddenly asked, \"Really? Where?\" Nina\nreplied, \"Go 8 km in that direction.\"\nThe craftsman then said, \"8 km away is\nthe frozen lake.\" Sibbon then said, \"It\nseems we have to take a trip to the\nfrozen lake.\" Then, \"Does the blacksmith\nhere have any horses?\" The blacksmith\nreplied, \"We do, but only two.\" Sibbon\nsmiled and said, \"It's fine. It's fine.\nThat's a small problem.\" As they were\nwalking through the forest, Nenah said,\n\"Once we pass through this forest, we're\nalmost there.\" Suddenly, Nenah cried out\nin alarm. Lord Commander, it's over\nthere. Oh. Lorie smiled and said,\n\"Actually, the frozen lake wasn't called\nthe frozen lake before. When the\ndemihuman kingdom still existed, we\ncalled it the angel's eye. It's\nbeautiful, isn't it?\" Sibban nodded in\nagreement. \"It is indeed very\nbeautiful.\" Lorie continued, \"Havey, do\nyou know why it's called the Angel's\nEye?\" Sib asked back, \"Why?\" Lorie then\nrecounted, \"Legend has it there was no\nlake here before.\" Then one day, a large\nstar trailing a pale flame crashed down\nhere. It took hundreds of years for a\nlake like this to gradually form. The\nprevious demihuman saintist told me that\nwhat fell was not a star at all, but the\neye of an angel. Sib asked in\nastonishment, \"What do you mean the eye\nof an angel?\" This previous sist was\neither talking nonsense or was overly\nromantic. He continued, \"The supreme\nexistence in the world of can is the\ncreation dragon unknown. Where would an\nangel come from? The so-called eye of an\nangel. I think it's just a meteorite\nthat fell, albeit a rather large one.\nBut if it was a meteorite that fell,\nthen there's an 80 to 90% chance that\nthe rare metal vein is real. Suddenly,\nan explosion sounded from a distance.\nNah looked bewildered. Sib said, \"Why\nwas there an explosion over there? Let's\ngo take a look.\" Nah replied, \"Okay, but\nthat's a gravel beach over there. We\nshould get off our horses and walk\nover.\" As they got closer, they came\nacross a dwarf with a furious redeyed\nexpression by the stone head above. The\nangry dwarf stomped his foot hard on the\nground and roared. \"Damn it, I'll\ndefinitely skin that rotten brat. What\ndid he add to the gunpowder? If I hadn't\nrun fast, my beard would have been\ngone.\" Sib thought happily to himself.\nIt's actually a dwarf and a level 61 at\nthat. An effortless find. Suddenly, the\ndwarf turned his head to look. Who's\nhiding there? Shuted. Donji. The dwarf\nslammed his fist on a large rock,\nforcing the three of them to jump back\nto avoid it. Sibon then said, \"Lori,\nwait. I want to recruit this dwarf.\nDon't use force.\" Nah replied, \"Huh, but\nhe looks very hostile towards us.\"\nSibbon smiled and replied, \"I know that.\nJust the fact that he hates humans is\ntroublesome enough. The key is that I\nstill don't know why. Could it be that\nhis tribe was once attacked by humans?\"\nLanding on the ground, Sibbon continued,\n\"In this situation, we can only force a\nconversation. The dwarf looked at them\nand said angrily, \"Humans and a\ndemihuman.\" With a furious glare, he\nslammed his fist on the ground. The\ndwarf shouted, \"Human, back off. Leave\nthis place or I won't mind turning you\ninto minced meat.\" So annoying. We came\nall the way from the southern continent\nto the northern continent, thinking we\ncould rest for a few days. Who knew that\na prince from the Cologne Empire would\nsuddenly appear and steal more than 10\nof our king of the hill siege cannons?\nDespicab.\nSib stepped forward, smiling cheerfully.\nHello, esteemed dwarf master. It's a\npleasure to meet you. I heard a\ncommotion over here and came over out of\ncuriosity. If I've disturbed you, I\napologize. Sibon had an idea. From what\nhe knew about dwarves, besides their\nstrong personalities and love for\nforging, they had two other traits. They\nloved to drink and to be flattered. For\nbetter or worse, I have to give it a\ntry. The master was now staring at the\nthree people standing opposite him, he\nsaid, flustered. Human, you're quite the\nsmooth talker. I'm looking for a mineral\nvein here. Don't bother me, and I can\npretend you were never here. Sib looked\nat the master in alarm, looking for a\nmineral vein, but this is Lord Havy's\nterritory, sir. The master's face\ndarkened. Lord Commander, Sibbon smiled\nand said, That's right, but Lori, it's\nokay. He flashed a bright smile and\nsaid, \"After all, for a respected dwarf\nmaster to search for a mineral vein in\nmy territory is my honor, master. As you\ncan see, I am the Lord Commander of this\ngeneration, and I'm also currently\nlooking for a mineral vein. Have you\nfound a vein you're looking for? Perhaps\nI can help you.\" The master looked at\nhim and said, \"You looking for or?\" Then\nhe shook his head and looked at the two\ngirls with sibbon. He sighed to himself,\none man and two women. No matter how you\nlook at it, it seems like they're on a\npicnic. What kind of or are they looking\nfor? Then he continued, I haven't found\nthe vein yet, but your attitude as a\nhuman isn't bad. Out of respect for you\nbeing the Lord Commander of this place,\nI can help you look, but after we find\nit, if it contains the vein I need, you\nmust give it to me unconditionally. Sib\ngave a friendly smile. Esteemed dwarf\nmaster, this maid of mine can find\nmineral veins extremely quickly. Perhaps\nI can really help you. The master was\nastonished. A maid? Are you insulting\nme? He continued, \"Please don't be\nangry. I have no intention of insulting\nyou.\" He was quite angry and blue sparks\nemanated from around him. A little maid\nhelping me find a mineral vein. \"If this\nis an insult, what is? Is finding a\nmineral vein some kind of lowly job?\"\nSib's face showed great satisfaction\nwith the dwarf's reaction. He took the\nbait as expected. He continued,\n\"Although this sounds absurd, it is\nindeed true. How about this? Why don't\nwe make a bet? If you find a mineral\nvein before my maid, I will give you\nthis entire vein. If my maid finds it\nfirst, you will work for me. But you can\nstill take whatever minerals you want\nfrom the ore. How about it? He was\nsilent for a moment. Then said, \"Human\nlord commander, this was your ultimate\ngoal, wasn't it? But I cannot work for a\nhuman. Whether your maid can find a\nmineral vein or not has nothing to do\nwith me. But even so, I will still bet\nwith you for the glory of the dwarven\nrace. If you lose, then banish your\nignorance for my sight. If you win, I\ncan forge a heroggrade weapon for you\nfor free. I'll provide the materials.\nSib looked at Nenah and said, \"It's a\ndeal.\" Nah. It's all up to you. She\nreplied to him. Yes, Lord Commander. She\nplaced both her hands on the ground. At\nthat moment, a golden light mixed with a\nbit of red and orange radiated from her.\nAfter she finished, the master looked\nvery smug. Little girl, I don't want to\nmake things difficult for you. If you\nwant to blame someone, blame your\nmaster. Just then, Nah exclaimed\nexcitedly, \"Lord Commander, I found it.\"\nSib gave her a thumbs up, signaling she\ndid a great job. Hearing her words, the\nmaster couldn't believe his eyes. \"How\ncan be so fast?\" \"Little girl, you're\ntrying to trick me, aren't you?\" Nina\nreplied, \"No, I really found it.\" \"There\nare two locations in total, one\nunderwater and one by the lake.\" \"The\none by the lake is under that rock\nwall.\" Everyone looked toward the rock\nwall. He laughed contemptuously and\nsaid, \"Little girl, you've slipped up,\nhaven't you? I've already searched this\nplace. See this black mark? I blew that\nup. So, there can't be a mineral vein\nhere, she said while pointing to her\nhead. The ore. That's because it's not\ndeep enough. At this moment, a golden\nlight similar to when she was searching\nfor the vein appeared. This vein is not\nan exposed or surface vein, but is a\ndepth of 16 m. The master stepped on a\nrock and said 16 mib.\nAfter blasting the surface layer, I\nobserved the structure of the geological\nrocks here. They are very tightly\nconnected and belong to the same type of\nrock. Clearly layered and with no signs\nof patching or fractures. This indicates\nthat the rock masses here were formed in\nthe same period. So even if it's a dozen\nmeters deeper, it will still be the same\nrock layer. There can't be a mineral\nvein. Sib thought to himself, could it\nbe that this rock wasn't formed\nnaturally, but is the meteorite that\nLorie mentioned? After all, the dwarf\ncame through the death desert from the\nsouthern continent. So, of course, he\nwouldn't know the story of the frozen\nlake. Then he reassured the dwarf.\nMaster, no need to rush. Whether it's\ntrue or false, we'll know by digging\ndown 16 m to check. We just need to do\nthis. Sib slammed his weapon on the\nground, creating a light that surrounded\nhim, and rocks flew out from the ground.\nThis human strength is terrifying. The\nmaster was now astonished, not believing\nwhat was in front of him. No, it can't\nbe. This light, it's actually thunder\ngold. for the master was very surprised\nto see the mineral vein. There really is\na mineral vein. How did you do it?\nSibbon maintained his cheerful smile and\nsaid to the master, \"Well, master, we\ndidn't lie to you, did we?\" He replied\nto him, flustered, stone head in the\nsky. \"This this is too absurd. How is\nthis possible?\" Sib replied to him. \"It\nseems you also admit that we've won.\nThen please forge a hero great equipment\nfor me.\" The master stroked his beard\nand said of, \"Of course, a dwarf's word\nis his bond. What is said must be done.\nIt's just that my forge isn't here. If\nyou don't mind, I'll go move it. Now,\nSibbon replied, aren't you considering\ncoming to my territory? Not to mention,\nyou can use all of this freely. My mate\nalso knows many skills besides finding\nmineral veins. For example, transmuting\none ore into another or perfectly fusing\ntwo ores together. Then, Sibbon handed\nhim something that looked like a stone.\nThe thing he handed over had golden\nveins, sometimes with a bit of reddish\nbrown on a purple background. The master\nwas shocked when he received what he was\ngiven. Transmuting fusing gore. This two\ntypes of materials can actually be\nperfectly fused together without a\nsingle flaw. The respective properties\nof the materials are fully brought out,\neven enhanced beyond their original\nbase. I've lived for 308 years, and this\nis the first time I've seen black demon\nsteel. This is a divine miracle, he said\nto Sibbon, \"Human, you possess a supreme\ntreasure. This is not just wealth, but\nalso formidable military strength.\" He\nstill wore a friendly smile and said,\n\"Thank you for the high praise.\" Two\nsmall flames appeared in his eyes. \"No,\nyou don't understand. The rare materials\non the continent of can are limited.\nThis leads to extremely few high-end\npieces of equipment. But now you make\ncan break this rule. I'm not afraid of\nyou laughing, but the entire Warhammer\ntribe has a total of only 20 King of the\nHill siege cannons, precisely because we\nlack the key materials to craft the\nintegrated components. The Master now\nseemed quite irritated, but now we don't\nhave many left. It was stolen by a human\nprince. My injuries back then were even\nworse than now, and my clansmen had no\nstrength to resist. Everyone around\nlooked at him with a puzzled expression.\nCibbon turned to Ruer and asked quietly,\n\"The king of the hill siege cannons.\nCould it be?\" She replied, \"It was that\nfirst prince. I remember that first\nprince Hinn bought the siege cannons\nfrom the dwarf clan, but it turns out he\nstole them.\" Then these dwarves are too\npitiful. Invaded in the southern\ncontinent and robbed after fleeing to\nthe northern continent. The master held\ntwo hammers in his hands and said,\n\"That's right. It was that first prince\nCologne something. Damn it. Do you know\nhim? Do you know where he is? If I ever\nmeet him, I will definitely use my\neternal hammer to thrust it into his\nbackside to let him know the\nconsequences of angering the dwarfs.\nThis is a long story, so that's how it\nwas that damn guy. At this moment,\nflames of anger appeared around the\nmaster. A good death. The only regret is\nthat I wasn't the one to personally\nthrust the eternal hammer into his\nbackside. Sibbon stared at him blankly.\nYour tastes are quite heavy. The master\ncontinued, \"Therefore, you are now\nactually the king of this country.\" He\nreplied to the master. I haven't been\ncoronated yet, so I'm still the lord.\nThe master thought for a moment, then\nturned and pointed at him. But even so,\nI still won't work for you, but I can go\nto your territory. I'll forge the hero\ngrade equipment you need. I can even\nstay there, but I might might sometimes\nneed your maid to help me synthesize\nsome ores. Of course, I will pay or I\ncan trade for it with crafted equipment.\nSo, how is this different from working\nfor me? As long as Nenah acts as the\nmediator, Sibbon thought to himself,\n\"Well, then that's fine. Here's to our\nhappy cooperation.\" The master shook\nhands with him and said, \"You humans are\nstill considered reasonable.\" Sib\nthought to himself, \"Once you're in my\nterritory, I'll naturally have a hundred\nways to make you stay willingly. Then we\ncan't delay. You wait here for a moment.\nI'll immediately go back to the tribe to\nhandle some matters. I'll definitely\nbring my tools back before noon.\" The\nmaster said to Sibin, \"I swear by the\ngreat stone head and Moridin that I will\nreturn on time. A dwarf's promise is as\ngood as gold.\" She said to him, \"Havey,\nwill he really come back?\" He replied,\n\"Based on the dwarf's passion for\nforging, he will definitely come back as\nlong as Nenah is here.\" He turned around\nbut couldn't see Nenah anywhere. Then\nsuddenly Nenah shouted, \"Lord,\" he\nturned to see her leading two people\nbehind her. \"Ah, we found the Lord.\nShouldn't we be calling you your majesty\nthe king?\" Both of them greeted Sibbon.\nHello, your majesty the king. Sibbin was\nsurprised Marotto by it. Why are you two\nhere? Sibbin patted the two girls' heads\nand said gently, it's not safe to run so\nfar away. Reminded by Sibbon, the brown\ncatgirl replied cheerfully. It's okay.\nThe white catgirl also said, \"Your\nmajesty, please don't worry. My big\nbrother came too. He came with the fat\nchef uncle to buy fish for you.\" Hearing\nthis, Sibbon thought by its big brother\nseems to be the werewolf Otto. With him\nby their side, there shouldn't be a\nproblem. The white catgirl struck a\ncharming pose and said, \"That's right,\nyour majesty the king. I have something\nI want to give you. This is the most\nbeautiful stone we found.\" Sib smiled\ngently, accepted the stone from the\ncatgirl, and replied, \"Thank you.\"\nSuddenly, the stone made a ding sound.\nAn eye appeared in the middle of the\nstone with a line of text. received a\nvine artifact, dark knight cats, I\nstone. Seeing this, Sibbon felt\nsurprised and confused. After giving\nSibbon the gift, the two girls said\ngoodbye to him. Your majesty the king,\nwe'll be heading back now. We've been\ngone for more than 10 minutes. If we\ndon't go back, big brother will be\nworried. He also replied cooly, \"Mim,\nokay, goodbye.\" After the two girls\nleft, he thought to himself, \"Are you\nkidding me? I randomly run into the\nlittle carrots while out for a stroll.\nAnd the stone they casually picked up to\ngive me is actually a divine artifact.\nSibbin narcissistically said, \"Just\nforget about giving me the title of son\nof destiny.\" Junah is truly weak now.\nRui standing beside him was confused.\nSuddenly, a voice called out to Sibbin\nfrom a distance. Human king hearing\nsomeone call him, he turned and replied,\n\"The person who arrived was the master.\nHe walked over and said, \"I'm back.\nYou've waited long. Let's go to your\nterritory now, Sibbon replied. Okay.\nSeeing the master carrying more heavy\nthings than his own body. Sib thought to\nhimself, I kind of understand how the\ndwarves could carry so many king of the\nhill siege cannons across the desert\njust by disassembling them into\ncomponents and relying on the dwarves\nmonstrous strength. Moving these heavy\nmechanisms is easier than playing,\nright? Snapping out of his thoughts,\nSibbon exclaimed, \"That's right. There's\nsomething I need to trouble you with\nright away.\" Hearing this, the master\nasked him back at the kingdom. The\nmaster was forging something for Sibbon.\nAs he forged, he said, \"Watch carefully,\nhuman for a growing clan forging\nmaster.\" That is. After finishing the\nforging, he held up a crown with a\nsparkling red gem in the center. And\ncontinued, \"This is as simple as making\na toy for a child.\" Sibbin standing\nbeside him saw the crown the master made\nand clapped in praise. It's magnificent.\nTo express his gratitude, Sibbon brought\nout wine for the master. Although it's a\ntrivial job for a dwarf master, but this\nis an important item. I need to become\nthe human king. After Sibbon opened the\nwine bottle, he said, \"To express my\nthanks, I'm giving you a gift.\" When\nSibbon opened the wine bottle, its aroma\nseduced the master, making him drool and\nask covetously, \"This scent is.\" Sibbon\nexplained to the master, \"This is the\nfine royal wine of the Winter Empire.\nOnly Winter City has it, and it's rarely\nsold to outsiders. I know dwarves love\nto drink, so I brought a bottle for you\nto enjoy. The master sniffed the wine's\naroma and said, \"By the stone head\nabove, although humans are poor at\nforging, they can brew such fine wine. I\nswear on my honor as a dwarf. No dwarf\ncan refuse the allure of this fine\nwine.\" None. Hearing this, Sibbon\nrejoiced inwardly. This is the effect I\nwanted. If dwarves could refuse this\nkind of fine wine, why would I have\nbothered to dig it out of the national\ntreasury? He immediately made a\nproposal. Therefore, don't you think\nthat dwarves and humans living together\ncan get what they each need? As long as\nyou agree to bring your tribe to work in\nWinter City, I can promise you one\nbottle of wine like this every day.\nPlus, I am the king. I can guarantee\neveryone's wages, and you are free to\ncome and go. When Sibbon told the master\nabout the benefits of working for him,\nhe was deeply shocked and exclaimed,\n\"This is the temptation of a demon.\nDwarves will absolutely not submit to\nhumans.\" The master continued to think\nas he drank, but our tribe needs a safe\nplace to live. This place not only has\nrare or veins, but also a demihuman\nlittle girl who can find or veins in a\nshort time. She can also perfectly fuse\nor veins. This king is very friendly to\ndwarves. He can guarantee wages and fine\nwine. After careful consideration, the\nmaster shook Sibbon's hand deal. As he\nshook hands, he thought to himself,\n\"Damn it, my hand has lost control. The\nbenefits this human king is offering are\njust too much.\" After the master agreed,\nSibbon said joyfully, \"That's great. To\ncelebrate the friendship between our two\nraces, let's open 10 bottles tonight.\"\nHearing this, the master also danced\njoyfully with Sibbon. While dancing, he\nreplied, \"What? So generous. Your\nmajesty the king. From now on, you are\nthe brother of me.\" Groin Sanderson.\nWait a moment. Uh, \"Hick, I'll forge you\na divine artifact.\" Hick. At that time,\nHick, you can go kill God directly,\n\"Hick, do you need the eternal hammer?\"\n\"Hick, it's yours.\" Hearing this, Sib\nsaid awkwardly, \"You should probably\nkeep that.\" Returning to his room, Sib\nlet out a sigh of relief and said, \"The\ndwarf's drinking capacity is truly\nlimitless, but at least I got him to\nagree.\" Suddenly, Sibbon was pulled into\na room by an arm, surprising him. It\nturned out to be Rui who was in that\nroom and pulled him in. He asked,\n\"Surprise Ruer.\" She replied, \"Havey, I\nhave a gift I want to give you.\" Sibbon\nseemed mesmerized, a look of affection\nshining in his eyes. He looked at Ruer\ngently, his voice stuttering as he\nasked. \"A Gift?\" She looked up at him\nseductively and replied. That was all\nSibbin needed to hear. He placed his\nhands on Ruer's shoulders, his eagerness\nand desire so apparent that he was\ndrooling. Then he glanced around\nnervously. Teach, this isn't right.\nSomewhere other than the bedroom. He was\nabout to say more, but stopped himself.\nForget it. Someone might barge into the\nbedroom anyway. It's all the same. One\nof her fingers touched his forehead,\ncausing him to stop looking around and\nbecome calmer. But his eyes still\nsparkled shily as he said, \"Then I'll\naccept.\" Suddenly, Ruer spoke up. The\ncoronation ceremony is tomorrow morning.\nWhat are you thinking about? Then she\nstepped out of his embrace and walked\nforward saying, \"The gift I was talking\nabout is this.\" In front of him, Ruer\nstood beside a magnificent red cloak\nthat exuded nobility. And then she\nintroduced it. I personally sewed this\ncloak. Perhaps it will be of use at\ntomorrow's coronation ceremony. The\nscene shifted to a vast sky dotted with\nsmall colorful pieces of paper\naccompanied by the sound of trumpets\nmaking the atmosphere here incredibly\nlively. The voice of the announcer began\nthe introduction. It stretches from the\nSerundo mountains in the south to the\ncold not land region in the north.\nBordering the Andor Empire and the\nMetton Duchy to the east and west. It\nhas formed the nation where we stand,\nthis lush and fertile land. The subjects\ngathered here stood parted on two sides,\ndiscussing animatedly among themselves.\nThey all faced the path in the middle\nand shouted, \"You're mysti.\" The opening\nwords began, \"Today this country will\nwelcome its new master.\" At the same\ntime, a procession appeared from the\nsky. In the middle was a carriage pulled\nby three flying beasts with guard behind\nit. Seeing this, the people here cheered\njoyfully in welcome. The announcer's\nvoice introduced the leader that is our\none and only leader, his majesty Havy\nGolden Lion. Sib stood tall and landed\namidst a cloud of smoke, accompanied by\nresounding cheers, His Majesty Hav. He\nstepped down from the carriage. Grimman\ndrew his sword and commanded, \"Cusader\nLegion, attention.\" On both sides,\nsoldiers stood in two neat rows, drew\ntheir swords, pointed them to the sky,\nand shouted in unison, \"Hail the king,\npresent for his majesty the king.\" then\nfollowed a chorus of welcomes. The\nentire Tfong Legion expresses its\nhighest respect to your highness. City\nguard, we salute you. Cavalry division,\nwe salute you. The unison shouts ended\nas Sibbon stepped onto the stage. He\nintroduced himself. I heavy golden lion\nswear to all the people of the kingdom.\nSibbon turned to the crowd joyfully\nspreading his arms wide and said\nmajestically, \"I will rule a nation more\npowerful than any in history.\" Everyone\nwill witness a new nation rise from here\nand will be proud to be a citizen of\nthis place to protect it, to develop it,\nto explore it, and will plant its flag\nall over the king continent. Then he\nannounced the name of this nation. It is\ncalled the winter empire. Then he added,\n\"And I am called the winter king.\" The\npeople below cheered joyfully, raising\nboth hands high and shouting in unison,\n\"Long live the winter king. Long live,\nlong live.\" Along with that, the sound\nof a bell signaling a new beginning also\nrang out. As the bell rang, it was also\nthe moment Rui, Lori, and the children\nstepped forward. The two girls walked\nahead carrying a crown and a cloak. It\nrepresented the royal robe. Following\nthem were children holding wine glasses,\nlaughing happily as they followed in the\ntwo's footsteps. They stepped onto the\nplatform and said in unison, \"Long live\nyour majesty the king. Please accept our\nblessings.\" Seeing this, Sibbon knelt\ndown, placing his hand on his chest\nsolemnly. Rueer came and draped the\nsparkling noble red cloak over him. The\npeople behind cheered, \"Long live your\nmajesty.\" Then Lorie stepped forward,\nsmiling brightly as she held up the\ngolden crown and said gently, \"Long live\nyour majesty.\" The cheers continued to\nring out one after another, \"Your\nmajesty.\" Amidst that joyful celebratory\natmosphere, a notification sound\nsuddenly rang out. Ding. That ding sound\nmade Sibbon, who was holding the crown,\nfreeze. After that came the\nannouncement, system update successful.\nThe host death ending has been changed.\nBeep beep. A new child of destiny has\ndescended. The new announcement with its\nfinal words left a big question in\nSibbon's mind. A new child of destiny.\nSo, the villainous lord, the player, and\nthe main character all want to kill me.\nThe story ends here."

      "transcript": "The man woke up in a huge bed of 600\nsquare meters and looked at the crystal\nchandelier on the ceiling. He frowned\nslightly. The bed was filled with top\ncelebrities, models, school beauties,\nand other beauties. Faced with such a\nstunning beauty, the man remained\nunmoved. After all, he had 11 women like\nher. Sumu glanced around and finally\nfixed his gaze on a pure and beautiful\nschool beauty and gently pushed her\naway. Bang! The school beauty was pushed\nonto the bed and rolled over twice. When\nshe woke up, she was completely\nbewildered. Sumu ignored her and picked\nup the book she had been lying on. The\nbook was titled Practical Tutorial on\nClinical Hypnosis. Turning to page 128,\nSumu read carefully, How to Use Voice,\nProps, and Gestures for Hypnotic\nSuggestion. At this moment, the other\nbeauties woke up and began to playfully\ntease each other. Honey, stop reading.\nAre we more interesting than books? As\nsoon as he finished speaking, the other\nwomen joined in the laughter. Sumu's\nexpression darkened and he snapped his\nfingers lightly. The next second, the 12\nbeauties vanished, leaving only Sumu. 2\nhours later, Sumu tossed the book aside.\nHe lay back heavily on the bed, his thin\nbody enveloped by the mattress, and the\nweariness in his eyes intensified. \"This\nkind of life is so boring,\" he sighed.\n\"Am I just going to die in this\nboredom?\" A moment later, Sumu stood by\nthe bright floor toseeiling window. He\nlooked down at the bustling city. I\ncasually picked up the remote and\npointed it at the TV. Beep. The next\nmoment, the sky outside instantly became\nblazing bright, as if the sun had fallen\nto earth. The explosion resounded\nthrough the heavens and the earth. The\nbustling city was instantly destroyed. A\nmushroom cloud rose slowly, and white\nlight engulfed everything. Sumu quietly\nadmired the scene. Even after seeing it\ncountless times, it is still so pleasing\nto the eye. Immediately, the white light\nengulfed the skyscraper he was in. Sumu\nwoke up on a large bed that was 1 m wide\nand 2 m long, surrounded by an old\nwardrobe and a wooden table filled with\nbooks. The dream ended. Everything that\nhad just happened was Su Mu's dream. In\nhis dream, he could create worlds at\nwill. Whether it's a modern city or a\nwestern world of swords and magic,\nanything you can imagine can be created.\nHe wants beautiful women, school\nbeauties, celebrities, fairies, elves.\nHe can choose any of them. He wants\npower. He can be the speaker of the\nfederal parliament, an ancient emperor,\nor the heavenly emperor of the celestial\nrealm. A year ago, Sumu, who had just\nstarted dreaming, was just an ordinary\nstudent and an orphan. But the\nstimulation in his dreams brought him\nendless pleasure. In his dreams, he can\nunleash all his desires. He can also\ncontrol the flow of time within his\ndreams, extending it by up to a year.\nHowever, after enjoying a century of\nhappiness, Sumu began to find it boring.\nHe discovered that the people in his\ndreams were entirely his own creations.\nNothing unexpected happened in his\ndream. He knew everyone's actions and\nwords. So, he began to pursue adventure\nand killing. At the same time, Sumu\nfound that his body was becoming weak\nand he often had headaches and\nnosebleleeds, but his mind was unusually\nclear. One day, he suddenly developed a\nsplitting headache and eventually\ncollapsed. After a hospital examination,\nthe doctor said it was due to a lack of\nexercise. However, his body grew weaker\nand his headaches worsened. He could\nclearly feel his life slipping away.\nThis feeling of being unable to control\nthings excited him. This is wonderful.\nSumu got up and sat at his desk, blood\ndripping from his nose and splattering\nonto the white paper. He picked up his\npen and wrote rapidly. 7 days. I have 7\ndays left to live. Waking up for the\n368th time, my mental strength has\nincreased once again. He continued\nwriting, \"Dreams have the property of\nrestoring and enhancing mental energy.\nEven if mental energy is completely\ndepleted, a dream can replenish and\nincrease it by 1%.\" Sumu flipped through\nhis previous dream summaries. The first\none, he always dreams after falling\nasleep and his mental strength increases\nafter waking up. If you don't want to\nincrease your mental energy, you can\navoid it by not sleeping. Secondly,\nstimulating activities and dreams can\neffectively deplete mental energy.\nArticle three, the physical body is like\na container and mental energy is like\nwater. Exceeding the limits of the\nphysical body can lead to symptoms such\nas headaches, tonitis, and nose bleeds.\nHe closed his notebook realizing he was\nsuffering from a disease where his\nmental strength was constantly\nincreasing while his body was already\nbeyond its limits. He would die in 7\ndays. The treatment is to increase\nphysical strength. Currently, he can\nonly relieve physical stress by\nexpending mental energy. At that moment,\nhis headache began to worsen again. Just\nthen, a black sedan pulled up in front\nof the dilapidated apartment building.\nTwo men in black suits stepped out of\nthe car, and the snake tattoos on their\nnecks drew the attention of those around\nthem. The Viper Gang, the most\nterrifying gang in District 13. The two\nmen took out a wheelchair and went\ndirectly into the building. The\nsurrounding pedestrians breathed a sigh\nof relief. What are the Viper gang doing\nhere? Did they borrow money from lone\nsharks and they're here to collect the\ndebt? Shortly after, the door to Sumu's\nhouse was pushed open and two men in\nsuits pushed a wheelchair in. They\nscanned the room and finally headed\ntowards the bedroom. Sumu's headache\neased slightly. He turned around and saw\ntwo menacing looking men standing at the\ndoor. \"Boss,\" the two called out in\nunison. Sumu frowned. \"How many times\nhave I told you? Don't call me boss. Use\nmy title.\" The two quickly corrected\nthemselves. Yes, leader. Sumu nodded and\nput on his brown tinted glasses. He\nstood up to leave, but suddenly felt\ndizzy and fell back into his chair. Two\nmen quickly came forward, helped him\ninto a wheelchair, and lifted him into a\ncar to leave. The headquarters of the\nViper gang. Sumu sat in a wheelchair\nwith a huge wall behind him covered with\nintricate Urao&lt;unk&gt;'s patterns. Before\nhim stood over a hundred men in black\nsuits, filling the entire hall who\nshouted in unison, \"Leader!\" Sumu nodded\ncalmly and began today's hypnosis\nsession. He taught himself hypnosis, and\nwith his powerful mental strength, Sumu\nbrought it to its fullest potential. The\nViper Gang is the largest and most\nruthless gang in the 13th district of\nStar City. But in front of Sumu, they\nare as submissive as dogs. Sumu took out\na dark gold pocket watch from his\npocket. The pattern on the pocket watch\nmatched the Urabor's pattern on the\nwall. Everyone focus your attention on\nthe pocket watch. His voice was deep and\nmagnetic. As the pocket watch swung,\neveryone's eyes were unconsciously drawn\nto it, and the patterned wall behind\nSumu became one with him. He revealed\nhis deep set eyes. Waves of spiritual\nenergy emanated from them like invisible\nsnakes burrowing into everyone's mental\nworld. Under the influence of this\nfluctuation, the members of the Viper\ngang knelt down and bowed to Sumu. Long\nlive the leader. Sumu's hypnosis\ntechnique is not complicated, but\nbecause he can use his powerful mental\nstrength, the effect is far superior to\nthat of ordinary hypnotists. The\nprinciple of hypnosis is to attract\nattention and take the opportunity to\nenter the other person's inner world,\nthereby exerting control. Few, Sumu let\nout a soft breath. The mental energy he\nhad used up made him feel much better\nand he successfully stood up from his\nwheelchair. He raised his hand and the\nshouts instantly ceased. All the fervent\neyes of the crowd focused on him,\nawaiting the divine instruction. That\nperson stays. Everyone else disperse.\nSumu commanded calmly. The crowd\ndispersed, leaving only a burly, bald\nman with a scarred face and triangular\neyes. This man's name was Xiao Xiao Yao,\nthe second in command of the Viper gang,\nresponsible for daily affairs. Leader\nXiao Xiaoa bowed respectfully. Any news\nabout what I instructed you to do? Sumu\nasked, reporting to the leader. The two\nmen I sent to keep an eye on Yong Doning\nhave lost contact. The bodies of the two\nmen were found yesterday in a garbage\ndump near Yaong Donging&lt;unk&gt;s home, Ziao\nChaya reported. What was the cause of\ndeath? Ziao Xiao took a deep breath. His\nskull had been smashed open by a blunt\nobject and he suffered multiple\nfractures throughout his body. Based on\nthe evidence at the scene, it was almost\ncertain that Yong Donging was\nresponsible. However, but what? Sumu's\nlips curled slightly. Their deaths were\nstrange. It seemed they were beaten to\ndeath with blunt steel weapons, yet\nthere were fist marks on their bones.\nCould it be that Yong Dong killed them\nwhile wearing iron fist gloves? Sumu\neyes gleamed with a sinister light.\nFinally found them. Xiao Xiao Yao was\nstartled. You mean Yong Donging is a\nsuperhuman? His expression became\nuneasy. If Sumu is a superhum, why can't\nYong Doning be one? Sumu turned around,\npicked up the crystal wine bottle on the\ntable, and poured the crimson wine into\na stemmed glass. Continue, he said,\nswirling his wine glass. Xiao Xiao\nquickly changed the subject. Chief,\nshould we continue to keep an eye on\nYong Doning? No need. The surveillance\nwas just to confirm if he was\nextraordinary, an ordinary student,\nsmashing the heads of two Viper gang\nmembers with his bare hands. So, what's\nthe next step? Sumu raised his wine\nglass and drank it all in one gulp,\nhunting for the extraordinary. A black\nsedan drove through the dilapitated\nstreet, flanked by low-rise houses with\nblack smoke billowing in the air.\nOccasionally, women dressed in brightly\ncolored dresses would stand outside the\nhouses. Their vibrant colors contrasting\nsharply with the surrounding gloom. Sumu\nlooked out the window. Could he be\nconsidered an extraordinary person?\nBefore taking control of the Viper gang,\nhe didn't even know that such people\nexisted in the world. In Shingqing, the\nurban areas are clearly divided. The\nupper urban area is where nobles and the\nwealthy live, while the lower urban area\nis where workers and gangsters gather.\nSuperhumans may not be considered\nmysterious in the upper city, but in the\nlower city, they are untouchable beings.\nSumu learned from the Viper Gangs\nintelligence that extraordinary\nindividuals possess power unimaginable\nto ordinary people. This power is called\nextraordinary. He didn't know how he\nbecame a superhuman, nor did he\nunderstand the source of superhuman\npower, but that didn't stop him from\nhunting Yong Doning. His health\ndeteriorated, but Yong Doning&lt;unk&gt;s\nappearance gave him hope. Her physical\ncondition gave him a glimmer of hope for\nsurvival. Half an hour later, the car\nstopped in front of a school. The\nsignboard at the school gate was eroded\nby wind and rain, and the words were\nblurred. Sumu stepped out of the luxury\ncar Thunder600,\nattracting the attention of many\nstudents. Whose car is that? A\nThunderX600. So luxurious, someone\nwhispered. It's Sumu, the young master\nof class 2, grade three, someone said\nsourly. Sumu, leaning on a snake-\npatterned wooden cane, slowly walked\ninto the schoolgate. On the golden dial\nat the top of the cane, the pattern of\nthe Ura Boros was faintly visible. Tall\nand slender with pale skin and deep eyes\nbehind brown tinted glasses, he exuded\nan air of mystery. Some girls at school\nwho admired him secretly spread rumors\nthat he was a fallen nobleman whose\nancestors were nobles. However, the cane\nwas not for show. It was because of his\nphysical condition which made using\ncrutches a necessity. As he approached\nthe teaching building, a petite girl\nnamed Jang Yu, wearing a dark blue\ndress, jogged over and stopped abruptly\nin front of him. Her cheeks were flushed\nand she held a pink letter in her hand.\nZumu. Jang Yu lowered her head, her eyes\ndarting away. Upon seeing Jang Yu, the\nsurrounding students all turned their\nattention to her and began to whisper\namong themselves, \"This is Jang Yu, the\nclass beauty of class 2, grade 3. Is she\nholding a love letter? Is she going to\nconfess her feelings to Sumu?\" Jang Yu\nblushed and stood in front of Sumu,\nmustering her courage to ask, \"Sumu, are\nyou feeling better?\" \"Much better. Thank\nyou for your concern.\" Sumu replied with\na smile, his gentle voice making Jang Yu\nblush even more. That's good, Jang Yu\nsaid, clutching the letter tightly. Sumu\nsmiled and pointed to the letter. Is\nthis for me? Jang Yu finally mustered\nthe courage to look up. But upon seeing\nSu Mu&lt;unk&gt;s gentle smile, her courage\nvanished instantly and she lowered her\nhead. Finally, Jan Yu raised her hand\nand handed the letter to Sumu. Sumu, I\nlike you. As she looked down, she saw\nthe golden dial at the top of the cane\nwhere the Urao&lt;unk&gt;'s pattern seemed to\ncome alive, slowly invading her mental\nworld. Jang Yu&lt;unk&gt;s shyness vanished\ninstantly as if she were being\ncontrolled. Later, Yang Doning will be\nat the school in 10 minutes. Her voice\nreturned to normal, back to its previous\ntense tone. Sumu smiled and nodded. \"I\nunderstand.\" Jang Yu looked up, her\ntears suddenly stopping. \"I think you're\nright. Then go and study,\" Sumu said\ncalmly. Jang Yu pursed her lips, wiped\naway the tears from the corners of her\neyes, and turned away as if nothing had\nhappened. Her friends quickly surrounded\nher. \"How was it? Did you succeed? Did\nyou make it?\" Jang Yu smiled bitterly.\n\"No, I failed.\" Her words stunned her\nsisters. Sumu walked into the teaching\nbuilding when suddenly a boy rushed in\nfront of him and blocked his way.\n\"Leader, Yong Donging is in the\nrestroom,\" the boy said in a low voice,\nhis words so fast they were almost\ninaudible. The girls followed closely\nbehind. However, when they passed Sumu,\nthey instantly became indifferent, like\npuppets being manipulated. Later, Chihao\nand his gang are extorting Yong Donging\nin the restroom,\" the girl said in a low\nvoice, her tone cold before returning to\nnormal. Sumu remained calm. Instead of\nreturning to the classroom, he headed\ntowards the restroom. A few wisps of\nsmoke hung in the air outside the\ntoilet, mixed with muffled groans and\nscreams. Sumu used his cane to lift the\ncurtain and entered. Just then, a boy\ncame out of the restroom. He was\nexpressionless, and there were several\ndark red streaks of blood on his fist.\nSeeing that Sumu did not speak, but only\nfrowned slightly with a warning in his\neyes, the boy then walked away with his\nhead held high. Sumu ignored him and\nwent straight to the toilet stall. He\npushed open the door with his cane and\nsaw three blond-haired boys lying\nhalf-hazardly next to the toilet bowl,\ngroaning in pain. Sumu tapped his cane\nlightly. A mental wave spread and the\nthree blond-haired men's eyes\nmomentarily went blank before regaining\ntheir seriousness. The leader of the\nthree, Chihao, began to explain. We\nextorted money from Yong Doning as\nusual, but this time he refused and even\nbeat us up. Sumu nodded. What are you\nplanning to do next? I told him not to\nleave after school and he agreed. I\nfound an older brother and we're going\nto beat him up after school. Sumu\nsmiled, said nothing, and turned to\nleave. Soon after, another groan echoed\nfrom the toilet. Inside the classroom,\nSumu sat in the last row, staring\nblankly out the window. Everything in\nthe classroom seemed so ordinary. Yong\nDonging was Sumu&lt;unk&gt;s classmate. He was\noften bullied and even extorted. At this\nmoment, Yong Donging was writing\nsomething with his head down. Suddenly,\nYong Dong&lt;unk&gt;s expression changed, and\nshe instinctively clutched her chest.\nTeacher Wong, I need to go to the\nrestroom. Teacher Wong glanced at him\nindifferently and said, \"Go.\" Yang\nDonging erased the words on his\nnotebook, got up, and left the\nclassroom. As his footsteps faded into\nthe distance, the atmosphere in the\nclassroom suddenly changed. The entire\nclassroom fell into a deathly silence.\nAll the students turned their heads at\nonce, their eyes fixed on Sumu in the\nlast row. \"Later,\" Sumu turned his gaze\naway from the window and stared coldly\nat them. \"What did he write?\" he asked\nin a low voice. Yong Dong&lt;unk&gt;s deskmate\nand the student behind him answered at\nthe same time. Dream, nightmare. Why\nwould Yong Donging write down these two\nwords? It's not unusual for teenagers to\nwrite strange things, but Yong Donging,\nas an extraordinary individual, is\ncertainly not simple. Sumu had a vague\nidea. Could it be that Yong Donging also\ngained his abilities through dreams? If\nso, was he also a superhuman? No. Yong\nDonging didn't sleep during class. He\nremembered that when he could control\nhis dreams, what he wanted most was to\nsleep. Interesting. Sumu smiled. He\ntapped his cane lightly on the ground,\nand the classroom returned to its noisy\nstate. Students, turned to page 138.\nTeacher Wong&lt;unk&gt;s voice rang out again,\nand the students returned to their\nprevious state. Sumu's thoughts drifted\naway once more. He had already\nhypnotized everyone in the school,\nincluding the security guard's dog. In\norder to exhaust his ever-growing mental\nenergy, he would not let any target slip\nby. That's why he noticed Yong\nDoning&lt;unk&gt;s unusual behavior. Half a\nmonth ago, Yong Doning suddenly broke\nfree from Sumu&lt;unk&gt;s hypnosis. At that\ntime, Yong Doning had missed a week of\nclass. Sumu wanted to intensify the\nhypnosis, so he casually shook the\nUrubo&lt;unk&gt;'s pattern on his cane, but\nYong Donging showed no reaction. When\nthe school bell rang, Yong Doning left\nthe classroom with a heavy expression.\nEver since he went to the toilet during\nthe first class, he had been in a bad\nmood. When he arrived at the school\ngate, Chihao, who had been waiting\nthere, surrounded him with dozens of his\nbrothers and pulled him away. Sumu got\ninto the car and left. Soon, the luxury\ncar stopped in front of a residential\nbuilding, and Xiao Xiao Yao took Sumu to\nthe top floor. The room was empty except\nfor a chair and a pair of binoculars.\nTwo burly gangsters and a pretty young\ngirl stood to one side. Ignoring\neveryone, Sumu sat down and Xiao Xiao\nhanded him the binoculars. Lower them.\nSumu instructed casually. Xiao Xia Yao\nquickly adjusted the position of the\nbinoculars and Sumu looked towards where\nChihao and Yong Doning were. Hao pointed\narrogantly at Yong Donging with dozens\nof people behind him holding baseball\nbats. Yong Donging, now that your big\nbrother is here, do you still dare to be\narrogant? Chihao shouted. Yong Donging\nshowed no fear, but his brows were\nfurrowed. Don't frighten your\nclassmates. A man with a cigarette in\nhis mouth patted Hao on the shoulder.\nBrother, this is the kid who hit me,\"\nChua said excitedly. The man smiled and\nnodded, then walked up to Yong Doning.\nThe man didn't look directly at Yong\nDoning, but patted him on the shoulder.\n\"You must be Yong Doning. Take your hand\naway,\" Yong Doning said coldly. The\nman's smile instantly turned sinister.\n\"Too much youthful arrogance is no\ngood.\" Before he could finish speaking,\nYong Doning grabbed his wrist and\ntwisted it sharply. The man fell to his\nknees in pain. \"What are you all\nstanding there for?\" \"Kill him!\" Chuhao\nshouted. Then the crowd rushed towards\nYong Doning. He charged into the crowd,\nrampaging like a tank, punching and\nkilling, blood splattering everywhere.\nThe stick struck him with a metallic\nclanging sound, but failed to harm him\nin the slightest. Sumu withdrew his gaze\nand turned to look at the girl inside\nthe room. She stood ramrod straight. Is\nthis the person you found? Sumu asked.\nBoss, her name is Jasmine. She's the top\ncordisan at the brothel. Ziao Xiao\nurged. Jasmine immediately smiled\nsweetly. Hello, boss. Sumu frowned\nslightly. Put away your worldly air. I\nwant a pure, innocent girl who hasn't\nexperienced the ways of the world. Ziao\nXiao quickly explained. Chief, I was\njust following your instructions. Sumu\nglanced at him coldly. Is that my\nproblem? Ziao Xiao immediately knelt\ndown. cold sweat pouring down his face.\nThis subordinate wouldn't dare. Jasmine,\ndo you know about the mission? Jasmine\nlowered her head. I'm just playing a\nstudent. I haven't really gone to\nschool. It's all arranged by the club.\nXiao Xiao Yao glared at Jasmine. You\nsumu sighed softly. Forget it. You're\nall muscle and brains. You wouldn't\nunderstand my instructions. He turned to\nJasmine. Do you know the mission?\nJasmine nodded. Yes. To gain Yong\nDong&lt;unk&gt;s trust and make him fall in\nlove with me. Sumu became interested.\nTell me about it. Jasmine recounted. I\nused to be a good girl who dropped out\nof school to work. My father was\naddicted to gambling. My mother was sick\nand my younger brother was in school.\nSumu smiled. The script is fine, but you\nneed to change your demeanor. Got it.\nJasmine took a deep breath and closed\nher eyes. When she opened her eyes\nagain, she seemed like a different\nperson. Her eyes were resolute, full of\nstruggle and vitality. Not bad. Sumu\nnodded in satisfaction. Jasmine beamed\nwith joy, a flattering smile appearing\non her face. Sumu frowned. Keep her in\nshape. Take her to rehearsal. Yes,\nleader. Xiao Xiao Yao immediately took\nJasmine to rehearsal. At night, Yong\nDonging, dressed in black, wearing a\nbaseball cap and a mask, quietly went\nout. Chao had caused him trouble twice\nduring the day, crossing his bottom\nline. Power. I need more power so I can\nsurvive in this hell. He pulled up his\nhood to hide his face, strode out of the\nhouse, and moved swiftly through the\nnight like a ghost. As he walked into a\nsecluded alley, he heard a girl's cries\nfor help coming from afar. Help! Please\nlet me go, you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Weren't you acting\nall high and mighty just now? Yong\nDoning shook his head coldly. You reap\nwhat you sow. However, his next words\nmade him change his mind. Hey, bro. This\nchick's got some hotties. Could she be a\nstudent? He he, I'm in luck today. The\nmoonlight shone down, revealing two\nsleazy looking men harassing a girl in a\ncheap dress. Just then, Yong Doning\nsuddenly appeared in front of them.\nStop. Let go of that girl. He rushed\nforward, his movements swift as the\nwind. With two loud bangs, the two men\nwere sent flying like kites with broken\nstrings, crashing into the wall. Who\ndares to ruin my good time? A man roared\nas he stood up, only to be kicked away\nagain by Yong Donging, spitting out\nblood. Get lost. Yong Donging shouted\ncoldly, realizing the others strength,\nthe two quickly fled. The girl seemed\nextremely frightened, collapsing to the\nground and sobbing softly. \"Are you all\nright?\" Yong Doning asked as he stepped\nforward. The girl trembled slightly, and\nwhen she looked up, Yong Doning was\nstunned. The girl shrank back and hurly\npicked up the fallen shoulder strap.\n\"Thank you for saving me.\" She struggled\nto her feet, but seemed to be injured.\nYong Donging instinctively reached out\nto help her, but the girl quickly dodged\naway. Don't misunderstand. I'm different\nfrom them. I won't hurt you. The girl's\ngaze remained wary. Thank you. What's\nyour name? I'll definitely repay you in\nthe future, said Yong Doning. Yong\nDoning answered without hesitation.\nHolly, the girl smiled slightly. If I\nremember correctly, Holly is a flower\nand its flower language is life\nsymbolizing perseverance. Yong Donging\nwas taken aback. Then I have to go back.\nI'll see you off, Yong Dona blurted out.\nThere was a hint of weariness in the\ngirl's eyes. No need. I can go back by\nmyself. Yong Doning felt a little\ndisappointed. Suddenly, the girl\nstumbled and fell to the ground. Yong\nDoning quickly stepped forward and\ncaught her soft body. Can you let go of\nme now? The girl's soft voice broke his\ngaze. Yong Donging quickly released her,\nhis face slightly flushed. Thank you.\nThe girl thanked her again and prepared\nto leave. At this moment, Yong Doning\nnoticed that her ankle was red and\nswollen. Your foot is injured. Let me\ntake you. The girl refused without\nturning around. I can manage myself. Ah.\nShe lost her balance again and fell to\nthe ground. Yong Doning quickly caught\nher. Don't be stubborn. I'll take you,\nhe said firmly. The girl lowered her\nhead slightly and responded softly.\nUnder the moonlight, Yong Doning held\nthe girl. Nanimo my name. Yong Donging\nwas slightly taken aback and repeated,\n\"Nammo?\" He thought the name sounded\nvery beautiful. \"Is there a story behind\nit?\" Yong Donging asked. Nanimo was a\nlittle surprised. \"Everyone calls me\nJasmine. I think it's beautiful.\" Nan Mo\nsmiled, and the weariness in her eyes\ngradually disappeared. The banana leaves\nhang heavy with fruit in the small\ngarden, and the jasmine in the southern\nland outshines a thousand flowers. What?\nYong Donging was stunned. The story\nbehind my name, NMO said gently. Is that\nso? Yong Doning smiled. In the distance,\nSumu put down his night vision\nbinoculars, a smile appearing on his\nlips. Nemo, Jasmine. Reality is indeed\nmore interesting than dreams. Even\ninsignificant people have their shining\npoints. He observed quietly, witnessing\nJasmine's impressive performance\nfirsthand, even reading her lines\nclearly. Sumu can read lips without any\ndifficulty. He has been learning in his\ndreams and has mastered many interesting\nskills. Go investigate Nanimo. She\ndoesn't seem as simple as she appears.\nSumu casually handed the night vision\nbinoculars to Xiao Xiao. Yes, sir. The\nnext day at the headquarters of the\nViper gang. Sumu sat in a wheelchair,\nhis face pale. His condition is getting\nworse. Chief Jasmine is here. Xiao Xiao\nYao led Nanmo in and Nano nervously\nlooked around. How's it going? Sumu\nasked from the high platform. Nanimo\nquickly replied. Yong Dongqing hasn't\nsuspected anything. Sumu nodded, looking\nher over. Are you asleep? Nanimo\nstiffened slightly. No, he knew I was\ninjured and didn't touch me. I told him\nI was scared and asked him not to leave.\nHe slept on the floor and later I let\nhim get into bed. Sumu's gaze swept to\nher ankle. The injury was clearly real.\nWell done. Men don't cherish things that\nare too easily obtained. Nimo was\nslightly pleased. Thank you for the\ncompliment. Yong Donging is very\ninnocent. Sumu shook his head, his smile\ncarrying a hint of amusement. You acted\nso realistically, it's as if you didn't\neven realize you were acting. Nenmo gave\na stiff smile. People like us deal with\nall sorts of guests everyday, so we know\na thing or two about acting. You don't\nneed to be modest. Your acting skills\nhave nothing to do with your profession.\nNan Mo&lt;unk&gt;s face stiffened. Boss, what\ndo you mean by that? It's nothing. I\nchecked your background. a gambling\nfather, a sick mother, a younger brother\nin school. You used to be a student, and\nyou like poetry and music. The only\ndifference is that reality is cruer than\nthe script, and you are stronger than\nthe characters in the script. Naanimo\nremains silent, a hint of desolation in\nher eyes. The characters in the script\nalso have parents, but my father died\nfrom debt collection, my mother died\nfrom illness, and my younger brother cut\noff contact with me because of my job.\nShe lowered her head. Stop. Sumu\ninterrupted. I know your past better\nthan you do yourself. Namo realized that\nthe man in front of her was the leader\nof the Viper gang, a man without\ncompassion. Your brother works at\nChingshin Machinery Factory now, right?\nNan Mo hurly replied. Don't hurt my\nbrother. I'll do whatever you say. Stop.\nSumu frowned. Why would I harm your\nbrother? Nan Mo froze, then answered\nblankly. Yes, I'll pay. You do the work\nfor me. Simple and clear. Understand?\nUnderstood? Then the Chingshi machinery\nfactory is poorly managed and owes money\nto the poisonous snake gang. The factory\nmanager plans to mortgage the factory to\nthe poisonous snake gang. Since your\nbrother happens to be there, I'm\nplanning to exchange your deserve\ncompensation for Chungshi Machinery\nfactory and make your brother the\nfactory manager. If your brother becomes\nthe factory manager, we don't need to\ninvest a single penny or send anyone to\nmanage it. Isn't that a win-win\nsituation? Nimo was filled with doubts.\nIf she did the task well, her younger\nbrother would become the factory\nmanager. If she did it poorly, the\nmachinery factory would become a\ngraveyard. She finally agreed. I do.\nVery good. Next, I have a second task\nfor you. But before that, let's talk\nabout what's special about Yong Doning.\nNaanimo said, \"His whole body is very\nhard. His skin is like steel.\" Sumu\nnarrowed his eyes slightly, thinking to\nhimself, \"Steel like skin? Is this the\nability of a superhuman or Yong\nDongqing&lt;unk&gt;s own special ability? He\nthen told Nanmo about his subsequent\nplans. Nanimo looked worried. Are you\nplanning to kill him? Sumu smiled\nfaintly. No, I just want to ask him a\nfew questions. Is it really necessary to\nask so many questions? Nanimo remained\nworried. You're talking too much. Sumu's\nvoice turned cold. Nanimo felt a chill\nrun down her spine as she looked up and\nsaw the eyes hidden behind the brown\ntinted glasses. She lowered her head and\nimmediately took her leave. At night,\nYong Doning stood in the dilapitated\nbungalow, staring intently at Nanmo in\nthe kitchen. Wearing an apron, she\nbusied herself in the cramped space.\nYong Doning, who had been facing life or\ndeath threats for a long time, felt a\nsense of relief. Dinner's ready. Nano\nsmiled as she brought out two plates of\nfood, her fair arm waving in front of\nhim, the aroma of the dishes filling the\nair. Hey, come and try my cooking. I've\nput all my skills to use today. Nanimo\nsmiled and waved her hand. Yong Donging\nsnapped out of his days, picked up his\nchopsticks, and began to eat. It was his\nfirst time eating with a beautiful\nwoman. He ate his meal with great\nsatisfaction. Are you full? Yes, I'm\nfull. Nan Mo smiled, her eyes curving\ninto crescent. I'm fine now. I'm going\nto work. The door closed, and Nan Mo\ndisappeared into the night. Silence\nremained in the room. Young Doning\nclenched his fist. Molly, I'll take care\nof you. He used to be unable to support\nhimself, but now as a superhuman, wealth\nis readily available to him. He\nimmediately went out, ready to make\nmoney. His method was simple. Rob the\nrich to help the poor, taking the wealth\nof others to alleviate his own poverty.\nNot long after, Yong Doning returned to\nMoonlight Bar with more than 50,000\nyuan. \"I've made quite a bit of money,\nenough to live a good life for a while,\"\nhe thought, adding that he should also\nbuy Jasmine a new dress. However, when\nYong Doning arrived at the bar, he was\nshocked to find that the door had been\nsmashed. He rushed into the bar where\nbroken glass and spilled drinks were\neverywhere. The waiters were all injured\nand the bar owner was sighing. Yong\nDonging anxiously searched for Nanmo,\nbut couldn't find her. He roared,\n\"Where's Moly?\" No one dared to answer.\nHe suddenly grabbed a waiter and\ndemanded, \"Where is Jasmine?\" \"She's\nbeen arrested,\" the waiter said,\ntrembling. Yong Donging was furious. Who\narrested her? Two customers with\nbandages led a group of people and\nsmashed up the bar, saying that someone\nsaved you last time, and now let's see\nwho can save you this time. Yang Doning\nsuddenly realized that these were the\nsame two guys who had threatened Nano\nlast time. He regretted not dealing with\nthem directly back then. Where did they\ngo? I don't know. The waiter was so\nfrightened he almost cried. The bar\nowner chimed in, \"The Viper Gang. They\nhave black snake tattoos on their\nbodies. They're from the Viper Gang.\"\nYong Donging released his grip and the\nwaiter collapsed to the ground, rushing\nout without looking back. In the\nmonitoring room, Sumu held up a glass of\nred wine and asked, \"Is it good?\" Nanimo\ncarefully tasted it. \"It's delicious.\nI've never had such an expensive wine\nbefore.\" Nano replied. Sumu smiled. I\ndon't like hearing lies. Nanimo paused\nfor a moment. \"Actually, it's not that\ngood. It's a little astringent.\" \"That's\nright. I also think it doesn't taste\ngood. Here, try the steak.\" Sumu pointed\nto the M9 steak on the table. Naanimo\nnodded, cut off a piece, and put it in\nher mouth. The taste was fresh and\njuicy, far surpassing any food she had\never eaten, except for snacks. She took\na bite, and then stopped because Sumu\nhadn't touched his chopsticks. It's all\nright, eat. Yong Donging will need some\ntime to save you. When Yong Donging was\nmentioned, Nanmo fell silent for a\nmoment. She ate her steak, but her\nfeelings were complicated. You really\nwon't kill him? She asked. Sumu narrowed\nhis eyes. You've developed feelings so\nquickly. Naanimo shook her head. No,\nhe's a good person. I'm not good enough\nfor him. I'm just afraid. What if he\ndies for me? Don't worry. I'm not a bad\nperson. Sumu smiled. Chad GPT says,\n\"Chapter 11. What an unparalleled honor\nit is to die for the leader.\" Halfway\nthrough the stake, a scream suddenly\ncame from the surveillance footage.\nNanimo put down her knife and fork,\nturned around, and saw Yong Donging rush\ninto the corridor of the Viper Gang\nheadquarters, where a man in black\nbrandished his knife to meet him. When\nthe first man in black swung his sword\nat Yong Doning, Nmo instinctively\ncovered her eyes. But then she heard a\nclang and the steel blade stopped right\nabove Yong Doning&lt;unk&gt;s head, leaving\nhim unharmed. \"This, how is this\npossible?\" she exclaimed in shock. A\nglint flashed in Sumu&lt;unk&gt;s eyes. This\nis exactly the power I need. Yong\nDoning, expressionless, brought his\nsword down with a sudden chop,\nshattering the steel blade in two. The\nmembers of the Viper gang, instead of\nretreating, advanced. They had been\nhypnotized and brainwashed, showing no\nfear. Try different angles and look for\nweaknesses, Sumu instructed. The men in\nblack began slashing at Yong Donging\nfrom all angles, but he charged like a\ntank, knocking them off their feet and\nleaving them bleeding profusely. Yong\nDong&lt;unk&gt;s fists were as hard as steel,\neasily shattering his enemy. Although he\nhad the upper hand, a chill ran through\nhim. A wounded man in black got up\nagain, shouting with fanaticism for the\nleader. Yang Doning couldn't understand\nwhy these people were so fanatical. Even\nthough they were clearly going to die,\nhe continued his work, clearing the\ncorridor in a short time. He grabbed a\nman in black and asked coldly, \"Where is\nJasmine?\" The man in black, his mouth\nfull of blood and foam, cried out for\nthe leader. He lunged at Yong Doning\nwith all his might, and opened his mouth\nto bite. Yong Doning smashed the man's\nskull with a single punch, and the man\nin black fell to the ground, dying with\nhis eyes wide open. Yong Donging\nremained expressionless, but his fists\ntrembled slightly, revealing his inner\nturmoil. Upon witnessing all this, Nano\nvomited violently. Her face turned pale\nand her body trembled uncontrollably.\nSumu raised his glass and said calmly,\n\"What a pity about my M9 stake.\" Nanimo\nleaned against the trash can, her voice\ntrembling, \"Why did you do this? Just\nfor a few questions. So many people\ndied.\" She glared angrily at Sumu and\ndemanded, \"What do you mean by human\nlife?\" Sumu suddenly burst into\nlaughter, breaking the silence.\nInteresting. absolutely hilarious. He's\nclearly in the mud himself, yet he can't\nstand seeing others get muddy, too.\" He\nreplied coldly, \"Human life? It is human\nlife. Nothing more than human life.\"\nNanimo was stunned, feeling the cold\nindifference in Sumu's eyes, as if other\npeople's lives were nothing more than\ntools. Sumu raised his glass, took a sip\nof red wine, and said with a smile,\n\"These people are wasting air by living,\nbut it's an honor for them to die for\nme, and you. Is it an honor?\" He\nsuddenly turned to a man in black.\nGlory. The man in black kn one knee with\nfervor. Glory. To die for the leader is\nthe highest honor. We are the meaning\ngiven to us by the leader. And we will\ndedicate our lives to the leader. Nanimo\ngrew increasingly fearful. Sumu&lt;unk&gt;s\narrogance sent chills down her spine.\nChapter 12 must be very interesting.\nYong Donging entered the second floor\nwhere the walls were engraved with\nlifelike Urao's patterns and white\ncandles emitted the fragrance of\njasmine. His attention, however, was\nentirely focused on the gun barrel not\nfar away. The Viper gang had only two\nmembers armed with two guns who blocked\nhis path. Where is Jasmine? His answer\nwas a gunshot. Bang! The bullets shot\nout from the dark muzzle of the gun.\nYang Donging did not dodge. The bullet\nstruck his skin, tearing his clothes and\nrevealing his metallic skin. He looked\nat the two of them coldly. This kind of\ntoy. Bang, bang, bang. A barrage of\ngunfire rang out. Bullets struck him but\ncaused no harm. In the monitoring room,\nSumu watched all this with satisfaction\nwhile noticing Yong Dong&lt;unk&gt;s weakness,\nhis eyes. In that case, use grenades,\nSumu ordered. Two men in black pulled\nout grenades. Yong Donging rushed\ntowards them quickly, so fast that they\ndidn't have time to throw grenades. The\ntwo men raised their grenades and\ncharged at Yong Doning for the leader.\nBoom! An explosion rang out. The walls\nwere shattered, and when the smoke\ncleared, only two corpses and an\nunharmed Yong Doning remained. Sumu's\neyes gleamed with intense light. Yong\nDoning had become a superhuman less than\na month ago. Yet, he could ignore\nbullets and withstand grenades. But Yong\nDonging&lt;unk&gt;s violent cough interrupted\nSu Mu&lt;unk&gt;s thoughts. He wiped the blood\nfrom the corner of his mouth and\ncontinued on his way. It seems that Yong\nDong&lt;unk&gt;s internal organs are not as\nrobust as they appear. The third layer\nstill features the Uraor's pattern and\nwhite candles. This time, the enemy\nconsisted of two people wearing heavy\nfirefighting suits and wielding\nflamethrowers. They started spraying\nfire as soon as they saw Yong Doning.\nFlames quickly filled the entire\ncorridor, engulfing Yong Doning.\nHowever, the next moment, a charred\nfigure suddenly leaped out of the sea of\nfire and quickly pounced on the two men\nin protective suits. The two men dropped\ntheir flamethrowers and quickly pulled\nout grenades to meet Yong Doning. For\nthe leader, boom. The two were blown to\npieces. Although Yong Donging was\ninjured with his hair and eyebrows\nburned off and his clothes charred\nblack, he still moved forward quickly\nand seemed to be unharmed. In the\nmonitoring room, Nanimo watched all of\nthis in shock, finally realizing how\npowerful Yong Dona was. Invulnerable to\nswords and spears, impervious to water\nand fire. He's practically a superhero.\nIs this what a superhuman is like? Nano\nsecretly glanced at Su Mu and found that\nthere was no fear on his face, only\namusement, as if he were looking at an\ninteresting prey. She suddenly felt that\nSumu was more terrifying than the\nextraordinary Yong Doning. \"Aren't you\nworried at all?\" Nenmo asked. Worried.\nWorried about what? Sumu asked with a\nsmile. If you target superhumans like\nthis, what do you think they'll do once\nthey find out you're behind it all? Your\nsubordinates won't be able to stop them.\nSumu tilted his head slightly, his gaze\nsharp. Are you testing me? Nanimo was a\nlittle stunned. I was just curious. Sumu\nsmiled and said, \"Rather than worrying.\nI'm looking forward to it. Expect. Just\nimagine if Yong Donin came to me and saw\nthat his beloved woman was unharmed and\neven ate an M9 steak. How would he\nreact? Nan Mo&lt;unk&gt;s face turned pale\ninstantly. She understood what Sumu\nmeant. What would happen if Yong Doning\nfound out that she was an accomplice of\nthe Viper gang? She dared not think\nabout it anymore. It must be very\ninteresting. Sumu spoke softly, but his\nvoice sent chills down Ninmo&lt;unk&gt;'s\nspine. Don't worry, it won't be easy for\nhim to find me. The fourth layer is\npoison gas. I got this special poison\ngas from the black market and even\nsuperhumans might not be able to\nwithstand it. What if he holds on and\neventually comes to you? Sumu laughed\neven harder. That's even more\ninteresting. Maybe I'll get torn to\npieces. Haha. He seemed to be looking\nforward to that scene. Nano's feelings\nwere complicated and unrelated memories\nsuddenly flooded her mind. She recalled\nher childhood before her father became\naddicted to gambling when her family was\nvery happy. back then. She got a perfect\nscore on a test and her father rewarded\nher with a trip to the amusement park,\nmaking her happy for a whole week. The\nhappiness of those days makes me smile\njust thinking about it. At that moment,\nshe realized that Sumu was also in that\nstate of anticipation. Chapter 13.\nNanimo is the true fourth challenge.\nWant to play a game? Sumu suddenly\nlooked at Nanimo. Nanimo felt a wave of\npanic. She knew Sumu had no good\nintentions. What game? She took a deep\nbreath, trying to appear calm. In this\ngame of choosing one of two, who do you\nthink will win? Will I capture Yong\nDoning, or will Yong Donging tear me\napart? Nan Mo fell silent, unable to\nunderstand why the man in front of her\ntreated life so easily, like a game. I\ndon't know, and I don't want to choose.\nYou're thinking of it. Sumu tapped the\ntable with his fingers, making a\nrhythmic, dull sound. I'm allowing you\nto leave now. You can go and tell Yong\nDoning that there's poison gas on the\nfourth floor. Nan Mo&lt;unk&gt;s pupils\nsuddenly contracted. She had considered\npretending to go to the restroom and\nfinding an opportunity to tell Yong\nDoning. She didn't believe Sumu would\nlet Yong Doning off the hook. A test.\nHe's testing me. Naanimo realized and\nforced herself to remain calm, saying,\n\"It's no use telling him. When he sees\nthat I'm unharmed, he'll definitely\nrealize it and kill me in a fit of\nrage.\" Sumu smiled. Not necessarily. You\ncan make up a lie and say that your\nbrother was coerced by the Viper gang\nand that he suddenly realized his\nmistake and warned Yong Donging about\nthe poison gas trap, then apologize and\ngive him a hug and see how Yong Dona\nreacts. Nanimo did not answer, but felt\na chill run down her spine. \"He will\nforgive you,\" Sumu continued. \"But now\nyou have to make a choice. Stay with me\nor go find Yong Doning.\" Fear lingered\nin Nan Mo&lt;unk&gt;s eyes. Yet her\nstubbornness remained. She looked\ndirectly into Sumu&lt;unk&gt;s eyes. What\nexactly do you want? Sumu smiled. I'm\ngiving you a chance to live. If I lose,\nit will be too late for you to apologize\nwhen you meet Yong Donging, and you'll\ndefinitely die. If I win, you can go\nhome safely, and your younger brother\nwill become the factory manager. If you\ngo to find Yong Donging, I lose, and you\nand he can live happily ever after. If I\nwin, everything will be fine. Nanimo was\nstill uneasy, wondering, what exactly\nare you plotting? Sumu shrugged\nhelplessly. Miss Jasmine, you've really\nmisunderstood me from the beginning of\nour cooperation until now. Have I ever\nhurt you or your family? Are you\ndissatisfied with the compensation I\noffered? I'm really not satisfied, but\nall right, time is running out. In the\nsurveillance footage, Yang Doning had\nalready begun heading to the fourth\nfloor. Nanimo grew anxious, stood up,\ngave Sumu a complicated look, and\nprepared to leave. Wait a minute, Sumu\ncalled out to her. Nanimo turned around,\nher eyes flashing with anger. She knew\nSumu wouldn't let her leave easily.\nYou're playing tricks. Nandimo didn't\nfinish her sentence. It's fate that we\nmet, and this glass of wine is a\nfarewell to you. Sumu smiled, and handed\nover the glass. Nanimo took the wine\nglass, gave him a deep look, and then\ndrank it all in one gulp, leaving a\ndelicate lip print. \"I wish you\nsuccess,\" she whispered. \"Bang!\" The\ndoor slammed shut, and Nan Mo&lt;unk&gt;s\nfigure vanished. Sumu smiled, raised his\nglass, and drank the red wine in one\ngulp. Chief, are we really going to let\nher go and deliver the message like\nthis? What if? Ziao Xiao Yao, who was in\nthe corner, suddenly stepped forward,\nlooking worried. Sumu frowned slightly.\nAre you teaching me how to do things?\nXiao Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s expression changed\ndrastically, and he knelt on one knee.\nThis subordinate dares not. Sumu shook\nhis head helplessly. Foolish man, do you\nreally think poison gas can stop\nsuperhumans? It should be possible, Xiao\nXiao Yao thought. Superhumans need to\nbreathe. Even an elephant could collapse\nfrom inhaling poisonous gas. How long\ncan you hold your breath? Sumu asked\nback. 1 minute. Xiao Xiao asked\nuncertainly. How long can Yong Donging\nhold his breath? It should be longer\nthan mine. At least 2 minutes. Do you\nunderstand? Ziao Xiao seemed to\nunderstand. I get it now. If Yong\nDonging runs at full speed, he can cross\nthe fourth floor in 20 seconds. Even the\niron gate won't stop him. Do you\nunderstand now? Xiao Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s\nexpression changed drastically. He\nhurriedly stood up and reached out to\nhelp Sumu. What are you doing, Chief?\nSince poison gas won't work, let's leave\nquickly. You absolutely cannot be\nharmed. Sumu couldn't help but tap Xiao\nXiao&lt;unk&gt;s bald head. Get lost. What do\nyou think I let Nanimo go over there\nfor? Ziao Xiao Yao was stunned. Why? Of\ncourse, it's four. Sumu side. Forget it.\nYou wouldn't understand even if I\nexplained it to you. You just need to\nknow that Nan Mo is the real fourth\nlevel. Chapter 14. Sumu should have\nescaped. Unfazed by the swords, spears,\nand fire he had endured before. But now\nhis expression finally changed because\nhe saw a familiar beautiful figure.\nJasmine Yong Donging exclaimed in\nsurprise, quickening his pace. At this\nmoment, he was standing at the entrance\nof the fourth floor inside which was a\nspacious hall. Nanimo was standing at\nthe exit at the other end of the hall.\nJasmine, thank goodness. Are you all\nright? Yong Donging excitedly tried to\nrush over, but Nan Mo&lt;unk&gt;s expression\nchanged drastically. Don't come any\ncloser. Yong Donging was stunned. What's\nwrong, Jasmine? Don't worry. I'm here.\nDon't come any closer. There's poison\ngas here. Nan Mo shouted anxiously from\nacross the hall, her face flushed.\nPoison gas. Yong Doning paused, slightly\ntaken aback, his earlier joy vanishing\ninstantly. He realized something was\nwrong. Jasmine, what exactly is going\non? Yong Doning, I'm sorry, I lied to\nyou. Please don't come over. It's a\ntrap. Nan Mo&lt;unk&gt;'s voice was choked\nwith sobs, her face full of apology. You\nlied to me. Yong Doning&lt;unk&gt;s face\nturned ugly, and he vaguely sensed that\nsomething was wrong. I'm sorry. I was\nforced into it by Sumu. Sumu? Yong\nDonging was stunned. You mean my\nclassmate Sumu? Yes, he is the leader of\nthe Viper gang. He threatened me with my\nbrother, forcing me to lure you here.\nHis goal is the extraordinary power\nwithin you, and I had no choice but to\nagree. After getting to know you, I\nfound you to be a good person. I don't\nwant you to die. I'm sorry. Nenmo&lt;unk&gt;s\ntears fell like beads from a broken\nstring. Yong Dongqing remained silent,\nhis head lowered, shadows shrouding his\nface, making it difficult to discern his\nexpression. Suddenly, his footsteps\nsounded and he landed heavily on the\nfourth floor. Nanimo panicked. No, don't\ncome any closer. Please don't come any\ncloser. Yong Donging ignored him and\nwalked forward resolutely. Bang. He\nentered the fourth floor and the iron\ndoor behind him closed automatically,\nlocking him and Nano inside. The iron\ngate coldly and ruthlessly separated the\ntwo. Nanimo frantically pounded on the\niron gate, calling out, \"Young Doning!\nYong Doning!\" sizzle! Pale purple\npoisonous gas began to flood the hall,\ngradually engulfing Yong Doning&lt;unk&gt;s\nfigure. However, Yong Doning remained\ncompletely calm, a cold smile appearing\non his lips as he sneered at the camera\nin the corner. You know nothing about\nthe extraordinary,\" he said silently,\nthen held his breath, accelerated\nsuddenly, and became a blur as he rushed\ntoward the iron gate of the exit.\n\"Jasmine, stay away! Bang! Bang! Bang!\"\nHe rammed his body against the iron\ngate, the steel-like body making a\nviolent roar against the gate. The iron\ngate began to deform and collapse under\nthe impact until bang! The entire iron\ngate was knocked away. Yong Donging\nleaped out of the purple mist and\nJasmine stared in disbelief at the\nscene. Yong Doning Yu. Before she could\nfinish speaking, she crashed into Yong\nDoning&lt;unk&gt;s chest. Her feet left the\nground and he carried her away quickly\nbehind them raging poison gas. Yong\nDoning carried Nanimo and ran wildly\nuntil they reached the fifth floor where\nthe poisonous gas could no longer keep\nup. And then they stopped. He still\nhadn't let go of Nano. Instead, he gazed\nat her with eyes full of concern. Two\npairs of equally fervent eyes met at\nthis moment. \"You scared me. Why did you\ndo that? Do you know how dangerous it\nwas?\" Nanimo said, her voice trembling\nwith tears. A hint of tenderness melted\nacross Yong Dong&lt;unk&gt;s stern face as he\nwhispered. \"Fool, \"It's because you're\nhere.\" Nan Mo&lt;unk&gt;s eyes widened\nslightly, as if something had struck the\nsoftest part of her heart, and her body\ntrembled slightly. Tears welled up\nagain. But but I lied to you. It's all\nmy fault. A look of pity flashed in Yong\nDon&lt;unk&gt;s eyes as she gently\ninterrupted, \"I don't blame you. In\nfact, I'm very grateful to Sumu.\nIt's&lt;unk&gt; because of him that I was able\nto meet you.\" Nanimo stared at him\nblankly, overwhelmed by a surge of\nemotions. Unable to contain herself, she\ninstinctively embraced Yong Donging and\nkissed him deeply. Time seemed to stand\nstill at this moment. Even in the face\nof danger, nothing could stop the\ngenuine emotions. Of course, the members\nof the Viper gang were also sensible at\nthis point and did not cause any\ntrouble. This is love. In the monitoring\nroom, Sumu smiled inside. Through the\nmonitor, he saw the whole process, which\nfelt like watching a TV series. Chief,\nyou are truly amazing. This plot is\nexactly as you described. A sudden\nchange of heart, a desperate escape,\nwarning of the trap, and a passionate\nkiss. It's perfect. After flattering\nhim, Xiao Xiao said worriedly. However,\nchief, considering the time, shouldn't\nwe run away? He's already passed the\nfourth level. Sumu smiled mysteriously.\nYou're wrong. He didn't succeed.\nInstead, he failed. Xiao Xiao Yao was\nstunned, looking at the man and woman\nstill kissing in the surveillance video.\nWhy did it feel like a happy ending? Get\nready. We're going to meet our male\nlead. One minute later, the two\nseparated. It's a little salty. Yong\nDonging reminisced about his first kiss.\nYou're so annoying. Those are tears.\nNanimo playfully punched his chest a few\ntimes. I haven't even said anything to\nyou yet. You smell like burning. She\nsuddenly remembered something and\nhurriedly looked at Yong Doning. Are you\nall right? External injury. Then let's\nrun away quickly. Yong Doning sneered.\nIt's Sumu who should be fleeing. Nan\nMo&lt;unk&gt;s expression changed slightly.\nAre you still going? Of course. Sumu\ndared to use you. I'll make him know the\nprice of offending a superhuman. But\nJasmine, don't worry. I will protect\nyou, Yong Doning said firmly. Nanim Mo\nremained worried. Sumu&lt;unk&gt;s calm yet\ndangerous smile constantly flashing\nthrough her mind, filling her with\nunease. Chapter 15. If we can't reach an\nagreement, then there's no need to\ncontinue. By the way, Jasmine, how did\nyou escape? Yong Doning suddenly asked.\nNan Mo&lt;unk&gt;s eyes flashed, avoiding his\ngaze. I The entire Viper gang went to\ndeal with you, and only one person was\nwatching over me. I pretended to go to\nthe toilet and then came to tell you\nthank you for your hard work. Yang\nDoning took Nan Mo&lt;unk&gt;s hand and led\nher deeper into the fifth floor. Soon\nthey arrived in front of a huge wall\nwith dark gold patterns. On both sides\nwere men in black dressed in sharp suits\nand carrying guns. All with black snakes\ntattooed on their necks and their masks\nwere pitch black. Yong Donging shielded\nNan Mo behind him, his sharp eyes fixed\non the group. Suddenly, the men in black\ntook a step back, looked down with\nfervor at the back of the wall, as if\nthey were welcoming some important\nfigure. Yang Donging narrowed his eyes\nslightly, knowing that the mastermind\nbehind the scenes had finally revealed\nhimself. A bald, burly man in a black\nsuit slowly emerged from behind the\nwall, pushing a wheelchair. The person\nin the wheelchair was also dressed in a\nsuit, holding a snakeskin cane with a\npale face and handsome features hidden\nbehind tinted glasses. leader. A dozen\nmen in black shouted enthusiastically,\nbowing in unison to greet him. Sumu Yong\nDoning&lt;unk&gt;s face was cold and his eyes\nwere filled with killing intent. It\nreally is you. Sumu smiled and said,\n\"It's a pleasure to meet you, Yong\nDoning. Classmate O. You won't&lt;unk&gt;t be\nhappy for long.\" Yong Doning sneered,\nhis gaze as sharp as ice. Oh, but didn't\nyou just say you were very grateful to\nme for arranging your meeting with\nJasmine? Sumu smiled. Yong Dong&lt;unk&gt;s\neyes turned cold. Enough with the\nnonsense. You threatened Jasmine and\nstill dared to send people to attack me.\nHow do you plan to die? Sumu didn't seem\nto care, even toying with the snakes\nskin cane in his hand. You are indeed\nvery strong. But have you considered\nJasmine behind you? Bullets have no\neyes. What if she gets hurt? Yong\nDonging&lt;unk&gt;s face suddenly turned grim.\nAre you threatening me? Nmo&lt;unk&gt;'s face\nalso turned pale. She finally understood\nwhy Su Mu had asked her to leave. He had\nknown all along that the poison gas on\nthe fourth floor was useless and\ndeliberately used her as Yong\nDoning&lt;unk&gt;s weakness so that he could\nnot go all out. \"Don't put it so\nharshly. I'm just offering a friendly\nreminder. After all, you don't want\nanything to happen to Jasmine, do you?\"\nSumu continued. Nanimo instinctively\nshrank back, standing closer to Yong\nDoning. Yong Doning sensed her fear and\nhesitated for a moment. \"It seems I\nshould state my conditions,\" Su Mu\ncontinued. \"We have no eny with each\nother. I'm only here to ask a few\nquestions. What's the problem? Sumu\nsmiled. For example, how to obtain\nextraordinary power? Yong Doning\nsneered. You think you're worthy of\ncoveting the extraordinary? Sumu wasn't\nannoyed, still wearing a faint smile.\nDon't be so absolute. If you can do it,\nwhy can't I? A flash of anger crossed\nYong Dona&lt;unk&gt;s face. Humph. Give up on\nthat idea. Listen to the terms first. 1\nmillion for clues about extraordinary\npower. Sumu raised an eyebrow. 1\nmillion. Yong Doning sneered. Not\nenough. Okay, 10 million. Sumu seemed to\nhave expected this and immediately\nraised the price. Yang Doning sneered.\nSumu, I thought you were smart, but I\ndidn't expect you to be so foolish. If I\nkill you, the money will still be mine.\nSumu shrugged. If we can't reach an\nagreement, then there's no need to talk\nabout it. Click, click. The sound of\nover a dozen pistols being cocked rang\nout as members of the Viper gang raised\ntheir guns. Yang Doning&lt;unk&gt;s expression\nwas solemn, exuding a murderous aura,\nand the atmosphere was tense and ready\nto explode. Jasmine, don't worry. I'll\ntake all the bullets for you. Young\nDoning comforted her in a low voice.\nOnce the bullets are all gone, it will\nbe Sumu&lt;unk&gt;s death day. Sumu watched\nthe two with interest and waved. In an\ninstant, gunfire erupted. Bang! Bang!\nBang! The dense gunfire echoed in the\ndimly lit hall, bullets striking Yong\nDongqing&lt;unk&gt;s body and exploding into\nsmall sparks. He shifted his strong body\nbackward, but still managed to maintain\nhis balance. Despite the force of the\nbullet, it failed to harm him in the\nslightest. The firing lasted for half a\nminute. As the sound of an empty chamber\nrang out, Young Doning raised his head,\npanting heavily, and gave a cold smile.\nNext, it's my turn. Just as he was about\nto make a move, Sumu slowly reached into\nhis robes. Yang Doning&lt;unk&gt;s eyes\nnarrowed and he immediately stopped.\nSumu took out a dark gold open work\npocket watch from his pocket and gently\nflicked it open. It's about time, Sumu\nsaid calmly. Then he stood up from his\nwheelchair, leaning on his snake\npatterned wooden cane with one hand, and\nslowly walked towards Yong Doning. This\nscene made Yong Doning wary. \"What\nexactly do you want to do? Are you going\nto your death?\" Yong Doning asked\ncoldly. Sumu smiled. Yong Doning,\nhaven't you noticed yet? What did you\nnotice? Do you feel dizzy? Yong Donging\nwas taken aback, suddenly realizing that\nhe had felt somewhat dizzy since\nentering the fifth floor, but hadn't\npaid much attention to it. Hearing Su\nMu&lt;unk&gt;s words now, his heart skipped a\nbeat. Could it be? Do you feel tired in\nyour limbs? Are your eyes blurry? Yong\nDongqing was immediately alarmed. He did\nfeel tired and his vision blurred. He\nquickly shook his head to try to clear\nhis mind. Yong Doning? Nanimo asked\nanxiously. Are you all right? Yong\nDoning asked in a panic. What on earth\nis going on? Sumu strolled over\nleisurely, beginning his declaration of\nvictory as he walked. Chapter 16. Are\nyou sure you're taking me hostage?\nYou've been poisoned. Poison? Yong\nDonging stared wideeyed at Sumu.\nImpossible. I didn't inhale any of the\npoisonous gas from the fourth layer. How\ncould I be poisoned? Sumu smiled. Who\nsaid you were poisoned by the fourth\nlevel? Yong Doning was stunned,\ncompletely unaware of when he had been\npoisoned. But Nanim Mo behind him\ntrembled violently, a look of fear\nflashing in her eyes. Yong Doning\nquickly realized it was the meal that\nJasmine made. His expression instantly\nbecame complex, a mixture of anger,\ndisappointment, and sadness. \"Jasmine,\nyou?\" \"No, it wasn't me.\" NMO exclaimed,\nher face pale. \"I didn't poison it, and\nI ate it, too.\" Miss Nano, you seem to\nhave forgotten that you vomited once\nbefore. Sumu reminded her from the side.\nI didn't poison him. Yong Donging, you\nhave to believe me. It must have been\nSumu who secretly poisoned him while I\nwas cooking. Nanimo hurriedly defended\nherself. Yong Donging felt increasingly\nweak. His breathing became rapid. His\nhead spun and his consciousness\ngradually blurred. Thump. He fell\nheavily to the ground. Yong Donging.\nNaanimo was terrified and rushed to help\nhim up. But as a weak woman, how could\nshe possibly lift a man as strong as\nsteel? All right. All right. Actually,\nthat meal wasn't poisoned, Sumu said\nwith a smile, which made Nanimo breathe\na sigh of relief. However, it was indeed\nMiss Jasmine who administered the\npoison. You're talking nonsense. I\ndidn't. Nanimo shouted, almost losing\ncontrol. No. Sumu smiled. The poison\nresidue is still on your lips. Oh,\nright. It should have already entered\nYong Dong&lt;unk&gt;s stomach by now. It might\nstill taste a little salty. Naanimo\nfroze instantly, staring at Su Mu in\nastonishment. Suddenly, she remembered.\nIt was that glass of red wine. No, no,\nyou drank it, too. It was a wine glass.\nYou put poison on the rim of the glass\nand then put it on my lips. No wonder\nyou insisted I drink another glass\nbefore you left. You did it on purpose.\nIt was you, Dongqing. Dongqing, did you\nhear that? It wasn't me who poisoned it.\nIt was Su Mu who did it. Yong Dong&lt;unk&gt;s\nexpression darkened after listening to\nNan Mo&lt;unk&gt;s words. He said in a low\nhorsearse voice, \"You said before that\nyou secretly ran away. So why did you\ndrink red wine with him? You were able\nto pinpoint my location just now, which\nmeans you were watching the surveillance\nfootage, right?\" You sat in front of the\nmonitor the whole time, watching me make\na mess of myself while drinking red\nwine. \"Moly, which of your statements is\ntrue?\" Nanimo stood there stunned, her\nhands hanging limply at her sides, her\nface pale, her eyes vacant like a\nsoulless puppet. By the way, Miss\nJasmine, besides the red wine, you also\nate a fine M9 steak. Sumu reminded her\nfrom the side. Double kill. This one\nsentence completely shattered their\ndefenses. Seeing their distraught\nappearance, Sumu smiled slightly and\nsighed. Love is truly wondrous. Just a\nmoment ago, they were passionately\nkissing, and now they're like strangers.\nSo, may I ask my question now? Yong\nDoning. Sumu walked easily to within 3\nmeters of Yong Doning, a gentle smile on\nhis face. But in Yong Donging and Nan\nMo&lt;unk&gt;s eyes, that smile was as\nterrifying as a demon. \"Go ahead and\nask,\" Yong Doning said, his voice as he\nlowered his head. \"Okay, thank you for\nyour cooperation. First question, go to\nhell.\" Faced with this sudden change,\nYong Doning erupted, using all his\nstrength to pounce on Su Mu like a\nhungry tiger. 3 meters apart, a matter\nof life and death. With Yong Donings\nsteel-like body, even when weakened, he\ncould easily end everything if he\ntouched Sumu. However, Sumu nimly leaped\naway, avoiding Yong Dong&lt;unk&gt;s attack.\nBang! Yong Donging fell heavily to the\nground, creating several craters. He\nused up his last bit of strength, but\ncould not get up. Resentment, anger,\nhatred, all negative emotions filled his\neyes. He stared intently at Sumu, as if\nhe wanted to tear him apart. I knew you\nwouldn't cooperate obediently. After\nall, isn't that how it's always\nportrayed in TV dramas? Sumu gently\nbrushed the dust off his clothes. Now,\nI'll ask you questions and you'll answer\nthem. Dream on. I'd rather die than tell\nyou. You despicable scoundrel. Yong\nDonging roared. Sumu shrugged,\nunconvinced. Looks like I'll have to\nresort to some special methods. No.\nNanimo suddenly rushed forward, grabbing\nSu Mu&lt;unk&gt;s clothes tightly, tears\nstreaming down her face. \"Please, please\ndon't hurt him, Jasmine.\" Yong\nDongqing&lt;unk&gt;s eyes widened in anger,\nhis heart filled with mixed emotions.\n\"Don't beg him,\" Nanimo said, her eyes\nbrimming with tears. \"Dongqing, I'm so\nsorry. I can't&lt;unk&gt;t let him hurt you\nanymore.\" The two gazed at each other\ndeeply, their eyes red with emotion.\n\"Sigh.\" Sumu sighed. The way you're\ndoing this makes me feel like a bad guy.\nI just wanted to ask a few questions.\nWhy are you forcing me? Since that's the\ncase, then I have no choice but to\nwhoosh. A sharp dagger flashed across\nSumu's neck, and he felt a chill and a\nstinging pain. The dagger belonged to\nNanimo. Leader, protect the leader. Xiao\nXiao Yao and the others pald and rushed\nover. If you dare come any closer, I'll\nkill him. Nano roared like a cat with\nits fur standing on end. Xiao Xiao Yao\nand the others stopped in their tracks,\nclearly not daring to make any rash\nmoves. Sumu, release Yong Donging\nimmediately. Or I, I'll kill you, Nan\nMo&lt;unk&gt;s dagger trembled slightly, but\nher eyes were resolute. Jasmine, you go\nfirst, Yong Doning said urgently, more\nconcerned about Nanmo's safety than his\nown. Tsk tsk tsk, \"You two really change\nyour tune quickly. You've made up\nalready. In just one minute,\" Sumu\nexclaimed. Sumu quickly order Yong\nDongqing to be released. Nimmo said\nanxiously. Sumu smiled easily, seemingly\nunconcerned. Although the whole process\nwas a bit sour, it was still quite\nexciting, especially the twist. I was\noriginally on guard against Yong\nDona&lt;unk&gt;s counterattack, but I didn't\nexpect you, Miss Jasmine, to be so\nbrave, hiding a dagger in the Viper gang\nand taking the opportunity to kidnap me.\nHe suddenly changed the subject, his\nvoice low. Miss Jasmine, are you sure\nyou're taking me hostage? Chapter 17.\nThe substitute. What nonsense are you\nspouting? How could it not be? Nanimo\ntried to remain calm, but she felt\nuneasy inside. For the leader, Sumu's\nvoice suddenly became deep and fervent.\nThen he grabbed Nano&lt;unk&gt;'s hand and\nslashed it across her neck. Sizzle.\nBlood gushed out and Nano stared blankly\nat Sumu lying on the ground, his face\ncovered in blood. She watched in shock\nas the fanatical expression on his face\ngradually faded. I I killed someone.\nWhy? What? She looked at her\nbloodstained hands, the dagger falling\nto the ground with a crisp sound.\nSuddenly, applause erupted in the empty\nhall. Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant.\nThank you both for such a wonderful\nperformance. The voice came from a thin\nman in the Viper gang. He stepped out of\nthe crowd, removed his gas mask,\nrevealing his pale, handsome face. Sumu.\nThis? How is this possible? Nanimo\nlooked at Sumu in disbelief. If you were\nSumu, then who is he? Nanimo trembled as\nshe turned over Su Mu&lt;unk&gt;s fallen body\nand was stunned when she saw the\nunfamiliar face. The face didn't\nresemble Sumus. It belonged to a strange\nman whose features bore some resemblance\nto Sumus, but whose skin was unusually\npale, as if he were wearing makeup.\n\"This is impossible,\" Yong Donging\nexclaimed in astonishment. Although he\nwas weak, his eyes clearly saw that Su\nMu, who had been kidnapped, had now\nbecome someone else. Yong Donging\nsuddenly realized that Sumu had always\nbeen sickly and weak. How could such a\nperson have dodged his fatal blow just\nnow? That agile back jump now was not\nsomething a sickly person could do.\nYou're a superhum, too. Yang Doning\nstared at the newly appeared Sumu in\nshock. Sumu smiled without saying a\nword, then turned and ordered, Take\nthese two frightened guests away to\nrest. Yes, leader. Two men in black\nstepped forward and dragged Yong Donging\nand Nanmo away. Sumu was unwilling to\nwaste time explaining that the previous\nstand-in was only to test whether Yong\nDonging had any other tricks up his\nsleeve and he did not want to be\nattacked and killed during the\ninterrogation. Leader, you scared me to\ndeath. I thought you were. Ziao Xiao\nwalked to Su Mu&lt;unk&gt;s side, looking at\nthe substitutees corpse on the ground\nwith lingering fear. I understand the\nprinciple that a wise man does not stand\nunder a dangerous wall. Sum Mu said\ncoldly. Ziao Xiao Yao was startled and\nturned around abruptly only to find that\nSum Mu who had been standing in front of\nhim had disappeared. But the voice came\nfrom behind him. He turned around and\nsaw a man in black remove his mask\nrevealing Su Mu&lt;unk&gt;s face. This this is\nXiao Chaya was taken aback. He looked at\nSumu in front of him and suddenly\nrealized that this person was completely\nunfamiliar. It turned out that the Sumu\nin front of him was not the Sumu he\nknew. At this moment, Sumu, standing\nbehind him, slowly unbuttoned his suit\njacket, revealing bulletproof armor. It\nturned out that his muscular physique\nwas not something he was born with.\n\"What's wrong, Xiao Xiao? A wise man\ndoesn't stand under a dangerous wall.\nHave you forgotten?\" Sumu sneered. Xiao\nXiao Yao stood there, stunned. This is\ndeception, a sneak attack, poisoning,\nand manipulating people's hearts. This\ndoesn't meet the standards of a\ngentleman. Sumu raised an eyebrow\nslightly. Xiao Xia Yao quickly changed\nhis tune. Chief, the stand-ins you found\nare really good. Some of them even look\na bit like you. They are rare in the\nworld. Xiao Xiao cautiously examined\nSumu, then suddenly asked, \"Chief, is\nthis another standin you have?\" Sumu did\nnot answer, but simply took out his\nbrown glasses from his pocket, put them\non, and his deep eyes gradually\ndisappeared behind the lenses. Whether\nit looks like the real thing or not is\nnot important. What's important is the\nhypnosis. The Viper gang has calming\ncandles on every floor and Yong Donging\ninhaled quite a few while fighting his\nway here. Coupled with the hint of the\nUra Burough's symbol and Nan Mo&lt;unk&gt;s\nprior disclosure of my information. All\nof this laid the groundwork for\nhypnosis. As for choosing a stand-in who\nresembles me, it's because I've never\nhypnotized a superhum before, so I\nwanted to be on the safe side. Sumu said\ncalmly. Brilliant, Chief. You are truly\nbrilliant. Xiao Xiao Yao exclaimed\nenthusiastically, then asked with a hint\nof doubt. By the way, Chief, what about\nthe poisoning? I was shocked when the\ndouble told me. But now that I think\nabout it, something doesn't make sense.\nNan Mo&lt;unk&gt;s lips were poisoned. What if\nshe licked her lips halfway through or\ndidn't kiss Yong Doning? Wouldn't that\nmean, my plan will not fail? Sumu smiled\nmysteriously. Because there is no poison\nat all. What? Ziao Xiao was shocked and\nstunned. Have you heard of the water\ndroplet killing experiment? Someone did\nthis experiment, binding a death row\ninmate and blindfolding him, making him\nlisten to the sound of water droplets\nfalling continuously. In the end, he\ndied without bleeding. That's the power\nof psychological suggestion. A look of\nintoxication appeared on Sumu's face,\nclearly enjoying this power to\nmanipulate people's minds. Chapter 18.\nJasmine. Very moist. The power of\npsychological suggestion is so strong\nthat when you believe you are dead, you\nreally are dead. Yong Doning was\npoisoned because he believed he was\npoisoned. And under the influence of\nmental hypnosis, he began to show\nsymptoms of poisoning. Xiao Chaya was so\nshocked that his mouth dropped open. He\ndidn't understand, but he was deeply\nmoved. Sumu frowned slightly. Is it that\nhard to understand? But chief, how do\nyou explain Yong Donging&lt;unk&gt;s initial\ndizziness and weakness? Isn't this just\npsychological suggestion? Xiao Xiao\nasked doubtfully. Sumu sighed. If you\nwere in a great hurry, speeding along\nand then experienced bloody battles,\ngrenades, and fire while being\nsurrounded by the fragrance of calming\ncandles and finally holding your breath\nfor a minute in a gas chamber and\nkissing someone for a minute. Do you\nthink you wouldn't feel dizzy? Ziao Xiao\nYao was stunned for a moment, then\nthought for a moment and said, \"I will\ndie. You son of a bitch.\" Bang. Sumu\nstruck Xiao Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s bald head hard\nwith his snakeskin king. \"Chief, I am so\nstupid, so incredibly foolish,\" Xiao\nXiao Yao said, rubbing his head, still\nsmiling. \"I have tried my best to\nunderstand your profound principles. You\nare like a god descended from heaven.\nPlease explain further.\" Looking at Xiao\nXiao Yao&lt;unk&gt;s fawning manner, Sumu\nsighed helplessly, feeling a headache\ncoming on. He had drunk some red wine,\nwhich had relieved the headache\nslightly, but now it was starting to\nhurt again. If only hypnosis could make\npeople smarter, he thought. But that was\nimpossible. Even if a poor student was\nhypnotized, he wouldn't be able to solve\nmath problems he couldn't solve before.\nIf you don't understand the\nextraordinary version, then I'll tell\nyou the ordinary version. Actually, I\npoisoned it. Xiao Xiao was taken aback,\nfilled with doubt. What is it? Poisonous\nor not? Sumu continued. The food that\nJasmine made for Yong Dongqing was\nindeed poisonous, but that poison won't\ntake effect until a chemical reaction\noccurs. The wine glass is also\npoisonous. It's harmless on its own, but\nit can catalyze the first type of\npoison. Xiao Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s eyes lit up. Oh,\nso was Jasmine's vomiting after watching\nthe surveillance footage also caused by\nyour hypnosis? He suddenly felt a chill\nrun down his spine. Would you like to\nhear a third version? Sumu asked with a\nsmile. What? There's a third version.\nYes, the third version is a mixture of\nthe extraordinary and the ordinary\nversions. I administered the poison and\nI also used psychological suggestion.\nYaong Dongqing&lt;unk&gt;s poisoning was due\nto a combination of factors. Otherwise,\nhow could an extraordinary person be so\neasily poisoned? Ziao Xiao Yao was\ncompletely stunned, feeling like his\nhead was about to explode. Chief, which\nversion is the real one? Sumu smiled\nwithout saying a word, then walked away\nwith his cane, leaving Ziao Xiao Yao\nscratching his head in frustration.\nChief, wait for me. Which version is\ntrue? Tell me, leader, can I ask a\ndifferent question? Why not just\nhypnotize Jasmine and make her carry out\nthe orders instead of letting her\nchoose? In the end, a substitute died.\nSumu stopped and disappeared into the\ndimly lit corridor, his calm voice\nechoing. Because I like surprises. Xiao\nXiao Yao froze, staring blankly at the\nfigure shrouded in darkness. Don't you\nfind the struggle of human nature\ninteresting? A life where everything is\ncontrolled is too boring. Sumu's voice\ngradually faded into the distance. The\nSerpent Gangs dungeon. Yang Dongqing was\nbound by iron chains and fixed to a\nsteel chair with a middle-aged man in a\nwhite coat standing next to him. Sumu\nentered the dungeon and the man in the\nwhite coat bowed excitedly. Chief, how\nis the situation? Sumu asked, his gaze\nsweeping over Yong Dongqing&lt;unk&gt;s angry\neyes. The man in the white coat replied,\n\"As you instructed, I have him inhale\nthe paralyzing gas every hour. He\ndoesn't even have the strength to move a\nfinger now.\" Sumu nodded, turning his\ngaze to the imprisoned Yong Doning.\nSumu, you despicable scoundrel. I'd\nrather die than tell you anything. Oh.\nSumu pushed up his brown tinted glasses,\na playful smile curving his lips. You're\nnot afraid of death. So, what about Miss\nJasmine? Yong Donging froze, then flew\ninto a rage. His eyes turned bloodshot\nand his muscles bulged. He pulled the\nchain violently, making a crackling\nsound. If you dare touch Jasmine, I'll\ntear you to pieces. Sumu stared\nexpressionlessly at the man in the white\ncoat. The man in the white coat was\ncovered in cold sweat. Impossible. He\njust inhaled numbing gas. Even an\nelephant couldn't move in such a short\ntime. Chief, I will increase the dosage\nimmediately. Please put on your gas\nmask. Soon, the two put on gas masks and\nthe man in the white coat pressed a\nbutton and a hissing sound rang out. A\nlarge amount of white smoke was released\nfrom the pipe. A few minutes later, Yong\nDonging completely lost her strength and\nstopped struggling. Sumu looked at Yong\nDonging through the mask, seemingly lost\nin thought. His strength seems to be\nrelated to emotions or willpower. When\nNano was mentioned just now, his anger\ncaused some strength to surge back into\nhis paralyzed body. Sumu walked to Yong\nDong&lt;unk&gt;s side and whispered in his\near, \"Jasmine is very moist.\" Chapter\n19. Cruel punishments. \"Who?\" Yong\nDoning suddenly looked up, his eyes\nbloodshot, and a terrifying power surged\nfrom within him. \"Uh, I'll [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] kill\nyou.\" He struggled frantically, the\nchains trembling violently, making the\nentire dungeon seemed to shake. \"Leader,\nrun! He's about to break free!\" The man\nin the white coat shouted in terror,\nlooking at Yong Donging like a wild\nbeast about to be released from its\ncage. However, Sumu remained standing\ncalmly, watching Yong Donging with a\ncool gaze. A massive surge of spiritual\npower rushed into Yong Doning&lt;unk&gt;s\nmind, but encountered strong resistance.\nSure enough, Yong Doning strength is\nclosely related to his emotions and\nwillpower. Sumu's heart stirred and he\ndiscovered that when Yong Doning was\nangry, both his strength and mental\nresistance increased. \"Go and bring Miss\nJasmine here,\" Sumu ordered. The man in\nthe white coat immediately took action.\nShortly after, Nanimo walked into the\ndungeon dressed neatly. Upon seeing her,\nYong Doning&lt;unk&gt;s anger subsided\nslightly. \"Jasmine, are you all right?\nDid they hurt you?\" Yong Donging asked\nanxiously. \"No, they didn't hurt me.\"\n\"Donging, are you all right?\" Nanimo\nasked, her eyes filled with tears,\nfeeling a pang of pity as she saw Yong\nDoning locked up. Yong Doning&lt;unk&gt;s\npower seemed to have subsided as a\nresult. Jasmine, I will definitely get\nyou out of here, he said firmly. He\nturned to Sumu. Didn't you want to ask\nme questions? Release Jasmine and I'll\ntell you everything. Sumu shook his\nhead. I don't like things that are too\neasy to get, so you'd better not talk\nabout it yet. Yang Doning was stunned.\nThen his anger flared up again. Too easy\nto get. You've been working on this for\nso long and so many of your men have\ndied and now you say it's too easy. Are\nyou crazy? Sumu ignored him and turned\nto his subordinates ordering. Take Miss\nJasmine back to her room. No one is\nallowed to approach her without my\npermission. Also bring her a bottle of\nred wine and a fine M9 steak. Nan mo.\nSoon Nano was taken away and Sumu also\nleft the dungeon. He didn't believe Yang\nDaing. Could someone who hated you to\nthe core be trusted? Sumu preferred to\nprobe in his own way. In the dungeon,\nYong Dongqing was left alone in the\ndarkness. Suddenly, laughter and\ncheerful voices rang out, accompanied by\na fragrant aroma. Sumu, what exactly do\nyou want to do? Yong Donging roared.\nSurrounding him was a row of voluuptuous\nand charming young women. Hey, handsome,\ngive me a smile. You won't smile? Well,\nI'll give you one, baby. I don't know\nwhy, but my heart races whenever I see\nyou. Wow, ladies. This handsome guy has\na great body. All those hard muscles. He\nHei. Is it really hard? I don't believe\nit. Let me touch it. Yong Dongqing&lt;unk&gt;s\nanger finally broke down. His face\nturned red and he could no longer\nmaintain his rage. In the monitoring\nroom, Sumu watched all of this. Ziao\nXiao Yao stared in disbelief. Chief, is\nthis the torture you were talking about?\nWhat? You want to try it, too? Sumu\nasked casually. Ziao Xiao Yao swallowed\nhard. It's not impossible, but I can't\nresist this temptation. I can only look,\nbut not touch. That would be unbearable.\nThis torture is different from what I\nimagined. Yong Dongqing possesses a body\nof steel, making conventional\npunishments ineffective against him, and\nhis strength is related to his anger.\nTherefore, we must punish him, but we\ncannot let him become too angry,\" Sumu\nexplained. But chief, what's the use of\nthis? If it doesn't hurt him, will he\nsubmit? Ziao Xiao asked, puzzled. What I\nwant is not submission, but a mental\nbreakdown and a weakening of his\nwillpower,\" Sumu said with a smile.\nHours later, Yong Dong&lt;unk&gt;s eyes were\nbloodshot, and he was panting heavily.\nTo prevent him from getting tired of the\ngirls, Sumu changed the girls several\ntimes along the way. \"Have them\nwithdraw.\" Yong Donging has adapted.\n\"Move on to the next punishment,\" Sumu\nordered. The young ladies were taken\naway, but Yong Donging was left behind,\ncovered in lipstick marks. Sumu, you\nbastard. Come on. Come on. Yong Doning\ncursed angrily. Snap. The dungeon door\nopened again, and a cold-looking man\nentered, dressed in a black suit and\nholding a box of powder. Yong\nDonging&lt;unk&gt;s face instantly turned\ngreen. Why did it change to a man? The\nman poured the powder onto Yong Doning.\nInstantly, Yong Doning felt an\nunbearable itch all over his body. This\nis itching powder, huh? Sumu, you\n[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] huh? Laughter echoed through the\ndungeon. Yong Doning was on the verge of\na mental breakdown, his voice. A few\nhours later, Yong Doning laughed so hard\nhe could barely keep up, his spirits\ncompletely exhausted. He didn't expect\nthat real punishments were far more\nbrutal than those depicted in TV dramas,\nsomething that could not be resisted by\nwillpower alone. However, even cruer\npunishments were yet to come. Snap! The\ndungeon door opened again, and Yong\nDonging stared intently at the entrance.\nSumu slowly walked in carrying a thick\nstack of books. Yong Dongqing&lt;unk&gt;s\nanger flared up again. Sumu, you chapter\n20, just a trigonometric function. Yong\nDonging, do you know what the greatest\nresponsibility of a student is? Sumu\ninterrupted calmly. What trick are you\ntrying to pull now? The biggest\nresponsibility of a student is to study.\nYou, Yong, Doning, are at the bottom of\nthe class and have dragged the class\ndown. As the class monitor, I have an\nobligation to tutor you. Sumu pushed up\nhis glasses, holding a thick stack of\nbooks, and it seemed as if the words\nexcellent in both character and\nacademics were written all over his\nface. Sumu, you're a lunatic. What am I\nsupposed to learn? Sumu shook his head.\nYour attitude towards learning is not\nright. It seems I need to motivate you.\nAs he spoke, he took out a math workbook\nand placed it in front of Yong Doning.\nCome on, let's solve this trigonometric\nfunction problem. The formulas are all\nin the book. I'll help you. Yong\nDongqing was about to get angry, but\nSumu&lt;unk&gt;s next words made his\nexpression change. \"If you can't&lt;unk&gt;t\ndo it within 15 minutes, I'll cut off\none of Miss Jasmine's fingers,\" Sumu\nsaid with a smile. Yang Doning suddenly\nlooked up, his face filled with rage.\n\"You dare? If you dare to lay a finger\non Jasmine, \"Shill, don't be impatient,\"\nSumu interrupted. \"I always keep my\nword. If I say I'll cut off one finger,\nI won't cut off two. Now the chance to\nsave her is in front of you. If you\ntruly love her, solve this problem. It's\njust a trigonometric function problem.\nYou learned it in class and the textbook\nis right in front of you. If you can't\ndo it, don't blame me. Sumu smiled, took\nout his pocket watch, placed it on the\ntable, and then turned to leave. Yong\nDonging was furious, but soon he\nrealized that Su Mu was capable of\nanything. So, he turned his attention to\nthe question. Phew. Just a trigonometric\nfunction problem. Easy. He took a deep\nbreath and examined the question. In\ntriangle ABC, angle A= 60\u00b0, A= 3, and\nB=&lt;unk&gt; 3. Find the measure of angle B.\nTime ticked by minute by minute 3\nminutes. Uh, just how big is this B?\nThere's a saying that goes, when people\nare desperate, they'll do anything. But\nclearly, this doesn't apply to Yong\nDonging, who still can't solve the math\nproblem. 15 minutes later, Sumu\ngracefully entered the dungeon holding a\ncrystal goblet filled with bright red\nwine. Yong Doning, have you come up with\nthe answer yet? Yong Doning looked up,\nhis eyes bloodshot, still muttering.\nSinbi equals B multiplied by Cena\ndivided by A, which equals the square\nroo&lt;unk&gt; of 3 * since 60\u00b0. 15 minutes\nare almost up. Stop arguing. I'm almost\ndone. Sin B equals 1/2 because it is\ngreater than B. Angle A is greater than\nangle B. Sin B equals 1/2. Yong\nDona&lt;unk&gt;s expression suddenly changed\nand he blurted out. Angle B equals 30\u00b0.\nHuh? I figured it out. Snap. Snap. Snap.\nSumu smiled and clapped.\nCongratulations, Yong Dona. You've saved\nMiss Jasmine's finger. However, before\nYong Doning could be happy, Sumu\npresented him with a new problem. 15\nminutes still. If you can't solve it,\nI'll cut off one of Miss Jasmine's toes.\nSumu, you bastard. What the hell do you\nwant to do? Sumu smiled. My mental state\nis pretty good, but there are more\nchallenges ahead. You only have 15\nminutes. After saying that, he left,\nleaning on his cane. Yang Donging was on\nthe verge of collapse. After his anger\nsubsided, he had no choice but to turn\nhis attention to the new problem. Upon\nseeing the question, his vision went\nblack. 1 3 8 20 48 112 256 1. Find the\ngeneral term formula for this sequence.\nTwo, find the 20th term. Three, from\nwhich term does this sequence begin to\nexceed 10,000? Sumu i. The next day,\nYong Doning spent a sleepless night.\nAfter a night of math problems, Yong\nDoning&lt;unk&gt;s math skills improved\ndramatically. He mastered trigonometric\nfunctions, arithmetic sequences,\ngeometric sequences, and linear\nequations in two variables. But he was\non the verge of a mental breakdown with\nsunken eyes, a blank expression, and\nlifeless eyes. The girls from yesterday\nreappeared, but no matter how they\ndanced, Yong Dona&lt;unk&gt;s eyes remained\nunresponsive. Monitoring room. Sumu\nobserved Yong Doning&lt;unk&gt;s mental state\nand prepared to begin deep hypnosis.\nEverything was designed to weaken Yong\nDoning&lt;unk&gt;s mental strength, especially\nthe final math problem. Only a poor\nstudent could understand the agony of\nbeing unable to solve it. Even though\nsuperhumans possess strong mental power,\ntheir mental state must be pushed to its\nlimit to ensure successful hypnosis.\nThis time he wants to do deep hypnosis,\nnot just simple psychological\nsuggestion. Deep hypnosis can completely\ndistort thoughts, while psychological\nsuggestion is only superficial. The\neffects of deep hypnosis are more\nlasting, Sumu muttered to himself.\nDungeon Yong Donging&lt;unk&gt;s eyes were\nglazed over. When he heard the door\nopen, he jolted as if by reflex, and a\nlook of terror appeared on his face. No,\nno, I don't want to do math problems\nanymore. Yang Doning gagged painfully\nand Sumu looked at him with\nsatisfaction. It seems you have absorbed\nall the mathematical knowledge and are\nquite full. It seems we can proceed to\nthe final stage. Yang Doning remained\nconfused unconsciously muttering sign\ncosine tan cot chapter 21. The bronze\nlaw heart of steel bite. A delicate dark\ngold openwork pocket watch flicked from\nSumu&lt;unk&gt;s fingertips and landed in\nfront of Yong Donging. The pocket watch\nwas connected by a thin chain, the end\nof which was held in Sumu's hand. With a\nlittle force, the dark gold pocket watch\nbegan to swing. It swings very slowly\nbut very regularly, each swing precise,\nlike the second hand on a clock face.\nLook at it carefully. Sumu's deep voice\nrang out. At the same time, he took off\nhis brown glasses, revealing a pair of\ndeep and beautiful eyes as black as\nobsidian. Whether it was my imagination\nor not, those eyes seemed like luminous\npearls in a dimly lit dungeon, faintly\nemitting a ghostly glow. A massive\nspiritual force began to spread\nthroughout the dungeon. Yang Donging\nsubconsciously glanced at the dark gold\npocket watch in front of him. His eyes\nfollowed its swaying motion. His mind\ngradually drawn in slowly, slowly. His\neyes were fixed on the pocket watch. The\nsilent darkness spread, gradually\nengulfing everything. And even Sumu, who\nwas right in front of him, seemed to\ndisappear into the darkness. Gradually,\nthe dark gold Uraos on the pocket watch\ncame to life. It wriggles and twists in\nthe darkness, intertwining and\ncrisscrossing, mysterious and\nextraordinary. Now, Sumu&lt;unk&gt;s eyes\nflashed and a massive amount of\nspiritual power surged into Yong\nDong&lt;unk&gt;s mind like a tide. Silently,\nleaving an Urao&lt;unk&gt;s symbol in his\nmind. The dark golden Uraos seemed to be\nreflected in Yong Dong&lt;unk&gt;s pupils\nbefore slowly disappearing. Few, Sumu\nlet out a long breath, feeling unsteady\non his feet, as if his body had been\nhollowed out. as expected of an\nextraordinary being. Even after\nexperiencing such inhuman torture, they\nstill have considerable mental\nresistance. Fortunately, they succeeded.\nHe shifted his gaze to Yong Donging,\nwhose eyes were lifeless and blank, like\na soulless doll. Yong Doning, Sumu said\nslowly. His words were like commands to\nactivate a puppet. The moment they were\ninput, Yong Doning&lt;unk&gt;s lifeless eyes\ngradually regained their color, a\nfervent fervor. leader. Sumu smiled\nsilently, but he didn't indulge in his\njoy too much because he needed to obtain\nextraordinary power as soon as possible\nsince he didn't have many days left to\nlive. How did you become a superhuman? I\nbecame an extraordinary being in the\nnightmare world. Nightmare world? Sumu\nfrowned slightly. So, it really was\nrelated to his dream. He remembered his\ndream. Every time he fell asleep, he\nwould inevitably enter a dream. And each\ntime he entered a dream, his mental\nstrength would increase. What is the\nnightmare world? He asked his second\nquestion. The nightmare world is the\nworld after you fall asleep. It is a\nworld made up of countless nightmares\nfilled with all sorts of bizarre,\nterrifying, and incomprehensible\nnightmare monsters. As he said this, a\nhint of fear appeared on the face of\nthis arrogant superhuman. This surprised\nSumu. The fact that Yong Doning could\nstill experience fear under hypnosis\nmeant that the fear brought to Yong\nDoning by the nightmare world had\npenetrated to the bone. Yong Doning took\na deep breath and said again, \"I don't\nknow when it started, but the boundary\nbetween reality and dreams has been\nbroken. This has led to things in dreams\nbeing able to invade reality and people\nin reality being able to mistakenly\nenter dreams. You mean nightmare\nmonsters are also hidden in the real\nworld.\" Sumu recalled the various rumors\nhe had heard before. Those absurd and\nunbelievable terrifying events were\noften talked about by students. However,\nat that time, he was so engrossed in his\ndreams that he didn't care about reality\nat all. That's right. If people can\nenter the nightmare world, then the\nmonsters of the nightmare world can\nnaturally invade reality. Can you\nimagine that kind of fear? The nightmare\ndeep within your heart, the thing you\nfear most, suddenly crawling out of your\ndreams one day, or you falling into a\nreal nightmare, facing the nightmare in\nyour heart head on. That feeling, it's\nsimply simply the fear on Yong Doning's\nface intensified. That's absolutely\nbrilliant. Sumu's suppressed excitement\ndispelled Yong Dona&lt;unk&gt;s fear. He\nsuddenly felt a sense of anticipation\nfor the nightmare world. He had long\nforgotten what fear was. In the more\nthan 100 years in the dream world, he\nexperienced everything in the world. In\nthe later stages, in order to consume\nhis mental energy, he constantly created\nterrifying monsters or images to\nstimulate himself. The consequence of\nthis is that his emotional thresholds\nbecome infinitely high, making it\ndifficult for even the strongest fears\nto affect him. To be honest, this\nfeeling is very boring. When nothing in\nthe world can stir your heart, it's like\nbeing a monk or a unic. This is not a\ndetached state of mind that is unmoved\nby external gains or losses, but rather\na boredom and weariness after having had\nenough of everything. How do I enter the\nnightmare world? Sumu asked expectantly.\nSleep. You can only enter the nightmare\nworld while you're asleep. It's like a\nnightmare you'll never wake up from. A\nmonth ago, I woke up from a deep sleep\nand found myself in the nightmare world.\nThere were other people like me there\nwho also entered while they were asleep.\nWe encountered a group of terrifying\nmonsters inside. They they ate people.\nThey all died. Yang Doning&lt;unk&gt;s\nexpression grew increasingly fearful and\nhe even seemed to be showing signs of\nbreaking free from the hypnosis. Sumu\nnarrowed his eyes slightly and quickly\nchanged the subject. How to become an\nextraordinary being in the nightmare\nworld. The bronze law. Yong Doning\nuttered a term that Sumu found\nunfamiliar. What is the bronze law? I I\ndon't know. A look of confusion flashed\nin Yong Doning&lt;unk&gt;s eyes. It's like a\nhuge net hidden in endless dimensions in\nthe nightmare world. It is\nall-encompassing and omnipresent. As\nlong as you connect to the bronze law,\nyou can become a superhuman. Sumu's\nbrows furrowed deeper and deeper. He\ncould understand every word Yong Doning\nsaid, but he couldn't understand them\nwhen they were put together. Bronze\nlaws, a vast net. How do we connect to\nthe bronze law? There is no fixed\nmethod. It all depends on individual\ntalent. Those with high talent will\nsense the bronze law and connect to it\nupon their first entry into the\nnightmare world. What about those with\nlower talent? Those with low talent may\nneed to enter the nightmare world\nmultiple times to connect to the bronze\nlaw. There is another type of person who\nhas no talent and will never be able to\nconnect. How many times have you been to\nthe nightmare world? Once Sumu, so\nyou're saying Ning is a genius? Are all\nsuperhumans like you possessing bodies\nof steel? Yang Donging shook his head.\nMy extraordinary power is called iron\nwill, which is a relatively common kind\nof extraordinary power. After obtaining\niron will, my physical attributes were\nenhanced in all aspects, and my body\nbecame comparable to steel. This\nphysical strength can also be\ntemporarily enhanced by willpower,\nemotional fluctuations, etc. Chapter 22.\nYong Doning, you don't want anything to\nhappen to Miss Jasmine, do you? Was able\nto unleash his power after being\nparalyzed and hearing that Jasmine was\nmoist was related to this. Iron will\niron refers to a body of steel, while\nambition refers to the strengthening of\nthat body through willpower and emotion.\nSimply put, the more intense the\nemotions, the stronger the body of\nsteel, or the more resolute the will,\nthe stronger the body of steel. The\nbronze laws are all-encompassing, and\nthe corresponding supernatural powers\nare also numerous. However, I don't know\nexactly what they are. Even this\ninformation is thanks to one of the\nnightmare apostles who came from the\nupper city who told me about it last\ntime. Nightmare apostle, is that a\nnickname for people like you? Yong\nDoning nodded. Anyone who has entered\nthe nightmare world, whether superhuman\nor ordinary, is called a nightmare\napostle. This is an ominous title\nbecause all nightmare apostles will\neventually die in nightmares. Why? The\nperson from the upper city said that\nevery day in this world, some unlucky\npeople dream of becoming nightmare\napostles, entering the nightmare world\nin their sleep. This is completely\nrandom, and anyone can be one of them.\nMoreover, once entered, it's like being\ninfected with a curse. One will enter\nevery so often, experiencing nightmare\nafter nightmare until death. Is there\nany way I can enter the nightmare world?\nYong Donging shook his head again.\nThere's no way. Nobody knows how to\nenter the nightmare world, just as\nnobody knows how to get out of it. Being\nchosen as a nightmare apostle seemed\ncompletely random with no discernable\npattern. Hearing this, Sumu's expression\ndarkened. Is it possible to become a\nsuperhum without entering the nightmare\nworld? Yes, I heard from that person\nfrom the upper city that there are some\nextraordinary individuals hidden in this\nworld and none of them are nightmare\napostles. How did they become\nsuperhumans? I only know part of it. The\nman was killed by the nightmare monster\nbefore he could finish speaking. His\nexact words were that these superhumans\nin the real world are a bunch of\ncowardly freeloaders who grew up by\nsucking the blood of nightmare apostles.\nYong Donging pondered for a moment. His\ntone was very angry at the time, as if\nhe was very resistant to the identity of\nthe nightmare apostle. That resistance\nwas not only about facing the nightmare\nmonster, but also about how people in\nthe real world would also be detrimental\nto the nightmare apostle. Sumu's eyes\nflickered, sucking the blood of the\nnightmare apostle. Was it the literal\nmeaning, or give me some of your blood,\na sharp cut on his wrist? In a room\nfilled with medical equipment and\nexperimental devices, a man in a white\ncoat is conducting various experiments\nwith a dropper holding a test tube\nfilled with blood. How is it? Sumu\nasked, leaning against the corner of the\nwall. Chief, this blood is no different\nfrom ordinary blood. At most, it's just\na bit healthier. Drink it. Yes, leader.\nThe man in the white coat drank the\nblood in his hand in one gulp. Sumu\nwaited for him for a full hour, but\nnothing changed. It seems that the\nprevious statement did not mean vampire\nliterally. He now faces two paths. One\nis to go to the upper city to\ninvestigate information about\nsuperhumans and learn their methods to\ngain superhuman power. The other is to\nfind a way to enter the nightmare world\nand become a superhuman. He chose the\nsecond path with almost no hesitation.\nThere is a natural barrier between\nShanqing district and Shaqing district.\nIt's not just about having money to get\nin. You need money, connections, and\ninfluence to obtain a residence permit\nin Shanching District. Of course, this\nwas not a difficult task for him. It\nonly took a little time. However, after\nentering, investigating the information\nabout the superhumans would take some\ntime, and time was what he lacked most\nright now. He had already spent 3 days\ncapturing Yong Donging, and he only had\n4 days left to live. For Sumu, none of\nthe above reasons are actually the\nfundamental cause. What truly led him to\nchoose the second path was that who\ncould resist a nightmare world where\ndeath was everpresent, mysterious,\nterrifying, and thrilling. When he heard\nYong Dong&lt;unk&gt;s description of the\nnightmare world, his long dormant heart\nfinally began to beat again. But how can\none enter the nightmare world? Or\nrather, I've actually been in it all\nalong. For a moment, Sumu thought of the\ndream he had every day. It was so real\nthat it didn't feel like a dream. But it\nwas completely different from the\nnightmare world that Yong Doning had\ndescribed. In my dreams, everything is\nthere except for danger. I can have\nwhatever I want. According to Yong\nDoning, the only way to enter the\nnightmare world is through luck. If your\nluck is bad enough, you can dream about\nthe nightmare world and then enter it.\nThe problem is that as soon as I fall\nasleep, I enter that omnipotent dream\nwhich is equivalent to directly blocking\nout the nightmare world. He pondered for\na moment and an idea gradually took\nshape in his mind. Sumu returned to the\ndungeon. When he met Yong Donging, he\nwas surprised to find that Yong Donging\nhad broken free from hypnosis. Keep in\nmind that only an hour has passed. You\nbastard. What did you just do to me?\nYong Donging roared in shock and anger,\nclearly still shaken by the hypnosis he\nhad just experienced. The feeling of\nbeing completely transformed is more\nterrifying than losing one's life. Sumu\nstared at him. such high mental\nresistance. Are all extraordinary beings\nlike this? Or does Yong Doning's iron\nwill have a certain resistance by its\nown? Never mind, it's not important. He\nnever intended to keep Yong Doning as a\npuppet forever. To him, there were very\nfew interesting people in the world, but\nit was precisely these people who made\nthe world colorful. He was tired of the\nfeeling of controlling everything. This\nwas the case when he did not completely\ncontrol Ninmo before and now he\nnaturally would not completely control\nYong Dong&lt;unk&gt;s thoughts. However, while\nhe was unwilling to control her, it\ndidn't mean he would let Yong Doning go.\nThe two have become enemies, and letting\ngo of an enemy would be a foolish thing\nto do. So, Sumu began to use another\nmethod, psychological suggestion.\nCompared to the coercive nature of\nhypnosis, psychological suggestion is\nundoubtedly covert, difficult to detect,\nand can ignore mental resistance. Simply\nput, hypnosis is the forced control of\nanother person's mind, which will cause\nresistance at the mental level.\nPsychological suggestion is a subtle\nform of brainwashing, distorting your\nthoughts and making you accept things\nnaturally. Just like in the workplace,\nif your boss assigns you a task outside\nof your job description and you resist\nit, your boss has two ways to deal with\nyou. One is to use their power to\npressure you, telling you to get out if\nyou don't want to do it, or to make\nthings difficult for you. Another method\nis to manipulate you by saying, \"It's\nnever a bad thing to learn more. I'm\ntraining you.\" Only through training can\nyou play a greater role in a higher\nposition. The relative strength of the\nresistance to either approach is\nobvious. So, Sumu is now planning to use\nPua. No psychological manipulation on\nYong Doning. He sat on a chair to the\nside, his hands folded as he leaned on a\nsnakeskin cane, calmly gazing at Yong\nDonging and slowly said, \"Young Doning,\nyou don't want anything to happen to\nMiss Jasmine, do you?\" Chapter 23.\nPleasant Cooperation. Yong Doning&lt;unk&gt;s\nexpression suddenly changed. \"What are\nyou trying to do now?\" Clang Clang\nClang. The iron chains wrapped around\nhis body trembled wildly. It's nothing,\njust a little bit of insignificant\ncompensation. Yong Dong&lt;unk&gt;s chest\nheaved violently. He suppressed the urge\nto burst into curses and gritted his\nteeth, saying, \"What compensation? You\narrested me, and now you want\ncompensation from me.\" Sumu's face\nshowed surprise. I invited Miss Jasmine\nover for a meal to have red wine and\nsteak, but you came to my door without\nany explanation, broke into my house,\nand started a killing spree. Tell me,\nshouldn't you compensate me? That's an\ninvitation. You're clearly stealing it.\nI simply made a phone call to invite\nMiss Jasmine over. So, you also use\nthreats. All right, don't worry about\nthese trivial details. Just tell me\nwhether you'll compensate me or not.\nHey, Yong Dong&lt;unk&gt;s face turned ashen.\nAlthough he was a poor student, he\nunderstood the principle of being at the\nmercy of others. Sumu nodded in\nsatisfaction. Given that you're a\npenniless wretch and all you can sell is\nyour body. Working for me for 3 years is\ncompensation. For Sumu, 3 years is\nenough. He can already control Yong\nDoning now, let alone how much his\nmental strength will increase in 3\nyears, provided that he can survive.\nWork for you. Yong Donging&lt;unk&gt;s\nexpression softened slightly. This meant\nthat he would not die for the time\nbeing, and Jasmine would be safe. He\nonly wanted to pretend to agree now and\nwait for an opportunity to take revenge\nlater. Sumu seemed to see through his\nthoughts and said calmly, \"You should\nalso know my abilities. Dealing with an\nordinary person like Jasmine is a piece\nof cake. To be honest, I have already\nplanted a thought in her mind. A thought\nof suicide. If you harbor any evil\nthoughts, Jasmine will commit suicide\nfor me.\" Yong Dona&lt;unk&gt;s expression\nsuddenly changed. \"Bastard, don't hurt\nJasmine. Come at me if you dare.\" \"What\na touching love story!\" Sumu exclaimed.\n\"In that case, you should think even\nmore about Jasmine. She loves you so\nmuch that she even dared to betray me\nfor you. Such a good girl. Her life and\ndeath are in your hands. If you agree to\nwork for me for 3 years, I will set you\nfree after 3 years. Yong Dong&lt;unk&gt;s face\nwas grim and uncertain. He remained\nsilent for a long time before finally\nsaying, \"I promise you, but if you don't\nkeep your promise or hurt Jasmine, I\nswear that even if I'm shattered to\npieces, I will make you pay the price.\"\nSumu smiled slightly. It's a pleasure to\ncooperate with you. At the same time, a\nsubtle glint flashed in the eyes hidden\nbehind the brown glasses. An invisible\nspiritual force began to emanate\nfluctuations. He was using psychological\nsuggestion on Yong Doning to reinforce\nhis thoughts. For Yong Doning at this\npoint, there were two choices. One was\nto believe that he would be free in 3\nyears and then cooperate sincerely. The\nother was not to believe, then to\ncooperate and name only and wait for an\nopportunity to betray him. The effect of\npsychological suggestion is to reinforce\nthe idea of genuine cooperation, making\nYong Doning more inclined to choose the\nfirst option. Who do you want me to\nkill? Your rival. Don't be so violent.\nWho says gang leaders have to kill\npeople? I still love peace and your job\ndoesn't involve killing. That doesn't\nsound like something you would say. Your\nfirst task is to help me enter the\nnightmare world. Yong Donging was\nshocked and remained silent for a long\ntime, leaving aside whether I can do it\nor not. Do you? know what entering the\nnightmare world means. Enough with the\nnonsense. I have my own plans. If I'm\nnot mistaken, the sudden palpitations\nyou felt during class earlier were a\nsign that you were about to enter the\nnightmare world again. Yang Donging\nnodded silently and after a long while\nsaid, \"Nightmare apostles will sense\nwhen they are about to enter the\nnightmare world, and they will usually\nenter 2 to 3 days after the sense is\ngenerated.\" You said before that\nentering the nightmare world is through\nsleeping and dreaming. But what if you\ndon't sleep? Not sleeping can delay the\nonset of sleep. But who can stay awake\nforever? People will die if they don't\nsleep. Sumu did not comment on this.\nThere are even extraordinary people in\nthis world. So it is not unusual for\nsomeone to never sleep. However, Yong\nDoning has only recently come into\ncontact with extraordinary people. So\nhis understanding of the information is\nnaturally limited. When entering the\nnightmare world, does the spirit enter\nwhile the body remains in reality? Or do\nboth the spirit and body enter together?\nYong Donaing shook his head. I don't\nknow either. I've only been to the\nnightmare world once. And who can\nobserve whether their body is lying in\nbed while they're asleep? A slight glint\nappeared in Su Mu&lt;unk&gt;s eyes behind his\nbrown tinted glasses, and a thought\nsuddenly formed in his mind. He wondered\nif his body was still lying in bed\nsleeping when he entered that dream of\ninfinitely increasing spiritual power\neveryday. Verification is also very\nsimple. Just install a camera in the\nbedroom. However, now is not the time to\nverify. Yang Doning continued, \"I feel\nthat the mind and body should enter\ntogether because the nightmare world is\na completely real world. It's like\ntraveling through time. The injuries you\nget inside will also be carried out when\nyou return to reality.\" You just said\nthat we would enter the nightmare world\nin 2 to 3 days. Today should be the\nthird day, right? Yeah, because I didn't\nsleep last night. Otherwise, I probably\nwould have gone in last night. Why\ndidn't you sleep last night? you. Yong\nDonging glared at him instantly. Why the\nhell am I not sleeping? Didn't you make\nme study math all night? A mysterious\nsmile curved Su Mu&lt;unk&gt;s lips. All\nright, don't worry about such trivial\ndetails. Just get ready to cooperate\nwith me as we enter the nightmare world.\nYang Donging frowned immediately. That's\nimpossible. Nightmare world is entered\nrandomly. As far as I know, no one can\nchoose to enter it on their own. Sumu\nsmiled mysteriously. You don't need to\nworry about that. I have my own plans.\nKnight: Inside a luxurious room, a dozen\nor so men in black stood in a neat row\nled by Xiao Xiao Yao. Leader, as you\ninstructed, I have gathered all the\nelites of the Viper Gang, Ziao Xiao Yao\nsaid respectfully. Sumu carefully\nobserved that these people were all\nburly and robust with a faint aura of\nmenace on their faces and their waists\nwere bulging as they carried pistols. At\nthis moment, a bald man with no eyebrows\nand lipstick marks on his face looked\ndisdainful and curled his lip. The\nnightmare world isn't about having a lot\nof people. If you bring these useless\npeople in, they'll just be a burden in\nthe end. Oh, right. That's assuming you\nactually have a way to get that many\npeople in. Chapter 24. Nightmare World.\nThe bald man speaking was Yong Doning.\nSince the two reached an agreement, Sumu\nhad released him. Under the influence of\npsychological suggestion, Yong Dongqing\ndid not cause trouble, but worked\nhonestly, waiting to live happily ever\nafter with Jasmine in three years. As\nfor the lip print on his face, it was\nnaturally Jasmine's. The kid wanted to\nsee Jasmine as soon as he came out. The\ntwo cuddled for a while, and he learned\nfrom Jasmine that his younger brother\nhad become the factory manager, and that\nJasmine herself had been signed by a\nrecord company. This ending can be\ndescribed as a happy one for everyone.\nThe younger brother becomes the factory\nmanager. Jasmine is able to pursue her\ndreams and Sumu also gains a bodyguard\nwho is an extraordinary person. The only\none who suffers is Yong Doning who has\nto be a beast of burden for 3 years.\nSumu ignored him and instead calmly\ninstructed, \"Prepare to go to sleep.\"\nYong Donging walked straight to the only\nbed in the room. Unexpectedly, Sumu\nextended his snakeskin cane and stopped\nhim. Sleep on the ground. Yong\nDonging&lt;unk&gt;s face darkened with anger.\nIsn't there a bed here? Why do I have to\nsleep on the floor? The bed is mine.\nSumu put away his snakeskin cane and\nglanced at him indifferently. Yang\nDoning could only lie on the floor,\ncursing and swearing. At this moment,\nSumu instructed Xiao Xiao Yao and the\nothers, \"You all go to sleep, too. Bang!\nBang! Bang!\" So, men in black lay down\non the ground and fell asleep\nimmediately. Some even started snoring.\nYong Dong&lt;unk&gt;s eyebrows twitched as he\nlooked at them. \"Do these people sleep\nso well?\" Sumu shook his head. It's just\nhypnosis. Do you want to try it? Yong\nDongqing immediately recalled unpleasant\nmemories from the past and refused with\na livid face, then closed her eyes\ntightly. About 10 minutes later, he\nslowly drifted off to sleep. He had been\ndoing math problems all night and was\ncompletely exhausted. Seeing that\neveryone had fallen asleep, Sumu began\nhis own plan. He pulled a dark gold\npocket watch from his pocket. the watch\nhead slipping from his fingertips and\nswinging in the air like a pendulum. 1 2\n3 thump. Sumu collapsed onto the soft\nbed. In the vast and ethereal celestial\npalace, a celestial emperor stood\nproudly, surrounded by celestial energy,\nas if boundless radiance burst forth\nfrom his body. His figure was majestic\nand upright, as if he could support the\nentire sky. And this immortal emperor\nwas none other than Sumu. Yes, he\nentered his dream. Transforming into a\ncelestial emperor was just basic stuff\nfor him. It was a habit he had developed\nsubconsciously. Sumu stood in the void,\nhis magnificent immortal robe fluttering\nin the wind. Embroidered with the stars\nof the heavens. The robe seemed to\ncontain the ultimate truth of the\nuniverse. He slightly raised his hand\nand the immortal power flowing from his\nsleeves transformed into dazzling light\nilluminating the entire dream. Dreams\nhave no walls, which means that dreams\nhave no boundaries. What he needs to do\nnow is expand. Expand the dream\ninfinitely until it connects to Yong\nDoning's dream in his mind. Since he is\nthe master of dreams, why can't he\ncontrol the connection between his own\ndreams and the dreams of others? To be\nable to control the birth and death of\nthe universe with a flick of the wrist\nis merely connecting to a dream. It\nshouldn't be difficult to do. Time\npassed second by second. Sumu slowly\nclosed his eyes, pushing his senses to\nthe limit. His dream expanded wildly\nlike the big bang. Finally, he sensed\nsomething different, a very peculiar\nfeeling, like a celestial emperor\nstanding at the pinnacle, suddenly\nperceiving the barrier of the world. And\nafter his perception penetrated the\nbarrier, he saw another world. In the\ndesolate frontier of dreams, where there\nis only endless darkness, a dozen or so\nstars twinkling with faint light, have\nappeared out of nowhere, mysterious and\nmagnificent. Sumu could clearly sense\nthat those dozen or so stars were not\nfrom his dream because he could\nperfectly control his own dream. So, he\nwas particularly sensitive to anything\nextra. Is this their dream? Sumu opened\nhis eyes. The immortal emperor&lt;unk&gt;'s\ngaze was like a deep and boundless black\nhole in the universe containing the\nbrilliance and dimness of countless\nstars and the flow and change of time.\nWhen his gaze swept across, it was like\na bolt of lightning splitting the\ndarkness of the dreams edge, revealing\nthe dozen or so stars. Even the image\nabove is clearly visible. The images\nappearing on the 12 stars were basically\nthe same. Su Mu sat on a throne with a\ndark mass of people below him shouting,\n\"Long live the leader.\" Clearly, this\nwas Xiao Xiao Yao and the others dream.\nThey were brainwashed every day, and\neven in their dreams, they were thinking\nabout Sumu. Besides these 12 stars,\nthere is another star that looks like it\nwas cast in steel and has a metallic\nsheen. The image displayed on it is\nsomewhat different. The scene is\nsomewhat erotic. The male protagonist is\nYong Donging and the female protagonist\nis Jasmine. The two are deeply in love\nwhen Sumu appears and steals her away.\nThis is Yong Donging&lt;unk&gt;s dream. Sumu\nfrowns slightly. It's so melodramatic.\nIn Yong Donging&lt;unk&gt;s dream, Jasmine has\nbeen successfully taken away by Sumu,\nand the plot is becoming increasingly\nmelodramatic. Jasmine, sorry, Holly, a\nlove triangle is too crowded. Yong\nDonging, no, Jasmine, Jasmine, how can I\nlive without you, Sumu? He was\nspeechless for a moment, and just as he\nwas about to complain, his brows\nfurrowed slightly, and his gaze, sharp\nas lightning, was fixed on Yong\nDong&lt;unk&gt;s dream. Suddenly, a strange\ncrimson color appeared in Yong\nDoning&lt;unk&gt;s dream. That crimson hue,\nlike old rust or dried blood, spread\nsilently through the dream, exuding a\nchilling aura. It was like demon blood\nseeping from the depths of hell, thick\nand flowing slowly. Each drop filled\nwith endless pain and resentment. Yong\nDong&lt;unk&gt;s dream was gradually covered\nin blood. And at the same time, the star\nrepresenting his dream began to shake\nviolently as if it was about to be\npulled from the world at any moment. Is\nthis the summoning from the nightmare\nworld? Sumu narrowed his eyes slightly.\nWithout further hesitation, he\nimmediately manipulated his own dream to\nconnect with Yong Doning&lt;unk&gt;s dream.\nThe moment the two made contact, his\nbody jolted violently. The celestial\npalace, which was originally shrouded in\nethereal beauty, was somehow stained\nwith a strange crimson color. The\ncrimson color spread like wildfire, like\na virus. He tried to control the crimson\ncolor, but found that he couldn't\ncontrol it at all. Even though he was\nthe supreme immortal emperor in his\ndream, everything was like a mirage to\nthe crimson color. Only the crimson\ncolor was real. The feeling is like that\nof a supreme powerhouse in a novel,\ncapable of destroying the world with a\nmere gesture, yet unable to escape the\nnovel and harm a single blade of grass\nor tree in reality. Chapter 25. Just as\nI expected, the nightmare world pulls\npeople in through dreams. As long as my\ndream is connected to that of the\nnightmare apostle, I will be pulled into\nit as well. Sumu's eyes flashed and at\nsome point a strange blood red color\nappeared in his eyes. In that case, I\ncan use the same principle to bring that\nother person and the others into it as\nwell. Sumu manipulated his own dream,\nconnecting it with the dreams of Xiao\nXiao Yao and others. When all the dreams\nwere connected, it seemed to provide a\nchannel for the spread of blood. It\nspread infinitely, eventually staining\neveryone's dreams with blood. That\ncrimson expanse was like a giant net,\nenveloping everyone's dreams, leaving\nthem nowhere to escape. It was as if\nonce trapped within it, they would be\nswallowed by endless fear and despair.\nAnd this is exactly what Sumu wanted. He\nsat enthroned on the highest throne, his\ndark gold star- patterned robes now\nstained crimson with blood. The blood\nraged wildly, gradually forming a sea of\nblood that slowly engulfed him, abdomen,\nchest, neck. At this moment, Sumu was\ncompletely enveloped in a sea of blood\nwith only his head remaining. A\nsuppressed smile appeared on his pale\nface. This is truly something to look\nforward to. As soon as he finished\nspeaking, the sea of blood completely\nengulfed him. The pitch black night\nenveloped Xiao family village, making\nthe entire village exceptionally\ndesolate. There were no lights in any of\nthe houses except for a few flickering\ncandle light in a two-story house which\nstood out conspicuously in the darkness.\nAs night fell, the two-story house\nseemed to be covered by a thick layer of\ndarkness. Eerie vines climbed the\nmodeled walls, and the rusty iron door\ncreaked eerily in the breeze as if it\nwere groaning in pain. Inside the house,\nfour men and one woman sat anxiously\naround a candle, glancing back at the\ndarkness not reached by the candle\nlight, as if some terrifying monster\nmight appear at any moment. \"It's\nalready dark. We'll go out to find food\nand candles as planned.\" A man in his\nearly 20s with a buzz cut said in a deep\nvoice. Although his expression was\nsolemn, he did not show the fear or\nanxiety of the others. \"Brother ye, are\nwe really going out? What if there are\nnightmare monsters outside?\" A slightly\ntrembling voice came from a middle-aged\nman. He was wearing faded work clothes\nand worn out rubber shoes. His skin was\ndark and his figure was slightly\nhunched. Marks left by long-term heavy\nphysical labor. The man with the buzzcut\nsurnamed E gave him a cold look. What\ncan we do if we don't go out? Wait to\ndie. We've been here for 3 days and we\nhaven't eaten a single thing in three\nwhole days. If this continues, we'll\nstarve to death without those nightmare\nmonsters even lifting a finger. and the\ncandles are almost gone. Once we run out\nof candles, I don't need to tell you\nwhat the consequences will be, do I? The\nmiddle-aged man shrank back in fear and\ndidn't dare to say anything more. While\nthe others remained silent at this\nmoment, the man surnamed you stood up\nand said, \"Everyone split up and go into\nthe village to find food. It's nighttime\nnow, so those humanoid monsters won't\nappear. Just be careful of the shadowy\nfigures. Also, bring all the food you\nfind back, and I'll distribute it.\nAnyone who dares to hoard food will be\ndealt with rudely. After saying that, he\ntook the lead and prepared to leave\nwhile the only woman among them quickly\ngrabbed the hand of the man's surname\nYei. Her pretty face showing a pitiful\npleading look. Brother Ye, I I'm scared.\nCan I come with you? The woman was\nwearing a thin silk night gown that\nsubtly outlined her graceful curves. The\nneckline was slightly open, revealing a\nglimpse of fair skin and a sexy collar\nbone. The slender shoulder straps hung\nlightly on her rounded shoulders as if\nthey might slip off at any moment. Her\npitiful appearance made the others\nsecretly swallow their saliva, their\nprotective instincts surging. However,\nthe man surnamed you remained\nexpressionless and coldly refused,\nsaying, \"I said we&lt;unk&gt;ll split up. The\nmore people there are, the more likely\nwe are to attract the attention of the\nshadowy figure.\" The woman persisted,\nbiting her delicate lips as she pleaded.\nPlease, brother Ye. You're the only\nsuperhuman in the team. Only you can\nprotect me. Please take me with you. I\nI'll do anything. The man surnamed Ye\nsneered, a hint of mockery appearing in\nhis eyes and ruthlessly shook off the\nwoman's hand. Since you know I am a\nsuperhuman, you should also understand\nthat there are plenty of people like you\naround me. In the real world, it\nwouldn't matter, but this is the\nnightmare world. I can barely protect\nmyself, let alone you. You think you can\ndo anything? Then go and take down the\nshadowy figure lurking in the darkness.\nIf you do that, I'll protect you 24/7.\"\nThe woman's face turned pale instantly,\nas if all her strength had been drained\naway. The man surnamed Ye gave her a\ncold look, then picked up the lantern,\nturned, and left, his figure\ndisappearing into the darkness. The\ndesperate woman could only cast her\nhelpless gaze at the others, but no one\nresponded. The others weren't fools\neither. None of them wanted to take a\nburden. They all took their lanterns and\nleft one after another. Only the\nmiddle-aged man hesitated for a long\ntime before finally saying, \"Ew, come\nwith me. It'll be good to have someone\nto look after you.\" A look of joy\nappeared on the woman's face, and she\nquickly nodded in agreement. Her\nslender, fair arms wrapped tightly\naround the middle-aged man's arms, and\nthe two picked up the lanterns and left\nthe house. The two walked cautiously in\nthe darkness, their white paper lanterns\ncasting a faint candle light. Their\nbodies were pressed close together, and\nthey could even hear each other's\nheartbeats clearly. After an unknown\namount of time, a woman's voice rang out\nin the darkness. Uncle Lee, do you think\nwe can get back alive? Lie Chong's body\nstiffened slightly, but he still managed\nto offer a comforting words. Miss Wong,\njust call me Lily. Uncle Lee, you're a\ngood person. You're different from them.\nLily, we will definitely make it back\nalive. Li Chong felt a warmth in his\nheart, and at the same time, the arms\nwrapped around his arm tightened even\nmore. That soft touch slightly dispelled\nthe fear in my heart. But just then,\nclick. Inside the village, the sound of\na tree branch snapping suddenly rang out\nfrom an alleyway beside the two people.\nIt sounded like someone had stepped on a\ndry branch on the ground. The two men's\nexpressions changed instantly. They\nturned around abruptly, raised their\nlanterns, and shown them into the alley.\nIt was pitch black inside, a dark abyss\nthat seemed to be silently swallowing\neverything. \"Who? Who's there?\" Li Chong\nasked an alarm. \"Is it Brother Yi or\nWong Tao?\" In the dim candle light, a\nfigure seemed to be standing quietly in\nthe dark alley without making any\nmovement. The figure was thin and tall.\nLi Chong mustered his courage and raised\nthe lantern, trying to see the man's\nface clearly. Then the figure moved. It\nseemed as if he had taken a step\nforward, deliberately stepping into the\nrange of candlelight. Countless shadows\nreceded from the person's face like tiny\nworms, revealing a pale face. He had\ndelicate and handsome features, were\nhigh in brown glasses, and wore a polite\nyet elegant smile. His pale skin even\nshown brightly in the candle light.\nChapter 26. Do I look like a monster? H.\nLily was the first to let out a\nhigh-pitched scream because the face did\nnot belong to any of their group. Li\nChong was instantly gripped by fear. His\nmind was a complete mess. Why didn't\nbrother Yi say that the humanoid monster\nonly appeared during the day? Before he\ncould react, he suddenly felt a pair of\nsoft hands push him hard. Caught off\nguard, Li Chong fell to the ground. The\nowner of those hands fled as if he had\ngone mad. Lily knew very well that she\nwas no match for the humanoid monster,\nnor could she outrun Li Chong beside\nher. To survive and avoid being eaten,\nshe could only have Li Chong by her\ntime. Snap! Lantern rolled with inertia\nto the feet of the pale-faced man,\nilluminating the scenery behind him.\n\"People, people everywhere.\" Behind the\npale white face stood rows of men in\nblack, motionless like zombies, filling\nthe dark alley. \"Uh uh! Monster, don't\neat me.\" Li Chong's fragile mind was\nseverely impacted. He collapsed as he\nscrambled to his feet, fell down, and\ngot up again, practically crawling and\ntumbling as he fled into the distance.\nSumu pushed up his brown glasses with a\nbit of helplessness. He hadn't expected\nthat he would be mistaken for a monster\nby others when he first arrived in the\nnightmare world and hadn't even seen a\nnightmare monster yet. After he was\ncompletely swallowed by a sea of blood\nin his dream, he came to this village.\nThis dilapidated village didn't even\nhave lights. Most importantly, all the\nlighting tools he had were\nmalfunctioning. To be precise, they\nweren't malfunctioning. They were still\nworking, but the light they emitted was\ncompletely unable to dispel the darkness\nof this world. Sumu turned around and\nasked his group of underlings, \"Do I\nlook like a monster?\" Xiao Xiao stared\nmenacingly at Li Chong&lt;unk&gt;s retreating\nfigure. \"How dare he insult the leader?\"\n\"I&lt;unk&gt;ll go kill him,\" Yong Dongching\nsaid thoughtfully. \"It seems that this\nperson should also be a nightmare\napostle. He should have entered before\nus.\" so he might know some information\nabout this nightmare. Sumu waved his\nhand. Grab him. Yes, chief. Two burly\nmen in black leaped out like cheetahs\nand charged straight at Li Chong. A few\nseconds later, a panicked Li Chong was\ndragged back by two burly men in black\nlike a dead dog, \"No, don't eat me.\nPlease don't eat me.\" Li Chong didn't\ndare to open his eyes and struggled and\nshouted wildly. After struggling for a\nwhile, he realized that no one was\nattacking him at all. He was stunned and\ncautiously opened his eyes only to see\nthe same pale and handsome face from\nbefore. The owner of that face was\nsmiling, a very gentle smile that was\nnot at all aggressive. \"Sir, are you\nalso a nightmare apostle?\" Sumu asked\npolitely. Li Chong nodded\nsubconsciously, then suddenly realized\nsomething. \"You guys, too?\" \"Yes, we are\njust like you. People who have strayed\ninto the nightmare world, not monsters.\nReally?\" Li Chong looked at the large\ngroup of men in black in front of him\nwith some skepticism. But why are there\nso many of you? And why are you all\nwearing the same clothes? Could it be\nthat you came as a group? A vein bulged\non Xiao Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s face as he grabbed Li\nChong by the collar and said fiercely.\nYou think this is a group tour? Do you\nthink we're here for a vacation? Answer\nour leader questions honestly.\nUnderstand? Hey, how many times have I\ntold you not to be so violent, to be\npolite? Yes, Chief. Xiao Xiao released\nLi Chong&lt;unk&gt;s collar and then stepped\nback behind Sumu. Sumu smiled at the\npanicked Li Chong and even kindly\nstraightened his wrinkled collar. Don't\nbe nervous. After all, we're not bad\npeople. By the way, do you know how I\nshould address you, Lee? Lie Chong? Lie\nChong said, trembling. For some reason,\nhe was even more afraid. All right, Mr.\nLi Chong, we are both nightmare apostles\ntrapped in this terrifying dream.\nShouldn't we help each other? After all,\nindividual strength is limited. Only by\nuniting as one can we overcome this\ndifficulty. Don't you agree? Behind the\nbrown tinted glasses, a faint, eerie\nlight emanated from the eyes. Under the\ngaze of those eyes, Li Chong&lt;unk&gt;s fear\ngradually subsided. You're right. We\nshould help each other, Li Chong said\nearnestly. Mr. Li Chong is a very nice\nperson. Please tell me the information\nyou have. As the two interacted\namicably, Yong Dongqing, who was\nstanding to the side, felt a chill run\ndown his spine upon witnessing this\nscene. No matter how many times he saw\nthis method of controlling people's\nhearts, he would feel a deep fear and\napprehension. As Li Chong recounted his\nexperiences without reservation, Sumu\nfinally understood the nightmare he was\ncurrently experiencing. Li Chong&lt;unk&gt;s\ngroup consisted of 10 people, five of\nwhom had already died, leaving four men\nand one woman. They had all entered the\nnightmare world 3 days prior. But unlike\nthe rest of them who had entered\ntogether, these individuals had entered\nindividually. Of the remaining people,\nonly one young man named Yanu was a\nsuperhuman who had entered the nightmare\nworld for the third time. The rest were\nordinary people who were entering for\nthe first time. Upon entering, they\nfound themselves in a village called\nXiao Family Village. At night, the\nvillage was deserted, but a monster\ncalled the shadow lurked in the\ndarkness, reaching out its hand to pull\npeople into the darkness. It was said\nthat anyone pulled into it was certain\nto die. The daytime is even more\ndangerous, as the vanished villagers\nwill reappear during the day. To be\nprecise, they are not villagers at all,\nbut monsters in human skin. They are\nincredibly strong and difficult to kill,\nand they will actively attack humans.\nOnce they capture a human, they will\ncruy torture and eat them. There are\nover a hundred of these monsters, making\nthem impossible to deal with head-on.\nThey can only hide inside houses. The\nvillagers seem to have a natural fear of\nhouses. As long as the doors and windows\nare closed, they cannot break in.\nHowever, these monsters can bewitch\npeople and will try every means to lure\nthem out of their rooms. After hearing\nLi Chongs description, Sum Mu&lt;unk&gt;s\nsmile widened. I'm starting to look\nforward to it a little. Chapter 27.\nMisunderstanding. It seems there are\nadvantages to entering the nightmare\nworld late. At least some good people\nhave already risked their lives to help\nyou obtain a lot of crucial information.\nFor example, villagers cannot force\ntheir way into houses, and the shadowy\nfigure likes to appear in crowded\nplaces. This kind of information may\nseem like just a single sentence, but to\nactually know it, you have to risk your\nlife. Although the lives of the Viper\ngangs underlings are not\nlife-threatening, recruiting and\nhypnotizing a new batch of underlings is\nstill very time-consuming. \"Mr. Li\nChong, please lead us to meet up with\neveryone now.\" Sum Mu said with a smile.\nLi Chong nodded numbly. \"Okay.\" \"Inside\na two-story house.\" Yiu and the others\nreturned one after another. The three of\nthem exchanged glances, their faces all\nlooking grim. Xiao Yang Wong Tao, did\nyou two also fail to find any food?\nEphanu asked. The two shook their heads.\nI went to look in the field, but there\nwere no crops at all. I searched the\nvillage's trash cans, but there was no\nfood. Eion's expression grew\nincreasingly grim, but he did not\nreadily believe what the two said. He\nfirst carefully examined the two men and\nthen reached out to touch their shrunken\nbellies. You two open your mouths. The\ntwo were terrified of Yianu and obeyed\nhis orders. Eionu checked and found no\nfood residue. He even smelled it and\nfound no food aroma, only the stench of\nnot brushing teeth for 3 days. It seems\nwe can only pin our hopes on Li Chong\nand Wongly. The three of them, each\nholding a lantern, sat in a corner of\nthe room, far apart from each other. Not\nlong after, a series of hurried\nfootsteps came from outside the house.\nOpened the door. Loud banging on the\ndoor, and Wong Le's terrified cries for\nhelp rang out from outside, particularly\njarring. In the quiet night, the three\nmen's expressions changed and they all\nstood up. Yionu rushed to the door\nfirst, but he didn't open it\nimmediately. Instead, he asked, \"What\nhappened?\" \"Leong Li Chong has\nencountered a humanoid monster. Please\nopen the door quickly.\" Wong Le's once\nsweet voice was now distorted, and the\nfear that had been building up for 3\ndays burst forth. Yiu&lt;unk&gt;s expression\nsuddenly changed. \"Impossible! Humanoid\nmonsters only appear during the day.\nIt's nighttime now. How could they come\nout? To confirm the time, he even went\nto the window and looked outside. It was\npitch black outside with only the cold\nmoonlight hanging down from the sky,\nshining on the surrounding tree branches\nand casting eerie, distorted shadows on\nthe ground, exuding a suffocating and\nsinister atmosphere. I don't know\neither, but they just appeared. Not just\none, but many monsters. They filled the\nalley. Wongley cried out in terror, her\nvoice choked with sobs. Eanu didn't\nreply. Instead, he pressed himself\nagainst the window, carefully observing\nthe doorway. Only after confirming that\nWong Le was alone at the door, did he\nspeak. \"Since there are so many\nnightmare monsters, how did you manage\nto come back alive? Where is Lie Chong?\"\nWong Le sobs paused. \"Leong He stayed\nbehind to cover my retreat.\" He So, so\nbang. The door to the house was opened,\nand the faint candle light shining from\ninside shone on Wong Le's delicate body,\ncasting a halo around her silhouette.\nHer white silk night gown was covered in\nmud, and her long bare legs had several\nabrasions. One of her fluffy slippers\nwas missing, and her once smooth feet\nwere now stained with mud, with even the\nspaces between her toes filled with a\nblack substance. She rushed into the\nroom and only breathed a sigh of relief\nwhen she was enveloped in candle light.\nBang! Without a second hesitation, Eion\nclosed the door. Then without giving\nWong Le a chance to catch her breath,\nEphanu grabbed her hand and said\nurgently, \"Tell me quickly what exactly\nhappened.\" He was indeed very anxious\nbecause Wong Le's words meant that the\npatterns of the nightmare monsters\nactivity observed over the past 3 days\nwere wrong or had changed, which\nconcerned everyone's lives. \"I I don't\nknow. I'm so scared.\" Li Chong and I\nwere looking for food when we passed\nthrough an alley and suddenly heard a\nnoise. Li Chong thought it was you, so\nhe took a lantern to shine on it. And\nthen and then Wong Le's breathing became\nmore and more rapid, and her pupils\ninvoluntarily contracted as if she had\nthought of something terrible. What\nhappened? Tell me the truth. Yanu&lt;unk&gt;s\nface was contorted with rage, and he\nwanted nothing more than to slap her.\nPeople, people everywhere. The alley was\nfilled with rows of men in black. They\nwere motionless, like like zombies. The\none in the lead was deathly pale without\na trace of color and he seemed to be\nwearing brown tinted glasses. Brown\nglasses? That's right. It's the guy with\nthe brown glasses. He kept smiling. He\njust watched us quietly and kept\nsmiling. Upon hearing this, everyone\nfelt a chill run down their spines.\nUnconsciously, images flashed through\ntheir minds. A pitch black night. White\nlanterns illuminating the alleyway. And\nin the candle light, rows of zombie-like\nfigures in black came into view. Their\npale faces staring straight at you with\nsmiles. Bang! Bang! Bang! A series of\ncrisp knocks on the door startled\neveryone awake. \"Open the door quickly.\nIt's me, Li Chong.\" Li Chong&lt;unk&gt;s voice\ncame from outside the door. \"Whoosh!\"\nturned pale instantly, and Wong Le was\nso frightened that she hugged Eionu\ntightly, seemingly seeking comfort. \"Go\nto hell. Get out of here. Don't touch\nme.\" Yonu shoved Wong Lee away, his face\ndark and uncertain. Open the door. I can\nsee light inside. Li Chong kept urging.\nXiao Gang swallowed nervously. Didn't\nWong Le say Li Chong was dead? Then\nwho's outside the door? The room was\ndeathly silent. No one answered the\nquestion. It's&lt;unk&gt; possible that the\nvillagers have changed. Don't forget\nthey have the ability to alter their\nappearance and bewitch people. Wong Tao\nsaid cautiously. Shut up. Don't make a\nsound. I'm going to take a look. Yonu\nshouted in a low voice, took a step, and\nsilently approached the window. He took\none look and his heart skipped a beat.\nThe scene outside was exactly as Wong\nLee had described. Li Chong was knocking\non the door and behind him stood a row\nof men in black. The people stood\nexpressionless like statues while the\nman in the lead wore brown glasses and\nheld a snake patterned wooden cane in\nhis hand. Suddenly, the man with the\nbrown glasses seemed to notice something\nand turned his head slightly to look\nover. When their eyes met, the man with\nbrown glasses gave a polite smile. Tong.\nYionu felt a chill run down his spine\nand quickly moved away from the window,\npressing himself against the wall to\navoid that gaze. Damn it. How did so\nmany nightmare monsters suddenly appear?\nChapter 28. Who do you think you are?\nEveryone immediately scatter to the\ncorners and hide. Cover your ears and no\nmatter what anyone says outside, do not\nopen the door. Without Yanu even giving\nany instructions, the others had already\nfound their places, crouching in the\ncorners with their hands behind their\nheads, trembling with fear. Over the\npast 3 days, they have experienced this\nkind of incident many times. Basically,\nas soon as it gets daytime, they are\nbesieged by swarms of villagers. These\nvillagers can change all sorts of ways\nand can even pretend to be your\nrelatives to lure you into opening the\ndoor. Therefore, the best solution is to\nnot look, not listen, and not respond.\nOutside the door, Li Chong knocked on\nthe door for a long time, but no one\nanswered. Strange. What's wrong with\nthem? Why won't they open the door?\nThere are clearly people inside. It must\nbe a misunderstanding. Sumu roughly\nguessed what the people inside were\nthinking. He looked back at the rows of\nzombies behind him. Indeed, after being\nchased by humanoid monsters for 3 days\nin the nightmare world, it was\nunderstandable to be afraid when\nsuddenly seeing a group of people in\nblack like this. Especially since these\nmen in black were all hypnotized with\nonly one thought in their minds. To\nserve their leader, they had no concept\nof fear, making them seem somewhat out\nof place. Chief, I'll break down the\ndoor. Ziao Xaya volunteered. Go ahead.\nSumu nodded. But then Yong Doning\nstepped forward. No need. I'll talk to\nthem. Bumping into the door rashly could\ncause misunderstandings. With that, Yong\nDoning walked to the door and said\nloudly, \"Don't misunderstand. We are not\nnightmare monsters, but nightmare\napostles just like you. Only we entered\n3 days later. I am a superhuman. Open\nthe door and discuss how to cooperate to\nget through this nightmare.\" Silence. A\ndeathly silence with no one responding\nfrom inside the room. Yang Daing bang.\nHe kicked the door open and the\ndilapitated iron door slammed. heavily\nonto the ground with a piercing metallic\nclang. The moment the door opened, Yong\nDonging was greeted by a flame as big as\na bullet. The fiery bullet streked\nacross the sky, scorching and distorting\nthe air in its path, leaving a long\nblazing trail in the dark night sky.\nYong Dona&lt;unk&gt;s expression changed\ndrastically. He had no time to dodge and\nhad to reach out to catch it head-on. A\nsteely color appeared on his palm. Boom!\nA violent burst of flames erupted. And\nin that blaze, Yang Doning was sent\nflying backward as if hit head-on by a\ncannonball, his palms charred black.\nFrom inside the room came Yiani Fongu\nsurprised and doubtful voice. Iron\nHeart, you're really a superhum. At this\nmoment, he was making a gun shape with\none hand with his index finger and thumb\nraised and the other three fingers\nfolded up much like a child imitating a\ngun with his hand making a beep beep\nbeep sound. However, a blazing flame was\nburning at the tip of his index finger,\nwhich appeared unusually bright in the\ndim room. Damn it. Yang Doning scrambled\nto his feet, yelling angrily. Didn't I\njust say we're not nightmare monsters.\nMisunderstanding. Misunderstanding.\nYanu&lt;unk&gt;s face showed surprise, but his\nright hand was still in the position of\na pistol, and the flame at his\nfingertips had not dissipated. You don't\nknow this, but there are many monsters\nin this nightmare disguised as humans.\nThey will try every means to trick us\ninto opening the door. So, I can't\nbelieve it. However, the ability you\njust used was indeed Iron Will, and\nthose monsters couldn't break through\ndoors and windows. My reaction before\nwas purely instinctive. But now, I'm\ncertain you're a superhuman, not a\nnightmare monster. Yang Doning patted\nthe dust off his clothes, his expression\nsoftening slightly. Then, Yion&lt;unk&gt;s\ngaze swept over Su Mu and the others,\nhis expression wary. Although I can\nconfirm that you are not a nightmare\nmonster. What about them? Why are they\nwearing the same clothes? Sumu leaning\non his snake patterned wooden cane took\na small step forward and smiled. What do\nnightmare apostles have requirements\nregarding attire? It's not that there\nare requirements for the attire, but all\nthe nightmare apostles enter alone, and\nthe nightmare they encounter each time\nis random. You guys look like you're\nfrom the same organization. Since when\ncan nightmare apostles form teams? Don't\ntell me you formed an organization after\nentering and even prepared your outfits\nin advance. You'd better give me a\nreasonable explanation or I'll have to\nsuspect that you're not human at all,\nbut nightmare monsters. Eionu held his\nright hand with his left, aiming\nintently at Sumu and the others. If it\nweren't for the flame between his index\nfingers, the scene would have been quite\ncomical. Sumu narrowed his eyes\nslightly, and he had a guess in his\nmind. It seemed that the nightmare\napostle's entry into the nightmare world\nwas just like matchmaking in a game.\nEach time he would encounter a different\nteammate, and he could only cue solo and\ncould not enter in a team. This is\nprecisely why Eionu became wary. How\nshould I lie to him? Sumu could never\nreveal that he used dreams to bring\neveryone into the same nightmare. Of\ncourse, even if he did, the other party\nprobably wouldn't believe him. Then,\na faint smile playing on his lips. A\nvery reasonable question, but I can't\nhelp but ask, \"Mr. Yei, who do you think\nyou are? Do you think you're worthy of\nmy explanation?\" \"Click, click.\" The\nsound of countless pistols being cocked\nrang out. More than a dozen dark pistols\nwere pointed at Eion. Whoosh! Yionu\nbroke out in a cold sweat. The flame on\nhis index finger nearly went out, and\nthe stiff feeling of being pointed at\nwith a gun surged through his entire\nbody. He is indeed a superhuman, but he\ndoesn't have a body of steel. being\npointed at with a dozen guns at such\nclose range, he is bound to die. He was\nespecially terrified after seeing the\nlook in the eyes of those armed men. The\nrows of men in black stood ramrod\nstraight like statues, all\nexpressionless, their eyes filled with\ncoldness, their muscles taught, ready to\npull the trigger at any moment. The\nfaint moonlight cast shadows on their\nfaces, making their expressions appear\neven more chilling and terrifying.\nChapter 29. Bronze Laws five-finger\nflame bullet. Is Mr. Are you satisfied\nwith my explanation? Sumu&lt;unk&gt;s gentle\nvoice rang out. Yionu froze, not daring\nto move. Sumu smiled. The reason he\nacted this way was because he was\ncertain that Yianu could not withstand\nbullets. He had already learned about\nthe strength of those humanoid monsters\nand Yianu&lt;unk&gt;s performance when hunting\nthem from Li Chong. Those humanoid\nmonsters are several times stronger than\nordinary people and have extremely\nstrong regenerative abilities. Even if\ntheir heads are blown off, they are hard\nto kill. This level of strength is\nnaturally overwhelming against ordinary\npeople. However, if they were to face\nYong Donging in a one-on-one fight, Yong\nDonging would definitely win. It's just\na pity that the humanoid monsters rarely\nact alone. They usually send out\nhundreds of them at a time. Yionu also\nfought the humanoid monsters several\ntimes in the past 3 days. He only dared\nto fire from a distance, using his\nfingertips to shoot fire bullets. He\ndidn't dare to let the humanoid monster\nget close. Once it got close, he would\nturn around and run away. It can be said\nthat they spent most of the time hiding\nin the house during these three days.\nTherefore, it can be seen that\nYion&lt;unk&gt;s extraordinary power should be\nrelated to fire, and he does not have\nYong Dona&lt;unk&gt;s bulletproof defense. The\ntense standoff lasted for a moment when\nYion suddenly put away the flame at his\nfingertips and forced a smile, saying,\n\"I was being presumptuous. Those\nhumanoid monsters don't have pistols.\nSir, please don't take offense. I didn't\nmean anything by it. I'm just a very\nstraightforward person and not good at\nexpressing myself. The main reason is\nthat I've been feeling too stressed in\nthe nightmare world these past few days\nand my mind has been a bit tense. Now\nthat I think about it carefully, if you\nwere a nightmare monster, you would have\nkilled us all the moment the door\nopened. If I'm not mistaken, you must\nalso be a superhuman. Your superhuman\nabilities are likely related to puppets\nor something similar. These people are\nprobably puppets you control, which is\nwhy they were able to enter the\nnightmare world together. Sumu smiled\nslightly, and without making any move,\nhe simply tapped the ground lightly with\nhis cane. The dozen or so men in black\nuniformly put away their pistols and\ncontinued to stand in place like\nstatues. This is the importance of\nstrength. When you have strength,\neverything unreasonable will be\nexplained reasonably, and extraordinary\npeople will defend you. That's how it is\nnow. You don't even need to make up a\nreason. They've already found one for\nyou. Sumu walked over and gently patted\nYiong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s stiff shoulder, smiling\nwarmly. I didn't expect you to see that.\nIt seems Mr. Yi has exceptional insight.\nYiu chuckled dryly, glancing\noccasionally at Su Mu&lt;unk&gt;s hand on his\nshoulder, as if afraid the other party\nmight suddenly make a move. May I ask\nyour name? My name is Sumu. It is an\nhonor to share this nightmare with Mr.\nYi. Yeonu hurriedly said in a flustered\nmanner, you're too kind. It's my honor.\nWith two extraordinary individuals\njoining us, the chances of successfully\nsurviving this nightmare have increased\ndramatically. Wong Lee and the others\nwatched the scene unfold with strange\nexpressions. They had spent 3 days with\nEuanu and knew very well what kind of\nperson he was. Arrogant, selfish, and\nruthless. But when he encountered\nsomeone stronger than him, all these\ndistinct traits turned into gentleness,\nhumility, and politeness. Afterwards,\neveryone exchanged pleasantries and\nintroduced themselves to each other, and\nthe atmosphere was very pleasant and\nharmonious. However, there were two\npeople who did not get along well. Li\nChong and Wong Le. The honest looking\nmiddle-aged man kept glancing at Wong\nLee, seemingly wanting to say something,\nbut holding back. Wong felt a chill run\ndown her spine. She had already made up\nher mind that if Li Chong dared to\nreport what she had just done, she would\nimmediately turn the tables on him.\nHowever, Li Chong said nothing in the\nend, as if nothing had happened. After a\nbrief exchange of pleasantries, Ephanu\nspoke up. Mr. Su and Mr. Yang entered 3\ndays late, so they probably don't know\nmuch about this nightmare yet. How about\nI explain it to them? Sumu shook his\nhead. No need. I've already heard some\nof the information from Mr. Li Chong. I\nwonder what Mr. Ya&lt;unk&gt;s plans are next.\nYionu quickly replied, \"I originally\nplanned to find a house to guard until\nthe nightmare naturally ends and we\nreturn to reality. After all, most\nnightmare apostles do this. But now that\nthere are two of you extraordinary\nbeings, we can change our strategy. We\ncan try to explore and maybe we can\nbreak this nightmare.\" Sumu's eyes\nflickered slightly. He had already\nlearned some common knowledge about the\nnightmare world from Yong Doning. The\nnightmare world is called a nightmare\nand naturally one can wake up from it.\nNormally, most nightmare apostles choose\nthis path, find a safe place, and lie\nlow for about 7 days before waking up\nfrom the nightmare and returning to\nreality, provided they don't die within\nthose 7 days. However, this method\ncannot be used indefinitely. It is said\nthat the more times one enters the\nnightmare world, the longer it will take\nto wake up, possibly 7 days, 10 days, a\nmonth, or even half a year. Perhaps in\nthe end, one will never wake up again\nunless the nightmare is broken.\nOtherwise, one will remain in the\nnightmare world forever. Therefore, if\nyou encounter a simple nightmare, it's\nbest to try to break free from it. At\nthis moment, Eonu added, \"If we're\nlucky, we might be able to find one or\ntwo treasures.\" Behind the brown tinted\nglasses, he glanced at Yong Donging and\nnoticed that the other person was also\nslightly confused, clearly not knowing\nwhat the treasure was. So, Sumu followed\nup by saying, \"Yes, a treasure is a good\nthing. I was once fortunate enough to\npossess one, but unfortunately I lost it\nfor some reason. A look of regret\nappeared on Sumu&lt;unk&gt;s face. That's such\na pity, Yion said with regret. Even the\nlowest ranking bronze level first tier\ntreasure can fetch at least 5 million in\nthe black market for superhumans.\nHowever, generally no one will sell it.\nTreasures possess superhuman power and\nsignificantly enhance the combat\nstrength of superhumans. Unless they are\nreally short of money, who would be\nwilling to sell it? If I had a defensive\nnoble fantasm, even if it was only\nbronze tier one, with my bronze law,\nfive fingers flame bullet, I wouldn't be\nstuck in my room with nightmare monsters\nall day long. He didn't hide his\nabilities, mainly because he felt there\nwas no need to. Although the five\nfingers flame bullet wasn't as common as\nthe iron heart, it wasn't a rare ability\neither, and he had already used it once\nbefore. Any superhum with a little\nknowledge could basically guess it. By\nthe way, Mr. Sue, what level of treasure\ndid you lose? Sigh. These are all sad\nthings. Let's not talk about them\nanymore. Sumu seemed a little sad, as if\nhe didn't want to bring it up again.\nEionu couldn't be so lacking in\nemotional intelligence that he had to\nask. That's true. Let's not talk about\nit anymore. Let's think about how to get\nthrough the current difficulties. Mr.\nSue, in my opinion, we definitely can't\nstay in this two-story house because the\ndoor has been damaged. The houses in the\nvillage were ordinary dwellings, easily\ndestroyed. Yet, strangely enough, they\ncould withstand the immensely strong\nhumanoid monsters. The immediate\npriority was to find a house large\nenough to house everyone along with food\nand candles before dawn and the monsters\nappeared. Chapter 30. The sound of one\nperson's footsteps is missing. Sumu\nfrowned slightly. A house that can\naccommodate everyone. Wouldn't a large\ncrowd attract the shadowy figures?\nIndeed, gatherings of people increase\nthe probability of attracting the\nshadow, but it's not impossible for a\nlone person to be targeted by it. The\nshadow is practically indestructible.\nThere are only two ways to stop it. The\nfirst is with a candle. As long as you\nplace yourself in light, the shadow\ncannot attack. As for the second method,\nYeon suddenly lowered his voice and\nwhispered, \"Sacrifice someone else.\" The\nshadow has a characteristic. Once it\ntargets someone, it will follow them\nrelentlessly and cause the candle to\nburn faster because the shadow is\nconsuming light. At this point, the only\nway to stop the shadow from following\nyou is to have someone else captured by\nit. Sumu immediately understood why\nEupion had always brought these ordinary\npeople with him. They were acting as a\nshield. If he were alone, he would be\ndoomed if the shadowy figure targeted\nhim. Even a candle eventually runs out\nof power. He also understood why Eionu\nhad told him this news. His side also\nincluded many ordinary people, and Yionu\nconsidered him a superhuman, intending\nto join forces to fight the nightmare\nmonster. Ordinary people here are simply\nused as consumables. I see. Then let's\ndo as you say. Sumu nodded in agreement.\nThe two decided on the next arrangements\nin just a few words without asking for\nanyone else's opinion. Ordinary people\nhave no say in front of superhumans. The\ngroup quickly set off and went outside,\none after another, into the darkness.\nThe darkness surged like a tide,\ncovering their figures, with only the\nwhite paper lanterns in their hands,\nemitting a faint candle light. The group\nwalked slowly and carefully, the only\nsounds in the darkness being the dense\nfootsteps and some tense breathing.\nBefore they had gone very far, Sumu in\nthe group suddenly stopped. Yianu and\nYang Doning, who were standing nearby,\nnoticed Su&lt;unk&gt;s unusual behavior and\nstopped immediately. \"Mr. Su, what's\nwrong?\" Yion asked in a low voice. No,\nSumu replied calmly. The extraordinary\nmental strength made him sense something\nwas off. Yionu felt inexplicably uneasy.\nWhat's wrong? The footsteps sounded\nwrong. Footsteps? Not bad. One person's\nfootsteps are missing. A smile of\ninterest appeared on Su Mu&lt;unk&gt;s pale\nface, which looked somewhat eerie in the\ndarkness. What? Everyone was immediately\nshocked. He turned around, his eyes\nnarrowed, and carefully counted the\nnumber of people. The men in black stood\nlike statues. Hey, you. How many people\ndid you bring this time? Xiao Xiao\nYao&lt;unk&gt;s expression tightened and he\nquickly said, \"Chief, there were 13\npeople with him.\" Upon hearing this,\neveryone clearly realized something and\nlooked at the group of men in black at\nthe end of the line. Yeanu even began to\ncount them in a low voice. 1 2 3 10 11\n12 There are only 12 people left. A\nshadow. It's a shadow. His expression\nchanged drastically. Damn it. Scatter.\nThe more people gather, the more\nattention the shadow will attract. The\ngroup of people who had been following\nYionu scattered as if by reflex, each\nkeeping a distance of more than 2\nmeters, their expressions filled with\nfear. Unlike their panic, Su Mu and his\ngroup remained motionless, standing\nstill. Only Yong Donging gritted his\nteeth and distanced himself from the\ncrowd. Mr. Su quickly spread out. The\nshadowy figure will be silent for a\nshort time after killing someone. Do not\ngather together during this time as the\nshadowy figure will retreat soon. If you\ngather together, it may reappear. Hold\non to your lanterns and do not leave the\narea illuminated by the candle light,\"\nYionu said anxiously. Because the number\nof lanterns was limited, there weren't\nenough for everyone. Apart from Yion Yu\nand the others who each had one, only\nYong Doning, Ziao Xiao Yao, and Sumu\nhimself each had one. Mr. Yi, does the\nshadowy figure only pull one person at a\ntime? Sumu asked calmly, his brown\ntinted glasses obscuring his eyes and\nmaking it impossible to see his\nexpression. That's right. The shadow\npulls in one person at a time. Mr. Su,\nthe shadow is hiding in the darkness all\naround, spread out quickly. Although\nYion didn't like Sumu, he didn't want\nhim to die at this moment. Sumu laughed.\nIt's all right. I have plenty of people.\nAs he spoke, he instructed the man in\nblack at the very end of the line. Leave\nthe candle light and stand in the\ndarkness. Yes, leader. Without the\nslightest hesitation, the man walked\nstraight out of the candle light and\ninto the unfathomable darkness. He stood\nquietly in the darkness, his figure\nbecoming blurred and indistinct, leaving\nonly a human silhouette. Yeonu and the\nothers watched in horror. None of them\nexpected Su Mu to be so ruthless,\nsending his underlings to their deaths.\nWhat's more, the underlings went without\nhesitation. Wong Lee, who had initially\nplanned to run into Su Mu&lt;unk&gt;s arms\nafter failing to curry favor with\nEphanu, was disheartened by the sight of\nthis scene and abandoned the idea. This\nperson is even more ruthless than\nEifanu. Even though he appears polite\nand gentle, he is extremely cold-blooded\nat heart. Under Sumu's gaze, a shadow\nsuddenly surged behind the underlings\nstanding in the darkness. It was a\nshadow darker than the night itself. It\ntwisted and stretched, gradually\nbulging, and eventually grew into a\nhuman shape. The figure was extremely\nthin, yet very tall, like a giant over 2\nm tall, with only bones remaining, but\nwith long arms that almost reached the\nground. The moment the shadow took\nshape, a pair of scarlet eyes opened at\nthe location of its head, cold and\nindifferent, devoid of any human\nemotion. Yanu and the others all showed\nfear on their faces, subconsciously\nbacking away and holding their breath.\nSumu watched the dark figure with great\ninterest, wanting to see what the other\nparty would do next. Soon, the shadowy\nfigure moved. A black hand slowly\nemerged from the shadow, long and\nwithered, like a deformed branch with\nfive slender fingernails at the tip. The\nterrifying black hand slowly reached\ntowards the underling. For some reason,\nSumu saw a strange elegance in it, like\na gentleman extending his hand to a\nbeautiful lady at a grand party,\ninviting her to dance a waltz. Attack!\nSumu commanded. Without the slightest\nhesitation, the younger brother pulled\nout a pistol from his waist and fired\nwildly at the twisted figure in the\ndarkness. \"Bang, bang, bang!\" Sparks\nflew everywhere. The black shadow that\nwas hit trembled like ripples on water,\nbut quickly returned to calm in the next\nsecond, completely unharmed. Sumu's eyes\nflashed and he took off his brown\nglasses without anyone noticing. His\ndeep eyes emitted a faint light in the\ndarkness and an invisible spiritual\nforce surged out covering the shadowy\nfigure. He decided to try and see if he\ncould hypnotize the shadow, but the\nresult disappointed him. The spiritual\nenergy surged into the shadowy body like\nentering a quagmire without creating the\nslightest ripple. Chapter 31. Nightmare\nmonster. So, it really won't work. Just\nthen, the long, withered black hand\nmoved. It grabbed the henchman's hand\nand pulled him into the darkness. The\nyounger brother struggled violently, but\nall in vain. The surrounding darkness\nengulfed him like a tide, and the\nshadows dragged him along. His steps\nslow but firm as he stepped deeper into\nthe darkness. As the distance increased,\nthe younger brother's figure gradually\nbecame blurred, and his faint struggles\nwere mercilessly swallowed by the\ndarkness. In the end, he and the shadow\ndisappeared together into the boundless,\ndesparing darkness, as if they had never\nexisted, leaving only a deathly silence\nand fear. Such a horrifying scene had a\ngreat impact on everyone's minds. Even\nYean Yu and the others, who had seen the\nshadow before, could not suppress the\nfear in their hearts. To them, the\nshadowy figure was an almost\ninsurmountable force, seemingly immune\nto any attack. It was even more\nterrifying than a humanoid monster with\nimmense strength. At least they could\nfight against a humanoid monster or hide\nin a house. But once caught by the\nshadowy figure, anyone would be dragged\ninto darkness. Its appearance meant\ndeath, and no one could escape it.\n\"Let's go!\" Sumu's calm voice broke the\nfear in the room. As if nothing had\nhappened, he leaned on his snake\npatterned wooden cane and walked\ngracefully into the darkness ahead.\nBehind him, 11 expressionless men in\nblack followed closely. He had a general\nunderstanding of the shadowy figure. And\nnow he was just waiting to meet the\nvillagers of Xiao family village.\nIn the endless darkness, the group moved\nforward with their breath held, their\nheartbeats and heavy breathing weaving\ninto a terrifying symphony. Every step\nwas filled with fear of the unknown. And\nevery breath seemed to be swallowed by\nsilence. Their figures appeared and\ndisappeared in the darkness. The faint\ncandle light illuminating only a small\narea beneath their feet. Each person\nkept a certain distance, not daring to\napproach each other, because they knew\nthat the figures in the darkness were\nwatching them intently. Darkness, like a\nheavy curtain, concealed everything\ncompletely, and the fear of death was\never present. On both sides were houses\nshrouded in darkness. But most of them\nwere singlestory and had been abandoned\nby Yeu. With so many more people,\nsinglestory houses were simply not\nenough to accommodate everyone and could\nnot keep everyone at a distance. It\nwould be best to find houses with two or\nthree stories. The group continued\nforward and before they knew it, the\nsurrounding darkness began to thin and a\nwhite edge of light appeared on the\ndistant horizon. Dawn was approaching.\nYeanu and the others were suddenly\nstartled. Oh no, it's almost dawn. Mr.\nSue, we need to speed things up. Once\nit's completely light, the villagers\nshould be showing up. Sumu frowned\nslightly as he looked at the distant\nhorizon. The timing is wrong. He took\nout a dark gold pocket watch from his\npocket and with a crisp sound the pocket\nwatch was opened showing the time as\n3:00. The dark gold pocket watch gleamed\nin the candle light and Yion Fan Yu and\nthe others subconsciously looked at it\nonly to see a mysterious Uraos engraved\non it. Time and dreams is like that\nunpredictable. Looking at your watch is\nuseless. Let's run. Yanu&lt;unk&gt;s tone\nbecame increasingly anxious. Clearly the\nvillagers had left a deep impression on\nhim. Sumu calmly put away his pocket\nwatch and gave Xiao Xiao Yao a\nmeaningful look. Ziao Xia Yao\nimmediately understood and quickly\nunfassened the backpack behind him,\ntaking out a small and lightweight\nfolding stretcher. After the stretcher\nwas opened, Sumu sat on it under\neveryone's gaze and was lifted up by two\nmen in black. Sorry everyone, I don't\nlike running. Let's go. Yanu and the\nothers watched with wide eyes, wondering\nwho this person was who was putting on\nairs at a time like this. Actually, Sumu\nwasn't putting on airs. He genuinely\ncouldn't run anymore. If he were allowed\nto run, he would have died long before\nthe villagers even chased him. The group\nstarted running while Sumu sat quietly\non the stretcher, enjoying the scenery.\nIt was too dark before to see the\nvillage, but now he could see it more\nclearly. Xiao family village is\ndesolate, like a corner forgotten by\ntime. Many mudbrick houses are crooked\nand look like they might collapse at any\nmoment. The narrow village roads are\ncovered with deep and shallow ruts. more\nlike those of horsedrawn carriages than\ncars. Weeds stubbornly grow out of the\ncracks, and dilapidated fences lean\nprecariously on both sides of the road,\nenclosing small patches of barren\nfarmland. As the sky grew brighter, Sumu\ncould even see the black fog surrounding\nZiao family village. The thick fog\nenveloped the entire village, making it\nlook like a cage. He had heard Yong\nDonging say before that these black\nmists were the boundaries of nightmares.\nXiao family village which was shrouded\nin black mist was a complete nightmare.\nOnce you entered the black mist, you\nwould fall into a dream rift. If you\nwere lucky, you might be able to reach\nthe next nightmare, but if you were\nunlucky, you might be lost in the rift\nforever. It is said that no one has ever\ncome out of the black fog alive. Sumu\nstared at the black mist with great\ninterest, feeling somewhat eager to try\nit out. However, he was not in a hurry.\nTo him, the nightmare world was like a\npeerless beauty. Beneath her gorgeous\nrobes, every inch of her skin was filled\nwith indescribable allure. He wanted to\nexplore it little by little, delve\ndeeper so that he could savor the\ndeliciousness to the fullest extent. As\nfor the possibility of death upon\nentering the black fog, wouldn't that\nmake it even more interesting? Without\nthe pressure of death, how can we\nwitness the sparks of life that ignite\nbetween life and death? How can we\nwitness the brilliance? Roar! A\nnon-human roar interrupted Su Mu's train\nof thought. He turned around and saw a\nfigure that had appeared out of nowhere\nin the corner of the village like a\nghost. The figure was hunched over and\nhis eyes revealed an indescribable\neeriness. Then more and more roars rang\nout from all directions of the village.\nThese roars were filled with endless\npain and anger as if a cursed soul was\nsuffering endless torment. Every\nsyllable was full of resentment which\nwas terrifying. 1 2 3 hundreds. Chapter\n32. Jasmine is dead. I told you. A dense\ncrowd emerged from the shadowy corners\nand stepped into the sunlight. These\npeople included men and women, young and\nold, dressed simply, but each of them\nhad no expression on their face. Yet\ntheir eyes revealed endless malice. They\ngathered in greater and greater numbers\nlike a tightening net surging towards Su\nMu and the others. Heavy footsteps\nechoed through the village like the drum\nbeatats of death, striking the hearts of\neveryone. They've appeared. Run! Yionu\nshouted anxiously, rushing out like a\ncheetah. His target was a three-story\nhouse in the northwest corner of the\nvillage, which was basically the tallest\nbuilding in Xiao Family Village.\nPreviously shrouded in darkness, the\nthree-story house now came into view\nthanks to the increasingly bright\nsunlight. While everyone was running for\ntheir lives, Sumu leisurely watched,\neven taking the time to observe the\nappearance of the villagers. He was not\nflustered at all because there was no\nuse in being flustered. He couldn't run\nfast enough and he couldn't fight back.\nHe might as well sit on the stretcher\nand enjoy the scenery. He finally\nunderstood why Eonu suspected that they\nwere nightmare monsters. To be honest,\nthe expressions of the Viper gang\nunderlings were not much different from\nthose of the villagers. They all looked\nlike they had been hypnotized and\nbrainwashed with expressionless faces.\nWait, what? Hypnosis? Sumu pondered.\nCould it be that these villagers also\nhave a leader who is controlling them?\nHe looked around but couldn't see anyone\nwho looked like the leader. Indeed, not\nall leaders are as classy as I am. My\noutstanding charisma standing out from\nthe crowd is impossible to conceal. Get\nout of the way. Yeu at the front of the\ngroup, roared, his right hand forming a\ngun shape as he fired a shot at a\nvillager blocking his path. Boom! Highly\ncompressed flame bullets whistled from\nfingertips, striking the villagers\ndirectly and exploding in a burst of\nintense flames. However, although the\nvillager fell into the flames, he\nquickly got up. Even though most of his\nbody was charred, he was not affected at\nall and still rushed towards Ephonu.\nBang bang. Two more five fingers flame\nbullets were fired and the villager was\ncompletely reduced to a mangled charred\ncorpse before falling silent. Sumu\nobserved silently. Could it really take\nthree fireballs to take down a villager?\nNo wonder Yion hadn't dared to go out\nfor the past 3 days. There were hundreds\nof villagers, but he was the only\nsuperhuman unless he was a five-finger\ngatling gun. He simply couldn't fight\nhim. At this moment, more and more\nvillagers appeared in front of them,\nblocking their way, and Yong Dongqing\nwas forced to join the battle. Compared\nto Yion's dazzling fire attacks, Yong\nDonging appeared much more down to\nearth. Relying on his iron will, he\ncharged towards the villagers like a\nheavily armored tank. With a single\npunch, a villager was sent flying\nseveral meters away, his chest dented.\nHowever, his attack was clearly less\nlethal than Yion, and the villager\nquickly stood up as if nothing had\nhappened. Fortunately, the villagers had\ndifficulty breaking through Yong\nDong&lt;unk&gt;s defenses. But once Yong\nDoning was surrounded, he certainly\nwouldn't live long as his physical\nstrength was limited. With two\nextraordinary individuals leading the\nway, the group couldn't move quickly,\nbut they weren't completely surrounded\neither. Xiao X Chow Yao and the others\nwere not idle either. Under the hypnotic\ncontrol, this group of elites from the\nViper gang were completely cold-blooded\nfighting machines. Facing the inhuman\nmonsters, they showed no fear at all,\nbut instead became even more fanatical,\nas if protecting their leader was an\nextremely honorable thing. Bang, bang,\nbang. The dense barrage of bullets kept\nrepelling the villagers chasing from\nbehind. But unfortunately, its lethality\nwas very limited. Unless you focused\nfire on one villager and riddled him\nwith bullets, it was difficult to kill\nhim. After a brief exchange of fire,\nYeanu, who had cleared a path with his\nfireballs, was the first to rush into\nthe courtyard of the three-story house.\nHe didn't stop and ran straight to the\ngate. It was a heavy solid wood door\nwith a pair of bronze door knockers and\nlaid on it, showing semnity and\nantiquity. He pushed open the door and\nshouted to the crowd behind him, \"Quick,\ncome inside.\" Li Chong and the others\nall showed joy on their faces. After 3\ndays of hunger, a sliver of strength\nsurged through their bodies again, and\nthey ran desperately toward the gate.\nHowever, no matter how fast they ran,\nthey couldn't outrun the Viper Gang.\nAfter all, these dozen or so members of\nthe Viper Gang were all elites, and even\ncarrying a stretcher, their speed was\nstill astonishing. Of course, no matter\nhow fast the Viper gang was, they\ncouldn't outrun Yong Donging, this\nextraordinary individual. He took the\nlead and came in second place. Just as\nthe members of the Viper gang were about\nto enter the gate with Sumu in their\narms, a sudden and unexpected event\noccurred. No one noticed that two\nvillagers suddenly rushed out from\nbehind a large locust tree in the\ncourtyard of this three-story house.\nThey suddenly pounced on the crowd and\neven the elite Viper gang members were\nknocked to the ground before they could\nreact. Ah. Wong Lei screamed in fright\nand Li Chong and the others also\npanicked and ran away in a panic and the\nscene instantly turned into chaos.\nProtect the leader, Ziao Xiao shouted,\ndrawing his machete and slashing at the\ntwo villagers. However, villagers who\nare difficult to kill even by\nsuperhumans are not something ordinary\npeople can handle. In close combat, the\nViper gang underlings are no match for\nthem. Most importantly, the villagers\nbehind them also caught up. Uh, don't\neat me. The man named Wong Tao was the\nfirst to suffer. He was tackled to the\nground by a villager and then several\nvillagers rushed up and surrounded him,\ntearing at him frantically. Only one arm\nstruggled through the gaps in the crowd,\nweakly reaching for the sky before\nfinally falling heavily to the ground\nand remaining silent. In such a chaotic\nscene, Sumu, sitting on the stretcher,\nwas a little unsteady. The stretcher\nkept swaying and his underlings formed a\nhuman wall to protect him. He could even\nsee up close a ferocious face tearing\nviciously at the neck of one of his\nunderlings. Despite being fatally\nwounded, the underling refused to back\ndown, instead clinging tightly to the\nattacking villager, and with the help of\nothers, blocking the villagers advance.\nThe stretcher swayed more and more, and\nthe violent jolting made Sumu&lt;unk&gt;s head\nstart to ache again. Sumu frowned and\nlooked at Yong Donging standing at the\ngate. Yanu did not make a move at this\nmoment because his five fingers flame\nbullet was very powerful. Everyone was\nin chaos right now and if he used it in\nthe courtyard, he would probably kill\nhis teammates instead of the villagers.\nYong Dong&lt;unk&gt;s expression was\nuncertain, as if he was hesitating. He\nlooked at Sumu and their eyes met\nthrough the chaotic crowd. Sumu\nunderstood Yong Dongqing&lt;unk&gt;s inner\nstruggle. Yong Donging wondered if Sumu\nwould die like this. Wouldn't he and\nJasmine be able to escape the clutches\nof evil? But he was also afraid. Afraid\nthat Sumu might have other tricks up his\nsleeve. As the two interacted, his fear\nof Sumu grew stronger. This man was\nsimply a demon in human skin, able to\nsmile as he watched his subordinates die\nand finding the terrifying nightmare\nmonsters amusing. Moreover, the other\nparty actually has the means to drag so\nmany people into the same nightmare.\nSuddenly, Sumu smiled silently.\nSuperhumans are indeed difficult to\ncontrol. They will break free from\nhypnosis at the slightest opportunity.\nBut that's more interesting, isn't it?\nHis smile was so glaringly obvious among\nthe terrified faces that Yong Donging\nalmost dared not look at him. Then he\nstretched out his fair and slender hand\nand gently traced a line across his\nneck. A cold, emotionless smile curled\nup, revealing gleaming white teeth and\nthin yet sensual lips opened and closed\nsilently. Jasmine is dead. I told you.\nChapter 33. I like the scent of jasmine.\nBoom. Yang Doning charged into the crowd\nlike a tiger descending a mountain. His\nexpression furious and ferocious. His\nfists brimming with rage swung fiercely\nat the villagers. Iron Hart unleashes\nterrifying power at this moment. This is\nhis extraordinary power. His steel body\nis strengthened by inner driving forces\nsuch as emotions, will, and beliefs. In\nhis outburst, two villagers inside the\ncourtyard were quickly knocked down. But\nhe did not stop. Instead, he blocked the\ncourtyard gate alone, facing the attack\nof several villagers. At this moment,\nSumu, escorted by his underlings,\nentered through the gate. Watching Yong\nDong&lt;unk&gt;s angry back, Sumu&lt;unk&gt;s smile\ndeepened. Is this still not enough to\nsubdue you? Actually, he was just trying\nto scare Yong Doning. Hypnosis isn't\nthat magical. Even if someone is in a\nnightmare world and can control Nimmo\nand deal with the scum of the poisonous\nsnake gang, he has to use his mental\npower to brainwash her everyday for\nseveral months to achieve her deeprooted\nloyalty. How much more so for Nanimo,\nwhom he has only met a few times. In\nother words, if he really died, Nano,\nwho hadn't been hypnotized for a long\ntime, would be out of control and\nwouldn't be in any danger. But Young\nDonging dared not gamble. Sumugan, if\nyou lose the bet, it only proves that\nthere are countless heroes in this\nworld. After all the survivors had\nentered the gate, Ephanu suddenly\nstretched out his right hand. His five\nfingers spread wide while his left hand\ngripped his right wrist tightly. Get out\nof the way. As soon as he finished\nspeaking, flames lit up one by one at\nthe tips of the five fingers of his\nright hand. Swish, swish, swish. As five\nflames burned at his fingertips, Yong\nDoning felt the air behind him suddenly\nbecome incredibly hot. He abruptly broke\nfree from the villagers in front of him\nand lunged towards the mud on the side.\nFive-finger flame bullet. Five highly\ncompressed fire bullets shot out,\ntrailing long fiery tails as they spun\nand intertwined in midair, eventually\nmerging into a fist-sized fire\nprojectile. Like a dazzling meteor, it\nstreaked across the sky, scorching and\ndistorting the air in the entire\ncourtyard, illuminating the horrified\nfaces of everyone in a long trail of\nflames. Boom! A deafening roar, like the\nexplosion of a small cannonball, rang\nout, and intense flames shot into the\nsky, illuminating everything around\nthem. The shock waves generated by the\nexplosion and flames swept the villagers\naway like an invisible giant hand, and\ncountless sparks flew, turning into a\nmagnificent and surging small sea of\nfire. A look of shock flashed in Yong\nDonging&lt;unk&gt;s eyes as he got up. That\nattack was so powerful. used this attack\nagainst him before. Even someone with a\nbody of steel would have been injured.\nAs expected of a superhuman who has\nexperienced three nightmare worlds, if\nit really came down to a fight, I, a\nnewly promoted superhuman, would still\nbe a notch below unless I could get\nclose. The thought flashed through his\nmind, and he rushed into the house.\nBang! The heavy wooden door was tightly\nclosed. Only then did everyone breathe a\nsigh of relief, as if they had escaped a\ndisaster. Yeu panting heavily said, \"As\nlong as we stay indoors during the day,\nwe&lt;unk&gt;ll be fine.\" The shadowy figure\ndidn't appear during the day, and\nthere's basically no danger in the\nhouses. He took a long time to catch his\nbreath. Clearly, the attack had taken a\nheavy toll on him. Inside the room, Yong\nDonging stared intently at Sumu, his\nanger still burning. Sumu got up from\nthe stretcher, leaned on his cane, and\ncame to Yong Dong&lt;unk&gt;s side. He smiled\nand patted the others shoulder, then\nwhispered in his ear, \"Congratulations,\nyou've saved Miss Jasmine again.\" Yang\nDoning clenched his fists, veins bulging\non his face, and silently found a corner\nto stay in. Yionu noticed this unusual\nscene. His eyes narrowed slightly, and\nhe seemed to be thinking about\nsomething. The room fell silent again.\nHaving just experienced such a dangerous\nscene, no one was in the mood for\nconversation. Everyone was trying to\ncalm themselves down, especially after\nwitnessing so many people die before\ntheir eyes. The slightly more vulnerable\nWong Lee curled up in the corner,\nburying her head between her legs and\nsobbing silently. After this battle, Eon\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s team lost two members, Wong Tao\nand Xiao Gang. While Sumu's side also\nlost three members. However, Sumu was\nnot saddened. Instead, he was observing\nthe villagers outside the window with\ngreat interest. Yionifonu seemed unable\nto last long. Or perhaps they were\nneutralized by the mysterious power in\nthe nightmare. Instead of causing a\nlarge fire in the village, they quickly\ndissipated. The villagers who tried to\nrush and were probably driven back by\nthe flames. Under Sumu's watchful gaze,\na few seconds later, the villagers\noutside gathered again and began to pour\ninto the courtyard. More and more of\nthem gathered, each with a blank\nexpression like zombies, until they\nfinally filled the entire courtyard.\nSurprisingly, after the villagers\nentered the courtyard, they just stared\nintently at the gate, but not a single\none rushed up to break down the\nseemingly sturdy wooden door, as if some\nmagical force instilled fear in them.\nThey stood stiffly, silent, and still.\nThe courtyard was deafly still, except\nfor a dark mass of figures. Sumu met the\ngazes of these people through the\nwindow. He lowered his head slightly,\nhis glasses slipping down to reveal a\npair of eyes that gleamed with an eerie\nlight. An invisible surge of spiritual\npower erupted from his eyes, locking\nonto a male villager who looked to be 17\nor 18 years old. He tried to hypnotize\nthe villagers. But no matter how much\nmental energy he poured into them, it\nwas to no avail, as if he were pouring\nin a corpse instead of a living person.\nThe villagers stood in the courtyard for\nabout 5 minutes before they began to\nleave, turning away slowly and heavily,\ndisappearing from Sumu's sight. That's\nhow these villagers are. Once they're\ninside the house, they won't attack\nanymore. You find you had somehow gotten\nclose to the window, but you must not\nopen the door at this time. They may\nseem to have left, but they are actually\nhiding around the house. As soon as you\nopen the door, they will swarm in. Also,\ndraw the curtains. Do not look at any\nnoise outside. Some people in the group\nwere fooled before. They said they saw\ntheir relatives and insisted on opening\nthe window to let their relatives in.\nBecause of that incident, many of us\ndied. Sumu turned around, pushed up his\nbrown glasses to cover his eyes again,\nreached into his pocket, and under\nYion's surprised gaze, pulled out a pack\nof cigarettes with jasmine flowers\nprinted on them, then skillfully took\none out and put it in his mouth. Want\none? Eion was taken aback. looking at\nthe cigarette in the other person's\nmouth. He felt a sudden urge to smoke.\nHe was also a smoker, but he had long\nsince run out of cigarettes after\narriving in the nightmare world. Okay.\nSo, Sumu took out another one and handed\nit to Eionu. Ephanu took the cigarette,\nbut didn't put it in his mouth. Instead,\nhe examined it carefully and asked,\n\"What brand of cigarettes is this? This\nis the first time I've seen one like\nthis.\" Sumu smiled and said, \"I like the\nscent of jasmine, so I specially\ncommissioned a jasmine- flavored\ncigarette.\" In the corner, Yong\nDong&lt;unk&gt;s body trembled slightly, his\nfists clenched tightly. Chapter 34. The\nseller. As Sumu spoke, he took out a\nlighter to light Yion's cigarette, but\nYionu immediately looked flustered and\nsaid, \"Mr. Su, you're too kind. Let me\ndo it.\" Without saying a word, he took\nthe lighter and handed it to Sumu. Snap!\nA faint flame burned between the two.\nAfter you, Sumu smiled. He naturally\nknew what Eionu meant. Yionu was afraid\nthat there was something wrong with the\ncigarettes, so he didn't dare to smoke\nfirst. He didn't expose him and let Eonu\nlight the cigarette. After Sumu took a\ndeep breath, Eionu lit his own cigarette\nand pretended to exhale smoke, but if\nyou looked closely, you would find that\nhe didn't actually inhale. \"Can I have\none, too?\" Li Chong asked with a hint of\nlonging in his voice, which trembled\nslightly, as if he were somewhat afraid\nof the two men. Of course, Sumu smiled,\nhis smile more polite and gentle than\narrogant towards ordinary people. He\nhanded Li Chong a cigarette, and for a\nmoment, the air was filled with the\nscent of jasmine. Li Chong took a deep\ndrag, but the more he inhaled, the more\nsomething felt wrong because he couldn't\ntaste any smoke at all. Instead, his\nmouth was filled with the fragrance of\njasmine. However, he didn't dare to say\nmuch, only thinking that important\npeople might like to smoke this kind of\ncigarette. Enveloped in the fragrance of\njasmine, everyone's emotions\ninexplicably eased a little, and Wong\nLee, who had been crying silently, had\nfallen asleep at some point. Mr. Su, I\nsuggest you take a rest as well. Eion\nsaid, smoking a cigarette. Because we\ncan't leave the house during the day, we\ncan only go out at night to find food\nand candles. So, we've basically been\nworking day and night for the past few\ndays, sleeping during the day and moving\naround at night. No rush. I just\narrived, so I'll take a stroll around.\nMaybe I can find some clues about the\nnightmares.\" Sumu smiled and declined,\nhis gaze shifting slightly to the hall.\nThe spacious living room is furnished\nwith simple and practical wooden\nfurniture. There is a pair of blue and\nwhite porcelain vases on the counter.\nThe floor is covered with smooth\npatterned tiles. In the corner of the\nnorth side of the hall, there is a\nwooden staircase leading directly to the\nsecond floor. Although the decoration\nhere is also relatively simple, it is\nobviously a grade higher than the\nprevious houses. Moreover, it seems to\nbe the only three-story building in the\nentire village. Logically speaking, the\nowner of this house is most likely the\nvillage chief of Xiao family village.\nYongu&lt;unk&gt;s eyes brightened slightly.\nThe village chief's house might have\nfood. To be honest, we haven't eaten for\n3 days. We searched several houses under\nthe cover of darkness, but we didn't\nfind anything to eat. This place is\nrelatively wealthy, so maybe there's\nsomething to eat here. Let's go shopping\ntogether then. Good. Sumu took a step\nforward, but stopped after only two\nsteps and said to Yong Donging in the\ncorner, \"You come, too.\" Yong Donging\nsilently got up and followed Sumu\nwithout saying a word. The three of them\nquickly tooured the three-story house,\nbut found nothing. It was just an\nordinary house. If there was anything\nstrange about it, it was that it was old\nand dilapidated, like a village from the\nlast century with no trace of modernity.\nSai still no food. Eion's face was very\nugly. Although he was a superhuman, he\nstill needed to eat. It was very\nuncomfortable to go 3 days without food.\nHe could only pin his hopes on Sumu. Mr.\nSu, do you have any food with you? Sumu\nshook his head. I'm sorry, I don't have\nany either. Yanu&lt;unk&gt;s expression\ndarkened and he forced a smile. Looks\nlike we'll have to wait until tonight.\nPerhaps not. Sumu suddenly smiled\nmysteriously. He bent down slightly and\ntouched the hard patterned tile with his\nhand. When he stood up, his pale\nfingertips were covered with dust. He\nrubbed the dust off his fingers, his\ngaze fixed on a corner of the hall. At\nthis moment, Ziao Xiao quickly took out\na white handkerchief from his pocket and\nrespectfully and carefully wiped Su\nMu&lt;unk&gt;s fingertips clean. Yianu&lt;unk&gt;s\nlips twitched slightly at the site, and\nhe tentatively asked, \"Is Mr. Mr. Sue,\nan aristocrat. Oh, how do you know? I\njust think that Mr. Sue's behavior and\ndemeanor are really like those of an\naristocrat. Sumu simply smiled politely\nand did not answer. Living in the lower\ncity, he had never seen nobles before\nand found it hard to imagine that there\nwere people in the world like him. Is\nthis what nobles are? Seeing that Sumu\ndid not answer, Yionu immediately\nchanged the subject. By the way, Mr.\nSue, what did you mean when you said\nthat perhaps it's not necessary? Have\nyou already discovered something? He\nremained very polite. In the nightmare\nworld, when there was no conflict of\ninterest, it would be foolish to make\nenemies with other superhumans,\nespecially since Sumu, a superhuman, was\nclearly not someone to be trifled with.\nSumu nodded, lightly raised his\nsnakeskin cane, and pointed to the\nground at the staircase leading to the\nsecond floor. There's very little dust\nthere. Ephanu looked in the direction of\nthe cane, and his expression immediately\nlit up with joy. The village may have a\nhabit of building cellers to store food.\nThat might be a seller. He quickly went\nover and the slanted shadow of the\nstairs blocked the tiles below. He\nreached out and touched them. And sure\nenough, there was only a thin layer of\ndust, much less than in other places. At\nthis moment, he had his back to Sumu,\nand no one noticed the somnity and\napprehension that appeared on his face.\nWhat keen observation skills? How many\nsecrets is Sumu hiding given his ability\nto control so many people and possess\nsuch sharp observation skills? He had\njust gone upstairs with Sumu, but he\nhadn't noticed anything wrong with the\ntiles in the shadows at the bottom of\nthe stairs. Or rather, it wasn't\nsomething that could be seen with the\nnaked eye. Who can see the dust on the\ntiles covered in shadow? This person\nmust possess some kind of investigative\ntechnique. Eion's guess was correct.\nSumu did not see with his eyes, but with\nhis mental power. His extraordinary\nmental power not only gave him the\nability to hypnotize, but also came with\npowerful perception. Knock-knock. Yionu\ntapped the tile with his knuckles,\nproducing a clear, hollow sound. He\nturned around, his face beaming with\njoy. It's hollow. He ran his hand along\nthe seams of the tile, then found a\nprotrusion. With a forceful push, the\ntile opened, revealing a cellar large\nenough for one person to enter. Mr. Su,\nthere really is a seller. Yionu walked\nover with delight, but did not go down\nimmediately. He was not stupid, although\nhe knew there was no danger inside the\nhouse, who could guarantee that there\nwould be no danger in the cellar. Who\nwould be so kind as to build a cellar in\ntheir home and hide it so secretly?\nChapter 35. Tinting. Sumu did not expose\nhis ulterior motives. In the perilous\nnightmare world, Yionu still had value\nto him. Hey, you send someone down to\ncheck. Yes, leader. Xiao Xiao\nimmediately assigned a person from the\nteam. That person naturally without fear\nlit a lantern and went down into the\ncellar. The crowd watched from above as\nthe faint candle light gradually\npenetrated deeper into the darkness only\nto be swallowed up bit by bit. A moment\nlater, the henchman's voice came from\nbelow. Boss, there's no danger inside.\nSumu remained expressionless and did not\ngo down. Instead, he instructed, \"Come\nup first.\" \"Yes, chief.\" Afterwards, the\nhenchmen climbed up unharmed. After a\ncareful inspection, Sumu was finally\ncertain that the cellar was safe. Ephanu\nhad previously mentioned that villagers\ncould change their appearance and\nimitate those close to them. If a\nvillager in the cellar killed a member\nof the poisonous snake gang and then\ntransformed into his appearance, going\ndown there rashly would definitely be\ndangerous. What's down there? Reporting\nto the chief, it's very dark down there.\nThere are some dried blood stains on the\nwalls as well as instruments of torture.\nHowever, those instruments are rather\nunusual. Mostly whips, chili oil, ropes,\ncrosslocks, and so on. Yionu smiled\nsarcastically. Looks like this village\nchief is playing some tricks. Sumu\nfrowned slightly. Go down and take a\nlook. Yong Doning, lead the way. As the\nhuman shield, Yong Doning naturally had\nto be at the forefront. Yong Doning, who\nremained silent, took the lead and went\ninto the cellar, followed closely by\nYiong Yu and then Su Mu. Soon, everyone\nwent into the cellar, leaving only a few\nhenchmen to guard the outside. The\ncellar was about 50 square m in size and\npitch black. Only the lantern in my hand\ncould barely illuminate the way forward.\nIt was filled with the smell of decay.\nI'll do it. Yea was probably really\nstarving and couldn't wait any longer.\nHe stretched out a finger and swished. A\nblazing flame appeared at his\nfingertips, its light several times\nbrighter than a candle, instantly\nilluminating the entire cellar. At this\nmoment, everyone could finally see the\nentire cellar. The surrounding walls\nwere made of cement with many modeled\nblood stains on them. Over time, the\nblood stains had been imprinted on the\nwalls, giving them a dark color. In the\ncenter of the cellar sat a huge\ncross-shaped lock with blood stains\nstill visible on the handcuffs and\nshackles, suggesting that someone had\nbeen strapped to it in a spread eagle\nposition. Next to the cross lock was a\nwooden table with whips, short sticks,\ncandles, and some women's clothing on\nit. Seeing this, it wasn't hard for\nanyone to imagine what the cellar was\nused for. Damn it, Yionu cursed under\nhis breath. Why not use a proper seller\nto store food instead of this stuff? He\nstepped forward and picked up the unused\nred candles on the table. Fortunately,\nthere are still three candles left, so\nthey can still be used to some extent.\nMr. Su, there are many of you, so I'll\nkeep one candle and you can share the\nrest. Yanu was met with complete\nsilence. He tilted his head slightly,\nlooked at Su Mu and the others, and\nasked in confusion, \"Sue?\" He had barely\nuttered a word when he realized\nsomething was wrong because Sumu and the\nothers were all staring intently at the\ncrosslock behind him. His scalp tingled\ninstantly, and almost without thinking,\nhe retreated rapidly, moving away from\nthe crosslock. As he retreated, he\nturned his head and glanced at it out of\nthe corner of his eye, and his pupils\nsuddenly contracted. A woman had\nappeared on the previously empty\ncrosslock. The woman was thin and\ndisheveled, wearing a blue and white\nfloral dress, and was tied to a cross\nlock in a starfish shape. Her disheveled\nhair obscured her face, and her floral\ndress was stained with blood and filth.\nEveryone looked at the woman as if\nfacing a formidable enemy. Yeon, who was\nstartled, was filled with shock and\nanger, and he immediately activated the\nflamethrower he was using for\nillumination. It left a long trail of\nflame in the air and hurdled towards the\nwoman. However, the fire bullet passed\nstraight through the woman's body as if\nit were passing through air and finally\nhit the corner of the cellar, exploding\ninto a bright spark. The blow shook the\nentire cellar, and a lot of dust fell\nfrom the roof. With lightning speed,\nZiao Xiao ripped off his suit jacket and\nflung it out like an umbrella, shielding\nSu Mu&lt;unk&gt;s head with it. \"This is a\nsilhouette of time,\" Yionu said in\nsurprise and doubt. \"What is a time\nsilhouette?\" Yong Donaing asked,\nprompted by Su Mu&lt;unk&gt;s gaze. Eionu took\na deep breath. I heard it from someone\nelse. The so-called time silhouette is\nlike cutting out fragments or scenes of\ntime like paper cutting. To put it\nsimply, it's like watching a movie and\nthe director is time. Everything that\nhappens is recorded by time and then it\nis revealed due to some mysterious\nforce. The nightmare world is very\nspecial. Time is distorted here. So,\ntime silhouettes are very likely to\noccur. It must be that when I picked up\nthe candle, I triggered some kind of\nevent that caused the time silhouette.\nRest assured, the time silhouette only\ndisplays sound and images and poses no\ndanger whatsoever. Is time so boring?\nWhy record everything? Yang Doning\nfrowned as he looked at the woman in the\npicture. He was disgusted by this kind\nof thing. Yonu shook his head. Not\neverything is recorded. Only people or\nevents with special significance or the\nmain characters in the scene who are in\na certain extreme emotion and resonate\nwith time will be recorded. In this\nnightmare, a timeline was triggered and\nperhaps the woman in the image is the\nsource of the dream. In other words,\nthis is her nightmare. Her nightmare.\nYong Dong&lt;unk&gt;s gaze fell on the woman's\nfloral dress. Her clothes are very\nretro, not like those of a modern\nperson, but more like those of someone\nfrom decades ago. Could this be a\nnightmare from decades ago? It should\nbe. The nightmare world is made up of\nendless nightmares. Modern people have\nnightmares and ancient people had\nnightmares, too. So, it's not impossible\nto encounter ancient scenes in the\nnightmare world. Sometimes the boundary\nbetween dreams and reality is blurred.\nEven time itself is in chaos. As\neveryone was talking, another person\nsuddenly appeared in the time\nsilhouette. It was a young man with dark\nskin and an honest face. He appeared in\nthe picture carrying a plate of steaming\ndumplings. A thoughtful look appeared in\nSumu's eyes. There was this man among\nthe previous villagers. Everyone looked\nover quickly and indeed felt that the\nface looked somewhat familiar. Ting ting\ntinking. I've come to see you. The man\nwalked quickly to the woman and said\nhappily, \"Ting ting. Look, I brought you\nyour favorite dumplings.\" At this\nmoment, the woman on the cross lock\nseemed to be awakened and struggled to\nraise her head, and everyone finally saw\nher face clearly. Chapter 36. The crimes\nof the cellar. It was a dirty little\nface, except for the area under her\neyes, which was relatively clean,\nrevealing a patch of white skin,\nobviously from tears. Although it was a\nbit dirty, you could still vaguely tell\nthat the woman had a pretty face. She\nwouldn't be called a beauty of\nunparalleled grace, but she did have a\ndelicate and charming look. The most\nstriking feature was his eyes, clear as\na spring, but now they were filled with\nfear and dread. The woman's eyes lit up\nwhen she saw the steaming dumplings in\nfront of her. Ting Ting, did my dad\nabuse you again? The man looked at\nTing&lt;unk&gt;s haggarded appearance. A flash\nof anger in his eyes. Don't worry, I\nwill definitely get you out of here.\nHere, have some dumplings first. You\nmust hold on. The man carefully picked\nup a dumpling with his hand, blew on it,\nand then held it to Tinking&lt;unk&gt;s mouth.\nTining opened her mouth with difficulty\nand chewed it in small bites. \"Is it\ngood? I made it myself.\" The man's eyes\ngleamed with anticipation, his voice\ntinged with eagerness and longing, like\na child waiting for candy, hoping to\nhear a positive answer. \"It's\ndelicious,\" Tinking said weakly, a smile\nappearing on her dirty face. The smile\nwas very pure, without any impurities or\npretense, and her clear eyes curved into\ncrescent shapes. Upon receiving an\naffirmative answer, the man trembled\nwith excitement. That's wonderful. I\nknew you'd like it. Tinking. After all,\nthese are dog meat dumplings I made\nmyself. Dog meat? Tinting trembled\nslightly. The man became increasingly\nexcited. Yes, it's that big yellow dog\nyou raised since it was a puppy. Don't\nlet its age fool you. It still has some\nstrength. When I tried to kill it with a\nknife, it almost bit me. Upon hearing\nthis, Sumu and the others witnessed what\nit meant for smiles to freeze. That once\ninnocent and pure smile gradually\nhardened and solidified until it\nshattered. Her clear, bright eyes seemed\nto be covered with a layer of gray. A\nlayer of gray that could not be washed\naway no matter how many tears she shed.\nEat up, Tinting. Don't you love\ndumplings the most? The man rudely fed\nTinting Dumplings. You [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] eat it.\nHis expression grew increasingly\nexcited, even bordering on ferocious.\nHar, what an idiot. You actually believe\nthat? Ever since you were imprisoned,\nthat old dog has been guarding your\ndilapitated hut. Neither eating nor\ndrinking. It's long dead. Where am I\nsupposed to find dog meat? At most, I\ncan get you a couple of dog bones.\nClick, click. That was the sound of Yong\nDonging&lt;unk&gt;s fists rubbing together\nwith too much force, somewhat like two\npieces of metal rubbing together. His\nface was extremely gloomy, and his eyes\nwere like volcanoes about to erupt with\nextreme anger brewing. that beast. He\nalmost ground his teeth to powder. If\nthe scene before him hadn't been fake,\nhe would have already charged forward.\nHowever, what happened next was even\nmore heinous. After feeding the man the\ndumplings, he began to assault him with\nexcitement. The seller was filled with\nthe man's maniacal laughter and the\nwoman screams. \"How is it, Tinking? Has\nmy father been here?\" \"Ting, do you know\nwhat I like most about you? It's your\nchubby, fleshy body, huh? Bastard.\" Yong\nDonging was furious and rushed forward,\nthrowing a furious punch at the man. But\nthe punch only hit the air. It's&lt;unk&gt; no\nuse. These are things that have happened\nbefore, and you can't stop them now,\nYion said. Yang Doning&lt;unk&gt;s chest\nheaved violently, his eyes wide with\nfury. He turned his head away, unable to\nbear to look any longer. Soon, the man\nleft, leaving behind only the dying\ntinting and the deathly darkness of the\ncellar. She stared blankly at the\ntrampled dumplings on the ground as if\nshe had run out of tears. The scene\nseemed frozen in time without any\nmovement. However, everyone knew that\nthe scene was not still. Tinting in the\nscene was constantly suffering from\nextreme despair and grief. Suddenly, the\nperceptive Sumu noticed the change in\nthe scene and pointed to the shadow in\nthe corner. A dark shadow has appeared.\nEveryone was instantly shocked and\ninstinctively scattered, but they soon\nrealized that the so-called dark figure\nwas not in reality, but in the picture.\nIn the corner of the cellar where Ting\nwas, a shadow was silently surging,\ntwisting and stretching, gradually\nrising and growing into a human shape.\nIt looked exactly like the shadowy\nfigure Su Mu and the others had seen\nbefore. It was extremely thin, as if it\nwere just bones, and its arms were so\nlong that they almost reached the\nground. The dark figure moved swiftly\ntowards Ting. Tinking stared blankly at\nthe figure, her despair not replaced by\nfear. Under Ting&lt;unk&gt;s gaze, the dark\nfigure gracefully extended its arm, a\nslender arm made of shadow, as if\nextending some kind of invitation. Are\nyou the nightmare grandma talked about?\nTinting asked weakly. The shadowy figure\ndidn't answer. Instead, it stretched its\narm forward and stopped beside\nTinking&lt;unk&gt;s hand. Without hesitation,\nTing firmly grasped the hand of the dark\nfigure with her small handcuffed hand.\nThe scene abruptly ended there. Everyone\nremained silent. Ting&lt;unk&gt;s experience\nleft them feeling somewhat depressed.\nSumu pondered, \"If this place is\nTing&lt;unk&gt;s nightmare, then what about\nthe shadowy figure? Logically, it should\nbe a monster from a nightmare. But\njudging from the timeline, the shadowy\nfigure has also appeared in the reality\nwhere Ting is.\" Yionu suddenly said,\n\"Perhaps the shadowy figure is a monster\nfrom another nightmare that invaded\nreality, found Tinking, and some kind of\nreaction occurred between them, leading\nto the current nightmare. Or perhaps\nthis isn't Tinking's nightmare at all,\nand the shadowy figure is the source of\nthe nightmare. Whichever possibility it\nmay be, the shadow is crucial. Perhaps\nthe key to breaking the nightmare lies\nin the shadow.\" After a brief\ndiscussion, no one could reach a\nconclusion, and they eventually returned\nto the ground. Mr. Sue, I'm going to my\nroom on the second floor to rest for a\nwhile. I couldn't find any food this\ntime, so I need to conserve my energy by\nsleeping. I'll have to trouble you to\ntake care of me during the day,\" Eanu\nsaid wearily. Sumu nodded, letting the\nother person go to rest. They hadn't\neaten or rested properly for 3 days.\nEven an iron man couldn't withstand\nthat. He made some simple arrangements\nand told Xiao Xiao Yao and the others to\ngo and rest. Then he took Yong Donging\nto a room on the third floor. Yong\nDoning was his personal bodyguard, so he\nwould never do something as foolish as\nsleeping in his room and then arranging\nfor Yong Doning to go to the next room.\nIn the room on the third floor, Yong\nDoning&lt;unk&gt;s face was gloomy, as if he\nwas still immersed in Tinking suffering.\nHe was indeed an extraordinary person,\nbut he was also a young man, a\npassionate young man whose values simply\ncould not accept such a tragic thing.\nSumu lay on the bed, calmly staring at\nthe ceiling. He was thinking about the\nrelationship between Ting and the\nshadowy figure. As he was thinking, he\nsuddenly felt a burning sensation in his\nnose. He reached out and touched it. It\nwas a bright red blood stain. Chapter\n37. Pick it up. Pick up the clothes.\nHuh? He chuckled softly, took out a\nhandkerchief, and wiped away the blood\nstains. We're closer to death now. He\nhad arrived in the nightmare world, but\nas young Doning had said, he had not\nsince the bronze law and become a\ntranscendent being. It seemed that he\nreally didn't have any talent. He closed\nhis eyes and tried to use his senses to\nfind the omnipresent bronze law, but to\nno avail. Knock-knock. The sound of\nKnuckles tapping on glass rang out. Sumu\nopened his eyes and Yong Donging also\nstood up instantly looking at the only\nwindow in the room with a solemn\nexpression. The window was blocked by\ncurtains and the knocking sound was\ncoming from outside. Looks like we have\na guest coming. Sumu became interested.\nHe slowly got up, walked to the window,\nand used his cane to part the curtains.\nA woman came into view. A woman whomsu\nMu and Yong Doning were both very\nfamiliar with. \"Jasmine, Jasmine,\" Yong\nDoning exclaimed in surprise. \"How could\nyou?\" He stopped abruptly halfway\nthrough his sentence, remembering Li\nChong and Yiu s description of the\nvillagers. \"These villagers would\ntransform into the appearance of\ndoor.\" \"Damn it!\" Yong Doning clenched\nhis fists, his anger surging. He was\nalready in a bad mood after coming out\nof the cellar. And now that he saw the\nnightmare monster had turned into\nJasmine, he was even more furious.\nOutside the window, Jasmine's little\nface was filled with fear and anxiety.\nShe kept banging on the window, calling\nout, \"Young Doning! Yong Doning! I'm so\nscared. Where am I? Shut up, you\nmonster!\" Yong Doning roared. Jasmine's\npretty face turned pale, her face full\nof heartbreak. What are you talking\nabout, Yong Donging? I'm not a monster.\nI'm Jasmine. Don't you recognize me? I\nwent to look for you before and found\nthat you had both passed out. I wanted\nto wake you up, but I don't know how I\npassed out, too. When I woke up, I was\nhere. Yong Donging was taken aback, then\nsuddenly looked at Sumu, his eyes almost\noverflowing with murderous intent. You\nbrought Jasmine in too. Faced with the\nkilling intent of a superhum, Sumu\nsmiled with interest. Interesting. Not\nonly does it possess the ability to\ntransform, but it can also read minds to\na certain extent. Most importantly, it\nalso has an intelligence reducing aura.\nAnswer me. Yong Donging, like a furious\ntiger, came up to Sumu, his fist\nclenched as if he were about to smash\nSumu s head in the next second. Sumu\nremained unhurried and said, \"Foolish\nperson, before you get angry, can you at\nleast think about which floor we are\non?\" Yong Doning was startled, a glimmer\nof reason appearing in his eyes. He\nstroed to the window and stared intently\nat Jasmine. How did you get up here? I\nclimbed up here. Yong Doning, why are\nyou being so fierce? Let me in. Climb\nup? Jasmine is so frail, and this\nthree-story house is covered in moss.\nHow could she possibly climb up? And how\ndid you know I was in this room on the\nthird floor? You damn monster. Jasmine\nlooked heartbroken, her face etched with\ndespair, small pearls falling from her\neyes as she clutched her chest tightly.\n\"Young Doning, why don't you believe\nme?\" Sumu watched with great interest,\nand he found that this fake Jasmine's\nacting skills were even better than the\nreal Jasmine's. Whoosh! Yong Donging\nslammed the curtains shut and ignored\nit. But the next second, Sumu pulled the\ncurtains back up. \"What are you doing?\nI'm curious about the behavior patterns\nof these monsters, and I'd also like to\nsee what she's capable of doing to trick\nme into opening the door,\" Sumu said\nwith a faint smile. Yong Doning gave him\na cold look, then turned away, not\nwanting to see him again. \"Young Doning,\nYong Doning,\" Jasmine called anxiously.\n\"Miss Jasmine, his heart is as hard as\nhis body, made of iron. I am different.\nI am always soft-hearted, especially\nunable to bear seeing a woman cry. Why\ndon't you try begging me?\" Sumu smiled.\nThis monster's ability to charm minds\nwas something he didn't know and he\nwanted to learn it. Perhaps it was\nSumu&lt;unk&gt;s words that caught Jasmine's\nattention because she stopped paying\nattention to Yong Donging and turned her\ngaze to Sumu. However, a look of\nconfusion appeared in those big eyes.\nSumu narrowed his eyes slightly. Didn't\nyou read my thoughts? It seems that\nhaving stronger mental power is still\nuseful. Jasmine's bewilderment lasted\nonly a moment before she wiped away her\ntears. A charming smile appearing on her\nface. She lightly bit her lip and began\nto drag things out without warning. Am I\nbeautiful? [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you. Yang Daing roared.\nPick it up. Pick up your clothes.\nWhoosh. The curtains were drawn again.\nSumu seemed to be deep in thought, but\nfailed to read my mind. So, he resorted\nto the simplest and most direct method,\nusing his beauty to seduce me. As his\neyes darted around, a plan formed in his\nmind. He said to Jasmine behind the\ncurtains, \"I yearn for transcendence. If\nyou can help me become a transcendent, I\ncan let you in. Upon hearing this, even\nthe enraged Yong Donging was stunned.\nWas he mistaking the nightmare monster\nfor a turtle in a wishing well?\nDon't&lt;unk&gt;t be so surprised since she\nwants to come in so much. It's&lt;unk&gt; not\ntoo much for me to make a small request,\nis it? Sumu shrugged. Jasmine remained\nsilent behind the curtains for a long\ntime without replying. Sumu raised an\neyebrow slightly, used his cane to lift\nthe curtain, only to find that the\nperson was gone. Damn it. Thump, thump,\nthump. This time it was a knock on the\ndoor. Mr. Sue, are you all right? I\nthink I heard a noise. Yanu&lt;unk&gt;s voice\nrang out from outside the door. It's all\nright. A villager came by just now, but\nhe's already gone. That's good. By the\nway, Mr. Su, I've made some new\ndiscoveries about this nightmare. Would\nyou mind coming inside to discuss it in\ndetail? Of course. Sumu gave Yong Dona a\nlook. Yong Doning pouted in\ndissatisfaction, walked to the door, and\nturned the door knob. With a creaking\nsound, the door opened. Roar! A\ndeafening roar rang out, and the door,\nwhich was only half open, was smashed\nopen with a loud crash. A ferocious\nfigure lunged at Yong Donging, knocking\nhim to the ground with tremendous force.\nIts sharp teeth aimed directly at his\nneck. Chapter 38 was just a little bit\naway. Click. The teeth clashed against\nYong Donging&lt;unk&gt;s hard neck, producing\na harsh, grinding sound. Yong Donging\nwas shocked and then realized that it\nwasn't Yuan Yu who had come in, but a\nvillager. He struggled violently, then\nsuddenly flipped over and pinned the\nvillager to the ground, unleashing a\nbarrage of punches that quickly smashed\nthe villager's head open. What on earth\nhappened? Yang Doning stood up, panting\nheavily, still somewhat shaken. A trace\nof blood had appeared on his neck. If he\nhadn't been made of steel, he would have\ndied from that blow. He looked at Sumu\nand found Sumu standing there with his\nhead down, his body trembling slightly.\nHe thought that the scene just now had\nfrightened Sumu. Before he could speak,\nSumu suddenly raised his head, his pale\nface filled with an excited grin. Yong\nDoning was startled. Ew, this is\namazing, huh? This is the feeling.\nSumu's expression became increasingly\nmanic, and an unnatural blush appeared\non his pale face. He looked at Yong\nDongching with burning eyes. This is the\nsurprise I wanted. You know, it was so\nclose. So very close. If I had opened\nthe door just now, I would be dead by\nnow. Unfortunately, I'm too weak. I\ndidn't want to take even one more step.\nUnexpectedly, this saved me from\ndisaster. Brilliant. Absolutely\nbrilliant. Haha. A madman. A complete\nand utter mad man. Yang Doning felt a\nchill for no reason. He suddenly felt\nthat he would rather face those\nnightmare monsters than share a room\nwith Sumu. At that moment, screams also\ncame from downstairs. There are still\nvillagers down there. Damn it. How did\nthese villagers get in? Weren't they\ntold they couldn't enter the house? Yong\nDoning&lt;unk&gt;s expression changed\ndrastically as he cursed. Instead of\ncursing here, why don't you go down and\ntake a look? Sumu's gentle voice rang\nout beside Yong Doning. Yong Doning\nsubconsciously turned around and saw\nSumu standing there with a smile on his\nface, leaning on a snake patterned\nwooden cane, looking as elegant as a\nnobleman. The frenzy I just experienced\nseemed like a hallucination. Damn it,\nthis lunatic. He cursed under his breath\nand then walked downstairs. Gunshots and\nscreams rang out. The area downstairs\nwas already a mess. About five villagers\nhad broken into the house and were\nfighting with the Viper gang members.\nSeveral corpses of Viper Gang underlings\nlay on the ground. Boom, boom, boom. One\nafter another, scorching fireballs shot\nout, burning the air and constantly\ndriving back the villagers. However, it\nwas all to no avail. As villagers\ncontinued to pour in, Sumu looked in the\ndirection the villagers had entered and\nsaw that they had come out of the toilet\non the first floor. Mr. Su, Mr. Yong,\nwatch out. Someone has broken the window\nof the first floor bathroom. Yion\nshouted anxiously when he saw Su Mu and\nYang coming downstairs out of the corner\nof his eye. Yong Donging&lt;unk&gt;s face grew\nincreasingly grim. He rushed forward,\nusing his steel body to repel the\nvillagers and clear the road, asking,\n\"Are you sure you didn't miss it during\nthe previous inspection?\" \"I'm sure,\"\nYionu shouted. \"I checked all the\nwindows in every room, including the\ntoilets.\" All the windows were\ndefinitely closed. The villagers\ncouldn't have broken the doors and\nwindows. So, it must have been someone\non our side who secretly broke the\nwindows. That's impossible. Who would be\ncrazy enough to let a wolf into the\nhouse? Are they out of their mind? As he\nsaid this, Yong Donging subconsciously\nglanced at Sumu. To be honest, if he\nhadn't been with Su all this time, he\nwould have absolutely believed that Su\nMu was capable of doing something so\ncrazy. Su Mu&lt;unk&gt;s smile deepened. It\nseems there's a traitor in our team. Mr.\nSu, now is not the time to look for\ntraitors. The most urgent thing is to\nbreak through the encirclement. It is no\nlonger safe here. Sumu nodded. Yong\nDonging, lead the way. Yong Dong&lt;unk&gt;s\nface darkened, but he did not disobey\norders. Instead, he roared, his muscles\nbulging and charged towards the\nvillagers. His steel-like steps made the\nentire corridor tremble slightly, and\neach step made a dull thud. He charged\ninto the crowd of villagers, his\nsteel-like body, ignoring the attacks.\nHis arms swung like giant hammers, and\nevery villager he touched suffered a\ncrushed chest and broken limbs. However,\nthese villagers completely ignored the\ninjuries and the pain. Even with their\nheads dented and necks broken, they\nstill roared and pounced on Yong Doning.\nIn just a few moments, Yong Doning was\ncovered in villagers who were tearing at\nhim frantically. Yifu and the Viper gang\nmembers didn't treat Yong Doning like a\nhuman being either, and they fired\nwildly at him. With everyone's combined\nefforts, the villagers clinging to Yong\nDoning were all shot down. The only\nconsequence was that Yong Donging had\nsome bullet holes and burn marks on his\nbody. He was made of steel, but that\ndidn't mean he couldn't feel pain. After\na barrage of attacks, he was already\ngrimacing in pain. Walk. Seeing that the\nvillagers had been driven back, Sumu\nimmediately gave an order. Xiao Chiao\nquickly came to his side, took out a\nfolding stretcher, and then carried Sumu\nout with the others following closely\nbehind. What no one noticed was that\namidst the chaos, the honestl looking\nmiddle-aged man, Li Chong, secretly\npicked up a pistol from the corpse of a\nmember of the Viper gang. When everyone\nrushed outside, they felt as if they had\nfallen into an ice cave because outside\nthey were met with a dense crowd of\nvillagers surging in like a tide. They\nstared blankly at the crowd, their eyes\npractically overflowing with malice. A\nlight drizzle began to fall from the\nsky, adding a touch of desolation to the\nscene. Upon seeing this scene, even\nYionu and Yong Donging, two\nextraordinary individuals, couldn't help\nbut show despair. There were simply too\nmany villagers. Even if the two of them\nwere exhausted to death, they would\nstill find it difficult to defeat them.\nAt this moment, Sumu felt his heart\nbeating again, something he hadn't done\nin a long time. In his dream, he had\nexperienced far more thrilling scenes\nthan the current predicament. But he\ncouldn't feel his heartbeat because he\nknew that dreams were all fake and that\nno matter how reckless he was, he\nwouldn't die. But things are different\nnow. Now you really can die. He was\nstarting to get a little excited.\nChapter 39, traitor, go back. Sumu's\ncalm voice rang out. Go back into the\nroom. Yanu was shocked. If we retreat\nnow, we will be surrounded and attacked\nby the villagers both inside and outside\nthe house. Wouldn't we become sitting\nducks? Sumu didn't have time to explain,\nnor did he care to. Yiani Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\ndisobedience to his orders did not mean\nthat others would disobey. Yong Donging\nand the members of the poisonous snake\ngang immediately retreated back into the\nhouse as instructed by Sumu. Yion&lt;unk&gt;s\nface turned extremely ugly upon seeing\nthis, but he couldn't face the group of\nvillagers outside alone. So, he had no\nchoice but to retreat back inside. Just\nas he was about to close the door, Sumu\nstopped him. Don't close the door. let\nthem in and go upstairs. Yanu was taken\naback, but then he saw that Sumu had\nalready started to go upstairs under the\nescort of the crowd, and he finally\nunderstood Su Mu&lt;unk&gt;s intention. The\nvillagers could only enter through the\nmain entrance on the first floor and the\nwindows of the toilet on the first\nfloor. If they could all be led to the\nfirst floor, they could jump out of the\nwindows on the upper floor and escape\nsuccessfully. Eion gave Su Moo's back a\nlong look, then followed him upstairs\nwithout closing the door. It wasn't\ndifficult to come up with the escape\nplan, but what was truly difficult was\nbeing able to react and calmly devise a\nsolution in such a short time when\nsurrounded by hundreds of villagers. Not\neveryone can do that. Most people panic\nwhen faced with danger and find it\ndifficult to make an accurate judgment\nimmediately. Soon, the crowd rushed up\nto the third floor while the villagers\nwho had poured into the house could only\ncatch up by taking the narrow staircase,\nwhich could only accommodate two people\nat a time. The villagers are difficult\nto deal with because of their large\nnumbers. In a one-on-one fight, either\nYionu or Yong Doning could defeat them.\nNow, thanks to the advantage of the\nterrain, the threat has been greatly\nreduced. Yong Doning will cover the\nrear. The rest of you jump out the\nwindow. Sumu ordered methodically.\nWithout hesitation, Yong Doning blocked\nthe stairwell alone. Facing two\nvillagers at once posed little threat to\nhim. He was the most suitable person to\ncover the rear. his steel body providing\nhim with a strong guarantee of survival.\nOne by one, the Viper gang members\njumped out of the third floor windows\nand landed on the muddy ground outside\nthe house. The infrastructure of Xiao\nfamily village was very backward. There\nwas no cement paving. Apart from the\nmain road, most of the ground was muddy.\nBasically, any healthy person could jump\nfrom the third floor without injury, let\nalone these elite members of the Viper\ngang. If we were to say who in the group\nmight be in danger if they jumped off\nthe building, it would probably only be\nSu Mu and the only woman, Wong Le. I I'm\nafraid of heights. The delicate Wong Lee\nsquatted by the window, gripping the\nwindow sill tightly with both hands. She\nglanced at the ground and felt a wave of\ndizziness. Get out of here. Xiao Xiao\nkicked her slender waist from behind.\nOh. With a piercing scream, Wong fell\nout of the window and landed on the\nmuddy ground. Boss, please. Xiao Chaya\nrespectfully helped Su Moo to the\nwindow, then shouted to the Viper gang\nmembers downstairs, \"Get ready to catch\nthe boss.\" \"Yes!\" The remaining eight\nViper gang members quickly formed a\ncircle, then took off their shirts,\nstretched out their hands, and clasped\nthem together, forming a human net. The\nclothes were placed on top of these\ncrossed arms to provide cushioning.\nHowever, Sumu did not jump down\nimmediately, but instead admired the\nscenery by the window. Hurry. I\ncan't&lt;unk&gt;t hold on any longer. Only\nwhen Yong Doning shouted urgently from\nbehind did Su take off his brown\nglasses, take the snake patterned wooden\ncane, and lightly leap from the window,\nfinally landing safely on the human net.\nWong Lee, who was dizzy and disoriented\nfrom the fall, saw this scene but dared\nnot say anything in anger. Ziao Xiao Yao\nand Yiong Yu quickly jumped out of the\nwindow to escape, followed by Yong\nDonging, who was covered in wounds. As\nsoon as Yong Doning jumped down, several\narms with bulging veins stretched out of\nthe window and several villagers crowded\naround the window, shouting violently,\n\"Hurry up! This house can't hold the\nvillagers for long,\" Ephanu said, still\nshaken. He pointed to a two-story\nbuilding not far away. \"Let's make do in\nthis house for now. Go to the east end\nof the village.\" \"What?\" Eanu was taken\naback. \"I said go to the east end of the\nvillage,\" Sumu said calmly. \"Mr. Su, why\nare we going to such lengths? There are\nhouses nearby where we can take shelter.\nWhy go all the way to the east end of\nthe village? Ephanu asked puzzled. Sumu\ngripped the temples of his glasses with\nboth hands. Slowly put on the brown\ntinted glasses and hid his eyes behind\nthe lenses. Mr. Yei, it's hard for me to\nexplain to you with your intelligence.\nYou just need to follow me. Yionify\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s face was gloomy, his fists\nclenched, but given Su Mu&lt;unk&gt;s\ncomposure in the face of danger, he\nultimately chose to remain silent. The\ngroup sped along, dealing with several\nlone villagers before finally arriving\nsafely at the east end of the village.\nThe eastern end of the village is\nextremely remote and desolate with only\na small, dilapidated house on the roof,\nwhich is so simple that it couldn't be\nsimpler. Yionu stood in front of the\nthatched hut, his face extremely grim.\nMr. Sue, is this the house you chose?\nPutting aside whether this house can\naccommodate so many people, just looking\nat the quality of the house, I even have\ndoubts about it. Mr. Yei, I find it hard\nto imagine how you survived three\nnightmare worlds. Sumu interrupted\ncalmly. He was standing under a black\numbrella with Xiao Xiao Yao dressed in a\nblack suit and holding the umbrella\nbeside him. When it rains, you naturally\nneed to use an umbrella. Yanu&lt;unk&gt;s face\ngrew increasingly gloomy. Sumu continued\nin the silhouette of time. Do you\nremember what the village chief's son\nsaid? Never mind. I guess you probably\ndon't remember either. The village\nchief's son said, \"Ever since you were\nimprisoned, that old dog has been\nguarding your dilapidated thatched hut,\nrefusing to eat or drink. It's&lt;unk&gt; long\ndead. Where am I supposed to find dog\nmeat? At most, I can get you a couple of\ndog bones. Do you understand now?\" Yonu\nwas taken aback. You mean this\ndilapitated thatched hut is Ting&lt;unk&gt;s\nhome? Sumu nodded. You hesitated to jump\nfrom the third floor because you were\nlooking for this house. Snap, snap,\nsnap. Sumu smiled and clapped. Mr. Yei,\nyou really get it right away. I'm\nstarting to believe you really did\nexperience the nightmare world three\ntimes. Huh? Yanu grinned, a forced smile\non his face. If I'm not mistaken, the\nkey to solving this nightmare should be\nin this thatched hot. Sumu pushed up his\nbrown glasses and suddenly changed the\nsubject. However, before that, we need\nto find the person who secretly broke\nthe window. Upon hearing this,\neveryone's expressions turned serious,\nand they looked at each other. For a\nmoment, the only sound in the air was\nthe pattering of raindrops on everyone.\nYeon, you sharp gaze swept over everyone\nbefore finally landing on the members of\nthe Viper gang. Mr. Sue, I think the\ntraitor might be in your team. Chapter\n40. I can't stand seeing women cry. Oh,\nhow do you know? Sumu asked with\ninterest. We entered the nightmare world\nahead of time and stayed together for 3\ndays without any problems. But you all\ncame in and Yion didn't finish his\nsentence, but the meaning was already\nclear. This is impossible. We could not\nhave betrayed our leader. Xiao Xiao\nglared angrily as if his faith had been\ninsulted. Yionu didn't speak, but\nsilently looked at Su. Sumu smiled\nfaintly and walked to Xiao Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s\nside. Chief, you must trust us. We would\nnever betray you. Don't worry, I know.\nSumu smiled and reached out to take a\npistol from Ziao Chaya&lt;unk&gt;s waist.\nClick. The sound of a bullet being\nchambered rang out. Actually, I already\nknow who the traitor is. Sumu slowly\nslid the gun in his hand in front of\neveryone's eyes and then landed in front\nof Yong Doning. Yong Doning frowned\nimmediately. You doubt me, huh? If it\nwere me, make way. Sumu shook his gun in\nannoyance, signaling Yong Doning to move\naway. Yong Donging was taken aback, then\nstepped aside, revealing Yi Fanu behind\nhim. Yiong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s muscles tensed\nimmediately, and his eyes narrowed\nslightly. Mr. Su, this joke is not\nfunny. Sumu frowned slightly. You move\naside, too. Yanu was also stunned. He\nrealized something and immediately\nstepped aside. This time, the person who\nwas revealed was Wong Lee, who had been\nhiding behind the crowd. When the\ndelicate Wong Le saw that everyone's\neyes were on her, she turned pale with\nfright. She quickly turned around,\nhoping that there was someone behind her\nand that Sumu would ask her to move\naside, but no one did. There was no one\nbehind her. Wong Le's face turned even\npaler. She frantically waved her hands.\nNo, it wasn't me. How could I break the\nwindow and let those monsters in? I\nwould die, too. Yonu looked at her with\na questioning gaze. Mr. Su, are you\nmistaken? With her courage, it's&lt;unk&gt;\nimpossible for her to damage the doors\nand windows. Yes. Why are you so sure it\nwas me? What proof do you have? Wong Le\ncried out as if grasping at a straw.\nSumu smiled and pointed his gun at Wong\nLe, saying, \"Of course.\" He paused for a\nmoment. The evidence is that when I was\nabout to jump, you deliberately delayed\nme by the window, preventing me from\njumping. Upon hearing this, everyone was\nstunned. What kind of evidence was this?\nI didn't deliberately delay. I'm just\nafraid of heights. Is that my fault?\nWong Lee argued vehemently. \"You all be\nthe judge. He's clearly blaming me for\nwasting his time. He's retaliating\nagainst me. Yionu didn't speak but felt\na chill in his heart. This Su Mu was\nsimply a madman wanting to kill Wong Lee\nfor this reason alone. But he didn't\nstop him. It would be irrational to make\nan enemy of Su Mu for the sake of an\nordinary person. Even Yion didn't\nsupport Wong Lee, so naturally no one\nelse would stand up for her. Wong Le's\nface turned ashen and she stared at\neveryone in disbelief. You You can't do\nthis to me. Why? Why can't I even be\nafraid of heights? Only Yong Dona looked\nreluctant and was about to speak when Su\nMu continued. Wong Le is indeed afraid\nof heights. But you are not. Wong\nLe&lt;unk&gt;s expression froze. What are you\ntalking about? I am Wong Le. Tsktisk. A\nmocking smile appeared on Su Mu&lt;unk&gt;s\nface. Is your acting really that good?\nSeeing your superb performance, I'm even\nthinking of signing you. I happen to own\na film and television company.\nUnfortunately, even if a nightmare\nmonster like you were to sign a\ncontract, it probably wouldn't be\nlegally recognized, right? A nightmare\nmonster? Yonu&lt;unk&gt;s expression changed\nslightly. Mr. Su, are you saying that\nthe real Wong Lee is dead? And this\nperson in front of you is a villager in\ndisguise. Sumu shook his head. I'm more\ninclined to believe that she is Wong\nLee, just Wong Lee who has become a\nvillager. Wong Lee, who became a\nvillager? Have you ever considered that\nthe villagers were once human and now\nthey've become nightmare monsters? Wong\nLei was also once human, so why couldn't\nshe change? Wong Lei frantically waved\nher arms as if trying to clear herself\nof suspicion. I'm not. I've been with\nyou guys the whole time. How could I\npossibly become a nightmare monster?\nDon't make false accusations. At this\nmoment, Lie Chong, who was standing to\nthe side, seemed to have thought of\nsomething, and his face suddenly turned\nugly. You have not always been with us.\nWhen you met Mr. Su before, you ran back\nby yourself. The atmosphere instantly\nbecame tense upon hearing this. Yianu\nand Yong Doning both distanced\nthemselves from Wong Le, staring at her\nmenacingly. \"You guys, I'm really not a\nmonster. Sob sobb.\" Wong Le started\nshedding small pearls without saying a\nword. \"Sigh, I can't stand seeing women\ncry,\" Sumu said with pity. \"So, you\nshould just die.\" He slowly raised his\npistol and aimed it at Wong Le&lt;unk&gt;'s\nhead. Terrified, Wong Lei dared not cry\nanymore and kept covering her head with\nher hands, trying to block the bullets\nin this ridiculous way. Don't kill me.\nThis is just your guess. You have no\nproof whatsoever that I am nightmare.\nNo, I do, Sumu said calmly. If you take\na shot from me and you die, then you are\nWong Lee. If you don't die, then you are\na villager. Wong Le's expression at this\nmoment was beyond words. shock, anger,\nfear, disbelief. All sorts of complex\nemotions were mixed on her small face.\nIt was hard to imagine that a human face\ncould hold so many emotions at the same\ntime. I I'm dead. It was wrongly. What\nif you're wrong? Did I die for nothing?\nYou were wrong. But even though you're\ndead, at least you left your innocence\nbehind. Sumu shrugged. Innocence. I\nbang. The loud gunshot temporarily\ndrowned out the sound of the rain and a\nmetal bullet pierced through the rain\ncurtain and accurately struck Wong Le's\nsmooth forehead. Wong Le's voice stopped\nabruptly and she collapsed to the\nground. Yionu was startled not by the\ngunshot but by Sumu. He had experienced\nthree nightmare worlds and believed that\nhe had lost his conscience and could not\nbe called a good person. But now he\nsuddenly felt that he was a good person.\nAt least he would not be so indifferent\nto human life. Sumuyu. Yong Donging\nglared at him, but a non-human roar\ninterrupted him. Roar. Chapter 41.\nDumplings. A ferocious roar came from\nWong Le's corpse. The next moment, the\nalready dead Wong Le stood up without\nusing her hands to support herself, just\nstanding straight up. His pale face was\nexpressionless, except for a pair of\neyes filled with burning malice, just\nlike the villagers. \"What? It really is\nher?\" Yong Donging exclaimed in\nsurprise, not expecting that Su Mu had\nactually guessed correctly. In fact,\nonly Su Mu himself knew that he was not\nguessing, but was 100% certain that Wong\nLe had become a monster because his\nhypnosis had failed. When he tried to\nhypnotize Wong Le, he encountered the\nsame reaction as the villagers he was\ntrying to hypnotize. Roar! Wong Le\nroared as she charged toward Eionu, who\nwas closest to her. Yion&lt;unk&gt;s\nexpression darkened slightly and he\nquickly clenched his right hand into a\ngun shape, aiming it at Wong Le.\nFive-finger flame bullet. Bang! Bang!\nBang! Three scorching fireballs roared\nout, exploding into intense flames on\nWong Le's body. In just a moment, Wong\nLe was engulfed by the terrifying flames\nand burned into a desiccated corpse.\nAfter dealing with Wong Le, Yanu walked\nto Su Mu&lt;unk&gt;s side and asked in a low\nvoice, \"Mr. Su, what exactly happened?\nWhy did Wong Lei suddenly turn into a\nvillager? As far as I know, the\nvillagers don't seem to have the means\nto transform humans into their own kind.\nEveryone who is captured by the\nvillagers ends up being torn apart and\neaten. Sumu smiled slightly. Where do\nyou think those people who were pulled\ninto the darkness by the shadows\nultimately went? A shadowy figure.\nEphanu was stunned. Could the shadowy\nfigure be the culprit that turned the\nvillagers into monsters? I'm just\nguessing right now, but maybe the answer\nis in this room. Sumu pointed to the\nthatched hut in front of him with his\nsnakeskin cane. \"Young Donging,\" he\ncalled softly. \"Yong Dongqing took the\nlead and entered the thatched hut\nwithout even needing Sumu to give\nspecific instructions, clearly\nindicating that he had been well\ntrained.\" \"Bang!\" The door of the\nthatched hut was opened and Yong\nDongqing entered. After looking around\nand seeing that there was no danger, he\ninvited everyone to come in. After Sumu\nentered, his scrutinizing gaze swept\naround through his brown tinted glasses.\nThe interior furnishings were all old,\nconsisting of only a wooden recliner, a\nlarge square table with peeling paint,\nand an old-fashioned cabinet against the\nwall. One side of the main room is the\nbedroom with simple patterns carved on\nthe bed frame, and some children's\ndoodles. Although the bedding is faded,\nit is clean and tidy. Further inside is\nthe kitchen, where a large earthn stove\noccupies one corner. Pots, pans, and\nbowls are placed on the stove, and dry\nfirewood is piled up next to it. The\nwalls are blackened by smoke. Although\nthe house was dilapidated, it had all\nthe necessary facilities. Just then, the\nroar of villagers could be heard not far\nfrom the door. Yeanu&lt;unk&gt;s expression\nchanged. Oh no, those villagers are\ncatching up. Bang. He quickly closed the\ndoor and peered through the crack at the\napproaching villagers, his heart\npounding in his chest. The main reason\nwas that the house was too dilapidated.\nEven the door was made of solid wood and\ncouldn't close properly. He seriously\ndoubted whether the door could actually\nkeep the villagers out. Fortunately, the\nvillagers stopped when they reached the\ndoor. \"Cull yeu breathed a sigh of\nrelief. It's blocked.\" He turned around\nand was stunned to see Su Mu taking out\na plate of dumplings from the\nold-fashioned cabinet. The dumplings\nseemed to have been sitting for a while.\nThey were no longer glistening and\nplump, but rather dry and wrinkled. The\ndumplings were pressed against each\nother, and some were slightly deformed.\nThe juice from the dumpling filling\nseeped into the plate, pooling into a\nmurky liquid that emitted a faint,\nunpleasant odor. These are dumplings.\nEuanu swallowed hard. In the real world,\nhe would definitely throw away dumplings\nthat looked like this, but he was really\nhungry now. Is it edible? Li Chong,\nstanding to the side, also stared\nwideeyed. Sumu smiled and placed the\ndumplings on the table. Please help\nyourselves if you would like some.\nYionifu and Li Chong gathered around,\nstaring intently at the dumplings and\nswallowing hard. Sumu and the others\narrived relatively late, and although\nthey were somewhat hungry, it wasn't\nunbearable. There are 12 dumplings in\ntotal. I still need to fight, so I'll\nget eight, and you get four. Yanu didn't\ndiscuss it with Li Chong, but decided on\nthe distribution of dumplings directly.\nAlthough Li Chong longed to eat more, he\ndidn't dare to object. He stared at the\ndumplings and nodded. \"You eat first,\"\nEiffon said. Li Chong hesitated. In such\na strange place, a plate of dumplings of\nunknown origin appeared. Who would dare\nto eat them directly? Hurry up. Yionu\nurged impatiently. Li Chong stealed his\nheart. So what if he died? This damn\nplace. Even if he died, he would die\nwith a full stomach. He grabbed the\ndumplings from the plate and stuffed\nthem into his mouth like pigies\nswallowing a jinseng fruit and ate four\ndumplings in one go. After finishing his\nmeal, he looked at the remaining\ndumplings with a lingering sense of\nsatisfaction. Although the dumplings\nwere a bit spoiled, they were an\nunparalleled delicacy for him who had\nbeen starving for 3 days. Eion was very\ncautious. He carefully observed Li\nChongs reaction and waited for a long\ntime. Only after seeing that Li Chong\nwas really not abnormal did he feel\nrelieved and slowly started eating\ndumplings while still observing Li\nChong. After eating eight dumplings,\nEion finally felt alive again. Mr. Su,\nwhy are there dumplings here? Euphonu\nasked. Sumu&lt;unk&gt;s behavior just now made\nhim realize the gap between his\nintelligence and that of the other man.\nBecause Ting loves dumplings, and this\nis Tinking&lt;unk&gt;s home, Sumu explained\nwith a smile. Then, Yionu had only\nuttered one word when his expression\nsuddenly changed drastically. Not only\nthat, even Yong Donging and the others\nchanged their expressions. In an\ninstant, everyone's eyes were focused on\nthe wooden bed in the bedroom. Because\nthe wooden bed had just made a dull\nthud, as if someone had hit the bed\nframe with their head. Who is it? Come\nout. Ye&lt;unk&gt;s expression was tense. His\nright hand was already clenched into a\ngun shape, and flames kept shooting out\nbetween his index fingers, causing the\ntemperature in the room to continue to\nrise. Xiao Xiao Yao and the others also\ndrew their machetes from their waists.\nThey had almost run out of bullets from\ntheir previous battle with the\nvillagers. In this somber atmosphere, a\ndark shadow seemed to be trembling under\nthe bed. \"Come out quickly!\" Yionu\nshouted again, and the fireballs at his\nfingertips were almost shot out. Just\nthen, a snakeskin cane blocked his way.\nYionu looked at Su Mu with a puzzled\nexpression. \"Mr. Su!\" Sumu shook his\nhead at him, signaling him to put down\nthe gun. Yan Yu extinguished the flame\nat his fingertips, while Sumu took a\nstep forward and whispered to the area\nunder the bed, \"Ting! We're not bad\npeople. Come out. Tinking. Everyone was\nstartled. Could it be Tinking under the\nbed? As expected, the shadowy figure\nunder the bed stopped trembling\nimmediately upon hearing these words. A\nmoment later, a timid little girl's\nvoice came from under the bed. Are you\nreally not bad people? You really won't\nhurt Tinking. Chapter 42. Grandma is\nwatching you. Everyone froze again. The\nvoice was wrong. Tinting was clearly a\nyoung girl, but the voice from under the\nbed was that of a little girl.\nSumu&lt;unk&gt;s smile grew even gentler, like\nthat of a kind older brother next door.\nHis tone was soft yet firm, and every\nword seemed carefully chosen. \"Ting Ting\nis a good child. Of course, we won't\nhurt her.\" After hesitating for a long\ntime, the dark figure under the bed\nfinally crawled out. She was a little\ngirl of about 6 years old, with her jet\nblack hair casually tied into two small\nbraids. It was a little messy, but\nnatural. She was very thin but had a\nlively and agile figure like a little\ndeer in the mountains. She had a round\nface with a slight blush, a mark left by\nfrequent exposure to the sun. Her eyes\nwere large and bright, like clear\nmountain streams, pure and flawless. Her\nlong eyelashes were like two small fans,\nfluttering gently in the blink of an\neye. The little girl, dressed in\ntattered clothes, looked timidly at the\npeople in the room, her dirty little\nhands nervously clutching the photo\nframe in her hands. The group remained\nvigilant. Given the recent incident\ninvolving Wong Lee, no one could\nguarantee that the little girl wouldn't\nsuddenly transform into a monster like\nthe villagers. I just felt that the\nlittle girl in front of me did look\nsomewhat similar to Tinking from before.\nMr. Sue, this little girl is quite a bit\nyounger than Tinking. Could they be\nsisters? Yanu asked in a deep voice. No,\nshe is Tinking. Yianu was even more\nsurprised. How did you know? Sumu gave\nhim a strange look. This is Ting&lt;unk&gt;s\nhouse. So naturally, Tinking lives here.\nIs that so strange? Uh, Yionu was\nmomentarily speechless. Tinking, why are\nyou hiding under the bed? Sumu asked\nwith a gentle smile. The little girl,\nTing, said nervously. I heard some noise\noutside, so I hid because I was scared.\nThere are bad people outside, and they\nwill bully Tinking. As Tinking spoke,\nher eyes caught sight of the empty plate\nof dumplings on the wooden table. Her\nlips trembled and her big eyes filled\nwith tears. Those are the dumplings\nGrandma left for me. Li Chong, who had\njust eaten dumplings, scratched his head\nawkwardly. Yanu didn't take it\nseriously, but instead looked wary.\nGrandma, where is your grandma? Thinking\nlooked a little surprised and agrieved.\nShe stretched out her dirty little hand\nand pointed behind everyone. Grandma is\nright there. Yea was startled and turned\naround abruptly, only to see a wooden\nrocking chair with no one on it.\nStrangely, the rocking chair was rocking\non its own without any wind, making\ncreaking sounds. He felt a tingling\nsensation on his scalp, and a chill ran\nup his spine, making his hair stand on\nend. Sumu narrowed his eyes slightly.\nTing, good children don't lie. Tinking\npouted unhappily, and her innocent,\nchildish voice rang out. Tinking didn't\nlie. Grandma is clearly lying in the\nrocking chair. She's looking at you\nright now, and she's even greeting you.\nEveryone stared in horror at the empty\nrocking chair that was still swaying. A\nsense of indescribable fear rising in\ntheir hearts. Yiu and Yong Donging, both\nextraordinary individuals, were on high\nalert, their foreheads covered in cold\nsweat. Their eyes kept scanning Tinting\nand the rocking chair, completely unsure\nwhich side to confront. They were\ncapable of fighting the villagers, but\nthey were also afraid of these unseen\nand bizarre monsters. It's like someone\nwith a hunting rifle being asked to\nchoose between facing a bear and a\nghost. Without hesitation, they would\nchoose the bear. In such a tense and\neerie atmosphere, Sumu smiled politely\nat the rocking chair and said, \"Hello,\nGrandma.\" The abrupt greeting evoked an\nuncontrollable sense of unease in\neveryone present. Yong Donging asked\nnervously in a low voice, \"Can you see\nit?\" Sumu smiled slightly. I can't see\nit, but as a junior, I should definitely\nrespond to the greeting of an elder so\nas not to appear impolite. Madman, Yang\nDoning once again labeled Su Mu with a\nnew tag. A gentleman with a touch of\nmadness. At that moment, a silvery laugh\nrang out. Grandma praised you for being\na very polite young man. Ting seemed to\nhave forgotten about the dumplings, and\na naive smile appeared on her face. Sumu\nsmiled politely and nodded to the\nrocking chair in a very gentlemanly\nmanner. Thank you for the compliment.\nYou are also a very kind elder. The\natmosphere grew increasingly eerie. To\neveryone else, Sumu seemed to be talking\nto thin air, even though the rocking\nchair was completely empty. Grandma\nsaid, \"It's getting dark and there might\nbe shadowy figures outside, so you can\nstay here. Is it getting dark?\" Everyone\nhurriedly looked out the window and\nfound that the sky had been covered with\na layer of gloom, just like their gloomy\nmood. Clang. A crisp metallic clang drew\neveryone's attention. It was the sound\nof Sumu opening his dark gold pocket\nwatch. He checked the time, 3:00 in the\nafternoon. It gets dark really fast. He\nput away his pocket watch, the dark gold\nUro&lt;unk&gt;'s pattern flashing briefly\nbefore everyone's eyes. Then he\nexpressed his gratitude to the rot tan\nchair. Grandma, then we'll take our\nleave. A moment later, everyone huddled\nin a corner far away from the rocking\nchair and kept their eyes fixed on it.\nMeanwhile, Ting was obediently playing\nwith a rag doll in the bedroom,\nconstantly combing its hair with a small\nwooden comb. The sky darkened at a\nvisible speed. The only sound in the\nroom was the creaking of the rocking\nchair. Mr. Sue, it's getting dark. Let's\nleave quickly. This place is too eerie,\nYion said in a low voice. Is it weird?\nCute tinking kind mother-in-law. This\nplace is clearly very safe. Sumu was\nenjoying the peaceful atmosphere. Mr.\nSue, this is not the time for jokes.\nThere must be some strange connection\nbetween Tinking and the Tinking in the\nTime silhouette. And that old woman, you\ncan't even see her. How do you know\nshe's kind? Yanu roared. Isn't it kind\nof my mother-in-law to take in homeless\npeople like us? You expression turned\nangry, but he dared not leave alone.\nJust then, creek creek. The creaking of\nthe rocking chair stopped. Everyone\ntinced up instantly because they all\nknew that the rocking chair stopping\nmeant. Grandma had gotten off. Who knows\nwhere an invisible person might go?\nPerhaps she has already come up to you,\nstaring at you intently without moving,\na kind smile on her wrinkled face.\nSizzle. The candles on the table\nspontaneously combusted, illuminating a\nfaint glow. It's getting dark. Those bad\nguys are gone. The little girl tinting\nskipped out of the room and said to the\nair beside her, \"Grandma, I'm going out\nto find my sister.\" Chapter 43. Su Mu\nwas taken away by the shadowy figure.\nEveryone felt a chill run down their\nspines and stared nervously at the air\nbeside them. Although there was no one\nthere, they knew that a kind old woman\nwas standing there quietly. Soon,\nTinting skipped and hopped out the door.\nAt this moment, Sumu stood up and said\nto the air beside him, \"Grandma, it's\ngetting dark and my eyesight isn't very\ngood. Please forgive me if I bump into\nyou.\" After saying that, he went to the\nbedroom where the little girl had been\nunder everyone's gaze. When he came out\nagain, he was holding a photo frame. It\nwas the same photo frame that the little\ngirl had been holding in her hand. He\nflipped the photo frame over to the\nfront and what came into view was a\nyellowed black and white photo, a family\nportrait. There are four people in the\nphoto. An old woman with a full head of\nwhite hair, a frail face, and a hunched\nback. A girl named Tinking who looks a\nlittle younger, and a woman named\nTinking who looks a little younger. As\nfor the other two, they had no heads at\nall. Their necks were completely\nsevered. They could only be identified\nas a man and a woman from their clothes\nand other parts of their bodies. They\nlooked quite young and they were holding\nTing&lt;unk&gt;s hands on either side.\nTing&lt;unk&gt;s face was beaming with a happy\nsmile. Eionu leaned closer, looking at\nthe strange photo in front of him. This\nman and woman should be Ting&lt;unk&gt;s\nparents, but why are they headless? Sumu\nlooked puzzled. It's not that the\nparents are missing heads. The point is\nthat there's one person missing from\nthis photo. Who? Yanu&lt;unk&gt;s expression\nshifted. little sister. Sumu adjusted\nhis brown tinted glasses and said\ncalmly, \"Ting just said she was going\nout to look for her little sister, but\nshe's not in this family photo. So, the\nquestion is, who is she?\" Yianu&lt;unk&gt;s\nexpression grew increasingly grim, and\nthe strange feeling in his heart\nintensified. By this time, it was\ncompletely dark, and the empty rocking\nchair began to rock again. Creek, creek.\nEveryone stared nervously at the rocking\nchair as it swayed back and forth.\nSuddenly, an old voice rang out. Sleep\nsoundly in the dim night fog. The\nwhispers of demons linger around you.\nMoonlight peaks through the window\ncracks and dark shadows stalk and chase\nyou from the corners. Everyone was\nshocked and instinctively gripped their\nweapons tighter. Is this singing? Eionu\nasked, his brows furrowed. Lullabi Sumu\nsquinted, gazing at the rocking chair as\nthe song continued. The wind blows. The\ncandle light flickers. The embrace of\ndarkness is quiet. Close your eyes and\ndon't run around. Fear slowly burns in\nyour heart. Sleep. Sleep, baby. Don't\nwake up. A dark shadow lurks in the\ncorner, silent and still. Sleep, sleep.\nDon't open your eyes wide. There's a\nhand in the darkness inviting you to\ncross the bridge. Sleep. Sleep. Close\nyour eyes and don't hide. Your soul is\nlost and cannot find liberation. Sleep\nsoundly through the night. Don't ask\nwhether it's real or unreal until dawn\nbreaks and the nightmare will turn away.\nThe simple melody paired with an aged\nvoice carried an eerie quality in the\ndim night. As everyone listened to the\neerie song, they all had the feeling\nthat an invisible hand was stroking\ntheir scalp in the darkness. Unbeknownst\nto anyone, as the song began, a shadow\nquietly rose in a corner of the room\nwhere the candle light couldn't reach.\nIt rose higher and higher, eventually\nslowly transforming into a human figure.\nWhat does this song lyric mean? Eionu\nfelt inexplicably annoyed. This strange\nenvironment made him very uncomfortable\nand he subconsciously asked Sumu. But\nthe moment he turned to look at Sumu,\nhis scalp tingled, his face changed\ndrastically and he retreated rapidly to\ncreate distance between himself and\nSumu. A shadowy figure. He retreated\nabruptly to the corner of the room. His\nright hand clenched into a gun shape,\npointing it firmly at Sumu's back.\nEveryone was shocked and quickly looked\nat Sumu only to see a long-armed thin\nhumanoid shadow standing strangely\nbehind him. Leader Ziao Xiao cried out\nin alarm, raising his machete. Sumu,\nbehind you. Yang Donging stared intently\nat the dark figure behind Sumu, not\ndaring to make a move. Sumu didn't turn\naround, but instead smiled faintly.\nBehind me, Mr. Su, the shadowy figure\nhas already targeted you. Quickly, have\nsomeone else replace you. Yanu shouted\nurgently. However, Sumu did not arrange\nfor his underlings to die in his place.\nInstead, he calmly turned around, his\ntall, thin, dark figure reflected in his\nbrown glasses. At this moment, the dark\nfigure stretched out its thin, withered\narm towards Sumu. \"Are you inviting me?\"\nSumu asked. The shadowy figure didn't\nanswer, but instead stretched its hand\neven further forward, the sharp\nfingertips formed by the shadow almost\ntouching the brown glasses on its face.\nSumu smiled slightly and extended his\nhand to the shadowy figure. I accept\nyour invitation. The next moment, a fair\nand slender hand tightly grasped the\nhand of the dark figure. Everyone was\nshocked. Leader Sumuyu. Sumu turned\naround and smiled at everyone. The faint\ncandle light shone on his face and the\ncandle light reflected on his brown\nglasses making them flicker slightly.\nDon't worry, the answer is hidden in\nthat lullabi. After saying that, he\nclosed his eyes and walked into the\ndarkness hand in hand with the shadowy\nfigure. Everyone stared blankly at Sumu\nas he disappeared into the darkness,\nlost in thought for a long time. A\ndeathly silence fell over the room.\nAfter a long while, Yong Doning said,\n\"Although he is a mad man, I don't&lt;unk&gt;t\nthink he would want to die.\" He just\nsaid that the answer is hidden in the\nlullabi. Perhaps he has discovered\nsomething. A thoughtful look flashed in\nYion&lt;unk&gt;s eyes. The lyrics of that\nlullabi say, \"Don't open your eyes wide.\nThere's a hand in the darkness trying to\ninvite you across the bridge and then\nclose your eyes and don't hide, for the\nsoul is lost and cannot find\nliberation.\" The phrase a hand in the\ndarkness likely refers to a shadow. So\nclosing your eyes and not hiding might\nbe the way to deal with it. It's&lt;unk&gt;\npossible. Sumu did close his eyes just\nnow. Oh, Mr. Su actually risked his life\nfor a single lyric. This This is simply\nYionu hesitated, not finishing his\nsentence. Yang Doning spoke for him.\nHe's simply insane, isn't he? That's\nright. He's insane. It's not surprising\nthat he's capable of anything. You\nbastard. How dare you insult the leader?\nThe leader has his own plans for what he\nwants to do. How dare you gossip about\nhim behind his back? Xiao Xiao Yao\nglared angrily. Yong Doning gave him a\ncold look and ignored this person who\nhad already been brainwashed and made\nstupid. Now is not the time to argue.\nThe best we can do now is to split up\nand go out to find candles and food. The\nappearance of the shadowy figure means\nthat this place is no longer safe, Yion\nsuggested. The group looked at each\nother and finally agreed to Yionu's\nsuggestion. Chapter 44. Illusion. In the\ndarkness, Sumu kept his eyes closed,\nholding the large, slender, cold, and\nhard hand formed by shadow. Those\nweren't human hands at all. They looked\nmore like the hands holding the corpse\nof some kind of monster. Because his\neyes were closed, Sumu was unable to\nknow his surroundings. Although his\nspirit was strong, it was not strong\nenough to replace his eyes. He was like\na blind man led by a shadow slowly\nmoving forward. Here, time seemed to\nlose its meaning. He couldn't perceive\nthe passage of time at all. It felt like\nhe had walked for a long time, yet also\nlike he had only walked for a short\nwhile. The surroundings were completely\nsilent. There was no sound of the\nshadowy figure or his own footsteps.\nGradually, Sumu heard the sound of water\nbeneath his feet, but the sound was\nsomewhat muffled. Not like walking on\nrain, but more like stepping on some\nkind of thicker liquid. Blood. Sumu made\ncasual guesses, feeling no panic\nwhatsoever, but rather a faint sense of\nanticipation. He had previously seen\nTinking holding hands with a shadowy\nfigure in the silhouette of time and\nguessed that the shadowy figure was\npulling people into the darkness,\nperhaps not to kill them directly. It's\na very simple logic. If Tinking were\nkilled by the shadowy figure, she would\nmost likely turn into a monster like\nWong Lee, who is also a villager.\nHowever, Tinting was not seen among the\nvillagers. Moreover, Tinking in the time\ntravel silhouette clearly recognizes the\nshadowy figure and even speaks with it.\nAre you the nightmare grandma talked\nabout? This statement indicates that\nTinking had learned of the existence of\nthe shadowy figure from her grandmother\na long time ago. The lullabi that\nGrandma just sang was probably the one\nshe sings to her every night. Why wasn't\nTinking turned into a monster by the\nshadow? It's probably because she\nlistened to her grandmother, closed her\neyes, and walked away handin hand with\nthe shadow. That's why Sumu chose to go\nwith the shadowy figure. He wouldn't\nlive for more than a few days. According\nto his thinking, even if he couldn't\nbecome a superhuman, perhaps becoming a\nnightmare monster like the villagers\nwouldn't be bad since the villagers\nbodies were very strong and difficult to\nkill. As time ticked by, Sumu noticed\nthat the sounds around him were becoming\nclearer, and he could even hear the wind\nwhistling past. Thump. He stepped onto\nthe hard ground. There was no sound of\nwater. As he continued forward, he\ndiscovered that the ground was sloping\nupwards and had an arc, a bridge. He\nremembered the song that said there was\na hand in the darkness wanting to pull\nyou across the bridge. He continued to\nfollow the shadowy figure. After the\nground rose to a certain height, it\nbegan to descend again as if he were\ngoing down a bridge. He quickly stepped\noff the bridge and then he heard voices\naround him. Leader Sumu recognized the\nvoice. He clearly remembered it as the\nvoice of the underling who had been\ndragged away by the shadowy figure\nearlier. The younger brother sounded\nvery excited, as if he hadn't expected\nto see the leader here. Chief, have you\ncome to save me? A hurried running sound\ncame from the darkness, clearly from a\nhenchman. However, Sumu ignored him and\ndid not open his eyes. Instead, a smile\nof interest appeared on his lips.\n\"Interesting, chief, why aren't you\nsaying anything? Open your eyes and look\nat me.\" The henchman's voice was even\ncloser this time, almost right next to\nSumu&lt;unk&gt;s ear. Sumu frowned slightly\nbut kept his eyes closed. Get lost. The\nunderling's footsteps faltered, his\nvoice trembling with a hint of\nresentment. Leader, are you going to\nabandon me? I've always followed you.\nHold head high. Sumu responded with\ncomplete confidence. He always\nremembered the lyrics. Sleep, sleep,\nclose your eyes and don't hide. The soul\nis lost and cannot find relief. Sleep in\nthis night. Don't ask if it's real or\nnot. Until dawn breaks. the nightmare\nwill turn away. The meaning of this\nlyric is quite clear. You must keep your\neyes closed and not be deceived by\nillusions. Otherwise, your soul will be\nlost in darkness. As for when you can\nopen your eyes, you will naturally wait\nuntil dawn. When it comes to bewitching\npeople, Sumu is second to none. He could\nnever be fooled by a mere illusion.\nAfter being rejected, the henchman's\nbreathing became noticeably heavier, and\nhis tone turned icy. Leader, since\nyou've abandoned me, you won't live\neither. dot filled with resentment rang\nout and the underlings rushed madly\ntowards Sumu. Most people would have\nbeen startled and opened their eyes, but\nSumu didn't. He just calmly walked\nforward completely ignoring it. Sure\nenough, when the sound of his underlings\ncharging reached Su Mu&lt;unk&gt;s ears,\neverything came to an abrupt halt, and\nsilence returned once more. He continued\nwalking and gradually felt the warmth. A\nbeam of light pierced his tightly closed\neyes. It felt like facing the sun in\nbroad daylight with your eyes closed.\nEven with your eyes closed, you could\nstill feel the blinding light. Leader\nZiao Xiao Yao&lt;unk&gt;s overjoyed voice came\nfrom afar. Mr. Su, you're back.\nYion&lt;unk&gt;s voice also carried a hint of\nsurprise. Sumu, wake up. Why are your\neyes still closed? What happened to you\nafter you left with the shadowy figure?\nThe cacophony of voices filled Su&lt;unk&gt;s\nears, but he still didn't open his eyes.\nInstead, a mocking smile played on his\nlips. How clumsy. Can't you use your\nbrain before lying? Sumu was too lazy to\neven comment anymore. If a normal person\nsaw themselves return alive, their first\nreaction would definitely not be\nwelcome, but rather weariness and\nsuspicion since Wong Lee had become a\nmonster like the villagers. Moreover, it\nis known that the shadow only appears at\nnight or in the shadows. Now that the\nsunlight is so bright, how is it\npossible that the shadows hand is still\nholding his hand? The surrounding sounds\npaused and then Xiao Xia Yao and the\nothers tone turned icy cold. He\ndiscovered it. Kill him. Yes, kill him.\nA group of people charged at Sumu,\nletting out inhuman roars. Similarly,\nthese sounds subsided after they reached\nme. Sumu walked for a while longer, and\nthis time he heard some different\nsounds. The voices of children. Fool.\nHe. Here comes the silly Tinking. Hurry\nup. Hurry up. We don't play with idiots.\nA group of children were laughing and\nplaying when Ting Ting&lt;unk&gt;s agrieved\nvoice rang out amidst their mockery.\nTing Ting isn't stupid. He Look, this\nidiot is crying. Aren't you stupid? Your\nparents abandoned you because you're\nstupid. You're talking nonsense. Grandma\nsaid that mom and dad went to work in\nanother city. That's why they didn't\nabandon Tinking. Chapter 45. Truth is\nalways on my side. Sumu kept moving\nforward without stopping, and the\ninnocent voices of the children became\nmore and more mature, as if they had\ngrown up. This idiot is still playing in\nthe mud. She'll definitely play in the\nmud. After all, she's mentally\nchallenged. \"Hey, look, this idiot's got\nquite a big crown/girl. It really is.\nLet's go take a look, Tinking. Let's\nplay together.\" \"Really?\" Ting exclaimed\nin surprise. \"You guys are willing to\nplay with me?\" Sumu noticed that even\nTinking&lt;unk&gt;s voice had changed,\nbecoming more and more like the Tinking\nin the Silhouette of time. Of course, we\nare from the same village after all. How\nabout this, Tinking? Let's play a fun\ngame. Okay. Okay. What game? You'll find\nout when you play, but you absolutely\nmustn't tell your grandma or we won't\nplay with you anymore.\nW I don't want to play games. This game\nisn't fun. You're all bad people. You're\nbullying Tinking. Grab her quickly.\nDon't let her get away. You beasts. An\nold voice rang out, followed by the\nsound of a wooden stick hitting a person\nand screams of pain. Sumu recognized the\nvoice. It was Tinking&lt;unk&gt;s grandmother.\nTing Ting, remember when grandma goes to\nwork in the fields during the day? You\nstay at home, lock the door, and don't\nopen it for anyone. Grandma made your\nfavorite dumplings and put them in the\ncupboard. If you get hungry, just take\nthem out and eat them. Yes, Grandma.\nTinting remembers. Grandma, why do they\ncall Tinking an idiot? They are all bad\npeople. Tinking is not stupid. Ting is\nthe smartest child in the world. A\nsilvery laugh rang out. It was Tinking\ncheering excitedly. Ting is the smartest\nchild in the world. Tinking is the\nsmartest child in the world. Tinking,\nopen the door for your uncle. No.\nGrandma says uncle is a bad person. How\ncould your uncle be a bad person? Look,\nyour uncle even brought you your\nfavorite lollipop. Really? Of course\nit's true. Open the door quickly. Ah,\nyou're lying. You're a bad person. He\nTinking is getting more and more\nbeautiful. Hey, look. This idiot is\ntaking dumplings to the cemetery again.\nShe's really silly. Auntly saw that she\nhadn't eaten for several days and kindly\ngave her two steamed buns, but she\ndidn't want them. She insisted on\ndumplings and said that her grandmother\nloved dumplings the most. The village\nchief was kind enough to give her\ndumplings every few days, but she went\nand took dumplings to her grandmother's\ngrave everyday. I don't know who told\nher that her grandma was sleeping\nunderground and then she started going\ndoor to door asking for dumplings. I\nheard that as long as you give her\ndumplings, she'll be fine. Then the\nsound stopped abruptly. The hand holding\nthe shadowy figure had also disappeared\nwithout anyone noticing. Sumu opened his\neyes and saw a dark, dilapitated house.\nThe rocking chair inside was not\nrocking, and the sky outside was just\nbeginning to lighten. The little girl,\nTing, was standing quietly in front of\nhim, tilting her head and looking at him\nwith curiosity. Big Brother, were you\nsleeping standing up just now? Sumu\nsmiled gently and ruffled Tinking&lt;unk&gt;s\ndry, frizzy hair with his hand. Yes, Big\nBrother just fell asleep standing up.\nUpon hearing this, Tinting laughed\nhappily. Big brother, you're lying. No\none sleeps standing up. Sumu fainted\nsurprise. Tinting actually saw through\nit. Tinting is so smart. Tinting smiled\neven more happily, her big eyes curving\ninto crescent, revealing a row of small\nwhite teeth. Of course, Grandma says\nTinking is the smartest child in the\nworld. Yes, Tinking is the smartest\nchild in the world. Sumu nodded with a\nsmile. At this moment, Tinking seemed to\nhave thought of something and quickly\nran to the cupboard, opened it, and took\nout a plate of dumplings. Big Brother,\ndo you want to eat dumplings? They're so\ndelicious. Ting and grandma both love\ndumplings the most. Suddenly, the voices\nof Yi Fan Yu and others could be heard\noutside the house. Damn it, it gets\nlight so fast. Yang Doning complained.\nThis room is too small. If we stay here\nany longer, we'll only attract more\nshadowy figures. Listen to me. Let's\nfind another room. No way. Xiao Xiao Yao\nsaid firmly. What if the leader comes\nback and can't find us? You guys sigh?\nYion sighed. Do you really think Mr. Su\ncan come back? Even if he did come back,\nwould he still be the same person? As\nthey were talking, there was a crack.\nThe door to the thatched hut opened.\nEveryone stopped in their tracks and\nlooked solemnly at the gate. Then they\nsaw a man in a suit and tie carrying a\nsnakeskin cane and wearing brown glasses\nslowly walk out of the house. Leader\nZiao Xiao and the other Viper gang\nmembers were overjoyed. Don't go over\nthere. Ephanu stopped them, his eyes\nfixed on Sumu. Mr. Su, are you still\nyourself? Sumu smiled slightly. Of\ncourse, I told you the leader would be\nall right, Ziao Xiao exclaimed\nexcitedly, about to go find Sumu. But\nYionu stopped him. Wait, what evidence\ndo you have to prove it? Upon hearing\nthis, Su Mu&lt;unk&gt;s smile deepened, \"Mr.\nYei seems to have forgotten again.\" He\ngently pushed up his glasses, the smile\non his face slowly fading, and said\nindifferently, \"Have you forgotten who\nyou are? You want me to prove myself to\nyou? Are you worthy?\" Yianu&lt;unk&gt;s face\nsuddenly turned ashen as if he had eaten\n[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] while Xiao Xiao Yao and the others\nwalked behind Su Mu without hesitation.\nYong Dongqing hesitated for a moment,\nthen walked over as well. Mr. Yong, even\nyou, Yong Doning said without turning\nhis head. I just think the nightmare\nmonster shouldn't be able to imitate it\nso well. Yanu&lt;unk&gt;s expression grew\nincreasingly grim with only the anxious\nLe Chong beside him. Sumu said calmly,\n\"So, Mr. Ye, do you understand? Whether\nI am a nightmare or not is not\nimportant. What is important is that the\ntruth will always be on my side. You\ncall having a lot of people the truth.\nEphanu said darkly. Sumu smiled\nslightly. A large number of people is\nmerely a manifestation of power, and\npower is truth. After saying that, he\nled everyone into Tinkding&lt;unk&gt;s home.\nLi Chong hesitated for a moment and then\nfollowed him inside, leaving only Yi\nFonu with a gloomy expression. He stood\nthere for a long time before finally\nentering the house with a somber face.\nUpon entering the house, Eion's gaze was\nimmediately drawn to Ting, who was\nsitting at the table eating dumplings,\nor rather to the dumplings themselves.\nHe rushed over and snatched the plate of\ndumplings from Tinking&lt;unk&gt;s hands.\nGrandma gave it to me. Tinking pouted,\nabout to cry. Chapter 46. The method of\nreturning to reality. Ephanu didn't care\nabout any of that. Once he got the\ndumplings, they were his. Yong Donaing.\nSumu gave the order and Yong Doning, who\nwas already annoyed, immediately rushed\nforward to snatch it. Yanu was startled,\nnot expecting Yong Dona to make a move\nsuddenly, and hurriedly dodged backward.\nAt this moment, Tinking hurriedly waved\nher hand, her little face turning red\nwith anxiety. Don't fight. Tining\ndoesn't like fighting. If you want\ndumplings, you can have them. Yang\nDoning hesitated, but Eion snapped. Stop\nyour unnecessary sympathy. We're&lt;unk&gt;\nhuman. What about her? She's a creature\nfrom a nightmare. Maybe even a nightmare\nmonster. Don't fight. Tinting doesn't\nwant the dumplings anymore. Tinting\nbecame more and more anxious.\nKind-hearted, she didn't want to see\npeople quarrel. Did you hear that? She\nsaid she didn't want it anymore herself.\nEupanu said in a low voice, barely\nsuppressing his anger. Yong Donging\nfinally loosened his fists. He knew that\nsnatching it back would be useless and\nwould only make Tinking more unhappy.\nAfter the minor dispute subsided, Eanu\npicked up the dumplings and invited Li\nChong to come and eat. The eight\ndumplings from yesterday were\npractically nothing to someone who had\nbeen starving for 3 days. \"You eat\nfirst. I'll give you two this time,\"\nYionu said coldly. Lie Chong agreed in a\nmuffled voice. But when he went to get\nthe dumplings, he exclaimed softly. 11?\nOne less than yesterday. Eion looked\nclosely and found that there was indeed\none less than yesterday. He looked at\nTing and asked, \"Why is one missing? Did\nyou eat it or did you hide it? Tining\nshook her head. I didn't eat them and I\ndidn't hide them. Grandma made 11.\nEphanu gave her a deep look then said\nnothing more and continued eating\ndumplings with Li Chong. Yong Donging\nignored Ean Yu and the other person and\ninstead asked Sumu what happened after\nyou left. Sumu made no attempt to hide\nanything, stating, \"Frankly, just as I\nexpected, the shadow is not\ninsurmountable. As long as you close\nyour eyes, hold his hand, and keep\nwalking, you will return from the\ndarkness when dawn breaks. Yong Donging\nwas taken aback. It's that simple. It's\nsimple for me, but it might not be for\nyou. Yong Dong&lt;unk&gt;s face immediately\nfell. What do you mean? It's\nmeaningless. In the darkness, all sorts\nof sounds will tempt you to open your\neyes. Once you open your eyes, you will\nbe completely lost in the darkness and\neventually become a monster like the\nvillagers. Yong Doning curled his lip in\ndisdain. It's just closing your eyes.\nWhat's so difficult about that? Since I\nknow those voices are fake, I definitely\nwon't open my eyes. Yes, you're right. A\nflash of anger crossed Yong Doning&lt;unk&gt;s\nface. He felt he had been slighted, but\nhe had no evidence. Although Yion was\neating, he had already been listening\nintently. At this moment, Su Mu changed\nthe subject. I also obtained some\ninformation in the darkness. Information\nabout Tinking. He glanced at Tinking\nonly to find that the little girl had\nrun back into the bedroom to comb her\ndolls hair. He slowly recounted what he\nhad seen and heard in the darkness,\nmainly the sounds he heard from Tinking.\n5 minutes later, Yong Dong&lt;unk&gt;s face\nwas contorted with rage, his fists\nclenched so tightly that the veins on\nthem bulged. \"Beasts! These beasts! [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\nthem!\" At this moment, he felt his chest\nfilled with an unprecedented rage, and\neven his skin gleamed with a metallic\nsheen. He wanted to kill. He couldn't\nstop wanting to kill. In contrast to his\nanger, Eionu beside him was beaming with\njoy. That's great. What did you say?\nYang Donging glared angrily like a\nfurious lion. No, don't misunderstand.\nWhat I mean is, according to Mr.\nSu&lt;unk&gt;s description, Ting is very\nlikely the source of this nightmare. In\nother words, this is Ting&lt;unk&gt;s\nnightmare. Yu&lt;unk&gt;s gloomy expression\nvanished, replaced by excitement,\nbecause he had found a way to break free\nfrom this nightmare. A few minor\nsetbacks were nothing compared to being\nalive, he said excitedly, \"This is my\nthird time entering the nightmare world.\nI have some experience with nightmares.\nAlthough nightmares are bizarre, they\nare also traceable. For example, if\nsomeone watches a zombie movie before\ngoing to bed, there is a high\nprobability that they will dream of\nzombies that night. In other words,\ndreams are a reflection of reality. Mr.\nSue's explanation just now made me\nunderstand everything. It's because in\nreality, Ting is mostly bullied by\nvillagers during the day. In Tinking's\neyes, villagers are just villagers. They\nare out during the day and rest at\nnight. Think carefully about what\nTinking said when she went out to look\nfor her sister. It's not normal for her\nto call the villagers bad people instead\nof monsters. This is Ting&lt;unk&gt;s\nnightmare. So, the villager's actions\nall follow Tining's logic. Tining's\ngrandmother told her to hide at home,\nwhich is safe, so the villagers cannot\nenter the house. It is likely that this\nis also the case in reality. No matter\nhow much the villagers bully Tinking,\nthey would not dare to forcibly break\ndown doors and windows or force their\nway into a private residence. The\nvillagers could change their appearance\nand use various means to lure people\nout, which perfectly corresponds to\nsomeone using a lollipop to trick\nTinking into leaving her house. This\nmust have happened more than once. So,\nin Ting&lt;unk&gt;s eyes, the villagers would\nuse all sorts of sweet talk to trick her\ninto opening the door. Yionu became more\nand more excited as he spoke, but he\ndidn't noticed that Yong Dong&lt;unk&gt;s face\nwas getting even more gloomy. And\nanother thing, in the timeline, the\nvillage chief son was called Tinking the\nFool. I thought it was just a casual\nremark, but I never expected Tinking to\nactually be a fool. The reason she acts\nlike a little girl is because that's how\nbig her mind is. After all, a fool's\nintelligence is basically equivalent to\nthat of a child. Enough, Yong Donging\nshouted angrily. He couldn't tolerate Yi\nFan Yu calling Tinting an idiot. A\nkind-hearted girl with intellectual\ndisabilities, who did nothing wrong, was\ntreated this way. She loved dumplings,\nyet she chose to go hungry to give them\nto her deceased grandmother. Even now,\nwhen Yion tries to take her food, she's\nnot concerned about her own hunger, but\nrather about a potential fight. Yan\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s smile gradually cooled. Mr.\nYang, I understand your feelings. You\nsympathize with Ting&lt;unk&gt;s plight, but\ndon't forget this is the nightmare\nworld. The real Ting is long dead. The\ncurrent Ting is strictly speaking a\nnightmare monster. Yong Donging&lt;unk&gt;s\nchest heaved violently. He had nowhere\nto vent his anger. He knew Yionu was\nright, but he was still angry and\nfrustrated. Yianu turned his gaze to Su\nMu. Mr. Sue, I know you are rational and\nwith your wisdom, you must have already\nguessed all of this. So, the rest is\nvery simple. As long as we work together\nto eliminate the source of the\nnightmare, which is killing Tinking,\nthis nightmare will be broken. Chapter\n47. I refusal. Yion&lt;unk&gt;s voice suddenly\ndropped to a low hue. He glanced\ndiscreetly at the little girl combing\nthe hair of her doll in the bedroom and\ncontinued, \"Killing Ting shouldn't be\ndifficult. The only obstacle should be\nher deceased grandmother. When we take\naction against Tinking, we are very\nlikely to have a direct confrontation\nwith her grandmother, especially since\nnone of us can see her. We don't even\nknow if she's home right now. I guess\nshe probably isn't there since in\nTinking's memory, her grandmother had to\nwork in the fields during the day and\nwouldn't come back until dark. However,\njust to be on the safe side, I have a\nplan. It would be best if we didn't make\na move here, but instead lure Tinking\nout first. Among our group, Tinting\nshould trust you the most. Mr. Su, so\nperhaps you could. I disagree. Yang\nDonging suddenly erupted in anger. His\nfists clenched as he glared at Yanu.\nWhat did Tinking do wrong? She's just a\nvictim. There must be other ways.\nYianu&lt;unk&gt;s expression grew even colder.\nMr. Yang, I hope you can calm down.\nShe's not human. She's a nightmare\nmonster. Killing a nightmare monster can\nsave everyone's lives. Isn't that a good\nthing? As you said, besides killing the\nsource of the nightmare, there is indeed\nanother way to break free from the\nnightmare, which is to save the source\nof the nightmare. This nightmare started\nwith tinking. As long as all the\nvillagers are killed, without these evil\npeople, the nightmare will naturally not\nbe a nightmare. But do you think that's\npossible? With just a few of us facing\nhundreds of villagers, we have\nabsolutely no chance of winning.\nEspecially since you shouldn't forget,\nthere's no food here. Even superhumans\nwill starve to death without food, and\nthey'll grow weaker and weaker until you\ncan't even use your abilities anymore.\nHow will you kill the villagers then?\nYionu had clearly analyzed the pros and\ncons, but Yong Dong&lt;unk&gt;s answer\nremained the same. I disagree. This\nyoung man, who had just become a\nsuperhuman, showed unprecedented\ndetermination at this moment. He\nclenched his teeth. The veins on his\nface were faintly visible, and his eyes\nwere already filled with anger. I will\nkill all the villagers to avenge\nTinking. Yeanu was both shocked and\nfurious. Are you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] crazy? You'll\nkill everyone if you do this. How are we\nsupposed to deal with hundreds of\nvillagers? Revenge? What revenge are you\ntalking about? They're all dead now.\nIt's all a dream. Dream? Yong\nDongqing&lt;unk&gt;s eyes burned with an\nincomparably blazing and bright flame,\nand the metallic color on his body\nbecame even more intense. These scumbags\ndon't even deserve to live in dreams.\nWhy should they be able to bully Tinking\nin dreams for eternity after they die?\nTell me by what right? They damn it.\nYou're insane. You're really insane. Ye\nwas also furious. Mr. Su, I can't reason\nwith him. You're a smart man. As long as\nwe follow my plan, we can definitely\nreturn to reality. For a moment, Yong\nDonging and Yianu&lt;unk&gt;s eyes were both\nfocused on Sumu. Yionu knew that Su Mu\nwas a cold-blooded and intelligent\nperson and would definitely make the\nright choice. As for Yong Doning, he\nclenched his fists. He knew Su Mu&lt;unk&gt;s\ncold-bloodedness and ruthlessness, so he\nwas prepared to fight against both of\nthem at the same time. But deep down, he\nalso secretly hoped that Su would refuse\nYion&lt;unk&gt;s proposal. Facing their gazes,\nSumu smiled slightly. I refuse. Yong\nDonging was both surprised and delighted\nwhile Yion was completely stunned with\ndisbelief. You refuse? Yanu found it\nutterly unbelievable. Someone like you,\nwould you really care about the life or\ndeath of a nightmare monster? Sumu\nadjusted his brown tinted glasses,\nmaintaining his elegant smile. Mr. Yei\nseems to have a deep misunderstanding\nabout me. Actually, I've always been a\ngood person. Haha. Yonu laughed\nstrangely and menacingly. You a good\nperson? You are all good people, and I'm\nthe only bad one. He pointed at himself\nsomewhat frantically, never expecting\nthat he would end up in such a state\nwhen he was about to escape the\nnightmare. His joy had vanished\ncompletely. All I want is to live.\nWhat's wrong with that? Mr. Ye, you're\nbeing too attached to appearances. In\nthis world, there's no such thing as\nright or wrong, only strength and\nweakness. I understand your desire to\nlive, but please be sure to abide by my\ndecision. Sumu could not choose to kill\nTinking and return to reality. before he\nbecame a superhuman. Even if he returned\nnow, he would still die. At this moment,\nYion&lt;unk&gt;s expression turned completely\ncold. His eyes were filled with\nterrifying killing intent, and his right\nhand spread out five fingers with one\nblazing flame after another lighting up.\nYou're right. There's no right or wrong\nin this world, only strength and\nweakness. But who said I'm the weak one?\nAs soon as he finished speaking, the\natmosphere in the room froze instantly.\nYong Doning stepped forward and stood\nbeside Sumu while Xiao Xiao Yao and the\nothers drew their machetes, their\nfanatical faces filled with murderous\nintent. Sumu smiled faintly. Mr. Yei, if\nyou are really strong enough, then from\nthe moment you saw me, you should have\nunderstood that you had no chance of\nwinning from beginning to end. A mocking\nsmile appeared on Yeu&lt;unk&gt;s lips. It\nseems that my previous forbearance has\ncaused you to misunderstand me.\nPreviously, it was because there was no\nirreconcilable conflict between us. And\nsince we were both in the nightmare\nworld, it would be irrational to kill\neach other. So, I tolerated it in every\nway. But now, the key to breaking the\nnightmare has been found, and I have no\nmore worries. Moreover, I have already\nascertained your strengths. Yong\nDongqing is merely a newly promoted\nsuperhuman who is not yet proficient in\ncontrolling his own abilities. As for\nyou, you are nothing more than a group\nof ordinary people controlled by your\npuppet abilities. But your true self is\neven weaker than that of ordinary\npeople. Most importantly, your men have\nrun out of bullets in the previous\nbattles. Do you think you can still pose\nany threat to me? Sumu's expression\nremained unchanged. Who said, \"We've run\nout of bullets.\" Yianu&lt;unk&gt;s expression\nchanged slightly. His five fingers flame\nbullet mainly focuses on attack and\ncannot rely on his physical body to\ndefend against bullets like Yong Doning.\nIf the opponent still has a gun, then he\nis indeed in some danger. You don't need\nto bluff. I saw with my own eyes that we\nwere out of bullets. You're right. I've\nindeed run out of bullets, but Mr. Li\nChong doesn't. Upon hearing this, the\nfocus immediately shifted to Li Chong,\nwho had been hiding in a corner, not\ndaring to utter a sound. The tacatern\nmiddle-aged man slowly pulled a black\npistol from his waist, his hands still\ntrembling uncontrollably. Euani's heart\nsank. Although a gun posed no threat to\nhim, that was only true in a one-on-one\nsituation without Yong Donging and the\nothers. He was not afraid of a gun at\nall. Li Chong, don't you want to live?\nThe opportunity is right in front of\nyou. As long as you kill that little\ngirl, we can return to reality. The\nmiddle-aged man whose spine had been\nbroken by the burdens of life trembled\neven more. Chapter 48. I was just\nkidding. You idiot. I I want to live,\nMr. Sue. I have always been an honest\nand law-abiding person. I want to go\nback alive. I still have family,\nrelatives, and friends. I really can't\ndie here. Mr. Sue, I don't want to kill\nanyone. Please, please step aside. A big\nshot like you has the resources to seek\njustice for the monster. But I've\nalready exhausted all my strength just\nto survive, and my family is still\nwaiting for me in reality. Stop. Sumu\ninterrupted. Nobody likes to hear your\nSaab story. If you want, go join Eonu.\nIt won't make a difference if you're one\nmore person. At that moment, the\nmiddle-aged man's face suddenly turned\nred. He abruptly raised his gun and\naimed it at Sumu, then moved closer to\nYionu. I don't want to kill anyone.\nDon't force me. You either agreed to\nkill that monster or you die. No one\nexpected Li Chong to suddenly erupt at\nthis moment, and Yong Dongqing, Xiao,\nXiao Yao, and others quickly protected\nSu Mu behind them. Yion sneered. Mr. Su,\ndo you see? Not everyone is on your\nside. Oh, is that so? Sumu gently pushed\nup his brown glasses, and the eyes\nbehind the lenses emitted an invisible,\neerie light. Bang! The sudden gunshot\nstartled everyone. But what surprised\nthem even more was that the shot had hit\nEuanu. Yifu, as expected of a superhuman\nwho has experienced three nightmare\nworlds, actually gave a warning when\nfaced with a cold shot from behind and\ntwisted his body to deflect the bullet\nthat should have hit him. However, even\nso, he was still shot, and a bloody hole\nappeared on his right back, from which\nblood gushed out. Yiu groaned and\nsuddenly retreated, putting distance\nbetween himself and the others. His face\nwas now covered in pain and anger. Li\nChong, Yu, No, it's not my fault. My\nhand is out of control.\" Li Chong\npanicked completely, his body trembling\nviolently, his dark face filled with\nfear as if he had encountered something\nunpredictable. Bang! Bang! Bang! Several\ngunshots rang out and deadly bullets\nwhistled towards Yionu. But he was after\nall a superhuman. With the distance\ncreated, the astonishing physical\nabilities of a superhuman became\napparent. Facing the bullets fired by Li\nChong, he was like a nimble snake\nsuddenly flipping over and smashing\nthrough the window to escape from the\nhouse. Brother Yi, I really didn't mean\nto. My hand just wouldn't cooperate.\nHuh? A burst of wild laughter suddenly\nerupted from Li Chong&lt;unk&gt;s mouth as he\nchased after the gun while firing. I was\nlying to you. You idiot. How dare you\ndisobey the leader. You deserve to die.\nYou bunch of lunatics. You all deserve\nto die. Outside the house, Yion, who was\ndesperately trying to escape, was\ncompletely blinded by rage. Bang! A\nfiery projectile shot from his\nfingertip, leaving a trail of blazing\nflames in the air before striking Lie\nChong hard in the body. In an instant,\nLi Chong&lt;unk&gt;s maniacal laughter ceased\nabruptly. He was consumed by the flames.\nAt this moment, several villagers who\nhad been waiting outside the house\nroared and charged towards Ephanu.\nEnraged, he attacked in succession,\nfiring several fireballs that instantly\nkilled the villagers. Ephanu stared\nintently at the dilapitated thatched\nhut. He knew he had to deal with the\nvillagers before they arrived. So he\nsuddenly spread his arms wide, aimed at\nthe hut, and said in an extremely cold\nvoice, \"Tinfinger flame bullet.\" His 10\nfingertips lit up with blazing flames\none after another, which quickly twisted\nand converged, transforming into 10\ncompressed fireballs. Boom! 10 fireballs\nroared out, leaving 10 trails of flame\nin the air. They swirled and\nintertwined, eventually merging into a\nsingle fireball the size of a fist,\nwhich struck the thatched hut hard. The\nfireballs collided violently with the\nthatched hut, sparks flying everywhere\nin an instant. The hut was like a giant\nbonfire being lit. The flames\nmercilessly devouring every piece of\nwood. The crimson flames shot straight\ninto the sky and thick smoke rose up,\nforming a huge black column that\nobscured the sky. Previously, Eionu had\nconcealed his strength, always using the\nfive fingers flame bullet to deal with\nthe villagers attacks. But this time,\nfacing Sum Mu and the others, he used\nhis full power. Is he dead? Yonu gasped\nfor breath. The pain from the gunshot\nwound in his back, continuing to\nirritate his nerves. Just when he\nthought everyone was dead, he discovered\nthat behind the raging flames, several\nfigures dressed in black suits were\nfaintly visible. They emerged safely\nfrom the side of the flames, converging\nlike a small black torrent. The leader\nwas Su Mu and beside him, Yong Donging\nwas holding Tinking, who looked\nterrified. Yion&lt;unk&gt;s face darkened. He\nrealized that Su Mu and the others must\nhave escaped through the back window\nbeforehand. He didn't need to think to\nknow who came up with the idea. It must\nhave been Su Mu. Only Su Mu had the\nbrains to guess in advance that he was\ngoing to burn down the house. Yang\nDoning put Tinking down, a gentle look\nappearing on his steelely face. Ting\nTing, be good. Stay away, brother. go\nand deal with this bad guy first.\nAlthough Tinting&lt;unk&gt;s intelligence was\nstill at a young age, she was not\nincapable of distinguishing between good\nand evil. She nodded obediently, then\njumped down from Yong Donging&lt;unk&gt;s arms\nand ran away with her short legs. Yong\nDoning was not worried about Tinking\nsafety. She was the source of the\nnightmares and had lived here for an\nunknown amount of time. Nothing in the\nnightmares could easily harm her. Then,\nYong Doning stared intently at Yuan Yu\nwith his tiger-like eyes. Neither of\nthem spoke, but both could see the\ndetermination in the others eyes. The\ntwo had different ideologies, and\nneither could persuade the other. The\nonly option was to fight. The atmosphere\nin the arena instantly became tense.\nYang Donging stood there like an iron\nfortress, his body gleaming with\nmetallic luster. Yiong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\nfingertips flickered with fire, and the\nair around him rose and twisted,\nradiating terrifying high temperatures.\nSuddenly, Yong Doning moved. He pounced\nout like a swift cheetah. He knew very\nwell that his only chance to defeat\nYionu was to get close to him. Yionu\nnaturally knew this as well. So the\ninstant Yong Doning charged at him, he\nformed his hands into a gun shape and\nfired. Bang! Bang! Bang! He fired\ncontinuously with both hands while his\nbody moved rapidly in response, widening\nthe distance between them. Several fire\nbullets whistled out as if the\nsurrounding air had been ignited. Yong\nDoning, who was speeding along, rushed\ntowards the flames, intending to\nwithstand the flames head on and not\ngive Yuan Yu any time to move. Boom,\nboom, boom. Fireballs rained down on\nYong Dongqing, making him stagger and\nleaving faint traces of char on his\nbody, but he still didn't stop and\ncharged towards Ephanu. Because of Ting,\nhis body, which was in a state of\nintense rage, was noticeably stronger.\n10finger flame bullets. Yionu&lt;unk&gt;s eyes\nturned cold and he fired 10 flame\nbullets at once. The terrifying flame\nbullets intertwined and merged in the\nair, turning into a large flame bullet\nthat slammed into Yong Doning&lt;unk&gt;s\nbody. Chapter 49. My ability is stand\nuser. Boom. The power of this attack was\nterrifying. The explosive flames\nexploded directly on Yong Dongqing&lt;unk&gt;s\nbody, instantly turning into a raging\nsea of fire that engulfed his figure.\nHuh? With a roar of anger mixed with\npain. Yong Donaing, his body charred,\nforced a gash through the sea of fire\nand rushed out. The little bit of hair\nthat had just grown out was now gone. He\nleaped up suddenly, pouncing on Yion\nlike a tiger descending a mountain. Yanu\nwas startled and quickly dodged.\nFollowing closely behind was Yong\nDonging reign of punches. The metallic\nfists made the air explode with each\nstrike, but Eion was obviously faster.\nHe took a step back and dodged the\npunch. He was experienced in combat\nafter all. Taking advantage of the gap\nin Yong Dona&lt;unk&gt;s attack, he seized the\nopportunity and fired a fireball at Yong\nDoning&lt;unk&gt;s face. Yong Doning was\nshocked and quickly used his hands to\nblock. Little did they know this was\nexactly what Eionu wanted. Ultimately,\nthey were still too inexperienced. Yiong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s face contorted with rage, and\nhis right hand shot out suddenly, his\nfive fingers forming a claw. Swish. A\nseries of sparks ignited at his\nfingertips, transforming into five\nhighly compressed fireballs. However,\nthis time he did not fire the fireballs.\nInstead, he clenched his five fingers\ntightly. What happens when he holds five\nhighly compressed flame bullets in his\nhand? The next moment, Ephanu gave his\nanswer. His entire fist seemed to be set\nablaze, burning fiercely. The flames\nwere no longer a bright orange yellow,\nbut were mixed with a touch of fiery red\nflame fist. He threw a punch which\nlanded squarely on Yong Dona&lt;unk&gt;s\nexposed abdomen. Boom. A deafening\nexplosion rang out and terrifying flames\nengulfed the two people almost\ninstantly. Oh. A scream rang out and a\ncharred figure was sent flying backward\nlike a cannonball. His body arked\nthrough the air before crashing into a\nrow of thick trees. With a series of\ncracking sounds, several trees fell and\nleaves flew everywhere. He crashed\nheavily to the ground. The powerful\nimpact carving a deep furrow in the\nearth, sending dust and gravel flying\neverywhere. The person who flew\nbackwards was Yong Doning. He thought\nEanu wasn't good at close combat, but\nlittle did he know that Eion had a trump\ncard up his sleeve, and it was all just\nan illusion. At this moment, Yong\nDoning&lt;unk&gt;s abdomen was charred and\neven emitted a pungent smell of burnt\nroasted meat. His consciousness began to\nblur, his eyes rolled back, and he\nstruggled to get up, but collapsed\nheavily to the ground. He stared blankly\nat the sky, only then realizing that he\nhad always been weak, even after\nbecoming a superhuman. Am I going to\ndie? He himself had fallen, and he\ndidn't believe that Su Mu could defeat\nEphanu. Perhaps this was where they\nwould all perish. But why am I so\nunwilling to accept this? I haven't\navenged Tinking yet, and Jasmine is\nstill waiting for me to come back. I\ncan't die yet. A strong will cause the\nsurge of power to rise within him once\nmore. With this power, he struggled to\nhis feet, his eyes brimming with\nfighting spirit. He can't fall down yet.\nBoom! A flaming bullet streaked through\nthe air and landed precisely on Yong\nDoning. Bang! Yong Doning&lt;unk&gt;s eyes\nrolled back completely and he fell\nasleep immediately. He eventually\ncollapsed. Yion didn't give him a chance\nto stand up at all. At this moment, the\nflames around Yion had dissipated. He\nwas in very bad condition. His face was\npale. His chest was heaving violently,\nand there were even burn marks on his\nbody, especially his right hand, which\nwas charred and hanging limply. Sumu,\nwho had been watching the battle,\nnarrowed his eyes slightly. The five\nfingers flame bullet provided Yi Fanu\nwith a high level of fire resistance,\notherwise he would not be able to\ncontrol the flames. However, this fire\nresistance was also limited. The flame\nfist just now could be said to have hurt\nboth the attacker and himself. The five\ncompressed fireballs exploded at close\nrange, first injuring Yion&lt;unk&gt;s hand\nand then Yong Daunching. However, Yionu\nblocked most of the damage thanks to his\nfire resistance. Although Yionu was in a\nsorry state with one hand crippled, he\nwore a smug grin that suggested he had\nthe upper hand. He walked towards Su Mu\nstep by step. Mr. Su, you're the only\none left. Xiao Xiao Yao and the others\ntinced up and immediately grabbed their\nmachetes to block Su Mu&lt;unk&gt;s way.\nYeu&lt;unk&gt;s smile grew even more sinister.\nYou think you can stop me with just a\nfew ordinary people? Har, weren't you\nalways so arrogant? I'm quite curious to\nsee what kind of ugly behavior someone\nlike you will show before he dies. Faced\nwith Eon&lt;unk&gt;s maniacal laughter, Sumu\nalso smiled. He waved his hand,\nsignaling Xiao Xiao Yao and the others\nto disperse. Ziao Xiao Yao and the\nothers who were obedient to orders\nnaturally dispersed, revealing Su Mu,\nwho had been protected all along. Yionu\npaused, his face showing weariness. Mr.\nSu. In the face of absolute strength,\nany tricks you play are useless. Upon\nhearing this, Sumu smiled faintly, his\nslender, fair fingers gently removing\nthe brown glasses from his face, folding\nthem slowly and deliberately, and then\nputting them into his pocket. That\nconfidence in controlling everything\nmade Yonu even more vigilant, and he\ndared not let his guard down in the\nslightest. At this moment, Sumu smiled\nand said, \"Mr. Yei, do you really think\nmy abilities are those of a puppet?\" Yi\nFanu&lt;unk&gt;s heart skipped a beat. \"What\ndo you mean? How could your ability not\nbe a puppet? If you're not a puppet, how\ncould you bring so many subordinates\ninto the nightmare world?\" Sumu gently\nshook his head. \"My ability is stand\nuser, a substitute. I don't care what\nyour ability is, just die.\" Yionifu\nsuddenly launched an attack and a\nblazing fireball shot out, hitting\nSumu&lt;unk&gt;s body squarely. Boom! Sumu\ndied. His body reduced to a charred\ncorpse. Playing tricks. Yanu sneered.\nMr. Yei, be careful. Sumu&lt;unk&gt;s voice\nsuddenly rang out from behind Eionu.\nEionu was startled and turned around to\nsee Sumu rushing towards him at high\nspeed. The speed he displayed in that\ninstant was not like that of a weak\nperson. He was even faster than an\nordinary person. How is this possible? I\ndon't believe it. Yonu roared in shock\nand anger. Five-finger flame bullet.\nBang! A blazing fireball ripped through\nthe air and landed precisely on Sumu,\ncausing him to burst into flames.\nHowever, the next moment, Sumu rushed\nout of the flames. Although most of his\nbody was charred, he still kept moving\ntowards Ephanu. Yifanu was increasingly\nshocked. How could someone with an iron\nbody withstand his fireball? And if he\nhad just killed Sumu, then who was this\nperson in front of him? An overwhelming\nsense of unease gripped his mind, and he\nfired again. Bang! Bang! Two more\nfireballs were fired, finally killing\nSumu completely. Another charred corpse\nfell to the ground. However, Eionu did\nnot relax at all. He looked around\nnervously, and sure enough, the thing he\nfeared most happened. \"Chapter 50. Kill\nme, then become me. Sumo! Sumu is\neverywhere.\" At this moment, he felt\nutterly absurd. He was actually\nsurrounded by a group of sumu. No, this\nis impossible. What on earth is going\non? Eiona was completely panicked. He\nhad never seen such a bizarre scene\nbefore. He fired like a mad man. The\nfireballs spraying out in all directions\nlike a stream of water. In an instant,\nthe entire battlefield was engulfed in\nflames. In that sea of fire, the Sumu,\ntheir bodies twisted and their skin\ncharred black by the flames, still\ncharged towards him fearlessly. Sumu,\nYeonu roared to the sky, his eyes\nalready bloodshot. I don't care what\nkind of weird abilities you have. As\nmany as you come, I'll kill them all. He\nwent completely mad, his emotions\nseemingly ignited, and he charged madly\nat Su Mu in all directions, killing\nanyone he saw. Kill me, kill me, and\nthen become me. The voices of Sumu, who\nlooked exactly the same, rang out\nsimultaneously from all around. Huh?\nDie. All of you die. 10-finger flame\nbullet. Flame fist. Explosions, flames,\nand the thud of corpses falling filled\nthe air, weaving a symphony across the\nfiery battlefield. 5 minutes later, only\none figure remained standing on the\nentire battlefield, swaying and panting\nheavily, nearly exhausted. It was\nEphonu. He bent over, his hands\nsupporting his knees, breathing in the\nscorching air, his eyes even glistening\nwith snowflakes. But he was laughing, a\nhysterical laugh that seemed to be a\nform of catharsis, looking around at\nSumu's corpse. Huh, I won. In the end, I\nstill won. Cough, cough, cough. He was\ncoughing violently, and his back was\nhurting so much that he could barely\nstraighten up. It took him a while to\ncalm down. Just as he was about to get\nup, he froze as if someone had cast a\nspell on him, and he stood there\nmotionless. His expression was one of\nutter horror, as if he had seen\nsomething terrifying, his pupils almost\nshrinking to pinpoints. What he saw was\na small puddle on the ground, a puddle\nleft over from the previous rain. It\ncontained some rain water, which mixed\nwith the soil and made it look very\nmurky. But in that murky puddle, a face\nwas reflected. A face that terrified\nYonu to the extreme. Sumu's face. That\npale, handsome face was still smiling,\npolite and elegant. The next moment,\nYionu trembled as he touched his face,\nhis expression almost crazed. Sumu, who\nwas in the puddle, touched his face,\nmaking the same gesture as Ephanu. No,\nno, no, no. This isn't real. Yanu\nfrantically tore at his face as if\ntrying to rip the skin off. He suddenly\nremembered Sumu&lt;unk&gt;s words. Kill me and\nthen, become me. I'm Sumu. Yanu broke\ndown. No, that's not right. I'm Eu.\nSumu, get out here. I'm going to kill\nyou. I've always been here. Sumu&lt;unk&gt;s\ngentle voice rang in Yianu&lt;unk&gt;s ears. I\nI am you. You're going to kill me,\naren't you? Go ahead and do it. Yanu\nbecame increasingly distraught. You\ncan't fool me. Get out here. In the\npuddle, Sumu&lt;unk&gt;s face smiled silently.\nI said before, my ability is a stand\nuser. From now on, I will live in your\nplace. Your power, your wealth, even\nyour family, friends, wife, will all\nbelong to me. Don't even think about it.\nYeonu roared madly, his eyes bloodshot.\nI'd rather die than let you succeed. You\nwant to live in my place? Huh? Then\nwe&lt;unk&gt;ll die together. He suddenly\nraised his right hand, which was\nclenched into the shape of a gun, and\nthen shoved his index finger into his\nmouth with his eyes bloodshot and\nflashing with madness. Ephanu did not\nhesitate at all and chose to fire.\nFive-finger flame bullet. He fired the\nlast five fingers flame bullet of his\nlife. And the target of that fireball\nwas himself. Bang. Yanu fell to the\nground with a thud. See, he committed\nsuicide. It has nothing to do with me.\nDeep in the woods, Sumu shrugged\nhelplessly while Yong Doning beside him\nwas already dumbfounded. As a spectator\nof this battle, he was arguably the most\nqualified to speak on the matter, having\nnever witnessed such a bizarre fight.\nAfter being knocked unconscious by\nEphanu, he suddenly felt the sharp pain\nin his lower body while he was\nunconscious. And then he woke up. When\nhe woke up, he found that Sumu was\nhitting him with a snake patterned\nwooden cane. Just as he was about to\nunleash a torrent of curses, Sumu\nshushed him and pointed at Yionu. He\nlooked at Yanu and saw that the man was\nslaughtering villagers like a mad man,\nshouting Sumu&lt;unk&gt;s name as he did so.\nFinally, he shot himself in the head.\nWhat's going on? Yong Donging didn't\nunderstand at all, but he did understand\nwhy Su Mu had woken him up. The\nvillagers had appeared and were\nattacking not only Ephanu, but also Su\nMu and the others. After waking up, Yong\nDonging, Xiao, Xiao, Yao, and others\nwork together to kill a group of\nvillagers at the cost of heavy\ncasualties on their own side. Let's go.\nIf we stay here, we'll just get attacked\nby the villagers again. Let's&lt;unk&gt; go\nfind Ting, Sumu said calmly. Severely\ninjured, Yong Dongqing dragged his\nbroken body, following closely behind\nSumu. He looked at his own charred body\nand then at Xiao Xiao Yao and the others\ncovered in blood, feeling utterly\nabsurd. Of the Viper gang members who\nhad followed Sumu earlier, only five\nremained. One of them was Xiao Xiao, and\nthe names of the other four were\nunknown. All of them were seriously\ninjured. Only Sumu, in his impeccably\ndressed and elegant demeanor, looked as\nif he were going to a banquet. This made\nYong Donging wonder if he and the others\nwere really experiencing the same\nnightmare as Sumu in a low-rise\nresidential house. Sumu and his group\nsettled down temporarily with a dense\ncrowd of villagers outside the house. I\nnever expected someone like you to\nchoose to help. Tinting, Yong, Doning\nstared at Sumu as if trying to see\nthrough him to understand what kind of\nperson he really was. Sumu smiled\nslightly. What kind of person do you\nthink I am? You're a mad man, a\ngentleman who doesn't care about human\nlife at all and keeps talking about\nwitnessing something amazing. Yong\nDoning gave his objective assessment.\nThank you for the compliment. Yong\nDoning retorted angrily, \"I'm not\npraising you. I just don't understand\nwhy someone like you would help.\"\nThinking Sumu pushed up his glasses, his\ndark, unfathomable eyes fixed on him,\nand said calmly, \"Young Doning, what do\nyou think I mean by wonderful?\" Yong\nDongqing snorted coldly, recalling his\nprevious encounter with Jasmine. You\nlike to manipulate human nature and\nwatch people struggle to satisfy your\nperverse tastes. Isn't that the kind of\nexcitement you crave? Chapter 51. The\nworld shouldn't be like this. Sumu\nslowly shook his head. You're wrong. The\nstruggle of humanity is certainly\nwonderful. But isn't the indomitable\nresistance against fate, the selfless\ndedication to ideals, the unwavering\ndevotion to love, and even the genuine\nfeelings revealed in the simplest and\nmost ordinary life also wonderful. These\nare the elements that make up a person's\nwonderful life. Yong Dongqing was\nsomewhat lost in thought, wondering why\nhe could hear such fervent sincerity in\nSu Mu&lt;unk&gt;s calm voice. He remained\nsilent for a long time as if he were\nseeing Sumu for the first time. You're\nright. Yong Doning said earnestly. He\nbelieved it. He believed it. He actually\nbelieved it. Har. Sumu laughed happily\nat Xiao Xiao beside him like a child who\nhad successfully pulled off a prank. You\nson of a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Yong Donging instantly\nlost his composure. If he hadn't been\nseriously injured, he would have jumped\nup right now and smashed Sumu&lt;unk&gt;s head\nin. Yong Donging, your expression right\nnow is just as interesting, huh? Yong\nDonging&lt;unk&gt;s face was as black as coal.\nHe was so angry that he turned his head\naway and ignored Su. Chief, what should\nwe do next? Should we kill all these\nvillagers? Ziao Xiao asked worriedly. He\nwasn't worried about his own life, but\nabout Sumu&lt;unk&gt;s safety. In his current\nstate, it's very difficult for him to\nprotect the leader. Sumu shook his head.\nIf I'm not mistaken, even if we kill all\nthese villagers, the nightmare won't be\nover. What? Ziao Xiao was shocked. And\neven Yong Doning, who had turned his\nhead away, turned back. Didn't Yanu say\nbefore that there are two ways to break\nfree from nightmares? One is to kill the\nsource of the nightmare, and the other\nis to save the source of the nightmare.\nIf we kill all the villagers, wouldn't\nthat be the same as saving Tinking? Yang\nDonging couldn't care less about being\nstubborn anymore and said in a hurried\ntone. He knew Jasmine was waiting for\nhim and he didn't want to die here. Sumu\nstared at him and said slowly, \"Do you\nreally think that killing the villagers\nwill save Tinting? She is the source of\nthe nightmare. Everything here is\nbecause of her. In other words, those\nvillagers can't actually hurt her at\nall. What trapped her was never the\nvillagers, but her own obsession. Her\nown obsession. A look of doubt appeared\non Yong Doning&lt;unk&gt;s face. Isn't her\nnightmare these villagers who have been\nbullying her? As long as these villagers\nare killed, how could the nightmare not\nbe broken? Sumu recalled the innocent\nlittle girl, and a gentle smile appeared\non his lips. A little girl who didn't\nwant you to have a conflict with Ephanu,\nand who would rather go hungry than eat\nher favorite dumplings. Was revenge\nreally her obsession? Perhaps she never\nharbored hatred. She was just an\ninnocent little girl, a little girl\nlonging to find her family. Do you\nremember that photo? Even when Tinking\nhid, she would still hold on to the\nphotos. So in Ting&lt;unk&gt;s heart, what\nmattered was never hatred, but family.\nYong Donging was suddenly jolted, and an\nindescribable emotion welled up in his\nheart. For some reason, he felt a deep\nbitterness in his heart, and that\nbitterness climbed up his heart to his\neyes. He remained silent for a long\ntime, and when he spoke again, he found\nhis voice was already. This world\nshouldn't be like this. Sumu gave him a\ndeep look, her calm words chillingly\ncold. Perhaps this is just how the world\nis. Then I will change the world. Yong\nDonging suddenly clenched his fists,\nveins bulging on his face. Sumu&lt;unk&gt;s\ntone remained calm. Do you know many\nyoung people's initial dream is to\nchange the world, but in the end they\nare all changed by the world. I'm\ndifferent from them. Yang Doning roared\nas if making a vow or as if reaffirming\nhis belief. Since God has bestowed this\npower upon me, I will use it to change\nthis damn world. Yang Doning, have you\never thought that you might not be able\nto change anything? Behind every\nnightmare, there might be a tinting. You\ncan't even save Tinting now. So, how can\nyou talk about the future? Right now,\nyou're blinded by enthusiasm. But what\nabout a few days later when you're\nstarving and dying of thirst? Will you\nagree with Yion&lt;unk&gt;s idea? Impossible.\nI, Yong, Doning, would rather die than\ndo anything to harm Tinting. She's\nalready pitiful enough. She doesn't\ndeserve to be treated like this. Yong\nDonging said, his eyes bloodshot. Sumu\nelegantly pushed up his glasses. Really?\nWhat about Jasmine? You'd rather die\nhere than go back to see Jasmine one\nlast time. Jasmine loves you so much.\nShe even drew her sword against me for\nyou. If you die, what will happen to\nJasmine? These words were like a sharp\nknife, piercing Yong Donging&lt;unk&gt;s heart\nand turning his face instantly pale.\nJasmine, wake up. Yong Doning, this is\nthe cruelty of reality. Yong Doning\nsuddenly looked up and said firmly, \"I\nwill help Tinking find her family and\nthen return to the real world.\" Sumu\nsmiled and said, \"Young Doning, you are\nsurprisingly greedy. You want to have\nyour cake and eat it too, but that's not\nsomething you can do just by talking.\nFor example, you still don't even know\nwho the younger sister Ting has been\nlooking for is.\" Yong Dongqing was\nstunned, and an indescribable sense of\nfrustration welled up inside him. He\nhated his own incompetence, but the next\nsecond, as if he had thought of\nsomething, he grinned. I really don't\nknow anything, but I still believe I\ncan. Oh, Sumu asked with slight\ncuriosity. Who gave you that confidence?\nYong Donging stared intently at Sumu and\nsaid firmly, \"You?\" Sumu was taken\naback, then pointed to himself, \"Me?\"\nYong Doning grinned. Even though the\npain from his wound made him wse, he\nstill smiled. \"That's right. It's&lt;unk&gt;\nyou who gave me confidence. a dangerous\nguy like you could kill yanu without\nhesitation which means you must have a\nway to help Tinking. Sumu stared at Yong\nDonqing as if you were getting to know\nhim all over again. Yong Doning did not\nlook away and his determined eyes met\nSumu Mu&lt;unk&gt;s gaze directly. Suddenly,\nSumu smiled silently. Yong Doning, I'm\nreally impressed with you. Yes, I do\nhave a way, but I'm not sure if it will\nwork. You need to understand that if we\nfail, we might all die. I don't care.\nSumu's smile widened. What a\ncoincidence. Me, too. Chapter 52. The\ntrue meaning of illusion. Very good.\nSumu leaned on his snakeskin cane and\nstood up from his chair. This elegant\nnobleman issued his first command.\nFirst, find Tinking. Wait a minute. You\nstill haven't told me who Tinking sister\nis. Yong Doning asked curiously, as he\nwas indeed very curious about the sister\nwho didn't exist in the photo. Sumu\nglanced at him. Are you sure you want to\nknow? Of course. Yong Dongqing was a\nlittle puzzled, wondering why Sumu would\nask such a question. Since that's the\ncase, then I'll tell you my speculation.\nSumu paused, then continued. First of\nall, you need to understand one thing.\nThe real Tinting isn't this age. She's\nnot a little girl, but a young woman.\nYong Doning nodded. I know that the\nreason Tinting looks like a little girl\nis because her mindset is still that of\na child. So, who do you think is the\nyounger sister that the girl who is\noften bullied is talking about? the one\nwho doesn't appear in the family photo.\nHow would I know about my sister? Yong\nDonging was stunned. The next moment,\nhis face turned extremely ugly. A\nboiling killing intent almost surged\nthrough his entire body, causing his\nheavily injured body to tremble\nuncontrollably. He clenched his teeth so\ntightly they almost broke, veins bulging\non his face, making him look like a\nferocious demon. In that instant, he\nunderstood everything. There was no\nyounger sister in the family photo, no\nyounger sister in Tinking's life story\nin the shadows, and even only traces of\nlife between the two people in\nTinkding's home. Her grandmother always\nleft only a plate of dumplings. It seems\nyou figured it out. Tining may never\nhave had any brothers or sisters. The\nreason she's called little sister is\nbecause she doesn't have those concepts.\nEnough. Stop talking. Yong Donging\nroared angrily. Damn it. Damn it. H.\nYong Dona smashed the tables and chairs\nin the room in a fit of rage until the\nroom was a complete mess before he\nstopped. As a result, his wounds\nreopened and bright red blood soaked his\nclothes. However, the next moment, a\nmetallic luster emerged from his body.\nUnder the illumination of the metallic\nluster, his injuries continued to heal,\nand even the surface of his skin\nappeared golden. A glint of light\nflashed in Sumu's eyes. Is this the iron\nwill? He had previously confirmed that\nemotional willpower could enhance a body\nof steel. But he never expected that\nwhen Yong Donging was in an extreme\nemotional state, this enhancement could\nreach such a level. He even suspected\nthat if superhumans had levels, Yong\nDong&lt;unk&gt;s level might have been one\nbefore, but now it had become two. It is\nobvious that Yiu became a superhuman\nearlier and his combat power is\nsignificantly stronger than Yong\nDonging, which shows that their\nabilities still have the potential for\nfurther development. Your abilities have\nimproved,\" Sumu asked. Yaong\nDonqing&lt;unk&gt;s chest heaved violently,\nand after a long while, he finally let\nout a heavy hum. \"Great, then we are\nmore confident now. Let me briefly\nexplain my plan. It's&lt;unk&gt; actually very\nsimple,\" hypnotized Tinking. Yong\nDonging suddenly turned his head,\nclearly sensitive to the word hypnosis.\nignoring his ferocious expression, Sumu\ncontinued, \"It's impossible to find\nTing&lt;unk&gt;s family because they're\nalready dead. Even Tinting herself only\nexists in nightmares. Besides, even if\nwe found them, it wouldn't be a happy\nending since Tining&lt;unk&gt;s parents\ndeliberately abandoned her. Therefore,\nthe only solution is hypnosis. Through\nhypnosis, Tinking will experience\nhallucinations, leading to a family\nreunion. What kind of method is this?\nYang Daing roared. Even if it works,\nwhat's the point? It's&lt;unk&gt; all fake.\nAll an illusion. Sumu pushed up his\nbrown glasses, hiding his gaze behind\nthem, and calmly said, \"You're wrong.\nThis is the true meaning of illusion.\nPeople you can't see in reality, you can\nsee in illusions. What you can't do in\nreality, you can do in illusion. Do you\nremember the last line of the lullabi?\nSleep soundly through the night. Don't\nask whether it's real or unreal until\ndawn breaks and the nightmare will turn\naway.\" Yong Donging fell silent. His\nmind was in turmoil so much so that his\nbrain was unable to think. Do you think\nthe nightmare before you is real or\nfake? Since the boundary between dreams\nand reality has been broken, it means\nthat reality is also fake and fake is\nalso real. Since Tinking can manifest\nsuch a nightmare, why can't I use\nillusion magic to construct the\nbeautiful dream in her heart and then\nlet her get rid of the nightmare and\nmanifest a beautiful dream? Can it\nreally be done? Yong Doning asked\nhorsely. Sumu nodded. Theoretically,\nit's absolutely possible. First of all,\nTing Ting is the source of the\nnightmare, which means that everything\nis caused by her. As long as her mindset\nis changed, the nightmare will naturally\nchange as well. However, there is one\ntroublesome thing. I suspect that the\nrules of nightmares will change during\nthe hypnosis of tainting because\nhypnosis is equivalent to modifying her\ncognition, and nightmares are based on\nher cognition. And the villagers will\ndefinitely stop me. After all, they live\non nightmares. And changing their dreams\nis tantamount to killing them\ncompletely. So leave it to me. Yong\nDonging roared, his metallic gleam\nshining even brighter. These damn\nbeasts. Even if they're just living in a\ndream, I won't allow it. Very well. Then\nlet's&lt;unk&gt; wait for nightfall. With\nthat, Sumu plopped back down on the\nstool. Yang Doning, who was full of\nvigor, paused. Aren't we looking for\nTinking? Let's go. Sumu shook his head.\nThis is Ting&lt;unk&gt;s nightmare. If she\ndoesn't want to come out, no one can\nfind her. She won't come out during the\nday. After all, she has to avoid the\nvillagers. If Ting&lt;unk&gt;s house hadn't\nbeen destroyed, we could go there to\nlook for her. But now, we can only wait.\nThen I'll go out and kill a few\nvillagers first. Yong Donging couldn't\nhold back any longer and was about to\nset off immediately. Wait a minute. A\nsnakeskin came blocked his way. What you\nneed to do now is conserve your energy.\nThere will be a big battle tonight. But\ncan you guarantee you'll be able to find\nTinking tonight? Sumu smiled\nmysteriously. Of course, but I need to\nget some sleep before that. After saying\nthat, Sumu leaned back in his chair and\nfell asleep under Yong Dong&lt;unk&gt;s\nsurprised gaze. His hands were folded\nover his abdomen, and his posture\nremained upright. Even in his sleep, he\nstill gave people a refined and elegant\nfeeling. Sumu fell asleep not because he\nwas tired, but because his mental energy\nwas depleted. He had expended a lot of\nmental energy to hypnotize Eonyu. In\nfact, from the moment he met Eionu, he\nbegan to lay the groundwork for\nhypnosis. Whether it was looking at the\npocket watch repeatedly or smoking\njasmine scened cigarettes, it was all\nfor the purpose of hypnosis. Chapter 53.\nMy good friend, you finally arrived.\nDuring the battle with Yion. Thanks to\nthe preparations made over the past few\ndays and the addition of a large amount\nof mental energy, he successfully\naltered Yion's perception. There is a\ndisease in this world called\nproopagnosia, face blindness. People\nwith proopagnosia usually cannot\ndistinguish faces. In the eyes of people\nwith proopagnosia, everyone looks pretty\nmuch the same. Sumu used this principle\nto modify Yion's perception, causing him\nto see everyone as Sumu. Hypnotizing\nsuperhumans is a very mentally taxing\ntask. Fortunately, Yion's mental\nresistance is clearly not as good as\nYong Donings. He guessed that it was\nbecause of the difference in their\nabilities. One is the five fingers flame\nbullet and the other is the iron heart.\nEach extraordinary ability will bring an\nall round enhancement to the\nextraordinary person. But this\nenhancement has a focus. For example,\nwhile the five fingers flame bullet\nenhanced Yion's physical fitness and\nmental strength, it focused more on his\naffinity for and resistance to flames.\nYang Donging&lt;unk&gt;s iron will did not\ngrant him the ability to control flames,\nbut it did enhance his physical\nabilities and mental resistance. Through\nhis understanding of the extraordinary,\nSumu increasingly felt that he was not\nan extraordinary person because his\nenhancement was not comprehensive at\nall, but severely unbalanced with no\nother bonuses besides the enhancement of\nmental power. He went to sleep at this\nmoment mainly to restore his mental\nstrength in order to prepare for\nhypnotizing Tinking. Otherwise, unless\nthere were special circumstances, he\nwould not have chosen to sleep at all,\nas sleeping would only hasten his death.\nNight, you're finally awake,\" Young\nDoning said softly. Sumu slowly opened\nhis eyes. The intense pain in his brain\nmade him frown slightly. Suddenly, he\nfelt a warm sensation in his nose and\neye sockets. \"Sumu and I, leader,\" Yong\nDonging and the others quickly\nsurrounded him, looking at Su Mu in\nsurprise. Sumu was in very bad\ncondition. Blood was flowing from his\nnose and eyes, making his already pale\nface even paler. He took the\nhandkerchief Shiao Xiao Yao offered,\nremoved his brown tinted glasses, gently\nwiped the blood off his face, and said\nwith a faint smile, \"It's all right. I\nfeel much better after a good night's\nsleep.\" \"You don't look well at all. You\nlook like you're about to die,\" Yong\nDoning said bluntly. Sumu put his brown\ntinted glasses back on. \"It's the\nfeeling of being on the verge of death\nthat makes me feel much better.\" Yong\nDonaing. He paused for a moment before\nsaying, \"Didn't you say we'd find\nTinking by tonight? Let's&lt;unk&gt; go.\" Sumu\ndid not get up and remained seated in\nthe chair. \"No need to set off. Just\nwait here. Wait.\" Yong Doning frowned.\n\"Wait here for Tinking to show up on her\nown.\" Sumu slowly shook his head. \"No,\nwe're&lt;unk&gt; waiting for the shadow.\" \"A\nshadowy figure?\" Yong Donging exclaimed\nin surprise. \"What are you waiting for?\nDo you want to be taken away by the\nshadowy figure again? Haven't&lt;unk&gt; you\nrealized it yet? Sumu pushed up his\nglasses, completely concealing his dark\nand unfathomable eyes. Think carefully.\nHave the shadowy figure and Ting ever\nappeared at the same time? Yang Donging\nwas taken aback. He recalled the\nprevious scene in his mind. Back at\nTing&lt;unk&gt;s house after dark, Ting said\nshe was going out to find her sister and\nthen left. Only after that did the dark\nfigure appear. But what is that proof?\nMaybe it's just a coincidence. Ting went\nout after dark and the shadow appeared\nafter dark. Perhaps they just happened\nto miss each other. Sumu smiled\nslightly. At first, I also thought it\nwas a coincidence, but do you know who\nthe first person I saw after I walked\nout of the darkness was? Could it be?\nYong Dong&lt;unk&gt;s face instantly turned\nugly. It's&lt;unk&gt; Ting. Sumu nodded. So,\nyou're guessing that Ting is the shadowy\nfigure. Sigh. Sumu sighed repeatedly,\nrubbing his forehead. Such a blockhead.\nSuch a blockhead. Did you waste your\ntime watching time silhouette? That was\nthe only time Tinking appeared in the\nsame frame as the shadow, so Tinking\ncouldn't be the shadow. Yong Donging,\nfeeling a bit annoyed by what he was\nbeing said, retorted angrily, \"Then what\nexactly do you mean? My point is simple.\nThe shadowy figure has been parasitizing\nTinking ever since that incident. When I\nemerged from the darkness earlier, I\nvaguely sensed a faint connection\nbetween myself and the shadowy figure,\nbut that connection was very weak and\nbarely perceptible. I suspect that\nanyone who passes the shadows test will\ngain its approval and be parasetized. It\nchose to parasetize Tinking, which is\nwhy the connection to me is so weak.\nOtherwise, what do you think the shadowy\nfigure is doing? Just to invite you to\ntake a walk. Also, why is Tinking's past\nincluded in the shadowy figure? Where is\nthe shadowy figure during the day? Given\nthat the shadowy figure fears light, it\ncan only hide in dark corners or perhaps\nin the shadow of a person. Xiao Xiao Yao\nanswered quickly. Snap. Sumu clapped his\nhands and said to Yong Dongching with a\nlook of disappointment. Even this\nmusclebound guy is smarter than you,\nYong Doning. There's a reason why you're\nnot doing well in your studies. Yong\nDona&lt;unk&gt;s fist hardened. Xiao Xiao Yao\nscratched his bald head sheepishly, his\nface beaming, clearly pleased with the\nleader's praise. Yaong Doning retorted\nstubbornly. What you're saying is just\nspeculation. What if the shadow isn't\nhiding in ting shadow, but in some dark\ncorner? Sumu became increasingly\nhelpless. Yang Doning, do you know that\nsometimes those who raise questions are\nnot necessarily smart people, but may\nalso be self-righteous fools? In nature,\neven animals with lower intelligence\nthan humans know how to seek advantage\nand avoid harm, let alone a nightmare\ncreature like the shadow. If you were\nthe shadow, where would you feel\nabsolutely safe hiding? Yong Donging was\nspeechless because he had also figured\nit out. The safest place in the whole\nnightmare was definitely in the shadow\nof Tinking, the source of the nightmare.\nIt seems you understand now. This is why\nI emerged from the darkness. And the\nfirst person I saw was Tinking. It's\nbecause I came out of Tinking's shadow.\nChief, look. Ziao Xiao suddenly\nexclaimed, his tiger-like eyes fixed on\nthe shadow in the corner of the room.\nEveryone turned to look and saw a shadow\nsurging in the dark corner. Gradually,\nit transformed into a human figure, tall\nand slender, like a giant more than 2\nmeters tall who was now just bones. Its\nhands were long and almost touching the\nground, and a pair of scarlet eyes\nslowly opened at the position of its\nhead. Sumu smiled slightly. Good friend,\nyou finally arrived. He leaned on his\nsnake patterned wooden cane and slowly\nwalked to the shadowy figure. Before the\nother person could extend his hand, he\nhad already reached out his own. whether\nit was an illusion or not. The dark\nfigure seemed to pause for a moment when\nfaced with the pair of fair and slender\nhands in front of it. Chapter 54. Help\nme. Are you worthy? A moment later, the\ndark figure slowly raised its slender,\nthin hand, then reached past Sumu and\ntowards Yong Donging and the others.\nSumu&lt;unk&gt;s smile gradually faded, and he\nexpressionlessly pushed up his brown\ntinted glasses. That's a bit impolite.\nAfter saying that, he grabbed the\nshadowy figure's hand and said firmly,\n\"Today, you can only invite me.\" To be\nhonest, Sumu didn't want the shadowy\nfigure to invite others because it was\ntoo risky. Yang Donging was just a fool.\nOnce he entered the dark illusion, he\ndidn't even need to be lied to. As soon\nas Jasmine's voice came out, the idiot\nwould definitely open his eyes. Xiao\nXiao and the others were no match for\nhim. He could hypnotize them and make\nthem absolutely not open their eyes. But\nthere was a drawback to this. Once his\nvoice appeared in the illusion, these\npeople would definitely obey. The\nshadowy figure looked at its hand being\nheld in its crimson eyes, remained\nsilent for a moment and finally chose to\npull Sumu slowly into the darkness. You\nguys go wait outside. Once I find Ting,\nI'll set fire to the nearest house.\nSumu's calm voice disappeared into the\ndarkness. Darkness? Deathly silence.\nWith his eyes closed, Sumu was led by\nhis best friend through the darkness\nlike a guide dog leading a blind person.\nGradually, he began to hear various\nvoices. Yianu, Yong, Donqing, Xiao,\nXiao, Yao, Ting, Ting. It was the same\nridiculous illusion as always. Sumu was\nalready too tired to even complain. His\nattention wasn't on the illusion at all,\nbut on himself. This time, in order to\nhypnotize Tinking, he did not expend his\nfull mental energy, which resulted in a\nhuge burden on his body. He could even\nhear his bones creaking under the\nstrain. With every step he took, he\nbegan to bleed from his eyes, nose,\nears, mouth, and all seven orififices.\nBlood flowed uncontrollably from all of\nthem. But he did not stop, even though\nhe might die. Sometimes he even thought\nthat he hadn't died at the hands of the\nnightmare monster or at the hands of\nEphanu, and that he might end up dying\nfrom walking. But none of that matters\nnow. Even if he doesn't die now, he will\ndie when he returns to reality because\nhe has not yet become a superhuman.\nSumu, do you want to become a superhum?\nA strange voice rang out in the\ndarkness. A mocking smile appeared on\nSumu's lips. He knew that the illusion\nhad sensed his wandering thoughts and\nwas starting to play new tricks. Sumu, I\nam the only one who can help you. Hidden\ndeep in this darkness is the source of\nthe power of the shadows. As long as you\nseize it, you can become a superhum, and\nI can also escape. You may not believe\nme, but you know your own physical\ncondition. No matter what, you're going\nto die. Why not take a gamble? If you\nwin the gamble, there's still a glimmer\nof hope. If you lose, there's no real\nloss since you're going to die anyway.\nUpon hearing this, Sumu smiled slightly.\nA very tempting suggestion. In the\ndarkness, a hint of joy crept into the\nunfamiliar voice. You're a smart person.\nYou'll definitely make the right choice.\nSum Mu&lt;unk&gt;s smile widened. But what\nright do you, a piece of trash who can't\neven escape the shadow illusion, have to\nhelp me? Are you worthy? The voices in\nthe darkness fell silent. After a long\nsilence, he said, I was simply caught\noff guard and ended up here. If only,\nhar. The weak always have an excuse\nwhile the successful are simply standing\nthere. That is the only truth. Get out\nof here, whoever you are, don't\nembarrass yourself. At this point, the\nsounds in the darkness fell completely\nsilent. After a long while, Sumu felt\nthe dark figure's hand disappear and\nthen opened his eyes. As he expected,\nwhen he opened his eyes again, he saw\nTinking again. He wiped the blood off\nhis face with a handkerchief and walked\ntowards Tinking. This is a cemetery with\nmany tombstones standing crookedly, and\nTinking small body is squatting in front\nof one of the tombstones, crying,\n\"Grandma, don't you want Tinking\nanymore? Ting brought you your favorite\ndumplings.\" The child's innocent voice\ncarried a sorrow that even adults could\nnot bear. While Tinking was crying, she\nsuddenly felt a large hand stroking her\nhead. She turned around and saw a gentle\nsmiling face. \"Big brother,\" Tinting\nexclaimed with surprise, her eyes red-\nrimmed. \"Tinkedting, be good. Grandma\ndidn't abandon you.\" Sumu said gently,\n\"Big brother, do you know where Grandma\nwent?\" Tinting looked at Sumu with her\nbig bright eyes full of expectation.\nSumu smiled gently. \"Of course I know.\nBig Brother not only knows where grandma\nwent, but also where your parents and\nsister are. Really, Big Brother? That's\ngreat. Tinking jumped up happily, her\nface beaming with a pure and innocent\nsmile. This was the first time Sumu had\never seen Tinking smile so happily. Of\ncourse, it's true. Big Brother never\nlies. Sumu patted Tinking&lt;unk&gt;s little\nhead. Big Brother, please tell Tinking\nwhere they are. They're playing\nhideand-seek with Tinking. They'll\nappear when the time is up. How long\nwill it take? Tinting asked, tilting her\nhead. Sumu smiled slightly and took out\npocket. The mysterious Urao&lt;unk&gt;'s\nsymbol caught Tinking&lt;unk&gt;s eye. See\nthis pointer? When it points to 12, they\nwill all appear. Tinctting clapped her\nhands excitedly. Great. Great. Ting is\ngoing to see her mom and dad, grandma,\nand little sister. Tinting, take this\npocket watch. Big brother has some\nthings to do. Okay, big brother. Tinting\nsmiled sweetly. Then Sumu went to a tree\nnot far away, took out cigarettes and a\nlighter, lit all the cigarettes, and\nthrew them onto the dry leaves, guiding\nthe flames little by little until the\nwhole tree was ablaze with flames and\nblack smoke shooting into the sky.\nTinking, shall we play a game? Upon\nhearing the word game, Tinking was\nclearly frightened and unconsciously\ncurled up. Sumu smiled gently and took\nthe pocket watch from Tinking's hand.\nThis game is called time acceleration.\nTime acceleration. Ting ting. Being a\nchild at heart was unconsciously drawn\nin. Yes. Actually, my older brother is a\nmagician who can speed up time. Really,\nBig Brother? If time speeds up, will\nTinking be able to see her mom and dad\nsoon? Of course, it's true. You forgot.\nBig Brother never lies. Okay, now Big\nBrother is going to start his\nperformance. Sumu loosened his grip on\nthe pocket watch, letting it hang\nnaturally. The chain at the end was\ncaught between his fingers, and with a\nslight pull, the dark gold pocket watch\nbegan to swing like a pendulum. Chapter\n55. Die, you bastard. Tinting, take a\ncloser look. Aren't the hands of the\npocket watch moving faster? Tinting\nquickly opened her eyes wide, her pupils\nfollowing the movement of the pocket\nwatch. The crisp sound of the second\nhand moving reached her ears. It seems\nit really has gotten faster. That's\ngreat, big brother. Tinting, you'd\nbetter watch carefully or you'll slack\noff on time. Okay. Tinting nodded\nvigorously. Tinting will keep a close\neye on things and not let time slack\noff. Time passed second by second, and\nbefore anyone knew it, Sumu had taken\noff his brown glasses, revealing a faint\nethereal light emanating from his deep\neyes. An invisible spiritual force\nsurged forth. He is trying to hypnotize\nTinking, which is the biggest challenge\nof this project. Even he himself doesn't\nknow if the hypnosis will be successful.\nAfter all, Tinking is not human, but a\nnightmare creature. Previous attempts to\nhypnotize the villagers and the shadowy\nfigure had all failed. But Sumu felt\nthere was still a chance because the\nvillagers were clearly being manipulated\nand were like walking corpses, and\nhypnosis would not work on corpses. The\nshadowy figure, this nightmare monster,\nis no ordinary being. It can construct a\ndark illusion, a feat that even with his\ncurrent mental strength, he cannot\nachieve. Only Ting is different. She is\nthe subject of the dream and has her own\nconsciousness. Even if her mental\nstrength is stronger than his, she still\nhas a chance to succeed because\nTing&lt;unk&gt;s mind is like that of a child\nand she has no sense of\nself-preservation. The essence of\nhypnosis is never about crushing the\nother person's spirit, but about guiding\nthem and bringing their spirit into your\nown rhythm. This was a highstakes\ngamble. If you win, you return to\nreality. If you lose, you die in a\nnightmare world. Fortunately, Sumu won\nhis gamble. He discovered that his\nmental power could invade Tinking's\nbody. Ting&lt;unk&gt;s mental power was very\nstrong, far stronger than his own, which\nwas normal. After all, Ting was the main\nbody of this dream world. However,\nTing&lt;unk&gt;s mental energy was very\npeaceful, like a calm sea, clear and\npure. What Sumu needs to do is guide\nTing&lt;unk&gt;s mental energy little by\nlittle, thereby changing her dream. Just\nas he was making his efforts, Yong\nDongqing and the others finally arrived\nand saw the fire that Su Mu had set off.\nYong Dongqing and the others did not\ndisturb Su Mu and Tinking. They already\nknew about Su Mu&lt;unk&gt;s plan and simply\nwatched quietly from a distance.\nGradually, Yong Donging and the others\nwere surprised to find that this place\nseemed to be undergoing some kind of\ninexplicable change. The sky. The sky.\nXiao Xiao Yao stared at the sky in\nshock, his mouth agape, speechless for a\nlong time. Yong Dongqing was no better\noff. He was also dumbfounded. The\nchanges in the sky were truly\nterrifying. The once aure sky was now\ncovered with spiderweb like cracks\nresembling a shattered mirror. Not only\nthat, the surrounding trees also began\nto distort as if they had been\npixelated, becoming extremely blurry.\nLooking at the houses in the distance,\nthey saw that the houses seemed to be\nbeing violently crushed by an invisible\ngiant hand, collapsing one after\nanother, raising clouds of dust, and the\nground began to tremble. Farmland was\ntorn apart, revealing bottomless\nravines. Sumu is going to succeed. Yong\nDonging exclaimed with elation. This\nshould be a sign that the nightmare is\nabout to be shattered. Roar. Countless\ninhuman roars interrupted Yong\nDonging&lt;unk&gt;s ecstasy. Everyone's\nexpression changed drastically as they\nturned around to look. They saw one\nvillager after another emerging from the\nwoods not far away. The villagers looked\neven more horrifying. Their skin melted\nlike candle wax dripping onto the\nground. These beasts, Yong Doning, who\nhad been suppressing his anger for a\nlong time, erupted like a volcano when\nhe saw the villagers appear and blood\nvessels appeared in his eyes. I'll [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\nyou all, you bastards. You all have to\ndie. Yong Dongqing roared and charged\ntoward the hundreds of villagers while\nZiao Xiao Yao and the others guarded the\narea near Sumu to prevent any from\nescaping and disturbing the leader. With\nthe blessing of iron will, Yong\nDongqing&lt;unk&gt;s body erupted with an\nunprecedented metallic luster, and every\nmuscle of his seemed to be cast in\nsteel, containing terrifying power. Ah,\nwith that roar, he stomped his feet on\nthe ground, cracking the earth beneath\nhim. Using the recoil, he crashed into\nthe surging crowd like a cannonball.\nDie. Yang Doning swung his iron fists\nlike falling meteors, accompanied by a\nchilling whistling sound. With each\npunch, a villager's head exploded like a\nwatermelon, brains and blood splattering\neverywhere. His legs swept across like a\ndragon's tail, carrying immense force.\nWherever they went, villagers bodies\nwere cut in half at the waist, their\nbroken bodies flying through the air,\ntheir internal organs spilling onto the\nground. In an instant, a bloody storm\nswept through the crowd. After becoming\nstronger, Yong Doning strength clearly\nrose to another level. Even when\nsurrounded, the villagers found it\ndifficult to break through his defenses.\nHe suddenly grabbed a villager, lifted\nhim high above his head, and then tore\nhim in two with both hands. The broken\nlimbs and internal organs falling like\nrain. However, while the villagers may\nfind it difficult to break through his\ndefenses, it doesn't mean they can't\nrestrain him. The villagers are equally\npowerful. Some villagers who were only\nleft with their upper bodies tightly\nwrapped their arms around Yong\nDoning&lt;unk&gt;s legs. Caught off guard,\nYong Donging tripped and fell. Then the\nsurrounding villagers swarmed over him,\npinning him down, and countless gaping\nmouths began to tear at Yong Dong&lt;unk&gt;s\nbody. Yong Donging struggled\ndesperately, but he was no match for the\noverwhelming number of villagers.\nGradually, even his steely body began to\nbreak. Xiao Xiao Yao and the others were\nunable to come forward to help. They\nwere fighting with a few survivors, but\nas ordinary people, how could they\npossibly be a match for the nightmare\nmonsters? In just a few moments, Shiao\nXiao Yao and the others were knocked\naway by the villagers. The villagers\nignored the fallen people and rushed\nstraight towards Sumu. Protect the\nleader, Xiao Xiao shouted. At that\nmoment, a fearless henchman unleashed\nhis life force, dragging his heavily\nwounded body towards the villagers,\nshouting, \"Long live the leader.\" He\nthen pounced on the villager, using his\nweight to knock him down, and together\nthey fell into the huge crack in the\nground and disappeared. Seeing this, the\nother underlings followed suit. Their\nmortal bodies were indeed no match for\nthe nightmare monster, but they could\nchoose to die with it, for their leader,\nfor the faith in their hearts. These\nmortals, like ants, roared in their\nfinal moments, rushing towards the\nvillagers and dragging them into the\ncracks in the earth. Chapter 56. Father,\nmother, grandmother, sister. Ah, you\nbeast. Yang Doning, who was pinned down,\nhad bloodshot eyes. He looked at the\nvillagers who were tearing at his body\nand opened his mouth without hesitation.\nHis metallic teeth bit down hard on a\nvillager's throat. At this critical\njuncture of life and death, Sumu is\nfinally about to succeed. Big brother,\nthe pointer has already pointed to 12,\nwhere our mom and dad, Tinking&lt;unk&gt;s\neyes were empty and lifeless. Clearly,\nshe had completely entered a hypnotic\nstate. Sumu put away his pocket watch,\nslowly stood up, and behind him were\ncountless severed limbs and remains, a\nbroken earth, and a shattered sky. He\nsmiled gently, reached out his hand\namidst the apocalyptic scene, and patted\nTing&lt;unk&gt;s head. Tinking, close your\neyes and listen carefully. Your mom and\ndad are calling you. Tinking obediently\nclosed her eyes. Tinking. Mom and dad\nare here to pick you up. A doting male\nvoice and a gentle female voice rang out\nin succession, followed by the\ngrandmother's aged voice. Ting, are you\nhungry? Come home with us. Grandma will\nmake you dumplings. Sister, come play\nwith me. Several voices entered\nTing&lt;unk&gt;s ears, and her small body\ntrembled slightly. Even with her eyes\ntightly closed, she could not hold back\nher crystal tears. Ting, open your eyes\nquickly. They've come to take you home.\nSum Mu&lt;unk&gt;s gentle voice rang out. Ting\nopened her eyes, her small body\ntrembling as she turned around. In that\nvoid, Dad, Mom, Grandma, and sister\nstood quietly, their faces bearing\ngentle, loving smiles as they waved to\nTinking. Mom and dad, Grandma, Sister.\nTinting sobbed uncontrollably. Tinking\nmisses you all so much. This little\nperson threw himself into the arms of\nhis family without hesitation. At this\nmoment, Ting was happy. She had finally\nfound her family. Sumu stood quietly in\nplace. In his vision, he only saw\nTinking crying alone. In fact, even the\nsound just now was imitated by him using\nthe ventriloquism he learned from his\ndream. He didn't know if he had\nsucceeded or failed. He had indeed\nsuccessfully hypnotized Tinking, but the\nnightmare could never seem to turn into\na beautiful dream. Tinting, let's go\nhome with your mom and dad. The\nunfamiliar man and woman lovingly\nstroked Tinking&lt;unk&gt;s hair. Tinking\nnodded vigorously, and a smile returned\nto her innocent face like a flower\nblooming in spring, pure and radiant.\nShe followed her family step by step\ntoward nothingness. Slowly, her small\nbody began to blur and become elucery,\nas if it too was about to merge into\nnothingness. But just then, Tinting\nsuddenly stopped. \"Mom and dad, grandma\nand little sister, please wait for\nTinking.\" After saying that, the little\ngirl turned around and ran back. She ran\nstraight to Sumu and smiled sweetly.\n\"Thank you, big brother. Thank you for\nhelping me find them. You're welcome,\nTinking. Go home now.\" Sumu smiled\ngently. Tinting nodded vigorously. Then\na hint of hesitation appeared on her\nface. She leaned close to Su Mu and\nwhispered, \"Big brother, let me tell you\na secret. Actually, Tinting lied\nbefore.\" Tinting secretly hid a\ndumpling. As she spoke, she stretched\nout her dirty little hand and pulled a\ncrumpled, spoiled dumpling from her\npocket. Tinting knows that her older\nbrother hasn't eaten either, so she\nwants to save this dumpling for him.\nTinting&lt;unk&gt;s voice grew softer and\nsofter, like a child who felt guilty for\ndoing something wrong. Big brother, is\nTinking a bad child who lies? Sumu took\nthe dumplings, bent down, and gently\nwiped away the undried tears on\nTinking&lt;unk&gt;s face. He spoke slowly, his\ntone gentle yet firm, as if stating a\nfact. Tinting is the best child in the\nworld. Really? Ting tilted her head\nback, her big eyes sparkling with\nsurprise. A gentle smile spread across\nSu Mu&lt;unk&gt;s face as he patted Ting&lt;unk&gt;s\nhead. Of course, it's true because Big\nBrother never lies. That's wonderful.\nTing is the best child in the world. Go\nhome. Don't keep your parents waiting.\nOkay. Goodbye, Big Brother. Goodbye,\nTinking. Ting left, and Sumu watched her\nwalk further and further away, her\nfigure becoming more and more ethereal.\nEven so, Tinking was still waving\nvigorously, a happy smile on her face as\nshe was about to disappear. In a days,\nSumu seemed to see several blurry\nfigures around Tinking. Their appearance\nexactly the same as those in the family\nphoto. Boom! The world completely\ncollapsed and everything was swallowed\nby darkness.\nThe headquarters of the Viper gang. Sumu\nopened his eyes and looked around. He\nfound himself still lying on the soft\nbed as if everything before had been a\ndream. However, it did indeed smell of\nblood. Ah. Yong Donging suddenly roared\nand sprang to his feet. After taking in\nhis surroundings, a look of confusion\nflashed in his eyes. You're back. Chief,\nare you all right? Xiao Xia Yao, covered\nin blood, limped to the bedside. Sumu\nslowly stood up, his gaze sweeping\naround, and found that only Yong\nDongqing and Xiao Xiao remained of the\npeople who had been in the room. Just\nthen, a man in a white coat came running\nin a flustered manner. Chief, you're\nfinally back. You've been missing for\nthree whole days. Bring me the previous\nrecordings, Sumu ordered. The man in the\nwhite coat quickly brought over the\nvideo. Sumu stared at it and saw the\nscene after everyone fell asleep about 2\nminutes after falling asleep. Everyone\nseemed to have been wiped away by\nsomething and disappeared into thin air.\nThis also shows that the nightmare\napostle entered the nightmare world not\nwith his soul, but with his body. In\nfact, Sumu already knew this. If it were\ntruly a soul entering his body, he would\nnever be so weak. With his soul\nstrength, he would definitely be the\nstrongest among them. All right,\neveryone. You can all leave now. Sumuyu,\nthe heavily injured Yong Donging\nhesitated before speaking. I said,\neveryone get out. Sumu dismissed\neveryone and lay alone on the bed,\ncalmly staring at the ceiling. Yes, he's\ngoing to die. In the end, did I still\nfail? He murmured to himself, his eyes\nshowing no fear of death, only endless\nemptiness and boredom. He originally\nthought that entering the nightmare\nworld would allow him to become a\nsuperhuman, but fate played a cruel\ntrick on him. Even though he\nsuccessfully resolved the nightmare, he\nstill had no hope of becoming a\nsuperhuman. His body had reached its\nlimit, and he was absolutely certain\nthat if he took another nap, he would\nwake up to find his body bursting from\nthe overflowing mental energy. Chapter\n57. The Immaculate Heart. How boring.\nSumu sighed. If he had never seen the\nwonders of the nightmare world, perhaps\nit wouldn't matter if he died like this.\nJust like a person who has always lived\nin darkness and has long been accustomed\nto it, if he had never seen the light.\nThe door to a new world has just opened,\nbut he is about to die. TCH, what a\nboring life. Sumu rolled over and pulled\na crumpled dumpling out of his pocket.\nThe dumpling wrappers were already\nshriveled and smelled sour. They were\nthe ones Tincting had secretly hidden\nwhen Yion Fonu snatched them from her.\nHe put the dumpling in his mouth, chewed\nit gently, and then swallowed it. It's\ndelicious. Sumu slowly closed his eyes,\ndrifted into sleep, and quietly awaited\ndeath. But the next second, he suddenly\nopened his eyes, his dark eyes gleaming\nwith a terrifying light that even his\nbrown tinted glasses couldn't hide.\nHaha. An uncontrollable burst of\nlaughter erupted from Sumu's mouth. He\nwas as happy as a child who had received\na new toy. I love surprises like this.\nHe raised his palm and watched the\nchanges on it. His slender, fair palm\nwas emitting a soft white light. He has\nalways relied on a snakeskin cane to\nwalk, so his right hand rubs against the\ncane everyday. In addition, his skin is\nnaturally thin, so some faint calluses\ninevitably remain on his palms. But now\nthose calluses are disappearing at a\nspeed visible to the naked eye, and her\nalready fair hands became even more warm\nand smooth, giving people a feeling of\ncrystal clearar jade. He suddenly sat up\nin bed, his body feeling incredibly\nlight, a gentle and pure power bursting\nforth from him like a silent spring rain\nnourishing the parched earth. He stood\nin front of the mirror and discovered\nthat even his appearance had suddenly\nchanged. Before he had thin cheeks, pale\nskin, and bloodless lips, which\ninevitably gave people a harsh and cold\nfeeling. But now his cheeks have become\nslightly fuller, and his skin is no\nlonger as pale as a dead person's.\nInstead, it is a healthy, clean white,\nlike mutton fat jade, and his lips have\nbecome rosy. Sumu smiled at himself in\nthe mirror, looking like a gentle and\nrefined gentleman, making it hard for\nanyone to dislike him. His first\nimpression of the new skin was that it\nwas clean, spotless, as if you couldn't\nscrub off any dirt even after going to a\npublic bath house. At the same time, his\nmental energy began to shrink, or\nrather, it was purified. A magical power\nremoved all the impurities from his\nmental energy, reducing its total\namount, but greatly increasing its\npurity. Suddenly, Sumu looked up at the\nsky. His gaze seemed to traverse endless\ndimensions. And finally he saw a net, an\ninvisible and intangible yet omnipresent\nnet. Each note on it twinkled with a\nstar like the cosmic starry sky.\nMysterious and magnificent. The moment\nhe saw the net, he naturally learned its\nname. Bronze law. Above the bronze law,\nat one of the nodes, there was a star as\nwhite as jade. It cast its white light\ndown and landed on Sumu. In an instant,\nan invisible connection was established\nbetween the two. Sumu finally understood\nthe reason for his own changes. He\nbecame a superhuman and gained\nsuperhuman power which he named the\nimmaculate heart, a gift from Tinking.\nSumu smiled silently. This pure and\ninnocent little girl had selflessly\nshared her power. Perhaps only such a\nperson can possess a pure and immaculate\nheart. He carefully sensed the power\nbrought by the immaculate heart as if he\nhad possessed it from birth. The moment\nhe obtained the immaculate heart, he\nclearly understood its function.\nImmaculate heart transforms the owner's\nbody into an immaculate form, slightly\nenhancing physical and mental strength,\ngreatly increasing the purity of the\nbody and mind and providing strong\nimmunity to all impurities. The filth\nhere refers to toxins, curses, abnormal\nstates, negative emotions, etc. Strictly\nspeaking, the immaculate heart is not a\nvery powerful ability, and it doesn't\neven have any active ability. It's all\npassive. It might be favored by some\nwomen who love beauty. It doesn't have\nthe powerful destructive force of the\nfive fingers flame bullet. Nor does it\nhave the super strong defensive power of\nthe iron heart. But none of that\nmatters. What matters is that he\nsurvived. The immaculate heart enhanced\nSu Mu's physical fitness and purified\nhis total spiritual energy, effectively\nextending his lifespan in two ways.\nAccording to his estimate, he could live\nfor at least another year. Is this what\nit feels like to be alive? Not bad. Sumu\nlay back down on the bed, a peaceful\nsmile on his lips, and slowly drifted\noff to sleep. He hadn't had a good\nnight's sleep in a very, very long time\nbecause every time he slept, he was\nconsuming his life force and getting\ncloser to death. This time, he could\nfinally get a good night's sleep. Chief,\nwelcome to the capital. We will soon be\nchecking into the presidential suite at\nthe Manland Caesar Ton Hotel. Please\nmake do with what you have. Your private\nestate is not yet completed. It is my\nfault for not supervising the\nconstruction properly. Please punish me.\nA middle-aged butler in a tail coat with\nhis hair neatly combed said\nrespectfully. Sumu nodded and led by the\nbutler entered the most luxurious hotel\nin the capital. Your room is on the\n118th floor which is currently the\nhighest suite in the capital. The hotel\njust asked me to tell you that your\narrival is a glorious moment in their\nhotel's history. Okay, I understand. You\nmay leave. Sumu entered the room, lay\ndown alone on the luxurious bed, and\nclosed his eyes to prepare for sleep.\nIt's a magical experience to fall asleep\nin a dream. It's mainly because there's\nnothing he can do about it. He appears\nin dreams whenever he falls asleep, but\nhe gets tired of dreams and just wants\nto rest, so he can only sleep in his\ndreams. Nothing was said that night. The\nnext morning, Sumu woke up from his\ndream, stretched comfortably, and was\nabout to get out of bed when his\nexpression changed slightly. full again.\nHe was surprised to find that his\noriginally concentrated mental energy\nhad been replenished and strengthened by\n1% after he took a nap. If his total\nmental energy was 100 before, it became\n50 after being condensed. He thought\nthat after sleeping it would increase by\n1% of 50, but he did not expect that the\ncondensed 50 would be replenished and\nthe replenishment was high purity mental\nenergy. In the end, it still increased\nby 1% according to 100. This means that\ncompressing mental energy is completely\nuseless. Fortunately, the physical\nenhancement brought by the immaculate\nheart took effect, preventing Sumu from\nbeing on the verge of death again.\nHowever, he had previously estimated\nthat he could live for a year, but now\nhe has to recalculate and think he can\nprobably live for another month. Sumu\nchuckled. Fate is truly capricious. How\ninteresting. He got out of bed without\nwashing up because he didn't need to at\nall. He was spotless and washing up\nwould be a waste of water. He planned to\nmeet with his men and work on the next\nstep of the plan. He had just taken a\nstep when a sudden dizziness hit his\nhead. His mental energy was surging\ninexplicably and even the eyes behind\nhis brown glasses turned azure, crystal\nclear like sapphires reflecting\nsunlight. This is Sumu was surprised to\nfind that just now another bronze law\nhad appeared in his body. Strangely, he\ndid not connect to the great network of\nbronze laws at all. It was as if he\nalready possessed it. It was only\nbecause his spiritual power reached a\ncertain limit that it was generated\nnaturally. Chapter 58. The myriad\nphenomena of nature. Sumu, who knew very\nlittle about the extraordinary, was\nunaware of what had happened or where\nthis extra bronze law came from. The\nonly thing he knew was that this bronze\nlaw was called all things in the\nuniverse. The turmoil of his mental\nenergy continued for a moment before\ngradually subsiding. Once calm, Sumu\nbegan to sort out his thoughts. The\nfirst thing he could be sure of was that\nhe had obtained the myriad phenomena\nafter taking a nap. It seemed to be an\nability independent of the bronze laws\nbecause it was not on the bronze laws\nnetwork at all. This is absurd. As far\nas he knows, all the abilities of\nsuperhumans come from the bronze law.\nHow could there be abilities independent\nof the bronze law? Could it be? Sumu had\na vague idea about his dream. Perhaps\nthis mysterious dream was a completely\nindependent law. a law that was only\nrelated to the mind. With so little\nknown information, he could only deduce\nthese things. After thinking for a\nmoment, forget it. Let's just live\nfirst. This unexpected joy isn't bad\neither. Sumu smiled. He wouldn't worry\nunnecessarily. The secrets of the dream\nmight only be revealed when he became\nstronger. For now, all he could do was\naccept it calmly. Furthermore, he was\nvery satisfied with the abilities of all\nthings in the world. Jasmine, you sing\nso beautifully. In a coffee shop, Yong\nDoning looked at Jasmine beside him with\naffection. Jasmine had just finished her\nperformance and hadn't had time to\nchange out of her costume. It was a\nlight blue long dress with a fitted cut\nthat perfectly outlined her graceful\ncurves. The skirt cascaded down like a\nwaterfall, and the upper body featured\nan off-shoulder design. Her fair\nshoulders and alluring collar bones made\nYong Daing unconsciously steal glances\nat her out of the corner of his eye.\nJasmine took a sip of coffee, her\nbeautiful eyes sparkling with\nanticipation for the future. She felt\nlike she was dreaming, as if she had\nescaped the mire of life overnight and\nemerged from it, transforming into a\ndazzling pearl. She achieved her dream\nand also found love. Really? You're not\nkidding me. This is my first time\nperforming on stage, and I was so\nnervous that I sang several words wrong.\nJasmine playfully stuck out her tongue,\nher delicate lips still covered with\ncoffee foam, making her look\nexceptionally charming. Yong Doning\nsubconsciously swallowed, feeling an\nurge to lick it. Of course, it's true.\nEven if you sing it wrong, it still\nsounds great. Jasmine smiled happily.\nThank you, Yong Dona. My fate began to\nchange after I met you. To be precise,\nit was after meeting Sumu, but Jasmine\ncouldn't possibly mention another man's\nname in front of her boyfriend. Don't\nsay that about Jasmine. It should be sir\nyour coffee. A waiter came over and\nplaced the coffee in front of Yong\nDonging. Yong Donging frowned slightly\nand looked at the waiter. I didn't order\ncoffee. The waiter smiled and pointed to\nthe corner of the coffee shop. This was\nordered for you by the lady over there.\nYong Donging turned his head and was\ntaken aback. He saw a woman sitting\nquietly in the corner of the coffee\nshop. She was like a quietly blooming\norchid, quiet and elegant, yet exuding a\nsilent charm. She wore a simple white\nsilk shirt with the neckline slightly\nopen, revealing her slender, fair neck\nand delicate collar bones. The cuffs of\nthe shirt were slightly rolled up, and\nshe wore an elegant women's watch on her\nslender wrist with a simple and\nunderstated style. She paired it with\nblack straightle widelegg pants, making\nit difficult to determine her leg shape.\nBut the only certainty was that her legs\nwere very long, longer than Jasmine's.\nWhat's most striking is her long flax\nand hair which radiates a warm and\ngentle luster under the caress of the\nsunlight. The slightly curled ends at a\ntouch of intellectual beauty. For some\nreason, the moment Yong Doning saw the\nwoman, he thought of Sumu. Their elegant\nand gentle demeanor was very similar. At\nthis moment, the woman seemed to notice\nsomething, turned her head slightly,\nrevealing a delicate profile, smiled,\nand lightly raised the white coffee cup\nin her hand in a simple gesture. You're\nnot allowed to drink it. Jasmine pouted\nlike a kitten guarding its food and said\nresentfully to Yong Doning. Yong Doning\ngave an awkward smile and looked away. I\ndon't know her. Please return this\ncoffee to her. The waiter looked\nembarrassed. Sir, I only serve coffee.\nIf you want to return it, please talk to\nthat lady yourself. Oh, by the way, it\nseems that lady also wrote something on\nthe napkin. After saying that, the\nwaiter left. Jasmine grabbed a napkin\nand said angrily, \"I want to see what\nshe wrote.\" Yong Doning felt\nincreasingly embarrassed, never\nexpecting that he was so popular with\ngirls. As a result, Jasmine was stunned\nwhen she opened the napkin, and her\nlittle face showed a bit of panic.\nJasmine Yang Donging realized something\nwas wrong, picked up the napkin, and\nlooked at it, only to find four words on\nit. Nightmare apostle. His expression\nchanged drastically as he stared\nintently at the sophisticated beauty in\nthe corner. She wore an elegant and\nreserved smile on her delicate face as\nif she were greeting a new friend.\nJasmine, you wait here. I'll go take a\nlook. Yong Doning got up and walked\ntowards the woman. Jasmine was a little\nnervous. She had been in contact with\nYong Doning for a while and already knew\nwhat the nightmare apostle meant. She\ncouldn't help but worry, but she was a\nsensible woman and wouldn't cause\ntrouble for her man. So, she didn't stop\nhim. She just gripped her phone tightly,\nopened her contacts, and tapped on\nSumu's number. If things go wrong, she\nwill call Sumu immediately. In her\nknowledge, only Sumu could help Yong\nDoning. Although Sumu was cold-blooded\nand ruthless, Yong Doning had agreed to\nwork for him for 3 years. So, Sumu\nprobably didn't want to lose a\nsubordinate for nothing. Who are you?\nYong Donging sat down in front of the\nwoman and asked in a cold voice. When he\nsaw the woman's face, he realized that\nhe had underestimated her beauty. Her\nface was even more beautiful than her\nprofile, and she was even more beautiful\nthan the stars on TV. The woman put down\nher coffee, gently tucked one side of\nher hair behind her ear to reveal her\ndelicate, fair earlobe, and smiled. \"Mr.\nYang, please forgive my intrusion. It's\na pleasure to meet you. This is my\nbusiness card.\" She handed over a\nbusiness card. Yang Donging took the\nbusiness card which read, \"Chairman of\nBronze Coffin Company Limited, Murang\nMungley.\" Upon seeing the name Muron\nMungly, his pupils contracted sharply\nand he exclaimed in horror, \"You're a\nnoble woman.\" Morungli seemed used to\nthis kind of expression and did not show\nany change in expression but simply\nsmiled and nodded politely. Yong Donging\ncouldn't help but gasp. At this moment,\nhe finally understood why he thought of\nSu Mu as soon as he saw Murong Mli.\nTheir damned aristocratic temperaments\nwere exactly the same. This was the\nfirst time he had met a nobleman. And\nthe main reason he was able to tell that\nthe other party was a nobleman was\nbecause of his name. Nobles all have\ncompound surnames. He was unfamiliar\nwith other countries, but he had heard\nof the nobles of the Crimson Flame\nEmpire. According to legend, the nobles\ninitially did not want to share the same\nsurname as commoners, feeling that it\nwas an insult to their noble status.\nTherefore, they changed their names to\ncompound surnames to distinguish\nthemselves from commoners. In the\nCrimson Flame Empire, only nobles have\ncompound surnames. Chapter 59. Imperial\nNobles. Why would nobles come to the\nlower city? Murong Mungly smiled and\nsaid, \"Of course, it's for running the\ncompany.\" Yong Dong&lt;unk&gt;s gaze grew\nincreasingly wary. He had no good\nimpression of the nobles. These nobles\nhad a terrible reputation throughout the\nCrimson Flame Empire. They were\narrogant, extravagant, and disrespectful\nof the law, treating ordinary people\nwith contempt and considering themselves\nsuperior. They were parasites on the\nempire. Of course, this was all said in\nprivate by the common people. They hated\nthe nobles, but they hated even more\nthat they were not nobles. I don't\nrecall having any dealings with nobles.\nWhat is your purpose, Mr. Yang? I can\nsee your disgust for the nobility in\nyour eyes. I will not claim to be any\ndifferent from them. The reason I came\nto you is to invite you to join my\ncompany, Bronze Coffin. I don't rush to\nrefuse. I know you've only recently\nbecome a nightmare apostle and are wary\nof everything. But it's actually quite\ncommon for nobles to form companies and\ninvite nightmare apostles to join. Most\nnightmare apostles choose to join the\ncompany. Why? Yong Doning frown. Mutual\nbenefit. Murang Mly stirred her coffee\ngently with a spoon. The spoon making a\ncrisp sound against the porcelain cup.\nMr. Yang, I don't need to elaborate on\nthe danger of nightmare apostles. When\ntraversing the nightmare world time and\ntime again, no one is sure how long they\ncan live. Therefore, most nightmare\napostles will accumulate enough wealth\nwhile they are still alive to leave to\ntheir family and friends. This is the\nmeaning of a company's existence.\nAlthough the nightmare world is\ndangerous, crisis always coexists with\nopportunity. Besides nightmare monsters,\nit also contains magical artifacts,\nextraordinary materials, and other\nthings that the company needs. Yong\nDonging sneered. You mean we nightmare\napostles are selling you what we risked\nour lives for? Moroni didn't care about\nYong Donging&lt;unk&gt;s hostility. She\nremained polite throughout, just like a\nfemale CEO conducting normal business.\nYou'll have to sell eventually, won't\nyou? Do you think anyone in this world\nbesides nobles can afford a good price?\nMr. Yang, I understand your concerns.\nPlease rest assured, I never engage in\nforce sales. After all, these things\nwere obtained by nightmare apostles at\nthe cost of their lives. I only want\nthings that you don't need. For example,\nyour bronze law is iron heart, and the\napplicable noble fantasms and\nextraordinary materials can only be of\nthe strength type. If you obtain a\nspirit type noble fantasm or material\nthat you don't need, then you can sell\nit to the company. Of course, joining\nthe company offers more than just this\nbenefit. There are also corresponding\nemployee perks. Besides a substantial\nmonthly base salary, there are also\nbenefits such as intelligence sharing,\nemployee mutual assistance, and the\nability to rent magical artifacts. Morly\nwas quite a catch, but Yong Doning\nnoticed something. You investigated me?\nYong Doning clenched his fists. A subtle\nmetallic hue appearing between his\nknuckles. Kid, here's a piece of advice.\nDon't bear your fangs in front of a\nstrong person. A calm male voice sounded\nbehind Yong Doning, who was instantly\nstartled because he hadn't noticed\nanyone standing behind him at all, just\nas he was preparing to react. Smack. A\nlarge, well-defined hand landed on his\nshoulder. And at that moment, Yong\nDoning felt as if a mountain was\npressing down on his shoulder. Even with\nall his might, he couldn't budge it an\ninch. He turned his head in disbelief\nand saw a man in a black trench coat and\nsunglasses standing there with an\nindifferent expression. The so-called\nsteel body is like a toy in this big\nhand and it will break with the\nslightest squeeze. Hanu Murong Moonly\nfrowned slightly, seemingly somewhat\ndissatisfied. The man in sunglasses\nnamed Hanu shrugged and released his\ngrip. Boss, I was just giving him a\nwarning. From now on, do not act without\nmy orders. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Mungly s voice was not\nloud, but it was filled with an\nundeniable calmness. Han Yu nodded\ncasually. You're the boss. You make the\ndecisions. He casually walked to the\nside, sat down, and said nothing more.\nYang Doning looked at Han Yu with some\nfear, his heart filled with turmoil. He\ncouldn't believe that his power after\nbecoming stronger was so vulnerable. I'm\nsorry, Mr. Yang. It was my fault for not\nmanaging my subordinates properly.\nPlease forgive me. Mongli showed a hint\nof apology. She continued, \"Actually, I\ndidn't investigate you on purpose. It\nwas for the sake of the company's growth\nthat I have been sending people to\nsearch for the nightmare apostle in the\ncountryside. The main issue is that you\nonce committed a robbery, stealing\n50,000 yuan.\" The victim reported the\nincident, saying that he fired a gun\nduring the struggle with the robber, but\nthe robber was unharmed. It just so\nhappens that I have some connections\nwith the chief of the 13th District\nPolice Department, which is how I\nlearned about this matter and led to the\nsubsequent investigation. By the way, I\nalso helped suppress your robbery.\nAlthough you gained superhuman powers,\nyour methods were still too crude. Yong\nDona, he was somewhat embarrassed when\nhis Robin Hoodlike deeds were exposed,\nand he never expected that Murong\nMungley had secretly helped him. Murong\nMoon continued, Mr. Yang, there is\nactually another reason why I came to\nyou. What's the reason? Yong Donging\nlowered his hostility slightly. After\nall, he had received a favor from\nsomeone. Because you are kind,\" Morong\nMungly said with a smile. \"Many ordinary\npeople commit inhumane crimes after\nbecoming superhumans. But you are\ndifferent. You robbed a heartless boss\nwho often withheld workers wages, and\nyou did not kill anyone. Although I do\nnot advocate doing this, your moral\nstandards are relatively high compared\nto others.\" Yong Donging smiled\nawkwardly, seemingly a little\nembarrassed. I don't want the company's\nemployees to be wicked people who do all\nsorts of evil deeds, even if they are\nvery capable. After saying all this, Mr.\nYong, what do you think? Joining the\nbronze coffin will only benefit you. Our\nunderstanding of the nightmare world and\nthe extraordinary beings is definitely\nbetter than yours alone. All you need to\ndo is sell any and used magical\nartifacts or extraordinary materials to\nthe company first. Of course, the\ncompany won't let you lose out on the\nprice. Mongley sincerely invited,\nbelieving that Yong Donging had no\nreason to refuse. However, Yong Donging\nremained silent for a moment and finally\nshook his head. I'm sorry, Miss Morong.\nAlthough your offer is very tempting, \"I\nrefuse.\" Morong Moon&lt;unk&gt;s eyes. She was\nneither angry nor disappointed at being\nrejected, but asked with interest. \"Can\nI know the reason?\" Yang Doning\nhesitated, his mind filled with images\nof Su Mu rejecting Yiono and waving\ngoodbye to Tinking. It was this\nseemingly selfish, cold-blooded gang\nleader who stood up for him at a crucial\nmoment and even saved his life. Mr. Sue,\nI can't reason with him. You're a smart\nman. As long as we follow my plan, we\ncan definitely get back to reality. Sumu\nsmiled as usual and said, \"I refuse.\" It\nwas during this incident that Yong\nDong&lt;unk&gt;s opinion of Sumu changed. Yong\nDongqing cleared the images from his\nmind, took a deep breath, and said,\n\"Because I promised someone that I would\nwork for him for 3 years.\" Murong Moon\nwas somewhat surprised. \"That person is\nalso a nobleman.\" Yong Doning shook his\nhead. \"No, he is a gentleman with a\ntouch of madness.\" Murang Mungli smiled\nslightly. I admire men with good\nmanners. Would you be so kind as to\nintroduce me to one? A strange look\nappeared on Yong Dona&lt;unk&gt;s face. I\nthink you may have misunderstood the\nmadness. I was talking about is the\nmadness of a mad man. Morong Moonly was\nstunned. Chapter 60. A gentleman like\nJade, the headquarters of the Viper\ngang. Sumu hung up the phone with\nJasmine. An unidentified woman\napproached Yong Donging and her demeanor\nwas unlike that of an ordinary person.\nInteresting. A slight smile appeared on\nhis lips. Aside from his status as a\nsuperhum, Yong Donging was just a poor\nstudent with virtually no social\nconnections. The fact that a woman like\nYong Doning would approach him clearly\nindicated her intentions. He never\nforgot what Yong Doning had said. When\nYong Doning first experienced the\nnightmare world, a person from the upper\ncity said it. In the real world,\nsuperhumans are a bunch of cowardly\npeople who reap without sewing. They all\ngrow up by sucking the blood of\nnightmare apostles. Now, it seems like\nvampires have come knocking. Hey, you\nget ready. We're having guests coming in\na bit. Yes, Chief. Xiao Chiao replied\nrespectfully. About an hour later, a\nlow-key yet luxurious black sedan pulled\nup in front of the Viper Gang\nHeadquarters. Hanu was the one driving.\nHe glanced at the Viper Gang\nheadquarters. A look of disdain on his\nface. A gang? A superhum is actually\nemployed by a gang. Yong Donging&lt;unk&gt;s\nexpression was somewhat unpleasant. He\nsensed the other party's disdain, but he\ndidn't say anything. Clearly, the man's\nstrength had just impressed him. At this\nmoment, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Mongley's calm voice rang\nout. Han Yu, I know you were sent by my\nfather to help me, but that doesn't mean\nyou can belittle my guest at will. Hanu\nglanced at the other person's stunningly\nbeautiful face and replied\nprefuncterally, \"Okay, boss. Soon,\neveryone got off the car.\" Two Viper\ngang henchmen stepped forward, \"Welcome\nguests. The leader is waiting for you.\"\nYong Donging was taken aback. He hadn't\nexpected Su Mu to know in advance. He\ndidn't know that it was Jasmine who had\ninformed him and he had already sent\nJasmine back ahead of time. Led by a\nmember of the Viper gang, the three\narrived at a large hall deep inside the\nheadquarters. The hall was brightly lit\nand a dazzling giant crystal chandelier\nhung from the dome that was over 10 m\nhigh with tens of thousands of crystals\nrefracting brilliant light. The floor is\npaved with precious marble which is warm\nand smooth. Each stone has a unique\ntexture. The walls are decorated with\nexquisite murals with delicate brush\nstrokes and vibrant colors. In the\ncenter of the hall, a set of luxurious\nsofas is arranged in a staggered manner\nwith a wooden coffee table in the\nmiddle, its surface carved with\nintricate patterns. Mongley entered the\nhall. She couldn't help but reveal a\nhint of appreciation. She wasn't\nappreciating the luxury. She had seen\nplaces that were even more luxurious.\nWhat she appreciated was the other\nperson's taste. The entire hall, from\nits spatial layout to its decorative\ndetails, exudes an exquisite artistic\natmosphere like a frozen art palace with\neverything perfectly matched. Apart from\nthe abrupt Urao&lt;unk&gt;'s wall behind the\nsofa, Hanu curled his lip, his\nexpression disdainful, another clumsy\nimitation of the nobility. Please have a\nseat, everyone. The leader will be here\nshortly. Xiao Chiao led the group to the\nsofa, made some tea, and then left.\nAfter taking her seat, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Mungly\nasked, \"Mr. Yang, is the Mr. Suyu\nmentioned also an extraordinary person?\"\nYang Daing thought about Su Mu&lt;unk&gt;s\namazing performance and felt that he was\nno ordinary person. Although he didn't\nknow what his bronze law was, he still\naffirmed, \"Yes.\" Murang Mungly s eyes\nflickered slightly, clearly indicating\nthat she had also developed feelings for\nSumu. Before long, the door on one side\nof the hall opened, and everyone looked\nin the direction of the sound. They saw\na man wearing a black suit, brown\nglasses, and carrying a snake- patterned\nwooden cane slowly walk in. His\nappearance seemed to imbue the\nsurrounding air with an air of elegance.\nTall and upright, he walked with a\nsteady and composed gate. His high nose\nbridge and slightly upturned corners of\nhis mouth outlined a confident and\ncharming smile that was as refreshing as\na spring breeze. A strange look flashed\nin Murong Mungly s beautiful eyes. She\nrarely got moved by other people's\nappearance, but she made an exception\ntoday. As she watched the gentleman\napproach, only four words came to her\nmind. A gentleman as elegant as Jade.\nIt's not that the other person's\nappearance is perfect, but rather their\ntemperament. That clean and gentle\ntemperament, like Jade, is truly hard to\nignore. Besides her temperament, what's\nmost striking about her is her skin. She\nfound it hard to believe that a man's\nskin could be so good, so flawless. A\nhint of jealousy flashed in Han Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\neyes. He considered himself to be\ngood-looking, but compared to the\nnewcomer, he seemed to be on a\ncompletely different level. A man's\nhandsomeness lies not in his physical\nappearance, but in the confident aura\nthat emanates from within. The visitor\nwas none other than Sumu, who greeted\nthe guests with a warm smile and polite\nnods. Yong Donging was stunned. He\ncouldn't understand why Su Mu had become\neven more handsome after just one day.\nHe looked at him closely and found that\nhis appearance hadn't changed, but he\njust felt that he was more handsome,\nthough he couldn't quite put his finger\non what made him so handsome. Let me\nintroduce myself. My name is Sumu. It's\na pleasure to meet you all. Murong\nMungley withdrew her gaze and calmly\nreturned the greeting. Hello, Mr. Sue. I\nam Murong Mungley. Sumu smiled and\nnodded, his expression unchanged despite\nthe other party's noble status. This\ngave Murang Mungley the illusion that\nshe had returned to the upper city and\nwas having a meeting with a real noble.\nAfter exchanging pleasantries and\nintroductions, Murong Mungley revealed\nher purpose. Originally, I only wanted\nto invite Mr. Yang to join my company,\nbut after meeting Mr. Su, I have changed\nmy mind. Oh, I'd like to hear more. Sumu\ntook a sip of tea, his gaze gently fixed\non Murang Munglay. She was probably the\nmost beautiful woman he had ever seen in\nreality. Even in his dreams, she was\nworthy of being part of his herum. I\nwould like to invite you and Mr. Yong to\njoin us in the bronze coffin, Murong\nMungley said sincerely. She did not have\nthe arrogance of a nobleman. She only\nhad a genuine invitation. Su Mu smiled,\nnot directly refusing Murong Mungly, but\ninstead asking, \"Miss Murong, could you\ngive me a reason to join? Forgive my\nbluntness, but Mr. Su is not short of\nmoney and is also an extraordinary\nbeing, possessing the basic conditions\nto set up a company. However, in terms\nof the system of the Crimson Flame\nEmpire, without connections with nobles,\nit is difficult to complete the relevant\nprocedures, and the official management\nof private extraordinary companies is\nvery strict. As far as I know, most\nextraordinary companies, large and\nsmall, have aristocratic backgrounds to\nvarying degrees. Although I don't think\nnoble status is something to flaunt, it\ndoes indeed grant certain preferential\ntreatment and conveniences in the\nCrimson Flame Empire. Moreover, the\nBronze Coffin organization is relatively\nnew, and the two of you joining now are\nconsidered veterans, so you don't need\nto worry about benefits or compensation.\nMiss Morome, I can feel your sincere\ninvitation. But Sumu changed the\nsubject. I have a better suggestion.\nChapter 61. The country bumpkins of the\ndowntown. What suggestion? Investment. A\nlook of surprise appeared on Murong\nMungly s face. She hadn't expected Sumu\nto want to invest in shares. Good, but I\ndon't lack money. Sumu shook his head. I\ndidn't mean investing with money, but\nwith intelligence. Miss Mor, your\ncompany is just starting out, so your\nintelligence capabilities must be\nrelatively weak. Otherwise, you wouldn't\nhave only found Yong Doning now. I am\nnot particularly talented, but I am\nextremely skilled in intelligence work.\nTo put it bluntly, if I wanted to, there\nwould be no secrets in the entire\ndistrict 13. Ha. Hanu suddenly couldn't\nhelp but laugh. Morong Moonly glanced at\nhim, but he seemed not to see it and\ncontinued to laugh. Sorry, I just\ncouldn't help it. It's just that when I\nsaw those country bumpkins in the lower\ntown bragging so seriously, I just\ncouldn't hold back. Upon hearing this,\nMongley's expression changed while\nSumu's face curled into an interested\nsmile, his eyes appearing and\ndisappearing behind his brown glasses.\nThe master and servant do not seem to\nget along. Kid, you only control a\nsmall, insignificant gang, yet you dare\nto speak so arrogantly. You say there\nare no secrets in the entire 13th\ndistrict and you want to invest. Do you\nreally think you can invest in the\ncompany of an imperial nobleman with the\nintelligence network of a small gang? H\nyou apologize to Mr. Sue immediately.\nMoronly s tone became unusually stern.\nApologize, boss. You're just an ordinary\nperson. You don't understand the\nsupernatural. I've seen plenty of green\nhorns like this who have just gained\nsupernatural power. Their sudden power\nmakes them lose their minds and think\nthey're so powerful, but little do they\nknow they're just at the bottom of the\nsupernatural world. The Morong family\nhad sent me to assist you, so it is my\nduty to ensure you are not deceived.\nMongly s expression grew increasingly\ngrim. She took a deep breath and said,\n\"Mr. Sue, I'm sorry to have put you in\nsuch a difficult position.\" Sumu waved\nhis hand casually and smiled. Miss Mor,\nyou flatter me. I am not so petty as to\nget angry if a dog on the street barks\nat me. Han Yu&lt;unk&gt;s mocking laughter\nstopped abruptly. He stared straight at\nSumu, his killing intent undisguised.\nKid, say that again if you dare. Faced\nwith Han Yu&lt;unk&gt;s threat, Sumu didn't\neven glance at him. Instead, he turned\nto Murang Mly and said, \"Miss Murong, do\nyou need me to teach your subordinate a\nlesson?\" For some reason, the man's calm\nsmile in front of her inexplicably\nconvinced her. You're courting death.\nHanu roared in fury as a retainer of an\nimperial nobleman and a powerful\nsuperhuman himself. He came from the\nupper city and naturally looked down on\nthe people of the lower city. But he\nnever expected to be looked down upon by\nthe country bumpkin he despised. Whoosh!\nHe sprang up instantly, his speed\nastonishing, his fists arriving almost\nin the blink of an eye, aimed at\nSumu&lt;unk&gt;s head. \"Stop!\" Sumu Muri and\nYong Doning shouted at the same time,\nbut it was too late. Han Yu&lt;unk&gt;s fist\nslammed into Sumu&lt;unk&gt;s head, but Sumu\nseemed not to have reacted at all,\nremaining seated motionless on the sofa.\nJust when Hanu thought he had succeeded,\nsomething unexpected happened. The\nexpected sound of a head exploding did\nnot occur. Han Yu&lt;unk&gt;s fist passed\nthrough Sumu&lt;unk&gt;s body as if it were\nair. The next moment, Sumu's figure\nshattered inch by inch like a dream\nbubble. What? Hanu was shocked. At this\nmoment, a tidal wave of men in black\nsurged out from the doors on all four\nsides of the hall, instantly surrounding\neveryone. Each of them was\nexpressionless, like a group of coal\nmachines. Faced with the encirclement,\nHanu remained calm, his eyes scanning\nthe surrounding area, trying to find Su\nMu&lt;unk&gt;s whereabouts. To him, the\nencirclement by these ordinary people\nposed no threat whatsoever. What truly\nstruck him as strange was Su Mu's\nmethods. Thump, thump, thump. The sound\nof a snakeskin cane striking the ground\nrang out and everyone looked in the\ndirection of the sound to see Sumu\nwalking out from among the men in black\nwith a smile on his face. Miss Morong,\nI'm afraid today's matter cannot be\nresolved peacefully. However, for your\nsake, as long as Mr. Han Yu is willing\nto apologize, I can consider forgiving\nhis offense,\" Sumu said with a smile.\nMorung Moonly could speak, Han Yu\nscoffed, naive. \"You think these\nordinary people can do anything to me?\"\nSum Mu&lt;unk&gt;s smile widened and he said\ninunciating each word clearly who said\nthey were ordinary people. Thump. The\nsnakeskin came tapped lightly on the\nground as if signaling something and a\nstrange scene unfolded. Roar. Hundreds\nof men in black simultaneously unleashed\na violent roar. A sound that seemed to\ncome from the depths of hell filled with\nendless pain and rage. Accompanied by\nthe chilling roar. Their bodies began to\nundergo bizarre changes. Pieces of jet\nblack scales grew from beneath their\nskin at a visible speed, rapidly\nspreading across their entire bodies,\narranging themselves tightly together to\nform an indestructible armor. At their\njoints, sharp bone spurs pierced through\nthe skin, stretching out menacingly like\nthe claws of a demon. Their bodies grew\ntaller and more twisted, their muscles\nbulging, and their lines grotesque.\nTheir facial features were covered by\nblack scales, revealing only pairs of\nscarlet eyes that radiated a murderous\naura. A chilling aura of terror\npermeated the entire area. They were\nlike demons crawling out of hell,\nseemingly poised to unleash a bloody\nmassacre at any moment. This sudden and\nterrifying change caused Murang Mungley\nand Yong Doning to change their\nexpressions slightly, not to mention Han\nYu, who was being targeted. At this\nmoment, Han Yu felt a chill run down his\nspine as he was stared at by countless\npairs of scarlet eyes. What? What kind\nof monster is this? Even the noble\nretainer, who considered himself\nknowledgeable and experienced, was\nterrified. He had never encountered\nanything so bizarre and even suspected\nthat he had fallen into a nightmare\nworld. Mr. Han, I wonder, would they\nallow you to apologize? Surrounded by\nmonsters, Sumu asked politely with an\nunchanging smile on his face. Han\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s expression suddenly turned\nextremely ugly. He nervously scanned the\narea, silently assessing whether he\ncould defeat so many monsters,\nespecially since he had no idea of their\nstrength. But judging from their aura\nand those terrifying black scales, these\nmonsters seem incredibly powerful.\nSeeing that Hanu did not answer, Sumu\ncontinued, \"It seems that my\npreparations were insufficient. In that\ncase, slap, slap.\" He clapped his hands\nand countless hidden compartments\nappeared on the walls of the hall. As\nthe compartments opened, machine guns\nslowly emerged from the walls, their\ndark muzzles gleaming eerily under the\nlight. Not only that, the marble\nfloorboards at the edges of the hall\nwere also flipped up, revealing hidden\ncompartments inside where time bombs\nwere placed. Chapter 62. Mr. Sue, I was\nwrong. The bomb's outer shell was cast\nfrom cold metal, gleaming with a\nchilling light. The main body of the\nbomb was cylindrical with a small\nelectronic display screen embedded at\nits top. The red numbers flashing on the\nscreen were like a devil's countdown.\nAround the display screen were densely\npacked lines and interfaces. Upon seeing\nthis, Hanu broke out in a cold sweat. He\nsuddenly regretted offending this\ncountry bumpkin from the lower city.\nThis man appeared gentle and humble, but\nin reality, he was an extremely\ndangerous person who would be so kind as\nto plant so many bombs in their own\nhome. He had originally thought about\nwhether he could break through the\nencirclement and capture the leader\nfirst, directly seizing Sumu. But when\nhe saw the bomb, his heart sank\ncompletely. He dared not make any rash\nmoves, fearing that he might\naccidentally trigger the bomb during the\nprocess. If these hundreds of bombs were\ndetonated, the entire headquarters of\nthe Viper gang would be raised to the\nground. Even though he considered\nhimself quite capable, he wasn't\nconfident enough to withstand so many\nbombs. Yong Donging broke out in a cold\nsweat upon seeing this scene. He had\nnever imagined that Sumu had so many\nhidden tricks up his sleeve. He felt\nthat his defeat back then was not\nunjust. And even if he had won, he\nprobably wouldn't have been able to\nleave the poisonous snake gang alive. Of\nthose present, only Murang Mungley\nremained calm. Although the noble lady's\npupils contracted, she still maintained\nthe most basic decorum. She finally\nunderstood why Yong Doning had such an\nopinion of Sumu, a gentleman with a\ntouch of madness. That's definitely\ncrazy enough. \"What do you think, Mr.\nHan?\" Sumu asked politely, as if a\ngentleman were showing his collection to\na guest. A bead of cold sweat slid down\nHan Yu&lt;unk&gt;s face. His muscles were\ntense, and his eyes kept flashing. \"Stop\nbluffing! I don't believe you dare to\ndetonate a bomb. There is an Imperial\nnoble sitting here. If the crime of\nkilling an Imperial noble is confirmed,\nthe entire Crimson Flame Empire will not\ntolerate you. Sumu smiled slightly.\nYou're wrong. Miss Muron won't die. She\ncarries some kind of defensive magic\nweapon. I won't die either because this\nis just my clone. My subordinates won't\ndie either. Their scale armor provides\nsufficient defense. Only you will die.\nMuron Munley&lt;unk&gt;s expression changed\nslightly. She hadn't expected that Su Mu\nwould see through her defensive magic\nweapon. Upon hearing this, Han Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\nface froze and he pointed at Yong\nDoning, still unwilling to give up and\nasked, \"What about him? He's also your\nsubordinate. It's all right. He's dead.\nSo be it, Yong Dona.\" Although he was\nalready used to sue Moo 37\u00b0 off and\nsaying such cold words, he still felt\nvery annoyed every time he heard it. Mr.\nHan, now it's your choice. Apologize or\ndie. Han Yu&lt;unk&gt;s face grew increasingly\ngrim. His pride wouldn't allow him to\napologize to the people of the lower\ncity, but he also didn't want to die. At\nthis moment, Morung Moonly spoke up.\nHanu apologized. Her tone was cold and\ncarried an unquestionable air. I I was\nwrong. Han Yu finally lowered his noble\nhead, constantly comforting himself that\nhe had obeyed Mury as orders. And\nbesides, he didn't need to fight to the\ndeath with the country bumpkins from the\nlower city. Sumu shook his head. Not\nenough. Han Yu&lt;unk&gt;s face darkened with\nanger. What else do you want? Do you\nwant me to kneel down? A good\nsuggestion. You Han Yu&lt;unk&gt;s chest\nheaved violently, his eyes almost\nspitting fire. This extreme humiliation\nbrewing in his chest. Bite. Sumu took\nthe remote control out of his pocket and\npressed the button. The next moment, the\nbright red numbers on the time bomb\ndisplays began to flash wildly. At the\nsame time, the scaled monsters quietly\nsealed off all the exits. Holy crap.\nYong Doning panicked and immediately got\nup and ran outside. I told you he was\ncrazy, but you didn't believe me. Get\nout of the way and let me out first. I'm\none of your own.\" The scaled monster did\nnot make things difficult for Yaong\nDonging and made room for him to leave.\nHan Yu&lt;unk&gt;s heart pounded wildly. \"No,\nI can't die here. I have a bright future\nahead of me. I don't need to fight to\nthe death with these country bumpkins\nfrom the lower city.\" He kept reassuring\nhimself, unaware that his arrogance had\nalready been shattered by the fear of\ndeath. Thump. He knelt heavily on the\nground. Mr. Sue, I was wrong. Bite. Sumu\npressed the remote control again, and\nthe time bomb stopped flashing. Then all\nthe hidden compartments in the hall were\nclosed, and the scaled monsters receded\nlike the tide. Sumu returned to the sofa\nand drank tea with Murong Mungly as if\nnothing had ever happened. Miss Morong,\nwould you like to try this in sham black\ntea? I wonder if it suits your taste.\nMurang Mungli gently tucked one side of\nher hair behind her ear. Elegantly\npicked up her teacup, took a sip, and\nsavored it. Smooth and mellow with a\nlong lasting sweet aftertaste of fine\ntea. She paused for a moment and then\nadded, \"I like it very much.\" Sumu\nsmiled slightly, understanding Murang\nMungly sext. \"Miss Murong indeed has\nexcellent taste. It seems that it would\nbe a fortunate thing to be able to\ncooperate with Miss Murang.\" The elegant\nman and woman chatted and laughed,\nneither paying any attention to Hanu,\nwho was kneeling on the ground like a\nstray dog. Hanu clenched his fists\ntightly, his eyes bloodshot like spiderw\nwebs. But he didn't dare to stand up\nbecause Sumu did not let him stand up.\nHe dared not gamble with an enemy who\nalways wore a smile. He feared that if\nhe stood up, he would be targeted again\nand suffer even more humiliation. The\nbizarre ability to create clones, the\nsubordinates who are like nightmare\nmonsters, and the bombs that fill the\nentire hall. Any one of these things\nmakes Han Yu extremely wary. Mr. Su, I\nadmire your methods. I seem to have no\nreason to refuse your investment. Mong\nMoonly smiled, but this time her smile\nseemed less polite and more like that of\na friend. It's a pleasure to cooperate\nwith you. Sumu smiled and extended his\nhand. It's a pleasure to cooperate with\nyou. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Moonly smiled and extended\nher hand as well. Those hands were like\nmeticulously sculpted works of art, long\nand slender. Each finger is straight and\neven as a scallion with delicate and\nexquisite joints, and skin is white and\nsmooth as mutton fat jade. A polite\nhandshake, brief and to the point.\nAfterwards, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Mly left her address\nin a pass for the upper city area and\nthen left with Hano. Sumu sat alone on\nthe sofa, sipping tea, the business card\nbetween two fingers, bronze coffin.\nInteresting. With his keen eye, it was\nnot difficult for him to see that Han Yu\nand Murong Mungi were only superficially\nharmonious. It seemed that Hanu was\nintentionally or unintentionally going\nagainst Murang Mungly and did not want\nthe bronze coffin to grow stronger.\nHowever, out of fear of their noble\nstatus, they dared not show it too\nobviously. It seems that the Imperial\nnobles are not as supreme as I imagined.\nChapter 63. Upper District. In the\nCrimson Flame Empire, the privileges of\nnobles are almost above the law. It is\nsaid that nobles can kill a few\ncommoners at will without any\nconsequences. However, Han Yu has\nrepeatedly disobeyed Murong Mlia&lt;unk&gt;s\norders, which is quite intriguing. Just\nas Sumu was pondering, there was a\nknock. Yong Donging came running back\nagain. Why didn't it explode? He walked\nto the sofa, picked up a teacup, and\ndrank it all in one gulp. I always\nthought that with your level of madness,\nyou were bound to blow it up. Yang\nDoning, it seems you have a deep\nmisunderstanding of me. I have always\nadvocated resolving disputes peacefully.\nFine, I didn't misunderstand you at all.\nYang Donging curled his lip. What\npeace-loving person would fill their own\nhouse with bombs? By the way, why did\nthe Viper gang members suddenly turn\ninto monsters? How many abilities do you\nactually have? Sumu smiled without\nsaying a word, offering no explanation.\nOnly he himself knew the real reason.\nThere were no monsters, no machine guns,\nand no bombs at all. Everything was the\nmyriad phenomena of the universe. Sunluo\nsignifies numerousness and enumeration\nwhile Wiiang refers to all things and\nscenes in the universe. Together they\nrepresent the diverse and abundant\nphenomena and forms in the universe. It\nimplies encompassing everything and\nhaving everything. This is the power of\nall things in the universe which in\nlayman's terms is illusionary\nmanipulation of vision. all things in\nthe world can manipulate vision and\nconsume mental energy to conjure up all\nthe scenes in the world. So, the Viper\ngangs henchmen turning into monsters and\nthe bombs were all fake illusions. As\nfor how he knew that Murley possessed a\ndefensive treasure, it's simple. He had\npreviously tried to hypnotize her, but\nhis mental power was blocked by some\nkind of invisible barrier.\nThe following night in the upper city\narea, Sumu and Yong Donging finally\narrived at the outskirts of the upper\ncity. The 13th district was far from the\nupper city, and it took them several\nhours to get there. The two stood\nbeneath the massive city wall, watching\nthe endless stream of people flowing\nthrough the city gate. The tall and\nmajestic city wall, like a sleeping\ndragon, meanders along the edge of the\ncity, clearly separating the upper and\nlower urban areas from the outside\nworld, just like the Chu River and\nHanborder. At the massive city gate, a\nsquad of heavily armed soldiers was\nchecking passers by. People from the\nlower city were not allowed to enter\nwithout a pass. Sumu and Yong Donging\nfollowed the crowd. When they reached\nthe soldier, Sumu calmly took out the\npass left by Morong Mlay. When the\nsoldier saw the seal representing\nnobility on the pass, he was immediately\nshocked and stood at attention to\nsalute. Sumu smiled and nodded at him,\nthen entered the upper city area. The\nmoment he entered the upper city, he\nfelt as if he had entered another world.\nBefore your eyes stand towering\nskyscrapers that seemed to reach into\nthe clouds like steel jungles, their\nglass curtain walls reflecting colorful\nyet cold light. Countless neon signs\nflash wildly, cutting the dark night sky\ninto countless fragmented blocks of\ncolor. The giant screen scrolled through\nflamboyant advertisements, and the\npedestrians were dressed in bright and\nfashionable clothes. The neon street\nlights on both sides of the road emitted\na light that resembled an ocean\nengulfing every street. The red, blue,\nand purple lights intertwined, forming a\ndreamlike vortex of colors, luxurious\nand extravagant. This was Sumu's first\nimpression of the upper city district.\nHowever, he was already used to such\nscenes in his dreams. He had even\ncreated a fairy land in his dreams,\nwhich was far beyond what the upper city\ndistrict could compare to. In contrast\nto his composure, Yong Donging was like\na country bumpkin visiting the city,\ncompletely dumbfounded, staring at every\nsight without blinking. He had long\nheard that the upper district was\nprosperous. But he never expected it to\nbe this prosperous. This reminded him of\ndistrict 13, where the sky was always\ngray, factories were everywhere, gangs\nroamed, and even the streets were\ndilapidated. Suddenly, he clenched his\nfists because he knew that the reason\nwhy the upper district was so prosperous\nwas entirely due to sucking the blood of\nthe lower district. As someone from the\nlower city, he could feel the injustice\nmost directly. As the two strolled\nthrough the streets of Shanqing\ndistrict, Yong Doning soon noticed\nsomething a miss. Most of the\npedestrians on the roadside were\nfocusing their attention on him and\nSumu. Pastors by looked at Su Mu with\namazement and awe, as if they were\nlooking at a nobleman, but when it came\nto themselves, they were surprised and\neven contemptuous. Yong Dongqing turned\nto look at Sumu and found that the other\nman was dressed in a well-tailored,\nexpensive black suit, holding a golden\nlaid snakeskin cane, walking leisurely\nand calmly, and every move he made\nrevealed the elegance of a nobleman.\nLooking at myself, I was wearing a\nslightly yellowed white t-shirt, ripped\njeans, and bulky sneakers. I also walked\nwith my toes pointing outwards, making\nme seem out of place in the Shaning\ndistrict. Damn it. Yong Donging made up\nher mind to buy a new set of clothes in\nthe upper district before going back. He\nwas annoyed by the stairs of passers by,\nbut he couldn't do anything about it, so\nhe just kept walking with his head down.\nSuddenly, he noticed a disheveled and\nunckempt beggar begging at a street\ncorner. \"This upper district isn't all\nthat great, is it? There are still\nbeggars here.\" Yong Donging curled his\nlip in a disdainful manner. Sumu gave\nhim a half smile, clearly seeing through\nhis thoughts, but didn't say anything.\nYong Donging was annoyed by Sumu&lt;unk&gt;s\ngaze, but he was not good with words, so\nhe could only turn around and walk\ntowards the beggar, taking out a one\nyuan coin from his pocket. \"The people\nin the upper district are so rich, yet\nthey are so indifferent,\" he muttered,\ndirecting his criticism at the character\nof the upper district residents and\nintending to give arms to the beggar.\nWhen he reached the beggar, he simply\ntossed a dollar into the beggar's bowl\nand then turned to leave. The beggar was\ntaken aback, then suddenly said, \"Wait a\nminute.\" Yong Donging turned around and\nsaid coldly, \"No need to thank me.\" The\nbeggar looked him up and down, a hint of\ndisdain in his eyes. \"From the lower\ncity?\" Yong Doning frowned, \"What's\nwrong?\" The beggar took a dollar from\nthe bowl and threw it over with a look\nof disgust. Go away. People from the\nlower city have no right to give me\narms. No matter how badly I'm doing,\neven if I'm begging in the upper city, I\ndon't need your arms. Who do you think\nyou are? Yong Donging was furious. He\nhad never suffered such humiliation as\nto be looked down upon by a beggar. Damn\nit. Even beggars in the upper city were\nconsidered superior to people in the\nlower city. Just as he was about to\nconfront the beggar, a snakes-kinned\ncane blocked his way. Sumu slowly walked\nover and said to the beggar, \"I asked\nhim to give me the arms.\" The beggar was\nvery good at judging people. The moment\nhe saw Sumu, his expression changed\ndrastically, becoming extremely\nobsequious. He kept cowtowing and\nthanking him, saying, \"Thank you for\nyour reward, sir. Thank you for your\nreward, sir.\" Chapter 64. The origin of\nextraordinary beings. Yong Doning was\nfurious at his arrogant attitude,\nfollowed by his obsequious manner.\n\"Let's go. Don't cause any more\ntrouble,\" Sumu said calmly, then left\nwith Yong Doning. The two hailed a taxi\nand following the address given by\nMurang Mungley arrived at an office\nbuilding coffin company limited hanging\nat the entrance. The two entered the\ncompany and were quickly greeted by\nreceptionists. Who are you two looking\nfor? I'm looking for your chairman, Sumu\nsaid with a smile. Upon hearing this,\nthe receptionist became even more\nrespectful. Are you Mr. Su and Mr. Yang?\nExactly. The chairman is on the top\nfloor. Please come with me. As the\nelevator started moving, the two quickly\nmet Murungi in the chairman's office on\nthe top floor. But this time, Han Yu was\nnot with her. \"Mr. Su, Mr. Yang, I have\nbeen waiting for you for a long time,\"\n[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Mungly said, rising from her\noffice chair to greet them. \"It's nice\nto meet you again, Miss Morong.\" Sumu\ngreeted politely. Yong Donging also\nwhispered from the side, \"Hello.\" He\nseemed a little uncomfortable. It was\nthe first time he had ever experienced\nsuch a scene, having just arrived in\nShanqing district and meeting the\nchairman of a large company. In\nparticular, the chairperson is\nexceptionally beautiful and charming.\nToday, Murong Moonly wore a white\nwomen's suit with an exquisite silk\nscarf tied at the collar, exuding\nelegance in its simplicity. Her delicate\nface was adorned with light makeup, her\nfair skin glowing with a faint blush.\nHer long flax and hair was casually\ndraped over her shoulders, adding to her\ncharm and mature allure. Yong Donging\nonly saw beauty. But Sumu saw something\nelse different. Murong Moon was not old,\nonly in her early 20s, and she was\nobviously using her appearance to make\nherself look more mature and composed\nand to enhance her prestige. Logically\nspeaking, as a noble woman, she did not\nneed to do this because her noble status\nwas enough to support everything.\nConsidering Han Yu&lt;unk&gt;s previous\nattitude, he guessed that Murong Mungi\nas a noble woman probably did not have a\nhigh status in her family. After\nexchanging pleasantries, Murong Mungley\ngot down to business, handing a document\nto Sumu. Mr. Sue, this is the\nshareholding agreement. Please take a\nlook. Sumu flipped through the\ndocuments. Having studied imperial law\nin his dream, he didn't need a lawyer to\nread the contract. After confirming that\nthere were no problems with the\ncontract, he readily signed it. Mr. Sue,\nyou are a smart man. You must have\nguessed from Han Yu&lt;unk&gt;s attitude\nyesterday that my status in the family\nis not high. Morong Moonly said calmly.\nFacing her partner, she did not use her\nnoble status to seek benefits for\nherself, but chose to get straight to\nthe point. Sumu nodded. I admire Miss\nMurong&lt;unk&gt;s frankness. I believe that\ntreating each other with sincerity is\nthe foundation of cooperation. Murang\nMli s gaze was firm and confident.\nBesides, I don't think that success can\nonly rely on family. That's true. Sumu\nhad to admit that this woman was very\nclever. Because of Han Yu&lt;unk&gt;s matter,\nher low status had already been exposed.\nInstead of hiding it, she took the\ninitiative to be honest. Although this\nwould lose some of the aristocratic\nauthority, it would at least make people\nfeel her sincerity. Thank you for your\nunderstanding. I will now briefly\nexplain the bronze coffin company's\ncurrent top priority, finding the golden\neye. The golden eye. Young Doning was\nsomewhat unfamiliar with this term. The\ngolden eye is the main material for\nmaking gold-grade extraordinary potions.\nTo be honest, the original purpose of\nthe bronze coffin was to create the\ngolden eye. Actually, this is no secret\nwithin the star city's supernatural\ncircle. You two from the lower city\nmight not know this, but my father, the\nhead of the Mong family, has been\nsearching for the golden eye for many\nyears. He not only offered a large\nreward, but also encouraged his children\nto create a company and recruit\nnightmare apostles to search for it.\nYong Dongqing was taken aback. Does that\nmean the golden eye only exists in the\nnightmare world? Morong Mly nodded.\nThat's right. In fact, not only the\nGolden Eye, but many extraordinary\nmaterials exist in the nightmare world.\nThis is also the original intention of\nthe Extraordinary Company, which is to\ncollect extraordinary materials through\nthe nightmare apostles. What's the use\nof collecting extraordinary materials?\nTo create extraordinary potions. Mongli\nsaid quietly. Mr. Yong, do you know how\nthose extraordinary individuals who are\nnot nightmare apostles came to be? Yong\nDonging wasn't stupid. He immediately\nrealized the obvious clue. Could it be\nusing a supernatural potion? That's\nright. In the beginning, there were no\nsuperhumans in the real world, only\nnightmare apostles. Among these\nnightmare apostles, those with\nextraordinary talents were able to\nconnect to the bronze law and awaken\nextraordinary powers. These people were\ncalled the chosen ones. Yong Dongqing\nraised his eyebrows slightly. Perhaps\nthe words chosen one had touched a nerve\nwith him. Later, the chosen ones\ncontinued to explore the nightmare world\nand discovered extraordinary materials.\nThese materials, after special\nformulation and refining, could be used\nto make extraordinary potions. Ordinary\npeople in the real world could become\nextraordinary by drinking these\nextraordinary potions. This is the\norigin of extraordinary people in the\nreal world. So, it was the nightmare\napostles that created the extraordinary\nbeings in reality. Yong Donging suddenly\nrealized that's right. Murung Mungly\nnodded. In the real world, people cannot\nconnect to the bronze law on their own.\nAccording to some highle superhumans,\nthere must be some kind of barrier in\nthe real world that is blocking humans.\nIn order to connect, we can only rely on\nexternal forces such as superhuman\npotions to break through the barrier.\nThe materials needed to obtain the\nextraordinary potion can only be\nobtained from nightmare apostles. Of\ncourse, sometimes nightmare monsters\nwill invade reality, and you can take\nthe opportunity to collect extraordinary\nmaterials from them, but this method is\ndefinitely not as efficient as using\nnightmare apostles. To put it bluntly,\nin the eyes of the nobles, nightmare\napostles are a valuable resource capable\nof helping them obtain extraordinary\nmaterials. Yong Dona&lt;unk&gt;s expression\nwas rather unpleasant. No wonder that\nnightmare apostle from the upper city\nsaid those kinds of things back then.\nPeople like nightmare apostles are\nlikely to encounter danger in any world.\nHe could almost picture some\ninscrupulous nobles kidnapping the\nfamilies of nightmare apostles for their\nown gain, then threatening the nightmare\napostles to continuously help them\nobtain extraordinary materials until\nthey died in the nightmare world.\nAlthough the first superhumans were\nnightmare apostles, due to their special\nnature, they rarely live long lives. As\nfar as I know, no nightmare apostle has\nbeen able to completely escape the\nnightmare world. Real world superhumans\nposed no such threat. So, in the end,\nreal world superhumans grew increasingly\npowerful while the nightmare apostles\nfluctuated constantly. Chapter 65\nclassification. Morong Mungly paused for\na moment, then continued, \"I can\nunderstand your concerns as nightmare\napostles, but please rest assured that\nwhat you are worried about will not\nhappen in the bronze coffin. In fact,\nthe cooperation between superhumans in\nthe real world and nightmare apostles\nhas developed into a relatively stable\nmodel over the years. In the beginning,\nit was indeed quite chaotic, and\nsuperhumans in the real world often\nthreatened Nightmare apostles. However,\npeople underestimated the danger of the\nnightmare apostle. A person who could\ndie in the nightmare world at any time\ncould unleash a ruthlessness far beyond\nthat of ordinary people when faced with\nthreats. There were even instances of\nnightmare apostles using suicide attacks\nto kill imperial nobles, leading to a\ngradual shift in relations between the\ntwo sides towards cooperation,\neventually giving rise to the\nextraordinary corporation. Sumu smiled\nnon-committally. He understood human\nnature very well. In the eyes of nobles,\nnightmare apostles were employees who\ncould die at any time, but had extremely\nhigh value. Perhaps after paying the\nnightmare apostle today, the person\nwould die in the nightmare world\ntomorrow. Then the nobles would\ndefinitely think, \"If I just make a\nverbal promise and then wait for the\nnightmare apostle to die, wouldn't I\nsave a lot of money?\" Even more ruthless\nnobles can directly threaten the\nnightmare apostles family without\nspending a single penny. What can the\nnightmare apostle do, no matter how\ncrazy he is? In the end, this world is\nall about strength. Would someone as\nextraordinary as Hanu be afraid of Yong\nDona&lt;unk&gt;s threats? Miss Mororrow, I\nrecently became a superhum. I would like\nto know where my strength ranks among\nsuperhumans, or rather the hierarchy\namong superhumans. Yang Doning asked the\nquestion he cared about most. His utter\nhelplessness in the face of Han Yu last\ntime had cast a shadow over his heart.\nAll superhumans in the real world were\nlike this. Then he would have to\nconsider keeping a low profile from now\non. Mongley nodded. Mr. Yang, you\ncurrently only possess the bronze law of\niron will, right? Yang Donging was taken\naback. I do only possess iron will, Miss\nMorrow. From what you're saying, could\nit be that you also possess multiple\nbronze laws? Yes, the abilities\npossessed by extraordinary individuals\nare not singular. Mr. Yang, haven't you\never considered why the bronze law is\ncalled bronze? Yong Donging seemed to\nhave thought of something, and his eyes\nwidened involuntarily. Could there be a\nsilver law, a golden law? [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Lingly\ntucked a few stray strands of hair\nbehind her ear and said with a faint\nsmile, \"Mr. Yong really understands\nthings quickly. There are three kinds of\nlaws in this world. Bronze, silver, and\ngold. Possessing a bronze law is\nconsidered a formal entry into the ranks\nof the extraordinary with a rank of\nbronze rank one. Possessing two bronze\nlaws constitutes bronze tier 2. Yong\nDonging involuntarily opened his mouth\nwide. If there are 10 bronze laws,\nwouldn't that be bronze level 10? Murong\nMungly smiled gently like a flower\nblooming in spring, radiant and\ncharming. Only at times like this did\nshe seem to shed some of her strong\nwoman persona and reveal a touch of\ngirish innocence. There aren't that\nmany. The highest is only bronze tier\nthree. Above tier three is silver. And\nonce you reach silver tier three, you\nnaturally become a gold expert. My\nfather is a silver tier three\nextraordinary being. He's been stuck at\nthis level for a long time and has\ncollected a lot of extraordinary\nmaterials. Right now, he only needs the\ngolden eye to advance to gold. Call Yong\nDonging breathed a sigh of relief. He\nhad almost thought that he was worlds\napart from the extraordinary beings in\nthe real world. It turned out that each\nlevel only had three stages. Then, Hanu\nis second order. Yong Doning&lt;unk&gt;s\nexpression shifted. Silver Morong Muni\nshook her head. Bronze tier 2. What?\nYong Donging&lt;unk&gt;s expression changed\ndrastically. He did not expect that Han\nYu was only one level higher than him.\nWhen they met that day, the other party\nhad suppressed him so much that he could\nnot move with just one hand. Han\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s two abilities are Megga Force\nfist and unending recovery. The former\nprovides him with unimaginable strength,\nwhile the latter gives him recovery\nability that is hundreds or thousands of\ntimes greater than that of ordinary\npeople. It can be said that unless he is\nshattered to pieces, he is very\ndifficult to kill. A sense of defeat\nwelled up in Yong Doning&lt;unk&gt;s heart. He\nrealized that the other party's two\nabilities were no weaker than his own\niron will and in some aspects they were\neven better. Before becoming a\nsuperhuman, he was always self-conscious\nand withdrawn. Later, superhuman power\ngave him unparalleled confidence. But\nnow, after coming into contact with the\nsuperhuman world, he suddenly realized\nthat he was still at the bottom and his\nself-confidence was severely shaken.\nMurang Munglay seemed to notice Yong\nDonging&lt;unk&gt;s low spirits and comforted\nhim. Mr. Yang, don't be discouraged. You\nare the chosen one, possessing innate\nadvantages that ordinary extraordinary\nindividuals cannot match. What\nadvantages? Yong Donaing asked\nexpectantly. The chosen one's talents\nare unparalleled. Under normal\ncircumstances, after an ordinary person\ntakes a supernatural potion and becomes\na bronze tier one supernatural being\nthrough continuous training and combat,\nit takes about a year to develop their\nabilities to their peak. At this point,\nthey can take a second supernatural\npotion and advance to bronze tier 2. The\nchosen ones do not need to take any\nextraordinary potions, and it only takes\n3 months to go from bronze eye to bronze\n2. Some exceptionally talented chosen\nones can even complete the process in\nless time. This isn't the chosen one's\ngreatest advantage. Their greatest\nadvantage is that all advancements don't\nrequire extraordinary potions. They can\nadvance simply by connecting to the\nbronze laws autonomously within the\nnightmare world. Of course, consuming\nextraordinary potions would certainly\nsave even more time. Yong Dongqing\nraised an eyebrow, regaining some\nconfidence. What are the manifestations\nof developing one's abilities to their\npeak? Only those with extraordinary\nabilities can truly understand this.\nIt's like breaking through some kind of\nbarrier, suddenly becoming more adept at\nusing their powers and experiencing a\nsurge in strength. Upon hearing this,\nYong Dona smile became even more\nuncontrollable than AK's. He was now\nabsolutely certain that he was a genius\namong geniuses because in the previous\nnightmare world, his iron will was\nenhanced, clearly reaching its peak, and\nhe will soon advance to bronze, too.\nSumu saw all of Yong Dona&lt;unk&gt;s\npsychological changes and couldn't help\nbut shake his head slightly. He was\nstill too young. Everything was written\non his face. Morong Munley suddenly\nturned to Sumu and asked, \"Mr. Sue,\ncould you please tell me your level? If\nit's inconvenient, it's inconvenient.\"\nSumu smiled politely. The main reason\nwas that he didn't know what level he\nwas in the bronze realm, one or two.\nImmaculate Heart plus all things in the\nuniverse seemed to be level two, but he\nhadn't developed either of these\nabilities to their peak, which didn't\nmake sense in terms of advancement\nlogic. Morly, she paused for a moment,\nthen regained her composure. Mr. Sue is\nindeed a man of few words. I was being\npresumptuous. I don't know how much Mr.\nSu knows about the extraordinary, but I\nstill have a piece of advice to give\nyou. Chapter 66. The strongest sequence.\nForesight. I'm all ears. Murang Mungllay\nsaid solemnly, \"Only after possessing\nthree different bronze laws can one\nadvance to silver.\" However, if these\nthree bronze laws are not systematic or\neven conflict with each other, one will\nnever be able to advance to silver. Take\nMr. Yong as an example. Iron Heart is a\nrelatively common bronze law. The path\nto its advancement is already clear.\nMighty Fist plus Unending Recovery.\nThere is no order to these three. Once\nyou have them all, you will have a\nchance to advance to the silver law\npower servant. However, if Mr. Yang were\nto ingest other extraordinary potions\nalong the way, such as the five fingers\nflame bullet, he would be forever unable\nto advance to the silver rank because he\nwould have taken the wrong path. Yong\nDoning&lt;unk&gt;s expression immediately\nturned strange. Being young and full of\nyouthful vigor, his thoughts were always\nprone to making those connections. Iron\nwool plus mighty fist plus unending\nrecovery equals power servant. Isn't\nthis the three essentials of a real man?\nHard, huge, and long-lasting. Then how\ndo we advance to the gold rank? Yong\nDonaing asked impatiently. Unexpectedly,\nMorong Mly shook her head. Every\nextraordinary path is a secret, and the\ngolden law is an even greater secret.\nAlthough I am a nobleman, I am still an\nordinary person, and I do not know\nanything about the subsequent\nadvancement. Most extraordinary pathways\nare controlled by the top nobles.\nCurrently, the only publicly known\npathway is the silver laws power servant\npathway because the nobles consider this\nthe most common and they need\nextraordinary individuals to emerge from\namong the ordinary people to handle the\nendless nightmare invasions. Yong\nDonging&lt;unk&gt;s hard one confidence\ndeflated again. What does most ordinary\nmean? To put it bluntly, isn't it just\nweakest? Damn it. At this moment, Morong\nMly got up and took out two paper\ndocuments from the safe, handing them to\nSu Mu and Yong Doning, respectively.\nThere's a lot of information about\nsuperhumans, so I won't go into detail.\nMost of the information is here, and you\ntwo can look at it yourselves. If you\nhave any questions, feel free to ask me.\nIt's getting late, so I've arranged\nguest rooms for you two at the company.\nA staff member will take you there\nshortly. The Bronze Coffin Company,\nSumu, sat alone on the edge of the bed,\nflipping through extraordinary\ndocuments. It contains information on\nthe origins of extraordinary beings, the\norigins of the nightmare world, the\nclassification of extraordinary levels,\nintroductions to extraordinary potions\nand rankings of the bronze law and\nsilver law. He had already learned about\nthe origins and rankings of\nextraordinary beings from Murang\nLingley. So, he simply flipped through a\nfew pages and skipped over them. What he\nwas really interested in was the origins\nof the nightmare world. How could he not\npay attention to a thrilling amusement\npark? When you open it, you'll find only\none page with a lot of time points,\nhistorical events, and many speculations\nabout the origin of the nightmare world.\nThere are many different opinions, and\nno one is accurate. The only thing we\nknow is that the nightmare world has\nexisted since ancient times, though the\nexact time is unknown. It once\nthreatened human life until the\nemergence of gold level powerhouses,\nwhich reversed the decline. The\ndescendants of these gold- level\npowerhouses are known as nobles. The\norigin of nobility is the gold warriors.\nThat means the nobles of the current\nempire are all descendants of the gold\nwarriors. Sumu muttered to himself, not\nfinding it strange. Even the gold ranked\npowerhouses at the top of the superhuman\nrealm are still human since they saved\nthe world and control power and\nauthority. They would certainly treat\ntheir descendants well, and thus the\nnobility came into being. Sumu flipped\nthrough a few more pages, his gaze\nfinally settling on the ranking of laws.\nThe above records the ranking of the\nlaws currently known to mankind,\nincluding only the bronze law and the\nsilver law. The golden law has clearly\nbeen hidden. He guessed that these\nrankings must be incomplete. The nobles\nwere only willing to reveal one path to\nthe extraordinary, which shows how\nstrict they were in keeping the secret\nof extraordinary knowledge. If the\nentire ranking of laws were released,\nsome clever people would inevitably be\nable to find the path to the\nextraordinary from it, which would be\ndetrimental to maintaining the rule of\nthe nobles. As he expected, there were\nmany gaps in the rankings. He first\nbrowsed through the entire list, but he\ncouldn't find either all things under\nheaven or the immaculate heart. I did\nsee Yong Doning&lt;unk&gt;s Iron Heart,\nsequence 9, Unending Recovery, sequence\n8, Mighty Fist, sequence 10. It looks\nvery high even in the top 10. But it's\nactually near the bottom because the\nrankings are in reverse order and the\nlarger the sequence number, the higher\nthe ranking. This is quite normal. After\nall, humans discover more and more laws\nlittle by little. If a strong law is\ndiscovered and ranked first, then an\neven stronger one will appear tomorrow,\ncausing the ranking to keep changing.\nSo, the ranking is in reverse order. The\ndata indicates that the ranking is not\nonly based on the strength of the\nability, but also on a comprehensive\nranking of factors such as rarity, value\nof the ability, and scope of influence.\nSumu lowered his gaze and looked\ndirectly at the strongest known bronze\nsequence. Bronze law sequence 241\nforesight allows for a certain degree of\nforesight into future events strongly\nrelated to oneself. Theoretically, this\nability can kill even goldranked\nindividuals. Upon seeing the note in\nparenthesis, Summu smiled slightly. He\nnaturally understood the meaning of the\nsentence. Predicting the future may seem\nto have no combat power, but in reality,\nif handled properly, it can exert an\neffect far exceeding any bronze law. For\nexample, a prophet with the ability to\nforesee the future might know in advance\nthat he will be killed by a gold level\nexpert 10 years from now. But right now,\nthis gold level expert is just an\nordinary person. So he only needs to\nkill this ordinary person to resolve the\ncrisis, which is equivalent to killing a\ngold level expert. His gaze continued\ndownwards, finding only blank spaces\nuntil sequence 233, where text appeared.\nBronze lost sequence 233, death and\nrebirth. Time reversal within one's own\nrange, capable of reversing the timeline\nof one's own death and returning to the\ntime before death. Sumu's eyes flickered\nslightly. It was another time-based\nability. Although it still didn't have\nany obvious combat power, its rarity and\nvalue far exceeded ordinary combat\nabilities. He just didn't know if it\ncould be activated continuously. If it\ncould, it would definitely be a true\nimmortal body. Bronze law sequence 21\nboundless flashing allows for continuous\nspatial displacement. He looked through\nthem carefully and found that the top\nranked abilities were mostly time and\nspace related, which were indeed\npowerful. Then he opened the silver law\nrankings. Chapter 67. The shadow is not\nwhite. Silver law sequence 121. Flower\nblooms in an instant at the cost of\nlifespan. Alter one's own timeline,\nputting oneself in a state of time\nacceleration. Another time-based attack,\nbut this time it's different from\nbefore. Clearly possessing terrifying\ncombat power. Although the description\nis simple, a little thought will reveal\nthe terrifying nature of flowers bloom\nin an instant. If you could accelerate\nyour own time by 100 times, wouldn't\nthat be equivalent to being 100 times\nfaster? This isn't just about speed. It\nmeans that any action would become\nfaster. For example, a set of actions\nthat used to take an hour, such as\neating, drinking, using the toilet, or\ntaking a shower could be completed in a\nsecond after time acceleration. If the\nuser is already fast, it would be\ninvincible and could even achieve a\nsimilar effect of time relatively\nstanding still. Seeing this, Sumu\ncouldn't help but wonder, \"How could\nsuch a powerful ability only be silver?\nJust how terrifying must a gold level\nexpert be?\" With a rustling sound, the\npages turned, and his gaze fell upon the\nlast page. Extraordinary forbidden one.\nIt is forbidden to disclose any\ninformation about the nightmare world to\nordinary people. Violators will be\nhunted down by the empire. Note,\nnightmares have the ability to spread\nthrough cognition. That is the more\npeople who know about nightmares, the\neasier it is for nightmares to invade\nreality. Similarly, ordinary people who\nknow about the existence of the\nnightmare world are more likely to enter\nthe nightmare world than those who do\nnot know about it. This is easy to\nunderstand. After all, what you think\nabout during the day, you dream about at\nnight. It's hard for a person to dream\nabout something they've never\nencountered before. Once they have\ninformation about the nightmare world in\ntheir mind, the possibility of dreaming\nabout it increases. Two, the law is\ncontained within the mind with a maximum\nlimit of three. Exceeding this limit\nwill trigger extraordinary conflicts and\ncause mental breakdown. Three, using the\nwrong path to transcendence will prevent\nyou from advancing, and forcing yourself\nto advance will cause mental breakdown.\nMental breakdown. For some reason, Sumu\nfelt an urge to try it out whenever he\nsaw this word. He even wondered if he\ncould use this method to curb the\ninfinitely growing mental power. This\nworld is getting more and more\ninteresting. He closed the file, a deep\nsmile hidden behind his brown tinted\nglasses. It wasn't for nothing that I\nwent through all that trouble to\nsurvive. He then took off his brown\nglasses and placed them on the bedside\ntable and took off his coat to prepare\nfor sleep. A soft thud came from the\nnext room as a door opened, followed by\nheavy footsteps that clearly belonged to\nYong Doning. Thump, thump, thump. Yong\nDoning quietly made his way downstairs.\nThey probably went to experience the\nglitz and glamour of the upper district.\nSumu ignored him and went to sleep\npeacefully. Drip, drip, drip. Time\nticked by and the only sound in the room\nwas the ticking of the clock on the\nwall. Moonlight streamed through the\ncurtains, casting a hazy glow on Sum Mu\nas he lay in bed, his shadow cast on the\ncold floor. Suddenly, his shadow moved.\nThe shadows arms slowly stretched out,\ncontinuously extending, transforming\ninto two large hands like withered tree\nbranches. Gradually, the shadow surged\nand eventually stood up from the ground,\ntransforming into a tall humanoid black\nshadow whose head almost touched the\nceiling. Whoosh! At the head of the\nshadowy figure, a pair of scarlet eyes\nopened, their cold gaze fixed on Sumu,\nwho was sleeping on the bed. The scene\nwas absolutely horrifying. No one could\naccept that after they fell asleep,\ntheir shadow suddenly stood up and\nturned into a tall monster looking at\nthem from the bedside. \"Good friend, we\nmeet again.\" Sumu opened his eyes at\nsome point, his deep eyes radiating a\nbright blue light as if reflecting the\nsky within them, appearing magnificent\nunder the moonlight. He looked at the\nshadowy figure with a smile and greeted\nhim familiarly. The shadowy figure\nremained unmoved, staring intently at\nhim. Sumu had been pondering a question.\nThe shadowy figure was clearly not the\nmonster in Tinking&lt;unk&gt;s nightmare, but\nmerely parasetizing Tinking. However,\nwhen the nightmare was destroyed, the\nshadowy figure did not stop it like the\nvillagers did, allowing the nightmare to\nshatter. This doesn't fit the shadowy\nfigure's behavior pattern, and now the\ncase is finally solved. It turned out\nthat the shadow had been hiding in his\nown shadow all along and had followed\nhim into the real world. This is normal.\nAfter all, he was one of only two people\nto survive the shadow. With Tinking\ngone, the shadow would naturally choose\nhim. Hungry, Sumu suddenly asked. He had\njust sensed a mental fluctuation coming\nfrom the shadowy figure, like a pet\nasking its owner for food. He smiled\nslightly. No wonder you couldn't resist\ncoming out now. You were hungry. I'm\njust curious what you eat, people. The\nshadowy figure emitted another wave of\nmental energy, and Sumu suddenly\nrealized, \"You feed on people's spirits.\nHaha. Then you've made the right choice\nin following me.\" The shadowy figure\ndragged all the villagers of Xiao family\nvillage into darkness, turning them into\nmonsters like walking corpses. Clearly,\nit didn't eat people, but only spirits.\nAnd coincidentally, spirits were exactly\nwhat Sumu had in abundance. Then, an\nextremely pure spiritual energy surged\ninto the shadowy body, and the shadowy\nbody began to chew silently. As his\nmental energy was being constantly\ndepleted, Sumu's eyes grew brighter.\nAfter becoming a superhuman, he was\nworried about how to use up his\noverflowing mental energy everyday. He\nnever expected that his sleepiness would\nbe so easily relieved. Hypnotizing Xiao\nXiao Yao and other ordinary people no\nlonger consumes much of their mental\nenergy. As a nightmare monster capable\nof devouring an entire village, the\nstrength of the shadowy figure is\nself-evident. Sumu kept pouring in his\nmental energy, trying to see where the\nshadows limit was. But the shadow\nstopped eating after he had only poured\nin half of it. \"You're full already, my\nfriend. You don't have much of an\nappetite either.\" He sighed and shook\nhis head, complaining about his lack of\nappetite. Looking back now, the shadowy\nfigure probably didn't consume all the\nspiritual energy of the hundreds of\npeople in Xiao family village at once,\nbut rather it gradually eroded it. Well,\nit's better than nothing. At least it\ntakes more mental energy than\nhypnotizing the Viper gang. After eating\nand drinking to their heart's content,\nthe shadow melted away like water,\nturning back into a shadow and\ndisappearing without a trace, as if it\nwere all an illusion. However, Sumu\nfound that the connection between\nhimself and the shadowy figure had\nbecome closer, probably because it had\nconsumed his spiritual power. Moreover,\nhe felt that the shadowy figure seemed\nto have grown a little taller. Since\nyou've chosen to follow me, let me give\nyou a name. Let me think about it. He\nstroked his chin carefully considering\nthe features of the shadowy figure. Its\nmost prominent feature is black. So,\nlet's give it a name that doesn't\ncontain the word black, but still makes\nit instantly recognizable as black. So,\nyour name is Bubai, right? Chapter 68.\nYou have disappointed me. The following\nday, Sumu took office as the head of the\nintelligence department of the Bronze\nCoffin Company. In charge of the\nintelligence department, he also met the\nofficial employees of the Bronze Coffin\nCompany. a total of 10 people besides\nhimself and Yong Doning. It's worth\nmentioning that although these 10 people\nare all nightmare apostles, they are\nalso ordinary people. The bronze coffin\nhas three underground levels forming a\nspacious underground base. Above it is\nthe bronze coffin's office building used\nto house ordinary employees who handle\ndaily affairs. The underground is the\ncore where the nightmare apostles\ngather. Minister Sue, these 10 are all\nthe nightmare apostles currently in the\nbronze coffin. There were some before,\nbut they have all perished in the\nnightmare world. Morong Mungly\nintroduced. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr.\nSumu is the newly appointed head of the\nintelligence department of the bronze\ncoffin, and he is also a powerful\nsuperhuman. Mr. Yong Donging, who is\nstanding next to him, is also a\nsuperhuman. Sumu leaned on his snake\npatterned wooden cane, calmly observing\nthe 10 nightmare apostles before him.\nSeven men and three women dressed in\ndifferent clothes. Some bright and\nshiny, others plain and ordinary. The\nonly thing they had in common was the\nunease and panic between their brows.\nThis is how a normal person should react\nwhen experiencing a nightmare world. The\n10 people introduced themselves one by\none. And as they did so, their eyes\ninvoluntarily turned to Sumu, clearly\nshowing some curiosity about this newly\narrived superhuman minister. Then Murong\nMoonly explained the purpose of\ngathering everyone. The reason I've\ngathered everyone here today is not just\nto introduce Minister Su and Mr. Yong,\nbut also to discuss an important matter.\nI've decided to assemble a team to\nexplore the abandoned city area in two\ndays. These words caused some commotion\namong the crowd. Some frowned while\nothers looked fearful. Abandoned urban\narea. Sumu's eyes flickered slightly as\nintelligence about the abandoned city\nflashed through his mind. As the\ncommander of the Viper gang, his\ninformation network was far superior to\nthat of ordinary people, including\ninformation about the abandoned city.\nShingqing is divided into 20 districts.\nDistricts 1 through 10 are the upper\ndistrict, and districts 11 through 20th\nare the lower district. In fact, a long\ntime ago, Shingqing did not have 20\ndistricts, but 21. Legend has it that\nmore than 10 years ago, a plague\noutbreak nearly wiped out the entire\npopulation of District 21. To prevent\nthe spread of the plague, the Empire\nordered the district to be sealed off.\nOver time, District 21 disappeared from\npeople's sight and became a ruined area.\nThe abandoned city is teeming with\nplague. Exploring this hell hole is just\nsending us to our deaths. A woman with\nheavy makeup said, her expression\nslightly agitated. Yeah, what's so\ninteresting about exploring that\ngodforsaken place? We joined the bronze\ncoffin to find a way to deal with the\nnightmare world, not to die in vain.\nEveryone echoed this sentiment, clearly\ndisapproving of Murang Mungli s\ndecision. Sumu also noticed that Murang\nMungi didn't seem to have much authority\namong these people. He quickly thought\nof Han Yu. When he invited him and Yong\nDoning before, Hanu had obviously\ndeliberately sabotaged the process.\nThese people might have been secretly\ninstigated by Han Yu. Faced with the\ncrowds questions, the noble lady showed\nno anger on her face and calmly said,\n\"The plague is what the Empire calls it.\nThe truth is that the nightmare invasion\ncaused District 21 to become a ruin. The\nnightmare that caused the chaos back\nthen has been killed by the Empire's\nhigh command. But because the area has\nbeen contaminated by the nightmare, it\nhas become unsuitable for human\nhabitation. So, it has gradually fallen\ninto ruin. In fact, it wasn't completely\ndeserted. There were also scavengers,\nfugitives, or people hiding from\nenemies. That's dangerous, too. Who\nknows if there are any remaining\nnightmare monsters inside? Shouted a\nburly man with tattooed arms. Mentioning\nthe nightmare monster caused everyone's\nfaces to turn pale, clearly recalling\nterrifying memories. 1 million [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\nMunley held up a long slender fair\nfinger. The words seemed to possess some\nkind of magical power, instantly\nsilencing the entire scene. Each person\nparticipating in this exploration\nmission will receive 1 million. And in\nthe event of injury or death, the\ncompany will provide double the\ncompensation to your family. The\nexpressions on everyone's faces varied.\nSome had a burning desire in their eyes,\nwhile others hesitated. Since ancient\ntimes, money has been a powerful\nmotivator. The day they became nightmare\napostles, they knew they wouldn't live\nmuch longer, so they might as well make\nmore money, either to indulge in a life\nof luxury or to leave for their\nfamilies. This was one of the reasons\nthey joined the company. Sumu sighed\nslightly. Nobles are indeed rich. 1\nmillion per person. 10 people would be\n10 million, not even counting the\nappearance fees for himself and Yong\nDonging, the two extraordinary\nindividuals. Despite controlling a\npowerful gang, his actual usable funds\nare only around 10 million, while others\ncan generate over 10 million with a\nsingle mission. Even Yong Doning was\ntempted by this number. Today, Yong\nDoning had already changed into a\nfashionable new outfit. A loose graffiti\nprint t-shirt, a black leather jacket,\nwhite ripped skinny jeans that exposed\nher knees, and white high-top sneakers\nwith fluorescent green laces that made\nthem stand out. He bought this outfit\nlast night, spending on 1/10enth of his\nentire savings. Then, he used the\nremaining nine tents to buy Jasmine a\nrevealing backless skirt. At this\nmoment, he was short of money. And when\nhe heard that it cost 1 million, his\nheart started pounding uncontrollably.\nHow many clothes could that buy for\nJasmine? However, coming from the\ndowntown area, he clearly underestimated\nthe greed in human nature. The tattooed\nman suddenly spoke up. I know the\nabandoned city area. The people there\nare all ruthless killers who don't blink\nan eye. And there are also many\nremaining nightmare monsters. It's no\nless dangerous than the nightmare world.\nAsking us to explore it is tantamount to\nsending us to our deaths. Moro Moonly\nfrowned slightly. I'm not forcing\nanyone. This mission is entirely\nvoluntary. If you don't want to go, you\ndon't have to. The tattooed man shook\nhis head. It's not that I don't want to\ngo. What I mean is it'll cost extra.\nYes, more money. I can already feel the\ncall of the next nightmare world. I\ncould enter the nightmare world at any\ntime. I need enough money to buy a noble\nfantasm. I must pay more. The speaker\nwas a middle-aged man wearing a white\nshirt and gold rimmed glasses who was\nbalding. He was the most agitated person\npresent and the fear between his brows\nwas unmistakable. \"How many do you\nwant?\" Murungly asked coldly. \"2\nmillion. Pay up front, then we'll get\nthe work done.\" \"I want 3 million,\" the\ntattooed man exclaimed. \"I've been to\nthe abandoned city before. I'm more\nexperienced than them, so the price will\nbe higher.\" Someone objected. We're&lt;unk&gt;\nall nightmare apostles. Why is your\nprice higher? Let's all go for 3\nmillion. As the scene spiraled out of\ncontrol, Moro Mungley felt a headache\ncoming on. Her noble status was no match\nfor these dying people. They were going\nto die anyway, and they didn't care\nabout anything anymore. Thump. The sound\nof a wooden stick striking the floor\nrang out, not loud, but like a pebble\nthrown into a calm lake, creating\nripples. The chaotic scene felt eerily\nquiet, and the 10 nightmare apostles\ninvoluntarily looked towards Sumu. Sumu\nplaced his hands folded on his snakeskin\ncane, his brown glasses slowly sweeping\nover the crowd, a hint of disappointment\nappearing in his eyes. My colleagues,\nyou have disappointed me greatly. His\ncalm tone carried a hint of\ndisappointment, like a respected teacher\nreprimanding a naughty student. Chapter\n69. Suzu. A sense of guilt welled up in\neveryone's hearts, and they suddenly\nfelt that they had let down Minister\nSue's expectations. The company doesn't\nmind that you are a group of people who\nare about to die and even provides you\nwith jobs. Now, in order to increase\nyour chances of survival when you enter\nthe nightmare world next time, we have\ngone to great lengths to send you to the\nabandoned city for training. Such a good\nopportunity is something that others\ncan't buy with money. But what about\nyou? Not only do you not cherish it, but\nyou also demand exorbitant amounts of\nmoney and valuables. Do you think that's\nright? Upon hearing this, Muro Mungly s\nbeautiful eyes widened involuntarily.\nShe had thought Sumu was going to use\nhis status as a superhum to oppress\neveryone. But she never expected him to\nsay something like this. Wasn't this\ngoing to incite public outrage? But what\nshocked her even more was what happened\nnext? The nightmare apostles who had\nbeen shouting about the price earlier\nwere now all bowing their heads in\nshame. One of the younger girls even\nstarted sobbing. Minister Sue, I was\nwrong. More lung. Minister Sue, you're\nright to reprimand me. I'm such a\nscoundrel. The company gave me a job and\nan opportunity to gain experience. How\ncould I let the company spend money on\nme? I'm personally willing to contribute\n50,000 or even 100,000 to subsidize the\ncompany,\" the tattooed man said with\nshame. Faced with the guilty looks of\nthe crowd, Sumu shook his head with a\nheavy expression. \"The company doesn't\nwant your money as long as you can\nunderstand the company's good\nintentions.\" Upon hearing that the\ncompany didn't even want the money,\neveryone felt even more ashamed. Murang\nMungly s ability to control her\nexpressions failed her. Her rosy lips\nparted slightly and her eyes widened\ninvoluntarily. At this moment, although\nshe had lost some of the aloofness of a\nfemale CEO, she appeared even more real\nand touching, looking at the crowd who\nwere so ashamed they wanted to disappear\ninto the ground. She even absurdly\nwondered if these people would suddenly\nwake up at night and slap themselves in\nthe face and then say, \"I deserve to\ndie. All right, all of you go and\nreflect on your actions.\" With Sumu's\norder, the ashamed crowd all left. Then\nhe walked towards Murley. Murley s eyes\nrevealed a complicated emotion. Just as\nshe was about to thank him, she heard a\ndeep and magnetic voice in her ear.\nRemember to transfer all their money to\nme. Murong Mungli. She stood frozen in\nplace, the word thank you stuck in her\nthroat, unable to be uttered for a\nmoment. Sumu ignored the dazed Murang\nMungli and instead strolled around the\nextraordinary base. After all, it was\nhis future workplace, so he definitely\nneeded to familiarize himself with it\nbeforehand. Before long, his gaze was\ndrawn to a closed plaza with silver\nwhite walls that looked very hard. There\nwere also some steel mannequins and\nfitness equipment placed there. There\nwere many marks on the walls and the\nmannequin, including fist marks and\nsword marks. This is the training room,\na training ground for extraordinary\nindividuals. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Mungly s voice\nsounded behind Sumu. Sumu turned around\nand saw that the noble lady had returned\nto her previous composed and calm\ndemeanor. He pointed to the marks on the\nmannequin. Who left these marks? Hanu\nsometimes comes here to train. Sumu\nraised an eyebrow. Hanu uses a sword.\nMurang Mungly glanced at the sword marks\non the dummy, a look of confusion\nflashing in her eyes. Perhaps Sumu\nnodded thoughtfully and did not ask any\nfurther questions. By the way, Minister\nSu, do you have time for a simple lunch?\nAnd Mr. Yang, since you two are new to\nShanching District, I should at least\nextend some hospitality. Murang Mungly\npolitely invited. Yong Donging\nhesitated. He missed Jasmine. The young\ncouple was in the throws of new love,\nand he had to leave for the abandoned\ncity in 2 days, which would mean parting\nways with Jasmine again. Most\nimportantly, he also wanted to see\nJasmine wear that revealing backless\nskirt. Mr. Yang, if you have important\nmatters to attend to, you can take care\nof them first. There will be many\nopportunities in the future. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\nMungly noticed Yong Doning&lt;unk&gt;s\nhesitation. Yong Doning nodded. I do\nhave something very important to take\ncare of. You guys go ahead and eat. In\nthe end, only Sumu and Murang Mly went\nto eat. In a private room of an upscale\nrestaurant, Miss Murong seems to have\nsomething to say to me. Sumu asked\ngracefully, cutting the fine M9 steak.\nWhat does Mr. Sue usually like? Morong\nMungley smiled, but this time her smile\nwas less distant. Smoking and drinking.\nMurung Mungly paused slightly, then\nsmiled and said, \"I thought a gentleman\nlike Mr. Su might have some unusual\nhobbies.\" Sumu smiled slightly, pushed\nthe cut steak in front of Murang\nMungley, and then took the steak that\nshe hadn't touched. Then, let me put it\nanother way. I like the clouds in the\ncigarette pack and the sea in the wine\nglass. Mungley, who was eating steak,\ncouldn help but smile, but still\npolitely finished chewing the steak,\ngently wiped the corner of her mouth\nwith a tissue and said, \"Mr. Sue is\nindeed extraordinary.\" She raised her\nwine glass in a gesture, \"But that's not\nwhat I'm asking about. Bite.\" The two\nclinkedked glasses gently and drank the\ncrimson wine in one gulp. I'm asking Mr.\nSue whether he prefers money or\ntreasures. What does Miss Mong mean?\nSumu&lt;unk&gt;s eyes flickered slightly, and\nhe vaguely guessed what the other party\nwas thinking. Mr. Sue, we are already\nbusiness partners. Calling me Miss Mong\nis too formal. Besides, in some\nsituations, this surname would directly\nreveal my noble status. You can just\ncall me Mli. Mong Mly s red lips curved\nslightly. Although there was no hint of\ncocaine or seduction, it was enough to\nmake any man's heart race. Okay, Miss\nMley, you can also call me by my name.\nMongley pursed her lips slightly. The\nwine she had drunk earlier was still\ntaking effect, bringing a blush to her\nfair and beautiful face. She glanced at\nSu Mu with a strange look in her eyes.\nOkay, Su. Su. Su. Sumu raised an\neyebrow. He didn't like women who lacked\nboundaries. But Murong Moon seemed\noblivious. Suzu, you still haven't\nanswered my question. Do you like money\nor treasures? I don't like any of them.\nSo, Suzu, what do you like? Murang\nMungly asked, clinking glasses again.\nThe two drank their wine in one gulp.\nSumu frowned slightly as he looked at\nthe woman in front of him, whose face\nwas rosy. He noticed that her eyes\nseemed to be covered with a layer of\nmist, giving her a hazy look. The\nviscous almost stringy look in his eyes\nreminded him of the term innate tidelike\nsacred body. A physique he had a\nreinforced version of in his dreams.\nChapter 70. Your honey trap was rather\nclumsy. Is your alcohol tolerance that\nlow? Otherwise, why would a dignified\nand composed noble lady call herself\nSuzu? Morong Mingly noticed Su Mu\nstaring at her. And whether it was her\nimagination or not, her face seemed to\nturn even redder. You wouldn't happen to\nlike. That's right. I like extraordinary\npotions, preferably ones like iron heart\nthat can enhance physical abilities.\nMorly, extraordinary potions are in high\ndemand and difficult to obtain. I\noriginally planned to use my treasure to\npay for this operation. If you insist,\nSuzu, I can send someone to inquire\nabout the extraordinary potions. Thank\nyou for your trouble. Although Sumu was\nalso quite interested in the treasure,\nhe knew that the extraordinary potion\nwas the most suitable for him since he\nonly had one month to live. Obtaining a\nbody strengthening extraordinary potion\nand gaining abilities similar to Yong\nDonging would be the best way to extend\nhis life. Suzu, I think your bronze law\nis related to the spirit, so physical\nenhancement potions are probably not\nsuitable for you. She tilted her head\nslightly, looking at Sumu, her slender\nfingers gently brushing a few strands of\nhair from her forehead and tucking them\nbehind her ears. A faint smile appeared\non her lips. A simple gesture full of\ncharm. Excuse my bluntness, Miss\nMoonley, but your honey trap is rather\nclumsy. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Mly s hand, which was\ntossing her hair, froze. She didn't know\nwhether to put it down or continue. The\neyes hidden behind the brown glasses\nseemed to possess a certain insight into\npeople's hearts. Looking at the stiff\n[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Mungley, he said indifferently. It\nseems that Miss Mingly s predicament is\ngreater than I imagined. Otherwise, I\nreally can't find a reason to explain\nyour behavior. At this moment, Murong\nMungley had withdrawn her hand, and the\nsmile on her face slowly faded. Perhaps\nout of resentment and stubbornness, she\nasked, \"Am I really that unfeminine?\"\n\"No, Miss Mingley is the most beautiful\nwoman I have ever seen in real life. I'm\nnot your type. I like young women with a\ngirlish charm and young women with a\ngirlish charm. You happen to be the\nlatter. And you? However, I prefer\nextraordinary potions to women. Sumu\nsaid frankly. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Mongi was stunned\nfor a long time. She looked at Sumu, who\nwas looking very serious and couldn't\nhelp but burst out laughing. This time,\nher smile seemed to have let down all\nher guard, and it had a kind of girish\ninnocence. Suzu, you are really funny.\nThank you for the compliment. Murang\nMung Le's smile faded and she became\nmuch more serious. You are a smart\nperson. I can't control someone like\nyou, but I do need an ally like you.\nRight now, all I can give you is\nsincerity and a promise if you are still\nwilling to listen. I'm all ears, Sumu\nsaid with a faint smile. I'm sure you've\nnoticed that besides a noble title and\nsome money, I have nothing else. Even\nthe bronze coffin is still in its\ninfancy. Under Han Yu&lt;unk&gt;s instigation,\nmy employees don't respect me as a\nnobleman. Sumu nodded without\ninterrupting. I am an illegitimate\nchild. Murang Mli&lt;unk&gt;s expression\nbecame increasingly less expressive as\nshe recounted her story like an\noutsider. My mother was once a slave and\nwas bought by my father. Later I was\nborn. Actually, I shouldn't have been\nborn because my identity would bring\nshame to the entire Mong family. But\ncoincidentally, I was born on my\nfather's birthday and my mother begged\nme. So, I was born. After I came of age,\nI did not receive the support of my\nfamily or have my own business like my\nbrothers and sisters. Instead, I was\nimprisoned in the manor and not allowed\nto go out. The reason I received support\nto establish the bronze coffin is\nbecause my father is dying. He is a\nsilver tier three transcendent. In his\nyouth, he consumed too many transcendent\npotions and used many forbidden methods\nto advance, which overdraws his\nlifespan. Now his only way to survive is\nto find the golden eye, refine it into a\ngold level awakening potion and then\nadvance to gold. This has always been\nhis dream to become a golden warrior,\nrestore the glory of his ancestors, and\nthen return to the capital and the\ncenter of power. Driven by a desperate\nwill to survive in his dreams. He had\nlost his mind, refusing to let go of any\nhope, sending all his children to search\nfor the golden eye. It was at this time\nthat I got my chance. Su Mu frowned\nslightly, not because of the other\nparty's tragic background, but because\nhe sensed something was wrong. What\nabout Hanu? He was sent by your father\nto help you. But why is he going against\nyou at every turn? This seems to\ncontradict your father's purpose. Hanu\nMurong Mungly as smile turned cold.\nAlthough he belongs to the Morong\nfamily, he has actually been bribed by\nmy fiance. Fiance? Yes, you may have\nheard his name. Chin Zaheo, the richest\nman in Shing, a rich fat man. Although\nhe is rich, he is not an aristocrat. But\nhe has always longed for the status of\nan aristocrat. He often wanders in\naristocratic circles hoping to marry a\nnoble lady. But nobles would never look\ndown on a nuvo ree like him. And no no\nnoble would ever marry him except for\nme. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Mley's eyes revealed an\nextreme disgust as if she really hated\nShinzah. Shin Zaheo, who had been turned\ndown everywhere, realized his own status\nand knew that in the eyes of the\nnobility, he was just a fool with too\nmuch money. So, he compromised and\napproached my father, spending a lot of\nmoney to get my father to agree to the\nmarriage. Sumu nodded, indicating his\nunderstanding. If an unwanted,\nillegitimate daughter could be sold for\na high price, the head of the family\nwould definitely be willing to do so. I\nthink I understand, Miss Mly, but why\nwould she zeo bribe Hanu to oppose you?\nMurang Mli&lt;unk&gt;s eyes burned with even\nmore hatred because my father promised\nthat the child who finds the golden, I\nwill be made the family heir. If I were\nto become the family heir, it would be\nimpossible for me to marry Chinaheo. The\nfamily would not allow its future heir\nto marry a commoner, no matter how rich\nthe other party is. In fact, among all\nmy children, I am undoubtedly the\nweakest. I have neither awakened the\ntalent within the Golden Bloodline nor\nhave many assets or manpower. Relatively\nspeaking, I am also the least likely to\nfind a golden eye. But Shin Zaheo was an\nextremely cautious man. He was unwilling\nto take any risks and would nip any\nopportunity in the bud, no matter how\nsmall. Mungley, whose eyes were filled\nwith hatred. And at this moment, he\ncompletely understood why the other\nparty had so easily let him invest and\neven directly revealed her true colors.\nbecause she had no other choice. After\n20 years of suppressed life, she finally\nsaw hope and started her own company\nonly to be secretly thwarted by her\nfiance\u00e9. She had been driven to the\nbrink of despair and to survive under\nthe weight of her family and her\nfiance\u00e9. She could only seek external\nhelp to break the deadlock, and she\nherself was the external force she\nsought out. Thinking of this, a strange\nlook appeared in his mind. Perhaps the\nscene of frightening Han Yu to kneel\ndown had caused Murung Mungly to\nmisunderstand, making her think that he\nwas very powerful and capable of dealing\nwith the Imperial nobles and the richest\nman in Shing. This made Su Mu exclaim,\n\"You're really good at judging people.\"\nChapter 71. You smell so good. Suzu,\nI've told you the truth, and I promise\nyou that if you're willing to help me, I\ncan give you everything I have. If we\ncan find the golden eye, the Mong family\nwill be your greatest asset in the\nfuture. Murong Mungley looked directly\ninto Su Mu&lt;unk&gt;s eyes. Her gaze filled\nwith determination and sincerity.\nIt's&lt;unk&gt; unclear whether Murong Mungley\nhas some kind of quirky sense of humor,\nbut she hasn't changed how she addresses\nhim yet. What if we can't find it?\nMurang Mly smiled, but there was a hint\nof coldness in her smile. Even if you\ncan't find me, I won't let you have paid\nfor nothing. I will give you all my\nassets, the bronze coffin, and even my\nown body. You might think it's\ndespicable of me to say such things, but\nI have never been with a man. The reason\nI'm doing this is more out of revenge.\nIf I can't find a golden eye, I'll have\nno choice but to marry Chin Zaheo as my\nfamily has arranged. But before that, I\nmust find a man, and that man is you.\"\nShe picked up the wine glass on the\ntable and drank it all in one gulp. In\nthat instant, her face turned even\nredder. Sumu raised an eyebrow. He\nrealized that this woman was unusually\npersistent and insisted on giving him\naway. He could understand that she\ndidn't want to give Chen Zaheo away for\nnothing. But why did she set her sights\non him? He carefully considered his tone\nbefore speaking. \"Miss Mingly, I always\nthought we were friends.\" Murang Mungli\nsuddenly blinked as if she were drunk.\nShe rested her cheek on her hand and\nstared straight at Sumu, his handsome\nand flawless face reflected in her\npupils. She parted her red lips\nslightly. Is friendship such an\ninconvenient thing? What's wrong with\ngood friends sharing a bed? He right.\nYou know what? Because of my childhood\nexperiences, I actually really hate men.\nBut after meeting you, I realized that\nwhat I hate is stinky men. You are\ndifferent from them. Mongli s eyes grew\nincreasingly hazy and her delicate\nlittle nose wrinkled slightly. You smell\nso good. You give me the feeling that I\ncould eat your saliva. Sumu silently\npushed up his brown tinted glasses. Miss\nMunley, you're drunk. Afterwards, Sumu\ntook Murang Mungley back to the company,\nhelped her take off her high heels, and\ngentlemanly covered her with a blanket.\nAlthough the other party said some lewd\nthings, she was unusually quiet in her\ndrunken state and had already fallen\ninto a deep sleep. However, her brows\nwere furrowed from time to time, and her\neyes were filled with a helpless hatred,\nmaking her look somewhat pitiful. After\nSumu left, Morungi silently opened her\neyes on the bed. She looked angrily at\nthe ceiling and muttered, \"Damn, Suzu,\neven this can't win you over.\" The scene\nof the meal and Su Mu&lt;unk&gt;s reaction\nkept flashing through her mind. She felt\ninexplicably embarrassed and angry, and\nher teeth itched with rage. Finally, she\nbit down on the quilt and started\ntearing at it like a spoiled puppy. Her\nlife experiences made it difficult for\nher to trust others. Although Sumu\nagreed to help her, she instinctively\nwanted to put another strong chain\nbetween them. What else can a woman rely\non to keep a man, but clearly she\nfailed? Sumu left and returned to\nDistrict 13. He had always known that\nMurley was pretending to be asleep, but\nhe didn't point it out and even agreed\nto her request. He had his own plans. He\nhad previously thought he could use his\nhypnotic abilities to open a passage in\nthe upper city and then search for\nextraordinary potions. But now he had\nchanged his mind. Murang Mungley, born\nout of wedlock, possesses a defensive\nartifact that can resist hypnosis. let\nalone other nobles. This means that he\nsimply cannot control a noble in a short\nperiod of time. However, extraordinary\npotions, artifacts, and other such items\nare basically controlled by the nobles.\nTherefore, cooperation is the best\noption as a nobleman with little power\nis relatively easier to control. 3 days\nlater, at the appointed time, Sumu\ncalled Yong Donging and they set off\ntogether. This time he did not bring any\nof the Viper gangs underlings because he\nwas already a superhuman and ordinary\npeople could offer him less and less\nhelp. In addition, there were still\nquite a few nightmare apostles available\nfor this exploration of the abandoned\ncity, so he was not short of people.\nWhen he saw Yong Doning again, he found\nthe passionate young man hanging his\nhead, his face full of dejection and\ndespair as if he had been dumped. You\nbroke up. Yong Doning remained silent,\nhis face blank. Sumu didn't say anything\nmore and took Yong Doning directly to\nthe upper city district. The silence\nlasted for a long time on the way before\nYong Doning finally asked, \"Does love\nreally exist in this world?\" Sumu\nfrowned slightly. He had no interest in\nbeing a relationship counselor, so he\ndidn't respond. He just felt a little\nsad about the fickleness of love. The\ncouple who were threatening suicide just\nmoments ago had broken up after only a\nfew days together. Although such\nexamples are few, they are not uncommon.\nMen and women who fall in love on\nimpulse disregard everything. But when\ntheir passion cools down, they find that\nthey are not suitable for each other in\nthe mundane days of living together. At\nthis moment, he was even thinking about\nwhether he should help Yong Dona find\nanother woman, otherwise he would be\ndifficult to control. Yong Doning,\nunaware of Sumu&lt;unk&gt;s thoughts, said to\nhimself, \"Jasmine cheated on me.\"\nCheating? Sumu's eyes flickered\nslightly. This was different from the\nquarrel he had expected. Why would\nJasmine cheat on him? He knew Jasmine\nwell. She was stubborn, kind, and also\nvery realistic. After winning over Yong\nDona, such a woman would not choose to\ncheat on him. Otherwise, where would she\nfind another superhuman boyfriend? He\nfelt there might be more to the story.\nWhy did Jasmine cheat on her husband?\nAnd who was he with? Yong Donging raised\nhis head and looked at Sumu, his eyes\nfilled with grief. Sumu's expression was\na little strange, fearing that the other\nparty would say something like, \"You\nnext? I don't know. She won't say.\" Then\nhow do you know she cheated on you? Yang\nDonging became agitated. Yesterday I saw\na red mark on Jasmine's neck and she was\nwearing expensive new clothes. She must\nhave met some rich people while\nperforming and singing all these days. I\nasked her where the red mark came from.\nBut she stammered and couldn't give me a\nclear answer for a long time. That\n[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I misjudged her. I loved her so\nmuch. But she he buried his head between\nhis hands and judging from his trembling\nshoulders, he must have been crying.\nSumu had a vague feeling that something\nwas wrong. This was not something\nJasmine would do. There was no reason\nfor her to cheat on him. Could it be\nthat someone was forcing her? However,\nhe did not voice his suspicions. The\nmost important thing now was to explore\nthe abandoned city area, not to waste\ntime on Jasmine. Chapter 72. The\nvanished. Suzu. Mr. Yang, you've\narrived. Inside the bronze coffin,\nMongley had regained her usual aloof\ndemeanor. every move perfectly embodying\nthe elegant and composed persona of a\nnoble woman except for this unchanging\nform of a dress. Even more distressed\nwhen he heard the name Suzu and his gaze\nswept over the two of them. This feeling\nis just like when you're heartbroken and\nyou're about to confide in a friend only\nto find out that your friend just got a\nstunningly beautiful girlfriend. A\ndouble blow. It's certainly painful to\nbe doing poorly yourself, but it's even\nmore painful to discover that your\nfriends are doing quite well. What's\nwrong with Mr. Yang? Murong Moonly\nnoticed that something was wrong with\nYong Donging and couldn't help but ask.\nIt's nothing, just a breakup. Mong\nMoonly looked puzzled but didn't say\nmuch. She went straight to the point and\nsaid, \"I haven't mentioned the purpose\nof exploring the abandoned city area\nbefore, mainly because I was afraid of\nleaking information. Now that the\noperation is about to begin, I'll be\nfrank. Please take a look.\" She took out\na golden leaf from her handbag. The leaf\nhad distinct and lifelike textures,\nmaking it seem as if it were a naturally\ngrown golden leaf rather than a handmade\npiece. I bought this golden leaf from a\nscavenger in the abandoned city. I\ncarefully compared it with the records\nin my family. It should be a leaf that\nfell from the golden tree and the golden\neye is the fruit of the golden tree. So,\nI guess that there is a high possibility\nthat there are clues to the golden eye\nin the abandoned city. Sumu nodded. He\nhad already guessed [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Munley as\npurpose. Why would she need to explore\nthe abandoned city if it wasn't for the\ngolden eye? He took the golden leaf from\nMurong Moon's hand and found that it\nfelt very strange. It looked like gold,\nbut it felt like a leaf. Where are those\nnightmare apostles? Have they arrived\nyet? All seven of them came, and no one\nbacked down. Suzu, your words must have\nstruck a chord with them. They really\ndid reflect on their actions after they\nwent back. Mongli rarely joked. It was\nno surprise to Su Mu that everyone had\narrived. His mental strength was\nincreasing day by day, especially after\nhe obtained the immaculate heart and all\nthings in the universe, which caused it\nto surge. Hypnotizing the seven\nnightmare apostles, who were still\nordinary people, was naturally a piece\nof cake. I'm curious why we had to bring\nthese seven ordinary people along. Even\nif they are nightmare apostles, their\nactual combat power is probably not as\ngood as that of professionally trained\nmercenaries. Indeed, their combat\nstrength is weak. But the purpose this\ntime is not to fight, but to find clues.\nThe biggest difference between nightmare\napostles and ordinary people is that\nthey have a special sense for monsters\nand objects in the nightmare world. A\nbit like a woman's intuition. This will\nmake it easier for you to search. Soon,\nled by Murong Mungli, they arrived at\nthe underground base and met the seven\nnightmare apostles they had met before.\nWhile Murong Mungley was explaining the\ntask, Sumu pulled down his glasses and a\nflash of azure light appeared in his\nsurged into the seven people's bodies,\nintensifying the hypnosis. Suzu, this is\na route map given by the scavengers. The\narea circled in red is where the golden\nleaves were found, and it is also your\nprimary target for this exploration.\nSumu carefully put away the route map,\nand without wasting any time, led\neveryone to set off before dawn. The two\nvans headed straight for the abandoned\ncity area. Upon arriving in the\nabandoned city, the group felt as if\nthey had entered another world. What\ncomes into view is a hazy gray smog\nbeneath which lie countless broken walls\nand ruins. Human buildings have become\nextremely dilapitated. Their reinforced\nconcrete skeletons teetering on the\nverge of collapse. On the dimly lit\nstreet, broken glass shards and\nabandoned vehicles are everywhere. The\ntrees on both sides of the road grow\nwildly as if they have undergone some\nkind of mutation, growing crookedly and\ncovered with tumor-like protrusions. The\nvehicle continued forward, enveloped by\nthe fog, until the ruins on the street\nblocked its path, at which point it\nslowly came to a stop. Everyone get off\nthe bus. At Sumu's command, all five\nnightmare apostles disembarked. What a\nthick smock. It wasn't like this when I\ncame here last year. The tattooed man\namong the nightmare apostles fanned his\narms vigorously, trying to blow away the\npolluted air. Sumu glanced at everyone\nand noticed that one person was missing.\nHe frowned and called out, \"Yong\nDoning.\" A moment later, Yong Doning got\nout of the car looking reluctant.\nClearly heartbroken, he didn't want to\ndo anything at the moment. \"Let's go,\nYong Doning, lead the way.\" Sumu took\nout a clean white handkerchief and\ncovered his mouth and nose. Although the\npungent smog would not harm his pure\nbody, the smell was indeed unpleasant.\nThe group began to move forward through\nthe smog. Out of fear of the abandoned\ncity, the five nightmare apostles were\nvery nervous and unconsciously gripped\ntheir guns tightly. Sumu carefully\nobserved his surroundings. As a\nsuperhuman, his visibility was better\nthan that of ordinary people. Even in\nthe smog, he saw that the signs of the\nroadside shops had faded and the words\nwere blurred. There were signs of being\npried open on the doors, and the shop\nwindows were covered with thick dust and\ncobwebs. Some abandoned factory walls\nare also covered with moss and vines.\nThis is a forgotten district, so quiet\nit's almost deathly still. There's\nsomething here. Yong Donging, who was\nleading the way, suddenly stopped.\nEveryone looked in the direction of the\nvoice and saw that there was a baby's\ncorpse lying not far in front of Yong\nDoning. The baby was chubby and\nfair-skinned and looked very cute, but\nthere was a bloody hole in its little\nhead which was pierced by a bullet. A\nfemale nightmare apostle's face turned\ndeathly pale. This is inhumane. Why\nshoot a baby? This is not a baby. Sumu\npushed up his brown glasses and led\neveryone closer to the baby. Everyone\nfinally understood why Sumu said it\nwasn't a baby. The baby's lower body was\nsurprisingly covered with eight jet\nblack spider legs covered in downy hair.\nSumu wiped the strange baby's wound with\na handkerchief, which was immediately\nstained with yellowish green blood. He\nexamined the dryness of the blood and\nsaid, \"The strange baby hasn't been dead\nfor long, probably within the last day\nor two. It's&lt;unk&gt; possible that someone\ncame here before us.\" Then he prepared\nto throw the handkerchief away, but at\nthat moment, he couldn't help but lower\nhis gaze and stare intently at a corner\nof the handkerchief. There was a single\ncharacter written in that corner. It was\nwritten in pen. Remember? Sumu frowned,\nstaring at the word record on his\nhandkerchief. He had no idea why there\nwas an extra word record on his\nhandkerchief, which he always carried\nwith him. Because he used to get\nnosebleleeds frequently, he carried a\nhandkerchief with him every day. But now\nthe handkerchief I always carry with me\nhas been written on by someone. To do\nthis without being detected by my\npowerful mental strength. What kind of\nability must the person who wrote it be?\nChapter 73. Words I wrote myself. Wait,\nsomething's not right. Sumu carefully\nexamined the character. G, although it\nlooked a bit crooked and messy, as if it\nhad been written in a hurry. Why was the\nhandwriting so similar to his own? Still\npenmanship, a fountain pen. He reached\ninto his pocket and quickly pulled out a\nfountain pen. This was the pen he always\ncarried with him. It was specially made\nwith a sharp and tough nib, a deadly\nweapon. He wrote the exact same\ncharacter, Jeet, on the handkerchief\nwith a fountain pen. Upon careful\ncomparison, he was shocked to discover\nthat the previous Jeep was written with\nthe same fountain pen. Did I write this\nmyself? Or did someone take my pen and\nimitate my handwriting? If it's the\nlatter, what was their purpose? Sumu\nfell into deep thought. There are still\nmany corpses of strange infants here.\nYong Dongqing shouted from the front.\nSumu pulled himself out of his thoughts\nand stopped thinking about it. A smile\nof interest appeared on his fair and\nhandsome face. Interesting. Regardless\nof who wrote the words, he was already\nexcited. Looks like this trip to the\nabandoned city won't be boring. The\ngroup continued onward, and as they\nventured deeper, they encountered more\nand more corpses of strange infants\nalong the way. Most of them had their\nheads blown off by guns, while others\nhad their bodies shattered by some kind\nof immense force. W suddenly, a woman's\nplaintiff sobbing drifted from afar.\nSomeone is crying. Could it be a\nscavenger? Yong Doning stopped and\nlooked in the direction of the sound. He\nsaw a woman dressed in white squatting\non the ground crying deep in the fog.\nThe woman had her back to everyone and\nher long black hair was hanging down to\nthe ground. Everyone felt a chill run\ndown their spines. None of them were\nfools and naturally they wouldn't\nbelieve that a human woman would be\ncrying in such a strange place. Sumu\nsmiled and gestured for Yong Doning to\nask. Yong Doning nodded and approached\nthe woman step by step. Are you all\nright? Wow, my child is missing. Have\nyou seen my child? The woman heard\nvoices and quickly got up and turned\naround. The terrifying scene I had\nimagined did not appear. The woman did\nindeed have a human face and instead of\nbeing scary, she was incredibly\nbeautiful. Her tearful appearance made\nher look pitiful. Did you lose your\nchild? Yong Donging was not fooled by\nthe other woman's beauty because he was\nheartbroken and was hostile towards\nwomen, especially beautiful ones. The\nwoman stared at Yong Dongqing, her face\nsuddenly contorted with extreme hatred.\nIt was you. You killed my child. Yong\nDong&lt;unk&gt;s expression changed. What\nnonsense are you talking about? Why\nwould I kill your child? It's you. It's\nyou and all of you. The woman screamed\nshrilly, her venomous gaze fixed on the\ncrowd. Sometime later, the human pupils\nbegan to deform as if a force was\nsqueezing them from both sides, turning\nthe round pupils into vertical pupils.\nThe next moment, a bizarre scene\nunfolded. The woman stood still, her\nbody motionless, but her fair and\nslender neck stretched out continuously,\nsuddenly extending 3 m like a giant\nwhite python with her beautiful head\nhanging on it. Fiercely biting at Yong\nDonging. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you. Yong Donging, who was\nalready in a bad mood, became even more\nfurious after being slandered by the\nmonster, he slammed his metallic fists\ndown on the beauty's head. Bang! The\nimmense force sent the beauty's head\nflying several meters away, but it\nquickly stopped flying backward thanks\nto its long neck and let out an inhuman\nroar. Tada! Tatada! A series of metallic\nclanging sounds echoed as countless\nmonstrous infants. Their spider-like\nlegs propelling them out of the thick\nfog emerged. Their cute little faces\nwere contorted with grotesque ferocity\nas they charged towards the group with\nall eight legs working together. Yang\ndrastically. He hadn't expected there to\nbe so many monsters. He could escape\nwith his steel body, but Sumu and the\nothers behind him were probably doomed.\nAll things in the universe. Before\nanyone knew it, Sumu had taken off his\nbrown glasses, revealing his eyes to be\na deep blue, as if reflecting the sky.\nSuddenly, thick fog appeared out of thin\nair all around, enveloping everyone. The\nnext second, several fictional figures\nemerged from the fog and rushed away at\ngreat speed. The woman in white and the\nstrange infants were lured away by the\nillusion and chased after it into the\ndistance. As the fog dissipated, Sumu\nand the others were revealed. Yang\nDonging looked at Sumu with lingering\nfear. You can even hypnotize nightmare\nmonsters. Sumu smiled without saying a\nword. This was not hypnosis, but a\nvisual illusion, a hallucination\nconstructed with mental power. The\nadvantage of synrabanso is that it does\nnot require invading the enemy's mind\nbut directly constructs illusions in the\noutside world which means that it is not\nas limited as hypnosis. Hypnosis has\nlittle effect on people like Murang\nMungley who possess defensive magical\nartifacts or other mentally powerful\nsuperhumans because mental power is\ndifficult to penetrate. However, Sunlu\nWaniang is different. Anyone with eyes\ncan see it. In fact, all things in the\nworld is an extremely difficult ability\nto operate. Hundreds of times more\ndifficult than a heart of steel, which\nis simply a way to strengthen the body\nand can be used by anyone who is not in\na vegetative state. However, the all\nthings in the universe technique\nrequires an extremely high ability to\nconstruct illusions. The whole process\nis like painting with mental energy.\nIt's not something you can do just by\nbeing given a brush and ink. You need a\nlot of practice to paint realistically\nand fast enough to create illusions in\nan instant. It sounds difficult, but for\nSumu, who has dreamt for over a hundred\nyears, it's too easy. He has created\ncountless things in his dreams,\nincluding the world itself, let alone\nmere illusions. In other words, even if\nothers possess the ability of all things\nunder heaven, they cannot compare to\nSumu unless they practice for hundreds\nof years. The group continued on their\nway, clearly more tense after\nexperiencing the monster incident.\nFortunately, they were quite lucky.\nApart from the strange baby and the\nsnake woman, they did not encounter any\nother nightmare monsters and arrived at\nthe area marked on the route map without\nany major incidents. This is a\ndilapitated three-story shopping mall,\nnot very big. The walls are old and\nworn, covered with moss and vines, and\nit has obviously been abandoned for a\nlong time. This should be where the gold\nleaf was found. Let's go in. Sumu walked\ninto the mall expectantly. He first used\nhis mental power to sense the area, but\ndid not detect any monsters. So, he said\nto the group, \"Split up and look for\nclues. Yong Donging and I will search\nthe third floor together. The four of\nyou will work in pairs, each responsible\nfor the first and second floors. We'll\nmeet up on the third floor afterwards.\"\nThe four nightmare apostles nodded and\nthen split into two groups to explore.\nSumu and Yong Donging went to the third\nfloor, which seemed to be a clothing\nstore. Among the many shops were white\nmannequins, but the clothes on these\nmannequins were long gone, as if they\nhad been stripped naked. Chapter 74.\nAwareness. Yong Doning looked at the\nmannequins and nervously swallowed. Do\nyou think these mannequins might\nsuddenly come to life? Sumu smiled\nfaintly. Wouldn't it be more interesting\nif they came back to life? I really\ndidn't ask you that. Yong Donging rolled\nher eyes and continued walking. Sumu\nfollowed behind, letting Yong Donging\nlead the way. But the strange feeling in\nhis heart grew stronger. He felt as if\nhe had forgotten something. What exactly\nhad he forgotten? Holy crap. What the\nhell is this? Yong Donging&lt;unk&gt;s sudden\nexclamation interrupted Su Mu&lt;unk&gt;s\nthoughts and he walked towards Yong\nDoning&lt;unk&gt;s direction. They noticed the\nother person had stopped in front of a\nshop and was nervously looking inside.\nWhen he turned his gaze to the inside of\nthe shop, he couldn't help but frown\nslightly. That's a door. An old wooden\ndoor, painted red, appears to be quite\nold, as much of the red paint has peeled\noff, revealing the original color of the\nwood underneath. The door itself doesn't\nseem special. What's truly unusual is\nthat it stands alone in the center of\nthe shop with nothing behind it. And\nit's open, letting in thick fog, like a\ngateway to another world. There's\nnothing behind this door, but there's\nthick fog inside. Could this be a path\nto hell? Yong Dongqing&lt;unk&gt;s eyes\nrevealed a hint of apprehension, and he\ndared not approach the door easily. Sumu\nnaturally wouldn't risk his life, so he\ndirectly called the nightmare apostle\ndownstairs up. Soon, the tattooed man\nand the bald middle-aged man with gold\nrimmed glasses jogged up. \"Have you\nfound anything down there?\" The two men\nshook their heads. The tattooed man\nsaid, \"The floor I'm in charge of is\ncompletely empty, not to mention the\ngold leaves. Even the shops that sell\ngold and jewelry are empty. There are\nalso many signs of a fight inside,\nprobably stolen by scavengers from\nbefore. Sumu nodded and was about to\ndirect the tattooed man into the door\nwhen he suddenly stopped. He turned to\nYong Doning and asked, \"How many people\ndid we bring with us this time?\" Yong\nDoning was a little confused, seemingly\nthinking that Sumu's question was\nidiotic. Just the two of them. Two. Sumu\nnarrowed his eyes, his eyes behind his\nbrown glasses appearing and\ndisappearing. He did remember bringing\ntwo people with him. But why did it feel\nso strange? The entire bronze coffin\ncompany only have two employees. No, not\ntwo, but seven. A barely perceptible\nazure light flashed in Sumu's eyes. Yang\nDoning looked puzzled. Are you running a\nfever? Where did these seven people come\nfrom? Although I don't remember seven\npeople, I used the mental energy of\nseven people before I left. I remember\nhypnotizing them once before I left.\nAlthough I remember hypnotizing two\npeople, the mental energy consumed\ncannot be faked. Sumu said with\ncertainty. He finally realized something\nwas wrong. His memories had been\naltered. Yong Dona&lt;unk&gt;s expression also\nchanged slightly. You mean just then,\nunnoticed by anyone. The thick fog\ninside the wooden door began to churn\nand wisps of mist began to seep in.\n\"Have you found anything down there?\"\nSumu asked. The two men shook their\nheads. The tattooed man said. The floor\nI'm in charge of is empty. Not to\nmention the gold leaves. Even the shops\nthat sell gold and jewelry are empty. I\nguess the scavengers from before took\nthem. Sumu nodded and said to the\ntattooed man. Go inside and check the\nsituation. He couldn't let Yang Doning\ngo into danger. No one knew what the\nsituation was like inside, and he didn't\nwant to lose a great general for\nnothing. The tattooed man hesitated for\na moment, but under Sumu&lt;unk&gt;s gaze, he\nquickly regained his composure and said\nwithout hesitation, \"Thank you,\nminister, for giving me this\nopportunity. I will certainly live up to\nyour expectations.\" He then stroed\ntoward the wooden door, which was\nshrouded in thick fog, and his figure\nwas gradually swallowed up by the mist.\n\"Holy crap! What the hell is this?\" Yong\nDonging exclaimed, pointing\nincredulously at the shop's door. Sumu\nlooked in the direction of the sound and\nfrowned slightly. There was a door\nshrouded in thick fog. There's nothing\nbehind this door. Could it be a path to\nhell? Yong Donging asked wearily. Go\ninside and check the situation. Sumu\nsaid to the bald man beside him. The\nbald man was so frightened by the\nbottomless fog that his heart nearly\njumped out of his chest. He kept backing\naway saying, \"No, no, no. I'm scared.\"\nSu Mu&lt;unk&gt;s eyes flashed and the bald\nman instantly transformed saying, \"Thank\nyou, minister, for giving me this\nopportunity. It's&lt;unk&gt; all for you,\nMinister.\" Then the bald man strode into\nthe doorway, his figure swallowed by the\nthick fog. Holy crap. What the hell is\nthis? Yong Donging exclaimed, pointing\nfrowned slightly. There was a door with\nno walls on all sides, but thick fog was\nbillowing out from inside. There's\nto hell? Yong Donging asked wearily.\nSumu instinctively wanted to send Yong\nDonging in to investigate, but suddenly\nfroze because this did not conform to\nhis behavior logic. According to his\nlogic, when faced with a place where the\ndangers were unknown, the optimal\nsolution should be to send an ordinary\nperson in first. As the only superhuman\nunder his command, it would be a huge\nloss if Yong Doning were to perish\ninside. But unfortunately, it was just\nthe two of them, Yong Donging and\nhimself here. This gave him a strange\nfeeling. Why did he only take Yong\nDonging with him when he went out?\nMemory and logic clashed at this moment,\nwhich was completely illogical because\nhe rarely went out on his own. Even\nafter becoming a superhum, he still had\nthe habit of bringing his underlings.\nSuperhumans are not invincible and there\nis always more strength in numbers. Is\nthis exploration mission to the bronze\ncoffin just between the two of you? Is\nthe bronze coffin a shell company with\nno employees? Mongley is so useless that\nshe can't even recruit anyone. More and\nmore logical flaws appeared in\nSumu&lt;unk&gt;s mind, but his memory told him\nthat everything made sense, making the\nsense of inongruity even stronger.\nSuddenly, he asked, \"How did we get to\nthe abandoned city?\" Yong Dongqing was\nutterly puzzled, looking at Su Mu as if\nhe were an idiot. \"Of course, I drove\nhere.\" \"How many cars did you drive?\"\nTwo cars, Yong Doning replied without\nhesitation, but then he froze. Two cars?\nWhy would the two of us need two cars?\nHe suddenly widened his eyes, clearly\nrealizing something, and looked sharply\nat Sumu. It must be because you're\nmaking trouble and don't want to ride in\nthe same car as me. So, you drove two\ncars, Sumu. Although he had long known\nthat Yong Dong&lt;unk&gt;s blockhead was\nunreliable, he never expected that the\nother party would be so abstract.\nChapter 75. I cheated on myself. Sumu\ntook out the handkerchief from his\npocket. The yellowish green blood stains\non it had long since dried, but he\nwasn't looking at the blood stains. He\nwas looking at the word record. Looking\nat the character Jeet G, Sumu finally\nunderstood its meaning. It was not\nfinished writing. If it were finished,\nit would be two characters G. He was\nalmost certain that his and Yong Donging\nmemories had been altered. Both the two\ncars and the mental energy consumed were\nevidence of this. And at this moment, he\nalso learned who wrote the character\nJeep. Have you ever considered that\nperhaps this isn't our first time here?\nYong Donging was stunned for a moment.\nNo, you've been talking nonsense since\njust now. Have you been hallucinating\nfrom inhaling too much smog? Sumu smiled\nslightly. Do you remember the snake\nwoman saying that you killed her child?\nIf you weren't here, how could you have\nkilled her child? Yang Doning curled his\nlip. That's a lunatic. You actually\nbelieve what the nightmare monster says.\nWant to know whose hickey is on\nJasmine's neck? Upon hearing this, Yong\ndrastically and a cold glint appeared in\nhis eyes. I knew it was you, Sumu. Oh, I\nreally don't need to explain this to\nyou. But what I can tell you is that you\nprobably left that hickey yourself.\nYou're talking nonsense. I didn't know I\nkissed myself. Take out your phone and\nlook at the date. Think back. Do you\nstill remember yesterday? Although Yong\nDonging was angry, he still obediently\ntook out his phone to check the date.\nThen he froze and finally realized that\nsomething was wrong because he really\ncouldn't remember what he had done\nyesterday. Sumu, what exactly is going\non? Sumu pushed up his brown tinted\nglasses and analyzed. If I'm not\nmistaken, this should be our second time\nin the ruined city and the first time we\nshould have brought 10 nightmare\napostles. 10. Yong Doning asked\nincredulously. Yes. Sumu took out his\nphone and opened the transfer record. I\nasked [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Munley to transfer their\nmoney to me before and she did so that\nvery night. I received a total of 10\nmillion 1 million each which is exactly\n10 people. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Mly said she would set\noff in 2 days but today is the third\nday. This time she should have brought\nseven people because I used up the\nmental energy of seven people through\nhypnosis. That means that three people\ndisappeared in the abandoned city on the\nfirst trip. I guess that's when I first\ncame here and realized that something\nwas wrong with the fog. So, I went back.\nBased on my understanding of myself, I\nshould have gone back to get the gas\nmask the first time, but I found that my\nmemory was still fading on the way. So,\nI wrote a note on a handkerchief.\nUnfortunately, my memory was fading too\nquickly, and I forgot it after writing\nhalf of it. Later, he even forgot about\nthe handkerchief. The strange infant\ncorpse we encountered earlier was\nprobably the one we killed the first\ntime we came here, which is why the\nsnake woman wanted revenge as soon as\nshe saw you. As for Jasmine's\ninfidelity, that's easily explained. You\nwent back once and it was probably left\nbehind during your intimacy, but the fog\nmade you forget. Even Jasmine's memory\nis impaired. And you bought the new\nclothes, too. You can check your bank\naccount if you don't believe me. Yong\nDonging suddenly took out his phone to\ncheck and found that his balance was\nindeed zero. He raised his head in\ndisbelief. I I cheated on myself. Sumu\nignored Yong Dong&lt;unk&gt;s strange focus\nand was thinking of a solution. It was\nclear that the fog here had the ability\nto erode memories. What do we do now? Go\nback. He immediately rejected the idea.\nGoing back would be useless. He had\nalready tried it the first time. Even if\nhe left the fog, his memory would still\ndisappear. In the end, he might even\nforget that he had ever been to the\nabandoned city. Forgetting itself isn't\nscary. What's truly terrifying is\nforgetting itself. This is different\nfrom amnesia. A person with amnesia\nknows they have amnesia and can clearly\nperceive a large blank in their mind.\nBut after inhaling the mist, a person\nwill forget that they have amnesia and\nwill not notice anything unusual. If it\nweren't for a serious logical flaw, Sumu\nwould hardly have realized that he had\nlost his memory. \"Holy crap, what the\nhell is this?\" Yong Doning exclaimed,\npointing incredulously at the shop's\ndoor. Sumu glanced at him. Clearly, Yong\nDonging had lost his memory of what had\njust happened, as if he were seeing the\ndoor for the first time. At the same\ntime, he also felt that the memories in\nhis mind were beginning to blur again.\nBut this time, the blurring was very\nslow because he was using his mental\npower to resist the erosion. Mental\nstrength can still play a role in this\nkind of memory erosion, provided that he\nis aware of the abnormality and actively\nuses his mental strength to resist it.\nLet's go in and take a look. In the end,\nSumu decided to go inside. It was a rare\nopportunity to come across such an\ninteresting place. Wouldn't it be a pity\nnot to go in and take a look? Holy crap.\nThis Shut up. Clear the way. Sumu tapped\nYong Doning on the head with his\nsnakeskin cane, shoeing him into the\nhouse. Soon, both of them were swallowed\nup by the mist. And just after the two\nof them entered, bang. The dilapidated\nwooden door slammed shut. In a luxurious\nmanner in the upper town, have [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\nLingly as two newly recruited\nsuperhumans already gone to the\nabandoned city asked a man weighing over\n300 lb wearing an oversized white suit\nand a red tie. The 300-lb man was\nsitting on a large leather chair, his\nwhole body embedded in it like a lump of\nrotten flesh. Standing before him was\nHan Yu, who was extremely respectful.\nPresident Shin, don't worry. Everything\nhas been arranged. Murang Muni still\nthinks that the golden leaf fell from\nthe golden tree in the abandoned city.\nLittle does she know, the leaf is real,\nbut it doesn't grow in the abandoned\ncity. Instead, you bought it from the\ncapital at a high price. He So far, she\nhas sent several groups of people to the\nabandoned city. Every time those people\ndie there, her memory is altered, and\nshe forgets that she once sent people\ninto the abandoned city. If this cycle\ncontinues, her bronze coffin company\nwill go bankrupt sooner or later. Hanu\nlaughed smugly. Snap. A large fat hand\nwith a silver ring slapped him hard\nacross the face. The terrifying force\nsending Hanu flying. How dare you? M is\nmy fiance\u00e9. How dare you laugh at me? A\ncold glint appeared in Shin Zahe&lt;unk&gt;s\nsmall eyes, squeezed by his fat. Han Yu,\nwho had fallen to the ground, quickly\ngot up and knelt down in fear and\ntrembling, cold sweat pouring down his\nface. I was wrong, President. I spoke\nwithout thinking. Please punish me,\npresident. I don't know if it's just my\nimagination, but Shin Zahi, who just\nknocked Hanu away, seems to have lost a\nlittle weight. Seeing the terrified Han\nYu, Shin Zahi&lt;unk&gt;'s expression calmed\ndown slightly. You said before that\npretty boy named Sumu is quite strong.\nChapter 76, the unrememberable. Yes,\nyes, Sumu's methods are indeed strange.\nBut please rest assured, guild master,\nno matter how strong he is, he can't\nbeat the unmemorable person you spend a\nlot of money to get. As far as I know,\nthis is the second time he has entered\nthe abandoned city. To ensure that\nnothing goes wrong, I specially took a\nmemory potion, sneaked into the\nabandoned city in advance, and threw a\nlot of scavengers into the thick fog.\nNow the unmemorable person is even\nstronger and this time he will\ndefinitely not be able to come out\nalive. Very good. Chi Zaheo nodded in\nsatisfaction. Those who cannot remember\nare very special. I had to ask a silver\nlevel expert with the ability to counter\nthem to handle them. Below the silver\nlevel, unless there is a superhuman with\nthe ability to foresee the future,\nwhoever goes will die. After saying\nthat, he grabbed a piece of exquisite\npastry from the side and stuffed it into\nhis mouth, chewing it heartily. The day\nthe [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] family head announces the\nengagement is getting closer and closer.\nAs long as we get these extraordinary\nindividuals under control, Mungley\ndefinitely won't be able to recruit\nanyone for a while, let alone find a\ngolden eye. In the end, she'll have no\nchoice but to obediently marry me. He a\nlwd smile appeared on Chin Zahe&lt;unk&gt;s\nface. He seemed to have already imagined\nthe scene of pressing that beautiful\nbody down on him. Originally, he just\nwanted to marry a noble woman and become\na nobleman himself, but he did not\nexpect that Murang Mungly, this\nillegitimate daughter, would be so\ngood-looking, so it was perfect.\nPresident Xien, I heard that the second\nyoung master and fourth young lady of\nthe Mong family, also went to the\nabandoned city area. Shien Zaheo smiled\nsarcastically. This chairman spent a lot\nof money to get an amnesiac, so\nnaturally someone has to reimburse me\nfor that money. Han Yu&lt;unk&gt;s expression\nsuddenly tightened. You mean the eldest\nyoung master was also involved? Not too\nstupid. I am on good terms with the\neldest young master of the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] family.\nSo naturally, I will help him become the\nfamily heir. Since I can deceive Mley\nwith the golden leaf, I can also send\nthe message to her other brothers and\nsisters. These people will definitely\nsend superhumans into the ruined city\nlike moths to a flame for the clues to\nthe golden eye. Meanwhile, the young\nmaster who truly knew the inside story\nremained calm and collected, watching\nthem deplete their strength, even if he\ncouldn't find the golden eye then. So\nwhat? How could the others weakened\ncompete with him? Hanu was increasingly\nshocked and developed a deep sense of\nawe for the fat man in front of him. No\nwonder he could become the richest man\nin Shingqing as an ordinary person. His\nmethods were truly ingenious. He\nmanipulated a group of nobles without\nspending a penny. And the only one he\nacquired by spending money who couldn't\nremember anything was reimbursed by the\nyoung master. So he might even make an\nextra profit. The guild master is\nbrilliant. I admire him, but I still\ncan't find a golden eye. What about the\nMorong family head? Ho, that old Deng\nshould have died long ago. I spent a\nfortune to buy his daughter, and he\nstill dared to ask for half of the\nmining rights to the Myithil mine. Do\nyou really think his children genuinely\nwant to find a golden eye to prolong his\nlife? It's all just for show. Even if he\nestablishes an heir, so what? The Morong\nfamily will still be ruled by him. Han\nYu felt a chill run down his spine. The\ndarkness among the nobles terrified even\nthis extraordinary being. The fog has\ndissipated. Yang Donging stared blankly\nat the desolate land where there was no\nfog at all. Logically, stepping through\na foggy door should have led to a misty\nworld, but the result was quite the\nopposite. The door, the door is gone,\ntoo. The place where the two had entered\nwas no longer a door. There was only air\nleft. Sumu carefully examined this\ndesolate land. The ground was bare, all\nred soil without a single plant. The\nground was uneven, with some areas\nrising up like sand dunes and others\nsinking into the ground. Suddenly, his\neyes flickered and locked onto a\ndepression half a meter deep where a\nperson was lying. Yong Doning, \"Go and\ntake a look.\" Faced with the unusual\nsituation, Su Mu sent Yong Dona. Yong\nDoning pouted in dissatisfaction, but\nstill walked towards that direction.\nThis time, without the interference of\nfog, their memories were temporarily\nunaffected. Yong Doning first kicked the\nman, and when the man didn't react, he\ncarefully checked the man's breath.\n\"This is a dead man.\" Sumu walked over,\nleaning on his snake patterned wooden\ncane. The deceased was a man with an\nunfamiliar face, but he died peacefully,\nas if he had died suddenly without\nrealizing it, and there were no wounds\non his body. \"He must be the nightmare\napostle of the bronze coffin,\" Sumu said\nwith certainty. Yang Doning was taken\naback. \"What nonsense are you talking\nabout? There are only the two of us in\nthe bronze coffin.\" Sumu did not explain\nfurther. The reason he was so certain\nwas that he could detect residual mental\nfluctuations from the deceased, proving\nthat he had hypnotized him. The two\ncontinued forward, and along the way,\nthey discovered more and more corpses,\nthe number now exceeding 30. All the\ndead had peaceful faces and no wounds.\nJudging from the residual mental\nfluctuations, eight of the deceased were\nfound in bronze coffins, while the\norigins of the rest are unknown. It\nseems we weren't the first to arrive\nhere. Others have been here before. Sumu\nthoughtfully pushed up his glasses. In a\ndesolate place like the abandoned city\ndistrict, hardly anyone would come.\nMoreover, judging from the deceased\nclothing, several of them were from the\nupper city district. Why would people\nfrom the upper town come here? Is it\nalso for the golden eye? Just as he was\npondering this, he suddenly heard two\nfootsteps behind a small hill not far\naway, as if someone was walking. With a\nleap, his body, enhanced by the\nimmaculate heart, moved as lightly as a\nbird, swiftly soaring onto the hill. He\nlooked closely and immediately frowned.\nAt this moment, Yong Doning also came up\nand his expression changed drastically\nwhen he saw the two people. There were\ntwo men, one in a white shirt with a\nreceding hairline and the other with a\nlarge tattoo on his arm. They looked\nlike normal people. But what really made\nYong Doning&lt;unk&gt;s expression change was\nthat a small monster with white skin and\nfleshy wings was perched on the tattooed\nman s shoulder. The little monster had\nno face, only a large mouth on its head.\nIts bald arm reached into the tattooed\nman s head, groping around and then\npulled out a wad of cotton candy-like\nfilaments and stuffed it into its mouth.\nStrangely, there were no wounds on the\ntattooed man as head. The tattooed man\nand the bald man seemed oblivious to the\nlittle monster and continued walking as\nif they couldn't see it. Watch out for\nthe monster. Yong Donging shouted. The\ntattooed man and the bald man were\nstartled and turned to look at Su Mu and\nhis companion, their eyes flashing with\nsurprise. Are you also trapped here?\nWe're looking for a way out of this\nawful place. Yong Doning was extremely\nanxious. He couldn't understand why the\ntwo of them couldn't see the little\nmonster. He waved his arms, shouting,\n\"That big tattoo on your arm. On your\nshoulder? There's a monster on your\nshoulder.\" Chapter 77. I must have my\nreasons. The tattooed man was startled\nand subconsciously looked at his\nshoulder. His expression immediately\nturned to one of utter terror. Just as\nhe was about to scream, a look of\nbewilderment appeared on his face. He\nturned to Yong Donging and asked, \"Where\nis the monster? Are you blind? It's\nright on your shoulder.\" The impatient\nYong Donging rushed over, but Su Mu\ndidn't stop him. Instead, he observed.\nHe was certain that both the tattooed\nman and the bald man were from the\nbronze coffin company because they still\ncarried traces of his mental energy.\nYong Donging swung his fist at the\nlittle monster. But just as he entered\nwithin 10 m of the little monster, a\nlook of bewilderment appeared on his\nface and he stopped in his tracks. He\nscratched his head like an idiot. Huh?\nWhat am I doing rushing over here? He\nforgot. Meanwhile, the little monster\ncontinued to eat the things it had\npulled out of the tattooed man's brain.\nBite by bite. Bang. The tattooed man\nfell straight to the ground, dying\npeacefully without any wounds on his\nbody. Young Donging and the bald man\nwere startled. What happened? Why is he\nlying on the ground? Could it be low\nblood sugar? Quickly help him up. The\ntwo men quickly tried to help the\ntattooed man up, but as soon as they\nbent down, a look of confusion flashed\nacross their faces, and they completely\nforgot what they were supposed to do.\nWhoosh! The little monster jumped onto\nthe bald man's shoulder again, its bare\narm reaching for the man's head. Upon\nseeing this, Sumu instantly understood\nthat this little monster must be the\nculprit behind their memory loss, and\nthat the fog was very likely created by\nit. Yong Doning, \"Come back!\" Sumu waved\nto Yong Doning. Yang Doning started\nwalking back, but after one step, he\nstopped and asked Sumu in a days, \"What\ndid you just say?\" Seeing this, Sumu\nimmediately pulled out his gun and fired\nat the little monster. He did not use\nall things in the world because the\nmonster had no eyes, and hypnotizing it\nwould be too far away. Bang! Bang! Bang!\nThe bullet struck the little monster\nwith perfect accuracy, knocking it off\nits shoulder. It grimaced in pain, but\nthe bullet did not penetrate its body,\nleaving only a few white marks. After\nlanding, the little monster quickly got\nup from the ground, flapped its fleshy\nwings on its back, and fled into the\ndistance. Why did you suddenly fire?\nYong Dona asked, puzzled. There was a\nmonster that could devour memories next\nto you just now. If I'm not mistaken,\nyour memories will be affected if you\nenter within 10 m of it. So, keep your\ndistance from me and don't get close.\nYang Doning&lt;unk&gt;s expression changed. A\nmonster that devours memories. How come\nI didn't see it? Can it turn invisible?\nSumu shook his head. It can't become\ninvisible, but the moment you see it,\nyou'll forget that you just saw it. In\nother words, you can only be sure that\nyou won't forget seeing it if you keep a\ndistance of 10 m from it. Yong Doning\nopened his mouth, but before he could\nsay anything, his expression suddenly\nchanged and he looked at Sumu&lt;unk&gt;s\nshoulder in shock. You? Sumu s eyes\nturned cold. Before Yong Doning could\neven remind him, the gun in his hand was\nalready pointed at his shoulder. Out of\nthe corner of his eye, he saw the little\nmonster reaching out its hand towards\nhis head. Without the slightest\nhesitation, he pressed his finger hard\non the trigger. But at that critical\nmoment, a look of confusion flashed\nacross his face, and Sumu stopped his\nfinger from pressing the trigger. Wait,\nwhat am I supposed to do next? Gun. What\nam I supposed to shoot with a gun? Why\ndid I shoot? Never mind. It's not\nimportant. I never do anything\nmeaningless. I always have my reasons.\nBang. A blazing bullet whistled out and\nstruck the little monster squarely in\nits open mouth, sending it flying. This\ntime it may have hit a vital spot as it\nwrithed on the ground in pain. Its tiny\nfleshy wings flapping desperately as it\nflew away into the distance. Sumu\ninstantly regained his senses, his hands\nas steady as precise machines, firing\ncontinuously in the direction the little\nmonster was fleeing. Although all the\nbullets hit their mark, they were unable\nto inflict any fatal damage. In the\nblink of an eye, the little monster flew\nout of everyone's sight. Walk. At his\ncommand, he led Yong Dongqing and the\nother man to run in the opposite\ndirection. That monster is really weird.\nWhat do we do now? Yong Donging asked\nSumu, who was about 10 m away as they\nsped along. Its own strength is very\nweak, and its defense is not as good as\nyour Iron Heart. But there is currently\nno solution to its unmemorable state.\nThe only way to deal with it is to rely\non long-range attack methods such as\nfive fingers flame bullet or non-living\nthings without memory. A pistol can\nrepel it, but it cannot kill it. So, the\nonly option for now is to leave.\nOtherwise, once we run out of bullets,\nwe'll be dead for sure. Sumu's eyes\ngleamed with excitement like a pro gamer\nencountering an extremely challenging\nlevel. He had almost died just now. If\nthat shot hadn't been fired, he would\nhave certainly perished. It's\nunrealistic to expect Yong Donging to\nsave them. Even if Yong Dongqing rushes\nover, he'll lose his memory once he's\nwithin 10 m and forget why he rushed\nover. Fortunately, he still fired the\ngun with absolute confidence in himself.\nHe still managed to fire the gun even\nthough he had lost his memory. Flapping\nits bare fleshy wings as it charged\ntoward them. Sumu fired his gun while\nretreating. Although he couldn't kill\nthe little monster, he could at least\nslow down its advance by relying on the\npower of his weapon. After they crossed\nthe tall hill, they immediately saw a\ndifferent view. The first thing that\ncatches the eye is a sacrificial site\nsurrounded by huge stone walls. The\nsemi-ircular stone walls are arranged in\na mysterious pattern. The walls are made\nof huge stones, the surfaces of which\nare rough and uneven, covered with\nmodeled marks and moss. Viewed from the\nhilltop, it resembles a giant eye made\nof stone walls with an open space in the\nvery center shaped like a human pupil.\nGo in and take a look, Sumu ordered.\nThis time, before he could even give any\ninstructions, Yong Donging had already\ntaken the lead and cleared the way. The\nbald man followed closely behind Sumu,\nhis expression filled with fear and his\nface covered in cold sweat. He had\ncompletely forgotten about Sumu and the\nother man, and even forgot why he was\nthere. He only knew that there was a\nmonster behind him and that he had to\nrun away as fast as he could. Strangely,\nafter the three stepped onto this land,\nthe little monster stopped in its\ntracks, seemingly wary of something, and\ndared not approach. Sumu narrowed his\neyes, realizing that there was probably\nsome danger hidden here. But no matter\nwhat danger it was, he had to find out\nbecause with his current abilities, once\nhe ran out of bullets, he would surely\ndie when facing the little monster.\nChapter 78. Sumu, bronze tier three. The\nthree of them weaved through the huge\ngaps in the stone wall, heading straight\nfor the center. Along the way, they saw\nmany ancient bronze ritual implements\nscattered on the ground. The bronze\nartifacts were very broken and rusty,\nbut Sumu did not let them go. Instead,\nhe carefully examined them. Although he\nhad never seen a treasure before, the\nbronze artifacts that appeared in such a\nstrange place might be treasures.\nHowever, noble fantasms are indeed not\nso easy to encounter. These bronze\nartifacts are at most antiques and have\nnothing to do with noble fantasms. They\ndo not contain the power of law and are\neven fragile and break easily. There's a\ncorpse here. Yong Donging, who was at\nthe front, suddenly stopped and stared\nintently at a dark humanoid object in\nthe corner. Sumu stepped forward and\npoked it with his snakeskin cane,\ndiscovering that it was indeed a human\ncorpse. The reason it was charred all\nover was because it had been burned by\nflames. They continued forward, and the\ncloser they got to the center, the more\ncorpses they encountered. Strangely,\nthese corpses died from two causes. Some\nwere burned to a crisp, while others had\nno flesh left, only piles of white\nbones. Moreover, those bones showed\nsigns of decay. Could this be some kind\nof sacrificial sight? Yong Doning&lt;unk&gt;s\nface was solemn and weary. The two\ndifferent gruesome corpses gave him a\nbad feeling. I've heard that some people\nwho believe in evil gods like to self-\nemilate to prove their piety. Could\nthose skeletons be offering their own\nflesh and blood to the evil gods? The\nbald man said, trembling. Stop. There\nare people in the center of the square.\nSumu suddenly stopped in front of a\nstone wall. Behind the stone wall was\nthe central square. He had just heard\nfaint voices, and there was more than\none person. Yong Dongqing and his\ncompanion tensed up, cautiously\napproaching the edge of the stone wall,\nintending to first assess the situation\nin the square. Three more unlucky guys\nhave arrived. No need to hide anymore.\nYou three come out. Several voices came\nfrom behind the stone wall. Seeing that\nhe had been discovered, Sumu decided to\nstop hiding and openly led the two of\nthem out from behind the stone wall. The\nview is of a spacious square surrounded\nby a ring of huge stone pillars. The\nsurface is weathered, but traces of its\nformer meticulous carving can still be\nfaintly seen. In the center, surrounded\nby stone pillars, stands an altar as\nwhite as jade, upon which sits a statue\nabout half a person's height. The people\nwho spoke earlier were leaning against\nthe stone pillar. There were eight of\nthem in total, seven men and one woman.\nEach of them had a faint murderous aura\non their face and were well equipped.\nSome carried cold weapons while others\ncarried guns. Most strikingly, all eight\npeople were injured. Three of them had\nextensive burns while the remaining five\nhad rotting limbs with the most severe\ncases even exposing their bones. \"Which\ncompany are you three from?\" A burly man\nin a tight black vest and camouflage\npants asked, staring intently at Sumu\nand his two companions. The burly man's\nleft hand was mostly rotten, and the\npale white bones were faintly visible. A\nbronze coffin, Sumu said calmly. The\nburly man frowned slightly. Another\nbronze coffin. I didn't expect a newly\nestablished small company to be able to\nrecruit so many superhumans. Again, Yong\nDonging was taken aback. You also saw\nother extraordinary individuals in\nbronze coffins. Before the burly man\ncould answer, a young tauist priest who\nwas trembling in the corner quickly\nraised his hand. Me. Me. Me too. From\nthe bronze coffin. Yong Doning looked at\nthe Tauist priest and realized that he\ndid not recognize him at all. Sumu's\neyes flickered slightly as he carefully\nexamined the young Tauist priest. He had\ndelicate features, wore a blue tauist\nrobe, and had his hair styled in a toist\nbun. He also carried an ancient long\nsword on his back. Upon seeing the long\nsword, he immediately recognized the\nother party's identity. That's right. He\nis the one from the bronze coffin.\nSumu's sudden voice delighted the\nTauist. Fellow Daist, do we know each\nother before? I didn't expect that you,\nwho came from the realm of the\nunremembered, would still recognize me.\nUnfortunately, I don't remember you at\nall now. The unrememberable one. Is that\nthe name of that little monster? Sumu\nshook his head. I don't know you. Huh?\nThe towist priest paused. Then how can\nyou be sure I'm from the bronze coffin?\nBecause you were the only one among the\npeople present who was carrying a long\nsword and I had seen sword marks on the\nmannequins in the bronze coffin training\nroom. But [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Mungley had no\nrecollection of sword marks. So I guess\nthat other people from the bronze coffin\nmust have entered the ruined city first.\nBut because of the memory loss, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\nMoonly forgot about you. What? The\ntowist priest was shocked. The boss\nactually forgot about me. I've been\nsending her flowers every day since I\njoined the company, even though she\ndidn't accept them. She can't just\nforget about me, right? Then all those\nflowers I sent were for nothing. The\ntowist priest was struck as if by a\nheavy blow and became dejected, just\nlike Yong Donging had when he was\nheartbroken. Shut up, the burly man\nroared. Nobody wants to hear your\nhistory of failed relationships. If we\ncan't figure out a way to break the\ncurse, we're all going to die. The\ntowist priest turned pale and dared not\nutter another sound, seemingly very\nafraid of the burly man. At this moment,\nthe burly man said to Sum Mu and the\nother two, \"My name is Tyongo, a bronze\nlevel three transcendent, and I belong\nto the Ling Shu company founded by the\nsecond young master of the Mong family.\nI am the strongest among those present\nand temporarily lead this hastily\nassembled team. How strong are you?\nDon't even think about hiding it. We're\nall in the same boat now.\" The moment\nyou entered this sacrificial site, you\nwere already being watched by the idols.\nNow, the only way to survive is for us\nto work together. Idol? Sumu glanced at\nthe human-shaped statue on the altar\nwithout showing any emotion. The statue\nwas very strange, half black and half\nwhite, as if it were made of two\ncompletely different pieces of material.\nThe black parts are ferocious like\ndemons, while the white parts are holy\nlike gods. Both of them have four wings\non their backs, also composed of black\nand white, which together make eight\nwings. God and demon are pieced together\ninto a hole, much like angels and fallen\nangels in mythology. Yong Donging,\nbronze tier one. Yong Donging was the\nfirst to announce his name and rank.\nHearing the name Bronze One, everyone's\nfaces immediately showed disappointment.\nClearly, they hoped to gain some\npowerful allies. The bald man stammered.\nI I'm Xiao Yong Xang, an ordinary\nperson. An ordinary person didn't die at\nthe hands of the unmemorable one. You\nhave a magical artifact. The burly man\nTyphong stared intently at Xiao Yong\nXang and asked. The tangible pressure\nmade Xiao Yong Jang tremble even more.\nHe quickly waved his hand. No, no, he\nsaved me. Typhoon followed Xiao Yong\nX&lt;unk&gt;s gaze to Sumu, his face showing\nscrutiny. Sumu smiled slightly. Sumu,\nbronze tier three. Chapter 79, idols.\nGreat, another bronze three. Maybe he\ncan find a way to break the code. The\nonly woman in the team was overjoyed,\nglancing at Sumu out of the corner of\nher eye. You say you're bronze level\nthree? Typhon looked doubtful. Kid,\nnow's not the time to lie. I don't\nbelieve a bronze coffin can attract a\nbronze level three superhuman. What is\nyour bronze law? Sumu adjusted his\ntinted glasses and said casually, \"What\nyou want to try?\" His calm tone carried\nan undeniable and powerful confidence,\nmuch like a longtime high-ranking person\nlooking down upon someone. Hump. Typhong\nsnorted coldly. Kid, I'm not afraid of\nyou. The most important thing right now\nis to lift the curse. There's no need to\ncreate unnecessary trouble. Although he\nsaid that, he couldn't hide the fear in\nhis eyes. I wonder if anyone would be\nwilling to explain the matter of the\ncurse. Sumu asked politely. The woman in\nthe crowd was about to speak when the\nTauist priest spoke first. He who had\nbeen too scared to speak by typho just\nnow seem to have found his backbone and\nstraightened his back a lot. Brother Su,\nmy name is Jun Wuang. We're one of you.\nLet me tell you, we all came here to\navoid those who can't remember. Anyone\nwho enters the sacrificial site will be\ntargeted by this statue and no one can\nleave. This angel demon statue will cast\ncurses according to good and evil. Good\npeople will see the statue completely\nturn into an angel and then be burned by\nflames. While evil people will see the\nstatue turn into a demon and then its\nbody rot. Previously, some people tried\nto attack the statue, but it was\ncompletely useless. Even Mr. Iron Peak,\na bronze 3 expert, couldn't leave a\nsingle mark on it. We could only watch\nhelplessly as we were slowly burned to\ndeath or rotted away. As Jun Wuang\nspoke, he lifted his towist robe,\nrevealing his mostly decaying body. Sumu\nraised an eyebrow slightly. How can a\nstatue distinguish between good and\nevil? curses based on good and evil. He\nfound it somewhat inexplicable because\nthe standards for good and evil were\ndifficult to judge. In the eyes of ants,\nhumans were all bad people who trampled\ntheir fellow ants to death for no reason\nevery day. The statue will ask you\nquestions and judge your good or evil\nbased on your answers. Remember, you\nmust never lie or the statue will kill\nyou. When will it ask the question? As\nlong as you get close to the statue, it\nwill come to life and ask you questions.\nYong Dong&lt;unk&gt;s eyes lit up as he\ndiscovered a way to break the deadlock.\nIf I don't go over there, won't I avoid\nthe curse? Tyong sneered. Do you think\nyou're the only smart one and we're all\nfools? I told you before, everyone who\nenters the sacrificial site has been\ntargeted by the statue. If you don't\napproach the statue to answer questions\nfor a long time, you'll offend both the\nangels and the devil, and your body will\nbe burned and rotten. Yong Dong&lt;unk&gt;s\nface stiffened and he was a little\nangry, but he couldn't beat the other\nperson in a fight or argue with him.\nInstead of going directly to the statue,\nSumu asked a question. Are you all\naffiliated with companies founded by the\nMorong family? Typhoon pointed to the\ntwo people next to him. We are from Ling\nShu Company and the others over there\nare from Ling Yao Company, founded by\nthe fourth young lady of the Mong\nfamily. As for you, I don't need to\nexplain, right? Bronze Coffin, the\nnominal third young lady of the Morong\nfamily. He didn't mention the words\nillegitimate daughter, clearly still\nhaving some reservations about Su\nMu&lt;unk&gt;s bronze rank three strength. So,\nyou've all come here to find the golden\neye? Everyone nodded with varying\nexpressions. If it weren't for the\ngolden eye, who would bother coming to a\ngod-forsaken place like the abandoned\ncity? Typhong scoffed. Suddenly, Sumu\nsmiled. It seems there is no Golden Eye\nhere. Everyone was stunned for a moment\nand Typhong asked anxiously. What do you\nmean by that? How do you know there\naren't any here? Where did you learn\nabout the golden eye? Why should I tell\nyou? Tyong asked wearily. Sumu smiled\nslightly. Then I'll guess your company\nprobably gets all the golden leaves from\nscavengers, right? Upon hearing this,\nthe people from Ling Shu and Ling Yao\ncompany changed color simultaneously.\nThe two groups exchanged glances,\nclearly realizing that something was a\nmess. Typhoon persisted. So what? The\ngolden tree must have lost more than one\nleaf. Isn't it normal for many\nscavengers to have picked them up? This\nonly proves that there is a golden eye\nhere. Sumu side, his gaze behind his\nbrown glasses as if you were looking at\nan idiot. If what you said is true, then\nthere should be more companies that know\nabout the golden eye, not just the Mong\nfamily. Haven't you ever thought about\nwhy it's all the Mong family companies\nthat come here? And all the companies\nare there except for the one owned by\nthe eldest son of the Morong family.\nThis could it be that? The group\nexchanged glances, all seeing the\nemotion on each other's faces. They\nweren't fools, but being cursed made it\ndifficult for them to think calmly.\nTheir minds were filled with thoughts of\nthe curse. Now, after Sumu's prompting,\nthey immediately realized something was\nwrong. You mean this was a trap set by\nthe eldest young master of the Mong\nfamily? Typhong suddenly stood up,\nletting out a painful groan as he\nclutched his rotting left arm, clearly\naggravating the wound. Maybe, but it\ndoesn't matter. Sumu shrugged\nindifferently. In fact, he was more\ninclined to believe that Murung Mungly\nsiance was also involved since Hanu\nhadn't appeared at all. It doesn't\nmatter to him who the mastermind is. He\nnever cares about evidence when it comes\nto revenge. He kills all the suspects\nand there will always be a real enemy\ninvolved. He really liked the surprise\nthe other person gave him and decided to\nreciprocate in the future. The crowd's\nfaces turned extremely ugly. Having been\ntricked into this state, it was hard for\nanyone not to feel resentment. Next\nquestion. After you entered the\nsacrificial site, did the unremembered\nones reappear? Perhaps out of confidence\nin Sum Mu&lt;unk&gt;s strength and\nintelligence. Even Typho didn't cause\nany trouble this time and said directly,\n\"No, those who cannot remember are\nprobably afraid of the statue and dare\nnot enter its range.\" Sumu nodded\nthoughtfully. It seemed that this statue\nwas even more bizarre than the\nunmemorable one. But why would the\nmastermind behind it all put two\nmutually restraining things in the\nabandoned city? The statue is so bizarre\nthat it can trap all the extraordinary\nbeings here, leaving them with no choice\nbut to wait for death. Logically\nspeaking, the mastermind behind it\nshould only need to send out the statue.\nThere is no need to create another\nperson with no memory. Unless the statue\nwasn't created by the mastermind behind\nit, but was already there. Chapter 80.\nIf you are a god, then what am I? After\nroughly understanding the cause and\neffect, Sumu gestured to the bald man\nXiao Yong Xang. Under the influence of\nhypnosis, Xiao Yong Xang resolutely\nstepped into the area covered by the\nstatue. Xiao Yong Xang&lt;unk&gt;s actions\nimmediately attracted everyone's\nattention. They seemed to be extremely\nafraid of the statue. When they saw\nsomeone step into the area covered by\nthe statue, they all endured the pain\nand got up, constantly retreating. When\nXiao Yong Xang stepped about 10 m away\nfrom the statue, click, click, click.\nThe sound of stones rubbing together\nrang out, and the head of the\nhalfhumansized god demon statue slowly\nturned to face Zia. Its black and white\neyes seemed to come alive at this\nmoment, turning slightly and staring\nstraight at the living person in front\nof it. A terrifying pressure descended\nat that moment, and the surrounding\nspace froze. The feeling was\nindescribable, as if one had suddenly\nbeen placed in the deep sea at a depth\nof 10,000 m, surrounded by writhing\ndarkness, suffocating, cold, and\ndesperate thump. Under this terrifying\npressure, Xiao Yong Xang actually knelt\ndown on the ground, his face pale and\nhis body trembling, almost collapsing\nfrom exhaustion. Sumu narrowed his eyes.\nHe had just hypnotized Xiao Yong Xang to\nrelieve his fear. But when faced with\nthe statue, the overwhelming fear\novercame the hypnosis. Mortal, tell me\nthe most wicked things you have done. A\ndeep, sinister voice and a cold, grand\nvoice rang out simultaneously. They were\ntwo completely different voices, as if\nan angel and a demon were speaking. When\nthe statue spoke, the extraordinary\nbeings were all terrified, not daring to\neven breathe, and hid behind the pillars\nto watch. I, Ziao Yong, trembled even\nmore, his words becoming increasingly\nfragmented. I embezzled money from my\nprevious company and framed someone\nelse. Buzz. with a strange buzzing\nsound. The statue slowly fell silent and\nthe terrifying pressure dissipated\ncompletely. What followed was Xiao Yong\nXian&lt;unk&gt;s scream. \"Uh, my leg.\" He\nscreamed and frantically tried to pull\nup his trouser leg to see that the flesh\non his right calf was beginning to rot.\n\"He has been cursed by a demon,\" Typhong\nsaid in a low voice. A hint of confusion\nin his tone. \"Among our sins, his\nembezzlement of public funds is the\nleast serious. I thought he would be\ncursed by angels, but I never expected\nhim to be a devil. Who knows? Maybe in\nthe eyes of angels, embezzling public\nfunds is considered betrayal and\ntherefore not kindness. Oh. Suddenly,\nanother scream rang out, this time from\nYong Doning. Yong Doning was seen\nclutching his left hand with a pained\nexpression. Three of his fingers were\nslowly rotting while the other two\nfingers seemed to be burned by invisible\nflames, their skin turning black. Wuang,\nalso from the bronze coffin company,\nhurriedly reminded him. Yong Donging\ngritted his teeth and enduring the\nexcruciating pain, rushed toward the\nstatue. Then the statue came to life\nagain and looked at Yong Doning. The\nyoung man with a body of steel\nimmediately felt a terrifying pressure\nlike a dark mountain pressing down on\nhim. He tried to grit his teeth and\npersevere, but he was defeated after\nonly a few seconds and knelt down\nstraight in front of the statue. Mortal,\ntell me the most wicked things you have\ndone. It's still the same problem. Yong\nDoning was in a dilemma because he was\nunsure which of the three things was\ntruly evil. He thought about killing\npeople, including many members of the\npoisonous snake gang, but he didn't\nthink that was evil. Sumu had clearly\ncommitted the crime first by taking\nJasmine away, and the members of the\npoisonous snake gang were all scum, so\ntheir deaths were not unjust. After a\nmoment's thought, Yong Donging raised\nhis head with difficulty and said,\n\"Robbery, I robbed 50,000 yuan. Buzz.\"\nAn eerie buzzing sound rang out. The\nstatue began to change in Yong Don&lt;unk&gt;s\neyes. The statue, which was originally\nhalf god and half demon, began to turn\nblack rapidly and completely transformed\ninto the appearance of a ferocious\ndemon. At the same time, the burns on\nhis palms disappeared rapidly, replaced\nby the rotting of his entire palm.\nanother demon. Jun Wuang exclaimed,\n\"This is too ridiculous. Stealing 50,000\nyuan makes you a demon.\" This woman\nwiped out her enemy's entire family for\nrevenge, not even sparing the children.\nYet, she received an angelic curse. The\nwoman who was called out turned cold and\nsneered. It's only right that a life\nshould be paid for a life. What's wrong\nwith me taking revenge? Look at\nyourself. The worst thing you've ever\ndone is not paying for a foot massage.\nYou're already labeled a demon and you\nstill have the nerve to talk about\nothers. Jun Wu Shang blushed\nimmediately, clearly embarrassed that\nhis secret had been exposed. I forgot to\nbring my money.\" Tai Fangs gaze swept\nover the group, and he said in a deep\nvoice, \"Something is definitely not\nright. Is the standard of judgment\nreally good and evil? Is robbery a\ngreater crime than murder?\" Could it be\nbecause Jun Wu Shang is a Tauist priest\nand his actions are considered a\nviolation of the Tao he believes in. So\nit doesn't matter how serious the\nincident is, but it still counted as\nbetrayal. A short Finn man pondered.\nPossibly Typhoon couldn't figure it out\neither, so he could only reluctantly\naccept this explanation. At this moment,\neveryone's attention was focused on the\nlast person, Sumu. Some people wondered\nin surprise, he hasn't answered any\nquestions for so long. Why hasn't he\nbeen cursed by gods or demons? Everyone\nnoticed the problem. Sumu and Yong\nDonging arrived at the same time and\nlogically they should have suffered the\ndual curse of gods and demons at the\nsame time. However, only Yong Doning was\ncursed while Sumu seemed to be unharmed.\nHe must have been cursed. The wound\nshould be covered by his clothes. He\nprobably has a high pain tolerance. So,\nhe didn't show any abnormalities.\nHearing the discussions, Sumu smiled\nslightly and did not explain. He was not\nactually cursed. He had vaguely felt two\nstrange forces invading his body, but\nthey were blocked by the immaculate\nheart. The passive effect of innocent\nheart is that it provides strong\nresistance to various forms of filth and\nnegativity. However, he still chose to\nwalk towards the statue because he could\nfeel that as time went by, the two\nstrange forces were getting stronger and\nstronger, and it wouldn't be long before\nthey broke through the upper limit that\nthe immaculate heart could withstand. To\navoid being afflicted by both curses,\none can only answer the questions posed\nby the idol. Click, click, click. As\nSumu entered, the head of the statue\nbegan to turn, and the terrifying\npressure descended once again. The\nfeeling of fear and despair, as if\nfalling into the deep sea, surged into\nhis heart. It was not so obvious when he\nwas far away, but now that he was being\nwatched by the statue, the feeling was\nespecially strong. It's as if a real god\nor demon is standing in front of you.\nTheir majestic bodies piercing the sky\nand standing shoulder-to-shoulder with\nthe planets. The intense sense of\noppression is enough to suffocate you.\nHowever, just when everyone thought Sumu\nwould kneel down as they had before,\nthey found him smiling, a smile that was\ncalm and even carried a hint of\ncontempt. His figure was as upright as a\npine tree, and his gaze was calm and\npeaceful, as if he did not feel the\npressure from gods and demons. Sumu\nsmiled gently, his lips barely moving as\nhe silently asked the statue. If you are\na god, then what am I? The statue fell\nsilent as if it were a lifeless object.\nChapter 81. I once destroyed a city out\nof boredom. How is this possible? Typhon\nlooked shocked. Even as a third tier\nbronze saint, he couldn't withstand the\npressure of the statue. Sumu was also a\nthird tier bronze saint. So, how could\nhe? Could it be that Sumu's strength far\nsurpasses his own? At this moment, he\nhad no doubt about Sum Mu&lt;unk&gt;s strength\nanymore, and was even extremely wary of\nhim. What he didn't know was that Sumu\nwasn't even a bronze 3, let alone a\nbronze 2 in the strictest sense. I've\nseen plenty of gods like you. Go ahead\nand ask. Sumu pushed up his brown tinted\nglasses, his lips moving silently as he\nurged the statue. He wasn't lying. In\nthe dream, someone of his caliber\nwouldn't even be qualified to step into\nthe celestial palace and pay homage to\nhim. After a long silence, the statue\nfinally asked the question mechanically.\nTell me the most heinous things you have\ndone. Murder, Sumu said calmly. Brother\nSu, that won't do. Many of them have\nkilled people. You need to tell us how\nmany they killed and why they killed\nthem. Jun Wuang shouted from afar. Sumu\nthought for a moment and then changed\nhis words. I once destroyed a city out\nof boredom. I don't know how many people\nwere destroyed, but there must have been\nmillions. After he casually uttered\nthose words, the entire sacrificial site\nfell into an eerie silence. In the\ndistance, Typhong and the others stared\nat him in disbelief. Their faces filled\nwith disbelief. They even doubted their\nown ears. Destroying a city out of\nboredom. Millions of people. We've never\nkilled that many people, even in a game.\nBrother Su, don't lie. The statue will\nkill those who lie. Jun Wuang shouted\nanxiously, fearing that the statue would\ncome to life and be killed by Sum Mu at\nany moment. However, his fears did not\ncome true. Buzz. An eerie buzzing sound\nrang out, and the statue fell silent.\nGod statue this. This Jun Wuang was now\nincoherent, and his body even began to\ntremble slightly. Wait a minute. Let me\nsort this out. You can't lie in front of\nthe statue or you'll be killed. Brother\nSu said he once destroyed a city. He he\nJun Wuang couldn't continue. He looked\nat Su Mu, who was smiling and dressed in\na suit and tie, looking as elegant as an\naristocrat. For some reason, he felt a\nstrange sense of terror sweep over his\nbody, and his scalp tingled. Suddenly,\nSumu frowned slightly. He felt a burning\npain on his left arm, which was covered\nby his clothes. At the same time, the\nstatue in his eyes changed. It was no\nlonger a dual image of God and demon,\nbut became as white as jade and was\ncompletely a statue of a holy angel. He\nalso saw the angel's full appearance. It\nhad eight wings on its back, three eyes,\nand silver vertical pupils on its\nforehead. An angel? As expected, he had\nroughly understood the principle behind\nthe curse cast by the statues of gods\nand demons. It was not about good or\nevil. He slowly walked out of the\nstatue's enclosure and tore the crowd.\nBut as he approached, everyone took a\nstep back in unison, their expressions\ntense as if facing a formidable enemy,\nlooking as if they were looking at a\ndemon king about to destroy the world.\nTyphon was extremely nervous. This Sumu\nwas definitely lying. He was nothing but\nbronze three. This guy was silver three,\ndestroying a city. He had thought that\nhe had done some dirty work for the\nnobles and killed hundreds of people,\nwhich was already unforgivable. But now\ncompared to Sumu, he felt that he should\nbe cursed by angels, not demons. Sumu,\nyou you really destroyed a city? Yang\nDoning asked with a complicated\nexpression. Sumu smiled slightly. Of\ncourse, it's fake. Do you know how\ntroublesome it is to destroy a city? For\na medium-sized city, if you use\nexplosives, you would need at least\n879.35\ntons, provided that there are no\nmilitary buildings such as air raid\nshelters in the city. Otherwise, you\nwould need even more. call. Yong Donging\nbreathed a sigh of relief. I knew it was\nimpossible. Typhoon and the others were\nspeechless. They even wanted to slap\nYong Donging to bring him to his senses.\nDidn't they hear that the amount of\nexplosives was accurate to the decimal\npoint? Furthermore, you cannot lie in\nfront of a statue of a god. At this\nmoment, Yong Doning seemed to remember\nsomething. Wait a minute. Isn't it\nforbidden to lie in front of a statue of\na god? Sumu shrugged. Who knows? Maybe\nit's broken. After all, even lie\ndetectors can fail sometimes, let alone\na pile of rocks. That's true. Yong\nDonging nodded in realization. Are you\nnodding? You actually believe this kind\nof lie? Typhoon watched as Yong\nDong&lt;unk&gt;ing eyelids twitched. He\nfinally understood why Yong Dongqing\ncould follow this murderous tyrant. It\nturned out he was a fool, so he wasn't\nafraid. In fact, Sumu wasn't lying. He\noften set off the entire city when he\nwas bored in his dreams. Then everyone\nfell silent and the atmosphere became\nvery subtle. Everyone kept their\ndistance from Sumu as if they were\navoiding some terrifying monster except\nfor the hotheaded Yong Donging. What do\nwe do next? We're&lt;unk&gt; all under a curse\nnow? Yong Donging habitually turned his\ngaze to Sumu. Oh right, I almost forgot\nto ask. Are you cursed by an angel or a\ndemon? Demons, Sumu said without\nchanging his expression. He lied again\nbecause among the people present, only\nthree were cursed by angels and the rest\nwere demons. Although he didn't know\nwhat this meant, he habitually put\nhimself in the group with the most\npeople. Anyway, the burn marks were\ncovered by his clothes, and no one dared\nto lift his clothes to verify, so he\ncould say whatever he wanted. Everyone\nincreasingly felt that Yong Donging was\nan idiot. He had destroyed an entire\ncity. What else could he be but a demon?\nSumu's gaze slowly swept over everyone\npresent. Sensing his gaze, everyone\nlooked away and not one dared to meet\nhis eyes. Finally, his gaze fell on the\nwoman who was cursed by the angel. The\nwoman was in very bad condition with\npain flashing across her face from time\nto time. Her exposed neck, thighs, and\narms were covered with burns, and the\nburns were slowly spreading, almost\nreaching her face. Clearly, this woman\nwill be the first victim. He walked to\nthe side, leaned his tall body against a\nstone pillar, and pondered a solution.\nWith so little information available,\neven he couldn't immediately find a way\nto break the curse. However, he had a\nvague suspicion that it might not be a\ncurse at all. But he needed time to\nverify it. Time passed slowly, and the\natmosphere among the people became\nincreasingly oppressive. No one liked\nthe feeling that life was continuing to\nmove towards its end. I can't take it\nanymore. The woman suddenly roared in\npain, stood up, and said to the crowd,\n\"I'm about to die, and you won't live\nmuch longer either. Rather than waiting\nto die, we might as well fight the idol.\nChapter 82. Mr. Su has made his move.\nFight. Tyong sneered. I'm only half a\nstep away from connecting with the\nsilver law. Power servant. Even with my\nfull strength, I couldn't harm the\nstatue in the slightest. What do I have\nto fight with? What else can we do? Wait\nto die? The woman's taught nerves\nfinally snapped under the pressure of\ndeath. She screamed hysterically, her\nexpression becoming increasingly\nfrantic. Suddenly, the woman seemed to\nremember something and looked at Su Mu\nwith excitement and pleading in her\neyes. Mr. Sue, with your strength, you\ncan definitely shatter the statue. You\nare a powerful figure who can destroy a\ncity. As if grasping at a last straw,\nher eyes were filled with pleading. Mr.\nSue, please help me quickly. As long as\nyou can break the curse, I will\ndefinitely repay you in the future. You\ncan have anything I have, even if it\nmeans becoming my slave. Horrific burns\nhad crept onto the woman's face. And\nthis extraordinary individual showed no\ndifference from an ordinary person when\nfacing death. Some say that death is the\nfairest thing in the world, and Sumu\nagrees. The woman's words gave everyone\na glimmer of hope. Perhaps this powerful\nfigure who had once destroyed a city\ncould truly do it. Typho carefully\nconsidered his words. Mr. Sue, how about\nwe trouble you to give it a try? Faced\nwith everyone's sincere requests, Sumu\nnaturally did not refuse. He nodded\ncalmly like a peerless expert who had\nfinally agreed to come out of seclusion\nto save the world. Everyone stepped back\nto avoid accidental injury. Everyone was\noverjoyed and obediently retreated,\nwalking a full hundred meters before Su\nMu told them to stop. Everyone was even\nmore eager to see what kind of powerful\nattack Mr. Su would use that would\nrequire us to retreat 100 m. Only Yong\nDoning looked puzzled. Could it be that\nSumu, this sickly fellow, really had\nsome powerful attack methods hidden?\nThat shouldn't be the case. He just\ncaptured me not long ago and questioned\nme about the extraordinary. In the\nnightmare world, he relied entirely on\nhis underlings and my protection.\nAlthough Sumu was the one who broke the\nnightmare world in the end, I didn't see\nhim show any strength from beginning to\nend. Amidst the expectant gazes of the\ncrowd, Sumu slowly extended a finger and\nall things in the universe was instantly\nactivated. Just as everyone was\nwondering why Mr. Sue was pointing to\nthe sky with one finger, suddenly it got\ndark. Everyone looked up in horror and\nsaw that a huge dark cloud had suddenly\nappeared in the sky above the\nsacrificial site, stretching for\nthousands of meters and enveloping the\nentire sacrificial site. The thick dark\nclouds rolled endlessly like surging\nblack waves. Changed the heavens with\nhis own power. You're telling me he's a\nbronze 3? Jun Wuang was dumbfounded. And\nthe others were also shocked. Even the\nstrongest typho was the same. As a\nbronze 3, he follows the path of a\ncommoner superhuman, the power servant,\npossessing three bronze laws. Iron\nheart, mighty fist, and unending\nrecovery. His fighting prowess is\nnothing more than that of a humanoid\nTyrannosaurus Rex, using his fists and\nfeet to crush his opponents. Now looking\nat Sumu, who is also at the bronze 3\nlevel, he can change the celestial\nphenomena with just one finger. They are\nnot on the same level at all. This gives\nTypho the illusion that a martial artist\nis facing a cultivator. Suddenly, from\nthe depths of the thick, impenetrable\nclouds, a dazzling golden light flashed.\nThen to everyone's astonishment, a\nmassive golden sword as large as a\nmountain peak slowly emerged like a\nsword of judgment from the heavens. The\ngolden celestial sword was surrounded by\ndazzling light within which countless\nstars seemed to twinkle and mysterious\nrunes seemed to flow. The moment\neveryone saw the golden celestial sword,\ntheir minds went blank and they were so\nshocked that they were speechless. What\nkind of law is this? How can it be so\nterrifying? At this moment, Sum moves\noutstretched, jade-like fingers slightly\nlowered, and the heavenly sword in the\nsky seemed to receive some kind of\nsignal, suddenly falling with the force\nof a thunderbolt. The terrifying aura\nterrified everyone, and they fled in\npanic. Although they knew the heavenly\nsword wasn't aimed at them, they still\ninstinctively wanted to escape. Only the\ndying woman was incredibly excited, her\neyes reflecting the golden light of the\nheavenly sword and her desire for life.\nShe clenched her fists with Mr. pursue\nstrength, he can definitely do it.\nHowever, things in life rarely go as\nplanned. Just as the heavenly sword\nfell, a jet black demonic light suddenly\nerupted from the statue of gods and\ndemons. The black light shot out and\nlanded in midair, instantly transforming\ninto a bottomless black hole, like the\ngaping m of a giant abyss beast, which\nswallowed the heavenly sword in one\ngulp. The dark clouds in the sky slowly\ndissipated and the black hole\ndisappeared as well as if nothing had\never happened. Sumu shook his head at\neveryone. My strength is still too weak\nto deal with the idol. The stunned crowd\ndidn't dare to reply. You call this\nweakness? Do you have some\nmisunderstanding about the definition of\nweakness? Typho forced a smile which was\ntinged with flattery. Mr. Sue, you are\njoking. When we attacked the statue, we\ncouldn't even elicit a reaction from it.\nBut you made a move that caused the\nstatue to retaliate. I'm not\nexaggerating when I say that. To date, I\nhave never seen a superhuman more\npowerful than you. No one thought there\nwas anything wrong with Tai Fangs change\nfrom arrogance to obsequiousness. This\nwas a normal reaction when facing a\nstrong person, especially since he had\nspoken rudely before. The fact that he\ndidn't kneel down to apologize now was\nsimply because he saw that Sumu didn't\ncare too much about what had happened\nbefore. Sumu smiled and nodded. a hint\nof helplessness in his smile as if he\nwas troubled by his inability to destroy\nthe statue. In truth, only he knows his\nreal thoughts. He was acting the whole\nthing. The heavenly sword and the black\nhole were all illusions conjured by the\nmyriad manifestations of the universe.\nHe never attacked the statue and the\nstatue never reacted. It was all for\nshell. Even Iron Peak, a bronze 3\nwarrior, couldn't damage the statue, let\nalone him. It's not surprising that\npeople do anything under the pressure of\ndeath, let alone a group of\nextraordinary individuals. Therefore, he\nmust establish an absolute position of\nstrength, not only to ensure his own\nsafety, but also to better lead the\ngroup and increase the success rate of\nbreaking the deadlock. To say there was\nno attack wouldn't be entirely accurate.\nHe had just tried to control the statue\nwith his mental power, but failed, as if\nthe statue were just an ordinary stone.\nAmong the crowd, a short, dark-skinned\nman stared intently at Sum Mu with a\nhint of doubt in his eyes, as if he had\nnoticed something. Ah! A shrill scream\ndrew everyone's attention. The woman\nwith the most serious injuries had\ncollapsed to the ground, rolling around\nfrantically. Horrible burns had spread\nall over her body. Strangely, no one\ncould see the flames on her body.\nMoments later, the screams subsided, and\nthe woman turned into a charred corpse.\nChapter 83. Methods to break the curse.\nThe woman's death cast a shadow over\neveryone's hearts, especially after\nwitnessing that even a terrifyingly\npowerful figure like Sumu was unable to\ndestroy the statue. Besides the woman\nand Sumu, there were two other people\npresent who were cursed by the angels\nand had burn marks on their skin. As\nthey looked at the woman's miserable\ndeath, their faces grew increasingly\ngrim, as if they could already see what\nwould happen to them soon. Huh, my\nrotting seems to be getting better.\nTauist Jun Wuang suddenly lifted his\nTauist robe, revealing his long rotting\nbelly. His belly, which was originally\ncompletely rotten, had now recovered\nquite a bit, and the rotten parts had\nshrunk by a whole size. Everyone quickly\nchecked themselves. Mine, too. The\nrotten part has shrunk a whole size. Me,\ntoo. My whole leg was rotting just now,\nbut my thigh is healed now. Only my calf\nis rotting. What exactly happened? Jun\nWuang asked in surprise. Did Mr.\nSu&lt;unk&gt;s attack just now take effect?\nWait a minute. Why aren't my burns\ngetting better? Mine didn't get any\nbetter. In fact, it got worse. Sumu\nnarrowed his eyes, observing the changes\nin everyone, and already understood the\nprinciple behind the curse. He carefully\nobserved the expressions of the crowd\nand found that several people had\nalready realized what was happening. The\ntwo men, both afflicted by the angelic\ncurse, exchanged a glance, seemingly\nrealizing something. Their expressions\nsuddenly changed drastically, but they\nquickly concealed their emotions and\nbegan to communicate subtly with their\neyes, occasionally glancing at the man\nafflicted by the demonic curse, who was\necstatic. Their reaction was quick, but\nsomeone else reacted even faster. Boom!\nA pair of metallic fists suddenly\nappeared behind one of the men's heads.\nBang! The man didn't even have time to\nreact before his head exploded, leaving\nhim a headless corpse lying on the\nground. The remaining person's\nexpression changed drastically. Typhong.\nBefore he could finish speaking, a gust\nof evil wind swept in from his right,\nand the one who made the move was the\nshort, dark-skinned man. The short man's\nright hand had somehow transformed into\na tiger's claw covered in red and black\nfur. Its sharp nails gleamed with a cold\nlight, and with a single strike, it tore\noff most of the flesh from the man's\nneck, causing blood to gush out\ninstantly. The man's eyes widened in\nanger, but he couldn't utter a single\nword before finally collapsing heavily\nto the ground. Attacked by Typho and the\nshort man shocked everyone. They quickly\ndistanced themselves from the two, their\nfaces showing shock and anger. Typho\ntuan, what are you two doing? Why did\nyou kill someone?\" someone shouted. The\ncrowd stared at the two men as if they\nwould attack them if they couldn't give\na reasonable answer. Tyong sneered.\nFool, look at your own rotting body\nbefore you ask questions. The crowd's\nexpressions changed slightly, and some\nbegan to examine the decay on their\nbodies. My decay has lessened again.\nThis time, it's reduced by more than\nhalf, and it's still slowly recovering.\nWhat on earth is going on? Why would\ntheir death cure our curse? Could it be?\nSome intelligent people had already\nrealized the crux of the problem and\nstared intently at the corpse on the\nground. Snap, snap, snap. A round of\napplause rang out from not far away, and\nSumu walked over with an approving look\non his face. You two are truly admirable\nfor your decisiveness. The moment you\ndiscovered the method to break the\ncurse, you didn't hesitate at all and\ndirectly killed them unexpectedly.\nBrilliant. Upon seeing that it was Su Mu\nwho spoke, Tying&lt;unk&gt;s fierce expression\nvanished completely and he transformed\nfrom a tiger into a kitten. His face\nfull of flattery. Mr. Su, you flatter\nme. I was only trying to help everyone\nbreak the curse. These two are quite\nstrong. If we let them launch a sneak\nattack first, we might have even more\npeople killed or injured. Sumu, what\nexactly happened? Yong Dong walked over\nwith a grim expression. He couldn't\naccept that the people who were just\nteammates had suddenly turned on each\nother. Sumu smiled slightly and\nexplained, \"Angels and demons are\ninherently opposed. This statue is a\ndual representation of gods and demons,\nand they have achieved a delicate\nbalance, making it impossible to\ndetermine a winner. This is where\nexternal force is needed. In reality,\nthe so-called curse is merely a division\nof factions. Those afflicted by the\nangel's curse are followers of the\nangel, while those unaffected are\nfollowers of the demon. I suspect that\nangels and demons use this method to\ndetermine the victor, forcing their\nrespective factions to fight each other\nthrough curses. A look of understanding\nflashed in Yong Donging&lt;unk&gt;s eyes, but\nhis face remained grim. So, that's how\nit is. But these angels and demons are\nno good either. They're so cruel. Wait,\nsomething's not right. The short man\nnamed Siakuan suddenly cried out and\nlifted his clothes, revealing a rotting\npatch on his chest. Why hasn't the decay\ncompletely disappeared? They've clearly\nkilled all the angel followers. Typhoon\nwas also shocked to find that he was in\nthe same situation with only one last\npiece of decay remaining. This can't be.\nIsn't this the way to break the curse?\nThe faces of the people who were\noriginally immersed in joy turned gloomy\nagain. Sumu frowned and walked up to the\ncrowd. The method to break the curse\nshould be correct. Since the curse has\nnot completely disappeared, there is\nonly one possibility. What's possible?\nSomeone asked eagerly. There are still\nangel believers among us. Sumu's eyes\nswept across the crowd like lightning,\nas if searching for the last angel\nbeliever. Upon hearing this, everyone\nwas shocked. They all looked at the\npeople around them with suspicion. And\nsome cautious people even quietly\nstepped back and distanced themselves\nfrom the others. How is this possible,\nMr. Sue? Everyone present should be a\nfollower of the devil. Typhon was\nstunned and could hardly believe it.\nSumu's expression grew increasingly\ngrave. Perhaps one of us is lying. He is\na believer in angels, but deliberately\nlied about being cursed by a demon.\nTyangs expression changed, and his\nmurderous gaze fixed on everyone except\nSumu. Who? Who's lying? Step forward\nnow, or I might leave you with a whole\ncorpse. Everyone, show your wounds.\nTypho, go check them. Sumu commanded in\nan unquestionable tone. Under the\npressure of the powerful figure,\neveryone lifted their clothes, revealing\nthe last small patch of decay on their\nbodies. Typhong examined them one by one\nwith his sharp hawk-like eyes and found\nthat everyone had decay, which meant\nthat they were undoubtedly believers in\nthe devil. No, Mr. Su, they are all\ndemons. Tyangs words suddenly stopped,\nhis pupils contracted sharply, and he\nlooked at Su Mu in disbelief,\nsubconsciously taking a step back. Not\nonly did he realize it, but everyone\nelse did too. Looking at Sumu in horror\nand retreating continuously, Sumu\nrequested to be inspected, but no one\ninspected Sumu from beginning to end.\nChapter 84. Typho, you still say you're\nnot a believer in angels. Mr. Suyu,\nTying&lt;unk&gt;s expression changed\ndrastically, and he didn't even dare to\nsay the next words. If Sumu was an angel\nbeliever, would he and his demon\nbelievers still be alive? Facing the\nfearful and suspicious gazes of the\ncrowd, Sumu smiled slightly. If I were a\nbeliever in angels, would I have\nadvocated for the inspection of everyone\nand even suggested that there might\nstill be believers and angels alive.\nAfter saying that, he gently lifted the\nsleeve of his left arm, revealing his\narm, where a small piece of rotting\nflesh remained on his forearm. Upon\nseeing this, everyone breathed a sigh of\nrelief. If Sumu were a believer in\nangels, they didn't think they could\nkill him. But if it wasn't Sumu, then\nwho was that angel believer? Typhong,\nyou just checked everyone's wounds. Now\nlet everyone see yours too, Sumu\nsuddenly said. Typhoon nodded and said\nrespectfully, \"Yes, Mr. Su.\" He verbally\nagreed, but inwardly he was complaining\nabout Sumu&lt;unk&gt;s unnecessary actions.\nAmong everyone, he was the one wearing\nthe most revealing clothes, a tight\nblack vest that exposed his arms and\nchest muscles. When he was rotting, his\nclothes couldn't cover it at all, and\neveryone had seen it. But since Sumu had\nspoken, he didn't dare to disobey. He\nthen boldly lifted his tight black vest,\nturned around, and revealed the wound on\nhis back. You all saw that, right? I'm a\nfollower of the devil, just like you.\nTyphoon casually put down his black\nvest, turning around as he said. It\nseems that to break the curse, besides\nkilling the angel followers, there must\nbe other hidden conditions. What's with\nthat expression on your faces? Turning\naround, Typho was startled. He found\neveryone staring intently at him. Their\nexpression strange shock, anger,\nsuspicion. His heart skipped a beat, and\na bad premonition began to rise within\nhim. \"Wait! Sunfire chains!\" a\nmiddle-aged man in a leather jacket\nshouted. A chain made of lava suddenly\nappeared in his hand and instantly\nwrapped around Tyang&lt;unk&gt;s body. Typhoon\nwas shocked, \"What do you want to do?\nI'm a follower of the devil, one of our\nown. Still trying to lie? You clearly\nhave burns on your back. You're talking\nnonsense, Mr. Sue. You have to believe\nme. I really am a follower of the devil.\nEveryone saw it when I was rotting.\nTyphoon struggled violently, his body\nturning metallic. He anxiously explained\nto Sumu, his face filled with the words,\n\"Innocent.\" Sumu knew, \"Of course, that\nTypho was innocent.\" After all, only\nthose who have wronged you truly know\nhow wrong you are. Tyongo is not a\nbeliever in angels because he is one\nhimself and the burns on his back are an\nillusion he created using the all things\nin the world. Mr. Tai, perhaps you were\na believer in demons before, but you\nchanged sides halfway through. Angels\nrepresent goodness. And perhaps it was\nyour act of stepping forward to help\neveryone break the curse that turned you\ninto a believer in angels. You don't\nneed to explain anymore. Saying more\nwon't help. After all, the burns on your\nback can't lie. Sumu sighed softly, as\nif he felt sorry for Typho. Typho was\nstunned by these words. \"You can switch\nsides, but I just killed someone to save\nmy own life. Kill him quickly. I can't\nhold on much longer.\" The man in the\nleather jacket shouted anxiously. The\nothers then launched their attack\nsurrounding Typho. Jun Wuang drew his\nlong sword and shouted, \"Pearless sword\ndance.\" The gleaming sword light, like a\nstreak of lightning, sliced through the\nair and stabbed fiercely towards Tyangs\neyeballs. He knew that his opponent\npossessed a body of steel, so he aimed\nto attack his eyes. Ah! Facing the\nonslaught of the crowd, Typho roared\nfuriously, his body radiating more and\nmore metallic light, and his muscles\nswelled up like an inflating balloon.\nBang! The flaming sun chains snapped\ninstantly. However, Typho, who had\nescaped, did not retaliate. Instead, he\nglanced at Su Mu with great apprehension\nbefore quickly fleeing. He knew clearly\nthat with Sum Mu in the demon camp, he\nas an angel believer had no chance of\nwinning and could only run away. Of\ncourse, no one would let him go and they\nchased after him in a swarm. Sumu\nwatched Typhoon flee in disarray, a\nsmile of interest curving his lips. He\nhad to admit that Typhoon was indeed\nvery strong, far surpassing Yong Doning\nby more than one level. The marks left\nby the fiery sun chains had already\nmostly healed as he ran. Clearly due to\nthe effectiveness of the unending\nrecovery ability. However, no matter how\nstrong you are, it's useless. Real\nbattles don't rely solely on brute\nforce. Typhoon was very fast. After all,\nhis abilities were all related to his\nphysique. But the superhumans chasing\nhim were not ordinary people either. One\nof them suddenly stopped, took a deep\nbreath, and then opened his mouth, and\nroared, \"Buzz!\" A piercing noise came\nfrom this person's mouth and the\nsurrounding air trembled eerily as a\npowerful soundwave surged toward Tyong.\nTyphong screamed in agony, clutching his\nhead and falling to the ground with\nfaint red blood flowing from his ears.\nAs he fell to the ground, several\nattacks arrived in an instant. Several\nchains of lava bound him, and the lava\nburned his skin, emitting a burnt smell.\nJun Wu Shang s sword gleamed white light\nand slashed fiercely, leaving several\ndeep sword marks on Tyang&lt;unk&gt;s body\nthat revealed bone, but that was all. It\ncould not cut through the bone at all.\nYang Doning also made a token two\nstrikes, then walked away looking\ndejected because he realized that he was\nthe weakest among them. Even though he\nhad fully mastered Iron Heart, he\ncouldn't break through Typhen's defense\nat all. It was like two iron blocks\ncolliding. In contrast, everyone else's\nmethods were capable of harming Typho.\nEven the seemingly most cowardly Tauist,\nJun Wu Shang, could wound Typho with his\nsword. No wonder Hearts of Iron is only\nsequence 9. Its ranking is not without\nreason. At this moment, the man who had\nreleased the sound waves earlier pulled\nout a silver revolver. The revolver had\na strange shape with a barrel that was\nalmost as long as a baby's arm. It was\nentirely silver and looked exceptionally\nbright under the sun. Bang! A silver\nbullet shot toward Tyang&lt;unk&gt;s head. As\nhe fell to the ground, Typhong\nimmediately felt a chilling sense of\ncrisis. He struggled with all his might,\nbut the bullet did not hit his head.\nInstead, it struck his chest. A splash\nof blood bloomed on his chest. His\nproud, steelely body had not been able\nto stop the bullet. Mithil bullets.\nTyangs expression grew increasingly\npanicked, clearly showing extreme fear\nof the gun. Typho, for everyone's sake,\nI have no choice but to ask you to die.\nThe man holding the silver gun slowly\nwalked over, raised the pistol, and\npointed it at Tyangs head. Tyangs eyes\nwere bloodshot as he struggled\ndesperately, but there were too many\nlava chains binding him, making it\nimpossible to break free in a short\ntime. Chapter 85. We've all been treated\nlike idiots by him. Just as the man with\nthe silver gun was about to pull the\ntrigger, Siaan, who had not yet made a\nmove, suddenly spoke up. Wait a minute.\nI feel something is a miss. The man with\nthe silver gun sneered. What? You're\ngetting soft-hearted just because you\ntwo work for the same company? Siaan\nsaid with a solemn expression. Don't you\nfind it strange? Su Mu is so powerful.\nIf he wanted to kill Tai Foam, he could\ndo so with a flick of his finger, but he\nhasn't made a move yet. And who is Mr.\nSu? Why would he need to personally deal\nwith someone like this? Get out of my\nway right now, or I'll kill you, too.\nHold on. I need to check Tyangs wounds\nagain. Siakuan was still trying his best\nto stop him. However, the man with the\nsilver gun had already lost his patience\nand was about to pull the trigger.\nSiaan's eyes turned cold, and countless\nbrown feathers instantly sprouted from\nhis short body. His hands transformed\ninto sharp eagle claws. Whoosh! Ah! The\nsilver spear wielding man's arm was\ninstantly severed by the eagle's claws,\nand blood gushed out. \"I'll kill you.\"\nThe silver spear wielding man, missing a\nhand, was about to unleash a sonic\nattack, but Seaan wouldn't give him the\nchance. The feathers on his body\ntransformed into monkey fur, and his\nfigure became increasingly emaciated. He\nbent down, using his hands and feet to\nexert force simultaneously. His whole\nbody like a nimble monkey, instantly\nappearing behind the man with the silver\nspear. Then, with lightning speed, he\nstretched out two hands covered in\nmonkey hair, grabbed the man's head, and\ntwisted it forcefully. Snap! The man\nwith the silver gun had his neck snapped\ninstantly and collapsed to the ground.\nTyphoon was shocked. He never expected\nthat his relationship with Xiaawuan was\nso close that the other party would risk\nhis life for him. I said, \"I want to\ncheck his wounds again.\" Siaan's face\ncovered in monkey hair was filled with\nmurderous intent. And everyone hesitated\nfor a moment. What's the point of\nchecking? Seeing is believing. He's a\nfollower of the angels. The man wielding\nthe fiery chain said wearily, \"I can\ntell you clearly want to save him.\"\nSiaan coldly said, \"If I join forces\nwith him, do you think the few of you\ncan stop me? Although I am only bronze\neye, my bronze law beast mimicry\nsequence is ranked 102nd. I don't need\nto explain what that means, do I?\" Upon\nhearing this, everyone's expression\nchanged immediately. Even the\nextraordinary Yong Yong Doning was\nfrightened. He had previously read the\ninformation given to him by Murang Mli.\nAlthough he had not memorized all of the\nbronze sequence, he understood what\nsequence 102 meant. Sequence 99 is a\nhurdle. A sequence that can reach 100 is\ncalled a high sequence, which is a\nqualitative change compared to a low\nsequence. Sometimes a single high\nsequence user can even kill a low\nsequence user at bronze 2. He recalled\nthe description of beast mimicry. He\ncouldn't remember the exact words, but\nhe remembered the general ability. It\ncould mimic the forms of 100 beasts.\nAlthough this bronze law didn't have\nstrong offensive power, it was very\ncomprehensive and could fight on land,\nsea, and air, which was enough to deal\nwith most crises. Seeing that he had\nintimidated everyone, Siaan's hand\ntransformed into an eagle claw once\nmore, his sharp nails gleaming coldly in\nthe sunlight. Swish. He suddenly waved\nhis hand, and Tyong sight vest ripped\nopen, revealing a muscular body with a\nmetallic sheen. Turn around. Typhong\ndidn't hesitate and turned around\nimmediately. He knew he couldn't\npossibly defeat the combined forces of\neveryone. If Siaan wanted to harm him,\nthere was no need for him to kill the\nsilver spear man. The charred wound was\nonce again exposed to everyone's eyes.\nSiakuan, what else do you want to argue\nabout? The evidence is irrefutable. The\nman controlling the blazing sun chains\nroared in dissatisfaction. However,\nSiaan did not respond. Instead, he\nturned his nose into a dog's nose,\nsniffed hard, and then a cold smile\nflashed across his face. He bent down\nand grabbed the burned area with his\nhand, tearing off a piece of rotten\nflesh. Everyone was immediately shocked.\n\"What? What happened? Wasn't he burned?\nWhy is there rotting flesh and blood?\"\nSiakuan gave a cold laugh and looked at\nSumu, who was leaning against a stone\npillar in the distance. Sumu seemed to\nsense the gaze, smiled slightly at him,\nand nodded in acknowledgement. We've all\nbeen fooled. That guy's surname Sue is\nthe real believer in the angels.\nSiakwan's murderous intent intensified.\nHe couldn't bear being made a fool of\nlike a clown. Don't talk nonsense. If\nMr. Su is a believer in angels, how do\nyou explain the decay on his body? Don't\nforget that it was he who suggested that\nthere were believers and angels among us\nand took the initiative to check\neveryone. Jun Wuang didn't believe\nXiau&lt;unk&gt;s words at all and retorted.\nThe man also looked incredulous, but\nYong Dongqing, who knew Sumu best, felt\na sudden unease. Oh no, this is\nsomething he's capable of doing. If I'm\nnot mistaken, Sumu's ability should be\nrelated to illusion. He used illusion to\nchange the wound and pointed the finger\nat the strongest Typho. Wanting to use\neveryone's strength to kill Typhong\nfirst. Do you believe it or not? As long\nas Typhong dies, there will definitely\nbe another angel believer among us who\nwill switch sides. Unfortunately, he\nunderestimated my nose. Although the\nappearance of the wound has changed, the\nsmell of burning and rotting is\ncompletely different. Siaan explained\ncoldly. Jun Wuang still didn't believe\nit. Are you kidding me? With brother Su\nstrength, would he need to resort to\nsuch petty tricks? If he were an angel\nbeliever, we would all be dead by now.\nWhy would he be putting on an act with\nyou? At this moment, Typhong also came\nto his senses, and his face turned\nextremely ugly. Perhaps he doesn't have\nsuch great strength at all and his\nprevious attacks were just illusions.\nNot bad, Siaan smiled coldly. I was\nwondering before why an attack that\ncould change the celestial phenomena was\nsilent. Because of the beast mimicry, my\nfive senses are beyond those of ordinary\npeople. I can have the eyes of an eagle,\nthe nose of a dog, and the ears of a cat\nat the same time. So even though the\ndistance was far away, I could still\ndetect the abnormality. After the dark\nclouds appeared, the air humidity did\nnot change, and there was no air flow\nthat the falling giant sword should have\ngenerated. It can be said that apart\nfrom what the naked eye could see,\nnothing else should have been there,\nwhich completely defied common sense.\nThis can only mean one thing. Sumu\npossesses an illusionary ability that\nmanipulates vision. He's treating us all\nlike idiots. The chains of lava snapped\nin an instant, and Typhoon dragged his\ninjured body to his feet with\ndifficulty. His eyes were filled with\nunimaginable rage. The feeling of being\nfooled was worse than being killed.\nEspecially when he thought about his\nprevious fawning and ingratiating\nappearance. He was so angry that his\nheart felt like it was going to explode.\nI should have realized this sooner. If\nhe is really that powerful, why would he\nbe forced to the sacrificial sight by\nthe unmemorable ones just like us?\nChapter 86. If you all see through my\nillusion, I actually know a little bit\nof martial arts. Click, click, click.\nThe sound of steel being squeezed and\nrubbed against each other kept coming\nfrom Tyang&lt;unk&gt;s mouth. He was almost\ngrinding his teeth to powder. The\nsituation completely reversed at this\nmoment with the spear head pointing\ndirectly at Su Mu. Yong Donging realized\nsomething was wrong. He was naturally on\nSumu's side. But now the two of them\nwere forcibly divided into the camps of\nangel and demon which made them mortal\nenemies. This made him hesitate. Kill\nhim. Typhoon roared, his face ashen, and\ncharged toward the center of the\nsacrificial sight like a human tank.\nSiaan transformed into a werewolf,\nstanding on all fours and followed\nclosely behind. The chain man did the\nsame, and all three of them had a\nfurious killing intent flashing on their\nfaces. Only Yong Donging and Jun Wuang\nshowed hesitation. \"Brother Yong, what\ndo we do? After all, Brother Su works\nfor us, too.\" Su run. Yong Donging\nsuddenly shouted and rushed towards the\ncrowd to stop him. Jun Wu Shan was taken\naback. He hadn't expected Yong Doning to\nchoose to stand on Su Mu&lt;unk&gt;s side.\nAfter all, only one side could survive,\nthe angel or the demon. Boy, how dare\nyou betray us? Tying&lt;unk&gt;s killing\nintent surged, and he showed no mercy to\nYong Donging, who was charging towards\nhim. His right arm muscles bulged\ninstantly like an inflating balloon,\nbecoming thicker than an adult male's\nthigh. The bulging muscles had hard,\ndistinct lines and contained terrifying\npower. His eyes narrowed and he suddenly\nswung his right fist, which sliced\nthrough the air with a sharp explosive\nsound. \"Don't kill him,\" Siaan suddenly\nsaid. Trusting Xiauan, Tyangs fist\nchanged direction in midair, moving from\nYong Dong&lt;unk&gt;s head to his chest. Yong\nDong&lt;unk&gt;s arms gleamed with metallic\nlight as he tried to block the punch.\nHowever, the difference between Bronze\nEye and Bronze 3 was too great. His\nproud steel body was as fragile as paper\nin front of this punch. Click. His\ndefensive arms were instantly broken and\nthe terrifying force slammed into his\nchest cavity through the severed arms.\nYang Doning was sent flying backward,\nblood gushing from his mouth. That punch\nseverely injured him. Why can't we kill\nhim? Typhong asked, still furious.\nKilling the demon cultists will benefit\nthe angels. Sumu's strength is currently\nunknown, so we cannot allow his burns to\nheal,\" Siakuan said coldly. \"Kill Sumu\nfirst and don't cause any more trouble.\"\nThe two exchanged a glance and then\nrushed towards Sumu. Soon, the three of\nthem arrived at the center of the\nsacrificial sight, forming a triangle\nthat firmly surrounded Sumu. \"You,\nsurnamed Sue, have deceived us so\nbadly.\" Typhoam covered in wounds stared\nintently at Sumu while the bald man who\nhad been hiding in the corner was\nignored. Surrounded by three\nextraordinary individuals, Sumu showed\nno panic whatsoever. Instead, he smiled\nslightly and said, \"How can you call it\na lie about extraordinary individuals?\nYou're just too stupid. You can't blame\nanyone else.\" The three were instantly\nenraged. They hadn't expected Su Mu to\nbe so arrogant, even after being\nexposed. But it was precisely because of\nthis that they dared not act rashly, as\nnone of them knew Sumu's true strength.\nIf what he said about being bronze 3 was\ntrue, then it means that besides visual\nillusions, he also has two other hidden\nabilities. Sumu, you don't need to\nbluff. If we don't kill you, we'll all\nbe dead for sure, so you can't scare us.\nSiaan's small eyes flashed with a cold\nlight, and his hands had somehow\ntransformed into a pair of tiger claws.\nFaced with the threat, Sum Mu&lt;unk&gt;s\nsmile widened. This is more interesting.\nActually, I was really worried that you\nwere all idiots who would keep killing\neach other until they died without\nrealizing it. I didn't expect that you\nwould find out after only one person\ndied. Come on, let's all come at you.\nThe group exchanged glances. Although\nthey were somewhat wary in the face of\nlife and death, none of them cared about\nmartial ethics, and they immediately\ncharged forward side by side. Let's do\nit. Typhong took the lead. His legs\nsuddenly exerting force. The ground\ninstantly cracked and he soared into the\nair, crashing towards Sumu like a\ncannonball. At the same time, a lava\nchain arrived in an instant. Faced with\nthe two men's combined attack, Sumu did\nnot take any action. However, when their\nattacks came one after another, his\nfigure disappeared inch by inch like a\ndream bubble. Illusion, Typhong\nexclaimed in shock, realizing the\nstrangeness of Su Mu&lt;unk&gt;s methods. At\nthis moment, Siaan, who had not yet made\na move, sneered, and his tiger claws\ntore through the air as he attacked the\narea behind the stone pillar. A figure\nin black leaped lightly and dodged the\ntiger's claws. \"Sumu, your illusions may\nfool them, but they can't fool me.\"\nSiaan's eyes gleamed with smuggness.\n\"The sound of your footsteps when you\nmove has already given you away. You two\nlisten to my instructions. Don't believe\nyour eyes. I'll show you where he is.\"\nsurrounded again, Sumu remained calm. He\nadjusted his brown tinted glasses and\nsaid indifferently, \"You three don't\nthink I'm only good at illusions, do\nyou?\" A look of caution flashed across\nthe three faces, but none of them were\nintimidated by Sumu. They continued to\npress closer to him, constantly\ntightening their encirclement. Sumu\nsmiled faintly. \"If you all see through\nmy illusion, I actually know a little\nbit about martial arts.\" Then, as\nbefore, he stretched out a finger and\nslowly pointed it to the sky. In an\ninstant, the weather changed\ndramatically. Huge dark clouds formed\nout of thin air and enveloped the entire\nsacrificial sight. The sky darkened.\nSeeing him resort to the same trick\nagain, Siakuan became even more smug.\nHe, you've run out of tricks. The air\nhumidity hasn't changed, and the airflow\nhasn't moved. Don't embarrass yourself\nwith such a false illusion. Illusion.\nSumu's lips curled into a slight smile,\na hint of mockery flashing across his\nface. still unaware of your impending\ndoom. Shadow summoning. Demonic descent.\nShadow summoning. Everyone was slightly\nsurprised. Was this another bronze law\nof Sumu? How come they had never heard\nof it before? Could it be some kind of\nhidden law? Saan, watch out behind you.\nTyong suddenly shouted anxiously.\nSiakuan quickly turned his head and saw\nthat a humanoid monster more than 2 m\ntall whose body was made of shadows had\nemerged from the darkness behind him.\nIts body was thin and looked like a\ndried corpse. Its hands were long and\nhung down to the ground. The part of its\nface opened up a pair of scarlet blood\neyes. Xiauan was startled, but then he\nsneered. No footsteps, no smell, just a\nmere illusion. However, what he didn't\nknow was that shadows don't make\nfootsteps or have any smell. Then,\ncompletely ignoring the shadowy figure\nbehind him, he looked at Su Mu with a\nmocking smile. It seems you really have\nno other tricks up your sleeve. Then,\nprepare to die. Just as he was about to\nmake his move, everything suddenly went\nblack. It turned out that the humanoid\nshadow had stretched out its withered\narm, its five fingers extended like\nbranches, and its body was bent like a\ngentleman extending an invitation to\ndance. Humphan completely ignored it and\nwas about to walk straight through the\nshadowy figure. When bang, Siaan stood\nfrozen in place, staring at the dark\nfigure's arm blocking his way, a pain\nshooting through his forehead as if he\nhad hit a tree. Instantly, his\nexpression changed drastically, an\noverwhelming fear gripping his very\nsoul. This is not an illusion. Chapter\n87. Good and evil. Before he could\nfinish speaking, the impatient figure\ngrabbed Xiauan's hand and forcibly\ndragged him into the darkness. No, Tyo,\nsave me. Siaan screamed shrilly, his\nterrified cry sending chills down the\nspines of Typho and his companion. The\nnext second, the sound stopped abruptly.\nThe dark figure disappeared and Siaan\nalso disappeared. It all seemed like an\nillusion. Huh? A soft laugh broke the\ndeathly silence in the room. Typhoon and\nthe other man stared in horror at Su\nMu&lt;unk&gt;s smiling face, which looked like\nthe smile of a devil. Sumu elegantly\npushed up his brown tinted glasses. Let\nme make this clear in advance. I do not\naccept surrender. Shadow summoning\nthump. The luxurious snakes skin came\nlightly touched the ground and darkness\nsurged from its tip like a tide,\nspreading rapidly and transforming into\ncountless tiny mysterious runes that\nspread across the land centered on Sumu,\nforming a strange and mysterious magic\ncircle. Then a scene that terrified Tyo\nand his companion unfolded. From within\nthe massive magic array, humanoid\nshadows, each over 2 m tall, emerged. 1\n2 10 100 A full hundred shadowy monsters\nemerged from the magic circle\nsurrounding Sum Mu like stars around the\nmoon. At this moment, Sumu Mu was like a\nshadow emperor. He waved his hand\nlightly and the shadow monsters\ninstantly swarmed out. Rot Tyang&lt;unk&gt;s\neyes widened in horror and he turned and\nran in terror. He never expected that\nSumu would have such a hidden skill.\nThis time, he didn't think it was an\nillusion because Siaan's screams were\nstill vivid in his mind. Sumu ignored\nthe two who were running away and\ninstead chuckled. Sigh. I lied again by\naccident today. What if this becomes a\nhabit? The shadow legion was obviously\nan illusion. Only the shadow that killed\nSiaan was real, his good friend whom he\nbrought from the nightmare world, and\nnot innocent. There are two limitations\nto using the not white skill. First, it\nmust be dark. Second, you can only kill\none person at a time. So when he pointed\nto the sky with one finger, causing dark\nclouds to cover the sky, his purpose was\nto prepare for Boo Ba's appearance. Now\nall he had to do was wait for Bouai to\nfinish digesting Xiauan before killing\nTai Foam and the other two one by one. A\nclever illusion, like a clever lie, must\nbe a mixture of truth and falsehood,\nreality and illusion. At this moment,\nYong Dongqing and Jun Wu Shang ran over,\nlooking at Su Mu with complicated\nexpressions, hesitant to speak. Sumu,\nare you really a believer in angels? In\nthe end, Yong Doning couldn't hold back\nany longer and asked the question that\nhad been on his mind. Sumu nodded. Of\ncourse, I have always emphasized that I\nam a good person. Now that we have the\nstatue as a witness, no one can slander\nme in the future. What time is it?\nYou're still in the mood for jokes. Yong\nDonging said anxiously. You're an angel.\nWe're&lt;unk&gt; demons. Only one of us can\nsurvive. Sumu patted Yong Donging on the\nshoulder. Don't worry, I will take good\ncare of Jasmine for you. Go in peace,\nyou son of a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Yong Donging\ninstantly became furious. If his arms\nhadn't been broken, he would have\npunched Su Mu right away. Haha, just\nkidding. Actually, I already had a way\nto break the curse. Brother Su, do you\nreally have a way? Jun Wuang was\noverjoyed. He really didn't want to have\nto kill his colleagues to survive. There\nis a way, but it requires the\ncooperation of the two of you. Oh,\nright. I almost forgot there's one more\nperson. With that, Sumu pulled over Xiao\nYong Xiang, the nightmare apostle who\nhad been hiding in the corner, trembling\nwith fear. In fact, the idols are not\ndivided into camps based on good and\nevil. What is the basis for that? Jun\nWuang asked hurriedly. Although Yong\nDongqing, who was still angry, had\nalready perked up his ears, Sumu didn't\nkeep them in suspense and explained.\nBased on your inner guilt, or rather\nyour clear thinking, as long as you\nbelieve you are right, then you are in\nthe angel camp. Take Yong Doning for\nexample. This guy killed a lot of\npeople, but he believed that the worst\nthing he did was rob 50,000 yuan. In\nother words, in his heart, he felt that\nthese people deserve to die. But robbing\nmoney was wrong. That woman from before\nwiped out her entire enemy family. From\nher tone, you could tell she believed in\nthe principle of a life for a life and\nthat she had done nothing wrong.\nTherefore, she was on the angelic side.\nJun Wuang suddenly realized, \"I\nunderstand. Even if I do evil, as long\nas I don't think I'm doing evil, then\nI'm in the angel camp. Yes, who can\ndistinguish right from wrong? From the\nperspective of ants, all humans are\nevil. But from the perspective of God,\nno matter how evil the things humans do,\nthey will only think that it is a group\nof ants fighting. Therefore, God doesn't\ncare whether people are good or not. The\nonly thing he truly cares about is\nyourself. Brother Sue, how can we break\nthe curse? Of course, we should kill\neveryone in the opposing camp. Jun Wuang\ns expression changed slightly. Brother\nSu, please stop joking. Sumu shook his\nhead. I'm not joking. There is only one\nway to break the curse because it is a\nrule set by the gods and demons. Unless\nyou have enough strength to defeat the\ngods and demons. You can only follow the\nrules of the game they set. Don't worry,\nsince it's a game, there will naturally\nbe loopholes. We don't need to fight\neach other. We just need to switch\nsides. How do I change? Jun Wuang looked\ntroubled. To be honest, I didn't pay for\nthe foot massage last time, but that\ndidn't make me feel guilty. I paid back\nnumber eight a long time ago after I\nearned the money. What I really feel\nguilty about is that I have failed my\nmaster's teachings. My master told me to\nstay away from worldly desires and women\nand to focus on the Dao. But I have gone\nagainst the Dao. That's simple. Just\nrelax and accept my hypnosis, Sumu said\ncalmly. Jun Wu Jang s expression changed\ndrastically. Hypnosis? You're not going\nto do anything strange to me, are you?\nSumu, I've noticed that you've disobeyed\nyour master's orders more than once,\nhaven't you? You don't read Tawa's\nscriptures on a regular basis, but\nyou've watched a lot of pornographic\nvideos, haven't you? Upon hearing this,\nJun Wuang s ears turned red and his eyes\nflickered as he said, \"I was just\nlooking around.\" All right, if you\nbelieve me, then relax and don't resist.\nIf you don't believe me, then join Tyo\nand the others. It's your choice. Jun Wu\nJang s expression changed several times\nbefore he finally nodded with\ndifficulty. We are all people from the\nbronze coffin. I believe Miss Murong\nwould not hire bad people into the\ncompany. I believe you. Sumu frowned\nslightly. He didn't understand why all\nhis colleagues were love struck. No,\nYong Doning could be considered lover\nstruck, but Jun Wuang could only be\nconsidered a s at the moment. Chapter\n88. I understand now. Foot massage is\nalso away. Look at this pocket watch. A\ndark gold pocket watch with an\nUrao&lt;unk&gt;'s pattern came into Jun Wu\nXang s view. A moment later, Jun Wuang\nexcitedly opened his eyes and looked at\nSu Mu with great excitement. Brother Su,\nI understand. Foot massage is also away.\nThe tow is everywhere from the vast\nheavens and the earth to a single flower\nand tree all contain its essence. It can\nbe the first ray of sunlight in the\nmorning, or the bed made for me on the\n6th, or the bowl of clear soup served to\nme on the eighth. Yong Donaing, standing\nto the side, stared in disbelief. \"So,\nyou actually found two more?\" Jun Wuang\nbecame more and more excited as he\nspoke, as if he had touched upon the Dao\nthat he had been searching for all\nalong. Brother Yang, you're too attached\nto appearances. Finding a few isn't the\npoint. The point is, how can one\ntranscend the world without engaging\nwith it? How can one comprehend the\nwonders of the great Dao without\nexperiencing the troubles of the mortal\nrealm? A person stripped of their skin\nis nothing more than 206 bones. Dressed,\nthey possess 18,000 forms. Seeing a\nbeautiful woman as white bones makes me\nwithout desire. Seeing white bones as\nbeautiful women makes me without fear.\nWithout desire and without fear, the\ngreat Dao is within reach. Looking at\nJun Wu Shang, who was talking loudly and\neloquently, Yong Doning held back for a\nlong time before finally uttering a\nsingle word. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] So that's your excuse\nfor not paying for your foot massage.\nAll right, Jun Wu Shang, go to the\nstatue and answer the questions again\nand switch sides. Sumu really didn't\nwant to listen to these two's rambling\nand urged them directly. All right,\nbrother Su. Having seen the great Dao,\nJun Wuang walked briskly to the statue\nand answered its question again. Sure\nenough, this time he believed that even\nfoot massage was a form of healing, but\nthe decay on his body was completely\ngone, leaving only burns. Yong Doning,\nit's your turn. Sumu glanced at Yong\nDoning. Yong Donging took a deep breath,\nhis eyes full of distrust, and said,\n\"Don't take this opportunity to instill\nany strange ideas in me.\" Sumu was too\nlazy to pay attention to him. This kind\nof hotad was someone who could be\ncontrolled without hypnosis. Unless\nnecessary, he was unwilling to waste his\nmental energy on Yong Doning. He would\nrather feed Bubai. After a moment, Yong\nDonging&lt;unk&gt;s eyes cleared. Now I\nunderstand. Robin Hood is a righteous\nact and no one has stipulated that you\ncan't rob others of their wealth to help\nyour own poverty. Then he went to the\nstatue and switched sides again.\nFinally, there was Xiao Yong Xiang who\nhad been largely ignored. Considering\nthat Xiao Yong Xiang was also part of\nthe bronze coffin and thus one of his\nsubordinates, Sumu hypnotized him and\nswitched his allegiance. At this point,\nthere were four angel believers and only\ntwo demon believers left. Due to the\nchange in numbers, Su Mu and the others\nfound that their burns were beginning to\nlessen while the decay on Typho and the\nother two was worsening. Brother Su,\nsince we can switch sides in this way,\nwhy don't we just hypnotize them too\ninstead of fighting each other with\nTypho and the others? Jun Wuang\nsuggested. Sumu shook his head. Do you\nthink Typho and the others will agree\nthem? Jun Wuang was taken aback and his\nwords trailed off. Yes. How could\nTyphoon and the others agree to\nhypnosis? It was tantamount to handing\ntheir lives over to someone else. If\nSumu had malicious intentions and took\nthe opportunity to smuggle something\ninto the hypnosis, the two of them might\nbecome slaves forever. How about I try\nto persuade them? Jun Wuang thought for\na moment and said, \"Their refusal to\naccept hypnosis is simply because they\nare worried about being manipulated. But\nI have already accepted hypnosis, and\nI'm fine, aren't I? Perhaps some gentle\npersuasion will work.\" Sumu smiled\nslightly. You want to persuade them? Do\nyou think they'll think you've been\nmanipulated by me and are deliberately\ndeceiving them? This Jun Wuang was at a\nloss for words. Also, who told you I\nwould never manipulate them under\nhypnosis? Why would I refuse two\npowerful thugs? Brother Su, don't joke\naround. You're a good person. If you\nreally wanted to do this, I would\ndefinitely be the first one you\nbrainwashed. Oh, how can you be sure you\nhaven't been brainwashed by me? Sumu's\nlips curled into a mysterious smile. Jun\nWuan chuckled. Brother Su, what are you\nsaying? Do you think I don't know\nwhether I've been brainwashed or not?\nSumu smiled without saying a word, but\nYong Donging felt a strange unease. This\nJun Wuang is acting strangely. He's\nalready told you the truth, and you\nstill think Sumu is a good person? Damn,\nhas he been brainwashed? Thinking of\nthis, Yong Donging panicked a little. He\neven wondered if Sumu had taken the\nopportunity to brainwash him, but then\nhe thought that probably not. After all,\nhe had already agreed to work for him\nfor 3 years, so there was no need for\nhim to brainwash him. With that thought,\nhe felt relieved. Ah, my hand. Typhoam,\nwho was running for his life, suddenly\nscreamed. He raised his arm and found\nthat the rot that had previously\nrecovered had reappeared and was\nspreading rapidly. The man with the\nblazing sun chains was in the same\nstate, his face filled with panic.\nWhat's going on? Why is the decay\nspeeding up? Could it be that Jun Wu\nShang and the others were killed by Su\nMu, causing the angels to become\nstronger? Suddenly, Typhong looked at\nthe Black Shadow Legion that was\nconstantly pursuing him, and a fierce\nlook flashed in his eyes. He was like a\nbadly wounded beast preparing to fight\nto the death. We can't let this go on\nany longer. If we drag this out any\nlonger, even if we aren't killed by the\nShadow Legion, we'll die from the\ndemon's curse. Let's fight them to the\ndeath. With a roar, Typhoon abruptly\nturned around and charged towards the\nshadowy legion. Seeing this, the man\nwith the blazing sun chains also showed\na look of madness. Damn it, let's fight.\nThe two launched a desperate charge\nagainst the hundreds of shadowy figures.\nHowever, the moment the two clashed,\nthey were stunned because their attacks\npassed right through the shadow legion\nas if they had hit nothing at all. This\nthe two exchanged an incredulous glance,\nboth seeing shock and anger in each\nother's eyes. Damn it. This is an\nillusion, too. We've been completely\nfooled. Typhoon roared angrily, feeling\nlike his intelligence had been\nthoroughly rubbed into the ground by\nSumu. Being fooled wasn't scary. What\nwas scary was being fooled by the same\ntrick twice in a row. That's not right.\nIf it was an illusion, then how did Sia\ndie? Tying&lt;unk&gt;s eyes flashed with a\nmurderous glint. You're asking me? Who\nam I supposed to ask? I don't care how\nSiaan died. I only know that if we don't\nkill Sumu, we&lt;unk&gt;ll both die. Come on,\nlet's go back and kill our way back.\nBefore long, Typhoon and his companion\nreturned to fight their way back. When\nthey found Sumu, they discovered that he\nwas standing in a pile of corpses, his\nfair hands covered in blood, and at his\nfeet lay the gruesome bodies of Jun Wu\nShang, Yong Donging, and others.\nTying&lt;unk&gt;s pupils contracted just as he\nexpected. Sumu had indeed killed Jun Wu\nShang and the others, which was why the\ncurse on the two of them was becoming\nstronger. Chapter 89. the myriad\nphenomena of the universe. Black vision.\nSumu, you really are ruthless. I never\nthought that with only you left in the\nangel faction, you would turn the tide\nand wipe out our demon faction to this\nextent. Tyoam, whose face was half\nrotten, looked at Su Mu, whose hands\nwere covered in blood and who was\nsmiling and felt a chill rise in his\nheart. This was definitely the most\ndangerous opponent he had ever\nencountered in the first half of his\nlife. The danger did not refer to how\nstrong the opponent was, but rather to\nthe opponent's cunning and unpredictable\nmethods. He single-handedly nearly wiped\nout the demon cultists who had the upper\nhand. Stop wasting time talking to him.\nAttack! A crimson chain made of lava\nrushed towards Sumu. The next moment,\nSumu's figure shattered like a bubble.\nDamn it, it's an illusion again. Without\nSiaan, it will be very difficult for us\nto break his illusions. Don't panic.\nEven if our hearing isn't as good as\nSia's, it's still far superior to that\nof ordinary people. Concentrate and\nlisten carefully, and we'll definitely\nbe able to hear his footsteps, Typhong\nsaid urgently. So, the two of them\nimmediately held their breath and\nstrained their ears, trying to hear the\nslightest sound. And they actually heard\nit. Breathing sounds. There are\nbreathing sounds all around. Wait,\nsomething's not right. Why are there\nfour people breathing? Huh? The man\ncontrolling the chains suddenly let out\na scream. Typhoon was shocked and looked\nover and was immediately horrified. Half\nof a gleaming sword blade was visible\nthrough the man's chest. And standing\nbehind him was none other than Jun Wu\nShang who had already died. Not only Jun\nWuang, but also Yong Donging and that\nordinary person came back to life. Yu\nyou guys. Typhoon was both shocked and\nfurious at this moment. How could he not\nsee that these people had faked their\ndeaths in order to cooperate with Sumu?\nThe only thing he couldn't understand\nwas that these people were clearly from\nthe demon camp. Weren't they just\ncourting death? Before anyone knew it,\nSumu, who was spotless, slowly emerged\nfrom behind a stone wall, gently tapping\nthe ground with his snakeskin cane, his\nsteps light and elegant. Typhoon, I can\ngive you a chance to live, to submit, or\nto die. Sumu said calmly, \"You don't\nneed to worry about the curse. If you\nchoose to submit, I will help you\ntransform into the angel faction.\" After\nhe finished speaking, he gestured to\nYong Donging and the others with his\neyes, and they all showed off their\nburns. He didn't intend to subdue both\nof them. Humans are creatures that won't\nbehave unless they're pushed to the\nbrink. They have all sorts of thoughts\nin their minds, and compared to the\nblazing sun chains, Iron Peak of Bronze\n3 is clearly more valuable to subdue.\nTai Fangs face was ashen, his eyes\nflickering. What is the method to switch\nsides? Hypnosis. As long as you accept\nmy hypnosis, I can help you switch\nsides. Hypnosis? Upon hearing these two\nwords, Tyangs heart sank to the bottom.\nYou've pushed me to this point, and now\nyou want me to submit. Sumu shrugged\nindifferently. Anyway, you're used to\nbeing a dog for nobles. After all, what\ndifference does it make who you're a dog\nfor? I'll [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] kill you. Typhoon went\ncompletely berserk, charging towards\nSumu like a human tank, leaving behind a\ndense spiderweb of cracks on the ground\nwith every step he took. Tsk tisk. Sumu\nshook his head helplessly. Why would a\nperfectly healthy person choose to seek\ndeath? The next moment, he took off his\nbrown glasses, and his deep eyes\nsuddenly burst forth with a bright blue\nlight, turning his entire eyes a crystal\nblue. All things in the universe, black\nvision. Whoosh! Typhen&lt;unk&gt;s vision went\nblack as if an invisible black cloth had\ncovered his eyes and he had become\ncompletely blind. This is one of the\nuses of Sinuancho since it is an\nillusion that manipulates vision. It can\nalso deprive people of their vision. H\nI'll kill you. Unable to see, Typhon was\nlike a mad beast, wildly swinging his\nfists. Wherever he went, walls and stone\npillars were smashed to pieces, but he\ncouldn't hit Sumu. Sumu's true form had\nalready hidden far away, watching Tai\nphone go berserk. He did not use the\nblack shadow not white because not white\nhad not yet finished digesting Siaan. It\nwas probably the first time he had\ndevoured a superhuman and the digestion\nprocess was exceptionally slow. Of\ncourse, he wasn't worried that Siauaning\nwould come out alive. Bubai&lt;unk&gt;s\nabilities were strange. Unless he knew\nthe way to break the dark illusion in\nadvance, who would keep their eyes\nclosed and let Bouai lead them around?\nSumu, what should we do next? Yong\nDonging stared intently at the crazed\nTypho. Somewhat worried, he knew Su\nMu&lt;unk&gt;s true nature. A complete sickly\nperson who relied entirely on hypnosis\nand illusion. Although Tyo was now\nblinded, he couldn't kill him with\nillusion alone, which had no offensive\ncapabilities. He wanted to help, but his\nhands had been broken by Tyo, leaving\nhim with virtually no fighting ability.\nGoing up there would only be suicide.\nJun Wuan gripped his long sword tightly,\nseemingly about to step forward, but was\nstopped by Sumu. Watch closely. He\nsmiled faintly, then pulled a silver\nrevolver from his waist. The barrel was\nthick and long, like a baby's arm. Yang\nDonging was taken aback. Isn't this the\ngun that Sonic Kid used before? Typhong\neven mentioned Myithil bullets back\nthen. When did you get them? Sumu did\nnot answer, but took out a white\nhandkerchief and carefully wiped the\nsilver white pistol. He did not like to\nuse things that others had used, so he\nneeded to wipe off the sweat and\nfingerprints first. Soon, after wiping\nit clean, he gently raised the silver\nwhite pistol and aimed it at the crazed\nTaiong in the arena. Bang! A loud\ngunshot rang out, and a burst of blood\nerupted from Tyang's heart. He fell\nheavily to the ground, his eyes blinded,\nand screamed in agony. His survival\ninstinct made him clutch his head to\nprotect his vital organs, and he\nstruggled to his feet. Bang! Another\nshot hit his right chest, this time\nseemingly breaking his spine, causing\nhim to fall to the ground again, his\nhands hanging limply at his sides. Bang!\nThe final shot hit the head, instantly\ncreating a bloody hole. All movement\nceased abruptly, and there was no sound.\nTyphoon is dead. At this point, the\ndemon faction was completely wiped out.\nLooking at the tragically dead Typho,\nJun Wuang showed a look of pity and\nshook his head repeatedly. Two bullets\nto the body and one to the head. Even a\ngod would be worried. The battle was\nthat simple. Sumu only used a negligible\namount of mental energy, plus three\nbullets, to directly or indirectly kill\nseveral superhumans, including one of\nthem, a bronze 3. With Tyangs death, the\nburns on their bodies completely\ndisappeared. Call. Sumu blew on the\nstill smoking muzzle of the gun, a\nsatisfied smile playing on his lips. Not\na noble fantasm, yet possessing power\ncomparable to one. Is this the Myithil\nbullet? From now on, you're mine. I'll\ncall you silver rose. He twirled the gun\nand then tucked the silver rose into his\nwaistband. What are mythil bullets? Yong\nDona looked at the silver rose with\nenvy. This gun could actually ignore\nTyangs steel body, which was truly\nextraordinary. Sumu glanced at him. It's\nwritten in the extraordinary information\nabout the bronze coffin. Go back and\nlook it up yourself. Chapter 90. Primal\nAngels. A bad student is a bad student.\nThey lose patience to read anything with\neven a little bit of text. \"You, Yong,\nDoning was furious. He knew that Su Mu\nhad looked down on him again, but he\ncould only be angry.\" \"Tauist, what are\nmithril bullets?\" he asked Jun Wuang in\na low voice. Jun Wuang patiently\nexplained to him. \"Mithril is the\nhardest metal in the world, and it has a\ncertain restraining effect on\nsuperhumans. Ordinary bullets cannot\nbreak through iron heart, but myithil\nbullets can. I have heard that some\npowerful superhumans also use mithril to\nforge weapons. Upon hearing this, Yong\nDong&lt;unk&gt;s heart burned with excitement.\nHe couldn't believe such a wonderful\nthing existed in the world. If he had a\nMyithil knife today, would he have had\nhis arms broken by typhoam? However, Jun\nWuang s next words poured cold water on\nhis enthusiasm. I really want a Myithil\nlong sword, but Myithil is too\nexpensive. It costs at least 10,000 yuan\nper gram. The bullets that Brother Sue\njust fired probably weigh about 10 g\neach, which is 100,000 yuan. 100,000\nyuan per shot. Three shots in total,\n300,000 yuan. This is even though Typho\ncan't see. If he could see, it would be\nvery difficult for bullets to hit him,\nand the million-doll investment would\nprobably be wasted. This is something\nnobles play with. Ordinary extraordinary\nindividuals can't afford to even touch\nit. Yong Donging&lt;unk&gt;s burning passion\ninstantly turned to ice. Impoverished as\nhe was, he couldn't believe that any\nmetal in the world could be so\nexpensive. 10,000 yuan per gram. Pry out\nthe myithil bullet from the body. But\nunfortunately, both his hands were\nbroken, so he had to call Jun Wuang for\nhelp. The two spend a lot of effort to\npry out three broken myth bullets. I'll\ntake two. You take one, Jun Wuang said,\nquickly distributing them. Yang Doning\nobjected. Why should you get two?\nBecause I dug these bullets out with my\nsword. Yong Donging was about to argue\nwhen he suddenly remembered that Typhong\nhad been shot by the sonic kid. So, he\nquickly told Jun Wuang to dig. In the\nend, they each had two Myithil bullets\nand were laughing very happily. 400,000\nin hand. It definitely won't reach\n400,000. After all, these are used\nMyithil bullets, so there's bound to be\nsome wear and tear. Plus, the buyback\nprice isn't as high as the selling\nprice. I estimate I'll be lucky to get\n200,000. 100,000 per person is worth it.\nAt least I can buy Jasmine a dress. I\nmisunderstood her last time. So, I have\nto buy her a dress to make amends.\nJasmine is your girlfriend. That's\nimpressive. Brother Yang, you don't even\nhave any hair, yet you have a\ngirlfriend. Unlike me, I can only use\nthis 100,000 yuan to learn foot massage.\nI'm not bald. My hair is from being\nburned twice before, and it hasn't grown\nback yet. While the two were digging for\nmithil bullets, Sumu came to the statue\nand carefully examined the angel statue\nin front of him. Because he was a\nbeliever in angels, all he could see\nwere angels. At this moment, the angel\nstatue was radiating a holy white light,\nits face gentle and full of\ncompassionate divinity. However, Sumu\nknew that all of this was an illusion.\nGod never pitted mortals. They were\nmerely victims of the struggle between\nangels and demons. Now that all the\ndemons are dead, the angel and the\nstatue should be able to suppress the\ndemons. He guessed there would be\nfurther developments. Just as he had\npredicted, the holy light on the angel\nstatue grew softer and brighter, and it\nseemed to come alive, its divine eyes\ngazing at Sumu. The next moment, the\nangel really came to life. The statue\nstretched out its limbs, and its eight\nsacred wings trembled behind it as if it\nhad stepped directly down from the\naltar. Sumu narrowed his eyes. He didn't\nknow what the angel was going to do. Out\nof caution, he left an illusionary clone\nin place while his real body quietly\nretreated behind the clone. However, the\npreviously invincible, all things in the\nuniverse seemed to fail at this moment.\nThe angel completely ignored the clone\nand walked straight towards the main\nbody, opening its arms as if to embrace\nit. Click. The silver rose bullet was\nchambered and aimed at the angel's head.\nIf you want to express your gratitude,\njust give me some extraordinary potions.\nNo need for a hug. Devout believers,\nreturn to God's embrace. A grand and\nethereal Sanskrit chant emanated from\nthe angel's mouth, making one want to\nobey God's command. Bang! Without the\nslightest hesitation, Sumu fired\ndirectly at the angel's head. However,\nthe myithal bullets that could pierce\nthrough Iron Heart could not harm the\nangel in the slightest, not even leaving\na mark. Yong Dongqing and his companion,\nwho were cleaning mythal bullets not far\naway, were startled by the gunshot. Why\nwere they shooting again? Another\n50,000. The two looked in the direction\nof the sound and were instantly\nhorrified to see the angel statue\nclosing in on Sumu. The two, bewildered,\nwere about to run over when they saw the\nangel transform into a beam of holy\nlight and directly enter Sumu's body.\ndarkness. A darkness as if one were in\nthe starry universe. Sumu felt as if he\nhad fallen into cold, dark seaater, his\nbody sinking and sinking, seemingly\nwithout end. An invisible giant net as\nbrilliant as the starry sky appeared\nabove the endless dimensions that was\nthe bronze law. Each node of the bronze\nlaw is inlaid with a dazzling star\nemitting starlight. Suddenly, the law\nrotates and a star that looks like the\nsun appears in Sumu's vision. It was\ncompletely different from other stars,\ndozens of times larger in size, and\nradiated holy light. The warm holy light\ndispelled the surrounding darkness, and\nSumu was able to see the scene around\nhim clearly. A sea of blood, an endless\nsea of blood. He was in the sea of\nblood, surrounded by countless\nunconscious people, still in a falling\nposition. Soon, holy light fell upon\nhim, and a sudden realization arose in\nhis mind. the Bronze Law, the primordial\nangels. Bang! The surrounding\nenvironment shattered instantly. When\nSumu regained his sight, he saw a dark\nand dilapitated house with a rocking\nchair inside and a dimly lit sky\noutside. The little girl, Tinking, was\nstanding quietly in front of him,\ntilting her head and looking at him with\ncuriosity. Big brother, were you\nnarrowed his eyes, carefully examining\nTinking before him. What was going on?\nHad time reversed? Why had he returned\nto the nightmare world? Countless\nquestions flooded his mind. He felt no\nfear of the unknown, only a longing for\nsurprises. Unexpected surprises kept\nstimulating his senses. For him, it felt\nlike his girlfriend had given him a\nmysterious gift on a day that wasn't a\nbirthday or holiday, and he was waiting\nto open it. He tried to recall the scene\ncarefully, his memory stopping at the\nangel statue, transforming into holy\nlight, crashing into him, and then he\nfainted. When he woke up, he was back in\nthe nightmare world. Illusion. Chapter\n91. Outside. You call me immortal and I\nwon't argue with you. That was his first\nreaction. Just as he continued to\nponder, Yong Dongqing&lt;unk&gt;s voice rang\nout from outside the door. Damn it. It\ngets light so fast. This room is too\nsmall. If we stay here any longer, we'll\nonly attract more shadowy figures.\nListen to me. Let's find another room.\nYanu&lt;unk&gt;s voice followed. Sumu was\nslightly dazed. He looked down at his\nshadow at his feet, but there was no\ndark figure in it. He then tried to\nsense the immaculate heart and all\nthings in the universe, but he couldn't\nsense them either. The only bronze law\nthat existed within him now was the\nprimordial angel that had just dispelled\nthe darkness for him. A memory floated\ninto my mind. The memory of entering the\nshadow illusion. He remembered. He\nremembered everything. There was no such\nthing as a pure heart or all things in\nthe universe. It's all an illusion. He\nwas completely immersed in the illusion\nof shadows where the bronze coffin, the\nunrememberable beings, and Typho and the\nothers were all fake. The truth is that\nhe never escaped the illusion of the\nshadows. At the time, he thought he had\nsucceeded and felt the shadows hand\ndisappear. So, he opened his eyes. This\ncaused him to break the rules and fall\ndirectly into an endless sea of blood,\ntrapped in a false illusion. Everything\nthat happened after I emerged from the\nshadowy illusion was a lie. He never\nescaped the shadowy illusion. Now he has\ntruly emerged from the brink of despair,\nbecoming the chosen one and connecting\nwith the bronze law primal angel. It was\nthe holy light of the angels that\ndispelled the darkness for him and let\nhim out of the illusion. It turns out\nthat I failed before trapped in the\nillusion and unable to extricate myself.\nBut at the critical moment, my inner\nuniverse erupted and I was blessed by\nthe gods, awakening the primordial\nangel, which allowed me to step out of\nthe illusion. The angel I encountered in\nthe illusion was actually a sign that I\nwas about to awaken as the primal angel,\nSumu murmured to himself, gradually\nunderstanding everything. Am I also the\nchosen one? He frowned involuntarily. He\ndisliked this feeling. He craved\nexcitement and thrills, but the feeling\nof divine intervention when danger\nstruck and all victories depended on\nluck was really boring. Soon, Yong\nDonging, Yion, and the others entered.\nSumu revealed the information about\nTinking from the shadowy illusion. Yianu\nwas delighted and analyzed how to break\nthe nightmare, kill Tinking. Yong Doning\ndisagreed with this approach, but Yion\nwas eventually moved by Yong\nDonging&lt;unk&gt;s kindness and decided to\nhelp Tinking together with everyone.\nThings went smoothly. The primal angel\nworked its magic and Sumu received\ndivine guidance, found Ting&lt;unk&gt;s\nfamily, and finally returned to reality.\nBack in reality, Sumu was recruited by\nvarious companies. He learned from them\nthat the primordial angel was the\nlegendary strongest bronze law, even\nstronger than the precognition of the\nfuture. Not only could it use the power\nof the gods, but it would also receive\ndivine assistance in the dark.\nTherefore, they all wanted Su Mu to join\ntheir companies and even fought each\nother to recruit him. Just as Sumu was\nmaking his decision, the princess of the\nCrimson Flame Empire appeared. She was\nholy, beautiful, and flawless. She drove\naway all the competitors and recruited\nSumu. Later, Sumu began his life as a\nprotagonist in a wishful fulfillment\nnovel. In his adventures through\nnightmare worlds, he relied on the help\nof the gods to grow stronger and quickly\nbecame a gold level expert. He was\ninvincible among his peers and was known\nas the strongest in the empire because\nhe could wield divine power. The\nprincess secretly fell in love with him\nand vowed to marry no one but him. The\nemperor of the empire thought highly of\nhim and promised to bestow the throne\nupon him. Years later, Sumu, the\ngreatest emperor of the Crimson Flame\nEmpire, the world's strongest man, an\nangel incarnate, a God's agent, and the\nonly nightmare apostle in history to\nbreak the nightmare curse, successfully\nstood at the pinnacle of the world and\nlived happily ever after with the\nprincess. On the enormous throne, Sumu\nlooked at the imperial nobles kneeling\nbefore him, then at the stunningly\nbeautiful princess beside him, her face\nfilled with love. He pushed up his\nglasses, his face devoid of any\nhappiness, only filled with endless\nemptiness and boredom. He sighed, \"Ugh,\nthis isn't satisfying either.\" He turned\nhis gaze to the 100 m tall angel statue\nstanding in the center of the palace\nsquare, its silver vertical pupil in the\ncenter of its forehead, shining\nbrightly. \"I know you want me to believe\nin you and prepare a smooth life for me,\nbut can you please put some effort into\nit? I've already done all that before.\"\nThe 100 meter tall angel statue remained\nlifeless, offering no response. Sumu\nfrowned slightly and waved his hand.\nGuards, take down the statue for me. The\nkneeling ministers below all changed\ncolor and kept trying to stop him. Your\nmajesty, you mustn't demolish it. That\nwould be blasphemy against the gods. The\ngods will unleash divine punishment, and\nthe entire Crimson Flame Empire will\nsuffer as a result. Your majesty, angels\nare the faith of the Crimson Flame\nEmpire. If you insist on this, the\npeople will surely rebel. Sumu felt\nincreasingly bored. He slowly raised his\npalm and an extremely dazzling holy\nlight appeared. Then he pressed down\nsuddenly and a huge holy light palm\nappeared out of thin air directly\nenveloping the entire palace. Boom! The\npalace was reduced to ruins and the\nworld fell silent. The ministers died\nand the princess died too. Sumu emerged\nfrom the ruins and strolled to the angel\nstatue. Just as he was about to make his\nmove, the angel statue came to life.\nLike a true angel descending to earth,\nstanding a 100 meters tall with a\ncompassionate divine radiance on his\nface, he looked down at Sumu. Yet his\nsilver vertical pupils held only endless\ncoldness. Mortal, I have bestowed upon\nyou all the riches and glory of this\nworld. Yet you still dare to blaspheme.\nSumu smiled, raised his head, and his\ncrystal blue eyes met the angel's cold\neyes, which were devoid of any human\nemotion. I remember you entered my body,\nand then I passed out, right? The\nangel's voice grew colder and louder,\nlike the voice of heaven. Mortal, answer\nmy question. Sumu remained\nexpressionless, his posture upright like\na pine tree. His golden imperial robe\nswayed slightly in the wind. Beneath his\nhigh nose bridge, his thin lips were\npressed into a straight line. Suddenly,\nthe corners of his mouth curled up\nslightly and a cold smile bloomed on his\nlips. Though the ark was shallow, it\ncarried endless chill and disdain.\nOutside, you call me immortal, and I\ndon't mind. But in my dreams, what do\nyou think you should call me? Boom! A\ntremendous change has taken place.\nEverything in the Crimson Flame Empire\nwas shattered, and in its place rose a\nvast celestial palace. Its celestial\nlight illuminating the heavens, the\nvoids surging and countless laws\ntrembling. Sumu took a step forward and\nendless laws formed a path to the\nheavens beneath his feet, carrying him\nto sit on the Supreme Imperial throne of\nthe Supreme Immortal Palace. His figure\nbecame incomparably majestic, seemingly\nas tall as heaven and earth. A celestial\nemperor's robe was gently draped over\nhis body. Just sitting there was enough\nto make the world lose its color and all\nthings tremble. He radiated a divine\nlight as bright as the sun. And with a\nflick of his wrist, he controlled the\ncycle of life and death in the universe.\nWith a turn of his hand, he dominated\nthe changes in time and space, as if he\nwere the center of the universe and the\nend of all paths. The angels who had\npreviously seemed like gods now appeared\nlike ants in his presence. Chapter 92.\nDevouring divinity. The angel's\ncompassionate face turned\nexpressionless. All the changes around\nhim were beyond his expectations. He\nseemed not to understand why a mere\nmortal could be so high above. Blavur\ndied. He was like a malfunctioning\nrobot. His face as cold as ice and his\nwhole being transformed into a beam of\nholy light rushing straight towards Sumu\nat the top of the world. Sumu sneered\ndisdainfully. He had already guessed the\nangel's intentions. It was nothing more\nthan wanting him to be forever immersed\nin the illusion, to believe in the angel\nand then to control his body. It was\njust a pity that God's imagination was\ntoo lacking. These illusions were not\nonly not beautiful to him, but also\nextremely annoying. If he were in the\noutside world, he might not have a good\nsolution to this level of illusion, but\nthis is his dream world, his home turf.\nThe only one to blame is the angels for\nletting him fall into a coma. Because as\nsoon as he falls asleep, he enters that\nomnipotent dream. He waved his hand\ngently and billions of stars hanging in\nthe universe fell like rain. They\ncrashed madly towards the dazzling holy\nlight. But no matter how the stars\nshattered and the world collapsed, the\nholy light seemed to be the only\nunchanging thing, completely unshakable.\nSumu's eyes flickered slightly, just as\nI expected. Everything in the dream was\nfake, while the angels were real from\nthe outside world. Illusion cannot shake\nreality. He had anticipated this scene\nbecause it had been the same when he\ndealt with the Crimson Nightmare world\nbefore. Illusion could not shake\nreality. Even if his dream was more real\nthan reality. Bang! The holy light\nstruck his imposing body fiercely, like\na leech, spreading wildly across his\nskin. In an instant, Sumu's crystal blue\neyes were tinged with holy light, and\nhis expression became somewhat devout.\nAn impulse rose in his heart, an impulse\nto praise the angel. He knew that the\nangels were forcibly changing his mind\nand turning him into a believer in the\nangels. But Sumu was not alarmed at all.\nInstead, he smiled silently. In my\ndream, although I cannot change the\nexternal reality, I can change myself.\nAs soon as he finished speaking, his\nmajestic body crumbled inch by inch,\ndisappearing into thin air, while the\nholy light flew around aimlessly like a\nheadless fly. Beyond the endless\ndimensions, Sumu quietly watched the\nholy light, examining it with great\ninterest. A god, nothing special.\nAlthough he cannot destroy the holy\nlight, the holy light will not find him\nin the dream. He can divide a dream into\nendless dimensions in the blink of an\neye, while he himself can hide outside\nof those dimensions at will. What should\nI do next? He stroked his chin deep in\nthought. Suddenly, his eyes lit up.\nAlthough illusions cannot affect\nreality, their greatest function has\nalways been deception. Why not try\ndeceiving a god? Then an identical sumu\nappeared before the holy light. This was\na clone he had created, a completely\nidentical clone. The angel was indeed\nfooled. He seemed to lack much\nintelligence and went straight into the\nclone, which was then engulfed by holy\nlight. Sumu could sense that the angel\nwas merging with his clone. \"Aren't you\njust courting death?\" Sumu muttered to\nhimself. He couldn't control the\nexternal reality. But if you insisted on\nmerging into it, then he would have no\nchoice but to accept it. He did not\nallow his clone to resist, letting the\nangel merge with him. Moments later, the\ntwo became one. The clone grew silver\nvertical pupils on its forehead and\neight holy wings like those of an angel\nappeared on its back. Snap! Sumu snapped\nhis fingers and his clone instantly\nvanished into nothingness along with the\nangel, all merging into this dream\nworld. Just when he thought he had\nsolved it, the entire dream suddenly\nchanged drastically. Everything that had\nbeen conjured up before shattered, and\nall things returned to nothingness. In\nthis void, Sumu stood alone. He frowned\nslightly, looking at the emptiness\naround him. A feeling told him that the\ndream seemed different now, but he\ncouldn't quite put his finger on what\nwas different. He tried to conjure up\nthe celestial palace at the top again.\nThe dream quickly changed according to\nhis wishes, and the celestial palace\nsoon appeared. Everything was just like\nbefore, but the feeling in the dark\nbecame stronger and stronger. Suddenly,\na look of realization flashed in his\neyes, and he understood what this\nfeeling was. Reality. After the dream\nmerged with the angel, it gained a touch\nof reality. That magical feeling was\nindescribable. But Sumu truly felt it.\nThe dream and reality became even\ncloser. At the same time, he suddenly\nfelt a sharp pain in his forehead as if\nit were on fire. Whoosh! A huge\nfull-length mirror appeared in front of\nhim, reflecting a tall and slender\nfigure. Pupil had appeared on his\nforehead, its gaze cold and indifferent,\nlike a high and mighty god looking down\non all living beings. With the\nappearance of vertical pupils, some\nmemories that did not belong to him\nflooded into his mind. In a days, he saw\ntwo towering gods fighting. One was a\ndemon with jet black wings on its back,\nand the other was an angel with silver\neyes on its forehead and pure white\nwings. During the battle, the blood shed\nby the two fell onto a dark stone which\nwas stained with blood and eventually\ntransformed into the statue of the two\nbeings, God and demon. Later, the ground\nbegan to crumble from their fighting and\neventually the statue fell into the\nabyss and disappeared without a trace.\nThe second image shows a group of people\nin black and white robes kneeling before\na statue on an altar, then fighting each\nother, their blood staining the\nsacrificial sight. The third and final\nimage shows a small bald monster with\nwings and no eyes or nose. It\ncontinuously releases a thick fog,\nseemingly disrupting some kind of\nbalance. An old wooden door appears in\nthe fog, and the little monster\ndiscovers it and opens it. The scene\nabruptly ended there. Do gods and demons\nreally exist in this world, or are they\njust products of the nightmare world?\nSumu's eyes gleamed with excitement.\nThis is wonderful. The more dangerous\nand bizarre the world is, the more\nexcited he becomes, like a pro gamer who\nis never afraid of a game being too\ndifficult, but only afraid that the game\nis too boring. His eyes gleamed with\nexcitement as he quickly analyzed the\ninformation he had just received. The\nblood of gods and demons had endowed the\nstatue with divinity, and the statue\nmust have been found by some cult, which\nthen built a sacrificial site for it.\nThe sacrificial site is not located in\nthe abandoned city. It was only after\nthe unremembered ones arrived in the\nabandoned city that they inadvertently\ndisrupted a certain balance, causing the\nentrance to the sacrificial site to\nappear in the abandoned city. This all\nmakes sense now. He had previously\nguessed that since the person behind the\nscenes only needed someone whose memory\nwas lost to achieve their goal, why\nwould they need to create a statue?\nTherefore, the statue must not have been\ncreated by them. Now, it seems that this\nwas indeed the case. It was the idol\nreleased by the unremembered one. But it\nwas the idol that trapped it in the\nsacrificial sight. The thick fog it\ncreated which eroded memories was driven\naway by the statue and expelled entirely\nthrough the wooden door. His own dream\nwas also quite peculiar as it could\ndevour the divinity of the statue,\nadding a touch of reality. If this were\nto be deduced logically, wouldn't it\nmean that as long as he devoured more\ndivinity, the dream could become\nreality, become a real world? What\nexactly was this dream? Could it really\nbe a dream that a mere mortal like\nmyself could have? More and more\nmysteries shrouded Sumu, constantly\nstimulating his excited nerves. He loved\nthe unknown and the surprises. Just as\nhe was getting too excited, a sudden\nshaking sensation came, and then the\nwhole dream began to shake violently.\nChapter 93. Silver vertical pupils.\nSumu, are you still alive? Brother Sue,\ndon't die. Bronze coffin hasn't paid me\nthis month yet. I really can't afford to\ngive a wedding gift. Sumu opened his\neyes and looked at the two people in\nfront of him. Stop shaking me. Yong\nDongqing and Jun Wu Shang were\nimmediately overjoyed. That's great,\nBrother Su. You're finally awake. What\njust happened? Where did that statue go?\nSumu slowly got up from the ground.\nAlthough he had fallen to the ground,\nthere was not a speck of dust on his\nbody or even his clothes. This was\nbecause the immaculate heart was\nworking. Now is not the time for idle\nchatter. Let's hurry and leave or the\nsacrificial site will collapse soon.\nWithout wasting any words, Sumu led the\nthree of them towards the outside of the\nsacrificial site. However, after taking\nonly two steps, he suddenly stopped and\nstretched out his hand to Yong Doning.\nGive it to me. Yong Doning&lt;unk&gt;s\nexpression changed and he stammered.\nTake take what? The next moment,\neverything went black and he lost all\nhis vision. Then he felt a lightness\naround his waist. When he regained his\nvision, he found that Sumu had a silver\npistol in his hand. He gave an awkward\nlaugh and scratched his head sheepishly.\n\"I I didn't mean anything by it. I was\njust about to carry you to the hospital,\nbut I was worried the bumpy ride would\ncause the gun to fall off.\" Sumu ignored\nhim and turned to Jun Wuang, saying, \"He\ndidn't say anything about you, right?\"\nJun Wu Shang s face fell and he took out\nfive myth bullets from his towist robe\nand handed them over. Sumu glanced at\nthe two of them. You're already dividing\nup the inheritance before I'm even dead.\nThe two were quite embarrassed, one\nscratching his head and the other\nlooking at the stone at his feet.\nBesides, you're not my children, so you\ndon't seem to have any right to inherit\nmy estate, do you? I All right, enough\nwith the excuses. Given your egregious\nbehavior as the head of the Bronze\nCoffin Intelligence Department, I have\ndecided to confiscate your mission\nbonuses for this mission. Huh? Didn't I\nreturn the things to you? What? Brother\nSue, you're a minister. Quick, this\nplace is about to collapse. As they\nspoke, spiderweb like cracks appeared in\nthe sky above the sacrificial sight, and\nthe sky shattered like a mirror. As he\nran, Sumu looked up at the sky, he had a\nstrange feeling. He felt that this place\nwas very similar to the nightmare in the\nnightmare world. Thinking about how the\nnightmare world would invade the real\nworld, he guessed that this sacrificial\nsight came from the nightmare world.\nThen who were the blackroed and white\nrobed figures who knelt before the\nstatue? Were they people like Tinking in\nthe Nightmare world? Brother Su, which\nway do we run? We can't find the door we\ncame in through. Jun Wuang said\nanxiously. Sumu did not answer, but\nfocused his mind on the space between\nhis eyebrows. The next moment, a crack\nappeared between his eyebrows, and a\nsilver vertical pupil suddenly emerged\nfrom the crack, his gaze cold and\nindifferent. Through his silver vertical\npupils, he quickly spotted the wooden\ndoor hidden in the void. A flash of holy\nlight in his eyes revealed the door.\nSumu, on your forehead. Yang Doning\nstared in shock at Sumu&lt;unk&gt;s forehead,\nhorrified to discover that the eye there\nwas exactly the same as the eye on the\nangel statue. Sumu did not explain, but\nled the three men toward the wooden\ndoor. They were very fast, except for\nXiao Yong, the bald man at the very end\nof the group. However, there are people\neven faster than them, or rather not\npeople, but those who cannot remember.\nThe unremembered being who had been\ntrapped in the sacrificial sight saw the\nwooden door appear, flapped its wings,\nand instantly arrived in front of the\nwooden door, wanting to open it and\nleave. Because the distance between them\nand him was more than 10 m, they did not\nforget the person who could not\nremember. Yang Donging shouted urgently,\n\"Sumu, hurry! Use Mythal bullets!\" A\nlook of helplessness flashed across\nSumu's face. Sometimes having a terrible\nteammate can be really frustrating. If\nMyithil bullets can really kill those\nwho cannot remember, then why do you\nthink that Sonic Man didn't kill it\nbefore? Because he was kind, right? Yang\nDonging was stunned for a moment before\nhe realized what was happening. Just\nthen, the one with no memory pushed the\ndoor open with its hand. It had just\nstepped halfway in when boom, a dazzling\nholy light suddenly shot out from Sumu's\nthird eye. The next moment, the\nunmemorable one was struck by the holy\nlight. And almost instantly, its body\nwas completely annihilated in the holy\nlight and vanished. As Sumu said before,\ndealing with those who cannot remember\nis actually quite simple. Either attack\nfrom a distance or use non-living\nentities such as puppets. Previously, he\nlacked ranged attack methods and was\nunable to deal with those who could not\nremember. But now, it's different. After\nthe dream devoured the angel's divinity,\nhe also gained some angelic power, which\nis the silver vertical pupil that\nappeared on his forehead. Although he\ncouldn't unleash the true power of this\neye, it was still a divine object. And\neven if he could only unleash a portion\nof its power, it was still terrifying\nenough. The unremembered one whom even\nMyithil bullets could not kill vanished\ninstantly under this gaze. However, the\nprice was also very serious. His mental\nand physical strength were instantly\ndrained. Not only that, Sumu could even\nfeel a large number of his cells dying\nand his various organs failing, as if\nhis life force had been forcibly\nextracted. This single blow, while\nkilling the one who couldn't remember,\nalso put him on the verge of death.\nSumu's body fell uncontrollably to the\nground. Jun Wuang quickly grabbed his\narm, hoisted him onto his shoulder, and\nran swiftly towards the door. After a\nlong while, the two vans drove away from\nthe abandoned city area. In the backseat\nof the van, Sumu leaned weakly against\nthe seat. He never expected that he, who\nhad survived so many dangers without\ninjury, would almost be killed by the\nbacklash from the silver vertical pupil\nif lifespan had a numerical value. He\nfelt that this would shorten his life by\nseveral years. For a mortal to use\ndivine artifacts, been this week in a\nwhile since becoming a superhuman, and\nnow, well, he was back in a wheelchair.\nThe front passenger seat was still\nrambling on. Could you please not deduct\nmoney from my pay? I need to buy clothes\nfor Jasmine to make amends. I made her\ncry last time. Or you could deduct less.\nShut up. Didn't you pick up a few\nMyithil bullets? You can sell them for\nmoney. Sumu was too lazy to pay\nattention to Yong Doning. Ever since the\nmoment the people with no memory died,\nall their lost memories had returned.\nYong Doning also remembered that he had\nleft the hickeys on Jasmine's neck and\nthat he had bought her the new clothes.\nHe felt extremely guilty at that moment.\nSumu's memories naturally returned, but\nwhether they returned or not was not\nimportant because he had already deduced\nthe lost memories before they were\nrestored. Chapter 94. Memory recovery.\nBronze Coffin Company. Mungley, who was\nprocessing documents, suddenly stopped\nwriting. A look of confusion flashed in\nher eyes, followed by a flood of\nmemories. The next moment, her\nexpression changed drastically, and she\nabruptly stood up and rushed out the\ndoor. She remembered everything. The\nbronze coffin company once had more than\n20 employees. And there was also a\nsuperhuman named Jun Wuang who was from\nthe longevity dojo, not a nightmare\napostle. His bronze law was the 98th\nranked peerless sword dance. Jun Wu\nShang is a sickopant. It was almost\neffortless to recruit him back then.\nEven with Hanu interfering, he couldn't\nbe driven away. He had once sent Jun Wu\nJang with some nightmare apostles who\nwere ordinary people to the ruined city\nto search for clues about the Golden\nEye. And then nothing happened. Her\nmemory began to fade from here and she\nmistakenly believed that there were no\nsuperhumans in the company. So she began\nto search for them and found Yong\nDonging and Sumu. As Sumu and his group\nreached the abandoned city, she lost her\nmemories of them. Only now did she\nrealize that she had sent people to the\nabandoned city many times, forgetting\neach time and repeatedly sending people\nto their deaths. Damn it, why are there\npeople with no memory in the abandoned\ncity? Zuzu Murley's beautiful face was\nfilled with worry. Not only because she\nwas worried about the great loss of the\nbronze coffin strength, but also because\nshe was worried about Sumu. He was the\nonly man she had never disliked since\nchildhood and the only man who showed no\ndesire in her eyes. She recalled the\nconversation at the dinner table that\nday. Miss Moonley, I always thought we\nwere friends. Friends? Moral. Mley had\nnever had any friends. Her status\ndestined her to be looked down upon by\nnobles and fawned over by commoners.\nNotify the armed forces to assemble and\nprepare the vehicles. Head to the\nabandoned city. Go to the basement safe\nand take out the black box inside. Also,\nif I haven't returned by midnight\ntonight, send someone to the Mong family\nto ask my father for help. Murang\nMungley&lt;unk&gt;s expression was cold and\nstern as she issued instructions\nmethodically. Although she knew that the\nperson with no memory was dead, which\nwas why their memory had returned, she\nstill prepared for the worst since the\nabandoned city was not the only\nnightmare monster, the person with no\nmemory. Moreover, she didn't believe\nSumu could kill the unmemorable one, a\nnightmare monster feared even by silver\nlevel experts. She guessed that other\npowerful nightmares must have killed the\nunmemorable ones and that Sumu and the\nothers might already be dead, but she\nneeded to see him alive or dead. Sumu\nwas her last hope. She didn't have time\nto recruit any more superhumans, and it\nwould be difficult to recruit someone\nstronger than Sumu. Soon, the main force\nwas assembled, and more than a dozen\narmored vehicles stopped in front of the\nbronze coffin company. Murang Mungley\nchanged out of her CEO attire and into a\nspeciallymade black leather jacket. Her\nlong flax and hair flying in the wind.\nSet off. Just as she was about to get\ninto the car, the sound of a car\nspeeding by suddenly came from afar.\nMongley was stunned. She recognized the\ncar. It was the one Sum Mu and the\nothers had driven away earlier. Sizzle.\nThe vehicle breakdrifted to a stop in\nfront of the bronze coffin company,\nleaving a black tire mark on the ground.\nBang! The driver's cab door opened and\nJun Wu Shang revealed half of his body\nlooking at the dashing Murong Mingli\nwith a surprised expression. Boss, are\nyou here to welcome me? Where are the\nothers? Murong Moonly asked quickly. In\nthe car? She stroed forward, opened the\ncar door, and saw Su Mu, pale as a\nsheet, lying weakly on the seat. \"Suzu,\nare you all right?\" Mong Moonly asked\nwith a worried expression. Su smiled\ngently. \"Thank you for your concern. I'm\nfine for now.\" Someone bring me my\nmedicine box. A black metal box was\nhanded to Murang Mlay. She opened the\nbox revealing colorful potions inside,\neach with a label. She quickly took out\na bottle filled with green liquid, open\nthe cap, and brought it to Sumu's mouth.\nThis is a vitality potion from the\nFederal Pharmaceutical Company. It's a\nkind of extraordinary potion that has a\nremarkable effect on the recovery of\ninjuries. After saying that, she\ndirectly fed Sumu a drink. After taking\na bottle of vitality potion, Sumu\nimmediately felt warm all over his body\nas if he had returned to the embrace of\nhis mother. At the same time, his body\nwas rapidly recovering and regaining its\nvitality. Is there any of this medicine\nleft? There are two bottles left. Sumu\nslowly stood up. Please exchange the\nreward money from this operation for\nvitality potions. Okay, we'll talk about\nthat later. The vitality potion won't\nfully restore you. The company has a\nprofessional medical team. come with me\nfor treatment first. Miss Morong,\nactually I also Yong Donging standing to\nthe side raised his broken hands and\nlooked at the vitality potion with great\nlonging. Mr. Yong, I've already promised\nto give these two bottles of vitality\npotion to Suzu. I see that your injuries\naren't very serious and you're made of\nsteel, so normal medical treatment\nshould be enough. After saying this,\nMorung Mongley ignored Yong Donging and\nfollowed Su Mu upstairs. Yong Doning. He\nsuddenly missed Jasmine. Brother Yang,\nare the boss and brother Sue related?\nJun Wuang asked hopefully. Why do you\nask that? Yong Doning looked at the\nother person with surprise. I saw the\nboss call him Suzu. They seem to know\neach other very well. Does familiarity\nmean we have to be relatives? You're\nobviously a single dog. Yong Dongqing\nregained his sense of superiority, gave\nJun Wuang a disdainful look, and then\nwent upstairs with his arms hanging\ndown, leaving Jun Wu Shan alone in the\nwind, bewildered. He was in a daysaze\nfor a long time before suddenly coming\nto his senses, his face full of\nheartache. Sigh. All the flowers I sent\nbefore were for nothing. If I had known\nit would turn out like this, I would\nhave just wasted them on number eight.\nInside the medical room, Murang Mungli s\npretty face was filled with coldness and\nher two fair hands were clenched\ntightly. Suzu, your suspicions are\nvalid. This matter is definitely related\nto the eldest young master of the Murong\nfamily, and Shin Zahi may even be\ninvolved. This is clearly a setup. I had\ntried many times to get Hanu to go to\nthe abandoned city with me, but he kept\nmaking excuses, saying that his father's\norders to him to protect me. Now that I\nthink about it, he probably already knew\nthe truth. Morong Yun Shien Zaheo. Her\ndelicate long nails dug into her fair\npalm from the force she applied.\nMungley, whose face was full of hatred.\nHe knew very well what she was thinking.\nShe had finally had the opportunity to\nset up a company. But before she could\neven show her skills, she was betrayed\nby her own older brother, and the\ncompany suffered heavy losses. Such is\nthe nature of the struggles among\nnobles. There is no brotherhood\nwhatsoever, and they are even more\nruthless towards their own siblings than\ntowards outsiders. It seems that the\ngolden eye is indeed hard to find. This\nyoung master of the Murong family seems\nto have given up long ago and is\nplanning to take another approach to\ndirectly eliminate other competitors.\nChapter 95. Extraordinary potion. Mega\nForce Fist. Murong Moonly shook her\nhead. Although Murong Yun is ruthless,\nhe only dares to target people from our\ncompany. He wouldn't dare to kill\nnobles, even if they are nobles\nthemselves. The life and rights of every\nimperial noble are paramount. This is a\nrule established by all nobles. A\ncommoner who kills a noble, regardless\nof the reason, will be judged by the\nentire Crimson Flame Empire. Conversely,\na noble who attacks another noble will\npay a heavy price unless there is a\nlegitimate reason. Oh, Sumu's lips\ncurled into a smile of interest. It\nsounds like killing nobles would be a\nvery interesting thing. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Moonly\nimmediately looked at him seriously.\nSuzu, please don't have such thoughts.\nI'm not joking. The Crimson Flame Empire\nwas established by the Golden Nobles,\nand they will never allow anyone to\noffend the dignity of the nobles. This\nunspoken rule applies to other empires\nas well. Even during wartime, unless\nthere are special circumstances, enemy\narmies will not kill nobles. At most,\nthey will capture them and demand\nransom. This is a red line that no\nempire can cross. There was once a gold\nranked powerhouse, a nightmare apostle.\nDissatisfied with the oppression of the\nnobility, he assassinated one after\nbecoming a goldranked individual.\nAfterwards, everything about him was\nerased. His family, friends, the faction\nhe belonged to, and everything else. All\nwere forcibly wiped out by the empire.\nThat sounds even more interesting.\nSumu's smile widened. For the first\ntime, he realized that killing someone\ncould be so interesting and that such a\nperson was called a nobleman. You\nMurley's eyes flickered, wanting to say\nsomething more. But then she suddenly\nrealized that this man who didn't care\nabout nobility seemed to exude a\ndangerous charm. By the way, there's\nbeen news about the extraordinary potion\nyou requested. Sumu immediately perked\nup. He had longed for an extraordinary\npotion for a long time. Which one? The\ntype is ordinary. It's the bronze law\nmeggaforce fist. Law potions like this\nwhich can directly help ordinary people\nbecome extraordinary are extremely\nprecious. Even the most common Megga\nForce fist, unending recovery, and iron\nheart are hard to come by. This time, I\nwas just lucky to find one. As for\nhigher series potions, forget about it.\nThese things are impossible to obtain.\nThey are basically monopolized by the\ngreat nobles. For ordinary people to\nacquire them, they can only become\nchosen ones and comprehend them\nthemselves in the nightmare world. Is it\nthe mega fist? Sumu was very satisfied.\nHe didn't mind that the sequence was\nlow. What he wanted was this kind of\nsimple and direct extraordinary medicine\nthat could directly increase physical\nfitness. When will it arrive? I've\nalready arranged for people to keep an\neye on it. As soon as it appears at the\nauction, they will notify me\nimmediately. Oh, by the way, Suzu Murley\nsuddenly curled her red lips slightly.\nYour prize money is quite a lot, but\nit's probably not enough to bid for the\nMega Force fist. But don't worry, I will\nmake up the difference for you, even if\nyou owe me. Sumu raised an eyebrow about\nto speak but was interrupted by Murang\nMungli. I know you don't like owing\nothers but you don't have to treat me\nlike an outsider. Miss Mingli, you've\nprobably misunderstood. I didn't mean to\nrefuse. What I was asking was, could you\npossibly owe me a little more? Mongley\nwas stunned. Besides, Mighty Fist, I see\nyou have quite a few other potions in\nyour medicine box. How about this? How\nabout not good? Murang Munley turned\naway from the bedside, her long flax and\nhair flashing past Su Mu&lt;unk&gt;s eyes,\nleaving a faint fragrance in the air.\nShe walked to the door, paused, and\nturned back to say, \"You should stay at\nthe company and recover from your\ninjuries these next few days. This time,\nyou killed the person with no memory and\nruined Murang Yun and Shinzah&lt;unk&gt;s\nplans. They might target you. With me in\nthe company, they will be more wary.\nAlso, the mark between your eyebrows is\nnice. It looks good.\" Then Morong Mungly\ngracefully departed. Sumu looked at the\nempty ward and touched the space between\nhis eyebrows. Ever since he used the\nsilver vertical pupil, a faint silver\nmark had been left between his eyebrows.\nThe shape was somewhat like lightning,\nbut it was not as sharp as lightning.\nInstead, it looked like someone had\ngently drawn it with the tip of a brush.\nThe traces are very faint, almost\ninvisible unless you look closely, but\nthey are definitely there. On the\nsurface, there was nothing supernatural\nabout it, but only he knew that behind\nthe silver mark was a silver vertical\npupil, the eye of an eight-winged angel.\nIt possesses terrifying power. With his\ncurrent strength, he could barely\nactivate it and immediately fell into a\nnear-death state. This power should not\nbe used lightly unless absolutely\nnecessary. Otherwise, if you miss the\nenemy, you'll be the one who gets\ncrippled first. Although we didn't find\nthe golden eye, the harvest was\nplentiful. It was an eye from a god.\nEven if it wasn't a real god, just a\nstatue, its power was considerable. And\nSumu paused, then waved his hand, and\nthe shadow under the hospital bed stood\nup like a person. The shadow then began\nto wrigle. And the next moment, Siaan\nemerged from the shadow. At this moment,\nSiaan was expressionless, his face\nstiff, and his eyes devoid of any light,\nlike a zombie. Clearly, Siuan Ru and the\nvillagers of Xiao family village were\ncontrolled by the shadowy figure, which\nwas tantamount to them being controlled\nby Sumu. Previously, Ting was the master\nof the shadow. So, the villagers under\nher control acted entirely according to\nTing&lt;unk&gt;s understanding. Now that the\nshadow has a new master, Siaan is\nnaturally under Su Mu&lt;unk&gt;s control. He\ngave Siaan the order and then something\nmagical happened. Siaan, who was\noriginally in human form, suddenly got\ndown on all fours, grew wild doglike fur\non his body. His face protruded, his\nnose turned black, and his teeth turned\ninto canines, making him look just like\nthe legendary dog demon. Sumu became\ninterested and once again manipulated\nSiaan to transform into an eagle, a\ntiger, a lion, a bat, and a snake. He\ndiscovered that Siaan could run a zoo\nall by himself. And the animals he could\nconjure were far stronger than ordinary\nanimals, combining the advantages of\nboth superhumans and animals. As\nexpected of sequence 102, beast mimicry.\nIf it weren't for Buu by directly\ndefeating Siaan, that battle would have\nbeen very difficult to win because Siaan\nwas truly too well-rounded. He was the\nfirst to detect the illusion. And during\nthe battle, he even saw through his own\ntrue form, rendering the myriad\nmanifestations, technique largely\nuseless against him. All things in the\nworld is ultimately a visual illusion,\nwhich has great limitations and makes it\nvery passive against enemies who do not\nrely on their eyes. For three\nconsecutive days, Murong Moonly came to\ncheck on Sumu's recovery almost every\nday, which left him speechless with her\nenthusiasm. Sumu asked her what she\nwanted to do. Mong Mungli, however, said\nthat she was cultivating feelings\nbecause the clues to the golden eye had\nbeen cut off and her father's birthday\nbanquet was approaching soon, at which\ntime she would announce her engagement\nto Chin Zaheo. She knew she couldn't\nchange her fate, so she decided to find\na man before that happened. And this man\nis Sumu. Faced with her honesty, Sumu\nhad nothing to say. After all, she\nhadn't been harassing him. She had just\ncome to visit. On this day, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Moonly\ncame again. This time, however, she\nbrought a silver white metal box\ncontaining several bottles of\nextraordinary potions. Besides the\npromised mighty fist and two bottles of\nvitality potion, there are three extra\nbottles. One bottle of antidote, one\nbottle of sedation potion, and one\nbottle of berserk potion. Chapter 96.\nThe three bronze laws. You didn't take\nthis potion yourself, did you? It's\nclearly not compatible with your\nabilities. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Mungly reminded her.\nSumu nodded. I know. That's good. If\nyou're giving it to Yong Doning,\nremember to make sure he's fully\ndigested the iron will before giving it\nto him. A person's spirit is like their\nstomach. If you eat something that\nhasn't been fully digested, it will\nburst. A strange look appeared on Sum\nMu&lt;unk&gt;s face. Give it to Yong Donging.\nHow did you figure out that our\nrelationship is that good? You should\nget some rest. I have something to do,\nso I'll be going now. After saying that,\nMongli left in a hurry, as if she was\nbusy with something important. Sumu\ncarefully examined the medicines in\nfront of him. Although they were all\ndifferent colors, they were all labeled,\nso there was no need to worry about\ntaking the wrong medicine. The nobles\nreally do have the power after all. He\nsighed with some emotion. Back then, he\nhad gone to great lengths to obtain the\nextraordinary power, using a combination\nof deception and trickery to persuade\nYong Donging, and even went to the\nnightmare world before finally gaining\nit. However, this noble lady, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\nMungli, easily produced a bottle of the\nextraordinary potion, Megga Force Fist,\nin just a few days. \"This is just the\npower of a noble woman's illegitimate\ndaughter.\" \"It seems that when I kill\nMurang Yun and Shin Zaheo in the future,\nI can't forget to take their assets,\"\nSum Mu said casually. Then open the\nMegga Force Fist extraordinary potion\nand drank it all in one gulp. As for\nbeing mentally overwhelmed, it does not\nexist. Hot? It's piping hot and spicy.\nIt felt like I had drunk straight from\nthe broth of a hot pot with beef tallow.\nA surge of scalding heat rose within\nSumu's body, quickly spreading\nthroughout his entire being. In an\ninstant, his fair skin became unbearably\nhot, flushed with a rosy hue, as if a\nraging fire were burning within him. At\nthe same time, his consciousness soared\ninfinitely as if breaking through some\nkind of barrier, and he once again saw\nthe bronze law hidden in endless\ndimensions and omnipresent. At a certain\nnode in this great net, a star descended\nwith light. He has connected with the\nbronze law mega fist. A powerful force\nsurged forth like a tide. Sumu could\nclearly feel his muscles bulging, his\nstrength increasing dramatically, and\nhis entire body containing violent\nenergy. His muscles swelled even more,\nshowing a tendency to change into the\nsize of typhoam, as if he had instantly\ntransformed from a weak scholar into a\nfitness instructor. But then the\nimmaculate heart took effect, and a pure\nwhite light surged throughout his body.\nHis swollen muscles seemed to have been\ncleansed of impurities, shrinking at a\nvisible speed. A moment later, Sumu\nreturned to his original state. He was\nstill tall and slender, but if you\nlooked at his clothes, you would find\nthat his once frail body had developed\nstreamlined muscles, and every inch of\nit contained a violent power. Call. Sumu\nlet out a long breath, his eyes behind\nhis brown glasses gleaming with a faint\nblue light. Is this what power feels\nlike? Or is the improvement of physical\nstrength the most direct? But now that\nI've collected all three bronze laws,\nshouldn't I start preparing to advance\nto silver? It seems like you can't\nadvance with three different bronze law\nsystems, right? It'll cause a mental\nbreakdown. Interesting. I'll try it out\nlater. With the physical enhancement\nbrought by the mighty fist, he no longer\nneeds to worry about the unlimited\ngrowth of his mental power for a short\nperiod of time and can live a little\nlonger, at least until the new year. He\nslowly got up from the hospital bed and\nstretched his body. His previously\nseriously injured body had already fully\nrecovered, partly due to the effects of\nthe vitality potion and partly due to\nthe Megga Force fist. He shook his head\nand suddenly felt a throbbing sensation\nin his head as if it were filled with\nsomething. My spirit is completely full.\nSumu frowned slightly. It seems that\nwith my current mental strength, I can\nonly accommodate three incompletely\ndigested bronze laws at the same time.\nHe didn't pay too much attention to it.\nThe swelling was only a matter for today\nand it would stop once his mental\nstrength increased again tomorrow. Mly,\nit's been a long time. Your beauty has\nonly become more and more captivating.\nCome and try this. This is a scaled fish\nthat I specially brought from the frozen\nsea at a high price. The meat is\ndelicious and melts in your mouth. Every\ngram is worth as much as mithril. Only\nsuch a delicacy is worthy of your\nbeauty. Weighing over 300 lb, Shin\nZahe&lt;unk&gt;'s face was plastered with a\nfawning smile. his small eyes, almost\nsqueezed out of shape by his fat,\nstaring intently at Murang Mungley\nsitting opposite him. Murong Mungley's\nface was as cold as ice. She didn't\ntouch her chopsticks and said directly,\n\"She and Zaheo, immediately evacuate\nyour men from the vicinity of the bronze\ncoffin.\" Shien Zahe&lt;unk&gt;'s smile\nremained unchanged, \"That won't do.\nYou're my fiance. What if someone\ncareless bumps into you? This is\nnecessary protection. Protect.\" Muro\nMungly sneered. No one in the Crimson\nFlame Empire has ever dared to lay a\nhand on a noble. You don't need to\npretend anymore. You were the one who\ndid the things in the ruined city,\nweren't you? Shenzah was slightly taken\naback. What abandoned district? I don't\nunderstand what you're talking about.\nMungly, have you encountered some\ntroubles lately? Tell me. In this small\ncorner of Shingqing, is there anything\nthat I, Shin Zaheo, can't handle? As he\nspoke, he stretched out his large fleshy\nhand to grasp Murang Mlia&lt;unk&gt;s hand. A\nflash of undisguised disgust crossed\nMurong Mong&lt;unk&gt;'s eyes and she\nimmediately stood up and moved away.\nShinzaho, given your relationship with\nMurong Yun. Even if you didn't do it,\nyou're still implicated. Get your people\nout of here immediately. And if you dare\nto lay a hand on anyone from my company\nagain, don't blame me for being\nruthless. Shenzah&lt;unk&gt;'s smile slowly\nfaded. Someone from your company? You\nmean that lowly commoner from the lower\ndistrict? I think his name is Sumu,\nright? You cannot touch anyone in the\nbronze coffin, not just Sumu. Mly,\nyou've really misunderstood me. Everyone\nin Shingqing knows that I, Shin Zaheo,\nalways do things openly and honestly.\nThe bronze coffin is your company, so\nit's practically mine. Why would I lay a\nhand on my own company? If, and I mean\nif, I actually did it, what then? Morely\ns expression grew increasingly cold,\neven revealing a hint of murderous\nintent. Her clear, cold voice carried a\nresolute tone. Then you can wait to\nreceive a corpse on your wedding day.\nAfter saying that, she turned and left,\nher delicate high heels making a cold,\nclattering sound against the ground as\nshe walked away. She and Zaheo squinted\nand stared intently at Murang Mungley's\nslender and sexy back. The half of her\nsnow white calves exposed under her coat\nkept tugging at his heartstrings. \"H!\"\nHe stretched his neck and took a deep\nbreath towards where Murang Mungley had\nbeen sitting. The woman's fragrance\nalong with the aroma of phosphorescent\nfish filled his nostrils and his mouth\nwatered. He reached out his large hand\nand grabbed the whole phosphorescent\nfish from the plate, not caring that the\nsoup dripped down his thick fingers. He\nswallowed the whole fish in one gulp and\nchewed it heartily. A short while later,\nHanu appeared behind him and\nrespectfully asked, \"President Xen,\nshall we withdraw our people? Chapter\n97. It's just murder. Why do I need\nevidence?\" Xian Zahi greedily sucked on\nhis fingers, saying nonchalantly,\n\"Withdraw! Of course, we have to\nwithdraw. Didn't you hear what my fiance\nsaid?\" A hint of hesitation flashed\nacross Han Yu&lt;unk&gt;s face. \"Didn't you\nsay before that as soon as Su Mu left\nthe bronze coffin, you would immediately\nsend someone to kill him?\" \"Snap!\" A\nhard slap sent Han Yu sprawling to the\nground. Shien Zahi&lt;unk&gt;s furious voice\nrang out. \"What's the conflict between\nwithdrawing people and killing Sumu?\nThat pretty boy killed the\nunrememberable person I spent a fortune\nto acquire and he also ruined my\nrelationship with Mangley. He must die.\nWith a look of fear and trepidation,\nHanu covered his face and knelt on the\nground, bowing his head and hurriedly\nagreeing. But his face was already\nfilled with resentment and malice. Damn\nFatso. Do you and Murungly have feelings\nfor each other? Damn it. The day I gain\npower, you'll be the first one I kill.\nBut Chairman Shien, you heard what Miss\nMorong said just now. I'm afraid she\nmight do something drastic. Shien Zahi\nsneered her. Have you ever seen someone\nwho really wants to commit suicide give\nadvanced notice? She has no bargaining\nchips, so she can only threaten me with\nher life. But unfortunately, I know very\nwell that this woman will not commit\nsuicide. She will not die before the\nhead of the Mong family. Han Yu was\nimmediately jolted, his expression\ngrowing increasingly terrified. He felt\nas if he had heard some terrible news.\nShin Zahi stroked the silver ring on his\nhand, recalling the information he had\ninadvertently obtained, and the sneer on\nhis face grew even stronger. \"Go to the\nbronze coffin company and find an\nopportunity to deal with that pretty\nboy.\" \"Huh? Me?\" Hanu was shocked and\npointed to himself. The scene of being\nthreatened by Sumu was still vivid in\nhis mind. He didn't think he could deal\nwith Sumu.\nTrash, Shin Zahi said with disdain. I\ndidn't ask you to kill him. Your task is\nto find out about that pretty boy's\nbackground. If he can kill someone who\ncan't remember, he must have some\nunknown trump card. Didn't you say\nbefore that he had a group of inhuman\nmonsters under his command? I guess his\nabilities are related to puppets. And he\nprobably killed those with no memory\nfrom a distance using puppets. Find out\nhow many puppets he has. Also, find a\nway to lure him out of the bronze\ncoffin. Doesn't he have a gang in the\nlower city? Start from there and make\nsure he leaves the bronze coffin. Once\nhe's gone, Mr. Mu will naturally deal\nwith him. Upon hearing the name Mr. Mu,\nHanu instinctively trembled. Yes, I\nunderstand. However, my strength is\ninsufficient and Murang Mungly already\nsuspects us. If I were to go and\ninvestigate further, I'm afraid it\nwould. Why did I end up with such a\npiece of trash like you? Thump. A thick\nthigh kicked Hanu hard and Hanu cried\nout in pain. He quickly used the force\nto roll several times on the ground to\nmake himself look more disheveled. She\n[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Mongli only has suspicions.\nWithout solid evidence, would she dare\nto attack you? She's just a noble\nwoman's illegitimate daughter. Even if\nshe had a 100 lives, she wouldn't dare.\nDidn't you see she only came to issue a\nwarning today? Even she didn't dare to\nlay a hand on him. Do you think that\nlowly commoner Su Mu from the lower city\nwould dare? Besides, even if an\ninvestigation were to be launched, it\nwould first target Morong Yun. What does\nit have to do with me? Shinszaho. His\ncompany's people weren't the only ones\nnot investigated in the abandoned\ndistrict. Even a fool would suspect\nMurong Yun first. Hanu nodded repeatedly\nin agreement. He thought about it\ncarefully and realized that it made\nsense. Sumu would definitely suspect\nMurong Yun first and at most think that\nShianzah was an accomplice. This was\nShaning District. Without evidence,\nwould a commoner dare to attack the\nrichest man in Shingqing just because of\na little suspicion? The bronze coffin.\nViolent impacts continued to ring out\nand the mannequins in the training room\nwere completely deformed under the\ntremendous force of the blows. At that\nmoment, an employee dressed in work\nclothes working on the bronze coffin\ntrotted in. Leader Hanu has appeared.\nSumu slowly stopped what he was doing,\ntook the towel handed to him, and wiped\nhis hands. Bring him to see me. He\ncasually tossed a towel to an employee,\nthen walked over to a nearby table and\nbegan to drink tea. Not long after, Hanu\nappeared. his face showing a hint of\nnervousness, but he concealed it well.\n\"Mr. Sue, I went back to the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\nfamily to take care of some business. I\ndidn't expect such a big thing to happen\nin just a few days. I heard you were\ninjured. Are you all right?\" Sumu smiled\nslightly and gently put down his teacup.\n\"I'm fine, of course, but someone else\nis in trouble.\" Upon hearing this, Hanu\nimmediately tensed up. Facing Su Mu's\nambiguous gaze, he always felt like he\nwas being watched by a venomous snake.\nDoes Mr. Su find the appearance of those\nwith amnesia suspicious? Sumu nodded.\nThe news about the golden leaf was only\nknown to the Murong family's children\nother than Murong Yun, so there's\nsomething fishy about it. Moreover, as\nfar as I know, the unremembered ones\nalso suddenly appeared in the abandoned\ncity recently. Han Yu&lt;unk&gt;s expression\nchanged. You suspect Mong Yun? Not only\nMong Yun, but also Chin Zaheo. Chin\nZaheo. Hanu was startled. Although he\nhas a good relationship with Murong Yun,\nthere's no reason for him to target his\nfiance's company. You suspect him? Do\nyou perhaps have some evidence? Sumu\nsmiled faintly and shook his head. No, I\nhave no evidence. Hanu breathed a slight\nsigh of relief. It was good that there\nwas no evidence. After all, if this\nmatter were to be exposed, it would mean\nthat Shin Zahei had offended all the\nchildren of the Mong family except for\nMurang Yun. He still needed to rely on\nChian Zaheo to climb the social ladder\nand did not want this big tree to be in\ntrouble. However, Sumu's next words\ncaused his expression to change\ndrastically. But evidence is what's\nneeded to solve a case. What evidence do\nyou need for murder? This Hanu suddenly\nlooked up, but his vision went black as\nhe realized he couldn't see anything.\nThe sudden blindness threw him into a\nstate of panic. At the same time, a gust\nof wind swept up from behind his head.\nblind. Han Yu instinctively tried to\ndodge. But suddenly, the evil wind\nchanged its attack and struck Han\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s abdomen directly. Normally, he\ncould easily dodge such an attack, but\nonly if he could see. The human sense\nthat we rely on most is our eyes. Unless\nwe have received special training. Once\nwe lose our sight, we simply cannot use\nour ears to quickly identify external\ninformation. Sizzle. That was the sound\nof guts being ripped open. A sharp eagle\nclaw pierced through Hanu&lt;unk&gt;s abdomen.\nAh! Hanu screamed in agony, struggling\nto escape backward. Blood and intestines\nspilled out. What would be a fatal wound\nto an ordinary person did not kill him.\nOn the contrary, the recently torn\nabdomen showed signs of healing. This is\nthe bronze law, unending recovery at\nwork. It's difficult to suppress this\nrecovery ability unless you use Myithil\nbullets. However, no matter how fast he\nrecovered, it couldn't match Xiawan's\nattack speed. Chapter 98. The leader\njust told me to live like a human being.\nIn an instant, Sia Kuan, expressionless,\nstruck again. His eagle claws had\ntransformed into bare paws, and the\nthick bear paws carrying immense force\nslammed into Hanu&lt;unk&gt;s legs. With two\nsharp cracks, his legs broke. Then, Sia\nChuanfei stepped forward, his right leg\ntransforming into an elephant's leg. And\nwith two thuds, he crushed the bones in\nHan Yu&lt;unk&gt;s hands. Amidst the\nopponent's shrill screams, he placed his\nfinal foot on Han Yu&lt;unk&gt;s waist,\nbreaking his spine. Now Han Yu was\ncompletely crippled. He couldn't even\nstand up, and even his screams had\nsubsided somewhat. Sumu, who was\nstanding to the side, was still sipping\nhis tea and didn't look at Han Yu once\nfrom beginning to end, as if the other\nperson was not as attractive as the cup\nof tea. \"Ah!\" Hanu screamed in agony.\nThe powerful life force that unending\nrecovery had given him had now become a\ncurse that prolonged his torment. You\ncan't kill me. This has nothing to do\nwith me. I'm a retainer of the Murong\nfamily. Sumu slowly put down his teacup\nslightly surprised and said, \"Nobody\nsaid this has anything to do with you.\nThen why did you attack me?\" Sumu was\nincreasingly surprised. Does killing\nneed a reason? If you want to hear one,\nhow about I make one up right now? You\nYou'll regret this. I'm a retainer of\nthe Mong family and Shin Zaheo is my\nboss. By attacking me, you've offended\nboth the Mong family and the richest man\nin Shingqing. They won't let you get\naway with this. Have you finished saying\nyour last words? Han Yu&lt;unk&gt;s expression\ngrew increasingly terrified, and he\nwrithed on the ground like a maggot,\ntrying to escape. No, no, no. You can't\nkill me. If you suspect me, you can't\nuse vigilante justice. Only the Mong\nfamily and Shinzah can judge me. Sumu\nleaned down, looked at the terrified Han\nYu, and suddenly laughed. You're right.\nOnly they can judge you. Bring him to\nthe detention cell. I want to have a\nserious talk with Mr. Han. The next day,\nHanu left the bronze coffin company with\ngratitude. He wrapped his trench coat\ntighter around himself. The wounds he\nhad sustained were still throbbing, but\nthe injuries had mostly healed. On the\nsurface, he was fine, except that his\nbones had not fully healed. But he\ncouldn't wait for his bones to heal. He\nhad to act immediately to live up to the\nleader's trust. Damn Chin Zahe. Han\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s face suddenly contorted with\nrage. His eyes filled with boundless\nhatred. He felt he must have been out of\nhis mind to choose to be Chin Zahe&lt;unk&gt;s\ndog. He worked diligently, but the other\nparty ruthlessly trampled on his\ndignity. Why is Chian Zaheo the richest\nman in Shingqing just because he's rich?\nI am capable. I am willing to endure\nhardship and I dare to fight. Just\nbecause I come from the downtown area,\ndo I have to endure this injustice? This\nis unfair. Absolutely unfair. The leader\nis right. I will seek justice for myself\nand live with dignity like a human\nbeing. In this state of excitement, Hanu\nquickly arrived at Shin Zahi&lt;unk&gt;s\nmanner. At this moment, Chinahi was\nsitting at the dining table, eating and\ndrinking heartily. Seeing the majority\nof the phosphorescent fish that the\nother party casually threw away, Han\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s eyes became even more\nbloodshot. He couldn't afford this fish,\neven with a month's salary. But Shenzah\nonly took one bite and threw it on the\nground. Shio, who was having a meal,\nasked without looking up, \"Have you\nfound out anything about Sumu?\" Han\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s face grew increasingly\nferocious. He stepped forward and\nreplied, \"It's out.\" \"Oh, I didn't\nexpect you, this piece of trash, to have\nsome use. Tell me, how many puppets does\nhe have? He has no puppets.\" Shien Zaheo\npaused in his munching on a pig's\ntrotder. His short, thick eyebrows\nfurrowed, and he turned to look at Han\nYu, who was bowing respectfully. No\npuppets? Are you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] an idiot? If\nthere are no puppets, then what were\nthose monster gang members you saw\nbefore? A follower? Shin Zaheo was\nstunned. Followers. He suddenly flew\ninto a rage. What [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] followers?\nWhere did all these monster followers\ncome from among the lowly commoners of\nthe lower city? Suddenly, Hanu raised\nhis head, his expression as calm as\nstill water, staring intently at\nShinzah, and said, \"Seriously, a\nperson's background does not determine\neverything. Some people are born to be\nfollowed.\" Shien Zahi blinked in\ndisbelief, as if he were seeing Han Yu\nfor the first time, but he quickly flew\ninto a rage and slapped him across the\nface. \"Did you take the wrong medicine\ntoday?\" Bang! Hanu gripped that fat hand\ntightly. \"You've gone too far. You dare\nto fight back? Let me go.\" Chinahi was\nboth shocked and furious. He sensed\nsomething was wrong. I don't blame you\nfor not understanding the greatness of\nthe leader, but you shouldn't insult the\nleader. Die, fat pig. Han Yu&lt;unk&gt;s face\nsuddenly turned ferocious. His right\nfist suddenly swelled up, his muscles\nbulged like a balloon, and he slammed it\nhard towards Chenzah. Boom. A white\nlight flashed from the bone necklace\naround Chian Zahe&lt;unk&gt;s neck, instantly\nforming a light shield that firmly\nenveloped him. While Hanu was thrown\nback by the light shield and slammed\nhard against the wall. You actually\nbetrayed me. How much did he give you?\nShenzah&lt;unk&gt;s face fell completely. Han\nYu fiercely wiped the blood from the\ncorner of his mouth, stood up again, and\nhis eyes no longer held the cowardice of\nthe past, but only a resolute\ndetermination to move forward. The\nleader didn't give me any benefits. He\nHanu charged forward again, throwing\npunches with reckless abandon. His Megap\nForce fist was pushed to its limit, and\nhe pounded the light barrier with punch\nafter punch, causing it to tremble\nviolently. His fists were quickly\ncovered in blood and gore, but he didn't\nstop, as if he wanted to vent all the\ngrievances and anger he had accumulated\nover the years. Shin Zaheo sneered. I\npaid a hefty price for this treasure.\nMoney, money, money. All you ever talk\nabout is money. Just because you have\nmoney, does that mean you can disregard\nhuman life and trample on other people's\ndignity at will? Shin Zahi laughed\nangrily. I don't know what's wrong with\nyou. Han Yu, don't forget who gave you\nthe job when you came to the upper city,\nhelped you break through to bronze, too,\nand even let you join the Morong family.\nYou traitor, have you forgotten all\nthat? I haven't forgotten. Han Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\nexpression grew even more ferocious, his\nfists revealing white bones. These\nthings were all given to me by you. But\ndo you think I didn't know? Back then, I\nrelied on my own abilities to pass the\nexam and get into the law enforcement\nbureau. It was you who secretly had\npeople ostracize me, frame me, and get\nmy supervisor to fire me. You contacted\nme because you want to place people in\nthe Mong family's household, and because\nI'm a distant relative of the family's\nsteward. Shien Zahe&lt;unk&gt;s face suddenly\ndarkened. Men, arrest him. Soon, a\nflurry of footsteps sounded outside the\ndoor. However, Hanu remained undeterred,\nseemingly having already disregarded\nlife and death. He continued to attack\nthe light shield, which trembled even\nmore violently until it finally snapped.\nChapter 99. Even the richest man in\nShingqing is afraid. A tiny crack\nappeared. Shenzah&lt;unk&gt;s expression\nimmediately changed. Damn it, you bunch\nof useless trash. Hurry up and get over\nhere. Grab him right now. Han Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\ngrin widened, a sense of pleasure rising\nwithin him from Chen Zeo&lt;unk&gt;'s fear.\nYou're scared. You're scared of those\nlowly people from the lower city you've\nalways looked down on, huh? The next\nmoment, a barrage of gunfire erupted\nbehind Han Yu, and mythal bullets\npierced his body one after another.\nBang! He collapsed helplessly, but his\nhead remained raised, staring intently\nat Chian Zaheo, laughing wildly. \"Ha!\"\nSo, even the richest man in Shining is\nafraid. Grasp! Shenzah emerged from the\nlight shield and kicked Hanu hard in the\nface with his big feet, leaving him\nbloodied and his teeth knocked out. You\nlowly commoner. You lowly commoner. You\ndamned lowly commoner. You're nothing\nbut an insatiable dog. Everything you\nhave was given to you by this guild\nmaster. How dare you lay a hand on me?\nHe vented his anger for a while until\nHan Yu was covered in blood and gore\nbefore he finally stopped. Are you more\nsober now? I didn't expect Su to even\ncontrol you. Han Yu&lt;unk&gt;s lips trembled\nas his flesh was mangled and bloodied.\nHis voice was extremely weak, but still\nfirm. The leader did not control me. He\nmade me understand what a person should\nlive for. Huh? Shin Zaheo laughed in\nanger. What's the point of living? You\nlisten to him and now you're about to\ndie. What's the point of living? Han\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s consciousness began to fade and\nhis voice became increasingly erratic as\nmemories of the past few years in the\nupper city district flashed through his\nmind. From initial high hopes to\nsetbacks everywhere to being schemed\nagainst and completely abandoning his\ndignity to become a dog, the final image\nfreezes on the leader's gentle and\nencouraging smile, which is the first\ntime he feels like a human being. I used\nto think that gold would shine wherever\nit went. But the upper city is brightly\nlit even at night. I didn't give up. I\nworked twice as hard. I kept asking\nmyself, \"What am I lacking compared to\nthe people in the upper city? Why do I\nhave to linger at the bottom? Even if I\npass the exam to join the law\nenforcement bureau, I'll still be\nbullied. Everyone wants to become a\nsuperhuman, but what good is it if you\nbecome one? Ordinary people are divided\ninto noble and lowly classes, and so are\nthose who are extraordinary. I'm not\nreconciled. Every time I feel\nhumiliated, I tell myself that one day I\nwill overturn all of this.\nUnfortunately, I later forgot that it\nwas the leader who reminded me of the\noath I had made. Long live the leader. A\nfinal roar erupted from his broken body.\nAnd as if in a final burst of energy, he\ncharged fiercely towards Chienzah. Even\nwith his limbs broken, he did not give\nup. With his last bit of strength, he\nopened his mouth and bit down hard on\nthe fat on Chenzah&lt;unk&gt;s stomach. Ah! A\npig-like scream came from Chinzah&lt;unk&gt;s\nmouth. Kill him! Kill him! Bang! Bang!\nBang! My bullets were fired like they\nwere free, riddling Han Yu&lt;unk&gt;s body\nwith holes until he finally collapsed,\nlifeless. Several people rushed out from\nthe side carrying medical kits and\nquickly bandaged Shien Zahi&lt;unk&gt;s\nwounds. The pain made the veins on his\nface bulge. Sumu, summon Mr. Mu here. I\nwant Sumu dead. Dead now. Shenzah was so\nangry that he lost his mind. He never\nexpected that Sumu would use such\nstrange and bold methods. Before he\ncould even make a move against him, Sumu\nhad already attacked him first. How dare\nhe, a mere lowly commoner from the lower\ncity. How dare he? Dusk. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Mungli\nsuddenly arrived at the door. At this\ntime, Sumu had already left the ward and\nwas reading a book in his own office.\nReading is a habit he developed in his\ndreams. He reads all kinds of books,\nespecially those he has never read\nbefore because not reading before\nrepresents the unknown. Murungi pushed\nopen the door about to speak when she\nsaw Sumu reading quietly and suddenly\npaused. The tranquil moonlight shone on\nhim as if he were draped in a mysterious\nglow, making one reluctant to disturb\nhim. Suddenly, Sumu raised his head and\nlooked at Murang Mungley, who was in a\nhurry. He smiled gently and said, \"Miss\nMingley, aren't you off work yet?\nIt's&lt;unk&gt; so late.\" Murang Mungley took\na deep breath, shaking off the random\nthoughts that had entered her mind, and\nsolemnly asked, \"Did you do what\nhappened to Hanu?\" Sumu nodded, not\ndenying it. \"It's me.\" Moronly s\nexpression turns serious. You were too\nimpulsive. As the richest man in\nShingqing, Shianzah is surrounded by\nexperts and possesses countless\ntreasures. Hanu alone cannot kill him.\nMy inside man told me that Shin Zahi is\nnow furious and has decided to take\nrevenge on you. Oh, Sumu's lips curled\ninto a smile of interest. Is it finally\ncoming? To be honest, I never expected\nHanu to be able to kill Chin Zahi. Then\nwhy? Because I'm bored. under Murong\nMungly s puzzled gaze. Su Mu said\ncalmly. I've been out of the abandoned\ncity for three days now. Shin Zaheo made\nme wait for too long and I really\ncouldn't wait any longer. Mongli was\nstunned, never expecting that this was\nSu Mu&lt;unk&gt;s reason. Did he think life\nwas too mundane and needed to find some\nexcitement? Suzu, do you know what\nyou're doing? These past few days, I\nfirst leaked information about the\nperson with the missing memory to the\nother children of the Murong family,\ninstructing them to fight amongst\nthemselves against Murang Yun,\npreventing him from intervening. Then I\nwent to Chin Zaheo to stop him from\nmaking any rash moves. But you shu Sumu\ngently put his finger to his lips and\nwhispered. Missingly, I am very grateful\nfor everything you have done, but please\ndo not interfere with my decision.\nSometimes constant compromise doesn't\nbring peace. It only escalates the\nsituation. Besides, I've learned from\nHanu that Shianzeo is the real\nmastermind. Since he's chosen to attack\nme, I have no choice but to retaliate.\"\nThe gentle voice carried an undeniable\ndoineering air. For some reason, Murong\nMoon&lt;unk&gt;s heart raced, and the words\nthat were on the tip of her tongue were\nultimately swallowed back down.\nSuddenly, Murang Mungley smiled and\nsaid, \"You're right. My mother once said\nthat when a man makes a decision whether\nit's right or wrong, it means that he\nhas made all the preparations and is\nwilling to pay any price for it and the\npeople around him can only support him,\nnot question him. You have a wonderful\nmother. Yes, I've always thought so.\nChapter 100 Silver Treasure Crimson\nHeart. Murang Mi slowly walked to the\ndesk and sat down next to Sumu. Since\nyou have made your decision, I will\nnaturally support you. You are a member\nof the bronze coffin. Shenzah is wary of\nmy noble status and will definitely not\ndare to do anything openly. He can only\nsend assassins in secret. As far as I\nknow, he has three silver level experts\nby his side, but he can only use one at\npresent. The other two are guarding the\nMyithil mine and rarely leave, and the\nother is in another city, cooperating\nwith Chin Zahe&lt;unk&gt;'s Chamber of\nCommerce to carry out business.\nTherefore, the only person he could use\nwas Mu Chong, who was extremely\nmysterious. Rumor had it that he wasn't\na superhuman, but rather a cyborg.\nCyborgs. Sumu raised an eyebrow. The\nterm brought to mind many things. That's\nright, a cyborg and a myithal alloy\ncyborg at that. Cyborg technology is no\nsecret in the upper city, but most small\ncompanies simply can't afford it. The\namount of money required to create a\nqualified cyborg is enormous. Rumor has\nit that Muengs body is completely\ncovered in mythil alloy, an extremely\nstrong alloy with defensive capabilities\ncomparable to the silver law power\nservant. Furthermore, he is said to be\nequipped with numerous lethal weapons,\nmaking him incredibly destructive. The\npower of technology, Sumu was already\nstarting to look forward to it. He had\nseen many superhumans, but he had never\nseen a cyborg before. Many ordinary\npeople who have no hope of becoming\nextraordinary or extraordinary\nindividuals who have no hope of\nadvancement will choose to take the path\nof cyborgs to improve their strength. As\nlong as they are willing to spend money,\ntheir strength can be rapidly improved\nin a very short period of time. Full\nbody modification or partial\nmodification. Partial modification is\nnot feasible with current technology.\nIt's just a concept. uploading a\nperson's consciousness to a computer and\nthen installing the computer on the\nmodified body to achieve immortality of\nconsciousness or mechanical ascension.\nBut that's not realistic. Most cyborgs\nonly replace an arm or a leg, while more\nadvanced ones replace all their skin,\nmuscles, and bones with machines,\nleaving only their internal organs and\nbrain. Mu Chong was the latter. Mongly\npaused for a moment. Suzu, I've told you\neverything I know. What are you planning\nto do next? Sumu smiled slightly. Of\ncourse, we need to leave the bronze\ncoffin and lure Muing out. The enemy is\nin the dark while we are in the light.\nHow can we make a move if we don't lure\nhim out? Are you confident? Murong Mung\nLe's face showed a hint of worry. Much\nChong, a myithal alloy cyborg, has\nalmost perfect defense. Unless a silver\nlevel expert takes action, it will be\nvery difficult to break through his\ndefense. If you have to be absolutely\ncertain before doing anything, you will\naccomplish nothing. You want to find the\ngolden eye, right? Then you must deal\nwith Chian Zaheo&lt;unk&gt;'s people first.\nOtherwise, he can trip you up once and\nhe can do it again. Upon hearing the\nwords golden eye, Murong Moon&lt;unk&gt;'s\neyes dimmed slightly. Actually, I've\nalready given up hope. There's no time\nleft. In another week, it will be the\nMurong family heads birthday banquet,\nwhich is also the day he announces his\nengagement. If the news from the\nabandoned city were true, perhaps there\nwould still be a chance. But now, in\ncontrast to her pessimism, Sumu did not\nthink so. He smiled gently and said,\n\"Haven't&lt;unk&gt; you heard that\nthere&lt;unk&gt;'s always a way out until the\nvery last moment. Who can say for sure?\"\nSumu's gentle smile seemed to have\ntouched Murang Mungly, and a glimmer of\nlight returned to her clear eyes.\n\"You're right. The outcome is still\nuncertain until the very last moment.\"\nShe leaned forward slightly, her\nstunningly beautiful face drawing ever\ncloser, her eyes fixed intently on Sumu.\nSuzu, what have you thought about that\nmatter? Sumu frowned slightly. What is\nit? It is Murong Mly bit her red lips\nlightly, a blush rising to her face as\nif she was somewhat reluctant to speak.\nIt is what I told you before that I need\nto find a man. Why are you so fixated on\nthis? Stop asking. Just tell me if it's\nokay or not. No, why not? Because I'm\nbored. Muron Mungly was taken aback, a\nstrange look in her eyes. You wouldn't\nbe, Miss Mingly. I can sense that you\nare hiding something from me which is\nnot your usual style. Sumu narrowed his\neyes, his deep gaze seemingly able to\nsee through people's hearts. Murungly\nseemed to deflate, slowly leaning back\nin her seat, a bitter smile appearing on\nher lips. I do have reasons I can't say.\nYou are the only man I find pleasing to\nthe eye. So, I think if we have to do\nthis, you are the best choice. And\nyou've been targeted by Chin Zaheo. You\ncould die at any moment. I'm worried.\nAre you worried that if I die, I won't\nbe able to find another man I find\nattractive? Murong Moonly nodded very\ndirectly. Sumu was somewhat puzzled as\nto what exactly made Murong Moonly so\ninsistent on having sex. Never mind,\nit's not important. Compared to Mong Mly\ns little secret, he's more looking\nforward to Mu Chong. Don't worry, I\nwon't die. Sumu&lt;unk&gt;s tone remained\ngentle, but his words carried an\nundeniable confidence. Morong Mly fell\nsilent. After a long while, she\nstretched out her delicate hands, which\nwere like works of art, and ran them\nthrough her loose flax and hair to the\nback of her neck. She removed a silver\nnecklace made of mithril with a small,\nexquisite pendant on it, a ruby that\nshimmerred with an eerie luster under\nthe moonlight. I'll lend you this\nnecklace. Sumu glanced at the ruby\nnecklace, a thought flickering in his\nmind. Is this a treasure? Murang Mungly\nnodded, her gaze towards the necklace\ncarrying a hint of nostalgia. A silver\ntreasure, crimson heart, capable of\nwithstanding one attack from any level\nbelow gold rank. It can be used\nrepeatedly with a one-day cool down. You\ndon't worry about me. Mongly smiled. A\nnoble status is more useful than a\nsilver treasure. Are there any other\nnoble fantasms? [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Mly. The smile she\nhad just displayed instantly turned\ncold. She casually tossed aside the\ncrimson heart, then coldly stood up and\nwalked towards the door. After half of\nher body had stepped into the doorway,\nshe paused again and coldly left behind\na sentence. Don't die. Then they left\ncompletely. Sumu didn't care about\nMurang Mungly s displeasure. He was just\nhappy to have acquired a new silver\ngrade treasure. He picked up the crimson\nheart. The delicate necklace still\ncarried a faint warmth. It can withstand\nany attack below the gold level once a\nday, a good treasure. He then put the\ncrimson heart around his neck, the ruby\npendant slowly disappearing beneath his\ncollar. Chapter 101. The arrival of\nsilver rank powerhouses. Night. Wearing\na black overcoat and carrying a\nsnakeskin cane, Sumu left the company\namidst the farewells of the people in\nthe bronze coffin. At the main gate, a\nlow-key yet luxurious black sedan was\nparked. Upon seeing Sumu emerge, a man\nin black quickly opened the car door and\ninvited him inside. Soon, the car drove\naway. Half an hour later, Sumu quietly\nleft the bronze coffin through the side\ndoor, his figure slowly blending into\nthe night. The previous Sumu was merely\na clone he created using the myriad\nmanifestations of the world. This time,\nhe'll be facing a cyborg comparable to a\nsilverranked expert, so he must be fully\nprepared. He seeks thrills, but he's not\nlooking for death. Soon, Sumu got into a\nblack sedan driven by a member of the\nViper gang whom he had arranged in\nadvance. Let's drive. Before long, the\nvehicle left the upper city district and\nheaded straight for the 13th district.\nSumu admired the scenery outside the\nwindow, watching the brightly lit urban\narea gradually receded into the\ndistance, his mind constantly pondering\nhis next plan. He has three things to\ndo. First, I need to return to district\n13 to develop my influence. My initial\ngoal is to become the underground\nemperor of the entire lower city. It\nwasn't for the enjoyment of power, but\nfor the money. This trip to the upper\ncity made him realize the importance of\nmoney. With his current assets, it would\nbe difficult for him to even buy a\nbottle of extraordinary potion. In the\nend, it was Morong Mungley who funded\nit. Secondly, we need to go back and\nmake arrangements to try and take\nadvantage of the terrain to kill Mu\nChong. Thirdly, it is to help Mong\nMingly find the golden eye as much as\npossible. The noble status is very\nuseful. If an illegitimate daughter has\nsuch power, then once she takes control\nof the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] family, she will provide\nunimaginable assistance to herself. Just\nas he was pondering this, his phone rang\nand he answered it. Chief, I am not in\nany danger. Making the call was the\nunderling who had left with his clone\nearlier. Okay, I understand. Sumu hung\nup the phone, frowning slightly. Were\nthey not targeting the clone? Is it\nbecause Chian Zaheo hasn't yet allowed\nMuing to make a move? Or does the other\nparty possess some means to see through\nillusions? The fact that the clone\nfailed to lure Muing out made things\neven more interesting. Sumu's lips\ncurled into an interested smile.\nSuddenly, he realized that the scenery\noutside the window was wrong. This was\nnot the way back to District 13 at all,\nbut led to a desolate wilderness. He\nnarrowed his eyes and silently pulled\nout a pistol from his waist, aiming it\nat the head of his henchmen who was\ndriving. Bang! The gun fired, but the\nsound was wrong. It wasn't the sound of\na bullet piercing a skull, but rather\nthe sound of metal clashing, like two\npieces of metal hitting each other. On\nthe back of the younger brother's head,\nthe hair that had been hit by the bullet\nhad fallen off, revealing the silver\nmetal skull underneath. Click, click.\nThe sound of gears turning filled the\nair, and the younger brother's neck\ninvoluntarily turned 180\u00b0, staring\ndirectly at Sumu in the back seat. The\noriginal human face had completely\ndisappeared, replaced by a silver white\nmetallic face resembling a skull where\nthe human eyeballs used to be. Two\nmetallic prosthetic eyes that glowed red\nwere placed. Sumu, you can't escape.\nEscape? I've finally waited for you,\nMuch Chong. Sumu smiled slightly, put\naway his gun, and leaned back in his\nseat, looking relaxed and at ease. Much\nlooked at Sumu, who was smiling in the\nseat, and was slightly surprised. You\ncan still laugh when you're about to\ndie. You're quite a character. It's just\na pity that Shin Zahi said he would\ntorture you to death. I can't give you a\nquick death. Get out of the car.\nScreech. The vehicle screeched to a halt\nin the pitch black wilderness. Sumu and\nthe car did not move. A strange red\nlight flashed in Muengs eyes. It seems\nyou still don't understand the\nsituation. As he spoke, he reached out\nhis hand to Sumu. At this moment, Sumu\nsmiled and shook his head. You're wrong.\nIt's you who can't see the situation\nclearly. Sizzle. The sound of the fuse\nburning rang out and a pungent smell of\ngunpowder filled the air. Mu Chong\nsensed something was wrong and was about\nto leave when boom, a massive burst of\nflames shot into the sky, instantly\nshattering the black sedan Sumu was\nriding in and engulfing Mu Chong in the\nflames as well. A moment later, a robot\nwith a cold metallic sheen emerged from\nthe flames. Flames were still burning on\nits body, and its artificial skin was\nbeing burned away inch by inch,\nrevealing more and more of its silver\nmetal skeleton. \"Sumu,\" Mu Chong\nmuttered to himself, a cruel smile\ncreeping across his cold, mechanical\nlips. \"Why can't the scum of the lower\ncity just obediently die?\" He stroed\naway and disappeared into the darkness.\nThe headquarters of the Viper gang. The\nreal Sumu was leisurely swirling the red\nwine in his glass, a playful smile on\nhis lips. intriguing that he wasn't\nfooled by the clone, but instead went\nafter the subordinate impersonating me.\nActually, the sumu who was just blown up\nwas also a fake. It was a member of the\nViper gang with Sumu's face on his body.\nIt wasn't a disguise technique, but a\nface created using the myriad\nmanifestations of the universe. Knowing\nthat Mu Chong was a cyborg, he naturally\nthought of the technological means he\nmight possess, such as an infrared\nimager. This kind of instrument can\ndetect a person's vital signs. Under\nsuch high-tech means, the effect of all\nthings in the universe is greatly\nreduced because it cannot conjure up the\ntemperature of a human body. To prevent\nthis from happening, the real Sumu had\nalready changed his appearance and\nquietly left the upper city, blending in\nwith the employees of the bronze coffin\nwho were leaving work. Chief, everything\nis arranged. Xiao Xiao jogged over and\nsaid, \"Very good. Let's prepare to\nwelcome our guests.\" Mu Chong didn't\nkeep Sumu waiting for long. He had just\nfinished drinking half of his red wine\nwhen a loud bang came from outside.\nInside the Viper Gang Headquarters\ncompound, a cyborg covered in silver\nalloy descended from the sky, smashing\nthe ground and creating a deep crater.\nThe metallic prosthetic eye, glowing\nwith an eerie red light, scanned the\nscene. Its silver alloy shell exuded a\nsci-fi feel, making it resemble a cold\nand ruthless killing machine. A group of\nmen in black, armed with guns, surged\nout like a tide, and without a word,\npulled the trigger hard. Their movements\nwere synchronized, skillful, and swift,\nas if they had practiced countless\ntimes. A barrage of gunfire erupted.\nFlames shot from the muzzles, and\nbullets stre like meteors, emitting\nsharp whistling sounds. However, Mu\nChong didn't even glance at these people\nand strode straight into the depths of\nthe Viper gang. The barrage of bullets\nexploded into bursts of light on his\nbody, but it couldn't budge him an inch\nor even leave a mark on the silver\nalloy. \"Is this all you're relying on?\"\na bunch of lowly commoners from the\nlower city. How laughable! Much sneered.\nHe casually extended his mechanical\nright hand, his movements steady and\npowerful. As his arm stretched out, a\ncold light flashed. His right hand bent\ndownwards, revealing a Gatling gun\nbarrel at his wrist. In an instant, the\ngun barrel began to spin rapidly,\nemitting a chilling buzzing sound, and\nflames spewed out like a raging dragon.\nBullets rained down like a storm,\ntearing apart a group of Viper Gang\nunderlings in an instant. In less than a\nminute, the scene was littered with\nsevered limbs and blood, resembling a\nliving hell. Much stepped into the\nheadquarters of the Viper Gang and saw\nSumu sitting comfortably in a chair in\nthe hall holding a glass of red wine.\nChapter 102. All the explosives in\ndistrict 13 are here. You're not Sumu.\nWhere is Sumu? Mu Chong, whose body\ngleamed with metallic luster, said\ncoldly. Sumu, seated on his chair,\nsmiled slightly. Kill me and you will\nnaturally be able to see the leader. A\nboring trick. No matter how many doubles\nyou have, you're still just a bunch of\nants. Much slowly raised his right hand,\nthe slightly reen barrel pointing at\nSumu. Seeing this, Sumu remained calm\nand gently raised the detonator in his\nhand. \"Ha!\" Mu Changeng&lt;unk&gt;s cold\nmechanical voice rang out. The lowly\ncommoners of the lower city are indeed\nignorant. \"Do you think explosives can\ndestroy Myithil alloy?\" Sumu slowly\nrubbed the detonator button with his\nfingers and said calmly, \"Mithril is the\nhardest metal in the world, so\nexplosives can't destroy it. But that's\nonly if your whole body is made of\nmithril.\" A strange red light flashed in\nMuengs eyes, and he nodded in agreement.\nYou're right. I do have some\nsophisticated electronic components in\nmy body. And to ensure flexibility,\nMithril cannot be used at the joint\nconnections. But don't think you're the\nonly smart person in the world. The\nweaknesses of cyborgs that you can think\nof, I, as a cyborg myself, naturally\nknow even better. And I have already\nstrengthened myself to address these\nweaknesses. When I enter defensive mode,\nall vulnerable points will be covered\nwith Mithil. As he spoke, he walked\nstraight to Sumu's stand-in, stretched\nout his silver metal covered hand, and\ntook the detonator. Sumu's stand-in, did\nnot refuse, allowing the other party to\ntake the detonator. You know what? Your\nsmile is really annoying. When the lowly\npeople in the lower city see me, they\ncan only feel fear and awe, not the\nknowing smile you have on your face.\nIgnorance makes you fearless. So, what\nI'm going to do now is destroy your\nignorance. Snap! Much sneered and\npressed the detonator in his hand. Boom,\nboom, boom. The pre-planted bombs were\ndetonated instantly. The world was\nenveloped in a blinding light, and a\ndeafening explosion rang out with a\nmassive shock wave spreading outwards\nwith overwhelming force. The intense\nflames engulfed Mu Chong, but his\nmaniacal laughter could not be\nconcealed. Harumu tremble in the\nshadows. I'll get you soon. What? How\nmuch explosives did you plant? Much\nvoice suddenly turned horrified. He\nrealized something was wrong. There\nseemed to be a lot of bombs. The\nexplosions echoed throughout District\n13, growing louder and seemingly\nendless. Flames shot into the sky, and a\nsmall mushroom cloud rose slowly above\nthe Viper Gang headquarters. In an\ninstant, the entire Viper gang was\nraised to the ground. District 13 is\ndestined to be sleepless tonight as\neveryone has been awakened by this\nearthshattering explosion. In the far\ndistance, Sumu, holding binoculars,\ngazed at the destroyed headquarters of\nthe Viper gang and smiled slightly. Not\nmuch. All the explosives in District 13\nare here. He knew that explosives would\nhardly kill Myithil alloy cyborgs, but\ntalking about power without considering\ndosage was just being irresponsible. It\nwas like comparing a hand grenade to a\nton of grenades. Both explode, but could\ntheir power be the same? District 13 is\nhis territory, and the reason he insists\non returning to District 13 to deal with\nMu Chong is naturally because he has a\ngreat geographical advantage. In\nDistrict 13, he could gather all the\nexplosives in the district in less than\nhalf a day with just a single order.\nKeep in mind that he controlled not only\nthe Viper gang, but also many other\nhypnotized people such as factory\nowners, high-ranking officials in the\ndistrict, and even ordinary passers by.\nIn other words, Mu Chong is not making\nan enemy of Su Mu, but of the entire\n13th district. He once told Mur Lingly\nthat there were no secrets in the entire\n13th district to him, and that was true.\nWhen all the explosives in the area are\ndetonated in one place, the resulting\npower is terrifying. Although it still\ncannot destroy the Mithril, it can\ndamage the delicate electronic\ncomponents inside Muing's body and his\ninternal organs through the impact.\nCurrent technology is insufficient to\ncreate a fully modified human, so Muengs\nbody should still retain organs such as\nthe brain and internal organs. The\nterrifying explosion lasted for a full 5\nminutes. After 5 minutes, the Viper Gang\nheadquarters had long since disappeared,\nreplaced by ruins with fire light\nscattered everywhere. On the ruins, Mu\nChong knelt on the ground. The silver\nwhite metal shell was already charred\nblack and even severely deformed.\nFragile electric sparks occasionally\nflickered at some joints, and wires were\nfaintly exposed. The eyes that had\npreviously flickered with an eerie red\nlight were now covered with dense\ncracks, revealing dim infrared lights\ninside. In the darkness, illuminated by\nthe fire light, a tall, slender figure\nemerged calmly. He wore a sharp black\nsuit, every fold perfectly placed like a\nmeticulously crafted work of art. The\ncollar of his white shirt was slightly\nopen, revealing a small section of his\ndelicate collarbone, shown with a\ncrystal blue light in the darkness\nbeneath her high straight nose. Her thin\nlips were slightly upturned, carrying a\nfaint smile. Her right hand rested on an\nornate snake patterned wooden cane, the\ngold ornaments on the cane gleaming with\na cool luster in the dim light. Sumu\nlooked at the disheveled Mu Chong and\nfrowned slightly. If you died so easily,\nthat would be really boring. Mu Chong\nremained motionless as if he were truly\ndead. Bang! A mythal bullet shot out\nfrom the silver rose in Su Mu&lt;unk&gt;s\nhand, aimed directly at Muengs head.\nAlmost the instant the gunshot rang out,\na flash of dim red light appeared in\nMuengs eyes. He turned his head\nstrangely and dodged the shot. He slowly\nstood up, his body crackling with\nelectrical bursts. Sumu raised an\neyebrow. Seeing that Mu Chong was still\nalive, he was excited. But he also\nrealized that Mu Chong was probably a\nfully modified human. Otherwise, if the\nother party really had internal organs,\nthe impact of the explosion just now\nwould definitely have shattered them.\nBut Muron Lingley said that the current\ntechnology is not enough to support the\nemergence of fully cyborgs. Is her\ninformation too outdated? Sumu, you\nreally deserve to die. Mu Chong, who had\nalready stood up, stared intently at Su.\nHis cold, mechanical voice revealed a\nstrong killing intent. If he had only\nbeen doing this to complete the task\nassigned by Chin Zaheo before, now it\nhad nothing to do with the task at all.\nDo you know how much it cost me to\ncreate this body? It's an amount you'll\nnever see in your life, and now you've\nactually damaged it. The reward for this\nmission isn't even enough to cover the\nrepair costs. Tell me, do you deserve to\ndie? Sumu shrugged. If you die,\nwe&lt;unk&gt;ll save on repair costs, right?\nDie. Mu Chong, his body severely\ndeformed, charged towards Sumu in a\nrage. Even though his body made of\nmyithil alloy was damaged, it still\nunleashed terrifying power like a human\ntank, crushing all the ruins and debris\nin his path. Chapter 103 battle against\nSilver. Excitement flashed in Sumu's\neyes. The physical enhancement brought\nby the Megga Force Fist was fully\ndisplayed at this moment. He exerted\nforce with both legs and his figure\nretreated instantly, creating distance\nbetween himself and Mu Chong. The silver\nrose and his hand shot out. Bang! Bang!\nBang! The Mithil bullets gleamed with a\ncold light and whistled out, each one\nangled with extreme precision, all aimed\nat Mu Changengs joints. Mu Chong ducked\nlow, effortlessly dodging the Myithil\nbullets, and in the blink of an eye, he\nwas in front of Sumu. He did not use\nfirearms, but chose to fight handto\nhand. The explosion had already thrown\nhis internal electronic circuitry into\ndisarray, causing some of his internal\nprecision weapons to malfunction. The\ngleaming silver metal arm didn't strike\nSumu. Instead, it hit a broken section\nof the wall to Sumu's right. Bang! The\nwall shattered instantly, and a dark\nfigure lightly touched the ground with\nits toes like a bat in the night,\nleaping several meters to dodge the\nfatal punch. In the midst of the\nrampage, Sumu narrowed his eyes and\nglanced at Muengs metal prosthetic eye,\nwhich was flashing red. He knew that it\nwas an infrared night vision device that\ncould image through the temperature\nemitted by the human body. With such a\ndevice in place, the myriad phenomena\nwas completely useless. However, he\nremained completely calm, only feeling\nexcited, as expected of a powerhouse\ncomparable to a silver level expert to\nwithstand such a massive amount of bombs\nand still be able to see through all\nthings in the universe. It was simply\namazing. This time, I might really be\nkilled. The next moment, Muong arrived\nin an instant. His metal prosthetic eye,\nflashing with an eerie red light,\nentered Sumu's eyes. He threw a punch\nwithout any fancy moves. Sumu did not\ntake the punch headon, but instead\ndisplayed amazing fighting skills. This\nwas a killing technique he had practiced\ndiligently in his dreams for many years,\nbut due to his physical weakness in\nreality, he had never used it even once.\nNow he finally has the opportunity to\nshow his skills. He ducked, his metal\nfist brushing past Muengs hair, and a\npowerful uppercut landed with surgical\nprecision on Muengs chin. However, the\nburst of the mighty fist only caused\nMuengs head to tilt slightly upwards,\nand it did not cause any damage at all.\nSumu seemed to have anticipated this\nsituation. After landing a blow, he\nimmediately changed his posture. first\nnarrowly dodging Mu Chings downward\nstrike, then bracing himself on the\nground with one hand, unleashing the\npower of his arm and waist, spinning his\nbody like a top, and then sweeping his\nright leg hard, kicking Muengs knee\njoint. The area had already been damaged\nby bombs, revealing a dense network of\nwires. With a powerful kick, Mu Chong\nimmediately lost his balance and fell\nuncontrollably. But strangely, just as\nhis body was rolling to the side, an\ninvisible force seemed to smooth his\nbody back up, allowing him to stand up\nagain, completely defying the principles\nof mechanics. Sumu's eyes flickered\nslightly. Taking advantage of the\nmoment, he stepped on Mueng's chest and\nused the momentum to do a backflip to\ncreate distance. \"Are you a superhuman?\"\nSumu asked, but his tone was full of\ncertainty. Not only did the other party\nstand up against the laws of mechanics,\nbut he also encountered strong mental\nresistance when he tried to hypnotize\nhim during a battle. If Mu Chong was\njust a modified human, he could not\npossibly have such strong mental power.\nMu Chong, now firmly on his feet, gave a\ncold laugh. Feeling hopeless, isn't it?\nBut the real despair is yet to come.\nSumu smiled slightly. It's not despair,\nit's excitement. Whoosh! His figure\nsuddenly disappeared, blending into the\nsurrounding darkness. A red light\nflashed in Muengs eyes, and he quickly\ngave chase. But as soon as he stepped\ninto the darkness, a ferocious tiger's\nroar rang in his ears. It was Xiauan,\nwhose entire body was covered in yellow\nand black hair. The powerful tiger claws\nwere aimed at Muengs head. Faced with\nthe sneak attack, Mu Chong was not\nflustered at all and did not even defend\nhimself, letting the other party strike\nhis head. Sizzle. The tiger's claws\ncollided with the myithil skull,\nproducing a teeth grinding, scraping\nsound. After this attack, Siaan lost\nthree of his tiger claws, while Much\nChong was unharmed with only a few white\nmarks on his head. His defense,\ncomparable to that of a power servant,\nwas perfectly demonstrated at this\nmoment. Or rather, it was even stronger\nthan the defense of a power servant.\nBecause the former at least had internal\norgans that could be injured by shock,\nbut Much Chung did not. Bang! A gunshot\nrang out in the darkness. Sumu's last\nmithil bullet shot out, leaving a\nscorching trail in the air as it flew\ntowards Mu Changengs eyes. He would\nstill have a chance if he could destroy\nthe other person's eyes. However, the\nmithril made eyelids resembling metal\nplates quickly fell down directly\nblocking the bullet. The mithil bullet\npenetrated half an inch and became\nlodged in the eyelid, but it quickly\nfell out as the eyelid opened and\nclosed. At this moment, Mu Chong had\nalready grabbed Siaan, and with a slight\nexertion of his metal arms, he directly\nbroke Sia's hands. Sumu&lt;unk&gt;s eyes\nflickered slightly, and he immediately\ncontrolled Xiauan to transform. In an\ninstant, it was as if all the bones in\nSia's body had been removed, making him\nas soft as a boneless person. His body\nlengthened, and his eyes turned into\ncold, dark yellow vertical pupils. Dense\nsnake scales appeared on his skin.\nXiaawuan, now in snake form, wrapped\nhimself around Mu Chong, attempting to\nrestrain him. However, as Mu Chong\nexerted his strength, countless snake\nscales burst open and his skin tore\nopen, revealing fibrous muscles. \"It's\njust like when you're eating fried\nchicken, tearing off a piece of meat\nwith your hands with bits of meat still\nattached, not white.\" Sumu gave a low\nshout, and the shadow beneath his feet\ninstantly stretched out, extending to\nMuengs front. Then the shadows surged\nlike a fountain and a gaunt black figure\nmore than 2 meters tall quickly took\nshape extending a black hand that\nresembled a withered tree branch towards\nMuch Chong. A feeling of strain came\nfrom Bubai. Sumu realized that Bouai was\nunable to forcibly pull the other party\ninto the shadow space. The two were\nlocked in a struggle and Mu Chong was\nclearly in the lead. However, Sumu never\nexpected Bouai to be able to kill a\nsilver level expert directly. He only\nwanted to restrain the opponent for a\nperiod of time. Sumu, I have to admit\nthat as a lowly commoner from the lower\ncity, you do have some tricks up your\nsleeve. You must be a nightmare apostle,\nright? You obtained some strange methods\nfrom the nightmare world, but\nunfortunately, that's all. Mu Chong\nsneered, then suddenly exerted his\nstrength, tearing Sia's body apart inch\nby inch, and Bubai&lt;unk&gt;s body also\ntrembled violently as if it was about to\ncollapse. Just then, the silver mark\nbetween Su Mu&lt;unk&gt;s eyebrows emitted a\nmysterious silver light. And the next\nmoment, the silver mark tore apart,\nrevealing a silver vertical pupil\ninside, cold and indifferent, like the\neyes of a god. When the silver eyes\nappeared, Mu Chong, who had been\nsneering, was suddenly startled because\nhe felt a deathly pressure from them. He\nhurriedly tried to break free, but it\nwas too late. A dazzling silver light\nshot out like lightning, instantly\ntearing through the void and striking Mu\nChong with a hearttoppping force, was\nonce as hard as dragon scales, was like\npaper in front of this silver light, and\nwas instantly pierced. Muing&lt;unk&gt;s\nentire upper body seemed to vaporize and\ncompletely disappear, along with Xiai's\ntorn body and Bubai's arm. Chapter 104.\nDesperate situation. Sizzle. The severed\nlower half of Muengs body revealed a\ndense network of wires with tiny blue\narcs of electricity flashing\ncontinuously, becoming the only\nremaining sound in this world. Sumu\nemerged from the darkness, his face\npale. Most of his weight was resting on\nhis snake patterned wooden cane, clearly\nindicating that the attack had left him\nnearly exhausted. If he hadn't obtained\nthe bronze law, giant force fist, which\ngreatly enhanced his physical abilities,\nhe would have already fainted. Is this\nthe strength comparable to silver rank?\nThis battle made him realize how\nterrifying a silver level expert was.\nAlthough he won in the end, the price he\npaid was enormous. All the explosives in\nDistrict 13 were used up, the\nheadquarters of the Viper gang was\nraised to the ground, Siaan died, Bubai\nlost an arm, and he himself was on the\nverge of collapse. But Sumu had a\npremonition that the battle was not\nover, but rather just beginning. Because\nMu Chong was not simply a cyborg, he was\nalso a superhum. What exactly was the\nsuperhuman power that he never revealed\nuntil his death? Was it because they\nunderestimated the power of the silver\nvertical pupils and therefore didn't\nhave time to use them? Or slap, slap,\nslap. A burst of applause suddenly rang\nout in the darkness, followed by a\nshocking scene. Six identical cyborgs,\ntheir bodies covered in mythal alloy,\nslowly emerged from the darkness. Their\nsteps were perfectly synchronized, and\ntheir silvery white metal shells gleamed\nwith a chilling light under the\nmoonlight. One of them, Mu Chong,\npraised, \"I didn't expect you to be\nhiding such terrifying power, but\njudging from your appearance, it will be\ndifficult for you to use it a second\ntime in a short period of time, right?\nAnd I still have six cyborgs left.\"\nSumu, as I just said, even more despair\nis yet to come. Now, I can't help but\nask, are you desperate? Seeing such a\ndesparing scene, Sumu laughed. A very\nhappy laugh. Why should I be in despair?\nShouldn't I be happy about such an\ninteresting development? Muing&lt;unk&gt;s\nexpression turned cold. As expected, the\nnightmare apostles are a bunch of\ndisgusting lunatics. Killing people like\nyou brings me no pleasure whatsoever,\nespecially since you destroyed one of my\ncyborgs. Why can't you short-live\ncreatures just stay in the shadows and\nwait to die? Why do you have to come out\nand make your presence known? Oh, Sumu\nsmiled slightly. You hate nightmare\napostles? Then how did you obtain your\nextraordinary power? Don't tell me it\ngrew on its own. Humph. Mu Chong snorted\ncoldly. I obtained my extraordinary\npower through the nightmare apostles.\nBut so what? Did I make them become\nnightmare apostles? Blame their bad\nluck. Since it's already destined, they\nshould obediently accept their fate\ninstead of being like you, not enjoying\nthe rest of your life and insisting on\ncoming out to die. Sumu, I've suffered a\ngreat loss because of you. However, your\nillusionary abilities are quite rare, so\nturning you into a puppet will at least\nmake up for it. Puppet? Sumu's eyes\nflickered slightly, and he uttered\nsoftly, silver law, sequence 24, master\nof servants. Mu Chong gave a cold smile.\nYou do have some knowledge. Are you\nsurprised? Hey, servant master with a\nlow rank can possess such powerful\ncombat strength. He didn't even wait for\nSu Mu&lt;unk&gt;s reply and continued, \"This\nis the power of money. People only know\nthat the servant master rank is very low\nand the path to transcendence is\nunknown. They can't advance to the gold\nrank and can only control servants\nweaker than themselves.\" But they don't\nrealize that they are wrong. Controlling\nfully modified humans is the most\ncorrect use of the minion master. Fully\nmodified humans don't know how to resist\nlike controlled superhumans and they can\nbe mass-produced as long as you have\nmoney. Where in the world can you find\nsuch perfect servants? As long as I have\nenough money, I can even build an army\nof cyborgs. So what if I can't advance\nto gold rank? With thousands of cyborgs\nat my command, I am gold. Much was\nclearly in a high mood. Much like\nsomeone who had a huge advantage in a\ngame and was camped in the enemy's\nfountain, typing taunts without actually\ndestroying their base. Sumu could easily\nguess some of Mu Chengs past experiences\nfrom his words. He possessed the silver\nlaw master of servants, but his rank was\nlow and he had no hope of advancement.\nSo, it was inevitable that he would be\nlooked down upon by other silver\ntranscendent beings of the same level.\nIt's estimated that she later met Chin\nZaheo, who owned a myithal mine,\ndiscovered a new world of cyborgs, and\nthen began her life as Chin Zaheo's\nlackey, saving money to create cyborgs.\nNow he completely understood why the\nprevious bombs hadn't killed Much Chong.\nIt was because Mu Chong was a completely\nmodified human with all his internal\norgans discarded, meaning he had no\nweaknesses inside or out. Morely s\ninformation was correct. The level of\ntechnology was indeed insufficient to\ncreate a completely modified human.\nAfter all, a modified human still has\nthe word human in his name and is\ncontrolled by a human. A person without\ninternal organs is a dead person and\ncannot be controlled. However, Much\nChong combined the power of the master\nservant with technology and used his\nextraordinary power to control a\ncompletely modified person which can be\nconsidered to be at the forefront of\ntechnology. You can't compare to the\ngold level superhumans. They don't need\nto fight against an army of cyborgs.\nThey just need to carry out a\ndecapitation plan and kill you, the\ncontroller. Sumu kindly pointed out the\nflaw to him. Much was not appreciative.\nInstead, he sneered. Do you think I\ndidn't think of that? I abandoned my own\nbody long ago and parasetized my soul in\na cyborg. As long as there is one\ncyborg, I will never die. Flesh and\nblood are weak and feeble, while\nmachinery soarses to new heights. Sumu\nwasn't surprised. He had already guessed\nMuengs plan. Since he admired cyborgs so\nmuch, he would definitely try to modify\nhimself. He had read the description of\nthe servant master s abilities and knew\nthat the servant master could paracetize\nhis soul in his servants or even\ntransfer it within his servants.\nBrilliant. As expected, everyone has\ntheir own shining points and yearns for\nan extraordinary life. Even as a\nlow-ranking silver tier one, he still\nhas a heart that longs for gold. Sumu\nclapped and praised him. He admired\nMuengs courage to abandon even his\nphysical body for his ambition. True\nstrength is never stingy with praise for\none's enemies. Sometimes enemies are the\nbest mirror to reflect oneself. What\nkind of person you are determines what\nkind of enemies you will encounter.\nFaced with Sumu's praise, Mu Chong\nshowed a disdainful look. Sumu, I know\nyou are stalling for time, but I don't\ncare. In the face of absolute power, all\ntricks are useless. True despair is when\nyou are fully prepared, but still cannot\nchange the outcome of failure. I'm\ngiving you time to prepare. All you need\nto do is to spare. Sumu smiled\nhelplessly, realizing that the other\nparty had misunderstood. Actually, I\ndon't need to prepare time. I'm just\ncurious because it's the first time I've\nmet someone like you who has given up\ntheir body. Oh, so you're saying you're\nprepared to die? Much Chung sneered as\nsix cyborgs shimmering with silver light\nslowly surrounded Sumu. Sumu shook his\nhead slightly, his tone unusually calm\nand composed, as if stating an\nundeniable fact. You can't kill me.\nChapter 105. Trump card. Mu Chong\nimmediately flew into a rage. I'd like\nto see how long you can keep up your\nconfidence. The next moment, the six\nmyithal alloy cyborgs tightened their\nencirclement, moving slowly towards\nSumu, as if deliberately putting\npressure on him, trying to see the fear\nof despair on his face to satisfy Muengs\ntwisted mind. However, they were\ndestined to be disappointed. Sumu smiled\nslightly, elegantly extended his palm\nand grasped the invitations sent by\nBouai. The two hands, one black and one\nwhite, clasped tightly in the air. Mr.\nMu, your methods and your story have\ngreatly pleased me, so I've decided to\ngive you a surprise. Please don't\nrefuse. Mu Chong felt a growing unease.\nQuickly, grab him. The six Myithil\ncyborgs rushed forward, and then they\nmissed. Sumu was nowhere to be seen.\nOnly a dark inky shadow remained. Yes,\nSumu has escaped into the shadowy space\nof Bubai. The shadowy space of Boui is\nnot only for killing but can also be\nused to escape powerful enemies.\nSumu amidst the ruins, Mu Chong roared\nfuriously. He was absolutely livid. He\nthought victory was in his grasp, but\nthe opponent had escaped right under his\nnose. It felt like deliberately not\npushing the base in a game, typing\ntaunts, and then getting the game turned\naround. If he hadn't already transformed\nhimself into a cyborg with no face, his\nface would probably be burning with pain\nright now. Sumu, if you have the guts,\ndon't ever come out again. I'll stay\nhere and guard you. Muching thought\nfiercely. The six of them formed a\ncircle and stared intently at the figure\non the ground, Su Mu&lt;unk&gt;s shadow. He\nguessed that Su must be hiding in the\nshadow. Otherwise, why would the shadow\nremain even though the person\ndisappeared? Muing&lt;unk&gt;s guess was\ncorrect. Although Bouai could help Sumu\nescape into the shadow space, don't\nforget where the exit of the shadow\nspace is. Right in Sumu's shadow.\nHowever, what Muin didn't know was that\nSumu entered the shadow space not to\nhide, but to prepare a big surprise for\nhim. In the shadowy space, Sumu took out\na bottle of vitality potion from his\npocket, drank it all in one gulp, and\nhis previously consumed physical\nstrength was quickly restored. He didn't\ntake drugs to use the silver vertical\npupil again. it wouldn't have mattered\nanyway. Much soul could transfer between\nthe six modified humans, which meant\nthat unless all the modified humans were\ndestroyed at once, he couldn't be killed\nat all. With the current power of the\nsilver vertical pupils, it can only\ndestroy one body. His real killer move\nwas never the silver vertical pupils,\nbut the dream. Since absorbing the\ndivinity of the angel statue, his dreams\nhave gained a touch of reality. During\nhis rest days, he has been constantly\nexploring the changes that this touch of\nreality has brought to his dreams.\nPersistence pays off, and he finally\ndiscovered that this experiment had a\nreal effect. Feeling that his body had\nalmost recovered, Sumu began the next\nstep. He slowly walked into the depths\nof darkness without taking Bubai's hand.\nHe is now considered Bubai's master and\nfeeds him everyday, so he doesn't need\nto worry about breaking the rules and\nbeing attacked by Bubai. Soon, Sumu\nstopped in his tracks. A person appeared\nin front of him, a person with closed\neyes, a blank expression, standing in\nplace like a zombie. Judging from the\nperson's slightly trembling body, he had\nobviously been standing there for a long\ntime. The man, dressed in a white shirt,\nwearing gold- rimmed glasses, and\nslightly balding, was none other than\nXiao Yong, the nightmare apostle of the\nBronze Coffin Company. Xiao Yong Xiang\nis the only ordinary person who survived\nin the abandoned city, and he is also\nthe one who is about to enter the\nnightmare world. When Moringi first met\nZiao Yong Xiang in the bronze coffin,\nthe middle-aged man appeared nervous,\nsaying that he had already sensed the\ncall of the next nightmare world and\nneeded enough money to buy a magic\nweapon and then asked Mongli to add more\nmoney. It was at that time that Sumu\nnoticed Xiao Yong Xang. He really liked\nthe nightmare world, but under normal\ncircumstances, it would take at least a\nmonth for a nightmare apostle to sense\nthe next call of the nightmare world.\nThat was too long, and he couldn't wait\nthat long. So he thought of finding an\nopportunity to follow Xiao Yong Xiang\ninto the nightmare world. This is why\nSumu specifically protected Xiao Yong\nXiang in the abandoned city area because\nXiao Yong Xang equals nightmare world\nticket. After learning that Mu Chong was\ncoming to kill him, he hypnotized Xiao\nYong Xang early on, preventing him from\nfalling asleep and pulling him into the\nshadow space. All for this moment, Mu\nChong is now guarding the entrance to\nthe shadow space, which was exactly what\nSumu had expected. He couldn't possibly\nbe without a backup plan and Xiao Yong\nXang was his backup plan. He could enter\nthe nightmare world through Xiao Yong\nXiang in the shadow space. Sumu began to\nhypnotize himself and after a moment he\nfell asleep and slowly entered a dream.\nThis time the dream contained nothing\nbut emptiness. This is the most normal\nstate of a dream. As long as he doesn't\nmanipulate it, the dream will present an\nemptiness where nothing exists. Sumu\nstood in the void. With a wave of his\nhand, the void before him dispersed,\nrevealing the scene of the real world.\nOn the ruins, an enraged Mu Chong was\ncrouching, surrounded by six myithal\nalloy cyborgs who stared intently at the\nshadows on the ground. This is one of\nthe additional abilities that dreams\ngain after merging with divinity. It's\nas if the connection with the real world\nhas been strengthened, allowing one to\nsee reality through dreams. The enhanced\ndream also has a second ability to\nforcibly pull the consciousness of\nothers into the dream coffin. He\nattempted to pull the ordinary employees\ninside into his dreams. Although he\nencountered great obstacles, he\neventually succeeded. The obstacle comes\nfrom the physical body which is a\nbarrier to consciousness. To pull\nsomeone's consciousness into a dream,\nyou must first control the dream to\nbreak through the barrier of the\nphysical body and envelop the\nconsciousness before you can pull it in.\nOrdinary people have weak physical\nbodies. So after consuming a lot of\nmental energy, he successfully broke\nthrough the physical barrier and pulled\nthe other party's consciousness into the\ndream. He then tried to pull Yong\nDongqing and Jun Wu Shang, two\nextraordinary individuals, into his\ndream, but found it impossible. Their\nphysical barriers were too strong. He\ninitially thought this ability was\nuseless. After all, why would he drag\nordinary people into his dreams just so\nthat one more real person would kneel\nbefore him, the heavenly emperor? But\nnow, after seeing Mu Chong, he\ndiscovered the usefulness of this\nability because Mu Chong has no physical\nbody. All that's there are some myithal\nalloys and electronic components.\nChapter 106. What exactly did you do to\nme, Sumu? His original plan was that if\nhe couldn't defeat Mu Chong, he would\ndirectly escape into the shadow space,\nthen use Xiao Yong Xang to jump to the\nnightmare world, find some opportunities\nto become stronger in the nightmare\nworld, and then kill Mu Chong after\nreturning. But who would have thought\nthat this kid would actually destroy his\nphysical body? They even talked about\nhow flesh and blood are weak and\nvulnerable while machines ascend to\nimmortality. This made Sumu change his\nmind instantly, and he decided to give\nMu Chong a big surprise. He exited the\ndream and his mental energy, which had\nbeen completely depleted by the silver\nvertical pupils, was instantly\nreplenished and strengthened by 1%.\nSnap! He snapped his fingers, and Xiao\nYong Xang instantly lost consciousness,\ncollapsing to the ground and falling\ninto a deep sleep. Sumu smiled with\ninterest. Things are getting more and\nmore interesting. You became a superhum\nby relying on the nightmare apostle, but\nyou look down on the nightmare apostle.\nhow interesting your expression will be\nonce you become a nightmare apostle\nyourself. This is truly something to\nlook forward to. He then reentered the\ndream and manipulated his own dream to\nconnect with Xiao Yong Xang&lt;unk&gt;s dream.\nGradually, a crimson hue appeared in\nXiao Yong Jang&lt;unk&gt;s dream. As the dream\nwas gradually swallowed up, the crimson\nhue spread like a plague to Su Mu&lt;unk&gt;s\ndream. Mu Chong was still waiting\nanxiously. As time went by, his initial\nrage subsided and he regained the\ncomposure of a silver rank expert,\nsneering inwardly. I am a fully modified\nhuman. I can wait here without eating or\ndrinking. Sumu, what do you have to\ncompare with me? Just as he was thinking\nthis, suddenly a blood red color\nappeared in his vision as if his retina\nhad been covered with a layer of blood.\nAlthough he did not have a retina, this\nblood red color was still very strange.\nMuch Chan was startled, but before he\ncould react, the crimson colors suddenly\ndisappeared. When his vision returned,\nhe was completely stunned. This This is\nHe looked around in astonishment. The\nprevious ruins had completely\ndisappeared, replaced by a lush forest\nwith the sun high in the sky and trees\ntowering into the clouds. However, the\nseemingly vibrant forest was completely\nsilent. No wind, no bird song, no\nfalling leaves, nothing at all, only\ndeathly stillness. The primeval\nforestlike scene made Mu Chong panic for\na moment, but when he saw Sumu not far\naway, his panic turned into a cold\nlaugh. Under a large tree not far away,\nsmiled in greeting, his eyes behind his\nbrown glasses containing an unfathomable\nsmile. It seems I underestimated your\nillusionary abilities. You actually\nmanaged to fool my metal prosthetic eye.\nThis kind of illusion must directly\naffect the soul, right? Much sneered.\nHowever, illusions are ultimately just\nillusions. In the face of absolute\npower, they are all a joke. Seeing\nMuengs confidence, Su felt relieved and\nsmiled, welcoming him. Mr. Mu, welcome\nto the nightmare world. A nightmare\nworld. Mu Chong was slightly startled,\nbut quickly recovered. H playing tricks.\nYou think I'm not a nightmare apostle,\nso you don't know anything about\nnightmares? Show. Sumu gently placed his\nfinger to his lips and said with a faint\nsmile, \"Whether it's playing tricks or\nnot, you only need to sense the law.\nThere are barriers in the real world,\nand even if you become a superhum, you\ncan only vaguely sense the law. But the\nnightmare world is different. As long as\nyou sense it carefully, you will find\nthat the law is clearly visible.\" Seeing\nthe seriousness with which Sumu spoke,\nMuengs heart tightened. Although he\ninstinctively disbelieved him, he still\nsubconsciously tried to sense the silver\nlaw. And a silver law spanning endless\ndimensions and surpassing the bronze law\nclearly appeared in his perception. This\nis impossible. Much roared in a horse\nvoice. Illusion. It's all an illusion.\nYou can't fool me. How could I suddenly\nappear in the nightmare world? I've\nalways been awake, and since becoming a\ncyborg, I don't need to sleep at all. I\ncouldn't possibly become a nightmare\napostle. Seeing you so happy, Mr. Moo,\nputs my mind at ease. It wasn't for\nnothing that I went to all that trouble\nto invite you into the nightmare world.\nI don't believe it. Much Chong was even\nmore terrified. As a silver level\ntranscendent, he had dealt with\nnightmare apostles many times in his\ndaily life. He knew how terrifying the\nnightmare world was. It was a curse that\nmeant certain death. Whoever got tainted\nby it would die. This is all an\nillusion. Once I kill you, the illusion\nwill be dispelled. I'll kill you. Mu\nChong was about to charge towards Su Mu\nwith the six cyborgs. But the next\nsecond he suddenly stopped and his body\nmade of myithil alloy began to tremble\nslightly. It was because he suddenly\ndiscovered that countless red dots had\nappeared in his metallic eyes, densely\npacked red dots. His metal prosthetic\neye has infrared imaging capabilities,\nallowing him to see the body temperature\nemitted by living organisms. These red\ndots represent countless living\ncreatures hidden in the forest.\nFurthermore, the red dot is constantly\nenlarging, proving that these living\ncreatures are surging towards this place\nlike a tide. Sumu's eyes flickered\nslightly as he glanced into the depths\nof the forest. Although his view was\nobscured by the lush trees, his powerful\nperception, aided by his spiritual\nenergy, allowed him to sense that\nsomething was rapidly approaching.\nSuddenly, a person rushed out of the\nforest and stood between Su Mu and Mu\nChong. Upon seeing this person,\nMuing&lt;unk&gt;s expression changed\ndrastically. This person could not be\ncalled human at all. Although he had a\nhuman form, his neck was a smooth\ncross-section with no head. The most\nbizarre thing is that the headless man's\nbody is covered with countless ears,\neach with a different shape, as if they\nwere embedded in his flesh. Some are\nsmall and delicate, while others are\nlarge and thick. The headless man with\nears stood silently between the two, as\nif frozen in place, motionless, with\nonly his ears trembling slightly, as if\nsearching for something. Sumu narrowed\nhis eyes slightly. He keenly noticed\nsomething strange. The headless man had\nclearly rushed out of the forest. But\nwhen his body broke through the flowers\nand grass, he made no sound, and there\nwas no sound of footsteps. The\nappearance of the headless man was like\nthe last straw that broke the\ncamel&lt;unk&gt;s back, causing Mu Chung to\ncollapse. He realized that this was not\nan illusion, because illusions could not\nfool the metal prosthetic eye. The red\nlight flashing in metal. Yi&lt;unk&gt;s eyes\nclearly showed that the headless man in\nfront of him was alive. Why? Much roared\nlike a madman. He could no longer\ndeceive himself. Both the clearly\nvisible laws and the headless man in\nfront of him who was a living being\nclearly told him that this was no longer\nreality but a nightmare world. Why did I\ncome to the nightmare world? Why did I\nbecome a nightmare apostle? What did you\ndo to me? Sumu. Chapter 107. The second\nnightmare. Much Chong roared furiously,\nhis voice even containing a hint of\ndespair. His breakdown wasn't due to\nfear of the monster before him. He had\nkilled some nightmare monsters in the\nreal world, and even the unrememberable\nones were ones he had personally\ncaptured. What he truly feared was the\nnightmare world, a nightmare from which\none could never escape, once tainted.\nJust then, the headless figure that had\nbeen blocking the two of them suddenly\nmoved. Its ears twitched slightly as if\nit had locked onto a target, and it\nturned around abruptly, charging\nstraight towards Mu Chong. Driven to\nmadness, Mu Chong had no intention of\ntolerating the headless man. Seeing him\ncharge, he raised his right hand without\na word, and his wrist snapped instantly,\nrevealing the silver barrel of a Gatling\ngun. Get out of my way, da da da. A huge\ngunshot rang out and the headless man,\nwho hadn't even reached them yet, was\ninstantly torn to shreds by bullets.\nAfter dealing with the headless man, he\nturned his attention to Sumu. Sumu,\nyou're the one who put me in the\nnightmare world. You must have a way\nout, right? Tell me. Sumu pushed up his\nbrown tinted glasses, a smile of\nexcitement spreading across his fair\nface. That's the expression, huh? You\nwho always look down on nightmare\napostles are so pathetic in the\nnightmare world. Brilliant. Absolutely\nbrilliant. I'm really curious. What's it\nlike to suddenly become someone you once\ndespised? I'll [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] kill you. Much\nChong roared furiously, his reason\nalmost completely consumed by rage. But\nbefore he could make a move, headless\nmen rushed out of the deep forest one\nafter another. At a rough glance, there\nwere no less than a hundred of them. And\nthere were even more headless men\npouring out from behind. Their ears\ntwitched excitedly, even turning\nslightly red as they charged towards Mu\nChong without hesitation. Get out. Get\nout of here, you monsters. The six\ncyborgs opened fire simultaneously, and\ngunfire erupted. Headless men fell one\nafter another, but strangely, their\nnumbers did not decrease. Instead, they\nincreased with each passing gunshot.\nSound. Sumu roughly figured out the\nheadless people's behavior pattern. In\nhis line of sight, some headless people\nwere greedily devouring the sounds Mu\nChong was making. There were obvious\nvortexes formed by air vibrations around\ntheir ears. As the vortex appeared, the\ngunfire, which should have been intense,\ngradually weakened. When it reached Su\nMu&lt;unk&gt;s ears, the sound of bullets was\neven less loud than the sound of\nstomping his feet. It seems these\nheadless people feed on sound, so\neverything here is silent, and any sound\nwill attract them. This pattern is not\nhard to discover. But unfortunately, Mu\nChong had already lost his mind when he\nfirst entered the nightmare world. Much\nChong fired wildly, but there were\nsimply too many headless men, and their\nvitality was exceptionally tenacious.\nWithout heads, they seemed to have no\nfatal weaknesses, and unless they were\ntorn to pieces, it would be difficult to\nkill them with just a few bullets. Soon,\nmany headless men pounced on the cyborg,\nexcitedly, pounding on its metal skin,\ncreating a huge sound. The sound was\nquickly swallowed up, and strangely,\nthose headless men who absorbed the\nsound began to grow larger. The enlarged\nheadless man became stronger, and the\nsound of him beating the cyborg became\nlouder, seemingly creating a positive\ncycle. Compared to Muengs disheveled\nstate, Sumu appeared somewhat calm and\ncollected, quietly watching the show\nfrom the sidelines. He didn't make a\nsound. So, naturally, he didn't attract\nthe Headless Man's attention.\nOriginally, he planned to directly enter\nthe shadow space and then use the\nnightmare world to weaken Muengs power.\nBut now, it seems that he doesn't need\nto. Besides, Sumu, who was not attacked,\nXiao Yong Xiang, who entered with him,\nwas also not attacked. This was because\nXiao Yong Xiang was still under hypnosis\nand stood still without moving unless Su\nMu gave an order. Mu Chong is very\nstrong. No matter how many headless men\nthere are, it will be difficult for them\nto break through his mythal alloy.\nHowever, as the sound of the headless\nmen devouring increases, the outcome may\nchange. Seeing Mu Chung being besieged,\nSumu felt a little bored. So, he quietly\nwalked into the depths of the forest.\nSumu, don't even think about running\naway. Mu Chong suddenly roared, and the\nsix modified humans went all out,\ncharging towards Sumu, regardless of the\nheadless people hanging on their bodies.\nHe raised the barrel of his gun,\nintending to fire to stop Sumu, but\ninstead heard a series of empty gunshots\ncoming from his arm. He was out of\nbullets. Enraged, he could only chase\nafter them on foot. Five of the cyborgs\nworked together to stop the headless\narmy while the remaining cyborg broke\nthrough the encirclement. Ultimately, he\nwas a silver level expert. Even though\nhe used a modified human body, the speed\nhe unleashed was unmatched by Sumu. The\ndistance between the two shortened\nrapidly, but at that moment, Sumu\nsuddenly stopped, standing motionless\nlike a wooden statue, even holding his\nbreath. Although Mu Chong had doubts, he\nwas too enraged to care and continued\nrunning. The myithal alloy on his body\nmaking heavy clanging noises. Suddenly,\neverything went black before his eyes,\nand he was covered by a huge shadow.\nWhen he looked up, he was shocked to\nfind a headless man more than 10 m tall\nexcitedly listening to him. A giant hand\ncovered in ears descended from the sky\nand viciously grabbed at Mu Chong. Mu\nChong was shocked and rolled away to\navoid the attack. However, the sound of\nhis roll was too loud because he was\nmade of metal. The headless man, who was\n10 m tall, almost stopped and grabbed at\nhim again. He scrambled and tumbled\nfrantically to dodge. Although Myithil\nalloy is hard and difficult to break, it\ncan still deform under tremendous force.\nThe more he hid, the bigger the\ncommotion became. Before long, many\nsmaller headless figures appeared in the\nforest and surrounded him. Mu Chung was\nextremely anxious. What on earth was\ngoing on? Out of the corner of his eye,\nhe caught sight of Sumu, who was\nunharmed beside him. Sumu even waved to\nhim in a friendly manner, signaling his\nencouragement. Son of a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Why is\nthat bastard all okay? Wait, I must have\noverlooked something. Think carefully.\nHow did those lowly nightmare apostles\nsurvive one nightmare after another?\nThese headless people have no heads, but\ntheir bodies are covered with ears.\nEars. I understand now. It's a sound. As\nlong as I don't make a sound, I won't\nattract the monsters attacks. Thinking\nthis, Muing suddenly stopped. However,\nthings didn't go as planned. The\nheadless men who were chasing him had\nalready heard the sound. Stopping was\ntantamount to walking into a trap. The\nheadless figures running wildly crashed\ninto the metal shell, making loud noises\nas they excitedly pounded on it,\ncontinuously creating more sounds. Much\nwas furious when he saw this. You damn\nmonsters, get out of here. He wasn't\nafraid of these smaller headless men,\nbut the 10- m tall headless man had also\ncome over following the sound. Chapter\n108. Idiot. Don't you dare move. A large\nhand descended from the sky and grabbed\nMu Chong in one swift motion, crushing\nseveral smaller headless men to death on\nthe spot. Mu Chong breathed a sigh of\nrelief. At least the headless man wasn't\nrandomly hitting him. As long as he\ndidn't make a sound, he should be fine.\nThe fact that he thought that way\nclearly showed that he regarded the\nheadless man as an idiot. The next\nsecond, the 10- m tall headless man\nsuddenly grabbed Mu Chengs leg with two\nthick fingers and began to smash it\nwildly against the surrounding trees.\nBang! Bang! Bang! Several large trees\nwere knocked down by Mu Chong, making a\nloud noise. The 10- m tall headless man\ngot excited and started to swing wildly\nuntil all the surrounding trees were\nknocked down. It was still not satisfied\nand started to smash the cards on the\nground. It looked just like a child\nthrowing cards, using all its strength\nto throw them, then picking them up and\nthrowing them again, enjoying it\nimmensely. Boom! Much was once again\nslammed into a deep pit. The ground\nbeneath him was already cracked, and his\nindestructible mythal body was severely\ndeformed. Even the connection between\nhis legs and body had come loose,\nrevealing a dense network of wires.\n\"You, you damn monsters! I've [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\nhad enough.\" A roar filled with rage\nfinally erupted. He could no longer hold\nback. He felt targeted. Even though he\nhad stopped making a sound, why wouldn't\nthey leave him alone? Damn it. You all\ndeserve to die. Sumu deserves to die,\ntoo. You all deserve to die. Much\ncrawled out of the deep pit, his eyes\nflashing red light wildly. You [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\nlike sounds, don't you? This time, I'll\nlet you hear enough. Initiate\nself-destruct program. Upon hearing\nthis, Sumu, who was taking a walk in the\ndistance, immediately quickened his\npace, not caring that the sound of his\nfootsteps might attract some headless\npeople. Boom! Mu Chong self-destructed,\nand the huge explosion almost echoed\nthroughout the entire forest. The first\nto be hit was the 10-me tall headless\ngiant. In a blinding white light, the\ngiant turned into a shower of flying\nflesh and blood scattering across the\nsky and earth. Some of the smaller\nheadless people nearby were also blown\nto pieces. The area within a radius of\n100 m was almost completely leveled and\neven Sumu located a kilometer away was\nsignificantly impacted. The enormous\nsound immediately attracted all the\nheadless men present who dropped\neverything and rushed frantically toward\nthe center of the explosion. Sumu tidied\nhis hair which had been messed up by the\nshock of the explosion and smiled\nsilently. One swish swish swish. Five\nmyithil alloy cyborgs gleaming with\nsilver light rushed towards them at an\nincredible speed. Sumu slightly raised\nhis eyes to check the distance between\nhimself and the cyborg. He remained calm\nand even straightened his suit which had\nbeen wrinkled from running. Then under\nMuengs watchful gaze, he accepted\nBubai's invitation and disappeared into\nthe shadow space. Hu Chong was so angry\nhe wanted to roar at the sky. But he\ndidn't dare. He had finally managed to\nlure away all the headless men with the\nself-destruction of a cyborg. And now\nshouting would be pointless. Frustrated\nand exasperated, he could only repeat\nhis previous actions, waiting at the\nentrance to the shadow space. However,\nunlike last time, this time he dared not\nmove at all for fear of making the\nslightest sound. Gradually, the group of\nheadless people dispersed from the\ncenter of the explosion. They began to\nwander around searching for the sound.\nSome even walked up to Mu Chong, making\nMu Ching&lt;unk&gt;s heart pound with fear.\nFortunately, this time there were no\naccidents. The headless man walked past\nhim and headed away into the distance.\nTatata. A soft sound of footsteps\nsuddenly came from behind Muchong. Much\nwas taken aback. What was that footstep\nsound? He slowly turned around to look,\nnot daring to speed up, afraid that the\nsound of his neck turning would be too\nloud since his neck was made of metal.\nWhen he saw the source of the footsteps,\nhe was stunned. The footsteps came from\nnone other than the bald man, Xiao Yong\nJang. It turned out that Ziao Yong Jang\nhad somehow gotten there while the\nheadless man was at the center of the\nexplosion. Upon seeing this, Muchong\nbecame extremely anxious, his eyes\nflashing red as he signaled Xiao Yong\nnot to move. However, Ziao Yong Jang\nseemed not to see this and continued to\napproach. Several headless figures\nwandering not far away suddenly stopped,\ntheir countless ears twitching slightly\nas if they were listening. You [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\nidiot. Don't you dare move. Much Chong\nroared inwardly. And perhaps his curses\nhad an effect because Xiao Yong Jang\nreally stopped moving and stopped about\n3 meters away from Mu Chong. Call. Mu\nChong breathed a sigh of relief.\nThankfully, he wasn't too foolish. He\nwas unaware of the relationship between\nXiao Yong Xiang and Su, assuming that\nthe other party was also a newly arrived\nnightmare apostle. If he had known, he\nwould never have felt relieved. Because\nh without warning, Xiao Yong Xan opened\nhis mouth wide and howled wildly, the\nsound so loud it was as if someone had\nbroken his leg. Mu Chong was startled by\nthe shout, \"You son of a bitch.\" \"For\nthe leader!\" Xiao Yong Chang rushed\ntoward Mu Chong with a fanatical\nexpression, shouting repeatedly. \"What\ndoes it feel like when someone suddenly\nshouts with all their might in a deathly\nsilent forest? It feels like a\nthunderclap from a clear sky.\"\nInstantly, the headless figures\nwandering aimlessly all around seemed to\nhave received a signal. Their ears stood\nup and they rushed towards this place\nwithout regard for anything else. You\ndeserve to die. Much was furious. He\nthrew out his silver glowing metal fist,\nsmashing Xiao Yong Xan&lt;unk&gt;s head apart\nwith a single punch, and his voice came\nto an abrupt end. Seeing that Xiao Yong\nXian&lt;unk&gt;s body was about to lie flat on\nthe ground, he was so frightened that he\nquickly grabbed him. But it was too\nlate. His shout had already attracted\nthe headless men. \"Damn it,\" he cursed\nunder his breath, then directly control\nthe cyborg to run away into the\ndistance, deliberately making a loud\nnoise. Upon hearing the sound, the\nheadless people immediately changed\ndirection and chased after the cyborgs.\nBefore the crisis was over, an arm\nsilently emerged from the shadowy\nhumanoid figure on the ground, then\nelegantly picked up a small pebble and\ntossed it at one of the cyborgs. The\npower carried by the Mega Force fist\nexploded instantly, and the small stones\nmade a sharp popping sound as they hit\nthe cyborg's body hard. When a crisp,\nloud collision sound rang out. When Mu\nChung turned around, he was stunned and\nonly saw that arm wave its hand before\nreturning to the shadow space. Sumu,\nI'll [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] kill you. A person's mental\nstate can collapse in an instant.\nSometimes because of something of great\nimportance, and sometimes because of\nsomething as trivial as throwing a\npebble. You want to use these monsters\nagainst me, huh? Well, then I'll kill\nthem all first and see what you can do\nthen. Having been repeatedly tricked, Mu\nChong had completely broken down. Unable\nto hit Sumu, he could only vent all his\nanger on the headless man. In his view,\nthese little headless men were not\ndangerous, at most a bit troublesome,\nbut they could be dealt with with a\nlittle effort. A major battle has begun.\nAll because Su Mu dropped the small\npebble. Chapter 109. The Headless Man's\nLair. Enraged, Mu Chong displayed the\nfull strength of a silver rank expert,\nand the five cyborgs cooperated\nseamlessly, slaughtering the headless\nmen around them with extremely high\nefficiency. Come on, you monsters like\nme, don't you? Come on over here, he\ncursed as he killed, as if venting his\nanger. Sumu, just wait. After I kill\nthem, I'll come and kill you. No, I\nwon't kill you. I'll imprison you and\ntorture you slowly. You destroyed\neverything I had. I'll let you know what\ndespair is. I, a silver transcendent,\nhad a bright future ahead of me and a\nperfect myithal alloy body. I had long\nsince surpassed the limits of human\nlifespan. But you ruined all of that.\nRuined it. This damned nightmare world\ncould take my life at any moment. I'm\nliving one day less each day, but until\nthen, I'll torment you until the day I\ndie. Then we'll die together so I can\ncontinue tormenting you in hell. Huh? Mu\nChong laughed wildly, his cold\nmechanical body unable to contain his\noverflowing madness. A hysterical\noutburst born of desperation. Although\nhe was not a nightmare apostle, he\nunderstood nightmare apostles better\nthan they did. They were cursed beings\ndestined to die young, no matter how\nmuch they struggled, even if they became\ngold ranked warriors. Mu Chong laughed\nwildly as the corpses piled up at his\nfeet, almost burying him. He continued\nto kill, venting his anger in this way.\nBut gradually, a shadow covered him.\nThen a second, a third, and a tenth.\nMuing&lt;unk&gt;s body stiffened, and he\nraised his head with some difficulty.\nThe red light in the metal eyes almost\nwent out. In his vision, the entire sky\nwas plunged into darkness, and 10\nheadless giants were arranged in a\ncircle, listening to him. Inside the\nshadow space, Sumu looked through the\nshadows at Mu Chong, who was being\nkicked around by 10 giants and felt a\nlittle sorry for him. How could a\ndignified silver realm expert have\nfallen to such a state? Simple. You\ncan't even do something as easy as just\nnot making a sound. Boom. Boom. Boom.\nThree cyborgs self-destructed, and the\nterrifying explosion killed 10 headless\ngiants. Taking advantage of this gap,\nSumu emerged from the shadow space and\nswiftly ran away into the distance. At\nthis point, Muing only had two cyborgs\nleft. In his anger, he began to feel\nfear because it meant he only had two\nlives left. Fear brought him back to his\nsenses. He realized he had been too\nimpulsive. Those short-lived nightmare\napostles had said that fighting monsters\nhead-on in a nightmare was the worst\nthing to do. The best strategy was to\nfind the source of the dream and then\nbreak the nightmare. He was extremely\nannoyed. If he had followed the advice\nof those nightmare apostles earlier, he\nmight not have ended up in this\npredicament. This dream wasn't actually\ndifficult. As long as I didn't make a\nsound, I wouldn't be attacked. I just\nneeded to slowly search for clues. But\nnow it's too late to say anything.\nWatching Sumu run further and further\naway, Mu Chong gritted his teeth and\nfollowed. He already had a plan in mind.\nThis time, he dared not act recklessly\nagain, but planned to try a different\napproach. The distance between the two\nbegan to close. And then Sumu started\nthrowing stones again. Upon seeing the\nflying stones, Mu Chong was both shocked\nand furious, dodging them as if they\nwere deadly bullets, not daring to let\nthem hit him. What's most infuriating is\nthat he can't throw stones because Sumu\nis made of flesh and blood, and the\nstones don't make much of a sound when\nthey hit him. Most importantly, Sumu can\ndodge flexibly and make large movements\nwhile he cannot because he has a metal\nbody which is very heavy. And the larger\nthe movement, the louder the sound. He\nnever imagined that one day his proud\nmythal alloy body would have such great\ninconvenience. As he ran, Sumu suddenly\nstopped. Seeing this, Mu Chong froze in\nplace, not daring to move an inch. He\nquickly looked into the depths of the\nforest directly in front of him, turned\nthe infrared function of his metal\nprosthetic eye to the maximum, and then\nhe froze. Red dots. Thousands upon\nthousands of red dots appeared before my\neyes. This is the layer of the headless\nmen. At this moment, Sumu suddenly\nturned around and waved to Mu Chong.\nAlthough he didn't say anything, the\nmeaning was very clear. Come here. Much\nwas furious. He knew that as soon as he\nwent over, Sumu would make a sound and\nthen disappear into the shadows, at\nwhich point he would be attacked by\nthousands of headless men. But in order\nto get revenge, he went anyway. A cyborg\nwas sent to stealthily pursue Sumu. And\na comical scene unfolded. A tall cyborg\ncovered in metal hopped on tiptoe and\ntrotted around crouching low. Mu Chong\nhad no choice. Once he reached the\nvicinity of the headless man's lair, he\ndared not make a sound. Sumu paid no\nattention to Mu Chong sneaking behind\nhim and ran lightly toward the headless\nman's lair. His powerful mental strength\ngave him unparalleled perception,\nallowing him to accurately judge the\npath under his feet. There would be no\nridiculous scene like in the movies\nwhere he suddenly broke a dead tree\nbranch and attracted the enemy's\nattention. After he crossed a large\ntree, the headless man's lair came into\nview. It was a city. It was a very\nsimple city with all the buildings made\nof bare stone blocks that showed signs\nof weathering and had obviously existed\nfor a long time. The buildings in the\ncity were more like caves than houses\nwithout doors and entirely made of huge\npiles of stones where countless headless\npeople lived. Some were sleeping while\nothers were eating. Their eating method\nwas very simple. They picked up a stone\nand pounded it to make noise. But these\nsounds could not be transmitted and were\nall swallowed by the headless man. The\nappearance of Sumu did not attract their\nattention because the headless man had\nno eyes and relied entirely on the ears\nthat covered his entire body to perceive\nthings. They continued doing their own\nthing. After a brief look around, Sumu\nrealized that the city was on the edge\nof a nightmare with a black fog that\nblotted out the sky and surged silently\nbehind it. Without hesitation, he\nentered the humble little town and\nbecause of the low buildings, he quickly\ndiscovered a place that was quite\ndifferent from others. In the center of\nthe city is a huge square, somewhat like\na concert venue. The square is\nsurrounded by a semi-ircular stone wall.\nThe stone wall is very thick, and there\nare deep pits dug out on it, resembling\nseats, where many headless people lie\nquietly. In the square, there was a\nhuge, irregularly shaped boulder with\ndozens of headless giants, each 10 m\ntall, prostrating themselves on the\nground as if in worship. Just as Sumu\nthought they were kneeling before the\nboulder, a person sat up straight on the\nboulder. His body shape was no different\nfrom that of a normal adult man, but his\nbody was covered with ears. His skin was\npale, and most importantly, his neck was\nnot empty. Instead, it grew a huge ear.\nChapter 110. This is the thrill I've\nbeen searching for. It looked extremely\nbizarre, where a person should have a\nhead. There was a huge ear, almost the\nsize of a head. The leader? Sumu's eyes\nflickered slightly as he silently\napproached the headless leader. He\nnimblely stepped over the sleeping\nheadless men on the ground. His speed\nshowing no sign of slowing down like a\ndancer treading on a knife's edge where\none wrong step would lead to utter\ndestruction. But his powerful mental\nstrength and enhanced physical abilities\nmade his steps as precise as a scalpel\nwithout a single mistake. Mu Chong, who\nwas still a 100 meters away from Sumu,\nhad a red light flashing in his eyes. He\ndid not back down and followed closely\nbehind. At this moment, the headless\nleader seemed to hear a slight noise and\nactually stood up. His large ears on his\nneck scanned like radar, and invisible\nsound waves created tiny vortexes in\nfront of his ears. They quickly located\nSumu and Mu Chong. Upon seeing this, the\ntwo stood motionless as if playing a\ngame of red light, green light. The\nheadless leader waited for a while, but\nheard nothing unusual, so he turned\naround and began to explore in other\ndirections with his large ear. Sumu\nrealized he couldn't go any further. The\nheadless leader's hearing was clearly\nbetter than that of ordinary headless\nmen, and he couldn't miss even the\nslightest sounds. But Mu Chong seemed to\nhave lost his mind and continued to\nadvance, attracting the gaze of the\nheadless leaders several times. However,\nwhenever he is watched, he immediately\nstops and stands still. He took such a\nrisk just to get a little closer to\nSumu. Finally, when he was about 10 m\naway from Sumu, he stopped. Sumu looked\nhim over with interest, knowing that Mu\nChong must have some means to use,\notherwise he wouldn't have sent a cyborg\nto his death for nothing. Sure enough,\nthe next moment, Mu Chong revealed a\nsinister smile. He slowly raised his\nleft arm, and the tip of a metal finger\nsplit open to reveal a thin black tube\ninside. \"Z purple poisonous gas shot out\nin a line, covering Sumu.\" Sumu raised\nan eyebrow. After waiting for so long,\nthis is all poison gas. He was still\nhoping Mu Chong would pull some\nsurprises, but now he couldn't help but\nfeel a little disappointed. Soon, purple\npoisonous gas enveloped Sumu, but he\ndidn't dodge, letting the gas enter his\nbody. Mu Chong was overjoyed upon seeing\nthis. This was a speciallymade poison\ngas. Inhaling even a single breath could\nbe fatal, and even without inhalation,\nit would still cause poisoning if it\ncame into contact with the skin. In his\neyes, Sumu was already a dead man.\nHowever, as time went by, Mu&lt;unk&gt;s\necstatic mood gradually cooled down. He\nsaw that Su Mu was still standing there\nunharmed and even yawned out of boredom.\nThat's impossible. Sizzle. The poison\ngas was almost gone. A few wisps of\npurple smoke, like endless urination,\nwere exhaled intermittently before it\nwas completely used up. The poison gas\nis good, but unfortunately, it's\ncountered by innocent heart. Sumu lost\nhis patience. His shadow moved without\nwind, and the black shadow, Bubai,\nquickly emerged from the shadow,\nstretching out its only remaining arm.\nSumu grasped Bubai&lt;unk&gt;s large hand. And\nthen, Mr. Mu, since you have no\nsurprises for me, then I can only ask\nyou to die. His voice was soft, even\ngentle, but in the deathly silent city\nwhere you could hear a pin drop, this\ngentle voice was like a bolt from the\nblue, instantly shattering the silence.\nThe next moment in the square and in the\ndeep pit in the stone wall, circle after\ncircle of headless people stood up in\nunison, staring straight at Su Mu&lt;unk&gt;s\ndirection. Haha. In such a tense moment,\nMu Chong laughed wildly. Sumu, do you\nreally think I can't do anything to you?\nDo you think you're the only one with a\ntrump card? Countless headless figures\nsurged toward the two like a tidal wave,\ntheir terrifying presence seemingly\nthreatening to engulf them. But Much\nChong was still laughing. You destroyed\neverything I had. Even if it costs me\nthis cyborg body, I will kill you.\nAren't you relying on that monster? Now,\nlet's see if that monster can still save\nyou. Sumu's eyes flickered slightly, and\nhe immediately noticed something was\nwrong. Bubai, who was supposed to pull\nhim into the shadow space, was now\nfrozen in place as if someone had cast a\nspell on him. Is this the power of the\nmaster of servants? Har, you guessed\nright. This is Silver Law sequence 24.\nMinion Master, you destroyed my cyborg,\nbut that just made room for a servant,\ngiving me enough mental power to control\nit. Although I can't directly control\nyour shadow monster without refining it,\nI can forcibly influence it. You're\ndead, Sumu. Muing&lt;unk&gt;s expression grew\nincreasingly ferocious, and even his\nmetallic face couldn't conceal that\nferocity. Su Mu Jing&lt;unk&gt;s blue eyes\nshone with a unique light. He released\nBuba&lt;unk&gt;s hand and couldn't help but\napplaud Mu Chong, praising as expected\nof a silver realm expert. What a fine\nsilver realm expert. Only matches where\na comeback is possible at any moment can\nbe considered exciting. Mr. Mu, you have\nnot disappointed me after all. I don't\nneed your praise. Go to hell, Sumu. Mu\nChong hated being praised. It made him\nfeel like a primary school student being\npraised by a teacher. He darted out and\nrushed towards Sumu, by which time the\nheadless man had completely surrounded\nthe two of them. A horrifying scene\nunfolded as Mu Chong, his body gleaming\nwith metallic light, leaped high into\nthe air and charged forward like a human\ntank, surrounded by a tidal wave of\nheadless monsters. At this moment, Sumu\nwas truly in a situation where there was\nno way out but to heaven and no way out\nbut to earth. and he was in a hopeless\nsituation. But he kept laughing, his\nsmile widening and even starting to\ndistort, his expression carrying a hint\nof extreme manic excitement. This is the\nthrill I've been searching for. He\nflipped his hand and a bottle of pale\nred potion suddenly appeared in his\nhand. He raised the red potion in his\nhand, but before he could even open the\ncap to drink it, there was a cracking\nsound as the transparent glass bottle\nwas crushed. Sumu tilted his head back\nand the pale red liquid mixed with glass\nshards fell into his mouth. \"Grle,\" he\nswallowed hard, completely, ignoring the\nstinging pain in his throat from the\nglass shards. His expression grew\nincreasingly excited, and a hint of\nblood appeared in his eyes. Even his\nfair skin had a faint blush, making him\nlook like he had drunk too much. This is\nthe effect of the Berserk potion, which\nforcibly unleashes terrifying potential\nat the cost of overdrawing the body's\nreserves. Chapter 11. looking forward to\nthe next meeting. In an instant, Sumu\nfelt a surge of violent power coursing\nthrough his body. His muscles bulged\ninvoluntarily, and he suddenly exerted\nhis strength, his legs like springs,\ncracking the ground as he stomped on\nthem. He soared into the air, charging\ntowards Mu Chong without dodging or\navoiding him. The two figures, both\nexuding an indomitable spirit, met in\nmidair. Below them, a pile of headless\nmen scrambling to climb. Mu Chong\nsneered inwardly. He thought Sumu had\ngone mad, actually thinking of fighting\nhim, a silver level expert, in this\ndesperate situation. Well, so be it. He\ncould kill him with his own hands. The\ngleaming silver metal arm was operating\nat full power, its inner walls sly\nheating up and emitting a crimson glow,\ncausing the surrounding air to distort\ndue to the intense heat. Sumu was\nequally unwilling to be outdone, pushing\nhis Megap Force fist to its limit. The\nmuscles of his entire right arm swelled,\nunleashing a terrifying burst of power.\nDie! Boom! Amid Mu Changengs ferocious\nroar, the metal fist collided violently\nwith the human fist. The moment they\nmade contact, he sensed something was\nwrong because Sumu's fist had absolutely\nno power. However, he didn't think too\nmuch about it. Anyway, Sumu would\ndefinitely die if he took this punch\nhead on. This was the confidence of a\nsilver level expert. Bang! Sumu's figure\nflew backward like a cannonball. Mu\nChong, who had avenged his great enemy,\nlaughed wildly and let the headless men\naround him attack him. He didn't care.\nHe only wanted to kill Sumu. But the\nnext second, Muengs smile froze because\nin his sight, Sumu, who was flying\nbackward, turned around in midair as if\nnothing had happened. Then stepped on\nthe neck of a headless man and quickly\nfled into the distance, jumping onto the\nhigh walls around the square in the\nblink of an eye. This is impossible. Mu\nChong, who was overwhelmed by the\nheadless men, hurriedly shut down the\nself-destruct program and chased after\nSu Mu like a madman. His cold metal arm\nswung wildly, and each swing was\naccompanied by many headless men being\nswept away. A noble fantasm. It's a\ndefensive noble fantasm. He realized the\nkey point and understood everything in\nan instant. This was all Sumu's scheme.\nHe pretended to fight desperately, but\ndidn't actually use any strength,\nletting Sumu knock him away. All in\norder to escape the encirclement\nsmoothly. No wonder Sumu dared to fight\nhead-on. He had a defensive treasure. On\nthe high wall, a tall figure stood, his\nsnake patterned wooden cane resting on\nthe edge of the wall. He smiled as he\nwatched Mu Chong being swallowed up by\nthe headless men. The sunlight shone on\nhim, casting a long shadow on the\nground. A gentle breeze blew up his\nclothes and the crimson heart hanging on\nhis chest. Beneath the high wall,\ncountless headless figures scrambled to\nclimb, stepping on each other's bodies\nas they ascended little by little. Sumu\nMu Chong roared in a horse voice from\nthe pile of people. He struggled to\nstretch out his hands from the pile of\nheadless people, trying to take the\nopportunity to climb out, but there were\njust too many headless people, and he\nwas quickly buried again. You can't\nescape. This is a dead end. After they\nkill me, they'll come after you. Sumu,\nstanding at top the high wall, smiled\nslightly, ignoring Mu Changeng&lt;unk&gt;s\nthreat. His expression was elegant and\ncomposed. He gently pushed up his brown\ntinted glasses and said, \"Thank you for\neverything you've done, Mr. Moo. I am\nvery pleased and look forward to our\nnext meeting.\" After saying that, Sumu\nwaved his hand as if saying goodbye to a\nfriend and then turned to look at the\nblack mist behind the high wall. The\nblack mist was impenetrable, as if\nleading to hell. Deathly silent. You\nwant to go into the black fog, huh?\nYou'll die anyway. No one ever comes\nback alive from the black fog. No one.\nSu Mua didn't reply, saying, \"No need\nfor Mr. Moo to trouble himself.\" Just as\nI was able to pull you into the\nnightmare world, I also already have a\nway to escape from the black mist. So,\ngoodbye. What? You have a way? That's\nimpossible. You must be the one. Mu\nChing&lt;unk&gt;s words came to an abrupt\nhalt, for Sumu had already leaped into\nthe black mist and disappeared without a\ntrace. Within the endless black mist,\nSumu looked around in surprise. He was\nnot surprised by the black mist, but by\nthe nightmare he had escaped. The black\nfog wasn't very interesting. It felt\nlike being in a bottomless deep sea\nsurrounded by ethereal black mist with\nextremely low visibility. What was\nreally interesting was the nightmare I\njust experienced. It was a huge white\nglowing bubble that vaguely reflected\nthe scenes from the nightmare. A barren\nheadless city with the faint glow of\nexplosions and countless headless people\nbeing blown away. However, because it\nwas viewed through the bubble, the image\nwas extremely distorted and blurry.\nCould it be that all nightmares are\ncontained within these bubbles? Sumu\nexclaimed in amazement. He had never\nimagined that nightmares could be\ncontained within bubbles when viewed\nfrom the outside. This nightmare bubble\nwas enormous, and its light slightly\nilluminated the surrounding black mist,\nallowing Sumu to barely see the scenery\naround him. He turned his gaze to the\nsoles of his feet. And with the light\nfrom the bubbles, he could see clearly\nwhat was beneath him. What was beneath\nour feet was not earth at all, but a\nlayer of brown rock, bare and devoid of\nany vegetation, with only some pebbles.\nHe raised his head again and looked at\nthe top of the bubble. With the help of\nthe light emitted by the bubble, he\ncould see the sky in the black mist.\nThere was no sky at all. Above the top\nof the bubble was a layer of brown rock.\nBeneath his feet were layers of rock and\nabove him were layers of rock. Sumu even\nfelt as if he were inside a hollowedout\nmountain. Only this place was filled\nwith endless black mist. Gradually, he\ngained a clear understanding of the\nstructure of the entire nightmare world.\nFirst of all, there was no sky here. The\nplace that originally belonged to the\nsky was covered by layers of rock, and\nthere were also layers of rock under his\nfeet. The space between the two layers\nof rock was filled with black mist. The\nso-called nightmare was the bubble in\nthe hollow space in the middle. Each\nbubble represented a nightmare. Amazing.\nSumu found this kind of unknown\nexploration very interesting. If he\ndidn't personally walk into the black\nmist to see for himself, who would have\nthought that the nightmare world would\nhave such a structure? Just then, a\nstrange scene unfolded. The surrounding\nblack mist surged and churned, quickly,\ncovering and obscuring the bubble. The\nlight around it grew weaker and weaker\nuntil it finally disappeared completely.\nAt the same time, the headless nightmare\nbubble also disappeared. Sumu tried to\nfind it, but when he got to the spot\nwhere the bubble had been, he couldn't\nfind it at all, as if it had teleported\naway. He guessed that the space within\nthe black mist was likely distorted, and\nwith the disappearance of the bubbles,\nit meant he could never go back. He lied\nwhen he said he had a way to get back\nfrom the black fog so that Mu Chong\nwould die with regrets. However, whether\nor not we can go back is not important.\nWhat matters is whether the black fog is\ninteresting. Chapter 112. The world in\nthe black mist. A step forward. Walking\ndeeper into the black mist. With the\ndisappearance of the glowing bubbles,\nthe surroundings had been completely\nplunged into darkness. A deathly\nsilence. Walking through it, you can\nonly feel wisps of mist brushing against\nyour face like gentle little hands. His\neyes shone with a crystal blue light,\nand his powerful mental strength\nenhanced his perception, allowing him to\nvaguely see scenes several meters away.\nThe ground was uneven, with some places\neven rising up like small hills, but\nthere were no living creatures. Does\nthis mean that all the nightmare\napostles who enter the black mist\neventually starve to death there? Sumu\nfrowned. This was not the surprise he\nwanted. If the black mist was like a\nprison, then exploring this place would\nbe meaningless. He continued onward,\nwalking for a very long time. Judging by\nhis pocket watch, 3 hours had passed.\nBut even so, he still did not see any\nliving creatures or any other glowing\nbubbles. This doesn't make sense. If all\nthe nightmares are glowing bubbles\nscattered in the black mist, then why\nhaven't we seen any other bubbles yet?\nIt's important to understand that these\n3 hours weren't taken at the pace of an\nordinary person, but by someone with\nextraordinary abilities. At Sumu's\ncurrent speed, 3 hours would be enough\nfor him to walk out of a small county\ntown. This place is either like some\nkind of maze where you'll get lost once\nyou enter, or the world of black mist is\njust too vast. Perhaps this isn't a\nmountain that's been hollowed out, but\nrather underground. A glint of light\nflashed in Sumu's eyes. Only underground\ncould there be such a huge area. If\nthere is underground, then there must be\nabove ground. Where on the ground could\nthat be? Where else could it be? Could\nit be that the so-called nightmare world\nis actually an underground world located\nbeneath the real world where nightmares\nare put into bubbles and stored\nunderground? This discovery is\nrevolutionary regarding the origin of\nthe nightmare world. Previously, all\nnightmare apostles believe that the\nnightmare world was an alternate\ndimension, an independent world composed\nentirely of nightmares. But now, it\nseems that everything was wrong. The\nnightmare world is very likely one with\nthe real world. And it is located\nunderground. Just as Sumu was pondering,\nsuddenly, buzz. A strange buzzing sound\nemanated from all around, interspersed\nwith what seemed to be some kind of\nwhispering, the tone odd and chaotic, a\nsound that no human could possibly make.\nThe voice was like the murmur of an evil\ngod, deep and chaotic, seemingly close\nto the ear. Yet also as if it came from\na distant time and space. Sometimes it\nrolls like muffled thunder, shaking the\ndepths of the soul. Sometimes it\nwhispers like a ghost, sending chills\ndown your spine. Every syllable seems to\nchallenge reason. Sumu's head began to\nache, and he felt a surge of mad and\nviolent emotions rising within him. The\nberserk potion he had just ingested had\nnot made him go berserk. But now, after\nonly hearing some delirious ramblings,\nhis mind was in turmoil. A pure heart, a\nsoft white light rose from his body, and\nsuddenly the whispers in his ears became\nmuch quieter. Although they didn't\ndisappear completely, they were within a\ntolerable range. Definitely run away\nimmediately after hearing these\ndelirious murmurss. But Sumu is not a\nnormal person. He is very curious about\nthe sounds that can cause him mental\ndisorder. Since he is already here, how\ncan he not go and see? So he headed\ntoward the source of the murmurss, and\ngradually the eerie sound grew louder\nand louder. His immaculate heart could\nbarely hold on. Finally, he saw the\nlight not far away in the sky, or rather\non the upper rocks, suspended a huge\nsphere emitting a yellow light as bright\nas the sun. However, the sunlight\nemitted by this sun was not warm at all.\nOn the contrary, it was unusually cold.\nthe sun. There's a sun underground, too.\nSumu quickened his pace and ran towards\nthe huge glowing sphere. As he got\ncloser, the evil murmurss were almost\ndeafening, and blood was faintly flowing\nfrom his ears. When he looked up, a\nflash of yellow light appeared, and his\neyes were instantly stung with pain. A\nline of bloody tears flowed out as he\nwent blind. But the only image I had\nbefore I went blind lingered in my mind.\nThat's not the sun. It's an eyeball. an\nenormous eyeball embedded in the upper\nrock with a dark yellow vertical pupil\nthat was as cold as a cold-blooded\nanimal. Danger, danger, danger. Once\nSumu's brain stored the image of the\neyeball, his body instinctively issued\nthe highest level of alarm like the most\nprimal fear etched deep into human\ngenes. However, when the body's signals\nreached his consciousness, they were\nautomatically replaced by excitement.\nExcitement. Excitement. He had never\nencountered such a being before. A\nsingle glance evoked a fear etched deep\nwithin his genes, as if humans were born\nto fear such a being. That's wonderful.\nSuddenly, the blind Sumu felt a bone\nchilling cold, as if he were being\nwashed by some indescribable being. And\nhis whole body felt a dull, stinging\npain. At the same time, his mind began\nto be corrupted, and terrifying delirium\nseemed to come alive like millions of\ntadpoles frantically burrowing into his\nbody. The immaculate heart was instantly\npushed to its limit with a massive\namount of spiritual power poured into\nit. Under this frantic stimulation and\nexternal pressure, the immaculate heart\nseemed to undergo a qualitative change\nand its purification ability rose to\nanother level. Sumu knew that this meant\nthe immaculate heart had been completely\ndigested, but it was all in vain. The\nbronze laws were utterly ineffective\nagainst this high latitude pollution.\nThe rest was up to Sue Mood to bear. As\nthe pollution invaded, his consciousness\nwas affected, becoming extremely violent\nand chaotic. His mind was filled with\nall sorts of dark thoughts. He wanted to\nkill people, to annihilate all living\nthings, to destroy everything he could\nsee, and even had a tendency to destroy\nthe world. But just a moment later, an\neven stronger feeling welled up inside\nme. How boring. Destroying the world\narose. It stirred up feelings of\nboredom. In his dream, he was truly\ntired of destroying worlds. When he was\nextremely empty and bored, his mood\nbecame extremely violent and then he\nstarted destroying worlds. These were\nall things he had done before. Just as\nan innocent child is easily corrupted by\ndarkness. How can someone who is used to\nit or even tired of it be corrupted? To\ndye someone who has destroyed the world\ncountless times and vented all their\ndarkness in their dreams black, you\nwould need to come up with a dye that is\nblacker than black. The so-called\npollution is nothing more than\namplifying the dark side of human\nnature. Sumu doesn't need anyone's help\nwith this. In his omnipotent dream\nworld, and without any supervision, his\ndarkness is unimaginable to anyone.\nChapter 113. The gaze of the gods. And\nso, miraculously, he did not lose\nconsciousness. Even though his mind was\nfilled with countless negative emotions\nand thoughts. However, although his\nconsciousness did not collapse, his body\ncould not withstand it. Under the gaze\nof this being, the cells in his body\nshowed a faint tendency to undergo\ngenetic collapse. He tried to summon\nBubai and enter the shadow space. But\nBubai s response was very weak, as if he\nwas about to die. His shadow rippled\nlike water before falling silent again.\nThis time, Bubai's contact was\ncompletely lost. It seems that this gaze\nalso hurt Bubai. Am I going to die? No\nwonder no one can get out of the black\nmist. With such a being in the black\nmist, even a gold level expert would\nprobably die. Sumu never imagined that\nhe would die just because a certain\nbeing glanced at him. But it doesn't\nmatter anymore. I still want to take a\nlook at you. Whoosh. The silver mark\nbetween his brows tore open, revealing a\nsilver vertical pupil. The cold and\nindifferent vertical pupil met the dark\nyellow vertical pupil on the dome, as if\ntwo gods were staring at each other. The\nmoment the silver vertical pupils\nappeared, the murmurss in Sum Mu&lt;unk&gt;s\nears vanished instantly, as if they had\nnever happened, like an illusion.\nHowever, the trend of physical collapse\ndid not abate, and his body was simply\nunable to withstand the gaze of the\neyes. Without the slightest hesitation,\nSumu instantly activated his silver\nvertical pupil. Boom! A dazzling silver\nlight burst forth from his eyes,\ntransforming into a silver pillar that\nconnected heaven and earth and slammed\ninto the dark yellow vertical pupils.\nThe silver beam of light was very thin,\nlike a toothpick poking into a giant\nbubble, accompanied by a loud popping\nsound. Bang! The dark yellow eyeball\nburst open, and countless thick\nyellowish green paw streams fell like\nrain, landing on the rock with a violent\ncorrosive sound. Sumu immediately downed\nthe last bottle of vitality potion to\nrecover from the depletion caused by his\nsilver eyes. His movements were as agile\nas a dancer, constantly dodging the\nfalling pus. The yellowish green pus\ncontained some kind of egg-shaped solid,\nwhich was wrapped in the viscous pus and\nshattered on the ground. A snake man\ncovered in black scales with a snake-ike\nbody but with hands and feet crawled\nout. Its dark yellow vertical pupils\nstared intently at Sumu as if it had\nspotted its prey. all things in the\nuniverse. Based on the principle of\nstriking first, Sumu directly activated\nan illusion to try to deceive the snake\nman, but he failed. Although a brief\nlook of doubt appeared in the snake\nman's eyes, his gaze never left him. Is\nit thermally sensitive? It seems that\nsnake people possess some of the talents\nthat snake should have. As is wellknown,\nsnakes have very poor eyesight. They do\nnot rely on sight to catch prey, but\nrather on thermal sensing. They can\ndetect infrared radiation emitted by\nsurrounding objects. Sumu never expected\nto be so unlucky. His originally\npowerful all things in the world had\nencountered its nemesis one after\nanother. Moreover, these snake people\nhad strong mental power and could not be\nhypnotized instantly like ordinary\npeople. Gradually, more and more snake\npeople were born, their numbers\nexceeding a thousand and continuing to\nsurge. Like newborns, they adapted to\ntheir newly formed bodies and driven by\ntheir instinct to feed, set their sights\non Sumu. Sumu had already run far away.\nHe wasn't stupid. How could he sit and\nwait to die? Now it seemed that the huge\neyeball from before was some kind of\nmother organism designed to incubate\nthese snakemen. He ran wildly at\nbreakneck speed, quickly leaving the\nsnake men far behind. But this short\ndistance wasn't enough for him to\nescape. As the snake men were also\nincreasing in speed, their growth rate\nis astonishing. They go from being as\nunsteady as babies to walking briskly in\nless than a minute. Although Sumu was no\nlonger in sight, they seem to possess\nsome special sense, locking onto Sumu\nfirmly and following closely behind\nthese snakemen. And what is the origin\nof their enormous eyeballs? Even as he\nran, Sumu remained calm and thoughtful.\nHe even felt that the giant eyeball was\nrelated to a deity and that it resembled\nthe primordial angel from before. It was\nalso the primordial angel's power that\nhad pierced the eyeball. If eyeballs are\ngods, then aren't these snake men the\noffspring of gods? The nightmare world\nis indeed fascinating. How many secrets\nare still hidden here? He ran for about\nhalf an hour, but the footsteps in the\nblack fog behind him were still\nfollowing. And there was also a kind of\nfriction and crawling sound mixed in,\nlike countless venomous snakes\nslithering across the ground. He knew\nthat the snake man had grown again from\nrunning on his legs at the beginning to\nnow using both his legs and snake tail.\nH. A snake flicking its tongue came from\nbehind Sumu. A snake man had already\nrushed over, opened its blood red mouth,\nand bit him fiercely with its sharp\nfangs. As if he had eyes in the back of\nhis head, Sumu ducked to avoid the\nattack, then quickly turned around and\ndelivered a precise mega force fist to\nthe snake's head. When the fist touched\nthe opponent's black scales, it felt\nlike hitting steel, or rather like\nhitting Yong, daunching himself. Bang!\nThe snake man was knocked several meters\naway, but it merely shook its head and\nstood up again as if nothing had\nhappened. At this moment, Sumu was like\na newbie who had accidentally entered a\nhellish dungeon, unable to even defeat a\nsingle monster. The black mist, which\neven gold level experts struggled to\nescape, is indeed terrifying. This is\nonly the beginning of the exploration,\nand no one knows how many terrifying\nmonsters are still hidden in this\nendless black mist. If nothing\nunexpected happens, I'm really going to\ndie this time. Sumu sighed slightly, as\nif he was regretting something. He\nwasn't lamenting his own life, but\nrather that he had just discovered such\nan interesting place, only to have to\nstop exploring just the tip of the\niceberg of a nightmare world. By this\ntime, many snake people had gathered\naround. Their growth rate after maturing\nhad surpassed that of Sumu. Eyes unique\nto cold-blooded animals, stared at him,\ntheir gaze filled only with predatory\ninstincts. pupil between his eyebrows\nlit up. This was his only way to kill\nthe snake man. But unfortunately, he\ncould only use it once. Boom! The silver\nbeam of light illuminated the endless\nblack mist once more, piercing through a\nline of snakemen. Their hard black\nscales were like paper in front of the\nsilver light, and a single strike took\naway hundreds of snake men. After the\nblow, Sumu's breathing became erratic,\nand a sense of powerlessness washed over\nhis body. He could only barely stay\nupright by relying on the snake\npatterned wooden cane in his hand pupil\nthree times in one day and his body was\ncompletely exhausted. If it weren't for\nhis powerful mental strength, he would\nhave already fainted. At this point, he\nwas in a complete predicament. His\nphysical and mental strength were both\nexhausted. Bubai was seriously injured\nand in a deep sleep, and he had almost\nused up his extraordinary medicine. The\nsnake men who had been charging forward\nstopped in their tracks, a primal fear\nflickering in their cold. serpentine\neyes. Clearly, they were terrified by\nthe power of the primordial angel and\nhesitated to advance. The situation\nreached a stalemate. One side was\npowerless to act while the other dared\nnot. The two sides faced each other in\nthe black mist and all around was\nsilent. Chapter 114. The divine\nmessenger. Huh? Sumu chuckled softly.\nAre you all so timid? Since you don't\ndare to come over, then I'm going to\nsleep. After saying that, he ignored the\nthousands of snake men around him who\nwere eyeing him menacingly, sat down on\nthe cold, rocky ground, propped his\nelbows on his thighs, rested his chin on\nhis hands, and fell asleep. After he\nfell asleep, the snakes, who had been\nquiet all along, finally overcame their\nfear and approached him step by step.\nThey moved very slowly, hesitating with\neach step, but never stopped. The scene\nwas terrifying. If anyone else had\nwitnessed it, they might have fainted on\nthe spot. Within the endless black mist,\nan elegant gentleman in a suit, and Tai\nslept peacefully. Surrounding him were\ncountless snake men with dark yellow\nvertical pupils and black scales and\nlimbs. They slowly closed the circle,\ndrawing ever closer, just as the\nencirclement shrank to less than 5 m.\n\"Huh,\" Sumu stretched and yawned as he\nwoke up from his dream. He had slept for\na full minute, but including the time\nfrom falling asleep to waking up, his\nactual sleep time was less than a\nminute. However, the recovery of mental\nenergy is not related to sleep time. As\nlong as he enters a dream and wakes up,\nhis mental energy will be fully\nreplenished and increase by 1%. Sumu's\nsudden action startled the snake people\naround him, who instinctively took\nseveral steps back. They stared intently\nat Sumu, not daring to make any rash\nmoves. Haha, interesting. Sumu smiled,\nthen slowly stood up, a simple action\nthat made the snake people take several\nsteps back again. However, he didn't\nexpect to scare the snakemen away with\nintimidation. That was unrealistic. The\nsnakeman clearly didn't have human\nintelligence and wouldn't play the game\nof betting that his gun was unloaded.\nTaking advantage of the snake man's\nhesitation, Sumu attempted to save\nhimself. He poured his immense spiritual\npower into Bubai's body to help him\nrecover from his injuries and see if he\ncould awaken him. Perhaps there's always\na way out. With the influx of spiritual\nenergy, Bubai really showed signs of\nawakening. For Bubai, spiritual energy\nwas the best medicine. But the snake men\nwouldn't give him much time. They had\nwaited too long and could no longer\ncontain themselves. One of the snake men\ntentatively approached Sumu. Buzz pupil\nbetween his eyebrows. The snake man's\nface immediately showed fear and he\nretreated repeatedly. The silver light\nalso dimmed. Sumu didn't have the\nstrength to fire the silver light again.\nHe had only used his mental power to\nslightly activate the silver eyes, which\nwas just to scare the snake. This scare\ntactic was very effective and it managed\nto keep the snake man in place for\nanother minute. Snake people grow\nextremely fast. This is more reflected\nin their physical development than in\ntheir intelligence. A minute later, the\nsnake man couldn't hold back any longer.\nAnd then Sum Moo's silver vertical\npupils lit up with silver light again.\nThe two were like a man and woman of\nhigh skill level, constantly pulling and\nprobing each other. Gradually, the\nsilver vertical pupils became less and\nless intimidating to them. They seemed\nto realize that Sumu was bluffing and\nfinally couldn't hold back any longer,\nhissing intimidating sounds\ncontinuously. Just as the snake men were\nabout to swarm forward, Sumu had already\ngrasped Bou&lt;unk&gt;s hand. Yes, Bubai had\nawakened. Although extremely weak, she\neventually woke up. Hiss. The snake\npeople sensed something was wrong, and\ntens of thousands of them rushed\nforward, but they missed. Sumu's figure\ndisappeared into thin air, leaving only\nhis shadow on the ground. H, h, hiss.\nThe snake people seemed to be caught in\nsome kind of anger, constantly attacking\nthe shadows on the ground and smashing\nthe rock layer where the shadows were,\nbut it was no use. In the shadow space,\nSumu continued to sleep. He had almost\nexhausted his mental energy in trying to\nwake Bubai. But that didn't matter.\nMental energy was free for him, and he\ncould use it as he pleased. In his\ndream, he observed the snake people\noutside. Those snake people were a bit\nstubborn, just circling around the\nshadow and refusing to leave. He kept\nthinking of counter measures. First of\nall, there were no supplies in the\nshadow space, so he couldn't last long.\nIt was okay if there was no food, but\nthe key was that there was no water.\nGiven his physical condition, he could\ndie if he didn't drink water for 3 days.\nSecondly, 3 days is enough to barely\nrecover some physical strength. If\noverdrawn, one might be able to launch\nthe silver light again. But the question\nis after launching it, whether one will\nhave the strength to escape is also a\nquestion mark. After much deliberation,\nhe realized he had only two options.\nEither wait and see if the snake men\nretreated first or if he died of thirst\nor once he regained his strength, fight\nto the death for a chance of survival.\nIn the end, Sumu decided to wait 3 days.\nIf the snake man left, all the better.\nIf not, he would take a gamble and try.\nA day later, some of the snake people\nretreated, but most remained in place,\nwaiting and occasionally trying to\nattack the shadow. 2 days later, some of\nthe snake people retreated again. This\ntime, about half left, but more than a\nthousand remained to guard the area. On\nthe third day, none of the more than\n1,000 snakemen left. They were still\nwaiting. Sumu had already spent three\ncomfortable years. He extended his dream\ntime and didn't find it boring. He spent\nhis days eating, drinking, playing, and\nenjoying life in his dream. He would\noccasionally destroy worlds, become the\nheavenly emperor, and even rewatched\nuntil death do us part and wre havoc in\nthe dream world. On this day, he woke up\nfrom his dream, feeling his body recover\nslightly. He estimated that he could\nbarely manage one more round. So, he\nprepared to go out and meet the more\nthan 1,000 snake people. Whoosh! Sumu's\nfigure emerged from the shadows,\ninstantly attracting the attention of\nthe remaining snake people. In the past\n3 days, they had grown even larger, not\nonly exceeding 2 m in height, but also\nshowing muscle bulges beneath their\nblack scales. With a hiss, they didn't\nhesitate at all this time and pounced\ndirectly on Sumu. Sumu didn't tolerate\nthem either. A dazzling silver beam shot\nout like a laser weapon, instantly\npiercing through the snake men in a\nstraight line. The terrifying power\ncaused fear to appear on the snake men's\nfaces. Taking advantage of their moment\nof fear, Sumu prepared to break through.\nBut the next second, an extremely weak\ndizziness surged into his heart. His\nfair hands barely managed to grip the\nsnake patterned wooden cane, which\nprevented him from falling to the\nground. \"Alas, the human body is still\ntoo weak. Here it is. The holy light is\nhere.\" A joyful voice suddenly rang out\nfrom the distant black mist. I have\nfinally found the messenger of the gods.\nPraise be to the primordial angels.\nAnother voice choked with sobs came from\nthe black mist and grew closer. Get out\nof my way, you children of evil gods. Do\nnot harm the divine messenger. Several\nwhooshing sounds rang out, and Sumu\nbarely managed to look up. He saw\nseveral white-roed figures suddenly\nappear in the black mist, their\nexpressions excited and fanatical. White\nrobed figures, divine messengers. The\nscene he had witnessed at the angel\nstatue flashed through his mind where a\ngroup of people in black and white robes\nwere simultaneously worshiping the\nstatue. His thoughts came to an abrupt\nhalt. The continuous overexertion of his\nbody coupled with three days without a\ndrop of water caused him to faint.\nChapter 115. The truth about the\nnightmare world. Warmth. The warmth of\nbasking in the sun. This was Sumu's\nfirst feeling after waking up. The\ndivine messenger has awakened. Great.\nThe divine messenger has finally\nawakened. Praise be to the primordial\nangel. Thump, thump. A dozen or so\npeople in white robes knelt down around\nSumu, their expressions devout and\nfervent as they chanted incantations,\nsome even shedding tears of emotion.\nSumu glanced around and found that his\neyes were healed. He no longer needed to\nrely on the silver vertical pupils for\nvision. Not only that, but the physical\ndamage caused by being stared at by the\ngiant eyeball had also healed. and his\nphysical strength had even returned to\nits peak. He was leaning against a\nsimple rock chair which was being\ncarried by two men in white robes. \"Put\nme down,\" Sumu commanded with practiced\nease. He had a rough idea of why these\nwhite-roed men were so fanatical. It was\nprobably because of his silver vertical\npupils. Upon hearing this, the two men\nin white robes quickly put down their\nrock chairs and joined the kneeling\nworship team. What happened to those\nsnake people? reporting to the divine\nenvoy. The evil gods offspring have been\nkilled by us. These filthy beasts dared\nto attempt to harm you. They deserve to\ndie. It's a pity we didn't bring enough\nmen this time. Otherwise, we would have\ncaptured them all, taken them back to\nthe divine cult, and burned them to\ndeath with the sacred fire. The one who\nanswered was a tall man in white robes.\nHe seemed to be of higher status than\nthe other men in white robes because\nonly his white robe was trimmed with\nred. Sumu asked calmly, \"Killed them\nall.\" The tall man in white robes\ntrembled, his head almost touching the\nground and choked out. Reporting to the\ndivine envoy, \"It is my incompetence\nthat I failed to kill all the offspring\nof the evil god. I know that every\nmoment these offspring of the evil god\nlive is a desecration of the primordial\nangels. But this time, we have too few\npeople, so we can only break through\nwith you first. But rest assured, once\nwe return to the primordial god cult, I\nwill immediately report to his holiness\nthe pope. And then we will ensure that\nall these evil god offspring are wiped\nout. The primordial god cult. The pope.\nIt sounds like a cult that worships\nprimordial angels. But is there really a\nhuman cult within this black mist? Are\nthese white robed figures human or\nnightmare creatures? Seeing Su Mu\nremained silent, the tall man in white\nrobes grew even more fearful. It is my\nincompetence that is the fault of this\nhumble man. Please punish me, your\nexcellency. No, you did very well. The\nprimordial angels saw everything you\ndid, Sumu said gently, patting the tall\nman in white robes on the head. Upon\nhearing this, the tall man in white\nrobes seemed to experience a mental\norgasm, trembling with excitement. Large\ntears dripped onto the rocky ground as\nhe frantically couted, shouting, \"Praise\nbe to the primordial angels. Praise be\nto the divine messengers.\" Seeing the\nother person's fanatical appearance,\nSumu suddenly realized that if he were\nasked to die now, he would commit\nsuicide without hesitation. May I have\nyour name? Your Excellency, my name is\nJuan. Juan? Sumu frowned slightly.\nWhat's the surname? We humans have no\nsurnames. All followers must erase their\nsurnames after joining the primordial\ngod cult. Surnames represent family and\nancestors. Followers of the primordial\ngod cult cannot have any symbols or\nexternal objects. We are believers of\nthe primordial angel and can only\nsymbolize the primordial angel. Sumu\nhadn't expected that the primordial god\ncults brainwashing of its followers had\nreached such an exaggerated level. Raise\nyour head. Yes, your excellency. One\nimmediately raised his head, revealing\nan extremely pale face. Even a corpse\nthat had been dead for 3 days wasn't as\npale as him. Everyone look up. Soon,\nmore than a dozen people in white robes\nalso raised their heads, their faces\nequally pale. Upon seeing this, Sumu\nunderstood that these people must have\nlived in the black mist for a long time.\nAnd because they had never seen the sun,\ntheir skin was extremely pale. How did\nyou find me, the divine messenger? My\nlord, we are an exploration team sent by\nthe Pope to find heaven. There are\nhundreds of such teams almost scattered\nthroughout half of hell. 3 days ago, our\nteam suddenly sensed the aura of holy\nlight. So, we rushed here and ended up\nmeeting you, my lord. Oh, I didn't\nexpect that you could recognize me, even\nthough I'm in a mortal body. The eye\nbetween your eyebrows is the legendary\neye of God. Exactly the same as his\nholiness, the Pope's eyes. I would\nrather die than mistake it. Wanjing\nlooked at Su Mu&lt;unk&gt;s brow with\nreverence. Does your pope also have the\neye of God? When the Pope was mentioned,\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s expression of awe deepened. His\nholiness, the pope, is the person\nclosest to God. He can even hear the\nteachings of the primordial angels. So,\nhe was also granted the eye of God. Your\nholiness. If the Pope knew that you had\ncome, he would be very happy. Sumu\nsmiled non-committally. It seemed that\nhe couldn't go to the primordial god\ncult. He wasn't a follower of the\nprimordial angel. He had only devoured a\ndrop of the angel's blood through a\ndream. If the pope wasn't exaggerating\nand could really communicate with the\nprimordial angel, then going there would\nbe like walking into a trap. Juan\ncontinued fervently. Divine messenger,\nyou must have come down from heaven,\nright? Are you here to guide us to\nheaven? Heaven? Hell? Sumu's eyes\nflickered slightly. Hell must refer to\nthe world of black mist. But what about\nheaven? He didn't know what heaven was\nthat one was talking about. Could it be\nthe real world? I, the messenger of the\ngods, have come from heaven, but not to\nguide you. For only the most devout\nbelievers are qualified to go to heaven.\nAs soon as the words were spoken, the\ndozen or so people in white robes became\nexcited and rushed to prove their piety.\nMy Lord, I was born into the primordial\ngod cult. My purpose in this life is to\ngo to heaven and return to the embrace\nof the primordial angels. My Lord, I am\ndevout enough that I can recite all 108\nBibles in the church. One was not to be\noutdone. Divine Envoy, I am the high\npriest of the primordial god cult, and I\nam the most devout.\" Sumu pushed up his\nbrown tinted glasses and said\nindifferently, \"Piety is not something\nthat can be said with words. As for who\ncan go to heaven, this divine messenger\nhas his own considerations.\" When he\nspoke, the surrounding noise instantly\nfell silent. Let's talk about your\nunderstanding of heaven and hell first.\nPeople who can't even understand the\nconcepts are not qualified to go to\nheaven. Upon hearing this, when he\nimmediately became excited, his face\nturning red, as if the question had\ntouched a nerve, he almost blurted out,\n\"The place we are in now is hell. Heaven\nis where the gods exist, and the kingdom\nof the primordial angels is in heaven.\"\nSumu frowned slightly. His words were as\ngood as saying nothing. Your\nunderstanding of heaven and hell is so\nshallow. Chapter 116. Life is born in\nhell. Juan's expression changed\ndrastically in an instant as if the sky\nhad collapsed. He was so anxious that\nhis face turned red. No, no, your\nexcellency, please give me another\nchance. I haven't finished speaking yet.\nExplain. Hell is located beneath the\nsurface of the earth and is the habitat\nof humans and nightmares. Some extremely\nevil evil gods are also hidden in hell.\nThose snake people just now were the\noffspring of the snake god. The snake\ngod likes to lay eggs on the rock walls.\nA serpent god laying eggs. Could the\nenormous eyeball we just saw have been\nnothing more than the serpent god's egg?\nHeaven is located above the earth's\nsurface. It is the most beautiful place\non earth with an ever burning sun and an\nunchanging starry sky. There will be no\nworries or sorrows there. You can enjoy\nthe ultimate bliss. Listen to the\nteachings of God and there will be no\nbirth, old age, sickness or death. Sumu\nbelieved that one was telling the truth.\nBut the truth spoken by fanatics had\nbeen embellished too much by art. There\nwas no such place in the world. There\nwas only one sentence in it that could\nbe believed. Heaven is above the surface\nof the earth and hell is below the\nsurface of the earth. This confirmed his\nprevious speculation that the nightmare\nworld is located beneath the surface.\nBut why would nightmares exist\nunderground? And how were nightmare\napostles born? More and more questions\narose in his mind. Then why are you in\nhell? Wanie was taken aback, seemingly\nsurprised, but still answered honestly.\nHumans are born into hell. Your\nancestors have been in hell for\ngenerations. One nodded, a slight\nbitterness rising in his heart. The\nquestion from the divine messenger\nreminded him of a primal believer who\nonce asked a beggar, \"Since you can't\nget food, why don't you eat meat?\" Now,\nthe messenger gave him the same feeling.\nThis is probably because people in\nheaven will never understand the\nsuffering of hell. Why are they in hell?\nIf they could go to heaven, why would\nthey be in hell? Isn't it because they\ncan't go up? Yes, your excellency. It's\nnot just my ancestors, but everyone in\nhell. This is the origin of humanity,\nwhile heaven is God's paradise. Humans\nare born with sin, and only by devoutly\nbelieving in the primordial angels and\nwashing away their sins can they go to\nheaven. Ignoring the artistic\nembellishments in Juan's words, Sumu\nroughly understood that the humans here\nhad been living in hell for a long time\nto the point that the surface of the\nearth had become a legendary paradise\nwhich the church used for its religious\npropaganda. Do gods truly exist hidden\nin the real world? Are gods merely\nproducts of nightmares? Or is what they\nsay true? Perhaps the earliest humans\nreally did originate underground. Sumu\nmade this judgment because there was no\nlanguage barrier between the two sides.\nThey spoke the common language of the\nfederation which is used by humans in\nthe real world. Therefore, the two\nshould be the same world. The real world\nis on the ground and the nightmare world\nis underground. It is just unknown\nwhether the origin of mankind is on the\nground or underground. Interesting. The\nenvironment in hell is so harsh. What do\nyou usually eat? Where do you live? One\nUFA was certain that the divine\nmessenger came from heaven. Because only\nin that blissful paradise where one had\nno worries about food and clothing would\nsuch a question so ignorant of human\nsuffering be asked. Reporting to the\ndivine envoy, we live in a dream world.\nWithin this endless black mist lie\ncountless nightmares, their surface is a\ndream barrier that can isolate the black\nmist and the spying of evil gods. They\nlook like semi-transparent bubbles and\nare the habitats of nightmares. Some are\nsuitable for human survival with false\nsunlight and land while others are\ndesolate places. Humans in hell survive\nby exploring and conquering the dream\nworld. The headquarters of the\nprimordial god cult is a dream. The\nlargest known dream explored by humanity\ncapable of housing tens of millions of\npeople. Answers one gave, the more\nquestions Sumu had. Have you seen people\nfrom heaven before? Sumu wondered. Since\nthese people lived and dwelled in\nnightmares, they might have seen\nnightmare apostles, also known as people\nfrom heaven. Unexpectedly, one shook his\nhead. I've never seen it. The human race\ncalls the area they occupy the center of\nhell and divides hell into five major\nprisons: east, west, south, north, and\ncentral. The human race only occupies\nthe central prison, and they haven't\neven fully explored it. There are\nlegends of people from heaven coming to\nthe other prisons, but no one has ever\nseen them with their own eyes. Where are\nwe now? Eastern prison. His holiness the\nPope believes that there is no entrance\nto heaven in the central prison. So\nevery year he sends exploration teams to\nthe other four domains to search for it.\nBut very few people can return alive.\nBut this time is different. One's\nexpression suddenly became fanatical. We\nhave found the divine messenger. The\ndivine messenger will guide devout\nbelievers to heaven. Divine Messenger,\nplease come back to the primordial god\ncult with us. The Pope will be very\nhappy to see you.\" Sumu smiled slightly.\nThe Pope would probably be happy to kill\nhim, right? Just as he was about to\nrefuse, a white robed man's expression\nsuddenly changed drastically. His eyes\nshone with a faint light as he stared\nintently at the black mist behind them.\nHe hurriedly said, \"Divine Envoy, those\nevil god offspring are catching up.\nLet's hurry back to the primordial god\ncult. We can't go back now. It's at\nleast half a year's journey from here to\nthe divine sect. The serpent god's\noffspring are notoriously difficult to\ndeal with. Once they set their sights on\ntheir prey, they're almost never going\nto give up. We won't be able to reach\nthe divine sect at all. One looked very\nanxious and quickly shielded Sumu behind\nhim. The best course of action now is to\nfind the nearest dream to hide in and\nwait until the serpent god's offspring\ndisperse before setting off back to the\ncult. Everyone, the time has come to\ntest whether you can go to heaven. If\nyou die to protect the divine messenger,\nthe great primordial angel will surely\nguide your souls to heaven. Upon hearing\nthis, the dozen or so men in white robes\ninstantly became fanatical, even\nscrambling to get to the front. I'll\ncover you from behind. And me? I will\ngive my life for the divine messenger.\nGet out of my way. What right do you\nhave? I've been a member of the church\nthe longest, so if anyone's going to\ngive their life, it should be me first.\nAn elderly man in white robes rudely\npushed the others aside. Seeing that\neveryone was about to fight amongst\nthemselves, one directly designated\nthree people to hold off the others,\nthus preventing a quarrel. The three\nchosen people were as if they had\nreceived tickets to heaven. Their faces\nshowed no fear, only boundless ecstasy.\nThe others looked at the three with\nimmense envy and jealousy. Soon, led by\nthe crowd, Sumu sat on the stone seat\nagain and was carried away. Sizzle. The\nroars of the snake men came from afar\nand more and more snake men were visible\nto the naked eye rushing out of the\nblack mist and charging towards the\ngroup. The three white robed figures who\nremained at the rear roared praise the\nprimordial angels sacrifice. The next\nmoment splat. The three men in white\nrobes pulled out daggers and slashed\ntheir wrists. Blood gushing out. They\nused the blood to draw a strange\nscribbled magic circle under their feet.\nThen let the blood flow freely, uttering\nin human mutterings. Boom! Three blazing\nflames erupted from the magic array\nbeneath their feet, engulfing the three\nwhite robed figures in holy fire. Their\nbodies emitted a burnt smell as they\ncharged headlong into the snakeman army.\nChapter 117. Taking the fanatic back.\nBefore they had even run halfway, the\nthree of them had almost turned into\nhuman-shaped charcoal, their flesh and\nblood shrinking at a visible rate. When\nthe two collided, boom! Boom, boom,\nboom. Three incredibly intense flames\nshot into the sky, exploding like\nincendiary bombs among the snakemen\narmy. The flames of faith formed a sea\nof fire, halting the snake men's\nadvance. Countless snake men were burned\nby the sacred fire, letting out mournful\nhowls. Sitting on the stone seat\nwatching, Sumu felt for the first time\nthat his hypnosis skills were not the\nbest in the world, and that perhaps the\nhypnosis of the primordial god cult was\neven better than his own. He could send\nhis underlings to their deaths. But such\nself- emilation was extremely painful.\nAnd in the midst of extreme pain, the\nunderlings were very likely to break\nfree from hypnosis. Unless, like the\nprimal god cult, they were subjected to\ndaily hypnosis and brainwashing. The\ngroup ran at breakneck speed. The\nmembers of the primordial god cult were\nvery professional. Even at extremely\nhigh speeds, they maintained the\nstability of the stone seat, and Sumu on\nthe stone seat remained as steady as\nMount Thai. he thought for a moment,\nthen pondered. Do you know where my\nrecent dreams are? One respectfully\nreplied, \"I don't know. The black mist\ncan obscure the location of dreams,\nmaking them sometimes impossible to see\nwith the naked eye. It's all a matter of\nluck, but please rest assured, divine\nenvoy. We encountered a dream a month\nago and stayed there for a while. The\nprimordial god cult possesses a divine\nart of tracing origins. Once we get rid\nof these snake god offspring, I will use\nthis divine art to find the dream.\" we\nstayed in before. Tracing the origins,\ndivine arts, what kind of power system\nis this? It doesn't sound like law.\nHowever, Sumu did not ask. As a divine\nmessenger from heaven, he could be\nunaware of the situation in hell. But it\nwould be too strange if he didn't even\nknow about divine arts. Judging from the\nname, it sounded like a power bestowed\nby the gods. You encountered a dream a\nmonth ago, which is too far away. When I\nfirst descended to the mortal realm, I\nencountered a dream that was much\ncloser. Let's go here first. If someone\nwere overjoyed upon hearing this and had\na dream that was closer to home, who\nwould want to go to such lengths?\nHowever, since I am inhabiting a mortal\nbody, some divine spells are temporarily\ninconvenient to use. You will have to\nfind them. They had no doubt whatsoever.\nOn the contrary, they felt it was only\nnatural. The divine messenger's status\nwas so noble. How could they trouble the\ndivine messenger with such a trivial\nmatter as finding a way? Yes, your\nexcellency. About 5 minutes later, the\nhissing sound behind them disappeared.\nOne stopped and turned around to Sumu\nrespectfully, saying, \"Please, divine\nenvoy, grant me some personal items to\nuse for the tracing and source tracing\ntechnique.\" Sumu nodded, casually took\nout a white handkerchief, and tossed it\nto one. One hurriedly held the\nhandkerchief in both hands as if it were\nsome sacred object, and then handed it\nto one of the men in white robes. After\ntaking the handkerchief, the man in\nwhite robes pulled out a dagger without\nsaying a word, slashed his wrist hard,\nand splattered it. Blood gushed out\ninstantly, and he splashed it along some\nmysterious path, quickly forming a\nrudimentary blood magic circle on the\nground. He then placed a handkerchief in\nthe center of the circle and muttered\nincantations that seemed inhuman. Praise\nthe primordial angels, sacrifice. The\nwhite-roed man suddenly roared, then\nplunged the dagger into his own heart\nwith a thud. He collapsed onto the\nformation, his body covered in blood\nthat seemed to be controlled by some\ninvisible force, spreading wildly across\nthe ground like snakes, stretching\ntowards the distant black mist and\ndrawing a trail of blood. The man in\nwhite robes died, his face contorted\nwith fervor, as if he had accomplished\nsome supreme mission. Is it another\nsacrifice? Sumu suddenly realized that\nthe divine magic they were talking about\nwas sacrifice, wasn't it? To exchange\nsacrifices for the power of the\nprimordial angels. That's wonderful,\ndivine envoy. The primordial angel has\ngiven us guidance. Let's set off. Wan\nKuangi exclaimed, showing no trace of\ngrief for his fallen companion. Sumu\nnodded, and the group followed the trail\nof blood on the ground and set off\nagain. On the way, he casually asked,\n\"One, how far have you progressed in\nyour divine arts?\" As Juan ran wildly, a\nlook of shame appeared on his face. I\nhave been practicing divine arts since I\nwas a child for 30 years now. But so far\nI have only sacrificed more than 10,000\npeople. I am not as good as the bishop\nand the cardinal. I am currently just a\nhigh priest. More than 10,000 people. So\nthis is the origin of the name. In\ncomparison, the primordial angel is not\nmuch better than the serpent god and may\neven be worse. Along the way, Sumu kept\nsubtly probing for information about\ndivine arts and hell. Time flew by and\nhalf an hour later they found a huge\nglowing bubble. Looking through the\nbubbles, you can vaguely see a lush\nforest and scattered headless figures\nmoving about within it. \"Found it,\" Juan\nKuangi exclaimed, taking the lead and\nclearing the way for everyone as they\nplunged into the bubble. \"Instantly, the\nspace changed. The oppressive black mist\ndisappeared, and in its place appeared\nblue sky, white clouds, and a primeval\nforest. Sumu is back, but this time,\nhe's brought his underlings with him.\"\nUpon entering the headless man's dream,\neveryone immediately fell silent, making\nno sound whatsoever. This was as Sumu\nhad instructed them beforehand, having\ninformed them about the headless man.\nOne is quite familiar with headless\npeople. He says that these monsters are\ncalled ear beasts, which feed on sound\nand are extremely cruel. Once they\ncapture a living creature, they do not\nkill it immediately, but imprison it and\ntorture it madly, making the creature\nscream in agony so as to devour more\nsound. Sumu neither agreed nor disagreed\nwith this. He felt that the primordial\ngod cult had no right to say that the\near beasts were cruel. In fact, they\nwere all pretty much the same. Through\nsubtle inquiries, he roughly learned\nsome information. First of all, the\ndivine magic of the primordial god cult\nis sacrifice. They believe that the law\nis the power of evil gods and only the\ndivine power obtained from the\nprimordial angels through sacrifice is\nthe power of justice. It is worth\nmentioning that the primal god cult\nbelieves that all gods except the\nprimordial angels are evil gods. In the\nentire underground world, which is hell,\nonly the middle hell has a large number\nof humans and can barely be called human\nterritory. The other four hells belong\nto nightmares and evil gods. The power\nsystem of the hell humans is very\ndiverse. Some follow the path of law\nlike the superhumans, while many\ncultivate divine arts. Humans do not\nworship just one god. The primordial\nangels are only one of them.\nFurthermore, the methods of practicing\ndivine arts vary greatly depending on\nthe belief. Primordial angels sacrifice\nliving beings and the more living beings\nsacrificed, the more power they gain. It\nis a very versatile method just like the\nsummoning of the sacred fire and tracing\nthe origin. Its application methods are\nquite diverse. According to this\nfanatical believer, the primordial\nangels are omnipotent and can obtain\neverything through sacrifice. Chapter\n118. Effortless. Having obtained so much\ninformation, Sumu was already beginning\nto suspect that the hell race might\nactually be a product of a nightmare\nworld. After all, it's normal for people\nto exist in nightmares, and it's even\nnormal for gods to exist. Whether it is\ntrue or not is not important. What is\nimportant is that the nightmare world is\nreally wonderful. It is much more\ninteresting than the real world. Perhaps\nafter returning to the real world, we\ncan find some clues in it. If what once\nsaid is true and the primordial angels\nlived in heaven, which was also on the\nsurface of the earth, then how could\nthey have left traces in the real world?\nAnother white robed man stabbed him, but\nhe did not die. He only sacrificed a\nlittle blood to draw a sacrificial\narray. With a flash of white light, a\nsemi-transparent light shield enveloped\nSumu and the others. My lord, with this\nsoundproof barrier, we won't be\noverheard by the headless men. We can\nalso listen to your teachings at any\ntime. Please bear with us in this dream\nfor a few days. Once the snake gods\noffspring have left, I will immediately\ntake you to the primordial god cult.\nWuang said, \"Children, you have done\nvery well. You are all devout children\nof the primordial angels.\" Sumu knew how\nto fool fanatics. As soon as he said\nthis, Juan and the others almost\nascended to heaven on the spot. Some\nwere even moved to tears and knelt on\nthe ground to kiss Sumu's shoes. Sumu\ncalmly dodged the fanatic's mouth and\nsaid indifferently. This divine\nmessenger has one more thing for you to\ndo. Please give your orders, your\nexcellency. We will do anything, even\ndie a thousand deaths. The fervent\nvoices almost blew the soundproof\nbarrier off. When I descended to the\nmortal realm this time, I was\nunfortunately discovered by the metal\nevil god. Therefore, he sent his\nsubordinates to the mortal realm to try\nto destroy my current physical body and\nprevent me from leading my devout people\nto heaven. What? One and the others eyes\ninstantly turned red. Preventing them\nfrom going to heaven was even more\nhateful than killing their father. What\nkind of deity is the metal evil god? How\ndare he send people to intercept and\nkill you, divine envoy? The metal gods\nare one of the evil gods in heaven who\nare hostile to the primordial angels.\nThey are dissatisfied with the\nprimordial angels rule over heaven. So\nthey joined forces to try to deal with\nthe primordial angels. They were\ndefeated but were still unwilling to\naccept it. They often hide in the dark\nand cause trouble. This time they\nlearned that I, the god, had descended\nto the mortal world. So they specially\nsent their retinue here. Sumu made\nthings up off the cuff. Just as he was\nunaware of information about hell. These\npeople were completely ignorant of\ninformation about heaven and the right\nto interpret everything belonged to\nthem. One immediately flew into a rage.\nMy lord, where are the followers of the\nmetal god? I will go and kill them right\nnow. Sumu said indifferently. This\ndivine messenger has already sensed that\nhe is in this dream. This creature is\nhumanoid, but it has no flesh or blood\nand is made entirely of metal.\nCompletely made of metal. Wii trembled\nviolently. To dare to so desecrate flesh\nand blood, he truly is a follower of an\nevil god and deserves to die. Divine\nenvoy, rest assured, I will certainly\nslay him.\nDeep in the forest, Mu Chong, covered in\nleaves, crouched fertively behind a\nlarge tree. This was the last cyborg\nbody he had left. The previous one had\ndied in the headless man's lair while\ntrying to kill Sumu, so he became\nextremely cautious. With only one life\nleft, they stuffed leaves into the metal\njoints and even made leaf shoes to cover\nthe metal feet in order to reduce the\nnoise when moving. He had no experience\nin completing the nightmare, nor did he\nknow how to find the source of the\nnightmare. Although he guessed that the\nclues might be in the headless man's\nlair, he dared not go there with only\none life left. So, he decided to use the\nstupidest and safest method, which was\nto wait. Wait a few days until the\nnightmare naturally ends. Damsumo Mu\nChong cursed Sumu countless times in his\nheart. He had a bright future ahead of\nhim, but everything was ruined because\nof Sumu. A dignified silver level expert\nhad actually been reduced to wrapping\nhimself in leaves and squatting in a\ngrass pit. The mere thought of Sumu\nfilled him with rage. Now 3 days had\npassed, and he was almost certain that\nSumu had died in the black mist, and\nthat his death was far too easy. Just as\nMu Chong was cursing, he suddenly tinsed\nup and even dared not move his metal\nprosthetic eye because several figures\nappeared in his thermal imaging camera.\nThe headless people have arrived. No.\nWait, how come these people have heads?\nCould they be new nightmare apostles? My\nlord, the metal gods followers are\nbehind that tree. I sense their\nspiritual fluctuations. They are not\nweak, but they are too foolish. They\nactually abandoned their physical bodies\nand parasetize their souls in the metal\nwithout the protection of a physical\nbody. Their souls are like duckweed\nwithout any foundation. One sneered,\n\"How do you plan to deal with him?\"\nSumu's words carried a hint of\nconsideration. One X understood that\nthis was a test from the divine\nmessenger and quickly said, \"This\nbeing's body seems to be made of\nmithril, indestructible, but I can use\nthe soul-binding divine technique to\neasily capture its soul.\" Sumu's eyes\nflickered slightly. It seemed that he\nhad underestimated Juan's strength.\nFacing a silver level expert could be\ndescribed as effortless. However, one\nstrength should not exceed the silver\nlevel. Otherwise, he wouldn't be being\nchased by the snake people. Let's get\nstarted, Sumu ordered. Yes, your\nexcellency. One looked at the nine white\nrobed men behind him with a serious\nexpression. Let's begin. The nine white\nrobed figures frantically drew their\ndaggers and shouted, \"Praise be to the\nprimordial angels.\" Sacrifice!\nThe nine men plunged daggers deep into\ntheir hearts, then tilted their heads\nand died. One hurriedly squatted down\nand used their blood to draw the\nsacrificial array. Sumu, standing to the\nside, was speechless. He understood for\nthe first time what a generation gap\nmeant. Did this mean it was easy to\nsacrifice all the white robed people\ndirectly? As the sacrificial array was\ncompleted, Wanco began chanting strange\nincantations. Gradually, the corpses of\nall the white robed men burned and\nturned to ashes in a very short time. A\nwisp of green smoke floated above the\nashes. One pointed at the smoke and\nsaid, \"Stop! Whoosh!\" The wisps of smoke\nrose without wind, vaguely transforming\ninto a hand that reached out to grab Mu\nChong from behind a large tree not far\naway. Much Chong, who was originally\nfeeling uneasy, suddenly felt a strong\nalarm bell ring in his heart, and a\nfearful tremor surged from the depths of\nhis soul, as if he were being watched by\nsome unseen force. \"Run, run, run now.\"\nHe didn't have time to think and\ninstinctively wanted to run away.\nHowever, the moment he stood up, the\ngreen smoke arrived and entered the\nmetal gap, almost without any hindrance.\nMuch Chong froze, his metal prosthetic\neye instantly losing its light, and he\nstood motionless. A moment later, Ching\nYen returned, holding a\nsemi-transparent, cloud-like humanoid\nfigure in her large hand. One hurriedly\npulled out a transparent glass bottle\nfrom his person and opened the cap.\nChapter 119. The omnipotent primordial\ngod cult. Whoosh! The translucent\ncloud-like humanoid figure was quickly\nsucked into the bottle. Juan Bao held\nthe bottle above his head like a\ntreasure. My lord, the retinue of the\nmetal god has been apprehended. Sumu\ntook the small bottle. Inside was a\nsmall figure, middle-aged, frantically\nsmashing the bottle wall with a\nterrified expression. It was Muing\nDua&lt;unk&gt;s soul. Muching had no idea what\nhad happened. When he regained\nconsciousness, his soul was already\ninside the small bottle. He was\nterrified, but something even more\nterrifying happened. Suddenly, a huge\nhuman face appeared before him, its eyes\nbigger than his own body. He screamed in\nterror, but the next second he realized\nthat the huge face looked familiar.\nSuumu Muing&lt;unk&gt;s expression changed\ndrastically. He would rather die than\nmistake Sumu&lt;unk&gt;s face. What on earth\nis going on? He looked around in horror\nand then realized that he had been put\ninto a small bottle. It wasn't that Sumu\nhad grown bigger, but that he had\nshrunk. Let me out. Let me out now. Sumu\nexamined the little figure in the bottle\nwith great interest. He suddenly became\nvery interested in divine magic. It was\ntoo versatile. As long as a sacrifice\nwas made, it could do most things.\nHowever, he was only interested and did\nnot intend to learn it because he simply\ncouldn't learn it. The prerequisite for\nlearning the divine arts of the\nprimordial god cult was to believe in\nthe primordial angel. Only in this way\ncould one establish a connection with\nthe angel and then offer sacrifices. He\nis now in the strict sense a blasphemer.\nIf he were to make contact with the\nprimordial angels, he would likely face\ncertain death. Ding, ding, ding. Sumu\nshook the small bottle in his hand, and\nMu Chong inside immediately wobbled and\nflipped, constantly hitting the bottle\nwall and making a crisp sound. Sumu,\nwhat did you do to me? Mu Chong, who was\ndizzy and disoriented from the fall,\nstruggled to his feet and shouted\ntremblingly. Sumu brought the small\nbottle closer, his fair face reflected\nin the transparent glass. Suddenly, a\ncharming smile appeared on his lips as\nhe softly asked, \"Mu Chong,\" \"Mr. Mu,\nare you in despair? Mu Changeng&lt;unk&gt;s\nsoul trembled. In that instant, he felt\nas if he were enveloped by a silent\nterror. Fear permeating his very soul.\nThe dignity and pride of a silver level\nexpert were utterly shattered. Let me\ngo. Please let me go. I have money. I\nhave lots and lots of money. Just let me\ngo. Mr. Mu, I always thought you were a\nrespectable person, but now you are not\nrespectable at all. I hope you will not\nshatter my beautiful image of a silver\nlevel expert. After saying that, Sumu\nignored Mu Changengs please for mercy\nand threw the bottle to want. He had no\nuse for the soul. First of all, he did\nnot lack spiritual power and even wanted\nto suppress the growth of spiritual\npower. Secondly, he did not know how to\nuse the sacrificial divine technique.\nOne respectfully put away the bottle. My\nlord, now that the metal evil gods\nminions have been dealt with, let's find\na place to rest for a while. Once the\nsnake gods offspring outside have\nretreated, I will immediately take you\nto the primordial god cult. Sumu nodded\nwithout refuting, but he was calculating\nin his heart. He definitely couldn't go\nto the primordial god cult. First, the\njourney was too far, and second, it\nwould be easy to expose himself if he\nmet the pope. He could explore it when\nhe was stronger, but definitely not now.\nBut how do we convince Juan? He glanced\nsideways at Juan, whose face was full of\nfanaticism and thought that persuading\nhim would be a very simple matter. To a\nfanatical believer, the words of the\nmessenger of God were a holy decree. He\ncould just make up a reason to let one\ngo back first. However, he did not\nintend to let one go so easily. One was\nnot weak and had strange methods. He had\nto squeeze out the last bit of value\nfrom him. With this thought in mind,\nSumu said, \"10,000.\" One hurriedly stood\nup and stood respectfully to his side,\nsaying, \"Your excellency is here. This\ndivine messenger is hungry. My lord, I\nhave food here.\" One was extremely\nexcited, as if helping the Lord was a\ngreat honor. He quickly pulled out a\nsmall sheep-skin bag from his body,\nreached inside, and soon pulled out a\npiece of dark dried meat. He couldn't\ntell what kind of meat it was, but it\nwas very long, almost as long as an\nadult's arm. Sumu's eyes flickered\nslightly. A storage treasure. One\nrespectfully handed over the dried meat,\nbut Sumu didn't even glance at it.\nInstead, he said indifferently, \"Do you\nthink this divine envoy is only fit to\neat this kind of garbage?\" Sensing Su\nMu&lt;unk&gt;s displeasure, Juan's expression\nchanged drastically, and he knelt down\nwith a thud. I deserve to die. I deserve\nto die. What kind of status does the\ndivine envoy have? Such vulgar things\nare naturally unworthy of you, but all I\nhave on me are these dried meats. What\nwould you like to eat? I will go find\nthem right away. Seeing his upright\nattitude, Sumu&lt;unk&gt;s expression softens\nslightly. Hell is far less barren than\nheaven. I, the divine messenger, will\nnot make things difficult for you. Go\nand find some golden eyes. In hell, only\nthings like these are barely edible.\nWani was stunned. My lord, may I ask\nwhat the golden eye is? Seeing\nWani&lt;unk&gt;s blank expression, Sumu\nrealized that the name of the golden eye\nmight be different in the two places.\nAfter all, the golden eye was the name\ngiven by superhumans in the real world.\nSo he took out the golden leaf that\nMurong Mungley had given him earlier.\nThese are leaves from the golden eye.\nOne took a look and blurted out, \"Holy\nradiance fruit, divine envoy. These are\nthe leaves of the holy radiance fruit.\"\nLegend has it that the fruit was formed\nfrom the radiance of the primordial\nangels that fell upon hell. It is called\nthe golden eye in heaven. Sumu\ncompletely ignored the primordial angel\nmentioned in Juan's words. In the eyes\nof fanatics, the whole world belongs to\nthe primordial angel. So naturally,\neverything can be related to the\nprimordial angel. At this moment, one\ncouldn't help but gasp. He hadn't\nexpected that such a rare item as the\nholy radiance fruit would be barely\npalatable to the divine envoy. What do\npeople in heaven eat everyday? He simply\ncouldn't imagine. This further\nstrengthened his belief that he wanted\nto go to heaven. Can you get it?\nWanhun&lt;unk&gt;s expression hardened and he\nquickly replied, \"Yes.\" Although the\nholy radiance golden eye is precious. I\ncan produce it immediately if your\nexcellency needs it. This time, Sumu was\nsurprised. What a coincidence. This one\nactually carried the golden eye. But the\nnext second, he changed his mind because\none pulled out a dagger and pointed it\nat his own heart. My lord, please wait a\nmoment. The golden I will be here soon.\nHowever, I'm afraid I won't be able to\nWith that, Juan took Mu Changengs soul\nout of the sheepkin bag and handed the\nbag to Su. My lord, the emblem of the\nprimordial god cult is here. After you\nhave finished consuming the golden eye\nand rested, you can go into the black\nmist to activate the emblem and contact\nthe nearest primordial cult member to\npick you up. Sumu took the sheepkin bag\nand said to one indifferently, \"I have\nalready felt your piety. Goodbye,\nheaven.\" Chapter 120. The Golden Eye.\nGoodbye, Heaven. One was so excited that\nher face turned bright red and she even\nbegan to stammer incoherently. Heaven,\ncan I really do this, your excellency?\nI'm just a high priest. Sumu frowned and\nsaid solemnly, \"One, remember this. The\nchildren of the primordial angels do not\ncare about rank, but only about the\nsincerity of your heart. As long as you\nare sincere enough, even ordinary\nbelievers can go to heaven. If you are\nnot sincere enough, even the pope can\nonly be trapped in hell.\" Juan became\nincreasingly excited and was about to\nsay something more when Sumu interrupted\nhim. Juan, I'll be waiting for you in\nheaven. In a fit of rage, one plunged\nthe dagger into his heart, then ripped\nit out with a brutal slash. A bright red\nheart, still connected to scarlet blood\nvessels, was pulled out, its end\nplunging into his gaping chest cavity.\nHis face gradually pald, but he did not\ndie, and not a single drop of blood\nflowed from his chest. My lord, please\nwait a moment while I prepare the golden\neye. Then, clutching his heart, one\ndragged his weakened body away. Watching\none walk away, Sumu turned around and\nput Mu Ching&lt;unk&gt;s myith myil alloy\ncyborg into the sheepkin bag. Then, he\nwatched one walk into the headless man's\nlair, squeezing his heart hard as he\nwalked. Blood dripped from his heart,\ndrawing long marks on the ground.\nBecause of the soundproof enclosure, the\nheadless man did not notice one's\narrival and allowed the other party to\nset up an array in the nest. After the\nblood magic circle covered the entire\nheadless man's lair, one was no longer\nhuman and had become a dried up corpse\nwith skin and bones. So much blood, Sumu\ncouldn't help but sigh. He was certain\nthat it was not a human body. In any\ncase, he had never seen a person bleed a\nton of blood. Juan knelt in the center\nof the sacrificial circle, his withered\nheart tossed aside, devoutly chanting\neerie incantations. Then he took out\nMuengs soul and the golden leaf placed\nthem in the center of the formation and\ngradually as the incantation\nintensified. A strange holy light\nsuddenly shone from the huge blood\nformation like a silver flame burning\nand the air was filled with a nauseating\nsmell of blood. The eerie blood stains\ndrawn on the ground seemed to come alive\nat this moment. Constantly twisting and\nturning and finally completely detached\nfrom the ground, transforming into\ncountless silver rune chains that soared\ninto the sky. They merged and\nintersected with those in midair,\nforming a huge chain cage that\ncompletely enveloped the headless man's\nlair. Just then, the headless men\nfinally noticed something was wrong.\nAlthough they couldn't see anything, the\nextremely eerie and evil aura made them\nfeel uneasy, and the headless men began\nto riot. But it was too late. The\nformation was already fully formed.\nWhoosh! Holy light shot into the sky,\ncovering the entire world in silver. An\nindescribable oppressive atmosphere\nfilled the air, making it difficult to\nbreathe, as if the air itself had become\nthick and heavy. Praise the primordial\nangels. Praise the messengers of God.\nThe fanatical and horse voice became\none's dying words. The fanatic roared\nout his last words, then plunged the\ndagger into his eye, fell to the ground,\nand fell silent forever. He sacrificed\neverything he had, including his soul,\njust to satisfy the appetite of the\nmessenger of God. It sounds absurd, but\nin the eyes of the fanatic, it was all\nperfectly justified. God gave birth to\nall things to nourish man, and man had\nnothing to repay God with. Now that the\nmessenger of God needed him, he\nnaturally had to give everything. Buzz,\nstrange murmurss echoed through the\nheavens and earth like millions of\nbelievers chanting praises. The headless\nfigures began to go mad, frantically\ntearing at their ears in an attempt to\nblock out the eerie murmurss, but they\nhad too many ears. From a distance, Sumu\nfelt a strange movement between his\nbrows. The silver mark there split open\nuncontrollably, revealing a silver\nvertical pupil inside. The pupil seemed\nto have its own consciousness darting\naround in its narrow socket. Through the\nsilver vertical pupils, Sumu saw a\ncolossal creature. Its body was larger\nthan this world, its outline blurred and\ndistorted, and its eight holy wings\nslowly flapped behind it. Primordial\nangels. Suddenly, the primordial angel\nin the sky moved. He opened his mouth,\nwhich was like a black hole, and the\nheadless man on the ground melted away\ninch by inch, turning into a pool of\nthick blood. The blood pulled up and\neventually turned into a river of blood.\nThe river of blood surged into the sky\nand flowed into the mouth of the\nprimordial angel. Mixed in with the\nblood river were many white figures, the\nsouls of headless men. They were\nincredibly ferocious and twisted as if\nthey had suffered great pain and were\nswept into the mouths of the primordial\nangels by the blood river. Sumu even saw\nMuengs terrified soul screaming and\nhowling wildly in the river of blood as\nwell as Juan. This fanatic was unlike\nanyone else. His face showed no fear or\npain, only pilgrimage, as if he were\nreturning to God's embrace. One seemed\nto sense Sumu&lt;unk&gt;s gaze, twisting his\nhead 180\u00b0 unnaturally. He smiled and\nwaved at Sumu, his lips moving as if he\ncouldn't make a sound. However, Sumu\ncould tell from his lip movements that\none was saying, \"My Lord, see you in\nheaven.\" After the entire river of blood\nwas devoured by the primordial angel,\nhis enormous body began to slowly fade.\nThe holy light between heaven and earth\nbegan to weaken and everything returned\nto silence. Whether it was a\nmisperception or not, Sumu felt as if\nthe primordial angel glanced at him in\nthe last moment before disappearing.\nSumu didn't care since this wasn't the\nfirst time he had been watched by a god.\nWhen the holy light completely\ndissipated, the entire headless man's\nlair was empty and desolate, except for\na dazzling golden light shining in the\ncenter of the lair. Sumu immediately\nwalked towards the direction of the\ngolden light, and saw that the original\ngolden leaf had now taken root in the\nground, sprouted, and was wrapped around\na kneeling skeleton like a gourd vine\nwith lush branches and leaves, and was\nexceptionally bright. Beneath the most\nlush golden leaves, a golden fruit\nshaped like a human eyeball gleams\nbrightly. The golden eye. Sumu reached\nout and picked the golden fruit. The\ntexture was very peculiar. It looked\nlike it was made of gold, but the\noverall feel was soft and smooth, like\nholding an eyeball. As the golden eye\nwas plucked, the golden gourd vine\nwithered instantly, along with one's\nbones, which scattered all over the\nground. Sacrificing nearly 10,000\nheadless people, plus the souls of\nsilver level experts and the high priest\nof the primordial god cult, is all it\ntakes to obtain a golden eye. It truly\ndeserves to be the main ingredient of\nthe gold level awakening potion. Sumu\nsighed slightly, noticing that the value\nof gold level experts was still rising.\nA powerhouse of this caliber would be\nconsidered a strategic weapon within the\nCrimson Flame Empire. No wonder the\ndescendants of the Gold Saints are\nnobles. For such powerful individuals,\nensuring their descendants enjoy wealth\nand luxury is as easy as turning their\nhand. At the same time, he also sensed\nthe madness of the primordial god cult\nas if anything that could be solved\nthrough sacrifice was easy in their\nmouths. Chapter 1, 21. Bronze treasure.\nSilent sound. Click. Suddenly, cracking\nsounds echoed all around. Sumu looked up\nand saw that tiny cracks had appeared in\nthe sky, and the cracks were expanding\nat a visible speed. The headless people\nhave all been sacrificed. This nightmare\nworld is about to be destroyed. Sumu had\nalready experienced this scene once\nbefore in Ting&lt;unk&gt;s nightmare, so it\nwas a familiar one for him. He knew that\nwhen the nightmare world was destroyed,\nthe nightmare apostles would return to\nthe real world. He used to think it was\nnormal, but after seeing the black mist,\ndoubts arose in his mind. Why was it a\nreturn to the real world and not the\nblack mist? Logically speaking, after\nthe bubble of the dream bursts, the\npeople inside should return to the black\nmist. Could it be that the so-called\nhell is actually just an even bigger\ndream? Only people in the real world can\nreturn to reality after the dream\nshatters, while people like Juan, who\nare dreamers to begin with, can only\nlive in the dream forever. Sumu couldn't\nfigure out the answer, nor did he want\nto know it so easily. Click, click. The\nsounds of dreams shattering grew more\nfrequent, and countless cracks appeared\nthroughout the entire world. Even the\ngiant rock that the headless leader had\npreviously occupied began to crack. At\nthis moment, Sumu's eyes narrowed.\nSomething seemed to be glowing from\nwithin the shattered boulder. Seeing\nthat the surrounding cracks were about\nto engulf him, he acted swiftly and\nscooped up the glowing object. Sumu's\nfigure appeared out of thin air amidst\nthe ruins of the Viper gang. There was\nno one around, only a cordon that had\nalready been set up along with some\nwarning signs and fences. There were\nalso signs that many people had surveyed\nthe site. Sumu didn't care. Such a huge\nexplosion by the Viper gang would\ndefinitely attract the attention of the\nentire 13th district and even Star City.\nIt was perfectly normal for the law\nenforcement bureau to seal off this\nplace. After all, almost 4 days had\npassed. faint glow under the moonlight.\nWhen he probed his mind with his\nspiritual power, countless chaotic\nsounds immediately rang in his mind.\nScreams of people, roars of various\nanimals, the sound of wind, rain,\nexplosions, and impacts. It was as if\nthe sounds of the whole world were\nringing in his mind at the same time.\nBut gradually, as the sounds grew louder\nand louder, all the sounds disappeared,\nand he could no longer hear any sound.\nAssumu withdrew his spiritual power,\nfaint traces of blood appeared in his\nears. However, there was no sign of pain\non his face. Instead, he smiled and\nsaid, \"Brondon tier three treasure,\nsilent heaven. This is a treasure\ncreated by tens of thousands of headless\npeople over an unknown period of time\nusing all kinds of sounds from around\nthe world. Its functions are quite\nsimple. First, it can imitate any sound\nwithin a 100 meter range. Second, it can\nuse sound to launch attacks. If you add\nthe storage treasures and sheep skin bag\nhe acquired earlier, he now has a total\nof three treasures. Although this battle\nwas extremely dangerous, the gains were\nnot bad. Three treasures, a myithil\nalloy cyborg, and a golden eye. The\ngolden eye in particular is priceless as\nit is a divine object that can help\nsilver level cultivators advance to gold\nlevel. Once it appears on the market,\neven nobles would fight tooth and nail\nto get their hands on it. Just then, a\nlight suddenly appeared in the distance,\nand a joyful voice rang out. Chief,\n\"That's great. I knew you would be all\nright.\" Ziao Xiao Yao ran over with a\nflashlight in hand, accompanied by a\nstern-faced man in black with a bulging\nwaist. \"How did you know I was here?\"\nSumu asked, looking at the two people\nwho were jogging over. Xiao Xiao quickly\nreplied. \"Since you disappeared, I have\ncome to check on you everyday.\" During\nthis time, people from the law\nenforcement bureau, people from the\nbronze coffin, and many strangers have\ncome one after another. They all said\nthat you were dead, but I didn't believe\nit. I thought that if you came back, you\nwould definitely need someone to take\ncare of you. So, I come to check on you\nevery day. H, that's thoughtful of you.\nSumu praised him lightly, and Xiao Xiao\ngrinned, clearly very pleased. At this\nmoment, the man in black suddenly said,\n\"Minister Sue, I am from the Bronze\nCoffin Special Forces. The boss has been\nworried about you, so he sent me to keep\nwatch here. Now that you are back, I\nwill inform the boss immediately. The\nboss mentioned by the man in black was\nnaturally Murong Munglay. Sumu did not\nstop her from making the call. His\nreturn was no secret, so there was no\nneed to hide it. Minister Su, the boss,\nis on the phone. Mungley&lt;unk&gt;s cold\nvoice immediately came through, mixed\nwith a hint of barely perceptible\nexcitement. Suzu, I knew you wouldn't\ndie so easily. Although I don't know\nwhere you've been these past few days,\nit's good that you're all right. Sumu\nsmiled slightly. Thank you for your\nconcern, Miss Mly. If it weren't for\nyour crimson heart this time, I'm afraid\nI would have had a hard time coming back\nalive. In the end, all of this is\nbecause of me. After all, they really\nwant to deal with me. If I hadn't\ninvited you to join the bronze coffin,\nnone of this would have happened. Never\nmind. Let's not talk about this now. You\nshould come to the bronze coffin right\nnow. During the days you and Much Chong\nwere missing, Chin Zaheo was furious. He\neven mobilized the silver level\nsuperhuman guarding the mythal mind to\nsearch for you. Once he finds out that\nyou have appeared, he will definitely\nnot let this go. Upon hearing this, Sumu\nMu&lt;unk&gt;s smile widened. That really\nsounds exciting. Bronze Coffin Company.\nSumu met Murong Munglay, who looked\nslightly haggarded. She still had\nexquisite makeup and impeccable taste in\nclothing. Every item she wore seemed to\nbe tailorade for her with perfect color\nmatching and style selection. However,\nthe haggardedness between her brows\ncould not be concealed by her exquisite\nmakeup. The moment Murong Mungly saw Su\nMu, the weariness between her brows\nlessened slightly, and a genuine smile\nappeared on her face. \"Welcome back,\nMinister Su of our bronze coffin.\"\nMurang Mungley slowly stood up,\nrevealing a sumptuous dinner and an\nexpensive bottle of red wine that had\nbeen prepared on the table behind her.\nShe didn't ask what Sumu had gone\nthrough during his disappearance, but\ninstead smiled and pointed to the\ndinner. You're welcome, dinner. Sumu\naccepted the invitation and took a seat.\nHe was indeed hungry. He had barely\neaten anything during his days in the\nnightmare world. Murang Mli poured Sumu\na glass of red wine, the rich red liquid\nswirling in the crystal goblet. She\npicked up her wine glass and looked at\nSumu with a smile. This first glass of\nwine is to congratulate Suzu on your\nsafe return. Bang! The crisp sound of\nglasses clinking rang out. Sumu down the\nwine in his glass in one gulp. It tasted\nsmooth but had a slightly off taste.\nChapter 1:22. Nang Gong Mongly. Would\nyou be interested in telling me about\nyour experiences over the past few days?\nOf course. Sumu smiled slightly,\ncasually telling the lie. A long pause.\nA look of surprise flashed across Murong\nMung&lt;unk&gt;s delicate face. Mu Chong was\nactually killed by you. So the weakness\nof the metal cyborg is the soul. Indeed,\nMuengs physical body is indeed\nimpeccable. But without the physical\nbarrier, he is completely unable to deal\nwith mental superhumans. And\ncoincidentally, I am a mental\nsuperhuman. Of course, Bubai also helped\nme a lot. If it weren't for it, I\nwouldn't have been able to withstand Mu\nChangs final self-destruction. U Morong\nMly chuckled. You're a naming genius. I\nnever imagined you had such a trump\ncard. Actually managing to subdue a\nnightmare monster. Indeed, no one\nexpected Mu Chong to self-destruct.\nAfter being invaded by your mental\npower, he decisively chose to\nself-destruct. If it weren't for Boo by\nShadow Space, I'm afraid I would never\nhave seen you again. Sumu shook his\nhead. It's not just that it's not white.\nYour crimson heart also played a role.\nIf it weren't for the crimson heart\nbuying me time, I probably wouldn't have\nbeen able to escape into the shadow\nspace. So, you've been recuperating in\nthe shadow space all this time? Why\nhaven't you returned to the bronze\ncoffin? No. I originally planned to\nrecuperate in the shadow space, but then\nI suddenly felt the call of the\nnightmare world. So, I went there and\njust got back. Sumu said seriously. Yes,\nhe lied. He told Muri that he had\ndefeated Mu Chong, the cyborg, with his\nmental power, concealing the fact that\nMu Chong was a silver level expert.\nThen, Mu Chong self-destructed and he\nhid in the shadow space. Later, he\njumped from the shadow space to the\nnightmare world. In his account,\neverything was false except for the\nname. Murang Mungley had no doubts. She\nseemed somewhat absent- minded, often\nstaring blankly at her wine glass. Come\non, have another drink. She picked up\nher glass again and drank it all in one\ngulp, a blush appearing on her fair and\nflawless face. Setting down the glass,\nshe gave a slightly bitter smile. This\nis probably the last time we drink\ntogether. Before Sumu could ask, Morong\nMly continued. I'm leaving. Sumu&lt;unk&gt;s\neyes flickered slightly. Leave because\nof the Mong family heads birthday in 3\ndays. Morong Mly nodded absent-mindedly.\nThat's right. There are only 3 days\nleft. I've used every resource I can,\nbut I still haven't found any clues\nabout the Golden Eye. In order not to\nmarry Shinaheo, I have no choice but to\nleave. Where are you planning to go? Mor\nMoonly shook her head. Don't ask\nanymore. I can't say. There are some\nthings that, even if you just know them,\nwill put you in great danger. Call.\nMurang Mungli took a deep breath, biting\nher delicate lips tightly. Her gaze\ntowards Su Mu held a peculiar meaning,\nas if she were somewhat reluctant to\nspeak, but she still mustered the\ncourage to say it. Suzu, there's one\nmore thing I need to do before I leave.\nI hope you won't blame me, but I really\nneed a child. So, that's your reason for\ndrugging me? Sumu calmly pushed up his\nbrown tinted glasses, his expression\ncomposed. Murong Mungley was taken\naback. You knew all along. Sumu smiled\nslightly, picked up the red wine glass\nin his hand, and swirled the deep red\nwine. Royal seller platinum premium 158.\nThe color is a deep and rich ruby red.\nThe initial aroma is complex with fruit\nand floral aromomas such as black cherry\nand violet, as well as the woody aroma\nfrom the oak barrels. But there was a\nfaint medicinal scent mixed in with the\nwine. Given Miss Mingley as status, I\ndoubt she would buy counterfeit wine.\nTherefore, there's only one answer. The\nwine is poisoned. Seeing that Sumu had\nseen through her act, Moro Mingly simply\nstopped pretending and frankly admitted,\n\"That's right. There was indeed poison\nin the wine. Once I leave, I don't know\nwhen we'll meet again. Maybe never in my\nentire life. It's hard for me to meet\nanother man like you who doesn't disgust\nme and who possesses such a strong\nspiritual talent. I need a child. At\nthis moment, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Mungly had already\nstood up and gently took off her royal\nblue coat. As the coat slipped down, a\nsilk chamisole dress was revealed\nunderneath. The slender shoulder straps\noutlined her graceful shoulder lines,\nand the exquisite chamisole design\nhighlighted her charming collarbone and\nswan-like neck. Suzu, please don't blame\nme. Without the golden eye, I can only\nplace all my hopes on the child. I,\nMungley, who had already walked up to\nSumu, suddenly became breathless. Her\nbeautiful eyes fixed on Sumu&lt;unk&gt;s palm.\nIn his palm, a dazzling golden eye was\nquietly radiating light. This This is\nMurong Moonly lost her composure. This\ndignified noble lady even began to\nstutter, staring at the golden eye in\ncomplete disbelief. Sumu smiled\nslightly. As you can see, the golden\neye. Murong Moonli suddenly raised her\nhead, her eyes flashing with shock,\nexcitement, and disbelief as she looked\nat Sumu. The figure holding the golden\neye pierced her eyes. Under the neon\nlights outside the window, the young\nman's outline seemed to be coated with a\nlayer of light. The lights softened his\ncold features, and even the ends of his\nhair were painted with a bright color,\nlike a ray of light. A ray of light that\nilluminated her gloomy life. Take it.\nSumu gently pried open Murong Mungley's\nstiff hand and placed the golden eye in\nher palm. He felt no reluctance to part\nwith the mere golden eye, for it was of\nno use to him. He was not a nobleman,\nnor did he possess any bloodline to\nawaken. As for selling directly to the\nhead of the Morong family, that was not\neven on his radar. Why would such a\npowerful noble family trade with\ncommoners? If nobles were this kind of\nbenevolent, they wouldn't be nobles. If\nthey didn't exploit people, would they\neven be considered nobles? Why buy when\nyou can just rob it? He understands the\ndarkness of human nature better than\nanyone. Perhaps the head of the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\nfamily will spend a lot of money to buy\nit at first, but what will happen after\nit becomes gold. Moreover, what Sumu\nwanted was not money, but the entire\nMong family to use Murong Mungly as a\nbase to gradually erode the entire Mong\nfamily. Feeling the touch of the man's\npalm and the coolness of the golden eye,\nMurong Mungley finally came to her\nsenses. She stared blankly at the golden\neye and sat back down in her seat,\nseemingly lost in thought. Before she\nknew it, tears had welled up in her\neyes, which reflected the neon lights.\nShe remained silent for a long time\nbefore speaking in a horse voice. Suzu,\nthank you. Sumu smiled and raised his\nglass. I also want to thank you for your\ncrimson heart. Murly wiped away the\ntears from the corners of her eyes and\nraised her wine glass as well. Consider\nit an obligation I owe you. You helped\nme, but I poisoned you. Were you\npoisoned? If so, I can't. Sumu shook his\nhead. No, but I'm quite curious. Why are\nyou so insistent on doing this? Mor\nMoonly felt as if a huge weight had\nfinally been lifted from her heart. She\nsmiled and said, \"If before it was\nbecause I wanted a child, now I admit\nI'm really tempted. Would you like to\nhear my story? I'm all ears.\" Bang. The\nstemmed crystal glasses clinkedked\ngently, producing a crisp sound. Amidst\nthe sounds, Morong Mungley began to tell\nher story. Actually, my surname isn't\nMorrow. My real surname is Nang Gong.\nNingong Mung. A hint of reminiscence\nflashed in her eyes as she spoke of this\nname. Chapter 123. Silver Law Sequence\n121. Flowers bloom in an instant. You\nmay not have heard of the surname\nNangong because it has disappeared for\nnearly several decades. And information\nabout the Nangong family has been erased\nby the royal family of the Crimson Flame\nEmpire. Nangong. Sumu had never heard of\na nobleman named Nangong. He didn't know\nmuch about nobles as they were too far\naway from the lower city. The Nangong\nfamily was once the most prestigious\nnoble family in the Crimson Flame Empire\nand the strongest person in the Crimson\nFlame Empire was also from the Nangong\nfamily. When the Crimson Flame Empire\nwent to war with other empires, the\nNangong family was highly valued by the\nroyal family. The head of the Nang Gong\nfamily at that time even killed three\ngold level experts from the enemy\ncountry on the battlefield with his own\nstrength and was extremely famous for a\ntime. But after the war ended, his\nachievements overshadowed the masters.\nMurong Moonly nodded, a hint of hatred\nappearing in her eyes. That's right.\nIt's a case of merit overshadowing the\nmaster. There's nothing new under the\nsun. Similar scenes have played out\ncountless times in history. It's just\nthat this time it's the Nangong family's\nturn. The head of the Nang Gong family\nat that time had already retired\ngracefully and handed over his military\npower after the war. But in the end, he\nwas still purged by the royal family.\nThe royal family simply cannot tolerate\na gold saint who has the ability to kill\nthem at any time. Do you remember what\nthe highest sequence of the silver law\nis? Sumu pondered for a moment, then\nslowly uttered the silver law, the\nhighest known sequence. Silver law\nsequence 121. Flower blooms in an\ninstant at the cost of lifespan alters\none's own timeline putting oneself in a\nstate of accelerated time. The Nang Gong\nfamily is the one that controls the\nflower blooms in an instant. There have\neven been instances where a silver level\nthird tier superhum from the Nangong\nfamily killed a gold level superhum. It\ncan be said that the strength of the\nNangong family is inseparable from the\nflower blooms in an instant. This is the\ncore of their entire superhuman path.\nThe other laws they possess are\nbasically all in service of the flower\nblooms in an instant. What is the golden\nlaw of the Nangong family? Sumu asked\ncuriously, since the Nang Gong family\nmembers could achieve challenges beyond\ntheir level with the flower blooms in an\ninstant technique, the golden law must\nbe even stronger. Unexpectedly,\nNangongly shook her head. I don't know.\nThe hatred on her face intensified and\nher delicate fists clenched tightly.\nWith the destruction of the Nangong\nfamily, the golden law has long been\nlost. This information was all told to\nme by my mother. My mother was a member\nof the Nangong family and the only one\nwho escaped that purge to avoid being\ntracked down by the empire. She\nsacrificed her extraordinary powers,\nbecoming an ordinary person. Later\nduring her escape, she was kidnapped by\nhuman traffickers, enslaved, and finally\nbought by the head of the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] family.\nAnd who was your father? My father was\nalso a member of the Nangong family. My\nmother was pregnant with me when she was\nfleeing. It's ridiculous that Murangua\nalways thought I was a premature baby\nand raised me for the Nangong family for\n20 years. When [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] was mentioned,\nNangong Moon&lt;unk&gt;s face showed even more\nhatred. Sumu saw through the deception,\n\"Your true purpose doesn't seem to be to\noffer the golden eye to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I would\nrather die than give the golden eye to\nthat old scoundrel Mong.\" A deep-seated\nhatred surfaced on Nang Gong\nMungley&lt;unk&gt;'s exquisite face. She\nforced my mother into marriage and\nkilled her. If it weren't for that old\nscoundrel, Morong, my mother would never\nhave died. Then what do you want the\ngolden eye for? Nang Gong Lingly calmed\nher agitated emotions slightly and\nlooked at Sumu seriously, saying, \"Suzu,\nthe moment you gave me the golden eye, I\nchose to believe you. Now that you know\nabout my background, I might as well\ntell you all my plans. Actually, I took\nthe golden eye not for that old thief\n[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] but for myself of the golden eye\nis to develop one's own bloodline. This\nthing has no effect on ordinary people,\nbut it is something that nobles dream\nof. Nobles are all descendants of golden\npowerhouses. Gold is a qualitative\nchange. After becoming a golden\ntransformer, a person's essence will\nchange and the power they possess will\nbe passed on to their descendants\nthrough bloodline. In other words, every\nnobleman has the potential to make gold.\nOf course, the premise is that one can\nperfectly develop the power contained in\nthe golden bloodline. And the golden eye\nis the divine medicine for developing\nthe golden bloodline. Otherwise, the old\nthief Muron would not have always wanted\nthe golden eye, hoping to advance to the\ngolden level with it. I sought the\ngolden eye to awaken the power of the\nNangong family s bloodline. For years,\nI've strived relentlessly, hoping to\nawaken the golden bloodline on my own,\nbut my talent is too lacking. Without\nexternal help, it's&lt;unk&gt; impossible. Now\nwith the golden eye, I can recreate the\nNang Gong family as moment of blooming\nflowers. Sumu frowned slightly. Flowers\nbloom in an instant is a silver law.\nDoes that mean you can directly advance\nto silver after consuming the golden\neye? Nangong mungly smiled slightly,\ntucking her stray hair behind her ear to\nreveal her exquisite profile. Although I\nhate nobles now, I have to admit their\nadvantages. As descendants of gold level\nexperts, nobles with gold blood flowing\nin their veins can start at silver level\none as soon as they awaken their\nbloodline. This is the foundation laid\nby their ancestors and the basis for the\nnobility's long-standing superiority\nover all others. Doesn't that sound\nunfair? But that's just how the world\nis. Some people are born with a higher\nstarting point than ordinary people. Or\nrather, the starting point for the\nnobility is the end point for ordinary\nextraordinary people to strive for their\nwhole lives. Of course, this is all\npredicated on these nobles being able to\nawaken their golden bloodline. Sumu\nswirled the red wine in his glass and\nsaid calmly, \"From a genetic point of\nview, \"This makes perfect sense. The\noffspring of highly intelligent people\nare likely to have highly intelligent\nchildren as well. Not to mention the\ndescendants of the legendary gold\nsaints. This explains it all. If the\nnobility didn't have this kind of\nfoundation, they would have been\noverthrown by their subordinates long\nago based on their past practices. After\nall, this is a world of extraordinary\nindividuals. They don't care if you're a\nnoble or not. Since the nobility hasn't\nbeen overthrown, it proves they can\nsuppress ordinary extraordinary\nindividuals. Suzu, you are indeed\nextraordinary. I have met some\nextraordinary people among ordinary\npeople. When they learn about the\nbackground of the nobles, their first\nreaction is often jealousy or anger.\nThey feel it is unfair. Why did they\nhave to risk their lives to climb to the\nsilver rank? However, nobles only need\nto awaken their bloodline to advance to\nsilver rank. They don't even need to\nseek extraordinary paths afterward. They\nonly need to follow the path their\nancestors took step by step, gradually\ndeveloping their gold bloodline to have\na chance at gold rank. Sumu remained\nnon-committal. I don't think jealousy\nand anger are absolutely negative\nemotions. In fact, in many cases, they\nare the driving force of human progress.\nAs long as we keep them in moderation\nand don't get lost in jealousy, we can\nmanage them. Chapter 124. Killing nobles\nmust be very interesting, right? It\nseems you've handled it very well, Suzu.\nI can tell you're not jealous at all,\nwhich makes me very curious. To be\nhonest, even though I'm a nobleman, I\nsometimes envy those nobles who are very\ntalented, and I envy them for being able\nto awaken their bloodline so easily. Can\nyou tell me how you did it? Nang Gong\nMungly carefully examined Sumu as if she\nwanted to understand more about the\nman's inner thoughts. Sumu smiled\nfaintly. It's very simple. I'll just\nbecome a gold saint, right? After all,\nthose high and mighty gold saints were\njust ordinary people at the beginning.\nHearing the confident and composed words\nof the man in front of her, Nangong\nMingli was inexplicably lost in thought.\nYes, even the gold level experts started\nout as ordinary people. At this moment,\nSumu said again, \"I think I understand\nwhy you are so determined to have a\nchild. If you don't find the golden eye,\nyou will choose to leave Star City and\nquietly raise the next generation of\noffspring, hoping that your child can\nawaken the golden bloodline of the\nNangong family.\" Nangly came to her\nsenses. This is exactly what I planned\nat the beginning. The revenge for the\nNang Gong family must be taken. Our\nfamily sacrificed their lives for the\nCrimson Flame Empire, but in the end, we\nwere wiped out. As the only surviving\ndescendant of an Angong family, I not\nonly want to kill the old thief [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] to\navenge my mother, but also to overthrow\nthe Crimson Flame royal family to avenge\nmy family. When talking about her\nenemies, her tone was calm, but anyone\ncould hear the determination in her\nwords. If I cannot take revenge, then I\nwill pass on the hatred to my child. I\nknow this is very unfair to the child,\nbut as a descendant of the Nangong\nfamily, this is the fate he must bear.\nthe eye, and you possess powerful\nspiritual talent, which is very helpful\nin awakening the golden bloodline of the\nNangong family. You are the best\ncandidate to be the father of my child.\nHowever, I don't need to now. With the\ngolden eye, I can take revenge myself.\nAt this point, Nangong Mungly blinked, a\ncaptivating glint in her eyes. Of\ncourse, if you want, I have no\nobjection. After all, I don't have\nanything to offer you in return right\nnow. Sumu's expression remained\ncompletely unchanged. He pushed up his\nbrown tinted glasses and said, \"More\nthan that, I'm curious about what you'll\ndo after you get the golden eye.\" \"Suzu,\ndo you know what you're doing makes me\nfeel very frustrated?\" Sumu smiled\nwithout saying a word. Nang Gong Lwingly\nhad no choice but to continue. I have\nalready collected all the other\nmaterials for the bloodline awakening\npotion except for the golden eye. Now\nthat I have the golden eye, I can awaken\nmy bloodline. The Nang Gong family's\ngolden bloodline contains three silver\nlaws. As long as the silver law I awaken\nis flower blooms in an instant. I will\nkill Muranga at the Murong family's\nbanquet in 3 days. Sumu raised an\neyebrow. He knew that Nangong Mungi\nwasn't the type to boast. Bayin e killed\nby Sananss [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in front of everyone.\nSince the other party had such\nconfidence, it was enough to prove the\npower of flowers bloom in an instant.\nWhat happens after Morongja? As far as I\nknow, killing a nobleman in the Crimson\nFlame Empire is considered a major\ncrime. Afterwards, I will join the\nRevolutionary Army. If there is anywhere\nin the Crimson Flame Empire that can\ntolerate someone who kills a noble, it\nis only the Revolutionary Army.\nRevolutionary Army? Yes, the\nRevolutionary Army. It's an organization\nestablished by a group of people\noppressed by the nobility with the goal\nof overthrowing the rule of the Crimson\nFlame Empire. Are you sure you can kill\n[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in front of everyone and get away\nunscathed? Sumu found it hard to imagine\nthat a silver level one could kill a\nsilver level three in a noble gathering\nand leave alive. If flower blooms in an\ninstant was really that powerful, it\nshouldn't be silver law but gold law.\nNangong Mung Le's face. I'm not sure,\nbut I have to kill Murangua. I've waited\nfor far too long. I have nightmares\nevery day about the day my mother died.\nIf I have the chance, I will try no\nmatter what. Sensing the determination\nhidden within the woman's delicate body,\nSumu smiled. It's been a long time since\nI've encountered something so\ninteresting. Count me in. Nangong\nMoon&lt;unk&gt;s expression changed slightly.\nThis matter has nothing to do with you.\nYou don't need to risk your life for me.\nSumu felt helpless. Miss Mingly, you're\nbeing a bit narcissistic. I just think\nit would be interesting to have the\nchance to kill an imperial nobleman.\nNangly, she scrutinized the man before\nher, trying to discern whether he was\ntelling the truth. She didn't find\nkilling Imperial nobles amusing. On the\ncontrary, it was tantamount to courting\ndeath, incurring the wrath of the entire\nempire, and potentially even mobilizing\ngold level experts. The lives of nobles\nwere paramount. That was an ironclad\nrule. If it weren't for her own sake,\nshe would find it hard to imagine that\nSumu Mu would kill Imperial nobles.\nPerhaps Sumu was afraid that she\nwouldn't agree, so he said it on\npurpose. All right, Miss Mly, wish us\nsuccess. Sumu smiled and raised his wine\nglass, a hint of excitement hidden in\nhis eyes behind his brown glasses.\nKilling an Imperial nobleman would be\nquite interesting. Bang! The delicate\ncrystal goblet rang out with a crisp\nsound, and the fate of an Imperial\nnobleman was sealed. Three days later,\nthe entire upper district suddenly\nbecame lively with lanterns and\ndecorations everywhere. Huge red banners\nwere even hung on the landmark buildings\nof major chambers of commerce filled\nwith various words of praise to\ncongratulate Muranga, the head of the\nMurong family on his 60th birthday. The\nhuge LED screen, which originally played\nadvertisements, was transformed into a\ndisplay of glamorous celebrities\noffering their blessings to Mong Bo with\nsincere smiles. The whole city seemed to\nbe celebrating a festival. People wore\ninsincere congratulatory smiles on their\nfaces. Many armed law enforcement\nofficers patrolled the streets. All the\nbeggars in the city disappeared\novernight because Master [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] was\nkind-hearted and could not bear to see\nthe poor. The influence of the nobility\nreached its peak at this moment. As the\nmost powerful nobleman in Star City,\nMorona&lt;unk&gt;s birthday celebration was so\ngrand that it was no exaggeration to say\nthat the entire upper district was\ncelebrating for him. Night fell quickly\nand the Upper East Side remained\nbrightly lit. The parking lot of the\nlargest hotel in the city center, the\nPullman Hotel, was packed with luxury\ncars, many of which were cars that\nordinary people had never seen in their\nentire lives, all gathered here like a\ncar show. One after another, glamorous\nmen and women adorned with jewels,\nstepped out of luxury cars, walked onto\na nearly 100 m long red carpet, and\nentered the Platinum Hotel. Among them\nwere celebrities, models, and even CEOs\nof major companies. At this moment, a\nwoman wearing a gorgeous rose, red\nevening gown stepped onto the red\ncarpet. Her appearance immediately stood\nout from the crowd. Her innate\naristocratic temperament and stunning\nbeauty made the entire red carpet shine.\nHer hair was piled high with a few\nstrands of flax and hair falling\nnaturally on both sides of her face. She\nwore white silk gloves and carried a\nsmall handbag. She walked with elegant\nsteps and graceful posture. Every\nmovement exuded aristocratic temperament\nand elegance like a princess who had\nstepped out of a fairy tale. Her\nappearance sparked a lot of discussion\nand some people wanted to go up and chat\nwith her, but a fat man beat them to it.\nChapter 1 25. The eve of the\nperformance. He was a fat man weighing\nover 300 lb. His expensive white suit\ncould barely contain his bulky figure.\nHis greasy face was full of smiles and\nhe was holding a bouquet of bright red\nroses. Mungly, my fiance\u00e9, you finally\narrived. I've been waiting for you for\nso long. Shien Zaheo stretched out his\ngreasy hand, seemingly wanting to take\nNang Gong Mung&lt;unk&gt;s hand, but Nang Gong\nMung only glanced at him coldly and said\nindifferently, \"Sorry, I already have\nsomeone.\" As she spoke, she reached out\nto her side, and her soft hand, gloved\nwith white silk, was quickly grasped by\na long, strong hand. Suddenly, a young\nman in a sharp black suit carrying a\nsnakes-kin cane, walked over. He gently\ntook Nang Gong Mungly as hand and smiled\nwarmly, saying, \"Excuse me, may I pass\nby?\" After saying that, Sumu led Nangong\nMungly past Chenzah and walked step by\nstep toward the Platinum Hotel. From\nbeginning to end, neither of them\nglanced at Shianzah. Shien Zahei&lt;unk&gt;s\nface darkened suddenly when he felt\nignored. Sumu, the deep voice was mixed\nwith the sound of clenching teeth. Damn\nbastards. He naturally knew that Su Mu\nhad returned alive, but Mu Chong had\ndisappeared. The implications of this\nwere self-evident. Over the past few\ndays, Shenzah had thought it over and\nover again, but ultimately decided not\nto make any rash moves. Others may not\nknow Mu Changengs strength, but he knows\nit perfectly well. Mu Chong is not only\na silver rank expert, but also a\ncompletely modified human. He can even\nfight against some high-ranking silver\nrank experts. But in the end, he died at\nSumu Mu&lt;unk&gt;s hands. Before he has fully\ngrasped Su Mu's strength, he cannot send\nhis two remaining silver rank experts\nout to their deaths one by one. Even a\nlion will fight a rabbit with all its\nmight. He plans to spend a lot of money\nto hire another silver level expert\nafter this banquet. When the three\nsilver level experts attack together,\nSumu will surely die. Forget it. You\nlowly commoner won't be able to cause\ntrouble for long. Once I marry Mungly\nand become a nobleman, my wealth and\npower will rise to a new level, and that\nwill be your death day.\" Shien Zaheo\nsilently pondered, then put on a fake\nsmile again and greeted the people\naround him warmly. Of the platinum hotel\nis a huge banquet hall. When Su Mu and\nNang Gong Mungly walked into the hall,\nthe waiter who had been waiting at the\ndoor slowly pushed open the door and\nbowed, saying, \"Welcome, distinguished\nguests.\" As the two stepped into the\nbanquet hall, it was as if they had\nentered a fairy tale world. Dazzling\ncrystal chandeliers hung from the high\nceiling, shining like stars and casting\na bright and soft light. The floor was\ncovered with a gorgeous carpet with\nexquisite patterns and a comfortable\nfeel underfoot. The hall is surrounded\nby tall pillars carved with exquisite\npatterns and huge oil paintings hang\nbetween the pillars. It is unknown which\nfamous artist created them adding an\nartistic touch to the place. Nearly a\n100 people had arrived in the banquet\nhall but it did not feel crowded at all.\nOn the contrary, it was rather spacious.\nNeatly dressed waiters carried trays and\nmoved among the guests serving them\nsnacks and wine. People chatted in small\ngroups, each with a warm smile on their\nface. The volume of their conversations\nwas just right, lively, but not chaotic.\nThe melodious piano music flowed gently\nthrough the banquet hall like a clear\nspring, nourishing people's souls and\nmaking them feel as if they were in a\nfairy tale banquet for a princess and\nprince. Are you really sure? Nang Mungly\nsmiled and nodded to the passing guests,\nher lips moving slightly as she asked\nSumu beside her. Sumu wore a calm and\nelegant smile as if he were the\nprotagonist of the banquet, blending in\nseamlessly without appearing out of\nplace. I certainly wouldn't want to miss\nsuch an interesting banquet. A complex\nlook flashed in Nang Gong Mong&lt;unk&gt;s\neyes. She wanted to say something more,\nbut Sumu pulled her aside. Two glasses\nof red wine, please. The waiter smiled\npolitely and respectfully handed over\ntwo glasses of red wine without being\nobsequious before slowly retreating to\nfind the next guest who needed service.\nglass to Nang Gong Mungly and then\nskillfully led her to the sofa in the\ncorner. My preparations are complete.\nNow it's up to you to see if your\nabilities are as powerful as the legends\nsay. A look of worry appeared on Nang\nGong Mung Le's face, but she ultimately\ndid not try to persuade her further. I\nwon't joke with my own life. What were\nyou preparing for when you disappeared\nfor half a day? Sumu smiled\nmysteriously. A grand performance\nnaturally requires behind-the-scenes\nwork. You'll find out soon enough.\nEverything is proceeding according to\nplan. A day ago, Nangong Moonly\nsuccessfully awakened the golden\nbloodline of the Nangong family with the\nhelp of the golden eye. And she obtained\nthe silver law flower blooms in an\ninstant, which is the highest known\nsequence ranking. According to her, the\nflower blooms in an instant skill is\nextremely difficult to awaken. It is\nonly thanks to the powerful effect of\nthe golden eye that it can be achieved\nin one step. Otherwise, even when the\nNang Gong family still existed, apart\nfrom a very few exceptionally talented\nclansmen who started by awakening the\nflower blooms in an instant skill, the\nrest of the clansmen all had two other\nsilver laws contained in their\nbloodline. After that, Nangong Mungly\nhad a conversation with Sumu. Her\noriginal plan was to tell Murang Zhua at\nthe banquet that she had obtained the\ngolden eye and when offering the golden\neye to activate flower blooms in an\ninstant to put herself into a state of\ntime acceleration and then launch a\nsurprise attack to kill Mura. The plan\nwas simple and straightforward but\nundeniably effective. None of the guests\npresent, including Muronga, would have\nimagined that the illegitimate daughter\nwho had always been disliked was\nactually a descendant of the Nangong\nfamily, let alone that she had awakened\nthe strongest silver law. With a\nwell-intentioned but unprepared attack,\nSilver 3 was destined to die on the\nspot. Moreover, Morona's silver laws are\nall offensive and have no defensive\ncapabilities. A fatal wound to any of\nthem is certain death. As Murangja's\nadopted daughter, Nangong Mly revealed\nall of his secrets early on. Murangja's\nthree silver laws are eye of the storm,\nspeed of the wind shadow, and wind dance\nspirit blade. These three silver laws\ngrant him great mobility and lethality,\nbut lack any defensive capabilities.\nTherefore, for Nangong Monglay, killing\nMoronga with the flower blooms in an\ninstant, technique is not difficult. The\nreal challenge lies in how to leave\nalive. While the time acceleration of\nthe flower blooms in an instant\ntechnique is powerful, it has two fatal\ndrawbacks. First, it requires burning\none's lifespan to accelerate one's own\ntimeline. Second, once in the time\nacceleration state, the body will be\nunder immense pressure and cannot\nmaintain this state for long. These two\nmajor drawbacks mean that Nang Gong\nMunley has no ability to fight\ncontinuously. In addition, she has only\nrecently awakened, so she can be said to\nbe a fragile assassin. She can kill with\none hit, but after killing, she can only\nwait to die on the spot, unless she\nrecklessly enters the time acceleration\nstate again and escapes the scene. The\nproblem is that having killed an\nImperial nobleman in full view of\neveryone, Nangong Mungly, now in a state\nof extreme weakness, could not possibly\nescape the scene, let alone Star City.\nChapter 1, 126. Morungha Nangong Mingli\nas plan was a gamble, betting that she\nwould be lucky enough and that her body\nwould be able to support her escape.\nSumu rejected her plan and proposed a\nbetter one. The two men and women who\nwere preparing to kill the Imperial\nnobles calmly chatted while holding wine\nglasses, occasionally discussing\ninteresting things happening in Star\nCity. No one could tell that such crazy\nideas were hidden beneath their composed\nand elegant exteriors. Suzu, do you know\nthat Yong Donging has been looking for\nyou a lot while you were gone? Although\nhe keeps saying that it would be better\nif he died and that he would get himself\nkilled sooner or later. He is very\nconcerned about your whereabouts. He\nmust have come to see you in a few days\nsince you came back, right? Nang Gong\nLingly seemed to recall Yong\nDonging&lt;unk&gt;s awkward expression, a\nfaint smile appearing on her lips. Sumu\nnodded. I looked for him. He said\nsomething about good people not living\nlong, but bad people live a long life.\nHe knew I definitely wouldn't die, so he\ntook an advance on next month's salary\nand left. Nangong Lingly couldn't help\nbut laugh. He also asked me for an\nadvance on his salary, saying he was\ngoing to buy clothes for his girlfriend.\nI really don't know how many clothes\nhe's going to buy. Sumu shrugged. This\nkid says he's buying clothes to\napologize, but I bet he has ulterior\nmotives. Oh, what intentions do you\nhave? Nangong Moonly leaned closer, her\neyes smiling. Sumu didn't answer such an\nobvious question. With Yong Doning&lt;unk&gt;s\nbrain, what could he possibly be up to?\nHe probably just saw that the clothes in\nthe upper city were glamorous and sexy\nand planned to dress Jasmine in them\nbefore launching a surprise attack on\nthe upper city that night. As the two\nchatted and laughed on the other side of\nthe banquet, Shien Zahe&lt;unk&gt;s eyes were\npractically spitting fire. He stared\nintently at Su Mu and Nan Gong Mingly,\nunable to suppress the jealousy and\nanger in his heart. Damn you two. Just\nwait. After tonight, you'll be\ncompletely mine. Damn it. Why isn't that\nold bastard Morunga here yet? The\nbanquet starts in half an hour. Hurry up\nand come here to announce the\nengagement. Perhaps Chian Zahe&lt;unk&gt;s\ncurses had an effect because the main\ncharacter of the banquet, Mongu, the\nhead of the Mong family, finally\nappeared. When he appeared, the once\nbustling banquet hall was instantly put\non pause. Everyone stopped talking and\nlooked at the old man at the entrance.\nHe was dressed in a dark, luxurious robe\nmade of exquisite fabric with delicate\nembroidery outlining ancient patterns.\nHis silver hair was neatly combed and\nslightly swept back, revealing a\nslightly furrowed forehead. His eyes\nwere deep like unfathomable lake water,\nand his lips were tightly pursed,\nexuding an air of authority without\nanger. Beside him were two men and a\nwoman, all with an extraordinary air\nabout them. They were Mongju&lt;unk&gt;s three\nchildren who escorted him as he\ngracefully entered the hall. Greetings,\nPatriarch Mong. It's been a long time.\nPatriarch Mong is still as energetic as\never. A group of people rushed forward,\ngreeting him with all their might, not\nasking for anything else but to become\nacquainted with him. As the most\npowerful nobleman in Shingqing and a\nsilver level three transcendent being,\nMongu held an extremely prestigious\nposition. It is no exaggeration to say\nthat Shingqing was his personal thief.\nHowever, Morungju was seemed to be in a\nbad mood today. Despite the enthusiasm\nof the crowd, he kept his brows furrowed\nand only nodded preuncterally. The\nguests also knew when to stop, and none\nof them dared to provoke trouble. Why\nwas [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in a bad mood? It wasn't a\nsecret in the upper city circle. It was\nsimply because of the golden eye.\nWithout the golden eye, he couldn't\nbreak through to the golden realm. In\naddition, he was too eager for success\nwhen he was young and abused\nextraordinary drugs, which caused his\nbody to be severely depleted and his\nlife was coming to an end. No one would\nbe in a good mood under such\ncircumstances. Soon, Morongja&lt;unk&gt;s\nthree children were surrounded by a\ncrowd. Their thinking was simple. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\nwas doomed sooner or later, so they\nnaturally had to intensify their efforts\nto win over the children who might\nbecome his heirs. Among them, the eldest\nson, Murong Yun, was surrounded by the\nmost people. With Murong Zha's arrival,\nthe atmosphere of the banquet reached a\nclimax. The guests became even more\nenthusiastic, and the pianist changed\nthe program to a cheerful piece.\nGradually, men and women began to dance\nin the center of the dance floor, and\ncelebrities even sang songs. People\ntoasted each other and took turns\nwishing [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] a happy birthday. In\ncontrast, Nang Gong Mung&lt;unk&gt;s place was\nvery deserted, as if she had been\nabandoned by the world. Everyone knew\nthat Murangua disliked this illegitimate\ndaughter, and apart from a few people at\nthe bottom of the banquet who were\ntrying their luck, almost no one came to\nfind Nang Gong Mly. At this moment, Shin\nZaheo couldn't sit still any longer. The\nbanquet was already halfway through, but\nMurang Laang still hadn't shown any\nintention of speaking. He just sat there\nfrowning. He couldn't stand it anymore,\nso he stood up, dragged his fat body,\nand walked over to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with his wine\nglass. Uncle, your nephew Chiian Zahi\nwishes you a long and healthy life, and\nthat you enjoy the happiness of family\nforever. Shien Zahe&lt;unk&gt;s voice was loud\nand clear, and his face was full of\nsmiles, which immediately caught\nMorongjha&lt;unk&gt;s attention. Morona looked\nup at the fat man in front of him,\nfrowned slightly, and seemed somewhat\ndispleased. At this moment, Shin Zaheo\nhurriedly said, \"To celebrate your\nbirthday, I would like to offer you a\nMyithil mine in the west of the city.\nPlease accept it, uncle.\" Upon hearing\nthis, gasps of surprise erupted from all\naround. A gift of Mithil or what a grand\ngesture. The birthday gifts they\nprepared to please Moroa were naturally\nvery valuable. But even the most\nvaluable items pald in comparison to\nMithril ore. Some people who knew the\ninside story were secretly shocked.\nAlthough the output of the myithil mine\nin the west of the city was very low, it\nwas still a mythil mine which was\nextremely valuable. Shenzah really went\nto great lengths to marry Murong Mly.\nMyithil mine Mongo's brows relaxed. The\nold nobleman showed no surprise on his\nface, but instead remained calm. You are\nvery kind, my nephew. Shenzah&lt;unk&gt;s\nsmile widened, but inwardly he was\ncursing. Old Bay is pretending to be\nsomething he has not. Damn it. If it\nweren't for my noble status in Ming Lee,\nwould I have gone to such lengths? He\nagreed in private, but he had to make me\nsay it in public. At this moment,\nMorongju was slowly stood up, and his\neldest son, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Yun, quickly handed\nhim a cup of wine. Morungja raised his\nwine glass, and all the guests present\nwisely fell silent, waiting for him to\nspeak. Thank you all for attending my\nbirthday banquet. Today, with so many\ndistinguished guests and friends\ngathered here, it is truly a great joy\nin life. Although I am now in my\ntwilight years, seeing this lively scene\nfills my heart with warmth. Mongja\nlaunched into a long speech,\ndemonstrating his expertise in such\nsituations. The guests listened\nattentively with smiles on their faces,\neach behaving with impeccable\npoliteness. Shenzah&lt;unk&gt;s hand holding\nthe wine glass was almost stiff, and the\nfake smile on his face became more and\nmore fake. Damn old Biden, he can really\ntalk nonsense. He had a long face\nbefore, but now he's talking about the\nspirit of Mithil Mine. Chapter 127, the\nshow begins. Today, on the occasion of\nhis birthday banquet, I would like to\ntake this opportunity to chat with you\nall about everyday life and share our\ndeepest feelings. I wish you all good\nhealth, harmonious families, and\nsuccessful careers. I also hope that our\nfriendship will be like this fine wine,\ngrowing more mellow and ever new with\nage. Come, gentlemen, let us drink to\nthis cup. Amidst a chorus of praise,\neveryone raised their glasses in a\ntoast, beaming with joy. Shi and Zaheo\ndown the drink in one gulp, cursing\ninwardly with increasing gusto. Old\nBang, are you going to take the\npost-graduate entrance exam? Your talk\nis like an old Sao wearing a bra. One\nthing after another. Why don't you just\nannounce the engagement already?\nGentlemen, besides my birthday, there is\nanother joyous occasion to announce\ntoday. Morunga finally got to the point\nunder Chin Zeo&lt;unk&gt;'s excited gaze.\nMorongja paused, his imposing gaze\nslowly sweeping across the room before\nfinally landing on Nang Gong Mungly in\nthe corner. When he noticed Sumu beside\nNang Gong Mung, a hint of coldness\nflashed in his eyes. Sumu smiled\nslightly. The show is about to begin.\nMungly, come here. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] was said\ncalmly. Nangong Mung slowly rose, her\ndelicate face displaying a composed\ndemeanor. She walked gracefully towards\nthe center, instantly drawing all eyes\nto her. She seemed born to be the center\nof attention, showing no discomfort\nwhatsoever in this setting. The piano\nmusic in the room suddenly became more\nintense as if foreshadowing something.\nMy daughter Mley has reached\nmarriageable age. When Muranga saw\nNangong Mungley coming over, he was\nabout to announce her engagement to Chin\nZaheo. But before he could finish\nspeaking, a clear and cold female voice\nsuddenly rang out. Mungly wishes her\nfather a happy birthday. Upon hearing\nthis, everyone was taken aback and the\natmosphere in the room became slightly\nstrange. Morona was about to announce\nthe good news. So, what did you mean by\ninterrupting him suddenly? Such rude\nbehavior, especially in front of\neveryone, was quite intriguing. As\nexpected, Murangja&lt;unk&gt;s expression\ngradually turned cold, and his imposing\ngaze fell on Nangong Mungly, his deep\neyes making it impossible to guess his\nemotions. His three children behind him\nlooked on with expressions of\nanticipation, clearly eager to see what\nwould happen to their brother next.\nNangong Mingly seemed oblivious to\nMongu's gaze and continued speaking.\nMungley has specially prepared a\nbirthday gift for you. What birthday\ngift is so important? Can't you see your\nfather is speaking? You may step back\nand we'll talk later. Mongju&lt;unk&gt;s calm\nvoice interrupted Nang Gong Mly s words.\nThose who knew him well knew that this\nold nobleman was already on the verge of\nanger. However, Nang Gong Mung did not\nleave. Instead, she took out a small\nmahogany box from her handbag. Father,\nthis birthday gift is too precious to\nwait even a moment longer. The crowd\nerupted in uproar. They all thought Nang\nGong Mungly had gone mad, openly defying\nthe head of the Morong family, and she\nwas just an illegitimate daughter. In\nthis situation, even if the eldest son,\nMong Yun, dared to do such a thing, he\nwould be severely punished. After all,\nnobles are the group in the world that\ncares most about status and dignity.\nMoronja&lt;unk&gt;s face darkened completely.\nIt seems that I have spoiled you too\nmuch in the past to the point that you\nhe paused suddenly as if he had thought\nof something and a look of excitement\nsuddenly appeared in his eyes. He\nconsidered himself to know his\nillegitimate daughter fairly well. She\nwas usually low-key cautious and never\ndared to contradict him, let alone in\npublic. Could her unusual behavior today\nbe? Is your birthday gift? Nangong\nMoonly nodded. That's right. It is\nindeed the golden eye. What? Shin Zahi\nwas the first to exclaim, his face full\nof disbelief. The three children of the\nMong family also changed color at this\nmoment, as if the words golden eye had\nsome magical power. Mongju&lt;unk&gt;s\ndignified demeanor crumbled completely,\nand his aged heart began to race.\nNangong Mungly smiled slightly and in\nfront of everyone opened the mahogany\nbox in her hand. Suddenly, a dazzling\ngolden light flashed. A golden bead\nresembling a human eyeball lay quietly\nin the box. The golden eye. It really is\nthe golden eye, exactly the same as\ndescribed in the ancient books. Mange's\nvoice trembled slightly. He was so\nexcited that he could hardly contain\nhimself, and his entire mind was drawn\nto the golden eye. Not only him, but\neveryone else did, too. Everyone looked\nat the golden eye with a strong sense of\ngreed. These people from high society\nnaturally knew the value of the golden\neye. Compared to it, the myithal mind\nwas nothing. This is a rare item that\ncan create a golden realm expert. Shown\nwith a crystal blue light hidden behind\nhis brown glasses. Mly, my good\ndaughter. Haha. Of all my children, you\nare the one I value the most. Quickly,\nquickly, give me the golden eye. When\nthe thing he had longed for for many\nyears appeared before him, even this old\nnobleman could not help but lose his\ncomposure. Although he said that, his\nhands were faster than his words. He\ntook two quick steps and reached out to\ngrab the golden eye. But at that moment,\nsomething unexpected happened. Whoosh!\nJust as Mura was about to obtain the\ngolden eye, the bright lights in the\nentire banquet hall went out instantly,\nand silent darkness enveloped the whole\nplace. Click! The sound of the huge\ncrystal chandelier hitting the ground\nechoed throughout the venue. \"Ah!\" A\nwoman in the crowd let out a piercing\nscream. Har. The golden eye. The golden\neye. Monga laughed wildly in the\ndarkness. He was so excited that he\ndidn't care about the lights suddenly\ngoing out. He cared about the golden eye\nin his hand. As long as he got his hands\non it, he could ignore even if the\nentire Platinum Hotel exploded. H a low\nmocking laugh rang out at that moment.\nThe laugh was not loud, but it seemed to\nbe heard clearly in everyone's ears.\nMorona, thank you for your selfless\ndedication. I gladly accept the golden\neye. As soon as he finished speaking,\nthe lights in the banquet hall suddenly\nturned on, and the blinding light made\neveryone squint. But when they saw the\nscene clearly, their expressions\nchanged. There was a person in the room\nout of nowhere. There stood a man in a\ntuxedo amidst the shattered crystals\nscattered on the ground. The dazzling\ncrystals shimmerred with a dreamlike\nluster under the lights, as if they were\na crystal carpet laid out for him. He\nwas tall and upright, like a pine tree,\nexuding an innate noble air. Chapter\n128. Friendly reminder. This road is\nblocked. His black tuxedo was perfectly\ntailored to fit his body, outlining his\nslender figure. He wore a black top hat\nand white gloves as if he had never been\ntouched by the dust of the world. What\nis most striking is the silver white\nmask on his face. The mask is an\narrogant smiling face slightly upturned\nwith a hint of disdain, mocking everyone\nequally. The eye area is hollowed out,\nrevealing a pair of deep and mysterious\neyes. The arrogance in the eyes is\nexactly the same as the smile on the\nsilver white mask, making people dare\nnot look directly at him. Upon seeing\nthis man, these high society guests even\nhad the illusion that the man before\nthem was the true aristocrat, while they\nthemselves were merely monkeys in a\ncrown. Where is my golden eye? Muranga's\nfurious voice reverberated throughout\nthe entire venue. Veins bulged on his\naged face and his eyes revealed\nunimaginable rage. Only then did\neveryone realize that what Murunga was\nholding was not the golden eye at all,\nbut a bright green grape. Suddenly, a\ndazzling golden light appeared in the\nmasked man's hand, and a bright golden\neyeball lay quietly on the white glove.\nBeneath the silver white smiling mask\ncame a slow, deliberate voice. Wrong.\nIt's mine. You're courting death. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\nroared, and the air in front of him\nsuddenly distorted. A highly compressed\nblade of wind shot out, carrying\ncountless tiny white streams of air and\nattacked the masked man. Silverlaw wine\ndance blade. Whoosh! The masked man's\nbody was torn apart by the wind blades.\nThe terrifying wind blades continued to\npierce through the wall and glass behind\nhim, leaving a smooth crack in the wall.\nBecause this is a high-rise building,\nwhen the wall cracked, the cold air from\nhigh above immediately rushed into the\nbanquet hall, bringing a slight chill.\nJust when everyone thought the masked\nman was dead, they saw that there was no\nblood flowing from his broken body.\nInstead, his body began to fade,\neventually becoming completely\ntransparent and disappearing. What?\nMongju&lt;unk&gt;s face was unusually gloomy.\nHis hawk-like eyes scanning his\nsurroundings. He would never allow the\ngolden eye to be taken away by anyone.\nMorongja's women and Chen Zaheo all had\ndifferent thoughts. When they saw\nsomeone snatch the golden eye, they were\nactually relieved because none of them\nwanted Morona to get the golden eye.\nShinzah&lt;unk&gt;s problem stemmed from the\nmarriage agreement. While his children's\nproblem arose from the issue of\nsuccession, in particular, the eldest\nson, Morong Yun, was the one who most\nwanted [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] to die quickly. Without the\ngolden eye, Mongja wouldn't live for\nmore than a few years, and then he would\nbe the rightful heir. At that moment,\nthe sharp-eyed Morong was suddenly\nnoticed a dark shadow flash past the\nwindow outside. His eyes flashed with a\ncold light, trying to escape. Whoosh! A\ngust of wind suddenly erupted from his\nbody, his magnificent robes fluttering\nin the wind, and he seemed to transform\ninto the wind, disappearing from the\nspot. Explosion rang out in the air, and\nthe exquisite desserts at the banquet,\nas well as some of the nearby guests,\nwere overturned to the ground by the\nstrong wind. Bang! The window shattered\nsuddenly and the figure as swift as the\nwind plunged head first out of the\nwindow and this was the 68th floor. The\nsilver law speed of wind grants Murong\nJewel whirlwindlike speed even allowing\nhim to briefly fly on the wind. The\nheight of 68 floors is as easy for him\nas walking on flat ground. Murang would\ndisappeared from everyone's sight and\nthe guests looked at each other in\ndisbelief. No one expected that such a\nthing would happen at a banquet. At this\nmoment, the eldest son of the Murong\nfamily, Murang Yun, stepped forward. As\nthe eldest son of the Murong family, he\nhad to step forward to take charge of\nthe situation, both morally and\nlogically. Gentlemen, this time, as soon\nas he opened his mouth, screams suddenly\nerupted from the crowd. Mong Yun frowned\nand looked at the screaming people in\nthe crowd, only to find that their eyes\nwere all filled with terror as they\nstared at him intently. A soft laugh\nsounded behind him. Murong Yun&lt;unk&gt;s\npupils suddenly contracted and his scalp\ntingled when he barely hesitated before\nactivating wine shadow speed and\nspeeding away. After creating some\ndistance, he noticed that a man wearing\na silver mask was standing there staring\nat him with great interest. That\narrogant gaze both shocked and enraged\nMurong Yun. Without exchanging a single\nword, he immediately unleashed the wind\ndance spirit blade. As the eldest son of\nthe Murong family, he possessed top tier\ntalent and resources and had already\nrisen to the ranks of silver too. Aside\nfrom the Murong family's strongest\ntechnique, Eye of the Storm, which he\nhadn't yet mastered, he believed his\nother two silver laws were no worse than\nMurungas. But he quickly realized the\ndifference in strength. The highly\ncompressed wind blades carrying the\npower to tear everything apart attacked\nthe masked man. But the next second, the\nmasked man's figure disappeared like a\nghost. Mong Yun was shocked. He hadn't\nexpected the other party to be faster\nthan him. He hadn't even seen the other\nparty's movement trajectory. At that\nmoment, the same light laughter rang out\nagain behind Murong Yun. You can't even\ntouch the hem of my clothes. It seems\nyou are far inferior to your father.\nWhoosh! As if reacting to an emergency,\nMurong Yun fiercely hurled a windb blade\nbehind her. But the result was she\nmissed the masked man and the windb\nblade instead smashed into the crowd.\nAh! Several screams and shrieks echoed\nthroughout the venue. Five well-dressed\nguests were cleaved in two by the wind\nblades, their blood and intestines\nspilling out onto the ground. Most of\nthese guests were ordinary people. The\nextraordinary individuals were\nultimately a minority. The crowd erupted\nin chaos. This group of high society\nmembers completely shed their elegant\nand noble facades, terrified and running\nfrantically toward the gate. Among them\nwas Chin Zaheo. Shien Zaheo valued his\nlife very much. He never imagined that\nthere would be anyone in the world who\nwould dare to cause trouble at a noble\nbanquet. He should have brought\nbodyguards with him. This masked man\neven fooled the head of the Morong\nfamily. So, he must be at least a silver\nthree expert. If such a powerful figure\nwere to start a war, the entire Platinum\nHotel would collapse. He has more money\nthan he can spend, and he doesn't want\nto die here. But the next second, a man\ndressed in a tuxedo and wearing a silver\nwhite smiling mask reappeared. He stood\non the high platform like the host of\nthe banquet, and his cold and arrogant\nsmile on the mask came into everyone's\nview. He said calmly to the crowd trying\nto escape. Friendly reminder, this road\nis blocked. But the terrified crowd\nwouldn't listen to his advice. A\nmiddle-aged man closest to the door\nfrantically pushed it open, revealing a\ndark and silent corridor without a\nsingle light. He rushed into the\ndarkness like a mad man. But the moment\nhe took his first step out the door.\nThud. Chapter 129. Whoever touches dies.\nThe middle-aged man collapsed to the\nground, clutching his neck tightly with\nboth hands, veins bulging on his face,\nhis expression ferocious, and his legs\ntwitching uncontrollably. The sudden\nturn of events startled everyone,\ncausing them to pause in their tracks.\nHowever, some people having rushed\nforward too quickly were unable to stop\nand ended up outside the gate. Without\nexception, everyone who stepped out of\nthe gate instantly collapsed to the\nground as if controlled by an invisible\nhand, tightly gripping their own necks\nand convulsing violently. Upon seeing\nthis, Chin Zahe&lt;unk&gt;s expression changed\ndrastically, and he break repeatedly.\nHowever, once his massive body started\nmoving, the inertia he carried made it\nimpossible for him to stop instantly. At\nthis moment, the silver ring on his\nlarge finger flashed with a subtle\nluster, and his figure seemed to shrink\nslightly. His legs seemed to be rooted\nto the ground, and he came to a steady\nstop. Call. He was panting heavily, and\nhis fat face was already starting to\nooze oil. The first few people to step\nout the door struggled a couple of times\nbefore falling completely silent.\nSilence. The crowd fell into dead\nsilence. As we all know, people cannot\nmake a sound when they are in extreme\nfear. Sometimes screaming is more like a\nway to vent fear. But when fear spreads\nlike a tide and fills the mouth and\nnose, people feel a blockage in their\nthroat and cannot make any sound. The\nonly thing playing in the entire banquet\nhall was the piano music that never\nstopped from beginning to end. No one\nknew why the pianist was so dedicated,\nstill playing even in this state. And\nthe more he played, the more fitting the\natmosphere became, and the piano music\nalso became low and somber, accompanied\nby the almost stagnant and oppressive\natmosphere in the room. But at this\npoint, no one paid any attention to the\npianist. The stiffness brought on by\nfear spread throughout the body. No one\ncould have imagined that the masked\nman's methods would be so bizarre,\nkilling people from a distance. Slap,\nslap. The masked man on the stage\nclapped his hands. Gentlemen, the night\nis long, and I expect Morona won't be\nback for a while. In the meantime, how\nabout we play a game? Everyone stared at\nthe masked man with fear in their eyes,\nand no one dared to make a sound. Even\nthe extraordinary individuals like\nMurong Yun were extremely wary. His\nghostly speed and bizarre killing\nmethods had easily toyed with even the\nstrongest member of the Mong family.\nWith such a powerful figure in front of\nthem, who would dare to make a rash\nmove? In the crowd, Sumu and Nangong\nLungly were still acting. Sumu had a\nperfectly measured fear on his face, and\nhis body trembled slightly as he tried\nhis best to act like everyone else. Nang\nLungly was filled with anger, shock, and\nfear as if she had not yet accepted that\nthe golden eye had been snatched away\nright before her eyes. The two actors, a\nman and a woman with superb acting\nskills, supported each other and like\neveryone else, gazed at the masked man\nhigh above them as if they were sinners\nawaiting divine judgment. How did you do\nthat? Nangongly s red lips approached Su\nMu&lt;unk&gt;s ear, her soft voice accompanied\nby a hint of warmth. She was really\ncurious. She knew the masked man was an\nillusion created by Sumu. But what about\nthe voice? And how did the person at the\ngate die? Is it possible to achieve this\nlevel of skill using only illusion\nmagic? Sumu was terrified and continued\nto tremble. He didn't answer. He didn't\nthink it was a good time to explain.\nOnly he himself knew the real answer.\nThe masked man was indeed an illusion he\ncreated using the all things in the\nworld technique. And the voice was\nsimulated using the treasure silent\nheaven. As for the sudden power outage\nand the death of those who stepped out\nof the door, these were all actors he\nhad arranged in advance. Before the\nbanquet began, he disguised himself as a\nwaiter and entered the banquet early,\nrandomly selecting a group of lucky\naudience members to be hypnotized. In\nother words, half of the people at the\nbanquet were his people. He only needed\nto have his own people stand near the\ndoor in advance. Then the first few\nwould run out the door, and he could use\nhypnosis to make them strangle him. With\nhis current mental strength, hypnotizing\nordinary people into committing suicide\nwould be a piece of cake. The group of\nextraordinary individuals led by Murong\nYun. If the masked man only dodged and\ndid not make a move from beginning to\nend, someone would soon realize that\nsomething was wrong. Therefore, for the\nsake of this grand performance, deaths\nwere necessary. Most importantly, the\ncore objective this time is to kill\n[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] However, if he only kills Morona,\nhis intentions would be too obvious.\nTherefore, he chose to make a big fuss\nas much as possible because the bigger\nthe fuss, the less likely it is to be\nguessed his true intentions. changed to\na more upbeat piece. The masked man\ninstructed the pianist beside him. The\npianist, like a puppet being\nmanipulated, immediately changed the\ntune, and the music began to play. The\nheavy notes were pressed down hard,\nsurging, and powerful like a tidal wave.\nThe melody was sometimes like a storm,\nsometimes like a stampede of horses.\nEvery strike of the keys seemed to hit\nthe hearts of everyone present. While\nthe masked man was selecting a song,\nMong Yin suddenly gave a wink to the\nextraordinary individuals beside him.\nThey nodded solemnly and quietly\nsurrounded the masked man. Suddenly, the\nmasked man turned around, startling the\ngroup into stopping immediately. He\ncompletely ignored the several\nsuperhumans who were quietly approaching\nand said to the panicked crowd with\ngreat interest. Now the game begins. The\nname of this game is whoever moves dies.\nHis slow, deliberate voice carried no\nsharpness. Yet to the ears of the\nonlookers, it sounded like a devil's\ndeath. Owl. Damn it. Morong Yun cursed\ninwardly. He never expected that the\nMong family's home turf would be\ncontrolled by a mysterious person. He\nknew he had to take action. Otherwise,\nhow could the Morong family ever hold\ntheir heads high again? Just as he was\nabout to give the order to act, a man in\na suit and leather shoes with heavy\nfoundation on his face trembled as if he\nwere terrified. You moved. A mocking\nvoice came from beneath the silver mask,\nand everyone tensed up instantly,\nwatching the masked man's next move. The\nmasked man slowly raised his right hand,\nwhich was covered by a white glove and\nclenched into a gun shape. Bang! The\nmasked man mimicked the sound of a\ngunshot as if he were playing a prank.\nBut strangely, at the moment the gun\nwent off, even though no bullet was\nfired, the man with the heavy makeup let\nout a shrill scream, clutched his chest,\nand collapsed to the ground. His face\nwas contorted with fear, and he lay\nstiffly on the ground, lifeless. Such a\nbizarre scene frightened Murong Yun so\nmuch that he dared not make a move. His\neyes widened in disbelief and his heart\nwas filled with turmoil. What kind of\nmethod is this? How can someone kill\nsomeone from a distance without bullets?\nIs there any known law about this? As\nthe man died, the people around him\ncould no longer withstand the pressure\nand screamed in despair. Huh? I don't\nwant to die. Help. The panicked group\nscrambled to escape, completely\ndisregarding their surroundings.\nHowever, in reality, they were merely\nactors manipulated by Sumu. Chapter 137.\nDeadly sins. Arrogance. Bang. Bang.\nBang. The masked man continued to\nsimulate the sound of gunfire at a\nleisurely pace. His fingertips clad in\nwhite gloves resembled the fingers of\ndeath, ready to kill anyone he touched.\nKnock knock. The fleeing men suddenly\nstiffened and fell straight to the\nground, lifeless. After that, no one\ndared to run away anymore. Everyone\nstood frozen in place, their faces\nfilled with terror, not even daring to\nbreathe loudly. Mong Yun dared not move.\nHe was afraid that he would also be\nshot. The higher one's position, the\nmore afraid one is of death because he\nis reluctant to give up everything he\nhas. He did not know whether he, as a\nsuperhuman, could withstand such a\nbizarre killing method. He dared not\ngamble. The unknown is always the most\nterrifying. If the masked man used a\nreal handgun to kill people, these\nsuperhumans would naturally not be\nafraid. What they fear is the unknown.\nThe fact that they have no idea how the\nmasked man killed people. What on earth\nis going on? Where are all the people\noutside? Are they all dead? How come no\none has come to check after such a\ncommotion? A bead of cold sweat trickled\ndown Murang Yan's forehead. He couldn't\nunderstand why so many people were\nscreaming without anyone outside\nnoticing. Where were the Mong family's\nguards? Where were the law enforcement\nofficers? The reason why no one outside\nnoticed anything unusual here was\nbecause Sumu had already used Silent\nHeaven to absorb all the sound,\npreventing it from reaching the outside\nworld. In fact, his grand performance\nhad flaws. If someone had observed\ncarefully, they would have discovered\nthat all the people who died on the\nscene were insignificant ordinary\npeople. They might have been rich and\npowerful in the outside world, but they\nwere ultimately no match for true\nnobles. Not even for Chin Zaheo, the\nrichest man in the country. Even high\nsociety circles are divided into levels.\nAnd these people are undoubtedly the\nlowest class. They don't even have\nprotective magic weapons. Perhaps they\nhave hired superhuman bodyguards, but no\none would bring a bodyguard to the\nMurong family's banquet. At most, they\nwould place the bodyguards outside. Just\nwhen the atmosphere was at its most\noppressive, a sudden gust of wind swept\nthrough the arena, and Murong Zhao\nappeared in the arena as if he had\nteleported. Patriarch Mor someone\nshouted excitedly as if they had seen a\nsavior. Bang! The masked man raised a\nfinger slightly and the man died\ninstantly. Morongjul looked at the mess\nand corpses scattered around the banquet\nhall. His face was ashen and the\nmurderous intent in his eyes was almost\ntangible as he stared intently at the\nmasked man on the high platform. \"Who\nexactly are you?\" he growled horarssely\nlike a lion issuing a warning. The\nmasked man on the high platform\nelegantly removed his top hat and bowed\nslightly to the crowd like a nobleman.\nHis calm voice reached everyone's ears.\nLet me formally introduce myself. I am\nPride, the first of the seven deadly\nsins. Impeccable etiquette, humble\nself-reference. It seemed like a very\nmodest self-introduction. Yet, for some\nreason, everyone could sense the\nunderlying arrogance beneath the surface\nof humility. Sumu casually made up a\nnon-existent organization to give the\nCrimson Flame Empire a false target.\nOtherwise, how would the Crimson Flame\nEmpire investigate after killing\nMorungjua? Morongja frowned, racking his\nbrains for a moment, but he couldn't\nfind any information about the seven\ndeadly sins organization. He could only\nmake a simple judgment based on the\nliteral meaning of the words. The seven\ndeadly sins refer to the seven original\nsins of mankind, namely pride, envy,\nwrath, sloth, greed, gluttony, and lust.\nDoes this mean there are seven people\nwho commit the seven deadly sins? I\ndon't care who you are. Hand over the\ngolden eye, and I might leave you with a\nwhole corpse. H a disdainful chuckle\nescaped his arrogant lips as if mocking\nMurang was overestimation of his\nabilities. I really want to know what\ngives someone who's just a silver three\nrank the courage to say that. A\nmurderous glint flashed in\nMurangua&lt;unk&gt;s eyes. His patience had\nreached its limit. Whoosh! He rushed\ntoward arrogance like a whirlwind,\nleaving after images in the air with his\nspeed. But after he shattered the\narrogant body with a single punch, a\nmocking voice rang out behind him. \"Too\nslow, old man. What?\" Morono was\nstartled and quickly turned around to\nattack, but his punch hit empty air.\nLooking closely, he could not see the\narrogant figure anywhere. It was as if\nthe person had vanished into thin air.\nWhere did he go? Moronga roared. Morong\nYin shook his head with a grim\nexpression. I didn't see him. He\nvanished into thin air. Disappeared into\nthin air. Mongju stared intently at\neveryone present. He couldn't have\nvanished into thin air. What I was\nchasing was just an illusion. If this\nperson truly possessed such terrifying\nspeed, he would have already escaped. He\nmust be hiding among these people,\nsealing off this area so that no one can\nleave. Yes, father. Morong Yin quickly\nagreed. He knew his father was furious\nand dared not disobey in the slightest.\nHe hurriedly led his men to seal off the\nmain entrance and windows. The\natmosphere became extremely oppressive\nonce again. Morongja&lt;unk&gt;s hawk-like\neyes kept searching through the crowd\ntrying to find Amen. But no matter how\nhard he searched, he could not find\nanyone in the crowd who was similar in\nbuild to Amen. Ding, ding, ding. The\nstirring piano music continued to play,\nmaking Muranga's temples throbb. \"Stop\nplaying,\" he roared. But the pianist\nseemed not to hear him and continued\nplaying. Whoosh! A blade of wind\ninstantly sliced through the pianist's\nbody, severing him in two, his crimson\nblood staining the black and white keys.\nAfter killing the people, Morungha was\nstunned. Not only him, but everyone else\nwas also stunned, staring blankly at the\npiano. Ding, ding, ding. The stirring\npiano music continues. The dense piano\nmusic struck everyone's heart like a\nseries of heavy hammer blows. Ghost,\nghost, someone screamed. This completely\nillogical event constantly challenging\neveryone's reason. \"Shut up!\" Morongjha\nroared, his large hands suddenly\nslashing down and countless white\nstreams of energy immediately swirled\naround his palm. \"Woosh!\" The wind\nblade, accompanied by a sonic boom,\nsliced the piano in two, but the piano\nmusic continued. This completely snapped\nthe nerves of some vulnerable people. A\nghost? He's a ghost. I can't take it\nanymore. I want to leave. Please let me\ngo. A man rushed to the gate and pleaded\nwith Mong Yun. Mong Yan&lt;unk&gt;s face\nturned extremely ugly. Get out of the\nway. He shoved the man to the ground.\nFather, what do we do now? Mongu\nsneered. He must be hiding among these\npeople, appearing and disappearing\nmysteriously, but in reality, he's just\nplaying tricks. If he's really that\npowerful, why doesn't he dare to fight\nme head on? I was planning to play a\nlittle longer, but it seems you're\nalready getting impatient. Chapter 131,\nKilling Imperial Nobles. An arrogant and\nfrivolous voice rang out in the room.\nWhen the voice rang out, everyone\npresent was shocked. Some guests who\nwere closer to Murong Yun at the door\nwere so frightened that they collapsed\nto the ground because the voice was\nclearly coming from Murong Yun. Murang\nYan&lt;unk&gt;s eyes were bloodshot as he\nfrantically scanned his surroundings,\nonly to find no one there. At that\nmoment, Muranga's hawk-like gaze fell\nupon him. \"No, it wasn't me, father. I\ndidn't say that. Of course, it's not\nyou.\" The arrogant voice rang out again,\nfollowed by a terrifying scene. Murong\nYun&lt;unk&gt;s body became a double image,\nand arrogance slowly emerged from his\nbody. \"You, Yu, Yu, you.\" Murang Yun was\nso frightened that she almost peed\nherself on the spot. She quickly checked\nher body, fearing that the other party\nhad done something to her. He strolled\nwith arrogance and composure, causing\ncrowds to disperse wherever he went. His\nsilver smile pierced Murangja&lt;unk&gt;s\neyes, causing his pupils to contract\ninvoluntarily. As a silver tier three\ntranscendent, although he rarely fought,\nhe still had keen eyesight. This kind of\nbizarre method was not one of the known\nlaws. Teleportation, possession, killing\nfrom a distance. What kind of law is\nthis? I'm getting a little tired of\nthis. It's time to take the final bow of\nthis performance. Arrogantly, he walked\ntowards Murangja step by step. His\ndisdainful attitude even making\nMuranga's face turn ashen. Whoosh!\nUnleashing several wind blades that\nblocked all directions around Ao Man.\nThe sharp wind blades sliced through Ao\nMan's body, but it was as if they were\ncutting through air, having no effect\nwhatsoever. His attack failed, but a\ncold smile appeared on his lips, and his\naged eyes gleamed with a knowing light.\nJust as I expected, you didn't create\nthe slightest breeze as you moved, and\nyou were able to ignore my wind danced\nspirit blade. If I'm not mistaken, this\nis not your true form at all. It's\nnothing but a mere illusion. This old\nnobleman eventually discovered the clue.\nAll his laws were related to the wind.\nAnd if one paid close attention, one\ncould naturally perceive that\narrogance's every move did not stir up\nthe slightest breeze. The wind is\neverywhere. Whether you walk, make a\nsound, or even tremble your hair, it\nwill create a breeze. This is difficult\nfor ordinary people to notice, but it is\nnot difficult for Mongjua. He hadn't\nnoticed it before because people are\nultimately used to perceiving with their\neyes, and his entire mind had long been\ndisturbed by the golden eye. Arrogance\nremained arrogant even after his\nbackground was exposed and his voice\nbecame increasingly mocking. So you\npeople are used to calling things you\ncan't understand illusions. It seems\nI'll have to get a little more serious.\nentire banquet hall began to flicker\nfrequently as if the circuit had been\ninterfered with and the connection had\nbecome faulty. The arrogant figure\nappeared and disappeared like a ghost\nand the silver smiling mask on his face\nseemed to come alive at this moment with\nthe mocking look on his lips becoming\neven more intense. In an instant, a low\nancient murmur filled the air as if\ngushing from a dark abyss. It was an\nincomprehensible murmur full of chaos\nand madness. A serious provocation\nagainst human reason. Uh uh uh. Screams\nrang out continuously. Some ordinary\npeople in the scene were like madmen,\ncollapsing to the ground in pain, their\nbodies struggling, and their muttering\nsounds like slender fingers scraping\ntheir eardrums. The shadow beneath\nArrogance's feet bloomed and twisted\nlike a kaleidoscope, splitting into tin\nin the blink of an eye, surrounding him.\nThe shadows dispersed, and countless\ntiny tadpole-like runes moved within the\ntwists, covering the entire banquet\nhall. Mongja&lt;unk&gt;s expression suddenly\nchanged. He suddenly doubted his\njudgment. The terrifying murmur clearly\ncarried some kind of evil power unlike\nan illusion. This is certainly not an\nillusion, but rather the serpent god's\nmurmur simulated by Su Mu using silent\nheavenly music. Although it has form but\nno spirit, it is more than enough to\ninfluence some ordinary people. Mongjua,\nI hereby pronounce you dead. Amidst the\neerie murmurss, an arrogant voice rang\nout like a divine judgment filled with\nindifference and superiority. slashed at\nMorongjhua, who was still several meters\naway, while the flashing lights just\nhappened to go out. Flowers bloom in an\ninstant. Time seemed to freeze at that\nmoment, and everyone stood motionless as\nif time had stopped. Even those who had\nfallen and screamed were now silent.\nArrogance remained in the raised hand\ngesture, and the fear on Murangea's face\nhad long since solidified, as had the\nfear on the faces of the others. But if\nyou look closely, it's not time standing\nstill at all. People are still moving,\nbut their movements have become\nincredibly slow. Faced with the arrogant\nmovements, Mong's aged eyebrows furrowed\nat a snail's pace. Mly in the crowd\nmoved. As if her soul had left her body,\nshe stepped out of her own body, leaving\nbehind an identical copy of herself,\nmaintaining the original posture. The\none who remained in the same spot was an\nillusion created by Su Mu beforehand.\nThe real Nangong Mungley had icy eyes\nand her body seemed to be under immense\npressure as she trembled as she moved\nforward. Her speed was not fast, but\ncompared to the movements of others\nwhich were countless times slower, her\nspeed was so fast that the human eye\ncould not form an image on the retina.\nShe walked step by step, her body\nshrouded in darkness, and soon she\nreached the back of arrogance. She\ncontinued forward, her figure gradually\noverlapping with Arrogance's. And then,\nas if passing through a mold, she walked\nout of Arrogance's body, and came to\nMurangja's front. Moronga finally\nreacted. Fear and shock took shape on\nhis face at an incredibly slow pace, and\nhis pupils began to contract. He seemed\nto realize something, and his right hand\nslowly rose upwards. Watching the other\nparty's movements, which seemed to be in\n10 times slow motion, Nangong Moons lips\ncurled into a cold smile. Go to hell,\nMongjua. Whoosh! A flash of cold light\nappeared. It was the Myithil dagger in\nNang Mung&lt;unk&gt;s hand, she used all her\nstrength in this strike, carrying 20\nyears of hatred and slashed at\nMuranga&lt;unk&gt;s neck without any\nhindrance. A thin line of blood\nappeared, revealing the throat,\nneckbone, and fresh blood inside. Fresh\nblood spurted out, crawling into the air\ndrop by drop. After doing all this, Nang\nGong Mungly seemed completely exhausted,\nher face turning pale. She struggled to\nsupport her nearly collapsing body and\nreturned to her original position. But\nher expression was incredibly relaxed,\nas if she had unloaded a heavy burden.\nThe moment she returned to her place,\ntime resumed its normal flow. The\nflashing lights shone brightly,\nilluminating the horrifying scene before\nthem. Under the watchful eyes of\neveryone, the arrogant hand slowly\nlowered and at the same time a line of\nblood appeared on Morongha&lt;unk&gt;s neck.\nThe line of blood expanded at a visible\nspeed, sizzling and hissing. Blood\ngushed out wildly. Morungja&lt;unk&gt;s head\nbegan to shift and finally with a thud,\nit fell to the ground. The entire hall\nfell silent instantly. Morongjhua is\ndead. Chapter 132. The curtain falls. In\neveryone's eyes, with a mere wave of his\nhand, arrogance severed Morongjha&lt;unk&gt;s\nhead, and this silver rank three expert\ndied in such an absurd manner. The fear\nand shock lingered on the severed head.\nThe overwhelming fear made everyone feel\nas if a huge rock was blocking their\nchests, making it impossible to breathe.\nOr rather, no one dared to breathe for\nfear of attracting the attention of the\nfigure standing in the center of the\narena. Father Murong Yun and his\nchildren were shocked. Looking at\nMurunga's headless corpse, their hearts\nwere filled with fear. They had never\nimagined that such a day would come.\nTheir once dignified and powerful father\nhad died like a joke. A gold tier\nexpert. The word gold level expert\nflashed through everyone's minds. The\nmasked man was a gold level expert.\nBesides a gold level expert, who else\ncould kill a silver level expert in one\nblow? Arrogance adjusted his top hat,\nhis mocking gaze sweeping over the crowd\nthrough his silver smiling mask. Now\nthat this matter is settled, I should be\nleaving. Tata Tata. His gleaming black\nleather shoes clattered heavily on the\nblood stained luxurious carpet. He\nstrolled leisurely toward the main gate\nas if he were in an empty house, and the\ncrowds dispersed wherever he went, with\nno one daring to look him in the eye.\nEven Morona's children dared not utter a\nsound, as if they had forgotten to\navenge their father. They were even\nsecretly relieved that the other side\nhad not intended to kill them all and\nhad only killed Morongua. But just then,\na woman's voice rang out in the room.\nStop. Everyone was instantly shocked and\nturned to look. They saw a stunningly\nbeautiful woman step forward. Her\nbeautiful face was pale and her body was\ntrembling slightly as if she were\noverwhelmed with fear. It was Nangly.\nWho are you? Why did you kill my father?\nThe voice, though not loud, was filled\nwith determination. Upon hearing this,\neveryone nearly wet themselves in fear.\nMurong Yun and the others were\nhorrified, wishing they could gag\nNangong Mongli and beg her to stop\ntalking. They were afraid that Nang Gong\nMingly would provoke Aommen and turn\naround to kill everyone present.\nArrogance stopped in his tracks, and the\nsilver masked figure slowly turned its\nhead, watching the woman who dared to\nstand up with great interest. I didn't\nexpect the Morong family to be all\nuseless. Beautiful lady, you have great\ncourage. To reward your courage, I have\ndecided not to kill you.\" After\nspeaking, amidst the horrified gazes of\nthe crowd, Arrogance raised his right\nhand again, clenching it into a gun\nshape and slowly pointed his fingertips,\ncovered by a white glove, at Nang Gong\nMungly. Nang Gong Mungly s face grew\npaler, but she still met the arrogant\ngazed defiantly. \"Answer my question.\"\nHe chuckled arrogantly. \"Why kill\nMuronga? Don't you find killing an\nimperial nobleman quite amusing?\" The\nchuckles were like the whispers of a\ndemon, sending chills down everyone's\nspines. Interesting. Kill nobles. What\nan obscure phrase. Can these two words\nreally be put together like that?\nMadman. Absolutely madman. To take\npleasure in the torture and slaughter of\nnobles. This behavior is even more\nheinous than that of the\nrevolutionaries. Bang. As the arrogant\nvoice fired a gunshot, Nangongs body\nwent limp and she fell straight to the\nground. At that moment, a pair of strong\nhands caught her slender waist and\nsupported her. With her face pale and\neyes tightly closed, Nangong Mungly\nheard a gentle male voice in her ear.\n\"Not bad acting, Nangong Mungly, who was\npretending to be unconscious, trembled\nslightly with her red lips. I can't\ncompare to you. Do me one more favor,\nyou say? Kill Shen Zaheo. Welcome to\nserve.\" Da da. His arrogant footsteps\nseemed to pound on everyone's hearts.\nEach step sending shivers down their\nspines. But as he passed by Chin Zaheo,\nhe suddenly stopped and turned to look\nat him. This sight almost sent Shin\nZahi&lt;unk&gt;'s soul soaring to heaven. His\nsmall eyes squeezed by the fat, kept\ndaring to look away, not daring to meet\nthe gaze at all. You're getting in my\nway. A deep emotionless voice came from\nthe arrogant mouth. Chian Zaheo&lt;unk&gt;s\nexpression changed drastically in an\ninstant. People around him scattered as\nif avoiding a plague, leaving him\nstanding there dumbfounded, holding a\nbouquet of bright red roses in his\nhands. He had originally planned to give\nthem to Nang Gong Mung in front of\neveryone. After Morong Zua announced the\nengagement as the richest man in\nShingqing, he reacted very quickly. In\nalmost 0.1 seconds, he threw down the\nflowers and knelt down decisively,\nthrowing all dignity and face to the\nback of his mind. My lord, spare my\nlife. I deserve to die. I'm too ugly to\noffend your eyes. I'm willing to\ncompensate you. 100 million. No, no. 10.\nShien Zahei&lt;unk&gt;'s words came to an\nabrupt halt. With an arrogant gesture,\nan identical line of blood appeared on\nShien Zahi&lt;unk&gt;'s neck, and his large\nhead fell to the ground. The necklace\naround his neck emitted only a faint\nlight before quickly extinguishing.\nFast, too fast. The speed of flower\nblooms in an instant exceeded the speed\nof the noble fantasm self protection\nleaving no time to react. After dealing\nwith Chin Zaheo Aman left completely,\nhis tall and slender figure stepping out\nof the door and disappearing into the\ndarkness. Nangong Munglay who was in\nSu&lt;unk&gt;s arms was even weaker. Her face\nwas almost bloodless and she had great\ndifficulty walking. This scene was\nexactly what Sumu had anticipated, which\nis why he deliberately arranged for Nang\nGong Mung to provoke the arrogant one,\njust so that no one would suspect why\nNaang Gong Mungly suddenly became weak.\nOf course, whether this scene happened\nor not doesn't really matter. Mongju's\ndeath was like an earthquake, shocking\neveryone's minds. Under such\ncircumstances, basically no one would\nnotice Nang Gong Mungly s abnormality.\nThis is just to be on the safe side. The\ncrowd stood there stunned as if they\nhadn't yet woken from this nightmare.\nAfter the first person screamed and\nscrambled away from the scene, everyone\nelse rushed off in a panic. Sumu\nfollowed the panicked crowd, half\nembracing Nang Gong Mungley's weak body,\nand left the scene. Soon, the two got\ninto the car. The Platinum Hotel burst\ninto flames. It was set by someone who\nhad been hypnotized by Sumu beforehand.\nHe didn't know if the Crimson Flame\nEmpire had any special means to find\nhim. So to be on the safe side, he still\nset a fire to destroy the scene. Thank\nyou, Sumu. I underestimated the side\neffects of flowers bloom in an instant.\nIf it weren't for you, I probably\nwouldn't have been able to escape and\nscathed. Nangong Moonly looked at Sumu\nand expressed her sincere gratitude.\nSumu smiled slightly. I should be\nthanking you for letting me enjoy an\ninteresting banquet. I never expected\nthat the blood of nobles is also red.\nNangong Mungi smiled weakly. Golden\nbloodline is just a name. How could a\nhuman possibly have golden blood? Oh, by\nthe way, this is for you. She placed a\nsilver ring in Sumu's hand. Chapter 133.\nChian Zahei&lt;unk&gt;'s ring. Sumu picked up\nthe ring and examined it briefly. This\nis Chien Zahi&lt;unk&gt;'s ring. His\nobservation skills have always been very\nsharp, so he naturally noticed that\nShianzah had worn this ring. Nangong\nMongly nodded. That's right. This is a\nsilver tier 1 treasure, the energy\ndevouring ring. I took it off when I\nkilled Shinszaho. After all, I went to\nthe trouble of killing him, so I\ncouldn't let it go to waste. Sumu\nglanced at Nang Gong Mly, whose face was\npale, and agreed with her strong logic.\nHe carefully wiped the ring clean with a\nwhite handkerchief before putting it on.\nThe silver ring had a very simple design\nwithout any patterns, just like an\nordinary silver ring. When he put it on,\nas his spiritual energy flowed in, he\nimmediately understood the function of\nthe energy devouring ring. It can\ndirectly convert physical or mental\nenergy into attack power. For example,\nan adult male can deliver a punch with a\nforce of 200 gene 100 caddies. But after\nusing the energy devouring ring, the\nring can absorb the energy stored in the\nbody and unleash it all, allowing you to\ndeliver a punch with a force of 1,000\ngene 500 caddies. However, the price is\nthat you become extremely thin because\nthe energy stored in your body is\ndrained. This transformation also\napplies to mental strength. Converting\nmental strength into physical power.\nHowever, few people do this because the\nrecovery of mental strength is 10 times\nmore difficult than the recovery of\nphysical strength. Physical weakness can\nbe remedied simply by eating and\ndrinking. But mental strength rarely has\nany means of replenishment and usually\nrelies on time to recover slowly.\nFurthermore, excessive extraction of\nmental energy may turn one into an\nidiot. Sumu however did not have such\nworries. He felt that the ring was very\nsuitable for him because he had enough\nmental energy and the ring could convert\nhis mental energy into real and usable\ncombat power. He roughly understood why\nChin Zaheo had made himself so fat. He\nwas probably storing up energy so that\nin the event of danger, he could unleash\nterrifying power no weaker than that of\nan extraordinary being using the energy\ndevouring ring. This ring isn't a thank\nyou gift. I've said I would definitely\nrepay you. Anything I have, I can give\nyou. Nangong Lingi leaned weakly against\nthe back of the chair, her eyelids\nalready drooping. Do you know I've\nwaited for this day for so long. I will\nnever forget the day my mother passed\naway. She held my hand and told me to\nforget the hatred and not to seek\nrevenge. But I can't forget the hatred\nof the Nang Gong family and my mother's\nhatred. They remind me all the time. I\nhave been confused and I have read many\nbooks that persuade people to do good.\nThey say that people should not live for\nhatred but should let go and cherish the\npeople who are alive. But where is\nanyone alive? I'm the only one left. The\nonly one left in the entire Nangong\nfamily. If I don't avenge them, who\nwill? The thought that those who killed\nmy family are still living happily in\nthis world fills me with hatred. I hate\nthem. Why should we die? Why? Nang Mly\nwas speaking to herself rather than to\nSu Mu, a self-narration of an Avenger.\nHer head grew heavier and heavier. Her\neyelids drooped more than once, and her\nvoice grew softer and softer. In a days,\nshe smelled a floral fragrance. The\nrefreshing aroma entered her nostrils\nand made her feel itchy. Where is the\nfragrance of flowers coming from? She\nopened her eyes with some difficulty,\nand what came into view was a tattered\nrose, as if it had been thrown to the\nground and stepped on twice. It was very\nugly. Sumu's voice rang out from the\nside. Although it's a bit inappropriate,\nit's almost midnight, so happy birthday.\nNangong Moonly stared blankly at the\nroses in front of her. At this moment,\nshe seemed to have forgotten her hatred\nand her exhaustion. Where did you get\nthese flowers? I picked him up from\nChian Zahe&lt;unk&gt;s body, just like you\nsaid. After all, it took a lot of effort\nto kill him. So, I can't just kill him\nfor nothing, right? Nangong Mungly\nchuckled softly, her eyes, which had\nbeen filled with hatred, softening\nconsiderably. She carefully took the\nnearly broken rose, brushed aside the\nstray strands of hair, and gently\ninhaled its fragrance. Her eyes curved\ninto a pair of beautiful crescent moons,\nreflecting the neon lights rushing by on\nthe roadside, as well as the sapanwood\nand roses. Thank you, Sumu. Driving,\nSumu kept his eyes straight ahead, the\nbright and dim lights of the roadside\nneon lights constantly intertwining on\nhis angular face. No need to be polite.\nIt's only right to send birthday wishes.\nAfter speaking, Sumu suddenly felt his\nlips were a little wet. He was sure he\nhadn't licked his lips, which made him\nfrown slightly. The humidity in the car\nshouldn't be that high, unless he\nglanced sideways at Nang Gong Mungly,\nonly to find that she had already fallen\ninto a deep sleep. Clutching arose\ntightly, clearly due to excessive\nexertion and exhaustion. A day later,\nthe entire city of Shingqing was under\nunprecedented martial law with a large\nnumber of law enforcement officers in\nuniform and with guns at their waist\nappearing in every corner to conduct a\nthorough search. This caused a great\ndeal of panic in Shingching. Even the\nstreets were less crowded than usual.\nThe most pitiful were the shops selling\ntuxedos. Several shops were shut down\nbecause the styles they sold were very\nsimilar to those worn by Pride, the\nfirst of the seven deadly sins. The\ntuxedos were taken back and severely\ntortured. The name of the seven deadly\nsins, pride, seemed to resound\nthroughout Star City overnight. To be\nprecise, it was in just Star City. Other\nsurrounding cities and even the entire\nCrimson Flame Empire were alarmed. The\nkilling of an Imperial noble is a major\nscandal in the Crimson Flame Empire.\nEven during wars with other countries,\nnobles have the right to be pardoned.\nEven if a noble is captured, he or she\nwill be treated well by the enemy\ncountry and wait for the enemy family to\nransom him with a large sum of money. If\nthis was the case during wartime, how\nmuch more so during peace time? The news\nof Murong Jeha's murder caused a huge\nuproar, dominating the front pages of\nmajor newspapers. Rumors are circulating\namong the noble circles of Star City\nthat the Imperial family is furious and\nhas dispatched a gold level expert to\nStar City, determined to capture the\nseven deadly sins. Pride. Seven Deadly\nSins organization also successfully\ntopped the Crimson Flame Empire's wanted\nlist, even overshadowing the\nRevolutionary Army for a time. Even the\nRevolutionary Army never killed nobles.\nIt is rumored that they only captured\nnobles and used them to exchange for\nlarge amounts of resources. I heard\nabout the fire at the Platinum Hotel\nyesterday. I heard a nobleman died\ninside. I heard that not only one\nnobleman died, but many celebrity bosses\ndied, including Chin Zaheo, the richest\nman in Shingqing. Chapter 134, gold\nlevel expert. You've only heard about\nit, but I saw it with my own eyes. I was\nworking as a waiter at the Platinum\nHotel that day. All the dignitaries of\nShing came to celebrate the birthday of\nthe Mong family head. You don't know,\nbut the pride of the seven deadly sins\nappeared out of nowhere like a ghost.\nWith a wave of his hand, the Murong\nfamily head's head fell to the ground on\nthe spot. Isn't that an exaggeration?\nIt's no exaggeration. I was terrified.\nNot only the head of the Mong family,\nbut also many other VIPs. Whoever he\npointed at would die. Everyone was too\nscared to move. In the end, we just\nwatched him leave. Oh, by the way, only\nthe third daughter of the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] family\nwas brave. She really dared to stand up\nand question Arrogance, asking him why\nhe killed people. Do you know what\nArrogance said? What did he say? What\ndid he say? He said, the man lowered his\nvoice. Don't you find killing imperial\nnobles very interesting. H. A collective\ngasp of astonishment rippled through the\nsurrounding area. Similar scenes were\nnot uncommon on the streets of\nShingqing. There were too many\nwitnesses, and the version of how the\narrogant man killed the nobleman kept\nspreading, becoming more and more\noutrageous. In the end, some people even\nsaid that he was the incarnation of a\ngod who came to punish Morona for his\nmany evil deeds. Shingqing Law\nEnforcement Bureau. We Jang, the\ndirector of the Law Enforcement Bureau,\nwas constantly wiping the sweat from his\nface with a handkerchief. He was bowing\nand scraping to a woman sitting in the\nseat. The woman was dressed in a black\nfitted outfit similar to leather which\naccentuated her slender figure. She had\nshoulderlength black hair that gave her\na capable look, and her face was\ndelicate with a healthy tan. Her lower\nbody was also covered by tight- fitting\ntrousers with smooth lines that extended\nfrom her waist to her ankles,\nhighlighting her two straight legs. The\ntrouser legs were tucked into black high\ntop tactical boots, and she wore no\nother accessories. Captain Moo, do we\nreally have to capture all the\nsurvivors? They are mostly high-ranking\nofficials and nobles in Star City, and\nsome of them even have business dealings\nwith the nobility in the capital. This\nis a huge matter, and I really can't\nmake the decision. The woman surnamed Mu\nis named Mu Lingi and she is the captain\nof the action team sent by the Capital\nLaw Enforcement Bureau. Sensing We Jangs\nreluctance, Mu Lings said coldly, \"This\nis Lord Seongs intention.\" Upon hearing\nthe name Secom, Way Jang instinctively\ntrembled, and his peripheral vision\ninvoluntarily drifted toward the man\nsitting on the sofa at the far end of\nthe office. He was a middle-aged man.\nTime had left its mark on his face, but\nit did not diminish his dignity and\ncharm. His hair was slightly silver\ngray, meticulously combed, and neatly\nswept back. He had thick eyebrows like\nswords, sharp eyes, and a well-defined\nbronze-coled face. He simply sat there\nlike a majestic mountain peak, giving\npeople a sense of unshakability. Lord\nSikong this. We looked troubled. Sikong\nraised his eyes and looked at Way Jang.\nAt that moment, Way Jang suddenly felt\nas if he were being watched by a top\npredator. He began to have difficulty\nbreathing, as if something was pressing\ndown on him and making it hard to\nbreathe. This powerful sense of\noppression made him dare not say\nanything more. \"Do as I say,\" Seekong\nXan said slowly, his voice calm yet\nauthoritative. \"Yes, Lord Seong.\" Way\nJang stood up straight abruptly like a\nsoldier facing a general. We Jang left\nto carry out orders. As soon as he left\nthe office, his face was immediately\nreplaced by a bitter expression. These\npeople sent from above showed no mercy.\nThey were quick to arrest people, but\nthey would just walk away and leave,\nleaving him to be the one who had\noffended everyone. He is the director of\nthe Shingqing Law Enforcement Bureau,\nand he will be working in Shingqing for\nthe rest of his life. Although he\nthought this way, he didn't dare to say\nit to her face. If it were just Mu Lings\nputting pressure on him, he could have\nmade excuses since she was just a\ncaptain in the general administration\nwho was technically his equal. But\nSeekong Xan had spoken and he dared not\ndisobey because Seong Xhan was a golden\nlevel superhuman from the capital and\nthe surname Seong also represented the\nother party's noble status. In the\nCrimson Flame Empire, nobles are not\nnecessarily gold level transcendants,\nbut gold level transcendants are always\nnobles. Even wild, powerful gold level\nwarriors are granted noble titles by the\nempire, which invites them to join its\nranks in order to consolidate its rule.\nWhat people truly hate is not the\nnobility, but rather the fact that they\nare not nobles themselves. Bronze Coffin\nCompany. Nangong Mung leaned back\nwearily in the large leather chair,\nwhich sagged slightly, the soft leather\nenveloping her graceful figure. A cup of\nhot tea sat on her desk, steaming\ngently. Sitting opposite her was Sumu.\nSumu held the newspaper in his hand,\nsipping hot tea as he examined it. The\nheadline described the seven deadly\nsins. pride, a heinous crime involving\nthe public assassination of an imperial\nnobleman for which he was wanted\nnationwide. We jang the director of the\nShingqing Law Enforcement Bureau, called\nme and ordered everyone who attended the\nbanquet to go to the bureau. It's&lt;unk&gt;\nmandatory. He said it was an order from\nSikong Xan, a gold level expert from the\ncapital. Nangong Moonly said wearily.\nThe after effects of flowers bloom in an\ninstant were too great. Even after\nresting for a day, she still hadn't\nrecovered. However, this also proves its\npower. To step into the realm of time\nwith a human body is the strongest known\nsilver law. Ever since witnessing the\nflower blooms in an instant. That day,\nSumu understood why the Crimson Flame\nEmpire's royal family was determined to\neliminate the Nangong family. No one\nwanted such terrifying power to be in\nthe hands of others. During wartime, the\nNangong family is the best weapon. But\nonce peace arrives, the royal family\nwill begin to be wary and even afraid as\nno one wants to keep someone who can\nkill them at any time by their side.\nNangong Mingly can instantly kill a\nsilver level three if she is already at\nthe silver level one. So what if she\nreaches the gold level? Activating\nflowers bloom in an instant comes at the\ncost of burning your lifespan. How much\nof your lifespan did you consume this\ntime? Sumu asked. Nangong Lingly seemed\nunwilling to bring up the matter, but\nshe still answered. 5 years. 5 years to\nlive. Sumu's eyes flickered slightly.\nThis number didn't sound like much, but\nhow many 5-year periods does one have in\na lifetime? Silver-level superhumans are\nstill human beings after all. Even with\ntheir immense power, their lifespan is\nnot much longer than that of ordinary\npeople. Each use of their power lasts\nfor 5 years, so they can't use it too\nmany times in their lifetime. This is a\nspecial case because the gap between me\nand [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is too large. In order to\navoid any unforeseen complications, I\nmust activate the power of blooming\nmoment to the maximum to obtain the\nultimate speed and not give him any time\nto react. Therefore, it will consume\nmore energy. If I were to deal with a\nweaker enemy, it would not consume this\nmuch energy. Sumu nodded. Do you know\nanything about Sungongjin? Nang Wingly\nseemed a little cold. Her slender hands\nholding the cup of hot tea, the steam\nblurring her face. I don't know. The\ninformation of every gold level expert\nis top secret and not allowed to be\ncirculated. However, I do know a little\nbit. I heard it from Chenzah. The Seong\nfamily approved Chien Zahi&lt;unk&gt;s Myithil\nmining license at the time. He mentioned\nhis connections in the capital to show\nme his strength, but these connections\nwere nothing special. All the wealthy\npeople in the country were scrambling to\ncurry favor with the nobles in the\ncapital, and Shenzah was just one of\nthem. Now that Sungong Xhan has come, it\nseems the myithal mind left behind by\nChin Zaho won't&lt;unk&gt;t be able to stay.\nChapter 135. Interrogation. Sumu smiled\nslightly. He roughly understood why\nSikong was the one who came to\ninvestigate. Even nobles would be\ntempted by the value of the Myithil\nmine. It was not hard to imagine that\nShi would definitely send a large amount\nof funds to the Seong family every year\nin order to obtain protection. Now that\nShiin Zahi was dead, the Seikkong family\nnaturally had to find a new agent to\ntake over the Mithil mine. Of course,\nShi couldn't just send money to the\nSeong family. He also had dealings with\nother nobles in the capital and even\nvarious departments. Personal\nrelationships are never a straight line,\nbut a complex and intricate network. The\ndecision of who to send to Star City for\nthis investigation likely involved a\nsmall power struggle among the nobles of\nthe capital. In the end, the Seikcom\nfamily emerged victorious, coming to\nreap the rewards and incidentally\ninvestigate the seven deadly sins.\nPride. Let's go to the law enforcement\nbureau. Don't keep our distinguished\nguests from the capital waiting. Sumu\nslowly got up from the sofa, elegantly\nstraightened his slightly wrinkled\nclothes, picked up his snakeskin cane,\nand left with Nang Gong Monglay. Shing\nlaw enforcement bureau interrogation\nroom. The lighting was dim with only one\nspotlight on in the interrogation room\nshining directly into the center. The\ncentral area was empty except for a\nchair made of myithil alloy which was\ncast into the ground and looked very\nsturdy. Mong Yun was so blinded by the\nlight that he could barely open his\neyes. His body was bound to the myithil\nalloy chair. Looking at the blurry\nfigures hidden in the darkness beyond\nthe light. He felt inexplicably nervous.\nThis was the first time he had entered\nthe law enforcement bureau in this\nmanner. Normally, he would have been\ndissatisfied long ago, but upon hearing\nthat it was Sikong Xan who gave the\norder, he could only suppress his\ndissatisfaction. He was indeed a\nnobleman, but even nobles were divided\ninto different ranks. If [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] were\nstill alive, the Mong family might have\nsome standing among the nobles of the\ncapital. But now, Mong Yun, tell me the\ndetails of the incident. Tell me\neverything you know without hiding\nanything. In the darkness, Mu Lings icy\nvoice rang out. Mong Yun glanced at the\nother party. Although the other party's\nfigure was hidden in the darkness, as a\nsilver second tier transcendent, he\ncould naturally see him clearly. She's a\nbeauty. Beautiful women are not\nimportant. He has plenty of those. What\ntruly interests him is the woman's\nidentity. A law enforcement captain from\nthe General Law Enforcement Bureau. When\na beautiful woman is adorned with the\naura of high rank and power, it does\nindeed make him somewhat tempted. Of\ncourse, right now he only dares to itch.\nAll of this was due to pressure from the\ngolden aristocracy. Mong Yun began to\nrecount the events honestly. He spoke in\ngreat detail and embellished the story\nto some extent as he didn't want anyone\nto know that he had been like a fool\nunable to move when his father died. He\nfrequently displayed grief and\nresentment, acting very much like a\nvictim who had lost his father. Mu\nLingsy listened expressionlessly while\nthe law enforcement staff beside her\ntook notes. Captain Mu, I've told you\neverything I know. You must find\narrogance and avenge my father. He's an\nImperial nobleman. Before Murong Yun\ncould finish speaking, Mu Lingsy\ninterrupted him. As far as I know,\narrogance once possessed you. Why didn't\nyou mention that? Mong Yun&lt;unk&gt;s heart\nskipped a beat and her expression\nstiffened slightly. I forgot for a\nmoment, but it wasn't possession. He\njust walked out of my body. He He was\nlike a ghost, as if he had no physical\nform. I didn't feel anything unusual at\nthe time, and I checked myself when I\ngot back, and my body was indeed fine. A\nghost. Other witnesses said that the\nMurong family had suspected that\narrogance was not a physical entity, but\nan illusion. What do you think about\nthis? Mong Yin shook his head\nrepeatedly. How could it be an illusion?\nHow could there be such a realistic\nillusion in this world? I saw arrogance\nkill people with my own eyes. He killed\nmany people, and his methods were very\nstrange. He could kill anyone he pointed\nat with just a finger. Even my father,\nhe just waved his hand and my father's\nhead fell to the ground. When Murang Yin\ntalked about her father, she\nunconsciously began to choke up and her\neyes reened. My father made this\njudgment because of his arrogance and\nlack of a sense of wind. He was misled\nby his preconceived notions. A gold\nlevel expert can perfectly conceal all\nhis aura and blend into the surrounding\nenvironment. It is not difficult for him\nto walk without a sense of wind. You\nthink arrogance is a gold level\ntranscendent? Mu lingsy s eyes narrowed\nslightly. Murong Yun was somewhat\nexcited. Of course, it's a gold level\ntranscendent. How could someone other\nthan a gold level transcendent do this?\nYou don't know. Back then, he said he\nhad enough fun and was going to get\nserious. Then his powerful aura directly\naffected the lights in the banquet hall,\ncausing them to flicker. Eerie,\ndelirious chanting echoed all around.\nMany guests died instantly upon hearing\nthe sounds. Who else could it be but a\ngold ranking transcendent? Who else but\na gold ranking transcendent could\naccomplish this? He was exaggerating. In\nreality, the serpent god's murmurss\ndidn't kill the guests. At most, they\ncaused ordinary people to have splitting\nheadaches or faint. After all, it was a\nmurmur imitated using this silent\nheavenly music, so its power was\nlimited. However, Mong Yun still wanted\nto exaggerate because only the more\npowerful arrogance was, the less he\nwould appear incompetent. If arrogance\nwere a silver transcendent, how could\nthe entire Mong family hold their heads\nhigh in the aristocratic circle? It will\nbe all over the place by then. Have you\nheard? The Mong family held a banquet on\ntheir own territory, and a silver-level\ntranscendent came knocking on their\ndoor. Not only did he kill the Mong\nfamily head in one move, but he also\nscared the entire Mong family so much\nthat no one dared to move. Thank you for\nyour cooperation. Someone take Mr.\nMurong Yun downstairs for a medical\ncheckup. Murang Yan&lt;unk&gt;s expression\nchanged slightly. Didn't I already say I\nhad someone conduct a comprehensive\ncheckup after I got back? He began to\nprotest. After all, no one likes their\nbody being manipulated at will by people\nwho don't understand them, especially if\nsome supernatural methods are used.\nThere might be some after effects.\nHowever, no one paid attention to his\nprotests. This Star City nobleman was no\nmatch for the true golden noble. After\nMurong Yun was taken away, a staff\nmember asked, \"Captain Mu,\" the lie\ndetectors sounded an alarm several\ntimes. Murong Yun lied in many places,\nespecially when he expressed his grief\nfor his father. Mu Lings lips curled\ninto a mocking smile. \"I've seen plenty\nof this kind of person. He can't wait\nfor the head of the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] family to die\nso he can inherit the entire family. I\ndon't care about the petty squables\namong nobles. I'm here for only one\npurpose, to capture arrogance. bring the\nnext one in. Mungley, dressed in plain\nclothes and without any makeup, entered\nthe interrogation room. Her appearance\nmade Mu Lings eyes narrow slightly.\nAfter Nangong Mungley sat down in the\ninterrogation chair, Mu Lings began to\nask questions. Miss Morong, I heard that\nyou were the only person at the entire\nbanquet who dared to stand up and\nquestion arrogance. Chapter 136. Nangong\nMung s acting skills. Nangong Mun&lt;unk&gt;s\ncold face revealed no emotion. She\ncalmly nodded. Mu Lings raised an\neyebrow and picked up the documents on\nthe table. Mong Mi, 23 years old.\nBirthday is September 17th. Mother\nWiping was once a slave bought by the\nhead of the Murong family from human\ntraffickers. Is the above information\ntrue? Nang Mungly s expression remained\nunchanged. It's&lt;unk&gt; true. Mu Lings\ncasually tossed the documents onto the\ntable, leaned forward slightly, and her\nsharp gaze seemed to pierce through the\ndarkness as she landed on Nan Gong\nMonglay. Based on the evidence I have,\nMoronwood doesn't seem to treat you\nwell. There are even rumors that your\nmother was indirectly killed by him.\nThis makes me very curious. None of your\nbrothers and sisters have the courage to\nstand up for you. So, what makes you\ndare to stand up for Murangua? Nangong\nMoonly slightly raised her eyes and met\nthose sharp eyes. She pondered for a\nmoment and finally said slowly. That's\nnot a rumor. My mother died because of\nhim. Oh, Mu Lingsy s lips curled up\nslightly. That makes it even more\ninteresting. Logically speaking, you\nshould hate Muronga, but you have done\nsomething contrary to common sense. Why\nis that? What do you think I am?\nNangongi suddenly asked a very strange\nquestion. This made Mu Lingsy frown.\nWhat do you mean? Aren't you the third\nyoung lady of the Morong family? Do you\nhave another identity? Nanggong Mungly\nnodded calmly. When Morungha was alive,\nI was the high and mighty third young\nlady of the Morong family. But what am I\nnow that Morongjhua is dead? Mu Lingsy\nEspouse furrowed deeper and deeper as if\nshe had understood something. I do hate\nhim, but I don't hate Ranga Fuguay. He\ncan die, but I must have a share of the\nMurong family's inheritance. This is\nwhat he owes me, and it is what I\ndeserve. His cold words revealed a hint\nof firm ambition. So, you're standing up\nfor yourself to make a name for yourself\nand thus fight for the inheritance.\nOtherwise, what? Nangong Mungley&lt;unk&gt;s\nlips curled into a smile seemingly with\na hint of pleasure. If not for yourself,\nthen for Mongu, aren't you afraid that\narrogance will kill you? I'm not afraid.\nWhy aren't you afraid? Because arrogance\nis also a man's trait, and beautiful\nwomen always receive some preferential\ntreatment in front of men, and this has\nproven to be true. Nangong mungly smiled\nand the dazzling light softened under\nher smile. Her eyes and brows were\npainted with a shimmering color by the\nlight. The two male law enforcement\nofficers in the room suddenly began to\nbreathe heavily and an uncontrollable\nlook of amazement flashed in their eyes.\nMu Lingsy coughed lightly, bringing the\ntwo male law enforcement officers back\nto their senses. The two lowered their\nheads somewhat awkwardly. Next question.\nMiss Morome, what is your relationship\nwith Sumu? He is a shareholder of the\nbronze coffin and my business partner.\nI'm afraid it's not that simple. Chian\nZaheo is your fiance yet you brought Su\nMu to the banquet. Aren't you afraid? I\nlike him. Nang Gong Lingly said coolly,\nher straightforward words causing Mu\nLingsy to pause slightly. You like him?\nMu Lingsy was very skeptical. Would a\nwoman who was willing to risk her life\nfor her own wealth and glory easily fall\nin love with a man from the lower city?\nWhat is that not allowed? Miss [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\njudging from what you just said, wealth\nand power seem to be more important to\nyou than love. A nightmare apostle from\nthe lower city is only at the bronze\nlevel. He can't possibly be as good as\nChin Zaheo, the richest man in Star\nCity, right? Yet, you chose to attend\nthe banquet with Sumu instead of Chin\nZaheo. That in itself is quite\nintriguing. At this moment, Nang Gong\nMly suddenly revealed a meaningful\nsmile. Captain Mu, I think you will know\nthe answer to this question the moment\nyou meet Su Mu. Are there any other\nquestions? If not, I need to go back and\nmourn for Mongu. Mu Lings stared at him\nfor a moment, then finally let Nang Gong\nMly go. Captain Mu, Miss Murong did not\nlie. The lie detector did not sound an\nalarm throughout the entire process. Mu\nLingsy glanced at the lie detector, her\neyes filled with an unreadable\nexpression. Bring Sumu in. The moment\nSumu entered, Mu Lings and the others\nfinally understood why Nang Gong Mungly\nhad said those words. This man, dressed\nin a sharp suit, wearing brown glasses,\nand holding a snakes-kinned cane, looked\nlike an aristocrat, straight out of a\nclassical oil painting, naturally\nexuding an elegant and composed air.\nWhen he sat in the interrogation chair,\nthe blinding light shining on him was\nlike a spotlight on a stage,\nilluminating a superstar and giving his\nfair, flawless skin a fluorescent glow\nwithout any visible pores or pimples,\nlike the smoothest silk in the world. At\nthis moment, Mu Lingsy felt a flutter in\nher heart. This feeling had nothing to\ndo with love. It was just like the\ninstinctive reaction of a man seeing a\nbeautiful woman or a beautiful woman\nseeing a handsome man. People always\nlike to pursue beautiful things. How can\na grown man have skin this good? Pretty\nboy. Mu Lingsy cursed inwardly a couple\nof times before suppressing the strange\nfeeling in her heart. She was there to\ninterrogate, not to admire handsome men.\nMr. Su, you were not invited to the\nbanquet. Why did you attend? Sumu wore a\ngentle smile, his soft gaze seemingly\nable to pierce through the darkness as\nhe looked at Mu Lings, who was asking\nthe question. He was like a gentleman\nwith good manners. Always remembering to\nlook at the other person when talking to\nthem and to give them enough respect at\nthe invitation of a beautiful lady. Is\nit [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Mly? Exactly. What is your\nrelationship with her colleague and\nfriend? Oh, Mu Lings narrowed her eyes\nslightly, but I think Miss Mong and you\nhave a close relationship. Moreover, she\njust admitted that she likes you. As far\nas I know, when Aomomen was leaving, he\nsuddenly stopped and turned around to\nkill your rival Chinzah. Why did he not\nkill others but only Chin Zaheo? And\nanother thing, you brought the golden\neye back from the nightmare world and\nthen gave it to Murang Mungli to present\nto the Mong family head. But just by\nchance, arrogance suddenly appeared and\nstole the golden eye. What do you have\nto say? Sumu was still smiling. You\nsuspect me of being arrogant? If you\ncan't answer this question, then I have\nreason to doubt you. Sumu calmly pushed\nup his brown tinted glasses and smiled\ngently. Captain Moo, if I may be frank.\nDo you think you would still be sitting\nthere and scathed, asking me questions?\nSnap. A male law enforcement officer\nslammed his hand on the table. Sumu,\nwatch your tone. This is the law\nenforcement station, not your home. He\nhad long disliked Sumu. Jealousy between\nmen is most obvious. Sumu looked at the\nmale law enforcement officer with a deep\ngaze. Even though he was restrained by\nthe interrogation chair, his words still\nmade people feel as if they had fallen\ninto an ice cave. Chapter 137. If I were\npride, what do you think would happen?\nHis tone was calm and gentle, without\nthe slightest hint of threat, but rather\nas if he were joking with an old friend.\nSir, aren't you afraid that I am truly\narrogant? Upon hearing this, the male\nlaw enforcement officer felt a chill run\ndown his spine. If I were truly\narrogant, guess what would happen? I\nwould speak disrespectfully to someone\nwho is suspected to be a gold saint. You\nmight think this is the law enforcement\nagency with a gold level expert in\ncharge capable of capturing arrogance.\nBut before capturing arrogance, it's\nquite reasonable for him to casually\nkill a few insignificant people. Isn't\nit Yuyu? The male law enforcement\nofficer seemed to have something choking\nhim. Unable to speak at all, or rather,\nhe dared not speak anymore. He was\nindeed afraid. If Sumu was truly\narrogant, he knew he wouldn't survive.\nHe didn't believe that someone who dared\nto kill even nobles wouldn't dare to\nkill someone in the law enforcement\nbureau. Sumu chuckled softly. Sir, don't\nbe afraid. I was just joking. After all,\nI'm just a second tier bronze\ntranscendent. How could I be arrogant?\nThis joke is not funny at all. Muingi\nsaid coldly. Sumu shrugged, looking\nnonchalant. Looks like I don't have much\nof a talent for humor. Sumu, what is\nyour bronze law? Mega Force punch and\nthe other one. Instead of answering\ndirectly, Sumu suddenly asked, \"Don't\nyou think it's too dark here?\" Mu Lingsy\nfrowned, about to speak, when she heard\na click and the interrogation room\nlights were turned on. She turned around\nabruptly and looked at the staff member\nguarding the door. \"What are you doing?\"\nThe staff member scratched his head\nblankly. \"I I just think it's a bit\ndark.\" Mu Lings realized something and\nquickly shifted her gaze to Sumu, her\neyes sharp as swords. Was this your\ndoing? Sumu nodded. Bronze law sequence\n44. Mind control and thought guidance\ncan be commonly referred to as hypnosis.\nThis is a real bronze law and it's also\nthe one most similar to his hypnotic\nability. He doesn't intend to hide his\nhypnotic ability because it's easy to\nfind out. Mu lingsy s gays remain sharp.\nYour actions are already considered a\nprovocation against the law enforcement\nbureau. Actions speak louder than words,\ndon't they? Sumu's words had a double\nmeaning and no one knew what he really\nmeant. Was he trying to prove his\nhypnotic abilities through action or was\nhe telling Mu Lingsy not to make such\nmeaningless threats and to just take\naction? Suddenly, Mu Lingsy smiled and\nsaid, \"Mr. Sue, you are very arrogant,\nwhich is very similar to arrogance, the\nfirst of the seven deadly sins.\"\nHowever, the arrogance of the seven\ndeadly sins is even more outward. He\nrecklessly barged into the banquet and\nkilled people. He clearly had the\nstrength to kill Mura instantly, but he\ninsisted on playing around with him\nfirst. You are reserved and seemingly\ngentle, treating everyone equally, but\nin reality, you don't take anyone\nseriously. Even in the law enforcement\nbureau with a gold level expert in\ncharge, you still dare to act\narbitrarily. Even Murong Yun, a silver\ntwo and a nobleman, couldn't help but\nfeel nervous and anxious here. But you,\na bronze two from the lower city, didn't\npanic at all from beginning to end. I'm\nreally curious why that is. Perhaps you\nreally are just arrogant. Sumu smiled\nslightly and gave Mu Lingsy an answer\nthat surprised her. Because I am the\nnightmare apostle. Mu Lingsy was taken\naback. Nightmare apostle? Yes, he was a\nnightmare apostle. A type of person who\nfaced the dangers of the nightmare world\nat any moment. These kinds of people are\neither hysterical or paranoid and\ninsane. It's hard to find a normal\nperson among them. Not every normal\nperson can remain calm and collected\nwhen they are fully aware that they are\nabout to die. The explanation was\nreasonable, but she still felt something\nwas off. She felt that Sumu had the\nmadness of a nightmare apostle, but he\ndidn't seem like one. However, she\nultimately said nothing and let Sumu go.\nAfter Sumu left, the law enforcement\nofficer who had been intimidated earlier\nsaid with a grim expression, \"Captain\nMu, are we just going to let him go like\nthis? Look at his attitude. He might\nreally be arrogant. Mu Lingsy glanced at\nhim sideways and said indifferently, \"Do\nyou think we would still be alive if he\nwere truly arrogant?\" Lord Seong Xan\nwent to the Myithil mine and wasn't at\nthe enforcement bureau at all. Even if\nhe were arrogant, would you dare to\narrest him? The law enforcement\nofficer's face stiffened and he was\nspeechless with frustration. Moreover,\naccording to normal logic, he shouldn't\nbe arrogance. Arrogance has the strength\nto instantly kill a silver tier three\ntranscendent and is suspected to be a\ngold tier expert. Sumu, on the other\nhand, is just a nightmare apostle from\nthe lower city. I checked his\ninformation. He hasn't been a nightmare\napostle for very long, and he can\nalready be considered a genius for\nreaching bronze tier 2. The law\nenforcement officer looked up, his tone\nslightly hurried, and said, \"Since he's\nbronze, too, then arrest him, too.\" Mu\nLingsy s sharp gaze was fixed on the law\nenforcer causing him to tremble and\nswallow the rest of his words. He's not\narrogant. So why arrest him just because\nhe joked with you? We are law\nenforcement officers, not gangsters.\nYes, Captain Mu, I understand. The law\nenforcement officer lowered his head in\nshame, though it was all an act. There\nare few magnanimous people in this\nworld, and no one will bow their head\nand admit their mistake because of\nsomeone else's words, unless that person\nis a leader. When the leader is in your\npresence, you have no choice but to\nacknowledge it. He cursed inwardly. It's\nnot that I can't catch you because of\nyour arrogance, but that you're too\narrogant to catch me. What the hell are\nyou doing here? Did his lie detector\nlight up? No, it didn't light up even\nonce the entire time. Mu Lings narrowed\nher eyes slightly. The lie detector only\njudges whether someone is lying based on\ntheir heartbeat. Some criminals with\nstrong mental fortitude will not trigger\nthe lie detector even if they lie.\nArrogance allows him to kill imperial\nnobles with impunity. His mental\nfortitude must far surpass that of\nordinary people. The subordinate who was\nfiddling with the lie detector cast a\nquestioning look at him. I know what\nyou're thinking. Why do you insist on\nusing a lie detector even though you\nknow it's useless? Mu lingsy s lips\ncurled into a smug, confident smile.\nThis is a reverse lie detector test. On\naverage, people lie at least 25 times a\nday, mainly for three purposes. showing\noff, pleasing others, and self-p\nprotection. Many lies are said\nsubconsciously, such as Murang Yun. Even\nas a victim, there are still many lies\nin his words that have been processed by\nhis subjective consciousness. You mean\nlying is normal and not lying is\nabnormal? Mu Lings shook her head. You\ncan understand it that way, but the lie\ndetector can only be used as a\nreference. There are many people in this\nworld with strong mental fortitude,\nespecially among the superhumans. My\nreal purpose is to make them lower their\nguard. Lower your guard. The man's eyes\nwidened. Do you have other tricks up\nyour sleeve? Mu Lingsy stopped talking\nand stared at the person who asked the\nquestion with interest. Shalley, you've\nbeen talking a bit too much today.\nChapter 138, Bronze Laws, Dream Journey,\nand Spiritual Traces. Shalley looked\nslightly flustered. I didn't mean\nanything by it. I just wanted to learn\nmore from Captain Mu. Was it the\nquestion you just asked that you wanted\nto ask or the question that Sumu wanted\nto ask? Shiaoli's expression immediately\nchanged drastically. Captain Mu, what\nare you talking about? What does this\nhave to do with Sumu? Of course, there's\na connection. If he could control you to\nturn on the lights just now, why\ncouldn't he control you to investigate\nthe law enforcement agency's secrets?\nCaptain, I'm not. I'm willing to undergo\na mental health check by the law\nenforcement agency. I'll make sure you\nundergo a mental examination even\nwithout you saying so. Someone take\nShalley away for a checkup. Not only\nhim, but all the ordinary law\nenforcement officers that Su Mu just\ncontacted must undergo mental\nexaminations. Following Mu Ling CS\norder, the law enforcement bureau was\nthrown into chaos with many people being\ntaken away for inspection without any\nexplanation. Let me go. I'm mentally\nsound. I don't want a mental\nexamination. Someone shouted in panic.\nAs an employee of the law enforcement\nagency, he naturally knew what a mental\nexamination meant. The mind is different\nfrom the body. Even a slight mistake can\ncause permanent damage. A routine X-ray\nat the hospital involves radiation, let\nalone a mental examination. Mu Lingsy\nwas very cautious, but Sumu was even\nmore cautious. Sumu, who was used to\nhypnotizing others, did not hypnotize\nthe ordinary employees of the law\nenforcement bureau this time. Firstly,\nbecause ordinary employees had no access\nto classified information, so hypnosis\nwould be useless. Secondly, the law\nenforcement bureau might have some means\nto check for hypnosis. After all, it was\nled by a gold level expert and a group\nof elites from the Imperial Capital Law\nEnforcement Bureau came. If hypnosis is\nreally that powerful, then the bronze\nlaw of mind control wouldn't only be\nranked 44th. Night. After a busy day,\nthe gold level transcendent being Lord\nSeong Xan returned. His usually\nfuroughed brows relaxed for once and he\ncouldn't help but feel happy as he\nthought of the Mithril or he had just\nacquired. He figured he couldn't have\ncome for nothing. He had the Mithil mine\nin hand and the Mong family too. As the\nlocal tyrants of Shingqing, the Mong\nfamily controlled a considerable number\nof industries. Now that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is dead,\nthe Mong family is left with only a few\nmembers. If handled properly, they may\nbe able to extract even more profits.\nKnock knock. A soft knock sounded on the\ndoor. Sung Xan, whose train of thought\nhad been interrupted, frowned slightly.\nGo in. With a snap, the door was pushed\nopen by Mu Lings, who was holding a list\nin her hand. She went straight to the\npoint and said, Lord Seong, this is the\nlist of suspects from the banquet. I\nhave screened all the people who\nattended the banquet and found a few key\nsuspects. Please take a look. Sung Xen\ndidn't reach out to take it, but waved\nhis hand dismissively. You're a\nprofessional at investigating cases, so\njust go ahead and do it. I'm only\nresponsible for arresting people. If you\nreally find arrogance, then let me know.\nMu Lings expression was indifferent, as\nif she had already expected this\noutcome. She didn't buy into Seikong Xiq\nremarks at all. He clearly didn't want\nto get involved, but instead put a\nprofessional label on himself. Lord\nSeong, my plan is this. First, let these\nsuspects think they've passed the\nscreening. Once they lower their guard,\nwe can proceed with the second step.\nSikong Xan interrupted saying, \"You are\nin charge of handling all these matters.\nYou don't need to report to me. I only\nneed the exact location of arrogance.\"\n\"Yes, Lord Sikong.\" Muing put away the\nlist and left the office\nexpressionlessly. \"Bonze coffin\ncompany.\" Suma was playing with Bubai.\nAfter being fed a lot of spiritual\nenergy, Bubai had grown new arms and was\ngrowing taller and taller from more than\n2 meters to 3 meters, showing a sense of\nno destruction, no construction. Eat up,\neat up, poor child. I bet you haven't\nhad a proper meal before you met me,\nhave you? Sumu continuously poured his\nmental energy into Bubai's body, even\nthough the other party was already full.\nHe kept pouring it in and his mental\nenergy was replenished every day, which\nwas equivalent to automatic refresh. If\nhe didn't consume more, it would be a\nwaste. Finally, he stopped when he saw\nthe 3- m tall, slender-limmed woman with\na large belly, looking as if she were\npregnant. Then, he lay down on the bed,\nclosed his eyes, and fell asleep, a\nhopeful smile on his lips, as if\nanticipating what surprises tomorrow\nwould bring. Time passed by, and soon it\nwas late at night. Sumu was already fast\nasleep. He slept, but others were still\nawake. Inside the law enforcement\nbureau, Mucci held a cup of coffee,\ntaking small sips. Sitting opposite her\nwas a young man with severe dark circles\nunder his eyes and thinning hair. The\nman wore thick rimmed black glasses and\nhad lifeless eyes. His eyelids kept\nopening and closing, clearly indicating\nthat he was extremely tired. Ching Mu\nLingsy called the man's name, and he\nimmediately woke up, hurriedly wiping\naway his drool. Huh? What time is it?\n2:00 in the morning. It's already 2:00\na.m. Ching&lt;unk&gt;s face fell and he tidied\nhis sparse hair. Captain, can we start\nnow? I really can't stay up any longer.\nLook at me. I'm almost bald now. When I\ngo out and tell people I work in the law\nenforcement bureau, no one believes me.\nThey all say I'm a programmer. Mu Lingsy\nnodded. Wait a little longer. The night\nlife in the upper city is very vibrant\nand many people stay up late. Wait\nanother half hour. After half an hour,\nactivate dream journey to infiltrate the\ntargets dream. Upon hearing that there\nwas still half an hour left, Ching\nlooked utterly devastated. Ugg. Why is\nmy ability called dream journey? It\nshould be renamed sleep in the night so\nI have to stay up all night with the\ntarget every time and then sleep with\nthem after they fall asleep. Shut up.\nMoo Linky scolded. What are you\ncomplaining about? This is the greatest\nuse of dream journey spirit tracks.\nPeople are defenseless in dreams. So, it\nis the easiest time to extract secrets.\nBack then, you failed all five subjects\nin the law enforcement exam. But I\nvalued your abilities and made an\nexception to admit you. Is this how you\nrepay me? Cheer up. Wangqing shrank\nback, clearly somewhat afraid of Muing.\nBut he kept muttering. You want me to\ncheer up? At least let me have a cup of\ncoffee. No. What if you can't sleep\nafter drinking coffee? Ching shook his\nhead repeatedly. No. I've learned a\nparticularly effective way to fall\nasleep. It makes me sleepy as soon as I\nuse it, so it definitely won't interfere\nwith my sleep. What method? Ching looked\ntroubled. He glanced at the aloof Mu\nLingi, thinking that she probably\nwouldn't understand. So he said, \"The\nairplane sleeping method.\" Mu Lings\nsneered. You plan to fall asleep in my\noffice this way by having me provide you\nwith my photos? Chapter 139. The seven\ndeadly sins meet. Ching blushed as red\nas a monkeykey's bottom and stammered\nfor a long time. Do do you have any more\nrevealing photos? Mu Lings remained\nsilent, staring at him expressionlessly.\nChing lowered his head further and\nfurther, almost burying it in his\ncrotch. It's almost time. Let's go to\nsleep. Oh. Quickly turned to lie on his\nside on the bed. But strangely, even\nthough he was so sleepy just now, he\ncouldn't fall asleep at all. Captain,\nCaptain, could you please stop looking\nat me? Mu Lingsy frowned deeply, grabbed\nXangqing by the collar, and lifted him\nup. You really plan to fall asleep like\nan airplane, huh? No. No. I'm used to\nbeing single, and I'm used to sleeping\nalone. I can't sleep when there are\npeople in the house, especially women.\nBang. Muing threwing back onto the bed\nand left without looking back, adding as\nshe went, \"If I find any strange smells\nin the office, you're dead.\" Zangqing\nwas so frightened that her face turned\npale and she immediately dismissed her\noriginal thought. He obediently lay on\nthe bed and started counting sheep.\nThere was no way around it. All his\ndrowsiness had been scared away by Mu\nLingsy. 101 102388.\nHe counted his face growing more and\nmore bitter. He couldn't sleep. He\nsimply couldn't sleep. He discovered\nthat people are just like that. When\nyou're not allowed to sleep, you can\nbarely keep your eyes open. But when\nyou're actually allowed to sleep, you\njust see a and fall asleep. As he\ncounted, he started to drift off. 554,\n556, 553. Oh dear, you already counted\nme once. A little white lamb hopped out\nfrom the flock and complained. Ching was\nstartled. Holy crap, why are they all\nsheep? He found himself in a sheepfold,\nsurrounded by pure white lambs. He shook\nhis head violently, only then realizing\nthat he had entered a dream. He was so\nengrossed in counting sheep that his\ndream was filled with sheep. With this\nthought in mind, he ignored the sheep\nand began searching through Sumu&lt;unk&gt;s\ndream. When Sumu was being investigated\nby the law enforcement bureau, Muingi\nhad already secretly intercepted a trace\nof his aura. Using this aura, quickly\nfound Sumu&lt;unk&gt;s dream. Then he\nswaggered into Sumu&lt;unk&gt;s dream, a task\nthat was already second nature to him.\nMuingi said that Sum Mu was the prime\nsuspect. After the investigation during\nthe day, he must have let his guard\ndown. So, she told her to enter his\ndreams at night to see if she could find\nany clues about his arrogance. She even\nsuspected that Sumu was arrogant. But\nthere was no evidence, just a gut\nfeeling. Jangqing remained completely\nunfaced. Even if Su Mu was arrogant, it\ndidn't matter. After all, it was a dream\nand everything in a dream was fake. Even\na gold level expert couldn't kill him in\na dream. And so he fearlessly plunged\ninto Su Mu&lt;unk&gt;s dream. The scene before\nmy eyes changed rapidly, and I was\ngreeted by an extremely prosperous\nmodern metropolis with bright lights and\nflashing neon signs, even more\nprosperous than the capital city.\nDangqing&lt;unk&gt;s eyes widened. He had\nentered many people's dreams, but this\nwas the first time he had ever seen such\na realistic dream. Previous dreams were\nlike virtual games, and each scene\nrequired loading. Due to the limited\ncomputing power of the human brain, most\nscenes were blurred, and only the places\nwhere the protagonist was located would\nappear real. But Sumu's dream was\ndifferent. Every blade of grass and\nevery tree, there was no different from\nreality. He suddenly realized that Sumu\nmight really be arrogant. Otherwise, how\ncould a second level bronze transcendent\nsupport such a realistic dream? My heart\nwas inexplicably racing like an ordinary\nperson who had accidentally discovered a\nbig shot secret. He suppressed the\npounding in his heart and search for Su\nMu's location. It was hard to find. In\nhis previous dreams, he only needed to\ngo to the clearest scene to find the\ndreams owner, but everything here was\nvery clear. However, this did not\nstumping. He randomly asked a passer by\non the street. Excuse me, do you know\nwhere Sumu is? The passerby was taken\naback. Who is Sumu? This time, Ching was\nstunned. It didn't make sense. Logically\nspeaking, everything in a dream is a\nmanifestation of the dreamer's\nsubconscious. So, asking a passerby for\ndirections is actually asking the\nsubconscious. Suddenly, Ching had a\nflash of inspiration and quickly changed\nhis question. Excuse me, do you know\nwhere Lord Arrogance is? The passerby\nsuddenly realized, \"You mean Lord\nArrogance? He's on the top floor of that\ntallest building.\" A look of joy flashed\nacross face as he clenched his fist.\nFantastic. I'm going to make a big\ncontribution this time. When we get\nback, the captain will definitely look\nat me in a new light, and maybe he'll\neven give me a revealing photo. He He\nhailed a taxi and headed straight for\nthe tallest skyscraper, which was over a\n100 m high, and almost pierced the\nclouds. He encountered no obstacles\nalong the way, and walked straight into\nthe building. He didn't find it strange\nat all. On the contrary, he thought it\nwas normal because people are usually\nunguarded in dreams, and it is also\ndifficult for them to realize that they\nare dreaming. bite. He boarded the\nelevator and rode it upwards for several\nminutes before it finally stopped. He\nswaggered into the top floor and\ndiscovered that it was a huge conference\nroom. Looking through the glass into the\nconference room, he was instantly taken\naback. In the large conference room,\nthere was a huge round table around\nwhich sat seven people. These seven\npeople were dressed in the same style of\ntailcoat. Their clothes were neat and\nsharp, and they were of different shapes\nand sizes, both men and women. And they\nall wore silver masks on their faces.\nThe silver mask was very strange. It had\nno patterns, only an expression, an\nexpression etched into the cold metal.\nAlthough the design was simple, it was\nremarkably lielike. By observing their\nexpressions, he could roughly determine\nthe emotions represented by each mask.\npride, rage, envy, greed, gluttony,\nlust, and sloth. The seven deadly sins.\nJangqing almost cried out in surprise.\nHe never expected to see the seven\ndeadly sins holding a meeting in Sumu's\ndream. He immediately realized that this\nwas a very important opportunity, and he\nmight be able to learn more about the\nSeven Deadly Sins organization from the\ncontent of the meeting. \"The nightmare\ngate is ready. All that's missing is the\nsacrifice,\" he said in a gruff, raspy\nvoice. His tone tinged with displeasure\nand anger. It was unclear who had\nprovoked him. As for the offerings, the\nnumber of living people in the entire\nStar City should be enough. If not, it's\nokay. This time, the capital sent many\nextraordinary individuals to Star City\nto search for us. The souls of\nextraordinary individuals are of very\nhigh quality, so with them, it should be\nenough. Jealousy was a short-haired\nwoman who was casually fiddling with her\nnewly done nails. The white nails are\ninlaid with tiny diamonds, making them\nvery delicate. Thump, thump. Ching&lt;unk&gt;s\nheart was pounding so hard he could\nhardly believe his ears. Was this the\nseven deadly sins? They were actually\nplanning to kill all the humans in Star\nCity, including the superhumans from the\ncapital. Didn't that include him? The\nnews was so explosive that his brain\nalmost went blank. Chapter 140. The\nseven deadly sins will overturn the\nentire world. Finally, this moment has\narrived. I can't wait to see the\nwonderful scene of the nightmare's\ndescent. This corrupt world needs a\ngreat cleansing. How weak the human body\nis. Only by fusing with nightmare\nmonsters can humanity's ultimate\nevolutionary direction be achieved. Is\nthere anything more perfect in this\nworld than nightmare creatures? They are\npowerful, existing between reality and\nillusion, defying lifespan limitations\nand possessing limitless potential.\nHumans have limits, but nightmares do\nnot. Greed was so excited that his body\ntrembled slightly. The next moment, a\nthick tentacle emerged from his body,\nwagging excitedly like a dog's tail. The\nsudden appearance of tentacles seemed to\nhave nothing to do with the crowd.\nGentlemen, the arrogant figure seated at\nthe head of the table suddenly spoke.\nYou are all pioneers of human\ncivilization. Although you are not yet\nunderstood by the world, when the gate\nof nightmare opens, decay will be\nbanished and new life will belong to\nevery human being who embraces\nevolution. May you all join me in this\nglorious evolution. As the arrogant and\ninspiring words resounded, the seven\ndeadly sins were completely agitated.\nChing, who was outside the conference\nroom, felt as if she had fallen into an\nice cave. These lunatics, they actually\nwant to use the power of nightmare\ncreatures to overthrow the entire world.\nThey're even more dangerous than the\nrevolutionary army. No, I must get this\nmessage out as soon as possible or it\nwill be too late. Wangqing trembled\nslightly, revealing his inner horror.\nWhile I was shocked and horrified, a\nsense of mission also arose in my heart.\nThe mission of a savior. He took a deep\nlook at the conference room and prepared\nto turn and leave. But then he suddenly\nrealized that the arrogance in the\nconference room was gone. He was\nhorrified. This was the dream of\narrogance. How could arrogance have\nsuddenly disappeared? The sudden turn of\nevents frightened him. He couldn't care\nless about pride anymore. The seven\ndeadly sins insane plan made him feel\nunsafe even in his dream. A group of\npeople who wanted to overthrow the\nworld. Even a fool could imagine how\nterrifying their power must be. Just as\nhe was about to turn and run away, a\nmocking voice suddenly rang out behind\nhim. Sir, what are you afraid of?\nJangqing was instantly shocked. He\nquickly turned around and saw a silver\nwhite smiling mask with a mocking smile\non its lips. His face turned deathly\npale. I I out of the corner of his eye,\nhe glanced at the conference room and\nnoticed that the other members of the\nseven deadly sins had all turned around\nand were staring straight at him. Looks\nlike a little mouse has infiltrated my\ndream. Arrogantly chuckled. Bronze loss\nsequence one. Dream journey. Who gave\nyou the courage to invade my dream? Do\nyou really think I can't do anything to\nyou in a dream? Have you ever considered\nwhy dream journey is considered the\nweakest sequence? At that moment, felt\nhis scalp explode, and he felt like he\nwas drowning, unable to breathe. He\nalmost instinctively turned and ran, not\ndaring to stop for a moment. They didn't\neven have the courage to turn around and\nsee if arrogance was chasing after them.\nAs arrogance said, dream journey is the\nweakest bronze law offering almost no\nbenefit to the body. This resulted in\nhis combat power being zero, his never\nhaving participated in any battles, and\nhis mental fortitude being extremely\npoor. Ching jumped out of the window,\nstanding 100 m in the air, frantically\nchanting, \"Return!\" in his mind. The\nnext moment, a blinding white light\nflashed before his eyes. When he opened\nhis eyes again, the bustling city was\ngone, replaced by an endless flock of\nsheep. Meow, meow, meow. The white lambs\nbleeded around him. Get out of here, all\nof you. Get out of here. I need to wake\nup quickly. Wake up, please. Ching was\nsweating profusely. He dared not delay\nfor a moment because he had been\ndiscovered by pride. Perhaps they had\nalready led the seven deadly sins to\nattack the enforcement bureau. He had to\npass on the message. Perhaps heaven\nrewards those who persevere, for the\nsurrounding sheep began to blur. Ching\nwas overjoyed, but his dream shattered\ninch by inch, and the ceiling of Mu\nLings office appeared before his eyes.\nTong. He sprang out of bed, his face\nfilled with anxiety, and was about to\nrun outside when the door suddenly\nopened. Mu Lingsy frowned as she looked\nat the panicked. How could you, Captain?\nThere's no time to explain. Take me to\nsee Lord Seong Xan immediately.\nSomething terrible has happened. Mu\nLings realized the seriousness of the\nsituation. What exactly happened? Did\nyou see something in Sumu&lt;unk&gt;s dream?\nCaptain, hurry. Otherwise, we&lt;unk&gt;ll be\ntoo late. Let's talk as we go. The two\nquickly left the house and headed\nstraight for Sungongjun&lt;unk&gt;s office.\nWhat exactly happened? Lord Sung Xan is\nresting. Unless it's something extremely\nurgent, you know the consequences of\ndisturbing him. Su is arrogant. What? Mu\nLingsy exclaimed in surprise. Are you\nsure? I'm sure.Qing shouted in a panic.\nI saw it with my own eyes in my dream.\nThere are seven people in the seven\ndeadly sins. They are all madmen. Their\ngoal is to open the gate to the\nnightmare world and let the nightmare\nmonsters invade reality. As they spoke,\nthe two arrived at Sikongs office.\nKnock-k knockock knock. Mu Lings kept\nknocking on the door, her fingers\nadorned with exquisite manicures bent\nand her knuckles striking the door\nframe. However, no one responded after\nknocking for a long time. Chin grew\nincreasingly anxious. Where is Lord\nSeong Jan at this hour? Captain, if\nnecessary, we should call Lord Seong\nXan. This matter concerns the lives of\nthe entire Star City and even the entire\nempire. Mu Lings nodded solemnly, took\nout her phone, and tapped away on her\nwhite diamond encrusted nail polish. No\none is answering. She continued trying\nto make the call. Calm down first. Tell\nme everything you know. Have you\nforgotten what I taught you? Stay calm\nin a crisis. Don't panic. The more you\npanic, the more likely you are to make a\nmistake. Chin forced himself to calm\ndown and began to recount everything he\nhad seen in a trembling voice. I saw the\nseven deadly sins having a meeting. I\ncouldn't see their faces clearly because\nthey were all wearing masks, but I do\nremember their builds. There were six\nmen and one woman, some of them muscular\nand some of them thin. The woman was\nvery slim with short hair and her hands\nwere At this point, Juangqing suddenly\nstopped, staring intently at Mu Lings\nhands as she tapped on her phone. Her\nhands were slender and long with\nexquisite manicures, the white nails\nstudded with tiny diamonds. The design\nis exactly the same as Envy, one of the\nseven deadly sins. In an instant, Ching\nwas enveloped by a silent terror. His\nhair stood on end, and he could barely\nbreathe. What else do you have in your\nhand? Muling asked. Thump, thump.\nChing&lt;unk&gt;s heart began to pound, but\nthe expression on his face gradually\ncooled down. And nothing. I can't\nremember clearly. Captain, you go and\ngather the team to find Lord Seong Xan.\nI'll make a statement and write down\neverything in my dream first because I'm\nafraid I'll forget it later. Chapter\n141. Because I am also one of the seven\ndeadly sins. Mulingsy looked up and\nsmiled inexplicably. She rarely smiled,\nbut when she did, she looked very\nbeautiful. However,\nonly felt fear. You're finally starting\nto look like a law enforcer. All right,\ngo ahead. Remember what I said. Stay\ncalm in any situation and don't panic.\nTry to recall the details of your dream.\nIf anything seems unusual, report it to\nme immediately. After saying that,\nMuingi left. Ching&lt;unk&gt;s back was almost\nsoaked with cold sweat, and he felt\ndizzy. Why, Captain? He stared at Mu\nLings departing figure, his eyes filled\nwith sorrow. The next moment, he shook\nhis head violently, his eyes hardening.\nWangqing, pull yourself together. We\nmust get the message to Lord Seong. No\nmatter what, we absolutely cannot let\nthe seven deadly sins plan succeed. He\nturned and walked into the dark\ncorridor, his figure gradually swallowed\nby the darkness like a lone warrior. On\nthe street, Chin drove at breakneck\nspeed, heading straight for Chian\nZahe&lt;unk&gt;s manor, guessing that this was\nthe most likely place for Sikong Xin to\nbe. Half an hour later, they arrived at\nChian Zahe&lt;unk&gt;s manner. Halt! Who goes\nthere? Two bodyguards and black blocked\nZhuangqing&lt;unk&gt;s path. Ching was\noverjoyed to see the two men as they\nwere subordinates brought by Seong Xan,\nor rather servants of the Seikkong\nfamily. \"I among from the law\nenforcement bureau. I came to Shingqing\nwith Lord Sikong Xan. We've met before.\nThis is my identification. I have\nimportant matters to report to Lord\nSeong Xan. He took out his\nidentification and handed it to the two\nmen for inspection. He was quickly\nallowed to pass. Anxious, Ching rushed\ninto the manor and saw Seongjan sitting\non the sofa in the hall. Sung Xan,\ndressed in gray pajamas, said with a\ncold expression, you'd better really\nhave something important to say.\nWongqing disregarded the other party's\ndissatisfaction and hurriedly told them\neverything he had seen, including the\nfact that Mu Lings was suspected of\nbeing jealousy, one of the seven deadly\nsins. To everyone's surprise, Seong Xan\nshowed no expression after hearing such\nexplosive news, as if he had heard\nsomething insignificant. Lord Siongjan,\nJangqing asked cautiously. You're saying\nCaptain Mu is one of the seven deadly\nsins. Envy? Sung Xan asked coldly.\nDwangqing nodded repeatedly, afraid that\nthe other party would not believe her\nand hurriedly explained. Jealousy has\nshort hair and white nail polish with\ndiamonds just like the captain, and\ntheir figures are almost identical. This\nis definitely not a coincidence.\nAlthough I don't want to believe it, the\nfacts tell me that the captain is\njealousy.\nSung Xan nodded, then suddenly asked\nfrom the darkness beside him. Captain\nMu, what do you think of this matter?\nCaptain Mu? Lingi slowly walking out\nfrom the dark corner, her expression\ncalm. Tongqing was so frightened that\nshe jumped up from the sofa and backed\naway. You You Lord Seong Xhan sees her.\nShe's just jealous. Sung Xan nor Mu\nLings moved, their expressions equally\ncalm. Mu Lings raised her hand, looked\nat her beautiful nails, and said with\nsome annoyance, \"I should have known\nbetter than to get my nails done. I\ndidn't expect to be found out.\" \"Lord\nSukongjhan, did you hear that?\" She\nadmitted it herself. She's just jealous.\nArrest her now. Wangqing was almost\nfrantic, fearing that Mu Lings would\nsuddenly attack and hurt someone. \"Yes,\nI know she is one of the seven deadly\nsins,\" See Kong Xan said calmly. Ching\nlooked utterly bewildered. \"Then why\nhaven't&lt;unk&gt; made a move yet?\" Suddenly,\nSikong slowly stood up, his tall figure\ncarrying an imposing aura, and stared at\nChing, saying slowly and deliberately,\n\"Because I am too.\" A thick tentacle\nextended from his body, its end wrapped\naround a silver mask with a greedy\nsmiling face, which finally pressed\nagainst Seongja&lt;unk&gt;s face. Mu Lings\nsmiled slightly, took out the jealousy\nmask, and put it on her face as well.\nThe two masks stared intently atqing.\nFear, a palpable fear that permeated my\nvery soul. Ching&lt;unk&gt;s body stiffened,\nhis eyes widened in horror. He could\nhardly believe his eyes and his throat\nfilled with fear could not utter a\nsingle word. Jealousy, should we kill\nhim? Sung Xan asked. Mu Lingsi shook her\nhead. Forget it. I quite like him. He's\na bit silly. Besides, a bronze tier one\ntranscendent is the weakest sequence\none. He's not even qualified to be a\nsacrifice. Let him go. Let him go.\nAren't you afraid he'll go around\ntelling everyone? Mu Lingsy chuckled.\nI'm the captain of the enforcement\nbureau's headquarters. What is he? She\ndidn't say anything more, but her silent\ncontempt was already self-evident.\nJangqing left the manor in a days. He\nhad no idea how he left or where he was\ngoing. He chuckled self-deprecatingly,\n\"So, I'm not even worth killing after\nall.\" As he spoke, he clenched his\nfists, veins bulging on his face. At\nthat moment, he even thought about\nreturning to the capital to tell the law\nenforcement bureau and the royal family\nabout the matter. But then he remembered\nMu Lings words. I'm the captain of the\nenforcement bureau. What is he? He\nreleased his fist weekly. Yeah, what am\nI? What am I worth? Who would believe\nme? Forget it. I'm tired. Let's destroy\nourselves. In the dream, Sumu sat on the\nthrone of the heavenly emperor, looking\nat Ching with a slight frown. At this\nmoment,&lt;unk&gt;s eyes were closed, and his\nexpression was sometimes ferocious and\nsometimes sad, as if he had a split\npersonality. Sigh, he sighed. Why did\nyou have to come in to deliver it? Sumu\nside. He never expected that someone\nwould dare to intrude into his dream.\nThe last person so brave was the\nprimordial angel. He sensing entering\nthe dream the moment he did and then\ncasually wo a small illusion for him.\nHis original plan was to wait for to\nwake up from this illusion, then weave\nanother illusion and then wake up again\nand weave another one and so on in a\ncycle. To put it simply, it's a dream\nwithin a dream. You think you've woken\nup from a dream, but in reality, you've\nentered a second dream. Then, when you\nwake up from the second dream, you\narrive at the third dream, and so on in\nan endless loop until a year later.\nBecause the duration of his dream can\nonly be controlled for one year, and he\ncan't extend it any further.\nUnexpectedly,\nwas so fragile that he suffered a mental\nbreakdown after only the second level of\nthe dream. This made Su Mu somewhat\ndissatisfied as he hadn't had enough fun\nyet. Fine, let's leave it at that. The\nnext moment, a massive surge of mental\nenergy flowed into Zhuangqing&lt;unk&gt;s\nbody, successfully hypnotizing him. Mu\nLings office,Qing opened his eyes,\nstretched, and called out, \"Captain, I'm\nready.\" Not long after, Muing walked in.\nLooking at Ching, who had a lazy\nexpression, she frowned and sniffed the\nroom. Finding no strange smell, her\nexpression softened slightly. \"What do\nyou mean by you're all better? Don't say\nsuch ambiguous things again. Ching&lt;unk&gt;s\nface fell. No. Captain, aren't you being\ntoo harsh on me? Can't I even say I'm\nfine? What's the ambiguity in that? You\nfigured it out yourself. Mu Lings opened\nthe gun holster at her waist, startling\ninto immediately shutting up. Did Su\ndiscover anything in his dream? No.\nChapter 142. I'm looking forward to it.\nWhat did he dream about? There's some\nnightmare monsters. He's fighting them\nin his dreams. Captain, let me tell you,\nthis kid is pretty freakish. He's\ndismembered a lot of nightmare monsters.\nThe scene was, \"Wow!\" Mu Lingsy fell\ninto thought. Had she dreamt of a\nnightmare monster? That was normal.\nNightmare apostles most often dreamt of\nnightmare monsters. These people entered\nthe nightmare world through dreams, so\nthey naturally resisted sleeping, and\nhaving nightmares was a common\noccurrence for them. \"Did you guide him\nin your dream?\" Ching nodded naturally.\n\"Of course, I guided him. I implanted a\nlot of information about the seven\ndeadly sins and pride into his dream.\nHis reaction was normal. In my opinion,\nthe theft of the golden eye and the\nkilling of Chinzaho are probably just\ncoincidences. An evil organization like\nthe seven deadly sins is not something\nthat a small place like Shingqing can\ncultivate. Muling was slightly dazed.\nWas her feeling wrong? Perhaps arrogance\nand Shing had no connection and were\njust passing through. Captain, you've\nbeen working all night. How about some\nlate night snack? Ching approached with\na grin. Go back to bed. Next, we&lt;unk&gt;ll\nenter Murong Mungly sd dream and\ninvestigate all these suspects. Huh?\nChing looked reluctant. Captain, I just\nwoke up. How can I fall asleep now?\nCould you give me a photo? Click. That\nwas the sound of a bullet being\nchambered. Looking at the dark muzzle of\nthe gun in front of him, Ching fell\nasleep immediately. I suddenly feel so\nsleepy. Captain, I'm going to sleep\nfirst. Muingi put away her pistol,\nturned around, and left. As she\nleft,Qing, who had been joking and\nlaughing, instantly became\nexpressionless, lying flat on the bed\nlike a robot and slowly closing her\neyes. 3 days later, in the newly\nestablished headquarters of the Viper\ngang in the lower city, Sumu was quietly\nlistening to a record called I Expect.\nThe record player's wooden base has\nnatural grain and a warm luster. The\nslender tone arm acts like a flexible\nconductor's batten, transforming the\ntexture of the record into a beautiful\nfemale voice. The woman's voice was\nclear and ethereal, like that of a young\ngirl in the throws of first love, slowly\nnarrating her beautiful expectations for\nthe future and for love. A gentle breeze\ncaresses the sea of flowers. Sunlight\nspills onto the hem of a skirt. The\ndream of springtime is like a vibrant\npainting filled with anticipation for\nthe future. I look forward to a bright\nfuture. My dreams shining brightly in\nthe distance. I long for love to arrive\nlike stars illuminating my heart. I hope\nit will always feel like the first time\nI met you. I look forward to the Holly's\nverdant green reflecting the light of\ntime. I look forward to your\nexpectations. Did you hear that? My name\nYong Donging shouted excitedly from the\nside. This is the song Jasmine wrote for\nme. Before the ethereal female voice in\nthe album had even finished, Yong\nDoning&lt;unk&gt;s scream instantly shattered\nthe beautiful anticipation in the music.\nLet me tell you, this song is super\npopular now. Jasmine is going to be a\nbig star. He was so happy, even happier\nthan if he were a star himself. Sumu\nlooked at Yong Doning, who was yelling\nand shouting like a gorilla, and felt a\nheadache coming on. You came all this\nway just to give me this record to show\noff that Jasmine wrote a song for you.\nHow could that be? I'm not that bored. I\ncame here mainly to tell you that I feel\nthe next nightmare world is approaching\nand I've been a little uneasy these past\nfew days. Yang Donging&lt;unk&gt;s excited\nexpression cooled slightly when he\nmentioned the nightmare world. This\npiqued Sumu&lt;unk&gt;s interest. Was it\nfinally coming? He had been bored for 3\ndays. The arrival of the gold level\npowerhouse made the entire star city\nfeel incredibly oppressive. All\nundercurrents ceased and no one wanted\nto cause unnecessary trouble at this\nsensitive time. This made Sue move very\nbored. But the summons from the\nnightmare world piqued his interest.\nActually, if he could, he wouldn't want\nto rely on other people's nightmare\nsummoning. Mainly because he himself has\nnever felt the call of the nightmare\nworld. Possibly because he goes there\ntoo frequently. Every time before they\nwere even drafted, they would volunteer\nto join. You can rest at the Viper Gangs\nplace for the next few nights and wait\nfor the nightmare world to arrive. Young\nDoning nodded. This was exactly why he\nhad come. To be honest, no one wanted to\nface the nightmare world alone. in\nTing&lt;unk&gt;s nightmare last time. If it\nweren't for Su Mu&lt;unk&gt;s presence, he\ncertainly wouldn't have survived.\nUnderstood. I'll stay with Jasmine\nduring the day and go back to the Viper\ngang tonight. With that, Yong Doning got\nup and left to find Jasmine. Sumu shook\nhis head helplessly. How could such a\nsuperhum have developed such a love\nstruck mind? Shing law enforcement\nbureau. Mu Lingsy looked serious, her\nbrows furrowed as she pondered the clues\nshe had gathered. Captain, I've invaded\nthe dreams of all these main suspects,\nand they have no connection to the seven\ndeadly sins. What do we do next?\"\nWangqing asked, yawning with huge dark\ncircles under his eyes. Mooling did not\nrespond. Her brows furrowed deeper and\ndeeper. Things were in trouble now. She\ncould not find any clues in Shing. How\nwas she going to explain this to the\nEmpire? There hadn't been a heinous\nincident of a noble being killed in\ndecades. Now that one had occurred,\nthere was no clue whatsoever. The\ncapital was already very dissatisfied at\nthis moment. Si Kongjan, who was sitting\nto the side drinking tea, suddenly spoke\nup. Since we can't find any clues using\nconventional methods, we can only rely\non unconventional methods. What do you\nmean? To foresee the future, Sung Xan\nuttered softly. Mu Lings was taken\naback. Bronze law sequence 241,\nprecognition, hasn't appeared for over a\ndecade. Does Lord Seekong know where\nthere are extraordinary individuals who\ncan foresee the future? Sikong slowly\nshook his head. Although I don't know\nwhere the superhumans who can predict\nthe future are, I know there are other\nmethods that can achieve a similar\neffect, such as divination.\nFortuneelling, Mu Lings pondered for a\nmoment. Then, as if she had thought of\nsomething, she blurted out, \"Chong Shan\nDao Temple, Master Shianing. Indeed, it\nis Daist Xian. But Master Shinshing\ntravels far and wide with no fixed\nabode. He only stays in one place for a\nyear at a time. It would be difficult to\nfind him now. Sung Xan smiled slightly.\nThere&lt;unk&gt;'s no need to search for it\ndeliberately. Daist Shian just happened\nto be traveling to Shing this time. Mu\nLings face lit up with joy. Is it in\nShingqing? That's perfect. I've long\nheard that Master Shinshing is an\nextraordinary person, proficient in\ndivination with effects comparable to\npredicting the future. When he traveled\nto the capital, he was even summoned by\nthe royal family. If he lends his help,\nfinding clues to the seven deadly sins\nwon't be difficult. Let's go see Master\nShinqing. Sung Xan stood up and stroed\nout of the conference room. Chapter 143.\nThe temple of longevity in the suburbs\nof Shingqing. Far from the hustle and\nbustle, a simple and ancient Tauist\ntemple stands quietly. The vermilion\ngate is very new. The blue green tiled\nroof is layered and the auspicious bee\nsculptures on the roof ridge stand tall\nas if it had only been built recently.\nAbove the main gate hangs an ancient\nstyle plaque with four large characters.\nChongqing Tauist Temple. See Kong Xan\nand Mu Lingsy stepped into the Chongqing\nTauist Temple. Walking on the blue stone\nslabs in the courtyard, a handsome\nTauist priest was lazily sitting at a\nstone table playing on his phone. He\nseemed to have seen something\ninteresting and kept making laughs that\nonly men would understand. So much so\nthat no one from the temple noticed him.\nMu Lings stepped forward. Excuse me,\nDaist Master Shianing. Is he here? Jun\nWu Shang was startled as if he had been\ncaught in the act of adultery. He\nhurriedly locked his phone, then looked\nup and froze, staring blankly at Mu\nLings in front of him. She was dressed\nin a black tight leather outfit and tall\nboots which outlined her graceful figure\nand slender legs. Mu Lings remained\nexpressionless and continued to ask, \"Is\nDaist Shinshing here?\" Jun Wu Shang then\ncame to his senses and nodded like a\nchick pecking at rice. \"Yes, yes, master\nis in the main hall.\" Muing nodded and\nthen she and Sung Xan walked towards the\nmain hall. Jun Wu Shang s eyes were\npractically popping out as he kept\nscanning the other person's long\nstraight legs. Holy crap, those legs are\neven more upright than my character.\nSikong Xan and his companion entered the\nmain hall where they were greeted by an\nancient and grand altar that occupied\nalmost 1/5if of the hall. What was\nstrange was that on such a large altar\nwas a miniature statue of a god less\nthan 20 cm tall. The statue was\nhuman-shaped, made of clay, and painted\nwith cheap paint with many cracks\nalready visible. Beside the altar, an\nold towist priest with a sage-like\nappearance, and a full head of white\nhair sat cross-legged before the statue\nof the deity, his back to the two of\nthem as if in deep meditation. Two wisps\nof green smoke rose in front of him,\nspreading out and adding to the ethereal\natmosphere. \"Master Shianing, it has\nbeen 5 years since we parted in the\ncapital,\" Siongjan said with a hearty\nlaugh, as if he were seeing an old\nfriend he hadn't seen for many years.\nThe towist master Shianing with his\notherworldly air slowly turned around\nrevealing a face covered with age spots.\nSo it's layman Seong. This humble Tauist\nSwan King greets you. Sikong Xan and the\nother man looked at Shianqing who seemed\nlike a highly accomplished Tauist master\nwith strange expressions on their faces.\nShinqing noticed their gazes and without\nmaking a sound wiped the drool from the\ncorner of his mouth with his wide Tauist\nrobe as if nothing had happened. he said\ninscraably. I wonder what brings layman\nSee Kong here today. If it is to\npersuade me to return to the capital,\nthen I will not waste my breath.\nThroughout my life, I have believed in\nthe celestial venerable of longevity,\nand I aspire to travel the world to\nexpand the lineage of the Dao of\nlongevity. I cannot remain confined to\none place. Sungan seemed to have\nanticipated that Master Shinshing would\nsay this and did not care. Instead, he\nwent straight to the point and said,\n\"Master, you misunderstand. I came here\nmainly to ask you to help me with the\ndivination. I'm sure you've heard that\nnot long ago, an organization called the\nSeven Deadly Sins, appeared in Shing.\nThe leader of the Seven Deadly Sins,\nPride, even killed an Imperial nobleman\nin full view of everyone. This matter\nhas enraged the entire Crimson Flame\nEmpire, which is why they sent me to\ninvestigate. The case has now reached a\nbottleneck. So I would like to ask for\nyour assistance, Dowist Master. Faced\nwith the request from a gold level\nexpert, Master Shinshqing unexpectedly\nshook his head. I stopped telling\nfortunes many years ago. Please leave\nlayman. Mu Lings frowned slightly. Dais\nShianqing. The seven deadly sins are\nextremely heinous. The royal family has\nissued a death order to bring them to\njustice. I beg you to lend a hand. Both\nthe heinous crimes and the royal family\nwere cited as reasons for her to\npressure Shinshqing by invoking both\nmorality and imperial power. Master\nShianing remained calm and composed\ninstead asking in return, \"Lady, how old\ndo you think I am?\" Muing was somewhat\npuzzled, but still replied. Judging from\nthe Tauist priests appearance, he should\nbe 80 years old. Master Shinshing\nstroked his white beard and laughed. Too\nhigh. 70. Master Shianing smiled and\nshook his head. Mu Lingi raised an\neyebrow. 60. She didn't expect that\nMaster Shinshing would look so old. She\nhad just said 80, which was an\nunderstatement. Judging from his\nappearance, people would believe he was\n100. Unexpectedly, Master Shinshing\ncontinued to shake his head. It's still\ntoo high. Mu Lingsy was somewhat\nsurprised. 50. 49. Master Shinshing\nstated his age. Seeing the doubt on Mu\nLings s face, he explained.\nFortunetelling is revealing heavenly\nsecrets and will shorten one's lifespan.\nI am the best example. I am only 49\nyears old, but I look like a cinarian.\nSo, it's not that I don't want to help\nyou, but that I am willing but unable to\ndo so. This Mui didn't know what to say\nfor a moment. She couldn't very well ask\nsomeone to risk their life for\nfortunetelling. Although she had never\nmet Master Shianing, she had heard the\nlegends of this extraordinary person in\nthe capital. Being summoned by the royal\nfamily and sought after by countless\nnobles, such a person would not be\nafraid of threats. Sung Xin seemed\nunfazed by this and said directly,\n\"Tauist Master, name your price.\" Master\nShinshing immediately displayed agility\nbeyond his years, quickly holding up one\nfinger. 100 million. Mu Lings. Sung Xan\nnodded calmly. Okay, I haven't finished\nyet. 100 million plus a supernatural\nmaterial. Eight leaf Phoenix orchid. Pay\nfirst then deliver. Also, if I can't\ncalculate it, the money will not be\nrefunded. Master Shianing rattled off a\nseries of demands like a machine gun.\nMooling. If it weren't for the\ncertification from Sung Xan, a gold\nlevel expert, she would have seriously\ndoubted that the Tauist Master Shining\nin front of her was a fraud. All right,\nI'll go back and prepare. I'll bring the\nmoney and the eightleaf orchid at this\ntime tomorrow. I'll trouble you then,\nDaist Master. Sukong Xhin said calmly,\nthen left with Mui. As soon as they left\nthe Tauist Temple, Muingi couldn't help\nbut ask, Lord Seong, isn't 100 million a\nbit too much. Besides that 8 Phoenix\nOrchid is extremely rare. If you hadn't\nmentioned the royal family's strict\norder, perhaps 10 million would have\nbeen enough. Mu Lingsy was speechless\nagain. She had lost count of how many\ntimes she had been speechless. It turned\nout that this damned old Tauist priest\nwas raising prices on the spot. The more\nanxious you were, the higher his price\nwould go. As long as we can catch the\nseven deadly sins. Any sacrifice is\nworthwhile. By the way, let the\nenforcement bureau reimburse this money.\nJust 200 million, Sungan said casually\nas if he were talking about a trivial\nmatter. Mu lings. Chapter 144. I will\nbecome the god of the new era. Master.\nMaster. Who is that girl just now? What\ndoes she want with you? Jun Wuang rushed\ninto the main hall impatiently. Master\nXian glanced at him and said casually.\nNaturally, I came here because of your\nreputation. Master, you're just\nbragging. Chongqing Tao's temple has\nbeen open in Shingqing for almost a\nyear, and this is the first time we've\nhad guests who have come all this way\nbecause of our reputation. You don't\nknow anything. Didn't I tell you long\nago that back when I was a powerful\nfigure in the capital, even members of\nthe royal family had to respectfully\naddress me as daist master and the\nnobles below would do anything to see\nme. Yes, yes, master, you're the best at\nbragging. Jun Wuang was clearly tired of\nhearing these words. You unfil disciple.\nDaist Shian roared in fury. I was even\nthinking of getting you a set of\nextraordinary materials for this sword\nheart clarity technique. And you dare to\ndoubt me? You're asking for a beating.\nMaster Shian kicked Jun Wu Shang in the\nbutt, sending him flying against the\nwall. Ouch. Jun Wuang rubbed his\nbuttocks, his face full of anger. You\nold bastard. You've got your bragging\nexposed, so you resort to violence, huh?\nMake your own lunch today. I'm not\nserving you anymore. Faced with Jun Wu\nShang s threat, Master Shining\nnonchalantly reached into his sleeve and\nthen tossed out a hundred yuan coin.\nDisciple. One shouldn't let pride and\nmoney cause trouble, don't you think?\nJun Wuang glanced disdainfully at the\nhundred yuan bill lying on the ground.\nDo you think I'm still as easy to fool\nas before? 100 yuan for four dishes and\na soup a week. Let me tell you, I've\njoined the Bronze Coffin company and am\nhighly regarded by the boss. Even the\ndepartment heads at Bronze Coffin call\nme brother. Do you know how much I earn\na month? Whoosh. The old towist priest\nXian threw out another 100 yuan bill.\n200. That's the most I can do. Jun Wu\nShan was furious, feeling his dignity\nhad been trampled on. 300, not a penny\nless. The next day, Sikong Xan and Mu\nLingsi came to visit again, bringing a\nbank card and an orchid with eight sharp\nleaves. Each leaf gleaming with a cold\nlight as if it could cut through steel.\nThe old Tauist priest, Shiining, smiled\nlike a blooming chrysanthemum, and\nwarmly welcomed the two in, even\noffering them tea. This was the service\nprovided after payment. Master\nShianqing, thank you for your trouble,\"\nSiong Xhan said calmly. The old Tauist\nShining waved his hands repeatedly, his\nface serious. \"Oh, no trouble at all.\nWhat does it matter if I live a few\nyears less to help the empire?\" Sung Xen\ndidn't care about the other party's\nchange of expression. He only cared\nabout the result. Master Shinshing began\nto bathe and burn incense. He first went\nback to his room and took a bath for an\nhour. Then changed into a clean tauist\nrobe, put on a black towist crown, and\nrespectfully lit three incense sticks\nfor the miniature statue of the\ncelestial venerable of longevity. As the\nwisps of smoke rose, he began to tell\nfortunes. An ancient copper coin sword\nappeared in his hand. He chanted an\nunknown incantation, his figure moving\nwith the wind. While wielding the sword,\nhe took out a stack of yellow talismans\nfrom his pocket and scattered them into\nthe air. This charlatan's act made Mu\nLingsy frown. It wasn't just like a\ncharlatan. It was downright charlatanic.\nShe even suspected that Master Shining\nhad learned his fortune-telling\ntechniques from some trashy TV dramas as\nthey were exactly the same. Is it time\nfor it to breathe fire next? Sure\nenough, Master Shinshing took out the\nred gourd from his waist, took a sip,\nand then sprayed it onto the candles on\nthe wooden table. Boom! A large ball of\nflame appeared, scorching the\nsurrounding air. Some fallen yellow\ntalismans were ignited by the flames,\ncreating a spectacular scene. As luck\nwould have it, a lit yellow talisman\nlanded right on the head of the statue\nof the celestial venerable of longevity,\ncarried by a gentle breeze. Holy crap,\nheavenly venerable. Master\nSchwaning&lt;unk&gt;s expression changed\ndrastically. He rushed over to put out\nthe fire for the celestial venerable of\nlongevity. The fire was quickly\nextinguished, but the celestial\nvenerable of longevity also became\ncovered in soot. Please forgive me,\nheavenly venerable. Please forgive me.\nHe nervously wiped the statue of the\nheavenly venerable with his sleeve,\nwiping it for a long time and even\nwiping off a piece of red paint from the\nstatue. Uh, heavenly venerable one. No,\nno, no. Please don't peel off the paint.\nMulings was completely speechless. She\nlooked at Seong Xan and noticed that\nbeneath his calm expression, the corners\nof his mouth were twitching. Master, are\nyou still not done calculating? She\ncouldn't help but urge him on. As a\nresult, he was met with a glare from\nMaster Shinshing. What's all the noise\nabout? Can't you see the heavenly\nvenerable is angry? He touched up the\npaint and performed numerous\nprostrations and cows, working for half\nan hour before finally getting back on\ntrack. The old towist Shian knelt before\nthe celestial venerable of longevity bit\nhis finger and dripped a drop of blood\nonto the statue. Disciple Shinshing\nrespectfully requests the celestial\nvenerable to display his divine powers.\nWhoosh! The statue of the celestial\nvenerable of longevity suddenly burst\nforth with a strange blue light, forming\nan image in midair like a projection.\nThe image trembled like ripples on water\nand gradually became clearer. Mu Lingsy\nwas stunned. So, this is what\nfortune-telling is all about. Invoking a\ndeity to perform supernatural powers.\nThen what were you doing? All that\nbathing, burning incense, and dancing\nbefore. It's just an add-on service,\nmaking us feel that spending 100 million\nis worthwhile. The image in midair\nbecame clearer, and Shinshing\nLaauo&lt;unk&gt;s face aged several years at a\nvisible speed. It was because of seeing\nthis scene that Mu Lingsy gave up her\nplan to get the 100 million back\nafterward. \"This is the seven deadly\nsins,\" Mu Lingsy exclaimed softly, her\neyes fixed on the scene in midair. The\nscene had now fully formed, showing\nseven men and women dressed in tail\ncoats. They had different figures, some\ntall and slender, others muscular and\nrobust. The only thing they had in\ncommon was that they all wore identical\nsilver masks. The screen zoomed in\nagain, and the group was able to see the\nscene clearly. Dark clouds filled the\nsky, lightning flashed, and thunder\nroared. The earth cracked, mountains\ncollapsed, and once prosperous cities\nwere reduced to ruins. Fire light\nflickered in the ruins, mercilessly\ndevouring everything. And the whole\nworld seemed to be plunged into endless\ndarkness and despair. In this shattered\nworld, seven men and women dressed in\ntailcoats and wearing silver masks stood\nproudly at top the ruins, as if they\nwere the masters of all things. The\narrogant leader slightly raised his\nchin, his disdainful gaze watching the\ndestruction of the world. Muling gasped.\nSiong Xan&lt;unk&gt;s brows were already\nfurrowed. The screen began to flash\nrapidly, and more and more things\nappeared on the screen. They saw\ncountless severed limbs and remains, the\ncollapse of the empire, and the\ndestruction of human civilization.\nLadies and gentlemen, the old era has\nended, and the new era is about to\nbegin. An arrogant voice rang out from\nthe screen. He stood at the pinnacle,\nseemingly with the whole world beneath\nhis feet, as if declaring to the world,\n\"And I will become the god of the new\nera.\" His calm words contained a deep\narrogance, an arrogance that transcends\nall living beings and belongs only to\nthe gods. Chapter 145. The seven deadly\nsins of the future. Lust. Master\nShinshing. What exactly is going on?\nSung Xan was also unsettled. He knew\nMaster Shinshing smethods. Although the\nother party seemed unreliable, he might\nhave gained the approval of the royal\nfamily and actually possessed real\nskills. Master Shinshing? Master\nShinshing didn't reply. He stared at the\nscene in midair with a horrified\nexpression. So much so that he sat down\non the ground with a thud. The world\nwill be destroyed. The world will be\ndestroyed. The world will perish because\nof the seven deadly sins. What? Sung Xan\nand Mu Lings exclaimed at the same time,\ntheir faces full of disbelief. They\nnever imagined that a fortune telling\nwould predict such a shocking future.\nWhile the two were shocked, neither of\nthem noticed the abnormality of Master\nShianing. If they had looked closely,\nthey would have found that Master\nSchwaning&lt;unk&gt;s eyes were fixed on one\nof the seven deadly sins, lust. It was a\nleerous silver white mask that concealed\nthe person's face. The person's long,\nflowing hair was tied up with a simple\nribbon, and a long sword was strapped to\ntheir back. The whole thing was\nextremely blurry, as if it had been\ncovered with a mosaic. It was so blurry\nthat even the person's own mother would\nhave to spend an hour trying to figure\nit out. Master Shinshing seemed to\nrecognize the other party, his eyes\nfilled with unparalleled shock. \"This\nshamelessness is unmistakable.\nAbsolutely unmistakable.\" \"Holy crap, my\ngood disciple. If I had known you'd be\nthis awesome in the future, I wouldn't\nhave kicked your butt,\" he thought\nregretfully. \"Dowist master, do you mean\nthat the seven deadly sins will destroy\nthe world in the future?\" Sung Xan asked\nurgently, a look of worry appearing on\nthe face of this gold level expert for\nthe first time. \"How would I know? Isn't\nthis a vision of the future right here?\nSee for yourselves. See Kong Xhan&lt;unk&gt;s\nface was ashen. Although he was\nunwilling to believe it, he believed in\nMaster Shining s abilities. Back when\nMaster Shining was in the capital, he\nhad calculated everything perfectly and\nnever made a mistake. Master, I remember\nyou once said that the future is not\nimmutable. Quickly count who the members\nof the seven deadly sins are. Even if\nthe world is destroyed, it is still a\nmatter for the future. Now, as long as\nwe know their true identities, we may\nnot be unable to stop it. There are\nseven of them in total. How could I\npossibly have that many lifespans to\ncount all seven at once? Master\nShinshing said, his eyes gleaming.\nArrogance, Mu Lings said coldly. He is\nthe leader of the seven deadly sins.\nIt's&lt;unk&gt; enough to figure out who he\nis. Master Shinshin gritted his teeth,\nlooked at the man in the picture wearing\na black tuxedo, a top hat, and a silver\nsmiley face mask, and silently began to\nform hand seals. But then a shocking\nchange occurred. The arrogant figure in\nthe scene slowly turned his head, and\nhis mocking silver mask came into view\nas if he were silently mocking everyone.\nEveryone was startled. At that moment,\nthey had the illusion that arrogance was\nwatching them. That disdainful gaze\nseemed to cross the gap of time, casting\na line from the future to the past. The\nold tauist priest, Shiqing, suddenly\ncoughed up a mouthful of blood, his face\nas white as paper, his expression\nhorrified.\nHe discovered me. Oh. An arrogant\nchuckle echoed in the video. Mere people\nof the old era daring to pry into the\ngods of the new era. Bang! The screen\nshattered and all sound and strange\nphenomena abruptly ceased. The entire\nhall was deathly silent. The three of\nthem stared at each other in horror.\nSuch a bizarre scene made their scalps\ntingle. They had never imagined that\nthere could be someone in this world who\ncould communicate with the past from the\nfuture. This is impossible. Master\nShianing suddenly roared, breaking the\nsilence in the room. His expression was\nferocious. I borrowed the power of the\neternal life celestial venerable to\ndivine the future. How can he see the\npast through the future? Is he stronger\nthan the eternal life celestial\nvenerable? No one could answer his\nquestion. The celestial venerable of\nlongevity is the greatest deity. How\ncould there possibly be an existence in\nthis world that surpasses the celestial\nvenerable of longevity? Master Shianing,\ncould you please calculate the\nidentities of the seven deadly sins\nagain? If pride doesn't work, could you\ncalculate the identities of the others?\nThe empire is willing to offer another\n100 million, Sikcom Jan said in a deep\nvoice. Upon hearing the names of the\nothers, Master Shianing regained some\ncomposure and directly refused, saying,\n\"This is not about money. Do you think\nI'm some kind of street charlatan who\ncan just open my mouth and tell\nfortunes? This time, my fortune telling\nbackfired, and I simply can't do it\nagain for a while.\" I understand. Sungan\nnodded absent-mindedly. Without any\nformalities, he led Mu Lings away from\nthe Chongqing Tauist Temple. Lord Seong,\ndo you really believe in the future this\nold charlatan predicted? And what about\nthe celestial venerable of immortality\nhe worships? There are no gods in this\nworld. I guess he just possesses some\nunknown laws. Mu Lingsy was clearly\nskeptical. She didn't believe that the\nworld could be destroyed by the power of\njust seven people. Even if these seven\npeople are all gold level experts, it\nwon't work. You have to know that there\nare seven empires in this world and the\nCrimson Flame Empire is just one of them\nand it's not even ranked high. Even so,\nthe seven gold level powerhouses\ncouldn't even overthrow the Crimson\nFlame Empire, so how could they possibly\ndestroy the world? Sung Xan shook his\nhead. There really are gods in this\nworld. Mu Lingsy was stunned. She didn't\nexpect that See Kong Xan, a gold-level\nexpert, would say such a thing. In her\nunderstanding, so-called gods were just\nmore powerful people. In the past, when\ninformation was not readily available,\nsome gold level experts were mistaken\nfor gods. Sir, have you ever seen a\ndeity? You've misunderstood. The god I'm\ntalking about isn't the god you imagine,\nbut a nightmare monster. Mu Lingsy\nunderstood immediately and came up with\nthe answer right away. You mean gods are\nalso products of the nightmare world?\nSung nodded. If people can dream of\nmonsters, why can't they dream of gods?\nIt's normal for some fanatical believers\nto dream of their own gods at night. The\nfact that so many fanatical believers\ndream of the same god has resulted in\nmost of the gods in the nightmare world\nbecoming unprecedentedly powerful, far\nsurpassing ordinary nightmare monsters.\nMuingi pondered. So that's how it is.\nThe credibility of the future visions\ncreated by the celestial venerable of\nimmortality is questionable. No. See\nJan&lt;unk&gt;s expression gradually turns\nserious. We cannot doubt it. On the\ncontrary, it is highly credible. Didn't\nI just say that these so-called gods are\nall very powerful and possess all kinds\nof magical abilities? In other words,\nthe future scenes predicted by the\neternal life celestial venerable are\neven more credible than those of\nsuperhumans who can predict the future.\nMuings was shocked. She found it hard to\naccept the news that the seven deadly\nsins would destroy the world in such a\nshort time. Then what should we do next?\nSikong Xen slowly looked up at the sky\nand said solemnly, \"I need to go back to\nthe capital and report this matter to\nthe royal family.\" \"The Seven Deadly\nSins organization is probably more\npowerful than I imagined. This is no\nlonger something that I, a gold level\nsuperhum, can handle.\" Chapter 146. The\nperson, the Celestial Venerable of\nImmortality, has been searching for.\nImpossible. Absolutely impossible. Daist\nShianshin collapsed madly in the main\nhall, repeatedly exclaiming. The\ncelestial venerable of longevity is\nomnipotent. How could anyone in this\nworld possibly see through his divine\npowers? I understand. Master Shinshing\nsuddenly shouted excitedly. Only he\nhimself can see through the divine\npowers of the eternal life celestial\nvenerable. Therefore, Aommen and I are\nalso believers of the eternal life\ncelestial venerable. I use the power of\nthe eternal life celestial venerable to\nglimpse his future self while he uses\nthe power of the eternal life celestial\nvenerable to communicate with me in the\npresent. That must be it. After all, my\nwicked disciple is lust, one of the\nseven deadly sins. So, it makes even\nmore sense when you think about it that\nway. Haha. After grasping the key point,\nMaster Shinshing felt refreshed and\ninvigorated. In his view, whether the\nworld was destroyed or not was not\nimportant. What was important was that\nthe celestial venerable of longevity\nmust be omnipotent. In the empty hall,\nhe danced wildly like a madman, circling\nthe statue of the celestial venerable of\nlongevity. Then he suddenly stopped. He\nbecame extremely excited, almost lying\non the body of the celestial venerable\nof immortality. His expression\nfanatical. You mean arrogance is the\nperson you've been searching for? Yes.\nYes. I will certainly bring arrogance\nbefore you. The only sound in the entire\nhall was the madman s voice. Before\nlong, he started gesturing wildly again.\nNight fell quickly, and Jun Wu Shang,\nwho had been out having fun all day,\nreturned to the Chongqing Tauist Temple.\nAs soon as he entered, he smelled the\naroma of meat. When he entered the main\nhall, he saw the old towist Shiining\nsitting at the table, his old face\nsmiling like a blooming chrysanthemum,\nand the table was full of sumptuous\nfood. My dear disciple, you must be\ntired after a long day. Your master has\nprepared dinner. Come and eat. Jun Wuang\nimmediately became wary. Old Deng, what\ntrick are you up to now? Did you drug me\nand plan to steal the 300 yuan you gave\nme yesterday after I fall asleep? Let me\ntell you the truth. I've already spent\nall 300. Forget about it. A vein bulged\non Master Shinshing as forehead, but he\nstill forced a kind smile on his face.\nMy good disciple, you've been naughty\nagain. How could your master do such a\nthing? I just felt that you had worked\nhard all day, so I specially prepared a\ntable of good dishes to help you\nrecover. As he spoke, he took out a\nbottle of dark green potion and placed\nit on the table. This is the\nextraordinary potion of sword heart\nclarity. I just made it. Drink it while\nit's hot. With it, you can advance to\nthe second rank of bronze, and peerless\nsword dance will be able to unleash its\ntrue power. Master Shinshing s overtures\nmade Jun Wuang even more wary and he\neven took a step back and stepped out\nthe door. If someone is being unusually\nhelpful, they must have ulterior\nmotives. Did you discover that I stole\nmoney from the donation box, so you're\nplanning to mess with me? What? You even\nstole from the donation box? Another\nvein appeared on Master Schwaning&lt;unk&gt;s\nforehead. He took a deep breath,\nsuppressed his anger, and continued to\nsay kindly, \"It's all right. Just take\nit.\" The eternal life celestial\nvenerable is the most benevolent and\nmagnanimous deity in the world. He won't\nblame you. Come and eat. I won't eat it\nunless you tell me your real purpose.\nHave I been too kind to you, Master\nShinshing? He finally lost his temper\nand roared. Come and eat, TCH. Jun Wuang\nsnorted disdainfully, then stroed into\nthe main hall, sat down, and began to\neat. Why didn't you say so earlier? You\nson of a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Master Shinshing\nsuppressed the urge to kick Jun Wuang,\nsilently chanting in his heart. Don't\nget angry. Don't get angry. This kid is\ngoing to be the lust of the seven deadly\nsins in the future. He's going to be\nawesome. I'll be counting on him to take\ncare of me in my old age. Speak. What is\nit? Let's get this straight. No money\ninvolved. Jun Wuang mumbled, eating a\nchicken leg. Ahem. Master Shinshing\ncleared his throat. Today, a very joyous\nevent has occurred. Are they\ndistributing eggs in the city? Screw\nyou. Bang. Master Shianing finally\ncouldn't hold back and kicked Jun Wuang\naway. What I'm talking about is a great\njoy. What's so great about giving out\neggs? At most, it's a small joy. Listen\ncarefully. This great joy is the thing\nthat the celestial venerable of\nlongevity has been searching for has\nbeen found. Oh. Jun Wuang rubbed his\nbottom, got up from the ground, and\ncontinued eating. What kind of attitude\nis this? Didn't you hear what I said?\nEternal life, celestial venerable. I\nheard you. I heard you. So, the thing\nwas found. If you ask me, you should go\nto the psychiatric department of the\nhospital and get your auditory\nhallucinations treated. Otherwise,\nyou'll be chatting with the idol every\nday. I am blessed with good fortune to\nbe able to listen to the teachings of\nthe celestial venerable of longevity.\nYou know nothing. All right. All right.\nI don't understand. What is it that the\ncelestial venerable of longevity has\nbeen searching for? I remember you said\nbefore that the reason you traveled\naround and stayed in one place for a\nyear was to find this thing. When asked\nwhat you were looking for, you couldn't\ngive a clear answer. You said it could\nbe a person, it could be an object, it\ncould have a physical form, or it could\nnot. Master Shinshing smiled\nmysteriously. Now I've confirmed it.\nIt's a human. Who? We don't know yet.\nJun Wu Shang put down his chopsticks,\nreached out and touched Shinqing Dao's\nforehead and said, \"Seriously, master,\nI'll take you to the hospital to\nregister tomorrow. This mental illness\nreally can't be delayed any longer. You\ndon't even know who you are. What are\nyou happy about? Your mental health is\nreally in trouble.\" Master Shinshing\nsmiled and shook his head. \"My spirits\nare excellent. I have never been so\ngood. Although I do not know who that\nperson is, you certainly do. I That's\nright. He's most likely someone you've\nmet recently, someone you should be\nquite familiar with and someone who has\nhad a profound influence on you. Do you\nremember when I told your fortune\nbefore? I predicted that you would lead\na mediocre life and die a miserable\ndeath, but now your fate has changed.\nThis means that you've recently met a\nbenefactor, and that's the benefactor\nI'm looking for. Oh, Jun Wuang took out\na small card from his pocket. Call this\nnumber, contact number eight, and\nmention my name for a discount. Bang.\nJun Wuang was kicked away again. Old\ndang, what exactly are you trying to do?\nWhat I'm looking for is a benefactor who\nwill change your destiny, not some\nnumber eight. You just said yourself\nthat you met recently are quite familiar\nwith each other and have had a deep\ninfluence on each other. That's\ndefinitely number eight. Bang. This\ntime, Jun Wuang was met with a karate\nchop to the back of his neck, knocking\nhim unconscious. By the heavenly\nvenerable, I do not wish to do this, but\nthis boy is not very bright, so I will\nhave to search his memories myself. A\nsemi-transparent tentacle emerged from\nbeneath Master Shinshing s wide Tauist\nrobe, burrowed into Jun Wuang&lt;unk&gt;s ear,\nand then adhered to his cerebral cortex.\nChapter 147. The god who rules life.\nThis kid's got some tricks up his\nsleeve. No, no. First, we need to get\nthe person from the celestial venerable.\nHe rotated his tentacles, reading Jun\nWuang s memories. Morly, the little girl\nis quite pretty. Could it be her?\nAccording to the divination, this kid's\nturning point will be after he joins the\nbronze coffin. But this Murong Mungi is\na woman and an ordinary person. She\nshouldn't be arrogant. He continued his\nsearch and eventually focused his\nattention on Sumu. Tsktsk. This Sumu is\nnot simple. He was able to kill the\nunmemorable one. The bronze law he used\nis also something I have never seen\nbefore. That silver vertical pupil seems\nto be related to the evil god. Even if\nthis person is not arrogant, he is\nprobably inseparable from arrogance.\nLet's bring him to the heavenly\nvenerable first and leave the rest to\nthe heavenly venerable to judge. Brother\nSu, my master said he'd like to invite\nyou to dinner at the Chong Shing Tauist\nTemple to thank you for saving me from\nthe unremembered one last time. Jun\nWuang handed over an invitation. Sumu's\neyes flickered slightly. Inviting\nsomeone to dinner? He found it a bit\nstrange. It was normal for a master to\ninvite his apprentice's savior to\ndinner, but the timing was odd. Since it\nhas been a long time since the person\nwith no memory was killed, why would it\nhave been delayed until now if it were\nto be a treat? He took the invitation\nand glanced at it. It contained nothing\nmore than some polite words. This humble\ntauist, Swangzi, thanks you for saving\nmy unworthy disciple. I am hosting a\nbanquet at the Chongqing Tauist Temple.\nPlease do me the honor of attending.\nAfter he finished reading the\ninvitation, suddenly the words on the\ninvitation came to life like a group of\ntadpoles crawling and they crookedly\nformed three large black characters, the\nseven deadly sins. Seeing this,\nSumu&lt;unk&gt;s lips curled up slightly. He\nlooked up at Jun Wu Shang, whose\nexpression remained unchanged, and\nasked, \"Is your master a superhuman?\"\nJun Wuang shook his head. \"No, he is a\nTauist priest who believes in the\nlongevity celestial venerable. He\nusually just uses a few tauist tricks to\nfool people. What kind of toist magic?\nHe calls it tauist magic, but in my\nopinion, it's just a bunch of charlatan\ntricks. And he's unwilling to teach me\neven that, saying I'm not sincere enough\nto receive the true teachings of the\ncelestial venerable of longevity. It's\nbeen a long time since I last saved you.\nWhy is your master suddenly inviting me\nto dinner now? Jun Wuan curled his lip\nin disdain. What else could it be? He\ndidn't have money before. You don't know\nhow stingy my master is, Sugu. He gave\nme a hundred yuan and made me cook four\ndishes and a soup for a week straight. I\nguess he made a lot of money from those\ntwo suckers who came before, so he\nsuddenly being so generous in treating\nme to a meal. Two suckers. Sumu narrowed\nhis eyes slightly. Have you ever seen\nwhat these two look like? Jun Wuang\nimmediately began to speak with great\nenthusiasm. A man and a woman. The man\nwas in his 40s with silver gray hair,\nand the woman looked to be in her 20s\nwith shoulderlength short hair. a 36E\nbust, wrist that reached her crotch,\nwearing a leather jacket, leather pants,\nand leather boots with a weedish\ncomplexion, and delicate features. Stop.\nI understand. Sumu interrupted the other\nperson's long- winded explanation. He\nalready knew who those two people were.\nHe had seen them inqing dream before.\nThe law enforcement captain, Mu Lingsy,\nand the gold level expert, Sikonga. What\nare those two doing going to see your\nmaster? I'm not quite sure and my master\ndidn't let me see it, but I guess it's\nfortuneelling. That's his specialty in\ndeceiving people. The Chongqing Tauist\nTemple can only survive because of his\ndeception everywhere. Fortuneelling.\nUpon hearing this, Sumu became\ninterested. A Tauist priest who could be\nsought out by a gold level expert for\nfortuneelling must be extraordinary.\nWhat's more, after the two finished\ntheir fortuneelling, Master Shinshing\nsent an invitation with the words seven\ndeadly sins written on it. the hidden\nmeaning of which was intriguing. A\nseries of clues connected in his mind,\nand he could roughly guess the cause and\neffect. A strong person like Sikong Xan\nwould not go to have his fortune told\nfor no reason. It was very likely that\nhe wanted to find the seven deadly sins\nthrough Shinqing Daist divination\nskills. Shinqing Daist must have\npredicted his own fate, which is why he\nsent Jun Wu Shang to deliver the\ninvitation. But since the other party\nhas already figured it out, why not tell\nSung Xan? He didn't believe that See\nKong Xan would come to arrest him after\nknowing he was arrogant. If a gold level\nexpert didn't even have this much\nconfidence, he wouldn't deserve to be\ncalled gold. Therefore, it can only be\nthat Master Shiing didn't say it.\nInteresting. Since your master has\nextended such a warm invitation, then I\nshall accept it without hesitation. Sumu\naccepted Jun Wu Shang s invitation. He\nenjoyed the unexpected surprise. As\nevening fell, Sumu, led by Jun Wu Shang,\nwent to the Chongqing Tauist Temple. At\nthe invitation of the temple, this small\ntowist temple in the suburbs really did\nlook like a paradise. An old Tauist\npriest with a white beard stood at the\nentrance of the Tauist Temple early in\nthe morning to greet Su. When he saw\nSumu arrive, his old face was full of\nsmiles. This must be Layman Su. I,\nShianing, greet you. Sumu smiled and\nreturned the greeting. Greetings, Daist\nShian. Please come in quickly. Master\nShinshing welcomed Su Mu into the Tauist\nTemple. Jun Wuang jogged over and\nwhispered in his ear. What kind of food\nhave you prepared? Don't just make a\ncucumber salad and a plate of peanuts.\nBrother Su is my company's department\nhead. Don't embarrass me. Master Shian\nglared at Jun Wuang. Is this the kind of\nstingy person you think of your master?\nJun Wuang glanced at him sideways. H you\nunfil disciple. We have guests here\ntoday so I won't stoop to your level.\nHurry up and go buy some wine. I forgot\nto buy any. Jun Wuang was furious. You\ndidn't forget. You clearly made me spend\nmoney on wine on purpose. Stop talking\nnonsense and get going. Master Shianing\nsent Jun Wuang away and then smiled as\nhe introduced the Chongqing Tauist\nTemple to Sumu. Master Shianing, may I\nask which deity the celestial venerable\nof longevity is? The celestial venerable\nof longevity is the true god who governs\nthe lifespan of all things in the world.\nHe is the most noble god without\nexception. When master shinqing\nmentioned the celestial venerable of\nlongevity, he seemed to become a\ndifferent person. His old face filled\nwith piety. For some reason, seeing his\nexpression, Sumu immediately thought of\nJuan from the primordial god cult. If\none looked closely, the two seemed to\nhave the same expression. Oh, then I\nwonder if this banquet was your idea.\nDaist Master or the idea of the\ncelestial venerable of longevity. Sumu\nasked politely with a smile. Master\nShinshing frowned, then suddenly relaxed\nand laughed heartily. As expected of the\narrogance that is the first of the seven\ndeadly sins. Your insight is indeed\nsharp. Su Mu&lt;unk&gt;s smile widened. Does\nthe Dowist mean you think I'm arrogant?\nMaster Shinshing nodded. If it was just\na doubt before, now that I have seen\nyou, I am absolutely certain. Why? I\nhave met countless people in my life and\nI have never misjudged anyone.\nUnfortunately, Dao was master. You have\nindeed misjudged this time, Sumu said\ncalmly. He was telling the truth because\nhe was not arrogant and there was no\nsuch thing as arrogance in this world.\nArrogance was merely an illusion.\nChapter 148. The gods second invasion.\nLaymansni not worry. I am not a member\nof the Crimson Flame Empire. I have only\never believed in the eternal life\ncelestial venerable. The main reason I\ninvited you here is that you are the\nperson the eternal life celestial\nvenerable has been searching for. Oh,\nSumu&lt;unk&gt;s eyes flickered slightly. Was\na being who seemed to be a god searching\nfor him? I have never seen the celestial\nvenerable of longevity, so why is he\nlooking for me? Master Shianing shook\nhis head. To be honest, I don't know\neither. Before I met you, I didn't even\nknow whether the celestial venerable of\nlongevity was looking for a person or an\nobject. This time it was by chance that\nI found you by deducing the seven deadly\nsins. The statue of the celestial\nvenerable of longevity is in the main\nhall. You will know when you go in. Sumu\nglanced at the main hall where wisps of\nsmoke rose from the ceiling. It was\ncompletely dark inside with no lights\non. What if I say no? Master Shining\nside. Then I can only discuss the Dao\nwith Layman Su. Sumu looked shining\ndaist up and down. He looked to be\nnearly a hundred years old. The man's\nthin and frail body seemed as if a gust\nof wind could blow him over. Master\nShianing smiled calmly. \"Layman Su, I\nknow that arrogance is a gold level\nexpert. Don't be fooled by my\nappearance. If we really risked our\nlives, you might not be a match for me.\nI believe in your abilities, Dowist\nMaster. The fact that you doubt my\narrogance yet still dared to invite me\nspeaks volumes. I'm afraid that even if\nI hadn't come this time, you would have\ncome to me in person, right? That's\nright. I will bring you to see the\nperson the celestial venerable of\nlongevity wants. Even if it means my\ndeath. Also, Mr. Sue, you don't need to\nworry. The celestial venerable of\nlongevity is not one of those evil gods\nwho harm people. He is a legitimate\ndeity. The longevity tauist temple has\nbeen passed down to this day. I dare say\nthat it has never harmed a single\nperson. Whether it was a misperception\nor not, Master Shinshing felt that after\nhe said that the celestial venerable of\nlongevity was not a harmful evil god, a\nhint of disappointment seemed to flash\nacross Sumu's face. Sumu strode into the\ndark hall. He was determined to see the\ncelestial venerable of immortality. He\nwas very curious whether the gods in the\nreal world were the same as the gods in\nthe nightmare world, the primordial\nangels, the serpent god, and now the\neternal celestial venerable. What\nexactly are these? so-called gods. As he\nentered, the silent darkness enveloped\nhim. Sumu continued forward and soon saw\nthe miniature statue on the huge altar.\nThe longevity celestial venerable who\nwas less than 20 cm tall. The statue of\nlooks very old and worn with some paint\nchips like a clay sculpture casually\nplaced on a street stall. But the moment\nhe saw the celestial venerable of\nimmortality, Sumu noticed a colossal\nfigure appear in his field of vision.\nThe figure's towering body almost\npierced the sky, resembling a gigantic\nplanet placed before him. This colossal\nfigure was none other than the celestial\nvenerable of immortality. The\nsurrounding darkness and the main hall\ndisappeared, replaced by a celestial\npalace on the roof. Sumu, dressed in the\nheavenly emperor's robe, sat down, and\nnot far away stood the eternal heavenly\nvenerable who was even taller than\nheaven and earth. Entering a dream,\nSumu's eyes flickered slightly. He\nrealized that the eternal celestial\nvenerable and the primordial angel\nseemed to be of the same ilk. Both of\nthem entering a dream right away. Dais\nfilled the dream world. The celestial\nvenerable of immortality who was the\nsize of a planet stood there\nindifferently without saying a word or\nmaking any movement. A dazzling azure\nlight rose from his body like the rising\nsun. And in an instant, the azure light\nfilled the entire dream world. As the\nblue light rose, Sumu discovered that\nhis body was also covered with a layer\nof blue, which spread like a plague,\nstarting from his abdomen and continuing\nto infiltrate just like the primordial\nangels. With a thought, Sumu's body\ncrumbled inch by inch, and his soul was\ntransferred to endless dimensions.\nHaving encountered the primordial angels\nbefore him, he already had some\nexperience dealing with gods. He didn't\nknow why these gods wanted to possess\nhis soul. Was it because of this dream?\nJust as he was pondering, he suddenly\ndiscovered that the soul's true form,\nhidden in the endless dimensions, was\nstill spreading with a blue light. The\nblue light seemed to be unaffected and\nwas invading the soul at a speed visible\nto the naked eye. In an instant, a\nseries of dowist sounds resounded deep\nwithin Sumu's soul. The sounds were so\nvast and boundless that they made people\nwant to lose themselves in them. The\ndream isolation is ineffective. Could\nthis eternal celestial venerable be even\nmore powerful than the primordial angel?\nAt this moment, the blue light had\ncompletely enveloped the body below the\nneck and continued to spread towards the\nhead. No, it's not that the isolation is\nineffective, but that the celestial\nvenerable of longevity isn't invading my\nsoul. He's invading my dreams. My soul\nand dreams are one. So, when the dreams\nare invaded, the soul is also affected.\nSumu's eyes flashed like lightning as he\nscanned the dream world. The azure color\nwas encroaching on the dream world like\na tsunami, and he had a vague feeling\nthat the dream was about to slip out of\nhis control. The purpose of these gods\nwas indeed what I dreamed about. He knew\nthat if things continued like this, he\nwould probably be completely corrupted\nby the celestial venerable of\nimmortality. But no matter how he\nchanged the dream, he could not stop the\ncelestial venerable of immortality from\ncorrupting him. Elucery dreams cannot\naffect reality. Only gods can defy them.\nThe next moment, a crack appeared\nbetween Sumu's brows, and a divine\nsilver vertical pupil emerged from it.\nIts holy radiance soaring into the sky\nand continuously dispelling the blue\nlight in the dream. The azure light on\nhis body was also forced down by the\nsilver light, slowly retreating to his\nchest. Then the two sides were locked in\na stalemate, but only for a moment\nbefore the azure light began to spread\nagain. However, under the resistance of\nthe silver vertical pupils, the spread\nof the blue light slowed down by\nhundreds of times, and it was not even\nvisible to the naked eye unless one\nlooked closely. Even at its slowest\npace, the Azure light was indeed eroding\nthe dream. Sumu glanced at the speed of\nthe Azure lights invasion and deduced\nthat at most 3 days, the entire dream\nwould be completely tainted by the Azure\nlight. At this moment, the enormous\nstatue of the celestial venerable of\nlongevity in the dream spoke. This was\nthe first time he had spoken before. It\nseemed that the gods were disdainful of\nmortals. Just as when a person steps on\nan ant, there is no need to talk to the\nant unless the ant suddenly lifts up\nyour foot. The sound was vast and\nboundless, like the voice of the great\nDao. It clearly did not belong to any\nlanguage. Yet, it seemed to reach\ndirectly to the soul. Sumu couldn't hear\nthe other party's language, but he could\nsense the traces of anger contained\nwithin it. Suddenly, the Chongqing\nTanzuan uttered a true name that he\ncould understand. Primordial angel.\nHaving the divinity of a primordial\nangel, he understood when the other\nparty uttered the true name of the\nprimordial angel. Although it was\nunclear what the celestial venerable of\nimmortality was saying, one could sense\nhis anger towards the primordial angel,\nas if someone had stolen something he\ncherished. Sumu quickly realized that\nthe eternal celestial venerable's goal\nwas probably his dream. He thought he\ncould easily control the dream. But he\nencountered the obstruction of the\nprimordial angel's divinity, so he was\nangry. He never intended to speak with\nmortals from beginning to end, and his\ncurrent expression of anger is directed\nat the primordial angels. Is this the\narrogance of the gods? Sumu smiled\nsilently. Even though he only had 3 days\nleft before he would be devoured by the\neternal heavenly venerable, he felt no\npanic whatsoever. It was nothing more\nthan death, a trivial matter he had\nsimulated countless times in his dreams.\nNow he was filled with excitement. What\nan interesting thing it was to be able\nto play against the gods. He became\nincreasingly curious about what his\ndream was that could actually cause the\ngods to fight over it. Chapter 149. He's\nbecome a divine messenger again.\nHowever, now is not the time to think\nabout these things. Since he could not\nsolve the problem of the eternal\nheavenly venerable in his dream, he\ncould only start from the outside world.\nWith this thought, Sumu slowly woke up\nfrom his dream. Upon waking, he heard an\nincredibly pitiful whale. Eternal life,\ncelestial venerable. Eternal life,\ncelestial venerable. How did you end up\nshattered like this? Sumu, it was you.\nIt was you who broke the statue of the\neternal life celestial venerable. Elder\nShinshing was in tears. When he saw Sumu\nwake up, his eyes flashed with extreme\nhatred as if they were mortal enemies.\nWhoosh! An ancient long sword was drawn\nand Master Shinshing walked towards Sumu\nwhile crying, asking, \"Why? Why did you\ndo this to the celestial venerable of\nlongevity?\" Although he cried miserably,\nhis aura grew increasingly terrifying.\nThe surrounding air almost froze, and\nthe Chongqing Tauist temple, which had\nbeen filled with the chirping of birds\nand insects, fell into a deathly\nsilence. Thick tentacles emerged from\nunder his wide toist robe and wriggled\nin midair. Sumu slowly stood up and\ncalmly watched the approaching Shinshing\nDaist. He realized that Shinqing Daist\nprobably did not know the true purpose\nof the eternal life celestial venerable.\nGiven the arrogance of the celestial\nvenerable of longevity, he certainly\nwouldn't bother telling Daist Shiing\nanything. The celestial venerable of\nlongevity is the best deity in the\nworld. He is benevolent, forgiving, and\ngreat. But you, you destroyed the statue\nof the celestial venerable of longevity.\nClang Master Shinshing Slongs sword fell\nto the ground. He stared in disbelief at\nSumu, who was radiating a blue light,\nhis whole body trembling with\nexcitement. Why do you possess the\ndivine power of the celestial venerable\nof immortality? Sumu's lie came out\nwithout hesitation. Because the\ncelestial venerable of longevity chose\nme. This isn't exactly a lie. He was\nindeed chosen by the celestial venerable\nof immortality. Master Shinshing was\nstunned. His old face revealing a\ncomplex mix of emotions, envy, longing,\nand awe, but no doubt. The world of\nfanatics is that simple. If you have\ndivine power, then you are a messenger\nof the gods. In their minds, the gods\nthey worship are omnipotent. So, it is\nimpossible for mortals to steal divine\npower from gods. It can only be bestowed\nby the gods. Especially when he thought\nabout the conversation between his\nfuture arrogance and his present self.\nHe deduced that his future arrogance\nmust have borrowed the power of the\neternal heavenly venerable. Now he\nunderstood everything. Pride was the\nmessenger of the eternal heavenly\nvenerable. So Jun Wuang would also join\nthe seven deadly sins in the future. So\nthat's how it is. He was stunned for a\nmoment, then knelt down with a thud and\ncowtowed to Sumu. Looking at the\nfamiliar scene before him, Sumu felt a\npanging of emotion, wondering if he\nwould become a divine messenger for any\nof the major religious sects in the\nfuture. The reason why the statue of the\ncelestial venerable of longevity\nshattered was naturally because the\ndivinity on it transferred to his body\nand was constantly invading his soul so\nmuch so that the spiritual power he\ncasually emitted carried the aura of the\ncelestial venerable of longevity. Which\nis why Master Shining misunderstood.\nSumu bent down and patted Shianing\nDawa's head with practiced ease. Get up.\nThe celestial venerable of longevity has\nbeen watching you. Master Shianing\ntrembled and tears welled up in his eyes\nuncontrollably. Thank you, divine envoy.\nThe old towist priest shakily got up\nfrom the ground, glancing repeatedly at\nSumu, looking as if he wanted to look,\nbut dared not. My lord, the celestial\nvenerable of eternal life suddenly\nbestowed divine power upon you. Is there\nsomething important that matters? Sumu\nnodded. There is indeed a crucial\nmatter, but the time is not yet ripe,\nand this divine messenger cannot tell\nyou. Upon hearing this, Master Shinshing\nfelt a pang of sorrow. He considered\nhimself the most devout follower of the\ncelestial venerable of longevity. But\nnow he had an additional divine\nmessenger. And the messenger and the\ncelestial venerable of longevity had a\nsecret that he could not know. What you\nneed to do now is to fully cooperate\nwith me. Understand? Understood.\nUnderstood. This humble tauist will obey\nthe command of the divine messenger.\nTauist master Shianshin quickly\nexpressed his loyalty. Sumu waited\nsilently for a moment only to find that\nthe divine nature of the eternal\nheavenly venerable within him did not\nchange at all. He thought to himself, as\nexpected, gods never care about mortals.\nThe celestial venerable of eternal life\ndidn't care about his devout followers.\nPerhaps in the celestial venerable of\neternal life's eyes, Sumu Mu and\nShinqing were like two ants talking, and\nhe didn't care about the ants behavior\nat all. Let's talk about yourself first.\nFor the sake of future missions, I need\nto know your full strength in order to\ndecide what important tasks you can\nundertake in the future. Yes, yes, yes.\nI will answer all your questions. Daist\nShinshing nodded like a chicken pecking\nat rice. I am not an extraordinary\nperson. All my strength comes from the\nDao techniques bestowed by the celestial\nvenerable of longevity. If I disregard\nthe consumption of lifespan, I am\nconfident that I can fight against a\ngold level expert. Sumu was not\nsurprised. He had previously guessed\nthat Shinqing possessed strength\ncomparable to that of a gold level\nexpert. But it seemed that his endurance\nwas not as good as that of a true gold\nlevel expert. The primordial angel's\ndivine magic requires sacrifice. The\nmore people sacrificed, the stronger the\npower. The medium for the longevity\ncelestial venerables tauist magic should\nbe lifespan. As master Shinshqing\nnarrated, he gradually came to\nunderstand the other party. Master\nShianqing was an orphan who lived in an\norphanage. Later, the orphanage closed\ndown and he ended up on the streets. He\nwas kidnapped by a gang and his legs\nwere broken. He was forced to become a\ndisabled beggar on the streets. Because\nof his disability, he begged for a lot\nof money everyday, but it all ended up\nin the hands of the gang. To maintain\nhis pitiful appearance, the gang gave\nhim only a little water and food each\nday, leaving him emaciated so that he\ncould beg more easily. This kind of life\nlasted for three whole years. He spent\nevery day in despair and torment. Once a\nkind lady gave him a steamed bun and\ntold him that the gods would protect\nhim. These words became his motivation\nto live. He prayed to the gods every day\nto help him escape his suffering. But\nthere was no response from the gods. In\nthe winter of his final year, he was so\ncold and hungry that he secretly hid\nsome money to buy some food. But he was\ndiscovered by the gangsters and they\nbeat him up. His severely injured body,\ncoupled with the cold and hunger, caused\nhim to develop a high fever and become\ncritically ill. The gangsters naturally\nwouldn't waste money on his medical\ntreatment, so they dumped him in a\ngarbage dump. Even as his consciousness\nwas fading, he continued to pray to the\ngods. And this time, the celestial\nvenerable of immortality responded. He\nfound the statue of the celestial\nvenerable of immortality in the\njunkyard. Warm power flowed into his\nbody, healing his injuries and\ndisabilities. From that day on, he\nunderstood one thing. Only the celestial\nvenerable of immortality was the\ngreatest deity in the world. And only\nthe benevolent celestial venerable of\nimmortality would help him. Later with\nthe help of the celestial venerable of\nlongevity, he gradually grew established\nthe longevity tauist temple and traveled\nall over the world spending his life\nsearching for what the celestial\nvenerable of longevity was looking for.\nAfter listening, Sumu roughly understood\nShinqing&lt;unk&gt;s mentality. In his\ndesperate and suffering life, the one\nwho extended a helping hand to him,\nwhatever that person may be, would be\ncalled a god. The celestial venerable of\nlongevity did not care about\nSchwanching&lt;unk&gt;s faith. He only wanted\nto use Shinshing to find what he wanted.\nBut Shinshing cared and he was willing\nto dedicate his life to helping the god\nin his heart fulfill his wish. Chapter\n150 see, \"You use divination to predict\nthe world in the future?\" Sumu asked\nwith interest. Master Shinshing nodded,\n\"It is absolutely true. I really saw the\nscene of the seven deadly sins\ndestroying the world and my disciple Jun\nWu Shang is the future seven deadly sins\nlust. Sumu found it increasingly\nintriguing for sight. The seven deadly\nsins organization didn't even exist yet.\nAnd even if it did, he was curious why\nhe would lead them to destroy the world.\nThis is not in line with his pursuit. He\nis pursuing excitement. But what\nexcitement is there if the world is\ndestroyed? Could it be that the\nso-called future is something that the\ncelestial venerable of immortality did\nafter taking over his body? As for Jun\nWuang s lust, why would I let Jun Wuang\njoin the seven deadly sins? You should\nknow that Jun Wuang is only a bronze\ntier one transcendent. Although his\npeerless sword dance sequence is not low\nand stronger than Yong Donings, he does\nnot have any absolute advantage. He\nsuddenly realized something and asked,\n\"Does Jun Wuang also know the Dowist\narts of the celestial venerable of\nlongevity? I have already taught him\neverything I can. Only the final\ninitiation ceremony remains, whereby I\nwill report his true name to the\ncelestial venerable of longevity. Once\nacknowledges him, he can then use his\ntowist arts. However, for mortals to use\nthe celestial venerable of longevity's\ntowist arts, it will cost them their\nlifespan. My unworthy disciple is still\nyoung and there is no need for him to\ncome into contact with these things too\nearly. I originally planned to initiate\nhim when I was about to die so that he\ncould go and find what the celestial\nvenerable of longevity wanted in my\nplace. But now there is no need for\nthat. Upon hearing this, Sumu abandoned\nhis idea of learning the Dao of\nimmortality. He realized that whether it\nwas the Dao of immortality or the\nprimordial divine art, they were\nessentially the same thing, both\ninvolving exchanging power with gods,\nprovided that one could connect with a\ngod. This feeling is very similar to the\nlaw. One can only use the law by\nconnecting with it. Could it be that a\nsudden thought flashed through his mind?\nPerhaps the law was also the power of\nthe gods. One had once said that the law\nwas the power of an evil god. A slightly\nhorrifying thought stimulated Sumu&lt;unk&gt;s\nnerves. If everything was really as he\nexpected, then this world would be far\ntoo interesting. Wuang returned from\nbuying wine. Master Shinshing quickly\ninvited Su Moo to take a seat, and the\nbanquet officially began. After the\nbrief incident, thanks to Master\nSchwaning&lt;unk&gt;s deliberate flattery, the\nguests and hosts were all in high\nspirits for a time. Wuang, who couldn't\nhold his liquor, was the first to get\ndrunk, while Sumu remained calm,\nleisurely drinking and eating meat while\ninquiring about everything related to\nthe eternal heavenly venerable from the\nold Tauist Shinqing. After a drinking\nsession, Sumu didn't get much useful\ninformation. Most of it was the\nfanatical praise from the believers. The\ntemplate was basically the same as that\nof the primordial god cult. Both sides\nclaimed that their own gods were\nomnisient, omnipotent, benevolent, and\ngreat, while the others were evil gods.\nIt seems that the only way to deal with\nthe invasion of the eternal celestial\nvenerable is to target the gods. If I\nhadn't devoured the divinity of the\nprimordial angel beforehand, I would\nprobably have already been controlled by\nthe eternal celestial venerable. After\nmuch thought, Sumu gradually formed a\nplan in his mind to go to the nightmare\nworld. Use the emblem of the primordial\ngod cult to lure primordial followers\nand see if he could get help from them.\nAfter a hearty meal, he was invited to\nrest at the Chongqing Tauist Temple,\nwhich he accepted without hesitation. As\nnight fell, Sumu lay in his guest room,\nhis consciousness exploring the dark,\nshadowy space. In the shadowy space,\nYong Donging stood with his eyes closed\nlike a wooden figure. He had come\nprepared for this trip to the Chongqing\nTauist Temple. As the saying goes, one\ntrick is enough to conquer the world.\nHis backup plan was exactly the same as\nwhen he faced the silver level expert Mu\nChung. That is to put the nightmare\napostle that is about to enter into the\nshadow space in advance and when\nencountering danger, escape into the\nshadow space, then hypnotize the other\nparty to sleep and then jump to the\nnightmare world. This trick is no longer\nuseful because it's completely\nineffective against gods. Gods don't\ncare about shadow spaces. They directly\ninvade the soul, and there's no way to\nescape. Sumu brought Yong Doning out,\nhypnotized him into sleep, and then\nconnected their dreams, waiting for the\nnightmare world to descend. Almost the\ninstant Yong Doning fell asleep, a\ncrimson hue appeared out of nowhere in\nhis dream. Ever since, sensing the signs\nof the nightmare world, he hadn't slept\nfor several days, suppressing its\narrival.\nSplash! Splash! The waves kept crashing\nagainst the rocks on the shore, and\nseveral seagulls circled in the sky,\noccasionally letting out cries. The\nblinding sunlight shone directly from\nthe sky onto the beach. Yong Donging,\nwho was in his sleep, frowned as he was\nstartled awake by the sunlight. He saw a\nbeach with yellow sand like coarse salt\ncovering the ground, covered with\nseashells of various shapes that\nshimmerred in the sunlight. Not far away\nlies the vast and boundless sea with\nwaves churning and shimmering. As far as\nthe eye can see, the sea and sky meet in\na single line. This is a nightmare\nworld, he suddenly realized, and as if\nby reflex, he got up from the beach, his\nslightly panicked eyes scanning around.\nOnly after seeing a familiar figure did\nhe breathe a sigh of relief. That figure\nwas none other than Sumu. Sumu was\nstanding on a huge reef, gazing at the\nsea, his brown tinted glasses reflecting\nthe dazzling sunlight. This is\ntroublesome, he muttered to himself.\nWhat's the trouble? This time the\nnightmare. Young Donging leaned closer.\nSumu shook his head and did not answer.\nThe trouble he was referring to was not\nthis nightmare, but the eternal heavenly\nvenerable. In his plan, after entering\nthe nightmare world, he would\nimmediately seek out the edge of the\nnightmare, which is the black mist. Then\nhe would enter the black mist world, use\nthe emblem of the primordial god cult to\ncontact the primordial god cult and try\nto use the power of the primordial\nangels to fight against the eternal\ncelestial venerable. It is still unknown\nwhether the primordial angels or the\neternal deities are stronger. Their\nstrength cannot be judged based on their\nappearance in dreams since this is not\ntheir full power but only a small part\nof their divinity. It's like two\nbillionaires. One eats a flatbread and\ntofu pudding for breakfast, spending\nfive yuan, while the other eats seafood\nporridge, spending hundreds of yuan.\nThis doesn't really show who is richer.\nThe plan is now thwarted because this\nnightmare world is significantly larger\nthan it appears. It's actually an\nisland. He had previously looked out\nfrom a high vantage point and hadn't\nseen the endless black fog on the\nisland, which meant the fog was over the\nsea. To enter the black mist, one must\ntake a boat out to sea to find it, which\ntakes time. And that's exactly what Sumu\nneeds most right now. At the speed of\nthe eternal celestial venerables\ninvasion, he could occupy the entire\ndream world in at most 3 days. Chapter\n151. Sumu, \"Save me. Look, there's a\nfishing boat over there.\" Yong Donging\nsuddenly exclaimed, pointing to the sea\nto the northwest. Sumu looked in the\ndirection of the sound and indeed saw a\ndilapidated fishing boat sailing toward\nthe shore. As the boat got closer,\nseveral figures could be vaguely seen on\nit, waving their arms toward the shore.\nYong Donging was somewhat puzzled. Are\nthese nightmare creatures unusually\nfriendly? They're greeting us from such\na distance. Sumu, could there be\nsomething fishy going on? Sumu pushed up\nhis brown tinted glasses with a hint of\nhelplessness. Are you sure they were\ngreeting each other and not calling for\nhelp? Call for help. Yong Donging was\ntaken aback. He observed carefully and\nhis expression changed slightly. The\nfishing boat had stopped moving forward\nand was stopped on the sea surface and\nit was sinking at a speed visible to the\nnaked eye. The ship is sinking. Are\nthese people in their nightmare stupid?\nThey're so close to the shore. Why don't\nthey just jump in and swim over? Don't\ntell me that people who go out to sea to\nfish can't swim. Sumu gazed through his\nbrown tinted glasses at the deep seabed.\nA glimmer of crystallin blue light\nappearing in his eyes. His powerful\neyesight allowed him to vaguely see\nseveral dark shadows moving beneath the\nfishing boat. The ship didn't sink\nnaturally. Something in the sea was\nsabotaging their ship. This was\nabsolutely a case of misfortune piling\nupon misfortune for him. The only way to\nfind the black mist was to go out to sea\nby boat. But now it seemed that the sea\nwas not safe at all and something might\nbe scuttling the boat as their strength\nis greatly reduced when their feet are\nnot on the ground. At this point, the\nfishing boat could no longer hold on,\nand the three panicked fishermen on\nboard finally chose to jump into the\nsea. They swam frantically toward the\nshore as if they were being chased by\nsharks. It was at this moment that Sumu\nfinally saw what was on the seabed, a\nperson. The bodies of people who had\nbeen submerged in sea water for an\nunknown amount of time and were already\nrotting, with even their bones exposed,\nhad undergone a transformation. Black\ntendrils of flesh were growing from\ntheir decaying flesh. Whoosh! entangled\nin black fleshy tendrils, a fisherman at\nthe very back was immediately strangled\nand dragged into the sea, disappearing\nwithout a trace. Save them. Sumu\ndecisively gave the order. Although he\nknew these fishermen weren't real\npeople, but rather beings from a\nnightmare, he still had to save them\nbecause he needed the information from\nthis place as well as a boat. The ships\ncertainly can't go looking for sea\nmonsters to take it. Bang, bang, bang. A\nseries of gunshots rang out as Sum Mu\nand Yong Dongqing drew their pistols and\nfired continuously at the monster in the\nsea. Both of them were superhumans, so\ntheir accuracy was naturally excellent,\nespecially Sumu, who has been playing\nwith guns in his dreams for a long time,\nand his accuracy is comparable to that\nof a sharpshooter. However, firearms\nseem to be useless against the sea\nmonsters. Even when bullets rain down on\nthem, they could not cause any fatal\nwounds. Their rotting bodies were\npierced by bullets, and apart from the\nforce of the bullets slightly pushing\nthem back, they had no effect\nwhatsoever. Sumu narrowed his eyes,\nswitched guns, took out the silver rose\nand started firing with mythal bullets.\nSince Murang Zhua's death, Nangong Mung\nhad been fighting for the family fortune\nand had already made considerable\nprogress. These tangible benefits also\nbenefited him, with the Myithil bullet\nbeing the most obvious example. However,\na shocking scene unfolded. The myithal\nbullets, which were supposed to be able\nto suppress supernatural powers, were\nineffective. They were useless against\nthese monsters. And even when hit in the\nhead, the monsters maintained their\ntenacious vitality. Fortunately, under\nthe suppression of fire, the remaining\ntwo fishermen finally managed to escape\nashore. Run, run. Quickly find the\nguards. These sea monsters are\nunkillable. Only the guards can deal\nwith them. Two fishermen dressed in\ncoarse linen shirts and with dark skin\nkept shouting, trying to get Sumu and\nhis companion to escape. Sumu's eyes\nflickered slightly. A siren unkillable.\nIs this nightmare monster really that\ndifficult to deal with? He was eager to\ntry, but instead chose to leave and\nwaited for the siren to come ashore. The\ntwo fishermen were alarmed and without\nfurther persuasion turned and ran away.\nSoon, five rotting humanoid creatures\nemerged from the sea, their bodies\ncovered in tangled black fleshy\ntendrils. Slightly fishy smelling\nseaater dripped continuously from them.\nDrip, drip, bang. A myith my bullet\nstruck one of the sirens heads with\npinpoint accuracy, piercing the rotting\nskull between its brows. The sirens\nmerely shook their heads before charging\ntowards Sumu. Isn't it the influence of\nseawater? Is immortality an inherent\ncharacteristic of the siren? He\ncontinued his attempts, unleashing a\nmassive surge of spiritual power.\nHowever, when his spiritual power probed\ninto the sea monster's body, he was\nsurprised to find that it was completely\nempty. This means that sirens have no\nsouls. They are not living beings, but\ninanimate objects. But how can inanimate\nobjects move? What force supports them?\nLet me handle this. Yong Donging smiled\nconfidently. You think you're immortal?\nI'll shatter you into pieces and see if\nyou can still live. He charged forward\nlike a human cannonball. His body\ngleaming with a metallic sheen or like a\nbowling ball being thrown. Boom. He\nthrew a punch, the tip of his fist\nflashing with a cold metallic light,\naimed at the rotting head of one of the\nsirens. The powerful force shattered the\nrotting head, but the headless siren did\nnot stop. As if it didn't need eyes, it\naccurately reached for Yong Doning. Yong\nDoning looked disdainful. With that\npunch just now, he had already tested\nthe strength of these sea monsters.\nApart from being immortal, they were\nonly slightly stronger than ordinary\npeople. Even if he stood still and let\nthem hit him, he couldn't break through\ntheir defenses. The rotting hand grabbed\nhis body, but failed to pierce his\nsteely skin. He snorted coldly and\nsnapped the others hand in two with a\ncasual flick of his wrist. Then, not\nforgetting to turn around, he said to Su\nMu with a very sophisticated air, \"You\ncan just watch from the side. I'll take\ncare of the others.\" After saying that,\nYong Donging turned around, his gaze\ndisdainful, and what greeted him was a\nblack fleshy beard. He snorted again and\nwithout dodging or avoiding, reached out\nto grab the tentacle, intending to cut\noff the black fleshy tendrils in the\nsame way. But just as the two made\ncontact, he was caught off guard. His\nface suddenly turned pale, his soul\ntrembled, and an unimaginable pain\nsurged through his body. He screamed.\nThen his body went limp, and he\ncollapsed to the ground. As Yong Doning\nfell to the ground, more and more black\nfleshy tendrils wrapped around his body.\nEvery time a black fleshy tendril landed\non him, he would feel as if he had been\nelectrocuted, and his whole body would\nconvulse violently. \"Uh, Sumu, save me.\"\nYong Donging screamed and reached out to\nSumu. Chapter 152. The Undying Siren.\nBang! Bang! Bang! The ordinary bullets\nstruck Yong Donging with perfect\naccuracy, severing his flesh and leaving\nseveral white marks on his steel body.\nHaving broken free of his restraints,\nYong Donging immediately sprang to his\nfeet and hurriedly fled from the sea\nmonster. He returned to Su Mu&lt;unk&gt;s\nside, panting heavily, his face deathly\npale. Those black fleshy tendrils are\nstrange. As soon as I touched them, I\nfelt excruciating pain all over my body\nand couldn't muster any strength.\nSu&lt;unk&gt;s eyes gleamed with a crystal\nblue light and they myriad\nmanifestations technique was activated\nsilently creating identical replicas of\nSu Mu and Yong Doning in front of the 5C\nmonsters. Without any hesitation, the\nfive sirens pounced on the illusion. H\ntheir eyes are already rotten, yet they\nare still deceived by illusions. How do\nthey perceive the outside world? The\nnext second, Sumu got the answer. Five\nsea monsters extended their black fleshy\nwhiskers and attacked the illusion. The\nillusion which was originally impossible\nto break was shattered in response to\nthe attack of the black fleshy whiskers.\nFeeling his mental energy diminish, Sumu\nfinally understood the black fleshy\ntendrils were designed to attack the\nspirit. In other words, they were\ndevouring the spirit. The black fleshy\nwhiskers had the ability to devour\nspiritual energy. so they could directly\ndevour illusions constructed from\nspiritual energy and ignore Yong\nDoning&lt;unk&gt;s steel body, directly\naffecting his soul, a method of directly\nattacking the soul. Sumu smiled\nsilently, somewhat eager to try it out.\nWith a light touch of his toes, he\nappeared like a ghost in front of a\nsiren, and grabbed one of its black\nwhiskers. Yong Donging was shocked.\nSumuyu. The moment the two made contact,\nSumu immediately felt a phantom black\nfleshy tendril appear in his soul,\ntearing at it like a venomous snake. But\nwhen the fleshy tendrils landed on the\nsoul that was almost completely covered\nin blue light, they sizzled. The azure\nlight suddenly brightened, radiating a\nmagnificent and boundless power. In an\ninstant, the black fleshy whiskers\nvanished. But that wasn't all. The azure\nlight represented the power of the\neternal heavenly venerable. This divine\npower, as if enraged, flowed down the\nblack fleshy whiskers and landed on the\nsea monster. The supposedly immortal\nsiren died on the spot. To be precise,\nit turned to ashes, its body seemingly\nannihilated at the atomic level, leaving\nno trace in the world. Sumu's eyes\nflickered slightly. It seemed that the\ncelestial venerable of longevity had\nalready taken his soul as his\npossession, and therefore would not\nallow anything else to touch it. This\ngave him a new idea. If there were\nenough sea monsters, wouldn't they be\nable to consume the power that the\ncelestial venerable of immortality had\nleft in his soul? Without much\nhesitation, he grabbed all four sea\nmonsters black whiskers in his hand.\nSure enough, as the sea monsters began\nto devour his soul, a beam of azure\nlight swept out, instantly annihilating\nall the sea monsters. However, a god is\na god after all. Even after killing five\nsea monsters, the blue light showed no\nsign of weakening. You killed them all.\nHow did you do that? Shocked, Yong\nDoning jogged over, squatted down, and\nkept shoveling sand, but found no trace\nof the sea monsters. Anyone with hands\ncan do it, Sumu said with a smile. Yong\nDonging&lt;unk&gt;s face darkened, and he was\nspeechless, especially when he recalled\nhis failed attempt to show off. Even his\nsteely face became somewhat embarrassed.\nFortunately, someone came to his rescue.\nThe sound of hurried footsteps came from\nthe island behind them. A group of\nsoldiers in silver armor carrying long\nspears rushed over led by two fishermen.\nMy lord, the siren is just ahead and two\npeople dressed in strange clothes are\nbeing attacked. When they arrived, their\nhurried steps suddenly stopped and the\ntwo fishermen were stunned to see Su Mu\nand his companion completely unharmed.\nThe armored man at the head of the group\nsaid coldly, \"You two want to die for\ndeceiving the guards?\" The two fishermen\nwere startled and quickly explained, \"I\nI we didn't. There really was a sea\nmonster just now, but they probably\nchased it away.\" The armored man turned\nhis gaze to Sumu and the other man. Who\nare you two? Judging from your clothes,\ncould you be from other islands? Sumu\nnodded. Exactly. The armored man's tone\nsoftened slightly. Was there really a\nsiren just now? Yong Doning replied,\n\"There were five, but we've already\nkilled them.\" Upon hearing this, the\nguards and the two fishermen fell\nsilent. Suddenly, a soft laugh came from\nbeneath the armor. Haha. Kill sea\nmonsters, young man. The immortal sea\nmonsters are beings cursed by the sea\ngod. They can never be killed, only\ndriven away. What you mean by killing\nthem is probably just smashing them to\npieces, right? Indeed, some outsiders\nmight mistakenly believe they have\nkilled the sea monster and that once the\nmonster is completely immobilized, it\nwill turn into a puddle of seaater and\neventually disappear. But in reality,\nthey have simply returned to the ocean\nand will soon return. Yong Dong was\nstunned. Turned into seaater. He\nsubconsciously looked towards the spot\nwhere the sea monster had died. There\nwas only sand there, not a trace of\nseaater. Can I see this immortal sea\nmonster is indeed amazing. Sumu suddenly\nsaid, \"I'm very curious. With such a\ndifficult sea monster to deal with,\nit's&lt;unk&gt; unlikely that there are any\nliving people on this island.\" The\narmored man said proudly, \"You're right.\nBut our great king has the power to\nrival the gods. Sea stones blessed by\nhim have the power to drive away sea\nmonsters. It is because of his existence\nthat our country can continue to exist.\nTo counter the power of the gods.\" This\nsuddenly piqued Su Mu&lt;unk&gt;s interest. He\nhad personally witnessed the power of\nthe gods. Although they were not the\ngods in their physical forms, their\npower far surpassed that of humans. How\nterrifying would it be if someone\npossessed the power to contend with the\ngods? Even a gold level expert probably\nwouldn't dare say they could contend\nwith the god. You can tell from Master\nSchwaning's attitude towards the\ncelestial venerable of longevity. So,\nit's highly likely that the sea god\nwasn't a real deity or that the king was\njust bragging. You two outsiders come\nwith me to register. His Majesty the\nKing is very kind and willing to accept\noutsiders as citizens of the Sea\nKingdom. Sumu's eyes flickered slightly.\nAre there other outsiders in the Kingdom\nof the Sea? Of course, every year some\noutsiders drift to the sea kingdom.\nSpeaking of which, it seems that a few\npeople just arrived a few days ago, but\nit seems that they came ashore from the\neast side of the island. I don't know\nthe specifics. Sumu, could it be? Yong\nDonging leaned closer and whispered with\na serious expression. There's no need to\ndoubt something so obvious. Sumu felt\nhelpless at Yong Donging&lt;unk&gt;s\nmysterious tone. Did this kind of thing\neven need guessing? The outsiders who\ncome every year, a few of them just\narrived a few days ago. Aren't they the\nnightmare apostles? He concluded that\nthe so-called outsiders were nightmare\napostles, not natives like the primal\ngod cult. Because natives mostly lived\nin the middle hell of hell, while\nnightmare apostles never descended into\nthe middle hell. Afterwards, Sumu and\nhis companion followed the guards into\nthe depths of the island. Chapter 153. A\nnightmare full of living people. Passing\nthrough rows of tall coconut trees, Sumu\nsaw a sturdy and ancient city wall in\nthe distance. The greystones were\nweathered and worn, and many soldiers in\nsilver armor patrolled the wall. The\nhuge city gate was made of heavy wood\nand fixed with iron bars and nails.\nChief, the Sea Kingdom is just ahead,\"\nthe escorting soldiers said\nrespectfully. The other soldiers,\nincluding the two fishermen, did not\nreact to his strange form of address, as\nif it were perfectly normal. \"Holy\ncrap!\" Yong Doning exclaimed, quickly,\nmoving closer. \"When did you hypnotize\nthem all?\" Sumu glanced at him, but\nignored him. Although these fishermen\nand soldiers were all humans in the\nnightmare, they were essentially\nordinary people. With his current\nstrength, hypnotizing these people would\nbe a piece of cake. He looked around at\nthe small kingdom before him. Calling it\na kingdom would be an exaggeration. It\nwas basically a town. A town on an\nisland. He did not rush forward, but\ninstead tried to extract information\nfrom the hypnotized soldiers. How many\npeople live in the sea kingdom? Over a\n100,000, the soldier replied\nrespectfully. How do you treat\noutsiders? Are there any traps inside?\nSumu didn't think the people in the\nnightmares would be so friendly, as\nevidenced by both Ting&lt;unk&gt;s nightmare\nand the ear beasts nightmare. So his\nfirst reaction was that the soldiers\nwere lying and were planning to lure him\nand Yong Donging inside before taking\naction. But the soldiers answer was\nsomewhat unexpected. Outsiders are very\nwelcome and the king is very friendly to\nthem. Some talented outsiders even serve\nas officials in the sea kingdom. Sumu\nfrowned slightly, putting aside the\nfriendly relations for the moment. What\nwas going on with this official them? If\nall outsiders were nightmare apostles,\nthey wouldn't be able to stay in the sea\nkingdom for very long. Even if they\ncouldn't break free from the dream, they\nwould automatically wake up from the\nnightmare after 10 or 15 days. What were\nyou originally planning to do? The\nsoldier answered, \"Honestly, we\noriginally planned to take you, our\nleader, to register and then meet the\nking. The king would meet all outsiders.\nIf an outsider was capable, he would be\ngiven an official position and a woman.\nIf he was not capable, he would be given\na house and a woman.\" Sumu, are you sure\nthe hypnosis was successful? This is too\nexaggerated. This is a nightmare. This\nis clearly a beautiful dream. He gave me\na woman as soon as I walked in the door.\nYong Donging was dumbfounded. The\nsoldier's words almost shattered his\nstereotype of the nightmare world.\nSumu's lips curled up slightly.\nSometimes unseen dangers are more\nterrifying than obvious ones. You said\nbefore that sea stones can drive away\nimmortal sea monsters. What are sea\nstones? The sea stone is a stone blessed\nby the king, possessing the power to\ndrive away sea monsters, the soldier\nsaid, pulling a white pebble from his\narmor. Sumu took the pebble and examined\nit carefully. A crystal blue light\nemanated from behind his brown glasses\nas invisible spiritual power surged into\nit. After a moment, he withdrew his\nspiritual power and frowned slightly. He\nfound nothing unusual about the sea\nstone. His spiritual perception told him\nthat it was just an ordinary stone.\nCould it be that the level of power is\ntoo high, making it impossible to see\nthrough? With this in mind, Sumu\ndirectly opened the divine eye between\nhis eyebrows to take a look. But the\nanswer was still the same. It was just\nan ordinary stone. Things are getting\nmore and more interesting with an\nenthusiastic king and ordinary stones\nthat can drive away sirens. Let's go. He\nstroed towards the city gate of the sea\nkingdom. As he entered the city gate, he\nwas greeted by narrow winding streets\npaved with cobblestones lined with\nwooden houses with pointed roofs covered\nwith tiles. Many dark-kinned pedestrians\nwalked on the street, some talking\nloudly, others stopping in front of the\nstalls to haggle with the vendors. The\natmosphere was very peaceful, and the\npeople lived and worked in peace and\ncontentment, making the island seem like\na secluded paradise. Yang Doning felt a\nchill for no reason. He looked wearily\nat the pedestrians around him and\nwhispered, \"I feel like there's\nsomething wrong with them. This is the\nnightmare world. How can there be so\nmany living people? I've read similar\nhorror stories. They say that seemingly\npeaceful towns don't actually have a\nsingle living person. They're all ghosts\nin disguise.\" Sumu shook his head. No,\nthey are indeed living people. He had\nalready used his mental powers to\ninvestigate and discovered that these\npeople were indeed living, breathing\nhuman beings. No one says that there\ncan't be living people in the nightmare\nworld. It's not strange for people to\nhave any kind of dreams. When a dream\nbecomes reality, the people in the dream\nnaturally become living people. Could\nthis be a secluded island and the\nnightmare monsters are the immortal sea\nmonsters? Is it possible to return to\nreality by killing those sea monsters?\nYong Donging asked excitedly. If\neverything was as he expected, it would\nbe too easy. Although he couldn't kill\nthe sea monster, Sumu could. He just\nneeded to stand on the shore and lure\nthe sea monster ashore, then kill them\none by one until they were all gone.\nWith this thought in mind, Yong Doning\nbegan to confidently deduce. I have\nroughly guessed the theme of this dream.\nIt is very likely a child's dream\nbecause everything is very similar to a\nfairy tale. Kind fishermen live on a\nsecluded island and make a living by\nfishing. But evil sea monsters often\nattack the fisherman. In the end, the\nfishermen defeat the sea monsters under\nthe leadership of a warrior. Or perhaps\nit's a fisherman's dream. He grew up\nlistening to tales of sea monsters while\nfishing at sea everyday, and that's why\nhe has nightmares. H, not bad reasoning.\nDon't try to reason like that again next\ntime,\" Sumu said calmly. He ignored Yong\nDong&lt;unk&gt;s dissatisfaction and instead\ncarefully observed the town. He noticed\nthree interesting things. First, the\npeople here dressed very provocatively,\nespecially the women who went out on the\nstreet barely covering their private\nparts. Secondly, there are no elderly\npeople here. At least he hasn't seen any\nelderly people yet, not even anyone who\nis slightly older. Thirdly, it's about\nthe era. This shouldn't be a modern\ndream because there are no modern\nfacilities to be seen on the streets.\nThe arrival of Su Mu and his companion\nattracted the attention of passers by\nwho cast curious or weary glances at the\ntwo outsiders. Soon, led by a soldier,\nthe two went to a place that resembled\nan administrative hall and completed\nbasic information registration. At this\ntime, a neatly dressed man with a small\nmustache and wearing luxurious clothes\nwalked over. He introduced himself as\nthe governor of the sea kingdom. You\ntoo, his majesty the king invites you.\nYang Donging was slightly takenback. The\nsoldier who led the way had already been\nhypnotized by Sumu and had not informed\nthe king at all. How could the king have\nfound out so soon after the\nregistration? Sumu smiled politely. I\nwould also like to meet his majesty, the\nking of the sea kingdom. The consul\nsmiled and nodded, then led the two into\na carriage and headed straight for the\nking&lt;unk&gt;s castle. Chapter 154. I've\nspent 10 years in the nightmare world.\nThe castle is located in the center of\nthe sea kingdom and also the highest\npoint on the island. It is built of gray\nstones with towering walls and looks\nancient and grand unlike the magnificent\ncastles and fairy tales. When the\ncarriage arrived at the castle gate, the\nheavy wooden gate was slowly opened by\nthe people inside making a dull sound.\nUpon entering the castle, the first\nthing that catches the eye is the\nspacious courtyard with clean and tidy\nstone-paved ground and a fountain shaped\nlike a mermaid in the middle. Yong Dona\nkept looking around the castle, his\nexpression wary, guarding against every\nbush or rockery, as if afraid that some\nmonster might suddenly jump out. He had\nexperienced several nightmare worlds,\nbut he had never seen a nightmare so\nsafe. Soon, the two disembarked from the\ncarriage and led by the consul entered\nthe castle hall where they met the\nso-called king. The king was a\nmiddle-aged man whose skin was not as\ndark as that of the people outside, but\nrather very fair. His angular face\ncarried a unique temperament that came\nwith the passage of time, and he had a\nwarm smile on his lips. He did not look\nlike a king at all, but rather like the\nuncle next door. However, Sumu and his\ncompanion did not focus their attention\non the king, but instead kept glancing\nat the seven people sitting on the seats\non both sides of the hall. The seven\npeople were dressed completely\ndifferently from the citizens of the sea\nkingdom. Some were in suits, some in\nsportsware, and some in short skirts.\nIt's obvious that these seven are\nnightmare apostles. The seven nightmare\napostles also focused their gazes on\nSumu and his companion, but their gazes\nwere strange, filled with anxiety,\npanic, and even despair. However, that\nwasn't the whole story. Two of the seven\nseemed to have given up, leaning against\ntheir chairs with lifeless eyes, each\nwith a rather attractive maid standing\nbehind them, massaging their shoulders.\nMr. Su, Mr. Yang, hello. I am the king\nof the sea kingdom. Of course, as modern\npeople, you can also call me by my name,\nHu Jia, the king said with a friendly\nsmile. Yang Doning was taken aback and\nblurted out. You're from reality, too.\nKing Hu Jia stated bluntly. That's\nright. I also come from reality. I am\nfrom the Dragon Abyss Empire. May I ask\nwhich of the seven great empires you two\nare from? The Dragon Abyss Empire. Young\nDonging was surprised. Even though he\nwas a poor student, he knew some basic\ncommon sense. There were seven major\nempires in the real world and the Dragon\nAbyss Empire was recognized as the\nstrongest among them. The Crimson Flame\nEmpire, Sumu said with a slight smile.\nOh, the Crimson Flame Empire. What a\ncoincidence. It seems that Miss Muing is\nalso from the Crimson Flame Empire among\nthe nightmare apostles who came in this\ntime. Hujia looked at the only girl\nwearing a short skirt among the seven\nnightmare apostles. The girl in the\nshort skirt frowned as if she had\nsomething on her mind. She didn't say\nanything and just nodded politely. Yong\nDonging glanced at Muing curiously, a\nlook of amazement flashing in his eyes.\nAlthough Muing&lt;unk&gt;s expression was\nindifferent, it did not affect her\nbeauty at all. Her face was small and\ndelicate with fair skin seemingly only\nthe size of a palm like a white\nporcelain doll. Her long, straight black\nhair was styled in a princess cut paired\nwith a red JK plaid skirt. And with a\nheight of less than 1.6 6 m. She looked\njust like a girl who had stepped out of\na manga. Yang Doning couldn't help but\ntake a few more glances, thinking that\nhe would buy Jasmine a JK uniform when\nhe got back. I know you two must be\nwondering right now, but don't worry,\ndinner is about to begin. Let's eat and\ntalk. Before long, the servants in the\ncastle began to bring out dish after\ndish, filling the long table. It looked\nlike a dazzling array of dishes, but if\nthey were mostly seafood such as fish\nand shrimp or wild vegetables and\npotatoes. After everyone was seated, the\nking began to speak slowly. You two\ndon't need to be so reserved. I know it\nsounds incredible, but in fact, this\ndream island is not as scary as you\nimagine. It is different from any\nnightmares you have encountered before.\nIt is safe on the island, and there are\nno nightmare monsters. The only threat\ncomes from the sea. You can even live a\npeaceful life here. Sumu took a sip of\nthe coconut wine unique to the sea\nkingdom and asked, \"Mr. Who?\" As far as\nI know, nightmare apostles cannot\nsurvive in the nightmare world for long.\nEven if they cannot break free from the\ncurrent nightmare, they will\nautomatically wake up and return to the\nreal world when the time comes. I wonder\nwhat you mean by a peaceful life. Hu\nsmiled slightly, about to explain, but\nwas interrupted by a nightmare apostle\nwho looked excited. What does he mean?\nHe means we can't go back. None of us\ncan go back to the real world. And we\ncan only live on this damn island\nforever. The speaker was a young man in\nsportsware. His fists clenched and his\nface contorted with rage. What did you\nsay? Young Doning jumped up from his\nseat. What do you mean by saying we\ncan't go back? He was anxious because he\nwanted to go back more than anyone else.\nJasmine was still waiting for him. The\nyoung man in sportsware said with a grim\nexpression, \"If you can't go back, you\ncan't go back. Ask him.\" He pointed at\nthe king, then fell silent, picked up\nthe wine glass on the table, and drank\nit all in one gulp. Not satisfied with\njust one glass, he poured himself\nanother, seemingly trying to drown his\nsorrows and alcohol. Yong Doning looked\nat the king with some disbelief. Mr.\nWho, what exactly do you mean by we\ncan't&lt;unk&gt;t go back? Sigh. Who? Jia\nsighed. Mr. Yang, I know it's hard for\nyou to accept, and it's hard for every\nnightmare apostle who comes here to\naccept, but it's the truth. This\nnightmare is not the ordinary nightmare\nwe've experienced before. It has been\ninvaded by the power of the sea god.\nWhat do you mean by being invaded by the\npower of the sea god? What does that\nhave to do with not being able to return\nto reality? Yang Doning became\nincreasingly anxious. He had to go back.\nThe sea god is a deity in the nightmare\nworld. No one has ever seen him and no\none knows what kind of being he is. The\nonly thing I know is that when the sea\ngod's power invaded this dream, its\nconnection with the real world was\ncompletely severed. In the past,\nnightmare apostles only needed to\nsurvive in the nightmare for a period of\ntime and then they would naturally\nreturn to the real world. But due to the\npower of the sea god, no one can go\nback. Hujia's face showed sorrow as if\nrecalling some past events. I don't\nbelieve it. What [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Poseidon. I\nmust go back. As Yong Dong&lt;unk&gt;s\nemotions fluctuated, a metallic sheen\nappeared on his body. There&lt;unk&gt;'s no\ngoing back. Huji sighed. Mr. Yang, do\nyou know how long I've been here? 10\nyears. A full 10 years. What? Yong\nDongqing was suddenly shocked. His first\nreaction was disbelief. How could there\nbe a nightmare apostle who could stay in\nthe nightmare world for 10 years? He\nsubconsciously glanced around at the\nreactions of the others only to find\nthat everyone looked sorrowful and no\none questioned him. That's right. It's\nbeen 10 years. I entered this nightmare\n10 years ago. At that time, I was\nattacked by the undead sea monsters.\nThey weren't very strong, but they were\nimpossible to kill. I originally planned\nto kill all the nightmare monsters and\nthen break free from the nightmare to\nreturn to reality. But when I found that\nthey were impossible to kill, I changed\nmy strategy and waited for the time to\ncome so I could return automatically.\nBut I waited for a month, 2 months, even\na year or two, and I still didn't wake\nup from the nightmare. During this time,\nmany nightmare apostles came like me.\nThey were also unable to wake up. We\nthen realized that this nightmare was a\ndead end and there was no way to go\nback. After years of investigation, we\nlearned that the culprit behind\neverything was the sea god. The sea god\nis the deity of the sea and the immortal\nsea monster originated from him. His\npower influenced this nightmare. Chapter\n155. Is Sumu a gold level expert? Have\nyou seen the sea god? Muing, who had\nbeen silent all along, suddenly spoke.\nHer voice was clear and crisp, even a\nlittle childlike, which made her serious\nexpression with furrowed brows seem a\nlittle out of place. Hu Jia shook his\nhead. It's ridiculous. I've been here\nfor 10 years, and I've never seen the\nsea god once. I've gone deep into the\nsea countless times, fantasizing that\nmaybe if I could solve the problem at\nits root by solving the sea god, but I\nfailed because the sea god is not a\ncreature at all. It is the sea itself.\nWherever the sea is, its power\ninfluences that place. Although I am a\nsilver tier one transcendent, I am\nutterly incapable of killing the sea.\nLet alone me. Even a legendary gold tier\npowerhouse would be powerless against\nit. That's why I said there's no going\nback. Anyone who sets foot on this\nisland can never go back. Muing frowned\nand fell silent. No one knew what she\nwas thinking. Hold back any longer. I\ndon't believe it. These are all just\nyour side of the story. What the king\nsaid is true. A male voice suddenly rang\nout from outside the door. A fat man\nwalked in, his nose twitching and his\neyes lit up as he looked at the food on\nthe table. Old who? You're really\nunfair. You always bring out these good\nthings to entertain the new nightmare\napostles while we old friends get to eat\nleftovers. The fat man seemed to be very\nfamiliar with the king. As soon as he\ncame in, he found a seat close to Muing,\nsat down, picked up the food on the\ntable, and started eating. His leerous\nlittle eyes would occasionally steal\nglances at Muing&lt;unk&gt;s slender legs\nexposed under her short skirt. Muing\nglanced at the fat man expressionlessly,\nthen casually covered her lap with the\nclean white napkin on the table. Who are\nyou? Yong Donging asked, \"I am Ping\nYong, the Minister of Finance of the Sea\nKingdom. I have been here for 5 years.\"\n\"Young brother, when I first came here,\nI had the same thoughts as you. I\nthought that Lu looked like a\ntreacherous person and was definitely\nnot a good person. He talked nonsense\nand was sure that he had some kind of\nconspiracy to deceive me. After waiting\nfor a year, guess what? We really\ncouldn't go back. Ping Yong ate the\nbright red lobster with gusto, even\nsucking out the inards from the head. He\nglanced at Yong Donging, whose face was\nfull of disbelief and laughed. Why don't\nyou believe me yet, little brother?\nDon't be so suspicious. Think about it\ncarefully. If Lahu is lying, why would\nhe tell a lie that is so easy to expose?\nIf you still don't believe me, just wait\na year or two and you'll know. Yong\nDongqing was immediately struck a heavy\nblow. Jasmine, no. I don't believe it.\nWe can definitely go back. Sumu, Sumu,\nsay something. When he was at a loss,\nthe first person he thought of was Sumu.\nAt that moment, Sumu was leisurely\neating lobster. Feeling Yong Dona&lt;unk&gt;s\ngaze, he said lightly, \"Hm, this lobster\nis not bad. Who asked you how the shrimp\nare? I'm asking if we can go back.\nJasmine is still waiting for me. Aren't\nyou always so smart? Do you think what\nthose two said is true? Yong Dongqing\nwas on the verge of a breakdown, hoping\nto get the answer he wanted from Sumu.\nHowever, Sumu replied, \"I don't think\nMr. Who is the kind of person who would\nlie.\" \"Thump!\" Yong Doning, pale-faced,\npllopped down on the stool.\nUnexpectedly, Su Mu changed the subject.\nHowever, there are ways to get out. Upon\nhearing this, Yong Donging stood up\nabruptly, staring intently at Su Mu with\neyes full of anticipation. Not only him,\nbut everyone present also stopped what\nthey were doing and stared intently at\nSumu. What method? Yang Donging&lt;unk&gt;s\nvoice trembled slightly. Sumu put down\nthe clean lobster shell in his hand,\nglanced at everyone, and smiled.\nIt's&lt;unk&gt; simple. Since this nightmare\nhas been affected by the power of the\nsea god, why not just leave this dream?\nNo. What are you talking about? If what?\nWho? Jess said is true, then this place\nhas already been affected by the sea\ngod, and it's impossible to leave. He\ndidn't mean leaving here and returning\nto reality, but the black mist.\nMuing&lt;unk&gt;s clear voice rang out as she\nlooked at Sumu with burning eyes. Sumu\nwiped his hands with a napkin and\npraised, \"It seems there are some\nintelligent people among you.\" His words\ncaused everyone present to frown, but no\none made a sound attack. Instead, they\nwaited for Su Mu to continue. Miss Mu\nguessed correctly. The solution I\nsuggested is to go into the black mist.\nThis place is affected by the power of\nthe sea god, but the world inside the\nblack mist is not. This means that\nentering the black mist will allow us to\nget rid of the sea god's influence. Tch.\nA man with a scar on his face scoffed. I\nthought you had some brilliant idea.\nEveryone knows that the black mist is\nextremely dangerous. Nobody knows what's\ninside. Legend has it that even a gold\nlevel expert who enters it cannot come\nback alive. You call this a solution?\nIt's clearly just sending them to their\ndeaths. Sumu smiled slightly. There are\nother nightmares inside. The scarred man\nscoffed. How do you know? Have you been\nthere? Of course, I've been there. Upon\nhearing this, the entire hall fell\nslightly silent. Many of the nightmare\napostles present were stunned, looking\nat Su Mu with disbelief. Everyone knows\nthe danger of the black mist. Even gold\nlevel experts dare not go there. Yet,\nSumu claims to have been there. How is\nthat possible? Anyone can brag. You say\nyou've been there, but how can you prove\nit? Sumu pushed up his brown tinted\nglasses, obscuring the crystallin blue\nlight within them. He smiled and said,\n\"With your abilities, you're probably\nnot worthy of me proving myself to you.\"\n\"What did you say?\" The scarred man\nroared in fury, immediately, pulling out\na pistol loaded with mythal bullets and\npointing it at Sumu. Say it again if you\ndare. Believe me, I'll shoot you dead.\nNightmare apostles are a group of people\nwho teeter on the brink of life and\ndeath, so it's hard to expect them to\nhave a good temper. A glint of\ncrystallin blue light flashed in Sumu's\neyes as he calmly said, \"You'd better\nmake sure you know exactly what you're\nholding before you fire.\" The scarred\nman froze, glancing instinctively at the\ngun in his hand. He was immediately\nterrified. That wasn't a pistol at all.\nIt was clearly a red and black venomous\nsnake with its tongue flicking out. The\nvenomous snake bared its fangs and\nlunged to bite his hand. \"Ah,\" he\nexclaimed, jerking the venomous snake\nfrom his hand. \"Clang!\" The pistol made\na dull thud as it struck the hard\nground. \"This?\" The scarred man's face\nturned pale, then read, \"You've tricked\nme. Enough.\" Finance Minister Pang Yang,\nwho was eating, suddenly shouted, \"What\nhe said is true. I possess a bronze law\ncalled liar detection, which can\ndistinguish between truth and lies. I\ncan prove that what Mr. Sue said is\ntrue. He really went into the black fog.\nThe scarred man who was about to pick up\nthe pistol suddenly turned pale. His\nface was filled with disbelief. He had\nheard of the bronze law of\ndistinguishing truth from lies before.\nIt could indeed distinguish lies. But if\nwhat Sumu said was true, wouldn't that\nmean that the other party's strength was\nat least comparable to a gold level\nexpert? Chapter 156. The carefully\nfabricated truth. An eerie silence fell\nover the room. You could hear a pin\ndrop. Various complex gazes focused on\nSumu. Shock, apprehension, ecstasy,\nfear. The fear naturally came from the\nscarred man. He had just bent down to\npick up the gun when he suddenly heard\nPangyang&lt;unk&gt;s words. His face turned\nextremely pale and his body even\ntrembled slightly. He seemed to freeze,\nunsure whether to pick up the gun or\nnot. Mr. Su is a gold level\ntranscendent. King Hu Jia suddenly spoke\nup, breaking the silence in the room.\nSumu took a small sip of coconut wine\nand parted her lips slightly. No, Hu\nJia&lt;unk&gt;s eyes flickered. Please forgive\nmy impertinence. But how did you enter\nthe black mist and come back alive? You\nhave indeed been a bit presumptuous. Hu\nJia. The scarred man carefully picked up\nthe pistol, silently returned to his\nseat and kept his head down without\nsaying a word, as if afraid of being\nnoticed by Sumu. No one present was a\nfool. They knew very well that Sumu was\nsomeone who could return alive from the\nblack mist. And even if he wasn't a gold\nlevel expert, he was definitely not\nsomeone to be trifled with. Others might\nbe wary of Sumu, but Yong Dona wasn't.\nHis face was filled with ecstatic joy.\nThen what are we waiting for? Let's head\nstraight into the black mist and leave\nthe nightmare world. The group looked at\neach other, and although some of them\nwere indeed eager to return to reality,\nno one echoed their sentiments. It's not\nthat they don't want to go back, but the\nrisks are too great. That's the black\nmist. Even gold level experts dare not\ngo there, so how could they? Even with\nthe example of Su Mu returning alive,\nthey are still afraid. Just because\nothers can return alive doesn't mean\nthey can, too. Yong Dongqing was taken\naback by everyone's reaction. What's\nwith those expressions? Don't you want\nto go back? Do you really want to live\non this island forever? His gaze swept\nacross everyone's faces, and those whose\neyes were drawn either lowered their\nheads or avoided his gaze with no one\nresponding directly. \"You, I'm going\nback,\" Muing suddenly said. The girl who\nlooked like she was from a manga spoke\ncalmly, but her voice revealed an\nunwavering determination. She looked at\nSumu. Mr. Su, if you really intend to go\nto the black mist, count me in. Sumu\nglanced at Muing. She didn't look\nthreatening at all. I am a silver tier 1\ntranscendent and I will not hold you\nback. Besides, since I have decided to\ngo to the black mist, I will naturally\ntake responsibility for my own life and\ndeath. If I really encounter a crisis,\nMr. Sue does not need to save me.\nEveryone was slightly surprised. No one\nexpected that Muing, who seemed to pose\nthe least threat, was actually a silver\nlevel expert. The most important thing\nwas her attitude. She truly disregarded\nlife and death. Sumu nodded, which was\nconsidered as his approval of Muing.\nPerhaps because Muing took the lead.\nAnother nightmare apostle soon spoke up.\nCount me in. My mother is still waiting\nfor me in the real world. I have to go\nback. Damn it. What a coward. I'm going\nto. Even if I die, I'll die a glorious\ndeath, not a pathetic old age here,\nshouted a burly, fierce looking man with\na buzzcut, who had remained silent all\nalong. Sutley observed the group that\nhad reached a consensus, his eyes\ngleaming. He suddenly laughed loudly.\nPeople really can't be compared. I never\nthought that the nightmare that has\nplagued me for 10 years would be solved\nby Mr. Sue as soon as he arrived. If Mr.\nSue really decides to leave, I am\nwilling to provide you with a ship free\nof charge to send you out to sea. The\nblack fog lies deep in the ocean. I will\nalso provide several experienced sailors\nto help you navigate the ship. And what\nabout you? Don't you want to go back?\nYong Donging asked. Hu Jia chuckled\nself-deprecatingly. I'm not afraid of\nyou laughing at me for saying this, but\nif I had met Mr. Su 5 years ago, I might\nhave taken the risk, but now I've been\ntoo comfortable here for too long and\nhave lost my edge. I'm terrified just\nthinking about facing countless undead\nsea monsters and unknown dangers in the\nblack fog after I go out to sea.\nActually, I had long ago planned to live\nmy whole life in the land of the sea.\nThink about it. Being a nightmare\napostle means you could die at any\nmoment. Even if you survive this\nnightmare world, what about next time\nand the time after that? No one can be\nso lucky forever. As far as I know, no\nnightmare apostle in this world has ever\nlived more than 10 years. I'm the first\none, and because I've always lived on\nthis island, and I want to live on, I\nwon't leave. The king's self-deprecating\nwords subtly extinguished the courage\nthat everyone had finally mustered. Yes,\nnightmare apostles don't live long and\nwill die in the nightmare world sooner\nor later. But if they live on this\nisland, they won't have to experience\nother nightmares and can live\npeacefully. Some people began to show\nhesitation. Hu Gia smiled slightly and\nsaid, \"Whether you leave or stay, I will\nsupport your decision. I will provide\nboats for those who decide to leave, and\nI will arrange official positions and\nwomen for those who decide to stay.\"\nAlthough the Sea Kingdom is lacking in\nresources and not as exciting as the\nreal world, it still has a population of\nover 100,000 with women making up more\nthan half of them more than enough to\nsatisfy everyone. Upon hearing this,\neveryone was even more tempted. Should\nthey return to reality where their lives\nwere precarious or enjoy their twilight\nyears in the Sea Kingdom? The banquet\nsoon came to an end and King Hughes\narranged accommodations for everyone in\nthe castle, boasting that ships would be\nseen setting sail early the next\nmorning. As everyone settled in, one by\none, young women were led to their\nrooms. Sumu's room was also filled with\na woman, probably because Hujia thought\nhe was the strongest. So, the woman he\narranged was the most beautiful among\nthem. Sumu sized up the woman in front\nof him. Unlike the dark skin of the\npeople outside who were exposed to the\nsun, the woman's skin was not very fair.\nBut at least it was a healthy wheat\ncolor. She was nearly 1.7 m tall,\ndressed in a bikini, and had a beautiful\nappearance. In the real world, she would\nbe considered a model who could walk the\nrunway. Lord Sue, the woman walked over\nwith a charming smile, reaching out to\nuntie the strap of her breasts as she\nwent. His majesty, the king sent me to\nserve you. I hope you will pay your\nrespects to the chief. As the crystallin\nblue light flashed in Sumu&lt;unk&gt;s eyes,\nthe woman's charming smile vanished,\nreplaced by an expressionless face.\nState your purpose. I have come to serve\nyou by order of his majesty, the king.\nSumu smiled slightly. Things were\ngetting more and more interesting. He\ncould sense that there was something\nwrong with the king. But the king had\nbeen telling the truth from beginning to\nend. Even the answers he got from\nhypnotizing the soldiers and maids were\nperfectly correct. The sea kingdom\nseemed to be a peaceful, happy, and\nfriendly land for outsiders with evil\nresiding in the sea monsters. Good and\nevil were clearly defined here, just\nlike in a fairy tale. Unfortunately, he\ndidn't believe it because such a country\ndoesn't even exist in reality, let alone\nin a nightmare. What's truly interesting\nis not an impeccable lie, but a\ncarefully crafted truth. Chapter 157.\nThe celestial venerable of immortality\nas a bodyguard. Sumu left the room,\nleaving the woman alone inside. He\nwandered aimlessly through the castle,\nhis senses settling on his own soul. The\nazure light, unique to the celestial\nvenerable of immortality, was still\nspreading across his soul, and the\nseveral immortal sea monsters he had\nencountered earlier had not been able to\nstop the azure light in the slightest.\nIt's like an adult walking down the\nstreet, and you want to block their\npath. So, you send out a few ants to\nblock their way. But the adult doesn't\nstop walking. doesn't even notice the\nants, just steps on them and continues\non their way. The siren's role wasn't to\nblock the azure light, but rather to\nprovide Sumu with a completely new\nperspective since his soul had already\nbeen pre-ordained by the eternal\nheavenly venerable and would be\ncompletely controlled within 3 days. It\nsounded terrible. However, if you looked\nat it from another angle, his soul would\nbe invincible during those three days.\nIt is immune to any soul-related\nattacks. How could something\npredetermined by the eternal heavenly\nvenerable be defiled by anything else?\nIn other words, the celestial venerable\nof longevity was his bodyguard for 3\ndays. Having a god as a bodyguard sounds\nquite interesting. Upon realizing this,\nSumu couldn't help but smile, a smile\nspreading across his face. Judging from\nyour expression, you don't seem worried\nat all about going to see tomorrow. A\nclear, slightly childlike female voice\nrang out, sitting by a wooden fence,\nenjoying the sea breeze. The damp sea\nbreeze ruffled her hair and made her\nplaid skirt dance. She was very thin and\npetite, as if she could be blown away by\nthe sea breeze at any moment. It's less\nabout worry and more about anticipation.\nSumu leaned against the fence, feeling\nthe incredibly real sea breeze from his\nnightmare. Mr. Su is indeed\nextraordinary. By the way, why did you\ncome out? Perhaps the woman the king\nsent you didn't meet your standards. Hm.\nNot good to look at. Sumu's honesty\nsurprised Muing slightly. She had\nthoughts Sumu would pretend and say\nsomething like that he wasn't a casual\nperson. At that moment, laughter from\nfinance minister Pang Yang and a woman's\nexclamation suddenly came from the room\nbehind them. Your majesty, what are you\ndoing dressed up so elaborately so late\nat night? Mind your own business and get\nout of the way. Let me guess, you\nshameless woman. You must have heard\nfrom the maid that there was a handsome\nman among the strangers this time. So\nyou can't wait to throw yourself into my\narms, right? Get out of here. What I,\nthe Empress, want to do is none of your\nbusiness. The Empress's thoughts are\nwritten all over her face. If you ask\nme, the new is not as good as the old.\nNo matter how nice a stranger is, no one\ncan be as comfortable as me taking care\nof her. The sound of a table or cabinet\noverturning came from inside the room.\nBang! The door opened and the empress,\ndisheveled, ran out. Ping Yang grabbed\nher slender waist and was about to speak\nwhen he noticed that she suddenly\nstopped struggling. He looked up and saw\nSu Mu and Muing. He was takenback at\nfirst, then laughed and said, \"Mr. Su\nand Miss Mu have such refined tastes.\nHow about we join them?\" The queen is\nthe most beautiful woman in the sea\nkingdom. Muing frowned, her eyes filled\nwith undisguised disgust. The empress\nglanced at Sumu shily, her heart\nfluttering and her expression filled\nwith anticipation. Sumu smiled with\ninterest. \"Mr. Pang, aren't you worried\nabout angering the king by doing this?\"\nPing Yong waved his hand dismissively.\nI'm taking care of my sister-in-law for\nLahu. Why would he be angry? Mr. Su, you\ndon't need to worry about this. Feel\nfree to come. Lahu is a very good\nperson. This is nothing. I won't disturb\nMr. Pangs enjoyment any longer. Pingyong\nstopped trying to persuade her and\npulled the empress back to her room. The\nempress was very reluctant and looked at\nSumu several times with lingering\naffection until the door closed, thus\nending their gaze. Not long after,\nunhealthy noises began to emanate from\nthe room. \"Muing remained\nexpressionless, showing no sign of\nanything a miss. \"Huia has a problem,\"\nshe suddenly whispered. \"The sea kingdom\nalso has a problem.\" Sumu gazed at the\npitch black sea. The sea at night was\nterrifying, like a gaping m ready to\nswallow everything at any moment. The\ninky waters surged, and no one knew how\nmany terrifying creatures lurked within.\nI've been in the sea kingdom for 2 days\nand I haven't seen a single old man.\nIt's as if the old men here have\ndisappeared. And the women here are\nstrange, too. They don't have to go out\nto sea or work. It seems like their only\ntask is to please men and then have\nchildren. The strangest thing was the\nking. He didn't act like a king at all.\nHe not only didn't have the heirs of a\nking, but he also had an unusually good\ntemper. Logically, every so often the\nsea kingdom would be invaded by\nnightmare apostles. Unable to leave,\nthey would inevitably fight for power\nand profit here. This is the inherent\nweakness of human nature. Yet no one\nvied for Hujia's position because he,\nthe king, was merely a figurehead and\nnever dealt with state affairs. Even the\nherum was open to selection by\nministers. His power was less than that\nof the ministers below him. He was\nessentially a mascot. So naturally, no\none wanted to overthrow him. Mr. Su, are\nyou listening? Muing raised an eyebrow\nand looked at Sumu, who had been\nadmiring the scenery. The wind is\npicking up. Sumu slowly withdrew his\ngaze, gently smoothing the wrinkles on\nhis clothes caused by the sea breeze. He\nturned to Muing and smiled. Miss Moo,\nall your doubts will be answered\ntomorrow. Good night. Muing&lt;unk&gt;s brows\nfurrowed deeper and deeper as she\nwatched that tall, elegant figure walk\nstep by step into the darkness and\nfinally disappear completely from sight.\nShe had no idea what Sumu was thinking.\nThe next day, early morning, the group\nsaw the king again. King Hu Jia greeted\neveryone warmly. How did you all get\nsome rest last night? Those with thick\nskin nodded in satisfaction, while those\nwith thin skin avoided eye contact. It\nseems you are all quite satisfied. I\nhave done my best as host. Now, I will\nget straight to the point. The ship is\nready. It is a royal ship of the Sea\nKingdom. Absolutely the best. It is\nanchored on the West Coast. May I ask\nwhich of you were preparing to set sail\nin search of the black mist? Compared to\nyesterday's enthusiasm, everyone was\nnoticeably quieter today, with several\nof those who had boasted about going to\nsea yesterday now cowering in fear.\nHumph coward. Muing snorted coldly and\nstepped out from the crowd. I'm going to\nsee. As the only woman in the group, she\nhad witnessed the men's behavior at\nnight yesterday and was already very\ndisgusted by it. Now that no one dared\nto stand up, she spoke out even more\nbluntly. Faced with Muing's mockery,\nseveral people lowered their heads in\nsilence. It wasn't out of shame, but\nmainly because Muing was a silver level\nfirst tier transcendent, and they dared\nnot contradict her. At this moment, Hu\nJia stepped in to smooth things over.\nMiss Moo&lt;unk&gt;s courage is commendable,\nand I admire it very much. However,\neveryone has their own ambitions, and it\nis not appropriate to force them. After\nall, not everyone in this world is a\nhero, and we are just one of the masses.\nWe admire heroes, but that does not mean\nwe want to become heroes. I think that\nwhile heroes certainly deserve praise,\nvaluing life is not wrong either.\nHujia's words ease the tension on\neveryone's faces slightly. Chapter 158.\nThe horrifying truth. I'm not a hero. I\njust want to go home. Yong Donging\nstepped forward without hesitation. It\nseems there are only the three of us\nleft. Sumu slowly walked out, leaning on\nhis snake patterned wooden cane with his\nunchanging smile on his face. and me.\nThe burly buzzcut man from yesterday\nstrode out, head held high. This\ngod-forsaken place. Let whoever wants to\nstay stay. I'm not staying. Hu Jian\nnarrowed his eyes slightly. Looking at\nthe four people in front of him, a\nbarely perceptible glint of shrewdness\nflashing in his eyes. He laughed loudly.\nSince the four of you are already\nprepared, I will not try to persuade you\nany further. Please follow me. Wait a\nminute. Muching suddenly interrupted,\nstaring intently at the smiling hujia.\nBefore we set sail, I have a few\nquestions I want to ask. After all, I\ndon't want to die at sea for no reason.\nHu Jia's smile remained unchanged. Miss\nMu, do you want to ask about the\nstrength and number of the undying sea\nmonsters? I want to ask you, Muing was\ntoo lazy to pretend and said bluntly, I\ndon't trust you. I think you must have\nsome ulterior motive, and there might\neven be a problem with the ship you\nprepared in advance. Hu Jia was taken\naback. Miss Mu, what makes you say that?\nDid I do something wrong? I believe I\nhave treated everyone with sincerity.\nBesides, we are all from the same\nhometown and have no conflict of\ninterest. Why would I tamper with the\nship? Hey, Lu, I told you you look like\na cunning person. No one would think\nyou're a good guy, but you never\nbelieved me. Pangyong stepped forward\nand looked at Muing saying, \"Miss Mu, I\nknow your doubts. Lahu has indeed been\nhiding something. Let me be frank. Lau\nwho doesn't actually want you guys to go\nto see Pangyong. You're really\nsomething.\" Hu Jia sighed but ultimately\ndidn't stop him. Mu Ching said coldly,\n\"What do you mean by not wanting us to\ngo to sea?\" Pangyang glanced around and\nsaw the weary look on everyone's faces.\nWithout keeping them in suspense, he\nimmediately told them the truth. As\nyou've probably noticed, there are no\nelderly people in the Sea Kingdom. And\nthe so-called sea stone that supposedly\ndrives away sea monsters is just an\nordinary stone. In fact, the Sea Kingdom\nis not as peaceful as you might imagine.\nTo put it bluntly, the entire sea\nkingdom is nothing more than livestock\nkept by sea monsters. What? Upon hearing\nthis, everyone gasped in surprise.\nLivestock? Muing s delicate eyebrows\nfurrowed tightly as if she had made a\nconnection to something. Yes, they are\nlivestock. Pingyong sighed repeatedly.\nDo you know the origin of the immortal\nsea monster? The very first sea monster\nwas actually a fisherman who drowned in\nthe sea. The ocean is an extension of\nthe sea god's power. on the sea. The\nsouls of all those who drown belong to\nthe sea god. Once the sea god takes away\ntheir souls, the curse of immortality\nwill spread and the corpses of the\ndrowned will become undead sea monsters.\nThey will constantly attack living\nbeings and plunder souls for the sea\ngod. This plunder is like a plague.\nThose whose souls are stolen by the\nsiren eventually become siren\nthemselves. What? That's just like the\nzombies in the movies? Someone exclaimed\nin horror. Pingong gave a ry smile. I\nwish they were zombies. At least you\ncould kill them by blowing their heads\noff. But the undying siren is cursed by\nthe sea god. That's the power of the\ngods. Mortals can't kill them at all.\nSo, we could only watch helplessly as\nthe number of sirens increased,\nattacking the sea kingdom time and\nagain. Old and I along with the other\nnightmare apostles fought desperately to\nstop them, but it was all in vain. Who\ncan defeat immortal monsters? Then why\ndon't you build high walls to keep the\nsea monsters out? Although these sea\nmonsters are immortal, they are not very\npowerful. Mucci encountered. Do you\nthink we didn't think of this method?\nIt's useless. Completely useless. The\nsiren isn't strong, but there are not\nonly siren in the ocean, but also some\nlarge sea beasts. Their predecessors\ninclude sharks, whales, octopuses, and\nso on. If it were just them, that would\nbe one thing. But the most terrifying\nthing is that there's a sea god's\nfollower in the sea. It's the most\npowerful being in this area. The high\nwalls can't stop it at all. Not even old\nwho, a silver rank expert. Ping\nYang&lt;unk&gt;s words filled everyone with\ndespair. And they never imagined that so\nmany terrifying beings, including those\nfavored by the gods, were hidden in the\nsea. Then how did you survive? Yong\nDonging asked, his face turning pale.\nHei, it's embarrassing to say. Because\nof the constant attacks from the sirens,\nthe population of the sea kingdom\ndwindled until there were less than\n10,000 people left. At the critical\nmoment, it was old who stepped forward.\nDon't think that old who is a nice guy\nor a bit of a coward, but he's a really\ngood person, and he'll really step up\nwhen something happens. He ventured\nalone into the deep sea to negotiate\nwith the sea gods retinue. Telling them\nthat once the sea kingdom was destroyed,\nthey would no longer be able to harvest\nsouls. Muing&lt;unk&gt;s face pad slightly as\nshe gritted her teeth and said, \"So, you\nmade a deal with the sea gods retinue to\nhelp them raise humans?\" Little girl, I\nknow what you're thinking, but what can\nwe do? Ping Yang&lt;unk&gt;s face twisted into\na ferocious expression. We're facing\ngods. Gods? We can only make a deal with\nthe sea gods retinue, allowing the\nhumans on the island to multiply and\nthen sacrificing them to the sea\nmonsters every so often in exchange for\npeace. That damn seastone was just a\ntool who came up with to reassure\npeople. The truth is, we made a deal\nwith the sea gods retinue, telling the\nsea monsters not to kill those who\npossessed the sea stone so that the\npeople would think that the sea monsters\nalso had weaknesses. Because people\nwon't reproduce when they're in a state\nof extreme despair. We must give them\nhope. This explains everything. Why\nthere are no elderly people in the sea\nkingdom because they have all been\nsacrificed. Why sea stones, though\nordinary stones, can drive away sea\nmonsters. Because the usefulness lies\nnot in the sea stones themselves, but in\nthe secret agreement between the king\nand the sea god's retinue, and why the\nwomen here are unusually open, because\nthey want to continuously reproduce.\nPingyang&lt;unk&gt;s words completely\nshattered the fairy tale-like illusion\nsurrounding this sea kingdom. There are\nno fairy tales in this world. Fairy\ntales are all lies. That's why Lahu\ndoesn't want you to go to sea. The sea\nkingdom needs fresh people to reproduce.\nIf there are too few people, it will\neventually lead to inbreeding and\nproduce some mentally challenged\nchildren with incomplete souls. The sea\ngod's family doesn't want mentally\nchallenged children. Don't think old who\nis selfish. He's doing it for your own\ngood. Going to sea is a dead end. You\ncan't fight the endless monsters in the\nsea, nor the mysterious and powerful\nfollowers of the sea god. Rather than\ngoing to your deaths, it's better to\nstay and at least live peacefully. If\nthere are to be sacrifices, ordinary\ncitizens will be given priority, not us\nextraordinary beings. Yong Donging\ntrembled, feeling utterly bewildered.\nYou You actually chose to live like\nthis? Don't you think about your\noffspring? What's the point of\nconstantly having children? Are they\njust to be born as livestock? Ping Yang\nsaid coldly. At least the livestock can\nlive, which is better than them dying.\nBut but what's the use? The more\nsacrifices we make, the more undead sea\nmonsters we'll have, and then we'll have\nto make even more sacrifices. It's a\nvicious cycle. One day, the rate of\nchildbirth won't be able to keep up with\nthe rate of sacrifices, and then the sea\nkingdom will be finished. Yong Donging\nsaid, trembling. Pingyong clenched his\nfists tightly, his fat face contorted\nwith rage. Then tell me what the hell we\nshould do. Tell me, what can you people\ndo besides stand on your moral high\nground and criticize us? Chapter 159.\nYong Dong&lt;unk&gt;s promotion.\nPangyang&lt;unk&gt;s roars silenced everyone.\nThe bloody facts were right in front of\nthem, and people had no choice but to do\nnothing. Yong Dongqing gritted his\nteeth, veins bulging on his face. He\nhated his powerlessness once again. The\nlast time he felt powerless was in\nTinking's nightmare. He didn't expect to\nfeel it again so soon. Nightmares.\nNightmares. These damn nightmares. He\nhated this place not only because his\nown life was precarious, but also\nbecause he had to witness despair time\nand time again and struggle and sink\ninto despair. Suddenly, a vast net\nseemingly capable of encompassing heaven\nand earth appeared in Yong Doning&lt;unk&gt;s\nfield of vision. It was shimmering with\nbillions of brilliant stars. And on one\nof these stars, which looked as if it\nwere cast in steel, a line connected to\nhis body. He suddenly realized that this\nwas the bronze law. And the steel star\nthat connected him was the iron heart.\nThe next moment, another star in the\nbronze law, shimmering with warm white\nlight, lowered its radiance and slowly\nfell upon him. Buzz. A strange tremor\nsurged through his body as if countless\nmysterious pieces of knowledge were\nflooding into his mind. A look of\nenlightenment flashed in his eyes.\nFeeling the changes in his body, he knew\nthat this change was called endless\nrecovery. Yes, he has advanced to bronze\ntier 2 and obtained bronze loss sequence\n8 unending recovery. It should have been\na happy occasion to be promoted to\nbronze 2, but Yong Doning felt no joy at\nall at this moment. Even though he had\nbeen looking forward to the promotion\nfor a long time, he had already shown\nsigns of advancement in the real world\nsince he had fully mastered the bronze\nlaw sequence 9 iron heart. As the chosen\none, he only needed an opportunity to\nadvance. And now that opportunity had\narrived. The moment unending recovery\nappeared. A soft white light flashed\nacross Yong Donging&lt;unk&gt;s body and a\nwarm current like soaking in a hot\nspring flowed through his entire body.\nAll the minor injuries he had suffered\nbefore as well as the damage caused by\nhis long-term bad habits such as staying\nup late and indulging in sex were wiped\naway at this moment. His body seemed to\nhave been reborn, becoming incredibly\nhealthy, and his physical abilities were\nalso enhanced to a certain extent.\nAlthough he couldn't compare to the\nprevious Iron Heart, he was still a\nforce to be reckoned with. Bronze Eye\nand Bronze 2 is not simply 1 + 1 equals\ntwo. The two extraordinary abilities\ncomplement and promote each other. Even\nif a superhuman with iron will and a\nsuperhuman with unending recovery\nattacked together, they would absolutely\nnot be able to defeat Yong Doning, who\nis at the bronze 2 level. Yong\nDonging&lt;unk&gt;s extraordinary advancement\nattracted everyone's attention, and many\npeople showed envy. Being able to\nadvance on his own without relying on\nextraordinary potions speaks volumes.\nEven when Sumu first became a superhum,\nhe only awakened the immaculate heart\nwith the help of external forces.\nCongratulations on Mr. Yang&lt;unk&gt;s\npromotion. Hu Jia clapped his hands, his\nface full of sincere congratulations.\nYong Donging forced a smile, a very\nstrange one. Mr. Yang is a chosen one\nwith a promising future ahead of him. So\nwhy bother venturing into the deep sea?\nYong Dona shook his head and said\nfirmly, \"I must go back. There are\npeople in the real world who are very\nimportant to me waiting for me.\" \"Mr.\nYang, you misunderstood. I didn't mean\nto stop you from going, but rather to\nwait and go later.\" Wait a minute. Yong\nDonging was taken aback. Hu Jia\ncontinued. Think about it. You are the\nchosen one. You can advance on your own\nwithout relying on extraordinary\npotions. It is very difficult to advance\non your own in the real world because\nthe laws there are not obvious, but it\nis very easy in the nightmare world. The\nsea kingdom is simply the chosen land\nfor you. If you simply live peacefully\nhere and continuously hone your\nabilities, over time you can become a\nsilver rank expert within a few years.\nWouldn't your chances of success be\ngreatly increased? Then before setting\noff for the deep sea, a hint of\nhesitation flashed across Yong\nDoning&lt;unk&gt;s face. He suddenly realized\nthat what the king said made a lot of\nsense. But Hu Jia patted Yong Doning on\nthe shoulder earnestly. Mr. Yong, I know\nwhat you're worried about. It's nothing\nmore than the fact that you can't go\nback for a long time, which will make\nyour relatives in the real world worry.\nBut everything has its advantages and\ndisadvantages. Think about it. Rather\nthan taking a risk now and risking your\nlife, it's better to wait a few years.\nIs it more serious to make your family\nwait for several years or to never see\nyou again? I Yong Doning clinched his\nfists tightly, but in the end, he didn't\nsay anything. He hesitated. Seeing his\nhesitation, Hu Jia smiled slightly. A\nperson's will is easily worn down. When\nyou finally muster up the courage, you\nare suddenly hindered by various\nconcerns, and your courage will decline.\nAfter you have enjoyed the gentle\nembrace of the sea kingdom for a few\nyears, your will will be worn down\nagain. Just as Hujia thought he had\nsucceeded, a calm voice rang out. Let's\ngo, Yong Daing. Leaning on his snake\npatterned wooden cane, Sumu slowly\nwalked towards the west coast, his\nfigure growing ever more distant from\nthe group of people who hesitated in\nplace. Yong Donging was stunned,\nwatching Sumu&lt;unk&gt;s departing figure.\nAll her worries vanished in an instant\nand she chased after him almost without\nthinking. Wait for me. Hu Jia watched\nthe two figures leave, his face\ndarkening. Just then, another figure\npassed by him. It was Muing. No one knew\nwhy she insisted on going back, even at\nthe risk of her life. Perhaps everyone\nhas their own choices and their own\nconcerns. Muing s choice was to run\ntowards the one she cared about. Hu J's\nface darkened further. But when he\nturned around, his expression returned\nto normal and he said with admiration,\n\"Mr. Sue and the other two are indeed\ncourageous. But that doesn't mean our\nchoice was wrong. We just wanted to\nlive. What's wrong with that?\"\nGentlemen, a tall imposing figure\nstepped out from the crowd. It was the\ncrew cut man who had been urging others\nto leave. Seeing the crew cut man take\naction, Hu Jian narrowed his eyes. He\nremembered that the man's name was Lu\nDong. He was not weak, but he was just a\nbrute. After arriving in the sea\nkingdom, he had been complaining about\nthis and that and kept saying that he\nwanted to leave this god-forsaken place.\nHe never expected that this reckless man\nwould dare to stand up when he knew how\ndangerous the deep sea was. Others want\nto go back because they have people they\ncan't let go of in the real world. What\ndo you Lu Dong have? In the past few\ndays, Hujia hadn't heard Lu Dong say a\nsingle word about missing home or\nlonging for anyone. All he had heard was\nhis disdain for the sea kingdom, as if\nhe wanted to go back simply because the\nsea kingdom was too barren and didn't\noffer as many things as the real world.\nMr. Lu, are you going too? Huia asked.\nChapter 160. Let him be strong. Lu Dong\nLeon cursed. Didn't I tell you? This\ngodforsaken place is no place for anyone\nto stay, but I can't stand it. Damn it.\nI choked on a fishbone when I was a kid,\nso I hate eating fish more than\nanything. And here in this god-forsaken\nplace, I'm eating fish nine times a day.\nHu Jia's eyes flickered. Mr. Louu, the\nsea kingdom is indeed not as good as the\nreal world, but at least you can survive\nhere. There are many powerful monsters\nin the sea, as well as the sea god's\nfollowers. You should think carefully\nabout whether it is more important to\nenjoy yourself or to survive. Nonsense.\nOf course, enjoyment is more important.\nWhat's the point of living if I can't\nenjoy myself? I'd rather be an emperor\nfor a day than a beggar for a lifetime.\nStop trying to persuade me and get out\nof my way. Hujia was a little stunned.\nHe didn't expect that so many oddballs\nwould appear among the nightmare\napostles this time. He could understand\nthat others had ties and wanted to go\nback, but what kind of monster is Lu\nDong? You can enjoy this even in a land\nby the sea with the women here. Lu Dong\nsaid disdainfully, \"You really haven't\neaten fine food before. The women here\nare dark-skinned and strong and their\nmouths smell like the sea. Only you\nwould be interested in them. Hujia. He\nwas genuinely angry. This brute was\ntruly impervious to reason. But there\nare many powerful monsters in the sea.\nLu Dong had already shaken off Hu\nJia&lt;unk&gt;'s hand that was trying to stop\nhim and stroed after Su Mu and the\nothers, his rough voice drifting from\nafar. Let him be strong as he wants. I\nam Lu Dong. Watching the four figures\ndisappear into the distance, Hu\nJia&lt;unk&gt;s face had become\nexpressionless, and he looked at them as\nif they were dead men. At this moment,\nPangyang put his arm around Hu Jia's\nshoulder and said, \"Forget it. You can't\npersuade a damned ghost with good words.\nLet them be. I heard you recently took a\nnew concubine. I'll help you train her.\"\nSigh. Hu Jia said with regret. I really\ndon't want to watch them die. Why can't\nthey stay and live a good life? On the\nhigh seas, a boat carrying a dozen or so\npeople is sailing. The boat is not big\nand its hull is mainly made of wood and\nmetal. It is about the size of a small\nyacht in the real world, but it is\nactually much simpler than a yacht. This\nis already considered the best ship in\nthe sea kingdom, reserved for royal use.\nOn the deck, the sailors given by the\nking were busy moving about. Although\nthey were experienced, their faces were\nfilled with fear and anxiety after\nlearning that their destination was the\ndeep sea. The only comfort they had was\nthe seastone they wore on their chests\nand the huge sea stone hanging on the\nhall. Inside the cabin, Sumu and his\nthree companions gathered together to\ndiscuss their upcoming trip. We're&lt;unk&gt;\nall in the same boat now, so let's each\nexplain our abilities. That way, we can\ncooperate better if we encounter\ndanger,\" Sumu instructed, acting like a\nleader. Muing and the others didn't\nthink there was anything wrong with it.\nAs a powerful figure who could return\nfrom the black mist, Su Mu should be in\ncharge. Even Lu Dong, who seemed\ndifficult to get along with, did not\ncome out to compete for command of the\nfleet. Let me go first. Sumu began to\nlie skillfully. I have many abilities,\nbut I won't go into detail. My main\nability is annihilation eye, which can\nannihilate at the atomic level. Muing\nand Lu Dong were immediately startled.\nAnnihilation at the atomic level. What\nkind of law is this? It's terrifying, Lu\nDong Leong exclaimed, his tiger-like\neyes filled with undisguised shock. Mr.\nSu&lt;unk&gt;s laws are not within the known\nsequence. He truly deserves to be a\npowerful figure who returned from the\nblack mist. Muing&lt;unk&gt;s tense face\nrelaxed slightly. As a member of the\nfleet, she naturally hoped that her\nteammates would be as strong as possible\nso that their chances of survival would\nbe greater. Although both were shocked\nby Sumu's powerful abilities, neither of\nthem questioned them. It would be\nsuspicious if Su Mu&lt;unk&gt;s abilities\nweren't strong enough to return from the\nblack mist. Sitting to the side, Yong\nDonging unconsciously wiggled his hips\nand lowered his head slightly. He knew\nhis acting skills were not good and was\nafraid that others would see through his\nacting. He didn't know how many\nabilities Sumu had acquired, but the\nabilities were always different and he\ncould just rattle them off off. I'll go\nnext. Muing suppressed her shock and\ntook the initiative to explain her\nability. Silver Law sequence three.\nNature's call. The ability is to control\nplants. Her remarks drew Yong\nDoning&lt;unk&gt;s attention because Yong\nDoning had finally met someone whose\nrank was lower than his. Although the\nother person was a silver rank while he\nwas a bronze rank, it did not prevent\nhim from feeling a slight surge of\nsuperiority. I'm also silver one\nsequence 18 bloody berserker. This\nability is similar to berserk mode in\ngames which can greatly increase\nstrength, speed, resistance, etc. If it\nweren't for the side effect of lowering\nintelligence and inability to\ndistinguish friend from foe after\nactivation, my sequence ranking would\ndefinitely be higher than 18. Lu Dong\nLeong seemed very dissatisfied with his\nown sequence ranking. So, he made a\npoint of explaining the meaning is\nsimple. Although my rank is low, my\ncombat ability is by no means weak. It's\njust that I might kill my teammates.\nBronze 2. My bronze laws are sequence 8,\nunending recovery, and sequence 9, iron\nwill. Yong Dongqing was a little\nembarrassed to reveal his abilities and\nlevel. It was rather shameful to\nsuddenly have a bronze two among a group\nof silver. Muing glanced at Yong\nDonging, her face showing a puzzled\nexpression, but she didn't say anything.\nLu Dong, however, couldn't keep his\nthoughts to himself and said directly,\n\"Brother Yang, I'm a little puzzled. Why\nis your extraordinary level so low? If I\nremember correctly, you were bronze\nlevel one when you first came in, and\nyou only recently broke through to\nbronze level two, right? Yong Dongqing,\nstill young at heart, retorted somewhat\ndefiantly. That's because I haven't been\na nightmare apostle for long. Give me\nsome time, and I'll be able to advance\nto silver sooner or later. Lu Dong shook\nhis head. That's not what I meant. What\nI meant was that the signs of the\nnightmare world are getting more and\nmore difficult to detect. The nightmares\nyou enter as an ordinary person are\ndefinitely different from the nightmares\nyou enter after becoming a superhuman.\nYou play games, right? Do you know about\nmatchmaking mechanisms? I'm a\nstraightforward person. Don't take it\npersonally. In general, newbies rarely\nget matched with pros in the same game.\nThe three of us are all so good. We\nshouldn't have run into you. Yong\nDoning. Damn it. You're telling me not\nto mind your words? Why don't you talk\nto Sumu directly like that? I'm also\ncurious about this. It does seem a bit\nillogical. Muching frowned. And what's\neven more illogical is that given our\ncurrent level, why would we encounter a\nlegendary deity in this nightmare? Even\nif, as Hujia said, the sea god is the\nsea itself and has never shown himself,\nit still doesn't make sense unless. She\npaused then looked at Sumu, who was\nsitting upright to the side. Chapter 161\nattack. Lu Dong Leyong instantly\nrealized something, looked sharply at\nSumu, and blurted out, \"Unless someone\nin the team is too strong. The\nmatchmaking system only includes newbies\nto maintain balance, and the nightmare\ndifficulty will increase along with that\nperson's strength.\" Both of them looked\nat Sumu, their eyes filled with deep\nshock. This could only be the reason.\nMr. Su&lt;unk&gt;s strength was too great,\ncausing the difficulty of the entire\nnightmare to increase dramatically. Sumu\nsmiled gently. Perhaps from their\nconversation, he gained a deeper\nalso realized why he had encountered a\ndeity this time because of the eternal\nlife celestial venerable. The power of\nthe eternal celestial venerable remained\nin his soul and the nightmare world\nattributed this power to itself. After\nit intruded into Yong Dongqing s\nnightmare, the balance was disrupted. Or\nperhaps it is a mutual attraction\nbetween gods. But it doesn't matter\nanymore. We've already entered. So\nanalyzing the reasons for entering is\npointless. Uh a siren. Suddenly the crew\nmembers cried out in alarm on the deck.\nEveryone's expressions hardened and they\nhurriedly went out of the cabin. They\nsaw more than a dozen undead sea\nmonsters crawling onto the deck. And\neven more sea monsters were emerging\nfrom the sea and climbing onto the ship.\nThe smell of decay filled the air and\nsea water dripped from the siren soaking\nthe deck. The crew members were thrown\ninto chaos. Someone tried to take out\nthe seastone to drive away the sea\nmonster. But as soon as he raised the\nsea stone, a black fleshy tendril\nignored it and wrapped around his hand.\nIn an instant, the man's body stiffened.\nHis skin lost its color and he fell to\nthe ground without a sound. Are\nbasically powerless against the immortal\nsea monster. Its black fleshy whiskers\ncan steal souls, and touching them is\ncertain death. Only extraordinary\nindividuals like Yong Dong could\nwithstand a few blows, but not for long.\nDon't panic. Get behind me. Lu\nDong&lt;unk&gt;s body began to expand\nstrangely, his muscles bulging and his\nskin turning crimson. He charged forward\nand easily defeated the sea monsters\nwith a single punch. But it was no use.\nThe shattered siren turned into seaater\nand flowed back into the ocean. And then\nmore and more siren climbed onto the\nship. His eyes were bloodshot and\nbloodshot, the symptoms of his berserk\nstate becoming increasingly obvious.\nDamn it, I told you not to panic. run,\nget the boat, and leave. If he knew how\nto sail a boat, he wouldn't care about\nthese people's lives or deaths. He\noverestimated these pampered citizens of\nthe sea kingdom. In the past, they\nrelied on the seastone to drive away the\nimmortal sea monsters, which meant they\nhad hardly ever fought. Now that the sea\nstone had failed, they were completely\npanicked. Some were even terrified and\nstood there waiting to die. Thump. The\nsnakeskin cane tapped lightly on the\ndeck, producing a crisp sound. Quiet.\nThe calm voice seemed to possess some\nkind of magical power. When Sumu spoke,\nthe chaotic sounds on the entire deck\nabruptly ceased. Then the panic crowd\nstrangely calmed down. They ran in an\norderly fashion, lined up, and ran into\nthe cabin to begin navigating the boat\nto escape. This bizarre scene startled\nLu Dong, who exclaimed, \"As expected of\nMr. Su.\" Binding, Muing stretched out\nher fair little hand, her fingers\nopening like flowers blooming. The next\nmoment, countless thorny vines sprouted\nfrom the ship, tightly binding the\nundead sea monsters. After binding them,\nthe thorny vines exerted their power,\nthrowing them off the ship one by one.\nAlthough her silver rank is low, it is a\nrare area of effect attack, making it\nideal for clearing out mobs. The undead\nsea monsters that had gathered in the\nsea. After the crisis was over, Lu Dong\nreturned to normal and spat into the\nsea. Damn, if these things weren't so\nunkillable, I would have killed them\nall. Yang Doning was taken aback. What\nyou said makes perfect sense. The ship\nsailed further and further away, and\nsoon the Sea Kingdom was no longer\nvisible to the group. All around them\nwas a vast ocean. Although sea monsters\nwould occasionally attack, they could\nnot cause any waves under the\nsuppression of the group's powerful\nstrength. Going out to sea doesn't seem\ndangerous. Lu Dong Leong downed his\ncoconut wine in one gulp. A look of\nsatisfaction on his face. Just as he was\nabout to casually throw the bottle into\nthe sea, a huge black shadow suddenly\nappeared in the water. The dark shadow\nrose from the seabed, growing larger and\nlarger, and the color of the shadow\nbecame darker and darker. To the naked\neye, it was dozens of meters long. The\nterrifying dark shadow on the seabed was\nseveral times larger than this ship. It\nrose from the bottom of the boat,\ncausing the surrounding water to surge\nand the boat to rock violently as if it\nmight capsize at any moment. Oh no,\nit's&lt;unk&gt; going to capsize our boat. Lu\nDong&lt;unk&gt;s expression changed\ndrastically. Mr. Su quickly tell them to\nspeed up the boat. Sumu gazed intently\nat the enormous shadow in the sea and\nsaid calmly, \"This is already the ship's\nmaximum speed.\" Bang! A giant tentacle\nover 10 m long burst out of the water\nand slammed onto the ship like a fallen\ngiant tree. Click. The metal reinforced\nwooden boat was immediately smashed and\ndeveloped several cracks. Then there's\nthe second and third points. Seven\ntentacles landed on the ship, tightening\nand binding it tightly, causing the ship\nto creek and groan under the string. \"Go\nto hell!\" Lu Dong Leong roared, his skin\ninstantly turning crimson, and he\nslammed it at one of the thick\ntentacles. Bang! The terrifying force\nsmashed the tentacle in half, the broken\nend already reduced to a bloody pulp.\n\"No!\" Muing exclaimed as several vines\nsprouted from under Lu Dong&lt;unk&gt;s feet\nand wrapped around his body. \"What are\nyou doing?\" Lu Dong Leong glared angrily\nand was about to tear the vines off his\nbody. \"You can't&lt;unk&gt;t keep smashing it.\nThe ship can't withstand your force.\" Lu\nDong Leong was startled and looked\ntowards the spot where the tentacle had\nbroken off, where he saw a large hole in\nthe deck. Damn it. His anger surged, and\nhe dared not unleash his full strength.\nIf this were on land, I could take on 10\nof these guys. Although the bloodbath\nskill would lower his intelligence, he\nhadn't used his full strength yet, so\nhis intelligence hadn't dropped to zero.\nHe also knew that once the ship was gone\nand he fell into the sea, it would be\nthe siren's domain. Helpless, Lu Dong\nLeong could only try to move the\ntentacles with his hands, hoping to\nthrow them back into the sea. Muing, on\nthe other hand, kept manipulating the\nvines, repairing the ship that was about\nto break down as if she were knitting a\nsweater. As for Yong Doning, he was\nfrantically attacking one of the\ntentacles, his steel-like arm plunging\ninto it and tearing at it. But the\ntentacle was too huge, and he couldn't\ncause any effective damage in a short\ntime. As the situation grew increasingly\ncritical, everyone had no choice but to\nturn to the mysterious and powerful Mr.\nSu for help. Sumu did not stand idly by.\nHe was simply waiting for the black\ntentacles on the giant octopus's body to\nappear since he didn't possess any\nwide-range attack skills. Although the\nprimordial angel's eye of God is very\npowerful, its attack range is very\nsmall, making it useless against such a\nbehemoth. Moreover, fighting at sea is\nfar too restrictive. A slight mistake\ncould damage the ship while sea monsters\ncan attack at will. Seeing that the ship\nwas about to give way and the black\nfleshy tendrils had not yet emerged,\nSumu knew that he could not wait any\nlonger. So he did something that shocked\neveryone. He jumped into the sea.\nChapter 1 162. Annihilation. Mr. Su Lu\nDong exclaimed, \"Everyone knows that the\nsea is the domain of sirens, and even\nsuperhumans need to breathe. They can't\npossibly fight while treading water, can\nthey?\" Underwater, Sumu's eyes shone\nwith a crystal blue light. His powerful\nmental strength gave him unparalleled\nperception, allowing him to clearly see\nthe full appearance of the sea monster.\nIt was a gigantic octopus. Its body so\nlarge it resembled a moving black\nisland. Its skin covered in dark,\nwrinkled skin like old tree bark.\nCountless thick tentacles churned in the\nseaater, covered with suckers of varying\nsizes, like a dense network of holes,\nwhich was enough to make one's scalp\ntingle. At this moment, the octopus\nspotted Sumu and a thick tentacle swept\nacross. Sumu narrowed his eyes slightly,\nand a massive amount of spiritual power\nsurged into the silver ring on his left\nhand, causing it to burst with a faint\nlight. The next moment, this spiritual\nenergy was transformed into powerful\nphysical strength. Facing the\napproaching tentacles, he did not dodge,\nbut instead used both hands to grab them\nhard. He inserted both hands directly\ninto the suction cups on the tentacles,\nthen flipped his body to use the\nmomentum to climb up the tentacles. The\ntentacles thrashed wildly, but couldn't\nshake off Sumu at all. He pulled hard\nagain, seemingly trying to pull the\noctopus down, but because there was no\nfoothold in the sea, the powerful\nreaction force sent Sumu rushing towards\nthe octopus. This was exactly what Sumu\nwanted to achieve because he saw the\nbottom of the octopus where thousands of\nblack fleshy tentacles floated among its\ntangled tentacles. He would have a hard\ntime killing such a behemoth in the sea.\nBut his bodyguard, the eternal celestial\nvenerable, could. Like a torpedo, Sumu\npierced through layers of tentacles and\nplunged straight into the dense black\nfleshy tendrils. His body instantly\nswallowed up. The black fleshy tendrils\nsensed the arrival of the soul and\ninstinctively began to frantically coil\naround Sumu, trying to pull his soul\nout. And then nothing happened. A\nbrilliant, boundless beam of blue light,\nas if descending from a high latitude,\nflashed out. Whoosh! The island-like\noctopus monster disappeared. The\ndisappearance was so sudden that the\nsurrounding seaater seemed not to have\nreacted at all, only surging in from all\ndirections a moment later to fill the\nvacuum left by the octopus's\ndisappearance. The people on the ship\nwere startled. In their view, they only\nsaw Sumu jump into the sea, and then a\nflash of blue light appeared. The\ntentacles that had been wrapped around\nthe ship's hull were covered by the blue\nlight and disappeared in a flash. \"No,\nit's gone.\" Lu Dong Leong rushed to the\nside of the ship to check only to find\nthat the huge shadow in the sea had also\ndisappeared. He stared in disbelief,\nexclaiming in horror, \"Is this the power\nof Mr. Sue's eye of annihilation? It\nannihilated the sea monster in an\ninstant. This is simply an unreasonable\nact of annihilation.\" Muing was equally\nshocked, and she slowly pulled her small\nhand out from her bosom. Even Yong\nDoning, who knew Su well, was stunned.\nHe really had the eye of annihilation.\nJust how many laws did he possess? On\nthe vast and boundless sea, sunlight\nspills onto the shimmering surface,\ncreating layers of golden ripples.\nSuddenly, a figure emerges from the sea\nwith hair plastered to his forehead.\nWater droplets sliding down his angular\nface, sparkling in the sunlight. It was\nSumu. Sumu came to the side of the boat,\ngrabbed the metal bar used for fixing\nthe boat with one hand. His arm muscles\nbulged slightly and with a sudden burst\nof strength, he was lifted out of the\nwater like an arrow and landed on the\ndeck. Chief, a towel. A crew member who\nhad been waiting for a long time\nrespectfully handed over a white towel.\nSumu took it casually, took off his\nbrown glasses, and wiped his cheeks and\nwet hair. This was the first time\neveryone had seen the eyes hidden behind\nthe brown glasses. The eyes, like black\ngemstones, shimmerred with a deep dark\nlight. You can tell if a person has\nenergy and spirit by looking at whether\ntheir eyes have light. Sumu's eyes do\nhave light, but it's a dim and\nindistinct light, unusually deep, like a\nvortex that makes people unconsciously\nwant to lose themselves in it. Mr. Su,\nyou are truly amazing. Lu Dong Leong\nexclaimed excitedly. He was a\nstraightforward person and did not hide\nhis admiration for the strong. Let's get\nout of here quickly. The monsters in the\nsea are unkillable, and the octopus sea\nmonster will soon be back. Mu Ching\nreminded them, not forgetting their\ncurrent situation. Yes, yes, let's go\nquickly. Lu Dong Leong hurriedly urged\nthe crew. While drying his hair, Su Mu\nsaid calmly. This octopus won't come\nback because it's already dead. Dead?\nMuin&lt;unk&gt;s pink lips parted slightly.\nAren't they supposed to be invincible?\nMr. Su, do you think you can kill them?\nSumu nodded. There is no such thing as\nimmortality in this world. Even if there\nwere, it would never happen to an\noctopus. Everyone was even more shocked.\nWas the curse of immortality broken so\neasily? Was this Mr. Sue's true\nstrength? The ship continued its voyage,\nand time slowly passed. The octopus sea\nmonster truly did not return. In the\ndark depths of the sea, a humanoid\ncreature covered in slippery green\nscales stared intently at the ship. It\nhad a pair of scarlet eyes, and its back\nwas covered in countless thick black\ntendrils that seemed to bloom, silently\nsurging in the seaater. It shifted its\ngaze to the spot where the octopus sea\nmonster had disappeared. Sensing the\nresidual power in the seawater, a hint\nof apprehension appearing in its eyes.\nThe power of a god. He is also a chosen\none. But which god is he the chosen one\nof? It seems we cannot act rashly. We\nneed to continue probing. Suddenly, it\nbent down to look at the dark seabed and\nuttered strange mutterings. Buzz.\nStrange murmurss traveled with the\ncurrent to the seabed. And then a\nshocking scene unfolded. Deep in the\nocean, countless scarlet eyeballs lit\nup, some of them enormous, the largest\nreaching 10 meters in diameter. On the\nboat, Sumu did not change out of his wet\nclothes. Yong Donging asked, puzzled,\n\"Aren't you uncomfortable wearing wet\nclothes?\" Sumu shook his head, \"Because\nwe're going into the water soon.\" Yong\nDonging was taken aback. Before he could\nreact, Sumu had already walked to the\nside of the boat, looking intently into\nthe unfathomable sea. We're here. The\ncalm sea surface began to shake\nviolently the next moment, as if some\nenormous creature was about to break\nthrough the water. Such a huge commotion\nnaturally attracted everyone's\nattention. When they looked into the\nsea, they were instantly terrified to\nsee that a strange red light was shining\nin the water. The red light was very\nwide, covering an area of almost a\nkilometer, and it was getting brighter\nand brighter, as if the red light on the\nseabed was rapidly approaching the ship.\nUpon closer inspection, everyone was\nhorrified. What they saw was not red\nlight at all, but rather enormous\nscarlet eyeballs that flickered with an\neerie red glow, connecting to illuminate\na kilometer wide area of the sea.\nChapter 163. The shocking familiar of\nthe sea god. Bang! Bang! Bang! Giant\ntentacles burst from the water, dancing\nin the air like pillars supporting the\nsky. Following them, sea monsters as\nlarge as mountains slowly rose up, their\nrough skin like ancient reefs, their\nbodies radiating a dark luster. They\nsurrounded the ship, and the huge\nshadows cast by their bodies in the\nsunlight were terrifying. They were\nincredibly deformed, resembling a\nhap-hazardly pieced together\namalgamation of various fish and\noctopuses. Not only that, but along with\nthe sea monster appeared a dense swarm\nof undead sea monsters. Their bodies\nwere not fully exposed above the sea\nsurface. Only their rotting heads were\nvisible. From a distance, it looked like\na pile of rotting human heads floating\non the sea. Such a terrifying scene\nfilled Muing and the others with\ndespair. They had no choice but to\ndespair. Dozens of terrifying sea\nmonsters the size of mountains and tens\nof thousands of immortal sea monsters.\nEven on land, they would not be a match\nfor such a lineup, let alone in the sea.\nAt this moment, there was truly no way\nout, not even to heaven or earth.\ndrastically. She quickly took out four\nbottles of light blue potion from her\nbosom and threw them at the crowd. This\nis a fish swimming potion. After taking\nit, you can move underwater like a fish\nfor an hour. Drink it quickly or the\nboat is definitely doomed. As soon as\nshe finished speaking, several thick\ntentacles descended from the sky and\nslammed down on the crowd. Everyone\npresent was an extraordinary being, so\ntheir reactions were naturally\nincredibly swift, and they scattered in\nall directions to avoid danger. However,\njust as Muing had predicted, the ship\nwas beyond saving. Under the sea\nmonster's attack, the small boat\ninstantly shattered into countless\npieces of wood, which scattered across\nthe sea, and everyone fell into the\nwater. Without the slightest hesitation,\nthey drank the fish swimming potion in\ntheir hands. Soon they felt a strange\nsensation in their bodies as if their\nskin had become as smooth as a fishes\nand they felt more at ease with the\nseaater. Being in the ocean at this\nmoment is like being in the air\nbreathing and speaking are not affected.\nThe resistance of the seaater was no\nlonger an obstacle at this moment.\nHowever, the fish swimming potion only\nlasted for an hour. The moment they fell\ninto the water, a group of immortal sea\nmonsters swam up from the seabed beneath\ntheir feet. Looking at the terrifying\nnumber of enemies, Su Mu smiled\nmysteriously. It's time for you to show\nyour skills, eternal heavenly venerable,\nhe turned to the panicked crowd. Such a\nlarge number of sirens acting in unison\nmust be controlled by the sea gods\nretinue. You all save yourselves. I'm\ngoing to find the sea gods retinue.\nAfter saying that, he plunged into the\ndeep sea without waiting for anyone's\nreply. As expected of Mr. Su, Lu Dong\npraised. Faced with such a large number\nof enemies, he actually chose to charge\ninto the frey alone, intending to\ncapture the leader first. A fierce\nfighting spirit ignited in his eyes, and\ndense crimson light spread across them.\nHis body swelled up strangely, and his\nskin turned crimson as he charged\ntowards the surrounding undead sea\nmonsters. Although Muing was a woman,\nshe displayed unparalleled composure.\nHer eyes flashed with a cold light, and\nher hands moved rhythmically. In the\nnext moment, countless seaweeds extended\nfrom the seawater, frantically\nstrangling and killing the enemies\naround them. Even Yong Doning, who was\nthe weakest, was fighting desperately.\nTheir courage and choosing to go to sea\ninstead of waiting to die in the sea\nkingdom is enough to prove their\nbravery. Now that they are in danger, it\nis only natural that they would risk\ntheir lives. In the dim seaater, the\nundead sea monsters around him seem to\nhave sensed Sumu's intentions and rushed\ntowards him madly. Sumu didn't indulge\nthem either. A massive amount of\nspiritual power surged into the silver\nring on his left hand. The energy\ndevouring ring. The continuous spiritual\npower was transformed into physical\nstrength, giving him terrifying speed.\nWith a sudden burst of strength, he\nmoved like a ghost from the seabed,\nconstantly dodging the attacks of the\nundead sea monster while reaching out to\ntouch its black fleshy tendrils. All the\nundead sea monsters he touched were\ninstantly annihilated by a flash of blue\nlight. At that moment, he seemed like a\ngod who could erase everything without\nany violent movements. With just a\nsimple touch, the surrounding sea\nmonsters were all reduced to ashes. The\nundying sea monster is not strong. Its\nindividual strength is even inferior to\nthat of a bronze level first tier\ntranscendent. It only relies on the\nadvantages of the seawater and its\nimmortality to wreak havoc. Once these\ntwo advantages disappear, they will be\nnothing more than cannon fodder. At this\nmoment, a huge sea monster resembling a\ntiger shark opened its blood red m and\nattacked Sumu from behind. The gaping m\nwas so large and its coverage area was\nso wide that Sumu, who was in the sea,\nhad no way to escape the attack range.\nHowever, Sumu did not run away and let\nthe other party swallow him into its\nmouth. After swallowing Sumu, the tiger\nshark sea monster swam to the other side\nwith unddeinished momentum. Deep in the\nocean, a humanoid creature covered in\ngreen scales is hiding in the shadows,\nobserving the situation. It is the sea\ngod servant who is controlling this\nattack. Was it really that easy to\nsolve? It had a vague feeling that\nsomething was wrong. With its sharp\neyes, it quickly noticed a human-shaped\nshadow in the spot where the tiger shark\nhad just swam. It was a human shadow.\nShadow? The sea gods retinue sensed\nsomething was wrong. And sure enough,\nthe humanoid shadow twitched, and Sumu\nemerged from the shadows unharmed.\n\"What?\" The sea god's servant exclaimed\nin shock. It can actually avoid physical\ndamage. Just as he was about to control\nthe tiger shark to turn around, he saw\nSumu shoot out and land on the tiger\nshark's back. His fair and slender hand,\nwithout any fluctuation of power, gently\nplaced on the black whiskers on its\nback. Whoosh! A flash of blue light and\nthe tiger shark vanished. Upon\nwitnessing this scene, the sea god's\nservant felt his heart sink to the\nbottom. His body silently sank down and\ndisappeared into a patch of coral. The\ngreen scales on his body instantly\nturned into the color of the coral upon\ncontact with it, as if they had\ncompletely merged into one, making them\nindistinguishable to the naked eye. The\ndivine power carried by Su Mu was too\nterrifying, making it dare not confront\nits power. After dealing with the tiger\nshark, Sumu looked around, trying to\nfind the sea god's followers behind the\nscenes. His gaze swept over the coral\nwithout lingering, and having found\nnothing, he had no choice but to swim\naway into the distance. In the coral\nreef, the sea god servant had a gloomy\nlook in his eyes as he pondered a\ncountermeasure. After the recent\nprobing, he had gained some\nunderstanding of Sumu's abilities. With\nits powerful physique, it can hide in\nthe shadows to avoid damage and can even\ndirectly wipe out the undead siren. It\ndidn't care much about the first two\nabilities. What it cared about most was\nthe divine power to erase the sea\nmonsters. This power was simply\nunreasonable. And even though it\npossessed the power of the sea god, it\ndared not try it lightly. After all, no\none can guarantee that the sea god will\ndefinitely be able to defeat the\nopponent's divine power. Damn it. We're\nboth chosen by God. So why can he use\ndivine power without limit? Is he still\na chosen one? It's practically divine\npossession. Use divine power to clear\nout even the minions like Sumu. It seems\nwe need to find another way. Chapter\n164. What are you expecting? The sea\ngods attendant eyes flickered as he\ncarefully analyzed Sumu's process of\nannihilating the sea monsters. The\nscenes flashing through his mind like a\nslideshow. Suddenly, he noticed\nsomething unusual. Sumu always touched\nthe black fleshy tendrils on the sea\nmonsters with his hands when he killed\nthem. There's a problem. A big problem.\nWhy did he have to touch the black\nfleshy tendrils to kill the sea monster?\nIs divine power such an inconvenient\nthing? If he could truly unleash divine\npower without limit, he could easily\ncontrol the blue light to wipe out all\nthe sea monsters and sea monsters around\nhim in an instant. Why bother with the\ntrouble of touching it? And why does it\nhave to be black fleshy tendrils? If the\ncondition for exercising divine power is\ncontact, can't we contact other places?\nAs a follower of the sea god, it\nnaturally knew what the black fleshy\nwhiskers were. They were a special organ\nthat existed between the soul and the\nbody, capable of reaching the soul of\nthe other party and then extracting it.\nSoul soul, I understand. A glint flashed\nin the eyes of the sea god servant. It\nfinally understood the condition for\nSumu to release his divine power. soul\ncontact. It seems the power wielded by\nthe deity behind Sumu is related to the\nsoul, which explains his obsession with\nthe black fleshy tendrils. If that's the\ncase, wouldn't it be better to simply\nkill him with overwhelming force without\ngiving him any opportunity to touch\nthem? Friend, what are you expecting? A\ngentle voice suddenly rang out behind\nthe sea god's retinue. What? The seagd\nservant was shocked and turned around in\ndisbelief, only to see Sumu, dressed in\nblack, standing behind him with a smile.\nHis black clothes blended perfectly into\nthe dark, deep sea. And if you didn't\nlook closely, it would look like a fair\nhuman face floating on the seabed.\nThat's impossible. The sea god servant\nwas terrified. It had clearly seen Sumu\nswimming away into the distance. So, how\ncould he suddenly appear behind it?\nHowever, he didn't have time to think\nbecause Sumu had already reached out his\nhand to it. The sea gods retinue tried\nto dodge, but due to the sneak attack,\nSumu ultimately gained the upper hand.\nThe fair, slender hand precisely grasped\nthe black, fleshy tendril on the back of\nthe sea god servant. The sea god s\ncompanion s eyes widened suddenly. At\nthis moment, it finally understood what\nthose immortal sea monsters felt like.\nThe black fleshy whiskers fell into\nSumu&lt;unk&gt;s hands and directly connected\nwith his soul. Then a brilliant\nboundless azure light suddenly rose up,\nspreading along the black fleshy\nwhiskers and covering the body of the\nsea god's retinue. At that moment, the\nimmortal creature felt death. Just as\nits body was about to be annihilated by\nthe blue light, driven by the instinct\nfor survival, countless mournful roars\nof souls suddenly resounded within its\nbody, and those souls continued to\nperish. Instead, a vast, mysterious, and\nirresistible force like the ocean\nemerged. This power seemed to come from\na higher dimension completely beyond the\nlimits of human imagination. Whoosh! A\nrich blue light emerged from the body of\nthe sea god's retinue, meeting the azure\nlight of the eternal heavenly venerable.\nOne blue and one cyan shot into the sky,\ntheir brilliance reflecting each other\nand coloring the entire sea in blue and\ncyan hues. The two beams clashed\nfiercely, locked in a stalemate.\nHowever, this stalemate only lasted for\na moment before the azure light began to\nrepel the blue light and spread towards\nthe sea god's retinue. The sea god's\nretinue was terrified, not because the\nsea god's power was failing, but because\nthe souls it had accumulated over the\nyears were being rapidly depleted,\ncausing the sea god's usable divine\npower to weaken rapidly. It was\nterrified. Taking advantage of the\nstalemate between the two divine powers,\nit suddenly stretched out its hand\ncovered with green scales and slashed\nfiercely at the black fleshy whiskers on\nits back. Ah! The sea god's followers\nscreamed in agony at the sight of their\nsouls being torn apart, but they managed\nto escape Sumu's clutches. Sumu\nnaturally couldn't let it go and\nimmediately chased after the sea god's\nretinue. Unfortunately, in the ocean, he\nhad no chance of catching up with the\nsea god's retinue, which was determined\nto escape. Within a few breaths, the sea\ngod's retinue vanished into the deep\nsea, disappearing without a trace. Sumu\nnarrowed his eyes, stopped in his\ntracks, and watched the other person's\ndisheveled retreating figure, a profound\nand unfathomable smile appearing on his\nlips. \"You can't escape.\" His lips\nparted slightly, and his soft words\ndrifted away with the seaater. He sensed\nhis soul and discovered that the blue\nlight that was supposed to cover his\nentire body in two days had faded\nsomewhat. Although the fading was not\nsignificant, it had successfully\nextended his life by one day. For this\nreason alone, the sea gods retinue must\ndie. Afterwards, Sumu went upstream and\nmet Muing and the others. Their battle\nwith the sea monster had already reached\na fever pitch. Muing and Lu Dong are\nindeed silverranked experts. Even though\ntheir own rank is not high, they cannot\nbe defeated by the sea monster in a\nshort time. Muing manipulated the\nseaweed in the sea, often killing a\nlarge number of sea monsters with a wave\nof her hand. Facing the huge sea monster\nthat attacked, she was equally fearless.\nShe took out a light green potion from\nher bosom and threw it directly into the\nsea monster's gaping m. Then her slender\nlittle hand moved silently. Countless\nthick trees, vines, and flowers bloomed\nfrom the sea monster's enormous body,\nbursting and piercing it alive.\nUnfortunately, no matter how\noverwhelming the battle was, it was of\nno use. The dead sea monsters turned\ninto seaater with a bang and soon came\nback to life from the seaater. Compared\nto the visual appeal of Muin's battles,\nLu Dolong's fighting style was simple\nand brutal. His entire body was crimson,\nand he resembled a human meat grinder.\nHe plunged head first into the sea\nmonster's body, frantically tearing at\nits flesh and bones with both hands, and\nsoon dismembered it. As for Yong Doning,\nlet's not even mention him. At this\nmoment, he was hiding listlessly inside\nthe mouth of a giant man-eating flower,\nclearly having been attacked by black\nfleshy tendrils and then protected by\nMuing. As time went on, the battle\nbetween the two became increasingly\ndifficult. Facing an unkillable enemy,\nthey were expending far too much energy.\nAt this moment, Sumu made his move.\nGiant sea monsters like a ghost. Because\nof their enormous size, the sea monsters\nwere clumsy and easily caught by Sumu.\nWith a flash of blue light, a\nbreathtaking scene unfolded. Wherever\nSumu passed, all the giant sea monsters\nin the sea vanished into thin air,\nleaving not even a trace. Those who\nwitnessed this scene almost forgot about\nthe battle, staring dumbfounded at the\nunbelievable sight before them. Anyone\nwho witnessed this scene would be\nshocked. A monster that they couldn't\nkill even if they fought to the death\nwas wiped out by Mr. Su with just a wave\nof his hand. The shock was beyond words.\nMuing and Lu Dong Leang even suspected\nthat Su Mu had been lying before. Mr.\nSue, you still say you're not a gold\nlevel expert. With the sea monsters\ndealt with, everyone finally had a\nchance to catch their breath and began\nto gather around Sumu. Mr. Su, have you\nfound the sea gods companions? Muing\nasked, breathing heavily. Her slightly\nswollen chest heaved and the seawater\nmade her body lines particularly\nprominent. Chapter 165 tsunami. It got\naway, Sumu said calmly. Upon hearing\nthis, Sumu's power was immediately\nelevated in the minds of the two. He\ncould even frighten away the legendary\ngods chosen one. Even a gold level\nexpert might not be able to do that.\nWhat do we do now? The effects of the\nfish swimming potion are almost over,\nand I've only made these few bottles.\nThere aren't any left. Sumu's eyes\nflickered and he was about to speak when\nhe heard a sound like a conch shell horn\ncoming from the depths of the sea. As\nthe sound spread, the sirens and sea\nmonsters seemed to receive some kind of\nsignal and they retreated continuously\nuntil they all disappeared into the deep\nsea. What's going on? Could it be that\nthe sea gods retinue is afraid? The\nlistless Yong Donging emerged from the\nmouth of the man-eating flower, looking\nat the retreating sea monster army with\na joyful expression. Sumu shook his\nhead. He's not afraid. He probably just\nthinks it's hard to kill us this way, so\nhe's planning to try a different\napproach. In what way? Yong Donging\nasked. Sumu did not answer because the\nhigh answered for him. Whoosh. On the\nboundless sea, the wind howled and the\nwaves surged. At the horizon, a white\nline suddenly rose. \"It's a tsunami,\"\nYong Doning exclaimed. He stared\nintently as the white line in the\ndistance rose higher and higher until it\nwas fully revealed, revealing a towering\nwave nearly a 100 meters high. The white\nwaves roared like ferocious beasts,\nsurging towards the crowd with\noverwhelming force. Before the waves\neven arrived, the various undercurrens\nin the sea were already surging wildly,\neven forming deep sea whirlpools, making\nit impossible for the people swept away\nto maintain their balance in the sea.\nMr. Sue, the effect of the fish potion\nis running out. What should we do now?\nShould we sink to the bottom of the sea\nand continue to search for the black\nmist? Or should we return to the sea\nkingdom for the time being and wait for\nme to refine a new batch of fish potion\nbefore setting sail again? Muing asked\nanxiously, looking at the towering waves\nthat were crashing in. Su&lt;unk&gt;s lips\ncurled slightly. Miss Mu, is the fish\npotion your own creation? Through his\nconnection with Nang Gong Monglay, he\nwas no longer a novice in the realm of\nextraordinary abilities. He was familiar\nwith all the various extraordinary\npotions available on the market, but he\nhad never heard of the swimming fish\npotion. Muing was taken aback, not\nunderstanding the meaning of the\nquestion, but still nodded and said,\n\"That's right. I specially made it after\nI came to the sea kingdom, just in\ncase.\" Sumu smiled slightly,\nunderstanding in his heart. Let's&lt;unk&gt;\ngo back. After saying that, he turned\nand swam towards the sea kingdom. The\nothers were a little confused. But given\nthe current crisis, they had no choice\nbut to follow Sumu closely and return\nthe way they came. Sumu chose to go back\nbecause he discovered something\ninteresting. The true purpose of the sea\ngods familiar seemed to be that they\ndidn't want them to find the black mist.\nThe giant wave, which appeared to be an\nattack, was actually forcing them to go\nback. All of them are extraordinary\nbeings and this kind of giant wave can\nonly be considered troublesome. It is\nsimply unrealistic to kill them with\nthis kind of power, especially since\nthey have already revealed their ability\nto breathe underwater in front of the\nsea god's followers. The most\ntroublesome thing about seawater is that\nhumans cannot breathe in it. Once the\nbreathing problem is solved, the threat\nof seawater will be greatly reduced.\nMoreover, the fish potion was created by\nMuing. So, how could the sea gods\nfollowers know that the potion's effects\nwere about to expire? Without knowing\nthe potion's duration, the sea gods\nfollowers should have clearly understood\nthat seawater alone could not kill\neveryone. And even if it could kill\neveryone, it could not kill Sumu, who\ncould escape into the shadow space? Even\nso, why did the sea gods minions still\nchoose to launch a tsunami attack? God\nwho could restrain his desire for souls\nand keep the entire sea kingdom under\nhis control would be so irrational.\nLogically, if someone capable of killing\nyou appears in your territory and their\ngoal is to leave, you can hide in the\ndeep sea, wait for them to leave and\nthen continue to lord it over you.\nInstead of launching useless attacks and\nconstantly provoking the opponent.\nTherefore, Sumu guessed that the true\npurpose of the sea god's followers was\nto use the tsunami to force them back to\nthe sea kingdom. Because when the\ntsunami surged and various whirlpools\nwere created on the seabed, they would\nhave no way to swim to the end of the\nsea to find the black mist. Combining\nthe previous doubts, he gradually\nguessed the truth about the sea kingdom.\nIf he was not mistaken, there would be\nan even grander performance to be staged\nin the sea kingdom. Things are getting\nmore and more interesting. The group\naccelerated, moving forward rapidly like\nfish swimming in the ocean. But no\nmatter how fast they went, they could\nnot outrun the whirlpools formed by the\nvarious undercurrents in the ocean. The\nwhirlpools of varying sizes were like\nblack holes frantically pulling at the\nsurrounding seawater. The people's\nbodies were constantly being pulled by\nvarious forces. If it weren't for the\nsuperhuman physique, the turbulence\nalone would have been enough to tear\ntheir bodies apart. To the sea, Sumu\ngave the order and rushed towards the\nsea with the others following closely\nbehind. When they reached the sea, they\ndidn't have to exert much effort. The\nsurging tsunami carried them forward.\nThe waves, powerful enough to smash\nhouses, caused them physical pain, but\nno fatal injuries. Of course, Sumu must\nbe excluded from this group. In terms of\nphysical strength alone, he is\nundoubtedly the weakest among them.\nMuing and Lu Dong Leong are both silver\nlevel, so their physical qualities are\nbeyond question. Although Yong Dongqing\nis weak, he can completely ignore the\ndamage caused by the waves thanks to his\niron will and unending recovery. Only\nSumu's physical attributes rely entirely\non the giant power fist enhancement, but\nthis is mainly reflected in his\nstrength, while his defense is much\nweaker. Fortunately, he also has the\nenergy devouring ring. A steady stream\nof spiritual energy flowed into the\nring, transforming into physical\nstrength, enough to keep him safe and\nsound during the tsunami. No one knew\nhow far they had been swept away by the\ngiant wave. When the wave disappeared, a\nblurry island appeared in their sight.\nAt this point, everyone was clearly in a\nmuch worse state. Their skin was pale\nfrom being soaked in the water, and they\nno longer sank to the bottom of the sea,\nbut instead chose to swim freely on the\nsurface of the sea because the effects\nof the fish medicine had long since worn\noff. Soon, everyone made it safely\nashore. Yang Donging collapsed on the\nbeach, panting heavily. The intense\nbattle and struggle in the sea had\nexhausted all his strength. Lu Dong was\nalso in poor condition. His bloody\nberserk was an explosive skill that\nconsumed a lot of energy. He had fought\nagainst sea monsters and swam for an\nunknown distance. Even an iron man\ncouldn't take it anymore. Muing\nmaintained a basic level of decorum. She\nsupported herself on her knees with her\nslender arms, her wet hair clinging to\nher delicate cheeks and glistening water\ndroplets dripping onto the beach. She\nreached into her pocket, pulled out a\nbottle of extraordinary potion to\nrestore her strength, and drank it all\nin one gulp. Her pale complexion quickly\nimproved. \"Mr. Su, do you need it?\"\nMuing asked, holding up the\nextraordinary potion in her hand. Sumu\nsmiled and shook his head. \"I&lt;unk&gt;ll\njust sleep for a while.\" After saying\nthat, to Muing astonishment, he casually\nleaned against the coconut tree and sat\ndown, stretching one leg out and bending\nthe other, then put his hands on his\nknees, lowered his head, and fell\nasleep. Because of the constant\nconversion of his spiritual energy, even\nthough his spiritual energy was vast, it\nwas starting to run out. In order to\ndeal with what might happen next, he\nchose to go to sleep first. Chapter 166.\nActing. A minute later, Sumu woke up\nfull of energy and apart from being\nsoaking wet, he was completely unharmed.\nMr. Sue, didn't you want to take a nap?\nIt's all right. You go to sleep. I've\ntaken the extraordinary potion and my\nstrength has recovered. I can keep an\neye on things here. Muing said with a\nhint of surprise. I'm awake. Sumu slowly\ngot up, took out his brown glasses from\nthe sheepkin storage bag, and put them\non. Muing suppressed the strange feeling\nin her heart and said, \"Seriously, Mr.\nSue, I thought about it carefully while\nyou were resting. I think the most\nurgent thing is to go to the palace and\nmeet up with the other nightmare\napostles. We need more manpower. This\nvoyage has proven that the sea gods\nfollowers are not invincible. One of the\nreasons they are afraid is that the sea\nmonsters are simply unkillable. Since\nyou, Mr. Sue, can kill the sea monster,\nthen with your call, surely more people\nwill be willing to go to sea together.\nThat's right. Lu Dolong's eyes lit up.\nEven if those cowards still don't dare\nto go into the black mist, they will\ndefinitely be willing to fight the sea\nmonsters with us. The siren is a common\nenemy of everyone. If they stay, they\nwill still face more and more siren. to\nprotect themselves. They will definitely\njoin us. A good suggestion, Sumu nodded,\nseemingly agreeing with everyone's\nsuggestion, but a mysterious look\nappeared in his eyes behind his brown\nglasses. Afterwards, the group returned\nto the simple palace of the Sea Kingdom.\n\"You've actually come back.\" Finance\nMinister Pangyang&lt;unk&gt;s first reaction\nupon seeing everyone was surprised. Then\nhe sneered slightly. \"What? You\nencountered setbacks at sea, so you're\nplanning to give up? I told you long ago\nthat you should just stay in the sea\nkingdom, but you young people just won't\nturn back until you hit a brick wall.\nYong Donging immediately retorted\nangrily. Who said we were planning to\ngive up? Lu Dong, who was standing to\nthe side, also said angrily, \"Do you\nthink we are all cowards like you? Let\nme tell you the truth. If it weren't for\nthe sea god's companion running away\nquickly, it would have been killed by\nMr. Su long ago.\" Ping Yong was taken\naback and asked doubtfully, \"Kill the\nsea god's followers? Are you kidding me?\nThe sea gods followers are immortal,\njust like the sea monsters. I'm too lazy\nto talk to you. Where's Hujia? Call him\nout now and summon all the other\nnightmare apostles as well. Mr. Su is\nabout to make a big move. You don't\nbelieve me, but don't you believe Mr.\nSu, who has returned from the black\nmist?\" Pingyang&lt;unk&gt;s eyes flickered as\nhe glanced at Su Mu, who stood to the\nside with an elegant expression. In the\nend, he said nothing and went directly\nto find Hujia. Before long, the\nking&lt;unk&gt;s banquet hall was filled with\nmore than 20 people, including not only\nthe nightmare apostles who had entered,\nbut also the nightmare apostles who had\nentered earlier and stayed in the sea\nkingdom to serve. King Hughes arrived\nlate after everyone had gathered. Mr.\nSu, it's wonderful that you're all\nalive. I thought this might be the last\ntime I'd see you. Hujia looked at Su Mu\nand the others who were safe and sound\nwith great emotion. Lu Dong&lt;unk&gt;s face\nturned cold. How dare you talk like\nthat. Spit it out, you jinx. Despite\nbeing publicly criticized as the king,\nHu Jia was not angry. Instead, he smiled\nand apologized. Sorry. Sorry. I'm not\ngood at speaking. I was just excited to\nsee everyone return. By the way, Mr.\nSue, I just heard from Pangong that you\nalmost killed the Sea God's followers.\nIs that true, Mr. Sue, please don't\nmisunderstand. I didn't mean to question\nyou. It's just that this matter is very\nimportant and I must confirm it. Sumu\nlooked at the excited Hu Jia and said\nwith a half smile, it's&lt;unk&gt; true. I\nhave mastered a law called the eye of\nannihilation which can annihilate\nenemies at the atomic level. Those sea\nmonsters, including the sea gods\nfollowers, are only relatively immortal.\nOnce they are wiped out at the atomic\nlevel, they will die just like before.\nOthers can prove this. Mr. Sue is right.\nI saw him kill countless sea monsters\nand more than a dozen mountain-sized sea\nmonsters. In the end, he even defeated\nthe sea gods minions. It's just a pity\nthat they escaped. Lu Dong Leyong spoke\nwith pride, as if he was very proud to\nhave participated in the battle. Muing\nand Yong Donging both gave affirmative\nanswers. Such shocking news exploded in\neveryone's hearts like a bomb.\nEveryone's first reaction was disbelief,\nas if they had heard some news that\ndefied common sense. For so many years,\nthe immortal sea monsters have never\nbeen truly killed. Yet now, someone has\nmanaged to kill them and even defeat the\nsea gods minions. This news is truly\nunbelievable. In the hall, the old and\nnew nightmare apostles discussed amongst\nthemselves, some with doubt, some with\necstasy, their expressions varied. Mr.\nSue, if what you say is true, then the\nfate of the entire sea kingdom may be\nrewritten because of you. Hujia's face\nlit up with ecstasy. What do you mean by\nif? Lu Dong Leong glared at him. We saw\nall of this with our own eyes. Are you\nsaying we're all lying? Hu Jia\napologized repeatedly. No, that's not\nwhat I meant. I just find it hard to\naccept for a moment that's an immortal\nsea monster. You newcomers may not know\nmuch about it, but we old folks have\nfought countless times against the\nimmortal sea monsters over the years. We\ndon't know how many of us have died, but\nnot a single immortal sea monster has\never died. All right. All right. I'm too\nlazy to listen to your nonsense. Lu Dong\nLeong stepped forward, his tiger-like\neyes sweeping over everyone. Let me tell\nyou, Mr. Su came back this time to\nrecruit soldiers and horses. We need\nmore manpower to surround the sea god's\nfollowers. As long as we don't let that\nbastard escape, Mr. Su can kill him.\nEveryone, Muing added, I know you are\nunwilling to go to the black mist with\nus. After all, the black mist is\ndangerous, and we will not force you.\nHowever, when it comes to dealing with\nthe sea god's followers, everyone's\ninterests are aligned. If you want to\nlive peacefully in the sea kingdom, then\nthe sea gods retinue must die.\nOtherwise, with the increasing number of\nsea monsters, you simply won't have\nenough souls to fill the void. The pros\nand cons were so simple and clear that\neveryone present understood them\nperfectly well, even without the two of\nthem explaining them. However, no one\nstepped forward to respond yet, because\ndeep down they still didn't quite\nbelieve it. That the immortal siren\ncannot be killed is deeply ingrained in\npeople's minds and it is absolutely\nunbelievable unless one sees it with\ntheir own eyes. Old who don't you have a\nfew immortal sea monsters locked up in\nyour dungeon? Why don't you release them\nso Mr. Su can show them off? Pyong\nsuddenly said who Jia suddenly realized.\nRight, right. I captured a few sirens\nand locked them in the dungeon to study\nthe secrets of their immortality.\nSomeone bring one of them up here. Yes,\nyour majesty. Two soldiers in silver\narmor immediately went to the dungeon\nand soon after a fully enclosed iron box\ntaller than a person was carried up.\nChapter 167 the wine is poisoned. At\nHujia's signal, a soldier took out a key\nand unlocked the iron box. He then\nquickly stepped back, fearing that the\nundying sea monster might suddenly rush\nout from inside. Perhaps sensing the\npresence of living beings, the\npreviously quiet iron box suddenly\nemitted a violent crashing sound. Bang!\nThe door was smashed open. Undead sea\nmonster, its body rotting and revealing\nits white bones with several writhing\nblack whiskers, emerged from it. The\nstench of decay mixed with a hint of the\nsea, permeated the entire venue, causing\nmany people present to frown in disgust.\nHowever, no one showed any fear.\nEveryone present was an extraordinary\nbeing, and naturally, they would not be\nafraid of a sea monster that was not\nmuch stronger than an ordinary person.\nAt this moment, Sumu strolled forward\nleisurely, and the sea monster roared\nand launched an attack directly on Sumu,\nwho was closest to it. Everyone watched\nSumu's movements closely, wanting to see\nif he could actually kill the sea\nmonster. Just as the siren rushed in\nfront of Sumu, he calmly extended a\nfinger and gently touched the black\nfleshy whiskers that were attacking him.\nWhoosh! A flash of blue light and the\nsea monster vanished into thin air.\nEveryone was startled and didn't even\nsee what had happened. They quickly\nlooked down at the ground and saw that\nthere was no seaater where the sea\nmonster had died. The immortal siren is\ndead. It's really dead. Pangyong rubbed\nhis eyes hard and looked closely. He\nfound that there was really no seaater.\nHe said in disbelief, \"This is\nimpossible. We tried all sorts of\nmethods before, but we just couldn't\nkill the sea monster. Now, Mr. Sue\nkilled the sea monster so easily with\njust a flick of his finger. Quickly,\nbring all the sirens from the dungeon\nup, you son of a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] A bloodthirsty\nglint appeared in Lu Dong&lt;unk&gt;s eyes as\nhe grabbed Pangyang&lt;unk&gt;s sleeve and\nsaid fiercely, \"What do you take Mr. Su\nfor?\" \"Hey, Mr. Lu, don't ruin\neveryone's harmony.\" Sumu said with a\nsmile, trying to stop him. Lu Dong Leong\nsnorted coldly at Pang Yang and released\nhis grip. Ping Yong realized his words\nwere inappropriate and quickly\napologized to Su Mu. Mr. Su, please\ndon't misunderstand. I didn't mean\nanything by it. I just Sumu waved his\nhand and said gently, \"I understand Mr.\nPangs concerns. After all, it is indeed\nhard for people to believe.\" Pingyong\nnodded repeatedly, his face full of a\nsmile. \"Mr. Su, I'm glad you understand.\nSo, I have a better suggestion, Mr.\nPang. Why don't you experience it for\nyourself?\" Sumu smiled and extended his\nhand to Pangyang. Ping Yang&lt;unk&gt;s\ninstant and he retreated frantically in\nfear. No, no, no. I was wrong, Mr. Su. I\nshouldn't have questioned you. I believe\nyou. I believe you. What a joke. That\nfinger strike could kill even a siren.\nHe didn't want to suffer the same fate\nas the siren. Sumu smiled slightly, his\ngentle gaze sweeping over everyone's\nfaces. If any of you still do not\nbelieve it, you are welcome to come\nforward and try it. The crowd's\nexpressions changed slightly, and no one\ndared to utter a sound. They had\nrealized that this unfathomable Mr. Su,\nwho appeared polite and easy to get\nalong with, was actually far more\ndangerous than Lu Dong Leong, who was\nquick to resort to violence at the\nslightest provocation, like a brightly\ncolored venomous snake hidden in a\nprimeval jungle. Huh? Huia laughed\nheartily and began to smooth things\nover. Ladies and gentlemen, today is a\nday of great joy. The siren crisis that\nhas been threatening the sea kingdom has\nfinally seen a glimmer of hope for a\nsolution with the appearance of Mr. Sue.\nI wholeheartedly agree with the\nsuggestions made by Mr. Louu and Miss\nMoot just now. Even if we are unwilling\nto venture into the black mist, killing\nthe sea gods retinue and the sea\nmonsters is a beneficial thing for\neveryone and even the entire sea\nkingdom. I believe you all think so too.\nI have already arranged a sumptuous\ndinner. Please come over so we can\ndiscuss our specific strategies over\ndinner. With the kind-hearted Hu Jia\nappearing, the crowd naturally had no\nreason to refuse. Moreover, they also\nwanted to use Su Mu&lt;unk&gt;s power to solve\nthe problem of the sea god's followers.\nSo, they gladly accepted the invitation.\nAt the banquet, Huia raised his glass\nand said, \"I propose that we all toast\nMr. Sue. If it weren't for Mr. Su\nappearance, the Sea Kingdom would not\nhave seen the light of day, and it would\nprobably have been completely destroyed\nbefore long.\" Respectfully, Mr. Sue. Mr.\nSu is truly the savior of the sea\nkingdom. It's human nature to curry\nfavor with the powerful, so the crowd\nnaturally didn't let it go. They quickly\ntoasted Su Mu and Pang Yang, who had\noffended him earlier, even chugged the\nbottle to express his apology. The\nguests and hosts enjoyed themselves\nimmensely. Only Muing and a few others\nlooked indifferent. Looking at the\nsmiling faces of everyone at the\nbanquet, Muing felt an overwhelming\nsense of disgust. She wished she could\nimmediately discuss countermeasures,\ndivide tasks, and head out to sea\ninstead of wasting time here celebrating\nprematurely. These people living in the\nsea country have long lost their\nfighting spirit. They are all good for\nnothings. She picked up her wine glass\nin frustration, took a small sip, and\nher expression changed slightly after\nthat one sip. The wine is poisoned. She\nfeigned composure and glanced at Sumu,\nwho was being toasted by everyone. As\nshe watched Sumu drink one cup after\nanother, she became increasingly\nanxious. Just as I was about to speak up\nto warn them, I noticed something\ntouching my leg under the table. She\nlooked down and was startled because\nwhat was touching her leg was not a\nperson at all, but a large shadowy hand.\nThe large shadowy hand released Muing s\nleg and instantly melted, turning into a\npuddle of shadow on the ground. The\nshadow writhed and traced several\nshadowy characters on the ground before\nrapidly receding like ripples in water,\neventually returning to Sumu's shadow.\nMuin's pupils suddenly contracted, as if\nshe understood something. She continued\neating the seafood on the table as if\nnothing had happened, glancing at Sumu\nout of the corner of her eye. Sumu\ndidn't look at her, seemingly completely\nabsorbed in the banquet. While drinking,\nthe group discussed their strategy.\nFinally, with Hujia's approval, they\ndecided to implement the plan to lure\nthe enemy. Under the guise of a\nsacrifice, they would try to trick the\nsea god's retinue into coming. In his\nwords, he was the only one who could\ncontact the sea god's retinue, and he\nwas the one who handed over the\nsacrifices to them each time. With him\nin charge, there's a high chance he can\ndeceive the sea god's retinue. If he\ncan, all the better. If he can't, it's\nall right. He can just kill a group of\nsea monsters first. Then launch a\nproactive attack and annihilate them\nstep by step. After a hearty meal,\neveryone returned to their rooms to rest\nand recharge for the big battle. The\nnext day night, Sumu stood alone by the\nwindow, admiring the beautiful sight of\nthe moon rising over the sea. The\nsilvery moonlight spilled onto the sea,\ncreating a shimmering silver expanse.\nThump, thump, thump. Mr. Sue, are you\nresting? Hujia's respectful voice rang\nout from outside the door. Sumu's eyes\nflickered slightly and a mysterious\nsmile appeared on his lips. No, please\ncome in, Mr. Who. Squeak. The wooden\ndoor was pushed open, revealing Hu Jia's\nfigure. He stood in the doorway, the\nmoonlight shining on him and casting a\nlong dark shadow on the floor of the\nroom. Mr. Sue, a worried look appeared\non Huia's face. I have thought carefully\nabout the countermeasures we discussed\nbefore, and I feel that there are still\nsome areas that can be improved. So, I\ncame here specifically to discuss it\nwith you. Please forgive me if there is\nanything inappropriate. His brown tinted\nglasses gleamed with the silvery light\nof the moon, making it impossible to\ntell what Su Mu was thinking. His gentle\nvoice rang out in the darkness. How\ncould it be inappropriate? I've been\nwaiting for you for a long time. Chapter\n168. Hu Jia's true identity. Hu Jia was\ntaken aback. The fainted worry on his\nface vanished completely and the\nexpression on his face hidden in the\nshadows became inscrutable. Did Mr. Sue\nknow I was coming. Sumu pushed up his\nbrown glasses, smiled slightly, and\nstepped out of the shadows, leaning on\nhis snake patterned wooden cane. The\ncool moonlight cast from the window\nilluminated his tall and slender figure\nlike ripples on water. Of course, I\nknew, but I didn't expect you to arrive\nso late. I've been waiting for quite a\nwhile. But good things come to those who\nwait. So, is everything ready? Mr. Su,\nwhat are you saying? I don't quite\nunderstand. Hujian narrowed his eyes and\nhis tone became low. Put away your\nclumsy acting, Mr. Who. Or rather, I\nshould call you a member of the Poseidon\nfamily. Hujia's pupils suddenly\ncontracted and the hypocrisy on his face\nvanished completely, replaced by endless\ncoldness. When did you discover it? The\nfirst time I saw you. Hu Jia sneered.\nThat's impossible. My disguise is\nflawless. Sumu shook his head slightly\nin disappointment. The more absolute a\nperson's knowledge is, the less it\nproves their audition. On the contrary,\nit only proves their ignorance. What you\ncall flawless is merely your own\nperception of flawlessness. To me, it's\nriddled with holes. No matter how\nconvincingly you disguise yourself, you\ncan't hide the fact that you have no\nsoul. Hujia's face was ashen. How did\nyou know I have no soul? My physical\nbody can clearly block mental probes.\ndisappointed, and he sighed. Do you know\nwhat it means to protest too much? Hu\nJia was taken aback and instantly\nunderstood the meaning behind Sumu's\nwords. The so-called no silver buried\nhere meant that someone buried 300 tales\nof silver in the ground and then fearing\nthat others would steal it deliberately\nput up a sign on the ground that read no\nsilver buried here to tell others that\nthere was no money there. His expression\nturned slightly grim. His physical body\ncould block spiritual probes but others\ncould not. Wasn't this telling others\nthat there was something wrong with his\nsoul? he asked somewhat defiantly.\nPerhaps I possess some kind of magical\nartifact that blocks mental detection.\nWhat makes you so certain because you're\nnot good enough? Hu Jia was stunned, not\nunderstanding the meaning of those\nwords. I learned from your herum that\nyou haven't favored them for many years\nand even allowed them to have affairs\nwith soldiers and ministers. None of\nyour children are your own. Furthermore,\nyou rarely eat at banquetss. I asked the\nmaid who serves you and she said that\nshe brings the food to your room\neveryday and no one has ever seen you\neat heartily except when entertaining\nguests. You usually eat in your room.\nCleaning toilets should be the most\ndreaded task for all the maids. But they\nwould v to clean the king's toilets\nbecause they didn't need to clean them\nat all. As a king yet living like a\nmonk, abstaining from women, alcohol,\nand meat, and largely delegating power,\nwillingly becoming a puppet. Do you\nthink that's realistic? who Jia remained\nsilent. He did not refute again. If you\nhad no strength, it would be normal for\nyou to be a puppet. But as a silver\nlevel expert and the only one who can\ncommunicate with the sea gods followers,\nyou are by no means without strength.\nThe only reason for this is that you are\nnot human at all, but a monster like the\nundying sea siren. You have no soul.\nYour body is just a shell. Naturally,\nyou won't have any human-like feelings.\nYou won't need to eat or excrete and you\nwon't be able to reproduce with a woman.\nEnough. Pujia roared, his cold eyes\nfilled with fury that had been reopened.\nSumu, do you think you're the only smart\nperson in the world? You think you've\nseen through everything, but little do\nyou know, you've already fallen into my\ntrap. His burly figure slowly approached\nSumu, his eyes filled with icy killing\nintent. Why do you think I didn't deal\nwith you at sea, but instead forced you\nback to the sea kingdom? You can indeed\nkill sea monsters, but that power has\nits limitations, right? Fujia revealed a\nsmug smirk. Only soul contact can\ntrigger that divine power. You are the\nnemesis of sea monsters, but\nunfortunately not the nemesis of humans.\nYou can't be killed in the sea, but you\ncan on land. You want to fight me on\nland? Sumu pushed up his brown glasses,\nthe moonlight shining on the lenses,\nmaking them gleam silver. You couldn't\neven do it in the sea. Are you sure you\ncan now? Huh? Hu Jia sneered. Sumu, your\nstrength is indeed not weak, but how\nmuch of it can you use now? Do you\nreally think I'm just bored and want to\nlisten to your reasoning? You're wrong.\nI'm stalling for time. Judging by the\ntime, the medication should be taking\neffect soon. Sigh. A long sigh echoed in\nthe room. Sumu looked at Hu Jia whose\nface was contorted with rage with a\ndisappointed expression. He sighed and\nsaid, \"Mr. Who do you know that I've\nbeen looking forward to this for a long\ntime and have been waiting for a long\ntime hoping that you can put on a\nwonderful performance for this? I have\nbeen doing my best to cooperate with\nyou. But how have you repaid me? Can you\nunderstand that feeling? The enemy you\nplaced so much hope in only to find out\nin the end that they were utterly\nuseless. Hu's expression changed\nslightly as he looked at Sumu who was\nstill standing in front of him and said\nin surprise, \"You weren't poisoned?\nImpossible. I saw you drink several cups\nof poisoned wine with my own eyes.\nThump, thump, thump. The sound of the\nsnakes skin cane hitting the ground,\nechoed continuously. Sumu walked step by\nstep towards Hujia. His steps were\nsteady and elegant, making him look like\na gentleman about to extend an\ninvitation to a ball. However, in Huia's\neyes, this scene was filled with an\nindescribable sense of oppression.\nSuddenly, Sumu stopped in front of Hu\nJia, his brown tinted glasses obscuring\nhis dark, unfathomable eyes. he said\ncalmly. I'll ask one last time. Is there\nany more surprises? Whoosh. Hu Jia\nretreated rapidly, escaping from the\nroom like an arrow. Pingong, bring your\nmen over here immediately and kill him,\nhe roared, and a series of hurried\nfootsteps immediately followed from not\nfar away. A dark mass of soldiers surged\nin from all directions along with a\ndozen ministers from the sea kingdom.\nThey arrived at Hujia's side almost\ninstantly, moving with incredible speed.\nThese dozen or so people were all\nnightmare apostles from the previous\nbatch who had come to the sea kingdom\nand had already joined the ranks. The\nweakest among them was at the second\nlevel of bronze and there were even a\nfew at the first level of silver. Such a\nterrifying display was all for the\npurpose of dealing with Sumu alone.\nLooking around, enemies were everywhere.\nHu Jia hiding in the crowd said solemnly\nto Pangyang and the others beside him,\n\"Sumu wasn't poisoned, so we have no\nchoice but to kill him ourselves.\"\nChapter 169, please. Mr. Sue, go to your\ndeath. Everyone's faces darkened. This\nwas clearly not good news for them. In\ntheir minds, Sumu was extremely\npowerful. Even if he wasn't a gold level\nexpert, he was at least a silver level\nexpert. If he were poisoned, they might\nbe able to defeat him easily. But now\nthey had no choice but to fight him head\non. Ping Yang took a deep breath and\nsaid in a deep voice, \"Mr. Su, don't\nblame us. We had no choice. If you have\nto blame someone, blame yourself for\nhaving the power to kill sea monsters.\nActually, long before you returned, the\nsea gods followers informed Hu Jia that\nwe should kill you. Otherwise, it would\nbreak the previous agreement and unleash\na tsunami to flood the entire sea\nkingdom. For the sake of all the\ncitizens of the Sea Kingdom, we beg Mr.\nSue to die.\" As Pangyong spoke, the\ncrowd grew increasingly solemn, like\nwarriors vowing to defend their country\nto the death. Ironically, the enemy they\nwere preparing to kill was not the\nsiren, but the one capable of killing\nthe siren. Mr. Sue, I know you must\nthink we are despicable, who Jia said\nwith a regretful look. You clearly\nwanted to help the heroes of the sea\nkingdom, but we turned against you with\nswords. But we really have no choice. We\nreally can't give up the sea kingdom\nwhere we've lived for so long and go to\nfight our lives in the black mist with\nyou. That's not going home. That's going\nto our deaths. Besides, even if you\nreally killed the sea gods followers, so\nwhat? As long as this ocean still\nexists, new sea god followers will\nappear sooner or later. When that\nhappens, you can just leave, but it will\nbe us, the sea kingdom, who will suffer.\nTherefore, for the sake of the sea\nkingdom, please make this sacrifice.\"\nHujia waved his hand, and the massive\narmy and a dozen or so extraordinary\nindividuals began to press forward step\nby step, constantly tightening the\nencirclement. It was thanks to Su\nMu&lt;unk&gt;s well-established persona as a\npowerful figure that everyone was so\ncautious. Otherwise, they would have\nrushed forward long ago. Slap, slap,\nslap. A burst of applause suddenly broke\nout in the somber atmosphere. It was\nSumu who was clapping. Finally, you've\npiqued my interest a little. Sumu smiled\nand praised. Since Mr. Who is putting on\nsuch a great performance, then I'll\nperform a magic trick for everyone as\nwell. Hujia's eyes narrowed and his mind\nraced. He guessed that Sumu was going to\nreveal the truth in public and expose\nhis identity as a member of the sea gods\nfamily. However, he quickly sneered\nbecause he was prepared and not afraid\nat all. People will only believe what\nthey think is the truth. The name of\nthis magic trick is the great\ndisappearance of a person. Hu Jia was\nstunned. A sudden appearance of a living\nperson? Could it be? Please look\ncarefully everyone. I am about to\ndisappear from your sight. Upon hearing\nthis, Hujia's lips curled into a barely\nperceptible sneer. His previous\nencounter at the bottom of the sea made\nhim realize that Sumu possessed some\nkind of illusion technique, which\nexplained why he had watched Sumu walk\naway, but then suddenly reappeared\nbehind him. He wouldn't fall for the\nsame trick twice. So, the moment he saw\nSumu, he activated the sirens ability to\nsense souls. He was absolutely certain\nthat the Sumu in front of him was the\nreal person because the clone created by\nillusions did not have a soul. Mr. Sue,\nstop pretending when you're about to\ndie. Attack. Kill him. With Hu Jia's\norder, the surrounding soldiers and a\ndozen or so superhumans led by Pangyong\nlaunched an attack simultaneously.\nAlmost instantly, several terrifying\nattacks struck Sumu, tearing his body to\npieces and turning him into a pile of\nsevered limbs and remains. Everyone was\nstunned. What happened? He was killed so\neasily. Even Hu Jia himself was stunned.\nHe guessed that apart from the strange\nblue light, Sumu's strength might not be\nas strong as he had imagined, but there\nwas no reason for him to be this weak.\nMake way, Hu Jia pushed through the\ncrowd and squeezed to the front. He\nstared intently at the tragically dead\nSumu, his eyes filled with an unyielding\nsense of confusion. He bent down and\npicked up Sumu&lt;unk&gt;s head. The elegant\nsmile on his fair face was still\nstriking in the darkness. But the next\nsecond, Huja's expression changed\ndrastically. He stared intently at Su\nMu&lt;unk&gt;s head, only to find that the\nhead had somehow transformed into a\nwoman's. This This is the Empress. Pang\nYang&lt;unk&gt;s expression changed\ndrastically as he incredulously snatched\nthe Empress&lt;unk&gt;s head from Huia's\nhands. No, no, no. Why is it the\nEmpress? He looked griefstricken, as if\nhis wife had died. Hujia's face darkened\ncompletely. He vaguely guessed the\ntruth. The Empress must have been unable\nto wait any longer and hid in Sumu's\nroom before Sumu returned. As a result,\nshe was controlled by Su Mu and turned\ninto a puppet. Search. Go search for me\nnow. Search the whole country or the\nwhole country to find Su Mu. Pingyong\nroared at his men, his eyes bloodshot.\nWait, he can't handle this alone. He\nmight need to go and meet up with Muing\nand the others. Let's&lt;unk&gt; go check on\nhim first, Hu Jia said grimly. He\nhurriedly led several extraordinary\nindividuals to Muing and the others room\nonly to find that there was no one in\nthe room at all. Damn it. Hu Jia roared\nin fury. He realized he had been\ntricked. Sumu had seen through his plan\nlong ago and arranged everything in\nadvance. The entire sea kingdom was\nmobilized. Countless people were\nawakened from their sleep and large\nnumbers of soldiers move through the\nstreets and alleys. The outsider Sumu\nhas angered the sea god by going to sea.\nThe sea god has issued a decree that if\nsu is not killed within 3 days, a\ntsunami will be unleashed to flood the\nentire sea kingdom. Countless soldiers\nshouted in the streets, mobilizing the\nentire nation to capture Sumu. These\npeople might dare to disobey the king's\norders, but they would never dare to\ndisobey the sea god. They grew up\nlistening to the legends of the sea god,\nand their fear of the sea god was\ningrained in their very souls. Inside a\nresidential house, Su Mu and the others\nwere gathered intact. Mr. Sue, no wonder\nyou said before that the king was a\nfollower of the sea god and asked me to\ndetoxify Yong Dongqing and the others in\nadvance. It turns out it was true, Hu J.\nEvery plan was exactly what you\nexpected, Muing said softly, listening\nto the commotion outside. At this\nmoment, Muing and the other two were\nfilled with shock. They found it hard to\nbelieve that Hu Jia was the so-called\nfollower of the sea god, the king of a\ncountry, and the protector in the eyes\nof the people who was actually the one\nwho persecuted them. Sumu smiled\nslightly. Don't you think the entire sea\nkingdom operates much like a farm? The\nfarm owner feeds and waters the\nlivestock, lets them reproduce, and then\nslaughters them in the end. Chapter 170.\nFear of power, not gratitude. The three\nwere taken aback. After Sumu's reminder,\nthey suddenly realized that the fact\nthat the king was a follower of the sea\ngod was not so unreasonable, but rather\nquite reasonable. \"Sure enough, there's\nnothing new under the sun,\" Muing said\nwith her mouth slightly open. \"It's just\nthat this time the livestock have been\nreplaced with people,\" \"Mr. Su. So,\nshould our next plan be to make it\npublic that the king is a follower of\nthe sea god? We must expose the truth.\"\nYong Doning gritted his teeth and said,\n\"This beast not only treats people like\nlivestock, but now he's using innocent\ncitizens to attack us. If we expose the\ntruth, the citizens under Hu Jia's\ncommand, as well as those superhumans,\nwill definitely rise up against us, and\nthen the situation will be reversed.\"\nSumu smiled without saying a word. Muing\nnoticed Su Mu&lt;unk&gt;s expression and\ncouldn't help but ask, \"Mr. Su, do you\nthink this method is inappropriate?\nWhat's wrong with that?\" Yong Doning\nlooked puzzled. I think this is the best\nway. If we don't reveal the truth, it's\nlike the four of us are going to be\nenemies with the entire sea kingdom. We\ncan't fight like that. Sumu shook his\nhead. You still don't understand human\nnature. Muing&lt;unk&gt;s heart skipped a\nbeat. Mr. Su, are you worried that the\npeople don't trust us? That's certainly\npossible. After all, Hu Jia is the king\nand we are just outsiders. If we openly\nsay that the king is a follower of the\nsea god, no one will believe us.\nHowever, we can carry out the\ndecapitation plan. I had already\ninquired about Hujia's abilities. After\nall, he had lived in the sea kingdom for\n10 years, so his abilities were no\nsecret. His silver law was sequence 32,\npaper cutting evil spirit, which\nspecifically manifested as the creation\nand control of paper dolls. I guess that\nthe reason Hu Jia could maintain his\nhuman appearance was because he put his\ntrue body into a paper doll. As long as\nwe can attack him, we can break through\nthe paper dolls disguise and expose his\ntrue form, then the people will\ndefinitely be on our side. Great. Lu\nDong became excited and started rubbing\nhis hands together excitedly. I've been\nannoyed with Hu Jia for a long time.\nGive me this task. After activating\nberserk mode, Muing, you can use the\nvines to throw me at Hu Jia. In my fully\nberserk state, I'm sure I can hurt Hu\nJia. At this moment, Yong Doning, whose\nIQ was below average, became unusually\nclever, proving that even a fool can\nhave a stroke of genius. Yong\nDoning&lt;unk&gt;s eyes lit up, and he\nexclaimed in delight. There's no need\nfor all that trouble. I have a way to\nsee through Hu Jia's true identity\nwithout taking any risks. What method?\nMuing looked at him suspiciously. Yong\nDonging smiled smugly. Sumu has an\nillusion ability. As long as he uses\nthis ability on Huia, he can make Hu Jia\nlook like a member of the sea god's\nretinue. After revealing this method, he\nbecame increasingly proud, feeling that\nhe was a genius who could come up with\nsuch a perfect plan. The inspiration for\nthis method mainly came from when Su Mu\nfaked the rotting on Tyangs body as\nBurns when he was making the statue of\ngods and demons. Muing and her companion\nwere both surprised and delighted. They\nhadn't expected Su Mu to be so versatile\nand possess such skills which gave them\neven more confidence. Unexpectedly, Sumu\nsighed at this moment. I told you, you\ndon't understand human nature. If you\nreally understood it, you would never\nhave come up with such a useless method.\nThe three were stunned, especially Yong\nDona, who had finally managed to show\nhis worth, who said impatiently, \"How\ncould it be useless? As long as we\nreveal the truth, we're guaranteed to\nwin. No matter how strong Hu Jia is, can\nhe withstand the siege of all the\nsuperhumans in the entire sea kingdom?\nThis isn't the sea, it's land. Sumu's\nexpression was inscrable. He said\ncalmly, \"Do you really think that Hu Jia\nwas able to gain the support of the\nentire sea kingdom because of his status\nas king? As long as it is revealed that\nhe is a member of the sea gods family,\nthose extraordinary individuals and even\nthe people will turn back to him.\"\nYou're wrong. The reason those\nextraordinary beings obeyed Hu Jia's\norders was actually because they were\nthe followers of the sea god. As long as\nthe sea gods followers say they'll\nunleash a tsunami to engulf the sea\nkingdom if they don't kill us, then\nwe're destined to stand against the\nentire sea kingdom. Whether Hu Jia says\nthis on behalf of the sea gods followers\nor whether he himself becomes a member\nof the sea gods followers and says it,\nthe effect is the same. How can these be\nthe same? Yang Donging said in\ndisbelief. The sea gods retinue are\nmonsters while the king is human. Once\neveryone knows they've been deceived by\nthe king, they certainly won't listen to\nhim. Muing standing to the side seemed\nto have figured it out and her face grew\neven more unpleasant. Mr. Su is right.\nWe were thinking too simply. This world\nis not black and white and not everyone\nis willing to stand on the side of\njustice. Mr. Yong, you can imagine what\nwould happen if according to your plan,\neveryone found out that Hu Jia was a\nmember of the Sea God's family. Will\npeople really rebel against Hu Jia? Why\ndidn't you resist? Yang Doning thought\nMuing was talking nonsense. Sigh. Muing\nsighed, her slightly childish face\nrevealing a maturity beyond her years.\nIf Jia said that he would launch a\ntsunami if anyone dared to make a move.\nMr. Yang, you have guts and no relatives\nhere, so you can fight to the death. But\nwhat about the others? The people here\nhave long been worn down and are used to\nthis kind of life. Hu Jia only needs to\nsay lightly. As long as you continue to\nlisten to me, everything will remain the\nsame. Do you think people will listen?\nIf you don't listen, you'll both perish.\nIf you listen, everything will remain\nthe same. You'll have food, drink, and\nwomen. If you were in that situation,\nwhat would you choose? Yong Dong&lt;unk&gt;s\nexcited expression instantly cooled, and\nhis face turned pale. Sumu said calmly.\nThe key to this matter is that compared\nto us outsiders, the people are more\nafraid of the long-established power of\nthe sea god's retinue. Even if the other\nparty may not have the ability to launch\na tsunami on land, as long as he says\nthose words, the people and superhumans\nwill definitely be terrified. Then,\ndriven by fear, they attacked us. Eh,\nYong Donging forced out a suppressed\nlaugh. So even if we're on the side of\nhumanity, on the side of justice, even\nif the truth is laid bare before\neveryone, they'll still choose to help\nthe monster. Damn it. He pounded the\nground hard, his heart filled with a\npentup anger that had nowhere to go. Why\nis this happening? Because the people of\nthis island nation only fear power and\ndo not cherish virtue. Sumu's calm words\nrevealed the coldest truth. Har, as\nexpected of Mr. Su, your evaluation is\nspoton. King Hu Jia&lt;unk&gt;s praise\nsuddenly came from outside the house.\nMuing and the others expressions changed\ndrastically and Lu Donglong who reacted\nthe fastest was the first to strike\ntowards the source of the sound. Bang!\nThe wall shattered with a crash and a\npaper figure was sent flying after\nfloating in the air for a few moments.\nThe force from Lu Dong Leong dissipated\nand it landed safely. The paper thin\nfigure's face was outlined with simple\ncrude features like the clumsy work of a\ndown on his luck painter. It had no\naesthetic appeal whatsoever, but rather\nexuded a sense of eeriness. If you look\nclosely, you'll find that the paper\nfigure's features bear a striking\nresemblance to Hu. The paper figure\nlooked at everyone with a strange smile.\nI didn't expect Mr. Sue to see through\nthe true nature of this place after only\n2 days on the island. As you all said,\nso what if my identity is revealed? The\nreason I hid my identity was simply out\nof compassion for the people, not\nwanting them to live in fear all the\ntime, which is not conducive to\nreproduction. What good is it if they\nknow the truth? The truth has never\nmattered. What matters is whoever\ninstills fear in them, they will obey.\nChapter 171, the battle of the crowd and\nYong Dongqing&lt;unk&gt;s instant defeat.\nThey're here. The paper figures suddenly\nroared, the loud voice piercing the\nnight sky and immediately attracting the\nattention of nearby soldiers and\ncivilians. The dark streets echoed with\na cacophony of footsteps as a massive\ncrowd surged forward like a tidal wave.\nMuing and the others were extremely\nanxious. Mr. Su, what do we do now? Sumu\nremained calm, stepped forward, and\nstood in front of the crowd. You go\nfirst, I'll cover the rear. At the same\ntime, a soft voice suddenly rang in\neveryone's ears. Wait for me at the\nbeach. Knowing that this was no time to\ndelay, the group nodded heavily, and\nthen the three of them split up and\nbroke through to the surrounding areas.\nMany people chased after the three, but\nmost remained where they were,\nsurrounding Sumu. They all knew very\nwell that Sumu was the backbone of the\nteam, and as long as Sumu was killed,\nthe remaining members would not be able\nto cause any trouble. The three, running\nfrantically, looked at Sumu Mu, who was\nalready surrounded. They were anxious,\nbut also a little moved. After all, not\neveryone would stay behind alone to\ncover the retreat for a companion they\nhad only known for a few days. However,\nthis feeling of being moved lasted only\na second before it ended. Because Sumu\ndied, Hujia's paper doll severed its\nhead in one blow. The head fell to the\nground, revealing a dark-skinned,\ndull-looking face, clearly belonging to\nan unknown native of the Sea Kingdom.\nUpon seeing this, Yang Daing, whose eyes\nwere already red with emotion, turned\neven redder. He was so angry that he\nwanted to curse. Is this what you call\ncovering the rear with Sumu's fall? All\nthe pressure suddenly fell on the three\nof them. Want to leave? Not so easy. A\nnightmare apostle rushed over. And for\nhis own safety, he went straight for the\nweakest one. Yong Doning. You should\npick the softest pimmen to squeeze. Yong\nDoning is only a second tier bronze\nlevel. So, who else should you go after?\nThe man leaped into the air, his figure\nstreaking across the night sky, hurtling\ntowards Yong Donging like a cannonball.\nFeeling the strong wind coming from\nbehind, Yong Doning&lt;unk&gt;s expression\nchanged drastically. He instinctively\nrolled away to avoid the attack. Covered\nin dust, he looked closely and his heart\ntightened. He saw that the spot where he\nhad just stood had been smashed into a\ndeep crater. A man in a denim jacket\nemerged from the pit with a sinister\ngrin, staring mockingly at Yong Doning.\nIt's you, Yong Doning said with a grim\nexpression. You were one of the\nnightmare apostles who entered the\nnightmare apostles in the same batch as\nMuing and the others. Why are you\nhelping Hu Jia? The cowboy sneered,\njudging from your tone. You seem to be\nblaming me. Ba, I've been annoyed with\nyou guys for a long time. You're the\nonly ones who have the courage to go to\nsea. And we're all cowards, aren't we?\nYes, I admit I'm a coward. But why did\nyou have to anger the sea god if you're\ngoing to go to sea? How are those of us\nwho decided to stay supposed to live? It\nwasn't us who angered them. It was all\nwho J lies. He's the one who's really\nangry, Yong Doning said urgently, but\nwas interrupted by the cowboy. Stop\ntalking nonsense. You have the guts to\ndo it, but not the guts to admit it. Go\nto hell. A burst of dazzling metallic\nlight suddenly erupted from the cows\nbody. The light was so intense that it\nalmost made him look like a metal man.\nYong Donging was horrified. the follower\nof power. He recognized it as the silver\nlaw. Follower of power. His superior\nlaw. A silver law that could only be\nadvanced to after collecting iron will,\nunending recovery, and mega fist. We\ncan't beat them. We can't beat them at\nall. Boom. A fist gleaming with metallic\nlight, carrying terrifying force, came\ncrashing down. Yang Donging felt the\npressure of the punch, gritted his\nteeth, and raised his hands to block in\nfront of him. But the next second, a\ndull metallic clang rang out, mixed with\nthe sound of bones breaking. Bang! Yang\nDonging&lt;unk&gt;s arms were instantly\nbroken, and even part of his chest\ncollapsed. He was sent flying backward\nand crashed into a row of houses. Oof!\nWeaklings! The cowboy sneered as he\nwalked towards the ruins of the houses.\n\"If it weren't for the king&lt;unk&gt;s order\nto keep you around to reproduce, I would\nhave killed you in one move.\" His hand,\ngleaming with a cold light, reached into\nthe ruins and dragged the heavily\ninjured Yong Donging out like a dead\ndog. Yong Dong&lt;unk&gt;s body was flashing\nwith a white light of endless recovery,\nand his injuries were constantly healing\nthemselves. The cowboy immediately threw\na series of punches, breaking all four\nof Yong Dona&lt;unk&gt;s limbs. \"Oh!\" Yong\nDoning screamed, but there was no fear\non his face. Instead, his eyes turned\nbloodshot as he bit down hard on the\ncowboy. Click! He had lost several teeth\nwhile the other person's skin only had a\nrow of faint white marks. The defense of\nthe power servant is too strong. As Yong\nDoning&lt;unk&gt;s superior law, it is simply\nimpossible for him to break it. Take a\nnap first, you weakling. Bang! The\ncowboy delivered a karate chop to the\nback of Yong Dong&lt;unk&gt;s neck, instantly\nturning Yong Donging&lt;unk&gt;s eyes white\nand causing him to lose consciousness\ncompletely. Battles broke out elsewhere\nas well. Lu Dong was surrounded by\nseveral superhumans who had arrived. He\nentered a state of complete berserk\nmode. His entire body turning crimson\nlike a redhaired demon crawling out of\nhell. And he frantically attacked all\nliving things around him. This is the\ndisadvantage of warriors. Being limited\nto physical attacks, they are easily\nsurrounded when encountering enemies\nstronger and more numerous than\nthemselves. In contrast, Muing had it\nmuch easier. She stretched out her\ndelicate white hand and slammed it onto\nthe ground. A vibrant green light\nemanated from her body, flowing down her\npalm into the ground. In the next\ninstant, countless vines and trees shot\ninto the sky, trapping the pursuers\nwithin. Some ordinary soldiers were even\npierced through the body by tree\nbranches on the spot, and their bodies\ncontinued to rise with the trees hanging\non the branches. As she continued to\nexert her strength, the trees continued\nto grow wildly, and in the blink of an\neye, a dense forest rose up, concealing\nher figure. Using the cover of the\nforest, she fled frantically. Whether it\nwas an illusion or not, Muing seemed to\nbe moving even faster in the forest.\nUnfortunately, while trees can stop\nordinary people, they cannot stop\nextraordinary individuals. A dark figure\nflashed out of the forest like a ghost.\nThe myithal dagger in its hand gleaming\nin the moonlight, following Muing almost\nlike a shadow. With a slash of his\ndagger, he immediately left it deep,\nbone revealing gash on Muing's back.\nMuch groaned, enduring the pain as she\nturned around and sprinkled a handful of\nblack powder. The man's gaze sharpened,\nnot knowing what the black powder was.\nHe dared not take it head-on and had no\nchoice but to temporarily avoid its\nattack. He wasn't in a hurry. Muching\nsilver law, nature's call, was ranked\nvery low, only somewhat effective\nagainst ordinary people, and completely\ninadequate against superhumans.\nMoreover, Muing had already been\ninjured, so her speed would definitely\nbe affected. Just as he was thinking\nthis, he saw Muing seemed to be unable\nto hold on any longer and stumble head\nfirst into the bushes. Chapter 172.\nActually, I had a solution. On the very\nfirst day, he walked toward the bushes\nwith a cold smile, his eyes flashing\nwith wicked thoughts. Muching, this\nlittle girl, was not in the same league\nas the women of the sea kingdom. Her\nfair and delicate skin and petite figure\nhad long been stirring his heartstrings.\nThere was no reason to do it before. But\nnow that Muing has been caught, the\nconsequence is that she will be reduced\nto a breeding tool. Since that's the\ncase, I might as well try it myself\nfirst. He cautiously parted the bushes\nwith his mythil dagger, wary of Muing\nsneak attack, but he was stunned when he\ndid because there was no sign of Muing\nin the bushes, only a patch of withered\nweeds. The weeds seemed to have been\ndrained of their life force, turning\nyellow and withered, crumbling at the\nslightest touch. His expression changed\ndrastically. Damn it. This bastard's law\nis definitely not nature's call. It can\nactually absorb the life force of plants\nand trees. What kind of law is this? In\nthe woods, not far away, Muin crawled\nforward cautiously, and the deep bone\nrevealing blood stain on her back had\nlong since healed, revealing a glimpse\nof Snow White skin through the torn\nfabric. The most amazing thing is that\nshe seemed to have become invisible.\nEven though she was in the enemy's line\nof sight, the enemy could not see her.\nMuching walked step by step toward the\nsea. She believed that the mysterious\nand powerful Mr. Su must have his own\nplans, and what she needed to do was to\nsurvive as long as possible and meet up\nwith Mr. Su at the seaside. Of the four\nmembers of Su Mu&lt;unk&gt;s group, only Muing\nmanaged to escape using her unique\nabilities. Yong Dongqing was captured\nimmediately, while Lu Dong held out for\na long time before finally being\ncaptured after exhausting himself in the\nface of the group's attack. As for Sumu,\nhe didn't appear at all from beginning\nto end. Sometimes the difference between\npeople is huge, even greater than that\nbetween people and dogs. While everyone\nelse was in grave danger, and even two\nof them were captured, Sumu, the leader,\nwas leisurely sitting on a rock by the\nsea, admiring the reflection of the\nbright moon in the water. No one knows\nwhen he arrived, just as no one knows\nwhat he was doing at the beach. Mr. Su,\na joyful voice came from the woods not\nfar away. and Mu Ching with her hair\ndisheveled and her chest heaving ran\nout. Sumu did not turn around, still\ncalmly admiring the sea view. I thought\nno one would reach the beach, but I\ndidn't expect Miss Mu to actually do it.\nIf I'm not mistaken, your silver law\nshould not be sequence three, nature's\ncall. Muing paused for a moment, not\ngiving a direct answer. Whether it is or\nnot is not important. Now is not the\ntime to discuss my loss since Mr. Su saw\nthrough Hu J's plan so early on and even\nhas the leisure to enjoy the sea view\nhere. He must have already come up with\na way to turn the tables, right? Su Mu\nturned around, the cool moonlight\nshining on his angular face as if it\nwere coated with a layer of silver\nlight. He smiled slightly. What\ncomeback? Muing was taken aback. Just as\nshe was about to speak, she heard Su\nMu&lt;unk&gt;s gentle voice continue. His\nvoice was like a spring breeze, gentle\nand soft, without a trace of sharpness\nor impatience, showing confidence and\ncomposure. The overall situation is in\nour hands. They are the ones who are\ntruly in dire straits. His voice seemed\nto possess a magical power that brought\npeace to people's hearts. And Muing, who\nwas originally tense and anxious, was\nslowly soothed. We're being hunted down\nby the entire sea kingdom, and two of\nour teammates have even been captured.\nIsn't this a desperate situation? Muing,\nnow calmer, even had the mood to joke.\nSumu pushed up his brown tinted glasses\nand said with a faint smile, \"Actually,\non the first day I arrived in the sea\nkingdom, I already had a way to break\nthe sea god&lt;unk&gt;s curse and leave this\nplace.\" Muing&lt;unk&gt;s beautiful eyes,\n\"Then why haven't you taken action yet,\nMr. Su?\" Sumu gazed at the sea and said\nsoftly, \"Because that would be too\nboring. I don't like things that are too\neasy. So, I try my best to cooperate\nwith who Jian is acting, hoping he can\ngive me more surprises. As it turned\nout, he really was a good for nothing.\nWhile he brought a little surprise, it\nwasn't much, and this far should\nprobably come to an end now. He slowly\nstood up, gazing at the boundless sea in\nthe darkness, no one knew what he was\nthinking. Muing watched his back as the\nsea breeze blew, making her feel a\nlittle cold, and she unconsciously\ntightened her clothes. She couldn't\nunderstand why there were people like\nthis in the world. Was it just because\nshe found it boring? Mr. Sue, is it\npossible that your strength is already\nenough to contend with the entire sea\nkingdom, including those 20 odd\nextraordinary individuals? Muing asked\nbecause she couldn't think of any other\npossibility. The most likely explanation\nis that Sumu is an unparalleled expert,\nconfident enough to take on an entire\nnation single-handedly, which is why he\nwatched Huja perform. Sumu shook his\nhead. No. Muing was taken aback. Then\nyou Miss Mukin concocted extraordinary\npotions. Is that right? Sumu suddenly\nasked. Muing's eyes flickered and she\nnodded. I once worked for a period of\ntime at the largest pharmaceutical\ncompany in the real world, Federal\nPharmaceuticals. So, I learned how to\nrefine extraordinary potions. Most of\nthe extraordinary drugs that Nangong\nMuni had previously acquired were\npurchased from the Federal\nPharmaceutical Company. Its business\ncovered the seven empires and any\nextraordinary person who wanted to buy\nextraordinary drugs would definitely\nchoose the Federal Pharmaceutical\nCompany first. Legend has it that this\ncompany is already incredibly wealthy\nand if they wanted to, they could even\nestablish the eighth empire of\nhumankind. Do you have any extraordinary\npotions like Mighty Fist that can\npermanently enhance physical attributes?\nYes. Muching rummaged through her bosom\nand pulled out a bottle of pale silver\npotion. It looked like silver glitter\nsprinkled on water. Sparkling and very\npretty. I have the most common\nsupernatural potion on the market called\nIron Heart. I made it to make money, but\nbefore I could find a suitable buyer, I\nentered the nightmare world. Sumu smiled\nslightly. That would be wonderful. She\nwalked over to Sumu, handed him the\nextraordinary potion, and asked with a\npuzzled look, \"Mr. Su, could this potion\nbe helpful to your plan?\" No wonder she\nwas puzzled because she simply couldn't\nfathom how Sumu would use a bottle of\nbronze potion to deal with the entire\nsea kingdom. Sumu took the medicine and\nsmiled. No, Muing. For some reason, she\nsuddenly felt an urge to hit someone.\nWhy did she ask me to get the medicine\nif she wasn't going to help you? But\nit's very helpful to me. Sumu opened the\nlid of the potion and then drank it all\nin one gulp, much to Muing&lt;unk&gt;s\nastonishment. Chapter 173. iron will and\nendless demonic sound. \"Mr. Suyu,\" she\nstared in disbelief. Her cherry pink\nlips slightly parted. She couldn't\nunderstand why Sumu, who was suspected\nto be a gold level expert, would swallow\na bottle of bronze level potion at this\nmoment. After drinking the potion, Sumu\nslowly closed his eyes. In his vision, a\nvast net of stars covering the heavens\nand the earth appeared. Stars of\ndifferent colors and emanating different\nauras shone brightly in this net.\nSuddenly, he felt his consciousness\nfloat above the net and land on a\nsteel-like star. Buzz. The steel stars\ntrembled, and a beam of light descended\nfrom the sky, landing on Sumu and\nconnecting with his soul. In an instant,\na metallic sheen, just like Yong\nDonings, began to appear on his skin.\nHis physical abilities surged at this\nmoment. Unlike the giant power fist,\nthis increase focused more on defense.\nHis skin became as hard as steel, and so\ndid his bones. Suddenly, Sumu felt a\nsense of relief. The enormous mental\nenergy no longer caused any burden on\nhis body. If his body was a wooden\nbucket filled with water before, it was\nnow an iron bucket with a larger\ncapacity than before. The more intense\nthe metallic color on the body became,\nthe more pronounced this sensation\nbecame. Just as the metallic color\nreached its peak, the immaculate heart,\nwhich had already been digested,\nsuddenly emitted a shimmering white\nlight. White light surged into his limbs\nand bones, mingling with the metallic\ncolor. Sumu suddenly noticed that the\nmetallic color began to weaken as if a\nrough iron block had been forged in a\nraging fire hundreds of times with all\nimpurities removed, turning it into a\npiece of refined iron. He smiled\nsilently. The immaculate heart was the\nfirst bronze law he obtained, and it\ncould even be said to be the weakest law\nhe possessed. Its enhancements in all\naspects were minimal and it had no\noffensive capabilities whatsoever. It\nwas entirely a passive ability. But\nafter these experiences, he realized\nthat being passive is the strongest\nstrategy. The immaculate heart purified\nhis spirit, causing a sharp decrease in\nthe total amount of spirit while rapidly\nincreasing its quality. When he consumed\nthe giant power fist and became all\nmuscle, it was the immaculate heart that\nremoved impurities from his body,\nresulting in the pure power unleashed by\nhis giant power fist. The current iron\nhearts is even more so, having\ntransformed crude iron into refined\niron, greatly enhancing its defensive\ncapabilities. The changes in Sumu's body\nlasted for a moment. After a while, the\nmetallic color on his body surface\ncompletely disappeared and it finally\nturned into a white jade color. He\nclenched his fist, feeling the power\nwithin his body and smiled slightly,\nquite satisfied. Surprise appeared on\nhis face and his hand unconsciously went\nto his throat. His throat is itchy, not\nthe physical throat, but the soul. He\ncould feel a mysterious change happening\nin the throat, the part of his soul.\nSuddenly, the crystallin blue in his\neyes surged. So much so that even his\nbrown tinted glasses couldn't hide it. A\nfull minute later, this change quietly\nstopped, and another law appeared deep\nwithin Sumu's soul. It was the second\nlaw that appeared out of thin air after\nall things in the universe, and its name\nwas endless demonic sound. I see. The\ncrystallin blue in Sumu's eyes had\ndisappeared, replaced by a look of\nenlightenment. He had finally figured\nout the origins of all things in the\nuniverse and endless demonic sound. They\nare like an independent law already\nexisting within one's own soul. And\nwhenever one's spiritual power reaches a\nsufficient level, it will trigger the\nopportunity for them to appear in the\nworld. The appearance of the all things\nin the universe is due to the\nenhancement of spiritual power after\nconnecting with the pure heart. The\nendless demonic sound is due to the iron\nwill increasing mental strength.\nPreviously during the hypnosis of Yong\nDongqing, it was discovered that iron\nwill has a certain mental resistance and\nits defensive power also increases when\nemotions are aroused or beliefs are\nstrengthened. All of this demonstrates\nthe enhancement of mental strength by\niron will. Actually, it makes sense when\nyou think about it. If the three bronze\nlaws, namely heart of steel, mighty\nfist, and unending recovery, only\nstrengthen the body and not the spirit,\nthen the extraordinary person who\npossessed the silver law, power servant,\nwould definitely become a musclebound\nidiot. The soul is too weak to control\nits powerful body. Even a random mental\nsuperhuman, even if the opponent is only\nat the bronze rank one, can easily toy\nwith the power servant. In conclusion,\nSumu concluded that his own unique laws\nwould naturally manifest once his mental\nstrength reached a certain level and he\nwould possess them immediately upon the\nright time, even without taking any\nother extraordinary drugs. Taking the\nextraordinary drug only shortens the\ntime required for this process. The\nreason why these laws are contained in\none's soul is probably related to that\nspecial dream. A dream that even the\ngods coveted. Muching, close your eyes.\nSumu suddenly turned to Muing and said\nhis voice seemed to have changed. It was\nstill the same voice, but it was deeper\nand more magnetic. As soon as he spoke,\npeople couldn't help but want to listen\nquietly. Muing looked puzzled, but still\nobediently closed her eyes. Mr. Su, why\nare you asking me to close my eyes? Sumu\nnarrowed his eyes slightly and did not\nanswer. He was naturally experimenting\nwith the endless demonic sound. Unlike\nthe visual illusion of myriad\nmanifestations, the endless demonic\nsound is a sound illusion. It can\ncontrol others through sound, arouse\nemotions, enhance persuasiveness, and\neven simulate various sounds as well as\nlaunch sonic attacks with the\ncombination of endless demonic sound and\nall things in the universe. The\nillusions he creates will be more\nrealistic with every movement sounding\nlike it has voice acting and they can\neven speak on their own. The effect is\nmore significant than the noble fantasm\nsilent heavenly music. After all, silent\nheavenly sound can only imitate sounds.\nBut the sound emitted by endless demonic\nsound also has illusionary properties.\nWhen facing ordinary people, it is\npractically equivalent to words becoming\nlaw. He can now make an ordinary person\ncommit suicide on the spot with just one\nsentence. Muing was his first test\nsubject. However, simply closing her\neyes wouldn't reveal anything. Muing\ntrusted herself quite a bit, and even\nwithout the endless demonic sound, the\nother party would most likely choose to\nclose their eyes anyway. Therefore, to\ntest the power, you must make the other\nperson do something they strongly\nresist. So, Sumu continued, \"Take off\nyour shirt.\" With her eyes tightly\nclosed, Muing showed a hint of\nresistance on her face, but her body\nseemed to be out of control as she\nreached out and grabbed the hem of her\nclothes, then began to lift it up. a\nslender fair waist adorned with pink\nopen work patterns. The scene abruptly\nended there. Muching abruptly put down\nher clothes, her fair face flushed red,\nher big eyes glaring angrily at Sumu,\nher little fists clenched tightly. You\nshut up. Her cherry pink lips seemed to\nbe pinched shut by someone's hand, her\nsmall mouth pursed and closed\ncompletely. Sumu seemed to be deep in\nthought. It seemed that the endless\ndemonic sound could slightly affect\nsilver transcendent beings, provided\nthat the other party trusted him to a\ncertain extent or was on guard. This\ninfluence depended on the other party's\nwill. Closing your eyes is a simple\nmatter that goes smoothly. But if you go\nagainst the other person's wishes, the\nmore serious the violation, the greater\nthe resistance you will encounter. To\ngive a simple example, if I were to ask\nMuing to commit suicide right now, she\nprobably wouldn't even lift a finger.\nChapter 174. gambling with life. Muching\ns pink lips kept pouting and closing\nlike a girl pouting cutely. Her face\nturned red and it took her a while to\nbreak free from her restraints. With a\nsoft pop, her little mouth opened. Sumu.\nShe seemed genuinely angry, calling Sumu\nby his full name. Just as she was about\nto utter some outrageous words, her\nexpression suddenly changed, becoming\nsolemn. He said urgently, \"A large group\nof people is rushing here from 500 m to\nthe southwest. They have touched my\nplants. If you have any solutions, use\nthem quickly or we're really going to\ndie here. Sumu's lips curled up\nslightly. Miss Moo seems to have a deep\nattachment to life. Whether it was\nfollowing me out to see or now, I can\nsense that you are not someone who is\nafraid of death. You must have something\nvery important to do. So, you don't want\nto die. The footsteps in the forest grew\ncloser, and Muin cried out anxiously. Is\nthis the time to talk about these\nthings? Who wants to die if they can\nlive? Huh? Sumu&lt;unk&gt;s smile grew even\nbrighter. What a coincidence. I want to\ndie. Muing was stunned. Before she could\nunderstand what Sumu meant, she saw him\nwalk step by step toward the sea. The\ncold, dark sea water submerged\nSumu&lt;unk&gt;s calves, and tiny waves kept\nlapping against him. But he ignored them\nand continued to walk step by step into\nthe sea. What are you trying to do?\nEscape from the sea? It's no use. The\nsea is the territory of the sea god's\nfollowers. If we can't&lt;unk&gt;t deal with\nit on land, what's the use of going to\nthe sea? Muing was almost frantic. Sumu\ncontinued walking, his gentle voice\nechoing from the seaside. Of course,\nI'll die in the sea. Don't forget, the\nsouls of all the drowned belong to the\nsea god. Maybe the sea god will take a\nliking to me and make me a servant of\nthe sea god. Muing was dumbfounded,\nthinking that Su Mu was a madman. What\nkind of method was this? I will be back\nin 5 minutes. Please wait patiently for\n5 minutes, Miss Mu. Of course, if I\ndon't return, you can use the poison\nsack hidden in your mers to commit\nsuicide. Muing was shaken to her core,\ncompletely losing her composure. She\ndidn't know what Sumu was up to, or how\nhe knew she had poisoned him, but all\nshe knew now was that she had no choice\nbut to trust him. She could not possibly\ndefeat the entire sea kingdom by herself\nalone. If Sumu did not return in 5\nminutes, she would bite through the\npoison sack and commit suicide. Because\nshe knew perfectly well what awaited her\nif she fell into the hands of these\nbeasts. Gradually, Sumu's body\ncompletely disappeared into the dark\nsea. He emptied all the oxygen from his\nlungs and swam continuously toward the\ndeep sea. Before long, a feeling of\ntightness and shortness of breath came\nover him, and a sickly redness appeared\non his fair face. But he was still\ndownstream. He wasn't lying. His purpose\nin entering the sea was to drown\nhimself. This was a plan he devised on\nhis very first day in the sea kingdom.\nFor him, the real threat was never the\nsea kingdom or the sea god's retinue,\nbut the eternal celestial venerable who\nexisted in his soul like a time bomb. As\nlong as the divinity of the eternal\nheavenly venerable is not cleared, then\neven if he kills the sea god's retinue,\nit will be of no use. s divinity on the\nother party did slow down the speed of\nthe longevity celestial venerables\ninvasion. However, the sea god s\ndivinity available on the sea god's\nretinue was too weak. Even if the sea\ngods retinue were killed, it would only\ndelay the invasion for a few days at\nmost. Therefore, from the very\nbeginning, he set his sights on the sea\ngod. This sea is an extension of the sea\ngod's power, and the souls of all the\ndrowned will belong to the sea god. His\nplan was to drown himself in the sea so\nthat the sea god would take his soul.\nThen the interesting part would begin.\nHis soul was already considered by the\neternal heavenly venerable to be his for\nthe taking. The thought of the two gods\nfighting over his soul made Sumu want to\nlaugh. How interesting. How truly\ninteresting. Undeniably, this was a\nhighstakes gamble, a gamble with lives\nat stake. But he enjoyed the thrill of\nthe gamble and the feeling of\ncontrolling the gods with his mortal\nbody. The celestial venerable of\nlongevity wants my soul, doesn't he?\nI'll just put it in the hands of the sea\ngod. Come and take it if you dare. As\nfor Hu Jia, a follower of the sea god.\nSorry, I've never taken him seriously.\nWith such a crazy idea in mind, Sumu's\nconsciousness began to blur. His senses\nbecame dulled and the whole world seemed\nto fall silent. The intense feeling of\nsuffocation made his lungs feel like\nthey were about to explode. He could\nonly feel himself sinking, sinking\nendlessly. ashore. Muing was already\nsurrounded by Hu Jia and the others who\nhad arrived. The seriously injured Yong\nDonging and Lu Dong Leyong were also\ndragged along by Pang Yong like dead\ndogs, leaving two long trails of blood\non the ground, thanks to the fact that\nboth of them were superhumans. Pangyong\nwasn't afraid of killing them at all and\nsimply dragged them along for\nconvenience. \"Miss Mu, where did Sumu\ngo?\" Hujia asked in a sinister tone, his\neyes narrowed. Muing suppressed her\npanic and calmly said, \"I don't know.\nAbandoned all of you and run away alone.\nIt's&lt;unk&gt; a wise choice. If it were me,\nI would definitely run away when faced\nwith the siege of a country.\"\nMuing&lt;unk&gt;s heart tightened. She also\nhad some doubts about whether Su Mu had\nreally run away. Otherwise, why would he\nwant to commit suicide in the sea? She\nhas her doubts, but some people don't.\nHar, he won't run away. A faint laugh\nsuddenly rang out. Who? Jeff rounded and\nturned to look. The one who laughed was\nYong Daing. This kid must have woken up\nat this moment because he was being\ndragged. Kid looks like you and Sumu\nhave a good relationship. You're\nactually hoping he'll come to save you.\nSave me? Huh? Yong Dona, his face\ncovered in blood, laughed even louder,\ntears welling up in his eyes as if he\nhad heard a hilarious joke. What are you\nlaughing at? Hu J's eyes flashed with\ncold light. I laugh at you all for not\nunderstanding that madman. I said he\nwouldn't run away. Not because he was\nworried about me and was planning to\ncome back to save me, but because he's a\nmad man. He wouldn't run away. How could\nhe possibly run away? The whole country\nis at odds with him. He won't miss such\nan interesting opportunity. I bet he's\nhiding among you right now, probably\nlaughing at you. The slightly manic\nwords that came out of Yong\nDonging&lt;unk&gt;s mouth, coupled with his\nbloodstained face, gave people a\nchilling feeling. The chill intensified\nwhen they thought that Su Mujan might be\nlurking among the crowd. silently\nwatching them like a ghost. Suddenly,\nthe sea breeze seemed even colder.\nChapter 175. Sumu is dead. Hujia's\ngloomy gaze swept over everyone. He also\nsuspected that Sumu might have already\nblended into the crowd. If the other\nparty could disguise others as himself,\nhe could naturally disguise himself as\nsomeone else as well. However, he was\nnot afraid of Sumu's sneak attack\nbecause this was not his real body at\nall, but a paper doll clone. Sumu, no\nmatter where you hide, you can't escape.\nAfter I deal with them, you're next.\nMake your move. At Hu Jia's command,\nseveral extraordinary individuals\nattacked Muing. Having been on high\nalert and fully prepared, Muing rushed\nto the nearby woods immediately. Bang,\nbang, bang. Several myithal bullets shot\nout, among which were more than a dozen\nfive-finger flame bullets. Muing's body\nwas covered by the attack. She\ndesperately twisted her body and\nnarrowly avoided vital parts, falling\ninto the woods. Even so, she was shot\nseveral times and had burn marks on her\nthighs and forearms. Her once fair and\ndelicate skin was now charred and\nblackened. But these injuries healed\ninstantly at a speed visible to the\nnaked eye after she touched the trees,\nwhile a large number of the trees she\ntouched withered as if their life force\nhad been drained away. Upon seeing this,\nHu Jia, the nightmare apostle who had\nsurvived for 10 years, was shocked. He\nrecognized the law that Muing was using.\nThis is not nature's call. It is silver\nsequence 111, wood spirits breath. What?\nIt's actually the legendary breath of\nthe wood spirit. A greedy glint flashed\nin Pangyang&lt;unk&gt;s eyes. Legend has it\nthat the breath of the wood spirit has\nan extremely high affinity with plants.\nIt is a darling of nature. It can not\nonly control plants, but also extract\nthe essence of various extraordinary\nmaterials, perfectly fuse them, and\nrefine extraordinary potions. More than\n50% of the world's extraordinary potions\nwere created by the breath of wood\nspirit. This is why the breath of wood\nspirit, which is relatively weak in\nattack, is ranked so high. Old, we've\nstruck it rich this time. As long as we\ncatch muing, we'll have a never-ending\nsupply of extraordinary potions. A fiery\nglint appeared in Hujia's eyes. He even\nwondered if he could use Muing to create\nsome extraordinary potions that would\ngive him human perception so that he\nwould never have to live like a turtle\nagain. Although he was a follower of the\nsea god, he was once a living human\nbeing. He longed for fine wine,\ndelicious food, and beautiful women.\nBeing a follower of the sea god granted\nhim immortality, but he lost all the\njoys of being human. Quick, everyone,\nattack together. We must capture Muing.\nRemember, she must be alive. No one can\nhurt her. Hu Jia shouted urgently.\nOriginally, he only wanted to use Muing\nas a breeding tool, but now his thoughts\nhave completely changed. Such a talent\nmust be locked in a dark room and made\nto refine extraordinary potions 24 hours\na day. Miss Mu, give up. We won't hurt\nyou. Your abilities are extremely\nvaluable. As long as you surrender\nobediently, I, Huia, guarantee that I\nwon't lay a finger on you. In fact, I'll\ntreat you like an honored guest. You\nwon't have to do anything in the future.\nAll you need to do is refine\nextraordinary potions. I'll guarantee\nyou a lifetime of wealth and honor. Deep\nin the woods, Muing, who was running at\ntop speed, heard these words, and her\neyes revealed the chilling coldness as\nif recalling some unpleasant memory.\nSuddenly, she took out a bottle of light\nred potion that was constantly bubbling\nfrom her bosom. Her eyes resolute,\nopened the cap, and drank it all in one\ngulp. A violent force surged from her\npetite body, and her delicate face was\ncontorted with pain. At the same time,\nthe trees in the entire forest began to\ngrow wildly, and countless wooden thorns\nand snake-like vines began to spread. In\nan instant, all the plants seemed to\ncome alive, frantically strangling the\nsurrounding enemies. Some soldiers died\non the spot, their bodies crushed by\nplants. The situation was also very bad\nfor those superhumans who had not\nreached the silver realm. Under the\nattack from all 360 degrees, casualties\nbegan to appear. However, Muing as\nsituation was still very difficult.\nAlthough her attack range was large, she\ncould not hurt the silver transcendent\nat all. The power servant who had\ndefeated Yong Donging earlier completely\nignored the frenzy trees around her and\nalmost pushed forward while enduring the\nattacks. The superhuman whose figure\nmoved like a ghost, weaving through the\ngaps in the tree attacks without a\nsingle leaf touching him. When he\nencountered trees that he couldn't\ndodge, his Mithil dagger flashed up and\ndown, cutting them to shreds. Before\nlong, Muing was blocked by the two men,\nand her situation was extremely\ndangerous. But Sumu was already dead at\nthis point. In the icy seaater, a pale\ncorpse floated. His face showed no fear\nof death, only a perfectly curved smile,\nas if he were expecting something. From\na perspective invisible to the naked\neye, the deep sea emits an eerie buzzing\nsound at this moment. Suddenly, a vast,\nmysterious, and irresistible force as\nboundless as the ocean emerged. This\nforce seemed to come from a higher\ndimension, completely exceeding the\nlimits of human imagination. A rich blue\nlight surged into Sumu's body and began\nto tug at his soul. The ocean is the\ndomain of the sea god, and the souls of\nall the drowned belong to the sea god.\nSo, the sea god's power began to collect\nSumu's soul as always. However,\nsomething unusual happened. Under the\ninfluence of that powerful force, Sumu's\ntranslucent soul began to slowly float\nout of his body. But the next second,\nhis soul suddenly stopped as if pulled\nby something and then whooshed back into\nhis body. At the same time, another\nsupreme power emerged, and a terrifying\nblue light almost died the entire sea\nblue. In his dream, Sumu excitedly\nexamined the statue of the eternal\nheavenly venerable before him. The\ntowering statue's face showed a look of\nfury as if it had been provoked. The\npower of the celestial venerable of\nimmortality continued to erupt, driving\naway the blue light that had invaded the\ndream. How could he not be angry? He had\nhis prey in his sights and was about to\nsucceed when another god interfered.\nEven gods have anger. Similarly, the sea\ngod was also enraged. Since ancient\ntimes, the souls of all those who\ndrowned belonged to him. and the actions\nof the eternal life celestial venerable\nwere tantamount to stealing food from\nhis bowl. Boom! Suddenly, dark clouds\ngathered over the sea. Lightning flashed\nand thunder roared and a suffocating\natmosphere of terror swept across the\nentire ocean. The cold, dark seaater\nchurned wildly, and towering waves\nhundreds of meters high frequently\nappeared, creating a scene reminiscent\nof the end of the world. On the shore,\nMuing, covered in wounds, collapsed to\nthe ground. The trees around her already\nturned into raging flames and burned to\nashes. The best way to deal with her is\nto clear away the surrounding trees so\nthat she can no longer rely on the\nvitality of the trees to recover\nherself, and she will eventually be\ndefeated. Just as Hujia and his men were\ngrinning and preparing to capture her, a\nhuge thunderclap sounded in the sky, and\nthe terrifying lightning almost\nilluminated the entire sea kingdom,\nmaking it as bright as day. Hujia and\nthe others were startled. Looking\naround, they were instantly terrified.\nThe once calm sea was now boiling\nviolently like water in a pot.\nFurthermore, blue and cyan colors\nemerged from the seabed, even staining\nthe pitch black sky. Two opposing\nsupreme divine powers slowly spread out,\nand everyone was instantly horrified,\ntheir faces turning deathly pale, and\nthey all froze on the spot. Chapter 176.\nResurrection and immortality. What? What\non earth is going on? Huji exclaimed in\nhorror. Muing, who had fallen to the\nground, struggled to lift her head.\nBlood blurred her vision. She looked at\nthe sea shrouded in blue and cyan and\nsuddenly smiled. Her once snow white\nteeth were now stained red with blood,\nbut she smiled very happily, her\nbeautiful eyes filled with a strange\nlight. 5 minutes are up. What? 5 minutes\nare up. What are you talking about? Huia\nlooked at Muing in horror. Among\neveryone present, he was the most\nterrified because no one understood the\npower of the sea god better than him. A\ndeity entered the sea and is now\nclashing with the sea god. He dared not\neven imagine a battle between gods. Such\nbeings could destroy the entire sea\nkingdom with a single glance. Muing gave\nhim a cold smile. Your death day has\ncome. After saying that, she seemed to\nhave been drained of her last bit of\nstrength and her head lulled to the side\nas she fainted. Fu Jia&lt;unk&gt;s eyes\nwidened in horror. Muing&lt;unk&gt;s words had\ntriggered a deep unease within him. Deep\nsea blue and green light had already\ncompletely covered Su Mu&lt;unk&gt;s corpse\nand they were fighting each other\nfiercely as if vying for territory,\nneither giving way. This is merely an\nexternal manifestation. The real intense\nconfrontation takes place in dreams. In\nhis dream, next to the towering statue\nof the eternal heavenly venerable, a\nmonster of the same height appeared out\nof nowhere. This monster's body was\nsimilar to a human, but its head was\nlike an octopus, covered with writhing\nblack fleshy tentacles. The fleshy\ntentacles were incredibly thick and\nstudded with scarlet eyeballs. Its body\nis covered with dense green scales. Its\nlimbs are huge claws, and it has a pair\nof huge bat-like wings on its back. Its\nabnormal deformity and unnatural\nappearance constantly challenge human\ncognition. At this moment, countless\ntranslucent tentacles emerged from\nbeneath the wide robes of the eternal\nlife celestial venerable, frantically\ncoiling towards the sea god. The sea\ngod, naturally unwilling to be outdone,\ncaused his black fleshy whiskers to\nswell dramatically. The scene became\nextremely bizarre with billions of\ntranslucent tentacles and billions of\nblack fleshy tendrils intertwined,\ntearing and tangling wildly. From a\ndistance, it looks like two gods\ndevouring and merging with each other.\nSumu stared intently, the two completely\ndifferent murmurss wildly affecting his\nreason. Yet, he became increasingly\nexcited. What a wonderful scene. He was\npractically clapping and cheering from\nthe sidelines. It's still unclear\nwhether the celestial venerable of\nimmortality or the sea god is stronger.\nBut Sumu feels that the celestial\nvenerable of immortality is stronger\nbecause the power he used only came from\nthe statues in the immortality temple.\nThe sea god is this ocean and it is\ndifficult for humans to intuitively\nunderstand the levels of strength of\nthis power. They can only roughly\ndistinguish them by size. The eternal\nheavenly venerable is a statue and the\nsea god is this ocean. Now the two are\nlocked in a stalemate and it is obvious\nwho is stronger. It seems the true form\nof the sea god is not here. Sumu's eyes\nflickered. He didn't know what form the\nsea god existed in. But he knew that\nwhat was in front of him was definitely\nnot the true form of the sea god. If all\nthe oceans in the nightmare world are\nsea gods, then this ocean can only be\nconsidered a part of the sea god. This\nwas something he had anticipated. If the\ntrue form of the sea god was indeed\nhere, then there would certainly be no\nliving person in the sea kingdom. In\nother words, the size of this nightmare\nwas simply too small to accommodate a\ntrue god. That is why Su Mu thought of\nsuicide. If the sea god's true form were\ngone, he would definitely not commit\nsuicide because that would be certain\ndeath. No matter how strong the eternal\nheavenly venerable is, he cannot fight\nagainst a complete god with only the\ndivinity attached to the statue. At this\npoint, the celestial venerable of\nimmortality and the sea god were almost\ncompletely covered by tentacles and\nfleshy tendrils, making it impossible to\nsee their true forms. The stalemate\nbetween them continued. Sumu smiled\nsilently. This was the best outcome for\nhim. No matter which of the two gods\nwon, he would die forever. So, the best\noutcome was for them to remain locked in\na stalemate. Of course, he knew this\nstalemate wouldn't last long. Like two\nstrong men arm wrestling, after a long\nstalemate, one of them would eventually\nrun out of strength and the other would\nwin. However, while they were locked in\na stalemate, Sumu was able to free up\nhis hands to do something else. Whoosh!\nIn the endless depths of the sea, Sumu's\ncorpse suddenly opened its eyes. He\nlived, but not fully. To be precise, his\ncurrent state is similar to that of an\nimmortal siren. His body has been\naffected by the power of the sea god,\nmaking him immortal. This is how the\nimmortal sea monster came to be.\nDrowning in the sea, its soul was taken\naway by the sea god and its body became\nan immortal sea monster driven by the\nsea god. He had completed all the steps\nand the dead body was also affected by\nthe power of the sea god naturally\nturning into an immortal sea monster.\nHowever, he succeeded but unfortunately\nthe sea god failed to take away his soul\nwhich resulted in Sumu still possessing\nhuman perception. He is now an immortal\nsea monster with human perception, a\nstate that Hujia has always dreamed of.\nFurthermore, because the power of the\nsea god resides within his soul, he\npossesses a sea god divinity far\nexceeding that of Huia, a follower of\nthe sea god. Ashure, Hu Jia and the\nothers looked at the sea, still shaken.\nThe sea had calmed down and seemed as if\nnothing had happened. Old Hu, what\nexactly happened just now? Did the sea\ngod get angry? Pingong asked, his voice\ntrembling slightly. Hu Jia&lt;unk&gt;'s eyes\nflashed and he followed the other\nperson's words. That's right. It must be\nthat the sea god is angry. He is angry\nthat we haven't killed Sumu yet.\nEveryone listen up. We must find and\nkill Sumu before the sea god is\ncompletely enraged. A chill ran through\neveryone. A sense of urgency washing\nover them. And they were about to take\naction. But just then, someone in the\ncrowd suddenly cried out, \"Ah, hey, a\nsiren. The siren is here.\" Everyone was\ninstantly shocked and quickly looked\ntowards the sea. What they saw made\ntheir scalps tingle. A sea of people\nthronged the vast ocean. A dense mass of\nhuman heads floated on the water and\nthose heads continued to rise, revealing\ntheir full form. Those were rotting\nbodies, empty eye sockets, and writhing\nblack tendrils. The undead sea monsters.\nThe endless sea monsters seemed to\noccupy the entire ocean at first glance.\nWhile in the deeper sea, colossal\ncreatures hundreds of meters tall rose\nup like mountains rising from the sea.\nWhat? What's going on? Didn't the sea\ngod give us 3 days to kill Sumu? The\ntime hasn't come yet. They They're not\nplanning to completely destroy the sea\nkingdom, are they? Old who? Old who?\nCan't you contact the sea god's\nfamiliar? Go and explain to him.\nPangyang shook Hu Jia with a face full\nof fear. But Hu Jia seemed not to hear,\nstaring intently at the dark, monstrous\narmy of sea monsters, his mind reeling.\nGo back. Go back. Who let you out? He\nkept urging himself on, trying to\ncontrol the immortal sea monster as\nusual, but none of the sea monster army\npaid him any attention. Instead, they\ncontinued to approach the shore. Old Hu,\nyou damn well better say something. I Hu\nJia's mind was in turmoil, and he had no\nidea what had happened. Suddenly, he saw\na giant sea beast slowly extend its huge\ntentacles and stand on top of tens of\nthousands of sea monsters. At the tip of\nthe tentacles stood a tall and slender\nhuman figure. Chapter 177. I heard you\nwere looking for me. Wearing a sharp\nblack suit, carrying an elegant\nsnakeskin cane and sporting a gentle\nsmile, Sumu stood quietly at top the\ngiant tentacle like an elegant gentleman\nwho had stepped out of a classical\npainting. Beneath his feet lay a surging\nsea and an endless army of undead sea\nmonsters. He looked down from the sky,\nappearing like a god or demon emerging\nfrom the deep sea. The moment he\nappeared, the world could no longer\naccommodate any other sound. Only his\nvoice echoed throughout the entire\nworld. Gentlemen, I heard, \"You've been\nlooking for me?\" Splash! Splash! The\nwaves crashed against the rocks like war\ndrums beating for him. The gale whipped\nup dark clouds like a trumpet being\nsounded for him. Hu Jia and the others\non the shore, including the soldiers and\ncitizens of the sea kingdom, were all\ncompletely silent, a deathly stillness.\nEveryone's faces were filled with\ndisbelief. They stared dumbfounded at\nthe figure standing in midair, whose\ngentle smile was unusually dazzling.\nSuzumu, Hu Jia, cried out in a terrified\nvoice, his voice even distorted from\nshock. What on earth is going on? Why\ncan he control the sea monster army?\nIsn't this the authority of the sea\ngod's followers? Pangyang&lt;unk&gt;s fat body\ntrembled incessantly. Even the two of\nthem didn't know what had happened, so\nthe others were even more confused. They\nhad originally been ordered by the sea\ngods followers to hunt down Sumu, but in\nthe end, Sumu appeared with a sea\nmonster army. Yang Donging stared in\ndisbelief at Sumu, who appeared as if a\ngod had descended, forgetting even the\npain in his body. He knew Sumu wouldn't\nrun away, but he never expected such a\npowerful return. In his limited\nunderstanding, he thought that Sumu was\njust hiding in the crowd, hypnotizing a\nfew of his underlings, and then\nlaunching a sneak attack and\ncounterattack. Now, it seems this wasn't\na sneak attack at all. It was clearly a\nplanned sweep. Yuyu, what have you done?\nHow can you control these sea monsters?\nHujia roared in disbelief. Sumu smiled\nslightly. It's very simple. I'll just\nbecome a member of the sea gods family.\nHe slowly scanned the astonished crowd,\nthe moonlight reflecting off his brown\ntinted glasses, making it impossible to\nsee the deep eyes hidden behind them.\nAll citizens of the Sea Kingdom, heed my\ncommand. King Hujia has angered the sea\ngod. Kill Hu Jia before dawn to ensure\nthe safety of the Sea Kingdom.\nOtherwise, I will raise the sea kingdom\nto the ground and leave no one alive.\"\nUpon hearing this, everyone was stunned.\nWhy did this word sound so familiar? It\nseemed like they had just heard it not\nlong ago. Isn't this a poem by King\nHujia? The way people looked at Hu Jia\nbegan to become strange and some even\nsecretly tightened their grip on their\nweapons. Sensing the tense atmosphere,\nHujia's eyes flashed with fear and he\nsaid, his voice trembling with fear.\nDon't listen to his nonsense. I haven't\nangered the sea god. I haven't. Sumu,\nyou're lying. You're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] lying. On\nthe tentacle, Sumu silently pushed up\nhis brown glasses and said calmly, I am\na follower of the sea god. I said, \"You\nhave angered the sea god, and you have\nangered the sea god. Aren't you going to\nmake your move?\" As he calmly\nquestioned, a massive army of undead sea\nmonsters began to slowly approach. With\ndozens of hundred me tall sea beasts\nroaring violently, they twisted their\nmassive bodies, instantly creating\ntowering waves on the sea. Their power\nastonishing, the crashing waves even\nlapped at everyone's feet, submerging\ntheir calves. Such terrifying power\nturned everyone's faces pale. They\ndidn't care about the truth or who had\nangered the sea god. All they knew was\nthat if they didn't listen to Sumu, they\nwould die. Under the pressure of life\nand death, more and more people began to\nturn their weapons around and aimed them\nat Huia. Even his best friend Ping Yong\nwas the same. Ping Yong pressed closer,\na ferocious glint flashing in his eyes.\nOld who? Don't blame me. Although I\ndon't know why Mr. Su suddenly became a\nfollower of the sea god. The power to\ncontrol sea monsters and the sea cannot\nbe faked. For the sake of the people of\nthe sea kingdom, I can only ask you to\nmake this difficult. Ping Yong Yu Hu\nJia&lt;unk&gt;s eyes were bloodshot. He never\ndreamed that such a ridiculous scene\nwould actually happen to him. Just now,\nPang Yang was saying that he would let\nSu Mood die for the sake of the people.\nBut now he turned around and applied the\nsame words to himself. Alas, I had no\nchoice but to do this. As you know, we\nhave always been livestock living in the\nsea kingdom, and the sea gods retinue\nare the masters of the livestock. We\nreally cannot disobey his orders. Seeing\nthat Pang Yang was about to make a move,\nthe other hesitant superhumans also\nturned fierce and surrounded Hu Jia. You\ncan't do this to me. I I He hesitated\nfor a long time, but finally gritted his\nteeth and said, \"I am the one who\nbelongs to the sea god.\" Finally, Hujia\nrevealed his biggest hidden secret. But\nno one believed him at all. Old who?\nWhat nonsense are you talking about?\nWe've known each other for 5 years. Do\nyou think I don't know whether you're a\nmember of the sea gods family or not?\nPing Yang said with a look of regret.\nDon't worry. After you die, I will take\ncare of your concubines and treat your\nchildren as my own. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you, Pang Yong.\nYou're a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] idiot. Hu Jia&lt;unk&gt;'s\nface suddenly contorted into a ferocious\ngrin. He roared at the approaching crowd\nlike a mad man. I am a member of the sea\ngods family. I am the true member of the\nsea gods family. At this moment, Sumu\nMu&lt;unk&gt;s calm voice rang out. The sinner\nwho Jian not only offended the sea god\nbut also dared to impersonate a member\nof the sea god's retinue. His crime is\ncompounded. You citizens of the sea\nkingdom had better give me a\nsatisfactory explanation or the sea\nkingdom will be completely submerged\nbefore sunrise. Pangyang was immediately\nalarmed and no longer cared about their\npast friendship. So he ruthlessly\nattacked Hujia. The other extraordinary\nindividuals were no different,\nunleashing countless terrifying attacks\ntowards Hujia. In an instant, Hu\nJia&lt;unk&gt;s body was torn to pieces,\nturning into scraps of paper on the\nground. Ping Yang&lt;unk&gt;s eyes flickered\nuncertainly as he said in a gloomy tone,\n\"This is Lawus ability. Paper cutting\nevil spirit. I know him best. This\nability can only be activated within a\nthousand meters. He can't run far. Leave\nit to me,\" said a middle-aged man\ndressed in the attire of a minister from\nthe sea kingdom. He picked up a scrap of\npaper from the ground and put it in his\nmouth. I have insight. Suddenly, he saw\nHu Jia fleeing through a row of houses.\nHe's heading northwest. Go after him.\nSo, a large group of people went after\nHu Jia. Chapter 178. I am the true\nfollower of the sea god. Yong Donging,\nwho had been thrown to the ground,\nstruggled to his feet. He felt as if he\nwere in a dream, as if the roles of\noffense and defense had been reversed.\nHe couldn't help but recall what Sumu\nhad said to him and the others before.\nThe people of this island nation only\nfear power and do not cherish virtue.\nThey listen to whomever they fear more.\nOn the streets of the northwest corner\nof the sea kingdom, Hu Jia ran for his\nlife. His mind in turmoil, frantically\nsearching for a solution. Where should\nwe escape to? His first thought was to\nescape into the sea. But then he\nrealized that Sumu had completely taken\naway his power, which meant that the\nocean was also under the other party's\ncontrol. Wouldn't escaping into the sea\nbe suicide? You should know that these\nsuperhumans can't kill him, but Sumu\ncan. A damn it. What on earth is going\non? As the figure behind him kept\ngetting closer, Huia became more and\nmore distraught. He clearly still had\nthe power of the sea god within him. So\nwhy couldn't he summon the sea monster?\nHe was clearly the true servant of the\nsea god. So why did the entire ocean\nlisten to Sumu? Logically speaking, only\nthe sea god should be able to control\nthe sea beyond himself. Whoosh! A flash\nof cold light slashed across Hujia's\nthroat. It was that silverranked\nsuperhuman who moved like a ghost. He\nwas the fastest, so he naturally caught\nup with Hujia the fastest and attacked\nwith a killing move. With the sound of\npaper being torn, Huia's throats split\nopen, but what was revealed was not\nflesh and blood, but green scales. Upon\nseeing this, Huia was not angry at all,\nbut rather overjoyed. He stopped and\nquickly tore off all the paper skin\ncovering his body, revealing his true\nform as a follower of the sea god. A\nhumanoid monster covered in green\nscales. Did you see that? I am the real\nsea god servant. You've all been fooled\nby Sumu, who jatted the scales on his\nbody, trying his best to prove himself.\nHe wanted to hide his identity as much\nas he did back then, and now he wants to\nprove it just as much. Everyone was\nstunned, looking at Hu Jia, who had\nturned into a monster. with surprise and\nuncertainty. For a moment, they\nhesitated, not understanding the\nsituation at all. At this moment, for\nfigures walked out from the end of the\nstreet, they were Sum Mu and the\nseriously injured Muing and others.\nBehind them was a dark, overwhelming\narmy of sea monsters. The pungent stench\nof decay spread wildly through the\nstreets of the Sea Kingdom as the sirens\narmy entered, causing widespread nausea.\nThe dull thud of their footsteps and the\ndripping of the sea water awakened the\nnightmares in everyone's hearts. Having\nlived in the sea kingdom for many years,\ntheir fear of sea monsters was ingrained\nin their bones. Now seeing the sea\nmonster army land, some people even\ntrembled with fear, afraid that the sea\nkingdom would be forcefully destroyed at\nany moment. It seems you are all people\nof great loyalty and righteousness.\nSince you are unwilling to kill Hujia,\nthen let's die together. Sumu slowly\nraised his palm and waved his hand. The\nsirens army behind him was about to\nlaunch an attack. Everyone&lt;unk&gt;s\nexpression changed drastically. Pangyong\nshouted, \"Sir, please wait. We will kill\nHu Jia right now.\" Sumu raised his hand\nto stop the sea monster army behind him\nand smiled. There's still an hour until\nsunrise. Everyone felt a chill run down\ntheir spines and dared not waste any\nmore time. Hurry up. Don't keep the sea\ngods familiar waiting. Ping Yong was the\nmost enthusiastic. Hu Jia's current\nappearance is definitely a disguise\nusing the paper cut evil spirit. Kill\nhim. Hu Jia was so angry he almost\nvomited blood, but unfortunately he had\nno blood left. The world's magical\nnature has exceeded his imagination. He\nonce used the paper cut evil spirit to\ndisguise himself as a human and everyone\nbelieved him. Now that he has\nvoluntarily revealed his true form, he\nis being accused of disguising himself.\nIs there any justice left? More than 20\nextraordinary individuals attacked\ntogether, and even someone as strong as\nHu Jia found himself in grave danger.\nCountless paper figures flew out from\nhis body and joined the fry. Standing\nbehind Sumu, Muing was already numb with\nshock because she had been unconscious\nbefore, so she had no idea what had\nhappened. She only remembered that Sumu\nhad agreed to meet her in 5 minutes.\nWhen the 5 minutes were up and she woke\nup again, she saw Sumu leading a sea\nmonster army to surround the sea\nkingdom. The people of the sea kingdom,\nwho were once enemies, had now turned\nagainst her and began to besiege Hujia,\nthe true follower of the sea god. The\nmost bizarre thing is that Hu Jia, who\noriginally wanted to hide his identity,\nactually revealed it himself, and nobody\nbelieved him. She couldn't help but look\nat Sumu's tall and straight back, her\nbeautiful eyes sparkling with wonder.\nShe now completely understood why Sumu\nsaid there was no need to turn the\ntables. It's really unnecessary. It's\nalways Hu who Jia who's in dire straits.\nShe also realized how ridiculous her\nprevious plan to expose Hu Jia's true\nidentity had been. The truth was never\nimportant. The people of this island\nnation take sides regardless of justice\nor truth. They side with whoever is\nstronger. In a short time, Huia had\nalready sustained multiple injuries. It\nwas true that he was a follower of the\nsea god, but his greatest power came\nfrom the sea and the army of sea\nmonsters. But now all of those reliance\nwere gone. Now he can only rely on the\npaper cut evil spirit and the\nimmortality of the sea god's followers\ndie. The superhuman power servant seized\nthe opportunity and punched Hu Jia in\nthe head from behind. Bang! The ugly\nhead shattered instantly and the attacks\nfrom the others followed closely behind.\nIn almost an instant, Hu Jia was torn to\npieces. Whoosh! His mangled body turned\ninto a pool of foul smelling seaater\nscattered on the ground. Everyone was\nstunned when they saw this scene. After\ndeath, it turned into sea water. Isn't\nthis a sea monster? Actually, everyone\nwasn't stupid. Some people had already\nvaguely sensed that something was wrong.\nThe sea god's familiar first said that\nhe wanted to hunt down Sumu, but then\nSumu turned around and became the sea\ngod's familiar, wanting to kill Hujia.\nIf there wasn't something fishy going\non, no one would believe it. Even if\nthey knew there was a problem, they\ncouldn't possibly say it, much less\nquestion the identity of Sumahai's\nfollowers, unless they wanted to die.\nPretending to be ignorant when you know\nthe truth is the way to survive.\nSuddenly, the pool of foul smelling\nseaater surged and transformed back into\nHuia's appearance. Har, now you believe\nme, right? I am the true follower of the\nsea god, and I am unkillable. Ping Yong\nglanced discreetly at Sumu who was\nsurrounded by the sea monster army and\nimmediately shouted at Huia. Everyone\ndon't believe his words. I know old\nbest. Besides the paper cut evil spirit,\nhe also has a hidden illusion ability.\nAll of this is an illusion he created.\nQuickly capture him and hand him over to\nthe sea gods familiar. Pingyong, you son\nof a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] When did I hide my illusion\nabilities? Huia completely broke down,\ncursing wildly. Pangyang&lt;unk&gt;s eyes\nflickered. He naturally knew that Lauu\nwas innocent. After all, only those who\nwronged you knew how wronged you were.\nHe had no choice but to go along with\nSu's words if he didn't want to die.\nChapter 179. You all heard it, right? He\nadmitted that he was the fake one. Among\nthe nightmare apostles were many\nintelligent individuals who naturally\nunderstood Pangyang&lt;unk&gt;s meaning. They\nimmediately shouted, \"Pingong, why waste\nyour breath on him? Charge at him side\nby side. You, you all,\" Hu J's eyes were\nbloodshot. his madness growing as he\nfaced death. I'm going to kill you\ntraitors. At this moment, Sumuru&lt;unk&gt;s\nrefined voice rang out. What he said is\ntrue. In fact, Mr. Who is the real\nSeagds favorite while I am just an\nimpostor. Everyone's expressions froze\ninstantly, not understanding why Su Mu\nwould expose this obvious lie. Was he\ngoing to settle scores with everyone?\nHaha, did you all hear that? He admitted\nit. He admitted it himself. He's a fake.\nI'm the real one. Huja laughed\nmaniacally. Sumu stared at him, a\nhandsome smile curving his lips. That's\nright, Mr. Who is indeed a member of the\nSea Gods family. So, for the future of\nthe Sea Kingdom and for the justice of\nhumanity, please arrest this true member\nof the Sea Gods family. Yes, Mr. Su.\nPang Yang was the first to respond, and\nhe attacked Hu Jia without any mercy.\nHujia, you damned follower of the sea\ngod. For all these years, you have\ndisguised yourself as the king and\nsecretly devoured the souls of your\npeople. Your crimes are unforgivable. We\nare fortunate to have Mr. Sue uphold\njustice today, and we will certainly act\non behalf of heaven. At that moment,\neveryone seemed to be the embodiment of\njustice. Heroes acting on behalf of\nheaven, fearlessly charging towards the\ndumbfounded Hujia. If we disregard the\nprocess and only look at the outcome of\nthis scene, everyone would think it's a\nfairy tale ending where the hero exposes\nthe monster king's true identity and\nleads his deceived people to unite and\ndefeat evil. Muching and the others who\nwitnessed the whole process felt only\ndeep irony. All this talk about being a\nfollower of the sea god, about fighting\nfor the sea kingdom, about justice, it's\nall just a facade, all just slogans. And\nso surrounded by a group of immortal sea\nmonsters, the 20 odd nightmare apostles\nand the sea gods retinue engaged in a\nlife or death struggle. I want you all\nto die. Die. The roar of countless souls\nechoed within Huia's body, and his body\nbegan to expand strangely with black\nfleshy tendrils on his body extending\nrapidly like countless venomous snakes.\nThe two nightmare apostles, unable to\ndodge in time, were directly struck by\nthe black fleshy whiskers, letting out\nviolent screams before their souls were\nripped away. Hujia completely lost his\nmind and launched a frenzied attack on\nthe remaining nightmare apostles. Faced\nwith the immortal Hujia, they could only\nparry his attacks. After killing or\nwounding more than a dozen nightmare\napostles, Hujia was finally brought\nunder complete control. Its body was\npinned to the ground by a spear, and it\nwas also bound by a dense array of\nchains with its hands and feet removed.\nThe battered and bruised Pangyang and\nhis men approached Sumu, their faces\nfilled with exhaustion and\nobsequiousness. Mr. Su, I have not\nfailed you. Sumu smiled slightly. You\ndid a good job. You can go die now. Ping\nYang and the others expressions changed\ndrastically. No, no, no, Mr. Su, you\ncan't&lt;unk&gt;t kill us. We are the backbone\nof the sea kingdom. We can provide you\nwith souls as before. Haven't&lt;unk&gt; you\nbecome a new follower of the sea god?\nCan't we continue as before? You still\nneed souls. Sumu frowned and said\nrighteously, \"How dare you? I have\nalready said that I am not a member of\nthe sea god's family. How dare you\nslander me. Guards, kill them all.\" With\na wave of his hand, an endless army of\nundead sea monsters surged out from\nbehind him like a tide surrounding\nPangyang and the others. Some of them\ncursed angrily while others knelt down\nand begged for mercy. But the only\nresponse they received was the roar of\nthe undead sirens. The wounded Pang Yang\nand his companions were no match for the\narmy of immortal sea monsters. They fled\nfrantically, but to no avail. Sea\nmonsters were everywhere, and the sea\nkingdom was an island nation. Escaping\nto the sea was tantamount to suicide, so\ntheir fate was already sealed. Haha. You\nbunch of bastards. You deserve to die.\nYou all deserve to die. Hujia laughed\nmaniacally. Have you laughed enough?\nIt's time for you to get going. Sumu's\ngentle voice rang in Hu Jia's ears like\na warm breeze in spring. Hu Jia's body\ntrembled and he laughed maniacally.\nSumu, you think you've won for sure?\nHuh? Being a follower of the sea god\nisn't so easy. From now on, you will\nlose your soul, lose all the joys of\nbeing human, and you will forever be\nlike me, a monster. Sumu smiled and\nreached out his palm to grasp a black\nfleshy beard behind Hu Jia. Come feel if\nmy soul is still there. Hujia's laughter\nfaltered. The moment his palm touched\nthe black fleshy beard, he felt the soul\nwithin Su Mu&lt;unk&gt;s body with crystal\nclarity. No, he roared in disbelief, his\nface filled with utter despair. Why?\nWhy? Before he could even ask a\nquestion, a flash of blue light\nappeared. And Huji had died in utter\ndespair. He died with his eyes wide open\nin disbelief. He had thought that Sumu\nwould suffer the same pain he had\nendured all these years and live on\nforever as a monster. But he found that\nSumu had already achieved the state he\nhad always dreamed of. After dealing\nwith Huia, Sumu turned to Muing and the\nothers and said, \"You guys can clean up\nthis mess. I have other things to do.\"\nAfter saying that, he disappeared into\nthe night. He randomly found a deserted\nplace, stopped, closed his eyes, and\nentered a dream. Having just used the\npower of the eternal celestial venerable\nto kill Hu Jia, the balance in his soul\nwas somewhat disrupted. Originally, the\neternal celestial venerable and the sea\ngod were in a stalemate. But Huia also\npossessed a small portion of the sea\ngod's power. Normally, this power would\nnot have affected the eternal celestial\nvenerable, but now it has become a key\nfactor in breaking the balance. In the\ndream, the sea god began to gain the\nupper hand, and more and more black\nfleshy tendrils extended out, constantly\nspreading towards the body of the\neternal heavenly venerable. Sumu's eyes\nflickered. He could not let the sea god\nwin because if the sea god won, his soul\nwould be taken away by the sea god, and\nhe would be completely reduced to a\nmonster like Hujia. Without a soul, it\nwould be the same as being dead.\nSuddenly, the silver mark between his\neyebrows cracked open, and a divine\nOnly gods can stand against gods, and\nthe primordial angels are his last trump\ncard. Whoosh! A dazzling holy light\nstruck the black fleshy tendrils,\ninstantly obliterating countless of\nthem. The celestial venerable of\nimmortality, who was initially at a\ndisadvantage, began to exert his\nstrength, extending billions of\nsemi-transparent tentacles to\ncounterattack the sea god. Sumu watched\nsilently from the side. Naturally, he\ncouldn't let the eternal heavenly\nvenerable win. The outcome would be the\nsame, death. For him, the best outcome\nwould be for both gods to suffer heavy\nlosses. The eternal celestial venerable\nwho held the upper hand continued to\nwear down the sea god's power. Two hours\nlater, whoosh! Another beam of holy\nlight struck the eternal celestial\nvenerable. Poseidon instantly rallied\nagain and began to exert its dominance\nin the opposite direction. Seeing this,\nSumu smiled silently. Gods are nothing\nmore than this. He continuously used the\npower of the primordial angels to\nmicromanage, trying his best to keep the\ntwo gods in a stalemate and continuously\ndeplete their divinity. This process was\nvery long, but he had no shortage of\npatience. Chapter 180. The master\ndisciple relationship breaks down. Sung\nXen walked through a dense forest and\nonto a winding blue stone path where a\nsecluded Tauist Temple soon came into\nview. It is the Chongqing Tauist Temple.\nStepping into the towist temple is like\nentering a tranquil world with only the\noccasional bird song echoing in the air.\nIn the courtyard, several ancient pines\nand cypresses stand proudly, their\nvigorous trunks seemingly telling the\nstory of time. Ah! A scream shattered\nthe peaceful atmosphere inside the\ntowist temple. Jun Wuang ran out of the\nmain hall, covering his head and fleeing\nin panic. Behind him was the old towist\nShianing, who was furious and holding a\nsword. You unfil disciple. I asked you\nto clean the statue of the celestial\nvenerable of longevity and you actually\nbroke it. Today I will punish you. Jun\nWuan cried out that he was innocent. It\nhas nothing to do with me. I just wiped\nit lightly and the statue just shattered\non its own. Nonsense. This statue has\nbeen worshiped by your master for many\nyears without any problems. How could it\nbreak as soon as you touch it? You unfil\ndisciple. How dare you argue? Take this\nsword from your master. The old Taoist\nSchwaning&lt;unk&gt;s eyes flashed and he\nshouted fiercely, but his attack was\nvery weak and powerless, and Jun Wuang\ndodged it several times. He knew, of\ncourse, that the statue wasn't broken by\nJun Wuang. Rather, it had broken when he\nlast met Sumu, and he had glued it back\ntogether. The reason he had Jun Wuang\nwipe it this time was, of course,\nintentional on his part. The usually\ncarefree Jun Wuang was genuinely\nterrified this time because he knew that\nthe statue of the eternal life celestial\nvenerable was his master's lifeblood. In\nthe past, no matter how much he\nmisbehaved, even if he pointed his\nfinger at his master and cursed him, his\nmaster would never truly get angry. But\nnow, finally, Jun Wuang was cornered by\nthe old tauist Shianing, and the\ngleaming sword was raised high, flashing\nwith cold light. Jun Wuang turned\ndeathly pale with fright, his eyes\nfilled with guilt. Master, that statue\nreally isn't. Shut up, you unfil\ndisciple. Even now, you still want to\nargue. Do you really think my precious\nsword is useless? Master Shinshing\nroared in fury. Feeling guilty, Jun\nWuang lowered his head. Master, I was\nwrong. I am willing to accept\npunishment. Seeing Jun Wuan&lt;unk&gt;s\nremorse, the old towist Shiin chuckled\ninwardly. He knew he had achieved his\ngoal. Ever since he learned that this\nkid's future achievements were\nlimitless, he had been thinking about\nhow to keep him in check. After all, the\nmess he had made in the past. Well,\nlet's not dwell on it. Today's\nperformance was a self-inflicted injury\nscheme that he had been racking his\nbrains for a long time. First, let this\nkid feel so ashamed he wants to\ndisappear. Then, I won't be able to\nbring myself to do it. I'll drop the\nsword, tears streaming down my face, and\nthe master and disciple will embrace and\nweep. Huh? Seeing that the time was\nright, the old tauist Shiqing brandished\nhis sword and Jun Wuang hurriedly\ncovered his head and dodged in panic. He\ndid not resist his master and in his\nheart he did not want to believe that\nhis master would kill him. As the sword\nwas about to fall, the old toist\nShinshing quietly released his grip,\nwaiting for the sword to land with a\nclang so he could begin his performance.\nTears were already welling up in his old\neyes. But just then, bang. A pebble flew\nthrough the air and knocked the sword\nout of Schwaning&lt;unk&gt;s hand. Master\nShinshing, spare his life. Sikong Xan\nwalked over from a distance. Shinshing,\nthe old Tauist, froze completely. He\nlooked at Sikong Xan, who was walking\nrapidly towards him, the sword that had\nfallen to the ground, and Jun Wu Shang,\nwhose expression was complicated. He was\ncompletely numb. Master, this is your\nonly disciple after all. He does not\ndeserve to die. Please show mercy. Sik\nKong Xan said solemnly. His idea was\nsimple. Shinqing Daist would definitely\nnot live long and Jun Wuang would\ninherit the mantle of the longevity\nDaist Temple sooner or later. If Jun\nWuang went to the capital in the future\nand was sought after by the nobles like\nShianing Daist, then he could say that\nhe was doing this in advance. It's just\na small favor, but it might earn me the\nfriendship of a future celebrity in the\ncapital. After all, it's a life-saving\nfavor. Master Shinshqing. With a\ncomplicated expression, Jun Wuang picked\nup the sword from the ground and placed\nit in Shinqing Daw&lt;unk&gt;s hand. Master, I\ndidn't expect you to really want to kill\nme because of this. Anyway, you saved my\nlife, so kill me if you want. Master\nShinshing, young brother, your master is\njust angry. How could he kill you? You\nshould leave first. I'll try to persuade\nhim later. Besides, I've come here with\nimportant business to discuss with your\nmaster. Sikong Xhin stood between the\ntwo and persuaded Jun Wuang to leave.\nFearing that Shianing, the old tauist,\nwould not let it go, he dragged and\npulled him into the main hall. Inside\nthe main hall, Sung Xan frowned. He\ndidn't understand why Master Shiing was\nlooking at him so strangely. Was it\nanger? Resentment? Master, please don't\nblame me. Your disciple has a good\ncharacter. It's all your fault. Master\nXian suddenly roared, his old face\nflushed red with anger. Who the hell\ntold you to meddle? Do you know how\nclose I almost? Master, calm down. He is\nyour only disciple. Even if you kill him\nin a fit of anger today, you will\ndefinitely regret it later. Wuang, who\nhad not gone far, heard Master Shining\nas furious voice and became even more\ndejected. He left Chongqing Tao's temple\nwithout saying a word, his figure for\nLauren. You want me to calm down? How\ncan I calm down? Huh? It's all ruined.\nYou've ruined everything. Who the hell\nis going to take care of me in my old\nage now? The distraught Daoist Shiing\nsquatted on the ground, repeatedly\npounding his chest and stamping his\nfeet. Sikong Xhan&lt;unk&gt;s brows furrowed\ndeeper and deeper. He had no intention\nof getting involved in the mess between\nthe master and disciple anymore and said\ndirectly, \"Dowist master, I have come\nhere today to ask for your help with an\nimportant matter. I've already reported\nyour deductions about the seven deadly\nsins to the royal family. They've given\nyou a strict order. You must deduce the\ntrue identities of the seven deadly\nsins. Even if you can't deduce pride,\nany one of the others will do. No, I'll\nhave to find another job. The dejected\nold tauist Shinshing refused without\neven thinking. Sikong narrowed his eyes\nslightly and calmly took out a small\nsquare box from his pocket. The royal\nfamily knows that your lifespan is\ncoming to an end, so they specially\nasked me to give you the three-leaf\nlongevity grass. Daist, you should know\nvery well that even the great nobles\ncovet this kind of precious\nextraordinary material. You can imagine\nthe royal family's determination to\ncapture the seven deadly sins.\nShinshing, the old tauists eyes\nflickered. He naturally knew the value\nof the threeleaf longevity grass. It was\na divine object that could prolong life.\nThe more leaves it had, the higher its\nvalue. The threeleaf longevity grass\ncould extend one's life by 3 years. He\nknew very well that he couldn't refuse\nthe royal family's offer of such a\ntreasure. It wasn't that he coveted the\nthreeleaf longevity grass, but rather\nthat refusing it would inevitably lead\nto his annihilation. So, he snatched the\nsmall square box from Seong Xan&lt;unk&gt;s\nhand, his old face revealing a greedy,\ncovetous look. You should have said so\nearlier if you had this treasure.\nChapter 1 181. Murang Yun&lt;unk&gt;s attack.\nSung Xan smiled faintly. Since the\nTauist priest has agreed, please begin\nthe ritual immediately. Not now. My\nwicked disciples smashed the statue of\nYou have to wait for me to repair the\nstatue first. Also, the effects of the\nthree-leaf longevity grass don't work\nimmediately after they appear. How about\nthis? Come back in 5 days. Sung Xan\nlooked displeased. Daist Master, I have\nalready said that the royal family takes\nthis matter very seriously. Master Xian\nglared and said, \"What's the use of\npaying attention? If I say 5 days, then\nit's 5 days. If I can't fully absorb the\nmedicine's effects, what if I run out of\nlifespan and die halfway through the\ncalculation? You don't want to be unable\nto calculate it, do you? In that case, I\nwill come again in 5 days. I hope you\nwill keep your promise, otherwise Seung\nXan did not finish his sentence, but the\nthreat was evident in his words. Okay.\nOkay. 5 days is 5 days. After Seong Xan\nleft, Daoist Shinshing looked at the\nthree-leaf longevity grass in the box\nand began to worry. He was thinking of a\nsolution, calculating it was definitely\nnot an option. Pride, the first of the\nseven deadly sins, was the messenger of\nthe eternal life celestial venerable and\nlust was that wicked disciple Jun Wuang.\nStrictly speaking, he was one of the\nseven deadly sins. The divine\nmessenger's creation of the seven deadly\nsins must have been at the behest of the\neternal heavenly venerable. As the\neternal heavenly venerables most devout\nfollower, he would never betray him,\neven at the cost of his life. He wanted\nto ask the divine messenger, Sumu, what\nto do, but Sumu had gone to the\nnightmare world and had not yet\nreturned, so he could only delay for the\ntime being. In one of the Mong family's\nprivate residences, Morong Yun was\nsmashing everything in the room.\nExpensive vases, porcelain pieces, and\npriceless artworks and sculptures were\nall thrown on the ground and smashed to\npieces. He vented for a while and\nfinally sat on the sofa with a gloomy\nface, picked up a bottle of wine, and\nfrantically poured it into his mouth.\n[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you lowly bastard. A\nworthless wretch born of a slave. How\ndare she? Bang! The wine bottle was\nsmashed to pieces. During this period,\nMorong Yun was extremely frustrated.\nSince Morongja&lt;unk&gt;s death, he had been\nactively fighting for the family\nproperty. He worked very hard every day,\ngetting up earlier than the chickens and\ngoing to bed later than the dogs. He was\nbusy building relationships and didn't\neven have much time to play with women.\nEven with all his efforts, the position\nof family head was getting further and\nfurther away from him. And the cause of\nall this was that damned illegitimate\ndaughter. Morongi Morongjha once said\nthat whoever finds the golden eye will\nbe the next heir of the Morong family.\nMong Moonly found the golden eye,\nalthough it was stolen by arrogance, but\nshe still found it. In addition, she\ndared to confront arrogance when\neveryone was afraid, thus saving some\nface for the Mong family. There are\ngrowing calls for her to be the\nsuccessor because she has the moral high\nground, especially the arrogant last\ncomment. I didn't expect the Mong family\nto be all useless. You have a lot of\ncourage. The comments from the gold\nlevel expert, especially since this gold\nlevel expert dared to defy the world and\nkill a nobleman in public and his\narrogant reputation soared also boosted\nMurong Mungly as prestige. There were\neven rumors circulating outside that the\nMurong family had no man and that only\nMurong Mungi, a woman, was carrying the\nbanner, a remarkable woman who survives\na great ordeal, confronting the empire's\ngreatest criminal, Arrogance. Rumors\nalso published various inspirational\nstories about Mur Mungley, such as her\nfather's dislike and her brother as\nbullying and her rise to power as an\nillegitimate daughter. Everyone else\ndoubted you, but you were the one who\nproved them wrong. Even more outrageous\nis the forbidden love. I fell in love\nwith the man who killed my father. No\nmatter how outrageous the news is, it's\nclear to anyone with eyes that Murong\nMungley has indeed become the most\nfavorable candidate to succeed the\nfamily head. Indeed, no one knows better\nthan Murong Yun how much of an advantage\nMurong Mungly currently possesses.\nBesides her reputation, Murong Mung also\ngained Seikong Jan&lt;unk&gt;s support because\nshe had already promised a portion of\nthe Murong family's assets to Seungjan.\nWhenever he thought of this, Murong Yin\ncouldn't help but fly into a rage. That\ndamn [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] She hadn't even become the\nhead of the family yet, and she had\nalready started selling off her family\nproperty. In fact, he had also\napproached Seong Xan in private and\nreluctantly promised him some of his\nfamily property, but the man didn't even\nlook at it. Later, he secretly inquired\nand found out that Murong Mungly s\nasking price was 10 times his. It can be\nsaid that Murang Mungley gave away\nalmost half of her family fortune in\norder to become the head of the family.\nHe couldn't do that. In fact, none of\nthese are the decisive factors. No\nmatter how high Murong Munley's\nreputation is or how much money she is\nwilling to spend, she still has a fatal\nweakness. She is not a superhuman. How\ncould an ordinary person compete with a\nsilver tier 2 superhum like myself? But\nthis weakness was eliminated today\nbecause Murang Mungley s bloodline\nawakened and she awakened the Murong\nfamily's silver law speed of wind and\nshadow leaping to become a silver tier 1\ntranscendent. This is also why Murang\nYun was so angry today. He couldn't\nunderstand why this damned bastard was\nso lucky, awakening his bloodline at the\ncrucial moment and making up for his\nlast weakness. Murang Yin knew perfectly\nwell that barring any unforeseen\ncircumstances, he was doomed.\nFortunately, an unexpected incident\nstill occurred. He sat on the sofa in\nsilence for a long time before finally\ndialing the phone. I agree to join you.\nA horse laugh came from the other end of\nthe phone. A smart choice. If Morona\nwere as smart as you, he would never\nhave died like this. After a long while,\na blood red figure appeared out of thin\nair in front of Murang Yun. The figure\nsolidified at a speed visible to the\nnaked eye, eventually transforming into\na handsome young man wearing a burgundy\nsuit. The man was also holding a glass\nof red wine, which contained a deep red\nliquid and emitted a pungent bloody\nsmell. He looked at the gloomy Murang\nYun, a wicked smile curling at the\ncorner of his mouth, and drank the blood\nin the cup in one gulp, a look of\nintoxication appearing on his pale face.\nIndeed, the blood of a virgin is the\nsweetest. Murang Yun raised his head,\nhis bloodshot eyes flashing with the\nmadness of someone who had reached the\nend of their road. \"Can you really help\nme become the head of the family?\" The\nman in the red suit scoffed. \"Is your\nambition just to be the head of a minor\nnoble family in this small town? With\nour help, you should broaden your\nhorizons and like your father, return to\nthe capital, to the center of power in\nthe Crimson Flame Empire. Stop spouting\nnonsense. Going to the capital is a\nmatter for the future. Right now, I just\nwant to know if I can become the head of\nthe family. The contempt in the man in\nthe red suit grew even stronger. Joining\nus will not only make you the head of\nthe family, but also grant you endless\nlifespan. You'll gradually understand\nhow weak humans are and that only\nvampires are the superior race. Murung\nYun sneered. You vampires from the Blood\nMoon Empire always boast about the\nsuperiority of your race. If you are\ntruly superior, then why is the world's\nnumber one empire the Dragon Abyss\nEmpire and not your Blood Moon Empire?\nChapter 182. Immortality and the body of\nimmortality. The man in the red suits\neyes flashed with murderous intent and\nthe glass in his hand shattered\ninstantly. The Blood Moon Empire will\neventually dominate the world and the\nDragon Abyss Empire will fall into our\nhands sooner or later, just like what\nyou did to the Crimson Flame Empire. If\nI'm not mistaken, quite a few nobles in\nthe Crimson Flame Empire have also been\ntransformed into vampires, haven't they?\nYou'll understand these things once you\njoin us. One last question. Why did my\nfather refuse you? Your father was\nindecisive. He wanted longevity, but\ndidn't want to be controlled by the\nvampires. So, he pinned his hopes on the\nGolden Eye. He originally planned to\njoin the vampires before his lifespan\nran out if he couldn't find the golden\neye. It was this hesitation that ruined\nhim. Otherwise, he wouldn't have died at\nthe hands of arrogance. Murong Yun gave\na cold smile. That's his style of doing\nthings, so I will never follow in his\nfootsteps. Come on. The man in the red\nsuit slowly opened his mouth, revealing\nsharp fangs, and bit down hard on Morong\nYun&lt;unk&gt;s neck. Murang Yun lost\nconsciousness due to the loss of a large\namount of blood. He woke up after an\nunknown amount of time, feeling an\nindescribable sense of ease and full of\nenergy. He got up from the ground only\nto find that the man in the red suit had\nalready disappeared, leaving behind only\na note that read, \"Congratulations on\njoining the great vampire clan. We will\nhelp you become the head of the Mong\nfamily. What you need to do is after\nbecoming the head of the family, try\nyour best to enter the power center of\nthe capital.\" Mong Yun tore the note to\nshreds. The gloom on her face was gone,\nreplaced by a confident air of complete\ncontrol. This feeling is really great.\nFather, I never expected that you would\nleave me such a good legacy after you\ndied. It is thanks to you that you did\nnot agree to the vampire clan that I was\ngiven this opportunity. Rest assured,\nunder my leadership, the Murong family\nwill regain its glory. It's just a pity\nthat by then the Murong family might no\nlonger be nobles of the Crimson Flame\nEmpire, but rather of the Blood Moon\nEmpire. But it doesn't matter. Being a\nnoble family anywhere is the same.\nSuddenly, his expression changed and he\nclutched his abdomen tightly. A strong\nfeeling of hunger surged through his\nbody and he couldn't help but want to\ndrink blood. This thought was so strong\nthat he even forgot his obsession with\nbeing the head of the family. He quickly\npicked up the phone and called over all\nthe women he kept. An hour later, the\nroom was filled with seven female\ncorpses. Their beautiful faces were\nfilled with disbelief and terror, and\nthere were two bloody holes in their\nnecks. They were lifeless. Morong Yun,\nhowever, did not care at all. Instead,\nhe leaned back on the sofa with a\nsatisfied look on his face. This feeling\nis really good. It's just that I didn't\ncontrol my strength while the first time\nand accidentally killed them all. It\nseems that I need to find a new batch of\nwomen. After feeling cooped up for\nseveral days, he felt relaxed and happy\nfor the first time. In a good mood, he\nturned on the record player and started\nlistening to music. A clear, ethereal\nfemale voice came from the record\nplayer, like a young girl in the throws\nof first love, slowly narrating her\nbeautiful expectations for the future\nand love. I look forward to a bright\nfuture, my dreams shining brightly in\nlike stars illuminating my heart. I look\nforward to the Holl's verdant green\nreflecting the light of time. I look\nforward to your expectations. This is a\nvery popular song in Chong Sha recently\nand it's also one that Murong Yun really\nlikes. Every time she hears this song,\nit's as if she can see a young girl in\nlove singing softly in front of her,\nsmiling gently. Song title, I'm looking\nforward to it. As the song ended, Mong\nYin slowly opened her eyes and smiled.\nI'm looking forward to it, too. By the\nway, the woman who sang this song seems\nto be from Chong Sha as well. The final\nmoment has finally arrived. In his\ndream, Sumu remarked that he had been in\nthe dream for three whole days. Apart\nfrom occasionally returning to reality\nto eat something and handle some affairs\nof the sea kingdom, he had been staying\nin the dream doing micromanagement.\nThanks to his tireless efforts, both the\ncelestial venerable of immortality and\nthe sea god have been severely injured.\nThe two towering giants in the dream had\nlong since disappeared, leaving only two\norbs of light, one green and one blue.\nThese two orbs of light seemed to be\nembedded together, constantly squeezing\ninto each other's bodies. As expected of\nthe divinity of gods, even when they\nwere about to perish, neither side\nstopped fighting. It was truly a fight\nto the death. The next moment, Sumu\narrived in front of the two orbs of\nlight, reached out, grabbed the orbs,\nand stuffed them directly into his body.\nHe wants to completely control the\ndivinity of the eternal heavenly\nvenerable and the sea god just as he\ncontrols the divinity of the primordial\nangels. He couldn't do those two divine\npowers before. But now that the snipe\nand the clam are fighting, the fisherman\nbenefits. As he devoured the two divine\nessences, a violent tearing sensation\ncame as if it were about to rip his soul\napart. However, as the silver vertical\npupil between his brows burst forth with\nsilver light, the tearing sensation was\nslowly suppressed, he used the divinity\nof the primordial angels to continuously\nmerge with them. And after a full day,\nhe finally completely digested the two\ndivine powers. At this point, Sumu\nalready possessed the divinity of three\ngods, the primordial angel, the eternal\nheavenly venerable, and the sea god.\nThese three divine qualities also\ngranted him three different abilities.\nThe primordial angel is the eye of God,\npossessing powerful annihilation\nabilities. The celestial venerable of\nimmortality has an interesting ability.\nHe waved his hand and a semi-transparent\ntentacle extended from his body, waving\nit around casually. This tentacle is not\naggressive, but it has the ability to\nextract lifespan. In other words, it can\nnow extract the lifespan of others to\nreplenish itself or bestow it upon\nothers. If used properly, the ability to\nextract lifespan is essentially\nequivalent to immortality. However, due\nto the limitations of his own life\nlevel, his body cannot store much\nlifespan. If he wants to live forever,\nhe can only extract the lifespan of\nothers every once in a while. Sumu had\nno interest in immortality. Endless life\nonly brought endless boredom. As soon as\nhe had a thought, the translucent\ntentacles suddenly turned black,\nsomewhat resembling a combination of the\nblack fleshy whiskers of the sea god and\nthe tentacles of the eternal heavenly\nvenerable. At this point, the tentacles\ncan extract not only lifespan but also\nsoul. After thinking for a while, Sumu\nfinally named it touch of God. Aside\nfrom the touch of God, the greatest gain\nwas the immortality that came with the\ndivinity of the sea god. True\nimmortality which even Mithil cannot\ncounter belongs to the realm of gods.\nHowever, due to his soul, although he\npossesses human perception, this is also\nthe greatest weakness of his\nimmortality. If he encounters a powerful\nsoul attack, he will still die. In\ncontrast, the immortal sirens do not\nhave this concern because their souls\nare in the hands of the sea god and\nunless the sea god is killed first,\ntheir souls are absolutely safe.\nOverall, the increase in combat power is\nnot significant, but the ability to\nsurvive is maximized as it is both\nimmortal and eternal. This also made\nSumu somewhat dissatisfied because he\nenjoyed the feeling of dancing on the\nedge of a knife and suddenly not being\nable to die really reduced some of the\nfun. Chapter 183. Dream Teleportation.\nMr. Su Muing knocked on the door, but\nthere was no response from inside the\nroom. She pushed open the door only to\nfind the room empty. Sumu was nowhere to\nbe seen. Muing looked puzzled. Where was\nMr. Su? Sumu had been sleeping in his\nroom these past few days, so why wasn't\nhe here today? From her unseen\nperspective, Sumu was standing in front\nof her, watching her with great\ninterest. Ms. Mu, he even called out to\nMuing, but Muing seemed not to hear him\nand did not react at all. Sumu walked up\nto Muing and reached out to touch her\nbody, but his hand passed straight\nthrough Muing's body. Upon seeing this,\nSumu couldn't help but smile slightly.\nInteresting. Is this the new ability of\ndreams? After absorbing divinity, he is\nexperimenting with new abilities of\ndreams. Just as his dreams became more\nand more real after he devoured the\ndivinity of the primordial angels, he\ncan forcibly pull the souls of ordinary\npeople into his dreams. Now that it has\ndevoured the divinity of the celestial\nvenerable of immortality and the sea\ngod, the dream's true nature has become\neven stronger. It can not only pull\npeople's souls into dreams, but also\ntheir physical bodies. This peculiar\ndream is increasingly resembling a real\nworld. The reason why Sumu disappeared\nin reality was because he had completely\nentered the dream world. Then he covered\nthe sea kingdom with the dream world,\nwhich created its current ghostly state.\nSimply put, under his control, dreams\nand reality completely overlap. He\nappears to walk freely in reality. But\nin reality, his true form is hidden in\nthe dream and will not be discovered by\nanyone. In my current dream state, it\nseems that I have no effect on reality.\nCompared to reality, I am a non-existent\nperson. Sumu's eyes flickered slightly.\nHe tried to activate his mental power to\npenetrate the boundary between dreams\nand reality. As expected, his mental\npower entered reality very smoothly.\nAfter all, this is his dream. He can now\neven pull his physical body into his\ndream. So, it's no problem for him to\nextend his spiritual power while in a\ndream. In an instant, many ideas about\nmanipulating dreams flashed through his\nmind. Suddenly, the endless demonic\nsound was activated. Miss Mu, what can I\ndo for you? Sumu's gentle voice echoed\nin the empty room. Muing was startled\nand quickly turned around only to find\nthat there was no one behind her. She\nwas quite surprised and kept scanning\nher surroundings with her beautiful\neyes, trying to find Su Mu&lt;unk&gt;s\nwhereabouts, but to no avail. Mr. Sue,\nwhere are you? I'm right next to you.\nMuching was even more surprised. She\neven reached out and touched around, but\nall she could touch was air. Mr. Su,\nwhat's going on? Why can't I see you?\nAre you invisible? I'm here. To Muing\nastonishment, Su Mu&lt;unk&gt;s figure\nappeared out of thin air before her\neyes. Mr. Su, I never imagined you could\nbecome invisible. Sumu smiled slightly.\nWhat do you need me for? Muing\nsuppressed her surprise and said\nfrankly, I'm going back to the real\nworld. I've had a vague feeling of\nreturning these past few days, so I came\nhere to say goodbye. Mr. Su, thanks to\nyou this time, I was able to break the\nsea god's curse in this dream.\nOtherwise, I might never have been able\nto go back. Sumu nodded, not at all\nsurprised, because Lu Dong had already\nreturned to reality yesterday.\nPreviously, this nightmare was shrouded\nin the power of the sea god. So, the\nnightmare apostles who entered could not\nreturn. But now that the power of the\nsea god has been consumed and devoured,\nthe shroud of this power has naturally\nbeen lifted. Mr. Sue, you probably\nalready know that my law is not natural\nbreath, but with spirit breath. I will\nno longer hide it. I will definitely\nrepay this life-saving grace. This is my\ncontact information. If you need any\nextraordinary potions in the future, you\ncan contact me at any time. Muching\nhanded over a small note and said with\nslight hesitation. To be honest, I have\nquite a few enemies in real life, so I\nmay change my contact information, but\nif conditions permit, I will contact you\nin advance before I change it. Sumu did\nnot take the note because his current\nbody was fake, a manifestation of the\nmyriad manifestations of the universe. I\ndon't need your contact information.\nI'll contact you when I need it. Muing\nwas takenback. She wanted to ask how the\nother party could contact her. But when\nshe thought of Sumu's previous amazing\nperformance, she suddenly felt that it\nshouldn't be too difficult for the other\nparty to contact her. So, she nodded in\nagreement. By the way, when you get\nback, prepare to refine the\nextraordinary potion of unending\nrecovery as your reward for this. I'll\ncome back to collect it from you once\nyou finished refining it.\" Muing nodded,\nabout to say something, but found that\nshe couldn't make a sound. She looked\ndown and saw that her body was gradually\nbecoming transparent, a sign of\nreturning to reality. She simply stopped\ntalking, waved at Sumu, and disappeared\ncompletely. of Muing, a humanoid\nrepository of extraordinary potions with\nexceptional potential. The reason he\ndidn't want her contact information was\nbecause he had better methods, that is\nto communicate through dreams. This is\nalso one of the new abilities of the\ndream world. It can build bridges with\nother dreams. No matter where Muing is,\nas long as she is still sleeping, Sumu\ncan contact her through the dream world.\nIt can even achieve dream teleportation\nusing one's own dream to invade\nanother's dream and then walk out of\nthat dream. For example, right now the\nsumu phantom in the room is shattering\ninch by inch. His true form in the dream\ninstantly appeared beside Yong Doning.\nAlthough he couldn't teleport in\nreality, in the dream he could not only\nteleport but also fly and disappear into\nthe ground. At this time, Yong Donging\nwas accumulating wealth. He discovered a\nlot of extraordinary materials plundered\nfrom the sea kingdom in Huia's treasure\ntrove. Although they were not\nparticularly rare, they were still\nextraordinary materials. In the real\nworld, they could be sold for at least\ntens or even hundreds of thousands of\ndollars. I don't know where he got a\nleather bag from, but his eyes lit up\nand he started stuffing things into it\nlike crazy. With so many extraordinary\nmaterials, imagine how many clothes I\ncould buy for Jasmine if I converted\nthem into money. Huh? Can't we buy\nsomething else? Sumu&lt;unk&gt;s voice\nsuddenly rang out from behind Yong\nDoning. Holy crap. Yong Donqing was\nstartled, almost dropping the animal\nskin bag he was holding. He turned\naround and yelled angrily. You walk so\nquietly. You almost scared me to death.\nSumu smiled slightly. He wasn't walking\nsilently. He wasn't walking at all. He\nused his dream to teleport to this place\nand then his real body stepped out of\nthe dream creating the effect of\nteleportation. However, this\nteleportation has a serious limitation.\nIt can only be done once. If he wants to\ncontinue teleporting now, he must first\nsleep, enter a dream state, and then\ncontrol the overlap between the dream\nand reality to teleport. Chapter 184.\nAll forces arrive at the door. Your bag\nis too small. It can't hold much at all.\nLet me do it. With that, Sumu took out a\nstorage treasure, a sheepkin bag, and to\nYong Donging&lt;unk&gt;s astonishment, put all\nthe extraordinary materials in the\nentire warehouse into his pocket. These\nextraordinary materials are mainly\ncomposed of seaweed, which is of average\nvalue and can be used to refine some\nwater-based extraordinary potions. Damn\nit, leave me some. I found this place\nfirst. Yang Dongqing was shouting when\nhe was suddenly surprised to find that\nhe couldn't make a sound. Then his body\nbegan to gradually become transparent.\nIs it time to return? Sumu eyes\nflickered slightly. He looked at himself\nand found that there was no change. This\nsurprised him. Could it be that those\nwho entered at the same time could not\nreturn at the same time? Or is it that\nyou are special and unable to return on\nyour own initiative? He didn't delve any\ndeeper because time was running out. If\nhe really couldn't return on his own, he\nwould be left in the sea kingdom once\nYong Dona left unless he found the\nsource of the nightmare in the sea\nkingdom and completely destroyed the\ndream. For him, the sea kingdom no\nlonger held any appeal and it was time\nto leave. Yong Donging, relax and don't\nresist. Although Yong Donging didn't\nknow what Sumu was going to do, she\nstill obediently did as he was told. A\ncrystallin blue light flashed in\nSumu&lt;unk&gt;s eyes, instantly hypnotizing\nYong Donging into sleep. Then he closed\nhis eyes and hypnotized himself to fall\nasleep. The next moment, Sumu appeared\nin the dream, disappearing from reality.\nHe invaded Yong Dong&lt;unk&gt;s dream with\nhis own dream. Soon, Yong Donging&lt;unk&gt;s\nbody became completely transparent and\ndisappeared into the sea kingdom.\nChongqing Tauist Temple. In a guest room\nto the side of the main hall, Yong\nDong&lt;unk&gt;s figure appeared out of thin\nair, lying straight on the floor, fast\nasleep. The air rippled like water as\nSumu slowly emerged from his dream.\nLooking around at his surroundings, he\nknew he had returned to reality. Bang!\nThe door to the room was flung open, and\nthe old towist Shiing rushed in\nexcitedly. Divine Envoy, I sense\nsomeone's presence just now and came\nover as quickly as possible. Seeing that\nyou are safe and sound, I am relieved.\nHuh? He shifted his gaze to Yong\nDonging, who was fast asleep on the\nground and asked in confusion, \"Divine\nEnvoy, who is he?\" Yong Donging, a\nmember of the bronze coffin team.\nShinqing, the old tauist, did not ask\nfor details. He seemed to remember\nsomething and hurriedly said, \"Divine\nEnvoy, I have something important to\nreport. Not long after you left,\nSeongjhan came again. He gave me a\nthreeleaf longevity grass to prolong my\nlife. He did this so that I could\ncalculate the seven deadly sins again.\nThis time, the royal family has given a\ndeath order that the seven deadly sins\nmust be found. I dare not make a\ndecision on my own. So, I deliberately\ndelayed for 5 days. Tomorrow will be the\nfifth day, and Sikong Xan will come to\nmy door then. Divine Envoy, what do you\nthink? Sumu became interested upon\nhearing this. It seems that the Crimson\nFlame royal family will not give up\nuntil they find the seven deadly sins.\nIn that case, let them find them. The\nold Tauist priest Shinshing was taken\nback. Divine Envoy, do you mean to?\nSu&lt;unk&gt;s gaze shifted, scrutinizing\nShinqing Daist from head to toe.\nShinqing felt a little uneasy under his\ngaze and gave a dry laugh. Divine envoy,\nwhy are you looking at me like that? The\ntowist priest said earlier that\nregardless of the loss of lifespan, one\ncould fight against a gold level expert.\nWas that true? Shinqing swallowed hard,\nfeeling that something bad was about to\nhappen. But he dared not deceive the\ndivine messenger and had to admit it\nwith a forced smile. That is indeed the\ncase, but I don't have many years left\nto live. Even if I eat the threeleaf\nlongevity grass, it will only increase\nmy lifespan by 3 years. If you want me\nto deal with Sikong Xan, I can deal with\nhim for a while. But if I want to win\nthe battle, this amount of lifespan is\nprobably not enough. Sumu smiled\nslightly, and with a gentle lift of his\narm, a semi-transparent tentacle emerged\nfrom his sleeve, emitting a faint blue\nlight, slowly revealing the supreme aura\nunique to the eternal celestial\nvenerable. Master Shining s face\nimmediately lit up with fervor as if he\nwere admiring the most beautiful work of\nart in the world, his eyes shining. This\nThis is the divine power of the\ncelestial venerable of longevity. That's\nright. I possess the divine power of the\ncelestial venerable of longevity and can\ncontrol my lifespan just like him. So,\nyou don't need to worry about the\nconsumption of your lifespan at all. I\nwill obey the orders of the divine\nmessenger. Master Schwaning&lt;unk&gt;s face\nshowed no more hesitation or worry, only\nfervor. Seeing Master Schwaning&lt;unk&gt;s\nreaction, Sumu's eyes shown with even\ngreater anticipation. It's time for the\nseven deadly sins to make their\nappearance. He turned and kicked Yong\nDona, waking him from his dream.\n\"Let's&lt;unk&gt; go back to the bronze coffin\nand see what kind of surprises these\npeople have prepared for me while I was\naway,\" Sumu said expectantly. \"I'm not\ngoing back to the bronze coffin. I'm\ngoing to find Jasmine,\" said Yong\nDoning, who was obsessed with love.\n\"Bonze coffin company.\" Sumu met Nang\nGong Mungly, whom he hadn't seen for\nmany days. Despite having avenged her\ngreat enemy, she still had a furrowed\nbrow as if she had encountered some\ndifficulty. However, when she saw Sumu\nreturned safely, her tightly furrowed\nbrows relaxed, and a smile returned to\nher beautiful face. She gently brushed a\nstray strand of hair from her cheek and\nsmiled sweetly, saying, \"Welcome back,\nSuzu. How was the nightmare world this\ntime? Did you encounter any danger?\"\nSumu nodded slightly and said calmly,\n\"There was no danger. I just died once.\nNang Gong Mingly was taken aback at\nfirst, then burst out laughing. You've\nbecome even more humorous these past few\ndays. Sumu smiled non-committally, but\nonly he knew that this so-called death\nwas not a joke, but a real death. After\na brief exchange of pleasantries,\nNangong Moonly solemnly closed the door\nand drew the curtains. The spacious\nCEO&lt;unk&gt;'s office suddenly became dim.\nSumu frowned slightly. Could it be that\nthey're having another child? Something\nhas happened,\" Nangong Moonly said\ngravely. Sumu&lt;unk&gt;s furrowed brows\nrelaxed. \"It's good that something\nhappened. If reality remained calm, he\ncould consider settling down in the\nnightmare world. Do you remember I said\nbefore that if I couldn't find the\ngolden eye, I would leave Star City? I\ndidn't tell you where I was going then.\nI remember, judging from your\nexpression, the trouble you mentioned is\nrelated to this matter.\" Nang Lingly s\nexpression grew increasingly solemn, her\nbrows furrowed with an unyielding\nfrustration. Actually, my plan at the\ntime was that if I couldn't find the\nGolden Eye, I would join the\nRevolutionary Army because I want\nrevenge. I want to deal with the nobles\nand only the Revolutionary Army can help\nme in the whole world. Sumu suddenly\nrealized. So, you contacted the\nRevolutionary Army in advance. But\nbecause I found the Golden Eye, it\ndisrupted your plan to join the\nRevolutionary Army. That's right. The\nRevolutionary Army has come knocking.\nChapter 185. It's time to let the seven\ndeadly sins resound throughout the\nworld. This doesn't seem like a bad\nthing. Isn't your ultimate goal to take\nrevenge on the royal family? With the\nhelp of the revolutionary army, you can\nachieve your goal faster. Sigh. Nangly\nsighed. That's what I thought at first,\ntoo. So, I met with the revolutionaries\nand told them that I would stay in\nShingqing and secretly help the\nrevolutionaries after I took control of\nthe Mong family. The revolutionary army\nagreed, but they made another demand.\nWhat are the requirements? Nang Gong\nWingly looked at Sumu Mu with an\ninscrable expression and slowly said,\n\"They want to see you.\" Su&lt;unk&gt;s eyes\nunderstood the subtext of those words.\n\"They want to see arrogance.\" \"That's\nright. They wanted to see arrogance, and\nthis is partly my fault,\" Nang Gong\nMungly said with some annoyance.\n\"Because I am a nobleman, it is\ndifficult for me to join the\nrevolutionary army. They were also\nafraid that I was a spy. So, I revealed\npart of my purpose, to kill Morona. I\ndidn't reveal that I was a descendant of\nan Angong family. Instead, I told them\nthat Murangua had killed my mother and\nthat I had witnessed too much darkness\nwithin the nobility. So, I wanted\nrevenge and to overthrow the nobility.\nHearing this, Sumu understood\ncompletely. Only the revolutionary army\nknew that your goal was to kill Muranga,\nand you had already made arrangements\nwith them to leave Shining and join them\nbefore the birthday banquet. In the end,\nnot only did you not leave, but Murunga\nwas also killed by Ao Man. Most\nimportantly, you stood up and questioned\nAo Man and Ao Man did not kill you. At\nthis point, he smiled and said, \"In this\nway, even a fool can see that you are\nrelated to arrogance. Otherwise, all of\nthis would be too much of a\ncoincidence.\" Nangong Mungly nodded with\na grim expression. \"That's right.\nAlthough I fooled the enforcement\nbureau, I couldn't fool the\nRevolutionary Army. They know my purpose\nand naturally guessed that I was acting\nwith arrogance at the banquet. So, they\nconcluded that I know arrogance.\" And\nthis time they made it clear that they\nwanted to see arrogance. If I disagree,\nthey will expose my secret contact with\nthe Revolutionary Army, ensuring my\ndemise. Haha. Sumu laughed even harder.\nNo wonder the Revolutionary Army was\nable to survive the siege of the Crimson\nFlame Empire. If they were just a bunch\nof naive and hot-lbed idealists who\nwanted to overthrow the nobles for\njustice, they wouldn't have survived\nthis long. Nang Mungly agreed\nwholeheartedly. It's normal for those\nwho achieve great things to be ruthless.\nIt's just that they used it on me. How\nmany of them came? One. Oh, this\narrogant person dares to come looking\nfor someone who is suspected to be a\ngold level expert all by himself. And\nwith Seong Xin currently in charge of\nStar City, it seems that this person is\nalso a gold level expert. The one who\nhas arrived is Yan Moxy, one of the\nthree deputy commanders of the\nRevolutionary Army, a gold level expert.\nUpon hearing this name, a clear look of\nfear flashed in Nang Gong Mong&lt;unk&gt;s\neyes. The words Golden Realm experts\npiqu Su Mu&lt;unk&gt;s interest. Sung Xan and\nYin Moxy, two Golden Realm experts are\nboth searching for arrogance. Things are\ngetting more and more interesting.\nEspecially Yin Moxy, he knows you're\nconnected to arrogance, yet he still\nthreatens you. This shows his goal isn't\nto recruit arrogance into the\nRevolutionary Army. Nang Gong Mun Le's\neyes. They won't let arrogance join the\nrevolutionary army. Why? Arrogance\nkilled the nobles. Haha. Sumu suddenly\nburst out laughing. So that's how it is.\nI didn't expect the revolutionary army\nto be so interesting. They have never\nkilled any nobles. Even when they\ncapture nobles, they only use them to\nexchange for ransom with the Crimson\nFlame Empire. They are afraid of\ntouching the Crimson Flame Empire's\nbottom line and provoking a crazy\ncounterattack from the Empire. Could\ntheir true purpose in forming a\nrevolutionary army be to gain amnesty? I\ndon't know about that. In their words,\nthe revolutionary army is still\nrelatively weak compared to the Crimson\nFlame Empire, and it's far from the\npoint of breaking ties with the Empire.\nAt present, the Crimson Flame Empire is\nbeset by internal and external troubles.\nThe Blood Moon Empire is eyeing it\ncovetously from the outside, and the\nvarious nobles within the Empire are not\nof one mind and are fighting each other.\nTherefore, the empire doesn't have much\npower to deal with the revolutionary\narmy. But once the revolutionary army\ncrosses the line, it will likely anger\nall the nobles, causing them to unite\nagainst the revolutionary army. A faint\nhint of sarcasm appeared on Nang Gong\nMly s lips. That's human nature. Sumu\nsmiled. For nobles, they don't care who\nbecomes emperor as long as they remain\nnobles. The revolutionary army\nunderstands this, so they dare not\noffend the nobles too much. Just like in\nancient times, the powerful families\nremained while the dynasties changed. In\nthe end, it was the commoners who died\nin the wars. No matter who came to\npower, they still had to rely on these\npowerful families. Let me guess, Yen\nMoxy's purpose in seeking out arrogance\nis quite obvious. He probably wants to\nuse the seven deadly sins to kill some\nnobles, throw the Crimson Flame Empire\ninto chaos, and incidentally draw fire\nfor the Revolutionary Army. What are\nyour plans? Nang Mungly asked worriedly.\nOnly she and Sumu knew best that the\nso-called seven deadly sins was just an\nempty shell. It was not the organization\ncomposed of seven vicious gold level\nexperts as rumored. Even the leader of\nthe seven deadly sins, pride was only a\nbronze level transcendent. Of course, we\nmust see them. And not only that, we\nmust see them openly and honestly,\nwhether it's Seong Xan or Yin Moxy,\nsince they are sincerely visiting, how\ncan the seven deadly sins be negligent?\nGradually, a grand plan emerged in Su\nMu&lt;unk&gt;s mind. It was time to let the\nname of the seven deadly sins resound\nthroughout the world. In a quiet villa\nin the downtown area, Yong Doning stood\nup in front of the door, holding a\nbouquet of Jasmine flowers. Jasmine, I'm\nback. Thump, thump, thump. He knocked\nhard on the villa door. This villa was\nbought by him and Jasmine together.\nAfter joining the bronze coffin, he made\nsome money and Jasmine also earned a\ngood income by releasing records. So,\nthe two of them bought a villa to live\nin. Bidding farewell to their old\ndilapidated bungalow. Outperforming\nagain, Yong Donging scratched his head.\nHis phone and keys had long been lost in\nthe sea in the land of the sea. So, he\ncouldn't get into his house at all. He\nglanced at the expensive gate, then\nhesitated to break it down. So, he\nsimply ran to a public phone booth and\ncalled Jasmine. Beep beep beep. The\nnumber you dialed is currently switched\noff. Please try again later. No one's\nanswering. Looks like she's really\nperforming. Let's go to Jasmine's\ncompany and wait. She'll definitely go\nback to the company after her\nperformance. Yong Doning hailed a taxi\nand headed straight for Jasmine's\ncompany. The roads in the lower district\nare congested and narrow and have been\nin disrepair for years. Many places are\nfull of potholes. In the taxi, Yong\nDonging&lt;unk&gt;s body bounced up and down\nwith the vehicle's bumps. The jasmine\nflower in his hand was the same. Its\npetals were somewhat deformed from being\nshaken around. Driver, slow down. My\nflowers are going to rot. Amidst Yong\nDona&lt;unk&gt;s complaints, a delicate\nJasmine petal silently drifted down.\nChapter 186. The vanished Jasmine. Soon,\nYong Doning arrived at the company where\nJasmine worked, Dreamchasing Media\nCompany Limited, which was actually\ncontrolled by Sumu and belonged to one\nof the companies under the poisonous\nsnake gang. At the time, Sumu wanted to\nbetter control Yong Donging. And since\nJasmine's dream was to hold concerts and\nbecome a singer, he arranged for Jasmine\nto join this company. Jasmine certainly\nhas the talent to make a living in this\nindustry. She is outstanding in both\nappearance and voice. With her beauty\nand sweet voice, she made her official\ndebut with the song I look forward not\nlong after. Although she is not a big\nstar, she is at least quite famous\nlocally and Shingqing. I occasionally\nparticipate in commercial performances\nwhich has helped the company earn a lot\nof money. Yong Dongqing walked into the\ncompany building with ease. This was not\nhis first time here. He used to come\nhere almost every day to see Jasmine.\nEveryone in the company knows that he is\nJasmine's boyfriend. Hey Lai, where's\nJasmine? Yong Doning called out to\nJasmine's agent as he hurriedly ran\nthrough the company corridor. The agent\nnamed Lai looked up and saw Yong Doning.\nHis face immediately showed anxiety. Mr.\nYong, you finally arrived. Something\nterrible has happened. Yong\nDonging&lt;unk&gt;s expression changed\nslightly. What happened? Is it related\nto Jasmine? Jasmine has been missing for\n3 days. What? Yong Don&lt;unk&gt;s expression\nchanged drastically. The Jasmine flowers\nslipped from his hand and scattered on\nthe ground. He asked anxiously, \"What\nhappened? Why did Jasmine disappear?\"\nOldie was also sweating profusely with\nanxiety, sighing and saying, \"I don't\nknow either.\" 3 days ago, Jasmine\nfinished a commercial performance and\nwent backstage to change clothes and\nthen she just disappeared. I searched\neverywhere but couldn't find her. Later,\nI reported it directly to the law\nenforcement bureau and now the law\nenforcement bureau is also looking for\nher, but there has been no news for a\nlong time. Yang Donging&lt;unk&gt;s breath\nhitched as if a large hand was gripping\nhis neck, making it hard to breathe. His\nheart pounded wildly, and an ominous\npremonition surged into his heart. Then\nwhat are you still standing here for?\nHurry up and go find it. He roared with\nbloodshot eyes, unleashing the aura of a\nsuperhum, which terrified old Lee. Yes,\nyes, I'll go find it right away. With\nher heart pounding, Yong Donging also\nrushed out of the company. Jasmine,\nplease don't let anything happen to you.\nHe wandered around the main road like a\nheadless fly, attracting the attention\nand whispers of passers by. After\nrunning for a while, Yong Doning stopped\nbecause he had no idea which direction\nto look in. Calm down. Calm down. Think\ncarefully about what to do. Sumu. That's\nright. Sumu is the leader of the Viper\ngang. He has so many men under him. He\nmust be able to find Jasmine. He ran\nfrantically toward the nearest phone\nbooth, his hands trembling with anxiety\nas he dialed the number repeatedly.\nAfter several incorrect attempts, he\nfinally got through. Hello. Sumu's\ngentle voice came from the other end of\nthe phone. \"Jasmine is missing,\" Yong\nDonging shouted anxiously. \"The people\nat the company said she's been missing\nfor 3 days.\" \"Sumu, please help me find\nher quickly. You must find her. Wait for\nmy message.\" Sumu&lt;unk&gt;s voice remained\ngentle on the phone. For some reason,\nhearing that familiar voice calmed Yong\nDong&lt;unk&gt;s anxious heart a little.\nWhat's wrong? Nangongly looked at Su Mu\nin surprise. Yong Donging sounds very\nanxious. Jasmine is missing. Nangong\nMunley frowned and asked, \"Is it the\nlittle girl I'm looking forward to\nsinging?\" Sumu nodded. Jasmine is just\nan ordinary person. The only thing\nthat's not ordinary about her is that\nshe has a superhuman boyfriend. I\nsuspect that someone is coming for the\nbronze coffin. After all, Yong Donging\nis an employee of the Bronze Coffin.\nI'll go out for a bit. With Su Mu&lt;unk&gt;s\ndeparture, a vast intelligence network\ncovering Star City was instantly\nactivated. He was an idol during his\ntime with the Bronze Coffin. As the head\nof the intelligence department, how\ncould he function without an\nintelligence network? So, he often used\nhis spare time to randomly hypnotize\nsome lucky viewers. Currently, his\nintelligence network has spread across\nmost of Star City with people in both\nthe upper and lower districts. Several\nhours later, Sumu's intelligence network\nreported that the last place Jasmine was\nseen was a commercial performance venue\nin the upper city district. Surveillance\nfootage showed that Jasmine went\nbackstage and never came out again.\nDuring the period when Jasmine\ndisappeared, a total of 127 vehicles\nleft the scene. After checking the\nownership of the vehicles, it was found\nthat the departing vehicles included the\nCEO of Shinghao Chamber of Commerce, a\ndirector of Chuing Film and Television,\nand a reporter from Shining Radio. Sumu\nlooked at the long list in his hand, and\nfinally his eyes settled on the three\nwords, Murong family. There was a black\nminivan at the scene that was registered\nunder the Mong family's name. His eyes\nflickered slightly as he sensed\nsomething strange. First of all, only a\nfew directors of major business\nassociations and nobles in the entire\nStar City could have managed to abduct\nJasmine at a commercial performance\nwithout anyone noticing and without the\nintelligence network's knowledge. Shing\nis not home to only the Mong family, but\nthe Mong family is the most powerful\nnoble family in the area. Some lesser\nnoble families have not even a single\nbloodline awakener and rely entirely on\nthe legacy of their ancestors to\nsurvive. The reason for suspecting the\nMong family is that at this time the\nMong family's children should not have\nthe leisure to come and watch commercial\nperformances. Monga has only been dead\nfor a short time. Instead of being busy\nwith funeral arrangements and fighting\nfor the family property, they are\nstarting to entertain themselves. And if\nanyone really wants to target the bronze\ncoffin, it will definitely be one of the\nMurong family's children since Nang Gong\nMingly is currently very popular and is\nseen as a thorn in the side by all her\nbrothers and sisters. Sumu judged that\nthis was most likely done by someone\nfrom the Mong family, but he didn't know\nwhich member of the Morong family it\nwas. The Mong family owns many\nproperties and nobles value privacy\nhighly. The intelligence network he\ncasually set up is currently not capable\nof investigating nobles. The only thing\nthat puzzled him was why they would\ntarget Jasmine. Were they really so\nnaive as to think they could use Jasmine\nto threaten Yong Doning and then bring\ndown Nangly? Nangong Mungley's public\npersona is that of a silver tier 1\ntranscendent who has awakened the speed\nof wind shadow. In reality, however,\nNangong Mungly found a treasure that can\ncontrol wind and then used it to add a\nlittle wind effect to herself when using\nflower blooming moment. In their minds,\nYong Doning was only at the first level\nof bronze, and the gap between them was\ntoo great. Even a sneak attack could not\nmake up for it. If the goal was to\ngather information about the bronze\ncoffin, then it was even less\nappropriate to approach Yong Doning.\nThose involved in the actual work were\njust ordinary employees. Most\nimportantly, if you want to turn Yong\nDoning against his will, you should at\nleast do it secretly, right? What's the\npoint of kidnapping Jasmine for 3 days\nstraight and making it known to\neveryone? Even someone as intelligent as\nSu Moo sometimes cannot anticipate such\nsudden situations arising from a whim.\nChapter 187. Another gold rank\npowerhouse. Bang. The office doors\nsuddenly opened and Yong Donging rushed\nin, his face full of anxiety. Any news?\nOne thing is certain. This matter is\nrelated to several of the Murong\nfamily's children. The Murong family.\nI'm going to find them right now. Yong\nDoning was furious upon hearing this and\nimmediately tried to rush out the door,\nbut Sumu stopped him. The Mong family's\nbusinesses are all over Shing. Do you\nknow where they've hidden their people?\nIf you go there rashly now, you'll only\nalert them. What should we do? Am I just\nsupposed to stand here and wait? Jasmine\nhas been missing for 3 days. What if\nsomething happens to her? Don't worry, I\nhave a way to find Jasmine. What method?\nEntering a dream. At night, Sumu lay in\nbed and fell asleep. He waited until\nvery late to make sure that Jasmine was\nasleep. After entering the dream, he\nbegan to perceive Jasmine's dream. Soon,\nin the vast and boundless dream, a star\nrepresenting Jasmine appeared. \"Found\nit,\" Sumu murmured to himself, gazing at\nthe star. The next moment, the dream\nextended and surged into the star,\ntaking him into Jasmine's dream as well.\n\"This is a nightmare.\" Har can't\nsuppress your thirst for blood anymore.\nI love watching a stubborn girl like you\nfall into depravity. I don't like\nforcing people, so if you spend one\nnight with me, I'll give you blood. How\nabout it? In the prison-like room,\nMurang Yun laughed wildly, his eyes\nflashing with an eerie scarlet light. He\nseemed to have changed, his skin was as\npale as paper, and two sharp fangs\ngleamed coldly at the corners of his\nmouth, growing from her bloodless lips.\nNo, I don't want blood. Take it away.\nJasmine struggled in terror, but she\ncouldn't break free from Murong\nYan&lt;unk&gt;s control. Suddenly, a child\nappeared in Morong Yan&lt;unk&gt;s hand. He\ngrabbed the child by the neck and held\nthe child to Jasmine's mouth. You can't\nresist this instinctive temptation.\nYou've been turned into a vampire by me.\nAccept reality. Huh? With a scream from\nJasmine, the surrounding scenery changed\nrapidly. This time it was a manor and\nshe was shackled and tied to a huge\nstage singing I expect crying as she\nsang. Meanwhile, Murong Yun sitting in\nthe audience looked satisfied. It really\ndoes feel better to hear a live singer\nsing. The scene changes again, this time\nto Jasmine and Yong Doning&lt;unk&gt;s home.\nThe two embrace tightly, but the next\nmoment, Jasmine sprouted sharp teeth\nfrom the corners of her mouth and bit\ndown hard on Yong Doning&lt;unk&gt;s neck.\nYong Doning is dead. Jasmine, like a\nchild who has done something wrong,\nholds Yong Dongqing&lt;unk&gt;s body and cries\nbitterly. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.\nUpon seeing this, Su Mu frowns slightly.\nA vampire. Dreams are a manifestation of\nthe subconscious mind and are usually\nchaotic, especially nightmares, but they\nreflect reality to some extent. He tried\nto guide Jasmine's dreams to reveal what\nhad actually happened in those three\ndays. A moment later, countless images\nflash before his eyes, and he finally\nunderstood the cause and course of\nevents. The reason is actually because\nof Jasmine's song. I'm looking forward\nto it. In this era of aristocratic rule,\nfame was sometimes not a good thing.\nJasmine, whom I was hoping to become\nfamous, was targeted by Murong Yun\nsimply because he liked the song and\nJasmine's voice. Such things are common\namong nobles, but this time it happened\nto Jasmine. Then Murong Yun kidnapped\nJasmine and imprisoned her. He was\ndisgusted by the women in the upper city\nwho were eager to please him. But\nJasmine, a commoner from the lower city,\nwho didn't care about her noble status\nat all, gave him a different feeling. At\nfirst, he tried to coersse and entice\nJasmine, hoping to see her cry and give\nin, but he failed. So, he devised a plan\nto turn Jasmine into a vampire and force\nher to drink blood. Vampires who have\ndrunk blood cannot resist that\ntemptation, and Mury&lt;unk&gt;s goal was to\nwatch her fall into depravity. Sumu's\neyes flickered slightly. He extended his\nown dream, spreading it outwards like an\nunfolding domain. After breaking through\nJasmine's dream, he saw the real\nenvironment in which Jasmine herself\nwas. In a dimly lit room, there were\nmany dried blood stains on the floor,\nthe marks still very fresh. Jasmine was\nimprisoned in an iron cage, fast asleep\nwith tears streaming down her face. Sumu\ndid not wake Jasmine, but walked out of\nthe room. In his dream, he completely\nignored the heavy iron door in front of\nhim and walked straight through it. He\nmoved through the house like a ghost\nwithout interacting with the real world\nat all. A moment later, he entered the\nroom on the top floor and met Murong Yun\nand a man in a dark red suit. Lord Blood\nAbyss, I have successfully gained\ncontrol of the Blood Clan's power these\npast few days and can begin to eliminate\nthe other heirs of the Morong family.\nHowever, I am not entirely confident in\ndealing with Morong Mly. Murong Yun said\nwith a troubled expression. Shu Yuan\nsneered. Morong Yun, I really\noverestimated you. As a silver too and\npossessing the power of the blood clan,\nyou can't even handle a silvery woman.\nSuppression among vampires prevented him\nfrom refuting it. He could only explain,\n\"No, Lord Blood Abyss, that woman Murong\nMungly is extremely wicked. In fact,\nbefore I became a vampire, I secretly\ndealt with her once using a silver tier\nthird order treasure with ranged attack\ncapabilities. But this woman's wine\nshadow speed is just too fast. Despite\nbeing a silver rank one, she managed to\ndodge that noble fantasm s attack. I\neven suspect her speed is almost\ncomparable to Murangas. I can defeat her\neasily, but killing her would be very\ndifficult. So, I can only trouble you to\ntake action. You are a gold level\nexpert. Killing [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Mungly would be a\npiece of cake. Useless trash. Shu Yuan\nsneered. If you had spent less time on\nwomen, you wouldn't be so bad at this.\nYou've only been a vampire for a short\ntime, and you dare to give someone your\nfirst embrace? Do you know how much\nblood you need to drink to replenish it\nafter one embrace? Mong Yun was\nimmediately filled with fear. You knew\neverything. With my senses, I could\ndetect even a fly in this villa, let\nalone the fact that you've hidden a\nwoman. Blood Abyss spoke with great\npride in his vampire senses. Standing\nbeside him, Sumu nodded approvingly. It\nseems that even a gold level expert is\nnothing special. To test the other\nparty's perception, he deliberately\nslapped Shu Yuan across the face, his\npalm passing right through Shu\nYuan&lt;unk&gt;s face. Yet, the other party\nremained arrogant and completely\nunaware. Didn't you bribe Morong Mungly\nas secretary? Go and find out where she\nfrequents. Then tell me, and I'll take\naction. With that, Shu Yuan turned and\nleft. Watch Yuan's departing figure\nthoughtfully. Another gold level expert.\nIn such a small star city, more and more\ngold level experts are coming.\nUltimately, it all stems from the seven\ndeadly sins. That damn [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] She made\nme get scolded by Lord Blood Abyss.\nMurang Yun said with a gloomy face and\nnaturally attributed the blame to\nJasmine. He turned and walked\ndownstairs, arriving at the door of the\nroom where Jasmine was imprisoned. A\ncold smile appeared on his lips. This\n[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hasn't drunk blood for a day. She\nprobably can't suppress her physical\ninstincts anymore. I want to see if she\nl submit obediently in this state.\nChapter 188. Jasmine's return. Just as\nMurong Yun was about to open the door to\nthe room where Jasmine was imprisoned, a\ndull thud suddenly came from the villa's\nmain gate. There was a loud thud, as if\nsomething was banging on the door. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\nYan&lt;unk&gt;s expression immediately changed\nslightly. This was his private villa,\nwhich was very secluded. How could\nsomeone be knocking on the door so late\nat night? He released his grip on the\ndoororknob and walked towards the\nvilla's main entrance with a ghostly\nfigure. He listened cautiously at the\ndoor, but there was no further sound\noutside. After a slight hesitation,\nMurong Yun suddenly opened the door. The\noutside was empty with nothing but the\nlawn outside the villa. His face\ndarkened with his level of strength. How\ncould he possibly be hallucinating? The\ndoor must have been knocked just now.\nJust as he was about to search, he\ncaught a glimpse of a low clump of grass\nswaying slightly out of the corner of\nhis eye. The next moment, an orange cat\npoked its head out, its vertical pupils\ngleaming with emerald light, giving\nMurong Yun a cautious look before it ran\naway. Murong Yun frowned slightly. Is it\na cat? He closed the door and walked\nback towards the room where Jasmine was\nimprisoned. What he didn't know was that\nJasmine was gradually disappearing, her\nbody becoming transparent little by\nlittle until she finally vanished\ncompletely. Jasmine was pulled into a\ndream by Sumu. Since absorbing more\ndivinity, the dream has become\nincreasingly similar to the real world\nand can now initially support the matter\nof the real world. For example, people.\nHowever, this ability to pull people\ninto dreams is limited. Dreams have\nlimited capacity and cannot carry a\nlarge amount of real world matter.\nIdeally, the object should be inanimate\nbecause inanimate objects do not move or\nresist. If a living creature enters the\ndream and struggles violently in the\ndream, it will affect the stability of\nthe dream and cause the dream to\ncollapse. Ordinary people are fine, but\nif a superhuman enters the dream and\ncauses trouble inside, the dream will\ninevitably collapse. Moreover, the more\npowerful the superhuman, the stronger\ntheir own power and the greater the\ndamage they will cause to the dream.\nTherefore, this ability is not very\noffensive at present and can only\nattract ordinary people or superhumans\nwho voluntarily enter without any\nresistance. Jasmine has now become a\nvampire, transcending the realm of\nordinary people. However, she is in a\ncoma and therefore does not resist. She\nwas easily pulled into a dream by Sumu\nand taken away. Click. The door was\nopened by Mur Yun, his eyes gleaming\nwith excitement. Little wild cat, can't\nyou hold back any longer? As long as you\nobediently submit. Isle. Murang Yun\nstopped mid-sentence as if she had a\nchoke point, her eyes fixed on the empty\nroom. Where did they go? He searched the\nroom frantically, overturning all the\nclutter and cabinets. But Jasmine was\nnowhere to be found. Undeterred, he\nactivated speed of wind shadow, his\nfigure instantly sweeping across the\nentire villa like a gentle breeze. No,\nnot anywhere. Jasmine vanished into thin\nair as if she had evaporated into thin\nair. In his rage, Mong Yun was\noverwhelmed by a chilling feeling.\nJasmine could not have escaped on her\nown. Having just become a vampire and\nnot having eaten for a long time, she\ncertainly wouldn't have had the strength\nto run away. This means that someone\njust came to my villa and took Jasmine\naway without me noticing. How is this\npossible? Murang Yan&lt;unk&gt;s face was full\nof disbelief. He knew that Lord Shu Yuan\nhad only left recently. When did that\nperson arrive? How could he have escaped\nLord Shuan s notice? Shu Yuan is a gold\nlevel expert. Anyone who can deceive his\nsenses must also be a gold level expert.\nBut why would a gold level expert come\nand take Jasmine away? Unless he\nconsidered one possibility, and his\nexpression suddenly turned grim. Unless\nit was Lord Blood Abyss who did it. The\nmoment the thought crossed his mind, it\nspread like a plague. Just now, Lord\nBlood Abyss had clearly expressed his\ndissatisfaction with him turning Jasmine\ninto a vampire, and only Lord Blood\nAbyss knew that Jasmine was being held\ncaptive in this villa. Could it be that\nLord Blood Abyss deliberately took\nJasmine away to give him a warning?\n\"Damn it!\" Morong Yun roared in fury,\nbut he dared not go to Shu Yuan to\nconfirm. His actions had already\ndispleased the other party, and if he\nwere to ask further questions now, he\nwould be in even more trouble. He knew\nthat he was not irreplaceable to Shuan\nbecause the Mong family had other\nchildren. The reason they chose him was\nsimply because he was the strongest, a\nsilver too, while the other children\nwere all silvery. Moreover, he was the\neldest son and the rightful heir. You\nare the best choice, not the only choice\nin the Shaing District at Yong Donging\nand Jasmine's home. At this moment, Yong\nDonging sat on the sofa with bloodshot\neyes and a near collapsed expression,\nhis hands clenched tightly between his\nhair. Jasmine, where did you go? Please\ndon't let anything happen to you. She's\nall right. Sumu&lt;unk&gt;s voice suddenly\ncame from the second floor. Tong Yang\nDonging suddenly stood up and saw that\nSumu had already appeared on the second\nfloor stairs. He didn't even have time\nto wonder how Sumu had appeared and\nrushed to Sumu in three steps. Found\nJasmine. Sumu nodded, gesturing with his\neyes that Jasmine was in the bedroom on\nthe second floor. Yong Donging&lt;unk&gt;s\nnear collapse expression instantly\nturned into wild joy and he rushed\nstraight to the bedroom on the second\nfloor. Bang! The door was flung open and\nhe saw Jasmine lying on the bed, her\nskin unusually pale. It was this loud\nbanging of the door that woke Jasmine\nfrom her deep sleep. Jasmine seemed to\nwake from a nightmare. Her face streaked\nwith tears and her expression terrified.\nHer slender, pale arms flailed wildly.\n\"No, no, I don't want blood.\" Yong\nDong&lt;unk&gt;s heart was breaking. He rushed\nto the window, grabbed Jasmine's\nflailing hands, and cried out with red\neyes, \"It's me, Jasmine. It's me.\" As if\nwaking from a dream, Jasmine looked at\nYong Doning. She was stunned for a\nmoment, her eyes widening in disbelief,\nand then tears welled up in her eyes.\nShe trembled as she reached out to touch\nYong Doning&lt;unk&gt;s face. \"Holly, is it\nreally you? Am I dreaming? You're not\ndreaming. It's me. It's me. Are you all\nright, Jasmine? Where have you been\nthese past few days?\" Yong Donging held\nJasmine's small hand tightly and pressed\nit against his cheek. The touch was icy\ncold without any body temperature, like\nholding the hand of a corpse. He felt\nincreasingly distressed. How did I get\nhere? Wasn't I? Jasmine stammered. Sumu\nbrought you back. You were missing and\nhe just found you and brought you back.\nWhat happened, Jasmine? Did someone\nkidnap you? Who is that person? Tell me\nand I'll kill him. Yong Donging almost\nground his teeth to powder, his soaring\nanger almost overflowing from his chest.\nChapter 189. Bloodthirsty Jasmine. I\nJasmine opened her mouth, but her\nexpression suddenly turned terrified,\nand she quickly stopped herself with\ntears in her eyes. She said, \"Doning,\ndon't ask anymore. We can't afford to\noffend him. Don't go. You&lt;unk&gt;ll die.\"\nEnraged, Yong Doning felt Jasmine\ntrembling and grew even more furious.\nWho is that person? Even if I die, I\nwill kill him. No, no, no. I don't want\nyou to die. Please, please stop asking.\nOkay. Jasmine was terrified again and\ncouldn't stop crying. She had been\nhaving nightmares about Yong Doning\nbeing killed several times in the past\nfew days. In her mind, Morung Yun was a\nnobleman, and nobles were the heavens of\nthe Crimson Flame Empire. Ordinary\npeople who offended nobles were doomed,\nand even extraordinary individuals were\nno exception. This deeply ingrained\nconcept of hierarchy had long been\nfirmly rooted in the hearts of every\ncitizen of the Crimson Flame Empire.\nYong Donging hugged Jasmine tightly,\ncomforting her. I won't ask anymore.\nDon't cry, Jasmine. Everything is all\nright now. I'm here. I won't let anyone\nhurt you. Jasmine felt Yong\nDonging&lt;unk&gt;s long-awaited embrace. She\nrested her head on his shoulder, and\nsoon that spot was wet with tears.\nJasmine, why are you so cold? Did you\ncatch a chill? You've also lost weight.\nLet me make you a bowl of hot noodle\nsoup. You must be starving. Yong\nDongqing gently comforted her, but the\nanger in his heart not only did not\nsubside, but instead intensified due to\nthe temporary suppression. He did not\nwant Jasmine to worry. So, he planned to\nask Sumu while he was cooking noodles.\nSince Sumu was the one who rescued\nJasmine, he must know who kidnapped her.\nWhat he didn't notice was that the words\nstarving seemed to remind Jasmine of her\njoy at their reunion, and the instincts\nhidden in her body were frantically\nstimulated by hunger. Standing at the\ndoorway, Sumu calmly looked at Jasmine.\nHis pale and eerie face was reflected in\nhis brown tinted glasses, and two sharp\nfangs slowly emerged from Jasmine's\nmouth. Jasmine's eyes changed as well,\nas if she had lost her humanity in an\ninstant, her eyes filled with a\nbloodthirsty beast. Clang. A metallic\nclang rang out against Yong\nDonging&lt;unk&gt;s neck, his sharp teeth\nblocked by his steel-like skin, even\nfaintly sparking from the friction.\nJasmine Yu. Yong Donging was stunned. He\nhad no idea what Jasmine was doing. The\nnext moment, her steel-like skin was\nfinally pierced, and her sharp teeth\nfell into her flesh. His blood seemed to\nflow uncontrollably, rushing wildly\ntowards the pierced wound. Jasmine\nsucked deeply, a look of satisfaction\nflashing across her bewitching face, her\nbloodthirsty gleam intensifying. In\npain, quickly pushed Jasmine away. When\nhe saw Jasmine's current state, he was\nshocked. \"Jasmine, what's wrong with\nyour teeth?\" Before he could finish\nspeaking, Jasmine, with her limbs\ntogether on the bed, glared fiercely and\ninstantly leaped into the air like a\nvicious dog pouncing on its prey, biting\nhard at Yong Doning&lt;unk&gt;s neck. Although\nYong Doning was panicked, he was\nultimately a second tier bronze level\nsuperhuman and quickly pinned Jasmine\ndown on the bed. Jasmine struggled\nviolently, screaming repeatedly, her\nbeautiful lips stained crimson with\nblood. Blood! Give me blood. Jasmine,\ncalm down. \"What's wrong with you? It's\nme, Yong Doning.\" Yong Donging shouted\nanxiously, his eyes filled with worry\nand heartache. Perhaps it was the name\nYong Donging that awakened Jasmine's\nrationality. The bloodthirsty beast in\nher eyes slowly receded, replaced by a\nbrief moment of confusion. When she saw\nthe bloody hole in Yong Doning&lt;unk&gt;s\nneck, her pupils suddenly contracted and\nan emotion called collapse erupted.\n\"This this is what I did,\" she said in a\ntrembling voice, her words filled with\nheartache and guilt. \"Jasmine, what's\nwrong with you?\" Jasmine trembled.\n\"Quick, tie me up. I I can't control\nmyself. Please, I don't want to become a\nblood sucking monster.\" What blood\nsucking monster? This Jasmine. Jasmine.\nYong Donging exclaimed in shock because\nJasmine had suddenly fainted. She's\nfine. I just put her to sleep. Sumu\npushed up his brown tinted glasses,\nconcealing the crystallin blue light in\nhis eyes. By the way, you'd better find\nsome chains to temporarily lock her up\nbecause my hypnosis will soon be broken\nby her bloodthirsty instincts. After\nsaying that, Sumutu went downstairs\nwithout looking back. After a long\nwhile, Yong Dong came downstairs with a\ncomplicated expression. He stopped in\nfront of Sumu and said in a deep voice,\n\"What exactly happened to Jasmine?\" Sumu\ndid not hide anything and told him\ndirectly about Murong Yun kidnapping\nJasmine. After hearing everything, Yong\nDonging&lt;unk&gt;s face contorted into a\nferocious expression, veins bulging on\nhis cheeks, his killing intent almost\nuncontrollable. \"Mong Yun! I'm going to\nkill him!\" He abruptly stood up, his\nanger shattering any remaining reason.\nSitting on the sofa, Su Mu said calmly.\nHe is a silver tear too transcendent.\nWhat about you? Yong Doning kept walking\ncompletely unmoved. After you died, did\nyou think about Jasmine? Yong Doning\npaused, his chest heaving violently. He\nstood there for a long time before he\nfinally regained his composure. Is there\na way to turn vampires back into humans?\nSumu shook his head. As far as I know,\nthere isn't any at the moment. Now is\nnot the time to think about these\nthings. What you should do most right\nnow is to get some blood for Jasmine.\nOtherwise, she will go crazy if she is\nstarved for a long time. As for dealing\nwith Murong Yun, that's quite simple. I\nhappen to have a plan recently. I will\nkill him with my own hands. Yong\nhis fists clenched and his teeth\ngrinding together. His voice filled with\nrage was resolute as if he were making a\nvow. Sumu nodded. To him, Mong Yun was\njust a minor character. What he was\nreally concerned about was the golden\nrealm expert hidden behind Murong Yun,\nShu Yuan. Thanks to the appearance of\nBlood Abyss, his plan became more\ncomplete and brilliant. Sumu then left\nas Yong Donging and Jasmine were indeed\nnot in a good position to meet with\npeople. He returned to the Bronze Coffin\nto inquire about the vampire clan from\nNang Gong Monglay. The Blood Moon Empire\nis composed of vampires and humans.\nthere. Vampires are like nobles while\nhumans are like livestock being sucked\nblood by vampires every day. This\npattern has continued for hundreds of\nyears and the people of the Blood Moon\nEmpire are already used to it. There are\neven special laws in the country to\nprotect humans, requiring vampires not\nto attack humans at will, but to pay\nmoney to buy blood. As Nang Gongly\nnarrated, the general operating system\nof the blood moon empire slowly emerged\nin Su Mu&lt;unk&gt;s mind, and he was not\nsurprised. Chapter 190. Preparations\nbefore the seven deadly sins appear. It\nsounds no different from the Crimson\nFlame Empire. Both involve nobles riding\non commoners and sucking their blood.\nThe only difference is that one is a\nmetaphor while the other is actual blood\nsucking. But there's one thing I'm\ncurious about. Where do vampires come\nfrom? Are they nightmare monsters?\nNangong Mongly pondered and said, \"I'm\nnot quite sure if they are nightmare\ncreatures.\" But according to legend, the\nprogenitor of the vampires was the\nimmortal king who once founded the blood\nmoon empire. The undying king. Sumu was\nsomewhat unfamiliar with this title. The\nundying king is one of the seven kings\nand the so-called seven kings actually\nrefer to the original founders of the\nseven great empires who are also\nrecognized as the seven golden kings.\nThe blood moon empire, the dragon king\nof the dragon abyss empire and the holy\nking of the holy empire among others\nhave vanished into the annals of\nhistory. However, the titles of the\nseven kings have been passed down and\ninherited by their successors who have\nbecome the de facto rulers of the\nempires. Who is the king of the crimson\nflame empire? Nangong mungly shook her\nhead. The Crimson Flame Empire has no\nking. Oh, this surprised Sumu. As we all\nknow, there are only six of the seven\nkings. The Crimson Flame Empire is the\nonly one without a king. To be precise,\nit should have had one before, but for\nsome unknown reason, the king\ndisappeared. It s not just that he\ndisappeared. His descendants and all the\nrelated historical records were also\nwiped out, completely vanishing from the\nworld. Even the king's name has not been\npassed down. The current royal family of\nthe Crimson Flame Empire are nothing\nmore than ministers who once served the\nking. Interesting. Sumu smiled slightly.\nAs he got to know more and more people,\nhe found that the real world was almost\nas interesting as the nightmare world.\nThis pleased him greatly because it\nmeant he wouldn't be bored in either\nreality or the nightmare world. By the\nway, Suzu, you mentioned earlier that\nyou wanted me to meet with Yen Moxy of\nthe Revolutionary Army. Was that part of\na plan? Go tell Yan Moxy that the seven\ndeadly sins have agreed to see him. Sumu\nhad a mysterious smile on his lips, and\nhis brown tinted glasses could hardly\nhide the deep light in his eyes. He then\ngave a few more detailed instructions\nand went to sleep. Of course, for\nsomeone like him, even sleeping wouldn't\nkeep him idle. In the dream, Sumu\ncontrolled the dream to expand\ncontinuously, slowly overlapping with\nmost of Star City. With his current\nlevel of mental strength, it was not\nenough to cover the entire Star City,\nbut it was enough for the time being.\nThe dream stopped when it expanded to\nthe Chong Xingtau Temple. Sumu took a\nstep and as if shrinking the distance,\nhe appeared in the Chong Shing Tauist\nTemple. In an instant, Master Shining,\nwho was sleeping, suddenly opened his\neyes and looked wearily at the dark\nfigure that had suddenly appeared in the\nroom. After recognizing that the person\nwas Sumu, he lowered his guard and\nquickly got up to pay his respects.\nGreetings, Your Excellency, the Divine\nEnvoy. Sumu nodded and casually handed\nover a silver mask. Master Shinshing\nrespectfully accepted the mask, examined\nit closely, and noticed that it depicted\na leerous smiling face. He asked in\nconfusion, \"What is this divine envoy?\nFrom this moment forward, you will\ntemporarily take the place of lust, one\nof the seven deadly sins.\" Shinshing\nsart skipped a beat. He thought of the\nscene when he did the divination. He\nknew that Jun Wuang was the future lust\nand he was Jun Wuang s master. He was\nalso temporarily acting as lust. What\nthe hell? So, it turns out I was the\nfirst generation of lust. Oh no. Could\nit be that I met with some misfortune\nduring the divine envoys plan and died\nand then passed on lust to Jun Wuang?\nNo. I must call that wicked disciple\nback tomorrow and hold an ordination\nceremony for him so that he can gain the\nrecognition of the celestial venerable\nof longevity and then practice the art\nof longevity. In case something\nunexpected happens tomorrow, the lineage\nof longevity will not be cut off. Sikong\nXan will come tomorrow. Help him\ncalculate some information about the\nseven deadly sins. May I ask, divine\nmessenger, what information do you wish\nto obtain? Sumu smiled mysteriously and\nwhispered a few words. The old Tauist\npriest Xianing immediately showed a look\nof shock. Divine Envoy, do you intend\nto? Sumu smiled and nodded, then turned\nand left the Chongqing Tauist temple. He\nused his dream teleportation technique\nagain, and this time he arrived at\nMurang Yan&lt;unk&gt;s home. It was already\ndawn, but Murong Yun had just gone to\nsleep. After becoming a vampire, he\nbecame nocturnal. Although he was not as\nafraid of sunlight as lower level\nvampires, he instinctively hated\nsunlight and disliked going out during\nthe day. Sumu enters Murong Yan&lt;unk&gt;s\ndream. It was a beautiful dream. In his\ndream, Morong Yun became the head of the\nMorong family and returned to the center\nof power in the capital, fulfilling his\ndeceased father, Morong's long cherished\nwish and bringing glory back to the Mong\nfamily. Seeing this, Sumu found it very\ninteresting. In this world, it is the\nvillains who have done all sorts of bad\nthings who dream of sweet dreams all day\nlong, while kind and good people are\noften plagued by all kinds of\nnightmares. Perhaps it's because good\npeople have a harder life and good\npeople often feel guilty for a long time\nafter doing one bad thing. While bad\npeople do all sorts of bad things and\nstill feel it's all justified. He used\nhis own dream to cover up Murong Yan's\ndream and then began to manipulate it.\nThe scene instantly shifts to Muronga's\nbirthday banquet. He stands arrogantly\nin the center looking down on everyone\nwith disdain while Murunga lies in a\npool of blood his head falling to the\nground staring at Murong Yun with wide\nunseeing eyes. This was the most\nterrifying day in Murong Yan&lt;unk&gt;s\notherwise smooth sailing life in a\nnightmare he could never shake off. On\nthat day his father died tragically and\nthe Mong family became a laughing stock.\nSuddenly Morunga's head opened its mouth\nits lips moving repeatedly. Yuner, why\nwon't you avenge your father? Murang\nYun, who was hiding in the crowd, was\nstartled and his face turned pale.\nFather, please don't speak. I'm scared.\nAt that moment, an arrogant gaze fell\nupon them, and they said mockingly,\n\"What? You want revenge?\" Mong Yun waved\nhis hands repeatedly, about to say he\nwouldn't seek revenge, but found himself\nunable to utter a single word. His body\nthen uncontrollably walked out of the\ncrowd and stood before the arrogant man.\nVery good. You have great courage. As a\ntoken of my appreciation, I allow you to\ngo down and keep your father company.\nWith a mere flick of his wrist, the\narrogant man sent Mong Yun&lt;unk&gt;s head\ntumbling to the ground, killing everyone\npresent, including Nang Gong Mly. The\nimage then shattered. A new scene soon\nappeared. This time, Morong Yun\nwitnessed an even more horrifying scene.\nIt was still Moronga's birthday banquet,\nand what appeared were all seven deadly\nsins. uniform black tail coats, top\nhats, white gloves, and silver masks.\nThe only difference is that each silver\nmask has a different expression\nrepresenting seven different emotions:\npride, envy, wrath, sloth, greed,\ngluttony, lust. Chapter 191, Murong\nYan's flash of inspiration. The seven\ndeadly sins upon their arrival went on a\nkilling spree, slaughtering everyone at\nthe banquet, including Nang Gong Mong.\nAfter Murong Yan&lt;unk&gt;s death, the scene\nshifts again like an endless cycle. This\ntime, the seven deadly sins come\ndirectly to the Murong family and wreak\nhavoc, and Nang Gong Mly dies each time.\nHe repeated it again and again. Those\nseven silver masks seem to be engraved\ndeep in Murong Yan's soul, making him\nunable to forget them for a long time.\nWhat's most interesting is that every\ntime the seven deadly sins mobilize as a\nwhole and wreak havoc, it's always envy.\none of the seven deadly sins who kills\nNang Gong Mongllay. Oh, Murong Yun cried\nout in surprise, waking up from his\nnightmare. He was dazed for a moment\nbefore realizing that he was dreaming\nand then he breathed a sigh of relief.\nBut soon his face contorted with rage,\nand he gritted his teeth, saying, \"Damn,\nthe seven deadly sins.\" His feelings\ntoward the seven deadly sins were very\ncomplex, a mixture of fear and relief.\nHe was afraid because of the seven\ndeadly sins power and ruthlessness\nhaving killed his father in front of\neveryone and he was terrified of\nfollowing in his father's footsteps.\nFortunately, it was the seven deadly\nsins who killed her father. Otherwise,\nshe would never have become a vampire\nand had the opportunity to rise to\npower. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Yin calmed down after a\nwhile and just then his phone rang. He\npicked up his phone and saw a message\nfrom the undercover agent working on the\nbronze coffin. 2 days from now at 6 p.m.\nMurang Mungli will leave Shingqing for\nLanchon, presumably to conduct a\ntransaction with a director of a chamber\nof commerce from another province. Upon\nseeing this message, Murong Yun sneered.\nI finally waited for this opportunity.\nWith Sungong Xan in charge of Shingqing,\nit's difficult to make a move against\nyou, but you insisted on courting death\nby leaving Shingqing. Huh? A golden\nopportunity. A golden opportunity. No,\nwe must contact Lord Blood Abyss\nimmediately. This is an opportunity we\ncan't miss. Just as he was about to make\nthe contact, he suddenly stopped. A\nflash of inspiration crossing his mind.\nHis expression turned to ecstatic joy.\nThe seven deadly sins. That's it. The\nseven deadly sins. I can totally use the\nseven deadly sins in this plan. His mind\nraced and a clear and feasible plan\ngradually took shape in his mind. Murong\nMungli is a noble woman and her murder\nwould definitely cause a huge uproar,\nespecially since Sikong Xan is in\nShingqing. This is equivalent to killing\nsomeone right under his nose, which is a\nslap in the face to him. The killing of\na nobleman by the seven deadly sins had\nalready shocked the nation, but then the\ncapital sent an imperial envoy to\ninvestigate, and another nobleman died\nright under the envoy's nose. One can\nimagine the uproar this would cause. See\nKong Xan, who had been searching for the\nseven deadly sins without success, must\nbe furious. In order to prove his\nabilities to the royal family, he would\ndefinitely do his best to investigate\nthe matter of Morong Mungley and give\nthe royal family an explanation. He\ncouldn't just do nothing after two\nnobles died in succession. As the\nbiggest beneficiary after Murang Mung as\ndeath, he would definitely be\ninvestigated. But if Lord Blood Abyss\nwere to impersonate one of the seven\ndeadly sins to commit murder, and I\nhappen to be present at some public\nevent that day, providing a solid alibi,\nthen huh? Murong Yun laughed excitedly,\npraising his own cleverness. By\ndiverting the trouble to the seven\ndeadly sins, Seong Xan won't notice me.\nIt's&lt;unk&gt; perfect. The seven deadly sins\nare truly my lucky star. After a while\nof excitement, he calmed down and\ncontinued to think. It can't be Pride\nthat made the move because Pride let\nMong Mungly go once before and it would\nbe illogical for him to kill Murang\nMungly again now. So the only option is\nto arrange for the other seven deadly\nsins to be involved. Seven silver masks\nwith different expressions kept flashing\nthrough his mind. Finally, a silver mask\nwith a face full of jealousy was fixed\nin his mind. Bronze Coffin Company, an\nordinarylooking middle-aged man stood\nexpressionless in front of Sumu. Chief,\nas you instructed, the message has been\nsent to Murang Yun. Sumu nodded. You did\na good job. You can go now. The\nmiddle-aged man turned and left, his\nexpression returning to normal. Nangong\nMung leaned against the desk, her hands\nsupporting her, her round buttocks\nslightly deformed by the edge of the\ndesk. She gazed at Sumu with interest,\nand asked, \"Are you sure [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Yun will\ndefinitely have Shu Yuan pretend to be\njealous?\" Sumu smiled slightly. I'm sure\nbecause I've already given him a hint in\nhis subconscious. In fact, many times\nwhen people have a flash of inspiration,\na sudden whim, a sixth sense, etc., it's\nall the subconscious at work. What's\ninteresting is that when the\nsubconscious comes out, even if it seems\nabsurd, people often believe it firmly.\nHave you ever bought a lottery ticket?\nDo you think I need to buy lottery\ntickets? Nang Mungly asked with a smile.\nSumu shrugged. What I'm trying to say is\nthat this feeling is a bit like buying\nlottery tickets. For example, you\nsuddenly think of a string of numbers\nand you always have a special feeling\nthat this set of numbers is special and\nthat you are very likely to win the\nlottery and you attribute it to\nintuition. In reality, it might be a\nsubtle hint you noticed while looking at\nthe date on the poster, the time on your\nphone, or other clues. Really, Nangong\nMoonly gently tucked a stray strand of\nhair behind her ear, revealing her fair\nand delicate profile and smiled\nslightly. So, Suzu, every time I see\nyou, I get all excited because you've\nalso planted a seed of affection in me.\nIt could also be because you're more\ninclined to look down. Nangly, she gave\nSumu a reproachful look, then said\ncasually. So, you're sure Xuin will\nlisten to Mong Yin? Why not? Actually,\nif they weren't so stupid, they should\nhave thought of this plan long ago. If\nyou don't die, Murong Yin can't take\nover, which doesn't fit the purpose of\nBlood Abyss wanting to infiltrate the\nCrimson Flame Empire. But if you die,\nMurang Yun will be the biggest suspect.\nAt this time, the best thing to do is to\nfind a scapegoat. A scapegoat whose\nactions, even if they involved killing a\nnobleman, would seem justifiable. Suzu,\nsometimes I think you are really scary.\nPeople's hearts are like toys in your\nhands. You just need to hide behind the\nscenes, and those gold level powerhouses\nare like chess pieces on a chessboard,\nwhich you can control at will. She\npaused for a moment, then smiled and\nsaid, \"Of course, she's also very\ncharming. Thank you for the compliment.\"\n\"All right, it's time for me to make my\nmove.\" Nangongly left and went to a\nsecluded coffee shop. Perhaps because of\nits remote location and simple decor,\nthere were no customers in the coffee\nshop at the time. Only a young man\ndressed as a waiter. Chapter 192 Pride\nwill find you. Hello. What would you\nlike to drink? A cup of Emerald Estates\npremium taste. No roses. cold brewed\nwith nitrogen, three spoonfuls of sugar\nin the coffee. Also, I like the swan\ndesign. Please make the latte art in the\nshape of a swan. Thank you. The waiter\nsmiled and nodded. Okay, please wait a\nmoment. Before long, a cup of coffee\nwith swan-like milk foam floating on the\nsurface was placed on the table. Just\nthen, a horse voice rang in Nang Gong\nMlia's mind, like the voice of an old\nsmoker who had smoked too much, or as if\nit had been honed by the years, and was\nfull of stories. It's nice to meet you\nagain, Miss Morang. Nang Gong Mungly\ntook a sip of coffee with an unperturbed\nexpression. The pale milk foam stained\nher red lips. She gently licked it and\nsaid softly, \"Mr. Yan, are you not\nplanning to show your face? No need to\nspeak. This is my subordinate ability,\nmental link. You can think of it as\nmaking a phone call using your mind. I'm\nnot in this coffee shop, so I'm\ncommunicating with you this way for now.\nSo, any news from seven deadly sins?\"\nArrogance agrees to see you. Very good.\nYan Moxy sor voice revealed a hint of\nsatisfaction. Time and place. Nang Gong\nMingly put down her coffee, a mysterious\nsmile playing on her lips. You don't\nneed to know because pride will come\nlooking for you personally. Yanmoxy fell\ninto a brief silence. This sentence\nrevealed a lot of information. As one of\nthe deputy commanders of the\nrevolutionary army, he was a wanted\nperson throughout the country.\nNaturally, he had to hide his\nwhereabouts when he came to Shining. It\ncould be said that apart from himself,\neven his subordinates did not know his\nlocation. But arrogance says he'll come\nin person, which means his every move\ncould be under the other party's\ncontrol. Otherwise, how could the other\nparty find him? However, he was, after\nall, a gold level expert, and his\ntemperament was naturally far beyond\nthat of ordinary people. He calmly\nreplied, \"All right, I'll wait.\" Then\nthe mental link broke, and Yin Moxy's\nvoice disappeared. Nang Mungly continued\ndrinking her coffee. After all, wasting\nfood is shameful. Right across from her,\nSumu was sitting with great interest. He\nwas sitting on a large leather sofa,\nwhich did not dent at all, and no one\nnoticed that there was an extra person\nin the coffee shop. A mental link. It\ndoesn't seem that difficult. With his\npowerful mental strength, he can master\nsome mental techniques even without\nrelying on the law. It's like someone\nwho is naturally strong and runs\nextremely fast. Even if they don't know\nanything about rugby, they can achieve\nresults with just a little training. The\nsaying, \"If you understand one method,\nyou understand all methods,\" perfectly\nillustrates this point. He slowly stood\nup and watched as a thin thread of\nspiritual energy was pulled away from\nNang Gong Munley's body at an incredibly\nfast speed, imperceptible to the naked\neye. But none of this could stop Sumu.\nHe caught up with the disappearing\nspiritual thread as if he were\nteleporting, and his body passed through\nlayers of walls and room after room like\na ghost. Finally, his body sank into the\nground and arrived at a small\nunderground base. To maintain secrecy,\nthe base was built to be very small with\nonly three staff members. One of them, a\nwoman with short brown hair, was the one\nwho had just used the mental link.\nAnother spiritual thread is extending\nfrom afar, its origin unknown. Brother\nYen, is that arrogant guy really that\npowerful? He was able to find you? Even\nthe Crimson Flame Empire couldn't do\nthat. The short-haired woman\ncommunicated via mental link. I don't\nknow. Yin Moxy's voice was completely\ncalm. I haven't told anyone my location,\nso there's no possibility that there's a\nspy within the organization who could\nhave exposed my whereabouts. Perhaps\narrogance has some unknown means of\ninvestigation. But brother Yen, you are\nalso a gold level expert, and you are\nvery skilled in concealment. Otherwise,\nthe organization would not have sent you\nhere. So many gold level experts in the\nempire could not find you. Arrogance has\nnever even seen what you look like. How\ncould he find you? In my opinion, he is\njust bluffing. Now I've seen it. Sumu,\nwho was in the underground base, had\nalready disappeared. He teleported to\nYan Moxy's side via the network cable\nand the mental thread. He carefully\nexamined Yin Moxy. The man was wearing a\ntattered black trench coat, sunglasses,\nand had a cigarette dangling from his\nmouth. He was sitting at a small stall\neating stinky tofu. With a full beard\nand a somewhat thin build, but with\nwell-defined features and sharp angles,\nhe appeared to be around 30 years old,\nexuding the air of a mature, older man.\nSumu's purpose in coming here was to\nmeet Yin Moxy so that he could easily\nfind him through dream teleportation.\nHowever, he did not expect that Yin Moxy\nwould not show up, so he had to go\nthrough a lot of trouble. However, it\nwasn't a complete waste of time. At\nleast I witnessed another use of mental\npower, mental linking. For many\nextraordinary individuals, the law is\nlike a weapon. They possess the weapon\nand can use it, but they do not\nunderstand the principles behind it. But\nSumu is different. Having squandered a\nhundred years in the dream world, his\ncontrol over mental power has reached\nits peak. He can easily understand the\nprinciples of some simple mental laws\nand then learn to use them. Yanmoxy was\nunaware that Sumu had already sat down\nopposite him and continued talking to\nhimself. He has no need to bluff. A\nperson who dares to challenge the bottom\nline of the empire and kill a nobleman\nin full view of everyone would not do\nsuch a pointless thing. He should really\nbe able to find me. Perhaps the\norganization should raise its rating for\narrogance. The strength revealed by\nkilling Mongu might just be the tip of\nthe iceberg. The short-haired woman\nsuddenly said with a wicked grin,\n\"Brother Yen, how about this? You find a\nsecluded place to hide. Aren't you very\nconfident? I don't believe that if you\nreally want to hide. No one in this\nworld can find you. I'm not that bored.\nI'm hanging up. Yanmoxy disconnected the\nmental link. He then stopped eating the\nstinky tofu in front of him, hurriedly\npaid the bill, and then blended into the\ncrowd and left. He cautiously sensed his\nsurroundings, and after confirming that\nno one was paying attention to him, he\nwalked into a dark alley. Then an\nunbelievable scene unfolded. Yin Moxy's\nbody began to melt as if swallowed by\nthe shadows on the ground, and he sank\ninto the shadows and disappeared. Seeing\nthis, Sumu was speechless. Was the\ndeputy commander of the Revolutionary\nArmy really this arrogant? He said he\ndidn't want it, but after hanging up, he\ndidn't even eat the stinky tofu and\nturned around and hid. A shadow moved\nswiftly in the darkness, almost blending\ninto the darkness itself, making it\ndifficult to distinguish. Moxy, now in\nshadow, arrived at the edge of the alley\nwhere the ground was bathed in sunlight.\nWhoosh! He disappeared. And when he\nreappeared, he was already attached to\nthe shadow of a passerby. Silver Law\nsequence 49. Shadow Walker. Sumu stared\nat the black shadow that kept flickering\namong the shadows of passers by and\nroughly guessed some of Yan Moxy's\nabilities. Chapter 193. The mastermind\nbehind everything. Yan Moxy moved\nincredibly fast in the shadows, almost\nlike teleportation. Under normal\ncircumstances, even a gold-ranked expert\nof the same level would have difficulty\ncatching up with him. Unfortunately, he\nencountered Sumu. No matter how fast Yin\nMoxy is, he can never match Sumu in the\ndream because Sumu in the dream is\nalmost omnipotent. The two sped along\nand just 10 minutes later, Yin Moxy\nslipped into a magnificent building and\nlay in wait. Upon seeing the building,\nSumu&lt;unk&gt;s expression turned slightly\nstrange. He realized that Yan Moxy's\nthought process was truly different from\nthat of normal people. He was genuinely\nfearless in his pursuit of hideand seek.\nThis magnificent building is none other\nthan the Star City Law Enforcement\nBureau. He knew that Sikong Jan was in\ncharge of the Shingqing Law Enforcement\nBureau, but he still chose to hide\nthere. It was unclear whether he was\nskilled and daring or simply had a\nstrong competitive spirit. Sumu smiled\nhelplessly. He didn't care anyway. Even\nif the location was the imperial palace\nin the capital, it wouldn't make any\ndifference to him. Then his figure\ndisappeared from the spot. When he\nreappeared, he had arrived at the\nChongqing Tawis temple. Master Shinshing\nis helping Seung Xan with divination.\nLet me make this clear first. This is\nthe last time. I want to live a few more\nyears. After this, whether it succeeds\nor not, don't come again. Master\nShianing said reluctantly. Sung Xan\nnodded solemnly. I promise you, Daist,\nthis is the last time. He verbally\nagreed, but in reality, he already had a\nplan in mind. If he still couldn't\nfigure it out, he would have to use Jun\nWu Shang s life as leverage to force\nMaster Shinshing to do so. Master\nShianing was already a dying man, so\nforcing him was useless, and he had no\nchoice but to target Jun Wu Shan. Master\nShinshing s expression softened\nslightly, but he secretly chuckled to\nhimself. They've fallen for it. He\npretended to tell fortunes, resorting to\nthe usual shamanistic rituals, which\nmade Sung Xan&lt;unk&gt;s temples throb.\nMaster, please skip these tedious\nrituals. I don't have that much time to\nwaste. Seeing that See Kong Xan\nexpression was unfriendly, Master\nShining stopped what he was doing and\ngot straight to the point, beginning to\nchant incantations over the newly carved\nstatue of the Celestial Venerable of\nLongevity. A moment later, Elder\nSchwaning&lt;unk&gt;s face turned pale, and he\nspat out a mouthful of blood. his body\nswaying precariously. Seeing this,\nSikong Xhin quickly helped up Daist\nShiing. Did you fail? Master Xianing\nshook his head weakly. It was\nsuccessful, but the statue was newly\ncarved, which caused the transmission of\nthe divine power of the celestial\nvenerable of longevity to be uns. So,\nthe future scene displayed could not be\nformed at all and was intermittent.\nFortunately, my heart is sincere, and I\nhave glimpsed a corner of the future.\nSung Xan was overjoyed. Please speak\nfrankly, Dowist Master. The Empire will\nnever forget your contributions. I\ndidn't dare to count pride, but instead\nsettled for the other members of the\nseven deadly sins. Other members will\ndo. As long as we capture any one of the\nseven deadly sins, we can obtain\ninformation about them. May I ask,\nmaster, which one did you calculate?\nJealousy. Jealousy. Jealousy. Sungan\nnarrowed his eyes slightly. Who is his\ntrue identity? I didn't figure out his\nidentity. I only figured out his\nlocation. What location? Sung Xan asked\nanxiously, mainly because he saw that\nMaster Shinshing was weak. As if he were\ngiving his last words, as if he was\nabout to breathe his last. Lon Lon Lon,\nwhat? Daist Master, tell me quickly. You\ncan't die yet. Sung Xan was extremely\nanxious. He quickly took out a bottle of\nvaluable healing potion from his body,\nopened the cap, and was about to pour it\ninto Daoist Master Schwaning&lt;unk&gt;s\nmouth. But at this moment, Master\nShinshing seemed to have a sudden burst\nof energy before death. He stared at the\nbottle of extraordinary potion with\nshining eyes, snatched the potion away,\nand put it into his pocket. He stood\nleisurely to the side as if nothing had\nhappened, appearing dignified, and\nignoring Seong Xan's gloomy expression,\nand said indifferently. \"Lanchan, Master\nShining,\" Seek Xan said in a deep voice,\nhis eyes filled with gloom. \"Lanchan in\n3 days. This is a good opportunity to\ncapture the seven deadly sins. Greed.\nSung Xan&lt;unk&gt;s anger faltered. Two of\nthe seven deadly sins. Yes, that's what\nI saw in the future. Anyway, jealousy\nseems to have something important to do.\nHe met with greed. The two of them were\nacting suspiciously. They definitely\nweren't up to anything. You should go to\nLan and ambush them. Upon receiving the\nnews, Seong Xan frowned deeply. What is\nthe strength of those two? Master\nShinshing pondered for a moment. It\nshould be gold level. The two seemed to\nbe at odds and even fought. They look\nlike gold level experts. Upon hearing\nthis, Seong Xan&lt;unk&gt;s brows furrowed\neven deeper. Master Shian gave him a\ndisdainful look. You forced me to do the\ndivination, and now that I figured it\nout, you're too scared to go. What good\nwas my divination? If you can't handle\nit, why don't you go and call someone?\nSung Xan ignored Shinqing Daois sarcasm\nand said in a deep voice, \"3 days is too\nshort. There is no time to transfer\npeople from the capital and the\ncommotion would be too great which might\nalert the enemy. The royal family has\ngiven me the authority to transfer\npeople from surrounding cities. But\namong the nearest cities only the Shintu\nfamily head is a gold level expert.\nWithout knowing the abilities of\njealousy and greed, even with the\nsupport of a group of law enforcement\nsuperhums, a twoon two situation is by\nno means foolproof. What the hell is\nthis seven deadly sins organization? Is\nit really true? As the rumors say that\nall seven members are gold level\npowerhouses. Oh, I thought it was\nsomething serious. Who said it was two\nagainst two? You can take advantage of\nthe time difference and make it two\nagainst one. Master Shianing said\nnonchalantly. Sung Xan was taken aback.\nTime difference. He seemed to realize\nsomething and quickly asked, \"Dowist\nMaster, are there still some details\nabout the future that haven't been\nrevealed? In the future? Jealousy\narrives at Lanchon a day in advance to\nwait while greed arrives on the third\nday. Do you understand now? You can send\npeople to ambush Lan on the second day\nto capture jealousy first and then\ncapture greed on the third day. Wouldn't\nthat be foolproof? Sung Xan was\nimmediately overjoyed. Xian the old\ntowist continued talking to himself.\nDidn't you see the seven deadly sins\nmask in the future vision before? If I\nwere you, I would just impersonate greed\nthe next day. Go to launch shawn as a\ngreed and then take advantage of\njealousy's unpreparedness to launch a\nsneak attack. After jealousy is injured,\nyou two gold level experts can take on\none of you. Surely you can handle it.\nThen on the third day, they repeated the\nsame trick, impersonating Envy to ambush\nGreed, who had come to the appointment,\neasily defeating the two of the seven\ndeadly sins. See Xan&lt;unk&gt;s eyes lit up\nas he listened because Master Shinshing\ns plan was completely feasible. When he\nheard about the time difference, he had\nalready vaguely formed the outline of\nthe plan in his mind. He didn't expect\nthat Master Shinshing would say it out\nloud now. Master, if we can successfully\ncapture the seven deadly sins this time,\nI will report your merits to the royal\nfamily. Also, I don't need that bottle\nof extraordinary potion anymore. The old\nTauist Shinshing immediately glared and\nbristled. What's in my hands? You want\nback? No way. With a sense of relief,\nSung Xan hurriedly prepared to mobilize\nhis troops. At this moment, the voice of\nthe old Tauist Shinshing drifted over.\nDon't blame me for not reminding you.\nThe future is not immutable. If you know\nthe future and do nothing, it will not\nchange. But once you do something,\nespecially if you make a big fuss, the\nimpact on the future will be greater.\nMoreover, what I see is only a glimpse\nof the future, not the whole picture. No\none knows what will happen after\njealousy and greed collide. Despite\nMaster Shinqing s well-intentioned\nreminder, Si Kong Xan paid no attention.\nHe simply waved his hand dismissively to\nindicate that he understood and then\nleft Chongqing to temple. Sumu, who\nwitnessed the entire event, maintained\nan elegant smile throughout, observing\neverything silently like a bystander.\nThe situation at the Chongqing Tauist\nTemple is also progressing smoothly.\nApart from the fact that the old Tauist\nShinshing is still hard to change and\nembezzled a bottle of extraordinary\nmedicine from Sikong Xen, everything is\nproceeding according to plan. Chapter\n194. Arrogance appears. Master Shinshing\nhappily played with the extraordinary\npotion in his hand. He opened the lid,\nsniffed it, and immediately his face was\nfilled with ecstasy. It tastes just\nright. It's definitely the divine\nhealing potion produced by the Federal\nPharmaceutical Company. Huh. It's known\nas the gold level extraordinary potion\nthat can bring the dead back to life and\nheal bones as if it were a divine cure.\nI'm rich. I'm rich, Master Shinshing. I\ndon't recall this step being part of the\nplan, is it? Sumu's soft voice sounded\nfrom behind Master Shinshing. Master\nShianing was startled, almost dropping\nthe healing potion in his hand. Turning\naround and seeing Sumu, he immediately\nput on a smile that looked more like a\ngrimace. Divine Envoy, I was only\nthinking of you. You are of noble birth.\nWhat if something happens to you during\nthis mission? So, you deliberately\ntricked Sikong Xan into giving me the\ndivine healing potion, right? Sumu\nsmiled as he took the divine healing\npotion from Master Shianing. Yes, yes,\nthat's exactly right, said the old\ntowist Shianing with a mournful face. H,\nyou've put in a good thought. I will\nreport your good intentions to the\ncelestial venerable of longevity. After\nsaying that, Sumu left with the healing\npotion. Master Shinshing seemed to lose\nall hope of living in an instant, and\nthe light in his eyes disappeared. My\nmiraculous healing potion. A moment\nlater, a blood curdling scream came from\nthe Chongqing Tauist Temple. A truly\nhorrific sound. Night. The Shingqing Law\nEnforcement Bureau. Yanmoxy sat quietly\non a wooden box like a statue, now\nsomewhat regretful. In his struggle\nagainst arrogance, he acted as if he\nwere a criminal arrested by law\nenforcement. Locked up in a warehouse\nall day without seeing the light of day.\nHow carefree it would be to eat and\ndrink while out in the world. He patted\nhis empty stomach and hesitated. Should\nhe go out for some barbecue and a beer?\nHe had just gotten up, but then sat back\ndown. Yanmoxy thought about it and\ndecided against it. He had already\nsuffered all day. If he were to be found\nby Aommen after going out, wouldn't all\nthe suffering he had endured that day\nhave been for nothing? Let's wait\nanother day. If arrogance still hasn't\nappeared by tomorrow, it means the other\nparty was just bluffing. After waiting a\nwhile longer, Yin Moxy couldn't sit\nstill any longer. He transformed into a\nshadow and quietly sneaked into the law\nenforcement bureau's office area. It was\nnighttime, so most of the law\nenforcement officers had already left\nwork, leaving only a few onduty\npersonnel. Many areas of the office were\ndark, making it an ideal place for him\nto infiltrate. A bag of cookies that had\nbeen halfeaten on a workstation. Soon, a\nbizarre scene unfolded. The shadows\nbeneath the workbench began to slowly\nwrigle, and a hand made of shadow\nquietly climbed onto the table. Then,\nwhoosh! He pulled the cookie into the\nshadows and it disappeared. In the\nunderground warehouse, Yin Moxy ate some\nbiscuits. The cookies seemed to have\nbeen sitting for a while and weren't\ncrispy at all, but he still ate them\nwith great relish. Just then, a soft\nlaugh sounded behind him. Huh. I didn't\nexpect the deputy commander of the\nrevolutionary army to have a pinchant\nfor stealing expired cookies. Yin Moxy,\nwho was stealing food, froze. He turned\naround and saw a man dressed in a black\ntail coat and wearing a silver mask\nstanding on a wooden box looking down at\nhim. Yan Moxy narrowed his eyes slightly\nto conceal the shock in them. He\npretended to be calm and carefully\nexamined the newcomer. The icy sneer\nhanging above the silver mask, sharp as\nan ice blade, curved slightly upwards,\nfull of contempt and disdain, already\nrevealing the newcomers identity.\nArrogance, Yin Moxy said in a deep\nvoice, \"How did you know I was here?\"\nSumu didn't answer, but instead asked,\n\"Are expired cookies tasty?\" \"Yan Moxy.\"\nHe glanced at it out of the corner of\nhis eye and realized that the cookie was\nindeed past its expiration date.\nAlthough his face remained\nexpressionless, his heart was in\nturmoil. Arrogance not only knew that he\nwas in the law enforcement agency, but\nalso knew that he had stolen cookies and\nthat the cookies were expired. What did\nthis mean? This means that your every\nmove is under the other party's watchful\neye, yet you were completely unaware of\nit. The feeling is almost like an\ninvisible person following you the whole\ntime, watching your every move, which is\nquite frightening. This was the second\ntime he had felt this way since becoming\na gold saint. The first time was when he\nfirst joined the revolutionary army and\nfaced its leader. In fact, Yin Moxy's\nguess was correct. Sumu had indeed been\nfollowing behind him, silently watching\nhis every move. It tastes pretty good.\nWould you like to try some? Yan Moxy\nsuddenly reached out and handed over the\nbiscuit. Sumu smiled slightly. There's\nno need to test me. What's in front of\nyou now is indeed not my true form, but\njust an avatar. Yin Moxy's eyes flashed.\nas a gold level expert. After a brief\nmoment of astonishment, he naturally\nnoticed the arrogance's unusual nature.\nThe other party seemed to be not a\nphysical entity, but he did not expect\nthe other party to admit it directly.\nSpeak. What do you revolutionary army\nwant to see me about? Your excellency\npride, if I may be so bold, our\nrevolutionary army has come with\nsincerity this time. While you have only\nsent an avatar in particular, since you\nseven deadly sins always appear in\nperson wearing masks, how can I be sure\nthat you are pride? Yinmoxy did not\ndirectly state his purpose. He was not\nstupid to have reached the position of\ndeputy commander of the revolutionary\narmy. He would not reveal everything\njust because he saw a clone. Of course,\nhe also believed in his heart that the\narrogance in front of him was not\nsomeone else impersonating him. After\nall, such terrifying detection methods\nwere not something that ordinary people\ncould do. He said that as a way of\ntesting the waters further. The\nrevolutionary army's desire to cooperate\nwith the seven deadly sins was based on\ninitial mutual understanding. Not like\nnow where they don't even know how many\nmembers the seven deadly sins have or\ntheir specific strength. A contemptuous\nlaugh came from beneath the silver mask.\nBoring probing. I don't have time to\nwaste on someone like you. You want to\njudge whether the seven deadly sins are\nqualified to cooperate with the\nrevolutionary army. Coincidentally, I\nhave the same idea. The Crimson Flame\nEmpire for so long, constantly chanting\nslogans to overthrow the nobility, but\ndaring not to kill a single noble, truly\ndeserve to cooperate with the seven\ndeadly sins. Yin Moxy's expression was\nsomewhat grim, and he said in a deep\nvoice, \"It's not that we dare not, but\nthat it's unnecessary. The Crimson Flame\nEmpire would pay a large ransom to\nredeem a nobleman and that amount of\nmoney. The weak only know how to argue.\nIf the Revolutionary Army is only this\ngood, then don't waste my time. After he\nfinished speaking, Sumu's figure began\nto slowly become transparent, as if he\nwas about to disappear. Yanmoxy couldn't\nhold back any longer. He had come here\nbecause he wanted to cooperate with the\nseven deadly sins, so he couldn't just\nstand by and watch Pride leave like\nthis. He quickly replied. You arrogant\nsir, wait. How do you expect our\nrevolutionary army to prove anything?\nChapter 195. The golden law. Shadow\ndemon. Beneath the silver mask. Sumu's\nlips curled slightly. It's&lt;unk&gt; simple.\nStrength is the foundation of\ncooperation. Show me your strength. If\nyou can meet my standards, then\ncooperation can proceed. Yen Moxy's eyes\nnarrowed. Then I'll let Lord Arrogance\nsee if our revolutionary army is truly\nqualified. Where is your real body? Or\nare you planning to use a clone to fight\nme? Haha. Arrogance laughed\nuncontrollably as if he had heard a\nfunny joke, his laughter full of\ncontempt. Deputy Commander Yen, it seems\nyou not only enjoy stealing expired\ncookies, but also telling jokes. I hope\nyou'll think before you speak in the\nfuture. Fight me. You're not worthy. Yan\nMoxy s face was icy cold, clearly\nindicating that he was truly enraged. If\nyour commander comes, I might be\nsomewhat interested in taking action. As\nfor you, lust. Sumu suddenly called out\nto the air beside him. In an instant, a\nman dressed in the same style of\ntailcoat and wearing a silver mask\nappeared out of thin air in the\nwarehouse. Yin Moxy's pupils suddenly\ncontracted. If he hadn't noticed the\nsudden appearance of arrogance just now,\nhe could explain it by being unprepared.\nBut now, another one of the seven deadly\nsins had appeared out of nowhere, right\nunder his nose, and he still couldn't\ndetect any signs. What kind of ability\nis this? Teleportation? No, that's not\nright. There wasn't even the slightest\nspatial fluctuation. \"Leader,\" Lust said\nrespectfully from the side without\nglancing at Yan Moxy once as if he were\ncompletely ignoring him. \"Go test its\nquality.\" Lust then slowly turned his\nhead, and what came into Yin Moxy s view\nwas a different silver white mask. The\neyes were more curved and narrow, and\nthe corners of the mouth were upturned\nmore, as if a person was ludely smiling.\n\"Chief, what if we accidentally kill\nsomeone?\" lust asked his voice sincere\nas if he were genuinely considering the\nquestion. The weak have no value in\nliving. With that, the arrogant figure\nvanished completely. The vast warehouse\nwas left with only Yin, Moxy, and Lust,\nwho were staring at each other from\nafar, also known as Master Shinshing. At\nthis moment, Master Shining had clearly\ndisguised himself. He used Tauist magic\nto change his appearance, making his\noriginally hunched body straight and his\nwhole body much taller. Yanmoxy stared\nintently at lust. He knew very well that\nsince pride had chosen lust to measure\nhim, it meant that lust was also a gold\nlevel expert. Another gold saint. Who\nexactly are these seven deadly sins? He\noriginally thought that the seven deadly\nsins, namely pride as the leader, was a\ngold saint. After all, gold saints are\nnot easy to come by. There are only four\nin the entire revolutionary army. They\nare the commander-in-chief and three\ndeputy commanders chief. Generally\nspeaking, an organization can be\nconsidered first class if it has one\ngold level expert. However, with the\narrival of the seven deadly sins, two\ngold ranked experts appeared already\naccounting for half of the revolutionary\narmy's high in combat power. And this\nwas without the other seven deadly sins\nshowing up. If, as the rumors suggest,\nall seven members of the Seven Deadly\nSins are gold saints, then the\norganization's strength cannot be\ndescribed as merely formidable. It is\nterrifying. Uncle, since the leader has\nsaid so, you'd better be careful. Don't\nblame me if you die. Master Shinshing\nshook his head slightly, his old bones\nmaking a cracking sound, but his voice\nwas as young as a boys. Clearly, he\nportrays himself as an innocent and\nbeautiful young man. Having not made a\nmove for many years, he could not hide\nhis excitement at this moment. It was\nnot that he did not want to make a move,\nbut that the longevity technique would\nharm both the enemy and himself if used.\nwho would be so bored as to shorten\ntheir own lifespan to play with it. But\nnow with Sumu's support, he no longer\nneeds to worry about the limitations of\nhis lifespan and can fight a good\nbattle. Before coming here, Sumu\nrandomly selected more than a dozen\nsocial scum in the lower city, plundered\ntheir lifespans, and instilled them into\nDaoist Shinqing. Because Master\nShinshing sength is at the gold level,\nthe quality of his lifespan is very\nhigh. The combined lifespan of these\ndozen or so ordinary people, amounting\nto several hundred years, is only enough\nto extend Master Shinshin s lifespan by\na few years, but it is still sufficient\nto deal with a battle. Seeing that lust\nwas about to make a move, Yin Moxy's\nexpression changed. Wait a minute. Do\nyou want to make a move in the law\nenforcement bureau? Master Shinshing was\ntaken aback. Indeed, wouldn't it be\nsuicide to make a move in the law\nenforcement bureau? Just as he was about\nto speak, he suddenly remembered what\nSumu had told him to do, to be as\narrogant as possible. So the words that\nwere on the tip of his tongue turned\ninto disdain like a teenager bragging.\n\"So what if we fight at the law\nenforcement bureau? If they dare to come\nand bother us, we'll just kill them\nall.\" Yanmoxy felt a chill run down his\nspine. He realized that these seven\ndeadly sins were all lawless and\narrogant. He had already witnessed the\narrogance of the arrogant, but now this\nseemingly young man, Lust, was also so\nbrazen, his words showed no respect for\nthe enforcement bureau. Their\nrevolutionary army was already the\nlargest rebel organization in the\nempire, and they wouldn't dare to do\nsuch a thing under normal circumstances,\nbut the seven deadly sins dared to. Yin\nMoxy didn't know was that Master\nShinshin didn't actually dare to fight\nhere either. But that's how the game\nbetween people works. I know you don't\ndare, so I dare. Anyway, you'll have to\npersuade me later. As expected, Yin Moxy\nadvised. There's no need to create\nunnecessary trouble. Come with me.\nWhoosh. Yanmoxy transformed into a\nshadow and slipped out through the crack\nin the window, disappearing into the\ndarkness. A lustful, dissatisfied voice\ncame from behind him. Hey, don't go.\nI've never been in a fight at the law\nenforcement bureau before. It's so much\nfun. Yen Moxy ran even faster,\ndisappearing completely into the\ndarkness in the blink of an eye. This\ntime it was Master Shinshing s turn to\nbe dumbfounded. Holy crap. This kid's\ngolden law is shadow demon. Damn it. The\nlaw that's supposed to be best at\nescaping and ambushing. And it's still\nnighttime. How am I supposed to keep up\nwith this old tauist? Just as he gritted\nhis teeth, preparing to expend some of\nhis lifespan to calculate Yin Moxy's\nlocation, Sumu&lt;unk&gt;s voice rang in\nShianing Daists mind through the mental\nlink 100 Lee to the east. Master\nShinqing was taken aback at first, then\noverjoyed as he had saved several more\ndays of his lifespan. In a desolate\nwilderness, Yin Moxy emerged from the\nshadows and transformed into human form.\nHe looked around at the empty darkness\nand a slight smile appeared on his lips.\nHis golden law, Shadow Fiend, is best at\nescaping. The reason he went all out to\nshake off lust was to make his opponent\nsuffer and reduce Lust's momentum. In a\nbattle between true strong men,\nsometimes the contest of momentum is\nalso extremely important. Just as he was\nfeeling smug, suddenly a triumphant\nlaugh, unique to teenagers, rang out\nbehind him. He got you. Yanmoxy was\nshocked and quickly turned around. He\nsaw that Lu Yu was holding a gleaming\nlong sword and was coming from a 100\nmeters away like a sword immortal.\nChapter 196. Lust versus Yen Moxy. Damn\nit, when did he get behind me? Yenmoxy,\nwho was always extremely confident in\nhis speed, was a little on guard at this\nmoment. He was the one who came out of\nthe law enforcement bureau first and\nchose the destination himself. But Lust\nhad actually run further than him. But\nhe didn't have time to think about it.\nHe spread his hands out, and the shadows\naround him surged silently, turning into\nthousands of thin black lines that\nconverged in his palms, intertwining\nwildly like weaving a ball of yarn.\nthrow the shadow orb in his hand. An\neven stranger scene unfolded. Lust, who\nwas rushing towards him from a hundred\nmeters away, disappeared as if by\nteleportation. Before he could even see\nhow the other person disappeared, a bone\nch-shilling coldness swept over him from\nbehind, and the hairs on the back of his\nneck stood on end. The shadow orb behind\nhim. The shadow orb instantly\ntransformed into a curtain of shadow.\nWhoosh! A flash of sword light appeared\nand lust unfolded a curtain of shadow\nemerging abruptly from within. Attacked\nYin Moxy again, this time with Lust\ngaining the upper hand. In the rush, Yin\nMoxy could only defend passively.\nStanding to the side, Sumu smiled. Yin\nMoxy was quite strong and he couldn't\nguarantee that Daoist Shian would win,\nso he naturally had to lend a hand. With\nhis current strength, although he can't\nhurt a gold level expert, he can still\ndistract them. The lustful figure who\ncharged at them from a 100 meters away\nwith a sword was actually an illusion\ncreated by all things in the world and\nendless demonic sound. The reason they\nwere so far away was to prevent Yin Moxy\nfrom seeing through the illusion. Just\nas Yin Moxy was distracted, the newly\narrived Tauist Shinshing seized the\nopportunity to launch an attack. Firmly\ngaining the upper hand, Yin Moxy, as\nexpected of the deputy commander of the\nRevolutionary Army, quickly began to\nexert his strength. After a brief moment\nof panic, he instantly disappeared into\nthe shadows, teleporting away from\nMaster Shinshing. He reached out his\npalm, his powerful five fingers grabbing\nat the darkness. The darkness seemed to\ncome alive as he held it firmly in his\nhand. Then the darkness surged like\nwater and with a forceful swing,\nhundreds of shadow orbs resembling\nminiature black holes shot out. They\ncovered everything, densely packed,\ncompletely sealing off the area around\nMaster Shinshing. Master Shinshing s\nexpression changed. He held his long\nsword upright in front of him and made a\nhand seal with one hand. Longevity\ntechnique 10,000 swords buzz. A crisp\nsword cry echoed across the wilderness.\nThe long sword in his hand split in two\nand then in four, instantly transforming\ninto a sea of swords to meet the shadow\norb. The sounds of fierce collisions\nwere incessant. The shadow orb seemed to\ncontain extremely high energy,\nannihilating the long swords it touched\ninch by inch. Fortunately, there were\nmore long swords than shadow orbs, so it\ndid not immediately lose. Yen Moxy\nseized the opportunity and pressed down\nwith one hand. Dark surge. The darkness\nwithin a radius of several miles seemed\nto be dragged in by some force,\nfrantically gathering at the feet of\nDaist Shiqin, with terrifying energy\nbrewing. Boom! The shadow energy erupted\nlike a volcanic eruption. And the\nviolent torrent of shadow energy\ncarrying an aura of destruction engulfed\nMaster Shining. \"Holy crap! Are all\nyoung people these days this fierce?\"\nMaster Shianing exclaimed inwardly, but\nhis hands moved without slowing down at\nall. The art of immortality, the cycle\nof life and death of all things. A beam\nof azure light suddenly appeared beneath\nhis feet, spreading out to form a\nmassive azure light array that firmly\nblocked the dark current. The originally\nraging dark currents upon contact with\nthe azure light array seemed to lose\ntheir strength and began to gradually\nweaken. Yin Moxy's heart skipped a beat.\nWhat kind of law was this? Did it\ninvolve time? As the caster, he could\nclearly feel the shadow power weakening,\njust like the blooming, withering, and\ndecay of a flower, its power constantly\ndiminishing. Meanwhile, the Azure light\narray was growing stronger, like a seed\ntaking root, sprouting, growing, and\nblossoming. How powerful must their\nleader's arrogance be? He suddenly\nunderstood why arrogance had been so\ndisdainful of him when he tried to fight\nit before. Judging from the current\nsituation, he was indeed not qualified\nto fight arrogance. However, as a gold\nlevel expert, he could not give up the\nfight just because the enemy's methods\nwere strange. He took a deep breath. His\nexpression became solemn, and his aura\nbegan to surge continuously. The\nsurrounding shadows were drawn by this\ninvisible aura, and the darkness\ntrembled like ripples on water. Strands\nof shadow constantly gathered towards\nYin Moxy, like countless black ribbons\nwrapping around him. As darkness\ngathered, Yin Moxy's figure was almost\nswallowed up by it. At this moment, he\nhad completely changed his appearance as\nif he were wearing a layer of shadow\narmor. Long and sharp spikes grew from\nthe joints of the armor as well as from\nhis hands and feet. Two thick shadow\nhorns also grew from his helmet. He was\nlike a demon king emerging from the\nshadows. The shadows continued to pour\nin and his body began to grow taller\ninch by inch, 2 m, 3 m. Holy crap,\ncelestial venerable, this brat is going\nto fight me to the death. Divine Envoy,\ndo you even have any lifespan left?\nQuickly, give me some more or I won't be\nable to control him. Master Shinshing\nexclaimed inwardly. Sumu naturally\nwouldn't let the two fight to the death.\nIf they were both seriously injured,\nthen the subsequent plans would be\nimpossible to carry out. He hasn't fully\nabsorbed the shadow energy yet. Attack\nhim now, and I'll cooperate with you.\nUpon receiving the instruction, Master\nShinshing no longer hesitated. His\nlifespan burned wildly, and the dazzling\nsword light tore apart the shadow orbs\nblocking his way, attacking Yin Moxy\nlike a ghost. He had to break through\nthe shadow armor before the opponent was\nfully formed, or else things would get\ncomplicated. A ray of blue light burst\nforth from the tip of the sword, like\nthe rising sun, instantly radiating\nboundless light and dispelling the\nsurrounding shadows. Yan Moxy\nmanipulated the surrounding shadow\nenergy and the dark ribbons floating in\nmidair attacked wildly immediately\nhindering Shiinqing Daists movements.\nJust as the opponent's transformation\nwas about to be fully completed at this\ncrucial moment, Sumu activated his\nendless demonic sound. He approached Yan\nMoxy and used the endless demonic voice\ndirectly into the others ear to simulate\nthe sea god's murmur. Buzz, evil,\ndepravity, and ominousness.\nIndescribable, terrifying whispers\nexploded in Yin Moxy s ears, who\npossesses the divinity of the sea god\ncan be said to have the most realistic\nmimicry of the delirium in the world.\nCaught off guard, Yin Moxy was struck\nhead-on by the sea god's murmur. His\nmind instantly went blank. The thousands\nof shadow energy bands he had been\ncontrolling immediately collapsed, and\neven the shadow energy covering his body\nbriefly stagnated. However, Yin Moxy\nregained his senses in just a moment.\nBut in a battle between masters, a\nslight mistake can lead to a huge\ndifference in outcome, and a moment of\ndistraction can be the key to victory or\ndefeat. Shianing, the old towist, seized\nthe opportunity. His long sword, glowing\nwith azure light, slashed through the\nsky, and at the moment when the shadow\nenergy stopped flowing, he thrust his\nsword into the gap into thick shadow\narmor. That was the sound of a long\nsword piercing flesh. Chapter 197.\nUncle, this won't do either. The\nswirling shadow energy slowly receded,\nand the tangible darkness around them\nreturned to calm. Crimson blood flowed\nfrom Yen Moxy's abdomen. Lu gracefully\nsheathed his sword, performed a sword\nflourish, and then put the long sword\nback into its sheath. Uncle, you're not\ngood enough for this. You've lived to be\nthis old for nothing. Master Shinshing\nshook his head in disappointment,\nseemingly feeling that the battle just\nnow was not enough. Yanmoxy clutched the\nwound on his abdomen, his palms soaked\nwith blood. The wound wasn't deep,\nclearly because Master Shinshing had\nshown mercy. Otherwise, taking advantage\nof his momentary lapse in concentration,\nthe other party could have easily\npierced his body with a single sword\nstrike. His face showed no\ndisappointment after defeat, only\nheaviness. Victory and defeat are common\noccurrences in war, and he was not so\nintolerant of losing, even though the\ndefeat was somewhat unjust. If it\nweren't for the strange sound that\nsuddenly rang in his ears, he would have\nalready revealed all his trump cards,\nand the outcome would have been\nuncertain. However, a loss is a loss.\nJust because you have a trump card\ndoesn't mean you don't have lust.\nJudging from the fact that lust hasn't\nbeen fully satisfied, there must be some\npowerful trump card hidden. Even if you\nrelease it completely, you might not be\nable to win if you really fight. All\nright, we can't expect too much from\nmiddle-aged and elderly people. Let's\njust say you barely passed, Master\nShinshin casually picked at his ear wax\nand flicked it into the distance. Thank\nyou, Yanmoxy said in a deep voice. Then\ntell us how your revolutionary army\nplans to cooperate with the seven deadly\nsins. It would be best to stir up some\nbig events. We don't have time to play\nhouse with you. Master Shinshing seemed\nto have gotten into the swing of things\nand his tone became increasingly\narrogant. Rest assured, I will\nabsolutely not disappoint you. However,\nthis is a very important matter, and I\nhope to have a face-to-face meeting with\nyour excellency. Tell me what it is, and\nI'll consider whether to inform the\nleader. If it's a minor matter, I can\nmake the decision myself. Yanmoxy took a\ndeep breath and said solemnly, \"Kill the\nnobles of the capital?\" \"What? Kill\nnobles in the capital?\" Master Shinshing\nwas suddenly shocked. He hadn't expected\nthe revolutionary army to be so\naudacious now. Killing marginal nobles\nwasn't enough. They even wanted to go to\nthe capital to kill nobles. After his\ninitial exclamation, he realized he had\nlost his composure, so he sneered. Huh?\nI thought it was something important,\nkilling a few nobles. Why would you need\nto cooperate with us? Yin Moxy was taken\naback, gaining a deeper understanding of\nthe lawlessness of the seven deadly\nsins. Was killing nobles in the capital\na trivial matter? If this were between\nnations and another country killed a\ncore noble of the Crimson Flame Empire,\nit would essentially be a fight to the\ndeath and both empires would be engulfed\nin a full-scale war. For some reason,\nthe revolutionary army cannot carry out\nthe killing of nobles on its own. So, it\nhopes that the seven deadly sins can\nhelp. Your excellency lust can rest\nassured that the reward will be very\ngenerous. Master Shining sneered. Sumu\nhad already analyzed the revolutionary\narmy's objectives with him before. For\nsome reason, they clearly wanted to use\nthe seven deadly sins to draw the\nempires firepower and take the\nopportunity to eliminate some nobles who\nstood firmly on the side of the royal\nfamily. Uncle, don't treat everyone like\nfools. Your revolutionary army's goal is\nnothing more than to have the seven\ndeadly sins eliminate dissident for you.\nThe revolutionary army has grown so\npowerful because there must be people\namong the nobles in the capital. But\nbecause of the unspoken rule that nobles\ncannot be killed, you want to use the\nseven deadly sins to eliminate the\nroyalist nobles, right? Yin Moxy's heart\nsank. He hadn't expected that the\nlustful man, who appeared to be a\nteenager, would have such sharp eyes,\nseeing through the revolutionary army's\nplans at a glance. He simply admitted,\n\"That's right. But this doesn't cause\nany loss to the seven deadly sins\nbecause you've already killed a nobleman\nand are now locked in a life or death\nstruggle with the Crimson Flame Empire.\nYou're even ranked higher on the wanted\nlist than the Revolutionary Army.\nKilling another nobleman won't hurt you.\nAnd the Revolutionary Army will give you\na reward that will satisfy you. What\nkind of reward? Master Shinshiing, who\nhad just lost a bottle of gold potion,\nwas more concerned about this. Yanmoxy\nEsbrow twitched somewhat surprised. Was\nthis the power of the seven deadly sins?\nThey didn't care who they killed at all,\nas if it didn't matter who they killed,\nonly the price. Royal treasure. Upon\nhearing these four words, Su Mu frowned\nslightly because he had no idea what a\nroyal treasure was. Fortunately, Master\nShinshing, having lived to such an old\nage, was indeed very knowledgeable. \"You\npossess royal treasures,\" Daist Shian\nasked with suspicion. \"If you truly did,\nwould you be being chased by the Crimson\nFlame Empire?\" Besides, even if you did\npossess them, why would you offer such\ntreasures for trade? We do have the\nroyal treasure, but it is incomplete. As\nyou said, if we had the complete royal\ntreasure, the revolutionary army would\nnot be in this situation now. At this\nmoment, Sumu transmitted his voice,\n\"What is the royal treasure?\" Master\nShinshing quickly replied in his mind,\n\"Divine Envoy, the royal power treasure\nis the most powerful treasure in the\nworld. You know the seven kings, right?\nThe royal power treasure is an\nunparalleled divine weapon created by\nthe seven kings with the full power of\ntheir nation. Rumor has it that the\nreason the seven kings were able to\nbecome kings and crush all the gold\nlevel powerhouses was largely because of\ntheir royal treasures which were divine\nweapons that surpassed the gold level\nand were above the gold level treasures.\nThe royal treasures are the national\ntreasures of the seven great empires.\nThe seven king's weapons. Sumu's eyes\nflickered slightly. A hint of interest\npeaked. He hadn't expected such an\nunexpected surprise. However, he also\nknew very well that the royal treasures\nYan Moxy could produce wouldn't be too\npowerful. Otherwise, the other party\nwouldn't have used them for the trade.\nAs far as I know, the seven royal\ntreasures should all be in the hands of\nthe various royal families. So, why do\nyou possess them? Master Shinshing\nasked, his eyes slightly narrowed. Most\nof the royal treasures are indeed in the\nhands of the royal families of the major\nempires. But the sword of the dragon\nabyss empire is now only in its\nscabbard. Master Shinshing was startled.\nYou possess the sword of royal power?\nYin Moxy shook his head. As I said, it\nis a fragment of the royal power\ntreasure. The royal power sword was\nshattered during the war of the seven\nkings a 100 years ago. Those fragments\nfell into the hands of different forces.\nIn order to recreate the royal power\nsword, they added many rare materials to\ntheir respective fragments and finally\nforged 12 swords, which were later\ncalled the 12 swords of royal power. We\nonly possess one of them. Legend has it\nthat if all 12 swords of the king's\npower are collected, the glory of the\nking's power sword can be restored. It's\nimportant to know that the dragon king\nof the Luan Empire is revered as the\nworld's strongest being and also the\nmost powerful among the seven kings.\nTherefore, his sword of kingship is\nconsidered the world's greatest\ntreasure. Master Shinshing s breathing\nquickened as he listened. What a\ntreasure. Your excellency lust. This is\nthe greatest sincerity our revolutionary\narmy can offer. The 12 swords of royal\npower are distributed among the seven\ngreat empires, and we simply do not have\nthe resources to collect them all right\nnow. Otherwise, we would never have\noffered this treasure as a reward.\nChapter 198. Bronze immortal emperor\nSumu. Master Shinshing suddenly sneered.\nIt's not just that we don't have the\nenergy to collect them, it's that we\ndon't. The sword of kingship is a\nheirloom of the Dragon Abyss Empire.\nWhoever takes down the 12 swords of\nkingship will become a potential enemy\nof the Dragon Abyss Empire. Yin Moxy\nnodded. That makes sense, but I believe\nthe seven deadly sins shouldn't care. I\ndon't care. That's the Dragon Abyss\nEmpire, the world's number one\nsuperpower. Say yes, Sumu said calmly.\nMaster Shinshqing immediately said\nproudly, \"That's right. The seven deadly\nsins are indeed not a concern. Then I\nwould like to trouble your excellency,\nlust to invite the arrogant leader to\nappear for a discussion.\" \"Wait.\" Master\nShinshing began to pretend to close his\neyes, his lips moving slightly as he\nuttered incantations that were barely\naudible. A moment later, a figure in\nblack appeared out of thin air next to\nlust. \"Your excellency arrogance,\"\nYanmoxy said respectfully. His attitude\nwas much better than the first time they\nmet because he had already categorized\narrogance in his mind as someone on the\nsame level as the leader of the\nrevolutionary army. Only someone like a\ncommander could control these powerful\ngold level warriors under his command. I\nalready know what happened now. Tell me,\nwho do you want to kill? Sumu said\nindifferently. Yan Moxy glanced around\nwearily before whispering. Gong Kuan,\nthe cabinet minister of the capital.\nThis man has not awakened his bloodline\nand is an ordinary person, but he is\nunparalleled in wisdom and strategy,\ndeeply trusted by the royal family and\nholds a high position and great power.\nHe is the commanderin-chief of the\nsecret guards and has repeatedly\nbesieged the revolutionary army, causing\nus heavy losses. I humbly request your\nexcellency to take action. An ordinary\nperson? The arrogant voice turned cold,\nand those disdainful eyes looked at Yin\nMoxy. You went to great lengths to find\nme and in the end you only wanted to\nkill a piece of trash. Suddenly the\natmosphere froze and a powerful sense of\noppression emanated from Amen. Yen Moxy\ns body stiffened and he felt as if he\nwere a mortal standing on a stormy sea.\nMomentum is a very subtle thing. It has\nnothing to do with strength but is\nentirely a psychological pressure. Take\nancient emperors for example. They were\njust ordinary people who needed to eat,\ndrink and relieve themselves. Yet when\nthe common people saw the emperor, they\nfelt nothing but awe. And the timid ones\ncouldn't even utter a word. For example,\na child who fails an exam and comes home\nto find his father sitting silently on\nthe sofa. These are all manifestations\nof momentum. Yanmoxy now had this\nfeeling. He felt as if he were facing a\nterrifyingly powerful figure who was\ninvincible and had the whole world under\nhis feet. That arrogant and disdainful\ngaze made cold sweat break out on his\nforehead. He couldn't even begin to\nimagine what kind of immense power it\nwould take to cultivate such a\nterrifying aura. This is the aura unique\nto the bronze immortal emperor Sumu.\nEven though he may be a bronze level\nperson, he still dares to think and\ndream. The power of aura only works when\nothers have a preconceived notion of\nyou. To put it bluntly, the other party\nmust first know your identity and\nrecognize that you are powerful before\nthe effect of aura can be multiplied.\nOtherwise, no matter how imposing a\nbeggar on the street may appear, others\nwill only think that the beggar is\nputting on heirs. But if someone were to\nsay that this beggar was once a\nbillionaire who later gave away all his\nwealth to charity, you would feel awe\nand respect for him, thinking that he\nhad an extraordinary presence. Your\nexcellency, although Gong Kuan is just\nan ordinary person, he has many experts\naround him, Yan Moxy explained in a\nslightly hurried tone. Shut up. Sumu\nsnorted coldly, causing Yin Moxy to stop\ntalking involuntarily. The seven deadly\nsins wouldn't lower themselves to such a\npoint as to go to such lengths to attack\nan ordinary person. The revolutionary\narmy has really disappointed me.\nCooperation is terminated. After saying\nthat, Sumu and Daist Shinshing turned to\nleave. Yin Moxy immediately looked\nanxious. This time, he had witnessed the\nstrength of the seven deadly sins and\nlearned about his own strength. If the\ncooperation failed, it would be a huge\nloss. You arrogant sir, please wait. He\nhurly stepped forward and blocked their\npath. Sumu glanced at him disdainfully\nand said only one word. Get lost. His\nbehavior perfectly matched the arrogant\npersona, bringing that arrogance to\nlife. The tauist priest, Shianshin,\nstanding to the side, readily drew his\nlong sword. A brilliant blue light rose\nslowly from his body, and the powerful\nair pressure caused a sudden gust of\nwind. Tiny white wisps of air even\nappeared beneath his feet, and the\nsurrounding grass was blown about\nwildly. Yanmoxy's heart sank. Despite\nthe pressure from the two seven deadly\nsins, he forced himself to say, \"Your\nexcellency, we sincerely want to\ncooperate with your organization. If you\nfeel that killing an ordinary person is\nbeneath your dignity, then we can\ndiscuss it further. In the capital, we\nhave many targets we want to eliminate,\nincluding some powerful nobles. These\nare all negotiable.\" He spoke very\nquickly as if afraid the other party\nwould lose patience and take action.\nAfter listening, Sumu stopped and said\nindifferently, \"We don't accept orders\nbelow the gold standard.\" \"What?\" Yan\nMoxy was shocked again. He had lost\ncount of how many times he had been\nshocked, but the Seven Deadly Sins\norganization had indeed given him too\nmany shocks. We won't accept orders\nbelow the gold level. Doesn't that mean\nwe Seven Deadly Sins only kill gold\nlevel powerhouses? This isn't just\narrogance. It's downright lawlessness.\nNo wonder the seven deadly sins dared to\nkill nobles in public. Now it seems\nthey've become much more restrained in\ndoing so. To understand that the entire\nCrimson Flame Empire only has a few\ndozen gold level experts. Competition\nbetween empires is essentially a contest\nof the number of gold level experts.\nEach gold level expert is a pillar of\nthe empire and their death would cause a\ntsunami-like upheaval. Yet the seven\ndeadly sins only kill gold level\nexperts. Yanmoxy took a deep breath,\nsuppressing his shock, and said with a\nhint of difficulty, \"Your Excellency, I\nneed to discuss this matter with the\ncommander.\" They originally only wanted\nto use the seven deadly sins to divert\nthe Empire's attention and kill some\nnobles. They thought the incident was\nserious enough, but who would have\nthought that Pride would openly talk\nabout killing gold saints? The\nconsequences of such a blatant act were\nimmeasurable for the revolutionary army.\n\"You mean you want me to wait for you?\"\nSumu's indifferent voice struck Yin\nMoxy's heart like a thunderclap. Your\nhighness, we really need to discuss\nthis, Yanmoxy said through gritted\nteeth. Gold level experts are very\ndifficult to kill. They hold high\npositions and great power in the capital\nand are surrounded by countless guards.\nIf the battle cannot be resolved in a\nshort time, they will be besieged, which\nis too risky. He said this not only to\nwarn Sumu of the risks, but more\nimportantly, he was worried that if the\nseven deadly sins were to be defeated\nand captured when they went to the\ncapital to kill the gold level experts\nand then revealed the revolutionary\narmy, it would be a devastating blow to\nthe revolutionary army. Sumu's lips\ncurled slightly. Have you forgotten?\nThere is a gold level expert who is not\ncurrently in the capital. Chapter 199,\nthe seven deadly sins. Gluttony. Yan\nMoxy as pupils suddenly contracted. See\nKung Xan. Sumu smiled and nodded. Since\nhe has the courage to investigate the\nseven deadly sins, he should naturally\nbe prepared to die. To tell you the\ntruth, whether or not your revolutionary\narmy exists, we will definitely kill\nSeong Xan. Now that you've come to me of\nyour own accord, I'll just have to take\none of the 12 swords of Wong Kuan while\nI'm at it and then go kill Seungjan. In\nshort, with Seek Kong Xhan&lt;unk&gt;s death,\nthe Crimson Flame Empire has lost a gold\nlevel powerhouse, which is also\nbeneficial to your revolutionary army.\nYin Moxy stiffened, a forced smile\nappearing on his face. After hearing the\narrogant words, he suddenly felt that he\nhad been taken advantage of. You won't\nreig on your promise, right? Yan Moxy as\nsmile grew increasingly stiff. After a\nmoment, he said, \"Since we have already\nagreed, we will never go back on our\nword.\" Ha. Sumu chuckled contemptuously.\nThen hand over one of the 12 swords of\nroyal power first. Yen Moxy chuckled\ndryly. I don't carry that sword with me.\nIt's&lt;unk&gt; in the hands of the commander.\nPlease rest assured the 12 swords of\nWong Kuan will be presented to you with\nboth hands after the matter is\naccomplished. Since that's the case, why\ndon't you get involved in this matter? I\ndon't really trust the character of your\nrevolutionary army, and I seriously\ndoubt whether you'll back out after it's\nall over. The seven deadly sins will\nthen bear the wrath of the Crimson Flame\nEmpire and will have no time to\nextricate themselves. If you go back on\nyour word, we won't have time to come\nafter you either. So, I can only feel at\nease if we're all in the same boat. Yan\nMoxy sart skipped a beat. Oh no, they\nwere about to get on a pirate ship.\nTheir purpose in finding the seven\ndeadly sins was to make them share the\nempire's anger. If the revolutionary\narmy also got involved, wouldn't they be\nshooting themselves in the foot? Sumu\nseemed to see through Yan Moxy's\nthoughts and sneered. Don't worry, I\nwon't let you show your true face. Since\nyour goal is to make the Seven Deadly\nSins draw attention to you, you can\npretend to be a member of the Seven\nDeadly Sins. As long as you send the 12\nswords of kingship after the deed is\ndone, then we'll be fine. Otherwise, I\nwill make this public and let the whole\nworld know that Deputy Commander Yen of\nthe Revolutionary Army is one of the\nseven deadly sins and participated in\nthe murder of Siong Xan. Yin Moxy's\nheart sank. The other party had already\ngone this far. If he still refused\ntoday, he would probably die before\nSikong did. \"All right,\" he nodded. \"I\nwonder how many people your excellency\nplans to send this time, or are you\ngoing to take action personally?\" Sumu\nsaid calmly. \"My true form is not in\nStar City. The only seven deadly sins\nnearby are envy and lust. Those two are\nenough. Now that you're here, if the\nthree gold level experts still can't\nkill Sung Xan, then you might as well\njust commit suicide. Master Shinshing\ncomplained from the side. Leader, why\nbring that jealous guy here? I can\nhandle Seong Xan on my own. Shut up. I\nhave my own plans. Master Shinshing\nshrank back in fear, not daring to speak\nagain, and began drawing circles with\nhis hands, looking agrieved. Yanmoxy,\nstanding to the side, was shocked.\nAnother gold level expert. Arrogance is\ngold. Lust is gold. And now there's even\njealousy. He's increasingly convinced of\nthe rumor about the seven deadly sins.\nSeven people and seven pieces of gold.\nDeputy Commander Yen, let lust tell you\nthe specific plan. I hope you won't\ndisappoint me. After saying that, the\narrogant figure slowly became\ntransparent until it disappeared\ncompletely. It's that same trick again.\nNo matter how many times I watch it, I\ncan't see any clues. Yan Moxy frowned,\nstaring at the spot where Su Mu had\ndisappeared. At this moment, Master\nShihin came over and patted Yan Moxy on\nthe shoulder. Hey, uncle, don't hold me\nback later. Hearing Lust's innocent\nvoice, Yin Moxy's heart stirred. Lust\nwas young, and perhaps he could obtain\nmore information about the seven deadly\nsins from him. Your excellency, Lust,\nYour Excellency, Pride, just told me to\npretend to be one of the seven deadly\nsins. So, tell me, who should I pretend\nto be? Of course, it's gluttony. Master\nShinshing pulled out a silver white mask\nwith a wideopen mouth as if it were\nswallowing food from his bosom and\nhanded it to Yan Moxy. Yin Moxy was\ntaken aback. Why gluttony? Because\nthere's only one gluttony position left\nin our organization. The leader gave\nevery member a gluttony mask so we could\nfind a new member. So, you can play the\nrole of gluttony for now. As he said\nthis, Master Shining suddenly leaned\nclose to Yan Moxy's ear mysteriously.\nLet me tell you a secret. The people in\nthe organization have bad tempers and\noften start fighting over the slightest\ndisagreement. Only the arrogant boss can\nkeep them in check. So, you'd better not\nimpersonate them or they'll definitely\ncause you trouble. Yin Moxy's eyes\nflickered. The seven deadly sins are\ndivided. It seems they are only united\nby their arrogance and strength. This\ninformation is very important. Perhaps\nwe can use this to turn some of the\nseven deadly sins to join the\nrevolutionary army in the future. He\nsneered inwardly. Although this lustful\none was powerful, he was still too\nyoung. It seemed that he could extract\nmore information from him. Your\nexcellency lust. What kind of person is\njealousy? Don't misunderstand. I don't\nmean anything by it. It's just that the\nthree of you s are going to act together\nand I want to find out about him in\nadvance to avoid any unnecessary\ntrouble. Jealous of him. Old tauist\nShianing put his hands behind his head\nand stretched his body saying he is a\nvery strange person. He is very\nwithdrawn, doesn't like to talk, and has\npale skin, just like a mouse that hides\nin the dark all day without seeing the\nsun. So when you see him, you'd better\npay less attention to him. You wouldn't\nbelieve it, but once he got into a fight\nwith someone who was furious, and you'd\nnever guess why they started fighting.\nWhy did they fight? Yan Moxy played the\nrole of a good straight man in order to\ngather intelligence. Master Shinshing\nchuckled just because he spoke a few\nmore words to him in a fit of rage. He\nbecame jealous and thought that the\nrage's voice sounded better than his\nown. He was deliberately showing off and\nthen the two of them started fighting.\nYan Moxy was stunned. What kind of\nridiculous reason was this? They\nactually fought over something like\nthis. Was this jealousy insane? Do you\nalso think that jealousy is a sign of\nmental illness? He has quite a\npersonality. He has no personality\nwhatsoever. He's just a lunatic. He even\ngot into a fight with me once just\nbecause he was jealous that I'm younger\nthan him. By the way, your excellency\nlost. If Wrath and Envy were to fight,\nwho would win? Neither of them won. The\ntwo had just gotten really into a fight\nwhen the arrogant boss stopped them. It\nseems Lord Arrogance has been quite busy\nlately. Yanmoxy replied casually, but\nhis heart was in turmoil. Another gold\nlevel expert. Jealousy is gold, so so\nmust the fury that can ignite a real\nfire between him. Based on this, there\nare currently six members of the seven\ndeadly sins, and all six should be gold\nlevel powerhouses. Chapter 230 and\nStanding Firm. Six gold level warriors.\nTheir strength surpasses that of the\nRevolutionary Army. Damn it. Where did\nthese six gold level experts come from?\nYin Moxy s mind raced, but he couldn't\nfigure it out at all. Gold level experts\nweren't like cabbages. They weren't\nsomething you could just find anywhere.\nFor any empire, gold ranked warriors are\ntruly strategic weapons. The number of\ngold ranked warriors a country has is\nbasically a measure of its strength.\nThere's even a popular saying that a\ncountry needs 30 gold level experts to\nestablish itself internationally and\nqualify as an empire. This is called\nestablishing oneself at 30. Similarly,\nif a country has 40 gold level experts,\nthen there is nothing in the world that\ncan confuse it. This is called being\nfree from confusion at 40. At 50, one\nknows the mandate of heaven. Means that\nwhen a country has 50 gold level\nexperts, other countries will know who\nthe true mandate of heaven is. At 60,\none's ears are attuned to the truth.\nWith 60 golden level experts, whatever\nthis empire says will sound perfectly\npleasing to other empires. The saying,\n\"At 70, one can do as one pleases\nwithout transgressing the rules,\"\nbecomes easier to understand. With 70\ngold level powerhouses, the empire has\nthe capital to do whatever it wants, and\nno other empire dares to violate the\nrules you set. Although it's just a\nnickname used by the public, it also\nreflects the weight of a gold level\nexpert. That's why Yin Moxy was so\nshocked. Six gold level experts could\nestablish a small country if they were\noutside. Just as Yin Moxy was in shock,\nMaster Shinshing said again, \"Hey,\nUncle, don't just stand there in a days.\nI'm about to explain the battle plan, so\nbe serious.\" \"Oh, okay.\" Yin Moxy paused\nfor a moment, forcibly suppressing the\nchaotic thoughts in his mind, and\nlistened attentively. Master Shinshin\nchuckled and said, \"This battle plan is\nquite interesting. It's a trap set by\nthe seven deadly sins specifically for\nSeong Xan. He's been looking for us, so\nwe decided to turn the tables and let\nhim find us. How do we get him to find\nus? By showing ourselves and then luring\nSeongjin out. Moxy a disdainful look. Do\nyou think Seong Xin would fall for such\na simple plan? Don't treat others like\nfools. Yan Moxy clenched his fists. If\nhe weren't wary of Lust's powerful\nstrength, he really wanted to give this\nbrat a good beating. His words were so\nunpleasant to hear. A truly brilliant\nplan is one that lures the enemy into a\ntrap. People may doubt clues that are\nhanded to them willingly, but they will\nnever doubt clues that they have\npainstakingly found themselves.\nUnderstand? I don't understand. In order\nto get more information from Lust, Yin\nMoxy could only suppress his displeasure\nand play the straight man. Hey, I knew\nthat old man wouldn't understand. It\nhardened. Yan Moxy's fist hardened.\nMaster Shinshing said smuggly. I won't\nkeep you in suspense any longer. I'll\njust tell you directly. See Kong Xhan\ncouldn't find any clues about the seven\ndeadly sins. So, he wanted to use\nsupernatural powers to find them by\npredicting the future. For seeing the\nfuture, Yin Moxy was shocked. He hadn't\nexpected the Crimson Flame Empire to\nhave such a hidden method. If it were\nused against the Revolutionary Army, the\nRevolutionary Army would probably be in\ngrave danger. He couldn't help but feel\nfortunate that the revolutionary army\nhadn't dared to kill nobles before,\nallowing the Crimson Flame Empire to\nfocus its energy on the Blood Moon\nEmpire, which was its external enemy.\nUnfortunately, the arrogant boss saw\nthrough it and deliberately gave Seong\nJean a false vision of the future to\nlure him into the trap. What? Yanmoxy\ncould hardly believe his ears. He\nconsidered himself a gold level expert\nand the deputy commander of the\nRevolutionary Army, and he had seen it\nall. But the combination of words used\nby lust was truly challenging his\nimagination. Can the ability to foresee\nthe future and even see through it and\nto provide incorrect visions of the\nfuture? How is this possible? If\npredicting the future involves the realm\nof time, does arrogance also possess the\nability to interfere with time? He\nlearned about the seven deadly sins, the\nmore unfathomable pride seemed to him.\nYour excellency, I must confess, I don't\nquite understand, but can the future\nalso be forged? Master Shianing glanced\nat him and said indifferently, \"Just\nbecause others can't doesn't mean that\nBoss Aommen can't. Don't ask too many\nquestions. Just follow my lead when the\ntime comes.\" After the two left, Sumu\nappeared out of thin air. He walked to\nthe place where Yan Moxy and Dais\nShining had fought and examined the\nblood stains on the ground. That was the\nblood that flowed from Yan Moxy after he\nwas injured. The reason he wanted to see\nthe blood wasn't actually because he\nwanted to see it, but because it wasn't\nwhite. After a period of unlimited\nspiritual nourishment, Bubai has grown\nstrong and his communication has become\nclearer like a toddler learning to\nspeak. While watching the two fight in\nthe dream, Bubai saw Yin Moxy transform\ninto a shadow monster and felt a strange\nreaction. But Sumu was helping Master\nShinshing fight at the time, so he\nignored it. When they asked Bubai again,\nBubai conveyed a very interesting\nmessage. \"No, you mean Yan Moxy is from\nthe same clan as you?\" Sumu asked. Bubai\nimmediately expressed a negative emotion\nand his chaotic thoughts continued to\nintertwine. It took Sumu quite a while\nto understand what Buouai wanted to\nexpress. You mean you and Yin Moxy are\ninto the same race and your race is the\nshadow demon? This time I received a\npositive response from Bubai. Sumu was\nslightly surprised. The golden law\nshadow demon was clearly a law. So how\ndid it become a fellow clan of Bubai?\nAlthough both sides used the power of\nshadow, how could a nightmare monster in\na lobby be of the same kind, Bouai tried\nto express himself in a babbling manner,\nbut this time Sumu couldn't understand\nhim? Because Bouai was saying a long\nstring of words. He tried to guess based\non the few words he could understand and\ngradually formed some ideas in his mind,\nbut he couldn't verify them for the time\nbeing. You want Yin Moxy's blood? Would\nit help you? Bubai emerged from\nSumu&lt;unk&gt;s shadow, transforming into a\n5-meter tall shadow monster and nodded\nvigorously. Okay, go get it. Sumu nodded\nin agreement. Bouai immediately extended\nhis shadowy hand, his slender, sharp\nfingertips touching the dark red blood\nstains on the ground. Instantly, like a\nstraw, he drew out all the blood and\nabsorbed it into his body. After doing\nall this, Bubai returned to Su Mu's\nshadow and sent a message saying that he\nneeded to sleep for a while. Under Sum\nMu&lt;unk&gt;s coordination, the seemingly\ncalmst star city began to stir with\nundercurrents. He wo a large net behind\nthe scenes, encompassing the three\nforces of the Blood Clan, the\nRevolutionary Army, and the Crimson\nFlame Empire. The powerful figures they\neach represented were unknowingly drawn\ninto the game, becoming pawns on the\nchessboard. 2 days later, Lord Blood\nAbyss, this is the jealousy mask I\nprepared for you, and the Seven Deadly\nSinstyle tuxedo. Murang Yun respectfully\nheld up the clothes and mask and handed\nthem to Blood Abyss."
