      "transcript": "Hello and welcome back to the Wisconsin\nGravel Cyclist. This is your host Logan.\nToday we're going over the Bear 100\nHoney Bear route. This is my first race\nof the year for 2025 and it was held in\nLeon, Wisconsin. Here we are at the\nstart. Um there were, you know, a great\namount of people that came here for this\nevent. In the 31 mile race that I\nparticipated in, there are about\n140. We started off right in town at a\nlocal bar and we started on this just\nlocal walking in ATV UTV trail that had\nall kinds of bad black top and stuff all\nover it. But it was a very\nnice, you know, flat, easy start to the\nrace here for the bare 131 mile race a\nlittle, right?\nUh at the start here, we really weren't\ngoing very hard at all. We were just\nkind of rolling out. Uh this gentleman\nhere, he wanted to try to get the pace\ngoing a little bit faster. So he would,\nyou know, come in front here every once\nin a while and push the pace just a\nlittle bit. But overall, we really\nweren't pushing hard. We were just going\n15 miles an hour or so, 15, 16 m hour\nand just rolling out at the start on\nthis nice path and trail that they had\nhere for the start of the Bear 100 Bear.\nHeat. Heat.\nAnd then eventually uh David here, the\neventual winner of the bear 100 honey\nbear uh came to the front and decided\nthat we needed to get this party\nstarted. So he went to the front and\nstarted to pick up the pace, which was\ngood. At this point, little did we know,\nthere were others that were and weren't\nreally trying to stay with us here at\nthe front. So, uh, David picked up the\npace, you know, 17, 18 miles an hour,\nmaybe a little bit faster on the flats,\nand we just proceeded to start and\nrotate. Uh the two of us here, the other\ngentleman that uh we saw earlier, uh he\njust kind of sat on the back of us and\nyo-yoed a little\nbit. Heat.\n[Music]\nHeat.\nHeat. All\nright.\nAnd then what you see here is what a lot\nof the raceourse was like. It was this\nhard packed dirt road with trees and\nthick cover all around us. There were\nsome times where, you know, we had some\nuphills and different things like that\nand it was a very, very cool atmosphere\nand cool setting for a gravel race here\nin northern Wisconsin.\nthis section here where we start to go\nup some of these hills with the pines\nand birch trees uh here on the sides of\nthe road. Uh this is honestly one of my\nfavorite parts of the course. It's just\nbeautiful and really accentuates what\nyou know Wisconsin has to offer for\ngravel riding. Um these roads I would\nsay overall decent condition. Uh they\ndid have a fair amount of rain here the\nnight before. So, the roads were rather\nwet and sticky and at times a lot of\npotholes and puddles and things like\nthat. That did make it a little\ninteresting at times trying to avoid uh\nyou know trying to avoid those potholes\nand and puddles and things like\nthat. Eventually, it was just David and\nI. we were able to kind of break away\nfrom the rest of the group and a couple\nof the other riders\nand we just worked on and off together\nfor pretty much the remainder of the\nrace here. Um, at times, you know, if it\nwas a a hill or something like we're\nseeing here, he would gap me off a\nlittle bit. This was my first race of\nthe year. Didn't quite have the miles in\nthat I was expecting, but really I was\nfeeling pretty good.\nThat's weird.\nyou know, and at that point, just when\nwe thought we had uh left everyone kind\nof behind us, uh we found ourselves on a\nflat section here coming off of a\ndownhill. And our buddy in the hooded\nsweatshirt joins us here shortly.\nUnfortunately, we couldn't get him to do\nmuch work for us, though. He kind of\njust wanted to ride off to the side or\nbehind us and wouldn't, you know, give\nmuch of a draft or anything like that.\nSo, we kind of just uh got to a point\nwhere I would catch back up with David\non the flat sections like we see here,\nand David and I would end up working\ntogether again.\nAnd then eventually, you know, there\nwere a few road sections on this course.\nUm, none of them were were real very\nlong. It was definitely more gravel\nthan road in this race. Um, in this case\nhere, I'm on the front setting the tempo\nof the of the of the race. At this\npoint, it is truly just David and I at\nthe front. And we're working our way\ntowards the Bear Lake Campground here up\nby Lake Elmo,\nWisconsin.\nUpon entering the road into the\ncampground, this road was very flowy and\nfast. And again,\nthe typical uh birch and spruce trees\nthat you see here in northern Wisconsin\nin a little bit of lowland. Um, you'll\nsee here, I don't know if it shows it\noverly well, but the lake will be on our\nleft hand side here in a little bit. Uh,\nand this is actually where uh Brent\nstayed uh when he was coming up with the\nidea for the bear. Brent is the uh race\ndirector here for the Bear 100. And you\nknow, overall, this was a great event.\nVery well organized, lots of door\nprizes, good food. Um, you know, it's\nwhat you want to see in a gravel race. I\nhighly recommend getting the Bear 100,\nwhether it's the Honey Bear, you know,\nor the, you know, the actual 100mile\nversion of the Bear. I highly recommend\nyou get up to Leona to give this race a\ntry. So, again, we're going through, you\nknow, the campground route here. We turn\nleft and continue. Um, this was all\npaved and this is one of the faster\nsections of the course actually. Um, we\nwere able to roll pretty good in here.\nYou'll see here I get a little bit hot\nand heavy as we're going through here\nand I actually miss a turn. Uh,\nfortunately David's an honest guy and he\nwas able to redirect me and get me back\non course. So there were no unfair\nadvantages for anyone in this race.\nAnd then one of the final sections of\nthe race here was the Rat River Trail,\nwhich at this point I was starting to\nfeel really really tired. Um, again, I\nhadn't had many miles in my legs at all\nthis year at this point in time. So, I\nwent on the front and kind of just tried\nto slow things down a little bit. Um,\nthis trail again, they had had a lot of\nrain here over the last couple days, so\nthere was a lot of water on the trail\nand it was very, very soft and muddy in\nplaces on the Rat River Trail here. Uh,\nthis is very uh cool, unique trail. um\nthey had a lot of um trees and sticks\nand things on the course uh because of\nthe rain and wind and things that had\ncame through, you know, just general\nweather patterns here in Wisconsin in\nthe spring.\nUm but overall, the trail was in good\npretty good\ncondition. So again, I kept the pace\nslower here just to give myself a\nchance. Uh, I knew if I could keep it\nslower, I had a potential to to win the\nrace in a sprint. At this point, we\nwere, you know,\n25, 26, 27 miles into the race with only\na couple miles left on the Red River\nTrail here before we got to the end.\nAnd eventually It got to a point where I\nthink David got a little tired of going\nslower than what I wanted to in this. He\nended up uh coming around me here and\njust stayed steady. Unfortunately, I\ndidn't have any answer for this. There\nwere a couple trees and things that we\nhad to go over, but it didn't slow him\ndown any. Unfortunately, I just wasn't\nable to keep this pace with the lack of\nmiles in the legs and lack of intensity.\nSo, at this point, this is where I last\nsaw David uh in the race on the Grat\nRiver\nTrail. Uh I want to say congratulations\nto David. It was great to ride with you.\nI appreciate it. Um hopefully we'll be\nable to uh replicate this duel again\nnext year. So, again, this is Logan with\nthe Wisconsin Gravel Cyclist, uh with\nthe overview of the Honey Bear, a part\nof the Bear 100 in Lyon, Wisconsin.\nAgain, I would highly recommend this\nrace. I had a great day. I got second\nplace overall, first in my division to\nthis point in my career. My best ever\ngravel result. I'm super happy with\nthis. Glad to have been uh able to to\ncome up and give this ride a shot. Um,\nyou know, final final stats were we\naveraged right about 16 miles an hour,\nwhich isn't bad considering everything\nfelt\nlike felt like you were riding on Velcro\nwith the wet wet conditions. So, I'll\nleave you with just a couple pictures of\nthe\num the bib and the placing and results\nhere. Again, wanted to say thank you for\ntuning in to Wisconsin Gravel Cyclist.\nHave a great day. Let's go for a ride.\n2025. Thanks."

I know you can't. I\nshould have picked that glove up. No, I\ndon't got any space to carry stuff. You\ncan't\ntell. But this has all been\nuphill. All this mud has been\nuphill. Morning everybody. Welcome to\nAdam Loose\nAdventure. We're here in sunny Leyona,\nWisconsin. It is a balmy 76\u00b0.\nTotally can't see our breath. I was\ngearing up for a nice long day in the\nsaddle. Got my buddy Dan back here. Say\nhi, Dan. Hi, Dan. You pulling Jamie's\nover here. The trailer thing. Yeah, just\nYeah, I'm pulling Jacob today. Getting\nour stuff together. Yeah, that's going\nto be hard as hell. You know, getting\nready for some mud, some sand. Oh, hi.\nSome\nI don't know. I don't know. What are we\nexpecting today?\nCrab. Crap. Whole lot of crabs. It'll be\ngreat, buddy.\nThank you.\nThree, two, one. Have a great day.\nGo. Good job, everybody.\nTandem. There we go. David and Tanya.\nAll right. Have fun.\nSo, here we are. The Bear\n100 May 3rd, Leyona,\nWisconsin. I tackled the 113 mile\ncourse. wound up to be 115 miles.\nThere's usually a section of what they\ncall ruddy twotrack at the end. Uh\nit's just mud really. It's like an ATV\ntrail with deep, thick, slushy mud. They\ntook it out this year because there was\nan inch of rain a week before the race\nand they said it was not safe,\nwhich seeing the rest of the course, I\ncan say it was the right decision. So,\nthanks guys for looking out for us.\nUm, yeah, this is a tough race. I do not\nquite every year, but I've done it three\ntimes now in the last five years, and\nit's really good primer for the\nseason. Uh, sometimes fun, sometimes\njust brutal.\nUh, this one was definitely towards the\nlatter of those extremes.\nWell, today I wanted to talk to you\nabout five mental strategies that I used\nto not quit this\nrace. Um, you can see at the beginning\nof the race, I'm not doing too bad. Uh,\nstarted off at a my pace, not too fast.\nI didn't go with the fast guys. You can\nsee there's some space between me and\nthe front group yet. I will wind up\ncatching them for a little\nwhile, but I don't stay on too long. Uh,\nit was always my intent to pace this\nreally well and try to work with my\nfriend\nJamie and see how my fitness was.\nWell, it was not where I thought it\nwas, but the real problem\nwas muscular\nuh I don't really know what to call it.\nUm, I was dealing with IT band pain and\nback pain and it\nwas I hesitate to over dramatize it, but\nexcruciating was a pretty good word. Um,\njust searing pain down the sides of my\nthighs and the back pain actually forced\nme off the bike at two points in this\nrace where I just had to get off and\nstretch because I was in so much pain I\ncouldn't sit on the bike anymore.\nSo, I probably wanted to quit for the\nfirst time like nine miles in out of\n115. It was early.\nIt's I want to say it's coming up soon\nhere that I start to be in pain. And\nthen when I catch my buddy Jim\nis when it really started. I rode with\nhim for a while and hammered up a hill\nand it\njust everything went nuts. It was so\nbad. So I started to play things through\nmy head like what what am I going to do?\nCan I really sit with this back pain for\n7 hours, 8 hours? I mean how long am I\ngoing to endure this? and started to\nthink all the usual things about\nquitting\nand failing myself and all this, but I\nnever got down on myself, which I'm\npretty happy about. But here's Jim. I\nwas on his wheel. I this gotten dropped\noff the main group. He caught me.\nI stayed on his wheel for a while and\nyou know we hung out\nbut I just couldn't stick with them\nbecause the pain kept coming\nback.\nAnyway, there's just a lot of stuff that\ngoes through your head when you when you\nthink about quitting a big event. and I\nreally wanted to. It\nwas the prospect of sitting out there\nfor that long in pain was I I just\ndidn't want to do\nit. But then I started to\nreconsider. And like I said, I got five\nthings I want to talk to you about\ntoday. The first\none is to avoid metrics.\nNow, what I mean by\nthis, I'm not talking about not\nmeasuring your\ngoals. Goals you want to have, remember\nthe whole smart acronym, the M is they\nneed to be measurable. So, in order to\nknow if you're achieving something, you\nhave to have a way to measure it. That's\ngood. But when you're in the middle of a\nbig\nevent or something that you need to get\ndone, the last thing you want to do is\nlook at metrics constantly. So, if you\nthink about losing weight, you don't\nwant to really weigh yourself every\nsingle day. The best thing to do is\nprobably weekly because you're going to\nsee so many fluctuations that if you\nweigh yourself every day, you're going\nto see the ups and the downs and it's\nreally easy to get frustrated and\nhonestly give up because you just see\nall these fluctuations and it doesn't\nmake any sense. Why am I why am I three\npounds heavier today? And your body\nholds on to water in certain situations\nand all that stuff. So, it\nyou get bogged down by staring at the\nmetrics. And in this case,\nmileage, distance, speed,\nall that stuff. All it does is distract.\nAnd when you see, oh, I've got 75 miles\nto go. It's really difficult to get your\nbrain away from that distance. All you\ncan focus on is I have this many miles\nto go. So, I turn that screen off.\nIt took me too long this time. I forgot\nabout it, but I switched to my\nnavigation screen only. Which brings me\nto the second of my\nstrategies, break it\ndown. So instead of viewing it as I have\n85 miles to go and I'm in constant pain,\nthink of it as I have the next mile or\nthe next half mile. What I like to do,\nand I remembered it a little later than\nusual in this ride, is to turn on the\nnavigation screen only. And what's\nreally nice about the navigation screen\non the Garmin is that it tells you the\nmileage to your next point. So, it'll\nsay 2.7 miles. Take a left\nonto Rat Rat Lake Road or whatever it\nis. That gives you a small number to\nachieve. And then you get the next turn.\nMaybe that one's only a mile. Maybe the\nnext one is four miles. So each time I\ngot done with one of these sections, I\nthought, \"All right, I just checked four\nmore miles off. I just checked three\nmore miles off.\" And gradually, you get\nto the point where you can't even\nremember how many miles you've actually\ndone. And you start to trick your\nbrain into just not knowing. Like, well,\nI could have 30 miles left or 43 miles\nleft or 27 miles left, but I'm not going\nto look. I don't know. I don't need to\nknow. Just keep that information away.\njust keep it out of your head and then\nit makes it so you don't have to be\ndistracted by it. You It's so much\neasier to just break it down into those\nlittle manageable chunks.\nUm, number\nthree was what saved me on Saturday and\nit's remember that you're not alone.\nNow, in this race, I had people with me\nphysically, and I honestly don't know if\nI would have been able to get into the\nproper headsp space if I hadn't had\nthose people with\nme. But here is what I'm talking about,\neven if there's not people with you. So,\nif I had been on my own, I still could\nhave remembered there's other people out\nhere and they're all suffering. I'm not\nthe only one out here doing this.\nThere's other people here. Whatever\nyou're\ndoing, there's somebody else struggling\nwith it. You're never completely alone.\nYou might think you have this special\nunique problem that no one else has ever\ndealt with. That's a lie. the chances\nthat you have the the only one to have\nexperienced whatever current pain you're\ngoing through is so slim. There's always\nsomebody else who's suffering with you,\neven if they're not physically with you\nat that time. Now, in a race like this,\neven\nif you want to go faster than somebody,\nmaybe it's more valuable to be with\nsomebody if you're in that place of just\nwanting to quit. And for me, that's how\nit was. Um, I had that group of people\nthat you saw me with a little while ago,\nReed, Dave and Tanya, Ferez, and Dylan.\nAnd riding with them gave me hope. It\ngave\nme, how do I describe it? Camaraderie.\nThat's the word I'm looking for. That\nreminder of, yeah, other people are out\nhere doing the same thing. We're all\nhurting a little bit. It's really tough\nout here. I'm not the only one suffering\nin this mud and this soft mushy\nnonsense. So that's such a big deal\nbecause when you isolate yourself, you\nstart to focus on everything that's\nwrong with you and you ignore everybody\nelse and it becomes that much easier to\njust quit. Whereas you think remind\nyourself of all those other people, your\nown situation becomes less\ndire. You don't over dramatize what's\ngoing on with you. We passed some people\nwho had had a minor crash and a woman\nblew out her rear wheel. The spoke\npulled through the carbon and she\nactually cracked her frame. So, she had\na legit reason to quit. She couldn't\nphysically pedal her bike anymore. I had\nback pain. Like, what am I going to do?\nCall up the sag wagon and be like, \"Oh,\nmy back hurts. Can you give me a ride\nback to the start line?\" Like, come on.\nOther people had it way worse.\nThat brings me to the next point number\nfour. Imagine what you would feel if you\ndid\nquit. This is a really\ngood decision makingaking tool in the\nmoment. Because if you can\nimagine everything is done, you've quit,\nall your friends have finished, how are\nyou going to feel? Now, this is good in\na couple ways. because it can either be\nthe reason you quit or the reason you\nfinish. And what I mean by that is if\nyou've got a serious\nproblem, like you know, if you push\nthrough this\npain, it's going to be devastating and\nsomething's going to be wrong. Maybe\nyou'll have hospital visit, something\nterrible is going to happen. Or if it if\nit's the case of that other person whose\nbike had\nbroken, obviously there's something else\ngoing on there.\nSo you\ncan be done. You quit, but you know that\nyou gave everything you could and that\nwas it. That was it for the day and you\nfeel good about it. Or you quit because\nit was too hard or you didn't feel like\nit. How are you going to feel at the end\nof then? You're not going to have this.\nYeah. You know what? I gave it my all. I\ndid my best. I needed to quit today. I\nwas done. You're gonna have the feeling\nof I could have done more. I could have\ndone more. I wasn't hurting that bad. I\ncould have\nfinished. Now, wherever you fall on that\nspectrum doesn't really matter. It\ndoesn't matter what anybody else thinks\nabout your quitting. It only matters\nwhat you think. But if you quit and you\nknow you didn't have to, it's going to\neat you alive. I know it. I've done it\nonce or twice where I just quit because\nI felt like quitting and it sucked cuz\nwhen I was sitting watching my friends\nwho had finished it was awful because I\nknew that I could have done\nit. And that brings me to number five in\nmy mental strategies to endure\nsuffering. Don't stop.\nJust keep going forward. Just keep\nswimming. Just keep\npedaling. Just keep\nsuffering. Just keep doing it. Because\nas someone famous once said, I don't\nknow who said it. We always see these\nquotes. The only way is through. It's\nthe only way to the other side. We just\nhave to go through. You have to\npersevere. So if you want to finish\nsomething\nsounds stupid.\nYou just got to finish it. You got to\npush through and just do\nit. Not always\neasy, but it's pretty\nsimple. So yeah, that is my synopsis of\nthis race in five mental strategies to\nhelp finish an endurance\nevent of any kind. Can apply to a lot of\nthings.\nAvoid the metrics in the\nmoment. Break down the distance into\nsmall, manageable\nchunks. Remember what Remember that\nyou're not\nalone. Imagine the\nfeeling after if you\nquit and don't stop.\nThanks so much for watching today as I\ndid finish this\nrace. I pushed through even though I did\nnot want to. And eventually, as you can\nsee now, I got to enjoy the sunlight\ninstead of the cold, rainy nonsense of\nthe morning. It was cold. God, it was so\nfreaking cold when we started.\nBut the sun came out, dried up a little\nbit of the rain. Not very much. It was\nstill really wet. The whole day was wet.\nBut yeah, I\nfinished. I don't really know how. And\nit kind of sucked, but I'm really glad\nthat I stuck it through cuz I would have\nfelt like crap if I was done and I\ndidn't give it all that I had. So yeah.\nUh if this was of any value today,\nplease like, subscribe if you want to\nsee more content like this, and shoot me\na comment below.\nIf you've had an event that you wanted\nto quit, whether you quit or didn't, you\ncan tell me about that. Whatever it is,\nI' I'd like to hear your story on how\nyou got through or how you didn't get\nthrough and how you felt about it\nafterwards. So, yeah. Thanks for tuning\nin to Adam's Adventure today and go\ncrush it."
