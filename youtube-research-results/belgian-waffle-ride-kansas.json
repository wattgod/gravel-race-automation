      "description": "#biggravelmiles #gravelrace\nThis was my first time racing this event and man, I have been missing out.  Everything about the event was top notch.  Great communication leading up to the race and very well run on race day.  There was a give away after the race with a ton of prizes AND they podium the top three riders in each each age group.  AND the champ in each age group gets a national championship jersey.  Hats off to Roger and crew for putting together such an incredible event.  I will be back!\n\nStrava link to my race: https://www.strava.com/activities/6088838839",

      "description": "#biggravelmiles #gravelrace #belgianwaffleride\nThe first ever Belgian Waffle Ride Kansas was crazy.  111 miles with over 7,000 ft. of elevation.  The course had everything.  Road, gravel, single track, cyclocross.  Elijah's chain basically exploded around mile 30 and somehow we were able to get it fixed, kinda, and roll to the finish.  This course itself was extremely difficult.  Throw in the wind and it made it extremely BRUTAL.  All in all though, it turned out to be a great day on the bike.\n\nStrava link to race: https://www.strava.com/activities/6194458274",

      "description": "The final stop of the Quadruple Crown of the BWR series headed to Lawrence, Ks. I was hoping to salvage some semblance of an overall and also end my 2022 gravel season on a high note. Trying to figure out the long distance learning curve this year has been tough. The transition from pinner xc and CX events to long 6-7hr slogs has been a challenge. But my hopes were high and at the very least I'd get to hang out with Wally and Beck together for the first time all year. \n\nWally and I finished 6/7th on the day and Becca won! It was both of their first BWR's and they walked away saying they would \"for sure\" look to do more of these next year. \n\nThese videos take a lot of  time to make and sometimes the adventures are expensive. If you feel like donating to encourage/help me offset costs, THANKYOU!

      "transcript": "hey there my name is Taylor this is a\nrecap of the 2023 Belgian waffle ride in\nLawrence Kansas my brother Rusty and I\nsigned up for the full 123 M waffle\nroute as our big end of season ride we\nrode 63 miles at gravel Locos in May and\nin the 5 months since then we have been\ntraining about 10 hours per week good Lu\nbeing at the start line with more than\n400 other Riders was exciting even\nthough some of them were doing the\nshorter routes I was eager to get\nrolling partly because it was cold and\nwindy passing us on the left in the\nyellow and red jersey is Drew dilman who\nended up finishing third you can see how\nquickly he moves through the crowd to\nget up with the front\nrout unfortunately there was a little\nbit of a bottleneck right here at the\nstart I think everyone made it through\nall right but it's just a bit weird to\nbe dodging Porta potis and trucks at the\nbeginning of an organized\nride my brother and I had been training\nAll Summer in Texas so it was usually\nsunny and the heat index was often above\n100\u00b0 that made the cool weather in\nKansas feel even colder to us uh it was\nabout 55\u00b0 with up to like a 20 mph wind\nout of the northwest so he and I both\nbought a bunch of new cold weather gear\njust for this\nride most of our training was on the\nroad we did do a few gravel rides but we\nweren't as confident on the gravel as we\nwould have liked to\nbe this route had over 7,000 ft of\nclimbing with grades up to\n18% during training we were lucky to do\nhalf of that uh much climbing over an\nentire week the steepest hill near us is\nlike in an 8% grade for maybe a tenth of\na mile our plan for this ride was to\nhold 300 watts during the climbs so as\nto avoid burning out way too early how\nyou doing today good the promotional\nmaterial for this event said it's as\nmuch an eating competition as it is a\nbike race and that's definitely true we\nfound it challenging to eat while riding\ndue to both the gravel and the hills the\nfood we brought was Cliff shop blocks\nwhich are normally fine in the heat but\nin the cold they became very difficult\nto chew quickly so if I was going to do\nthis again I would bring something that\ndidn't require chewing just like\nsyrup this Rider on my left really\npushed hard on the climbs they kept\npassing us on the uphills and then we\nwould pass them on the downhills\neventually they turned off for one of\nthe shorter routes so I think we made\nthe right call holding our 300 watts and\nnot trying to keep up with\nthem the aid stations were well stocked\nwith plenty of water and mix and food\nthe people manning them were friendly\nand helpful too that being said I did\nhave two minor complaints the first is\nthat the drink mix while it did have\ncarbohydrates it was potato and rice\nbased rather than sugar based that\nseemed like an unusual choice to me it's\nnot a drink mix that I'm used to and my\nsecond complaint is that a lot of the\nfood had caffeine in it which made it\nhard to balance getting enough to eat\nwith consuming too much\ncaffeine oh come on shift I sometimes\nhad a little bit of trouble shifting in\nthis instance I wasn't able to shift\ninto the smaller ring up front even\nthough I tried to that forced me to put\na foot down which made this climb much\nharder and although I used every gear in\nmy drivetrain I can see why people run\none by setups having one less derailer\nto worry about would really be\nnice some of the downhills turned into\nwashboards about halfway down that made\nit hard to maintain control while\nkeeping a reasonable speed and as you\ncan see with this guy sometimes your\nbottles wanted to pop off the bike\nfortunately for Rusty and me we never\nlost any\nbottles\nI think we were both underprepared for\nthe more technical parts of this ride\nwe're both basically Ries and the double\ntrack section wasn't too bad but I\nreally struggled on the single track\nportion the trail is actually meant for\nhiking instead of mountain biking so I\ntook it really slow through there to\nmake sure that I didn't crash also I\nwalked through the really tricky Parts\nuh I had not practiced getting on and\noff the bike quickly so that was\nespecially slow for me I'm sure cycl CLA\nRiders did a lot better through this\nsection there he is after the single\ntrack we had these nice connector paths\nthrough some Fields it may look smooth\non video but the ground was surprisingly\nbumpy still it was nice for things to\nopen up and not worry about running into\ntrees for a little while my brother was\nwaiting for me there because he heard my\ndisc brakes squealing in the distance\nand knew I'd be\ncoming I should take a minute to\ndescribe our goals so we had finished\ngravel Locos in about 4 hours and that\nwas a 63m ride we also finished a 101\nMile Road ride in just under 5 hours so\nwe thought 8 hours was a reasonable goal\nfor this 123 M gravel ride Honestly\nthough for me I just wanted to finish\nand thought maybe we'd take around 9\nhours at this point we're about 4 and 1\nhalf hours in we've done a little less\nthan half of the course so it might seem\nlike we're behind our 8 Hour goal but we\nhad been fighting a headwind basically\nthe whole time we figured that we could\nmake up some time once we turned around\nand had that wind behind\nus but before we could enjoy that\nTailwind we had to cross over this\nSpillway the crosswind was strong here\nsince we're at the crest of a hill and\nthere's nothing to break the wind uh the\nwind was so strong that it nearly blew\nus over and I feel bad for that\nphotographer that just had to sit there\nin the wind all\nday most of the cars we encountered were\ncourteous and gave us plenty of room as\nthey passed but this truck towing farm\nequipment passed close to us for\nseemingly no\nreason have on by the time we got got to\nthis intersection it wasn't still closed\ntwo cars but there was someone in that\nLantern Rouge truck keeping an eye out\nand talking to us through a PA they told\nus to enjoy the hill which you know we\ntried but then that dang truck with his\nfarm equipment somehow passes us again\nexcept this time it was on a gravel road\nand they passed us even closer than last\ntime I have no idea how they managed to\npass us twice especially since we were\ngoing so much slower than them but the\nMind aside from Cars the other\nexcitement we encountered on the road\nwas dogs one of them charged right up to\nus but then kept its distance um we were\nworried about running into them or being\nbit but fortunately neither of those\nthings happened and we were able to keep\nriding in peace still it's not great to\ncome across loose dogs on a\nride between the two of us we only had\none crash all all day and it was very\nlowkey the route had a lot of these\ndownhills that ended with a sharp turn\nat the bottom of this one Rusty had a\nbit of a problem and just kind of tipped\nover fortunately both he and his bike\nwere fine we were able to get back up\nand keep riding that was the only\nunplanned stop all day no other crashes\nor mechanical issues or flats or\nanything like\nthat our plan was to roll past\nthis aid station because there was\nanother one in just 10 more miles uh it\ndidn't make sense to stop twice in such\nquick succession so we went for the\nlater\none unfortunately for me around this\npart of the race I started feeling not\nvery good maybe I hadn't eaten enough or\nthe unusual drink mix from the aid\nstations wasn't sitting well with me\neither way I was fading fast I li lied\nmy way to the aid station and gave up I\nsat around eating there for like half an\nhour and then one of the volunteers gave\nme a ride back to the start line\nalthough I was disappointed by not\nfinishing I'm still proud of what I did\nuh it was perhaps the hardest bike ride\nI have ever\ndone although that was the end of the\nrace for me Rusty kept riding for\nanother 2 and 1/2 hours to finish the\nentire course I'm proud of him for\nsoldiering on through another 36 miles\nincluding the final single track\nsection we both had a great time at this\nyear's Belgian waffle ride in Kansas it\nwas challenging but rewarding and maybe\nnext time I'll be able to complete\nit thanks for watching please like And\nsubscribe for more cycling content I'll\nsee you in the next\none"
