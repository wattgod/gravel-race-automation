      "transcript": "[Music]\nHey everyone, this is Trevor with\nRecreation Leader. I just want to tell\nyou about this awesome event coming up\non July 12th. It is Dirtfest and we\nwould love to see you out there because\nthis is what makes Bend Ben.\nMy name is Mike Ripley, owner of\nMudslinger Events, and uh this is Ben\nDirtfest, our first year operating this\nmulti-port festival. uh in Bend, Oregon.\nSecond weekend of July on a Saturday.\nWe've always wanted to have an event\nthat incorporates trail running and\ngravel cycling and mountain biking.\nSomething that builds on the community's\nadventure and the fact that people in\nBen, they do everything. Somebody always\nhas a jam. And we want to be that\nlowhanging fruit for a really good day\noutdoors. At the Ben Dirtfest, we have a\nhalf marathon trail run. Uh it's about\n60/40 trail to road. the cycling events,\nthe gravel 55 miles, uh, and the\nmountain bike 39 filled with single\ntrack gravel, hard climbs, all the\ncycling events will take off at 8:15,\nuh, after the trail run takes off from\nthe athletic club at 8:00. We'll ride\nout Century and get over to Road 41\nwhere there'll be a course split, but\nthe running is going to be active all\nday, running by Rimrock for an aid\nstation uh, out and back and hit some\nreally good Ben single track uh, to come\nback for your friends. The key thing on\nthis event though is you can do it solo,\nbut if you find another person that is\none of those other disciplines, you\ncould do a twoerson or a threeperson to\ncollaborate and have your times all sync\nup for overall awards. We're just really\nreally excited about bringing a new\nevent to Ben that can involve anybody of\nany level. It's going to be just a\nwonderful time with a band, a DJ, food\ntrucks. If anybody wants more\ninformation, check out\nmudslingervents.com in our events tab or\nbenthurtfest.com and you get all the\ninformation including the tech guide and\nwhat to know for a great day on the\nsecond Saturday in July."

my race start which is\nat 5 00 pm there's a little time trial\na little time trial because it's only 5\nmiles\nto start the cascade gravel grinder\nit's gonna be a lovely sunny beautiful\nday but i spent the last two days\ngetting\nthis thing built\ni'm really excited i'm really excited i\nyou know i've been riding my own brand\nof bikes for a while\nand\ni'm pretty hyped about the niner\nthe cat's gonna miss me\ngets a little fussy whenever i take off\ni may have made a great mistake hopping\non i-5 south at 3 p.m on a friday in\nportland oregon because we now have la\ntraffic\ni don't really get stressed out about\ntraffic i don't do road rage because\nwhen i'm in the van you're just driving\nand if everything sucks i'll just stop\nand take a nap\namazing well here we go\ncascade gravel grinder stage race let's\ndo it\nokay\noh sweet all three bikes are still\non the van\nyou notice it's\nraining and we're at altitude so this\nrain is basically going to be it's\nbasically hail it's cold as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] i have\na skin suit on\nanyways um\ni remember my 40 mil\nchallenge getaways on nvg23\ngravel wheels\nthis is new for me normally i run the 46\n30 and i'm running\nthe 4831\ngrx 2 buy\nsetup i got a stages\npower meter\none bottle of water and this is my new\nniner rlt9 so this is literally my first\nbike ride on it i mean i rode it down my\ndriveway and made sure the brakes were\nsquealing as this breaks or want to do\noh\n[Music]\n[Applause]\nso\nah riding the snow is actually really\nhard that's really fun that's hard as\nhell\ndo you want to talk about everything\nthat went into making this event happen\noh wow you know some events go pretty\nsmoothly others just go kicking and\nscreaming this was absolutely pummeling\nus for these last two weeks in march\nwe're thinking we're going to get up\nthere so early we're going to have\nleisure amounts of time to clear all the\ntrees and there's not going to be any\nsnow this year no problem and then april\nhit and it just kept coming and then may\nthe weekend before\nour event here mal batcher received\nalmost two feet over the weekend of new\nsnow so it made it just an undaunting\ntask i mean we like to to to walk that\nfine line between the suffer factor but\nthen also add in the aesthetics and the\nbeauty and the challenge so that people\ndon't get done just say well that just\nsucked well yeah it sucked but man there\nwas also spectacular this is my first\nbig training block actually three days\nof uh racing that'll get you started\nyeah thanks chad thank you yeah i'll see\nyou man i feel like time trials are that\nthing where like you always went as hard\nas you could and you think you did\nreally good and then like no you get\nlike 28th place you're like oh i thought\ni thought i got all the podiums\npre-erased pasta free rice coffee\nnutrition for the ride\nhere we are at stage two of the\ncascade gravel grinder it was windy af\nall night long\nmy bikes are still racked up my q at\nit's\nit's cool\nit's day three at the cascade gravel\ngrinder we're in sisters lovely\nbeautiful sisters oregon and we're gonna\nget to\nride some roads\nthat folks don't really ever get to ride\nmainly because\nchad sperry of breakaway promotions and\nhis crew my buddy tony kick a bunch of\nother dudes and ladies they went snow\nblowed and plowed all these roads so\ntypically these roads are just covered\nin snow and you can't access them so\nthese aren't roads that like you can\nnever really ride around beds and\nsisters except for in the summer but in\nthe summer they're all dusty and hot as\n[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and blown out so this is actually\npretty special\nthat was some epic weather i appreciate\neverybody who suffered through friday\nand saturday to get to here you guys are\nheroes in my book big hand to you folks\nphase three big grinder\ni've never owned an actual gravel bike\num\nwith a lower bottom bracket it's it's\nlonger you know the front end is a\nlittle slacker than most so the bikes\nthat i've been racing for the last\n20 years have been cycle cross bikes\nwith a cyclocross bike i shift my weight\nforwards and back a lot more the bike's\na little more compact it's higher off\nthe ground and i was really noticing\nthat like i can't put my weight too much\nover the front wheel with the way the\nbike's designed it's really really\nreally stable and\nwith the front end being a little more\nout front it's super stable in turns and\nin a straight line and i mean it was\nperfect for what we're doing i mean it's\nperfect for gravel whereas i've\nbasically been riding cross spikes which\nare a hell of a lot twitchier and kind\nof quicker to respond and so i have to\nput my weight over the front wheel just\nto keep that wheel like planted on the\nground when i'm making these kind of\nlike you know\ntwitchier turns and this thing i kind of\ngot to a point yesterday was like oh i\njust kind of need to like\nback off and let the bike do its job"
