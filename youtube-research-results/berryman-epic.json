      "transcript": "foreign\ndo like a little bit of a channel update\nhere\nI know most of my videos are all about\nlike camping which I would keep that\ngoing here throughout the year I'm gonna\nbe doing a lot more camping just\nI thought I'm not much of a cold person\nso\nwith these colder days come\nI really just don't feel like getting\nout there and camping I'd rather do the\nwarmer days maybe probably in the mostly\nthose rainy days too but\nwhat I want to add now\nI want to do more running content\nlike right now I'm doing a big training\nthing for a 50 miler race down\nthe Berryman in Missouri\nso I'm gonna do like a little training\num video update thing just kind of going\nthrough that I got this new camera here\nthat can\nI don't know I think I can\nprobably hold up for some good running\nvideos we'll see that's just something\nto mess around with hope you all enjoy\nit\nall right\nkind of a bigger Life Update with it too\nbecause\num\nback in November\nI was talking to my brother\nabout running the Berryman we even uh\nwent out there and hiked it a little bit\njust to kind of scope it out and I was\ntalking about a big camping trip I was\ngoing to do out there while also doing\nthe 50 miler\nso kept on talking about that Christmas\nI was talking about that\nso that's like the big Life Update there\nis a\nhe's no longer with us\nit's been about a month now actually\nit's actually exactly a month uh\nFebruary 4th\nI guess uh everything happened on\nJanuary 4th but\nthat is no longer here\nbut after all that talking with him\nabout the race\nI'm gonna do all I can to\nmake sure I do that race\nall signed up for it\nwould be a good one we're gonna we're\ngonna run far\ncrank we're gonna run far\n15 minute warm-up done\nmuscles are feeling great body's feeling\ngood\njust gonna give a the calves a little\nbit of a stretch\nand then I'll get going\nI should have looked at it I think the\ntraining was\nfive\nno it was four\nfour intervals three minutes long per\ninterval three minute cooldown per\ninterval so\nit could take a little bit of time\nactually\nthree three three three three three\nthree three three three\nI'll be recording as I get all right\nthree minute interval you know that\nseems like a long time but\nit says ease into the interval\nget to your speed hold it and then ease\nback so I think 30 seconds to get up to\nspeed 30 seconds to pull back\nwe'll see how it goes but let's do this\nall right one two three go\nI don't know\nvery much very long time\nyeah my goodness\nthree minutes\nit wasn't too bad\na three minute break is going to be\nhandy\nif you can tell\nI'm breathing but I mean I I can still\ntalk so that's always a good news\nround one down\nyeah just kind of wanted to put that\nlife update out there there's\njust gonna be a lot more content maybe\njust about running in general\nit's my one of my favorite path actually\nit's my favorite past I'm happy to do\nthat besides camping and yoga I got a\nlot of a lot of things but running yoga\ncamping\nand then another thing I want to kind of\nlook into\nFrank was always a big uh astronomy guy\ngetting something to do at night be able\nto look at the stars and then while I'm\ncamping might as well know what the\nstars are all about so hopefully I'm\ncamping in a really nice clear days\nbeautiful stars up there\nthis guy\nso yeah\njust keep an update and keep a watch on\nthe channel\noh\njust be posting here and there if I know\nI'm still gonna do the camping videos\nbut you'll just see some running videos\non there so\nwe'll get this Berryman done\nthat's for sure\ngood morning hi\n[Music]\nthank you\nI screwed up there\nwell that way\nI feel like I really need a stick right\nnow\nhey\nlook at that\nlet's follow him\nback at it again\ntoday is Sunday\nAugust wait August\nit's February I think this is a long\nways away all right so it's\nFebruary\n5th\nSunday\nthis is the\nlast week of the first month for my\ntraining\nit's uh my update on how the progress is\ngoing is going on right now\nI'll say\nit's 50 mile training it is\ntough\nreally really tough\nI started off with the intervals\nmoving on to template runs doing the\nEnduro runs\nit only gets more difficult they're out\nof the program but I'm still feeling\npretty strong\nuh\nwell\nI guess on a Wednesday last week I was\non a recovery run I thought something\nreally weird\nin my\nmy calves Cali shut up towards the hip\ntoo which kind of made me scratch my\nhead\nso I did the next best thing that you\ncould possibly do is instead of\ncontinuing on\nstopped\nwent back home\nassess the situation\nThursday came around\nmy plan was to do a temper run that day\nI went to work\nlooked at my leg\nworked on it stretched it everything\nand from there\nI just decided\nthey don't listen to your body Wayne\nthere's no need\nto push yourself every single day\nbecause you're just gonna get yourself\nhurt\nthe training plan is here to guide you\nnow it's my goal to make sure I don't\nget hurt\nso Thursday\nrest day no Temple Run Friday it's\nalready a rough day so I gave you two\ngood days of resting\nand then Saturday came around\nwoke up\nfeeling great my leg is kind of back up\nto where it needs to be again\nwent out for\nI guess there was an hour run in the\nmorning\ngot back to Des Moines\nat the\nFleet Feet shoe store where I'm a mentor\nfor the half marathon training program\nyeah\nall right continued on my hour 30 run\nwith them\ndoing the remainder 30 minutes grinding\nwith them so I got the hour and a half\ndone there heading out today\nhis that last day\nfor the monthly\nnext month gets a little more difficult\nbut\ngive it a two hour endurance run today\nbefore this film\nI'm really really still cautious so\nI went over to\nmy yoga studio I got my the Des Moines\nwhat am I saying here\nI went over to the yoga studio where I\ngo where I attend and\nI did a restore class so some Yin Yoga\nand just kind of really worked into the\nfascia into those really deep\ntissue fibers or whatever they wanted to\ncall them\nI did that for about an hour felt good\ndon't don't\nreally good\nthen from there\nI asked people it's like mind if I just\nleave my car here yeah\njust take off from the yoga studio you\ngo for my run\nthat's what I did\nand on the Run\nI am so far an hour into it\nand I am feeling great I'm gonna\ncontinue on path here\nI just counted this straight out and\nback thing\nyeah I'm actually out here in Waukee\nIowa\nI've never really done much running out\nhere so\nwhen you got all these long endurance\nruns might as well\nmake fun of it\nand just explore the area in which you\nlive\nand why not you're you're here\nyou got the time\njust do it\nnext things more interesting next\nthing's more fun just being in different\nplaces seeing new things\nyeah yeah\nso the plan's going good I am\nI guess there's four months to go and\nlike I said they get more and more\ndifficult\nI can't tell but it actually looks like\nMarch\nin early April is really\nwhere it's gonna be tested in my limits\nI'm excited\nI really really want to know what my\nlimits are\nreally want to push those boundaries\nand just\njust continue on\nwe're out here running now\nI hope you're enjoying this\nbecause the weather right now\nis just absolutely superb I think we got\nlike\nI think they're saying it's like 30\ndegrees outside but I mean with my\nsweatshirt on I'm even kind of wearing\nlike some short style things\nlaughs\nand\nit feels so good\nthere's a loop here\nlet's just get lost I really have no\nplan just hopefully there's not a\nmountain lion like a cougar whatever you\nwant to call them\nfollowing me\ncould be\nor it's all just my imagination\nwhich that's more likely all right here\nwe go\nthere were a few days in the program\nwhere I started I mean the training\nprogram started\nJanuary 2nd\neverything fell apart\nFebruary 4th so I missed two days of the\ntraining because\nhonestly I just didn't want to do it I\nwasn't up to it I couldn't even think\nabout running I really just had to get\nhome get to get to my parents and just\ngo Mom Dad I'm here\nso I did that\nand then\nwhat I figured everything was all\nsituated\nI was able to kick back into action\nit still sucks\nI don't like saying that word\nbut it really\nnothing nothing's fun about this I'm not\ntired of the training program it's just\ntalking about grieving\nit's a process\njust like any other thing\nwe get through it\nstill just makes you wonder every single\ntime now\nwhy was\nsomebody brought into your life\nfor so long\nfrom birth actually I mean he was around\nme 32 years\nand I'm just\nups and goes\nmakes you wonder\nwhat\nI can't\ncan't dwell\nI can't just sink\nthe boat keeps moving it keeps sailing\nforward\nalways\nyou give that a stick but why why let\nyourself sink\nFrank wouldn't want that\nand I don't want that\nI am progressing\nat least I hope so I really know I think\nit's Progressive so\nkeep with me\nif you want to see this progress\nlike And subscribe if you want\nit really doesn't matter to me\nI'm gonna have some fun here so get\nready\nfor some fun\nI'm gonna get again continue on with the\nrun here so I'll catch back up with you\nin just a bit but time to get back to\nfocus here and let my mind sink back\ninto that right mindful spot here\ncatch back into you later"
