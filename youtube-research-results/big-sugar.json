      "transcript": "[Music]\nWelcome to Northwest Arkansas. We are\nhere live at the 2025 Lifetime Grand\nPrix. Stop number six, the Big Sugar\nGravel. And uh well, the story of the\nweekend so far has been weather. We've\nbeen keeping our eye on the weather\nsince probably about Wednesday or\nThursday with some impending storms. You\ncan see outside it's a little bit damp\nout there. The weather gods not going to\nsmile on uh on our area out here today.\nSo, it's going to be an interesting\nrace. So, if you've been following\nalong, we are going to do the 50mile\nversion today. It's a lot of debate back\nand forth. the final decision coming a\nlittle bit earlier this morning, but\nthat decision didn't come lightly and\ntrying to take into account all the\nfactors, trying to have an exciting\nfinale to the race and uh also trying to\nkeep the athletes as safe as they can.\nSo 50 mi is what it's going to be. It's\ngoing to be a great race. I'm Bill\nEllison. I'm joined here in the studio\nMeredith Miller and we are excited to\nbring you what is going to be maybe a\nlittle bit more of an exciting race than\nuh than what we anticipated. We haven't\nseen a race like this on gravel with\nthese guys and and women today. So, how\nthey're going to race is going to be\nreally interesting. I'm I'm really\nexcited to see what the tactics are for\nthe day and who goes to the front. We've\nseen there's Cameron Jones who the\nwinner of Unbound and the Leadville H\nsorry um Little Sugar last weekend just\ntaking the reigns and going from the\nfront of the race, you know, for so\nlong. I don't know that he'll be able to\ndo that today with how fast it is, but I\ndon't doubt that he'll try.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think he doesn't know any other\nway to race than just, you know, kind of\ncrack that throttle and go. And, uh,\nhe's such a happy go-lucky guy. It's fun\nto talk to him after the race about some\nof those tactics. And he just wants to\nrace his bike. And, you know, if he sees\nthat that guys are easing up and and\ntrying to think about a move, he just\nstands on it, goes to the front, and I\nmean, he's strong enough that it works.\nI think I remember at Unbound. He was\nfor that race at least in particular, he\nwas saying telling me he was taking in\nlike 150 g of carbs an hour to to just\nstay on top of the fueling out there.\nSo, he's got this endless supply of\nenergy as we're now getting our\ncountdown on the line. So, we are just\nabout to get underway. Hard to believe\nthat uh it seems like just yesterday we\nwere at Sea Otter doing this and now\nwe're at the end of the season, the\nfinal stop of 2025. And just like that,\nour men are now\ngetting themselves underway here.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, Bill, I I I just I can't stop saying\nI'm so excited because it's just a it's\ngoing to be such a different race than\nwe're used to seeing today. Yeah, the\nthese races these pro racers always go\nout fast. I I mean, when I have started\nsome of these racer races before myself,\nI am incredibly impressed with how fast\nthey go out of the gate. even when it's\n100 miles or 150 or 200 or whatever it\nis. And today I I think as soon as the\nlead vehicles pull out of the way and\nand the race is truly underway, we are\ngoing to see someone going to this to\nthe front of this race and they're going\nto lay down the gas right away. I don't\nknow if ever in the history of the\nLifetime Grand Prix, which we're in year\nfour, but as we mentioned, Keegan\nSwinson has already, you know, has\nalways had this locked up in the past.\nAnd this is just such a such a different\nway to begin the race today because\nnormally he's just been able to sit back\nand kind of, oh boy, coming around the\ncars there at the start of this race.\nBut, you know, normally he's been able\nto come in super relaxed and just be\nlike, okay, I I mean, he's a competitor,\nright? he's always going to want to win\na race no matter what, even though he\ndidn't have to for the overall series.\nBut today, he definitely has his work\ncut out for him as he's got, you know,\nseveral guys just chomping at, you know,\nright on his heels uh to take the\noverall today. And and like I said\nbefore, you know, we'll see who has some\nalliances out there. You know, Keegan\nhas always raced with his teammate Tobin\nOrton Blad.\nNow, some other guys who are right\nbehind him. We'll see if they've been\nable to, you know, talk to other guys in\nthe Pelaton and say, \"Hey, you know,\nyou're lower down in the standings or\nmaybe even some people who are in the\nrace today that aren't in the Lifetime\nGrand Prix and try to say, hey, let's\nwork together. Um, if you help me, I'll\nhelp you.\" And, you know, either get you\nin the prize money or help me get up\nhigher in the overall standings. So,\nit's uh I'm curious to see who is going\nto be doing working for who out there\ntoday. And now back to the line here\nwith our women. They're getting their\nfinal instructions here. Making sure our\nBronco pace vehicle is ready to go.\nEscort them out of town here and\nwe'll be down to business relatively\nquickly.\n&gt;&gt; Cesley Decker on the front row there\nriding for Pod Normile Studios. And\nCesley, she's had a great series uh so\nfar this year. She's really had some\nsome phenomenal results. A former skier\nthat came over to bike racing uh to to\ndeal with a bit of an career ending knee\ninjury on the ski side, but she was your\nwinner at Unbound and second place at\nSea Otter. Also had second at Leadville.\nSo, non-starter though last week at uh\nat Little Sugar. We know she had a\nlittle bit of a back issue, right?\n&gt;&gt; Uh so was trying to let that rehab\nitself, mend itself a little bit. So,\nuh, we'll see if that tactic worked out\nfor her. Obviously, not starting last\nweek kind of plays a significant role in\nin her not contending for the overall\nlead at this point going into the final\nrace. So,\n&gt;&gt; sure. But also, let's, you know, let's\ncall it what it is. I think Sophia has\ndominated Little Sugar for the last few\nyears. Fair enough. So, and and Cesley\ndoes not come from a mountain bike\nbackground. As you mentioned, she was a\ndownhill skier, a mount an alpine skier.\nSo, let me tell you her skills. From my\nexperience, any skiers who've come over\nto to cycling, their skills are\nphenomenal. They just know how to move\nwith, you know, the terrain under them,\nwhether it's two wheels or pair of skis.\nAnd so, she's an excellent bike handler.\nBut Sophia has dominated Little Sugar.\nAnd I think the chances of Cesaly\nbeating Sophia at Little Sugar would\nhave been pretty slim. So Cesley made\nthat calculated decision to not start\nknowing that today was going to be\nreally important to still maintain that\nsecond place overall and uh and I think\nit could pay off today. I know she wants\nto win the race today and to help her\nmaintain that overall second place.\n&gt;&gt; Well, we're watching our women roll out\nand today's lead out is brought to you\nby the Bronco Wild Fund. Driving a\npassion for the outdoors and helping\npreserve the places we ride. Also\na reminder, today's live coverage is\npresented by Orange Seal, the seal\nentrusted by pros to keep them rolling\nthrough the toughest terrain. And well,\nno better place here than Northwest\nArkansas to bring our friends at Orange\nSeal into the mix.\nSo, our women are officially off and\nrolling. They've got their neutral start\non the way out of town here as well. And\njust like the men, I suspect as soon as\nthe flag drops and we're officially\nracing, this one's going to go full gas.\nThe question now and we we kind of asked\nSophia yesterday on the athlete panel\nlike look, you know, you've got this\nlocked up. We know we've got some\npotential weather coming. Is that going\nto maybe affect your tactic in this\nrace? Do you really need to go to the\nwell here today just to to prove a point\nreally at the end of the day? And and\nshe was kind of honest about it. She\nknew that, you know, a couple years ago\nshe had been in that situation and,\n&gt;&gt; you know, went pretty hard for the first\nhalf of the race, then kind of eased up\na little bit and tried to soak in the uh\nthe experience here at Big at Big Sugar.\nAnd while she enjoyed that, she's a\ncompetitor through and through. So, I\nthink\n&gt;&gt; uh you know, you pin a number on, you're\ngoing to race your bike, right? That's\njust kind of how it goes at certainly at\nthe elite level like that. So, I think\nSophia, as much as as much as some\nriders want to think, she might uh she\nmight pull back a little bit and maybe\nuh maybe not put herself in the mix, I\nthink she's I think she's going to be\nvery much in the mix there today. And,\nyou know, maybe some of the other riders\ncan kind of play off of that, you know,\nwith the with the tactical game out\nthere with Cesily, with the Misa, with\nAlexis, all vying to uh get them keep\nthemselves on the podium or in Alexis's\ncase, get on that final podium. Here\nwe're back to the men and man are they\ngoing for it. You can see when they're\nlike their chest is down towards the\nstem. We see I think this looks like a\nlittle bit of riders. Yeah. Yeah. Matt\nBeer's obviously in there. Uh the big\nman out of South Africa. And we we\nwondered how he recovered from his crash\nand some stitches last week. Uh I\nbelieve on his knee at Lil Sugar. Uh he\nbarely made our podium appearance last\nweek cuz he was trying to get some\nstitches at the ready care and obviously\nkind of answers our question. He's\nfeeling pretty good right now as he\nquickly dispatching. There was a\nslightly bigger group there but looks\nlike one or two riders falling off the\npace as he gave a dig over that climb.\nSo we'll try and identify the rest of\nthese riders but we don't see the field\nbehind. So we know that that's uh at\nleast a 15 maybe 20 second gap right now\nby what looks to be about three riders.\nBut I don't expect the Pelaton to give\nthem much of a leash today. You just you\ncan't in a 50 mile race. You don't you\njust you obviously have less time to\nbring back any any brakes that go up the\nroad. So I think the Pelaton is going to\nkeep a tighter leash on anything that\ndoes go up the road or at least they're\ngoing to try to keep a tighter leash. So\nlooks like the the chase right now is\nkind of uh is not really\non just yet. But we're seeing the guys\nspread out side to side across the road.\nThat tells me that the the pace of the\nchase group. Yeah, we're we're still not\nseeing them come around that last corner\nthere. So, they're not too worried, but\nwhich surprises me because\n&gt;&gt; this is uh this with Matt Beer is here\nin the front right now driving this\npace. And you know, I'm curious. There\nwere four guys in this in this group and\none dropped off. And I'm curious if that\nwas because he was he got dropped or if\nhe was dropping back to maybe help a I\ndon't know a teammate or a friend or\nwhatever close that gap because he saw\nhow fast these guys were going and how\ndetermined he they are to get that gap.\nSo he's like, \"All right, I've got to go\nback and help somebody get back up to\nthe front of this race.\"\n&gt;&gt; Today's race update brought to you by\nRoad ID.\n&gt;&gt; So I think that other rider up there,\nMatt Wilson. Yeah. So, Matt Wilson uh\ngetting himself in the mix out of New\nZealand. And Matt was one of the wild\ncards, right, that made his way into the\nGrand Prix and uh showcasing himself as\nas having been a a worthy addition. So,\ngood to see Matt up there.\n&gt;&gt; Another Kiwi,\n&gt;&gt; right,\n&gt;&gt; Cam Jones.\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n&gt;&gt; Caleb Botchers, another Kiwi athlete in\nthe men's field. All three of those guys\njust uh really performing at the top of\ntheir level this year. There's something\nin the water down in New Zealand. I\n&gt;&gt; I'm telling you, you've you've raced\ndown in the you know, you live down\nthere and so, you know, I've raced down\nthere a little bit back in back in the\nday and it's I think it's fair to say\nit. They they grow a different breed of\nbike racer down in New Zealand and they\nare they are hard hard riders that can\nhandle an amazing amount of uh different\nthings thrown at them.\nSo, here in the women's race, we're\nwe're still seeing a few women kind of\ntailed off the back of this group.\nDoesn't look like it's uh too high speed\njust yet. You know, go around this\ncorner, we'll see it stretch out a\nlittle bit more, but anytime you see\nriders kind of side to side of on the\nroad, that tells you that the speed\nisn't isn't super high pace. But looking\nnow, I believe this is Ma Ferrell um\ntaking charge at the front of the RA\nfront front of this race. And again,\nwhen when you see somebody who's like\ndown in the drops, elbows bent, chest\ncloser to the stem, that's an indication\nthat they're going really hard. They're\nputting a lot of power into the pedals\nand making a big effort to really ramp\nup the speed.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you can see Ma was just as uh just\nwe were losing that camera for a hot\nsecond there. She was really kind of\ndigging in there and and starting to\nsplit things. And now you see things\nstarting to be kind of lined out there\nat the front and uh still still most\nriders in the mix. A couple you can see\nin the in the dust there. So, obviously\nthat moisture not tamping everything\ndown, but uh doing a doing a reasonable\njob out there of of killing that dust\njust a little bit as we uh try and looks\nlike uh\ntrying to figure out does look like the\nwomen's field I believe we're looking at\nright now. So, no no no breakaways just\nyet in the women's field as everyone's\nstill still all together.\n&gt;&gt; And Ma is someone who's not part of the\nlifetime lifetime Grand Prix series. So,\nshe's here just as a standalone, you\nknow, event today.\n&gt;&gt; And she'll have some teammates though\nwith like a a Sarah Sturm and and and by\nteammate I I mean that, you know, a few\nof them share some some of their bigger\nsponsors. Uh, and so it's not like\nthey're teammates necessarily at every\nsingle race all through the year or\nwhatnot. But again, there are certain\nathletes out here who are forming\nalliances and will be willing to go to\nthe front uh for someone else who's\nmaybe in the Grand Prix and helping them\nwith their overall series placing. Here\nwe're back to the men.\n&gt;&gt; We've got a couple uh I believe this is\nsome chasers out here right now.\n&gt;&gt; It's Brendan Johnson.\nand trying to get a a visual of the\nsecond rider checking the that's Kobe\nFreeburn.\nThose two having just a little chat\nbefore diving very cautiously into that\nquick right left right now. So, two\nriders now on the Jace Freeburn taking\nhis pull on the front.\nLet's see if we can't see the leading\ntrio in front of them.\nToday's race update brought to you by\nRoad ID. Once again, a reminder, our\nlive coverage today brought to you by\nOrange Seal. And we are now going to\nthrow to Nat Ross.\nOrange Seal out in the field. We are at\nthe tech vehicle. And guess what? Mile\n29 Whistling Springs Brewery. There is a\nsharp right-hand turn that they\nencounter and a nice downhill of chunk.\nWe uh can see rounding this corner.\nThese speeds have been about 30 mph. You\nguys have been tracking it. The highest\nspeeds rolling into this and then\npositioning into a narrow downhill and\nthis is that point where they're\nprobably not taking the feeds. Okay,\nWilson tosses the bottle. Beers leads\nhim down. Riley Amos talked to him last\nnight. He was ready to not even take the\nfeeds because he knew this was going to\nbe a sprint. Uh that's quite the gap\ngoing into this. These guys have exactly\nwhat they need to make it. So if you're\nclosing this gap at this point, you're\nnot stopping in this aid station and you\nare firing on through. The pace on this\npavement and tarmac is a nice reprieve.\nSo Matt grabbing that bottle. Perfect\ntime to do it. This is mile 29. This is\nthe business end.\nStill waiting for that chase to come\nthrough. I know we had a local in there,\nOakley Griffith. So someone that\nactually knows the roads is really nice\nto have out there because this course is\npandemonium from this point on. If\nthey're going through and expecting a\nfeed, this is a neutral support as well\nas we've had a lot of pro mechanics and\nswanies go down into that zone, but\nthey're ready to head to the finish\nafter this. It is such a short,\ncondensed, chaotic race that the racers\nare taking on the nutrition on their own\nand have to take care of all the\nelements. Looks like our chase is quite\na ways behind. So, somebody up front, if\nit was Beers or Wilson, because Riley's\njust sitting in doing his thing, has\nbeen putting down some wattage. So, the\nlead moto has gone through for this\nchase group. And this chase is going to\nbe one long string with several groups\ncoming into it. Uh, orange helmet up in\nthe front and our four riders.\nPacing one of the ones along with check\nout Finy leading this downhill. Uh,\nGriffin in there as well, Pac. So, three\nriders in this group that know this\nterrain trying to get away. And here is\nKeegan and Posi.\nReally tight corner. You can see Simone\ngoing into that. The brakes are on at\ntop of this. The bottom of this feed\nzone is going to be insane. So, they do\na sharp left. So, let's go back to you,\nBill and Meredith.\nRoad ID. All right, we're looking back\non our women's group right now.\nOne rider there. I believe that's our\nwomen's group. One rider just heading\ndirectly into the eye of the storm up\nthere.\n&gt;&gt; That is what we have been talking about\nthese past few days with the weather\nforecasts predicting extreme or severe\nthunderstorms today, which is why the\nrace was cut from 100 miles to 50 miles\nfor rider safety. Making sure everybody\nout there racing today gets off the\ncourse safely.\nStill trying to get a a a visual, but\nthis is, I believe, the the lead woman\ngoing into the Whistling Springs aid\nstation. So, this is right around mile\n29. So, we'll see uh what happens as the\nwomen come through this aid station.\nThis is a fast descent typically in the\npast. See, you can see how how the\nspeeds are coming fast. Almost missing\nthis turn here coming into the aid\nstation. All right, we're actually going\nto throw it out to Lauren Hall for an\nupdate out there on the course.\n&gt;&gt; Bill Meredith, we are here at the feed\nzone, Whistling Springs, and just over\nmy cameraman's shoulder is the storm\ncoming in. You can hear thunder in the\ndistance, and we know that these women\nare going to come through here at\nlightning speed. We just had the men\nroll through. You can hear how fast they\nare, the gravel on those tires. They're\nflying. And I think you guys were\nactually talking that they were doing\naround 23 mph for the men's race. That\nis unheard of. They are blazing through\nhere. And also the talk out here, people\nare really liking this dynamic of a\n50-mi race. It changes everything. The\nshakeup, it's great. And some of the\nathletes really loved it pre-race and\nsome were really, really nervous. And\nwe're out in the race here. Our lead\nmoto coming through right now.\nWomen are flying through, not even\ntaking a bottle. right here.\nMa Frell leading this charge. Sophia\nGomez Vishafany grabbing a bottle.\nMelissa missing her bottle. Lauren\nStevens right behind her.\nSingle file indicates fast racing.\nHigh speed. Some grabs, some not. And\nit's interesting to see who grabs and\nwho doesn't.\nMore coming through.\nWow. Wow. Wow. So fast. Ellen Campbell\njust off the back right there.\nThis is a dynamic race. I love the\ntechnicality of all of this and how this\nis going to play out for the Lifetime\nGrand Prix standings today\nguys. Back to you.\nOh my gosh, you guys. That was, let me\ntell you, a feed zone is always crazy,\nbut a feed zone at this pace on gravel\nroads is also, it just adds a whole\nanother element dynamic to it. It I'm\nglad to see everybody got through safely\ncuz it's not unusual to see crashes\ngoing through the through the feed zone,\nbut we got everyone in and out quickly\nhere and uh the women are absolutely\nflying. Well, we've got another guest in\nour studio now here as we get down to\nthe closing a little bit of the final\nstop of the 2025 Lifetime at Grand Prix.\nRound number six here at Big Sugar\nGravel. We've got none other than the\npresident of Lifetime Events, Kimo\nSeymour in here with us today. Kimmo,\nit's uh you opened the door a minute ago\nand it's it looks a little rainy out\nthere, man.\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's everything we expected. You\nknow, we had to make some adjustments\ntoday. Uh good morning, Meredith. Good\nmorning, Bill, by the way. had to make\nsome tough had to make a real tough call\nthis morning uh knowing that we had some\npretty severe weather coming in this\nafternoon to to obviously shorten the\nevent and uh and it's it's it's coming\nto reality here. I just came in from the\nfinish line. It's absolutely dumping\nrain. You can see Matt Beers here off\nthe front. He is riding into that\nrainstorm that's kind of that cell\nthat's moving over this area. and uh it\nwas just going to be a little too risky\nto have you know you know 800 to 1,000\nmile riders plus all of our pro athletes\nobviously but you know especially those\nage group athletes way out you know 30\n40 m north of town when a storm like\nthis rolls through it was just just too\nrisky and we had to do the had to make\nthe safety call which isn't always the\nfun call to make but uh we think we made\nthe right decision and here here it is\nit just showed up. Yeah, I think you\nknow a lot of the pro athletes are used\nto probably riding in adverse\nconditions. They race so often that you\ncan't avoid it. So they're used to it,\nbut as you said, I mean the age groupers\nare not used to this. And most days\nthey'd look outside and they're like,\nI'm not going to go out in this where\nthe pros are like, I've got to train\ntoday. So, you know, it is what it is.\nBut here we are with the women's race\nand this is Melissa Rollins and I\nbelieve Gibson off the front of this\nrace. Um, oh no, I believe that's Maddie\nMonrose, right? um and uh you know\ntaking taking the rate they're they're\nnot they don't want to sit in anymore\nand so with Melissa who is in the\nLifetime Grand Prix sitting third\noverall two points behind Cesaly Decker\nI'm curious to see what's going to\nhappen behind because Cesley cannot Yep.\nHere we go. She cannot let Melissa up\nthe road. And this is, I think, what\nwe're going to see all the way to the\nfinish line right now is Melissa and\nCesily, they're marking each other, just\nthey're just waiting for one or the\nother to attack. Um, and to see who\nmight be the strongest one up climb.\nSure enough, that was Cesily closing\nthat gap. And she's like, \"Oh, no you\ndon't, Melissa. I'm bringing you right\nback.\" And Maddie still on the front,\nhead down, just going for it.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, looking again at Matt Beers. Tell\nyou what, he's looks like he's got that\ngrin going on. He's looking over having\na little chat with the moto driver\nthere. Again, he's very, very close to\nthe finish. Probably about a mile or so\nfrom the finish right now. Just uh I\nthink making his way up that final climb\nactually right now. So, he's going to be\ndumping out to the line here momentarily\nas we look back on our women's field.\nand they too have uh ridden their way\ninto the eye of the storm and things\nstarting to get a little single file as\nthe riders try and take advantage of the\nchaos that this storm is bringing and uh\ntry and maybe create a little bit of\nseparation there. And we're seeing\nLauren de Cresenzo on the front, which\nat this point in the race um she she is\nnot a sprinter and she will admit that\nevery day, every minute of the race. But\num so it is to her advantage that she\ngoes to the front, really tries to\nstring things out, maybe forms a little\nbit of a break, has some riders that she\ncan work with into the finish line. Uh\nshe is likely not going to to beat\nanyone in a sprint, so the fewer riders\nthat come to the finish line with her,\nthe better for her. And uh Lauren de\nChryseno is currently sitting ninth\noverall. And those top nine in the\nwomen's race are all still pretty close.\nAnd anyone from like well second to\nninth can still finish within that top\nfive to get that automatic qualification\nfor next year.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's so many so many layers to\nthis one today. I kind of love it. It's\na a very tactical battle and back there\nin the women's race, you know, again, we\nsaw some attacks earlier trying to sus\nthings out. But right now, we're back on\nMatt Beers as he's now officially up\ninto town here.\nLooking at maybe this is one of our\nchasers I believe that we've got eyes on\nat the moment. Uh also down there just\nabout a mile and a half from the finish\nthere. Just one final climb to go up the\nhill into town proper as we try and get\nour eyes on that number. But uh now\nwe're again we're going to go to Matt\nBeards because he's now within the\nfencing here in the final straight. So\nthe man out of South Africa had a rough\nday last weekend in Little Sugar, but\nhe's going to make amends here today in\nBig Sugar Gravel. Your winner, the final\nstop of the Grand Prix this year. Matt\nBeers across the line. And I don't think\nhe minds getting soaked by champagne.\nJust blending in with a little bit of\nrain water there. A great ride by Matt\nBeers in just about 2 hours and 11\nminutes or so. So about 23 or so miles\nan hour he runs for cover just uh around\nthe corner there in the press area. So\nMatt Beers a phenomenal ride out there\nfrom very early on. He had the company\ninitially of Riley Amos and Matt Wilson,\nbut both those two riders fell off the\npace somewhere along the way. Matt Beers\nwith the solo win. And we're now looking\nat our chase group. And uh these guys\nare about a mile and a half out. We\nbelieve there's actually one rider in\nfront of them. We're not sure who that\none chaser is, but uh we see the field\ncoming. We know there's one chaser uh a\nlittle bit farther ahead. We're going to\ntry and identify them as they make their\nway to the line as we we're getting\nanother look at Matt Beers there. all\nsmiles in the media tent. Finally\nlocking up a big win here to uh to close\nout his 2025 Lifetime Grand Prix series.\nSo we believe that's going to be Riley\nAmos getting up there for second spot.\n&gt;&gt; I think he was third actually.\n&gt;&gt; There was the one rider that was ahead.\nSo\n&gt;&gt; yeah, we'll try and get those results as\nquickly as possible. And uh\n&gt;&gt; but again th those those finishing\nresults matter for the day for the one\nevent at Big Sugar today. But then we\nalso are looking at the results for the\noverall. So with Cam\n&gt;&gt; finishing in front of Keegan, Toby, and\nSimone,\nI believe that should put him in the\noverall lead\n&gt;&gt; of the series. All right, we're going to\ngo back to our man Nat Ross at the\nfinish line for the interviews of the\nmen's race.\n&gt;&gt; First of all, I didn't want to There was\ntwo like gravel descents right in the\nbeginning and I I didn't want to be near\nthe back on that. I just absolutely sent\nit on the front and made sure I was\nright at the front and then yeah, Cam\nthrew a few attacks right in the\nbeginning and then I went with Matthew\nWilson and Riley Amos and yeah, the\nelastic broke uh on little little sugar\nroad and that was probably about 5 miles\nin or so and yeah, we just I said we\njust keep it on, man. And um it slowly\nwent out slowly slowly. And yeah, I I\nsaid we just need to bank on them kind\nof negative racing because they're all\ngoing to look at each other with the\npoints and stuff. And uh there was one\nmoment where we thought we would get\ncaught again. Got pretty close. And then\num but I know like if you just keep the\npressure on, you should.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. But we had a great cohesion\nbetween Riley, Matt, and myself. And uh\nyeah, it was a privilege being with\nthose boys. You're trying to That might\nbe Is that Lauren Dresenzo? I think on\nthe front maybe. I think you're right.\n&gt;&gt; Just watching her body language and her\npedaling style. That That definitely\nlooks like her.\n&gt;&gt; Uh and she's\n&gt;&gt; not really attacking. Just kind of\nsetting the tempo right now. Trying to\ndig in hard, but still those four riders\nstill together. I believe that's going\nto be Sophia Gomez, Vishafany on her\nwheel. You could see I think uh that was\nLauren Stevens maybe taking a look back\nover her shoulder there. And that chase\ngroup, I mean, they look so close, but\nhere goes the move by Stevens. So, just\nas they hit the bottom pitch of the very\nfinal climb here as they go under the\npath. Lauren Stevens throwing down a big\nmove. We're going to see if this does\nany kind of damage. Sophia now taking\nover the pacemaking. So, Sophia Gomez,\nVisha looking like maybe she's getting a\nlittle bit of daylight here, Meredith.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think you're right. Obviously,\nwe know Sophia is on good form right\nnow. She always is. uh coming off a big\nwin at Little Sugar last weekend, just\nabsolutely dominating that race for\nalmost from beginning to end. Looks like\nLauren Stevens is trying to get back on\nthe wheel of Sophia against Sophia\nalready has the overall series locked\nup. So, her win today is a great win,\nbut it's it's meaningful for the day,\nnot the series. Lauren Stevens behind\nher is not in the Grand Prix. So, again,\nshe's looking for a result on the day\nthat won't impact the overall series.\nAnd look at the gap they have pulled out\nright now. So the very big gap. Sophia\nGomez, Visha Fier, your leader. She's in\nthe red and the blue with that white\nhelmet as she makes her way up. If that\ncamera spins around, we know that this\nterrain is going to level out here any\nmoment. The grade right now only about\n3% maybe at most before it levels out\nfor maybe a block. The road will bend to\nthe right. And you know, maybe Sophia,\nyou wonder if she caught word that her\nteammate Matt Beers took a win. So, this\ncould be a wonderful day for the\nSpecialized Squad. And excuse me, to\nwhat an exclamation point on the overall\nlifetime Grand Prix series here if\nSophia Gomez V. Shafany can take out the\nfinal wind while holding on to yet\nanother overall series title here. And\nI'll tell you, Lauren Stevens given\neverything she can, but she's just not\nmaking up any real estate right now.\nShe's staying just close enough that\nSophia is continuing to look back under\nher shoulder. She knows she's there. She\ncan probably hear her back there for\nthat matter. So Sophia again looking\nback, she knows she can't give up. She\nwants to take a deep breath. She wants\nto kind of reset for just a second there\nas she makes that right-hander. Now\nshe's going to make a left turn onto\nMain Street right now. So she's going to\nbe able to see the finish line as she\nbegins her acceleration. I'll tell you\nwhat, she's starting to pull out a\nlittle more gap. You've got just this\ntiny little upgrade here before it\nlevels out again and almost downhill to\nthe line. And Sophia Gomez, Visha Fier,\nshe is going to the well for everything\nshe's got right now. She's just about to\ncome inside the fencing. So the final\ncouple hundred meters. And Sophia Gomez\nVisha looks like she's going to cap off\nthe 2025 a lifetime Grand Prix with a\nvery emphatic win here. So Sophia Gomez\nVisha will be your women's champion here\nin the final stop of the Lifetime Grand\nPrix here at Lifetime Big Sugar Gravel\npresented by Kinetic.\n&gt;&gt; That was a fa fantastic ride by Sophia\nuh followed by Lauren Stevens there and\nthe group coming in h for the sprint. Um\nso hard to see who it was coming in.\nWe'll we've got to wait to see how the\nfinish happened between uh Melissa and\nCesily, but you can see the pain on\nSophia's face right there.\n&gt;&gt; Today's leaderboard is brought to you by\n&gt;&gt; Both of those riders absolutely\nincredible at taking long long going\nfrom from the long distance and being\nout alone on the roads and you know they\nthey're used to these hard efforts at\nthe end of the day. Well, I'll tell you\nwhat. We are going to move over to the\nfinish line with Lauren Hall for our\nrider interviews.\n&gt;&gt; I thrive in chaos and with the\nuncertainty. Are we racing 100? Are we\nracing 50? Although I was praying we\nwere going to do the 50, I thought it\nwould just deliver some really exciting\nracing and yeah, it was chaos for 50\nmiles, attacks going left and right and\ncame down to the wire. Now, let's take a\nlook at our lifetime Grand Prix. Final\nstandings for the men presented by\nKinetic.\nWith a big push on the final day, Cam\nJones takes home top honors in first\nplace. Simone Po in second. Toby Rhde\ncoming home in third place. Keegan\nSwenson, the multi-time winner of the\nLifetime Grand Prix, comes home in\nfourth this year. Matt Beers in fifth\nplace. Alexi Vermullen in sixth place.\nWe had a two-way tie for seventh, but\nAndrew Lebron wins that tiebreaker to\ncome home in seventh. Braden Lang in\neighth. Brendan Johnson in ninth, and\nCole Patton rounds out your top 10.\nLet's take a look at our Lifetime Grand\nPrix final standings for our women\npresented by Kinetic. Once again, Sophia\nGomez, Visha tops the list, taking the\noverall win. Cesley Decker comes home in\nhis second. Meisa Rollins rounds out\nyour top three. In fourth, Alexis\nScarta. Fifth place goes to Cecil Lune.\nIn sixth, Lauren Dresenzo.\nIn seventh, breaking a three-way tie\nbecause today is the tie breaker.\nCourtney Sherwell. In eighth, Hannah\nOtto. In ninth, Haley Pin. And in 10th\nplace, Sarah Lang. A big thanks to our\nfriends at Orange Seal for bringing the\nlive coverage of our event out here.\nSome wonderful coverage throughout the\nseason.

      "transcript": "Big Sugar 2025. We are out here. We've\nbeen here for the last few days talking\nwith pros, non-pros alike about the\ncourse, the changes, the rain, the\npotential like tornado that people were\nworried about happening. The race got\nshortened from 100 miles to 50 mi. I\nhave the top bikes, the top finishers,\nand their setups. I'm going to walk you\nthrough all of them, and we're going to\ntalk about perhaps a little bit of what\nwe might start seeing next year in the\nLifetime Grand Prix and the elites in\nthe gravel space. Let's talk about the\nrace. So for the elites, Big Sugar\nGravel was going to be 100 m and about\n6,000 ft at the last moment due to an\ninclement crazy storm that people\nworried about being a tornado\npotentially or a tornado warning. The\nrace got shortened to 50 miles and so\nthat means carnage especially if there's\ngoing to be rain. A couple things to\nnote about Big Sugar Gravel. typically\nhas a reputation for being like a\ncategory 2 or category 3 type of gravel\nsituation with the rocks being\nparticularly sharp. We saw in the\nprevious week a little sugar that there\nwere a ton of flats and so we are\nexpecting some flats to be out here\ntoday talking to some pros. They are\ngoing for definitely a more\nenduranceoriented casing if they could\nhelp it. Just like any other big sugar\nrace, this race is going to be pretty\ndarn punchy. For the most part, this\n50-mi course is actually a lot smoother\nthan the 100 mile course was. At least\nthat's what the pros are telling me. And\nso, as a result, there were fewer flats\nthan we would have expected. A lot of\nfolks out here, it was a question of\nwhat tire they were going to run. I\nthink most pros were kind of just locked\nin regardless of whether they were going\nto have a 100 mile ride or a 50-mi ride.\nThey knew that there's going to be some\nsort of rain. And for a brief moment, at\nleast in the men's and women's races\nalike, there was quite a bit of moisture\nout there. You'd think that the last\nrace of the year would be calm. This\nyear it was anything but. On the men's\nside, the top four finishes were\nseparated by just two points. You had\nKeegan Swinson coming in one point ahead\nof second and third place. And then you\nhad fourth place just two points behind\nKeegan himself. Fifth place is also\npretty darn contested. There were just a\nfew points behind there. Fifth place\ngets you an automatic entry in the\nLifetime Grand Prix. So that was going\nto be hotly contested as well. On the\nwomen's side, it wasn't quite as tight,\nbut you still had a question of who\ncould have finished first. if there was\ngoing to be a mechanical. Simone Pelode,\nyou had Torbjion and Andre Rowit. You\nhad Cam Jones and Keegan Swinson all\nkind of looking around at one another\ntrying to figure out who was going to go\nfirst. What Cam told me and actually I'm\ngoing to let you see that right here.\n&gt;&gt; I have no idea what happened out there.\nWhat was what was going on in the last\nlittle bit?\n&gt;&gt; There were people that weren't in the\nrunning for the overall just attacking\nthe whole time.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Like there's a few sort of like\nlower top 10 people attack and\n&gt;&gt; they were marked by people that they\nwere concerned with. I only had to watch\nfour or three people. So I was there\nlike I think I was taking on the race\nmore than most. I was I was really I had\nlike half dozen attacks and tried like\nKeegan went full gas every climb and I\nwas wise to it just on his wheel and it\ntook a few flyers in the flat but just\nmade sure I was positioned at the front\nand never had to accelerate more than\nhad to to to close gaps.\n&gt;&gt; He was the first person to go any of\nthose four\n&gt;&gt; had a good lead out and then Keegan went\nand I followed him. Yeah, I was straight\non his wheel and came around him and\nyeah, it was a long sprint, but yeah,\nwith everything that was on the line,\ntake the go as deep as I could.\n&gt;&gt; I guess the the big question I have here\nis a question of late night preparation.\nIt felt like I was hearing two different\nraces people were preparing for cuz they\nweren't sure if it was going to be a 50\nor 100. Was that what was going on for\nyou?\n&gt;&gt; Oh, I downloaded the 50 course last\nnight, but didn't really look at it.\nYeah,\n&gt;&gt; suspected it was a bit less technical,\nbut yeah,\n&gt;&gt; don't think I would have changed\nanything if I had more time. 50 is\nplenty of volume. So, yeah, I was I\ntried a 50 in the back, but it wasn't\nworth the risk of rubbing.\n&gt;&gt; Something went wrong with the wheel\n&gt;&gt; season. Is there anything that you're\ncurious to dig into? Seeing Ryan Sandish\non a on a scale?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I've got I've got the parts for a\ndrop mountain bike. So, I got like a 90\nmil like adjustable angle stem. So, I\nmight slap that on the the pull s and\nsee how that goes.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uh suspension fork on\nthis at all. Is that worth\n&gt;&gt; I've actually got a suspension fork on\nmy Scott addic gravel back home. So,\nhave a go with that.\n&gt;&gt; If you do a suspension fork, do you\nstick with a tire as wide as this or do\nyou go narrower? Do you\n&gt;&gt; once?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. The theory is you don't need as\nbig a tire. But\n&gt;&gt; congratulations again.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; All right. Specialized crux. This is the\nbike Sophia Gomez Vija. This is the bike\nthat she's been riding basically all\nyear long. And she's been on a tear\nafter winning Little Sugar last week and\nthen Big Sugar this past weekend.\nSpecialized repeated Reval repeated\ncockpit two-piece system right here.\nArrow stiff works well. Specialized\nTracer 50 mil tires front and rear. 46\nto chain ring with a 10 to 52 to\ncassette. The big thing here, Reval\nunreleased\nTerra Gravel carbon wheels with carbon\nspokes. what we presume them to be\nbecause they have the same spoke system\nthat you find on the new Revolve Repeat\nCLX3s that have the carbon spokes.\nThere's also an updated hub here that\nappears to be shared with the Repeat\nCLX3 as well. That's the big thing that\nwe noticed here from before. This is a\nSpecialized Sorks power saddle and it's\nnot the new Power Evo saddle, but\nobviously this is working well for her.\nWhy change that? Perhaps the more\ninteresting bike setup right here. This\nis Matt Beers who won the men's version\nof the race right here. And he's on an\nunreleased wheel set as well, but this\none is completely new to Specialized. It\nlooks like it's going to be called the\nRevolve Terra Arrow wheel. It looks\ndeeper. Specialized Pathfinder 50 mil\ntires front and rear. But these Terra\nArrow CLX wheels are going to have\ncarbon spokes, it appears, as well as\nthe updated hub.\nSecond place in the Elite Women's went\nto Lauren Stevens. This is the bike\nwe've already seen, but with the new\nShimano wireless drivetrain, XTRD2 rear\nderailer with the 10 to 51 XTR cassette\nwith the Dura Ace crank and then the\nWolftooth Aero chain ring. Envy SCES 3.4\nwheels, Victoria Peyote 2.25 wheel tire\nin this Ventm GS1. That is pretty\nimpressive to see on a bike like this.\nAnd then you have the Envy cockpit. And\nthen in the back you have a Victoria\nTorino T50 tire, 50 mil width in the\nback here. Perhaps a little bit more\nthan other gravel races. I'm seeing\nriders like Lauren Stevens here with\nthis wo mag saddle, but also with a top\ntube bag for snacks or what have you.\nThis was a short race, but you know, you\ngot to have your stuff somewhere. And\nso, it makes sense to have them here.\nThis is that arrow chain rings. It's a\n46 tooth right here with the cutout\nspecifically so you can have that power\nmeter pod right there for these Dur\ndual-sided power meter cranks. Overall,\nI think this is a good-look bike. Stars\nand stripes suit her pretty well. Quick\nshout out to third place elite women's\nfinisher Stella Hobbs who did this on\nher mother's birthday. This is a red\nAxis 1x12 drivetrain, 10 to 52 to\ncassette crank brothers cranks right\nhere. Envy bars, Envy SCS 3.4 wheels,\nand then the 50 mil wide Specialized\nTracer tires as well. This is the Envy\nSCS AR bar. Even though it's a little\nbit out of focus, I'm going to tell you\nright now, this is a bar that you see\npretty common amongst the elites here. I\nthink it's a great handlebar. 46 to\nchain ring for Stella Hobbs here.\nQuick note to Keegan Swinson right here\nwho is extremely aggressive on the day\naccording to other racers right here. 45\nmil Maxis Rambler tires front and rear\nwith a 12speed drivetrain. Everything\nelse relatively stock. Russell Finerwald\nsaid he brought a whole bunch of tires\nthe night before. However, he ended up\non the now discontinued Conti Race King\n2.2 in the front and the Terra hard pack\nin the back and a 50 mil. Trek claims a\n45 mil max tire clearance for its\nCheckmate. Obviously, there's a little\nbit more clearance here. Julian Gier\ncame to a tightly contested fourth place\nfinish on his Da Vinci Hatchet Pro that\nhas a 45 mil tire clearance as well.\nHowever, he's got a Maxis Aspen ST up\nfront and the 45 mil tire in the back.\nStram red access 1x13 Explore drivetrain\nin the back with a 10 to 46 to cassette\nand the Wolftooth chain catcher right\nhere. 46 to chain ring as I mentioned\nright here. He is maximizing every bit\nof clearance that this bike has to\noffer. It is pretty road bike like and\nthat is something that he even said\nright here. And as you can see right\nhere, not a lot of tire clearance right\nhere. But as you can see, you could fit\nan Aspen ST in that 2.1 in or about 55\nmil width right here. My favorite part\nright here is this Shimano XTR pedal\nright here that he removed half a side\nto, so is only able to clip in on one\nside. Now, I do want to mention Sarah\nStern bike. She finished seventh on the\nday on the Specialized Diverge. She's\nthe only Specialized pro rider to be on\nthe Diverge this weekend. It's\ninteresting because she actually found\naccording to her that she really was\nhappy to have the Future Shock there and\nthe extra comfort and control that she\nfelt that it offered. And then the\nbike's a little bit extra weight for\nher. She's relatively lightweight and so\nit brought her a lot more control on\nthose fastest scents that she wasn't\nentirely familiar with. Otherwise, this\nis set pretty familiar with the Zip\n303SW wheels with the Tracer tires and a\n50 mil width front and rear. And then\nthe 12-speed Stram drivetrain here with\na 46 to chain ring and the 10 to 52 to\ncassette.\nCaleb Schwarz finished sixth on the day\noutsprinting a bunch of the Lifetime\nGrand Prix guys in a critical race for\nthem to finish sixth on the day on this\nMandreaker aired Carbon Schwabby\nThunderbirds 2.1 in front and rear. The\nMandreaker here has a 50 mil tire\nclearance front and rear and so it makes\nsense to see that. Here you have a Stram\nXX1x12 drivetrain with the Wolftoothoth\nAero chain ring and the Stram red access\nchain rings. Schwabby says that their\ngravel tires are purpose-made for this\ntype of thing, but he's still out here\non the Thunderbirds. That's it everyone.\nIf you have any questions, let us know\nin the comments down below. We have a\nlot more photos and details to come up\ndown. We'll link it down below as well.\nAnd that's it from Bentonville,\nArkansas. The season is over with the\nLifetime Grand Prix and I'm ready for a\nbreak. See you on the next one."

and\nMelissa Rollins your 2024 lead Bill\nChampion both of these women are only a\ncouple points behind so if Paige wants\nto hold on to her spot she's going to\nhave to fend off some formidable\ncompetitors in today's\nrace so we're really excited to um have\n2500 Riders touch down in Bonville and\ntake on big sugar gravel\nall right thank you Kimo and welcome to\nrace day here in Bentonville as our\nElite Fields start to gather in the\nCorral for the start of big sugar\ngravel as chemo just alluded to we have\nsome exciting things happening in the\nlifetime Grand Prix overall standings\nthat will all get decided out on the\ncourse today let's check out the overall\nleaderboard brought to you by sbl\nas we heard Keegan has this thing locked\nup so your Grand Prix Champion will be\ntaking a Victory lap here today but\nbehind him every Point counts you've got\npacon Matt beers Cole and the 2024\nUnbound gravel Champion Lan Morton all\nwithin eight points of each other and\nthere's no shortage of Heavy Hitters\nbehind them either so the pressure\nreally could come from\nanywhere similarly for the women first\nplace is already decided but there's\nonly nine points between paig John\nWeller in second and Hannah in six so\nagain with so much money on the line you\nknow the competition is going to be\nfierce today there will be no\ncomplacency and for one last time this\nseason these athletes are going to push\nthemselves to the breaking\npoint whoever can\nendure whoever can sit with the pain and\nembrace it whoever can outwit his or her\nopponents and save that last little bit\nof themselves for those final moments\nthis is the person that will get the top\nspot on the\npodium and all the glory that comes with\nit so without further Ado let's kick\nthis thing\noff well good morning Janelle here we\nare at the uh 2024 lifetime Big Sugar\nclassic presented by Mazda excited to\nkick off the race this morning we're\ngoing to have a great day we're watching\nthe sun come up over the Ozarks from\nbville\nArkansas and the men are about to go\noff the big sugar course is notoriously\nunpredictable there's a lot of variables\nwhich is exciting you can be the\nstrongest and still lose this race\nthere's a lot of money on the line\nthere's a lot of Pride on the line these\nguys are going to be gunning for it I\nmean Keegan is Keegan he's the top but\nlike to be the Sky I think it holds a\npretty decent weight in terms of that\nPrestige 2 1 we\nare and the men are\noff second most of the year and so I've\ngotten a little bit emotionally attached\nto that spot I'm really motivated from\nthat standpoint to try to fight off Matt\nand hang on the second so we're just\nleaving town it's neutral for about five\nmiles Riders are going to be looking to\nburn off some of the nerves that they've\ndefinitely got going through their\nbodies I'm not out there to like figure\nout this whole points battle and I mean\nobviously it's in the back of your mind\nbut it I think it's easier if you\nrace such a gnarly gravel race\neverything they have and race with all\nall their hearts and that's what's going\nto make it such an exciting\nday as the men are making their way out\nof Bentonville still in that controlled\nstart let's go back to the start line as\nthe women are now ready to get things\ngoing this is the final race and I think\nall of our bodies are tired I know that\nmy body has definitely been asking for\nsome rest for longer than I've wanted it\nto be asking for it back at the start\nline and we've got a power pack group\nhere with the women every start line\nfeels like a battle this one's going to\nfeel like\none we are\n[Applause]\noffici there's big money on the line\nhere Sophia Gomez vishaan in that white\nhelmet she's still here to race even\nthough she's got this wrapped up she\nstill wants to win ever the competitor\nfirst place is locked up but beyond that\nthere's a lot of opportunity to her left\nyou see uh Melisa Rollins Melissa's\nhaving a phenomenal year winning\nLeadville the wide open this is it a\nreally really good race or a big bom of\nrace could throw your whole standings\nfor a major curveball this is about the\ndriest and dustiest we've seen the\ncourse here at Big Sugar the last few\nyears so they're all talking about that\ndust and how it's going to impact the\nrace I think being near the front in the\nfirst third of the race is going to be\nreally important I think for me\npersonally I don't have a lot to lose\nbut I have a lot to gain so I think\nyou're going to see some aggressive\nracing and as our Elite men and Elite\nwomen begin their day in the Ozarks it's\ntime to check in with Michelle Duffy\nwith our big sugar classic course\nbreakdown Big Sugar gravel starts and\nends in Bentonville\nArkansas from town Riders will head West\nas they begin the 100 mile Loop through\nthe Ozark\nMountains this is going to be fast\naggressive racing constant climbing\ndescents blind turns really rough\ngravel it's a tree canopy covered course\nwhich creates a really beautiful\nenvironment but that also cast Shadows\nacross the course you mix that with a\nbunch of dust getting kicked up and it\ncan make it hard to see where you're\ngoing at Mile 37 Riders will hit the\nfirst aid station at Pineville that's\nwhere things really start to get spicy\nand super challenging there's a series\nof Rolling Hills straight out of\nPineville it's just hard and constant\nthere is no time to get distracted out\nthere at Mile 73 they're going to enter\nWhistling Springs which is a brewery we\nsee the 50 MERS out there you know\nhanging at the farm drinking beers and\nthese 100 MERS are just going to Barrel\nthrough they're going to race hard and\nthey're going to race aggressive and\nfast and that's going to come with\nattrition too inevitably flat tires are\nthe day Ender here more than any other\nevent the final leg of the race consists\nof open roads and a tactical approach\ngravel gives way to Pavement as the\nRiders approach Bentonville where a\nfinal climb offers one last chance to\ncreate some separation before a Sprint\ndown Main Street ultimately decides the\nwinner of Lifetime Big Sugar\ntravel okay thank you Michelle now we\nhave Tim Johnson on the ground with the\nmen's field as they are leaving the\npavement for the dusty gravel roads\nhow's it looking down there Tim all\nright we're getting close to the first\ngravel section is like Mad Max we're out\non course first few miles have been\naction-packed at the front but I got to\nsay this course really delivers we are\nstill in the early miles really rough\nreally\nRocky over 7,000 ft of elevation gain in\nthis race but it comes in short spurts\nracing the series like time Grand Prix\nis a constant mind game we've got Matt\nbeers off the front here chasing the uh\nthe lead Moto and aggressive early solo\nattack he was second last week at the\nlifetime Little Sugar Mountain bik in a\nin a Sprint and uh he is on great form\nright now at the you know coming into\nthe end of the season and so when you're\nin that moment you're in the race it's\nlegs it's fuel it's tactics and it\nforces you to think constantly the\nmental side is almost harder than the\nphysical side Mo this is Redemption for\nhis crash early into this race last year\nin 2023 rer we just had a just there\nrers who went down looks like Matt beers\nis down I haven't actually finished this\nrace because last year I got taken out\nseparated my shoulder and all that but I\nmean there's no champagne gravel it's\nchunky and it's Relentless out\nthere so Matt beers is looking for\nredemption in the first 20 miles of the\nrace Finster wal went with him but it\nlooks like he decided he wasn't quite\nready to make that move so he folded\nback into the main group and now it's\nMichael Garrison making the move to join\nMatt as he stays out in\nfront you just need to be at the front\nbut everyone else also wants to do that\nso sometimes lessons are harder than\nothers that was a hard one but it'll pay\ndividends for this race for sure with\nMatt like his engine is so huge that you\ndo not want to let them out of your\nsight we are almost 30 mi into the race\nthick thick in the action right now it\nis you know I think the name of the game\nright now is just to stay in the race\nwell after Matt got out in front sounds\nlike a slight mechanical slowed him down\njust enough that he's been pulled back\ninto that main group leaving Garrison\nsolo so Kimo as we rejoin the men about\n33 miles into the day it looks like\nsomething has happened with Matt beers\nbecause we have a lead group of three\nmen off the front and then our big name\nRacers of the day in this Chase group\nand a man that we've come to know off\nthe front of big sugar John bman\nanimating the race yeah we're seeing one\nof John's trademark moves we saw it like\nas I mentioned earlier probably eight\ntimes last year he uh took a flyer and\ntook a risk and uh he's he's getting to\nbe known for this and uh you can tell\nthe guys there behind him they're\nthey're not content to let him get too\nfar off the front our team caught up\nwith John Borman let's take a closer\nlook at uh at his strategy for these\nflyers off the\nfront we do have someone off the front\nlooks like John borman's taking a little\nbit of a flyer\nhere seems like I have developed\nreputation for always wed to go off the\nfront you know make the early move he's\nuh trying to break weight and see if he\ncan't put a stamp on this race I don't\nwant to be the guy who just sits in all\nday and like incredibly calculated about\nevery little decision\nyou know only working when he has to\nonly covering the moves when he has to\nif I'm going to win I want to do it with\nstyle Forlan back all by himself he's\ngot about a minute and 20 second\nAdvantage right now this sort of long\nrange attack the making the race hard\nall day you know keeping the climbers\nfrom recovering too much on the flats\njust like keeping everybody on edge just\nI just want it to be like an intense\nexperience the whole day long forcan\ntaking rep needed stabs at getting out\nthere solo only to continue to be reeled\nin being part of the game being\ncompetitive but also just like getting\nto witness you know the top level of\ncompetition morelan off the front has\nnow created a 90c\ngap there's nothing quite like being a\npart of the race so like get the full\nexperience of the story of the event and\nnow a black just like that his lead is\ngone it's sort of like a 1 in 10 one in\n100 maybe sort of a a move but\neventually it'll work and when it does\nthen it's kind of\nGlorious we're only a couple miles from\nthe Pineville aid station and as Borlan\nwas reeled back in we have a couple more\nguys making an attack so far in this\nrace the elastic is being tested early\nand often is it going to snap we'll\nrejoin the men on the other side of\nPineville to find out but first let's\nhead back and see how the women are\nfairing through the first third\nmiles Kemo we see the Riders massing at\nthe front making that last minute move\nwhen this road turns to gravel oh as\nwell my gosh Hannah almost went down we\ngot a little Cross of Wheels there and\nHannah almost went down right before\nthey hit the gravel these are those\nmoments in the race it's tense and just\none tap of the brakes can really throw\noff the for\ngot an attack off the left hand side\nchemo would you believe it it's Sophia\nmaking the first significant move of the\nrace Sophia is leading the Grand Prix\nand look at the daylight between her and\nthe rest of the\nfield you can look in the pelaton and\nyou'll see the women giving each other\nsideways glances because they are\nlooking to see who is willing to put in\nthe work to make the next move looks\nlike mods come to the front here going\nto help bring this back and uh p\nonweller as well um they're they're\nthey're not going to let it uh they're\nnot going to let her get very far off\nthe front this early mod has done it\nshe's made the connection with Sophia\nSophia looking around to see if anyone\nelse is coming and it is game\non not even 13 miles into the race and\nthis group is just blown up this women's\nrace is exploded anah hick still trying\nto chase all to the front of this group\nand you know who's back here LDC I would\nhave picked her more towards the front\nof the women's race so maybe got a\nlittle bit called out again it is so\nloose this gravel is just going to freak\nhavoc on these athletes today I think\nthe course is probably the hardest we've\never seen it it's like Moon dust out\nthere dust is pluming up in a way that\nyou can't even see what you're going to\nbe hitting loose dry gravel on the\nuphills you can't really stand up and\npower through some of stuff you have to\nstay seated you have to have that grip\non that rear tire and it is so Rocky and\nloose out\nhere now they've got a little climb here\nto uh group probably come back together\na little bit that is Melisa right on her\nMelisa Rollins she had just a phenomenal\nbreakout event amazing climber I think\nSophia wants to win it's important to\nher to win this race she hasn't won it\nbefore she likes to win things if you\nhaven't\nnoticed Kemo the dynamic that we're\nseeing play out in today's race is going\nto make for an incredibly hard day of\nracing Sophia has been doing a lot of of\nthe animating but it's 105 miles and\nwhen you are attacking and then closing\ngaps it's making for a what will\nprobably be a day of whoever can make\nthe r moves and can serve when it counts\nas the women continue towards Pineville\none thing that is on clear display today\nis the sense of community that we as\ncyclists are fortunate to enjoy\nespecially at events like the big sugar\nclassic one of the riders in the women's\nfield has a unique perspective on\ncycling in the community it affords as\nan owner of the Nicolet Bike Shop in\nMano Minnesota as well as a two-time\nparticipant in the lifetime Grand Prix\nJenna Reinhardt and her husband Justin\nhave been building the cycling community\nin her hometown for the last two decades\nI'm Jenna Reinhardt I own a bike shop\nwith my husband in m bikes are\ncomplicated enough that people still\nreally need us and I think it provides a\nunique experience that you don't get\nvery much in retail anymore our shop has\nactually been around for over 50 years\nmy husband started working for them when\nhe was in high school and then through\ncollege and while we were bike racing\nand going to school we thought that it\nwould be fun to like combine your\npassion with also your career this side\nof bikes feels very different than\nracing so I love having time for both\nand if one's not going as good then I've\ngot the other one done like a lot of\ntraveling around the country and seeing\nhow big the sport was in other areas and\nfelt like we can do that in our\nhometown you know who all the Riders are\nlike we know our customers almost\nsometimes more by their bike that they\nride than their name sometimes oh yeah\nthat's tarmac\nLarry when I go to Bentonville I see\nthat Community that's very familiar to\nwhat we have up here it feels very\nwelcoming and just that Clos community\nand and wanting to share the love of the\nsport last year Jenna finished sixth in\nthe Grand Prix overall currently she is\nin 15th Place so you know she's going to\nbe hustling out there today Kemo and\nJanelle what's the latest with the\nwomen's\nwe're back with the lead women and it it\nlooks as though it's the same group\nlooks to be about uh 12 or 14 women same\nUsual Suspects we saw them all together\nearlier obviously number of attacks took\nplace early on but nobody was able to\nmake it stick so uh these women look\nlike they've sized each other up like a\nfew people have taken a flyer and given\nit a run but haven't had a lot of luck\nso looks like they might be content to\nstay together for this long pavement\nsection through the first uh really the\nfirst aid station Janelle we're a little\nover 2 hours into uh the 202 for\nLifetime Big Sugar classic presented by\nbasda the women have that group of about\nuh 14 seem to be comfortably together\nnobody really seems to be willing to\npush the pace for that group so let's go\nsee how the men are doing they're coming\nup a couple of the biggest climbs of the\nday okay thank you Kimo as we catch back\nup with the men's race let's check out\nthe leaderboard as the men came through\nthe first aid station at Pineville we\nhad a lead group of two Alexis cardier\nand Seaman senson a Chase of two behind\nthem Colby Simmons and Sebastian\nshanberg Cameron Jones Crossing solo\nbehind those guys it's a big chase of\nalmost 30 Riders a bunch of Grand Prix\nriders in there including Matt beers\nKeegan Pac Alexi so I'd say this thing\nis still wide open as the Riders are now\nmaking their way from Pineville towards\nWhistling Springs let's jump back out to\nTim with the latest on the men's\nfield just gone through the the first\nmajor feed the chase group really being\npoliced by Keegan won Matt beers Alexi\nveran Riders really familiar to fans of\nthe lifetime Grand Prix so they have to\ndecide if that Breakaway is going to be\nworth\nchasing but they just don't know and\nthere's still quite a bit of racing\nstill yet to come you kind of figure out\nin races like this who does work who's\nwilling to work consistently now we're\ncaught back up to our lead Riders here\nwe've got Alexis cardier out of Canada\nand Simon nordal senson out of Norway\nway Simon was ninth at Unbound this year\nso we know he can ride this kind of\ncourse looking like it's probably over a\nminute now on a chasing group of Colby\nSimmons and Sebastian shonberg my\nstrategy is to try and get a bit of a\nbit of a gap on where I can and exploit\nthe the fact that these guys don't know\nme that well got two off the front then\ntwo then we've got six and now this\ngroup and look at on the front we're\nseeing Pete STNA and you look at this\ngroup came and we are seeing the big\nnames from the lifetime Grand Prix\nrepresented here in the group I think\nthe best analogy is R band The more you\nstretch it it always comes back together\nbut it starts to come be a little bigger\nand bigger and bigger you know we're\nback to the lead men here and it looks\nas though it's all come back together so\nwhat we're hearing from the elite men is\nthat we have a handful of non- Grand\nPrix Riders taking repeated stabs off\nthe front but this giant Chase group is\nable to keep reeling them back in Alexi\nis one of the Grand Prix riders in that\ngroup he hasn't had the best season by\nhis own standards but you know he is\ngoing to show up for big sugar for a\nlittle more on what his year has\nentailed here's Alexi it's been a long\nseason when you get to the end of a\nseries like this you're running on\nresidual Fitness Alexi veran coming in\nlooks like he's he's given about a\nminute up to pegan but uh he's going to\ncome away with second place points but I\nthink the first year of the Grand Prix I\nlearned a lot just about I want to race\nevery race as hard as I can and how it\nplays out has played out and the first\ntwo years were great for me Schwan and\nthe rad I felt cheated in a sense of\njust like I was really fit things didn't\ngo my way the big question is where is\nAlexi ver Mullan on this Leadville\ncourse at the end of the day no one\ncares it's it's bike racing my goal is\nto race a bike fast um but it's\nfrustrating when you put a lot of things\non the line and you're like I can still\nmake this happen on paper this is a\ngreat race for Alexi however we are not\nseeing him anywhere near the front Group\nafter a second place finish at seot we\nreally have not seen much from him this\nseason in a million years I never would\nhave guessed I'd be 16th in the Grand\nPrix coming into big sugar but that's\nwhere I am after two Flats we are\nhearing Alexi is dropping out of the\nrace here at the rad that it won't\nchange how I race sitting in 16th it's\nnot where I expect it to be but my whole\ngoal is to win the race not the Grand\nPrix on that day will today be Alexis's\nday let's go back down to Tim Johnson\nand get the latest checking in we've got\naction happening in this group\nconstantly attacking chasing coming back\ntogether again you know in a points\nChase series finale that is really\ntough when the group say slows down like\nit's a good moment and then when it's\nbeen hard like and you know everyone's\nsuffering that's that's when yeah that's\nwhen you got to attack and again Colby\nSimmons and Simon senson make an attack\nand this one looks like it could stick\nas they've opened up about a 30se second\nGap and it appears to be\ngrowing there's it's going to be a time\nwhere there's groups up the road and\nit's going to be so easy for people to\nlook at each other and say I'm resting\nthere's 40 m to the Finish I don't need\nto follow this right now and that\nmindset you've already lost the race\nbefore you know it and now Alexi has\nalso gone off the front of the chase\ngroup and is Solo in pursuit of our\nleaders so three Riders out the front\nthe group in full Chase mode trying to\nget back and once again Hill after Hill\nafter\nHill I'm not focused on anybody else I\nwant to race my race whatever that might\nbe the lead men are just a couple miles\naway from the Whistling Springs Brewery\nand Alexi has made contact that was a\nHerculean effort to go off solo and\nclose that Gap we'll be back for the\nmen's finale but first let's check back\nin with the elite women we have a lead\ngroup of 14 as they head into the first\neight station Stella Hobbs is leading\nthe pack followed by Aaron Huck Sophia\nAlexis and Peta rounding out fifth Paige\ncesy Hannah Emily and Melissa make up\nthe top 10\nMichaela Thompson is sitting in 11th\nfollowed by Sarah Flavia LDC and Jenna\nin 15th let's check back with our eyes\nin the sky with an update out in\nPineville as the women make their way\nthrough the first aid station Janelle we\njust rolled into Pineville first aid\nstation on the day been really dry\nreally dusty important that they they\ntake on the nutrition Dell another fun\nfact is as you know we have this year\nall of our lifetime Grand Prix events\nhave had a separate start for the women\ngiven them an opportunity to raise R\nunimpeded by the men unaffected by the\nmen they've all been pretty big fans of\nit pretty pretty exciting to see and the\nbest part about it is they are they are\nstarting to catch some of the pro men\nthat left 10 minutes before them this\nmorning so really cool to see that we've\ngot some of the most competitive women\nin the world all out here and they are\ncatching the proen this the first year\nthat we've really been able to race\namong each other having our own starts\nhas really helped us be highlighted more\nand show the story of our racing a lot\nof us have been racing against each\nother for a long time but we've really\nonly recently been actually racing with\neach other and getting to see kind of\nhow everyone operates check this out I\nmean it is just so dusty and so loose\nthey're kind of all over the place just\ntrying to find that one good line we've\ngot a bigger group now all three Chase\ngroups have come back together Paige\nonwell are sitting second wheel this is\nher hometown race she's had good results\nhere in the past she started the season\noff with a broken ankle so definitely\nhad quite the upswing towards the end of\nthe year here mhm yeah which is 100 like\nyou might not we might not I came into\nthe season not really targeting the\noverall um I had a couple Target races\nUnbound Crusher and big sugar but then\nyou know I had a really nasty injury\nafter a crash in the spring and that\nreally derailed all my plans\nreally 17 days Post stop and and it just\nknocked me on my ass way harder than I\nthought and I remember thinking two\nweeks ago I don't think I'm ever going\nto be the\nsame\nfeels early like I have concerns that\nthis is like maybe a little too\naggressive I want to be healthy for\nUnbound and so we're really pushing\nmyself to be able to do that push push\npush up finish the movement there\noh let's do some dubstep violin Dubstep\nviolin got it yeah Unbound was 12 weeks\nafter surgery and was able to really\ncome back and honestly surprised myself\nI had no idea that that comeback was\npossible well post angle surgery\nyesterday I'm super jazzed with where\nmyness is at and since then I have had\nan incredible second half of the year I\nbelieve you have to have a big fight in\nyou towards the end of the year if you\nwant to finish strong that's how one big\nsugar in 2022 and I'm feeling very\nsimilar the seasons have been kind of\nmimicking and I'm really gearing up to\nhave a strong\nfinish almost a halfway point 50 mil\ninto the race you're just chewing grit\nat this point just after a gnarly loose\ndescent is a tricky uphill bit of\nreprieve we are back on the road on\npavement mile 55 Mal Isa is pushing the\npace on this clown dropping Michaela\nThompson Sarah sterm just uh had a\nlittle bit of I she stopped on the side\nof the road right here let's stop stop\nstop stop stop stop stop he yep she's\ngot a puncture right now I think she was\nbasically I don't know if she was\nattacking off the front or if she knew\nshe was going to have had this flat and\nwas going for the fix got it fixed back\non her\nbike that was a quick tire fix for turn\nshe's head down almost back to the back\nof this\ngroup mile 36 the chase group of six has\ncaught the front group of six so we are\nback to 12 strong women at the front of\nthis race all the names that we probably\nwould have expected up here some that\naren't we don't have LDC up here she's\noff the bat loose gravel is not her Jam\ntoday so after 74 miles we have our lead\ngroup of three men headed into the\nWhistling Springs checkpoint Colby\nSimmons Simon senson and Alexi remain at\nthe head of Affairs and behind them that\nchase group remains largely intact with\nAlex how Borman Keegan Toby RH and\nBrendan Johnston all in there pacon and\nMatt beers are right there too so that\nwill be one to watch as they battle for\nthat second place spot in the Grand\nPrix let's send it out to Kimo and\nJanelle for the conclusion of the elite\nmen's big sugar gravel\nhere we are at the front of the men's\ngroup and uh Lexi the first Grand Prix\nRider to come through this aid\nstation uh you know he had a second\nplace last year in the overall Grand\nPrix second place the year before in the\nGrand Prix and just hasn't had a ton of\nthe results that we've seen from him in\nin years prior coming out of this aid\nstation is one of the steepest climbs of\nthe day so you can see them grinding\naway here trying to get up this\nhill got Matt beers in full Pace mode\nthis pace is just brutal climb is so\nsteep coming out of the\nfeed you can still see that it just\ncontinues I mean it hurts being out\nthere but if it's 100 miles it's 100\nmiles tell by Alexis style that this is\nhis moment he came through and over the\ntop of that climb took that left hand\nturn looked over his shoulder and he has\nmade a dent on the two riders that used\nto be his friends no matter what you\njust assume they're coming for you cuz\neveryone's racing to the Finish Line you\ncan see our Chase camera Riley Amos\nconnecting with Alexis's\nwheel p in M as we suspected pushing the\npace trying to keep maters off the back\nwe've dropped back to our first Chase\nthree have gotten away on that climb\nthey seem to be working really well\ntogether they know this is uh kind of\ncrucial that they get across this Gap\npretty quickly I think going into the\nrace obviously you want to fight for the\nwin but yeah it can become a points game\nthe lifetime game pre is an important\nseries so that's very much in the back\nof your mind this is a well-oiled\nmachine chasing down the three in front\ndoes is someone going to take a flyer is\nsomeone going to wait for the Sprint\nwhat are other people's tactics oh my\ngosh Matt beers beers bridged up he's\ngot Toby Reid on his wheel an incredible\nshowing as things play out in the final\n30 miles it comes a lot down to yourself\nI I have to do what uh what I feel like\nin the moment is right for me so as the\nlead group nears Bentonville it sounds\nlike Alexi and Colby were able to drop\nthe third Rider Simon senson has fallen\noff and now the two Riders remain out\nfront sometimes it works sometimes it's\nheartbreak but that's that's just SP\nracing Alexi and Kobe you know they both\ncome from a road racing background they\nboth really comfortable with putting in\nthe word coming into finish especially\nwhen you know there's a a steep con\nthat's probably going to be where the\ndecisive move will be made they're on\nlittle sugar Road they're about to cross\nthe highway which will take them to the\nfinal climb of the day it's just kind of\nhoping you have better legs than the\nother person like I have a good good\nfeel for that getting rid of some extra\nweight out of that bottle as they\napproach the final kicker before the\nFinish coming from the road I have a\nspecial place in my heart for dynamic\nRacing for hard races and I love the way\nthat kby came into gravel the end of the\nyear and to watch him make the race\nspecial and fun it just adds so much\ninto big sugar and here come our leaders\ninto that final climb towards the Finish\nAlexi veran has made the move he is UN\npinched kby Simmons as he just guts out\nevery inch of power power that he can in\nthose\npedals he has added to his advantage\nover Colby and I think it looks like\nhe's going to be able to hold this out\nto the Finish straight coming up to the\nfinishing shoot Alexi takes one last\nlook over his shoulder on what is a fine\nday for alexie ver muan this is your\nwinner welcome home your champion of big\nsugar gravel presented by m Alexi\nMo Alexi taking the win of the 2024\nlifetime Big Sugar classic presented by\nMazda I know the team and everybody's\ngoing to be just pumped with this win he\nreally worked for it HBY not giving up\ndoing everything he can this young Rider\nis certainly had an impressive\nperformance\ntoday so Colby Simmons ends up in second\nplace and in a battle for third Simon\nSpence and best Keegan Swinson and\nBrendan Johnson in a bunch Sprint to\nclaim a spot on the podium just behind\nthem Matt beers out Sprints Pac it for\nsixth\nplace so here's a look at the rest of\nthe men's big sugar final standings Alex\nhouse Toby Road and Lance hid it round\nout your top\n10 Colby freeburn is 11th Russell\nfinsterwald ends up in 12th Pete STNA\n13th and Alex wild takes the 14th\nspot now let's go back out into the\nfield one more time for the conclusion\nof the women's race Kimo and Janelle\ntake it\naway so Janelle as we're rolling into\nthis little field here before we get to\nthe Whistling Springs a station they\nwent through a timing mat uh looks like\nmile 74 there's 10 10 of them together\nas they head through Whistling Springs\nlet's take a look at the leaderboard\nPaige onweller is leading the pack\nfollowed by Melissa Aaron Flavia and\nMichaela Alexis scarda cesy Decker\nSophia Stella and LDC make up the top\n10 Sarah ster is 11th followed by Ma\nFarrell Jenna Whitney Allison and Emily\nNome rounding out\n15th let's toss it over to Janelle in\nWhistling Springs as the women make it\nthrough the second aid\nstation with our lead\nwomen they're going to hit this aid\nstation we saw the guys when they roll\nin there got a chance to pick up some\nfood and water but then there is a\nserious climb to get out of there and we\nsaw the race really get shook up on that\nclimb later in the the race is when you\nget to start looking at your matchbooks\nand deciding if you have more matches\nthan everybody else and how you get to\nuse them we're all strong in that group\nand we can't necessarily get away from\neach other someone's going to close it\nso I think the cohesion goes up as the\ngroup gets smaller as Sophia Gomez\nvishap makes contact as they come around\nthat turn so it's looking like paig\nanwell Elisa Rollins Alexa scarta Stella\nMichaela Thompson Sophia Gomez visha and\nyou know in a race like this Janelle he\njohnw we know that she can Sprint these\ngirls are probably thinking they want to\npry try to put a little Gap into her\nbefore they get down to that uh final\nfinish shoot Sophia Gomez Bishop has\nlocked up the series is doing what she\nsaid she was here to do which was come\nand win this race she is still in\ncontention Sophia can just hurt all the\ntime I mean that's the most impressive\nthing about Sophia is that even when\nshe's not feeling good she can hurt more\nthan everybody\nelse as Sophia tackles this hill here's\na look at her Garmin data to see just\nhow hard she's\npushing so impressive to push a\nsustained 350 plus Watts on one of the\nfinal climbs to the\nFinish mile 87 left hand turn Stella\nlooks like she's okay looks like her\nbike is okay and towards the end of the\nday we're at Mile 87 you never know\nright everybody's so tired and\nfatigued Aaron Huck has been dropped\nPaige onweller and Alexis scarta have\nbeen dropped at the front with Melissa\nRollins and I think that's going to be\ncesal\nDecker Melissa and uh cesal seem to be\ncontent to hang on to just sit on the\nwheel here and let let uh the overall\nleader of the series Sophia let her take\nthe pull and do the work to get them\naway from those that chasing group of\nthree we've been following along all day\non our garage a little bit a catch up\nhere things have continued to evolve at\nthe front your current series leader\nSophia Gomez V shaag leading the group\nthrough she now just has the company of\nM Lisa Rollins and cesal Decker I think\nI race best when I'm on the offense and\nwhen I'm feeling confident enough to be\non the offense is when things typically\ngo better for me as we look at our three\nleading women they still have about five\nmiles of racing one kicker and a gradual\nuphill finish ah this race right now any\nthree of these women could take it who\nwill make the pace up this climb it\nlooks to be cesal Decker taking to the\nfront dictating Pace Sophia out of the\nsaddle ready to respond to any sort of\nmove that is made here\nMelissa just took off Sophia's going\nwith her and they've dropped cesal\nDecker on this climb bar to bar these\nare the two women who are going to be\nduking it out over the top it looks like\nwe have actually some serious contact\nbetween these two Riders as they try to\nCrest this hill Sophia on the wheel as\nMelisa Rollins takes this short descent\nthis is the last bit of rest they're\ngoing to get\njust a little bit of a gap opening up\nthere Sophia was in that seated position\njust putting the pressure on Melisa out\nof the saddle looking for everything\nthat she could to just try to maintain\ncontact look at this I think Sophia has\nthe Gap that she needs one last look\nover the shoulder for\nSophia what a phenomenal ride by vag to\nget clear on the outskirts of\na big round of applause your silver\nmedalist this is M Lisa\nRollin Melissa Rollins coming across for\na solid second a strong race for cesal\nDecker third place today so Sophia holds\non to the top spot after the push by\nMelissa cesy holds on to third followed\nby Paige onweller and LDC moving up to\nfifth Aaron Huck came in sixth followed\nby Stella Hobbs Michaela Thompson Ferell\nand Jenna Reinhardt in 10th Alexis took\n11th followed by Flavia Sarah Sturm\nWhitney Allison and Emily Nome in the\n15th spot my big my Big Goal this season\nwas to win the first race of the season\nand win the last race of the season for\nthe past two years I tended to kind of\nfade and I don't know crumble at the end\nand big shter has kind of always picked\nmy butt and I'm\nexcited I really wanted to win the race\nbut straight points in the series really\ngood finish it's been a turbulent year\nuh a lot going on and I just wanted to\ngo out there and race uh didn't want to\nlook back all day and it's kind of what\nI\ndid I did it I did it time to go to a\nwedding right now now yeah you should\nclean up first I think going into the\nseason I wasn't really sure what to\nexpect in the in the series and after my\nresult at lville I knew what I was\ncapable of and I think I showed it here\ntoday yeah it was kind of poetic that it\ncame down to a Sprint between Matt and\nme and he was definitely the better\nRider today um so I have no regrets I\ngave it everything and yeah he's just a\nan incredible riter and it was so cool\nto do battle with him and everyone else\nall year I think for for us it's just\nfun to have our own race and today was a\ngreat example of that very Dynamic um\nsometimes you just got to be okay with\nhow it went\nthat's all all right one more round of\napplause you're overall with it ponum\nfor the lifetime Pig gravel presented by\nMa yeah I think it's been really cool to\nsee lifetime come in and com in hot and\nbig into the series you know I don't\nthink to have a to have a unified\ncalendar and to have all these races\nwhere you have the best Racers attending\nI think it's really\ncool ladies Gents it is time to get\nthese athletes on the stage let's give\nit up for our top 10 women in the\nlifetime Grand Prix if you're on that\nPodium it means something about your\nperformance it means something about the\nlevel that you've been able to maintain\nfor the year and that goes beyond that\ncheck we don't have to race against each\nother anymore let's just be friends we\ndon't have to talk about our training\nrides or what doing for the next race or\nanything your\n2024 overall lifetime Grand Prix\nChampion sopia\ngome it's been a great season and yeah\nI'm really happy with everything I've\ndone I present to you your 2024 overall\nChampion Mr Keegan\nsson there's a younger generation who\ncan look at this series and be like Oh\nokay that's like a real bike racing\ncalendar that I can like go and Chase I\nthink what we're doing what we're a part\nof is really special whether I race a\nbike for 3 years 5 years 10 years more\nbeing a part of this is the best part of\nmy career we're inspiring people to get\num out on bikes and that's the beauty of\ncycling it's a lifelong Sport and it's\nnot something that you do when you're in\nhigh school and maybe college and then\nyou're done you can do it from the time\nthat basically you can walk until like\nyou're 90 so here's your final lifetime\nGrand Prix leaderboard brought to you by\nsbl Keegan takes the top spot behind him\nMatt beers edging out pacing in today's\nrace moves him up into second place and\nPac takes\nthird for the women Sophia stays on top\nbut in second Melissa's effort out there\ntoday moved her up into that second\nplace spot Paige onweller takes third\nplace Alexis and Haley round out the top\ngent a round of applause for your 2024\nLifetime and great presented\nthe\nathlet 2024 has been a really I think\nPinnacle year for the lifetime Grand\nPrix we've looked back at the growth\nthat we've experienced over the last 3\nyears and we're really proud of how much\ngrowth that we've seen and how much\nrelevancy the lifetime Grand Prix has\ngained you know what I think we've\nlearned the most this year is uh just\nthe Imp act that it's having on the\nprofessional side of racing in our heart\nand soul we're a mass participation\nbusiness right and we're just trying to\nhelp people live happier healthier lives\nbut what's happening is we're seeing\nthat that professional athletes are able\nto make a living again and when we\nstarted this that was really the goal\nthese athletes are inspiring the next\ngeneration of cyclists to get on a bike\nand learn how to race and learn how to\nenjoy this sport going into 2025 it'll\nbe our fourth year of the lifetime Grand\nPrix you know what we vision is just to\nkeep getting bigger and better and we're\nactually making the series one event\nshorter but we're making a little bit\ntougher right we've added little sugar\nto the\nseries we have a more limited field\nwe're going to start with a smaller\nfield this next year and I think that'll\nmake it a little bit more\nexclusive and I think the importance of\nbeing able to compete and do well in the\nGrand Prix will just continue to get\nelevated for these athletes we're\ncreating opportunities and a safer place\nfor kids that we can Inspire to get into\nthe sport to uh chase that\nopportunity started too fast now you\ncan't slow down the runway girl in a\nhurricane t\nsinging a song that you never really\nknew and I need you to come back\nhome the sering drinks and New Orleans\nyou me a few friends and then you headed\neast to Seaside where the time flies and\neverybody seems to have the time of\ntheir life\nI you have\nbe don't forget where you came from\ndon't forget where you came from no\nmatter where you\ngo I'll be waiting right back home don't\nforget where you came from don't forget\nwhere you came from"

With massive thunderstorms, the race was shortened to 50 miles which made for an absolutely chaotic day. I had one of the hardest crashes of my life along with Hayden, but battled back to contest the field sprint taking 6th place! Hayden battled back as well to finish 5th in the U23 category and secure 3rd overall. He needed five stitches but no broken bones thankfully.\n\nOnboard footage is from @jgoettl2.0\u2019s GoPro, go check out his great channel!

      "transcript": "Yep, that's me. You're probably\nwondering how I ended up in this\nsituation.\n&gt;&gt; All right, where are we at?\n&gt;&gt; I don't need coffee to be awake.\n&gt;&gt; Big sugar time. Let's get it. So, we're\nhere at our Airbnb in Bentonville,\nArkansas. Technically, Bella Vista. We\ndid Little Sugar Mountain Bike last\nweekend. We have Big Sugar Gravel this\nweekend. These are the final two rounds\nof the Lifetime Grand Prix. They are\ndeciding the overall series standings.\nThere's a lot on the line. So, even\nthough I'm not in the series, I'm here\nto show what I can really do in this\ndeep end of the pool at the Premier, you\nknow, off-road series in the US. Um, so\nwe spent all week recovering from Little\nSugar. Now we're going to go out and\npre-ride, get everything dialed, get\nready for race day on Saturday.\n&gt;&gt; Coffee side service,\n&gt;&gt; table service.\nOr maybe it's\nbreakfast. Sausage, [laughter]\n&gt;&gt; eggs, fish, and grits and\n&gt;&gt; sausage\n&gt;&gt; inside\n&gt;&gt; going to pre-ride.\n&gt;&gt; No worries.\n&gt;&gt; Sorry, Kobe.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, sorry. Um, but\n&gt;&gt; well, we rode three minutes of gravel\nand got sick of it and found a pump\ntrack.\n&gt;&gt; Average gravel experience.\n&gt;&gt; We're so activated.\nMondreaker kinetic activated.\n&gt;&gt; Uh-oh. I can't shift.\nWe got the side by side simulator up\nthere giving us a little extra dirt. I\nthink this should be the skill filter.\nIf you can start\nit,\nyou can't do a 5second. Really? No\nstart. Great spot.\nLifetime protocol.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, kind of. [laughter]\n&gt;&gt; Ouch. Let go. [laughter]\n&gt;&gt; Let it go.\n&gt;&gt; Thursday, uh, October 16th,\nand I had some openers and we're going\nto go get activated. Well, I'm going to\ngo get activated. Join the Envy group\nride. Aiden's going to go home.\nWhat do you want to say to driver?\nWhat's going on, Ronnie Buns?\nExpo time done. Saw the kinetic folks,\nthe Envy folks joined in on the uh Envy\ngroup ride with Alexi and everybody\nelse. didn't miss it. And now we're\ngonna roll home. Put the legs up.\n&gt;&gt; You're working all right.\n&gt;&gt; Nice. Van looks Van's looking good. Good\nwork, honey buns.\n&gt;&gt; It's Friday. We got the lads behind us\ncuz he wandered off\ntime. We have our boy Weston getting\nsome some real footy back there.\n&gt;&gt; Whole squad getting activated in the\ncargo shorts.\n&gt;&gt; Caros.\n&gt;&gt; Mandreaker. No, no, not Mandreaker.\nKinetic. That one. Kinetic. A card\nsigning going down. Going down.\n&gt;&gt; We're getting her waxed up. I did not\nhook this up right, but we'll we'll get\nit out one way or another. I'm filming\nthis post race, but we're going to do a\nquick bike check. Everything's the same\nas how I ran it at Big Sugar, except for\nI ran road pedals instead of mountain\nbike pedals. 48 ring in the front, 1052\ntransmission in the rear for those big\nsteep climbs. NV 4.5s with 2.25\nThunderbirds that measure 56 mil. Other\nthan that, Mandreaker Arid frame, 39 cm\nEnvy Arrow bars. In hindsight, I think\nI'll run more like a 2.1 or a 50 mil\ntire for next year as this was a little\nmore than I needed for those road\nsections and is a little slow at times,\nbut other than that, super capable,\nsuper fast, still pretty error with the\nwheels and the bars. Giant gear ratios\nfor those steep climbs and those massive\nhard fast downhills and straightaways. I\nYeah, only thing I would change would be\nrunning a little bit smaller tire next\nyear. Um, I think that course is nowhere\nnear as gnarly as people made it out to\nbe. Same as the mountain bike race. Um,\nand yeah, the 56 mil tires were\noverkill. So, I'd go down to uh more\nlike a 50 for 2026.\n&gt;&gt; Locked and loaded.\n&gt;&gt; All right, Calvin, what time is it? What\nare we doing?\n&gt;&gt; Uh, it's 5:30 and we're getting ready to\nrace bikes.\n&gt;&gt; Heck yeah, probably. Aiden, what\ndistance are we racing bikes?\n&gt;&gt; It's a great question. [laughter]\nThere's some potential uh thunder Well,\nnot even potential. It's going to nuke\nrain and thunderstorm and maybe tornado.\nSo, they might shorten it to the 100\nmile course um or from the 100 mile\ncourse to the 50 milei course, but we\ndon't know what that when or what or why\nor how. So, we'll find out in a bit here\nstill.\n&gt;&gt; All right, guys. It's race morning.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Cheers.\nWe are rolling out and we cannot see a\nthing.\nWell, gentlemen, we are officially doing\nthe 50 mile course. We are going to roll\nwith the punches. We are ready for some\nhot nasty speed.\n[singing]\n&gt;&gt; Full cross start with the neutral.\nThree, TWO, ONE, AND THEY ARE OFF.\n&gt;&gt; It's the 2020 government.\n&gt;&gt; Incredibly impressed with how fast they\ngo out of the gate, even when it's 100\nmiles or going to the to the front of\nthis race and they're going to lay down\nthe gas right away. Such a different way\nto begin the race today because normally\nhe's\n&gt;&gt; All right, we're going to do something a\nlittle different here and do a voice\nover recap. Here's the roll out. It was\nquote neutral. Um, it's a little hard to\ntell on the video, but we were going 30\nm an hour. Um, [snorts] little bit\nsketchy, but I think the Lifetime crew\ndid the best they could with the giant\nswitch in schedule. everyone going from\nthe 100 mile to the 50 mile. All of a\nsudden they have pros doing the 50 mile\nroll out that was totally different. We\nhit the gravel about 20 minutes in or\nso. Um I think the breakaway basically\nwent off the front right there.\n&gt;&gt; Then here's our giant chase group. Three\nguys up the road. Riley, Matt Beers, and\nMatt Wilson from New Zealand. Now we're\ncoming into the feed zone at mile 30.\n&gt;&gt; You may know how that happened. Um,\nwe've got some onboard footage from Joe\nGottle. Uh, another Envy Rider. And then\nthese other screen caps are from the\nLifetime Grimpy recording. So, yeah,\nhere's the feed zone coming up to around\nthe next corner or two. Um, but all of a\nsudden, we picked up speed and I just\nwent down at 36 miles an hour. Um, yeah,\nhere I am getting back up. I asked\nHayden if he's all right. He says no.\nAnd I had to make the decision to either\nhelp him or roll. And I chose to roll.\nThere were other guys coming up to help\nlike that videographer. And there was\nnothing I could do for my boy\nunfortunately. I was pretty worried he\nhad broken his collar bone or his leg.\nSo I was kind of stressed about that\nwhile racing honestly. But yeah, then it\nwas just full chase mode. Caught up to\nthat next group again. Started working\nthrough guys. Um, yeah, cut my shoe in\nhalf, lost my garment. Um, was\nabsolutely shredded on the whole left\nside of my body. Thankfully, I kind of\nrolled as we all hit the ground, so I\ndidn't break my collar bone. I didn't,\nyou know,\n&gt;&gt; do anything longl lasting in terms of\ndamage. Just a bunch of road rash and a\npretty swollen knee.\n&gt;&gt; Um, then this is that last gravel\nsection into the pavement with about\nfour or five miles to go. We were\nraging. I thought we were racing for\n30th place. Um, and then all of a sudden\nright here, we see the chase group up\nthe road and we went from fighting for\nwhatever 25th, 30th to fighting for\nfifth place. We're back in it. Keegan,\nCam, all those guys right there. It\nstarted pouring rain. Uh, just\ntorrential downpour. This black wall of\na thunderstorm coming in at us. I mean,\nI had to take the glasses off. It was so\ndark. Finy launches a attack up the side\nof the road there. You know, we\nreconnected with that other chase group\nand he launched it as you do try and\ntake everybody surp by surprise. Lance\nwent up the road with him. Couple other\nguys tried some things. Luke Mostellar,\nI think, tried a little sneaker as well\nlater. Um, but then yeah, basically we\nare riding in towards the finish. Um,\ngetting towards the last climb. Here we\nare. We're up and over that last three\nminute puncher. I made the select group.\nI'm right here with the big dogs. You\nsee Keegan behind me there. Everybody\nelse, the GC guys are all watching each\nother just trying to beat each other to\nwin Lifetime Grand Prix overall. Here's\nthe very last shorter but hard kind of\nroller puncher up to basically a couple\nhundred yard straightaway before an\nS-curve into the finish. There's Kobe\nleading the charge, trying to help his\ntrack teammate and buddy Toby or\nTorbjorn Roads. Um, there I am launching\nup the left side, trying to improve my\npositioning. You can see Keegan on my\nwheel following me. There's an unnamed\nvideographer friend of ours getting some\nsolid footy. Um, you know, filming,\ndoing the watts [laughter] in the group\nor, you know, off the back of the group,\nnot in the way by any means. Um, yeah,\ncoverage was a little spotty here on the\nlive stream. It was storming so hard and\nraining so hard. Uh, here's on board\nfootage from Joe again.\nYou can see we're charging hard. We're\nabout to come into that right hand to\nthe left hand chicane before the\nfinishing straight. We're I mean we're\ncharging. Like it's always scary\ncornering on soaking wet asphalt like\nthis, especially when you're on big\nknobby gravel tires and not road tires.\nUm you just have less probably have less\nsurface contact. I dive bomb the inside\nthere on the left. I'm kind [snorts] of\nin the middle of the pack. Basically,\nall this was on instinct. I hardly\nremember what happened even and I don't\nthink that's related to me crashing\nhard, quite frankly. All of a sudden, I\nwas in the middle of that group,\nlaunching by one guy, then another guy\nin the slipstream there, coming in in\nsecond place for the field sprint behind\nCam. Um, yeah, I could hardly hardly\nbelieve it. It was like it was happening\nin slow motion and fast forward all at\nthe same time in that true instinct flow\nstate. Um, yeah, just hard to even\nbelieve that's what happened.\na lifetime Grand Prix season and uh what\na way to end it here with some weather\ncoming in.\n&gt;&gt; What a story having not started\nofficially in the Lifetime Grand Prix,\nbut\n&gt;&gt; oh man,\n&gt;&gt; so Caleb thinks he might have got fifth.\n&gt;&gt; Fifth or sixth. Kind of an important\ndistinction. Um couple guys up the road.\nUh huge group sprint. Cam\n&gt;&gt; Cam wound her up and won the group\nsprint. I came in right behind him. The\nmoral of the story is you absolutely\nsmashed it.\n&gt;&gt; I think so.\n&gt;&gt; And your lips are blue\n&gt;&gt; and I I was dropped lost my garment.\n&gt;&gt; I couldn't find it.\n&gt;&gt; Dirty. That's right. It's got my name on\nit.\n&gt;&gt; Check out the lips. They're definitely\nshould have brought your jacket.\n&gt;&gt; Oh no. [laughter]\n&gt;&gt; I literally\n&gt;&gt; Wait, your hand looks unwell.\n&gt;&gt; It feels unwell.\n&gt;&gt; My shoulder feels\n&gt;&gt; kind of tricky to sprint like that. Uh,\nwe did not.\n&gt;&gt; This should be illegal to be walking\nlike that.\n&gt;&gt; And then we went to Per where we cannot\nspend the bus.\n&gt;&gt; You good, man?\n&gt;&gt; Um, let me just give you a bus. Let me\nget\n&gt;&gt; and we'll on the way.\n&gt;&gt; Bend my leg.\n&gt;&gt; Wait, how am I going to do this?\n&gt;&gt; You want to sit in the front?\nChimchanga, fajitas, Sienna, Henry,\nCalvin, margaritas,\ninjuries,\nconcussions,\n&gt;&gt; just a wild card program.\n&gt;&gt; And he was [music]\nI know we're later when we need him.\n&gt;&gt; I love it.\n&gt;&gt; [music]\n&gt;&gt; Get my satisfaction.\n[music]\nWell, Jurro Eclipse did its job again.\nLittle bit of crack on the inside, but\nno cony.\nHayden's got five stitches.\nI can't bend my knee. But I'm just going\nto go put this in the garbage. I'm not\nflying this back to Montana.\n&gt;&gt; Well, we are loaded up.\nThat took a while. I'm very tired, very\nsore, but we got two bikes packed. We're\ngoing to the airport.\nCora, what do you think?\nGood grass.\nOh yeah, little red looking looking\nminty with the bike bags. Well,\neveryone, that's a wrap on Little and\nBig Sugar. I'm back here in Montana\nresting up. My knee bends now. I think\nwe're almost back to normal. As you\nprobably saw, it was so swollen I\ncouldn't bend it after the race and I\nhad to go uh party at the gravel rave\nwith one functional leg and could only\njump up and down on my right leg to the\nbeat of the music. A little bit of road\nrash, still healing up. I forgot my\ngloves in the jersey pocket of my long\nsleeve when I took it off. Otherwise, I\nalways try and raise gravel with gloves.\nBut yeah, to say the least, um, mission\naccomplished in Arkansas, 11th at Little\nSugar, sixth at Big Sugar. Um, probably\ntwo of the best rides of my life and my\ncareer. Quite honestly, I'm kind of\nblown away to have done what I went\nthere to do and proven that I can hold\nmy own against the best of the best in\nthis series. And yeah, I think next\nyear's probably going to look a little\ndifferent in terms of my race calendar.\nI'm excited to apply to Lifetime Grand\nPrix. We'll see if I get in and no\nmatter what. Um, yeah, I'm just grateful\nto my friends, my family, my sponsors,\neveryone in my corner, my coach Brian,\nyou know, Matis, you name it. My\ntraining partners, Porter, Elliot,\nHayden, Dex, all these guys and gals for\njust having my back and, you know, never\ngiving up on me and always pushing me\nforward. So, uh, yeah, I think we're\njust getting started here. Thanks for\nfollowing along. Thanks for watching."
