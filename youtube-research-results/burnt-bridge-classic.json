      "description": "This was my first race as a 60 year old! The Burnt Bridge Gravel Fondo is a low key, grassroots gravel race in the beautiful Cowichan Valley. In spite of the fact that it was still September, the weather was decidedly autumn like! Rather than ride the 77 kilometre medio event, we chose to ride the shorter 37 kilometre course. Check out this amazing event that suited for all ages!\n\nStrava link: https://www.strava.com/activities/9921176731",

      "transcript": "[Music]\num the guy that's doing the timing today\nPatrick he's a big guy with a beard his\nshop got these going during the pandemic\nthey were the only colors available and\nthen they realized oh my God this is\nawesome yeah everyone liked the ketchup\nand mustard\nhilarious okay how are you feeling this\nmorning Catherine fabulous what else is\nthere to say yeah so it's a um\ndecidedly\n[Applause]\nautumnishleaves years\nold I'm allowed to do\nthat uh we are one of the few gravel\nfondos uh that has five consecutive\nevents through Co some of you took part\nin the Belgian waffle ride uh that\nhappened earlier uh this year and uh\nwe're hoping to get some announcements\nmade for\nbwbc uh fairly soon there are certain\naspects of uh the course uh that you\nneed to be aware of\nthe 15K Mark you're going to go through\nan area that is actively being logged\nand there's two big signs that say stop\njust proceed through okay 15K you'll see\ntwo signs proceed through there's a\nbunch of equipment so these are the\nriders for the Behemoth the\n120 km event 3 2\nand they're\noff 120 km on a\ncold autumn day this event has a\nGrassroots lowkey kind of feel to it\nwhich is actually\nquite\nnice ready to go back of the pack okay\nas usual Catherine wants to start right\nat the back of the\npack get organized\nman\nand we're\noff rubber\nagain\nthis is my first\nrace as a\n60-year-old I think we'll be glad we've\nonly chosen to do the 37k route the\nweather is\nlooking\nquite ominous but this is a beautiful\ncourse this was actually part of the uh\ncouch and Crusher that we\ndid earlier this\nyear\nkeep it\ngoing I was a that was a steep little\nHill there to go\nC\nso right now this is a race to see if we\ncan beat the rain get to the finish\nbefore the rain\nstarts you\nare so we were told this morning during\nthe\nsafety briefing that there has been a\ncougar sighting out on this\ncourse which is not really\nsurprising given that the last time we\nwere here for the CCH and\nCrusher we ran\ninto uh Rangers who are out here with\ntheir dogs looking for a\ncougar\nStranges with no\nHearts stuck in our\ncloes so I can't tell whether I'm\noverdressed or not certainly didn't feel\noverdressed when we started it's still\npretty\ncool and the rain will be coming at any\ntime\nnow and slowly\ny yeah it has been quite a hilly\ncourse I wouldn't say we're back of the\npack we cast a few people on the\nclimbs and Catherine looks like she's\nclimbing quite well while things\nconsidered so we'll just keep going\nracing at\n60 I can still do it you can still do it\nI had sort of wished that more of this\ncourse was on the couch and Valley rail\ntrail\num these logging roads are great for\ngravel\nriding uh but that rail trail down in\nthe cowon valley is just\nspectacular have a good\none\namong\nlosers without\nshame how you\ndoing yeah and however soly\ntime the St are\ncoming Pur of the sun need to Golden One\nthe perfect golden\nthat's just a\nreminder that this is an active logging\narea the need\nto Hanging by\nstill hasn't started raining\nyet this is definitely being a hilly\ncourse we'll get a good workout even if\nwe're only doing the 37 km\nroute\nhey so we're just\naround 17 km in and we're about an hour\nand 7 Minutes in which is pretty good\nconsidering how much climbing we've done\nso we've got about another 20K to go and\nI'm hoping it'll be more downhill than\nuphill\noh my so\nmuch okay Catherine\ngo\nyou\nokay okay skull and crossbone\nsection\nmight make it up that other\nside well if there are any bears or\ncougars around here\n've just scared them\noff we've seen quite a few people with\nFlats\ntoday\n23 km in an hour and 29\nminutes\nit's getting a little cooler again I'm\nkind of glad we've got our rain\njackets are we stopping I need a bit\nsomething\nyeah we've only got 12 km want to\npush we are back on a gravel\nHighway\ncourse at this point I I'm feeling\npretty happy that we chose the the short\nroad we've worked\nhard we' probably worked a little harder\njust because we decided to do the short\ncourse and of course we want to beat\nthat\nrain\nthey were reminding US during\nthe writer's briefing that this is\nWilderness riding and you really do feel\nlike you're out in the middle of\nnowhere uh and given that it's a\nrelatively small race there aren't a lot\nof people\naround\nwow\nbeautiful\nNoy\ngirl\nokay so we are about\n34 km in an hour and 51\nso we might be done in under 2 hours\nwhich would be all\nright worked hard today happy\ncamper\nmy thought process my athletic app\nsays that I well exceeded my workout for\ntoday how are you feeling Catherine good\nit was a lot of uh climbing which I mean\nI knew cuz I looked at the course\nprofile\nyeah a lot of climbing did you enjoy the\ncourse I did yeah I'm I'm glad we didn't\ndo it longer honestly I it wouldn't have\nhad it in me today I actually um yeah I\nenjoyed it I pushed hard uh I find these\nevents always make me me pushed myself\nbeyond my limit so that was good still a\nchicken on the\ndownhill yeah I think I'm reasonably\nhappy today that we only did the\n35k not sure how excited I would have\nbeen doing the\n77 and as my watch told\nme I uh well went well beyond what\nathletic was GNA recommend for me to do\ntoday so can't base your event days on\nathletic athletic is just your\nday-to-day stuff races are always going\nto put you\nover anyway fun day and we didn't get\nrained on so that was wonderful yes that\nis\ntrue we did not get rained on which was\nvery\nimportant cuz I did not want to get\nrained on today and it sounds as though\nwe didn't come last I think we I think\nwe did all right today forgot to mention\nthat because we did the 35 the 35 or the\n37 kilm short race we didn't actually\nget to ride over the burnt\nbridge which of\ncourse is why the race is\ncalled the burnt bridge gravel Fondo\nstill a great event\nthough"
