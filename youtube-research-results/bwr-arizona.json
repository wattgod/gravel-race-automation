      "description": "This has to be one of the flowiest trails I've Mountain Biked in recent memory, it surprised me quite a bit. This trail splits off of Go John in Cave Creek Regional Park, and it is a worth while addition to the Go John loop. I took my Singlespeed Ragley Big Al out here to try some new to me stuff since it was so Snowy in Sedona this week.\n\nFollow me on Instagram @drewziraldo",

      "description": "Raw Highlights form the first race of the 2025 season at Belgian Waffle Ride Arizona. Unfortunately, this year's edition was a bit rough for me as I couldn't find the legs to get over the first climb. I kept fighting into McDowell, but my stomach also went south and I had to settle for survival mode. Still had a killer time of the trails and captures some awesome footage! \n\n\ud83d\udeb4\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Follow Joe:\n\u2022 Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/jgoettl2.0/?hl=en\n\u2022 Website: https://www.goettlmedia.com/\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 Ride Data:\nhttps://www.strava.com/activities/13762773019\n\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
