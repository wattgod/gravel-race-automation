      "description": "Taking a crack at the first edition of the Asheville Belgian Waffle Ride, the Hell of the North (Carolina). This is (after many course changes) a 98ish mile road and gravel course, roughly 60% road and 40% gravel. The road sections are still nothing to laugh at, with the final climb being a road section with some grades around 15-17%. Overall a fun weekend, hosted by Kanuga Bike Park and sponsored by Sierra Nevada Brewing.\n\nCheck out the ride on Strava: https://www.strava.com/activities/5830678641",

does that\ntitle's work in progress\nso i just finished setting up camp here\nwe're at the\nnorth mills river campground back in\nasheville for another one\nthis time we're doing the\nbelgian waffle ride asheville edition\nnot california san diego which is\nprobably the more popular one\nthis is the first year\nthat they're doing the asheville edition\nit was supposed to be last year but due\nto covid uh they had to kind of\ncancel that and then it was supposed to\nbe earlier this year and then they moved\nit to august so here we are i just\nfinished setting up camp\nas you can see\na nice little pad here\ngent\npop-up tent\nlet me tell you\nthat canopy is not easy to put up by\nyourself it's a\nbigger\ni think 12 by 12 footer\ni almost did a time lapse of me setting\nup camp but i'm glad i didn't because\ni'm pretty sure just the time lapse\nwould have taken up this whole video got\nthe bikes\ngravel bike for tomorrow\nand then i brought the mountain bike\njust in case i get a chance to do some\ntrail riding while i'm here since we are\nstaying\nthrough sunday\nanyway all right check in uh i think\nwe're going back to the expo belgium\nwaffle ride expo tonight so\ncheck that out they're supposed to have\na\ncrit\nand\nwhat's the other thing\noh some kind of vip meeting they're\ngoing to go over the course details\nthere's different segments that are\nthroughout the course and all that so\ntilled in\ngood morning everybody\nit is\n5 20.\ngetting\ncoffee situated we're doing the\nmedagliodoro\ninstant espresso\nget the uh\nokay let me\nsee jetboil\nrunning over here\nshould have some boiling water soon\ngonna get dressed and\ntry to get over there around\n6 30 or so\nso we're off to a good start\nwebsite said it starts at 7 30.\napparently it's at 7.\nand it is 6 59.\ni know\ni'm going the wrong way\nfrom\ngood job everybody smooth rolling out\nright on\ngood energy cool jerseys too guys\nnice work across the board\nall right just hit the first section of\ngravel\nso i'll see if i can actually catch up\nto my race\nthere's a reason people joke about me\nbeing late all the time\nall right\ni want to live on this gravel road\nthis is freaking sick\nlike\nall right just went through aid station\none\na little over an hour\nin and\nback up more road\noh this is\nand it's dark\nglad there's no potholes in there\nappreciate it you're welcome\ntwo\nstill feeling pretty good\n[Applause]\ngot some gravel here\ni think this is just a little lollipop\nand then eight station two becomes eight\nstation three\non the way back\njust went through 83\nso we're at a little over 40 miles in\ni had to uh\nshed a little bit of weight for the\nupcoming climb\nif you know what i mean i had to drop\nsome uh\nblue ridge pizza off at the florida\nnot papa john\nif you know what i mean my\npoo\nhour to weight ratio has increased\nif you know what i mean all right i'm\ndone\nwell you can tell we're in south\ncarolina\nthis road's worse than the gravel\nthis is very similar to\nsome of the ones we do in virginia\ncongratulations\nall right just went through aid\nfive i believe\nnow apparently this is going to be a\nripping\ngravel descent\nas long as it's downhill i'm happy\nbecause i am starting to hurt a little\nbit\njust went through the sixth and final\naid station\nso about\n15 or so miles left at this point\ngot some climbing to do still\nand my stomach does not feel good\nneither is anything else but\nthat's probably the worst part\ni don't know if you can tell\nhow steep this is on camera\nbut i'm standing\nin third gear\nand going\ntwo miles an hour\nif that\nwow\nthey really like to lay it on at the end\nah\ni finally made it to the top of that\nhopefully this is the last downhill\nand then the last little\nride back into the park\nit is now a few days later after the\nrace i'm back home no longer in\nasheville and just wanted to kind of\ngive a little recap on the race\nsince\nit basically started raining right after\nthat last clip\non the downhill and then the\nending of the race kind of snuck up on\nme\nkind of cutting in a back way and taking\nalmost like a trail through the woods\nand then\ncutting in and going through the\nbanner there at the end didn't get to\nfilm any of it and like i said it was\nraining so it would have been great\nanyway felt good after aid station six\nwas able to roll that last steep uphill\nthat i had on the video there it was uh\nthe strava segment said like 10 average\ngrade but i'm pretty sure some of those\npitches were\nupwards of 15 because\nlike i said i was standing in like first\nsecond third gear and just barely even\nable to move at all so it was\nit was pretty wild back of the pack\nchallenge\ni surprisingly\ndid not make it all the way back for the\nwin uh\nyou know\nian boswell was there so just\nhe kind of just uh\nattacked it on that last climb and that\nwas it so next race\nis two weeks shenandoah mountain 100\nkind of my a race most important race of\nthe year i've done that one the past\nfive years this is my sixth hundred mile\nmountain bike race\nso hopefully this will be kind of a last\nfinal big\ntraining ride for that and uh carry some\nfitness into that one and hoping to beat\nmy previous best time on that until next\ntime thanks for watching"

hundred miles you've ever\ndone\nyou're taking a lot of responsibility in\nowning and riding a bicycle for you are\nnow an operator of a wheeled vehicle\ni'm toasty\n[Music]\nuh\nyo\ntop of the uh it's not the morning top\nof the uh lunchtime to ya as you can see\ni got some gels laying on a suitcase\nwhich can only mean one thing we're\ngoing on a racing trip baby so this\nweekend me and my

all about so\nwe'll talk more about the route and all\nthat stuff later but we gotta drive uh\ntwo hours so we can get checked in and\ncheck out the expo and do all the things\nthat we need to do to get ready to start\nthe race tomorrow morning\nlet's get in that car let's drive there\nwe'll see you there you\nyes it is\nsierra nevada sponsored by\neven for the spectators my dad's\nfavorite

all checked in\neverything's ready to go\nyes sir\nso a little stats for the ride tomorrow\n98 miles they had to shorten it twice so\noriginally it was supposed to be 140\nmiles\nthey shortened that\nthen there was flooding this week\nbecause of rain\nso they shortened it again only like\nfour miles so now it's 98 miles and it's\nabout 10 000 feet again so we're gonna\nbe climbing a bunch and the best part of\nall that is i actually just got a new\ncassette on my bike\nbecause previously\nfor the race in west virginia i\ndefinitely didn't have enough gears i\nonly had 11 26 on the back so now i got\n11 36 so hopefully we'll have enough\ngears um but only one way to find out\nright so\n98 miles 10 000 feet\ngonna be awesome it's about 50 gravel 50\nroad so we got the 35s\nthe small boys\nso hopefully that'll be enough tire uh\nalways the question you know when you're\ngoing through a gravel race how much\ntire you need so we'll find out tomorrow\nbut i'm stoked\nlooking forward to a beautiful day out\nthere and just you know taking in all\nthe views and having a good old time\nhopefully we cross the line fingers\ncrossed\nknock on wood that would cross the line\nand get her

about to go down\nmy my feeling is that you know from mile\nfive to mile 95\npeople are going to be in the hurt\nlocker all day long and all almost all\nthe climbing is on gravel it's going to\nbe extremely difficult it's gonna be\ndemanding on your bike it's gonna be\ndemanding mentally because of how fast\nthe sections come in the race like you\ndon't get a 10 mile you know pavement a\nroll out or a 10 mile cruise into the\nfinish it's going to be\nit's going to be demanding from\nthe start to finish all day long\nhey\noh\n[Applause]\nyou're not seeing this\nokay\nwhat up my 40 checking\njust took a nice digger\num\ndon't really know\nhow it happened\ni was coming down the hill\ntook the turn\nand my tire just\ncame out from under me\nand i hit the deck\nlegs all screwed\nand the worst part is\ni was in such a good group\nwe were cruising\ni would say we're like\nthe third\nchase group maybe\noff the leaders\nit was a strong group\nand\nthere ain't no way i'm catching back on\ni'm toasting\nand i just crashed again\ni'm such an idiot\nall bro back on normal road\nlegs are cramping up pretty good\nbut yeah\nfalling twice\nobviously\ndidn't want to do that\nalso dropped my glasses\nright before i fell\nso\nwe've had a couple\nthings go on this race but that's okay\nas expected\nand now\nwe're just gonna pedal home\nand then\nall i can look forward to right now\nis an ice cold beer\nit's gonna be so good\noh baby\npeople see me talking to myself probably\nwhat the heck this guy does\nall right\nabout two hours left or so\n30 some odd miles\nlet's finish her up baby\nall right we're 10 miles out\n10 miles out from a beer\nand i just got flat\nalmost there\nuh so yeah\ngot flat\ndecided not to put a new tube in\nuh just\nhopefully it'll seal\nput some air in it so we're back up\nuh last hill\nand we got\ni don't know\nlike three miles\nafter this hill but this hill is a doozy\nof course\nso we'll see\ndonnelly also\nnow within a few meters of the finish\nline job well done out there guys\nfinishing here uh feels like riding\nacross wet carpet in the last uh\nall right we did it we crossed the\nfinish line\neven though i dropped my glasses crashed\ntwice\nmy helmet broke so i had to stop to fix\nthat and got a flat tire\nso it was you know\nit was a great time out there\nuh now we're going back\nto the vrbo not airbnb

One rider went off the front early and I burned a big match to stay in the chase group with some of the top gravel riders in the country (and Canada.) Stayed with them for the first 40 miles. I messed up and missed a feed which I was never able to recover from and unfortunately bonked hard with 5 miles to go where I lost the top spot in my age group. Still super pumped with the results even if I was dead at the end!\n\nThanks to Ben, Mike and BWR for the additional footage\n\nFAQ:\nBike: Trek Checkpoint SL Gen2\nFront Tire: Schwalbe Thunderburt 2.1 - 24 psi \nRear Tire: Specialized Pathfinder Pro 47 - 28psi\nCamera: GoPro 10\nEditing Software: Telemetry Overlay",

Unfortunately, this year's edition was a bit rough for me as I couldn't find the legs to get over the first climb. I kept fighting into McDowell, but my stomach also went south and I had to settle for survival mode.
