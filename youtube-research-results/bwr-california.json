      "description": "Belgian Waffle Ride is always an epic event. BWR has a new location this year which starts in Del Mar and featured a smaller but tight group of favorites from previous winners like Peter Stetina, Alexey Vermeulen and defending champ Matt Beers. This represents a new era in gravel cycling as riders are getting faster on and off the dirt and single track. Notable women include defending champ Sofia Gomez Villafane and Flavia Oliveira. It was an extremely fast race course that had the bicycle pushed to its limit. We always love covering our local bike race BWR. Did you do the event? How was your experience?

      "transcript": "[Music]\nThey're coming.\nWonderful, Matt. Wonderful.\nDamn.\n9 hours driving.\nWell, this is your whole\ntrip. Some of your\nfavorites. Yeah.\nUh today it's as good as it can get as\nfar as the conditions and the bikes and\nthe fun. I'm so happy to see the changes\nthat were made. You know, the series\nkeeps growing which is amazing. They\nhave a couple new races uh that I've\nnever done. So, I'm excited about that.\nThis is a brand new course to me. It's\nlooking pretty exciting. It's going to\nfavor the mountain bikers a little bit\neven though there's a fair amount of\nroad. I think the decisive parts of the\ncourse always lend it to those with more\nexperience in the off-road side of\nthings. But I think we're going to be\nhaving a pretty epic day out there as\nper usual and typical Belgian waffle\nfashion. I'm excited that there are so\nmany strong women lining up for this\nrace as well. I think that just elevates\nthis sport all together.\nWelcome to San Diego, California as we\nget ready and out for the 14th edition\nof Belgian Wubble Ride\nCalifornia. All the stars have arrived\nas we get ready for what's going to be a\ndynamic day of racing. This field is\nstacked. It is stacked for sure. Dave\nCole, what a great job on those\nintroductions. Ladies and gentlemen,\nwith just a few minutes to go, please\nrise if you can. Remove your caps.\n90 seconds, racers. 90 seconds to go\ntime.\nRacers, let's get\nready. We are counting\ndown.\nHeat.

About 20\nseconds. No lance. You look pretty, man.\nNo copes, Drew. I like it. No copes,\nman. You're looking good.\nAbout 40\nseconds. We got\nthis. About 1 minute. One minute behind\nMatt\nBeard.

Stay\naggressive.\nDamn, that's a big group.\nThere you go.\nOoh.\nRight,\nboys.\nHeat up\nhere.\nHe's clawing his way back\non. Dad's checking back. Matt look Matt\nlooks the freshest out of the three.\nPete knows what to do. He's latching on,\nnot giving up any daylight.\nPete is out of the saddle. Matt goes\nagain. He's making another dig. He\nresponds. Digging deep in the gap. He's\nchecking his\nsix gapped off by like Oh, this could be\nthe race right here.\nCome on. Come on, Alexi. Come on, Alexi.\nGo. Go now.\nOh, he's sitting\nup toast. He's sitting up for crab a\nlittle bit. Oh, he's super tucking.\nBig gap, though.\nAlexi can descend though. It's world\ntour.\nOkay, hang on. Michelle,\ndon't worry about me. I think you just\nturn\noff. This guy's\nwalking. Go. Got to go.\nGo Matt. Go Matt.\nPete. Come on, Alexi. Pete's right\nthere. Let's go.\nGo, go, go, Pete. Let's\ngo. It's all good. Let's go, Alexi.\nPete's right up there.\nJust force it. Right. You did it.\nYou did it. That does not count. But\ndon't take it.\nMan, you're 220 behind.\n40 seconds to pee.\nBack to back. Beat the new boss. It's\nthe same as the old boss. Here you have\nit.\nChampion South African\nMad.\nWow. Wow.\nYeah, man. Nice job, dude. Nice repeat.\nThat was incredible. Do you have a you\nhave the win to tell us how you attacked\non the downhill to make that happen?\nYeah. Uh, I saw Alex Lexi was looking a\nlittle fragile and um and then Pete was\nkind of giving it and yeah, I decided to\njust I could tell my I'm a big boy so I\ncan use my, you know, 80 kilos plus to\nreally move the momentum down the hill.\nAnd then I I think I corner a little bit\nbetter than those two guys. So I just\nthought, you know, free speed, free\ntime. Yeah, you had about a minute 40\ngap on the descent and then you just\nkept extending it at Hernandez hide h\nhighway when I saw you last. You had 4\nminutes on peak. Oh wow. I could have\ngone easier now. I know. Sorry, I should\nhave told you that. I thought it was 2\nminutes. I was just giving it like 460\nwatts into the head with this whole way.\nOh, you took it easy then. Yeah. Yeah.\nWell, congrats again. It was really\nwonderful to watch the whole day. Thank\nyou.\nComing in now. And here he is, your\nsilver medal winner. Pratty for the\nCliff family. That's Peter Staten.\nCongratulations, Peter. With some riders\nfinishing up,\nwhat do you say to the people at home?\nThey were rooting for you. I feel the\nlove whenever I come here. But, uh, I\nthink we all witnessed something special\ntoday. I mean, I can say I had a great\nday and some of the best legs I've had\nin a long time. And look good. Uh Matt\nBeers was the cat and I was his ball of\nyarn. I mean, I think uh all I can say\nis I'm I'm in awe and I think we've got\na a real champion for the future on our\nhands just because, you know, he was\ndoing a local mountain bike race uh a\nfew days ago and stoking kids out\ninstead of just being at home and\nresting his legs as the normal pro\nthing. So, uh man, I'm a I'm a fan and\nuh second to my true place today, so I'm\nI'm really glad to to end there. Yeah.\nCongrats. You look great out there.\nYeah. Yeah. That man's a beast. And on\nthis technical trail too has just he's\njust put minutes into into me on the\nYeah. You don't have that extra climb at\nthe end on this course. Bring back\ndouble peak for me and then maybe he'll\ncramp. It's all good, guys. Were you\nwaiting for Alexi? you kept at first.\nYeah. So, the split was down Highland\nand uh I Matt took a corner scary fast\nand there was a small gap and when you\nknow 190 lb guy or whatever gets that\ngap it just he was just tucking and I\ncouldn't close it. So, it was actually\nthat was the split of the race. Um and\nyou know initially not racing for second\nI just you know I kind of looked at\nAlexi like if it's just 111 the race is\nover. So, I kind of was like, \"So, get\nto me so we can go.\" But yeah, I thought\nAlexi was playing games at first, but I\nthink he's uh he was a little off. Yeah,\nhe was flashing.\nThe way back is tough.\nWere you trying to bridge to Pete? He\nkept on looking back at you at Highland.\nI mean, and it was like 5 seconds. Yes.\nNo. I mean, like I the whole day I felt\nnot great. um and kind of just trying to\nfake it until we got to a point that the\nrace would happen. And um yeah, I mean I\nI could have come back to him on the\nroad, but it wouldn't change anything,\nright?\nSometimes knowing that's better than\nanything else cuz you still got a lot of\nracing to go. That's true. That's true.\nGas to go with those guys up that climb.\nSo, I mean, I probably could have, but I\ndon't think I would have made it back.\nWell, you you hung tough and allowed to\nperform at the finish. I think it was\ngood to back off on Pomo climb for a\nsecond. Just for a sec. Yeah. I just\ndon't want to get anyone to hit you.\nWater will be right now. I can go get\nyou one.\nI wanted to have legs for the single\ntrack section coming back into town\nbefore coming back into town. Turn\naround where the group essentially blew\napart. Jonas and I fell off the back and\nMatt was at the front and just\nlike 500 watts going up that thing\ntrying to just hold on for dear life. We\ncame over the top probably 30 seconds\noff and then just worked together. We\nknew like there's a pretty big group\nbehind us. Wasn't sure on time, but we\nworked well together uh heading back to\nthe finish and then uh group caught us\nright at the tight switchbacks.\nYep. Caught us right there. Peter was\nleading that group just ripping. I'm\nlike, how is he? He reeled us in by the\ntop by the top of the switchbacks and\nthen us three hit the hikabike section,\nrode most of it, and then jumped off,\nran up it, and then it was just like\nwide open up those last three little\nkicks. Seven for seven large. This is\nnot the queen. This is the emperor, the\ngrand champion, the greatest of all\ntime. You're going to win by 30 minutes.\nThis is your champion, Sophia\nGomez. The living breathing queen of\nI was alone for a long, long time.\nJohn Borman came and like rolled me with\nZach and somebody and Coen and I just\ngot gapped and then I caught on the\nsingle track and then the guy I was\nwith. We did the first climb and then I\nhad to stop to check something and he\ndrops me speed and then I was basically\nsolo up until Ramona on the way back and\nthen yeah had a nice little group of\nchildren. How was it overall?\nIt was good. I mean the time isn't long.\nI like it but\nI'm also\nnot any issues out there.\nYeah, it was fit. Yeah, I won. That's\nall that matters. I think last year\nthe field might have been a little bit\ndeeper and there was girls that had like\nthis year to see Whitney and um Courtney\ncrash out was like super super fun to\nhear. Um so that's just never any fun.\nhave, but it's a savage course and you\ngot to keep your tires on the ground.\nOolivera, second place at BWR. Are you\nhappy with second or disappointed? Oh,\nyou know, it's a mixed bag. You know,\nobviously I'd love to win this race, but\nI know I had tough competition out there\nand getting second to Sophia is, you\nknow, also something to be proud of. The\nrace is pretty hectic from the\nbeginning. Yeah, it was I I just wanted\nto stay safe in that first part. It was\npretty chaotic in the beginning. Also,\nmy knees. It's steep.\nI didn't realize how steep it was going\nto be. Even with a mountain bike shoe,\nthere was no traction.\nToo bad. Nice. Yeah, it was awesome. The\ncourse is great. I love it. It was fun.\nYeah. Windy. Very windy. Were you by\nyourself a lot? Uh, in the beginning a\nlittle bit. I just I was just too scared\nto be fighting for position in that\nfirst part of the not the road, but once\nwe got into the trail, uh it was\nimmediately mayhem. Bodies and bikes\ngoing every each direction. I was like,\nthere were a couple crashes. I'm sure\nyou guys know. Winnie is in in urgent\ncare right now. I hope she is going to\ngo get her. Yeah, this is never\nsomething you want to see. That's what\nI'm saying. So, you got third today at\nPWR. Are you happy with third or a\nlittle disappointed that you didn't get\nbetter? What's going through your mind?\nYeah, great question. A little bit of\nboth. It was my first time ever riding\n100 miles in general. So, I really\ndidn't have any sort of expectation\ngoing into the race. Um, I definitely\nwanted to be closer to Flavia. I really\ndon't know what the gap was there. and\nyou know Sophia is in a league of her\nown but uh it was really just\nexperiential so I'm really not\ndisappointed at all. What was your most\nmemorable part of the course today?\nUm probably the end. So that part was\nextremely extremely tough with the\nzigzags and then going into some\nextremely steep sandy downhills and then\nsome 30% uphills. I did walk my bike at\nthe very end, so it was soul crushing uh\nfinish. So, I think that was my favorite\npart. Nice. Well, congrats on third\nright there. Our top five elite wrestle\nwinner here at the 13th annual VW\nCalifornia. Congratulations. There you\ngo, ladies and gentlemen. your top five\noverall here in the 2025 Waffle Elite\nmen's category at BWR California.\nCongrats.\nOkay, so we are back at the Velworthy\nhouse. Uh our house guest Whitney\ncrashed out and she is out of\ncommission. Zach is here taking care of\nher. We're all taking care of her. But\nthe race is over and man does it feel\ngood to be back out on the course, out\ntalking with the athletes, seeing things\nunfold, giving words of encouragement.\nAnd so I really hope you like this\nvideo. Um, and I'm just can't wait to\nget back in the in the mix of things.\nIt's, you know, hard being uh with\nthings going on in my personal life just\nunraveling to have cycling as something\nthat is sort of my constant, my safety.\nSo, um, hope you like the video. Another\nBWR is in the books. Uh, can't wait for\nthe next event. So until next time, this\nis Brian saying stayworthy."

      "transcript": "3.\nWelcome back to the Drew Dilman YouTube\nchannel. We are at\nBWR California. The big news with this\nrace this year is that there is a\nmassive course change with the change in\nvenue. We are no longer climbing double\npeak. Woo! Which is good because as you\nmight know historically this race has\nfinished up a massive climb with the\nsteepest pitch being right at the end of\nthe race up a road called Double Peak.\nIt was brutal. But this year that is not\nhow the race ends. Instead there's more\ngravel.\nNow that you know double peak doesn't\nhappen at the end of this race, it\ncompletely changes the dynamic of the\nrace because now you know I don't have\nto save so many matches for the end of\nthe race. You can be a little bit more\nrisky with your efforts earlier in the\nrace. Here goes Floyd Landis on the\nattack.\nJohn Borselman attacks with about one\nmile before the first off-road sector.\nAnd this is a strategy that he's used\nbefore to get a buffer before the\ntechnical parts of the course to give\nhimself a little bit of a head start. I\ninitially go with him, but I reacted a\nlittle too late and a little too soft. I\nwasn't fully committed to jumping across\nto his attack. So, I drift back and I\nend up back in the group. And in\nhindsight, I wish that I had committed a\nlittle bit more because I think it would\nhave saved me energy in the long run\ninstead of trying to play catchup after\nnot getting a great position into that\nfirst off-road sector. And it could have\nactually worked to my advantage cuz had\nI entered the dirt sector with\nBoristolman and then dropped Borstman,\nhe'd pretty much clog up the trail for\nme, helping me to open up a gap and at\nleast not have to surge so hard and a\nlittle and go a little bit more my own\npace during that first off-road sector.\nOh, but instead I don't enter that first\noff-road sector with that good of\nposition and end up having to chase to\ncatch back up to the leaders for over 20\n[Music]\nminutes. Floyd Landis is caught.\nThe course this year also included quite\na bit more rough off-road sections,\nwhich meant more people considered it a\ngravel race instead of a road race with\noff-road sectors, which is usually how\nit's been treated in years past. The\nmost obvious display of this was in tire\nchoice. In years past, most riders opted\nfor a wider road tire like the Strata\nBianca 36s I ran last year. However,\nthis year, most riders were on 40s or\n45s and opted for a more gravel specific\ntire. This year I went with the\nPathfinder\n40s. And right on Q, John Borslamman is\non the side of the trail with either a\ncrash or mechanical or flat or\nsomething. He he ends up dnfing, but\nthis is becoming a recurring theme in\nall of my videos. And John, if you're\nwatching this, I know some really good\nmountain bike specific coaches at\nIgnition Coach Co. that could help you\nimprove your handling skills. And heck,\nI'll even give you $100 off your first\nmonth. And with the double dizzle\nkibbits, number 20, don't ignore your\nweaknesses. And number 11, hire an\nignition\ncoach. And sure enough, there's a gap to\nthe front group. And I've done this race\nenough and I've missed the front group\nenough in this race that I am not\ncontent to just sit here and watch them\nright away. So I light it up on this\nsteep uphill section right before a\nreally big downhill in hopes of bridging\nup to those leaders before the next\npaved section.\nOh. Oh.\nI link up with a few other riders and we\nare dedicated to the chase. Now this\ntakes about 26 minutes with a normalized\npower of 335 watts or.92 intensity\nfactor and an average heart rate of 185.\nThis was not an easy bridge, but we are\nsuccessful and we catch those leaders\nright as we're entering in the next dirt\nsector, Lemon Twistenberg. And like a\ndoofus, I go into that section in dead\nlast.\nOh.\nIn this really long dirt section, this\nlead group gets blown to shreds And I\nfind myself chasing with Russell Finster\nWald with about six or seven riders up\nthe road. And we do end up making the\ncatch before the next paved section.\n[Applause]\nAnd for a few moments there, it was\npretty cool to be riding in this front\ngroup, having looked around and seen\nFour previous winners, Matt Beers, Alexi\nVermuan, Russell Finsterwald, and Pete\nStaten. But soon after we catch this\nlead group, we hit the biggest climb on\ncourse, which is a fivemile paved climb.\nAnd basically at the bottom of that\nclimb, I end up gapped off of the\nleaders, but I keep them just in sight\nfor the first half of the climb, but\nthen not being able to bridge that gap,\nend up deciding to go my own pace,\ntrying to avoid a full detonation.\nFamily\npodcast, man.\nAnd to give you an idea of how hard this\nclimb was, it took about 22 minutes with\na normalized power of 347 watts, which\nis 96 intensity factor given my FTP. My\naverage heart rate is 188 and it tops\nout at 196. This is the highest heart\nrate I've seen in a long time. Diesel\nkibbit number 19. Pacing is dead.\nDaxton and Finy end up catching me and\nwe end up working quite well together\nfor the next long while.\nAbout halfway through the race, we end\nup catching the best looking guy in\ngravel, Lance Hayd. When I ask him how\nhe's doing, he gives me a haggarded look\nand says, \"Dude, I'm dying.\" But then he\nproceeds to smash the next climb and I\nfind myself dangling on the back of this\ngroup, barely hanging on, hoping that I\ncan stay with this group of four and\nsolidify a top 10.\nAnd all I can think when I'm in this\ngroup with Lance Hayden, Russell\nFinsterwald, and Dax Mock is that there\nis absolutely no way that their heart\nrate is as high as mine or that their\neffort level is as high as mine. And\nthis is just the reality of racing with\npeople who are more talented than you\nare. You're going to have to put out a\nbigger effort to go the same speed. And\nI feel confident saying that because\nLance, Daxton, and Russell all have big\nresults to back up their race history,\nwhereas I just have a long list of\nmediocre\nresults. With only five guys up the\nroad, it seemed it might be possible\nthat we could be racing for a top five\npodium position if one or two of those\nriders from the lead group completely\nblew up and we caught them. But those\nhopes are diminished when a big group of\n10 riders end up catching us on the next\npave section with the likes of Petervak,\nJulian Gier, and Griffin Easter. Now, me\nand Julian were actually sharing a\nbedroom at our host house. And so, the\nbattle for bedroom bragging rights is\nnow fully on.\nDaxton Mock, who during this race told\nme that he was a handling wizard, nearly\nslides out on this paved descent. It was\nkind of scary.\nWe turn onto this dirt road and about a\nmile after that, we're going to enter\ninto a narrow single track section. Now,\nit is crucial for me to be at the front\nof the group going into that trail\nsection because with a group this big,\nthis late in the race, gaps are\ncertainly going to open. And if I want\nto finish near the front of this group,\nI have to position well because we are\nstill racing for sixth\nplace.\nHeat. Heat.\nI'm about midpack and my three\ncompatriots who I had spent most of the\nrace with, Daxton, Lance, and Russell\nare the top three riders and I was\nwishing that I was up there with them,\nbut I do manage to stay with the leaders\nthrough this trail section. However, I\nam starting to feel quite fatigued and\nthe pain is starting to settle in.\nAnd it's not long after that that I end\nup gapped off the back of this group.\nFizzle kibbits number six. Eat more\ncarbs.\nAt this point in the race, I was a\nlittle bit behind my nutrition plan or\nthe carb intake that I had set out for\nmyself. And I knew that this had\nsomething to do with the reason I was\nhitting the wall. It also doesn't help\nthat I had spent the first 3 hours of\nthis race, well over my pacing strategy\nfor a race this long with heart rates in\nthe 180s and 190s, way more than I would\nhave liked. Here's a chart to give you a\nvisual of my power and heart rate\nthroughout each hour of this race. The\nblue bars are showing you my intensity\nfactor with the power above that. And\nthen the red bars are showing you my\naverage heart rate per hour. The main\nthing that I want to point out is how\nhard I went early in this race. From the\ntime we hit the first dirt section until\nwe were caught by that big group of 10\nriders, I was riding well over the pace\nthat I should have been with a\nnormalized power of 317\nor87 intensity factor for nearly 3\nhours. My average heart rate during this\ntime was 182 with a max of 196. It's\nsafe to say I had burnt some matches.\nAnd I'm not just telling you all this to\nmake excuses. I'm telling you this to\ngive you the facts. And the fact is is I\nneed a little bit more durability and a\nlittle bit more fitness so that I can go\nthis hard early in the race and not be\nriding at such a high intensity factor\nand burning so much energy in the first\nhalf of the race so that I have some\nenergy left in the tank for the end of\nthe race. Heat.\nHeat. Heat. Heat.\nOne of the new parts of the course\nincluded these really sharp uphill\nswitchbacks. And the only way that you\ncould really ride these switchbacks was\nto stick out your hand, grab the post,\nand whip around that thing full cycle\ncross mode. And there were a lot of\nthem.\nNear the end of the last dirt section,\nonly about 7 mi from the finish, there\nwas an optional route. You could opt to\ngo further, stay on your bike, and ride\nthrough a creek. Or you could opt to\nturn and go up this really steep hill\nthat forced you to dismount your bike\nand run. I opted for the runup, knowing\nthat it was about a minute faster than\nthe creek crossing. And I went full\ncyclacross mode once again, shouldering\nthe bike all the way up the hill. The\nspectators at the top even told me that\nI was the fastest guy they had seen go\nup that runup section all day. So, while\nI may not have won the race, I won the\nrunup. I'll take it. By taking the\nrunup, I actually end up passing this\nBear Devo kid, Luke from Georgia, who\nopted for the creek crossing. So, I pass\nhim. He ends up catching me, tries to\nblow past me. It doesn't work. I get on\nhis wheel and we're pretty much dead set\non soft pedaling all the way to the\nfinish where we're going to sprint it\nout. Diesel kibbitz number four, always\nsprint. This is a race. We're not here\nto hold hands across the line. We're\nhere to get the best place possible. So,\nthis kid knows I'm gonna sprint him and\nI know he's gonna sprint me because we\nlike to race our bikes. The last turn is\npretty sketchy. It's on gravel and it's\npretty high speed. And Luke makes a\nreally fast last second pass going into\nthat turn. And I'm hoping he's going to\nslide out, but he doesn't. And because\nthe sprint to the line is so short,\nthere's no chance I'm coming around him.\nand he beats me. Well played, young pad\none. I finish in a time of 5 hours and\n15 minutes with a normalized power of\n292, which is8 intensity factor. Average\nheart rate\n176, TSS 341, 4,700 kJ burned. All of\nthis is good enough for 13th place\noverall. Next up, I've got a massive\ntraining block to prepare for the\nUnbound 200. # overtrain or bust. That's\nall I got for this video. See you in the\nnext one."

About half the route was new, while the other half, for those that did the Wafer and the Waffle, was pretty much the same as last year once we got up to Lake Hodge. But, overall it was, as always, a great event worthy of being called one the best North American Gravel Race. \n\nOh, also, congrats to both Matt Beers and Sofia Gomez Villafane for their absolute monster of a win 2 years in a row!!

      "description": "This is the 2022 BWR Wafer and the BWR Wanna in San Marcos, CA, from the perspective of average cyclists. Come experience the more attainable versions of the Belgian Waffle Ride from me while doing the BWR Wafer and from my dad while doing the the BWR Wanna. \n\nThis is the perfect race for us to do together as it meets in the middle of our cycling interests and desire to cover miles. I generally prefer all terrain bicycle touring, and my dad generally prefers cross country mountain biking. \n\nOther than that, all you really need to know about the BWR is that instead of medals, finishers receive a celebratory bottle of beer. Oh, and who could forget the pre-race waffles and the post-race waffles with ice cream.\n\nWe're not sponsored, but we both really liked our bicycle setups, which were as follows:\n\nMe: \n- Sonder Camino gravel bike (https://us.alpkit.com/collections/sonder-camino?storeRedirect=US) with the low end Shimano GRX group set (https://bike.shimano.com/en-EU/product/component/grx-10-speed.html)\n-  Teravail Washburn 700 x 38 gravel-specific tires (https://teravail.com/products/washburn-tire?variant=39350969499699)\n- Road Runner Bags Jammer Handlebar Bag (https://roadrunnerbags.us/products/the-jammer-bag)\n\nMy dad:\n- Specialized Diverge Comp gravel bike (https://www.specialized.com/us/en/diverge-comp-e5/p/199975?color=322132-199975)\n- Specialized Pathfinder Pro 700 x 38 gravel-specific tires (https://www.specialized.com/us/en/pathfinder-pro-2bliss-ready/p/157870?color=237517-157870&searchText=00019-4412&gclid=Cj0KCQjw-JyUBhCuARIsANUqQ_LyEl2VbNqdxwA5W_cBCQW2IIaaFJPUiSkaK055wDXOtzW3_Opw1AgaAr5PEALw_wcB)\n- Road Runner Bags California Burrito Handlebar Bag (https://roadrunnerbags.us/products/california-burrito-handlebar-bag)\n\nThis video was filmed on a GoPro Hero 10 (https://gopro.com/en/us/shop/cameras/hero10-black/CHDHX-101-master.html?gclid=Cj0KCQjw-JyUBhCuARIsANUqQ_LMvl54Yh0oDH98xJAuVxjrNKZdQ2vAM8Wgi-6KjeXXuxoCRK7Wk1waAsXvEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds&option-id=CHDHX-101-master) and my dad's cell phone (I think a Moto G8 or something)\n\nAll music and sound effects are from Epidemic Sound, which has an amazing selection.

      "transcript": "the inaugural bwr Arizona was a raucous\nRowdy Affair I had the chance to test an\nArizona gravel bike here in the desert\nthe pivot Vault the notable feature of\ncourse being the isoflex it looks like a\ndropper post it's not although you can\nrun a dropper post it is an elastomer\nencased post that takes a bit of the\nedge off\nthese rough roads that the mischievous\nmind of Michael Marts put us on for the\ninaugural bwr Arizona I want to tell you\nabout this bike I want to tell you about\nthe opportunity I had to go and visit\npivots which is just down the road run\nby Kris kokalis a man who's been\ndesigning Engineering Building bikes for\ndecades and doing a great job of it and\nI want to tell you about the days that\nlent up to this including myself and my\nfast cat coaching boss Frank Overton\nleading the ShakeOut ride but first I\ngotta go check out of my hotel I've got\na noon checkout we've got a few minutes\nhere so I'm gonna go clean myself up you\ntake a second hit that subscriber button\nwe'll meet back here and we'll talk\ngravel bikes and vwr Arizona\n[Music]\n[Applause]\nand we're back got freshened up got the\nfinishers trophy pwr does the trophies\nright like the race course a little on\nthe\nstiff side this bad boy is 8.5 percent\nso we are here in the wash which is the\nfinal kick in the teeth for the wafer in\nthe wash the wafer and the waffle can't\neven speak straight at this point\nyou know you've Belgian waffled when\nyou're not speaking straight at the end\nof the event so just when you are\nmeters from the Finish\nyou're diverted into this deep sand wash\nit's only a couple hundred meters but if\nyou're already wearing the the poopy\npants feeling grumpy about things this\nisn't going to help we've seen a few\npeople tip over as they run out of steam\nor cramp or all the above Keegan Swenson\nand his partner Sophia Gomez viafone\ntook the respective wins Christopher\nBlevins World short track Champion came\nin just ahead of Keegan into the wash\nKeegan came around to take the w\nI just couldn't put power down yeah\nthat's where you know Grandma racing is\nso interesting like I think you know\nKetone was driving really well\nI think I was riding it really well and\nhe had a little wider tires maybe a\nlittle lower pressure yeah I think that\nmade the difference now\njust a matter of feet after 100 yeah\nI'll just feel out there keeping nice\nworking dressing the wind thank you that\nwas a good one uh yeah great Chris and I\nhad a pretty epic uh last 10 miles\nI'm pretty much attacking everyone over\nthose climbs that last neighborhood and\num yeah probably had me a few times and\nyou slowly brought him back and bought a\ncat Mouse but awesome day so let's talk\nabout the the course a bit and we'll\ntalk about the bike and then talk about\npivot itself but I want to ride the\noriginal of course is in San Diego that\none draws 4 000 plus Riders Michael\nmarks the Mystic manic Mastermind behind\nthis Mayhem describes his races now as\nunroad not gravel but unroad and I gotta\nsay that they are not like your typical\ngravel race if there is such a thing as\na typical gravel race in that\na steamboat or an Unbound the surface is\nfairly consistent throughout here you're\neither on baby butt smooth pavement\nflying along in a big group or you're on\nchunky\nmud Laden whoops the likes of which we\nsaw numerous Motocross Riders out there\nwriting because that is their Terrain\nso what bicycle do you pick for such an\nadventure most you know the entire\nquestion is always a big thing I saw\nKeegan was on slicks a couple days ago\nthat bold choice but if anybody can pull\nit off he can I asked him about that at\nthe Finish here's what he had to say\nI thought you had I thought you had\nslicks on earlier changer\nyeah so I did the wafer today the 80\nmile venue which was Good and Plenty you\nknow we got to tackle a lot of The Hairy\nBits and one thing I love about gravel\nis you can get anywhere you fit in right\nyou can pick whatever distance you like\nit's not like the fast kids get to do\nthe long one and then it goes down from\nthere if you want to go big you can go\nbig if you want to do the 35 mile wanna\nhave at it and often the courses will\noverlap so you're riding together so at\na few points a day it was mixed in with\nwaffle Riders it was good to catch up\nwith folks and share pulls as we rotate\nit through\nso is this gnarly mix of stuff fun or\nnot the answer is yes depends on who you\nask he was talking to a few writers in\nthe hotel who said they were scared at\npoints and I too certainly felt this way\nespecially on the first dirt descent I\nwas wishing I had seen that ahead of\ntime yeah go\nspeaking of a couple days ago we did the\nfast cat ShakeOut ride I worked\npart-time at fast cat for my buddy Frank\nOverton and we led a fast cat ShakeOut\nride on Saturday day before the event\nwhere we took in part of the course you\nknow the pros often will get out and\nScout almost all the sections at least\nthe the technical bits and for good\nreason like when you're coming in hot\nbehind a bunch of people dust is being\nkicked up it's better if you've seen it\nbefore that's certainly not realistic\nfor many of us but we try to get out and\nsee at least part of it the day before\nis a good way to open up the legs too so\ncertainly enjoyed doing that with the\nfast cat gang okay let's talk bike pivot\nVault this first came out in 2019 I want\nto say two weeks in 2020 the isoflex is\nthe story here there's certainly a lot\nof geometry bits we'll get into that but\nthe isoflex basically means you've got\nsome give in the seat post I was talking\nto a writer Jim schiel from Colorado\nwho's got the new specialized Str\nsuspended Rider s works by bike and I\nwas telling Jim that this feels similar\nto the that Str in the middle setting\nthere's three different settings on that\nfour centimeter gravel bike and this\nfeels\nlike the middle setting maybe between\nthe first and and second sitting and\nthat it takes the edge off it's not like\nbobbing and weaving all over the place\nand I didn't feel much lateral movement\nbut certainly uh it was was a welcome to\nhave a bit of comfort also you can put a\ndropper post on here and doing the\nShakeOut ride I absolutely would have\nused a dropper post somebody send a\ndropper stats oh\nthere's parts that were so steep I was\nyou know all the way back stomach on the\nsaddle rear wheel locked up front wheel\nabout to lock up and would certainly\nhave appreciated it having a dropper and\nyou know often my take on Dropout post\nis that yeah they work well in those\nsituations but then they compromise the\nfeel of the bike right like often just\nhaving a longer than this 27 2 carbon\npost for me is a good amount of flex\nsomething like the vcls post that comes\non many of the canyon bikes that's got a\nnice amount of give and if you put\na dropper on there that is a rigid thing\nso you're kind of sacrificing the feel\nso here with this pivot Vault you can\nhave your cake and eat it too in terms\nof Geo\nthe I'm on a size large here which has\ngot a basically like a 57 top tube uh\nnot super long I spoke to Chris cocalis\nabout that and he was saying like a\nlittle Progressive is fine but too much\nis too too much you know good middle of\nthe road bicycle Politics the the front\nend is a 72 that's certainly on the on\nthe steeper end for gravel bikes I\ndidn't feel like it was overly squirrely\nbut then again I tend towards a racier\nlike a road racer feeling gravel bike so\nI liked how that felt bike also has\ndurase durachi 12 speed\nI'd love to feel this especially in the\nhand you know the bit of how it curves\ninwards I love how the buttons Drive\nmy Garmin drive you can change Pages\nwhile keeping your arms and hands inside\nthe ride which is a good thing to do in\ngravel and toggle between the map page\nand whatever other data dirkery Pages\nyou want to look at\num\nI love it to buy and better believe I\nwas in all the gears at some point you\nknow climbing up some of the Steeps and\nthe smallest gear and then also you know\nusing the 50 against the 5034 using the\n50 11 at many points on the road at some\npoint I did get chainsaw going like one\nof the mini sharp down sharp up\ntransitions went Big Ring small ring and\nthe chain got sucked up in in between\nthe ring and the chains they had to\nclimb off and pulled the chain out\napologies to the Riders I jammed up\nbehind me\nit was cool I've never ridden a high-end\ngravel bike with durase 12 speed I guess\nI love everything about it certainly the\nfeel up here the Shifting the gear\noptions what I would have preferred it\ndoesn't exist yet but is a clutch\nrear derailleur a la grx so\ngrx is 11 speed\nwe may see grx 12 speed down the line\nwho knows what's in the future there I\nlike this the narrower Q factor of the\nrode cranks compared to a slightly wider\nuh stance of grx\nOutback we've got 420 change days which\nare pretty short both the drive side and\nthe non-drive are dropped we often see a\nlower Drive side chain stay\nseldom sea the non-drive dropped the\nidea is to get a relatively tidy 420\nchain stay and still have clearance for\na 45 mil tire and clearance for crank\nmounted power meters like stages or four\neyes\nspeaking of I if I had known the bike\nwas going to have a durase Craig on it I\nwould have brought a stages meter\nbrought the the SRM X power pedals just\nbecause I'm a dork and I like to have\npower because if you don't have data how\nwe do know if whether you're having fun\nor not so I like having power on bikes\nthat's why I brought these but\nthey're fussy man they're super fussy\nfrom you know trying to charge the\npedals\nI was unable to do that in hotel room\nafter doing one ride and they got a\nlittle dirty so I got a little Clorox\nwipe and cleaned them up as the best I\ncould and tried and tried and tried\nagain and it just wouldn't work so\nthat's not a user friendly scenario the\npower like when they're working the\npower is good and they're shorter than\nthe rallies which is why I prefer them\nbut yeah they're just fussy and then\ntoday a couple times I went to unclip\nand they're just like a bit of\nhesitation\nas I was coming out and that they were\nClinging On a little more than SPD so\nmy preference and my recommendation to\nyou is if you want a power meter for\ngravel which of course you need data uh\nput it somewhere else besides the pedal\nSRAM makes a great option or Quark I\nshould say which is a strand band a SRAM\nbrand makes a great option highly\nrecommend that if you're a Shimano\nperson I highly recommend stages you can\ndo left right or both sides and then\nfour eyes has a you know similar\nconfiguration so\nthat's my story about power and pedals\nother little bits and Bobs a\npivot branded WTB saddle has a bit of\nSquish\nthis course was so rowdy uh I was happy\nto have that\nwhat I regret not bringing\nbento box for snacks I just went with\nthe pockets building waffle ride is\ngreat about having multiple Aid stations\nalong the way lots of folks out there\nvolunteering holding out not beers\nnecessarily although I saw a few of\nthose I think even the pivot gang was\nout there holding out beers but you know\nholding out multiple\nyou know water bottles yes please right\non thank you sir\noh and the gel snacks Etc so you don't\nhave to pack all this stuff but if\nyou're if you're racing it's good to\nhave snacks with you so I should have\ndone that I had that laid out by the\nsuitcase and\ndecided against it so shame on me\nso for the wafer I believe I ended up\nthird that's what my man on the mic Dave\nho was saying so go check in uh see if\nthere's a Podium for that\nagain what I\nto beat this dead horse it's so cool in\ngravel events and then everybody's still\nmixing together you don't necessarily\nknow where you are in the race unless\nyou are Keegan or Sophia who are you\nknow leading the races and that's okay\nyou can still go hard and ride with\nwhoever you're with like a big giant\ngroup ride on a crazy course that\nhappens to be super well supported\nthe tire question\nMaxis Ramblers is what my man Pat at\npivot who loaned me this bicycle\nrecommended I was leaning towards\nsomething with a little less tread and\nwas happy to have all the tread Keegan\nwas on 45s and if Keegan's on 45s\nthe rest of us probably should be too\nyeah Hannah\ngood times good times\nCrystal Palace at pivot\nwas the founder of Titus the titanium\nnot my grand back in the day\nhe's been designing all sorts of bikes\nfrom the big picture to the small\npicture he was the guy that created BB\n386 Evo which is the bottom bracket\nstandard here he is an Ardent defender\nof the press fit bottom bracket saying\nthat it's not the design that is the\nproblem it's the execution of design for\nthose who say ah but press fits they\njust squeak all the time so he is a big\nbeliever in very tight tolerances one of\nthe many tools in the shop there in\nTempeh is a go no-go device which the\ndifference between go and no go is less\nthan the width of a human hair if you\ncan believe that hi I'm Chris ocalis I'm\nthe CEO of pivot Cycles the this is a go\nno-go gauge so\num bottom bracket head tube uh basically\nany of the key tolerances areas the goat\ngauge has to slide into the frame and\nthe no-go gauge cannot slide into the\nframe and they're\nhello about the difference in size from\nthe thickness of a human hair between\nthe go and the no-go gauge so we don't\ngenerally let the factories make the\ntooling or check gauges for us\non this sort of thing because they won't\nhold those type of tolerances so it's up\nto us to make sure that basically we're\nholding pivot quality on everything and\nso everybody's got the same gauges\nworking off the same tools and the same\nchecklist so this is our history wall\nit's basically every new model of\nsignificance each year so kind of the\nbig hits of each year but then the other\nmodels really really we released in\nthose years are are still listed so in\n2019 is when we introduced the first\nVault\nand then we had a major update to it in\n2020 as well uh which is the current\nbike I think you know when we launched\npivot we were both pivot and BH bikes\nyeah and BH was a partner in pivot\nhelped us financially launch pivot and\nand they really wanted uh BH bikes to be\nin the USA they had no success up to\nthat point\nso we launched two companies pivot\ncycles and BH USA and then we shortly\nthereafter took over all the product\ndevelopment of the high-end BH Road\nproduct so uh 2019 Tour de France we\nlaunched I think it was the G5 so it was\na really good year for us with the First\nfull BH bike that we had designed here\nwith that launch and then developing the\ntriathlon bikes to gravel bikes and so\nuh at some point I forget what year is\nprobably seven years ago the owner of BH\nbikes uh\nJose Luis bastegi was going to retire\nand he wanted to leave the bicycle\ncompany and his Fitness company to his\nchildren but he did not want to have\nPartnerships and he made us a really\nnice offer to purchase BH USA entirely\nand so they moved it to their BH Fitness\ndivision in California and then we were\njust pivot after that point but the last\nproject that I worked on was a new\ngravel bike for BH and one of our kind\nof parting gifts to each other was that\nwe shared those molds they were still\nhell-bent on running cantilever studs on\neverything and I was quickly moving\ntowards disc brakes and so we had\ndifferent sets of chain stain molds and\nthings so that we had some separation in\nthe models but that next year is when\npivot launched\nThe Vault and they launched I forget the\nRX something or other that was still\nkind of a mixed cyclocross gravel bike\nwith cantilever Stones so so we kind of\ncarried on those for until the next\nGeneration in which we designed an\nall-new bicycle so this is the extra\nsmall e vault\npretty much identical geometry to the\nregular Vault and then uh has the fazua\nmotor system removable battery on it\nthese are pretty cool because at their\nclass three so they're 28 mile per hour\nbikes the cool thing about this bike is\nthe motor and Battery completely\ndisengages from the frame uh so there's\na plastic cover you can get for the down\ntube and you can ride it just like a\nregular Vault uh completely\nmuscle bike as the Germans would say or\nacoustic analog\nwhatever the term you want to use for\nnon-e-bike but there's no drag on the\nsystem so really you just without the\nbattery and motor in you're dealing with\nabout a one pound penalty compared to a\nregular Vault\nmakes it really nice for your everyday\nbike and then if you've got\nsome bigger climbs or a recovery day or\nyou just like to have power all the time\ntell me what you make in here\nwe make pretty much everything in here\nso we'll start with making carbon tubes\nfor prototypes and aluminum lugs and\nthen we'll put all that stuff together\nand we'll be able to change those lugs\npretty quickly basically being able to\nbuild a prototype within three to four\nweeks and then if we need to change that\nprototype we can make another set of\naluminum lugs and fixtures pretty\nquickly to adjust geometry on the\nsuspension side anything with kinematics\nwe can just make a lot of adjustments\nreally quickly it takes about half the\ntime now and it used to take with the\naluminum frames and then we can also\ntune the carbon layup identically to\nwhat we're going to use in a production\nbike so with aluminum lugs you get about\na half to three quarters of a pound\nincrease in the overall frame weight but\nwe can still get the ride tuning and the\nquality of the feel of the bike similar\nwe also do all the high-tech check\ntooling here so final fixture checking\ngauges things like handlebar stems\nlinkages dropouts really uh anything\nthat's going to be forged in the future\nwe'll start here and oftentimes times\neven injection molded plastic pieces\nlike covers clamps we'll make the\ntooling we'll actually do some\nprototypes of poor molded parts to get\nit like it's going to be the final\ninjection part and then before we open\nany kind of production tooling\nwe'll have proven it all out here so all\nyour designs get created finalized here\nyes\nCenter Factory built there sitting back\nhere and tested with your very rigorous\nyes half a human hair human hair with\ntolerances yes molded frames in Asia we\nhave these foam inner cores and silicone\nmandrels that that we use this whole\npart gets basically taped together and\nthen we do the entire layup\non on the structure and that structure\ngoes inside the molds stays with the\nframe the entire time the the foam\npieces actually melt inside the airbags\nand we're able to pull them out and then\nwe're able to pull out these silicone\npieces and reuse them in production but\nthe time it takes to make even in\nPrototype form all of these silicone\npieces\nand replacements for the foam Parts was\nmonths and months you can see that some\nof the Prototype\nParts done here versus the production\npieces like this was a layup piece\nthat's water soluble we didn't actually\nget to testing that but the idea was\nthat we could 3D print different\nmaterials and then build the bike on\nthat but uh it the process is long and\nkind of exhaustive to get that done so\nbeing able to make specific tubes\nand then use the lugs it's just\ninfinitely quicker our proprietary\nisoflex system it's basically a system\ndesigned to completely isolate the seat\npost from the frame so you're not\nactually getting suspension travel but\nthe impacts from the road the bumps are\nnot making it fully through to your seat\nbecause it's isolated fully in rubber so\nthe seat post isn't touching the frame\nanywhere the frame is actually holding\nthis rubber part in and uh and then\nit's kind of like a clamp on handle grip\nactually and then it's a lock ring holds\nit separately into the frame in the uh\nkind of the teardrop shape keeps it from\ntwisting\nit it's pretty incredible how it allows\nuh the impact from reaching the rider\nbut also it allows us to make a more\nracy frame so stiffness wise and the way\nyour power transfer is on the bike you\ncan\nit really feels a lot more like a pro\nRoad Race frame and when you start\nbuilding a ton of flex into the seat\nstays\nyou just start to lose stiffness in\nother areas in the bottom bracket and\nbasically some of your performance\nstiffness numbers start to degrade a\nlittle bit with this we can kind of find\na better balance where we can get the\nrider comfortable on the bike and then\nhave the frame be a little bit higher\nperformance as well this was the\ndevelopment of isoflex and the idea of\nlike\nif these heat space get too thin or drop\ntoo far down and you really start to\nbuild a lot of vertical compliance or\ntoo much Flex into the back end of the\nbike you can't also control the\ntorsional stiffness so when you put\npower down on your pedals and you're\nleaning into the bike and putting your\npower down having that back end of the\nbike wrap up badly we really wanted to\nkeep\ngood road bike stiffness out of the bike\nand have some compliance but not go over\nthat edge and so the amount of time that\nwas spent on the isoflex I I don't\nremember how many different iterations\nwere until we got this to work and the\nright durometers and actually the right\nfit between the frame molding and the\nseat post going in and fitting snugly\num that was\nabout a year and a half of of prototypes\nand development just just on that part\nof the bike so and then\njust to have\nworld-class Tire clearance lightweight\nall the key things that you'd want in a\nmodern Cutting Edge bike on a gravel\nbike most companies were basically using\nfor di2 the battery inside the seat post\nbut we have to accommodate dropper posts\nso we have a port at the bottom of the\ndown tube on this one and then it's got\na holder for the di2 battery going\nhorizontally up into the down tube price\nwise this ain't cheap this bad boy with\ndurase 12 speed and Reynolds wheels that\nare stickered up as pivot just shy of 10\ngrand you can get complete bikes\nstarting at 6 500\nand going up from there so like many\nhigh-end bicycles these days are\nthey're not cheap things but boy are\nthey fun to ride\nit's a bottom line bwr Arizona\ntwo Cactus scratched thumbs up pivot\nvaults similar I really enjoyed it like\nthe you know BB at like I think it's 70\nmil drop is low enough to feel stable\nbut not so low that I'm clipping pedals\nand this isoflex thing it works well and\nit's what I think good gravel suspension\nshould be and like it takes a bit of the\nedge off but it doesn't add a bunch of\nweird complexity yeah it looks a little\nbut uh you know you can still use any 27\n2 post you'd like including a dropper\npost so a lot of Versatility there\nso that's it for me I'm going to\nfinish this take a nap in the wash and I\nwill see you guys\nat the Mid-South next week in Stillwater\nOklahoma thanks for watching thanks for\nsubscribing and you know what to do\nenjoy the ride\nthank you\nI'm gonna end up asleep in this wash\nhere if I finish this whole thing"
