      "transcript": "the fight for the podium spots really\nstarted at Mile 78 with the steepest\nclimb on course a 1.6 mile double track\nthat hits a Max gradient of 29 welcome\nback to the channel this video is fueled\nby the feed for those that are\nunfamiliar the Belgian waffle ride\nseries is a North American gravel racing\nseries and while it doesn't get quite as\nmuch attention as the lifetime Grand\nPrix it still attracts some of the\nfastest U.S and international gravel\nracers in fact bwr California is often\none of the most stacked gravel races of\nthe year wait a minute\nwhich part of Belgium is in California\nagain bwr North Carolina attracted its\nfair share of Heavy Hitters as well this\nyear with the likes of former world tour\npro Nathan Haas Adam Roberts fresh off\nof his win at gravel Locos Griffin\nEaster Finn gullickson and more bwr\nraces are known for being under biking\nraces not because they have a rule about\nwhat bike you have to ride but because\nthey designed the course such that it\nencourages under biking the North\nCarolina course is a perfect example of\nthis the 130 mile or 210 kilometer route\nis 60 paved road but then they throw in\nsome of the roughest gravel descents in\nthe area and four fairly significant\nsingle track sections yeah choosing the\nright bike for this course is a real\nhead scratcher on top of that the course\nfeatures 14 000 feet or 4 200 meters of\nclimbing and some of these climbs get\nridiculously steep with sustained\npitches of well over 20 percent all of\nthis makes it arguably the the hardest\nbwr course luckily though I had the home\ngame advantage on my side because I live\nright here in Western North Carolina\nless than 30 minutes from the starting\nline and a lot of the roads used in the\nrace are ones that I ride on a weekly\nbasis this also meant that I had a\npretty good idea of what I wanted my\nbike setup to be I went with my Factor\nAstro gravel which by the way needed a\ncomplete overhaul after the Unbound mud\nfest for tires I opted for my usual 47\nmillimeter Pathfinder Pro Tires that may\nseem excessively wide for a course that\nis the majority pavement but for the\nmost part the pave sections of the\ncourse are not where the race is won or\nlost with the exception of the final\nclimate mile 118 but I'll get to that\ninstead my strategy was to go with a\ntire that would give me an advantage on\nthe Burly sections of the course like\nthe rough gravel descents and single\ntrack sections I know these sections\nbetter than any of my competitors so my\nplan was to make moves anytime it got\ntechnical the only other major change\nthat I made to the bike is I swapped out\nthe 52 and 36 tooth chainrings that I\nused for Unbound with 50 and 34 tooth\nchainrings and an 11 to 34 tooth\ncassette in the back for a bit of an\neasier time getting up some of the Steep\nclimbs throughout the race honestly some\nof the stuff they put in here is stuff\nthat us locals never ride the other big\nquestion mark for this race is how my\nlegs would be feeling after doing the\nUnbound 200 just seven days earlier one\nweek is normally not enough time to\nfully recover from such a massive effort\nlike Unbound but a lot of the top\ncontenders at this race were at Unbound\nas well so at least we'd all be in the\nsame boat that being said I completely\nshocked myself by getting my highest 20\nminute power ever just four days after\nUnbound you heard that right this was\ncompletely unexpected I was just doing a\n10 minute threshold effort to open my\nlegs up for bwr and I felt so good at\nthe 10 minute mark that I just decided\nto go another 10 minutes and ended up\ndoing 402 Watts for 20. although my\nheart rate was a bit depressed during\nthis effort indicating that there was\nstill a bit of fatigue this is 11 Watts\nhigher than my previous best 20 minute\npower that I had set last summer I don't\nknow how this happened but I wasn't\ngoing to question it and I just hoped\nthat my legs were going to feel this\ngood on race day nah I think you need to\ncalibrate your power meter man I mean\nthat just sounds\nembarrassingly low bro come on I do that\non my easy days all right I know that\nwas a lot of setup but I felt like the\nfull context was needed before getting\ninto this one but with that let's go\nahead and get into how the race played\nout the first major pinch point on\ncourse comes early at Mile eight and\nwhen I say pinch point I'm talking about\na two mile uphill single track section\ngetting into this section in bad\nposition could seriously jeopardize your\nrace because probably the top 20 or so\nRiders will be riding the whole thing\nbut the further back you get in the\nfield the more people will have to get\noff and run the Steep Switchback\nsections at which point you'll be losing\na lot of time knowing this I tried to\nstay as close as I could to the front\nwithout being in the Wind on the road\nleading into this section this was\neasier said than done because attacks\nwere already going here on the pavement\nand gaps were opening up it was clear\nthat everyone knew that the single track\nwas coming and did not want to be the\none caught out in 20th or 30th position\nand these efforts start the race\nrequired a normalized power of 330 Watts\nfor 18 minutes as we approach the single\ntrack I surged to the front and got the\nwhole shot if I could lead in The Single\ntrack I would be able to dictate the\npace and keep from going too far into\nthe red after all we were only eight\nmiles into a 130 mile race that being\nsaid looking back on it I really didn't\ntake it that easy doing another 332\nWatts NP for 10 minutes up the single\ntrack but this opening climb of the race\ndoesn't end when you get out of the\nsingle track instead we continue to\nclimb for another six miles on gravel\nthe gravel is smooth and the gradient is\npretty mild to begin with but towards\nthe top it gets extremely chunky and\nSteep and both thin gullickson and Alan\nSchroeder were really pushing the pace\nto try to create separations in an\nalready reduced front group of about 15\nRiders this meant another 336 Watts for\n23 minutes and the entire first climb\ntook 38 minutes at 3 30 NP let me stress\nthis again we were only 15 miles into a\n130 mile race after this climb we had a\npretty significant Nine Mile gravel\ndescent with numerous rough sections and\nblind turns and like I said at the top\nof the video this is where I wanted to\nmake moves happen Nathan Haas and I\ntraded turns on the front here small\ngaps opened up in the front group behind\nand whenever I looked back I could tell\nthat Riders were having to do a lot of\nwork to close down these gaps which was\nperfect this is one of the rare times\nwhere I think that being on the front\nand driving the pace actually saved\nenergy because knowledge of the course\nand Technical handling skills is what\nallowed an advantage after The Descent\nwe got about five minutes of respite\nbefore we tackled the first of the three\nmost brutal climbs on the course a seven\nmile rough double track straight up the\nmountain with some pitches that had us\nbarely staying on our bikes up this\nclimate it was Finn and Griffin who\ndecided to light it up they were\nobviously very confident in their\nclimbing ability because they seemed to\njust keep turning the screws harder and\nharder the steeper it got the first\npitch which is the steepest took 20\nminutes at 347 NP and the entire 37\nminute climb required an NP of 323 watts\nand this meant that for the first hour\nand 53 minutes of this race we had a\nnormalized power of 312 watts in case\nyou were wondering how brutal the\nterrain was all that effort only\nproduced an average speed of 16.5 miles\nper hour or 26.5 kilometers per hour\nthat being said the next 45 miles of the\nrace is a lot malower both in terms of\nthe steepness of the gradients and the\nruggedness of the terrain and since the\nfirst two hours was so hard we already\nhad a greatly reduced lead group of just\n10 or so Riders which meant that the\npace over the next 45 miles eased up a\nlot doing just 244 Watts for the next\ntwo and a half hours there were a few\ntimes where a rider would set a hard\nPace up a climb but for the most part we\nfound ourselves riding pretty\ncomfortably after all the last 50 miles\nof the race goes over some of the same\nbrutal terrain that was used in the\nfirst 30 miles just in the opposite\ndirection meaning that some of the\ntoughest sections of the course were yet\nto come and the race was really going to\nbe decided there the fight for the\npodium spots really started at Mile 78\nwith the steepest climb on course a 1.6\nmile double track that hits a Max\ngradient of 29 The Climb kicks up\nimmediately on chunky gravel but the\nsteepest pitch is about halfway up and I\nwas nearly cross-eyed just trying to\nkeep the crank spinning and the bike\nupright it took 402 Watts for two and a\nhalf minutes just to ride five miles per\nhour up this steep section and honestly\nif the power had been any lower than\nthat you'd probably be walking at that\npoint the entire climb took nearly 10\nminutes with an NP of 364 Watts right\nafter this climb is a cyclocross style\nSwitchback descent on a narrow grassy\nTrail by the time we got to the bottom\nour group of 10 or so Riders had\nshattered and now there were just five\nRiders making up the front Group which\nincluded Nathan Haas Griffin Easter Finn\ngullickson Adam Roberts and me we worked\ntogether on the road section for the\nnext 10 minutes to cement our Gap but\nnot long after that we would hit gravel\nagain and our Focus would turn to\ndropping each other the next gravel\nclimb was nine miles long but the\norganizers threw us a curveball and had\nus turn into single track about halfway\nup it Nathan took the lead going into\nthe single track but not long after that\nI got by him and I decided that this\nwould be a good time to try to fracture\nthis front group this section of Trail\ntook about eight minutes and in that\ntime I did an NP of 323 Watts when I\nexited the single track I looked back\nand I saw that I had about a 30 second\nGap over the other four riders for the\nnext 11 minutes I attempted to grow this\nGap doing 314 watts in the process but\nAdam and Finn reeled me back in and now\nwe had a front group of three over the\nnext hour and a half or so I tried\nmultiple times to drop these two Riders\nattacking on rough gravel descents\nsingle track sections and I even made a\nmove on a paved climb doing 416 Watts\nfor three and a half minutes but these\ntwo Riders were still glued to my wheel\nat Mile 115 we came up on the last major\nclimb of the day and I knew that this\nwas likely where the race was going to\nbe decided it was a one and a half mile\nsteep paved climb before a gravel\ndescent with chunky and loose corners on\nthis final climb Adam attacked close to\nthe bottom and Finn and I simply had no\nresponse over the next 10 minutes I\nwould see Adam slowly Fade Away into the\ndistance while I kept Finn within 10 10\nseconds of me at this point in the race\nwith just 15 miles left to go there was\nno holding back that was everything I\nhad this effort took about nine minutes\nat 352 Watts at the top I asked the\nspectator what the Gap to Adam was and\nhe said that it was about a minute so I\nfigured that getting the win was no\nlonger an option but I still had Finn to\ncontend with for second place he crested\nThe Climb about 10 seconds ahead of me\nand I quickly closed that back down on\nthe gravel descent that followed when we\ngot to the bottom of the Descent the\nlead Moto told us that Adam was only 20\nseconds ahead of us and I thought surely\nhe can't be that close but then I looked\nin the distance and sure enough there he\nwas and within 30 seconds we had caught\nhim this should have set off alarm bells\nin my head that Adam was hurting at this\npoint but I'm going to be honest I was\nhurting pretty bad at this point too\nsure enough Adam would tell me after the\nrace that he was experiencing really bad\ncramping when we caught him had we just\nattacked him as soon as we made the\ncatch we probably would have dropped him\ninstantly but of course I didn't know\nthat at the time over the next six miles\nleading into the Finish we just soft\npedaled and looked at each other doing\nan NP of just 210 Watts I was waiting\nfor some sort of attack but it never\ncame I think all three of us were on our\nlimit at this point in the race going\ninto the Sprint Finn was leading Adam\nwas second wheel and I was third wheel\nAdam started his Sprint extremely early\nand I thought this is perfect is\nessentially just going to lead me out\nbut the Finish is quite technical with a\nlot of grass corners and roots to\nmaneuver around and I wasn't able to\ncome around Adam by the finish and he\ntook the win and I was a bike length or\ntwo back in second place in hindsight I\nthink Adam going early into the\ntechnical Sprint was actually a very\nsmart move on his part and he's just a\nbetter Sprinter than I am in this final\nSprint I hit a max power of 1022 watts\nand 850 for 10 seconds looking back over\nthe entire race it took 7 hours and 24\nminutes I had a normalized power of 280\nan average power of 224 average heart\nrate of 145 max heart rate 178 which is\nvery low for me in a race perhaps a sign\nof lingering fatigue from Unbound\naverage speed of 17.6 miles per hour or\n28 kilometers per hour just over 6 000\nkilojoules and 462 TSS this is my\nhighest placing ever at Abita WR race so\nobviously I'm extremely happy about it\nbut the fact that Adam who's a fellow\njukebox Factor writer won the race made\nit that much better yeah but did Adam do\nany polling during the race though I\nneed to decide whether or not to get mad\nabout this on social media on behalf of\nthe spirit of gravel and this race\nwrapped up one of my most successful\nblocks of racing so far with a top 10 at\ngravel Locos a top 20 at Unbound and a\nPodium here at bwr I think I'm in the\nbest shape that I've ever been in and it\nreally does seem like the extra volume\nthat I did this spring has paid off\nmaybe I'll do a video in the near future\nabout exactly what that training looked\nlike if you want to follow my racing\ncloser be sure to check me out on\nInstagram if you enjoyed this video be\nsure to give it a like subscribe and\nshare it with your

      "transcript": "[Music]\nforeign\nabsolutely\neach other\ntake help\nwelcome to my recap of the\n2022 north carolina belgium waffle ride\nright from the start there you can see\nthat the neutral zone was exciting\nit was moving quick and a lot was\nhappening\nbut this video is just going to be a\nrecap of the belgian waffle ride and\nkind of some of the highlights of the a\nlot of the off-road sections there'll be\na little bit of road in there\nbut first we're going to get started off\nwith a quick look at what i was riding\nso\nyou can see my bike on the screen right\nnow i'm on a cervelo asparo paired with\nsome gulo wheels they're the cga38s um\nit's kind of like their aero wheel set\ni i'm really digging them uh i've had\nthem for i guess a few weeks now\nand\ni've written them on my revolt and on my\nsparrow and big fan on both bikes but i\nhave a cervelo sparrow and it has sram\nrival\nor sram force axis etap\nand i'm using a quark or i guess the\nsram power meter which is new to me yeah\ni really love the bike and that's what i\nwas riding i had 40 millimeter\nmaxis ramblers which i think was a\ncorrect choice i had a really\ni had a buddy who was doing the course\nhe spent the night with me the night\nbefore i think he wrote 36 almost like\nfile treads\num\ni'd i wouldn't have done that i tried to\nconvince him it was a bad idea he's a\nreally good bike handler though so i\nthink that he made it through just fine\nbut that's the bike i was riding uh and\nyeah this is the belgium waffle rod so\nwe're just gonna go ahead and jump right\ninto kind of some of the\nsegments that came after that neutral\nzone and what it looks like\nnow\nuh\nall right so a bit to unpack there and\nthe chaos of the ride that was like the\nfirst\ni don't know 30 minutes of the ride uh\nsome of the paved sections it's been\ncatching a lot of flack recently kind of\nin the in the gravel pro scene\num the ignoring of the double yellow\nline\nthat is very common i've mentioned in my\nvideos before uh other people are\nstarting to mention it now on instagram\nstuff like that it's very common in\ngravel events that the double yellow is\npretty much ignored the rules of the\nroad are a little ignored um\nthankfully the bwr did have some coarse\nmarshals but really not\nenough for you to just be blowing\nthrough\nevery stop sign you saw and for you to\nbe crossing double yellow anyway\nwell someone else will talk about that\nissue i'm i'm just a guy that rides\ngravel sometimes um you can kind of see\nthat very last clip that you saw is me\ndeciding that i didn't want to ride at\nthat pace uh i knew that i really i\ncouldn't race 132 miles i've not really\nbeen as diligent about my training this\nyear so i knew i just couldn't race 132\nmiles so i was kind of there to have fun\nand ride and that was me deciding at\nthat point to not stick with that lead\ngroup anymore and that was a pretty\nstrategic call on my part because i knew\nthat\nlake falls climb was coming up which is\na climb i love i ride it very often so i\nknew that was coming up and that's kind\nof what we're gonna dive into next here\n[Applause]\nso that was lake falls up um it's a very\nsteep well not very steep i made that up\nit's not very steep it's pretty long uh\nit's maybe like i think the kom right\nnow is 11 minutes or something like that\ni used to have the kom before bwr came\nthrough and my previous fastest time was\nsomething like 14 minutes\nbut in that segment going up lake falls\nembarrassingly i sent my 20 minute power\npr for 2022 so obviously training has\nnot been a huge priority for me but i\nwas able to kind of\nride through a bunch of groups and kind\nof at this point the race had split into\nthe main lead group and then there were\na bunch of stragglers um\ni thankfully just kind of met up with uh\ni ended up kind of i think in the lead\nchase group they were kind of doing some\nfunny stuff hill jamming wasn't a fan so\ni kind of sat up dropped myself from\nthat uh ended up in the third group\nthey were also doing the same thing hill\njamming so on the next gravel segment i\nended up just dropping all that and then\ni just kind of cruised at my own pace i\ndid end up in this group that we're\nabout to see and this is kind of my\nmy favorite section of the course this\nis the falling creek segment and this is\nthe one that goes right by my house and\nthis is the segment that i did a lot of\nwork on to get the race to come through\nand i did all like the weed eating\nchainsawing all that work it is my job\nat fallen creek so it's not like i did\nit just for the race but yeah this is\nkind of the next segment we're gonna\njump into\nthank you\nso you can see all that chunky gravel uh\nhonestly i didn't expect that people\nwould already be off the bike there and\nwalking especially not in\nkind of the the\nsomeone that was chasing in towards i\ndon't know where they were hoping to\nfinish maybe\n30th uh\ni didn't think people in that high of\nthe\nfield would be walking some of those\ngravel sections that was a surprise to\nsee but in their defense the gravel is\nreally chunky\nbut that's like kind of the bottom\nand it leads into this crazy steep\nsection\nso we hit that big steep section and\nthen i think the view at the top is\nworth it\nvery beautiful view i get to mow that\nfield as part of my job so i enjoy that\nview all the time hanging out up there\nand admittedly\ni had tried to leave a lot of\ngas in the tank just for that climb\nbecause i knew i had my gopro and i knew\nthat i wanted to film myself being able\nto clean it i was really worried i was\ngoing to unclip and kind of ruin\nruin my footage but i managed to hang in\nthere and so that was what you were\nlooking at right there and i honestly i\ndo think that that's the toughest part\nof the course\nit doesn't necessarily feel like it\nbecause you hit it at like mile\n52 or something like that\nso you're still somewhat fresh\nand i know that from watching some other\nuh replays like carrie warner and peter\nstetna's post race interview apparently\nthat's where the lead group blew up they\nwent in there as a group of almost 30\nand then a small group of eight came out\nthe other side pretty splintered and\nthat was just really cool because\nthat's uh yeah right by my house which\nwe're about to see in this next little\nbit\nhey\ni gotta use the pork body\ncan you hand me those\nso you can see how it popped out of the\nfield there and at that point uh there\nwas a water issue\nour house had water hadn't had water for\nat least like eight or nine days and we\nhad a porta potty in our yard and i had\nto make a bee line straight for that\nporta potty i don't know what i i think\ni had some weird oatmeal the morning of\nthe race\nbut yeah so i i got to see my wife which\nwas really cool and i stashed some\nbottles\nand some snacks so that was kind of my\nbig rest stop i stopped there um grabbed\na couple new bottles grabbed some snacks\nand then kept rolling and this next bit\nuh we\neveryone probably hoped that we were\ndone with the climbing unfortunately you\nhave to climb again before you get out\nof camp and then you have a pretty quick\ndescent down to the covered bridge so\nwe're gonna check that out and then head\nover on to pinnacle\nso that was pinnacle uh if you've never\nridden it it's definitely worth checking\nout it's uh\na very long\nwith some steep gradients it's probably\nthe longest sustained gravel climb that\nwe did during the event\nand the top is just pretty chunky and it\nhas some spots that are kind of ripping\ndescents they're very fast i think a lot\nof people probably flatted in that\nsection i know that i saw\ntwo or three people just on the side of\nthe road fixing flats during my laps and\nwe do do that portion twice in the bwr\nso you do it once normally and then the\nsecond time you go around you do it\nslightly different but the big thing is\nafter that you you hit all that\ndescending and then you kind of go into\nthe finish of the dirt diggler if you've\never ridden the dirt diggler it's a\nreally cool event the left from reeb\nthis year the bwr used that same single\ntrack bombing into there and so that's\nthe section we're going to check out\nhere and this is probably\nthis was the toughest part of the course\ni think for me that it was the sustained\nsingle track descending uh i will never\nsay that i'm the best bike handler and i\nwas you know a little on edge this whole\ntime uh you can probably hear my brakes\na lot in this next section but i was\njust trying to hold it together and not\nnot have too big of a mistake yeah this\nis the reeb ranch section and i thought\nit was really cool definitely the barn\nat the end was a lot of fun\nspooky\nis\ni'll be quiet\nso once i made that left turn onto the\npavement i normally really don't like\nriding through there because that is\nactually statin road which goes right by\ndupont so if you've been to like lake\nimaging um or any of those big dupont\nparking lots\nthat's where that is uh i usually don't\nlike riding there because there's a lot\nof traffic but this time i was actually\nlooking forward to it because it was a\nlong\npaved section and i knew that i could\nkind of just get back into a rhythm\nbecause that single track really just\nthrew me out of it\nbut you do that single track and then\nyou make a left at the very end and you\ngo back and you do another pinnacle lap\na smaller side i ended up making a right\nand going down cascade i listened to\npeople who i thought were horse marshals\nand i listened to someone i was riding\nwith and i shouldn't have against my\nbetter judgment i knew it was left but i\nwent right so i ended up doing a little\nbit of extra in the bwr which is always\nyou know why not tack on some extra\nmiles\nbut you you go left and then we're gonna\nlook at a little bit of footage next\nfrom kind of the exclusive green river\npreserve single track which is off of\npinnacle\nso we'll take a look at that and then\nkind of after that we're just gonna do\na bit of a recap of the whole event\nbecause really after that single track i\ndidn't do any filming because one it was\njust the rebranch descent again\nand then it was cascade lake which is\npretty standard and then after cascade\nlake you're kind of in the clear you\njust go climb the bottom of jeter and\nthen you're back at canoga uh so that's\nwhere we're heading to here after this\nknow my body never knows\nyeah so that was the that was the bwr\ni'm gonna put the data on the screen\nright now and you can see my moving time\nwas just under nine hours thankfully\neight hours and fifty minutes it was 131\nmiles that's my tss in the upper right\n467 and honestly five to six hundred is\nlike a good week of training so seeing a\ntss of 467 was\noof um you can see 6 000 calories\nnormalized power at 231\naverage wattage of 189\noverall i'm really pleased with my ride\ni definitely managed to just hold it\ntogether i didn't i never blew up i\nnever felt like quitting um\nnutritionally i was solid there were a\ncouple points where i wish i had had a\nlittle bit more water i probably should\nhave been drinking more but other than\nthat it was just a good a good ride\ni didn't have any expectations for\nfinishing the results i think when i\nchecked it and the overall i was like\n65th or something like that so certainly\nyou know nothing to write home about but\nit was a really cool event\ni'm glad i did it i'm glad that it went\nmy home that was really neat\nand will i do it again uh\nprobably not but mostly because i'm\nmoving to japan and so\nin about\nfive and a half weeks uh i will be\nmoving to ishikawa\nin japan and i will be lit there for at\nleast a year with my wife we'll be uh\njust living over there i'll be teaching\nenglish um\nso no i won't be doing it next year if i\nwas in the u.s and i was here\nyeah i'd probably sign up for it um\nit's an experience it's cool\nworth doing it's a big old day uh maybe\nnot worth treating like a race if you\njust go and you do the ride because\nhonestly\nif you treat it like a race it's really\nhard because the top\n20 people are\nprobably legitimate professionals they\nspend so much time riding and if you're\nspending\nyou know 10 hours a week on the bike\nthat's\nreally good training but it's hard to\ncompete with people who are\nracing professionally but yeah so that\nwas the bwr i hope you enjoyed the video\nand we will uh check you guys later"

dylan\njohnson dylan how are you man good how\nyou doing i'm great buddy it's great to\nhave you here with us yeah thank you\nthis is a special place you got here in\nyour part of the world yeah um what what\nwhat's your favorite part about it what\ndo you like the most why do you live\nhere\nwhy do i live here well i did go to\ncollege at brevard college just down the\nroad\nand uh voted cycling powerhouse college\nright yeah yeah multiple uh\nmountain bike national championships and\ncyclocross national championship wins so\num\nif i'm honest uh that was probably the\nmain reason i went to that school not\nthe education\nso\nbut uh yeah i mean the cycling here is\ngreat i'm biased but i think the\nmountain biking here is the best on the\neast coast and\nthe gravel is is up there as well your\nsocial is always full of you tracking\naround these beautiful trails and things\nlike that yeah a lot of the roads on\nthis course are roads that i ride on a\nweekly basis so that's gorgeous yeah um\na good run for you last week at unbound\nyes you got the dirt and stuff finally\noff of you how did you feel how's the\nbody recovering uh i was i was in rough\nshape yesterday i i'll be honest\ni was close to deciding not to race and\nthat is not something that i typically\ndo especially when it's a race right\nhere in my backyard\nrode the bike today legs felt good\nenough and i'm racing tomorrow love it\num speaking with that then you've seen\nthe course you know the course you know\nevery inch of the course any favorite\nparts out there or parts that you know\nare going to really hurt some people\nyeah well i think the parts that are\ngoing to hurt people are the parts that\nare on private property that i actually\ndon't know myself falling creek and\nplaces like that yeah i mean that's some\nreally steep terrain out there i know\nthere's some single track sections that\nare going to be hard to maneuver on a\ngravel bike\nif there's any way any place on the\ncourse that's going to hurt people it's\nprobably those sections and people are\nnot allowed to pre-ride them either so\neveryone's going to be going in blind\nyeah\nthey're beautiful too like it's gonna be\nhard i think for most people to keep\ntheir eye on the bike and the front\nwheel because the scenery is just so\ngorgeous right\num let's talk a little bit about\ncalifornia bwr um what was your maybe\nmost memorable experience of that event\nyeah i uh to be honest california bwr\nwas a bit of a rough race for me this\nyear but um i mean it's it's always fun\nto be back there um\nrough in what sense well i don't know i\ni felt like i kind of cracked halfway\nthrough and then and then i was just\nkind of struggling to the finish\nmaybe burnt a few too many matches not\nbeing in good position going into those\nthose first opening single track\nsections\nit's always such a struggle to kind of\nget in the top 20 into those single\ntrack sections so\ni was i was a waze back there so\ni i don't know if i'm in with a shot at\nthe quadruple crown this year but i\ndon't know we'll see you got to show up\nto do it you know right right\nrace who's there and it's it seemed like\nlast year those who showed up for all\nthree races\ndid well in the triple crown yeah\nbecause there were so many races on the\ncalendar and it's it's hard to make you\nknow every bwr race work for everyone\nright right and each course is so\nuniquely different anyway you have to\nkind of in some ways prepare for that in\nits own special way\nspeaking of preparation the bike is a\nkey part of that\nany changes from the bike from last week\nat unbound to this course this week the\nonly difference is that i'm not running\naero bars okay and uh obviously aerobars\nare not allowed at bwr but i don't know\nthat i would run them anyway for this\ncourse because it's a very climate\ncourse\nand the tactics are going to be a little\nbit different um i'm even running the\nsame tires that i ran at unbound that\naffordably going with 42 specialized\npathfinder pros um probably a lot of\npeople that may seem a little wide but\nthere's some chunky single track out\nthere there's some chunky gravel out\nthere\ni know it's a lot of road but i tend to\npick the tire for the roughest section\nof the course okay\nand and\ngive up that sort of\nthe tire friction issue kind of set that\naside well\nwhat you usually find is that when\nyou're on the road uh the group is is\nsort of working together and there's not\nthere's not a tax going it's not a\ndecisive point in the race when you get\nto those chunky gravel sections or\nsingle track sections that's where it's\ndecisive and that's where you need to\nhave the advantages it's not always like\nthat it depends race to race in in my\nopinion in this race that's probably\nwhat it's going to be like yeah most of\nthose sections you think on on on a\nclimb or on a descent or\nyou obviously have to have good traction\nregardless but like where is it going to\nbe the most important i mean it could be\nboth so\nthere's a pretty nasty climb on pinnacle\nmountain road where attacks could easily\nfly and then right after pinnacle\nmountain road we descend some single\ntrack through re-branch um somebody with\ngood bike handling skills could easily\nget\n30 seconds to a minute there if they\nreally know what they're doing so\nre-branch known for its mountain biking\nas well right right beer's spelled\nbackwards we love that exactly um quick\nhit on the youtube what are you working\non the youtube channel what are we gonna\nsee next yeah well i gotta get the\nunbound recap up i haven't had a lot of\ntime to work on it this week because um\njust been you know\ntraveling back and recovering and\ngetting some podcasts out but i'll get\nthe on-bound recap up i've got two more\nuh episodes with steven seiler about\npolarized training to get to\nand then you know if there's some\ninteresting stuff to talk to\nthe audience about this race i'll maybe\ni'll make a recap about this race as\nwell oh man we'd love it if you did\ngreat\na few minutes here with our man dylan\njohnson watch for him tomorrow and our\non road unbound i'm sorry on road on\nlive coverage\ntomorrow on the unroad unlimited page\nhe'll be one of the main protagonists on\nthe men's side so thanks for tuning in\nto this episode of the unroad download\npresented by bmc we've got lots more to\ncome here from belgium waffle ride north\ncarolina"
