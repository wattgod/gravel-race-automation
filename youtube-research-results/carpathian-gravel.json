      "description": "\u201cWhat to say about Ga\u00eblle that isn't all superlatives... I could list all that I know and I still don't think they capture the spirit and determination of someone like her. I first heard of this young French woman touring on her own in the winter, in the cold and snowy mountains to the east of Europe when I was also living a nomadic bike life but in the dry, south of the Iberian peninsula. I felt a little humbled by seeing such strength of character of someone at such an age, as when I was younger it was mostly parties and late nights for me. The pictures and stories that she shares from her adventures tell a great deal about what it's like to tour on a bike throughout the year, and the small insight she grants us into her experiences are things to be enjoyed again and again. Chapeau Ga\u00eblle, bon courage!\u201d ( Andy Cox, founder of https://www.instagram.com/europeandividetrail)\n\nIn 2019 Ga\u00eblle and her ARISE TOUR bike headed out for an staggering loop around Europe, covering all it's countries within. From the heat of southern Spain to the frozen coast of Scandinavia, while traversing the Carpathians somewhere in the middle, home to brown bears and wolves. Crossing the Carpathian and following its mountain curve from south to north this area also holds a little insight for her personally, as this is where her grandad hales from, it is also about the Carpathian\u2019s rough roads and \u2013 rain, loads of rain. From what we know of her last movies about Turkey and Great Britain we are already excited about another episode and her skilled eye to put situations in scene as to let pictures talk emotionally.\n\nCycled, filmed & produced by Ga\u00eblle Bojko. \n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/biketotheblocks/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/biketotheblocks/\nhttps://bombtrack.com/family/gaelle/ \n\nSoundtrack used with friendly permission:\n\nDead Man\u2019s Eyes \u201cThis Old Place\u201d & \u201cTwo Dozen Eyes\u201d.

      "description": "For new cyclists, riding gravel and solitary dirt roads is a natural solution to the problems of road riding or mountain biking. Traffic on paved roads scares many new cyclists, and the absence of a safe shoulder or the threatening presence of a gutter strewn with broken glass and debris can be paralyzing. The technical skills required for mountain biking are also an impediment for many. Riding gravel and dirt roads, on the other hand, offers a quiet cycling experience with only a minimal amount of cycling prowess required.",

      "transcript": "luckily I made some shots yesterday\nthere's no view today look at that foggy\nwell today's gonna be the other day\nthere's loads of ups and downs Lu\nSherrod is not that far so I think about\n80 club and so I might make it to that\nplace it's behind the carpathian so we\nhave to move across the whole mountain\nrace to make it yeah I feel pretty good\nI had a great night's sleep right here\ndidn't get disturbed there are some dogs\nfar in the distance that's very nice\n[Music]\n[Applause]\nthe mountains are covered in mist and\nyou get the FK the occasional downpour\ngame kinda like yesterday I have to say\nMIT also quite a bit but those are so\nsteep and so fast before you know you're\nin the valley again and you have to\nclimb yourself out of there which can\ntake ages so you see that behind me guys\nI just had to go through a military\ncheckpoint oh and the road starts I mean\ntheir owners been carpet so far and now\nit's yeah it's just all of a sudden I\nhad to show my my passport I think it's\nbecause we are in a different Oblast\nright now which is kind of like a\ndifferent region different province\nI need both my hands to be on the brakes\nall the time because I cannot go faster\nthan maybe 10 kilometers an hour from\nhere on it's just downhill I think so\nthat's pretty good\nso I think there guy in the last shot\nthat you saw I think he noticed that I\nwill fill me she sort of gave me a hug\nit was it was very interesting he said\nEnglish I said yes I said Holland and he\nsaid Amsterdam that's often what people\nknow like of Holland Sampson and then in\nmy case it's just it's wanted to give me\na hug that was pretty interesting\nyeah they are quite lovely I have to say\neven though they don't have much you\nknow you can see the poverty especially\nthis area where the roads are often\npretty bad but the people here are just\nvery nice amazing man this is a good\nroad well the quality is bad but the\nsurroundings are really amazing stunning\nplus no big ups or down heels because\nvery right next to the river\nhuge and we're going to a town called\nJewish girl roads which kind of like\nmeans the the village of Boosh\nso I think this is gonna be just a\ngradual downhill actually to that\nvillage we have already gone down seven\nhundred five hundred meters and yeah we\njust keep on going down it's just a few\ntiny up hills but it's freaking gorgeous\nman\nit's really nice I think I'm in the\nright Valley as well because there's no\nrain here\nI do see some dark clouds around but\nyeah it's just pure enjoyment\ngoes over a minute more than a minute\nall right guys I think we're gonna make\nit to lose girl tonight today it's just\n20 kilometers and it's just fs3 right\nnow they'll be easy that means that we\nhave successfully crossed the Carpathian\nMountains it was easier than I thought\nactually the last I think the last half\nwhen the roads became bad this morning\nwe've only been going down very very\ngradually so we started at like 900\nmeters above sea level right now we're\nat 160 and Hoosier elders had round I\nthink I don't on 30 so it's very very\neasy only the first half was a bit hard\nwith a lot of ups and downs but because\nwe're following this River has been very\ngradual since so it's yeah it's really\ngreat\nanyways who's not gonna eat something\nthere and try to find a hotel for\ntonight and probably stay for two nights\nI look a bit strange but they didn't\nhave they didn't have a bigger plate so\nI wanted three pieces I mean the town\ngirls right now as you can see I'm in\nthe center right now nice place very\nnice and yeah that's about it for\nrecycling in Ukraine I'm gonna cross the\nborder not far from here it's a border\ncross to Slovakia but I'm probably gonna\nstay here for two more days because\nfirst it's cheap here and second my\nsunglasses I on a big downhill they fell\nout of my front back they were kinda\nlike hanging on the side so they broke\nand I lost my knife in live if that was\nstill back in love if I lost my knife\nand yeah that's about it so I'm gonna\neat these afterwards try to find a hotel\nfor the night and I'll be good so for\ntonight I've got a hostel I just booked\nit by a booking.com from the pictures it\nlooks pretty good but it's just 4 euros\na night that's the cheapest I've ever\nstayed at some place you know yeah I\nhope it's any good on the pictures it\nlooks pretty good\nit's a hostel though so I will be\nsleeping with other people in the room\nprobably which is not the worst I've\ndone that before so she'll be doable and\nthis is what you call bang for the book\nthis is my bed I'm up I would like to be\ndown but these are already taken these\ntwo so we're with three for now I hope\nthere's not gonna be a fourth one that\nwill be pretty nasty that's how far so\ngood a little Locker right here safe and\nthis is really cool this is like the\nliving space area he got some table some\ncouches a TV the view it's not do good\nit's the weather it's been so nice it's\ncraziness\nthey've got Wi-Fi right there a boiler\nmicrowave\nI've already had dinner\nand here's the bathroom with your sink\ntoilet\nsee I'll be staying here for two days\nand then I'm gonna cross the border into\nSlovakia so that is really nice oh yeah\ndid I mention that already four bucks a\nnight that is budget that is what I\nneeded guys because yeah I've been\nthinking money's running real low and\nand I want to make a video about because\nsometimes I say I've done work I wanted\nto in a video I want to talk about what\nthat work actually is and what it all\nentails because it's pretty hard to\nexplain\nright now I do want to make a video on\nthat because it's probably gonna be a\nmain chapter for the next months\nprobably but first I'm gonna meet my\nparents its first gonna happen and we're\ngonna be budged to impro but afterwards\nthings are probably gonna change up\ntoday I actually fall off a plan you\ncould say which is really interesting\nand I wanna I want to share that plan\nsoon but not yet because that plan is\nstill very well probable I mean I\nhaven't even told it to anyone yet I\nstill I first want to talk to it about\nwith some with some people that I know\nprobably with my family as well but it\nwill be awesome I think I have a few\nchoices for the future and I think this\noption is pretty cool but I just I can't\ntell yet I'm sorry I have to hold on to\nthis one and let you guys know later if\nthis is gonna happen some very big\nchanges are gonna happen to the tour for\nnow anyways that's it for this video\nguys I'm sure I'm gonna leave you with\nthis weird cliffhanger but yeah some\nchanges are gonna happen like inevitably\nbut anyways that's it for this video\njust like it if you liked it please\nleave calm down below please subscribe\nalready enjoy today's real live and I'll\nsee you guys tomorrow bye"
