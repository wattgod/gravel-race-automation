      "description": "This is my view of the 2024 Cedar Blitz Gravel Race, which takes place in Cedar Springs, MI. This race is the 36 mile distance, starting and finishing in front of Cedar Springs Brewing Company on Main St. in Cedar Springs. The race took place on July 13, 2024, with the weather being a toasty 75F, calm, and humid at the starting line.\n\nThis course is quite flat, allowing for high speeds and solid drafting tactics. I ended up in a great group a couple miles into the gravel, and we worked together for most of the race. With a few miles left, five of us decided to crank up the pace a little and broke off the front. I ended up hitting a wall after a few turns on the front but then did my best to beat that pack I had ridden with to the finish line.\n\nThis was an awesome event, so kudos to Rogue Racing Promotions for their efforts in putting this together and running a top-notch event!\n\nCameras: GoPro Hero 11 (front), GoPro Hero 9 (back)\nBike: 2024 Intense 951 Gravel\n\n0:00 - Neutral Roll Out\n7:45 - Start of the Gravel\n11:40 - Early Groups\n16:00 - Myers Lake\n19:35 - Back to Gravel\n21:40 - Riding the Mid-pack Train\n1:22:00 - Getting Organized on the Front\n1:24:45 - Breaking Away From the Group\n1:30:50 - Unable to Keep up the Pace\n1:36:30 - Trying to Beat the Group to the Line",

SUBSCRIBE for free WATTS \ud83d\udc49 https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsr-SU_SAqjrzmu4kXIRfUQ?sub_confirmation=1\n\nThe Cedar Blitz gravel race took place on July 13th, 2024 in Cedar Springs, MI. As part of the Michigan Gravel Race Series (MGRS) the \"Long\" course was the 50 mile version.  \n\nThe race started with a 2 mile neutral roll out until we hit the gravel.  Legs felt good and I was able to stay with the lead group. However, this group was quite big with 33 riders making it to the finish line. This was despite numerous attempts at breakaways throughout the race. The last mile into the finish line was pretty sketchy. I tried to make myself towards the front in the final couple miles knowing that there was a high speed chicane with some loose corners. I thought I was about top 10-15 wheels, but I was actually closer to 25th. So I was out of position and to make mattes worse we were passing riders from shorter race course distances. I had to do several mini sprints to make up spots and had nothing left for my actual sprint at the finish line.  I clawed back a few places and ended up 18th overall, just 6 seconds behind first.\n\nHappy with the results but I actually got all time 3rd on the Strava segment \"Cedar Blitz Final Sprint\". Which means I had the power, I just messed up the lead in to the finish.  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 Hey!

      "description": "The Cedar Blitz 36 Mile Gravel race in Cedar Springs, MI, on 13 July 2024. It was a fun little course with some nice fast roads, mild elevation changes, and a decent gravel/paved mix. Makes for a fast race.\nI overheated, and both legs cramped up completely by the end of the race, but I finished. \nthus was my first time here. I'll definitely be back next year.",
