      "transcript": "now it's early in the year but if you've\ngot a big ride plan for the summer Now's\nthe Time to be putting the miles in you\nknow running out of energy on a big ride\nin the middle of nowhere it's every\ncyclist worst nightmare some people call\nit the Bonk some people call it hitting\nthe wall I call it familiar but also\navoidable so in this video we're going\nto go through a bunch of tips to help\nyou get the best out of your big ride\nthis summer so you can smash those miles\nnow riding my bike a long way is my idea\nof fun and my big ride goals for the\nyear are the dragon ride at just over\n200k and also the 600k Brian Chapman\norox across Wales and back now those\nwill need very different strategies but\nthere are plenty of things that you\nshould always consider and whatever your\ngoal whether you're looking to complete\nuh a local spor an epic adventure a\nmulti-day ride your first 50k your first\n100K whatever hopefully we can impart\nsome knowledge to help you hit that goal\nand have you champing at the bit for\nyour next onike adventure don't go off\ntoo hard if you get nothing else from\nthis video just to remember that one\nthing it's so easy to get carried away\nat the start of a big ride you know\nwe've all done it I've done it many\ntimes and the last time I did the Brian\nChapman it meant I didn't even finish\nrun out of juice long before the end on\na big Ride Like the dragon ride you've\nonly got so many matches you can burn if\nyou boost up the hill in the Red Zone\nfirst off Straight Out The Gate that's\none gone you're never getting that back\npacing yourself will always mean going a\nlittle bit more slow slow than you think\nyou want to at the start but don't be\ntempted to push the pace until you know\nyou can hold it to the Finish or at\nleast until a break at a stop or\nsomething like that you'll probably have\na good idea of what kind of pace you can\nmaintain from training rides try and\nremember that and also remember just try\nand keep it chatty for the first hour if\nyou can't talk when you're riding that's\na really bad sign your body is the\nengine of your bike apart from when it\nruns out of fuel you'll just get laughed\nat if you up the AA cycling burns up\nbucket loads of energy so on a longer\nride you'll need to make sure you're\nreplacing it as much as you can you can\ndo this with cake this is one of my\nfavorite things about cycling now unless\nyou're racing you don't need to be too\nconcerned about exactly what it is\nyou're eating as long as it's got carbs\nin it then you know you're most of the\nway there it doesn't even have to be\ncycling specific I usually try to mix it\nup a bit unless you've got very firm\ncontrol over your guts then just gel\nnormally isn't the way to go experiment\nwith different foods and find out what\nworks for you and don't be tempted to\nGorge yourself on unfamiliar Sports\nNutrition products at the feed stops cuz\nthat can end badly if they don't agree\nwith you I speak from experience carb\ndrinks are an easy way to get some extra\nenergy down you as you hydrate and my\npersonal favorites are bananas and\nhomemade energy bars which are just a\nlittle of nuts and seeds and oats baked\nwith some syrup and cake and start\neating as soon as you set out by the\ntime you feel hungry you've already\nstarted on the bottomless spiral of pain\nit's not just your body that will be put\nunder strain on a big ride your bike\nwill as well and it's absolutely rubbish\nto have to throw in the towel due to\nsome avoidable mechanical when you're\nfeeling strong so make sure you can\nchange between and get into all your\ngears smoothly and if they're electronic\nthen make sure they're charged up make\nsure your chain is lubed uh to avoid any\nunwanted squeaking check you've got some\nbrake pads left check for thorns and\nglass in your tires pump those tires up\nand make sure they hold air many big\nrides will have some kind of bike\nsupport it might be tools and mechanics\nat the feed stops or even a neutral\nservice on the course don't rely on it\nthough take a tool kit with you make\nsure you know how to fix the things that\nare most likely to go wrong so loose\nbolts punctures gears going out of whack\nbrakes rubbing that kind of stuff now a\nlong ride can be ruined by discomfort\nbut what if I could tell you that you\ndon't have to suffer most knee and balm\nand back pain can be mitigated and I\ndon't mean by a cocktail of painkillers\nalthough I have been there I mean just\nby a well fitting bike now you don't\nneed to go and spend loads of money on a\nbike fit although a lot of people would\nbenefit from one just in case of making\nsmall changes to your setup seeing what\nworks for you for Comfort on those\nlonger rides now if you haven't seen it\nalready there's a great bike fitting\nvideo on our YouTube channel I'll link\nto that in the description below while\nyou're down there don't forget to\nsubscribe to Road CC for more great\ncycling videos like this one from\nus a lot of the hard work when\ncompleting a challenge happens long\nbefore you ever swing a leg over the\nbike on the start line there's lots of\nother things you can do to make your\nlife easier on the day firstly do some\nresearch if your big ride is an\norganized event how long does it take to\nget there and how much time will you\nneed to get yourself sorted before the\nstart is your route hilly or is it flat\nwhere are the hills how steep are they\nwhat gearing will you need to get up\nthem are there feed stations if so where\nare they and what can you expect to find\nthere if you don't ask yourself these\nquestions before the hour of Reckoning\nthen you could find yourself in a very\nsorry State I know I certainly have also\neat well the night before something\nfairly carb heavy to load up for ride is\ntraditional but whatever works for you\nand have a decent breakfast too\nobviously don't go crazy but there's no\npoint setting off with the tank half\nempty you'll also want to look at the\nweather for for the whole day if it's a\nlong ride dressing appropriately will\nmake your ride a lot more enjoyable and\nit's easy to get caught out did you know\nthat when you're riding on the road\nriding behind another Rider can save you\nabout a quarter of your effort now\nimagine what it's like if you're sitting\nbehind a whole bunch of people it's\ngreat more important than that though\nyou'll have somebody to talk to you'll\nhave somebody to share the experience\nwith you have somebody to sit with in\nthe pub afterwards that's one of the\nreason reasons people do a big Ride Like\nthe dragon ride for the sense of\ncamaraderie there's loads of people you\ncan ride with who'll be going the same\nspeed as you probably you've got some\nmates as well you can go with you can\nshare the driving and the experience\nwith them just remember that on a big\nride with hundreds thousands of people\nmaybe it's super easy to lose your ride\nbuddies one Hill they might go off the\nback then you'll never see them again\nit's a really good idea if you can to\nshare your location on your phone so\nthat you can see where everybody is you\ncan catch up with each other and ride\ntogether again you probably thought we'd\nforgotten about it but no there's no\ngetting around the fact that you'll get\nout what you put in if you're like me\nthen you'll think that you can cram\neverything into the last few weeks\nbefore an event and take it from my long\nexperience it's very very unlikely that\nthis will work your target event might\nseem like a long way off but it's never\ntoo early to start working towards it\ngetting some structure into your\ntraining will make all the difference\ncheck out our video on how to improve on\nthe bike there's a link in the\ndescription below one word of advice I\ndo have though is that don't feel you\nneed to have done the event distance\nbefore the day as long as you've done up\nto around 70% on a regular basis it's\npretty likely that with that training\nthey added adrenaline and motivation on\nthe day will get you over that final\nhurdle now we all know that bike riding\nis more than just about pushing the\npedals there's a fair amount of skill\ninvolved too and events such as spores\noften have lots of other people with\nwhat I shall charitably call various\ncompetencies to contend with as well as\nunpredictable conditions and unknown\nroads with this in mind it's probably a\ngood idea to brush up those skills now\nyou can find articles on how to properly\nclimb uh descend and Corner over on the\nroad CC website but there's other things\nyou can practice too for example getting\nbetter at riding on the wheel or\ndrinking and eating whilst riding along\nor if you're really confident putting on\nor taking off a jacket while you're\nriding so there you go those are our\ntips for your next big ride let us know\nyour big ride and what challenges you've\ngot planned in the comments below if any\nof you are doing the dragon ride in\nWales or the Brian Chapman then we'll\nsee you there if you like this content\nthen please give it a thumbs up\nsubscribe to the channel for lots more\nriding advice and if like me you're\nlooking to keep fit as the birth days\nkeep mounting up then why not check out\nour fit over 50 and 60 videos we'll see\nyou next time"
