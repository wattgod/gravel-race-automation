      "description": "Join me for onboard footage of the winning ride in the 2025 Chino Grinder gravel race. Chino Grinder is Arizona's longest-running gravel race, and at 107 miles and 8,400' of climbing, Chino is an attritional 5 hr+ race that is as much a test of one's will to keep pushing as it is a test of one's legs.\n\nThank-you to Spid Werkz Foundation for making this footage possible. Spid Werkz's mission is to support athletes from under-represented sports with gear, nutrition, and in-kind donations. If you like what you see here, please consider donating to Spid Werkz: https://spidwerkz.com/support/\n\nGear: For this race I'm on my Ventum GS1 gravel bike with 50mm Pirelli Cinturato M gravel tires. I had to do a little \"tire surgery\" and file off the side knobs of the rear tire to clear my frame, but the results speak for themselves. I used a 2L USWE hydration pack and two 20 oz bottles with Skratch ultra-high carb mix and NeverSecond energy gels,  targeting ~100g of carbohydrates per hour.",

      "transcript": "Welcome everyone to the 2025 Chino\nGrinder race recap video. This is my\nvery first time doing a YouTube video\nwith commentary, so please bear with me.\nUh, it could be pretty painful. We'll\nfind out. Um, definitely want to get\nyour feedback on what you think of this\nformat, whether you like this, whether\nyou have any\nsuggestions for improvements.\nUm, all kinds of feedback. Welcome.\nPlease leave some feedback in the\ncomments. I want to take a moment before\nwe get started here to recognize my one\nof my sponsors, Spids Foundation, who\nhave so graciously provided me with\nsupport this season, 2025. In fact, they\nprovided the GoPro that I used to record\nthis this uh race footage. So, let me\njust say that a little bit of support\nreally goes a long way for athletes like\nme. Spids is focused on supporting\nathletes from traditionally\nunderrepresented sports like cycling and\nrowing and their support has really been\ninstrumental for me this year in\nachieving all of my goals and staying on\ntop and I raise nutrition. So please, if\nyou like what you see, consider donating\nto Spids. I'm going to drop a link in\nthe video description. And with that,\nlet's get underway. So, here we're uh\njust in the neutral roll out. A little\nbit about the race. Uh Chino Grinder is\nArizona's longest running gravel race.\nUh I'm not sure exactly when they got\nstarted, but it was at least before\n2017. And uh here in the 2025 edition,\nthe course has been shortened ever so\nslightly from around 120 mi to about\n108.\nUm, we have the addition of a different\nuh out and back on the uh fire roads up\nnear Flagstaff, but the course is\nsubstantially the same. It's a it's just\none great big long out and back as you\ncan see from the map in the upper left\ncorner. And uh one of the really\ndefining features of this race is uh the\nlong HC road climb that uh comes right\nright in the middle of the race. So, uh,\nas it turns out, it didn't actually end\nup being very decisive, but, uh, we'll\nget to that when we get to that. So, it,\nuh, really quite cold at the start. You\ncan see here, we're uh, we've just hit\ndirt for the first time. Uh, the sun is\ncoming up over the mountains. We're at\nthe coldest part of the day. Uh, start\ntemperatures were a little below 40\u00b0 at\nthe start, so pretty nippy. But I'll\ntell you, things really warmed up pretty\nquick once we got moving and once the\nsun rose. And I, you know, at this point\nin the race, I was honestly really just\nenjoying these views over the mountains.\nI mean, look at that sunrise. Could you\nask for anything more? Um, the initial\nportion of this race was uh, you know,\npretty low gradient climbing. Really,\njust a lot of like 1 to 2%. Um, and the\nroads have recently been regraded. So,\nyou can see here I've uh I've actually\npushed up and over the high point. Uh I\nreally made a point out of making sure\nthat I was going to attack and be the\nfirst one up over the the first high\npoint so I could take the descent at my\nspeed uh with a clean line and with\nclean vision. I mean, one thing that\ndoesn't uh often get talked about in\ngravel races here is just how poor the\nvisibility can be. Um, particularly if\nit's dry and dusty like it was on this\nday, you get a lot of dust thrown up in\nthe air and then with the sunrise, it\ncan be very difficult to see. So, here I\nreally wanted to make sure that I was\nthe first one into the downhill and I\ncould really just focus on being, you\nknow, tucked in and aerodynamic and\ntaking whatever lines I wanted to\nthrough the corners. So, this portion is\nrelatively straight, non-technical. Um,\nI know that people are in my draft. I\nknow that they're getting a little bit\nof a benefit from it, but the truth of\nthe matter is it's uh I I feel a lot\nbetter to just be safe and to be in the\nfront in situations like that,\nespecially when there's still a lot of\npeople around. Um and this descent, you\nknow, it's not just a straight descent.\nThere's a few kickers like this. And I I\nreally like to make a point out of\npushing hard up and over each one of\nthese and really trying to maintain that\nspeed so that once I get up and over the\ntop, boom, just right back into an arrow\nposition and picking up as much steam as\npossible. Um really I I had a coach and\na mentor who used to drill into me that\nspeed is king and it's all about\nmaintaining a constant high speed. You\ncan see here uh Justin Rea. This is a\npro triathlete and um he ended up second\non the day. Not to spoil things for\npeople, but uh you'll see him again a\nlot as we as we move through this race.\nJustin was super duper strong all day\nlong. And uh you know, he I was really\nworried that uh I I wasn't going to be\nable to deal with him. You can see he's\ngot me on a good gap here. And I'm I'm\nnot freaking out too much, but I'm I'm\npushing a little bit. I want to make\nsure that I keep him close. There's\nthere's just no reason to let a gap open\nhere. It's just a straight non-technical\ndescent. So, I'm going to reel them in\nnice and easy, just in the saddle,\nfocused on smooth pedal strokes and\npower. And before we know it, we're\nright back on the wheel.\nNow, at this point, we're headed towards\nsome more technical switchbacks on the\ndescent. So, I really want to make sure\nthat I stay up at the front for this so\nthat I can really take those on my own\nterms. So, here we go. We're getting\ninto the uh the more technical portion\nof the first descent. And uh again, I've\nI've really made sure that I stayed like\nsecond or third wheel and that um I've\ngot my map screen up so I can see when\nthe turns are approaching. And I mean, I\nthink that that's really important,\nbeing able to use the different screens\nand the data that's available to you to\nplan and make tactical maneuvers. So\nhere I've I pushed to be at the front\nand we're making our way through the\nfirst of uh two switchbacks. This one is\nuh actually relatively mellow. It's more\nof a double switch back. As you can see,\nthis is the the second aid station on\ncourse and um the second to last one on\nthe way back. But as we come around the\ncorner here, um there's going to be like\na straight fast descent and then a\ntighter, more technical switch back at\nthe bottom. So here I'm just I'm keeping\non the steam. I don't want anyone to\nroll over the top of me here. I really\nwant to keep front wheel the whole way\nthrough here until we get to the bottom\nand then we'll regroup. So you know at\nthis point it's less about the power and\nmore just about positioning and staying\nfocused on um being smooth, being\nrelaxed and being aerodynamic.\nSo here we go rolling towards the second\nswitch back. Uh you can see the road has\nrecently been regraded and it's actually\nin pretty good condition. So apart from\nsome washboards, it's not bad. But here\nI really try to take this corner at at\nmaximum speed. I aim for the inside of\nthe apex of the corner and try to\nmaintain straight line as possible and\nthen really up onto the pedals out of\nthe saddle. Focused on getting back up\nto speed as quickly as I can through\nthere.\nNow\num at this point, you know, we're we're\nwe're nearly to the bottom. I know\nthere's going to be a regrouping. I know\nthat a lot of people are behind me, but\nthey're they're not getting much of a\nbenefit from me drafting me at this\npoint, right? There's there's uh a lot\nof gaps opening up behind us. So, here\nwe go. Fast forward to the top of the\nroad climb. I'll spare you all the\ntedious details. Like, frankly, it was\npretty neutral most of the way up, but\nJustin, he was just so so so strong on\nthis whole climb. And honestly, if he\nhadn't uh dropped his base layer into\nhis chain and gotten it tangled up and\nhad to spend a I don't know, a minute,\ntwo minutes fishing it out, oh, he could\nhave done some real real damage to us\nall here. As it was, he he pulled back\nthat gap all on his own. Went straight\nto the front. And you can see here, he's\nout of the saddle, putting us all under\npressure. And I'm going to be honest,\nthis was one of the one of the moments\nuh during the race where I felt like I\nwas under the most pressure. I know\nwe're near the high point, so I can just\nreally focus on holding that wheel. Dig\ndeep, get out of the saddle, do whatever\nit takes. Don't let him get away from\nme, cuz I know I'm going to get some\nrecovery soon. And really, in moments\nlike that, you know, you got to just\nkind of keep the faith and just think,\noh, if I can make it another 10 seconds,\nif I can make it another 15 seconds,\nthen things are going to get better. I'm\ngoing to be able to recover. And sure\nenough, you know, as we begin to roll\nover the top, it's going to flatten out\nand I'm going to start getting a much\ngreater draft benefit from being able to\nsit on Justin's wheel. But he was uh he\nhe really had a lot of gas left in the\ntank at this point. So, very impressive\nstuff.\nNow, uh, at this point, you know, we're\ngoing to we're going to begin descending\non the new outback portion that, uh,\nthat goes down into, uh, the turnaround\npoint at 54 miles. And, uh, this is\naround the time I started realizing that\nI was having some mechanical problems.\nSo, you can see here, Justin is, you\nknow, maybe not quite as confident as I\nam, uh, going through these corners.\nI've really put in a lot of work this\nyear um to improve my gravel descending.\nIt's I've I've put in a lot of work on\ndescents like Mount Hopkins and I've\nbeen doing a lot of mountain bike racing\ntoo and I really feel like it's paying\noff. You can see especially through this\ncorner, Justin kind of runs a little bit\nwide while I make sure I stay very far\ninside so I can ride the banked surface\nof the road where it drains off to the\nright and I can carry so much more speed\nthrough there and with a lot more\nconfidence.\nNow, all that's great, but\nconfidence is about to run out once I\nrealize that um I'm having some brake\nproblems. Uh so, uh you know, I'm on\nhydraulic brakes, as pretty much\neveryone is here in the 21st century. I\nstore my bikes on a rack standing\nvertically, and in order to get them all\nfit, I got to store some of them\nbasically upside down with the handle\nbars pointed towards the ground. The\ngravel bike is one of them. As it turns\nout, that can sometimes have some\neffects on uh where bubbles, if there\nare any, in your hydraulic brake system\ngo. And uh as we'll see here at this\nhair pin at the bottom, um I had\nbasically lost all of my front brake.\nAnd I start to realize and so I'm\npulling the rear and I'm skipping a\nlittle bit. I'm just trying not to lose\ncomposure, not to uncip. I run wide off\nthe side of the road, but you know, just\nkind of staying focused and and trying\nto stay cool and calm, managed to keep\nit up and not take anyone to the ground\nwith me. So, thank goodness that wasn't\nthe only time that happened in this\nrace.\nNow, at this point, we've made it back\nto the road. Uh we've climbed up and out\nof Matan and Maxwell Ry. So, Matan Suler\nis one of my one of my teammates. He was\nin the neon green Landis Trek jersey.\nUm, and Maxwell Ry, another very\ntalented Catwoman cyclist who's just\nmoved to Arizona. Uh, they've been\ndropped. So, it's just me and Justin Rea\nat this point. And I'm pretty thankful\nto have a a companion for this descent,\nespecially kind of a a stockier, more\npowerful rider like uh like Justin who\ncan really uh plow through the wind and\nand give me a nice draft down a long\ndescent like this. But I'll say that\neven even now on this descent where\nwe're doing 40 m hour and we're not\npedaling. I was beginning to have some\ninklings that, you know, Justin might be\nstarting to feel the efforts a bit. He\nhe uh was again, I cannot emphasize\nenough, just so strong all day long. Um,\nbut he ended up stopping a couple of\ntimes. uh once for the for the clothing\nsnafu and a second time to take a\nhydration pack at the aid station where\nI decided I'm going to take two big\nbottles. I'm going to take 2 lers of\nwater in my hydration pack. I'm going to\ntake that weight penalty and I'm going\nto make sure I don't have to stop a\nsingle time in this entire race. And I\ncan see even on this descent, he's\nstarting to, you know, not really pull\nvery hard as we're as we're going down.\nSo, um, now we're we're making our way\nback onto the dirt and, uh,\nthis is where, uh, some of the real\ntells start to show. So, as we as we\nbegin making our way, um, onto the dirt,\nwe we kind of pass through a sector with\nsome some rolling punchy climbs uh,\nbefore we do a slightly technical\ndescent back to the low point of the\ncourse. And um as we'll see here shortly\nuh on some of these short kickers, you\nknow, I'm really I'm really\nfocused on keeping the speed high. So\nhere we go. We're doing like 32 mph\nhere. Still going downhill a little bit,\nbut boom. About to hit one of the\nsteepest kickers on course. It's not\nvery much to look at here, but you know,\nyou got to keep in mind we're about\nthree and a half hours into the race.\nIt's been hard. So, here we go. Up out\nof the saddle. You can see instantly I'm\nalready up in front of Justin's wheel.\nYou know, he's uh he's he's still\nstaying with it. He's make no mistake,\nhe latches right onto my wheel after\nthis. But this is just kind of goes to\nshow that like yeah, if Justin was\nfeeling great, if he was feeling like he\ncould, you know, work me over later on\nin this race, there's probably no way he\nlets me get in front of him at this\npoint. So, up and over the top. Make\nsure we get back up to speed.\nUnfortunately, I didn't have the GoPro\nrunning during the uh descent down to\nPerkinsville. But here we go. This is\nthe final climb out from Perkinsville up\nto the last high point before the final\n10 miles, which are basically all\ndownhill. At this point, I've managed to\ndrop Justin. I'm driving the dagger in.\nI've basically just surged one time too\nmany for him. We're at hour about four\nhours 15 minutes. It's been really,\nreally hard all day long. And here I'm\nreally surprised at how good I was still\nfeeling. I knew that at this point, you\nknow, I've got the separation. I need to\nkeep staying on the gas. I got to really\ndrive this whole thing home. And you\nknow, I I remember early on when I was\nlearning how to race road bikes, someone\ntold me, you know, once you got a gap,\nyou really got to just basically step on\ntheir neck. You know, don't let them up\nfor air. Bury them 6 ft deep. And\nespecially knowing that the last 10\nmiles is kind of a false flat downhill\nthat's much better suited to uh like a\nsteady power guy like Justin, you know,\nkind of stockier, bigger guy who's going\nto roll really fast down that. I know I\nneed to pat out my advantage as much as\nI possibly can here on the uphill. So,\nI'm all in 100% full gas. And let me\ntell you, I was pretty empty by the time\nwe hit the high point. But from there,\nit was just all about staying focused,\nstaying arrow, and making my way to the\nfinish and finally being able to lift my\narms in celebration of being the first\nfinisher of the 108 mile long course at\nChino Grinder. So really, I just want to\nsay once again, thank you Spids for your\nsupport throughout this entire season,\nand thank you to each and every one of\nyou who decided to tune in and watch\nthis whole video recap. Really enjoyed\nit. Hoping I can bring some more footage\nto you again soon from Spirit World in\nPatagonia."

      "transcript": "So, this is super flattering with my\nglariness, but\nI made it up to Chino Valley and I'm in\nmy car\nand I'm in my sleeping bag and I'm about\nto watch a movie and do some knitting\nand I have donuts\nand electrolytes.\nSo, I'm quite excited. Oh, and a\nheadlamp\nand other protective measures and\nthings. So, I'm excited to do this.\nYep. This is the thing that I'm doing.\nCar camping.\nThis is me at like 11:00 at night inside\nthe toilet block. Going to do my final\nwee and then go to bed. I'm so excited.\nIt is 11:04 p.m. That sounded really\nweird. on Friday night. I was watching\nyour movie,\nbut um the player died. So now I'm not\nwatching a movie. Um I did cast on my\nsocks with the yarn that I bought at\nyarn parlor a couple weeks ago. I had a\nbagel\nwith some Marmite on it. Um I've drank\nalmost the whole power. I just went\nuntinkled.\nUm, so got an alarm set for 6:00. The\ncoffee truck opens at 5:00. I have no\ndesire to be up that early.\nBut yeah, walked in and\ntired. And so now I'm going to try and\ncar camp for the first time and get good\nnight's sleep, which would be lovely\nconsidering I've not been able to sleep\nwell for like the last three nights. So\nyeah, next time I record something, it\nwill be morning time. Really hoping I\nget a good night's sleep. Don't get too\ncold. But it's quite cozy in here. My\nchild size sleeping bag.\nIt is now 7 o'clock in the morning. I\nhave registered. I've got my uh tag on\nmy bike. I have coffee. Well, I already\nregistered, but now I picked up my\npacket. And yeah, I've got the car going\nfor a minute. I look rough. So that I\ncan charge my phone a little bit and\nhave a little bit of heat. I'm about to\neat my bagel and then I'm gonna get my\nbike ready and I'm gonna get me ready.\nYeah. Um at 7. We line up around 8 and\nthen start at 8:15. Super excited. Slept\ndecent last night. No worse than I did\nat home. And yeah, there will be more\nupdates\nto get everybody up in that front spot.\nThere you go. Get\nall in this together.\noh\nObama.\nThat was rough.\nHeat. Heat.\nHallelujah.\nfar back.\nFar back.\nOkay. drafting behind her.\nOh, I look cute.\nThat's not cute. Look at all. But\nlet's look at the swag.\nOh, I'm recording.\nSo, I'm done. I got done a while ago. I\nate some donuts. Uh, it went well. Did\nnot finish my banana.\nLet's look at the swag.\nWe've got some\nChino grinder socks.\nShendo cap racing socks.\nThose are cool. Man, I smell terrible.\nUm, I got some nut butter for my bum\nbum.\nSome chain lube.\nMoxy hydration.\nA water bottle.\nsome advertisements.\nThis I think is a tool kit. So, let's\nlook at that.\nMy hands are sore.\nSo, I guess you put like a tube and\nstuff like that.\nOh, it's so cute. Then you can strap it\nto your bike.\nI'm closing it wrong. No. Yes. I don't\nknow. Oh,\nyeah. Stretch one to your bike\nsomewhere. I'm too tired.\nAnd a t-shirt, which I will wear\nobnoxiously the next day. I think I'll\nwear it tonight actually when I go watch\nthe fights. Um, so yeah, it's done. It's\n10:40.\nThe the rewards the the reward was in\nthe project. The awards are at one. So,\nI think I am going to\npack up.\nNot sure if I'm going to shower here or\nshower at home.\nUm, but I'm going to pack up and then I\nwill go and get something to eat cuz\nI've eaten lots of carbs.\nLots of sugary carbs. Well, okay. Only\nthe donuts were the sugary carbs and the\nbanana. But I need to um\nI need to\nfinish my sentence. I need to I want to\ngo in and sit down. Oh. Oh, coffee. I\nwant more coffee. So, I only have one\ncup of coffee. It's right here. But this\nis a blast. I definitely want to do it\nagain. I think the 20ish mile one was\nthe perfect distance for me. Uh, I\nunderstand the appeal of investing in a\nrube bike now cuz my hands, oh my god.\nThings that I did well for this include\nhow I carve bloated, how I hydrated.\nThat was fine. I probably maybe\noverhydrated because I stopped and peed\nat the halfway point, but I'm also\nmenrating, so thought that that'd be a\ngood idea just to check in. Um, so that\nwas good. The sleep was good. I got six\nalmost seven hours sleep, a couple\ninterruptions, but then what I do that\nwhen then when the four-year-old gets in\nbed with me, um, I had enough time to\nprepare the water pack. I don't know why\nwith camel black I'm just I can't figure\nout how to screw it on properly. Um and\nso that was interesting because when I\nwas going uphill it weighed down. It\nfelt I felt like it was weighing me down\ncuz I'm a decent I'm a really good\nclimber and it was like the water. I\ncould feel it with the gravity and I'm\nlike oh this isn't fun. So that could\nhave been better. Um, I have my cheapy\nAmazon shammy on, my shammy shorts, and\nI have lost weight.\nI'm actually probably about the same\nsize as I was when I started cycling\npre-marriage, but um, they're so baggy\nbecause my body composition is\ncompletely different now. And so I kept\ngetting\nuh the shammy was just as a woman we\nthere's a place like we want the shammy\nto come forward and it and it started\nright where\nmy underc carriage touches the front of\nmy seat and so it's it was just slightly\nshy of that and that was not\ncomfortable. It's not comfortable right\nnow. I feel like I need to like pull\nthem up which obviously you can't do\nthat while you're cycling. So, I need to\ninvest in some tighter shorts and some\nwith their shammy comes up further to\nthe front. Um,\nuse my standard uh mountain bike shorts.\nThose were from Pearl Zooi. Those worked\nreally well. Um, got my We sell running\nshirt. I liked having that. Uh, I didn't\nhave the glove st.\nBut it was nice getting to see my watch\nwithout pulling things. And then I wore\nmy over jacket so I had like the pocket\naccess. It's not that I really used it\nfor anything, but it was nice feeling\nthat. Um,\nI had to stop\nabout 3/4 of the way into the race and\nactually just adjust my shoe. Um,\nbecause it was like that my right shoe.\nI like them to be like weirdly tight,\nbut I could tell it's cutting into\ncirculation and it's going to give me a\nblister. So, I stopped. I used um my\nsocks that my daughter's dad got me a\ncouple years ago and I love that it's\ngot like the front pulley bit, the extra\ncushioning. So sometimes with cycling\nshoes I have the issue where they cut\ninto my foot too much. So I really like\nhaving that extra padding in the front\num on my sock.\nUh helmet was a helmet. I use my cycling\ncap. These gloves are destroyed. like\nthey they probably be okay now for road,\nbut I definitely need more padding.\nI want padding in the actual fingers. Um\nand the palm the shock absorption I\nthink is gone in those. Um I did get\na Rock Bros bag to go for this and um I\nlike having my phone right there even\nthough I didn't use my phone at all. And\nI actually have a blister on my left\nknee from hitting it when I was cycling.\nSo, I did not love that. And I felt like\nI had to like keep my legs open wider\nthan what I'd like to. I do want to clip\nin the next time I do a gravel race. Um\nbecause I think I I don't know if I\nwould have gone any faster, but there\nthere was one point when I was like\ngoing downhill and pedaling. I had\ndecent speed and my feet came like I my\nfeet came off the actual pedals and I\nwas like So did not like that.\nThat was kind of scary.\nAwkward.\nBut yeah, I had a lot of fun.\nAnd now I'm going to pack up all my\nstuff. Oh, also this is like an exciting\nthing. So, I got this at a consignment\nstore a couple weeks ago, and I was\nlike, I don't know if I'm ever going to\nactually use this, but it's like this\nnice Burton uh\nthing thing coat, and it was perfect for\nsleeping in last night. At one point, it\nwas like rubbing on me, so I zipped it\nall the way up and tucked my chin in,\nand I felt all nice and cozy. Um, so I\nlike that. Most of the stuff I got for\nthis I didn't I either already had or I\npurchased used. I got these from Harbor\nFreight for like $2. They were perfect\nfor uh the light situation last night.\nSo, yeah, there's a flashlight option or\nthat. And those were perfect.\nThat was fun. So, I'll take a little bit\nof footage out there. Um after the\nawards, I'm going to head to a yarn shop\ncalled Fiber Creek LLC.\nAnd yeah, so I guess now I'll pack up.\nOh, and then my camera died probably\nabout twothirds of the way in, which I\ntook video and that was just good to do\nit to see like how much video it takes.\nSo, yeah, pretty pleased with how things\nwent all in and curious to see how my\nresults are, but I did it just to\ncomplete it. So, yeah, I'm happy.\nThank you."
