      "description": "Threading the needle to avoid a massive crash to get to the finish line. Not the race I wanted, but considering the alternative I'll take it.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Hey! SUBSCRIBE for more race content! \ud83d\udc49 https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsr-SU_SAqjrzmu4kXIRfUQ?sub_confirmation=1\n\nThe Barry Roubaix was held on April 12, 2025 in Hastings, MI. I raced the 62 mile version (actually almost 65 miles) which had around 4,800 ft of climbing. Temperature was decent, in the lower 50s with full sun and no wind. I saw the staging coral already starting to fill up 40 minutes before the start so I had to cut my warmup short and get in line around 50th. I tried to move up once the race started but kept getting shuffled back. The 3 sisters felt ok and I was trying to monitor my effort and not burn any unnecessary matches. However, that strategy left me further back in the pack then I wanted.\n\nJust after 4 miles in on a seemingly uneventful section of the course, all hell broke loose. At nearly 30 mph the group started to suddenly slow down. Little did I know there was a crash on the left that would cause a cascade of overreactions and eventual crashes everywhere. Applying my brakes I noticed I wasn't slowing down fast enough. I swerved out of the way of the first few riders attempting to stop then all I saw and heard was crashing all around me. Time slowed down and all I thought was to steer through it rather than attempting to stop. I remember running over something on my left and something hitting my arm/shoulder on my right. The next thing I knew is that I was through the chaos. Crash can be seen in more detail here:   https://youtu.be/DG557fyV0YY?si=i9C2Dw_EolsY95Yk\n\nI somehow made it through the crash unscathed but lost the front group of about 50+ riders. Not ideal but better than being in a nasty crash. A small group of us chased back for 6 miles (15 minutes) until we reached the front group just in time for Shaw road. Well, that was too much and I completely blew up. I struggled for the next hour until I latched onto a group after the Farm around mile 30. After mile 48 our group caught another group of about 20 and we swelled to nearly a 50 rider peloton. This massive group stayed together until the final mile into the finish. I didn't have much in legs at the end but was able to work myself into finishing 7th in the group sprint (though we were all together and got the same time). Somehow I got a Strava crown for 10th best ever sprint in that section which I will be taking as a moral victory, lol.  I ended up 73rd overall which was a PR but shy of my goal of top 50. \n\n\ud83d\udc49 Hey!

The start list at the 2024 edition of Unbound Gravel was the highest caliber field ever seen at this race, including the current UCI Gravel World Champion, several current UCI World Tour athletes, a majority of the LifeTime Grand Prix Athletes, former Paris-Roubaix winners and a whole lot of properly fast folks.\n\nMy goal for this race was to have a clean race, and conserve as much energy in the first 100 miles so that I could stay on the power for the latter half of the race, when other athletes would start to fall apart with the duration and rising temps. The race started insanely fast, more reminiscent of a 100 mile road race than a 9+ hour gravel race. I was very cautious in the first few hours, and unfortunately found myself chasing back on to the lead group several times as riders were flatting, crashing and cracking just a few wheels ahead of me in the first few decisive sections.\n\nThe lead group came into Aid Station 1 with ~60 riders, and unfortunately I panicked a bit coming out of the first Aid stop and burnt a match too many - I came off of the lead group here, but sat up for a few minutes to regather myself and get ready for the next 5+ hours of steady chasing. I quickly fell in with a chase group after Aid 1, and we were picking off riders almost immediately. Not long after the notorious Little Egypt, Andrew Dillman and I were able to pick up Truman Glasgow and Konny Looser, and the 4 of us were able to catch a group including Niki Terpstra, Laurens ten Dam, Thomas Dekker, Tobin Ortinblad, Rob Britton and several other fast folks. This new chase group of ~12 riders rotated well and smooth, and we were picking off riders through the latter part of the race that is mostly tame gravel with a few climbs.\n\nUnfortunately, with around 40km of racing left on a descent, the two riders in front of me hit a rock, and was unable to avoid hitting this rock at ~45kph, causing a flat for all three of us. I was able to ride for a short while before I had to inflate the tire again, but I didn't jostle the sealant around and had to stop to inflate the tire two more times. The third time I had to stop, with around 30km of racing left, I was unable to regain contact with this chase group and rode solo until the last 3km.\n\nThe next chase group on the road caught me right before the final few turns and final climb (a hill on a normal day, but a brutal punch after nearly 325km of racing). The original chase group I was in raced for 40th, and this second chase I finished in sprinted for 52nd. I was second in this sprint, finishing 53rd on the day.\n\nOverall, I am happy to see that I have the strength and race acumen to be racing with the big dawgs, but I am quite a bit bummed to miss out on finishing with the group racing for 40th due to a relatively silly mechanical. Unbound is a beast, and I will definitely be back for a shot at redemption!\n\nFollow me at\n:http://youtube.com/justinmcquerryhttp\n://instagram.com/j_mcquerry/http\n://strava.com/athletes/justinmcquerryhttp\n://facebook.com/justin.mcquerry/\n\n0:00 Start\n4:28 Gravel\n1:13:00 Gun Barrel Hill\n1:47:37 Eskridge To Alma\n3:14:42 Aid Station 1\n3:17:01 Chase After Alma\n3:47:05 Chase Group 1\n4:47:00 Dillman & McQuerry\n5:30:55 Water Oasis 1\n6:41:00 Chase Group 2\n7:16:08 Aid Station 2\n7:26:35 Chase After Council Grove\n8:26:48 Flat\n9:03:39 Solo\n9:38:58 Finish",
