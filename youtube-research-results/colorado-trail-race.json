      "description": "Not all videos of bike packing the Colorado Trail end in a joyful finish. Three months out from my last radiation treatment for neck and oral cancer I under took bike packing the Colorado Trail from Durango to Denver (that's the hard way). The bicycle has always been an important part of my life, but in 2020 with a cancer diagnosis and COVID19 it has been so much more-- a life life, a motivational tool and a way to remind myself of the simple joys of life. This video gives you a brief snapshot of the beauty and the harshness of  bike packing the CT. \n\nIf you like that snazzy sun hat bike helmet combo I have on in the vide check out DaBrim http://www.dabrim.com/index.html \nIn looking for a way to keep the sun off my freshly radiated and sun sensitive face and neck, I found this hat better than any sunscreen. \n\nI started Bikes Kill Cancer as an Instagram account in 2020 to keep friends and family looped in on my cancer journey. In six short months, it has become so much more. I've used Bikes Kill Cancer as a catalyst for raising over $6000 for cancer and COVID research, a place to post bicycle and cancer related videos and hopefully as a way to share the joys of riding bicycles and being outside. \n\nFollow me on Instagram- https://www.instagram.com/bikeskillcancer/\nBlog- https://bikeskillcancer.art.blog",

the\nColorado Trail and that is all going to\nchange right after I pack all this crap\non my bike and speaking of my bike here\nit is it's a hardtail mountain bike with\nfront suspension we've got 110 mm up\nhere I actually designed this bicycle\nwith my friends at priority it is called\nthe 600x and it is a low maintenance\nAdventure machine what makes it really\nspecial is right down here this is\ncalled the pinion gearbox all of the\ngears are enclosed and protected from\nthe elements attached to that is the\ngates carbon belt drive it's not a\ntypical chain this thing never needs to\nbe lubed and it lasts three times longer\nthan a regular chain that is my baby\nright there and oh yeah we've got a\ndropper post for the technical stuff\nokay it's all packed up the next trick\nis getting a heavy\nbike down my stairs there we go this is\ngoing to be be What It's Like on the\ncallado trail up and down steep sections\nhike a\nbike goodbye beautiful\n[Music]\nBoulder and yes I'm A 42-year-old man\nthat has his mom drive him\naround how do you feel about that Mom\nI'm used to\nit all right there it is the official\nstart durang goes that way I love you so\nmuch love you too you be really safe\nokay love love love that'll be the theme\nof The Ride double\n[Applause]\nlove oh perfect it is so hot oh this\nwater feels amazing\nit was nice to cool off but\nboy this is tough there's no doubt about\nit\njungle going through the Colorado jungle\nhere\nokay I'm so excited to be here and\ngrateful\nto be on this Trail and I'm just so glad\nthat this Trail exists an hour from my\nhouse all right I stopped because I want\nto show you something I've climbed about\n2300 ft my elevation is about 7500 ft\nand I'm getting to the top of the trees\nand I have some views look at this look\nat that beautiful mountain across the\nway that is pretty sweet\ndo do do do do\nthere's the Plat\nRiver pretty cool I've been sucking down\nwater because it's so hot today so time\nto filter with my stere\npen\nwoo and that is how you cool off on a\nhot summer day\npedal pedal pedal that's been my\nMantra ever since I started riding bikes\neven when it's hard just pedal even if\nyou're going super duper slow you're\nmoving forward and then sometimes\nwalking is the best option and that's\nokay too but man it's a little easier to\nPedal when it's so beautiful everybody\ntold me how stunning this ride would be\nand it's already stunning and this isn't\neven supposed to be the spectacular\npart I love my state\nsh\nand there it is my Camp spot for the\nnight looks nice and\nflat what a day and I think I'm\nfinishing just in time there's a little\nbit of\nThunder happening right now I went 28\nmiles I feel pretty good about that\nlittle half day action it is 7:30 p.m.\nit's Friday night you know big things\nare going to happen tonight like\nsleeping I'm a little bit tired but what\na great first\nday day one Colorado Trail in the books\nwenas noes\nthank you a beautiful piece of flat\nground to sleep on time to go that\nway all right the Sun is shining there\nare no clouds in the sky it's nice and\nwarm but I think it's going to be cooler\ntoday overall it's going to be an\nawesome Saturday Sabo\nhigante sometimes you just got to stop\nand admire the flowers and this is a\ngood one it makes me very happy it's the\nColine the Colorado state flower and it\nalways reminds me of my mom it's her\nfavorite flower and she has them all\nover her garden at\nhome and it makes me really happy\nknowing that I get to ride this\nbeautiful Trail for another 10 days or\nso\nthat's an overload of beauty we're going\nto see if I can handle it I think I can\nbut\nwow I'm feeling very fortunate\nso besides having the GPS downloaded to\nmy Wahoo which gives me turn for turn\ndirections I also have it on my phone in\nan app called gut hook and it's really\ncool because it has all these landmarks\non the app and you can just touch\nsomething and it says seasonal stream\nand then hikers can go by and leave\ncomments to say if it's you know still\nlegit or not moderate flow filled water\nhere and it gives the date so that you\nknow that you might have some good water\nsources coming up it's pretty cool I'm\nimpressed with all this technology these\ndays so I've seen a ton of hikers out\nhere way more hikers than bikers and I\njust ran into this nice guy named Stan\nwho's done the Colorado Trail five times\nwhat inspires you to do this uh well I\ndrive a truck for a living and every two\nor three years I get like 30 pounds\noverweight and I come out here for diet\nand exercise\nand it\nworks so I I come out here my first year\nand I met all these nice mountain bikers\nand they're really great people and uh I\ndecided I wanted to do that so I went\nhome and I spent a lot of money and I\nbought a Gary Fisher 29er and then I\nrode it a little bit in Iowa and I\nrealized I would die in Colorado I would\nliterally go off the side of the trail\nso now I've got a Gary Fisher 29er\nstored in my upstairs bedroom that's\nonly been rode about 40 miles so I stick\nto hiking well I wish you all the best\nit was great to meet you was nice\nmeeting you too cheers\nbam so bikes can't ride on all of the\nColorado Trail there are six Wilderness\nareas where you have to go around it and\nso I'm on the first one the Lost Creek\nWilderness bypass and it's a nice dirt\nroad I don't know exactly how long it is\nbut I think it's fairly\nlong so at least it's chill no cars on\nyet but I already miss that beautiful\nsingle track\nso what I'm loving so far about this\nTrail is that there's water all over the\nplace so I don't have to carry a ton\nwhich makes my my bike load lighter and\nso usually I get to a little stream fill\nup the bottle filter it chug a bottle\nand then fill fill up another one for\nthe road\nyou know I can't pass this up oh that\nfeels so\ngood\nyes\nwoo today's stream is a lot colder than\nyesterday's but it feels so good it's\nanother hot day it's like my computer\nsays 90\u00b0\nI was\ntoo yeah back to and now it's time for\nthe main event we've got pizza and I am\nso

camp together\nright yeah I like it all right we're\nriding with the crew now the wolf pack\nW I don't think we could have asked for\na better Camp spot I Can't Believe It's\nNot Taken uh but what a wonderful end to\nthe day yes man it was a tough day I\nrode 74 miles with 8,000 ft of elevation\ngain that's a lot and I'm going to have\nto get used to that cuz that's probably\ngoing to be my daily average 8 to 10,000\nft of elevation gain it's going to be\nfun to hang out with these guys tonight\nand just uh chat you know it's been a\nlong time since I've hung out with uh\n17-year-olds all

because there's a lot of veterans\non them a lot of young kids with holes\nin their heart that are looking for\ndirection and I just come out to\nencourage them because if I can do this\nin my old age

oh\nbuddy well here I am another day on the\nColorado Trail 3/4 of today was really\nhard for me I just wasn't in my groove I\nthink it might have to do with waking up\nreally early and it was super cold like\nthe first hour and a half of riding my\nfingers were numb and I was just\nuncomfortable when I'm cold I just I\njust don't feel right I like warm\nweather I was having a hard\ntime just uh enjoying it and that that\nkind of makes me sad it's like I'm I'm\nout here to enjoy the moment and really\nlove this but it's so hard it's so damn\nhard can you believe I only rode 41\nmiles today and I started at 6:50 a.m.\nand ended at 7:50 so 13 hours on the\nbike and 40 miles 7,000 ft of elevation\nbang so needless to say I'm very excited\nto sleep and do it again tomorrow wait\nus no\nI

very\nnice I sometimes wish I could read the\nfuture at least the very near future if\nthat were the case I would not have\njumped in freezing cold water 20 minutes\nago\nso I heard quite a Ruckus

      "transcript": "hey everyone neil belchenko here and\nmany of you last week\nasked me to unpack the winning rig of\nthe colorado trail race\nand so here it is last week i ended up\nfinishing the colorado trail\nin four days and three hours roughly so\nin this video we're going to talk about\nthe bike the components the bags what's\nin each bag and you even asked me a few\nquestions last week\nso i'm going to answer those questions\nfor you as well let's do it\nso please bear with me because my voice\nis still not a hundred percent after\nhuffing and puffing for four straight\ndays but we're getting there\nother than that i'm feeling pretty good\num i've got a little bit of hand\nnumbness which is pretty typical\nbut uh other than that and muscle\nfatigue we're good\nso just to share a little bit of context\nhere for the colorado trail\nin 2012 i did the colorado trail in 10\ndays\nwith a friend and it was actually our\nfirst bike packing trip so it was a\npretty big\nundertaking for our first bike packing\ntrip but in the end it was an\nincredible experience it not only\nshowcased what us as humans can do\non a bike which is pretty awesome but it\nalso showcased\nwhat these bikes can handle through\npretty rough terrain\nso in 2013 i participated in my first\ncolorado trail race\nand that was the first colorado trail\nrace from durango to denver similar to\nthis year\ni ended up finishing in four days in 21\nhours\nand it was just such an amazing\nexperience and i was hooked so the next\nyear i ended up coming back and that was\nand that race started in denver and went\nto durango and i ended up winning that\nrace\nuh in four days nine hours and 55\nminutes\nand i ended up actually dealing with\nquite a few injuries specifically a\noverused knee injury that year\nso it wasn't a clean run but it was a\nreally eye-opening experience\nso i skipped a year and came back in\nand this was the year that i actually\nset a course record on the route but it\nstarted pretty interesting i started\nwith a group\nand 25 miles in or so i ended up\nbreaking my shifter because i plopped my\nbike over on a rock and it kind of\nexploded in front of me it was a really\ncrazy experience what i ended up doing\nwas going back down to denver going to\npedal a littleton swapping out a shifter\nand starting basically 24 hours\nafter the race start and what that is\ncalled is an\nindividual time trial and anybody can\nindividually time trial the route\nwhenever they want\ni ended up finishing that itt in three\ndays 19 hours and 50 minutes\nand that set a new course record on the\ncolorado trail\nand that course record still holds today\nso after taking five years off the route\ni was like all right i think it's time\nto get back out on the colorado trail\nso that's what i did this year and it\nwent really well it started in durango\nthis year and went to denver\nand well it started really really wet\nbut we'll get into that in the question\nand answer let's\njust dive right into the bike all right\nso the bike itself the frame this is a\nsalsa\nspearfish this is a 2020 salsa spearfish\nthis is the medium size i'm roughly five\nnine and a half or so\nso i probably could fit a large but i\nwent with the medium because well it\njust\nallows me to kind of maneuver the bike a\nlittle bit more but it's also a little\nbit lighter\nand it has a narrower wheelbase the bike\nhas a 68 degree head tube angle 432\nmillimeter chain\nstays and overall a 1 163 millimeter\nwheelbase this bike is great because it\nis still a cross country bike but\nit has a little bit more of those trail\ncharacteristics that you're seeking\nespecially on the rough colorado trail\nthe other benefit of this bike obviously\nis that frame bag space and we'll get\ninto that in a second but it's\ndefinitely a large space to fit a custom\nframe bag so that you can store a lot of\ncargo in that frame\nand then as far as this rear shock it's\njust a float dps\nperformance works really well it's got\nthe the lockout to it\nit locks out really really well paired\nwith this pivot design from salsa\ni ended up using the salsa cycles pivot\ndesign\nin the the high position so the bottom\nbracket's a little bit higher so\ni don't have to deal with as much crank\narm to rock\npedal interference as far as the wheels\nare concerned i went with these industry\ntrail 280cs so carbon wheels\n28 hole wheels so they're super light 28\nmillimeter internal rim width\nso it's a perfect balance between trail\nand cross country i went with the 28\nhole wheels because\nwell i'm 150 pounds i'm not that heavy\nthe rig\nitself isn't that heavy they've proven\nto actually be really really durable\nthroughout the year\nand i've been testing them on the\narizona trail and just day ride so\ni'm very comfortable with 28 hole wheels\nso these wheels are 29-inch wheels\nand in my opinion it's the fastest\nrolling wheel\nwhile still being able to give you\nplenty of confidence and descending\nit's just the best rollover capability\nso i wouldn't ever use anything other\nthan a 29-inch wheel on the colorado\ntrail\nas far as tires are concerned i went\nwith the 29 by 2.4\nrecon up front and the 29 by 2.35\nardent race in the rear these are maxis\ntires these tires are awesome this is a\nreally great combination\nyou've got that max terra grip up front\nwhich conforms to the dirt the rocks a\nlittle bit more\nand then that max speed in the rear\nwhich rolls a little bit better\nboth patterns are great for dirt loose\nover hard that max tara up front\ndoes a little bit of a better job\nespecially digging into\nsome like wet loamy conditions and there\nwas a lot of that out there\nand then that arden race in the rear\ndoes a really good job of rolling\nespecially on pavement there are a few\nwilderness detours that we need to\ngo around so there is road it's not all\nsingle track so this tire combination\nhas that tubeless ready ex03c\ncompound so it's durable yet they're\nstill rather light\nso it's a great tire combination and\nthis is probably my\nfavorite tire combination that i've ever\nused on the trail and yes it's\ndefinitely more\naggressive than i've ever used but it's\ndefinitely more confidence\ninspiring which i think actually makes\nme go a little bit faster\n12-speed uh 30 tooth up front\nand then a 51 10 rear cassette this is a\npretty good combination for climbing\ni'd in the past i've used a 28 tooth up\nfront\nuh this year i went with the a30 just\nbecause i couldn't actually find a 28\ntooth without using\nsay like a wolf tooth camo system with\nthat chain line and all that but with\nthat 30 51\ni'm going pretty slow i'm going like two\nsome odd miles an hour\nso at that point if it's any more\ndifficult i may as well just get off and\nwalk my bike\nxt shifter slx rear derailleur as far as\nthe chain is concerned i had to lube my\nchain\npretty often probably once every three\nhours or so\nso that was something that i really had\nto keep up with otherwise it wouldn't\nshift nearly as well as you would hope\nas far as brakes are concerned i went\nwith xt brakes as well\nbut this bike stock came with two piston\nbrakes and i had four piston brakes at\nhome\nbasically all i did was swap out to four\npiston calipers on this bike and four\npiston calipers are they're just a\nlittle bit more powerful but what i find\nwith four piston\nbrakes is it's just much easier on the\nhands\nyou don't have to grip that lever nearly\nas hard to get it to work and that's\nsomething that's\nappreciated especially over four days on\na\nrather rough and rocky trail and\nhydraulic brakes i'm actually going to\ndo a video on\nthe benefits of hydraulic over\nmechanical but uh just the modulation\nthe the fact that all i have to do is\nfeather the brakes it it's just a lot\neasier on the hands and that's why i go\nwith hydraulic\nover mechanical and yes there is some\nrisk there but i've never had a\nhydraulic brake fail on me and then as\nfar as the rotors are concerned i went\nwith 180 millimeter rotor up front 160\nin the rear\nand my brake pads they're actually in\ndecent shape that front brake pad\nuh definitely has plenty of life left to\nit the rear ones i'm gonna actually\nprobably replace here in a second they\nlasted longer there's\na lot more contact patch on that brake\npad to stop so\nif it was a single or two piston brake i\ndefinitely probably would have had to\nreplace those pads but\nbecause there is just more surface area\nto rotor i feel like that actually\nhelped\nsave that pad life a little bit more and\nthen up front here i went with a\nfox step cast 34 it's 120 millimeter\nfork it's a reliable fork it's got the\nfit4 damper it's got a really good\nlockout to it especially when i'm riding\nthose\nthose wilderness detours making sure\nit's locked out just\nto hammer uh be able to stand up and not\nlose that energy and then just rounding\nout the contact\npoints um i went with a race face\nturbine stem\na salsa rustler 35 mil handlebar so a\nlittle bit of a stiffer bar and i\nreally like this style of bar it's got a\n20 degree rise to it i believe has a 9\ndegree back sweep not a ton\nbut a knot still allows me to kind of be\nset up in a nice aggressive position\nfor all the trunk on the colorado trail\nergon ga3 grips\none of my favorite types of grips out\nthere has a nice little paddle like this\nand this grip worked really well for me\ni opted out of using a bar end because\nthis grip doesn't allow you to use a bar\nend with it but what i ended up doing\nwas adding a little bit of tape\non the bar itself up here so i just used\nsome envy\ntape that i had some leftover on and\nbasically was able to kind of\nhang out on the bar for wilderness\ndetours or just\ngoing into towns and then also just\nbeing able to grip here just another\ndifferent position and then in the back\nhere i went with the adjustable transex\ndropper post and this dropper post came\non the bike\nand yes it's adjustable so it is 130\nmillimeter dropper post\nbut you can make it a 100 millimeter\ndropper post by taking 30 millimeters\nof dropper travel out of the post and\nthat's what i ended up doing and then i\nended up adding this wolftooth valet\ni just wanted to make sure that i wasn't\nactually hitting this saddle bag on my\nrear tire\nso just talking about what's on the bars\nfor navigation i used an e-trax 32x\nand actually did a full review on the\ne-track series and that's linked below\nif you want to check that out there's a\nlot of people that commented in that\nreview saying are you kidding me you're\nusing that ancient device\nwell yeah i'm still using that ancient\ndevice but really it\nis the best device for bike packing\nbecause you don't have to charge it\nand it's just one less thing to deal\nwith it just takes two double a\nbatteries i ended up starting with two\nfresh\nultimate lithium batteries and i\nreplaced them just once and i still have\nprobably half the life left in those\nother ultimate lithium batteries in here\nstill\nso really it's not too much of a waste\nand it's just one less thing to actually\nthink about\nso etrex for the win then i also have a\nreally nice spur cycle\nbell on here and uh it's just it just\nallows me to party on the trail\ni just like to ring it when i'm alone or\nif somebody can't hear me on the trail\nor if a backpacker has ear plugs in or\nsomething like that\ni'll ring that really lightly so that\nsomebody can hear me and then on the top\nhere this is a\nphoenix bc21r and if you go to phoenix's\nwebsite\nthey're not available but they're still\non the website so i'm not\nexactly sure what's going on but it is\nhands down one of my favorite lights\nit's\ngot a nice wide beam to it it has the\nability to go over a thousand lumens\nwhen you need it but i usually run it on\nthe 150 lumen setting\nwhich is plenty when i'm climbing really\nslow single track and then paired with\nthat i was using a phoenix uc35 which is\nmore of a tactical spotlight\non the top of my helmet that worked\nreally nice and paired those two\ntogether use the exact same type of\nbatteries rechargeable\n18 650 batteries so um it just\nthey're interchangeable they work really\nwell and that's why i use them and\nthey're\nthe batteries are super light and the\nlights are super light all right so\ngetting into the bags here so\nthis is the revelate designs vole and\nthis is a\ndropper specific seat pack from revelate\ndesigns\nand this bag has really seen quite a bit\nover the past few years for me and it's\nheld up really well it works\nspecifically with this wolftooth valet\nit actually comes with the wolftooth\nvalet so in this bag it's pretty simple\ni've got my\nbig agnes pluton 40 degree sleeping bag\nit's kind of like a quilt sleeping bag\nit's not like a full on\nover the head sleeping bag it's packed\ninside\ncurrently my mont bell sleeping bag\ncover which is water resistant it's not\nquite waterproof but that works really\nwell it's super light\nand they pack in together inside that\npluton sleeping bag is an extra pair of\nbibs and we'll get into\nmy bib situation in the question and\nanswer\nbecause it's pretty interesting and then\nat the end of the bag here is a down\njacket a really lightweight\ndown jacket from adidas terrax i never\nended up putting that on\nexcept once when it was rather cold but\notherwise\nit's more of an emergency situation it's\na good idea to carry\na jacket in general especially in\ncolorado where it probably can snow on\nyou\nin uh in july moving up to the frame\nback so this is a little bit more\nintricate and i'll actually unpack this\nstuff in front of you here\nessentially the frame bag has my repair\nkit\nmy dopp kit and my electronics kit plus\na handful of repair items such as a tube\npump spokes all of that stuff so this is\nmy dopp kit\nthis basically has just a first aid kit\nin it it's got some wipes in it it's got\nmy toothbrush\nuh it's got a lighter it's got just some\nkind of emergency items\na trowel in here when i you know you\nneed to do your business\nand then in this little electronics\nbaggie is basically all of the items\nthat i would need for\nbasically all of my lights all of my\nelectronics\nand my phone so i've got some cords to\ncharge not only my phone but just in\ncase i ran out of\nlight battery i can charge those\nbatteries i always carry an extra\nlight so this is just a black diamond\nstorm\nuh headlight and it basically just has\nsome one wrap\non it so that i can easily strap it to\nmy helmet just in case\ni lose my helmet light or one of my\nlights breaks or i run out of batteries\ncompletely\ni've got a adapter to just plug into an\noutlet\nand then this one here is just an anchor\nbattery pack this is a\n10 000 milliamp hour battery pack so\nit's not\nsuper heavy but it's not light either\nbut this is so that i can recharge my\nphone\num when i'm out there on trail i like to\nlisten to podcasts i'll listen to music\nand just being able to recharge it at\nnight just to ensure that i have that\nability to do so in the future\nis kind of important and it's a good way\nto just make sure that\nyou can have juice in your phone in case\nof emergencies or something like that\nand then i carried seven including the\nbatteries that were in the lights to\nstart with\nthese of these 18 650 batteries and i\ndefinitely didn't need to carry that\nmany but it's always a good idea just in\ncase\nand then i ended up carrying four\nenergizer ultimate lithium batteries\nand these batteries are just the longest\nlasting battery out there\ndouble a batteries for my e-tracks so i\nwas left with\ntwo extra batteries so at the bottom of\nthe bag here is my full repair kit and\ni'm not going to take that out in this\nvideo because i did a\nfull repair kit video and that is linked\nbelow\nthat details every single thing that i\ncarry in my repair kit\nwhich is extremely robust it's heavy but\nit's worth it because well you don't\nwant to\nbe stuck out there and you want to make\nsure that you finish a ride like this\nand we'll get into more of that in the\nquestion and answer because someone\nasked me about mechanicals\nso the rest of the space was filled up\nby these two 500 milliliter soft flasks\nand i would start uh the race with these\nempty and really the only time i would\nactually fill these up\nwas one stretch in the cochitope area\nwhere it's dry or it's it has water that\nis\nfilled with cow crap and then i also\ncarried a bunch of tailwind nutrition in\nthis frame bag this these little packets\nright here they just go\nin your fl saw flask or your\nwater bottle and it comes with 200\ncalories per pack here so you're not\nonly hydrating it's also a good source\nof electrolytes\ngives you all the fuel you need to\nreplenish and\nthis stuff has been working really well\nfor me for\ni don't know probably five years now and\nsome of the some of the tailwind\nendurance fuel has\ncaffeine the caffeine stuff is great and\nit's an extra jolt when you need it and\nthen starting the race\nuh basically from here on up was\ncompletely empty and that was for\nextra storage for food and for calories\nso basically from durango to silverton\num i didn't carry anything in there but\nthen from\nsilverton to buena vista that's a really\nlong stretch without any\nuh resupply points and so what i ended\nup doing was\nactually spending 70 dollars in\nsilverton\nto basically make sure that i had enough\nfood to get to buena vista\nand that was roughly i think 12 000\ncalories so a lot of calories a lot of\nfood\nit takes up a lot of space so having\nthat extra space in that frame bag was\nimportant\njust quickly talking about this custom\nframe bag from rock ice\nthat i got this frame bag i think in\nand it's worked really really well it's\nseen quite a bit of use\ni i really like it because i can adjust\nmy uh\nmy rear suspension and then talking\nabout this top tee bag this is\nan andrew the maker top two bag this is\nmy favorite top two bag\nmainly because it looks pretty awesome\nbut it fits a lot as well it's a direct\nmount top two bag so it bolts into the\ntwo direct mounts that salsa has\nbasically in here i just carry all of my\nfood at least a lot of food\nthe food that i want to access rather\neasily and then up front i had the\nandrew the maker bar bar bag and this\nbag is great this is the xl version so\nit's a little bit wider\nand in this bag basically carries all of\nthe kind of the layers that i would need\nthroughout the day starting with\na rain jacket and i ended up putting\nthis on and off taking it on and off\nhundreds of times throughout the uh the\nrace especially\nover the first few days because i got a\nlot of rain\nso this is the black diamond storm light\nstretch rain shell\nthis is actually a brand new rain jacket\ni wanted something kind of fresh\nsomething with a fresh dwr coat just to\nmake sure that i would stay dry\nso i've talked about these rain pants\nbefore this is a sierra designed\npretty cheap rain pant and i cut them\nright below the knee so it's almost a\nthree-fourths\nlength rain pant and i do this because i\ncan actually\nput them on and off over my\ncycling shoes without actually having to\ntake my cycling shoes off\nso these not only keep me relatively dry\nbecause rain pants full rain pants your\nfeet are gonna get wet no matter what\nbut they also\nact as a knee warmer or a warmer in\ngeneral\nand it keeps you warm so i actually\nended up using this\ninstead of my knee warmers but i did\nbring knee warmers\nnext time i'm not going to do that and\nthen these are the 45 north i believe\nthese are called the knock-in gloves and\nthese are just some soft shell gloves\nthey just keep me a little bit warmer\nwhen when it's cold out in the morning\nor if it's raining out i'll definitely\nput these on the gloves aren't water\nwaterproof at all\nso they will absorb but they will keep\nyou warm all right so quickly talking\nabout what's on me so as far\nas shoes i'm i was using some x-alp\nlaunch summits\nand i'm gonna do a full review on those\nshoes because i love them\nand they deserve it and they held up\ngreat even on\nprobably the roughest of trails because\ni probably ended up hiking like 50 some\nodd miles or something like that\nand then i was using some swift wick\ncompression socks\nand those socks are fantastic after days\non end\nof hiking your bike your feet being\nlower than your heart\njust swelling happens and those socks\nwork really well in kind of reducing the\nswelling at least\nat your feet because when your feet\nswell then there's no real place for\nthat swelling to go\nin your shoe and typically what happens\nis your\nyour toenails will swell you'll stub\nyour toe um you'll get blisters\nall this and it's really not good i've\nlost plenty of toenails because of it\nand those swift wick socks definitely do\na good job of at least alleviating that\nsomewhat so i was using some paktimo\nbibs the first day\ni carried these gore bibs in my sleeping\nbag like i was mentioning\nand these are just the long distance\ngore bib these hands down have been some\nof my favorite bibs that i've used\nrecently and i've used a lot of bibs\nthis year i'm actually going to do a\nvideo on chamois and bibs in the not too\ndistant future but uh yeah\nvery excited about these gore bibs and\nthen i used just an over short just some\nadidas terrax shorts and i went with\nsome over shorts this year just\nto keep me a little bit warmer when it\ndid get cold so i wouldn't\nactually have to add some knee warmers\nor throw on those rain pants and then i\nused a pearl azumi base layer just to\nput underneath my jersey\nand then a jersey here and this is a\npack teemo jersey um but the cool thing\nabout this jersey paired with\nmy uh vest is i can access all\nof the things in my jersey pockets and\nthis is the main reason why i use\na jersey like this because i like to use\nthese pockets because these are\nsuper easy to access so i'll have my\nknee warmers which i\nnever ended up using i'll have a vest\nand a buff\nand then i also have my arm warmer and\nthen my helmet was a smith\nnetwork helmet one of my favorite\nhelmets it's not a full coverage helmet\nit's more\nof like a commuter road helmet but the\nbig component here for\nmy race was the ultimate direction\nultravest\nand this vest sits higher on the back\nthis vest is great because\nit fits two liters of water plus two\nflasks up front that are 500 milliliters\nso the bag\ncan fit three liters it has all of these\nnooks and crannies to fit\neverything else and i'm going to show\nyou exactly what i fit on this bag now\nso in the back here it fits a two liter\nhydration pack a hydro pack hydration\npack\nthere's a side pocket right here and i\nended up fitting my wallet in this side\npocket\nbut also my spot device my spot device\nwas just right on top here\nand it read really well i kind of looked\nat my my tracker again\nit was pretty accurate there's a few\ntimes where it was off and that was\nprobably because i was in the woods and\ni couldn't read it accurately\nbut in general i was really happy with\nwhere that spot was and\nhow it actually read the the satellites\nit's got a main compartment here\nand in this main compartment i carried a\nton of food oh look at this\nnutty bar never ended up using it\nthat'll be for dessert tonight\nbut i carried a ton of food in here but\ni also carried my spare\nlenses for my sunglasses so my clear\nlenses and then just\nlike a little chamois to clear clean off\nthose lenses\ntalking about sunglasses so i ended up\nusing some smith sunglasses that came\nwith\na photochromatic lens so essentially it\nwould adjust with the\ndaylight uh in the sun and then at night\ni would put in the clear lens which is\njust a little bit clearer than that\nclear portion of the photochromatic lens\nand that setup worked extremely well for\nme so it's got this other slip pocket\nright here and i could fit more food in\nhere and that's what i did and then it's\ngot these bungees in the back which is\nsuper nice\ni never ended up using the bungees but\nif i was to say clean an article of\nclothing\ni could kind of wrap it through these\nbungees and let the sun hit down on the\nclothing so it would dry\nand then there's another pocket all the\nway down here i ended up using some\ngloves and\ni don't think they're latex because most\nof these gloves aren't latex anymore but\nthese are nice because it keeps you a\nlittle bit warmer especially when it's\nwet so\nwhen it was raining on me i would throw\nthese on and then those\nthose 45 north gloves it would just keep\nthat heat in kind of acting as a vapor\nbarrier so that's the back of the pack\nbut up front here is the cool part of\nthe bag so up front i had just a quick\nmulti-tool and this is nice because if i\nneeded to do anything on the fly i can\nadjust\nmy bike without actually having to go\ninto my repair kit in my frame bag i\nalso had some aqua mira tabs\nin here and then i don't have it here\nright now but one of the flasks\nright here i actually ended up losing\none of the flasks out there i started\nwith two\nand i it must have fallen out while i\nwas descending somewhere\nbut uh i would have one flask in here\nand then by the end of the route\nbecause i lost the other one i ended up\nputting some\nsome different items in this pretty\nconvenient area where the other flask\nwould be\nso some chain lube in there which i used\nevery three hours or so\nalso in that compartment where that\nflask would go i used the water\ntreatment the aquamira water treatment\npart a part b\nyou would mix it up wait five minutes\nand then throw it in your water wait\nanother 15 minutes and then you can\ndrink it\nthis is nice because you can end up\ndrinking your water a little bit quicker\nthan say those aquamira tablets\nand it still kills giardia and all that\njunk that\nyou don't really want to get especially\nin colorado there's a ton of\ncattle livestock open grazing it's\nreally nice to have something that you\nknow will kill\nor at least 99.9 know you'll kill all of\nthat junk\nthis little pouch down here i just\ncarried some first ascent\ninstant coffee this coffee is really\ngood first of sense out of crested butte\ncolorado\nand what i would ended up doing was just\nfilling up one of my flasks with water\nthrowing this in there and basically\nkind of just sitting down for like 10\nminutes and\nchugging the coffee uh and it worked\nreally really well\nand then lastly there's a zipped pocket\ndown here and this is kind of where i\ncarried all of my\npills i ended up carrying some ibuprofen\nand used that\nactually and then i also had a baggie of\nother things so i had some glutamine\npills so i would take that before\ni'd go to sleep and glutamine helps with\nrecovery it also helps with gut health\ni've got some vitamins in here i took\nthose too it couldn't hurt right\nand then some cbd soft gels and then\nfinally\none of my most used items is just some\nsunscreen in there\nand i ended up getting another bottle of\nsunscreen i used a ton of sunscreen out\nthere\nso that does it for the bike the rig\neverything in the bags\nwhat i was wearing what's in this\nawesome pack so i'm gonna head back to\nthe shop\nand now answer some of your questions so\nif you like what you see in our videos\nmake sure to hit that

for the\nsupport so in one of my instagram\nstories last week i asked all of you\nwhat questions you had based on my\ncolorado trail experience and\nexperiences as a whole\nand if you want to follow me on\ninstagram it's neil underscore\nbelchenko and the spelling of my name is\nin the description\nso toby has a great question he says no\ndynamo\nhow do you manage power for lights for\nall night riding\nso in 2014 i actually used a dynamo hub\non the root and it worked really well\nwhen i was descending at high speeds\nbut when i'm climbing at say two miles\nan hour it just does not produce enough\nlight\nso i decided i'm never going to use a\ndynamo again on the colorado trail just\nbecause\ni'm not averaging a high enough speed so\nthat's why i bring extra batteries\nthat's why i bring that battery pack\njust to ensure that i have that power to\nget me through\nthe race say if i was doing the tour\ndivide obviously that race is much\nlonger\nand your average speed is definitely\nhigher so i can get away with using a\ndynamo hub for that race\nbut for the colorado trail race i don't\nso miles here at bikepacking.com asks\ni want to know about food slash calories\nwhat did a typical day look like\nso calories is obviously extremely\ndependent on\nhow hard you're riding the size of the\nperson\naltitude there's a number of different\nfactors for me personally i'm looking\nanywhere from\n200 to 300 calories per hour\nso that's how i do my math so when i'm\nin silverton getting food\ni have to figure out all right it's\ngoing to be roughly what 35\nhours from silverton to buena vista\nand then i do the math and i think i\ncame up with like 12 000 calories and\ni had a bunch of food already so that's\nmy main ingredient for figuring out how\nmany calories i need\nobviously starting in durango you're\nfresh so you're not having as much and\nthen\nchowing down a bunch of food in\nsilverton i don't necessarily\nneed as many calories as twelve thousand\nso i definitely\nwas under that when i left silverton but\ni got to bv with plenty of food and\nit worked out for me you just gotta\nfigure out what works out for you\nand then there was a bunch of questions\nfrom folks about what type of food i'm\neating\nso basically i'm starting with kind of\nbars and the typical food that you would\nfind for day rides\nbars gels goose stuff like that\nbut as you kind of go throughout the\nrace you kind of want\nmore real food so in silverton i got\npizza\nand i really enjoy pizza so i got pizza\nin um in bueno vista i got a burrito\nin leadville i got breakfast sandwiches\nand i actually started carrying that\nstuff so i brought a breakfast sandwich\nate one brought one on the trail with me\nso\njust trying to find real food out there\nafter a while my tongue kind of\nbreaks down and really doesn't like\nreally exotic foods or even really salty\nfoods after a while so i have to be\nconscious of that so a lot of nuts\ni'll just start eating nuts and just\nbars and stuff like that\nreally it's not all that glorious i\nreally\nenjoy gummy bears gummy worms um\nswedish fish so yeah just whatever kind\nof looks good when i go in the store\nthat's kind of what i'll buy\nso rob asks what's the main difference\nbetween your race rig\nand your bike packing rig and really\nthere's not a huge difference the\nbiggest\ndifference here is a tent more than\nlikely i'm always going to be carrying a\ntent or some sort of shelter\njust because it's a little bit more cozy\nand if it rains at night i\nprobably won't get wet versus sleeping\nin a bivvy sack\nthere's definitely potential for me to\nget wet and then i'll also be bringing\njust an extra pair of clothes i'll be\nbringing long johns\ni'll probably have maybe a flask in\ngeneral i'll more than likely have a\nbigger handlebar bag than i did in this\nsetup\nwhere i can actually store that stuff\nand then i'll also be carrying a stove\nand obviously freeze-dried meals or some\nsort of meal\nuh that uses a stove some oatmeal stuff\nlike that\nsomeone asked if i actively changed tire\npressures throughout the race\ni set my rear tire at 23 psi\nand i set my front tire at 20 psi and i\ndid not touch it throughout the whole\nafter every descent i'll probably feel\nmy tires just to make sure that there's\nproper air pressure in them\nuh after that big descent but i never\ntouched my tire pressure\nand i didn't have to add any air to my\ntires\nfor this race so someone asked what do\nyou call it during a mechanical so say i\nhave a mechanical\nand i just can't make it work i can't\nlimp home anymore\nso there's a few things obviously you\nknow if your derailleur hangers break\nand i actually was carrying an extra\nderailleur hanger and i use\nwheels manufacturing derailleur hangers\njust because they are a little bit\nstronger than the stock derailleur\nhangers that come\non this salsa cycle spearfish another\nthing would be a broken frame\nbut i would definitely tell you to look\nat my repair kit resource that i have\nbecause it kind of goes into detail on\nhow much i can actually fix\non my bike and really it's quite a bit\neverything from\nsewing a slash sidewall obviously\nrepairing your chain\nrepairing all the bolts on my bike\nreally these bikes have come a long way\nthey are super strong durable and\nthey're made for this\ntype of terrain so i'm really not\nworried about the bike\nas much as i am the body and well\nprobably the weather and stuff like that\nso what's your hygiene protocol for the\nrace someone asked that's a really\nreally good question so when you're\nriding for four straight days with very\nminimal sleep\nthat means that your body isn't\nrecovering and because it's not\nrecovering\nwell it's just kind of getting beaten\ndown more and more and more\nand that is the case for the rear end\nand so yes i have to take care of myself\nand so this year that's why i use\nthose two bibs and why i use two\ndifferent types of bibs\nbecause when i sit down on the saddle\neach chamois of the bib\nis going to kind of react a little bit\ndifferently so when i was using the\nbibs the first day those weren't they\njust weren't very friendly to my butt\nuh for some weird reason i don't know\nwhy so then i used the gore bibs for the\nrest of the three days\nand they worked really well yes my butt\ndoes scab\nup but we do not need to get into that i\nbrought some antibiotic cream\nand i put it on that before i went to\nsleep and then i also have some\nsunscreen that can kind of double as\nlotion to kind of help heal it up using\nyour resources\nand just kind of figuring out how it\nworks but obviously grocery stores gas\nstations all have\nstuff to help heal sores like that so\nsomeone asked what piece of gear can you\nditch to save weight\nand actually this year i added a piece\nof gear pretty big piece of gear and\nthat is my sleeping bag\nmy thought process here was i wanted a\nlittle bit better sleep in\npast years i found myself shivering at\nnight even with a down jacket on\nso this year i wanted to bring a\nsleeping bag so that i had a more\ncomfortable night rest\nso that i could actually recover even\nthough i'm not sleeping that much so i\nadded\nmy 40 degree pluton big agnes sleeping\nbag and i was really happy i brought it\nalthough the first two nights i really\ndid not sleep that well\num and then that last night i got\nprobably an hour and a half of sleep\nand i just conked out for an hour and a\nhalf straight and it felt really really\ngood\nbut i would definitely bring that\nsleeping bag again but one thing i don't\nbring i never have is a sleeping pad\nbut typically i can find some really\nnice loamy areas to\nto sleep on and typically the ground\nisn't super super cold\nif it had rained or something like that\nit's definitely going to be colder\nso usually the sleeping pad the\ninsulation isn't\nnearly as important in the summer in\ncolorado but\nit can be it definitely can snow so you\njust got to pick and choose if you want\nto bring one or not and i've just\nopted out of bringing one for four races\nnow\nsomebody asked how do you deal with the\nweather you all had\nthat's a really good question uh it's a\nlot of mental strength a lot of pushing\nthrough\nunderstanding it hopefully will end you\nknow\nand uh and it did and that's the beauty\nof\nuh monsoonal moisture typically it does\nend it's not a consistent rain\nalthough it has happened before but this\nyear i\ngot out of silverton and it just dumped\nrain on me uh i got up to\n12 13 000 feet and it started raining on\nme even more\nsideways wind and i actually turned my\nbike\naround at one point and i was like i\nneed to go back to get to shelter\nbecause this is\nscary and then i had a talk with myself\nturned my bike back around i was like\nneil if you go back\nyour race is done and so i just kept\npushing on through\nso it's a it's a lot of mental and these\ntypes of rides these types of races\ni always say it's 50 mental 50\nphysical you have to physically be\nprepared for\nyou know the altitude the really steep\nclimbs descents\nuh the rough terrain but you also have\nto be mentally prepared to\nkind of fight the weather a little bit\nand if there was lightning or something\nlike that obviously i'd be taking\nshelter but i didn't have to deal with\nlightning this year\nin past years i have and i've stayed at\ntreeline but\nthis year we're we're pretty lucky and\nreally the the first day was the only\nreal bad day i got wet the second day as\nwell but in general\nyeah just be mentally prepared and\nthat'll help that'll go a long way so\nthe last question is\nwhat ipa did i choose at the end and i\nactually i i finished at seven in the\nmorning\nand i went home and i slept and i don't\neven remember the first beer i drank but\ni do believe it was an ipa i don't know\nif it was a hazy or whatnot but\ntypically after the end of these races\ni'm just really beat up and uh\njust exhausted my wife\nalways takes photos of me sleeping in\nthe car and\ni'm just just conked out just really\ntired\num at night i'm just like uh making\nnoises\nwhile i'm sleeping and it's really kind\nof entertaining it's like uh just\nfull-on exhaustion and as the week\nprogresses i get better and better but\nit's uh it's it definitely takes a lot\nout of you\nso thank you all so much for the\nquestions thank you all so much for\nwatching i truly\ntruly truly appreciate it and until next\ntime\npedal further\n[Music]"
