      "description": "Several shots I choose from the race. Mile 4 the knee does not feel normal and I feel i could not keep up with lead group. Mile 52 (ish) in the single track I also lost the group again and also legs start to shut down. Could not catch 2nd group. Last 10 miles was just to keep going and hope nobody from behind overtook me which seems to be that. So far satisfy with results. A little mishap like a super wide turn and sketchy front wheel slide on loose gravel but overall the race went well. Weather is PERFECT! Volunteer and marker and direction signs are one of the best so far! Also got a best power for 200 minutes, not just that I feel I can handle surges and hills much better too, but still not there yet... Keep riding!!!",

Due to poor course markings that caused a crash in the same spot last year \ud83e\udd2c. Lots of road rash, bruised hip, ribs and a cracked helmet, but able to continue although with a rubbing front brake rotor. Attached onto a diesel and he dragged me to the finish as we picked off and added a few along the way. Somehow I was able to still win the group sprint for 24th overall. Not the day I wanted but tried to make the best of it.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Hey! SUBSCRIBE for more race content \ud83d\udc49 https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsr-SU_SAqjrzmu4kXIRfUQ?sub_confirmation=1",
