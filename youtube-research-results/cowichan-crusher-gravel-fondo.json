      "transcript": "This was supposed to have been our first\ngravel race of\n2025. We packed our bags. We'd loaded up\nour bikes onto the car and we traveled\nfrom Vancouver all the way to Cow and\nLake to take part in this year's Cowin\nCrusher 2025.\nBut even the bestlaid\nplans don't necessarily always pan\nout. That's what this story is all\nabout. Okay, we\nare getting ready for our\nfirst gravel fondo of the year.\nWe've come we've traveled all the way to\nLake\nKawichan to do our first gravel fondo of\nthe year. This is the first time that\nCatherine is going to be racing in the\n60 plus age category. I don't think it\ncounts cuz we're in as a team.\nBut after all the training we've done\nand all the\npreparation, I woke up the other\nday feeling not so great. You can\nprobably hear it in my\nvoice.\nSo, so the question\nis, will I be racing tomorrow with\nCatherine or will she be doing it all on\nher own solo?\nWe would be my first solo event. So, I'm\nactually I'm already proud of myself and\nI haven't even set till across the\nstarting line.\nSo, tune in to see whether or\nnot we get to both race, the couch and\ncrusher tomorrow or whether it's just\ngoing to be one of us. We are signed up\nfor the medio. They've had to change the\ncourse this year because of um some\nconstruction on the rail trail. So,\nit'll going to be it's going to be a new\ncourse this time around. So, yeah, that\nwill be something different. It'll be\nexciting. So, after picking up our race\nnumbers, Catherine and I jumped on our\nbikes and we headed out for a 40minute\nshakeout ride just to see how both of us\nwere feeling. I just wanted to know\nwhether or not I was going to be able to\nride at all the next day. I was after\nthe race package pickup, I was feeling a\nlittle bit more confident that I would\nbe able to ride the 60 kilometer race.\nAnd certainly riding out along the rail\ntrail made me feel a whole lot more\nconfident about my ability to do the\nride the next day. It's just such a\nbeautiful ride along the Cow and Valley\nRail Trail. The scenery is so\nspectacular and you get to cross these\namazing trestle bridges that I always\njust find so uh appealing. So as I say\nwe went out for a 40inut shakeout ride.\nI think we both felt good after the\nride. I certainly felt confident by the\nend of that\nride. That confidence was maybe a little\nbit premature though. In 40 minutes, we\nreally I think only covered about 18\nkilometers. So, we went 9 km out and 9\nkm\nback. But, as I say, it was a nice way\njust to get out on our bikes and just\nsee how we were both feeling. On our way\nout, we saw a few people riding, some of\nthem riding in groups, obviously getting\nready for the event the next day. The\ncow and crusher this year had four\ndifferent lengths. The longest being 160\nand the shortest being 25 km. As I say,\nwe had signed up for the medio which is\nabout 60 km long. Okay, so we've just\ncome back from our quick little 40minute\nuh shakeout ride. The shakeout ride that\nHuman Go had instructed me to do. I\ndon't know\nhow how accurate or how true to the\nworkout I stayed, but I just thought I\nwanted to get out and see how I'm\nfeeling. I can feel that I'm a bit under\nthe weather, but I think I'm healthy\nenough that I can get out and ride\ntomorrow morning. So, that's okay. It's\nrace\nmorning. I was coughing a lot last\nnight.\nUm, so we've both decided we're just\ngoing to do\nthe shorter race this morning. Was\nreally looking forward to this race as\nthis is the first time we're both going\nto be racing in the 60 plus age\ncategory.\nBut I figured\nmaybe just doing the shorter race would\nbe better than nothing at\nall. Little\n[Applause]\ndisappointing, but I figured I better\nlisten to my body. How are you feeling,\nCatherine? I feel great.\nNothing wrong with this one.\nSo, we're here at\nthe start line.\nnumbers look uh numbers look a little\nlower this year which is too bad because\nthis is such a great race.\nWe made the effort to get over to\nKawichin and the thought of leaving\nwithout having done at least the short\nrace sort of weighed on me a little bit.\nOkay, so this is the medial raceinated\nlining up\nand the meteor race\nis on. Someone that we were just talking\nto um who's local has written that\ncourse and says it's actually really\npretty lot of like a 20 km climb up and\nthen when you go down you lose that\nelevation and 4 km so it's steep on the\nend but then once you come along the\ngravel shore road really beautiful again\nso he says it's a really lovely course\nnext year. Why are you the sexy\nseahorses?\nWell I figured you don't want children\nand I'm gay so we have to do something.\nOkay,\nthat that makes perfect sense. It's just\na bit of fun. Yeah. Three, two, one.\nOkay, great, guys. Have fun out there.\nBeautiful day. See you at the finish.\nThanks, guys.\nAnd we're off. My head wanted to do the\n60 km race, but my heart was saying the\n25 km race was going to be the better\noption for that day. So, we went out.\nUm, initially I I was really a little\nhesitant and just wanted to take it as\neasy as I possibly could. So, the first\ncouple of kilometers of the ride, we\nwere both really just turning over the\npedals. We weren't really working all\nthat hard. But as the ride went along\nand we passed a few people on the\ntrail, I could sense my old competitive\nspirit bubbling up inside of me and we\nstarted picking up the pace a little\nbit. Certainly, Catherine started to\npick up the pace and we began to pass a\nfew more people along the ride.\nThe nice thing about doing the short\ncourse, as I say, is we get to ride on\nthe old rail\ntrail. The other\ncourses didn't come along here this\nmorning. And this is my favorite part of\nthe ride anyway. The morning had turned\nout to be a beautiful morning. The\ntemperatures were still a little cool.\nUm, we were both riding in arm warmers,\nbut the weather was certainly a whole\nlot better than the day before. Saturday\nmorning, the weather had just been\nmiserable. It had rained quite heavily,\nand I think we were both uh a little\napprehensive, thinking that those were\ngoing to be the weather conditions for\nrace morning. But race morning did turn\nout to be an absolutely beautiful day.\nWe both realized that this year's race\nwas held one month later than it's\nusually held. It's usually held at\nthe beginning of June or end of May. We\nwere glad that this year's event was\nhappening one month later. It meant\nconditions were going to be much\nnicer. How you feeling?\nOkay. Not great. Not great.\nOkay, we're just 9\nkilometers into the\nride. 23\nminutes, just passed Scoots\n[Music]\nFalls. I'm glad we're not doing the 60K\nride.\nOkay, we are at the turnaround.\n29 minutes\nin. So, we're 42 minutes\nin. I can de\ndefinitely I can definitely feel this\ncold in my chest.\nSo doing the shorter route today was the\nright\ncall. Even so, we\ngot a good hour of exercise\nin got to\nride the best part\nof the couch and valley.\nSo all things\nconsidered, things worked out well.\nHow can you not love this course?\nWoo. How did that feel? Good. My lunch\nstopped.\nOh well, that was good. I was just\ntrying to give a good hard effort on the\nway back. Yeah. So, we're just under an\nhour. I think we did all right all\nthings\nconsidered. I can definitely feel that\nride in my\nchest. So hopefully I haven't made\nmyself\nsicker. This is my favorite gravel race.\nThis event is just\nso it's lowkey. It's\ngrassroots. Uh and I love riding out on\nthe rail trail. It's just so\nbeautiful. So\ndefinitely in my opinion one of the best\ngravel gravel\nraces in\nBC coming in now. Well done Ali\nBalentine. Katherine Seers and Jeremy\nSeers coming in as well. Well done\nthere. So Jeremy says, Katherine says,\nand Ali Balentine all across the line in\nthis 25 km different distance.\nHer first time racing and she won. Wow.\n25K. So excited. How excited are you?\nI'm so excited. Never done a bike race\nin my life. Done lots of biking, but\nI've always been nervous to do a race.\nSo, yeah. Good for you. So, I really\nenjoyed that event today. Um, I was\nactually on the way out on the it a\nlittle bit of a what 2% downhill or\nsomething. I wasn't interested in kind\nof pushing it, but then at the\nturnaround point I got a bit of a mojo\nmoment and I was pushing it all the way\nhome.\nSo, good solid effort. Yeah. Yeah. The\nlast half I put in a good solid effort.\nHow about you? How are you feeling, J?\nYeah, I could definitely feel it in my\nchest a little bit. Chest feels a little\nbit tight, but yeah, I mean, we I think\nboth had a solid hours worth of\nexercise, which is good. I just hope\nthat doesn't exacerbate things.\nYou're You'll live. Okay, it's my\ndiagnosis. You'll live. Okay. After the\nrace, we took in a little bit of Cow and\nLake. We went\nto one of our favorite coffee places,\nEd's Coffee. Um, we walked across the\nlittle what used to be a little railway\nbridge uh across the river at the end of\nKowichin Lake.\nSo, some people come to this location\nafter the race just to get a little uh\njust to wash off and cool\ndown. So, it's the day after the race.\nWe uh managed to come first team. It was\na pretty small field, but yeah,\nKatherine was third woman overall and I\nwas third man overall. You can still\nhear that I'm\num definitely not\n100%. But I'm glad we did something. It\nwould have been a shame to have come all\nthis way and not participated in the\ncouch and crusher. So, thanks for\nwatching. If you like the video, give it\na thumbs up. Consider subscribing to the\nchannel and until we ride again, take\ncare."
