      "transcript": "[Music]\nall right folks it's race day here at\nthe crow Stan buck 50 we call it the\nbest bite game ever for a reason we've\ngot a 50 mile course out there that's\n99% gravel we have over 560 participants\nwe're really looking forward to seeing\nwho can bring home the title\nthe weather's beautiful savage road is\nin great shape and we look forward to\nseeing everybody crushing man we're here\nthe Carteret County Speedway about the\nlock and load do a little racing today\nhunter miles 50 miles 150 miles we're\ngonna send them out there into the woods\nand see how they come back I'm really\nexcited to see see this thing happen you\nknow we grew these things is here too\nand seeing all these people is like\nmission accomplished and so let's get\nhim out there it started off a little\nhectic I'm used to Road races with like\n60 women as a mass start so 550 people\nwas a new experience for me but I stayed\nsafe and\nfound a good group I think we had 30 the\nwhole the whole time and I just stayed\nwith them and race my own race\nit's very bumpy I think there were more\npotholes this year in the last year and\nespecially when you're like in a big\ngroup it started to see the potholes so\nI just like hit a lot of a lot of those\nsavage Road is always really fun I\ndefinitely enjoy like finding the line\nthrough that and overall like I had a\nreally good really good race and felt\nfelt good out there and it was it was\nreally fun\nI'd say almost 90% of the course was\nreally fast sandy gravel roads with\nthese big potholes and he'd just be in\nthe pack like three back five backs and\nthen bang just you know feel the bottom\nof the rim and the course was really I'd\nsay in good shape but I underestimated\nhow difficult the course would be\nprobably the ten miles to go Jeremiah I\ntook a look back and I probably had\nmaybe 10 feet on him so I just put my\nhead down and went and just kind of\nslowly got away from him\nand I don't know what the gap was by the\nend but I was I was preparing for a\nsprint finish but I was happy that it\ndidn't come down to that it's just a\ngreat spirit and vibe here like\neveryone's really excited and inclusive\nand the food is great and you know the\nstuff you get is great and the gravel\nroads are super fun to ride so it's a\ngreat race\n[Applause]\nat 560 people out the conditions were\npretty darn good and everybody that I've\nseen so far that's come back had a smile\non her face and that definitely makes it\nworthwhile"

      "description": "This is a story from that time we went to a bike race but there was no racing to be found. Little did we know this would be our last chance to ride together for a while. Even though our racing plans were derailed we were still able to ride together. We\u2019re super grateful to have these memories from this weekend. Looking back over them makes us even more excited for the day when we can ride together again.\nWe love you Croatan Buck Fifty and we will see you in 2021.",
