      "description": "July 8, 2017 marked the 7th running of Crusher in the Tushar, a gravel race held in the Tushar mountains near Beaver, Utah. Making this event unique is the high altitude and prevalence of extended climbing, which arguably makes Crusher in the Tushar one of the hardest gravel races on the planet, despite being 70 miles / 112 kilometres in length.\n\nJOM and the Gravel Cyclist crew of Mr and Mrs K-Dogg flew in from Gainesville, Florida to contest the event... from sea level with no acclimatization.

      "transcript": "welcome everyone to Unbound gravel race\nnumber two of the lifetime Grand Prix\nthese women are coming off some\nhard-fought results all right I'm bound\nI went so freaking hard the first three\nhours like I was like I might blow up\nand detonate but you know what this is\nwhat it's gonna take for me to win the\nrace to get a massive Advantage onto\neverybody else\n[Applause]\nyour winner of the Garmin Unbound gravel\nrace for 2022. what an incredible ride\nall by herself for over 80 miles\nSophia Gomez bishopane taking the win\nEmily knew some coming in second 20\nminutes down and Melissa Rollins in\nthird\nI am willing to risk losing the race in\norder to Win It In Our Lifetime Grand\nPrix overall standings we have Sophia\nGomez vichafane in the lead Haley Hunter\nSmith in second and Evelyn dong in third\nall of this training that has gone into\npreparing for this is definitely going\nto pay dividends when we get ready to go\nto Utah for Crusher and the toucher we\nare now two races into the lifetime\nGrand Prix and Leah Davidson has\nofficially announced that she has\nwithdrawn from the overall\n[Music]\nthank you\nholding to Beaver and I was like oh we\ndon't have brakes\nand then I was like oh the AC also went\nout we get home\nthe circus has arrived\nokay well it looks like Lawrence is\ndoing\n42s let's see is this Sophia's\nmmm interesting 38.\nthe only questions we have is bike\nracers now in my life is like do we wear\na pack and what tires are you running\nwell my name is Sarah Sturm my title is\nprofessional bike racer\nI pedal forward\nI always describe cycling as this\ntraveling circus and a series like this\nreally feels like it\nhi if you start seeing the same people\nat the same races and it's kind of nice\nhi which tires are you running\nRussell's running 38th I don't know what\nto do\nhere we are race three Crusher and the\ntoucher it's been a part of the lifetime\nfamily for about three years now Burke\nswindlehurst in his sadistic way created\nthis thing it's going to be a challenge\nit'll be a different different event\nit's tough to say is it a mountain\nbikers event is it a gravel Riders event\nwell oh there's never a perfect decision\nright well these are better because they\nhave gum walls oh yeah then let's do\nthat done done\nthis course has three sections\nthe first climb\nthe middle which includes a downhill and\nthen a flat section and then another\nmassive climb\nI think what differentiates Crusher from\na lot of events is obviously the\nMountaintop finish you know 69 miles and\n10 000 feet of climbing and a lot of his\nloose gnarly gravel\nI mean personally I think between the\nelevation gain the altitude the heat the\nsurfaces you're going to encounter and\nwhen you're going to encounter them\nit kind of throws the kitchen sink at\nyou out there I'm biased but I don't\nthink there's another event on the\nplanet that that packs more suffering on\na per mile basis than than this event\nEvelyn and I started racing around the\nsame time and we're good friends\nafter you darling we've bike packed\ntogether we've traveled a lot together\nEvelyn's always been just very chill you\nknow she can smile after a bad day and\ndoesn't really take it too seriously but\nshe does it because she loves it and she\nenjoys it\nI mean I might be laid back in life but\nI am very competitive\nand once the gun goes off it's just like\nputting yourself in that spot where\nyou're breathing through your eyeballs\nand there's like nothing else that\nreally satisfies that itch\nEvelyn's a Crusher this style of racing\nlike she could definitely throw down and\nshe makes it look so easy yeah Evelyn\nDunn 2019 she won Crusher in the tusher\nso she's going to be comfortable with\nsome of those harder uphill you know\ncrushing touch there's a lot of climbing\nso this final climb well when I heard\nabout the Grand Prix it really boosted\nsome motivation for me as I was\ncontemplating like when to end my career\nfor racing I guess it has some part in\nlike just providing some good motivation\nfor me this year with I guess a\ndifferent kind of challenge\nI have so much admiration and respect\nfor Rose\nshe's an extremely hard worker she's won\nLeadville twice if this series would\nhave happened in like 2018 2019 I think\nRose would have waxed all of us\nSophia she's in the thick of it you know\nshe's in the thick of being famous for\nher results she's growing she's\nembracing it all and this is her time\nfor the last race we did was in lovely\nEmporia Kansas\nwhere I became the new queen of gravel\nit's not going to last forever I think\nshe feels a bit tired\nmy biggest threat at this race I would\nsay is Alexis Garda but she got covered\nso if she doesn't come here\nI just have already such a huge lead I'm\nactually looking really good for the\nseries\noh take this with my own last year I\ndidn't pre-ride\nanything of the course and I still won\nso the appearance is bliss sometimes\nyeah and I but I did this last year\nyou've never been here before yeah right\nI've done this race twice cried my first\ntime said I never was gonna do this\nagain and then one at a second time okay\nI want to get ready I'm gonna give this\nto Myron so it's great she's great she's\na solid she's focused and uh hauling ass\nI mean I think we all put pressure on\nourselves like\nI've already won two of the biggest\nraces in the world\nbut in the Fuego adk and sea otter I\njust put myself into that last Hill when\nI tried to pass Mo\nscar is starting to struggle and it even\nlooks like Sophia is starting to\nstruggle Sophia Gomez via legs have\nblown up incredible Mariah Wilson just\nriding away from the other two Riders\nand the entire field here\nI just kind of gave up and then I\ncrossed the Finish Line in second\nand it just did not sit well with me at\nall\nso for the next two and a half three\nweeks like every training ride I like\nmentally put myself in that situation\nand I'm like that's the last time I'm\ngonna give up like that to a competitor\nI got into cycling six years ago when my\ncoach Carmen Small approached me she saw\npotential and she was like I would like\nto turn you from a cat one research in\nOlympian in four years and I was like\nthis woman is like bad chick crazy but\num whatever like let's try it\nevery year I just focused on myself and\nyou can see each year I just level up\nlevel up level up\na lot of my friends tell me like oh you\nkind of have this locked up in the bag\nI haven't been challenged in the way\nthat I thought I would\nI think I am the clear favorite so I\njust it would be sweet to kind of\ndeliver on that one\nyeah I think this race it pays dividends\nto know how to race it and kind of when\nto\nlet your efforts go like last year I\ndrilled it up this climb\nbeing a professional cyclist is never\nanything that I actually cared for it\nwas an accidental thing that happened I\nnever wanted to be an Olympian and here\nI am you know became an Olympian in\nTokyo\nI don't really give a if I win or\nnot like what I want to know is that I\ngave the best performance I'm capable of\nand to show the hard work and the\nsacrifice I put in every training ride\nand if you beat me like good for you but\nI'm never gonna give up and just kind of\nlet somebody beat me like that ever\nagain\nRace 3 is finally upon us and just as\nthe name suggests this race is a real\nCrusher climbing from 6 000 feet to 10\n000 feet twice mile per mile this may\nvery well be the hardest race in the\nseries who can guess what the standings\nwill look like after the dust settles\nfrom this year's Crusher and the tusher\nso as of right now you're currently\nsitting 17th overall on the lifetime\nGrand Prix series notably absent from\nthe Unbound 200 race in the lifetime\nGrand Prix there are six races and only\nfive of them count so when I started\nthis season I made the predetermined\ndecision that I would skip Unbound it\nwould allow me more opportunity to stay\nfresh and hopefully to be able to really\nexcel in these later races\nI've been racing Hannah Otto for a long\ntime like since high school like she was\nin Southern California I was in NorCal\neven in college we would race each other\nat Collegiate Nationals and she always\nkicked my ass like I just wow she's\nHannah so good and then I got training\nand then I got really fit and it's been\na long time\nthat Hannah has beaten me excited I'm\nreally curious to see how her season\ngoes her dream is in the Olympics so\nshe's having balance both schedules\nfired up not worried I think that is\nprobably her biggest weakness\nshe doesn't realize how big of a deal\nUnbound was and that could have made her\ncareer I was like well I mean great for\nme but sucks for you\nSophia's uh formidable competitor she's\nalways been very strong mentally and\nphysically and she's obviously on a high\npoint right now when Sophia won and she\nwas behind at the top of this climb that\nsaid\nevery rain comes to an end at some point\nit's just another one\nLeah Davidson and Casey Armstrong are\nnot coming it's just sad like there's so\nmany people that apply to have this\nopportunity to race the series and then\npeople aren't showing up to a race\nI don't know I just feel like the guys\nare fighting for this way harder than\nthe women are and we're gonna fight for\nequality we should show up\num all right I'll grab Alvin Ellen Ellen\nSophia is so pragmatic without she\nthinks about things I think she's pretty\nunfazed or at least she\nseems that way\nbut she's really like matter of fact if\nshe doesn't win she'll know exactly why\nand then she'll fix it for the next race\nand probably win that one well shall we\nhour and a half okay wow\nokay\nI have this theory that I'm only fast\nbecause I have no sense of time and I'm\nalways late to everything so I just have\nto go really hard to bring up naked\nplaces on time\noh now we are gravel racing\nI love the storm we are best friends we\nmet in college\nI'm so analytical or if Sarah is just\nracing in the moment and within the\nfeeling that she has so she's like\nwilling to take these flyers and\nsuicidal wounds and like actually that\nintimidates the field more than she\nprobably realizes\nwhat all kind of training goes into a\nseries like this\noh my gosh I'm the worst person to ask\nabout that\nI chose Fort Lewis College I got a\nscholarship for academics I was like\ninfatuated with Mountain Sports I did\njoin the Fort Lewis cycling team and\nthat was definitely one of the best\ndecisions of my life\nmy like junior year I got on a mountain\nbike and I was so insanely bad no one\nreally taught me how to do it I just\ncrashed a lot all the time I mean I\ndistinctly remember because I was 22\nwhen I like went for a mountain bike\nride and I didn't crash on just like a\nchill like Loop and that like really\nsticks out to me I'm like just sort of\nlike forced my way through it\nI quit racing because I wasn't having\nfun\nDylan and I were driving home from\nMarathon mountain bike Nationals and he\nkind of looked at me and was like are\nyou having fun racing I was like\nno\nand it kind of like made me realize that\nI maybe needed to like step away for a\nlittle bit\nI remember distinctly feeling like a\nvery much a loss of identity\nI mean it's something I think everyone\nhas to like go through at some point\nand then I started doing High Country\nmountain bike rides and I don't know\nenjoying like going and riding with my\nfriends\nwe would do hard rides on the weekends\nand the mountains and I was challenged\nby just the physicality of it but no one\ncared if you ever finished anything\nexcept for yourself and so I think that\nwas sort of starting to crack open that\nendurance thing for me\nwe were like cleaning out our things and\nI found this little box of memories\nwrote down all my goals for life and one\nof them was like become a professional\nmountain biker\nDylan was a huge part of like showing me\nall these other types of writing and\nlike racing and as cheesy as it sounds\nlike I did I was able to like find the\njoy in bike racing again\ncoaching definitely helps ground\neverything first met Ellen when she was\non the U14 during a Devo mountain bike\nprogram and I was the coach so I've\nreally seen Ellen grow up there's\nsomething really special about her and\nher spirit within the sport\nbeing in the Grand Prix that evolution\nof her story is awesome\nshe loves the long stuff and she she\nloves the suffer so I think it'll be\ngood\nright now she is just kind of doing the\nlast minute prep for herself because\nit's an early morning tomorrow with the\nrace starting at 6 55 I believe they go\noff\nyeah\nI think that's everything I just want to\nput this on the bike we'll see I think\nthe night before the race is always hard\nto sleep especially when you do it you\ngotta be like four a.m I like to know\nexactly what's coming and at what mile\nmarker so the first point of reference\nis 51.\n23.3 miles to go\nstarts the second climb I will tape it\nto the top of my bike and I'll have that\nto look at\nwith a hefty seven point lead in the\nstandings Sofia Gomez vichafane has been\ndominating the series and with her hot\nstreak there is an overwhelming\nconsensus that she is the rider to be\nhere in Beaver Utah not to mention she\nwon this same race last year on a\nmountain bike\njust because I've been kind of riding\nthis wave after Unbound we might take\nlike\na full week off the bike and just like\ncompletely reset yeah when do you think\nyou'll do that I think it's like\nstarting Sunday probably okay I haven't\nlike quite said much about it because I\ndon't want people to know that that's\nlike how I am right now\num because I think everyone\nexpects a performance out of me tomorrow\nyeah so I'm kind of definitely just kind\nof Faking it and like showing people how\nconfident I am trying to win the race\nbefore it starts yeah all right thank\nyou Vic all right talk to you soon all\nright bye\nwe're all human right and we all have\nemotion and that's the beauty of high\nperformance Athletics is that the\nconfidence is really what allows you to\nwin or not win a race and\nyou know you can definitely\nmind people pretty good Before the\nRace even starts and like even if you're\nfeeling like if you're telling\neverybody oh I'm feeling great Never\nFelt This Good like they will think of\nthat when they're suffering in the back\nof their head you know how all the dudes\ndid like the gentleman's agreement\nbefore like Unbound we should have a\ngentle woman's agreement yeah where to\nstop yeah\nthing is We're Not Gonna I'd be\nsurprised if you find yourself racing\nwith another woman\nafter Circleville I'm gonna be very like\nit goes\nthis race that's awesome gravel raising\nis for stopping and eating all the\nsneakity snacks yeah I'm uh\ndabbling and gravel\nsleep well bring your bone get your bone\nhere we are in Beaver Utah for Crusher\nand the toucher the third stop of the\nlifetime Grand Prix in a course unlike\nany other\nare the Riders ready and recovered after\n200 punishing miles in Emporia Kansas\ncan anyone Dethrone Sophia from her lead\nin the standings\none element that makes this race so\nunique is that you start at the bottom\nof the mountain and you finish at the\ntop\noh\nchicken's out\n[Laughter]\nready\nyou're allergic to poultry\nhe's so guilty you know\nnow he can laugh because the chicken's\nstill alive\nhonestly my nerves are sort of gone now\nso that was good\nusually I have a little cry\nright here on this bench is where he\ncried and Unbound like four in the\nmorning I was like I want to do this\nand then you just do it\nthe start of Crusher and the toucher\nwill be a welcome\nto Riders after\nit's gonna be a good day of course is\nrunning good and yeah it's raced There\nRose Grant a veteran in the mountain\nbike Community has announced that this\nwill be her last season racing\nI wouldn't count her out just yet some\nRiders fizzle out she only gets stronger\nthanks for making me laugh it was very\ninteresting to watch Haley Smith in this\nrace thus far she's been sitting in the\nshadows in this series but currently a\nsecond overall it begs the question is\nshe struggling or is she just playing\nthe long game\nI think a lot of women that I stand next\nto on the start line there's that\nimposter syndrome of I don't belong here\nI don't deserve to be here\nI come to Crusher being the defending\nchamp yeah I'm like freaking scared of\nthis race\nhere\nin Beaver Utah the gateway to the\ntoucher mountains as they make their way\nalong Highway 153 we can expect to see\nthe group stay pretty much together that\nis until they leave the pavement in the\nfirst climb really begins at that point\nthat is what I would expect to see a\nlittle separation beginning at the front\nof this race\nforeign\nI can settle in so well to suffering\nuphills these climbs this is going to be\nthe Difference Maker in this bike race\nand\nI like the feeling of pushing myself\nreally hard and I think you have to have\nsome bit of enjoying that to do this\nit's not easy ever\nstarting to see the path break up a\nlittle in some of our army leaders are\nbeginning to emerge of course they're\nSophia Gomez V chiffoni followed closely\nby King Smith you've got Emigrant Sarah\nStern Ruth winner all in that front\ngroup\nI think your mind gives up before your\nlegs do so I just need to make sure I'm\nalways the toughest one so now we have a\ngood look here of our leaders\napproaching the second aid station and\nit's Sophia Gomez vichafane and Haley\nSmith at the front they were able to use\nthat first climb to get out in front of\neveryone else so now it's about 30\nseconds separating our two leaders back\nto our third place Rider Sarah Sturm\nthat's your one two and three as they\napproach the long downhill section and\nthen of course they'll just go right\nback up so the most challenging sections\nof this course are still ahead of them\nmy overall race strategy is to match the\nattacks in the first half and then if\nI'm able to do that and I'm feeling\nstrong to try to insert myself into the\nrace in the second half that's where the\ncrusher really Bears its teeth\nnow coming out the bottom of the\ndownhill our top four consists of Haley\nSmith Sophia Gomez vichafane Sarah Sturm\nand Ruth Winder they'll get to enjoy a\nfew miles of pavement before they start\nthe long climb back up\ngoing into the second climb there's this\nlittle section called the sarlacc pit\nand I think it's going to be\nsoul-crushing\nthe sarlacc pit and then the cold crush\nthis is what gives the crusher in the\ntusher its name the sarlacc pit is\nbasically a four percent grade on Sand\nand then once you're through that there\nis no letting up because the colder\ncrash four miles of an average of 10\ngrade on big chunky gravel is waiting\nfor you on the other side this course is\nabsolutely ruthless coming from a\nmountain bike background I know that the\nsteep grindy climbing is a strength of\nmine as the Riders enter the Starlight\npit now it's Ruth Winder taking over the\nlead with Haley Smith Sophia Gomez\nvichafane and Sarah Sturm only seconds\nbehind her I'm still figuring out these\nraces because they're not full gas right\noff the start Sophia has exuded\nconfidence all week so you kind of have\nto see her as the favorite but all these\nRiders they are close enough together\nthat it is still anybody's day out there\nit's really going to come down to who\nhas the freshest legs because it is a\nclimb all the way to the Finish I want\nto win every race that I start and I've\nlearned through my own successes and\nfailures I focus on something like that\nI focus on getting the win and we'll get\nit crossing the top of the story like\npit now Haley Smith has taken over the\nlead and she is alone Ruth Winder is now\nin second place 30 seconds behind her\nfurther back Sophia and Sarah are\nfighting for third two minutes behind\nHaley Smith the SE is a very tough hand\nbeing dealt for Sophia the sarlacc pit\nhas nearly taken her out of contention\nfor the win and with the call to crush\ncoming up if she can't find another gear\nshe may miss out on the podium\naltogether my downfall is that I often\ngrip too tight I'm being too analytical\ntoo regimented and Haley Hunter Smith is\nhaving a day chasing all day changing\nleads with Sophia and now changing leads\nwith Ruth it'll be interesting to see\nwhat she does over the last few miles\nand it doesn't leave room for creativity\nand dreaming and optimism and all the\nMagical elements that come together to\nbuild a successful athlete here we are\nnow at the top of the cold crush and\nHaley Smith is leaving the competition\nin her dust this is now Haley's race to\nlose I'm trying to embody some of that\nenergy that the other women are bringing\nHaley is just a few miles away from\ncinching the wind here in Beaver Utah\nand the grant Ruth Winder and Sarah\nSturm are all going to be babbling for\nsecond place and Sophia has come\ncompletely fallen out of the top group\nI'm trying to be more relaxed I'm trying\nto lean into this gravel attitude all\nright here she comes wow\njust grinding it out yeah she took a\nlittle look over the shoulder just to\nsee if she's still in the clear there\nyou go\nHaley Smith nice work Haley\nladies and gentlemen your 2022 Crusher\nin the toucher Champion Haley Hunter\nSmith congratulations to Haley for an\nincredibly hard-fought win\nif I double down and I focus and I'm\nsuper regimented I can succeed for one\nweekend but that's not sustainable\nyou have to have a little bit of that\nelement of zest for life and for the\nadventure of what we're doing in order\nto make this a sustainable thing\ncoming in in second place a full eight\nminutes behind is Emma Grant and here is\nSarah Sturm climbing her way to the\nFinish she'll take third but since Emma\nisn't in the Grand Prix Sarah will get\nthose second place points towards the\nfinale\nI'm kind of trying to emulate Sarah\nSturm a little bit she's always laughing\nand very sociable\nand I think that's a really nice way to\nbe and I think it puts you in a good\nheadspace\nI just thought I was done racing I don't\nknow this\nRuth Winder hangs on for fourth place\nHannah Otto finishes in seventh and\nSophia ends up taking eighth place 29\nminutes off the lead\nlooks like she was really struggling to\nkeep the pace on that final climb which\nis a little bit of a surprise we'll just\nhave to wait and see if she is able to\nRebound in time for the next race in the\nseries The Leadville 100. I've been\nfeeling like like since Oregon like\nwe got to starlock here and I was like\nthis is not good and normally I could\nturn it on on the last hour but not this\nyear so yes so I think someone likes\nSarah who can bring more Artistry into\ntheir approach in their training I think\nthat's a huge benefit and I think it\nprobably preserves a really positive\nmental headspace which is really\nimportant for long-term success\ncongratulations to our top finishers and\nespecially to Haley Smith for her first\nPodium and first place finish in the\nGrand Prix we're now halfway through the\nsix races and suddenly the women's field\nseems a lot tighter than it did\nyesterday we'll see you all in a few\nweeks in Leadville"
