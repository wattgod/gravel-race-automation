      "transcript": "Hello and welcome back to the Wisconsin\nGravel Cyclist. This is your host Logan.\nToday we're going over the Bear 100\nHoney Bear route. This is my first race\nof the year for 2025 and it was held in\nLeon, Wisconsin. Here we are at the\nstart. Um there were, you know, a great\namount of people that came here for this\nevent. In the 31 mile race that I\nparticipated in, there are about\n140. We started off right in town at a\nlocal bar and we started on this just\nlocal walking in ATV UTV trail that had\nall kinds of bad black top and stuff all\nover it. But it was a very\nnice, you know, flat, easy start to the\nrace here for the bare 131 mile race a\nlittle, right?\nUh at the start here, we really weren't\ngoing very hard at all. We were just\nkind of rolling out. Uh this gentleman\nhere, he wanted to try to get the pace\ngoing a little bit faster. So he would,\nyou know, come in front here every once\nin a while and push the pace just a\nlittle bit. But overall, we really\nweren't pushing hard. We were just going\n15 miles an hour or so, 15, 16 m hour\nand just rolling out at the start on\nthis nice path and trail that they had\nhere for the start of the Bear 100 Bear.\nHeat. Heat.\nAnd then eventually uh David here, the\neventual winner of the bear 100 honey\nbear uh came to the front and decided\nthat we needed to get this party\nstarted. So he went to the front and\nstarted to pick up the pace, which was\ngood. At this point, little did we know,\nthere were others that were and weren't\nreally trying to stay with us here at\nthe front. So, uh, David picked up the\npace, you know, 17, 18 miles an hour,\nmaybe a little bit faster on the flats,\nand we just proceeded to start and\nrotate. Uh the two of us here, the other\ngentleman that uh we saw earlier, uh he\njust kind of sat on the back of us and\nyo-yoed a little\nbit. Heat.\n[Music]\nHeat.\nHeat. All\nright.\nAnd then what you see here is what a lot\nof the raceourse was like. It was this\nhard packed dirt road with trees and\nthick cover all around us. There were\nsome times where, you know, we had some\nuphills and different things like that\nand it was a very, very cool atmosphere\nand cool setting for a gravel race here\nin northern Wisconsin.\nthis section here where we start to go\nup some of these hills with the pines\nand birch trees uh here on the sides of\nthe road. Uh this is honestly one of my\nfavorite parts of the course. It's just\nbeautiful and really accentuates what\nyou know Wisconsin has to offer for\ngravel riding. Um these roads I would\nsay overall decent condition. Uh they\ndid have a fair amount of rain here the\nnight before. So, the roads were rather\nwet and sticky and at times a lot of\npotholes and puddles and things like\nthat. That did make it a little\ninteresting at times trying to avoid uh\nyou know trying to avoid those potholes\nand and puddles and things like\nthat. Eventually, it was just David and\nI. we were able to kind of break away\nfrom the rest of the group and a couple\nof the other riders\nand we just worked on and off together\nfor pretty much the remainder of the\nrace here. Um, at times, you know, if it\nwas a a hill or something like we're\nseeing here, he would gap me off a\nlittle bit. This was my first race of\nthe year. Didn't quite have the miles in\nthat I was expecting, but really I was\nfeeling pretty good.\nThat's weird.\nyou know, and at that point, just when\nwe thought we had uh left everyone kind\nof behind us, uh we found ourselves on a\nflat section here coming off of a\ndownhill. And our buddy in the hooded\nsweatshirt joins us here shortly.\nUnfortunately, we couldn't get him to do\nmuch work for us, though. He kind of\njust wanted to ride off to the side or\nbehind us and wouldn't, you know, give\nmuch of a draft or anything like that.\nSo, we kind of just uh got to a point\nwhere I would catch back up with David\non the flat sections like we see here,\nand David and I would end up working\ntogether again.\nAnd then eventually, you know, there\nwere a few road sections on this course.\nUm, none of them were were real very\nlong. It was definitely more gravel\nthan road in this race. Um, in this case\nhere, I'm on the front setting the tempo\nof the of the of the race. At this\npoint, it is truly just David and I at\nthe front. And we're working our way\ntowards the Bear Lake Campground here up\nby Lake Elmo,\nWisconsin.\nUpon entering the road into the\ncampground, this road was very flowy and\nfast. And again,\nthe typical uh birch and spruce trees\nthat you see here in northern Wisconsin\nin a little bit of lowland. Um, you'll\nsee here, I don't know if it shows it\noverly well, but the lake will be on our\nleft hand side here in a little bit. Uh,\nand this is actually where uh Brent\nstayed uh when he was coming up with the\nidea for the bear. Brent is the uh race\ndirector here for the Bear 100. And you\nknow, overall, this was a great event.\nVery well organized, lots of door\nprizes, good food. Um, you know, it's\nwhat you want to see in a gravel race. I\nhighly recommend getting the Bear 100,\nwhether it's the Honey Bear, you know,\nor the, you know, the actual 100mile\nversion of the Bear. I highly recommend\nyou get up to Leona to give this race a\ntry. So, again, we're going through, you\nknow, the campground route here. We turn\nleft and continue. Um, this was all\npaved and this is one of the faster\nsections of the course actually. Um, we\nwere able to roll pretty good in here.\nYou'll see here I get a little bit hot\nand heavy as we're going through here\nand I actually miss a turn. Uh,\nfortunately David's an honest guy and he\nwas able to redirect me and get me back\non course. So there were no unfair\nadvantages for anyone in this race.\nAnd then one of the final sections of\nthe race here was the Rat River Trail,\nwhich at this point I was starting to\nfeel really really tired. Um, again, I\nhadn't had many miles in my legs at all\nthis year at this point in time. So, I\nwent on the front and kind of just tried\nto slow things down a little bit. Um,\nthis trail again, they had had a lot of\nrain here over the last couple days, so\nthere was a lot of water on the trail\nand it was very, very soft and muddy in\nplaces on the Rat River Trail here. Uh,\nthis is very uh cool, unique trail. um\nthey had a lot of um trees and sticks\nand things on the course uh because of\nthe rain and wind and things that had\ncame through, you know, just general\nweather patterns here in Wisconsin in\nthe spring.\nUm but overall, the trail was in good\npretty good\ncondition. So again, I kept the pace\nslower here just to give myself a\nchance. Uh, I knew if I could keep it\nslower, I had a potential to to win the\nrace in a sprint. At this point, we\nwere, you know,\n25, 26, 27 miles into the race with only\na couple miles left on the Red River\nTrail here before we got to the end.\nAnd eventually It got to a point where I\nthink David got a little tired of going\nslower than what I wanted to in this. He\nended up uh coming around me here and\njust stayed steady. Unfortunately, I\ndidn't have any answer for this. There\nwere a couple trees and things that we\nhad to go over, but it didn't slow him\ndown any. Unfortunately, I just wasn't\nable to keep this pace with the lack of\nmiles in the legs and lack of intensity.\nSo, at this point, this is where I last\nsaw David uh in the race on the Grat\nRiver\nTrail. Uh I want to say congratulations\nto David. It was great to ride with you.\nI appreciate it. Um hopefully we'll be\nable to uh replicate this duel again\nnext year. So, again, this is Logan with\nthe Wisconsin Gravel Cyclist, uh with\nthe overview of the Honey Bear, a part\nof the Bear 100 in Lyon, Wisconsin.\nAgain, I would highly recommend this\nrace. I had a great day. I got second\nplace overall, first in my division to\nthis point in my career. My best ever\ngravel result. I'm super happy with\nthis. Glad to have been uh able to to\ncome up and give this ride a shot. Um,\nyou know, final final stats were we\naveraged right about 16 miles an hour,\nwhich isn't bad considering everything\nfelt\nlike felt like you were riding on Velcro\nwith the wet wet conditions. So, I'll\nleave you with just a couple pictures of\nthe\num the bib and the placing and results\nhere. Again, wanted to say thank you for\ntuning in to Wisconsin Gravel Cyclist.\nHave a great day. Let's go for a ride.\n2025. Thanks."
