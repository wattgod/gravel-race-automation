      "description": "Starting and finishing inside Upland Hills Farm in Oxford, MI, the De Ronde Van Grampian is a gorgeous east-side gravel race. Challenging but fun, it includes a fair amount of elevation and a section of Bald Mountain Single-Track.\nI rode about the pace I wanted but cramped on the final climb. Missed my sub-2hr finish goal by just over 3 minutes.\nAdd this one to your schedule next year, especially if you live on the east side of MI. \nPhotos of the start and finish line:\nhttps://www.cbowersphotography.com/2025-De-Ronde-van-Grampian?fbclid=IwY2xjawL9vlJleHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETFlRnc1djVUdndZdHc4UW1nAR6tUT2lqZcEPZJ32LntRKicwwXToIaD_IjuqlTJsf_IV8t0EC5blnOZFmo3aA_aem_DE4qcGBuScQjgrsMm6VZuA",

      "description": "Another long boring bike video! A great road race on the dirt roads of Oxford, Michigan. I thought I was turning the camera on/off throughout the race, but apparently not. I was surprised to see the battery lasted for most of the race, but it died during the best part - the wet two track/single track at the end. So it goes.",
