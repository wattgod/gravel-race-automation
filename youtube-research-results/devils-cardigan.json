      "transcript": "My name's Alex. I'm from\nTasmania and I'm like to ride my bike\nand pretty much anything that involves\n[Music]\npedaling. Started riding mountain bikes\nas a kid.\num and was lucky enough to get selected\nto represent Australia a couple times as\na junior and under 23 and then won the\nunder 23 national title in 2018 and then\nonce gravel riding kind of came on the\nscene got pretty into that. Um and then\nyeah went to the world championships in\n2023 for\ngravel from Arthur's river to to war. It\nwas good contrast. So there's two\nsections the western explorer and then\nwent into the snake pit from\nwarar pretty much to deline a mix of\nfire road to yeah bin long bay it's\nalways on pretty nice rubber road and\nthen once you get to ranking pretty much\nmy trails all the way to being long\nuh do a lot of indoor training\nthroughout the week and then try to get\na longer ride to over the weekend. Um\nhaving just gone over to Europe, done a\nfew longer rides just to bike.\nCastened by pebble to the shore of\neternity to be washed by the ocean of\ntime. He has shape, form, and substance.\nIt is\nme. One day I will be no more. But high\npebble will remain here on the shore of\neternity. Mute witness for the als that\ntoday I came and stood at the edge of\nthe\nworld.\nPretty much the inspiration for this\nride was PAC's ride. Um,\nin 2021, there wasn't much racing going\non, so I chose to do a challenge in\nDerby and go ride every mountain bike\ntrail in one day, which was cool. I\nthink Pac may have done something\nsimilar in the past. So then when he\ncame to Tazzy and did the crossing, it\nwas Yeah. got to do that. That's pretty\ncool. Heat up\nhere.\nand then went into the snake pit and\nthat was Yeah, there's lots of trees and\nstuff over and really wet. It's like a\nriver bed with soft gravel, soft mud and\nyeah, water and bike. Pretty much got\nstuck to these. Yeah, it's fun but hard\nand slow. Um and then yeah pop po that\nstraight into war and got to\nrefill. Yeah. Yeah.\nFrom\nWarar pretty much to Delerain with a mix\nof fire road and into some pretty\ngnarly like rough terrain.\nsome walking. Probably wouldn't even do\nit on a mountain bike. It's pretty\npretty tough. Lots of steep climbs.\n[Applause]\nand then yeah that's when it started\ngetting dark as well. So the section\njust before\nDelerain, it got dark. Didn't really\nknow what I was in for. The climbs felt\nlonger. Like when it's dark, you don't\nknow where the top is. Can't see the\ntop. So makes it harder. And then\nthere's a couple of river crossings. And\nthen yeah, finally got to Delerain\nrefill.\nGet a hit.\nYeah, you definitely feel like you're\nout there by yourself and there's no one\nelse around. Just you and couple hours\nand that interesting feeling. So, in the\nsnake pit, my first axis battery went\nflat,\nwhich I thought, it's odd. It's only\nbeen 7 hours, so shouldn't go\nflat. So, I took three. So, put my last\none in. And then that only lasted 4\nhours. Got to bless and it was pretty\ndead.\nBut\nthen, yeah, pretty much early that\nmorning, so probably 4:00 a.m. or\nsomething, the weather changed. This got\ngot really\ncold, started\nraining when I was in the\ncar thinking I'll just get warm and then\nwe'll be able to go again.\nUm and then yes kind of made the\ncall.\nYeah. I\nthink yeah it's the\nconditions about 100%. No Yeah.\nYeah.\nShould we keep you warm? Well done, man.\nYes. It's good. Yeah, that's\namazing.\nYeah. Yeah. Well done. Very proud of\nyou. It's\nThere's no other way. That was\nfun.\nAnd finally, like is the option of doing\nit all again still out there, still\nthinking about it?\nYeah, definitely. It kind of leaves you\nwith some unfinished\nbusiness.\nUm, but also, yeah, it leaves you\nwanting more. So yeah, definitely I\nthink potential for another attempt\nmaybe with yeah more daylight and better\nweather, better time of\nyear.\nLet's go. Let's\ngo. Oh, get it. Get it."
