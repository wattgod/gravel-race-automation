Payne were off\nriding The Full Monty 150 mile event and\nleft a little bit earlier to avoid the\ncrowds\nonto the first dirt which is when things\nbegin getting a little bit spicy the\nsurfaces of this event vary from\nhard-packed clay roads to gravel and\nonce in a while a tricky sandy spot I'm\ndoing my best to stick towards the front\nbut avoid going into the red zone I had\nno plans of riding the 4 100 mile\ndistance with the front group but rather\nhang out for at least 20 miles and then\nshut it down for those who are wondering\nthis was the first event where I\nofficially rode 650b wheels usually I'll\nkeep those for training or fun\nexploratory rides as you can see from\nthe video the front group isn't exactly\nhanging about it didn't take long for us\nto catch the three man gravel cyclist\ncrew who were rolling the 150 mile route\nat a much cruzi ER pace\nlike most travel events the dirty pecan\ndraws writers aboard all sorts of\nmachines including a fat bike or two in\nthese scenes are set up which is vastly\ndifferent from being dropped as my\nworkout for the day was accomplished\nnow just ride tempo and finish the ride\nso a little while I wrote with the\n150-mile lads sitting tempo for them on\nthe front until their course turned\nelsewhere\nI believe the lads in these scenes were\nfrom Alabama all of us were happy to\nride tempo until the midpoint of the 100\nmile route in Boston Georgia\nthis truck was one of the few vehicles\nspotted along the route this be one of\nthese Scindia spots of the route which\nalways causes problems for those riding\n40 millimeter wide tires or less and\nhere we have a huge smattering of gravel\nrolling into Boston Georgia for the rest\nstop this is Boston Georgia and run a\nconvenience store what the hell is that\nyou're eating there what is that there's\na chicken tender\nfried actually it's like chicken fish\nchicken are some fishery so I think it\nis well it tastes like a chicken tender\nso I'm okay with it\ntrain says from clay pride so this is\nyour first experience here at the dirty\npecan what's how's it going for you now\nStella tell us about the doc Hollywood\nwhat's it about\nI've never heard of this ride do you\npromote races Tim he promotes himself\nmost the time for the remainder of the\nride I hung out with the clay pride lads\nsenior member of the group tick Bowen\nrun a strong pace that kept everyone\nhonest and me hurting\ndirectly ahead of me is tik bowen he can\nride this solar tempo all day the rest\nof us were mostly hanging out in talking\nbollocks\nthis sandpit\naka gum Swamp Road approximately 15\nmiles from the finish blew up the group\nand my legs completely so for the\nremainder of the ride\nI rode home solo I regret to inform\nviewers that I experienced a camera\nissue which tore the loss of some\nfootage from the remainder of the ride\nwith that said this concludes the duty\npicard video for 2018 thank you for\nwatching if you haven't already please\nsubscribe to the gravel cyclists YouTube\nchannel I'll see you in the next video"
