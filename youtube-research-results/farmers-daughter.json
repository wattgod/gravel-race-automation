      "transcript": "Hey guys, good morning. Welcome back to\ntoday's video. I'm here with Jason in\nNew York and we're in specifically in\nChadam, New York. And the reason why\nwe're here is because we're actually\ndoing an event. It's called a farmer's\ndaughter's gravel grinder. We ca we got\nhere yesterday. Um it's actually only an\nhour and a half of a drive from\nuh Danberry to uh our current location.\nAnd we rented this small little house\njust to get situated for this morning.\nAnd uh it was a great day yesterday.\nToday it might not be so great.\nUnfortunately, there is a chance of rain\nand thunderstorms later on today. And\nso, most of the\nroad that we're going to be riding\nthrough is gravel. There are some paved\nroads. And we also have some trails. I\ndon't know how many miles of trails\nwe're going to be riding through. That's\nthe only thing that I'm a little worried\nabout because if it does rain, then it's\ngoing to be pretty muddy. But I really\ncan't complain since we're here and\nwe're getting ready to to start this\nevent. And uh I know there are some\npeople who probably had to pull out last\nminute due to an illness. So we're\npretty lucky in that sense. So I can't\nreally complain about um about anything.\nI'm I'm excited because it's our first\nevent together that we're doing and uh\nyeah, I really can't complain a whole\nlot.\nDon't mind what I'm doing right now. I'm\njust massaging my I was just foam\nrolling and\nuh just doing some self myofascial\nrelease. I always do this before\nuh well pretty much every morning even\nif we're not riding just because it\nmakes me feel better and looser.\nUm, yeah, I'm uh I'm both excited and a\nlittle nervous\na little nervous about the conditions\nand just this being\nthe, you know, the first time that we've\nridden with a lot of other cyclists\naround us. I'm a little especially like\nthe trail sections. I'm a little nervous\nof how that might go. Hopefully, just\nhoping for the best with the weather. it\nseems like it's it's going to be on and\noff rain um or there's periods of of the\nday where there's chance of rain and\nthen other other times when it looks\nclear. So, um, if it does rain,\nhopefully it doesn't at least doesn't\npour.\nAnd based on the what we saw from the\nroads yesterday, they were like really\nmost of them were really dry and and\nhard packed. Obviously, it won't be dry\nif they if it rains, but they were so\nhard yesterday that I'm thinking as long\nas it doesn't pour. It the the main the\nmain uh dirt roads that we ride on\nshouldn't be uh muddy. I don't think so.\nLooks like the rain has stopped. It was\npouring earlier. Um it was actually a\nnice uh way of the way it was pouring.\nKind of calm. It wasn't torrential\ndownpour or anything, but that could\ndefinitely change the conditions of the\ntrails. Um, if they decide to continue\nwith using the trails as part of the\nroute. Uh, yeah. So, Jason and I are\nheading out soon. Uh, we're going to\nhead out over to the registration area\nand, uh, just ride out there because\nit's about a mile down the road from us.\nReady? Y.\ncar up.\nOh my\ngod.\nThe Farmer's Daughter Gravel Grinder is\na non-competitive event for beginners\nand veterans of the sport that takes\nplace in Chadam, New York. The ride is\n65 miles with with an advertised\nelevation gain of 6,100 ft.\nIt runs through Colombia County's\npristine gravel and paved roads along\nwith single track sections.\nHeat. Heat.\nSo, we're here at the starting point of\nthe gravel grinder. Um, people haven't\nquite lined up yet to start. It's still\nabout 15 minutes before before we line\nup. But, uh, yeah, they got some music\nplaying. It's pretty lively lively crowd\nhere. There's a lot of lot of cyclists\nand we're getting a little intimidated\nhonestly because there's there's some uh\nsome riders around here that look like\nthey're taking it pretty seriously. Um\nso, but I told Joy, you know, let's not\nworry about that. Those those people\nwill be like sprinting off the gun and\nthey'll be like way ahead of us from the\nstart and we'll never see them again.\nSo, um hopefully we can uh find a a\ngroup that that wants to ride at the\nsame pace as we do.\nBut yeah, we're uh we're both excited\nand uh ready to get this going. Um we're\nmuddy. We're it's going to be muddy. Uh\nwe're we're kind of muddy already and\nall we did was basically ride from the\nhouse we're staying at to the event. So,\num, yeah, it's going to be uh going to\nbe a a dirty one.\n[music]\nThe ride started at 9:00 a.m. It was a\npretty relaxed [music] start. This was\nour first event. So, let me just run\nthrough what was going through my head.\nI was looking at all the bikes and tire\nchoices. Some had cyclacross tires,\nskinny with treads. Some were on\nmountain bikes, fat bikes. I just really\nenjoyed looking at everyone's bikes and\ntheir different setups.\n[singing]\nI noticed as I was looking around that\nwe were probably the only ones who had\nour jerseys stuffed with food and other\nunnecessary things. It had rained early\nthat morning, so we brought our rain\njackets thinking we might need them. But\nit was warming up as we rode to the\nstart line and it was no longer raining.\nSo, we took our rain jackets off, which\nleft us with another extra item to\ncarry.\nA damn it, my water turned off.\n[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] turns off.\nOh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] mine did too.\nWhat the hell?\nAre you kidding me?\nAll right, we're still still neutral.\nSo,\nI've been having problems with the Wahoo\nrecently with routes not loading. So, I\nwas nervous that once I turn it on to\nstart the ride, I would lose the route.\nLuckily, it loaded properly.\nI put the bus cage on that block the\nfender.\ngoing to take the fender tag off. That's\nuh cutting them off.\nSaw a fender then.\nI love those.\nThe first mile or two was a parade\naround the town of Chadam. There were\npeople out there cheering us on, but not\nlike the tour to France.\nWe noticed as we were riding, someone\nwas stopped on the side of the road,\npossibly with a mechanical. Throughout\nthe ride, we saw a few people stopped at\nthe side of the road fixing their bikes.\nThat's one thing we were thankful for.\nWe did not have any mechanicals or flats\nin this ride. Speaking of which, I want\nto just briefly talk about our bike\nsetup. This is the same setup we've had\nin our previous training rides. We have\na La Anywhere gravel bike with the Rival\nEAP one by drivetrain. The tires are the\nMaxis Felicita\n40mm tubeless setup.\nThere isn't an aggressive tread to the\ntires, but I think it held up well. Part\nof our saving grace for this event is\nthat Joy had recently cleaned the chain\nand applied a wax chain lube by Sila.\nMore about the chain lube later.\nI'm right.\nYou're fine. I'll catch you.\nWe got to the first single track\nsection. It had rained the night before\nand into the morning. This was one of\nthe things that I thought would be a\nchallenge because wet trails and bikes\ncall for a mud fest. I was able to enter\nthe single track section successfully\nand rode for a few feet until it started\nto bottleneck.\nI'm I'm going to be way behind you. I'll\njust I'll try to meet up with you on the\nother side or something.\nUp.\nIt was hard to get back on because once\nI did, I'd have to get off again. Then\npeople on mountain bikes started passing\nme. I got to the point where my Senna\nstarted beeping, indicating that Jason\nand I were over a quarter of a mile away\nfrom each other and lost connection.\nThat's when I completely stopped to wait\nfor Jason.\nYou'll be able to pass me. I'm building\nyour confidence.\nYou guys know I'll pass you later.\nExactly.\nYou okay?\nDon't get off the saddle. Whatever you\ndo,\njust stay on the saddle. People are\nfalling over here.\nKeep your gear low.\nHow do I\nthe bottle?\nThe first single track really put a\ndamper on things. The combination of\ncrowded, muddy trails and my poor trail\nriding ability really slowed us down. We\nfinally got out of it. Shoes covered in\nmud. We hopped on the bikes and rode on\ngravel and smooth paved roads. I was now\nback in my comfort zone and we picked up\nthe pace on this section and ended up\npassing some of the riders who had\npassed us on the single track. On the\npaved road, we were able to ride and eat\nat the same time, but it was still\npretty hard to do that when it's hilly.\nYeah,\nyour eyes.\nGood.\nYeah.\nOkay. So, uh we just got done with the\nfirst aid station. Um there was only one\nporta potty there. So, Jason's just\ndoing his business on the side of the\nroad here while everybody's passing us.\nYeah, it's been pretty humid actually.\nAnd um I feel like\nI I don't really know where we are in\nterms of placement. I doubt we're\nanywhere close to the front since we\ntook a little bit longer on that first\naid station. Uh I'm feeling hot. I am\nfeeling um have a hard time getting the\nfood down. U just feel a little off, but\nthat's probably because I was uh I don't\nknow. It's just kind of a there's a lot\nof things going on and it's like over\nstimulated. We are at mile 18 and we\nhave about 40 some odd miles left to go\nand there's still lots of single track.\nNeed anything?\nNo, I'm good. Thanks.\nWell, guys, I just stopped here for a\nquick nature break. It's pretty nice\nright now, but it's humid. Um, feeling a\nlittle warm. Um, the the roads are uh\nare in pretty good condition, though.\nUm, I did not like the single track. The\nsingle track section was very muddy. Um,\nbut since um getting off of that, the\nmain dirt roads have been pretty good.\nThey're just like a little bit wet and\ndamp, but not muddy. Yeah.\nUnfortunately, the uh I mean this was\nthis was expected that the bike would be\nuh be pretty muddy. My uh\nmy shoes are uh pretty pretty muddy,\ntoo. I don't know if there's any way to\nto salvage these shoes now. They're not\nreally uh they're kind of like a suede\nmaterial. So, um hopefully I can wash\nthem and they'll they'll still be\nusable. Um\nanyway, about 20 miles in to the ride\nand uh which is a little less than a\nthird of the way. Um still feeling good\nright now, but again a little bit on the\nwarm side. Um there's a chance of\nthunderstorms later this afternoon, so\nhopefully we can finish before that\nhappens.\nAs we were riding the pavement and\ngravel roads, I kept noticing that we\nwould pass other riders who passed us on\nthe single track. It seems as though\nthis was the theme of the day. They'd\nmake up ground on the technical sections\nwhile we made up ground on the paved and\ngravel roads. Even though our tires\ndidn't have the aggressive treads that\nsome riders had, I think overall it was\na good choice. It was only that first\nsingle track where we lost a lot of time\ndue to the cake batter mud and my lack\nof technical skills, but overall I think\nthe tires performed very well and\nprobably made us a bit faster on the\nroad sections.\nWhat is uh this route doing?\nLeft or right? It's right.\nI thought for sure after the first\nsingle track that we'd get mud all over\nour chain and it would be really hard to\npedal through it. I don't have a picture\nof the bike, but if you looked at the\nbike, it was caked with mud, but the\nchain was clean. Having a clean chain\nreally helped in those climbs because I\nfelt like I had zero friction and I had\nno other excuse for quitting. I was\nreally happy that that didn't give me\nany problems throughout the ride.\nSo, we got to the second single track\nsection. I came up behind a father and\nson duo who were on mountain bikes. I\ndecided to follow them through until I\nlost them. I thought the second single\ntrack was a lot more fun to ride than\nthe first because there wasn't any\nbottlenecking or thick mud to ride\nthrough. The tires rolled pretty fast in\nthe dirt, so I held on to the brakes a\nlittle to slow them down.\nIt's okay so far, honey.\nLittle slippery.\nI knew that was going to happen.\n[sighs and gasps]\nOkay, I'm done with the single track.\nI'm walking it. It's one crash.\nYep. I crashed on an uphill, so I'm\nfine. But\nI mean, you were riding that way.\nWell, I I was, but I mean, I was riding\nparts of it, but I'm kept on uh\nYou can go ahead, honey. I'm I'm just\ndone with uh I'm done with this with\nriding riding over roots and stuff.\nYeah. If I had a m if I had a mountain\nbike, it would be fine, but I'm just not\ncomfortable doing it with this bike.\nI have a little bit of knee pain on my\nmy right knee, but it's not like it's\nnot from riding. It's like when I\ncrashed one of the times, I banged it\ninto like something.\nI think it's more of like like a a\nbruise kind of pain, not it's it's not\nlike a like a joint issue.\nThis is all the clothes.\nHey, these are good roads.\nthis road is actually really good. Now\nit's it's actually dry right now.\nAt the end of the single track, we rode\nthrough a grassy plane which sent us\ndirectly to the second aid station.\nSadly, this aid station ran out of\nwater, so we had to wait longer for them\nto refill the jugs. But while we were\nwaiting for the water, we drank a can of\nCoke, which we haven't drank in years. I\nhave to admit, it was kind of\nrefreshing, and I think the caffeine\nfrom that lifted our spirits for a bit\nto help us get through the long climbs\nup ahead. As we got to another gravel\nsection, we rode past two people and\noverheard their conversation.\nOh, thank you. We're all set. Thank you.\nAre you all set?\nHoly cow again.\nPine coming up.\nCar back.\nOh, big one.\nRight.\nAnd some ice cream.\nYeah, I know.\nThe woman said something along the lines\nof, \"You know what's coming up, right?\nTunnel Hill.\" Joy looked down at the\nelevation profile and saw the graphic\npitch upward. That's when she told me\nshe was going to ease up to save her\nlegs for this climb.\nHey,\nhey, hey.\nI got to the point where my legs just\ngot tired and I started doing zone 2\npower behind an older woman whom I have\nhuge respect for. She pretty much paced\nme up the climb as I tried to recover my\nlegs in preparation for the next several\nmonths. I'll talk about this woman\nlater.\nCome\non. Come on.\nThere we go.\nAfter surviving some steep gravel climbs\nand reaching the third aid station, we\nstarted on the third single track\nsection. It was much drier and less\ntechnical than the other two, and we\nwere rolling along it pretty nicely at a\nmoderate pace because we didn't know\nwhere the trail would take us. This\nthird single track section was actually\nenjoyable for me because it didn't\ninvolve riding through mud or roots,\nwhich I struggled to keep my balance on.\nAfter a few hundred feet of pedaling, we\ngot to the steep hike a bike section.\nA guy behind us tried to ride up it. He\ngot a good gap on us until he hopped off\nthe bike.\nYeah, I'm I'm not going to try this.\nTry it, but\nmight not get back.\nOh, this must be the steep one the guy\nwas talking about.\nIf I had the mountain bike, I would try\nthis one, but\nI don't think I would make it. That's\npretty steep.\nIt's\nat least 20%.\nNowhere.\nCome on.\nThe clouds kept getting darker and\ndarker and darker\nuntil buckets of water dumped on us and\nwind blew us around. I had to take my\nsunglasses off because they're tinted\nand it was so dark that I couldn't see\nahead of me. But because I took them\noff, water was splashing all over my\nface and eyes. Even squinting didn't\nhelp. It was borderline dangerous.\nHeat.\nSo, we're riding along and still water\nsplashing at our eyes, but I figured if\nwe ride really slowly, the splashing\nwould be wouldn't be as intense. The\nrain came down to a drizzle. We got into\ntown and we saw the same woman taking\nshelter under an awning.\nAlmost there. Yeah.\nWe got to the finish line 8 hours later.\nThey had already taken down the finish\nline banner and it looked like they were\nready to close up shop. That same woman\ncame up to us and thanked us for letting\nher ride with us. She was telling us\nabout how she couldn't see her GPS\nscreen because something happened to her\nprescription contacts\nand Joy asked her if she'd done this\nevent before. She said it was her first\ntime, but get this, she did Raspatuta\nthe week before.\nShe told us how she finished dead last\non that, but we were still impressed by\nher doing big gravel events two weeks in\na row.\ncar.\nOne more\nclear.\nCar up.\nBut we still got to climb this thing.\nIt's not quite done yet.\nThat is crazy.\nI didn't want to stop before I go, you\nknow.\nI hear you\nslept already.\nYeah. I'm pretty sure there's no food.\nWoo!\nWhat's that?\nThey said all best for a hat.\nOh wow.\nI told you the finish line.\nDo we have a finish line?\nThey don't care about us.\nOh, that's a bummer.\nYeah, we don't get anything.\nOh Christ,\nyou know\nMy eyes.\nOkay.\nI'm about to just ask for see, can you\nguys drive here?\nNo, we could probably\nYeah, but I mean, we might as well just\ncuz we're so we're soaked.\nYeah. To get their car.\nDid it feel good or did it feel bad?\nOh, great.\nYeah, it felt great finishing it. It's\njust\nWell, yeah.\nStuck in the the thunderstorm.\nYeah. much more scary than\ntons of food in the\nOh, thanks.\nYou know, when going downhill, the the\nrain is just a it it gets in your eyes.\nYou can't see. We're literally like\nsquinting be able to see.\nTell you to go really slow.\nYou should put your flashes on. I'm sure\nyou did.\nYeah. Yeah. Yeah, we did.\nThere's like water flying into your\neyes. Like you literally can't see\nanything.\nSo help.\nNo, we tried. Um, it's just it's water.\nSo, it was it wasn't helping.\nWell,\nhey, thanks for that last word. It's not\ntoo far.\nYeah. Thank you so much.\nYeah, that was fun.\nThat helped me out.\nGreat job. Oh my god. Thanks for\nfollowing you guys. It's great.\nI didn't think I was going to finish,\nbut\ngreat job in that in the downpour.\nOh my god. Yeah.\nWell, we're clean and you're not. So,\nhere's the deal. [laughter]\nOh, wow. down here.\nThey said there's food inside in the\nNow, I'm going to do a video about what\nwe learned from this experience [music]\nnext time, but one thing for sure, set\naside our lack of performance from this\nand just consider the fact that there\nwere so [music] many different people\nwho did this ride. I think the real\nwinners are the ones who were able to\npush [music] their bodies despite the\ntypical stereotype of what an athlete is\nsupposed to look like. There were men\nand women who were on the larger side\nwho have the biggest disadvantage when\nit comes to the physics of climbing\nhills. [music]\nAnd they were out there hauling ass and\nputting in the work to get it done.\nThere were men and women of different\nages, older men and women who were\nhauling their ass up those climbs,\nparticularly this nice woman who rode\nwith us at the end. These are the real\nwinners. They inspired us to get up in\nthe morning, put in the work, don't\ncomplain, and just get it done.\nThank you for watching this video. If\nyou rode this event, please share your\nexperience in the comments. If you\ndidn't and want to, just do it. It's\ngoing to be brutal. It's going to be\nchallenging.\nAnd there are no rainbows and unicorns\nat the end. What you get is a huge\n[music] sense of satisfaction that you\naccomplished a feat not many people can\nsay they've done.\nSee you guys in the next [music] video.\nDon't forget to enjoy your rides.\nHeat. Heat. [music]"
