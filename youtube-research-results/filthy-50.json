      "description": "This ride is relatively short at about forty something miles, starting and ending in the small town of Blue Earth, Minnesota. Route design by JOM of Gravel Cyclist. The route heads south among rural farms, heading east and west at points, to intersect with the town of Elmore, Minnesota.\n\nMany of the rural roads, paved, gravel and otherwise in this area, are mostly flat, and a huge network of grid roads. After a little exploration just across the border in Iowa, JOM and his partner LGC, head back towards the start town of Blue Earth, Minnesota.\n\nLocals know this already, wind is a constant riding in this area, as are changes of storms, and so on. This ride happened just a few hours after a nasty series of thunderstorms, that made the gravel roads slow-going, almost velcro-like nature.\n\nBlue Earth, Minnesota:\n\"Blue Earth is a city in Faribault County, Minnesota, United States, at the confluence of the east and west branches of the Blue Earth River. The population was 3,174 at the 2020 census. It is home to a statue of the Jolly Green Giant. Additionally, Interstate 90 is centered on Blue Earth, as the east and west construction teams met here in 1978. As a tribute, there is a golden stripe of concrete on the interstate near Blue Earth.\" - https://wikipedia.org\n\nRead more about Jolly Green Giant at this link - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Giant\n\nAdditional Minnesota gravel cycling fun can be seen at the MN Gravel Enthusiasts Facebook page - https://www.facebook.com/groups/1579219505656201\n\nIn a similar vein, if you enjoy true grass roots gravel events at no cost to you, and you happen to be visiting or in North Florida, check out the long-standing North Florida Freeride Gravel Series, going into its 11th year of running in 2022.

      "transcript": "Hasha country, Hanyang Province, Wujo\nCity. Wujo number one high school, class\n12 to 6. The students are studying\nintently. In the last row of the class,\na male student is slumped over his desk.\nHe suddenly jumps up, eyes wide, and\nshouts, \"Little junior sister.\" But\nlooking at the unfamiliar scene before\nhim, the male student exclaims in\nsurprise, \"What is going on? Wasn't I\nstorming the eye of the universe\nforbidden ground with little Junior,\nsister, and the immortals? Why did I\nsuddenly appear here? Little junior\nsister Lackli died protecting me. He\nthinks to himself, I I'm in class taking\nan exam. Suddenly, someone pokes in the\nback with a pen. The friend sitting\nbehind says, \"Hey, sit down quickly.\nWe're taking a test. Did you sleep until\nyou got confused?\" He realizes it is his\nhigh school classmate, true Kuang.\nEveryone looks at him blankly, then\nbursts in a laughter. Haha, little\njunior sister. Haha. Did you sleep until\nyou became stupid? A student mocks. Must\nhave watched too many martial arts\nmovies. Haha. The school beauty and cot\ndiet sees this scene and thanks.\nAlthough my parents always want to set\nme up with him. How can this good for-no\ndandy compare to brother Vinhow? At this\nmoment, Vinhow is also snickering. This\nkind of person is basically unworthy of\nincadiet and unworthy of being a rival\nto me. Vinhow. The proctor speaks\nsternly. All right. All right. Continue\nworking. Any more noise and you won't\nfinish in time. The teacher warns\nTranmac. Tramac, you don't want to\nimprove your grades and sleep during the\nexam, but don't affect the other\nstudents doing their work. Otherwise, I\nwill ask you to leave the exam room.\nTramac thinks, \"This is my high school\nEnglish teacher. I didn't die. I was\nreborn. Return to my high school youth.\"\nThe surging spiritual power and powerful\ndivine soul in my body. All gone.\nNothing left. After a moment of panic,\nTranmack determines this is not an\nillusion. He has truly lived again. In\nmy past life, I was a dandy. Eventually\nframed by the Van family after\ncommitting suicide, I was saved by the\nDong Hoa immortal emperor. Stepped onto\nthe path of cultivation, met Little\nJunior's sister, and roamed the starry\nuniverse. He quickly decides strength is\neverything. I absolutely will not leave\nany regrets in this world again.\nMoreover, little Junior sister might\nhave also been reborn on Earth. I must\nquickly improve my strength, recover my\ncultivation, and find Little Junior\nSister. Seeing him standing there like a\nstatue, the proctor shouts, \"Hey,\nTramac, what are you still standing\nthere for? If you don't want to take the\ntest, get out.\" He smiles, \"Just what I\nwanted.\" Saying, \"So, he walks straight\nout the door.\" The classmates are\nstunned. Really not taking the test?\nWhat's wrong with Tramac? What's the\nsituation? Is he crazy? Tramac thinks,\n\"I've been reborn. These exams are\ntrivial matters. What I need to do now\nis quickly restore my cultivation.\" He\nwalks onto the campus quickly finding a\nquiet place to prepare for cultivation.\nCultivation has eight realms includingQi\ncondensation, golden core, naent soul,\nsoul formation, doubt integration,\nmahayana, tribulation, transcendence,\nand immortal venerable. In my past life,\nI was a great cultivator at the soul\nformation realm. But now I must quickly\nenter the chi conensation realm.\nMoreover, I must learn from my past\nlife. No need to advance too\naggressively, but must be steady step by\nstep. Tramax sits down under a tree to\npractice. Countless cultivation\ntechnique manuals appear before his\neyes. To build a good foundation, which\ntechnique should I choose? After a while\nof choosing, he finally picks up the\nprofound heaven soaring dragon. This\nmethod is best for new disciples to\nconsolidate their foundation. Extremely\nsuitable for my current condition.\nTranmack closes his eyes, adjusts his\nbreathing, and begins the first step of\ncultivation, guiding Chi into the body.\nNot long after, he completes the first\nstep. His eyes shine brightly,\ncompletely different from his previous\nlethargic look. Tranmax smiles and says,\n\"It only took a moment to successfully\nguide Chi into the body. Profound heaven\nsoaring dragon is indeed suitable.\" Just\nthen, and Kaduette's group walks over.\nShe asks Tranmack, \"What are you doing?\"\nVin how mocks. Did classmate Tran Mack\nperform extraordinarily and hand in his\npaper early? Others join the mockery.\nHuh? Brother How is wise? Only one girl\nstanding behind is silent. Tranmack\nrealizes it is Duong Kio. She comes from\nan ordinary merchant family, has a kind\nnature, and in the past life was always\nby his side, never leaving or abandoning\nhim. Regrettably, I didn't know how to\ncherish her back then. seeing him not\nanswer and Kotti yet shouts, \"Tran Mack,\nI'm asking you.\" Tramac calmly steps\nforward and asks, \"Duon Kio, Kio, how\nwas the exam this time?\" The girl is\nstartled, panicked inside. Tranmack\ndares to ignore and codet and talk to me\ninstead. Duon Kio replies, \"It was\nokay.\" He pats the girl's head and says,\n\"If you can get into the top 10 of\nclass, I have a secret gift for you.\"\nDuong Kio exclaims in surprise,\n\"Really?\" Her cheeks blush slightly. She\nsays shily, \"I will try.\" Tramac waves\nhis hand. \"All right, I have things to\ndo. I'm leaving first. See you in 3\ndays.\" And Kaduette is resentful inside,\nacting cold to me again. Probably just\npretending. Tranmack thinks as he walks.\nAccording to my memory, not long from\nnow, Duong Kio will face a great\ncalamity. Since I've been reborn, I\ncannot let such a thing happen again. He\nsuddenly remembers. Ah, right.\nCurrently, I'm arranged by my parents to\nstay at Incad's house. I don't want to\nstay there anymore. Tran Mack rumages\nthrough his pockets, sighing. I want to\nrent a house, but I have no money. What\nto do? He observes for a while. A flash\nof inspiration. I've got it. In the\nevening in the school park, people are\nleisurely walking to enjoy the cool air.\nTranmack lays out a few talismans to\nsell. Two middle-aged men see this and\nsay, \"Even students come out to scam.\nNow, will anyone actually be fooled\nhearing this?\" Tranmack thinks. In a\nvast sea of people, there will surely be\none or two who recognize the goods.\nSuddenly, a voice speaks up. These\ntalismans of yours. Who are they for? A\ncute and beautiful girl named Kim. Boy\nvan is squatting by tramax talisman\nstall. Looking intently, he picks up a\ntalisman and introduces. Calms the mind\nand spirit. Wards off evil and avoids\nkilling intent. Smooth sailing. Healthy\nbody? The girl immediately asks. calms\nthe mind and spirit. If someone has a\nchaotic mind, frequently speaks\nnonsense, and doesn't even recognize\ntheir closest relatives, can your\ntalisman cure it? Tramax says that is an\nimbalance of inyong. The earth's soul\nhas not returned. Modern medicine\nexplains it as neurosthenia. So using a\nspirit calming talisman is most\nappropriate. Boy then holds up that\ntalisman and asks, \"How much?\" Tramax\nsuddenly says, \"I said some harsh words\nearlier. Don't believe if the talisman\nisn't effective. The girl replies, I\nbelieve you. I'll buy your talisman. He\nimmediately states the price. Spirit\ncalming talisman is 30,000. Spirit\nclearing talisman is 20,000. The rest\nare 10,000. Just then, another girl\nrushes over shouting aggressively.\n30,000? Why don't you go rob someone?\nLuang Nom turns to her friend and\nshouts, little Van, why do you believe\neven this? These ghostly words are\nbasically nonsense to cheat money.\nKimboy Van says, \"But my grandmother's\ncondition is getting worse. There's\nreally no other way. Let's treat a dead\nhorse as a living horse.\" Tang Nom cries\nout helplessly. Little Van you. The girl\nsays, \"Seriously, Tang Nom, I've decided\neven if I get cheated, for grandma's\nsake, I have to try once.\" Boy Van turns\nto Tranmac and says, \"Sir, I'll buy this\nspirit calming talisman. I'll transfer\nvia WeChat.\" He replies, \"Considering\nyour commendable filial piety, I'll give\nyou the other talismans, too. Go home.\nStick the talisman on the patient's\nforehead. Shout activate loudly and it\nwill work.\" Kim Boy Van smiles. Thank\nyou, sir. Tang Nom threatens. If these\ntorn talismans don't work, even if you\nhide in a corner, this lady won't let\nyou off. Tranmack moves into a small\nroom. The rental isn't bad. I must seize\nthe time to cultivate. At this moment at\nthe Kim family home, Boyven has just\narrived and asks her grandfather how is\ngrandma. Elder Kim size and replies she\nhad an episode an hour ago. Dr. Lamb\ngave her a sedative injection. Recently,\nthe frequency of attacks is increasing.\nYour grandma is afraid. The girl takes\nout a stack of talismans and says,\n\"Grandpa, today I met a master outside\nand asks for a few talismans. Let's try\nthem on grandma.\" Kim Chong Wan's tone\nis a bit dispirited. Little Van, why do\nyou believe in these things too? Don't\ntorment your grandma anymore. Boy Van\ntries to persuade. Grandpa, let's try.\nWhat if it works? Grandpa size replies.\nAll right. Kim Boy Van looks intently at\nher grandmother. She holds the talisman\nand sticks it on her face, then shouts\nloudly, \"Activate.\" Seeing the old lady\nstill lying motionless. Kim Chong Juan\ngrunts. Boy van tears up. The girl says\ndisappointedly, \"Grandpa. Grandpa\ncomforts his granddaughter. Your\ngrandma's illness. Even the best experts\nin Ying Jing couldn't cure it. How could\na talisman be effective? Let it go.\nSuddenly, the talisman flashes with\nlight, then slowly disappears. A stream\nof light appears on the face of old Mrs.\nKim. Suddenly, a call is heard. Chung\nWan. The grandfather and granddaughter\nlook at the hospital bed in\nastonishment. Old Mrs. Kim slowly sits\nup, calling softly. Chung Wan. Boy Van\nhurly runs over asking, \"Grandma, do you\nrecognize me?\" The old lady smiles and\nreplies, \"You're my granddaughter. How\ncould I not recognize you?\" Kim Chun Wan\nis extremely surprised, hurriedly\nurging, \"Little Van, quick, quick, call\nDr. Lamb here.\" The doctor arrives very\nquickly. He checks carefully and\nexclaims, \"Miracle. Truly a miracle. The\nold lady has recovered.\" Boy Van is\noverjoyed. The girl smiles. Great. This\nis great. After Dr. Lamb leaves. Elder\nKim says, \"Little Van, tell me the\nprocess of buying the talisman in detail\nagain. Don't miss any details.\" The girl\nrecounts the event. Hearing this, Kim\nChong Juan instructs a high school\nstudent. You immediately mobilize all\nforces. Carefully investigate his\nbackground. I want to personally visit\nhim. Boyin immediately replies, \"Yes.\"\nAt this moment, at Tramax's place, he\nlies on the bed calculating. Phew, the\nspiritual energy on Earth is too poor. I\nstill need three more days to enter\ntheqi condensation realm. Tramac picks\nup his phone to check. In a moment, my\nmom will call me. Sure enough, the phone\nrings. Ring, ring, ring. The caller is\nlight of he presses the answer button\nand hears his mother's urgent voice.\nLittle Mac, go to Hanyong airport\nimmediately. Go with mom to Yan Jing to\nattend your grandmother's funeral. These\nwords shock Tranm. 600 years. A son\nhears his mother's voice again. He hurly\nreplies, \"I'm going right now, Mom. My\ncondolences.\" Tofuang says, \"Yes, I'll\nwait for you at the airport. Come\nquickly.\" Tramac changes clothes. Hurley\ncaught a car to leave. My mother is lie\nto Fuang, born into the Lie family, one\nof the six super families in Yanjing.\nBecause she married a father from a\ncommon background, she was expelled from\nthe family. My parents built their\ncareer from scratch, self-reliant,\nstruggling, and striving in their own\nfields. As for me, Tranmack, in the eyes\nof the Lie family, I am completely an\noutsider, someone who can be despised\nand trampled upon by anyone. I was\ntreated as a tool for a marriage\nalliance with the Nan family. Although\nthe Nan family resolutely broke off the\nengagement, Nan Kintran, she still\nsilently protected me for many years.\nBut now that I've been reborn, we will\nsettle our debts slowly. Tranmack\narrived at the airport. He got out of\nthe car and quickly went inside. Liang,\nTramac's mother, is a beautiful woman.\nShe was waiting for him ahead. Seeing\nhis mother, Tramac couldn't help but\nfeel emotional, telling himself, \"No, I\ncan't cry.\" He called out, \"Mom,\" seeing\nher son dressed neatly. She was a bit\nsurprised. Tranmack smiled and said,\n\"Haven't seen you for a few months.\nYou've become beautiful again.\" Tofuang\nwave her hand, scolding lovingly. \"Since\nwhen did your mouth get so sweet?\" He\nsmiled with narrowed eyes and replied,\n\"My mouth is always sweet. It's just you\nhaven't discovered your son's talent.\"\nShe instructed, \"When we get to Yin\nJing, cow a few more times before your\ngrandmother's coffin.\" As she spoke, she\nrubbed her son's head. Tramac thought to\nhimself, \"Le family of Yin Jing, here I\ncome.\" The plane quickly landed at\nYanjing airport. Lie to Fuang and her\nson arrive at the outskirts of Yanjing.\nAt the Lie family estate, many people\nhad already arrived to attend a funeral.\nLaida Fang and her son stood before the\ngate of the mansion. Butler Uncle Fuk of\nthe Lie family upon seeing the two\nimmediately asked, \"Fourth miss, why\nhave you come here?\" Tranmac thought\nlooking at Uncle Fuk's unpleasant\nexpression. I know the Lie family\ndoesn't welcome us. Lie to Fuang\nseriously said, I came to see my mother\noff on her final journey. How could I\nnot come? He replied, this old servant\ndares not say much about other matters.\nonly that your visit this time I fear\nwill encounter many obstacles. She\ncalmly said, \"A daughter coming to see\nher mother is a matter of heaven's law\nand earth's principle. No one can stop\nme.\" Saying that, she held her son's\nhand and walked straight inside. Looking\nat the scrutinizing gazes of the\nmourners, Tranmack thought, \"In my past\nlife, I was scared into subservience by\nthese malicious looks, but now this\nentire life family is nothing but ants\nin my eyes.\" The lie family patriarch\nLie Dong Duong sat on a chair beside the\ncoffin. He looked at lie defang and her\nson without saying a word. Tramax's\neldest uncle lie lap van opened his\nmouth to ask fourth sister why did you\nreturn? She seriously replied since\neldest brother still calls me fourth\nsister. Then you shouldn't ask this\nquestion. Tranmax second uncle liap vo\nlet out an angry cold snort. Lapan said\nthis since fourth sister has arrived\nthen go in and see mother's face one\nlast time. Tofuang politely replied,\n\"Thank you, eldest brother.\" But he\nreached out his hand to block Tramac,\nloudly saying, \"Stand still.\" Tofuang\nquestioned, \"He is my son, mother's\neldest grandson. How is he an outsider?\nCould it be that only the three sons and\none daughter of second brother's family\ncount? Anyone not in the family tree is\nan outsider?\" Lap Vo gritted his teeth\nand replied, \"Without being entered into\nthe family genealogy, they are all\noutsiders. with me here. Don't even\ndream of him stepping half a step into\nthe morning hall. Lie to Fuang's face\nturned pale, she exclaimed in shock.\nBrother Tranmax little aunt lie lap gone\nhardly stepped up to mediate. Fourth\nsister, if you make a scene like this,\nhow can mother rest in peace? We sisters\nwill be branded as unfilial. Lap Van\ntook the opportunity to say, \"Youngest\nsister is right. If you make father\nunhappy, I fear.\" Tofuang suppressed her\nanger and replied, \"I understand.\" She\nsaid to her son Tumac, \"Grandmother\nloved you most when she was alive. Since\nthey won't let you in, just stay at the\ndoor of the morning hall to send her off\non her final journey.\" Tranmac\nimmediately replied, \"Yes.\" He knelt\ndown, cowtowing towards his\ngrandmother's morning hall. Night fell\nand the moon rose high. Live said,\n\"Aunt, you just stay here and rest\ntonight. I'll go arrange accommodation\nfor my cousin.\" Toflong blurted out,\n\"Just let you, Max, stay with me. No\nneed for the trouble.\" He pretended to\nexplain principles. Aunt father\ninstructed that the younger generation\nhas their own place. Etiquette cannot be\ndisordered. She hesitated a bit, but\nTran Mack quickly comforted his mother.\nMom, don't worry. I'll be fine. Liveette\nsmiled smugly to himself. He led Tran\nMack to a row of old houses. He thought\nto himself, I know this is the\nwarehouse. In my past life, I was locked\nin here by you live family descendants\nand nearly beaten to death. Lie Viet\nsaid, \"You sleep here tonight?\" Tranmack\nasked bluntly, \"Is the lie family so\npoor that you make guests sleep in a\nwarehouse?\" He threw the key on the\nground, replying scornfully, letting you\nstay in the warehouse is already giving\nyou face. Saying that, he turned and\nwalked away. Tranmax secretly channeled\nhis true energy and the key flew into\nhis hand. Just wait and watch the show.\nAt midnight, a group of people marched\nto the warehouse. Liviet gave the key to\nthem to open the door. Just as they\nstepped in, they heard Tranmax's voice.\nFinally, here come on in. Liveette\npushed Hugh Trang and Hugh Duong's\nbacks. Go in. The three men walked in\naggressively. Suddenly, they froze.\nSeeing Tran Max sitting leisurely on a\nchair, asking, \"What do you people want\nto do?\" Lie Viet laughed coldly. \"I have\nto let you know the price of humiliating\nthis young master.\" He ordered his\nlackey. Get him. Just don't beat him to\ndeath. They rushed up holding steel\npipes. Tranmack pondered for a moment,\nthen suddenly threw a punch, hitting one\nguy in the face. Next, he added a kick\nto the chest of the guy next to him. Two\nguys collapsed immediately. Tramax stood\nup, gently dusting off his clothes. Live\nViet exclaimed, \"You have some skill. No\nwonder you dared to be arrogant and\nfearless. But I will show you what true\nstrength is.\" He channeled his internal\nenergy. The aura emitted was quite\nfrightening. Tramac was slightly\nsurprised. Spiritual power. You are too\nweak. This can at most be considered\nspiritual chi. I didn't expect there to\nbe immortal cultivators on earth right\nnow. Tu truang cried out. I didn't\nexpect brother viet to be a marshall dao\npowerhouse. Tu duong added. Looking at\nthis posture, surely it's external realm\ngreat achievement. Hearing these words,\nTramac thought. Marshall Dao powerhouse.\nExternal realm great achievement. Lieut\nswung his fist rushing to attack.\nBastard go to die. Tramac was not afraid\nat all. He stood there silently, gently\nraising his hand to block the blow. Live\nscreamed, \"What?\" Before he could react,\nhe was thrown to the ground by Tranmack.\nA loud bang rang out. Live cried out in\npain. \"Uh uh.\" He stepped on his chest\nand asked, \"This is what you call your\nstrength?\" Hugh Trang yelled, \"Tran\nMack, release brother Viet immediately.\"\nTranmac calmly replied, \"Release him?\"\n\"Fine.\" But before the words were\nfinished, Tranmack raised his foot and\nstomp hard on his stomach. Leave it how\nmeal ah you dare to my dant on.\nI won't let you off even as a ghost.\nTramac laughed coldly. Don't rush. The\ngood show is just beginning. The\nlackeyis carried Lie Via back. Lap Van\nand his wife led their son to cry before\nLie Dong Duong. He asked coldly what\nhappened. lie lap van cried and\nrecounted father li had his dantion\ncrippled by fourth sister's bastard\nsonet\nanim daring to be so vicious he ordered\nlapvo quickly take people to capture\nTramac and your fourth sister back here\nlapvo immediately replied yes father as\nsoon as the words were spoken's voice\nwas heard no need I'm already here the\nlive family members were full of\nindignation clamoring to cursemac truly\ndoesn't life from death. Indeed, a\nbastard of a different surname. Oomph,\nsee how he dies. Lap Vo thought, \"This\nbrat is really bold, daring to bring\nhimself here alone.\" Mong deep cried and\nwailed. \"Lieette is your cousin. How\ncould you bear to be so vicious\nnow?\" Tranmac looked indifferent as if\nhe didn't hear his words. Lie Dong\nDuong&lt;unk&gt;s face turned ashen, repeating\nonce more, \"Kneel down.\" Tranmax\nsolemnly replied, \"I, Tranmack, act with\nintegrity all my life, worthy of heaven\nabove and earth below. Where am I\nwrong?\" The Lie family members roared.\nArrogant and ignorant. Don't know life\nfrom death. No respect for elders.\nYou are a member of the Lie family. Yet\nyou dealt such a heavy hand to your\ncousin and you still don't know you're\nwrong. Tranmack questioned the lie\nfamily. Now you consider me a member of\nthe lie family. I don't care for it. Lie\nlap. Van turned to accuse him to his\nfather. Father, you see this animal has\nno respect for elders. Resolutely admits\nno fault. Please seek justice for lie\nviet. Lie dong duong ordered. Bring the\nfamily law. Hearing her father say this.\nLiapgone thought, \"Oh no, Tramac will\nlikely be carried out of the lie\nfamily's main gate.\" Lap van and his\nwife secretly rejoiced. Animal serves\nyou right. Tramac, you treated my son\nlike that. You were dead for sure. Just\nat this moment lied to Fuang ran in. She\nhurly stopped them. Wait, eldest brother\nTumac is not a malicious person. There\nmust be a misunderstanding in this. Lup\nvan was furious. Misunderstanding.\nFourth sister. Your own nephew is lying\nhere covered in blood. His life\nuncertain and you tell me it's a\nmisunderstanding. Lie to Fang still\ndidn't believe her son would beat\nsomeone without reason. She turned to\nask Humac what exactly happened? Tramac\nreplied, \"Mom, do you feel that these\npeople will they believe my\nexplanation?\" Tofuang said, \"I\nunderstand what you mean, but justice\nlives in people's hearts. You explain\nthe matter clearly. Let everyone here\njudge.\" Tramac thought, \"Mom still has\nillusions about the live family's\nmorality.\" \"Fine, I can ignore others\nwords, but I can't ignore mom's words.\"\nHe grabbed Chu Chuang by the collar and\ndragged him out. Q Truong screamed in\npanic. \"What are you doing? Let go. Let\nme go.\" Tramax said, \"Let him speak for\nme.\" He saw the whole thing clearly.\nThen let him speak. Didn't he go with\nliat? He sat down next to Chu Trong,\nscaring him until his hair stood on end,\nstuttering. You What do you mean? Tramac\nlooked straight into his eyes and said,\n\"Recount everything you know exactly as\nit happened. Not half a word of lie.\"\nChuch Trong immediately replied, \"Ah, it\nwas it was Lie Viet who said he wanted\nto teach the bastard Tranmack a lesson.\nSlap the shameless woman lie to Fuang so\nthey wouldn't dare come to the Lie\nfamily again.\" He said he had arranged\nfor Tranmack to stay in the warehouse\nand told us to bring people to help just\nas long as we didn't beat him to death.\nWe just went along. I didn't expect\nTranm to fight so well. Livia used all\nhis strength but ended up being crippled\ninstead. Hearing these words, Lafang was\nshaking with anger. She gritted her\nteeth and said, \"Eldest brother, this is\nthe good son you raised.\" Mong deep\nargued unreasonably. Even if Lie Viet\nmisspoke, Tranax shouldn't have been so\nvicious. Moreover, where was Live Viet\nat wrong? You did that thing back then.\nAre you afraid of others talking about\nit? Tofuang shouted, \"Sister-in-law,\"\nTranmurly stopped her mom. \"Mom, don't\nbe rash.\" To Fang coldly asked, I only\nhave one question. If the person lying\non the ground right now was my little\nMac, \"What would you do, father?\" She\nturned to ask her father. \"Father, would\nyou use family law?\" Tramac thought to\nhimself, \"Mom asked a great question.\nLet's see how Lie Dong Duong answers.\"\nEveryone waited for the answer from the\nlie family patriarch. He said bluntly,\n\"No, he is not a member of my lie\nfamily. The life and death of an\noutsider. Is it worthy of my life family\ninvoking family law?\" Tofuang laughed\ncoldly. Clear enough, heartless enough.\nSo, how does the live patriarch intend\nto handle today's matter? He said,\n\"Blood for blood.\" Lrammac up first.\nWait for lie viat to wake up, then we'll\ndeal with it. Lida Fuang retorted. What\nif I say no\nday? She spoke loudly. What do I have to\nfear? He was furious. Unfilial daughter.\nJust as he was about to raise his hand\nto slap Lid Fang. He was blocked by\nTranmack. The live family members roared\naudacious presumptuous lap. Vo drew a\ngun and threatened. Dared to act rashly\nagain. And I'll shoot you dead. Lie to\nFang stopped him. Lil Mac. Let go\nquickly. Tranax suddenly noticed the two\nold men behind lie dong duong thinking\nto himself those two auras can actually\nthreaten me. The lie family is indeed\nnot as simple as it looks on surface.\nBut the dignity of a spirit\ntransformation realm great cultivator\ncannot be violated by others. In my past\nlife I was powerless. In this life if I\nlet my mother suffer humiliation again I\nwould be his son in vain. Trax shouted\nloudly. I was the one who hit him. If\nyou're not convinced, come at me with me\nhere today. No one can touch a single\nhair on my mother's head. Otherwise, I\ndon't mind letting your lie family\nchange to a new master. Saying that he\nchanneled his internal energy, a\npowerful force shaking the space. Liap\nVo was terrified. Tranmac is an internal\nrealm martial artist. Lie Dong Duong\ncouldn't believe his eyes. He is an\ninternal realm martial artist. At this\nclose distance, if he wants to kill me,\nno one can save me. What on earth is\ngoing on? Lapcon hurriedly advised,\nTramac, let go quickly. How can you be\nso rude to your grandfather? Tramack\nreplied, grandfather. When I was born,\nbullied and humiliated by others. Where\nwas grandfather? When I was surrounded\nand beaten by Lie Viet's men, where was\ngrandfather? He threw Lie Dong Duong's\nhand aside, declaring loudly this\ngrandfather. I, Tramac, do not\nacknowledge. Just then, Lie stepped out.\nHe was the eldest son of Li Lap Van Lie\nViet's biological brother, the eldest\ngrandson of the Lie family. Li spoke\nloudly. Even if you have thousands of\nreasons, 10,000 excuses, grievously\ninjuring a fellow clan brother is\ninhumane. Refusing to repent is unjust.\nHumiliating the live family is disloyal.\nRebelling against superiors is unfil.\nYou open your mouth to say the live\nfamily is unfair to you. But in reality,\nyou are the inhumane, unjust, disloyal,\nand unfil rebellious son. Tramac laughed\nloudly. Huh? Have you forgotten? My\nsurname is Tran, not lie. Those words\nsound reasonable, but in reality, they\nare complete Lierake\nthreatened. If you're not a member of my\nlie family, don't mention your\nbiological mother's Hoa group. Even the\nentire trans family in good duong. My\nlie family can easily wipe out. Transmac\nwas fearless. countering your live\nfamily. In the eyes of I, Tranmack is\nnothing but ants. He still wanted to use\nhis silver tongue to persuade Tramac.\nKid, the internal situation of the live\nfamily is not as simple as you imagine.\nConsidering your extraordinary talent,\nif you kneel down and admit your mistake\nright now, perhaps grandfather will\ncherish your talent and make an\nexception to let you enter the family\ngenealogy. Otherwise, within 5 years,\nthe entire Tran family in G Duong will\nvanish into smoke. Tran Mack tilted his\nchin up and said, \"To make me, Tran Mac\ncow and admit fault, your live family is\nnot worthy. I can also guarantee you\nwithin 3 years, I will make the live\nfamily kneel at my feet in heartfelt\nsubmission, begging for forgiveness.\"\nLeon Jun spoke up and now that's it for\ntoday's matter. From today onwards, the\nlie family will consider the Mihoa group\nand the Tran family in Gdu Wong as our\nbiggest competitors. Lie to Fuang was\nsecretly alarmed. This is bad. Tranmack\nheld his mother's hand and said, \"Let's\ngo. This heartless and unrighteous place\nmakes one sick.\" She lowered her head,\nfrowning slightly. There is no room for\nnegotiation anymore. What mom needs to\ndo now is to go all out to keep the Myoa\ngroup. The two immediately left, leaving\nbehind the sky-high rage of a live\nfamily crowd. The scene changed. Lidang\nand Tranmack returned to Vucha. After\ncomforting his mother, he returned to\nSaitang, went to the antique market,\nintending to buy a few pieces of jade to\nset up a spirit gathering array. He\ndidn't need to choose or appraise\ncarefully. He only needed to use his\ndivine sense to sense if the jade\ncontained heaven and earth origin\nenergy. Tranmack walked around once.\nUnfortunately, there wasn't even a\nsingle piece of jade containing heaven\nand earth origin energy here. He\nsuddenly saw a few very valuable items\non an old man stall by the roadside.\nTramax sat down to look for a while,\nthen asked, \"How much is this pair of\njade lions?\" Tran tongue too replied,\n\"1,000.\" He asked again, \"What about\nthat painting?\" The old man replied,\n\"2,000.\" Tramac looked at the blue stone\nin the corner, said, \"Oh.\" And asked,\n\"Then how much is this stone?\" Tran\ntongue too said, \"That is something I\npicked up on a mountain. If you want it,\nI can give it to you, but you must tell\nme what use does this stone have.\"\nTranmac thought to himself. I was\nalready very careful. I didn't expect\nhim to still spot a clue. This stone\nlooks very ordinary on the outside, but\ninside it contains huge heaven and earth\norigin power. He replied, \"Frankly, I\ncan tell you the use of this stone, but\nyou must tell me where you found this\nstone.\" The old man picked up the stone\nand handed it to Tranmack. then said\ncautiously, \"This is probably not the\nplace to talk. Follow me.\" Tramax\nsmiled, rejoicing in his heart. \"This\none stone is enough for me to set up the\nspirit gathering array. The rest can\nwait until I break through to the second\nlevel of chi condensation to make a few\nsimple protective jade pendants.\" Tran\ntongue too led Tranmack to his wooden\nhouse. He poured two cups of tea and\nsaid, \"All right, tell me what exactly\nis the use of this stone.\" Tramax sat\ndown on the chair and began to explain.\nThis stone contains heaven and earth\norigin power. It has no great effect on\nordinary people, but for those who\ncultivate the Marshall Dao, it has\nmiraculous effects. Old TR exclaimed,\n\"Could it be that you are a Marshall Dao\ncultivator?\" Tramac replied, \"That's\nright.\" The old man stood up abruptly\nand said, \"My master worshiped martial\nartists all his life, but unfortunately\nnever got to meet one. I originally\nthought there were no martial artists in\nthe world. I didn't expect to witness\none with my own eyes today. I found this\nstone by the Blackwater Pond on Spirit\nMarshall Mountain. There are many more\nstones of this type around the\nBlackwater Pond, but I didn't dare to go\ndeep in because the locals have a legend\nthat there are monsters in the\nBlackwater Pond. Tranmack was a bit\nsurprised. He immediately asked,\n\"Monsters? Have you seen them with your\nown eyes?\" Tran tongue too replied, \"I\nhaven't. But whenever I get close to the\nshore of the Blackwater pond, I feel a\nwave of cold air rushing towards me,\nmaking me dare not take another step.\"\nTranmac thought to himself, \"It seems\nthere must be something I need in this\nblackwater pond.\" He suddenly asked, \"Do\nyou want to become a martial artist?\"\nOld Tran exclaimed, \"I can I? Isn't it\nsaid that cultivating the martial Dao\nrequires aptitude and roots, and one\nmust start before the age of 16?\"\nTranmax smiled and replied, \"If I say\nyou can, then you can.\" Tran Tongue too\nhurriedly clasped his hands and said,\n\"Please, senior brother, introduce me.\nIf I can join the master's sect, I will\ndefinitely etch this great kindness in\nmy heart forever.\" Hearing these words,\nhe hurriedly said, \"Senior brother, you\nmisunderstood, Tran Mack chneled his\ntrue energy to slice off a corner of the\ntable, then said, \"The path of\ncultivation goes against the heavens.\nSeniority is not based on age but on\nstrength. The old man was extremely\nshocked. Internal realm martial artist\npalm striking like a knife cutting iron\nlike mud. I have eyes but failed to see\nnot recognizing the true master.\nAshamed. Ashamed. Having said that, Tran\ntongue two knelt on the ground. Master\nabove please accept a bow from your\ndisciple. Tranmax sat on the chair and\nreplied, \"You are not yet qualified to\njoin my sect. For now, just be a\nregistered disciple.\" Old Tran said,\n\"Disciple obeys.\" He instructed again in\na few days I will come to find you again\nand pass on the cultivation technique to\nyou. Joining my sect doesn't have too\nmany taboos. When I am not present, you\ncan do as you please. Tran tongue too\nclasped his hands and said, \"Disciple\nobeys.\" After Tranmack left, he muttered\na bid in his heart. I actually forgot to\nask what the name of that registered\ndisciple is. Oh well, I'll ask next\ntime. He brought the stone home, placed\nit on the table, gathered chi in his\npalm, and shouted, \"Open.\" The stone was\nimmediately cut into five small pieces.\nTranmac began to deploy the spirit\ngathering array form. Rays of brilliant\ngolden light dazzled the eyes. The small\nstones flew around him, then embedded\nthemselves into the floor. He looked at\nthe spiritual energy gathering on the\nceiling, smiling. Good. With the spirit\ngathering array, my cultivation speed\ncan increase significantly. At this\nmoment at the Yin family villa, Yin\nQuinton was standing by the window\nlooking into the distance. Tang Tang\nwalked in to report. Miss, the family\nmeeting just ended. They decided to\nbreak off the engagement with the Tran\nfamily. You and Tramac. The girl replied\nwith a serious expression. The future of\nI, Yin Quinton, lies in my own hands. No\none has the right to decide for me. Tang\nTang, go prepare a bit. We're going to\nsite Tang immediately. Tang Tang was a\nbit worried. But miss, leaving the Yen\nfamily will be dangerous for you.\nQuinton said, \"If it's just ordinary\nrich kids, you alone can handle them. If\nthe strength is extraordinary, don't we\nstill have an internal realm martial\nartist sitting in command?\" Tang Tang\nexclaimed, \"Will he help us? After all,\nby then you and he will have broken off\nthe engagement.\" Quinton smiled and\nsaid, \"As long as we go find him,\nwhether to help or not is not up to him\nto choose.\" The night in Saitang was\nbrightly lit. The spirit gathering array\ncontinuously absorbed spiritual energy.\nTranmack sat cross-legged cultivating,\ncharging towards the first level of\ntheqi condensation realm. He thought to\nhimself, \"Thanks to the spirit gathering\narray, I entered theqi condensation\nrealm 2 days early. At this speed, in 10\ndays, I will definitely be able to enter\nthe second level ofqi condensation,\nturning spiritual power into a sword. I\nmust consolidate my strength and\nstabilize my foundation. Tranmack\ncontinued to refine, racing against\ntime. The next morning, Tranac packed\nhis books to go to school. Tomorrow was\nthe day to receive report cards and also\nthe day the Yin family would come to\nbreak the engagement. In my past life, I\nwas always a joke. But in this life,\nsuddenly the phone rang. Why is she\ncalling me so early in the morning? Is\nshe in some trouble?\nNo. Today my family's eery opens. My\nparents told me to invite a few\nclassmates to be the first batch of\ncustomers to try the food for free. My\nfamily runs a common ery, a place where\nvendors often come to eat. So I didn't\ninvite Trinaw and Kadet. You can come\nwith peace of mind. It won't be awkward\nfor you. Tramax said, \"Okay, what time?\nI'll be there on time.\" The girl happily\nreplied, \"11:30 at noon. I'll send you\nthe location later. You must come.\"\nTramac cheerfully said, \"Yeah.\"\nAt noon, Tramac took a taxi to Tuong\nDao's ery. The girl was already waiting\nat the door. Seeing Tranm get out of the\ncar, she ran over and said, \"You finally\ncame. I was only waiting for you.\" Annie\nTuong came out from inside and asked,\n\"Da Dao, is this Tranmack? I've been\nhearing you chirp in my ear all morning\njust like a little speaker.\" Tranmack\nclasped his hands and wished, \"Hello,\nAnnie. I wish you prosperous business.\nMoney flowing in like water.\" Annie\nTuong couldn't close her mouth from\nsmiling. This boy really knows how to\ntalk. No wonder my Dao Dao keeps\nmentioning you all the time. Tuong Dao\nshily pushed her mother inside. Mom,\nMom, hurry and go do your work. Go\nquickly. My friends are about to star to\ndeath. Her mother laughed and replied,\n\"Okay, okay, okay.\" Haha. Tranmack took\nout a red envelope from his chest,\nthinking to himself, \"It intended to\ngive the lucky money.\" After saying,\n\"Congratulations. What should I do now?\"\nGiving it to Dao Dao. She definitely\nwon't accept it. He placed the envelope\non the cashier counter. Just quietly\nleave it here then. Tuong Dao led Tran\nMack to the dining table where several\nyoung men were already sitting. The\ngirls said comfortably, \"Tran Mack,\neveryone here is a classmate. Just make\nyourself at home.\" The guys seemed quite\ndispleased, their expressions saying,\n\"Tran Mack, this piece of trash dares to\ntouch Da Dao. He deserves to die.\" They\nlooked at Tranmac with the eyes of love\nrivals. Truang pulled him into the chair\nnext to him. \"Tran Mac, sit here.\"\nTramac cheerfully replied, \"Okay.\" Tong\nDao said, \"You guys just talk. I'll go\ncheck if the food is ready.\" Vong Loy\nsaid, \"Da Dao, don't busy yourself.\nHurry and find a place to sit down.\nEveryone is waiting for you to come out\nand talk.\" The girl smiled and replied,\n\"All right, then I'll sit down and talk\nwith everyone.\" Tru Kuang reacted very\nquickly, immediately standing up and\nsaying, \"Da Da, you sit in my seat. I'll\ngo sit over there.\" She blushed and\nreplied, \"Okay, thank you, True Kuang.\"\nAt this moment, True Kuang threw Tran\nMack a look. You owe me a favor.\nTranmack glanced sideways at him,\nreplying, \"Who wants that favor of\nyours?\" Seeing this scene, the young men\nsitting on the other side felt indignant\non his behalf, wanted to find a chance\nto humiliate Tranmack. Chu Sam suddenly\nasked, \"Right, Chu Hao, today Tuong\nDao's family eery opens. What\ncongratulatory gift did you prepare? The\nfortune tree at the door was given to\nDao Dao by me.\" He suddenly asked,\n\"Classmate Tranmack, surely you didn't\ncome empty-handed,\" Chuha asked with a\ncold, mocking laugh. \"Or perhaps, how\nmuch lucky money did you give? 500?\n1,000?\" Upon hearing this, the\nsurrounding classmates excitedly laughed\nout loud. Haha. Tru Kuang was startled,\npanicked, and turned his head to say,\n\"Tran Mack, say something. Tranmack, on\nthe contrary, had no reaction, still\nleisurely drinking tea.\" The next\nsecond, Tuong Dao spoke up to resolve\nthe situation today. I just want to\ngather everyone to chat. Friends who\nhave the heart to give gifts, I thank\nyou. Friends who don't give gifts, I'm\nalso very grateful that you came to\nattend. Let's stop this topic here.\nHearing Tuong Dao say this, all the boys\ngritted their teeth, their hearts full\nof discomfort and annoyance, secretly\ncursing to think a girl has to smooth\nthings over for a piece of trash. Tramac\nput the water glass down on the table,\nthen coldly asked Chu Hao, \"You\nprovoking me? Is it because you feel I'm\neasy to bully?\" Shuha maintained his\ncontemptuous smile, calmly replying,\n\"Just a piece of trash like you. Are you\neven worthy of my provocation? Huh? Are\nyou worthy?\" Hearing these words, Tuong\nDao immediately jumped up, shouting\nunhappily, \"Enough, Chuha. If you\ncontinue to talk to a classmate like\nthat, then please take your gift back\nhome.\" Seeing her attitude, Chua\nimmediately put on a smile and replied,\n\"Okay, okay, okay. I won't say anymore.\nDoubt, doubt. Don't be angry.\" However,\nthe next second, his eyes became gloomy,\ncalculating with resentment. Humph. Wait\nuntil I successfully woo you. See how I\ndeal with you. Tramax seemed to have\nrealized something, wondering. He dares\nto have improper thoughts about Tuong\nDao. The next second, he was ready to\nstrike. Chu Hao, shut up then go die. At\nthis moment, Tuong Dao&lt;unk&gt;s mother\nsuddenly walked and holding a red\nenvelope, asking curiously, \"Doubt Dao,\nwhose gift money is this?\" Tuang Dao\nheard this and replied, \"Let me see.\"\nOpening the envelope, inside was a thick\nstack of money, causing her to be\nextremely stunned and astonished,\nexclaiming, \"So much.\" Everyone present\nseemed to be no exception, all\ndiscussing in panic. so much? Who gave\nit? Tuong Dao turned to Tranmack, asking\nin confusion. Tranmac, was it you?\nTranmac didn't answer, just sighed. Then\nthe force in his palm also slowly\ndissipated. He scratched his head,\nsmiling awkwardly. Just a small token.\nTuong Dao's mother immediately returned\nthe envelope, saying, \"This is too much.\nIt won't do. How about this? I'll accept\none bill. Your intention is good\nenough.\" Da Dao returned the surplus\nmoney to Tramac. Tuong Dao obediently\nreplied, \"Yes.\" She returned the money\nto Tranmac while saying, \"Trrammac, I\nunderstand your heart. Just listen to my\nmom and take it back.\" He took back the\nenvelope, smiling and replying. \"Then\nI'll listen to Andy.\" Tuang Dao's mother\nbeamed with a bright smile, saying\nhappily, \"That's the way. Come on.\" Kept\neveryone waiting long. Let's serve the\ndishes. A table of sumptuous food was\nbrought up. True Kuang glanced at those\nclassmates, asking loudly with full\nconfidence. who just said Tramac didn't\ngive a gift. He hearing this, everyone\nimmediately laughed loudly to pass the\nmatter over, shifting their gaze\nelsewhere. Chuhow was full of resentment\nin his heart, angry to the point his\nface turned green, his whole body\ntrembling, thinking, \"This dog surely\ndid it on purpose. You just wait for\nme.\" Thinking of this, Chua immediately\nstood up abruptly, saying, \"Everyone\njust eat first. I'm going to the\nrestroom for a bit.\" Having said that,\nChua stormed out. Everyone had puzzled\nexpressions. Did Chuhal lose face?\nIgnore him. Let's hurry and eat. They\nwere all classmates. Why fuss over such\nsmall matters? Let bygones be bygones.\nTranmack looked calm, putting food in\nhis mouth while thinking. I know what he\nwent to do. He want to make a phone\ncall, finding people to cause trouble to\nsalvage his face. Huh, stupid indeed.\nJust as he thought, Chuha was sitting in\nthe restroom calling for help. Everyone\nwas in high spirits, sitting at the\ndining table, chatting. So delicious.\nThe cooking skills are great. I'll come\nhere to mooch a meal tomorrow, too.\nSure, just at this moment. Tran-ho\nsuddenly walked in, looking fierce and\nevil, shouting impatiently, \"Where's the\nboss?\" Chu Hao, sitting to the side, saw\nTruan Ho and immediately smiled coldly\nwith excitement. In contrast, the others\nwere full of panic. Tuong Dao said\nsoftly, \"Today, our shop isn't serving\noutside guests. How about you big\nbrothers go to another shop to eat?\"\nSeeing Tuong Dao, Tron-ho&lt;unk&gt;'s group\nimmediately rushed over to tease. Oh my,\nthere's a juicy little sister here.\nCome, come over here and chat with\nbrother a bit. Tuang Dao's mother saw\nthis scene and immediately shouted, \"Who\nare you people? What do you want?\"\nTron-ho turned around, looking at her\nsuspiciously. \"You are the owner of this\nshop?\" Tuong Dao's mother replied, \"Yes,\nmay I ask what business you have?\"\nHearing this question, Tron-ho's group\nlaughed excitedly, saying, \"No business,\nbrothers. Tell her what we need. You\nguys really don't know who protects the\nfront of this street? A minion of\nTrong-Ho smiled sinisterly, introducing\nextremely arrogantly. It's Brother Hoe.\nThis street is protected by Brother Ho.\nUnderstand? Tron-ho said loudly. Want to\ndo business here? You must follow my\nTron-ho's rules. Tong Dao's father asked\nsuspiciously. What do you want? Trong-ho\nsnapped his fingers, smiling and\nreplying. My rules, 30 million a year,\nguaranteeing you guys do business in\npeace. Hearing this, Tong Dao's mother\nwas extremely angry, immediately\nretoring. Are you guys robbing? Don't\neven dream about it. We're in illegal\nbusiness. A minion brought a chair over\nand even helped Tron-ho light a\ncigarette. Tron-ho smoked while leaning\nback in the chair, looking majestic,\nasking loudly. Saying it like, \"That\nmeans you guys don't want to pay.\" Tuong\nDao's mother was so angry her face\nturned black, gritting her teeth. her\nwhole body trembling as she said, \"Pay\nmy.\" However, the next second, Tuong\nDao's father immediately stopped her.\nIt's not that we won't pay. It's just\nthat the number is a bit much. We don't\nhave it right now. Truango didn't care\nat all, frowning, asking angrily. Cut\nthe crap. Pay or not? Just one sentence.\nTuong Dao's mother couldn't control her\nemotions, pushing Tuong Dao's father\naway, then forcefully retoring, \"Pay\nyour mother's head. Collecting\nprotection fees. You should lay off the\ndrugs.\" Hearing this, Tron-ho\nimmediately ordered, \"Huh, very good.\nAette, make a call to get people over\nhere.\" That minion quickly obeyed,\ntaking out his phone. \"Yes, big\nbrother.\" In a situation, all the\nclassmates were a bit scared, hurriedly\nstanding up, awkwardly preparing to\nleave. Tong Dao, \"Ah, I have some urgent\nbusiness. I'm going back first. My dad\ntold me to come home early.\" Tong Dao\nsmiled bitterly, and replied, \"Then you\nguys go back first. Be careful on the\nway.\" Just at this moment, suddenly, a\nloud shout was heard. A bunch of\ncowards. Chu House stood straight,\nspeaking loudly with righteousness. Da\nDao's family is in trouble, and you guys\nare scared to the point of peeing your\npants and running away one by one.\nWhoever leaves now, don't say you know\nme. Chu Hao in the future. Seeing Chu\nHa's action, Tuang Dao couldn't help but\nexclaim in surprise. Chuha. Chua put his\nhand on Tuong Dao's shoulder, comforting\nher in a low voice, \"Da Dao, I know\nthese people. Let me go over and talk to\nthem. They won't make things difficult\nfor your family.\" Tong Dao smiled and\nsaid, \"Really? Then thank you so much.\"\nChuha replied with a sarcastic tone.\n\"I'm not like some people giving money\nas a gift, but acting all flashy, afraid\nothers wouldn't know.\" Tramac heard this\nand immediately felt extremely annoyed,\nthreatening aggressively. Try saying one\nmore sentence. I'll kill you.\nThis caused Chua to turn pale with\nfright, staring wideeyed in horror. Even\nShuang Ho's group was no exception. Each\nof their faces turning pale, thinking,\n\"This kid's aura is really scary.\" Just\nas they felt, Tran Mack was imposing at\nthis moment, radiating an immensely huge\npower, causing Chu How in the distance\nto tremble in fear. Tranho's minions\nshowed a fierce and evil appearance as\nsoon as they appeared, opening their\nmouths to say, \"Brother Ho, what's the\nmatter that you called us?\" Tron-ho\nreplied coldly, \"There are people not\nfollowing the rules. You tell me what\nshould be done?\" The minion heard this\nand immediately smiled excitedly. Then\nisn't that very simple? Tuang Dao's\nmother asked worriedly, \"What do you\nguys want to do?\" Just as she finished\nspeaking, Chuha immediately spoke up to\nstop them. \"Wait,\"\nspeaking politely, \"Brother Ho, this is\nmy friend's family restaurant. Give me\nsome face.\" Hearing this, Tron-ho\nreached out and patted Chu Hao's face,\nasking, \"Chuh, how does your Chu family\nopen a pig slaughterhouse?\" Chuho was a\nbit confused, feeling puzzled by\nChuanggho's action, smiling appeasingly,\n\"Yes, hope brother Ho go easy on us.\"\nTruang Ho didn't listen to Chuho at all,\ninstead directly slapping Chu Hao hard\non the face, saying arrogantly, \"Give\nyou face? Who the hell are you? Even\nyour father wouldn't dare ask me to give\nhim face.\" Tuong Dao's mother saw this\nand immediately stepped forward to stop\nit, \"What kind of skill is hitting a\nchild? If you're capable, aim at me.\"\nChuho lost control at this moment,\nblurting out, \"Twrongho, are you crazy?\nDidn't we have a deal? As long as I\nshowed up, you would take your people\nand leave.\" Hearing Chu Hao say this?\nThe surrounding classmates immediately\nreacted. A deal? What does Chuha mean by\nthat? Was Chrongho called here by Chuha?\nTurns out they're in cahoots. Chuhow is\nso sinister. Tuong Dao also didn't\nexpect things to be like this. Angrily\nscolding Chuha. You, you are truly\ndespicable. Chuhow broke out in a cold\nsweat, panicking and thinking to\nhimself, \"Damn it. I'm such an idiot.\nWhy did I spill everything?\" Chong-ho\nlooked at Chu Hao, sneered, and said,\n\"That's right. I did agree with you. But\nnow I don't want to leave anymore. What\ndo you do to me?\" Chu Hao was scared\npale, trembling all over as he said, \"I\nwas wrong, brother Ho. I'm leaving right\nnow. No, I'm getting lost right now.\"\nJust like that, Chuhow left helplessly,\nhis heart full of unwillingness and\nresentment. Fine. Consider me stupid\nthis time. But don't you guys expect to\nlive peacefully. I must witness your end\nwith my own eyes. After Chu Hao left,\nTruanho immediately ordered his\nsubordinates. Men, smash it for me. The\nhenchmen quickly responded, \"Yes.\" The\nnext second, the sound of crashing rang\nout incessantly. They used weapons to\nsmash Tuong Dao's family ery. Watching\ntheir actions, everyone could only stand\nand watch helplessly. Tuong Dao stood\nfrozen in place like a statue, thinking\nabsent-mindedly. This restaurant holds\nmy dreams and hopes. I wanted a change.\nI wanted to stand at the same height as\nin Kadu yet. Tuong Dao seemed to be\ndriven to a corner, crying and screaming\nhelplessly. I'll fight you to the death.\nHowever, the next second, Tuong Dao's\nhand was held back by another hand. It\nwas him, Tranmac, smiling gently and\nsaying, Let them smash it. Don't worry,\nhowever much they smash today, I will\nmake them pay you back 10 times over.\nTranmack comforted. Trust me, Tuong Dao\nreplied with tears in her eyes. I trust\nyou, Tranmack. Tranmack gently patted\nTuang Dao's head while thinking in my\npast life when I was in the most pain\nand helpless. She was the one who stayed\nby my side, warming my heart. In this\nlife, let me protect you. As soon as the\nthought ended, Tren Mack rushed forward.\nHe asked coldly, \"Done smashing yet?\"\nTron-ho smoked a cigarette and said\nimpatiently, \"Who are you? Tired of\nliving, daring to meddle in my Tron-ho's\nbusiness?\" Tranmack maintained his icy\nattitude, his eyes stern as he replied,\n\"I am someone you cannot afford to\nprovoke.\" Tron-ho laughed excitedly.\n\"Haha, did you guys hear that?\" He said,\n\"I dare not touch him. Haha, this brat\nis crazy.\" A high school student daring\nto talk like that. Tranmack ignored\nTron-ho's attitude, only coldly\nreminding, \"Compensate 10 times the\ndamage. Apologize to the uncle and aunt\nright here.\" \"Do that and I will spare\nyou.\" True Kuang on the side anxiously\nadvised Tranac. \"Are you crazy? Come\nback quickly,\" Tong Dao's mother said\nworriedly. \"Tran Mack is standing up for\nour family. We can't just watch him die\nwithout saving him. I will agree to\nTruong- Ho's demands.\" Tuang Dao's\nfather immediately agreed. Yeah, I'll go\nborrow money right now. Chuhow stood\nfrom afar watching the show, unable to\nsuppress his excitement and smuggness,\nthinking sinisterly. Even the heavens\nare helping me. Tranmack, you are dead\nfor sure. Tron-ho impatiently reminded,\nbrat, state your backer or if you have\nany scheme, otherwise don't dream of\nwalking out of this restaurant today.\nTranmack coldly replied, \"My backer is\nmyself.\" Hearing that, Tron-ho spitting\nsaliva, roared, \"Since that's the case\ntoday, you must leave behind at least an\narm or a leg.\" Hearing these words,\nTranmax smiled contemptuously, thinking,\n\"Want to my limbs? Haven't heard\nthat kind of talk in years.\" Humph.\nTron-ho aggressively ordered, \"Get him.\"\nTuong Dao's mother immediately stopped\nthem. \"Don't. I'll give you the money.\"\nHowever, Tronho didn't care at all, his\nface darkening as he replied, \"Too\nlate.\" Unlike what Tron-ho thought,\nTranmack easily glided past those\nhenchmen, then beat them black and blue.\nBang! Bang! Sounds rang out. They were\nall beaten to swollen noses and faces,\nlying on the ground, trembling and\ngroaning. \"Ah, uggh, it hurts to death.\"\nTuang Dao and everyone were stunned by\nthe scene before them. Truang looked\nfull of surprise, exclaiming, \"Well\ndone, Tranmack. Didn't expect you to\nfight so well.\" Chuha was no exception.\nPanicked and fearful. Cold sweat\nstreaming down, thinking, \"Damn it, what\nis this situation? Why is Trax so good\nat fighting?\" Tron-ho dusted off his\nclothes, sneered, and asked, \"Brat, your\nkung fu is pretty good, but can you\ndodge bullets?\" Tranmack thought,\n\"Seriously, although I'm currently at\nthe first stage of chi condensation\nrealm, I can't dodge bullets yet.\"\nFacing a gun is still a bit risky. At\nthis moment, Tron-ho rustled around\npulling something out of his pocket.\nTranmack immediately realized the issue,\npunching Truanggho directly in the face.\nA thud sound rang out. Truang Ho was hit\nuntil he coughed up blood, falling\nhelplessly onto his back, letting out a\nmuffled groan. Truang Ho was full of\nrage, gritting his teeth and cursing.\nYou dodged, you dare to hit me? I But\nbefore Trong-ho could finish his\nsentence, Tranmack landed another punch\non him, sending him flying. Trang Ho\ncoughed up blood and pain, his face\ncovered in sweat. Tramax stepped on\nTrong-Ho, coldly threatening. Still dare\nto pull a gun. I'll finish you off right\nnow. Tron-ho explained in fear. Big big\nbrother, I was wrong. I don't have a gun\non me. I just wanted to scare you a bit.\nTranmack's eyes darkened, coldly,\nsaying, compensate 10 times. Tran-ho\nimmediately replied obediently. 10\ntimes. 10 times. Tranmack added another\ncondition. Apologize to the uncle and\naunt right here. Tran-ho hurriedly said,\napologize. I'll cow out and apologize.\nHearing this, Tranmack finally moved his\nfoot away. Then, as he turned to leave,\nhe said indifferently, then go over\nthere and apologize quickly. Truang Ho\nwith a swollen face said, \"Little\nsister, please show mercy. Spare me. I\nagree to compensate for the losses.\"\nTuong Dao replied, \"Seriously, apologize\nto my parents and guarantee that you\nwill never come here to cause trouble\nagain.\" Hearing this, Trong-Ho\nimmediately cowtowed in front of Tuang\nDao&lt;unk&gt;s parents and said, \"It was I,\nTron-ho, who had eyes but failed to see\nMount Thai. I apologize to you, too.\nPlease forgive me. I guarantee that in\nthe future, my people will never come\nhere to cause trouble again. I also\nguarantee that your restaurant will be\nsafe and sound.\" Tong Dao's mother\nfrowned and replied, \"Then let's leave\nit at that. No need for 10 times\ncompensation. Just pay the exact price.\"\nTruang Ho, face covered in sweat, forced\na smile in his fear and asked, \"Little\nsister, can we go now?\" Tuang Dao said,\n\"Go, go.\" Hearing this, the henchmen\nimmediately helped Truang Ho up. Truang\nHo smiled and said, \"Thank you. Thank\nyou.\" As he spoke, they ran away with\nthumping footsteps. \"Let's go. Let's go\nquickly.\" Having solved the problem,\nTranmac also said indifferently to Tuong\nDao, \"Da Dao, I have some business. I'll\nhead back first. If you encounter any\ntrouble in the future, remember to call\nme. Tong Dao smiled softly and replied,\n\"Yeah, I know. The Kim family. A mansion\nwith an antique design, but no less\nluxuriously.\nWelcome.\"\nTranmac replied coldly. \"Elder Kim, no\nneed for formalities. If there is\nsomething, just say it straight.\" Kim\nboy van seeing Tr's attitude felt a bit\nannoyed. Tranmack was too rude. Although\nher grandfather invited him. No guest\nwould just swagger in and sit in the\nhost seat like that. A cup of hot tea\nwas poured. Kim Chong Wan said, \"Master,\nthis is top quality to Hong Pow. Please\nhave taste.\" However, Tramac immediately\nrefused. \"No need a dad Kim, what is it\nexactly?\" Kim Chong Juan laughed\nbitterly in helplessness, replying this.\nSeeing Tranmax's attitude, Kimboy Van\nwas fuming even more, thinking, inviting\nhim to drink good tea, and he doesn't\neven look at it. Too arrogant. Kim Chong\nJuan spoke up. Master Tran is a\nstraightforward person, so this old man\nwon't stand on ceremony either. First, I\nwant to thank you for your talisman,\nwhich cured my wife's persistent illness\nof many years. This old man, Tran Mack,\nimmediately interrupted. It was a fair\ndeal. Both sides were willing. We owe\neach other nothing. Speak of the second\nmatter. Hearing this, Kim Chung Juan\nwent straight to the main topic. I would\nlike to invite Master Tran to take a\nlook and see if my illness can be cured.\nTranmax smiled and asked back. \"This is\nthe real purpose you invited me here,\nisn't it?\" Kim Chong Wan replied.\n\"That's right. I've made you laugh.\"\nTranmax said indifferently. \"Now use all\nyour strength to punch me.\" \"Let me\nsee.\" Hearing this request, Kim Chong\nWan was a bit suspicious and confused,\nbut still obediently followed. \"Huh? All\nright.\" The next second, he gathered his\nwhole body's energy. Then his eyes\nglowed with red light, rushing directly\nforward, shouting loudly. Huh. Seeing\nthis power, Tranmack immediately became\nserious. He recognized it. Kim Chong Wan\nis actually an internal real martial\nartist. Thinking this, he opened his\nmouth and said, \"I know now. Your\nillness can be cured with just one\nessence nurturing spirit pill.\" Kim\nChong Juan laughed happily and said,\n\"This illness has tormented me for\ndecades. Every time it flares up, the\npain makes me not want to live, and\nfamous doctors have been helpless.\nMaster Tran, if you can cure it, I am\nwilling to gift you half of my fortune.\nStanding to the side, Kim, boy, Van\nimmediately dissuaded him. Grandpa,\ndon't be impulsive. Tranmack hasn't\nasked anything, just took one look and\nsaid he could cure it. She thought in\nconfusion. This is too sloppy. Tranmack\nheard this and explained. Actually,\nElder Kim is not sick, but because the\ncultivation method he practices is\nincomplete, leading to meridian\ncongestion accumulating over many years.\nPlus, he suffered internal injuries when\nhe was young, which never healed, so it\nbecame what it is now. Kim Chong Wong\nheard this and immediately agreed.\nRight. Right. Master Tran is absolutely\ncorrect. Tranmack continued. However, to\ncure it completely, you must give up\npracticing martial arts, otherwise it\nwill relapse in the future. Are you\nwilling? Kim Chong Wan was thunderruck,\nasking in shock, give up martial arts?\nHow is that different from taking my\nlife? However, the next second, Kim\nChong Wan had an opposing thought. But I\nalso can't stand the torture of the\nillness anymore. I Tramac thought\nhelplessly, having witnessed the miracle\nof martial arts and the immortal path.\nWho would be willing to return to being\nimmortal? Kim boy van saw her\ngrandfather sighing dejectedly. Unable\nto help worrying, she called,\n\"Grandfather, grandfather.\" Kim Chong\nWan dejectedly said, \"This old man is 72\nthis year. Won't live much longer. The\nfamily fortune has been accumulated\nenough. That incomplete martial arts\ntechnique was something I obtained by\nchance. It built the great Kim family of\ntoday. Perhaps I should be satisfied.\nThe next second, Kim Chong Juan made up\nhis mind. Master Tran, I'm willing to\ngive up martial arts. I only beg the\nmaster to cure my illness. Hearing this,\nTramac immediately stood up and replied,\n\"Good. However, there's no need for the\nfamily assets. I will only take 3\nbillion. Consider it the cost for\nrefining the spirit pill. In a few days,\nsend someone to pick it up. Kim boy Van\nasked in confusion, \"Why wait a few\ndays? Can it be done now?\" Standing\naside, Kim Chong Wan immediately\nexplained, \"Little Van, such a\nmiraculous pill. Surely we must give\nMaster Tran time to prepare.\" Tranmac\ninterjected, \"The essence nurturing pill\nisn't some rare pill. I just have to go\nprepare the medicinal ingredients.\"\nAlthough he said that the real reason\nwas another important issue, he was out\nof money. Kim Chong Wan smiled and\nasked, \"I wonder what ingredients Master\nTran needs. I will immediately send\npeople to find them.\" Tramac replied,\n\"That works, too. I'll write you a\nprescription.\" A moment later, he handed\nKim Chun want a piece of paper. \"It's\nthese things.\" Tranmac thought to\nhimself. I wrote double the quantity.\nThe rest I have my own plans for. Seeing\nthe ingredients on the paper, Kim Chong\nJuan immediately spoke up. These\ningredients are precious, but they\naren't considered too hard to find. Give\nme 2 days. Tranmack reminded. Call me\nwhen you find enough. I will immediately\nrefine the essence nurturing pill.\nSpeaking of this, he changed his tone.\nElder Kim, how much do you know about\nthe martial arts world? Kim Chong Juan\nreplied, I consider myself to know quite\na bit. After all, being able to\ncultivate martial arts was all thanks to\na cultivation manual. This type of\ncultivation cannot compare to those\nancient martial arts sex with legacies\npassed down. Hearing this, Tranmax's\nface darkened, asking with confusion,\n\"Are there still ancient martial arts\nsects in Hasa?\" Kim Chong Juan replied,\n\"Yes, although I don't know where their\nmountain gates are ultimately located,\nthey definitely exist and have\nlong-standing legacies.\" Tramax said,\n\"Then tell me about the martial arts\nworld first.\" He seemed to have some\nexpectation. Perhaps the live family has\nconnections with those ancient martial\narts sections. Kim Chong Nuan began to\nrecount martial arts has four great\nrealms called the four realms of martial\nDao distinguished as external realm.\nInternal realm, transformation realm and\na legendary divine realm. The external,\ninternal and transformation realms are\nfurther divided into three small stages.\nInitial success, great success and peak.\nAfter entering the transformation realm,\none will be honored as a martial arts\ngrandmaster. Martial arts grand masters\nare as rare as phoenix feathers and\nchilean horns. Each one is a powerhouse\nguarding a region establishing a great\nfamily representing the peak existence\nof current martial arts. As for the\ndivine realm, it hasn't appeared in\nnearly a 100red years. Hearing this,\nTranmack immediately asked, \"What realm\nis your strength at?\" Kim Chong Juan\nsmiled and replied, \"I'm a martial\nartist at the great success stage of the\ninternal realm. Fighting alone for so\nmany years, I have never met an\nopponent.\" Tramac pondered internally.\nSo, I'm currently roughly at the peak of\nthe internal realm, just one step away\nfrom the transformation realm. But this\nis just a division of strength levels.\nIt cannot fully speak to combat power.\nTherefore, I am not afraid of a\ntransformation realm Grandmaster. But if\nI meet a legendary divine realm expert,\nI will be in some danger. Must improve\nmy strength quickly. At Vua number one\nhigh school, the morning sun was\ndazzlingly bright. Tramac thought,\n\"Today is the day to receive report\ncards and also the day the Yin family\ncomes to enol the engagement.\" Tramac\nthought while walking with his head held\nhigh, \"If you dare treat me like in my\npast life today, I will make it so you\ncannot return a Hadu.\" In class 12 to 6,\nfrom outside, one could already hear the\nlaughter and talk of classmates. Haha,\nhow did you do? I don't know, sigh.\nLet's go hang out this winter break. Oh,\nit's Trenwinhow's right-hand man, Lamb\nTow. This rich kid saw Tran Mack enter\nand immediately mocked. Yo, Tranac\ndidn't even take the exam, yet you still\nhave the face to come get the report\ncard. Tranmack couldn't be bothered to\npay attention to him. Didn't reply and\nwalked straight to his seat. Seeing this\nattitude, Tuong Dao sitting far away\nfelt even more admiring in her heart.\nSigh. Tran Mack has suddenly become so\ncalm, even more handsome. And Kadette\nalso seemed to look at him unblinkingly.\nTrengwin how stared in Kadette thinking\nonly in Kadette is worthy of my\nattention. Tranmac is nothing but a\npiece of trash. Home room teacher Von Lu\non held a stack of papers. Spoke up. All\nright. All right. Quiet down. I'm\nhanding out report cards. Duong tongue.\nVery good. Made progress. True Kuang,\nyou dropped five ranks. Must work\nharder. Encadet received the report\ncard. Vonglu on handed over. Vongluon\nsmiled and said to Encadet, second in\nclass, ninth in the whole school, one\nrank higher than last year. Performed\nvery well. Next is Trinhao. Trinhao,\nfirst in class, third in the whole\nschool. Hope that before graduation you\ncan get both first places. Hearing this,\nall students in the class exclaimed in\nsurprise, \"Wow, so impressive.\" Vongluon\npicked up a report card, her face\ngloomy, full of annoyance, shaking with\nanger as she said. Tranmack, last place,\nlast in class, last in school. You are\nthe first student to hand in a blank\npaper since the establishment of this\nVoodoo Chow High School. Hearing this,\nthe atmosphere in the class froze in an\ninstant. The next second, a burst of\nmocking laughter exploded. Two countdown\nfirst places. However, right after that,\nthey immediately remembered Tramac's\nperformance at Tuang Dao's family\nrestaurant yesterday. For such a strong\nperson, what do grades matter? At this\nmoment, class monitor Tren 2, Lu\nsuddenly stood up, pointing at Tranmax's\nface and said, \"Tran Mac is truly the\ndisgrace of our class. He will drag down\nthe class average.\" Tranmac replied\nimpatiently, \"You are too noisy. Can you\nshut up?\" This made Trinu Lu extremely\nsurprised. What did you say? Say that\nagain. Tranmack emphasized each word.\nYou were too noisy. Trentu immediately\ncried and said to Vongluon, \"Teacher,\nTranmack is bullying me.\" Vongluon\ncrossed her arms. Seriously said,\nTranmac apologized to the class monitor\nimmediately. Tranmac just calmly\nreplied, \"Miss Vong, I don't feel I did\nanything wrong. Skipping the exam is\nindeed my fault, but I had difficulties\nI couldn't speak of. If given another\nchance, I don't think I would score\nlower than the class monitor.\" Hearing\nthis sentence, lamb, tao laughed out\nloud, huh? He says his grades are better\nthan the class monitors. Did I hear that\nwrong? Vongluan seriously said to\nTramac, \"Of course, we can't let\neveryone retake the midterm just because\nof you. But I have a mock exam paper\nfrom Hong Kuan High School here. Now you\nand Trinulu do it right in front of the\nclass. Whoever loses must take the\ninitiative to apologize to the other\nending the argument.\" Okay. Hearing\nthis, everyone was extremely surprised,\ndiscussing animatedly. Hong Kuang High\nSchool, Hong Kuang High School's mock\nexam is 10 times harder than the\nuniversity entrance exam. How could\nTramac possibly do it? Trent 2 loose\nsneered and asked Tramac, \"Do you dare\ntake the test? If not, apologize to me\nimmediately. Don't let people laugh at\nme.\" Tranmack replied indifferently. \"In\nthis world, there is nothing that I,\nTanmack, do not dare to do.\" Hearing\nthis, Vongluan opened her mouth and\nsaid, \"Good.\" Other students stepped\nback. Keep quiet to get results quickly.\nThe time limit is 1 hour. Finally, see\nwho has the higher score. Start now. As\ntime started, both began to do the test.\nPin nibs making scratching sounds.\nLooking at Trenu, Lee's expression,\neveryone immediately understood. Even\nTrinulu had to bite her pen. It seems\nthis test is truly difficult. Looking at\nTramac again, it made everyone a bit\nconfused and puzzled. But look at\nTranmack. Why is he so relaxed as if the\nquestions are very simple? His grades\nare far worse than the class monitors.\nLambta thought uncomfortably just\nputting on an act. That trash is\ndefinitely writing nonsense. Tuong Dao\ndidn't think so. Still cheering for\nTramac. Tramac wouldn't write nonsense.\nHis brain is very good. And Kadette also\nseemed full of expectation for this\ncompetition. Trenwinhow smiled and\nthought this competition Tram Mac has\nsurely lost. Half an hour later, the pen\nwas put down on the table. Tramax stood\nup and asked Vonglan, \"Miss Vong, how\nmany days off do we get for winter break\nthis year?\" Vongluon replied, \"Starting\nfrom tomorrow until the 16th of next\nmonth.\" Hearing this, Tranmack\nimmediately turned to leave. \"I got it.\"\nTrent Tulu jumped up in annoyance and\nshouted, \"Stand still. You scribbled a\nbunch of nonsense and now on a run.\nApologized to me quickly.\" Tramac calmly\nreplied, \"I finished. You guys can\ncheck.\" Vongluon asked in shock.\nfinished. The next second she picked up\nthe test paper. Vonglu on exclaimed in\nastonishment. Correct. Correct. Correct.\nCorrect. Correct. 100 questions all\nanswered correctly. Not a single one\nwrong. How is this possible hearing\nthis? Lamb Tao's face turned pale. His\nwhole body trembling, unable to believe\nit. What? How? How is it possible? Tuong\nDao was overjoyed because of this. I\nsaid so. Tranmac is the best. Trentu\nalso seemed not to believe it. snatching\nTranmax's test paper. No. Trinu Lee's\nface instantly turned pale. Then she\nslumped onto the chair, thinking, \"If\nTran Mack is trash, then am I not even\nequal to trash?\" Tran Mack just smiled.\nThen while leisurely leaving, said, \"My\nability? How could it be something you\nmortals can understand?\" Just as Tramax\nstepped out of the school gate, a\nresounding sound rang out. Tranmack, we\nwant to enull the engagement. A group of\nladies wearing goddy dresses waved their\nhands and shouted, \"Tran Mack, we want\nto enull the engagement. Tranmack, we\nwant to enull the engagement.\" Seeing\ntheir appearance, Tran Mack could only\nthink helplessly. If possible, I would\nrather face more than 20 Transformation\nrealm Grand Masters than face this crowd\nof gossipy ladies. Just then, suddenly,\na voice rang out. Stop. Tranmack was\nalso a bit curious about that person.\nAsked, \"Who are you?\" Yenfi pointed at\nTranmax's face, speaking loudly. My\nfather's grandfather is the cousin of\nthe grandson of the grandfather of the\nfather of my cousin Quinton. I represent\nthe Yen family together with my cousin\nQuinton to officially cancel the\nmarriage contract with you. In this\nsituation, Tran Max stood petrified,\nfull of confusion and bewilderment,\nthinking, \"Huh, it wasn't like this in\nthe previous life. Could be because I\nwas reborn, history has changed.\" And he\nopened his mouth to ask, \"Who are you?\nAre you sure you can represent the Yin\nfamily? Yinfi smiled and replied, \"I am\nYinfi. You can call me young Masterfi.\"\nAfter introducing himself, Yinfi\nimmediately turned to leave. \"All right,\nI have delivered the message. This young\nmaster still has business. You don't\nneed to keep me. Goodbye. Let's go.\nLet's go.\" While speaking, Yinfi just\nthrew a stack of cash to that group of\nwomen. Holding the money in their hands,\nthey happily said, \"Young man, if there\nare such good things in the future,\nremember to find me.\" Watching Yinfi's\nactions, Tran Mack could only sigh\nhelplessly, thinking to think the Yin\nfamily has such a dandy. So this is how\nthe Yin family planned to calculate\nthings. At this moment, and Kadette\nsuddenly ran over from behind, saying,\n\"Wait a minute.\" Tramac asked\nsuspiciously, \"Tudendon, is there\nsomething wrong?\" Seeing Tramax's\nattitude, and Kadette felt uneasy and\nconfused inside. Tramax's attitude\ntowards me wasn't like this before. Why\nis he suddenly so cold? So she\nimmediately walked closer to Tramac and\nsaid, \"My mom asked me to ask you. Where\nhave you been these past few days? Why\nhaven't you come back to my house?\" She\nis very worried about you. Tranmack\ncoldly turned to leave. Replying, I've\nrented a room outside. I won't bother\nyour family anymore. Goodbye. This made\nCad yet a bit annoyed saying, \"What do\nyou mean?\" The more she looked at\nTranmack's cold appearance, the more and\nCadet couldn't understand. Tranmack, why\nhave you changed so much? Trinuin House\nstood in the distance, staring at the\ntwo of them talking, his heart full of\nhateful calculations. Tranmack, you have\nthreatened me, so don't blame me for\nbeing unpolite. Uncle Fuang opened his\nmouth to ask suspiciously. Young Master\nFi, I really don't understand. What\nexactly is your intention in doing this?\nYenfi drank hot tea while calmly\nreplying. I don't know what the Yin\nfamily sees in Tramac. They\nfundamentally don't want to break the\nengagement. making such a big fuss about\nbreaking the engagement this time is for\nthe live family to see. Moreover, Tran\nMack will understand the Yen family's\nmeaning. On the other side, Tranmack\nthought while walking, \"The Yin family\njust sees my identity as an internal\nrealm martial artist, but doesn't want\nto confront the Lie family.\" He was full\nof curiosity. The Lie family aren't\nfools. What will they do? At the Lie\nfamily home, Liap Van opened his mouth\nand said, \"Dad, this is the Yin family's\nmove.\" Lie Dong Duong replied gloomily\nonly silently calculating. If I had\nconsidered some family affection back\nthen my live family would have had an\noutstanding talent like Lie Trey. The\nLie family could have become the leader\nof the six great super families. But now\neverything is too late. Tranmack has\nbecome a huge potential rival and the\nYin family's attitude proves this point.\nThe next second, Lie Dong Duong said,\n\"Put the Yin family's matter aside for\nnow. No matter what, on the surface, the\nYin family still stands on our side,\nsaying that Lie Dong Duong tapped the\nground with his cane, reminding but\nabsolutely cannot give Tranm time to\ndevelop. The Lie family's dignity does\nnot allow anyone to affect it. Lie Dong\nDuong seriously ordered act against my\nHoa group and the Tran family in Good\nDuong first while the Tran family's\nwings are not yet full. Destroy all its\nsupport. lie lap. Van hurdly and\nobediently replied, \"Yes, I will go do\nit right away.\" At Trram's place, he was\nconcentrating on cultivation, his body\nradiating a scorching aura. Just then,\nthe phone suddenly rang. Tramac picked\nup and asked, \"Hello, Mom. Is something\nwrong?\" On the other end, lie to Fuang\nreplied, \"You brat, am I sad you rented\na room outside? When did you rent it?\nWhere did you get the money? What do you\nwant to do?\" Tramac replied, \"Mom, my\nbusiness.\" Mom, is there anything about\nyour son that you don't know? What is\nthere to worry about? Light of Wong said\nsternly. Move back immediately for me. I\ndon't feel at ease with you living alone\noutside. Hearing this, Tranmax smiled\nbitterly, trying to find an excuse. Oh,\nmom, I'm learning martial arts from\nmysterious old man. It's really\ninconvenient at the inf family's house.\nIn his heart, he thought, \"Sorry, Mom.\nThere is no mysterious old man.\"\nHowever, Lida Fuang didn't know these\nthings. Just thought Trac was telling\nthe truth. So she replied, \"Then all\nright, but you must ensure your own\nsafety.\" Tranmurly replied, \"Mom, rest\nassured, I guarantee it.\" Lie to Fuang\ncouldn't help but instruct again. Also,\nyou have to go tell the family. Aunt Mai\nthinks she didn't treat you well\nsomewhere and is worrying over there.\nHearing these words, Tranmack pondered,\n\"Indeed, Aunt Mai's face is disgusting,\nbut Uncle has always taken care of me. I\nshould repay him a bit.\" Then he\nreplied, \"Yes, Mom. Rest assured I know\nwhat to do.\" Ho Yinqi Villa area,\nwestern suburbs of Vucha City. The in\nfamily home was brightly lit. And\nKadette asked as soon as she saw\nTranmac, \"You're here.\" Tranmac replied\nindifferently. \"Hello, you call me to\ncome eat.\" And Kadette smiled and said,\n\"Come in.\" Am I smiled as soon as she\nsaw Tranmac is here? Kadette, talk at\nMac. We're about to eat. This attitude\nof Aunt Mai surprised and Kad a little\nlooking at Tran Mack sitting coldly on\nthe sofa. She couldn't help thinking.\nAlthough he seems to have changed a lot,\nhe still lacks education. Far inferior\nto Trinhow. Unclean immediately greeted\nTranmac when he saw him. Tack is here.\nTranmax stood up smiling and replying,\n\"Hello, uncle.\" And this made Inkadi yet\na bit puzzled, wondering inside. Why\ndoes it feel like Transmac's attitude\ntowards dad is so different from his\nattitude towards me and mom? Unclean\nsmiled and asked, \"How is your dad these\ndays?\" Tramac replied, \"Thank you,\nuncle, and for caring. My dad also\nreally wants to come find uncle to catch\nup on old times, but work is too busy.\nHe can't spare the time. Unclean said,\n\"Your dad is truly too competitive. If\nhe was willing to accept the family's\nhelp, he would have long become a\ncapable official in the prefecture.\"\nTranmax smiled and replied, \"Yes.\" A\nmoment later, the table was full of\nsumptuous dishes. Am I asked to Mac, why\ndid you rent a house outside by\nyourself? Hearing this, uncle was a bit\nsurprised. Tumac moved out. Aunt Mai\nfrowned and said to her husband, \"You\nare busy outside from morning to night\nall day. You don't care about family\nmatters at all.\"\nAh. Tranmax spoke coldly. Auntie, I have\nalready decided on this matter. Let's\nnot mention it again. Hearing these\nwords, Aunt felt a bit awkward. Seeing\nTranmax's attitude was a bit off and\nKadette immediately reminded, \"Tran Mac,\nwatch your attitude.\" Seeing her\ndaughter's attitude, Aunt Mai secretly\nworried. this won't do. Must think of a\nway to improve the relationship between\nQ Mack and Kadette. At this moment, the\ndoorbell suddenly rang ding-dong and\nKadette stood up and said, \"It must be\nYi coming to call me. We agreed to go to\na classmate's birthday party together.\"\nAs soon as she opened the door, she\nsmiled and called TNT Yini Duong TNT and\nMo Dong Yini, each beautiful in their\nown way, replied, \"Hello, hi.\" And\nKadette wondered, \"Didn't we agree to\nmeet at the coffee shop? Why did you\nsuddenly come looking for me? Do the\nothers know? The two said, \"They're all\nwaiting in the car. The plan changed.\nWe're going camping first, then going to\nKTV to sing.\" Hearing this, and Kadette\nimmediately turned back into the house,\n\"Is that so? Then wait for me a moment.\nI'll go get a jacket.\" Duong TNTN smiled\nand urged, \"Okay, hurry up.\" And Kadette\nhurly put on her jacket while saying\nurgently, \"Mom, I'm going out with\nfriends. I won't eat dinner at home\ntonight.\" Hearing this, Am I immediately\nsaid, \"Wait, let you go with you. You're\na girl. I don't feel at ease.\" Uncle\nalso chimed in. Tumac, take Kodi yet.\nAunt Mai smiled awkwardly and said,\n\"That's right.\" Tumac considered helping\nAnnie go play with Kadette for a while.\nHearing these words, Tramac also\ncouldn't conveniently refuse, saying,\n\"All right, I'll go with her.\" And\nKadette frowned and said, \"Then let's\ngo.\" Just like that, Tranmack followed\nbehind to protect and Kadet. Duong TNTN\nlooked at Tranmack and asked in\nconfusion, \"Who is he?\" And Kadette\nreplied, \"The son of my dad's friend.\nCame here to study.\" Tramac thought to\nhimself. Duong TNTN is a rich young\nlady. Always looks down on others. Is\nthe girlfriend of the school basketball\nteam, Captain Tron Hien, and frequently\nmade things difficult for me in my past\nlife. Mo Dong Yani looks cold on the\noutside, but has a kind heart. After\ngraduation, I didn't hear any news about\nher anymore. Since in Kadi yet pushed me\naside, I can also be at leisure.\nArriving at the place, Trang Hien's\ngroup noticed Tramac's presence, then\nsneered and mocked. Oh, who is this?\nIsn't this the famous exam skipper?\nTrash Tramac. Tranmack frowned and\nthought, \"This is a matter of our class\n6. How could class 2 know so quickly?\nUnless someone intentionally wanted to\nhumiliate me.\" Truang Hi continued. You\nalso want to pursue the school beauty?\nWhy don't you take a piss and look at\nyour reflection to see if you are\nworthy? Duong TNTN also immediately took\nin Kadiat's arm, provoking, \"That's\nright, Kad is Tingwinhow's crush. He is\nthe son of the vice prefect. What do you\ncount as you dare to cling to Kad?\"\nTranmax stood in front of them unhappily\nretorting in a cold voice. \"In my eyes,\nwhat do you people count as?\" Trax's\neyes were sharp as knives, asking,\n\"Daring to talk to me like that, do you\nfeel worthy?\" Duong TNT hugged her\nboyfriend's arm and acted spoiled.\nTruang Hien, he's bullying me. Truang\nHien shouted, \"Brat apologized to TN\nimmediately and I will consider letting\nyou off.\" Tramac did not show weakness.\nRetoring, \"Brat, you immediately cowtow\nand apologize to me and I will also\nconsider letting you off.\" Tron Hian\nimmediately threatened, \"Damn, you are\nvery arrogant, you little brat. Then\ntoday, I will teach you how to be a\nhuman.\" and Kadette spoke up to\nintervene at this moment. All right,\nstop arguing. Today is TNT's birthday.\nShe advised Tranmack again. Can't you\nyield to Truang Hi a little with his\nsmall physique of yours? One punch from\nTruang Hi and you'll be on the floor. Yi\nstood by watching doing nothing. At this\nmoment, Tran Mack accidentally glanced\nat her. Yiani was immediately startled\nin her heart. Why is the look he gave me\nso strange? As if he has known me for\nmany years. Trong Hi said with murderous\nintent, \"Forget it. Out of respect for\nthe school beauty, I'll let you off this\none time.\" He walked towards the car,\narrogantly ordering. However, my car is\na bit small. It can't contain a great\ngod like you. You go in another car.\nTranmack had to hitch a ride in another\ncar. But wherever he went, every car\nfound an excuse. This car is full. My\ncar is also full. No way. No way. You\naren't planning to walk, are you? At\nthis moment, Yi open her mouth.\nTransmac, the three of us can squeeze a\nbit. It's just a little tight. And\nKadette immediately objected. Yianni,\nwhy let him squeeze with us? TN asked\ncuriously. Little Yani, don't tell me\nyou've fallen for him. Yi blushed and\nhurriedly explained, \"What are you\nsaying? We're all classmates. I just\ndidn't want him to lose face too much.\"\nTinten resignedly said, \"All right, all\nright, forget it. I know you're\nkind-hearted. I'll go tell Thatch Duong\nin the back.\" And asked him to move over\nthere. At this moment, three cars were\nspeeding down the road. Thatch Duong was\ndriving, excitedly, stepping on a gas\npedal, shouting loudly, \"Watch me\novertake them one by one.\" The\npink-haired girl beside him also\nscreamed in excitement. Thatch Duong is\nthe best. So thrilling. But his car\nstill couldn't overtake the leading car.\nThatch Duong angrily slammed the\nsteering wheel. \"This piece of junk,\nit's really in the way. Didn't you fill\nit with gas? You cowardly turtle. If you\ncan't drive, then don't drive.\" The\npink-haired girl beside him also said\nangrily, \"Hump, a broken 86, yet it\ndares to block Brother Duong's way.\"\nSuddenly, Thatch Duong's car breakd\nurgently. His eyes widened, his mouth\ndropped open, scared to death. The two\ncars had collided. Thatch Duong panicked\nand got out of the car. \"Oh, my precious\ncar.\" He immediately turned a curse at\nthe car in front. Do you know how to\ndrive? This is called illegal stopping.\nDo you understand? Look, you made me\ncrash into your car. A man with a buzz\ncut reported into the car. Master so a\nbrat rear ended us and he's cursing me\nfor illegal stopping. Thatch Duong\nroared furiously. Who are you calling a\nbrat? A mysterious person in the car\nspoke up. Dou forget it. Fourth Master\nKim has urgent business with me. Don't\nwaste any more time. Dau immediately\nreplied, \"Yes, master.\" So then he\nturned his head to glare at Thatch Duong\nonce preparing to leave. But thatch\nDuong was still shouting loudly, \"Stop\nright there. You want to run without\ncompensating me for the car? No way. At\nthis moment, Trong Hi also got out of\nthe car and asked Thatch Duong, \"What's\ngoing on?\" Thatch Duong immediately\ntaffled, \"This guy breaks suddenly\ncausing me to rear end him and now he\nwants to run.\" Trang Hi said coldly,\n\"Then we can't let him run. Go up ahead\nand block them.\" In an instant, a group\nof young men surrounded Dao, too,\nspreading their arms to block him from\nleaving. So Van Hung sat in the car\nsmoking a cigar, sighing helplessly. I\nnever thought there would be a day when\nI, so Van Hung, would be bullied by a\nbunch of brats. Van Hung called out from\ninside the car. Dao Tu, get out of the\ncar. Dao immediately stepped forward to\nopen the door. As soon as he saw Van\nHung, get out of the car. Truang Hi was\ninstantly stunned. You are. At this\nmoment, he couldn't help but exclaim in\nhorror. So Kuang Nan, so Van Hung. He\nglanced at Truong Hien and said coldly,\n\"Has a brat like you heard of my\nnickname, too? Whose kid are you?\" Trang\nHi immediately replied respectfully, \"My\nfather is Truang Qui.\" Hearing it was an\nacquaintance, Van Hung said, \"So it's\nTrong Qui's son. For your father's sake,\nyou can go.\" Trang Hi immediately bowed\nrespectfully. \"Thank you for your great\nkindness, Brother Hong.\" Then he turned\nto say to Thatch Duong, \"Hurry up and\nthank Brother Hong for not haggling with\njuniors like us.\" But Van Hung spoke up.\nI told you to go. I didn't say he could\ngo. Truang Hi pleaded for his friend.\nBrother Hung, you're a famous figure in\nVu Chowo City. Please don't hold a\ngrudge against us. But Van Hung only\ncoldly ordered his subordinate. It's too\nlate. Da call and get people over here.\nTruang Hi clasped his hands and\nimplored, \"Brother Hung, please consider\nmy father's face and let him go.\" Van\nHung scolded brat, \"Go back and ask your\nfather if he dares to tell me to give\nhim face.\" Trang Hi's face instantly\nturned pale. So Van Hong was the emperor\nof the underground world in the entire\nVua area. It was said that there was an\neven greater power backing him. Before\nhim his own family was nothing. What\nshould he do about this? Suddenly Van\nHung proposed a condition. If you want\nto go that's fine. Leave those two\nlittle girls to drink with me and\nrelieve my boredom. His gaze was fixed\ntightly on Yin Ni and in Kadiette. The\nothers immediately shouted anxiously.\nMaster. So thatch Duong immediately fell\nto his knees, begging for mercy. Brother\nHung, I was wrong. I am willing to\ncompensate you for the loss. Please beg\nyou to spare me. Van Hung said.\nCompensation? All right, I'll charge you\n3 billion a minute. Calculate yourself\nhow much you should pay. Thatch Duong\nwas at a dead end and had to hug Trong\nHi's arm for help. Brother Hen, save me.\nVan Hung ordered his subordinates. Throw\nthis brat and those two girls into the\ncar. Beat up the rest of them for me.\nteach them a lesson. The girl screamed\nin fear. Huh? Don't come over here.\nSuddenly, a gust of wind swept past Van\nHung's subordinates, leaving them all\nstunned. Tranmack appeared like a\ndescending angel standing in front of\nthe two girls, saying calmly, \"I'm\nprotecting these two.\" Van Hung opened\nhis mouth to ask, \"Who the hell are\nyou?\" Tranmack replied indifferently, \"I\nam someone you cannot afford to offend.\"\nHearing these words, he laughed loudly\nand Kadette felt very annoyed. Why does\nthis guy like to show off so much? What\nuses it for him to step up? Yi was\nworried for him. Tranmack, how do you\nplan to get out of this? Van Hung\npointed at Tranmack and questioned, \"I\ncan see it. You can't fool me. Who\nexactly are you?\" Tranmack teased\nindifferently. \"Didn't I already say it?\nI am someone you cannot afford to\noffend. Are you hard of hearing?\"\nHearing this rude remark, Truong Hien\nand Thatch Duong's faces instantly turn\nwhite. Is this guy tired of living?\nDaring to speak to so Van Hung like\nthat. So Van Hung might just kill him\ndirectly. Van Hung simply ordered his\nsubordinates, \"Deal with him for me.\"\nVan Hung's subordinates immediately\nrushed up one by one. They swung their\nfists at Tranmack, but every punch was\nblocked by his hand as fast as\nlightning. Seeing this scene, Van Hung's\nexpression changed in shock. \"Is he\nactually for real? All of you get him!\"\nAll his subordinates immediately swarmed\nup, surrounding Tranac, shouting loudly,\n\"Go to hell!\" Tranmack remained\nexpressionless, his body dodging as if\nteleporting. In the blink of an eye,\ncountless fists from the subordinates\nrained down. Not long after, Van Hung's\nsubordinates were seen lying scattered\non the ground, groaning incessantly.\n\"Oh, my ribs, my hand, my life.\" At this\nmoment, so Van Hung was so terrified\nthat cold sweat streamed down. His\nsubordinates were no ordinary people.\nYet in less than a minute, they had all\ncollapsed. Watching Tranmack calmly\ndusting himself off. He felt a wave of\npanic. Meanwhile, Tran's expression\ndidn't change. He wasn't even out of\nbreath, as if he wasn't the one who had\njust fought. Even Truang Hien was\nstunned into a days. Is Tran Mack that\npowerful? Taking down over a dozen\npeople by himself. At this moment, Dao\nTu volunteered. Master, so let me teach\nhim a lesson. Van Hung instructed, \"Just\ndon't kill him.\" Dou stood in front of\nTramac and threatened, \"Kid, I will make\nyou regret meeting me.\" Tramac only\nreplied blandly. \"Finished with your\nlast words?\" Dau was furious upon\nhearing this, roaring, \"You want to\ndie?\" He immediately emitted a\nterrifying killing intent. Like a wild\nbeast, Van Hung smirked. Dau's strength\nhad improved quite a bit. Dao 2\nimmediately threw a powerful punch,\nrushing straight towards Tranmac, but\nTranac maintained that handsome\nindifference. Truang Hi gritted his\nteeth in anger only to see in the next\nsecond Dao 2 was flung away crashing\nheavily onto the ground. Van Hung was so\nshocked that the cigar in his mouth fell\nout. Dao was a special forces soldier he\nhad hired for a high price. How could he\nbe beaten away so miserably now everyone\naround gasped in admiration. Why is he\nso good? His fighting is topnotch.\nTruang Hi was trembling with fear. Just\nnow he was planning to teach Tranac a\nlesson. He really must have been tired\nof living. As for Kadette, she's\nsecretly evaluated. So, this is his real\nTrump card. Such martial prowess is\nindeed something to be proud of. But in\nthis era, money and resources are what\nmatter most. Compared to Vinha, you're\nstill far behind. Yini, however, made no\nsecret of her delight. A man like this\nis the husband I want to marry. Van Hung\nhurriedly asked his subordinate, \"How is\nDao too?\" He trembled while holding his\narm and said, \"Master, so my arm is\nbroken.\" He He is very likely a\nlegendary martial arts cultivator. So\nVan Hung's face immediately changed.\nMartial artist. Suddenly, he made a\ncooperation offer. Kid, you're pretty\ngood. How about becoming my bodyguard?\nThe monthly salary is 350 million.\nConsider what happened today as never\nhaving happened. What do you think?\nEveryone was instantly stunned. The\nmonthly salary of 350 million was\nsecondary. The title of being so Van\nHung's man was worth much more. But Tran\nMack disdainfully refused. \"You want me\nto be your bodyguard? Are you insulting\nme?\" Van Hung angrily pulled out a gun.\n\"Brat, I gave you face. Don't push your\nluck. Can you fight against a gun?\"\nEveryone around immediately screamed in\nterror. \"Ah, he has a gun. It's over.\nWe're done for this time.\" Facing the\nmuzzle of the gun, Tranmack remained\nindifferent, as if it were nothing. Then\nhe spoke in an icy voice. I'll give you\na chance. Put the gun down, cow out, and\nbeg me for mercy, and I will spare your\ndog life.\nBrat, I'm very curious. Where do you get\nsuch confidence? Katly advised, \"Tran\nMack, can't you yield a little? Keeping\nyour life is more important.\" In his\nmind, Tran Mack was calculating.\nAlthough I can't stop bullets yet, I\nhave plenty of ways to kill him before\nhe can fire. Suddenly, his phone rang.\nThe 18th of the first lunar month is an\nauspicious day. The 18th of the first\nlunar month is an auspicious day. Tramac\nthen said, \"Wait a moment. I need to\ntake this call.\" Van Hung immediately\npermitted. \"Fine, go ahead and leave\nyour last words.\" As soon as he picked\nup, the voice on the other end said,\n\"Mr. TR, the medicinal ingredients you\nneeded last time are ready.\" On the\nother end, Boy Van asked Tranmack, \"When\ncan you come over to treat my\ngrandfather's illness?\" He replied, \"I'm\nfree now, but I can't leave for another\nhour and a half.\" Hearing this, Boy Van\nbecame worried. Mr. TR, are you in\ntrouble? Perhaps I can help you resolve\nit. Tranmax said without hiding\nanything. There is someone named so van\nhung pointing a gun at me. I have to\ndeal with him before I can come to your\nplace. He suddenly let out an awe, then\nhanded the phone to Van Hung here. He\nimmediately took it. I want to hear who\nyou've invited. As soon as he picked up\nthe phone, Boy Van shouted loudly\nthrough the phone. So, Van Hung, do you\nwant a rebel? You even dare to offend my\ngrandfather's honored guest? Van Hung\npanicked and hurly denied. Second miss,\nsecond miss, what you saying? I wouldn't\ndare offend the old master's honored\nguest, she explained angrily. The\nstudent standing in front of you is my\ngrandfather's honored guest, Mr. Tran.\nEven I dare not speak loudly in front of\nhim. Van Hung stammered, trembling.\nWhat? Elder Kim's honored guest. At this\nmoment, Tramac finally spoke. Can you\nreturn the phone to me now? Van Hung,\nterrified, repeatedly said, \"Yes, yes,\nyes, yes, yes.\" He immediately changed\nhis attitude. It turns out to be Mr.\nTran. I had eyes but failed to see Mount\nThai. Please be generous and spare me.\nThe voice from the phone echoed. Mr.\nTran, I have scolded. So Van Hung,\nplease spare his life. Send me your\nlocation. I will immediately send\nsomeone to pick you up. Tramac said to\nVan Hung, \"All right, this matter ends\nhere. Stop making that face. You look\nlike you're constipated.\" Yes. Yes.\nThank you, Mr. Tran. Just because of\nphone call. So Van Hung actually\napologized to a high school student. Is\nthis is this still so van hung? What\nexactly happened? Who am I? Where am I?\nWhy can't I react in time? I still have\nbusiness. You guys go first. But go\nquickly. Goodbye, Mr. Tran. Goodbye, Mr.\nTran. The quality of medicinal herbs\nisn't bad, Mr. Tran. Do you need any\nother tools? For example, an alchemy\nfurnace. Who told you that refining\npills requires a furnace? Doesn't it say\nso in novels? The better the furnace,\nthe higher the efficacy of the pills.\nIsn't that right? Haha. for me to refine\npills. These hands are enough. A true\nimmortal cultivator doesn't need a\nfurnace at all. Tranmack clasped his\nhands. Chanting a spell, spirit\ngathering array. He immediately released\nhis spirit body, shouting, \"Go!\" The\nvarious spiritual herbs immediately\nswirled together, gradually blending\ninto small pills. Tranmack continued to\ncast a charm. Origin nurturing pill. He\nimmediately cast a spell on the pill\nform. Having done all this, Tranmack\nexhaled wearily, thinking, \"If not for\nmy rich experience in alchemy and the\nfact that the origin nurturing pill is\nthe most basic type with my current chi\ncondensation level one realm, I'm afraid\nI wouldn't have been able to refine it\nsuccessfully.\" Chun Wan asked with both\nanxiety and curiosity, \"Grandmaster\nTran, how is it?\" Tranm handed him a\npill and said, \"Take it. Swallow it\ndirectly.\" He received it, trembling\nwith joy. After Chong Wan took it, Boy\nVan asked worriedly, \"Grandpa, how is\nthe effect?\" Chung Juan was sitting\ncross-legged, concentrating on restoring\nhis power. Boyan asked Tran Max\nsuspiciously, \"Is this pill actually\neffective?\" He calmly replied, \"Don't\ndisturb him. Just wait.\" Suddenly, Chung\nWan opened his eyes wide, his whole body\nfull of vigor. Not only did it cure the\nstrange illness in my body, but my\nmartial arts cultivation also increased\nby a level, reaching the peak of\ninternal realm. Chung Wan hurriedly\nclased his hands and bowed to thank\nTranmack. Grandmaster Transgrace of\nRebirth. Please accept a bow from me.\nBut he replied bluntly, \"I gave you the\npill. You pay me remuneration. This is a\ntransaction. No need for thanks.\"\nTranmack handed Chung Nana a stack of\ndocuments and said, \"For the sake of Kim\nBoy van trusting my charms before, I\nhelped you complete the missing parts of\nyour cultivation method. You can\ncontinue to cultivate martial arts in\nthe future.\" Chung Juan opened it to\nlook movingly said this. This, \"Oh my\ngod, too powerful.\" He was so excited\nthat he knelled on the ground and cow\nout, shouting, \"Grandmaster Transk\nkindness, this old man doesn't know how\nto repay. Please accept a bow for me.\"\nBoy Van cried out in panic. Grandpa Chun\nWan immediately reminded his\ngranddaughter. Little Van quickly kneel\nand thank Grandmaster Tran. She\nimmediately obeyed. Kim family's Kim boy\nvan kneels to thank Grandmaster Tran.\nChung Wan was moved to tears. This\ncomplete cultivation method can be\npassed down to the descendants of the\nKim family becoming an eternal legacy of\nthe Kim family. Tranmac thought with the\ncultivation method in this book within 3\nyears Kim Chong Wan will definitely\nbecome a transformation realm\ngrandmaster let alone kneeling even if\nthe Kim family builds a temple to\nworship me it wouldn't be excessive he\nimmediately turned to leave not\nforgetting to instruct all right just\ntransfer the money to my account I have\nthings to do I'm leaving first Chun Wan\nand Boy Van bowed respectfully farewell\nGrandmaster Tran the two watched his\nback until he completely left at This\nmoment, Boy Van opened her mouth to ask,\n\"Grandpa, he just looked at you once and\ncould fill in the missing cultivation\nmethod. Isn't this too mysterious?\"\nChung Juan replied, \"Little Van, you're\nnot in the martial arts world, so you\ndon't know how terrifying that\nGrandmaster Tran is.\" Then he instructed\nher, \"Little Van, go tell everyone, our\nKim family people must never offend\nGrandmaster Tran. If anyone deliberately\ndisobys, kick them out of the Kim family\ndirectly.\" Chong Wan said in a serious\ntone, especially your father who\nspecializes in doing bad things, tell\nhim to manage his subordinates well. If\nsomething like today happens again,\ndon't blame me for not giving him face.\nFinally, he reminded also for the money\ntransferred to Grandmaster Tran,\nremember to add a zero. Boyin hurdly\nreplied, \"Yes, Grandpa. I'll do it right\naway.\" By this time, it was already\ndark. Tranmack walked alone on the\nstreet talking on the phone with\nsomeone. \"Yeah, mom, rest assured. I'm\nEuphina. Hanging up the phone, he\nthought, I didn't expect Moa need to\ncall and care about me. Tramac opened\nthe door and enter the house. I still\nneed to seize the time to cultivate. He\nsat down, sighing wearily. At the latest\nin 5 days, I can enter the chi\ncondensation stage. At this moment, the\nphone suddenly vibrated, making Tran Mac\nfeel suspicious. Huh? Who calls us late?\nHe hurriedly picked up and said, \"Who is\nit?\" A voice came from the other end.\nYin Quinton. Hearing this name, Tran\nMack was startled. Ian Quing Tang, she\nsaid, I have arrived in Saitang. Come\npick me up. His head was now full of\nquestion marks. Why does Yin Quinton\nhave my phone number? She arrived in\nSaitang and told me to pick her up. What\nexactly does the Yin family want to do?\nAt this moment, Quinton was at the\nairport with Tang Tang. Tang Tang still\nfelt uneasy. At the Yin family, there\nwere internal realm martial artists\nprotecting us, leaving there won't be as\nsafe. She looked at Quinton, sighing\nwearily. I'm starting to regret doing\nthis crazy thing with Mississippi. At\nthis moment, Tranmack appeared, waving\nMiss Yen. Tang Tang assessed him,\nthinking, although Missian Quinn Ton\nisn't someone who only cares about\nlooks, this fiance of hers looks too\nordinary. She observed more carefully\nfeeling, but he has an aura of having\nweathered storms. Is he really that\nignorant and incompetent dandy? Quinton\ncoldly walked past Tranmack, saying,\n\"Take me to where you live.\" He\nimmediately replied, \"Okay.\" After\narriving home, Tranmack asked in\nconfusion. \"You two plan stay here? Not\nrenting a hotel?\" Tang Tang blurted out,\n\"Miss must stay by your side.\" She was\nstartled, hurriedly correcting herself\nin embarrassment. \"I mean, hotels aren't\nsafe.\" Tang Tang pointed at Tranmack and\nwarned, \"Since Miss came to Saitang, you\nmust bear the responsibility of\nprotecting her safety.\" Tran Mack said\nunhappily, \"Fine, you two sleep here.\nI'll go out to sleep.\" Tang Tang was so\nangry her face turned red, daring to\nfrown at me. Truly ungrateful. Quinton\nfinally spoke politely. Sorry for the\ntrouble. As Tran Matt cleaned up, he\nthought, \"Luckily, I chose a\none-bedroom, one living room apartment.\nOtherwise, I'd be sleeping in a yard\nnow.\" Tang Tang continued to warn him.\nI'm going out to buy some things. I warn\nyou. Keep your hands to yourself. If I\nfind out you bullied, miss, I won't\nspare you. Tramac replied, \"Rest\nassured, I'm not that kind of person.\"\nTang Tang was still uneasy. Also, before\nI return, you absolutely must not leave\nMiss by half a step. There are many\npeople hoping for Miss to have an\naccident. Quinton spoke to reassure her.\nTang Tang, you go. I trust his\ncharacter. Tramac glanced annoyed. Seems\nlike my peaceful life ends here. A\nmoment later, Tang Tang left. Tramac\nasked Quinton, \"Want some water?\" She\nreplied, \"Drank on the high-speed\ntrain.\" Tramac responded, \"Oh.\" Then the\ntwo fell into silence again, not knowing\nwhat to say. Quinton thought, \"That\narrogant, rude Dandy who quit the exam\nhalfway and the Tram Mac before my eyes\nare completely different.\" Tram Mac was\ncalculating in his heart. Currently, the\nheaven and earth origin energy in the\njade of the spirit gathering array is\nalmost exhausted. I must quickly find\nnew jade. He closed his eyes to focus,\nbut it's hard to find jade that meets\nthe requirements. Seems I still have to\nfind that nominal disciple to ask. Might\nas well teach him some Dowist techniques\nto avoid his cultivation being too poor.\nTranmack glanced at Quinton and this Yin\nfamily eldest miss too. He speculated.\nIt seems that due to my rebirth, destiny\nhas undergone some small changes. The\nfeeling of not being able to foresee the\nfuture makes one feel a bit dangerous.\nAt this moment, Quinton opened her mouth\nto ask, \"Aren't you curious? Are you\ncurious why I suddenly sought you out?\"\nTramac also felt surprised. She said\nsoftly, \"Actually, I don't know either.\nIt's just that I don't want my fate to\nbe manipulated by others.\" Tramac just\nsaid, \"Yeah.\" Thus, both fell into an\nawkward silence again. Quinton turned\nand walked away in a huff. This guy\nreally doesn't know how to talk. At this\ntime, the moon was clear and the wind\nwas cool, only to see Tang Tang sticking\nher head out from behind the door,\nsecretly observing Tramac. Suddenly,\nTang Tang felt inexplicably annoyed,\nslamming the door shut with a bang. At\nthis moment, Tranmack pensively opened\nhis eyes. Then, he walked out of the\nhouse for a stroll. Tranmack stood alone\nin the late night, speaking up, \"Since\nyou're here, show yourselves.\" As soon\nas he finished speaking, a group of\nmasked assassins landed simultaneously.\nOne of them spoke, \"Kid, your vigilance\nis quite high.\" Tang Tang hurriedly ran\nout, saying to him, \"You protect Miss\nWell, let me deal with them.\" She\nshouted loudly. \"Who sent you?\" They\ndidn't answer Tang Tang, but burst in a\nlaughter. Quick fight, quick win. Finish\noff this wretched girl first, then deal\nwith that brat later. Once we're done,\nwe can taste the flavor of ha doo's\nnumber one beauty. Tang Tang angrily\nswung her fist. Dream on. The assassin\npraised. Not bad. So young yet such good\ncultivation. Your future would surely be\neven stronger. Pity, you won't have a\nfuture. Finished speaking. They shouted\nin unison and rushed forward. The group\nimmediately besieged Tang Tang. She\nquickly retreated to dodge the attacks.\nTang Tang shouted angrily. Five peak\nexternal realm martial artists. You\nreally know how to play. Who on earth\nsent you? An assassin swung his fist\nforward, gritting his teeth. Wait until\nyou're in the underworld, then ask the\nking of hell. Tang Tang hurriedly\nshouted. Tranmack, take Miss away\nquickly. Take her back to the Yin\nfamily. I'll bring up the rear.\nSuddenly, Tranmax's figure behind her\nvanished in a flash. In the blink of an\neye, Tranac had rushed in front of that\nassassin, blocking his fist. Trax's\ncounter punch exploded with terrifying\npower, shattering the assassin's bones\ninstantly. Tranmax swung his hand,\nthrowing him far away. That assassin\nimmediately screamed in panic. He is\ngreat success internal realm. Situation\nis bad. Retreat quickly. The others were\ndoubtful, but he's just a teenager. How\ncan he be great success internal realm?\nThey immediately shouted, \"Run!\" At this\nmoment, Tranmax spoke up. Since you've\ncome, he kicked an enemy flying.\nContinuing, \"Then don't think about\nleaving.\" One by one, they were kicked\nflying by Tranmack. The remaining few\ncould only stand and watch, mouth agape.\nThe next second, Tramac appeared right\nbehind them. An assassin unconsciously\nfroze. Both of them were also kicked\naway by Tramac. One assassin lying on\nthe ground trembled, terrified,\nquestioning Tranmack, \"Who exactly are\nyou? Why interfere in the Yin family's\nbusiness? He just coldly replied, \"What\nI do? Don't I need to explain to you?\"\nTranmack raised his voice. \"Who sent\nyou?\" The assassin lying on the ground\ngradually lost consciousness. Tranmax\nsaid disappointedly took suicide poison\nagain. He turned to Tang Tang and asked,\n\"Who exactly want your lives? Sparing no\nexpense to hire these death warriors.\"\nShe was also confused. I don't know\neither. There are many people who want\nto harm Mississippi. Tang Tang asked\nhim, \"How do we handle these bodies?\"\nTramac replied, \"No need to worry.\nSomeone will come and clean up.\"\nTranmack stated firmly, \"The mastermind\ncertainly won't let their identities be\nexposed.\" Very quickly, it was the next\nday. Sunlight filled the courtyard. By\nthis time, Tang Tang had woken up.\nQuinton worriedly asked Tang Tang, \"Why\nis your face so pale? Did you not sleep\nwell?\" She hurriedly explained, \"It's\nnothing. Probably just a cold. They'll\nbe fine in 2 days. Tranmax suddenly\nappeared saying, \"I bought breakfast.\nYou two eat.\" He handed Tang Tang an\nitem saying, \"Take this origin nurturing\npill. It's good for you.\" She replied,\n\"Thank you.\" Then Tramac picked up a bag\nand said, \"I have some business out. You\ntwo make yourselves at home.\" Tang Tang\nimmediately said, \"Wait, let me go with\nyou.\" Quinton was puzzled. Why do I have\nto go with him? Tang Tang scratched her\nhead, smiling awkwardly. Because because\nI feel a bit unwell, afraid I'm\npowerless. Just let Tran Mack protect\nMrs. Safety. Yin Quinn Ton turned\naround, raising an eyebrow in confusion,\nstaring at her and interrogating. Oh,\nyou can even say such words. Tang Tang\nknew she was being a bit irresponsible,\nso she smiled fawningly to persuade.\nIt's true, miss. Just listen to me.\nYintent could only shake her head and\nsigh. All right, I'll listen to you.\nThen I will go with him. At this moment,\nTran Max stood aside, glancing at the\ntwo, complaining inwardly. I still have\nbusiness out. If she follows, it will\nsurely add so much trouble. But in the\nend, Tran Max still took her along,\nrelying on his extraordinary memory.\nTranmack found the old man's residence.\nIn the living room, two steaming cups of\ntea were placed on the table. The old\ntowist Tran tongue too bowed to the\nside, smiling respectfully. \"Greetings,\nmaster. Please forgive this disciple for\nasking presumptuously, \"Is this your\nwife?\" Tramac had just lifted the teacup\nfor a sip when he spat all out, coughing\na few times, waving his hand to refute,\n\"Don't talk nonsense. She is a friend of\nmine.\" Yen Quinton sat beside him,\nglancing at Tranmack. A flash of\nsurprise, disappointment, and suspicion\ncrossing her eyes, hard to detect. Just\na friend? Old Tais Tran didn't look at\nher curiously anymore, turning to ask\nTranmack. I wonder what business master\nhas with me. Last time I left in too\nmuch of a hurry, forgot to instruct many\nthings. Indeed, saying it now, Tranmack\nfelt a bit guilty. For instance,\nforgetting to ask his name. Old Talis\nTran immediately clased his hands in\nsalute. Please teach me master. This\ndisciple is all ears. Seeing old Tauist\nTran, such an elderly person being so\nrespectful to Tranmack. As a modern\nperson, she really couldn't stand the\nsight. An old man performing a grand\nsalute to a young man looked really\nunsightly. Feeling it was both boring\nand awkward to stay, she stood up to\nleave first. You two talk, I'll go out\nfor a walk. When she left, Tramac felt\nmuch more comfortable. So he asked,\n\"What is your name?\" Reporting to\nmaster. This disciple entered the Daist\ntemple at 51. Daist name is Tran tongue\nTuesday. Tran tongue 2. Good. From now\non, I will call you that. This is a\nbasic cultivation method I especially\nprepared for you. If within 3 days you\ncan reach the first level of\ninducingqing chi into the body, I will\nconsider officially accepting you as a\ndisciple. Old Tais Tran immediately\nknelt on the ground, hands raised above\nhis head, respectfully receiving the\nsecret manual from Tranmack, shouting\nloudly. Tran tongue too thanks master.\nTranmac looked at him, nodding in\nsatisfaction. But the very next second,\nhis face darkened, his voice icy,\nthreatening with killing intent. My\ncultivation method must not be leaked,\notherwise I will definitely make your\nsoul scatter. Hearing the voice as cold\nas if echoing from the netherworld, old\nTowers Tran couldn't help but be\nstunned, his face turning pale,\nhurriedly replying, \"Yes, from today,\nthis life of mine belongs to Master. If\nthere are any orders, this disciple will\ndefinitely obey.\" At this moment, the\noppressive aura around Tranmack also\ndissipated. Tramac nodded. \"Stand up.\"\nHe casually sat down on the sofa asking,\n\"I've used up the jade stone from last\ntime. Do you have any more?\" If master\nneeds it, you have to go to Black\nWaterpool at Lingu Mountain to find it,\nbut there's a fierce monster at\nBlackwater Poolool. Extremely dangerous.\nThis disciple thinks Master could go to\nChaotic Stone Beach to check first.\nMaybe there's what you want. Tranmack\nlowered his eyes, calculating based on\nthe old Talist words. The monster at\nBlackwater Poolool is merely a wild\nbeast that absorbed the essence of\nheaven and earth to gain spiritual\nintelligence. But with my current\nstrength, I'm afraid it's hard to kill\nit. Have to wait until entering chi\ncondensation second stage to plan. All\nright, arrange the time and route to go\nto chaotic stone beach as fast as\npossible. Old towers tran respectfully\nreplied as you command. All right, I'm\nleaving first. Just focus on\ncultivating. I'll come to check your\nprogress on Saturday. Just as Tranmack\nwas about to leave, old Tauist Tran\nhesitated for a long time behind him\nbefore daring to speak up to keep him.\nMaster, this disciple has a request.\nSpeak from today. This disciple wants to\nfollow by master's side to toil like a\nbeast of burden serving master. Hope\nmaster grants this wish. Tranmack\nnarrowed his eyes at him, naturally\nunderstanding this intention. Wanting to\nget closer to me isn't bad, but that\none-bedroom apartment already holds two\ntroublesome spirits. Sigh. Tranmax\nsighed inwardly, waved his hand, turned\naround, and said, \"Wait until back from\nchaotic stone beach. Then we'll see.\"\nHearing the approval in Tranmax's words,\nthe old towist immediately bowed\nexcitedly, clasping his hands and\nshouting, \"Thank you, master, for\ngranting this rumble.\" The entire\nbustling city, brilliant with lights,\nwas now covered by a sky of swirling\ndark clouds. Thunder and lightning\nintertwining. Bolts of lightning tore\nacross the sky. Rain pouring down. In\nthe backyard, a cold age hand placed on\nthe main gate. An old man with white\nhair, red eyes, smiling, a weird,\nferocious smile stepped into the rain.\nThe old man focused his gaze, internal\nforce wrapping his whole body, easily\npassing through the wall to enter. As\nfor Tranmack inside the house, though\nlying with eyes closed, he couldn't\nsleep, brows furrowed tight. He just got\nup, intending to go to the yard when he\nmet Tang Tang running hurly towards him.\nI'll go up first. If I can't beat him,\nthen you take action. The two walked\nunder the eaves, looking at the man\nwhose body was emitting a faint layer of\nenergy aura. Tang Tang widened her eyes\nin exclamation. Rain doesn't wet\nclothes. Peak internal realm. She\nimmediately clasped her hands.\nExpression grave. Senior. With your\ncultivation, you could step into the\ntransformation realm at any time. I\nwonder what business brings you here.\nThe old man replied casually. Can enter\nanytime yet cannot enter in the end just\na handful of yellow earth. This old man\ndoesn't have many years left to live.\nOnly entering the transformation realm\ncan extend life. This old man wants to\nborrow something from the yin family\ngirl to make a transaction. I wonder\nwhat senior wants to borrow. If my miss\nhas it, she will surely offer it with\nboth hands. She certainly has it because\nwhat this old man wants to borrow is her\nlife. Tang Tang frowned, asking\nvigilantly. Who sent you? The old man\nshrugged, not minding explaining. The\ncondition they offered moved me, so I\nhad to discard this old face to act\nagainst a brat. She lowered her voice,\nreminding Tranmack beside her. We aren't\nhis match. You quickly take Miss away.\nTransmac glanced at her indifferently,\nstill maintaining a calm expression, not\nleaving at all, but turning to ask the\nold man. I'm a bit curious. What\ncondition could move you so much? The\ncorner of the old man's mouth lifted,\nrevealing a smile, both eerie and full\nof joy. A spot to enter Void Mountain.\nAs long as one can survive walking out\nof Void Mountain, one will surely become\na grandmaster. Tang Tang exclaimed in\nsurprise. Void Mountain surely become a\ngrandmaster. Tranmack looked at the old\nman, face still calm, but a bit of\ninterest rose in his heart. So, where is\nVoid Mountain? Don't know. Wait until I\ncomplete the mission. They will\nnaturally tell me. They Who are they?\nWhy should I tell you? All right, go to\nthe underworld. Whoosh. The old man's\nwords just ended. The figure flashed in\nthe rain, then vanished. The next\ninstant, he appeared in front of Tang\nTang, choking her throat tightly. Tang\nTang gritted her teeth, eyes wide,\nwanting to struggle but unable to move\nat all. Until just now, I always thought\nthat although there was a huge gap\nbetween me and the peak internal realm,\nif I fought to the death, I could still\nhold on. But in reality, I don't even\nhave the strength to resist. Miss, I'm\nsorry. Seeing a palm about to strike the\ntop of her head, she gave up resistance\nand closed her eyes to wait for death.\nHowever, the next second, a dull thud\nrang out. After a while, Tang Tang still\ndidn't feel any pain. Puzzled, she\nslowly opened her eyes, only to see the\nold man standing in a days a short\ndistance away from her. \"I didn't expect\nyou to be able to block me. You hid your\nskills quite deep. Over here, raindrops\nfalling just tens of centimeters from\nTranmax's shoulder were bounced off by a\nlayer of trueqi.\" Tranmax expression\nremained unchanged as he coldly\nthreatened, \"Tell me their identities,\nand I will spare your life.\" The old man\nopposite suddenly lowered his head and\nchuckled. That eerie laughter carried a\nterrifying pressure. Haha. Haha. Kid,\nsince this old man started his career,\nno one has ever dared to speak to me\nlike that. You are the first and also\nthe last. Having said that, the old man\nlaunched himself into action. Rushing in\nfront of Tramac, Tramac simply bent his\nknees and swung his arm, gathering force\nto block the old man's full powered\npunch. Tramax's body stood firm as a\nrock, only stepping back slightly.\nMeanwhile, the old man looked horrified,\npushed back, stumbling more than 10\nsteps by the recoil force before barely\nstanding firm. He widened his eyes,\nlooking at Tranmack in shock. Peak\ninternal realm up was se. Even if you\nstarted cultivating from your mother's\nwomb, it's impossible. But the very next\nsecond, he laughed crazily again.\nHowever, if I defeat you and find the\nsecret on you, then this old man can\nalso become a grandmaster. Tramac looked\nat him coldly mocking. I'm afraid you\ndon't have that ability. You old trash.\nThe old man dropped his hands, relaxing\nhis whole body, swaying in the rain. In\nan instant, his speed got faster and\nfaster, even creating hundreds of after\nimages. He gritted out each word,\nseemingly generating countless hands\naround him, patting towards Tranmac.\nCloud pushing handingai\ncloud pushing hand. He is Bang Singwin,\nthe famous cloud pushing hand expert of\nthe Northwest. Countless elucory palm\nshadows struck, but Tranmack remained\ncomposed and at ease. His hands moved\nslightly, throwing two punches,\naccurately blocking the old man's two\nreal palms. Just like that, in just a\nfew short seconds, the two of them, one\nattacking and one defending, exchanged\nhundreds of moves. When they separated\nagain, the old man's face was pale,\nterrified to the extreme. You were\nactually able to block this old man's\ncloud, pushing hand. How exactly did you\ndo it? Tranmack narrowed his eyes at\nhim, not answering, smiling with\nsatisfaction inwardly. The test was\ncomplete. If judging only by the amount\nof spiritual energy, his current first\nlevel ofqi condensation cultivation was\nat most equal to a small success\ninternal realm martial artist. But in\nterms of quality, his spiritual power\nwas comparable to a peak internal realm\nmartial artist. The cold rain and the\npressure radiating from the two great\nexperts made the surrounding air seemed\nto stagnate for a long time, only to be\nbroken by a sentence from Tramac. It's\nover. A faint stream of trueqi suddenly\nexploded like an erupting volcano. A\nsurging momentum enveloping his body.\nHeavenly mystic divine fist first form.\nMountain breaker Tran Mack assumed a\nstance, diving straight down from midair\ntowards the old man. The old man below\nwas so terrified his eyes bulged. In his\neyes, the arm striking down looked like\na giant axe several meters long. What\npower is this? What martial art is this?\nI've never seen it before. This old man\nwill fight you to the death, facing the\nthreat of life and death. The old man\ngritted his teeth tightly, burning all\nthe spiritual power in his body,\nattempting to block the strike before\nhim. Only a fut sound was heard. In an\ninstant, before the old man could even\nact, his eyes stared wide open, and his\nentire body was split in two by Tranmax\nbare hand. Standing nearby, Tang Tang\ncouldn't suppress her nausea, her face\npale as she covered her mouth. Ugg.\nTrramax stood there calmly glancing at\nthe corpse on the ground, thinking to\nhimself, using the cultivation of chi\ncondensation level one to perform the\nheavenly mystic divine fist is indeed\nstill a bit forced. I couldn't control\nthe force well. I didn't intend to kill\nhim. I still had questions to ask. Early\nthe next morning at the ancestral land\nof the Lou family, one of the six super\nfamilies, the granddaughter of the\ncurrent family head, Lu Mong Dao, spoke\nwith a look of shock. Uncle Vo, do you\nmean there's a transformation realm\ngrandmaster beside that from the\nYen family? The elder opposite nodded\nslightly, replying cautiously. 10 years\nago, Bang Singwin was already at the\npeak internal realm. The person who\ncould kill him in one move can only be a\ngrandmaster. We thought that\nleaving the Yin family on her own was\nseeking death. I really didn't expect\nher to have a grandmaster protecting\nher. So, killing her is almost\nimpossible. That's right. Because we\nbasically cannot afford a higher\ngrandmaster. To kill Yin Quinton, we\neither bribe the mysterious Grandmaster\nbeside her or arrange an assassination\nwhen that person is not with Yin\nQuinton. She punched the table next to\nher in resentment, gritting her teeth as\nshe continued, \"Uncle Vo, you must help\nme. I absolutely cannot let Yin Quinton\nreturn a Hadu alive. At the same time,\nat the Namkung family in Hadu, the\ngrandson of the Nam Kung family head,\nNamkung Vanlau, said anxiously,\n\"Grandpa, the people you sent all\nfailed. They are too weak. Sitting\nopposite him was a white-haired but\nimposing elder, the head of the Namkong\nfamily.\" Nam Kung Vong. It is because\nthere is an expert protecting Yin\nQuinton. Otherwise, would the Yin family\nrest assured letting that girl run out\nalone?\nhis face gloomy. If external realm\nexperts don't work, find internal realm\nones. If internal realm experts don't\nwork, find a grandmaster. Nam Kung Vong\nglanced at his only grandson. Finally,\nunable to hold back a scolding.\nInsulent. Do you think grandmasters are\neasy to hire? Martial artists have the\npride of martial artists. Nam Kung\nVanlauo instead of being afraid after\nbeing scolded had tears welling up in\nhis eyes rushing straight into the\nelers's arms crying grandpa I don't care\nI must have yin quinton or else I'll run\naway from home the elder looked at his\ngrandson hugging him tightly his eyes\nfull of helplessness sighing inwardly\nsigh don't I wish for that too if you\ncan get yin quinton the status of our\nNam Kong family will be firmly\nconsolidated elsewhere in a main hall of\nthe Yin family Father, people in hot du\nhave already made a move on Quinton.\nCall her back. The elders sitting on the\nsofa, who is also Yin Quinton's\ngrandfather. Yan and Trong sneered. No\nworries. Those people were all killed by\na mysterious grandmaster. Quinton is\nvery safe. The middle-aged man sitting\nopposite was none other than Yin\nQuinton's father, Yen Man Shuan. He\nrolled his eyes slightly, saying in\nsurprise, \"You mean there's a Marshall\nGrandmaster beside Tramac?\" Yen and\nTrong stroked his beard with a cunning\nlook, chuckling. Who else but a Marshall\nGrandmaster could teach a teenager to\nbecome an internal realm martial artist.\nIt seems Tranax's potential far exceeds\nmy expectations. Just like Quint Ton\ncontinue nurturing feelings with him at\nthe largest stone gambling venue in\nSaitang District Treasure Hall. Tran\nMack walked in front with Yin Quinton\nbeside him and behind them, Tran Tongu\nwalked side by side with Tang Tang. The\nfour of them entered the main hall\ntogether. Yin, Quinn, Ton slowed down,\nwaiting for Tang Tang to get close\nbefore whispering a complaint. Why must\nwe follow Tramac? Can't the two of us go\nfor a stroll ourselves? Tantang\nme, just listen to me. Tran tongue too\nquickened his steps, reporting to\nTranmack with a beaming face. Master, I\nhave sold my house and all my assets.\nFrom now on, I will follow by your side\nand serve you wholeheartedly. Tranmack\nnodded, glancing at the old man. Good.\nYou can be considered very determined.\nNot bad. Successfully guiding chi into\nthe body within three days. Yes, I\nsucceeded on the second night. I finally\ndidn't fail master's teaching. Right. In\npublic places from now on, just call me\nyoung master. Yes, young master. This\ntreasure hall was the largest stone\ngambling venue in the district. Those\nwho came to participate in stone\ngambling were all from the wealthy\nclass. Tranmax scanned the stones of\nvarious shapes and colors displayed on\nthe shelves, thinking to himself, \"These\nthings are actually not bad.\" Just then,\nanother group of people walked in from\noutside, led by three attractive and\nbeautiful girls. The Stone Gambling\nFestival is about to start, and Kadette\nstood by the side, frowning slightly and\nsighing. This is a hobby for the rich.\nWe can't afford to play. At this moment,\nLambda in a dashing suit chimed in. It's\nokay. Looking doesn't cost money. Let's\njust walk around here. Maybe today you\nguys will meet someone from the lamb\nfamily. As soon as he finished speaking\nand Cod Deette's eyes widened, shining\nwith excitement. You mean the Lamb\nfamily? The number one family? The Lamb\nfamily? Lamb Dao nodded affirmatively.\nOf course. Suddenly at this moment,\nDuong Tan Tan shouted loudly, pointing\nher finger to a corner of the hall. Look\nquickly. Isn't that Tramac? Why is he\nhere? Lamb Dao looked in the direction\nshe pointed. It was indeed Tranmack. So\nhe said with a face full of disdain,\n\"This Brad is definitely here at the\nStone Gambling venue to try his luck.\"\nHowever, this isn't something a\nhillbilly like him can afford to play.\nAnd Kadit stood by the side, looking\nover, also frowning, saying\nsuspiciously, \"What is Tranmack doing at\nthe stone gambling venue?\" Only Mo Dong\nYini had a face full of unconcealed joy,\nrunning quickly to Tranmac's side and\ncalling out, \"Tran Mack.\" Tranmack was\nlooking intently in this direction when\na familiar call came to his ears. He\nturned his head in surprise to look.\nIt's Yin Ni. She stood beside Tranmac,\nsmiling. Couldiet and I were free and\nwere dragged here by TNTN to watch the\nexcitement. Are you here to watch the\nexcitement too? Tranmack looked at her,\nsmiling slightly, and casually found an\nexcuse. No, I want to buy two stones and\nwait until Tet to give to my father.\nLamb Dao standing not far away heard\nthis and immediately approached with a\nface full of contempt saying someone\nlike you wants to buy stones do you have\nmoney dung yini frowned turning around\nto glare at Lamb Dao speak politely lamb\nDao mocked in a weird tone but still\ngave her face I'm just telling the truth\nat this moment Yen Quintin Ton stood by\nthe side took off her sunglasses and\nflashed a smile that could bewitch all\nliving beings\nare these your classmates they look a\nbit overly enthusiastic, don't they? As\nsoon as she revealed her face, the men\npresent stared infatuatedly, unblinking,\nlost in admiration. A great beauty, a\nsuper great beauty, truly a goddess. The\npeople on Incadi's side also couldn't\nbelieve there was such a beautiful girl.\nTheir eyes widened in shock and\nsuspicion. She's so beautiful. How does\nTramac know such a beautiful girl?\nTranmack looked at her, then looked\naround, curling his lips slightly,\nthinking to himself, \"This girl, Yin\nQuinton, she definitely thinks the world\nisn't chaotic enough.\" Yiani recovered\nfrom her gaze. Her eyes looking at Yin\nQuinton filled with hostility. \"Who are\nyou?\" Yinqu saw through the little\ngirl's thoughts all too clearly. She\nchuckled softly, stepped forward, and\nlinked her arm with Tramax. \"He, I am\nhis future fiance. Hasn't he introduced\nme to you guys yet?\" Lambda and the\nthree other boys looked terrified, their\njaws almost dropping to the ground as\nthey exclaimed, \"What? Future fiance?\"\nThe girls on Encodiad's side also\nwidened their eyes, their expressions\nidentical. \"Huh? Huh? Huh? Tramac, is\nshe? Is she really your future fiance?\"\nTran Mack casually and calmly denied.\nThe engagement was already anulled.\nHearing this, Emo Dong Yin Ni, who was\nstammering a second ago, beamed with a\nbright smile the next, \"Oh, anulled.\"\nBut at this moment, Yin Quinton was\nstill holding his arm. Her words hiding\ndissatisfaction. Who said it's an old my\nengagement? Yin Quinton's engagement. No\none else can decide for me. Lamb Dao\nover here was suddenly stunned and\nshouted, \"Y Quinton, you are the number\none beauty of Hadu.\" Yin Quinton.\nImmediately after, he pointed at Tranmac\nwith a gloating expression and mocked. A\ncountry bumpkin dares to touch the\nnumber one beauty of Hadu. Tranmack,\nI'll keep my eyes wide open to see how\nyou die. Yan Quinn Ton pressed closer to\nTranmack, dropping a bombshell. What is\nthere to not dare? Tranmack and I are\nalready living together. As soon as she\nfinished speaking, Tranac glanced at her\nspeechlessly. The others were so shocked\nthey couldn't speak, their mouths gaping\nopen. Even Tang Tang, standing behind\nstared with wide eyes in astonishment.\nMiss actually dared to say that.\nTranmack frowned tightly from beginning\nto end, muttering to himself. Yin\nQuinton, \"She definitely didn't say that\nbecause she likes me.\" Yini looked at\nTranmack with expectant eyes and asked\nsoftly, \"Tran Mack, is what she said\ntrue? Don't need to lie to you?\" Yan\nQuinton answered for Tranmack, hugging\nhis arm even tighter as if to prove her\nwords were not fiction. Tranmack raised\nan eyebrow, glanced at her, then frowned\nto explain and correct. \"Don't listen or\nnonsense. She is just temporarily\nrenting a room at my place. After\nspeaking, Tranmack turned his head\nhelplessly to glare at her, threatening,\n\"If you cause any more trouble, don't\nblame me for kicking you back to Hadu.\"\nYan Quinn Ton met Tranmax's gaze without\nfear. You dare. Tranmac didn't want to\nstand there arguing with her, so he\npulled his hand out directly and turned\nto leave with a headache. \"You guys\ncarry on then? I'm leaving first.\" Tran\nTongu immediately followed Tranmac,\nasking in a low voice. Young master,\nthose three young men insulted you just\nnow. Do they need to be taught a lesson?\nTranmack shook his head. No need. Young\nmaster is magnanimous. The two walked\ntowards a main gate when suddenly they\nheard a call. Tranmack slowed down,\nlooked up, and saw it was an\nacquaintance. Mr. Tran. So Van Hung\nlooked delighted, clasping his hands\nrespectfully in greeting. I didn't\nexpect to meet Mr. TR here. It is truly\nan honor. For the sake of politeness,\nTranmack replied faintly. What a\ncoincidence regarding Transmac's\nattitude. So Van Hung didn't mind at all\nand even smiled back. Haha. He\ncalculated in his heart. This Tran Mack\ncould cure old Master Kim's illness. He\nis absolutely worthy of respect. I\noffended Tran Mack before I must seize\nthe opportunity to mend the\nrelationship. So Van Hung took the\ninitiative to find topic. Does Mr. TR\nalso have research on stone gambling?\nWhy don't you help me take a look? I\nwill definitely offer a handsome reward.\nWhile he was still worried Trans Tranm\nwould coldly refuse. Unexpectedly, Tran\nsmiled slightly and agreed. \"Then I\nshall respectfully obey.\" Tran sneered\ninwardly. Who wouldn't want to make\nmoney? Just then, a voice over the\nloudspeaker echoed through the hall.\n\"Welcome everyone to Treasure Hall's\nstone gambling assembly. The stone\ngambling assembly will now begin.\" So,\nVan Hung stepped forward quickly,\nextending his hand to invite Mr. TR. The\nstone gambling assembly has started.\nLet's go over there. As the three left,\nhe kept a smile on his face walking\nbeside them, making outsiders think the\ntwo were close friends. Coincidentally,\nEmo Dung Yin Ni's group also saw this\nscene. Isn't that so Van Hung? And Kadet\ncouldn't help but frown slightly,\nbecoming tense. He also came to\nparticipate in the stone gambling\nassembly. Seeing this, Yani beside her,\njust comforted softly. Don't be afraid.\nWith Tranmack here, he won't dare to do\nanything. A moment later, the seats\ninside the hall were packed. On the\nstage, a bearded bald man smiled and\nsaid, \"The stone gambling assembly\nbegins. Each bid increment must not be\nless than 10,000. At this time, Tranmac\nand so Van Hung had also settled into\nthe VIP seating area. Except for him,\nEmo Dong, Yiani group, and even Yin\nQuinton had to stand in line outside to\nwatch at this moment.\" So Van Hung\nleaned close to Tranmack and whispered,\n\"The owner of this treasure hall in\nterms of strength is slightly stronger\nthan me. In this entire land of Kian\nGeep, he can be ranked in the top 10.\"\nMeanwhile, on the stage, two burly men\nhad carried out a stone. Coten and\nsmiled radiantly and said, \"A raw stone.\nStarting price 500,000.\" Very quickly,\nsomeone bid. It was the richest man in\nKand Duong. Hungbat dong 550,000. The\nnext person to bid sat a few rows away\nfrom him, the eldest young master of the\nnumber one financial group in Lamb Chow,\nYoung Master Lamb, 600,000. Tranmack\nglanced at the activity over there, and\nasked suspiciously, \"Is this Lamb family\nvery rich?\" So Van Hung spoke while\nassociating with the terrifying nature\nof the Lamb family. So Van Hungs face\nimmediately became unnatural. If\ndiscussing financial assets, actually\neveryone isn't that different. But the\nlamb family possesses a profound and\nmysterious strength that makes people\nweary. Tramac looked over there with an\nunchanged expression. But his gaze\nstopped on Elder Chon standing next to\nLamb Ty, a terrifying existence who had\nreached the realm of inner strength,\nsmall success. This was the foundation\nof a Lamb family's power. Next, the\nperson who spoke up didn't bid, but used\na mocking voice coming from two Don Han.\nHe loudly affirmed with certainty. This\nstone is just big in size. There's\nnothing inside. So Van Hung looked at\nthat person, narrowed his eyes and\nthought, then said, \"This Tong Han is a\nlocal tyrant. His strength is very\nformidable. He is a rival of treasure\nhall in me.\" Hearing him say that,\nTranmac just glanced over casually. His\nfocus placed on the tall, thin old man\nprotecting two Dong Han. I'm afraid that\nperson and the inc corpse sect group on\nthe ancient stone platform are the same\nkind of cultivators. Coten and glared at\ntwo Dong Han in dissatisfaction and\nshouted loudly, \"Boss 2, you speak as if\nyou have x-ray vision. If you want to\nsabotage this stone gambling assembly,\nmy treasure hall does not welcome you.\"\nBeing scolded in front of everyone,\nTudong Han was not angry, just smiled\nmysteriously and said, \"If you don't\nbelieve it, then fine. Wait until the\nstone is cut and you'll know.\" Lamb Tan\nNai straightened his back, crossed his\narms and sneered. Boss 2, are you saying\nthat I lamb have no eyes for this? It's\njust 600,000. Buying it for fun doesn't\nmatter. On the other side, Lamb Dao was\nstanding behind Yin Ni's group, looking\nup at Lamb Tenny's imposing manner,\nlaughing excitedly. See that? That's how\ndoineering my Lamb family is. And\nKadette and Yin Ni glanced at him, then\nlooked at Lamb Tan Ny, both\nunderstanding one thing clearly in their\nhearts. Lamb Dao claimed to be from the\nLamb family, but the Lamb family didn't\nconsider him anything at all. The people\nof the Lamb family sat inside while he\nhad to stand outside. That was the\nclearest proof at this moment. So Van\nHung also whispered to ask for\nTranmack's opinion beside him. Mr. Tran,\nwhat do you think of this raw stone?\nTramac just gently shook his head. Not\ngood. Then let the Lamb family have it.\nInside, Lamb Teni looked up and waved at\nCo Tinan saying, \"Boss Co. Since no one\nis raising the price, cut the stone. Cop\ntenon looked at him feeling resentful\nand indignant in his heart. If two Dong\nHan hadn't interfered, how could this\nraw stone sell for only 600,000? How\nhateful. The staff received the order\nand immediately began cutting the stone.\nThe stone was cut open, revealing that\ninside was indeed just an ordinary rock.\nSure enough, there wasn't even a bit of\ngreen. Amidst the buzzing discussions,\nsomeone curiously asked, \"What is green?\nIt's the gemstone. Lambian Nye frowned\nand gritted his teeth. He didn't care\nabout the money, but he felt a bit\nembarrassed, muttering, there really is\nnothing. Two Dong Han raised his\neyebrows smuggly, laughing loudly to\nmock. If you don't listen to the\nelderly, you'll suffer right before your\neyes. The stone debris on the stage was\nquickly cleared away to make room for\nthe second raw stone. Cotin in this time\nsimply waved his hand to announce the\nprice. Second raw stone. Starting price\n1 million. This time the first person to\nbid was Tong Han, but he casually added\na comment. This Rosstone has green. It's\na gemstone of not bad quality, but it's\nworth at most 2 million. I bid 2\nmillion. Everyone looked towards him in\nan uproar. Discussing in low voices.\nShould we make a move? He's so\nconfident. Don't compete with him. Let's\nobserve a bit more first. Lamb Ten Nye\nglared at him and bid. I just don't\nbelieve in this evil. I bid 2 million\nand 10,000. Tudong Han remained calm,\nsmiling lightly, \"Fine, I yield to you.\"\nThis time, the anxious person was co-\ntin on stage. He hurriedly waved his\nhand and ordered loudly, \"Cut the\nstone.\" When the outer layer of stone\nwas cut away, the whole hall saw a\ngemstone of moderate size. The noise\nrose once again. It really has it, and\nthe market price is indeed around 2\nmillion. Lamb Tien Nai looked at Tu Dong\nHan with strange eyes and said, \"Boss 2,\nit seems you brought an expert with you\nthis time. The corners of two Dong Han's\nmouth lifted, his words humble but full\nof arrogance. Not at all. Not at all. I\nwas just lucky. So Van Hung looked at\nhim and also frowned, secretly alarmed.\nThis two Dong Han came prepared. After\nthat, every time a raw stone was carried\nup, two Dong Han took the lead, bidding\nas if reading from a menu. At this\npoint, Cotin was so angry his whole body\nwas trembling. Fifth raw stone starting\nprice. Before he could finish speaking,\nTudong Han directly raised his hand,\ncutting in. Inside is a piece of jasper\nworth at most 800,000. I bid 800,000.\nCotin and gritted his teeth. So angry\ntears were about to fall. Hateful. If\nkilling people wasn't illegal, I would\ndefinitely shoot him for 3 days and\nthree nights. Just as everyone was\ncertain this raw stone would belong to\nhim. Tranmack calmly spoke up. 1\nmillion. In an instant, everyone's eyes\nfocused on him and Kadett's group\nstanding outside was also stunned. Lamb\nDao's jaw dropped in disbelief. Did I\nhear wrong? Tramac, that piece of trash\nactually bid 1 million. Where did he get\nso much money? Mo Dung Yin Ni glared at\nhim. Tramac said he wanted to buy two\nstones, so he certainly has the money to\nbuy them. Lamb Dao gritted his teeth,\nhis tone gloomy yet agitated. He's\ndefinitely a scammer. I must expose him\nover here. So Van Hung also looked over\nin surprise, asking, \"Is Mr. Tran\ninterested in this raw stone?\" Tranmax\nsmiled faintly, nodding slightly. \"I'm\ndetermined to get it.\" A sinister glint\nflashed in two Dong Han's eyes as he\nsecretly assessed him. But a second\nlater, he hid it with a smiling face.\nHaha, kid. Inside this raw stone is just\nan ordinary piece of jasper. Basically\nnot worth 1 million. Even if you have\nmoney, you shouldn't waste it like that.\nWhy not give me face? How about it?\nTranmack just closed his eyes to rest\ncompletely ignoring him. More and more\npeople around looked towards him and\nwhispers of doubt rose accordingly. What\nis this young man's background? He\ndoesn't give two Dong Han any face at\nall. So Van Hong beside him consciously\ndarken his face glaring and speaking up\nfor Tramac. Surname too. You'd be dead\ndog. If you want to buy then raise the\nprice. If not then get lost. Don't talk\nnonsense. T Dong Han frowned, somewhat\napprehensive, forcing a dark face as he\nsaid, giving so van hung face. I yield\nto you. As soon as he finished speaking\nand sat down, the tall, thin old man\nbeside him leaned in and whispered a\nsound only the two of them could hear.\nAt this moment, Coten on the stone\nplatform had indescribable joy on his\nface, shouting loudly, \"1 million going\nonce, 1 million going twice, 1 million.\"\nJust as he was about to bang the gavvel\nto Dong Han suddenly shouted, \"Wait, I\ncannot yield this raw stone. I bid\n1,500,000.\"\nTranmac had no reaction, bidding\nimmediately after his words. 2 million\nto Dong Han stood up abruptly, his\nfierce appearance revealed as he glared\nat Tranmack. \"Kid, do you really want to\ngo against me?\" Tranm hadn't replied\nyet, but so Van Hong beside him was also\nfull of momentum, shouting angrily,\n\"Surname too, you dead dog. Who are you\nthreatening? I specifically want to go\nagainst you. I bid 3 million. Tudong Han\nwas so angry his face turned purple,\nglaring furiously at him and roaring.\nSurname. So, you old dog. Do you think\nI'm afraid of you? 4 million. At this\nmoment, everyone who heard their bids\nwas panicstricken, suspecting they had\nheard wrong. A piece of Jasper worth 4\nmillion. Or could it be that inside is\nnot Jasper at all, but a high-grade\ngemstone? Well, so Van hung beside him\nwas still hesitating. Tramac had calmly\nheld up five fingers. 5 million. On the\nstone platform, Coten Anne's eyes\nnarrowed into a line with a smile as he\nshouted towards him, \"5 million.\" To Don\nHan looked at him with hatred, gritting\nhis teeth, \"Brother, you are indeed\nwealthy and imposing. I yield this raw\nstone to you.\" Coat Tin and laughed\nloudly and shouted, \"5 million. Anyone\nelse raising the price?\" Just at this\nmoment, Lamb Tien Ny spoke up, a crafty\nsmile on his face. Wait, he looks just\nlike a poor student. Does he have that\nmuch money? Lamb Tan Ny said\ndisdainfully with Lamb Dao standing\nbehind him looking like he was enjoying\nthe show and wishing for chaos, gloating\nas he looked over, \"Brother, they\nsuspect you don't have money.\" These\nwords stunned Co Tinan. He awkwardly\nscratched his face, smiling as he asked\nback. Before Tranmack could speak, so\nVan Hung frowned and questioned, \"Old\nco, he is a guest of So Van Hung. Could\nI owe you money?\" Tranmack beside him\ntook a card out of his pocket, saying\ncalmly, \"There are 10 million in this\ncard. The password is six zeros.\" Seeing\nhim take out 10 million as lightly as\ntaking out a few cents to buy candy,\nimmediately shocked everyone endlessly.\n10 million. And even said the password\ntoo generous. Tran tongue too looked at\nTranmack with eyes full of surprise\nadding a few degrees of respect.\nThinking back in the young master's\neyes, \"Worldly wealth is basically not\nworth mentioning.\" Coten and took the\ncard from the staff member speaking up.\n\"All right, I will check it a bit to\nprove the brother's capability.\" Lamb\nTien Nye was somewhat apprehensive and\nsuspicious, turning to ask Lambda, \"Are\nyou sure he doesn't have money?\" Lambda\nnodded with a smile, extremely certain.\nYoung master rest assured. I studied\nwith him for three years. Don't I know\nhow much he's worth? A moment later,\nCoten and received a message from the\nstaff member, laughing loudly as he\nannounced. I have checked. There really\nare 10 million in the card. Lamb Ten Nai\nground his teeth, glaring at Lamb Dao\nand shouting, \"Bastard, dare to play\nme?\" Lamb Dao was so scared he sat\nheavily on the ground, exclaiming, \"How\nis that possible?\" over here. Duantien's\ngroup was also full of surprise, staring\nwideeyed. Why does Tramax suddenly have\nso much money? Yi glanced at him, only\nsmiling disdainfully. Lamb Dao just\ndoesn't want to see others doing better\nthan him. Certamite and Kadette frowned,\nlooking at Tranac with a heart full of\ndoubt. Why do I feel like Tranmac seems\nto be hiding a lot of secrets? Yin\nQuinton crossed her arms over her chest,\nraising her eyebrows and saying to Tang\nTang beside her, \"I didn't expect this\nbrat Tranmack to have quite a lot of\nmoney. When we get home, I must make him\nchange to a bigger room.\" Coten and\nlooked at Tranmack, that smile truly\nlooking like he was looking at the god\nof wealth. \"Brother, do you need this\nraw stone cut right here?\" Tramac\nimmediately nodded and answered, \"Cut?\"\nThen under everyone's attention, the raw\nstone gradually cracked open, revealing\na green shell. Under the green shell was\na gemstone the color of red wine,\ncrystal clear and glittering. Gasps\nechoed throughout the hall. This is a\nred star stone. There's even a catey\nblood diamond inside. Congratulations,\nbrother. What? A blood diamond this big?\nWouldn't it sell for over 200 million?\nThis kid's luck is too good. So Van Hung\nlaughed heartily. Congratulating.\nCongratulations, Mr. Tran. Next. Please\nhelp me choose Mr. Tran. Tranmack beside\nhim just calmly rested his chin on his\nhand, thinking to himself. It's just a\ngemstone containing fire attribute\norigin power. That's all. Meanwhile,\nCotin on the stone platform narrowed his\nsharp eyes, looking towards two Dong\nHan. Everyone, I'm afraid someone\nintentionally said beforehand that those\nraw stones weren't worth money to gain\neveryone's trust, then plotted to buy\nthe truly valuable raw stones at a low\nprice. Boss 2, your heart is truly dark.\nIn an instant, everyone suddenly\nrealized, clamoring as they looked\ntowards the discomposed two Dong Han, we\nwere all deceived by that guy named Too.\nBoss 2, doing this is too immoral. Lamb\nTen Ny was even more angry, gritting his\nteeth. Boss two, my lamb family will\nremember this debt. This time, Coten and\npersonally carried the tray holding the\ngemstone to Tranmack, smiling as he\nsaid, \"Mr. Tran, thank you for exposing\ntwo Dong Hans true colors. Wait until\nthe stone gambling assembly ends. I have\nprepared a small gift to express my\ngratitude. Then thank you, boss company.\nSo Van Hung sitting beside him also\nlaughed and added, \"Old co, your thank\nyou gift better not be too cheap.\" Coten\nand glared at him. Don't worry, I co am\nnot a stingy person. Tranmack took the\ngemstone from the tray, casually tossing\nit to Tran tongue too behind him. Help\nme hold it. The old man was stunned.\nhurriedly and carefully catching it,\nbowing respectfully as he responded\nloudly. As you command, everyone watched\nTran Mack casually toss a gemstone worth\nhundreds of millions, becoming even more\nshocked. That was a priceless blood\ndiamond. Yet, he just assuredly let\nsomeone else hold it for him. Emo Dong\nYi looked at Tramac, finding it even\nharder to hide her admiration, sighing\nin her heart. Tranmac is the true man.\nOver there, Yin Quinton also rubbed her\nchin. suddenly having a thought. If I\ntake that diamond and make it into a\nring, would it be very beautiful? Next,\nthe auction continued coat tin and\nshouted with a beaming face. All right,\nnext. Please welcome the sixth raw\nstone. After that, no one believed two\nDong Han's words anymore. So, Van Hung\nconsulted Tranmack many times, spending\na large price to buy a few stones. Next\nwas the 17th raw stone. Tranmack, who\nhad been sitting still since the first 5\nmillion bid, now once again was the\nfirst to bid, 500,000. That kid bid,\nlet's raise too. It might be top quality\njade. The whole hall unanimously thought\nTransMac knew there was a precious gem\ninside, clamoring eagerly to raise the\nprice. 6 million, 7 million, 10 million,\n11 million. The number kept climbing,\nand with every price increase, the smile\non old coin Anne's face became a bit\nbrighter. the corners of his mouth\nalmost splitting to his ears. Finally,\ntwo Dong Han raised his hand to bid 30\nmillion and the raw stone belonged to\nhim. But when the staff cut the stone\nopen, the whole hall sucked in a breath\nof cold air, and someone couldn't help\nbut laugh out loud. It did show green,\nbut the value absolutely did not exceed\n10 million. Tudong Han suffered a\ncrushing loss. Tudong Han looked at the\nresult before him, only able to try to\nhold it in, his shoulders trembling,\nteeth gritted tight. Only Tranmack\nunderstood the truth, resting his chin\non his hand and sighing. That is a piece\nof wood spirit jade. It's basically not\na question of whether it's worth money\nor not. Then there was no then anymore.\nThe microphone sound rang out. The stone\ngambling assembly has ended beautifully.\nThank you everyone for gracing us with\nyour presence. As soon as Coin and\nstepped down from the stone platform, he\nwalked to Tramax side, extending his\nhand with a smile. Mr. Tran, please move\nyour steps to the backstage. So, Van\nHung, turned his head to look at him,\nreacting immediately, asking in\nsurprise. Old co, you want to take Mr.\nTran to Treasure Hall's warehouse? Of\ncourse, I said I wanted to thank Mr.\nTran, following Cot Tin into the\nwarehouse. This place wasn't much\ndifferent from the main hall outside\nwith both sides piled high with raw\nstones. So, Van Hung sucked in a breath\nof cold air, staring wideeyed. Oh,\nmother, this many coat tin and stood\nbeside him, smiling as he looked at him\nand said, \"Mr. Tran to express my\ngratitude. You may freely choose three\nraw stones here. I give them for free.\nTranmack glanced at boss co with some\nsuspicion. This gift was a bit big. Not\nonly him. Even so, Van Hong was\nsurprised. Old co are you really letting\nMr. Tran choose freely? He might very\nwell choose the three most valuable\nones.\nGenerously declared, \"Mr. TR, choose\nwhatever you like. I absolutely won't\nregret it.\" Tranmack looked at him\nindifferently. The corners of his mouth\nslightly raised and asked boss co\ndirectly, \"Speak, what do you need my\nhelp with?\" A flash of surprise passed\nthrough co Tinan's eyes, but he quickly\nsmiled to hide it and continued. \"Mr.\nTran indeed guessed it. Then I won't\nbeat around the bush either. In a few\ndays, I and a few friends have a\ntransaction, and I want to invite Mr.\nTran over to give some pointers. Since\nBoss Co is so generous, I agree.\"\nHearing him accept, Coten and grinned\nfrom ear to ear, clased his hands and\nsaid, \"Thank you, Mr. Tran.\" After that,\nTranmack did not stand on ceremony, and\nwalked around the two rows of raw stone\nshelves, observing carefully. The eyes\nof the crowd behind him were glued to\nhis back with curiosity from start to\nfinish. With so many raw stones, can\nthis guy really pick out the most\nvaluable ones? Actually, I'm more\ncurious about what kind of raw stones he\nwill choose. A moment later, Tramac\nfinally took out three raw stones and\nplaced them on the empty table. Looking\nup at co tenin and said, \"Take these\nthree. Boss co, please cut them.\" The\nthree raw stones quickly revealed the\nprecious jade inside. The onlookers saw\nthe quality of the jade and were a bit\ndisappointed. Although all three raw\nstones revealed precious jade, the value\nisn't very high. Tramac misjudged this\ntime. Coat Tin and on the contrary knew\nhow to behave well and was the first\nappraise. Huh. Mr. Tran indeed has eyes\nthat recognize pearls. These three raw\nstones are not wasted. So Van Hung\nbeside him also smiled to smooth things\nover. Mr. Tran is truly kind. He showed\nmercy to old company. Tranmack remained\nindifferent and ordered old Tran. Tran\ntongue too. Take them. Let's go. The old\nman standing next to him nodded\nrespectfully. Yes. Then Tramac took the\nlead and the group followed him back to\nthe main hall. Unexpectedly, after just\na few steps, they ran into two Don Han\nleading people to block the way. His\nface darkened as he growled. You can go,\nbut leave the blood diamond behind. So\nVan Hongs face turned black as he\nshouted, \"Mad dog too, you dare to rob\nus in broad daylight? Let me tell you\nthis is Saitang, not Ruhi.\" Coten and\nbeside him also reminded in a deep\nvoice, \"Boss 2, doing this breaks the\nrules.\" He looked at them, his voice\nhissing through his teeth. It's not that\nI want to break the rules. It's really\nthat this brat doesn't know what's good\nfor him, and offended Master Wong. So,\nVan Hung raised his eyebrows in disdain.\nWho is Master Wong? Just then, a person\nwearing cloth shoes and exuding a towist\naura stepped out from the crowd. It was\nthe tall, thin old man who sat next to\ntwo Dong Han during the transaction. He\nspoke in a horse voice. inqin ang\nbesides me. Who else dares to call\nthemselves Wong? So Van Hung and Co Tin\nwere both shocked, broke out in cold\nsweat, and looked at him in disbelief.\nGhost sorrow. Wong Yong Shan. Wong Yong\nSha exuded a feeling like a walking\ncorpse. And at this moment, he\nthreatened even more coldly. Kid, hand\nover the blood diamond to me. That is\nnot something a mortal like you can\nhold. So Van Hung stood behind Tranmack\nmomentarily panicked while Cotin and had\nalready walked up to Tranmack trying\nhard to persuade him. Mr. Tran, you\nshould hand over that blood diamond.\nMaster Wong's power is not something we\ncan imagine. Tranmack glanced at him\ncalmly and chuckled. Oh, is this Master\nWong very powerful? Coten and beside him\nsincerely educated Tranmack. Master Wong\nopened a spiritual hall, can catch\nghosts and exorcise evil, communicate\nwith Ein and Yang, and even control\nwandering souls and wild ghosts to seize\nother souls. He is extremely effective.\nPeople gave him the nickname Ghost\nSorrow. Is that so? Tramac looked up,\nstudied the old man for a few seconds,\nthen sneered. How about this? If you\nwant the blood diamond, trade your life\nfor it. The old man frowned. A fierce\nlight appeared in his eyes, and he\nroared in anger. kid, since you want to\ndie, this old man will fulfill your\nwish. Saying that, he took out a sealed\nurn of ashes from his sleeve. Forcefully\ntore off the talisman on the lid, and a\nblood red ghost spirit rushed out.\nEveryone was scared, stiff, looking up\nat the ghost spirit. Wong Yong Shan\npointed at Tramac and ordered, \"Go eat\nhis soul.\" As soon as the words fell,\nthe ghost shadow opened its mouth full\nof fangs, let out an earpiercing shriek,\nand rushed towards Tranmac. Coten and\nand So Van Hong were scared out of their\nwits, turned around and ran, screaming,\n\"Ghost! There's really a ghost.\" Yan Quu\nTan also hid behind in fear. Tang Tang\nexclaimed, \"A ghost in broad daylight.\nMiss, be careful.\" Seeing the ghost's\nshadow bearing its fangs and brandishing\nits claws, Tran tongue too shouted\nthrough a punch and rushed forward to\nblock in front of Tranmack, \"I'll fight\nyou to the death.\" However, the old\nman's fist hit the ghost's shadow, but\nstrangely passed through, and the ghost\nshadow continued to rush towards\nTranmack. Tran tongue too turned his\nhead in panic and shouted, \"Young\nmaster, be careful.\" Tran still stood\ncalmly in place, suddenly grabbing at\nthe ghost shadow in midair. A petty\nghost spirit dares to act recklessly.\nBoom! A bolt of lightning shot out from\nTrax's fingertip. The moment it hit the\nghost shadow, the lightning flared up a\nhundred times, directly blasting the red\nghost shadow into a pile of black ash.\nWong Yong Shan immediately knelt on the\nground in fear, his whole body trembling\nas he begged for mercy. I didn't know\nthe celestial master had arrived. I\noffended the celestial master. Please\nspare my life, celestial master.\nTranmack looked down from above, glanced\nat him coldly, and said, \"You raise evil\nghosts. harm the human world and have\nkilled countless innocent lives. How can\nI spare you? After speaking, Tranmack\nwaved his hand again and a bolt of\nlightning identical to the previous one\nstruck Wong Yong Shan. The old man's\neyes widened, his body convulsed,\nletting out a miserable scream. And a\nfew seconds later, he fell down\npowerlessly, his soul returning to the\nwest. Hudon Han stared at Trram in\nhorror. This young man could summon\nlightning, easily, slay ghost souls, and\nkill Master Wong in one move. He\nimmediately knelt down and cowtowed to\nbeg for mercy. Master, I was threatened\nby Wong Yong Sha, please spare my life.\nCoin and so Van Hong had returned by\nnow, their faces full of worship,\nopening their mouths with a stream of\nflattery. Mr. Tran, you are the true\nmaster. Master Tran, you are truly a\ncelestial master descended to Earth.\nTranmack just gently shook his head and\nexplained simply, \"I am not a celestial\nmaster. I am just an immortal cultivator\nwho understands a bit of tauist magic.\"\nSo Van Hung and the others basically\ncouldn't distinguish between these two\nconcepts, only blindly worshiping\nTranmack. In our eyes, Master Tran is a\ntrue immortal. We hope Master Tran will\nlook after us more in the future. Yin\nQuinton was also filled with shock at\nthe scene just now, muttering to\nherself, \"How can he be so powerful? Is\nhe still human? Tang Tang also frowned\nin confusion. Could it be that the\nmartial arts technique Tramac practices\nis related to lightning? On this side,\nTranac ignored them, stood in front of\ntwo Don Han, who was kneeling on the\nground and said coldly, \"Considering\nit's your first offense, I'll spare your\nlife. Before dawn tomorrow, transfer 50\nmillion to my card. In the future,\nyou're not allowed to step into Saitang\nagain. Otherwise, I will hunt you down\nto the ends of the earth to take your\nlife.\" T Dong Han immediately looked up\nand answered tremblingly without\nthinking. I will follow all your orders.\nJust then, a rhythmic round of applause\ncame from a main door. Excellent. Truly\nexcellent. Lamb Tin, I smiled and walked\nover slowly. I didn't expect to witness\nthe Tauist thunder technique with my own\neyes today. It's truly an eye opener. I\ntold you that piece of trash to Dong Han\ncouldn't stop them. Uncle Woo. The old\nman beside him kept his head bowed as\nbefore and replied faintly, \"Young\nmaster is wise.\" So Van Hung looked\nalert, staring at him and questioning,\n\"What do you want?\" He answered with his\nmouth, but his eyes shifted infatuatedly\nto Yin Quinton. \"Don't be agitated. I\ndon't want to offend a master either. I\njust want to invite this stunning beauty\nfor a drink. I wonder if the beauty will\ngive me the honor.\" Tang Tang quickly\nblocked in front of Yin Quinton, glaring\nangrily at Lamb Tien Nai. Get lost. Lamb\nTan Nye was not angry. Instead, he\nstroked his chin and smiled roguishly.\nHey, if I can have fun with two little\nbeauties, that would be even better,\nhuh? Tramac also walked up behind Tang\nTang and said, \"Let me see how much your\nstrength has grown.\" She nodded\nslightly, immediately wrapped her fist\nin true energy, rushed forward, and\nshouted, \"If you want to touch my miss,\nyou have to get past me first.\" Lamb Tan\nNye lifted his chin arrogantly. Uncle\nWoo, don't hurt her. I know how to\ncherish flowers and jade. Young master,\nrest assured, this old man understands.\nThe old man jumped forward, neutralizing\nfive or six of Tang Tangs consecutive\npunches with just one hand. Not bad.\nStrength at internal force small\nsuccess. Tang Tang used all her\nstrength, but the old man remained calm\nand unhurried, even offering an\nevaluation. At the moment she threw the\nseventh punch, Uncle Woos eyes suddenly\nturned cold and he struck out with a\npalm, directly knocking Tang Tang,\nstaggering back. Tang Tang clutched her\nchest, glaring wearily at the old man.\nUncle Woo did not press the attack, but\nsnorted in disdain. If the young master\ndidn't cherish flowers and jade, this\npalm of mine would have taken your life.\nTranmack gently shook his head from\nbehind, walking slowly forward. It seems\nyou are still too weak. It's my strength\nthat is inferior. I have to rely on you\nnext. Lamb. Tien N's expression also\nchanged at this moment. And before\nTramac could act, he threatened, \"If you\ndare to interfere, you are making an\nenemy of my lamb family.\" Tran Mack\ncalmly retorted, \"In my eyes, your lamb\nfamily is just ants.\" Lamb Ten Nye\nglared and shouted, \"Dare to insult my\nlamb family.\" Uncle Woo him.\nUncle Woos hands form claws, rushing\nforward with sharp wind force. Kid D.\nTramax stood in place, merely gathering\nhis energy, and threw a punch through\nthe air at the old man. Killing you is\nlike slaughtering chickens and dogs. The\npunch struck out, carrying a doineering\naura of slaughter, destroying his\ninternal organs, causing his eyes to\nwiden miserably as he let out a tragic\nscream. Lamb Tien Nye screamed in\nhorror, unable to believe it. Uncle Woo\nis a martial artist at Internal Force\nGreat Success. How could he not\nwithstand even a single move? Tranmack\nhadn't retracted his fist yet and\nglanced coldly at him. Your turn.\nLambian Ny's whole body went cold. He\nhurly retreated, his threatening words\nfilled with trembling. What do you want\nto do? If you dare to touch me, the Lamb\nfamily will absolutely not spare you.\nTranmack narrowed his eyes, his words\nspoken like a sentence. Today, I will\nyour legs. as punishment. Lamb\nTan Ny's eyes widened and with a thud he\nknelt on the ground begging for mercy.\nBig brother, I was wrong. I have eyes\nbut failed to see Mount Thai. Please\nspare me. My lamb family will definitely\nrepay you generously. Tranmack had\nalready walked up to him, glanced at him\nindifferently and said, \"Too late.\"\nHaving said that, Tran Mack lifted his\nfoot and crushed lamb tien ny bones. He\nstared wideeyed in pain, letting out a\nscream that shook the heavens and earth.\nAh! His whole body trembled, unable to\nsupport himself, and he fell backward\nonto the ground, gritting his teeth in\npain, his face ashen, he said\nresentfully, \"My lamb family won't let\nyou off.\" This scene also caused, \"So\nVan Hung's group to gulp. Cold sweat\nstreaming down, \"This person cannot be\nprovoked. We absolutely must appease\nhim. Appease him.\" Night fell. After\nrushing about all day, he finally\nreturned home. Tramac opened the room\ndoor, breathing a sigh of relief. I've\narranged accommodation for Tran Tong 2,\nYin Quinton, and Tang Tang. Finally, I\ncan have a moment of peace. Then he\nwalked into the room, went to the large\ndesk, looked at today's harvest from\nCotenan, and rested his chin on his hand\nwith satisfaction. With these precious\njades, I can step into the second stage\nof chi refining. At the same time on\nanother floor, Yin Quinton was half\nlying, half sitting playing with her\nphone, pondering what excuse to use to\ntrick him out of that blood diamond. If\nmade into a ring to wear, it would\ndefinitely be very beautiful. The\nhigh-hanging full moon was partially\nobscured by dark clouds. In the room,\nTran Mack, who was meditating, suddenly\nopened his eyes. Brilliant golden lights\nhovered around him. Chi refining second\nstage achieved. The current cultivation\nresources are too poor. I have to give\nup the nine turns golden body from my\npast life and cultivate the primordial\nindestructible body of the primordial\nsect first, temporarily using it as a\nbody refining technique. Thus, he closed\nhis eyes again and immersed himself in\ncultivation. It wasn't until noon the\nnext day after eating and drinking his\nfill that he went downstairs. Just as he\nsat at the table, he was a bit flustered\naccepting the food Yin Quinton picked\nfor him. Here, eat this. Taste this\ndish. Don't be polite. Tang Tang made it\nall. Be careful. It's hot. Tran Tong Tu\njust focused on burying his head in his\nrice while Tang Tang didn't dare look at\nthis scene at all. It was too\nembarrassing. A moment later, Yin\nQuinton looked at Tranmack, revealing a\nflirtatious smile. \"Brother Tranmack,\nthat blood diamond of yours, can you\nlend it to me to look at?\" He held a\nbowl in one hand and chopsticks in the\nother, showing no reaction, and just\nreplied faintly. At this time at the\nnumber one aristocratic family in Lamb\nChow, the Lamb Family, Lamb Tai with\nboth legs and casts, sat in the living\nroom screaming resentfully, \"Dad, Uncle\nWoo is dead and my legs are broken. I\nmust make that bastard wish he were\ndead.\" Sitting in the main seat was\nnaturally the Lamb family head, Lamb\nChuan. His face was dark and he said\nnothing. Below, other members of the\nLamb family also revealed angry\nexpressions. Family head. If this grudge\nisn't avenged, what face will our Lamb\nfamily have left? That's right, family\nhead. We must exterminate his whole\nfamily. Lambuan's eyes were full of\ncruelty. And he ordered in a deep voice,\n\"Lamb new Fong, take some people to deal\nwith so Van Hong. From now on, I want\nthe underworld of Saitang to bear the\nsurname Lamb.\" A young man immediately\nstepped forward, bowing respectfully to\naccept the order. Yes. 3 days later, six\npeople sat around a round table. The\nperson sitting in the main seat was so\nvan hung, looking mournful as he sighed.\nThese past few days, the Lamb family has\nbeen frantically attacking my territory.\nTonight, they even sent an internal\nrealm expert to kill me. Sitting next to\nTramac was the se leader of Nam Hong\nMan, Chong Vihoa. He looked at So Van\nHung and said, \"Bosso, you shouldn't\nhave invited a wet behind the ears brat\nto be a helper.\" So Van Hung looked\nawkward, hurriedly smiling\napologetically. Master Chung, don't look\nat Master Trans youth. He possesses\nlightning techniques. His strength is\nunfathomable. Huh? Chung Behoa continued\nto mock loudly. What lightning\ntechnique? It's all just trickery. Tran\nMack couldn't be bothered to pay\nattention to him, but Tran Tongu beside\nhim was furious. Yin, Quint, Ton, and\nTang Tang also threw him a contemptuous\nlook. They all understood that Chungve\nHoa wanted to use belittling Tranmac to\nhighlight his own extraordinariness.\nThey were waiting to see what expression\nthat Chong Vehoa would have after\nTranmack showed his strength. Just then,\nthe clock on the wall pointed to 9 in\nthe evening. The large door outside was\nsuddenly pushed open forcefully. Lamb\nknew Fong stood there with his hands\nclasped, casually scanning everyone at\nthe table and sneered. So, Van Hung, you\nfound a helper? It seems you intend to\nrefuse my conditions. So Van Hung was a\nbit tense and shouted angrily, \"Lambu\nFong, don't push people too far. I've\nalready seated onethird of the\nterritory,\"\nsaying coldly. So Van Hung, the one who\nbroke young Master Lamb's legs as your\nguest, if I don't look for you, who\nshould I look for? So Van Hung\nimmediately glanced at Tranmax sitting\nbehind him, only able to grit his teeth\nin silent resentment, always causing\ntrouble for me. At this moment, Chungv\nHoa left his seat, stood in front of So\nVan Hung, and spoke impatiently, \"Let me\ntest how much you weigh.\" Lamb Newfong\nlooked at him as scants, asking\ndisdainfully, \"Internal Realm expert,\nare you sure you want to be an enemy of\nmy lamb family? Is the lamb family\nworthy of being my enemy?\" \"Very well,\nthen I'll deal with you first, then take\nso Van Hung's dog life,\"\ndelivering a flying kick. Chung Vihoa\ndid not show weakness either, jumping up\nto grab his ankle with one hand while\nthrusting his knee up. Tran Tong Tu\nstood aside watching and asked the young\nmaster curiously, \"These two are evenly\nmatched. Who do you say will win? What\ndo you think?\" The old man thought for a\nmoment and replied, \"Chung vihoa.\" Tran\nMack crossed his arms, saying faintly,\n\"Wrong. Chung Vehoa has just entered the\ninternal realm. His foundation isn't\nstable. Plus, his temperament is too\narrogant and conceited. Within 10 moves,\nhe will definitely be defeated. Just as\nTramac finished speaking over there,\nChung Viho was punched back by Lamb\nNewong. His eyes widened and he spat out\na large mouthful of blood and pain.\nLuong\nhaha, thanks for letting me win. Chung\nVi Hoa's face was pale, clutching his\nchest. He said weakly to so Van Hung\nboss. So, it is because my talent and\nstrength are meager. So, Van Hung's face\nimmediately turned ashen, panicked and\nflustered. Huh? Even Chung Vho lost.\nJust then, Tran Mack, who had been\nsitting quietly on the side, calmly\nstood up and spoke. Actually, I'm the\none who broke Lamb Tai's legs. Lamb knew\nFong frowned and questioned, \"How is\nthat possible? You are basically not an\ninternal realm martial artist.\" Tramac\nraised his eyebrows in disdain, asking\nback, \"Are internal realm martial\nartists very rare?\" Lamb New Fong looked\nstraight at Tranmack, also sneering\ncontemptuously. If not, then what? Do\nyou think internal real martial artists\nare cabbages found all over the streets?\nChung Vhoa, though weak, still try to\nwalk to Tranmax's side to remind him. I\nwas 40 before I cultivated to become an\ninternal real martial artist. Kid, don't\nbe too arrogant. Tramac ignored them.\nTook a small bottle from his pocket,\npoured out a crystal clearar pill, and\nheld it in front of Tran Tong too,\nordering, \"Swallow it.\" As soon as Yin,\nQuinn, Ton, and Tang Tang saw it. They\nrecognized it in astonishment, wondering\nin their hearts. Could it be the Payuan\npill? Tranungu was stunned, but quickly\nnodded. Yes. The old man took the pill\nand swallowed it without hesitation,\nthen immediately entered a state of\ncultivation. A layer of dense trueqi\nappeared around him. So, Van Hung also\nstared in surprise. What's going on?\nTaking medicine without being injured,\nChung Viho curled his lips in disdain,\nsnorting, playing mysterious tricks.\nOnly Lamb knew Fong had a thoughtful\nlook in his eyes, looking at the old man\nuncertainly. Could it be he? He\nimpossible. That's too absurd. Very\nquickly, just a moment later, killing\nintent flashed in Tran Tongu's eyes. He\nopened them forcefully, knelt down, and\ncowtowed to Tramac. Master's great\nkindness. This disciple doesn't know how\nto repay. Tranmack replied faintly, \"Go,\ndon't embarrass me.\" Not that stood up\nwith an imposing aura, shouting loudly.\nThose who humiliate my benefactor must\nbe killed. Lamb knew Fong stepped back\nin horror. Internal realm great success.\nHow is that possible? Chung Yihoa was\nalso full of horror, exclaiming in\ndisbelief, \"Fake? It must be fake. This\nis just some kind of secret technique.\"\nFigning the realm. Tran tongue too\ndidn't say another word. The power in\nhis body felt like it was about to\nexplode and he was in dire need of a\nsandbag. So he rushed straight over Dy.\nLamb knew Fong's face turned green and\nhe hurly used his arm to block. The old\nman's windbreaking fist smashed down\ndecisively directly penetrating the\ndefense and breaking his armbbone. Lamb\nNewfon's body was helplessly knocked\nflying. Chung Vhoa was dumbfounded his\nmind full of confusion. It turned out to\nbe real. Truly internal realm great\nsuccess. I don't believe it. I don't\nbelieve it. Lamb Newf Fong's face was\nfull of terror. Without saying a word,\nhe turned and ran. The old man's figure\nflashed, catching up behind him in an\ninstant, shouting, \"Want to run? Don't\neven dream of it.\" He threw a punch.\nThis time, Lamb knew Fong couldn't block\nit. The sound of shattering bones rang\nout from his body, and his face went\npale as he spat blood. Luong was dead.\nTran tongue too wearing a dowist robe\nslowly lowered his hand and said, \"I\nsaid it already. Those who humiliate my\nbenefactor must be killed.\" Seeing Lamb\nNewfong's corpse. Chung Viho was so\nscared that he immediately knelt before\nTranmack and cowed out. \"Grandmaster, I\nhad eyes but failed to see Mount Thai.\nPlease spare my life.\" He wasn't stupid.\nTrembling inside, he understood clearly\nthat being able to create an internal\nrealm expert in moments. This method was\ntruly too terrifying. Then how strong\nwas this person himself? Tranmack\nignored Chung Vhoa and just glanced\nindifferently at So Van Hung. If the\nLamb family comes to provoke you again\nlater, tell them to come directly to me.\nSo Van Hung was stunned for a moment\nbefore replying, \"Yes.\" Tran Mack\nwithdrew his gaze, turned, and walked\ndecisively toward the main door. \"Let's\ngo.\" So Van Hung hurriedly chased after\nhim, saying, \"Master Tran, I'll call a\ndriver to take you back.\" beside them.\nTang Tang looked at her young miss who\nwas still dazed and reminded her, \"Miss,\nwe should go back too.\" Tranm didn't pay\nany mind, walking side by side with Tran\nTongue Too, saying leisurely, \"I will\nteach you a set of fist techniques.\nLearn it by heart quickly as you\ncommand.\" 2 days later, reception room\nat Treasure Hall headquarters. Coten and\npersonally came out to welcome them,\nsmiling. Master Tran, please come\ninside. This time, Trax still brought a\ngroup of people with him. He walked into\nthe main hall and saw two people had\nalready arrived. Cotin and smiled and\nintroduced, \"Let me introduce you. This\nis old gentleman titam from Nam Lang\nPrefecture.\" In Nam Lang Prefecture, Mr.\nTit's word is law. Tramac gave a faint\nsmile and nodded slightly, considering\nit a greeting. Coten was long used a\nTramax attitude, but right now he was\nextremely embarrassed, smiling\napologetically and whispering to old Mr.\nTe. Master TR doesn't like formalities.\nI hope you can forgive him. Old Tat\nsmiled kindly. It's a small matter.\nAfterward, the important figures of the\nday also appeared one after another.\nBoss Fuang, Boss Co. Boss Tan, pardon\nthe intrusion. I couldn't welcome you\nfrom afar. The last person to arrive was\nto Dong Han. He cupuffed his hands,\nwalking in cheerfully. Haha, everyone\nhas been waiting long. I too apologize\nin advance. Cotin and immediately\nfrowned, speaking bluntly without saving\nface. Did boss 2 arrive late on purpose\nwanting to give us a show of strength?\nTon Han was about to refute when his\ngaze accidentally landed on Tran Mack\nsitting in the corner. His expression\nimmediately changed his body stiffening\nthinking, \"Why is he here too? I haven't\ntransferred that money to him yet.\" But\nwith this expert's help, I don't need to\nfear that brat tra anymore. Then he also\nignored Tramax's existence, raised his\nchin, and ordered smuggly, \"Bring the\nitems out. Let the big shots have a\nlook. Subordinates placed items in a\nwooden box onto the table, leaving\neveryone in the room staring blankly.\nThis is We don't understand it at all.\nBoss two, introduce them a bit. The\nitems on the table were a blue gem the\nsize of a chicken egg, followed by a\nstatue of Kitagar Bodhisva, and finally\na piece of jade in the shape of an eight\ntriagrams diagram. Tudong Han raised his\nchin and laughed. Why don't you\ngentlemen appraise them first? Elder T\nwas the first to speak up, looking up to\norder the subordinate beside him, invite\nMr. Duk Long to appraise. Hearing this\nname, Cotinan immediately asked in\nsurprise. Could this be the Duke Longren\nof yet Duong Tauist Temple to Lin Bao?\nThe man smiled smugly. It is I. Tranmax\nstill sat in the corner, his expression\ncold. Only a spark of curiosity arose\nwhen his gaze rested on that Duke\nLongren. On this Duke Longren, there's a\nfaint trace of spiritual energy. So,\ncultivators truly exist on Earth just\nfor some unknown reason. The orthodoxy\nhas been lost, leaving only a few\nscattered inheritances. Duke Long slowly\nwalked to the table, shouted softly at\nthe gem, and waved his finger. The gem\nimmediately emitted a faint stream of\ntrueqi surrounding it. He looked up in\npraise. This pearl must be a relic of\nsome attained master infused with\nspiritual energy. It has the effect of\nrefreshing the mind and improving sleep.\nHearing this, everyone around\nimmediately started discussing. Indeed,\nthe cold air radiating from this gem\nmakes me feel wide awake. I feel\nrefreshed. I want this pearl. Doug Long\nthen walked to the Buddha Sutvvis\nstatue, waved his hand, and shouted\nsoftly, \"Open.\" A faint halo immediately\nappeared around the Buddha statue,\ncausing him to exclaim with wide eyes,\ninvoluntarily taking a step back, his\nface full of horror, \"Oh my, this is\nactually a citagus\nstatue that has been consecrated by an\nattained high monk. Having this bronze\nstatue in the house can protect the\nhome's peace, keeping all evils away.\"\nThis sentence immediately made everyone\nredeyed, fighting over it. I want this,\ntoo. a treasure to guard the house. I'm\nmost afraid of ghosts. I must get this\ntreasure. Finally, it was the third\nitem. Mr. Duk Long, just like the\nprevious two times, waved his hand and\nshouted, \"Open!\" under everyone's\nexpectant gaze. That eight trigrams jade\npiece remained motionless from beginning\nto end. Duk Long opened his mouth\nexpressionlessly. \"Forgive my poor\neyesight. I cannot see what is special\nabout this eight trigrams jade piece.\"\nTong Han sneered. What a pity among the\nthree treasures I brought. This jade\npiece is the most precious. Saying so,\nhe turned around, cuped his hands to a\nfat old man behind him, and said\nrespectfully, \"Please, Master Bin.\"\nElder Bin stroked his beard cheerfully\nand laughed. \"If your cultivation is\nstill shallow, then don't embarrass\nyourself in front of others.\" This\nsentence directly poked at Duk Long's\nself-esteem. He turned red with anger\nand retorted. I have never heard of any\ntitle like master bin. That is due to\nyour lack of knowledge. Watch closely.\nThe old man finished speaking and walked\nto the eight trigrams diagram. Wave his\nfinger and tap the surface of a jade.\nThis time the jade finally reacted. A\ncircle of red runes appeared around it,\nemitting trueqi and faint mist. Everyone\nonly needed to smell that mist to become\nintoxicated by it. Uh uh. So\ncomfortable. like returning to mother's\nembrace in childhood. Duke long felt\nashamed of his inferiority,\nembarrassedly cupped his hands and\nbowed. So your excellency is a dowoist\nexpert. I have displayed my slight skill\nbefore an expert. Please forgive me,\nsenior elder been snorted disdainfully.\nGo back and cultivate for another 30\nyears. This is a magical artifact\ncapable of nourishing the body and\nprolonging life. As soon as the sentence\nwas uttered, the whole room seemed to\nexplode. Everyone rushing up to\nquestion. Prolonging life. This jade\nreally has the effect of nourishing the\nbody. Treasure. This is the real\ntreasure. Elder Bin returned to his\nseat, exchanged a knowing look with two\nDong Han and sneered smugly. Coten and\nstepped forward suspiciously and asked,\n\"Boss 2, are you willing to sell such a\nprecious treasure? That is because I\nhave obtained an even better treasure.\nSo, I am willing to sell these three\nitems.\" Well, does Bosco have any other\nopinions? Copen glanced at him, then\nturned his head and smiled at Tranmack.\nThen I'll have to trouble Grandmaster TR\nto help me appraise them a bit. At this\nmoment, the whole room of people was\nbuzzing, asking suspiciously, \"Is Bosco\nmistaken? Isn't this a high school\nstudent?\" Letting a brat come to\nappraise. Boss Co, don't joke. Facing\nthese doubts, Cotin and could only smile\nto reassure them. Everyone calm down a\nbit. Let's hear Grandmaster Trans\nopinion. In reality, he wasn't sure\neither. uncertain if Tran Mack could\nactually do it. Master Bin sneered and\nspoke. Then please, Grandmaster Tran,\ntake a look. Standing beside him, Tong\nHan also raised his chin, speaking in a\nscornful tone. Grandmaster Tran, don't\nlook incorrectly. Transmac stepped\nforward, took the eight trigrams jade in\nhis hand, glanced at it coldly, then\nlooked at Tud Dong Han and asked, \"Do\nyou really want me to speak?\" Catching\nhis gaze, Tudong Han couldn't help but\nfeel guilty and stammered. This master\nbin beside him sneered, \"Speak.\"\nTranmack put the jade down, waved his\nhand lightly, and said in an affirmative\ntone, \"These three items are all fakes.\"\nThis sentence once again caused an\nuproar in the room. \"What is he serious?\nIs he talking nonsense?\" We have all\npersonally experienced the effects of\nthese treasures. Tran Mack did not\nargue. That gentle wave of his hand just\nnow had used his own trueqi to shatter\nthe fake spiritual power surrounding\nthese three items. This ordinary pearl\nhas been infused with a trace of en\nenergy which gives people the illusion\nof being refreshed. But if in contact\nfor a long time, one will be entangled\nby in energy. That bodhisattva statue is\nthe same. Not only can it not ward off\nevil, but on the contrary, it summons\nsouls and attracts ghosts. This eight\ntrigrams jade pendant contains a simple\nformation capable of stimulating the\nwater element force hidden inside.\nElemental force of funue attributes can\nindeed nourish the body. But the user\nneeds to use their own spiritual power\nto activate the formation. Ordinary\npeople absolutely cannot use it. Tong\nHan and Master Bin's faces turn pale\nwatching the scene of themselves being\nsurrounded and criticized by everyone.\nSo they are hateful scammers daring to\nuse fakes to deceive. Dudonan, you\npeople are too shameless. At this\nmoment, Tramac looked at Masterbin\nopposite him and questioned. You are a\nfellow disciple of that master Vong,\naren't you? The old man also turned\nhostile at this moment, gritting his\nteeth and glaring. Brat, you killed my\njunior brother first, then ruined my\ngood deed. I will definitely skin you\nand pull out your tendons, turning your\nbones to ash. The old man threw his head\nback and opened his mouth wide. inhaling\na belly full of air, then spewed out a\nstream of black energy, howling as it\nrushed towards Tranmack. In midair,\nblack smoke wrapped around a ferocious\nskull, scaring everyone in the room into\nchaos. Ghost, we've met a ghost. Save\nme. The old man bared his monstrous\nmouth full of sharp teeth and laughed\nmadly. Today, I will let you taste the\nflavor of being devoured by the souls I\nraise. Six ghost soullock. As soon as he\nfinished speaking, six blood red skulls\nhowled and rushed towards Trram. Tranmac\nstood still, his expression calm as he\nraised his hand. Despite your thousand\nsouls and 10,000 ghosts, I will use a\nsingle bolt of lightning to shatter\nthem. Thunder K. Having said that, true\ncheese surged around his body, causing\nthe old man's face to fill with horror.\nHeavenly thunder dowist magic, you are a\ndescendant of the heavenly master sect.\nTranmack gently waved his hand,\n\"Exinguish!\" A bolt of lightning several\nfeet long thundered towards the old man.\nThe old man hurriedly defended, opening\nhis mouth to release souls and placing\nsix skulls in front of him to block, but\nit was all in vain. Tranmax lightning\nswept across, incinerating them all.\n\"Grandmaster, spare me. You harmed\ncountless living beings for your\ncultivation. Even if heaven spares you,\nI will not,\" Tranmax said coldly. The\nhand he had waved suddenly clenching\ntight accompanied by a miserable scream\nthat resounded to the clouds. Ah! Calf\nof Omen died. Witnessing this scene,\neveryone broke out in cold sweat, unable\nto believe their eyes. Grandmaster Tran\nhas matchless divine might, destroying\nevil spirits with just a snap of his\nfingers. Tranmax momentum did not\ndiminish. He stood there glancing at two\nDong Han. Boss 2, the money you promised\nme. Have you forgotten? He was\nimmediately scared into trembling all\nover, his face pale green, hurriedly\nreplying, \"How would I dare forget\nGrandmaster TR's instructions?\" \"I will\nimmediately go back and prepare it for\nGrandmaster TR.\" I seem to have said,\n\"If the money doesn't arrive, your life\nwon't remain either.\" Tong Han knelt\ndown and cowtowed, begging, \"Grandmaster\nTran, I had the money ready. It was Cow\nVo who threatened me not to bring it. I\nbeg you to give me another chance. I\nwill bring it immediately. Double\nTranmax's face was gloomy. He ordered\ncoldly. Too late. Tongue Tuesday. Tran\ntongue too immediately clenched his fist\nand rushed forward. Tudong Han took a\nheavy punch. Blood spraying from his\nnose and mouth, flying outwards. Tudonan\ndive. The subordinates simultaneously\ncupped their hands and bowed, shouting\nwith horrified faces. Grandmaster Tran\nhas matchless divine might. We are fully\nconvinced. Yin Quinn Ton watched\nintently, secretly wishing in her heart,\n\"If I also had such strength, who would\ndare interfere with my destiny?\" Trax's\nface remained icy. He glanced once and\ninstructed, \"Go get that eight trigrams\njade pendant. I need to use it.\" Tran\ntongue too nodded, looking very\nreluctant, but still obediently did so.\nYes. Finally obtaining the item, he felt\nextremely satisfied. With this water\nattribute jade pendant, I can set up the\nfive elements spirit gathering array.\nThen Tran Mack turned to those\nsubordinates, speaking indifferently.\nWho wants to take over two Dong Hans\nforces? I want half of the assets. Of\ncourse, I won't take it for free. Coten\nand rub his hands together, looking\ngreedy. Grandmaster Tran, you're the\nhonored guest I invited. This naturally\nshould be left to me. He calculated in\nhis heart. In the future, if there's\nanything I can't resolve, I can invite\nTranmack to show his face. Tramac also\nagreed. Bennis decided being given\npermission. Cotin and immediately beamed\nwith joy. Made a big profit this time.\nRight at this moment, another big shot\nsuddenly knelled down, clasping his\nhands in a respectful plea. Grandmaster\nTran, I'm willing to submit to you.\nPlease look after me. So Van Hung truly\ndared not believe his eyes, his mouth\nagape in shock. Then he and the others\nalso knelt down without hesitation.\nPlease look after us, Grandmaster Tran.\nI am willing to submit. Tranmack put his\nhands in his pockets, arrogantly\naccepting. Good, but if anyone is\ncompliant in appearance, but\noppositional in heart, don't blame me\nfor being ruthless. Everyone immediately\nshivered, shouting in unison. We\nwouldn't dare. Bosan was a bit\nterrified. Grandmaster TR is too fierce.\nBoss Fang also secretly sighed. From\ntoday onwards, half of this territory,\nI'm afraid, will be ruled by Grandmaster\nTran. Titam watched in a daysaze. This\nis a true grandmaster. Though living in\na mortal world, he is not a mundane\nperson. A few days later, an urgent\nvoice shouted loudly. Bad news. Bad\nnews. Grandmaster TR. So Van Hung\ncouldn't help but yell over the phone.\nThe Lamb family has sent a challenge\nletter. They want to challenge you,\nGrandmaster Tran. 3 days from now at Yin\nQui Lake. Coten and snatched the phone\nfrom the side. His face pale as he\ncontinued, \"Grandmaster Tran, they\nkilled Tim Hoa, saying that if we don't\nsubmit to the Lamb family by then, our\nend will be the same as his. You must\nuphold justice for us.\" Tranmack frowned\non the other end of the line, but\nremained calm. \"I know.\" However, if\nanyone saw Tranmax's expression at this\nmoment, they would definitely find it\nextremely terrifying. 3 days later, I\nTramac will definitely be there on time.\nFinally, the appointed time arrived.\nEveryone gathered by Yinqi Lake. Boss\nTan asked suspiciously, \"Why hasn't\nGrandmaster Tran arrived yet?\" The\nothers also looked confused. \"It's time,\nisn't it?\" Co Tin and anxiously kept\ncalling Tramac. I can't get through to\nGrandmaster TR. So, Van Hung hurriedly\nreassured. Don't rush. The Lamb family\npeople haven't arrived either. Just\nthen, a convoy of luxury cars appeared,\nstopping one after another. People\nquickly stepped out of the cars, daring\nnot to waste a single second. They\nneatly divided into two rows with strict\ndiscipline. Suddenly, the sound of water\nbeing treaded upon rushed over from the\nwater surface, accompanied by a burst of\nhearty laughter. The bodyguards\nimmediately shouted respectfully,\n\"Welcome, third elder.\" He walked over\nfrom the lake surface, every step\ncarrying power, his appearance extremely\nmagnificent. The calm lake surface was\nsplashed with jets of water. The third\nelder finally reached the lakeside. He\nlooked around but did not see Tranmack.\nWhere is Tramac? Could it be he was\nscared away by the prestige of my lamb\nfamily? His arrogant tone made the\ncowardly co tin and shrink back in fear.\nIt's Grandmaster TR. Just as he was\npanicking, someone shouted, \"Grandmaster\nTR is here. Grandmaster TR has arrived.\"\nSo Van hung and everyone else breathed a\nsigh of relief. Thank heavens.\nGrandmaster Tran has finally come. The\nthird elder smirked, mocking. Brat,\nkneel down and cowtow to beg for mercy\nnow and I might spare your life.\nTramax's tongue was sharp as well,\nimmediately retorting. Are people from\nthe lamb family all this stupid? The\nthird elder spoke, \"No more nonsense.\"\nHe assumed his stance, clenching his\nfist to signal. Only the winner has the\nright to speak. Make your move. But\nbefore Tranmack could step forward,\nTongue Tu snorted coldly and rushed out\nfirst. If you want to challenge the\nyoung master, you must first pass me,\nthe third elder said contemptuously.\nSeeking death, I'll grant your wish.\nTongue two was provoked, unable to hold\nback a curse. Arrogant, the two\nimmediately rushed at each other, one\nattacking, one defending, they instantly\nengaged in a contest. The sound of fists\ncolliding thumped incessantly. Everyone\nwatched the speed of their moves, unable\nto help but stare with mouth agape.\nShock was written all over the faces of\nso van hung and cotenin on this side\nafter about continuous exchange. The two\nalso retreated widening the distance.\nThe third elder was so tired he was\npanting like a buffalo. Your strength is\nextraordinary. If you join my lamb\nfamily I guarantee you a boundless\nfuture. Otherwise I will surely kill you\ntoday. Looking back at tongue too. He\nseemed to have expended little effort\nonly sweating slightly. Did you forget\nyour brain when you went out saying such\nthings? The third elder was angered by\ntongue two's disdain. H ungrateful\nwretch. So he reached out to take a\nsword from a subordinate while speaking\nindifferently. My lamb family is most\nfamous not for martial arts but for\nswordsmanship. The third elder of the\ndragon gate raised his weapon, his\nintent to challenge extremely clear. Use\nyour life to regret this. It seemed he\nwasn't joking. Swinging his arm, the\nsword tip pointed forward, flying\ntowards the opponent with terrifying\npower. Dragon gate three overlapping\nwaves. Tongue two did not dodge. One\nhand placed on the elbow of a raised\nfist. A stream of energy immediately\nradiating out. Heaven Mystic three fists\nmountain splitter. The two rushed out\nsimultaneously, their power quickly\ncolliding, creating a violent reaction.\nThe onlookers were unfortunately\naffected. The light and pressure forced\nthem to try and keep their balance after\nthe shock wave. After the tremor, the\nthird elder's sword fell to the ground\nwith a clang. His whole body trembled.\nHis face filled with horror. What fist\ntechnique is that? How can it be so\npowerful? Hearing this tongue too didn't\nmind telling him a truth. This fist\ntechnique of mine is far inferior to the\nyoung masters. It's just that you are\ntoo weak. The third elers's eyes\nwidened, hesitating inside. Could it be\nhe is not an ordinary person? He\nobserved Tramac, secretly speculating in\nhorror. Or perhaps his cultivation is so\nhigh that my realm cannot detect it. At\nthis moment, only one word appeared in\nhis mind. Run. Tranmack looked at his\nback, asking gently, \"Did I say you\ncould leave?\" This coward's face turned\npale, but he remained confident. My lamb\nkeemfongs light in his skill is\npeerless. Even if you were a\ntransformation realm grandmaster, you\ncannot catch up to me. Tranmack behind\nhim said no more. He snapped his\nfingers, condensing a small ball of\nlight which turned into a sharp blade\nwhen fired, tearing through the wind\nwith terrifying speed. The third elers's\nhead was pierced in an instant. He still\ncouldn't accept it. His final thought\nremaining only a denial of reality. No,\nimpossible. The third elers's body\nimmediately fell into the lake.\nEverything ended too quickly. Yin\nQuinton and Tang Tang were both\nextremely surprised. Tran Mack could\nactually. Those bodyguards could only\nwatch helplessly, too scared to move.\nNext, everyone hurriedly knelt down in\nsubmission. Grandmaster Tran has divine\nmight, invincible under the heavens. We\nbow in admiration. He squinted at them,\nhis tone as emotionless as before. At\nthis time, at the Lamb family home in\nLamb Chow, the news had also arrived.\nFamily head Keef Fong has been killed.\nHe shouted loudly, \"What?\" The lamb\nfamily head lambwan shook all over. It\nseems now is the time to invite that\nperson down from the mountain. A\nsubordinate suddenly reported in panic.\nFamily head, someone outside sent a\nmessage wanting you too. Seeing the\nperson stuttering, he lost patience and\nsaid, \"Speak.\" The subordinate's face\nturned red, hesitating for a long while\nbefore daring to speak directly, that\nperson said, \"Telling you to go out and\ndie.\" Lanchuan was not angry, but\nshocked. Did that person say what his\nname is? How old? How many people did he\nbring? He immediately described. He\nlooks like a student, calls himself\nTranmack, and he is alone. Lamb Chuan\nwas even more horrified. At this moment,\noutside the Lamb family door was a scene\nof chaos. Tranmack stepped on a person\nwho was screaming loudly in misery. Let\nme go. You're dead meat. Let me go\nimmediately. Lamb twe stepped forward,\nlooking at Tranmack with a sneer.\nGrandmaster TR, your skills are indeed\nnot bad. Are you wanting to negotiate\nconditions with my lamb family now?\nTranmack coldly denied. Negotiate\nconditions? No. Tranmax stomped down\nhard. The person under his foot spurting\na mouthful of blood. At the same time,\nTramac declared, \"I came to wipe out the\nclan.\" Trax's tone was unusually calm,\nlike taking a stroll in a quiet\ncourtyard. Lampe just consider it wild\ntalk. Nonsense. No matter how great your\nskills are, you can't touch a single\nperson in my Lamb family. As soon as he\nfinished speaking, Trax said in a deep\nvoice, \"Spiritual energy transforms into\na sword.\" The person blocking in front\nof him was immediately slashed across\nthe waist. One sword slash slays the\nliving. Lamb Chuan inside was restless,\nso he ordered, \"Why is there no more\nmovement?\" \"Lambuet, go out and check.\"\nShe nodded, replying, \"Yes,\" who\nexpected that Tran Mack had already\nslowly walked in, speaking up to stop\nher. \"No need.\" He was shocked. How did\nyou get in here? Where is Lamb Twe?\nTranmack seemed to intentionally\nprovoke. Asking back, \"What do you\nthink?\" Lamb Chuan was so angry his face\nturned green. Threats hissing through\nhis teeth. Tranmack, you dare to show\noff your power here today? You won't\nleave this place. But Tranmack remained\ncontemptuous. Pity, the dead have no\nright to speak. He couldn't contain his\nanger, forming seals with both hands,\nsummoning his crimson sword. You can't\nescape. Lambwan gripped the sword in his\nhand tightly then pointed the sword tip\nout shouting flowing cloud 13 swords. He\nsplit into several after images\nsurrounding Tranmack in the center of\ncircle. Tramax stood on the spot not\nmoving an inch. Tramac opened his mouth\nto insult like child sword play. It\nmight be passible for directing martial\narts and TV dramas. Suddenly he used\njust two fingers to clamp the sword\nblade tight. Enough. Show's over. Your\nturn. The other hand quickly raised up.\nMountain breaker. The lamb family head\nwas immediately knocked flying by a\nterrifying force. Subordinates hurriedly\nshouted. Family head. Everyone whispered\nin discussion. What martial art is this?\nSuch terrifying power. Trax still stood\nfirmly on the spot, never having moved\nhalf a step. His tone carried a hint of\npraise, taking a punch of mine without\ndying. You were slightly stronger than\nthat Lamb Keem Fong. Lamb Chuan's face\nwas flushed red. slightly purple. He\nclutched his chest, gritting his teeth\nagainst the pain, and said, \"Kid, let's\nend today's matter here. In the future,\nyou and I will not interfere with each\nother's business.\" \"How about it?\"\nTramac naturally did not agree,\nemphasizing every word. \"Oh, have you\nnot understood yet? I came to wipe out\nthe clan.\" Lamb Chuan slumped to the\nground, hurriedly begging, \"Grandmaster\nTran, why must you be so aggressive,\ndriving us to extinction like this?\" He\nsaid, \"No more.\" suddenly shouting a\nname. Lamb Tuet, that female subordinate\nof his suddenly bowed her head,\nanswering respectfully, \"Master Lamban\nonly now reacted in shock, questioning\nher.\" Lamb Tuet, the Lamb family treated\nyou not badly. Why did you betray us? If\nnot mentioned, it was fine. But\nmentioning this matter, Lamb Tuet was\nfurious as if fire burned in her heart.\nShe clenched her hands into fists,\ntrying her best to suppress the urge to\nkill. Lambuan, back then you forced my\nbirth mother to death and kill my birth\nfather. Raising me now, isn't it just to\ncontinue using me? This is called\ntreating me not badly. Her eyes were\nbloodshot, not hiding her true face at\nall. I really want to make your lamb\nfamily's line and forever doomed beyond\nredemption. Tranmack looked at Lamb\nChuan, exposing his crimes. Lambu had\nalready said it. You are investigating\nand planning to harm my family. This is\nmy bottom line. No one is allowed to\ntouch it. Do you have any last words?\nLambuan's face darkened, suddenly\nspeaking sinisterly. Tranmack, today you\nsevered my path of martial arts, he said\nhalfway, suddenly finding strength from\nsomewhere to stand up, bursting with\nimmense energy. Tomorrow I will make\nyour family ruined and dead. The\nsubordinates in the clan laughed\nexcitedly. External release of trueqi\ntreading on air. This is the grandmaster\nrealm. This time the patriarch can\ndefinitely kill Tranmack. His eyes\nglowed, seemingly burning with rage,\ngritting his teeth. The price of\ninstantly transforming the realm is\nexhausting my cultivation foundation.\nBut to kill you, it's worth it. Tramac\nfelt it was ridiculous, mocking. Can you\ndo it? I'll give you a chance to try.\nLamuan lost all patience, holding a long\nsword, launching an attack again. Take\nmy sword, he swung his sword,\nsimultaneously rushing towards Tramac.\nThat sword contained immense power, but\nTran Mack didn't dodge at all. Lamb\nTourett worried silently. Can Tranm\nblock this sword? Only to see Tran Mack\nraise his fist, spiritual energy\ngathering. Seeing this, Lambwan laughed\nloudly, daring to use a fist of flesh\nand blood to block. You are dead for\nsure. Tramac was too lazy to explain,\nswinging a punch, gently neutralizing\nthe attack. The patriarch's eyes were\nfilled with shock, only able to scream\nin horror. No, the result was\npredictable. Lambtoan's entire body was\ntorn in half under the power of that\npunch. However, Tramac was more or less\naffected by that sword, exhaling a\nbreath. This time, the spiritual power\nconsumption was too great. Indeed,\ncannot underestimate a grandmaster.\nWitnessing this cruel scene with their\nown eyes, none of the subordinates were\nnot terrified. The patriarch with\npowerful strength was killed in an\ninstant. Just how strong is this tramac?\nOnly Lamb Tuet secretly rejoiced that\nshe had chosen the right person.\nTranmack was strong enough. Thus, to\nsave their lives, the crowd scrambled to\nrun in all directions. Run fast.\nTranmack's face was as calm as water,\nspeaking coldly. Want to run? One by\none, their bodies were pierced in\nmidair, falling down. After finishing\nup, Tranmack asked, \"The main line of\nthe Lamb family has been destroyed.\nResources cannot be wasted. Can you\ncontrol the Lamb family now?\" Lamb Tuet\ndared not hesitate immediately replying\nas long as young master supports me I\ncan do it. Suddenly her expression\nbecame grave but before that we must\nkill a person. Tramac guess her meaning\nlamb tn nigh I'll leave him to you.\nMoreover tramac thoughtfully took out a\npill. This is the return origin pill.\nYour current realm is external realm\nsmall success. I will help you improve a\nbit so you can manage the lamb family.\nLambuet took the pill repeatedly saying\nthanks. Thank you young master.\nAfterwards, Tranmack prepared to leave,\nsuddenly remembering an issue. The Lamb\nfamily suddenly had so many people die.\nCan you handle the explanation to the\noutside world? Lamb Tuet replied to\nreassure Tranmack. You don't need to\nworry about the martial arts world. The\nlocal government will just turn a blind\neye. Only then was Tranmack reassured.\nSo that's how it is. 3 days later,\nSaitang District, an underground auction\nwas taking place. Yani was also present.\nShe was listening to a friend's\nintroduction. In these kinds of\nunderground auctions, there are all\nsorts of weird things. I heard there are\neven magical artifacts. She was a bit\nstunned. Magical artifacts too. Lou\nconfirmed again. That's right. Haven't\nyou seen one before? I haven't either.\nSo, I beg my uncle to bring me here to\nbroaden my horizons. Didn't expect to\nmeet you here. And he also politely\nreplied, \"Oh, I came with my uncle.\nNothing much to say. Nice to meet you.\"\nAfterwards, she suddenly said\nregretfully, \"If only Tran Matt could be\nbrought here, too.\" Tulu lifted her\nchin, looking arrogant. Humph, that poor\nwretch. He doesn't even have the\nqualifications to enter. At the same\ntime, in the backstage lounge, the\nperson the two girls mentioned was\nactually here. A shy girl asked\ncuriously. Master Tran, why are you\nhere? Tramac didn't mind explaining, \"I\nwas planning to go to Lingu Mountain\nnearby. Just happened to encounter this\nauction, so I stopped by to look.\"\nTranmack added, \"I heard this auction\nwill have a magical artifact.\" The two\nwalked around the showroom. The girl\nenthusiastically led the way. Master\nTran, whether it's a magical artifact or\nnot, I don't understand. The items are\nall here. Please look as you wish.\nChoose as you wish. Tranmack didn't say\nmuch. Suddenly, something caught Tran's\nattention. Tranmack looked closely.\nCatching his eye was a short sword with\nred patterns on the blade, emitting\nfaint spiritual energy, which Tran Mack\ncould also sense. On this sword, there\nis a stream of true essence spiritual\npower left by a true cultivator. It\nseems the so-called magical artifact is\nthis sword. Tranmack held it in his\nhand, liking it quite a bit as long as I\nreach chi condensation level three. I\ncan cultivate the flying sword\nsupernatural power. Finally, Tran Mack\ndecided, I'll take this short sword.\nConsider it owing the Kim family a\nfavor. The girl politely replied,\n\"Master TR is exaggerating.\" Tranmack\nthen prepared to leave. You go do your\nwork, I'll go first. The girl hurriedly\nsaid, \"Let me see you off, Master TR.\"\nShe led him to the main hall where the\ncrowd gathered. Yiani looked confused.\nWhy did Tramac come out from backstage?\nTulu was equally surprised. That is\nTramac. The person beside him is someone\nfrom the Kim family. Suddenly, an angry\nvoice rang out. Master, no. Please, you\nmust help me eliminate that brat. Anyone\nwho dares to approach Kim, boy, Van must\ndie. That was the eldest legitimate son\nof the Noi family. Noi Tu van. Master no\nlooked disdainful. Rest assured, dealing\nwith him is as simple as stepping on an\nant. The next afternoon, Yiani was in a\ngood mood strolling on the mountain.\nAlthough, according to the auction\nannouncement, the magical artifact\nwasn't seen. The scenery of Lingu\nMountain was indeed not bad. Murang Yin\nNi's uncle Ton Kintai panted from\nbehind. Where exactly do the spiritual\nherbs in the mountain grow? We've been\nwalking for so long and still haven't\nseen them. A knock smiled to comfort her\nmaster. If spiritual herbs were so easy\nto find, they wouldn't be called\nspiritual herbs. Then a knock suggested\nthe group ahead. Surely knows the\nlocation of the spiritual herbs. We just\nneed to follow them. Tuan smirked,\nsmiling as he said to Master No, \"There\nare quite a few people going up the\nmountain this time. I'm afraid they are\nall here for the spiritual herbs.\" The\nold man answered sinisterly, \"The more\npeople, the better. Let them fight like\ndogs biting dogs. Only then can we reap\nthe benefits. Suddenly, everyone stopped\nin surprise, looking ahead. Look, is it\nthere? The scenery before them was\nbeautiful. A waterfall poured straight\ndown, forming a large lake at the bottom\nof the cliff, making everyone exclaim,\n\"The waterfall is so beautiful.\" But\nwhat they noticed was a type of fruit\ncalled the scarlet fruit. Growing a leaf\nevery 50 years, bearing a fruit every 50\nyears. It can make martial artists and\ncultivators directly advance one level.\nMaster No confidently declared, \"Only my\nheavenly ghost sect can utilize the\nefficacy of this scarlet fruit to the\nlimit. Later, when I assault the heaven\nrealm, it will be just right to use it\nto build the foundation.\" Tuven\nexcitedly reported, \"Master, I see the\nspiritual herb. Master no beside him\nreassured him.\" Don't get excited.\nObserve the situation calmly first. He\nobserved for a while, warning, \"This\nwaterfall water is black as ink.\nExtremely weird. We cannot act rashly.\"\nTuon shirked, appearing extremely\ncunning. Asking Master, \"No, are they\nall observing too?\" The old man\nimmediately whispered a few sentences\ninto two van's ear. \"You to say this,\"\nnot knowing what was said. He looked\nexcited. Master is brilliant. Then he\nstood in front of everyone and shouted,\n\"Everyone I am no tu van. Please listen\nto me.\" Tu van deliberately suggested\nprovoking a dispute. I won't talk\nnonsense. Everyone is here for that\nspiritual herb. I suggest whoever can\nsnatch the spiritual herb first, the\nspiritual herb will belong to that\nperson. Do you all agree? The crowd\nseemed to waver a bit. This can be\nconsidered away. Those with ability will\nget it right. Someone had already\nstarted taking off their clothes,\npreparing to act. I don't care what\nexactly is in this waterfall. I'll just\nrush in first. He jumped into the lake\nwith a splash, seemingly wanting to swim\nacross. The crowd was incited,\nscrambling to get into the water. This\nis the simplest and most effective way.\nI'll go try too swim over there. Those\npeople rushed forward frantically,\nunaware they had fallen into a trap.\nHaha, this spiritual herb is mine. There\nis hope for Grandmaster. Tu van was a\nbit worried. Master, no. What if he\npicks the spiritual herb? Not knowing\nwhy, this master No was unusually\ncertain. Rest assured, he won't get it.\nThe first person to jump down laughed\ncomplacently. Huh? The spiritual herb is\nmine. But suddenly he sank. Only two\narms waving wildly in the air remaining.\nEveryone immediately stopped, scared,\npale. Then a pool of blood floated to\nthe surface, covered in blood. He poked\nhis head out, screaming, \"Save me!\"\nImmediately after, a crocodile leaped up\nfrom the water. He screamed miserably in\nhelplessness, then was bitten by that\nmonster and dragged underwater right in\nfront of everyone. The remaining people\nwere immediately terrified out of their\nwits, screaming and swimming back.\nThere's a monster. Run fast. Tu van was\nalso pale. Master, no. Is that the\ngolden crocodile? So scary. The old man\npondered and explained. Correct. The\ngolden crocodile here absorbs the\nspiritual energy of heaven and earth\nguarding the scarlet fruit. must\neliminate it first. The scene was now in\nchaos. Fortunately, some people had\nclimbed ashore in time. What exactly is\nthat thing? A monster? To get the\nspiritual herb, we must kill that\nmonster. It's in the water. We can't use\nour strength. Master No. Furiously\nincighted again. A bunch of trash. You\nall hurry and continue down the water.\nLure that beast out. I will eliminate\nit. They naturally dared not obey. Are\nyou telling us to go die? Why don't you\ngo down the water to lure the monster\nand we will eliminate it? The old man\nwas furious, looking at them with\nthreatening eyes. You dare to oppose me?\nThat person argued back fearlessly. So\nwhat if I oppose you? Master knows eyes\nwere cold, reaching his hand forward,\nthen go die. A stream of trueqi gushed\nout, wrapping around that person's body.\nEveryone looked at him motionless,\nfeeling puzzled. What's wrong? What\nhappened? He seems to be petrified. His\nwhole body is pale and motionless.\nMaster no pointed his finger at the\nperson's forehead, pushing him\nbackwards. His soul has been devoured by\nme. He's dead. The crowd repeated in\nhorror. Devoured the soul? How is that\ndone? The old man had seized control,\nopening his mouth to threaten. Now, who\nelse opposes my opinion, not allowing\nhesitation? Master no immediately\nordered. Everyone down the water without\nmy order. No retreating, otherwise you\nwill die more miserably. Everyone had to\ngo down the water one after another,\nobeying his order. Move forward a little\nmore. They were forced to comply.\nSuddenly, among the crowd, another\nperson was dragged underwater. Everyone\ncombined their forces to shoot out\nspiritual energy, shouting loudly,\n\"Attack!\" Afterwards, that giant monster\nwas knocked into a midair by their\npower. Master No continued to command.\n\"Lead it to the shore. Everyone, grit\nyour teeth and persist. Watch me.\" The\nold man seized the opportunity to\nunleash a blade of spiritual energy,\nlaunching it forward. The crocodile's\nupper jaw was hit and it let out a loud\nroar. With just one blow, the old man\neffortlessly ended its life. The severed\nbody of the crocodile fell piece by\npiece into the lake, splashing water\neverywhere. Master No laughed\ntriumphantly at his success, but\neveryone's faces turned pale again, and\nthey hurriedly warned Master No, theirs.\nThere's still more. He immediately fell\nsilent, becoming tense, sweat pouring\ndown like rain. When he turned around,\nMaster No saw a huge mouth opening,\nwaiting for him. Why did another golden\ncrocodile appear? This one was several\ntimes larger than the previous one. It\nroared and rushed to the side of its\nchild's corpse. Even more terrifying, it\ncould speak human language. You killed\nmy child. All of you must die. The crowd\nimmediately went into an uproar. It\ncould actually speak human language.\nThis was the true spirit beast guarding\nthe threeleaf vermilion fruit. No van\nwas unlucky enough to become the first\ntarget. Truly trying to harm others only\nto harm oneself. This was a real\nmonster. That golden crocodile turned\nhim into a pool of blood in the blink of\nan eye. The space fell deathly silent.\nEveryone was frozen stiff. Someone\nshouted loudly, waking everyone up. The\ncrowd immediately fell into chaos,\nrunning for their lives. We can't beat\nit. Run quickly. The foolish master no\nstubbornly refused to realize the truth,\nstaying behind to counterattack. Don't\nbe afraid. Everyone attacked together.\nWe definitely won't be defeated by it.\nThe crocodile pounced, tearing him apart\nwith just one claw. Master No died in\nastonishment, his eyes not even having\ntime to close. Only then did Tonkint Tai\nin terror grab his niece's hand and flee\nas fast as possible. Go quickly. While\nfleeing, Yiani suddenly widened her\neyes. A flash of surprise crossing her\nface. Tranmack calmly walked against the\nflow of the fleeing crowd, bravely\nheading towards the waterfall. Yani\nhurly rushed up to stop him, warning\nTranmack, \"Why are you here? Run\nquickly.\" Tran Mack continued walking\nwithout looking back, his tone firm as\nhe assured her, \"Don't be afraid with me\nhere. You'll be fine.\" The uncle and\nniece stopped in curiosity. Kintai asked\nblankly and repeatedly, \"Where did this\nkid pop out from? He's not running. What\nis he planning to do?\" Tramax stepped\nforward, looking at that giant golden\ncrocodile and doineeringly shouted,\n\"Hey.\" Trared to make a proposal, \"Be my\nmount, and I will spare you from death.\"\nThe giant crocodile thought he was\ncrazy, attacking while cursing, \"Me, be\na mount for you. You want to die?\"\nTranmax's voice dropped, neither happy\nnor sad. \"Refuse? What a pity.\" Having\nsaid that, Tranmack waved one hand,\nunleashing the mountain sunder moved to\nstrike back. The giant golden crocodile\nsuddenly seemed frozen, halting in\nplace, motionless. Immediately after,\nthe monster hurriedly jumped into the\nlake to escape. As long as I guard\nunderwater, you people can forget about\ngetting the threeleaf vermilion fruit.\nThe onlookers immediately buzzed with\ndiscussion. The giant golden crocodile\nwas scared witless. I'm afraid it won't\ndare to come out again. It's invincible\nunderwater. Looks like no one can get\nthe spirit medicine. But only Transmax\nstood dazed, secretly amazed. This giant\ngolden crocodile actually recognizes the\nthreeleaf vermilion fruit, so it\ndefinitely knows its effects. If I let\nit eat the fruit, it will be difficult\nfor me to deal with. Transmac quickly\ncalculated, estimating there was still\nan hour left. However, Tranmax suddenly\nlost patience, secretly deciding, I\ncan't wait any longer. I can only use\nthat move. Seeing Tranmax step forward,\neveryone was terrified. Does he want to\ngo into the water? Is he crazy? He'll be\neaten if he goes down there. Yi also\nanxiously shouted to warn Tranac. You\nhave to be careful. Tranmax slowly took\neach step on the calm surface of the\nlake. Everyone was immediately terrified\nto the extreme. Unable to believe it,\nhovering. What is this? Next, Tran's\nappearance changed. They didn't\nunderstand anything. Just seeing the\nstrange phenomenon and screaming.\nEveryone looked quickly. His hair has\nturned white. He's aged. It seems he is\nusing some secret technique. Ignoring\neveryone's discussion, Tranmack remained\nextremely calm, punched the water\nsurface, dispersing a streak of\nspiritual power, and shouted, \"Part\nwater.\" The water surface crashed and\nstood up on two sides, opening a path at\nthe bottom of the lake. It turned out\nthat giant crocodile was also affected,\nslashed into two segments. After dying,\nit fell with a splash into the lake\nwater in front of Tramac. Tranmack\npanted heavily, looking a bit weak.\nYianni hurriedly ran over to ask, \"How\nare you?\" She solicitously supported\nTran Mack by the shoulder. I'm fine.\nI'll be better after a short rest. Yi\nstared wideeyed, asking blankly, \"Is\nthat monster dead?\" \"Dad, completely\ndead.\" Afterward, Tran Mack turned to\nthe cowardly crowd below, demanding,\n\"You people escort her back safely.\nBehave yourselves. Don't doubt whether I\ndare to kill or not. They hurriedly\npledged. Rest assured, Grandmaster, we\nwill absolutely complete the task you\nassigned. But Yiani seemed reluctant to\nleave, asking curiously, \"Are you\nplanning to get the spirit medicine? I\ncan wait for you.\" Tranmack refused\nwithout hesitation, \"No need. You go\nfirst.\" Seeing Tranm so determined, she\nhad to leave first, then I'll go back\nfirst. You must pay attention to safety.\nTramac replied, \"Okay.\" Tranax stood\nbefore the tree, looking up at the fruit\neveryone wanted to obtain. The threeleaf\nvermilion fruit was about to ripen. At\nthe same time, Tranax smelled a strange\nfragrance. The spirit medicine has\nreached completion. Tranmac couldn't\nwait any longer and reached out to pick\nit. I still don't have a storage\nartifact. I need to refine the threeleaf\nvermilion fruit into a semifinish pill\nto ensure the medicinal efficacy isn't\nlost. Tranmac immediately circulated his\npower. The bright red fruit slowly\nglowed in the palm of his hand. A moment\nlater, Tramac thought happily. Done.\nThen he reached out and picked up that\nsmall leaf, hesitating slightly. I'm\nafraid no one knows that this leaf is\nalso a rare spirit herb. Tranmack fell\nin a deep thought. The pool water here\nis pitch black, concealing extremely\ndense metal attribute origin power. The\nmain reason is Tran Mack suddenly\ncreated a sphere directed towards a\ncertain spot revealing a pile of\nvaluable cultivation resources. Sure\nenough, it's metal essence jade. Metal\nbegets water, causing the pool water\nhere to be pitch black. Tranmax\nspeculated further, \"The metal essence\njade marrow hidden deep here can help my\nmetal body cultivation reach great\ncompletion.\" At the same time, at the\nFatal Valley, some kind of sacrificial\nritual was taking place. A group of\nwomen dressed godily surrounded a fire\npit, dancing and singing with no sign of\nending. Cow Hugh Kuang, unknown how he\nmanaged it, had captured Lambouette,\nholding her in his arms and teasing.\nDon't worry, I will drain every wisp of\neen essence from your body. I won't kill\nyou. Lamb Tuet angrily threatened. My\nmaster will absolutely not forgive you.\nCow Hu Kuang was conversely even more\nexcited. That's great. Saves me the\neffort of finding him. Anyway, as an\nenforcer of the Lamb family, I also have\nto put in a word for Lamb Chuan. At the\nlakeside, the heavenly ghost sect had\ncome to find Tranmack for revenge\nbecause of cow vom's death. Tran Tong\ntoo fought three consecutive battles,\nultimately unable to defeat the two\ndisciples of the heavenly ghost sect\nleader. Hong Tong frowned and asked his\nmaster, \"What do we do next?\" His master\nkicked Tran tongue too, causing him to\nroll on the ground and said\naggressively, \"Kill this Tran tongue\ntoo.\" To avenge Junior brother, Cow Van,\na strange voice rang out, \"No need, just\nguard the two girls accompanying Tran\nTongue Tuesday.\" 3 days later, Tran\nTongue 2 was beaten black and blue, his\nwhole body trembling. Right now at this\nplace, he was forced to send a message\ntelling Tranmac to come and die. In\nfront of him was the heavenly ghost sect\nleader. Cucn sat aggressively\nthreatening. Otherwise, I will make you\nall wish you were dead. Tranmack still\ndidn't know tongue 2 situation and was\nstill cultivating by the lake. Tranmax\nsat cross-legged on the ground. Intense\ntrue energy radiating out. Metal body\ngreat completion. Cultivation entering\nthe third level ofqi condensation. A\nmoment later, Tranmax stopped looking at\nthe object that had become very small in\nhis hand. The metal essence jade marrow\nwas originally the size of a basketball.\nNow only this little bit remains. I'll\nkeep it as a magical artifact. Next,\nTranmac checked the magical artifact\nobtained from the auction. This short\nsword obtained from the auction has also\nbeen finished refining. Suddenly, it\ngradually became indistinct, merging\ninto Tranmax back through the 10,000\nsword sect. I have mastered the first\nlayer of the 10,000 swords art, able to\nhide it inside my body. Tranmack didn't\nknow how long he had been sitting here,\nonly deciding to leave this place when\ndusk fell. The first stage of\ncultivation is over. I can go back. Hong\nwas already very impatient. It's already\nthis time. Has that tramac arrived yet?\nAt this moment, Tran Tongu was\nexhausted, trying to stall for time. The\nyoung master is coming. You guys\nreleased the two girls first. He grinned\nlike a lecher. Rest assured, as soon as\nTramac dies, I will naturally release\nthem. Ctn sap began to lose patience. I\nno longer have the patience to wait.\nKill this old towist first. Hung the\ntong immediately obeyed. Yes. He then\nsummoned a ferocious ghostly shadow.\nLooking at Tran tongue too with\ninterest. He This time I will eat your\nsoul. At this moment, Tran tongue too\ntruly felt fear. Last time he didn't\nrelease the in soul at all. This time he\nwanted to deal a killing blow. He had to\nfight back to save his life. Open\nMountain Hung the Tongzen's soul roared\nin anger, then released several streams\nof air wrapping tightly around Tran Tong\ntoo, who was struggling in pain. At this\nmoment, he was just a fish on the\nchopping block, left for Hong the tong\nto tear apart. Your martial arts are\nvery strong, but your true energy is too\ndepleted. I'll see how many more times\nyou can use it. Tran tongue too fell\ninto danger. silently calling Tranmack\nin his heart. Young master, where are\nyou? Suddenly, a beam of light like a\nmeteor tore through the air, screaming\nas it rushed over. It stabbed straight\ninto the middle of the in soul's body.\nThe in soul was immediately injured,\ncausing Hong the tong to also vomit a\nmouthful of fresh blood and pain. Tran\ntongue too, escaping death, looked at\nthe composed figure in front of him.\nOverjoyed young master hung the tong\nclutched his injured eye still mocking\nunaware of his impending death. Brat\nheard you know the thunder magic of the\nheavenly master sect. Use it for me to\nwiden my horizons. Tranmack readily\nagreed. All right. Having said that,\nlightning immediately condensed in\nTranmack's hand, emitting a sound like\n10,000 birds singing together. Tranmack\ncontinued, \"But it must be exchanged for\nyour life.\" Only CCTN sat had a sharp\neye, his intuition signaling danger, and\nimmediately shouted, \"The tong, you\nidiot. Retreat quickly.\" Then this sect\nleader stood up, releasing a skull from\nhis sleeve, letting it take that blow\nfor Hong the tong. The situation was a\nbit unexpected. Tranmack was slightly\nsurprised, but mostly displeased. Ctn\nsat blocked Hong the tong, angrily\nquestioning Tranmack. You killed my\ndisciple cow vom, you must give me an\nexplanation. However, in the next\nsecond, CCTN sat changed his expression,\nsuggesting acting very magnanimous.\nConsidering your extraordinary aptitude,\nas long as you bow to me as your master,\nthe past will be wiped clean. I will\neven pour out my knowledge to teach you\nand love you dearly. Tranmax seemed to\nfind it ridiculous. You want to take me\nas a disciple? Are you even worthy? The\nnegotiation failed. Ctn sat immediately\nflew up. His whole body radiating\npowerful trueq chi. Since that's the\ncase, you have no way out. His tone was\nextremely decisive. Today, I will show\nyou the strength of a ghost immortal.\nCtn sat roared, urging his internal\nforce. A giant hand appeared behind him.\nAnother ghost claw. He reached out his\nhand. The giant hand also moved along.\nTranmac was not afraid at all. A ghost\nimmortal is not an immortal. His whole\nbody burst forth with strong light,\ncausing the rushing ghost claw to\nhesitate and stop. Ctn sat instinctively\nraised his hand to shield his head. His\ndisciples were in an uproar. Master, how\nare you? He waved his hand. I'm fine. An\nattack of this level cannot hurt me.\nHowever, the strength of this Tranmac\nhas likely reached Grandmaster. The\nothers were stunned hearing his\njudgment. Grandmaster? A Grandmaster at\nsuch a young age? This is impossible.\nEven so, something made CCTN sat\nextremely certain. There must be a\nsecret on this brat. A disciple offered\na plan. Master, capture him. Seize his\nsecret. Our heavenly ghost sect will be\nable to flourish. He agreed without\nhesitation. Good disciples attack\ntogether. Capture him. Tramax hair moved\nslightly. His voice cold. What? Still\nwant to use numbers to bully the few?\nYou chose the wrong opponent. Behind the\nrushing villains were ferocious looking\nevil ghosts. Ctn sat was aggressive now\neven if you want to beg for mercy there\nis no chance he raised his voice to\norder kill him Tramac raised one hand\nwhispering suppress a ray of light shot\nout from Tramax's palm but this light\ngrew larger and larger forming a\nblinding sphere of light those\nilluminated by the light immediately\ndisintegrated eventually turning to dust\nand vanishing before they could even let\nout a scream let his arm drop his body\ntremble ling slightly. This move\nconsumed half of my spiritual power, yet\nit still hasn't killed Cucn Saturday. A\ntransformation realm Grandmaster is\nindeed extraordinary. The old man was\neven more furious. Brat, you wiped out\nthe seeds of my heavenly ghost sect. If\nI don't kill you, I swear not to be a\nhuman. He took out a scroll painting.\nI'll use the heavenly ghost sex mountain\nguarding formation as the price. I must\nturn you into ashes, too. CCTN sat\nopened the scroll, spraying a mouthful\nof fresh blood onto it. Immediately,\ncountless starving ghosts revived,\ncrawling out from the painting. He\ncalled it the 10,000 ghosts great\nformation map, revealing a crazy look in\nhis eyes. 10,000 ghosts destroy the\nworld. Countless lonely souls and wild\nghosts roared and flew out from the\npaper. They gathered into an army\nforming a pitch black cloud. Passers by\nseeing this scene were all terrified.\nThe two girls were horrified. Tang Tang\nexclaimed. So many evil ghosts. Yin\nQuinn Ton muttered. Before I wasn't\nworried, but now. Can Tramac win? Tran\nTongu's face was drained of blood. Young\nmaster. However, the person being\ntargeted didn't put it in his eyes. Just\na tattered formation. And you want to\ndestroy the world? Tran Max summoned a\nsword. I have a sword that can slash\n10,000 ghosts. The blade flew\nautomatically, exterminating the nine\nclans, slashing evil ghosts like slicing\ntofu. Cucen sat trembled all over, fear\nof the strong rising in his heart, his\nanger long since vanished in a smoke.\nOnly a trembling voice remained. Who\nexactly are you? Let me be a ghost who\nunderstands. Tranmack kindly answered\nhim. I'm a cultivator. Ctn sat eyes\nrolled back, constantly repeating\nTranmax's words. Uh uh. Cultivator.\ncultivator. He suddenly looked like he\nwas possessed. Looking up at the sky,\nhis eyes shooting out intense light.\nLight bursting from the inside out. This\nseemed to be the end of those who\nlearned Tranmax secret. Hung the tong\nsted with his mouth open, scared to the\npoint of tears. He cowtowed and begged.\nFrom now on, I'm just a dog of yours. I\nbeg you to spare my life. Tranmack\ndidn't say a word, just stood there\nquietly. A ray of light flashed and the\nbegging stopped. Tranmack turned around\nand instructed Tran tongue too. Your\nlife soul is damaged. The injury is very\nheavy. Need to use spirit nourishing\npill to cure it. I will tell so van hung\nto take you to fine ingredients. He\nbowed his head sincerely. Thank you,\nyoung master. Then Tran Mack assigned a\ntask to Yin Quinton. I still have\nmatters to handle. You responsible for\ntaking care of Tran Tongue Tuesday. She\nreadily agreed. Okay. Returning to the\nwilderness, birds flew and flocks past a\nhouse in the mountains. The furnace was\noperating normally. The difference was\nthat there were many naked girls\nmoaning, \"Save us!\" Their faces were\nflushed, falling into an unconscious\nstate. Two women hugged each other.\nWeakly, crying for help in a corner.\n\"Save me!\" Cow Hu Kuang was only wearing\na pair of shorts, raising a glass of\nwine. \"Welcome.\" Tranmac frowned,\nextremely uncomfortable with this place.\nPlucking in to supplement Yang is\noriginally an evil art that gods and men\ndetest. No wonder you have a hide in\nthis remote toxic forest. Cow Hu Kuang's\neyes were sharp. You saw the cultivation\nmethod I practiced with one glance. You\nhave some skill. No wonder Lamb Chuan\nwas killed by you. However, I'm not\nhiding here. I just don't want to go\nout. This place has green mountains and\nblue water surrounded by beauties. It is\ntruly a fairy land. The smile at the\ncorner of his mouth carried a trace of\nmadness. Otherwise, if I wanted to\nleave, who could stop me? Lamb to it\ntrembled all over. Master, please avenge\nme and my mother. Kill this beast. Cow\nHu Kuang&lt;unk&gt;s rough hand grabbed her\nsmall head. That guy Lamb Chuan\npossessed so many beauties. He deserved\nto die. However, these past few days,\nI've enjoyed quite a bit from her.\nConsider a message to Lamb Chuan. Seeing\nthis, Tranmax anger Rose, I'll send you\nto meet him. Tramac was too lazy to say\nmuch. Attacking directly, Cow Hugh Kuang\ndidn't expect this day would come. His\neyes widened, unable to move in time.\nWhen Trac's fist came down, his huge\nbody hurriedly jumped to the side. The\ntwo created a short distance between\nthem. Tranmack blocked in front of the\ntwo women. You two take the origin\nnurturing pill. Start healing. Lamb Tuet\ntrembled slightly. Thank you, master.\nShe reminded him with some worry.\nMaster, he is an offering of the lamb\nfamily. entered the Grandmaster realm\nfor decades. Cultivated body protecting\nastralqi. His strength is extraordinary.\nHowever, Tran Mack didn't care at all.\nTramax's tone was full of disgust for\nthis kind of scum. Relying on sucking\nwomen's essence to prolong life. I will\ndefinitely send him a hell. Cow Hugh\nKuang jumped up arrogantly. Go to hell,\nbrat. Trac raised his hand to block. A\nbarrier appeared between the two. Tramax\nseemed thoughtful. Body protecting\nAstralchi. It must be a weakened version\nof a cultivator's spiritual protective\nshield. Cow Hu Kuang jumped back in\npanic, but that shield clung to him.\nKid, what hidden weapon is this?\nTranmack replied coldly. This is not a\nhidden weapon. This is the intrinsic\nflying sword of Sword Mountain. Sword\nMountain? He looked confused. That is\njust a character in legends. How can it\nappear in the real world? Tranmack\nradiated killing intent reaching the\nsky. A sword appeared behind him. I once\nslashed immortals and slaughtered\ndragons. Who are you to dare doubt me?\nTramac reached out and grabbed the sword\nhilt. Remember the one slashing you with\none sword is named heaven slash. Tramax\nslashed a sword towards Cowo Hu Kuang.\nSensing danger, Cow Hugh Kuang hurriedly\nexecuted the Inyong destruction fist.\nThe secret technique hadn't finished\nexecuting when it was swept by the sword\nlight. His huge body crashed down. Cow\nHu Kuang's face had turned blue and\npurple by now. His eyes widened this.\nWhat sort of technique is this exactly?\nTrax said indifferently. You don't need\nto know the answer anymore. Cow Hugh\nKuang fell paralyzed to the ground, only\nknowing to admit his mistake and begged\nfor mercy when death was imminent. Spare\nme my money. In this place, these women\nare all yours. Tranmack glanced at him\nwith contempt. Did you turn stupid\nbecause you're about to die? If I kill\nyou, wouldn't these things all be mine?\nLeave him to you to handle. She remained\nprofessional, placing her hand on her\nchest and bowing. Thank you, master.\nTranmack added, \"You arranged for people\nto save these girls out, then search\nthis place thoroughly. Confiscate all of\nthe Lamb family's assets.\" Lamb Tuet\nreplied decisively, \"Yes,\" she found a\nbox, presenting it to Tramac. \"This is\nwhat was hidden under the chair in a\nmain hall. It must be an important\ntreasure of Cow Hu Kuang. Tramac opened\nthe box, taking out a cultivation book.\nSure enough, the book immediately turned\nto ashes. The remaining method is not\nrecorded either. You just handle it as\nyou see fit. Tranmack took out a paper\npackage again. Open it to look. It was a\nring. Tran was overjoyed. Storage ring.\nThis is a good item. Tran immediately\nput it on his slender index finger.\nAlthough the storage space inside is\nonly 45 square meters, it's enough for\nme to use for now. Inside there was also\na piece of cloth. Tranmac raised his\neyebrows carefully examining it. On a\nyellow cloth was written, \"This ring\ncomes from void mountain.\" Bang Singing\nW once said, \"Entering Void Mountain,\none will surely become a Grandmaster.\nLooks like I have to make a trip to\nsearch for cultivation resources.\"\nTramac quickly returned to Saitang to\nsew Van Hungs Villa. Tramac looked at\nthe pile of herbs on the table. Not bad.\nYou guys found all the herbs I need. I\ncan refine the spirit nourishing pill to\nheal. Tran tongue Tuesday. Tramac was\nsecretly satisfied. Seems like these\nrich people are still very useful.\nTranmack didn't spare his praise. You\ndid not bad. I reward you with an origin\nnurturing pill. Guaranteeing your body\nwill be healthy in the future. So Van\nHung thanked respectfully. Thank you,\nGrandmaster Tran. Coten and said\ningratiatingly, \"Grandmaster Tran, I\nalso help find herbs. Look, Tran Mack\nexplained, \"The pills already have\nowners. If you want, you can collect\nherbs according to this pill formula. I\nwill refine them for you.\" Of course,\nmost of the refined pills I will keep as\na processing fee. But he didn't say this\nthought out loud. The old man bowed in\ngratitude, moved. Thank you, Grandmaster\nTR. That bald fat guy mentioned another\nmatter. Grandmaster TR, in a few days it\nwill be the Kien Ang summit. All the\ncelebrities ofQin ang will participate.\nWith your current status and position,\nit's enough to suppress the richest man\nin Kinep. Van Chuang know so he can't\nlift his head. Mentioning this person, a\ncold light flashed in Tranmax eyes,\nclenching his teeth tightly. Van Chuang\nno, general director of Guanghan Group,\nrichest man of Kian. In a past life, he\nruined my family. Tramac made a\ndecision. I definitely want to go to the\nKien Ang summit. However, you guys go\nahead and participate under your own\nnames first. The two wealthy men bowed\nlow. Understood. After speaking, Tranac\nwalked to the bedside. Tran tongue too\nweakly whispered, \"Young master.\"\nTranmack stuffed a small pill into Tran\nTong 2's mouth. This is the spirit\nnourishing pill, \"It can heal your\ndamaged divine soul.\" Tranmac ordered,\n\"Recover your cultivation quickly.\" Tran\ntongue too sat up gratefully saying\nthank you young master for going to such\ntrouble for me. A few days later a full\nmoon hung high. After recovering Tran\ntongue too went to Tranmax's room and\nbowed. Disciple thanks master for the\nlife saving grace. Tranmax sat with eyes\nclosed in meditation opening his mouth\nto say it seems the spirit nourishing\npill helped you gain quite a bit. If not\nfor your short cultivation time and\ninsufficient accumulated trueqi, you\nwould have reached the transformation\nrealm by now. Tran tongue too looked up\nhis eyes firm. Master, this disciple is\nconfident that within 3 months I will\nbecome a grandmaster. Tranmac calmly\nraised his hand. No need to wait. I will\nhelp you become a grandmaster now.\nTranmack began guiding him to circulate\nhis cultivation method. Tran tongue too\nsat cross-legged properly. Yes. Watching\nthe internal force flowing in his body,\nTran Mack chanted a mantra. True Chi\nperfect grandmaster achieved. Tranmack\nplaced his hand behind Tran Tongue Tu's\nhead, his palm glowing. In an instant,\nTran tongue Tu seemed to have an\nepiphany of a new realm. Void, it is the\nvoid transformation realm. Grandmaster\nTran tongue too cowtowed three times.\nMaster's great kindness. This disciple\nhas no way to repay. Tranmack raise an\neyebrow. No need for such polite words.\nStand up and pack a bit. Tomorrow\nmorning, come with me to Kian. Tran Tong\ntoo dared not disobey as you command.\nThe clock was about to strike midnight.\nSuddenly, Tang Tang exclaimed this\npowerful aura. Tran Tong Tu has become a\ngrandmaster. Yan Quinton stood beside\nher looking unhappy. A month ago, Tran\nTong Tu was just like her, an ordinary\nperson. Now he stood at the peak of the\nmartial arts world. She stood up and\nwalked, seemingly having made a decision\nin her heart. What number one beauty?\nWhat wealthy young lady? In the end, one\ncannot escape birth, aging, sickness,\nand death. Only by following Tranmack\ncan one control one's own destiny. Tang\nTang asked suspiciously, \"Miss, where\nare you going?\" The two men were talking\nwhen they heard the commotion. Yin Quinn\nTan stood outside the door with a\nserious expression. Tran Mack raised an\neyebrow, waiting for her to continue.\nI want to take tra as my master. As long\nas you teach me the cultivation method,\nshe expressed without hesitation. I am\nwilling to pay any price. Has she\nmisunderstood something? Tramac was\nconfused and bluntly rejected her. Your\ndetermination is not bad, but you lack\nperseverance. Perseverance. Yen Quinton\npat her chest. From today on, I am your\nmaid, serving tea and water, making the\nbed and folding blankets until you agree\nto accept me as a disciple. Tang Tang\nbeside her could hardly believe it.\nMiss, do you know how to serve others?\nTranmack let out a cold sigh. I'm afraid\nyou can't adapt as well as you imagine.\nThe matter settled. Everyone returned to\ntheir rooms. Tranmack was meditating on\nthe bed when he heard a knock on the\ndoor. Kumain. After a moment of silence,\nhe looked up and what met his eyes was\nYin Quinn Ton wearing sexy pajamas.\nTranmack blushed slightly, watching the\ngirl lie down beside him. She made the\nsituation too awkward, so he had to move\nhis meditation spot to the sofa. Time\nflew by, and in the blink of an eye, it\nwas early morning the next day. An eerie\nsilence. When Tram Mack opened the door\nand walked out, the two people outside\nheard him muttering about gossip,\nwaiting until Yin Quinton walked out\nbehind him with a tired look. Quinton\nsaid, \"Nothing happened at all.\" Tang\nTangs eyes widened, filled with\nadmiration. Too impressive. If it were\nany other man, I'm afraid he would have\npounced long ago. They packed their\nluggage and went to my Hoa group in\nKien. Trram went straight to the\nreception desk. Hello, I'm looking for\nchairman lie. The receptionist asked,\n\"May I ask if you have an appointment?\"\nTramac shook his head. No. She refused\naccording to regulations. Sorry, you\nmust have an appointment. Suddenly, a\ngentle female voice cut in. Qacin seemed\nvery surprised by Tramac's appearance.\nQac, why are you here? She ran over\nenthusiastically and rubbed his head.\nWhen did you arrive? Why didn't you call\nfirst? Tram Mac blushed. I intended to\ngive you and mom a surprise. I didn't\nthink I would need an appointment. Aunt\nwas a bit flustered. This is company\npolicy. Don't mind it. The chairman is\non a business trip. I'll arrange things\nfor you first. Tranmack pointed behind\nhim. I have some friends with me. Please\narrange for them too, sister. When she\nsaw Tran tongue, too. She began to\nquestion life. Why is there someone\ndressed like this? Then she looked at\nYin Quinton. This is on Tin narrowed her\neyes, teasing Mac, could it be that you?\nTranmack immediately denied. Just a\nclassmate. Don't misunderstand. A young\nman following behind on Tin picked his\near, his tone arrogant. Q10 is this\nchairman Lee's good for nothing son\nsternly corrected him banan please call\nme by my full name also please do not\ninsult Tramac Tramac recalled this\nperson's characteristics we ban I have\nsome impression of him he is the son of\na director of my hoa group always\nlusting after onin-2 ban completely\nignored on tin's warning glancing\nsideways at tramac ranked last in the\nwhole school and middle school if not a\nwaste then what is he on tin's face\nturned purple with rage. Say that again.\nChi tweet ban acted indifferent.\nSecretary on watch your attitude. I\ncan't guarantee my father won't withdraw\nhis capital. Mentioning this on tin's\nattitude became wary. Chi twe ban. You\ndare use the company's interests to\nthreaten me. Be careful that director\ndoesn't lose money because of your words\nand actions. He smirked proudly. Anyway,\nI've set my piece. Tranmack cut in at\nthis moment, placing his hand on his\nsworn sister's shoulder. Sister, since\nwhen did my Hoa group allow outsiders to\nact so arrogantly? Then he pulled her\naway from that guy. Let's go. Let's go.\nI want to stay in the presidential\nsuite. TW Bin dare to look down on me.\nAt the anniversary celebration tomorrow,\nI'll show you. Back in the room, on tin\nsummarized the situation for Tramac.\nSigh. The chairman just acquired a piece\nof land for expansion, but the banks\nthat had agreed to lend suddenly changed\ntheir minds, causing my hoa's capital\nchain to break. We can't even find a\nsingle company inqin ang willing to\ncooperate with my hoa. Her voice was\nfull of worry. The chairman feels that\nsomeone might be playing tricks behind\nthe scenes targeting myoa. So, she has\ngone elsewhere to raise capital.\nTranmack asked calmly, \"Is theqin ang\nsummit being held tomorrow?\" Untin\nsmiled, a gentle look appearing on her\nface. That's right. The chairman should\nreturn tomorrow to attend the\nconference. She will definitely take you\nalong. Then she quickly left. You rest\nfirst. I'm going back to the company to\nwork. Before she left, Tramax spoke up.\nSister on worry. Tomorrow all problems\nwill be resolved smoothly. Onin took\nthis as words of comfort. She smiled and\nsaid, \"Yes, it definitely will be.\" Her\nheart was full of determination for the\nchairman and Chumac. I will definitely\nwork hard to help my Hoa hold on to the\nend. She didn't expect that those words\nwere not just comfort. With me here, all\nof my hoest problems will be easily\nsolved. Midnight, the night sky was full\nof stars, the moonlight bright. Sirens\nblared loudly. The entire apartment\nbuilding engulfed in a sea of fire.\nFirefighters were scrambling to\nextinguish the fire. Look, the fire has\nreached the high floors. Can the people\ninside still get out? They were all\nwearing protective gear, but still\nfeared the intensity of the fire.\nCaptain, the big fire has started to\nspread inside the building. Our aerial\nladder only reaches the 20th floor. The\nfloors above are afraid. The man called\nCaptain ordered, \"You stay here to\ncommand the evacuation. The rest follow\nme up. Save as many as we can.\" Another\nperson was full of worry. \"Captain, you\nstay down to command. Let me go.\" The\ncaptain only said decisively, \"Obey\norders.\" Then he commanded his\nsubordinates, \"Brothers, follow me up.\"\n\"Yes.\" At this moment, Tranmack was\nstanding in the building opposite,\nwatching the raging fire. Seemingly\ninfected by the firefighter spirit, he\ntook out a ring. Fire is merciless.\nPeople have heart. I'll give you a hand\nthen. Tranmack chanted a mantra. 3,000\nweakwaters. The ring immediately glowed.\nThunder rumbled and torrential rain\npoured down. A voice rang out from the\ncrowd. It's raining. It's raining.\nEveryone looked up at the heavy rain,\nexclaiming that heaven had finally\nopened its eyes. Strangely, this rain\ncame too timely. It only fell within a\n10-meter radius around building a truly\ntoo coincidental at the public security\nbrigade in a city surveillance hall.\nKong Duk van ordered, \"Everyone pull\nyourselves together. Keep searching.\"\nThe subordinates responded in unison.\n\"Yes,\" Mayor Kong Duk van said in a deep\nvoice. This rain came too conveniently.\nSomeone is definitely controlling it. A\nfew minutes later, he slammed the table.\nStop. enlarged the image on screen\nnumber nine. On the screen was the image\nof Tranmax standing in front of the\nwindow, standing amidst a blue halo with\nrings of emerald green aura radiating\nfrom his body. The mayor's secretary,\nKim Chong Wan's grandson, Kim Tinvu,\nbrought a cup of tea over, his eyes\nlooking at the screen, and whispered,\n\"It's him again.\" Mayor Kong Dukin took\nthe teacup he offered and asked coldly,\n\"You know this person?\" Kim Tinvu\nnodded, hesitating a bit. Yes, but\nseeing this Mayor Kong Duk van\nimmediately said sternly, \"Today's\nmatter is classified as S-level secret.\nAnyone who dares to leak it will be\ndealt with as a spy. Do you hear me?\"\nEveryone in the room responded in\nunison, \"Yes.\" On the other side, in a\nsecret room, Tramac was meditating to\nregulate his breath. Hearing the\ncommotion outside, he opened his eyes\nand muttered, \"She's here.\" outside lie\ndefang stormed in aggressively ignoring\non tin's obstruction you brat roll out\nhere for mom on tin tried to persuade\nher chairman to Mac might not be awake\nyet at this moment a teasing voice came\nfrom inside tramac walked out mom you're\ntoo enthusiastic with me liafong rushed\nover and pinched her son's ear you brat\nnot studying properly what are you doing\nrunning here and dragging yin quinn ton\naround everywhere aren't you afraid the\nyin family will go crazy on you Tran\nMack grimaced in pain and cried out,\n\"Mom, she's the one who insisted on\nfollowing me.\" Lie defang shouted, \"Ba,\nyou definitely took advantage of her.\"\nIn the corner of the room, Tran, Tongu,\nand Tang Tang were peeking and\nwhispering. It seems that in this whole\nworld, the only person who can get angry\nand lay hands on master's master's\nmother. At this moment, Yin Quinton\ntimidly stepped out, whispering, \"Annie,\nyou're here.\" Lie to Fuang immediately\nchanged her tone. \"You must be in\nQuinton. You truly live up to your name.\nWhy aren't you staying at the Yen\nresidence? Why are you traveling with\nTramac? Yinwinn Ton stammered. I am now\nTramax's person. She thought to herself.\nMaid, nanny, reserved disciple. How\nshould I explain this properly? Lie to\nHuang&lt;unk&gt;s eyes widened and her jaw\ndropped. What? She thought. Has it\nreally developed to that stage? Without\nanother word, she punched her son in the\nface. You brat. Did you learn some\nnonsense and ruin a girl's innocence? Do\nyou think you have multiple heads for\nthe Yin family to kick like a soccer\nball? Tranmack rubbed his cheek,\ndefending himself. Mom, I didn't do\nanything. She volunteered. Yin Quinn Ton\nhurriedly interjected. Auntie, it's\ntrue. I am completely willing. Lidwang\nlooked at the two suspiciously, willing\nto be ruined by this brat. Finally, she\ncovered her face, sideighed, and walked\naway. I don't understand you young\npeople's affairs, but pay attention.\nDon't cause a scandal that makes both\nfamilies lose face. Tranmack looked\nhelplessly at his mother. Mom, are you\nmisunderstanding something? Lidang\nquickly cut him off. All right. All\nright. Go get ready and come with me to\nthe Ken Angep inauguration ceremony.\nTramac took out a meticulously wrapped\nbox, his eyes serious yet gentle,\nsaying, \"Right, mom, sister on. This is\na gift I prepared for you, too.\" On Tin\nsmiled with immense joy. This is the\nfirst time you've given a gift to me and\nthe chairman. Open it quickly so I can\nsee. Tranmack opened the box. Inside was\na pair of crystalclear jade pendants.\nLie to Fang exclaimed in slight\nsurprise. Jade pendants? These aren't\ncheap, are they? Tranmack suddenly\nbecame serious, his tone firm. Mom, you\nmust wear this close to your body. He\nthen emphasized every word. We're close\nto your body. Do you remember? Light of\nlooked closely at the jade in her hand\nand nodded slightly. Oh, okay.\nWitnessing this scene, Antin smiled\ninwardly. Little Mac is much more\nsensible now. That's great. Then thin\ninternational trade hotel, the Kin Angep\nSummit was taking place. A voice rang\nout in the noisy crowd. Another person\nchimed in, exclaiming, leaving other\nthings aside, there are really a lot of\nbeauties here. Lie to Fuang stopped\nwalking, turned to look at her son, her\nvoice strict. Tumac on Tin and I are\ngoing to discuss business. You take good\ncare of Quinton. Don't cause trouble.\nTranmack nodded, his face serious. I'm\nthe most well- behaved child. How could\nI cause trouble? Tranmack looked around\nthe main hall, then leaned back in his\nchair, his gaze deepening. In my past\nlife, I really wanted to attend this Kin\nAngep summit, but now it feels dull.\nFame and wealth no longer have value.\nOnly power is the sole mighty capital.\nSeeing a few familiar faces, Tranmack\nnarrowed his eyes slightly, so Van Hung\nand his group are here, too. There are\nalso a few martial artists with decent\nstrength here, including a grandmaster.\nJust then, the host's voice came from\nthe stage, attracting everyone's\nattention. Now, please give a warm round\nof applause to welcome the chairman of\nKang Han Group, Mr. Van Vano stood up,\nhis voice gentle but imposing. It is\nonce again the annual Kengee Summit.\nEveryone sitting here is an elite of\ntheir industry. It is you who uphold the\neconomy of the entire Kien Ang. Everyone\nplease feel free to chat and interact\nfreely together promoting the\ndevelopment of Kien Ang. Enthusiastic\napplause rang out from below the stage.\nA man stepped up smiling and praising.\nChairman Van spoke so well. Vanong no\nsmiled faintly in return. Brother Vong,\nyou are too polite. Please sit. Director\nLouu also took the opportunity to cut in\nhis tone full of flattery. Chairman Van\nhaven't seen you for a few days. You\nlook younger again. Van no shook his\nhand smiling. Brother Louu, I heard you\nreal a few days ago. Seems your recovery\nis going well. At this moment, Lafang\nalso stepped forward trying to keep a\nfriendly expression. President Van, long\ntime no see. Your demeanor is as\nimpressive as ever. But Van Trouang no\nacted as if he didn't hear, brushing\npast her towards another group of\npeople. Lafang froze on the spot, her\nface darkening as she muttered, \"Why did\nVan Trang no ignore me? Van no continued\nto greet others enthusiastically. Come,\ncome everyone, please sit. Lida Fuang\nrefused to give up. She stepped forward\nagain, forcing a smile. President Van,\nlast year we even dined together and\ndiscussed business. Are you a noble who\nforgets things? Not remembering me. Van,\nno turnaround. Speaking in a tone of\ndisgust. Is that so? Then I will\nimmediately have my people stop all\nbusiness contracts with you. Have a safe\ntrip. I won't see you out. A commotion\nrose from the crowd. Someone immediately\nwhispered, \"Hey, look over there. Lie to\nFuang has been turned on by Van Truong.\nNo.\" Another person interjected. \"Looks\nlike the rumors are true.\" Vanong no is\nmaking his move. Lie to Fuang panicked\nbut still tried to ask. President Van,\ncan you explain a little? Vanong no\nshowed no mercy. His tone still icy.\nExplain. Do I have any obligation to\nexplain to you? Just then? Her phone\nrang. Lie to Fuang Hurly answered.\nHello. The secretary's voice on the\nother end was trembling with panic.\nChairman, something has happened. Eight\nshareholders in the company are\ndemanding to withdraw capital and the\nfunding partners you negotiated with\nbefore have also suddenly changed their\nminds. Lafang was stunned. What? The\nsecretary's voice continued. The van\nfamily and several other families want\nto terminate cooperation with us. The\nphone slipped from her hand, falling to\nthe ground. The voice on the other end\ncontinued to call out distractedly.\nChairman, what should we do? but\nreceived no response. The secretary\ncalled out again, \"Chairman,\" while the\natmosphere of the banquet was tense,\nhurried footsteps suddenly came from\noutside the main hall, attracting\neveryone's eyes. Whispers erupted in the\ncrowd. \"It's the directors of my Hoa\ngroup.\" A group of people marched\naggressively into the hall, drawing\neveryone's gaze. Someone whispered,\n\"What are they doing here? Are they here\nto support my Hoa?\" The leader, Chiong\nHoa, went straight to Van Trong no and\nbowed respectfully. \"Mr. Van, we have\nwithdrawn from my Hoa group. Hoping to\ndo business with you in the future. Van\nTruong no immediately spread his arms,\nwelcoming them with a beaming face.\nWelcome. A warm welcome. Tranmax sneered\ninwardly. I'm Vanin. It's not too late\nfor you to beg me to take care of you\nnow. Van Trong. No. Immediately\nannounced loudly, his voice echoing\nthrough the hall. Anyone who supports my\nHoa today is an enemy of my van family.\nThe hall immediately filled with noisy\nchatter. Sure enough, lie to Fuang was\nbeing targeted. Shareholders withdrawing\ncapital. Myoa is finished. Lie to Fuang\nwhispered weakly. My ho doesn't have\nenough capital. And now being divided in\nfront of everyone like this, no one will\ninvest anymore. Just then, a calm voice\nrang out in the silent space. Who is it\ndaring to sit down next to lie? To flang\nright in the eye of storm. Tranmack led\nhis people slowly in, nonchalantly\nsitting down in front of his mother and\nsister. Someone immediately cut in. The\nold man next to him looks like an\nexpert. Those two women are really\nbeautiful. At the same time, bursts of\ncontemptuous laughter rang out. That's\nLieafong's son. Truly a piece of trash.\nHe's that idiot who always ranks last in\nexams. With a son like that, my hoa is\ndoomed sooner or later. Anon stepped\nforward and asked to Mac, \"What are you\ndoing here?\" Lie to Fuang said sadly to\nMac, \"Go back quickly. Don't stay here\nand lose face with mom.\" But Tramac\nlooked straight at her, his tone firm.\nMom, I can say my hoa. Lie to Fuang\nglared at her son, growling low. What\ntime is it now? Still boasting on spoke\nsoftly, her tone worried. Chumac, go\nquickly. The chairman is protecting you.\nTranac turned to look at the two, his\ntone determined. I've grown up now. It's\nmy turn to protect you, too. Having said\nthat, Tranmack walked to a chair and sat\ndown with his legs crossed. His posture\nrelaxed yet arrogant. Tranmack's voice\nrang out like a declaration with me\nhere. No one could touch my Hoa group.\nThose who had flattered Van Trung no\nimmediately sneered. Shameless. You're\njust a student. Luckily, I didn't\ncooperate with my Hoa. Otherwise, I\nwould have been killed by this idiot.\nTramac was too lazy to respond. He just\npointed his hand forward, his voice\nresounding. Now I ask, who is willing to\nhelp my Hoa group resolve this crisis?\nThe air seemed to stagnate for a moment.\nThen a man stood up, his majestic voice\nringing out. And lamb Tinac son, willing\nto use all my strength to help my Hoa\ngroup. Van Trong knows expression\nchanged, muttering in confusion. Tiny\nson is the local tyrant of Enam. Always\non good terms with me. Why would he\npublicly stand up to support my Hoa\ngroup and oppose me? Immediately after,\nlike a rising tide, a series of shouts\nechoed through the hall. Saitang,\nlong,\nwe are willing to use all our strength\nto help my Hoa group. Coten and stepped\nout, walked up to Tranmack and bowed\nrespectfully with clasp hands. Mr. Tran.\nTranmack nodded. Boss Co, thank you for\nyour hard work. Coten and smiled\nsincerely. Mr. TR is too polite. This is\nall thanks to Mr. TR's blessing giving\nus a chance. Whispers arose in the\ncrowd. Half of the bosses in the\nconference have responded to Tranmax\nwords. Onin was stunned into silence.\nEyes wide, unable to believe the scene\nbefore her. What is going on? Lie to\nFuang was moved to tears, bowing in\nthanks. Thank you. Thank you everyone.\nSo Van Hung laughed heartily. Chairman\nlie, this is what we should do. Please\ndon't be polite. Coten and nodded\nseriously. Regarding investment,\ncooperation or connections, everything\nwill follow Chairman Lee's orders. Van\nno clenched his fists, anger flashing in\nhis eyes as he looked straight at\nTramac. Speaking coldly, \"Brat, you have\nsome skill. But your my hoa group has\nprovoked someone you shouldn't have. No\none can save you today.\" He suddenly\nshouted, \"Brother lie.\" From afar, came\nthe majestic voice of a middle-aged man.\nEach word like thunder. Unexpectedly,\nLidang's son has such a large network of\nconnections. Everyone's eyes turned\ntowards the man slowly walking into the\nhall. Curiosity spread throughout the\nmain hall. Who is this? Someone\nwhispered. The Lie family? Could it be\nthat big shot from the Lie family?\nUnless it is. Lie to Fuang's eyes\nwidened as she looked at Lie Fuang's son\napproaching. So that's it. Tramac\nfrowned, his gaze darkening. History\nseemed to have changed. In his past\nlife, my hoist crisis had nothing to do\nwith the lie family. But this time, it\nwas entirely orchestrated by the lie\nfamily. So Van Hung's eyes widened,\nunable to believe his ears. The Lie\nfamily. Kenan also couldn't hide his\nsurprise. Lowering voice indeed a super\nfamily. Can Master Tran resist the Lie\nfamily? Liuang son stepped forward, his\ncold gaze sweeping over everyone, saying\nruthlessly, \"I, Liuang son, under family\norders will destroy your myoa. Do you\nsubmit?\" Lafa Fuang stood stunned on the\nspot. A bitterness rising in her heart.\nShe silently resented. \"Father, you\nreally act viciously. I know the Lie\nfamily's terrible methods too well.\nThere is no need to resist anymore.\"\nThen she stepped forward, bowed to my\nHoa supporters, and said sincerely, \"I\ntruly thank you all for helping in times\nof trouble, but my hoa cannot implicate\nyou.\" So Van Hung looked at Tranmack in\na dilemma. \"Master Tran, look.\" Tranm\nstill sat there calmly, consistent as\never. The corners of his mouth curled up\nin a cold smile. \"You are just a servant\nof the Lie family, not qualified to\nshout in front of me.\" Lifelong son\nimmediately sneered, shouting loudly.\nRest assured, the patriarch has prepared\nsomeone qualified for you. Finishing his\nwords, he shouted, \"Grandmaster lie,\nplease take action.\" As soon as the\nwords fell, a figure quietly appeared.\nIt was an old man, his whole body\nradiating a majestic aura, shaking the\nentire hall. Whispers rose from all\nsides. Is this the legendary martial\nartist? Is that still a human? Is this\nmagic? Lifelong son immediately clasped\nhis hands, bowing respectfully.\nGrandmaster lie. Thank you for your\ntrouble. Lie long. Kai looked towards\nTramac. His eyes deep as an abyss. Kid,\nyour aptitude is not bad. Unfortunately,\nyour path is narrow. Tramax seemed to be\nthinking. The lie family is not a small\nfamily. Surely there isn't just him\nalone. He looked up, looking straight at\nthe Grandmaster in front of him, his\neyes showing no fear. Lie Dong Duong.\nSurely didn't just send you alone,\nright? Anyone else? Come out all at\nonce. I'll deal with it in one go. Li\nLong Kai clenched his fists. This Brad\nis so arrogant. He doesn't put a\ngrandmaster in his eyes. Since it's like\nthis, then use your life to regret it.\nTran Matt curled his lips in disdain.\nReally, just you alone? Then I don't\nneed to take action. He raised his hand\nto signal Tran tongue too. You go. Tran\ntongue too nodded respectfully. Yes. At\nthis moment, the whole hall exploded.\nLook, another Grandmaster. Oh my god.\nAre grandmasters becoming cabbages in\nthe market now? Lafang asked her son\nquietly. Little Mac, is this your\nmysterious master? Tranmack nodded\nfaintly, uttering, a yeah. Law and Kai\nlooked at Tran tongue too wearily. I\ndidn't expect there to be a grandmaster\nby your side, too. But are you sure he\ncan protect you? Tranmack lazily leaned\nback in his chair. He is not here to\nprotect me now, but to kill people. Lie\nlong, Kai roared in anger, his body\nrushing forward like lightning, killing\nintent soaring to the sky. Arrogant die.\nTran tongue too showed no fear. Also\nrushing up to meet the battle. What a\ncoincidence. I also have a punch here\nfor you to taste. Two auras collided\nlike two mountains in midair. Mountain\nbreaker. A shout echoed through heaven\nand earth. Lie. Long kai flew backward.\nBlood spurting from his mouth and nose.\nHis body falling heavily to the ground.\nSomeone in the crowd exclaimed. One\npunch seriously injured a grandmaster.\nLif Wong's son stared wideeyed and\nopen-mouthed, muttering, \"Don't grand\nmasters need to fight hundreds of rounds\nto determine the winner? How could one\npunch?\" Li Long Kai lay on the ground,\nhis voice trembling. \"What fist\ntechnique did you use? Why is it so\nfierce?\" Tran tongue's voice was icy. A\ndying person. Does Ani know too much?\nLiong Kai was terrified to the extreme,\nhurriedly begging, \"Stop! You cannot\nkill me. None of you can bear the wrath\nof the Lie family.\" Tramac looked down\nat him, his voice cold as ice. If your\nlive family fights openly and honestly\nin the business world, \"My hoa will\naccompany you to the end.\" He raised his\nhand and made a gesture of cutting his\nthroat, every word like a knife. If you\nwant to use underhanded methods, then\nlet's see how many grand masters your\nlive family has for me to kill. I\nguarantee I'll kill until your live\nfamily has no one left. Tran tongue too\nwould not easily let go of this\nopportunity. He rushed forward, mocking,\n\"Go slowly. I won't see you off.\" Liong\nKai panicked and retreated, shouting,\n\"If you kill me, you will pay a heavy\nprice.\" The words were not yet finished.\nA punch carrying the power of thunder\nfrom Tran Tongue. Two smashed heavily\ninto his abdomen. Lillong Kai was sent\nflying, landing in the middle of the\nhall, no longer breathing. Lifelong Sun\nand the others were dumbfounded. One\nperson couldn't help but utter. Two\npunches beat a grandmaster to death.\nSome people couldn't believe their eyes,\nmuttering, \"Aren't they both\nGrandmasters? Why is the gap so big?\"\nTranmack sat calmly on the chair. His\neyes calm. He calculated in his heart.\nEven if Lonkai entered the\ntransformation realm a few years earlier\nthan Tran Tong 2, the cultivation method\nand martial arts he practiced are 100\ntimes inferior to what I passed on to\nTran Tongue Tuesday's day. If Tran\ntonged too couldn't even beat him, then\nI would have to change disciples. Then\nTranmack glanced at Lie Wong's son. His\nvoice calm but cold. Go back and tell\nLie Dong Duong. In 3 years, I will make\nthe live family kneel before me and\nrepent. Lieong's son shuddered, nodding\nslightly. I will pass the message to the\npatriarch. Now, can I go? Tranmack\nreplied coldly. Scram. The atmosphere in\nthe hall seemed to freeze. Onin murmured\nsoftly. Turns out the live family is not\ninvincible at this moment. Vantron no\nalso found an excuse to slip away. His\nface pale. I feel a bit unwell. I'll\nleave first. Tramac watched his\nretreating figure, his eyes deep and\ncalculating. Although he really wanted\nto destroy the van family. Now is not\nthe time. At this moment, everyone in\nthe hall surrounded Lie to Fuang,\npraising her endlessly. Chairman Lie\ngave birth to such a good son. If my Hoa\nneeds any help, I will definitely help.\nLie to defaang nodded emotionally. Good,\ngood, good. Thank you everyone. Those\nwho had joined Van Chuang no in mocking\nmy hoa now also scrambled to flatter. We\nbeg on our knees to cooperate with my\nhoa at the lie family mansion. Hearing\nlie fuang son's report lie lap van was\nsurprised. Is that true? Lie dong duong\npondered for a moment and said I didn't\nexpect the grandmaster beside him to be\nso formidable. Li Lap Vanam looked at\nhis father cautiously and asked,\n\"Father, do we need to invite that\nperson down from the mountain?\" Lie Dong\nDuong shook his head slightly, \"No, it\nhasn't reached that point yet. But for\nnow on, we will only use secular forces\nto encircle my Hoa group.\" People in the\nmartial arts world cannot arbitrarily\ninterfere in secular matters. He\nwouldn't dare to violate this rule. Hi,\nAngep City, Fuang Sun District in a\nhigh-end department. Lie to Fuang said\nwith a hint of reproach. Tomorrow is New\nYear's Eve and your father is still\nworking. She snorted softly. Humph\nacting as if Fuang's son district would\nbe paralyzed without him. Then she\nturned to Tran Tongue too, smiling\nwarmly. Master Tran, everyone please\nmake yourselves a home. Don't stand on\nceremony. Tran Tongue too didn't know\nwhat to say, complaining silently in his\nheart. Mrs. Lie, don't keep calling me\nMaster TR. My little heart can't take\nit. Tranmack looked at the people\nfollowing behind him, sighing in his\nheart. He originally intended to let\nthem go home for Ted, but Yin Quinn Ton\nand the others insisted on following.\nTruly troublesome. Suddenly, there was a\nnoise outside the door. It was\nTranmack's father's voice. Huh? Everyone\nis back. Why didn't you call me? Seeing\nhis father, Tran Mack recalled the\nevents of his past life and fell silent.\nFather always wanted to rely on his own\nstrength, working hard to prove himself\nto the Lie family and the Tran family.\nBut in his previous life, he failed. He\nstill remembered the regretful look in\nhis father's eyes on his deathbed. He\nlooked at his father with determined\neyes. Father, in this life, I will\nfulfill your wish, letting you prove\nyour ability in front of the live family\nand the Tran family. The dining table\nwas filled with sumptuous dishes.\nTranmac's father happily picked up food\nfor Tran Tongue, too, saying\nenthusiastically, \"So is Master Tran.\nThank you for taking care of our little\nMac.\" K. Cheers. must drink until drunk.\nTran tongue too could only smile\nawkwardly in response. Ah, yes. Then\nTranmax father turned to the two girls\nbeside him, his voice affectionate.\nQuinton Tang Tang eat don't be polite.\nDinner ended. Everyone moved to the\nliving room. At this time, Tramax's\nfather suddenly became serious. Little\nMac after Tet, you will have to\nparticipate in the commercial war\nassessment of our Tran family in Gduon.\nThe Tran family is a merchant family.\nThere's a family rule called commercial\nwar. Every 5 years, young people in a\nfamily from 18 to 23 years old will\nreceive a sum of capital to learn\nbusiness. At the annual meeting each\nyear, the public will vote for the three\npeople with the greatest progress and\nachievements for the family to focus on\nnurturing. Tramac nodded. Father rest\nassured, I will definitely win first\nplace for you, bringing glory to you.\nHis father laughed loudly. His brat\ntalks big. Father cannot help you with\nanything. Everything depends on\nyourself. Lie to Fuang sitting beside\nimmediately chimed in. If your father\ndoesn't help, mom will help. Then she\nturned to Tran Tongue Too, her eyes full\nof trust. Moreover, I believe Master TR\nwill absolutely not stand by and watch.\nTran tongue too smiled and nodded. That\nis natural. Natural. Tranmax's father\ncontinued, \"Wait until after tech. The\nTran family will provide you with\nstartup capital. Don't spend it\nrecklessly. Learn how to invest and do\nbusiness well. If you lose all the\ncapital, we will become a\nlaughingstock.\" Tramac nodded seriously.\nFather rest assured, saying that, he\nstood up. \"Father, mother, I'm going out\nfor a walk.\" Gathering with some\nfriends. Tramax's father wave his hand.\n\"Go, go. Just don't cause trouble.\"\nLidwong didn't forget to remind her son.\nDon't bully others. Tran tongue too\nfollowed him out. Just arriving at the\napartment complex gate, Tranmack took\nhis phone out of his pocket. He thought\nto himself, first called damn Thursday\nsin. The phone rang for a long time\nbefore someone picked up. Tranmack\nfrowned and asked, \"What's wrong?\" Took\nso long to answer. A slightly awkward\nvoice came from the other end. No,\nnothing. The phone was on vibrate.\nDidn't hear it ring. Tranmack narrowed\nhis eyes slightly. A trace of suspicion\nrising in his heart. Damn Thursday.\nSin's tone was a bit abnormal. Then Tran\nMatt continued, \"I'm back. Call two how\nand tuning too. Let's meet up.\" Damn\nThursday. Sin hesitated for a moment\nthen replied this. \"Okay, where are you?\nI'll tell two how to come pick you up.\"\nTranmac said briefly, \"I'll wait for you\nguys at the apartment complex gate.\"\n\"Okay, see you later.\" Damn Thursday\nfinished speaking and hung up. Tranmack\nstared at the darkened phone screen, his\neyes becoming deep. In his previous\nlife, he hadn't heard of damn Thursday\nsince being in any trouble. But perhaps\nbecause of his rebirth, things had\nchanged. A moment later, a car stopped\nat the apartment complex gate. Two two\nhouse sitting in the passenger seat\nrolled down the window and waved. Hi,\nLittle Mac. Damn Thursday since stuck\nhis head out from the driver's seat.\nLittle Mac, get in the car. Tranmack and\nTran tongue too got into the car\ntogether. As soon as they were seated,\nhe asked, \"How have you two been\nlately?\" Damn Thursday. and drove and\nlaughed. Definitely not as good as you.\nYou got into the best high school in Ken\nafter all. Tutu how looked at the person\nsitting next to him, asking Tran Mack\ncuriously, who is this? Tramac answered\nsimply, \"A friend of mine. We're all\nfamily here. No need to be formal.\" Then\nTran Mack turned his head and asked, \"By\nthe way, where is Tunim? Isn't she\ncoming?\" Tutuh How answered him, \"She'll\ncome find us later.\" Arriving at the\nrestaurant, the three chose a decent\nseat. Damn. Thursday since said\nexcitedly, \"Little Mac, hurry up and\norder your favorite dishes. It's my\ntreat today.\" Tran Mack glanced at the\nmenu, smiling. Then shall I order one of\neverything\npretending to shout, \"Fine. You really\naren't polite, are you?\" Footsteps were\nheard from outside. Tutu Howa looked at\nthe door, saying happily, \"It must be\nQ.\" Immediately after, Nepunim walked\nin. Tutu How waved. You're here.\nTranmack looked at the girl, his brows\nfurrowing involuntarily. There was a\nfluctuation of spiritual energy on\nTunim's body, appearing and\ndisappearing, strong and weak like a\nheartbeat. So, she was planted with a\ndemon seed long ago. Tramac pondered,\n\"The demon seed is the Daoart demon\nplanting grand method of the heavenly\ndemon clan. A woman planted with a demon\nseed will become a furnace. Having her\ninh harvested to supplement Yang by the\ncaster, causing their cultivation to\nsoar. As for the furnace, due to the\ndemon seed being extracted, her essence\nblood will be exhausted and her whole\nbody will turn into a dried corpse. Trax\nsecretly clenched his fist. In the past\nlife, Nepunim suddenly went missing. I'm\nafraid this was the outcome. His gaze\nbecame firm and cold. But in this life,\nI absolutely will not let that outcome\nhappen again. Tranmack immediately stood\nup, smiling and waving at the girl\nwalking over. Tun, long time no see.\nCome sit down. Tran Mack calculated in\nhis heart. The demon seed in Tunim's\nbody was only planted using an\nincomplete demonic art. I can easily\nextract it. I want to see exactly which\ndemon or ghost is wreaking havoc here.\nNepunim sat down looking at the person\nopposite her. an indescribable emotion\nsuddenly rising in her heart. That\nperson is She laughed, asking, \"Little\nMac, you're back. I thought you went to\nthe provincial capital and forgot about\nthis bunch of friends.\" Damn. Thursday\nSin frowned and said, \"What else? If it\nweren't for the holidays, when would he\never be willing to come back for a\ntrip?\" Tutu, how hurriedly smiled to\nmediate, \"All right, all right, hurry up\nand order.\" A table of food was served\none by one. The atmosphere seemed to\nsoften a bit. At this moment, Trax\nsuddenly spoke up, his voice serious.\nRight. If you guys encounter any\ndifficulties, you can tell me. Maybe I\ncan help you resolve them. The other\nthree were stunned, looking at each\nother. Nepunim laughed, breaking the\nsilence. What trouble could we have?\nYou're overthinking it. Suddenly, damn\nThursday since slammed the table and\nstood up, his tone angry. Tranmack, do\nyou feel that I, Damn Thursday sin, am\nnot your equal? Matters that I can't\nresolve. On what basis can you resolve\nthem? Tut two, how immediately frowned.\nAren't you overreacting? Isn't little\nMac just caring about us? Why turn\nhostile so suddenly? Tranmack remained\nsilent. Damn Thursday. Sin gritted his\nteeth, his voice trembling with anger.\nYou think relying on connections to get\nto the provincial city makes you\nsuperior. You clearly aren't as good as\nme at anything. Yet you always ride on\nmy head. He looked straight at Tramac,\ncoldly declaring, \"Since it's like this\ntoday, let's make it clear. From now on,\nour friendship is severed. Tutuh how\ncouldn't hold back anymore, shouting,\n\"Damn, Thursday's sin. Did you take the\nwrong medicine?\" Nepunim also worriedly\nsaid, \"Stop talking nonsense. It hurts\nour feelings too much.\" Tran Mack, who\nhad been silent all this time, picked up\na glass of beer, filled it, then raised\na glass towards damn Thursday sin, then\ndrank it all in one breath, not leaving\na drop. Damn Thursday. Sin picked up a\nbeer bottle, chugged a large mouthful,\nand dropped a short sentence. Fine.\nAfter speaking, he turned and walked\naway. He coldly left behind a sentence.\nYou guys just eat. I'll pay. Tutu stood\nup abruptly. He we sigh. Let me go find\nhim and talk. Nepunim quietly watched\nhis retreating back, murmuring sadly. I\ndidn't expect things to turn out like\nthis. Little Mac. She hadn't finished\nher sentence when Tran Mack interrupted\nher. It's okay. I won't take what he\nsaid to heart. He looked straight into\nher eyes. Voice serious. Now it's just\nthe two of us left. Can you tell me your\nstory? Nepunim lowered her head, her\nvoice trailing off, then stood up. What\nstory could I have? I can't swallow this\nmeal anymore either. Let's disperse.\nTranmack watched her leaving figure. His\nface darkening. He lowered his voice and\nordered, \"Follow her. Don't alert the\nsnake in the grass.\" Tran tongue too\nnodded in response. Yes. Outside the\nrestaurant, insect expert unmed deep and\ncross his arms over his chest, leaning\nagainst the car door. His cold eyes\nlooked at the person who just walked\nout. Warning, you stayed too long.\nMaster doesn't like you interacting with\nthose brats. You will harm them. Nepu\nNim's voice became harsh. I already said\nI won't do anything to betray master. If\nyou dare touch them, don't blame me for\ndestroying both the jade and the stone.\nThe corner of Un deep bin's mouth curled\nup revealing a scornful smile. I'm just\nreminding you you should understand your\nidentity clearly. Nepunim didn't bother\npaying attention to him anymore. Pulled\nthe car door open and sat inside saying\nirritably no need for your nonsense.\nUnde deep in was choked off silently\nclosing the car door. In a hidden corner\nnearby, Tran tongue too hid himself\nhearing the conversation clearly his\nface darkening. He immediately returned\nto report to Tramac. Afterward, they\nalso left. After listening, Tranac\nnodded slightly. I know. At this moment,\nTutuh How walked in, his face full of\nworries, saying, \"Tran Mack, don't take\nThursday sins words to heart. He has his\nown difficulties.\" Tranmack looked at\nhis friend, speaking softly. Don't\nworry, I realized it long ago. What\ntrouble is he in two house side?\nThursday's family and our classmate Ho\nKim Ho's family both run hotels. They\nhave always been sworn rivals. You know,\nthe Kim family intends to build a chain\nof high-end clubs in Fuang Sand County.\nBoth families went to seek out young\nMaster Kim. As a result, young Master\nKim chose Ho Keem Ho's side, kicked\nThursday sin out, and said some very\nnasty things. Tramac frowned. Young\nMaster Kim, the Kim family. Tutu, how\ncontinued. I heard next year the Ho\nfamily will rely on the Kim family's\nbacking to swallow up Thursday since\nfamily hotel. Sigh. Thursday since\npressure is too great. So he said those\nwords. Tranmack pondered for a moment,\nthen patted his friend's shoulder. All\nright, I know. I will resolve this\nmatter. Tutu, how frowned. You can\nresolve it. Trans answer, just waved his\nhand, his voice light as a breeze.\nRight. Happy New Year. On the first day\nof the Lunar New Year at Tuh High run by\nthe Damn family. Damn. Thursday, Sin\nwore a well-ironed suit, clasping his\nhands and bowing and greeting, \"Happy\nNew Year. Zam singo\nsaying to the guests, \"Please come in.\nPlease come in. The private room is\nready for you.\" Hoan Vilet's son Hokim\nHo inside. He clased his hands and\nlaughed falsely. Brother Dam, happy new\nyear. Damn. Kuang Hoy returned the\ngesture. Brother Ho, happy new year.\nJust as they sat down, Ho Vanv sneered.\nBrother Dam, this two high hotels\nbusiness is getting better and better,\nisn't it? Damn. Kuang Hoy maintained a\ngeniality. Mr. Ho is joking. I still\nhave to strive a lot. Standing beside\nhis father, Hokeim Hoa raised his voice.\nSeems like you know your limits.\nCompared to our Hong hotel, this place\nof yours is no different from a public\ntoilet.\nMr. Hong, today is the first day of the\nnew year. If there's any matter, can we\ntalk about it after today? Hanvi raised\nhis hand to stop him, speaking slowly.\nBrother Dam, I have no choice either.\nYoung Master Kim requested that I must\nquickly reorganize the hotel industry in\nFuang San County. Hokim Hoa held up\nthree fingers. Young Master Kim gave a\nprice. 3 million to buy out this\ntattered place of yours. Damn Thursday\nsince stood up in indignation. 3\nmillion. Our two high hotel is worth at\nleast 20 million. Hokeim Hoa curled his\nlips looking nonchalant. 3 million is\nalready a lot. Otherwise, think about\nit. Who else dares to offend young\nmaster Kim to come support this tattered\nhotel of yours? Dam Kuang Hoy said\nfirmly, \"Too high is my life's work. I\nhave no intention of giving it up.\"\nHovanvi stood up, his eyes bone\nchillingly cold. \"Brother Dam, don't\nrefuse a toast only to drink a forfeit.\"\nZamuan anglam,\nsee the guests out. Damn Lamb stepped\nforward, extending his hand in a gesture\nof invitation. Mr. Ho, please. But the\nguard tam of the whole family darkened\nhis face and rushed forward throwing a\npunch heavy as thunder. Damn Lamb\ncollapsed on the spot, clutching his\nstomach and groaning. Damn Thursday. Sin\nhurriedly supported him. Brother, how\nare you? Damn lamb hissed in pain.\nSecond uncle. He is a martial artist. He\nalone can easily destroy our entire damn\nfamily. Hovan Vice stepped forward,\npatted Dam Kong Hoyy's shoulder, smiling\nyet not smiling, saying, \"Brother Dam,\nout of respect for our many years of\nacquaintance, I advise you one thing.\nDon't resist in vain.\" Damn Kuang Hoy\nclench his fists, feeling only a\nhelplessness and despair choking his\nthroat. Just then, the door to the room\nwas forcefully pushed open. A familiar\nand decisive voice rang out. \"Uncle Dam,\nI've come to wish you a happy new year.\"\nEveryone's eyes immediately turned\ntowards the door. Damn Thursday Sin\nangrily pointed at the door, his voice\ntense. Tranmack, what are you doing\nhere? Go back quickly. Damn Kuang Hoy\nalso frowned, his voice low but carrying\na bit of gratitude. Tranmack, thank you\nfor coming today. I accept your\nkindness. Another day, I will take\nThursday sin to your house to wish a\nhappy new year. Now you go back first.\nTranmack walked straight to the middle\nof the room. Voice decisive. Uncle Dam,\ntoday I came not only to wish a happy\nnew year, but also to discuss a business\ndeal with you. He paused for a second,\nthen said each word clearly. I want to\nbuy two high hotel. The atmosphere in\nthe room instantly became as taught as a\nbow string. Hokeim Hoa frowned and\nlaughed coldly. Tranmack, what is a\npiece of trash like you doing here\ncausing trouble? Even if you rely on\nyour mother's assets to have some money,\nyou can't afford a hotel. Besides, do\nyou dare to go against the Kim family?\nDamn Thursday since stepped forward. His\nface full of worry. Tranmack, don't make\na mess right now. It's the Kim family\nwho is. He hadn't finished his sentence\nwhen Tran Mac seriously interrupted.\nUncle Damn, you just name a price I will\nbuy it unconditionally. Damn. Thursday\nsince stepped forward to pull his arm,\nhis voice pleading, \"Little Mac, hurry\nand go. Considerate me begging you.\"\nTramac turn his head back. His eyes\nserious and firm. Thursday sin. I've let\nyour family name the price as you\nplease. Is that enough sincerity? Why\nare you chasing me away? Hovan Vi huffed\ncoldly, his eyes scornful. Mr. Tam,\nplease trouble you to kick this brat\nout. Gartam nodded, stepping forward a\nstep. Easy enough, helping eldest young\nMaster Kim with his work. Anyway, seeing\nhim approach damn Thursday since face\nturned pale, his voice trembling.\nTranmack, do you see? If you cause any\nmore trouble, you'll lose your life.\nTramax sneered, eyes sharp as knives.\nJust a petty external real martial\nartist. He raised his hand. True chi\nerupting, unleashing a simple move. Get\nlost. Gardam was blown away like a dry\nleaf in a storm. Rolling several times\non the ground. His face drained of\nblood. He looked at Tranmack,\nstammering, released true. You are a\ntransformation realm Grandmaster. Tramax\nstepped forward, bending down to look\nhim straight in the eye, the corner of\nhis mouth curling into a cold smirk. If\nwe weren't in Uncle Dam's hotel, you\nwould be dead already. Guard Tam\nimmediately knelt on the ground,\ntrembling all over, cowtowing\nrepeatedly. It was I who had eyes but\nfailed to see Mount Thai offending the\nGrandmaster. Please, Grandmaster, spare\nmy life. What? Hokeim Hois expression\nchange in horror. Face turning pale.\nHoanvi also stepped back in\nastonishment. How is that possible? Damn\nThursday. Sin also gaped. Little Mac,\nsince when did you become so formidable?\nTranmax simply replied calmly. We'll\ntalk about that later. Let's settle the\nmatter at hand first. Guard Tam\nstruggled to stand up, gritting his\nteeth and grunting. No matter how\nformidable you are, you can't fight the\nKim family. I advise you to stop\nmeddling. Tranmack turned his head\nslowly, saying, \"Perhaps in your eyes,\nthe Kim family is unreachable. But in my\neyes, the Kim family is just a bunch of\nmortals. Suddenly, a voice rang out from\nbehind the crowd. Who dares to discuss\nmy Kim family behind our backs?\nHoan vi immediately bowed his head,\nwhispering, \"Elest young master Kim.\"\nKimuan gritted his teeth, coldly\nordering, \"Daring to look down on my Kim\nfamily, arrest him for me.\" A group of\nsubordinates rushed forward. But in just\na few seconds, all of them were sent\nflying by Tranmack like piles of trash.\nHuh? Footsteps were heard outside the\nmain door again. The current patriarch\nKim Chong Wan and his son Kim Chin Hoa\nappeared. Kim Kuan was startled, calling\nout loudly. Grandpa, dad. He pointed at\nTramac and screamed, \"Dad, this brat.\"\nKim Chong Nuan, cut him off. Voice\nstern. Kim Chong Nuan has failed to\nteach his descendants strictly,\nspecifically coming to apologize to Mr.\nTran. This sentence was like a\nthunderclap in a clear sky. Everyone\npresent was stunned. What ning?\nStammering. Could it be? You are\ngrandmaster tran. Tranmack looked at him\nsmirking. Elder Kim previously my friend\nam Thursday and was kicked out and\nverbally humiliated. It was done by this\neldest young master Kima.\nKim Kuan Nin trembled and knelled on the\nground with a thud, begging Mr. Tran. It\nwas I who had eyes but failed to see\nMount Tai. Please, Mr. Tran, punish me.\nTranmack didn't bother looking at him,\nturning to his friend, his gaze calm but\nstern. Thursday sin, how he treated you\nbefore, you treat him the same way now,\nhe added, his tone like a verdict. Don't\nworry, if he dares to take revenge on\nyou in the future, I guarantee he will\nuse his life to regret it.\nEarly explaining, Mr. Tran, I didn't\nknow he was your friend. Otherwise, I\nwould absolutely never dare to treat him\nlike that. Damn. Thursday Sin walked to\nTranm's side, whispering, \"Little Mac,\nlet it go. It's all in the past.\" Tranm\ndidn't reply. His cold gaze shifting to\nKim Chunan, his steady voice ringing\nout. Elder Kim, this is a warning. My\nfriend doesn't want to act. I hope you\ndon't disappoint me. Kim Chong Nuan\nbowed slightly. A rare respectful\nattitude. Grandmaster Tran, rest\nassured. This old man will definitely\ngive you a satisfactory answer. He\nturned to his son, tone suddenly\nbecoming stern. Chinhoa, he is your son.\nYou use the family law to execute the\npunishment. Ground him. Kim Kuan was\nimmediately scared to death, his voice\ntrembling as he begged. Grandpa, don't.\nDad. Dad, save me. Don't. Kim Shinhoa\njust shook his head silently, hand\ngrasping the family law instrument as if\ngrasping disappointment. If you want to\nblame someone, blame yourself. Arrogant\nand conceited, blind as a bat. Crack.\nThe sound of the family law whip\nstriking down made everyone startle. Kim\nKuanin let out a miserable scream. Ah.\nThe surroundings were silent as the\ngrave. Many people stared wideeyed,\nsecretly terrified. Grounding meant\nbreaking both legs. Therefore, for great\nfamilies to stand firm in the world,\nstrict and cruel family rules are\nindispensable. Kim Chong Wan turned to\nTran Mack, his face serious. Grandmaster\nTR, is this acceptable to you? Tranmack\ncasually wave his hand. There won't be a\nnext time. Kim Chun Wuan nodded, bowing\nbefore leaving. Then I asked for\npermission to take this unfil grandson\nback. Hoanvi stood aside, muttering. The\ngreat tree of the Kim family. Yet they\nare so respectful to this brat. Hokim\nHoa gritted his teeth, his eyes sharp as\nknives. Tranmack, what exactly is his\nbackground? At this moment, Dam Kuang\nHoy stepped forward, saying emotionally,\n\"Tran, Mr. Tran, thank you for stepping\nin to save us.\" Tran Mack hurriedly\nsupported him, his tone becoming gentle\nagain. \"Uncle Dam, don't be so polite.\"\nBased on a relationship between me and\nThursday sin, \"The damn family's\nbusiness is also my business.\" Having\nsaid that, he turned around gently\nwaving his hand, walking towards the\ndoor. \"All right, I have to go too\ngood.\" Damn. Kuang Hoy watches\nretreating figure. His eyes shining.\nSon, your luck is truly good. Making\nsuch a good friend. Zaming stoent.\nHis eyes following that back. Mixed\nfeelings in his heart. Like this. From\nnow on, we are no longer people of the\nsame world. At the same time, at a\nremote villa, a pitch black car parked\nat the gate. Undeep and lowered his\nvoice asking, \"Big brother, is it time\nyet?\" Unzong of the insect nodded\ncoldly. Yeah, put that thing on the car.\nLeave immediately. But right at this\nmoment, a cold voice rang out from\nbehind. Want to leave? A figure in\nyellow stepped out from the darkness. It\nwas Lean Tanak of the spirit sect\nimmediately clench his fists. Lean\nTanak. Did you come to rob the ean\nmaiden of my insect? Locket.\nThis is clearly the spirit maiden of my\nspirit sect. Undeep in was furious. His\nwhole body's cultivation base erupting.\nWant to rob people? We'll fight you to\nthe death. Lang my phi eyes scornful.\nThe body refining weapons of the insect\nare not worth mentioning. Nepunim\nwatched this scene silently. A wave of\ncontempt rising in her heart. These\npeople all treat her as a gift to be\ngiven to others. It would be best if\nthey all died. Un Zhong stepped forward\nshouting. Lean Tanak. She was discovered\nby our family first. She is the Endaiden\nof the Ensect. You cannot take her away.\nLean Tan Knock stood on high, his voice\nthundering. For the sake of being from\nthe same Enspirit sect lineage, I will\nspare your lives. But if you dare to\ntake my spirit maiden away, don't blame\nme for being ruthless. Not far away,\nTranmack and Tran Tongue Too were\nsecretly observing. He muttered to\nhimself, \"Ein spirit sect isn't an\nimmortal cultivation sect stretching\nfrom ancient times. Why would they have\na treasure that I need?\" Tranmack\nquickly entered the place. That guy\nnamed Lean Tanak saw this frowning and\nasking, \"Who are you?\" Nepunim exclaimed\nworriedly, \"Tran Mack, why are you here?\nRun quickly.\" Tranmack looked cold,\nfearless, speaking decisively. \"Let her\ngo. Tell your young sem to come see me.\"\nLean Knock realized something through\nTransmac's words. \"What? You're a\nmartial artist?\" He frantically ordered\nthe giant stone monster to attack. Stomp\nhim to death. Tranmack calmly and\nconfidently issued a command causing the\nstone monster's foot to freeze in midair\nforbidden. Not only that, the stone\nmonster's entire body completely\ncontrolled by his magic array. Huge\ncracks appeared on its body. Just a few\nseconds later, it crumbled, losing its\nvitality. Lean Tanak was extremely\nastonished by Tranmax ability. Not\nexpecting him to be able to disperse the\nspiritual power he controlled. What was\ngoing on? Unable to deal with him, Lean\nTanak rushed forward, wanting to grab\nQunim. Come with me. She screamed in\nfear. Tong too didn't even need to act\npersonally. Tranmax stood aside,\nordering the flying sword to slash down.\nIn the blink of an eye, Lean Tanak's\nhead was severed from his neck. Tunim\nwitnessed the whole scene, eyes wide, a\nbit terrified. Tramac walked closer and\nasked, \"Scared?\" She breathed a sigh of\nrelief. \"No, I feel very refreshed in my\nheart. His death isn't enough to atone\nfor his crimes. The remaining people all\ntrembled and knelt down, begging,\n\"Don't. Don't kill me. We are willing to\nsubmit.\" Tramax's expression was\nextremely serious. Backing them into a\ncorner. I ask you, answer. If you're not\nhonest, you know the consequences. They\nimmediately obeyed. Yes. Yes. We\nabsolutely dare not hide a single word.\nThe truth was revealed. It turned out\nthat the Inspirits sect was founded 200\nyears ago by a scholar weary of the\nworld who accidentally obtained a\ncultivation manual, not some ancient\nimmortal cultivation sect. These people\nhave always been fighting internally\nnon-stop. Currently, the internal\nconflict is serious. Having split into\nthe insect and spirit sect, each\ngoverned by a young sect master. Cunim\nis a very special girl. She was born in\na in year in month and in hour recorded\nas a pure in maiden in the classics of\nthe inspirit sect. The young family and\nlean family both want to offer her to\ntheir young sect master. He continued to\ninterrogate. Then what about the demon's\nseed? Unknown who planted it, but this\ntime it touched their blind spot of\nknowledge. Was a demon seed? Don't know.\nReally don't know. Trax silently judged.\nIt seems they don't know the inside\nstory either. After that, Tramac gave\nthem two spirit pills. Eat it, then\nleave me to find your young sect\nmaster.\" The two stared wideeyed, saying\nin surprise, \"Top rate spirit pills.\"\nTranmax sternly warned, \"I can grant you\npills. I can also kill you with a casual\nhand.\" \"Understood.\" They all obediently\nlistened. \"We understand. Thank you,\nsenior.\" A moment later, Unzich took\nthem to the foot of a cliff. This place\nis Dong Kin Mountain, which is where the\nmountain gate of the inspirit sect is\nlocated. Standing here, Tranax silently\nsensed. This Dongkin Mountain contains\nrich spiritual energy within it also\nhides a trace of ominous aura. Tranmax\nsharp eyes quickly identified the\nproblem. This Dongkin Mountain has a\nsecret. Cannot waste time. Tranmax\nstrode forward, ordering to go up the\nmountain. Looking around on all four\nsides, a huge iron chain could be seen.\nThe air was also extremely desolate\nwithout a single trace of vitality. Unzi\nHung walked ahead leading the way for\neveryone. After walking a long distance,\nTranmac looked ahead casually. Unzi Hung\npointed to a large cave and said, \"This\nplace is Kuang Chu Peak.\" Continuing\nforward is the main gate of the in\nspirit sect. Walking there, the\natmosphere became even more deadly.\nAlthough there were trees and bushes,\nTranmack quickly and accurately sensed\nthat while the spiritual energy here was\nabundant, the ominous killing aura was\nalso becoming increasingly dense.\nFeeling a bit afraid, Tunim held on a\nTranmax arm. Is it the ominous killing\naura? No wonder I feel so uncomfortable\nright now. Really want to lose my\ntemper. Suddenly, Tranac took her hand\nand transferred internal energy to her.\nTranmack turned his head and smiled at\nher. That should make you feel better,\nright? Tunin was extremely grateful.\nThank you so much. Unzi Hung gave a\nsimple introduction of what lay ahead.\nThat is the mountain gate of the inspir\nsect. Getting a bit closer, they could\nsee a cave on a cliff. He honestly\nconfessed, \"Senior, although we are also\nmembers of the Inan Spirit sect, we are\nonly responsible for collecting\ncultivation resources in the secular\nworld. We only came to this mountain\ngate area once when we joined the sect\nover 10 years ago. So, I don't know if\nthere are any traps or mechanisms.\nTranmack didn't care much about this\nissue. It's fine regardless of what\nmechanism or formation it is. I can\neasily break it. Afterward, they walked\ntogether towards the inspirit sex\nmountain gate. Suddenly, several men in\nblack jumped out. Who are you? Tranmack\nreplied calmly. Shocking young Zitch\nhung on the spot. I'm here to collect a\ndebt from your imbecile young sect\nmaster. Two men in black rushed forward\nfuriously, threatening, \"What? How dare\nyou be disrespectful to our young\nsemaster? Dealing with these people,\nTranmack simply reached out his hand\ngently and his hand immediately\ntransformed into a gigantic shape. The\ntwo men took the full brunt of Tranmax\nstrike, instantly falling to the ground\nand vomiting blood. One of them stood\nout and loudly questioned who Tran Mack\nactually was. Tranmack couldn't be\nbothered to answer, only saying coldly,\n\"Call that piece of trash out here to\nsee me.\" From the cave entrance, many\nmen in black poured out, instantly\nsurrounding everyone. Beneath their feet\nwas the ean ferocious chain formation. A\nscornful voice came from inside the\ncave. Want to see me? Pass their test\nfirst. Unzi Hung looked worried and\nhurly warned. Senior. This in ferocious\nchain formation is the insect strongest\narray specifically used to deal with\npowerful enemies. The young sect master\nwas hiding in a corner, ordering the\nminions under his command. Keep that\ngirl. Kill all the rest. They rushed\ntowards Tranmack together. Give up your\nlives. Tongue Tu saw Tranmac being\nbesieged and cried out an alarm. Master,\nthe formation was activated and a\npowerful light suddenly flashed. Tongue\nTwo blocked in front, protecting\nTranmack from danger, his whole body\nbecoming completely paralyzed as a\nresult. Tongue Two glared furiously.\nDamn it, I was actually pushed back by a\ndozen minions. Tramac opened his mouth\nto advise this great array can use\nspiritual power as a guide to block your\nattacks. Don't waste any more time. Let\nme tongue too bowed his head in apology.\nIt is this disciple whose skills are not\nrefined. Tranmack instructed as he\nwalked. I don't blame you. Although your\nstrength has entered the transformation\nrealm, you still cannot compare to it.\nLearn slowly. The young sect master\ninside the cave deliberately provoked\nagain bluffing. If you have the skill,\ntry breaking my great array. Tramac said\nno more. He clenched his fist and\nunleashed a move. Heavenly mysterious\ndivine fist, third form. A punch of\nunparalleled power was brought down by\nhim, shaking the universe. A large area\nof earth and rocks was affected by this\npunch. The power pouring down,\ndestroying everything. Those minions,\nunable to resist, were turned to ashes.\nUnzich and deep in were terrified,\nunable to believe their eyes. What kind\nof power is this? Is this even human?\nEven Tunimin was so astonished she\ncouldn't close her mouth. Tramac\nactually possessed such powerful\nabilities. The young sect master\ncontinued to scream, \"Brat, you harm my\ninsect members. Today I will take your\nlife to avenge the disciples.\" Tranmax's\ngaze focused and he said decisively just\nbased on that sentence, \"It is enough\nfor me to wipe out your ean spirit\nsect.\" In his past life at this time,\nTranmack was forced to kneel and\nsuffered all kinds of humiliation. What\nhe regretted most in his past life was\nhis family and friends meeting miserable\nmisfortunes. Therefore, at this moment,\nthe will in Tranmax's heart burned like\nnever before. Reborn this time, I must\nprotect them well and make up for the\nregrets of my past life. Qunim felt\nsurprised by Tranmack's attitude.\nTranmac is angry. Even tongue too felt\nthe same. He is truly angry. Inside the\ncave was a gloomy and scary place. The\nfour of them followed Tramac deep\ninside. After walking a long way,\nTranmac and Un Zung both looked ahead at\nthe same time. Sitting on a wooden bed\nin front of them was the young sect\nmaster, fat as a pig. He sneered,\nlooking at Tranmack with a scornful\ngaze. Wait until I kill you. I will use\na secret technique to dual cultivate\nwith the ean female. My strength will be\nable to surpass the sect master and by\nthen this entire en spirit sect will be\nmine. This statement made both Tran Mack\nand Tunim furious. Disgusting. Do you\nthink that relying on the ominous\nkilling aura here will allow you to kill\nme? The smile on his face instantly\nvanished. You actually know about the\nominous killing aura. Brat, what is your\nbackground? Tranmack questioned coldly.\nYou don't need to know. I ask you, the\ndemon seed on Tunim was a planted by\nyou. He pretended not to understand.\nDemon seed? Hearing this, Tran Mack\nclosed his eyes, feeling regretful. It\nseems it wasn't you. Tran Mack suddenly\nreleased a flying sword, cutting off one\nof the opponent's arms, and you can go\ndie. However, what surprised him was\nthat the opponent's arm was slowly\nrecovering like a ghost. Your arm can\nrecover on its own. Tranmack judged. Did\nyou cultivate a Dao body? No, it's not a\nDao body. The young sect master mocked\nand provoked triumphantly. Brat, know my\npower now? You can't kill me. Obediently\nsubmit to me, hand over the secrets on\nyou, and I might spare you from death.\nTranmack completely ignored his words,\nreleasing the flying sword again. But\nthis time, he had prepared a sturdy\nshield in time, preventing the flying\nsword from reaching him. Philu,\na glint of extreme danger flashed in\nTranmax's eyes. What kind of ominous\nkilling aura is this that can actually\nblock my heavens slashing sword? The\nflying sword didn't attack the young\nsect master, but flew straight into the\nwall. When she saw what was behind the\nwall, Tunim exclaimed in horror, \"Oh my\ngod, it's full of white bones there. It\nwas done by the young semaster. This was\nthe source of the ominous killing aura.\"\nA look of surprise appeared on his face\nupon being discovered. Beside these dry\nbones were guns and military uniforms.\nThis was an army. He suddenly stood up.\nadmitting with a cruel look in his eyes,\n\"That's right. Only these soldiers with\nstrong will, rich in self-sacrifice,\nunyielding and loyal, can release so\nmuch ominous killing aura after death.\"\nBut Chunim remembered a news report. I\nheard that years ago an army of over\n10,000 men went to the front lines, then\nwent missing and were determined to have\nsacrificed heroically for the country.\nIt turns out their remains are here.\nTranmax's face darkened as he said. They\ncouldn't step onto the battlefield, but\nbecame vengeful spirits instead, which\ngave birth to such intense, ominous\nkilling aura. However, that young sect\nmaster still stubbornly said with\ndisdain, \"These strong willed people\nwere useless alive. Dying fulfills my\npurpose, it's just a pity that too few\ndied. Otherwise, my ferocious aura,\nbody, temper, and divine art could have\nbeen cultivated to the highest level.\"\nTranmax anger reached its peak. \"You\ndeserve to die.\" The young sect master\npuckered his pig-like mouth, took a deep\nbreath, and his body instantly became\ngigantic. He arrogantly declared, \"I\nadmit you are a bit tricky, but with\nthis intense, ominous killing aura, I am\nan invincible existence.\" Tranmac was\nserious like never before. He recalled\nthe flying sword and replied,\n\"Invincible? In front of me? You are not\neven equal to an ant.\" He raised his\nhand and chanted to activate samadei.\nTrue fire activate array. In an instant,\na giant flame burned fiercely\nsurrounding him. He laughed\ntriumphantly. \"Huh? My body is\nimpervious to water and fire. Do you\nthink you could defeat me with these\nchildish tricks? Keep dreaming.\" As soon\nas he finished speaking, a piece of\nflesh on his arm was burnt, turning into\nroasted pork. He started sweating\nprofusely, his eyes widening in shock.\n\"What's happening? This fire can\nactually hurt me?\" He struggled in pain\nwithin the fire, screaming for mercy.\n\"What fire is this? Why can't I put out?\nUh, it hurts. Spare me. Spare me. I was\nwrong. Tran Mack couldn't contain his\nanger, glaring at him and saying, \"Look\nat the remains of the heroic spirits\nbehind you. Who can save you?\" His\nscreams grew louder and louder. I was\nwrong. Great masters spare my life. I\nknow I was wrong. Finally running out of\noptions, he called out to the semaster\nfor help. Seek master, save me. After\nthe fire gradually died down, a piece of\nspirit wood was revealed. Tranmack\nquickly recognized it as innate spirit\nwood. He picked it up secretly rejoicing\nin his heart. This is a top tier\nmaterial for refining pills and magical\ntools. With it I can cultivate the wood\nelement body and the primordial\nindestructible body. Suddenly an\nunfamiliar foot appeared behind the\nthree of them. Qunim and tongue too\nturned around at the same time. The sect\nmaster had appeared. He opened his mouth\nand said, \"Leave my cauldron behind and\nyou may leave as you please.\" Tramac\nlooked straight at him and asked, \"You\nare the sect master of the ean spirit\nsect, the demon seed on my friend, was\nit planted by you?\" Not only was he not\nashamed, but he also sneered, \"To be\nable to serve as my cauldron and witness\nme achieving the great Dao is her\nhonor.\" Tran Mack retorted coldly. Then\nbeing hacked to death by me is also your\nhonor. Hearing this sentence, he laughed\nloudly, his laughter echoing throughout\nthe cave. Ha! Dense demonic energy\npoured out from around him as he glared\nscornfully. My jade planting art has\nbeen cultivated to the realm of Ingyong\nharmony. Once I absorb the demon's seed\nin her body, I could become the first\ndivine realm expert in nearly a hundred\nyears. You think you can kill me just by\nyourself? Tranmack quickly urged his\ninternal energy, replying, it's just a\nmatter of spending a bit more effort.\nWhy can't I kill you? The sect master\nsneered. Is that so? He rushed forward\nmadly. Then let me see what skills you\nhave. Tune in and tongue were astonished\nby his speed. They couldn't even see his\nmovements clearly. His cultivation was\ntoo terrifying. Tramac didn't even need\nto use a magical tool. He clenched his\nfist. Useless move. He landed a punch on\nthe opponent, breaking his attack and\nsending him flying. He gritted his teeth\nin hatred. What exactly is your\nbackground? Tran Mack said disdainfully,\n\"The dead don't need to know.\" As soon\nas he finished speaking, Tranmack bent\ndown and unleashed a move. Heavenly\nmysterious divine fist, first form,\nmountain-breaking weapon. The sect\nmaster also quickly kept up in ominous\nbody protection. Heaven's severing hand.\nTwo forces collided head-on, creating\nterrifying aftershocks. Tranmac\nunleashed moves continuously while\npraising him. You're actually not dead\nyet. Just in time for me to practice my\nhand. The sect master raised a fist\noverflowing with demonic energy,\naffirming, \"If I don't send you on your\nway today, I swear I'm not human.\" He\npointed his fingertip at Trramac. Just a\nsecond later, he released power,\nsubmerging the entire cave in his\ndemonic ice. Ice seals the world. Frost\nand fierce wind surged violently. His\nlegs were gradually freezing. Zitch Hung\nwas extremely worried. What is this?\nKunim also started to panic. What do we\ndo? Are we all going to be frozen?\nTongue Tu resiliently used fist energy\nto shatter the ice fragments trying to\nattack him. The ice surface had spread\nto Tranmax's knees, but he stood\nmotionless. Tongue Tu became\nincreasingly panicked. No good. This\nlayer of ice is still spreading. The\nsect master stood aside, proclaiming\nproudly, \"You are very strong, but still\nnot enough to resist my magic.\" Tranmac\nshouted, \"You dare call this little\nskill magic?\" Arrogantly, not wasting\nany more time. Tranmack seriously\nchanneled his energy. Watch my ice seals\nthe world. Tranmack's cultivation method\nquickly condensed into giant blocks of\nice, then gradually spread, surrounding\nand controlling that sect master,\nshocking him to the extreme. How is this\npossible? He was scared until his face\nturned purple, but still refused to\nadmit the opponent's strength. Why is\nyour magic so strong? This is\nimpossible. He suddenly played his final\ntrump card, which was the grand sect\nguarding formation. Since it's come to\nthis, a look of worry appeared in\nTranmack's eyes. Not good. Tranmack\nhurriedly turned around to urge\neveryone. Go quickly. However, he had\nalready activated the formation. Too\nlate. The demonic energy hidden in the\nformation surged violently. Tramac\ncouldn't cope for a moment. His whole\nbody was frozen, but he still stubbornly\nthreatened. Today, I will use the inspir\ngrand sect guarding formation to perish\ntogether with you. Having finished\nspeaking, he and the formation exploded,\nreleasing dense demonic energy. Looking\nfrom the outside, this mountain was\nalmost about to be destroyed. The young\nsect master of the spirit sect stood\noutside watching, then calmly evaluated.\nThe sect master actually self-destructed\nthe grand sect guarding formation. It\nseems that Brat's strength far exceeded\nimagination. Luckily, I was always\nhiding in the dark, watching, not\nrushing to act, otherwise I would have\nbeen buried in there, too. He smiled\nmaliciously, having developed the\nintention to monopolize. He saying so\nmeans the inspirit sect is mine. I'll go\nreorganize the forces first, then\ndestroy everything belonging to this\nbrat. Also considering it as revenge for\nthe sect master. A moment later, the\ncave completely collapsed under the\ndebris. Someone was struggling hard to\ncrawl up. Tongue too used all his\nstrength to push the rock away,\npainfully crawling to the ground, his\nwhole body heavily injured. Everyone can\nstill be saved. He resiliently ran to\nTranmax side. Master, how are you? Zach\nChung and Deep In were unconscious.\nTranmax whole body trembled because he\nhad protected everyone. He hurriedly\nordered Tongu. Tunim just fainted. Help\nme find a safe cave and guard me. I need\nto enter seclusion to heal immediately.\nTongue Tu bowed respectfully and said,\n\"Yes.\" Disciple thanks master for\nsacrificing himself to protect us. Time\nflew fast. In the blink of an eye, half\na month passed. During this time, Tran\nMack was always calming his mind in\nseclusion to heal. Tunim was full of\nworry, asking Tongue Tu when Tran Mack\nwould wake up. He was also helpless. I\nhave never seen Master injured so\nheavily before. I don't know either. The\natmosphere in the suburbs of Fuang,\nDuong looked quite peaceful. This place\nwas also the hideout of the spirit sex\nyoung sect master. He walked into the\nroom with a dangerous look. Two beauties\ndon't be afraid. Actually, force is also\na kind of fun. I will embrace you\nproperly later. The two girls were\nkidnapped by him and were tied tightly\non the bed. In the forest, Tranmack woke\nup. He opened his mouth to ask Tong Two,\n\"How many days has it been?\" Cunim saw\nthis and was extremely happy. Tran Mack,\nyou're awake. Tongue Tu replied,\n\"Master, it's been half a month.\" At\nthis moment, Tramac was completely awake\nand recovered. Thanks to the three-leaf\nred fruit and spirit wood, not only were\nhis injuries healed in a short time, but\nhis cultivation also broke through.\nSuddenly, he felt the jade bracelet he\ngave to Quinton break. His eyes became\nextremely worried because of this.\nSomething happened to Quinton. Tranmack\nrushed away at the speed of light, not\nforgetting to leave a message. You take\nback. I have urgent business and must go\nfirst. Just as he sensed, the protective\nJ bracelet had now shattered into\npieces. The spirit sex young sect master\nwas startled by the jade bracelet and\ntook a step back. Oh, I didn't expect a\nnormal person to have such a powerful\nprotective magical treasure. Quinton\nonly understood now. No wonder Tramac\ninsisted she wore the jade bracelet. It\nactually held off this rogue for half an\nhour. The spirit sex young sect master\nsmiled sinisterly. But I see now no one\ncan come to save you.\nBut he easily controlled her. He little\nbeauty don't rush one by one. He played\na dirty trick pressing on Tin down.\nStarting with you first. Don't be\nafraid. It will be very fun. On Tin was\nextremely scared. She struggled\nceaselessly. Her mouth gagged, unable to\ncall for help. MMP MPH. Just then, a\nsurprise attack struck. The spirit sect\nyoung sect master reacted quickly,\ndodging backwards. He frowned in\nannoyance. Who dares to sneak attack\nthis old man? When he saw the person in\nfront of him, his eyes immediately went\ndull. Tranmack's appearance scared him\ninto tucking his tail, stuttering\nspeechless. \"It's you. You aren't.\" The\ntwo girls felt much more at ease seeing\nTranmack appear. His eyes had never been\nso dangerous. I will make you disappear\ncompletely from this world. The spirit\nsects young sect master regained his\ncomposure, even smiling coldly in\ntriumph. Hero saving the beauty. You\nbrat. The words weren't finished when\nTran sword swung out, slashing straight\ninto the opponent's shoulder. Tranmack\ncoldly uttered a familiar sentence. Shut\nup. Dead people don't need to talk.\nTranmax sword moves were endless, making\nthe opponent unable to block in time. In\nintense pain, he squeezed out a few\nwords. Spare. Spare. A light flashed,\ngradually swallowing him. Finally, only\na lingering sound was heard. Spare.\nSpare my life. Tranmack stepped forward\ngently helping on Tin up. Sister Onin, I\nlet you suffer. On Tin, because she was\ntoo scared, hugged Tran Mack tightly,\ncrying silently. Tranmack didn't know\nhow to comfort her for a moment. Quinton\nquietly watched the two of them. Then\nTramac took a step back, comforting both\nsister on. Quinton, don't be sad\nanymore. A serious look appeared on\nTranmax's face. Watch me help you too\nvent your anger. At the spirit's sect\nbase, disciples began to rush out in\nchaos. They didn't know the immensity of\nheaven and earth blocking away. Stand\nstill. Tramac was too lazy to talk.\nQuietly riding his sword forward. One of\nthe disciples took a full sword hit,\nunable to utter half a word. You this is\nthe entire base sounded the alarm. Enemy\nattack. Enemy attack. When the three of\nthem arrived at the outer courtyard,\nhundreds of spirit sect disciples had\nsurrounded them. They roared threats\nfrantically. Who are you? I warn you.\nThis is the inspirit sex territory. Our\ninspirit sect isn't a place you can mess\nwith. Tramac felt extremely annoyed. You\nguys are too noisy. Tramac clenched his\nfist, unleashing a move. Heavenly\nmysterious divine fist, third form. The\nattack struck like thunder, defeating\nhundreds of minions. The two girls\nwitnessed this scene. Hard to hide their\nastonishment. As for Tranmac, this was\nalready too familiar. Very quickly, it\nbecame completely dark. Everyone in the\nhouse was both happy and scared. Tramac\nis back. Did he save the two of them?\nTang Tang saw Quinton, ran over to hug\nher, and cried loudly, blaming herself.\nMiss, it was me being useless, unable to\nprotect you. Quinton gently comforted\nthe girl. It's okay now. Don't cry\nanymore. You did very well. Tramax's\nfather was both confused and curious. So\nwere the kidnappers. They threatened us\nnot to call the police, saying it was\nuseless. How did you save the two of\nthem? Trax's face darkened, saying, \"No\nneed to worry anymore. They're all\ndead.\" Trax's mother was even more\ncurious. \"All dead? Who did it?\" Tr.\nThe flame of anger in his heart suddenly\nflared up again. \"I only regret not\nhitting hard enough. Killing enough\nmeans no one will dare touch my Tranmax,\nfamily, and friends anymore.\" A\nterrifying determination flashed in his\neyes. I won't let everyone know what in\nawaits those who touch my Tranmax family\nand friends. His father was stunned\nmomentarily not knowing what to say.\nLittle Mac. At this moment, Tran Mac\nrestored his normal gaze. Then he made\nup an extremely absurd reason. Ah, it\nwas all tongue too. He taught me the\nstyle of doing big things. That's right.\nIt was tongue Tuesday. Tongue two. Being\nnamed suddenly sneezed continuously. A\nmoment later, Tramac took out three\nsmall jade pendants, instructing, \"Dad,\non tin, Quinton, each of you take one.\nWe're on your person.\" His father\nglanced at it, blurting out, \"Oh my,\nwhat is this thing for? A piece charm?\"\nHis mother heard this, angrily\nreminding, \"If you're told to wear it,\njust wear it.\" He was afraid of his\nwife, immediately obeying. Wearing,\nwearing, definitely wearing. In the\nsmall courtyard inside Tang City,\neverything remained as it was. At this\ntime, Quinton was kneeling in front of\nTranmack. wanted to bow to Tranmack as\nher master. A moment later, Tranmac made\na decision. Stand up. I agree to accept\nyou as a disciple. Tongue Tu stood\naside, suddenly startled by Tranm's\nwords. From today onwards, Tongue Tu is\nyour eldest senior brother. Quinton\nhappily stood up. Thank you, master.\nThen she stepped forward, respectfully,\nbowing to Tongu, senior brother. He\nawkwardly helped her up. Junior sister,\nno need to be formal. In his heart, he\nsilently shipped them. Who knows, maybe\none day Junior's sister will become the\nmaster's wife. I absolutely cannot be\nrude. Tranmac was thinking about how to\nplan her cultivation. What technique\nshould I teach Quinton now? 3 days\nlater, Quinton focused on cultivating\nthe technique. Tang Tang felt quite\nsurprised at Quinton's change. Tranmack\nalso stood there observing, thinking to\nhimself, I gave her the method of the\njade pool sacred land to build the\nfoundation. Her progress is extremely\nfast. Within 3 days, she has reached.\nTramac also realized the abnormality.\nHowever, her cultivation speed is\nabnormally fast. There might be\nsomething wrong. Then, Tranmack placed\nhis hand on Quinton's forehead to check.\nSuddenly, a surge of Phoenix power\nradiated from her body. Tang Tang truly\ncouldn't believe her eyes, exclaiming,\n\"What is this?\" Tranmack took just one\nglance and recognized it accurately. So,\nthat's it. She actually possesses the\nheavenly phoenix bloodline. Tang Tang\nasked in confusion, \"What is the\nheavenly phoenix bloodline? Is my lady\nin danger?\" Trani replied, \"No, this is\nan excellent constitution for\ncultivation.\" Tran smiled at her,\npromising silently in his heart. When I\nleave this planet, I will guide you on\nthe path of immortality cultivation\ntowards eternal life. In the evening,\neveryone arrived at the school's\nfounding anniversary celebration hall.\nTrue Kuang squeezed through the crowded\nmass, waving his hand. Tran Mack, over\nhere. When Tran Mack walked over, he\nasked curiously, \"Why did you come so\nlate?\" The celebration is already\nhalfway through. Tranmack replied,\n\"Aren't I here now?\" The host happily\nintroduced. Next, please welcome Emo\nDong, Yani from class 3, and Hoen Gofong\nfrom class 5. Just hearing these two\nnames, the audience below the stage\nscrambled to scream. Finally, my goddess\nof mong yin ni is on stage\nmibang. The stage lights gradually\nshifted to dreamlike colors accompanying\na piano. Hoen Fong played in grossly\nwhile Yini dressed in ancient costume\ndanced gracefully to the melodious tune.\nAll the boys below the stage were\nmesmerized by her beauty. Yini's\ncountenance was truly rare in this\nworld, her eyes beautiful like a\nthousand stars. Tranmack couldn't help\nbut smile. Being able to see her dance\nagain, it's really good. The performance\nended and the two bowed to the audience\ntogether. Everyone shouted loudly. So\nbeautiful. Yin and he. Yen and he. Yen\nand he. Tranmack had already made a\ndecision in his heart. Since I killed\nthe golden crocodile at Linvu Mountain,\nI haven't met her again. Not meeting now\nwill save some trouble. Trax stood up\nand said to True Kuang, \"I'm going to\nthe restroom for a bit.\" Just as Tramax\nstood up, Yiani recognized him. Tramac.\nShe didn't say anything more, leaving\nthe stage and running down. Zuenly, Yini\nexcitedly hugged Tramac tightly. I\nthought I would never see you again.\nEveryone was so shocked they couldn't\nclose their mouths. Isn't Mo Dong Yini\nthe cold and arrogant goddess? Where's\nthe arrogance? Where's the hottiness?\nThe goddess has thrown herself into\nsomeone else's arms. It's heartbreaking.\nTangio also didn't expect Yan Ni to do\nsuch a thing. She's really bold and Kat\nDiet silently assessed. Is there\nsomething wrong with Yiani's head? To\nactually like someone like him? Tranmack\ngently comforted her. All right. Aren't\nI standing right here? She calmed down\nand asked, \"Right, why couldn't I get\nthrough to your phone?\" Tranmack\nimmediately replied, \"That's right. But\nI've saved your number. I'll take the\ninitiative to add you on WeChat.\"\nYianise smiled and agreed. Okay, then\nI'll wait for your message. By the time\nthe celebration ended, it was already\nlate at night. After walking a distance,\nTranmack realized someone was following\nhim and spoke coldly. Why are you\nfollowing me? It turned out to be caught\nduet coming to chase him away from Yini.\nI don't know what method you used to\ndeceive Yini, but stay away from her.\nYou are fundamentally unworthy of her.\nTramax face showed some displeasure as\nhe questioned. Is that so? Then tell me,\nin what way am I unworthy of her? And\nKad Duette couldn't state a specific\nreason, so she could only repeat\nbaseless words. I know you are very good\nat fighting and have some connections\nand in the future you might take over\nyour mother's company but even so you\nare not worthy of Yi Tran Mack laughed\nloudly responded her absurd words haha\nand Kadette you are truly foolish the\nbackground and status you care about are\nnot worth a penny in my eyes hearing\nthese words and Kadette turned pale\nstunned wealth and status in your eyes\nare just garbage to me Tranm frowned\nangrily emphasizing for her to\nunderstand don't Use your short-sighted\ngaze to judge me. Tramac said while\nturning to leave. Do you think the\nvalues of mortals and gods are the same?\nRidiculous. And Cod Deette was still\nfull of disgust. Still won't be a god.\nThere will be a day you regret\npretending like this. Very quickly, it\nwas 3:00 in the afternoon the next day\nat the Van Tuang Hotel. Kim Boy Van\nwalked up to Tranmack and said, \"Master\nTran, I heard that this charity auction\nwill have a magical artifact. I believe\nyou'll be interested.\" Hm. After seeing\nthe artifact, I will leave. Many people\nhad already arrived at the auction.\nToday, the others also arrived. Trentu\nand Duong TNT looked around excitedly.\nWow. Thanks to brotherh, we could come\nhere to broaden our horizons. This hall\nis really high class. Duong TNT looked\nahead startled in surprise. Look, isn't\nthat Tramac? Why is he here, too? The\nperson named Brother House saw this and\nfrowned unhappily. Why did he appear\nhere? Could he be relying on those few\nacquaintances of his? Yiani appeared,\nwalked over, and asked him, \"Oh, you're\nhere, too?\" But her eyes immediately lit\nup when she saw Tran Mack. Yani smiled\nand called out, \"Tran Mack, you're here,\ntoo.\" Tramac stood up and answered her.\nA friend invited me to see some things.\nDo you want to sit with me? At this\nmoment, another big shot appeared, his\nface looking unhappy. Look, isn't that\ndeep TN? Didn't DeepTen Nin go to\nmilitary school? Why is he suddenly\nback? Duong tien explained. Don't you\nknow? Young Master Deep joined a main\nspecial forces unit. Now he's back to\nvisit home. As for Trent Tulu, she\ncouldn't be happy. Young Master Deep is\nback. Someone's going to be unlucky this\ntime. Deep. Tien Nin was frowning. But\nwhen he saw Yin Ni, his expression\nimmediately turned into joy, calling out\nloudly. Yin Ni seeing her standing next\nto another man, he immediately asked,\n\"Brat, who are you?\" Trentu Lu heardly\napproached to report. Young Master Deep,\nhe is Tranmack, the one Yin he actively\nhugged during the school anniversary. He\nwas extremely surprised by this news.\nWhat? He turned angry from embarrassment\nand shouted at Tramac. What kind of\nthing are you? You even dare to touch my\ndeep tien nin woman. Who gave you the\nguts? Yiani couldn't stand seeing him\nhumiliated and spoke up to question deep\ntien nin. I warn you not to act\nrecklessly. Since when did I become your\nwoman? Do you still have any shame? Tran\nMatt calmly and publicly mocked. Yi,\nlet's go over there. There's a dog\nbarking here. It's too noisy. Deep Tien\nNin gritted his teeth, unable to swallow\nthis anger, and criticized. You trash.\nDo you only know how to hide behind a\nwoman? Tranmax's face darkened, and he\nsneered, laughable. You don't even have\na woman willing to protect you, which\nproves you are even worse than trash,\nbeing spoken to like a dog. He clenched\nhis fist and rushed forward. You dare to\nhumiliate me like this? Do you want to\ndie? A gleam of extremely dangerous\nlight flashed in Tranmax's eyes. Scram.\nFacing that gaze, deep Ten Nin turned\npale, fear rising in his heart. Cold\nsweat broke out on his forehead as he\nthought. How is this possible? He\nclearly looks weak and frail. Why does\nhe have such a powerful and dangerous\naura? Tranmack turned around, too lazy\nto bicker with this kind of person. Yi,\nlet's go. Suddenly, he pulled out a gun\nand pointed it at Tranmack, causing him\nto stop in surprise. Everyone present\nwas dumbfounded. He has a gun. Something\nbig has happened. Yin Ni shouted angrily\nat him. Deep Tien Nin, are you crazy? He\nremained stubborn. I want to see if he\nis more powerful than a bullet. Tranmack\nfrowned slightly, thinking, \"As long as\nyou dare to fire, I will kill you\ndirectly.\" Daring to threaten me? Do\ncultivators not need face? At this\nmoment, Kim Boy Van also spoke up\nangrily. Deep ten nin put the gun away\nimmediately then get out knowing he had\nto weigh his options against Kim boy\nvan's power he stammered Kim Kim boy fun\nmy deep family is not equal to the Kim\nfamily I cannot offend her Kim boy van\ndeclared decisively Mr. Tran is a\ndistinguished guest I invited. If you\ndare point a gun at him, do you want\nyour deep family and my Kim Corporation\nto start an all-out war? People started\nbuzzing again. Kim Boy Van is actually\nmaking such a big deal out of this to\nthe point of letting two great wealthy\nfamilies go to allout war. What exactly\nis that kid's background? He became\nembarrassed. This Kim Boy van, out of\nrespect for you today, I will\ntemporarily let this brat off. Before\nleaving, he turned his head to glare at\nTranmack once more, saying fiercely, \"If\nyou dare pester Yiani again, I will\ndefinitely make your life a living\nhell.\" He huffed and shouted at the\npeople around him, \"Move!\" And Kadette\nand Duong Tinten stood behind, silently,\nassessing, \"Tranmac, the Kim family's\nbackground is ultimately not your own\nstrength.\" Once abandoned by the Kim\nfamily, \"You won't be worth a penny.\"\nKim boy van walked over and respectfully\ninvited him. Mr. Tran, please come sit\nin the VIP seat to the front. It turned\nout Tranmack had already seen through\nKimboy Van scheme. Tranmack glared and\nthreatened. Don't play these little\nsmart tricks in front of me in the\nfuture. If there's a next time, don't\nblame me for being unkind. Kimboy Van\nbowed in terror to admit her mistake.\nPlease forgive me, Mr. Tran. Kimboy Van\nrealized that she was actually\nprotecting Deep Tenin. Afterwards, Tran\nMack didn't want to pay attention to\nthese trivial matters anymore and left\nwith Yin Ni. Come, let's go to the\nfront. Okay. Just at this moment, her\nfather appeared and called out sternly,\n\"Yei, come here to father.\" Everyone was\nsurprised again. White horse Emote Dang,\nhe's here, too. This girl turns out to\nbe the daughter of Imo Dang. He is a\nhero of the southern border. Kimai,\nhello Mr. Mo. He instructed Miss Kim. No\nneed to be polite. Yani led Tran Mack to\nher father, then carefully introduced,\n\"Tran Mack, this is my father.\" He\nfollowed the rules and greeted the\nelder, \"Hello, uncle.\" He said seriously\nto Tranm, \"Young man, you are very good\nand have a lot of personality, but you\nshouldn't be too arrogant.\" He called,\n\"Yani, come over to father.\" Afraid Tran\nMack would have a bad impression of her\nfather, she explained. Tranmac, my\nfather is actually very nice. Please\ndon't take it to heart. Tranmack smiled.\nIt's okay. You go over there. As he said\ngoodbye to Yin Ni, he promised, \"Let's\ncontact each other another day.\"\nHowever, in his heart, he was extremely\nannoyed at this moment, calling me\narrogant. \"If it weren't for Yini's\nface, you wouldn't even have the\nqualifications for me to greet you.\" A\nmoment later, the host smiled and\nopened. Ladies and gentlemen, sorry to\nkeep you waiting. Now, the charity\nauction officially begins. Next, the\nhost introduced. The next auction item\nis said to be a unique object left\nbehind by an ancient immortal. Sitting\nbelow, Tranmack began to sense this\nfamiliar aura that he hadn't encountered\nfor a long time. At this moment on the\nstage was a pink handkerchief,\nincredibly familiar. Tranmack took just\none glance and recognized it in\nastonishment. It was Lac Lee's\nhandkerchief. On it was the aura of the\nprofound Dao sex top tier technique, the\nheavenly profound Dao art. The host\nstirs up the atmosphere. The starting\nprice for this immortals relic is\n100,000 with each bid increase no less\nthan 10,000. The auction begins now.\nMany people raise their hands and the\nprice gradually climbs. 150,000 180,000\n200,000 waiting until there are no more\nbids. Tranmack raises his hand, sealing\nthe deal with a sky-high price of 10\nmillion. The whole hall is filled with\ngasps of amazement. Is this kid crazy?\nIt's just a handkerchief. Duong TNTN is\nso shocked she can't close her mouth. 10\nmillion. Did I hear that right? Tranmack\nbid 10 million. Does he have that much\nmoney? Tranmack has made up his mind,\nignoring the gossip. The relic left by\nhis little junior sister is a priceless\ntreasure to him. No matter the cost, he\nmust obtain it. The host quickly\nrecovers. This gentleman bids 10\nmillion. 10 million going once. 10\nmillion going twice. 10 million going\nthree times. No one else is bidding. She\npoints at Tramac, concluding,\n\"Congratulations, sir. This fairy\nhandkerchief belongs to you.\" After the\nauction ends, Tramac also returns home.\nSeeing the object reminds him of the\nperson, his expression extremely\nsorrowful. Little junior sister.\nTranmack desperately wants to know Lack\nLee's whereabouts. This handkerchief has\na history of at least a thousand years.\nCould it be that his little junior\nsister was reborn in ancient times?\nTranmack begins to recall that\nterrifying day at the all immortals\nforbidden ground, the eye of the\nuniverse. That place sealed a monster.\nThe coffin used for the seal was\nincredibly huge. The two Marshall\nsiblings stood below, looking up,\nceaselessly amazed. Lackli looked more\nand more confused. This is Tramac\nhimself was also puzzled. What is\nsuppressed inside here? Suddenly, a\ngiant hand reached out from within,\nbreaking the seal, catching the two of\nthem off guard. Lackli reacted quickly,\npushing Tranmack out of the danger zone.\nNot good, senior brother. Go quickly.\nBut she herself had no chance to escape.\nAt the final moment, she emotionally\nreached out her hand. Senior brother,\nbefore she could finish her words, Lacai\nhad fallen completely unconscious,\nfalling under control. At that time, he\nshouted helplessly, \"Little Junior\nsister.\" Even till now, he still\nceaselessly blames himself. The nine\nvenerable resting cauldron, the bronze\nstone coffin, the giant hand. What kind\nof existence were those things after\nall? Why was that place called the all\nimmortals forbidden ground, the eye of a\nuniverse? Could the eye of a universe be\nrelated to the most mysterious rules of\ntime? He makes a determination in his\nheart. I must quickly improve my\nstrength to investigate other clues that\nlittle Junior's sister might have left\nbehind. While he is deep in thought,\nsomeone calls him. Hello. Unten calls to\ninform him. Little Mac, martial artists\nsent by the Van family are causing\nunreasonable trouble at the Lambkin\nHotel belonging to the Myoa group. We\ncan't drive them away. Can you ask\nDowist Master Tongue 2 to come help? He\nreplies, \"Okay, I understand. Everyone\nstay calm. Wait for me to arrive, then\nwe'll talk.\" His face becomes extremely\nserious. Since the Van family has done\nthis, I don't mind sending them on their\nway. In the Kin Enip district, the\nLambkin Hotel is brightly lit, preparing\nto welcome guests. A guy named Nam Kung\nLamb Tienne has arrived, resting his\nlegs on the table, provoking, \"Is that\nit? There's a fly in your food. Yet you\noffer no explanation and ignore me. What\nis the meaning of this?\" Van Van Hugh\nalso chimes in with sarcasm. With this\nkind of service attitude, you dare call\nyourself a five-star hotel restaurant?\nThe head chef can't handle them, so he\ncalls chairwoman to fang to confront\nthem. Chairwoman, the hygiene at our\nplace absolutely has no issues. She\ntries to stay calm. I know he was sent\nby the van family to intentionally cause\ntrouble. Just then, familiar footsteps\nand a voice ring out. It seems that last\ntime at the Ken Ang summit, I was too\nmerciful to you people. Tranmack appears\nwith an attitude, fearing neither heaven\nnor earth. Chairwoman DeFong turns\naround in surprise. Little Mac. Tramac\nlooks at her with concern. \"Mom, are you\nall right?\" she replies calmly. \"Mom is\nfine. You're finally here.\" Seeing\nTranac alone, she asks suspiciously,\n\"Where is Dowist?\" Master Tran Tran's\nexpression gradually becomes serious as\nhe walks toward the troublemakers. \"This\ntime, I am personally handling it.\" That\nguy Lamten raises his voice in disdain.\nBrat, relying just on you? Tranmax's\ncold eyes lock onto him, speaking\ndecisively. Don't worry. I guarantee\nthat today you will come but won't be\nable to return. Lamb Tienne stands up\nsaying furiously. Brat, I heard you're\nvery arrogant. Let's see. He immediately\nswings his fist, rushing towards\nTranmack. Now I will teach you a lesson\non behalf of your parents. But Tramax\nslaps him in time. Lamienne is slapped\ndown on the spot. Tranmax says\nscornfully, \"Just a peak internal realm,\nyet you dare to show off in front of\nme.\" He was knocked flat on the ground\nby a single slap. Lamb Tien struggles to\ncrawl up, gritting his teeth. You are a\npeerless grandmaster. His subordinate\nshouts worriedly, \"Young master nom.\"\nLamb Tian hurdly orders. I'm not his\nmatch. Let's retreat. Before leaving, he\ndoesn't forget to leave a provocative\nsentence. Tranmack, this debt today, I\nNamk Lamb Tien will remember it.\nTranmack says coldly, \"Still want to\nleave?\" Tranmack grabs Lamb Ten by the\nneck with one hand, lifting him high.\n\"Who do you think I, Tran Mack am?\" He\nscreams in pain. Brat you. What do you\nwant to do? Van Van Hugh immediately\nrushes over to stop Tranmack. If you\ndare hurt him, the Nomong family will\nlevel the My Hoa group. Tranmack replies\ncoldly. Are you threatening me? He\nreplies, I I'm just telling the truth.\nLamten is strangled until his face turns\npurple, but still tries to provoke,\n\"Brat, for my Nomong family to kill you\nis as simple as crushing an ant. I\nadvise you to obediently let me go. Then\ncow and apologize to me. The people\naround all shout in panic. Tranmack,\ndidn't you hear what young master\nNamkong said? Why haven't you released\nhim yet? Release me quickly. Tranmack\nthinks to himself. Van Van Hugh wants to\nblow things up, right? Fine, I will play\nalong with you. Then he tightens his\ngrip, crushing Lamb Ten to death on the\nspot. Everyone calls out to him in\nhorror. Little Mac. Van Van Hugh\nfuriously threatens Tranmack. You killed\nyoung master Nomong. The Namkong family\nwon't let you off. Tranmack replies\ncoldly. I will be here waiting for them\nto come find me. However, do you think\nyou can leave so easily? Van Van Hugh\nscreams. What do you want to do? Do you\ndare kill me? I'm a secular person. You\nare from the martial arts world. You\ncannot touch me. Tranmack moves his hand\nslightly. I can refrain from killing\nyou, but you must pay a price. Finishing\nhis sentence. Funhu kpish screaming in\npain. Ah. Tranmack warns in a deep\nvoice. Go back and tell Van Trong know\nif there's a next time. I will\ndefinitely wipe out his entire family.\nLie to Fuang and her adopted daughter\nlook at Tranmack in astonishment. Onin\nasks softly, \"Little Mac, did you really\nkill someone?\" Tranmack turns back and\nreplies, \"Dealing with this kind of\nperson, one must use thunderous methods\nto suppress them. One must be ruthless.\nFor everyone's sake, let alone killing\none person. Even if I have to oppose the\nwhole world, I don't care.\" Lafang is\nmoved to tears. Yeah. She rushes over to\nhug Tramac tightly. My good son. Tramac\nalso obediently calls out mom on tin and\nthe chef also look at the mother and son\nwith emotion. The scene shifts to the\ncity center hospital. Doctors are doing\ntheir best in surgery. Van no asks the\ndoctor anxiously. Can my son's legs\nstill recover? The doctor hurriedly\nwipes his sweat and replies impossible.\nThe bones in both places were crushed.\nThe young master can only sit in a\nwheelchair from now on. Van Van Hugh\ncries and tattles. Dad, don't worry\nabout me. Tranmack killed Nom. Kung lamb\ntien. This is already the best result we\ncould achieve. Now we just need to let\nthe N kung family come out to deal with\nTranac. Van no grits his teeth and\nhatred. You just rest and recover. Leave\nthe rest to dad. This time I must make\nthat animal Tranmac pay blood for blood.\nAt this time, Tramac has arrived at the\nvilla at Lacnan slope by Yinqui Lake. A\nservant runs out in panic and asks, \"You\nare?\" Tramac says coldly. \"I know this\nis Van Turong nose house. From now on,\nthis place belongs to me.\" The servant\ntries to stop them in terror. Stop. What\ndo you want to do? Do you want to commit\nillegal trespassing? Tranmack turns his\nhead and orders him. You go tell Van\nTrong no. Thank him for gifting me this\nvilla. That's right. My name is\nTranmack.\nscam scaring the servant into fleeing in\na hurry. Tranmack looks around praising.\nNo wonder it's a villa that cost\nhundreds of millions to build, even left\nempty. It's decorated so luxuriously. He\norders Tran tongue too. You go and form\nso van hung and coin and tell them to\ncollect all kinds of spirit stones and\nprecious jades regardless of size. 10\nstones for one origin nurturing pill,\nunlimited quantity. He immediately\nreplies, \"Yes.\" Tramac turns to the two\nof them and says, \"Everyone pick a room\nas you please. We will live here from\nnow on.\" The two rejoice. Really? That's\ngreat. Afterwards, Tranac goes out to\nthe balcony to meditate. He looks down\nat the lake shore below, thinking to\nhimself, \"The spiritual energy here is\nmuch richer amidst green mountains and\nblue water, a charming landscape just\nright to set up a great heavenly cycle\ncirculation formation.\" Just then,\nsuddenly, a person flies in front of\nTramac. He says coldly, \"Here already.\nI'll give you a chance before you die.\nState your name.\" The man flying in\nfront of Tranmack reveals Nam Kung Vu's\nsword attendant, Coch Trangfong. He says\narrogantly, \"You shouldn't have provoked\nthe Nam Kung family. Go die\nimmediately.\" Coach Chuangfong raises\nhis sword, executing the azure cloud\nsword intent move, slashing straight at\nTramax's head. Tramac also raises his\nfist in his stance, chanting in his\nheart. Heavenly cycle profound god fist\nfirst form. Tranmac decisively launches\na palm strike towards cocktru creating a\ngiant beam of light. Coach Truang Fong\nis immediately knocked flying. Tranmack\ncalmly walks closer to cocktung\nLamb. Tien's father Nam Kung Long\nwitnessing this scene is extremely\nterrified. How is it possible? Such a\npowerful sword strike. How did he block\nit? Tranmack discovers him, opening his\nmouth to say, \"The one hiding over\nthere.\" It's your turn. Nam Kung Long is\nstartled, saying in panic, \"Brat, don't\ntouch me. Otherwise, wait until my\nfather comes out of seclusion. You're\ndead for sure. The words are not yet\nfinished.\" Tranmac has already launched\na palm strike, hitting Nam Kung Long\nuntil he staggers and is about to fall.\nHe says coldly, \"Even if your father\ndoesn't come find me, I will go find\nhim.\" At this moment, Tran Mack notices\ncockt\n7 days anyway. Tran Mack says with\ninterest, \"But I'm starting to look\nforward to Nam Kung Vu's strength.\" Time\npasses. One week later, Tran Mack picked\nup a stone and said, \"These secular old\nmen are indeed still somewhat useful.\"\nJust then, the phone rang and he picked\nit up immediately. Hello, Yiani. What's\nup? On the other end, she asked, \"The\nday after tomorrow is my birthday party.\nCan you come?\" Tramac replied, \"No\nproblem.\" Yini said with satisfaction,\n\"Great. See you then.\" Hanging up the\nphone, he fell in a deep thought. I\nremember in my past life, something\nhappened during this birthday party of\nMo Dong Yi. No matter what in this life,\nI will absolutely not let Mo Dong Yini\nface any danger. At this moment, Tranmac\nhad finished arranging the protective\nspells for the house. The spirit\ngathering formation is complete. Plus\nthe illusion array. Without my order, no\none can get close to the villa. Then he\ndripped water into a bottle, picking it\nup with satisfaction. Another plan of\nmine can be deployed. Now the scene\nshifts to a luxurious villa. Inside a\nman is lying on his stomach sunbathing,\nsurrounded by beauties serving him.\nSuddenly a voice called out, \"So Van\nHung,\" he immediately turned his head\nand shouted, \"Who?\" upon seeing\nTranmack. So, Van Hung's face instantly\nturned pale. \"Grandmaster TR, why are\nyou here?\" Tranmack said as he walked\nin, \"I have something for you to do. Sit\ndown.\" So, Van Hung immediately sat up,\nsaying respectfully, \"Yes.\" He thought\nto himself, \"This clubhouse clearly has\nhundreds of bodyguards. Not even a fly\ncan get in. He really comes and goes\nlike a ghost.\" Suddenly, Tramac took out\na bottle of water. Confusing, \"So, Van\nhung.\" This is Tranmack explained as he\npoured the water out. This is spiritual\nenergy water. The water dripped onto the\ngrass. Weeds immediately grew into a\nsapling and a second later bloomed into\nfive colored flowers. So Van Hung was\nstunned. This is divine water. Tranmack\nrevealed, \"Spiritual energy water has an\nextremely obvious effect on these types\nof plants. If humans drink it for a long\ntime, it can cure all diseases and\nprolong life.\" He cried out in shock.\nCure all diseases prolong life. Isn't\nthis an elixir? So Van Hung immediately\nclasped his hands in excitement and\npleaded. Grandmaster TR, is this\nspiritual energy water for sale? Name\nyour price. I absolutely won't hesitate.\nTranmack replied, I don't want to sell\nit to you. I want you to establish a\ncompany, dilute this spiritual energy\nwater, and sell it to the public. I'll\ngive you 20% of the profit. So Van\nHung's eyes lit up. I'll do it. I'll do\nit. I'll go do it right away. He thought\nto himself, I'm rich. I'm rich.\nMoreover, I won't lack spiritual energy\nwater in the future. So, Van Hung asked\nsuspiciously. Grandmaster TR, don't you\ndisregard worldly wealth? Why do you\nwant to sell spiritual energy water?\nTranmack replied coldly. This is a\nsetup. You don't even know too much. So,\nVan Hungurly obeyed, \"Yes, I understand.\nI absolutely won't ask more.\" Then he\nasked, \"Grandmaster TR, what do you want\nto name a company?\" Tramac thought for a\nmoment and replied, \"Taken from Yinqi\nLake. Let's call it Qui-Ho Life Spirit\nLiquid.\" So, Van Hung shouted happily,\n\"Good. It will definitely sell very\nwell.\" The next day at the subway\nstation, Tramax sat in the carriage,\nsilently looking out the window. Mo Dong\nYin Ni's 18th birthday this time is\norganized very grandly. The banquet\ntakes place in Bachm district. Suddenly,\nan arrogant voice rang out. Hey, switch\nseats with us. An arrogant purple-haired\ngirl was ordering Tram Mac. Did you hear\nme? Fuang Fi said rudely. Change seats\nfor my brother. You go sit over there. I\nwant to sit with him. But Tramac didn't\neven bother to look at her, saying, \"My\nseat ticket says it's here. Why should I\nswitch for you?\" Fangfi argued\nunreasonably. \"You're sitting alone. My\nbrother and I are two people. We want to\nsit together, so naturally, you have to\nswitch.\" Tramax still firmly refused to\nswitch. She was furious. you. Fuangfi\nturned to the person next to her and\ncomplained. I'm so angry, brother. Teach\nhim a lesson for me. Vuvanton just said\ncalmly, \"All right, little sister. He\ndoesn't switch. That's is right. We\ncan't force him.\" His eyes stared at\nTramac, observing carefully. A moment\nlater, the announcement on the train\nrang out. Arrived at Bachma District.\nPassengers, please prepare to get off.\nTramac thought, I remember the location\nis Ton Long Manor. At this moment,\nsomeone walked towards him. It was those\ntwo troublesome people again. Vuvantine\nsaid arrogantly, \"Kid, just now on the\ntrain, it was crowded, so it wasn't\nconvenient for me to teach you a lesson.\nNow you still want to leave.\" Vu Vanton\nsaid doineeringly, \"Hurry up and\napologize to my sister, and I'll let you\ngo. Otherwise, I don't mind beating you\nup so you'll remember it.\" But Tramac\njust said, \"You think cultivating to the\ninternal realm allows you to do whatever\nyou want?\" He was immediately surprised.\nYou know the internal realm? You're also\na martial artist. Having said that, Vu\nVanton was beaten by Tranmack until he\nvomited blood. He coldly knocked Vu\nVanton to the ground, saying, \"If I\nwasn't in a hurry, you would be dead.\"\nVu Vanton held his bruised face and\nasked, \"Who exactly are you?\" Tramac\nglanced at Fuangfi and said, \"I am not\nsomeone you people can provoke.\" She was\nstartled, huh? What do you want to do?\nDon't come over here. He grabbed Fuangfi\nby the collar and lifted her up. Scared\nnow. Too late. She screamed in terror.\nYou What do you want to do? She was just\nlike the others who had threatened\nTranmack. I am from a Vuvan family. If\nyou dare to bully me, my father will\nkill you. Tranmack threw Fuangfi\ndirectly into the trash can. Turning\naround to leave, I'll wait. At this\nmoment, Tramac had arrived. He opened\nthe car door and stepped out. Everyone\nwho saw Tranmack was extremely\nsurprised. Who is this kid? Taking a\ntaxi to Tom Long Manor. I guess he must\nbe a classmate of Miss Yani coming to\nmooch food and drinks. As he walked into\nthe lobby, he muttered, \"I'll meet Emo\nDong Yini in a bit. give her the gift\nand then leave. Vinho was very surprised\nto see Tramac. Isn't that Tramac? He\ncame too. Kat was also very surprised.\nHe actually came. A blonde rich second\ngeneration in Bachma district named Vuia\nhow spoke up to insult. Tranmac this\ntrash also came to attend Yiani's\nbirthday party. He doesn't even check if\nhe's worthy. Cut walked up to him and\nsaid, \"Tran Mack, you shouldn't have\ncome here.\" She used a lecturing tone. I\nadvise you to give up your delusional\nwishful thinking about Yin Ni. Doing\nthis only brings humiliation upon\nyourself. Tranmack brushed past her,\nreplying coldly. What I do, I know\nclearly in my heart. Stop bothering me.\nCut spoke loudly and bluntly. Tranmack,\neven if you have the Mihoa group, it\nwon't amount to anything here. What do\nyou have to compete with them? You and\nYiani are basically people from two\ndifferent worlds. You are not worthy of\nYiani. Tranmack immediately retorted out\nof respect for uncle and this is the\nlast time I allow you to speak to me\nlike that. Now get lost. Katy was angry\nbut helpless. Had to say you are truly\nunreasonable. Tranmac walked away\nthinking you only know the mo dung\nfamily is powerful but you don't know\nthat I am long no longer than me of the\npast. At this moment Gia house shouted\nyoung master ton fi. It turned out the\ntwo people who bullied Tranmack at the\nsubway station were them. Gia how\nimmediately tattled young master Ton\nYiani's rumored boyfriend also came\ntoday. Vuvanton said coldly, \"I know,\ndaring to steal my Vu Vanton's woman. I\nmust teach him a proper lesson.\" Xi\nimmediately pointed at Tramac and said,\n\"That guy is over there.\" Vu Vanton was\ninstantly stunned. What? It's him. He\ngritted his teeth, saying furiously,\n\"Brat, enemies really do cross paths on\na narrow road. Heaven has a path you\ndon't take. Hell has no door, yet you\nbarge in.\" \"Io was confused. What is\nyoung master doing? Is he not planning\nto deal with that kid?\" Just then, the\ncrowd around suddenly bustled. Look\nquickly. Young Masterton is back. Who is\nthe person walking behind him? That is\nChu Tian Vong. Boss Chu Vu Vanton\nimmediately said to him, \"Uncle, it's\nhim.\" Everyone recognized the man who\njust appeared. The Chu family is the\ngreat family ranked only second to the\nEmo Dong family. This kid is dead for\nsure. Fangfi sneered. Bastard. Don't\ndream of walking out of here today. I\nwill let you know the consequences of\noffending the Vu Van family. Kadia\nthought, I advise you to leave just now.\nAnd you didn't listen. Now it's too late\nto leave. Fongfi immediately squeezed\nout a few crocodile tears and ran out,\ncomplaining to Chu Tien Vong. Uncle Chu,\nyou must seek justice for me. This\nbastard bullied me. He walked up to Tra\nand said, \"Kid, go apologize to them. I\nwill temporarily let you off this time.\"\nTrust\nfocused on drinking wine, saying one\nword, scram. Chuen Vong stared wideeyed\nin shock. Seeing Transmac's arrogant\nattitude, everyone was terrified to the\nextreme. Did I hear correctly? Is this\nkid crazy? He dared to tell Chu Tien\nVong to scram. Even the old man of the\nMod Dong family wouldn't dare speak to\nChu Tien Vong like that. Chu Tien Vong\nwill kill him. Vu Vanton with one side\nof his face still swollen said smuggly,\n\"You are dead for sure.\" Fangfi also\nshouted excitedly. \"Uncle Chu, he won't\nlet him off easily.\" An old man standing\nbehind Tien Vong opened his mouth to\nscold Tranac. Impedent. Are you tired of\nliving? At this moment, Trax's whole\nbody erupted with divine flames, saying\ncoldly, just a measly peak internal\nrealm martial artist scram to the side.\nThe old man immediately blocked in front\nof Anton. Mr. Chu, please step back.\nThis kid's strength is not inferior to\nTien Vong. Tien Vong immediately\nordered, \"Kill him. I will bear all\nconsequences.\" At this moment, Mo Dunk\nappeared, asking, \"What is going on?\"\nVanton was very surprised. Uncle Amo\nDong. He walked to Tien Vongside and\nsaid, \"Brother Chu, today is my\ndaughter's coming of age ceremony. Don't\nbe so angry.\" Tien Vong recounted\nfuriously, \"Brother Mo Dong, there's\nactually someone who dared to tell me to\nscram.\" Mo Dong looked at Tramac,\nalso feeling very helpless. This kid is\ntruly a troublemaker. He turned to Tien\nVong and said, \"Brother Chu, give me\nsome face here outside Tonlong Manor.\nYou can do whatever you want. Tien Vong\nalso agreed. All right. Out of respect\nfor brother Mo Dong, I naturally have to\nlisten. Then he turned to warn Tranmac.\nKid, don't let me meet you outside.\nVanton said resentfully, \"Kid, count\nyourself lucky.\" At this moment, Emo\nDong walked up to Tranac and said,\n\"Even I have to give Chu Tien Vong some\nrespect. You are too arrogant.\" Tramac\nreplied coldly, \"I'm not arrogant. I\nhave strength. The Chu family, the Vuvan\nfamily, even your Mod Dung family. No\nmatter how capable your methods are, in\nmy eyes, you're not worth mentioning.\nEmo Dung cockside wearily. Once you\nleave the manor, you're on your own. I\nwant to offend the Vu Van family and the\nChu family for you. Just then, everyone\ngasped in surprise. Look quickly. Miss\nYiani is out. A brilliant crown\nappeared. Yiani stepped out wearing a\nprincess dress. Extremely beautiful and\nmoving. Fangf marveled. Sister Yiani is\ntruly beautiful. You have to try your\nbest. Absolutely don't let anyone else\nsteal her away. Vanton said confidently.\nDon't worry. Anyone who wants to eye her\nwill have to pay a heavy price. Yani\nimmediately spoke respectfully. Thank\nyou all for taking the time out of your\nbusy schedules to attend my birthday\nparty. I would like to send my sincerest\nthanks to everyone. A guest secretly\nadmired. worthy of being a member of the\nEmo Dung family. Proper speech and\nconduct, elegant attitude, neither\narrogant nor impetuous. Emo Dunkk really\nhas a fine daughter. Then came a series\nof luxurious gifts presented by\neveryone. Niani, this is my birthday\ngift to you. I hope you like it. Just a\nlittle token of my heart. Please accept\nit. Kathy held Yianni's hand and\npraised. Yani, you look so beautiful\ntoday. She replied, \"Thank you.\" At this\nmoment, Yiani's eyes searched for a\nfigure in the crowd. Seeing Tranmack\njust standing motionless to one side,\nshe couldn't help but wonder. Did Tran\nnot prepare a birthday gift for me?\nRegardless of what it is, I will like\nit. But Yiani thought again. Forget it.\nIt's good that he came. It proves that\nhe still has me in his heart. Jia how\nimmediately mocked Tramac. Tramac, today\nis Yiani's 18th birthday. I don't know\nwhat gift you prepared. Tramac replied,\n\"Yenei's birthday. How can I not have a\ngift?\" Saying that, he slowly walked\ntowards Yiani. Tramac took out a\nnecklace set with an emerald put around\nYianni's neck and said, \"This was made\nby my own hands for you.\" Tramac said\ngently, \"Happy birthday,\" Yiani replied.\n\"Thank you, Tramac.\" Everyone was\nimmediately stunned. \"Huh?\" He even\nhelped her put it on. Van was furious.\n\"Damn it, this trash is pushing his\nluck.\" After giving the gift, Tramac\nsaid, \"Yenei, I still have some\nbusiness. I'll go first.\" Yiani\nimmediately held him back. Ah, stay and\neat before you go. Seeing this, Vuia how\nimmediately sees the opportunity to\nbelittle him, laughing scornfully. Oh\nmy, someone used street stall goods\nworth a few pennies as a birthday gift.\nNo wonder he doesn't even want to eat.\nHe's afraid of being discovered by\nothers and losing face. Right. Tranmack\nturned around and warned, \"If today\nwasn't Yini's birthday, I would have\nbeaten you to death.\" He didn't know\nlife from death. Raising his head to\nprovoke what? You use street stall goods\nas a gift and you won't let others speak\nabout it. Yi immediately stepped in to\nmake peace. Everyone coming is enough.\nGifts really aren't important. Tranmack\nthen opened his mouth. The gift I\nTranmack give. How can it be something\nyou mortals can compare to? He pointed\nat the jade pendant, his wrist shaking.\nA stream of magical energy wrapped\naround Yeni. Everyone was astonished.\nWhat is this? Yi also cried out\ncomfortably. It feels so light and\nrefreshing. This jade pendant is so\nmagical. Vuvanton's face turned green as\nhe exclaimed, \"This is pure water\nattributes spiritual power fluctuation.\"\nHow is that possible? This jade pendant\nis a magical artifact. The thing he gave\nis actually a magical artifact.\nSuddenly, a man walked closer and\nsuggested emo dong yini. Miss, can I\ntake a look at that j pendant? She was\npuzzled. Uncle twe. Then she handed the\nnecklace to him. Uncle, take a look.\nUncle Twi observed the necklace\nintently. A moment later, he returned\nthe necklace and reminded, \"Miss, you\nmust wear this jade pendant on your body\nat all times.\" He also seriously\ndeclared, making Vuia how ashamed to the\npoint of losing all face. This jade\npendant is the most precious gift today.\nOther things compared to it are all\ntrash. Then he turned to Tramac and\nsaid, \"You were able to give such a\nprecious item to Yin Ni. On behalf of\nYin Ni, I thank you.\" Hearing this,\nGia's face darkened as he gritted his\nteeth and thought, \"Damn it, I didn't\nexpect this old man to value that jade\npennant so much.\" And Kadette also\nthought suspiciously. Tranmac, exactly\nhow many secrets are you still hiding on\nyour body that you don't want others to\nknow? As for Yenne, she felt extremely\nhappy in her heart, her cheeks flushing,\nthinking to herself, \"Tranmac gave me\nsuch a precious item. It seems I'm very\nimportant in his heart.\" Suddenly, a\nperson was knocked to the ground. An\nangry voice rang out. Who is it? A group\nof people slowly walked in. They were\neven carrying a funeral wreath. Everyone\nimmediately buzzed with discussion. What\nis this situation giving a funeral\nwreath? This is truly a slap in the face\nto the Mo Dung family. Mo Dunk and Uncle\nTwi were both terrified, shouting\nloudly, \"Who are you people? Do you know\nwhere this is?\" The person entering was\na middle-aged man. He replied, \"Of\ncourse I know. Isn't this the Mod Dung\nfamily's Tonlong manner? Mod Dung\nasked suspiciously. Who exactly are you?\nThe man raised his eyebrows, replying\nwith hidden meaning. Who I am is not\nimportant. I just want to demand justice\nfor the dozen lives of the Tam Hop\nSociety. Hearing this, everyone was\nterrified. Tam Hop Society, Emo Dung\nquickly ordered, \"Men, arrest him.\"\nHe still calmly said, \"Mr. Emo Dung acts\nso quickly. Are you afraid I will speak\nout about the Mo Dung family's old\naffairs? The Mo Dung family members\nimmediately rushed forward. However, his\nbodyguards jumped up, kicking each\nperson, punching after kicking, missing\nno one. The man from the Tam Hop Society\ncontinued to provoke. Mr. Emo Dung, this\nbunch of subordinates of yours are\ngetting worse and worse. Could it be\nthat after the Emo Dung family washed\ntheir hands of the business, even the\nbodyguards are just called in to make up\nthe numbers? Montak Donkak roared in\nanger. Unlui. Uncle Twi quickly stepped\nforward and responded. Yes. Outsiders\ndared to be so arrogant. Die. The two\nreleased their aura. The power was\nastonishing. He provoked. Come here. Let\nme see. Uncle Twe and the man from the\nTam Hop Society rushed into combat. The\nsurrounding people watched in\nfascination, discussing excitedly. Truly\nmartial arts experts. This scene is\nexactly like in the movies. So\nformidable. Uncle Twe quickly punched\nhim in the stomach, beating him until\nhis face turned pale. Uggh. He retreated\na few steps, clutching his chest in\npain, and said, \"It seems that relying\nonly on the Tam Hop Society, there's no\nway to demand justice.\" Then that guy\nturned around and shouted loudly.\n\"Master Emo Dungk was a bit wary, asking\ncuriously, behind this old guy, there is\nstill an expert. Having said that, a man\nwith a long scar on his right, I walked\nin. He asked, \"Mo Dongk, do you still\nremember me?\" Mo Dungk's face\nimmediately became furious, replying,\n\"You are Nambatien, son of Nam Tienhan.\"\nBatien laughed weirdly, touching the\nscar, and said, \"It seems you haven't\nforgotten this scar cut by your own\nhand. You certainly didn't expect me to\nstill be alive, right?\" He glared,\nfilled with hatred, and said, \"Years\nago, you wiped out my whole Nam family,\nswallowed the Tam Hop Society hole.\nToday, you will have to pay a heavy\nprice.\" Hearing this, Emo Dong\nordered, \"Uncle Twi arrest him.\" Uncle\nTwi responded immediately, \"Yes, sir.\"\nHowever, he was not afraid at all, veins\npopping out, frowning as he said, \"I\nremember you. It was you who killed my\nparents with your own hands. Luckily,\nyou are still alive, so I can take\nrevenge now.\" Uncle Twi also retorted,\n\"Cut the crap. If you want revenge, you\nmust have real ability.\" Uncle Twe\nimmediately channeled his energy, his\nskin becoming younger, shouting loudly.\nRemnant of the Tam Hop Society die.\nEveryone was astonished. Is this the\nlegendary rejuvenation? But Batien just\ncurled his lips in disdain. That's all\nthere is to it. Uncle Twi swung his fist\nand rushed forward. However, Batienne\nwas a step faster, punching him. You\ndon't know your own strength. Baten\nturned to Emo Dong and beckoned,\n\"Leave your life here.\" Suddenly, Emo\nDong Yini jumped out from who knows\nwhere, shouting loudly. You are not\nallowed to harm my father. Seeing this,\nBien smiled ludely. Emo Dong you\ngave birth to a pretty decent daughter.\nSaying that, Batien quickly reached out,\ngrabbing Yeni. If I humiliate your\ndaughter in front of everyone, will you\nfeel even worse than death? Yani\nscreamed in horror. Let me go. You dare.\nYou dare. Emo dung shook all over\ngritting his teeth and roaring.\nNambatien, I'll fight you to the death.\nDuong TNT asked worriedly, \"What do we\ndo now? We can't just watch Yin knee be\nhumiliated.\" The purple-haired girl also\nreplied fearfully, \"But we don't have\nthe ability to save people. We basically\ncan't save her.\" Vu van Fuangfi called\nsoftly, \"Brother, that guy wants to\nbully Yini. Do you have any way to save\nher?\" Vu Vanton, cold sweat streaming\ndown, replied, \"I can't beat him. I\ncan't throw away my life for a woman.\nMoreover, if the Emo Dong family\ncollapses, our Vu van family can just\ntake the opportunity to rise up. You\nhurry and hide in the back. Don't let\nhim discover you.\" Fuangfi obediently\nshut her mouth. \"Yes, on this side,\"\nBatien licked his lips while threatening\nEmo Dong. \"Watch carefully. The good\nshow is starting.\" Having said that, a\nfist flew straight into his mouth. It\nwas Tramac who rushed over in time to\npunch him away. He held Yin knee and\nsaid, \"Daring to bully my classmate in\nfront of me makes me lose a lot of\nface.\" Boten was beaten badly, falling\nto the ground, questioning, \"Who are you\nto dare?\" Tran Mack replied\nindifferently. \"Is there anything I\ndon't dare to do?\" The other man rushed\nup again, threatening fiercely, \"Don't\ntouch my master.\" Tranmack just casually\npunched towards him saying with disgust\nnot knowing your own strength. He was\nimmediately sent flying hitting the wall\nface pale unconscious. Tranmax stood in\nfront of Yini and said you hide in a\nsafe place first. Lie to Fuang saw this\nscene extremely astonished. TNT happily\nsaid to Cod, \"That's great. She's saved\nbut she didn't notice.\" Thinking to\nherself, \"Exactly how strong is\nTranmack?\" Uncle Twee shouted joyfully,\n\"We're saved this time.\" Emo dung\navoided his gaze replying turns out he\nis so strong. Vanton also stared with\nwide eyes and open mouth exclaiming he\nis actually so strong. No impulsive.\nBatian struggled to stand up and said\nreally makes one surprised to mock still\nhas a dog that knows how to bite people\nlike this. Tranmack glared and warned.\nYou can take revenge as you please but\nyou are not allowed to touch Yi. Hearing\nthese words, he laughed loudly, laugh at\nme to death. Just now you were merely\nlaunching a sneak attack. What are you\nbeing arrogant about? Finishing his\nsentence, he jumped up to attack. Taste\nthis. Tranmac immediately extended a\nfinger. Stop. Baten froze in midair. He\nthought to himself, \"Damn it, why can't\nI move anymore?\" Tranmack waved his\nhand. He immediately fell flat on his\nback. But he still stiffened his mouth\nand continued, \"It seems you are worthy\nfor me to treat seriously, kid. No\nmatter how strong you are, could you be\nstronger than a grandmaster? The\ngossiping crowd busily discussed. He was\nactually flying. Grandmaster, can Tramac\nwin? Tramac replied with disdain.\nGrandmaster, relying just on you. You're\nat most a half-step. Grandmaster.\nBatenne laughed loudly. Killing you is\nenough. Blood demon, great hand seal.\nUncle Twee screamed in horror. Blood\ndemon, great hand seal. His master is\nthe grandmaster rampant in Southeast\nAsia known as the eightarmed divine ape.\nJust as Batien shouted, \"Kill that palm\nprint flew right in front of Trmac.\" The\ncrowd buzzed, \"Such a powerful strike.\nCan he block it?\" Duong Teni screamed in\nterror. Tranmac over here. Tranmac\nsmiled disdainfully. Too weak, pitifully\nweak. He immediately launched a move.\nHeavenly mystic divine fist first form,\nsevering mountains and rivers. In an\ninstant, Tramac's fist collided with a\npalm print. Baten was immediately\nblasted away. Tramac retracted his fist,\nspeaking slowly, heavenly mystic divine\nfist second form, overturning rivers.\nBaktin trembled, clutching his chest,\nthinking, \"Not good. I must find a way\nto escape.\" Glancing at Yin Ni in the\ncrowd, he shouted loudly, \"You be my\nhostage.\" Yini screamed in terror. \"Ah,\nsave me, Tranmac.\" Batien targeted Yin\nNi standing nearby this time. No,\nhowever, it seems something blocked him.\nHe exclaimed in shock. It's this\nnecklace forming a barrier protecting\nher. A magical artifact. Baten still\nfrantically try to break it. Break for\nme? Yi screamed in fear. Ah. However,\nBatien couldn't break it no matter what.\nHe said angrily. This magical artifact\ncan actually withstand a full force\npunch for me. Yini was no longer afraid.\nShe happily held the jade pendant and\nsaid, \"This blue light screen is from\nthe jade pennant Tramac gave me. It\nturns out to be a protective magical\nartifact.\" Seeing the scene, Kier\nsilently looked at Tranac, thinking, \"If\nI go find Tranmack, if I want this jade\npendant, will he give it to me?\" Tranmac\nslowly stepped forward, reminding, \"Old\nman, don't disturb a little girl\nanymore.\" Vaten replied despicably,\n\"Damn it, I admit defeat this time. Next\ntime, none of you will escape.\" Having\nsaid that, Tranmack had no intention of\nletting him go. His terrifying gaze\nasking, \"You still have a next time?\"\nVaten immediately sensed danger and\nfroze. He immediately sped up to run for\nhis life, but still didn't forget to\nlaugh smugly. I admit you are very\nstrong, but if I want to leave, no one\ncan stop me. Suddenly, Tranmack took out\na magical treasure and activated his\nmagic power. Uncle Twe turned pale with\nfright. Internal energy released\nexternally. This is a transformation\nrealm. Grandmaster. Baten was hit\nscreaming unwillingly. What? Ace. I am\nnot resigned. Finally, he collapsed to\nthe ground, spitting fresh blood, but\nstill tried to weeze. My master won't\nlet you off. Tranmac didn't bother to\ncare. Turning to leave. The crowd\ncheered. Nambati is dead. Tramac one.\nUncle Twi still said with admiration, an\n18-year-old grandmaster. If I hadn't\nseen it with my own eyes, I wouldn't\nbelieve it even if you beat me to death.\nEmo Dungk also smiled helplessly. Before\nI thought he was too arrogant. Turns out\nhe possesses absolute strength. He\nthought to himself in front of his power\nthat holds life and death. Money and\nstatus are just trash. As long as one\npossesses that power, why worry about\nlacking money or status? Tramac walked\nto Yiani's side, asking gently. I didn't\nscare you, did I? She replied. With you\nhere, what do I have to fear? And\nKadette looked at the romantic scene\nbetween the two, thinking confusedly.\nBefore I advised him to give up pursuing\nYin Ni, he said he and I are not from\nthe same world. It turns out I am the\nridiculous one. Suddenly, Tranmack\nturned back solemnly and said, \"Continue\nYin Ni's birthday party. But before\nthat, need to clean up some trash.\" Yin\nand He was bewildered. Who in the crowd?\nChuen Vong was trembling. Tranmack\nwalked closer and questioned before you\nwant to kill me. He hurriedly denied.\nGrandmaster Grandmaster TR\nmisunderstanding. It's all just a\nmisunderstanding. But Tran Mack didn't\nintend to spare his life, saying coldly.\nI've always been clear about kindness\nand grudges. You wanted to kill me.\nNaturally, I won't be polite. Tien\nVaughong cowtowed and begged.\nGrandmaster, I was wrong. I was wrong. I\nbeg you to spare me. Having said that,\nTranmack decisively finished him off.\nThe crowd buzzed. Chu Tien Vong is dead.\nWhat exactly happened? Tranmack kills\nimmediately when he says so. After that,\nTranmack turned to Vu Vanton and Vu Van\nFuangfi. Fuangfi burst into tears,\nbegging, \"Ah, don't kill me. Don't kill\nme.\" Vu Vanton also knelt down to admit\nhis mistake. Grandmaster, I I\nunintentionally offended, begging\nGrandmaster for forgiveness. A hint of\nhesitation flashed in Tramax's eyes.\nAfter thinking for a moment, Tramac\ndecided, \"All right, after all, today is\nYini's birthday. I will just abolish\nyour cultivation and be done with it.\"\nVuv\nfalling to the ground in pain. Ah! On my\nbody! Emo Dong stepped forward to\nthank. Thank you for saving our lives.\nGrandmaster Tran Tran Mack waved his\nhand. No need. I did this for Yini. Yini\nwalked closer, blushing and suggesting.\nTranmack, can you celebrate my birthday\nwith me today? Tranmack happily\naccepted. Me and Kadu yet witnessed\neverything. Tears couldn't help but\nfall. She thought with jealousy and\nanger. Why? All these things should have\nbelonged to me. Why did it turn out like\nthis oa? So Van Hung looked at his watch\nanxiously, muttering to himself, why\nhasn't grandmaster TR returned yet? At\nthis moment, footsteps sounded. Tran\nMack had returned. So Van Hung hurriedly\nsaid, \"Grandmaster Tran, you're finally\nback. Our life spirit liquid supply\ncannot meet demand, but that sung Ton\nfamily in Tukqin keeps slandering you.\nThey even dare to counterfeit our\nproducts for profit.\" He pleaded\npainfully. That sung Ton family in Tkin\nis no less powerful than the Kim family\nin Kening. Olo and I really have no\nother way. We have to ask you to take\naction. Tranmack replied in a deep\nvoice. Since that's the case, I will\npersonally deal with its ton family\nmanner of its ton family. In the main\nhall, rows of luxury cars were parked\nneatly. The guests were drinking and\ndiscussing. The Tong Ton patriarch is\nout. I guess he wants to announce\nsomething related to life spirit liquid.\nThen patriarch Seong Tan walked out\ngreeting enthusiastically. Thank you all\nfor giving face to me, Sean. Everyone\npresent here is a friend of the Tssung\nTon family. He glanced with hidden\nmeaning. As for those who didn't come,\nmy Tong Ton family will visit them one\nby one later. Huh. Then he continued,\neveryone, I know you all aim for the\nhuge benefits of life spirit liquid, but\nI want to invite everyone to join me in\npreventing life spirit liquid from\npenetrating the market and at the same\ntime counterattack fiercely to seize and\ncompletely control it. A guest raised\nhis hand to ask, \"Patriarch Zong Ton,\nthat life spirit liquid is extremely\nmagical. It will soon be famous all over\nthe country. What do we have to fight\nagainst them?\" Hearing this, Patriarch\nSong Ton replied confidently. Don't\nworry. I have researched a product even\nmore effective than Life Spirit Liquid.\nAs long as everyone follows me, we will\ndefinitely succeed. He thought to\nhimself, \"As long as I can counterfeit\nlife, spirit liquid and fleece these\nlambs that sung Ton family will become\nthe overlord.\" Receiving the answer, the\ncrowd was led by the nose, cheering\nexcitedly. Since that's the case, I am\nwilling to follow patriarch Ton. I'm\nalso willing. He had achieved his goal.\nA fake smile on his face. Good. Thank\nyou everyone. I absolutely won't let you\nsuffer losses. However, there was a man\nleisurely smoking a cigar, not saying a\nword. Patriarch Sung Tan asked in\nconfusion. However, I don't know what\nthe inf family's attitude is regarding\nthis matter. He stepped forward to\nremind, \"Brethren, you should also show\nyour attitude.\" And Natan smiled and\nreplied, \"Brother Tong Tan, I also had\npeople research that live spirit liquid,\nbut found nothing. How'd you do it so\nwell?\" Patriarch Seong Tan said\ndispleasedly, \"This is a secret of my\nson Ton family. Only if brother helped\nme first can I reveal this secret to\nyou.\" The ton then spoke bluntly without\nholding back. That's difficult. Who\nknows if you're deceiving everyone or\nnot? Vinton's son rushed forward\nangrily. Arrogant brat. Tranmack shook\nhis head in boredom. I said you only\nhave one chance to attack. Why don't you\ncherish it? Tranmack calmly raised his\nhand, shouting loudly. Suppress. Tons\nwas knocked back, exclaiming in horror.\nWhat? Tranmax said disdainfully. Is this\nall the skill you have? He lay paralyzed\non the ground, gasping for breath,\nspitting out a mouthful of blood and\npain. Seeing this, Patriarch Seong Tan\nexclaimed in horror, \"This? How is this\npossible?\" Vinton's son was defeated\nagain. \"You, you are Grandmaster Tran.\nEveryone around was dumbfounded.\"\n\"Grandmaster Tran, he really is\nGrandmaster Tran. That aura is much\nstronger than Vinton's son. He is\ndefinitely a supreme Grandmaster.\" At\nthis moment, Ton's son trembled and\nforced himself to stand up. You think he\nwon? Suddenly, he took out a small\nmirror, sprayed a mouthful of blood on\nit, shouting open. Vinton's son\nimmediately transformed like Superman.\nTramac was also slightly surprised\nseeing this. Thinking another high-grade\ndefensive magical artifact. Seems like\nthis guy has had a fortuitous encounter.\nHe regained his confidence, laughing\nloudly. Haha, can you break my defense?\nTranmack immediately leaped up,\nshouting, \"Heavenly mystic divine fist\nsecond form, severing mountains and\nrivers.\" Ton's son was dumbfounded, not\ndaring to believe his eyes. Impossible.\nBefore he could react, he was blown\naway. The small mirror fell right at\nTrmach's feet. Tramac picked it up,\nmuttering this pattern. Suddenly, the\nmirror turned into a tiny gold ring,\nautomatically putting itself on his\nfinger. Tranmack turned around looking\ngrimly at Patriarch Seong Ton and said,\n\"Next.\" Patriarch Seong Ton panicked and\nknelt down, begging humbly. Grandmaster\nTran, I was wrong. I beg you to spare me\nonce. My Tong Ton family will honor you\nas the leader in the future. Everyone, I\nbeg you to spare my life. This is to\nshow respect to you. But Tramac just\nreplied coldly. Too late. Having said\nthat, a beam of light shot through his\nhead. Seeing Patriarch Seong Ton fall,\nthe crowd gasped in horror. Patriarch\nSeung Ton died just like that. So scary.\nGrandmaster TR, spare us. They all knelt\ndown and begged. Grandmaster TR, spare\nus. We were all forced. Tranmack turned\nto Naton, instructing regarding the life\nspirit liquid matter contact so van hung\nin Kinep. He will naturally know what I\nmean. He replied, \"Yes, sir.\"\nGrandmaster Tran Tranmack waved his\nsleeve, turning to leave. Stand up all\nof you. I only came to punish the Song\nTon family. A moment later, Vinton's son\nwoke up groggy. Uggh. What happened to\nme? He was horrified to find Tranmax\nsitting on him. It's you. What do you\nwant to do? Tramac questioned. I asked\nyou, where did you get this bronze\nmirror? Vinton's son sweated profusely,\nconfessing that magical artifact was\nsnatched by me from a tomb raider. He\nsaid he got it from the Nia ruins deep\nin the desert. Tramac crossed his arms.\nDoubtful. Nia ruins. That is the Jingua\nancient city. Tranmax secretly guessed.\nCould it be that immortal cultivators\nonce existed there? Then he ordered,\ntake me to the Jingua ancient city.\nTan's son stammered. You alit. Time\npassed. 3 days later at the entrance of\nJingu ancient city, Mount Calamali.\nTranmack and Vin Tan's son road camels.\nHe reported, \"Master Tran, we're almost\nthere.\" Tranmac observed the situation,\nsilently evaluating. The open door ahead\nwas slashed open by someone with a\nsingle sword strike. A trace of\nspiritual power still lingers on it. He\nsaid, \"Master Tran, this cliff face\nseems to have been chiseled by someone.\nIt is incredibly smooth.\" Tranmax said\nin surprise, \"We are nearing the end of\nthe road. Ahead is the Jingua ancient\ncity. Before their eyes were the ruins\nof an ancient city that was once very\nmajestic. Now only dilapidated walls\nremain, buried under the vast sea of\nsand. Tranmax's face darkened, secretly\ncalculating what kind of power caused\nthis ancient city to be buried in the\nendless sea of sand. The two slowly\nentered the Jingua ancient city.\nTranmack pointed at a Buddhist statue,\nremarking, \"Looking at the scenery here.\nThis must be a temple used for\nsacrificial rituals. The entrance to the\nancient tomb is right here.\" Seeing this\nscene, Tan said awkwardly, \"The entrance\nto the Jingua Queen's tomb is indeed\nopen. I'm afraid it was done by Tomb\nRaiders. Tranmack immediately affirmed,\n\"Those down there are not Tomb Raiders.\"\nHearing this, he was startled, asking,\n\"What?\" Stepping down the stairs,\nTranmack discovered that there were not\njust the two of them here. There was\nalso Tyan Na, Master Jang, and a\nvenerable monk. Behind them was a group\nof followers. Vinton's son remarked,\n\"Those three ball guys are clearly\nexperts of the esoteric sect. The person\nfollowing that girl is also definitely\nnot ordinary.\" Master Tran. Tranmax\nstared at the large door, touching his\nchin and muttering, \"This door, this\nformation.\" The girl was slightly\nstartled, pointing at them and shouting,\n\"Hey, who are you people? What are you\ndoing here?\" Tramac heard this and asked\nback, \"Then who are you people? What are\nyou doing here?\" She arrogantly\nintroduced herself. I'm the eldest young\nlady Thai van of the Thai family in\nGuandu. Let me tell you, the equinox\nflower here belongs to my Thai family.\nYou You better know your place. Don't\neven think about fighting with me for\nit. Tramac coldly walked past Ty Van Na,\nnot even glancing at her. He walked\ntowards the large door, gently placing\nhis hand on it. The people behind were\nall watching intently. Tramac used force\nto slap the door hard, then looked at\nhis palm and thought, \"It really is like\nthat.\" Seeing Tran Mack unable to do\nanything, Van pointed at him and laughed\nmockingly. This stone door has a\nprotective formation. Even Master Jong\ncouldn't open it. And you want to push\nit open? Are you stupid? Vinton's son\nclenched his fist, shouting, \"Everyone\nstep aside. Let me try.\" Ton's son\nrushed towards the door, determined to\nbreak it. He channeled his strength and\npushed hard, his hand carrying a burst\nof internal energy. But Ton's son was\nimmediately bounced back, falling flat\non his back. What kind of damn formation\ncan bounce me back like this? A\nvenerable monk stepped up and patted his\nshoulder. Brother, the formation on this\ndoor meets force with force. The greater\nthe strength you use, the stronger its\nrebound force. Ty Van Na proposed a\nsolution. Then how do we open this door?\nMaster Jong or should we dig a hole\naround this stone door? Master Jong\nshook his head and said, \"It's useless.\nThe formation covers the entire ancient\ntomb. There are three layers in total.\"\nSuddenly, Tramac raised his hand,\nshouting, \"Open!\" Van Na turned around\nand mocked. \"What have you been doing\nall this time? Do you think this is open\nsesame?\" Saying, \"Open will.\" Suddenly a\nloud noise rang out. Everyone looked\ntowards the door in unison. What the\ndoor? Tranmax smiled secretly thinking.\nThe protective formation of this stone\ndoor is a simplified version of the\nbasic defensive formation of the mystic\nda. This Jingua ancient tomb definitely\nhas a connection to junior sister.\nVinton's son walked closer excitedly.\nMaster tran, how did you open that door\njust now? So amazing with you in this\nancient tomb. I feel much more assured.\nMaster Jang turned to Tyan Na\ninstructing young miss stay close to me.\nShe replied amen. Then he reminded the\npeople behind. Everyone stay close. No\none can guarantee there isn't danger\ninside. Tramac looked up startled. In\nfront of them was a staircase leading to\nanother room. Everyone marveled. I\ndidn't expect there to be such a deep\nplace underground. Oh my god, it's truly\nmagical. Vana na exclaimed. That coffin\nat the very top. Could it be the Jingua\nQueens? Hearing this, Master Jang\nreplied. Perhaps, she asked again. Is\nthe equinox flower inside? Finished\nspeaking, Ty Van Na suddenly rushed\ntowards the stairs. The equinox flower\nmust be inside that ancient white jade\ncoffin. No one fight me for it. Master\nJang shouted anxiously. Don't act\nrashly. Quickly stop the young miss.\nThree men immediately blocked her path.\nYoung miss, don't be impulsive. What if\nthere are traps? One of them said, Young\nMiss, calm down a bit. But before he\nfinished speaking, flames suddenly\nerupted. Engulfed in flames, he let out\na miserable scream. Ah! In extreme pain,\nhe screamed desperately. \"Uh! Ah! Save\nme! Save me!\" Vana was terrified seeing\nthis. She turned and ran, shouting a\nwarning. \"Everyone run! There's danger!\"\nMaster Jon took out a Taii diagram. What\nhappened? Let me see. A shield appeared\naround him. Yet, in such a short time,\nit could burn a person to ashes. What\nexactly is this thing? The fire\ngradually extinguished, leaving only a\nsmall scorch mark. Suddenly, an object\nflew towards Master Jong. He was\nhorrified. What is that? It's a snake.\nTurns out the culprit is it. Master Jang\nthrew a powerful punch at the red snake,\nintending to kill it, but it dodged.\nEveryone screamed in horror. It's\nrushing over. The snake opened its\nmouth, revealing two sharp fangs.\nTranmack reached out his hand. A stream\nof spiritual energy tightly wrapped\naround the snake's head. I didn't expect\nthere to actually be a red-scaled snake\non the Imperial Star. The snake\nretreated a few steps, spitting out a\nmouthful of blood. That person asked,\n\"What is a red-scaled snake?\" Tranmack\nreplied, \"The red-scaled snake is 1 foot\nlong, covered in bright red scales. It\nwill burst into fierce flames upon\nencountering anything.\" Van not doubted,\n\"Is it dead?\" Trax suddenly realized the\nred-scaled snake has another\ncharacteristic, which is that it likes\nto live in groups. Just then, a swarm of\nred snakes was approaching them. Van Na\nwas startled. \"What?\" Master Jang\nshouted. \"Too many. It's very dangerous.\nLet's retreat quickly.\" Someone\nreassured. \"Don't panic. We have many\npeople.\" Someone else urged, \"Run, run,\nrun,\" Tranmax said in a deep voice.\n\"Red-scaled snakes worship the mother\nsnake immensely. As long as we find and\nkill the mother snake, they will retreat\non their own.\" Those red snakes suddenly\nentwined together and a mother snake\ntowered over them. It threatened. You\nhumans dare to disturb my master. Today\nyou all must die. Tranmack replied\ncalmly. Ah, so these small snakes are\nall a part of you, merging together to\nbecome the great mother snake. The\nmother snake roared majestically. Vanas\nstammered in fear. It can speak. It can\nactually speak human language. Truly a\nmonster. Three masters rushed up and\nbegan casting spells. I'm a bddha b\nbeast. Why don't you hurry up and die?\nThat snake was not only unafraid but\nalso breathe fire. Luckily, the masters\ndodged in time otherwise they would have\nlost their lives. The weapons in their\nhands also caught fire. Master Jang\nshouted, \"Quickly, throw away your\nweapons.\" One master saw this, thinking\nawkwardly, \"This strange fire can even\ndestroy magical artifacts.\" He looked at\nhis slightly burned hand, saying,\n\"Indeed, it burns even when meeting\nBuddha. We underestimated the enemy.\nTranmack remained calm. If you guys are\nout of ideas, then step back. Let me\ntry. At this moment, Master Jang threw\nout the Taii diagram, shouting, \"Grandse\nceiling art.\" The mother snake looked\nconfused, not understanding what was\nhappening. He continued to channel\nenergy for talisman flags flew above the\nsnake's head, surrounding the taigi\ndiagram. S. It cried out arrogantly. You\nhave some skill, but wanting to bind me\nis still far from enough. Suddenly, the\nmother snake grew two legs, and a pair\nof horns appeared on its head. It\nmocked, \"Your cultivation is too low.\nDon't even dream of trapping me with\nthis kind of formation.\" Master John's\nformation was immediately destroyed. He\nfell to his knees, spitting out a\nmouthful of fresh blood. This red-scaled\nspirit snake carries the fire flood\ndragon bloodline. It has grown limbs and\ntwo horns. Only the divine realm can\nsubdue it. Young miss, run quickly,\nVanas said. But we haven't got the\nequinox flower yet, he said tremblingly.\nYoung miss, young miss, staying alive is\nmore important. She suddenly exclaimed,\n\"Master Jong, look quickly.\" Trax shot\nup high. He raised his fist wrapped in a\npowerful aura, shouting, \"Heavenly\nmystic divine fist, first form.\" The\nmother snake vigilantly breathed fire.\nTrax still rushed forward, determined\nnot to admit defeat, and he landed a\nheavy punch on its head. Vana was\nhorrified. He actually smashed the giant\nsnake. Master Jon was also dumbfounded.\nThis kid's strength is unfathomable. The\nmother snake spat black blood, breaking\ninto many segments. Tramac thought, \"I\nmust quickly transfer its divine soul.\"\nHe waved his hand, grabbing the snake\nthat was just huge, now turned extremely\nsmall, falling into his palm. Tramac\nlooked at it, smiling and asking, \"You\nhave cultivated a divine soul?\" He\nreassured, \"Don't worry, I won't kill\nyou, and I'll even give you a fortune.\"\nEveryone walked up the stairs. Master\nJong advised. \"Young miss, don't be so\nimpulsive. Maybe there are other\ndangers.\" Ty Van Na ignored him,\ngreedily, declaring, \"The equinox flower\nis mine. It must be in this queen's\ncoffin.\" She ordered, \"Men, open the\ncoffin for me.\" She didn't listen to\nadvice, immediately opening the coffin\nlid. Everyone leaned in to look,\nexclaiming in surprise. Tyana saw that\nit was empty inside, screaming in\nastonishment, \"Why is it empty inside?\"\nHer face turned pale, asking\nsuspiciously, \"Where is the equinox\nflower? Where's my equinox flower?\" A\nmaster discovered something strange,\nsaying, \"Look at that piece of cloth.\nThe clothes have all turned to ash, yet\nit is perfectly intact.\" He picked up\nthe cloth and read, saying, \"This is a\nsheepkin scroll written in ancient\nWestern region script.\" Then the master\nread the content aloud. An earthquake\ndestroyed the spiritual route. This\nplace is no longer habitable. I want to\nlead my people to a new world. Hearing\nthis, the other masters were all\nconfused and asked curiously, \"Spiritual\nroute? What is a spiritual route? And\nwhere is the new world?\" Master Jang\nexplained, \"The spiritual route might be\nthe underground river.\" After the\nearthquake, mountains blocked the\nunderground river, cutting off the water\nsource. So the Jingua kingdom could no\nlonger survive. The older master also\nsaid the content that follows is obscure\nand hard to understand. The mystic\npalace has flaws. Return to the\nnetherworld. Open the seven apertures.\nReach the heavens. Merge with the cycle.\nSuddenly Tranmax eyes widened in\nsurprise, thinking, \"This is a modified\nversion of the mystic dao sex\ncultivation method. Could the Jingu\nqueen be a disciple of my junior\nsister?\" Tranmack immediately stepped\nback to ponder. If that is the case,\nthen the spiritual route is definitely\nnot a water source. It might be right\nnearby. Suddenly, a thought flashed\nthrough his mind. Why did the Jingu\nqueen place her coffin here? Could it\nbe? Then Tramac punched the ground with\ngreat force, creating a huge pit. From\nunderground, a piece of wood lying there\ncould be seen. Master Jang and Ty Van Na\nwere shaken by the impact and could\nbarely stand. She asked, \"What\nhappened?\" Master Jong warned, \"Miss, be\ncareful.\" From underground, a large\npiece of wood as tall as an adult rose\nup. Tranmack revealed the look of as\nexpected, thinking, \"Indeed, this is the\nroot of the innate spiritual wood.\" The\ninnate spiritual root of the Jingu\nkingdom was destroyed by the earthquake.\nThen it absorbed the heaven and earth\norigin energy within a thousand miles to\nheal itself, turning the Jingu kingdom\ninto ruins. Master Jang saw the innate\nspiritual woodroot, stepped back\nwearily, and exclaimed in awe, \"This\nthing possesses an immense life force.\nMy internal injuries are recovering\nrapidly.\" The purple-haired middle-aged\nman also lamented, \"If I could cultivate\nhere, within a year, I could break\nthrough to become a transformation realm\nGrandmaster.\" Seeing this, Master John\nadvised Van Na, \"Miss, if we can bring\nthis back and place it beside the old\nmaster, his illness will surely be cured\ncompletely.\" She was overjoyed, but her\nhappiness didn't last long before a new\nproblem arose. Really? That's great. But\nhow we bring it back? Master Jang\nimmediately pulled out a knife and said,\n\"We don't necessarily have to take it\nall. A piece will suffice.\" However,\nwhen he tried to cut a piece off, the\nknife immediately snapped in half. He\ncried out in surprise, \"What?\" He asked\nhimself in disbelief, \"How is this\npossible?\" Seeing this, Tranmack\nexplained, \"The innate spiritual root is\nimpervious to water and fire and\nextremely hard. It is absolutely\nimpossible for you to cut it.\" Despite\nthis, Vanas still stubbornly insisted,\n\"No matter what, I must take this back\nto cure my grandfather's illness.\" So,\nTranmack stepped forward and suggested,\n\"If you only want to treat an illness\nand save a person, then one pill is\nenough.\" Tramac handed her a golden\npill. she asked curiously. \"Is this\nperhaps?\" Master Jang also stepped\nforward to inspect. \"Let me see.\" In an\ninstant, they were all stunned. A\ntop-grade spiritual medicine. He happily\ntold the young lady, \"This pill is\nenough to cure the old master's\nillness.\" Hearing this, Van hesitated a\nbit and asked, \"Really? Such a precious\npill. Are you really willing to give it\nto me?\" As expected, wasn't that easy.\nTranmax stated his condition. Of course,\nI won't give you this pill for free. I\nwant half of the Thai family's assets.\nThis proposal was unbelievable. Van\nasked angrily, \"Half? Why don't you go\nrob someone?\" Hearing the answer,\nTranmack took back the golden pill and\nsaid, \"It seems you don't want to cure\nyour grandfather. Then you all leave.\nDon't get any ideas about the innate\nspiritual route. Otherwise, don't blame\nme for being ungracious.\" Finally, Venar\nreluctantly agreed. \"Fine, I agree with\nyou.\" In her heart, she calculated,\n\"I'll get the pill first. As for the\nassets, I won't give them anyway, and\nyou can't rob me. While the master\nclosed his eyes to pray, Tranmack handed\nthe girl in front of him a white bottle\nand said, \"Take it. This bottle is\nenough.\" Ty Van Na immediately took it,\ncheering happily. Grandfather is saved.\nBefore she could finish rejoicing, Tran\nMack sternly ordered, \"Your goal has\nbeen achieved. Leave here immediately.\"\nMaster Jong saw Tranmack turn around and\nalso said to the young lady, \"Miss,\nlet's go back. Hana.\nThe blue-haired man beside them suddenly\nclasped his hands and bowed to Tranmack,\nasking politely, \"Thank you, Master\nTran. I must return.\" \"Master, do you\nstill have matters to attend to?\"\nTransmac indifferently brushed off the\nothers concern, replying coldly. Don't\nask too many questions. I want to stay\nhere for a while. Your mission is\ncomplete. Go quickly. Tranmax sharp\ngazed and shifted toward the green mist\nin front of him. Tranmax mind yearned.\nThis innate spiritual route is enough\nfor me to cultivate the wood element\nbody to perfection. Half a month later,\nin front of the endless steps of the\nDowist temple, countless men holding\nhoes were digging for something with all\ntheir might. Noisy sounds echoed. Dig\nhere, dig a bit deeper. Tran Mack, who\nwas meditating inside, was immediately\nawakened. Tranmack opened his eyes to\nlook around, frowned, and cast a spell,\nangrily scolding the people below,\nreckless fools. A streak of azure light\nimmediately obeyed the command, knocking\nthe men away and causing them to roll\ndown the stairs. Ta stood by watching\nthose people roll down like rocks and\nscreamed in horror, \"Ah!\" As soon as\nTran heard her voice, he said with\nannoyance, \"You truly have an insatiable\ngreed.\" Tyan nod did not back down,\nloudly, retorting to Tranmack, \"The\ninnate spiritual route is so long, yet\nyou want to monopolize it alone, and you\nhave the nerve to lecture me.\" Master\nJang beside her also unceremoniously\npointed at Tranmack and bargained.\nEveryone who sees the innate spiritual\nroute has a share. Give me half and I\ndefinitely won't make things difficult\nfor you. Tranmack said disdainfully. You\nare not yet qualified to rob things from\nmy hands. Tramac the old man being\nlooked down upon was furious and\nimmediately took out his book to\nthreaten. Then go die. Master Jang\ndidn't say another word directly\nchanting a spell. Spirit of the earth\nveins heeded my command following his\nchant. Many small rocks flew up from the\nground into the air surrounding him.\nMaster Jon pointed at Tramac decisively\nordering giant stone dragon tornado\nunexpectedly as those rocks rushed\ntoward Tranmack. They transformed into a\nferocious giant dragon. Tranmax seemed\nto dislike being threatened and his face\nimmediately filled with displeasure.\nSuddenly, Tranax smiled calmly and\nbrilliant lights sparkled around him. As\nthe light flashed, the giant stone\ndragon shattered, turning back into\nuseless stones. Master Jang laughed\nmockingly upon seeing this, loudly,\nscorning Tranmax power. Brat, do you\nwant to rely on defensive artifacts to\nhold out again? Haha, truly seeking your\nown death. The dust from the explosion\ncleared and a pair of sturdy legs\nstepped out from the smoke. Seeing\nTransmax safe and sound, his expression\neven more arrogant and unruly than\nbefore, Master Jong exclaimed in\ndisbelief, \"What? He didn't die? Is this\nbrat even human?\" He gritted his teeth\nand muttered, \"But I still have one more\nmove. Let's see how you block this.\" His\nmalicious eyes stared at Tramac, saying,\n\"You definitely can't block this move.\"\nAll living things returned to dust.\nEarth burial. Unexpectedly, as soon as\nhe pointed at the book, the ground\nbeneath Tranmax's feet cracked open into\na huge pit, swallowing him inside.\n\"Close!\" a loud shout, and the pit\nimmediately closed tight. Master Jon was\necstatic, his voice trembling. \"De.\" But\nbefore he could finish his sentence,\nTranmack had protected his body and\nbroke through the ground, flying up\nunharmed. The old man was dumbfounded.\nHow is that possible? Tranmack landed\nlightly, smiling contemptuously at the\nold man. Any other moves? Let me attack.\nBeing mocked by a brat to this extent,\nMaster Jong's face turned black. He\nfrowned and said decisively, \"I'll fight\nyou to the death, spirit of the great\nearth. He my command, Earth Fiend,\ndescend.\" Having said that, he tore his\nclothes apart, transforming into a\ngiant. His whole body covered with sharp\nrocks, blinding light shooting out in\nall directions. Master Jong roared in\nfury, unceremoniously rushing forward.\nNow that I have merged with the great\nearth, as long as I stand on this land,\nI can receive power continuously and\nendlessly. In the crowd, a young man saw\nthis scene and screamed, trembling, \"Oh\nmy God, Master Jong has turned into a\nmonster.\" Ty Van Na immediately pointed\nat him and scolded, leaving him with a\nbitter smile. \"Idiot! Master Jang is\ncasting a spell. Don't disturb him. Over\nhere, Master Jong was still attacking\nTramac. He raised his fist\nthreateningly. Brat prepared to die.\nBefore he could finish gloating, his\ngiant hand was neatly severed by a\nstreak of green light. The old man\nhowled in pain, his brows furrowed\ntight. But just a moment later, the\nsevered arm gradually regenerated amidst\nMaster Jong's joy. He laughed\ntriumphantly. Huh? Just as I said, as\nlong as I stand on this land, I am an\ninvincible existence. Tranmack didn't\ncare at all. continuing to cast his\nspell and calmly replied, \"In that case,\nfive elements forbidden art.\" Master\nJang still rushed forward, but Tramax's\nformation had appeared, blocking the\nattack in the nick of time. The old man\nimmediately screamed in panic, \"No, I\ncan't absorb the earth elements anymore.\nWhat is going on?\" Tranm didn't say\nanother word, coldly ordering, \"Heaven\nslashing sword, rise.\" The sword wrapped\nin brilliant golden light immediately\nobeyed its master's command, tearing\nthrough the wind. A fierce gale swept\nthrough heaven and earth. At this\nmoment, only the blinding light of the\nheaven slashing sword remained. Under\nTranmax in different gaze, Master Jang's\nbody was humiliatingly chopped into\nseveral segments. Afterward, his body\nturned back into heavy boulders and fell\nto the ground.\nAlthough Jang suddenly Tran Mack walked\ntoward them, scared her so much her\nvoice cracked. Tran Tranac after a\nmoment of shock, she immediately waved\nher hands, cutting ties with the old\nman. Sorry, Master Jong forced me to\ncome. It has nothing to do with me.\nTranmack seemed unbothered, waving his\nhand to dismiss them. If not for the\nfact that I owe you a favor, you would\nbe dead. Get lost. Receiving the\namnesty, Tyan Na and the men immediately\nran away. say obediently, \"Yes, yes,\nwe're leaving right away.\" Escaping\nTranmax hellish place, the group panted\nheavily. One of them asked, \"Miss,\nMaster Jong is dead. How do we get the\ninnate spiritual route?\" Ty Van N\nshouted, \"Do you think I'm dead? That\nkid is too strong. Who could snatch\nthings from his hands?\" But the corners\nof her mouth curled up into a vicious\nsmile, whispering a scheme. \"Even if I\ncan't get the item, I can't let him have\nit so easily.\" Night fell in the VP\nlounge. Ty Van Na held her phone.\nseemingly making a call. A voice rang\nout from the other end. \"Miss, all the\ninformation about him has been sent to\nyour phone,\" she muttered as she looked\nthrough Tranmax's personal information.\nGrandmaster Tran of Ken Angle my group\nlife spirit liquid Tran family in Guon.\nWait, being so arrogant, he surely has\nmany enemies. Suddenly her expression\nchanged her face full of disbelief.\nSpread the news that Grandmaster Tran of\nKinep has died in the sea of death. Ty\nVan Na's face immediately filled with\ncalculation. Grandmaster Tran, when you\ncome out and see your relatives and\nfriends harmed by your enemies, what\nkind of expression will you have? Huh?\nTime passed half a month later in a\nbrightly lit private room with beauties\nlike clouds. So Van Hung was drunkenly\nenjoying himself, ordering, \"Keep the\nmusic playing. Keep dancing.\" Just as he\nwas happily dancing, a bald old man\nsuddenly pushed the door open in anger\nand walked in. The infatuation on his\nface not yet faded. So Van Hung asked in\nconfusion, \"Who is it?\" Tan Kuang Hi did\nnot answer, but clenched his fist\nthreateningly. \"So Van Hung, I give you\nthree days. Call out all of Grandmaster\nTR wings here, otherwise I will kill you\nall.\" So Van Hung and the models heard\nhim say this and instantly sobered up.\nSo Van Hungurly reassured him. Big\nbrother, don't be impulsive. If there's\nsomething, let's talk slowly. I'll just\ndo as you say. Hoing\nhai. Immediately turned and left,\nleaving a sentence. A piece of trash\nlike he knows the times. So Van Hung\nlooked at his lonely back thinking, \"Is\nthis an enemy? Could the news that\nGrandmaster Tran is dead be true?\" At\nthe same time inqin ang district the\nchairman's office of ho my group on tin\nand lie to fuang were seriously\ndiscussing work. A steady voice rang out\nregarding the next new project. It must\nbe resolved like this before the words\nwere finished. A loud noise from outside\ninterrupted them. Lidang asked alertly\nwho a stranger suddenly kicked the door\nopen and rushed in holding a patterned\nsword in his hand. He bared his teeth\nthreateningly. Chairman Lie, prepare to\ngo to the west. Saying that, he drew his\nsword and rushed towards Lie to Fuang,\nshouting, \"Die.\" To lie to Fuang's\nastonishment, a green light suddenly\nappeared, blocking the attacker's\nstrike. Tran Tongue Tu grabbed the\nassassin's hand in time. Tran Tongue Tu\ndid not say a second word. Grabbed the\nperson by the collar and asked sternly,\n\"Who sent you?\" The person's face\nimmediately turned pale. The assassin\nexplained in panic, \"I I don't know. I\nonly know that after the job is done, I\nwill receive a top grade spirit pill.\nTran tongue too did not hesitate.\nStrangled him and said coldly, then you\nhave no value. The assassin rolled his\neyes and fell to the ground, seemingly\ndead on looked extremely worried,\ntimidly saying to lie to Fuang. This is\nalready the third assassination attempt\nrecently. Chairman, she appeared very\ncalm, casually speaking her thoughts. It\nmust be the Van family. Hearing rumors\nthat my son is dead, they constantly\nplay tricks. So sooner or later, he will\nhave to pay the price. The city was\nbrilliant with lights at night. In a\ngrand mansion, Tan Kuang High sat\narrogantly on a large share. In front of\nhim was a group of people so scared they\ndared not move. The bald old man\nthreatened loudly, \"Hand over all your\nassets and the production line of Life\nSpirit Liquid.\" Whispers immediately\narose. Everyone turned their eyes to so\nvan hung waiting for him to resolve this\nmatter. He stammered in reply. This sigh\nin his heart he thought no amount of\nassets is as important as the life\nspirit liquid. Tan Kuang Hai gritted his\nteeth in anger scaring so van hung to\ndeath. What don't want to talk? Want to\ndie? He dared not answer and could only\nhelplessly close his eyes. The sky was\nclear. On a swaying suspension bridge, a\ngroup of people walked wearily towards\nthe other shore. Although Tan Kuangghai\nwas old, he was extremely excited about\nthis trip. His eyes shining. He laughed\nsmuggly at his achievements. While so\nVan Hung sighed helplessly, unexpectedly\nbefore he could be happy for long, a\nfemale voice interrupted his beautiful\ndream. Who dares to come here and cause\ntrouble? Get out quickly, otherwise\ndon't blame me for being impolite. Yin\nQuinn Tan and Tang Tang stood in front\nof them, their faces full of contempt.\nTan Kuang Hai angrily chased him away.\nWatchd dogs, don't block my way. A black\nshadow suddenly flashed past, only to\nsee the old man raising his fist and\nrushing towards Tang Tang. A panicked\nshout echoed in the room. Careful. A\nsword blocked in front of the old man in\ntime.\nYou have some skill. Who is your master?\nYanquent answered seriously. Old man,\nyou're not qualified to ask. Saying that\nher whole body seemed to be lifted by\nPhoenix wings, flying into the air,\nexecuting the move phoenix dancing in\nthe nine heavens. Tan Kuangghai laughed\nand evaluated. Your sore move is very\nstrong. Fortunately, you are only at the\npeak of the internal realm. If you\nstepped into the transformation realm, I\nwouldn't be able to beat you either.\nThen he threw a powerful palm towards\nher, shouting, \"Great Origin, returning\nhand.\" Two moves collided, neither\ngiving way to the other. A moment later,\nYin Quinton exclaimed, \"What?\" A loud\nexplosion rang out, knocking her away.\nThe girl scream echoed. \"Ah!\" Yin Quinn\nTon lay in the ruins. Next to her was\nTang Tang asking anxiously, \"Miss.\" She\nreplied, \"I'm fine. Let's run quickly.\"\nTan Kuang Hai stood outside and said,\n\"H, damn bunch running really fast.\" The\nluxurious mansion was now covered in the\nbeautiful glow of the setting sun. Tan\nKuang Hai stood in the house laughing\nloudly. He he from now on everything\nhere belongs to me. I will move the Ulam\nsect here. In no more than a few years,\nmy Ulam sect can dominate the martial\narts world. It turned out he was the\nsect master of Yulamsek, the senior\nbrother of Vinton's son. At another\nplace, the old Daoist was grabbing\nmedicine for the weak Yin Quinton. This\nis the origin nurturing pill. Take it to\nheal your injuries. He asked\nsuspiciously what exactly happened. Tang\nTang was also scratched by the\nexplosion, she explained. So Van Hungs\ngroup brought a martial arts\ngrandmaster, broke the mist formation,\nand occupied the villa on the\nmountaintop. Tran tongue too pondered\nfor a moment, making a decision. So Van\nHung's group are all ordinary people.\nI'm afraid they did this to protect\nthemselves, not voluntarily leading the\nway. Now our most important task is to\nprotect the safety of the chairman.\nOther matters can wait until master\nreturns. Hawkdong Min stumbled, his\nfootsteps heavy, tiredly saying to\nhimself, \"They probably won't catch up\nnow.\" He collapsed to the ground,\nclutching his chest tightly. A mouthful\nof thick black blood gushing from his\nmouth. He muttered in surprise, \"Black\nblood?\" Turns out I was poison long ago.\nSuddenly, two men with strange\nappearances appeared in front of him.\nThe two used different expressions to\nsay in unison, \"Your body has long been\nmarked by the god of death by Sir Hart,\nand most you can only live for five more\nminutes.\" Hakdong Min was stunned for a\nfew seconds. Immediately raised his head\nto face them and replied firmly, \"Even\nif I die, I will drag you down as a\ncushion.\" The vampire Jon immediately\nlaughed mockingly, revealing four sharp\nfangs and said, \"Oh God, you want to\nrisk your life against us. So scary.\" He\nlicked his lips in satisfaction. Tasting\nthe blood of your two companions has\ngiven me great power. I believe your\nblood will definitely be even more\nwonderful. Hot Dong Min couldn't bear it\nanymore. Roared in anger, \"Two damn\nvampires. I'll fight you to the death.\"\nSaying that, he swung a fist towards a\nhateful face. Unexpectedly, the opponent\nquickly teleported behind him before the\nfist could touch. The person provoked\ncontemptuously, too slow. Currently,\nhotong men had all escape routes blocked\nby the two vampires. Jean opened his\nmouth and said, \"I think you shouldn't\nresist in vain. Die early and be\nreincarnated early.\" The dark mage char,\neyes red, excitedly cast a spell,\nsaying, \"I'll send you on your way.\"\nBone attaching demon. Hot Dong Min\nseemed to have completely given up,\nmuttering in self-reroach, unexpectedly\nsacrificing all teammates. In the end,\nstill unable to bring the news back.\nJust at this moment, a giant blade\ndescended from sky, cutting a path,\nseparating Hawkdong men and them. The\ntwo vampires screamed in panic. What?\nJ's face turned pale, asking\nsuspiciously, \"What the hell is this\nthing?\" His arm suddenly severed,\ncausing him to exclaim, \"Damn it, my\narm.\" To Hot Dong Min's horror, the\nblade still radiated pure light. Jon\nshouted while healing himself, frowning.\nEven if I can recover my body, it still\nhurts a lot. Bastard, who ambushed us?\nConversely, Char seemed to have\nunderstood something. He hesitated to\nspeak. This looks like the flying sword\nin Eastern mythology. Unexpectedly, the\nblades split the ground. A familiar\nfigure flew up from it. Jon said\nsuspiciously, \"What happened again?\"\nTramac didn't bother to pay attention to\nthem, just talking to himself. Turns out\nthere are descendants of the blood race\nhere, but the bloodline is not pure,\njust hybrids. Char heard this degrading\nremark and laughed loudly. \"Haha, Jon,\nhe is cursing you.\" Jon roared in anger.\n\"Shut up!\" Not letting the opponent wait\nlong. Tranmack continued to throw out\nheavy contempt. Being human yet\nsacrificing your soul to alien gods. You\nare not worthy of being human. Char was\nscolded to his face. Momentarily tongue\ntied. You. Jon glanced gloatingly at his\ncompanion. Char. Did you hear that? He\nsaid you're not human. This time it was\nChar's turn to roar. Shut up. At this\nmoment, Hot Dong Min's voice interrupted\nthe drama. Brother, are you a person for\nHasha? I have a favor to ask you after\nyou return to Hashia. Please take this\nbadge to find Duong Denten. Tell him. In\nHawkdong men's hand was a very majestic\neagle-shaped badge. He continued, \"The\ndeath organization has begun\nassassinating martial arts experts of\nHashia. Tell him to be careful and guard\ninside and out.\" The badge was thrown\nover. Tranmack quickly caught it and\nguaranteed, \"Okay.\" But Tranmax suddenly\nturned his head to look at the two,\ncalculating thoughtfully. However, these\ntwo thorns in front of my eyes cannot\nremain unplucked. Hearing these words,\nthe two immediately restored their\nprevious viciousness. A gleam of malice\nflashed in Char's eyes, saying,\n\"Arrogant brat, I must kill both of\nyou.\" He decisively raised his hands\nhigh, praying sincerely, \"Great God of\ndarkness, please listen to the summons\nof your most loyal servant. Grant me the\npower of darkness.\" A stream of pitch\nblack power condensed in his hands. Char\nwaved his hand, throwing an energy ball\ntowards Tranmack, shouting, \"Die!\" Just\nat the critical moment when Tran Mack\nwas preparing to counterattack.\nUnexpectedly, Hawkdong men rushed out to\nshield him, shouting in panic. \"Brother,\nretreat quickly.\" Tran was only slightly\nsurprised, then immediately raised his\nhand to cast a spell, a sphere of light\nenveloping and protecting him inside.\nChar did not expect this. He asked in\nastonishment, \"Defens of magic? You're a\nmage?\" Jon immediately rushed forward,\narrogantly threatening, \"Watch me smash\nthis turtle shell of yours.\" He landed a\nheavy punch on the protective barrier,\nbut remained unscathed. Unresigned, he\ncontinuously threw powerful punches.\nTranmack gradually revealed a look of\ndisdain, telling him, \"Even if I gave\nyou a hundred years, you wouldn't be\nable to break it. But I don't want to\nwaste time. Go!\" Tranm shouted softly,\nand the blade from earlier flew up\namidst Jon's horror. He cried out,\n\"What?\" Right at that moment, the blade\nwhistled past. Fortunately, he dodged in\ntime, but the target of the blade was\nthe one standing behind him. Char was\nstabbed in the chest, yet he still said\narrogantly, \"I am the most loyal servant\nof the god of darkness, \"My body is\nimmortal. This attack cannot kill me.\"\nHowever, thick black blood flowed from\nhis wound, unable to heal. Only then did\nhe scream in panic, \"No, no, how will my\nwound heal?\" Tranmack then snapped his\nfingers, saying, \"Burn!\" The blade\nimmediately burst into flames, burning\nthe mage alive. Under J's gaze, screams\nof miserable pain echoed, \"Ah! Uh!\"\nChar's body was quickly burnt to\ncharcoal. He died with eyes wide open.\nJ's face turned pale, and he shouted in\ndisbelief, \"Char, how is this possible?\"\nHot Dong Min looked at Trax and back. He\ncalculated silently. This young man\ncould easily kill a rank six dark\nwizard, an existence equivalent to a\ntransformation realm grandmaster.\nTranmax suddenly opened his mouth to\nexplain to him to deal with this kind of\nrotten person who has abandon their soul\nand flesh. The best method is to use\nfire attribute trueqi destroying his\nbody. The guy named Jon after his\naccomplice was dealt with roared madly.\nYou killed Char. You dared to kill Char.\nI want to suck your blood dry. Turn you\ninto my slave. He leapt powerfully into\nthe air. Tramax scornfully spat. Too\nmuch talk. Having said that, a ray of\nlight flashed, unexpectedly chopping off\none of Jon's arms. The entire arm\nquickly fell to the ground. However, Jon\nstill said with full confidence, even if\nyour flying sword is faster, it cannot\nkill me. I am of the immortal blood\nrace.\" His severed arm was seen quickly\nrestoring to its original state. Hot\nDong Men gritted his teeth and said,\n\"The vitality of the blood race is\nextremely strong. Unless the heart is\npierced, you basically cannot kill him.\nThat mixed blood guy looked triumphant,\nloudly provoking.\" The hearts of us\nblood race and humans are completely\ndifferent. If you want to attack, find\nit first then talk. Tranmack paid no\nheed. The heaven slashing sword was\nalready spinning in the air. Trax's\nvoice cut him off. You are wrong. Before\nJon could react, the heavens slashing\nsword had neatly severed his limbs. But\nthis time, his body not only could not\nrecover, but on the contrary, raging\nflames also rose up. Jean screamed in\ndisbelief. This how is this possible? My\nbody cannot recover anymore. I am dying.\nTranmax simply explained, \"The blood\nrace is not immortal, and the weakness\nis not the heart either. The method to\nkill them is to create damage exceeding\nthe limit of what they can endure. Then\nhe turned around handing the bwa plate\nto Hawkdong Min saying it's better if\nyou deliver this thing to Duong Dentian\nand yourself. At this moment, Hawkdong\nMin revealed his frailty. He choked out,\n\"Too late. I was injured too heavily\nalong the way. I can't live.\" After\nspeaking, he collapsed, still muttering,\n\"Brothers, I'm coming.\" Seeing this,\nTramac also fell into deep thought. Just\nbecause I am a person of Hasha, you\ncould trust me unconditionally like\nthat. After thinking, he decisively\nleft, arranging his next journey. First,\na trip back to Saitang. Suddenly, Tranax\npupils contracted sharply, filled with\nhorror. He thought in panic. I sense the\nformation exploding. Mom and sister\nAnne's protective jade pendant broke. A\ncar accident had just occurred. A sedan\nwas knocked flying to the roadside.\nAlthough lie to Fuang and on Tin\nrecovered in injuries, it was nothing\nserious. Lie defang asked in confusion.\nLittle Tin, I didn't expect us to be\nalive. On Tin knelt to one side, calling\nsoftly, chairman. Lie to Fuang suddenly\ncried out in joy. The jade pendant is\ngone. It was the jade pendant little Mac\ngave that saved us. Anton also said\ngratefully, little Mac is truly\nthoughtful. That night at the police\nstation, Tranmack forcefully pushed the\ndoor open, shouting loudly, \"Mom,\" the\ntwo people giving statements turned\ntheir heads in surprise. Lie to Fuang\ncried out happily. Little Mac, you're\nback. Sure enough, the rumors of your\ndeath were just rumors. Tranmack's face\nwas still written with worry. He asked\nuneasily. It's good that you are fine. I\nsense the protective jade pendant on you\nexploding. What happened? On lowered her\nhead to look at the remaining string,\nsimply recounting what just happened.\nSister and the chairman were preparing\nto go to Dut Trung to attend the group's\nnew project establishment ceremony. Just\nnow on the highway, we met with a car\naccident. Luckily, the jade pendant you\ngave saved us. Tramax stroked his chin\nin thought. Rumors that I died. Galaxy.\nThe chairman's office of the van\ncorporation. Van nose. Slammed the table\nin anger, roaring loudly. The entire\nMercedes was crushed. Yet the people are\nfine. Absurd standing before him. Van\nVan Hugh was equally angry. He said\nhatefully. Tranmack must have left them\nsome powerful treasure taking this hit\nfor them. Van Trong no suddenly looked\nup and asked, \"Is a truck driver dealt\nwith cleanly?\" Van Van Hugh replied\nproudly, \"Dad, of course, no one could\ntrace us.\" Tranmax suddenly appeared,\nsaying coldly, \"Of course, no one could\ntrace either how you people will die\nnext.\" Van no screamed in panic, \"You're\nnot dead.\" Tranmax smirked. \"Very\ndisappointed, aren't you?\" The old fox\nrecovered his composure, frowning.\n\"You're right. Too many people want you\ndead.\" Tranmack didn't say another word,\nasking directly. That car accident was\nplanned by you, right? But the old man\nstill pretended to deny it. I don't\nunderstand what you were saying. Anger\nreached its peak. Tranmack said word by\nword, not admitting it doesn't matter. I\nhave plenty of methods. Seeing this\nappearance of Tranmack, Vanong no\ncouldn't help but retreat in fear,\npointing at him and threatening. What do\nyou want to do? This is a society ruled\nby law. You are a person of the martial\narts world. You cannot interfere in\nsecular matters. Tranmax gaze swept over\nhim like a knife, decisively refuting.\nIf you dare to harm my family, you must\nbear the consequences. Having said that,\na ray of green light flashed and one of\nVan Trong nose fingers flew into the\nair. He screamed in panic. What? Tranmax\nfury continued. He roared. I will let\nyou witness with your own eyes the Van\nfamily's three clans dying completely\nbefore you. Under Van Truong nose\nastonished gaze. Tramac raised his hand\nto form a seal. Bloodline soul pursued\narray. Activate. Exterminate the three\nclans. Dazzling golden light radiated\nfrom the formation. Dark red spreading\nthroughout the room. Wherever the light\nwent, relatives of the Van family\nappeared from the void. Not a single\nperson missing. Vantron note trembled\nsaying, \"Uncle, cousin, all our Van\nfamily people.\" In an instant, flames\nrose up, burning their clothes and\nflesh, and the first person was Van Van\nHugh. Screams of miserable pain echoed.\nEveryone within the formation twisted\nand groaned in agony. Uh uh. Van Van\nHugh cried out for help in panic. Ah,\ndad. Dad, save me. Vantron, no knelt on\nthe ground at this moment, begging\nTranmack for mercy. Stop. I beg you.\nHearing these words, Tranmack felt even\nmore pain in his heart, directly\nexposing their past crimes. In the past\nlife, your van family caused my mother's\ndeath, causing my father to die of\ngrief, forcing on Tin to hang herself if\nI hadn't by chance been taken away by\nthe Dongwa mortal emperor. I would have\nalso been forced by you people to jump\nfrom a building. Van no at this moment\nonly wanted to beg for forgiveness.\nCowtowing madly. Tranmac, stop quickly.\nI am willing to do whatever you want me\nto do. However, the flames of hatred\nultimately spread to his body. Screams\nof misery exploded within the firelight.\nAh uh witnessing with his own eyes the\nenemies who once exterminated his whole\nfamily meeting this end. Tramac finally\nlet go of his obsession, muttering to\nhimself in a days, \"Van family, the\nblood debt you owed me today is paid in\nfull.\" In a quiet late night, the Van\nCorporation skyscraper erupted in a\ngreat fire. Various news immediately\nexploded and spread. Van Corporation\nskyscraper on fire. That building\nburned, too. I only know their family\nhas a young master. Just now, he\nspontaneously combusted mysteriously.\nTruly terrifying. The entire Van family\nsuddenly died completely. Hot search,\nself- emilation, divine punishment,\napocalypse. Hot news. Van Corporation\nskyscraper mysteriously catches fire.\nChairman missing in the room.\nDiscussions arose everywhere. The\nchairman of Ho My Group just had a car\naccident and the van family has been\nexterminated. Understand? It was\nGrandmaster TR lied to Fuang thought\nwith a headache. She said this time\nlittle Mac has caused a big disaster\nwith such a huge commotion. The\ngovernment will definitely intervene.\nNext, she suddenly thought of something.\nImmediately ordering little Tin, you go\nget passports immediately at any cost as\nfast as possible. Then transfer all\nexisting funds to a Swiss bank account.\nOnin momentarily didn't understand, but\nstill replied, \"Yes.\" She turned to\nleave, also promising, \"I will go find\nLil Mac right now.\" However, having just\nopened the door, Tranmack walked in,\nasking with a bewildered expression,\n\"You are panicking like this, what are\nyou doing?\" Lie to Fuang said anxiously,\n\"You still ask. Follow me quickly or it\nwill be too late.\" Anton also said\nhesitantly, \"Little Mac, this time we\ndefinitely must go.\" Tranmax seemed to\nhave understood. He lowered his head and\nsaid, \"Don't be afraid. I will resolve\neverything.\" Lie to Fuang asked angrily.\n\"This child, how will you resolve it?\"\nHe asked his mother in return. \"Mom, can\nyou trust me?\" She reluctantly agreed.\n\"All right, but you must promise me\nabsolutely do not confront the\ngovernment.\" Tramac replied confidently,\n\"I understand.\" Yen Qui Oila missed\nlingered. Tan Kuang Hai was sitting\ncross-legged cultivating. He thought to\nhimself, \"I move the entire Ulam sect\nhere. Yet the spiritual energy shows no\nsigns of thinning. This place is indeed\na precious land of Fongue.\" Suddenly, a\ncommotion came from outside. He\nimmediately became alert, sensing\nsomething was wrong. Tan Kuang Hai ran\nout to check only to see a huge\nexplosion occur in front of him.\nTranmack coldly walked up and\nquestioned, taking advantage of my\nabsence to occupy my villa. Now even if\nyou cowed out and apologize, it is too\nlate. He saw Tramac and asked\nsuspiciously, \"You are.\" Then he laughed\ncontemptuously. Ridiculous. Only\nsuperior people can enjoy better\ncultivation resources. You, a brat who\nis still wet behind the ears. Dare to\ncall yourself Grandmaster Tran? Vinton's\nson ran out from inside asking, \"What\nhappened? An enemy arrived? Is an\nassassin?\" He was also startled,\nexclaiming, \"My god, it turns out\nGrandmaster TR is alive.\" Next, Vinton's\nson advised Tan Kuang Hai, senior\nbrother. Since Grandmaster TR isn't\ndead, let's go quickly. After advising,\nhe turned to Tran Mack, smiling.\nGrandmaster TR, we were deceived by\nrumors. Please let us go. We will leave\nimmediately. Bhutan Guang Hai at\nVintang, you ingrate. He pointed\nforcefully at Tranmack asking, \"Do you\nthink I will lose to this brat?\" But\nVinon's son seemed very firm. He\nretorted, \"Senior brother, I am saving\nare you lamb sect? You cannot imagine\nGrandmaster Tran strength. Regardless of\nwhat Vinton's son said, Tan Kuang Hai\nstill did not believe it.\" He jumped up\nangrily. \"Enough.\" He announced loudly.\nOnly the survivor is qualified to own\nthis place. Saying so, he unleashed a\nmove at the three great origin turtle\nhand. Tang Tang warned, \"Be careful.\" He\nused this move to defeat Miss before,\nbut Tranmack calmly walked forward,\nreplying, \"Just this little skill.\" He\nraised his hand to counter, blocking the\nopponent's move. A loud bang. An\nexplosion occurred. Vinton's son was\nknocked back, wondering curiously, \"Such\nstrong power. What is the result?\" Smoke\nfilled the villa courtyard. The result\nwas decided. Tan Kuang Hai lay\nunconscious on the ground while Tranmac\nstood there steadily. He said, \"Victory\nand defeat are decided.\" The disciples\nwere stunned, staring wideeyed. Master\nactually lost in one move. Vinton's son\nalso stared wideeyed, mouth agape,\ncompared to when dealing with the\nred-scaled snakes in the underground\npalace. Grandmaster Tran is much more\npowerful. Yin Quinton thought\nuncomfortably. I thought my desperate\nefforts were catching up to him.\nUnexpectedly, the gap is getting bigger.\nTan Kuangghai's disciples immediately\nknelt, begging for mercy. Grandmaster\nTR, spare our lives. We didn't come\nvoluntarily. Vinton son repeatedly\nexplained, \"My senior brother has been\ndefeated. Please raise your hand high\nand strike gently. Spare my disciples\nlives. I swear from now on, my Ulam sect\nis willing to follow Grandmaster Tran.\"\nTranmack raised an eyebrow. If there is\na next time, I absolutely will not show\nmercy. Thank you, Grandmaster TR. He\nimmediately thanked him happily.\nTranmack walked past their thanks\ncoldly. Grandmaster TR's divine might is\nmatchless. Thank you, Grandmaster Tran,\nfor not killing. The villa lit up again.\nTranmack went to the second floor.\nLooking down, it seems he really moved\nin with great fanfare, wanting to\ndevelop the sect here. I also feel this\nis better. Tranmack inspected around\nfinding something. Cheered proudly. Now\nyou lamb sex life savings belong to me.\nTranmack held two pills in his hand\ncontinuing. Consider this the rent you\nguys are paying just enough for me to\nupgrade the formation. Then Tran Mack\ncalled out the red snake hack hack.\nAfter I leave this place is your home.\nYour mission is to protect this place.\nThe small snake curled into a heart\nshape towards him. Then happily wrapped\naround tramax ant. He reminded doingly\nhack hack. Be obedient. Use the\nspiritual energy here to cultivate your\nbody. In the future, I will give you\nanother round of nurturing. A few days\nlater, the atmosphere in the villa was\npeaceful. Tran Mack was sitting enjoying\ntea. Suddenly sensed, \"Sure enough,\nsomeone has come. But why is there only\none person?\" Kuang Ha's son walked in,\nsaying, \"The fog in front of my eyes has\ndispersed. Can I interpret this as your\ninvitation?\" He asked curiously. \"Not\nvery old, but unusually calm. Aren't you\ncurious who I am?\" Tramac answered\nwithout hesitation, \"You are someone\nsent by the government.\" Hearing this,\nKuang Ha's son stopped being polite,\nsaying directly, \"So, are you prepared\nto be bound and surrender or stubbornly\nresist to the end, implicating your\nfamily?\" Tranmac immediately acted,\nusing spiritual energy to threaten. If\nyou have the ability, come at me. If you\ndare touch my family, don't blame me for\nbeing ruthless. Kuan Ha's son glared\nback. Are you threatening me? You want\nto confront the government? Tramac\nremained confident. You can think so. I,\nTramac, do what I say. Hearing this, he\nlaughed with interest. Good lad.\nArrogant enough. It seems wiping out the\nwhole van family was indeed you. Next.\nHis words startled Tramac. Kid, I am\nKuan Haan. You may not have her my name,\nbut you must have heard of the war\ndragon special forces in Duong. Dentian.\nTranmac became alert, thinking, \"This is\nindeed a top figure with decision-making\npower.\" A moment later, the two sat down\nto drink tea. Kuan Ha son said, \"The\nspecial forces are a special branch\nunder our command. Kid, right now the\nsix super families led by your\ngrandfather proposed to use thunderous\nmeans to execute you on the spot at any\ncost.\" His face became serious,\ncontinuing. However, the great chief is\nvery wise, seeing through Lie Dong Duong\nusing public office for private revenge.\nSo, he temporarily suppressed this\nmatter, but it won't last long. Tramax\nseemed to realize that too, asking, \"But\nyou came here today not just to remind\nme of these things, right?\" Kuanghai's\nson bluntly offered two choices. You\nonly have two paths now. One is to\nbecome an official government employee,\nmake contributions to atone for crimes.\nTwo is to stubbornly resist to the end.\nConfronting the nation, Tranac was\nstartled, asking back, recruiting so\nblatantly, the six super families in\nHadu don't object. Hearing this, he\nsnorted coldly. Huha people are\nultimately Hasha people. Huasha does not\nbelong to the six great families. As\nlong as you agree to join the\ngovernment, subject to government\nregulation from now on, we will\nnaturally solve the trouble from the six\ngreat families for you. Tranmack refused\nwithout hesitation. Joining is fine, but\nI don't want to be controlled by you\nguys. He pointed at Tranmack, asking,\n\"You want to refuse?\" Transmac replied\ncalmly. At worst, I make the live family\nchange their head or let your government\nhigh level personnel change a bit.\nSeeing this attitude, Kuang Ha's son\nground his teeth in anger. Arrogant. Do\nyou want to rebel? Tramac asked back\nprovocatively, not denying. Why not?\nThen Kuang Ha son stood up, reluctantly\nagreeing. Fine. The great chief\nanticipated this early on and guessed\nyour request. But you still must have an\nofficial identity. The captain of the\ndivine eagle special forces, Hawkdong\nmen, has been missing for a while. you\ntemporarily replace him.\" Tramac closed\none eye, replying indifferently. \"In\nthat case, I'll reluctantly accept.\"\nKuang Ha's son threw a badge to Tramac,\nsaying, \"After handling your affairs,\nbring this divine eagle special forces\nbadge to find me.\" The eagle-shaped\nbadge was a bit dazzling. Tramac took\nout a golden one and said, \"I also have\na golden one.\" Kuanha's son took it and\nexamined it for a while, asking, \"Why do\nyou have this badge?\" Tranmac answered\nhonestly. In the great northwest desert,\na middle-aged man was chased by two\nwestern experts. He asked me to pass a\nmessage to Duong Denten. Then he died.\nHis face immediately became grave.\nAsking he died? So what message did he\nask you to pass? Tranmack pondered for a\nmoment then replied, \"You are Duong\nDinten's leader. Telling you is no\ndifferent.\" He said, \"The death\norganization has started assassinating\nHashia martial arts experts. Tell Duong\nDinten not to act rashly. Block the\nenemy outside the border. Kuang Ha's son\nlistened. Staring at the badge. Heaven's\nwill. It's all heaven's will. The person\nwho gave you the badge was Hawk Dong\nmen. Finished speaking. He immediately\nstood up reminding the news. Hawkdong\nmen exchanged his life for is extremely\nimportant. I must return to Hadu\nimmediately. You should come find me\nquickly. Tramac thought. Give me a few\ndays to prepare first. He thought of\nlied to Fuang and on tin. must give the\nrefined protective jade pendants to mom\nand sister. Tramac also prepared a sword\nfor Yin Quinton, giving the fang men\nsword refined specifically for her to\nlet the sword recognize its master. Then\nhe thought again, still have to\ncultivate the wood element body to great\ncompletion. Seems it won't be boring. A\nfew days later in Hadu, a car was\nspeeding along. The driver looked at\nTramac and said, \"Mr. Tramac, Elder\nKuang has arranged accommodation for\nyou. Tomorrow morning, Elder Kuang will\npersonally come and pick you up. Tramac\nwas silent, thinking, \"I just feel like\nI'm being dragged into something\ndangerous.\" A moment later, they\narrived. The driver invited Tramac out.\n\"Mr. Tram Macack, please get out. We\nhave arrived.\" Looking at the gloomy\natmosphere around, Tran Mack asked\nsuspiciously, \"Is this a hotel or a\nprison?\" The driver said, \"Nothing.\"\nOnly pointing the way, \"Sir, ahead is\nthe entrance.\" However, Tramac was not\nafraid at all, thinking, \"I actually\nwant to see what tricks they are\nplaying.\" Two people walked inside. The\ndriver stepped up to handle procedures.\nTrouble you to open the door. At the\nsame time, Tramac also noticed a strange\ndoor nearby. A moment later, the driver\nturned back, smiling sinisterly. Mr. TR,\nplease. Tramac paused, glanced once,\nthen still decided to go in, saying, \"If\nyou have any tricks, just bring them\nout.\" The door immediately closed. Kid,\npray for yourself. Tramax slowly walked\ninside. The room was fully furnished.\nThe space was also very spacious.\nSuddenly his whole body shook looking\naround. This place had more than 10\norus. Suddenly a group of people rushed\ndown surrounding him tightly. About 10\npeople were lying in ambush waiting for\nhim to enter. Haha. Long walk down\nsaying with interest. Is it Tramac?\nTramac pondered. Two grand masters plus\n10 internal realm great completion\nmartial artists. This strength is enough\nto sweep through some small sex in the\nmartial arts world. Then he frowned and\nreplied, \"It's me. So what?\" Tranmax\nsaid disdainfully, \"Don't know the\nimmensity of heaven and earth.\"\nImmediately after, the palm of Tranmack\nburst into flames, his face unchanging.\nHeavenly mystic divine fist third form,\nsuppressing universe. In an instant, he\nreleased the fire attacking towards\nthem. Haha, long and the others were\nforced back by the heatwave. He thought\nto himself, \"This move is actually so\npowerful, I can barely stand firm right\nnow.\" After the show of force to\nsuppress them, Tranmack began to\nquestion, \"Speak. What does Kuan Ha's\nson want to do?\" He said sternly, \"Does\nhe want to wait for me to kill these two\npeople before he shows his face?\" Kuang\nHa's son stepped out from nowhere,\nsaying, \"This is a test. All personnel\nwho want to join important government\nagencies must go through it once.\" He\naffirmed firmly. Tranmac asked\nsuspiciously. \"Testing here?\" Kuang Ha\nson continued, \"Originally, there was\nmore behind this, but currently we can't\neven proceed with the first step. You're\nthe first person to cause this\nsituation. Seeing this, Tranmack replied\nin boredom. Boring. Take me to the\nDivine Eagle Special Forces.\" Kuan Haan\nthen said, \"You have arrived.\" Tranm\nsuddenly understood, looking around and\nasking, \"You say this is the Divine\nEagle Special Forces?\" To prove it, Kuan\nHa son said, \"Haha, Long, assemble the\nteam. Welcome your new captain.\" Haha\nLong, who was lying on the ground\nstruggling to get up, replied, \"Yes.\" A\nmoment later, the team had assembled.\nKuanghai's son introduced. \"The Divine\nEagle Special Forces is an elite unit\nselected from the elite of the elite.\nNone of them will submit to you. This\ncaptain position won't be easy to\nhandle.\" The commander shouted,\n\"Attention, eyes right, front, eyes\nfront, report. The Divine Eagle Special\nForces has a strength of 36. All 36\npresent. Report complete.\" Tramac\nseriously introduced himself. I am\nTranmack. From today onwards, I will\nassume the position of your captain. The\ncommander immediately said, \"Report.\"\nTramac replied, \"Speak.\" The commander,\nlike the others, asked indignantly. \"Our\ncaptain is Hawkdong men. On what basis\ndo you get to be our captain?\" \"Our\ncaptain was a hero of indomitable\nspirit. Can you compare to him?\" \"Our\ncaptain led us to charge through rains\nof bullets and storms of bombs, killing\nenemies. You were just a student. Can\nyou compare to him? Tranmack just calmly\nreplied, \"I do not deny that Hawkdong\nman was indeed a hero, but I will not\nlose my life over a piece of news\nbecause I fundamentally will not reach\nthat stage.\" Tran Matt continued, \"I\nalso will not take you through rains of\nbullets and storms of bombs. Because if\nwe encounter a situation that even I\ncannot resolve, then you certainly\ncannot.\" Hearing this, the team members\nall shouted angrily, \"Brat, you are not\nallowed to slander Captain Hawk. You're\nnot qualified. If you have ability,\nprove yourself to us. Want to be our\ncaptain? Keep dreaming. Suddenly,\nTranmack asked, \"Do you have guns?\"\nHaving said that, Tranmack spread his\narms, signaling them, \"What do you want\nto do? Shoot me?\" Hearing these words,\nall team members were stunned. The\ncommander hesitated, \"What did you say?\nToo arrogant. Do you want to die?\" Li\nangrily spoke up first. \"Let me want to\nscare us. Don't blame me if you die.\"\nTramac then asked, \"What is your name?\"\nHe assumed a shooting stance and\nreplied, \"I am Lie Ho.\" He glared, veins\npopping, threatening. Dare to insult our\ncaptain. You must die. As soon as he\nfinished speaking, he pulled the\ntrigger, shooting straight at Tramac.\nHowever, Tramac did not dodge at all,\nonly using two fingers to catch the\nbullet. Liho and everyone else were\nastonished to the point of being dazed,\nunable to understand. How is this\npossible? He didn't dodge, nor did he\nuse internalqi to block. In everyone's\nastonishment, Tranmack calmly held up\nthe bullet and asked, \"Now, do you feel\nI can be your captain yet?\" In the\noffice, Tran Mack was reading the terms,\nthen said, \"Stop. I'm only responsible\nfor teaching you martial arts. I won't\nmanage other matters.\" Haha. Long raised\nhis eyebrows and replied, \"The Divine\nEagle Special Forces already has a\nmartial arts instructor.\" Tranmack\nasked, \"Who is it?\" He replied, \"Someone\nfrom the Bachma martial arts family.\" He\narranged the documents and continued,\n\"This is the tiger roar art that the\ndivine eagle special forces is\ncultivating. Because of my special\nstatus, I have a different cultivation\ntechnique.\" Hearing this, Tranmack asked\ncuriously, \"Is your cultivation base the\nhighest here?\" Haha. Long replied, \"Yes,\nthat's right. My cultivation is at the\npeak of internal realm. The majority of\nthe team members are still hovering in\nthe external realm.\" Hearing this,\nTramax signal for him to withdraw. All\nright, you may withdraw. I know now.\nHaha. Long accepted the order. Yes.\nAfterwards, Tranmack flipped through the\nreport and said, \"The foundation of\nthese people is too poor and their\nnumbers are large. The most suitable for\nthem is the mystic heaven ascending\ndragon way. This foundation\nestablishment technique is most suitable\nfor beginners.\" The next morning, the\nteam assembled. Tramax shouted, \"Vice\ncaptain ha, step out of the ranks.\"\nHaha. Long although not understanding\nstill stepped out and replied here.\nTranmack handed him a stack of papers\ninstructing carefully. This is the\ntechnique after I have modified it named\nascending dragon art used to replace the\ntiger roar art you are cultivating. 3\ndays later I will check the cultivation\nprogress and answer questions during the\ncultivation process. Haha long took the\nstack of papers thinking with some\nsuspicion. Any cultivation technique\ngoes through countless geniuses creating\nand improving it. He actually completed\nit in just one night. Haha. Long frowned\ntighter as he read, finally exclaiming\nin horror. Oh my god. The soldiers\nbehind whispered modified a technique in\none night. Just don't kill anyone.\nThat's too unreliable. However, Haha\nLong turned around with immense joy and\nannounced this set of techniques is\nextremely rare. 100 times stronger than\nthe technique we are cultivating.\nEveryone must strive to cultivate.\nCherish this opportunity. Everyone asked\nback in surprise. Really? Then that's\ngreat. We can become strong now.\nHahaong's attitude was completely\ndifferent. Enthusiastically asking Tram\nMac. Captain TR, can the chi cultivated\nfrom this ascending dragon art fuse with\nthe chi everyone is currently\ncultivating? Tranmax stroked his chin\nand replied, \"Ascending dragon art is\nmodified based on the foundation of\ntiger roar art. The chi cultivated can\ncompletely fuse with theqi of tiger roar\nart. Suddenly a person walked over\nloudly commenting nonsense. Fan twe\nwalked over contemptuously and said any\ntechnique if modified even a little the\nmeridian operation route and the\ncultivated chi will absolutely not fuse.\nYou don't even understand this yet you\ndare to modify techniques for them truly\ndeserve to be thrown out and beaten to\ndeath. All soldiers cheered happily.\nInstructor fan instac\ndirectly announced you are instructor\nfan twe in charge of martial arts\ntraining. You are fired. Fan twe\nretorted stubbornly. I'm not bound by\nthe rules here. No need to listen to\nanyone's orders, let alone someone like\nyou who doesn't even understand the most\nbasic common sense of the martial arts\nworld. Tranmack immediately commented,\n\"The martial arts common sense you speak\nof is nothing more than an excuse for\nthe martial arts world to cover up its\nown ignorance and incompetence. Seeing\nhimself looked down upon, veins popped\nout on him. You still dare to mock the\nentire martial arts world. Anger made\nhim lose control, he channeled magic\npower into his fist, threatening, \"Then\nI will teach you a lesson on behalf of\nthe martial arts world.\" He rushed up\naggressively. Diamond mountain breaking\nfist. All soldiers exclaimed in fear.\nThis is his strongest marshall skill. He\nused his ultimate move right from the\nstart. Will Tranmack be in danger? Do we\nneed to report to superiors? However,\nbefore he could even touch a finger\nTranmack, he was punched away by\nTranmack. Get lost. Fanu was immediately\nsent flying. He struggled to get up,\nasking in panic, \"You are Grandmaster?\nHow is this possible? Even if you\nwomb, it's impossible. Tranmack directly\ndespised him without mercy because you\nare an ignorant and incompetent piece of\ntrash. His self-esteem humiliated. Fan\ntweet said angrily. Brad, if you have\nthe guts, come to Bachmod district in 10\ndays to participate in the martial arts\ntournament. At that time, someone will\nnaturally deal with you. Hearing this,\nTranmack accepted with some interest. 10\ndays later, all right, I will arrive on\ntime. fan tweet turned and left\nresentfully. Good. Don't you regret it.\nEveryone witnessed this and had a new\nperspective on Tramac. Unconventional.\nTruly too doineering. He is too strong.\nPossessing such strength. His previous\nperformance was too modest. Following\nhim, we can also become powerhouses. 10\ndays later, Bachmod District, a girl was\nlive streaming. The Bachma District\nMartial Arts Tournament has a history of\n100 years held once every three years\nlasting three days hosted by the Bachm\nMartial Arts family. The fan family\npeople were buzzing with discussion.\nHeard the genius of the fan family is\nabout to come out of seclusion. There is\nalso a recently emerging master tran\nless than 20 years old. Don't know if he\nwill come. Noon spoke up with disdain. A\nmaster less than 20 years old sounds\nlike a scammer. Dares to show his face\nin Bachma. Muang a young girl in a\nyellow dress stood out and shouted, \"You\nall shut up. No turned his head with\ninterest and asked, \"Where did this girl\ncome from? Looks quite unfamiliar.\" The\ngirl in a yellow dress, shouted\nindignantly. \"Master Tran is my idol. I\nwon't allow you to badmouth him.\"\nEveryone laughed. Turns out to be a fan\ngirl. I'm also a master. Little sister.\nWorship me. Noctton deliberately teased.\nLittle sister can use any posture to\nworship. We will all cooperate. Then he\nthreatened in a low voice. Didn't even\ngo ask who I, no knock on am yet dare to\ntell me to shut up. He loudly ordered,\n\"Catch her. Let me teach her how to be a\nwoman.\" The girl in the yellow dress was\nstunned. \"What?\" Just as she screamed,\n\"You guys don't come over here.\" A\nfigure flashed in front of her. She\nopened her eyes in surprise. Tranmack\nwas standing in front protecting her.\nNoon asked angrily, \"Who are you? Dare\nto meddal in the Noi family's business?\"\nTranmack immediately retorted, \"Just\nnow, didn't you say I was a scammer?\" He\nimmediately flew into a rage. \"You are\nthat Master Tran?\" A girl in purple\nwalked closer, holding Trax's hand and\nsaid, \"Are you Master Tran?\" I am TE\nHo's granddaughter, T2 Y. Noctton loudly\ncursed at this moment. Scammer, you\nreally dare to come to Bakma to throw\naway your life? I will fulfill your\nwish. Noon was about to rush in to hit\nTranmack. Two wise shouted, \"Careful!\"\nTranmack waved his hand impatiently,\nnoisy. This wave of his hand directly\nslapped Noi knocked on in the face. He\nwas knocked onto his back on the ground,\nspitting fresh blood from his mouth.\nEveryone shouted worriedly, \"Young\nMaster Noi, young Master Noi, how are\nyou?\" However, he was quite resilient.\nHis mouth still didn't give up. You dare\nto hurt me? The Noi family won't let you\noff. This is Bachma, not Kening. This\ntime, Tran Mack truly lost his patience.\nHe raised his hand threateningly. Shut\nup. A wave of pressure crashed straight\nonto Noi Noctton, causing him even more\npain. He thought with difficulty.\nExternal release of trueqi\ntransformation realm Grandmaster. He\nreally is a grandmaster. Tranmack coldly\nwarned. Next time you make me take\naction, your head will fly. Understood?\nGet lost. Noon left resentfully,\nsecretly hating in his heart.\nGrandmaster TR, I will definitely take\nrevenge for this grudge. Afterwards,\nTranmack turned to T2Y and said, \"If you\njust came to watch the excitement, then\ngo back.\" She also honestly replied,\n\"Yes, being able to meet you once, I'm\nalready satisfied.\" In the secret room\nat Danhome Manor, many people gathered\nto discuss. Fan tweet asked loudly, \"You\nare all talents of the Bachom Martial\nArts World. What are your views on\nGrandmaster TR participating in the\nmartial arts conference?\" He angrily\nslammed the table that Grandmaster TR\nsurely came to snatch resources. I\nabsolutely will not allow it. Noon's\nfather, Noi Trouang Van, confidently\ndeclared, \"As long as my Noi family is\nhere, he shouldn't dream of achieving\nhis goal.\" Fanu immediately agreed.\nGood. This time, we will make sure that\nGrandmaster Tran has a one-way trip. The\nnext day on the martial arts stage,\nwhispering discussions arose. Heard that\nGrandmaster Tran arrived. Let's go see\nhow it is. Fanu sat on a referee's chair\nsaying welcome to the martial arts\nfamilies the seniors of famous sex who\nhave come to attend this Bach mom\nmartial arts conference. He thought to\nhimself many martial arts seniors who\nnever came before present today. I'm\nafraid they are all here to see\nGrandmaster Tran. Then he smuggly told\nhimself but Tranmack hasn't arrived yet.\nHe must be afraid. Suddenly Tranm walked\nin. Kinep Grandmaster Tran has arrived.\nTranmack calmly walked inside. Is it\nreally the 18-year-old teenage\ngrandmaster? Look quickly. Tramac looked\nup and asked, \"We're the people of the\nNoi family.\" No. Trangong Van stood up\nand replied, \"The Noi family is here.\nWhat do you want?\" Tramac went straight\nto the point and demanded immediately\nhand over T2Y. I can leave your Noi\nfamily a bloodline. Hearing this,\neveryone started discussing loudly\nagain. What does he mean? Is he\nthreatening to wipe out the Noi family?\nTramac is so doineering. It seems this\ntime he is not afraid of the Bachma\nmartial arts world losing unity. Noi\nTruang Van sneered contemptuously. Very\nwell, Grandmaster Tran. Arrogant enough.\nI actually want to see what ability you\nhave. Noa confidently said, \"Patriarch,\nlet me teach him how to be a human.\" No.\nTrouang Van agreed. Good. Go. Don't lose\nour prestige.\nAsk Grandmaster TR for advice. Tranmack\nwave his hand disdainfully to make a\nmove on me. You are not qualified yet.\nChanged to someone else. Noi Naka saw he\nwas looked down upon and shouted too\narrogant. Grandmaster TR whether\nqualified or not. Try and you will know.\nTranmack impatiently waved his hand\nonce. In an instant the opponent was\nsent flying by one move. He fell to the\nground even shaking the stance. The\naudience exclaimed, \"What happened? Why\ndid I knock suddenly fly out?\" Tranmax\nstill seriously proposed. I'll say it\nagain. Hand over T2Y. No. Trang Van\nstill replied toughly. Just defeating a\njunior of my Noi family. I will\npersonally take your moves. The words\nwere not yet finished. He jumped down\nrushing towards Tranmack to attack. He\nwas confident that having stepped into\nGrandmaster for decades, he was surely\nstronger than this brat. However, before\nhe could be smug, Tranmack took a step\nforward, punch him in the face. Sky\nprofound divine fist first form severing\nmountain he fell down in disbelief\nasking how is it possible Tramac walked\nover threatening where is tit 2 why he\ndidn't answer Tramax swung his hand\ntowards the stands in an instant the noi\nfamily members sitting behind fan twee\nall had their heads fall to the ground\nfan twe said loudly everyone this person\narrogantly humiliates us like this if we\ncan't teach him a lesson what face do we\nhave to stand here thus All the guests\nwere angered and attacked together.\nBrother Fan is right. Kill Grandmaster\nTran. Kill Grandmaster Tran. Kill\nGrandmaster Tran. They rushed down\ntogether to attack. Brat, you asked for\nthis. Fant saw this and thought smuggly.\nSix Grandmasters joining forces. Let's\nsee if you die this time. A moment\nlater, many people had tightly\nsurrounded Tramac. They rushed up\ntogether, attacking together. Tran Mack\njust emotionlessly unleashed a move. Sky\nprofound divine fist third form\nsuppressing heaven and earth. Just one\nmove and everyone was sent flying. The\nothers on the stand stared with mouse\nagape. Then they shouted in admiration.\nOne punch defeated six people. They also\nlooked at each other suspiciously. This\nis too incredible. Six great grand\nmasters were defeated by his one punch.\nFanu's face was pale at this moment\nthinking, I guess he was very strong,\nbut I didn't expect him to be this\nstrong. Six people couldn't suppress\nhim. But Tran Mack didn't let Fan Tweet\nthink much. In front of him, another\nperson's head was separated from their\nneck. Tran Mack said again, \"Hand over\nT2 Y.\" Suddenly, a voice rang out from\noutside the martial arts stage. Stop.\nThe number one person of the Bachmom\nmartial arts world. The head of the fan\nfamily, Fan Knack, son, slowly walked\nin. He proposed with satisfaction. Young\nman, I actually cannot see through your\nstrength. Your cultivation method must\nbe very good. Hand it to me. I will let\nyou leave. Tranmack opened his mouth and\nsaid, \"It's all the same. Your\ncultivation method is also very good,\njust a bit messy.\" Fanac son was stunned\nfor a moment, asking, \"You can see the\ncultivation method I practice.\" Tranmac\nimmediately replied, \"You want to strive\nfor a breakthrough, but your vision\nlimits your creativity, leading to the\nfact that although you cultivated\npowerful strength, it is very hard to\naccumulate.\" Hearing this, he also\ncuriously agreed. Correct. Can you help\nme solve it? Tranmack pointed out to Fan\nKnack's son, \"You still need a vessel\nworthy of this kind of power.\" Hearing\nthis, he pondered and asked, \"What is\nthe meaning of these words?\" Then he\nclapped his hands forcefully,\ncomprehending the implication in that\nsentence. He immediately sat down and\nbegan to cultivate. However, some\nignorant people ran out shouting,\n\"Protect the patriarch.\" Fan three\nsignaled his subordinates to protect\nFanak's son. Tranmack laughed secretly,\nthinking, \"Fan's son is indeed a\ngenius.\" Fusing the strengths of a 100\nschools of martial arts, finding the\ndoor of immortal cultivators,\ncultivating spiritual power, his talent\nand perseverance are extremely high.\nEveryone on the stands was curious. What\nis the situation? Patriarch Fan was\nenlightened by a few words from\nGrandmaster Tran. If so, his\ncomprehension is too enviable. A moment\nlater, Fan's son opened his eyes. He\nslowly stood up straight, then bowed to\nthank Tran Mack. Thank you, Master Tran,\nfor the pointer. This shook the whole\nstand. They exclaimed one after another.\nMaster Tran. He actually called him\nMaster Tran. Is this wanting to take\nGrandmaster Tran as a teacher? Becoming\nhis junior fan was also panicked saying,\n\"Patriarch? He is the one who\nsuccessfively slaughtered people of the\nBachmom martial arts world. I asked the\npatriarch to demand justice for the\nBachmom martial arts world.\" But Fanak's\nson asked bluntly, \"What does the Bachom\nmartial arts world have to do with me?\"\nAfter saying that, he turned to Tranmack\nand proposed, \"Master Tran, please let\nthis humble one entertain you. Let this\nhumble one fulfill the duty of a host.\"\nTranmax signaled refusal. \"No need. I\nstill have things to do.\" Then he glared\nand threatened, still not telling the\nwhereabouts of Titu, Y. A young master\nsaid in fear, \"I'll talk. I'll talk.\"\nMiss Tat was hidden by young master Ton\nin the Noi family separate villa.\nTranmack said angrily. Since you were so\nloyal to the Noi family, I will fulfill\nyour wish. As soon as the words fell,\nthe person standing behind that young\nmaster was immediately beheaded. He\nbegged in fear. Grandmaster TR, I will\ntake you to find the person. Don't kill\nus. But Tranmack didn't stop. The Noi\nfamily members were killed one after\nanother. I am not resigned. Fant saw\nthis. His soul scattered. The Noi family\npeople. When Tran Mack left, Fanak's son\nbowed respectfully. Farewell, Master\nTran. Fan tweet also bowed tremblingly.\nFarewell, Grandmaster Tran. Tranmack was\nled by that young master. As soon as\nTran left, everyone still thought in\nfear. Too strong. This is Grandmaster\nTR. A moment later, Tran Mack arrived at\nthe place. That young master said,\n\"Young Master Ton hid the person inside.\nI don't know the specific location.\nTranmack went in. Welcoming him was no\nTon. His face was bruised, but he said\nscornfully, \"Grandmaster TR, didn't\nexpect you to be able to find this\nplace.\" Really surprising. Tramac just\nordered coldly, \"Come out.\" Old man Noi\nwalked out from behind and said,\n\"Grandmaster Tran really has ability.\nThis old man is already close to the\ngrave. Didn't expect you to still be\nable to sense this old man's existence.\"\nNoon reminded him, \"Grandfather, be\ncareful.\" Then that old man not knowing\nlife from death continued. Grandmaster\nTR, do you know how many girls want to\nclimb into my grandson's bed? T2, why\nbeing chosen by my grandson is her\nblessing. Tranmack ignored his words,\ngoing straight to the point. I made a\ntrip to the martial arts conference.\nYour Noi family has been wiped out by\nme. Now it's your turn. If you hand over\nT2Y, I will leave your bodies intact.\nHearing this, old man Noi roared in\nanger. What did you say, brat? You\nactually killed my whole Noi family. I\nmust hack you into 10,000 pieces.\nTranmack replied without fear. Then\nwe'll have to see if you have that\nability. Old man Noi rushed forward\nfiercely. Tranmack die? The old man\nstruck a palm towards Tranmack. However,\nTranmack blocked it with just one hand.\nThis blow terrified the old man. This\nblow was even stronger than the power of\nthe six people just now. But then\nTranmack swung a fist with the other\nhand, saying scornfully, \"Just a useless\nmove.\" As soon as the words ended, he\npunched old man Noi. The old man was\nsent flying. No Nakan's face turned\npale, shouting loudly, \"Grandfather.\"\nHowever, the old man stood up as if\nnothing happened. \"I'm fine.\" His\nfingers became sharp. The old man said,\n\"Your living soul life force is\nparticularly strong. It's right for me\nto absorb.\" Tranmack immediately\nrealized, \"You are an evil spirit living\nby sucking other people's living soul\nlife force. I definitely must kill you.\"\nBut the old man didn't care, separating\ninto several shadows. Cut the crap.\nEight corpses chasing soul. Tranmax\nstill counterattacked confidently.\nNothing but illusions/heaven\nbreak. A glowing sword appeared. It\nrushed towards each shadow to attack.\nOne of old man Noi's arms was also\nchopped off. He asked in astonishment,\n\"What magic weapon is this?\" Tramac\nreplied calmly, \"You are not worthy to\nknow.\" This time, Old Man Noi used his\nhand to parry the sword. Get lost.\nHowever, his remaining arm was still\nchopped off. Noctton ran over anxiously.\nGrandfather, the sword that was parried,\nchanged direction and turned back. Old\nman Noi gritted his teeth. Noctton urged\nimpatiently, \"What are you two doing\nstanding there dazed? Come help\nquickly.\" But just as the sword was\nabout to stab, the old man pushed\nNoctton in front of him as a human\nshield. He was immediately split in two.\nSeeing this, the guards ran for their\nlives. Run quickly. This old man even\nused his own grandson as a human shield.\nBut the old man didn't let them escape,\nchasing after them. He pounced on the\nfirst one, bit his neck, and sucked his\nspiritual energy. Suddenly, the old\nman's arms grew back, he said\nrefreshingly, much more comfortable.\nThen he turned back to Tran Mack with\nhatred. \"I must deal with that, Brad, to\navenge my grandson.\" As soon as he\nfinished speaking, he opened the window\nand fled. Tranmack quickly chased after\nhim. \"You want to die?\" Then he\ncontrolled the flying sword to slash\nacross the old man's waist. However, the\nold man didn't die and continued\nrunning. This made Tranmax suspicious.\nWhat? Tranmack became serious. So, he\nhas demonized. Then I have no choice but\nto slay the demon. Tranmack controlled\nthe flames to fly towards old man Noi.\nThe fire quickly approached and grabbed\nthe old man. Immediately after, the fire\nengulfed and burned the sever body. In\nthe blink of an eye, the old man\ncompletely turned into ashes. At this\nmoment, the secret room door opened. Too\nwas tied there, tears streaming down her\nface. It's Tranac. Tranmack walked\ncloser to her. So, Master Tran, thank\nyou for coming to save me. Tranmack\npatted her head to comfort her. All\nright, it's all over. Suddenly,\nTranmax's phone rang. He answered and\nasked, \"Yer, do you need me for\nsomething?\" at the same time at Hong Nam\nvillage. The four quarters assembly is\nan annual event for the four regions of\nJang Bay, Bakma Ma, Hadong, and Hushi to\nresolve disputes and divide resources.\nHeld for many years, the assembly is\nquite famous. Every time it attracts a\nlarge number of powerful figures to\nwatch the fights, the martial art\ncompetition on the ring was still\nongoing. Tonbatien was successively\ndefeating trash opponents. The\ncommentator's voice rang out. The\nfighter invited by Hong Tran Long of\nHadong defeated a grandmaster under Shun\nKai Shung of Hushi with one punch. The\ncommentator exclaimed in surprise,\ndefeating a grandmaster with one punch.\nWho exactly is this? He introduced\nhimself smuggly. My name is Tonbatien.\nRemember this name that makes you ants\ntremble. In the stands. Hong Tran Long\nwas incredibly excited. Master Ton is\ntoo powerful. This time I can get most\nof the benefits from Jang Bay, Hooi and\nHadong. Shun Kaishong of Hooi was\nfurious wondering where Hong Tran Long\ninvited such an expert. Goofong of Jang\nBay also complained. Damn it, this time\nhe took quite a lot of advantages. Heavy\nlosses. Hong Tran Long turned to Mo Dunk\nand said, \"Emo Dungk, last time you won\ntwo matches causing me heavy losses.\nToday I want you to hand over half of\nBachma.\" Hearing this, Emo Dung\nsaid to Uncle Twi, \"This person could\ndefeat a grandmaster with one punch. His\nstrength is extraordinary.\" \"Uncle Twe,\ndon't go up. I'll forfeit directly.\"\nUncle Twi volunteered. Patriarch, I\nshould go up to stall for time. As long\nas Master Tren arrives in time, our Mod\nDong family can turn defeat into\nvictory. Hearing this, Mod Dung\nhurriedly stopped Uncle Twi. Do you want\nto sacrifice yourself? No way. But Uncle\nTwi had already stepped onto the ring. I\ncome to seek advice from your high\nmoves. Uncle Twi thought to himself,\n\"Yenner, I hope your position in Master\nTran's heart is heavy enough for Master\nTran to arrive quickly to save the\nsituation.\" Tonbatien said\ncontemptuously, just a lamp before the\nwind. Saying so, he rushed forward, but\na lion hunting a rabbit also uses full\nstrength, \"Take this punch.\" Uncle Twi\ntried his best to defend, but was still\nsent flying by Tonbatien with one punch.\nEven so, he struggled to stand up. You\nare very strong, but I can still fight.\nTonbatien rushed forward fiercely again,\nboasting without shame. Take another\npunch of mine. Uncle Twi looked around,\nthinking, Master Tran hasn't arrived\nyet. Never mind. I originally intended\nto use this old frame to repay the Emo\nDong family's life-saving grace back\nthen. Suddenly, Tanatien's fist was\nblocked. A voice rang out. Get the hell\nout of here. Tranmax slowly walked into\nthe venue. Everyone shouted, \"Master\nTran.\" Uncle Twi was overjoyed. Master\nTran, you finally came. Hong Tran Long\nwas surprised. Master Tran, isn't this\njust a high school student? Tonbaen\nlaughed with contempt. This brat still\nsmelling of milk. Is Master Tran? Stop\nbluffing. Obediently kneel down and\nadmit your guilt. I will show mercy and\nspare you from death. Tranmax still\nwalked up confidently. If you kneel down\nand beg for mercy now, I can spare your\nlife. Hong Tran Long shouted angrily,\narrogant, daring to act recklessly in\nfront of Mr. Ton. Are you tired of\nliving? Tranmack turned his head and\nshouted, \"Scram!\" Hong Tran Long was\nimmediately surrounded by illusions. He\npanicked and cried for help. \"Help! Help\nme!\" The spectator said, \"The killing\nintent is too strong, almost\nmaterializing. It seems he really has\nsome skills. Tanbatian still laughed\nconfidently even if you really master\nTran. So what? My greatness is not\nsomething you can imagine. He provoked.\nDon't expect me to go easy on you.\nFinished speaking. He jumped up with\ngreat momentum. Uncle Twi exclaimed in\nhorror. Eight armed three strengths.\nThis is the unique martial art of the\neight armed god ape Hang. So he is\nHang's disciple. 20 years ago, Hangung\nin Southeast Asia led the Azure Dragon\nHall. He founded a Hashia, successively\ndefeating eight Grand Masters. Rumor has\nit that the Hashak government had to use\nhigh-tech weapons to threaten him into\nleaving. Hearing this, Tranmack smiled.\nThis person could be considered a genius\nto be able to create this kind of\nmartial art on the Emperor Star.\nImmediately after, Tranmac also assumed\na stance sky profound divine fist. first\nform. His expression became serious. Sky\nprofound divine fist. Second form. Then\nhe unleashed power towards Tanbatian.\nTonbatin turned around his face full of\nsurprise and was immediately sent\nflying. He asked himself in disbelief,\n\"What power is this? I'm already at the\nhalfstep divine realm. Yet I couldn't\neven block one move.\" Sensing danger, he\nthought, \"Must escape from here at all\ncosts.\" As soon as he stood up, he\nimmediately turned to run. However,\nTramac sword had already flown out.\nTranmack looked at him contemptuously.\nWant to run now? Too late. In an\ninstant, the flying sword pierced\nthrough Tonbatien's body. He screamed in\nhorror. How can it be? Then he fell\ndown, going to the other world.\nTonbatien dead. Everyone was endlessly\nadmiring, shouting. Master Tran slew the\nmadman in three moves. Tranmax sneered,\nturning his head to look at Hong\nTranlong. Hong Tran long fell to the\nground in fear, cowtowing and begging.\nMaster Tran, spare my life. I am willing\nto offer Hudong to Master Tran. Tranmac\nglanced to the other side again. Shank\nKai also trembled and said, \"I, if\nMaster Tran wants, I am willing to offer\nHushi to you as well.\" Then, Tranmac\nturned to Emo Dong and said, \"Patriarch\nEmo Dong, the two regions of Hadong and\nHooi, I'll trouble you to manage them\nfor me.\" Emodong bowed and replied,\n\"Yes.\" At the Divine Eagle Special\nForces base, soldiers were training\nrunning. Sunha asked him, \"Do you know\nwho the person you killed in Hong Nam\nvillage was? He was Hang Tsung's\ndisciple.\" Tramac replied indifferently.\n\"So what?\" Sunha continued, \"Hang enter\n20 years ago, sweeping across the entire\nHasha martial arts world, forcing the\ncountry to use special means to drive\nhim away. Now he has a reason to enter\nHashia again.\" However, Tramac replied,\n\"If he dares to come, I'll just kill\nhim.\" This made Sonha angry enough to\nalmost slam the table, you brat. You are\ntoo arrogant. Do not underestimate the\nenemy. Tramac just replied, \"Okay, okay,\nokay.\" A moment later, when leaving,\nSunha reminded, \"Don't cause trouble\nduring this time.\" Tranmac thought,\n\"It's time to charge towards the sixth\nlevel of condensation chi.\" Half a month\nlater, Macnee University, Tranmack\nbreathed a sigh of relief. He walked in\nthinking separated by 600 years. I have\nfinally returned to this place. He\nsmiled firmly. This time I won't leave\nany regrets. Men's dormatory. Tramac\nknocked on the door. Before this, he\ntook the time to participate in the\nuniversity entrance exam. His score was\njust enough to enter this school.\nGoodbye, old friends. Tramac walked into\nthe dormatory. The people inside were\nstartled, paying attention to him. A\nmale student who looked like an ethnic\nminority stood up to greet. Hello, I am\nan ethnic minority from Kuduat thag\nnamed how I knew. Another male student\nalso stood up. My name is Haken. There\nwere two people who came early. They\njust went out. You will meet them when\nschool officially starts. All my life I\nhave been troubled by the pronunciation\nof my name. The remaining person also\nran over enthusiastically. Hello, I am\nWendingu from Hang Chum. Passionate\nabout ancient martial arts. Tramac also\nhappily replied, Hello everyone, my name\nis Tramac. Night fell Ja district villa\nby Sait Tang Yan Lake. Two strangers\nsneaked inside. Tombai turned and asked\nHong Lang, \"I remember you still have a\nmore powerful one. Why didn't you bring\nit?\" Hong Lang laughed and said, \"Don't\nmention it. This damn place has two\nstrict security checks. The one in my\nhand took so much effort to bring in.\"\nTombai looked towards a villa again,\nsaying, \"Hong Lang, are you sure this\nthing can successfully destroy the\ntarget?\" Hong Lang said confidently,\n\"Don't worry. My baby can level a small\nhill. And he fired the weapon. Go, baby.\nThe artillery shell slowly flew into the\nvilla courtyard. The villa was\nimmediately swallowed by flames. Hong\nLang triumphantly declared, \"Job done.\nWithdraw.\" However, they didn't realize\nYin Quinton was standing right behind\nthem. She questioned, \"Who are you\npeople? Was that artillery shell just\nnow fired by you, too?\" Hong Lang was\nhorrified. \"It's an angel. You're\ninside. If I knew earlier, I wouldn't\nhave blown it up.\nYinqinton was furious. Sure enough, it\nwas you go to die. Hong Lang screamed in\nfear, \"Help!\" Toni blocked in front of\nHong Lang, directly throwing a punch to\nmeet Yin Quinton's fist. However, her\npunching power was too great. The shock\nmade his arm numb. He stepped back\nwearily. Yin Quinton asked curiously,\n\"You're also a martial artist.\nNo, I am not a martial artist, but a\nmutant controlling the wind element.\nAccording to the way you Hasha people\nclassify strength, I am equivalent to\nthe Grandmaster level. Hearing this, Yin\nQuinn Ton laughed contemptuously.\nGrandmaster, you're not worthy. Feeling\nhumiliated, Tonai furiously. Girl,\nyou'll pay for your rudess. Then he\nexecutes a move. Wind, he my command. He\nimmediately controls wind blades to\nattack Yin Quinton. Hang\ndonut by curses. Damn it. Do you want to\ndie? If she doesn't die, we die.\nHowever, Yin Quinton is not afraid at\nall. Countering trash martial arts, open\nyour eyes and see what true hasha\nmartial arts is. She uses the sword\ngiven by Tran Mack. Power exploding like\na phoenix appearing. Seeing this, Tombai\nruns away even before Hong Lang run.\nHong Lang is stunned, screaming, \"Damn\nit, I'm an explosives expert. I can't\nrun fast. Wait for me.\" However,\nshe swings the long sword. Tomi cast a\nspell. Not good. Wind, protect me.\nHowever, Yin Quinton is a step faster,\nstriking right in front of him. Not far\naway, Hong Lang speaks up. Beauty,\nyou're too fierce. I have to punish you\na bit. Yin Quinton doesn't pay much\nattention, knocking away a bullet with\nher bare hand. Hong Langs face turns\npale, exclaiming, \"How is that possible?\nThis bullet is specially made. It can\npierce even steel.\" Yin Kuin Tan coldly\nswings her sword. Die. Hong Lang falls\nbefore finishing his sentence. Then she\nwalks closer to Tonbai, threatening,\n\"Speak. Who sent you?\" He replies, \"I\ndon't know anything. Don't dream of\ngetting anything from my mouth.\"\nReceiving no answer, Yin Quinton says,\n\"Is that so?\" In that case, I can only\nhand you over to the Hasha government. I\nguess they will have a hundred ways to\ndeal with you. He is immediately scared.\nHonestly confessing, we are from the\nSoutheast Asian assassin organization,\nLifechaser. Green Dragon Hall hired us.\nThe target is a person named Master\nTran. Yin Quinton raises her sword,\npraising, \"Very good. Thank you for your\ncooperation.\" Tombai stiffly says, \"I\ntold you everything. You must let me\ngo.\" But Yin Quinton kills him while\nsaying, \"Did I say I would let you go?\"\nAfter dealing with the two, she thinks\nto herself. Green Dragon Hall in\nSoutheast Asia. Tram Mac, who did you\noffend again? On the phone, Yin Quinton\nreports to Tranac. Last night, the\nSoutheast Asian green dragon hall sent\nthe Lifechaser assassin organization to\nraid the Yan Guue Lake Villa. It has\nbeen handled cleanly. Tranmac is\npuzzled. Lifechaser organization? Green\nDragon Hall. Suddenly, a voice comes\nfrom behind. Tranmac. A girl in\nsportsware walks over. Tranac, you\ndidn't expect I would come to this\nuniversity too, right? Tramac also\nhappily turns around. Indeed, I didn't\nexpect it. He thinks her grades could\nclearly get her into a better school.\nHow should I respond to her feelings?\nThe girl walks over and thanks Tranmack.\nThank you for coming to Hong Nam village\nto save my father last time. Tranmack\npolitely replies, \"You're welcome. After\nall, you asked me. Besides, I didn't go\nempty-handed.\" Suddenly, Tramac reaches\nout and hugs her waist. She is\nimmediately stunned, blushing. Next,\nTramac takes her away from the spot,\ndodging a black shadow. The ground\nbeneath slowly closes up. She asks in\nconfusion, \"What happened? We were\nalmost swallowed by the ground just now.\nTramax seriously orders, \"Come out.\"\nSuddenly, three figures appear. Their\nstyles are different. The girl asks in\nsurprise, \"Who are these people?\" Maka\nwalks closer and says, \"Little sister\nlooks really pretty. How about coming\nwith me?\" She refuses in disgust.\nDisgusting. Monta back speaks up. Mada\nstop talking nonsense. Kill him quickly.\nSuddenly, Tranmack asks, \"You did the\nearth control technique just now?\" Hack\nLao Qui calmly says, \"You understand\nmagic arts? Could it be you are also\nfrom the magic lineage?\" Tranmac\nimmediately says with disdain, \"Someone\nof your level deserves to be called\nmagic arts.\" Hackli immediately gets\nangry. \"You dare look down on my magic.\nI want your life.\" Saying so, he casts a\nspell to attack. Rock golems. Three\nmonsters rise from the ground. Macdom\nmocks Tranmack. Hack Laauoqui is angry.\nKid, you're going to suffer this time.\nHackla Qui orders, \"Crush him.\" The girl\nhides behind Tramac, warning, \"Trramac,\nbe careful.\" Tramac just smiles\ncontemptuously, just a pile of mud. He\nraises his hand, shouting, \"Forbidden!\"\nIn an instant, all three monsters are\ndestroyed cleanly.\n\"You dare to destroy my rock golems. I\nam irreconcilable with you.\" Maka says\nto Monta, \"Ma, seems like this kid isn't\neasy to deal with. Let's attack\ntogether.\" Monta also replies indeed\ncannot be underestimated. Next, Mac Ada\norders the snake on his body. Go suck\nhis blood dry, my little baby. He points\nat Tramac and says, \"Go.\" Monta also\nrushes forward. I will grant you the\nmost pleasant death. Tramac assumes a\nstance, still saying contemptuously, \"A\nbunch of ants.\" Tranmac, quick as\nlightning, appears in front of Mac, Ada,\nand Monta. He throws a punch, knocking\nboth of them to the ground.\nConveniently, he crushes that beastly\nsnake to death. Ma howls in pain. You\ndare to kill my pet snake? He threatens\nfuriously. I'mma skin you alive. Saying\nso, his body inflates like a ball, then\nrushes straight at Trac. Watch me crush\nyou in a meat paste. However, Tramac\nquickly throws a punch straight into Mac\nat his stomach. Mach does bounce back\nagain. He thinks he can actually reflect\nmy force from behind. Monta also seizes\nthe opportunity to attack. Got you\ncrescent moon slash tramac doesn't\nbother turning his head just glances\nback immediately kicking him away get\nlost mad feels there is a chance to win\nso he encourages man taught to continue\nrushing up we coordinate the attack\nMontar replies you attack the front both\nrush up together tranm just coldly\nfrowns and says sky profound divine fist\nthird form then another punch knocks\nboth of them flying suppress universe\nmonta screams in pain damn shadow\nShadow, stop being lazy. Tranmack\nimmediately becomes alert, realizing\nsomething is wrong. Fortunately, a\nbarrier appears, saving the girl. Shadow\nalso dissipates accordingly. Tramac asks\nher worriedly, \"How are you? Are you\nokay?\" She replies, \"I'm fine. It's just\nthat the jade charm he gave me broke.\"\nSo, Tramax shouts furiously, \"Get the\nhell out here. You despicable villain\nwho only dares to attack a female\nstudent.\" Behind him is suddenly silent.\nShadow unexpectedly appears and\nambushes. However, Tran Mack has\ndisappeared. Mac Ada admires Shadow's\nstealth technique. Truly magical, worthy\nof being the number one figure in the\norganization. Monta also praises a\ngrandmaster proficient in stealth. The\ndeterrent power is far beyond\nimagination. But Tramax says with\ndisdain, \"Cheap trick, break for me.\"\nThen he punches the shadow. The person\nimmediately spits blood, ordering, \"Damn\nit, retreat.\" But Tranmax stands tall\nand motionless, raising his hand. Wrong.\nIt's death. Suddenly, blood flows\nendlessly from Shadow's body. He screams\nin disbelief. Impossible. I am the\nnumber one assassin of a lifechaser\norganization, a legend. Before finishing\nhis words, he falls down, passing to the\nother world. The remaining three are\nterrified to the extreme. What magical\ntool is that? Could it be the legendary\nflying sword? A myth? Is he a descendant\nof the sword immortal? Tramac turns\naround and says, \"It's your turn.\" At\nthis moment, Machis says in fear, \"Too\npowerful. Let's run.\" Monta stops him,\n\"Are you faster than Shadow?\" He stops\nand asks, \"Then what should we do?\"\nMonta immediately decides, \"Fight him to\nthe death.\" The foolish Mac Ada listens\nto Monta. You're right. Since we can't\nescape, let's gamble once. Hack Laauoqui\nalso expresses agreement even though he\nhas no fighting strength left. Fight him\nto the death. Monta volunteers to lead.\nI'll go first. He crosses his swords.\nCross crescent moon slash macha is\nunwilling to show weakness. Whatever,\nI'll risk it too. The two rush up\ntogether again. Tramac just calmly\nreplies. The weak only know how make\nnoise. I will give you a pleasant death.\nA huge power explodes from his body,\nthen stabs straight towards the two\nrushing figures. The battle ends. He\nbreathes a sigh of relief in exhaustion.\nHe turns around and says, \"Let's go\nback.\" But the girl stops him and asks,\n\"But the bodies of these assassins.\"\nLooking at the three bodies, he calmly\nreplies, \"Someone will handle it. Don't\nworry.\" Late at night, the top floor of\nthe high-end commercial districtra\noriental bar. I follow master's request,\nestablishing the mo family chamber of\ncommerce here together with the business\nelites of the Lynn Schwev family,\nbuilding a commercial empire with the\nlife spirit vein as the core. Tongue 2\nlooks out the window. However, what\nmeaning do power and profit in the\nsecular world have? Pursuing the eternal\nlife of 10,000 ages is the true\nmagnanimity and dominance. He thinks in\ndisappointment, but except for master,\nno one understands his principle, only\nknowing how to focus on immediate\nbenefits, doing their best to suppress\nothers. He shifts his thoughts. For\nexample, that guy and his family. A\nperson from the Yin family enters\nsaying, \"Seeing you wearing a towist\nrobe, logically speaking, you should be\na hermit sage transcending external\nthings. Why must you fight for fame and\nprofit in the mortal world?\" Tongue 2\nasks, \"Then you with the strength of\npeak internal realm, why don't you let\ngo of the mortal world and focus on\nquiet cultivation to break through\nsoon?\" The person shuddters inwardly\nthinking, \"I can't see through his\ncultivation, but he saw through me with\njust a glance. difference in strength is\nnot small. Then he says, \"It seems I\ncan't kill you today, but the foundation\nof the Yin family is not something you\ncan imagine. I still advise you to leave\nXonghai. My Yin family guarantees your\nsafe withdrawal.\" Tongue Tu is\nindifferent and contemptuous. Do you\nfind the Yin family very formidable? In\nmy eyes, it's not worth mentioning. The\nYin family person immediately gets\nangry. Tongue Tu doesn't let him finish.\nWarning, go back and tell those people.\nIf they are not convinced, just come.\nWhether in the open or in the dark, I\naccept it all. My mo family chamber of\ncommerce intends to be the king of this\nJeanghai prefecture. He shouts\nfuriously. You want to oppose the entire\nJeanghai? Hope you don't regret it\nlater. But Tongu's heart remains calm.\nWhat ability do you have to oppose my\nmaster Tramac? At the same time, Monta\nis piloting a spaceship back. A soldier\nsteps out to salute. Lord. It turns out\nTranmack has disguised himself as Monta.\nHe thinks, \"Calling me Lord? Seems like\nthis Monta's status is quite high.\" He\nfeels reassured. Then this Lifechaser\norganization is just a game. I'll go in\nand play a bit. Tranmack, disguised as\nMonta, enters the underground base of\nthe Lifechaser organization. He looked\naround thinking to himself, \"The\npatterns on the pillars are the four\ngreat divine beasts of Hasha. Could this\nlifechaser organization have been\nfounded by Hasha martial artists?\nSuddenly, a voice startled him. Is the\nmission complete?\nDe Mont. He bowed and replied, \"It is\ndone, but the others are all dead.\" It\nthen asked, \"Then why were you able to\nreturn?\" Monta replied, \"Because I have\nsomething I want to give to you, sir.\"\nIt then said, \"Just place it on the\nstone wall.\" Suddenly, a figure\nappeared. He walked up to Tranmack,\nreaching out his hand. What is it? Hand\nit over. However, Tranmack was one step\nahead, shaking his head in refusal. I\nmust see the Lord with my own eyes\nbefore I can hand it over. The other\nperson found this strange and asked\nMonta, \"How is it that you don't even\nremember me?\" Tramac no longer hit it,\nreplying, \"If a peak internal realm\ncultivator is the leader of the\nLifechaser organization, then how could\nhe command Grandmaster level\nsubordinates?\" He questioned in shock,\n\"You're not Monta. Who are you?\"\nTranmack revealed his true form,\nreplying, \"You sent two waves of people\nto kill me. Don't you know who I am?\" As\nsoon as he finished speaking, he grabbed\nthe man by the collar. He threatened,\n\"Brat, this is not a place you should\nbe. The Lord will kill you.\" But\nTranmack replied without fear. \"If you\nwon't talk, I'll use the soularching\ntechnique to see for myself.\" Hearing\nthis, he was terrified and reluctantly\nagreed, \"Wait, I I'll take you there.\"\nThen he led the way for Tramac. This\nway, the two of them went inside. The\nscenery around them made Tran Mack\nexclaim in admiration, \"The scenery here\nis truly beautiful.\" Suddenly, his eyes\nwidened as he noticed a thin man sitting\nthere cultivating. The blue-haired man\nwalked over, whispering, \"My lord,\nShadow's mission failed, and now the\ntarget has come to our door.\" Hearing\nthis, the person opened his eyes and\nsaid, \"Young man, you're the first prey\nwho dared to come to my door.\" Tranmax\nsaid, \"You are about to die. How\ndisappointing. Tell me who hired you and\nI can give you a quick death. He coldly\nreplied, \"Protecting the employer's\nsecret is an assassin's duty.\" So,\nTramac roughly reached out, \"No matter.\nI'll see for myself.\" However, the\nperson immediately disappeared, then\nappeared behind Tramac. Tranmack glanced\nlightly and said, \"You are a grandmaster\nof the divine glimpse realm.\" He laughed\neerily. \"Brat, looks like you have some\nknowledge. No wonder you dare to come\nhere.\" So, Tranmack excitedly said, \"I\nam extremely eager to fight a master.\nToday, I'll use you to test my current\ncultivation.\" He made a challenging\ngesture. Come on. Tranmack engaged in\nbattle with the assassin boss. He struck\nfirst and the other immediately reacted.\nThe two traded blows, fists, and feet\nclashing. Suddenly, he suggested, \"Brat,\nyou are truly a rare genius. Why not\ntake me as your master and take over the\nLifechaser organization?\" \"What do you\nsay?\" He continued, \"This is a massive\norganization with an annual income of\nbillions. Countless people drool over\nit.\" Tranmack replied disdainfully. \"Oh,\nbe my master. You're not worthy.\" The\nother immediately flew into a rage. I\ngave you a way to live, but you won't\ntake it. You just love seeking death.\nThen he released a powerful spiritual\nenergy. Azure blood. Tranmack looked at\nthe spiritual energy surrounding him. He\nthreatened. Now that you are my enemy, I\ncan attack you at will. Tranmack curled\nhis lip, sneering. Do you think just\nbecause I can't see you, I can't do\nanything to you? As soon as he finished\nspeaking, he landed a precise kick on\nhim. The other man was knocked to the\nground, wondering, \"Brat, how did you\ndetect me?\" Tring\ninstead, \"Name the employer. I can give\nyou a quick death.\" The other stubbornly\nstood up. \"You just got lucky. I don't\nbelieve you can hit me again.\" Tranmack\nscolded. \"Idiot.\" His fist once again\nlaunched precisely towards him. He was\nshocked. How is this possible? So all\nthree stood motionless. The blue-haired\nassassin opened his mouth to ask, \"How\ndid you break the blood color domain?\"\nTranmack replied, \"A true domain can\nform a world of its own, and a master of\nthe domain is the god of that world.\nThis thing is nothing but a blinding\nmist, yet you dare call it domain.\" The\nassassin boss raged again, drawing a\ngiant sword. Dare to look down on me?\nYou will pay the price. Tranmack calmly\nsaid, \"No wonder you're dying so fast.\nTurns out your ultimate move consumes\nyour own life essence and essence\nsource.\" He raised an eyebrow, laughing\ncontemptuously. \"But even if you hide at\nthe bottom of the sea with incredibly\ndense water attribute origin power, it\nwouldn't make up for your consumption.\"\nHearing this, the other couldn't help\nbut think helplessly, \"Why does he know\neverything about me while I still know\nabsolutely nothing about him?\" Then he\ncontinued to rush towards Tranmac. Azura\nBloodblade. However, Tramac was one step\nahead, launching a counter punch. Sky\nprofound divine fist, first form,\nmountain sunderer. He was defeated,\nretreating on the ground, filled with\nhatred. He didn't finish speaking before\nturning around with all his might to\nflee. Retreat first. But Tranmack\nwouldn't let him off so easily. He\ndidn't chase immediately, only saying,\n\"You can't escape.\" A moment later, on\nthe ground, he begged, stopping Tran.\nWait, don't come here. He made an offer.\nBrat, I'll give you the Lifechaser\norganization and all the assets I've\naccumulated over the years. Can you\nspare my life? But before he could\nfinish, he was destroyed. Tran Mack\ncoldly replied, \"Killing you. I could\nstill get those things.\" Then he\nthought, \"But the divine glimpse realm\nis much stronger than the body\nprotection realm. I must also improve my\nstrength quickly.\" A few days later,\nMcNe University held a mid-autumn\nfestival party. Everyone was dancing in\nthe Emo Dong hall. Mo Dong Yin Ni was\nthinking anxiously. Tramac has been\nmissing for a few days. Will he come to\nsee me at the mid-aumn ball today?\nSuddenly, Leit New Hoa from the Leap\nfamily in Jong Hai walked over and\nteased Yini. You're about to turn into a\nstone awaiting her husband. Hearing\nthis, Yiani cried out in grievance. New\nHoa, you're teasing me again. New Hoa\nlaughed happily, replying, I'm telling\nthe truth. I should have taken a picture\nof you just now as proof. Suddenly, a\nyoung man slowly walked over and said,\n\"Hello.\" Then he shily invited New Hoa.\nMay I invite you for a dance? New Hoa\nblushed and agreed. Sure. Suddenly, a\nhand reached out and grabbed her hand.\nVan Tianne Lang squeezed between the two\nand said, \"You can only dance with me.\"\nThe crowd gathered in discuss\nanimatedly. It's the legitimate son of\nthe Van family in Jeanghai, Vanten Lang.\nThe Van family is the largest martial\narts family in Jeanghai. Known alongside\nthe powerful elite family in the secular\nworld as the twin heroes of Jeanghai,\nthe young man persisted. Classmate, I\ninvited her first. Ten Lang didn't care.\nThreatening, if you don't want to die,\nget lost. New Hoa angrily tried to break\nfree from Vantan Lang's grip. Let go of\nmy hand. Yi also spoke up. Vantien Lang,\nlet go of New Hoa. You're crossing a\nline. He angrily said, I advise you not\nto meddle. Even Imo Dong wouldn't\ndare boss me around. However, you\nneedn't let go of New Hoa. She assured\nNew Hoa. Don't worry, I'm with you. I\nwon't go anywhere. Tien Lang was\nfurious. Looks like you want to do this\nthe hard way. Yiani retorted. What? You\nwant to hit a woman? Suddenly, someone\nwalked over. It was Co Lambfong of the\nCo family from Nam Hoa. He complained.\nTreating two female classmates like that\nisn't a bit too much. Vanen Lang turned\naround looking at Co. Lambfong with\ndisdain. Your father's like a dog coming\nto my house for three consecutive years\nbegging me to accept gifts and I didn't\neven bother. What kind of thing are you?\nLambfong immediately flew into a rage.\nWhat did you say? Then he couldn't hold\nback and rushed towards Tien Lang. Dare\nto insult my father. I'll fight you to\nthe death. However, he was immediately\npunched away by Tien Lang. Don't know\nyour own strength. Collam Fong hit the\nwall in pain. Tien Lang walked over and\nwarned, \"Don't come bothering me. You\nexternal realm trash.\" Suddenly, Tranmax\nspoke loudly from behind. Who is trash?\nHe continued disdainfully. Don't bother\nmy roommate. Internal realm trash. Van\nTianne Lang stubbornly said, \"There are\nthousands of martial artists in the\nworld, but those who can enter the\ninternal realm can be counted on one's\nfingers. Who are you to dare speak like\nthat?\" Tramac ignored him, slowly\nwalking past him. \"It's just the\ninternal realm. What's so hard about it?\nIt's nothing more than a snap of the\nfingers.\" Tranmack walked to Colam\nFong's side, handed him a pill, and told\nhim to take it and regulate his\nbreathing. Colam Fong asked in a days,\n\"You say you're my roommate? You are\nTranmack? I only have external realm\nstrength and average aptitude. I know\nmyself well. Tranmax still urged him to\ntake the medicine. Eat it. Circulate\nyour energy to regulate your breathing.\nColam Fong gave a sound of affirmation,\nthen immediately refined it right there\nin the hall. Vanlang raised an eyebrow,\nprovoking, \"I want to see what tricks\nyou guys are going to pull next.\" Tramac\ndidn't care, reaching out and tapping\nColamfong. Suddenly, Kolamfong's power\nseemed to skyrocket. Van Tienne Lang was\nshocked. He broke through to the\ninternal realm. How is that possible?\nTranmack interrupted. No, no, no. Open\nyour dog eyes and look carefully. Colam\nFawn's breakthrough is more than just\nthat. One step internal realm great\nsuccess. Van Ten Lang questioned loudly.\nWhat on earth did you feed him? Could be\na legendary supreme spirit medicine. You\nare truly wasting heavenly treasures.\nWhat a waste. Tranmack just shrugged and\nreplied, \"A thousand gold is hard to buy\nmy happiness.\" Hearing this, Vanten Lang\nturned purple with rage. \"Collam Fong,\nwho is cultivating, couldn't help but\nexclaim in amazement, this magical\nfeeling. I then,\" he knelt down\nreverently, thanking Tran Mack for the\nelevation in this life. I'm afraid it\nwill be hard for me to repay you.\nTranmack immediately said, \"Don't say\nsuch nonsense. Stand up. Make the one\nwho insulted you pay the price.\" Kolam\nFong immediately obeyed, walking towards\nVanten Lang. Vantenne Lang huffed\ncoldly, continuing to despise. So what\nif you raise your realm? You're just a\ntrash who takes drugs.\nAt this point, Van Ten Lang was still\nstubborn. I want to see what you've\nactually raised. Before he could finish,\nhe was punched hard in the face by Kolam\nFong. Colam Fong felt it wasn't enough.\nSaying, \"Not done yet.\" He rushed\ntowards Van Tianne Lang again. This\ntime, Van Tan Lang dodged, thinking to\nhimself, \"His true energy seems\ninexhaustible. I'm afraid that pill was\nextremely powerful. It's not good for me\nto drag this out and consume energy with\nhim.\" So, Van Lang immediately executed\na move. He could only use this move to\nwin quickly. Tranmax saw this and fell\ninto deep thought. This technique\nimplicitly aligns with the trajectory of\nthe Great Dao. It seems the Van family\nindeed has some substance. Van Ten Lang\ncounteratt attacked unleashing the sky\nsplitting slash. However, Kolam Fong was\nstronger. He rushed forward and\nunleashed a mountain splitting move,\nknocking Van Lang away, falling to the\nground, unable to get up. Tramax stepped\nforward and said, \"Vantien Lang, you\nlost.\" He remained stubborn. Even if you\ncan defeat me, can you go against our\nentire Van family of Xanghai in front of\nmy family's grandmaster? You're just\nants. Tranmack continued unwaveringly.\nRest assured, your van family in my eyes\nis nothing but a bunch of trash. Get\nlost. Van Ten Lang hatefully noted this\ndebt, insulting my van family. You will\npay a miserable price. Then he turned to\nLeit New Hoa and said, \"The debt between\nus, I will settle with Lee Kin Thuang\nslowly.\" She angrily evaluated\nshameless. A moment later, outside the\nmain hall, Tran Mack called out, \"Yi, he\nasked her, \"Don't you have anything to\nask me?\" Yini immediately replied, \"What\ndo you want to say? You will naturally\nsay on your own initiative. What you\ndon't want to say, it's useless for me\nto ask, right?\" Receiving this answer,\nhe thought with heartache, \"Yi, you\nshouldn't be so humble. I lived a new\nlife. Ultimately, is it to protect you\nor to harm you?\" \"At another place,\" a\nperson standing next to Van Ten Lang\nasked, \"Tien Lang, is it this place?\"\n\"That was the Grandmaster of the Van\nfamily,\" Van Loy. Van Tian Lang replied\nthrough gritted teeth. \"That's right.\nTranmack isn't in the dormatory. He\nlives right in this courtyard. Suddenly,\nTramax spoke up. It seems two rats have\nsneaked in. He had detected them, looked\nup at the two of them, and said, \"Oh,\ncoming to visit only now. Don't you\nthink it's too late?\" Vanl immediately\nreplied, \"Your cultivation is indeed\nprofound.\" Tien Lang losing to you is\nnot unjust. But since I have come here,\nI must demand justice for Tien Lang.\nNow, if you kneel down and admit your\nmistake to TN lang, I can spare you out\nof consideration for your youth.\nTranmack didn't forget to mock. It's\nlate at night. Are you starting to talk\nin your sleep, too? Vanly immediately\nflew into a rage. Brat, I'm a\ngrandmaster of the Van family. You can't\nafford to provoke me. Tranmack\nimmediately pointed his thumb down at\nthe ground towards him. Grandmaster\ntrash. Seeing himself humiliated, Vanly\ninstantly lost control, rushed down, and\ncursed angrily, presumptuous. Let this\nold man see what ability you actually\nhave to dare be so arrogant. Tranmack\nalso quickly raised his fist. Use your\nlife to see then. Then he punched Van\nLoy. Vanly vomited blood and pain. His\nwhole body was knocked flying, causing a\nslight tremor. Fonten Lang screamed in\nshock. Impossible. Vanl also slowly sat\nup, extremely bewildered. No,\nimpossible. You are so young, yet you\nhave already entered the transformation\nrealm. He immediately became like a dog,\ncrawling on the ground, begging for\nmercy. It was my van family that had\neyes, but failed to see Mount Tai,\noffending you. I still asked for your\nleniency. We will leave right away. It\nseemed Tranmack didn't want to let them\noff this time, either. He opened his\nmouth and said, \"Come as you please.\nLeave as you please.\" Van Lloyd was\nstunned. What do you mean? Tranmack\ndeclared loudly. I want to break Van\nLang's legs as punishment. Hearing this,\nVanen Lang's face turned pale. You dare.\nMy van family won't let you off. Van\nLloy also opened his mouth to refuse.\nYour strength is indeed extraordinary,\nbut this request is inevitably too\nexcessive. Seeing this, Tramac remained\nfirm and asked back. Excessive? Just now\nyou made me kneel. Called me\npresumptuous. Why didn't you say that\nwas excessive? finished speaking.\nTranmack directly cast a spell, breaking\nVan Ten Langs legs and also warned,\n\"Remember today's lesson. Your Van\nfamily is just so van Lang screamed in\npain. My legs.\" He fell to the ground\nrolling and wailing. \"It hurts. It hurts\nto death.\" Vanly anxiously ran to Van\nTian Lang's side. Tien Lang, I'll help\nyou stop the bleeding first. Van Tan\nLang moaned in pain yet didn't forget to\nthreaten Tranmack. I I will kill you. I\nwill definitely kill you. Van Loy also\nseemed extremely furious, noting this\nfeud. Sir, this feud, my van family will\nsettle it sooner or later. Let's go.\nWatching the two of them leave, Tranmack\nthought to himself, the van family,\nthere is no need for it to exist\nanymore. Jeanghai Prefecture, Tran\nTongu, was convening a shareholder\nmeeting. Mac family merchant\nassociation. gentleman. Ever since my\nMac family merchant association entered\nJonghai, he said seriously, \"We have\nalways been obstructed by big figures in\nthe Jeanghai business world. Now is the\ntime for our allout counterattack.\"\nEveryone responded in unison. The Mac\nFamily Merchant Association has prepared\nenough force. We are ready, just waiting\nfor your instructions. The Mac Family\nMerchant Association launched a\ncommercial war, quickly swallowing the\nelite families market. Small families\nthat originally relied on the Le family\ncollapsed one after another. The Le\nfamily was in imminent danger. In a van\nfamily living room, two people were\ntalking. The van family head van son\nopened his mouth to ask, \"Brother Lee,\nyou want my van family to take action to\nhelp you eliminate the highlevel members\nof the Mac Family Merchant Association.\nIt's not impossible.\" The Le family head\nLee Kinfuang replied, \"Brother Van, just\nsay it.\" Van's son then made a proposal.\nLet New Hoa marry Tien Lang. Wait until\nwe become in-laws. The Van family can\nlegitimately take action to assist.\nHearing this, Lee Kin Thuang asked\nsuspiciously. I heard Tien Langs legs\nwere broken. He's become a Why\ndo you still insist on me marrying off\nmy daughter? Hearing this, Van's son\nturned purple with rage. If it weren't\nfor your daughter opposing Tien Lang at\nsome ball, leading a young grandmaster\nto stand up for her, would Tian Langs\nlegs have been broken? Lee Kqin Fuang\nhurriedly said, \"I will definitely\ncompensate brother Van for this matter.\"\nBut Vansson seemed unwilling to\ncompromise. What will you compensate\nwith? Unless new Hoa marries Tien Lang.\nOtherwise, there's nothing to discuss.\nThe Le family can just wait to get out\nof the business world. Leqin Thuang\nreluctantly agreed. All right, I agree.\nA few days later, a grand wedding was\nheld. Le knew Hoa wore a crown on her\nhead holding her father's arm entering\nthe ceremonial hall alongside Vanten\nLang who was sitting in a wheelchair. He\nleaned in and whispered, \"Daughter, the\nLe family really has no other way. We\nhave to sacrifice you. However, you are\njust marrying over there. You can come\nhome anytime in the future.\" Le knew Hoa\nreplied sensibly, \"It's okay. I actually\nfeel that in breaking two legs is a good\nthing at this moment.\" The efficient\nspoke up. Groom, starting from this\nmoment, whether poor or rich, healthy or\nsick, will you forever never leave nor\nforsake and stay by the bride's side? Do\nyou agree? Vantenne Lang said happily. I\nagree. Your turn, bride. Mua, starting\nfrom this moment, whether poor or rich,\nhealthy or sick, will you forever never\nleave nor forsake and stay by the\ngroom's side? Do you agree?\nStopping them loudly. You cannot agree.\nVan's son blocked in front of Tran\ntongue too and said, \"Da is priest\ntranu.\" He questioned, \"My van family's\nwedding is not for outsiders to\nintervene. Do you think just because you\nare from the Mac family merchant\nassociation, no one can handle you?\" Lee\nKqin fuang also intervened indignantly.\nDais Priest Tran, are you trying to ruin\nour marriage alliance so that the van\nfamily has no way to help my lead family\nresist you? Tran tongue too still\nresponded firmly. Say what you like.\nthis girl from the Lee family. None of\nyou can touch her. Lee knew Hoa didn't\nunderstand what was happening, wondering\nin her heart, who is this old gentleman?\nWhy'd he come to save me? Leqin fuang\ncontinued to question, \"You are meddling\ntoo much. Weddings and funerals are\nprivate matters of my leap family. Don't\nbe too bullying.\" Tran Tongu looked at\nLee Kinfuang with contempt to receive\nthe Van family's help. You don't\nhesitate to sell out your own daughter.\nA father like you is truly too good.\nEveryone disgusted spiritedly at this\ntime. The Mac family merchant\nassociation. Is he the big shot standing\nbehind the lead family? Why did old\nmaster van come out? What are you guys\nmaking a ruckus here for? Van son\nimmediately ran over asking anxiously.\nOld master, why have you been disturbed?\nEveryone started discussing again. That\nold gentleman is Van Kong. 10 years ago,\nhe singlehandedly founded the Van\nfamily, turning the Van family into the\nnumber one aristocratic family in\nShanghai. Van Kong, he is actually still\nalive. Tran Tong too thought to himself,\n\"The Van family indeed still has a trump\ncard actually hiding such an old\nmonster.\" Immediately after, Van Kong\nstepped forward and asked, \"Seeing you\nwearing a Dowist robe, not cultivating\nan awist temple, what are you making\ntrouble here for?\" Tran Tong too\nreplied, \"Eliminating evil and\ndestroying vice.\" Hearing these words,\nVan Kong's face became unsightly. He\nasked, \"Are you saying my van family is\ndoing illegal things? Make your move.\nI'll see what ability you have to dare\ninsult my van family. Finish speaking.\"\nTran tongue too rushed up without\nhesitation, throwing a punch. Van Kong\nstroked his beard, saying with interest,\n\"Not bad. The fist wind is like a knife.\nIt has some mastery.\" Then he raised his\ncane. This old man will teach you a\nlesson today. Tran tongue too was\nstartled by the light. off. An explosion\nrang out at the wedding scene, also\nspreading to the people around. They\nwere all knocked back. I was blown away.\nThe wedding scene was a mess. The dust\nand smoke gradually dispersed. Tran\ntongue too retreated four or five steps.\nWhile Vancreated one step, he said to\nthink you can still stand firm. Then he\ncontinued to evaluate. You are indeed\nnot bad having some mastery to enter the\ndivine glimpse realm. In the same rank,\nyou can be said to be invincible. Tran\ntongue too said calmly. In my eyes, it\ndoesn't just stop at the same ring. Van\nKong said disdainfully. You want a\nchallenge above your level? Fine. I will\nfulfill your wish. Finished speaking. He\nraised his cane to continue attacking.\nPhantom dragon transformation. Then Van\nKong disappeared. Everyone was\nterrified. Where is he? Why can't we see\nhim anymore? Oh my god. Is that old man\na monster? Run quickly. Tran tongue too\ncalmly sensed. No, he didn't disappear\nbut was wrapped by a layer of clouds and\nmist. And this layer of clouds and mist\nis formed by the condensation of his\npowerful true energy. Then he discovered\na dragon appeared on the ceiling.\nEveryone fled in all directions. A\ndragon. Why did a dragon appear here? Oh\nmy god. Is that old man a monster? Run\nquickly. Van Kong incarnated as a dragon\nlooked at Tran Tongue 2 and said, \"Old\nDaoist, this is a little insight of mine\nfrom 15 years of seclusion. Today, I'll\nuse you to test the move.\" Tran tongue 2\nwas provoked, declaring heroically,\n\"Come.\" Today, this old man will tread\nthe heavens and slay the dragon. The\ndragon transformed from Van Kong\nimmediately rushed towards Tran Tong 2.\nTran tongue 2 also showed no weakness\nrising up to counterattack sky profound\nthree fists second form Tran tongue 2\nshouted loudly mountain splitting Van\nKong was knocked back a few steps he\nimmediately said have some ability but\nlet's see how long you can still hold on\nwithout waiting for him to think much\ntran tongue 2 continued to make a move\nsky profound three fists second form the\ngiant dragon also immediately opened its\nred mouth like a basin of blood and\nrushed over. Tran tongue too seized the\nopportunity to attack, severing water.\nThis strike had immense force, beating\nVan Kong back in a human form. He panted\nexhaustedly. Such a powerful move. Tran\nTong 2 also fell to the ground.\nSuddenly, Van Kong proposed, \"One last\nmove with all our strength. Let's decide\nthe winner.\" Tranungu agreed. I was\nthinking the same. This time, it was Van\nKong's turn to strike first. Dragon's\nsevering hand. He spread his hand out.\nSeeing this, Tran tongue too shouted\nloudly. Sky profound three fists third\nform wind shock. Van's son praised. The\nold master is using the dragon severing\nhand. Old Daist Tran will definitely\nlose. However, this old Daoist Tran\nstrength is truly astonishing. Large and\nsmall explosions rang out continuously.\nVantan Lang confidently declared, \"How\ncan a rogue cultivator with no\nbackground or power like you compare to\nthe foundation of my van family?\" He\nborrowed the power of the van family to\nknock Tran Tongue 2 flying. Tran tongue\n2 fell down while exclaiming,\n\"Impressive,\" Van Kong said, \"Your\npotential is stronger. In a few years, I\nwill no longer be your match.\" Van Sun\nspoke up. Dao is Tran regardless of the\nfuture. Currently, your strength is not\nequal to the old master. Why don't you\nadmit defeat to our van family? But\ntongue 2 refused to admit defeat,\nglancing sideways at Van Kong. So what?\nVan son sneered. You ask when you\nalready know. You are the loser. You\nmust pay the price. Take your Mac family\nmerchant association and get out of\nShanghai. Otherwise, we will spare no\ncost to destroy you. Tongue 2 laughed\nloudly. Overestimating yourselves. You\nare truly overestimating yourselves.\nYour van family has a trump card. Do you\nthink I don't? Van's son angrily\nthreatened. Dao is Tran. Stop boasting.\nYou basically can't. Before he could\nfinish, tongue too bowed. Disciple.\nTran. Tongue Tu respectfully invites\nmaster to take action and assist. Oh my\ngod, did I hear that right? He still has\na master. Amidst the crowd's discussion,\nTranmax slowly walked in. This old\nDowist is already so strong. Wouldn't\nhis master be even more perverted? To be\nhonest, this situation really can only\nbe suppressed by me.\nTranmac became the center of attention\nof the whole arena. Is he the master of\nthat old daist? How is that possible?\nHe's too young, a fake. I think he's\ntired of living. New Hoa loudly reminded\nTramac. Stop making trouble. Vanly\nfrowned. He might actually be old Daois\ntransmaster. An elder of the Van family\nimmediately ran over to refute Vanly.\nAre you blind? I think this brat is old\nDaist transg grandson Vanly replied if I\ncouldn't even withstand one punch from\nhim would you still think so the elder\nwas immediately horrified what the\nperson who defeated you with one punch\nis him long sle at this moment tran\ntongue too was bowing to tranmac\ndisciple is incompetent disgracing the\nsect please punish me master trmac\ncheerfully said I don't blame you the\ncultivation method Van Kong practices is\nnot simple and he has cultivated for a\nlonger time than you. If the cultivation\ntime were equal, you would kill him as\neasily as crushing an ant. Bansson\ninsolent. My van family has no grudge\nagainst you. Yet you cruy crippled my\nson's legs, turning him into a\nand now you insult my van family elder.\nAfter speaking, he immediately moved to\nattack Tramac. Kid, go to hell. Cloud\nflipping hand. Tien Lang was stunned. My\nfather used a family heirloom technique\nright from the start. Tranmack, you are\ndead for sure.\nJohnm, be careful. Tranmack disdainfully\nsaid, \"You are far from enough.\" As soon\nas he finished speaking, Tranmack threw\nVan's son flying. Get lost. Call Van\nKong out here. Van's son coughed up\nblood and pain. Tien Lang exclaimed in\ndisbelief, \"Impossible. My father is a\nbody protection realm Grandmaster. How\ncould he not withstand even one move\nfrom you?\" Kinfuang also stared with his\nmouth wide open, defeating Van family\nhead Van's son with one move. And he's\nalso the master of the leader of the Mac\nfamily merchant association. If new Hoa\ncould marry him, how high would the lead\nfamily's future status be? Just then,\nVan's son fainted. Someone supported\nVan's son and shouted, \"Family head.\"\nVan Kong stepped out again. As long as\nthis old man is alive, the Van family\nwill not collapse. He walked down to the\narena to confront Tramac. The Van family\nold master Van Kong did not forget to\nturn back and instruct the others. I am\nold. The future of the Van family is\nentrusted to you. Everyone panicked. Old\nmaster. Van Kong looked at Tranmack who\nwas bursting with momentum and said,\nTranmac, be careful. Van Kong stared at\nTranmack and sighed. This old man has\nbeen famous for decades and has never\nmet a match. You are the first opponent\nwho makes me feel I cannot win. I hope\nin this battle you can draw a perfect\nperiod for my life. Hearing this,\nTranmack agreed to his request as you\nwish. Suddenly, a stream of electricity\nshot out from the broken cane, then shot\nout sparks surrounding Van Kong.\nEveryone in the stands shouted, \"The old\nmaster's strength has clearly reached\nthe realm of rejuvenation. I feel the\naura erupting from the old master's body\nis even stronger than when he fought\nthat old Daoist earlier. Old master will\ndefinitely win. Tranmack was momentarily\npuzzled and asked, \"Oh, why must you\nsuffer like this?\" Tranmack frowned and\nreminded, \"You are burning your life\nforce. After this battle, regardless of\nvictory or defeat, you will certainly\ndie.\" The old master did not care about\nthe consequences. He calmly admitted,\n\"Correct. Therefore, if you respect me,\nunleash your full power.\" Tramac\nreplied, \"It will be as you wish.\" His\neyes glowed, fangs and claws grew, and\nhe shouted, \"Kid, watch closely. This is\nmy phantom dragon transformation at its\npeak.\" After speaking, he transformed\ninto a dragon. Seeing this, everyone\nexclaimed, \"Oh my god, this dragon looks\ntoo real. What principle is this after\nall? Too unscientific?\" Van's son said\nsmuggly. The old master's phantom dragon\ntransformation has reached such a realm.\nThis battle is a guaranteed win. The\nmajestic giant dragon rushed towards\nTranmack, letting out a loud roar.\nTranmack did not panic at all. He slowly\ncirculated his spiritual energy and\nshouted. Sky profound divine fist first\nform. Then he punched out powerfully.\nThe giant dragon was stunned upon impact\nand was knocked flying. The old master\ncoughed dryly, seemingly in great pain.\nHe wiped away the blood, stubbornly\nsaying, \"Exhilerating again.\" After\nspeaking, he turned into a giant dragon\nagain, rushing towards Tranmack once\nmore, the roars shaking the heavens and\nearth. Tran looked calm, chanting a\nmantra, sky profound divine fist, second\nform. Tranmac thought to himself,\nunleashing full power is the respect I\nhave for you. Then he shouted loudly,\nriver splitting, a stream of lightning\nsurged out, striking directly at the old\nmaster. He was immediately tossed up,\nspewing fresh blood and fell to the\nground. Tran tongue too on the side\nsilently analyzed the battle. Severing\nmountain range has unparalleled power\nlike a warrior cutting through all\nobstacles in front while river splitting\nis like an assassin seeing through all\nillusions. Striking straight at the\nvital point. Seeing this scene, everyone\nwas terrified and shouted worriedly,\n\"Old master, old master.\" The old master\nclutched his chest and laughed.\nExhilarating. Seeing this, Tranmack said\nwith interest, \"If it were anyone else,\nthey would have died long ago. You are\nworthy of being the pillar of the Van\nfamily.\" Then Tranmack clased his hands\ntogether. Performing the move, Sky\nprofound divine fist, third form. The\nold master stood up and praised. This\nmomentum truly young and talented. If I\ncan die under this earthshattering\nmartial art, my life will not have been\nin vain, he shouted loudly. This is my\nsupreme technique. Two ferocious giant\ndragons rushed out from his hands,\npouncing straight to Tranmac, dragon\nsevering hand. Tranmac remained\ncomposed, continuing to execute,\nsuppressing heaven and earth. He\nreleased a stream of lightning, burning\nthe old master until almost nothing\nremained. Only scattered ash and white\nsmoke remains swirling around. Everyone\nexclaimed in unison, \"Old master, where\ndid the old master go? Only Tranmack is\nleft alive. The old master has turned\ninto ash. He lost. Everyone was\nterrified. One punch to defeat Van's\nson. Three punches to kill Van Kong.\"\nLee Kin Thuang looked at the scene\nfeeling a bit of regret in his heart. If\nmy elite family could have this person,\nwe could enter the ranks of super\naristocratic families. But I marry my\ndaughter to that of the Van\nfamily. As for Leu Hoa, she thought\nhappily. It turns out he didn't need me\nto worry at all. Tramac pointed at Vanen\nLang, preparing to settle the score.\nVanen Lang, \"It's your turn.\" Seeing his\nson's head pierced by an invisible\nstream of energy. Van's son howled,\n\"Langer purple with rage,\" he roared at\nTranmack. \"You went against the old\nmaster. I have nothing to say, but why\ndid you have to kill my son? You want to\nbe a hero? Then don't blame me for being\nvicious. After speaking, Vansson rushed\ntowards Leit New Hoa. Lose the bride and\nlet's see how you play the hero. Like\nnew. Van crazily lunged at Leit New Hoa,\npreparing to throw a punch. I can't beat\nyou, Tramac. But crushing a normal\nperson to death is as easy as turning\nover my hand. She screamed in fear.\nClosing her eyes tight. Don't. Realizing\nshe was unharmed, she slowly opened her\neyes, wondering in confusion. I'm not\ndead. Van's son stood motionless on the\nspot, spitting out a mouthful of fresh\nblood. How can this be? Then his knees\nwent soft and he fell paralyzed to the\nground. Trax's lightning took the shape\nof a sword, pointing straight at\nVansson. Everyone exclaimed in unison,\n\"Family head.\" Tran waved his hand,\nlaughing coldly. See the reality\nclearly. I only need to wave my hand to\nwipe out your entire Van family. The Van\nfamily members all trembled, clamoring\nfor mercy. Don't kill us. We are willing\nto submit. Tranmack warned. Those who do\nnot submit die. From now on, the Van\nfamily will merge into the Mac family\nmerchant association. Then Tran Mack\nturned to New Hoa and instructed,\nremember, never compromise yourself for\nanyone's sake. She replied happily,\n\"Thank you. However, why are you so good\nto me?\" Tramac replied seriously because\nI owe you. Leu Hoo was a bit surprised.\nOh, me? No way. We've only met for the\nsecond time. Hearing this, Tran chuckled\nlightly. Some things it's enough that I\nknow. He thought to himself, \"The ill-\nfated relationship of the past life. I\ndon't want you to become the second Emo\nDong Yin Ni.\" Then Tranmack turned to\nTran Tongue 2 and said, \"Next, hand over\nthe Mac family merchant association to a\ntrustworthy person to manage, and you\nreturned to Ja.\" Tran tongue 2\nrespectfully clased his hands and bowed\nas you command, master. People around\nbuzzed with discussion. The Van family\nwedding has turned into a funeral. How\ncan we hug this big thigh? The Van\nfamily is a martial arts family. Being\nwiped out belongs to the grudges of the\nJangghu. He won't have to bear any\nresponsibility. The scene shifts to\nbeneath a deep blue sky. Someone is\nrelaxing on the beach, pointing at a\nbright spot in the sky, saying, \"Hey,\nlook. What is that?\" The people around\nexclaim in surprise, \"Oh my god, what is\nthat? Quick, take a picture and post it\non moments.\" Eight armed divine monkey.\nHang with a serious expression flies\nthrough the air with his hands clasped\nbehind his back. He flies towards a\nvilla area. Swallow return lake villa.\nHang looks down from above, assessing.\nHasha actually has a place with such\nabundant spiritual energy. The spiritual\nenergy within a 100 miles seems to be\ndrawn here. He takes a deep breath. This\nspiritual energy is truly too\nrefreshing. Tang Tang jumps down from\nthe second floor balcony demanding, \"Who\nis it?\" His face darkens, frowning as he\nsays, \"You don't look very old, yet you\nare already at the peak of the internal\nrealm.\" It seems that Master Chin really\nhas some tricks. Saying that, he rushes\nforward, shouting, \"Master Chun killed\nmy two disciples, so I'll kill one of\nhis first.\" Tang Tang is startled.\n\"What?\" Before she can react, she takes\na hit to the stomach and is sent flying\nbackward. Tang Tang hits the wall and\nfalls to the ground. She struggles to\nstand up and spits out a mouthful of\nfresh blood. Seeing this, Hang Tsung\nsays, \"Not dead yet. Then take another\npunch.\" He prepares to strike again with\na vicious look. Just then, a voice calls\nout, \"Stop.\" Yen Quinton runs over\nholding a sword. Who exactly are you?\nHang is startled. Grandmaster realm?\nThen he laughs despicably. Are you also\na disciple of Master Chin? It seems\nMaster Chin really likes having women\nserve him. Quinton prepares to attack,\nshouting shameless, \"You want to die?\"\nYin Quinton rushes forward in anger, but\nHang blocks her sword with just two\nfingers. He says smugly, \"The sword\nisn't bad, but the strength is lacking.\"\nRealizing the situation is bad, she\nimmediately retreats. Thinking he is\nvery strong, she chants a spell. Phoenix\ndancing in the nine heavens. A red\nphoenix appears in midair. Seeing this,\nhe mocks. This move isn't bad, but still\nuseless. Then he shouts loudly, \"Vra\nfist.\" The two collide violently,\ncausing a loud explosion. Quinton is\nblasted away, spitting fresh blood, and\nfalls heavily to the ground. As for\nHangung, he lands lightly. He sneers.\nSwordsmanship and sword combined\nperfectly. Merely a trueqi realm\ngrandmaster, yet able to tear through my\nprotective aura. Hang takes out his\nphone and start a live stream declaring\nwar. Master Chinasha, I will wait for\nyou for 3 days. If you don't come, I\nwill take this villa and the lives of\nthese two female disciples. Sia capital,\nthe center of supreme power in Hashia.\nHot sand slams the table ordering. Eight\narmed divine monkey hangs the line.\nContact Tranmack immediately. 3 days\nlater. Everyone is buzzing with\ndiscussion. It's been 3 days. Master\nChun should be coming today, right? I\ndon't think he'll come. He's definitely\nscared. Are a house and women as\nimportant as one's life? Someone says,\n\"I don't believe it. Master Chin's image\nwon't collapse.\" In the crowd, Tran Mack\nwith a dark face walks forward slowly.\nHe walks up to Yin, Quinton, and Tang\nTang announcing, \"I'm here.\" Seeing\nTranm, Quinton is overjoyed. \"I knew it.\nYou wouldn't tolerate this kind of\nprovocation.\" Tang Tang also adds, \"You\nwouldn't abandon us.\" Tranm slowly walks\nto Quinton's side, asking gently with a\nsmile, \"Are you okay?\" Then Tranm turns\nto Hang, his expression changing 180\u00b0,\nquestioning, \"You are Hang Tsung?\" Hang\nis slightly surprised. You are Master\nChin, so young. How did you cultivate\nsuch a level of cultivation? Tramac\nanswers coldly. You don't need to know\nbecause you're about to die now. Hangs\nface turns black as the bottom of a pot,\nlaughing coldly. Is that so? At this\nmoment, Tramac jumps onto the balcony,\nmoving extremely fast, his figure almost\ninvisible. In an instant, he closes in\non Hangung and throws a punch. Hang\nTsung also blocks Tranmax attack. Hang\nsays, \"Interesting. Actually able to\nconfront me headon. Their movements are\nincredibly fast. The naked eye can only\nsee flashing spots of light. Those\nwatching this scene are stunned. Oh my\ngod, it started. When did Tran Mack\narrive? Look quickly. Everyone started.\nWhoever hasn't followed, press follow\nquickly. What kind of strength do these\ntwo actually have? Being able to fly in\nthe sky. They must definitely be in the\ndivine glimpse realm. Hang loses\npatience. Shouting enough probing. I'm\ngoing to use my full power. He begins to\nexecute a move. Eight armed vajra. A\nBuddhist statue appears behind him.\nTramac is not panicked at all.\nMaintaining a calm attitude, he shouts.\nSky profound divine fist first form.\nHang also counters. Vudra demon subduing\nfist. Tranmack just swings his hand and\nknocks eight armed divine monkey hang\nflying. Someone exclaims in amazement.\nOh my god, this one punch knocked that\nmonster into the lake. Unexpectedly, the\neight-armed Vudgerra, who swept through\nthe Hasha martial arts world 30 years\nago, is defeated today by an 18-year-old\nyoung man. Fiong stands to the side,\nleisurely stroking his beard. Tramac\ndefinitely has secrets on him. If we\nobtain them, perhaps we can break\nthrough to the divine realm. The\nscar-faced man beside him nods. I agree,\nbut relying on just the two of us won't\nwork. We must find two more helpers. He\nsmiles slightly. Don't worry. Under the\ntemptation of the divine realm, finding\nhelpers is very easy. Seeing Hangung\nstruggle to fly up from the lake,\nTranmox, is soaking in water\ncomfortable? He replies angrily, \"If I\nhad met you 30 years ago, I'm afraid I\nwould have only had a dead end. But\nafter 30 years of ups and downs, you can\nonly be a defeated opponent under my\nhands.\" Saying that, he spreads his arms\nwide, his eyes shining like headlights.\nChanting Vra descent, Hang Tsung says,\n\"This move cost me 20 years of effort.\nYou are the first to have the honor of\nseeing it.\" Tranm smiles confidently. I\nwill also be the last because this will\nbe the last time you have the chance to\nuse it. Hang curls his lips, mocking.\nQuite a boaster. Tran is extremely calm,\nslowly closing his eyes like playing\nthis game. Before the words are\nfinished, he suddenly swings his hand.\nHang is terrified. What? You can\nactually find my position? Hang thinks\nto himself. It must be a coincidence.\nHowever, Tran Mack delivers a kick,\nstriking hard into his stomach, mocking,\nplayed enough. Hang is kicked far away,\nsaying in disbelief, you can really find\nmy position. Hang remains stubborn. Then\nI will attack headon\nfeet and rushes towards Tranmac without\nestimating his own strength. Tranmac\nalso assumes a stance sky profound\ndivine fist third form. He executes the\nmove, suppressing the universe, and Hang\nTsung is immediately blasted away. The\ncollision creates an earthshattering\nexplosion. He staggers Ugg. Tran Mack\nhands his pockets, sneers. Is this all\nthe skill you have? Up with S. Hang sees\nTran Max standing on the roof, unharmed,\nthinking that the punch just now was his\nstrongest attack, it seems. Hang\nclutches his chest, humbly begging for\npeace. Kid, you are indeed very strong.\nYou kill my two disciples. I injured\nyour two disciples. Why don't we just\nstop here? Hearing that, Tramac decides\nnot to let him go. Just stop here. Are\nyou not awake yet? Hang thick-skinned\nputs on a persuading posture. Although\nyou are strong, killing me won't be that\neasy. It's better to know when to stop.\nTranmack immediately summons his weapon,\nreplying, \"I am someone who doesn't know\nwhat's good for him. What do you want?\"\nTramac shouts, \"Go.\" Hang sees a sword\nflying towards him. Shocked. What is\nthis? Too fast. In a moment of\nhelplessness, Hang Tsung can only risk\nhis life to run away. Can't avoid it\nall. Just have to risk it. Hang waves\nhis hand and shouts, \"Get lost.\" Not\nseeing the sword. Hang Tsung rejoices in\nhis heart. Luckily, the power of this\nflying sword isn't great. I can block\nit. But just as he lets his guard down,\nthe flying sword closes in from behind.\nHang turns his head to look. Truly\nunable to believe his eyes. How is it\npossible? Wasn't it knocked away by me?\nIt can still chase. The sword light\nflashes and Hang Tsung's head is sliced\noff neatly. Just one strike sends him to\nthe western heaven. Someone exclaims,\n\"Hang is dead.\" What exactly was that\nfinal golden light that killed Hang\nTsung? Filong sees this scene, cold\nsweat pouring down, saying, \"Luckily,\nHang Tsung forced him to use his trump\ncard.\" The scar-faced man beside him is\nalso stunned. He even has a weapon like\nthe lifebound flying sword of the Sword\nimmortal in Legends. It seems two\nhelpers aren't enough. The second night\nafter the great battle, Yin Quinton and\nTang Tang are meditating to recover.\nSuddenly, a voice speaks up, \"Master\nChun, disturbing you late at night.\nTranmack is slightly surprised, asking\nwho?\" Filong clasps his hands and bows,\nintroducing himself, I am true man\nFilong from Mount Jawa, wanting to\ndiscuss something with Master Chun. Tram\nMacmox discuss sneaking around and you\nwant to discuss. Come out all of you.\nFilong laughs loudly upon hearing this.\nI said it. We can't hide from Master\nChun. Then Filong waves his hand,\nordering, \"Come out, everyone.\" At this\nmoment, a group of people appears behind\nhim. Tranmack asks with interest. 12\nDivine Glimpse Realm Grand Masters\ngathered. \"Do you consider this place of\nmine a demolition site?\" Folong replies,\n\"Master Chun, you wouldn't let old men\nlike us leave empty-handed, would you?\nhand over the cultivation method you\nhave and we will leave immediately.\nTranmack gently scratches his face. Do\nyou think having many people can force\nme to compromise? Fong clenches his fist\nconfidently declaring war. We saw your\nstrength last night. With so many of us,\nwe can definitely defeat you. Tran Mack\nweighs his hand. Suddenly, a bolt of\nlightning strikes down, terrifying\nPhylong. If it were elsewhere, killing\n12 divine glimpse realm grand masters at\nonce might take some effort, but you\nforgot this is swallow return lake.\nSaying that, he executes a move, setting\nup the five elements grand array. As\nsoon as he finishes speaking, Tranmack\nteleports everyone into a formation in\nmidair. Filong screams in panic. What is\nhappening? They shout in anger. He set\nup a formation. We are trapped. This kid\nis too cunning. Seeing the chaotic\nsituation, Filong frowns and shouts,\n\"What are you afraid of? With the\ncombined power of the 12 of us, what\nformation can stop us?\" The remaining 11\npeople seem to be energized, answering\nin unison, \"Right, let's attack together\nand break this formation. However,\nfinally, someone cried out helplessly.\"\n\"Damn it, it seems we can't get out.\"\nTramac observed the situation, sneering,\n\"A bunch of idiots. 3,000 weak waters,\nwaves reaching the sky. The Grand\nMasters suddenly sensed danger. This\nwater is very strange. This water has\nbone corroding power. It can penetrate\nmy protective aura. Don't touch the\nwater or your body will become very\nheavy like carrying a huge rock. They\nwere immediately teleported to another\nspace. Beneath their feet was lava and\nraging fire could be seen through the\ncracks. Some Madhy true fire burning all\nthings. What kind of ghostly formation\nis this? This fire can also penetrate\nthe protective aura. Everyone, don't\npanic. Let's find a formation eye\ntogether, then break the formation.\nFilong spoke up to reassure them.\nEveryone, calm down. This formation is\nso powerful. The spiritual energy\nconsumption must be huge. He won't be\nable to hold on for long. We just need\nto stall until he dies. Suddenly, the\nscene changed and they were brought\nbefore Tranmack. He calmly asked,\n\"Gentlemen, how was the experience of\nthe extreme lands hearing this?\" Fi long\nlaughed loudly. \"Your formation's\nspiritual energy is exhausted, isn't\nit?\" Tranmack curled his lips, pointing\nto the sky. He said, \"Who said it's\nexhausted? A bunch of greedy fools.\nSomeone is already hungry and\nimpatient.\" They repeated in confusion.\n\"There seems to be something there.\"\n\"Hungry? Who's hungry? What does he mean\nby that?\" Suddenly, a red dragon\nappeared. They stammered in terror. That\nthat is a dragon emerging from the\nclouds. The dragon slowly flew to\nTranmax side. He reached out and stroked\nit. Good boy. Then he ordered, \"Go eat\nthem. Make up for your year of bitter\ncultivation.\" Fong finally realized, so\nhe released us just to feed his pet.\nSeeing the fire dragon playing in\nTramax's hand, they were terrified to\nthe extreme. He actually keeps a dragon\nas a pet. They immediately scrambled to\nflee. Scared out of their wits. Run\nquickly. What are you waiting for?\nTranmax sneered and waved his hand.\nIdiots, do you think you can escape? The\nfire dragon instantly grew larger,\nroared angrily, and rushed to attack.\nWhat? After eating its fill, it let out\na long, satisfied burp, hugging its\nround belly. Tramac nodded in\nassessment. With your intelligence, you\nwill definitely be able to transform\ninto a true dragon in the future. For\nnow, just serve as the mountain guardian\nspirit beast. He smiled and looked up at\nthe sky. 12 Divine Glimpse Realm Grand\nMasters suddenly disappearing this time.\nThe martial arts world forces will\nlikely have to reshuffle. However, I\ndon't care about these things. In the\nblink of an eye, it was late autumn.\nTranmack returned to the Le family to\nvisit New Hoa. Are the people in the\nfamily still making things difficult for\nyou? She looked radiant and at ease,\nreplying, don't talk about my family. No\none in this entire Jeanghai dares to\nmake things difficult for me. Tramac\nfelt relieved. So, you are free now?\nNuh-ho has scratched her head shy,\nsmiling. That's right, free. But the\nburden that has been on me since\nchildhood suddenly disappeared. I'm\nstill a bit unaccustomed to it. Do you\nthink I have a tendency to enjoy being\nabused? Tran Mack was stunned, falling\ninto deep thought. I always thought the\nthings I gave others were the best. Were\nthey really what they want? Suddenly,\nNew Ho's puzzled voice pulled Tran Mack\nback to reality. There seems to be\nsomeone waving at us ahead. Tranmax\nstepped forward in confusion and asked,\n\"Little six, why are you here?\" Li\nsaluted seriously in military style,\nreporting to instructor Tran, \"Something\nseems to have happened to the divine\neagle special forces. We hope you can\nreturn immediately to take a look.\"\nSensing something was wrong, Tran Mack\nhurriedly returned. Upon arrival, the\nsoldiers were lined up neatly, saluting,\n\"Greetings, Instructor Tran.\" Longo ran\nout, panting. Captain, you're finally\nback. He frowned in tension. What\nexactly happened? Longu reported\nbreathlessly. The cultivation of the\nteam members has run into problems.\nForced to suspend training, Tranmack was\nstunned, thinking that his cultivation\nmethod couldn't possibly have problems.\nHe ordered, \"What problem occurred? Tell\nme in detail.\" Long goose summarized,\n\"You mean all team members became\nextremely aggressive after entering the\ninternal state, often fighting over\nsmall matters to the point of bloodshed,\neven killing each other?\" Longa nodded.\n\"That's right,\" Tranm pondered. Their\ncultivation has all reached my\nexpectations, proving they haven't been\nlazy. However, their special forces\nsoldiers who have experienced hundreds\nof battles. They already carry killing\nintent. Coupled with their cultivation\nincreasing too fast and their foundation\nbeing unstable. They couldn't control\nthe power well, so they became\naggressive. Tramax smiled. I know the\ncause. Stop cultivating for the time\nbeing. I will resolve it for you. Long\nwas overjoyed, grinning from ear to ear.\nYes, thank you, Captain TR. Tramac\nthought as he walked with so many people\nof Foundation establishment, I need to\nfind some pills. That place definitely\nhas them. The scene shifted to Cuck\nDuong Prefecture, Lamb Twe Commander,\nDanfong Mountain, Medicine, King Valley.\nTranmax stood at the entrance, a bit\nworried. Nam Kung Lamb Tien of the Mock\nfamily whom I killed earlier was the\nbiological grandson of the current Mach\nfamily, head of the medicine refining\nfamily, Medicine King Valley, Mock\nTrihawk. Now that I'm here to ask for\nmedicine, I'm afraid it won't be that\neasy. Before the gate of the Mock\nfamily, there was a boy who had been\nkneeling for a long time, muttering, \"I\nbeg you to grant medicine. Save my\nfather.\" Seeing the boy's uncontrollably\ntrembling body, Tran Mack worried, \"This\nchild seems to have been kneeling for a\nlong time. His physical strength is\nreaching its limit. If I don't save him,\nI'm afraid he won't survive.\" Tramac was\ndecisive, deciding to use water element\nenergy to dispel the fatigue in the\nboy's body. A stream of cool spiritual\nenergy flowed into the body, weaving\nthrough every blood vessel, dispelling\nthe exhaustion. The boy, Lap Duk,\nimmediately felt refreshed and\noverjoyed. Am I? Lapduk looked at\nTranmack, tears of excitement falling.\nBrother, is this magic? The boy knelt\ndown and pleaded. I beg you to save my\nfather. Tranmack shook his head. I don't\nknow how to cure illnesses. I'm also\nhere to ask for medicine. Tramac asked,\n\"However, why are you kneeling here?\"\nAfter hesitating for a moment, Lap Duk\ncried and recounted sadly to treat my\nfather's illness. My family has nothing\nleft. I'm too young. No one will hire me\nfor work. I could only come to Medicine\nKing Valley to try my luck. Medicine\nKing Valley said, \"No money, no entry.\"\nI had to kneel here, hoping my sincerity\nwould move them. Tranmax sighed in\nunderstanding. Silly child. There's\nnever been a shortage of dead people in\nfront of Medicine King Valley's gate.\nHave they ever shown mercy? How about\nthis? I'll help you. The boy was\nstunned. Brother, aren't you also here\nto ask for medicine? Can you still help\nme? Moreover, my family really has no\nmoney left. He smiled firmly. Don't\nworry, I keep my word. He stepped\nforward to help the boy up. Let's go\nsettle your father down first. We'll\ncome back later. Lapduk said happily,\nyes. Later, at a hotel, Tranmack\ngenerously brought Lapduk and his father\nthere. rest here tonight. The manager\nstanding at the door shouted\ncontemptuously as soon as he saw them.\nWhat are you doing? You two beggars,\ndon't even think about stepping into our\nhotel. Tran Mack frowned, released his\npressure, and said coldly. I said we\nwere staying here. Do you dare to talk\nnonsense again? The manager's face\nturned pale, terrified. Such strong\nmomentum. At least a divine glimpse\nrealm. He hurriedly said respectfully,\n\"Yes, yes, please come this way.\" Tramac\nobserved secretly. Seeing lap Duke\nhappily taking care of his father\nmeticulously. He couldn't help but sigh.\nThis child is not affected by external\nthings. Doesn't fuss over gains and\nlosses. He is a good seedling. Before\nthe gate of medicine king valley tran\nmac after disguising himself slightly\nconfidently led chew lap duk to appear.\nThe boy said anxiously let's go brother.\nThe steward and guards at the door\nroughly blocked them. Stop. Medicine\nKing Valley is not a place you can enter\njust because you want to. Tranmack\nfrowned in confusion. Then what do we\nhave to do to get in? Lap Duk explained\nawkwardly and hurriedly. You have to\ngive some benefits, which means money.\nTrax suddenly realized. So it just needs\nmoney. After all, in his eyes, benefits\nhad long ceased to be related to money.\nHe immediately took out a thick stack of\nmoney and stuffed it into the hands of\nthose people. Is this enough? The\nsteward's eyes lit up extremely excited\nand said enthusiastically, \"So much\ngood, good. Please come in. You too.\"\nInside the valley, it was quiet. Lapduk\njawed behind, saying gratefully, \"I was\nblocked outside just because I didn't\nhave money. Luckily, I met Brother Tran.\nThank you so much.\" He nodded, saying\nsoftly, \"It's a small matter, but they\ndo this. Doesn't Medicine King Valley\nmanage it?\" The boy explains, \"Sadly,\nMedicine King Valley also doesn't want\noutsiders to enter casually. Doing this\ncan eliminate most poor people. Medicine\nKing Valley sees the benefits, so they\ntacitly agree.\" The peak of Medicine\nKing Valley. As soon as they arrived,\nthey saw a crowd surrounding the gate,\nshouting loudly, \"We already paid. Let\nus in.\" Several guard announced with\ntroubled faces, \"Micine King Valley is\nshort on medicinal ingredients recently\nand is not selling pills to the outside.\nEveryone immediately made a ruckus,\npointing and discussing, only accepting\nbarter. Then what about the money we\npaid? Will it be returned? You were\nscammers. Tranmax squeezed through the\ncrowd, looking around. Looks like\ntrouble again. The boy whispered\nanxiously. This time money is useless.\nWhat do you plan to do? He reassured\ndecisively. It's okay. I have a\ncountermeasure. Tramax stepped forward,\nraising a small object in his hand.\nGentlemen, look at this. This thing\nshould work better than money, right?\nThe guard exclaimed in surprise. This\npill is indeed extraordinary. He took\nthe pill, instructing, \"Please wait a\nmoment, sir. I'll go report\nimmediately.\" 10 minutes later, they\nreturned with smiles and invited. \"Sir,\nthe family head invites you.\" Tramax\nsmiled and said to the boy, \"I told you\nI had a way. Let's go.\" The guard led\nthem to a large backyard. Looking at the\nexquisite layout and meticulous carvings\ninside, Tranmack nodded in assessment.\nMedicine King Hall looks quite\nmagnificent. He was surprised to realize\nthat there were quite a few people\narriving. The two of them stood before\nthe door of medicine king hall. The\ncurrent head of the Mock family, Mock\nTrihawk, was sitting high up to receive\nthem. Tryhawk asked sternly. Was that\npill just now refined by your master?\nNo. Tranmack confidently pointed at\nhimself. I refined it myself. The big\nshots around discussed animatedly. He's\nso young, but can refined top quality\nspiritual medicine? If this gets out,\nwhere will our medicine king valley hide\nits face? It's truly a blow. He cupuffed\nhis hands respectfully and asked\ncarefully, \"May I ask for your esteemed\nname, sir? What business do you have\ncoming to our medicine king valley?\"\nTranmack smiled, simply reversing his\nname to introduce himself. \"My name is\nMtran. I came a medicine king valley to\nfind some medicinal ingredients.\"\nTryhawk laughed and said, \"Then you've\ncome to the right place. What exactly do\nyou need?\" Tranmac thought to himself,\n\"The thing I want the name will\ndefinitely be different from on Emperor\nStar.\" Tranmack decisively suggested,\n\"Take me directly to the medicine\nwarehouse to have a look.\" A subordinate\nstepped out, annoyedly blocking the way.\n\"How can we do that?\" Our medicine king\nvalley's medicine warehouse is not\nsomewhere outsiders can just see\nwhenever they want. Tranmack smiled\ngently and proposed. \"Then how about we\nmake a trade?\" Tranmac took out a piece\nof paper. \"If the Mock family has what I\nneed, I can use the refining method for\nthat pill to exchange.\" Everyone was\nshocked, their jaws dropping in\nastonishment. What? The refining method?\nHe is willing to hand over the refining\nmethod? Wouldn't that mean we could\nrefine countless top grade spirit\nmedicines? This is truly a prodigal son,\nselling off ancestral property without\nblinking an eye. Lapduk worried inside,\nfeeling guilty. Although I don't know\nwhat the refining method is, looking at\nthese people's reactions, that method\nmust be extremely precious. He is doing\nthis for my father's illness. Trihawk\nhappily accepted the trade, but he also\nhad a condition. I accept this trade,\nbut you must send it to the pill room\nfirst for me to inspect the goods. Rest\nassured, I pledge on the honor of\nMedicine King Valley that we will\nabsolutely not copy or steal the\nrefining method. The subordinate beside\nhim calculated silently. One look and\nI'll remember it. So, this prescription\nwill belong to our medicine king valley.\nThe family head is being a bit shameless\nsaying this, but this prodigal son might\njust agree. And if he doesn't agree, the\nmethod to refine top grade spirit\nmedicine will fly away. Tranmack agreed\nwithout hesitation, casually tossing the\nprescription to him. He took just one\nglance and stammered in shock. Th this\nis the other grand doctors were also\nexcited, crowding around curiously. I\nwant to see too family head. Let me see.\nHe smiled and suggested. Little friend\nMac, this refining method of yours is\nindeed miraculous. We will go verify its\nauthenticity now. Please wait a moment.\nTranmack leisurely sat down on a chair\nwaving his hand. No problem. You guys\ntake your time. Hill refining room.\nTryhawk and a group of grand doctors\ncrowded into the refining room. If I'm\nnot mistaken, this must be a refining\nmethod passed down from ancient times.\nI'm afraid we might not have the\nmedicinal ingredients he wants. The\nperson beside him snickered, offering a\nplan, family head. Regardless of whether\nour mock family has what he wants or\nnot, this refining method must be kept.\nOthers also clamored in agreement.\nFamily head, no matter what, this\nrefining method cannot be returned.\nRight? Absolutely cannot return it. He\nthought for a moment then ordered you\nguys hurry and copy a version. Yes.\nTryhawk stroked his beard and\nspeculated. Moreover, looking at his\nattitude, he doesn't care about this\nrefining method at all, which means he\nhas even better things on him. Perhaps\neven refining methods for immortal\nmedicine. Everyone responded\nenthusiastically. The family head is\nright. That brat definitely has secrets\non him. That's right. We absolutely\ncannot let him leave medicine King\nValley. We must squeeze him dry. The\npill furnace let out a loud bang. Green\nsmoke rising. A subordinate happily\nbrought it out. Success. It's a success.\nTop grade spirit medicine. They admired\nit with praise. Refining successfully on\nthe first try. This refining method is\nindeed extraordinary. Absolutely an\nancient refining method. Outside, Tramac\nheard the noise just now, guessing must\nhave finished refining. The corner of\nTrihawk's mouth raised, reminding them\nlater. You guys coordinate with me. We\nmust definitely fleece this fat sheep.\nTranmack vaguely sensed his intention,\nonly smiling faintly and taking a sip of\ntea. He smiled and asked seriously.\nFamily head mock, \"What is the result?\"\nHe coughed, his face darkening as he\ntwisted the truth. It failed. That\nrefining method of yours basically\ncannot form a pill. It is clearly fake.\nThe subordinate beside him was startled.\nAbout to speak, family head but thought\nto himself, why is it like this? Does\nthe family head want to directly swindle\nthe refining method? How can he be so\ngreedy? Tranmack calmly reached out his\nhand since it didn't form a pill, then\nreturned the refining method to me.\nTryhawk sneered, \"Fine, what a pity.\" He\nreturned the prescription in his hand.\nTramax smiled and reminded, \"By the way,\nI used a little magic on this pill\nrefining method. You will immediately\nforget all content regarding the\nrefining method and any copies or images\nwill also disappear. The others looked\nblank, seemingly unaware of what had\nhappened. Is there really such magical\nart in the world? That's right. I don't\nremember anything anymore. Tryhawk was\nterrified. The pill was refined by you.\nYour impression of the refining method\nis the deepest. Surely you also. He\nshook his head. I've forgotten it all,\ntoo. Tramac coldly turned to say\ngoodbye. He and the group aggressively\nblocked the way. Wait. He turned around\nin confusion. Does Family Headmck have\nother business? He stammered, stating a\ncondition. Little friend Mac Tran.\nPerhaps the problem isn't with your\nrefining method, but rather we made a\nmistake during the refining just now, so\nit didn't form a pill. However, the\nvalue of that refining method is\nlimited. If you want to exchange for\nmedicinal ingredients from us, you must\nadd at least one more refining method\nfor top grade spirit medicine. Tranmack\nlaughed out loud as if hearing a comedy.\nHe directly raised his middle finger.\nFamily headmach truly knows no shame.\nAren't you afraid of dying from\novereating with such insatiable greed,\nhe gritted his teeth in anger, using\ntwisted logic. How bold you dare to\ninsult my medicine king valley today. If\nyou don't give my medicine king valley a\nreasonable explanation, don't dream of\nleaving. The people around looked at\neach other. Is he telling us to stop\nhim? They understood the tacid hint and\nstepped forward saying, that's right.\nThis brat dares to insult our medicine\nking valley. The servants aggressively\nrushed up to block the way. Family head.\nWait, he can't leave. He must give us a\nreasonable explanation. Teach him a\nlesson. Tranmack let out a disdainful O.\nWhat explanation do you want? For\nexample, all the pill refining methods\non me. Chinfong carefully opened his\nmouth to advise. Our medicine king\nvalley could become a top family in the\nalchemy world not by relying on refining\nmethods or spirit medicines but on the\nreputation accumulated by our ancestors.\nTryhawk was furious. Not only did he not\nlisten, but he also wanted to get\nphysical. Chinfong. This brat insulted\nmedicine king valley. If I don't give\nhim a lesson, what face do I have to\nmeet our ancestors? Chinfong weakly\nreminded one last time. Family head. Do\nnot be greedy. Do not let prophet blind\nyour eyes. Tryhawk sternly ordered.\nMockchinfong I use the status of family\nhead to order you step aside. He had to\nreluctantly retreat to the side,\nsighing. Our mock family is about to be\nruined in your hands, family head. He\nsneered. Brat, will you tie your hands\nand submit yourself or should we make a\nmove? Tranmack raised his hand and\nspewed out a mist, removing the disguise\ntechnique. I have never learned the\nskill of tying my hands and submitting.\nHe took one look and realized in horror\nthis face. You are Tramac. Tramac\ngrinned. It is me, Family Head. He\nangrily ordered. So it's you, the\nvillain who killed the Nom Kong family.\nMen, capture him for me. Chinfong was\nterrified and hurriedly rushed over to\nhold his arm. Family head, absolutely\nnot. You absolutely must not drag the\nwhole Mach family down. Tryhawk didn't\nlisten at all, shoving Chin Fong away\nhard. He had a heartbreaking\npremonition. The Mock family is afraid\nabout too. Tranmack smiled and said,\n\"What's wrong? Did I hit a sore spot?\nFinding a new excuse for your greed,\navenging the Nom Kung family, I can play\nalong with you.\" Tranmack rubbed lap\nDuke's head to reassure him. Close your\neyes if you're scared. The boy said\nfirmly, \"I'm not scared.\" Tryh Hawk\nrushed to attack with murderous intent.\n\"Brat hand over the refining method, and\nI might spare your life.\" Tramac threw a\nhook kick. Get lost. He was kicked\nflying backward. Chinfong shouted\nworriedly. Family head. The other\nsubordinates rushed up in anger. Damn\nit. Attack together. We have more\npeople. Tranmack glanced disdainfully at\nthis trash. Tranmack unleashed a series\nof punches, gifting each person a\nthunderous blow. All of you get lost.\nTran Mack condensed spiritual power,\nadding force to the final strike. The\nwhole group was blasted away, screaming\nmiserably. Medicine King Valley. Is this\nthe only skill you have? Tri Hawk\ngritted his teeth stubbornly. My MK\nfamily has a heritage of hundreds of\nyears. The foundation is not something\nyou can imagine. Good. Good. If you have\na guts, follow me. Tranmack agreed\nreadily. All right. I'm also very\ncurious what trump card and alchemy\nfamily with hundreds of years of\nheritage is hiding. He led Tranmack to a\nplace deep within medicine king valley.\nKneeling down respectfully and bowing.\nUnfilial descendant. Mock trihawk of the\nMock family respectfully invites the\nancestor to exit seclusion and resolve\nthe danger for the family. Tramac\nfrowned getting ready. The Mach family\nancestor, another old monster from\ninside, a figure opened the door and\nstepped out. Tryhawk was overjoyed.\nAncestor, the person before them was\nMach Hong Dao. He asked sternly, \"Which\ngeneration family head of the Mock\nfamily are you?\" Mock Tryh Hawk\nrespectfully reported ancestor. I'm the\n37th generation family head of the Mach\nfamily. Mock trihawk. He calculated the\n37th generation. That means I have been\nin seclusion for over 60 years. He was\nhorrified. One seclusion for over 60\nyears. Is the ancestor a god? Tranmack\nguessed silently. Emperor Star doesn't\nhave any cultivation method that allows\na martial artist to seclude himself for\ndecades at a time. It seems he used\npills to sustain himself. The old man\nturned to Tranmack with respect and\nasked, \"Fellow Daist, this old man is\nMach Hong Dao. May I ask how to address\nyour distinguished self?\" Tranmac\nreplied concisely, \"Master Tran.\" Hong\nDao assessed, \"Master? Arrogant and\nconceited. Lacking upbringing.\" Tranmack\nretorted bluntly without politeness. \"So\nthe upbringing of your mock family is\nplotting to steal other people's pill\nrefining methods.\" Tramac pointed at\nTrihawk's face and exposed him and\nshamelessly twisting black and white\ntoo. Hong Dao's face darkened as he\nchallenged. Brat, make your move. Let me\nsee what your backing is. The old man\nquickly assumed his stance. Preparing\nspiritual power, Tranax suddenly used\nthe heavenly silk not to punch upwards.\nTranmax terrifying overwhelming power\nexploded. Although the old man resisted,\nit was not worth mentioning and he was\nsent flying by a single punch. Tryhawk\nwas terrified. Ancestor Hung Dao\nclutched his chest and stood up,\nspeaking in a consiliatory tone. Brat,\nyou have some skill. Let's make a deal.\nLeave my Mock family and my Mock family\ncan let you take what you want. Tranmax\nsneered and questioned. I originally\nintended to trade fairly with your Mock\nfamily, but you guys play tricks on me.\nNow that I'm speaking with my fists, you\nwant to trade with me? Hong Dao warned\ncoldly. your distinguished self. If you\nrefuse to yield, then don't blame me for\nbeing ruthless. The old man took out a\nscroll from his chest. Tramac glanced at\nit, startled and alert. That filthy aura\nis definitely something extremely\npoisonous. Hong Dao threw the scroll\ninto the air, chanting loudly. The\neighth generation protector of the Mock\nfamily, Mach Hong Dao, to save the Mach\nfamily from danger, specially invokes\nthe mountain guarding Grand Array, the\n100 poison immortal devouring array.\nOpen. Tramac was startled. Misty white\ngas drifted in the air. Hong Dao's voice\nechoed. My Mach family's grand array\nwill only stop after the immortal\ndevouring vine has slaughtered and\ndevoured all living beings. You just\nstay there and wait for death. Labd Duk\nlooked around in horror, but saw no sign\nof the mock family members. Tranmack\nasked suspiciously, \"Immortal devouring\nvine?\" A clump of vines slowly extended\nfrom out of nowhere. Approaching him, a\nvine suddenly shot up, wrapping tightly\naround Tr's wrist. Sap flowed from where\nthe vine broke, looking poisonous.\nTramac quickly retrieved the heaven\nslashing sword. The sharp blade gently\nsliced through the vines, cutting them,\nbut very quickly they reconnected\nthemselves. Can't cut them. The 100\npoison immortal devouring array is\nindeed somewhat special. Tranmack took\nout a command token. To deal with\nplants, one must use fire. Tranmack\nmuttered a spell. Samadei true fire burn\nfor me. Mock trihawk asked anxiously.\nAncestor, how is that Brad doing? The\nold man laughed smugly. He is struggling\npainfully in my array. Maybe later he\nwill turn into a puddle of thick liquid.\nHe chuckled scratching his head and\nasking expectantly. Ancestor, that brat\nhas many rare spiritual medicines on\nhim, even elixir recipes. Do you have a\nway to get them? Mong Dao shook his\nhead. Impossible that brat will be eaten\nclean by the immortal devouring vine.\nNothing will be left. Matrihox side.\nThat's a pity. But suddenly, the\ntalisman in the old man's hand burned\nfiercely, shocking him. Finally, Makong\nDao's whole body was swallowed by the\nflames. Ancestor Machry Hawk held his\nhead in horror, looking confused. Huh?\nHow can this be? Tranmax stood outside,\nimparting knowledge. The hundred poison\nimmortal devouring array seems to have\nbeen broken. Mach tryhawk was horrified.\nTramac. He laughed coldly and ordered,\n\"Hurry and take me to your Mock family's\nmedicine warehouse.\" Mockry hawk\nterrified, reluctantly agreed. \"You\nokay, okay, okay, go follow me in front\nof the medicine warehouse.\" Mockry hawk\nsmiled welcomingly. This is where a\nmedicine king valley stores pills and\nmedicinal ingredients. Tranmack nodded\nin satisfaction, calling lab duk, \"Go in\nand have a look.\" The boy followed\nnervously behind. The medicine here can\nprobably cure father's illness, right?\nLap Duke marveled. Worthy of being the\nnumber one family in the alchemy world,\nthis storage room is amazing. But Tramac\nonly glanced at it directly ordering.\nThere's a second floor, too. Mock\ntrihawk stammered, unwillingly, saying,\n\"Wait, the second floor is the library\npavilion. There are no medicinal\ningredients.\" He coldly warned, \"I want\nto see it. Do you dare stop me?\" He felt\nheartbroken and agrieved. Just now he\nwanted to rob his pill recipe. Now he\nwants to loot his medicine king Valley\nClean. Tramac walked around, looked all\nover, and obsessed with disappointment.\nThe library pavilion is not small, but\nit's actually full of trash. Suddenly,\nhe sensed something. This ancient\nspiritual energy, Tramax stepped forward\nto check, flipping through a few pages\nof that book. Turns out this place was\nthe cultivation site of true man Dandin\n800 years ago. Tranmack raised his\neyebrows, turning his head to remind,\n\"Today is actually a good day. Your\nmedicine king valley has occupied\nsomeone else's cultivation site for\nhundreds of years. Today, it should be\nreturned.\" Mock Try hot broke out in a\ncold sweat from fear. Asking in shock,\n\"What are you saying? I don't\nunderstand. My medicine king valley has\nbeen passed down for hundreds of years.\nHow could it be occupied from someone\nelse?\" Mock trihawk, although in a weak\nposition, still stiffly argued.\nMoreover, even if this place was\nsomeone's cultivation site, if that\nperson has abandoned it, then this place\nbelongs to our mock family. Tranmack\nfrowned, speaking softly. True man Dan\nDen's testament is written very clearly.\nWhoever finds this testament first is\nthe master of medicine king valley.\nRight now, I'm a master of medicine king\nvalley. I give you three days to pack up\nand get out. He pointed angrily and\ncursed. Master Tran, you dare to seize\nmedicine king valley? Aren't you afraid\nof being besieged by the martial arts\nworld? Tranmax struck as fast as\nlightning, decisively and neatly,\nchopping at his neck with a palm. All\nright, I changed my mind. It's better to\nmake you get out immediately. Scene\nshifts to a secret realm deep within\nMedicine King Valley. Tranmack is using\nfire to break a protective barrier. A\nmournful cry came from inside. Lapduk\nsaid fearfully. Sounds like a child\ncrying. Could be a ghost. A small figure\nrushed out from inside. Tranmack\nimmediately chased after it. Want to\nrun? Just as Tran Mack was about to\ncatch it, the small thing suddenly\nchanged direction, causing him to miss.\nTranmack chuckled, praising, \"Very\nsmart, but you can't escape.\" Tranmack\nwaved his finger, casting a capture\nspell. A large net spread out, covering\nthat small thing completely. It jumped\naround in panic. \"Hey, hey, Tran Mack\ncontrolled his spiritual power to\nretract the net, and the thing was\ngradually sucked into the ring.\" Go in.\nLapduk asked curiously. What was that\nwhite shadow? Tranmack landed from the\nair explaining it is the water element\nessence of the five elements power.\nWater element is also formed by the\ncondensation of the purest water\nelemental energy in heaven and earth\nleft behind by the immortal who\ncultivated here before. The two slowly\nreturned to the main hall. Servants and\nsubordinates were discussing anxiously.\nDon't know how the family head is doing\nnow. Just heard a violent explosion.\nDon't worry, our medicine king valley\nwill definitely win. Tranmack coldly\ninterrupted them. Stop dreaming. Your\nancestor and family head are both dead.\nTranmack struted to the main seat,\ndarkened his face, and ordered. As for\nyou, if you don't want to die, get out\nof this medicine king valley. Those\npeople didn't know the situation,\nclamoring and cursing. That's not your\nseat. You must be talking nonsense. Get\ndown. On what grounds? Tranmack was\nannoyed by the noise and waved his hand.\nSharp spiritual power shot out like\nblades. Wherever it went, heads fell,\nblood flowing like a river. Tranmax\nseriously asked Machin Fong, \"Currently,\nthe Mock family's high-ranking members\nonly have you left. What do you choose?\"\nMockchin Fong hesitated, looking at the\nsubordinates behind him, thinking,\n\"Actually, I don't mind either way, but\nthe Mach family's descendants still need\nto rely on medicine king valley to\nsurvive.\" But in the end, Machin Fong\nmade up his mind, decisively kneeling\ndown. I am at master trans command. We\nare willing to submit, begging you to\nallow the Mach family members to\ncontinue living in Medicine King Valley.\nTransmax said with satisfaction, \"I\nindeed need someone to manage medicine\nking valley. I can also take out those\nrare pill recipes and spiritual\nmedicines for you so your mock family\ncan securely sit in the position of the\nnumber one family in the alchemy world.\"\nMachchin Fong was shocked. Master Tran,\nbut that Tramac didn't say much,\nemphasizing again. However, you must\nsubmit completely. Even if I want you to\ndie immediately, you must not hesitate\nat all. Can you do it? He and his\nsubordinates obediently accepted their\nfate, bowing their heads. I am willing\nto submit. From now on, I will only\nlisten to Master Tran, doing whatever is\ncommanded. Scene shifts to the hotel.\nTranmack gave the medicine to Lap Duk,\ninstructing, \"This is the spirit calming\norigin returning pill. Give it to your\nfather. It will take effect in half an\nhour.\" Lap Duk took the medicine,\nhurriedly giving it to the man lying on\nthe bed. \"Father, drink the medicine\nquickly.\" Tramax smiled and asked for\nthe boy's thoughts, \"Having witnessed\nquite a few things. Do you have any\nthoughts?\" Lapduk replied somewhat\nshyly. Before meeting you, apart from\nthe belief in saving my father, I had no\nattachment to this world. Tramac asked\ncuriously, \"Then what about after\nmeeting me?\" A look of excitement\nflashed in the boy's eyes. \"Now I seem\nto be full of curiosity about this\nworld, hoping I can become someone like\nyou.\" Tran Mack asked closely, \"Then you\nhave to leave your father. Can you bear\nit? You might have to be lonely all your\nlife. Can you endure this loneliness?\"\nThe boy fell silent, thinking seriously,\nand then said, \"If my father's illness\nis cured, then I have no more worries.\nAs for loneliness, I've long been used\nto it.\" Tramac pointed out, \"This is a\npath of no return. Once you step on it,\nfrom now on, you will be friends with\ndanger. If you don't advance, you will\nretreat. But you will possess\nextraordinary power and long life.\"\nLabduk was so excited, his face lit up.\n\"Really?\" I agree. Now is the final\nstep. Trax said seriously, \"Enter my\nsect. Honor me as your master. Obey my\nsect rules. If you violate them, I will\ndefinitely destroy your soul. Do you\nstill agree?\" Black aura began to rise\naround skulls leisurely wrapping around\nthe boy's legs, stunning him. Lapduk\nhesitated in confusion. \"I I Lapduk made\nup his mind, clenching his fists. I\nagree.\" As soon as the boy finished\nspeaking, those terrifying colorful\nauras also dissipated. Tranmax smiled\ngently with satisfaction. Kneel down and\npay respects to your master. The boy\nobediently knelt down respectfully\nsaying, \"Disciple Chu lap. Duke pays\nrespects to master.\" Tramac nodded. Good\ndisciple. Tramac helped the boy up.\nInstructing you can choose to stay and\nlive in medicine king valley or go to\nthe yinua lake villa. Your senior sister\nis there. Lapduk chose without\nhesitation. Disciple will temporarily\nstay in medicine king valley. Wait for\nfather to fully recover, then decide.\nTranmack pointed his finger at the boy's\nforehead, imparting a secret technique.\nThat's fine, too. This is the foundation\nestablishment cultivation method. Do not\nspread it out. Lapduk obediently obeyed.\nYes. After finishing the work, Tranmack\nwent to the office giving medicine to\nHassan. In here are foundation\nestablishment pills, one for each of\nthem. After eating, they won't be\nimpetuous anymore. Hassan asked\nanxiously. One foundation establishment\npill per person. Will it work? Do we\nneed to give a bit more? Tranmack\nchuckled. You think it's candy? Don't\nworry, it's enough. Having said that,\nTranmack turned and left, leaving a\nfaint sentence. Moreover, their strength\nwill increase again. Before long, they\nwill definitely become grand masters.\nHassan was endlessly astonished. 36\ngrand masters, a special forces team of\n36 martial arts grand masters. Oh my\ngod. He rested his chin on his hand,\nlaughing happily. This brat finally did\nsomething good. Suddenly, a phone call\ncame. Tranmac answered suspiciously. A\nhurried voice came from the other end.\nTranmack, I'm 22. How? Something\nhappened to Tunim in Fang Sun district.\nTranmack rushed over. What happened?\nTunim lay on the bed unconscious,\noccasionally coughing a few times.\nTanmak, you're finally here. He quickly\nrecounted the events of that day. Tunim\nsuddenly came to me covered in blood. I\ntold her to go to the hospital, but she\nrefused before falling unconscious. She\nonly told me to notify you immediately.\nI asked my aunt to help change her\nclothes and wipe her body. She said\nthere were no external wounds. Her\ninjuries are not on the outside. Tramac\nglanced over. Evaluating. This girl has\nactually reached the Grandmaster realm.\nTramac went over to help her up and\ninspect. Her meridians are in chaos.\nPills cannot cure this. I must restore\nher damaged meridians. Tranmack quickly\nsupported her and transmitted spiritual\npower. Tuhal looked confused, thinking\ncuriously. What is this legendary\ninternal energy healing? Half an hour\nlater, Tramax sat by the edge of the\nbed, exhaling in exhaustion. It's\nfinally done. Tuh how happily ran over\nto ask Tunim, \"You're awake. How do you\nfeel?\" Tunim smiled to reassure Tuh how\nI'm much better. Sorry for making you\nworry. At this moment, Tramax seriously\nasked Nepunim directly what exactly\nhappened. Nepunim sorrowfully recounted,\n\"My cultivation is the result of the\ndemon seed planted in my body by the\nsectmaster of the AM Linn sect years\nago. What else could happen?\" Because I\nrealized I only had martial arts\ncultivation but lacked cultivation\nknowledge. So, I wanted to go to some\nfamous mountains to try my luck to see\nif I could meet like-minded people. I\ndiscovered a strange place in the\nDalyong Mountains. And suddenly, three\nhigh-strength martial artists appeared\nand ambushed me. I couldn't resist, nor\ncould I escape. So, I had to enter that\nstrange place. What was even stranger\nwas that I could enter, but those three\nwho were stronger than me could not. But\nthat place was truly too dangerous. So,\nI had to pace back and forth on the\noutside, wanted to wait for those three\nto leave before departing. I waited\nthere for a night, saw that the three\nhad left, and then came out. But\nunexpectedly, those three hadn't left.\nThey were still ambushing outside,\nwaiting for me to come out. I was\nheavily injured, and only then did I\nmanage to escape. However, when I came\nout of that place, I had this extra\nthing on my hand. I don't know what it's\nfor. Take a look. Tranmack took the item\nto inspect. This is a piece of jade\nstoring the origin power of heaven and\nearth. It must be an identity jade\ntalisman, which is also the reason you\ncould enter. The spiritual energy is the\nsame as my storage bag is a void stone,\nright? Eat this pay you pill to\ncondition your body. That place might\nhave an opportunity. I must go take a\nlook. Tunim happily suggested, I will\nlead the way. The scene shifts to a\nsuspension bridge. Tunim pointed in a\ndirection. It's the mountain range\nahead. Tramac happily replied, let's go\nin. They saw two other people on the\nbridge. Tunim said suspiciously, \"Very\nfew people usually come here, but now\nthere are so many martial artists. It\nseems the news has been leaked. These\npeople are likely here for the void\nstone. Tramac calmly replied, \"It\ndoesn't matter. They search for theirs.\nWe search for ours. If they dare to\ncause trouble, just kill them.\" Arriving\nbefore a strange cave entrance, Tunim\nshouted, \"That's the place.\" Trax\nsuddenly dashed forward, calling to\nTunim, \"Follow quickly.\" Tunim quickly\nchased after, \"Okay, wait for me.\" The\ngroup of martial artists noticed and\nchased after. They discovered something.\nFollow quickly to see three old men\nstood on top of the cave talking to each\nother. That girl carrying the jade\ntalisman has come again and brought an\naccomplice. Truly not knowing the\nimmensity of heaven and earth. The three\njumped down landing right in front of\nTramac. One of them opened his mouth to\ngreet long time no see. Tunim frowned\nand shouted, \"Tran Mack, the ones who\ninjured me were them. The oneeyed old\nman suddenly rushed forward shouting\nhand over the J talisman. Tranmack\ncalculated silently, \"The strength of\nthese three should only be at the body\nprotection realm, but their aura is\nstronger than even the divine glimpse\nrealm.\" Why? Never mind. Just punch one\na test. This punch didn't feel like it\nhit a solid body at all. These three are\ndefinitely not ordinary martial artists.\nThe oneeyed old man was knocked back,\nslightly apprehensive. Which sex genius\nis this kid? Young, but possesses such\nstrength. The other two chatted, \"Third\nbrother, is it that you haven't been out\nfor a few years and have forgotten even\nbasic combat to actually be beaten back\nby a wet behind the ears brat? This kid\nis eccentric, likely also from the\nancient martial arts lineage like us.\"\nThe oldest man suddenly spoke up, \"Kid,\nwhich lineage are you from?\" Tramac\ndidn't answer, asking back, \"Which\nlineage are you from?\" The old man also\nanswered honestly, \"We are the Lang Van\nsect, one of the 12 sections. And you?\"\nTramac smiled. one of the 12 sex. In\nthat case, there's still many sex like\nyours, huh? The three old men flew into\na rage out of shame and rushed forward,\ndaring to mock us, Brad. You're not from\nthe ancient martial arts lineage. Go\ndie. Tranmack hurriedly pushed Neep\nChunim behind his back. Nepunim turned\nto run while reminding Tran Mack to be\ncareful. Tranmack calmly looked at the\nthree old men rushing over. A group of\nmartial artists just arriving happened\nto see this scene. There's a fight over\nthere. Looks like the entrance to Void\nMountain is right there. Tran Mack\nraised his hand, channeling true energy.\nSpiritual energy surged out like a\ntornado. Tran Mack gently swung a fist.\nThe three old men were immediately\nknocked flying. That old man gritted his\nteeth, saying hatefully, \"This brat.\"\nThe three old men stumbled on the ground\nfor a long time, unable to stand firm.\nThe three discussed, \"This brat is too\nstrong. Our ancient martial arts lineage\nhasn't emerged for a long time. I didn't\nexpect an outsider who isn't a martial\nartist to have such strength. What we do\nnow? Do we give up the jade talisman on\nthat girl? The leading old man gritted\nhis teeth and replied, \"Of course not.\"\nQuick, unleash the trump card. The three\ntalents sword array. The three flew into\nthe air, forming a circle. The\nsurrounding air became eerie, a\nwhirlwind gradually forming. A passing\nmartial artist exclaimed in horror,\n\"What move is that?\" Tramac observed\nwith interest. Interesting. Tramac\nwatched calmly. A giant sword had\nformed. Suddenly, it soared high to\naccumulate power. Nepchun anxiously\nreminded, \"Be careful.\" Before the words\nwere finished, the shout kill was heard.\nAnd at the same time, the giant sword\nslashed down. Tranmax slowly chanted.\n\"Heaven, mystic divine fist, first form,\nsevering mountains.\" A punch was thrown\nwith thunderous momentum. A loud\nexplosion rang out. Dust and smoke\nfilled the air. The three old men were\nblasted away while Tramac took two steps\nback. The three old men stared with wide\neyes and horror. This brat is\nunreasonably strong. Let's go quickly.\nReport to the sect master immediately.\nAt this moment, Tranmack pressed in on\nthe leading old man, saying coldly, \"Did\nI let you leave?\" That old man tried to\nforce a shout, \"What? You want to keep\nus here?\" Tranmack waved his hand\nwithout hesitation. \"That's right. Leave\nyour lies behind.\" Heaven mystic divine\nfist third form. The third brother\nhurriedly shouted, \"This is bad. Big\nbrother, go quickly. You go back and\nreport to the sem. We will fight him to\nthe death.\" Tranmack looked at the two\nrushing over without mercy, not knowing\nyour own strength. The two immediately\nvomited blood and were heavily injured.\nThe boss left his two companions behind,\nrunning for his life while murmuring\nguilty, \"Second brother, third brother,\nyou wait. My Lang Van sect will\ndefinitely avenge you. However, how\ncould Tramac let him escape easily? He\nlaunched a sword, piercing through the\nboss's body, saying coldly, \"You thought\nyou could leave?\" The boss's eyes\nwidened, falling down, blood still\nflowing from the corner of his mouth.\n\"How can this be?\" Tramac neatly\nfinished off the three people from the\nLang Van sect, dusting off his hands. At\nthis time, Nepunim walked over, asking\nworriedly, \"Are you okay? No problems.\"\nTranmack tilted his head to look at her,\nreplying calmly. I'm fine. You say it's\nthis place. Speaking of which, he pouted\nwith some suspicion. There are no\nspiritual energy fluctuations here. It\ndoesn't look like there's a barrier.\nNepunim said firmly. It is absolutely\nhere. I I definitely didn't remember\nwrongly. Seeing this, Tranmack rested\nhis chin in thought. I'm afraid Void\nMountain is a floating small world. Its\nspecific location and appearance time\nare completely random. Last time it was\nhere, next time it might not be. A few\ndays later, a cave appeared with a few\ncultivators. Nepunim and Tranmack stood\non a cliff not far away. Speaking up,\nTranmack, more and more people are\narriving. Tranmack looked down, replying\nindifferently. If others don't offend\nme, I won't offend them. If there is\nanyone impolite, I won't be lenient\neither. Then he turned around, handing\nover a jade talisman. Right, this is for\nyou. If you encounter life-threatening\ndanger, channel true energy into this\njade talisman. It can save your life.\nNepunim received it gratefully, saying,\n\"Okay, thank you.\" The next second, the\ntwo sat down, sensing the abundant\nspiritual energy around. After sitting\nfor a while, Nepunim felt a bit sore and\nstretched. Suddenly, a commotion came\nfrom the foot of the mountain. Nepunim\nstood up and walked over. Someone is\nfighting. A man's trembling cry for help\ncame from below. Help. Nepunim looked in\nthe direction of the cry. The situation\nwas unfolding in the valley below. Let's\ngo see. Below, a man was running for his\nlife in front. A group of blackclad\nassassins closely pursuing behind. He\nheld a jade tablet high in his hand and\nshouted, \"Whoever can protect me, I am\nwilling to give the void mountain\nidentity jade talisman.\" In a corner not\nfar away, Lie Tra and his two companions\nwere quietly observing the situation,\nthinking to themselves, \"The jade\ntalisman is precious, but we can't trade\nour lives for it. Getting the jade\ntalisman now would make one the target\nof everyone's attack. Everyone look\ncarefully.\" The man gritted his teeth,\nsweating like rain. Is there really no\none to stand up and help me? Fine, even\nif I throw it away, I won't give it to\nyou. After speaking, he threw the jade\ntablet far away with force. The words on\nthe Jade Talisman command tablet just as\nTranmac and Nepunim arrived to watch the\nexcitement. The Jade Talisman happened\nto fall right into Trram's hand.\nTranmack exclaimed with some surprise.\nHit the jackpot. Seeing this, that man\nsmiled and said, \"Your luck isn't bad.\nLet's just see if you have the ability\nto keep it.\" As soon as he finished\nspeaking, those assassins had chased the\nspot, glaring at Tranmack and shouting,\n\"Hand over the Jade talisman.\" On the\nother side, Lierake sneered looking at\nTranmack, opening his mouth to say, \"I\ndidn't expect you to be here, too.\nTramac, you have now grown to this\nextent.\" Tramac looked at the assassins,\nthen took out the jade talisman, saying,\n\"Give it to those three people.\" The\nassassins saw Tramax's action, rushed\nover furiously. Want to die? Kill him.\nTake back the jade talisman. Just a peak\ninner realm. Ant dares to be arrogant.\nTramac didn't say much. Wave his hand.\nuttered one word. Scram. Liter saw the\nassassins were critically injured in\njust one move. Secretly surprised, he\nseems not to have used full strength\nyet. Is he already this terrifying? Lit\nturned to his master asking, \"Master,\nthat what realm has that guy's\ncultivation reached?\" Liter's master\nheard this, used his demon eye to\nobserve, but shook his head. I can't see\nthrough it. This kid's cultivation\nmethod probably has a cultivation\nconcealing effect. Liter was so\nsurprised his voice got a bit louder.\nhis cultivation. Even you, master, can't\nsee through. His master saw lie was\nagitated, so he reassured. Rest assured,\nhe probably just has a weird technique.\nAt most, he's only at the Grandmaster\nbody protection realm, far inferior to\nmy divine glimpse realm. At this moment,\ndown in the western valley, void\nmountain appeared with a beam of green\nlight. Nearby, cultivators saw this and\ncaused a commotion. Void Mountain\nappeared. Quick, let's go this way.\nTramac finished dealing with the\nassassins. dot carefully instructed\nNepunim, \"You must follow closely beside\nme. Absolutely do not get lost.\" She\ndidn't ask much, just firmly nodded.\n\"Um, after ensuring safety, he took\nNepunim in first.\" Meanwhile, others\nwere still observing the surrounding\nsituation. \"Reach the foot of the\nmountain yet? Why is it all fog? Forget\nit. Just rushing and will solve it.\" A\nman frowned and muttered, \"Why does it\nfeel like there's a force in the fog\nstopping us from entering?\" Immediately\nafter, others tried to enter but failed.\nThey shouted strange I can't get in but\nsomeone got in. Is it related to the\nidentity jade talisman? Thus got\nattention immediately focused on Tramax\ngroup. Rob rob rob the identity jade\ntalisman. Rob those behind among them.\nSurely someone has the identity jade\ntalisman. Nepu neem hug tramax arm. A\nbit worried. Tranmac kroka wood. Those\npeople saw neep tuim's expression\nimmediately casting greedy looks. He\ndefinitely has it on him. He is the one\nwho just got the jade talisman. Tranmack\ncoldly said, \"Block me and die.\" As soon\nas the words fell, he waved his hand.\nAnd those people were cut into pieces.\nNepunim looked at him and sighed.\nTranmack, luckily, you also got a jade\ntalisman just now. I wouldn't dare go\ninto this mist alone. Tranmack kept an\nindifferent face, saying, \"It's okay.\nAnyway, as long as I want the jade\ntalisman, they wouldn't dare not give\nit.\" Walking for a while, Nepunim\nsuddenly stopped ahead. What's wrong? In\nfront of everyone appeared a pavilion\nwrapped in a barrier. Tranmax smirked,\nthinking, \"This place has strong\nspiritual power fluctuations. Indeed, an\nimmortal's cave dwelling.\" Nepunim\nlooked up at the pavilion, saying with\nsome fear, \"Tranmac, this palace is a\nbit gloomy and scary. How about we don't\ngo in?\" Tranmax saw through her\nfeelings, thinking she wasn't afraid,\nbut sensed the sole pressure from a\nhighle cultivator. Then he reassured,\n\"Don't worry. With me here, it will be\nfine.\" On the other side, the remaining\npeople had stepped up to explore the\npavilion. There is a formation here. If\nwe can't break the formation, no one can\nenter. Tramax stepped up, got smiling\namicably at them. Stop mumbling. No one\ncan break it. The next second, Tranmack\nraised his hand, channeled spiritual\npower, and shouted, \"Break!\" Those\npeople knew better and stood aside. But\ntheir eyes still held suspicion,\nwhispering loudly, \"What is this kid\nsaying? Does he think he can break the\nformation?\" Not knowing his own limits.\nThis formation, even with so many of us\njoining hands, couldn't be broken. He\nsays, \"Break and it breaks.\" But before\nthe words were finished, the formation\nwas actually broken. Everyone was\nstunned. He actually broke the\nformation. Really broke it. This is too\nimpressive. The large door opened wide,\nseemingly welcoming them. Tramac\nreminded, \"Let's go quickly.\" Everyone\nrushed in. Got everyone exclaiming, \"Oh\nmy god, the spiritual energy here is so\ndense. It's really a thousand times\ndenser than outside. No wonder people\nsay entering void mountain can make one\na grandmaster. Is it thanks to this\nspiritual energy? Nepunin breathed out\ncomfortably saying, \"Tranmack, the\nspiritual energy here is so good. So\ngood that I'm even a bit sleepy.\"\nTranmac tilted his head, looking at her,\nreminding just keep walking straight\nahead. Don't know when this place will\nclose. Must hurry to explore. Nepuni\nnodded. Me. Okay. On the other side,\nthose who followed and also started\nhaving ideas. Cultivating here yields\ntwice the result with half the effort.\nSoon strength will increase greatly.\nQuick, hurry up and cultivate. Tranmack\nglanced at them. Dot pursed his lips.\nSpiritual energy here is so dense. It\nwill definitely birth some powerful life\nforms. Want to cultivate peacefully? Up\nwith walking a few more steps, a monster\nappeared in front of them. Nepunim\ncovered her mouth in horror. That rat\nrevealed its true form, eyes red,\nlooking excitedly at the dinner before\nit. Several people observing the\nenvironment immediately stood up looking\nat it, casually assessing, \"What is\nthis? Seems like a super giant rat.\"\nNepunim covered her mouth in horror,\nsaying, \"What kind of monster is this?\"\nTranmac saw this slowly explained,\n\"Originally just a normal rat, but\nnourished by the spiritual energy here.\nOver a long time, it evolved into a\ndemon beast. Just then that the rat\nfrantically rushed over, scaring the\nsurrounding people into screaming. Oh my\ngod, it's rushing over. Tramax stood\nout, raised his fist, coldly looking at\nthat monster. Immediately after, a fist\ncontaining fire energy struck, making\nthe rat weak. The onlookers were full of\nadmiration. Too strong. We can't just\nstand and watch. Let's charge together.\nSaying that, but the rest also united\nand rushed up, shouting loudly. Tranmack\nrolled his eyes, calculating, \"Void\nMountain might close soon. Must quickly\nfind the opportunity. Can't waste time\nhere.\" Nepunim saw him motionless.\nCalled out, \"Tran Mack, are you okay?\"\nTranmack turned to look at her. Nodded\nslightly. We shouldn't stay here long,\nbut let's go quickly. Nepunim pointed\nbelow the pavilion, reminding Quick\nlook. Someone already ran ahead. Let's\ngo quickly, too. However, those people\nwere blocked as soon as they got close\nto the main door. They rarely assess the\nthings in front. What are these things?\nSomeone quickly discovered their origin.\nDot spoke up. These guys have the aura\nof the Grandmaster body protection\nrealm. Moreover, they aren't human. They\nare puppets. I'm afraid they're the\nguardians of this stone tower. They\nlooked at each other shouting with a\ncommon enemy. Fight. Everyone attack\ntogether. Destroy these guardians.\nTranmax saw everyone preparing to fight.\nDot looked at Neep Tunim instructing,\n\"I'm going too.\" Void Mountain can close\nat any time. Must hurry. You wait here.\nProtect yourself. Well, a while later,\nthey finally destroyed all the puppets,\nexclaiming, \"This stone tower used 12\nGrandmaster level puppets to guard.\nThere must be many good things hidden\ninside. The person behind pouted, \"Still\nhave to go.\" Nepunim looked at Tramac.\nDot. Willow browsed slightly furrowed,\nasking suspiciously, \"Are we going in?\"\nTramac crossed his arms, calmly replied,\n\"No rush. That place indeed has\nextremely strong spiritual power\nfluctuations, but also a stream of death\nenergy. As soon as the words fell, but\nthose who rushed and ran out scared out\nof their wits, screaming, \"They're\nghosts. Help!\" Tranmack then looked at\nher signaling, \"Go now. Let's go in and\nsee.\" Nepunin paused a bit, but asked\nback with some worry. \"Really? Didn't\nyou say no rush?\" Tran Mack took the\nlead, entering, arriving before an\naltar, opened his mouth, saying, \"Seems\nlike that. This is a place displaying\nsacrificial offerings. Nepunim curiously\nstepped up to examine can corrode metal\nitems yet has such holy spiritual power\nexactly how much time is needed 10,000\nyears or 100,000 years. Seeing her\nlooking entranced, Tranmac turned around\nsignaling, \"Go up to the second floor.\"\nNepunim looked around the second floor,\nstroking her chin, muttering, \"Why is\nthe second floor empty?\" Tramac heard so\nimmediately explained quickly because\nthis place is the dwelling of the\nsacrificed souls. Tramac looked towards\na hidden corner speaking come out stop\nhiding. Tunim was a bit confused opened\nher mouth to ask but Tranmax's icy voice\nrang out. If you don't refuse to appear\nvoluntarily then I will force you out. A\nspirit body appeared. It glared fiercely\nat Tranmac who is so bold. Nepunim was\nscared by this sudden appearance and\nslumped to the ground. Got terrified to\nthe extreme. There really is a ghost.\nThat spirit body is says Tranmac then\nstammered in surprise. You are you a\nsurvivor of the great war that year?\nTranmack stepped up calmly asking that\ngreat war. But how long has it been? The\nspirit pondered and replied too long. I\ndon't remember clearly anymore. Tranmack\nasked again. Then do you remember who\nwon in the end? The spirit hesitated a\nbit. There was no winner. Tranmack\ndidn't make it difficult for it. That\ndirectly changed the topic. Do you know\nwhere this place is? Hearing Tranmack\nremind that spirit was stunned wondering\nthis place. This place is the spirit\ntower. This place is the spirit tower.\nThen why am I here? The spirit didn't\nbelieve it. It panicked and brainwashed\nitself. Am I dead? No. Imposed. I'm a\nbite. How could I die? Who is it? Who\nkilled me? Abienne suddenly turned\nreddish gold. Attacked Tran Mack\nroaring. Pay with your life. Tranmack\nfrowned wearily signaling Tunim quickly\ngo upstairs I'll block him finish\nspeaking Tranmack immediately acted\nSamadei true fire nepunim also hurriedly\nran upstairs reaching the third floor\nboth had retreated safely went up first\nimmediately exclaimed oh my god why are\nthere so many spirit tablets read each\nname on the spirit tablets muting an\nlanten anen an faten on Ben. This is the\nspirit tower of the inf family. There's\nnothing here. Let's go. The two walked\nout again. The people outside saw them\nimmediately clamored asking, \"Are there\nreally ghosts inside? Did you get any\ntreasures?\" Tranmack put his hands in\nhis pockets, sighed, and replied, \"All\nare spirit tablets of dead people.\"\nNothing useful at all. The two walked\nout of the encirclement. Suddenly,\ninside the barrier, a few more people\nappeared, startling those who were\nalready inside. They looked at those\npeople. Seems like the entrance to Void\nMountain isn't just one. Tong Van\nPalace. Could this place be the cave\ndwelling of Daoist Thuang Tong? Daois\nThuang Tong was the last immortal of a\nthousand years ago. In current terms,\nlikely someone who broke through to the\ndivine realm. Nepunim looked at those\npeople, asked Tran Mack with a bit of\nconfusion. Why aren't these people going\nin? What are they standing here for?\nTranmack replied concisely, there's a\nformation. Nepunim raised her eyebrows,\nlooking puzzled. There's a formation\nhere, too. Why does everyone like\nsetting up formations in their places? A\ncharming girl stepped closer and asked,\n\"Since you recognize the formation at a\nglance, do you have a way to break it?\"\nTranmack lazily lifted his eyelids and\nasked, \"Who are you?\" That girl felt a\nbit interested, thinking to herself,\n\"Ordinary men look at me as if they want\nto swallow me whole, but he is\ndifferent.\" After a few seconds, the\ngirl introduced herself. I'm hot tin of\nthe fu sect and you tranmack lowered his\neyes answering indifferently not\nnecessary I don't want to know you but\nin his heart he thought this woman looks\nlike a scheming one at this moment a\ncultivator stepped forward the corners\nof his mouth twitching as he mocked\nunexpectedly hot tin of five vu one of\nthe four spirits of the ancient marshall\nfamilies also has a time when she gets\nthe cold shoulder hot tin shouted\nangrily cut the crap the girl smiled\nagain and stepped forward to strike up a\nconversation ation. Aren't you from an\nancient Marshall family? Transmac was\nunceremonious, replying bluntly, none of\nyour business, no matter how thick skin\nHot Tin was. She understood Tranmax's\nmeaning. She frowned unhappily,\nthinking, \"He dares to treat me like\nthis, but I don't know him well yet, so\nit's not convenient to turn hostile. How\nannoying.\" Her voice deepened. \"Sorry to\ndisturb.\" Seeing Tranmax's actions, the\npeople present all showed looks of\ndisdain, sizing him up and commenting,\n\"Kid, if you don't want to be struck\ndead by lightning, don't put on an act.\nWhat does he want to do? Can he break\nthe formation? Don't drag the beautiful\nlady down with you.\" Clear patterns\nappeared in Trram's eyes. Tramac\nthought. They can't see the patterns of\nthis formation at all. Tranmac hesitated\nnot a bit, striking a blow into the\ncenter of the formation. Tranmac\nthought, just a lightning attraction\narray. It seems this dowist thong tongue\nwasn't much. The spiritual energy of the\nformation seemed to be sucked into\nTranmax body. Tranmax side. Once the\nstored energy of this formation is\ndepleted, the array will break by\nitself. The formation was broken and a\nsolemn room appeared before their eyes.\nSeeing this, everyone opened their\nmouths wide in regret. There's no road\nahead. Is this the end of Void Mountain?\nIs this it? Nepunim looked around and\ncouldn't help muttering. spent so much\neffort just to see this tattered hall.\nTranmack walked ahead, speaking with\nhidden meaning. It's not that simple.\nWaiting for everyone to enter. The large\ndoor behind them slammed shut with a\nbang. Everyone's attention was focused\nthere. What happened? Who closed the\ndoor? Tranmack vigilantly protected\nTunim. Stay close to me. Seeing Tranmack\nlike this, she felt he was a bit\nhandsome, slightly dazed, and replied, a\nmach. A stream of spiritual energy\nhovered in midair, emitting a resentful\nsound. Why? Why did I clearly see that\ndoor but couldn't enter? Why? The\ncultivator stammered, a trace of fear\nflashing in his eyes. No. The figure of\na man appeared, sitting solemnly on the\nmain seat. This deity is the master of\nthis place. Some people recognized his\nidentity and exclaimed, \"He is Dowist\nthong tongue.\" Tranmack lazily lifted\nhis eyelids, softly evaluating, just a\nwisp of resentful remnant thought, yet\ndares to arrogantly call himself a\ndeity. Hearing Tranmax's words, Fuang\nTong couldn't help roaring, \"Nonsense! I\nam Fuang Tong. I'm not some resentment.\nI want to kill you.\" After speaking, he\njumped up from the chair and rushed\nover. Tramac remained motionless, waving\nhis hand. \"Scram!\" He was knocked to the\nground, retreating in panic, stammering.\nYou know, are you an ancient descendant?\nThen can you give me an answer? The\npeople who had just looked down on\nTramac, hearing thong tongues words,\nlooked at each other in horror. Ancient\ndescendant? Him? This kid? What does\nthat mean? Did you time travel here?\nTranmack put on a lazy appearance,\nthinking to himself. It seems that on\nEmperor Star, there once existed an\nextremely prosperous cultivation\ncivilization. The resentment of Dowist\nThuang Tong and the evil spirit and by\nTien both consider me a descendant of\nancient cultivators. A moment later,\nTranmack nodded in agreement. Ask Fuang\nTong gritted his teeth, sitting on the\nground and opening his mouth, my\nstrength back then had already broken\nthrough the divine realm, becoming an\nimmortal admired by all. But I knew that\nwas not the end, but only the beginning.\nHearing this, everyone immediately\ngathered to gossip. Breaking through the\ndivine realm is only the beginning. Then\nwhat are we who aren't even grand\nmasters? Turns out we really are ants.\nThong tongue held his head, continuing\ndejectedly. I clearly saw it, but no\nmatter what, I couldn't enter. Has the\nimmortal gate closed? Speaking of this,\nhe shouted excitedly. I am not resigned.\nI am not resigned. Tranmack tilted his\nhead to look at thwang tongue slowly\nreplying. I don't know what you saw, but\nthe immortal world is boundless. The\nimmortal world that can be seen with a\nnaked eye is basically not the immortal\nworld. His face stiffened, repeating\nthose words in his mouth. The immortal\nworld is boundless. The immortal world\nis boundless. The immortal world is\nboundless. At this moment, Fuang Tong\nwas like a madman, pointing viciously at\nTranmack. Kid, I'll kill you first, then\nslowly deal with these ants. Pick one\nwith decent roots to possess and be\nreborn, completing the unfinished wishes\nof my previous life. Tranmax sneered.\nThe arrangement is quite good, but can\nyou do it? Fuang Tong lowered his head,\nsaying in a deep voice, \"Go to hell.\"\nThe next second, powerful spiritual\nenergy erupted from his body, a gleam\nflashing in his eyes, activating a\nformation, heart devouring sword array.\nAs soon as the words fell, countless\nsword blades appeared, pointing straight\nat Tranmack, piercing through his entire\nbody. Nepunim turned pale with fright.\nLie Trake in the corner gloated\ninwardly. He died just like that. Good\nriddance. Seeing Tranmack pierced like a\nhedgehog. Fang tongue laughed\ntriumphantly. So what if you are an\nancient descendant? This great array was\nhanded down from ancient times. Even\nyour ancestors couldn't withstand it,\nlet alone you. The pupils in his eyes\nsuddenly contracted. Tranmax stood there\ncompletely unscathed, looking at him and\nsaying, \"Look carefully before you\nspeak.\" Nepunim covered her mouth,\nweeping with joy. \"Great, I knew you\nwould be fine.\" Seeing that Tramac\nwasn't dead yet, Lirech felt a bit\nregretful. Tranmack, just how many\ntricks do you have? Fuang tongue\ntrembled and retreated, stammering, \"You\nthis? How is this possible?\" Tranmack\nnarrowed his eyes, his gaze cold. My\npatience is not something you can\nimagine. Tramac frowned, gathering fire\nenergy into a fist. Heaven mystic divine\nfist first form, mountain breaker. As\nsoon as the words fell, the fist\ndescended like the claw of a ferocious\nbeast. Before everyone's eyes, thong\ntongue was burned until not even ash\nremained. His miserable screams of pain\nechoing through the room. Ah. Having\ndealt with this small character, Trax\nsighed, thinking just a whisp of\nresentment. Yet it could cultivate a\nphysical form. This dais thong tongue\nreally had some skill. Nepunim excitedly\nrushed over to hug Tranac. Tranmack,\nit's great that you're okay. Tranmack\nlooked at the little girl in his arms,\nhelplessly hugging her to comfort her.\nAll right, this place no longer has any\nvalue. Let's leave. As soon as her front\nfeet stepped out, the mountain collapsed\nthe next second. Nepunim opened her\nmouth wide in surprise, her spine\nchilling. Void Mountain actually\ncollapsed. We were almost buried inside.\nTranmack didn't hear Tunim clearly. He\npursed his lips in thought. Dowist\nthwang Tong clearly like the Mock family\nin Medicine King Valley was a latecomer\nwho occupied Void Mountain. That remnant\nsoul disappearing shouldn't have caused\nVoid Mountain to collapse. What exactly\nis going on? I have a bad premonition.\nTramac frowned, throwing this thought to\nthe back of his mind. Forget it. I'd\nbetter go do other things. Quandu\nairport. Tranmack and Chunim sat inside\nthinking, \"Half of the Thai family's\nfortune. I'm coming to collect it.\"\nEarly the next morning, Tranmack arrived\nin front of the villa. The driver\nstopped the car and introduced. Here we\nare. This is the Thai family's grand\nvilla in Quandu, considered a scenic\nspot of the clan. Tranmack ignored him\nand pushed the door to get out. The man\nopened his mouth in astonishment. \"Why\nare you getting out? Just looking from\nthe outside is enough. They won't let\nyou in.\" Tranmack didn't answer, lifting\nhis foot to walk inside, speaking\nloudly, \"Miss Tai, we meet again.\" Ty\nVan Na was sitting at her desk,\nexclaiming in surprise, \"It's you.\" The\nscene shifted to the living room. The\nmajestic voice of a middle-aged man rang\nout, \"Grandmaster Tran, I already know\nabout the matter between you and Van Na.\nThank you for saving my father, but if\nyou want to use this to threaten my Thai\nfamily, then you've miscalculated. You\nstate the actual price of the pill, and\nmy Thai family can pay double. But if\nyou want to talk about an exorbitant\nprice like half the family fortune, then\ndon't blame my Thai family for being\nunpolite. He was the head of the Thai\nfamily. Tyang on Tramac clearly heard\nthe threat in Taiong on's words. He\nraised his eyebrows saying coldly,\n\"Unpolite? Fine then, I want the money\nanymore. Give back the pill.\" Hearing\nthis, Ty Van Na narrowed her eyes. Huh?\nWhat do you mean? The pill has already\nbeen taken by my grandfather. Tranmack\nwas unceremonious, his eyes full of\nkilling intent, then pay with his life.\nHearing this, the Thai family members\nimmediately gritted their teeth in\nagitation. You want to die? Only Taiong\non remain calm in his chair, taking\nsomething out from his chest.\nGrandmaster TR, if negotiations fail,\nthen accept this challenge letter. This\nis a challenge from perfected being\nknock. He is the master of Grandmaster\nTuang, whom you killed earlier. He threw\nover a challenge letter saying\nprovocatively, \"If you can defeat Dowist\nKnock Long, then my Thai family will\naccept your conditions.\" Tranm didn't\nsay much. He used spiritual fire to burn\nthe letter to ashes, saying with a dark\nface, \"Fine, but I want to raise the\nstakes.\" Tai on narrowed his eyes,\nremaining calm on the surface. Speak.\nBut in his heart, he prayed for the kid\nin front of him to accept the challenge.\nYou are dead meat. Tranmack was\nunceremonious, arrogantly pointing at\nold master Tai. If I win, I want the\nentire property of your Thai family and\nthat old man's life, too. Tai on gritted\nhis teeth. He had never suffered such\nhumiliation. Bastard. Do you want to\nwipe out my Thai family? Tran Mack\nsnorted coldly, turned around, and\nlooked at him dangerously with narrowed\neyes. You didn't want to abide by the\nagreement and pay half the family\nfortune, but instead plotted against me\nand challenged me. This is the price to\npay. 3 days later, 9:00 at night, at the\nfoot of Mount Knock, long dozens of\nsupercars were parked at the base of the\nmountain. Sounds of animated discussion\nrang out. Kwandu's number one spell\nmaster fighting Master Tran of Kiang\nGeep. It will surely be spectacular. Who\nwill win? Dowist Knock Long hasn't taken\naction in over 10 years. What realm is\nhe at now? The peak of Mount Nong. The\nman opposite had one eye covered. The\ncorner of his mouth lifted. You are very\npunctual, Master Tran. I didn't expect\nyou to be so young. He was perfect at\nbeing knock. Tramac glanced at him and\noffered a polite remark. The spells you\ncultivate aren't bad. He smiled with\ninterest, waving his hand provocatively.\nMake your move. Let me see what the\nskills of your spell lineage are like.\nSeeing this, Knock Long didn't say much.\nLaunching a move directly, dragon\nbinding rope, Tramac was controlled by\nthe move. He glanced at Knock Long with\nsome surprise, praising, \"You are indeed\nstronger than the master I imagined.\"\nKnock Long didn't reply, focusing\nentirely on launching a fierce attack.\n\"Dragon Fist strike!\" Tranmac broke free\nfrom the restraint. He assumed a\ndefensive stance, his hands clenched\ninto fists. Just as Knockong's dragon\nfist strike arrived, he threw a punch to\nneutralize it accurately. Knock Long was\nstartled. He actually neutralized it so\neasily with one punch. What level has\nhis strength reached? Trramax stopped\njoking around, his lips moving slightly.\nMy turn. Powerful spiritual energy\nerupted. Heaven mystic divine fist first\nform. Severing mountains. Knock gritted\nhis teeth terrified inside. Too strong,\nbut he couldn't give up. He also cast a\nspell. Heavenly stems earthly scripture\nfirst form. Starry sky rampart. Tramax's\nfierce attack arrived, but Knock Long\nquickly set up a barrier to protect\nhimself. Even so, the shot from the\ncollision made him groan, barely holding\non. Tran Mack frowned in disbelief,\nmuttering. He actually blocked it. Tran\nMack decided not to let up. Astonishing\nspiritual energy radiated from him once\nagain. Heaven mystic divine fist second\nform swallowing rivers. On the other\nside, Nlong also unleashed a move.\nHeavenly stems, earthly scripture,\nsecond form, raging starfall. One punch\nand one strike descended, colliding\nsimultaneously. Terrifying destructive\npower spread in all directions. The\nspectators below naturally saw clearly\nand everyone exclaimed at surprise.\nPerfected being knock was indeed a\nfigure famous for many years. Master\nTran could actually fight on par with\nperfected being knock. He was also an\nabsolute powerhouse. Taian witnessed\nthis battle and only now felt fear. If\nperfected being knock loses, then our\nThai family is finished. No Long\nstaggered to his feet, panting heavily.\nHe thought to himself that he had used\ntwo techniques of the heavenly stems,\nearthly scripture, and still couldn't\nwin, even falling into a disadvantage.\nIt seemed he could only use the third\ntechnique, even if it would damage his\nbody. Thinking of this, he made up his\nmind, bit his finger, and unleashed a\nkilling move. Heavenly Stems's earthly\nscripture, third form, heavenly\nstarfall. Having spoken, a stream of\npower fusing spiritual energy and fresh\nblood surged from his palm. Tran Mack\nhigh above naturally sensed something\nshooting towards him. He looked up.\nKnock Long, pointing his finger at the\nblue sky. Master Tran, have a taste of\nthis move of mine. Open. Hundreds of\nstreams of blood spiritual energy rushed\ndown, besieging Tranmack layer upon\nlayer. Seeing this, Taong Anne's eyes\nflashed with relief. Tyena also thought\nsmugly. Master Tran is definitely dead\nthis time. Tranmack was unhurried.\nPowerful fire energy erupted on his arm.\nHeaven mystic divine fist third form\nsuppressing the universe. Tranmack\nraised his hand towards the sky. Knocks\nattacking stream of blood spiritual\nenergy was directly dispersed. The space\nfell into silence again. Having broken\nKnockong's attack, Tranmax's eyes were\ncold as he opened his mouth. The attack\nwas very strong, but it's not enough to\ndefeat me. Ty Van Knock covered her\nmouth, her face full of shock,\nstammering, he's still alive. Knock long\ncollapsed at this moment, mouth wide\nopen. This was the final blow and the\nstrongest blow. The power of the\nheavenly stems earthly scripture. He's\nactually unharmed. Tranmack crossed his\narms over his chest, sneering. If this\nis your full strength, then you've lost.\nThe corner of Knock Long's mouth\ntwitched. Admit defeat. Ha! Master Tran,\nthis is my Mount Knock Long. I will not\nlose. It seemed he had made a decision,\nwanting to use all his spiritual power\nto unleash the final blow. Disciple\nKnock Long borrows the power of the\nmyriad stars in the sky. Heavenly stems,\nearthly scripture, release all power.\nTranmack looked at him and sighed. The\ndivine book in Knock Long's hand flew up\nand at the same time his clear voice\nechoed through the space. An energy\nsphere containing powerful spiritual\nenergy was released, terrifying the\nspectators. What is going on? The\noppressive feeling brought by that power\nmade everyone unstable, falling to the\nground one after another. I really can't\nbreathe. This kind of pressure\ndescending from the sky. Seeing this\nformation, Tranmax's face stiffened and\nhe said in surprise, \"This is the power\nof heaven and earth. This is a grand\nformation left by an ancient\ncultivator.\" Seeing Tranmax's\nexpression, knock along became even more\nsmug. Myriad stars grand formation.\nAfter that magic formation was\ncompleted, the oppressive feeling became\neven stronger. Tramax still stood in\nplace, motionless. It seems I've been\nlocked onto by the grand formation. I\ncan't dodge. I can only meet it head-on.\nTramac did not panic at all. Use one\nmove to respond then. Heaven slash.\nHaving spoken, a massive stream of sword\nenergy was controlled by him. Meeting\nKnockong's heaven and earth formation. A\nman watching from the side looked at\nTranmack. Interest appearing in his\neyes. He actually wants to confront\nheaven and earth. He truly doesn't know\nlife from death. The sword energy flew\nstraight out. And the two forces\ncollided. The spectators gaped in\nhorror. What is that? Both have used\ntheir trump cards. It's too terrifying.\nNeither of these powers is something\nhuman strength can resist. That stream\nof sword energy was not destroyed. On\nthe contrary, it successfully blocked\nthe formation. Nlong's eyes widened in\ndisbelief. It actually blocked it. How\nis this possible? No, he's just trying\nto hold on. This is a grand formation\nleft from ancient times. Although I can\nonly bring out one/tenth of its power.\nIt's enough to sweep away all\npowerhouses on the Emperor Seed Star.\nTranmax sword energy was suddenly\nbounced back. Tyan Na was overjoyed. A\nray of hope flashing in her eyes. Master\nTran can't hold on anymore. The\nformation got closer and closer. The\nspectators sighed inwardly. They'd\nalready guessed the outcome. A mortal\nbody is ultimately hardpressed to resist\nheaven and earth. This myriad stars\ngrand formation is indeed formidable.\nI'm afraid even a divine realm\npowerhouse couldn't withstand it. Yet\nTranac remained calm and composed,\nsmiling in praise. This formation is\nindeed not bad. under everyone's\nattention. Tramac was hit directly by\nthat formation. Fire light flickered.\nThe young man's figure disappeared. The\nsmoke and dust cleared and a huge deep\npit appeared. Tramax's figure could no\nlonger be seen below. Knock breathed a\nsigh of relief. Under the myriad stars\ngrand formation, anyone would certainly\ndie. Tyena had a vicious look in her\neyes, hands on her hips, saying smugly,\n\"This damn guy, he's finally dead.\"\nSeveral members of the Thai family also\nsighed in relief, exclaiming, \"That's\nright. He's finally dead. The Thai\nfamily is saved.\" Just when everyone\nthought it was all over, a tremor came\nfrom the deep pit. The Thai family\nmembers were terrified. Huh? What's\nhappening? An earthquake? The next\nsecond, Tran Mack walked out of the pit\nunharmed. He landed gracefully on the\nground amidst the horrified gazes of\neveryone. Master, Master Tran, he he's\nstill not dead. Seeing Tran Mack\nunharmed, Knock Long stammered in\ndisbelief. \"You, you! How? How is this\npossible?\" Tran Mack glanced at him,\nsaying disdainfully, \"My ability is not\nsomething you can speculate on.\" Tran\nMack was too lazy to play with him\nanymore, waving his hand, died. Nlong's\nneck was struck, and his limp body fell\ndown. The spectators naturally noticed\nthe movement over here and cried out in\nalarm, \"Someone fell.\" Aqua the father\nand daughter of the Thai family gaped\ntheir faces written with terror. Dad\nperfected being knock is dead. Tramac\nlooked down at them from above ordering\ngo back and prepare. Tomorrow I will\ncome and take back what belongs to me.\nTai on collapsed onto the ground in\ndespair. The Thai family is finished.\nHearing the commotion, Ty Van Na\nhurriedly turned and ran over calling\ndad on the other side. After Tranmac\ndealt with Knock Long, he went straight\ntowards the J Dragon Temple. Seeing\nTranmack, several disciples in the\nJragon Temple were so scared that their\nwhole bodies trembled and they fled in\ndisarray. Tranmack walked around\ncasually thinking to himself, \"To be\nhonest, it was quite dangerous. If I\nhadn't cultivated the primordial\nindestructible body, completed the metal\nelement body and wood element body, and\nadditionally achieved minor success in\nthe water element body, I'm afraid I\nreally couldn't have withtood perfected\nbeing knock this time. You guys probably\ndon't mind if I search a bit, right?\nTranmack entered a room. Inside, many\njars and bottles emitting rich spiritual\nenergy were displayed. Indeed, a rich\nfortune. Just these spiritual medicines\nare enough for me to refine a body\nregenerating pill to recover from my\ninjuries. The next day at the Thai\nresidence, under the hateful gazes of\nthe Thai family members, Tran Mack\nwalked in. Those people tried to\nrestrain themselves. Only when Tran Mack\npassed by did they grit their teeth and\ncurse in their hearts, revealing\nresentment. Tran Mack didn't care at\nall. He went into the main living room\nand opened his mouth. Now I've come to\ntake back what belongs to me. One of\nthem couldn't stand Tranm's arrogant\nattitude anymore and yelled, \"On what\nbasis do you rob our Thai family of\neverything?\" Tranm glanced at him,\nreplying calmly. \"Very simple, because\nmy fist is bigger than your Thai\nfamilies. When your Thai family bullied\nothers, didn't you also rely on your\nfist being bigger than others?\" Old\nMaster Tai also appeared. He sat in the\nmain seat asking in a cautious tone,\n\"Master TR, is there really no way out?\"\nTranmack raised his eyebrows, replying\ncalmly. If you had kept your promise\nfrom the beginning, it wouldn't have\nevolved into today's result. It's all\ntoo late. Hearing this, old master Tai\ndidn't try to persuade or beg anymore.\nHe just made a request. Everything the\nThai family owns can be given to you,\nbut please show mercy and don't kill\nthem. Tranmack didn't look at him, his\ngaze averting slightly. As long as they\ndon't come to provoke me, I have no\ninterest in killing them. Hearing the\nsatisfactory answer, old master Tai\nnodded and smiled. Then I am at ease.\nHaving spoken, his pupils turned white.\nTranmack had taken back what belonged to\nhim. Tears rolled down old master Tai's\nface. Tyona rushed over in panic.\nGrinpa. The person beside old master Tai\nalso hurdly supported his cold body.\nFamily head. Tranmack lowered his hand\nspeaking coldly. This is the price to be\npaid. Taian trembled in pain, calling\nout, \"Father.\" Tramac ignored them,\nraising his voice. Now hand over all the\nThai family's assets. Tyong on seemed to\nstill not know his place. He clenched\nhis fists, his face full of hatred.\nDevil, how could I let you easily rob\nthe hundred-year foundation of my Thai\nfamily? Tranmack naturally couldn't be\nbothered to talk nonsense with this kind\nof person, directly taking action to\ndispose of him. You want to die, right?\nThen I will fulfill your wish. Ty Vena\nhad not yet recovered from the fear of\nlosing her grandfather and now even her\nfather was gone. Father Tranmax saw that\nthe powerful figures of the Thai family\nwere all dead and spoke again. Is there\nanyone left in the Thai family who can\ntake responsibility? If no one takes\nresponsibility just then a man raised\nhis hand, stuttering, I I am Tyion Quac.\nLet me take responsibility. Please don't\nkill anyone else. Seeing this, Tranmax\nsmiled with satisfaction, instructing\nTai on Quac, \"After handling all the\nThai family's assets, you will\ntemporarily manage the Thai family for\nme. Those who don't want to leave can\nstay and help. Those who perform well\ncan also have their personal assets\nreturned.\" Several people who had served\nthe Thai family for many years heard\nthis and patted their chests in relief.\n\"That's great. We don't have to worry\nabout wandering the streets anymore.\"\nJust now, we thought we were dead for\nsure. Suddenly, Tyan Na screamed, \"What\nare you doing? Do you remember who you\nare? He is just returning what\noriginally belonged to you. Do you have\nany backbone left?\" Tranmack frowned and\nglanced at the woman, paused for a\nmoment, then ordered again. \"If someone\nwants to cause trouble, you must handle\nit properly. If you can't do it, I will\nchange someone else to manage the Thai\nfamily for me.\"\nHe rubbed his hands, saying with a\nflattering look, \"Master Tran, please\nrest assured I know what to do.\" Tyang\nQuac heard her ask such a stupid\nquestion, gritted his teeth and said,\n\"What are you doing? You asked what I am\ndoing.\" Naturally, doing something to\nmake Master Tran happy. Tyena Na heard\nthis, glared, and shouted presumptuous.\n\"I am the eldest Miss of the Thai\nfamily.\" Thai Qua grinned as if hearing\nthe joke of the millennium. \"Eldest miss\nof the Thai family. Haha. Now the Thai\nfamily is decided by me. Do any of you\nwant to serve our eldest miss of the\nThai family a bit?\" A purple-haired\nyouth patted his shoulder and stepped\nforward. Second uncle, let me. He walked\nin front of Ty Van Na. She backed away\nin horror. What are you doing? He picked\nTyan up in one go. Teasingly replied,\n\"Cousin, I will let you enjoy it\nslowly.\" \"Haha!\" Ty Van Na struggled and\ncried, \"Let me go. Help! I'm also a\nmember of the Thai family.\" Tai Unquac\nnarrowed his eyes, gritting his teeth\nand cursing in a low voice. \"You still\nhave the face to say you are a member of\nthe Thai family? If you hadn't provoked\nMaster Tran, how could the Thai family\nhave fallen into this state today? You\njinx. The scene shifted late at night on\nMount Nong. Tranmax sat on the mountain\npeak, closing his eyes and focusing on\ncultivation. He thought to himself, from\nthe sixth level to the seventh level of\nchi condensation is a watershed of theqi\ncondensation realm, requiring a minor\nlightning tribulation. The medicinal\neffect of the body regeneration pill has\nbeen completely absorbed. I am about to\nbreak through to the seventh level ofqi\ncondensation. Just then, a bolt of\nlightning struck straight down from the\nsky. Tranmack did not dodge, but instead\nrushed up to meet it. Tranmack endured\nthe thunder and lightning with his whole\nbody feeling refreshed, sighing, others\navoid thunder and lightning like the\nplague, but I want to use thunder and\nlightning to temper my body. A moment\nlater, Tranmack returned to his original\nposition with tattered clothes. Tranmack\nlooked at the surging spiritual energy\nin his body, muttering to himself, \"Sure\nenough, after undergoing the lightning\ntribulation body tempering, my body and\nspiritual energy have become purer. Now\nmy strength is firmly at the seventh\nlevel ofqi condensation. Moreover, I\nhave reached the dragon transformation\nrealm early.\" A glint flashed in Tranmax\neyes. If I cultivate dragon\ntransformation to the limit, I will\npossess dragon might comparable to the\nbloodline of a purebred true dragon.\nTranmack looked at his tattered body,\nspeaking to himself again. Just the\npressure alone is enough to make those\nweak powerhouses unable to bear it. It's\njust that I need to prepare a few more\nsets of clothes in the future. After\nreturning and changing clothes, Tranax\nstood in the empty room in deep thought.\nSpeaking of which, it turns out that\nthere's a grand formation left by\nancient immortal cultivators on the dees\nwith star. Fortunately, Dowist knock\nstrength was not strong. Otherwise, I\nwould have been in danger. I must\nquickly master the primordial\nindestructible body. Tranmac raised the\nring on his hand. Gim singac\nordered spit out some deep sea origin\nstones for me. Kim Twe immediately spat\nout an origin stone. Uh, looking\nextremely lethargic, seeing its\nreluctant look. Tramac opened his mouth\nand said, \"All right, don't put on that\nlook anymore. Isn't it just wanting you\nto consume a bit of your own cultivation\nbase? I won't let you suffer a loss.\"\nThen Trook out a pill and gave it to Kim\nCintu. This gold crystal jade bead, it\nshould be your favorite thing to eat,\nright? Kim Cintu's eyes lit up, jumping\naround excitedly. Tramac threw it over,\nsmiling and saying to it, \"All right,\nall right.\" continued to spit out deep\nsea origin stones for me in the future.\nKim Cintu wagged its tail and rushed to\ncatch it. Eating ravenously, Tramac\nlooked at it, thinking to himself, \"If I\nfeed this little guy more food\ncontaining metal attribute origin power\nin the future, I wonder what realm it\nwill grow to.\" Pausing for a moment,\nTramac thought of something else. The\nmatter in Quandu has ended. However,\nbefore leaving, I still have to do\nsomething with the Thai family. In\nanother place by the roadside, a\nbeautiful girl sat in front of a bowl,\ncowtowing incessantly, her mouth weakly\nbegging. I beg you, please, please.\nTranmack stopped in front of the girl,\nopening his mouth to say, Ty van na. The\ngirl gritted her teeth, pulled her hat\ndown low, trying to suppress her\nsobbing. You mistook the person. Tranmac\nfelt she was also a bit pitiful, so he\nsquatted down and rubbed her head to\ncomfort her. What if I can let you start\nover? Tyan, not no longer hid, raised\nher head to look at him. her lips\nmoving. I believe you can, but are you\nreally willing? Tramax stood up, smiling\nand reaching out his hand to her. Life\nor death, prosperity or adversity lies\nwithin a single thought of mine. At the\nThai residence, Taiong Quac sat\nleisurely on the Grandmaster chair,\nsmoking a pipe. If I had known that\nrelying on Master TR could allow me to\nseize the Thai family later, I should\nhave urged him to find that Ty Van\nN to settle the score earlier. He was\ntriumphant. Master Tran is not here. The\nThai family and evenwandu are mine. As\nlong as I sell all these things, I can.\nBefore he could finish his words, a\nvoice rang out, interrupting his\nmonologue. Oh, what do you want to sell?\nTran Mack and Ty Van Na had returned,\ntaking in his self-satisfied display.\nTyang Quac's face immediately changed in\nhorror. Tran, Master Tran, you're here.\nAren't you going home? Tranmack looked\nat him mockingly. It seems you don't\nunderstand. I can give you power, and I\ncan also leave you with nothing. Tai\nYoung Quac still wanted to play dumb,\npretending not to understand what\nTranmack was saying. Ty Van Na then\nhelped him recall. You contacted foreign\nforces, wanted to sell out the Thai\nfamily and Quan do. She shouted loudly,\nbetraying Master Tran and Hasha. Your\nguts are really big. Tai Young Quac\ndared not admit his guilt. He insisted,\n\"This is definitely a misunderstanding.\nThis\nshe pointed at his face in anger. Do you\nknow what I was thinking when I was\nhumiliated by more than a dozen men in\nturns? Killing intent appeared in her\neyes. I wanted to use a knife to pierce\nyour chest. Go to hell. Having said\nthat, without waiting for him to\nexplain, she threw a knife forward,\npiercing straight through Taiw's chest.\nHe was stunned you. How could you?\nBefore he could finish his words, he\nfell down, blood flowing like a stream.\nTramac looked at Ty Van who had avenged\nher great enmity. She looked at Tranmack\nwith murderous intent. \"Since you taught\nme the cultivation method and let me\nbecome a martial artist, you surely\ndon't mind me killing a few more people,\nright?\" Tramac did not stop her, letting\nher leave. Tramac just stood aside and\nwaited. A moment later, miserable\nscreams rang out. \"H was arranged by\nTyang Quac that day. I didn't do it\nvoluntarily. Don't.\" It was Tyang Quac\nwho forced me. Help. Vana saw thee. I'm\nsaw thee. H eldest. The screams\ngradually became quieter, then stopped\nabruptly. Ty Van Na was covered in\nblood, standing in a room full of\ncorpses. When she returned in front of\nTrmac, Tr looked at her with\nsatisfaction. I'll let you be the head\nof the Thai family. Hold marshall power\nand command everyone. But from now on,\nyour life belongs to me. Absolutely no\nbetrayal is allowed. As soon as Tranm\nfinished speaking, Tyan Nan knelt down,\nshowing submission. I am willing. In a\nVIP waiting room at the airport, Tramac\nwas sitting when the phone rang. Tramac\nanswered, \"Hello, Miss Tong Dao.\" I\nknow. In the evening, on a certain\nstreet, people were coming and going\nnoisily. A beautiful young girl stood\nalone, seemingly waiting for someone,\nattracting the eyes of passers by. \"So\npretty, waiting for someone.\" Another\ngirl saw her and hurriedly asked, \"Da\nDao, why haven't you gone in yet?\"\n\"Young master and is looking for you,\nMiss Tuong.\" Dao hurriedly shook her\nhead in embarrassment. Milin, you know,\nI basically don't like young master and\nI absolutely don't want to have any\nrelationship with him. Milin sighed. I\nknow, but young master and won't let go.\nWhat can you do? She was also very\ntroubled. That is the eldest young\nmaster of the inf family in Tuin. You\ncan't resist. Tuong Dao shily said, \"As\nlong as he comes, there will be a way.\"\nJust as she finished speaking, she heard\nsomeone call Da Dao. She turned around\nhappily, seeing Tranm waving at her.\nTram Mac finally waited for you. My\nLinux claim, huh? In surprise. Tuong Dao\nintimately linked arms with Tram Mac.\nThank you for agreeing to my request,\npretending to be my boyfriend to act as\na shield for me. Milin was dumbfounded\nand pointed the two. Huh? This is your\nmethod? It's him. Tranmack looked at\nTong Dao. What's wrong? Am I not worthy?\nTranmack said confidently. Don't worry.\nI will try to be his standard boyfriend.\nTong Dao blushed. Thank you. Tranmack\nquietly looked at her. The smile on his\nface disappeared. Tranmack thought to\nhimself, \"I naturally understand Tuong\nDao's feelings for me, but I am destined\nto go against the heavens and search for\nmy little junior sister, so I can only\npretend to know nothing.\" My Lynn\nhurriedly pulled Tuang Dao over,\nwhispering in her ear. \"People want to\nbe your shield could line up around the\nuniversity district, and in the end, you\nfound a guy like this.\" Tuang Dao looked\nat her friend with dissatisfaction. You\ndon't understand. Tranmack is the best\ncandidate. Milin looked at Tranmack\nhelplessly. Exclamation: This guy Tran\nMack is about to be out of luck. Milin's\nattitude made the two of them extremely\nconfused. Inside the building, everyone\ngathered happily together. Two people\napproached and Lang Hoa to strike up a\nconversation. The man opened his mouth\nto speak. Young master and why isn't\nschool beauty to going with you? The\nwoman accompanying him also chimed in.\nThat's right. This is the best\nopportunity for young master and to\ndeclare sovereignty. They pretended to\nbe angry. If the great school beauty\nTuong doesn't come, then that's really\nnot giving young master in any face. And\nLang Hoa calmly glanced at his watch.\nDon't rush. A good show is worth the\nwait. The two looked towards the door\nand hurriedly said, \"Look, the great\nschool beauty Tuong is here. Who is the\nperson next to her?\" The man from before\nmocked again. Young master and since\nwhen did you lose your sovereignty? The\nwoman also joined in. You couldn't even\nkeep a mobile flower vase. And Lang Hoa\nappeared elegant and gentle on the\noutside, but in reality, he was angered\nby the mockery of those two. Tuang Dao\nactually dared to bring an outsider to\nthe class reunion. What does she mean?\nRejecting me or does she want to attract\nmy attention? Another guy wearing\nglasses walked up to Langgho, young\nmaster. And Lang Hoa whispered, \"Call a\nfew people to kick that guy out, but\ndon't make a big scene. Don't make Tuang\nDao angry.\" Then he approached Tuang\nDao. Tuang Dao, young master and has\nbeen waiting for you for a long time.\nLet me take you over there. He glanced\nat Tranmack, his tone extremely\ncontemptuous. He's not from our school\neither. We won't keep him. Tuong Dao was\nfurious. She immediately pulled\nTranmax's hand, intending to leave. Then\nwe'll go somewhere else to talk, Tran\nMack. Let's go. And Lang Hoa then\nhurriedly spoke up. Wait. He pretended\nto be generous and stopped her since\nhe's a friend of Dao Dao. Then stay and\njoin the gathering. Getting to know one\nmore friend isn't a bad thing. Everyone\nstarted whispering. Young master and\nreally treats the great school beauty\nTuang differently. It makes people a bit\njealous. Young master and is truly\nclassy. Everyone praised and lang hoa\nfor his generosity and class. Tramac\nlooked at Tuang Dao comfortably. Then\nlet's just stay and see what kind of\nshow is on. He thought to himself, if I\njust leave simply like this, Tong Dao's\nlife in the future will be even harder.\nThe glasses guy couldn't chase Tranmack\naway, extremely annoyed, still shameless\nenough to stay. Tranmack glanced at him.\nScram. Suddenly, an illusion of an azure\ndragon appeared before that guy's eyes,\nscaring him out of his wits, seeing him\nfrightened into falling on the ground\nand laying hoe mocked. Your guts are too\nsmall. He was a bit annoyed. The other\nperson just said the word scram and it\nalready scared you like this. Then he\nturned to shout at the others. What are\nyou still staring for? Hurry up and help\nhim up. The glasses guy was still\nterrified. He looked at and Lang Hoa\ntrembling young master and that guy\ndefinitely knows sorcery. Seeing him\nscared like that and Lang Hoa was also a\nbit suspicious thinking sorcery. Could\nthis guy be an ancient martial artist?\nThen I can't deal with him temporarily.\nI have to change the time and place.\nAfter dealing with that guy, he turned\nto everyone smiling. All right, we\nshould still focus on the class reunion.\nHope everyone is fun. People around\nshouted young master and is generous.\nThere was no shortage of people wanting\nto flatter in Langghoa. Young master in\nthe annual twokin summit is about to be\nheld. Will you definitely participate?\nSigh. I really want to go and broaden my\nhorizons. This made him extremely\nsatisfied. He generously told them. No\nproblem. Whoever wants to go, just tell\nme. I'll get you in. Young master and is\namazing. Truly top tier connections. The\ntwo people continued to flatter. Great.\nWe can meet a lot of tycoons and\ncelebrities. Tuong Dao didn't understand\nso she turned to ask Tramac toqin summit\nis it like theqin ang summit Tramac\nreplied correct correct actually it's\njust a bunch of rich people gathering in\none place having a meal socializing a\nbit and discussing cooperation Tuang Dao\nfrowned losing interest then it's\nmeaningless and Lang Hoa had always been\npaying attention to the situation on\nTuang Dao's side hearing this he was\nvery surprised she's actually not\ninterested in the Tukin summit tactfully\nsmooth things over. She hugged Tuang\nDao's arm, acting spoiled. The Tuin\nSummit is the biggest event in Tuin.\nThere are many celebrities and tycoons.\nI really want to go. Can you go with me?\nTong Dao turned to Tramac. What do you\nthink? Tramac was very casual. Then I'll\ngo with you to take a look. Tong Dao\nthen turned to my Lin. All right then.\nShe happily said, great. I knew Da Dao\nwas the best. You definitely wouldn't\nleave me alone. And Lang Hoa achieved\nhis goal. Extremely satisfied. thinking\nthe two kin summit is my home turf.\nWatch how I play you to death. At the\ntwo kin summit venue and Lang Hoa led a\nfew people inside. They were completely\noverwhelmed. This place is really big.\nReally not bad. These words made in Lang\nHoa extremely satisfied. Milin looked\naround enviously. Doubt Dao. My father\ndreams of attending the two kin summit\nbut he isn't qualified. I didn't expect\nto be able to enter today. Although Tong\nDao didn't care much, she still looked\nat her friend happily. Look how excited\nyou are. Tranmack walked behind the two.\nSuddenly someone called him. You stop.\nManager Lou of the two kin summit walked\nover frowning and pointing at Tranmack's\nface. Someone reported that you stole\nsomething. Follow us immediately to the\npolice station to assist in the\ninvestigation. Tranmac was still\nbewildered. The other person glared at\nhim furiously. Huh? I'm talking to you.\nTuang Dao was extremely surprised. Huh?\nWhat's going on? Even my Lynn was\nstunned. This must be a\nmisunderstanding.\nMilin looked towards him then realized\nthis was intentionally arranged by young\nmasterin. Tramac looked straight at\nmanager Lou. You aren't qualified to\nprovoke me. Call your boss to come here\npersonally. The guy was so angry he\ncalled for people. I'm not qualified.\nEveryone deal with him for me. His\nsubordinates were about to rush up to\nforcibly restrain Tran Mac, but before\nthey could even touch him, they were\nblasted away. Tramax sneered. You want\nto die? Scared by his aura, the guys who\nwere aggressive just now were now\nkneeling on the ground, begging, \"Ah,\nspare. Spare my life. Don't kill me.\nHelp. What is this about?\" Seeing this\nscene, everyone's attitude changed\ncompletely. Does that guy know how to\nuse magic? No. It's sorcery. And Lang\nHoa hurriedly led people out to stop it.\nEnough. Everyone get up for me. A bunch\nof disgraceful embarrassments. He looked\nat Tran Mack mockingly. Your guts aren't\nsmall. Daring to cause trouble here.\nTuang Dao couldn't stand him bullying\npeople with his power. She indignantly\nquestioned and Langghoa. You arranged\nthis, right? You forced Tranmack to act.\nHe didn't refute, just turned around and\nsaid to the person behind, \"Mr. Lamb,\nplease take action. Maintain the order\nof the summit.\" The man laughed. That is\nnatural. The person called Mr. Lamb\nlooked at Tranmack contemptuously, \"Kid,\nI know you're a martial artist, but\nthere are people beyond people and\nheavens beyond heavens. If you kneel\ndown now and beg. Before he could finish\nhis sentence, Tranmack punched him\nflying, adding his sentence. Too much\ntalk. Tranmack withdrew his hand. A\nblack hole appeared on his palm. People\naround buzzed with discussion. What?\nThis guy is actually so formidable. No\nwonder he dares to confront and\nLangghoa. And Lang Hoa turned angry from\nembarrassment. This time not hiding it\nanymore. I underestimated you. However,\ndaring to hit people at the summit, I\ndon't need to take action. Someone will\nnaturally punish you. A female voice\nrang out. Who dares to cause trouble\nhere? Immediately, everyone's attention\nwas attracted. The newcomer was a girl\nwith a hot figure. She led bodyguards\ninto the crowd. Everyone started\nwhispering again. Tanoi Yetna is here.\nThe eldest young lady of the Ta family.\nThe Ta family is in charge of order for\nthis conference. They are also a\nprestigious family not inferior to the\ninf family. and Langghoa saw someone\ncoming immediately pointed at Tranmack\nangrily accusing him. Tuang Dao\nhurriedly scolded him. You are\nmaliciously slandering. Milan also\ncouldn't hold back anymore. It was\nclearly you who brought people to cause\ntrouble with Tran Mack. Tranac was just\nacting in self-defense. Tanoyet Na\nlooked at Tramac. She held up a photo on\nher phone to compare a bit then cheered\nhappily. It really is you. She quickly\nknelt down to pay respects. Ta family's\nt no yet na pays respects to grandmaster\ntran tranmax stood up in surprise do you\nknow me tan noyet na explained before\nyou crushed son tonahon's conspiracy and\nsaved the families in two kin our ta\nfamily received the greatest grace from\nyou were the benefactor of the ta family\nand laying ho saw this scene and turned\npale with horror you are grandmaster\ntran tang\nglancing at him with disdain you are\nfrom the inf family yet you don't know\ngrandmaster Mr. Trans face and even want\nto frame him. Aren't you afraid uncle\nand will break your legs? I'm laying ho\nwas still stubborn. If you want to be\nhis running dog, then go ahead. Don't\ndrag me into it. Wall was noisy over\nhere. Suddenly a majestic voice was\nheard. Impedent. The person arriving was\nan Lang Hoa's father and theaton. He\nlooked furiously at his stupid son.\nAccording to what you said, am I also a\nrunning dog in your mouth? when\nparticipating in the two kin summit and\nLang Hoa wanted to humiliate Tranmack\nbut didn't expect to make things so big\nthat his father and the ton also had to\nshow up and Lang Hoa hurriedly explained\ndad what I said is all true but the ton\nwasn't a fool this brat he only needed\none look to know what his precious son\nhad caused you really don't know how the\nword death is written and Langgho still\ntried hard to justify but Natan didn't\npay attention to him anymore he changed\nhis expression to a smile walked towards\nTranmack and bowed to pay respects. And\nNatan pays respects to Grandmaster TR.\nThe subordinates behind him also\nclamorred to greet. Pays respects to\nGrandmaster Tran. Pays respects to\nGrandmaster Tran. He turned his head to\nlook at him. Lang Hoa, shouting loudly.\nBastard. Why don't you hurry over here\nand cow to admit your mistake to\nGrandmaster TR? The crowd of onlookers\naround got to watch a good show to their\nheart's content this time. Cowtowing to\nadmit a mistake. What an explosive\nscene. ate enough drama today. Milin was\nmade dizzy by these successive plot\ntwists. What is the situation now? Young\nmaster and has to cow out and admit his\nmistake to tra\nonly felt satisfied, truly deserved. And\nLang Hoa was still extremely stubborn.\nMake me cow and admit my mistake to him.\nAbsolutely.\nI'd rather die. Anaton helplessly\nscolded. You think Grandmaster TR\ndoesn't dare to kill you? You bastard.\nAfter scolding his son, he hurriedly\nturned to beg Tran Mack. Grandmaster TR,\nI only have this one son. I beg you to\nspare his life. Tranmack pretended to be\ngenerous and said, \"For your sake, I\nwon't kill him. Just do as tono yet.\" Na\nsuggested earlier. Tranmack gently waved\nhis hand, breaking and Lang Ho's two\nlegs as a warning. As soon as the words\nfell, and Lang Hois legs felt like they\nwere slashed by a sharp weapon. He woke\nup screaming in pain. \"Ah, my legs. It\nhurts. Tranmack calmly said, \"If there's\na next time, you'll definitely die.\" And\nLang Hoa hugged his legs, rolling on the\nground in pain. And Natan hurriedly\ncalled out, \"You guys quickly take the\nyoung master to the hospital.\" Tranmac,\nhaving handled everything, turned to\nTuong Dao, \"Let's go.\" Tranmac thought\nto himself. This time, surely no one\nwill dare to harass Tuong Dao anymore.\nTuong Dao nodded happily. Although\nInaton was angry, he was truly\nfrightened by the scene just now and\ndared not provoke Tranmack further,\nhurriedly bowing to see him off,\nrespectfully sending off Grandmaster TR.\nRespectfully sending off Grandmaster\nTran, leaving the summit, Tranac went\nstraight to the airport. Tuong Dao was a\nbit reluctant to part with Tranmack, \"Do\nyou have to go back now?\" Tr replied,\n\"Wait for the winter break. We will meet\nagain in Saitang.\" Tuong Dao knew\nTransmac had made up his mind. sobbing.\nShe said, \"Um, let's decide on that\nthen. Be careful on your way.\" Tramac\nturned to leave. \"Okay.\" Tong Dao waved\ngoodbye, thinking in her heart. Tranmac,\nthank you. Boarding the plane, the\nflight attendants voice rang out.\nPassengers, please turn off your mobile\nphones and other communication devices\nto avoid interfering with the flight.\nTranmack hurriedly opened his phone to\ncheck notifications one last time. A\nmessage popped up. Heard that a\nspiritual medicine has appeared deep in\nNandang Mountain. Do you dare to come?\nTranmack looked at the phone with\ninterest. Although he didn't know who\nsent the message. If there was spiritual\nmedicine, he definitely had to go to Nan\nDang Mountain to check it out. At this\nmoment, Tranmack had arrived at the foot\nof the mountain. Tramax sighed. Although\nI can fly through the air now, it\nconsumes too much spiritual power. It\nseems I must quickly cultivate the\n10,000 swords technique to achieve the\nability to fly on a sword. Tranmack\nlooked towards a mountain peak.\nGenerally, heavenly treasures will\ngenerate intense spiritual power\nfluctuations. It seems to be over there.\nHaving identified the target, Tran Mack\nimmediately flew into the air, rushing\ntowards it. Suddenly, he saw two figures\nflying through the sky. It seemed others\nhad also found their way here. When Tran\nMack arrived at the edge of the valley,\nfor five people had already gathered.\nThey were staring intently at a flower\nbefore them. It's actually the nine-leaf\npurple heart orchid, a top grade among\npurple heart orchids. Tramac also wanted\nthis nine-leaf purple heart orchid. It\ncould condense the divine soul and dao\nbody, consolidating his cultivation\nfoundation. He definitely had to obtain\nit. However, Tramac was a bit\nsuspicious. Places where spiritual\nmedicines grow usually have guardian\nspirit beasts. So, why was there none\nhere? Tranmack arrived at Nandang\nMountain and coincidentally discovered a\nnine-leaf purple heart orchid. However,\nhe wasn't the only one who found it.\nWhile everyone was focused on observing\nthis divine medicine, the flower branch\nsuddenly glowed. Those present were\nexcited. The spiritual medicine has\nmatured. The fragrance of the mature\nspiritual medicine spread everywhere.\nExtremely alluring. A thisen is so\ncaptivating. Everyone wanted to quickly\nsnatch it. Suddenly, someone took action\nfirst. While everyone was still dazed by\nthe fragrance of the spiritual medicine,\nTranmack had nimly jumped down towards\nthe lake. Only then did everyone snap\nout of it and rush forward to compete.\nHe's too fast, seeing people with ill\nintentions. Tranmack quickly snapped his\nfingers, erecting a shield that covered\nhimself and the spiritual medicine.\nThose intending to snatch it were\nimmediately blasted away. Ouch. Get\nlost. Tranmack plucked the flower\nbranch, successfully obtaining it. After\nbeing plucked, the remaining part\nquickly withered. Suddenly, Tran Mack\nfelt something was wrong. A voice rang\nout. Tranmack finally caught you. Tran\nMack looked up. Behind him, a stream of\nwater appeared, instantly, obscuring\nhim. The people outside were completely\nconfused. What happened? What's the\nsituation? A figure from above\ncontrolled the water flow, activating an\narray. A giant water dragon appeared\nbefore Tran Mack. Only then did Trans\nTran Mack realize this was a trap. To\nnot hesitate, using a spiritual medicine\nto trap me. Tranmack clenched his fist,\nchanneling power, then rushed straight\nto the water dragon, punching it in two,\nturning it back into water. The\nremaining people hurriedly fled. Let's\ngo quickly. This isn't a place we can\nstay anymore. Run. Tranmack looked at\nthe person in front of him. Who are you?\nShe flipped her hair, mocking him.\nGrandmaster TR, only by surviving can\nyou understand the meaning. Just escape\nthis ancient cultivation demon array\nfirst, then we'll talk. Then she raised\nher hand to the sky, shouting loudly.\nHeavenly change. Azure dragon appears.\nBehind her, another water dragon\nimmediately appeared, even more majestic\nthan the previous one. Outwardly, she\nappeared calm, but internally she was\nexhausted. This Tran Mac is too\npowerful. Just activating the demon\narray has nearly consumed all the\nspiritual power in my body. But seeing\nTranmack alone, she became happy again.\nLet's see how you withstand this.\nTranmack looked at the demon array\nbefore him without wavering. He secretly\nobserved this ancient cultivation demon\narray. Who exactly is this woman?\nTranmack clased his hands together,\nthinking, \"Forget it. Let's just pass\nthis trial first.\" Then Tran's body was\nenveloped by a Buddhist statue, directly\nresisting the opponent's water dragon.\nThe opponent looked at Tranmack, feeling\na bit afraid. Does he think it ends like\nthis? She made up her mind. Tranmack,\ntaste the flavor of the one origin heavy\nwater that could destroy a cultivator's\ndivine soul. Tranmac was extremely\nsurprised. She actually possessed one\norigin heavy water. What exactly was her\nbackground? Tranmack thought,\n\"Currently, I don't have the four\nsymbols flowing gold earth yet, so I can\nonly barely resist.\" Trax struggled to\nblock the water dragon in front and the\nwalls of water around him. Suddenly,\nTranac's eyes lit up. He straightened\nup, pointing his finger at the sky.\nBehind him, a vertical beam of light\nappeared. Tramac raised his hand and\nshouted, \"Azure dragon overturning water\ndemon array.\" Then he slashed out\nseveral attacks towards the water dragon\nbreak. She began to feel the situation\nwas not right, disadvantageous to her.\nEven the azure dragon overturning water\ndemon array added with one origin heavy\nwater can't do anything to him. Saying\nthat, she turned to flee. Tranmack\ncalled her back. Who exactly are you?\nWhat is your purpose? Speak now. While\nfleeing, hearing Tran Matt call her, she\npaused for a moment, revealing a\nconfused expression. Huh? Not only did\nshe not answer, but as soon as she\nregained her composure, she turned her\nhead and continued running. Oof. Seeing\nher stubbornly fleeing, Tranmack raised\nhis hand and a platinum beam of light\nappeared, dotted with small red\nlightning bolts around it. Tranmack\nopened his mouth. Want to run? Then he\nshot that beam of light toward her.\nHowever, the beam of light had not yet\ntouched her when it was blocked by a\nshield she created. She smuggly turned\nher head to look at Tranmack, laughing.\nWant to keep me here in your next life?\nTranmack, facing this provocation,\nlaughed out of anger, saying that he\nwiped the blood from the corner of his\nmouth, frowning. The one origin heavy\nwater is indeed fierce. Although I coped\nwith it, I also let toxins invade my\nbody. I must heal first. Luckily, I used\na heaven severing sword to bluff,\nscaring her away, Tran Mack walked to a\nstone cave, deciding to choose this\nplace for healing. Tranmack let out a\nloud shout. Currently, Tran Mack was\nsitting cross-legged on the roots of a\nspiritual medicine plant, quietly\nrestoring his vitality in the cave. To\nquickly expel the toxins and restore\ncultivation, I can only risk using this\nspiritual medicine plant. A moment\nlater, some water floated in front of\nhim. Tranmack gently closed his eyes and\ndrank the water. Just after drinking,\nthe energy of this water source tore his\nclothes into small pieces. Tranmack\nfrowned inside. Huh? I must suppress\nthis uncontrolled spiritual power. At\nthis moment, a white light appeared\naround Tranmack with countless red\nstreams of spiritual power flying back\nand forth above. It's the metal\nattribute body attribute body and water\nattribute body. The mixed origin\nindestructible body hasn't been\ncultivated to great completion yet, but\nthis is enough to stabilize the violent\nspiritual power and help me restore my\ninjured body. Thinking of this, Tranmack\nreached out his hand, speaking up. Water\nelement spirit essence, come out. Open\nup for me to absorb spiritual power. As\nsoon as Tranm finished speaking, beams\nof light carrying blue glimmers flew\nquickly towards him. Now it's completely\nsuppressed. Next is absorbing spiritual\npower and recovering from injuries. Half\na month later, at a high-rise building,\nthe office of the chairman of my Hoa\nGroup. At this moment, the chairman was\nhaving a headache over company matters.\nBeside her was a pink-haired secretary\nwhose face was also full of worry. The\nchairman looked dejected. My hoa, this\ntime I'm afraid, is really done for. The\nsecretary beside her said worriedly and\nuneasily. This is a game set up by real\nestate and banks joining forces to harm\nIHOA. Before she could finish, the\nchairman cut in interrupting her. It's\nstill because our foundation is too weak\nto fight against the Lie family. Saying\nthat, she frowned, her face gloomy,\nthinking to herself, \"Father is so\ncruel.\" The secretary beside her\nsuddenly remembered something. She\nsmiled and said to the chairman, \"That's\nright, chairman. How about asking Lil\nMac? Maybe he has a way.\" Hearing this,\nthe chairman also shook her head\nhelplessly. We are facing a deficit of 5\nmillion. Little Mac knowing how to fight\nis useless. Just as she finished\nspeaking, someone walked into the\noffice. Tran Mack with hands in his\npockets and wearing white shoes. Walked\nin laughing. Mom, I'm not just a kid who\nknows how to fight. The secretary saw\nTran Mack enter and was very surprised.\nShe smiled happily. Little Mac, why are\nyou here? The chairman beside her saw\nher son arrive and also instinctively\nsmiled. Little Mac. Tranmack walked\nbehind the chair the chairman was\nsitting in. He gently placed his hands\non his mother's shoulders to comfort\nher, then reassured her, \"Mom, don't\nworry. Whatever happens, I will face it\nwith you.\" The chairman was very happy\nto hear this. She smiled and said, \"My\nson has grown up.\" Tranmack recalled the\nevents of half a month ago. He was\nstanding on a mountain when the phone in\nhis pocket suddenly rang, making him\ncurious. He looked at the notification\non the phone, read the sender's name,\nand blurted out, \"Quan Ha son. Surely\nnothing good.\" He picked up, speaking in\na cold tone. \"Leader, looking for me for\nsomething.\" The person on the other end\nbreathed a sigh of relief, seeing he\nfinally picked up finally got in touch\nwith you. I have two things to notify\nyou, saying that the person mentioned\nhis mother's matter, simultaneously\nwarning him not to interfere. First,\nyour mother's my Hoa group is currently\nstuck in a quagmire. This is purely\ncommercial competition. It's\ninconvenient for us to intervene and you\nabsolutely cannot use violence or kill\npeople to interfere. Hearing the other\nparty say this, Tranmack frowned but\nstill calmly replied, \"I know.\" After\nreceiving Tranmack's answer, the other\nparty continued. Second, after handling\nthis matter, \"Come find me. There is an\nimportant mission for you.\" Back to\nreality. Transmac was smiling, standing\nin the chairman's office, massaging his\nmother's shoulders. Although his face\nwas calm, his hand unconsciously\nclenched tight, causing his mother to\nremind him, \"Son, easy now.\" Tranmack\ndidn't reply. He frowned, the corner of\nhis mouth lifting into a dangerous\ncurve, thinking silently. No violence,\nno killing, no problem. I can crush you\nall with money, too. Tran Mack and his\nmother sat together on the sofa in the\nchairman's office with her secretary\nstanding nearby. The chairman looked\nsorrowful, turned to say to Tranmack,\n\"Little Mac, my hoa is probably about to\ngo bankrupt.\" A deficit of 5 billion,\n\"You can't make up for it. In the\nfuture, you The chairman hadn't finished\nher sentence when a knocking sound was\nheard from outside. Everyone in the room\nwas interrupted by the noise outside.\"\nLafang spoke up, \"Come in.\" Entering the\nroom was a balding middle-aged man. He\nrubbed his bald head while complaining\nabout his poverty. Chairman, I above me\nis an elderly mother. below are young\nchildren, rent, children's tuition,\nwife's pocket money. Hearing this, Lida\nFuang understood his intention. She\nimmediately replied, \"Director 2, I\nunderstand what you mean. Go to the\nfinance department to settle your\nsalary.\" As soon as she finished\nspeaking, the man looked miserable and\nknelt on the ground to apologize.\n\"Chairman, I'm sorry.\" Saying that, he\nstood up, turned, and left. The chairman\nwatched his retreating figure and said,\n\"Many people have left my Hoa these past\nfew days. Since salaries are reduced\nanyway, they will run to other\ncompanies. On Tin standing nearby felt\nextremely indignant at this disloyal\nbehavior of the company members. Seeing\nher like that, the chairman said, \"All\nright, go see who is currently still in\noffice. This time we cannot treat them\nunfairly.\" The secretary received the\norder, sighed, then politely replied,\n\"Yes.\" Suddenly, the phone rang. It was\nthe chairman's phone. She picked up\ngeneral director lie. On the other end\nwas lie to Fuang's eldest brother,\nTranmax's uncle, Li Lap Van. He raised\nhis eyebrows holding a pipe in his hand\nand said, \"Fourth sister getting to this\nstep.\" Eldest brother had no choice.\nHearing this, Lieong frowned unhappily.\nWinners are kings, losers are bandits. I\ncan afford to lose. General director lie\ndoesn't need to worry. Lie lap then\ndidn't give up. He continued, \"Fourth\nsister, are you refusing to call me\neldest brother?\" hearing him still have\nthe nerve to say these words. Lidafang\nimmediately couldn't contain her anger.\nThe eldest brother who personally\ndestroyed my company and forced me into\na dead end or the big brother who wants\nto beat and kill my son. Hearing lie to\nFuan's harsh words, Lap Van's initial\ncalmness disappeared immediately. He\nroared, fourth sister, don't be stubborn\nanymore. Leave that trash surname Tran.\nAdmit your mistake to father and\nreturning to the lie family is your only\nway out. Lafang on his side did not\nyield at all, shouting back loudly. Even\nif I die, I will absolutely not submit\nto him. I will absolutely not become a\npawn in his hands to be sacrificed at\nwill for the development of a lie\nfamily. Hearing the words about their\nfather, liap van's face twisted in\nextreme rage. Insolent you, however,\nwithout waiting for liabang\nhung up the phone. Beep. Lafang put the\nphone down inside. The secretary next to\nher spoke up. If there were five billion\nin capital injected in my Hoa Group now,\nnot only could the crisis be resolved,\nbut could also help my HOA group turn\ndefeat into victory. Unfortunately, it\nis impossible right now. Transmac\nsitting nearby holding his phone smiled\nand said, \"Why didn't you say so sooner?\nMom, I have a considerable sum of money\nhere. It should be enough for the\ncompany to use.\" Lie to Fuang and the\nsecretary were both extremely surprised\nhearing this. The two of them exclaimed,\n\"Huh?\" In unison, suddenly the office\nphone rang. Lie to Fuang hurriedly told\nthe secretary to answer it. The\nsecretary nervously picked up, \"Hello.\nHello. Greetings. Yes, yes, yes.\"\nSuddenly, she cried out in surprise.\nStartling lie to Fuang next to her. You\nsay you are willing to unconditionally\ninvest 5 billion in my hoa? Lida Fuang\nseemed unable to believe her ears and\nasked again what saying that she reached\nout to take the phone from the\nsecretary. Give me the phone. Let me\nlisten. Lafa Fuang listened to the\ninvestor on the phone overjoyed and\nsmiled as she replied. Hello, greetings.\nGood, good, good, good. We will come to\nmeet you to discuss immediately. Yes.\nYes. 1 hour later, Dide Bank. There were\nfour people in the room at that time\nincluding chairman Lie to Fuang, her\nSunran Mack, her secretary on Tin and\nanother investor. Lie to Fuang formally\nopened the conversation. It's unexpected\nthat there is still someone willing to\nhelp my ho at this time. The other party\nheard this and replied calmly, \"Don't be\npolite. This is all what I should do.\"\nHearing her say that, Li Fang couldn't\nhelp but be puzzled. Huh? Saying that,\nthat person turned to look at Tranmack,\neyes full of affection, face blushing\nwith shyness, causing Tranmack to feel a\nwave of confusion. Afterward, in the\noffice, Lida Fuang put her hands on her\nhips, angrily questioning Tram Mac.\nSpeak. What exactly is going on? She\ncouldn't help but suspect why that girl\nsaid it was what she should do. And\nmoreover, her expression was so strange\nwhen mentioning Little Mac. Suddenly, a\nthought occurred to her. Could it be\nyou're being kept by someone as a sugar\nbaby? Her question made the secretary\nnext to her blush as well while Tran\nMack was utterly speechless. Mom, how\nmany TV dramas have you watched? Tran\nMack looking horrified wave his hands\nrepeatedly. There's no such nonsense.\nDon't worry about that. First, think\nabout what to do next. Hearing Tran Mack\nsay that, she changed the subject,\ncoughing twice to speak to the\nsecretary. Ahem on tin block the news\nfirst. Lie to Fuang revealed a profound\nand mysterious expression. The deadline\nis in three days. We must slap the lie\nfamily in the face really hard. Three\ndays later, lie lap van along with\nchairman Vong and another person stood\nbefore lie to fuang in the chairman's\noffice. He said smuggly. Fourth sister,\nI ask you one more time, do you? Without\nwaiting for him to finish. Lie to Fuang\nangrily interrupted, shut your mouth.\nSeeing his sister's attitude remained\nfirm, Lap Van raised his eyebrows and\nsmiled. Since it's like this, don't\nblame me. Saying that, he glanced to\nsignal chairman Vong, making the latter\nstartle. He thought to himself, although\nlie to Fuang and I have been friend for\nmany years, I can't afford to offend the\nlie family either. Thinking this, he\nstepped forward wearing a troubled\nexpression as he said to lie to Fuang.\nChairman lie, today is the deadline for\ndebt repayment. If my Hoa group cannot\nproduce the capital, then I have no\nchoice but to follow regulations.\nHearing this, Lie to Fuang was not\nafraid. Instead, she was extremely\nconfident. She raised her eyebrows and\nasked with a smile, \"So, how much does\nour Mihoa need to pay in total?\" Seeing\nlie to Fuang's calm demeanor. Chairman\nVaugh was extremely surprised. His heart\nstirred so calm. Could she have found\nthe money? But on the surface, he\nremained calm, answering her. Then,\nholding a piece of paper, he stood in\nfront of lie to Fuang and read, \"My Hoa\nGroup needs to repay 43.895 895 billion\nbut current asset valuation is 20.18\nbillion. Therefore, even if my HOA group\nis taken, you still need to repay more\nthan 10 billion in debt. If you cannot\npay, we will follow legal procedures.\nI'm afraid you'll have to go to jail.\nHearing chairman Vong finish reading,\nLap Van thought he had forced his sister\ninto a desperate situation. So, he\nsmuggly said, \"Fourth sister, my\nconditions are still valid, contrary to\nhis expectations.\" Lie to Fuang said\nwith immense confidence, wanting to take\naway my Mayoa and also wanting to send\nme to jail. Truly greedy indeed. As soon\nas she finished speaking, Antin walked\nin from outside, smiling as she reported\nto her, \"Chairman, it is ready.\" Hearing\nthat, Lafa Fuang smiled and said, \"Good.\nPlease check the check, Chairman Vong.\"\nContrasting with her smile was lie lap\nVan's face full of anger. Chairman Vong\nwalked towards Antinin, took the\ndocument from her hand and said with a\nsmile, \"So you really gathered the\ncapital.\" Anton also smiled back at him.\n\"Yes, please check it, sir.\" As soon as\nhe picked up the document and glanced at\nit, Chairman Vong appeared extremely\nsurprised. Ah, this saying that he\nwalked out carefully reporting before\nleaving. I'll go out to make a phone\ncall to confirm. Seeing him leave, lie\nlap Van shouted impatiently, \"Hey,\" he\nturned to lie to Fuang with extreme\nfury. Fourth sister, what tricks are you\nplaying? At this moment, having\nsuccessfully turned the tables, lie to\nFuang was extremely smug, laughing\nheartily, and replied calmly, \"Don't\ntalk nonsense. Playing tricks is your\nspecialty, general director.\" Lie lie.\nLap Van gritted his teeth, so angry that\nhis face twisted hideously. \"You.\"\nSuddenly, Chairman Vong walked in\nbeaming with a bright smile, waving at\nhim. General director lie. The check is\nvalid. The bank has received it. So, so\nI'll be going first. Having the tables\nturned on him this time, Lilab Van was\nfurious to the extreme, he glared at his\nsister. Fourth sister, good tricks. Next\ntime you won't have such good luck.\nLet's go. Before he could leave, Tran\nMack walked in from outside with both\nhands in his pockets. Hey, go back and\ntell your family had a sentence. Don't\nforget the three-year agreement. Liap\nVan's face darkened. No need for 3\nyears. The Lie family will make you\nkneel and beg for mercy. Tranmack\nlaughed arrogantly. Who will kneel is\nyet to be seen. Lie lap. Van now panting\nwith rage turned to leave. Ho useless to\ntalk more. Lie defang now breathed a\nsigh of relief slumping onto the table.\nSigh. Finally overcame this crisis on\nnext to her saw her slump down and\npanicked. Chairman Tramac looked at the\ntwo of them smiled and said all right\nthis matter is considered over. Saying\nthat he waved his hand and a stream of\nspiritual power flew towards the\nchairman. Rest well, mom on witnessed\nthis scene and couldn't help but be\nastonished. Little Mac, you doing that\nis Tranmack Hurly reassured her. Don't\nworry, I use a little magic to let her\nhave a good sleep. In her sleep, Lida\nFuang was still talking in her sleep.\nMom really wants to sleep. Tranmack\nlooked at his mother sleeping soundly on\nthe desk, feeling very comforted. All\nthis time, mom has really worked too\nhard. Onin seeing him like that,\ncouldn't help but silently exclaim,\n\"Little Mac has really grown up. My hoa\nhas an air.\" Night fell. Tran Mack was\nfollowing Kuang Ha's son. The two walked\nin a large area. Along the way, there\nwas also a giant airplane part. Tran\nMack asked suspiciously, \"Where is this?\nWhat exactly is the mission you want me\nto perform?\" Kuang Haan then turned to\nlook at him, speaking seriously. you\nwill represent national interest to\nparticipate in a competition. Moreover,\nmaybe you can obtain what you want.\nSaying that, he spread his arms and\nshouted, \"This place is the battlefield\nof peace.\" Kuanha's son associated and\nexplained the concept of war of peace to\nTramac because it sounded very\ncontradictory. If it is war, how can\nthere be peace? The battlefield of peace\nis a special space filled with both\ndanger and opportunity, opening once\nevery 15 years. He continued, \"The great\npowers are qualified to select their\nseven most elite warriors to compete.\nThe loser must agree to the winner's\ndemands. This is the method used to\nresolve international disputes and\nmaintain world peace.\" Kuang Ha's son\nstood in front of Tramac, revealing top\nsecret information. Although it is top\nsecret, I can reveal a little bit to\nyou. Hasha has mortgaged Jaofong Island\nthis time. Saying this, he smiled and\ncontinued. In the battlefield of peace,\none does not rely solely on marshall\nforce. Intellect and diplomacy are also\nvery important. Furthermore, there's a\nranking for individual strength. Winning\nfirst place yields generous rewards. You\nwon't be at a disadvantage. After\nlistening to Kuang Ha's son, Tramax's\nexpression remained unchanged, and he\noffered only a single sentence of\nevaluation. You people really never\nchange your gambling nature. Just as he\nfinished speaking, Kovon Nai appeared\nfrom somewhere, interrupting their\nprivate space to report. Chief, the six\nmembers of the battle squad have all\narrived. Kuang Ha's son seized the\nopportunity, smiled at Kovon Nai, then\npointed at Tramac and said, \"Kovonai,\ntake this vice captain to get acquainted\nwith the other members.\" Kovonai\nimmediately smiled and agreed,\nunderstood, saying, \"So, he stepped\naside to invite Tramac in. Please come\nin.\" At this moment, among the people\nsitting in the room, one person saw\nTranmack follow Kovon Nai inside and\nstood up at surprise. Huh? Captain Tran?\nThat person was haong beside him. Trang\nChan saw Tranac's youthful appearance\nand teased with a look of disdain. No\nway. No way. Is this our vice captain?\nWhere did they find such a pretty boy?\nMeanwhile, Hahong had quickly stood at\nattention, saluting Tranmack in military\nfashion. Greetings, Captain Tran. Seeing\nTruang Chan's flippant attitude toward\nTranmack. Haha. Long turned to Truang\nChan with some anger. This is Captain TR\nof our Divine Eagle Special Ops team. He\nis your superior. You should respect\nhim. Truang Chan remained seated with\nhis arms crossed, sneering\nsarcastically. Look at his frail\nappearance. And you want me to respect\nhim? Keep dreaming. At this point, Lloyd\nChien, who was beside them, finally\nspoke up. Everyone is about to enter the\nbattlefield of peace together. We are\ncomrades in life and death. Stop\narguing. After Ly Chien finished\nspeaking, Lu Chu beside him also spoke\nwith contempt. That's exactly why we\nneed to be more careful. If this guy is\na hindrance, it doesn't matter if we\ndie, but the nation will suffer the\nloss. A girl nearby laughed loudly.\nHaha, I think he looks all right. That\ngirl was Fong mean. She looked around\nand continued. At least he's much easier\non the eyes than you, rough man. Sitting\nin his chair, Truang Ch lost all the\ncomposure he had just shown because of\nFong Mean's words. He retorted angrily.\nFong mean we risk our lives for the\nnational interest. Strength is what\nmatters. Saying that he turned to Kovon\nNai and asked, \"Captain Co, why didn't\nDuong Dentian come?\" Kov Nai who had\nbeen standing there witnessing\neverything furoughed his brows and\nshouted, \"Enough, Truang Chan, what is\nthe vocation of soldier?\" Hearing this,\nthe others immediately stopped their\nactions, saluted solemnly, and said in\nunison to obey orders. Suddenly, Fong\nMean chuckled softly and walked towards\nTranmack. He he leaned in close to him,\nblew a breath onto his face, and said,\n\"Little brother, were you scared? Don't\nbe afraid. Big sister will protect you.\"\nTran revealed a look of extreme disgust\nand warned her. If he used charm arts on\nme again, I will let you taste the\nflavor of spiritual backlash. Exposed on\nthe spot, Fong Mean was incredibly\nsurprised. She thought to herself. He\ncould actually detect my charm arts. To\nbe personally recommended by the\nleadership, he really isn't ordinary.\nAnother person nearby seeing Tran Mack\nexpose Fong Mean thought, \"Fong Mean's\ncharm arts can kill invisibly. Yet he\nsaw through them easily. It seems he\ntruly has some skill.\" Haha. Long\nwitnessed the whole process and said\nwith great satisfaction, \"Look down on\nCaptain Tran and watch out or you'll\nsuffer for it.\" Kovonai finally spoke\nup. All right, from now on, unite as one\nand face the outside together. Next, I\nwill explain the rules of the\nbattlefield of peace. He began\nexplaining the rules of the battlefield\nof peace to everyone. The battlefield of\npeace is only open for 3 days. We must\nhunt exotic beasts within the\nbattlefield and collect beast cores. In\nthe end, whoever obtains the most beast\ncores wins. After speaking, he didn't\nforget to emphasize a rule. Note that\ninside killing is permitted at will,\nsubject to no legal constraints. After\nco Vonai finished speaking, he held up a\nbracelet and continued. There's also\nthis counter. The counter will\nautomatically record the number of beast\ncores you obtain. If lost, resulting in\nan inability to submit them at the end,\nthe score is void. If destroyed, the\nperson will be immediately teleported\nout of the battlefield and disqualified.\nProtecting the counter is also an\nextremely important mission. Early\nmorning battlefield of Peace Island.\nThey walked on the island facing two\ngiant stone pillars on either side.\nSomeone couldn't help but exclaim, \"Wow,\nthis pillar is huge.\" Another person was\ncurious about who was on the pillar.\nKuang Haan turned around to answer them.\n\"This place is the activation formation\nfor the battlefield of peace.\" Hahong\nlooked confused, wondering if this\nformation was man-made or Kuan Ha son\nshook his head and replied, \"I'm afraid\nno one can answer that question.\"\nSuddenly a loud shout came from the\nother side. It turned out that people\nfrom other nations had arrived. The\nthree of them had dark skin, tall and\nmuscular bodies, looking very tough to\nprovoke. Look quickly. The people from\nthe kingdom of code have arrived. Saying\nthat the person pointed toward another\nnation. They were long robes and hoods\ncovering half their faces. Over there,\nthe people from the kingdom of Yang.\nThey even sent the red clothed\narchbishop of the church of light.\nBefore he finished speaking, the person\nlooked in another direction. People from\nthis nation were carrying a chest.\nLeading them were four people carrying a\nlarge chest. Were these people from the\nkingdom of man doing? Carrying a coffin\nhere. Behind them were others, each\ncarrying a small chest on their back.\nTranmack looked at them in\ncontemplation, thinking, \"There are no\nenergy fluctuations on their bodies, but\nthere is energy in the chests.\" Even I\nfind it hard to distinguish their\nstrength. It's peculiar. At that moment,\na person with bulging muscles appeared\non another side. His physique even more\nburly than the people from coat. He was\nbald, shirtless, wearing only a pair of\nshorts. The fighting nation has arrived,\ntoo. Tran Mack was startled the moment\nhe saw him. They actually have demon\nclan bloodlines, especially that\ncaptain. I'm afraid he has the giant\nbear bloodline. Once enhanced, his\nstrength will be extremely powerful. All\nthe nations participating in the\nbattlefield had arrived. They stood\nsurrounding a barrier circle. Someone\nloudly announced, \"The battlefield of\npeace is about to open.\" All nations\nwere present, ready to participate in\nthe battlefield of peace. They formed a\ncircle surrounded by four giant stone\npillars. For people standing on the four\nstone pillars shouted loudly, \"Open!\"\nEveryone levitated, and in an instant,\nthey were teleported from the initial\ngathering point to another location.\nEveryone stood before a dense, gloomy\nforest, all exclaiming in surprise,\n\"We've arrived.\" Kovonai had now put on\nhis full gear. With a slanted streak of\ngreen paint drawn across his eye, he\nspoke calmly. \"Listen to me everyone. To\nwin, we must establish a detailed\noperational plan, strive to collect more\nbeast cores, and at the same time\nprotect the beast cores encounters.\nAdditionally, we must do our utmost to\nensure the survival of all seven of us.\"\nKovon Nai stood before his 16 members\nand continued internationally. Relations\nbetween us and the fighting nation\naren't bad. We are both suppressed by\nthe other three nations, so we can ally\nfirst. Hearing this, Lloyin immediately\nspoke up. I agree with the captain's\nproposal. After he spoke, Trong Chan\nbeside him also chimed in, \"I also\nagree.\" Fongm expressed her agreement as\nwell, saying, \"Looking at the current\nsituation, there's no better idea.\" On\nthe side, Luchu asked Konai skeptically,\n\"What if the fighting nation refuses to\ncooperate or makes demands we absolutely\ncannot accept? After all, everyone wants\nto fight for first place.\" Kovon Nai was\nvery confident in his assessment at this\nmoment. Replying to Luchu, \"The fighting\nnation should have the same thoughts as\nus, so cooperation in the early stage\nshouldn't be a problem. We'll cross that\nbridge when we get there and adapt\naccordingly.\" Saying that, he turned to\nask Tranmax opinion. Vice Captain Tran,\nwhat do you think? Tranmax smiled and\nreplied, \"Ma'am, I have no objections.\nI'll just follow everyone.\" Trang Chan\nheard the conversation between the two\nand laugh disdainfully. Some vice\ncaptain. Suddenly, something seemed\nwrong. Everyone stood before a desolate\nruin, quietly observing. Suddenly, Fongm\nsaw movement underground and immediately\nshouted, \"Careful!\" right after a giant\ncentipede burrowed up from the ground.\nIt crawled toward everyone, emitting a\nterrifying sound as it moved. Gurr haha\nlong and everyone present except for\nTranmack immediately grabbed their\nweapons and assumed combat stances. He\nshouted, \"It's an exotic beast. Everyone\nprepare for battle.\" Tranmax stood to\nthe side, seeing that everyone had\nhigh-grade magical weapons in hand while\nhe was empty-handed and couldn't help\nbut think awkwardly. Everyone has\nhigh-grade magical weapons. Kuan Ha son\nmust have given them to them. What about\nme? Where's mine? Before he could figure\nout why Kuan Ha's son didn't give him a\nweapon, Trong Chan beside him turned and\nasked, \"Hey, where is your weapon? You\ndon't intend to fight the enemy\nbare-handed, do you?\" Tr replied calmly,\n\"I don't have a weapon.\" Hearing this,\nHaha Long felt a bit embarrassed. He\nturned to Tranmack and said, \"Captain\nTran, this destruction blade is the\nweapon of our Divine Eagle Special Ops\nteam.\" Initially, I didn't know you\nwould be coming. How about you use it?\nHearing Hahaong's offer, Tramac realized\nthe weapons weren't issued by Kuang\nHaan. He smiled and waved his hand,\nsaying, \"No need.\" Turns out they\nweren't issued by Kuang Ha's son. Then\nit's fine. Kovonai was extremely tense.\nHe opened his mouth and said, \"Everyone\ndo not let a guard down. The exotic\nbeasts here are very strong. We need to\ncoordinate our combat.\" Saying that, he\nordered, \"Lien, Lloyen, use your\nlightning guiding halbert to test the\nbeast strength.\" He turned to the others\nand continued his signing tasks. Trong\nChan Haha Long attack frontally. Luchu\nsupport and prepare a finishing blow.\nAfter speaking, he turned to Fong Mean\nagain. Fong Mean is in charge of backup.\nFongm immediately replied, \"Roger.\" As\nsoon as the words fell, everyone flew\nout, leaving Tranmax standing alone in a\ndaysaze. He looked at the scene before\nhim, unable to help feeling astonished.\nLy Chien holding the lightning halbird\nrushed straight toward the exotic beast.\nTrang Chan also charged forward. Oof.\nLloyen gritted his teeth and attacked\nthe exotic beast. Bastard die. That\nstrike of his not only failed to defeat\nthe exotic beast. Instead, it made it\neven more ferocious. It still emitted\nthat characteristic sound, but this time\nit also sprayed out a puddle of green\nliquid. Ugg. Kovoni stood aside,\nrealizing the situation was bad, and\nhurriedly shouted in panic. Quick,\neveryone, come to me. Konai raised his\nhand. A protective shield covered\neveryone, avoiding the exotic beast's\nvenom. After escaping the shield, Lloy\nChien charged forward again. \"Let's see\nyou spray me.\" That exotic beast, after\nbeing attacked by Ly Chien, became even\nmore ferocious. It cried out, \"UghG\nhiss! Ugg!\" The monster extended its\ngiant pincers, looking like crab claws.\nKovonai used an atrigramshaped shield to\nblock a pinch from the monster,\ninstinctively groaning. Seeing the\nsituation was bad, Fong Mean reminded\nits weakness might be its eyes attack\nits eyes. Hearing this, perhaps feeling\nit made sense, Kovon Nai's face turned\nserious, commanding Liian and Truang\nChan. Truang Chan obeyed the order. At\nthis moment, raging flames erupted from\nhis hands. He rushed towards that giant\nmonster without hesitation. The sound of\nTruang Chan's gauntlets pounding on the\nmonster's thick skin rang out. Although\nthe monster seemed fine, its skin was\nbeing scorched by Trong Chan's flames.\nNext, Liian below uses long spear to\nslash that monster apart. Ha. Looking at\nthe monster now reduced to just a stiff\nhollow shell, regardless of how strong\nit was before. Kovonai encouraged and\npraised the two good handled one first.\nAt this moment, Trang Chan was searching\nfor something inside the monster's\ncorpse. Then he said, \"I got the beast\ncore.\" However, this beast core should\nbe given to Captain Co. is the commander\nthe greatest credit. Saying so, he held\nan object the size of a marble in his\nhand. Turning his head to look at his\ncaptain and said, \"You can accept it,\nright, captain?\" The captain saw this\nbrat's goodwill. Kovai had to agree. All\nright, then I'll accept it. Suddenly,\nthe watch on Tramax's hand beeped twice.\nBeep beep on the watch screen at this\nmoment for lines of text appeared\nrepresenting the number of beast cores\nthey possessed. Tramax said, \"This\ncounter is really smart.\" At this\nmoment, the scene before their eyes was\nof rolling mountain ranges. On the\nmountains were ancient and enclosed\narchitectures. Everyone continued to\nmove forward. The seven of them reminded\neach other to be careful, avoiding\ndanger. Don't be subjective. There might\nbe some traps here. Then one of them\ncommented on this majestic architecture.\nNot bad. This citadel is not only 10\ntimes larger than Sia capital. It truly\nis the most majestic citadel. Luchi at\nthis moment had a scornful look. He\nmocked. This is nothing but a ruined\ncity. Trang Chan was provoked, excitedly\nswinging his fist, saying, \"What did you\nsay?\" Trang Chan at this moment had red\neyes like a ferocious beast that could\ntear Lu Chu apart at any time. He\nretorted. But you cannot deny it used to\nbe a majestic citadel not inferior to\nanywhere else. Luchu&lt;unk&gt;s eyes also\nbecame fiercer. He retorted that was\nbefore. Now it is just a ruined city.\nThen the two like fighting bulls buted\nheads. Truang Chan continued to refute\nbut its magnificence used to be number\none under heaven. Lu's gaze showed no\nweakness. He persisted with his view.\nNumber one ruined city under heaven.\nWhile the other two were still arguing,\nHaha Long realized something. On the\nfloor tiles, golden patterns could be\nseen. This place has a quiet atmosphere,\nsoothing heart. Then, seeming to\nunderstand something. Hahaong's eyes\nlooked into the distance. Nearby seems\nto be the ruins of temple. It was also\nthanks to this observation that he\ndiscovered something. Look, everyone\nover there seems to be a light. Everyone\nlooked in the direction of Haha Long's\nfinger, exclaiming in surprise. What?\nHow is that possible? This isn't\nscientific. Is that an oil lamp?\nNoticing everyone's curiosity, Tranmack\ncalmly explained, \"This lamp has an\nextremely weak trace of spiritual power,\nso it doesn't extinguish.\" Then, Haha\nLong revealed a curious look again. He\ndiscovered another thing. On the stone\nsteel, next to it seemed to be carved\nsome words. It turned out those words\nwere great thunder sound temple. Looking\nat the stone steel, Kovoni recognized\nit, saying, \"The temple in mythology,\nthe oil lamp that never goes out. It is\nsaid that under the great thunder sound,\ntemple suppresses powerful demons.\nEveryone said, \"Could it be that under\nhere?\" At this moment, a burst of sound\ncame from underground. Haha. Long\nquickly reminded everyone to be careful.\nFong Mean sensed something immediately\nspeaking out her feeling. At this\nmoment, a terrifying aura is coming from\nunderground, making my soul tremble.\nSeeing the situation was bad, Kovon Nai\nordered, \"Then let's retreat first.\"\nHowever, under everyone's feet seemed a\nbit strange. They panicked and asked\neach other what's wrong. At this moment,\nthe most worried and also the loudest\nperson was probably Lu. He asked loudly,\n\"Why can't I move anymore? My legs are\nlike they're nailed to the ground.\" Next\nwas Truan Chan. He looked both angry and\nterrified. \"Damn it, me too. My legs\nwon't listen to orders anymore.\" Unlike\nthe crowd panicking and losing composure\nat this moment, Tran Max still\nmaintained his calm, analyzing what was\nhappening to him. I also can't move.\nWhat exactly is underground? My\nunderstanding of Emperor Seedar is still\ntoo little. Wait, back then, why did\nMaster Immortal Emperor Chong Hua pass\nby this spiritport Emperor Seat Star?\nCould it be it wasn't a coincidence? As\nsoon as the words fell, a giant black\nhand reached up from underground.\nEveryone retreated in terror, looking at\neach other. What is this thing next?\nSomeone spoke up asking, \"Do you guys\nfeel your body is becoming very tired?\"\nTrang Chan seemed to realize something,\nshouting, \"It is sucking our life\nessence.\" At this moment, Tran Maxcom\neyes and expression gradually\ndisappeared. He seemed to have sensed\ndanger. \"This time's not good.\" Truang\nCh lost control and roared, \"What the\nhell is this thing?\" At the same time,\nthe oil lamp from before suddenly flew\nup. The lamp paused for a moment. Its\ntarget was that black hand. Seeing this,\nsomeone shouted, \"Quick, look at that\noil lamp.\" Immediately after, the oil\nlamp stopped, colliding with that\nferocious black hand, emitting rays of\ngolden light. After that scene, the oil\nlamp fell with a thud to the ground.\nThat hand also had no more movement.\nEveryone curiously asked what exactly\nwas going on. But they very quickly,\nhappily discovered they were no longer\nimmobile like before. Hey, I can move.\nTron Chan at this moment also happily\nsaid the feeling of being sucked away is\nalso gone. Next, Lloyd Chien discovered\nthe oil lamp had disappeared. Huh? Where\nis that lamp? Suddenly, something\nhappened to them again. Everyone turned\ngray. Then, everyone returned to normal.\nOn everyone's face was a confused\nexpression. Lloyd Chien asked in\nconfusion, \"Huh? Why am I in this pose?\"\nThe others also seem to have lost their\nmemories, asking blankly, \"What happened\njust now?\" Haha. Long raised his hands,\nagreeing with Lloyd Chien. I also feel\nlike I forgotten something. At this\nmoment, Tranmack rubbed his temples,\nthinking to himself. Sure enough, I also\nfeel like a segment of memory suddenly\ndisappeared. Only that oil lamp suddenly\nappeared in my sea of consciousness.\nNext, his eyes seemed to realize\nsomething unusual. Kovai at this moment\nhurriedly urged everyone, \"Hey, hey,\nwhat are you guys still standing there\ndays for? The Yan country has already\nobtained five beast cores. We must chase\nafter them quickly. Another person also\nagreed with Kov Nai saying, \"That's\nright. Why are we standing here? Really\nstrange.\" Truang Chan clenched his fist,\nsaying, \"They must seize the time.\" Then\nhe cheerfully said, \"Don't waste any\nmore time. Must quickly hunt exotic\nbeasts.\" Hearing Truong Chan say that,\nHahaong also agreed, \"Captain Tran,\nlet's go.\" Although knowing something\nwas a bit wrong, but Tranmack ultimately\ndidn't remember much more than them, he\njust gave MHM, but his tone was still\ncold. and mach. As soon as the words\nfell, a thousand thoughts still flash\nthrough his mind. I underestimated this\nspace too much. It still hides too many\nsecrets. Kovonai looked at the\nscoreboard saying, \"We are currently\nranked last. I suggest splitting up to\nact, speeding up the collection\nprogress.\" Saying so, he began to divide\nthe groups. Trang Chan and Lu Chu one\ngroup. Trang Chan's advantage is\ncomprehensive offense and defense, but\nthe drawback is his speed is quite slow,\nand Luchu uses the fastest speed to\ncompensate for his shortcomings. Next\nare those with balanced abilities,\nstable offense, and defense. Saying so,\nhe put himself and Haha Long in one\ngroup. Next are Tranmack, Fong Mean, and\nLy Chien. The three of them in one\ngroup. Their forte is being good at\nsensing danger, strong attack power, but\ndefense is quite weak. As for Tramac,\nKovonai said he belongs to the by two\nget one free type grouping. Done. In\nKovoni's hand right now was a jet black\nbead. He introduced this is a\npositioning stone. Can sense the\nopponent's position within 200 km.\nEveryone don't go beyond this range.\nTranmack reached out to take the\npositioning stone. Kov Nye continued.\nOnce encountering irresistible power,\nunable to hold on, retreat immediately.\nTranmack clenched the positioning stone\nin his hand, saying, \"I am a group by\nmyself.\" Hearing Tramac say that, Lloyd\nChien immediately disagreed. He said,\n\"Vice Captain Tran, you're not looking\ndown on us, are you?\" Hearing Lloyd\nChien say that, Fong added, \"Brother\nTramac, don't be reckless. You will\ndie.\" Hearing that, Hahaong also\nhurriedly added a few sentences. Captain\nTran, you go with Lloyd Chien's group.\nHearing that Tran Mack wanted to act\nalone. Truang Chan with a face full of\nprovocation said, \"Do you not want to\nlive anymore? Exotic beasts are not\nsomething you can use the back door,\nrelying on connections to deal with.\" At\nthis moment, everyone spoke up to\ndissuade Tramac. Kovai also called his\nname, intending to say something. Vice\nCaptain Tramac Kovon Nye continued,\n\"Just now not letting you go up was\nbecause considering it's your first time\nentering the battlefield of peace, need\nto observe and adapt first. You\nshouldn't let emotions take control.\nDespite everyone's painstaking advice,\nTran Mack was calm like that from\nbeginning to end.\" He still said, \"I\nwill not joke with my life. Everyone\nrest assured hearing him say that.\"\nKnowing Tranmack had made up his mind,\neveryone had to accept. So Kovo and Nye\ncommanded everyone to continue action.\nSince it said like that, then we split\ninto four groups going in four\ndirections. After splitting up to act,\nTranmac handled an exotic beast alone.\nTranmax stated his intention for acting\nalone. Take advantage while the counter\nhasn't sensed it yet. Hide the exotic\nbeast in the ring first. After hiding\nthe exotic beast, well, Tramac happily\nsaid, \"It seems this place is beyond the\nsensing range of the positioning stone.\nI can rest assured and scout. Suddenly,\na few bolts of electricity shot towards\nhim. Something had appeared. After\ncalmly seeing the situation clearly, it\nturned out the electricity came from two\npeople who looked a bit mysterious.\nTranmack voiced his disgust. H a cyborg\nand a wind elemental user. An\ninteresting combination. Immediately\nafter, a series of deafening explosions\ntore through the quiet atmosphere. Waves\nof killing intent roared and strayed to\nTramac. Dense ammunition rained down\nwhere he had just stood, but he dodged\nin time. His figure flickered in and\nout, dangerously evading every bullet,\nsprinting forward with full force. From\nabove, that elemental user, wrapped in\nwind, swooped down with the accomplice,\nforming a pinser attack. This scene was\nlike a symphony between science and\nsuperpowers. Tranmax stood amidst the\nthick dust and smoke, his gaze sinking.\nHe didn't say a word, but the chill\nradiating from his eyes made people\nshudder without being cold. Without\nhesitation, he rushed towards that robot\nperson. His coat fluttered behind him.\nOne hand clenched into a fist, aiming\nstraight for the target. With a loud\nbang, a fist like a hurricane hit the\nopponent's face, knocking her flying far\naway, rolling on the ground. The\nelemental user nearby stared with mouth\nagape, screaming a curse. Damn it. As\nthe fist lowered, Tranmack withdrew his\nhand, his sharp gaze sweeping over the\nenemy, just knocked away, frowning and\nmuttering. This armor actually didn't\nget broken by me. What material is this?\nBefore he could think much, she sprang\nup, hands pressing on the ground, blue\nlight flashing on her arms. She rushed\ntowards him, shouting, \"Die.\" Tramac\ntook half a step back, looking intently,\nand blurted out, \"It even has this\nfunction. If we could equip every Hasha\nsoldier with a set.\" The words were not\nyet finished when she rushed over\npreparing to attack him. But Tranmack\ndodged in time, swung his hand in a\nchopping motion, and her head fell off\nimmediately. Trram's voice was\nindifferent. Then the strength of our\nHasha military could be improved by a\nlarge margin. It wasn't until then that\nthe elemental user behind reacted in\nhorror, face turning pale at this scene.\nWhat the? Seeing that elemental user\nintending to turn and flee, Tranmack\nquickly used his ability to pierce\nthrough her body, coldly saying, \"And\nyou, too.\" Tranmack activated his ring\nto collect the two people inside,\nsmiling with interest. \"Just take this\nfirst, throw it to them to research\nlater.\" After researching, Tran looked\nat the two blue spirit stones in his\nhand, stunned. \"This is a spirit stone?\nWhy do they have spirit stones? Where\ndid they get them?\" The corners of\nTranmack's mouth lifted, chuckling\nsoftly, then putting them away. It seems\nafter leaving this battlefield, \"I have\nto go out for a stroll.\" While Tran Mack\nwas still immersed in thoughts about the\nspirit stones, a group of three\nstrangers appeared in the distance,\ndressed very oddly. One of them looked\nat the two we werewolves kneeling in\nfront, speaking in a provocative tone.\n\"Still want to continue resisting?\" The\ngray werewolf stubbornly replied, \"We\nwon't surrender even if we die.\"\nSuddenly hearing movement in the\ndistance, the blue werewolf turned his\nhead to glance. Seeing it was Tran Mack,\nhe shouted happily towards him. Hasha,\nfriend, we need you, friend. Where are\nyour teammates? Hearing someone call\nhim. Tramax stopped. Then he pointed at\nhimself. Right now, there's only me.\nHearing Tranax say he was alone, that\nwerewolf's pupils constricted slightly.\nThen he sighed looking at him. Sigh.\nThen you should go quickly. We don't\nwant to implicate you. Hearing this,\nTrax smiled, looking at him, and said,\n\"You have a good heart.\" Then he\nleisurely stepped up, blocking in front\nof them, his eyes directed towards the\nthree people. However, you guys bullying\nthe few with a mini isn't very nice.\nThat armored guy heard Tran Mack\nfinished speaking, immediately grabbed\nhis weapon, and rushed towards him, only\nto see Tranm calm and unhurried, using\nhis long legs to kick that guy flying\nwith one kick. The remaining two\naccompllices saw this scene, faces\nturning green with anger, almost cursing\naloud. As for that gray wolf, he looked\nup at Trram with a face full of worship,\nimmediately flattering. Amazing brother.\nAre you the most powerful person in\nHashia? Tranmack glanced at that guy,\nchuckling softly. You really are a clay\nbotus sutva crossing the river. Can't\neven take care of yourself. You want to\nfish for intel? Hearing this sentence,\nthe two we werewolves looked at each\nother, heads full of question marks. The\ngrey wolf turned to ask his companion\nClay Bodhisutva crossing the river. The\nbrown werewolf was equally confused. I\ndon't understand either. As for\nTranmack, seeing the armored guy was\nstill unwilling to give up and continue\nto rush over, he secretly calculated. In\nshort, for now, I need to hide my\nstrength in front of the Battle Nation\nwarriors. Just forcing them back is\nenough. Thinking it through, Tranmack\nopened his mouth slightly. Still want to\nfight? Just then he discovered the two\naccompllices who didn't look like normal\nhumans also joined the battle. Tramax\nsmiled speaking up. H want to confine\nme? Then he smiled and assumed a stance.\nGroup attack. Very good. Because I can\nsolve it all at once. Heavenly mystic\ndivine fist third form. Next was a\nseries of continuous loud explosions.\nThe two we wolves watched this scene.\nEyes almost popping out, mouths wide\nopen, speechless in the air. Only\nblurred after images remained.\nindistinguishable from one another, just\nflying back and forth. A few minutes\nlater, the figures of those three people\nappeared in a sorry state, fleeing in\npanic. Too scary. Run quickly. The grey\nwolf turned to Tranmack, eyes shrinking\nas small as beans, mouth agape, looking\nextremely stupid. It wasn't until\nTranmack turned to look at him that he\nsnapped out of it, opening his mouth to\nthank. Thank you, brother. Tranmack\nturned his head, facing the two, his\nvoice sounding gentle. No need to be\npolite. The goal has been achieved. I\nstill have to continue scouting.\nBattlefield of Peace. Day three. Today\nis as quiet as any other day. Tranmack\nheld an object in his hand, observing\nintently, then muttered softly,\nsearching by myself for two and a half\ndays with no result. What a pity. After\nthat, Tran Mack threw the object in his\nhand far away without reluctance. Put\nhis hands back in his pockets, mumbling\nwhile walking. Only a few hours left\nuntil the battlefield of peace closes.\nLet the counter sense a portion of the\nbeast's cores. Help Washa become first,\nthen go find them to regroup. A gentle\nbreeze blew past, the wind rustling,\ncool but urgent. After walking for a few\nminutes, Tranmax suddenly felt something\nwas wrong. The positioning stone sensed\nextremely intensely. The six of them are\ntogether. Could something have happened?\nIndeed, just as he predicted, on another\nside, they were in big trouble. Damn it.\nYou guys actually joined forces. Kovon\nNai frowned angrily at that group of\npeople, shouting, faux duk, you actually\nbetrayed us. The battle nation captain\nFoduk looked at them with a cold smile.\nTeam leader co, sorry. Right now, your\nis ranking first for national interest.\nI have to sell you out. Hearing him say\nthat the whole team gritted their teeth\nin anger. Truang Chan spoke up\nindignantly. I said, \"These people\ncouldn't be trusted, but we have always\nranked last. How could we suddenly rank\nfirst? Lloyd Chien behind also opened\nhis mouth. Look at the number after\nTramax's name. It's beyond imagination.\nDid he kill all the exotic beasts in the\nbattlefield? Beside them, the Battle\nNation team and three other teams were\ngathering to discuss tactics. What are\nyou guys saying? The D Nation wants to\ntake first place. The other three\ncountries don't agree. So, there's\ninternal strife. Now, they want to wait\nfor Tran Mack to return to interrogate\nhim on how he earns so many beast cores.\nThen Tranmack definitely must not return\nhere to regroup. Too late. Kovani looked\nat something saying in a deep voice, \"I\nsense Tranmack is approaching us\nquickly.\" Suddenly, a voice rang out.\nLook, who is that above? Tran Mack is\nhere. Captain Tran, run quickly. They're\nintentionally using us as bait for you.\nYou hurry and go hunt exotic beasts. All\nof Hashia's hopes are placed on you.\nContrary to the joy of the whole team,\nKovonai shouted anxiously to stop him.\nDon't come here. It's death. Tranmack,\nretreat immediately. This is an order.\nTranmack stood on the mountain peak\nlooking down, hearing that he fell\nsilent, his face showing a moment of\nhesitation. But in the blink of an eye,\nhe disappeared from his spot. The next\nsecond teleporting in front of everyone,\nsaying, \"No one will have to die, and\nneither will I.\" Trill\nthem all right away. I have to let them\nhave a chance to escape. This group of\npeople still has value to be exploited\nby me. Tranmack calmly used his ability,\ncalling out to the opposite side. Listen\nclearly. Finish speaking. He urged his\npower, swung his sword to slash the\nground, drawing a boundary line. Now I\nset a rule. Anyone who crosses this line\ndies. The teammate standing next to him\nheard Tranmax say that and\nsimultaneously broke out in cold sweat,\neach with their own thoughts. Is he\njoking? No. Must trust him. Why is he so\narrogant? Where does he get the courage?\nIt's over. A miserable failure. This\nvice captain is too arrogant. We will\nbecome sinners of Hasha. The opponents\nmock Tranmack. Brat, you're arrogant,\nbut showing off is useless. Attack. Hack\nhim to death. At the same time, one guy\nrushed toward Tramac, shouting, \"Go to\ndie.\" Tranmac's eyes were sharp and\ncold. Looking at them indifferently,\nemphasizing every word. I said, \"Those\nwho cross the line die.\" Looking at the\nfirst stupid qua DAC Nation person\nrushing up to throw away his life.\nTramac just quietly waved his hand once.\nThat guy immediately stiffened, eyes\nwide open, then collapsed, face hitting\nthe ground hard, just one step away from\nTramax's feet. Witnessing this scene,\npeople in the team were stunned. Sound\nof exclamation rang out everywhere.\nWhat? Killed in 1 second. What move is\nthat? That big guy died? How could he\ndie? I looked down on him, even provoked\nhim. Turns out the clown is me. Haha.\nLong reacted the fastest, immediately\nsmiling brightly, flattering. Captain\nTran is indeed super strong. Luchu\nstanding next to him heard that and put\nhis hands on his hips, face looking\nannoyed. Don't celebrate too early, even\nif Tran Mack killed one. Can he kill all\nthis group of people? Haha. Long\nhesitated, but Luchu pointed forward.\nLook, they sent out all elites of the\nteams. Seeing the opponent sending out\nall strong people, Kovon Nai shouted,\n\"Tranmac or you should run quickly as\nlong as you weren't caught by them.\"\nHasha still has hope of winning. Trang\nChan also chimed in to blame. Tranmack,\neven if you save me, I won't be grateful\nto you because you didn't put national\ninterests first. If you get stuck here,\nyou're a sinner. Tranmack heard this.\nTurned his head to glance sideways at\nTruong Chan, answering arrogantly. I,\nTranmack, act. Do we need you people\npointing fingers? The Cardinal\nArchbishop lost patience hearing them\nargue. Attack. Still looking elsewhere?\nThe Battle Nation people couldn't wait\neither, ordering the attack, roaring,\nattack immediately. Two Battle Nation\nsoldiers rushed up like the wind while\nthe Cardinal Archbishop created a giant\nball of light, then let go, throwing the\nspear at Tramac. The Barbarian Nation\nperson also quickly grabbed their\nweapon. Holy light cross slash single\nstrike charge. Then they all rushed\ntoward Tramac, seeing them rushing to\ntheir deaths. Tranmack also began to\nchannel his power. Still haven't learned\nthe lesson from last time, yet you dare\nto besiege me. Heavenly illusion, divine\nfist, third form. Then he waved his\nhand, shouting, \"Suppress the cosmos.\"\nIn an instant, a surging power struck\nforward. The battle nation minions took\nthe full brunt of the first blow. And\nimmediately after, those behind were\nalso blasted into the sky by that power.\nThis move of Tranmack was a punch that\nshook the world. Seeing his companions\npunched away by Tranmack, the second\nbattle nation person was immediately\nterrified. How is this possible? The\nbarbarian nation person saw this and\nturned purple with rage. Dare to kill my\nbeloved disciple. I must kill you. Let\nyou taste the power of this precious\nsword. He raised the sword, shouting,\nsword and the stone. The cardinal\narchbishop released his insects. Armored\nbeetles go. The battle nation and quad\nDAC people also rushed up together.\nfight him to the death. Seeing the\nleaders of the nations all attacking,\nTrax sneered, \"You guys have some skill.\nWeapons aren't bad either, but you are\nnot worthy of them.\" Then Tranax face\ndarkened, saying coldly, \"Go!\" A\nblinding light suddenly shot out,\npiercing through the cardinal\nArchbishop's beetle, then quickly\nskimming past the arrogant crowd in\nfront, making them pale with horror. \"My\ngun!\" Tranmax stood aside, watching\ntheir spectacular expressions, the\ncorner of his mouth slightly raised.\nSeems you can't even hold your weapons\nsteadily. Still want to continue\nfighting? How about it? That guy in the\nred robe behind seems to be hiding a\nhuge power. Want to try it out, too?\nFaux Duk clutched his bleeding chest.\nTurning to question the Cardinal\nArchbishop. You actually hid your true\nstrength, bastard. The Cardinal\nArchbishop, seeing his secret exposed,\ngritted his teeth and cursed. Damn it.\nThe barbarian nation person, seeing the\nsituation was bad, narrowed his eyes and\nsaid to the others, \"Enough. Fighting\nfurther is just a waste of time. There's\nstill some time before the competition\nends. We can still hunt many beast\ncores. Let's go.\" The cardinal\narchbishop heard this and breathed a\nsigh of relief. Herly agreeing, \"Let's\ngo too.\" Fod Duk glanced at him, turned\nto leave, cursing, \"O traitor.\" Haha.\nLong saw them all retreating and slowly\napproached Tramac. They finally\nwithdrew. But at this moment, Tramac\nfelt a wave of exhaustion. Not good. I\nconsumed too much energy. When he knelt\non one knee, Haha Long cried out in\npanic. Tranmack. A thought flash through\nTramax's mind. If that red rogue guy\nreally attacked, the situation would be\nmuch more troublesome. Luckily, they had\ninternal strife. Kovon and I also\nhurriedly ran over to care for him. Are\nyou okay? Are you injured? Tranmack\nreplied tiredly. I'm fine. Let's go\nsomewhere else to rest a bit. A moment\nlater, Tranmack sat under a tree,\nclosing his eyes to meditate and\nregulate his breathing. Tramac thought\nto himself, \"Sigh. Haven't recovered\neven a third, but it should be enough to\nuse.\" Seeing Tramac just about to stand\nup, \"Haha, long and Trang Chan\nimmediately crowded around asking, \"Are\nyou well? How's the recovery now? The\nnumber of beast cores of other countries\nhas increased again. What do we do? We\nmight very well be overtaken by them.\"\nHearing the rapid fire questions,\nTranmack patiently smiled and answered\neach one. I'm fine now. Don't worry\nabout the beast's cores. I'll handle it.\nEveryone's safety is most important.\nLet's meet at the exit. Really sorry to\ntrouble you. After giving instructions,\nTranmack turned and left, his figure\nquickly soaring into the sky, flying\nstraight towards the remaining four\nnations. Tranmack began to assess the\nsituation. Those four nations have\nstarted to show cracks. Splitting up to\nact is just convenient for me to strike.\nThey probably haven't gone far. Very\nquickly, Tranmack saw the first group,\nwhich was the Barbarian Nation. Tranmack\nquickly landed, whispering, detected the\nfirst group. Seeing a stranger\napproaching, the Barbarian Nation\nsoldiers immediately sounded the alarm.\nWarning, prepare for combat. Seeing\nTransmac walking over, the Barbarian\nNation people raised their guard in\nunison. What are you here for again?\nTranmax smiled benignely like a gray\nwolf luring Little Red Riding Hood,\nwalking closer and saying, \"Stop. I came\nto make a trade.\" The Barbarian Nation\npeople were stunned hearing this. Trade?\nTranmack nodded, his smile deepening. Do\nyou guys want beast cores? Saying that,\nTranmack took out a large amount of\nbeast cores, asking, \"Is this enough?\"\nTaking the bag of spirit stones from the\nother party, the barbarian nation person\nsaid with satisfaction, \"Good deal\nsuccessful.\" Holding a bag of spirit\nstones in his hand, Tranmack thought\nslly. This is the reason for not killing\nthem. Secretly using beast cores to\nexchange for the spirit stones in their\nhands. Seeing him smile so happily, the\nbarbarian nation people gathered and\nwhispered. He actually disregards his\nown country's interests. Truly scum. But\nthis is a big bargain for us. First\nplace is definitely ours this time.\nNext, Tranmack flew to the Quad DAC\nnation. Deal successful. Then the Eagle\nNation deal successful. Finally, the\nBattle Nation deal successful.\nCompleting all four trades. Tranmack\nhugged the bag of spirit stones,\ngrinning like a child. With so many\nspirit stones, I can upgrade to the\ngolden core realm faster. But at the\nsame time, in another place, Trax's\nteammates were gathering, discussing\nanxiously. The number of beast cores of\nthose four countries suddenly\nskyrocketed. I'm afraid we've fallen\nbehind. Tramax said to leave the beast\ncore matter to him. Seeing everyone\ndespondent, Trong Chan spoke up to\nencourage them. Don't give up until the\nvery last minute. Haha. Long also nodded\nin agreement. Trong Chan is right. We\ncan't rely on Tramac forever. Let's go\nhunt alien beasts quickly. Just then,\nthe wristwatch beeped. Fong Mean cheered\nhappily. Wait, everyone, look at this\nwatch. On the other side, Tramac also\nlooked up, smiling. All right, it's\ntime. Don't know if I've killed all the\nalien beasts in the battlefield or not.\nWonder if there are other battlefields\nof peace. Everyone gathered in a circle.\nTramax shouted, \"It's time.\" A beam of\nlight shot out from the stone pillar.\nThe patrol team was teleported back to\nthe forest. \"Back already?\" They looked\naround in panic. \"Quickly check if\nanyone is missing.\" Kuang Ha's son\ntearfully sighed in relief. \"Great, no\none is missing.\" Kovonai happily\nreported to Kuang Ha son, Elder Kuang.\nThe whole team returned safely. Kuang Ha\nson looked towards Tranmack standing in\nthe distance. That's good. Tramacu.\nTranmack stood calmly aside hearing them\ndiscuss him. Elder Kuang, it's also\nthanks to Tramac that Hashaka went first\nplace. Moreover, Tramac alone ranked\nfirst. Kuan Haan said happily. Good.\nVery good. Thursday Sin laughed. This is\nall Tranmax credit alone. We were just\nbackground decoration. Kuang Haon sighed\nwith some disappointment. Is that so?\nHes Tranmax smiled looking at Kuang\nHa&lt;unk&gt;s son, Elder Kuang. A black mage\nshouted. Too despicable. They pointed at\nTranmack questioning, \"He actually\ncheated us, hiding so many beast cores\nprivately. He deserves to die.\" An\nofficer holding a red box walked over\nsaying, \"Sincerely, congratulations\neveryone. You're the pride of this is\nthe reward for the individual first\nplace.\" Tramac opened the box in\nsurprise. \"Oh, what is this?\" Looking at\nthe black stone in the box, the officer\nexplained, \"This thing was taken down\nfrom the stone pillar of the magic\nformation. The owner can receive three\nchances to enter the battlefield of\npeace. He continued, \"In the battlefield\nof peace, there are not only alien\nbeasts, but also opportunities. When\nyour strength is strong enough, entering\ndeeper, you can use this object to\nexplore.\" Tramac wondered, \"Enter\ndeeper? Is there a special unlocking\nmethod?\" Tramac hesitated a bit,\nthinking, \"I was in there for 2 days and\nfound no clues.\" He replied, \"But it's\nover now.\" The officer continued,\n\"Right, this is classified. Wait until\nthe next time you come. We will talk\nmore thoroughly. Tranmack immediately\nturned to leave. Then I'm leaving. On\nthe plane back, Kuang Ha's son\nhesitantly started. Tramac Tran Mack\nunceremoniously exposed him. From the\nway you looked at me just now, I knew\nsomething was up. Speak straight.\nStuttering like that doesn't look like\nyou at all. Guana say Ice. I'm sorry.\nYou brought glory to the country in the\nbattlefield of peace. Yet I couldn't\nprotect your family. Well, I tramax shot\nup shouting in panic son. What did you\nsay\nmountain?\nThe trans family members were escorted\nup the high mountain. They blamed. It's\nall because of that brat Tramac harming\nus. Truly the bane of the TR family.\nSince when did he become Grandmaster TR\nand killed someone's grandson? They were\nsuspicious and hasn't been caught yet.\nTramac's father was very surprised. How\ndid Tran Mack become Grandmaster Tran?\nTo flongside Hayes? I don't know the\nspecific situation either. I only\nrecently guessed Little Mac's identity.\nOn the desolate mountaintop, the Hasha\ncrowd disgusted animatedly. When did Nam\nKung Vu come out of seclusion? Just a\nfew days ago, he immediately pursued the\nTran family upon coming out. Isn't this\nescorting the whole Trest\ntomb, forcing them to kneel and\napologize? He even wants to kill off the\nentire Tran lineage. Hasha's number one,\nGrandmaster Nam Kungvu. He said sternly,\n\"Tran Mack, killed my descendants,\ndestroyed my successors, ruined my\nNamkong family. Now he's hiding. You\nmust pay with your lives for him.\" He\nshouted at Tranqu Quac Luong, \"Kneel\ndown.\" Tranquac Luong also complied and\nknelt down. The Tran family members\nwhispered again. \"The pressure is too\ngreat.\" Heard he has reached the divine\nrealm. The TR family is probably dead\nfor sure today. The TR family head.\nTrax's grandfather, Tran Quac Luong. He\ncalmly raised his head to look at Nam\nKungvu. Nam Kungvu walked closer to him,\nsaying, \"You is the head of the Tran\nfamily, yet disciplined poorly,\ncondoning your grandson to do evil. I\nwill use your life first to sacrifice to\nthe souls of my dead descendants.\" A\nbooming voice came from above. Namuni,\nshocked, saying, \"What ghostly voice is\nthat?\" A helicopter was hovering above\nand a figure of Tran Mack jumped down.\nNam Kung Vu was suspicious. Someone\njumping from a helicopter. It can't be.\nTran Mac stood proudly opposite him.\nIt's Grandmaster Tran. I Tofuang\npanicked. Little Mac is here. Be\ncareful. This person is very strong. His\nfather exclaimed in surprise. You little\nbrat. Did you jump from the plane?\nGrandfather Tran was forced to kneel on\nthe ground. Nam Kungvu glared at him\nfuriously. The crowd shouted as expected\nof Grandmaster Tran, though it's just a\ntrick to deceive the public.\nHe certainly has no chance of winning.\nTranmack looked apologetically at his\nfamily. I'm sorry. I let everyone suffer\nbecause of me. Tranmack shifted his gaze\nto Nam Kung Vu. His tone I see, you dare\nto bully my family. Killing intent was\nevident in his eyes. I will definitely\nmake your soul scatter. A stream of\nspiritual power enveloped Nam Kung Vu.\nThe old man pointed at Tranmack, roaring\nin anger. Cut the crap. You dare to\nsever the bloodline of my Namkong\nfamily? Why can't I crush the bones of\nyour trans family to ashes? I went into\nseclusion for 30 years. Finally breaking\nthe shackles, becoming the first to\nreach the divine realm in a 100 years.\nToday I will let you taste the power of\nthe divine realm. The spiritual power\nturned into a giant hand. He ordered go.\nLitra's eyes widened. So strong. Is this\na dream or movie special effects? The\ngiant hand pressed down. The old man\nshouted, \"Tranmac, give up your life.\"\nEntering the divine realm, controlling\nheaven and earth. Nam Kungvu didn't use\nany martial arts technique, just a\ncasual strike. Tranmac gently tapped and\nimmediately neutralized it. Is this all\nthe skill you have? He broke the giant\nhand with a single move. Everyone's\nfaces turned pale, creating a stir. How\nis that possible? Nam Kungvu couldn't\neven block a single move. Tranmac looked\nat the old man and sneered. You have\nmerely touched the threshold of the\ndivine realm. Barely considered a\nhalfstep divine realm. Nam Kungvu\nretorted, \"But it is more than enough to\ndeal with you.\" A glint flashed in the\nold man's eyes as he launched an attack.\nTranmac gently dodged his attack.\nTranmac launched a counter kick. Nam\nKungvu quickly crouched down to dodge\nthis move. He didn't stop, continuing to\nswing his fist at him. Watching the two\nfighting in midair, the Tran family\nonlookers exclaimed, \"Namkung Vu is\nreally strong.\" The old man's eyes were\nsharp, every move clean and neat. They\nwondered, \"But Grandmaster Tran looks no\nolder than 20. How can he be so strong?\"\nSomeone explained, \"Because this world\nhas never lacked geniuses.\" Nam Kungvu\nwas not flying. He clased his hands\ntogether, gritting his teeth. Damn it.\nDon't be too arrogant. Huge spiritual\npower surrounded him.\nA powerful beam of light descended.\nScorching sunshine. The corners of Tran\nMac's mouth lifted. Spiritual power\nconverging around his body. Tranmack\nclenched his fist. Mystic heaven duel\ndivine palms. First form. Tranm glared,\ncondensing power, severing mountains. A\nseries of attacks rained down on the old\nman. Namkungvu was hit, falling to the\nground. H. Tranmack teleported, giving\nthe old man no chance to breathe,\ncontinuing to launch the next move.\nSecond form, overturning rivers.\nTranmack used all his strength, punching\nNam Kungvu hard. The old man cried out\nin pain. Tramac's powerful punch sent\nNam Kungvu flying. Tranmac raised his\nother fist and shouted again,\nsuppressing heaven and earth. Tramac\nrushed forward quickly, landing another\npunch on him. The bricks and stones is\nshattered under the force, flying\neverywhere. Dust filled the air,\ncovering all directions. A large pit\nappeared in the courtyard, but Nam Kung\nVu's figure was nowhere to be seen.\nTranmack frowned vigilantly. The Tran\nfamily gathered around, cheering loudly.\nOh my god, little Mac one. Little Mac\none. Our TR family is saved. Suddenly, a\nslight tremor frightened the birds in a\nflying away. From the cracks, streams of\ndark red smoke rose up. Everyone\npanicked. What's happening? An\nearthquake? The column of red smoke\ngradually rose, obscuring the view of\nthe onlookers.\nHe sneered, commanding heaven and earth,\nunity of heaven and man. This is the\ntrue divine realm. His body became\nrobust as if reborn. Thank you for\nhelping me break the shackles. This\nfeeling is truly wonderful. Nam Kungu\nlooked at Trax smuggly. I'm very happy\nright now, so I will give you a chance\nto leave your last words. Tramac flew in\nfront of him. I think you should say the\nlast words for yourself. The old man\nnimblely appeared behind Tramac. Tranmax\nseemed unaware, continuing, \"Otherwise,\nI will let you taste suffering.\" The old\nman threw a heavy punch directly at his\nback. Tramax's body fell heavily to the\nground. The old man blocked him again.\nAnother earthshattering punch landed on\nTran Mack. Seeing him fall from above,\nthe Tran family panicked. It's over.\nThis time, little Mac can't beat the old\nman. They shouted in unison, \"Come on,\nfight back!\" Nam Kungvu lifted his foot.\nHe smuggly stomped hard on his head.\nOuch! Martial artists below the divine\nrealm simply have no power to fight\nback. Seeing Tran Mack beaten down on\nthe tiles, they disgust. Grandmaster\nTran couldn't even block this move. When\nmartial arts cultivation reaches the\nlate stage, a slight difference is\nworlds apart. Next, spiritual power\ncondensed into two balls of light in the\nold man's hands. Nam Kung Vu was\ntriumphant. Now I will use the divine\nrealm to send you on your way. He\nreleased a blinding beam of light. Die,\nturn into ashes. Tranmac remained\nunharmed under the attack. He calmly\nsneered. A divine realm martial artist\nis indeed extraordinary. able to force\nme to use this move. Golden light\nflashed in his eyes. I'll use you to\ntest my sword then. Immediately, a sword\nwrapped in powerful spiritual energy\nappeared in front of him, radiating an\naura in all directions. Great down nine\nswords. The sword body grew larger,\nrushing straight at the old man. Nam\nKungvu looked at it in horror. The light\nobscured his vision. He screamed, \"How\ncould I?\" His body was burned to ashes\nby the light.\nAh! Ah. The people around cheered. One,\nwe won. Lidwang clenched her fists,\nsaying joyfully. We won. She stepped\nforward to hug her son tightly. Little\nMac. His father supported his\ngrandfather as they walked over.\nGrandfather asked in surprise. Little\nMac really won. Tranmack replied\nhappily. Grandpa, I'll let you suffer. I\nguarantee something like this won't\nhappen again. Grandfather looked at him\nwith joy. I believe you. You don't need\nto blame yourself. His father scolded\nunhappily. little Mac. Although it was\nindeed very risky. Fortunately, there\nwas no danger. However, after we return,\nyou must explain everything clearly to\neveryone. Tramax scratched his head,\nsmiling. Riley, Dad, I will definitely\nconfess honestly at the Lie family home\nin the capital. Old Lie held the phone,\ntalking non-stop, reaching the divine\nrealm before 20. We cannot give Tranmack\nany more time. If he has reached the\ndivine realm, then invite the\ngrandmasters of the martial arts world\nto come out of seclusion to deal with\nhim. Tramac was at the Tran family home\nin Good Duong. Tranquac Luong collapsed\non the bed, breathing with difficulty.\nTramac panicked. Doctor, my grandfather,\nTranquac Luong has latestage liver\ncancer. He groaned in pain. O. The\ndoctor turned around and sighed. Then\nI'll tell the truth. Tranmac's family\nfelt like they had been struck by\nlightning. Every word the doctor said\nwas like a knife cutting into their\nhearts. The treatment effect is not\noptimistic. I suggest letting him keep\nthe best mood and enjoy his final days.\nGrandfather struggled to speak. I\nalready knew. Don't be too sad. Birth,\nold age, sickness, and death are\nunavoidable. Tranmack frowned, thinking\nto himself. In a previous life, grandpa\ndid die of liver cancer, but that was a\nfew years later. Why is it happening so\nearly? My current cultivation is not\nenough to directly help him reconstruct\nhis body. Pills can't cure the root\ncause either. I must think of another\nway. Late at night, Tramac walked into\nhis grandfather's room and asked,\n\"Grandpa, why are you sitting up by\nyourself?\" Tranquac Luong opened his\nmouth to say, \"Little Mac, you came at\nthe right time. Come here. I have\nsomething to tell you.\" Tran waved his\nhands repeatedly. \"Grandpa, I know what\nyou want to say. Do you want to hand\nover the Tran family to me? I won't\naccept it.\" Tranmack held his\ngrandfather's hand tightly, saying\nfirmly, \"I want to cure your illness so\nyou can continue to be the head of the\nTran family.\" Tron\ngrandfather's hand. A stream of\nspiritual power enveloped the two. I\nwill transmit the mystic heaven\nascending dragon way to you so you can\nstep onto the path of immortality\ncultivation. One month later, Tranquac\nLuong had experienced life and death\nseveral times in his life. His state of\nmind was clear. So the cultivation\nprocess was also very smooth. In just\none short month, he was able to guide\nChi into his body and stabilize his\ncondition. He happily watered his\nvibrant garden. But a new threat was\nabout to descend upon Tran Mack and the\nTrans family. The figure of a woman\nstood on a cliff looking into the\ndistance. Two friends happily closed the\ndoor. Tranmack asked suspiciously, \"You\nguys came here to play? Why drag me\nalong?\" Thursday, Sin opened his mouth\nto say, \"Do you remember Ho Duongvu?\"\nTramac immediately replied, \"Of course,\nI remember our middle school classmate,\nbut she transferred schools after\nfinishing seventh grade.\" Tuha also\nadded, \"She has returned, saying she's\nabout to go abroad, returning to say\ngoodbye to old classmates. That's why we\ndragged you here together.\" The\nbeautiful Ho Duong Vu walked into the\nroom, waving to everyone. Hi, my loves.\nLong time no see. Ho Duong Vu was noble\nand fashionable, leaving a deep\nimpression. Tranmack asked suspiciously.\n\"Where have you been all these years?\nEven the teachers didn't know,\" she said\nhappily. I left in a hurry back then.\n\"Aren't I back to apologize to everyone\nnow?\" \"Ha!\" A girl ran in panic. \"Oh\nno!\" Man was dragged away by a hooligan.\nHo Duangu looked at her in confusion.\n\"What happened? Speak slowly.\" The girl\ngasped and recounted. Man and I went to\nthe restroom. When we came out, we\nbumped into some guys. Her face was\npale. Those guys touched Man Man. Man\nscolded them a few words and was dragged\naway by them. Poke Duong Vu walked with\nher, patting her back to comfort her.\nLet's go. Let's go see. Thursday, S\nclenches fists. We should go see, too.\nTranmack frowned and agreed. Of course,\nwe are all friends. We must help. Ho.\nDuong Vu walked to the door of a VIP\nroom. She asked, \"Is this the place?\"\nThe girl beside her nodded repeatedly.\nThis is the place man was dragged inside\nby them. Ho Duong Vu pushed the door\nopen. A green-haired man looked out the\ndoor in surprise. She walked in speaking\nsternly. People inside release man\nimmediately or we won't be polite. Man\npanicked and called out, \"Sister Ho,\neveryone.\" Lu Tuton's face darkened. He\nsaid provocatively, \"Want to come in and\nplay too?\" \"Oh, Duong Vu stood firm\nagainst him. Let my friend go.\" He\nsneered and touched his chin. She\nscolded me, making me unhappy. Wait\nuntil she coaxes me to be happy. I will\nnaturally let her go. Man, man\nimmediately retorted. That's because you\ntouched me. He raised his eyebrows,\nsmiling wickedly. Young Master Lu taking\na fancy to her is an affirmation that\nshe has a good figure. And calling the\npolice, I'm afraid you won't have your\nlives left to make a statement. The girl\nfollowing Ho Duong Vu retreated in\npanic. Trax stood aside, secretly\nsighing. This guy's killing intent is so\nexposed yet Ho Duong Vu isn't affected.\nTramac took a step forward, blocking in\nfront of her and speaking. A martial\nartist showing off in front of ordinary\npeople. Isn't that a bit bullying the\nweak? He looked at Tranmack in surprise.\nOh, you could tell I am a martial\nartist, but I don't sense any true chi\non you. Tranmack smiled smugly. That's\nbecause your strength is too poor. You\ncan't sense it. Lou Tuton sneered and\nstood up, full of killing intent. You\ndare look down on me? Tramac took the\nopportunity to provoke. Stop talking\nnonsense. Let's fight. If I win, you\nmust release the person. He confidently\ncracked his knuckles, smiling\ncontemptuously. Truly a newborn calf,\nnot afraid of tiger. So what if you\nlose? Tramax's eyes were firm. I won't\nlose.\nTramack pointed at him. Haha, fine. This\nplace is too cramped. Let's change to\nanother place. Lu Tuton confidently\nswung a fist at Tranmack. No need. One\nmove is enough to finish you. Tranmack\ncalmly blocked his move, speaking\nindifferently. Boring. He struck back\nwith a backhand, knocking the opponent\naway. He panicked unwillingly. How is\nthat possible? What is your name?\nTranmack closed his eyes, clapping his\nhands. A peak inner realm cultivator\nisn't worthy of knowing. Man burst into\ntears and rushed towards Ho Duong Vu.\nBoohoohoo. Thank you, Tramac. Thank you\neveryone for coming to save me. Tramac\nlooked at her in confusion. Huh? But I'm\nright here. Ho Duong Vu smiled and\nhugged Man. All right, it's okay. Now,\nlet's go back. She kept sobbing. Boohoo.\nHoohoo. Ho. Duong Vu comforted everyone.\nAll right. All right, everyone. Go home\nearly. Lu Tuton stood up from the\nground, his face gloomy, secretly\nholding a grudge. Bastard. Wait until I\nreturn to the clan. I'll send someone to\nsettle the score with you. Walking\noutside, Ho Duong Vu waved to the two.\nThat's it for today then. Wishing you\nsmooth sailing. Take care. When you want\nto talk, message me on WeChat chat. Ho\nDuong Vvu looked at Tran Mack somewhat\napologetically. Sorry, caused you\ntrouble today. Tranmack interrupted her.\nSpeaking, I have a question to ask you.\nAre you really Ho Duong Vu? Her eyes\nturned cold, looking at Tran Mack\nunhappily. Suddenly, she laughed. Ha,\nclassmate, your jokeelling level is very\naverage. However, still, thank you for\ncomforting me. The two looked at each\nother in silence. Tranmack turned to\nleave, waving at her. I believe we will\nmeet again. Oh, Duong Vu thought with\ncold eyes. Of course, we will meet\nagain. But by then, how will our\npositions change? The servant beside\npanicked and reminded, \"Young master,\nstop drinking. Let's go.\" But Lu Ton\ndidn't care. He still held the wine\nbottle, chugging it, shouting loudly,\n\"Don't worry about me. Today is\nextremely unlucky.\" A sound of footsteps\ncame from outside, making both of them\nstunned. Seeing the familiar figure at\nthe door, Luton frowned slightly,\nshouting, \"You, why did you come back?\"\nTramac looked at him with calm eyes.\nYoung master Louu, I want to borrow\nsomething from you. Lu Tuton stood up in\nannoyance. Borrow what? Before he could\nreact, Tramac rushed over, punching him\ndirectly. Tramax's voice was cold as\nfrost. Your life. Lu Tuton immediately\nscreamed in terror. The servant behind\nwas so scared his face lost all blood,\nshouting, \"Young Master Lou.\" Tramac\njust threw him a cold look, staring at\nhim. The servant screamed in panic,\nraising both hands and stuttering. Big\nbig brother, don't kill me. Trax's face\nbecame serious, speaking in a firm tone.\nDon't worry, I'm not interested in\nordinary people. Please pass a message\nto the Lou family. If they have the\nability, come find me for revenge. I am\nGrandmaster TR of Kien Ang. The scene\nshifted to a hillside. The moon was\nhigh. Tranmack knelt on one knee, bowing\nhis head. Pavilion master, the job is\ndone. The woman in front turned around\nrevealing a calculating smile. Although\nLu Tuton is a waste, no one dares to\ntouch him. Looks like there's a good\nshow to watch this time. The next day,\nthe phone rang suddenly. Tranmack\nimmediately picked up. Hello. Tran\nTongue Tu's face became panicked. He\ncouldn't help but exclaim, \"Master,\nsomething happened. People from the Lu\nfamily claiming to be from the ancient\nMarshall world came to my Hoa group\nlooking for someone, saying, you killed\ntheir only son, Lu Tuton.\" He paused for\na moment, glancing at lie to Fuang\nsitting behind, then continued. They\nwant to kill the chairman for revenge. I\ncan only temporarily hold them off.\nTranmack frowned slightly, somewhat\nsuspicious. The Lou family? The Lou\nTuton I met yesterday, but I didn't kill\nhim, nor did I say my name. Fine, I'm\ncoming over right away. After speaking,\nTranmack turned to the side, seeming to\nhave guessed something in his heart.\nThey could investigate my classmates to\nfind out my name. But yesterday, I\nreally didn't kill him. I'm afraid\nsomeone is playing tricks. A heavy\nfootstep stomped on the ground, shaking\nthe whole room. Lui, face full of anger,\npushed the door open and walked in\nsternly. He frowned slightly, shouting,\n\"Finish with your last words?\" Lie to\nFuang looked up, trembling, face pale,\ntrying to explain. \"Mr. Louu, I'm afraid\nthere is a misunderstanding.\" \"My son,\nLittle M,\" said he didn't kill your son.\nLulo didn't care. He stepped closer,\nroaring in anger. \"Don't talk nonsense.\nGrandmaster TR killed my son. I will\nkill everyone related to him. Tran\ntongue too stepped out firmly blocking\nin front of lia fuang eyes sharp as\nknives. I won't let you touch a finger\nof hers. Lu thoughi immediately rushed\nforward punching him straight in the\nbody. Tran tongue too shouted get lost.\nLafang looked panicked and terrified.\nShe screamed in fear. Tais tran are you\nokay? Tran tongue too tried to stay\ncalm. He frowned staring ahead. I'm\nfine. Luoi clenched his fist, his voice\nfull of mockery. A mantis trying to stop\na chariot. Fine, then I'll add another\nblow. Sending you on your way. Before he\ncould act, a figure rushed in from the\nwindow as fast as lightning. Tranmack\nappeared like a flash, the speed tearing\nthrough the wind, making Lu Tho exclaim\nin surprise. A look of joy appeared on\nLie to Fang's face. She looked ahead in\nsurprise. Little Mac, you're here. Tran\ntongue too sitting on the ground also\nwidened his eyes calling out loudly.\nMaster Lui stared at Tranmack a\nsuspicion rising in his heart. This brat\nis Grandmaster Tran. Tran Mack ignored\nhis words. He turned to lie to Fuang\nspeaking hurriedly. \"Mom, give this to\nTran tongue too to drink.\" She\nimmediately nodded. \"Okay.\" Then Tran\nMack tilted his head slightly to look at\nLuoi. Sparks of anger flashing in his\neyes, filled with rage, speaking coldly.\nAs for you people, finished speaking,\nTranmack raised his hand. A light\nimmediately burst out violently,\nenveloping him. The powerful aura\nsuffocated everyone. Dare to touch my\npeople. I want you to die. A voice full\nof surprise rang out. This is a flying\nsword. He is a sword immortal. Trax's\nvoice became icy. He stared at Lu Thoi,\nshouting, \"Go!\" Tramax stepped up,\ncovering Lie to Fuang's eyes,\nwhispering, \"Mom, don't look.\" The Luoi\ngroup twisted in pain, screams echoing\nthroughout the room. Hearing no more\nscreams from that group. Lie to Fuang\ncouldn't help but be curious. What\nexactly is going on? Tranmack hugged her\ntightly, whispering in a gentle tone.\n\"This matter is very suspicious, but\nrest assured, Mom, I will investigate it\nclearly.\" A moment later, Tranmack took\nLie to Fang back to her room. Tranmack\ninstructed solicitously. Mom, you rest\nfirst. Tran tongue too, and I will clean\nup the mess. Lafluang looked at him,\nworry still in her eyes. Then I'll go\nrest. You two be careful, too. Tranmax\nslowly put his hand into his pocket.\nTaking out spiritual stones. Tranmax\nvoice became serious. Tran tongue too.\nThese spiritual stones are enough for\nyou to refine 10 divine realm pills. Use\nthem to help martial artists unlock\ntheir physical strength. Just do as I\nsay. Tran tongue too reached out with\nboth hands to receive the two items then\nbowed slightly and replied yes disciple\nunderstands. The phone rang a panicked\nvoice came through. Did you meet people\nfrom the ancient martial world? Tranmack\nspoke calmly. Hello Kuan Ha son. Your\nnews is really fast. His face suddenly\nbecame tense. His voice also more\nserious. The ancient martial world acts\nwithout restraint extremely troublesome.\nI hope you can act decisively. suppress\nthem. Tranmack raises eyebrows slightly,\ntones serious. I can only say, \"If they\nprovoke me, I absolutely won't show\nmercy. If they don't actively cause\ntrouble, I won't touch them either.\"\nKuang Ha's son's voice became decisive,\nhe reminded. Also, the world's top\nassassin organization on the\nassassination list published by the\ndeath god. \"You are ranked first. You\nwill encounter a lot of trouble in the\nfuture. Be careful.\" Tranmack didn't\ncare at all. His eyes became cold,\nreplying calmly. Death god organization.\nBest not to provoke me. Finished\nspeaking. Tranmack immediately pressed\nthe button to hang up. Then he sat alone\non the chair and began to ponder. I must\nquickly improve my cultivation. Go\nabroad early to find spiritual stones.\nSuddenly, Tranmack stopped. A meaningful\nsmile appeared on his face. However,\nright now, I have to go pick up a guest.\nThe scene changed. The sound of slow\nfootsteps came through. Tranmack\nremained calm, hands in his pockets,\nspeaking loudly. \"Stop hiding. I\ndiscovered you long ago.\" A figure\nimmediately appeared behind Tran Mack,\nrevealing a sinister smile. \"Since I've\nbeen discovered by you, things are\nsimpler.\" Tran Mack turned slightly,\nspeaking softly. \"You are from the Death\nGod organization.\" Without waiting for\nan answer, Tran Mack generated a few\nbolts of lightning striking towards him,\nhis voice turning cold. \"Cut the\nnonsense. Go die.\" Tranmack closed his\neyes, paying no heed, uttering two\nwords, \"Boring.\" The person from the\ndeath god organization was somewhat\nsurprised, glancing suspiciously at\nTranmack. \"Neutralize my move in one go.\nThen taste this.\" Saying so, a pair of\nwings immediately grew from his back. A\npowerful light erupting. His gaze became\nferocious, laughing loudly. Tranmack\ncouldn't help but stare at him in\nsurprise. So, it's a light envoy of the\nlight race. I'm becoming more and more\ninterested in this planet's history. The\nman's face became even more twisted. He\nraised his hands to the sky, creating\ntwo spheres of light in midair,\nmuttering incessantly, \"God said, let\nthere be light.\" Then the person from\nthat organization fired the two spheres\nof light straight at Tranmack, his voice\nbecoming excited, almost crazed, and\nthere was light. Tranmack stood there\ncalmly, casually mocking, \"Looks very\nstrong. Pity, it's just an ordinary\nmove.\" Saying so, Tranmack decisively\nextended his hand forward. A sharp beam\nof light immediately shot out from his\npalm. The other person looked at the\nbeam of light closing in before his\neyes, staring in horror and screaming,\n\"What?\" The person from that\norganization immediately put up two\nfingers, muttering, \"Block!\" A wave of\npowerful energy radiated from between\nhis fingers, trying to stop the incoming\nsword of light. Trax suddenly revealed\nan unexpected smile, saying in surprise,\n\"Not bad. Actually blocked my heaven\nslash.\" The other person's face\nimmediately darkened. He frowned, unable\nto hide his annoyance. \"You are very\nstrong, worthy of being top of the\nlist.\" He immediately clasped his hands\ntogether, expression serious, as if\npreparing a powerful attack. His voice\nwas full of confidence and majesty, but\nI still haven't used my full power.\nDivine light shines upon the earth,\nburning away all evil. Saying so, his\neyes turned completely white, a beam of\nlight immediately shooting out from his\neye sockets. He looked up to the sky and\nroared, the sound like thunder, divine\npunishment descends. Tranmack\nimmediately flew up, jumped, his voice\nechoing in midair, full of disdain,\nboasting shamelessly. You are also\nworthy of calling yourself God. The\nperson from the organization\ninvoluntarily took a step back.\nTranmax's eyes suddenly lit up. He\nslightly raised his hand, preparing a\nmove. In the blink of an eye, a giant\nsphere of light appeared in his hand.\nTramac calmly said, \"One move to finish\nyou.\" Saying so, Tranmack decisively\nthrew the burning energy sphere down.\nThe sphere of light fell like a meteor\ncarrying terrifying spiritual power\ntearing through the air, rushing\nstraight at the person from that\norganization. He roared tensely, raising\nhis hands, desperately resisting the\npower flooding into his body. Trax's\nvoice rang out gently, \"Stop bragging.\"\nThen he clenched his fist, lightning\ngradually appearing around Tranmax's\nfist. Without hesitation, Tramac punched\nthe dazzling fist straight at the person\nfrom the organization. The light tore\nthrough space, rushing away at a speed\ninvisible to the naked eye. The other\nperson had just reacted when he was\nswallowed by the light. His body began\nto dissolve in the intense light. His\ntwisted face letting out a final scream.\nThe smoke and dust gradually cleared,\nleaving no trace of the annihilated\nperson. Tranmack became solemn, his eyes\nfull of killing intent. Death god\norganization. I have received your\ngreeting. In the future, I will\ndefinitely return the favor. Suddenly, a\nphone ringtone rang out. Transmac\nimmediately took out his phone, looking\nat the text displayed on the screen.\nTransmac, please save me. The scene\nshifted to the secret laboratory of the\ntongue dying group. The researcher\nlooked at the man in front of him,\nunable to help, feeling discouraged.\nThis guy fainted again. Can't continue\nanymore. A voice full of majesty rang\nout. It's been a day and a night. Have\nyou asked it out yet? One person looked\nover, stammering, \"Young, young master,\nsorry.\" Kung Nam Dvau raised his\neyebrows and shouted, \"A bunch of\nuseless trash. So slow, I can't wait any\nlonger.\" The group of people in white\ncoats immediately bowed their heads, not\ndaring to look straight at Avo. One of\nthem said tremblingly, \"Young Master\nKung Nam, we don't know if he really\ndoesn't know anything or if he's\ntight-lipped.\" The person next to him\nalso hurriedly chimed in. We use\nhypnosis drugs. Even the heaviest dose\ncouldn't get it out. There is no news\nabout the longevity medicine. Kung Nam\nDavo's face suddenly sank, roaring\nangrily. If hypnosis doesn't work, then\nuse violence. I don't believe he can\nendure it. The researcher beside him\nhesitated a bit, then nodded repeatedly,\nvoice trembling. Yes. Yes, sir. Lee Kin\nThuang's face became gloomy, eyes full\nof confusion and fear. He looked at the\ngroup of people in white coats\napproaching, screaming in despair. Don't\ncome here. What do you want to do? Kung\nNambda Vo took a step forward, eyes\nrevealing determination. He spoke in an\noppressive tone. Old man, I'm serious.\nWe Dong Lamb people really need the\nlongevity medicine to treat those\ninfected by nuclear radiation. Tell me\nquickly. Lee Kin Fuang lowered his head\nslightly, gritting his teeth. Speaking\nin a firm tone, \"Anyone who comes into\ncontact with a longevity medicine only\nhas hasha rights. I don't even know\nwhere the production site is. I really\ndon't know the formula.\" Kung nom Devo\nbegan to get angry. He roared. Still not\ntalking. I want to see if your mouth is\nhard or your bones are hard. Do it. A\nman in white immediately grabbed him.\nLee Kin Fuang looked at Dvau struggling\nand shouting. Don't come here. Lee knew\nHoa ran in from outside. Voice panicked.\nFather Kung Nam de Vo glared over face\nfull of anger shouting. Lee Kin\nFuang&lt;unk&gt;s daughter daring to barge in\nhere. Then don't expect to leave. Get\nthem. The bodyguards hadn't had time to\nact when Tranmack rushed up punching\nstraight at one of them. Leit knew Hoa\nturned her head in surprise, looking at\nhim blankly. They swarmed up, attacking\nwithout mercy. But Tranmack only tilted\nhis body slightly, raising his hand to\ngently brush them aside. For the final\nblow, he raised his leg and kicked\nstraight at the masked man's chest,\nkicking him flying backward, fainting on\nthe spot. Kung Nam Dvau ground his teeth\nin anger, eyes full of shock and\nindignation. He glared at Tranmack,\nspeaking in a suspicious and incredulous\ntone. You could actually easily break my\nclan's warrior stealth technique. You\nare a grandmaster. After a moment of\nsilence, Davo shouted, turning to a\nfigure behind him. Lord Lu Sin, please\ntake action. Tramac calmly looked at the\nblack smoke in front of him, speaking\ncoldly. Come out. In my eyes, your\nstealth technique is nothing but a petty\ntrick. Loosen appeared, clasping his\nhands, eyes full of interest. Then he\nlaughed loudly. You just, he bowed\nslightly, his tone humble, but hiding\nmurderous intent. Your excellency\nactually saw through my ninjutsu. I\nwonder what flaw I have. I hope your\nexcellency can enlighten me. Tranmack\nremained motionless, casually putting\nhis hands in his pockets, looking\nstraight at Lin, speaking calmly. \"Put\nthat act away.\" Tranmac's face became\nsolemn, staring at the opponent with\ncold eyes. Polite but fake. Truly\nnauseating. Then Tran Mack hesitated no\nlonger, his eyes icy, emotionless,\nrushing forward like lightning, paying\nno heed to everything around. Out of\nsight, out of mind. I'll just kill you\nto be done with it. Lucen reached out to\ngrasp the sword hilt on his back. He\ngrowled softly, \"Go!\" Saying so, he\nimmediately drew his sword and raised it\nhigh. A sky-high killing intent erupted.\nAt that moment, Tranmack rushed over\nlike lightning, chopping straight down\nwith one sword. Tran's hand was now as\nhard as rock. The sword in Lu Sin's hand\nshattered into pieces in an instant,\nmaking him unable to believe it.\nTranmack withdrew his hand, looking at\nthe green smoke rising from his hand,\nmocking. Is this all the skill you have?\nTrash.\nShouting Mr. Leing, how can it be? You\nare not a grandmaster. You are even\nstronger than a grandmaster. His eyes\nwere full of doubt. Could it be? You are\nMaster Tran and Kining. Tranmack just\nturned around seeing Kung Nam. Duh. Vone\nkneeling on the ground, face drained of\nblood, but still trying to keep calm.\nMaster Tran, I am a Dong Lamb clansman.\nIf you kill me, it will spark a dispute\nbetween the two countries. As long as\nyou spare me, I will absolutely never\nstep foot into Hashia again. He bowed\nhis head, whispering urgently, \"Besides,\nI can also,\" without waiting for Kung\nNam Dvau to finish his sentence. Tramac\nangrily cut him off. \"You Dong Lamb\npeople are truly inscrupulous.\" He\nglared at the group of people behind.\nWhy haven't you released the people yet?\nThat person immediately bowed, not\ndaring to delay, \"Yes, we listen to you\nin everything.\" Beside him, a person in\nwhite panicked and cried out, \"The young\nmaster is dead.\" The rope binding Lee\nKinfuang was immediately untied. Lee\nknew Hoa quickly ran over to support Lee\nKinfuang. At this time, his face was\npale, breath weak, but his eyes were\nstill determined. He forced himself to\nstand straight, speaking loudly. I am\nLee Kin Thuang. Thank you for master\ntrans life saving grace. Hearing the\nvoice behind him, Tranmack immediately\nturned around saying nothing. He was\nsilent for a moment, then spoke\nseriously. No need to thank me. The\nperson I helped is elite new Hoa. She\nsaid with some embarrassment, \"I'm so\nsorry. Because of helping me, you even\nkilled the young master of the Kung Nam\nfamily. They definitely won't let this\nrest.\" Tramac raised his eyebrows\nslightly, eyes solemn, tone decisive.\nThey dared to touch the longevity\nmedicine. Even if it wasn't to help you,\nI would still have acted. Tramac was\nsilent for a bit, then continued. As for\nrevenge, I have never been afraid.\nHowever many come, I kill that many.\nTramax's eyes became extremely\ndetermined, speaking seriously. Kill\nuntil they don't dare to come anymore.\nOne month later, a plane took off,\nsoaring into the blue clouds. A phone\nringtone rang out. Tranmac immediately\nanswered, \"Hello, who is it?\" The other\nend of the line transmitted a panicked\nvoice. Master Tran New Hoa has been\nkidnapped by the Kong Nam family. I beg\nyou to say my daughter. Hearing these\nwords, his face darkened, speaking\ncoldly. Is that so? I know. As soon as\nthe phone hung up, Tranmack clenched his\nfist, anger flashing in his eyes, he\ngritted his teeth, articulating each low\nword. These rats don't know life from\ndeath. Wait until the day I cultivate to\nnaent soul. I will definitely make that\nisland completely disappear. The plane\nflew into the high sky. The Kung Nam\nfamily is the number one family in Dong\nLamb, capable of even influencing the\nimperial family. Every generation of\nKong Nam family heads must marry an\nimperial princess to balance the\nbenefits of both sides. The scene\nshifted to the foot of Kong Tang\nMountain at the main residence of the\nKong Nam family. Lucen not Dao was\nsitting opposite chatting with Kong Nam\nKai. Both of their faces looking\nextremely tense. Loose and not Dao\nslightly closed his eyes, seeming to\ncalculate something in his mind. Beside\nhim, Kung Nam Kai spoke up immediately,\nhis tone full of anxiety. Mr. Lucen, he\nkilled your disciple. Will you really\nnot agree to help us? He kept his eyes\nclosed calmly saying, \"As the successor\nof the Lucen, not Dao sect. My duty is\nto bring glory to the sect, not to be a\nwararmonger. I warned my disciple long\nago not to get involved in worldly\naffairs. He didn't listen. His death is\nhis fate. The Kung Nam family head\nstared wideeyed, extremely confused. Is\nMr. Lucen afraid of that master trant?\nLucen, not Dao, suddenly stood up,\nturned to leave, and said coldly, \"I am\nuseless, too. Unless enemy nations\ninvade, I will not take action.\" A\nservant immediately stepped forward,\nwhispering into a Kung N Kai's ear.\nMaster, if Lucen not Dao doesn't help,\ncan't we win? He raised his head, his\ntone firm. Don't worry, the Dong Lamb\nmartial arts world doesn't just have\nLucen, not Dao. This time, I must get\nthe longevity medicine. The scene shifts\noutside the main gate. Tran Mack walked\nin slowly, surprised to find the door\nopen. It seems you're fully prepared to\nwelcome me. A cold voice came from\ninside, full of provocation. Mr. Tran,\nthe person you are looking for is in a\nmanner. If you have the ability, come\nin. Transm gently put his hands in his\npockets. Looked up and replied calmly.\nThen I won't be polite. And you? You\nwon't have a chance to regret it either.\nA doubtful voice rang out. Can a 100\nninjas stop him? As soon as the words\nfell, a crowd rushed forward,\nsurrounding Tran Mack tightly. You\nalready have the answer in your heart,\nsir. Why ask me? Tranmack remained calm,\nslowly walking towards the crowd, his\ngaze becoming extremely determined,\nlooking straight ahead. If he were just\na person with an undeserved reputation\nin just a blink of an eye, Tranmax swept\naway the crowd without wasting any\neffort. Then my son and Lou sin's\ndisciple wouldn't have died. Just\nstepping into the inner courtyard, two\nmasked men were already waiting there.\nTramac couldn't help but frown.\nSurprised half-step divine realm\nexperts.\nAli. He spoke in a calm tone. Neither\nfast nor slow. Do you feel these two\ncould stop Master Tran? Akisa Okamoto\nsitting opposite was a bit worried. He\nhesitated and shook his head, not\ncertain. Okamoto tried to stay calm,\nclosing his eyes and saying, \"Watch\nquietly.\" Outside the door, two ninjas\nrushed straight at Tranmack without\nhesitation. He glanced at them,\nrevealing a meaningful smile. The blade\nis the most ordinary type, but the sword\ntechnique combines with nature.\nInteresting. Having said that, he took\nout his sword, his tone becoming\nserious. However, it is all useless.\nHeaven slashing sword. Tranmack quickly\ndefeated them with just a few moves.\nFinally, he shouted loudly, the sound\nechoing through the manner. Okamoto\nbowed his head slightly, his voice\nlowering. They failed. What a pity.\nHearing this, Kung Na Min Kai stood up\nabruptly, ordering sternly. Aiza\nOkamoto, I have nurtured you for so many\nyears. It's time for you to repay me. He\nimmediately clasped his hands\nrespectfully. Of course, Tranmack had\njust dealt with the two men, turned his\nhead slightly, somewhat surprised.\nAnother divine realm expert. Akeisa\nOkamoto instantly appeared behind\nTranmack, shouting arrogantly, \"Cut the\nnonsense. Only one of us will survive.\"\nAnd he raised his long sword high,\nshouting, \"Void slash!\" A beam of light\nimmediately emitted from the sword in\nhis hand, seeming to want to tear apart\nthe space. On this side, Tranmack\nremained composed, his eyes cold. He\nchanted softly, his tone determined,\n\"Heaven, mystery, divine fist, third\nform.\" The words were not finished. He\npointed straight at Akeisa Okamoto,\nshouting, shaking the universe. He\nimmediately blocked with his sword\nhorizontally, stopping the opponent's\nattack. Then Okamoto's body trembled\nslightly. He raised his hand high,\nlooking mockingly at Tramac. Is this all\nyou've got? Take my chaotic wind move.\nTramac remained calm, condensing a black\nenergy ball in his hand. He turned his\nhead, staring sharply at the opponent.\nTwo forces began to confront each other.\nThe surrounding space seemed compressed.\nEvery passing second becoming more\ntense. Without hesitation, Akisa Okamoto\nleaped high, holding the glowing long\nsword, shouting, \"Go to die! Harmonic\nslash.\" Tranmack was slightly stunned\nbut immediately retaliated, \"You are one\nwith the sword, so I won't hold back\neither.\" He gently raised the sword in\nhis hand, shouting majestically, \"Great\ndown nine swords.\" In an instant,\nTranmax's sword emitted a huge flame in\nmidair. Then he raised his hand, eyes\nserious, chanting heaven rending form.\nAt this moment, the fire in the sword\nburned fiercely, shooting powerful\nsparks toward Akisa Okamoto, swallowing\nhim, making him unable to resist\nanymore. A few seconds later, Okamoto\nhad completely disappeared. Tranmack\ndidn't stop. He continued straight\ninside, asking him patiently and coldly,\n\"I'll give you a chance.\" Where his\nelite knew Hoa. At this time, there was\nno one in the room, only two half-finish\ncups of tea on the table. Tranmack was\nexpressionless, opening his mouth\ncoldly, his voice low and sharp like a\nknife. Ran away. But where can the\nperson I want to kill run to? In the\nmorning on the slope of Kong Tang\nMountain, Tranmax stood on the bridge,\nobserving. This slope has the aura of\nLeu Hoa. It seems this place hides a\nmystery. Suddenly, Tranmax saw a door,\nfound it. Indeed, there's an entrance.\nHe pushed the door and walked in. Tramac\nlooked around and saw Leit New Hoa tied\nto a chair. Her mouth gagged, making\nmuffled sounds. Tramac stepped forward\nto untie the gag. She screamed, \"Tramac,\nrun! There's a trap here.\" Around the\ninside, many gun barrels were pointing\nstraight at Leite New Hoa. Tramac\nrealized there was a problem here.\nQuickly rushed over to shield Leu Hoa\nwith his body. He turned to look at her.\n\"It's good you're okay. These little\nmechanisms can't trouble me. Let's get\nready to go out.\" She looked at Tramac\nin surprise, stammering, \"Huh? How do\nyou plan to get out?\" Boom. Brusio.\nTramac hugged her and rushed out. Lua\nscream in fear. Ah, help Tranmack. With\nme here, you won't be in danger anymore.\nLehoa nestled in a Transmax's chest in\nfear, sobbing. Boohoo. Tramac, I thought\nI was dead for sure. I thought you were\ndead, too. I Tramac comforted her. Cry.\nIf you're scared, just cry it out. At\nthe international airport, she looked at\nTramac. Sorry. Just now. I I couldn't\ncontrol my emotions. She stammered. I\nwas really scared. Still thinking about\nwhat happened just now, Tran Mack patted\nher shoulder to comfort her. It's all\nover now. I'll take you home. He\nfrowned. Later, I will go to the Kung\nNom clan to settle the score. Two men in\nblack walked over. You're Master TR,\nright? Luca Zahes and Invitin. Tramac\nlooked at the two men in black. Who are\nyou? I don't know him, and I don't have\ntime right now. The man in black\nthreatened, \"If Master TR doesn't go,\nyou two won't be able to buy any flight\ntickets.\" The man in black said again,\n\"Perhaps you can act as you please, sir,\nbut what about your friend?\" Fear and\nworry appeared on her face. Tramac\nTramac sighed. Sigh. Lead the way. They\ntook the two to a villa. This is the\nplace. He gestured to invite Master\nLusin is inside. He went in to report\nMaster Lin. Master Tran has arrived. He\nwalked out. Master Tran, please to meet\nyou. Tranmack still didn't understand\nwhat was happening. He kept a straight\nface. I want to experience Master Trans\nHasha ultimate skills. Tranmack frowned.\nExcuse me for being blunt. I'm not\ninterested. Tranmack sat down and\nquestioned. You know who I am. Yet you\ndare to threaten me. What does Lucen not\nDao want with me? He said sternly. If I\nsay I want to demand justice for the\nKung Nam family. What then? Tramac asked\nin surprise. What do you mean? He took\nout a phone. This is the evidence.\nTranmack recalled that day. When he\narrived, they had already fallen on the\nground. He said, \"Perhaps Kung Nam Kai\nhad some personal grudge against you,\nbut you slaughtering the entire Kung Nam\nfamily is too cruel. My Don Lamb martial\narts world cannot sit idly by.\" Tramac\nfrowned, his eyes thoughtful. \"It's the\nsame trick as last time. Impersonating\nhim to kill people again, creating\nenmity for him.\" Tramac replied calmly.\n\"I say I didn't do it. Do you believe\nme?\" He said, \"The evidence is clear. Do\nyou still want to deny it? This isn't\nMaster TR style of conduct, is it?\"\nTranmack smirked. Forget it. Then set a\ntime. Leit knew Hoa stood behind him.\nTranmack. If you didn't do it, it's\nfine. Dong Lamb wants an explanation.\nI'll give it to them. He looked at\nTranmack. Good. Then 3 days later, a\ndecisive battle at Mount Fuji. Let's\ndecide on that. People discussed\nexcitedly. Lucen, not Dao, is about to\nmake a move. Quick. Book flight tickets\nand hotels. A once in a millennium\nevent. Must go watch Mount Fuji. 3 days\nlater, they saw him standing on the\nmountain holding a sword. Look quickly.\nMaster Lu Sin has appeared. They pointed\nto the other side. Is that Master Tran?\nSo young. Master Lou Sin will surely\nwin. On the mountain peak, the two stood\nfacing each other. Before the battle\nbegan, he silently drew his sword. I\nhope you won't disappoint me. Tranmack\nsmiled. Please instruct me. He drew his\nblade. The blade body covered in red\nlight, killing intent overflowing.\nTranmack frowned slightly. The evil\nenergy is too strong. It turns out to be\na demonic blade stained with the blood\nof countless Hasha people and you have\nalso been swallowed by the evil energy\nbecoming a pitiful puppet slave of the\ndemonic sword. He raised the blade\nshouting you are not worthy to judge my\nway. He ordered evil demon let me handle\nit. Tranmack looked at that blade\nfrowning slightly. Has the evil nature\ngrown to this extent? This blade should\nnot exist in the world. He jumped up\ndecisively slashing down. Cut the crap.\nThe evil power on the blade is too\nstrong. Tramac, you still dare to come?\nHis blade chopped down. The earth veins\ncracked. Rocks on both sides were torn\napart, flying everywhere. Lucin frowned\nin boredom. If you only have this much\nstrength, then today ends here. He stuck\nthe blade into the ground, gathering\nmomentum and waiting, lurking for an\nopportunity. After he finished\npreparing, Tranmax's eyes showed a hint\nof surprise. No need. I didn't expect\nyou to have comprehended the momentum\nalso considered grasping the rules of\nheaven and earth. Lucen knelt down from\nall directions. Streams of dark red aura\nsurged in to envelop him. Lucen raised\nhis head, gritting his teeth. To die\nunder this move is your honor. He drew\nthe blade, bissecting blade art. A blade\nslashed straight towards Tramac. He\nshouted loudly. One slash, two halves.\nThe mountain peak exploded with a boom.\nDust and smoke billowing. Lucin\nretracted his blade. Dust swirling all\naround. Voices of discussion from the\ncrowd below drifted up. Where is Master\nTran? Is Master Tran dead? Master Lucin\nwon. Master Tran lost. Lucin's one slash\nindeed lives up to its reputation.\nSuddenly, someone shouted, \"Look\nquickly. What is that up there?\" He was\nin a panic. A phantom image. Could it be\nMaster Trant? Seeing that thing flying\ntowards him, Lucen was terrified. He\nquickly drew his blade. executing the\ndraw slash. But seeing his attack cause\nabsolutely no harm to the opponent, he\nexclaimed in shock, \"What?\" The blade\ncontinued to thrust towards him. \"Aya!\"\nA loud explosion rang out. At this\nmoment, the phantom image slowly shrank.\nTran Mack calmly said, \"The force of\nheaven and earth is merely the remnant\nof the great dao of heaven and earth.\"\nBefore the true great dao, Tranmack\nlooked down at the man lying motionless\non the ground, continuing, \"You are\nnothing but an ant.\" Everyone was\nshocked. Master loose and lost. Master\nTran actually won. The number one genius\nof Dong Lamb. Meanwhile, in Hadu, the\nlive family members seemed unable to\nbelieve their eyes, saying in\nastonishment, \"How is this kid Tranmax\nso strong? So, what should we do? He\nwill settle scores with us sooner or\nlater.\" Lie Dong Duong ordered lie lap\nvan. You immediately send people to\nnotify the five great families to\nestablish a pack.\nLong Duong said worriedly, \"This brat\ntranmac absolutely cannot be allowed to\nlive. Driver to the airport.\" The driver\nobeyed and drove off. At this moment,\nthe navigation system announced, \"Your\nplanned route has changed.\" Leuho is\nsaid in surprise, \"Huh? This doesn't\nseem to be the way to the airport.\"\nTranmax said, \"It's fine. It's just that\nsomeone doesn't want us to leave so\nquickly. The driver laughed. You\nnoticed? Tranmack explained. You have no\ninternal energy, but there are\nfluctuations of heaven and earth origin\nenergy. You're not a martial artist. You\nare an on my OG. The person laughed in\nadmiration. Haha, impressive. Lucen, not\nDao did not die in vain. He frowned and\nasked, \"But do you think that by killing\nthat trash? Lucin, you can look down on\nmy dong lamb cultivation world.\" The car\nsuddenly veered off course. Luh.\nTranmack ahead. The car plunged down the\nhillside, crashing into the cliff,\ncausing a huge explosion. Tranmack\nhugged her in time, asking with concern.\nHow are you? Le new Hoa shook her head.\nI'm Fina. Tramac looked at the car\nturned into scrap metal, sighing, looks\nlike we can't go by car anymore. At this\nmoment, a voice rang out. You won't need\nto ride anything in the future. A little\ncar accident is indeed nothing to you.\nLee Nuhoa was surprised to find a Tai\nChi diagram appearing on the ground. The\nsound echoed all around.\nI don't know why my head suddenly hurts\nso much. Tranmack immediately realized\nthis was the Inyang speech spirit art.\nTransmac channeled energy and shouted,\n\"Get lost.\" The voice sounded again full\nof praise. Master Tran actually\nunderstands Inyong arts. It was the oji\nto hack. He said profoundly, \"No wonder\nyou could break my life claiming ghost\nsound. But having stepped into my Inyong\nformation, don't dream of leaving\nalive.\" He stepped out, casting a spell\nand shouting, \"Inyong cage. Lock them\nup.\" Tranmax snapped his fingers. Break.\nThe magic formation instantly shattered.\nTran Mack raised an eyebrow, saying\ncalmly, \"Just play your trump card\ndirectly. Save some time. What?\" Tattoo\nHack gritted his teeth. \"You're seeking\nyour own death.\" He spat into his palm,\nthen pointed to the sky and shouted,\n\"Eigh-headed war god. Please heed my\nsummons.\" The sky suddenly turned pitch\nblack. A monster appeared, sticking out\nits tongue. Who summoned me? Its other\nthree heads looked towards Ta two hack\nthreatening on my OG. Do you know the\nprize for summoning me? Tatu hack knelt\nand bowed. Respected eight-headed war\ngod, please grant me power to destroy\nthe enemy. It continued, this body of\nyours is too weak. It cannot withstand\nall my power. I'll grant you a little\nthen. Taku Hack's eyes glowed, his tone\ngradually losing humanity. Ah, my whole\nbody seems filled with power. He looked\nat Tranmack and said, \"Master Tran, go\nto hell.\" He rushed straight at the two.\nTranmack channeled energy to create a\nprotective layer for Leu Hoa,\ninstructing her quickly hide over there.\nTramac was knocked away by the force.\nAsh Basha Tranmack thought although it\nis only a part of the eight-headed\nserpent's power it is not something I\ncan currently withstand to kill him I\nalso have to pay a price he continued to\nprovoke Master TR weren't you very\narrogant why not continue being arrogant\nTatu Hack sneered obediently hand over\nyour soul but Tramax said I've been\nwaiting for you for a long time he\nexecuted the time art the monster\nexclaimed in shock no this is the great\ndivine ability of the soul formation\nrealm. How do you know it? It said, \"Who\nexactly are you? You dare to injure me,\nI will definitely kill you.\" But Tramac\nignored it, exerting force to grab. The\nbeast disappeared. At this moment, Tatu\nHack spurred a mouthful of blood. The\nmonster screamed in pain. \"Ah, one of my\nprimordial spirits. I will not forgive\nyou,\" Lee knew Hoa said worriedly. \"That\nreally scared me to death just now,\nTramac. Are you okay?\" Tramac said, \"I'm\nfine.\" Although he actually felt very\nuncomfortable inside, he couldn't tell\nher anything. She looked at the\nmotionless Ta hack and asked, \"Is he\ndead?\" Tranmack explained, \"The reason\nhe could summon the demon god is that he\nmust have sacrificed his own soul. I\ndispersed the power the demon god\ngranted him, so his soul also dissipated\nlike smoke.\" She continued, \"All right,\nthen let's leave here quickly.\" Tramax\nsaid, \"We can't leave just yet.\" Lehoa\nwas puzzled. Why? Tramax shouted, \"Stop\nhiding. Come out.\" As soon as Trramac\nfinished speaking, someone responded,\n\"Master TR indeed living up to the\nreputation.\" Suddenly, a tank appeared\nin front of the two. The voice sounded\nagain. I wonder if this kind of\npreparation is enough to send Master\nTran on his way. The voice changed tone,\nbecoming sharp and cold. Kill them.\nSoldiers inside the tank immediately\nswarmed out. Tranmack reached out to\nshield Lee New Hoa behind him, saying,\n\"Stand behind me. Don't leave.\" She\nresponded fearfully. A soldier shouted,\n\"Fire!\" The cannon on the tank\nimmediately fired a shell. Tranmack\ngently raised his hand, creating a\ndefensive shield. Ginsm smoke filled the\nair, but the two of them were still safe\nand sound. Seeing this, the soldiers\nurged each other, \"Quick, concentrate\nfire. Don't let them get close.\" At this\nmoment, Tranmack wave his hand in a\nslashing motion, shouting, \"Heaven\nslashing sword.\" A sword light swept\nacross the soldiers's necks. They\ngroaned in pain. Ugg. Leit knew. Ho\nwhispered from behind. Tramac, you can\ndo it. I believe in you. Tramac looked\nat the scene before him, thinking,\n\"Shells are useless against me. Why are\nthey willing to let so many soldiers\ncome to throw away their lives?\"\nSuddenly, he saw an artillery shell\nroaring towards them. Tranmac\nimmediately turned his head to remind\nthe still dazed elite new Hoa. It's a\nhowitzer shell. Tramac raised both\nhands, ordering, \"Cover your ears.\nThe shell quickly fell where they were\nstanding. A loud explosion echoed\nthrough the scene. The dust cleared. A\nhuge crater appeared on the ground, but\nthe two of them inside the protective\ncircle were still safe. The nearby tanks\nimmediately retreated. Leuho was still\nsat there covering her ears. She heard\nsomeone ask, \"Are you okay?\" Tramax\nstood proudly in front of her,\ndeclaring, \"It's over.\" He glanced at\nthe protective shield in front of him,\nwhich it cracks. thinking barely managed\nto block it. At the same time, Leuhoa\nasked him in astonishment. Tramac, you\nare you still human? Tranmack looked at\nher in surprise, asking back, \"Huh? What\ndo you mean?\" Le new Hoa voiced her\ndoubt. How can a human block a rocket?\nTramac chuckled. \"Haha, rest assured, I\nam human, just much stronger than\nordinary people.\" Half a month later,\ninside high-rise buildings. Tramax's\nmobile phone on the cabinet rang softly.\nAn excited voice came from a phone.\nMaster, I received news. The ice palace\nis about to appear. Legend has it that\nit is an immortal's cave dwelling. Most\nforces in the ancient marshall world are\npreparing to investigate. Tramac\nanswered sleepily. Mm. I know. Thank for\nyour hard work. Tramack hung up and fell\nin a deep thought. The death of Lu Sin.\nThe destruction of the Kong Nam family.\nAncient martial world. If you dared to\nplot against me behind my back, then\ndon't regret it. At the same time, at\nTien's sun, rolling mountains covered in\nwhite snow. Amidst that place, the\nsounds of fighting were heard from a\ngroup of people besieging a girl. Let's\nsee where you run. Hand over the things\non you. Your compions are all dead.\nDon't waste energy resisting. There's\nalso a hooligan laughing flirtatiously.\nLater, let the brother strip her naked\nand enjoy a bit. Haha. The girl in green\nretorted angrily. You scum of the\nancient Marshall world. I'll fight you\nto the death. Just then, a hand reached\nout to block in between. The person\nsaid, \"No need for you to fight to the\ndeath.\" The arrival was Tranmack. He\nprotected the girl behind his back, then\ndoineeringly declared, \"Here, everyone\nmust listen to me. People of the ancient\nmarshall world all get lost. Finish\nspeaking.\" He pointed his finger at one\nof them. That person immediately fell\nbackward. The surrounding accompllices\ncould only watch. Eldest senior brother\ndied is dead. Tranmax shouted in a deep\nvoice, not scrambling to get lost yet.\nAs soon as he finished speaking, a giant\ndragon appeared behind him, opening its\nbloody mouth and roaring, scaring the\nhooligans out of their wits, and making\nthem flee. Uh, Grandmaster, spare our\nlives. Run quickly. As soon as they\nleft, the girl in green immediately\nknelt on the snow. She smiled, clased\nher hands, and said, Lamb Van thanks the\nGrandmaster for the saving grace.\nTranmack just replied coldly. Your\ncultivation is too low. Even if you\nenter the ice palace, you'll just be\ncannon fodder. Better to leave. Hearing\nthis, Lamb Van immediately stopped him.\nSenior, please stop. Senior, if your\ntarget is also the ice palace, then I\ncan help you. Please, senior, take me\ninto the ice palace. Then just give me\nany random benefit. It will be enough\nfor me to live on for a lifetime.\nTranmack asked her amusedly. Oh, on what\nbasis can you help me? Lamb Van\nhesitated not a bit. took out a piece of\ngreen jade and said, \"This jade piece\nwas obtained by a senior of my sect\nduring the previous opening of the ice\npalace. Perhaps it will be useful.\"\nTrax's hand gently pressed on her hand,\nwhich was tightly clutching the jade.\nBut she continued, \"My sect was small\nand weak, targeted by the ancient\nmarshall world, and has been wiped out.\"\n\"Now I'm the only one left. This is my\nonly possession.\" Tranmack closed his\neyes slightly, then replied, \"If you\ntrust me, give it to me. If you don't\ntrust me, then leave. I won't stop you.\nLambvan looked seriously at the man in\nfront of her and said, \"I trust you,\nsenior,\" looking closely at the jade in\nfront of him. Tramac whispered, \"This\nis\"? He stared intently at the patterns\non the jade, telling himself in his\nheart, \"The carvings on this are little\nJunior's sister.\" After handing the\ntoken to Tranmack, the two of them moved\nforward together in the snowy mountains.\nOn the way, Lamb Van reported, \"Senior,\nthe temperature these past few days has\ndropped to its lowest point. According\nto records, the ice palace is about to\nappear.\" However, Tramax still held that\njade tightly, pondering in silence. He\nthought to himself, \"In the techniques\nof the Shienda sect, only the nine\nnether cold ice art has this effect. But\nthe nine nether cold ice art is only an\nintermediate technique. Little Junior's\nsister couldn't possibly ignore so many\ntop tier techniques to practice this\nkind of technique. There are still too\nmany suspicious points. After walking\nfor a while, a door appeared in front of\nthe two, leading to an unknown place.\nLamb Van immediately cried out, \"Look,\nthe ice palace has appeared. Tramac\nlooked at it and said, \"Let's go.\" But\nwhat they didn't know was that a moment\nlater, those thugs also excitedly\nfollowed. Hurry up. The items inside are\nfirst come, first served. Charge. The\ntreasures inside are all mine. Tranmack\nand Lamb Van walked one after the other\non the white snowy path. Occasionally,\nLamb Van couldn't help but cough\ncontinuously from behind. Tramac turned\nhis head to remind her, \"The further we\ngo in, the heavier the cold energy\nbecomes.\" \"Don't push yourself too hard\nor you'll lose your life.\" Lamb Van\nreplied weakly, \"Senator Senior, rest\nassured I can withstand it. If I don't\ngain anything, going out is also a dead\nend. It's just a matter of time.\" After\nwalking for a while, a hand pointed\nforward, exclaiming, \"Hey, look, you\nguys, a nice pavilion.\" That person\nlooked at the ring of light at the door\nand said, \"There's a restriction here.\nPlaces with restrictions definitely have\ntreasures.\" Suddenly, an arrogant person\nappeared in front of the door, saying,\n\"You bunch of cowards.\" He disdainfully\ntapped on the protective shield. This\nrestriction looks weak. It can\ndefinitely be easily. But before he\ncould finish his sentence, he was flung\naway by an invisible force. Uh just then\na young man laughed and said, \"Haha,\neveryone listened to me.\" He stood\nbefore his people and declared, \"The ice\npalac's restriction is absolutely not an\nordinary thing. Why don't we all work\ntogether, combine our strength to break\nit, and share the treasures inside?\nOtherwise, this trip will be in vain.\"\nHearing that, the people around\nimmediately responded. I agree. I also\napprove. Let's risk it. Everyone\ntogether destroy this damn restriction.\nThe young man looked around once, then\nannounced. Then those who support me,\nplease stand to my side. Those who don't\nagree, please leave. Don't dream of\nwaiting for us to break the restriction\nand then reap the benefits without\neffort. Hearing that, Tramax still stood\nstill. Lamb Van couldn't help but ask\ncuriously, \"Senior, are we\nparticipating?\" Tramac answered\ndecisively, \"Follow me.\" The leading\nyoung man saw the two walking straight\ntoward the main gate and shouted, \"What\ndo you want to do?\" Tranmack kept a cold\nexpression, leading Lamb Van through the\nbarrier. This scene stunned the crowd.\nWhat? The people outside could only gape\nand exclaim. He wasn't stopped by the\nrestriction. Could it be that he has the\ntoken of this ice pavilion? On this\nside, Lamb Van was also extremely\nsurprised. We passed through the\nrestriction. Tranmack explained\nimmediately. The patterns on the jade\npendant you gave me correspond to this\nstone door. You really help a great\ndeal. Then Tranmack calmly pushed open\nthe large door in front of him and said,\n\"Let's go in.\" Lamb Van obediently\nfollowed behind. Seeing that, the crowd\nimmediately rushed up, punching and\nkicking the barrier while screaming\nincessantly. They got in. Let's quickly\njoin forces to destroy this restriction.\nBut as soon as they touched the barrier,\nthey were all blasted away by an\ninvisible force. They could only moan.\nOuch. What on earth is going on? The\ntreasures are about to be taken by them.\nThe young man who intended to lead was\ngrinding his teeth in anger, thinking,\n\"Hump, even if you get the treasures,\nyou won't be able to take them away.\" At\nthe same time, inside the structure,\nTram Macack and Lamb Van looked at the\nsurrounding scene and exclaimed, \"The\nthings inside are really messy.\" Lamb\nVan also uttered, \"It seems we are not\nthe only ones who have been here.\"\nTramac replied, \"Since someone obtained\na token related to the ice palace,\nnaturally, someone has been here to\nscout. Let's go up and see.\" After\nsearching for a while, Lamb Van said\nhelplessly, \"Why is there nothing here?\"\nThen the two continued step by step up\nthe stairs, deciding to go higher.\nTranmax saw the barrier ahead, a bit\nsurprised, and said, \"There's a\nrestriction. Moreover, it's different\nfrom the restriction outside. Perhaps\nthis place hasn't been looted.\" Lambin\nasked curiously, \"Then what should we\ndo?\" \"The restriction we could pass had\nno treasures. The restriction we can't\npass has treasures.\" Sigh. Tranmack only\nreplied softly, \"Don't rush, saying that\nhe raised his hand to cast the spell.\"\nLamb Van stood by watching intently.\nTranmack thought in his heart. Although\nthis restriction has changed, it still\nbears the traces of the Shienda sect.\n\"It seems the owner of this place, if\nnot little Junior's sister, is\ndefinitely related to her.\" Lamb Van\ncouldn't help but exclaim, \"Senior, can\nyou open it?\" She was extremely curious\nin her heart. What is this person's\nbackground after all? While she was deep\nin thought, Tranmack had walked over to\nadmire the nearby treasures and praised,\n\"Wow, these treasures are pretty good.\"\nTranmax satisfiedly named each item\ngolden spring runic lotus seed, nine\nheaven's earth cashache, living soul\ngrass. These are all cultivation\nresources that I'm lacking. Lamb van\nfollowed behind and said, \"These\nmedicinal materials are indeed very\npowerful, but my cultivation base is too\nlow. Using them would be no different\nfrom suicide. It's good that they are\nuseful to you, senior. Tranmack turned\nslightly, handed an object to Lamb Van,\nthen said, \"I just happen to get two\ncultivation technique manuals that I\ndon't use. I'm gifting them to you.\nConsider it fulfilling my promise to\nyou.\" Lamb Van was astonished to the\nextreme. Looking at the object in her\nhand and exclaiming, \"Oh my god, does\nsuch a profound cultivation technique\nexist in the world?\" Tranmack looked at\nLamb Van's joyful face, feeling a bit\nguilty and thinking, \"Actually, this is\njust trash technique in the cultivation\nworld, but for this planet, it is indeed\na superb item.\" Suddenly, Lamb Van Shily\nsaid, \"But Senior, this technique is so\nprecious. I I cannot accept it.\" She\nheld out the technique and continued,\n\"Or maybe you should keep it.\" Tranmack\nfirmly refused. \"Take it with me here.\nNo one can snatch things from your\nhands.\" Lamb Van only then happily\naccepted it, replying, \"Really? Thank\nyou, senior.\" Afterwards, the two walked\nout of the room. That young man\nimmediately shouted. They came out.\nTranmac and Lamb Van stood there\nsilently listening to their noisy\ndiscussion. \"What treasures are inside\nafter all, kid? What treasures did you\nget?\" The leader immediately ordered,\n\"Quickly, take them out and share with\neveryone.\" Tranmack just smiled\ncontemptuously. Tell me to share. Are\nyour brains frozen? Lamb Van worriedly\ncalled out, \"Senior.\" Tranmac\nimmediately comforted her, \"Wait here.\nDon't go out. Let me teach them a\nlesson.\" Tramac quickly stepped out of\nthe barrier. He scolded softly, \"A bunch\nof rabble.\" Tranmack glanced at them,\nthen asked in a deep voice, \"Whoever\nwants to rob me, make your move.\"\nHearing that, the people around rubbed\ntheir fists and said disdainfully, just\nbluffing, \"Can you alone fight against\nour entire ancient martial world? Let me\nteach this brat who doesn't know the\nimmensity of heaven and earth a lesson.\nTranmack glanced at the one who just\nsneered and asked, \"Is your brain okay?\"\nJust stepped into the grandmaster realm.\nNot worthy for me to act. Tranmax words\nimmediately angered the bald guy. You\narrogant bastard. But before he could\nmake a move, Tranax shouted coldly, \"Get\nlost.\" Behind him appeared the image of\na giant dragon, scaring the bald guy\nuntil his nose ran, screaming in terror.\n\"Dragon! a giant dragon. Then Tranmack\nconfidently declared, \"You all come at\nonce. Don't waste time anymore.\" Seeing\nthe scene before their eyes, the leading\nyoung man snorted angrily and said, \"You\nare just using some despicable secret\ntechnique.\" Hearing the leader say that\nthe weaker ones around immediately\njoined in a mockery. Moreover, that\nguy's strength is nothing special. We\nare not afraid of you. Young Master\nThang is right. Everyone attacked\ntogether. They laughed and spoke like\nthat, but still no one dared to take a\nstep forward. The crowd urged each\nother, \"Hey, go up. Why don't you go up?\nYou go first, then I'll go.\" Tramac\nfinally couldn't help laughing loudly.\nHuh? You bunch are both greedy and\ncowardly, even more despicable than a\nguy just now. Young Master Thang, the\nleader, shouted at this moment,\n\"Everyone listen to me. As people of the\nancient marshall world, my Thong family\nabsolutely cannot let the treasure fall\ninto his hands. Whoever is willing to\ncharge with me will have the right to\nshare the treasure. After speaking,\nyoung Master Thang calculated silently.\nI must incite them. Hearing that, the\ncrowd was immediately provoked, rushing\ntowards Tranmack. That's right.\nOtherwise, the face of our ancient\nmarshall world will be completely lost.\nEveryone attacked together. Kill him. A\ncold glint flashed in Tranmax's eyes. He\nsilently cursed. Ants. Trax shouted one\nword. Get lost. Then he just waved his\nhand and the crowd fell flat backwards.\nHaving dealt with the crowd, Tranmax\nswept his eyes forward and said, \"The\none who deserves to die is you.\" Young\nMaster Thang exclaimed in surprise,\n\"Huh?\" He turned to run while\nthreatening. \"If you dare to kill me,\nyou are opposing the Thwang family.\"\nTranmack didn't say a second word,\nimmediately launched an attack on him,\nthen gently replied, \"Then I will wipe\nout your entire Thong family.\" An old\nman in the crowd seeing this scene\ncouldn't help but be terrified, shouting\nloudly, \"You killed the young master.\"\nThe thong family will not let you off.\nAs soon as he finished speaking, a force\nstruck his chest. Tranmax slowly walked\ncloser to them and asked softly, \"Now,\ndoes anyone else want to rob me?\"\nimmediately waved their hands in refusal\nrepeatedly, \"No, no, no. We dare not. We\ndare not.\" Having handled the matter\nhere, Tranmack turned to Lamb Van and\nsaid, \"Come out, let's go.\" She stepped\nout and asked softly, \"Where are we\ngoing now?\" Tranmack just gently\nreplied, \"Just keep going straight\nahead.\" The two turned their backs and\nleft, leaving the crowd staring at their\nbacks, discussing regretfully. \"Should\nwe continue following?\" A sensible\nperson replied, \"Even if there are\ntreasures, it won't be our turn.\" An\nunwilling person said, \"Not necessarily.\nWith his strength, his standards must be\nextremely high. we might have a chance\nto pick up things he doesn't fancy.\nHearing this, the person who asked\nimmediately replied. Wells said, \"Let's\ngo then.\" Meanwhile, Tramac walked for a\nwhile, then suddenly stopped. He looked\nat the crowd in front of him and said,\n\"It seems there isn't just one entrance\nto the ice palace.\" The crowd also saw\nTranmack. They whispered, \"Hey, look\nover there. Is he also from the ancient\nmarshall world?\" The person next to him\nreplied, \"It seems it is them.\" The\ngroup that had just been following\nTranmack also unexpectedly ran up to the\nfront, happily saying, \"Oh my god, isn't\nthat someone from the sixth grade sex?\nHurry over and join them.\" The two\ngroups instantly became close, chatting\nanimatedly. Great. Now we don't need to\nfear that brat anymore. Did everyone\njust arrive here? Just now, there was a\nvery strong brat conflicting with us.\nSomeone unaware of the situation saw a\nfigure. Suddenly exclaimed, \"Huh?\" A\ntall old man appeared in front of\nTramac. This person was Master Ton of\nthe Vosan sect. He asked softly, \"I\nheard your distinguished self has a\nmethod to break the restriction.\"\nTranmac coldly replied, \"That's right.\"\nHe thought to himself, \"He is a divine\nrealm powerhouse.\" Upon hearing this,\nMaster Ton Tong immediately reached out\nhis hand and shouted, \"Take it out and\nshare it with everyone under everyone's\nexpectant gaze.\" Tranmac answered with\nonly one word, \"No.\" Master Ton Tong saw\nthat shouting didn't work. So he spoke\ngently, \"Young man, hand over the\ntechnique to break the restriction, and\nyou'll be a friend of my V son's sect.\"\nBut Tranmax still firmly refused. I\ncan't climb that high. Master Ton Tongue\ncouldn't help but be pleased hearing\nthis. It seems you know your place\nknowing you can't reach up to my Vo\nsunset. But immediately after, Tramac\nretorted, \"I mean, you guys can't climb\nthat high.\" Master Ton Tong finally\ncouldn't hold back, shouting angrily.\nAre you provoking this old man? Young\nbut seeking death already. After\nspeaking, he calculated in his heart.\nNo, this brat is so arrogant. Maybe he\nhas some strong backing. I can't be the\nfirst bird to stick its neck out,\nletting Q Hoa and KF fuang benefit. Then\nhe opened his mouth gently again. Young\nman, I was almost fooled by you. If you\nreally have the ability, then break this\nice palace restriction for me to see.\nTramac heard this and saw through his\nintention, saying, \"No need for goating.\nThis ice palace to me is just like my\nown backyard. Having said that, he waved\nhis hand, calling Lamb Van, \"Follow me.\"\nThe two gently walked through the\nbarrier. Tran Mack even intentionally\nsaid loudly, \"We just enter if we want\nto.\" Master Ton Tongue stood behind\nwatching. Couldn't help but be extremely\nshocked, veins popping on his face,\ngritting his teeth, and exclaiming, \"He\nreally can break the restriction. Damn\nit, I should have killed him just now.\"\nBefore entering, Tranmack turned his\nhead and said one sentence. By the way,\nno need to pretend to be virtuous and\nhighly respected. It's disgusting. At\nthis moment, an exquisite sculpture\nappeared in front of the two. Lamb Van\nwas stunned, blurting out, \"The person\non this statue looks exactly like the\nfigure on my jade pendant.\" Tranmack\nstared intently at the statue in front\nof him. Softly replied, \"That's right.\"\nHe said to himself in his heart, \"Little\nJunior, sister.\" Tramac also reminded\nLamb Van. Follow me and observe the\nsurroundings. Don't touch anything\nrandomly. The two gradually walked to a\ndoor. Linen called out softly. Uh,\nSenior, the other rooms have no\nrestrictions and nothing inside. Only\nthis room has a restriction at the door.\nIt must be unusual. Tranmack heard this\nand placed his hand to sense it. This\nstream of consciousness is the orthodox\nbarrier of the Huenda sect. Little\nJunior sister, are you here? Tranmack\nmade up his mind. Then let me see what\nexactly is inside. The two stood before\na pitch black room seeing only a box\ninside. Lamb van asked softly, \"Senior,\nthat box.\" Tranmack opened it without\nhesitation. He thought, \"What exactly is\nin this box that requires a barrier to\nprotect it?\" Tranmack took out the\nletter inside to read. He guessed this\nwas a handwritten letter from his little\njunior sister only to see the back of a\nwoman appear in the letter. The person\nopened her mouth and said, \"If a\ndisciple of the Tien Huins sect is\ndestined to come here after forming the\ngolden core, please look after the snow\ngod palace for me.\" The realm breaking\npill in the bottle can lend you a hand.\nTranmax stared at the letter in his hand\nwhile pondering. Only a disciple of the\nTien Huins sect can break the\nimmeasurable barrier. She did this to\nprevent outsiders from intruding.\nWhere's the snow god Palace? I have\nnever heard of it. The letter says to\nlook after the snow god palace after\nforming the golden core. Does it mean\none can only find the snow god palace\nafter cultivating to the golden core\nrealm? A question quietly rose in his\nheart. This letter seems to have been\nwritten in a great hurry. Could little\nJunior's sister have encountered danger?\nTran Mack hurriedly destroyed the\nletter, thinking in his heart, \"There\nare still too many questions.\" Tranmack\nlooked at the remaining bottle in his\nhand, thinking, \"But fortunately, I am\nin need of the realm breaking pill in\nthis bottle. Can only call it fake.\"\nTranmack turned his head slightly and\nsaid, \"Let's go out.\" Lamb Van couldn't\nhelp but wonder. Leaving already? No\nearthshattering treasures? Tranmack\nreplied, \"This place is just the\nresidence of a cultivator. There are no\ntreasures.\" When the two of them walked\nout, the group of young people\nimmediately shouted, \"They're out.\" And\nsomeone asked, \"Kid, what did you get\ninside?\" Another person sighed softly.\n\"I recognize him. He is Grandmaster\nTran.\" Master Ton Tong stood in the\nmiddle of the crowd. Having heard\neverything, he angrily warned. So you\nare Grandmaster Tran of the secular\nworld. I advise you to best hand over\nthe treasures. Otherwise, do you think\nyou alone can resist all of us? Tranmack\njust calmly replied, \"If I say there\nbasically no treasures inside, would you\nbelieve it?\" hearing this. Nam hackvu of\nthe Q Hois sect in the crowd laughed\nloudly and said, \"Huh, such a powerful\nrestriction. And you say they're no\ntreasures? Do you take us for fools?\"\nImmediately after, Liu Kim Vu of the\nKuang sect also aggressively stepped out\nto threaten. I see no need to talk\nnonsense anymore. Kill him directly.\nSnatch the treasures. A woman wearing a\nhat covering her face suddenly spoke up.\nI feel that us doing this is unfair.\nBullying the few with the many. I don't\nwant to participate. Luke Kim Vu frowned\nand explained to her fairy lang thong\ngrandmaster trans strength is very\nstrong. If we let him go now our ancient\nmarshall world will never be at peace.\nFor the safety of the sex you must take\naction. Must kill him right here.\nFinally the woman sighed and replied all\nright. Having said that the crowd boiled\nwith enthusiasm rushing towards Tran\nMack together shouting in unison charge.\nTranmack lowered his head softly said\nnot knowing good from bad. Then facing a\npunch from Nam Hackvu, Tranmack blocked\nit with just one hand. Luke Keem Vu took\nadvantage of his distraction, carrying a\nsword and rushing over, shouting loudly,\n\"Go to hell.\" But fortunately, Tranmack\nnimly stepped back, dodging a slash.\nFinally, Nam Hackvu couldn't help but\nshout, \"Enough! Don't fight move by move\nanymore. Use the strongest moves. Can't\nlet him leave here alive.\" Tranmac\nquickly leaped high up. Nam Hakvu\ncouldn't help but ask contemptuously,\n\"Want to run?\" Then several swords were\nseen gathering in one place. They\nshouted in unison, \"Four Swords Union.\"\nIt was the four people Nam Hack Vu, Luke\nKim, Vu, Master Ton, and Fairy Lang\nThuang joining forces. Tramac was also a\nbit surprised. Didn't expect you to know\ncombination techniques, but he\nimmediately regained his fighting will.\nHeaven slashing sword dance, great da,\nand nine swords. Tranmack just slightly\nclosed his eyes, uttering two words,\nheaven burial. In an instant, a swirling\nvortex of mist appeared around the four\npeople. They asked in astonishment,\n\"What is happening? What is surrounding\nus?\" \"No, I can't control the\nsurrounding spiritual energy anymore.\" A\nsecond later, they fell freely into the\nground. At this moment, Nam Hakvu\nrealized in horror, \"Oh no, not good.\nThis is a space-time rift.\" He screamed\nmiserably now. At the same time, the\ncrowd watching from outside only knew to\nlook at each other blankly and ask, \"Why\ndid the sky suddenly turn dark just now?\nWhat happened? Don't understand anything\nat all. There is a figure ahead. Could\nit be the four elders of the four great\nsex lost?\" Tranmack arrogantly put his\nhands in his pockets walking out from a\nsmoke. He asked softly, \"Now, is there\nanyone else who wants to rob my stuff?\"\nLamb Van immediately ran over happily.\nSenior, that's great. Suddenly, a\nviolent tremor was transmitted. Lamb Van\nhurly shouted, \"Ah, senior, this seems\nto be a sign that the ice palace is\nabout to close.\" But why so fast? Tran\nMax stroked his chin and thought, \"It\ncould be because I broke the\nimmeasurable barrier causing this place\nto lose the spiritual energy supporting\nit, so it's closing early. I'm afraid\nthe ice palace won't open again in the\nfuture. In short, we can leave.\" Then\nthe two continued to walk out of the ice\nmountain. Lamb Van sighed softly,\nfinally back to this warm world. Just at\nthis moment, Tramac turned his head and\nsaid, \"Hey, you don't need to follow me\nanymore. If you can stay anonymous in\nthe future and concentrate on\ncultivating those two techniques, you\nwill definitely be able to avenge your\nsect in the future. Let's part ways\nhere.\" Lamb Van could only be stunned,\nbut she quickly clased her hands in\nsalute, replying, \"Yes, thank you for\nyour great kindness, senior. Having been\nlooked after by you these past few days,\nthis little girl will definitely repay\nSenior's great virtue in the future.\nAfter parting with her, Tran Mack\nimmediately calculated the eyes palace\nmatter is considered done. Must seize\nthe time to return to Yin Qui Lake for\nseclusion. But what Tran Mack didn't\nknow was that behind his back, someone\nwas secretly monitoring his every move.\nA few days later, the six great sects\nand eight great families of the ancient\nmarshall world all sent out a divine\nrealm powerhouse and 10 elites forming a\nteam swearing to kill Tranmac. At the\nfoot of a certain mountain, someone\nlaughed loudly. Haha, this place is\nreally not bad. The old man laughing\nexcitedly was Elder Lamb Vany of the\nConfang sect. He continued, \"Spiritual\nenergy turning in a mist. This is all\nspiritual energy.\" after catching him\nmust force him to create a few more\nplaces like this. Saying that he\nimmediately leaped up. Lamb Vanian flew\nhigh up looking down at the building\nbelow simultaneously warning.\nGrandmaster Tran I am Lamb Vanian of the\nConfuang sect. I advise you to best\nsurrender. I can still spare your life.\nThen hand over this place to be the\nmountain gate for our con fuang sect. At\nthe same time, the gate of the building\nbelow was also in an uproar. A group of\nyoung men stood in front of the door\nshouting, not knowing good from bad. The\npunitive expedition form up. Break the\nmountain guarding formation of this\nmountain. Brothers, charge. Use all your\nstrength to break the barrier. They\npunched and kicked the protective cage.\nWhile cheering each other on. Everyone\ndo your best. Someone shouted angrily.\nMaster Tran, weren't you very majestic\nwhen you killed people from our ancient\nmarshall world? Why do you want to be a\nturtle? Shrinking its head now inside\nthe house. Tang Tang cried out in fear.\nOh my god, they are attacking so\nfiercely. Master is still in seclusion.\nWhat should we do? Tran tongue too\nlooked determined and said, \"Dlay as\nlong as we can. Block them if we can. I\nhave arranged a safe place for lie to\nfang and the others to hide. Even if we\ndie, we must protect master.\" But just\nthen, hurried footsteps came from the\nouter area. Among the guards holding\nguns, one pressed his hand to his\nearpiece to report. Report: people from\nthe ancient marshall world have started\nattacking the Yinqui Lake defensive\nformation. The other end immediately\nresponded. Understood. Dragon group\ncontinue to stand by. Once the formation\nis broken, the dragon group must protect\nTranmac at all costs. The guard replied,\n\"Yes.\" At this time in a lie family's\nliving room, Lie Dong Duong and his son\nLrake were watching the show out front,\ndiscussing, \"It seems that Brad is\nscared. As soon as the defensive\nformation is broken, that Brat will\ndefinitely die.\" He gloated at the scene\nof them attacking the protective cage\nwith all their might. Unable to help but\nbe overjoyed, the great calamity of our\nlive family is finally about to be\nresolved. At that same moment, a\nmysterious person in a cloak suddenly\nappeared, muttering, \"It should be right\nnear here.\" Most of the formation\nfoundations are placed where the power\nof the five elements gathers. When he\nlooked up, he exclaimed in surprise,\n\"Found it.\" The young man in the cloak\nraised the hammer in his hand with\nsatisfaction, then secretly exclaimed,\n\"Fortunately, I prepared the formation\nbreaking talisman specifically used to\ndestroy formation foundations.\" Saying\nthat, he smashed the hammer down with\nforce. In an instant, the protective\ncage guarding Tran Tongu's residence\nshook violently. The young men attacking\ncontinuously also stopped, exclaiming,\n\"The formation is broken. Charge. Kill\nMaster Tran. Snatch back the ice palace\ntreasures.\" On the side of the guards,\nthey receive the order. Dragon group\nmove out. Lambian's back shook as he\nlaughed loudly. \"Huh? Your formation is\nbroken, Master Tran. I'll see how long\nyou, a shrinking turtle, can keep this\nup.\" He also started to rush forward,\nunleashing a sword cheese slash. A huge\nforce from him rushed forward but was\nsuddenly blocked by another force. It\nturned out to be Yin Quinton appearing.\nShe shouted, \"Don't even think about\nit.\" After blocking the opponent's\nattack, Yin Quinton questioned, \"Why are\nyou barging into my Yin Quake?\" Lamb\nVanian looked at the person in front of\nhim in surprise, exclaiming, \"Reaching\nthe divine realm at such a young age.\nMaster transervant is indeed\nextraordinary, little girl. If you're\nwilling to take me as your master, I\nwill definitely give you everything and\neven let you be my son's concubine. How\nabout it? Yin Quinton just coldly swung\nthe flaming long sword in her hand\ntowards the opponent, asking, \"Are you\nsleeptalking before you've even woken\nup?\" Lamb Vanian glanced at the sword\nresting on his neck. He gritted his\nteeth and said, \"Not cherishing the\nopportunity one gave you, you will rag.\"\nBut before he could finish, Yin Quinton\ncouldn't help but shout. Shut up. Lamb\nVanian couldn't help but be startled\nimmediately cursing. Little girl, you\nhave no martial ethics. Sneak attacking\nan old man like me. Yin Quinn Ton\nglanced at him, thinking to herself, no\ngood. The difference in strength is too\ngreat. If not for the Phoenix cry sword\nand heavenly Phoenix sword in my hands\ntaught by Tramac, I wouldn't be his\nmatch at all. While he is\nunderestimating the enemy now and\ndoesn't want to corner me yet, I must\nuse all my strength to strive for\nvictory. Thinking for a moment, Yin\nQuinton quickly turned around,\nunleashing a move. Phoenix dances in the\nnine heavens. As Yin Quinton rushed\ntowards Lamb Vanian, she transformed\ninto a fire phoenix. But Lamb Vanian was\nno ordinary person. He shouted, \"Great\nriver soared intent. His powerful\nstrength completely dispersed Yin\nQuinton, who was flying towards him. Now\nshe lay groaning in pain on the ground.\nUggh. H Yin Quinton suppressed the\nintense pain. She knew clearly that\nhaving just reached the divine realm,\nshe really couldn't fight him. Then Yin\nQuinton didn't hesitate, flying up to\ncontinue fighting. Seeing this, Lamb\nVanian laughed and said, \"My condition\njust now is still valid. You can be my\ndaughter-in-law too. Your master, Master\nTran, won't live much longer anyway.\"\nBut hearing this, Yin Quinton became\neven more angry. shouting in your\ndreams. Lamb Vanian self-esteem was\nhurt, cursing, \"You want to die?\" Yin\nQuinton nimblely raised her sword,\nblocking a slash from him, but her\nstrength was completely insufficient.\nYin Quinton was sent flying again, lying\nflat on the ground. Just then, Tranong 2\ncame out and saw this scene. He\nimmediately shouted anxiously, \"Junior\nsister.\" Tran Tong 2 held Yin Quinton in\nhis arms, asking with concern, \"Junior\nSister, how are you? Are you hurt\nanywhere? Hold on a little longer. Yin\nQuinn Tong glanced at him, replying, I\nwon't die, but the meridians in my body\nare in chaos. I can't fight anymore.\nTran tongue too began to instruct. I\nwent to investigate just now. Sure\nenough, the formation foundation was\ndestroyed by someone. I'm afraid there\nare experts secretly observing outside.\nYou and Tang Tang go call master.\nQuickly leave through the secret\npassage. Just then, Lamb Vanian jumped\nin front of them. Tran Tongu immediately\nstood out, shielding Yin Quinton behind\nhim, preparing to deal with the person\nin front. As a senior brother, at this\nmoment, I cannot help but stand in front\nof my junior sister. Yin Quinton turned\nto go inside. Before leaving, she\nspecifically reminded her senior\nbrother, \"Take care.\" Seeing this, Lamb\nVanian understood. He asked softly,\n\"Want to run?\" Tranung too spread his\narms to block the way. Lamb Vanian\nimmediately ordered the junior brothers\nbehind him. Everyone get him for me.\nTran Tong too looked at them in\nsurprise, exclaiming, \"More than 10\ndivine realm powerhouses.\" He couldn't\nhelp but think, \"It seems hard to escape\nthis calamity today.\" At the same time,\nYin Quinton was inside, constantly\nbanging on her master's door. She\nknocked while calling out, \"Master,\nmaster, run quickly. Don't stay in\nseclusion anymore.\" Tang Tang standing\nbehind could only say, \"It's no use.\nWe've been knocking for a long time.\"\nYin Quinton quickly turned her head to\nremind Tang Tang, you continue knocking.\nI'm going out to help senior brother.\nHearing this, Tang Tang couldn't help\nbut worry. But sister, you can't fight\nanymore. Yan Quinton placed her hand on\nher chest and said, \"Staying here means\ndeath, too. Might as well go out and\nfight side by side with senior brother\nuntil the very last moment. Then she\nquickly ran out, shouting, \"Senior\nbrother.\" Yin Quinton reported softly.\n\"Master is still in seclusion. Can't\nwake him up. I'm here with you. Let's\ndelay as long as we can.\nSince it's come to this, let's live and\ndie together. Just then, a red dragon\nappeared from nowhere. Yen Quinton\ncouldn't help but exclaim in surprise,\n\"What?\" The dragon slowly crawled into\nthe courtyard. Lambians group was also\nstartled and terrified, asking each\nother, \"This is this really a dragon?\nWhy is there a dragon here? Could this\ndragon be raised by Master Tran?\" Yin\nQuinton looked at the red dragon in\nfront, unable to help but be excited.\nThe red-scaled spirit snake has\nappeared. We can delay for a while\nlonger, but the group of young men urged\neach other. We are all divine realm\npowerhouses. Why fear it? Then they\nrushed up. Lambian cheered them on from\nbelow. Everyone, let's kill that flood\ndragon. Yin Quinton covered her mouth,\nsighing inwardly. Redscaled spirit\nsnake. I'm afraid your cultivation will\nbe exhausted today. saw the saw the the\ncrowd below continuously attacked the\nred dragon. It roared ferociously in\npain. They just kept attacking the red\ndragon's face relentlessly. Lamb Vanian\ncouldn't help laughing. Huh? It seems\nthis flood dragon is about to be ground\ninto a paced by our combined efforts.\nHearing this, the young men beside him\nalso spat. Haha, I thought it was some\ntrue dragon. Turns out it's just a flood\ndragon. Just as they were mocking, a\nfamiliar voice rang out, scolding them\nfor being stupid. Lamb Vanian and the\nothers immediately lost all interest.\nThey turned their heads looking for who\nwas so arrogant. They only saw the red\ndragon gradually shrink then burrow in a\nTranmax body. Seeing this scene, Lamb\nVanian asked in surprise, \"You are\nMaster Tran?\" Yin Quinn Ton excitedly\nlooked up at Tranmack, blurting out,\n\"Master has finally come out of\nseclusion.\" Tranmac looked coldly at the\nstrangers, asking indifferently, \"Didn't\nyou want to kill me? Why don't you even\nrecognize me? You bunch of idiots being\nspoken to like that by Tranmack.\nEveryone started to surround Tranmack,\nthreatening, \"Hand over the things you\ngot from the ice palace. That way, maybe\nwe will spare your life.\" Tranmack just\nchuckled softly, replying, \"Then I have\nto say sorry because I will absolutely\nnot let you leave this place alive.\"\nHearing Tranmack provoke them like that.\nA raging fire seemed to burn in Lamb\nVanian's eyes. About to die and still\ntough mouthed, he executed the great\nriver sword in tin again, slashing down\nwith one sword. But Tranmack had\nappeared behind Lamb Vanian at some\npoint and under his surprise gaze softly\nuttered two words, \"Die.\" Saying that,\nTranmack quickly drew a line across Lamb\nVanian's neck. Lamb Vanian immediately\nfell freely from high above. Seeing\nthis, the group of young men asked each\nother in panic, \"Huh? What did he\nstrike? Why didn't I see his movements\nclearly? Is Brother Lamb dead? Then\nTramac glanced at them, saying, \"It's\nyour turn.\" This group hesitated a bit\ndue to fear, someone suggested. It seems\nwe have to join forces to have a chance\nto fight him. But immediately, someone\nstill couldn't help but say fearfully,\nbut he killed Brother Lamb in one move.\nWe The person hadn't finished speaking\nwhen the one who suggested loudly\ndecided, \"Everyone don't give up now. We\ncan only charge.\" As soon as he finished\nspeaking, the group quickly rushed\ntowards Tranmack. They urged each other,\n\"Go avenge Brother Lamb. Chop him into\nmincemeat.\" Tranmack smiled, watching\nthem rush towards him. He immediately\nexecuted the great down nine swords.\nUsing just a few sword strikes, he\nquickly dealt with this small fry. Yin\nQuinton and Tran Tong 2 were both\nstunned, blurting out, \"One one.\" A\nmoment later, Tramac landed. He took out\ntwo pills and said, \"Take these.\"\nTranmac also instructed, \"Regulate your\nbreath. Heal your wounds.\" Yin Quinton\nhurriedly waved her hand to refuse. \"No\ncan do, master. Such precious items.\"\nBut Tranmack only explained, \"Healing\ninjuries is urgent. I still have other\nmatters to attend to. You two just stay\nhere and rest well.\" Afterward, Tranac\nappeared where the members of the dragon\nteam were lying scattered about. Tramax\nspoke seriously to a dragon team member\nsitting against a nearby rock. You\nmembers of the dragon team used firearms\nto fight against many with few bind time\nfor me. I owe Hasha this favor. Come\nhere. I will heal your injuries. The\nmysterious cloaked figure continued to\nfollow behind Tranmack, listening as he\ncontinued. The formation foundation\nneeds to be arranged more carefully. She\ngritted her teeth and whispered, \"Those\npieces of trash actually let Tran Mack\nescape with his life. No, I cannot clash\nhead-on with them. When Tramac returns,\nI must continue to utilize the ancient\nmartial world. When Tranm returned, Yin\nQuinton and Tran Tong two spoke in\nunison. Master, you're back. Tranmack\nsimply gave a soft matum. Still\nregulated your breath. I have prepared\nsome things. Tramac took out several\nbottles one after another, saying, \"This\nis healing medicine refined for you,\ntoo. You two and the survivors of the\ndragon team. Please take care of them a\nbit more. After all, they sacrifice\nquite a lot.\" Tran tongue too dazily\naccepted them replying yes thank you\nmaster Tramac in constructed a few more\nsentences I have rearranged the mountain\nprotection gran array you two just rest\nwith peace of mind tramac added this\ntime for the two of you it can actually\nbe considered a good thing now I will\npass on to you a higher level immortal\ncultivation technique remember well do\nnot spread it to outsiders yin quinton\nobediently replied yes master half a\nmonth later at the trans family home in\ngood Duong. Another group of people\nappeared at the door, asking, \"Is this\nMaster Tran's house?\" The green-haired\nyouth leading them looked at the mansion\nahead, laughing. \"This courtyard looks\nquite luxurious. Is this Tran family\nvery rich?\" He came from the Kong Tong\nsect of the ancient Marshall world.\nNamed Cup Trangier, he continued\ndisdainfully. \"I feel its gold and jade\non the outside, but rot and decay on the\ninside.\" A subordinate behind him\nimmediately chimed in. \"Young master,\nwhat use is money? Strength is the most\nimportant thing. Hearing this, Kak\nTruang CA expressed agreement. True\nenough. Come, let's go inside and see\nwhat that master train looks like. When\nthey entered, a security guard stepped\nout to block them. Hey, what you people\nwant? But they were extremely arrogant,\npunching the guard in the face and\nshouting, \"Scram!\" The guard was\nimmediately sent flying, lying prone on\nthe ground. The subordinates behind\nimmediately flattered. \"Young Master\nCuck, young master is too formidable.\nYour internal power has improved again.\nWe worship young master cuck trang said\narrogantly said does this kind of trash\ndeserve to block my path just then\ntranmack appear behind them speaking up\nwhat a coincidence I came back to visit\nmy grandfather and just happened to\nencounter someone causing trouble cuck\ntranga was startled immediately turning\nhis head to ask who are you I came to\nfind master tran I want to fight him\ncall him out here for me tranmac asked\nback provocatively why should I compete\nwith you cuck truang ca looked at the\nperson in front of him in surprise\nimmediately asking, \"It's you. You look\ntoo skinny and weak. If you're afraid\nand agree to admit defeat, I might let\nyou off.\" Cut trang looked at Tranmack\nbefore him, deluding himself as he\nthought inwardly. I'll record this on my\nphone later and bring it back to show\nher. She will definitely like me, but he\nonly received a disdainful glance from\nTranmack, who said, \"You are not worthy\nfor me to make a move.\" Cut Truang CA's\nself-esteem was immediately hurt. He\nrushed toward Tramac, shouting, \"What\ndid you say? You You dare look down on\nme?\" Tramac just gave a cold snort, then\nraised his hand to channel energy. Cut\ntruang CA was immediately tightly bound\nby invisible threads all over his body.\nHe cried out in confusion. \"Huh? What's\nhappening to me? Damn it. Let me go. Let\nme go.\" Tranmack immediately said a\ncondition. Releasing you is fine, but\nyou must tell the truth. Kuck Trangier\nanswered without hesitation. Ask\nwhatever you want. I promise not to\nspeak half a word of lie. Tramac then\nasked, \"Where do you come from?\" Cuck\nTruang CA put on an arrogant expression\nand replied, \"Speaking it out will scare\nyou to death. I come from the ancient\nmartial world.\" Hearing this, Tranmack\nbecame even more interested and pressed.\nOh, what identity? One week ago at the\nYin family in Hadu, Yin Quinton rushed\nin, frowning. Father, grandfather, why\ndid you call me home so urgently? Did\nsomething happen? The middle-aged man\nsitting on the chair was Quinton's\nfather, Yin Man Shuen. He grinned\nbroadly and said, \"Quinton is back.\"\nBeside him, a long-bearded elder also\nwaved to her with a smile. \"Oh my, come\nsit here quickly.\" This old gentleman\nwas her grandfather, Yan and Trong.\nSeeing them smiling so radiantly and\nwelcoming her so enthusiastically, Yin\nQuinton immediately had a bad\npremonition. It was strange. Normally\nthey were as cold as ice, rarely smiling\neven during holidays. So why did they\nsuddenly have this expression? Yen\nManuin glanced at an old man and spoke.\nNothing is wrong, Quinton. Today we\nwanted you to meet this relative. The\nold man narrowed his eyes slightly.\nSpeaking with hidden meaning. Not bad.\nThat master tr was actually able to\ncultivate a divine realm powerhouse for\nmy Han family. Hearing this, Quinton was\nstunned, stammering. Han family you are.\nYen Manuin smirked stood up and slowly\nintroduced. This is the first time you\ntwo have met. Do you feel any sense of\nintimacy? Quinton, this expert is Han\nNam Tien. He is your maternal\ngrandfather. Han Nam Tien continued,\n\"Your mother was a person of the ancient\nmartial world. When she was young, she\ndidn't like being controlled by the\nclan, so she ran away from home and\nthere was no news of her since then. A\nfew days ago, your cousin saw you at\nYinqui Lake. You look very much like\nyour mother, which is how I found you.\nHer eyes flickered slightly as she said\nsoftly. People of the ancient marshall\nworld, no one survived that day. He\nbowed his head slightly, slowly\nreplying, \"Figning death to escape is\nyour cousin's specialty. There is\nnothing shameful about it. After all,\nonly by surviving can one have a\nfuture.\" Pausing a moment, Han Nam Tien\nstood up, walked over to pat her\nshoulder, and said in a serious tone,\n\"You have suffered all these years, but\nI will take you back to the sect and\npersonally cultivate you. I won't let\nyou suffer anymore.\"\nThouen looking toward the two elders of\nthe Yan family. Father, grandfather,\nthis old master Yin looked at her with\neyes full of trust and spoke, \"Quinton,\nyour grandfather is an elder of the Kong\nsect. His ability, realm, and status are\nall higher than master trance. You go\nwith your grandfather, and we will be\nmore at ease. Yin Man Shuin beside him\nalso nodded and clapped in agreement.\nRight. Right. However, Yin Quinn Ton\nbluntly refused. I apologize,\ngrandfather, and I thank everyone for\nthe arrangement, but I want to maintain\nmy current life. You don't need to worry\nabout me. The two elders looked at her\nin surprise. Quinton made her attitude\nclear, shaking off his hand. Master Tran\nis very strong. I still have to learn\nfor a long time. It will be a while\nbefore I can graduate. Yen Quintin Tan\nsaid this out loud, but in her heart,\nshe thought of Tranmack. In this world,\nno one can compare to Transmac. Not to\nmention, he is my fiance\nfoolish. Master Tran is already the\nenemy of the entire ancient martial\nworld. Following him will only put you\nin danger. Yinqinton did not waver,\nrepeating the same phrase. Thank you for\nworrying about me, grandfather, but I am\nnot going. Hanam Tien was furious,\nforcing her, preposterous. My words,\nleave no room for your objection.\nObediently, come with me. Yin Quinton\nwas restrained and screamed in anger.\nI'm not going. Let go of me. Seeing\nthis, Yin Man Shuan only politely asked\nElder Han. Elder Han, this child Quinton\nhas been spoiled since childhood. It is\nbecause we were not strict in our\ndiscipline. Old Master Yin stroked his\nbeard and nodded. We will have to\ntrouble you in the future. Han Nam Tin\nnarrowed his eyes saying with deep\nmeaning, \"Rest assured, this is my\nbiological granddaughter. Even if I beat\nor scold her, there will be limits.\" On\nthe other side, after Cuck Trangier\nfinished recounting the event, he said,\n\"That is exactly how she was taken away\nby her grandfather.\" Tranmack turned\naround, nodding, understood. In his\nheart, he clearly understood the\nintentions of that old man named Han.\nThis Hanam Tien had set his sights on\nYin Quinton strength, which was why he\ntook her away. Then, Tranmac raised his\neyebrows, looking at Cuck Trong CA, and\nasked, \"You say Yin Quinton is at the\nKtonang sect?\" Hearing this, Cup Trouang\nCA immediately jumped up. What do you\nwant to do? That is the woman this young\nmaster has his eyes on. Don't you dare\nhave delusional thoughts. Otherwise,\nI'll teach you a lesson. Tranmack looked\nat him and gave a cold laugh. You can\nbarely save yourself. Yet you want to\nteach me a lesson. Hearing this, Cuck\nTrangi angrily argued. Although I can't\nbeat you, experts of my sect are as\ncommon as clouds. Stomping you to death\nwould be like stomping an ant. If you\nhave the guts, follow me back to the\nKong Tong sect. Whatever happens, you'll\nbe responsible for yourself. Hearing his\nanswer, Tramac narrowed his eyes and\nsmiled gently. That's great. Then lead\nthe way. Cut Trong CA blushed, opening\nhis mouth, but unable to speak. I I was\njust scaring you. Don't take it\nseriously. Cut Trurong CA found an\nexcuse, laughing awkwardly, \"Haha, I\nthink you're not bad. How about you\ndon't seek your own death? I'm leaving.\"\nTranmax stepped forward, patted his\nshoulder, and said with a smile full of\nmenace, \"Don't be in such a rush. Die\nhere or lead the way. Choose one.\"\nFinally, he still had to submit. Kak\nTruong CA brought Tranmack to a high\nmountain and said, \"This is the place.\"\nTranmac clased his hands behind his\nback, looking at the mountain and\nexclaiming, \"So the mountain gates of\nthe ancient marshall sex are all located\nwithin barriers.\" However, this type of\nbarrier is extremely complex and\nprofound. It is not something ordinary\nmartial artists can arrange. Could it be\nthat there were ancient immortal\ncultivators in the ancient martial\nworld? Cuck Trouang CA fished out a jade\npendant to enter. One can only use this\njade pendant to open the barrier.\nImmediately after a door appeared, he\nmade a welcoming gesture to tramac. All\nright, the two entered. Cuck truang ca\nskipped along like a child. Just go\nstraight ahead and we'll reach the kang\nsex mountain gate. But once we reach the\ngate, whether you can enter or not\ndepends on your ability. Kak Truong CA\nstood before a giant stone sword.\nEnthusiastically introducing enter\nKonang first bow to the mountain. Look\nat this stone sword. Isn't it majestic?\nWe have a rule. Before entering Kong,\none must pay respects to this stone\nsword. If Master Tran wants to enter the\nKong sect, you must bow to this mountain\nguarding stone. He knelt down and\nclasped his hands, glancing at Tranmack\nand signaling for him to follow suit.\nHowever, Tran Mack remained motionless,\nlooking at him with a determined gaze. I\nonly respect heaven and earth. Cuck\nTrong CA turned his head back, gave a\nthumbs up, and grinned doineeringly\nbefore I didn't want to bow either. And\nas a result, I was beaten by my father\nand locked up for 3 days. I had to\nobediently listen. Then he stood up,\nrubbed the back of his neck, and said,\n\"Master Tran, I'll go ahead then. If my\nfather sees I brought someone here,\nhe'll definitely beat me to death.\"\nTranmack didn't make things difficult\nfor him anymore and waved his hand. Go.\nAs soon as Cuck Truong CA left. A voice\nrang out behind Tranmack. To enter Kong\nTong, one must first bow to the\nmountain. Why do you not bow? Tranmack\nturned his head to look at the two men,\nsizing them up. Surprisingly, the ones\nguarding the mountain gate were two\ngrand masters of the peeping god realm.\nHearing this, the man frowned, staring\nstrictly at Tran Mack and questioning,\n\"Who are you? How dare you trespass on\nour Kong Tong sex mountain gate?\nTranmack replied without fear, I came to\nfind my disciple. Hearing Tranmax's\nwords, the two men couldn't help but\nsneer, what kind of thing are you to be\nworthy of having a disciple, spouting\nnonsense? How could our conton sect have\nyour disciple? Having said that, they\nboth threw their fists out at the same\ntime. Tranmack gently blocked them, then\neffortlessly knocked the two men away.\nDon't bother me. Suddenly, a round of\napplause rang out. Hanam Tien had\nappeared at some point followed by a\ngroup of sect disciples. He bowed\nslightly and said, \"Good skills.\"\nMeeting for the first time, I am the\nelder of Kong sect, Han Namtien. You\nmust be Master Tran. What business do\nyou have at our Kong Se? He narrowed his\neyes to assess this old man, sir named\nHan, then opened his mouth to speak. You\nmust be Yin Quinton's grandfather. You\nasked, despite knowing the answer, where\nis my disciple? Hearing a mention Yin\nQuinton, Malice immediately shot out\nfrom Han Namtien&lt;unk&gt;s eyes. Your\ndisciple that is my granddaughter is not\nfor an outsider like you to manage.\nWhether by reason or sentiment, you have\nno right to interfere. Now get lost.\nTranmax stood still and replied, \"No one\ncan force my disciple to do something\nshe doesn't want to. As long as she says\nwith her own mouth that she wants to\nstay here, I will leave immediately.\"\nHan Nam Tien patted his chest, speaking\nsternly. That is my granddaughter.\nWhether she agrees or not, she must\nlisten to me. After listening, Tramax\nsighed. Then don't blame me for being\ndiscourteous. Han Nam Tien immediately\nrushed forward. His gaze cold. Very\nwell. I was also wanted to compete with\nMaster Tran for a round. Seven kills\npalm. Tramac turned his hand and\nunleashed a move. Heaven Mystic divine\npalm. He looked in horror at Tranmax's\ncounterattack and in the next second he\nwas sent flying. Tranmack remained\nstanding in place, speaking in a deep\nvoice. With his palm, I already held\nback. Seeing this, the disciples behind,\nbuzzed with discussion. The great elder\nof the Kong Tong sect couldn't even\nwithstand one palm from Master Tran.\nThen who else can suppress Master Tran?\nI'm afraid only the sect leader can.\nTramac looked at Han Nam Tien, rubbed\nhis wrist, and the corner of his mouth\ncurled up. I'm a very reasonable person.\nEither you hand over Yin Quinton or I go\nin and find her. Just then, another\nperson appeared. The person spoke in a\nloud voice, \"Master Tranweight.\" Seeing\nthe arrival, the sect disciples\nimmediately felt reassured and began\npointing a Tranmack full of hostility.\n\"Sect leader, you finally come, sect\nleader, hurry and beat him until he's\nbetter off dead. Avenge the elder.\" The\nperson ignored the instigation around\nhim and smiled politely at Tramac. This\nhumble one is the sect leader of Kong\nTong sect, Cuck Thursday Lu. Pleased to\nmeet you, Cuck Thursday. Lu rub his\nhands, explaining gently. Master Tran,\nYinqinton is already an elder of my sect\nand has come into contact with important\nsecrets of the Kong sect. So, my Kong\nsect really cannot let her leave. On the\nside, Han Nam Tien, who had just been\nblown away, gritted his teeth and\nlowered his head, thinking to himself,\n\"Huh? She was locked up ever since I\nbrought her back. How could she know any\nsecrets of the Kong Tong sect? The sect\nleader clearly doesn't want to let Yin\nQuinn Ton go. Tranmack raised his\neyelids to look at him. Why say so many\nuseless words? Let's just fight. Hearing\nthis, Cuck Thursday, Lu maintained a\nrespectful attitude and suggested,\n\"Master Tran, let's go to a spacious\nplace to compete.\" Seeing Cuck Thursday\nleave, Tranmack snorted coldly and\nfollowed. Taking advantage of the\nopponents in attention, Tranmack closed\nin, threw a punch and said, \"To be\nhonest, I don't want to tangle with\nyou.\" Hearing this, Cuck Thursday lees,\nmouth curled up, and he also raised his\nfist. Fine then. Thus, the two began to\nexchange blows, sparks flying\neverywhere. Tranmack observed while\nfighting. His strength is roughly the\nthird break of the divine realm, the\nspirit breaker stage. On Cuck Thursday\nLee's side, he was also assessing\nTranmack. He can actually fight me\nhead-on. Indeed, he cannot be\nunderestimated. The two fought fiercely\nin the air for a while, finally landing\non an open clearing. Tranmack unleashed\na killing move. All right, let's end\nthis. Cuck Thursday. Lun narrowed his\neyes. Luckily, I prepared early\notherwise I would really have been\ndefeated by you. Then he also began to\ngather energy. Ah, Tranac was slightly\nstunned looking at him and thinking,\n\"The strength of the spirit breaker\nrealm is indeed extraordinary. He can\nactually seize the heaven and earth\nspiritual energy from my control. But\nimmediately he decisively rushed\nforward. Come on. Cuck Thursday. Li\nwatched the incoming attack, gritted his\nteeth, and unleashed his killing move.\nSeven kills return to one. The two moves\ncollided, causing a violent explosion.\nCuck Thursday. Luke clutched his chest.\nMaster Tran, indeed, your reputation is\nwelld deserved. Tranax said coldly. Cut\nthe crap. My patience is limited.\nAlthough defeated, he still persisted\nwith his original stance. Master Tran, I\nadmit your strength is very powerful.\nBut Yin Quinton cannot leave. Tranmax\nsmirked, but the smile was bone\nchillingly cold. You are forcing me to\ndestroy the Kong Tong sect. Cuck\nThursday Lenoed his eyes. You can try.\nSeeing him so confident, Tranmack\nimmediately took out a magical artifact.\nI know your calculations. You know that\neven if you can't beat me, you can use\nthe sect guardian grand formation of the\nKong sect to suppress me. Then I will\nbreak this formation and see what you\nhave left to rely on. He laughed coldly,\nretreating backward. Nonsense. My\nKtonang sect sect guardian grand\nformation has already opened. Master\nTran, the Grand Formation is gathering\nspiritual energy. If you give up now and\nflee, there's still time to save your\nlife. Otherwise, there is only death. A\ngiant hand appeared in the sky, pressing\ndown toward Trramac. Tranmack held his\nlong sword, provoking. Is that so? Then\nI have to see for myself. The moment the\nhand pressed down, Tranmack also\nlaunched a move. Great down nine swords.\nHeaven breaker. The sect guardian grand\nformation was hit by Tranmax sword,\nemitting a loud explosion. Boom. That\ngiant hand had blocked the attack.\nAh, Master Tran, you lost. How can my\nconton sex sect guardian grand formation\nbe something you can break? Cuck\nThursday low however fell into silence\nthinking to himself something's wrong.\nThe power of the grand formation is\ngradually dissipating just as everyone\nwas cheering for victory with a ripping\nsound. Their formation was torn open.\nThe watching crowd was all terrified.\nImpossible. How did he pierce through?\nThe sect guardian grand formation is\nuseless against him. Tramac glanced at\nCuck Thursday low. Are you convinced\nnow? Hurry up and hand over my disciple.\nHe sighed dejectedly. Sigh. Great elder,\nyou go make the trip. Hanam tien was\nalso helpless. Turning to leave. Fine. I\nadmit defeat. Not long after. Yen\nQuinton was brought over. With tears in\nher eyes, she looked at Tranmac. Master\ndisciple pays respects to master.\nTranmac stopped in front of her speaking\nsoftly. Whether you want to stay or come\nwith me, it's your choice. No one can\nstop you. Yinquint nodded and smiled.\nYes. She turned her head to look at Han\nNam Tien, opening her mouth slightly.\nGrandfather, I'm sorry. Han Nam Tan\nstroked his beard and sighed. It is good\nenough that you still acknowledge this\ngrandfather. Go. She bid farewell to the\ntwo men, then walked quickly to Tranmack\nside. After leaving the mountain gate,\nshe curiously asked Tranac, \"Master, you\nare not from the Kong sect. How did you\nfind a mountain gate?\" Tranmac lowered\nhis head in thought. It's a long story.\nSuddenly, he shielded Yin Quinton,\nsignaling her to stop. There's danger.\nAs soon as he finished speaking, a group\nof assassins appeared, surrounding\nTranmac and Yin Quinton. Tranmax\nsmirked. It's the ancient marshall world\nagain. How enthusiastic, sending so many\nexperts to greet me. Immediately after,\nan elder appeared. It was Elder 2 of the\nVos sect. Elder 2 signaled the\ndisciples. He just came out of the Kong\nsect. His stamina is definitely\ndepleted. Don't give him time to\nrecover. Attack quickly. Tranmack winked\nat Yin Quinton. Their target is me. You\ngo first. Stay safe. Tranmack drew his\nmagic treasure quickly knocking down a\ngroup of Vos son sect disciples. The\nsword energy is too strong. We can't get\nclose to him at all. What should we do,\nElder? They were a bit panicked. That\nperson hurriedly called for help from\nElder Duong. Brother Duong. Master Tran\nis too strong. If this continues. This\nwas Elder Duong of the Q Hois sect.\nElder Duong was also a bit worried and\nmade up his mind. We can only do that.\nImmediately, the subordinate assassins\ngathered together. Huh? Nine Heavens\nGrand Formation. Activate. Tranmack\nfrowned. It's the Nine Heavens Star\nGrand Formation again. Instantly, the\nthree of them manifested a giant blade,\nslashing down upon command. Slash. Tran\nMack gritted his teeth to defend Ugg. I\nconsumed too much energy earlier. Taking\nadvantage of Tranmack, revealing an\nopening. A woman holding a short blade\nrushed out from the forest. Finally\nwaited for it. This is the moment she\nraised the blade and shouted, \"Go to\nhell.\" While Tramac was busy dealing\nwith the people of the ancient marshall\nworld. A mysterious figure in black\nappeared behind him. As soon as Tramac\nreacted and turned his head, he was\nstabbed by her blade. \"Break for me!\" he\ncried out in pain, secretly alarmed at\nhis heart. The people of the ancient\nmarshall world also seized the\nopportunity. Elder Duong shouted, \"Look\nquickly. Master Tran has been ambushed.\nUse full power.\" Following the order,\nthe nine heaven spirit god slashed down\nagain. Tranmack pushed the woman away.\nGet lost. His eyes trembled and he\ngritted his teeth. Damn it. Tran Mack\ndidn't have time to dodge, crying out in\npain. Ark. Seeing this, the people of\nthe ancient marshall world couldn't hide\ntheir joy and laughed loudly. Huh.\nMaster Tran took a direct hit. Everyone\nattacked together. Kill him.\nImmediately, the assassins responded and\ncharged. Take this chance. Take his\nlife. The female assassin pursed her\nlips. If he's done for, those people can\nfinish him. But if he still has help,\nbut right at this moment, Tranax stood\nup again, unleashing a strike to block\nthem. Seeing this, everyone was\nterrified. What is happening? He stood\nup again. Why do I feel like he's become\nmore terrifying? My body and soul are\nboth trembling. Tranmack raised his hand\nto gather power and unleash a strike,\nattacking with eyes cold to the bone.\nEveryone was horrified. What is he\nplanning to do? I can't move. My body\nfeels very wrong. Miserable screams rang\nout from the crowd. Ah, my body.\nImmediately after, the assassins turned\ninto dust. The woman shouted in horror.\nSomething's wrong. She stood behind the\ngroup of assassins. They were begging,\n\"Master Tran, spare our lives.\" This\nwoman's face was pale, thinking to\nherself, I can't move either. If I don't\nleave now, I'll turn into dust, too. I\ncan only use that. Immediately, she\ntakes out a bead, commanding, \"Second\nsoul bead. Take me away.\" Tramac\nfinishes dealing with the crowd. Looks\nin that direction, but she has\ndisappeared. She actually possesses a\nsecond soul bead. What is her background\nexactly? Tramac rubs his head, muttering\nto himself, not thinking about this\nanymore. The consumption this time was\ntoo great. I must find some treasures to\nreplenish my vitality. Half a month\nlater, Tranmack returns to Yen Qui Lake\nfor secluded cultivation. The ancient\nmarshall world seems to have been beaten\ninto fear. Or perhaps it is the calm\nbefore the storm, leaving only a\nterrifying silence. Yen Quinton sees\nTramac enter and says respectfully,\n\"Master, you have left seclusion.\"\nTramac steps forward and asks\nimmediately, \"Has everything been fine\nduring this time?\" Yen Quinton\nimmediately reports the situation. Your\nfriends are all safe and sound, and the\nMax sect is operating normally. Only Mr.\nMock from the Medicine King Valley is\ntemporarily staying outside Yen Qui\nLake, waiting for you to leave seclusion\nto discuss something. Tranmack walks to\nthe sofa and slowly sits down. What does\nValley Master Mockshin Fong want with\nme? Opposite him is Machchin Fong who\nspeaks solemnly. Grandmaster Tran,\nplease represent our medicine king\nvalley in the central prefecture pill\nrefining exchange conference for many\nyears. My mock family has managed the\nmedicine king valley and been admired by\nthe world. But the pill sex co- family\nof the ancient Marshall world has\nopposed my mock family for hundreds of\nyears. Initially, our two families were\nevenly matched, but gradually the\ntalents of the medicine king valley\nbecame fewer and fewer. It wasn't until\n5 years ago that a peerless genius\nappeared in our medicine king valley\ncalled the princess deep to to buy the\npill refining world. Hearing this,\nTranmack frowns in thought. A genius?\nI'm afraid that's not a good thing.\nOtherwise, when I destroyed the medicine\nking valley before, why didn't I see\nthis genius? He places a book on the\ntable, then strokes his beard, speaking\ncalmly. In the previous pill refining\nexchange, the pill sect secretly seduced\ndeep to two. She chose to betray us,\nstealing our medicine king valley's\ntreasure, the medicine king grand\ncannon, and submitting to the pill sect.\nNow the trienal pill refining exchange\nhas begun again. I implore you to step\nforward and reclaim the medicine king\ngrand cannon for us. A glint of interest\nflashes in Trramax's eyes, and the\ncorners of his mouth curl up. All right,\nI agree. Inside, he calculates. After\nall, the medicine King Valley's\nbelongings are now my Max Sex\nbelongings. Even if I don't need them,\nit's not for others to touch. A few days\nlater, they appear at the entrance of\nDan Fong Manor. Tranmack pauses,\nspeaking up. There are spiritual energy\nfluctuations here. Hearing this, Machin\nFong affirms, you are correct. This is a\nfireguiding basin. Only a pill refiner\nusing true fire stimulated by trueqruq\nchi can light it up to open the door.\nLet me after saying that he uses\nspiritual power to blow up the flames\nand the door slowly opens. Machin fong\nleads the way. Let's go. Stepping into\nthe main hall, he begins to introduce it\nto Tramac. This exchange conference is\nalso the largest trading fair for pill\nrefiners. We can look around first. The\nexchange conference officially starts\ntomorrow. Tranmack frowns slightly,\nsensing silently. He doesn't need to\nlook closely, just releasing his\nspiritual sense to feel the energy\nfluctuations is enough. Mockchin Fong\nfollows behind, looking around, and\nsuddenly speaks up. The items over there\nseem not bad. Tramax footsteps pause. A\nman with a face full of smiles invites\nthem, \"Come see my supreme quality\njinseng.\" Tramax sees several blood\njinsenings, thinking to himself, \"It's\nblood jinseng. one of the important\ningredients for refining the heavenly\npill. It can make up for my depleted\nvital essence. Tramac walks straight\nover and asks the stall owner, \"How old\nare these jinsengs?\" The person replies,\n\"The one on the left is 100 years old.\nThe one on the right is over 200 years\nold, and the one in the middle is 500\nyears old.\" Hearing this, Tran Mack\nasks, \"How much for the 200-year-old\none?\" Machin Fong Hurly explains,\n\"Grandmaster Tran, they don't sell here,\nonly trade.\" As soon as the words fall,\nTranmack directly takes out a pill and\nhands it over. Exchange it for this\nsupreme quality pill. Is that okay? The\ntwo men are stunned upon seeing this.\nMachchin Fong can't help but complain.\nOh my grandmaster Tran, is there anyone\nwho trades like you? Even if he gave you\nthis whole pile of Jinseng, you'd still\nbe making a huge loss. Tranmack raises\nhis eyebrows, looking at him and\nreplying calmly, \"It doesn't matter.\nThis spiritual medicine is useless to\nme. It's better to exchange it for\nthis.\" He stuffs the pill into the stall\nowner's hand. The man smiles from ear to\near. Please choose freely. Choose\nfreely. In his heart, he thinks, \"I've\nmet a prodigal son. I've struck it\nrich.\" Observing for a moment, Tranmax\nsays, \"Then I'll take these few\n200-year-old ones.\" Just then, a young\nman reaches out to stop him. \"Wait,\nboss. I want this whole pile of\njinseng.\" The stall owner explains to\nhim with some apprehension. \"Young\nMaster Co., these 200-year-old Jinsengs\nhave already been sold. You are a step\ntoo late. Colam glances at Tranmack, his\neyes full of contempt. Sold to him? What\ndid he use to exchange? I'll pay double.\nTramac frowns, looking at the guy with\nextreme dissatisfaction, thinking, \"It\nseems this guy also knows the blood\njinseng is extraordinary.\" The stall\nowner takes out the pill from earlier\nand says, \"Young Master Co., it's not\nthat I'm not giving you face, but this\ncustomer exchanged this supreme quality\nspiritual pill with me. Don't talk about\ndouble. If you can give me one like\nthis, I'll sell to you. Seeing this,\nColam immediately freezes. The next\nsecond, a glint of shock flashes in his\neyes. Supreme quality spiritual pill. He\nclenches his fists, glancing at\nTranmack. Kid, what is your background?\nTranmack lazily lifts his eyelids,\nreplying, \"What the hell does it have to\ndo with you? Get lost.\" Seeing Tranmax's\nattitude, Colam pats his chest and\nintroduces himself. Is it your first\ntime here not knowing who I am? I am a\nyoung master of the pills sect. Colam, I\nmust have these jinsenings. Tramac\nfrowns and complains. Annoying is death.\nGet lost. Just then, a girl calls out\nloudly from afar. Ah, here you are. She\nwalks to Co Lamb's side, asking softly,\n\"Young master, what happened?\" Co Lamb\nlifts the girl's face, sneering,\nnothing. Just met someone who doesn't\nknow how to live or die. Daring to fight\nfor my things. Hearing this, the girl\nalso looks at Tranmack and raises her\neyebrows. who dares to fight for the\nthings the young master has set his eyes\non. Hearing this, Machin Fong shouts\nsternly, \"Deep to do, deep to decease\nhim,\" and speaks arrogantly, \"I wonder\nwho it was. Turns out it's Marshall\nUncle Mock. So, you are people from the\nmedicine king valley.\" Colam adds, \"Just\na bunch of failures who couldn't keep a\ngenius. I advise you to be sensible and\nget far away.\" The two of them sing in\nharmony, exchanging words back and\nforth. Over here, Tranmack is trying to\nsuppress his anger, pondering, \"I really\nwant to slap this guy in a meat paste\nwith one palm. But if I reveal my\nidentity and strength now, the pill sect\nprobably won't bet with me and won't\ngive me the chance to win the medicine\nking Grand Cannon. If I can only use my\nown essence power, which hasn't been\nreplenished yet, it will be consumed\nagain. It's really a dilemma.\" Right at\nthis tense moment, another girl walks\nover, breaking the atmosphere. No way.\nNo way. Clearly, someone else has\nfinished buying the items, yet the pill\nseck young master wants to rob them.\nTramac looks at the girl with some\nconfusion. I don't know you. Why are you\ninterfering in my business? She glares,\npretending to be angry. You're too\nblunt. Then she pats her chest, smiling\nand introducing herself. My name is John\nNoyekio. We can consider ourselves\nacquainted now, right? Tramack nods\nseriously without hesitation. Okay, John\nNoyekio, I know you now. On this side,\nKolam looks at Jong Noyek Kio, drool\nalmost dripping down. So cute. Then he\nsteps forward, revealing a smile he\nthinks can charm thousands of young\ngirls. May I ask which family's daughter\nMiss Jong is? Why did you come to\nparticipate in the alchemist exchange\nalone? Hearing this, Jang Noyet Kio\nfrowns somewhat impatient. You bastard\nfrom the pill sect. Do you also\nmoonlight as a census taker? Colam\ngrinds his teeth in anger. you deep to\nthe takes the opportunity to step\nforward and comfort him. Young Master\nCo, give Miss Jong some face. Others\nalso say, \"How could the young master\nnot know how to cherish jade and pity\nfragrance?\" Colam immediately nods\nrepeatedly, laughing awkwardly. Haha.\nAll right. For Miss Jong's sake, I'll\nyield these jinsengs to you. You be\ncareful in the future. After speaking,\nhe turns around and leaves with deep\ntatu, waving his sleeves. Tramac looks\nat their retreating figures, falling\ninto deep thought. John Noyette Kio\nsuddenly walks over and pats his\nshoulder. All right, you don't need to\nthank me. I just despise the pill sec\nfor bullying people with their power.\nTramac replies calmly. I didn't say I\nwanted to thank you either. She smiles,\nwaving her hand and instructing him.\nHaha, it's fine. Stay away from that co\nlamb guy in the future. He will\ndefinitely seek revenge. Machin Fong who\nhad been silent until now speaks up.\nThis little girl's strength is not bad.\nTranmack agrees. To be at the body\nprotection grandmaster realm at such a\nyoung age, she must have some background\nbehind her. Tranmack puts his hands on\nhis hips, turning back to look at the\nstall owner, thinking, \"Whatever. Ignore\nher. Let's get the things and move on.\nNext, exchange for a few more rare\nmedicinal ingredients.\" Gathering enough\nfor two plants can also refine the\nheavenly pill to repair a portion of the\nconsumed essence. The next day, waves of\ncheers resound from the stands. Long\nlive the pill sect. The pill refining\nworld is everlasting. On the stage, the\nhost of the exchange, pills sec master,\nsmiles and greets. Today is the trienal\ngrand gathering of the pill refining\nworld. We welcome everyone who has come.\nBelow the stage, Machin Fong sees\nCoyha's appearance and immediately says\nunhappily, this guy named Co is truly\nshameless. The exchange conference was\noriginally a gathering for the pill\nrefining world, but now he acts as if\nit's his own solitary gathering. A\ncommand rings out. Now I declare the\n37th exchange conference officially\nbegins. According to the old rules,\nstart by passing three trials. First\ntrial, fire appreciation. Following the\nannouncement, medicine cauldrons are\ncarried up one by one. Machin Fong\nexplains to Tramac from the side to\nchallenge the pill sect. One must pass\nthree trials. This first trial is to use\ntrue fire tempered from trueqi to fill\nthis medicine cauldron made of special\nmaterial. Compared to ordinary medicine\ncauldrons, it requires double the\ncultivation consumption. Anyone can\nchallenge failure means elimination.\nTramac understands and says firmly,\n\"Okay, you said it very clearly. Let's\ngo up.\" Machchin Fong also responds\nexcitedly, \"Okay.\" The two immediately\nappear on the competition stage.\nTranmack looks at the medicine cauldron\nin front of him, thinking, \"This\ncauldron has no mystery. It's just she\ntransforming into fire.\" Immediately\nafter, a raging fire blazes up.\nMachinong sees this and is shocked.\nYou're too fast. Everyone else is still\npreparing to channel their chi. Tranmac\nputs on an expression that couldn't be\nmore serious. Looks at him solemnly and\nreplies, \"A man cannot be told he is\nfast.\" Above Koiha is naturally\nobserving the contestants movements\nclosely. He exclaims, \"How is that\npossible?\" The other judges also slam\nthe table and stand up. Unbelieving\nchatter buzzes. Why is this kid so fast?\nWhose family's genius is this? Even the\npill sect master wouldn't be this fast,\nright? Just luck. Let's watch a bit\nmore. Koyeta adjusts his posture and\nsolemnly announces 36 people have passed\nthe first trial. Coyet ha. Now the\nsecond trial begins. Herb\nidentification. A huge medicine cabinet\nis carried out. Mockchin Fong explains\nagain. The second trial is to identify\nthese medicinal ingredients. Write their\nnames and effects on paper and submit\nit. Identifying just 10 types is\nconsidered passing. Don't think 10 types\nis easy. These ingredients are both rare\nand strange, not commonly seen items. A\nwooden board appears in their hands.\nMockchin Fong adds, \"Just write your\nanswers on this board and submit it.\"\nTranmac has already started writing and\ndrawing. Tranmac silently looks at the\nmedicinal ingredients, then at the\nwhiteboard. The judges up above start\nwhispering again. \"Is the second trial\nthis year a bit too hard? Were these\nthings collected from? They are all\npeculiar ingredients. Even I don't\nrecognize all of them.\" Seeing their\nlively discussion, Coyette Ha steps\nforward to explain. In previous years,\nthose who passed the three trials were a\nmixed bag. This year, I intentionally\nraised the difficulty. Those who can\nmake it to the end will definitely be\npeople of true strength. Hearing this,\nthe two elders behind him, leaning close\nand whisper, \"Oh, sounds nice, but I\nthink he's just afraid someone will\nissue a challenge.\" Machin Fong looks at\nthe ingredients in the cabinet, feeling\na bit dejected. Even though I've\npracticed hard all my life and claimed\nto have tasted hundreds of herbs,\nlooking at these things, they seem\ncompletely alien. He hesitates, unable\nto decide. Suddenly, he hears Trram's\nvoice. Hey, I'm done writing. Mockchin\nFong stares blankly at Tramac. The\nelders on the stand see Tran's action\nand think he's giving up, so they start\njudging. See, passing the first trial\nwas just his luck. The second trial just\nstarted and he's already given up. Why\ndid he submit so fast? He definitely\njust scribbled nonsense. To the side,\nColam also sees Tranmack. He grits his\nteeth looking at him. It's that kid.\nDeep tutu follows behind her eyes\nlooking at Tranmack full of contempt and\nsays, \"Young Master Co., do we need to\nremind the semaster? This guy is\nprobably here to seek revenge for\nMedicine King Valley.\" The corner of his\nmouth lifts into a meaningful smile as\nhe replies, \"No need.\" To seek revenge,\none must have the strength. like that\ntrash medicine King Valley. Anyone from\nour pill sect could easily handle them.\nThe judge looks at the answers on the\nboard. Stunned. You wrote a full 10\ntypes. In his heart, he thinks besides\nwhether he wrote them correctly or not,\nI don't even know. Koiata waves to that\njudge and says, \"Bring the answers to\nme.\" I invite the judges to appraise\nwith me. Whether this person's answers\nare correct or not. The elders\nimmediately gather around to check the\nanswers. First is yellow heaven grass.\nHm. The medicinal properties are also\ncorrect. The second one is also correct.\nI know this one. He answered right.\nConoy at high. Shocked. All correct. Not\na single mistake. He sits up straight in\nhis seat. Looking at Tranmac with eyes\nfull of appreciation and expectation. A\ngenius. Let's see how he passes the\nthird trial. On this side, Machin Fong\nalso holds up his whiteboard, asking\ncautiously. This should barely be enough\nto pass, right? Very quickly, the final\ntrial arrives. A solemn announcement\nrings out. Those who pass the second\ntrial, please prepare for the third\ntrial, fire control. Mockchin Fong\nstarts explaining to Tramac again. The\nthird trial is to control the flame\naccording to the command flags on the\nstage. Red flag is high fire. Black flag\nis low fire. If your reaction is slower\nthan 3 seconds, eliminated. Coyha's\nvoice rings out as he raises two flags\nin his hands. Third trial, fire control.\nTake the command flags as the signal.\nBegin. Mockchin Fong calmly instructs.\nJust like this. Use your hands to\nembrace the cauldron. Be ready to listen\nto commands at any time. The commands\nare issued immediately. Red flag.\nTranmack embraces the cauldron and a red\nflame rises. The commands change in\nsuccession. Black flag. Red flag. Black\nflag. At this moment, quite a few people\non the competition ground start to lose\ntheir rhythm, lamenting, I'm done for.\nor I was a beat too slow. Me too. Seeing\nthis, Tranmac understands a little.\nAlthough on the surface it tests\nreaction, in reality it tests the\ncultivation base of the pill refiner.\nThe more energy consumed, the slower the\nreaction and you get eliminated. Machin\nFong wipes the sweat from his forehead\nand whispers, \"The third trial is over.\"\nTramac, now you can go on stage to\nchallenge the host. If you win, you can\nreplace them to become the host to the\nnext exchange conference and also\nreceive some rewards. Tranmack hears\nthis and replies, \"My goal is only to\ntake back the medicine king Grand\nCannon. Will Koyeta accept this bet?\"\nMachin Fong turns his head sharply to\nlook at him, his tone firm. He has to\naccept, otherwise the honor of the pill\nsect will be gone. Tramac nods firmly\nand says, \"All right.\" Coyha sees only\ntwo people left on the competition\nground. So he asks, \"Little junior\nbrother, do you want to issue a\nchallenge?\" The judge is behind me. Who\ndo you want to challenge? Tramac answers\nwithout hesitation. The person I want to\nchallenge is you, Koiha. A judge sitting\nabove hears this and cannot help but\nfeel dissatisfied. Koyeta's strength is\nrecognized as number one in the entire\npill refining world. He is truly\narrogant. Conha, however, does not show\ntoo much emotion. He clears his throat.\nLittle brother, I am the pill sect\nmaster. K Noyata, are you sure you want\nto challenge me? Tramack nods firmly.\nThat's right. Furthermore, I also want\nyou to bet the medicine king Grand\nCannon. Coyadha replies directly. Fine,\nI can accept the challenge, but if I\nwin, what will you give me? Tramac takes\nout a glowing pill and offers it. I will\nuse the method to refine this pill as\nthe wager. What do you think? Koiha is\nso shocked his mouth hangs open,\nthinking to himself, this pill at a\nglance is clearly no ordinary item. It\nis much more powerful than that medicine\nking Grand Cannon. But Kam appearing\nfrom who knows where rushes in front of\nCoyha to block him. Wait, my father is\nof noble status. Not just anyone can\nchallenge him. Then Kolam turns his head\nand whispers, \"Father, this kid is a bit\npeculiar. Let me fight around with him\nfirst to probe his true abilities. It\nwon't be too late for you to bet with\nhim afterward.\" Koihan nods slightly and\nreplies, \"I understand.\" Kolam looks\nback at Tramac, his eyes full of\ncontempt. You must pass my trial first\nto be qualified to challenge my father.\nMachin Fong, standing nearby, hears this\nand can't help clenching his fists,\nsaying indignantly, \"The rule is that\nthose who pass the three trials can\nfreely choose a judge or host to\nchallenge.\" \"Why is it changed now that\nit's the pill's sex turn?\" Colam raises\nhis eyebrows provocatively and says, \"If\nhe can't even beat me, what need is\nthere to bother my father to act?\"\nTramax sees old Mockabout to speak up.\nSo, he stops him. He laughs coldly.\n\"Fine, stop arguing. Let's just listen\nto them. Let's start now.\" The two\nimmediately step onto the competition\nstage to face each other. The crowd of\nonlookers cannot help but feel some\nanticipation. For so many years, this is\nthe first time someone has challenged\nthe pill sec. I don't think this person\ncan do it. Passing three trials is one\nthing. Pill refining is another. That's\nright. Cole Lamb is the young master of\nthe pill sect. His strength is\nextraordinary.\nSmiling as she strikes up a\nconversation. Marshall uncle, since when\ndid you take in such a formidable\ndisciple? He frowns and glances at her,\nhis eyes sharp. Deep to it. Don't dream\nof getting a word out of me.\nFurthermore, there will come a day when\nyou will regret everything you have\ndone. The rule announcement rings out\nagain. The topic is the heistasis pill.\nTime limit is half an hour. Prepare your\nown furnace. Ingredients provided by the\nconference. Whoever refineses a spirit\npill of higher quality and better effect\nwins. Colam is naturally triumphant. He\nsmiles cunningly thinking, \"I have\nrefined this heistasis pill countless\ntimes. I can skillfully refine a\nhigh-grade one. Moreover, I have this\ngood item to help.\" He immediately pulls\nout an object, staring at Tranmack with\nprovocative eyes. The crowd below the\nstage erupts in commotion. Look quickly\nat what young Master Co Lamb took out.\nIt's a fire cloud purple dragon furnace.\nThat's a divine artifact. He hugs the\ndivine artifact, saying, \"Kid, where's\nyour furnace? Don't tell me you don't\nhave one.\" Tramac looks at him with a\nrippleless gaze and smiles. A true pill\nrefiner has no need for a furnace.\nDrawing upon the sun, moon, and stars, I\nrefine the pill. As a steady voice\nfalls, the ingredients on the table\nsimultaneously fly into the air, fusing\ntogether, transforming into a pill.\nEveryone is once again stunned into\nsilence. Oh my god, what am I seeing?\nVoid pill refining? Is this magic? How'd\nhe do that? He He succeeded. No\nimpulsive. This is completely beyond the\ncommon knowledge of the pill refining\nworld. Seeing this koiha eyes bulging,\ngrits his teeth, thinking unwillingly.\nI've only heard of this technique. Never\nseen it with my own eyes. The pill he\nrefined must be fake. On this side,\nMachin Fong laughs triumphantly. Ah,\nfrom ancient times to now in the pill\nrefining world, only you alone can do\nthis. It seems the history of pill\nrefining must be rewritten. Deep 22 also\ncannot help being shocked thinking\nmedicine king valley basically doesn't\nhave this kind of divine skill. Could it\nbe that when they taught me before they\nhid this kind of divine skill? Seeing\nthe series of events, Co Lamb shouts,\n\"How is this possible?\" At the same\ntime, an announcement also rings out.\nCoam was distracted while transmitting\ntrue energy. Pill refining failed.\nSeeing his incompetent son is beyond\nsaving. Coneta casts a suspicious look.\nKid, I suspect the authenticity of this\npill. I demand an inspection. Tranmack\npushes the pill over, replying readily,\n\"As you wish.\" The father and son of the\nco- family, upon seeing that pill,\nimmediately have their eyes light up.\nCoam speaks first. \"Father, this thing\nlooks like a supreme quality item, no\nmatter how you look at it.\" He grits his\nteeth, still unwilling to accept the\ntruth, pulls out a knife, and viciously\nslashes a line on his own hand. I don't\nbelieve it. How can someone refine a\nSupreme quality spirit pill in such a\nshort time? I must personally test the\neffect of this pill. Coyette ha presses\nthe pill onto the wound. The wound\nimmediately closes up, leaving not a\nsingle trace. The people on the judge's\nseats are directly stunned, clamoring to\ncome forward and observe. Oh my god, the\nheistasis pills fragrance spreads\neverywhere. This is no longer just\nsupreme quality. It is legendary grade.\nI have never seen such a pill. Colam\nlooks at the pill in his hand with a\ndark face. Why is it like this? How is\nit possible? The result is set. A clear\nannouncement rings out. Medicine King\nValley's Tranmac challenge successful.\nTranmac is not in a hurry. He looks at\nCoyha and says, \"It's your turn.\" Coyha\nlooks at him seriously, speaking in the\ntone of an elder. Although you defeated\nmy son, you may not necessarily defeat\nmy pill sect. I want to show you what\ntrue pill refining arts are. K Noyeta\nimmediately takes Collam's place and\nsits down. The crowd started buzzing\nagain preparing to watch a good show. He\ncould refine a legendary grade spirit\nmedicine. It seemed he really could\nshake the pill sect. That's right. No\nmatter what is said, being able to force\nCon Noya to personally take action, he\nwas already extremely excellent. Coming\nto this exchange conference was truly\nworth it. The previous round was won by\nmedicine king valley. So this time,\nKoyet Ha could choose the pill refining\ntopic. Amidst the noisy discussion,\nCoyet Ha's voice rang out. Divine\nability pill. Those judges heard this\nand were greatly shocked. Sect Master\nCo. You can refine the divine ability\npill. Divine ability realm level. That\nis a spirit medicine that only divine\nrealm powerhouses can refine. Does this\nmean sect master co has already stepped\ninto the divine realm? deep to the\nglanced at Machin Fong sneering.\nMarshall uncle, are you scared? Are you\npanicked? He still maintained a\ndissatisfied attitude towards her,\nreplying coldly. Cut the sarcasm. Open\nyour eyes wide and watch clearly in his\nheart. However, he was already panicked,\nanxious, and uneasy. Grandmaster TR, you\ncan do it, right? You should be able to\ndo it, right? You definitely can do it.\nCo Noeta saw Tran Mack hesitating and\nnot speaking, so he warned again. Kid,\nif you don't have divine realm strength,\nyou won't be able to refine the divine\nability pill. He was calculating in his\nheart. Although the probability of me\nsuccessfully refining the divine ability\npill is only 10%. As long as I can force\nhim to give up, I win. The corners of\nTran Mac's mouth lifted before absolute\nstrength. All conspiracies and schemes\nare just empty talk. It's just a divine\nability pill. Tran Mack immediately\nslapped the table. The medicinal herbs\nflew up, spinning in his palm. Tranmax\nsaid with overflowing confidence in the\nblink of an eye, \"A pill can be\nrefined.\" The judges naturally saw\neverything happening before their eyes.\nEveryone stared with wide eyes and open\nmouths, their pupils dilating with a\nwave of the hand. It was refined,\nmiraculous. What kind of move is this\nexactly? Too formidable. It's a miracle.\nA miracle. To be able to live to this\nday, to witness this scene with my own\neyes is truly my blessing. They\ncowtowing and shouting loudly. Divine\nMaster descended to the world. Divine\nMaster descended to the world. Machchin\nFong was even more ecstatic. He also\nknelt down and shouted, \"Divine Master\ndescended to the world.\" Deep to looked\nat Tramac being woripped by everyone on\nthe competition stage. Jealous to no\nend. Medicine King Valley actually has\nthis kind of method. Why didn't they\nteach me back then? I hate you all. Jean\nNoyette Kio was also present. She puffed\nher cheeks angrily, glaring and\nmuttering to herself. Bastard. Clearly,\nhe's so formidable himself. Yet, he\nhides it, causing this young lady to\nhave to help him out of a predicament.\nNext time I see you, this young lady\nwill definitely teach you a lesson.\nTranmack looked towards the host. Can\nthe result be announced now? That person\nheard this, was stunned for a moment,\nand hurriedly replied, \"Yes, of course.\"\nThen he turned his head to whisper to\nKyha, \"Smaster Co., it has been\ninspected. It is. It is the divine\nability pill. That is a pill that only\nthe divine realm can refine. How could\nhe refine it with just a casual wave of\nhis hand?\" Coonet would not accept\nlosing face like this. His eyes rolled\nand he said, \"Bring the pill here for\nfairness. The person testing the\nmedicine this time will be appointed by\nme.\" That person immediately\nrespectfully brought the pill over\nsaying, \"Yes, the pill is here. Who do\nyou want to point?\" He looked at\nTranmack in deep thought. \"If this\nspirit medicine is real, wouldn't it be\na bargain for the person testing the\nmedicine?\" Konoha immediately turned\naround and shouted, \"Elder Kai, you are\na prying divine realm Grandmaster. Come\nand test if this pill is real or fake.\"\nElder Kai, being called by name, was\nslightly stunned, but very quickly\nreplied, \"All right.\" He took the pill\nin his hand, swallowed it in one gulp,\nand immediately sat down to cultivate.\nNot long after, Elder Kai opened his\neyes, and laughed loudly. Haha.\nUnexpectedly, at my age, I have finally\nstepped into the divine realm. He\nstepped forward without hesitation,\nbowing respectfully. The sect master's\ngreat kindness and virtue I will never\nforget in this life. Seeing this,\nTranmac was a bit dissatisfied. This\npill seems to have been refined by me,\nright? Elder Kai heard this, frowned,\nand said indifferently, \"But if the sect\nmaster hadn't asked me to test the\nmedicine, this pill wouldn't have\nreached my hands.\" \"So, the person I\nshould thank the most is the\nsectmaster.\" Tranmack glanced at the\nhost. \"Is the authenticity determined\nnow?\" \"That person smiled awkwardly,\nreplying carefully.\" \"Determined. You\nwon.\" Tranmack nodded slightly, his gaze\nturning cold as he shifted to Elder Kai.\n\"Since the inspection is done, then spit\nthe pill out and return it to me.\" Elder\nKai heard this. His whole body\nstiffened. What? He immediately started\nlaughing loudly, saying, \"Stupid. I\nalready ate it.\" And my realm has\nincreased. How can I spit it out? But\nTranmack just gently raised his hand,\nusing a force to pull him in front of\nhimself, saying, \"I told you to spit it\nout, so you must spit it out.\" The next\nsecond, the top of Elder Kai's head was\npressed against Tranmax's palm. He asked\nin panic, \"Kid, what do you want to do?\"\nTranmack absorbed the true energy in his\nbody while shouting sternly, \"Spit it\nout for me.\" Elder Kai could only cry\nfor help helplessly, \"Seek master, save\nme! My cultivation base is dropping.\"\nSeeing this, Koyeta immediately shouted,\n\"He actually has this kind of method. If\nnot eliminated, there will be endless\ntrouble.\" Koyeta started rushing towards\nthem, simultaneously ordering Tranmack,\n\"Kid, let go of my pillct elder.\"\nTranmack quickly turned his head to look\nat him, powerfully releasing a beam of\nforce towards Kon Noyeta. The\nsurrounding people immediately disgusted\nanimatedly. What is that? It looks like\nthe flying sword of the sword immortal\nin legends. Could he be a sword\nimmortal? Koyeta was also stunned to the\npoint of stupifaction, secretly sighing,\nthe aura of that beam of light is so\nstrong. I I want to kneel down. No, I\ncan't. I can't admit defeat. But Coyha\nseemed to still have the strength to\nthreaten. I am the number one person in\nthe pill refining world. What tricks are\nyou playing? Get lost immediately.\nBefore he finished speaking, Tramax's\npower had already rushed into his body,\ncausing him to groan in pain. Uh Colam\non the side immediately roared. Beast,\nyou dare to kill my father. Go to hell.\nTranmack remained standing in place,\nabsorbing the true energy in Elder Kai's\nbody. The old man could only scream\npowerlessly. My cultivation base. My\ncultivation base. Tramax smiled and\nasked Colam back. What did you say? I\ndidn't hear clearly. Say it again. Colam\nwas so angry he could only stutter. You.\nYou. Then Colam turned to the crowd\nwatching the excitement around them\nscreaming. Everyone. Now he killed my\nfather. The next ones to be killed will\nbe you. Everyone rush up with me.\nEliminate this bastard. He didn't know\nthat a force was rushing toward him.\nWhen the power hit his face, Colam\nexclaimed in surprise, \"What?\" Deep\nTatoo in the crowd saw this scene and\ncouldn't help calculating in her heart.\nHe attacks so ruthlessly, \"Could the\nnext person be me?\" The one who stole\nthe medicine king Grand Cannon. \"No, no\nway. I don't want to die. I can't die.\"\nAt the same time, Tramac glanced at the\njudge beside him. \"Judge, I won. Where\nis the bet?\" The judge replied, \"We\ndon't know where the medicine king Grand\nCannon is kept. That is an item\npersonally kept by the semaster. No one\nknows where it is. Deep to to below the\nstage suddenly raised her hand and\nanswered loudly. I know where Con Noa\nhid it. I'll take you guys to get it.\nDeep to's Marshall uncle heard this and\nasked, \"Oh, Miss Deep is so\nenthusiastic.\" Deep Tut to didn't say\nanother word. Immediately kneeling down,\nsaying, \"Marshall uncle, I was wrong.\nThe pill sect has always treated me as\nan outsider suppressing me.\" Only then\ndid I understand how good Medicine King\nValley was to me. All these years I've\nalways regretted it. She cowtowed while\nspeaking. I don't beg uncle to forgive\nme. I only beg marshall uncle to let me\nreturn to medicine king valley. That way\nI can die in peace. That marshall uncle\njust replied. The medicine king valley\ntemple is small. It cannot contain a\ngreat Buddha like you. Just then\nTranmack opened his mouth to smooth\nthings over. Just let her take us there\nfirst. Take her back to medicine king\nvalley. Then we'll see. That marshall\nuncle agreed. Then let's do that. Tramac\nalso turned his head to instruct the\npeople behind him. You guys protect\nMachin Fong well if there are any\naccidents or chaos. Before Tramac\nfinished speaking, they quickly replied,\n\"Rest assured, there won't be any\nmistakes.\" Tran Mack withdrew his hand.\nTurning around to walk out, then I'll\ntake my leave first. When Tran Mack\nwalked through the crowd, they all\nstared at him and exclaimed, \"I remember\nnow. Aren't you Grandmaster Trant? Could\nit be the Kinep Grandmaster Tran? No\nwonder he could easily defeat Co Noyeta.\nGrandmaster Tran number one on the\ndivine leaderboard. The entire ancient\nmartial arts world has to be wary. A\nmoment later, Tran Mack appeared at Yen\nQui Lake. He calculated silently. Now\nuse the medicinal herbs obtained earlier\nto refine spirit medicine, making up for\nthe internal injuries in the body. Just\nthen, the phone rang. Tramac picked up\nand asked, \"How is it?\" On the other\nend, a panicked voice rang out, urging\nTramac to hurry to the school because\nsomething big had happened. Old co was\nbeaten and emo dung yini was taken away.\nYinho Ton saw the person arriving and\nsaid happily, Tranmac, you finally came.\nThen Yin Hoai Ton briefly recounted the\nincident to Tranmack. It's like this. A\nfew days ago, a transfer student named\nHong Hong Quac appeared claiming to be\nMod Dong Yani's fiance. He harassed her\njust like a pervert. Colam Fong laughed\nscornfully, continuing, \"I want to\nreason with him, but he had a bodyguard\nbeside him, at least at the Grandmaster\nlevel. That's why I ended up like this.\"\nVan Knox said extremely furiously.\nMoreover, Emo Dung Yani has gone\nmissing. It's 80 to 90% done by that\nbastard Hong Hong Quac. Hatchkin stepped\nin front of Tramac saying angrily, \"We\ncalled her father, but he basically\ndidn't care, saying it wasn't convenient\nto show his face.\" Is that what a father\nshould say? Tranmack lightly rested his\nchin on his hand in thought. Fiance,\nGrandmaster bodyguard, even the\nbiological father doesn't intervene. It\nseems this Hong Hung Quac has some power\nbacking him at this time. Yin Hoai\ntonpoke Trram's chest with his finger,\nasking, \"Old Tran, you aren't scared,\nare you? Before you were the one who\nasked us to take care of Emo Dong Yani.\"\nTrust calmly replied, \"How could that\nbe? Don't worry. I will find the person\nand bring her back and I will definitely\ndemand justice for old company. Just as\nthey were discussing countermeasures,\nEmmo Dong Yin Ni was having her hands\ntied tightly. She struggled helplessly\nwhile loudly cursing Hong Hong Quac. Our\nmarriage was just casually mentioned by\nthe elders. Even if you do anything to\nme, I will never like you. Emini\nsaid a string of words, then shouted. Do\nyou understand? Eldest young master Hong\nHong Hung Quac slowly walked out,\nreplying, \"It's fine. Take it slowly. We\nhave plenty of time.\" Although Mo Dong\nYin Ni was afraid, she still threatened.\n\"You will regret this.\" Hong Hong Quac\nstared excitedly at the girl on the\nbed,\" replied, \"I only regret not coming\nto find you sooner. Regret not claiming\nyou for myself earlier.\" Just as he\napproached Emo Dong Yini, a voice rang\nout. Young Master Hong Hung Quac was\nstartled, turned his head, and asked,\n\"Old Vong, what is it?\" He scolded\nangrily at a critical moment, \"Can you\nnot disturb me?\" But Old Vong reported\nanxiously, \"Young Master Grandmaster\nTran is looking for Emo Dong Yani. His\nstrength is very powerful.\" Our Hong\nfamily simply cannot withstand him. Old\nVong kindly advised, \"You should release\nthis girl immediately. Go apologize and\nadmit your mistake.\" Out of respect for\nthe old master, perhaps he will spare\nyou. But Hong Hung Quac roared like a\nmadman. Are you crazy? Tell me to\napologize to him. Keep dreaming. Old\nVong helplessly turned to leave. Before\nleaving, he added, stubbornly refusing\nto wake up. You only have a path to\ndeath. Forgive me for not being able to\naccompany you any longer. Old Vong\nquickly flew away. People in the room\ncould still hear his voice echoing back.\nI am, after all, a person of the martial\narts world. I cannot be disrespectful to\nGrandmaster Tran. Goodbye. Hong Hung\nQuac cursed angrily. This damn old man.\nMy Hong family fed you for so many\nyears, wasting rice. Yet you flee when\nbattle comes. Meanwhile, Tran Mack\noutside happened to see the streak of\nlight left by old Vong as he flew away.\nAlthough Emo Dong Yani was tied up, she\nstill threatened. Do you know how the\nword death is written? Hong Hong Ka\nquickly took off his shirt, pointed at\nher face, and scolded. Then\nsaying suddenly Hong Hung felt as if\nsomeone had squeezed his vital point\ntightly. His whole body went stiff.\nOutside the door, Tranmack warned in a\ndeep voice. Don't move. Your heart is\nalready under my control. Hong Hung Quac\nangrily turned his head to warn. I'm a\nmember of the Hong family. You cannot.\nBut Tranmack quickly clenched his fist,\ncausing him to jump up in pain. Tramac\nturned to ask Emo Dong Yin Ni, who was\ntied on the bed. Are you okay? She\nreplied softly. I'm fine. This guy\ndeserves to die, but what he said makes\nsense. He is from the Hong family, which\nhas deep power. It will bring trouble to\nyou. Immediately after, the ropes were\nuntied. Tramac held Mod Dong Yini in his\narms and replied firmly, \"I'm not\nafraid. I'll take you home.\" After\ntaking Mod Dong Yin knee to her\ndoorstep, Tramac waved goodbye to her.\nHis phone rang again. As soon as he\npicked up, the other side shouted\nangrily, \"You've caused a huge\ndisaster.\" \"Do you know that?\" Kuang\nHa's son said with both anger and worry\nthat Hong Hong Quacu killed his\ngrandfather is an old general with\noutstanding meritorious service. Now\nhe's making a big fuss. Trammac heard\nthis and simply replied, \"No wonder he\nwas so arrogant. So what do you guys\nwant?\" Kuang Ha's son rubbed his\nforehead, saying that he had argued with\nhim all day and finally managed to\ntemporarily appease him. But on the\nother end of the line, Tranmack\nimmediately replied, \"Just say it\nstraight.\" Kuang Ha's son said,\n\"Seriously, he wants you to come to the\nHong family, wear morning clothes, and\nstand guarante\nfor 7 days.\" After the salvation ritual,\nhe will not pursue what you did before,\nand will also join forces with you to\noppose the ancient marshall clan.\nHearing this, Tranmax surprisingly\nagreed. \"Then I will go.\" Kuang Ha's son\nasked in astonishment, \"Huh? What did\nyou say? Are you really going?\" Tramac\nhung up the phone then laughed and said\nha of course I have to go at this moment\nat the Hong family. Behind a few masters\nwere Hong Hung Quac's relatives wailing.\nBoohoohoo young master died so young.\nBoohoohoo. The Hong family head Hong\nDynam cried for a while then looked up\nsaying resentfully Tranmax methods are\ntoo cruel. Tranm appeared beside him\nasking very cruel and it seems you are\ntoo ignorant. Hungai Nam looked at him\nwith hatred asking you really dare to\ncome? He pointed forward, ordering, \"A\nplace has been prepared for you up\nahead. Hurry up and change in a morning\nclothes, then go chant sutras for my\nson.\" Tranmac stood among the Hong\nfamily members, speaking clearly. I did\nnot come to pay respects to young Master\nHong. Old General Hong, I am Tranmac. I\nadmire your character. So today, I\nspecially came to visit the old master\nof the Hong family. Hearing this, Hong\nOi lifted the sword in his hand and\nasked, \"Grandmaster Tran, do you dare to\ntake a strike for me?\" Tramac looked at\nhim solemnly, uttering one word,\n\"Please.\" The two were immediately\nsurrounded in the center. Hong Oi took a\nstance, saying, \"The feud of killing my\ngrandson. You must accept it.\" Having\nsaid that, he immediately launched an\nattack. Tramac only took one step back,\nthen caught the sword with his bare\nhand. Tranmack shook it slightly and the\nblade immediately shattered inch by\ninch. The surrounding crowd exclaimed,\n\"Impossible. He could actually block old\nHong's strike with his bare hands.\"\nTranmac smiled and said to the opponent,\n\"Old General Hong is upright and\nresolute, fair and strict. I, Tranmac,\nas a general, have come to visit. Is\nthis how you treat guest?\" Hongo's face\ndarkened as he replied. I knew early on\nyou didn't come here to mourn, but my\nHong family is not a place for people to\nhumiliate at will. Tranmack continued,\nold General Hong, I respect your\nprestige in the military, but you let\nyour grandson reach this age without\neven the ability to protect himself.\nHong oi closed his eyes, suppressing his\ngrief and said, \"But he was still my\ngrandson after all. To ask me to easily\nforgive you, I'm not resigned to it.\"\nHearing that, Tramac asked softly, \"So,\nwhat do you want?\" Hung Oi opened his\neyes staring at the opponent and asked\nTranmack, \"Do you dare to storm the\nAncient Marshall Clan one more time?\"\nTramac laughed and replied, \"Haha, I\nwill follow your wish.\" Afterwards, the\ntwo stood at Thin Fong City of the\nAncient Marshall Clan. Hong Oi turned\nhis back to Tranmack, looking at the\nscenery outside and spoke. This thin\nfong city is the metallurgy site of the\nancient Marshall clan, possessing a\nmassive defense force and a large-scale\nweapons manufacturing plant. We will\nsplit up and destroy this place. He\nstroked his beard and continued, \"Kid\nTran, I hate you to the bone.\" But Hasha\ncannot be without you. I am forced to\nsuppress the anger in my heart. Hung\nturned to look at Tring, so follow me.\nIf successful, it will benefit Hasha. If\nwe fail, we leave it to heaven's will.\nHearing this, Tranmack glanced at him,\npretended to be stupid, scratched his\nhead and smiled, asking, \"So, do you\nhope I succeed or fail?\" Hung Oi glared\nsideways at Tranmack, laughing, \"Whether\nyou succeed or fail, I won't suffer a\nloss.\" Haha. After speaking, he said\nagain, \"I'll go first.\" Having said\nthat, he immediately flew away. Tran\nMack calculated inwardly, \"There are\nmany experts in the factory. I can't\njust walk in openly.\" Just then, a truck\ndrove into the factory area. Tranmack\nimmediately seized the opportunity,\ncoming up with a plan. Got it. Let's do\nthat. Tranmack nimly crawled under the\ntruck, holding on to the chassis with\none hand, raising the other to perform\nthe mystic art of flowing concealment.\nTranmack felt the truck slowly rolling\ninside. He planned to follow the truck\nin, determined to cause a really big\ncommotion. A huge explosion suddenly\noccurred in the factory. The workers\nasked each other in panic. What's\nhappening? There's a sneak attack.\nTranmack had used the concealment art,\nso he stepped out confidently, thinking,\n\"Could it be that old master Hong is\ncausing destruction?\" The workers ran\nand screamed, \"It's a cultivator. We\nmust use special equipment.\" On the\nother side, a young man suddenly\nshouted, \"Follow me to get the\nequipment. We can't let the intruder\nescape.\" Tranmack watched the crowd\nrunning inside in panic. Couldn't help\nbut be satisfied. The chance to\ninfiltrate the weapons factory has come.\nStanding at the door, Tranmack could\nalready hear them urging each other,\n\"Quick, hurry up. Kill that damned\nintruder.\" Tranmack, seeing this,\nthought to himself, \"It's about time.\"\nSetting off fireworks for the new year\nalready. At the same time, outside the\nworkers were searching for the culprit\neverywhere. Meanwhile, in another\ncorner, Hong Oi was hiding in a pile of\ntrash nearby. He covered his mouth with\nhis hand, muttering, \"Cough. I didn't\nexpect not to be able to enter the\nfactory and on top of that be surrounded\nand heavily injured. I have to hide here\ntemporarily, but suddenly a loud\nexplosion came from ahead. Honk Oi\ncouldn't help but poke his head out to\nlook, exclaiming, \"What?\" From within\nthe raging fire. Two lines of words\nappeared. Honk Oi couldn't help but give\na thumbs up and praise this kid. Not\nbad. Well done. But at the same time, on\nthis side, the workers were gathering\ntowards the column of black smoke,\nshouting in unison. Tranmack, come out.\nYou can't escape. As long as you submit\nto the ancient Marshall clan, you will\nenjoy glory and wealth. Below one person\nbut above 10,000. Someone shouted\nangrily. Tranmack, you're dignified the\nnumber one on the divine leaderboard.\nWhy have you turned into a shrinking\nturtle like that? Tranmack standing\nright behind him heard this and placed\nhis hand on his shoulder, replying, \"You\nasked for it.\" The guy was startled,\nspun around, and screamed. Tranmack\nthrew a lightning fast punch at the\nopponent's chest while declaring, \"The\nduel is over.\" Their movement attracted\nthe attention of the surrounding\nworkers. They surrounded Tranmack,\nclamoring, \"It's Tranmack. Tranmack is\nright behind us. Attack!\" The sect\nleader has ordered, \"Whoever kills\nTranmack will be appointed as one of the\nfive great elders. Kill him!\" Tranmax\nscratched his head helplessly,\nmuttering, \"Truly leaves a deep\nimpression.\" A few hours later, at\nsomeone's feet, only the ground\nblackened by fire and the scattered,\ndefeated bodies of the workers remained.\nStanding before the pile of corpses\nstacked like a mountain, the factory\nmanager asked the person next to him in\npanic. General, what should we do? The\ngeneral replied in a stern voice, \"Hurry\nback and report to the sect leader.\nTranmax momentum is already established.\nWe must attack Hasha immediately,\notherwise the ancient Marshall clan will\nnever be able to raise its head again.\"\nThen he roared in anger. Tranmack, how\non earth can we kill you? Early the next\nmorning, someone was still leisurely\nroasting fish by a campfire. It was none\nother than Tranmack. He sang happily,\n\"Grilled fish. Grilled fish.\" Tranmack\nbrought the fish to his nose to smell,\nsaying softly, \"So fragrant, it must be\nready to eat.\" Suddenly, a mysterious\nold man appeared beside him, saying,\n\"Young man, eat a bit more. Once full,\nyou won't miss home.\" A glint of light\nflashed in his eyes as he continued.\nLater, you won't need to be a hungry\nghost anymore. Tranmack smelled the fish\nand spoke. State your name. The opponent\nimmediately replied, \"I am Baktu from\nConfu.\" Trickly finished the fish,\nchewing while speaking, \"You can't kill\nme. Why don't you tell me the story of\nthe snow god Palace, and we become\nfriends?\" Baktu raised his hand with a\nsolemn face and said, \"Tranmac, you grow\ntoo fast. You are a disaster for the\nancient martial world. He immediately\nlaunched an attack. Today, I will use\nAzure Dragon Shakes the sun to send you\non your way. Behind him, a giant dragon\nshadow appeared and rushed forward.\nTramac, without any fear, said, \"My\nblack dragon won't lose.\" Then the two\ndragons were seen rushing into each\nother, biting and tearing fiercely.\nSeeing this, Bachu couldn't help but\nexclaim, \"Surprisingly, it is not\ninferior to my Azure dragon at all. But\na few minutes later, Bach 2 saw the\nsituation was not good. Oh no, my azure\ndragon has been bitten to death. Tranmax\nblack dragon rushed straight at Bach 2,\ncausing him to grunt in pain. Uggh.\nTranmax stood in front of him and asked,\n\"Who did you say was sending whom on\ntheir way?\" Bachu sat slumped on the\nground. Speaking up to entice him,\n\"Wait, you want to know about the legacy\nof the snow god Palace? Right. I'm\nholding a map of the snow god Palace\nhere.\" Bachu pale with fear continued,\n\"Wait until the snow god palace appears.\nWe will join hands and share the\ntreasures.\" Tranmac immediately felt\ninterested, asking, \"Legacy? Speak more\nclearly.\" Bachu hurriedly stood up and\nrecounted, \"The snow god palace is the\npalace left behind by the snow god. It\nis said that years ago, the snow god\nsealed the snow god palace to search for\na missing lover. Only during the\nmid-aumn festival every year does the\nsnow god palace appear. Inside the\npalace, the snow god's voice still\nremains. Baktu seemed to remember\nsomething. That mysterious person seemed\nto have said, \"I wait for you to\nreturn.\" Hearing this, a figure appeared\nin Tranmax's mind. Little Junior sister.\nSeeing the tormented look on Tranax's\nface, Bachtu even suggested, \"If you\nthink an equal split isn't okay, then\nyou take eight, I take two.\"\nUnexpectedly, Tran shouted angrily, \"How\ndare you coveret my little junior\nsister's things?\" Tranmack waved his\nhand, immediately knocking Bach 2 onto\nhis back on the ground. While the old\nman was lying with his limbs pointing to\nthe sky, Tranmack quickly searched his\nbody. A ring immediately appeared in\nTrram's hand. He muttered, \"Let me see\nwhere the map is.\" Tranmack applied a\nlittle force and the map lay neatly in\nhis hand. Tranmac thought to himself,\n\"The map is in hand. When the time\ncomes, I will go find you, little junior\nsister.\" At the same time, Hong Oi was\ncalculating as he walked. Tranmac was\nindeed an indispensable talent for\nHashia. But what about his own grandson?\nOr should he let his daughter-in-law\ngive birth to another one? He thought\nfor a moment and concluded, \"Right, have\nanother one.\" Then I will personally\nteach and nurture him into a true\ntalent. But just at this moment,\nsomething attacked him from behind. Hong\noi turned his head in surprise to look\nat the asalent, but in the end, he still\nfell to the ground in pain, unconscious.\nHad a night. The scene was terrifyingly\nquiet. Seeing this, Tranmack couldn't\nhelp but exclaim, \"Huh? Why is it so\nquiet? This atmosphere isn't right.\"\nWhen Tran Mack walked into a tavern, a\nwaiter suddenly spoke up. \"I didn't\nexpect there would still be people\ndaring to come out to drink at this\nhour.\" Trly asked the waiter, \"Huh? Did\nsomething happen recently?\" The other\nparty did not hide anything. And\nreplied, \"You don't know? Are you\nkidding? Or are you the type who stays\ncooped up at home all day and never goes\nout?\" The waiter said fearfully, \"This\nis an earthshattering matter. Tranmack\njoined the ancient marshall clan,\nmurdered the old general Hong Oi, and a\ngrand chief covered for him. Tranmack\nhas been captured by the major\naristocratic families, Kuang Haon was\nkilled, and this Hasha is about to\nchange completely.\" Hearing a series of\nnews, Tranmack immediately uttered two\nwords. What? Tran tongue 2 on the other\nend of the line reported the major\nfamilies in Hashia colluded with the\nancient marshall world using Hong Oi's\ndeath as an excuse to rebel quickly\ncontrolling the grand chief. Tran tongue\ntoo added I have brought your relatives\nand friends to this villa for\nprotection. The ancient marshall world\ntemporarily dares not touch this place.\nTranmack heard this and replied I know.\nAfter hanging up the phone, Tranmack\nmade up his mind. He must quickly rescue\nthe Grand Chief and restore the inherent\norder of Hashia. Tranmack rushed away in\nanger, gritting his teeth. Since you\npeople want to seek death, then I will\nfulfill your wish. At a secret location,\na group of soldiers was guarding a\nhouse. Suddenly, a brick was thrown\ninside. The person inside immediately\nshouted, \"Careful!\" Immediately after,\nsomeone with quick hands and sharp eyes\ncaught the brick. That person squeezed\nhard, crushing the brick into powder. He\ndiscovered a piece of paper inside. The\npeople around heard him read, \"Use the\nsnow god Palace map to exchange for the\nGrand Chief. Transaction tomorrow night\nin the southern suburbs of Hadu.\nOtherwise, the fish dies and the net\ntears.\" The person holding the letter\nwhispered, \"It's the snow god palace\nagain.\" The people around couldn't help\nbut complain angrily. He dares to\nthreaten us. We cannot trade. Conquering\nHashia is our top priority, but the\nvalue of the snow god palace. You all\nshould be clear about it. A blonde man\nnearby spoke up. No need to argue\nanymore. First, use the Grand Chief to\nexchange for the map. Then, kill that\nperson and snatch the Grand Chief back.\nThat will be it. At dusk the next day,\nthey gathered at the appointed location.\nTranmax stood on the opposite side,\nquietly asking, \"Have you brought the\nperson?\" He even smiled and said, \"I am\nvery sincere.\" Then he held up a scroll\nand said, \"This is the map of the snow\ngod palace.\" Seeing this, the opponent\nordered the subordinates behind. Bring\nhim out. The subordinates immediately\nescorted a group of tied up people out.\nThey even urged, \"Move fast. Don't\ndoawtle.\" The Grand Chief saw the person\nin front of him and couldn't help but\nexclaim in surprise, asking Tranmack,\n\"Why are you here?\" Tramac just smiled,\nreplying, \"Does this even need to be\nasked?\" The people behind the Grand\nChief panicked and called for help.\n\"Grandmaster TR, save us quickly.\nGrandmaster TR, save our lives.\" The\npurple-haired man raised his hand to\norder. Hand over the map, and I will\nrelease them. Tramac raised the map\nagain to threaten. Release the people\nfirst. I will burn it. The opponent was\nafraid. Immediately shouting, \"Release\nthem.\" The subordinates kicked the Grand\nChief and ordered, \"Go, go quickly.\"\nAfter the hostages had returned to\nTranmack's side, the purple-haired man\nasked quietly, \"Is it okay now?\" The\nGrand Chief behind him whispered a\nreminder to Tranmack. \"These people are\nexperts from the cultivation world. They\nhave unified the ancient Marshall clan\nand are acting under the name of the\nConfang sect. Their strength cannot be\nunderestimated. You must be careful.\nTramac just smiled and replied, \"I know.\nI have a way to deal with them.\nEveryone, leave here quickly. Don't get\nin my way.\" The purple-haired man\nopposite couldn't help but urge again.\nNow that the people are gone, hand over\nthe map. The blonde man next to him\ncontinue to threaten. He must have told\nyou, \"We come from the tin lawn sect of\nthe cultivation world. Your talent is\nextraordinary. If you hand over the snow\ngod palace map to us, I will take you as\na disciple and your future will be\nboundless. Tramac heard this and laughed\nloudly twice. Tranmack looked up at the\nsky, then affirmed firmly, \"You people\njust want to imprison everyone and take\nover this place.\" Tranmack spread his\narms and shouted, \"But I, Tranmack, do\nnot allow it.\" Behind him, the black\ndragon was roaring in anger. Right at\nthat moment, a phenomenon appeared in\nthe sky. The purple-haired man screamed\nin terror. The sevenst star formation\nhas started. Immediately after, pillars\nof light shone directly onto the group\nfrom the tin lawn sect. The pillars of\nlight suck them up into the air one by\none. The people below resisted while\nreminding each other. Everyone use full\npower to withstand the formation.\nTranmack even intentionally asked, \"It\nseems you guys aren't very comfortable,\nare you?\" An old man from the Tin Lawn\nsect shouted angrily. \"You don't know\nwho you were dealing with. We are\ncultivators of the Tin Lawn sect. Do you\nknow what consequences you will face for\ndoing this? Tranmax still calmly asked\nthe opponent. Oh, then tell me what\nconsequences will I face? The old man\ntried hard to threaten. You'll be hunted\ndown by the Tinlon sect. Your body will\nbe minced into a thousand pieces and\nyour divine soul will be burned by\nendless fire. Tramac heard this and\npretended to be afraid, asking, \"Is it\nthat scary?\" The opponent thought it was\ntrue and warned. Since you know fear,\nhurry up and withdraw this damn\nformation. You should join the Tinlon\nsect and cultivate the great Dao with\nus. Tramac put a hand on the opponent's\nshoulder and said, \"Hearing you say that\nthe power of the Tin Lawn sect is indeed\nvery large. If I provoke you, I'm afraid\nI won't have peaceful days in the\nfuture.\" The old man believed it\ncompletely and even smiled, saying,\n\"Knowing that is good. Hand over the\nsnow god Palace map. My brothers and I\nwill put in a good word for you in front\nof the sect leader. If there are\nbenefits, your share will definitely not\nbe missing. Tranmack replied softly. I\naccept your good intentions. However, I\nhave thought of another way. The\nopponent stammered you. What do you want\nto do? Tranmax simply replied calmly.\nKill all of you for the tin lawn sect.\nThen who will know it was me? Having\nsaid that, Tranmack immediately struck\nand cut off one of the opponent's arms.\nThe old man looked in horror at his\nmissing right arm. Tranmack sneered. Not\nonly will I not kill you immediately,\nbut I also want you to watch a good\nshow. The blonde man next to him asked\nTran Mack loudly, \"What do you want to\ndo?\" Tranmack then turned and walked\ntowards him. The blonde man immediately\ncried out in fear. \"You don't come over\nhere.\" But before Tran Mack could act,\nthe blonde man was controlled by the\npillar of light to the point where his\nwhole body trembled. \"Uggh. Uh huff,\"\nTran Mack said disdainfully. To think\nyour protective true energy became\ndisordered due to fear, leading to an\ninability to withstand the energy of the\nseven star formation. After that, Tramac\nlooked over at the purple-haired man who\nwas tough talking just now. That guy\nbegged, \"Don't come over. Don't.\"\nTranmack coldly walked through the\ncrowd, heading straight for the\npurple-haired man. They were controlled\nto death by the pillars of light one by\none. Tranmack stood in front of the\npurple-haired man and asked, \"They all\nbegged for mercy. Why didn't you say a\nword? The opponent replied weakly.\nDidn't they also get killed by you after\nbegging? So why should I throw away my\nlast bit of dignity before dying?\nTranmax smiled with satisfaction. You\nare very right. I used the crulest means\nto kill you. You people must have done\nthis kind of thing not a few times in\nthe past, right? Do you regret it now?\nThe opponent laughed out of anger. Haha.\nRegret. Whose hands among those who\ncultivate the Dao are not stained with\nblood. The big fish eats the small fish.\nIt has always been like this. What is\nthere to regret? Tramac didn't say much\nmore, assuming an attacking stance as he\nsaid, \"Makes sense, then you go die.\"\nUnexpectedly, the purple-haired man\nsmiled sinisterly. Dark power exploded\nfrom his body in an instant, knocking\nTranmack away. The guy stroked his beard\nand laughed. \"What a pity! Wasting one\nof my magic treasures and still failing\nto kill you. Your cheap life is really\ntough. However, you won't be so lucky\nthis time.\" The purple-haired man of the\ntin lawn sect stood with his hands on\nhis hips and said to Tranmack, \"To think\nyou could set up such a highle formation\nlike the Northstar Sevenstar formation,\n\"Hand over the formation method, and I\nwill spare your life.\" Although in pain,\nTranac's tongue remained sharp. If you\nhave the skill, come and take it\nyourself. The opponent immediately\nthreatened, \"I won't let you die a quick\ndeath.\" The purple-haired man channeled\nhis energy, gritting his teeth as he\nsaid, \"Today, I will open your eyes to\nthe ultimate technique of our tin lawn\nsect, the starfist.\" He rushed towards\nTranmack, shouting loudly, \"Die.\"\nTranmack calculated silently in his\nheart. Why not take this opportunity to\nuse him to temper my own cultivation\ntechnique? While calculating, a halo of\nlight appeared around Tranmack. He even\nactively rushed up to meet the attack,\ncausing the purple-haired man to exclaim\nin shock. \"What?\" But the purple-haired\nman still threw a punch, hitting Tran\nMack right in the stomach. Tran Mack\npainfully took this blow. The other guy\nsaid smuggly, daring to rush up, seeking\ndeath yourself. Tran's body was knocked\nback 10 m. The purple-haired man panted\nheavily and muttered, \"This Transmac is\ntruly a fool. I hope this starfish\nstrike can actually kill him.\" Then he\nturned his head and asked his\nsubordinates, \"Has the sevenstar\nformation been dispelled yet?\" The\nsubordinates suddenly pointed forward\nand shouted, only to see Tranmac, beaten\nand covered in injuries, yet still\nlaughing and saying, \"Ahaha, feels great\nagain.\" The purple-haired man furiously\nthrew another punch, get lost. Tranmack\nquickly took a step back, trembling as\nhe laughed and said, \"Haha, still not\nenough.\" The purple-haired man screamed\nin rage. I don't allow you to come over\nhere. only to see Tranmax spreading his\narms wide. They immediately sensed it.\nHuh? The star formation is disappearing.\nPerhaps Tran Mack is about to die. After\nescaping the control of the pillar of\nlight, the purple-haired man's\nsubordinates immediately rushed up,\n\"Let's attack together.\" They punched\nand kicked Tranmack furiously, saying\nconfidently, \"Could he alone withstand\nthe three of us?\" The purple-haired man\nalso immediately rushed up to take\nrevenge. He viciously punched Tranax old\nwound, then added another punch.\nUnexpectedly, Trax struggled to laugh\nand say, \"Haha, the more you hit me, the\nmore comfortable I feel.\" This drove the\nopponent crazy, cursing, \"Damn it, this\nguy is like a cockroach. No matter how\nmuch you hit him, he won't die.\" At this\nmoment, a subordinate behind suddenly\nshouted, \"My spiritual energy is running\nout.\" Another one beside him chimed in,\n\"Me, too.\" Hearing this, the\npurple-haired man was instantly\nterrified, his face turning pale.\nWithout a word, he turned and ran. Run\nfirst. Tranmack placed his hands on the\nshoulders of the remaining two, asking,\n\"You guys want to run, too? Having\nfought for so long, try taking one of my\nmoves.\" The purple-haired man, who had\nrun far away, turned his head back, only\nto see a huge explosion behind him.\nWhile he was panicking and dazed, Tramax\nsuddenly appeared right in front of him\nand said, \"And you, too.\" The\npurple-haired man was scared green,\nexclaiming, \"Tranmack, you can't kill\nme.\" Tranmack quickly responded with a\npunch to the opponent's chest. Asking\nback, \"Must I listen to what you say?\"\nThen Tramac held a pill in his hand and\nsaid, \"All right, having endured so many\nattacks, the golden core is finally\nabout to form.\" Tramac tossed the pill\nhigh up, shouting loudly, \"Come on,\ngolden core form.\" At the same time, in\na certain room, the sound of weeping\nrang out. Who? Who? Who? You must seek\njustice for me. That person clasped his\nhands and reported that Tranmack killed\nmy son and killed my father, too. My\nhatred for him is as deep as the ocean.\nThe long-haired man standing in front\nturned his head slightly and said, \"Your\nfather's death has nothing to do with\nme. Don't pretend to be innocent like\nthat. I know there are plenty of your\nspies here, too.\" After that, the\nopponent frowned and asked, \"About that\ntramac? How much do you actually know?\"\nThe young man replied blankly, \"I've\ntold you everything I know. Still can't\nkill him.\" The long-haired man said\nhatefully, \"Not only couldn't kill him.\"\nOur tin lawn sect had a total of 10\nexperts, including a half-step golden\ncore, all killed by him. Hearing this,\nthe weeping young man was so shocked his\neyes widened and his mouth hung open.\nTin lawn sect. Aren't you an elder of\nthe con fuang sect? Also, how is this\nTransmax so powerful? Even a halfstep\ngolden core expert isn't his match. The\nlong-haired man immediately replied,\n\"The Confuang sect is merely a vassel of\nTinlon. We are countless times stronger\nthan you people on Emperor Seedstar.\nWork for us and you will receive endless\nbenefits.\" Hearing this, the young man\nthought to himself, \"Is this the rumored\nalien? Why does he look no different\nfrom us?\" The long-haired young man\nclosed his eyes slightly. Speaking, the\ngap between half-step Golden Corps and\nGolden Core is like heaven and earth.\nThe one Tramac killed was merely a\nhalf-step golden core. Then the\nlong-haired young man raised his hand\nand continued, \"I went to see the\nscene.\" He used an ancient formation,\nthe Northstar Sevenstar formation. He\nsucceeded thanks to the power of the\nformation. Speaking of this, his voice\ndeepened. However, in the intelligence\nyou gave me, there was no mention of\nTran Mack understanding this formation.\nHearing this, the opponent immediately\nraised his hands and panicked to\nexplain. This is the first time Tran\nMack has displayed such strength. We\nalso just found out. The long-haired\nyoung man asked calmly, \"Do you know\nTramac has a Macmon?\" The opponent asked\nback blankly, \"What Macmon?\" The\nlong-haired man said fanatically, \"Is\nthe place where all of Tranmax's forces\ngather called Macmon? I have spread the\nnews that the Kon fuang sect will\nmobilize a great army to attack MCM.\"\nHong Tien, how many troops can you\nprovide me? Hearing this, the opponent\nsaid awkwardly, \"You're acting\npersonally. Do you still need mortal\nsoldiers? Those weapons are basically\nuseless against Tramac. Hearing this,\nthe long-haired man said sinisterly, but\nthey are effective against Macon. If a\n100 artillery shells are fired at Macon,\nhe will naturally have to expend his\nvital energy to protect it. The more he\nspoke, the more excited he got,\ndetermined to use those mundane things\nto drain Transmax vital energy. That\nway, killing him will be as easy as\ncrushing an ant. After talking for a\nwhile, the long-haired man asked the\nopponent, \"So, can you support me?\" The\nyoung man immediately replied, \"Yes, I\ncan provide you with cannons plus 10\nhelicopters to suppress Tranmac from the\nair.\" The two quickly reached a happy\ncooperation agreement. Hong Tien happily\nwatched the handshake, thinking to\nhimself, \"Tranmac is definitely dead\nthis time. Those who cooperate with me\nhave no value left to exploit either.\nWhat great families of Washa! This Hasha\nonly needs my Hong family. Not long\nafter, the long-haired young man\ncontacted Tramac. Tramac, are you there?\nStargazing. Without waiting for the\nopponent to answer, he pointed at the\nscreen and said, \"Tranmac, I am Ma Tam\nDao of the Confu sect. In 3 days, I will\nattack MMON. If you don't show up, Macon\nwill instantly be raised to the ground.\"\nThe Grand Chief looked at the opponent,\nreminding Tranmac. This is all a\ndisaster caused by the K Fuang sect. The\nimage switched to another scene. The\nGrand Chief continued. They found an\nancient formation in Meow Jang. That\nformation has been reactivated by them.\nTramac looked at the screen and asked,\n\"Is it a teleportation array?\" The Grand\nChief exclaimed excitedly, \"Yes, it is\nthe teleportation array. This\nteleportation array leads to the\ncultivation world. Their people have\ncontacted experts of the Tinlon sect.\"\nThe Grand Chief spoke more and more\nsorrowfully. The Tinlon sect is full of\nambition, wanting to turn Emperor Seat\nStar into their colony to plunder\ncultivation resources. Hearing this,\nTranmack immediately understood. In\nother words, if the teleportation array\nis not destroyed, the Tinlon sect can\ncontinuously send people to Emperor\nSeedstar. The Grand Chief immediately\nconfirmed. Correct. This is exactly what\nI am worried about. Tranmack didn't say\nanother word. Standing up, I will go\ndestroy this formation. The Grand Chief\nasked anxiously. If you go, \"What about\nMacon?\" He suggested again. \"I'm afraid\nit's time we found someone to help.\"\nTranmax scratched his head helplessly,\nasking, \"I can't split myself in two.\nWho else can I find to help?\" The Grand\nChief suddenly raised his hand and said,\n\"There is someone extremely powerful.\nHow do war god Duong deni? Recently,\nmany things have happened in Hasha.\nFirst, old general Hong Oi died at the\nhands of his own son, Hong Tien. A\nconvoy of cars drove out one by one. And\nin the empty grass field nearby, someone\nwas secretly watching. Then Hong Tien\nwiped out both the Lie family and the\nDuong family. Now the Duong family only\nhas Duong Den Tien left. The young man\nhiding in that grass must be Duong Den\nTien. Duong Den Tien wants revenge, but\nhe is injured. His strength is not what\nit used to be. Duong Den Ten stared\nahead, thinking to himself. Hong Tien,\nI've been waiting for you for a long\ntime. Duong Den Ten rushed out despite\nthe pain. Hong Tien, you bastard. The\nsoldiers inside immediately rushed out\nwith guns. What's going on? Someone is\nblocking the car. Stop. They didn't say\nanother word, ordering to open fire\nimmediately, kill him. However, Duong\nDinti just sneered. He used all his\nstrength, knocking down all the soldiers\nwith just one move. The soldiers fell\nflat on the ground. Then Duong Den Tien\nshouted again. Hong Tien, \"Get the hell\nout here.\" Duong Den Tien said\nhatefully, \"You killed over a hundred\npeople of my Duong family. Today is your\ndeath date.\" Just then, a foot gently\nlanded on the ground. A blue-haired man\nappeared, laughing. \"Oh my, I wondered\nwho it was.\" Duong Din Tien, the Hong\nfamily head asked me to send his\nregards. He also said, \"Hong Tien\nmocked, not only your Duong family, the\nlive family is also finished, so you\ndon't need to be too sad. You'll have\ncompany after death.\" Duong Din Ten\nreacted immediately. Damn it, it's a\nbody double. It's a trap. Duong Den\nintended to turn and run immediately.\nNot good. Must flee quickly. But just as\nhe turned his head, he saw a group of\npeople had surrounded him from behind.\nHong Tien frantically shouted a warning.\n\"Still want to run? There are experts\neverywhere here. You can't escape. Duong\nDen Tin glared hatefully at Hong Tien,\nonly hearing the opponent say, \"Duong\nDien, this day next year will be your\ndeath anniversary.\" Duong deni paid no\nheed, asking himself, \"Is today really\nthe end of me?\" Duong deni Hong Tien\nspread his arms wide and laughed loudly.\n\"Yeah, haha. Then go die.\" Ah, auda.\nDuong Denten also mimicked his posture,\nlaughing loudly. If I die, you all must\nbe buried with me. Duong Den Tien's\nwhole body became unusually bright. Hong\nTien's men immediately realized, \"Not\ngood. He wants to self-destruct. Run\nquickly.\" Hong Tien warned in terror\nwith Duong Denten's divine realm\ncultivation. If he self-destructs, I'm\nafraid no one here will survive. Duong\nDenten seemed to have gone mad, laughing\nloudly. None of you will escape. But\nsuddenly, Duong Den Tien's terrifying\npower suddenly vanished. They all\nexclaimed, \"What?\" Then Duong Dent Tien\nclutched his chest and coughed. Hong\nTien sneered sarcastically. \"Looks like\nyou can't even self-destruct. The family\nhead has ordered. Whoever takes Duong\nDin Tien's head will enjoy wealth and\nglory.\" Immediately, Hong Tien's men\nscrambled towards Duong Den Tien. Just\nthen, a piercing shout rang out.\n\"Whoever dares to take a step forward\nwill be killed without mercy.\" Hong\nTien's men angrily questioned, \"Who are\nyou? dare to interfere in our business.\nBrat, best not to meddle. Get lost.\nTranmax stood in front to protect Duong\nDenten. If I don't leave, what can you\ndo to me? Duong Dien's life. I am\nprotecting today. O kid doesn't know\nlife from death. Everyone attack. Kill\nhim. Hong Tien's men shouted in unison\nand rushed up, \"Attack together. Kill\nhim.\" At the same time, Tramac also\nunleashed his blade technique. He\nlaunched his sword straight at them fast\nas lightning. Duong Dint Tien saw this\nchoking up you. Tranmax said solemnly,\n\"Hadu, war god, Duong Dinten, your\ndestiny, it should not end like this.\nThere are more important missions\nwaiting for you.\" Tranmack lifted Duong\nDenin into a bathtub, helping him heal.\nYou must recover. Duong Denten closed\nhis eyes and sat still in the tub.\nTranmac began to channel energy. Duong\nDien, I will activate the medicinal\neffects to help you break through. As\nfor how far you can break through, it\ndepends on your creation and luck. A\nthick black liquid ooze from Duong Den\nTien's body. He suddenly opened his eyes\nin surprise. Tranmack explained calmly,\nrefining the physical body, honing the\ntendons and bones. Naturally, it'll be\nextremely painful. Duong Denten, try to\nendure it. Hearing this, Duong Dentin\nobediently closed his eyes again.\nTranmax said, \"The medicinal water has\npushed all impurities out of your body.\nNow we can proceed to the next step. A\nmoment later, Tramac carefully helped\nhim out. Come here this way. Tramac\nplaced Duong Den inside a formation,\nthen stood aside to observe. Tranmack\nthought to himself, his body is greedily\nabsorbing spiritual energy. Duong Den\nTien's strength is getting stronger. He\ncan at least break through to the peak\nof the divine realm. A while later,\nDuong Denten suddenly opened his mouth\nto ask, \"You're Trac, right? We don't\nknow each other. Why did you save me?\nTranmack laughed coldly. Perishing\ntogether with a bunch of villains\nshouldn't be the fate of the Hadu war\ngod. Listen carefully. Hong Tien has\ndestroyed the Duong family and seize\npower. Both emotionally and logically\nyou Duong Dentien should take his life\nwith your own hands. Hearing this, Duong\nDin Tien screamed in shock. Hong Tien.\nHe clutched his head, his whole body\nerupting with terrifying power. Hi, you\nbastard. He laughed sinisterly. \"Oh ah,\nI remember everything. Honen, kill my\nwhole family. I must kill you.\" As soon\nas he finished speaking, Duong Deni\nrushed straight up the wall, asking\ncrazily. \"Hongen, where are you?\" He\nshouted loudly. \"I must kill you.\"\nTramac stood below, guessing silently.\n\"He has entered a demonic state.\" Tramac\nwas very surprised. Duong Dentin\noriginally wanted to self-destruct and\nperish with the enemy. Self-destruction\nfailed. Now he has entered a demonic\nstate due to hatred. Suddenly dark\nclouds accompanied by thunder and\nlightning appeared. A huge bolt of\nheavenly lightning struck straight down\nat Duong Denten. He seemed to use his\nwhole body to absorb all its power. W\nTramac frowned in worry. After entering\na demonic state, one must undergo a\nheavenly tribulation. This tribulation\nis not easy to pass. A single slip and\nhis soul will be scattered. I don't know\nif he attracted the 39 heavenly\nlightning or the 6ix9ine heavenly\nlightning. Tranmack observed him\nthinking hope Duong Denten can overcome\nthis calamity from a worm to a dragon. A\nbolt of lightning struck down causing\nDuong dinen to roar in pain. The intense\npain began to become more violent\nguani.\nEw. Ah. Tranmax stood by observing and\nsaid, \"Try to endure. There's still a\nlot of heavenly tribulation left.\" A\nmoment later, Duong Den Tin knelt on the\nground. Tranmac also exclaimed in\nsurprise, refined into a golden core.\nNo, what Dongden Tien condensed is not a\ngolden core. That golden core is full of\nbrutal energy. Perhaps calling it a\ndemon core is more accurate. Tranmack\nlooked up at the sky, saying happily,\n\"The sky is clear. Looks like it's\nover.\" Tranmac breathed a sigh of\nrelief, thinking to himself, \"Duong den\n10 overcoming the 39 heavenly\ntribulation at the golden core realm.\nHis future is limitless. Suddenly, he\nnoticed something was wrong. I don't\nsense the energy fluctuation of breaking\nthrough to the golden core. Why hasn't\nDuong Denten's demon core taken shape\nyet?\" A second later, dark clouds\nsuddenly surged back, obscuring the\nentire sky. This time the pillar of\nlight was 10 times larger than before.\nStriking straight down at Duong Denten.\nTramac was terrified. Not good. It's the\n69 heavenly tribulation. The huge\nexplosion cracked the ground. Tramac ran\nto Duong Denten to check the situation.\nThe physical body had turned to ash. The\ndemon core was absorbing the lightning\nenergy. In my past life, when I broke\nthrough to the golden core, let alone\nthe 6ix9ine heavenly tribulation, God\ndidn't even let out a farting. Julie\nlucky. Tranmac observed that demon core.\nIt had begun to reconstruct the physical\nbody. Duong Den touched his own body.\nTranmac looked seriously saying, \"Not\ngood. The demon core hasn't absorbed all\nfive bolts of lightning yet, and the\nstronger sixbolt is coming.\" The sky was\nfilled with swirling dark clouds. Tramac\nlooked at Duong Dentien with worry. His\ndemon core might shatter directly, but I\ncan't take it from him. Saying that,\nTranmac immediately left the spot. Can\nonly depend on your luck. The\ndestructive power this time was even\ngreater than the last. Debris flew\neverywhere. Tranmac watched anxiously.\nYou must hold on. A moment later,\nshattered rocks were scattered on the\nground. Duong Denten had survived that\nbolt of lightning. Seeing this, Tranmac\nbreathed a sigh of relief. Few\nfortunately, as long as the person isn't\ndead and the golden core isn't broken.\nDuong Denten will be fine. Tranmack\nrushed to Duong Denten's side. Are you\nokay? Tramac helped him up while saying,\nit should be over now. I will treat your\ninjuries. Tranmack accidentally\ndiscovered an ominous sign. Hanmaki,\nwhat Duong Den Tien attracted is the 99\nheavenly tribulation. A bolt of\nlightning struck towards Tran Mack, but\nhe quickly dodged it. Tran Mack roared\nangrily. Hey, the one who attracted you\nis in that pit over there. If you want\nto strike, go strike him. As soon as he\nfinished speaking, another bolt of\nlightning struck. Tramac was furious.\nWhy aim at me? Heavenly tribulation only\nappears during tribulation crossing. Yet\nwas attracted by Duong Dinten right in\nthe golden core stage. This has never\nhappened in cultivation history.\nHeavenly Tribulation not striking the\nperson crossing it, but instead\ntargeting a passer by. This is even more\nunheard of. Tranmax struggled to dodge\nthe lightning bolts, feeling a bit of\nhorror in his heart. Could this heavenly\ntribulation have mistaken me for duong\ndinten? But he had never heard that\nheavenly tribulation could mistake\npeople. Tranmack observed the direction\nof a lightning while thinking. In the\ncultivation world, those who can attract\nthe 99 heavenly lightning are extremely\nrare, appearing once in a thousand years\nwith a death rate of up to 99. But in\nthe next second, lightning struck down\nin unison, surrounding him, leaving him\nno way to hide. Tranmack looked at the\nlightning bolts sworn to hit him, having\nto make up his mind. It seemed he\ncouldn't avoid it today. Immediately, he\nlooked up at the sky and screamed long,\n\"Heaven, do you want to kill me,\nTranmack? Since it's like this, I will\nfight you to the end. Before the\nlightning touched his person, Tramac\ncharged up to meet the battle. Come on,\nheaven slashing sword. Sky profound\ndivine fist. Tranmack launched attacks\ncontinuously. But the lightning seemed\nunharmed. He glanced over, panting\nheavily, thinking, \"Damn it, completely\nuseless.\" Trash his killer move.\nNirvana. Lightning surrounded him. He\nroared with all his might. Ah, damn it.\nThe light faded. Tranmack felt his body\nmelting before the terrifying power of\nthe lightning. Have I lost? I can't die.\nI can't die. I haven't found my little\njunior sister yet. How can I die? In an\ninstant, Tran Mac's disintegrated soul\nbody was gradually reconstructed. The\ngolden core condensed and the divine\nsoul reorganized. Tran Mack clenched his\nfists, issuing a challenge to the\nheavenly tribulation. If you have the\nability, then kill my divine soul. Come\non. Come on. A black dragon gradually\nappeared. It was the black dragon\nascending heavenway. Tranmack was pushed\nto the limit. The power in his body\nbegan to awaken. That stream of\ndragon-shaped true energy surrounded\nTran Mac's body like a needle and thread\npassing through, actually stitching his\ntattered body back together. His\nphysical body was actually completely\nreconstructed. Transmac pursed his lips,\nthinking, \"The body has recovered. Must\nquickly merge soul and body.\" The\nheavenly tribulation is about to start\nagain, giving me no more time. Can only\nuse this move. The next second, soul and\nbody join forces to launch an attack.\nAh, come on. He used all his strength.\nThe lightning carrying death also struck\ndown on their heads. At the moment of\nimminent collision, soul and body\nattacked simultaneously. Ha. Tranmack\nwatched the black dragon swallowing the\nlightning. Thinking, \"My dragon's soul\nis absorbing all the energy of the\nheavenly lightning. He stood beside his\nphysical body, chanting in his heart,\nsoul and body merge.\" The next second,\nhis body and soul merged into one.\nTranmech shouted, \"Ah, how is it? If\nheaven wants to destroy me, I will kill\nheaven.\" In front of the sect gate,\npeople from the Tinlon sect had\nsurrounded the place. There were even\nhelicopters and tanks. Maam Dao looked\nin that direction with a vicious gaze.\nThe corners of his mouth curling up.\nTranmack. This time I'm forcing you to\nshow your face and confront me directly.\nYour family and friends are all in my\nhands. I'm not afraid you won't come.\nFinished speaking. He wave his hand to\norder. All troops attack. Several tanks\nrushed forward aggressively. The\nhelicopters above also continuously\nfired missiles. However, all attacks\nwere blocked by the mountain protection\narray that Tranmac had set up. Matam Dao\ngritted his teeth in anger. Formation\ndespicable trick. But the next second,\nhe pulled himself together, holding a\nmagical artifact and rushing up. Break\nit for me. Huh? This single strike\ncompletely shattered Tranmax formation.\nMateam Dao looked down at the crowd\nbelow and ordered, \"The formation is\nbroken. All forces, listen to my\ncommand.\" Today, MCM must be\nannihilated. Everyone in Mmon spare no\none. The people inside naturally sensed\nthat the formation was broken. Machin\nFong and the others rushed out,\nbeginning to engage them in battle.\nMatam Dao's decisive shout still echoed,\n\"Kill them all for me.\" Tranquac Luong\nwatched everyone's actions with sharp\neyes. Just then, a bullet was fired.\nTran Tongu panicstrickenly rushed\nforward to deal with the shooter, then\nlooked worriedly at Tranqu Quac Luong.\nTranquac Luong had been hit in the calf,\ncrying out in pain. Ugg. Tran Tong two\nstepped forward to support him. I'll\nhelp you up. Seeing Tranqu Quac Luong's\ncomplexion, Tran Tong 2 asked with some\nconcern. Ancestral master, are you all\nright? The enemy is too numerous. Let's\nretreat first. Tranquac Luong suddenly\nstood up, patting Tran Tongu's shoulder\nwith a calm gaze. It's fine. Although\nI'm not as I used to be, I won't lose my\nlife over such a small thing. You take\neveryone and retreat. I will join you\nsoon. Don't worry. I'll hold them off\nfor a while then leave. Hearing this,\nTran Tong too hesitated no longer and\nimmediately left quickly. Ancestral\nmaster, then I will withdraw first. The\nelderly Tranqu Quac Luong had a\ndetermined look in his eyes, speaking a\nsentence full of hidden meaning. All\nright, what a pity. Everyone take care.\nHearing this sentence, Tran Tongu's eyes\ntrembled slightly as he turned back. He\nleft the place with two others. Once\nsafe, Tran Tong too hurly turned to look\nat Machinfong and Yin Quinton asking,\n\"Is everyone okay? We are about to break\nout. Did anyone see ancestral master?\"\nJust then, a massive explosion occurred\ninside. Raging flames surging outward.\nThe three were stunned. Tran tongue too\nsuddenly screamed in horror. Its\nancestral master's aura. Ancestral\nmaster self-destructed. Matam Dao walked\nover with an arrogant expression,\ncomplaining, \"Was that old man just now\nyour ancestral master?\" Couldn't win, so\nhe self-destructed, getting dust all\nover me. Don't you lot learn from him?\nSeeing the ring leader right in front of\nhim, Tran tongue too clench his fists.\nMa Tam Dao, I'll fight you to the death.\nHearing this, he sneered, provoking,\ncome if you can. No matter how you\nstruggle and resist, a low-level sect\nlike a Macon is nothing but trash in my\neyes. Today, McMmon will certainly be\nexterminated. The three of them looked\nat him, their faces written with anger\nand anxiety. He stood there still\narrogantly questioning. Speaking of\nwhich, where has your sect leader Tran\ngone? In the sky, an object plummeted\ndown at extreme speed, friction creating\nsparks. Matam Dao frowned and cried out,\n\"Ah!\" The object hit the ground,\ncreating a powerful shock wave. \"Wait\nuntil the person who appeared was\nclearly seen to be Tranmac.\" Seeing\nTranmack appear, everyone in the sect\nwelcomed him with joy. Tran tongue too\nwas the first to step forward. He\nstaggered and knelt down, tears flowing\nuncontrollably. Master, you're finally\nback. This disciple apologizes to you,\nancestral master. He to protect Mmon. He\nself-destructed. Tranmack couldn't help\nbut gasp. The next second, he looked at\nthat despicable man, gritting out every\nword. Matam Dao, didn't you want me to\ncome? I'm right here. Didn't you want to\nkill me? I'm standing right here. Why\nhaven't you made your move yet? Ma Tam\nDao looked at Tramac with some\napprehension, thinking to himself, I\noriginally thought Tramac was at most a\nhalf-step golden core, but just now I\nsense his golden core cultivation is\nhigher than I imagined. But Matam Dao\nstill refused to admit defeat. He spoke\nloudly to reassure himself. Tranmack, no\nmatter how formidable or strong you are,\ncan you defeat the whole world? Today, I\nwill show you the outcome of opposing\nthe entire world. Tranmack sneered,\nlooking at him with icy eyes, opposing\nthe whole world. So what if I am the\nenemy of the whole world? Tranmack is\nhere. Who dares to fight me?\nImmediately, Matam Dao ordered the\npeople of the Tin Lawn sect. All of you\ntarget Tranmac. Beat him to death for\nme. Instantly, five or six tanks aimed\ntheir cannons at Tramac, firing\nsimultaneously. Tramax stood there tall\nand unmoving, completely unharmed. As\nthe smoke and dust cleared, Tranmax said\nin a deep voice, \"You help outsiders\ndeal with your own people deserving of\npunishment.\" \"Punishment.\" As soon as he\nfinished speaking, Tranax's entire body\nradiated a terrifying power. His scream\nechoing. The next second, that group of\npeople was incinerated, not even a speck\nof dust remaining. Seeing this scene,\nMatam Dao was already trembling inside,\nand now he was even more terrified. He\ngritted his teeth and thought, \"Such\nterrifying power, but his physical\nstrength must have limits. We must\nattack ceaselessly to drain his power.\"\nClearly, Maam Dao had decided to fight\nto the death with Tramac today, ordering\nthe rest again. Tramac is already\ninjured. Everyone attacked together. If\nwe don't kill him, we all have to die.\nOn this side, Tran calmly launched a\nmove, slashing Heavens Sword. In an\ninstant, a single move knocked them all\ndown. Behind him came a voice mixed with\nanger and sorrow. Mac, your grandfather,\nyou must not spare these bad people. It\nwas his parents. His mother held her\nface and sat on the ground, her voice\nweak, little Mac. Tranmack lowered his\nhead to look at the ground. Sorrow hard\nto conceal in his eyes. Grandfather, I'm\nsorry. Your grandson came a step too\nlate. Your grandson can only use the\nfresh blood of these people to offer\nsacrifices to your spirit in heaven.\nImmediately after, Tramac looked\nstraight at Mck Tam Dao. Sparks of\nhatred shooting from his eyes. Matam\nDao, let's fight to the death. He\nretorted without hesitation. Fight then\nfinish speaking. Both rushed toward each\nother. Matam Dao was still convinced\nTranmac was exhausted, saying\narrogantly, \"Tran Mack, you no longer\nhave abundant power. You certainly can't\nwithstand this blade of mine. Mountains\nsplitting blade method, third form.\nHeaven breaker. At the moment the blade\nslashed down, Tranmax simultaneously\nused the great divine ability Nirvana.\nThat blade shattered directly. Tranmack\nglanced over the corner of his mouth,\nlifting, go down to the underworld and\nregret provoking me. Matam Dao stammered\nin horror. What? Uh, damn it. He only\nhad time to curse once before losing his\nlife right there. Trax cold voice rang\nout. People of the tin lawn sect kill\nwithout mercy. On another side, a man\nwas maintaining a teleportation\nformation. He clased his hands and\nchanted, \"Thunder magic descends. Dark\nclouds roll. Divine command decree.\nListen to my order.\" In a moment,\nlightning from the sky struck down on\nthe formation. The man opened his eyes.\nA glint of smuggness in them. Now the\n10,000 thunder slaughtered rand\nformation is getting stronger and\nstronger. Later, this planet will be the\nterritory of our tin lawn sect. At this\nmoment, a mysterious figure suddenly\nappeared above. Voice carrying a hint of\nlaughter. Is this the 10,000 thunder\nslaughter array map? Not bad. It can\nactually absorb dark clouds. This\nformation can make my power increase\nrapidly. Seeing this, the towist\nimmediately shouted vigilantly, \"Hey,\nwho are you? If you have no business\nhere, get lost.\" The man's eyes flashed\nwith a red light as he looked down\narrogantly, \"Who I am is not important.\nHowever, my coming here this time is to\nfind you for something. The towist heard\nthis and asked with some suspicion,\n\"Impossible. Do we know each other? What\nbusiness does your excellency have with\nme?\" He suddenly thought of something,\nhis mouth gaping in surprise, \"Wait,\ncould you be?\" The man walked up to the\ntowist and said directly, \"I came\nspecifically to borrow something from\nyou.\" He stepped back vigilantly and\nasked, \"What do you want to borrow?\" The\nman immediately swung his fist to\nattack. Borrow your dog life. The towist\nreacted quickly, dodging it and gritted\nhis teeth, cursing, \"Bastard! Do you\nknow who I am?\" Daring to act recklessly\ninside my grand formation. \"Go to hell!\"\nIn an instant, the towist threw a palm\nstrike, forcing the man back, the towist\nsuddenly felt a familiar aura radiating\nfrom him and widen his eyes. \"What this\naura? Who exactly are you?\" The man\ngritted his teeth, enduring, then opened\nhis eyes the next second, laughing\nmadly. I am a Hadu war god duong deni\nthe very duong den tien guarding this\nemperor star. I am the great demon duong\nden tien. Heavenly demon chaotic origin.\nI want to defy the heavens. Heavenly\ndemon 13 forms burial as duong deni\nspoke. He raised both hands to\naccumulate spiritual power. A terrifying\naura spreading out. The tauist was\nterrified to the extreme. What? He tried\nto support his body muttering. Damn it.\nIf I die, the teleportation formation\nwill be destroyed. Duong deni panted on\nthe side. Huff huff huff. The next\nsecond, he looked up at the sky and\nlaughed loudly. Haha. From today\nonwards, I Duong deni can be reborn.\nElsewhere, Hong Tin heard the news. His\nface panicked and unbelieving. What did\nyou say? Tramac killed all of them? Is\nhe that strong? A man stood with hands\non hips looking at Hong Tien, saying,\n\"It seems we must ask the sect for help.\nsend more powerful senior brothers or\nelders over here. Hong Tien frowned,\nurging anxiously. Then what are you\nwaiting for? Hurry up and invite them\nover. The man pretended to be in deep\nthought and said, \"We need a lot of jade\ncontaining spiritual energy to solve the\nimmediate urgency. We also need 300\nvirgin boys and girls to use for setting\nup the formation.\" Hong Tien agreed\ndirectly without hesitation. Elder, rest\nassured. As long as you have a request,\nI will agree to anything. Immediately\nafter, Hong Tien began to act. The army\nentered Hadu, starting to use violence\nto arrest virgin boys and girls. Hadu\nfell into chaos. The heart-wrenching\ncries of mothers echoed throughout the\napartment building. Help! My child, let\nmy child go. Uh, my son is still small.\nAfterward, they took all the children to\nthe 10,000 Thunderl Slaughter Grand\nFormation in Meow Gian. That elder sat\nin the helicopter cabin seeing a bolt of\nlightning strike down and was\nimmediately terrified. What is happening\nthis power? Is it senior brother? Tramac\nrushed up to stop him shouting, \"Are you\ncrazy?\" Zoom jing. There are children\ninside. You can't do this. Duong din\ntien's body stiffened hesitatingly\nsaying, \"Who are you, Tramac?\" Seeing\nTranmac block his attack, Duong Den\nimmediately flew into a rage. Tranmac,\nyou dare to stop the battle between me\nand the Tinlon sect? Then come and fight\nme, Duong Denten. Let's see if your\ngolden core is formidable. Or if my\ndemon core is a level higher, seeing him\nblinded by anger, Tranmack had a rush\nforward, trying to wake him up. Duong\nDen Tien stopped. Don't let anger\ncontrol you. Seeing it still had no\neffect, Tranmack rolled up his sleeves,\nthinking, \"Since it's like this, I can\nonly deal with you myself.\" Duong Den\nTien launched a move, thunder roar,\nlightning flash. Tranmack looked at the\ndescending lightning bolts, channeling\nspiritual power to resist, but it was\nall in vain. After that, those lightning\nbolts gathered in his hand into a ball\nof lightning. Duong Den Tien turned pale\nwith fright, not expecting him to be\nable to control lightning. But Duong Den\nTien thought, \"Don't think only you\ncould do it controlling lightning. I can\ndo it, too.\" Immediately, Duong Denten\nonce again deployed the 10,000 thunder\nslaughter grand formation. 10,000\nlightning bolts converged. A ball of\nlightning with a terrifying aura formed.\nDuong Denten looked provocatively at\nTramac. Well, then dare to block this\nmove of mine. Tranmack didn't even\nbother paying attention to Duong Denten.\nHe looked toward the airplanes. Hurry up\nwhile they are fighting. Everyone\nquickly leave here. He landed on an\nairplane without hesitation. His eyes\nfull of killing intent. \"Want to leave?\nDon't even think about it.\" I said,\n\"People of the Tinlon sect, I won't\nspare a single one.\" Witnessing this\nscene, those people thought that meeting\nTranac meant certain death. They\ntrembling and begging, \"Grandmaster TR,\ndon't kill us. Please give us a chance.\nWe are willing to help you control the\nwhole world. You are the master of this\nworld.\" Tranm did not show mercy. He\nchanneled spiritual energy into his\nfist, looking at them and slowly said,\n\"I don't need you people. You can go die\nnow. The rest of you gathered together\nfor me.\" That ball of lightning\ncontrolled all of the tin lawn sex\nairplanes. The people inside were in a\npanic. What's happening? The plane lost\ncontrol. All aircraft functions are\nparalyzed. The plane shook violently.\nPeople of the tin lawn sect inside the\ncabin rolled around like balls, crying\nmiserably. Help! We're dead for sure.\nTramac doesn't want to let us escape.\nTranmack shouted threats to the\nhijackers on the plane from the outside.\nListen, protect the children on the\nplane. Well, if anything happens to\nthem, I Tranmac will definitely hack you\nall into pieces. A pilot in the cockpit\nheardly stepped forward to guarantee. I\nwill definitely protect these children.\nWell, absolutely will not let them\nsuffer any harm. The people inside\ndirectly comforted the captured\nchildren. You children rest assured we\nwon't hurt you. over here. Duong Dinti\nwith crazy eyes, sneered at him. Tramac,\nhave you forgotten everything? Tramac\nheard Duong Dent Tien's voice, turned\nabruptly, frowned, and said, \"Why are\nyou still here? Is there something\nelse?\" Duong Denten heard this, stopped\nbeating around the bush, released a\nlightning bolt to declare war. You want\nto duel with me, but still dare to be\ndistracted by other people's business?\nCome, proceed with the final duel.\nBefore Tranmac could agree, Duong Denten\nhad already rushed forward madly,\nattacking with all his might. I want to\nsee if he can withstand my 10,000\nthunders unity palm. Kill Tramac over\nhere. Tramac also began to condense a\nhuge ball of energy. His eyes\ndetermined. Duong deni today. I will let\nyou know I Tranmac am forever a high\nmountain that you cannot reach. In an\ninstant, two powerful streams of\nspiritual energy collided violently.\nSparks flew. A powerful aura covered the\nentire space. In a corner of the sky,\ntwo streams of spiritual energy with\nterrible destructive power spread out.\nThe people of Tinlon sect in a violently\nshaking airplane exclaimed, \"Sit tight.\nThe aftershock might blow us away. The\ndestructive power is too strong. The\nlight is too blinding.\" Suddenly, the\nairplanes slowly landed on the ground.\nThe crowd stirred, speculating. The\nplane landed. Did Tramac do it to\nprotect us from being affected? Everyone\nstepped off the plane. A person ran\nover, pointed to a corner of the sky.\nEveryone look over there. This is truly\nGod's fighting. Look at Duong Denten. He\nhas very likely entered the devil path.\nAfter entering the devil path, a demon\nwill be extremely powerful and\nbloodthirsty by nature. If Grandmaster\nTran cannot control him, will he destroy\nthe world? Everyone watch the battle\nwhile clasping their hands in prayer.\nGrandmaster Tran, come on. Defeat Duong\nDien. Duong Dint Tien completely lost\nhis reason. He arrogantly looked at\nTranmac and declared, \"Tranmac, today I\nwon't let you know one thing. I, Duong\nDenten, am forever the strongest war god\nin this world.\" Tranmac's eyes were\ncold. He swung a fist at him. War god.\nThis world has no war god with such\nsoaring killing intent as you. Duong\ndinten, why don't you look back at this\nworld? This is the world that gave birth\nto and nurtured you. How can you bear to\ndestroy it? Having said that, Duong\nDenten was knocked to the ground by a\nblow. He lay motionless, laughing madly.\nHaha. All weaklings are not worthy of\nbeing human. D. All of you. D. I want\nthis whole world to be buried with my\nDuong family. A light flashed in\nTramax's eyes. Old memories rushing\nback. Unexpectedly, Duong Den Tien\nturned into this state. Before I let him\ncome here to destroy the teleportation\nformation, thinking his mind was stable,\nit turned out he was pretending. After\nobtaining the 10,000 Thunderl Slaughter\nGrand Formation, his strength increased\ngreatly, only now revealing his sharp\nclaws. I could have killed him directly,\nbut I pity his power. Being able to\nattract a heavenly tribulation when\nbreaking through to the golden core is\nabsolutely not simple. Suddenly, a bold\nidea flashed in Tranmax's mind. Subdue\nhim as a servant. This is the demon\nbinding curse used by him and his junior\nsister in his previous life when\ncapturing spirit beasts. Duong Din Tien\nrefused to admit defeat, he rushed\nforward. Tranmac, go to hell. Tranmack\ndid not fight back, only defended.\nSeeing Duong Din Tin knocked back, he\ncalculated in his heart, quietly\ncompleting the restriction. No matter\nhow strong the beast is, it can only\nwait for death. Just as Duong Denten\nprepared to attack again, Tran Mack\nturned and ran. Duong Denten thought he\nhad won, smiled smugly. What? Haha. Want\nto run already? You disappoint me too\nmuch. Today you're dead for sure. Before\nthe words were finished, a restriction\nappeared behind his back. Duong Denten\nwas controlled, frowned angrily. What is\nthis? Feeling something moving inside\nthe body. What exactly did you do to me?\nTranmax stood quietly to one side,\nwatching him gradually being pierced by\nspiritual energy, screaming and\nstruggling in pain. It hurts so much.\nTranmax stood by and observed, thinking,\n\"At this moment, his body must feel like\nit's being bitten by thousands of ants,\nnot only biting the flesh, but also\ngnawing at the soul. I originally wanted\nto befriend you, but you have entered\nthe devil path. For the sake of this\nworld, I am forced to subdue you.\" Duong\nDin Tin gritted his teeth, his eyes full\nof unwillingness, but still said,\n\"Tranmac, I I admit defeat.\" He withdrew\nthe restriction, coldly said, \"Call me\nmaster. From today onwards, you are the\nservant of I, Tramac. The day you\nconquer your inner demons, you will\nregain your freedom.\" Duong Deni was\ndefeated. Could only kneel before him,\nstammering, \"Yes, thank you, Moss.\nMaster.\" Hong Tian paced in the room,\nscratching his head and muttering, \"What\nto do?\" Tramac is about to kill his way\nto the door. Manu entered. She said\nangrily. What's the rush? Our son died\nand I didn't see you this frantic. Hong\nTien heard this, turned abruptly, roared\nwith an anxious face. Can state affairs\nbe compared to this? This matter\nconcerns the survival of our Hong\nfamily. She rested her chin on her hand,\nlooking at him mockingly. And your\nfamily? It's just for yourself. Don't\ntalk about family. Even your own father\nyou could lay a hand on. What are you\npretending for? Hong Tien heard her\nmention Elder Hong, craned his neck and\nsaid, \"My father was killed by you. That\ncloak with the tracking device was given\nto my father by you.\" Manu frowned and\nshouted, \"It was you who gave it to me.\nNow you have the face to blame me. Isn't\nit because you were oppressed by that\npowerful father for so many years?\nCouldn't take it anymore.\" Hong Tan\ndenied it profusely. He craned his neck\nand screamed, \"It wasn't me. It wasn't\nme. My father was killed by you. Today I\nmust avenge my father. Immediately\nafter, Hong Tin grabbed Manu's neck,\nsqueezed hard until her face turned\npurple. Manu stared in horror, making\nsounds. Ugg. The noise stopped. Manu lay\nmotionless on the floor. Hong looked at\nhis trembling hands, stammering. Ah.\nOutside the door, his subordinate\npanicked and ran in, stammering. Moss,\nmaster, I heard arguing. Is madam. Hong\nTien still hadn't recovered. A moment\nlater, he turned his head, revealing an\nevil smile. Madam, Madam is asleep. Help\nme help her back to the room, obeying\nhis order. Manu was taken back to the\nroom. Honen sat on the edge of the bed,\nlooking at the cold corpse, and said,\n\"Shia knew, you were right. I shouldn't\nbe impatient. What's the hurry? This\nmatter is seamless. Now, we are finally\nabout to trample the whole world under\nour feet. However, you must bless me.\nBless that the bastard Tranmack gets\nkilled by the experts of the cultivation\nworld.\" He placed his hand on Manu's\nGlabella. The next second, she opened\nher eyes, glanced at him with disdain,\nopened her mouth, and said, \"Usually you\nlook like an honest old buffalo.\" But\nafter a long time, I realized you were\nmore like a wolf. Hong Tien's face\nturned pale, Manu. You You weren't dead.\nHe stood up in panic, looking at Manu.\nImpossible. You were clearly dead. How\ncould you come back to life? He pulled\nout a knife, stabbed straight at her,\nhis voice full of crazy malice. Why come\nback to life? You are not human. Manu\nwatched a series of actions, coldly said\nword by word. You are the one who is not\nhuman. She sat on the bed, calmly\nunleashed a killing move. Hong Tien\ndidn't even have time to act. He\ncollapsed on the floor. A stream of evil\nenergy spread and Duong Den Tian's soul\nemerged from Anu's body. He happily\nwatched these two villains slaughter\neach other. This world never belonged to\nyou. Finally, I have avenged myself.\nHonien lay on the ground weakly opening\nhis eyes. Duong Denten, it's you. Duong\nDenten crossed his arms over his chest,\nkilling intent flashing in his eyes. Let\nme use devil fire to send you off. Go\ndown to hell and reunite with your wife.\nThe scene shifted to Tien's son. Tranmax\nstood by the cliff in deep thought. The\nreason the Tinlon sect came to this\nworld turned out to be for the dragon\nvein of the emperor's seat star. He\nclosed his eyes. A map appeared in his\nmind. Let me see what's strange. This is\nthe dragon vein. No, this is not a\nnormal dragon vein. An expert has\nrefined the dragon vein of the whole\nworld into a complete dragon vein\nessence. He suddenly realized his brows\nfurrowed tightly, muttering to himself.\nSuch heaven-deying means. Unfortunately,\nit failed. If successful, I'm afraid\nthis world would have many immortal\nemperors. He used light body technique.\nrush straight down into a stone cave\nentrance, thinking, \"How can I revive\nthis dragon vein essence that has its\nvitality cut off?\" If you don't enter\nthe tiger's den, how can you catch the\ntiger cub? Let's just look at the dragon\nvein first, then decide. Tranmack went\ndeep into the cave. A dragon head\nappeared before his eyes. This is the\ncenter of the TN sun dragon vein. He\napproached that dragon head to\ninvestigate. The next second, he sensed\nsomething abnormal. This dragon vein was\nalmost like an extremely powerful\nmagnet. As soon as spiritual energy\nappeared, it would absorb it all. No\nwonder the spiritual energy on the\nemperor's seat star was so thin. If this\ndragon vein could not be revived, he\nfeared all spiritual energy would be\nsucked dry by it. By then, the emperor\nseat star would be devoid of vitality\nand likely all living beings on the\nplanet would perish. Thinking of this,\nhe immediately launched a strike at that\ndragon head. Heaven slashing sword open\nfor me. However, that dragon head\nremained unharmed, which terrified him.\nThis heaven slashing sword had been\ntempered by the ninecoled heavenly\nthunder and was terrifyingly powerful.\nUnexpectedly, it had no effect at all.\nJust then, a strange voice rang out.\nYoung man, relying solely on your\nstrength to break the shell of the\ndragon vein, is truly daydreaming.\nTranmack asked vigilantly, \"Who are\nyou?\" Strangely, no one appeared. Yet\nthe voice continued to echo. Eternal and\nleisurely sand of the desert,\nthousand-year tribulation, 10,000-year\nhardship, forever immortal. I am a human\nemperor. Tranmack looked around wearily,\nshouting suspiciously. In the long\nhistory of the emperor's seat star, who\ndoesn't know the great name of human\nemperor Fushi? To think I would meet you\nhere. Are you really Fushi? What proof\ndo you have? The voice spoke slowly\nagain. It's a long story. Years ago, my\nwife Nua, five good friends, and I\nexplored the eye of the universe in the\nancient forbidden land, but I was\nheavily injured there. Afterwards, I\nreturned to the Emperor's Seat Star, but\ncould not contact my wife and France. I\nappeared today because I want to ask you\nto help me with something. As for proof,\nbefore the words were finished, a\nbrilliant light flashed between the\neyebrows of the dragon head. Tramac\nexclaimed in surprise, \"That is the Heat\ntoo.\" A He too appeared. The mysterious\nperson confirmed. Correct. Years ago, a\ndragon horse carrying the map appeared\non the yellow river and I obtained it.\nDo you know the origin of the Heat Too?\nTramac hesitated slightly and answered,\n\"Could it be that the Heto comes from\nthe eye of the universe?\" The person\nreplied, \"Correct. The Heto and Lu Shoe\nare both extraordinary treasures. When I\nwas in the eye of the universe in the\nancient forbidden land, I sensed an aura\nsimilar to the Heto and Luo Shu. I\nsearched alone but couldn't even break\nthe outer restrictions. So I called my\nwife Nua to help break the formation.\nThere was one final formation left that\ncouldn't be solved. So I invited the\nfive direction great emperors. The seven\nof us joined forces to break this final\nformation. But upon entering the eye of\nthe universe, we were heavily injured by\na terrifying existence. I could only\nflee in panic. Tranmack crossed his arms\nand looked at the he thinking to\nhimself. Years ago, my little junior\nsister and I went to investigate the eye\nof the universe precisely because of the\nabnormal fluctuations there. It turns\nout it was the great battle between\nFushi and that taboo entity. Thinking\nback now, Fushi was very likely the\nculprit leading to the death of myself\nand my little junior sister. That\nmotionless dragon Vain suddenly emitted\na ray of light. The person moved, his\nvoice somewhat deep. Years ago, I was\nheavily injured and had to return to the\nEmperor's Sea Star, borrowing the dragon\nvein to recover my strength. But\nunexpectedly, this dragon vein developed\na consciousness, and its cultivation was\nactually no weaker than mine at my peak.\nAfter a bitter battle, I could only use\nmy life origin to enter the dragon vein\nand seal it, preventing this beast from\ndirectly destroying the emperor's seat\nstar. Tranmack narrowed his eyes,\nsomewhat confused. Did you not think at\nthat time that if you absorb the\nemperor's seat stars dragon vein, the\nwhole world would be destroyed due to\nthe dragon vein drying up? The\nmysterious person finally appeared.\nHuman Emperor Fushi sat there with a\ncalm expression. I never thought of\nabsorbing the entire dragon vein. I only\nwanted to borrow the dragon vein to\nquickly recover from my injuries and go\nfind my wife Nua. I am to blame for\nstubbornly doing things my way, forcibly\ngathering the dragon vein, which led to\nme being trapped by it and the emperor\nseat stars spiritual energy being\nexhausted because of me. I am a sinner\nof the emperor seat star. Tranmax saw\nthe old man clearly feeling a bit\nsurprised in his heart. Is this the true\nappearance of Fushi? Why is there an\noppressive feeling under this ordinary\nand kind face that makes me unable to\nbreathe? But he quickly recovered his\nsenses. looking at Fushi. Then do you\nhave a way for the dragon vein to emit\nspiritual energy again? The old man\npondered for a moment before replying. I\ndo, but I need your help. Tranmack\nhurriedly and tactfully refused. I am\njust a small cultivator who has just\nentered the golden core realm. How can I\nhelp you? Fushi, however, seemed to take\nit for granted. Speaking slowly, all\nthings in the world have a destiny. Your\nrebirth on the emperor's seat star is\ndestiny, including our meeting today,\nwhich is also destiny. Tranmack was\nhorrified. This person actually knew he\nwas a reincarnator. The next second, he\nstared blankly at the lines on his palm,\nfalling into deep thought. I originally\nthought I accidentally reincarnated on\nthe emperor's seat star. Could it be\nthat it wasn't a coincidence? Fushi and\nNua searched for the eye of the universe\ntogether. After being injured, he hit on\nthe emperor's seat star and gathered the\ndragon vein, causing the emperor's seat\nstars spiritual energy to dry up.\nUnknown years later, I Tranmac was born,\ntaken in as a disciple by the east\nflower immortal emperor and went missing\nwhile searching for the eye of the\nuniverse with my little junior sister\nLackly. After reincarnating, I met the\nhuman emperor Fushi, whom I had never\nmet back then. This feeling is like life\nwas originally a straight line, but\nsomeone pulled it back to a starting\npoint to begin again and then another\nstraight line emerged. Fushi waited for\nhim to finish thinking before slowly\nspeaking. In your past life, we missed\neach other and you were taken in as a\ndisciple by the East Flower immortal\nemperor. But in this life, I met you\nfirst. This is destiny and you are the\nperson I've been waiting for for many\nyears. Hearing this, the image of the\neast flower immortal emperor appeared in\nTrrammax's mind. He frowned and thought,\n\"If following the trajectory of the\nprevious life, 5 years from now, I will\nbe taken in as a disciple by the east\nflower immortal emperor. So now, will he\nstill come to the emperor's seat star?\nWill I still be able to meet my little\njunior sister?\" But he still firmly\nrefused. Even if I am the person you are\nwaiting for, I will not help you. What\nif I die again this time? I'm afraid I\nwill never see my little junior sister\nagain. Fushi was not in a hurry upon\nhearing this and began to pinch his\nfingers to calculate Tranmax's destiny.\nTranmack raised his eyebrows. Hm, what\nare you doing? Fushi replied while\npinching his fingers. I am looking at\nyour future destiny. A moment later, his\npupils dilated, looking somewhat\nsurprised, and he sighed. Sigh. Sure\nenough, the U of the present is no\nlonger the you of that year. Your\ndestiny is a chaotic mess. Even I cannot\nsee through your fate. Hearing this,\nTranmax's brows involuntarily furrowed.\nIn other words, you also cannot\nguarantee that I can survive. Then I\ndefinitely cannot help you. Fushi spoke\nagain, poking at his sore spot. But I\ncan see the destiny of your little\njunior sister. Tranmack excitedly\nstepped forward, grabbed his collar, and\nasked urgently, \"What? You can see the\ndestiny of my little junior sister? How\nis she now? Where is she?\" Fushi looked\nup at him and said slowly, \"She once\ncame to the emperor's seat, start to\nlook for you.\" But she reincarnated into\nancient times and was called the goddess\nLuo by the people of that time. And at\nthat time you were not yet born. When\nshe reincarnated the spiritual energy of\nthe emperor seat star was already very\nthin. So the east flower immortal\nemperor took her away from the emperor\nseat star. Tramac did not believe it.\nIf junior sister also reincarnated, she\nwould definitely remember me. She\ncouldn't just leave like that. Fushi\ncontinued. She established the snow god\npalace, wanting to wait for you to be\ntogether after you ascended. That was\nthe love nest she built for the two of\nyou. Tranmack clenched his fists and\nasked, \"Then why did she leave? Why\ndidn't she wait for me in the\ncultivation world, but wanted to leave\nagain? Why?\" Fushi shrugged, looking at\nhim calmly. \"The gears of fate have\nturned and everyone's destiny has\nchanged. You're no longer the you of\nbefore, and lack is no longer the lack\nof before.\" Tran Mack gritted his teeth,\nmuttering, \"What?\" Fushi looked at his\ndazed appearance and laughed twice. Did\nyou think that after you reincarnated,\nother people's destinies wouldn't change\nat all? Think about your parents and\nfriends. Think about your opponents and\nlook at yourself. You have changed and\nthis whole world has also changed.\nTranmack was unwilling to accept it, a\nglimmer of hope still flashing in his\neyes. Then is my little junior sister\nstill my little junior sister? Fushi\nreplied regretfully. If the heart is\ndead, then she is not. If the heart is\nalive, then there is hope in everything.\nCan't you meet your little junior sister\nagain and make her become your lover\nonce more? Hearing this, Tranmax\nsuddenly realized. Tranmack made up his\nmind. That's right. In this life, I want\nto personally go find my little junior\nsister. What was I desparing about just\nnow? After that, he bowed respectfully\nto human emperor Fushi and said, \"Thank\nyou, human emperor, for your guidance. I\nunderstand now.\" The old man nodded\nkindly. \"Yes, yes.\" After expressing his\nthanks, Tranmack hurriedly turned to\nleave. Then I will go first. Take care.\nI will come to visit you again later. He\nwaved at Fushi, thinking to himself.\nAfter returning, I must find a way to\nrepair the space teleportation\nformation, go to the snow god palace to\nsearch for traces of my little junior\nsister, and also work hard on\ncultivation to make myself stronger.\nJust as he was excitedly making plans,\nFushi's gentle voice rang out again.\nTranmack, sorry I have dragged you into\nthis. You cannot leave. Tranmack tilted\nhis head, stunned. Can't leave. Fushi\npinched his fingers again and continued.\nJust now, I peaked into the heavenly\nsecret. The destinies of both you and\nLack lie are extremely chaotic. You\nshould also know the principle that\nheavenly secrets cannot be revealed. He\nsuddenly covered his mouth and coughed a\nfew times. Speaking with difficulty.\nCough, cough, cough. I told you so much.\nMy body was already heavily injured and\nI'm afraid I don't have much time left.\nTranmack opened his mouth wide, a look\nof gratitude appearing in his eyes. It\nturns out he became weak enough to cough\nup blood because he helped me peek into\nthe heavenly secret. Tranmax stepped\nforward again, hesitating. Senior I,\nFushi wave his hand, stood up straight,\nand looked at him with trusting eyes.\nIt's okay. I've been trapped here for a\nlong time, and my body was damaged long\nago. Even if I didn't help you peek into\nthe heavenly secret, I wouldn't live\nmuch longer. Now it's just a bit sooner.\nBut if I die, this dragon vein with\nspiritual consciousness will have no one\nto guard it, and the emperor's seat star\nwill perish. By then, no one will\nsurvive on this beautiful planet. Trer's\nseat star. It seemed Fushi had placed\nall hope on him. Tranmack opened his\nmouth, then froze, not knowing what to\nsay. He organized the information in his\nmind. If I leave, the dragon vein\nrevives and everyone will die. But if I\nstay here, I might die. But the\nemperor's seat star will have a glimmer\nof survival. Tranmax sighed, secretly\nmaking up his mind, slapped his chest,\nand shouted, \"Damn it. Consider Tranax\nbad luck to be born this way. I'll help.\nAll right. Consider this a debt you owe\nme.\" Fushi stroked his white beard,\nnodding, \"Yes, this is what I owe you\nand also what I owe this whole world.\nFinally, I want to give you a meeting\ngift, which is also a parting gift.\nThese two books are my Fushi's original\nsource. Since I was born until now, they\nhave never left my person. Today, I give\nthem to you. Consider it my repayment of\nthis kindness. Immediately after, two\nprecious books fell onto his head.\nTramac was overwhelmed by the favor,\nshocked in his heart. It's the real\nriver map and Lu Shu. The first and\nsecond treasures among Fushi's eight\ntreasures are now mine. He stammered,\nasking. You are really giving such\nprecious items to me. Fushi immediately\ncorrected, not giving it his\ncompensation. Tranmack, having gained an\nadvantage, immediately looked at the\nelder with a determined smile. All\nright, I, Tran Mack, will help with your\nmatter. Fushi felt a bit more at ease\nhearing this, saying the final words,\n\"The power of this dragon vein is\nextremely strong. My body can no longer\nwithstand its spiritual consciousness.\nTherefore, you need to absorb it into\nyour body. I will come to help you\nrefine it. The dragon vein will no\nlonger have spiritual consciousness and\ncan fill this world with spiritual\nenergy. Emperor Seed Star will restore\nits former glory. Tranmack pointed at\nhimself, hurriedly confirming me. I come\nto accept the dragon vain. Are you\nkidding? Do you feel that's possible?\nFushi replied without hesitation. I have\nlooked into it. The possibility is very\nhigh. The success rate is over 1 in\n10,000. Tran Mack let out a cold laugh,\nshouting excitedly. How much? One in\n10,000. You call this very high. Then he\ncalmed down, resting his chin in deep\nthought. Is this probability any\ndifferent from seeking death? But I have\nno choice. However, one in 10,000 is\nstill a glimmer of hope. No other way.\nAfter comforting himself a bit, he\nshouted loudly, gathering all his\ncourage. Risk it all. Then I'm starting.\nFushi smiled with satisfaction,\npraising. You have guts. The matters\nafter this I entrust to you. Uh-uh.\nBattle four directions. Conquer eight\nseas. The universe completely\nextinguishes a single point of light.\nAmidst the solemn voice, powerful\nspiritual energy wrapped around\nTranmax's body. He sensed the\nsurroundings, thinking to himself, \"The\nspace around me is about to be covered\nby his power.\" On the other side, the\ndragon vein took form, its eyes cold,\nhand holding a blade, body clad in\narmor, blood splashing eight feet.\nOutside Tion Shawn, a dazzling pillar of\nlight shot straight into the clouds with\nimmense power. Looking at the blue\npillar of light shooting straight into\nthe sky. Residents in the city discussed\nanimatedly. Look quickly. There's a beam\nof light in the sky. So beautiful. Even\nmore beautiful than the Milky Way. Is\nthat divine light? People from the\nresearch institute were busy because of\nthis exchanging with each other. Is the\nenergy in the light pillar stable? Does\nit have any impact on the world? A\nreporter from station x.x was reporting\nat the scene. Where exactly does this\nlight pillar come from? What should\nhumanity do? Do we need to prepare to\nwelcome the apocalypse? Just then,\neveryone discovered a creature. Look\nquickly. There's a dragon in the light\npillar. Truly magnificent. Is this\nultimately a good omen or a bad omen?\nInside Tion Shawn, Tran Mack jumped\ndown, landing on the dragon's foot,\nsuddenly thinking uneasily, what is\nhappening. The main body inside the\nmountain is trembling. It doesn't mean\nit wants to rush out, does it? Suddenly,\nan explosion occurred where the giant\ndragon was an energy pillar shot up to\nthe sky. Tranmack shouted loudly. Oh my\ngod. Heaven collapsing and earth\nsplitting. Why is there suddenly a\ndragon? Tranmack continued to roar.\nFushi, what are you doing this? Where is\nthis? Don't release the dragon vein. At\nthis moment, Fushi appeared from behind\nhim, saying to him, don't panic. This is\nmy soul sea. I have pulled it into the\nsoul sea. As long as we can control it,\nthis whole world will be safe and sound.\nHearing this, he hesitated, saying, \"But\nmy current strength.\" The old man\npointed to where he appeared and said,\n\"In here, I can lend you my power so we\ncan deal with this evil dragon\ntogether.\" Trax said decisively, \"All\nright, at this moment, the place where\nhe stood shook.\" Tranmac vigilantly\nthought, \"What is this? Could it be\nseaater? No, this is pure energy.\"\nAfterward, he felt the power gradually\nbecoming stronger. Golden core stage,\nnaent soul stage, soul formation realm,\nvoid amalgamation realm. My cultivation\nbase is still increasing, about to\nundergo heavenly tribulation to become\nan immortal venerable. I feel infinite\npower within my body. Plucking stars and\nseizing the moon is as easy as turning\nover a hand. I can clearly see every\ncorner of this world along with the\nsuffering of humanity. Above Tramac was\na globe. There he saw someone speaking.\nEveryone retreat. Elderly and children\nquickly retreat to the back. Seeing\nthis, he thought, \"It seems disaster has\ndescended upon my home.\" Next, he\nsuddenly appeared in front of his\nrelatives, saying, \"Dad, mom, Quinton,\nTran Tong 2, don't be afraid. I am\nhere.\" Tran tongue too shouted with\noverwhelming joy, \"Master! It's&lt;unk&gt;s\nmaster coming to save us.\" Duong Din\nTien saw him, muttering in surprise,\n\"Tranmac, perhaps I will never be able\nto surpass this young man.\" The great\nchief supported by him also opened his\nmouth, \"Is this the power of a god?\"\nTranmac, do you want to become the god\nof this whole world? Fushi stood behind,\nstroking his beard, saying, \"I already\nsaid just kill the dragon veins\nspiritual consciousness and you can save\nthe whole world. You need to focus your\npower on fighting. Don't waste it here.\nTranax said firmly. This is the world\nwhere I was born. How can I bear to\nwatch it be destroyed? Saving one person\nis one person. I don't want anyone else\nto die. The old man had no other way.\nHad to go along with him, saying,\n\"You're truly soft-hearted. Right now, I\nneed you to deal with the dragon veins\nspiritual consciousness, and that's it.\nMy power is also limited.\" Tramax said\nconfidently, \"Rest assured, I am here.\"\nFushi asked in panic. Tranmack, what do\nyou want to do? Tranmack gave a loud\nshout, holding the sword and rushing\nout, saying, \"Of course, it's the head.\"\nTrime straight for the giant dragon's\nhead to attack. Then he fell in a deep\nthought. \"No way, not even a scratch.\"\nThe giant dragon extended a claw,\nwanting to catch him. Luckily, Tranmack\ndodged in time. Next, Tran Mack\ncontinuously launched moves. Heaven\nprofound divine palm. Heaven defying\nseven steps. Nirvana great divine\nability. Fushi seeing this said\nhelplessly, \"This brat really doesn't\nlet people worry less.\" Told him to be\nan assistant for me. Yet he rushed up by\nhimself. Immediately thinking, \"However,\nyou alone cannot defeat the giant\ndragon.\" Next, he didn't think much\nanymore. Flew forward, saying, \"It's\nbeen hard on you. Watch me.\" Emperor\ndescends upon the world. A stream of\nlightning-shaped energy appeared on\nFushi's hand, immediately rushing\nstraight towards the giant dragon. The\ngiant dragon groaned in pain. Ugh. Ah.\nBut Fushi panicked, thinking, \"Damn it.\nMy power is far inferior to before. It\ncan break free at any time, but it still\nsuffered a bit of influence from that\nlightning move.\" The giant dragon\nimmediately wanted to flee. Tranmax\nshouted loudly. \"It's about to pierce\nthrough the barrier.\" Fushi hurriedly\nsaid, \"Quickly, chase. Cannot let it\nleave my soul. See, otherwise, we will\nno longer have the ability to defeat it.\nKill it right in the universe. It's\nswinging its tail, causing many\nmeteorites to fall. Fushi rushed up\nfirst, saying, then used full force to\nblock the meteorites. I'll block them\nquickly chase after it. I have my own\nway to deal with it. Tranmack thought to\nhimself, his body gradually changing\naccordingly. Seems like I have to turn\ngiant, otherwise I basically can't catch\nit. Luckily, a moment later, he\nsuccessfully jumped onto the giant\ndragon, breathing a sigh of relief,\nsaying, \"Caught it.\" Then he thought,\n\"Just hanging on like this seems very\nstrenuous.\" From behind came a shout,\n\"Tramac, move out away a bit.\" He he\nfushi controlled the meteorites from\njust now, flying straight into the giant\ndragon's face with alarming speed. The\ngiant dragon shook for a while, flinging\nhim away. Tramax shouted, \"Not good.\" In\nthe giant dragon's mouth condensed an\nenergy ball, opening its mouth to attack\ntowards him. Tramac was knocked flying,\ngroaning in pain. Then he suddenly\nrealized something, turning his head to\nlook back, thinking that is the planet\nbehind has the aura of little junior\nsister. Meanwhile, the giant dragon was\nstill chasing him, emitting a low roar.\nNo, don't harm little junior sister. At\nthis moment, an entity wrapped around\nhim. The giant dragon and Fushi were\nboth stunned to the point of being\ndazed, thinking too terrifying. Inside\nTramac body, there is actually such\npowerful strength. He lay paralyzed on\nthe ground, mouth spurting fresh blood.\nFushi rushed over, asking worriedly,\n\"It's merely a planet. Moreover, it's\nnot Emperor's Seat Star. Is it worth you\nusing your life to block?\" He looked\ntowards that planet, saying firmly, \"I\ncan feel my little junior sister is\nthere.\" Tranmack in this life will\nabsolutely not let her suffer any harm\nagain. At this moment, the giant dragon\nhad chased up and emitted a roar. Fushi\nimmediately said, \"Seems there is no\ntime to talk.\" Then he made up his mind.\nOnly this way remains. Tramac, the rest\nrelies on you. Then he flew towards the\ngiant dragon, bidding him, farewell. I'm\ngoing. Fushi clasped his hands, shouting\nloudly, using my original source to\nsuppress your spiritual consciousness.\nEternal existence through the ages,\nundying for eternity. Fushi's long hair\nwrapped around its body. Fushi said the\nfinal sentence. Seal spiritual\nconsciousness. The giant dragon roared\nuncomfortably. Fushi instructed\nTranmack. Tranmack, listen. Now I have\nlocked my divine consciousness and its\ndivine consciousness together. Quickly\nkill it. Tramac thought. Fushi's divine\nconsciousness and the dragon veins\ndivine consciousness are bound together.\nIf I kill it then then he shouted\nloudly. No, cannot. Then wouldn't you\nalso die? I cannot do that. Fushi calmly\nsaid to Tracultivators\ncannot be trapped by emotions. me in\nthis world which is light and which is\nheavy. Can you not distinguish? Quickly\ntake action. He dared not believe what\nhe heard. Thinking clearly the person\nwho put the most affection into this\nworld is you. You are willing to\nsacrifice your life in exchange for the\nsafety of this planet. Yet I have to\nkill a good person like you with my own\nhands. I'm still Fushi said regretfully.\nThis beast was created by me. It is my\nkarmic obstacle. Let me repay it. Then\nhe urged him quickly take action.\nTranmack turned his head away hesitating\nsaying then I really Fushi said another\nsentence a manly man don't hesitate like\nthat come here in it all he finally\ndecided to take action ha nirvana great\ndivine ability golden light illuminated\nall four directions followed by green\nlight emitted by the giant dragon it\ngroaned in pain stood beside him bidding\nfarewell just like this I have to go\nTramac didn't know what to say the old\nman asked him for one last thing. If you\ncan meet Nuwa, help me tell her I love\nher. Then Fushi slowly disappeared. He\nhowled, \"Fushi.\" Fushi's remnant\nspiritual consciousness said to Tranmac,\n\"Thank you, Tranmack. I have paid off\nall my debts to this world. You don't\nneed to be sad. Return quickly. You have\none last mission.\" He looked at the\nenergy dissipating from his body,\nthinking to himself, \"The immortal\nvenerables tribulation is complete. The\npower Fukhai gave me is dissipating. I\nstill won't make it to the planet where\nmy little junior's sister is. Then a\nrather dazzling light appeared. The\nlight of the Toa star is beckoning me.\nHe immediately flew towards it. In his\nmind, he was still thinking, \"No, Fukai\"\nsaid, \"I have one last mission. What\nexactly is it? Is there still something\nI need to do on to a star?\" As soon as\nhe got close, he saw a pale yellow light\nappear. He exclaimed in surprise, \"This\nis spiritual energy. Spiritual energy.\nCountless spiritual energy is rushing\ninto my body. Tramax screamed aloud.\nUgg. A. Then when his feet touched the\nground, he released the spiritual energy\nagain, forming a dragon. Huh? Then he\nthought to himself, I have released all\nthe spiritual energy in the dragon vein.\nSpiritual energy. Hurry back to Earth.\nThen as he touched the spiritual energy,\nhe thought, first restore the original\ndragon vein. Then we'll see. Spiritual\nenergy slowly flowed into every corner\nof this place. He breathed a sigh of\nrelief. Continuing to think like this in\nthe future, the Toa star will be able to\npossess abundant ceaseless spiritual\nenergy. Next, I still have to go to\nother places to speed up the process,\nrepairing the landscape of mountains and\nrivers destroyed by the dragon vein\nearlier. When he passed by another\nplace, people on a helicopter saw him\nand said, \"Look quickly. There's a\ndivine dragon passing through the\nvolcano. The lava has stopped. And where\nhe passed, the surrounding people\ncheered. Look quickly. The sky-high\nfloods have receded. Is it a divine\ndragon descending to the world? Is the\ndivine dragon that saved us? He thought\nsorrowfully again. It's a pity I can\nrestore the appearance of the mountains\nand rivers, but I cannot bring the dead\nback to life. Then he remembered that\nelder Fukhai. Suddenly, a sprout emerged\nfrom the ground accompanied by a streak\nof green. he exclaimed in surprise. This\nis spiritual energy continuously surging\nout from within the earth veins. Then he\nsaid happily after Fukhai merged with\nthe dragon vein. The spiritual energy of\nthe Toa star which had been dried up for\nwho knows how many years is finally\nabundant again. Spring has come. The era\nof the Toa stars prosperity has arrived.\nSpiritual energy fell upon everyone.\nThey screamed in wild joy. Haha. I Hong\nLoy have actually cultivated a golden\ncore. I Lancet have also formed a golden\ncore. Duong Dentian, I must kill you. I\nwant revenge. The era of universal\ncultivation has arrived. Among them, one\nperson called his name Tranmac. I\nTrangden am now also a golden core\nexpert. I want to see if you can cover\nthe sky with one hand. First, I'll\ndismantle this Macon of yours. at Makmon\nTran tongue too stroked his beard and\nthought the spiritual energy of DOA star\nhas recovered but I have only broken\nthrough to the peak of the divine realm\nif someone comes to cause trouble at\nthis time I'm afraid before he could\nfinish his sentence at the gate of Mmon\nTrong Den was banging on the door and\nroaring tranmac roll out here for me\ntran tongue two thought speak of\nchowchow and ga the he continued\naggressively tranmac come out I Trangden\nam here to seek revenge on you. Seeing\nthis, Tran Tong too said disdainfully.\nWhere did this arrogant person come from\nthinking that just because your\ncultivation has increased, you're\ninvincible in the world? He said\narrogantly, I've already probed with my\ndivine sense. Your Macon doesn't even\nhave a single golden core. Tiny\ncultivator, don't try to scare me. What\nif you're scared? Then open the door\nquickly. Tran tongue too thought. Master\nhasn't returned yet. I must protect\nMacon well. It seems I can only use the\nheavenly mystic divine fist that master\ntaught me. Then he said just a golden\ncore dares to be so presumptuous. Even\nif my Macmon doesn't have a single\ngolden core expert, it is not a place\nwhere you people can shout and make a\nscene. He raised his hand intending to\nattack Tran Tong 2 shouting arrogantly.\nTrangden is here. D Tran Tongu also\nlaunched an attack. A mountain breaking\nfist struck directly at his face. Trong\nDen's mouth was twisted by this punch,\ngroaning in pain. Then he said in\ndisbelief, \"Impossible, just a divine\nrealm cultivator yet can defeat me with\none palm strike.\" Tran tongue 2\nimmediately said, \"I am Tranmax\ndisciple.\" Outside, a subordinate ran in\npanic to report. Grand Chief, it's\nchaotic outside. Many cultivators\nsuddenly broke through to the golden\ncore stage and started rioting. He asked\nworriedly, \"Then where is Duong Denien?\"\nThe person hurriedly said, \"Duong din\ntien is in seclusion for cultivation.\"\nAnother person ran in and said, \"Grand\nchief, three golden core cultivators\nhave arrived outside.\" Outside, three\nuninvited guests appeared swaggeringly.\nAt this moment, a subordinate said, \"Do\nyou know where this is? If you don't\nleave, we will open fire.\" Then they\nopened fire. You're seeking your own\ndeath. Fire. But the bullets did not\nhurt them. The three laughed loudly.\nHaha. Fired? Why doesn't it hurt at all?\nThe subordinate said in horror, \"This\ntype of bullet usually works on\ncultivators. Why doesn't it work now? We\nhave never dealt with golden core\ncultivators before.\" The purple-haired\nman immediately showed off his power. If\nyou don't want to die, get lost. A\nsickopant below said, \"Brother Hong\nactually cultivates lightning\ntechniques. The power of lightning\ntechniques is unparalleled.\" Hearing\nthis, he laughed and said, \"Huh, this is\njust a small matter. It's time for us to\ntake charge of Hasha.\" The ponytail man\nsaid, \"Look quickly. There are dark\nclouds ahead.\" Everyone turned their\nheads to check. The sycophin asked, \"Can\nBrother Hong summon such a powerful\nlightning array?\" The purple-haired man\nheard this and cursed. \"Idiot. That\nwasn't summoned by me. A person appeared\nin the clouds, his eyes bloodshot,\nsaying unhappily, \"I was originally\nabout to break through, but was\ndisturbed by you people.\" \"Fine, then\nuse your golden cores to compensate me.\"\nThe subordinates said in fear, \"What\nkind of great monster is this?\" His\ncompanion said, \"Worshipfully, that is\nthe peerless hero protecting our grand\nchief. It's&lt;unk&gt;s reinforcements.\"\nHe commanded the dark clouds, and the\ncloud obeyed, grabbing the three people.\nThe three screamed in panic. Ah, I can't\nmove. Help! Thunder and lightning\nrumbled in the clouds. The purple-haired\nman still spoke stiffly. Who are you?\nDon't try to scare me. I, Hong Loy, am a\nlightning cultivation expert. In his\nheart, he pondered. This person's\nbackground is not small, likely much\nstronger than me. If I can't beat him,\ncan I escape? I'd better run than he\nthought. Or maybe run into the\nresidential area. He surely can't use\nelectricity to shock ordinary civilians\nto death, right? But Duong Dien chased\nafter him, crossing his arms and asking,\n\"Why run so fast? Didn't you ask who I\nam? Then let me tell you, my name is\nDuong Denten.\" The purple-haired man\nstammered. \"You, you are the Hadu war\ngod, Duong Dien.\" He sneered. \"That was\nbefore. In the future, there will be no\nmore Ha du war god, Duong Denten. Only\nthe great demon Duong Denten.\" Then he\ncontrolled the lightning to attack the\npurple-haired man. The purple-haired man\nshouted, \"No.\" Duong Dien held the\npurple-haired man's golden core, saying,\n\"Happily, eating a golden core can\nincrease my cultivation. Not bad at all.\nI need more golden cores. Just one is\nnot enough. I need the golden cores of\neveryone in Hadu. Then he flew towards\nthe subordinates. They said in unison,\n\"Duong dinen, don't act recklessly.\"\n\"Duong dinien, I am Tramac's person.\nDon't harm us.\" He asked again, \"Tramac,\nwho is Tramac?\" Then he spoke\ndecisively, simultaneously launching an\nattack towards those people. \"I don't\ncare who you are. I will kill without\nmercy.\" At this critical moment, Tranac\nmade it back in time, blocking the\nattack and shouting, \"Duong dinen, are\nyou crazy?\" He slowly grew larger, then\nsaid indifferently, \"Who are you daring\nto stop me?\" Tranmac immediately took\naction, too lazy to talk nonsense, and\nexplained, \"What a demon bind.\" Several\nropes bound Duong deni tightly. He\nstruggled. \"Uggh.\"\nTranmack immediately said, \"Don't\nstruggle anymore. As long as you have\nentered the demonic path, you cannot\nescape. Duong Den Tin sweated profusely,\ncommanding, \"Let me go.\" He slowly\nreturned to his normal size. Tranmack\nlooked at him and said, \"I didn't expect\nyou to fall so deep into the demonic\npath. Even your memory and intellect are\nseriously affected. Today, I will pass\non a demonic technique to you. From now\non, you will follow by my side, never to\nleave me.\" This technique is called 33\nHeaven's Demon. I hope you can cultivate\nit well in the future. Seeming to be\nawakened, Duong Denten said, \"Ah, you\nare Tranmac.\" Tranmac commanded,\n\"Protect the conscience in your heart.\nUse the demonic technique to do\nrighteous deeds.\" Duong Denten quickly\nreplied, \"Yes, master.\" Tranmac thought\nimpatiently. Truly troublesome. This\nplace is temporarily peaceful. Just\ndon't know how Macmon is right now. At\nthis moment at Macmon, another group of\npeople arrived. Tran tongue too stood at\nthe door and asked, \"What are you people\ndoing at Macmon?\" Granny Long opened her\nmouth and said, \"Where is Tranmack? What\non earth has happened to this world? I\nneed to clarify.\" So, Daisong also said,\n\"Tran tongue too, call Tramac out here.\"\nWe, the four great ancient sects, are\nnot here today to find trouble with\nTranmack. We just want to ask some\nthings. Tran tongue 2 raised his hand to\nstop them. Then said, \"My master is not\nat Macon. Please leave. Wait for my\nmaster to return. I will report this\nmatter to him. Hu Fu shouted\nimpatiently. Not here. Such a terrible\nthing has happened. Others might not\nknow, but we know very well. Didn't he\ntouch the dragon vein? Truck Van Hugh\nalso chimed in. Do you know how much\ndamage your master has caused to this\nworld? The whole world will be destroyed\nbecause of this. Granny Long also joined\nin. That's right. He must hand over the\nmagic treasure that broke the dragon\nvein to us. Maybe then we can save this\nworld. Tran Tong too thought to himself.\nNo wonder they came to the door to\nthreaten. It turns out they think master\nhas a magic treasure in hand and want to\nsnatch it. He stroked the whisk in his\nhand and said in a deep voice, \"Cut the\nnonsense. Why don't I see if the four\ngreat sex are as formidable as you often\nboast?\" So Da Song was the first to\nattack. He said, \"The little towist\npriest doesn't know the immensity of\nheaven and earth. Watch me. So Daong\nsubdue you.\" Tran tongue swung the whisk\nin his hand vigorously. An energy storm\nimmediately struck his mouth still\nsaying, \"Is that so? Then I must learn\nfrom you.\" Tran tongue too said\nregretfully. However, you are too slow\nbecause so Daisong had been slapped\nstraight in the face by that force. A\ntooth also flew away with it. Tran\ntongue too continued to provoke. What's\nwrong? You're old, senior. You should\nretire and enjoy your old age. So die.\nSwang immediately flew into a thunderous\nrage. You wet behind the ears, Brad,\ndaring to break my so family's front\nteeth. I have to teach you a lesson\ntoday. Saying so, the old man threw a\npunch at Tran tongue too. But Tran\ntongue 2 also quickly counter with a\npunch, muttering, \"Take my mystic divine\nfist, mountain-breaking fist.\" Tran\ntongue 2 neutralized that punch and a\nsmall explosion rang out. So Daong\nlooked at his palm thinking, \"This\ntowist is really strong.\" So Daang swung\nhis staff, shouting loudly. river\nsplitting. At this moment, a shout came\nfrom so die swang side. Senior so please\nstep back. Truck Van Hugh rushed down\ncalmly saying let me deal with him. Then\nhe skillfully danced with his long sword\nshouting the autumn water and the vast\nsky are of one color. Take this sword of\nmine. Tranung too immediately sensed it.\nThinking the killing intent is too\nstrong. I'm afraid I can't block this\nsword. He dodged while thinking but I\ncannot retreat. Behind me is Macmon. I\nmust swear to defend Macon to the death.\nYou must remember well. When you throw a\npunch, it must be irretrievable. Only\nthen can it break high mountains. He\npoured all his strength into his hand,\nthen shouted, \"Master.\" Tran Tongu's\neyes were full of vigilance. He calmly\nthought while unifying his consciousness\nand action, bravely advancing,\ninvincible in battle, conquering every\nattack. the high mountain in front. One\npunch can destroy it. He recalled the\nscene when he was practicing. This is\nthe true meaning of the heavenly mystic\ndivine fist. Master passed on his\nproudest heavenly mystic divine fist to\nme. I cannot shame master. When truck\nvan Hugh rushed in, Tran tongue 2 put\nall his power into one punch. Heavenly\nmystic divine fist first form, severing\nmountain peaks, he actually blocked\nTruck Van Hugh's sword with his bare\nhands. Truck van Hugh didn't even know\nwhat happened. He said, \"You lost.\"\nSuddenly, he felt a sweet metallic taste\nin his mouth, then spat out a mouthful\nof blood. The sword in his hand also\nshattered. He exclaimed in astonishment,\n\"Huh? What?\" His body quickly knelled on\nthe ground, saying in disbelief, \"How is\nthis possible?\" Granny Long also found\nit hard to accept, asking suspiciously,\n\"Mr. Hidden Sword, Truck Van Hugh\nactually defeated? How is this\npossible?\" Hufu held his battle axe,\nthinking in horror. Just one punch broke\nTruck Van Hugh's sword. Just one punch\nseverely injured Truck Van Hugh's mind.\nHis fist technique was almost the same\nas before, but it seemed slightly\ndifferent. Where exactly is the\ndifference? Tran tongue too also\ncouldn't believe himself looking at his\npalm and thinking, \"Is this the true\npower of the heavenly mystic divine\nfist?\" Sure enough, it's too strong. Q\nFu brazenly said, \"Old Tauist, you are a\nbit unusual. Tell me the chant for your\nfist technique, and I will spare your\nlife.\" Tran tongue too said firmly, \"You\ndare to dream of snatching the\ncultivation method my master passed down\nto me.\" Shameless scoundrel, Chu Fu\nshouted, purple with rage, refusing a\ntoast only to drink a forfeit. D saying\nso, he swung his ax to chop at Tran\ntongue, too. Granny Long asked in panic,\n\"You really want to kill him?\" Tranmac\nwon't let us off. Tufu said, \"You guys\nleave here first.\" The other three\nimmediately fled. Seeing this, Tran Tong\n2 thought, \"Is something coming?\" Tufu\nbrought his ax down, shouting, splitting\nMount Hua with force. That stream of\npower quickly rushed towards him. Tran\nTong too thought firmly. \"No matter\nwhat, I must go all out to respond.\"\nThen he also put out both hands to\nblock, shouting, \"Suppressing rivers.\"\nhe thought in panic. No, my cultivation\nis not enough. I can't block it nor beat\nhim. He recalled Tranmax words. To\nbecome a powerhouse, first you must have\na strong heart. Whatever blocks your\nway, you must smash it. He immediately\ngained motivation. Power surged in his\nhands, saying, \"Master's teachings. I\ncarve into my bones and heart. I\ndefinitely must defeat him.\" Kufu asked\narrogantly, \"Let's see if he can\nwithstand my next move.\" Saying so he\nused splitting mount hua with force\nagain. Tran tongue 2 also used the\nheavenly mystic divine fist to respond.\nThen an explosion rang out. Both were\nblasted away. Tranung too struggled to\nstand up muttering cough. Master I'm\nsorry your disciple tried his best. At\nthis moment Tramac appeared supporting\nhim and comforting. It's okay. You did\nvery well. Go to sleep. Leave the rest\nof me. Tufu saw Tran and asked who are\nyou? Tranmack said angrily. I am Macon's\nTranmack, the very master of the old\ntowist you guys just bullied. Dufu Lette\nLai John M. You are Tranmack. So die\nsong plucked up the courage to say hand\nover the treasure and we will spare your\nlife. Granny Long also threatened\nTranmack. Hand over the treasure that\nactivated the dragon vein. Otherwise,\nthis tiny Mac of yours will turn into\nashes today. Tranmack said with an\ninnocent face, treasure activating the\ndragon vein. What is that? Tufu shouted,\n\"Stop pretending. If there's no\ntreasure, how could you withstand a\ndragon veins attack?\" Granny Long also\ninterjected contemptuously. \"Such a\nheaven-fying treasure is not something a\nlittle toist like you can possess.\"\nChufu said impatiently, \"Stubborn guy,\nif you still don't hand over the\ntreasure, I will kill you.\" Tranmac\nwalked up to him calmly, saying, \"Then\ncome do it yourself.\" Then he asked\nback, \"Kill me.\" Tufu snorted in anger,\nthen stepped back. Two foos said to his\naccompllices, \"This brat is not simple.\nI actually feel fear. Let's attack\ntogether.\" Granny Long also flew over.\nSo Daisong also rushed up from below,\nsaying, \"Granny, let my whip bind him\nfirst.\" Everyone revealed a greedy look,\nstaring at Tranmack. So Daang used the\nwhip to wrap around Tranmack, then said\nto the others, \"Bound him. Hurry up.\"\nFirst was Chu Fu's ax chopping down. He\neven said, \"The brat wants to die.\ndestroy Macon for me. Then he chopped\nstraight down to the ground, although\nthe power was great. After the dust and\nsmoke cleared, Granny Long asked\nsuspiciously, \"Did we succeed?\" So,\nDaisong shook his head, hesitatingly,\nsaying, \"No, that's not right. There's\nmovement. He's not dead yet.\" Q Fu asked\nin disbelief, \"Not dead yet?\"\nImmediately, he used splitting Mount Hua\nwith force to chop an ax towards that\ndirection again. Tranmac also quickly\ndisplayed his fist technique. Heavenly\nmystic divine fist severing mountain\npeaks. Both sides fought fiercely. One\npunch from Tranmack beat back Tufu. Duh.\nGranny Long was scared into a cold\nsweat, saying, \"This stream of power of\nyours.\" Before she finished speaking,\nTranmack interrupted and said to them,\n\"Plotting to kill and steal treasure for\ngreat ancient sex deserve punishment.\"\nGranny Long then rushed towards\nTranmack, shouting, \"Go to die. I want\nto perish together with you. Tranmack\ngently urged his power, blocking her,\nsaying, \"It seems the ones being\ndestroyed are you guys.\" Finally, only\nTruck Van Hugh remained standing there.\nTran Mack looked at him and asked, \"Now\nof the sect leaders of the four great\nancient sects, only you are left.\" Truck\nVan Hugh questioned, \"What exactly do\nyou mean? Why not kill me?\" Tranmac\nordered, \"Pass a message to the four\ngreat ancient sex. The spiritual energy\nof this world has recovered. Don't dream\nof dominating the cultivation world\nanymore. Tran Mack looked into the\ndistance, his eyes full of hope\ncontinuing. This is an era where a\nhundred flowers bloom. A brilliant and\nglorious era of the Toa star. Just\nfocusing on the Toa star makes one's\nvision too narrow. I have to go home and\narrange things a bit. Then I will go\ninto the universe. After that, Tranmack\nturned around wanting to enter Macon.\nTruck Van Hugh asked again, \"Wait,\naren't you afraid the four great ancient\nsects will seek revenge on you?\"\nTranmack turned his head and answered\nconfidently, \"I, Tranmack, fear no one.\nWhoever dares to come cause trouble, I\nwill definitely visit the four great\nancient sex in person, making it so\ngrass cannot grow there.\" Then he\nstepped into Macan, saying, \"Everyone,\nI'm back.\" Lafang rushed out to hug him,\nsaying, \"Mac, mom missed you so much.\"\nTramac also hurly hugged her back,\nreplying, \"Yes, I'm back.\" His father\nalso said, \"It's good that you're back.\"\nAmong the disciples, someone also said,\n\"Seek master, you're finally back. We\nall missed you very much.\" Tramac looked\nat them thinking, \"There are still many,\nmany people I can never meet again. The\nones I liked, the ones I hated, all have\nvanished in a smoke in this chaos. The\npath of cultivation is long. 10,000\nyears later, how many people will be\nleft to discuss the past with me? Only\nlittle junior sister Tran Mack knelt\ndown paying respects to his deceased\ngrandfather making a decision in his\nheart. Wait for me to reach the\ncultivation world to find little junior\nsister again. The Toa Star had changed\ngreatly. Things change and stars move.\nTranmack clasped his hands whispering,\n\"Grandfather, I'm about to leave here.\nBut rest assured before I go, I will\nchange this world.\" So Mmon has no\nworries for the future. Tranmack then\nwent to Tran Tong 2's room and spoke\nabout this. Tran tongue 2 jumped up then\nasked, \"Master wants to leave.\" Tramac\nreplied, \"Yeah, this trip to the\ncultivation world, I cannot help but\ngo.\" He added, \"After I leave, Macon\nwill rely entirely on you.\" Hearing\nthis, Tran tongue too jumped, shaking\nhis head. How can I do that? This\ndisciple is dull. Currently, the\nspiritual energy of Toa star is so\ndense, yet I still haven't broken\nthrough to golden core.\nComforting. You have already triggered\nyour potential. It's time to change you\nto another cultivation method. Tran\ntongue too asked back. Change\ncultivation method. I find the current\nmethod very good. It's just that the\ndisciple is dull. Tranmack explained the\ncultivation method I am about to pass on\nto you is the Dao is supreme learning\nheavenly whale art. Hope you cultivate\ndiligently protecting Macon safely for\n10,000 generations. Hearing this,\nTranong 2 also responded, \"Yes, master's\nteachings the disciple will definitely\ncarve into bones and heart.\" Trramac\nwalked out of Makmon thinking, \"Tran\ntongue 2 is very reliable. Surely he\nwill cultivate the new method I taught\nwell.\" Isam go to Hadu for a trip right\nnow. The great chief side is probably in\na mess. On another side, the great chief\nwas rubbing his head saying, \"Sigh\ntrouble follows trouble. Can't this\nworld be peaceful for a bit?\" At this\nmoment, a subordinate ran in to report.\nGreat chief. A team of cultivators has\nattacked and every one of them is an\nexpert. They are all heading this way. A\nsubordinate fire a gun while saying, why\nare there so many? All our cultivators.\nSomeone held a loudspeaker warning. You\nare currently invading Hasha territory.\nPlease leave quickly, otherwise we will\nopen fire immediately. The leader of\nthat group rushed forward, laughing\nloudly. Huh? They only have three golden\ncore experts. That person was Chaolo. He\nordered his subordinates, \"A bunch of\ntrembling wretches, kill all their\ngolden core cultivators for me.\" A\nsubordinate ran in to report, \"Great\nchief, Chowo of the Ancient Marshall\nClan is leading a team of cultivators\ncurrently slaughtering everyone at the\nfront line. We can't defeat them.\" The\nGreat Chief hurriedly said, \"Call Macmon\nimmediately.\" At this moment, Tranmack\nappeared, saying, \"No need to call. I'm\nalready here.\" The great chief saw this\nand said, \"Tranmack, you're here. You\narrived just in time. So, what do you\nplan to do?\" Tranmack then said, \"I\nalready know the basic situation. I will\ngo to the battlefield immediately.\" The\ngreat chief asked worriedly, \"Are you\ngoing alone? Wait, let me gather some\npeople for you.\" Tramac asked back, \"Are\nyou still worried about me?\" The great\nchief then said, \"That is a whole team\nof cultivators.\" That subordinate\nconfidently said, \"Master TR can\ndefinitely stop this incident, right? An\nenemy knocked down a group of soldiers,\nleaving them groaning on the ground. A\ngreen-haired man choked him, saying,\n\"Huasha has fallen. Those who surrender\nwill not be killed.\" The soldier firmly\nsaid, \"Hasha only has heroic spirits who\ndie in battle. No surrendering\nsoldiers.\" The green-haired man shouted\nangrily, \"Still not giving up? Then go\ndie.\" Just then, Tramac appeared,\npunching the green-haired man directly.\nHe immediately flew far away, spitting\nfresh blood. A saved soldier asked him,\n\"Are you Tramac?\" Tranmack didn't\nanswer, but pointed at the crowd and\nasked, \"Are these the invaders?\" The\ncrowd immediately swarmed up. One of\nthem said, \"Dear to sneak attack me,\nkill him.\" Tran Mack simultaneously\nunleashed a combo of moves at them,\nsevering mountain, suppressing river,\nshaking universe. Another soldier seeing\nthis scene thought, \"It's a god coming\nto save us.\" Chowo Lao, who had been\nobserving, suddenly realized, saying,\n\"That is Tranmack.\" Then he ordered the\ncrowd, \"Everyone surround and kill\nTranmack.\" Then they attacked together.\nA loud explosion rang out. Chowo laughed\narrogantly. \"Ha! Master Tran, the top\nexpert on the divine ranking, can't\nwithstand our siege either.\" As soon as\nthe words fell, a force surged out from\nthere, blasting them away. He dodged in\ntime, exclaiming, \"What?\" The dust\nsettled, Tran Mack appeared calmly,\nsaying, \"How strong can you be? Are you\nstronger than that ninecolored sky?\"\nChaolo immediately roared. All golden\ncore experts attack. One of them even\nspoke up to reassure. Everyone stay\ncalm. Don't be afraid. No matter how\nstrong he is, he is only at the golden\ncore stage. We have so many people. Are\nwe afraid of him? Tranmack rushed in\nfront of that person, saying coldly, \"Is\nthat so? Keep talking. Why don't you all\ncome at once?\" Tramac cut that person in\nhalf with his bare hands. The others\nmuttered in fear, \"Too scary. He is a\ndemon.\" Then they ran for their lives,\nscreaming while running, \"It's a demon.\nEveryone run.\" A subordinate clenched\nhis fist, saying sternly, \"Can't let\nthem escape. With Master Tran here,\nlet's block them. Kill all the animals\ninvading our country.\" Tranmac also\nbecame a solid backing for them, adding,\n\"With me here, you can be ruthless. Kill\nevery single invader.\" Then the crowd\nchased after the kill. Tranmack\nannounced loudly, \"I am Hashia's Tramac.\nChowo who had been standing there\nfinally spoke. Tranmack very good. I\nactually want to see if you are truly\ninvincible. Tranmack asked, \"You are\nChowo, right?\" Having said that, he\njumped up, threw a punch at him,\nshouting, \"Cut the crap, die.\" Chowo\nimmediately used his full strength. A\nstrange blue power wrapped around him.\nThen he shouted provocatively,\n\"Indestructible body, indestructible\nform. Congratulations, you can see my\nfull strength.\" Tranmack observed\nthinking to be able to cultivate the\nphysical body to this extreme indeed has\nsome skill. He is even stronger than Ma\nSand Dao and stronger than that Chufu.\nTramac also threw a punch but Shaolo's\nattack was a stream of blue energy.\nIndestructible soul eternal and\neverlasting god destroying fist. Tramac\nalso used shaking universe to counter.\nThe attacks of the two sides collided.\nThe people below were also affected by\nthe aftershock falling down one after\nanother. Someone screamed. Ah, the shock\nwave is too strong. Be careful not to\nget blown away in the sky. Chowo let out\na miserable scream. Ah, and fell.\nTranmax said arrogantly, hard to\nbelieve. Is this your full strength? At\nthis time, he was lying paralyzed on the\nground. Transmac landed on the ground,\nadding, I thought I would have an\nearthshattering battle with you. Is it\nending just like this? Too weak. The\nfollowers whispered, \"Chow is dead. What\ndo we do? Do you even have to ask?\" Then\nthey shouted in unison and acted, \"Run!\"\nTramax said, \"A bunch of ants.\" Then\nused his power to control them. One hit\nfor each, saying coldly, \"Go down and\nmeet your boss.\" At this time, the\nsubordinates seeing that scene said, \"It\nseems it's over. But where did Master\nTrang go?\" Tranmax slumped on the\nground, whispering, \"Not good. Spiritual\nenergy is almost exhausted. Divine\nconsciousness is also overused.\" So\ntired, Tran Mack leaned against a rock\nthinking everywhere in the world is\nprobably chaotic like this. All due to\nthe recovery of spiritual energy, the\ncultivation of cultivators suddenly\nincrease sharply. No matter what, I have\na responsibility in this matter. I must\nthink of a way to establish a new order\nso that ordinary people can live a\npeaceful life. This is Fushi's wish and\nalso my mission. Just then, a shout rang\nout. Found him. Master Tran is here. One\nof them stepped forward and asked,\n\"Master TR, how are you?\" Tranmax said\nsoftly, \"Thank the concern. I'm fine.\"\nThat person immediately said, \"It's good\nthat you're fine.\" Hashia is saved. With\nyour leadership, Hashia will definitely\nbecome even more glorious. Hearing this,\nTramac thought, \"My goal is not to lead\nanyone, but so that everyone can smile\nbrightly like this.\" Suddenly, the three\nof them were attacked by another force,\ndisappearing in the blink of an eye.\nTranmack witnessed it all, falling into\nshock. It turned out to be Chao's doing.\nHe struggled to stand up, then sneered.\nHuh? Tramac, aren't you very powerful?\nThey were right in front of you, and you\ncouldn't protect them. How does this\ntaste? Tramac was furious, gritting his\nteeth. Chowo. Chowo said arrogantly. I\nam right here. If you are capable, come\nand hit me. Can you even crawl up?\nTranmack stood up trembling. He\nimmediately mocked. You can't stand\nsteady anymore, right? You also have\nthis day. Tranmac was sweating\nprofusely, thinking, \"Not good. All\nspiritual energy is exhausted. I can't\nmove anymore.\" Chiao Lao said\narrogantly. \"Master Tran will die my\nhands today.\" Haha. Some Hasha people\nshouted, \"You are not allowed to harm\nMaster Tran.\" Then they spontaneously\nstood in front to protect Tranmac,\nsaying, \"You have always protected us.\nToday, let us protect you once. Master\nTran, please lead Hasha to become\nstronger.\" Tramac was thunder struck\nasking them, \"What do you want to do?\"\nThose people immediately rushed towards\nXiaolo, chanting Hua's backbone never\nbends. Protect Master Tran. Tranm\nshouted anxiously, \"Come back, y'all.\nCome back to me.\" Chow Lao threw a palm\nstrike knocking him down and said, \"Get\nlost. A bunch of ants.\" Tranmac screamed\nin pain, \"No.\" Then he shook his head\nand told himself, \"No, I can't fall into\nthe devil's path. I can't turn into a\ndemon who takes pleasure in killing like\nYang Ding Tion. If I become a demon, the\ndisaster brought about would probably be\ngreater than now. Huh? This is Tranmack.\nSurprisingly discovered something in his\nbody. This is dragon vein power. I\ndidn't expect my golden core to be able\nto absorb a part of the dragon vein. Now\nit's starting to feed back to my body.\nAt this time, a dragon flew out from his\nbody. Then Tran Mack clenched his fist\nagain, gritting his teeth and thinking,\n\"This is the last strand of dragon soul.\nStill not enough. I can't even execute\nthe first form of the mystic divine\nfist, nor use the heavens slashing\nsword.\" Tramac looked at Xiaolo, making\nup his mind. \"However, I can't worry\nabout that much anymore.\" Tramax said to\nthe Hasha people, then rushed towards\nShaolo, \"You guys step back. Leave his\nplace to me.\" They breathed the sigh of\nrelief, happily saying to each other,\n\"Master Tran has recovered. We are\nsaved.\" Then Tramac threw a punch.\n\"Hia,\" but could not break Chaolo's\nshield. Tranmac was knocked back. He\nexclaimed in surprise, \"What?\" Chowo\nsaid gloomily. \"How is it now? Your body\nis out of oil and the lamp is out.\nRight. Why don't you use your divine\nabilities? Is your body empty?\" Haha. At\nthis time, Tranac had fallen to the\nground, but he quickly stood up again.\nOnce again, throwing a punch at Chaolo.\nBut Chowo calmly said, \"Enough. No need\nto try to act anymore without spiritual\nenergy. You were just a piece of trash.\nBe a good boy and wait for death.\" Then\nhe kicked Tranmack away. The Hasha\npeople fell into contemplation, asking\neach other doubtfully, \"What's wrong\nwith Master Tran? Master Tran won't\nlose, right?\" Trough cough twice. Cough\ncough. then firmly said, \"No matter\nwhat, I will not lose to you.\" Chowo\nasked arrogantly. \"So,\" Tramac, run out\nof words? Tramac thought, \"Now I can\nonly rely on my own strength to fight.\"\n\"Also good. Today, you're my best wet\nstone.\" He said disdainfully, \"The\ncurrent you is just a normal person. If\nI crush you now, it's like crushing an\nant.\" Tramac retorted, \"You've crushed\ntwice, but I'm still standing here.\"\nXiao lao was provoked immediately swung\nhis fist shouting I'll let you be\narrogant but he avoided it. He exclaimed\nin dou what? But this situation\ncontinued to happen. He chased angrily\nscreaming damn it don't hide you count\nas a martial artist like this. Then Trax\nstopped aimed at the target executed a\nkick hitting his face accompanied by a\ncold hoof. After recovering Xiao Lao\nsaid in surprise, \"What? It doesn't feel\npainful or itchy at all. Aren't you very\npowerful? Where is your severing\nmountain? Where is your splitting river?\nWhere is your heaven slashing sword?\nThen he punched him, even mocking. Turns\nout your level is only this much.\nTranmack was hit and spat out a mouthful\nof blood, but he acted like nothing\nhappened. Speaking excitedly, do you\nwant to taste my mountain severing peak\nthat much? Chowo is surprised. You still\nhave spiritual energy. Tran Mack doesn't\nanswer, but throws a punch at him. Chowo\nsays this, but it still doesn't hurt or\nitch at all. Haha, you tricked me. There\nis absolutely no spiritual energy in\nyour fist. Tranmack ignores him and\nsays, \"But you were afraid. I just\nwanted to see your fearful look.\" Chowo\nis poked in a sore spot, speechless.\nThen Tran Mack continues to use moves\nrushing towards him. River parting\nstream. Chowo thinks to himself, \"No, if\nthis consumption continues, my spiritual\nenergy will also run dry. Relying only\non physical strength. I can't beat\nTramac. I must use all my spiritual\nenergy. A fatal strike. Then he also\nrushes towards the opponent, unleashing\nthe move. God destroying fist. Tranmack\nis immediately beaten until his body is\nbattered and unbearable. Seeing him\nstill able to stand up, Chowo asks\nsuspiciously, \"What is wrong with you?\nEven that didn't kill you?\" Tranmac\ntries to endure the severe pain,\nthinking, \"This is the terrifying part\nof the primordial indestructible body.\nEven if I die, my body can remain\nimmortal. But this pain is real. The\nattack just now drained his spiritual\nenergy. Now he can no longer use\ndefense. Tramax seems to have known the\nanswer long ago, asking, \"Do you have\nany stamina left?\" Chowo just utters one\nsentence. \"You are a monster.\" Before he\nfinishes speaking, he uses a sword to\npierce through Chao's body. He only has\ntime to whisper, \"No.\" Tranmac breathes\na sigh of relief, saying, \"It's finally\nover.\" Then he also collapses to the\nground. Just then, a cheer erupts. One,\nMaster Tran won. We won. A few days\nlater, many changes have taken place.\nTran Mack killed 10 golden core experts\nand over a thousand cultivators at Mang\nMountain. Everyone hails him as the\nprotector of Hashia, currently in the\nprocess of recovery and reconstruction.\nImmediately, Hashia's reputation on the\ninternational stage skyrocketed. The\nancient Marshall clan, which had always\nbeen discordant and refused Hwashia's\ncontrol, finally surrendered. Disciples\nof the four great ancient sects also\nflocked to seek refuge with Tranmac,\njoining Macm. Under Tranmax's\nleadership, will Hashia truly achieve\noutstanding achievements in this new\nworld? At this moment, Lidang knocks on\nthe door, calling him little Mac.\nTransmac is cultivating in the room,\nthinking, \"I have killed too many\npeople. The murderous aura in my heart\nkeeps surging. I must control myself. I\ncannot turn into a devil. I can control\nDuong Denten, but who can control me?\nSeeing no answer, she calls again. Mer,\nare you okay? Lafang worriedly pushes\nthe door open and enters, calling Mer.\nTranmack turns his head and roars at his\nmother. No one is allowed to disturb me,\nbut after seeing her, he immediately\nthinks regretfully, I actually roared at\nmom. This won't do. Then he stammers.\n\"Sorry, Mom. I'm Fina,\" she says\nworriedly. \"You haven't left the house\nfor a month. If this continues, you'll\nget sick.\" Tranmax scratches his head,\nthinking, \"I must suppress the murderous\naura in my heart.\" Lie defang touches\nTranmax's forehead, then says\nsuspiciously, \"No fever. Is your brain\nbroken?\" Tranmac immediately replies, \"I\nam perfectly fine. How could my brain be\nbroken? What kind of mother says that\nabout her son?\" She sits down on the\nedge of the bed then gently says\nalthough you haven't said anything I can\nguess a few things. Macker you have\nalways been my pride whether in the past\nor now. Then she adds seriously remember\nyou're not fighting alone there is\neveryone else too. Tranmack is touched\nthen says firmly mom thank you. I am\nreally lucky to have parents like you\ntoo. Mom I will forever forever forever\nprotect everyone. Hearing this, Lafa\nFuang takes the opportunity to advise,\nthen hurry up and tidy up a bit. Go out\nfor a walk. Everyone is waiting for you.\nWhen Tramac finishes changing clothes\nand opens the door, a group of people is\nalready waiting outside. Seeing Tranac,\nthey say excitedly, \"Sect leader Tran is\nout.\" Great. Master has come out of\nseclusion. Tranmack thinks, \"I am a\nreincarnated person. I have always felt\nout of place in this world, but now I\nhave truly felt it. This place is my\nhome with loved ones I cannot let go of.\nThen Tran Mack turns to the old man and\nasks Tran tongue too. Is Quint Ton still\nin seclusion? The old man quickly\nanswers yes. Junior's sister hasn't\nbroken through yet. Does master want to\ngo see her? Tranmack immediately says\nno. I better not disturb her\ncultivation. But in the very next\nmoment, Tran Mack appears in her room\ndefending himself. However, peeking at\nher breakthrough a little bit shouldn't\nbe a problem, right? Seeing Quinton,\nTren Mack praises, this girl's\ncultivation talent is really not bad. In\nsuch a short time, she has turned from a\nyoung lady into a powerful cultivator.\nBut immediately after, Tranac sees her\nopen her eyes, her face flushed red.\nTramac thinks, \"What's going on? Is it\nbecause she cannot break the shackles of\nthe physical body during a breakthrough?\nDid she use a body tempering pill before\nbreaking through?\" Then he wonders who\nwould do such a thing. Seeing her fall,\nTramac asks worriedly, \"Quinton, are you\nokay?\" Next, Tramac appears, saying,\n\"Let me go check.\" Seeing him, she calls\nout, \"Master.\" A moment later, Tramac\nlooks at the thing in front of him in\nsurprise, thinking, \"This feeling is\naphrodesiac poison.\" At this time,\nQuinton's face is completely red like a\nripe tomato, panting, and saying to\nTrac, \"Master, disciple feels so\nuncomfortable. Why did you only come\nnow?\" John Maqang\nand rushes towards a room. People around\nsee this discussing in surprise. Why is\nse leader trans so angry? What happened\non the other side? Nepunim looks around\nasking in confusion. What exactly is\ngoing on?\nThe surrounding heaven and earth origin\nenergy has been sucked away. She hears\nthis asking worriedly, \"Will Quinton be\nokay?\nthought dawn wah thei she is very strong\nin Quinton's room Tranmack breaks the\ndoor and rushes in asking worriedly\nQuinton how do you feel now seeing\nTramac she says happily master you\nfinally came back and she throws herself\nat Tranmack hugging him tightly begging\nplease help disciple disciple is so\nuncomfortable right now Tramac comforts\nit's okay don't be afraid then he rubs\nher head continuing I'll give you a hand\nfinish speaking Tranmack enters Quinn\nQuinton's soul sea. He looks around\nthinking. Seems the problem lies in the\nsoul sea. Let me see. So hot. Quinton\nhas actually been enduring such pain all\nthis time. I should have come to check\nsooner. Seeing the thing rushing towards\nhim, Tranmack thinks in surprise. This\nis a phoenix. Inside Quinton's body,\nthere's actually the power of a phoenix.\nIt opens its mouth to ask, \"Master, do\nyou love disciple?\" Tranmac is\nmomentarily choked for words, not\nknowing how to answer. Seeing him not\nanswer, the Phoenix flies away. Tranmac\ncalls out in panic. Quinton, where are\nyou going? Then Tran Mack releases his\ndragon, thinking, \"Looks like I have to\nsubdue the Phoenix power here.\" Outside,\nthe two are still hugging each other\ntightly. Tranmack thinks this is not\nonly helping her cultivate, but the\nblack mist remaining deep in my soul sea\nhas also been burned away by this\nphoenix fire. Not a trace left. The\nmurderous aura in my heart has\ncompletely disappeared. Quinton, your\nphoenix power is indeed powerful. A\nmoment later, the phoenix is subdued.\nQuinton opens her eyes looking at\nTranmack and says, \"The phoenix and\ndiscipled body is much more stable now.\"\nThen she hugs Tran Mack tightly again,\nsaying earnestly, \"Master, thank you.\"\nTranmac immediately says, \"All right,\nyour current cultivation can be\nconsidered complete.\" With two people in\nMacmon here, I also feel somewhat more\nassured. 3 days later outside Macon\nMacmon today has grown completely strong\nwith guests in front of the door coming\nand going endlessly inside Tran tongue 2\nis introducing to Tranmack master sect\nleader truck has come a visit truck van\nHugh scratches his head stammering\nbefore I tran mac pats a shoulder\ninterrupting no need to bring up the\npast your previous injury hasn't fully\nhealed yet right he immediately replies\nyeah my body is a bit weak still\nrecuperating. At this time, the two have\nsat down to talk. Tramax says, \"That's\ngreat. Then I have a pill here that can\nhelp you recover your body.\" Truck Van\nHughly replies, \"Then I will accept it.\"\nWhen he puts the pill into his mouth, he\nimmediately feels a change in his body.\nThen he says excitedly, \"Divine\nmedicine. I feel the injuries in my body\nhave completely recovered. There is even\nsome medicinal power left and used which\nI store to my body.\" Tramac also says,\n\"Happily, that is good.\" Then he\nexplains, \"This pill is called Earth\nHealing Pill. It is only third grade.\nThe legendary ninth grade pills can even\nbring the dead back to life.\" Truck Van\nHugh asks suspiciously, \"Is there really\nsuch powerful medicine in this world?\"\nTranmack doesn't answer, but asks back,\n\"Do you know how big the universe is?\"\nTranmack looks into the distance.\nExpression serious. How big the universe\nis, even the most powerful immortals in\nthe universe don't know. Truck Van Hugh\nsees this and says, \"In my opinion, your\ncurrent cultivation is no different from\nan immortal.\" Tran Matt corrects the\naddress for him. No matter what, I am\njust a cultivator. But there is another\nterm called immortal cultivator.\nTranmack clenches his fist, revealing\nmore. The emperor seat star also once\nachieved glorious achievements in the\nuniverse. But then the spiritual energy\ndried up. Emperor seat star declined and\nimmortal cultivators turned into\npractitioners. Tramac thinks of those\npeople, his face solemn in thought. In\nthe past, even divine realm cultivation\ndared to claim invincibility. Even a\nbunch of small cultivators running from\nthe cultivation world dared to fight for\npower and profit on Emperor Seedstar.\nHearing this news, Truck Van Hugh is\nextremely shocked. So, Emperor Seedar is\nactually a very weak place, right?\nTranmack points to the sky and explains.\nIn the world of immortal cultivation,\nmediocre people are as many as sand and\ngravel. Truck Van Hugh's face\nimmediately sinks. Then it's really\nridiculous. Until now, I just realized\nI, Truck Van Hugh, am not even equal to\na frog at the bottom of a well. Tramac\nplaced his hand on Truck Van Hugh's\nshoulder, advising, \"That's why I told\nyou to look out into the universe.\nFighting for power and profit on this\nemperor seed star is truly too\ninsignificant. His eyes became\ndetermined as never before. I\nunderstand. I will definitely continue\nto cultivate then go out into the\nuniverse. At this moment, Tramac finally\ngot to the main topic, not just you. I\nwant to ask you to do a big thing,\nhoping to receive your help. Truck van\nHugh asked curiously, \"What can I help\nyou with?\" Tranmax smiled confidently,\nstating his longheld wish. I want\neveryone in this world to start\ncultivating so that cultivation is no\nlonger the privilege of aristocratic\nfamilies. Hearing this, Van Hugh was so\nshocked he couldn't close his mouth. I\nneed you to help me build a team that\ncompletely obeys Hasha's mobilization,\nmobilizing the power of the four great\nancient sects. Tran tongue too will\ncomplete this with you. Tranmack told\nthe whole plan, \"Under the management of\nthis team, those willing to cultivate\ncan join. I will provide pills and\ndharma treasures so that ordinary people\ncan also use them. Van Hugh stood up\nvigorously exclaiming, \"Is this wanting\nto create an era where technology and\ncultivation coexist?\" Tranmack looked\ndetermined. \"I want cultivators in this\nworld to spring up like mushrooms after\nrain.\" Afraid Van Hugh might worry, he\nadded, \"Of course, this will be your\nworld. Later, I will leave Emperor Sear.\nEverything after that will have nothing\nto do with me.\" His eyes revealed\nregret. However, you are the master of\neveryone on Emperor's Seat Star. It was\nyou who opened up all of this. At this\nmoment, he insisted on knowing Tranmax's\nidentity. Your thoughts and abilities\nfar exceed people of this world. Can you\ntell me now who exactly are you? Tramac\nintroduced himself word by word. I am\nHasha Tranac. Just as Tranmac\nenlightened this place, there were\nalready many students. A few months\nlater, martial artsmies everywhere were\nbuilt one after another and began\nrecruiting. As long as one passes the\nexam into the martial arts academy, all\nexpenses are paid by Hashia. These\ndisciples also studied diligently.\nTramac also established the heavenly\ntreasure pavilion, providing martial\narts classics for students with\nexcellent grades. This place gathered\ncultivators of all ages, men and women,\nold and young, forming a system. Those\nwho did not cultivate could also return\nto peaceful days. Everyone grateful for\nTraact contribution even build a\nsculpture for him. Tranmax statue thus\nbecame known to many people. The teams\nwere also built properly. A supervision\nteam was established. Tran tongue 2 and\ntruck van hugh protected everything. The\ngreat chief persisted in saying to\nTranmack, \"All of this was built by you\nas long as you want. This world is all\nyours. Do you still want to go find that\nvague and misty future?\" Tranmac smiled\nand replied, \"Yes, I must go.\" By the\nway, how is the repair of the\nteleportation array in Meow Jang? The\ngreat chief honestly stated the problem.\nThe outer ring is almost done, but the\ntrue core part still needs you to\npersonally take action. Tranmack closed\nhis eyes, instructing carefully, \"Yeah,\nafter I leave, remember to destroy the\nteleportation array until someone\ncapable of reopening the teleportation\narray appears.\" The news that Tranmac\nwas about to leave made the great chief\nextremely regretful. Tranmac really owes\nyou too much, only knowing endless\ngratitude. Tranmack turned to leave. Ha.\nAll right. Now, I still have an\nimportant thing to do. Walking to the\ndoor, Tranmack affirmed firmly. Finally,\nI will return order to this world. On\ntop of that tower, an aura could be seen\nradiating. Tranax sat there meditating.\nHe clased his hands, shouted softly. The\naura immediately condensed into a block\nand flew out. A few seconds later, the\naura condensed in midair into a giant\nfigure of him. Everyone below was\nimmediately attracted. Hey, look\nquickly. There's a person in the sky, a\ngiant. It turned out Tranmac did this to\ndirectly declare to everyone, I am Hasha\nTranmac. Perhaps everyone has noticed\nthe spiritual energy of Emperor Seat\nstar has recovered. Tranmac exposed the\ndanger while reassuring the people,\nmaking everyone a bit worried. The\ncurrent world might be a bit chaotic,\nbut this is only temporary. Tranmax\nseriously stated the plan in front of\nthe disciples. As long as new rules are\nset, future life will be better than\nbefore. Today, I will transmit\ncultivation techniques to you all. The\nmagnified image of Tran Mack in the sky\nguided the techniques. Even children\nexcitedly followed along so that you can\nhave a sword to protect yourselves well\nin troubled times. Regardless of men,\nwomen, old, or young, all can learn from\nme. The government armies of other\ncountries seeing this scene were both\nangry and jealous. A person from tiny\nHashia yet dared to be the master of the\nwhole world. It seems we must flatten\nHashia. In the great chief's meeting\nroom after receiving the news of the\nchallenge, many people were boiling with\nindignation. Isn't Tranmack doing this\ndrawing hatred for Hashia? Now many want\nto maintain the status quo in the world.\nWant to declare war on Hashia? One of\nthem stood up strongly to give an\nopinion. Perhaps we should hand Tranmack\nover to avoid Hasha having to bear the\nwrath of the whole world for him.\nAnother person stood up to refute, \"You\nare truly ungrateful.\" Hasha relied on\nTranmac to survive until today. Yet you\nwant to burn the bridge after crossing.\nThat person frowned and argued. I'm\ndoing this out of concern for the people\nof Hashia. Having said that, he turned\nto the great chief. Great chief, what do\nyou think? You should also say a word.\nThe great chief was extremely calm. I\ntrust Tranmax decision. I believe Hasha\ncan go towards a brighter future. The\nwrath of the whole world. Let them come.\nI believe Hasha will definitely make you\nall surprised. At the quiet Macan,\nsuddenly came an announcement sound.\nSeck leader Tran, someone is looking for\nyou. This young man is one of Tran Mac's\nexcellent disciples. He greeted\npolitely. Chu lap Duke pays respects to\nmaster. Trram hurriedly went out to\nwelcome. No need for formality. Come\ninside and sit. Thank you, master. Just\nas they sat down, Tranmack praised.\nBefore when I knew you, your strength\nwas still very ordinary. Now it seems\nmuch stronger. Haha, you flatter me. Chu\nlap duk sadly recounted disciple\npreviously went into the mountains to\ncultivate then encountered the time when\nemperor seat stars spiritual energy\nrecovered. Strength increased greatly\nbut at that time disciple was trapped in\nthe mountains unable to help master\nTranmax smiled gently. It's a matter of\ndestiny cannot blame you. Chulap Duk\nsaid firmly however this time disciple\ncame to help you. Disciple also heard\nthe matter master declared to the world\nbefore. Disciple also knows in this\nworld there are many people dissatisfied\nwith master. Tranmack felt quite\nsurprised at his disregard for\neverything. Yet you still come to help\nme. Aren't you afraid of becoming a\ntarget of attack? He affirmed firmly not\nafraid. Disciple came this time\nprecisely wanting to join under your\ncommand to advance and retreat with\nmaster. Chu lap duk clenched his fist\nfull of determination. Please just order\ndisciple to do work. Tramax stood up\nexcitedly and said, \"Very good. I just\nhappen to lack an assistant. Welcome you\nto join our team.\" Chap Duk asked\ncuriously, \"Great. Is it a team of\ncultivators?\" Tramac replied calmly,\n\"No, it's a team of ordinary people.\nFollow me. You will understand when you\nsee.\" A moment later, Tramac took Chap\nDook to a combat arsenal. He still\ndidn't understand. Master, what exactly\ndo you want to see? Tramac pulled Chu\nLap Dook aside. see if this is powerful.\nWhen seeing that thing, he was\ncompletely dumbfounded. This below were\npeople wearing advanced armor. Tran Mack\nexplained simply, \"This is a dharma\ntreasure driven by pills possessing the\npower of a cultivator. Ordinary people\ncan also use it.\" Not long after, this\nset of armor was applied to the\nbattlefield. In the distance, someone\nwas running over. Haven't been here for\na long time. This guy wants to\nsingle-handedly defeat everyone. He\nlaughed loudly. I, the king of southern\nGreece, want to make Hashia once again\nsubmit under my feet. He glared\nprovocatively. Come and fight. Those\ncontrolling the armor rushed up without\nhesitation. He had a look of disdain.\nDon't think wearing armor means you can\ndeal with me. The gap between a\ncultivator and an ordinary person is\nheaven and earth. Finished speaking, he\nwas immediately rammed by the soldiers\ncontrolling the armor until his soul\nalmost scattered. What? Just a thing\nlike that hit me flying so far. He\ncrashed into a rock, smashing the rock\ninto fragments. Being beaten so\nmiserably, yet he was still so stubborn.\nHow can this be? This pile of scrap\nmetal can actually injure me. Num high\nlap in the base. Tranmac and Chu lapuk\nwere watching the battle live through a\ncomputer screen. Tranmack praised\nincessantly. Well done. Luckily, there's\nthe group of Mecca robots trained by\nyou. Tranmack looked at chew lap duk\nwith satisfaction. After returning, I\nwill record a big merit for you. Chu lap\nduk happily accepted at this time. Chu\nlap duk confessed. Honestly speaking\nfrom the beginning I didn't have\nconfidence in your idea. Didn't expect\neverything to be so smooth. On the other\nside Nam high lap was chased and had to\nflee everywhere. An era where ordinary\npeople can also become cultivators.\nHelp. He was running when suddenly an\naccomplice appeared in the sky. He\nshouted, \"Mlon, save me.\" The pilots\ncontrolling the Mecca were a bit\nconfused. What is that? She brought a\nlarge amount of military force. The two\npilots had to discuss retreating. Too\nmany cultivators. We must retreat\nimmediately. She glared. Sni zitulo\nnamap. While Nam High was explaining to\nMalon. The two people quickly left.\nDidn't expect you to be defeated by two\nmortals. I have a reason. He tried to\nexplain. You don't know. On their Mecca\nthere are many defensive arrays.\nOffensive arrays are also countless. Her\neyes became extremely dangerous. Are\nthose your only last words? Finished\nspeaking, she didn't hesitate to use\nmagic power, turning him into ashes.\nWhat are you doing? After Machon\nfinished dealing with him, she waved her\nhand coldly. A loser shouldn't talk so\nmuch. Leave the rest to us. In a forest\non the other side, many mages had\ngathered. A subordinate said smuggly,\n\"The Hasha elder is currently fighting\nin the south. We should just take\nadvantage of the fire to loot.\" That\nelder agreed without thinking much.\nOkay, everyone charge. Wealth and women\nbelong to the brave. Through cameras\nscattered everywhere. Tranmack monitored\nthem. In the forest, people arrived\nagain. Tranmack immediately ordered. I\norder all units attack. Many Mecca\nappeared blocking the mage's path. This\nis bad. The elder quickly thought of a\ncounter measure. It's fine. Everyone\nform a formation. The pilots\ncontinuously fired cannons at them.\nInvaders, taste this. The mages reacted\nvery quickly, joining forces to erect a\nshield. Blocking your shells. You can't\nhurt us. After the shield was fully\nformed, shells couldn't hurt them. The\nelder laughed smuggly, speaking with\ncontempt. Huh? Mortals are mortals after\nall. How can they break our abilities?\nThe pilots immediately launched\nmissiles. However, the old man wasn't\nworried at all. Midi, no problem.\nNothing can break this. The missiles\nfell, causing a violent explosion. The\nentire shield covered in smoke and fire.\nThe mage's shield was completely\ndestroyed. The elder panicked, \"What\nhappened? Who didn't form the defensive\nformation properly?\" A subordinate\nexplained, \"It's not a defensive error.\nThose shells contain spiritual power\npiercing through our formation.\" Hearing\nthis, he couldn't believe the truth.\nSpiritual power in the shells? How is\nthat possible? The people of Hasha\ndidn't let up, continuing to fire,\nbeating them into a scattered retreat.\nShells incoming again. Quick, into the\nforest, an elder ordered everyone into\nthe forest. Hasha soldiers were hiding\nbehind tall trees, just waiting for this\nmoment. They're coming. Seizing the\nopportunity, the soldiers immediately\nrushed out, guns in hand. We've been\nwaiting for you for a long time.\nEveryone, charge. The army attacked\nunexpectedly. The mages couldn't escape\nin time. Kill all the invaders. Spare no\none. The elder narrowed his eyes full of\nsuspicion. Hasha couldn't have developed\nso perfectly, so quickly, absolutely\nimpossible. He loudly speculated on\nHasha's plan. I know, you must have a\nfully armed squad, right? Wanting to use\nspeed to defeat us. Then he channeled\nenergy to prepare an attack while\nmocking contemptuously. You are nothing\nbut cannon fodder. Watch me destroy all\nof you right here. Just then, Tramax\nstepped out, affirming, you only guessed\nhalf right. He arrogantly led a few\nelite disciples. Facing that elder. Our\nnumbers are indeed few, but no one is\ncannon fodder. The old elder, not\nknowing the immensity of heaven and\nearth, launched an attack, aiming\nstraight at Tranmack. I think you are\ncannon fodder. The attack was about to\nhit Tranmack when it automatically\ndissipated. The old man seemed unable to\nbelieve his eyes. How can this be?\nTranmack decisively ordered, \"Those who\noffend my hashia must be killed.\" Chooap\nDuke sent him on his way. Chap Duke\naggressively swung his fist at that\nmage. Unknown when Machlon had appeared\nhere. Looks quite brave. He is Washia's\ntramac, right? Suddenly, an extremely\npowerful attack descended from the sky.\nShap Duke was terrified, but he still\nnimly dodged it. She mistook the person,\nspeaking in a contemptuous tone. You are\nTranmack. You look somewhat alike. It's\na bit hard for me to distinguish. She\nlanded in front of Chu Lab Duk, but it\ndoesn't matter. Who you are isn't\nimportant. Mlon placed her hand on Chu\nLapduk, looking straight into his eyes.\nAnyway, you all must die. Chu Lapduk was\ncontrolled by her, immediately\npanicking. Why can't I move anymore? She\nleaned in close, revealing sharp fangs,\npreparing to enjoy Chu Lapduk. Darling,\nTramac rushed over, striking her\ndirectly with a palm. Sorry to\ninterrupt. Trax seriously warned Chu\nLapduk. Be careful. Her weapon is charm.\nAt this moment, Mlon identified the\ntarget. So, you're the real Tram Macack.\nFine. Then all of you die together.\nTramac calmly took out his phone to\nanswer. Then wait for me to finish this\ncall before talking. Great chief. Is\neverything handled? Good. I understand.\nI will tell the people in front.\nHandled. Tranmack turned back to\nquestion her. You must have poured out\nall your forces, sending all your\ncapable assistants out. Right. With the\nmindset of a one-hit victory. There's no\none left at home, right? She was\nstunned, still not understanding what\nTramac meant. Machon frowned in\nconfusion. What exactly are you saying?\nA mage ran over, hurriedly reporting to\nthe elder. Elder, our capital city, has\nbeen completely occupied by Hashia.\nWhat? Machlan also quickly received the\nnews, causing her to lose her wits.\nMachlan, our base has been invaded.\nTranmack calmly said to them, \"Provoking\nyou. Letting you come to invade was\nmerely the beginning. This outcome is\nwhat I desired.\" 3 years later, the\natmosphere around Hasha was peaceful.\nThe whole world restored peace. Hasha\nstood tall at the peak of the world. The\ntramac of three years later had also\nbecome stronger. He was about to\nundertake his most important pill\nrefining. Walking to the side of the\npill furnace, he suddenly stopped,\nreminding Quinton. Wait a moment. You\nmust listen to my command. Absolutely no\nerrors allowed. Because the matter was\nextremely important, he specially\nemphasized. Understood? Quinton firmly\nobeyed. Yes, master. A few minutes\nlater, the sun rose. Seeing the\nsunlight, Tranmack happily said, \"The\nsun is up.\" Tranmack used magic power to\nconverge the sunlight into one point.\nConverging the sun, a large amount of\ngas accumulated in his hand, secretly\nwondering in his heart. Is this the\npurple chi in purple chi from the east?\nTranmack channeled energy to suppress\nit, then compressed it into an energy\nball. A moment later, it turned into a\npill. Finally turned into a purple pill.\nNot wasting time, he quickly threw it\ninto the pill furnace. It is the pill\ncatalyst. Then he ordered Ding Tion\nabove. Ding Tion used the thunderclouds.\nDing Tion utilized his power, calling\nwind and rain, guiding lightning down.\nSeizing this opportunity, Tran Mack took\nout many types of medicinal herbs, then\nput the precious herbs he had collected\ninside. As soon as the herbs fell into\nthe furnace, he decisively said, \"All\nright, withdraw the rain. Next is your\ntask.\" Quinton released the phoenix\nfire. Understood. Quinton poured in\npowerful phoenix flames wrapping around\nthe entire pill furnace. Following the\nsteps. At this moment, Tramax mood was\nextremely excited, waiting for the final\nstep. Like this, the thing I want is\nabout to be completed. Suddenly, fire\nrose to the sky from the pill furnace,\nmaking Ding Tion very confused. What\nhappened? A purple pill wrapped in\nterrifying energy appeared. Everyone\nlooked over. That is Tramac flew up\ncatching it then revealed this is a\ngrade five pill. Hearing this news,\nQuinton stared wideeyed in surprise.\nGrade five pill. If word gets out,\nTranmax seriously instructed the two.\nThis matter must be kept absolutely\nsecret. Otherwise, it will cause great\nchaos. The two promised in unison, \"Rest\nassured, Master Tranmax's face darkened\nbecause he felt an ominous omen. There's\na change. The clouds in the sky suddenly\ndispersed at this moment. Even Tran Mack\nfelt confused. A very strong pressure\ncame from the sky. An invisible force\nseemed to be suppressing Quinton and\nDing Tion, making them unable to resist.\nWhat happened? Why can't I move anymore?\nThe pressure is too great. At this\npoint, Tranmax still couldn't determine\nthe cause. Even they can't withstand\nthis pressure. In this world, only my\nmaster can do it. A few seconds later,\nTranmack unconsciously looked up at the\nsky again. Master, have you finally come\nto find your disciple? In his previous\nlife, perhaps at this time, Dong Hoa,\nimmortal emperor, had found him, taking\nhim to cultivate and even marrying the\njunior sister to him. Tran shouted with\nall his strength, \"Master, disciple Tran\nMack is here.\" Tranmax silently swore in\nhis heart, \"Wait until this disciple\nmeets you. I will definitely tell you\neverything I have done in this life. You\nwill definitely feel proud of me.\" \"Huh?\nWhy is the pressure getting smaller?\"\nTranmax stood under the vast sky,\nexcitedly, reaching out his hand. Master\nQuinton and Ding Tion had both stood up.\nWhat happened? The pressure just now\nseems to have disappeared, unable to\nsuppress his excitement anymore. Tranmax\nslumped to the ground. Master left to a\nstar. Did he not come to find me?\nQuinton momentarily didn't know how to\ncomfort him. Tranmack. Two lines of\ntears rolled down Tranmax's cheeks. His\nemotions spiraling out of control.\nDisciple is here. Did master not\ndiscover me? Do you not recognize your\ndisciple anymore? Why didn't you take\nme? Quinton sat down, placing her hand\non Tranmax's shoulder, speaking in a\ngentle tone. Master, what's wrong? What\nhappened just now? Was it your master\nwho came? Suddenly, Tranm hugged her,\ncrying like a child. Master. Master\ndoesn't need me anymore. Tran Mack\ngritted his teeth. Agitated emotions\nsurging in his heart. With Master's\nstrength, a sweep of his divine\nconsciousness covers the entire DTO\nstar. He didn't fail to discover me, but\nhe didn't choose us. Quinton had to\ncomfort Tramac. It's all right. Your\nmaster will definitely need you. A while\nlater, Tramac made a bold decision.\nThank you, Quinton. I'm much better now.\nI plan to proactively go find master.\nYou come with me, too? Many questions\nwere popping up in his head right now.\nPerhaps master has also changed. My\nrebirth has changed many things. So,\nwhat about Junior's sister Lackly? Does\nshe still love me? But a look of firm\ndetermination appeared in his eyes. No\nmatter what, I must meet her again. If\nhe doesn't choose us, I will proactively\ngo find her. The next day, they arrived\nat the Meow Frontier region. Tranmax's\nparents and many disciples were also\npresent. Are you just leaving like this?\nTofuang, saying goodbye to her son,\ncouldn't help but burst into tears. His\nfather tried to be strong and said\ngoodbye. Ma, be careful on the road. His\nfather's face couldn't hide the\nreluctance. I don't know how many years\nit will be until we meet again. I will\nalways remember everyone. Preparing to\nstep into the barrier, Tranmack turned\nhis head to bid farewell to the Toa\nstar. Suddenly, Encad hurriedly ran over\nfrom who knows where. Wait for me.\nQuinton looked at her in confusion. You\nare Kadette? She stepped into the\nbarrier just in time, thus being\nteleported along. In the blink of an\neye, they were teleported to Tien Kaiar,\na place where the land was barren\neverywhere. As soon as they arrived,\nTranmack put his hand on her shoulder\nand asked Diet, \"Why did you follow us?\"\nKadette was momentarily speechless, not\nknowing how to answer. \"I quinton opened\nher mouth somewhat angrily. We came to\nthe cultivation world. Do you know how\ndangerous this place is?\" \"Why didn't\nyou stay on to a star?\" Disliking being\nscolded. \"Kat shouted angrily. I didn't\nwant to stay on to star. I just borrowed\nthe teleportation formation for a bit. I\ndon't need you guys to manage me.\"\nSaying that, she fumed and turned to\nleave. Let's go our separate ways. No\none manages anyone. Tranmack intended to\nchase after her. But Quinton stopped him\nand Kadette just let her go. Kette\nbecame even more annoyed. Running away\nquickly. Why so hot-tempered? Is it that\nI can't even leave you guys? She didn't\nhave any specific plan in her heart yet.\nAnyway, must leave this desolate land\nfirst. After running for a while, she\nsaw a girl on the other side. There's\nsomeone I can go ask for directions.\nKahadette approached the girl speaking\nup. Excuse me. She smiled friendly.\nHello, I want to ask for directions.\nThat girl looked bewildered, still not\nanswering. Kath thought to herself, this\nwoman's appearance is very similar to\npeople on to a star. Don't know if the\nlanguage is intelligible. Ket asked,\n\"I'm lost. I want to ask you how to get\ndown the mountain.\" Kadet wondered in\nher heart why the other party had no\nreaction. Perhaps I have to give some\nmoney. Thinking of this, Kadat\nimmediately acted. The girl remained\nsilent. This is just a small token.\nKadette took out a bill with a large\ndenomination. Won't let you help for\nfree. Just seeing the bill. The girl\nimmediately remembered this type of\npaper was identical to the type that the\nbig shot left for the village chief last\ntime. Could it be said? Suddenly, the\ngirl collapsed to her knees at Ka Diet's\nfeet, making Kadette extremely confused.\nThis humble girl is rude, begging high\nimmortal to forgive. Huh? Kadette cried\nout in embarrassment. What are you\ndoing? Stand up quickly. At this moment,\nthe girl's face was pale, terrified as\nshe spoke of her suffering. My name is\nInguin Gwyn. I already have someone in\nmy heart. I don't want to bear children\nfor Ludwang, begging high mortal to let\nme go back. Kayette thought seriously\nabout this issue. Although the specific\nsituation was unclear, it sounded like a\nbully was bullying a little girl. I\ncannot ignore this matter. Then Cay\ntried to comfort Gwyn. What exactly\nhappened? Tell me. I can't ignore it.\nGwyn Gwyn sobbed while recounting. Not\nlong ago, two cultivators from Tin Lawn\nsect came to our village looking\neverywhere for girls to warm their beds.\nI didn't listen, so they wouldn't let me\ngo back. Cot's expression became\nextremely determined at this moment. So\nthere are many other girls who were also\ntaken. Go leave me to their place. Gwyn\nand Gwyn still didn't understand, asking\nwhy. Cut yet emphasized, of course, to\ngo save them. How can you only run away\nby yourself and ignore the other\nsisters? Gwynu Gwyn then revealed, but\nthey don't want to leave. Katiet was\ndetermined to go. How can there be a\nwoman who is captured and doesn't want\nto escape? You hurry and leave me there.\nQuinton and Tran Mack quietly followed\nbehind them. Quinton softly reproached.\nWhy still worry about her? Look at her\nappearance. She is the type who finds\ntrouble for herself, even if there isn't\nany. Tran Mack could only smile\nbitterly, but we can't ignore her\neither. Let's go follow and see. A\nmoment later, led Kadette to a cave that\nlooked quite scary from the outside.\nIt's right there. Kakette rushed up.\nGwenuin tried hard to pull her back.\nMaybe we shouldn't go. They're very\npowerful. Don't worry. I'm also very\npowerful. Kathy struggled to break free\nwith all her might. Wait for me to save\nthe people. We will run together. Katiet\ndidn't anticipate the consequences. Just\nrushing into the cave like that. You\njust wait outside. Just entering inside,\nKadette heard strange sounds immediately\npreparing to act. Uh uh hi immortal\nlord. Uh incoming. In the room, a man\nwas pressing down on a beautiful girl.\nKafid held a dagger slowly approaching.\nThis bully who bullies women must use\nhim to start the blade. She decisively\nstabbed a knife into the man's back. He\nimmediately stopped breathing,\ncollapsing, scaring the girl next to him\nso much her face turned pale. Hi\nimmortal lord. Kadette reached out to\ncomfort. It's okay now. You can go home.\nHowever, unexpectedly, that girl shouted\nloudly, \"Murder! Someone killed the high\nimmortal. Someone come quickly.\"\nKatarette was completely bewildered.\n\"What is going on! I saved you.\" The\nthree of Tramac were standing at the\ncave entrance. The screaming inside was\nall heard outside. \"Catch her!\" Another\nbeauty walking right into the trap.\n\"Catch that woman!\" Quinton sighed\nhelplessly. She even said she didn't\nneed others to manage. truly only knows\nhow to cause more trouble for others.\nTranmack gave a clear task. Ding tion,\nyou go handle a bit. Don't kill them\nall. Keep someone alive to question.\nDing. Tion seriously accepted the order.\nOver there, he angrily turned around to\nquestion what now? As soon as he turned\naround, Ding Tion's fist was right in\nfront of his face, seeking death. What?\nJust at this moment. Tramac also walked\nin. He put his hand on Ding Tion's\nshoulder, reminding All right, keep this\none. Ask some questions. That guy was\nnow suppressed by Tranmack's sharp gaze.\nTranmack threatened him. If you don't\nwant to die, then answer honestly. You\nare from Tinlon sect, right? He honestly\nconfessed. That's right. I am the elder\nin charge of managing outer sect\ndisciples of Tinlon sect. Found the\nright person. Tramax seriously\ninterrogated him. Then tell me about\nTinlon sect and that planet. The elder\nknelt before Tranmack, voice trembling\nas he recounted the situation. Tinlan\nsect is the one truly in control of Tien\nKai star. Recently, they opened a\nteleportation formation, saying they\nwanted to conquer a low-level planet. We\nare only in charge of guarding the\nformation here, waiting for news. But\nthose who went still haven't returned.\nThis place has also become an abandoned\nplace. Tramac heard this and was shaken\ninside, thinking, \"Luckily, I told them\nto destroy the teleportation formation\non a Toa star. developing for a few more\nyears will be enough to resist these\nbastards. Then Tramac looked at that guy\nasking, \"How are other planets in the\ncultivation world compared to this\nplace?\" The elder looked confused,\nhurtly answering, \"How would I know\nthis?\" Wanted to go to another planet.\nThe teleportation fee is at least 10\nlow-grade spirit stones. I can't gather\nenough in my whole life. Hearing these\nwords, Tran Mack rested his chin on his\nhand, deep in thought. So, the common\ncurrency here is spirit stones. But in a\nplace where spiritual energy has been\ndry for so long like the toa star, this\nthing is not seen much. Although I also\nbrought some jade stones. But here I'm\nafraid they are just equal to roadside\nrocks. The elder then hurriedly\ncontinued. Our tin lawn sex upper level\nelders have unfathomable cultivation\npossibly reaching nent soul peak even\nspirit transformation realm. Tranmack\nasked back with a stern voice. Are you\ntrying to scare me? Hearing so, the\nelder was frightened and immediately\nprostrated on the ground, panicking to\nexplain. Dare not, dare not. Didn't I\ntell you everything I know? Tramax stood\nup, looking at him with cold eyes. All\nright, thank you for telling me so much.\nThen let's end it here. The elder looked\nup, speaking respectfully, then\nrespectfully sending off high immortal.\nBefore leaving, Tranmack turned around\nand struck a palm into his chest, saying\ncoldly, \"Indeed should send you on your\nway.\" After that, Tramac turned to speak\nseriously to Yin Quinton. And in Kadiet,\nsearch this place a bit. Take anything\nuseful. Yes. And Kadette clenched her\nfists. Complex emotions rising in her\nheart. She thought, \"Tran Mack came here\nto save me. Can I still continue to\naccompany him now?\" Then she quietly\nwalked out of the cave alone. \"No, I\nmust be independent.\" Gwyn and Gwyn saw\nher coming out, hurriedly asked with\nconcern, \"Hi, immortal. Are you okay?\" I\nsaw more people going in. And Kadiette\nlooked at the girl, replying softly. I'm\nFina. Don't call me high immortal. My\nname isn't Kadi yet. Then she spoke\nquietly, eyes carrying some expectation.\nIt is. Can you let me stay for a while?\nCurrently, I have nowhere to go. And\nnodded in agreement without hesitation.\nNo problem. Invite high immortal to stay\nat my house. Before leaving and Kadette\nturned her head to look inside the cave\nonce, thinking, \"Sorry, Tranmack. I\ndon't want to cause more trouble for\nyou. Inside the cave, Tranmax's group\nwas still searching hard. This place was\nempty except for some fragmented spirit\nstones. The rest was trash. Suddenly, a\nvoice rang out. Tranmack immediately\nturned his head to look. Hi, Immortal\nLord. Three girls looked at Tranmack in\nfear, choking up as they beg. The High\nImmortals just now are all dead. So,\nwhat should we do? Begging you to spare\nus. Tramac looked at them using a\ncomforting voice to say, \"You were\ncaptured here, right? Don't be afraid.\nIt's safe now. Safe now? So, we don't\nneed to bear children for elderloot\nanymore. That's right. We came to bear\nchildren for the high immortal. Can we\njust go back like this? My parents will\nscold me to death. Yin Quinn Ton crossed\nher arms, looking at them with disdain.\nWhy are people here so ignorant? Don't\nwant us to save you, right? Tranmack\npointed to the pile of stuff nearby,\nusing a gentle voice to say, \"These\nthings are useless to me, but for you,\nperhaps they are very precious. Take\nthem back. Your family won't say\nanything anymore.\" Hearing these words,\na girl was happy and hurriedly ran over\nto pick up things, mouth constantly\nthanking, \"Great, thank you. Hi,\nimmortal.\" Tranmac glanced at the girl,\nsaying softly, \"Hurry, take them and go\nhome.\" After that, the three left the\ncave. Tranmax said to the other two, \"We\nshould also go.\" On the way, Yin Quinton\nglanced at him, asking curiously. They\nkept calling, \"Hi, immortal. Does it\nrefer to cultivators?\" Seems so. Could\nbe the familiar address here. Tranmack\nwalked out of the cave entrance\nobserving the surroundings and said,\n\"However, the spiritual energy here is\nmuch richer than Toto star.\" Yen Quinn\nTon closed her eyes, saying\nthoughtfully, \"But it seems the\ncommoners here are still very\nunivilized. There are still so many\ngirls who don't know self-respect like\nthat.\" Tramac put his hand on his head,\nvoice deep and somewhat sympathetic.\n\"You're right. We also can't change this\nworld.\" Yin Quinn. Tom looked at\nTranmack with eyes full of trust. She\nsaid softly, \"Tranmack, I believe you\ncan do it.\" Hearing this, Tranmack\nhesitated slightly, looking at her with\ndeep eyes. Then, Tranmack looked down at\na pit below and said to them, \"How about\nwe just follow this path and see?\" Yin\nQuinton analyzed the situation as she\nwalked. Based on current information for\npeople here who want to join a\ncultivation sect, there are only two\nways. She frowned slightly, raising a\nfinger. One is to be sent to a certain\nplace in town from a young age to test\nfor talent. Those with talent will be\nkept for cultivation. The second way is\nby paying money to enter a new sect.\nTranmack gently placed his hand on his\nchin, pondering the information he just\nheard. Although the Tinlon sect is the\nforce holding the cultivation foundation\nof the entire Tien Kaisar, in some\nremote areas, independent sect forces\nstill exist. Tranmack frowned and said,\n\"And the place we are standing now is\none of those remote areas.\" Afterward,\nthe three of them went to a nearby town.\nTranmack spoke up. For example, Lacong\nTown, where we are now, is currently\nunder the jurisdiction of the OAC sect.\nHearing this, Yin Quinn Ton immediately\nasked back, \"So, want to join the OAC\nsect?\" Tramac nodded without hesitation.\nI thought about joining the Tin Lawn\nsect directly, but that would easily\nattract others attention. Hearing this,\nshe immediately looked around nervously.\n\"So, where's the OAC sect?\" Tramax said\nas he pushed open a door and walked in.\n\"The Othac sect is right before her\neyes.\" At this moment, Tangier was lying\non the wooden counter, snoring. Tramac\ncalled out softly to wake him up.\nTangier, stop sleeping. Tangier looked\nup, drool, dripping, mumbling\nindistinctly, \"What is it?\" Tranmack\napproached him, getting straight to the\npoint. \"We need a little help.\" Hearing\nthis, Tangier immediately woke up\ncompletely, a look of joy on his face,\nthinking to himself, \"Business has\narrived.\" Then he grinned and greeted,\n\"Welcome, brother and sister. Do you\nwant to be guests or do you want to be\nhosts?\" Tramac frowned slightly, his\neyes showing confusion, asking, \"What do\nyou mean? How so?\" Tangier immediately\nbecame cheerful, clasping his hands in\nfront of him, enthusiastically,\nexplaining, \"I look at your appearance.\nYou look like people from some sect. Was\nyour sect wiped out and now you need us\nto help take revenge? Tramac found this\nquite interesting. The corners of his\nmouth twitching up slightly, smiling.\nYou guys even accept this kind of\nbusiness? Tangier immediately replied.\nThis is being a guest, which means\npaying money for us to help wipe out a\nsect. Transmac approached the counter,\nplacing his hand on the table, asking\nseriously, \"How much does it cost to\ndestroy a sect?\" Tangi didn't need to\nthink, answering immediately. That\ndepends on which sect it is. The price\nranges from 500 to 1,000 low-grade\nspirit stones. Tramac heard this,\nsneered at him. Huh? What if it's a\ngreat sect that controls a planet?\nTanga's face changed abruptly. He\ngritted his teeth, frowned, and asked,\n\"What? What are you saying? Are you guys\nhere to cause trouble?\" Tranmac\nimmediately raised both hands, signaling\nto ease the atmosphere. No, I was just\njoking. Don't take it to heart. Tangier\nclenched his fist, shouting angrily. You\ncan eat whatever you want, but you can't\nsay whatever you want. Do you understand\nthat misfortune comes from mouth?\nTrying to calm him down. Don't be angry.\nSo, what is a host? Tangier crosses arms\nover his chest, slowly explaining, \"Host\nof course means joining our OAC sect.\nHowever, looking at your appearance, we\nwon't accept you. It would bring trouble\nto the sect.\" Tranmack didn't say\nanything more. Just took out a jade\nstone, emitting a green light. He held\nit in front of the man and said, \"Don't\nsay that. I was just joking a bit. This\nis a small token of sincerity.\" Tangier\ntook the two pieces of jade, glanced at\nthem, his face showing displeasure, his\ntone somewhat disdainful. Are you\nplaying me? Bringing these two tattered\nstones to look down on me. Tramac heard\nthis, smiled, thinking to himself. Sure\nenough, jade stones containing spiritual\nenergy are indeed rare onto a star, but\nthese people in the cultivation world\ndon't even look at them. Tangier got\nmore and more angry, clenching his\nfists, stepping back and shouting, \"Get\nlost. Are you taking me for a joke?\"\nTranmack kept a calm face. He took out a\nlarge bag of silver and handed it to\nhim. \"Look at what this is.\" He glanced\nat the bag of silver, his eyes showing\ndisbelief. \"Damn it, this is actually\nreal.\" He looked at Tramac, unable to\nhide his excitement. Said, \"You must be\nfrom a great sect, right? So generous.\nThen I accept. The price is one spirit\nstone per person and I will take you to\nthe OAC sect. Tranmack frowned and said,\n\"Didn't I just give you spirit stones?\nBut this should be enough too, right?\nWhy are you asking for more?\" He\nimmediately hugged the bag of silver\ntightly, saying as a matter of course.\nThat was money to pay respects to me.\nThe entrance fee must be calculated\nseparately. Yin Quinton heard this and\ncouldn't bear it anymore. She shouted,\n\"What? Why is this guy so unreasonable?\"\nYong Ding Tion standing behind also\nglared and huffed. Showing\ndissatisfaction. Tranmack immediately\nturned his head, frowning to signal them\nnot to be impulsive. Everyone, don't be\nrude. Let me talk to him. Then Tramac\nwalked towards a man, reaching out his\nhand. Tang, give the spirit stones back\nto me. Tangi angrily slammed the fake\nspirit stones on the table, grumpily\nsaying, here you go. Get lost, you poor\nwretch. At this moment, there were four\nspirit stones on the table, completely\ndevoid of any light, looking fake at a\nglance. Tramac frowned and spoke up.\nTangier, what you're doing isn't right.\nThese spirit stones are clearly fake. He\nnot only didn't admit his mistake, but\ninstead shouted, \"What's not right?\nWhere is it not right? Do you guys still\nwant to cause trouble? If you don't\nleave now, don't dream of leaving.\" Tran\nMack narrowed his eyes at him, laughing\ncontemptuously, thinking to himself.\nJust a tiny transformation realm\ncultivator yet daring to bluff here.\nJust then, Tangier raised his hand high,\nshouting loudly, \"Go to hell!\" Tramac\ndidn't hesitate, pushing him flying with\na palm strike, then said coldly, \"just\nyou?\" Tangier clutched one eye, glaring\nangrily at Tramac, roaring, \"You dare to\nhit me?\" Saying that, he immediately\npulled out a signal firework,\nthreatening with a fierce face. I'll\ncall my brothers to beat you to death.\nTramac stepped forward, slapped him\nagain, and asked, \"Calling people, huh?\nThat's for cheating me out of my money.\"\nYin Quinton stood by helplessly watching\nthe scene. Just now, he said not to be\nrude. Yet, he's beating him up so\nhappily himself. Tangi was beaten until\nhe couldn't stand steady, trembling and\nbegging for mercy. I'll give it back to\nyou. It's right in the drawer. Please\nstop hitting me. Tranmack immediately\nturned around and pulled open the\ndrawer, looking for things like this is\nthe way. Tangier struggled to sit up,\nhurriedly, saying, \"Don't take it all.\nThere are dozens of them in there that\nare mine.\" Tranmack turned to look at\nhim, sneering sarcastically. \"Then\nconsider it your tribute to me.\"\nAfterwards, the three left the shop,\ndiscussing their next itinerary as they\nwalked. \"Where do we go next? Didn't we\njust pass by the Lac Fong restaurant?\nLet's have a big meal.\" At this moment\ninside the shop, Tangier clenched his\nfists, his eyes full of resentment,\nthinking to himself, \"You guys just wait\nfor me.\" A moment later, the three\narrived at a nearby restaurant. Tranmack\nlooked at his two companions and asked,\n\"By the way, what do you guys want to\neat?\" Yin Quinton reminded with a\nworried look, \"Don't forget our purpose.\nYou offended him. I'm afraid we won't be\nable to get into the OAC sect.\" Tramac\nlooked at her, replying calmly, \"It's\nfine. We can get in.\" Yen Quinton tilted\nher head in confusion and asked, \"What\ndo you mean? It's already a blessing if\nhe doesn't come to cause trouble for\nus.\" Tranmack rested his chin on his\nhand, chuckling as he replied. I\nactually hope he comes to cause trouble.\nThink about it. He will definitely bring\nthe most powerful person in the OAC sect\nto deal with us. Am I right? Hearing\nthis, Yin Quinton immediately\nunderstood. She frowned slightly and\nsaid, \"So that's it. You want to show\noff your strength for their big shots to\nsee.\" Just then, Tangi rushed over from\nafar, pointing at the three of them and\nshouting, \"It's them.\" He had a look of\ngrievance on his face, hurriedly\ncomplaining to the person next to him.\nBig brother, they're the ones who beat\nme. Tranmack narrowed his eyes at him\nusing a provocative tone. Tangi, come to\npay respects to me again. I stepped\nforward looking at them and asking, \"You\nguys bully my younger brother and even\nrobbed him of 100 fragmented spirit\nstones.\" Quinton immediately stood up,\nturned to look at him, and retorted\nindignantly, \"Don't you dare slander us.\nWe didn't take that much from him at\nall. Trandaihigh looked at her, his eyes\nbecoming shameless and greedy, then used\na lewd tone. Truly a beauty. If you\nfollow me, I'll only take 50 stones from\nyou. How about it? Tran Mack immediately\nstepped forward to block her. Speaking\nfirmly, men's affair should be settled\nby men. There's no reason to let a woman\nstand in front. Hearing this, Trai High\nimmediately agreed with a loud laugh,\nhis eyes full of interest. Well said.\nBeing men, we should fight out, right?\nTangier stood aside, reminding a gloomy\nface. Big brother, don't underestimate\nthe enemy. He's very powerful. Trandai,\nI hesitated slightly. Looking at\nTranmack with a probing gaze, asking,\n\"Is he that powerful?\" Tangi immediately\npointed to his swollen face and replied,\n\"My face was beaten by him.\" Tranmack\nglanced at Quinton standing behind,\nsaying to her, \"Everyone, don't make a\nmove. Let me handle it. After saying\nthat, Tramac looked straight at the\ngroup of people in front of him. His\ntone full of provocation. I'm in a\nhurry. You guys come to me all at once.\nTrandaihigh was a bit stunned upon\nhearing this. What? Then he clenched his\nfists, shouting with an excited face.\nYou asked for this yourself. Brothers,\nattack together. The group didn't say\nanother word, shouting aggressively with\nfierce momentum, rushing forward like a\ntornado. Brothers, let's go. Beat him to\ndeath. Tranmack put his hands in his\npockets, standing still looking at them.\nThen a dazzling aura radiated from his\nbody, knocking them flying in an\ninstant. Trann Eighhigh was not far\naway, his face pale, trembling in terror\nand shouting, \"Divine realm. Who exactly\nare you?\" Tran Mack looked at him,\nfrowning and introducing himself. \"My\nname is Tran Mack. I just want to join\nthe OAC sect and find a backer. That's\nall. What are you guys trying to do?\" At\nthis moment, Tangier pointed at Tran\nMack and blamed. If you were a divine\nrealm expert, why didn't you say so\nearlier? Trandaihigh looked at him,\nscolding him right to his face without\nmercy. At a time like this, you still\nblame others. Tangier lowered his head,\nhis face ashen, not knowing what to say.\nI also then Trai highly turned around\nsaying sincerely to Tranm, \"Brother,\nthis is entirely a misunderstanding.\nThis younger brother of mine deserves a\nbeating. I apologize to you on his\nbehalf.\" Tangier immediately knelt down\nbefore Tranmack, trembling and\ncowtowing, begging for forgiveness.\nLittle brother, be the bigger person.\nPlease spare me this time. Tranmack\nlooked at the scene before him, thinking\nto himself, full of doubt. Is it that\nsimple? Even more decisive than I\npredicted. Trandai High revealed a\ngentle smile, trying to curry favor with\nTranmack. Little brother, rest assured.\nWith me, Trandaihi, here I'll cover your\nentry into the sect. You won't have to\nspend a penny. Then he cuped his hands\ntowards Yin Quinton. Sister-in-law is\ntruly beautiful. I was rude just now.\nPlease forgive any offense. The girl was\na bit surprised, instinctively letting\nout an awe. Her face immediately flushed\nred, and she hurriedly turned her head\naway, thinking he called me\nsister-in-law. He thinks I'm Oh my, I\ncould die of embarrassment, but I'm so\nhappy. Trandai Hai then looked at Duong\nDentien who was burying his head in food\nnearby and said, \"This brother is this\nbrother has quite an appetite. I'm\ntreating today.\" Saying that, he\nscratched his head, smiling awkwardly to\nshow friendliness. I also booked a\ntable, considered an apology gift,\nTranmack. And he then sat down at the\ntable. He looked at Trandai High and\nasked, \"However, it seems you also have\nsomething to say, right?\" Trandaihigh\nlaughed loudly and replied, \"Huh, look\nat you. How would I dare bother you all?\nHearing these words, Tranmack picked up\nhis water glass and took a sip,\ncalculating carefully in his heart.\nLooking at his attitude, if I enter the\nOAC sect, I can probably bring him a lot\nof benefits. Truly a man who knows how\nto work. At this moment, Trandai High\nsuddenly pushed a small box in front of\nYin Quinton and said, \"Sister-in-law, I\nwas presumptuous earlier. Please accept\nthis small token of my sincerity.\" She\nlooked at the item in the box, asking\ncuriously, \"What is this?\" He scratched\nhis head and explained a hint of pride\nin his voice. This is the raging fire\nimmortal lotus. Boiling it in bath water\ncan help a woman retain her youth\nforever. Please accept this small token.\nHearing this, Quinton immediately\naccepted it. Really? Then I won't be\npolite. On the side, Tran Mack coughed\nlightly, hinting about himself. Ahem.\nTrai high immediately understood,\nhurriedly turning to Tran Mack and\nlaughing. Huh? Don't rush. I have a gift\nfor you too, brother. Then he handed a\nsmall box to Tranmack. My assets aren't\nmuch. This is all I can take out as an\napology gift to brother Tran. Tranmack\nopened the box unable to help but\nexclaim in surprise. Lowgrade spirit\nstones. Trandih High continued, \"I Traih\nHigh may not have high cultivation, but\nmy mind is considered flexible. 80% of\nthe properties in this town belong to\nme, so I can still afford these few\nspirit stones. I hope Brother Tran won't\nrefuse.\" Tranmack accepted the gift then\nslightly frowned and smiled. Then thank\nyou brother Tran. Brother Tran towards\nme. You surely have some requests right.\nTran die high then raised his wine glass\nfacing Tramac and said nothing much\nelse. You need the OAC sect as a backer\nand I hope you can become my backer.\nTramack heard this fell silent for a\nmoment thinking unexpectedly a burly\nlooking man is actually a sharp\nbusinessman. Cooperating with him would\nbe of great benefit to a popper like me.\nTranih High looked at Tranmack and\ncontinued, \"Brother Tran has\nextraordinary talent. Success is sooner\nor later.\" I only hope Brother Tran can\nlook after this brother a bit more in\nthe future. I would be extremely\ngrateful. Hearing this, Tran Mack\nclinkedked glasses with him, then said\nin a decisive tone, \"Agreed. Brother TR\nhas a talent for business. Perhaps if we\ncooperate, we can make Brother Tran's\nbusiness bloom throughout this\ncultivation world.\" Hearing this, Trani\nHigh, happily stood up and said, \"That's\ngreat.\" Borrowing Brother Tran's good\nwords. Let's have more wine. That night,\ndarkness gradually fell, but the\ndrinking party had not ended. Laughter\nechoed throughout the room. Everyone\nkeep drinking. We won't go home until\nwe're drunk. Under the crescent moon,\nhanging in the night sky, Tramac quietly\nwalked out of the room, looking up at\nthe starry sky, a deep feeling rising in\nhis heart. Starting today, this place is\nmy starting point. Little Junior sister,\nsooner or later, I will find you in this\nvast galaxy. Early the next morning,\ngentle sunlight pierced through the\nleaves, shining into the quiet room. In\nthe study, Tran Mack was intently\nreading a book, his expression serious,\nas if we're searching something. At this\nmoment, the door was gently pushed open\nand Yin Quinton walked in, her eyes\ncarrying a hint of urgency, calling out,\n\"Tranmac, he's here.\" Saying, \"He'll\ntake us to the OAC sect. What are you\nreading?\" Tranmack hurriedly closed the\nbook, replying in a calm tone. Nothing.\nHowever, I think you might be\ninterested. Then, Tranmack looked up at\nher, revealing an amused smile, and\nsaid, \"Huh, I found a new identity for\nus.\" Afterwards, the three left their\naccommodation and went to the main hall\nto meet the elder. Tangier saw them\narrive and gestured to introduce them\nsimply to the elder. It's these three.\nOld man do stroked his beard,\nscrutinizing them with probing eyes.\nSlowly speaking, \"You are people from\nthe Tanduok sect. This Tanduok sect was\nwiped out 5 years ago. For so many\nyears, haven't you joined another sect?\"\nTran Mack clutched his chest, figning a\npained expression, and recounted with a\nsorrowful tone. Back then, I was\ncultivating outside. When I returned, I\nfound out the sect was gone, and I was\nchased and killed everywhere, fleeing\nfor a long time before arriving here.\nTranmack turned to Quinton and\nintroduced, \"This is my wife, Yen\nQuinton.\" Then he pointed to the other\nperson, \"This is my senior brother,\nDuong Denten.\" Then, Tranmack continued\nhis story. My senior brother was hit on\nthe head and became a bit simple-minded.\nI want to join the OAC sect because I\nwant a stable place to treat his\ninjuries. Old men do maintained a\nskeptical attitude saying that sounds\nreasonable enough. However, the Tandoc\nsect was destroyed long ago. There's no\nway to prove whether you are truly from\nthere or not. How about this? To prove\nit, you must refine a pill. The most\nfamous pill of the Tandoc sect in the\ncultivation world, which is the ton\npill. Hearing this, Tramac was slightly\nsurprised, thinking to himself, I'm not\nafraid of refining pills. But what is\nthe formula for the Tanten pill? How\nwould I know? I recall reading in a book\nthat it's a type of pill. This pill can\nhelp cultivators enhance their strength\nand is green in color. Seeing Transmac's\nstrange expression, Old Man Vvu asked,\n\"What's wrong? Is there a problem?\"\nTranmack immediately replied, \"I'm\nfine.\" Saying that, he looked directly\nat the other man, his voice firm. I will\nrefine a ton pill right now. A moment\nlater, Tranmack was taken to the\nrefining room where a massive cauldron\nhad been prepared. Tranmack stood before\nthe cauldron, frowning in thought. Even\nthough I don't know the formula for the\ntonne pill, I can refine a temporary\nburst pill. It's also green and the\neffect is even better. Let's do that and\nsee if I can fool them. Then Tranmack\nthrew the medicinal ingredients into the\ncauldron, brought his hands together to\nbegin his technique, and used all his\npower to refine it from the outside.\nTaten Tin stood at a distance, observing\nthe smoke rising from the vent, a\nsatisfied smirk appearing on the corner\nof his mouth. Good fire, good technique,\na good seed. He broke into a bright\nsmile. I've finally found a successor.\nThis time, no one is allowed to compete\nwith me for him. Saying that, he rushed\nforward to find his new disciple. In the\npill room, Tranac was still focused on\nrefining. A moment later, the cauldron\nsuddenly emitted a thick cloud of smoke.\nImmediately followed by a violent\nexplosion. Tramac stepped back a few\npaces, looking at old man Vu with a cold\nlaugh. Haha, your crappy cauldron\ncouldn't take it. Hearing this, his brow\nfurrowed, his voice full of\ndissatisfaction. What? Refining a single\npill caused the cauldron to explode? and\nyou still want to enter my OAC sect?\nAfter speaking, he turned to leave.\nForget it, just leave. At this moment,\nTranmack took out a pill and called out\nto stop him. Wait. Although the cauldron\nexploded, I finished refining the pill.\nTranmack held the pill out in front of\nhim, saying, \"Give me some credit.\" Old\nman Vu turned back to look at the pill\nin his hand, his expression softening a\nbit. Phoenix. He took the pill and\nexamined it closely, a flash of surprise\nin his eyes. The color was vibrant. The\nmedicinal fragrance was overwhelming and\nholding it made the energy in his body\nfeel like it was about to boil. It\nreally is a ton pill. Just then, Tatien\nwalked up, his cold voice ringing out.\nIgnorant fool, that is fundamentally not\na ton pill. Tran Mack was startled,\nturning to look at him as worry rose in\nhis heart. He thought, \"Oh no, I thought\nI fooled them. How did I attract more\ntrouble?\" Old man Vu frowned, asking\nsuspiciously, \"If it's not a ton pill,\nthen what is it?\" Tatien Tin pointed at\nthe pill in his hand and said, \"The\nmedicinal power contained in this pill,\nhow can a ton pill even compare? This\npill is at least three times stronger.\"\nHearing that, old man vu flew into a\nrage, shouting at old man. You know,\nJack Squat, this is a ton pill. Have you\nrefined pills until your brain turned to\nmush? Tatianten also got angry, pointing\nhis finger in rebuttal. Old man Vu,\nyou're the one who's confused. This is\nan Aton Tien pill. This thing is much\nmore powerful. This young man is a\ngenius. The cauldron exploded only\nbecause its quality was too low to\nwithstand such strong medicinal power.\nThen Tatan Tin looked at Tranmack, took\na refining cauldron from his robe, and\nhanded it to him. Kid, as long as you\ntake me as your master, this heavengrade\npurple cauldron that has followed me for\nyears will be yours. Tranmack hesitated\nslightly, softly, saying, \"O Manvu\nimmediately interrupted. No way. I have\nto make this clear to you.\" He stepped\nforward, looking directly at Tatien Tin.\nTatien Tin, I don't care if you want to\ntake a disciple, but this pill is a ton\npill. Look closely. Tatien Tin refused\nto back down, arguing back. You ignorant\nold fool. Old Man Vu shouted again. Look\ncloser. Tatien looked closely at the\npill. And at that moment, Old Man Vu's\ndivine sense sent him a message. You\nreally are muddled. If this isn't a ton\npill, this kid won't be able to join the\nOAC sect. Immediately, Tatien Tin\nslapped his forehead and said, \"Look at\nmy brain. I'm truly useless in my old\nage.\" Tatien pretended to examine the\npill closely, continuing the act. This\nis clearly a Tanten pill. How could I\nhave misidentified it? Then he raised\nhis hand and said, \"Young man, my\napologies. I misidentified it. This is\nindeed a ton TN pill.\" Tranmax smiled at\nhim, thinking to himself, \"They just\nused divine sense to communicate. These\ntwo elders have already seen through my\ntrick. Let's see what they plan to do\nnext.\" Then the two of them stared at\nTranmack, thinking with serious\nexpressions. \"Sorry, young man, but let\nus find out more of your secrets.\" Tran\nMack immediately felt something was\nwrong. They seemed to be probing him.\nThe two old men started echoing each\nother again, their mouths ceaselessly\nexclaiming, \"How is this possible?\"\nMerely divine realm cultivation, yet\nable to refine a third grade pill. He\ntruly is a super genius\nfat brought the pill furnace in front of\nTranmack and said, \"Tranmac, join our\nsect. I don't even need you to bow as a\nmaster. This heaven rang purple cauldron\nis a gift for you.\" Tramac accepted it,\nthanking him softly. Tranmack thanks\nElder Ta. Old man Vu patted Yin\nQuinton's back at this moment,\ngenerously saying, \"Little girl, I don't\nhave good items for you, but I can\nintroduce Bakchi as a master for you.\nShe is the disciple with the highest\ncultivation here.\" Then his gaze fell on\nDuong Din Tien, saying, \"As for this\nsenior brother of yours, just let him\nplay around in the OAC sect.\" Tranmack\nimmediately interrupted, hurriedly\nrefusing that suggestion. It's better to\nlet senior brother follow me. His mind\nisn't very good, and he often causes\ntrouble. It's convenient for me to keep\nan eye on him. Old man Vu nodded in\nagreement. All right, then let him\nfollow you. Tranmack then thanked him\nand immediately left. Thank you, elder\nsenior brother. Let's walk around here a\nbit. He glanced at Duong Denten,\nsecretly vigilant in his heart. This\nguy, Duong Denten, is a ticking time\nbomb. I can't leave him be. If he goes\ncrazy, even I won't be able to stop him.\nThe scene shifts to the OAC sect leader\nroom. He pondered and asked the two what\ndivine realm cultivation yet is a third\ngrade alchemist. The two old men\nclenched their fists, replying in unison\nwith certainty, absolutely true. The day\nfor our oac sect to rise has come. The\nsect leader rested his chin on his hand,\nfrowning in thought, then asked back.\nBut is there a possibility he is a spy\nfrom another sect? T10 and old man vu\nlooked at each other upon hearing this a\nspy old man Vu remained silent then\nslowly said thinking about it that makes\nsense why would a genius character like\nhim run to this tiny OAC sect of ours\nTatien Tin continued what he refined was\nindeed not the Tanten pill meaning he\nisn't a disciple of the Tandac sect but\nwhy the need to hide another elder heard\nthis and joined the conjecture could it\nbe he wants to cause some trouble for\nour sect a Small sect like ours can't\nwithstand torment.\nClenching his fist and saying,\n\"Opportunity and danger always go hand\nin hand. A genius like him with just a\nlittle nurturing is a great chance for\nthe OAC sect to rise.\" Old Manvu turned\naround asking with eyes full of doubt.\nNurture? Who will nurture him? Look at\nour OAC sect. Who else can teach him?\nTatien Tin declared. Then let him\nresearch and explore on his own. Just\nlet him do whatever he wants. What does\nit matter if we make him an elder? The\nsect leader listened, rested his chin on\nhis hand, bowed his head, and thought,\nthen chuckled softly. The youngest elder\nof OAC sect. That's not impossible. The\nscene shifts back to Tramax's room.\nSuddenly, someone came looking for him,\nsaying to him, \"Greetings, Elder Tran. I\nam here to deliver your command token.\"\nTranmack took the token, asking with a\nsurprised look, \"Huh? Why have I become\nan elder?\" The person delivering the\ntoken smiled brightly, saying\nrespectfully, \"Elder Tran is a third\ngrade alchemist, naturally qualified to\nbecome an elder of our sect. I hope\nElder will look after me in the future.\"\nTranmac held the token, frowning and\nthinking, \"If I displayed my true\ncultivation with a hand over the oac\nleader seat to me as well.\" At this\nmoment, Tatien Tin walked in, laughing\nloudly, sayingly, \"Haha, Elder Tran,\ncongratulations. Congratulations.\"\nTranmack hurriedly turned to look, his\nvoice a bit shy. Elder Ta. Then Tranmack\nscratched his head, speaking modestly.\nThis junior has low strength. What\ntalent or virtue do I have to assume the\nposition of Oax sect elder? Tatien Tin\nimmediately waved his hand. What are you\nsaying? Young people being humble is\ngood, but being overly humble is\nannoying. Hearing this, Tran Mack\nclasped his hands and bowed to accept.\nIn that case, Tranmack will definitely\ndo his utmost, utilizing his lifelong\nlearning to bring glory to the OAC sect.\nHe nodded in satisfaction. That's how a\nman should be. A moment later, Tatien\ntook him to a place, then introduced,\n\"My OAC sect has a history of only over\na hundred years. There are no forbidden\ngrounds, so you can visit anywhere you\nlike. Just submit a few pills every\nmonth in exchange for living expenses.\nThe three great pillars of my OAC sect\nare the cultivation lineage belonging to\nthe sect leader, the magical artifact\nlineage belonging to old man Vu, and the\npill lineage belonging to me, Tatien\nTin. Then he looked inside, continuing,\n\"Of course, now there is you as well.\"\nAfterward, he led Tranmack into a room\nfull of books, introducing, \"You can\nchoose these cultivation methods and\nmagical artifacts of our sect as you\nplease.\" Tranmack turned, nodding in,\n\"Thanks. Thank you, Elder Ta. Then he\nquickly turned his head back, thinking,\n\"Honestly, none of them are decent, but\nI still have to pick a few items. After\nall, my true cultivation method cannot\nbe revealed.\" A moment later, Tati Tin\nasked from behind, \"Found anything\ngood?\" Tramac quickly turned back and\nreplied, \"It's a soso.\" And he picked up\ntwo books and a blunt sword, saying\nexcitedly, \"I'll take these.\" Tatien Tin\nstroked his beard, looking at Tranmack\nwith interest, asking back, \"Is that\nenough?\" Tranmack replied briskly. One\nshouldn't be too greedy hearing this\nsentence. Taktien looked at him\nappearing very satisfied to have such a\nmindset at this age. Very good. A moment\nlater, Tranmack returned to his room. He\nsat on the bed, focusing on reading the\nbooks. These fire control techniques of\nthe fire pushing hand aren't bad. They\nhelp strengthen my fire control force by\na few degrees. Tran Mack turned the\npages, muttering, \"This silent falling\nrain book is actually in the script of\nthe demon race. I never saw it in my\nprevious world. Immediately after,\nTranmack threw the books and soared onto\nthe ground without hesitation. Let me\ntry it out. In the blink of an eye,\nTranmack darted out, saying happily,\n\"Although this cultivation method has\nflaws, it can help me reach the speed of\na sparrow, which isn't bad.\" Tranmack\nturned his head, the corner of his mouth\nslightly raised. \"Next, I will think of\na way to upgrade this sword.\" Tranmack\nentered the room, holding that sword in\nhis hand, his gaze stopping at the\nblazing artifact refining furnace,\nthinking the most basic needs of a\ncultivator are pill refining and\nartifact refining. Haven't used the\nheaven slashing sword in a long time.\nTranmack looked at his glowing red sword\nfor a while. It just so happens I can\nuse this opportunity to refine some\nimpurities out of the heaven slashing\nsword. And using those impurities to\nstrengthen this sword couldn't be\nbetter. Without hesitation, Tranmack\nimmediately threw the sword into the\nfurnace. It would be best if I can\nupgrade it to a third grade spirit tool.\nTwo months quietly passed. At old man\nVu's classroom, he was lecturing his\ndisciples. When forging, temperature is\nextremely important. Just then, a series\nof clanging sounds rang out again. Each\nsound steady and rhythmic, causing the\nwhole class to stir. Everyone turning\ntheir heads to look in the direction of\nthe sound. Is someone refining artifacts\nover there? It's been nearly two months.\nThere's this commotion every day, but I\nhaven't seen him come out. Old man Vu\ncast a suspicious look in that\ndirection. A bit of curiosity rising in\nhis heart. This is likely a type of\nhammer technique, but not a hammer\ntechnique used for combat, but one\nspecialized for artifact refining. His\neyes lit up, the corners of his mouth\ninvoluntarily curving into a satisfied\nsmile. Within this hammer technique,\nthere seems to be some principle of the\ngreat Dao hidden like a wonderful piece\nof celestial music. Truly too\nmagnificent. The disciples saw their\nmaster dazed and hurly called out,\n\"Master is mesmerized by the sound of\nthis hammer again. Night fell in Tranmax\nroom.\" The knocking sound still lingered\nin the ears. He carefully tapped on the\nsword body. His eyes focused like a\nskilled craftsman. Almost done. Old Man\nVu sat in a nearby room, closing his\neyes to enjoy the echoing hammer sound.\nThis sound seems to be able to help me\nfind a breakthrough point. Finally\ncomplete. At this moment, Tranmack had\nfinished refining the sword. He looked\nat the suction force radiating from the\nsword body, involuntarily smiling,\nalmost upgraded it to a third grade\nspirit tool, but peak second grade is\nenough for the current stage. Then he\nlooked at the blade edge and laughed\nsoftly, naming it with great affection.\nLet's call you fire pattern saber. At\nthe same time, at old man Vu's room, he\nclenched his two fists, his face\nglowing, excitement written all over it.\nSuccess. Hearing this sound of the great\ndao. I'm about to break through. Then he\nhurriedly brought his sword to the\nartifact refining furnace. His heart\nburning with anxiety. Forge it. Must he\nread quickly? I have a premonition. I\nwill break through tonight. Looking at\nthe blazing fire, he thought with great\ndesire. Haha. I must refine something\ngood. Back to Tramac. At this moment, he\nwas testing his new speed. His figure\nskimmed quickly over the water surface\nlike lightning. Trram gently placed his\nhand on the saber hilt. Taking advantage\nof the dark and deserted knight,\nlaughing to himself, just in time to\ntest how this sword is. Having said\nthat, he drew the saber, slashing hard\nat the tree in front. The big tree\nimmediately snapped in two. He didn't\nstop, continuing to launch a move\ntowards the large rock nearby. Then\nlooking at the sword in his hand, he\nsaid, \"It's okay. Barely usable for now.\nAfter all, I can't fight empty-handed.\"\nThe rock he hit immediately caught fire.\nLooking at the scene of water and fire\nmingling before his eyes, he appeared\nquite satisfied. Finally, let's test if\nthis fire pattern saber combined with a\nfire pushing hand can burn this\nwaterfall dry. Just then, a loud shout\nsuddenly rang out from underwater,\naccompanied by a water snake rushing up.\nDon't even dream of it. Tranmack\ninstinctively stepped back, his face\nshowing a hint of surprise. What is\nthat? The large snake opened its mouth\nwide, rushing straight towards Tranmack.\nHe immediately took a step back,\nchanging his stance to prepare for a\ncounterattack. Just in time, fire push.\nTranmack exerted force to slash out a\nfiery blade energy forward. In an\ninstant, thick white mist covered\neverywhere. Tranmax stood in the mist,\nhis eyes staring straight ahead, asking,\n\"Who on earth is over there?\" From\nwithin the hazy mist, a figure slowly\nemerged, a low voice ringing out to be\nable to utilize the fire pushing hand.\nTo this extent, is indeed surprising.\nTranmax stood amidst the thick fog.\nSpeaking up again to ask, \"Who exactly\nare you?\" In the midst, a graceful\nfigure stepped out, saying, \"Who am I?\nDid no one at the Othac tell you that\nbelow this waterfall is a forbidden\nground, not a place you can casually\ncome to play? She frowned, her eyes full\nof anger, her tone reproachful. Not only\ndid you come here, but you also used\nfire to burn me. How truly annoying.\nTranmac was stunned for a moment, his\nface looking somewhat blank. This, he\nimmediately thought to himself. Didn't\nTatiant say there were no forbidden\ngrounds and told me to wander around as\nI pleased? The woman's gaze darkened,\nlooking at Tranmack with obvious killing\nintent. You are dead for sure. Having\nsaid that, an object rushed towards\nTranmack at extreme speed. A wolf\nunexpectedly appeared, blocking his\npath, causing Tranmack to startle and\ntake a step back. What? Tranmack looked\nat the spirit beast in front of him and\nsaid, \"This is a low-level spirit beast.\nGhost wolf.\" The wolf growled at him,\nits red eyes flashing with a fierce\nlight, rushing at Tranmack without\nhesitation. Tranmack immediately\nretreated, glared at it warningly, still\ndare to rush in seeking death. Then he\nswung his saber to counterattack\npowerfully. The sharp saberqi caused the\nground to crack open. The wolf, hit by\nthe move, cried out in pain, was knocked\nflying far away, slamming into a large\ntree trunk. Suddenly, a sparkling spirit\nstone fell from its body. Tramax stepped\nforward to pick it up and examine it. Is\nthis a spirit stone? Just then, that\nwoman appeared beside Tramac, sizing him\nup and said, \"Seems you're not some\nsmall fry. Quite capable, actually.\"\n\"Try again.\" Tranmac smirked faintly,\nlooking at her without any fear. \"Then\nlet's try. It just so happens I haven't\nstretched my muscles in 2 months.\" The\nwoman didn't say another word, whistled\nto summon spirit beasts. Soon, a large\npack of wolves rushed over, surrounding\nTran Mack tightly. Tranmack looked\naround, unable to help but exclaim,\n\"This many?\" Then he swung his saber up,\nchuckling softly, just in time. One\nslash rang out and flames erupted\nviolently in front of him, creating a\nwall of fire to block the wolf pack. D.\nBut the wolf pack did not retreat. They\nroared and rushed forward, using their\nmouths to tear apart the wall of fire.\nThe woman stood nearby, observing,\nmuttering. He's even using a second\ngrade peak tears spiritual artifact.\nSeems that old geyser old man who has\nbroken through. She frowned in\nannoyance, looking at Tramac, giving a\ndisciple such a powerful spiritual\nartifact. Why didn't he think of\nexchanging one for this lady? After\nspeaking, she placed two fingers on her\nforehead and spiritual power burst forth\nfrom her body. Let's see how strong he\nis. Tranmack glanced at her, calculating\nin his heart. She is actually a peak\ngolden core expert. She has been sealing\nher cultivation, and now she's starting\nto unseal it. Then Tranmack turned his\nhead to look at the wolfpack in front of\nhim, thinking it's best to hide some of\nmy strength to avoid causing trouble.\nI'll just pretend to be a bit weak. Very\nquickly, the wolfpack suppressed\nTranmack, pinning him to the ground.\nSeeing this, the woman opened her mouth\nindifferently. Seems this kid has\nreached his limit. She looked at him\nwith disdainful eyes, her tone cold as\nshe said. Just a disciple cultivating\nfire attribute techniques with some\npetty tricks fundamentally to not the\nperson I'm looking for. Then she waved\nher hand to order the wolves to scatter.\nScatter wolves, you can go. Do not\nmention today's matter to anyone. Before\nleaving, she turned her head to look at\nTranmack, her eyes full of warning as\nshe said, \"Otherwise, even if you hide\nat the ends of the earth, I will\ndefinitely kill you.\" Trowned, watching\nher figure leave, pondering. \"So, who\nexactly are you?\" As soon as he returned\nto his room, Tran\nVu standing at the door, his excited\nvoice ringing out. Tranmac. He smiled.\nhalf scolding, half joking. Where did\nyou run off to? Haven't seen a shadow of\nyou for 2 months. I thought you had run\naway. Tranmax scratched his head,\nsmiling sheepishly, and replied softly.\nHow could that be? I just found a quiet\nplace to cultivate. Immediately after,\nhe thought to himself, \"How could I run\naway? I still have to expand.\" He owe\nThak sex strength to swallow the tinlon\nsect. Old man Vu raised his eyebrows,\nhis face showing clear satisfaction and\ninterest, informing him of a matter. In\na few days, there will be a trial in the\nTienwin Forest hosted by the Tinlon\nsect. The rewards are extremely\ngenerous. One can even receive a spatial\nring. Tramac nodded without hesitation.\nNot bad. I will participate. 3 days\nlater, the trial area was crowded with\npeople. The sound of chatter ceaseless.\nIs it here? There really are a lot of\npeople. Tranax squeezed through the\ncrowd, moving forward, muttering softly.\nThis is too many people. At this moment,\nthe host stood on the high platform, his\nvoice majestic and clear as it\ntransmitted down, \"Everyone, please be\nquiet.\" As everyone knows, there are\ncountless spirit beasts in the Tienwin\nForest, inexhaustible spirit herbs, and\nalso forbidden areas. Recently,\ndisciples of my sect discovered another\nforbidden area containing all sorts of\nopportunities. Whoever has the skill to\ntake them keeps them. But inside, there\nis only one flag. Whoever can bring that\nflag back will be the winner. The winner\nwill receive a spatial ring awarded by\nmy tin lawn sect and their sect will\nalso be taxexempt for 3 years. I hope\nyou all give it your all. The disciples\nbelow looked up at the ring then\nwhispered questions. Is it dangerous\ninside? Can those with divine realm\ncultivation like us make it? The host\nsmiled and replied, \"Rest assured, there\nis no danger inside. It's just that the\nflag knows how to run, so you all need\nto try your best.\" Then he spread his\narms, closed his eyes, and said, \"The\nforbidden area can only be entered by\ncultivators under the golden core realm.\nOtherwise, we would have entered\nourselves.\" Tranmack listened and said\nthoughtfully. \"If there's no danger,\"\nthe Tinlon sect has thousands upon\nthousands of disciples. \"Can't they find\na single person with low cultivation?\"\nOld Man Vu leaned close to him and\nwhispered, \"Is there conspiracy?\"\nTranmac just smirked, replying\nnonchalantly, \"It's fine. I'll go check\nout the situation. At worst, I'll just\nrun away. A moment later, the host\nbrought them to the mission area, then\nloudly announced, \"Welcome everyone.\nThis is the place. Good luck to you\nall.\" Tranmack looked at the surrounding\nscene, secretly vigilant. A bit strange.\nThis forest is a bit peculiar. Walking\nto the middle of the quiet forest, he\nfroze, thinking, \"The formation is truly\nexquisite. I'm afraid it's a fourth\ngrade formation.\" He sat down\ncross-legged without hesitation, his\nhands forming seals to cast a technique.\nI'm going to study this a bit. This is\nthe first time in my life I've seen a\nfourth grade formation. A moment later,\na man suddenly walked over from afar,\ncalling out loudly, \"Brother, over\nthere.\" Luong 5 van stepped closer, his\neyes curious, yet carrying a hint of\napology as he spoke. \"Brother, are you\nalso an array master?\" \"Then I apologize\nto you in advance.\" Tranmack looked up,\nlooking at him in confusion, and asked,\n\"What do you mean?\" Just then, Tranmack\nfelt an anomaly in his soul, and his\nexpression immediately darkened. \"My\ndivine sense was bounced back. Not only\ncan people above Golden Core not enter\nthis place, but even Golden Core realm\nconsciousness is restricted. How\nstrange,\" Luong 5 Van scratched his\nhead, glanced to the side, and said with\na somewhat apologetic expression, \"Oh,\nthey're here.\" A giant snake suddenly\nrushed out in front, startling Tranmack,\nwho blurted out a curse. Damn it.\nImmediately after, a giant ape jumped\nout from behind. It's aura ferocious.\nThere's another one. Luong Fi Van\ngrabbed Tranmax's hand, saying\nhurriedly, \"I accidentally lured them\nhere. You and I take one each.\" Hearing\nthis, Tramac was stunned. Only one\nthought remaining in his mind. Where did\nthis weirdo come from? leading monsters\nstraight to my face and even splitting\none for me. Luong Fi Van had just\nfinished speaking when he turned around\nshouting at him, \"I'll deal with that\npython. This one is left to you.\" Tramax\nstood dazed on the spot, blurting out,\n\"Hey, you.\" The giant ape handily\nsnapped a large tree branch nearby,\nroaring with a ferocious gaze, looking\nat Tranmack as if it wanted to swallow\nhim whole. Tranmack did not hesitate,\nimmediately rushing up to counterattack,\nthrowing a powerful punch at its face.\nSeeing it was unharmed, he was a bit\nsurprised. No effect, Tran Mack was not\ndiscouraged, leaping into the air and\nlanding another palm on the monster's\nface. I have to punch it a few more\ntimes. Enraged, the giant ape went\nberserk, its eyes turning red, and it\nimmediately swung its arm to launch a\npowerful counterattack. Tranmack did not\nback down either, using his fist to\nblock its attack. Two forces collided\nviolently. However, Tranmack's strength\ndid not budge the monster in the\nslightest. On the contrary, he was\nknocked flying like a leaf in a storm.\nTranmack frowned, gritting his teeth as\nhe looked at the monster in front of\nhim, thinking, \"This guy's strength is\nterrifying.\" The giant ape grew even\nmore excited. It pounded its chest with\nforce, roaring loudly, as if declaring\nits invincible power. Tranmack appeared\nin front of it again, the corner of his\nmouth lifting in a provocative smile.\nFeeling excited because you're stronger\nthan me. Tranmack crouched low,\nchanneling power into his legs, then\nstomped hard on the ground, saying,\n\"I'll play with you for a bit.\"\nImmediately after, Tran shot up,\nunleashing a flurry of palms at that\nmassive body. The ape attacked\ncontinuously, roared in anger. Then it\nslammed a palm onto the ground, the\nshock wave sending rocks and soil\nflying. Tramac frowned slightly, looking\nat it, saying, \"It's just sheer brute\nstrength a bit hard to deal with.\" On\nLuong Fi's side, he was attacking the\nsnake with all his might, shouting,\n\"Take this. Taste my palm wind.\" The\nsnake took a palm hit, but remained\nunharmed. Seeing this, Luong Fian's face\nturned pale, cold sweat streaming down\nas he looked at it. \"This poison forest\npython scales are too hard. I can't\nbreak through them at all.\" Immediately\nafter the snake flicked its tongue,\nrushing straight over to swallow him. In\na critical moment, Luong Fi Van took a\nstep back as fast as lightning. Still\nwant to eat me? He raised his long sword\nhigh, diving down, shouting, \"Wind\ncontrol sword!\" Tranmack observed\nsecretly from afar. Thinking to himself,\n\"This guy is pretty good, too.\" Tranmac\nfrowned slightly, the corner of his\nmouth twitching as he looked at Luong\nFan. \"At least he has late golden core\nstrength.\" While thinking, he felt a\ndangerous aura coming from behind.\nTurning his head back, the giant ape\nonce again raised the tree branch.\nTramac reached out, easily blocking the\nblow from the massive branch, then\nmuttered, \"Do you like playing with\nsticks that much?\" Immediately after,\nthe ape used its other hand, punching\nstraight at his body. Tramac took the\nhit, gritting his teeth in pain,\nthinking it even learned how to faint.\nTramac was knocked flying near Luong\nFan's position. Luong 5 saw this and\nlooked over saying I'm done on my side.\nSeeing Tranmack injured, Luong 5 Van\nasked worriedly, \"Are you okay? Do you\nneed my help?\" Tranmack pushed himself\nup, grimacing at the giant ape and\nreplied, \"No need. I, Tranmack, have\nnever needed help from others.\" The\ngiant ape gritted its teeth, continuing\nto swing its giant fist toward Tranmack.\nTranmack gently leaned to dodge,\nwhispering, \"Rain without sound.\" The\nape paused slightly, not understanding\nwhat he was saying. At this moment,\nTranmack frowned slightly, looking at it\nwith cold eyes, and said, \"It's time to\nend this. I won't waste time with you\nanymore. Prepare to die.\" Finished\nspeaking, a giant fire dragon flew up\nfrom Trax's hand. He clenched his teeth\ntightly, channeling all his spiritual\npower into his fist, delivering a fatal\nblow. The fist struck the ape's stomach\nsquarely, punching a hole through it.\nLuong Fi Van stood by witnessing\neverything, eyes wide in astonishment,\nthinking, \"Isn't this guy an array\nmaster? Only a divine realm cultivation.\nHow can he unleash such a powerful\npunch?\" After finishing it off, Tranmack\nwalked closer to the ape's corpse,\nlooking at it and thinking, \"It's a pity\nI don't have personal storage. Carrying\nthe fire pattern saber is really\ninconvenient. Otherwise, things would\nhave been much easier.\" After that,\nTramac reached out, preparing to collect\nthe spoils. This demon ape was a golden\ncore stage beast. Its spirit core must\nbe very useful. Just then, a stranger\nrushed out from nowhere. He climbed onto\nthe ape's corpse and quickly snatched\nthe spirit core, found the treasure.\nVuang gripped the spirit core, admiring\nit gleefully. Scored some good stuff.\nTranmack just glanced at him, speaking\ngently. Did you perhaps pick up the\nwrong item? Von Fonet looked at him then\nstuffed the spirit core into his shirt.\nThis thing hadn't reached your hands\nyet. Why can't I take it? Luong five and\nstepped up in annoyance, looking at him\nwith mockery. Kid, you're being too\nunreasonable. Didn't your mother teach\nyou manners? That guy not only refused\nto listen, but also looked up and\npointed straight at Luong Fi Van's face.\nYou dare curse my mother? Luong Fi Van\nretorted without hesitation. Are you\nstupid? I'm cursing you. Then he\nimmediately drew his sword and held it\nto the guy's neck, threatening, \"Cut the\ncrap. Hand it over now or I'll teach you\na lesson.\" Seeing the sword, Vong\nexclaimed in horror, \"Is this the wind\ncontrolling sword?\" Luong Fi Van\nsmirked, smiling smugly. \"You know quite\na bit.\" Vuang broke into a cold sweat,\nthough unwilling in his heart. He had to\ntake out the spirit core and toss it\ntoward Tranmac. I am generous returning\nit to you guys. Luong Fi Van looked at\nTranmac saying, \"This guy robs people\nand still argues with twisted logic.\"\nTranmac glanced at the sword in his\nhand, asking curiously, \"What exactly is\nthe origin of your sword? Why does it\nhave such great power?\" Hearing this,\nLuong Fi Van proudly raised the sword to\nintroduce it. This is the prideful wind\nsword, ranked 43rd on the godly weapon\nranking. Don't you know that? Tr was\nstunned, asking in surprise, \"What is\nthe godly weapon ranking?\" Luong 5 Van\nexplained as if lecturing a child, \"The\ngodly weapon ranking is a list of the\nstrongest weapons in the cultivation\nworld. Only the top 100 get their names\nrecorded.\" Saying so, he gently stroked\nthe blade, continuing with a face full\nof pride. The prideful wind sword in my\nhand ranks 43rd, a peak third grade\nspiritual tool. On your Ten Kai planet,\nthere isn't anything more powerful.\nHearing this, Tramac was a bit\nsurprised. He frowned slightly,\nthinking, \"You're TN Kai Planet? That\nmeans he isn't from Tien Kai Planet.\"\nThen Tran Mack rubbed his chin and\nthought, \"It's just a peak third grade\nspiritual tool. My heaven slashing sword\nis the same. What's so impressive seeing\nhim lost and thought Luong Five Van\nquickly stepped forward, patted his\nshoulder, and sighed.\" \"Hayes, no need\nto envy me. As long as you work hard\nenough, there will be a day you own one,\ntoo.\" Tranmack brushed his hand away,\nfrowning. \"All right, hurry up and find\nthe flag. Don't let that guy from\nearlier snatch it. Luong five van\nimmediately agreed, right? No matter\nwhat, we can't let that brat find it\nfirst. Then he cupped his fists and\nformally introduced himself. Let's\nofficially get acquainted. Luong Fi Van\nof the Tonian sect. May I ask who you\nare? Tranmac also smiled, turned to look\nat him, and replied, \"Tranmac\nsect.\" Luong Fi Van quickly stroed to\ncatch up with Tramac. His tone full of\ninterest and curiosity. I've never heard\nof the OAC sect, but you're quite an\ninteresting person interested in\nbecoming traveling companions. Tranmac\ntilted his head to glance at him,\ncalculating. The Tinlon sect is an area\ncontrolled by the Tonien sect. This\nLuong Fi van can be considered a high\nofficial from the central court with a\nstatus. Why would he go deep into this\nforbidden ground? Is he uneasy about the\nTinlon sect and came to investigate\npersonally? Luong Fi Van smiled at\nTramac and asked, \"Well, then Tranmack\nraised an eyebrow slightly, extending a\nhand to him. You are a disciple of the\ntone tien sect. Traveling with you is\nalso my honor.\" Hearing this, Luong Fan,\ncorner of his mouth twitching slightly,\nthought to himself, \"Hump, but I don't\nsee any honor on your face.\" Just as the\ntwo were chatting, a strange voice\nsuddenly rang out from behind. So,\nyou're here. That person clenched his\nfist, looking at the two with eyes full\nof hatred, shouting loudly, \"You\nbastards up ahead, obediently hand over\nthe goods.\" Tranmac turned to Luong Fi\nVan, asking suspiciously, \"Did you\nprovoke them?\" Luong Fi Van quickly\nretorted, \"Are you kidding? My status is\nso noble. Why would I provoke them?\" The\nguy immediately pointed at Luong Fi Van,\nthreatening that brat with the middle\npart hair. This is nothing to do with\nyou. Get lost now or you won't keep your\nlittle life. Tranmack heard this,\nfrowned at Luong Fi Van and said, \"See,\nthey are indeed targeting you.\" Luong Fi\nVan looked at them coldly and asked,\n\"Who are you people?\" He pointed at the\nsword in Luong Fi Van's hand and said,\n\"It doesn't matter who we are. What\nmatters is the treasure in your hand.\nThat sword must be at least second\ngrade, right? Truly a precious sword.\"\nLuong Fi Van raised the sword high,\nglanced at them, and replied, \"Is that\nso? Turns out you're targeting this\nsword of mine.\" Tramax stood aside\nlooking at the group in front and spoke\nsoftly. I advise you one thing. Leave\nhere immediately. Otherwise, today will\nbe your death anniversary. Hearing this,\nthe guy laughed contemptuously, his tone\nfull of confidence and arrogance. This\nplace is a forbidden area. Everyone's\nstrength is restricted equally. How can\nthe two of you fight against eight of\nus? Luong Fi Vand gently place his hand\non Tranmax shoulder. I serious. They're\ntargeting me. Don't make a move. Watch\nhow I deal with them. The group\nhesitated no longer, immediately,\nroaring and rushing to attack. One\nagainst eight. Who do you think you're\nlooking down on? Kill them for me. One\nof them raised a long sword high,\nshouting at Tranmack. Handle him, too.\nThey rushed up in unison, but Tranmack\nand Luong Finan only moved their bodies\nslightly to easily dodge. Missing the\nhits, someone spoke up. What's wrong\nwith this kid? Why can't I hit him? What\nmovement technique is that? I must steal\nit. Tramac heard this, looked at them\nwith disdain and smiled. If you can do\nit, then come and try. On the other\nside, Luong Fi Van was also facing the\nencirclement. Go old five slash him to\ndeath. Luong Five Van countered with a\nsword strike saying coldly, just relying\non you people and you want to kill me.\nThe leader saw his companion knocked\ndown immediately shouted, \"Old five.\"\nThen he furiously raised his sword,\nroaring a command full of hatred. Let's\nattack together. Goi, pay with your life\nfor my brother. Just then, Luong 5 van\npoured spiritual power into the sword\nand a fierce blue light exploded. You\nall go die together. That strike\nimmediately crashed into the group,\nintending to continue the attack.\nTranmax standing nearby immediately felt\nsomething was wrong. Thinking, \"Not\ngood. This is a wide-range damage skill.\nGolden light body protection.\" The group\nimmediately fell at Luong Fian's feet.\nHe looked at them and laughed loudly.\nHaha, a bunch of trash. Luong Fi Van\nraised his sword, looking at Tranmack\nsmuggly. I can handle alone. Brother\nTran, are you okay? Tranmack frowned\nslightly, looking at him with a serious\ngaze. You then he gathered spiritual\npower in his palm, staring at the\nopponent. Fire pushing hand. Then he\nlaunched a palm strike towards Luong Fi\nVan shouting fire pushing palm. Luong Fi\nVand didn't understand what was\nhappening, but still quickly drew his\nsword to block the attack. Then he\nlooked at Tranmack in confusion, asking,\n\"Kid, I had good intentions to help you.\nWhy did you attack me?\" Tran Mack didn't\nhesitate, frowning tightly, retorting\ncoldly, \"You were helping me? You were\ntesting me?\" More like hearing this.\nLuong Fi Van quickly sheathed his sword\nand looked at Tranmack, replying, \"This\npersonality of yours is really\nannoying.\" Tranmack immediately\nretorted, \"You're not much better.\" Then\nhe circled behind Tranac, admitting,\n\"All right, you're very right. I just\nwant to test you. Are you really a\ndisciple of the OAC sect?\" Tranmac\nglanced at him, replying, \"I am not a\ndisciple of the OAC sect.\" Hearing this,\nLuong Fi Van suddenly laughed loudly,\n\"Ha, I knew it.\" At this moment, Tranmac\nsaid, \"I am an elder of the Oac sect.\"\nLuong Fi Van stood frozen in place\nhearing this, looking blankly at\nTranmack and exclaiming. Immediately\nafter he frowned and said, \"A sect that\nhas an elder not yet at the golden core\nstage? Is your sect leader brain\ndamaged?\" Tranmack pointed at himself\nand replied, \"Because I'm a third grade\nalchemist.\" Hearing these words, he was\na bit astonished. \"What did you say?\"\nThen he stared at Tranmack and asked\nagain, \"Third alchemist?\" Tramac replied\nindifferently, \"Believe it or not.\"\nHearing this, Luong Fi Van frowned a bit\npanicked, thinking he is actually a\nthird grade alchemist. Moreover, looking\nat his combat power just now, one can\nsee his talent is extremely high.\nThinking for a moment, he reached out\nhis hand, smiling. How about you come to\nour tone seck? We'll also let you be an\nelder. What do you think? Tranmack\ncompletely ignored this invitation\ndirectly turning around to leave then.\nNo need. Luong Fi Van quickly chased\nafter him calling. Brother Tran, listen\nto me first. He stepped up behind\nTranmack. Rambling on. Oac sect is just\na second rate sect under the management\nof Tinlon sect and its territory is just\na third grade planet. Our tone ti sect\nis different. We are on a first grade\nplanet. Even Tin Lawn sect has to obey\norders from our tone tien sect. Tranmack\npaid no attention to these words.\nContinuing his own business. Luong 5 Van\ncontinued, \"The spiritual energy there\nis five times denser than here. We can\nalso provide you with a heavenly\nparadise for cultivation, guaranteeing\nyour cultivation speed will be at least\n10 times faster than ordinary people.\nTranmack still ignored his words. Just\nlooking gloomily at the few spirit\nstones in his hand, thinking golden core\ncultivators are truly poor, only having\nthis few spirit stones. Luong Fi Van\nstood behind observing Tranmax\nexpression and continued rambling. if\nyou join us. An outer sect elder of tone\ntien sect can receive five low-grade\nspirit stones every year. Hearing this,\nTranmac gave a slight hoof, his eyes\nfinally showing some reaction. Seeing\nthis, Luong Fi Van smiled, thinking,\n\"This guy finally reacted. He became\neven more smug, speaking more\nenthusiastically.\" Third grade\nalchemist, 12 low-grade spirit stones\nper year, plus commission from selling\npills. Hearing this, Tranmack\nimmediately grabbed his hand and said,\n\"Let's go. We're going to tell him Tien\nsect right now.\" Luong Fi Van was\nstunned hearing this, blurting out,\n\"That was a fast flip.\" Then he looked\nat Tranmack, thinking, \"This guy\nTranmack, he isn't interested even in\nthe heavenly paradise that cultivators\ncrave. Didn't expect him to be money\ngrubbing. Looks like I can exploit this\npoint.\" Immediately after, Tran Mack ran\nahead, turning back to call, \"Where is\nTone Tin Sack?\" Luong Fi Van quickly\nchased after him, shouting, \"Hey, hey,\nhey, why run so fast\nfrom looking at him and said, \"Brother\nTran, no need to rush. Wait until we get\nthe flag and get the spatial ring for\nyou. Then we'll talk. That spatial ring\nis worth 100 low-grade spirit stones.\"\nHearing this sentence, Tran Mack turned\naround immediately without hesitation.\n\"Why didn't you say so earlier?\" Luong\nFive Van quickly chased after him, his\nvoice panic calling. Brother Tran, don't\ngo so fast. Wait for me. A moment later,\nthe two were still moving through the\ndense forest. Tranmax slowly spoke. This\nforest is really dense. Suddenly, he\nraised his hand, his eyes scanning the\nsurroundings, and said, \"Stop.\nSomething's wrong.\" Luong Fon was\nstunned, asking a low voice, \"What is\nit?\" The two quickly hid in a nearby\nbush. Luong Five Van turned his head,\nwhispering, \"What exactly is going on?\"\nTranmack didn't answer immediately, his\neyes looking forward, saying in a deep\nvoice, \"Look ahead.\" A group of people\nsuddenly appeared in front, surrounding\nNam Hinn and her senior brother so\ntightly that not even water could\ntrickle through. Tramac looked at the\nherbs on their backs and spoke. \"First\ngrade spirit herb, ox horn yellow. First\ngrade spirit herb, sam mushroom flour.\nFirst grade spirit herb, evergreen herb.\nSecond grade spirit herb, herb. Second\ngrade spirit herb red thread fruit.\nThird grade spirit herb nine yang herb.\nThird grade spirit herb blue star herb.\nFourth grade spirit herb water cloud\nfairy. Luong fi van heard this and\nlooked at Tranmack in astonishment\nblurting out, \"You can smell all that?\nAre you a devil?\" Tramac looked at him\nand decisively replied, \"Smelling the\nscent to identify the medicine is the\nmost basic ability of an elite\nalchemist.\" At this moment among the\ncrowd surrounding them, someone started\nshouting threats. You guys pick quite a\nfew good medicinal herbs. Hand them all\nover. Hearing this, Nam Hinn refused to\nyield, taking a step forward and saying\nangrily. You people from the Greenblade\nsect, don't go too far. My senior\nbrother and I worked hard to pick these.\nIf you want them, go pick them\nyourselves. The person heard this, the\ncorners of his mouth twitching up and\nlaughed. We came to find flags. Where\nwould we have time to pick herbs? Unlike\nyou, who even specially carried her\nbaskets? Tranmack and Luong Fi Van.\nHearing him say that, everyone looked at\neach other with doubtful expressions.\nThey had long heard of the reputation of\nthe Greenblade sect. This sect acted\nextremely overbearingly, provoking quite\na few other sections. Then, Tramac\nfrowned and looked at Luong Fi Van,\nasking, \"Won't the Tin Lawn sect\nintervene?\" Luong Fi Van revealed a\nmocking smile and replied, \"Of course\nthey will intervene. Let me tell you,\nthey have already made a move against\nthe Greenblade sect. Of course, Tinlon\nsect is doing this because they fear the\nGreen Blade sect's power is becoming too\ngreat, which would affect them. Tranmack\ncontinued to ask, \"So, what do we do\nnow?\" He looked at everyone and replied,\n\"Wait a moment for the Greenblade sect\nto kill those two. Then we will go out\nand deal with the Greenblade sect. Those\nspirit herbs will all be yours.\" Hearing\nthis, Tranmack frowned and looked at\nLuong Fi Van unhappily. What kind of\ncalculation was this? Truly disgusting.\nLuong five and raised his eyebrows,\nsmiled faintly, acting as if he saw\nnothing wrong. What's so disgusting? We\naren't killing people to rob them. We\nwant to avenge them, can't we? Tranmack\ndidn't listen to him. Then he said with\na determined look, I understand many\nprinciples on the path of cultivation,\nbut I, Tranmac, cannot do this kind of\nthing. Without hesitation, Tranmack\nimmediately jumped out from the hiding\nplace. The movement was so fast that\nLuong Fi Van couldn't react in time,\nonly able to instinctively shout, \"Hey,\noutside.\" That group of people was\nclosing in on Nam Hinn, surrounding her\nand saying, \"Hand over the herbs to us.\nThis girl must also be taken back.\"\nSeeing this, her senior brother\nimmediately shouted to stop them. \"You\nrelease my junior sister. You can take\nthe herbs. Don't touch her. Don't be\nsuch bullies.\" The group sneered,\nlaughing coldly. One of them stepped\nforward and asked back, \"What won't make\na move? I think you're tired of living.\nHe didn't retreat at all. Quickly took\nout a spirit pill and swallowed it, then\ngripped the sword in his hand tightly,\nlooking at them with determined eyes and\nsaid, \"Come on.\" They roared, rushing up\nto attack. This brat actually used a\npill, \"Brothers, get him.\" One of them\nlaughed contemptuously, raising his long\nblade high and said, holding an iron\nsword, \"And you want to fight us? Go to\nhell.\" He tried hard to block that blade\nstrike, but appeared extremely\nstruggling. The blade of the sword in\nhis hand was chopped into two pieces in\nan instant. Seeing this, he cried out in\npanic. What? That guy looked at him with\ncontemptuous eyes. His tone full of\nmockery. With this little skill, you\nwant to be a hero. Just then, a stone\nflew from nowhere, hitting that guy\nright on the head. He immediately turned\nhis head, roaring angrily. Who is it?\nWho is ruining my good deed? Before he\ncould react, Tranac rushed from behind,\ndelivering a powerful kick to his back,\nknocking him to the ground. Tranmack\nquickly subdued him, then turned to the\nother two and asked, \"Is she your junior\nsister?\" The senior brother immediately\nshielded his junior sister, answering,\n\"She is my junior sister?\" Hearing this\nsentence, Tranmack couldn't help but\nfeel a bit of sympathy, thinking, \"My\nown junior sister. I don't know where\nshe is right now.\" Then he said with a\nhint of envy, \"You guys are really\ngood.\" The guy on the ground raised his\nhead and said angrily, \"Kid, who are\nyou? Dare to step on me. Do you know who\nI am?\" His accompllices immediately\nshouted from the side. \"Release old\nthird immediately.\" The guy being\nstepped on by Transmac continued to\nscream, \"If you have the ability, let me\ngo. We will fight fair and square.\"\nTranmack glanced at him, too lazy to\ncare. Then he stomped hard on that guy's\nback, saying in a deep voice, \"When\npeople reason with you, you act like\nhooligans. Now you want to be fair and\nsquare with me. Do you guys even need\nface anymore? Kill. Hearing the word\nkill, the group was startled and looked\nover. The guy being stepped on by Tran\nMack shouted in fear, \"Let me go. I'll\ngive you all the spirit stones.\"\nHowever, answering him was a ruthless\nstomp. Next, Tran Mack frowned, looking\ndown with cold eyes, and said, \"If I\nkill you, your stuff will also be mine.\"\nThe other two saw this, looking at their\nbig brother in horror, shouting, \"Old\nthird! You killed old third.\" Then they\ndesperately swung their swords and\nrushed up to attack Tranmac. Pay with\nyour life. Tranmack was not afraid at\nall. He frowned and directly launched a\npalm strike towards them. Scorching fire\nhand. Flames immediately flared up,\nengulfing the two of them. They screamed\nin panic. Ah, what fire is this? It's so\nhot. Why can't it be extinguished? In\njust a blink of an eye, the screams\ngradually weakened, then disappeared.\nOnly a dry skeleton remained standing\nthere. Trax slowly walked up to the last\none, looked at him and said, \"Now only\nyou are left.\" That guy trembled all\nover, his legs retreating backward,\nbegging in fear. \"Hero, spare my life.\"\nI begged the hero to consider that I\nhave elders above and children below.\nTranmack didn't say much. He stepped\nforward and swung his sword across the\nopponent's neck, saying coldly, pulling\nweeds up by the roots. In the distance,\nNam Hinn's senior brother stared blankly\nat the scene before him, feeling both\nterrified and admiring, unable to help\nbut blurred out, \"So powerful. Is he\nhere to help us?\" Nam Hinn beside him\nlooked at Tranmack, replying\nexpectantly, \"I hope so.\" Just then,\nLuong 5 Van walked over, hands on his\nhips, and said, \"I'm really curious. Why\ndid you only take their spirit stones\nand have no interest in their weapons?\"\nTranmack glanced at him, replying in an\nindifferent tone. Those weapons are all\ntrash. Why take them? Luong Fi Van\npicked up a sharp sword, looked at it,\nthen revealed a mocking smile. Trash?\nTurns out you're just a money grubber\nand a money grubber with no eye for\ngoods at that. Tranmack frowned\nslightly, looking at him and asking,\n\"What do you mean?\" Luong five and\nimmediately explained, \"These pieces of\ntrash. Each sword is worth at least one\nlowgrade spirit stone. Isn't this more\nprofitable than you directly robbing\npeople of money? Hearing this, Tranmax's\neyes lit up slightly, a look of surprise\nappearing on his face, replying, \"So, it\nis like that, then I'll take them all.\"\nAfter saying that, he immediately ran to\ncollect everything. The spirit stones\nare mine. Luong Fi Van looked at Trax\nback slowly, saying, \"The beast core in\nyour hand can be sold for at least 20\nlow-grade spirit stones.\" Then he held\nup two fingers and continued. The bees\ncarcass sold to a restaurant is also\nworth dozens of spirit stones. You don't\neven recognize good stuff. Hearing this,\nTramac turned his head to look at him\nand said, \"Then I'll go get the beast\ncarcass. If you don't need the one you\nkilled, give it to me.\" Luong Five Van\nput his hands on his hips and replied,\n\"Can you carry it?\" Tramac asked in\nconfusion, \"What do you mean?\" Luong\nFive Van glanced at the two senior\nbrother and sister holding her baskets\nnearby. Don't you have those, too? Then\nhe pointed at them and said, \"Why don't\nyou take those two baskets of herbs,\nthird grade spirit herbs and fourth\ngrade spirit herbs? This is the big\nmoney.\" Hearing these words, Nam Hinn's\nsenior brother was terrified.\nImmediately stepping forward to block in\nfront of his junior sister and shouting,\n\"What do you want to do? We won't give\nthe herb baskets to you.\" He clenched\nhis fists, saying resolutely, \"If they\ndare to rob, I'll fight them to the\ndeath.\" Junior sister, you take the\nherbs back. Once master's fire poison is\ncured, you can avenge me. Nam Hinn heard\nthis, looking at him and retorting.\nSenior brother, you can't leave me\nbehind. If we die, we die together.\nTranmax stood aside, listening to these\nwords, clenching his fists, frowning,\nand said, \"All right, then die\ntogether.\" Luong Five Van stood behind,\nthe corner of his mouth twitching into a\nmocking smile, thinking to himself,\n\"Just now acting so righteous. But how\nare you different from those people?\"\nNam Hinn's senior brother took a step\nforward again, spreading his arms to\nblock, shouting, \"Don't come over. You\npeople who bully others too much.\"\nTranmack laughed, clenching his fist and\nreplied, \"Ha!\" Truly bullying people too\nmuch. Having said that, he didn't say\nanother word, suddenly throwing a punch\nlike lightning, hitting Luong Fi Van\nstraight in the face. Luong Fi Van was\nbeaten into a daze, holding his eye and\nlooking at Tranmack, asking, \"Tranmac,\nwhat do you want to do?\" Tranmack\nfrowned and said angrily, \"What do I\nwant to do? I haven't even asked you\nwhat exactly you want to do.\" Then\nTranmack stepped forward, revealing a\nfriendly smile, reaching out his hand\nand asking, \"Can you sell the fourth\ngrade spirit herb to me?\" He replied\ncoldly without hesitation. \"No.\" Tramax\nscratched his neck, looking awkward, and\nsaid, \"I'm not robbing you. Can I even\nbuy it? I just need the water cloud\nfairy inside.\" Nam Hinn cast a\nsuspicious look, opening her mouth to\nsay, \"I heard everything you guys said\njust now. Do you have money to buy it?\nYou are clearly a penniless popper.\" At\nthis moment, Luong Fi Van raised his\nhand from behind and interjected. I have\nmoney. Tramac froze for a moment,\nlooking at the two awkwardly saying, \"I,\nLuong Fi Van walked over, spreading his\nhands, acting arrogant, and said, he is\na penniless popper, but I am a second\ngeneration rich kid. Sell it to me.\"\nHearing this, Tramac frowned, secretly\ngritting his teeth, his heart full of\nannoyance. This stinking brat, I'd\nrather just rob his money. Nam Hen\nsenior brother still held the herb\nbasket tightly in his hands, replying in\na tough tone, \"Sorry, this is not a\nmatter of money. These herbs cannot be\nsold.\" Luong Five Van still refused to\ngive up, continuing to bid. How about\ntwo medium-grade spirit stones? If not,\nthen three. He didn't say another word.\ngrabbed Neam Hinn's hand, intending to\nleave. Let's go. Just then, Tranmack\ncalled out loudly to stop them. Wait. He\nturned his head, looking at Tranmack in\nconfusion. Does this brother have any\nadvice? Tran Mack frowned, looking\nstraight at him and asked, \"Is the\ninjury about to flare up?\" He was a bit\nsurprised and asked back, \"What do you\nmean?\" Tranm looked at the brother and\nsister, speaking slowly. \"Stop\npretending. Just now to win. You took a\nstep boosting pill. The side effects are\nabout to start, right?\" Sure enough, his\nbody began to tremble, his legs\nunstable. Nam Hinn hurriedly supported\nher senior brother, asking worriedly,\n\"Senior brother, what's wrong? Does that\nmedicine have side effects?\" Tramac\nfrowned, explaining seriously after\ntaking the step boosting pill. If not\ntreated in time, it will cause\ndevastating damage to one's cultivation.\n\"You were afraid of being seen by\nothers, so you've been holding it in\nuntil now. You're about to reach your\nlimit, aren't you?\" Then Tramac took a\nstep forward, offering terms to the two.\nI'll give you a choice. Use your future\ncultivation path and a pill to cure your\nmaster's fire poison in exchange for\nthat water cloud fairy. Without waiting\nfor an answer, Tranmack immediately took\nthe from Neam Hinn's senior brother's\nback. What are you doing? She\nimmediately rushed over, shouting with a\nface full of anger. Give it back to me.\nBut right at that moment, her senior\nbrother collapsed to the ground, causing\nher to stop and look at him. Senior\nbrother, senior brother, wake up. Are\nyou okay? Tranmack didn't say a word,\nraising his hand to condense spiritual\nfire, his eyes flashing with focused\nlight. Tranmack began refining a pill on\nthe spot, not using a furnace, only\nusing his palm. In just a moment, a pill\nwas formed. Luong Fi Van stood aside,\nhis mouth agape in astonishment. He was\nstunned, thinking to himself, is this\npill refining? using the palm to replace\nthe furnace to refine pills. Is there\nsuch an operation? Tranmack walked over,\nsquatted down beside Nam Hinn, then\nhanded her the pill and said, \"Give it\nto him. The problem troubling him will\nlikely be resolved immediately.\" Nam\nHinn did not hesitate, immediately\ntaking the pill and feeding it to her\nsenior brother. \"Okay.\" Tran Mack\ncontinued to guide her in channeling\nenergy. Now help him up transfer true\nenergy into his body. help him dissolve\nthe medicinal power. A moment later, her\nsenior brother's body suddenly spat out\na mouthful of blood. He woke up, looked\nup at Tranmack, and asked, \"Who exactly\nare you to be able to turn the chaotic\nmedicinal power of the step boosting\npill into my own, helping me break\nthrough my cultivation base?\" Tramac\nraised his eyebrows, looking down, and\nreplied, \"I am Tranmac.\" Nam Hinn then\nhurriedly helped her senior brother up.\nHe continued looking at Tramac and said,\n\"A third grade alchemist indeed\nextraordinary benefactor's unique skill\nof using the palm to refined pills has\ntruly opened my eyes.\" Then that person\nfrom the Azure medicine sect took out an\nitem, sincerely handing it to Tranmack.\nBenefactor needs this water cloud fairy.\nTranmac accepted it without standing on\nceremony, replying, \"Then I'll accept\nit. Tell me, what kind of fire poison is\nyour master infected with?\" He glanced\nat Luong Fi Van, his eyes full of\nweariness. Luong Fi Van looked at him in\nconfusion. The young man immediately\nleaned in a tramax ear, whispering,\n\"Azure heaven pill.\" Seeing this, Luong\n5 and curiously ran over and asked,\n\"Hey, is there something you can't say\nin front of me?\" Nam Hin immediately\nblocked his path. \"What do you want to\ndo?\" He stammered. \"I just you guys.\"\nLuong Fi Van looked at them unable to\nhide the dissatisfaction in his heart,\nshouting, \"Why are you treating me like\nan outsider?\" Hearing this, Tranmack\nrested his chin on his hand. Looking at\nthe person from the Azure Medicine sect,\nthinking, \"I pretended to be from the\nAzure Medicine sect to join the OAC sect\nand they also told me to refine this\nkind of pill.\" I didn't expect to meet\nsomeone from the real Azure Medicine\nsect today. Then he opened his mouth to\nask. The Azure Heaven pill is very\nfamous. Although the refining is a bit\ncomplicated, it's not dangerous\nanywhere. How could it lead to fire\npoison entering the body? He sighed and\nreplied, \"Our lineage of the Azure\nmedicine sect was wiped out years ago\nbecause of the Azure heaven pill recipe.\nThe recipe is also just a fragment. My\nmaster is a disciple who was lucky\nenough to survive from a lineage of the\nAzure medicine sect and has always\nwanted to restore the Azure heaven pill\nrecipe. After countless failures, master\nwas finally infected by fire poison\nduring a furnace explosion. Trammac\nlistened, reached out his hand, and\nasked further, \"So, what recipe did your\nmaster use in the end? Tell me, so I can\nprescribe the right medicine.\" The\nperson stammered this. Then he closed\nhis eyes tightly, gritting his teeth and\nthinking, \"This request is reasonable.\nBut the Azure Heaven pill is the most\nimportant recipe of our Azure medicine\nsect. Master values it more than his\nlife.\" Seeing him silent, Tranmack\nquietly took out a piece of paper,\nhanding it to him, \"Take a look at this\nfirst.\" Looking at the paper in\nTranmack's hand, he asked with some\ncuriosity, \"This is\"? Taking the paper\nTrans Tranm offered after reading the\ncontent on it, the person from the Azure\nMedicine sect couldn't help but be\nstartled. This isn't fair. I'm clearly\ntaking advantage. Transmac didn't say\nmuch, immediately patting him gently on\nthe shoulder. Anyway, just take it. He\nstill hesitated, but this. But right\nafter that, the person from the Azure\nMedicine sect tightly grasped the paper\nin his hand, shouting, \"Benefactor is\nthinking of us wholeheartedly. Yet I\ngauged the heart of a gentleman with a\nmeasure of a mean man. I will tell\nbenefactor the recipe of the azure\nheaven pill right now.\" Having said\nthat, he quickly stepped forward,\nleaning into Tranm's ear to whisper\nsomething. Tranmack listened\nattentively, his brows knitting\nslightly. After listening, he thought to\nhimself, \"So that's it.\" His master was\nimpatient to restore the Azure Heaven\npill and used spiritual herbs with\nconflicting medicinal properties leading\nto a furnace explosion and fire poison\nentering the body. The person from the\nAzure medicine sect continued sadly.\nWhen we went to gather herbs, we once\nsaw a blue tree, but there was an\nextremely powerful demonic beast\nguarding it. We didn't dare to go over.\nHearing this, Tranmack walked forward,\nsaying, \"Let's go. We're going to find\nthe blue tree. Luong Fi Van was a bit\nsurprised hearing this, asking loudly,\n\"Find a blue tree. Not looking for the\nflag anymore. You don't need the space\nring anymore.\" Then he hurriedly chased\nafter Tramax, saying, \"I still want to\nask for your help using formations to\ntrap the demonic beast so I can snatch\nthe flag.\" Tramac turned his head to\nlook at him and replied. Anyway, them\nsnatching the flag is helping you guys,\nisn't it? What's the rush? Hearing this,\nLuong Five Van lowered his head, his\nvoice also becoming quieter. It would be\nstrange if they could snatch it.\nTranmack didn't say another word,\nreaching out to grab his shoulder. Huh?\nWithout waiting for him to react, Tran\nMack dragged Luong Fi Van along, saying\ndecisively while dragging, \"All right,\nwait until we get the blue tree. If no\none has snatched the flag yet, I'll help\nyou snatch it.\" That night, the dim\nmoonlight shone down on the dark forest.\nThe four of them stood quietly in front\nof a lake. By the lake, there was a\nlarge tree emitting a soft light in the\nnight. Tranmax stepped forward, looking\nintently at the spiritual herb before\nhim, opening his mouth to say, \"This is\nthe third grade spiritual herb, the root\nof the blue tree.\" Looking at the\nscenery around, Nam Hinn couldn't help\nbut exclaim, \"It turns out this place is\nso beautiful at night.\" Luong Five Van\nstood beside her, looking at her,\nreplying, \"What's so great about this?\nMy back garden is much more beautiful\nthan this place.\" He put his hands on\nhis hips looking around and said, \"Are\nyou guys sure there are demonic beasts\nhere? I don't sense any powerful demonic\nbeast aura at all. Could you have\nremember the wrong place?\" Tranmac also\nlooked around frowning and thinking,\n\"He's right. I really don't sense any\npowerful aura.\" Nam Hinn then pointed\nahead, shouting decisively. Didn't\nremember wrong. During the day, my\nsenior brother and I picked the nine\ngrass right over there. Luong Fi Van\nlooked in the direction she pointed,\nreplying sarcastically. Truly bragging.\nThe blue tree is an object of extreme\neen. The nineyong grass is an object of\nextreme yong. How can they grow in the\nsame place? Tramac took a step forward\nand said, \"Extreme in births extreme\nyong.\" Hearing these words, Luong 5 van\nblurted out, \"What the hell?\" Nam Hinn's\nsenior brother walked over at this\nmoment clenching his fists looking at\nTranmack with a serious expression and\nsaid, \"Heaven and earth emphasize in and\nyang. The blue tree is in. So there must\nbe a yong object to balance it otherwise\nin and yang will be unbalanced.\"\nSpeaking up to here, his face turned\npale. Sweat broke out on his forehead\nand his voice began to tremble.\nBenefactor, did we cause a catastrophe?\nHe continued to analyze cold pond fire\ntree. In the fire tree, there is the\nblue tree which is an object of extreme\nyeen. In the cold pond, there is a nine\nyon grass which is an object of extreme\nyon. Suddenly, he turned his head in\npanicked to look at his junior sister.\nJunior sister, we really caused a\ndisaster. Nam Hinn was slightly startled\nhearing this, asking back, \"Cause a\ndisaster? Didn't we just pick a\nmedicinal plant?\" Luong Fi V then\ncrossed his arms and glanced at him,\nthen pointed straight at the tree in\nfront, opening his mouth to say, \"This\nmedicinal plant is like the in and yang\neyes of the Tai Chi diagram.\" You guys\npick the yang eye. This Tai Chi diagram\nhas very likely collapsed. Normally,\nafter the nine grass was picked by you,\nit should have collapsed immediately,\nbut I don't know why it's still\npreserved so perfectly. But have you\nnoticed the spiritual energy in the\nforbidden area is slowly gathering\ntowards this place. Speaking up to here,\nhe frowned slightly, his tone worried.\nI'm afraid that afterwards a major\nchange will occur in the forbidden area,\ndestroying the entire forbidden area in\nan instant. Nam Hinn listened, asking\nworriedly, \"Is it that serious? Then is\nit still in time if we return the\nnineyong grass now?\" Tramac looked up at\nthis moment, looking at the spiritual\nenergy flowing overhead, opening his\nmouth to say, \"The flow of this\nspiritual energy seems a bit abnormal.\"\nJust then, Luong Fi Van's eyes lit up,\nshouting. The heaven calculation sect\nnever miscalculates. After eliminating\nthe absurdities, he suddenly discovered\nsomething, crying out, \"Damn it, it's\njust a fox.\" Luong Fi Van confidently\npointed in that direction and said,\n\"Tranmac wore out iron shoes looking for\nit, but found it without any effort.\nIt's right on that fox.\" Tranmack\nimmediately turned his head, asking in\nconfusion, \"On a fox?\" He hurriedly\nreplied, \"It's being used as a flower\npinned on the hand by that fox.\"\nTranmack frowned upon hearing this,\nlooking thoughtfully at that fox. Luong\nFi Van then immediately drew his sword,\nhis face full of anger, saying, \"No\nwonder no one could find that flag. I\nthought there was some formation. Turns\nout this little fox is playing tricks.\"\nJust then, Tramax suddenly spoke up,\nstopping his action. Wait a moment. This\nplace doesn't seem that simple. Luong Fi\nVan frowned, looking at the fox in\nfront, replying unconvinced. It's just a\nlittle demon I can handle alone. Wait\nuntil this is over. Just obediently\nfollow me back to the heaven calculation\nsect to be the alchemist elder. Tranmack\nobserved the situation carefully, then\nturned to instruct the two siblings, Nam\nHin. You two leave here immediately. Run\nas fast as you can. Absolutely do not\nstop. Nam Hinn couldn't help but be\nscared hearing this. Asking, \"Is it that\nscary?\" Tranmax stepped forward, placing\nhis hand on the senior brother's\nshoulder, smiling confidently. I've\nmemorized your master's poison, relying\non this aura. No matter where you are, I\ncan find you. Hearing this, he hesitated\nslightly, but Tranmack quickly returned\nthe item to him, saying, \"If you don't\nbelieve me, you keep this ghost cloud\nvine first, but do not use it. Wait for\nme for 3 days. I will definitely find\nyou.\" He refused to take it back, then\nclased his hands and farewell. You must\nbe joking. A word from a benefactor is\nworth a,000 gold. I trust you,\nbenefactor. Take care. I bid you\nfarewell. We shall meet again. After\nsaying goodbye, the two of them\nhurriedly held hands and ran into the\nforest, disappearing without a trace.\nTranmack turned around, his gaze fixed\non the ancient tree ahead. At this\nmoment, Luong Fi Van had already leaped\nto the other bank, standing there. A\nhint of slight unease appeared on his\nface. Tranmac looked ahead, cracking his\nwrists. A sly smile appearing on his\nface, saying, \"Now, let me try and see\nwhat kind of fox that little fox really\nis.\" Luong Five Van glanced over with a\nstern voice. Tranmack, this little fox\nis very formidable. Aren't you going to\ncome over and help quickly? Tranmack\nsmiled, yielding the protagonist spot to\nhim. Speaking, didn't you claim to be\ninvincible in the forbidden area? Now is\nthe time for you to prove yourself. I\nwon't disturb you anymore. Goodbye.\nBeing left hanging by Tranmack. Luong Fi\nVan was furious. Tranmack, damn your\nancestors. Don't you go. While Luong Fi\nVan was confronting the monster, Tranac\nthought to himself, \"Luong Fiven surely\nwon't be defeated in a short time. I\nshould still quickly go see what\nhappened to the Yong Eye of that Tai Chi\nformation.\" Tranmac quickly entered the\nforbidden area. Tramac thought, \"This\nforbidden area is pieced together from\nInyong Tai Chi diagrams. The Tai Chi\nformation map of the blue tree and\nNanyongrass is just one of them. He\nobserved the surroundings. All the\ninyong fish eyes were connected, linking\nthese tai chichi diagrams into a hole.\nYinyangi diagram a grass pit appeared\nbefore his eyes. Tranmack recognized\nthis was the place where they dug up the\nnine yong grass. Tramac bent down and\nreached out to check. Tranmack thought\nto himself, \"Such a complex formation,\nwhy choose to use the blue tree and nine\nyong grass, which are fragile third\ngrade spiritual herbs, as formation eyes\nto support it.\" On the other side, Tula\nwas crumpled into a thin spinning ball.\nLuong Fian huffed and said, \"I knew it.\nI, Luong Fan, am an invincible existence\nin this forbidden area.\" Having said\nthat, Tua restored to its original\nstate, rushing towards him. 2 LA's power\nbecame even more ferocious, launching\nviolent attacks towards him. Luong Fi\nVan couldn't help but be alarmed, wiping\nsweat. I used all my strength just now,\nyet it isn't injured at all. Tula raised\nits claws. Of the 36 strategys, fleeing\nis the best. Luong 5 van ran for his\nlife. Suddenly, he stopped. His eyes,\ndays, his smile stiffened. Rocks and\nearth exploded. Tula burrowed out. Luong\n5 and shouted, \"Not good.\" He struggled\nto stab his sword into the rock to\nsupport himself. Luong 5 then opened his\nmouth and said, \"Cast a spell to leave\nhere first.\" Suddenly, a leaf appeared.\nLuong 5 van quickly jumped up using the\nleaf as a boat to move. While gliding on\nthe water, he discovered Tranmac. Luong\n5 then opened his mouth and said, \"What\nyou still dazing there for? Run\nquickly.\" Trowned and asked, \"Where is\nthe blue tree?\" He frowned deeply and\nsaid, \"In the lake.\" Tranmack hurriedly\nstood by the shore looking down asking\nthe blue tree and the fox both fell into\nthe lake. Luong Fan replied, \"That's\nright. I originally thought that fox\nwould struggle a bit, but as a result,\nnot even a shadow was seen. Could it be\nhiding in the water?\" Luong Five Van\nheld his head inside. Tramac frowned\nslightly. Impossible. The Tai Chi\ndiagram divides in and Yang. The blue\ntree is the Yong Eye. Under that lake\nwater is likely a sea of fire. Luong Fi\nVan was curious. You mean that fox has\nalready been burned to death? At this\nmoment, he was flustered, sweating\nprofusely. Luong Five Van asked, \"Hasn't\nthat flag been burned along with it,\ntoo? It's over. I can't become a third\ngrade formation master anymore.\" Tran\nMack calmly pointed out to him, \"Look,\nthe place where the nineyong grass was\nplanted before has lit up.\" In and Yang\ntogether give birth to the five\nelements. The five elements, Tai Chi,\nevolves into the eight triagrams. And\nnow that the blue tree has fallen into\nthe lake, the yang I has extinguished.\nWe have to see what will happen. Tramac\nadded, \"A continuous Tai Chi appeared in\nthe sky.\" Tramax said, \"Look, I\noriginally thought this was a continuous\nTai Chi diagram, but actually this\nforbidden area itself is a complete Tai\nChi diagram.\" Suddenly, his expression\nbecame sly. Tramac judged. What a grand\ndesign. Under this lake water, there\nmust be a peerless fierce thing that\nmakes the entire cultivation world\ntremble. Luong 5 van quickly caught up\nwith the thought peerless fierce thing.\nIs it that little fox? Tramac expressed,\ndefinitely not. No matter how strong the\nfox is, it is only at the golden core\nrealm. Without hesitation, Tramac jumped\ninto the lake to investigate the root of\nthe matter. Tramax said, \"The peerless\nfierce thing is sealed by the Tai Chi\ndiagram. The seal is probably about to\nbe worn down, so it thought of a way to\nbreak the formation and come out. Tramac\nused his eye technique to observe. That\nfox might just be a puppet of it. And\nthe flag is the key. The blue tree is\nthe coordinate. Tramac hurdly told Luong\nFan, \"The fierce thing won't last much\nlonger. Go over there now. Take its life\nwhile it's sick. Interested in doing a\njob?\" But Luong Fian Van was a bit\nafraid. Will it be dangerous? That is a\ngreat demon equivalent to the deity\ntransformation realm. Should we go back\nand find the heaven calculation sect\nelders to come and catch it together?\nTran max saw his suspicious manner\nreminding him, \"Did you forget the\nforbidden area restricts cultivators\nabove golden core? It's useless even if\nyou invite experts. Are you going or\nnot?\" Luong Fi Van shook his head. I'd\nstill rather not go. Seeing him like a\nshrinking turtle, Tran Mack goatated him\nagain. dignified disciple of the heaven\ncalculation sect. Yet a coward. Haha,\nyou go. Consider it as if we never met.\nTranmax shouted loudly, \"Goodbye,\ncoward.\" Then he sank into the water.\nLuong Fi Van reached out, wanted to grab\nsomething. Being mocked by Tranmack, his\nself-esteem was stimulated. He gritted\nhis teeth, sneered, and said, \"Laughing\nat me. I am the chief disciple of the\nheaven calculation sect, Luong Fi Van.\"\nLuong Fi Van stood by the shore,\nscolding incessantly. A tiny sect under\nthe star orchid sect like you guys is\nfar inferior, far inferior to my heaven\ncalculation sect. Dare to look down on\nme? Isn't it just fighting a monster? If\nI go, I go. Who's afraid of whom?\nAfterward, he jumped into the water,\nchasing after a Tramac. On Tramac's\nside, he was swimming in the water. The\ndeeper he went, the warmer the water\ntemperature became. Suddenly, his brows\nfurrowed tightly. It's like a hot\nspring. This is Tran Mack discovered.\nCould this be the legendary fire of\nwater? Then he noticed Tula was beside\nhim. Huh? This fox is also here. Could\nit be observing Tula? Tran Mack\ngradually understood. I get it. So\nthat's how it is. The Yong side of this\nThaiqi diagram relies on you to support\nit. He started to feel excited. My\nmuscles and bones need to be relaxed a\nbit. Tranmack found it more interesting\nthe more he thought about it. No matter\nwhat, I must have you. Tula looked up at\nhim. At this moment, Tula was bending\nover holding the blue tree. Tramac was\nstartled and surprised. It pulled up the\nblue tree. Is it planning to attack me?\nHe observed Tula. It used a tree branch\nto scratch its claws. Is this a fox or a\nmonkey? It even plays with a staff. Tula\nraised its claws, then turned and walked\naway. Tramac was dumbfounded. Why'd it\nrun? He curiously followed, wanting to\nsee what was actually going on.\nSuddenly, a voice rang out. The world in\nthe water is actually a world of reverse\nprojection. Tramac was pale with fright,\nscreaming internally. Where did the\nvoice in the water come from? He guessed\nit was a charm technique. Tramac quickly\nrealized it was a charm art. I must\nquickly recite the mantra to calm down.\nHe clased his hands and closed his eyes.\nThe only difference between above and\nbelow the mirror surface is the\npressure. If I adjust the pressure of\nboth to be the same, he frowned\nslightly. Tranmack mumbled. See, I've\nnever heard of this. At this moment,\nTranmax's second personality appeared.\nThe shadow Tranmac opened his mouth and\nsaid, \"Can you still distinguish whether\nyou are outside the mirror or inside the\nmirror?\" The second Tramax smiled\neerily. \"I am you, Tramac.\" Tramac was\nstartled. Suddenly, that person reached\nout, intending to pull the real Tranac.\nTramac quickly jumped up high. He was\nsuspicious. What? This shadow can even\nattack me? The shadow laughed. Tramac, I\nwas just saying hello. He surfaced\nstanding opposite Tram Mac. The copy\nwhispered, \"My point is if I defeat you,\nthen I am Tram Macack.\" Tran Mack pouted\nand retorted, \"No wonder people are\nalways looking for trouble with me. This\nface of yours really asks for a beating.\nEven I want to beat you to death.\"\nLooking at it, he laughed loudly. \"Haha,\nreally? Then what are you waiting for?\"\nAfterward, he split into four people\nsurrounding Tramac. He proposed,\n\"Whoever wins, that person is Tranac.\"\nlooking at the copies of himself around.\nTransmac thought, \"This is this silent\nfalling rain movement technique I\nlearned recently. This guy can actually\nsimulate it.\" The copy spoke,\nintentionally provoking Tranmack. Don't\nyou always feel that you returned from\nthe future and after being reborn, you\npossess an entire treasury? He\ncontinued, \"Do you think you're\nnaturally gifted? The cultivation method\nyou learn from Master Chonglu is much\nstronger than the cultivation methods in\nthe Emperor Seed Star and cultivation\nworld.\" Tranmack cast him a cold glance.\nTruly given an inch, taking a mile,\nplaying mind games, too. Then you use\nthose powerful cultivation methods to\nbully weak cultivators, admiring\nyourself in solitude, feeling smug. But\nall ends here. I will defeat you,\nbecoming the real Tramac. He made his\ndetermination clear. He quickly\nattacked, his mouth blabbering\nceaselessly. Today, I will let you taste\nyour own cultivation method. The four of\nthem shouted in unison, \"Go to hell,\nTranmack.\" They all launched moves\ntowards Tramac. Mountains severing\nTramac quickly took action to defend.\nGolden body, he smiled, followed by the\ndestruction fire stance. In the blink of\nan eye, they fiercely attacked Tranmack,\nmaking the Golden Body somewhat\ndifficult to withstand. Tramac was\nhorrified inside. Too many mountain\nseverings. I knew this mountain severing\nmove was very strong, but I've never\ntasted it myself. He laughed smuggly.\nHuh, quite persistent, aren't you? At\nthis moment, he executed shake the\nuniverse. A giant hand pressed down on\nTranmax's head. Tranmack looked\nbedraggled, his body trembling as he let\nout a grunt. He said smuggly, \"Tran\nMack, do you see? My magic can cause you\nextreme suffering.\" He opened his mouth\nagain. \"You are not from the cultivation\nworld. You and I are both from the\nimmortal world. Why must we confront\neach other like this?\" Tranmack pouted\nand scolded. \"Shut up.\" He was thicker\nskinned, talking even more. \"Don't you\nwant the fire of water? As long as you\nhelp me, I will give it to you. Tranmack\nreached out to wipe a streak of blood.\nYou are nothing but a shadow while my\nbody has undergone countless temperings\nby heavenly lightning. Wanting to defeat\nme is not that simple, the copy said\nfuriously. Then why haven't you\nsubmitted yet? Do you still not see the\ngap between us? Suddenly, he changed his\nmind. We can also shake hands and make\npeace. Let me help you get the fire of\nwater. Tranmack felt it was ridiculous\nupon hearing this. You help me? Who\nknows what intentions you have? Tramac\nraised his fist towards the fake Tran\nMack and said, \"I don't need your help.\nI will go get the fire of water myself.\"\nHe sighed. Then there is no other way. I\nmust destroy you and become the new Tran\nMac. Tran shouted in anger. You are not\nTran Mac and you never will be. The fake\nTran Mack laughed loudly, his hand\nclenching a burning fire fist. Is that\nso? Tranmack faced his copies, reached\nout his hand and shouted, \"Heavenly\nmystic divine fist, fourth form.\nMountains and rivers change color.\"\nTramac fell into thought, \"This is the\nfourth form of the heavenly mystic\ndivine fist. I haven't even used it in\nthis life.\" Before he could recover, he\nshouted, \"Great divine ability.\" Then\ncontinued to execute annihilation. Just\na few moves sent a copy flying Luong\nfive and exclaimed, \"The energy is truly\nterrifying.\" Then he drew the sword from\nhis back and said, \"This place is a\nforbidden area. The maximum energy it\ncan contain is probably only at this\nlevel, right?\" Then he was knocked away\nby a ray of golden light. He sighed\nsomewhat powerlessly, then clutched his\nseemingly injured arm, saying\nsuspiciously, \"Is this the strength of a\npeerless, ferocious beast? I hope its\nstrength absolutely does not exceed the\ngolden core.\" Tranmax stood proudly\nblocking in front of Luong Fian forming\na seal before his chin. Then Trax said\nto that person who was also his copy,\n\"You finally decided to act. Is this\nyour true strength?\" Peak late golden\ncore just one step further to shatter\nthe core and for the infant. Then Tran\nMack extended his index and middle\nfingers as if provoking the opponent.\nAre you afraid? I'm afraid this place\nisn't enough for us to unleash our true\nstrength. Let's change location. As soon\nas he finished speaking, the situation\nreversed, leaving Tranmack unable to\nreact in time. He frowned at this sudden\nchange. Then he stood up and said to his\ncopy, \"This place is our true\nbattlefield.\" The real Trax said, \"Is\nthis the mirror world? You have been\nrelying on the forbidden area of this\nworld to linger on for all these years.\"\nRight? That person rushed over\naggressively. Cut the nonsense. Heavenly\nmystic divine fist fifth form universe\ninversion. Tramac also countered. You\nhave this move too. The space became\nchaotic filled with all kinds of colored\nlights. Blue, white, red, yellow. Luong\nfive van looked confused. What is\nhappening? Then he picked up a pill and\nput it in his mouth. Then held his sword\nand flew high up in a gloomy space with\nmountains and rivers inverted. Tranmack\nknelt on one knee asking someone, \"You\nare not from the immortal world. You\ncome from a small planet called Emperor\nStar. But what exactly is the power in\nyour body? I smell the scent of space. I\nsmell the scent of time. Are you also a\nreborn person? Tranmack felt extremely\nconfused by the appearance of this\nmysterious character. Then he comforted\nhimself. No, not a reborn person. This\nis time space reversal. I must kill you.\nI have also made up my mind to kill you\nbecause you know my biggest secret. The\nmonster holding the stick walked\naggressively towards Tranmack,\ncontinuously emitting hissing sounds.\nCompared to it, Tran Mack probably only\nreached its leg. It ruthlessly struck\ndown, seeming to want to split Tran Mack\nin two, accompanied by horrifying\nhissing, hissing sounds. Tranmack also\nmade a move, chanting, \"Heavenly mystic\ndivine fist, fourth form. Mountains and\nrivers change color, and he attacked the\nmonster directly. The monster's eyes\nturned from bright red to azure blue. It\nseemed to be in extreme pain, letting\nout a roar. Tranmax stood behind the\nmonster while it was clutching its\ninjured arm. Tramac was uncertain and\nsurprised. It's actually fine. This is a\nhigh-grade spirit beast. Then the\nmonster struggled to stand up, preparing\nto counterattack Tramac. Tramac looked\nat it and judged. This guy's fur is\ndefinitely third grade spirit armor.\nWith my current strength, I can't even\nbreak the armor. The monster swung its\nstick to attack Tramac, catching him off\nguard. He hugged the giant stick the\nmonster had just thrown. The monster did\nnot stop at all, and Tr was not willing\nto show weakness encountered. The\nmonster chopped the giant stick into\nseveral segments. Tranmack looked up,\nsaying suspiciously, \"What?\" Then he\ndecisively declared, \"You force me.\" The\nmonster naturally did not want to be\noutdone, mercilessly punching Tran Mack\nin the face. Tran Mack began to make his\nmove, counting each step. First step,\nbending down to dodge the monster's\nattack. Second step, then seeing\nsomething, he asked suspiciously, \"What\nis this?\" Third step, \"Is this demonic\narts? Are you crazy? This is burning\nlife force.\" Tramac looked up at the\nmonster and asked, \"Are you afraid?\"\nFourth step, \"You'll die. Stop\nimmediately.\" Unknown what attack the\nmonster unleashed again. Tramac was\nbeaten until he was covered in injuries.\nHe thought to himself, \"Heaven defying\nseven steps. With each step taken, the\npower increases by 17. Taking a step\nleads only to death. But I cannot stop.\nI can only continue walking. After seven\nsteps, I'm afraid my chances are grim,\nbut right now I have no other choice.\nFifth step, he swung his fist to\ncounterattack the giant monster. Sixth\nstep, grabbing the opponent's fur.\nSeventh step, Tran Mack took the\ninitiative, grabbing the giant monster's\ntail. Tranmax's action affected the\nmonster, causing it to roar. Under\nTranmack's intense attack, the monster\nsurrendered, evidenced by it lying\nparalyzed on the ground. Tranmack pulled\na flag from the monster's body. For some\nreason, his eyes suddenly hurt sharply,\nand he let out a groan. The pain seemed\nto increase gradually, causing Tranmack\nto frown. Then he quickly returned to\nnormal, as if he had just discovered\nsomething interesting. He let out an\nawe. That was when he saw a few streaks\nof blood on the sword. Tranmack just\nstare at the blood streaks, muttering,\nblood stains. So that's it. The one\ncontrolling this fox is a spirit\ndevouring rat. Tranmack transformed the\nsword in his hand, then stared at the\nopponent and said, \"You saw the fox die,\nso you wanted to take the opportunity to\npossess my body. Truly wishful thinking.\nIt's a pity that the one heavily injured\nis you, but I cannot kill you\ncompletely.\" Then he coughed, squinted\none eye, covered his mouth, and said,\n\"The side effects of the heaven defying\nseven steps are actually this great.\"\nSuddenly, his body staggered as if about\nto fall, then slowly fell to the ground.\nLooking up, he saw the giant shadow of\nthat monster. Luong Fi Van walked over,\nthen turned his head to look back. Luong\nFi Van said, \"It seems a great battle\nreally took place.\" Luong Fi Van\napproached Tramac, looked down at him,\nand muttered to himself, \"So those\nterrifying energy sources I encountered\nin the lake were all emitted by this guy\nwhile fighting. He has always been\nhiding his strength. This is absolutely\nnot a divine realm cultivator. He\nclearly only has the strength of a level\none planet elder. Why would he stay in\nsuch a small oax se? This fox's fur and\nclaws are all good items. The meat has\nno use. At most, it could be exchange\nfor some spirit stones. You would\nprobably like it, right? Fine, take it\nall. However, what exactly is this\ntramax purpose? Recruiting him into the\nheaven calculation sect. Is it\nultimately a blessing or a curse? Or in\nother words, he is at most just a\n20-year-old naent soul cultivator. If he\ntruly dedicates himself to the heaven\ncalculation sect, perhaps in a few\nhundred years, the heaven calculation\nsect could also unify the cultivation\nworld. But he hides himself. This is\nlike a trap hanging by a thread. The\nlevel of danger is hard to predict.\nUnable to completely control this blade,\nyet placing all hope on this very blade.\nThis is indeed an extremely unwise\nchoice. Luong 5 van sword tip was close\nto tramac. He still hesitated the blade\nstopping in place, not moving at all. He\nmuttered again. Rather than that, it's\nbetter to destroy this blade. This is\nthe nature of the cultivation world.\nSuddenly, Luong 5 van turned his head\nback. A green-haired person had\nappeared, observing Luong 5 Van's every\nmove. The green-haired person said,\n\"Even Luong Fan of the Heaven\nCalculation sect cannot avoid\nvulgarity.\" Luong Fian Van looked at the\ngreen-haired person and said, \"I don't\nunderstand what you were saying. The\nsect style of the heaven calculation\nsect is upright. Killing people to seize\ntreasures is something we have always\ndisdained to do.\" The green-haired\nperson looked at Luong Fi Van laughing.\n\"Huh?\" \"Well,\" said I almost believed\nit. \"What are you planning to do just\nnow?\" Luong Fi Van said, \"Naturally, I\nwas saving him. He was poisoned. I was\nhelping him bleed the poison out. The\ngreen-haired person held his belly and\nlaughed loudly. H worthy of a character\nfrom a great sect. Your skin is much\nthicker than ordinary people. Luong Fi\nVan retorted with some anger. Knowing I\nam from a great sect, you still dare to\nstand here. Wait to become a ghost under\nmy sword. The green-haired person said,\n\"I followed you guys for so long. If I\ngive up now, wouldn't it be a waste of\neffort?\" hearing the green-haired\nperson's words. Luong Fi Van was\nsuspicious. tracking movement skills so\ngood that even I Luong Fi Van did not\ndetect you. Who exactly are you? The\ngreen-haired person said, \"Remember\ncarefully, I am Shadowgate\nImpermanence.\" Luong Fi Van then\nrealized, \"So is someone from the\nassassin sect ranked 16th on the\nassassin board. Shadowgate\nImpermanence.\" Next, he asked the\ngreen-haired person anxiously, \"Did you\ncome to kill me?\" Shadowgate\nImpermanence replied, \"That's right. It\nseems I hit the jackpot this time. The\nprice they offered isn't even worth the\ntreasures on you. Luong 5 van asked\nShadowgate impermanence and confusion.\nYou are clearly an assassin. Why didn't\nyou strike for behind me just now?\nAren't you afraid that after I recover\nmy strength, I will kill you in return?\nShadowgate impermanence held a small\nsword, saying, \"It doesn't matter. The\nmore strength you recover, it also\nproves the deeper you are poisoned.\"\nLung Fon was horrified. Boing, what did\nyou poison me? He thought to himself, \"I\nfeel my body gradually becoming numb.\nThis time it's really dangerous. I, the\ndignified young master of the heaven\ncalculation sect, Luong Fi Van, wielding\nthe Pride Wind Sword, ranked 43rd on the\ndivine weapon board. Am I going to die\nhere?\" Then he rose up to counterattack,\nshouting, \"I'll fight you to the death.\"\n10,000 swords homage. Shadowgate\nimpermanence looked at Luong Fi Van's\nmovements with a face full of confusion.\nThen he fell to the ground. Luong Fi Van\nrejoiced. Success. Very quickly,\nShadowgate impermanence stood up,\nregaining his composure, and said to\nLuong Fi Van, \"Then you thought too\nmuch. Didn't you say assassins must\nstrike from behind? How could I listen\nto you?\" At this moment, Luong Fi Van\nwas injured, fresh blood gushing from\nhis mouth. He asked Shadowgate\nimpermanence, \"What's wrong with that\nperson ahead?\" Then he muttered, \"It's a\nsubstitute Dharma treasure, right? I\nalso have a bottom-of-the-box treasure.\nI have to use it.\" Shadowgate\nImpermanence sneered and asked Luong Fi\nVan, \"Hey, what are you waiting for?\nI'll send you on your way peacefully\nright now.\" A hand was placed on\nShadowgate Impermanence's shoulder from\nbehind. He turned his head, shouting in\npanic, \"General Fui.\" General Fui was\nabout to deal a heavy blow to Shadowgate\nImpermanence. But he stopped him in\ntime, \"Wait, I can tell you who wants to\nkill you. I can give you the antidote.\"\nBut General Fui ignored his words and\ncontinued his action. Luong Fian saw\neverything and said, \"What a pity I\ndidn't get to hear you say who the\nmastermind is. Even now, you don't even\nhave the strength to find the antidote\nanymore.\" Rumble. Huge boulders suddenly\nfell into the river. The surrounding\npeople fled in all directions. Cries for\nhelp were miserable. At this moment, on\nthe cliff, two disciples of the green\nmedicine sect were supporting each other\nclimbing up. Nam Hinn looked down\nanxiously at the still collapsing cave\nbottom below. Can they get out? That\nsenior brother frowned slightly and\nreplied, \"Let's go back. No matter what,\nI will wait until the benefactor's\ndeadline.\" Seeing Nam Hinn still\nhesitating, he hurriedly urged, \"Go\nquickly.\" Suddenly, a few strange rays\nof light flashed from under the river\nsurface. That light emitted from a\nmirror submerged at the bottom of the\nriver. The scene shifted to Tramac and\nLuong Fian. Both were unconscious.\nSuddenly, Tramac slightly opened his\neyes and woke up. As soon as he moved\nslightly, a severe pain hit him. Tran\nMatt gritted his teeth. It hurts so\nmuch. He glanced to the side and saw a\nfamiliar figure. Leong Fifon. He\nhurriedly took out a medicinal pill and\nswallowed it. He tried to circulate his\nspiritual energy, discovering, \"Damn it,\nright now there isn't a shred of\nspiritual energy in my body. It's like a\nstagnant pool of water.\" He tried to\ncrawl to Luong Fian side and turn him\nover. He frowned slightly, still alive,\nbut looks like he's poisoned. He turned\nhis head and saw a green-haired person\nnearby. Tranmack thought to himself,\n\"Was I injured because of fighting him\ntoo? Save me?\" Tranmack took out another\nmedicinal pill. Sighing sigh in all my\nlife as Tranmac. This is the first time\nencountering something like this.\nUnexpectedly saved by Luong 5 in once.\nSince this life of mine was saved by\nyou, then I definitely must save you\ntoo. After feeding him the medicine,\nTranmack limped to the side of that\ngreen-haired person. He picked up a few\nbottles. Don't know which one is the\nantidote. Can't use this stuff\nrecklessly. Forget it. Let me go find an\nantidote for you. Tramac picked a few\nblades of grass by the roadside. It's\njust that I can't refine pills right\nnow, so I have to mix medicine for you.\nTramax stuffed a handful of grass into\nhis mouth and chewed. Today, I'll learn\nfrom Shinong tasting a hundred herbs,\ntrying a different method. The next\nsecond, he couldn't stand it and spat it\nall out. Tranmack muttered, \"Luong fian,\nendure a bit longer. I will definitely\nsave you.\" Tran walked a distance, then\nsaw a small house. He was startled,\nthinking, \"Bamboo house? Why is there a\nhouse in the mirror world? Could it be\nthe place the spirit devouring rat used\nto hide treasures?\" While walking,\nTramac kicked something. He lowered his\nhead to look. A bowl? Tranmack exclaimed\nin joy, \"Great.\" He held the bowl in his\nhand, turned, and left. With this bowl,\nI can feed a medicine. That night,\nkitchen smoke lazily rose up. A bowl of\nhot medicine was finished brewing.\nTranmax supported Luong Fi Van's head\nup. He touched the other person's\nclothes, thinking, \"This guy has good\nstuff all over him. This is a set of\nthird grade spirit armor, invulnerable\nto swords and spears.\" Trowned and said,\n\"How about I just ignore him, wait for\nyou to die, and all the good stuff will\nbelong to me.\" He sighed regretfully.\n\"Of course, I'm just saying that.\"\nTranmack picked up a medicinal herb. His\nexpression heavy. He opened his mouth\nwith some hesitation. Internal medicine\nisn't ready yet. External pus can only\nrely on chewing. He had to put it in his\nmouth, sacrificing himself. Chewing a\nfew times, he grimaced, screaming\ninside. Bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter.\nToo bitter. Tranmack was about to cry.\nOh god, my mouth has lost all feeling.\nThen he looked at the other person and\ninstructed, \"You must live. Don't let my\nefforts go to waste.\" Suddenly, he saw\nLuong Fi Van smile strangely, his cheeks\nflushing, making Tran Mack feel\nsomething was wrong. Could he be? He\nbroke out in a cold sweat from fear.\nJudging, is he a hermaphrodite? Tranmack\nopened his mouth, finding it hard to\naccept. Who would have thought the\ndignified chief disciple of the heaven\ncalculation sect is actually don't know\nif it's congenital or acquired. His hand\ntouched towards the other's neck, this\nAdam's apple of his. A long while later,\nLuong Fi Van slowly woke up. Ugg. At\nthis moment, Tran Mack was supporting\nhim. Don't move. Luong Fi Van touched\nhis neck, realizing the problem. His\nAdam's apple had been touched. So, he\nfuriously declared, \"Tran Mack, let's\nfight to the death.\" Luong Fi Van\ngritted his teeth firmly. \"Let's fight\nto the death right now.\" Tramac looked\nconfused. \"What?\" He laughed and\nreplied, \"You want to fight me to the\ndeath in your current state?\" At this\nmoment, he panicked internally. Did he\ndiscover that I know his secret? I don't\nhave any spiritual energy right now. If\nwe really fight, I'll definitely be at a\ndisadvantage. Tranmax sweated coldly and\nquestioned back, \"Why do you want to\nfight me to the death? I saved you. Is\nthis how you treat your savior?\" Luong\nFive Van's face was extremely unsightly,\nthinking, \"It's true you saved me. But\nyou, you discover my secret.\" He blushed\nand opened his mouth. You took off.\nTramac tried to pretend to be natural\nand interrupted. Just wanted to treat\nyour wounds. Besides, two men together.\nWhat's wrong with taking off a shirt? I\ndidn't take off your pants. Luong Five\nVan turned his head sharply to look at\nTranmack, full of doubt. He didn't\ndiscover my secret. Then why did my fake\nAdam's apple come loose? But I'm too\nlazy to care. Forget it. Maybe I'm\nmisunderstood. Besides, even if I wanted\nto fight, I couldn't beat him. Tramac\nadvised, \"Rest a bit.\" Luong Fian asked,\n\"Where are we going? Leaving the\nforbidden area now?\" Tranmack turned his\nhead and explained, \"Still in the\nforbidden area. This place is the world\nin the mirror located inside a mirror at\nthe bottom of the deep lake. Luong 5 van\nimmediately became very panicked.\nMirror. This is clearly a world. Could\nit be there's a small world inside this\nmirror? Depressed, right? Did you say\nthat peerless ominous beast was killed\nby someone? Tramac replied seriously,\nno. I heavily injured it. It's probably\nstill healing right now. We must recover\nour strength before it does. Luong 5 van\nwas stunned. You really only have divine\nrealm cultivation. Tranmack explained,\n\"No, I hid my cultivation. I am at the\nmid-stage golden core.\" He then rubbed\nTran's head and said, \"You actually hid\nso much strength. No wonder you could\nfight to draw with me.\" Hearing this,\nTran Mack gritted his teeth and thought,\n\"The secret hidden on you is even more\nshocking. I really want to see what a\nhermaphrodite is actually like.\" Luong 5\nvan came up with a plan and spoke.\nTramac, come to my heaven calculation\nset. I can introduce a fourth grade\nalchemist as your master and let you\nbecome an inner sect disciple. How about\nit? Tranmack asked suspiciously. Not an\nelder? He laughed awkwardly and\nstammered. Actually, an outer sect\nelers's treatment is about the same as\nan inner sect disciple. Intersect\ndisciples have more practical benefits.\nHearing this, Tranmack thought angrily,\n\"Damn it, you used a position with bad\ntreatment to lure me before.\" Tramac\nalso sighed, saying, \"Forget it. Strong\npeople in the heaven calculation sect\nare as many as oxairs. I just be an\ninner sect disciple there. In my own\nsect, I am a dignified inner sect elder.\nHow majestic. Luong 5 van turned his\nhead away and replied, \"No ambition at\nall. You have talent. Come to my heaven\ncalculation sect. It's not impossible to\npass the position of sect leader to you\nin the future.\" Tranmack laughed. You\nspeak as if the sect leader is my\nfather. However, I appreciate you\nthinking so highly of me. The two walked\na few more steps. Tramax shouted, \"Arive\nat the bamboo house.\" Luong Fi Van\nimmediately criticized. \"Is this the\ninheritance of a senior you mentioned?\nWhy does it look like a farmer's\ndwelling?\" Tranmax shrugged and replied,\n\"What do you know? This kind of great\npower pursues pure cultivation,\naestheticism. What's strange about\nliving in a place like this?\" Seeing the\nother person swallow something, Tranmack\nasked curiously, \"What are you eating?\"\nLuong Five Van replied nonchalantly.\nDon't know. Tranmack frowned and spoke\nloudly. Don't know. You don't know and\nyou still stuff it in your mouth? Luong\nFive Van said calmly and\nself-righteously. Could be some kind of\nblood stopping energy recovering healing\npills. I'm eating a bit more to recover\nquickly. Tranmack was stunned, saying,\n\"Can pills be eaten recklessly like\nthat? You really have a lot of money.\"\nTr urged, \"Go inside the house and look\nfirst.\" Entering the house, he looked\naround and couldn't help but exclaim,\n\"Huh? Why are there farming tools all\nover here?\" Luong Fi Van asked\nsuspiciously, \"Are you sure this place\nreally isn't a farmer's dwelling?\"\nTranmack touched his chin and said,\n\"Let's check another room.\" Seeing the\nother person being too casual, Tramac\nreminded, \"Why are you sitting on\nsomeone else's bed?\" He replied wearily,\n\"I'm aching all over right now. What's\nwrong with sitting a bit?\" Luong Five\nVanita sat down when the sound of\nrotting wood breaking was heard. Damn\nit. This bed actually collapsed.\nTranmack noticed something and bent down\na check. Huh? There's a basket in here.\nLooks like books inside. Tramac took out\none. The title was Heaven Heart Sutra.\nThis is Tranmack calculated internally.\nThis is the sectguarding cultivation\nmethod of the Heavenheart Dowist sect\nbranch in the cultivation world. The\nHeavenheart Dowist sect is one of the\nstrongest forces. At this moment, Tramax\nsuddenly understood. So this place is\nthe residence of a great power from the\nheaven heart daist sect. Trram showed\nwhat he found to Luong five van. Look\nthis heaven heart sutra is a great\ntreasure. He ran over excitedly. Really?\nThey're such good stuff. Tramac directly\nput the book away and said then you\ncan't touch this. I'll look at the other\nones. But unexpectedly as soon as Tr put\nthe book back it suddenly deteriorated\nseverely. What? Tramac cried out in\nsurprise. Why do they all turn to dust?\nWhat exactly is going on? Luong Five Van\nsaw this scene and laughed teasingly.\nHuh? I broke one. You broke a whole\nbasket. Is it my turn to scold you now?\nHe continued nonchalantly. No need to be\nheartbroken. Isn't it just a few\ncultivation manuals? Luong Fi Van\ncontinued to persuade. If you join my\nheaven calculation sect, whatever kind\nof cultivation method you want, I can\nfind it for you. Tranmack immediately\nlectured him. You rich bumpkin. You\ndon't understand the value of these\nbooks at all. Tranmax solemnly declared,\n\"I'm not hanging out with you nuvo ree\ntypes anymore. I'm going to check out\nanother hut.\" Seeing the other party\nbeing so decisive, Luong Five Van\nhurriedly chased after him. \"Hey, wait a\nmoment.\" Walking into another room and\nseeing the object placed in the middle,\nTranmac opened his mouth to say, \"There\nis a coffin in this room.\" Luong Fivean\nadded, \"It feels a bit desolate. Could\nthere be treasures inside?\" He seriously\nsaid, \"But it's also possible there's a\nskeleton.\" The corner of Tranmax's mouth\ntwitched, reaching his hand forward,\nthen opened the coffin, but he\nimmediately pulled his hand back,\nturning to demand of the other, \"You do\nit.\" Luong Fi Van was startled and\nquestioned, \"What did you say?\" He\nsmiled and replied, \"Me do it? Don't you\nknow how to do it yourself?\" Tranmac\nimmediately claimed credit. I carried\nyou here and I found the bamboo house.\nYou should put in some effort, too.\nOtherwise, why should the treasures\ninside be shared with you? Hearing this,\nLuongi van resignedly replied, \"Fine,\nFina.\" He began to push the coffin lid\nwith force. Tranmax stood by with\ncrossed arms, looking impatient. Seeing\nLuong Fi Van weakly and tremblingly\npushing the stone coffin lid, he felt a\nbit of disdain. Can you do it or not? Do\nyou know how to use strength? Luong Fi\nVan immediately put on an innocent, weak\nexpression. Tranmack instantly felt his\nface heat up and his heart beat faster,\ntrying to sober himself up. What am I\nfluttering for? He's a halfman,\nhalfwoman. Then Tram Macack ordered,\n\"Hurry up. Think of a way.\" Luong Five\nVan took out a box containing a puppet.\nWisps of elucory green smoke emanated\nfrom the box. Luong 5 Van closed his\neyes tight and brought his face close. A\nmoment later, the puppet gained\nconsciousness and suddenly sat up.\nSeeing this, Tranmack couldn't help but\nbe surprised. Huh? The puppet jumped out\nof the box, then gradually grew larger,\nfinally turning into a giant stone man\nwith bulging muscles. With the help of\nthe stone man, the coffin was opened,\nrevealing a beautiful woman lying\nquietly inside. Luong 5 Van glanced at\nher and asked, \"Is she beautiful?\"\nTramac frankly answered, \"Beautiful.\nThis woman ranks third among the\nbeauties I have met.\" Luong 5 Van\nchuckled and mocked her. \"There's a\nranking? You met two people more\nbeautiful?\" Tranmack calmly replied, \"Of\ncourse.\" But in his heart, he\nautomatically listed them. First is\nlittle junior sister Lackly. Second is\nYin Quinton. Then Tram Mack asked back.\nYou think she is very beautiful? Luong\nFi Van replied pretentiously. As a\nmajestic chief disciple of the heaven\ncalculation sect, \"What kind of woman\nhave an eye?\" Luong Fi Van scene. Does\nthis count as beautiful? After speaking,\nLuong Fi Van made a sarcastic remark\nwhile finding an excuse to look away.\nTruly a bumpkin who hasn't seen the\nworld. Hearing this, Tranmack ground his\nteeth in anger, but could do nothing. He\ndidn't want to argue anymore. Forget it.\nWhy bicker with a halfman halfwoman?\nAfter all, no matter how beautiful the\nwoman was, he could only look. Tranmax\nstepped forward and patted Luong Fi van\nshoulder. That is true. Young Master\nLuong is knowledgeable. I am ashamed of\nmy inferiority. Suddenly, the woman\nlying there opened her eyes wide. She\nimmediately lunged at Tranmack,\nlaunching an attack. Kill. Tran Mack\nimmediately felt the sense of\nfamiliarity in his heart. This voice was\nthe very voice that had spoken to him\nearlier. He could confirm that she was\nthe transformation of that peerless\nmonster. Luong Fi Van rushed up to\nrescue him. Damn monster. Take this\nsword. His sword slashed straight at the\ngirl's arm. But the situation was not\ngood. Her arm was as hard as rock. Luong\nFi Van sword didn't harm her in the\nslightest. Tramax struggled to grab the\nhand, choking him. At this moment, Luon\nFi Van quickly threw out several\npuppets. However, she immediately bit\nthe beast puppets to pieces. Seeing\nthis, Luong Fi Van was furious, gripping\nthe control flag tightly. Damn it, what\non earth can counter her? Suddenly, the\nflag took effect. The woman screamed in\npain, let go of Tranmack's neck, and\nclutched her face in extreme agony.\nLuong Fi Van immediately ran over to\nsupport him. Tranmac, are you okay? Wake\nup. Tranmack coughed with difficulty a\nfew times. Luong Fi Van was very\nworried. What's wrong with you?\nSuddenly, Tranmack stood up straight and\nsaid in an accusatory tone, \"You took\nadvantage of me.\" Luong Fi Van's face\ndarkened. \"When did I take advantage of\nyou?\" Tranmack cursed this halfman\nhalfwoman in his heart but stuttered\noutwardly. You you Tranmax silently\nreminded himself, \"No, I can't say it.\"\nAt this moment, Luong Five Van brought\nhis face closer. \"I know you like women,\nso what?\" Trax stammered. \"Are you?\"\nThen he found an excuse to dodge.\nAnyway, stay away from me. Luong Five\nVan sneered and followed. Stay away from\nyou. You wish. Do you want to monopolize\nthe treasure in the coffin? Just then\nthe two stopped in front of skeleton.\nLuong 5 van asked curiously, \"What is\nthat?\" Tranmack examined it for a while\nand said, \"The person in the coffin was\nnamed Tin Tra. This is his record.\" He\ncontinued, \"Tens of thousands of years\nago, this person was already a high\nexpert at the tribulation transcending\nstage. Later, he discovered a demon\nbeast slaughtering people in the\ncultivation world. That demon beast was\nextremely powerful. To subdue it, he\ncould only bring it into this mirror\nworld. And inside the mirror world, the\ndemon beast revealed its true form. It\nturned out to be a bright red female\ndog. He named it Hong Tao. Tranmack\nbegan to question life. A female dog.\nLuong Fi Van confirmed. Yes, a female\ndog. It is the very female dog you just\nranked third. Then Luong Fan turned and\nwalked away. I wonder what the two\nbeauties you ranked ahead would think.\nTran Mack immediately felt guilty,\nscolding, \"Shut your mouth.\" Tran Mack\ncontinued. \"He trapped himself and the\nbeast here, originally intending to\ncompletely subdue it, but the beast's\nnature didn't change and even injured\nhim.\" Later, he wouldn't release it even\nuntil death, eventually turning into a\nskeleton. And the beast couldn't leave\nthis place because its injuries couldn't\nheal. Luong 5n noticed. I see many bite\nmarks on that skeleton. They must have\nbeen made by the beast to vent its\nanger. Seeing this, Tran Mack was\nendlessly astonished. So many years have\npassed. Its power has decreased to a\nlevel equal to ours. Yet, it still can't\nleave here. Luong 5 Van said in a\nreproachful tone, \"Where's the treasure\nyou mentioned?\" Tranmack didn't answer,\njust humming and hawing to cover it up.\nBut Luong 5 Van said irritably, \"Fine,\nif there's no treasure, but so many of\nmy precious items were destroyed saving\nyou. Tell me how you should compensate\nme.\" Saying this, he smuggly took out\nhis control flag. After all, it is only\nafraid of this. At this moment, Tran\nMack put his arm around his shoulder,\nsaying affectionately, \"We are brothers.\nWhy fuss over these worldly possessions?\nAs long as the people are here, the\nfriendship remains. What is more\nimportant than that?\" Luong 5 and also\nsoftened a bit. What do we do now?\nTranmack rubbed his chin and said,\n\"Currently, the restriction outside is\nprobably about to disappear. By then the\nheaven and earth spiritual energy can\nalso flow into this mirror world.\nSpeaking of this, his expression became\nserious. At that time that female dog\nstrength will recover quickly. Once it\nrecovers, we will definitely die. Luong\nFi Van asked. So we take advantage of\nthe time before it recovers to kill it.\nTramac confirmed. Correct. He pointed at\nLuong Fi Van's flag. There is something\nin this flag that the female dog fears.\nYou study what's inside a bit and I will\nstand guard for you. Thinking for a\nmoment, Luong Fi Van agreed. All right,\nthere's no other way. Immediately after,\nLuong Fan sat in meditation to circulate\nhis energy. Tranmack watched him\nintently as if calculating something. At\nthis moment, Tranmack bit his finger and\nsaid, \"Now, let's try dripping blood to\nclaim ownership.\" A drop of blood fell\nonto the ring, but it didn't have any\nreaction, which made Tranmax surprised.\nNo reaction. He put the ring back on his\nhand. Forget it. I'll study it later.\nThen he stepped into the coffin, looking\nleft and right, wanted to see if there\nwas anything else. He sat down and\nreached out to grab something. Suddenly,\na gentle voice rang out, startling him.\n\"Young man, I'm already a skeleton. Why\ndo you still want to torment me?\"\nTranmack trembled and shrank into the\ncorner. \"Who are you?\" The soul of an\nold man appeared. \"Who am I? I am a\nskeleton you are rummaging through.\"\nTranmac surroundings also turned into a\nlush green meadow. He asked in panic.\n\"Where is this? Are you old man Tandra?\nYou aren't dead. Old man Tanrake\nreplied, \"Eternal years are but a\nthought. Young man, do not fear. I've\nbeen dead for many years, and now only a\nwisp of remnant thought remains.\"\nHearing this, Tranmack immediately\nrealized the anomaly. The remnant\nthought of old man 10 tra judged\narrogantly, \"Crect the heaven world has\nchosen you, so naturally it will discard\nme. My remnant thought must be about to\ndissipate.\" Tranmack raised a hand\nwearing the ring and spoke up. Heaven\nworld, this iron ring. The old man's\nface revealed some admiration. I truly\nadmire you. I spent so much effort in my\nentire life, but failed to become the\nmaster of this heaven world.\nUnexpectedly, it recognized you.\nTranmack immediately asked curiously,\n\"This, what is the use of the heaven\nworld?\" Old man Tien TR quickly\nexplained, \"Possessing the heaven world\nis like possessing a real world. Rays of\nlight gradually converged into the ring\non his hand. The old man declared, \"Son,\nmoon, and stars, mountains, rivers, and\nearth. This is a real world, and you are\nthe master of this world.\" Tranmack felt\na stream of power gradually pouring into\nhis body. A power so vast it seemed\ncapable of encompassing the whole world.\nA moment later, he suddenly opened his\neyes, sobering up. Everything around\nreturned to its original state. Tranmack\nimmediately looked at the ring with joy.\nBig profit, he exclaimed a bit. In my\nprevious life, I didn't have such good\nspiritual energy to use. Suddenly, a\ncurrent of electricity flashed inside\nTranmax body. He immediately realized\nsomething was wrong. Something was about\nto happen, about to break through. While\nLuong Fi Van was focusing on\ncultivation, he sneaked out, then sat\ndown, preparing to absorb the power.\nEverything around transformed again.\nTranmax sat on a towering giant rock.\nThen a giant golden ball of light\nappeared in the sky. The power around\nthe ball slowly radiating out. That\nground her teeth in rage. I spent\nso much effort to control a fox to have\nit carry the flag and help me break the\nformation. Seeing success was imminent.\nIt immediately rushed towards where Tran\nMack was cultivating. It's all because\nyou ruined my plan. Tranmac also sensed\ndanger approaching. Not good. Suddenly,\nthe sword inside his body flew out,\nattacking the The\nimmediately landed to dodge the attack,\nstaring at him with hatred. Now is the\nbest time to kill you. It happened in a\nflash. She lunged fiercely, wanting to\nbite him, but a different dimension\nsuddenly opened up, causing her to lose\nmomentum and fall into that space. Not\nonly that, she was extremely excited.\nWonderful. The spiritual energy in this\nworld is so abundant, completely\ndifferent from that mirror world. Then\nthe sucked all the spiritual\nenergy in her body, speaking\nferociously. You just wait. I'm about to\nrecover to the deity transformation\nstage. That will be the day you die. At\nthis moment, Tramax's face looked\npained. Damn it, that crawled\ninside. My nent soul hasn't fully\nemerged yet. I need time. However, that\nhad already walked up to him with\na sinister smile. It's a pity the guy\ninjured me too heavily. I can't improve\nany further. She rushed forward with\nimmense confidence, but this level is\nenough to kill you. She had yearned for\nthis day for a long time, rushing over\nwith astonishing speed. I want to eat\nyou alive. Then she opened her bloody\nmouth wide like a sacrificial bowl,\nrevealing sharp teeth, seemingly wanting\nto swallow him whole. A newly emerged\nnaent soul is the most delicious thing\nin the world. The giant monster, Tula,\nrushed forward with a mouth full of\nsharp teeth, biting down hard towards\nTranmack without hesitation.\nUnfortunately, his reaction was too\nfast, disappearing without a trace in\njust a second. Because of this sudden\ndisappearance, Ta was stunned, looking\naround to search. Huh? Ta discovered\nthat Tran Mack was now sitting\npeacefully on a cliff. She ground her\nteeth. This guy has spatial power on\nhim. Tranmack was extremely calm, eyes\nstill closed, meditating peacefully.\nTula suddenly jumped up, roaring. Give\nall the power to me. But Tranmack could\nstill easily dodge the attacks without\nwasting any effort. He was like\nlightning weaving through the steep\ncliffs, leaving only a desperate roar\nbehind. Don't run. Tula chased closely\nbehind, shouting while chasing. You\ncan't escape. Tranmack faced her firmly.\nThe world was fine until you turned it\ninto this. You just wait. I won't\nforgive you. The monster's eyes became\nferocious. She roared, \"Don't run if you\nhave the guts.\" Tula used her clawed\npaws to attack Tranmack, startling him.\nTranmack looked at his abdomen in panic\nwhere his golden core was located. He\nwas a bit flustered. My golden core\nfeels like it's about to crack. Tula\nground her teeth. You're not dead yet.\nShe immediately continued her moves,\nslapping down a heavy palm, shaking the\nground until it cracked and collapsed.\nLuckily, Tranmack reacted quickly enough\nto escape. Otherwise, he might have lost\nhis life. Tula went completely mad,\nstarted to unleash her real moves. Die.\nHeavenly Dog howls at the moon.\nUnfortunately, this time, Tran Mack\ncouldn't dodge the attack and took a\nhit. Tran Mack fell to the ground. The\nmonster looking at him triumphantly.\nCan't run this time, right? Tula\ntransformed back into the appearance of\na little girl at this moment, mocking\nwith a laugh. Kid, fighting with me.\nYou're still too green. Tranmax's heart\ntightened because a strange phenomenon\nsuddenly occurred in his body. Damn it,\nmy golden core shattered. But why did\nchild appear? Tula smirked, raising her\nhand to finish off her opponent. Go to\nhell. She jumped up, punching towards\nTranmack. But suddenly, an invisible\nlayer of armor appeared around him,\nblocking the attack. Tula was stunned.\nWhat is this? Tula couldn't believe her\neyes. This guy broke through to the nent\nsoul stage. Tranmax slowly stood up,\nclenching his fists. This place is my\nworld, and you have destroyed my world.\nTran Mack couldn't hold back his roar.\nDo you know how much I like this world?\nTula stubbornly rushed forward again.\nWho cares about you, Zu Anoying? Just\ndie. Tran Mack launched a counterattack\nthis time, knocking Tula back. Not that\neasy. He channeled his power and said,\n\"Now it's your turn.\" The scene before\nthem left one speechless with shock.\nTula seemed frightened by this threat,\ntransforming back into her beast form\nand turning to run. Tranmack shouted,\n\"Don't you run!\" Tula turned her head\nback to look. Tranmack immediately\nrushed over and punched her. \"Were you\nlooking?\" Tranmac used the power of\nflames to strike a blow. Tula was hit in\nthe face, screaming in pain. She tried\nto resist, howling loudly. Tranmack was\nabout to continue attacking when Tula\nquickly fled. Tranmack shouted, \"You\ncan't escape.\" Tranmack was full of\nresentment. Look at my world. Look at\nwhat you've destroyed it into. I'll\nfight you to the death. Tula was\nunwilling to be wrongly accused, arguing\nback while running. You shameless guy.\nClearly, you broke more of it. Tranmax\nsaw an opening immediately creating a\nrope to bind two law tightly. The\nopportunity had come. Tula was caught\noff guard, caught in the trap, and held\nmiserably. Tula was tied up, lying flat\non the ground. Tranmack held the end of\nthe rope, threatening. Behave yourself.\nhand over the origin power in your body.\nTranmack threatened, \"Wait until I reach\nthe tribulation transcending stage. Then\nyou can go wherever you want. How about\nthat?\" Tula was a bit worried, thinking\nto herself, \"It took me a 100,000 years\nto cultivate to the tribulation\ntranscending stage. Relying on you. Who\nknows how many years and months it will\ntake?\" She immediately struggled,\nrefusing. \"Keep dreaming.\" Tranmax\nscratched his head, falling into\nthought. Looks like the negotiation\nfailed. Maybe I should return to reality\nfirst and think of another way later.\nNight fell. Tranmack put his hands in\nhis pockets. Walking to a place that\nlooked like a thatch hut. He looked\naround and said, \"I wonder how Luong Fi\nVan's enlightenment is going.\" It was\nLuong Fi Van practicing cultivation. He\nasked him if he was shattering his core\nto form his soul. But Luong Fi Van\ndidn't answer. Tramax shook the other\nperson worriedly. Luong Fi Van, stop\nimmediately. Let's leave here before you\nbreak through. There's no spiritual\nenergy here to support your\nbreakthrough. Something bad will happen\nat this moment. Luong five and opened\nhis eyes, cheeks flushed, eyes brimming\nwith tears. Tranmac asked worriedly,\n\"Huh? What happened? Is the lady boy\nabout to reveal his true form?\" Tranmac\nimmediately pulled Luong Fan's hand,\nurging, \"Get up quickly. We're leaving\nright now.\" Luong Fi Van struggled,\ncrying as he spoke. \"I can't&lt;unk&gt;t stand\nup.\" Tran got angry. \"What are you going\ncrazy for? If you don't stand up, I'm\nleaving alone. Luong Fi Van said\nangrily. I told you I can't stand up.\nAre you deaf? Tramac finally breathed a\nsigh of relief. He smiled and said, \"Now\nthat sounds like a human.\" Luong Fi Van\nsaid. In that flag, two worlds fused\ntogether. The power of those two worlds\nflooded into my body, forcing me to\nbreak through. Tranmack frowned in\nthought. Two worlds? Could this flag be\neven better than my heaven world? Luong\nFive Van gritted his teeth, crying in\nfear. But there is no spiritual energy\nin either of these two worlds. Am I\ngoing to die? Tranmax scolded in\nannoyance. Stop crying and then getting\nangry. It's scary. Tramac looked at\nLuong 5 and clutching his stomach.\nLooking very exhausted, thinking,\n\"Neither of his two worlds has spiritual\nenergy. No energy to shatter the core\nand form the soul. He might really die.\nShould I use the spiritual energy in my\nheaven world to help him?\" Suddenly, he\nshouted hurriedly, \"There are spirit\nstones in my belt. Tramac, hurry and\nhelp me take the spirit stones out.\"\nTramac was a bit suspicious, but still\nbent down to grope around his belt.\nHowever, his thoughts were a bit\nstrange. Why does his waist feel so\nsoft? Perhaps because of the touch.\nLuong Fi Van's face also turned red. He\nroared, \"Hurry up. Can you be a bit\nfaster?\" Tranmack retorted, \"Don't rush\nme.\" His hands continued groping around\nhis waist, looking for the item,\nsecretly cursing in his heart. Damn, how\ncan it be so soft? Tramax seriously\nsurged for the spirit stones. He felt\ninside, thinking, \"This guy is really\nrich. He used so many treasures to save\nme earlier, yet he still has this much\nleft.\" Then he grabbed a bag and\nshouted, \"Found it?\" He asked again,\n\"These are your spirit stones, right?\"\n\"Yes.\" Luongfi Van fell tiredly on a\nTranmack and said, \"I can't move at all.\nYou absorb the spirit stones, then\ntransmit the spiritual power into my\nbody.\" Tramac held the item and nodded\nin agreement. I understand. Tramac began\nto do as Luong Fian said, transmitting\nspiritual power to him. Luong Fian\nblushed and cried out. So comfortable.\nTramac felt a bit nauseous and scolded.\nStop making those disgusting sounds. He\ndidn't care and replied, \"Cut the crap.\nKeep going.\" A moment later, more and\nmore spiritual power was transmitted.\nLuong Fi Van's power was brimming and he\ncheered happily. Third grader array\nmaster nent soul realm. I broke through\nseeing Tranax's hand still on his back.\nLuong Fan asked Tranmax suspiciously.\nWhat's wrong? You can let go now.\nTranmack explained with a pale face. I\nwant to let go too, but why can't I pull\naway? Luong Fan was surprised. What?\nTranmack hardly explained. Your body is\nstill absorbing my spiritual energy.\nLuong 5 closed his eyes and said, \"Wait\nfor me to check the situation.\" He\nexplained, \"I know.\" After condensing\nthe banner, these two worlds have become\none with me. Because these two worlds\nhave no spiritual energy, they are\ncurrently using my body as a\nbreakthrough point. Sucking your\nspiritual energy over there. Tran\nmacraed, I saved you. Why am I\nencountering this trouble again? Luong 5\nvan rummaged for things and said, \"Don't\nworry. I will also absorb spiritual\nenergy. Let's fill up this world\ntogether.\" Tramac was suspicious. Fill\nup? He replied, \"Stop talking nonsense.\nHurry and take out more spirit stones.\"\nThen the two continued to find spirit\nstones on Luong Fian's body, consuming\nmore and more spirit stones. We spent so\nmany spirit stones already. Tranmac\nturned to Luong Fi Van, asking\nsuspiciously with a darkened face, \"Why\nhasn't it stopped yet? Are you sure we\nwon't be sucked dry in mummies?\" Luong\nFi Van gritted his teeth and replied, \"I\ndon't know either,\" he explained.\nAlthough these two worlds seem to have\nbecome a part of my body, I can't fully\ncontrol them. Tran Mack pondered, should\nI use the spiritual energy of the heaven\nworld, but if he finds out and reports\nit to the heaven calculation sect, I'm\ndone for. He was a bit worried, but if\nthis continues, neither of us will\nsurvive. Sigh. So troublesome. Suddenly,\nhe laughed loudly. Luong Fi Van, you\nbrat, you're in luck. Consider it that\nI, Tranmac, owed you in a past life.\nLuong Fi Van turned his head in\nconfusion. Huh? Luong Fi Van asked in\npuzzlement. What did you say? What do\nyou mean owed me in a past life?\nTranmack immediately replied, \"Do I need\nyour permission?\" Saying so, he struck a\npalm on a Luong 5 van's back and a\nbrilliant golden light appeared. Luong 5\nvan let out a hum. A scene appeared. Two\ntorrents of fire and water colliding.\nTranmack frowned, his eyes lighting up,\ngradually becoming serious. Seeing the\nscene before him, Tranmack hesitantly\nasked, \"This is Luong 5.\" Van smiled\nwith squinted eyes, then reached out to\nintroduce it to him. \"Is it shocking?\nOne side is a world of lava, the other a\nworld of water. Water and fire\nintersect, yet do not dissolve into each\nother.\" Tramac fell into deep thought\nafter hearing this, but still replied,\n\"Water fire.\" So the water fire lies\nwithin this banner. The two of them\nlooked towards the vortex of interlaced\nwater and fire. Tranmack observed and\nspeculated. Old man Tien Trake was\nreally heavy-handed. It seems to be\nright there. Luong 5 was puzzled. What\ndo you mean? Tranmack jumped into the\nwater without hesitation, not forgetting\nto announce. I want to go take a look.\nSeeing this, Luong Five and panicked and\nshouted, \"Wait for me.\" Suddenly, a\nmocking voice came from behind,\nattracting Luong Five Van's attention.\nTurns out to be a daughter's body. Luong\nFive and broke out in cold sweat. turned\naround and shouted, \"Who is it? Get out\nhere.\" A creature like black smoke\nbearing a ferocious face surrounded\nLuong Fi Van, sneering in reply, \"We are\nall women. Can't we live together in\npeace? Why be so fierce with me hearing\nthis?\" Luong Fi Van immediately said,\n\"Don't you want to kill Tranmacked?\"\nHer eyes sharp, carrying a hint of\narrogant mockery as she replied, \"The\ntime to kill him has not yet come. Wait\nuntil the spiritual energy of this world\nis balanced. You can kill him as easily\nas turning your hand. However, Luong Fi\nVan hesitated at this moment, but Tramax\nsaved me. Luong Fian was about to\ncontinue. Tula asked back, \"Do you know\nwhat he used to save you?\" Tula\nimmediately explained, \"He has a world\nmore perfect than yours. Two LA's eyes\nlit up, red as blood.\" Tula continued,\n\"That place has sun, moon, and stars,\nrivers, and mountains. Is a true world.\"\nLuong Fan repeated. A true world. Luong\nFi Van looked up and asked, \"A true\nworld? A true world? If you sees that\nworld, Tula tilted her head, looking at\nLuong Fi Van, and said, \"All crises of\nthe heaven calculation sect can be\neasily resolved. When that time comes,\nyou won't have to work so hard anymore.\"\nLuong Fi Van lowered his head, immersed\nin his thoughts, and Tula continued,\n\"Restore your female identity. Regain\nyour freedom, go wherever you want, just\nkill him.\" Luong Fi Van pondered, \"Kill\nhim.\" On one hand, Luong Fi Van's eyes\nbecame slightly moist, repeating, \"Kill\nhim!\" On the other hand, fear made his\nface pale. Luong Five Van hesitated.\n\"This is waterfire.\" On the other side,\nTran Mack was hovering in midair,\nsurrounded by a swirling vortex of water\nand fire. Tranmack looked at the blue\nenergy mass resembling a burning flame.\nHe asked softly, \"Do you want to follow\nme?\" He reached out his hand and\ncontinued, \"Let's conquer the world\ntogether.\" Seeing that stream of energy\napproaching him, Tranmack placed his\nhand on his chest, asking happily, \"You\nagree?\" Tranmac remained hovering in the\nair. Seeing the energy surrounding him\ngrowing stronger, he was extremely\nastonished. Below was still the\ncollision of water and fire. Tranmack\nraised both hands, speaking with an\nexpression of disbelief. \"I got the\nwater fire.\" The scene became bright.\nTranmax said, \"Water, fire. Remove the\nrage of fire. Erase the coldness of\nwater.\" Tran covered his mouth with his\nhand, recalling Dong Hoa, heavenly\nemperor, once saying, \"Water and fire\ncoexist, warm as spring. I really want a\nwater firefl.\" Then he said, \"Little\njunior sister, wait for me. I will use\nthis water firefl as a gift for you.\"\nTramax smiled, thinking to himself,\nJunior sister, I will give that gift to\nyou. Suddenly, a beam of golden light\nflew straight over, stabbing accurately\nat Tranmack. He was so scared his face\nturned pale, cold sweat on his forehead.\nTranmack frowned, looking unhappily in\nthat direction. Turning his head, he saw\nLuong 5 and clutching the sword in his\nhand. He felt it was strange and asked,\n\"Luong 5 Van, what are you doing?\" Luong\nFi Van remained silent, just raising the\nsword high, his body surrounded by a\nglowing blue airflow. Right at this\nmoment, Luong 5 Van swung the sword,\npointing straight at Tran Mack, hovering\nin the air. A huge aggressive beam of\ngolden light shot out. Tran Mack quickly\ndodged, then he shouted, \"Luong Fi Van.\"\nTranmack held his chest. He speculated\nthe wound was still emitting cold. \"Is\nthis the power of the waterfire world?\"\nTranmack landed on the ground, gripping\nhis clothes, watching Luong Fi Van swing\nhis sword to slash out a ray of light,\nthen asked, \"Are you crazy?\" Immediately\nafter, Tranm's expression became\nextremely furious. He raised his fist\nand shouted, \"If I don't give you a\ntaste of my power, you won't know how\nmany eyes Lord Ma has.\" The two attacked\neach other simultaneously. Tranmax stood\nbelow, raising a pillar of blazing red\nfire, striking towards Luong Fian. On\nthis side, Luong Fi Van did not show\nweakness, swinging his sword to shoot\nout a beam of blue energy with\nunparalleled power. At this moment,\nLuong 5 Van saw his sword crack a\nlittle, asking in astonishment, \"Nent\nsoul? You're also a nent soul?\" Luong Fi\nVan was extremely furious after\nrealizing this. Luong Fianne frowned,\nhis eyes gradually becoming sharp,\ngritting his teeth and saying, \"Tranmac,\nsure enough, you are deceiving me. What\nexactly have you been hiding?\" Finished\nspeaking, Luong Fi Van carried the sword\nand flew straight towards Tranmack,\nquestioning continuously, a nent soul\ncultivator, yet disguised as spirit\nrealm cultivation. Are you a spy sent by\nthe wind dowo sect to cause disadvantage\nto our heaven calculation sect? Tranmack\nlooked a bit disdainful at this moment,\nreplying, \"Is that all? What\nwind thou sect? I don't know them at\nall.\" Immediately after, Tranmac\ndecisively pushed Luong Fi Van into the\nsea of fire. He thought to himself in\nthis world, \"I can't beat him. I must\nget out quickly.\" Luong Fi Van flew up\nfrom below into the air, sitting on top\nof a giant fire dragon, then reached out\nand ordered, \"Don't run.\" Tranmack\ncouldn't help but turn his head,\ngritting his teeth and exclaiming, \"Damn\nit. Has the spiritual power of this\nworld become this dense?\" Saying that,\nhe quickly flew towards the red hand in\nthe sky, replying, \"Not playing with you\nanymore. Goodbye.\" The scene shifted.\nTramac patted Luong Fi Van's shoulder,\nspeaking up, \"Ah, we're back.\" He\ncontinued to pat Luong Fi Van's shoulder\nas if to remind him, \"Seems like you can\nmove now.\" Luong Fi Van turned his head\nto glance at him, saying irritably,\n\"Don't think about shaking me off.\" Then\nLuong Fi Van turned to face Tranmack.\nContinuing, \"Don't think about running\naway.\" Finished speaking, Tranac was\nhugged by Luong Fi Van, leaving him\nstunned. He hardly cried out, \"Hey,\nhey.\" The scene shifted. Luong Fi Van\nand Tranmac appeared in another place.\nHere, the grass was lush green with\nrolling hills in the distance. Luong Fi\nVan was a bit surprised seeing this\nscene. Luong Fi Van looked around unable\nto help asking, \"Is this that complete\nworld? It's too perfect, right?\" Luong\nFi Van spread his arms to enjoy it. If\nthe heaven calculation sect can seize\nthis world, we will be saved. Behind\nhim, Tranmac was observing with a frown.\nTramac was thinking about something, his\nface darkening. Luong Fi Van suddenly\nturned to look at him, gritting his\nteeth and ordering, \"Tran Mack, hand\nover this world, and I can spare your\nlife.\" Tramac then said softly, \"You\nright now compared to those bandits who\nkill and rob. What is the difference?\"\nHearing this, Luong Fi Van, his body\nstiffened, a look of disbelief on his\nface. At this moment, Tranmac frowned,\ncontinuing, \"Seriously, killing and\nrobbing. Is this your true self?\" Luong\nFi Van hesitated a bit and asked back my\ntrue self. Luong Fi Van recalled the\npast. Sage Ton Tong once said, \"Fan, the\ngreat tribulation of the heaven\ncalculation sect is coming. If we don't\npass it, we will vanish like smoke. If\nwe pass safely, we can ascend to the sky\nin one step.\" He continued, \"And you are\nthe key to this tribulation. Fian, are\nyou willing to shoulder this heavy\nresponsibility?\" Sharp eyes flashed. The\nmemory ended. Luong Five and clench his\nfists, declaring furiously, \"That's\nright. I want to be my true self again.\"\nSuddenly, a voice came from unknown\nwhereabouts. The cultivation world is\noriginally the strong eating the weak.\nWhat does killing one person count for?\nA giant spirit beast appeared in the\nsky. It bared its sharp teeth with a\nblue pattern on its forehead. It looked\ndown at the two people below,\ncontinuing, \"Only by becoming stronger\nyourself can you control your own\ndestiny.\" Hearing this, Tranm shouted\nloudly, \"Stop talking nonsense. If you\nkeep babbling to me, I'll beat you to\ndeath.\" Tranm turned to the confused\nLuong Fi Van again, saying, \"Luong Fi\nVan, you saved me twice. I also saved\nyou twice. Let's consider it even today.\nI won't kill you. You go finish\nspeaking.\" Suddenly, a puff of pink\nsmoke appeared, hovering in midair,\nwrapping around Tranmack. Seeing this,\nhe said in horror, \"This is this is\naphrodesiac poison.\" That spirit beast\ngritted its teeth and replied, \"Correct.\nNo need to struggle anymore. Based on\nyour current cultivation, you basically\ncannot resist lover's tear.\" In an\ninstant, the aphrodesiac poison also\nspread to surround Luong Fi Van. Luong\nFi Van immediately turned into a woman.\nWitnessing the scene before him, Tranmac\nwas extremely astonished, shouting, \"You\nare not a halfman, halfwoman. Watching\nLuong Fi Van shily lower her head, Tranm\nstammered, also not a man, not giving\nTransmac a chance to continue, Luong Fi\nVan lunged forward, hugging Tranmack\ntightly. He fell backwards, blurting\nout, \"Wait.\" Luong Fi Van's face\ndarkened, replying, \"My name is Luong Fi\nVan. Fi as in flying dance. Van as in\nthe multitude of living beings.\"\nTranmack hurriedly advised, \"Take it\neasy. You are poisoned right now. We are\nboth poisoned.\" Without waiting for\nTranmack to finish, Luong Fi Van rushed\nup, lifting his face and kissing him\ndeeply. Tranmack instinctively closed\nhis eyes. The spirit beast saw his\nattitude, narrowed its eyes, and\ncriticized, \"Tran Mack, have you\nforgotten your little junior sister?\"\nHearing this, Tranmack thought to\nhimself, \"Little junior sister.\" Luong\nFive Van maintained the posture. The\natmosphere around the two filled with\nambiguity. The spirit beast continued.\nYou already have Yin Quinton. Now adding\nanother woman is doing this worthy of\nyour little junior sister lack lily. The\nspirit beast continued aggressively.\nIsn't she your wife? Didn't you once\nswear that you would definitely find her\nin this life? Have you forgotten it all?\nTranmack looked doubtfully at Luong Fi\nVan in his arms. Reasonz told him he\ndidn't want to, but his body couldn't\npush her away. The spirit beast grinned\nbroadly. You are a despicable villain\nhaving the mouth of a Buddha but the\nheart of a snake. You don't love your\nlittle junior sister at all. Tranmack\nclenched his fists listening. Mouth of a\nBuddha heart of a snake. You are a\nvillain. You fundamentally don't love\nher anymore. Hearing the last sentence\nthat she was his wife. Tranmax face\nturned livid. Tula saw its goal was\nabout to be achieved. Sneered in\nthought. His spirit wavered. I will be\nable to escape very quickly. He said we\nare all strangers. I won't take\nresponsibility for you. Luong Fi Van\nseemed not to care at all. She snuggled\nclose to Tran Mack saying, \"You saved me\ntwice. I saved you once. I still owe you\na life.\" Her action made Tranac blush.\nHe asked, \"What do you mean? Didn't we\nsave each other twice?\" Luong Five Van\nleaned even closer, saying, \"Actually,\nthat time entering the mirror world from\nthe bottom of the lake. I didn't want to\nsave you, but wanted to kill you.\" At\nthis moment, Tramax clothes were also\nabout to be stripped off. He gritted his\nteeth saying, \"What?\" She looked at\nTranmack with seductive eyes, saying,\n\"So, my character is much worse than you\nimagine. I won't turn back.\" Luong 5\nthen looked straight at Tranmack,\nsaying, \"Don't worry. I don't need you\nto take responsibility for me. I just\nhope in case there's a day. You You can\nshow mercy to the heaven calculation\nsect. You wait.\" Uh-uh. Tramax screamed.\nTula watched the scene before its eyes,\nlaughing proudly. Dense energy\nsurrounded it. it shouted in a\nhigh-pitched excited tone. I succeeded.\nThe sky was a patch of bright red. Tula\ndived down at the two on the ground with\namazing speed, surrounded by beams of\nlight. Lung Fun whispered, \"D, let me\nD.\" Her eyes were desolate, her voice\nslightly choked. \"Dad, I won't need to\nshoulder such important responsibility\nanymore.\" Tranmac saw her like this,\nself-reroachfully said, \"Little junior\nsister. Sorry, senior brother.\" Tranmack\nsuddenly seemed to remember something,\nshouting loudly, \"Little Junior sister.\nIf I die, I will never see little Junior\nsister again.\" He thought, \"Absolutely\nnot.\" Tr's whole body was full of power.\nTwo forces collided. Uh, she screamed in\npain, blasted away by Tranm. Uggh.\nTranmac was uncontrollably furious.\nLuong Five Van looked in horror at the\nscene before her. Ah, finally, only two\npeople remained. They fainted side by\nside on the grass beside a tree not far\naway. The female dog had also fainted.\nLuong five and opened her eyes feeling a\nbit dazed. Huh? This is She sat up\nrubbing her eyes. She saw two people\nwith disheveled clothes, covered her\nmouth in surprise and hurriedly put on\nher outer robe. She blushed frantically\nputting on her clothes. Luong Five Van\nsat on the ground looking at Tramac. I\nwant to take responsibility for you. He\nspoke groggly. She was startled,\npanicked, seeing the exit. This is Let\nme leave this place. She closed her eyes\nand whispered. She flew toward that\ndoor. Tranmack grabbed the female dog's\nleg, spinning it like a top. Poison me,\nright? Trax said, \"Let you poison me.\"\nThe female dog was dizzy and seeing\nstars. \"I'll kill you,\" Tranm used force\nto throw it against the cliff in front.\nThe female dog opened its mouth wide. I\nwon't forgive you, Tranmax said\ngloomily, grabbing its neck again,\nsaying in a low voice. Maybe I can't\nkill you, but I can torture you every\nday like this. Torture you until you\nvomit. The female dog was so scared that\ntears and snot ran down, urgently\nbegging for mercy. Spare me. Stop\nspinning. Tranmack shouted angrily.\nWhere is the lover's tear? Is there any\nleft and all over to me? The female dog\nanswered pitifully. I really don't have\nany left. You still lie to me. Tramac\ngot angry. I'm not lying to you. I was\nwrong. Sorry. It hurriedly explained\nextremely sincerely, sticking out its\ntongue, revealing the object inside,\nsaying, \"This is my space stone. My\nstuff is all in there. Spare me, space\nstone. This is indeed a good thing,\"\nTramac thought. He said, \"However, this\nis still not enough. I want to sign a\ngod demon contract with you. That way,\nyou won't be able to cause any more\ntrouble.\" The female dog was so scared,\nits whole body trembled. It thought,\n\"Sign a contract with him?\" Even old man\nTien Trey didn't succeed. Can I sign a\ncontract with this kid with poor talent?\nTranmack said impatiently, \"Sign or\nnot!\" The female dog struggled and\nshouted, \"Sign, sign, sign!\" The female\ndog saw Tranmack preparing to act,\nsweating cold sweat and fear. Tranmac\ngently tapped his glabella, then tapped\nthe female dog's glabella. \"I, Tramac,\"\nhe said.\nThe female dog said unwillingly, \"In the\nname of God and demon, establish a\ncontract.\" \"Truda,\nit spoke again extremely reluctantly.\"\nTramac asked back threateningly. Tula is\nwilling to honor Tranmac as master. The\nfemale dog said loudly, \"Life after life\nabsolutely never betray. Life and death\nlie within one thought of the master.\"\nThe female dog absorbed it. A stream of\nblue light wrapped around it. The female\ndog asked, \"Are you satisfied? Now I am\nyour magic pet. Can you withdraw that\ndamn fire yet?\" Tranmac not only didn't\nwithdraw it, but conversely hit it in\nthe face. Without absolute strength,\nthere's no dignity. Damn it. Who names\nit a stupid name like Dodo? The female\ndog's face turned black. Dodo, he\ncalled. Master, master. The female dog\nwagged its tail in response. Yeah, this\nis a qualified magic pet. Tranmack\npraised. Let me see what treasures you\nhave. Holding the object in hand, he was\nstunned by the scene before him. This is\nunknown how many times bigger than Luong\nFi Van space belt. Looking at these\nthings, Tramac couldn't help but\nexclaim, \"There are also quite a few\ncultivation techniques and magic\ntreasures from hell. The Yong Court and\nthe Heaven Realm, also considered not\nbad. You indeed didn't lie.\" Tramac\nlooked at the female dog and said, \"Not\nbad.\" Sure enough, there is no lover's\ntear left. The female dog said\nunhappily, \"I told you I didn't lie. How\ncould I deceive the master? You stay\nhere and shut up to repent for me. I\nhave to go out and see. Before the\nfemale dog could speak, Tranmack had\ndisappeared from the mirror world. You\ndon't stay here polluting this mirror\nworld anymore. Tranmack kicked it flying\nout with one kick. He looked at the bowl\non the ground in surprise. Lung fu five\nvan. This place is the real beginning\nfor our story. Tranmack picked it up,\nmumbling to himself. As a result, it was\nall just a misunderstanding. Tranmack\nmoved it away. Your bull, return it to\nyou. That bull fell from the sky,\nlanding in front of the female dog. With\nTranmax's voice still echoing by its\nears, the sect leader was dragged out by\ntwo guards. He shouted furiously,\n\"Correct, I am the sect leader. Let me\nin.\" But those two still didn't care\nabout him, saying, \"Just now you\nyourself said, without a token, no one\nis allowed in. Even if it's the sect\nleader, it's not allowed.\" The sect\nleader looked at them angrily, gritting\nhis teeth, saying, \"You guys.\" Seeing\nthis scene, Tran Mack, who was eating,\ncouldn't help but burst in a laughter.\nHe laughed while extending an\ninvitation. The sect leader is even\nchased out the door. \"Forget it. Come\nover here, uncle. I welcome you.\" The\nsect leader huffed. Although angry, he\nhad no other way, so he had to turn\naround and walk over. He sat down on the\nchair, pointing at the two people who\njust chased him away, saying, \"You say\nthey.\" Tranmack pointed at the delicious\ndishes on the table, saying, \"Forget it.\nEat, eat.\" He chewed voraciously. While\nteasing, \"I also didn't expect the sect\nleader of the OAC sect is actually a\nglutton, even keeping a hot pot in the\nspace key.\" The sect leader picked up a\npiece of meat, saying, \"I also didn't\nexpect you actually haven't died.\"\nTramac asked back in confusion, \"Who\nsaid I died?\" Ansu.\nThe sect leader explained to him,\n\"Tatien looked for you in the forbidden\narea several times, but didn't find\nyou.\" He continued with a serious look.\nHe felt he had harmed you to death and\nhas gone into death seclusion. We didn't\ndare tell Yian Quinn Thomas News. Having\nsaid that, the SE leader looked up to\nsee Tranm was still safe and sound, then\nexclaimed, \"However, looking at it now,\nnot only did you not die, your strength\nalso increased quite a lot.\" Tranmax\nsuddenly asked a question full of hidden\nmeaning. Why can't the OAC sect become\nthe tin lawn sect? Why can't the OAC\nsect become the heaven calculation sect?\nHearing these questions, the sect leader\nwas stunned. Even as chopsticks fell,\nthe chopsticks fell into the bowl,\nmaking a crisp sound. Tranmack\ncontinued, \"I need a powerful aid, a\nforce stronger than even the Heaven\nCalculation sect, the windb blade sect,\nor the shadow gate.\" The sect leader\nasked suspiciously. \"Then why don't you\ngo directly to find the heaven\ncalculation sect and the like?\" Tranmack\nreplied, \"Even you don't trust me. Do\nyou feel those sects with eyes higher\nthan their heads will trust me?\" Hearing\nthese words, the sect leader then asked,\n\"What is the matter? Can you tell me?\"\nTramac thought for a moment. He patted\nhis chest proudly saying, \"I am 23 years\nold this year.\" Naent soul stage. \"I'm a\nthird grade alchemist, also a third\ngrade array master, and also a third\ngrade artificer. I possess countless\ncultivation techniques. In my eyes, your\ntreasure pavilion is just trash.\" After\nhearing his confident words, the sect\nleader was horrified to the point of\ncold sweat. Unable to speak, Tranmax\nsaid firmly, \"I need to become strong\nstep by step, then become the largest\nforce in the cultivation world.\" The\nsect leaders still felt confused, so he\nhad to continue asking, \"What is the\npurpose? What is the purpose of you\ndoing these things?\" Tranmack held out\ntwo fingers in front of the sect leader\nastounded face, saying, \"You guys only\nneed to help me do two things. First,\ndestroy the Tinlon sect. Second, help me\nconfront the entire cultivation world.\nSeeming not to dare believe his ears, he\nslammed the table and stood up,\nshouting, \"Are you crazy?\" Tranmack used\na calm tone to say, \"Of course, without\ngiving, there will be no harvest. The\nhigher the risk, the return can be\ngreater. Giving nothing, having no risk,\nwhere is such a good thing?\" Finished\nspeaking, he also stood up, picking up a\npiece of meat for the sect leader. The\nsect leader felt afraid, so he hesitated\nand asked, \"But this risk is too big,\nright?\" Confronting the entire\ncultivation world, \"Isn't that seeking\ndeath?\" Tranmack pointed at his face,\nusing a steel-like voice to ask back,\n\"Your current situation. Isn't it also\nalmost dead?\" Tranmax softened his\nvoice, continuing to persuade the sect\nleader. \"Of course, I'm not forcing\neither, nor is it that I must find you\nguys for help. Oac sect or star sword\nsect, either fine.\" He slapped the\ntable, making a decision. We will help.\nTranmack picked up a piece of food, put\nit in his mouth, and said, \"It's\ndecided, then. I can help the young lady\ninside heal her injuries. Consider a\ndeposit.\" He exclaimed in great\nsurprise. \"You even know about this?\" He\nlooked at him with eyes that seemed to\nsee through everything.\" He stroked his\nchin and said, \"This isn't really a\nsecret to me.\" \"Anyway, happy\ncooperation.\" In the small courtyard\nnext to the bamboo forest, Tranax stood\nin the yard, muttering. Sure enough,\nthere's nothing a hot pot meal can't\nsolve. He recalled the meal just now. He\ninvited the two who had chased the sect\nleader out to eat hot pot. Moved to\ntears, they said, \"Inviting us for hot\npot? No problem. From now on, invite us\ninto the sect and we'll be your\nunderlings.\" Hearing this, the sect\nleader was furious and shouted, \"That\nhot pot is mine.\" Tramac went into the\nroom, summarizing what had happened.\nThis trip yielded a considerable\nharvest. Heaven rank cultivation\ntechniques, storage space, and this\nmirror. Having said that, he asked the\nlittle female dog standing on the bed.\nDoubt da tell me what exactly is this\nmirror? Tula replied, \"This is the\nrebirth mirror.\" Tramac pressed, \"What\nis the rebirth mirror used for?\" Tula\nenjoyed his petting and explained, \"It\ncomes from hell, able to see a person's\npast and present lives, but not the\nfuture.\" You ask one sentence, it\nanswers one sentence. Whatever functions\nit has, it will state clearly. It can\nalso create a clone for you. The\nincantation is two LA's voice blended\ninto the space. Outside, the sun was\nshining brightly. A pigeon flew past.\nTwo gatekeepers stood in front of the\ndoor. The short-haired one asked the\nlong-haired one, \"Big brother, where are\nwe going?\" Suddenly, the two heard a\nmovement and turned their heads to look\nback. The long-haired one replied,\n\"Don't call me Big Brother. It sounds\nlike a gangster gang. How about young\nmaster? Tramac walked out at this\nmoment. Heard him say that and\nexclaimed, \"Huh, that's very good.\"\nNotfang Duong really knows how to talk.\nTranmack walked out with them, walking\nand talking. We're going to West\nRidgtown to find a medicine shop named\nLu Hang. West RGtown. People coming and\ngoing in front of a shop. The sound of\ntwo people arguing came. Ha, not NAC.\nDon't refuse a toast only to drink a\nforfeit. We are people from the Heaven\nTreasure Pavilion. offend us and don't\neven think about doing business anymore.\nNot selling. I won't sell this ice cloud\nfairy plant no matter what. Tranmack\nwalked over, looked at the sign, and\nconfirmed. This is the place. Several\npeople walked out of the shop, blocking\nhim. Get out. Get out. What are you\ndoing? Tranmack asked in confusion. I\ncame to buy medicine. Isn't this a\nmedicine shop? The leader with a strange\nmustache said fiercely. Scram. This\nmedicine shop is closed. Not selling\nanymore. Suddenly, a voice came from\ninside the shop, startling the guy who\nsaid, \"My medicine shop is closed.\" A\nscorching flame flew out. The leader saw\nit and screamed in panic. \"Fire! Fire!\"\nThe flames clung to the bodies of the\nthree arrogant men and blazed up,\nquickly, causing them to scream\nmiserably, \"Help! I am Bernink! Put out\nthe fire!\" The people of the green\nmedicine sect bowed their heads and\ncried loudly. When we returned, we found\nthat master had been attacked by fire\npoison in his heart. Hearing this,\nTramac fell in a deep thought. Fire\npoison attacking the heart. Medicine and\nacupuncture cannot cure it. He continued\nto try hard to persuade. I beg you,\nbenefactor. You are a third great\nalchemist. You surely have a way. I,\nHan, not NAC, am willing to be a cow or\na horse for you in this life. At this\nmoment, a voice came from inside. I\nsaved your life and passed on the skill\nof alchemy to you, not for you to be a\ncow or a horse for others. Finished\nspeaking, that person hurriedly knelled\ndown. The grace of saving my life. The\ngrace of passing on the way. This\ndisciple will never forget. Precisely\nbecause of this. This disciple wants to\nsave master's life. Was being a cow or a\nhorse. Even if you want this disciple's\nlife, it's fine. Nam tongue opened his\nmouth to ask, \"Are you the benefactor\nthat not NAC often mentions?\" Saying\nthat a flower emitting a blue light\nslowly flew out. Take this water cloud\nfairy plant. Consider it. Thanks for\nsaving not NAC and Henney. Don't worry\nabout this old man. I know I'm\nincurable. Tranmack calmly said. Whether\nto save or not, let's not talk about it\nfor now. I'm a guest of yours after all.\nLeaving me standing here isn't a bit\nrude. Seeing this, the disciple implored\nhis master. Please let the benefactor\ncome in and sit. After inviting Tranmack\ninside, Nam Tong revealed his heart. I'm\nthe only remaining disciple of the green\nmedicine sect. Nam Tong. Sigh. Today,\nthe Green Medicine sect has fallen into\nsuch a state. It's shameful, Tramac\ndeclared with a determined, \"Look, I can\nsave you.\" The people of the Green\nMedicine sect heard this and replied\nhappily. I knew the benefactor would\ndefinitely have a way. Neam Tongue went\nstraight to the point. State your\nconditions. Tranmax smiled gently and\nreplied, \"I hope you guys will help me\nmake pills.\" Neam Tongue asked back in\nconfusion, \"Make pills? You yourself are\nan excellent alchemist. Why not make\nthem yourself?\" Tramax slowly explained.\nBecause what I want to refine is not one\nor two pills, but a continuous stream of\npills. I imagine it like the green\nmedicine sect back then selling pills to\nthe entire cultivation world. Nam tongue\nasked in astonishment. What did you say?\nHe slammed the table angrily. Please\nleave. I won't see you out. Seeing the\ntense atmosphere, Nam Hinn spoke up to\npersuade. Master, quell your anger. The\nbenefactor can save you. This small\nrequest is acceptable. Don't we usually\nmake pills anyway? Just making a bit\nmore. What's impossible about that? Neam\ntongue shouted. What do you understand?\nSelling pills in large quantities\ntouches the interests of the heaven\ntreasure pavilion. Why was the green\nmedicine sect wiped out back then? It\nwas precisely because of this. He\npointed at Tranmack. Are you perhaps\nsent by the Heaven Treasure Pavilion to\ncause trouble? Is that it? Want to trick\nus? Tranmack's subordinate outside spoke\nup indignantly. Old man, my young master\nhas the kindness to save you. What are\nyou saying? The person beside him added.\nThat's right, ungrateful wretch. Nam\ntongue roared. All of you get out. That\nroar carried a huge force, blasting the\npeople standing there away. Uh, fire.\nAfter shouting, fire\nlow. Master. The people of the green\nmedicine sect ran over worriedly.\nMaster. Seeing Tranmax still standing\nthere calmly, the old man was a bit\nsurprised. Your strength is not weak. No\nwonder you are so arrogant. Perhaps I\nwrongly accused you. But there is no\nnegotiation on this matter. You should\ngo. Grasping the main point, Tranmack\nsneered. You are afraid of the Heaven\nTreasure Pavilion? Tranmack asked\nsuspiciously. You are afraid of the\nHeaven Treasure Pavilion? Neam Tongue\nimmediately replied. Of course, I'm\nafraid. Who isn't afraid? The Heaven\nTreasure Pavilion's power is so great.\nNeam Tongue recalled the past in panic.\nThe heaven treasure pavilion caused me\nto be poisoned with fire, took away my\nwife, and even wanted to deceive my\ndaughter. I I seeing this, Tramax said\nconfidently, \"Trust me, I will help you\neliminate the fire poison, restore your\nstrength so you can take revenge.\"\nFacing his confidence, Nam Tong still\nhesitated. But Nam Hinn immediately\npersuaded her father. If the benefactor\nsays he can do it, then he definitely\ncan. After all, he is a good friend of\nthe heaven calculation sex chief\ndisciple Luong Fian. He opened his mouth\nto ask, \"You're a good friend of Luong\nFian.\" Tramac gave a light mm,\naffirming, \"Yes, that's right. We are\nvery close friends.\" Tramac thought to\nhimself, adapting to the situation,\n\"I'll borrow your reputation, Luong Fi\nVan, for a bit.\" Hearing him say, \"So,\nNam Tong agreed.\" All right, I actually\nwant to see how you will cure me. A blue\nflame appeared on Trram's hand. Water\nfire. He was startled. You want to\nintroduce fire into the body? Do you\nknow the danger in that? Tramac was very\ncalm, slowly guiding the blue flame into\nhis body. Don't worry, I know what to\ndo. He nervously controlled the flame\ninside the body. Sure enough, his\ninternal organs were all being burned.\nThe situation was quite serious. Then he\nslowly pulled the flame, which had\nturned red, out, guiding that flame into\nhis own body. Tranmack groaned in pain.\nBenefactor. The disciple ran over to\nsupport Tranmack. Quickly prepare a\nsecret room for me. Nam Tong said\nanxiously. Quickly, take him away. It's\nthat room inside. Two people stood guard\noutside the room. Tranmack sat in\nmeditation in the room, pondering for a\nmoment. He decided, \"This time I should\nuse this water cloud fairy plant.\"\nTranmack calmed his mind. \"What I have\nto do now is to adjust this waterfire\nimbalance.\" Nam Hinn stood aside asking\nworriedly, \"Father, do you really feel\nbetter?\" Nam Tong was busy looking for\nmedicine, replying, \"Yes, I want to\nhurry and refine a few pills for myself\nand also use them to treat that young\nman's body.\" Nam Hinn said admiringly,\n\"I didn't expect him to directly grasp\nfather's source of illness and refine it\nwithin his own body.\" \"The benefactor's\nstrength is truly amazing.\" He also\nadmitted, \"True, I'm also convinced\nnow.\" At this moment, a group of people\nwere making noise outside. Hey Nam, open\nthe door. It's one thing not to give us\nthe water cloud fairy, but you also\ninjured people. Come out here. Nam\ntongue spoke loudly from inside. The\nmedicine shop is open for people, not\nfor animals. The person outside shouted\nangrily. Who are you calling an animal?\nYou old geyser. At this moment, a\nwoman's voice rang out. Nam tongue, what\nexactly do you want? Open the door\nimmediately finished speaking. Nam Hin\nimmediately recognized that familiar\nvoice and hurriedly ran over its mom.\nNam tongue shouted to stop her. I said,\n\"Do not open the door, master.\" The\ndisciple hurriedly ran over, \"Master,\"\nalthough coughing up blood, Nam tongue\nstill tried to say, \"Don't don't open\nthe door for that woman.\" Nam Hinn was\npressing against the door at this\nmoment. \"Father,\" he still analyzed\nsoftly. \"She abandoned us father and\ndaughter long ago.\" Then he suddenly\nfell down. Nam Hinn hurriedly knelt\ndown. I know, father. I won't open the\ndoor. That person stood there. What\nhappened? Nam Hinn's mother outside was\nstill cursing loudly. Old beast only\nknowing how to cause trouble for me.\nIt's better if you die. Nam Hinn and the\ndisciples supported him with worried\nfaces. Father, master waiting for a\nwhile, seeing no movement inside, Nam\nHinn's mother ordered. Don't care about\nthis old beast anymore. Let's go. The\nman beside her warned loudly. Nam Tong,\nI tell you, if you still don't know\nwhat's good for you, wait until the\nelder comes. He will teach you a lesson.\nNam Hinn and the disciple shouted\nanxiously, \"Father, are you okay?\"\n\"Master, master, wake up.\" Tranmax stood\nbehind, having observed the situation.\nThe disciple gently placed a cup of tea\non the table, asking softly, \"Please\nhave some tea. Is your body okay?\" Trac\nreplied, \"I'm Fine. What exactly was\nthat about just now?\" Hearing this, the\ndisciple looked dejected. Sigh. Don't\nmention it. It's all ugly family\nbusiness. Tranmack asked curiously. Just\nnow I thought I heard Nam Hinn call the\nwoman outside. Mom, the disciple\nexplained. Yes, yes, she's my master's\nwife. No, she was my master's wife, but\nnow she is the mistress of a Heaven\nTreasure Pavilion elder, the\nbranchmaster of the Heaven Treasure\nPavilion in West Ridgtown. Tranmack\nlistened attentively. Seems like quite a\nstory. Before the relationship between\nthe green medicine sect and heaven\ntreasure pavilion wasn't bad. That elder\nwas even master's sworn brother. The\ndisciple continued. In the end, Master\nwas betrayed by his best friend and his\nmost beloved wife ran off with that\nfriend. Master's fire poison affliction\nis also related to her. Master has\nalways endured it. He lives for the\ngreen medicine sect lives for his\ndaughter. Hearing this, Tranmack\npondered. To have such deep hatred yet\npossess such steadfast endurance. He is\na man capable of great things. Then a\ngreen pill appeared in Tranmax's hand.\nThis is for you. If your master can turn\nhatred into motivation and continue to\nimprove himself, then when he breaks\nthrough to the deity transformation\nrealm, this pill can offer him the\ngreatest assistance. The disciple\ntimidly reached out to take the glowing\npill. This is a pill. He looked at\nTranmack in astonishment. This is the\nmost precious among fourth grade pills.\nAny faction would want to obtain it.\nThis? Do you really want to give it to\nus? Tramac replied, I said, I'm giving\nit to you, so I absolutely won't take it\nback. The disciple looked at the pill,\nthinking to himself, with this pill, it\nmeans master has the potential to become\na top tier cultivator. Seeing Tranm\npreparing to leave, the disciple spoke\nup, \"Benefactor, who exactly are you?\"\nTrust replied gently. \"All right, let\nyour master rest first. I'm going.\" A\ngroup of people were gathered around a\ndining table, taking turns standing up\nto offer toasts. Dev, congratul\nto the naent soul realm this time.\nYou're the number one person in our OAC\nsect. Congratul\nsect elder replied humbly. It's nothing.\nIt's nothing. Elder Vu is truly\nformidable. The OAC sect leader smiled\nand introduced. That's right. This is\nTranmack. He previously refined a third\ngrade clear sky pill possessing superb\nskills. He is now the youngest elder of\nour sect. Everyone raised their wine\nbowls high, toasting Tran Mack in unison\nto our new elder. Tranmack replied,\n\"Thank you. Thank you, everyone. Eat and\ndrink your fill.\" A moment later, Tran\nMack walked out. \"Sigh. I'm really not\nused to this.\" He thought to himself,\n\"Instead of spending time drinking this\nwine, I might as well continue refining\nmy fire pattern saber.\" He noticed a\nfigure outside. Huh? Why is there\nsomeone sneaking out from the banquet?\nAfter seeing the person's face clearly,\nTran Mack was even more surprised. Elder\nVu. Tran Mack gently approached, taking\nthe old man's wine gourd. Elder Vu,\ntoday is your big day. Why did you run\nover here to drink alone? Seeing Tran\nMack casually drinking the wine, the old\nman said angrily. You brat, just stick\nto refining your pills properly, \"Why\nmeddle in my business?\" Tranmack smiled\ngently and replied, \"If you don't mind,\ntell me a bit about it.\" The old man\nangrily snatched back the wine gourd.\n\"Kid minding other people's business?\"\nHe spoke frankly. I don't mind telling\nyou. The reason I could advance to the\nnaent soul realm this time is entirely\nbecause that day I heard a specific\nsound of a hammer. Tranmack asked in\nconfusion. Hammer sound. The old man\nrecalled the past. It was not long ago.\nRight in this artifact refining room. I\ndon't know who was inside hammering for\ntwo whole months. Within that sound of\nforging iron, there seemed to be hidden\na principle of heaven and earth. Only\nafter listening to it could I break\nthrough the bottleneck of many years and\nreach the nent soul realm. He looked at\nhis hands in confusion, but I don't know\nwhy. The current me doesn't dare to hold\na hammer anymore. The old man asked\nTranmack blankly. I'm clearly a third\ngrade artifacer. Yet now I dare not use\na hammer. Do you know what that feeling\nis like? Tranmack reassured him. Calm\ndown a bit. He composed himself,\nthinking to himself. The person forging\niron for 2 months a while back. Wasn't\nthat me? the old man explained. That's\nwhy I wanted to come here for a walk to\nsee if I could meet that expert again\nand ask for some pointers. Tramac found\nit very amusing upon hearing this. This\nold man is quite cute to be able to\nachieve enlightenment just by listening\nto my hammer sounds. He's no ordinary\nperson either. I might as well give him\na hand. He boldly made a suggestion.\nJust waiting like this isn't a solution.\nI think you should try your hand with\nfirst grade materials first. Even if you\nruin them, it won't be heartbreaking.\nBut the old man felt it wasn't right.\nFirst grade materials aren't cheap\neither. It's a pity to ruin them. He\ndidn't give up suggesting then use\nordinary materials. But he was still\ndissatisfied. I'm a dignified third\ngrade artificer. Using ordinary\nmaterials is beneath my station. Trax\ngaze became serious saying, \"But right\nnow you're just starting over. You must\nact first. Then you can see what you can\nrefine. If you keep delaying, the state\nfrom your recent breakthrough will be\nconsumed until almost nothing is left.\nHearing this, he suddenly came to a\nrealization. You are very right. I need\nto start now. Finished speaking, he\nimmediately ran off. Kid, thank you.\nTranmack looked at the old man's\nretreating figure, his gaze sharp as if\nin thought. Then he took out a mirror.\nAll right, let me find some materials to\nupgrade the fire pattern saber in here.\nThe old man began to refine the\nartifact. He swung the heavy hammer\nprecisely, sweating profusely, but was\nstill dissatisfied. No, still not right.\nHe lost his composure, lost confidence\nin himself. I can feel my own spiritual\nenergy is in chaos. Now I can't even\nrefine ordinary materials properly. I am\na disgrace to my sect. Just as the old\nman felt helpless, suddenly a familiar\nsound of hammering came through. That\nsound was rich in rhythm, seeming to\nurge him on. He calmed down, recalling,\n\"It's this sound. The one that\nenlightened me before was this sound.\" A\npowerful voice rang out. \"What are you\nwaiting for? Pick up the hammer.\" He\nimmediately grabbed the hammer and\ncontinued working. \"Yes, yes, I feel it\nright now.\" He seemed to have found new\npassion, rapturously pounding the hammer\ndown onto the red hot steel billet."
