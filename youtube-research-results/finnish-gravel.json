      "description": "The first edition of FNLD GRVL is officially in the books, and what a weekend it was. From shakeout rides with Valtteri Bottas and Tiffany Cromwell, to rides with Castelli, Canyon, Strava and Zipp, to a non-traditional pro panel featuring some of the biggest names in cycling we packed a ton into three days; and, that was all before we even rolled up to the starting line. On Saturday, June 10th nearly 1,000 gravel cyclists from around the world lined up in downtown Lahti, Finland, and we sent them off into the countryside and along three distances (177k, 77k, and 40k) through the pristine gravel roads of Finnish Lakeland. That night we brought it all to a close in typical GRVL fashion under the midnight sun in the Lahti harbor with awards, concert, DJ, and and afterparty complete with sauna and hot tubs. Catch our full day-by-day recap right here, and keep your eye out for 2024 registration dates and info. \n\n\n\n#gravelrace #gravelcycling #valtteribottas #finland #visitfinland #lahti",
