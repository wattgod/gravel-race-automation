      "description": "The last outdoor race of the season \n\nAs mentioned after my Worlds movie I got sick the day after.\nInstead of working towards this last race it was working to get healthy again.\nIt was a late call, even had my doubts the morning itself if it was a good idea to go.\nBut I\u2019m not made of glass, so I took all my courage and got into the car.\n\nI started well, much better than expected, I managed to stay top-5 for a long time, even top-3 for a while until, due to slower riders, I lost the wheel of my compatriot. I came riding solo in 8th position but I often used slower riders to hide from the wind in the open spaces not needlessly spending all my energy.\n\nIn the last lap we were only 4 fighting for places 8 to 11, until I got dropped on the last hill of the day. I went in TT mode after but wasn\u2019t able to catch on again.\n\nEnded this year with an unexpected 11th place and qualification for Worlds Gravel 2026.",
