forward to it and\nhopefully i'll see some people that i\nrecognize up there\nand\nwhat's really cool about this race is\nthey really wanted to encourage more\nwomen to\nregister so they were holding more spots\nfor women and giving them a little bit\nof a discount i think i'm not too sure\nso this bike jersey i'm wearing is\nreally really special to me\nit was the one of the original\njerseys for the aerosmith mountain bike\nclub\nthat was made probably i don't know it's\nprobably super old now it's probably\nlike 10 years old\ni don't know i had such good times with\nthe bike club back then going on group\nrides and we used to do lots of\ndifferent events it was a really special\ntime to me for a really special time for\nme\nanyways i was devastated because\nsomebody actually stole my aerosmith\nbike club jersey when we were on a bike\ntrip\na few years ago and they actually stole\na bunch of bikes too and all my gear\nwas you know it's really bad scene but\nanyways\ni was devastated about losing my classic\naerosmith bike club jersey\nand then what was really cool was a few\nyears later my friend jackie she gifted\nit\nshe gifted her jersey to me on my\nbirthday and

      "description": "'Repurposed' From perfect gravel roads to gravel hotels, bike festivals, stacked local groups rides and everything in between, from Chris Hatton's perspective, British Columbia is a mecca for gravel, and it deserves some level of recognition for the amazing things happening here. \n\nFor gravel riders, we\u2019re able to use these roads for adventure and exploration, linking together single-day routes and bikepacking trips alike, leading to some pretty epic days out. \n\nWith gravel being just one of the ways that this infrastructure is being used for something other than forestry, this seems to be creating another layer of value for this network that wasn\u2019t there before, and there seems to be something profound about that. We\u2019re able to access these wild places on bikes because of this extensive forest road network, and that\u2019s partially why BC is such a unique place for this kind of riding. \n\n//\nStoryteller\nChris Hatton www.instagram.com/chrisrjhatton\n\n//\nProject Partners\nTeravail https://teravail.com\nWe Are One Composites www.weareonecomposites.com\n7Mesh https://7mesh.com/\n\n//\nFilm & Production\nPierre-Luc Arseneau www.instagram.com/plarseneau",
