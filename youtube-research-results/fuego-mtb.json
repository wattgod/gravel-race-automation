      "description": "2025 Sea Otter Classic Fuego XL\nSince the early '90's I've known of the Sea Otter Classic MTB event in Monterey, California... and last year decided it was time to check it out for myself.\nHere is my \"Fuego XL\" full run (basically all the footage I recorded) It is a tough event, tougher than I expected. While we had great weather - not too hot, sunny - a bit of wind which you really felt in your face as the day progressed, but the climbs are long.\nThis video is to hopefully show as much of the course as possible so if you're considering entering (and I suggest you do!) hopefully this gives you a good idea of the terrain and event overall!\nHopefully I'll have a shortened version done shortly!\n\nIf you get the chance - go! It was a great event, great people, (invited to \"somewhere\" every evening by \"bikers\" MTB, Gravel and Gravity - everyone there for a great time)\nI got to meet / watch world bike celebs and just have a great time throughout!\n\nIf you wish to help support this channel please visit:  patreon.com/AdventureAL55\nI plan to enter at least 1 major event each year, as well as take on the local MTB and Cross races.\n2025 Goal (Here it is) Sea Otter Classic - Enduro and Fuego XL (Laguna Raceway, California) - DONE\nNext... Volcanic MTB, New Zealand. Trans Rockies Singletrack 6, BC, Canada",

      "transcript": "hey guys Carrie Werner checking in after\nsea otter classic which was also the\nfirst round of the lifetime Grand Prix\nseries I just thought it'd be cool to\nwalk you through my race\n[Music]\nso sea otter classic is a big vendor\nExpo basically all the brands are there\nincluding me with bike flights so we\nshowed up on Monday set up on Tuesday I\ngot out on course with Russell and Alexi\non Wednesday and then I was working the\nExpo all day Thursday and Friday not an\nexcuse just uh just walking you through\nthe week so yeah just like talking about\nbike flights to people walking around\nhanding out swag doing all that the race\nkicked off first thing on Saturday\nmorning at 9 00 a.m and it was a stacked\nfield not that this is any surprise the\nlifetime series is an application entry\nprocess so whoever vetted the\napplications for the entries like\nyou had to be bringing some Firepower to\nmake it in to this series that or just\nhave a huge Instagram following or\nwhatever not real sure what the criteria\nexactly was first round the the course\nitself was roughly 34 mile loop on\nreally fast kind of single track dirt\nroad there wasn't a lot of technical\nsections out there there was a couple\nrocks here and there but for the most\npart it was really fast and kind of\nloose over hard pack on all the single\ntrack and then there was a bunch of Fire\nRoad sections so when we did the\npre-ride lap on Wednesday it was like a\ntwo and a half hour lap for race time\nthat was roughly cut in half so it was\nit was cooking the pace and right off\nthe line that was the case my power\nmeter kind of quit out on me so I don't\nhave data to reference for you guys\nbut Russell finsterwald posted on\nInstagram a couple data points that\nfirst two minutes off the start was two\nminutes at 600 watts probably a little\nless for me\nsince I got swarmed there in that corner\nbut yeah that was the name of the game\nhaving a good start and kind of settling\ninto position I basically settled in\nright at right in that like 15th spot or\nso and then kind of tried to do my best\nto work up early and I knew once we\ncrested that first major climb it was\ngoing to be basically the groups were\nkind of set on that Gravel Road until uh\nthe rest of the course kind of dictated\nwhere groups were going to come together\napart I found myself in a good group of\nlike five or six guys by about halfway\nthrough it was myself Kyle Trudeau\nLachlan Morton Alex Howells and Lance\nhadette we ended up catching up to\nBraden Lang as well and then he rolled\nthrough the start finish with us we were\nkind of cruising there from about\nhalfway through the lap until I mean all\nthe way through the\nthe start finish starting lap two\nlike I said the pace was hot we could\nsee the chase group kind of up the road\njust like maybe a minute up I think it\nwas 30 seconds at that halfway Aid and\nby the time we came across the line\nheading into the second lap it was\nroughly a minute as we entered that\nsecond lap we grabbed a bottle there\nright on the Raceway and then kind of\ngot ready for those first Punchy climbs\nagain and right there is where our group\nsplit up uh right on that first bit of\nsingle track so it was Braden Kyle\nTrudeau and myself kind of going over\nthe top of that first climb together we\ncould smell blood in the water as guys\nwere kind of starting to fade back the\nfirst of which was Tobin uh we ended up\ncatching him right there after the\ngravel on the first bit of single track\nand then it was it was Kyle Tobin Braden\nand I\non that first bit and that's kind of\nwhere we lost contact with the rest of\nthe dudes by the time we came through\nthe feed zone for the second time the\nhalfway feed uh it was just the three of\nus we got onto the gravel road and kind\nof started trading pools eventually we\nended up shedding Kyle from the group\nand then it was Braden Tobin and me and\nthis was in this in this the race for\n13th Place as we got through the lap and\ninto that kind of last like 45 minutes\nof the laugh we started catching a\ncouple guys that had started coming\nbackwards from that chase group uh this\nuh Canyon Rider and then Ryan Standish\ncame backwards thing about these races\nare like you gotta be on it and like\nreally try not to blow up because if you\ncan finish hard you can usually get a\ncouple spots in the end of the race I\nwas really nervous about this because\ncoming into that last bit of the race I\nwas starting to feel twinges of cramping\nand I still had that massive finish\nclimbed so I got popped from this group\nwith Tobin Braden and another guy that\nwe ended up catching and so I basically\nhad a 30 minute time trial 25 minute\ntime trial from that point to the end\nwhere I was constantly looking back I\nknew Ryan was back there Taylor ladine\nwas chasing really hard unfortunately I\ndon't have any footage of this I was\nin a fight for my life it felt like out\nthere\nthe last thing I was thinking about in\nthose final 30 minutes of the race was\nhitting my record button plus I was\nalone so there wouldn't have been much\nto see but honestly the excuse for me\nwas just lack of energy and focus I was\njust gripped and just man I just wanted\nto get to the finish so I ended up\nholding Chasers Off Taylor ladin caught\nup to me just as we entered the Raceway\nbut I had a big enough gap on him that I\nwas able to come across the line in 13th\nwhich I was happy about a good start to\nthe season\nand once you take the non-lifetime\nseries Racers out I slot in at 10th in\nthe series so you know good stepping\nstone heading into the rest of the\nseason by no means am I content with\nthat six more races in the series all\nthe way through October so a lot of time\nfor a lot of different stuff to happen\nUnbound is the next one about a month\nand a half right that first weekend of\nJune and as everybody knows that is a\nflat Fest and it's 200 miles it's a nine\nand a half hour race so\num yeah all those guys that maybe were\nat the back of the pack struggling with\nthe technical sections on the single\ntrack or you know aren't as good\ntechnically are gonna bring all of that\nhunger and motivation to Unbound so it's\ngonna be you know even more competitive\nso that was my race uh thanks for\nwatching the race recap\num leave any questions or comments below\nand I'll see you guys at the next one\nwhich will be lifetime Grand Prix round\ntwo Unbound gravel"

have\ngone down as well as a preview of a few\nchanges you can expect to see this\nseason\nhere we are the third season of the\nlifetime Grand\nPrix seasons 1 and two really exceeded\nall our\nexpectations in terms of athletic\nperformance\nfor international interest Savage\nabsolutely Savage and the participation\nfrom all the everyday athletes it's a\nsea of lra here this morning in town you\nknow I think we're going to have a even\nmore competitive Series this year you\nknow both on the men's and women's side\nI think it's going to be I think it's\ngoing to be really interesting really\nDynamic if you thought seasons 1 and two\nwere exciting well I can tell you now\nthat you haven't seen anything yet\nseason 3 is here and we can't wait to\nkick this thing off with seasons 1 and\ntwo of call of a lifetime I think we\naccomplished everything we we ever could\nhave dreamed of\naccomplishing and I'd like to see us\nfigure out a way create even more\nconnectivity to these events and these\nathletes I'm Michelle Duffy Smith\noversee the marketing across the country\nfor Lifetime events this year for the\nlifetime Grand Prix we are doubling down\non our commitment to bring the home\naudience into the action all seven races\nwill be available to watch online within\n48 Hours of the event with extended\nhighlights and stories from the athletes\nwe want the viewer to feel like they are\nalong for the ride all season long and\nin addition to ramping up our live\ncoverage we've made a couple other\nchanges as\nwell for the first time our Elite men\nand Elite women's Fields will have\nseparate starts in all seven\nraces we've also increased the prize\npurse to a grand total of\n$300,000 so buckle up because season 3\nis here and we can't wait to see how the\nnext 6 months\n[Applause]\nunfold all right we're back at the\nLaguna sea Raceway and just about 15\nminutes out from the start of the race\nyou know the competition has been fierce\nin the first two seasons and there's a\nlot on the line for these athletes these\nraces and the coverage they receive\nprovides them with the kind of exposure\nthat can really give their careers a\nboost obviously there's a few names we\nexpect to see at the pointy end of the\nrace all season long but then there's\nthe rest of the field guys and girls who\nmaybe you're not as familiar with\neverybody has their own goals going into\nthis thing what is at stake how do you\ndeal with with the pressure we took a\nlittle time the last few days to catch\nup with some of these Riders and get\nsome of their thoughts as they embark on\na new season of the lifetime Grand\nPrix I'm Samar Shepard from New Zealand\num I'm so excited to be here racing the\nlifetime Grand Prix Series has\ndefinitely drawn a bit more more eyes to\nthe sport in the US which is super cool\nso I think it's you know getting used to\nlike you know being in the lineline a\nlittle bit more it's been so much hype\nabout it the last couple of years um the\ncoverage has been amazing and every\npodcast is talking about it I'm feeling\nas good as I felt in you know any of the\nthree years for sure the Imposter\nSyndrome has definitely been present\njust because last season I didn't ride\nwell if you just look at results and\nhave all the good training numbers all\nthe good training hours blah blah blah\nbut it doesn't matter unless you do it\non race day there's a quite a few women\nthat have you know freshly off of Cape\nepic and it's like I don't have that\nkind of\nFitness but I also know I'm so capable\nof more so it's been so special for the\nGrand Prix to believe in me and let me\nhave another chance at succeeding and\nthen on the other hand like I want a\nrace to to\nwin back again and uh really cool to be\nhere and see for sure something new and\nit's on the mountain bike Which is my\nkind of my true of I mean this race\nmeans a lot to me you know I've had had\na bunch of success here when I was\nyounger had a few dark dark races here\nwhere I kind of struggle to find the you\nknow find the Rhythm and find the power\nand the speed it's so competitive like\nI'm a drop bar you know climbing\nspecialist like even on this course on\nmy best day maybe I'll get 10th 15th I\nneed to remember to like make my heart\npump harder for those couple extra\nmoments and keep that contact with that\nwheel because it always lets up and then\nyou're there and I just don't want to\nmiss being\nthere more\nwins season 3 it's what I'm going\nfor all right everybody we know how we\ngot here we know what's at stake and we\nare just a moment away from the start\nin addition to our production crew stage\nall over the course we have Kimo Seymour\nand Janelle spilker up in the heli\nthey'll be our eyes in the sky today\nkeeping us informed on all the\nhappenings out there how do I become top\n10 in that save it save\nit don't go Ro save it we also have Tim\nJohnson and Lauren Hall following the\naction on ebikes and giving us updates\nfrom the ground\nso without further Ado let's get down to\nthe start line where our men are ready\nto get this thing going K and Janelle\ntake it away we are 30 seconds from the\nstart of the lifetime cran prie\npresented by Mazda the Fuego XL we want\nto wish all the Riders the best of luck\nout there Riders go you are underway the\nlifetime Grand Prix presented by Maza\nofficially underway and they're are\nan aggressive start just as we were\ntalking about you can see Lin Morton on\nthe right hand side and the pink colors\nof EF education Alexi veran also taking\nthe start uh kind of leading the way we\nsee Keegan there off just off about\nthird or fourth wheel back on the left\nhand side I need to channel aggression\nbe completely ready to explode as soon\nas the gun goes off and be battling for\nposition right into that first single\ntrack section we're going to see as they\nmake this next turn it's going to get a\nlittle steeper and you'll see them drop\nthe hammer there this is incredibly\nspread out there using every inch of\nroad because it is a fullon fight to get\nto the front heading into this hair pin\nhere you'll see them quickly come down\nto a choke point to me if you further\nthan 10th wheel it's it's not a good\nspot to be so main focus there don't get\nbox and sharpen the elbows a little bit\ngets to that pinch point just make sure\nyou top 10 would you know it Keegan's\ngoing to lead him into the turn it's\nkind of amazing we were watching Keegan\nsitting fourth fifth wheel and it's just\na couple of pedal Strokes puts him in\nfront of the entire field Keegan is\ngoing to be leading from the start will\nhe be leading at the end so the men have\nmade it out of the Laguna sea Raceway\nand established their pecking order in\nthe single track as always we'll\ncontinue to share our updates from the\ncourse as they hit the timing mats as\nwell as any live reports we received\nfrom our crew in the\nfield but now it's time to go back to\nthe start line and let the women duke it\nout for that oh so important positioning\nas they enter the single track Kemo and\nJanelle how's it looking from the sky\nthe big names on the start line this\nyear have already been called up we've\ngot Sophia Gomez visha F Alexis starda\nHaley Smith and Lauren de Kenzo a woman\nwho has taken to the start of the season\nwith multiple\nwins the sea otter start line is one of\nthe most stressful star lines of the\nseason because even though it's still a\npretty long race SE start to make a\nlittle bit of noise Riders go you are\nunder way a lot of it's decided in the\nfirst 3 minutes on the track and the\nwomen are off chemo just like we saw in\nthe men's race the women are full gas\nall across the\nroad galexis scarta up on the right hand\nside wasting no time to take the\nlead our Elite women's event officially\noff the line and we are rolling 68 miles\nbeginning right\nnow good to see the yellow and green\njersey there I think that's that's Peta\nMullen she's come over from Australia\nmulti-time national champion in I think\nthree disciplines so hia Gomez be our\nwinner of the Grand Prix last year\nwinner here last year in a time of 4\nhours and 55 minutes taking off the\nfront of the woman's pelaton going into\nthis right-and hairpin turn Kimo she has\na significant gap on the group with that\nattack and just like that the 2024\nlifetime Grand Prix presented by Mazda\nis underway you saw our lead men and\nwomen head into the Sandy climbs and\nflowy single track of the fort or\nNational Monument they'll continue to\nride for roughly 35 miles before we see\nthem again right here as they complete\nthe first of two laps for a closer look\nat the Fuego XL course we caught up with\nlongtime race director Jeff\nFrost Jeff knows this course and this\nrace better than anyone here's Jeff with\na deeper dive into the sea otter classic\nFuego XL and what what makes this race\ndifferent from any of the other stops on\nthe lifetime Grand\nPrix my name is Jeff Frost I'm the race\ndirector for the lifetime seot classic\nin Monterey\nCalifornia I've been designing and uh\nmaintaining building laying out courses\nfor 25 plus\nyears the sea otter classic Fuego XL I\nbegins and ends at the Laguna sea\nrace consists of two laps roughly 35\nmiles each set amongst the picturesque\nFort or National\nMonument the beginning of the race is a\nSprint around the Raceway that\nimmediately funnels into single track\neveryone wants to be first out of the\nRaceway because once you hit the single\ntrack you're pretty much locked into\nyour position until the course opens\nback\nup that happens after about 5 miles when\nthe course turns onto Gravel Road here\nyou'll see riders that didn't get that\nfront position try to make up some\nground from there it's a mix of Fire\nRoad old army roads dirt and gravel and\nsingle\ntrack the climbs are short and Punchy\nand the descents are\nfast we have timing mats set up at Miles\n13 and 16 then there's three miles of\ngravel road 2 miles of single track and\nit just keeps going like this\nback and\nforth and then after about 30 miles of\nthis the Riders turn on to Lookout Ridge\nRoad one of the most iconic sections of\nthe\ncourse it's a steep climb to the top and\nthen a fast descent back into Laguna sea\nfor either the completion of lap one or\nthe Finish to the\nrace April is beautiful here in Monteray\nand we're hoping for clear skies and\nrelatively cool temps for the world's\nlargest cycling f Festival the sea otter\nclassic okay thank you Jeff we have word\nfrom out on the course that our men are\nabout 8 km in there's a bit of a climb\nin the single track before they turn\nonto our first stretch of\ngravel Kimo and Janelle how's it looking\nout\nthere yes Bill we have our eyes on the\nleading men and you're right Keegan\nSwenson is still leading the pace yeah\nwe have Keegan in front Lance that is\nbehind him Alexi Braden Lang Cole and\nthere's Matt beers moving up in position\nyou know Janelle Matt beers came into\nthis race and he really uh he just came\noff winning Cape epic and uh I think he\ncomes in with some serious confidence he\nraced with Howie they both won and uh\npretty commanding fashion they looked\ngreat beers looks great this is a good\nway for him to put some points on the\nboard early this this\nseason I do like to be in control of the\nrace\nbecause then I'm not relying on how\nother people ride I'm a bit more of a\nsteady\nRider and we've got a rider who is not\ncontent to be sitting behind the riders\nthat he is taking that little side trail\nto the right they're coming into a\ndownhill section Teo and the fewer\npeople you have in front of you the less\nlikely that you're going to have\nsomething go wrong\nyou never quite know how people are\ngoing to be in a moment like if a single\ntrack like are they going to be focused\nare they going to make mistakes here\nthey go once they hit this gravel\nsection up here the speed is going to\npick up and they're really going to\nstart moving it's rather better for you\nto have the control I can see our ebike\nreporter down there Tim Johnson it looks\nlike he is in position to join the lead\nmen on this turn\nyeah here we go I'm chasing our lead men\non this section of\ngravel this is going to start moving\npretty fast here of course conditions\nare dry which as you know means the dirt\nsections can get\nslippery we'll see how the men handle\nthose conditions once we leave the\ngravel up here and get back on single\ntrack so Janelle Matt beers has come to\nthe front he's he's not content to sit\nin and just watch this race happen he\nwants to go up and make it happen looks\nlike Alexi might have gotten on his\nwheel Keegan Keegan sitting in third\nCole in fourth right now behind our\nleading 12 we've gotten 10 more Riders\nchasing on okay right up here this is\nwhere we're going to make a right hand\nturn back onto single track you know\nJanelle Keegan is just such a crafty\nRider you know he let Matt beers come to\nthe front pull him on that rolling\ndownhill and then what does he do right\nbefore the single track he jumps back to\nthe front he is just always so spot-on\nwith his tactics\nMo this course is notoriously dry rded\nfrom all the winter rains that\nCalifornia has seen so far this year and\nthen we'll often see a lot of loose dirt\non top that will act like ball bearing\nthese guys have to be careful they've\nbeen out on the course they've seen\nwhere there's dangerous spots where\nthere's been a lot of erosion but uh boy\nthey've got to be on their on their aame\ncuz it can get uh really dicey quick\nmother this stupid\nsport word from out on the course is\nthat it is dry and Dusty and the Riders\nare having to manage those conditions\nsome with more success than others and\nas the men are moving right along\nthrough Fort or Kimo and Janelle are\ngoing to split off and go catch up with\nwomen last we saw Sophia was off to a\nhot start Kemo and Janelle how are\nthings looking now yeah looks like we're\nseeing the same thing Bill Sophia Gomez\nhas a massive gap on five Chasers we saw\nHannah AO beating that chase and it\nlooked like Katarina Nash with Alexis\nscarta a part of that five woman chase\nthis is a 5our race for the women and so\nif you go out too hard you can really\nsuffer in lap two I don't think that\nthat is on Sophia's mind at all today as\nshe has taken the lead from turn one and\nclearly is not waiting around for the\ncompetition when you see someone take a\nflyer off the front you you know you\nhave to close the gap and close the gap\nfast you need to work with the Riders\naround you but the question is will it\nbecome too competitive within that pack\nto never quite make that jump it's like\ntrying to be a conductor with an\norchestra of different people with\ndifferent natural rhythms like you have\nto figure out how to get somebody who's\nslow and steady to stay on with somebody\nwho's Punchy or somebody who's Punchy to\nkind of keep it steady I just heard from\nLauren Hall who's with the bead women\nlet's check in with her to see what\nshe's been seeing on the ground I feel\nlike we' barely begun the day and Sophia\nvishaan is gone miles gone she has just\nleft everybody else to chase uh no\nconversation right I mean it is a\nblistering Pace right now so we'll see\nif this uh is going to say for the day\nthanks for that Lauren K what do you\nthink the likelihood is that Sophia went\nout a little bit too fast today and that\nshe's going to be reeled in by this\nChase group of strong five women you\nknow knowing her uh her her results thus\nfar this year I'd say the likelihood is\npretty low but we have some very\nexperienced riders in this Chase group\nof five that is Hannah aotto leading the\ngroup you have Alexis scarta on her\nwheel and it looks like Jenna rinhart\nwho has had a very strong start to the\nseason last year I faded in the last\nfive miles and lost a couple spots and\nthat was kind of my theme last year with\nmaybe not getting my nutrition perfect\nand fading a lot so I just want to have\na clean race has some strong\nperformances under her belt but you can\ntell talking to her that she is really\nhungry for a top finish in the lifetime\nGrand Prix presented by Mazda okay thank\nyou Kemo and Janelle so as our women are\nout there jockeying for position it\nwon't be much longer before our men are\nnearing the end of lap one which if\nyou've seen the Elite field race as SE\notter before you know there's one\nsection of this course that really can\nseparate the tenders from The Pretenders\nwe mentioned it earlier it is of course\nLookout Ridge for more on the iconic\nclimb here's Michelle Duffy with a\nbreakdown on this pivotal section of the\nFuego\nXL this course is very different than\nthe rad it's very different than Unbound\nthis is going to be fast aggressive\nracing constant climbing descents blind\nturns and no part is more consequential\nthan the final climb on Lookout\nRidge it's about 2 1/2 M and 800 ft of\nelevation gain at 15%\ngrades water runoff has carved deep\ntrenches into the Sandy surface making\nit so Riders will be single file at\ntimes as they navigate their way around\nthose\nruts there are spectators up there\npeople banging on drums and the views\nare insane it's the perfect place to\nmake an attack and a fitting finale to\nrace last year it was a lead group of\nKeegan swensson Russell finsterwald\nChristopher bevens and Cole Patton at\nthe bottom of the\nclimb Keegan made his attack and Russell\nwas the only one that could\nfollow it came down to a Sprint finish\nwith Keegan narrowly beating out Russell\nto claim the top\nspot it would Mark Keegan's second quo\nXL victory in a row after separating on\nLookout and coming in Solo in 2022\non the women's side last year it was\nSophia Gomez vishaan Alexis scarta Vera\nlucer and Haley Smith at the bottom of\nthe climb as soon as they started the\nascent Sophia hit the gas and was gone\nclearly she was\ndetermined if you remember two years ago\nSophia was in the lead group on Lookout\nwith Alexis scarta and the late Mo\nWilson that year it was Mo who found the\nextra gear and left Sophia behind\nso last year I don't think anyone was\nsurprised to see Sophia perform the way\nshe did she'd lost the race on Lookout\nonce before and there was no way she was\ngoing to let it happen\nagain so this year will Sophia and\nKeegan make a successful attack on\nLookout once\nagain or will we see another Contender\nemerge from the field to take the top\nspot here in\nmontere all eyes will be on Lookout\nRidge for that second lap to find out\nall right thank you Michelle I believe\nthe men are only moments away from\nLookout and Kimo and Janelle are in\nposition and ready to walk us through\nthe action but before we cut away we\njust wanted to take a moment and\nacknowledge the upcoming 2-year\nanniversary of Mo Wilson's passing you\njust saw her there in the footage when\nshe was the 2022 SE otter classic Fuego\nXL Champion it was an amazing ride and\nby all accounts she was an amazing\nperson so today if you would like to\nhonor the memory of Mo you can check out\nthe Mariah Wilson Foundation at Mariah\nWilson foundation.org\nthe foundation aims to promote healthy\nliving and community building by\nsupporting organizations dedicated to\nexpanding access to Recreation Sports\nand educational programs and coming up\nhere in a few weeks on May 11th the\nfoundation will host the second Annual\nRide for Mo fundraiser at The Wildflower\nInn in East Berke Vermont if you're in\nthe area come out to support the Mariah\nWilson Foundation with a couple gravel\nrides live music games and an amazing\nraffle and honor Mo by embracing a\ndifficult day with love that overcomes\nhate joy that overcomes grief and life\nthat overcomes\ndeath and with that we turn to you Kimo\nand Janelle for a look at the 2024\nFields first of two climbs up Lookout\nRidge the men have hit Lookout Ridge\njust under four miles to the Finish Line\nwe've got about 10 riders in this front\ngroup we've seen two Riders kind of\ndangling off the back but now there is\nabsolutely no place to hide both in\nterms of Fitness or in terms of visual\nI think they've maybe called a little\nbit of a truce nobody's really put the\nhammer down yet on this climb they know\nit's a long climb they also know they've\ngot to do this whole Loop one more\ntime hean on the front with Alexi ver\nMullan it's exciting to see Alexi off to\nsuch a strong start you know seat was\none of his throwaway races last\nyear at this point in the race in\nprevious years we've also seen much\nsmall groups and we have a dozen men in\nthis leading group and I think that this\nis just a testament to how much the\nGrand Prix is driving Riders to train\nthrough the winter and come into the\nseason ready for a\nfight Janelle this section of Lookout\nRidge Peaks out at about uh 10\n12% there was a lot of wash out with the\nrain this year but look at Alexi going\nto the front and uh driving the pace\nhere on this hill\nstarting to break the group apart the\nfirst one to get popped off the back\nhere looks like looks to be\npacing a couple of those those gaps that\nwere opening up I think is indicative of\nwhat we'll see when they come through\nthe first of the big climbs on lap two\nthey want to start the year strong you\nknow they they much rather put some\npoints on the board early in the year\nand uh give themselves a little bit of\ncushion it's really tough to uh to\ncompete in the in the lifetime Grand\nPrix for the full season if you don't\nstart out with with a result early\non they've got another short little\nclimb it's going to lead you know lead\nthem back into some single track they'll\ncross the track and then they'll drop\ndown just next to the cork screw out\nhere at WeatherTech Laguna sea\nRaceway this is that section of course\nthat we added from last year a lot of it\nis not really well groomed single track\nand it because of all the erosion the\nrange it can be really slick it's a\nquick descent and this is not the time\nto take risks this is not where the race\nis won but it certainly can be\nlost so as they're uh dumping onto the\ntrack here and going to head through the\nthe start finish and start the second\nlap how are they looking down there\nBill looks like we've got about 10 or 11\nriders coming through right now in that\nmen's lead group we saw Keegan Swenson\nup there in second wheel as they come\nthrough those Riders all single file\nlooking like a uh road\nbreakway with that let's turn our\nattention back to Lookout as the women\nhave now made the turn and are\napproaching the climb Kimo and Janelle\nhow's that lead group looking now as\nthey approach the end of lap\none just as they have dumped out on the\nbottom of Lookout Ridge we can see\nAlexis has closed that\nGap looks to be about 3 4 seconds down\non Sophia who's got two guys I think\njust been sitting on her wheel here for\na\nwhile always amazing to me how much\nSophia wants to control the race\nCas group it is a different story alarm\nbells are still going off this is an\nexcellent time for these women to be\nable to close down some time to our\nleading\nto so Janelle we're watching Alexis and\nSophia they're hitting the steepest part\nof this climb Peaks out at about 12%\nsuper loose and Sandy we saw the guys\ncome through earlier and the guys seem\nto kind of uh call a truce coming up\nthis hill we saw Pac come off the back a\nlittle bit it looks like these two\nthough are just going to they're content\nto hang together Alexa kind of hanging a\ncouple just a couple feet off the back\nof Sophia's wheel but uh they seem to be\ncontent to kind of ride this at\nTempo Alexis has played it smart worked\nto get across but then is just sitting\nin and probably giving herself a chance\nto recover riding a smart race\ntoday now back in the chase group we've\ngot Jenna Reinhardt dictating Pace along\nwith an experence erience of Aaron Huck\nwe've also got Sam Shepard I would\nimagine that Sam is really motivated to\ndo her first round of the lifetime Grand\nPrix and show how strong she has come\noff of the winter after racing Cape\nepic if Alexis is able to keep in\ncontact this is a fantastic situation\nfor the two of them as they come up and\nover the climb and head towards the\nsingle track on The Descent to the\ntrack all right we've got our leading\nwomen coming through right now that is\ngoing to be Sophia Gomez visha leading\nthe Char she's got the company of Alexis\nscarda with her as well so those two\nriders coming through in about 2 hours\nand 17 minutes or so so that is very\nvery fast\ntime somara Shepard coming through\nHannah Auto Aaron Huck Jen Reinhardt the\n36 seconds the Gap to our two\nleaders and there you have it your lead\nwomen have completed lap one here inside\nthe lagona sea\nRaceway you know know Laguna sea has\nbeen the home for the sea otter classic\nsince its Inception back in the early\n'90s for 34 years bike fans from all\nover the world have been making the\nannual pilgrimage to the Selenas Valley\nfor a bit more about the event here's\nJeff Frost once again with what he\nthinks makes the sea otter classic the\nevent of the\nseason sea otter is a fixture in the\nworld of cycling when we first started\nthe trade show was kind of a sideshow if\nyou will to the racing well now it hosts\n9,000 athletes and 74,000 fans so the\nrise has been meteoric you've got so\nmany different brands we're all super\npassionate about it and it's just so\nsick to see everyone come around and\ncome together and just promote the thing\nthat we all love it's the place to be\nit's the place to check out gear a lot\nof times it's the people that started\nthe company are here there's just so\nmuch going going on sort of like coella\nbut for\nbikes you know this is something where\nthe entire industry shows up and they're\nbringing all the newest gear in Tech and\nthe fans get opportunity to check all\nthis stuff out this year alone we have\nover 1,000 vendors in attendance which\nis a record here at se it's almost like\na reunion every year I might not go to\nas many races anymore but I know I'll\nprobably see all my buddies at sea\notter downhill practice for the juniors\nright now Wyatt 8 years old hello is uh\nracing downhill for his fourth year in a\nrow third I missed one well\nyeah when you walk away from the\nlifetime seaotter classic you go wow\nthat was cool I got to hang out with my\nbuddies I got to ride my bike and I got\nto walk around and see products that I\nhavn't known existed I mean if you're a\nfan of cycling and you have yet to\nexperience the sea otter classic it's\nsomething you simply have to do to truly\nappreciate how special this place\nis Amen to that so for those of you out\nthere in the crowd you've got about an\nhour or so before the elite men make\ntheir way back into the venue so go out\nthere grab a hot dog something to drink\nhigh five some budies and enjoy all that\nthe Expo has to offer and with that\nlet's kick it back out to our team in\nthe field for the latest on where things\nstand with the men at the Fuego\nXL thanks Bill our men are out here\nmaking their way through lap two we\nstill have a big lead group you have to\nimagine it's only a matter of time\nbefore someone starts to make a move and\nbreak this pack\nup when you're in a big group like this\nyou have to know that there's a lot of\nhorsepower that can chase attacks down\nso it's really challenging to make moves\nwith so many players in the\ngame you know we just caught back up\nwith our lead men it looks as though\nMatt beers is pushing the pace up this\nhill Lexi veran getting ready to take a\npull through and of course Keegan right\nthere sitting on his wheel so looks like\nthese three guys have have put a little\ngap on the rest of the group and uh they\nseem to be working together well you\nhave to be patient but you also need to\nre re the people you kind of figure out\nokay this gu is moving up the right now\nokay what's happening on the left in the\nmiddle kind of be very hyper aware of\nyour surroundings and\nthen use your common sense to kind of\nmake the right decision in that moment\nabout 5 Seconds back we've got a Chase\ngroup here with Cole Patton leading the\ncharge trying to make that bridge across\nHoward gr sitting there on his wheel\nlooks pretty comfortable on his wheel\nbut it's all happening\n1 minute 2 minutes it's a little bit of\ninstinct and also not\noverthinking they hit a little bit of a\ndescent here and Keegan decided to come\nto the front and try to shake it up he's\nputting a little gap on\nAlexi this year I'd like to not have it\ncome down to a Sprint if I can that was\na little bit stressful last year with\nRussell is just looks really comfortable\nspinning he so fluid and then you can\nsee Alexi back there on that straight\nsection rocking his shoulder much bigger\ngear grinding to try and get back on\nKeegan's wheel they know that they're\ncoming up to the climb to look out Ridge\nyou race enough and you know you've won\nenough races and had some success you\nyou start to like just get a sense of\nlike oh like these guys are hurting it's\nlike time to go or like if you have a\nsmall Gap like it's time to push hey so\nTim we saw you uh we out there on the\nebike caught back up to Matt beers how\nare things looking down there hey chemo\nthese guys are flying the downhill\nKeegan is making his move and Matt and\nAlexi are doing everything they can to\nkeep\nup I heard Alexi make a mistake and I\nwas like oh now we go it is so\nimpressive to see Keegan descending away\nfrom the other leaders in the field you\nknow they still only got about a\n5-second gap so it's the the race isn't\nover yet but Keegan sure does look solid\nright now as Racers we kind of call it\nlike snapping the\nelastic like you can snap the elastic\nthey can no longer see you then they\nthey start racing each other it makes it\nso hard mentally though to have let that\nGap go on a descent and to know that\nyou're going to have to chase down one\nof the strongest climbers that rides on\ndirt these days so you just need to like\nbreak them have like a small Gap and\nthen you can slowly build it um and\nreally just maintain it and I think that\ntakes a lot of time to kind of hone that\nlike steady\nthrottle and here goes Keegan\nmaking his way up Lookout I've gotten to\nbe a little better at that in the past\nI've like gone too hard and blown up or\nor whatnot so I think it's like it's a\nbit of an art to like learn how to how\nto do that but also like you know if the\nrace comes down and there's like three\nor four of us you also have to know how\nto win a race that\nway you know chemo for every one of\nthese athletes racing today racing near\nthe front they have to be constantly on\nwatch for what we talk about as being\nthe moment in in the race sometimes\nyou're the rider who can sense that the\nopportunity is there and it's yours for\nthe taking and you make the move and\nrecognize that you are in that moment\nand now Alexia is pulling away from Matt\nthis this is really blowing up here on\nLookout and that's that that Mark of the\nchampion all right SE otter what we're\nhearing out on the course is that Keegan\nswensson separated from the field on a\ndownhill section before Lookout Alexi\nand Matt were on the chase but I think\nwe all know at this point that you're\nnot going to catch Keegan on a climb at\nthe end of the race grab something to\ndrink and get on over to the Finish Line\nbecause Keegan should be entering Laguna\nsea any moment now it is ever so sweet\nto be able to put your hands up in the\nair and celebrate a solo win ladies and\ngentlemen he is just about onto the\npavement right now so we're going to\nmake a little bit of noise this guy is\nput on a phenomenal show beating his\ntime from last year SE meet the new boss\nthe same as he old bot this is Keegan\nsnon here we see Alexi veran coming in\nlooks like he's he's given about a\nminute up to Keegan but uh he's going to\ncome away with second place\npoints just behind him have Matt\nbe don't go anywhere we still got lots\nof finishers to come through as our\nElite women out there doing battle to\nsee who's going to be the queen of the\nhere\ntoday we're back here with our lead\nwomen and it's still Alexis and Sophia\ntogether in front Alexis put in that big\neffort to break away from the chase\ngroup and close the gap to Sophia yeah\nso now the question is how many matches\ndid she burn to do that and will she be\nable to hang with Sophia until the\nend there comes a moment in the race\nwhen you can feel that all of the\ntension is raised and that's when you\nreally have to start looking around and\ndeciding what strategy is going to suit\nyou\nB you can see Sophia and Alexis out\nthere and our Chasers look to be about a\nminute down if people are starting to\nhurt you can slowly start to ratchet up\nthe pace to make people start to\nquestion their will Hannah Auto in first\nwheel followed by Sam Shepard Aaron huff\nand Jenna Reinhardt looking very strong\nfast and smooth as they go through this\nsection of single\ntrack Alexis is looking for a\npool\nno our Chase group five women currently\nbeing led by Hannah\nAuto and Haley Smith sitting second\nwheel rejoining from behind as Sam\nShepard takes to the front with an\nattack and now so is pulling away from\nscarta sopia is smashing\nthis she looks to have put a couple\nminute Gap here on\nAlexis so showing everybody that she\nmeans business in the 2024 lifetime\nGrand Prix presented by Mazda Alexis\nstill in Pursuit and our group of five\nled by Hannah utto not far behind\nper my lungs are burning my legs are\nhurting My Mind Is Telling Me No stop\nlike I I don't want to feel\nthat but I'm telling myself push past\nthat push past that\nwall all right word on the street is\nthat it's Sophia out front solo after\nAlexis lost contact and she has a Chase\ngroup motoring right along it's setting\nup to be another Showdown on\nLookout sopia has made it up to Lookout\nRidge she has a pretty incredible\nGap oh there's Alexa\nCora this could be a battle for second\nand\nthird let's see if Hanah shelle see that\ntoo that's definitely going to be a\ncarrot for Sam and Hanah\nAO oh Alexa is just Alexis is just blown\nup being able to see a rider in front\nand chase them down is super motivating\neverything\nhurts but you're near the finish so you\nyou you just dig deep you keep pushing\nhard Sam's going for\nAlexis this is going to going to be\nit confidence comes from execution so\nwhen you're able to execute one thing\nwell you gain confidence and that\nconfidence allows you to execute\nsomething else well SE let's bring it up\na notch this is your Champion once again\nhere at seot welcome home Sophia Gomez\nvisha I just push hard\nyeah it just gives you another another\nlevel of energy and\nstrength and this is it Sam sheeper\nmaking contact with Alexis scara's wheel\nand going by not waiting for Alexis to\nbe able to jump back on Alexis out of\nthe saddle trying to maintain contact\nwith Sam Shepard wow chemo what a ride\nby the Kiwi ah 2K to go she catches her\nand she just blows by like she's\nstanding still doesn't even give her a\nchance to get on her wheel she knows to\nrace a bike and look at her on this hill\nshe is already opening up a gap and you\ncan see Alexis looks like she's already\nbacked off she to dig deep and to\novercome to deep the other Riders you\njust have to want it badly Camp Shephard\nwhat a solid first day for her in the\nGrand Prix here we have it Janelle\nHannah Auto just caught Alexa scarta\nwent by her again didn't even slow down\nlook at she's standing sprinting away so\nshe's now moved into third place and she\nis still gunning for Sam Shephard oh I\njust I feel absolutely for Alexa starter\nyou can see how deflated she is I\nprepared as well as I could have I put\nin everything I could to be on the start\nline so I wanted to make it worthwhile\nand my mind was not settling for less\nthan what I the best I could give on the\nday all right put your hands together\nhere what a phenomenal ride very happy\nso Shephard with that silver medal\nperformance here today taking a quick\nlook back over her shoulder she's going\nto see Hannah Auto in the distance uto\nwith a phenomenal ride picking up a\nbronze and a welcome home third place\nHannah\nAuto and our fourth place finisher Haley\nSmith at a late charge at the end of the\nrace and Alexis scarter rounding out the\ntop five what a phenomenal finish for\nall these\nwomen it was an all out grit your teeth\nkind of finish nothing quite brings on\nthe Ecstasy like that crossing the\nFinish Line knowing you definitely had\nto earn it your bronze medalist Hannah\nAuto I haven't raced many of these girls\nat all before so it's a bit of a see how\neveryone's going and um everyone's going\nreally fast it turns out she needs all\nalmost no introduction Sophia Gomez\nV the athletes here in the Grand Prix\njust keep bringing the level up every\nyear everyone's more prepared everyone\nis more focused in on these\nevents on today Matthew beard as a ro\nmve to the mountain bike slowly he\ntaking a couple years to even be able to\nfollow these guys through single track\nand hopefully slowly getting closer to\nscaring Keegan a little\nbit I know Sophia is also on another\nlevel so I think it's going to be a\nreally competitive season I'm excited\nabout it I love these events as they get\nharder and harder and I think that's\nkind of what you need as an after yeah I\ndon't know if the season is going to go\nwell but that's kind of\nexciting that was an incredible day of\nracing and such a proper start to what\npromises to be a season unlike any other\nnext up probably the most infamous\ndaunting event in the Grand Prix here's\nKimo Seymour once again to give us a\npreview of what we can expect to see on\nJune 1st at Unbound\ngravel one thing that makes this series\nso compelling is the diversity of races\nthese athletes are forced to\nface and that contrast couldn't be more\napparent than going from this course at\nsea otter to race number two the 200 Mi\nof rolling Flint Hills of Kansas at\nUnbound gravel fortunately these Riders\nhave till the end of May to train those\nlegs and tune their\nengines no matter how you feel about\nyour results here whether good or bad\nthere's no candy coating the challenge\nthat lies\nahead last year proved to be full of\nsurprises and a little drama both bikes\nand bodies\nfalter our riders with stood 10 to 13\nhours of crushing mud drenching rain and\nsweltering\nheat and they are all coming back for\nmore whether you're leaving seot or\nlooking for a comeback or Defending Your\nPosition everyone has their work cut out\nfor\nthem well that's it for us here in\nMonteray on behalf of Kimo Seymour\nJanelle spilker and the rest of our\nproduction team I'm Bill Ellison saying\nthank you for tuning in and we'll see\nyou next time in Emporia\nn\noh"
