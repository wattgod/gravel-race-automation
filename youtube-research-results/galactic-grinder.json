      "description": "April 6th in Cedar Hill, New Mexico\n\nThis route is almost all dirt, with a touch of pavement, and includes 4 miles of the Alien Run single track. You'll encounter steep punchy climbs up to 12%, and breathtaking views, all on some of the most remote gas field roads we have to offer. \n\nMileage offered includes distances of 9 miles, 35 miles and 50 miles. These roads may be rougher than other gravel event roads and there is 3.8 miles of singletrack on the alien trail. Make sure your gravel bike is up for the burly roads NM has to offer! If you don't have a gravel bike a mountain bike is perfectly acceptable.",
