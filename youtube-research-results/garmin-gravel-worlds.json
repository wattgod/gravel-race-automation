event 2023 what it\nis love you thank you God bless\nthank you City of Lincoln for all you've\ndone to help make this an incredible\nevent and welcome the thousands of\npeople here to Lincoln for gravel World\nmake sure you check out all the fun\nthings Lincoln Nebraska has to do\nwhat's up gravel family I just want to\ngive a huge shout out to our sponsors\nthank you so much big and small we are\nso appreciative of you hey everyone we\nwant to thank\nthe communities in Lancaster County the\nsurrounding counties around there and\nKaren\nthank you\nall right what's Up grandma family I'm\nJason I'm going to get into the rider\nvideo but before we get into that the\npeople that were just uh introducing\nthis video that's the entire gravel\nworlds team I know I get a lot of\nattention on social media uh because\nthat's my job but it's an entire team so\nbe sure if you see them uh be sure to\nthank them thank the volunteers uh thank\neverybody that makes this event possible\num and it's not about me it's about the\nwhole team so let's get into the rider\nvideo here and we're just gonna go\nthrough it as quick as we can and this\nshould have all the information that you\nshould need if you're coming to Lincoln\nso let's make this happen uh check in\nhow do we get it checked in so uh\nwhether you're doing the 10k run all the\nway up to the 300 mile race uh bike race\nyou have to check in you have to get a\nnumber plate you have to get uh signed\nin so that you're registered on our\ntiming and you get your swag bag and all\nthat stuff so if you've been to gravel\nworlds before in the last several years\ncheck-in is going to be in a similar\nplace it's not going to be in the church\nlike normal it's but it's in the same\nbuilding on the same side of the\nbuilding too so you'll follow signs on\nthe northwest side of the Schilling\nbridge building and you will see check\nin right there follow the signs\nprimary check-in is Thursday noon to 7\np.m and Friday 10 a.m to 7 P.M so those\nare your primary locations if you at all\ncan make that happen make that possible\nif the only time you can check in is\nearly race day on the run or early race\nday on the bike the sign in early\ncheck-in starts at 4 30 in the morning\nagain we do not have the resources or\nvolunteers to check in hundreds of\npeople on Race morning so make that as a\nlast possible ditch option for you so\nthere you go race day what to expect on\nrace day we recommend you be lined up\nfor your race 30 minutes prior to your\nstart time so 6 a.m for the 150 we\nrecommend you get there about 5 30 and\nbe prepared for traffic we got hundreds\nof people coming in we do try to spread\nyou out all around the neighborhood so\nyou're coming in at different entrances\nso be sure that you follow the\ninstructions on your parking which we'll\ntalk about that earlier\num for the start of the the 150 race\nsimilar to last year we are having the\nelite women at the front uh there will\nbe a break and then a of an ATV that'll\nbe blocking and then they'll be the\nelite men and outside of that we will\nhave uh on the side of the road you'll\nsee uh timing estimates of uh seven\nhours eight hours nine hours ten hours\nand then I think 11 12 plus so please\nline up at your estimated finish time so\nwhat you think about the time that\nyou're going to finish line up at those\ntiming spots on race day for the 75 and\nthe 150. that's very important for\nsafety that makes sure that you're not\nin over your head riding with the pros\nat the front that are going to be going\nway too fast for you also making sure\nyou're not going to get left behind by\npeople that you could be riding with all\nday so please for safety and for a\nbetter experience for yourself don't\nline up too far in the front yeah it\ndefinitely is not going to help you\nthere so\num and then that should be it for race\nday lineup behind the arch and have a\ngood time enjoy the hype and the the\npump up before we get going before the\nquiet of the gravel Seas start all right\nnext up we're going to talk about rules\nwe have very few rules but they're very\nimportant so go ahead and follow along\nrule number one always been the rule of\ngravel worlds be cool uh it's it's\nreally simple but it goes a long way so\nif you kind of have to ask it's probably\nnot cool so basically the Golden Rule be\nkind to other people other people's\nthings and you're going to be good to\nthat so some examples of being not cool\nyelling at volunteers cutting course\ncheating uh walking or riding off of the\npublic roads and onto private Fields\ncussing out a competitor or hiding\nfeedbacks on course all of those are not\ncool they go against all of our rules so\njust be kind to other people you're\ngoing to be fine with us be kind to our\nvolunteers be kind to our promotion\nstaff and we're going to be all good\nrule number two is basically if we've\ndeemed that you're super not cool in the\npast we can reject you being able to be\na part of our event in the current and\nin the future so be careful with that\nrule number three uh you bikes and\nhelmets this is obviously not for our\nRunners you do have to have a bike with\nfunctioning brakes so even if you're\nriding with a fixie you do have to have\nbrakes on you e-bikes are not allowed\nexcept in our 50k category so that's a\nnon-competitive race so you can use an\ne-bike in our 50K\num and then also helmets you have to\nwear a helmet at all times that includes\ngroup rides that includes on the way to\nthe course uh and everywhere you are out\nof course a helmet is required at all\ntimes and that does have to be a modern\nhelmet so no uh like old school 1980s\n1990s pads on on your head has to be a\nmodern helmet rule number four and we\ntake this one very seriously do not\nlitter our roads around here are\nremarkably clean we hope you notice that\nwhen you're here compared to a lot of\nother gravel races you might find a beer\ncan or deer on or two on the course\nyou'll definitely probably see those\nfrom time to time but overall our course\nis clean and litter is how our race is\ngoing to get shut down it's an easy way\nfor locals to say hey look they're\ntrashing our roads because there's 500\ngel packets out here\ntossing bottles no go like you you are\nresponsible for whatever you take out on\ncourse you have to throw away or take\nback with you\num it's easy to take them put them in\nyour pocket we have several places on\ncourse\nthat you can throw away trash so make\nsure you keep that with you rule number\nfive plan your Voyage you are\nresponsible for your Excursion uh this\nis a self-supported race we'll get into\nthat a little bit more but you need to\nhave a plan for your race so uh have a\nbailout option have options for your\nnutrition for that day so you know\nwhat's going on but you are responsible\nfor you all right rule number six do not\nmodify your number plate this has kind\nof become an issue uh more recently\ntrying to save a half a watt do not\nmodify your number plate the biggest\nreason is this actually drastically\naffects our timing which is a way a big\nform of safety we need to know where\npeople are at what times when you cross\nthose timers if you wrap your number\nplate around your head tube those RFID\ntags do not work so it affects the\nquality of our event it affects our\ntiming people that are running around\nall the time trying to track you down to\nfigure out what number plate just\ncrossed a timing plate or a Finish Line\nso do not modify your number plates do\nnot do it rule number seven this is kind\nof also involving equipment bike lights\nare required for the 150 and the 300. no\nno questions about it it's state law it\nwe start the race at night the biggest\nreason we start the race at night is to\nkeep temperatures down there's always a\npotential it could be nearly 100 degrees\nso we start in the dark it's also really\ncool to be starting in the quiet calm of\nthe day in the dark so bike lights are\nrequired for the 150 and 300 front and\nrear uh then Aero bars we do allow Aero\nbars but only if you are at the front of\na group or by yourself if you are in the\nmiddle of a pack with a group of people\nor just two people if you're just\ndrafting one person Aero bars are not\nallowed that's simply for safety uh you\nif you're down in your aerobars you\ncan't react you can't break so Aero bars\nare allowed if you're at the front of a\ngroup or by yourself yeah\nall right rule number eight respect your\nfellow athlete this kind of goes back to\nrule number one you'll notice a lot of\nour rules have just evolved around\nrespect so rule number eight respect\nyour fellow athletes encourage each\nothers help each other out and need\ndisrespect of other athletes through\nharassment or profanities will not be\ntolerated and you will be disqualified\nall right and Rule Number Nine no\noutside support our race is is\nself-supported once you leave the start\nline every single athlete has the same\nopportunity as everybody else everybody\nhas the same checkpoint experience\neverybody has the same gas station stops\nif they need it everybody has the same\nOasis so if you once you leave you that\nyou make sure you have everything you\nneed there's no team Vehicles out on\ncourse there's no uh team members out at\ncheckpoints to hand stuff out to you if\nthere's something specific you need for\nyour adventure you need to bring that\nwith you so if that's a special\nnutrition hydration tools whatever it is\nyou have to bring that with you we will\nhave nutrition options from goo Funk\nbreaker salt stick uh Cliff Bars and as\nwell as basic nutrition and snacks out\nat our checkpoint we have piedmontese\nhot dogs back again we'll have Cokes\nchips cookies things like that but if\nthere's something specific you need and\nyou can't find it at a gas station out\non course you need to bring that with\nyou\num also with self-supported navigation\nis on you this year we are going to be\nmarking the Run courses so run courses\nwill be marked we recommend if you have\nyour Garmin watch to still load your\ncourses on there just to be safe there's\nalways a chance some kids going to be\nmessing around and mess up our signs so\nmake sure if you can we recommend you\nstill have it on there but on the bike\nside you are responsible for for your\nnavigation all the way down to the 50k\nyou are responsible for your navigation\nout on course so make sure you have that\nwith you in some fashion whether that's\nan actual head unit a Garmin head unit\nor you're using Strava or ride with GPS\nor some other third-party turn-by-turn\ndirection you have to have that out\nthere no pre-arranged team support and\nagain I say pre-arranged we understand\nthere are going to be times where\nsomebody's going to be drafting with a\nteammate that's totally okay but no\ndomestics no uh things like that where\nsomebody's riding up ahead to fill up\nbottles none of that it's your race it's\nyour race versus everybody else's race\nno team tactics here but also that also\nmeans no team Vehicles out on course uh\nyou can't have Team Vehicles out on\ncourse we do allow media Vehicles if you\nwant a media pass reach out to us we are\nbeing very strict on that this year of\nwhat that means so if you have a media\npass you cannot interact with any\nathletes out on course so\num yeah no team Vehicles no interaction\nat all out on course with your athletes\nthis also means no driving out on course\nI know we get this question a lot from\nfamily members I know you're really\nexcited to see your your athletes out on\ncourse but just for safety just pure\nsafety uh reasons we cannot have 2 000\nvehicles of family members out on course\ncourses kind of zigzag each other all\nover the place so you might think you're\non one course but you're actually\ndriving up and over a hill onto another\ncourse that you didn't know was there so\nno driving out on course if you are\ninterested in being out on course we\nrecommend you volunteer at our\ncheckpoint every single Rider goes\nthrough our checkpoint so not only do\nyou get to help your Rider and see and\ncheer them on you get a cheer on\neverybody else so no vehicles out on\ncourse what what is required out on\ncourse with self-supported so every\nsingle person is required to go through\nour checkpoint so we have two\ncheckpoints on the 150 one on the 75 and\none on the 50k you are required to go\nthrough those there is a timing mat to\nmake sure that you do go through you are\nnot required to stop so if that is a\nrace strategy that you want to carry 150\nmiles of water and you don't want to\nstop at the checkpoints that's on you\nyou don't have to stop you do have to go\nthrough them there's also no racing\ninside the checkpoint area so when\nyou're on the property of the the\ncheckpoints you're not making moves\nthere that's not where you're going to\nwin or lose a race is actually making a\nmove there so keep your speeds down we\ndo have gravel cross this year at\ncheckpoint one on the 150 so there is a\ncyclocross course that every Rider is\nrequired to go and do it's going to be\nreally fun it's only like 0.4 miles that\nadds on to the course but it'll zigzag\nalong the course there on the farm of\nthe checkpoint\nuh we have several Oasis out on course\nthese are not required to stop at for\nanybody so there'll be several several\nwater stops uh several just Oasis\nsponsored by different businesses so\nthose are not required but if you want\nto uh if you're out of water or need\nsome extra assistance you can do that\nthere are also two gas stations on the\n75 and 150 course those are for you to\nuse as you as you wish so go in there\nget some snacks if you need to use the\nrestroom go in there but go ahead and\ncheck those out and like I said too the\nlast bit is there something specific\nnutritionally that you need uh that you\nneed to bring that with you so if\nthere's a specific goo that you need or\ngel if there's a specific allergy for\nfood you have to carry that with you so\nno drop bags no handouts out at the\ncheckpoints all right next we are going\nto talk about parking so on the Expo day\nand check-in on Thursday and Friday you\ncan park at the Meredith parking lot or\nyou can park on the grassy area behind\nShilling Bridge next to the Expo you'll\nsee signs out for that please park in\nthose areas do not park in the paved\nparking spots on Thursday and Friday\nplease leave those for local businesses\nthey need to be running their businesses\non Thursday and Friday so we have plenty\nof parking for you over at Emeritus and\nin the green grassy area on race day uh\nFriday you will if you're doing the run\nyou can still park over at Emeritus over\nthere or in the grassy area when you\ncheck in for bike racing day you will\nreceive a parking pass when you check in\nof where you should be going for race\nday check-in or for

      "description": "Gravel Worlds was hard. First time in a race that I cared less about personal performance and achievements. I just wanted to finish and say I did it. This was the toughest race I\u2019ve ever done. I\u2019ve done Unbound 100 twice, Skinny Tire Festival, Tour De Lakes, and Muleskinner, but for some reason GW - 75 (78 \ud83d\ude09) seems a lot difficult. The most I\u2019ve ever climbed in a race. From starting out of the gates hot in the 1st half to bonking during 2nd half, Gravel Worlds threw everything at everyone. That said, what I like about these races is the encouragement from other riders even when they are struggling. It\u2019s truly a big family out there and everyone is there to finish and have fun. So I\u2019ve done the 30 and 75 at Gravel Worlds and will be back again to the 150 next.\n\n- Gravel Wolds Privateer - 75 @gravel_worlds \n- 3,132 Calories burn\n- 5,492 feet of climbing\n- 6 bottles of water and a water pack. Thanks @polarbottle and @camelbak \n- dozen gels\n- One lost bottle\n- 200 potholes\n- 20 miles of bonking\n- Max speed 38 mph\n- 1000s of people cheering \ud83d\udce3 us on\n- dozens of people creating their own mini support stations to help out the riders\n- 3 hours of extreme heat\n- the countless amount of hills. Omg \n- got to say hey \ud83d\udc4b to the podcaster I listen to. @jasonstrohbehn @sofiasedona on @gravelfamilypodcast and got a shoutout from them when I finished!!! \n- got 4 points from @garmin connect for completing Privateer 75\n- photos capture by my iPhone and Insta360 \n- beat the heat\n- Canyon Grail AL 7.0 \n- 3rd longest ride (personal)\n- On to 150 next year \n\nBike & Race Gear: \nCanyon Grail Gravel Bike\nGarmin 830 Computer\nCamelbak\nTopeak Multi-Tool\nTubeless Tires\n12-Speed\nGels\n\nPhotography \n@jrw_shoots \nInsta360X3\niPhone\n\n#gravel #garmin #gravelworlds #lincoln #NEB #NEBRASKA #racing #cycling #canyon #75miles #cyclingclub #green #canyongrailal #rain #weather #Finished #goals #hot #bonking #gravelfamily",
