I registered for the Gran race distance (80 miles), but skipped the green river cove switchbacks and added the end of the medio course for a little over 70 miles. Filmed on GoPro Hero9.",

      "transcript": "Good morning folks from uh Greenville,\nSouth Carolina. Not to be confused with\nGreenville, North Carolina. Uh there are\ntwo Greenvilles and I I guess that begs\nthe question, what's the point of naming\na city? Uh although the same argument\ncould be said of, you know, a North and\na South Carolina. Uh we don't need to\nget into that. Uh, I'm on the lovely\nSwamp Rabbit Trail, which I love the\nname and I love the trail uh which\nconnects the city of Greenville to uh\nTravelers Rest, which is kind of a\nsuburb, but it's a beautiful bike path\nsituation. One of those old rails to\ntrails conversions. Uh it's a nice\nSaturday morning. Lots of folks out\nhere, families and kids, and\nyou know, there's shops. Uh I started\nthe day at the Tandem crepery\nuh and coffee as both of those. The It\nwas It was a really long line. Get there\nearly. Um but uh it's tasty. And now\nwe're just going to go for a nice little\nspin in uh in Greenville. Of course,\nthis trip will include an attempt on\nParis Mountain. Uh but we'll get to that\nlater. I'm going to have a nice a nice\nlittle ride and show you the town some\nfirst.\nExcuse\nme. There's all kinds of uh really nice\nshops and cafes along the the path. Uh\nI'm enjoying a cookie from the Commons\nand a Methodical Coffee where the line\nwas uh was a lot more doable than the\ntandem crepe spot. Um all quite tasty.\nThe bike path goes all the way downtown\nuh where there's a beautiful walking\narea, there's a waterfall, all these\ncool cafes uh and it goes directly to\nwhere I'm staying uh at the embassy\nsuites right to the door. So, I didn't I\nhaven't touched pavement uh or not\npavement with cars on this whole ride.\nSo, Greenville was the host of the\nNational Road Race Championships for I\nthink it was four or five years when I\nfirst started racing. Um, the Paris\nMountain was a legendary climb of that\nroad race. Uh, we'd go up it four times\nevery year and then you'd go like kind\nof finish in downtown. So, a very\nchallenging uh KM I'll be going for\ntoday and one with a lot of history on\nit. Greenville is where actually I got\nmy tattoo. It was right after one of\nthose national championships. Uh I was\nout there with Kenda Pro Cycling. I must\nhave been I was 24 25. Um the the race\ndidn't go well. You don't get a clean\ntattoo after a race that goes well. Um\nit was uh one of those like I've been\ndoing everything I could and uh I've\nbeen at it a few years. Um and and I was\nwinning, you know, a lot of the races\navailable to me. and then uh line up for\nthis one and it was I was just so far\nfrom where I thought I needed to be uh\nit was quite discouraging. So me and uh\nmy teammate at the time Nick Wait went\nout to it was one of those like I had\nthe idea and he was like yeah I want to\nget the tattoo also and uh so we just\ndid it right away before we could change\nour minds. We went to only tattoo place\nwe could find it was like a Sunday night\nwas in like Spartanberg nearby like\nbehind a gas station. It was pretty bad.\nBut I had to get it touched up a couple\ntimes. It's it's it's okay now. Uh do a\nlittle recon on Paris Mountain. It's\nhilarious. I definitely would have raced\nup this climb I think a total like 12\ntimes. I don't remember anything. But\nthe thing is all climbs are kind of the\nsame. Don't remember this guy in the uh\nthe race. Appreciate it. Um I do\nremember I was in the early break uh\nlast time I raced up this. It's where I\nmet uh good friend Jesse Anthony uh for\nthe first time. Always a fun place to to\nget to know somebody. It's in a fiveman\nbreakaway at nationals. Uh also got into\nit with Jason McCartney who was on Radio\nShack at the time. We were teams a\ncouple years later. He was all right.\nEveryone gets aggro in races. It's a I\ndon't know. Don't have great memories\nfrom this, but it's a beautiful climb.\nIt's a very nice day in Greenville. and\nuh see if we can Well, we've already\nimproved on my on my past Greenville\nexperiences. Uh I'm I'm enjoying myself\nhere, but we'll see if we can put the\nicing on the cake with this\nbeautiful climb, nice views. Uh it's 2.2\nmi. Um average 7%. Uh the KM it's 8\nminutes and 22 seconds, something like\nthat. Uh held by Chris Butler. Now Chris\nButler is a local rider. I don't know if\nhe's originally from from Greenville,\nbut he lived here since I ever heard of\nhim. Uh I believe he went to Ferman\nUniversity, which is down there. And to\nfor those I looked it up. Furman\nUniversity. I I was always told that it\nwas the their mascot was the Christian\nKnights. So you can figure out what\nFerman University Christian Knights had\non the t-shirt. Uh that's a myth. That's\na myth, which was very disappointing to\nme. I do believe you can get the\nt-shirts, but it's not real.\nUh Chris Butler was uh he raced\nprofessionally honestly like the same\nyears that I did, a little bit younger\nthan me, but uh was on a couple world\ntour teams, proati teams, did the Europe\nthing uh and and lived here. And he was\na cler by the way. So Chris was uh like\nat my best. I think I I I think I could\nbeat him sometimes and he could beat me\nsometimes uh depending on if it was\nsteep. He's a smaller guy. So steep\ngradient and Chris Butler was absolutely\nworld class. He got this K while he was\nracing. So I'm not put this I'm not\noptimistic uh that I can get this K. But\nif I knew I could get it, it wouldn't be\ninteresting. And if I That's not safe.\nThat's not safe at all. That wasn't safe\nat all.\nUh so anyway, if I knew I could get it,\nit wouldn't be interesting. And uh if I\naccomplished all my goals, what would I\ndo tomorrow? Either way, tomorrow I'm\ngoing to take a day a day easy.\nOh, so I did fly here with the sea\nsucker rack uh in my suitcase to put on\nthe rental car. Uh that worked out real\nnice. The other sea sucker that I've got\nis uh is holding the camera mount that\nI'm holding right now. Um and that's\ngoing to go on the car. So my camera\nperson this trip, my camera people uh\nare my mom and my stepdad.\nUh, so there will be no there'll be no\ncomplaints about the camera video\nquality. You guys had a uh you had a\ncrepe today. The crepe the line was too\nlong for me the other day. Uh, how was\nthe crepe?\nI thought it was great. We shared\ncrepe was awesome. Yeah,\ncrepe. It\nwas very good.\nAnd and you've enjoyed Greenville. They\ntook a little trip up from Atlanta. A\nfew hour drive. You guys are enjoying\nGreenville\nvery much.\nVery much. And Earl Earl got the hat.\nYep.\nAll right, let's do this.\nHeat up\n[Music]\nhere.\nHeat. Heat.\nIt's\nAll right. So, I missed it about like 10\n11 seconds.\nLittle more sleep, a little more\nsomething. I could have had it, but that\nwas my best effort for today. Uh, great\ntime again in Greenville, South\nCarolina. If you go to Greenville, North\nCarolina, you'll be like, \"Where's\nEmbassy Suites? Where's the cool\nrestaurants? Where's the Paris\nMountain?\" It's not my fault. I told you\nSouth Carolina. So, head over there.\nEnjoy your trip. See you next time."
