      "transcript": "The Grasshoppers are a NorCal cycling\ntradition of adventure, camaraderie, and\ncompetition. Today we are out here\nriding the King Route, a road event that\nwill be held May 10th. Road? What? This\nis gravel. This is Grasshopper. What are\nyou talking about? Oh, I Yeah, I thought\nWell, you know, a good ride's a good\nride. And out around here, uh, it just\nhappens to be, but some of the most\nspectacular road riding for Chance in\nthe world. So, I mean, I need to put\nhave that as part of our series. You've\nput on mountain bike events, you put on\nroad events. A lot of them span the\nspectrum. Way before gravel was even a\nthing, you were doing these\nmulti-surface events. So, it's a treat\nfor me to get out here and ride these\nroads. Some of which are dirt, some of\nwhich are paved, some of which are are\nchunky pavement. And we invite you to\ncome along for the ride.\n[Applause]\n[Music]\nriding in uh this part of the world in\nthis corner uh is very special and\nunique. Uh the geography is very\nparticular with I guess the meeting of\nthe tectonic plates here makes it like\nso rugged and it's very unexpected what\nis coming next and that keeps it uh very\nvery fun and challenging and yeah makes\nit for very fun riding. So the\ngrasshoppers are one of the best\ninterjections of like getting people\nconnected with nature, enjoying being\nwith each other, big sense of commuting\nit, pushing each other. Either you want\nto push or not, the terrain kind of\nmakes you push it and brings the\nchallenge and it always feels good. Uh\nat the end of the day, many grasshopper\nevents are point-to-point races. The\nKing Ridge is the timed segment format.\nFor the long route, there are three\nsegments. For the short, there are two.\nI like this format because you get to\nscratch the competitive itch, go hard,\nand then when you get dropped, you get\nto regroup with your old and new\nfriends. What was the thinking for you\nbehind as a promoter behind these time\nsegments? Well, it's interesting you\nasked that. So, it is unique to the\nGrasshoppers. We've done that uh once\nbefore. So, uh the first reason is to\nput on an event back in Sonoma County\nwhere I felt that it was safe, you know,\nwith the size of our riders and it's on\nopen roads. um that's above anything\nelse is the most important and I wanted\nto do a big epic loop in Sonoma County.\nRight. So I'm calling this the greatest\nhits. We have Joy and Coleman Valley and\nKing Rage, but we have sections of\nHighway 1. This is a chance for us to\nreally push ourselves. They're really\nhard long segments, but like you said,\nto be able to regroup and to to gather\nafterwards, tell stories a little bit\nand then and then, you know, roll on\nout. For people unfamiliar with the\narea, briefly walk us through the\ncourse, where we start, how we climb up\nand over the ridge down to the ocean.\nYeah, so we start in Duncan Mills. It's\na small little town of less than a\nthousand people on the Russian River, a\ncouple miles from the coast. And uh we\nwe roll out up overland. We used to\nstart through Freestone. And uh and then\nwe climb up Joyce. We're heading out\ntowards Bedadega, which is a famous\nlittle town where Hitchcock filmed the\nbirds. This is rural western Soma\nCounty. We call it Oxonal, the West\nPole. Okay. Um, it's kind of the the hub\nof road rides, adventures, and out to\nthe coast. There are some steep kickers\ncoming up and over the bridge here. What\nWhat is this gradient? This is like\nright at the start of this climb. Oh no.\nStart of segment one kicking the teeth.\nI'm just glad that my computer says 16%.\nMy legs say 26%.\nJust a just a 16% grade to start off the\nday.\nBut 17% like a perfect 16%\nroad to take us to the exact same point.\nOuch. Ouch. All the way out to put in a\npretty way. That would be nice. Yeah.\nWe're going to be finishing here uh this\nsegment where we are right now at the on\nColeman Valley before you drop into the\ncoast. So you get to pause and take in\nthis spectacular\nview. Heat. Heat.\nOnce you catch your breath and roll up\nthe coast and then we go up, we go up\nMyers grade. It's tend generally people\nlike to come down that because of the\nspeed and the view. So, um I love this\ndirection myself. Um and it's little bit\nunknown to some people in terms of even\nif they live out here on um you know lot\nvery few people have even know what\ntheir times are up that. So, it's we're\nwe're mixing it up. And then we end up\non the top of Hower Bridge up by by King\nRage and Tinbar where it's going to end.\nAnd then we get to roll all the way back\nthrough Kazadero and in into back to\nthere just casually with your friends\nchatting. It'll be the end of our\nseries. We'll have brick oven pizza at\nuh at Gold Coast Coffee and uh yeah,\nthat's our event. Alex, you've ridden\nand raced your bike all over the world.\nWhat's it like to ride in Sonoma County?\nOh my goodness. Um a dream come true. Uh\nI actually live in Sonoma County. first\nhouse I've ever owned. So, most of the\nGrasshopper Adventure Series actually\nhappens on my home roads. I think it's\nthe best road riding in the entire\nworld, plus mixed terrain, cuz you never\nknow what's going to hit you at a\nGrasshopper Adventure Series. Even some\nof the pavement, you know, this is a the\none quote unquote road event. But the\nroad is spicy. It's textured. I was\nhappy to have big wide tires on that rub\nand that rub headshock. Yeah, the future\nshock is definitely a game changer here.\nSo, Specialized uh Rubet, I ride this uh\nSpecialized Rub\u00e9 SL8 with 32 millimeter\ntubless tires. Um, and we were talking\nabout it today, but riding uh here I\ncall it the Soma Tapestry. It's just a\nbeautiful asphalt with a bunch of\npatchwork that they didn't finish. Like\na heavy corduroy shag carpet. It's like\nyour grandma's quilt, but it's on\nasphalt.\nClimbs are steep. Like we're pushing 16,\n17, 18%. What's the What's the gearing?\nIt's like a compact crank. The the move\ncompact crank and I'm have a 36 in the\nback. A little party gear there. The\nbike for me is my custom Mosaic\nXT1. Um, which is a cross bike, but it's\nessentially an all-road bike. So, I\nthink an all-road bike with between 30\nmil and 34 mil tires would be fine. Um,\nbut our friend Jav's out here on 28s and\nrim brakes with carbon wheels and you\ncould do that as well. Just bring your\nlegs. I think that's the most that's the\nmost important part is doesn't matter\nwhat bike you bring just as long as you\nhave the legs. Today I rode uh my road\nbike uh with 30s tubeless. There's it's\nmostly all road except cruise that we\nare about to do. Uh but I've done it on\nthe road bike and it's not a bad setup.\nUh it depends on how comfortable you are\nwith uh uh that type of bike, but I do\nlove it and that's why I'm riding it.\nDon't try this at home, kids.\nI think that I saw it. So Miguel, when\nyou started the Grasshoppers 28 years\nago, what was what was the vision? What\nwas the drive? When I started the\nGrasshoppers, you know, I was racing\nregionally as a pro mountain biker. love\nthat experience and the challenge and\neveryone's going their hardest taking\ncare of yourself. But when I travel to\ndo some road races in the threes, uh if\nyou weren't in the in the break, then\nthe rest of the day was just negative.\nLike so you'd travel and people would\njust just sit up and I wanted to to put\nthe put them on the best roads in Sonoma\nCounty, the most challenging things, but\neverybody turning them inside out. And I\nthink that's the thing that we've\nevolved over time. People, it's the\npersonal challenge and then you're\nalways, you know, you're digging deep.\nSo, it's a it's an event where you're\nchallenging yourself personally and with\nyour friends and and it's a huge\naccomplishment if someone's finishing\nfor their their PR or on the podium. And\nI think that we we continue to strive to\ndo that and create a place where people\ncan either be racing for that or, you\nknow, have their best day on the bike.\nAnd often times it's through really,\nreally difficult, challenging, beautiful\nterrain. What are what are some of your\nfavorites here? I know this is like the\nthe the greatest hits, but you know what\nwhat are a couple of your favorite\nfavorite stretches of road on this on\nthis course on this particular one\ntoday? um you know on the ridge on\nColeman Valley dropping down the bo both\nthe views and and just the I don't know\nthe swishiness of the road and you drop\nin unulates like we were talking about\nit's like doing a you know a high blue\nblack diamond mountain bike trail but on\nyour road bike it's got that same\nsineuousness of being on the edge and\nthat best there was like one best line\non these little roads so that's one um\nup along the view up along grade for the\nview of that and then what's not part of\nthe time segment dropping down Fort Ross\nwhich we just did which is kind of a\npucker up descent. Yeah, that was spicy.\nWhat we just did drop into here with I\nmean I like to descend. I like to go\ndownhill and then to be in the trees but\nto be able to get this views like this\nto have it open up. A lot of our events\nwe're in the woods we're in the trees\nwe're in the thick of it and this one\nwe're like trees open trees open ocean.\nSo it keeps like it you know feeling\nfeeling different. Gives perspective you\nknow. Um, I think we'd like that as\ncyclists to be able to just like be in\nnature, have it be quiet, but also be\nable to take a peek around. King Ridge\nis the finale to the 2025 Grasshopper\nAdventure Series. May 10th in Duncan's\nMills, California. If you're in the Bay\nArea, come on up. Give it a crack. If\nyou're elsewhere in the world, check out\nthe Grasshopper series for your 2026\ncalendar. Regardless of whether you're\nable to join us or not, I hope watching\nthis is maybe giving you a bit of\ninspiration to get out there on your\nbike and enjoy the ride."

      "transcript": "why are we here\nwhy not i think it's always a good\ngood question before any big dumb\nadventure\n[Laughter]\ni am ted king\nbicycle rider\nretiree slash current bicycle rider\n[Music]\ndo you remember how wrecked i was yeah\nso you're gonna be less than half of\nthat\nhi me\nuh what was the question how do i feel\nsomeone had recently asked me he said i\nfelt like i've been hit by a car and she\nsaid have you been hit by a car before\nand i said yeah i actually have and this\nfeels much worse\nthanks\nit's a non-stop inventory and it'll\ndrive you crazy\nall right\nso\nsometime in 2020\nwhen people are doing ever ridiculously\nlonger and longer rides amid a pandemic\nwe have\nthe mad genius miguel crawford who says\ni can do something even bigger than that\nhe said i've created the mega hopper we\ngot a thousand feet of climbing per 10\nmiles 430 miles 43 000 feet of climbing\nwhat is the grasshopper adventure series\nuh\nit is the\nog of gravel my first experience was\n2008 i want to say they're they're so\nwell known in northern california and\nand just the history and heritage is\nsomething that has been really really\nspecial to be part of over the years my\nname is miguel crawford i wear a couple\ndifferent hats i teach high school\nspanish i've been teaching for 26 years\nas a teacher i've always had the summers\nand my vacations to go on adventures and\ni just love connecting things and it\nfeels like an artistic endeavor has over\nyears of putting these together and so\nit wasn't simple to think how could we\nconnect all these together where you're\nnot doing loops and i sat down and\nplaying around with where i linked nine\nof the grasshoppers together and so i\nthink i've put 17 different routes\ntogether over the 24 years for the\ngrasshopper all just within northern\ncalifornia\nwe are going to see an absolute bit of\neverything that the area has to offer i\nmean my goal is just to have\nfun over a\nvery long and painful 430 miles\nman i'm like more nervous now than\nbefore the start of here\ni'm gonna go to\nthere you're bed gonna drive\njust start riding bikes\nhere we are 5 45 a.m we are at the mill\ndistrict typically this place is super\nlively because whenever i'm here i'm\nhosting events and really showcasing\nwhat healdsburg\nand the surrounding area is all about\nthat's the whole purpose of this project\nis to show\nshow the landscape show the variety show\nthe adventure that you can have around\nhere and that's why i'm up at 5 45 a.m\nto go for this bike ride\nlet's do it\nit was a perfect start to the day to\nroll out of here and then within a\nhandful of miles already meeting up with\nmiguel i mean he's without question the\ngenesis of this event\nso sun's coming up and\nyou know we're a handful of moments\nwe're just tourists\nyou know there are roads that he's\nwritten\ncountless times that i've written dozens\nof times and we're stopping just being\nlike\nthat is a magnificent landscape as we're\nriding he's talking about\nland that he lived post-college\nearly on in the course and why that's\nimportant to him\nrolling out of wine country here in\nheelsburg\ngoing up over deep into the redwoods\nbeautiful climb\npine flat going out to the coast you\nhave the the absolute landscape of the\nwest coast right there it's it's\nmagnificent first real gravel\nwe're at the watering hole in casadaro\nthis is a famous spot\ni mean chaz came out and\nrode willow creek down coleman valley\nhe's a hoot you obviously get his energy\njust by being within proximity of them\nnow here we are at top of coleman valley\ni'm chaz christensen i live in the bay\narea we are up in northern california in\ngrasshopper territory and this is where\ni got my introduction to gravel and\nadventure writing 10 years ago if you're\nnot prepared this is some of the\ngnarliest riding i think in all of\ncalifornia so doing this route in one go\nthe mega hopper 430 miles 43 000 feet of\nclimbing is gnarly there's a lot of good\naid stations by that i mean bakeries\nthis is a definitely a hefty thing to do\nin one go i would do this\non a four day bike packer and i would\ncamp up on the ridgelines and i would go\neat a hot bakery breakfast every morning\nand i'd probably take four to five days\nso the fact that ted's gonna do it in\nprobably less than 48 hours is uh\nit's a feat kudos to him i'm gonna ride\ndown this hill and then go to the bakery\nand get it\n[Applause]\ncoleman's a roller coaster i'm gonna\nhead this way he's gonna head that way\nall right four and a half riding hours\naveraging 262 watts\nthree and a half more centuries to go\nokay what's my rig\ncannondale super six evo se\nwhich is my gravel bike of choice\nmassive clearance\n700 by 48 c tires in there\nzip 303 fire crest i'm running it mullet\nso i got eagle out back i got a 46\nfront tooth chainring a 1050 rear so i\nmean that is the perfect range for me\napproximately halfway through today day\none we are ahead of average we are well\nover ten thousand feet of climbing the\nnext hundred miles are going to be a\ndoozy but one pedal stroke at a time and\nwe'll make it happen\nand we are going up mount vision\nthis is a vision quest\ncoming out of point reyes do mount\nvision perfect name for the for the\nclimb because you got vision you got a\nview 360 degrees beautiful view from up\nthere\nvision quest\ncomplete\ntop of mount vision that was a\nridiculous three mile climb now i'm\nabout to drop in on some single track\nall the way down see ya\nzip back down to the coast\nand\ninstead of taking the traditional\nhighway one\nmiguel had us bang a right turn and go\nup on a lima valley trail\nsingle track galore\nthose are the kind of trails that are\nperfect for a gravel bike\ni also rode with my\nreally really good friend i mean best\nfriend\ntony little who came out\nmount tam\ni think one thing that makes it really\nspecial is how isolated you can be so\nquickly you've got complete peace and\nquiet tranquility and it's just this\nbeautiful\npiece of san francisco culture mountain\nmolina's rich\ncommence\nsalinas fairfax done\nlet the rubber meet the road we call\nthat soul work do we not and it's free\nfeel free to pedal that one all the way\nthrough\n165 miles and\n18 000 feet of climbing\nbut that is a ferocious ratio\nthe goal in day one was to cover the 205\nmiles and get to occidental because i\nknew upon arrival i'd have a place to\nstay\nand you know gather\na little bit of recuperation for what\nwas going to be in store the next day\nwe're just on our way back from dinner\nand uh\nwhat what was the time i think it's like\n13 pedaling hours 14 pedaling hours\nwhat kind of money do i need to go get\non my bike and go ride 205 miles\nright now\ni don't think money i think i need sleep\nmore than any money right now\nbut i think i'm completely empty knowing\nthey're gonna be able to rest and\nrecharge a little bit before tomorrow\nthis is ted\nsigning off\nand very close to going to bed\nhere we are\nrock on\nit's been now a half dozen years in\nretirement and it's taking on new and\ndifferent things exactly a year ago i\nwas getting ready for the arkansas high\ncountry race that was my first bike\npacking trip that was a thousand miles\nself-supported all over arkansas and so\nthe the mega hoppers it's taken a page\nout of that 430 miles is a considerable\nportion\nof the biggest ride that i've ever done\nit's that element of unknown that just\nis exciting and daunting and terrifying\nand fun all the same time that was\nold casadero\nit's\nnow about to start king ridge\none thing that i really loved about this\nride is i'm riding them\ni'm riding these iconic routes at\ntotally different times of day so to be\nat the top of king ridge at dawn and so\nto see the sunrise was just\nthat's the kind of stuff that makes you\nfeel special on a bike\nyeah i can't help but think of\nmeeting my wife on king ridge\nfor\neasy and obvious reasons but that one is\nspecial among them all\nking ridge\nturn right\ntin barn\nskaggs\nand then a screaming descent\nwhich brings us here to the gate\nto lake sonoma single track\nlake sonoma\ni\ngot off my bike\n40 times i mean i\ncertainly\nstopped trying to count after it was\ntaking place every\nlesson learned if you're gonna ride your\ngravel bike here be gosh darn cherry you\nhave good walking shoes\ncalifornia is a place that i have called\nhome\num obviously living now on the other\nside of the country it's it's it's funny\nto have these sort of two places to feel\nso connected sonoma\nin particular is a place that is is\nintegral in my cycling career it's the\nfirst place i came when i signed my pro\ncontract within the first two weeks of\nmoving to california i was doing my\nfirst hopper i won my first opera there\nplank coffee in cloverdale\nyou know i look back on day two\nthe first part was certainly\ncharacterized by moving really slowly\nand trying to be at peace with the\nfrustration of not moving as quickly as\ni'd like my name is matthew accorino i'm\na chef most of the time cyclist most of\nthe time but i'm here today riding with\nted finishing the second half of his\nepic two-day adventure that he's on but\ni'm a bit of an adventurer myself so i'm\nalways\nup for a good long ride\nsonoma's got\ngreat\nroads if you're riding road bikes you\nknow what happens is\nall these rural communities out here\nthey start building houses and because\nthey build houses then all these little\nfingers of roads go out into places so\nat some point somebody says okay here's\na road goes to here now it's dirt then\nit connects to the other side and then\nit becomes pavement again and so it's\nall this mixed terrain riding\nit's a lot of fun uh it's off the beaten\npath and it's kind of endless and i\nthink for all those reasons\nyou can uh\nhave quite an adventure out here\ni have so much confidence in him because\nwhen he told me he wanted to do this\nride it's like 400 and whatever 30 miles\nwalk in the park for you you've done a\nthousand miles in arkansas you know this\nis just like what he loves to do\nsometimes\nit's a lot easier to sit and watch the\ndot though than it actually is to do the\nride so i forget that like oh this is\nactually a really challenging feat and\nnow seeing him like okay yeah he's\nhe's human he's tired\nthe second part of day two\nin one word is heat\nit was it was stifling\nwe're gonna turn right and then start to\nclimb proper\nit's it's funny meeting up with some\nfolks who have fresh legs because that's\ngonna that's gonna push the pace a\nlittle bit at that point you're just\ntrying to do the final 25 which is a\nequally cruel burn\ni was looking at that ride as as over\nthe course of two 100 mile plus rides\nthose first 100 miles\nfelt like riding my bike threw quicksand\ninto a headwind uphill both ways in a\nsnowstorm\nfrom geysers all the way down\nto the base of spring mountain where you\nfinally get back to civilization\ngetting up over ida clayton same deal i\nmean it's it's big flat hot exposed and\nadequate and has the added benefit of\nbeing foolishly steep\ni'm just reminding myself why i don't\nride ida clayton very often because that\nwas penis\ntwo significant climbs to go\nand hopefully downhill and tailwind\neverywhere else\nit was really nice having\nmiddletown on the other side and knowing\nthere is a heck of a lot of hydration to\nbe had i think i drank\nuh at least three bottles\nsoda\ndrink mix\nmatt has certainly had no expectation\ninto riding into\nthe dark\nso therefore he didn't bring lights in\norder to bring warm clothes conveniently\nthat's a good example of\nover packing just the tiniest bit so i\nhad a vest that we could wear\ni know laura's got some pizza ordered up\nso that sounds pretty dreamy i don't\nknow why we're going home\ni think we should just start over\nand then we became a train because i was\non the front with my headlamp and he\njust had to follow the wheel in front of\nhim\nwhat i love about an adventure like this\nis it's\nit's something that anybody really can\ntake on i mean obviously i'm doing it\nwith this\nfoolish ambition of doing it as quickly\nas possible\nbut this is feasible to drop in and do\ndo sections at a time\nmega hopper\nthat's a wrap\nthis the mega hopper to me represents\nyou know this this really fast growing\nfacet of bike packing\nand it's it's it's almost like i want to\ni want to put this on the map for bike\npackers for people to recognize that you\ncan do so much in this area i want\npeople to see this as a carrot for them\nto chase down for them to go do for them\nto\npursue\n27 hours over the course of\na day and a half\nthat's enough to make me tired\nto all a good night\nspending time in healdsburg while we\nlived in california and now from the\nother

      "description": "This is my experience at the 2022 Huffmaster Grasshopper Adventure Series Bicycle race. One of the longest running mixed terrain \"gravel\" race series in the country, the Grasshopper Adventure Series, is one of my favorite bicycle events. I've been riding \"racing\" these events going as far back as 2006-2007 when I first learned about this crazy alternative to the then popular road racing scene. My first race was on a road bike with 23mm tires. While this event has grown in popularity, it still retains its community focus. Anyone can ride, or race, this event and there are no limits to what bicycle you can use. It's mostly about fun, but there are a few fast riders there looking to take the home a win. \n\n2022 Results:\nhttps://runsignup.com/Race/Results/112590#resultSetId-302796;perpage:100\n\nEvent Organizer Website:\nhttps://grasshopperadventureseries.com/rides/huffmaster-hopper-april-20th/",

in my west valley\nhere at the\ncamping area that was set up for\neveryone to stay if they wanted\nand i'm just going to get ready for this\nrace today\nthe plan is i want to do a\nkind of uh\ninside look at the\nor you know maybe like a behind the\nscenes\nlook at the uh northern california\nmixed terrain bike racing\nscene i want to give you an exclusive\nbehind the scenes look\nuh mixed terrain racing is like gravel\nracing except\nyou're often on anything from paved\nroads to broken paved roads to\ngravel roads to dirt roads to dirt\ntrails to single tracks so there's\nalways something\nthat's mixing it up and making it\ndifferent\nthese are really really interesting bike\nevents and they bring out a really\nunique crowd of people and it's a lot of\nfun so today i'm have i'm excited to\nshare this with all of you so hopefully\nyou'll stick around and\nhey\noh\ni'm going for\ndevoted to flood\ni should get you some of my\nmy marine bottles\nthere we go water bottles\ni came to get you and you were gone i\nwould not look for you out on the road\noh yeah yeah ready for\na gravelly are you ready\nlet's go and see\nit's going to be it's a fast course this\nyear is a lot faster this year than last\nyear in my opinion really\nyeah so it's the same course though but\ndifferent the ending's a little\ndifferent the ending is a little bit\ndifferent and then they rode\ni think because of the rain this year\ncompared to drought last year makes so\nmuch difference a lot a lot of scents\nare stuck in the ground okay\nyeah so this is the new bike this is\nfully custom this is stella and this is\nyour\ndesign paintwork everything\nif i can't say so\nif you can take you can take a little\ncredit\nwell i only have a brain and then when\npeople work\nyou have to give them more of the credit\nbecause if they don't do the work\nyour brain doesn't\nshow\nso what's the uh what's the strategy\ntoday\njust sit\nride and have fun\nokay so you're gonna just take it a\nlittle easier today just sit\nright there and have fun\nno no plans no strategies nothing as\nlong as i'm having fun\nthat's it\nyou know the race is already\ndeciding\nwhat am i going to cheesecake i think\nthere's easier cheesecake at safeway so\nthat will require no effort at all\nall right yeah excellent that's a good\nstrategy sally yep that's the sadly\nstrategy\nthe race is already been decided\nit's time everyone it's now 9 00 a.m and\nwe are getting ready to roll out for\nthis 2022 huffmaster\ngrasshopper mixed terrain bicycle race\nand this first group of riders this is\nthe pro men and women's field\nthe organizer of the race decided to\nsplit us up into age group categories\nfor safety reasons the start of this\ncourse is mostly flat and the roads are\nopen to traffic\nand so the decision was made to kind of\nbreak the groups up into smaller\ninto smaller sizes\nin order to hopefully make it safer for\neveryone involved\nso now that the other groups have gone\nit is my turn here this is the 40 to 49\nyear old group and i'm going to find a\nspot here somewhere in the middle\ntowards the back of this uh of this\ngroup\nthere were about a hundred writers\nregistered in my age group\nand i would say about 80 to 85 showed up\nfor the race today\nand as you can see we are rolling out\nonto these first 35 miles of\nagricultural roads\ngenerally riding north west the roads\ndo\ngo from pavement to gravel and back to\npavement in a few sections\nand the important point part to pay\nattention to here is that you get\nyourself in a good position so you don't\nget caught out in a crosswind\ni use this time to move around a little\nbit within the group and to\nsay hello to some of my friends who i\nhaven't seen in a while\nand also just to find a good position\nfor\nlater in the race\nafter this section of road we turn on to\nhighway 162\nand then on to the 306 road which takes\nyou to an area called elk creek\nhaving a good time well so far so good\nalmost got dropped right there\nfrom there you begin the first real\nclimb of the day which is a gravel climb\nand uh it goes up to about\ni would say\n1500 feet or so\nbefore descending down a very steep\ntechnical descent\nonto more gravel roads and a few more\ngravel\nclimb some rollers once you're over\nthose rollers you do find yourself back\nonto a paved descent\nall right here's a uh\nmid race\ncheck in\nuh we are about halfway through the race\nright now\nand i don't know if you can hear me\nbecause we're going uh kind of fast here\npretty fast pretty fast here i know i'm\non this paved road\nslight downhill\nbut my rear tire\nhas been slowly leaking down\nand i'm trying to decide when\nto stop and air it up a little bit\nit's getting real low\nshould be coming up on a rest\nstop soon hopefully\nso i want to use that as the chance to\ntear up the tire a little bit\nmid-right check in\nover and out\non that paved section of road i found\nmyself\ngrouped in with these really strong\nriders and we worked together really\nwell there were three or four riders in\nthis group that were really strong and\nreally motivated to get us to this\nnext gravel section of the course\nwe stuck together here all the way until\nthe second rest stop where i ended up\ngetting split off of this group to try\nand fix my leaky\nback\ntire\nwhich meant i needed to climb the final\nhuffmaster climb alone\ndo the descent alone which was actually\ngood for me i prefer to descend\nalone if possible just to avoid\nyou know getting tangled up with other\nriders\nall right well that was the huff master\nclimb and now we're on the huffmaster\ndescent\ni'd say we're about 25 miles from the\nfinish now\ntime to descend\nafter that huffmaster descent i\nregrouped again with two more riders\nand we worked together really well that\nwas probably about the hardest effort i\nwrote of the day was that final gravel\nsection before turning on to the\nmaxwell sites paved road\nand that's a wrap\ngot some guys back here that uh\n[Music]\nyo\nrichard\ncan you tell i uh\ncan you tell i just finished doing a\ngravel race\num\nbut\nthat was a tough ride\ni'm uploading my strava right now so\nthat i can see what the uh the not the\nnumbers are\nso for me it was uh 90 miles\nnot 95 like it was\ntwo years ago when i did it i'll have to\nget the official time\nbecause i started this before\nbefore the race started so i'll have to\nlook at that but\nwhat\na\nride let me see if there's any segments\non here\ndid pr on huffmaster climb\nthe uh the conditions were just perfect\nthe the it was it's been dry for weeks\nthe dirt\nor gravel was basically\nsmooth like\nfelt like pavement in some spots\nall right well\nnow we got to change and go over and uh\ncheck out the party\nall right let's take a quick look at the\nresults of this race and that will\nconclude\nthis year's grasshopper adventure series\nhuffmaster for 2022.\nso in first place in the pro men\nthe winner\nfor a time of four hours and 10 minutes\nis brennan\nwurtz\nfollowed by sandy florin and then skyler\ntaylor congratulations gentlemen\nfor the pro\nwomen\nthat is the pro women long

      "description": "The Old Caz Grasshopper is a premiere bike adventure ride taking place each year in January, and starting in the Northern California town of Occidental. It's now in its 20th year, and only getting stronger. This years event bought in over 600 cyclists eager to take to the back roads of West Sonoma County. This adventure ride/race is difficult to classify. Is it a training ride, a race, or just an awesome adventure? Maybe it's all of the above, I think so, but no matter what, it brings out some of the best amateur and professional cyclist's from the area with the same goal in mind, go fast and have fun. As any have pointed out there is no perfect bike choice for this ride with the old standing motto still holding true \"ride what you bring.\" This year, I rode a hardtail mountain bike with oversized road tires. Last year (2017) I rode a road bike with 28mm slicks. No matter what I ride, I still get about the same time, providing I don't get any flats. I hope you enjoy my race day break-down and please stick around till the end where I will discuss possible ways I might improve on my time next year, this could benefit you too!\n\nA link to the race page and results:\nhttp://grasshopperadventureseries.com/rides/old-caz/",

      "transcript": "Today I am going to be doing a quick\nrace report for the old Cazadero\nGrasshopper which I competed in over the\nweekend. As some of you may know, I\nprepared a few short videos leading up\nto the event and I'll post a few cards\nhere at the top of your screen. Please\nstick around to the end of this video.\nThat's where I offer some tips and\nadvice on what I could have done\ndifferently to improve my time overall.\n[Music]\ngot a passion here. Oh shoot, you left\non to me.\nSo, in today's video, I'm going to treat\nthis kind of like a race report. I know\nI've said in the previous videos that\nI've made leading up to this that it's\nnot really a bike race, but\nthe reality is it is ridden like a bike\nrace. And you have for the most part\nbike racers who show up to do this event\nleading up to the actual ride. I\nproduced a couple videos showing the\ncreek crossing and also some of the\nupgrades I was making to this bike. But\nwhat I left out was what tire choice I\nwas making. That decision to leave that\nout was unintentional. I wanted to get a\nfeel for how wet the roads were going to\nbe and how wet the trails were going to\nbe or how wet they would still be after\nall the rain we had. So the tire I chose\nwas this is the Compass Snowquali Pass.\nI used the standard weight casing and it\nis a 44 mm wide tire. So, I have never\nactually used the bigger ones, but I was\nvery curious to what they're able to\nprovide in terms of ride quality,\nrolling resistance, and all that. And\neverything that I have read uh indicated\nto me that these were probably a pretty\nfast rolling tire, aside from the fact\nthat they're also very light compared to\nother XC or crosscountry tires that you\nwould find on a hard tail mountain bike.\nI'm not saying this is the best bike to\nride for this event, but between the\nbikes that I had, I found that this one\nwas my most my best compromise. So, the\npressure that I used for the day of the\nevent was 40 PSI in the back and 35 in\nthe front. I do feel in looking back now\nafter the results of the race that that\nwas an a pretty ideal tire pressure to\nchoose for my weight and for the weight\nof the bike and the conditions of the\nroads. The next thing we'll do, we'll\njust get into this Strava flyby. We'll\nwe'll take a look at that. I'm going to\nshow you some of the key points in the\nrace or where things actually um made a\ndifference, where the key moments were.\nYou should see this uh Strava flyby now\non your screen. And I'm going to go\nahead and There was a lot of people at\nthis ride that posted their rides to\nStrava. So, I can't show all of them,\nbut I want to I went through the list\nhere and I pulled out a few people who\nwere near me throughout most of the\nrace. So, I've checked on their names. I\nchecked everyone else off and I checked\non their names, but also uh I want to\ncheck on the the winner, which was Ted\nKing. Congratulations,\nTed. Good job, by the way. U very um\nimpressive ride. Okay, so I checked on\nLevi Liipheimer, which I think most of\nyou know who that is. Uh and then also\nI've checked on Ted King, cuz I just\nwant to show you, you know, how the race\nis on the front versus where I'm at from\nthe very start. Uh I showed I'll show\nyou some footage at the start line, but\nbut basically uh where I started was\nsomewhere in the the middle of the\ngroup, maybe maybe just slightly to the\nback of the middle. So maybe at the 60%\nmark. I I didn't really line up uh at a\nquick time. I was I was sort of\ngetting ready and I was doing a little\nwarm up on Coleman Valley Road and I\nkind of pushed it up to the line.\nAlthough I was there early and I had\nplenty of time to line up. So that\nmorning I wasn't feeling real motivated\nto take a lot of footage and I also\nwasn't in the mood to like force my way\nup onto the front. Like I just didn't\nfeel like I had like I didn't feel like\nI was really going to do all that well\nanyway. So I didn't want to like get in\nthe way and have everybody having to\nmove around me. So again, that was just\na lack of confidence. I should have, you\nknow, in hindsight, I should have went\nahead and positioned myself kind of\nwhere I think I fit um overall in the\ngroup. But anyway, let's talk about the\nstart. So, as it always does, it rolls\nout from the town. People are um more or\nless in one big group. And this year was\n600 plus riders. It was the biggest\nturnout ever. And that was definitely\nnoticeable in town in the town of\nAccidental. There was just a lot of\nriders. So, so anyway, we rolled out.\nSo, that's a key to doing well at these\nrides is to try to get a good starting\nposition.\nI'm kind of at the back of this this\ngroup of people. And these are the\npeople I ultimately will be riding with\nin the, you know, subsequent part of the\nrace. Uh there's a whole bunch of people\nbehind me, which I don't have on here,\nbut uh so anyway, I get out to the\nhighway and we take the highway all the\nway to Duncan's Mills. As we come up to\nMontero, we cross the bridge there at\nthe river and we work our way towards\nthe next climb, which is Old Monoro\nRoad. And that ride, that road is uh\nthat climb's short. It's like maybe less\nthan 600 feet. It's a short climb, but\nthen it's a dirt descent.\ndown to Cherry Cherry Street or Cherry\nDrive in Gernville. And that's the road\nthat takes you over to Old Casadero,\nwhich is where the next big climb is. In\nfact, it's I think one of the biggest\nclimbs with the exception of the final\nclimb. So, it's comparable to the last\nclimb. So, we get to the top. I do the\ndescent down to the creek crossing here.\nImmediately across the creek, there's\nactually another little climb. And I\nthink a lot of people forget about that\nclimb. It's on a gravel road, so it's uh\nit's smooth, but actually not really\nbecause the gravel on that road is\nloose. It was wet, so it was helpful to\nkind of it helped to keep it packed, but\nI've ridden that on days where it's\nreally dry and it's just very loose\ngravel. So, we drop down this last\nlittle pavement deset to the town of\nKazadero. And let me zoom in here\nbecause this is where things actually\nturn for me in this ride. So I get into\nCadero and uh I know it looks like I'm\nwith a group here, but let's get in\ncloser. So I am where the post office\nis. I'm there by myself. There's this\ngirl behind me, her name is Amit. And so\nI'm riding through town and as I get to\nwhere the store is, just past the store,\nAmit comes up and she just flies by me.\nIt was like I felt like she was going\ntwice my speed. I see her passing me and\nI take a quick look and I make a quick\nassessment that I need to jump on this\nwheel. If I can sit on her wheel for a\nlittle bit, I can maybe regroup with the\nnext group up ahead. And and you know,\nmaybe that's her strategy. There was\nanother female cyclist that we passed.\nShe gets on our group, our little group\nalso. So now there's three of us and uh\nwe're we're all basically trying to work\ntogether. I'm trying to participate in\nthe in the in the effort, but I know\nthat um you know, I can't pull like this\ngirl is. Yeah, she was uh something\nelse. So, anyway, I was really thankful\nthat she picked me up and uh I was able\nto follow her. So, we worked for about 3\nmiles. There was the three of us. We\nturned on to what's called Austin Creek\nRoad, which gets us off the highway. It\noccurs right here. We're now on this\nlittle side road, which is rougher and\nrolling terrain. Um, it causes us to\nslow down a little bit, but we've re\nwe've we join with another big group of\ncyclists\nwho then work together all the way to um\nDuncan's Mills. Let's get Now, there's a\nlittle climb here and we've been all\nkind of sharing the work, pulling and\ntrying to get some time back. We get to\nthis little climb and I think our group\nthat had turned into about 12 to 15\nsuddenly dwindled again here. And we\nlost a few people on this little climb.\nAnd I think we were down to maybe four\nor five when we turned on to Willow\nCreek Road right there. That's us\nturning on Willow Creek Road. And uh\nthere was about four of us. Amity being\nthe one sort of pulling the whole time.\nSo, she drives us all the way up Willow\nCreek Road just about to the start of\nthe climb, which is right right here.\nLet's get to the start of the climb. So,\num, oh, by the way, that's Levi and Ted.\nThey're they're at they're now. So,\nwe're just turning. If you can see all\nthis. So, at this moment when Levi and\nTed are starting the final climb, we\naren't even on Willow Creek Road yet.\nSo, that's how far ahead Levi and Ted\nwere. This is where it got interesting.\nI felt like I had just I had overdone\nit. So, I start the climb. Normally, I\ncan do this climb in 20 22 minutes, but\nyou can see here Amites of the green\ncircle. She's just slowly riding away\nfrom me now. and I just try to maintain\nmy losses. I got passed by several\npeople here, guys that I think were\nbehind me in a different group. Um, but\nuh, Amit just rode away and I just tried\nto cover my losses, do the best I could,\nnot go too slow, but I felt like I was\njust like I could have walked faster.\nOkay, the finish is right there.\nI am done. The key moments were after\nthe creek crossing in Kazadero and\nhaving and finding a strong group to\nride with. Let's go ahead and take a\nlook at the results. This is the overall\nand this is the I have the filter set\nhere to all. So Ted King finished the\nride in 2 hours 50 minutes 59.7 seconds\nfor a first place win.\nSecond place was Cameron Bronstein and\nthen in third was Sam Betetti.\nCongratulations, guys.\nIncredible results and incredible\nincredible um times that you posted\ntoday. Uh, Levi ended up in fourth place\noverall, followed by Phillip, Ryan Ren,\nAndrew Gosling, Anthony Little, Steven\nVogle, Carson Benjamin, Jackson Duncan,\nChaz Christensen, Craig Fellers, Will\nRifle Mocker, John Hunt, Kate\nCourtourtney was the first place women's\nfinisher. Uh, she finished 16th overall.\nThat's with everyone combined at a\nblistering time of 3 hours and 5\nminutes. As I scroll through here, most\nof these are recognizable names. There\nare some unfamiliar names. Um, but most\nof them do I do recognize and I'm sure\nI'm sure some of you do. Yuri's a\nwell-known cyclist. I think he won the\nDirty Kza one year. Mig is Mig Crawford.\nObviously, he puts on this event each\nyear. Thanks, Mig. Good job, man. And\nlook at your time. 3 hours 15. Okay, so\num not to don't mean to skip ahead all\nthese people. So here's Amit. Uh so she\nfinished in three hours 25 minutes.\nOkay, I ended up I'll go ahead and show\nyou where I'm at here. Uh here's me,\nJeremy Stanley. I don't know if you knew\nthat, but uh I did it in 3 hours 30\nminutes. All right, so now let's look at\nit by by uh group. So from the we'll\nstart with the pros. So, obviously Ted\nKing, all the same people are pretty\nmuch in the same order. Let's look at\nthe um we'll look at my category. Men 40\nto 49.\nThere were\nuh let's see, Matt Young finished first\nin my age group, followed by Matt Adams\nand Peter Vaughn. I ended up 35th\noverall in my age group. All right. So,\nthe last thing I wanted to talk about\nwas the things that I could do or see\ndoing to improve my results next time.\nUm, I think the bike choice could be\nmade a a little bit better. I believe\nthat a a cyclross or gravel adventure\nbike is the ideal choice because the\ncourse while it is technical, the\nterrain is varied but mostly asphalt.\nSo, I think a lighter weight bike would\ngive you that advantage with the climbs\non the pavement climbs as well as um the\nflatter sections of the ride where\nyou're on highways. I think a gravel\nbike would be the ultimate. There's no\nreal reason to have a front suspension.\nCarrying that extra weight doesn't give\nyou that much of an advantage for the\nweight penalty. Getting a good position\nat the start line. I think that's key.\nAnd then, of course, tire selection. I\ndon't think I could have chosen a better\ntire. Okay, so the last thing I want to\nbring up was just my gear choice.\nI bought this bike back in 2009. It came\nwith a triple front chain ring. That was\nthe sort of the standard at the time. I\nknow since then we've gone to this more\npeople have been going to this one by\nsetup. I haven't gotten on that\nbandwagon yet. I tend to wait and see\nhow these things these trends sort of\nshake out in the end. I'm not convinced\nmyself that the one by is the the best\nsituation. Uh I still have my\nreservations about it. Uh we can spare\nthat for another time. But but basically\nI used the triple front and I was really\nhappy I did because with the big ring\nhelped me on the flat highway sections\nand then of course the middle and small\nrings helped me get up some of the\nclimbs and especially some of the\nsteeper climbs, the steeper parts of the\nclimbs using that small ring in the dirt\nwas very helpful. So overall I'm happy\nwith the gear choice I made. I'm happy\nthe way the bike is geared and I don't\nplan on changing to one by anytime soon.\nThank you for watching and feel free to\nleave a comment and let me know if you\nwere out there and and how your day went\nand uh if there's anything you can add\nto this discussion as far as um what\nrides you're doing in the future or what\ntires you use. That's always\ninteresting. Let me know uh what you\nthink of uh the Grasshopper series. I\nthink it's a lot of fun and uh I highly\nrecommend it."
