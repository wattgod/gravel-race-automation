      "transcript": "Grassroots gravel in Southern Colorado\nhas something for everyone whether\nyou're looking to do your first ever\ngravel event or really challenge\nyourself against some Stout competitors\nand some steep climbs today I'm out here\nriding the course with race director\nAdam Davidson and some friends and we're\ngoing to show you all the good times and\nbeautiful scenery you are in for if you\ncome down to pelo Colorado for the race\non October 12\nin this video we're going to walk you\nthrough the different courses the\nsurfaces some Tire recommendations and\nwhat you can look forward to when you\ncome to race Grassroots gravel in P\nColorado on October 12th and yes I'm\nRuning the brand new 13-speed Shram AIS\nExplorer gravel group you can find all\nthe details and my opinions about that\nin the link above but as pertains to\nthis course I very much appreciated\nhaving the wide range cassette the\n1046 with a 4 to chain ring point is if\nyou're doing the long course you're\ngoing to appreciate having some low low\ngears that 12 mile climb goes on for\nindeed many miles and you're climbing\nmore than 3,000 ft on that one climb\nalone so when the climb heads over\ndouble digits I appreciate having low\ngears while many events lean into the\npro side of racing that is not the focus\nof Grassroots grabble of course fast\npeople are welcome here but the main\nthrust of the event is everyday folks\nwhether you're from peblo or anywhere\nelse around the country or the world if\nyou have a bike want to challenge\nyourself on\ngravel Adam and his crew are happy to\nwelcome you to the roads around peblo\nthe courses at Grassroots gravel um\nwe've got a 15 a 40 a 75 and 110 which\nactually we are standing at the summit\nof the course right now and the 15 and\n40 are are both out and back rolling\ncourses that uh are actually one of my\nfavorite local rides it's what we ride\nevery single week in the red Creek rally\nand they're uh it's a slow climb uh on\nkind of what we're looking at right here\nyou know there's no crazy technical\ngravel on any of that on any of our\ncourses for that matter and\nuh yeah the 15 turns around at the top\nof red Creek Springs which is our weekly\nclassic warm-up and then the 40 turns\naround at Red creek volunteer fire and\nrescue the 15mi course is the start of\nour weekly ride and last year you know\nwe had a whole spectrum of folks riding\nthat thing from people that were just\nlooking for fewer miles to uh folks\nriding with their kids we had people all\nthe way down to uh 10 I'm almost certain\nriding the 15 uh with their dad which\nwas U you know really cool to see that\nenergy out there with folks just having\na good time and also pushing through you\nknow as uh as we all find our challenge\nout in the course and so uh yeah that\nwas really neat to see and something\nthat I feel comfortable saying the 15 is\na approachable challenge for every level\nand age um that is comfortable riding on\nsome dirt our 75 mile course that one uh\nuses the same the same route as the 15\nand the 40 but keeps going and comes and\ndrops down into the Bula Valley and\nthat's the point where the air cools\ndown you're surrounded by ponderosas and\nyou can smell them and you could just do\na quick dip into the valley and then\nclimb back out and then roll back into\ntown on burntmill road and that is fast\nrollers uh across some of the you're\ngoing to pass some of the oldest ranches\nin Colorado right there which I think is\nreally cool\nthe 75m route and the 110 for that\nmatter finish through stem Beach which\nis a natural area that's owned by evz\nRocky Mountain steel and they are\npartnering with us to provide access to\nthat for this one day only of the year\notherwise you cannot go through there\nit's this gorgeous Gravel Road that\nyou've got a straight away between two\nbig ponds and the Finish flags are right\nat the end of that and that's the timing\nfinish and so once you know you have\nyour Sprint against your best bud or\nyour new buds or your biggest competitor\nyou then get to relax and cruise back\ninto town to downtown in fuel and iron\nthe 110 M course also known as the hole\nand if anyone is\nwondering what is the deal with the half\nand the whole for the two longer courses\nweblo Colorado has this uh very Hefty\ndelicacy known as a slopper which is a\nbig old\ncheeseburger with peblo green chili\npoured on top of it usually served in a\nbowl and when you go to a place they'll\nusually ask you like do you want the\nhalf or do you want the whole there's\nthere's a bunch of them and I won't get\ninto the debate on who who is the\nslopper place but if you were to go\nsomewhere and order a half and you know\na pint of Coors or something they will\nknow what you're talking about and and\nso that's that's uh that's the that's\nwhy it's the half in the hole the 110\nthe whole\nslopper that is the uh it's it's one of\nmy favorite routes to ride period\nbecause you get a full sampling of this\nregion you know you're starting downtown\nso you get to see pbl's Historic\ndowntown you're riding through the high\ndesert Past Lake Pueblo State Park and\nthen you come up into the Bula Valley\nand the wet mountains and you get to do\nwhat is one of my favorite segments ever\nwhich is 12 M and 12 Mile which is where\nwe're standing right now at the Summit\nis a 3,400 ft climb and 11 1/2 miles and\nit is beautiful and it it it will\nconstantly remind you that it is 3,400\nft of climbing and uh I love it because\nthe the gravel itself is never too\ntechnical but the hill itself and the\nthe grade is constantly varied through\nthe whole thing so like you feel like\nyou're done and then you're not or you\nfeel like you're getting a break and\nmaybe you do but you never really know\nunless you know this hill really well\nand even on our course preview today I\ncould have sworn that the spot that we\nwere meeting up was just around the\ncorner and I was\nwrong so uh you know once you get here\nto the summit um you still have about a\nmile mile and a half of just pure\ndescent down to Highway 165 and at that\npoint you are home free for a minute or\nat least you get a breather and um after\nriding 165 for a second you're going to\ndrop on to Old San Isabel road which is\na kind of more intimate a little bit\ntighter cornered the trees create a\nlittle bit more of a tunnel than 12 Mile\nand I love it for that because it's like\na different flavor it's almost like a\nmore uh\nrustic Gravel Road even though again the\ngravel's Never Too chunky\nit's when you're going to get some shade\nand it's also where the folks that like\nto descend uh and and you know are able\nto stay responsible in the\ncorners can can differentiate themselves\nfrom other Riders uh that being said the\nrace will probably be one on 12 Mile in\nmy opinion descending descending Old St\nIsabel road is a treat because it's\nreally tight and and the Aspens are\nright there up over for you and uh it's\nreally winding and so it's a fun descent\nafter you finish the old s Isabel\ndescent you're going to hit an aid\nstation it's probably going to be right\nwhen you want it because you will have\njust climbed 12 Mile and done A rad\ndescent and you're ready for a snack and\nafter that you are now kind of just\nentering the world of rolling smooth and\nfast gravel uh with the the wet\nmountains as your backdrop and a whole\nbunch of historic ranches surrounding\nyou the 110 finishes uh on the same roof\nas the 75 finish so you're going to be\ngoing past uh you know agricultural land\nand um coming through the stem Beach\nNatural Area and again that one has one\nof my favorite finishes and I really\npushed to get us that partnership with\nevz Rocky Mountain steel because it is\njust this awesome tenth of a mile razor\nstraight gravel Causeway between these\ntwo ponds and the Finish flags are there\nand then you you your timing stops\nhopefully at A rad Sprint and then you\nCruise back into town to fuel and\n[Music]\niron this course in particular is\nespecially fat fast the gravel is very\nCompact and rolls really well you can\nget away with almost any tire out there\neven a large Road tire which is a lot of\nfun um you go a lot faster on the\ndescents the bigger tire you run and you\ngo a lot faster on the climbs the\nsmaller Tire you run and so you kind of\nget to pick your poison I'm a pretty big\nfan of the 40 semi slick in almost all\nconditions and that's basically what I\nhave on all my bikes the cool thing\nabout Southern Colorado is we get this\nreally great mix of high desert mix with\nalpine and so we get a little more of an\naid climate that you you see around um\nBoulder and Denver um you get really\nthis kind of feel similar to parts of\nNorthern New Mexico we get cactus mixed\nwith um Aspen which is really special we\nget a really great mixture of animals I\nwould be very surprised if you didn't\nsee um Pronghorn or analou out here as\nwell as some really large jack rabbits\nand I don't know I love all of my little\nanimal friends that I see out on the\nPrairies when I'm riding in this part of\nColorado I I will be riding and\nexhibiting I think last year I did the\n40 mile and attempted to do it as fast\nas possible to race back and set up a\nbooth and I think I'm going to do\nexactly the same thing this year is try\nto do the 40 mile a little bit faster\nand race back and set up a booth again\nhow did the racing play out last year\nyou got the win congrats on that how' it\ngo thanks yeah it went great um the\nracing was pretty quick the gravel here\nis very fast the group uh broke off\naround mile 20 just three of us and then\nit broke off to just two of us Michael\ncaner and I a local Rider from Fort\nCollins and we battled up 12 mile\ntogether pretty much the whole way I\ncould see him the whole way and then we\nrode\nsolo mono Mano all the way back to peblo\nit's a long way back it's a long way\nback it was a it was a very long uh\nindividual time trial back to peblo but\nit was lovely I could just get in my\nzone and enjoy the course so for people\nlooking for a fast time what would you\nrecommend and terms of tires or Wheels\nyeah I think uh in Broad Strokes you\nknow yeah a slick Tire would be good but\nuh ride whatever you feel comfortable\nbut slicks I would\nrecommend honestly a 40 or 42 just\nbecause there are some washboard on the\ncourse and you just want to stay focused\non uh staying safe but I think a 40 and\na 42 slick would be perfect I'm going to\nI will run like a 42 42 Pathfinder and\none final question your honor what's\nwhat's the postrace meal of\nchoice postrace meal of choice is\nprobably some uh over here in Southern\nColorado so probably some something to\ndo with uh green chili you know and I\nalso need a couple beers after the race\nyou know welld deserved beers after the\nrace you'll be able to find both of\nthose quite easily yeah I think so I\nthink so all right thanks thanks for\nriding today yeah thank you awes so how\ndid you Lauren how did you get into\nriding gravel bikes um well I kind of\ngot into it um with the Grassroots\ngravel the red Creek rally ride I bought\na gravel bike and went on the rides and\njust loved it I loved the less traffic I\nloved being able to ride in the\nmountains um the community of gravel is\njust wonderful and um in Pablo and uh\nwith Grassroots they've created such a\nwonderful Community here where it's very\nwelcoming to all types of writers and so\nuh it's just kind of flourished from\nthere what would you say to folks who\ninterested but maybe a little\nintimidated about the surface or the\ndistance man this is such a welcoming\nCommunity say like know your body know\nyour bike but push yourself what a great\nplace to push yourself is is this event\nbecause it's very supportive the aid\nstations were wonderful everyone was so\nkind and uplifting and um you know you\ntry something new you're always\nsurprised about what you can accomplish\nfor sure and then where are we now what\nwhat's the backdrop what is this what's\nbehind us okay we're at Lake San Isabel\nwhich is a beautiful spot here in uh Ry\nColorado this like spot is like very\nkind of special to me um I grew up like\nfishing hiking camping this area and so\nto be able to like ride my gravel bike I\nmean like that's incredible coming down\num the highway here I was like looking\nat all the wild flowers and seeing like\nit's just so amazing to get to recreate\nin the Southern Colorado Mountains for\nsure\nn\nbut of course you don't need the latest\nand greatest to do this event or any\nother as long as you've got a bike in\ngood working order and a helmet on your\nhead you are good to go and yes having\nwider gravel tires set it a lower softer\npressure will feel good and I think\nhaving lower gears to help you up the\nSteep climbs will o help but really any\nbike is fine and if you have to get off\nand walk get off and walk I appreciate\nlooking at the names and results in ages\nof the events from last year where I was\nseeing everything from kids younger than\nteenagers all the way up to a gentleman\nin his 70s out here getting after it\nwhen I got into town yesterday afternoon\nI enjoyed cruising around a bit on the\nbike going through City Park popping\ndown to the river trail a lot of\nfamilies out there enjoying the water on\nall sorts of craft after we wrap up here\nI'm going to head over to fuel and iron\nFood Hall check out some of the options\nthere top off before hit the road\nGrassroots gravel down here in peblo\nColorado the day before the event\nthere's a few ShakeOut rides we got\nMarlin bonky from all bodies on bikes\nleading ride we've got Eric from\nAlbuquerque my hometown leading a pedal\nhomies community dad ride hope to see\nyou guys down here for Grassroots gravel\nOctober 12th in PUO Colorado"

      "transcript": "Grassroots gravel P Colorado 110 miles\nlet's get into\n[Music]\nit\nyikes let's get him before we get into\nthe race talk I do need to tell you how\nI was feeling leading up to this day\ntoday we are it's Wednesday so 3 days\nout pretty\nsick hopefully get over this cold or\nwhatever this is because I did come down\nwith a cold or a flu or something and I\nwas really hoping to recover from this\nsickness that lingered in my body before\nrace day but unfortunately that's just\nnot how the cookie\ncrumbled\n[Applause]\nI could drop out of the race and let my\nbody recover seeing as a 110 mile effort\nwas probably not the best thing for it\nthe thing is last year I had signed up\nto new gravel Locos around this time\nwhich was also an event in Pablo\nColorado if you guys have been following\nthe channel for some time you would know\nthat I had to drop as I had developed\nproblems in my left knee problems I\nwasn't really looking to play with this\nyear however I felt fine physically well\nkind of so I was not going to let that\nruin another full day of bike riding I\ndid say well if all else fails and I\nfeel like crap once I start I could just\ndnf and be okay with that this feels\nlike a great point in the video to\nmention that I hadn't been going on Long\nrides since like summer and even those\nwere not quote unquote long rides being\n40 m on average literally my my last\nlong ride was in Wisconsin and it was 30\nmi in July but I did feel like I was\ngood on the bike and in good physical\nshape so I was going to call this the\nthree-month taper on race day I lubed up\nmy body with liquid IVs like seriously I\nprobably had about 10 of them in the 24\nhours surrounding race day I cooked some\neggs for fuel and hit the\nroad yeah he's my manager at Giant the\nrace started and ended in one of\nPueblo's new establishments called Fuel\nand iron which has a good amount of food\nand offerings for everyone so I enjoyed\nthis particular start and finish Zone\nthis being downtown peblo the field had\nto cross town and to not make it a\nversion of monster track but in Colorado\nthe first four miles were neutral and\nthe last I think six miles of the race\nwere also neutral\nonce everyone could see the start line\nthe pace picked up this was quite a\nfunny start as people including myself\npicked up speed to hit the start fast\nand were immediately met by\nwashboard yikes\nyeah this is kind of the point of the\nday where you start asking questions\nwhat race are you doing what time do you\nexpect to do it in you ask these\nquestions not to find your competitors\nbut to find people to ride with going\ninto this race I thought I would be\nhappy with a sub 10 hour finish\nespecially knowing the way I was feeling\nhowever the Four Mile intro had me\nfeeling good and ready to test my Pace\nout without blowing up so at this point\nI was hoping for right around 8 hours I\nfigured I could ride with people trying\nto bag sub n or 8 Hour finishes and that\nwould set myself up to achieve my goal\nMatt who is the rider in the blue with\nthe white uzwi pack was going for sub\neight hours so I decided I would try to\nwork with him for a while at the start\nof the race now I had unintentionally\nworked my way up a bit from him but he\ngladly asked me to hop on the train on\nthis downhill Road\nsection\ntime I know right but with my first stop\nI lost Matt his plan was to not stop at\nany eight station to reach his goal of\nsub eight my goal while important was\nnot going to keep me from stopping at\neight stations for all the tasty snacks\nor lack of snacks more like power juice\nwhile I had stocked up on Cliff Bars\nwhich are usually my go-to on Long rides\nor big efforts I felt on race day they\nwere a struggle to put down I think it\nwas the sickness and having an irritated\nthroat but I just couldn't put down one\nper hour which is what I usually do\nwhich led me to the super Juice flow\nformulas every aid station was well\nstocked up with flow this was my first\ntime trying flow formulas and\nessentially it's like legal doping it's\na drink mix that has all the\ncarbohydrates and electrolytes you would\nwant to keep you from bonking and boy\nwas this stuff gold I know many people\nsay don't try something new on race day\nbut I was already all in I couldn't put\ndown any more Cliff Bars and had to risk\nit if I wanted to stay in this thing\nflow formulas saved my day now this is\nnot a sponsored video by the way but\nwould definitely be open to working with\nthem in the future as they are a\nColorado company anyway Matt would work\nhis way up and I would work my way to\nfind new riding\nbuddies stopped at my first aid station\nabout 18 miles in filled up with\nflow so all stocked up here comes the\nbig climb this is Adam and I would work\nwith him and a bunch of other riders for\nabout 12 miles before the Riders doing\nthe half would eventually turn around to\nhead back to the\nstart you said you were dropping the\npace back there had an out sauce started\nfeeling spicy you know yeah going to\nregret it in like 15\nminutes job Adam\nI took a turn pulling for the group and\nworked my way into eight station number\ntwo for me here I would fill up one of\nmy bottles with flow to have two full\nbottles before the 12 Mile Road Climb by\nthe way huge shout out to all the\nvolunteers at the eight stations they\nwere Beyond friendly and would hold your\nbike for you fill up bottles and just be\noverall very supportive it seriously\nfelt like I had a family of my own out\nthere crewing for me and helping me out\nso thank\nyou get thank\nyou thank\nyou heck yeah thanks for the support and\nI hope you're enjoying this\nvideo in and out of that aid station at\nMile\n34 which is nice I'm not taking too long\nthis is getting so beautiful\nhere we go this is the big climb of the\ncourse so around mile 34 the 110 M\ncourse took you up 12m road which climbs\nabout 3,000 ft and under 10 miles this\nwas the biggest effort on the course and\nI appreciated it being more towards the\nbeginning of the race and not towards\nthe end I didn't get much footage of\nthis\nbecause brutal I did however manage to\ncatch up to Matt even if it was just for\na\nbit hey\nMatt what's\nup\nthis climb\nsucks got about a mile and a half left\nof it I'm ready to get it done after the\nclimb you do get rewarded with some nice\ngravel switchbacks and a major road\ndescent this is where I met\nDallas baby oh my gosh man oh man that\nfeels so good to get it done with\ngosh oh my\nGod\nafter passing Lake Isabelle we had a\nlittle bit of a road climb and then the\ncourse put you through an amazing gravel\ndescent this was probably my favorite\npart of the course I was very careful\ncornering though as I was running old\nWTB byways and it felt like I would\nslide out at any moment but besides the\ngravel descents I do feel like these\ntires were a pretty good choice for the\ncourse as there's a lot of Road sections\nand hard pack\ngravel\noh was\nsick\nhowy\nyeah you want to flow in them or yes\nplease flow thank you very\nmuch shortly after a Station 3 I was\nstarting to feel the ride in my legs it\nwas about mile 70 when I had my race\nslump note that this was not a bonk more\nso a mental Battle of pushing through\nthe lull of the race it was at this\npoint though that we were met by a group\nof three Jim anel and Patrick so three\nbecame five and now we were cooking with\ngas\nyeah yeah TR\nbud\ngood it\nwork\none by you know\nTR chain Dr\nch\ncome\non anill is a very strong Rider and at\none point he took off and dropped us I\ndon't know if this was intentional or\nnot but either way I thought it was\nimportant to bring him back in to keep\nour group strong cruising Until the\nEnd let's get\nhim\nat this point in the race we were\nkeeping a steady pace and taking off the\nmiles we decided as a group to skip the\nlast aid station and power on until the\nend as we worked so well together to get\nto the Finish Line it felt strange\ntrying to beat each other out at the end\nof the time segment Jim and Dallas took\noff on a Sprint and I ended up giving it\nhalf an effort which paid off as it put\nme in just a slightly better position\nposition than the rest of my group so\nafter all was said and done I ended up\nwith a time of 7 hours 24 minutes for\nthe time segment which I believe was\nright around the 98 mile Mark for the\nwhole 110 or 109.5 6 is my Garmin\nrecorded it in the end I ended up with a\ntime of 8 hours and 4 minutes moving\ntime and 8 hours 17 minutes total time a\nresult I was pretty pleased with after\nnot having much long rides in the past\ncouple months and and facing sickness\nthe week before and on race day I was\nhappy with that so that is it for this\nvideo thank you to Adam for putting on\nthis race heck of a race Adam if you're\nin the peblo area or

You know, we created this\nthing so there'd be a great event here\nin Pueblo [music]\nthat welcomes everyone and our goal has\nbeen to see every flavor of human, every\ntype of bicycle [music] here. And that's\nhappening.\n&gt;&gt; We are getting ready to send out the\nnext stage of riders represent PBLO 719.\n[music] Couldn't ask for anything\nbetter. Quite honestly,\n&gt;&gt; I'm living right now. That's all I can\nsay. [music]\n[music]\nWe are all here to do the same thing,\nand that is to be here. Whether you're\nlooking to absolutely crush some time\nthat you have in your head on this\ncourse or you're looking to ride at\nwhatever pace it is you're looking to\nride at, be there for each other. That\nis what Grassroots Gravel is about. This\nis for everyone.\nSo make some NOISE IF YOU LOVE THIS\ncommunity\ncuz everybody's voice is important.\nEverybody matters and it's time we teach\nthese children how it's done.\nMake some noise.\n&gt;&gt; [music]\n&gt;&gt; Heat.\nHeat.\n&gt;&gt; Never seen so much smooth dirt in my\nknife.\n&gt;&gt; Beautiful day out here today.\n&gt;&gt; I'm feeling great about this race. The\ngravel's perfect. It's lots of rain last\nnight. I'm assuming the clouds are nice.\n&gt;&gt; Guys are great. Hydrating fueling. So\nhappy volunteers are here.\n&gt;&gt; The ride's been really fun. It's been\nbeautiful.\n&gt;&gt; I'm good. I'm here with my boy Jared.\nBeen great. Everyone's [music] in good\nattitude. Everyone's in good spirits.\nWe're handing out Sour Patch Kids.\n&gt;&gt; Here's Pueblo. It's a nice place. Riding\nthrough the town. Everyone's saying\nhello, waving. First bike ride of the\nyear.\n&gt;&gt; This is my first race and I'm really\nenjoying it. Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Can't beat the views. Yeah. Once you get\nout of town, you get the the valleys and\nthe pinions. Beautiful. If the podium is\njust being able to finish and not be\ninjured, I'm making that podium.\n&gt;&gt; I'm just honored to be able to ride with\nthese great athletes. Big thank you to\nthe all the folks volunteering at the\naid stations. Really appreciate it.\nMakes a big difference.\n&gt;&gt; The volunteers rough. We're [music] here\nat the top of the Solar Roast coffee\nclimb for Grassroots Gravel today and\nit's going great. We've had quite a few\nriders already come through. We are\nhelping out at the Bula Aid Station\ntoday and we are getting towards the\ntail end of all the riders, but it's\nbeen awesome. We've [music] had great\npeople coming through. We've been\nthrowing out gels. We've been filling up\nwater bottles and snacks. Bananas have\nbeen very popular today and giving\npeople fuel for their ride. [music]\nKeeping energy high.\n&gt;&gt; Hey,\n&gt;&gt; it was great.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, great experience. Amazing course,\nreally good vibes, perfect weather,\ngreat people.\n&gt;&gt; Freaking awesome. 1,200 people. Somebody\nfrom Canada came all the way down to\nPBLO, Colorado for this event.\n&gt;&gt; So, today we're here at Grassroots\nGravel. [music] Uh this is an amazing\nhomegrown event that started several\nyears ago. Uh and it's all about getting\npeople here to Pueblo and having an\namazing event [music]\nthat brings people to this town and\ngives back to the community. These are\nthe good times. [music] Blue.\n&gt;&gt; I'm Sam Moore. This is my dad, Chuck\nMoore. [music] Um, we've wanted to ride\nthis for the last few years and finally\ngot bikes to do it together.\n&gt;&gt; First time riding grassroots gravel.\nwhat we rode together. Sam's a lot\nbetter than me.\n&gt;&gt; We are with the Boys and Girls Club of\nPablo County. We have nine teens that\nparticipated in Grassroots Gravel today.\nI had a good time. Did you all have a\ngood time?\n&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Adaptive Adventures works with\nGrassroots as it is about everybody. We\nspecialize in getting people with\ndisabilities on bikes and in the great\noutdoors as a community doing good hard\nthings and pushing their limits.\n&gt;&gt; It's been amazing seeing all of the\nbikers coming in. Feel like this\ncaptures a lot of what PBLO is. It\nbrings in our PBLO chili stuff. It\nbrings in amazing dirt roads. And people\nthink [music] we're far away from the\nmountains, but we're really right there.\n&gt;&gt; It also showcases what PBLO has. And\npeople unfortunately give PBLO a bad\nrap. PBLO is a great place to be. It's a\ngreat place to live. It's the gateway to\neverything, whether you want to go west\nor east.\n&gt;&gt; I think it's important because I think\nit brings people to the community and it\nhighlights our community. It shows them\na different side of the community. One\nof UC Health's biggest [music] things is\nobviously preventive medicine and UC\nHealth wanted to sponsor something like\nthis where we get tons of people out\nhere doing [music] healthy activities uh\nand uh that just leads to better health\nin general. There's a lot of uh people\nthat are unaware of what PBLO is and\nwhat we do here. And we have great\nathletes, great events, a great town,\ngreat community. So, we want people to\ncome here. So, we'll continue to support\nthis and anything local. Thank you for\nbeing here for Grassroots Gravel 2025.\nSouth London [laughter]\nshould try."

      "transcript": "It's just weird.\n&gt;&gt; It's a tough situation.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Welcome back to my channel, everyone.\nFor the past 2 months, I have been\ntraining for my first gravel race, and\nall that work has led to this moment.\nIt's officially race week. And tomorrow,\nI start my drive to Colorado for\ngrassroots gravel. I currently live in\nsouthern Oregon, so that's going to be\nquite the haul. I figured I'd go ahead\nand show you what I'm packing and got\nquite a few things going on. So, let's\nget into that. I thought it'd be fun to\nkind of go through what I'm packing for\ncycling. All right, so as far as gear\ngoes, here is everything that I'm\npacking. I've got two different pattern\njerseys. I'm still deciding which one to\nwear because I'm not entirely sure what\nthe weather is going to be like in\nPueblo. If it's too hot, I definitely\nwon't be wearing the black. So, I'll go\nwith this pattern. But it's honestly\ndependent on the weather once we get\nthere. And then I also have two\ndifferent bibs to choose from. Same\nthing. If it's a little bit hotter, I'll\nbe wearing the cargo bib because it's a\nlittle bit lighter. Otherwise, I'll be\nwearing the matching jersey and bib\ncombo. I'll be bringing this windbreaker\nfrom Goreware as well. Since it's been\nso cold in southern Oregon, I've been\nusing this really frequently. It might\nbe so hot in PBLO. I have no idea. So,\nI'm just going to have it in my bag just\nin case. Last but not least are these\nPearly Zoomi cycling shoes. I've only\nbeen training with them for about a week\nand a half, but I love them. So, I'm\ngoing to go ahead and leave the Alt at\nhome and take these with me. So, that's\nit for clothes. Let me go ahead and pack\nthese up and then I'll show you some of\nthe smaller essentials I'm bringing with\nme. Okay, so right here are just a few\nthings that I'll be bringing. These are\nmy essentials for my race kit. Some bone\nconducting headphones. We've got our\nZeal Optics sunglasses. Of course, we\nhave our Smith helmet, my Apple Watch,\nand hoping that it doesn't die on me\nthis time because it always tends to do\nthat. And then these are actually a new\naddition to my kit. These are Cliff's\nblocks. These are energy chews. This one\nis black cherry, but it's got caffeine\nin it. And this is salted watermelon.\nIt's better for sodium and hydration.\nAnd then I've got my racing gloves. And\nthe latest addition is my Insta 360.\nThis will come in super handy while I'm\nactually out riding, so it'll hopefully\nbe able to help me capture part of the\nrace. So, I'm really excited for that\none. And of course, my water bladder is\nprobably one of the most important\nthings. This is by USA, and I use it on\nevery single ride. And yeah, so this is\nthe full race kit. I'm excited to\nactually put everything to use.\nYou know, I am super excited that it's\nfinally race week, but I won't lie, I'm\npretty nervous. I'm mostly anxious\nbecause this is something I've never\ndone before. Typically, people who know\nme know that I am a very riskadverse\nperson. So to be going to a gravel race\nwhere I've never been to PBlo, Colorado.\nI've never ridden on Colorado gravel\nbecause I know it's very different from\nsouthern Oregon gravel roads. And of\ncourse to be contending with elevation\nthat's a little bit higher than in\nsouthern Oregon. Definitely put myself\nin one of the most unique race\nsituations I could have for my first\none. All of this, by the way, is stuff\nthat I completely knew when I first\nsigned up for this race. But honestly,\nfor the first time, I really wanted to\ntake a risk and to dive into the unknown\nbecause I knew that this would be\nsomething that would push me past my\nlimits and honestly show me what I can\ndo when I push beyond my comfort zone.\nAfter these past few weeks, I've learned\nthat I actually approach fear in a very\ndifferent way where I used to avoid fear\ncompletely. Now, it's kind of like I\nfeel the fear and I know that I'm going\nto do it anyway. So, really what I'm\ntrying to say is I'm not someone who's\njust suddenly not scared anymore. I know\nthat if I let fear hold me back from\nuncomfortable situations, I will never\nget the reward for all of this hard\ntraining. And that to me would be an\nabsolute shame to let fear just get in\nthe way of any progress I could make.\nAll right, with that said, I need to put\nup the camera because I need to pack up\nmy car. So, I will see you from the road\nbright and early in the morning.\nGot the skybox over there.\nWe've got the bike rack and the bike\nover here. Ruby is working on a plan and\nwe are stuck here at this gas station in\nUtah. Oh, it's a tough situation.\n&gt;&gt; So sorry, but\n&gt;&gt; it's just it's just the bars at this\npoint. Good girl, baby. Good girl. I\nknow. We're coming.\n&gt;&gt; She's a queen.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; We're going to we're going to put these\ndown a little bit better.\n&gt;&gt; Actually, not bad.\n&gt;&gt; Not bad. I think that's the best we can\ndo right now. Let's put on the\n&gt;&gt; You're crushing it, Rubs.\n&gt;&gt; I'm sorry.\nWe're about to take off again. See how\nthis works.\n&gt;&gt; You want to try it?\n&gt;&gt; Let's do it.\nAll right.\nShe's holding.\nI think she's holding. Okay.\nHeat.\nFirst time in PBO, Colorado. So, had to\nget a shakeout ride in before the race.\nWe got Ruby\nfollowing. He's got the doggos.\nAll right, we're going to get moving\nagain. Let's get after it.\nDefinitely feeling tight from all the\ndriving, but honestly, I'm surprised\nthat I feel as good as I do right now.\nIt's getting late and I want to get a\ngood night's sleep. So, I think I'm\ngoing to go ahead and call it early. All\nright, 3 miles. Not bad.\nGood morning from Colorado. It is\nofficially race day and the sky is\nabsolutely blowing up behind me. It's so\nbeautiful. Don't mind my puffy face. It\nis early this morning. We are packing up\nand about to have some breakfast and\nthen we're going to hit the road and get\nto the expo center. Nerves are high, but\nwe're pushing through. Taking a deep\nbreath today. Let's get it.\n&gt;&gt; Hey.\n&gt;&gt; Hey, pop.\n&gt;&gt; Hey, I'm hiding. So,\n&gt;&gt; you're riding right now?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm riding.\n&gt;&gt; Sorry.\n&gt;&gt; Oh my god.\nHey, I just wanted to say uh you're\ngoing to do great today, so don't worry\nabout anything. It's just, you know,\nlittle pointers. You know, you're going\nto race, hold yourself back in the\nbeginning and then take off.\nAnd if you're going to just ride the\nrace, find yourself.\n&gt;&gt; Okay. Bye, Dad.\n&gt;&gt; Bye.\nYou're here to race and push yourself,\nbut you're also here to have fun. I hope\nsome flavor of that. So, let's make sure\nthat we are being respectful of our\nother riders. We're being respectful of\nour other motorists. And like\n&gt;&gt; if you are standing up for the Chili or\nthe mile.\n&gt;&gt; All these bike riders.\n&gt;&gt; Go have fun.\nAfter leaving town and riding about 3\nmiles on the road, I had finally reached\nthe point where the pavement turned to\ngravel.\nAnd then the real race began.\nMentally, that climb felt brutal. Heart\npumping hard, legs tight. My body was\nnot where I needed it to be. My energy\nquickly depleted once the adrenaline\nwore off, and I felt the lack of\ncalories set in.\n&gt;&gt; My goal quickly became make it to the\nfirst aid station and recover.\nLet's go.\n&gt;&gt; My lesson here, hydration and calories\nmake all the difference in mood.\n&gt;&gt; Let's go.\n&gt;&gt; Definitely hungry.\n&gt;&gt; Oh my god, my anxiety is gone now. I'm\nlike,\n&gt;&gt; I left that aid station in high spirits.\nStoked.\nWoo. That was a great stop.\nFeeling fueled up now. Feeling good.\nRuby and the dogs stopped to say hello.\nI actually just made my whole day. That\nwas amazing. I feel so stoked right now.\nHoly God damn. My gosh. I don't\neven know what I'm doing right now.\nI'm a racist. Oh my god.\nAfter that refuel, I fell into a groove\nand started feeling my training kick in.\nChipping away at miles and my confidence\ngrew.\nFeeling great.\nSometimes you got to give yourself a\nlittle pep talk. You know, no one's\ngoing to do it for you\nwhen you're out here by yourself.\nGot to keep that hype going.\nPerfect.\nEventually, I cruised to double digits\nand suddenly felt like my goal was in\nreach.\nHeat. Heat.\nOh\nmy gosh.\nHi.\n&gt;&gt; That is so cool, guys.\n&gt;&gt; It was It was incredible.\n&gt;&gt; I'm glad. I'm so happy for you.\n&gt;&gt; Thanks, Pop. Oh my gosh. First gravel\nrace in the books. Feeling so stoked\nright now. I finished two hours on the\ndot, 19.7 miles, which is my longest\nride.\nI mean, I I beat all of my PRs. Feeling\nso incredibly blessed right now. hanging\nwith Ruby and hanging with the dogs. I'm\ngonna go get some food because I need\nit. I'm feeling so so stoked and so high\nin life right now. That was incredible.\nShout out to Grassroots Gravel. You guys\nput on a great race. Absolutely awesome.\nThe stoke was so high the whole time.\nEnergy was impeccable.\nCould not want anything more than this.\nSo awesome. Guys, thanks for following\nalong. It's been an amazing ride."
