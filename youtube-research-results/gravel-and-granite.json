      "transcript": "[Music]\nThe gravel and granite is really a tough\ngravel riding event. We've sent these\nriders off onto trails that range from,\nyou know, gravel roads to natural gravel\nfire trail surfaces and I guess that's\nthe essence of the gravel and granite.\nIt's a tough adventure type ride.\nLadies and gentlemen, your attention\nplease. In three, two, one, roll away.\nSo, the different courses this year, we\nhave the Rain Rumble 91 km, the\nWellington Rocks course, 66 km, and the\nBasket Swamp Bash, which is our short\ncourse adaptive ride, 38 km back into\ntown. The course today was very\nchallenging. Bit carnage, few crashes,\nlots of cramps, lots of injuries. That\nall makes for good riding. There's\nnothing wrong with the challenge.\nSo, we done the Curry's Dash today. It\nwas 11Ks. It's a good little course for\nkids.\nIt was a really good family friendly.\nIt was very fun. Very bumpy.\nIt's really nice to actually do a ride\nas a family together. So, that was\npretty special that we could do that\ntoday. Attention field.\nIt was an awesome weekend. Really\nwellrun event. Very inclusive. Nothing's\na drama, mate. I love it. I still got a\ngrin on me face just thinking about it.\nIt's been one of the best years so far\nand it will only get bigger and better.\nI think\nit truly is a a magical place to to\nride."

      "transcript": "so good morning we are at the gravel and\nrunner event and today i'm doing a 68k\ngravel ride and i'm doing it on my\nmountain bike because we don't have\ngravel bikes\nseems to be that there's a lot of people\non mountain bikes\nso it should be fun these events seem to\nbe a lot more casual everyone we've\nspoken to is like we're not racing we're\njust out to enjoy the day so that's what\nwe'll be doing\nwaiting at the start line looking around\nseeing all the different people all\ndifferent ages different shapes and\nsizes different styles of bikes\nand we're ready to go\nthere's a\nfew e-bikes\nlots of gravel bikes\nand lots of mountain bikes\ntwo k's in\nyou know\ni'm feeling puffed but\ni'll come good soon\nso as people started to ride away\nfrom me i looked back\nand i said oh my god i'm lost\nbut it's just a big gap\nback to the next people\ni'm about to get our first little\ndownhill\nyesterday was frighteningly cold\nwhen we got here\nand i brought three layers so a base\nlayer\nmy jersey and in a\nwind vest\nand my arm almost\ni decided against the wind vest\nand i'm pretty sure i'm going to take my\narm warmers off soon\nor at least drop them down\nso this type of event for me is just all\nabout having fun just going out and\nenjoying it seeing a new place\nanother e-bike going past\nbeen lots of those so mostly uphill so\nfar\nabout eight and a half k's and\nprobably averaging\nfive to seven k's an\nthe hour\naround there was absolutely stunning it\nwas just you know every time you went\naround a corner you just saw more hills\nand you know i stopped to take photos\ngoing along these corrugations i'd heard\nif you go on the right hand side so in\nthe opposite way to where you would\nnormally ride that the corrugations\nwouldn't be as rough but i'm not sure if\nthat's the\nif that's the case\njust riding down here just\nyou know you didn't know where to look\nso it's just beautiful views left and\nright\nso there's a lot of gravel a lot of\nwater\ncrossings as well\nand these guys said um you know they\nwere in our draft and they said that\nwe're going to\nreturn the favor and they never did\nbut i did actually meet a couple of\npeople when i was out riding and this\nlady here karen on the left actually\nlives just near me in brisbane so we're\ngoing to catch up for a few rides\nso this is one of the feed stations\nthere was in the 65k there were two feed\nstations that was one of them where you\ncould stop refill water bottles get some\nbananas and fruit and lollies i didn't\nstop at either of those\nit's amazing out here so beautiful\nthe gopro won't pick it up\nit's just stunning\nyou know some people might think that\nthey can't enter a race like this\nbecause they're not good enough but you\nknow anyone can do this race there were\nsections on road so you know as long as\nyou can ride a bike you could actually\ndo it it didn't really matter how long\nyou took there was a cut off but uh it\nwas a really generous cut off\nso two hours and almost 40 k's\ni'm averaging about 20 k's an hour so\nbut there is one big climb to come\nand one big downhill\nif you like our content and would like\nto support us you can now buy us a\ncoffee just go to the link in the\ndescription below\nand follow the prompts\nso the roads weren't closed to the\npublic um so there were still cars\naround but i think i probably saw that\nmaybe four or five cars\nand then they were waving and very\nfriendly out there\nso i think the next 10 k's\nroughly is\nuphill i probably won't feel much of\nthat\ntim's got the gopro on his handlebar\nso i might have to steal some of his\nfootage\nanyway\nheads up\nlook at the view\nso i passed a lady just before this and\nshe was walking her bike she said i'm\nalready i'm too tired to actually get on\nmy bike i'm like don't worry it'll\nflatten out soon and then i was like oh\nactually that's not flattening out\nthat's getting steep\nso this was the steepest part the\nsteepest hill on the course\nat the top got to like 23\nincline so pretty steep i did get off at\nthe end\nhere's a couple of e-bikes coming up\nand even they\ndidn't do it easily\ni didn't quite make it up\nphotos at the top\nthis is hands behind me he's ridden this\nbike\nfrom siberia\nto australia\ni used to run with him\nthe gold coast runners club but now he\nlives out here\nit was always nice just chatting to\npeople as you were riding past so you'd\nstop and you know just have a little\nchat about where they were how they're\nfeeling\nyou know that's the kind of event that\nthis is it's really casual for most\npeople there's a couple of people out\nthe front who are actually racing for\nmost people i think it's just a chance\nto get out and see some different\ncountryside\nwe've got about 10 k's to go\ni'm really looking forward to this\n55k\nthree hours fourteen\non the sealed road\nfor the final\nrun into town\nand put the gopro away and go fast\n[Music]\nwoohoo\nthat down here was so fun but i ran out\nof gears yes everyone did yeah\noh look at you smiling\nit was a really good atmosphere after\nthe event as well and they had food\ntrucks and beer and wine drinks big\ntents for everyone to\nhang out together\nand talk about\nhow hard that how hard the hills were\nand how fast they went on the downhill\nso then we rode back to our caravan park\nbefore heading back to the event\ni loved it it was just it was a great\nevent really well run event so thanks\ngravel and granite for having us\nwe had an awesome time\nyou know we're going back to the\nshowgrounds tonight just to finish off\nand have a bit of a party okay here are\nmy stats sorry distance was 65.6\nkilometers\ntime was three hours 42\naverage speed 17.7 k's an hour i burnt\n949 calories my maximum speed was 56.3\nkilometers an hour that was fun my\naverage heart rate 128 beats per minute\nthe total ascent was\n1113 meters in 65 case\nand if you're worried about being last\nlook at the reception that these people\ngot these this couple here for the last\nones across the line\nand they got everyone cheering for them\nand they even got champagne at the ends\ni didn't get champagne maybe i should\nhave gone slower\nso get some free champagne\nand thanks for racing with me"
