many hotels\nand other\nattractions sit back and enjoy the\nspectacle of the 2019 gravel andar CL\nit's 30 minutes before the start of this\nyear's event Steve how are some of those\nteams feeling yeah look I think there's\na few nervous Riders out there today uh\nit's the first race of the season for a\nlot of them uh some of the teams have\nbeen newly formed uh Evo Pro is a great\nexample they're a UCI Continental team\nit's their very very first race we're\nunderway but the first 4ks are\nneutralized so the racing won't really\nstart until the commer drops the flag so\nSteve who's looking good this year team\nScot to racing here for the fourth year\nthey've got Alex West he's been runner\nup twice my money's on him Oliver's food\nracing from New South Wales they're a\npretty good outfit team Nero ban they're\nnew from Sydney they'll be here to win\nas well and of course the New Zealand\nnational team with the likes of James\narum and Ryan\nChristensen this is the time when the\nRiders get themselves into position\nbecause as soon as the flag drops the\nRAC is on\n[Music]\nTire Choice is critical in this race\nthey need something that's going to\nwithstand the rigers of the gravel but\nfast enough on the bitchman so equipment\nis really going to be\ntested the race has started and already\nthere's been an attack we got two down\nthe road I reckon they'll be gobbled up\npretty quickly\nthough the bunch is stringing out\nclearly the paac is on there's some\nRiders trying to get off the front\nthere's plenty sitting on they are\nlooking for an easy ride until the\ngravel\nstarts white fox Evo New Zealand\nnational they're all trying to get away\nat the start they look it's really\nstringing out now the pace is really hot\nit's going to be hard in that\nBunch some Riders are going to find it\neasier on the bitchman some Riders going\nto find it easier on the\ngravel there's a long Convoy that\nfollows the\nRiders each team has a car that contains\nspares it feeds the\nRiders and you can see Team fio scota\nanimating the race\nthere they're about to enter gravel\nsector number one this is really going\nto test the legs because they're all\nfighting for position to get on the\nfirst you can see dust is being kicked\nup by the Riders they're breathing that\nin they're getting it in their eyes and\nit makes it just harder and\nharder already the bunch of split up on\nthe front there bike box really pushing\nthe\n[Applause]\npace this is going to be a really really\nimportant point in the race because if\nthis break can\nstick that's game over\noh there's been a crash and AMR rid has\ncome down I wonder if he's going to keep\ngoing that's game\nover the first climb of the day comes\nnot long after the Sprint at beaconfield\nwe've got a front bunch of about 13\nRiders it's breaking up slightly it's\ngoing to break up more during the second\nsector we got a pretty big pelaton in\nChase I suspect there's a few that have\ngone off the back stuck in the Convoy\nthere's been some punctures on the first\nsector they'll be chasing they'll be\nworking really hard to get back\non in my mind the front bunch is a\nlittle bit too big to work well I think\nit's going to have to get a bit smaller\nbefore we start to see the the real\nbreak of the day\ngo Steve looking at this Bunch who do\nyou think's got the form to take the\ntitle this year\nit's a numbers game Mark Evo Pro got two\nor three in there I can see a couple of\nOlivers New Zealand national team B box\nlocally Glenn Haden he's The Hard Man of\nlongoi racing my money's on him out of\nthat\nbreak they're going to end a gravel\nsector number three at the moment\nthere's a bit of a pause between sectors\nit'll be interesting to see what happens\nnow St into gravel sector 3 it's the one\nthat teams have been dreading there'll\nbe a bit of\nconcern yeah the gravel here is about 3\nft date there's going to be some\naccidents we're off tar and we're on to\nthe unpredictable surface of gravel how\ndo these Road Riders approach that well\nit's a bit like driving a car when\nyou're driving on gravel you really got\nto concentrate a momentary laps of\nconcentration is going to see you off\nthe side of the road in a bike race it's\ngoing to see you eating some\ndust one of the things these Riders will\nquickly realize is they're not going to\nbe able to get out of the saddle when\nthey go up a hill they got to stay\nseated they got to put the power down\nand theyve just got to grind their way\nup the climbs that's the only way to\nmake sure they keep traction Steve we're\nin the middle of gravel Section 3 what\nare the tactics here for the\nRiders it's a pretty hot day out there\nthey're going to need to refuel you can\nsee we've just been through a feed Zone\nif they don't pick up a bottle now\nthey're going to be in trouble later\non and it looks like the front punch has\nbeen Whitted down to five\nRiders yeah we've got two Evo Pros there\nand we've got two New Zealand national\nand we've got Glenn Haden I had my money\non him earlier\non Haden's been unlucky not to win this\nrace before we saw him two years ago\npunter in the last\n5K we're on the manow 2 River path now\nthere's still five Riders there we're\nabout to enter the Higgins Gravel Pit\nlet's see what happens\ndreaded Higgins Gravel Pit it's killed a\nfew Riders chances in the past let's see\nwhat it does this\nyear we're coming to the end of the\nGravel Pit all five front Riders have\ngotten out\nunscathed oh headen had a puncher oh\nthat's just bad\nLu he get n going in there two away and\nthere's four left two Evo proo two New\nZealand national team oh the attacks are\nstarted it's New Zealand national team\nquickly counted by Evo Pro they'll shut\nthis down Evo Pro\nagain shutting it\nDown 2 km to go now we're hitting the\nmain road 2 km to the Finish let's see\nwhat happens it's going to be really\ninteresting from here just over a kilom\ngo mudway leads out the Sprint\nChristian's trying to get in his wheel\nCyrus M stuck behind\nJames arum oh Luke mud's got this\neasy Ryan Christensen second sarus mon\nthird what a great result first race and\nit's a win for Evo Pro what a fantastic\nresult those guys are going to be stoked\nyeah that's a great win for Evo Pro\ntheir first professional race winning\nstraight up Luke mudway what a great\nresult their team manager Morgan Fox is\ngoing to be absolutely ecstatic\nso this team's set for good things it\nsounds like today's team effort feels\ngood yeah it's good to to start the\nseason with a win you know it's our\nfirst race um yeah all of us all of us\nboys um really want to help each other\nand and and we want to move up as a team\nso um yeah I guess it's just us working\nwith the staff and and working together\nand just get into every race and in the\nbest best possible form and and just try\nand move up the rank and and see where\nwe can go last question just from your\nown perspective you you've ridden the\nrace four years in a row here we go the\nM War I it's a pretty tough place to\nride with wind and all sorts of\ndifferent things a gorgeous place of\ncourse all of that but today's today 130\nK five sages of gravel was that\nseriously tough out there it's just a\nruthless race it's um you got to have a\nbit of balls to to to run into these\nthese Gra sections going the speeds were\ngoing um you got to you got to be smart\nand make sure you're not Hing any rocks\ncuz you blow your tire out um and yeah\nat the same time you got to you got to\nhave tactics as well so you got to be\nsmart and and the boys rode really well\ntoday and um we talk to each other a lot\num and it's just a race where you just\ngot to keep assessing what situation\nyou're in after each section and um and\nthen yeah make it plan and then try and\nexecute it you did this that you've just\nwon the gravel entire classic for 2019\nLuke Luke MJ everybody that is\nfantastic great conditions great riding\nand a great result for the teams thanks\nfor taking in the 2019 gravel Andre\nclassic we'll look forward to

people have gone for 23s they're\nthe bog standard road tires I think the\nsmart operators are going for 28 mil\ntires it's going to make it so much\neasier on the gravel you can see there\nmik G Homes New Zealand national team\nthey'd have to be the favorites two\nreally strong teams\nkeep your eye on the Oceana selection\nteam in particular team captain Brody\nChapman she won last year's son to her\nshe's in form she'll go well on the\ngravel the flag has dropped and the\ngirls are on their way how do you think\nit's going to pan\nout there doesn't seem to be any urgency\nin the bunch I think they're waiting for\nsector\none my feeling is the bunch will just\nsit there for a while there's going to\nbe some nervous girls in there this is\nthe first gravel and TI of\n[Music]\nf the pace is starting to string out now\nthey're probably trying to position\nthemselves to the first gravel\nsector Kath the pace is starting to pick\nup and who are a couple of riders who\nhave caught your eye today well I\ndefinitely keep my eye on Brady Chapman\nriding for the Oceania team team and\nRiley McMullen who's riding for Mike G\nhomes today should be one to watch as\nwell the first gravel sector on Junction\nRoad can't be far away now the girls\nwill be starting to get nervous um it'll\nbe just interesting to see how they\nreally approach this this sector whether\nthey go really hard to get on there\nfirst that's my\nsuspicion we're about to turn into\nJunction Road and you can see here the\ncorrugations on the road it wouldn't\nsurprise me if there's going to be a few\naccidents certainly the bunch is\ncompletely starting to split up now you\ncan see the gaps opening up some of the\ngirls are trying really hard just to\nkeep up they're following the road\ntracks you can see that they're uh\neither got to be on the left or they got\nto be on the\nright oh there's a few oh there's been\nan accident one of the oceanana teams\ncome down she'll get back on a bike and\nget going\nthere breakway group already started to\nform on this first sector it'll be\ninteresting to see whether they can keep\nthe\n[Applause]\nGap Katherine there's still 80 K to go\nhow are the Riders keeping themselves on\nthe pace for the\nrace well Mark everyone will be carrying\nat least two drink bottles\nuh so keeping themselves well hydrated\nand they'll also have some food in their\nback pockets possibly some caffeine gels\nand they'll be um spreading that out\nevenly through the race but of course\nwith the gravel sectors in there they'll\nhave to choose when they eat because you\nwon't be able to eat when you're on the\ngravel what we've got is a front bunch\nof about 20 Riders left they're heading\ntowards the O Ru River Valley and then\nsector 3 sees a good gravel climb from\nthere I suspect that's where we're going\nto see it really break up one of the\nthings these Riders will quickly realize\nis they're not going to be able to get\nout of the saddle when they go up a hill\nthey got to stay seated they got to put\nthe power down and they've just got to\ngrind their way up the climbs that's the\nonly way to make sure they keep traction\nwe're off tar and we're on to the\nunpredictable surface of gravel how do\nthese Road Riders approach\nthat well it's a bit like driving a car\nwhen you're driving on gravel you really\ngot to concent\na momentary lapse of concentration is\ngoing to see you off the side of the\nroad in a bike race it's going to see\nyou eating some\ndust well in this race it's really\nimportant how the rest of the the second\nand third Riders finish so they'll be\ntrying to save as much energy as they\ncan for the end of the race and they'll\nbe trying to stay with the Riders of the\ntrying to chase down those first\ntwo we're onto the ashur bunny thought\nroad now there's two away Jen Merck\nBrody Chapman they've got a huge gap on\nthe chasing pelaton I can't see anyone\ncatching them it's going to be these two\non the podium\nwe're in the Higgins Gravel Pit now\nhere's the chasing Bunch they're still 5\nminutes behind so this is going to be a\nSprint for\nthird here's our front two exiting\nHiggins on a tomato Road it's going to\nbe a two-up Sprint\nwe're into the finishing straight now\nit's going to be a two up is it going to\nbe Chapman is it going to be Merck\nChapman's

      "transcript": "hello and welcome to our coverage of the\nsecond edition of the gravel and tart La\nFemme raced with in the scenic manometer\nregion of New Zealand sport and outdoor\npursuits are an important part of our\nregion's identity situated between the\nwest coast and the rugged rural Heaney\nranges it is known for its multitude of\nrecreational opportunities Palmerston\nNorth proudly hosts many national and\ninternational events the gravel entire\nhas cemented itself within the\nInternational Road Cycling calendar and\nhas become known as one of the toughest\none-day races in the world starting in\nthe award-winning town of fielding an\nagricultural hub known as the home of\none of the biggest stock trading centres\nin New Zealand the gravel and tar always\nenjoys a warm welcome from the locals of\nthis beautiful colonial town the\ntwenty20 event takes in the lush and\ngreen farmland of the manoa to the\nwinding gravel roads at the Bahaman are\nwatersheds and the fertile mana WA to\nRiver Plains once again finishing in the\nregion centre Palmerston North so sit\nback and enjoy the spectacle of the 2020\ngravel and tart la femme well here we\nare in fielding for the start of the\n2020 gravel and Tala femme at the moment\nthe commissary is just getting the race\nunderway while it's still neutral it's a\ntight field it's a quality field Oh\nCatherine there's some great riders here\nwho would the riders just here to be on\nthe podium today well Steve I think two\nof the stronger girls that were gonna\nhave there today are of course Matilda\nReynolds from green monkey specialized\nwomen this racing who won the Criterium\nyesterday she's going really well\nshe's just come off the tour done down\nunder and what's more she's got a great\nteam behind her then also we've got Neve\nFischer black rolling from New Zealand\nwomen's team they've picked up a\ncontract with Bigler katusha this year I\nsaw her before the race and she's\nlooking lean mean and really really good\nyeah and they're about to start the race\nhere getting onto the final straight\nbefore the flag is gonna be dropped\nlet's see what happens and you can see\nnow the race has started it's pretty\ncalm it doesn't seem to be any earlier\nattacks I suspect they're waiting for\nthe first gravel sector it's a while\naway to that sector and there's going to\nbe a bit of wind in between I'm\nexpecting a few attacks early on\nguessing what effect you think the wind\nis going to have on how this race pans\nout Steve strong winds are going to play\nright into the hands of the strongest\nteam so green monkeys specialized are\ngoing to love it if it's windy\nparticularly towards the end of the race\nso we're about 20k in so far it's a wild\non the first gravel sector there's a new\ncourse this year the idea was to put a\nbit more bitumen in before the gravel\nand and just to let it be a little bit\nmore like a normal road race before we\nhit the hard sections and the race\nstarts to break up you'd see there\nthere's a bit of crosswind a smallish\nline forming and some of the girls at\nthe back having trouble fairly early on\nso it's gonna be just you to see what\nhappens later on especially when we get\nup top of the the watersheds where\nthere's a crosswind on top of the the\nhills\nand the race is going through some\nbeautiful scenery those are the raw\nhoney ranges in the background\nbeautiful rural farmland\nthe men would choose the food bowl of\nNew Zealand really nice and green\nand you can see the girls going down\nthere across a ridge the winds starting\nto pick up a little bit you could see\nthem tucking into the left-hand side the\nshelter at the moment by that rubber\ntrees but as soon as they get out from\nthe shelter I expect to see it get a\nlittle bit harder\nanother of the international riders to\nwatch could be Molly patch from the UK\nMolly's riding in Australia this year\nbut in 2018 she won the UK Time Trial\nChampionships so she's a very strong\nrider there's a bit of jockeying here\nfor position they're going to turn\naround soon and there's a intermediate\nsprint coming up there's have been and\nmoney up for grabs and then lining it\nout down the hill now green monkey\nyou're gonna try and line it up from\nMatilda rein old she got third at one of\nthe Santos Tour Down Under stages the\nother day she's a good sprinter let's\njust see what happens here in New\nZealand national team they're gonna be\nlooking for a need Fischer black to win\nthis sprint it's a little climb just\nbefore the Sprint's I'll be sure to see\nwho actually comes over the top they are\ndizzy Raiola she's well in front does it\nshe's from Switzerland she's gonna take\nthis sprint home closely followed by I\nthink that's Katie Richards j0l is a\nvery experienced rider she wrote for\nSwiss Bigler team for five years and for\nthe last four she's been riding in the\nDutch woman's racing so it's not long\nnow out of that first gravel sector for\nthe girls\nthey're turning now into Coulter's line\nyou've got to be up the front when you\nhit this sector or you've got no chance\nthis is the Oh roar River Valley it's\nbeautiful and green down here now what\nthe girls if they've done this race\nbefore gonna know this is a climb coming\nup it looks like they've got back\ntogether after that sprinting as a\ncompact Bunch coming into the bottom of\nthe hill you can see they're just\nworking their way up the gravel climb\nhere it looks like there's been an\nattack on the climb it's starting to\nbreak up on yeah definitely breaking up\nthere we've got one in front I think\nthat's no you Fischer black and no one\nin sight behind it's a great move though\nyou've starting to pull out a fairlead\nthere the other two are a long way\nbehind at this point she thought about\nit she's put about\ni mean--it into them and we've got a\nchasing bunch of five we've got two\ngreen monkeys in there a New Zealand\nnational and the two chasers let's blow\nfrom Australia and Shepherd from New\nZealand they're still struggling to put\ntime into the leader named Fisher black\nand here's the chase group here it's\nbeing whittled down to four and they\nlook like they're uh struggling a little\nbit ups their resigned to running fourth\nfifth and sixth we can see the effect\nthe wind is having here now with the\ngirls special on data across the road\nthat's gonna be pretty hard for riders\nthat are on their own in the chase with\nElla blonde we've got Samara Shepherd\nfrom the New Zealand women's team Samara\nwent to the Commonwealth Games in 2018\nas a mountain biker so she's mixing that\nwith a bit of a road racing this year\nand talking to her before the race she\nconfessed that today would only be the\nsecond time she's been on the grill\nAnnie Fisher black right up the front\nthere she's passing the first rider and\nthe slicks and stones so that's how good\na rider she is not longer this last\ngravel sector now let's see what happens\nhere we are and Eve still in front the\ngaps being whittled down to about 20\nseconds from the chasing - it's going to\nbe hard for them to catch her at the end\nI think Nev so strong and he is the\nfollowing five new Fischer black gravel\nentire Lapham first across the line\nfirst GC I win and a great start for her\nfor the 2020 season\n[Music]\nso how was that ladies people who said\nthat before it's just so hard well done\nwell done\n[Applause]\nyou"
