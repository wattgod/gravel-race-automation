      "transcript": "[Music]\nRonda van vandren or the tour of\nFlanders is a brutal Cobble classic that\neach year pushes the world's best\ncyclist to their limits in search of\nVictory but I'm here for the first ever\nFlanders gravel event organized by the\nsame team who put on the pro race this\nis a bike festival with Flemish cobbles\niconic climbs brilliant gravel roads\nBelgium beer and of course great coffee\nShimano sponsor the pro race and are\nalso sponsoring the gravel event in fact\nit's thanks to Shimano that I'm here\ntaking part and able to show you what\nit's all about I'm going to be taking on\nsome of the famous sections from the\nrace including OD deermont the patberg\nand finishing on the brutal Cobble climb\nof the cofen\nBG it's 6:00 in the morning I've just\nclimbed out of bed and it's time for\nbreakfast before the big event cant soft\nbreed Brios Rose Nutella\nand a coffee you probably would have\nprepared a slightly bigger breakfast\nsomething a bit more substantial for\nsuch a big event however we got to our\naccommodation quite late last night so\nthere wasn't many options in terms of\nshops that were open and cuz the uh\nevent start so early this morning\nthere's nothing open again still so this\nis what I've got and I'll make do with\nuh make do with it my category or\ndistance 160 km due to go off between\nhalf I say and just gotone 9 9:00 I'm\njust looking here and uh on the phone\napp it says at 9:00 it's going to be\n4\u00b0 now I have not planned very well for\nthat I was hoping it would be warm and\nas such I've only got shorts with\nme we've made it to the center of oudard\nand behind me is the event Village so I\ncan head over and sign on pick up my\nnumber and all any useful bits of\ninformation that can uh set me up for\nthe day and then hopefully the day will\nbreak righten up and we can get started\nready for our 160 km Adventure although\nuh little bit chilly so hopefully it\nwarms up in a\nminute yep okay Alex yeah okay I've\ncollected my race number also I've got\nmy voucher here for lunch and a nice\nlittle beer at the end of the day\nthankfully I'll enjoy that and then also\nI'm picking up some zip ties and this\nsort of like glorified stem notes\neveryone knows a great ride starts with\na great coffee so let's get the coffees\nin before we start and get sorted for\nthe\nday I thought it was like I was going to\nbe grided 59th but I think it was just I\nsigned on quite early so I think maybe I\nwas the 59th person to be so Keen to\nsign on give it the official gcn cobbles\ntest yeah that's\nperfect right bikes all sorted tire\npressure are done chains lubricated got\nmy Wahoo on got my GoPro on got a kind\nof muck off bam just to so of get me out\nof trouble got my spares here which I'm\ngoing to put in one of my bottle cages\nand then the important part of the day\nis my little coupon for my burger at\nlunchtime so I'm going to tuck that in\nhere to keep it nice and safe because\nthe last thing I want is that falling\nout of my pocket mid\nride right Flanders gravel the first\ngroup have gone off means I'm already\nrunning behind I better take a deep\nbreath and start this adventure see you\nout on the road or the\ngravel well I'm\nunderway made it into a little group of\nfour of us we got me on a gravel bike\nsomebody else on a gravel bike one\nperson on a cyclocross bike and the\nother guy is on a mountain bike first\nbit of gravel for the day and we're\nsettling in nicely little bit chilly but\nhopefully the sun will come up soon and\nit's a PR nice crisp\nmorning now then I've just dropped off\nthe back of that group up there in the\ndistance chatting away to a lovely\ngentleman\nand I was asking him how confident he\nfelt on\nthe 160 km route because I was saying\nhow you know I was finding it slightly\ndaunting it's a big challenge lying\nahead and\nuh you're honestly not going to believe\nthis he goes oh you're you're on the 120\nkm route and I say how have I managed to\ndo that and it turns out where I had my\nS head down concentrating in the group\nchatting a away to everybody I managed\nto miss the split where the courses\ndivide and the 160 km went one way and\nthe 120 the other so there's my reason\nI'm currently on 120 km route enjoying\nit\nnonetheless but I felt like I kind of\nhad to explain this\nbecause well I just didn't think anyone\nwould possibly believe me that that was\nthe case and that I'd sort of cut my\nride short\nfirst feed stop of the day check out all\nof that stuff look at this we got\nwaffles got energy bars we got black\njacks fruit and N if that's your thing\noranges\nbananas drinks I'm back on the road and\ngravel again so while I find my Groth\nand find my rhythm and get my mojo and\nlegs moving again let me explain to you\nall about the bike I'm using for the\nevents so this is my bike the canyon\nGrail CF SLX and it's fitted with\nshimano's latest grx di2 gravel specific\ngroup set I'm currently running it in a\n2 by setup and Shimano were kind enough\nto supply us with this group set earlier\non this year and it's been used by a\nnumber of various different GCM\npresenters to help them complete various\nchallenges and epic rides and currently\nit's my turn to put this group set\nthrough its paces and so far it stood up\nvery well to everything that we could\nhave thrown at it to be precise it's the\nRX 815 group set and at the center of\nthe bike I've got a 48 to large chain\nring and a 31 Toth in ring the disc\nrotors are 140 mm at the back and 160 at\nthe front the good thing about the grx\ngravel specific rear deria is that it\nhas a clutch that means that the chain\nis held nice and securely over the bumpy\nterrains I'm also running the grx gravel\nspecific wheel set on this bike paired\nup to some purly cinturato gravel H\nTires these are a 40 mm width and I've\ngot them set up tubeless at the front of\nthe bike you may well notice the levers\nare quite different to what you might be\nfamiliar with with some of shimano's\nRoad group sets for example we've got\nquite a different shape and profile\nespecially right at the top where your\nhand sits and also the lever blade\nitself the rubber Hood cover has got a\ntextured finish to help provide\nadditional grip over bumpy terrains or\nif your hands get a bit wet and muddy as\nhas the lever blade itself it's both\nshaped differently to the road levers\nand also has a textured finish on it\nagain to try and help provide that extra\nlittle bit of grip over rough terrains\nand once your hands are a bit wet and\nslippery and then finishing the bike off\nour set of Shimano XT mountain bike\npedals would you just look at that\nSunshine so bright it's making me\nsquint\nglorious run a fairly nice\nstraightforward bit of road for a while\nnow so why\nnot let me tell you a bit more about the\nevent at the start of today when I\nmanaged to speak to all round procycling\nLegend Lawrence tendam who is well\nrenowned for his gravel\nExplorations and he's even got his own\ngravel race series and the event is\nactually partnered up with you so tell\nus a little bit about the reasons behind\nit and what makes this such a cool event\nso the partnership started like one year\nago because people from flus Classics\nwent to one of my own events they like\nthe atmosphere I like fless I just did\nfless alternative uh so I I did all the\nCobble climbs just from a different side\nto try to get them from from the Sid\nfrom gravel and we made a movie about\nthat and they like that movie and we\nyeah so it was a one in one you know\nthey like the events the atmosphere of\nmy events how we make a festival area\nhow we have the music over there the\nbeers The Quon it's really cool cool to\nsee and it's great to have like you say\nthe cool atmosphere so many people\ntogether enjoying cycling yeah people\nare going to try and race people are\ngoing to have fun yeah um and there's\nall the different various routes that\nyou can do so today what route are you\ndoing uh I think I do the 120 so to be\nhonest I uh I was here in Spring two\ndays to do the all Recon so I did all\nthe routes I did and I did all the I I I\nI saw everything but to be honest I\nnever finished the 160k it's long it's\nhard and I thought people from fonders\nuh Classics from flers G actually back\nthen I said because they were a little\nbit in uh doubting if one 60k was enough\nbecause you know if you're inbound or\nyour other races in the US it's all 200\nmiles which is 320\nkilomet and I said no no worry it's\nenough it's plenty you know it's up down\nleft right Cobble climb it's you never\nlike at East well in the US you can like\nzoom out you know like you have just\nlike a straight for like 20 miles and\nyou don't have any corners and here it's\nalways a little bit it's it's like\nflamish racing road racing you know you\nhave to be focused you have to be there\nand after 6 hours you're like\nthis so I'm about to be overtaken by\nquite possibly the world's smallest\ncar look at that\nthing I don't even know if I'd fit\ninside that well Connor definitely\nwouldn't um oh right turn turning right\nnearly missed\ncobbles woo first cobbles of the\nday I'm I'm a bit out of breath there's\na\nuh there's a group of Ro Riders local\nclub club ride behind\nme they're chasing me down I'm doing my\nbest to hold him at Bay but I got a long\nway to go to the end don't invest all my\neffort this is a key moment of the ride\nnow we're at the uh lunchtime Burger\nStop look how cool this atmosphere\nis got a bit of music playing Burgers we\ngot bikes we got coffee we got beer\nalcohol free I got to add that um\napparently the alcoholic beer is only\navailable is only available at the uh at\nthe end of the event which I guess makes\nsense you know if we had a beer right\nnow I'm not sure I'd get back on my bike\nright we're well over halfway through\nthe 120 km route which I've chosen to do\ntoday although inadvertently chosen to\ndo it but anyway that's another story\nI'm quite full from my burger that's\ngoing to fuel me through for the rest of\nthe ride and I guess I really just need\nto get my head down focus on trying to\nmake as good progress as I can I've been\ntucking into some little groups which\nhas been great on some of the faster\nRoad sections yeah we're just enjoying\nit look at the open road\nand it's been really cool chatting to\nloads of different people everyone has a\nslightly different story to tell\neveryone's on a slightly different bike\nbe food and drink or around the stations\nthe GPX maps and a great atmosphere what\nmore could you possibly want from a\ngravel race food great atmosphere\nfriendly people some people taking it\nseriously some people having a great\ntime and I've been chatting to loads of\npeople and it's just been a really good\nevent three of the big climbs done but\nthere's about 18 to go so three of the\nbig climbs 18 to go I think we'll just\nleave it at that and one sort of\nresounding answer I'm getting from\npeople is that they're kind of just\nhaving a great time and I think that's\nit's kind of reflected on me a little\nbit i' taking a step back from just\ntrying to race all the way around and\nI've just enjoyed lots of different\nscenery the climbs the famous climbs on\nthe tour of Flanders and it's been great\nfun\nthese guys are not hanging\nabout I've just been passed by Florian\nVish second place in par Bay and I can\ntell you what they are motoring around\ncourse look at this Lotto sadar Riders\nfloring\nVish just crashed\ncrashed the great thing about flanders's\ngravel is we've got mountain bikers cyc\ncross Riders gravel Riders and Road\nRiders some um with slightly better\nskills than others Florian is obviously\nuh perfectly fine through there second\nplace per Bay no sweat well back onto\nthe course see you guys in a\nbit I think I might be a bit out of\ndepth in this group these guys are\npressing on a bit more than me\nI was getting a little bit tired on my\nride and um I thought I'd got to another\nfeed station that was on the ride um I\nstopped and asked for some cake and it's\njust some lovely people they're having a\npicnic for the afternoon and have' been\nkind enough to donate some to\nme and we're well into the last 5\nkilometers of the route now we're on\nnice gravel tracks it's been really good\nso far I am starting to get quite tired\nand all that stands between me and the\nend is's a few little gravel tracks some\ntwisty technical sections then We're\nlooping all the way around to the\ninfamous coppen BG Cobble climb which\nnearly everyone should be familiar with\non the television and uh it's going to\nbe a real sting in the tail so fingers\ncrossed I just got the last little bit\nof My legs left to get me always the top\ncuz it's going to be a it's going to be\na toughy that's for sure\nwe've made it onto the lower slopes of\nthe Coen BG the infamous climb hopefully\nI've got something good left in the legs\nAl I can see ahead of me there's people\nalready to the side pushing so hopefully\nI'll uh\nsurvive average gradient\n11% 550 m in length\nwith a maximum ramp of\n22% to be fair I'm enjoying this chunky\ngravel\nto I've made it this I got a beer hey\nthank\nyou my heart I can feel my heart beating\nin my chest I've got nice cold quite a\nmon and I tell you the great thing is\nlook at this down on my\nhandlebars I can just place that there\njust take a\nbreather enjoy the view I mean that\nthat's one thing I've enjoyed all the\nway around and\nuh oh better crack onto the top we got\njust under just under 3 km\num cheers\n[Applause]\nguys so the dust and gravel has\nsettled I'm very tired 120 km as a\nopposed to the 160 km I had planned but\num we'll we'll just brush past that fact\nit's been an incredible experience and I\ndo want to say thanks to Shimano for\nmaking this happen and it would appear\nthe grx group set is going to go back to\ngcn Mega base in working condition ready\nto take on whatever next challenge we\ncan throw at it and if you're asking\nyourself should you try any of these\ngravel events or maybe even flanders's\ngravel 100% yes you should it's been\ngreat to have\nall the experience all the people riding\ntogether everyone for their different\nreasons we've got all different bike\ntypes so would I recommend it 100% get\nout there and find your nearest gravel\nexperience and festival and just get\nstuck in and enjoy it right let me just\nshare some of the stats from my ride whe\nI've got these on my head unit here so\nI've got a ride time of 5 hours 52\nminutes 125 km average speed of 21.3 km\nan hour that's du to all that Rocky and\ngrally terrain we've got an elevation of\n1,750 M it was very hilly today and then\nan average temperature of 12\u00b0 cuz\nthankfully it warmed up in the afternoon\nand this route should you so wish to\nride it is going to be available on Kimo\nso you can head over there and check it\nout in fact all three of the routes are\navailable on Kut 801 120 and 160 if\nyou're feeling particularly Brave and\nwhile you're checking out the roots my\nactual ride from today is also going to\nbe a available to view
