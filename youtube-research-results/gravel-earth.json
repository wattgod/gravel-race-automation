      "transcript": "The gravel season is just beginning and\nthe drama is already unfolding.\nSometimes you need to be a little bit of\na [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] You need to play the game as\nwell. Our estim I belong here. Like why\nshould I not be here now? And the\nlessons I learned I will take them with\nme.\n[Music]\nI think there's just so many riders to\nwatch at the moment that you know if I\nwas the competitor I wouldn't only watch\nme out. There's some other guys I would\nrather watch to be honest. But uh yeah,\nmaybe I'll be a bit more watched, but I\nthink it's going to it's going to be\nfine anyway. It will be super\ninteresting to see where everyone's form\nis at kind of like the first gravel race\nof the season. So, I think we will\nactually see some people uh shine and\nsome maybe not shine that will later\nreally perform. Well, gravel is growing\nso quickly, especially on the women's\nside, that I think there are people that\nI haven't even heard of that are going\nto come out of the woodworks and be\namazing competitors.\nThe field is like 20 riders who can win\nthe race and uh another 100 of of strong\nriders, it will be a completely\ndifferent event.\nIt's really hard to say because you\nnever know how everyone comes back from\nuh from the first training\nbut I also didn't check the start list\nso I don't know who's all on there. If\nyou see how everyone is um taking this\nrace more and more serious and uh\ntraining already from October on like\nthe level is so high. I think sometimes\nit's even harder to win the first couple\nof races during the season than later on\nbecause everyone is fresh, everyone has\nmostly no injuries. So if they show up,\nthey are ready to uh yeah to race. We\nhave a legend like an Langa coming for\nSansal, a lady who has been my biggest\nuh goat. I have fan pictures with her\nwhen I was younger and I have never\nraced against her, but I've always\nlooked up to her. Um, and I had no clue\nwhat to expect. Um, but it's so crazy to\nhave these heroes and out of nowhere\nyou're on the start line with your hero.\nracing is really\naggressive. Um, so that's the main thing\nthat I noticed is very very dynamic,\nvery aggressive, um, very technical.\nYou look really strong.\nYou know who\nit looks\nriders from gravelcom, riders for\nmountain bike, riders from the road.\nWho's the favorite? Magnus back. Nobody\nknew about him. He's on the bike racing\nteam, but I don't think even his team\nknew about his form. So, just seeing him\non the first stage winning, it was a\nsurprise for everybody.\nUm, I think we all have a better\nunderstanding now that uh you can have\nfriendship uh off the bike and you have\nbusiness on the bike because at the end\nof the day, we all have sponsors behind.\nWe all want to perform. We all work\nreally hard.\nShe's very pissed with me as well. And\num yeah, sometimes you need to be a\nlittle bit of a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and you cannot\nalways you need to play the game as\nwell. I think we're all friends on the\nstart line, but then as soon as it\nstarts, it's like everyone's in it for\nthemselves. Um, I think we maybe as as\ngravel expands, you see a few more like\nteam tactics if it's Panama or Canyon,\nbut I think everyone's still out there\nfor themselves. And it's different when\nyou're racing, you're racing. But I\nthink it never hurts to be friendly with\npeople. And I think gravel is such a\nsmall world. And I think\nbeing friendly with people translates to\nfriendliness in a race doesn't\nnecessarily mean that at the end of the\nday you are friends. That's never the\ncase when it comes down to the end of a\nrace, but I think it doesn't hurt to be\nfriendly with people. But yeah, the main\nchange we see this year in Gravel, it's\njust it's gotten super professional.\nGravel started to be just friends going\ntogether, ex-professionals on the\nmountain bike or ex-professionals on the\nroad just wanting to have a good time.\nBut now it's just getting super\nprofessional. The brands, the sponsors,\nthey all want results. So at the end of\nthe day, it's a job and you want to do\nthe job really good. So we see friends\nriding together, but yeah, cheers and\nhappiness on the start line, but once\nthe gun goes off, it just warm and\neverybody by themselves.\nThank you. Like seriously.\n[Applause]\nNow it's time for the second stage of\nSorry.\nOh my god.\nWhen we saw Anika Langar sign up, I\nthink everybody had doubts. She's been\naway competition for so many years and\ndoing a job having a kid only 6 months\nafter. I did not I do not think anybody\nput her in the top of the of the list of\ntheir list. So just seeing her on the\nfirst stage riding she looked pretty\nstrong. But the exhibition she did on\nthe second day just escaping by\nkilometer 10 and winning by more than 10\nminutes with a kid and a job is just\nwhat she did is incredible. Now we have\nthe new generation like La Sophi. Really\nbig brands are betting for her like Rafa\nCanyon. Can she stand the pressure? I\ndon't know. Mentally, of course, you\nalways want to deliver the same or\nbetter. Um, but I also try to remind\nmyself that what I did last year was\njust always just trying to do my best.\nAnd I think when I just do my best,\neverything normally comes together. Um,\nwhen I overthink it or put the bar too\nhigh, it's hard to even reach your own\nexpectations. I think she's been pushing\nherself too much. She's been training a\nlot. She had a lot of falls. I think\nwe'll see a better Clara after, but I\nthink this was a tough one for her. So,\nI try just to not lower my expectations,\nbut just show up and and do my best and\nhope that it goes well.\nOkay.\nThe finale.\nIt was mentally and physically so so so\nso hard. Like just pushing pushing\npushing and not really knowing, you\nknow, where I were and what happened.\nUh so yeah, it was such a hard day out\nand I'm really relieved right now. I did\nnot believe that it could actually\nhappen, but it it did. So uh I felt\nreally good actually. I felt really\nreally strong out there and with this\nnew bike, this new team, uh I just feel\nso fast on the bike. So uh I'm very\nhappy. I'm very very happy.\nYeah, we tried.\nNo,\nI'm super.\nSo to take uh some races really as\nlearning opportunities and uh allow\nyourself to\num you know make mistakes without like\nbeing really tough on yourself. In the\nend, we're all humans and bad days\nhappen. I was behind my\nclass. I need a hug.\non the climb because it's so\nemotional. It's the first one. It's the\nfirst one.\nAnd I think I was stronger and uh I I\ngot away and I just emptied myself the\nlast 40 40k. So, really hard and and fun\nday. I was just hoping to to hold on the\nsecond place, but it was one of the\nhardest races I've ever done. I was so\nso hard. I was really nervous before\nthis weekend how I would be and if I\ncould compete with the best guys here,\nwhich I of course hoped to to do, but I\nwasn't sure. Um, so to win here gives\nmotivation to this to the season and\nhopefully I can come back for tracker\nand uh and do good results there. I\ndon't know exactly what we can expect,\nbut hopefully more victories and good\nresults and uh fun fundraising.\nNow we've seen the start of the season.\nNow we know where riders are. It was a\nsuper deep field, but with the results\nwith the top 10, we kind of know how the\nseason is going to go. The question is,\nare we going to see Simon Nordal and\nCatalina Megan on the top of the podium\nagain?\nI think we're going to see who chooses\nto go 100% professionally or can you do\na job maybe how I see myself in the\nfuture where where is my place in the\nworld because I do cycling. I also have\num a professional job outside of sport\nand then I I don't know where I want to\nbe. I know I know that I cannot continue\ndoing two things at the same time\nbecause I know that either one is like\nhigh and otherwise low. So that's I\nthink that's the question I would like\nto ask and I I would like to know the\nanswer. I don't know\nit proud of you.\nLast season was big and I it really\nhelped. But I think going into the\nseason believing a little bit more in\nshowing up at races like ready to race\nand believe that I had the ability to\nwin a race would have would have been\nbig. Um, and that's something I'm\ndefinitely working on for\n2025. But one of the names that we did\nnot know how I was going to perform and\nwe're really glad to see on the start\nline, it's Ian Slick. He had a really\nbad accident last year and we did not\nknow how he was gonna ride or perform or\ncompete if the fear of the crashing and\nthe accident will come. But I think he's\ngone a really good path. He's maybe not\npicking at the beginning of the season,\nbut the season is long. Yeah, last year\nI had a really [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] year with a hard\ncrest in May and it took a long time to\nrecover from that. Unbound is the most\nmost uh important race of the year and\nin 2022 I won that race and\num yeah I was really focused to to win\nit again and that's why I was all winter\nin Dior for 6 months.\nUh but then two weeks before I was\ntraining with Nikki Tariffsa Yasper and\non a long training\nride. Yeah. And um a car came the other\nway on a gravel road and we didn't\nexpect that because we were in the\nmiddle of nowhere and we were riding 2x\ntwo and I was left outside and yeah I\ncouldn't avoid the car and I yeah was uh\nyeah had collapsed head in the car and\num yeah it looked really really bad in\nthe beginning and um it looked like I\nwas sleep so they had to handle quickly\nBecause when you have brain damage and\nthere they there's no oxygen. Yeah. You\ncan have the rest of your life problems\nwith it. Yeah. After 2 weeks I Yeah. I\nit it I woke up and I don't know nothing\nabout the accident itself only by\nstories from uh the guys who were with\nme and now and the lessons I learned\nfrom it. Yeah. I will take them with me.\nYeah, that health is the most important\nthing in life. You you forget that as\ncyclist sometimes and yeah family and\nfriends you can always fall back on them\nand they are are there for you\nespecially family. Yeah, you you have to\nlearn to walk again and\ndo Yeah, that was really crazy. And\nenjoy the small things. But it yeah, in\nthe beginning I was happy with with\ndrinking a coffee with my granddad. But\nyeah, you always want more and more and\nmore. But yeah, you you have to be happy\nwith what you have and not what you\ndon't have.\nI guess I uh come from the road racing.\nUh so I have done 10 years on the like\nelite road racing and uh always on the\nside I've done a little bit of like\ngravel training in the winter. Difficult\nfor me to know what to expect before cuz\nit was everything in gravel is new to me\nand I came in I think as the only one on\nour team without a sponsor. Everything\nwas was by myself and then uh afterwards\nit was easier to plan find a sponsor. So\nnow I'm with Faxa and really happy about\nthat. Yeah, these new guys coming from\nthe road and um I've been a road\nprofessional myself for like I think\neight years which is long time ago now\nbut uh I know how the dynamic is how\nthey're reacting what they're most\nlikely to do and um as I said for me\nit's good that they're coming in they're\nraising the level and the higher level\nis good for me because I like hard races\nand in the last years was sometimes in\ngravel racing that you went fast for a\nbit and then everyone slowed down looked\nat each other and chilled and now it's\njust full gas all time, more attacks,\nmore dynamics, more tactics and um yeah,\nso I like it.\nNow we have the heels, the second big\nrace of the season. Top riders are going\nto see their faces again. It's such a\ndeep field and we knew that this race\ngonna be really hard but nobody knew\nwhat was coming.\nYeah, most of the time when I have a lot\nof fun and uh good friends around and I\nenjoy the racing then I also have the\ngood results. So,\nabsolute carnage, like insane. Um, and I\nthink the crazy part is that like it was\nfrom the start. Brutal. It was so crazy.\nUh, I don't remember when I raced\nsomething like that. Maybe never. It was\nso hard. It was like cyclross for almost\nlike 180k.\nAfter two days of non-stop rain, a race\ncan change so much. It's not just racing\nagainst each other. It's just a race\nagainst yourself. Even the straight line\nis technical. You have so much mud in\nyour bike that it just you have to take\ncare of the mechanicals. You don't have\nenough food because you plan for\nsomething different. So by kilometer\n100, it just became a race for survival.\nYeah. I mean I think a lot of us we were\nplanning our nutrition for like 6 6 and\n1/2 hours. I think it was like 7 and 1/2\nor maybe more. Nearly eight. Um, so\nyeah, I remember looking down and just\nbeing like cuz like I knew the field was\nso split up and like everyone would be\nin the same position running out of\nnutrition and stuff. So you kind of just\nhad to get on with it. Yeah.\nYou have to push everywhere because it's\nwet and you you slide all the time. I I\nI took off my glasses because you don't\nsee anymore. So my eyes are full with\nmud and a bit uh irritated. So uh yeah\nit's very hard but that makes it also a\nbig challenge in life.\nI blew up like 60k ago. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hell.\nWant to die. Sorry. And you shared this\nthis this adventure, this race with a\nreally high level of athletes. And\nprobably is one of the reason that that\nthis that this victory it's more\nspecial. Yeah. It makes it makes it feel\nnice. But obviously I don't actually\nknow who's here cuz you can't recognize\nanyone anymore. So you're just in groups\ngoing there's some guys here. No idea\nwho they are.\nThat's nice to that they already now\nhave the a really good result which I'm\nreally proud of. So uh yeah that's uh\nreally nice.\nIt was a like six hour secret.\nI saw the other guy uh it's also taking\nme to try and stay uh was a 700 kJ\ntoday 6 and a half hours the\nbike. That was really\ntough. That was really tough.\nFirst victory of Morgan Aguil. You could\nsee the excitement in her face. She's\nbeen looking for this victory for now a\ncouple of seasons. She's been doing the\nwork and today she was the warrior of\nthe day.\nIt was like the most insane thing I've\never done.\nI think the gravel series will be on on\nthe list of of many riders. So this year\nI expect really interesting fight for\nthe for the GC and it's also on on my\nlist. I really want to make it a\npriority and uh and go for the overloo\nthere.\nThe next big one, Draa. What can we\nexpect? Will it be the redemption of the\nwriters that haven't had the start they\nwanted it? Rob will come and he wants\nthe number one spot. Matia wants it.\nLachland is always good, especially when\nit goes longer. Um, I heard Paul Vosel\ndo the 360. Expect a lot of fireworks.\nEverybody's going to fight for that win.\nFor me, it's one of the biggest goals of\nthe season, but you will definitely see\nme back. There's of course unfinished\nbusiness, always some races where I've\nbeen feeling close to the win or closer\nto a better result, and I think I have\nsomething to come back for. I almost\nretired after the 360 last year because\nI knew that it was the most beautiful\nwin of my career and that stories like\nthis don't happen in cycling. I just I\nwant my redemption tracker this year.\nFor me, it could be uh not technical\nenough. He struck a 360 for you."

      "transcript": "Welcome to gravel earth series.\nOnce upon a time,\n&gt;&gt; I set out to tame a beast.\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to the first.\n&gt;&gt; Not just any beast. One that could\n[music] take the trails, roots, and\nbumps. I still feel smooth under me. I\nneeded comfort for those long days where\nthe sun burns hot and the top and the\ndust keeps rising.\nI needed speed, too. The kind that you\nfeel in your face that pushes through\nthe wind that makes the heat easier to\nbear. I tried many strong, wild,\nstubborn ones, but none [music] moved\nlike this one. Just like in\n&gt;&gt; Hello and welcome to the first dance of\nthe season. We are here in Sang Gregori\nready for La Santaval by the trackup.\nI'm Maya. I'll be your host today. And\nI'm uh here besides me is Emma Porter.\nShe'll be commentating on the women's\nside. And then we'll have Peter Statina\nfor the men's. Emma, we've seen them on\nthe start. What do you think?\n&gt;&gt; Oh, I'm super excited to see how this\nrace plays out. It's the standards\nraised every year. Um so in the last I\nthink this is the fourth time I've been\nSantal in 5 years and I've never seen\nlike rollers at the start line. uh team\nvans, there's a whole little village set\nup outside. The the level is it's it's\nhigh. Um we've got Olympians, we have\npro triathletes, we have an iron man\nrace winner at the start, we've extera\npros, uh world cup marathon winners.\nIt's it's that it's exciting. First\nstage, they have 120 kilometer to go\nwith more than 1,600 m of elevation.\nIt's been raining. This uh winter has\nbeen crazy around. We've had lots of\nrain. We've had lots of wind. The\nterrain is uh in rough conditions. So,\n&gt;&gt; it's muddy and it's cold. Well, it's not\ncold until you get wet, but uh it was\nmaybe 8\u00b0 riding out here this morning.\nUh it's going to get up to about 14\nCelsius, which is not particularly warm\nand the wind is going to pick up as we\n[music] go on. Um so, it's quite mild\nout there now in terms of the wind, but\nby the end of this the stage, it's going\nto be a little bit windier. It's going\nto be a bit tougher and they're going to\nbe probably covered in mud by the time\nthey come to the start line if\nyesterday's ride was anything to go by.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we see you can see them here on\nthe starts.\nIt was cold this morning as we said. Uh\nwe were seeing really nervous faces. Um\nserious faces as well. New teams\ndeveloping. It's even hard for us to\nrecognize them now in their new kit, new\nbikes. It'll take [music] us a bit to\nget used to. Here we see G on the new\nSpecialized off-road team that I'm\nreally interesting to see that.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it'll be cool to see how they they\nrace together. They're a little bit\neasier to spot in the red that stands\nout a bit more, but you can see there's\na lot of blue, green, kind of [music]\nbeigy brown colors in there. And like\nMaya said, we're we're seeing new kits,\nnew teams, and so it's going to take a\nminute or two to or a couple of seconds\neach time to figure out who's who in the\nbunch as we see the stream come up later\non. Um, but the specialized guys stand\nout. So, it'll be interesting to see how\nthey race together or if they race\ntogether. They presume they're going to\nrace together. That's the general idea\nfor them.\n&gt;&gt; Here we have the starting of the woman.\nIt's really packed. We have Karen Megan,\nMorgan Aguire, Jerichos, Anah Langar,\nSophie Wright, Danish Rosie, Lucy\nHamstead, Axel uh Duval Pot, Sophia\nGomez, Vijaf, and Clara Sophie. So,\nyeah. Uh, Deep Field, more than 70 pro\nwomen. Uh, you've won this uh, race\nbefore.\n&gt;&gt; No, no, no, not you. [laughter]\n&gt;&gt; No, no. Uh, I think I was second twice,\nbut it was a very different race then.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's what I was going to tell\nyou. I've never seen people doing\nrollers 1 minute before the start.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, it's it's a big\nstep up. Um, but it's always it's a\nstrange race because it's very early in\nthe season. It's I mean, it's the what?\nIt's the 14th of February. Um, and okay,\nthere have been one or two races and\nokay, so Nicole Frame, we might expect\nto ride quite well because they've come\nfrom Australia where the season is it's\nkind of a normal time for them to be\nriding strong. Um, but for everyone\nelse, you can see they're nervous. It's\nthe like the rustbuster. Um, you can you\ncan hear the disc brakes in the\nbackground there cuz it is damp. Um, but\nwe're hearing of uh athletes whose bikes\narrived last night uh 9:00 p.m. last\nnight. That's that's a tough start um to\nbe out there racing um on a bike that\narrived at 9:00 last night.\n&gt;&gt; Well, yeah, I don't want to be in that\nspot. It's always the first of the\nseason. You need to test everything, see\nhow it works. The clothing, even like\nthe specialized off-road team, they got\ntheir bikes a week ago and then they're\nlike, I think everybody's testing their\nequipment, testing their clothing,\ntesting their team, how everything\nworks. Like even for us is the first of\nthe season so [laughter] we're testing\nhow everything works. But yeah, we're\nexcited for for this event. We see some\nserious faces,\n&gt;&gt; very serious faces there. But this is uh\nlike those first like maybe 5 10k are\nkind of some of the most nerve-wracking\nuh in this race in particular because\neveryone is excited, nervous. Um\nprobably more on the nervous side than\nthe excited side if the kid is new and\nyou haven't raced yet this year. Um, so\nit can just feel a little bit kind of\ntouchy on the way out, but as it splits\nup, they'll settle in nicely.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they have 15 to 18 kilometers of\nroad rolling roads to just um get\neverybody in their position before the\ngravel starts. So, yeah, it could feel I\nremember this part feels like a road\nrace.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Oh, big time. Um, but I think we\nwe already saw Excel putting in a little\ndig on the road to split it up. I mean,\nyou know, why why not with 115k to go to\njust split up the grip a little bit? Uh\nmaybe not the worst idea before they hit\nthe grapple trails either. So\n&gt;&gt; yeah, it would be interesting to see.\nAre the teams going to work together? Is\nspecialists going to work together?\n&gt;&gt; I think they will. I mean if um so there\nwas an interview with Mads um with the\nRoadman podcast a few weeks ago and he\nwas saying like the general idea for\nthem is for Specializ is to win as many\nraces as possible. So why wouldn't they\nwork together? Um, I imagine they're all\nbeing paid quite well to be there and\nwork together and Specializ is very much\nwin bike races to sell bikes and it's a\npretty strong team. I can't see them.\nWhy wouldn't they work together? But\nthen again, Anakah Langad won last\nyear's stage two by 10 minutes on her\nown. So maybe maybe we could see\nsomething like that and they might not\nneed to work together.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, some of the riders have done this\nrace. It's been their home race for a\nlong time. And then we see Sophia here.\nher first time doing Santaval two days\nstage race.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we'll we'll see.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. And Canyon DT Swiss have uh said\nthey're they plan to work together as\nwell. Uh I spoke with Yada briefly and\nsaid, \"Yeah, the idea is that they will\nwork together, but then also they\nthey're very much of the opinion that so\nthey're, you know, we're easing\nourselves into the season and uh yeah,\neveryone has a little thing at the\nbeginning. Oh, I was sick in January and\nthat's normal.\" But uh so everyone is\ndefinitely nervous. But uh no, it'll be\ninteresting.\n&gt;&gt; And as we were saying, it's like it's\nbeen a harsh winter in Europe. So\ntraining hasn't been that easy. Usually\nin Spain, it's cold, but it's sunny and\nthen the training goes pretty well. But\nin Girona, December, February, and\nJanuary, it's just been wet. So [music]\n&gt;&gt; yeah, no, it was very Irish conditions\nin Jerona this year.\n&gt;&gt; So yeah, hopefully the weather starts\nchanging. We see we're going zooming\ninto Jurona, the capital of the gravel.\nAll right, they're definitely at the\nmoment.\nSo, we see we're seeing here the the\ntrack for today. The start it's it's\nSagregori. It's a little town, really\ncute little town, really near Jonah,\nless than 5k away. So, I'll go out, get\na bit on the mountains, come down again,\nuh do some river crossings that, uh\ngoing to be interesting, and then they\ngo to the famous climb of the Gavaras.\nThis is a long one. I think the race is\ngoing to uh get cut here. Then they come\ndown again to a bit of the flats, up and\ndown, up and down. But with the terrain\nso broken, it's going to be an\ninteresting one. Yeah,\n&gt;&gt; they have the fit zone as well where\nthey they only have one fit zone that\nthey can get assistance from. So,\nworking with the teams and tactics is\ngoing to be uh pretty good to see. They\ngo up in the mountains again, a bit of\nups and downs. And then they go to the\nriver, parallel to the river,\nConstantine, and back to San Gregori.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, great. They're going out as far as\nConstantine. They're not crossing where\nwe did yesterday. No.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. I think they're crossing where\nwe did yesterday. Yeah. Oh, cold feet\ncoming in\n&gt;&gt; because the organization has been\nworking on the track. As we said, it's\nbeen really rainy. We had uh bad wind,\nso it's been cutting off trees that had\nfallen. Uh building bridges that had\ngone away. So, yeah, it's been uh pretty\nhard work from the organization to make\nthis track work.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, even the difference\nyesterday when we did that river\ncrossing was it was completely different\nthan it was a week ago. I went out there\na week ago and I was like, there's no\nway they can leave this in the race. It\nwas it was knee deep in places. I just\nturned around and went a different way\nhome. I was like, \"No, I'm not doing\nthat.\"\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; And usually that part is like champagne\nprobably. It's just super fast. Is the\nis the end of track as well. So this\nrace could be a pretty good test for\ntrack\n&gt;&gt; for the riders, for the teams. And uh\nyeah, I think it's going to for today\nit's finishes on that river crossing.\nIt's just what less than 8k from here.\nYeah.\n&gt;&gt; And I think if a little group is there,\nsomebody's going to try to attack you.\nBut I mean, if you mess up that river\ncrossing, if you try and ride it and\nyou're not up for it, or if you try and\nride it and don't take the right line,\nit could leave you outside of a group\nthat's coming in together. So, it's uh\nit's definitely a technical feature\ntowards the end that could decide the\nrace for for the front group.\n&gt;&gt; We're seeing them here in the first part\nof the course doing that road parts that\ncan work a bit more like road tactics.\nIt can, but it's also um okay, they're\ncoming downhill here, but around that\narea, some of the climbs are a bit of a\nshock to the system early on. Um I\nremember doing this 2 years ago now and\nthere was it was a bit of a yeah, the\nrace went here and the front group was\nkind of decided as before we got to the\ndescent in Lamata. Um and then there was\nanother small break from there, but it's\nit's not an easy climb despite it being\non the road. Um, so it's kind of nice\nthat it breaks it up a little bit for\nthem before they hit the trails,\nespecially this early on in the year.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. And then, uh, just after they hit\nthe trails, they do that, um, climb that\nwill break things up as well. But then\nyou have the descent that good riders\ncan catch up a bit. That descent is\num it's one that like I've I've ridden I\nride it a couple of times a year and no\nmatter every time I ride it, I've never\nfelt like I've gotten my setup perfect\nfor it. Every time I come around it, the\ngravel is a different type of loose and\nI've never felt like I've had my tires\nperfect for it compared to the rest of\nthe course. So, it's Yeah, you want to\nreally be able to handle your bike\ncoming down there because if you hit the\ncorners wrong, it's you can just slide\nout so easily.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. hearing ah we've been here for the\nlast two three days and it's been\ninteresting to watch uh the riders\nchoose the tire with choose the tires\nchoose their gearing so I'm seeing a lot\nof 50s and that can tell you a lot I\nhave friends who've arrived out with\nthat um and then they in the mud and\nthen they they're not so sure they've\nmade the right decision so it'll be\nreally interesting to see cuz it's\ndefinitely it looks a little bit drier\nout there today but given that it rained\na lot yesterday I mean it might suit you\nearly on but later on it could be an\nentirely different entirely different\nsituation. So,\n&gt;&gt; and gearing wise as well, like I've seen\nthe 46 on the back, but I'll see the uh\n52 as well and then one chain ring, two\nchain rings.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, a lot of options at the moment.\nAnd that's the part we love about gravel\nnow to see just the different setups of\npeople. And I think uh it can help or it\ncan\n&gt;&gt; Oh, it can be. Yeah, it can decide your\nrace um entirely. I mean, my preference\nis I've got a 52 on the back. I can't\nimagine riding around Jono without it uh\nwith some of those climbs. But then if\nyou're on the flat and you don't have a\nbig enough front jing, it's\nyou're out as well. So, it's trying to\nget that balance. Um I think maybe a 40\non the front and 52 on the back could be\nperfect. But that's that's me. That's\nhow I ride. But um yeah, I don't know.\nIt's two by I like the idea of, but if\nyou got some mud in there. Uh I I've no\nI've been riding one bike for years that\nI would wouldn't change it at all. And\nthen we've seen a lot of riders with a\nhydration pack. That I think is key. Um\nit just makes life easier. I mean a\nbottle can bounce out. Um but you can\nalso put your carbs in there and it just\nmakes your nutrition strategy that much\neasier if you can drink your carbs as\nyou go. Um also if you're riding on\nsomething slightly more technical, you\ncan just put the um the straw in your\nmouth rather than reaching down for a\nbottle. Um, but if you lose a bottle as\nwell, that can change your race. So, if\nyou have the hydration pack and you know\nthat your carbs are in it, it's it's\njust one less thing to think about. But\nit is the extra weight on the opening\nclimbs.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, as we were saying, there are water\npoints, but only in one eight station\nthey can be helped out by the external\nassistance of their team or friends. So,\ntactics on food and drink is pretty key.\n&gt;&gt; It's a long way to get there if\nsomething goes wrong ahead of it.\nAnd then also the change in temperatures\nbecause I think it's at the start 3\u00b0 in\nthe morning and then it can get to 15 16\nduring the day I think.\nSorry I met someone else on the line\nthere. Um I think it was maybe 7 riding\nout this morning and it's supposed to\nget to 1415 by the end of the the race\ntoday. But it's\nit's not a huge jump, but I think\ntomorrow I looked at it um online it was\nsaying like a low of minus 2 or\nsomething on the way out, but that was 2\ndays ago. So changed since then, but up\nto 17 and that's a huge difference.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that can be different day.\nAnd then I mean the status vary for some\nof the riders as well. Some of them have\ngreat team support and some of them are\nkind of out here on their own. And while\nthey might have support behind the\nscenes, when they get to the race day,\nthey might have a friend and it's like,\nokay, I'm riding out and I'll meet you\nout there and will you bring a bag, will\nyou carry this, will you carry that? And\nit's trying to bring everything to the\nfinish as well. And have hopefully have\nsomeone there who couldn't mind it for\nyou. And if you're riding out from town\nand it's zero, you want a lot of layers,\nbut then where do you put them if you\ndon't have someone to pick them up?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they do have um here you can\nleave.\n&gt;&gt; Okay. Yes. Well, I should know that, but\n[laughter]\n&gt;&gt; no other organization works on that. It\nknows that mainly I think 80% of the\nriders just ride from Durona. Yeah. So\nbecause the majority are staying around\nthere or houses over there and then\neverybody rides to warm up and then they\ncan't leave. Uh there's stuff here\nthat's really helpful also because when\nyou finish you're so hot and then you\nwant to change quickly and ride back.\n&gt;&gt; You're hot but then you're cold again.\nIf you hang around for too long. Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; In a minute you get cold. So it's really\nimportant to have something quickly to\nchange. And because as we said it's two\nstages of Santa Val. First stage 120k\nand the second stage is uh less than\n90k.\n&gt;&gt; Do you miss the hill climb there was a\nyear there were three stages.\n&gt;&gt; I do I did like it. The only things like\num I would have liked it to start one by\none. I think when we started as a group\nit was like I was way going way faster\nthan I should have and then when the\nhill came I was like wow. It was just\nlike a slap in my face, you know.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. I didn't miss racing.\n&gt;&gt; That was a tough season opener. Ouch.\nThat was\n&gt;&gt; But I was talking to someone last week\nand we were saying, \"Wouldn't it be cool\nif it was a stage three?\"\n&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. I I would like\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. If you had to race the first two\nstages and then it came down to seconds\nand you had to do the hill climb at the\nend, that could be\n&gt;&gt; But would you do it in the afternoon?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Knowing everyone would hang around\nand it would make sure everyone had to\nstay for the very finish. I mean, most\npeople do, but\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. It's great atmosphere here. It's\nuh that I'm no longer racing. I can hit\nthese ideas, you know.\n&gt;&gt; Somebody's going to kill you.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [laughter]\n&gt;&gt; I think Gerard is higher up their list.\nSo, um\n&gt;&gt; No, but the venue around is super nice\nto see. It's like a party when you're\naround. You have coffee, you have\nbreakfast in the morning before you\nstart. So, you can come here and have\nbreakfast and then when you arrive, you\nhave lunch. It's like proper Spanish\nmeal and you even have beers and\naquarius. And yeah, it's just people\nlove staying here.\n&gt;&gt; No, it's a great atmosphere. It's a and\nracing in Jonah is always super nice and\ncast do a really good job of that.\nAlthough I know a lot of people who are\nthis morning at 6:00 a.m. or 5:00 a.m.\ngetting up to have breakfast questioning\ntheir life decisions. But I know in the\nafternoon they'll be much happier.\nAgreed. And then you have a bit of lunch\nhere after the stage. You go back shower\nand then maybe just collapse in the sofa\nto prepare for the next day.\n&gt;&gt; Here on our screen we see Cara Dixon.\nThis is uh good to see. She's an like\nultra rider,\n&gt;&gt; but she's been choosing these races\nmaybe to get some speed in the legs.\nIt's nice to see different disciplines\nhere.\n&gt;&gt; Girls coming from the road, from the\ntrack, from the mountain bike and yeah,\ninto gravel\n&gt;&gt; from triathlon in andera. And we have a\nworld winter triathlon champion on the\nstart list as well. 2021 a winter\ntriathon involves skis and\n&gt;&gt; skate ski um mountain biking on the snow\nand\n&gt;&gt; we have a speed skater as well and and a\npro snow um skateboarder.\nYeah. Um I have her name here. I did\nhave her name. I wrote it down.\n&gt;&gt; A woman\nJosie I think.\n&gt;&gt; Josie Lori\n&gt;&gt; I think. Yeah. I'm 99% sure that Yeah.\nformer pro skateboarder with gravel. So\nyeah, it's a it's a real weird mix of\nstuff. And I think I saw a former pro\nfencer on the start list too, uh, Palish\nMiddle, Austria. So yeah, it's it's a\nmix of talent. Um, it's going to be cool\nto see how they all how they all work\ntogether or work against each other.\nWe're seeing images here from earlier\ntoday. They're still on the road.\nSo at this point, they've done 7\nkilometers. There's still a big pack.\nAnd um we thought this was going to\nhappen. I think this the break will\nstart um around kilometer 48. That's\nwhen the steep hill climb comes like\n&gt;&gt; I think the model might break it up a\nlittle bit as well earlier on.\n&gt;&gt; We'll do a bit of cleaning, but I don't\nthink it's going to be a small group.\n&gt;&gt; No, definitely not this time. No, this\nis the the most stacked I've ever seen\nin the start list.\n&gt;&gt; Me, too. I'm happy I'm here [laughter]\nand not racing at the moment.\nSo yeah, first time we do the live\nstreaming for Santaval. Look at this\nbeautiful drone images. This is our\nlittle city and our little uh play\nplayground.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, the Gavara is like what a place to\nride gravel.\n&gt;&gt; You can get lost in Gavaras and then\njust just amazing.\nI mean like those are some very obvious\ntracks there, but uh there are so many\nlike little single tracks that just turn\noff left, right, and center and you\ncould really get lost.\n&gt;&gt; Yes. When you go there by the weekends,\nthere's so many people on mountain\nbikes, kids, uh people running. Yeah,\nit's a playground and Catalans love\ntheir outside um activity. So,\n&gt;&gt; a bit of wildlife around there as well.\n&gt;&gt; Oh yeah, wild horse. I've seen a couple.\n&gt;&gt; And there's a few deer. I I had the\nmisfortune of walking a few dogs\nrecently and coming across a couple of\ndeer.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, I've never seen that. Lucky.\n&gt;&gt; Well, I was unlucky that morning.\n[clears throat]\n&gt;&gt; This is a gravel a bit of gravel part we\nwere talking about.\nIt's really important to be [music] well\npositioned. It's pretty rocky. I've\nnever seen a so rocky because of all the\nrain. Just a lot of puddles. So, you\nwant to be in the front. You see\nsomebody just hopping that puddle.\nNever know how deep they are.\n&gt;&gt; No, it's any of like anyone's guess\nreally. It could just be rollover or you\ncould just hit the front wheel in and\ngame over very early on.\n&gt;&gt; Is that Anaka or Sophia?\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I think I can really tell her from\nthis point, but\nAna's not doing Cape Epic this year. So\nmaybe her form last year she was doing\nKepic so she had to be really good form\nand uh yeah she\n&gt;&gt; that was an understatement for last year\n&gt;&gt; she just went\n&gt;&gt; this could be Claraara in the front or\nDanny\n&gt;&gt; I thought Danny had a black jersey on\nbut maybe that was a jacket at the start\nline\n&gt;&gt; it's even hard for the motor riders to\nkeep up with the woman going down these\ndescents are pretty we see Anka Anka's\nriding with Danish national champion.\nShe is of course so uh that was Sophia\nin the front.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, someone off a bike there.\n&gt;&gt; That's what we were saying. It's so\nimportant to be well positioned. This is\nthe climb. This is the one before the\nmot that we were saying.\n&gt;&gt; It's you do a left corner and then it's\npretty steep up. I was uh riding the\nother day the course with G and she had\nI think a 48 on the front and she was\nstruggling. I was\n&gt;&gt; 48 on the front is is a lot though.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think she changed but Oh yeah,\nlook we have a bit of a\npush. Sophia and\n&gt;&gt; I can't quite tell who that is. Oh,\nRosa. It could be Rosa.\n&gt;&gt; It looks like her bike in her kit. But\n&gt;&gt; that's what we were saying. Uh,\neverybody's changed their clothing, so\nit's a bit hard on the first one of the\nseason to recognize the the people,\nbut we'll we'll get there.\n&gt;&gt; I think this could be a really good\nbattle between these two for the the day\nas well if this is how it's going to\nplay out.\n&gt;&gt; And they already had the battle in Traa\n200, remember?\n&gt;&gt; I know. But then it's bit vengeance\nthere, is there? turn.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a good tactic. We see here\nhaving some problems. It's uh I think\nthey put loose gravel on the top of this\nclimb as well. So, it's pretty once\nyou're down of the bike, it's really\nhard to get up again.\n&gt;&gt; No, I remember I I remember this one.\nAnd if you don't get the if you don't\nget it right, you've just got to run to\nthe top. It's it's not enjoyable. Um and\nif you don't know it, you don't know\nwhich side to take.\nSo now we are going to see live images\nfrom this moment. You can see [music] on\nyour screen the groups who's riding\ntogether. We were right.\n&gt;&gt; Oh no, that's Morgan. Morgan and Sophia\nit says and the league group. Morgan\nAgira.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. [music]\n&gt;&gt; And Sophia. So not not Rosa.\nUh followed by Sophie Wright. And then\n[music] the chasing group is local and\n&gt;&gt; wow pretty pretty early in the stage to\nbe doing these moves. Do you think it's\ngoing to be a decisive move?\n&gt;&gt; I think Morgan and Sophia are strong\nenough [music] that if they if they're\nwilling to work together\nuh or if so uh if Sophie Wright bridges\nto them and the three can work together,\nI think they could stay away. Um\ncould not not will.\nUm, Morgan's just off the back of an\naltitude camp in Colombia. She said she\nwas like, she said she felt good, but\nalso that she wasn't really too sure\nwhat to expect. Um,\n&gt;&gt; is Sophia doing Cape Epic? I hadn't\nlooked at that.\n&gt;&gt; No. Okay.\n&gt;&gt; I don't think this year.\n&gt;&gt; They're uh really committing to gravel.\nThey have a good mix of races and uh\nthey're I think that all all the\nspecialized team will stay here and go\nnext week to another race in Spain and\ntake advantage that they're here and\nthen fly some fly back to the US.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, cool.\n&gt;&gt; So, I think they have a pretty packed\ncalendar.\n&gt;&gt; As we were saying, there's puddles,\npuddles, puddles, a lot of water.\nThey'll have their feet wet since the\nbeginning.\nI don't know about you, but it took me a\nhalf an hour to warm up yesterday after\nthat river crossing. And that sorry,\nhalf an hour after I got home, not not\nhalf an hour afterwards.\n&gt;&gt; I think I haven't been um Yeah, I need\nto go to some tropical place. I need the\nwarm. [laughter]\nI'm not a winter person. So, yeah.\nHaven't burned up in uh a month.\n&gt;&gt; No, the winter here this year was was\nnot uh it was a little bit unforgiving.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Hopefully, we have we've had a lot\nof water, so I think the spring is going\nto be spectacular. And I'm hoping for\nTraa to be warm and uh and sunny. Oh, I\nhope so. I hope that's the end of it. I\nthink people are saying that that is the\nend of it. It's supposed to get warmer\nfrom now on. I really hope they're\nright.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, this is your front group, Sophia,\nMorgan,\nand um\n&gt;&gt; Sophie, right? kind of chasing in no\nman's land in between them and a chase\ngroup.\nUm so Sophie was second at European\nGravel Championships. Um she's former\nworld tour rider. Um she had a really\ngood season last year on for her first\nkind of proper gravel year.\nIs there a third rider in there on the\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think so.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; But I still don't know who\n&gt;&gt; Oh, that could be Rosa then. That's who\nwe thought it was initi um on the climb.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. So that's that group is strong\nenough that it could stay away.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, those three for sure. And then\nRosa is pretty good on the flat because\nthere's this they now they arrived to\nthe flat parts uh parallel to Medina to\nthe road and this is just like\npretty flat, a bit tactical because\nthere's a lot of puddles around. But\nthese three riders know this part.\n&gt;&gt; It's going to be sticky and muddy in\nthere in places. So, Rosa closer, Morgan\nAguire, and Sophia Gomez Via on the\nfront.\n&gt;&gt; That kit already looks a lot different\nthan it did 20 minutes ago.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. I never I don't ever think\nit's white is a good idea for Bravo.\nUnless you have one jersey for every\nevent. I can never take the mod out of\nthe jerseys.\n&gt;&gt; No, we had one white jersey a few years\nago and we wore it once and it was\ndestroyed. I know it looks uh elegant,\nbut I don't think white is good for\ngravel.\n&gt;&gt; White shoes, white socks. No, no, no.\n&gt;&gt; I can hear cold play in the background.\nThe men's race must be getting ready to\nstart.\n&gt;&gt; Yes. So, ooh, 3 minutes to the start of\nthe men 270\npro men.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, that start list is insane.\n&gt;&gt; I think it's the gravel worlds, maybe.\n&gt;&gt; The February World Championships.\nWorld Championships. We see uh we're\nhearing now uh Gerard with his famous\nspeech on the start.\n&gt;&gt; Today is your day.\n&gt;&gt; Today is the day.\n&gt;&gt; You were saying he practices that in the\ncar sometimes.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; He puts the music full gas and then he\n[laughter] sends us videos like with\nthat trying to motivate uh the staff and\nmotivate us to Yeah. This it's been\nincredible to be part of this family,\nthe Glasmark family. Uh,\nso yeah, we have Gerard uh taking care\nof all the tracks, then Christina uh\nmaking everything happen. We have a\nreally big team. So, yeah, taking care\nof the riders, the people.\n&gt;&gt; So, how do you think I know uh Peter's\ngoing to come on shortly and do some\nmore commentary, but how do you think\nthe men's race is going to go?\n&gt;&gt; Uh oh, here they're coming to the first\nriver crossing. Remember this one? Let's\nsee who goes in there. I think everybody\nwill go in the river, but yeah. See,\npretty deep because we had the rain\n&gt;&gt; today. You have to take care of your\nmaterial as well. But two weeks ago Oh,\nthere goes Yeah.\nWell, the good news is Sophie Wright\nisn't far behind. If she can't bridge\nback up, there will be there will be two\nof them. But even two weeks ago, those\nstones those stepping stones were\ncompletely covered as well. So, the\nlevel has gone down. But on the other\nhand, the trails have absorbed a lot of\nit, so they actually they do feel slower\nto ride.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it was pretty fine 3 4 days ago,\nbut as we were saying, we had all day\nrain yesterday. It didn't rain really\nhard, but it rained all day. And yeah,\nthat's going to interot the conditions\nof the track.\nAnd you were saying uh for the men, o\nthat's I think the woman it's easier to\npredict, but the men I don't know\nbecause I need to see a lot of pro\nriders coming that I don't know their\nform in gravel. Uh but I'm really keen\nto see Keegan. How good does Keegan do\nhere? He's never raced Santaval. He's\nnever raced in I think gravel in Spain.\nSo yeah, good to see. We're seeing them\npass here in front of us. Oh, I'm\nnervous.\n&gt;&gt; So, who do you think is going to\n&gt;&gt; for the men's side? I don't know. The\nmen's, it's\n&gt;&gt; it's so hard to tell with the men. I\nmean, the women, okay, there's we have a\nlist here of like 60 women and\nit's still hard to tell, but there are\npeople who are maybe more obvious\ncontenders, but in the men's it's 200\nand something names or 270 names. And\nokay, Specializ are going to race as a\nteam. Apparently, Canyon are going to\nrace as a team, but um if you look at\nfactor, if they could race as a team\nlike uh Peter Vakok and Roman dear uh\nPday, like I was they were both um\nwithin a minute or two of each other at\nthe sea otter. So,\nif they work together, mountain bikers,\nI'm really keen to see mountain bikers.\nM there's a yeah\n&gt;&gt; wild Tan last [music] Rancho he he did\ngreat and he just raced last weekend in\num\n&gt;&gt; and a mountain bike event and he did I\nthink he played [music] second so I\nthink this course really suits mountain\nbikers as it is. No, it's going to be\nYeah, I don't know. I wouldn't like to\nbe picking the winner of that or\n[laughter] I'm glad Peter's coming in\nshortly. I'm going to be doing the bulk\nof the commentary on that. I mean, you\nwant to talk about the women's race? I\nknow all about that. But yeah, you can\nsee in the screen uh Morgan Aguire\nuh Sophia Gomez and Ra closer on the\nfront. We see chasing group of Jer\nSophie right in the middle.\nMorgan has she's kind of bridged back\nup, but I hope that effort hasn't cost\nher too much. Uh, at least it's a flat\narea so she hasn't destroyed or burnt\ntoo many matches to catch them again.\nBut it's not like that those like that's\nkind of a sandy mud. It's a bit deeper.\nIt's sticky. Like you feel the pull on\nyour tires. It's uh it it feels slow to\nride through.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they've been racing already for an\nhour. They have 90 km to go. Still the\nbig climb that everybody\nuh\neither loves it or hates it. So,\n&gt;&gt; which one were you?\n&gt;&gt; I hate that one. It's like once you turn\nleft and see that steep, the first part\nis the steep uh tarmac. It's like, oh my\ngod,\n&gt;&gt; oh, it's never a good sign when you see\ntarmac in a gravel race on a climb. It's\n&gt;&gt; And then it keeps going, keeps going and\nthen Yeah. for me. O, always hard to get\nthere.\nSee Rosa here leading the front group.\nSophia just back of her and Morgan just\nreached back. The thing with Rosa is um\nlike she's an incredible rider, but I\nmean even when we saw at the World\nChampionships last year, she was doing\nthis incredibly long turn. Um it's she's\nstrong enough, but also I don't know if\nmaybe she's she does too much work\nsometimes earlier on.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think she's she's in a great\nform. She's been training with Canyon\nRoad team. Hm. Yeah, I think she was\nmight have been one of the first riders\nwhose gravel career got her into a world\ntour team. So, that's it's a very\nimpressive thing. Um, starting to see a\nlittle bit more of that, but not a huge\namount. Like Excel this year has gone\nwith EF. Um, or maybe they're they're\npro on the women's side rather than\nWorld Tour. But, um, it's it's rare that\na gravel career gets you into a road\nteam.\n&gt;&gt; G did a fair bit of races last year with\nS Works. Now she's uh 100% with a\noff-road specialized team, but she did\ntwo years with the road\n&gt;&gt; as well.\nSo I think tutor gravel uh tutor are one\nof the first road teams to have a gravel\nsetup within their road team. One of the\nfirst pro ones like I know we've had\nteams that have pro or sorry we've got\nteams that have riders who will ride\nboth. Um but shooter have actually got\num a gravel setup on their like as a\nside to their So we've got um\noh\nyeah who was second in the track at 360\nuh and Clara Coppenberg I think it was\n&gt;&gt; coming from the road. So yeah it's\npretty interesting structure. Uh\n&gt;&gt; we've seen Jan in a couple of Traveler\nSeries events. He's done really well. He\nwas uh yeah good to see on the track\n360. He was enjoying.\nYeah, you were saying Rosa giving a fair\nbit of pulling on the front.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, she's still on the front and and\nSophia is smart enough that she will\njust let her do that.\n&gt;&gt; Um\nbut it's good to see Morgan's gotten\nback on there and if if she can play it\nsmart, she's another chance as well. She\nwas um\nsecond to Ashley Pullman\nuh two years ago, I think it was. Oh\nyeah. Mhm.\n&gt;&gt; She had a really good ride. That was\nkind of her breakout season.\n&gt;&gt; Mhm.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. She's always tried and uh two\nyears ago in Santal. Yeah, I remember.\nShe That's where Yeah.\nRemember this part? They're just going\nto\n&gt;&gt; I remember all of it. I've just it's\nlike flashbacks and I'm but it's the\nsound that I can hear of the the fact\nthat it's muddy and I can hear that it's\nslower and\nand I'm so\nyeah where we were saying this is the\nriver crossing. We have one uh of our\nstaff there. Carla is going to go live\nto show us how this river crossing is.\nHello Carla.\nHola.\n&gt;&gt; Hello Maya Ka here. I'm in the river\ncrossing kilometer 30. As you can see,\nall the photographers are ready. So also\nI'm going to show you\nthe river. It's a long one because it\nstarts there and then they cross through\nhere and go to this other section.\nYeah, I'm gonna show you. I'm running\nbecause it's so long. [laughter]\nSo, the other section is here, as you\ncan see,\n&gt;&gt; like long, long, long river crossing.\nIt's insane.\nWow.\n&gt;&gt; I'm impressed that you're out there,\nCarla, because I remember yesterday you\nwere you did not want to be out out in\nthe other river crossing.\nYeah, this is what we were talking\nabout. It's been uh really rainy. The\nrivers,\nthey have been grown a lot and we had to\nthe staff has been building uh bridges\nto make this happen. So\n&gt;&gt; yeah, I mean what we rode yesterday was\nso different even a week ago, but when\nwe we had a women's ride for the Trackr\nforce yesterday and Carla was on it, but\nshe was very adamant that one side of\nit. Can I ride it before I before I\ncommit to walking it like you possibly\ncan, but you've got to nail it and so\nshe came home with wet feet and was not\nhappy about that.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I I also tried, but no, couldn't\nmake it.\n&gt;&gt; You did a you did a better effort than\nmost people though. There were like\nreally big rocks in the middle. So\n&gt;&gt; yeah. Yeah, that was the problem is if\nyou don't hit them exactly how you\nshould, you're going to be wet from head\nto toe. So I wasn't risking it.\n&gt;&gt; Is that still Sophie right on chasing?\nIt's hard to read the screen from here.\n&gt;&gt; Yes. Yes, she's chasing. She's\n&gt;&gt; She's making a long day for herself or a\nlong weekend for herself to be out there\non her own kind of in no man's land.\n&gt;&gt; But what will you do?\n&gt;&gt; Stop and wait. No,\n&gt;&gt; it's better to try and push and\nsomething happens, you can reach into\nthem and then as we say, it's like the\nlong climb coming. She's a really good\nclimber. So,\n&gt;&gt; no, it's it's a really hard decision to\nmake when you're out there. Uh cuz you\nhave no idea how far anyone is behind\nyou. So, it's different to the road. No\none has a radio. Uh no one knows how far\naway anyone else is. Uh for all you\nknow, the chase pack is 30 seconds\nbehind you. And if you make one mistake,\nyou could be in it very easily. Um or\nthey could be they could pass you in in\n2 minutes. You don't know.\nWow. It's uh Rosa on her own, Sophia in\nthe middle, and Morgan trying to bridge\nback.\n&gt;&gt; Why not go for it with 87k to go?\n&gt;&gt; But it's the thing of gravel. It's so\nhard to ride on a group,\n&gt;&gt; especially like the conditions at the\nmoment. It's just so broken that maybe\nit's like I don't want to risk it. We\nsaw what happened to G last year on the\ntrack 360.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there is a benefit of riding a\ngroup. You do get a drop, but if there's\nany kind of wobble in front of you, it's\nit's not the same as the road because\nthe conditions are so different and\nsomeone could just make a small mistake\nand whether or not they come down, it\ncould cause you to come down, it could\ncause you to damage some of your\nequipment or yourself.\nBreaching back all together again.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, those conditions look rough. It's\njust And then for the material as well.\nSo much water, so much mud.\n&gt;&gt; I took my rope bike out this morning\nbecause I can hear all the grip in my\ndisc brakes. And um it was serviced\nyesterday, but before I rode it, it was\nbeautiful to ride to the group ride it\nto the group ride. And then by the time\nI got home, I could just hear [snorts]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's another thing here. The\nterrain around Jurona, it's it's muddy,\nbut it's sandy. So, it's the typical\nterrain that just goes through your\nbrakes.\n&gt;&gt; It goes through your kit. I mean, the\nstuff that like I hose myself off in the\nshower before I got into it yesterday.\nMy kit was just I was like, \"How is this\ninside of my\n&gt;&gt; You could hear the brakes. You could\nhear the brakes.\" We were saying that.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, you could hear them all even just\npulling out from Santa or from\nSangraori. There's just that that kind\nof symphony of high-pitched uh disc\nbrakes with the the sound of fear if\nyou're uh if you're a racer.\nYeah. Yeah. Yeah. This\nDo you think they're going to come in\nlooking like they did at the hills?\nI do think so. Maybe not as muddy\nbecause I This mod doesn't stick to your\nface. It's more\n&gt;&gt; sticks to everything else. [laughter]\nyour clothing.\n&gt;&gt; I'm uh I want to see Rosa closer skits\nwhen she I don't think you can.\n&gt;&gt; No, I want to see it tomorrow.\n&gt;&gt; Is it going to be white tomorrow?\n&gt;&gt; Oh, she'll have another one.\n&gt;&gt; I know she'll have another one, but I\nwant to know if if the mud comes out.\nLike, you can say what you want about\nthe pass kit being brown, but it it\nholds up well. I do agree. I like I like\nthat color. I like that kit. I'm not a\nfan of it, but in these conditions, I\nthink it would be\n&gt;&gt; I think I grew on it. Like that first\ntime I saw it, I don't know. I I don't\nthink I liked it, but now\n&gt;&gt; Well, I think it's good in terms of the\nbranding that they've stuck to it for\ntwo or three seasons now. So, it's it's\nthem whereas other teams have chopped\nand changed and okay, Ripple are still\nin a kind of bright pink. Um, but aside\nfrom them, every other team seems to\nhave changed a bit.\n&gt;&gt; You can see here the tricky condition.\nIt's so muddy. It's like uh like a cycle\ncross race. your bike is going one way,\nyou want it to go another way. Um, yeah,\n&gt;&gt; whatever about the racers, I'm equally\nimpressed with the guys on the motos who\naren't used to riding around in these\nconditions.\n&gt;&gt; They're pros. They've uh raced mountain\nbike uh the majority of our camera guys.\nSo, you have to be really skilled to be\nfollowing this events on uh on the moto\nwith the camera.\n&gt;&gt; I wonder how big that chase group is.\nIt's It's uh I'm using an uh is that\nClaraara's name? It's hard to\nto move. I need to wear my glasses\ntomorrow to read that.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's pretty.\n&gt;&gt; Or is it Clara Coffenberg\nand Nicole Fra is in that group. That's\na strong group as well. Um but I'd love\nto know if it's just the four riders or\nif there's if there's more in there cuz\nthe bigger it is, the the more likely\nthey are to catch them later on cuz they\ncan all climb all those riders.\nYeah, I think that climb is going to be\nreally decisive and uh in these\nconditions, the downhill as well. Yeah,\n&gt;&gt; I know uh really good riders that love\nthat descent and they're just going to\ngo and try to bridge.\nI thought it was going to be a bit more\nsunny today. I live in hope that it\nmight be.\nIt's always hard uh for me even like to\nrace when uh it's just like this moody\nlike it just changed my mood a bit. No,\neven like last week, Besano was on,\nwhich is a local race and a couple of of\nelite riders lined up for that just to\nkind of test their setup. But looking at\nsome of the footage and the like one of\nmy friends had a GoPro on out there and\nlooking at some of their photos and\nthings, it just the rain has changed\nchanged the terrain so much. And like\nwhile it looks just flat and muddy here,\nwhat it means later on on some of those\ndescents is that they've some of the\ntrails here have like quite big ruts.\nUm, and if they're flooded at all, it's\njust it becomes just this huge kind of\nundulating.\nBut across um across the trail rather\nthan undulating terrain, it's just\nthey're lumpy in the middle if you don't\nhit them right. It's it's not nice to\nride. Well, actually, it's a lot of fun\nto ride. It's not nice to race.\nI do agree. Uh it's going to be\ninteresting to see the riders coming\nfrom the road because the conditions of\nthis track at the moment are pretty\ntechnical.\nYeah, I've been curious to see how some\nof the Extera triathletes would ride. Um\nbecause of quite often they've got the\nengine. Um but the Exter have an engine,\nbut the Extereroa riders generally have\nthe skills as well. Um so I was curious\nto see how they'd get on, but I haven't\nseen we haven't seen any of their names\nyet in the in the chase group or in the\nleague group. So, might be a shock to\nthe system.\n&gt;&gt; Yes. And then it's I also think there's\nriders that like um do better in cold\nconditions and riders that do better in\nwarmer conditions.\n&gt;&gt; Like some people love racing in the mud.\nUm I don't enjoy it until I'm out in it\nand then it's I think it's actually\nquite a lot of fun to race in. But I'm\nnot sure.\n&gt;&gt; I love racing in the bud, but I hate\nracing in the Gulf. So my my body never\n&gt;&gt; if it's warm and muddy I'm I'm actually\nquite happy. But it's this is the kind\nof weather where your hands are cold\nyour feet are cold\nand for me once my hands are cold\n&gt;&gt; yeah tracker 100 last year we had this\nkind of conditions\n&gt;&gt; same conditions for that\n&gt;&gt; like a psycho girls race for 100k I\nloved it and it wasn't cold so for me it\nwas perfect\n&gt;&gt; I think a lot of people who had traveled\nfor it were a bit like what is this\nand having had sun the day before for\nthe other races. And it was so hot for\nthe 200. People were complaining about\nthat. So this is Jonah. It can change.\nThe conditions can change from one day\nto another. And you can see the\nprediction one week before and then the\nday before like, oh, but this rain\nwasn't predicted like a week ago. So it\nchanges so much. You have to bring all\nthe kind of kids.\n&gt;&gt; But even with the early morning starts,\nuh especially in like this time of year\nin February, it's it's cold and it does\nwarm up. Like so the temperature\ndifference can be 10 degrees different\nand tomorrow looks like it could be 15\ndegrees different between the start and\nthe finish.\n&gt;&gt; They'll arriving to the first water\npoint. Um I do not think any of the\nfront riders will stop.\n&gt;&gt; No,\nthey've been riding for an hour and 16\nminutes. They still have 84 kilometers\nto go. We're here in the leaderboard. Uh\nyou can see the gaps between the groups.\nIn the first group, uh Rosak closer,\nSophia Mia, and Morgan Aguiler.\nAnd that's Sophie Ride is just a minute\nand 40 behind if my my eyes are right\n&gt;&gt; And the change group again is maybe just\nunder 4 minutes. 3 3 and a half. Is that\n320 or 340? Uh 320. Okay, great.\n&gt;&gt; We have our screen pretty far away, so\n[gasps]\nit's complicated to see the exact\nnumbers, but yeah, it looks three uh\nminutes 20 to the third group.\nYou can see the change of terrain here.\nIt becomes it's still muddy, but it's\nmore a bit more rocky.\nNo, those conditions are tough. It makes\nit for a slower day and then a longer\nrace. And it's\nYou can see the way uh Morgan is\npedaling. She pedals a bit then stand\nups for a bit. Bike moves a lot.\nMorgan's gotten a long way ahead because\nat the beginning, I remember two years\nago, she struggled a lot with technical\nstuff and now she's worked on that and\nuh she's pretty pretty good rider.\nYeah, she's come a long way and even in\nthe last year I know she said she'd been\nworking with a sports psychologist as\nwell because she she's always been able\nto produce the power. Um and then maybe\ntwo or three years ago it was more some\nof the technical stuff she would have\nstruggled with. Um I think there was a\nyear it was maybe 3 years ago I think I\ndropped her at something slightly\ntechnical and she never forgave me for\nit. Um she came back with a vengeance a\nyear later. So, well, we're seeing the\nthe river crossing here where Carla\nshowed us. Uh Sophia has decided to come\ndown the bike.\nUh we'll see what the\ntwo others decide to do.\nOh, everybody's running. Oh, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, that is really deep.\n&gt;&gt; O\nWhoa.\nYou can hear their emotions.\nOh, I have to be cold. The water that\nI'm just thinking about Christmas Day in\nIreland. There's a bit of a tradition of\ngetting in the sea. Um, so we did that\nthis year. Um, I feel like the thought\nof doing 80k on the bike after something\nlike that is it wouldn't appeal to me.\ncan see the image here from the top.\nUh, I've been reading there haven't been\nthat much water in Catalunia the last 40\nyears.\nSo, yeah,\n&gt;&gt; I believe it.\n&gt;&gt; It's been a lot.\n&gt;&gt; I mean, did you see some of the\nOh, nearly missed or Sophia nearly\nturned off the wrong way there by the\nlooks of it.\nDid you see any of the footage of um oh\nwhat's it called the behind Azor where\nthe waterfall is?\n&gt;&gt; Oh yes\n&gt;&gt; that was\n&gt;&gt; no even like in Dona we almost got\nflooded.\n&gt;&gt; Okay we're going to see the first\nchasers now.\n&gt;&gt; We have stuffy right.\nYou can hear their their brakes. Oh,\nSophie's deciding to ride it\ninitially.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, there we go. Yeah, [laughter]\n&gt;&gt; good decision. Any idea who that is with\nher? I can't I can't make it out.\n&gt;&gt; No, I can't see a number either.\n&gt;&gt; Good. Good to have somebody working with\nyou.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Oh, big time. That makes it much\neasier for her. I was wondering what\nshe's like out there on her own\nwondering how far they are behind her or\nhow far you have to go in front. Um, so\nit's it's very different to the road\nwhere you've got a race radio and a\nguest in the car telling you, \"Oh,\nyou've only got this far or just ease\nup. There's someone a group coming\nbehind you. You might as well just save\nthe matches for later or tomorrow.\"\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you can see the change in terrain\nnow from the road. They started big\ngravel climb then uh uh narrower.\n&gt;&gt; But that's what makes uh riding gravel\nin Jonah so much fun is that the terrain\nchanges so much. Um I went to uh an\nevent in Morca 3 or four years ago and\nthere was an American guy there who'd\nbeen living in Morca and he said, \"Oh,\nJona gravel is easy.\" But it turns out\nhe'd been riding a road bike on the\nCarlet. So it's just it's champagne\ngravel. But\n&gt;&gt; he was not riding this.\nYou can hear the riders.\nI will be screaming. Yeah, for sure.\nI see the EF gloves. That must be XL.\nYeah, with the French national champs\njersey.\nThat tall\nI presume that's G on the left. Taller\nrider in the red. Yeah,\nI think that's Danny's behind her as\nwell.\nI know an unofficial alliance all the\ntime.\n&gt;&gt; They love riding with each other.\n&gt;&gt; Didn't expect the river to be that deep.\nI thought they would be able to ride.\nBut yeah, as uh it rained non-stop\nyesterday, so I haven't I haven't uh\nwrecked this part of the course in\nrecent times at all, but um several\npeople were like, \"Oh, well, the first\nriver crossing.\" And I was like, \"No, I\nI don't know where that river crossing\nis, but I think I've ridden it without\nthere being a river there.\"\n&gt;&gt; There was no river. Hasn't been a river\nfor years.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, friends of town, the first\nriver crossing. Like, there's only one.\nNo, no, apparently there's there's five.\nThere's not five. But\nback on the road here again. Is that\nMorgan dropping off again or\n&gt;&gt; No, that's the camera guy.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, okay.\n&gt;&gt; He's chasing now. We're uh the camera is\non the drone, but you could see uh the\ncamera guy on the\n&gt;&gt; I presume he's on any bike.\nebikes. It's a good mix of ebikes and\nmotor cycles.\n&gt;&gt; Sophia, yeah, good point to start\ndrinking and seeing your nutrition\ngravel. It's super difficult to eat on\nthe bike, especially with this\ncondition. So, have to take advantage of\nthe little roads you get to see. I was\nalways a fan of the hydration pack and\njust having the carbs mixed in. I just\nfound it that little bit easier. Um, and\nthen my Wahoo was set up to just say eat\nin bold capital letters every 20\nminutes.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a thing you forget and then\nuh Yeah, it could it could you could\nlose your legs because of that.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Bonking is never\ntough.\n&gt;&gt; Well, we've seen the on the yellow\nriders the new Meamo uh team that they\ncreated all women. So I'm excited to see\nthat going as well.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. So they had um three of them\nstarted last uh last weekend at Basano\nNina uh was it Teresa uh Lucy and Castia\nand I think uh Sarah Demar has gone to\nColombia to start her season down there.\nNo, it will be interesting to see how\nthe Mammo stuff plays out over the\nseason. I think um I think they might\nneed a couple of races to warm up. I\nknow they raced last weekend, but then I\nsaw Lucy getting a bike fit during the\nweek. So, I mean, it's hard to go out\nand race on a new bike and then then get\nit fit for you afterwards. So, it's\n&gt;&gt; She was struggling a bit with position.\nSo, it's good to to get it\n&gt;&gt; uh dialed. And uh as we were saying,\nit's the first big one of the season.\nEverybody's testing their material,\ntheir clothing, their bikes, their\ngearing. It's just a test. And I think a\nlot of the teams are testing uh the\ncourse material as well for for Tracka.\nNo. And then there's well I mean so I I\nspoke to Morgan briefly yesterday and\nshe said her bike her newer bike for\nthis season isn't arriving until March\nor April. So she's at least got last\nyear set up so she's familiar with it.\nUm whereas Martha was saying or Nico was\nsaying Martha's bike arrived last night\nat 9:00. So that's a tough turnaround to\nbe building your bike last night at 9:00\n[music] p.m. to be on it for 8 and an 8\na.m. start. I think it adds up to the\nnerves that you already have. So,\nespecially with this terrain because uh\nit gives a beating to all the material.\n&gt;&gt; If the bolts are not really tightened,\nif the gears are not working, if the\nbrakes are squeaking, definitely\nsqueaking.\n&gt;&gt; Wow, that river crossing. [laughter]\nIt's a deep one.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. The last time I rode this course,\nit was not a river there. So, it's it's\ncrazy to see how deep it is. Never mind\nthat it's one that there is water that\nthere, but two how deep it is.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. You never get bored in this uh\nkind of terrains. It's you go through\nlittle towns, you do jumping gravel that\nI don't think I'll see today. River\ncrossings, mountains, rocky gravel.\n&gt;&gt; No. The only champagne gravel they're\ngoing to see is riding home from\nSangreori to Chi.\n&gt;&gt; No. No. I rode it yesterday. It's not\nchipping gravel.\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's as close as they're gonna\nget.\n&gt;&gt; I think maybe better choosing the the\nroad going back home.\nSo, if you're just tuning in, we have\nMorgan Aguira Rosa closer and Sophia\nGomez Via on the front group.\nThey've got a minute sc 40 to Sophie\nWright who there is a second rider with\nSophie Wright, but I we haven't been\nable to get her name. uh as of yet. We\ndid see them do the river crossing\ntogether and then there's a chase pack\ncoming with um what was there maybe five\nor six riders in that?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Danny Rosby um Nicole Fra\nand Langbard. So a good chasing group as\n&gt;&gt; So they're 3 minutes back. It's hard to\nknow if maybe it'll be interesting to\nfind out afterwards if G and Anukica are\njust riding uh or you know are they\nsitting up like kind of protecting the\ngroup are protecting a little bit so\nthat the others aren't chasing or think\nso\n&gt;&gt; I do think so. Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; No, I think the team dynamic is going to\nbe um a game changer in the next 12\nmonths. I think we'll see more and more\nof it. Um especially the more successful\nSpecialized are, the more likely we are\nto see more teams next year.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we did the athletes presentation\nuh last night with there was more than\n25 teams, gravel teams and uh still a\nlot of privateeers as well that it's uh\nreally nice to see. But teams are\n&gt;&gt; teams are coming and they're not new.\nBut I think the team dynamic is\nchanging. Whereas like previously it's\nbeen even with us with Reverb, we had um\nwe had a few riders who were strong but\nmaybe we weren't really told like oh you\nguys have to ride for each other right\ntogether. Um I think Canyon DT Swiss\nsaid that they're they plan to ride\ntogether or well yada and Carolyn\ndefinitely do uh ride for each other.\nUm, but a lot of the time you see riders\nof varying abilities and they're they\nhave different attributes that the\nbrands are interested in. So someone\nmight have a bigger audience and appeal\nto more of an adventure um an adventure\naudience. So that might appeal to a\nbrand to have them on a team, but it's\nuh I think going forwards for the Gravel\nEarth series, especially the UCI races\nand maybe not so much in the Lifetime\nGrand Prix for the foreseeable road, but\nover here I think the team setup is\ngoing to change a bit. Um there'll be\nlucky more riders who are able to work\ntogether for each other and produce an\noverall result.\n&gt;&gt; I think I do think that's well.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. And then uh we have confirmation\nis Larissa Hardto from uh Canyon DT\nSwiss team. The one that's riding uh on\nthe second chase group.\n&gt;&gt; She's strong. She was ninth at um the\nUCI gravel world this uh last year. So\nshe is\n&gt;&gt; one very strong rider. Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So really strong chasing group. Do you\nthink they'll catch them?\nUm, I'm not too sure how Lissa climbs.\nUm, that course at Worlds last year\nwasn't really known as a climber's\ncourse, so it's hard to know what she\nclimbs like based off that result. Um,\nand I haven't looked into all of her\nresults. Um,\nso if her and Sophie do climb well,\nthere's a chance they could bridge\nacross, but\nthese three can climb well and they know\ntheir area. They know the course. Well,\nokay. Sophia doesn't know it as well as\nRosa and Morgan, but Morgan and Rosa,\nthey know like the back of their hand.\nUm, they do climb well. They could stay\naway.\nI don't think the chase group is going\nto bridge back up, but or the sorry, the\nchase group behind them will bridge back\nup, but Sophie and uh, Larissa, they're\na bit of a maybe.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I do agree. Uh, Rosa and Morgan,\nit's their backyard, so they know every\nstone to the limits. And um, and they\nride together a lot. And Sophia has been\nhere for a week as well. And I know the\nteam's been reckoning the course. So\nmaybe she doesn't know it to perfection,\nbut she knows it pretty well.\n&gt;&gt; Well, she would definitely know it as\nwell. So she would have told her what to\nwatch for and you know where to be\ncareful or and where to send it.\n&gt;&gt; We're soon going to go uh and see the\nmen. Uh thank you, Emma.\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me. I'll see you\ntomorrow as well and uh thanks for your\ninsights.\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for having me and enjoy the\nrest of it. I'm looking forward to\nseeing how it goes.\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm going to hand over to Peter in a\nminute.\nHello. Uh hello, Peter.\n&gt;&gt; Howdy. Thanks for having me.\n&gt;&gt; No, thank you. I'm here with Peter\nStatina. Lucky to have him around. Uh\nhow have you seen the athletes? Because\nyou've been in the starting uh of the\nmen.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh I was here at the start\nwatching all the nerves. Uh, I'll be\nhonest, it was a little weird being on\nthe outside the barriers for once. Um,\nbut yeah, you can it was infectious. You\ncould feel the uh energy and the the\nnerves. It's that open seasoner. [music]\nUm,\nyeah. And it was cold.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's nerve-wracking as well to see\nthem from the back. I I still get\nnervous. It's like you get the when you\nwas like five, four, you're like, ah.\nIt's just different kind of [music]\nnervousness. But\n&gt;&gt; yeah, exactly. Exactly. We actually had\na little issue with the uh one of the\nriders uh Canyon Shrimm setups or sorry\nthe Canyon DT Swiss, the new Canyon\nteam. Um yeah, we had to pull a last\nminute little fix for one of them. So it\nwas already some of that hype and start\nlive nervous energy, but uh I'm sure he\ngot a little adrenaline boost right\nbefore the start.\n&gt;&gt; We're going to get to see that start of\nthe event. It's always nerve-wracking.\nAnd I we I we were saying with Emma, uh\ngetting your\nsetup dialed, your bikes dialed, it just\nit adds a bit of nervousness. No.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Especially, you know, no one's\nraced for quite a few months now and\neveryone's on, not everyone, but many\nriders are on new equipment. So, uh you\nknow, it's this nervous energy where you\nwant to show yourself and start off on a\ngood foot, but you also want to get\neverything dialed and set up. Um and\nit's also been interesting. I know a lot\nof riders have had uh uh delays due to\nthe the industry, you know, has been\njust um everything's coming together uh\nfor almost every team, but it's always\nbeen just a little slow on delivery. So,\nI think a lot of riders are dealing with\nnew equipment and last minute stuff. So,\n&gt;&gt; yeah, a lot of the bike lounges are\nmeant for April, so we see a lot of\nriders with bikes from uh last season.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\nGood good mix of uh of bikes of setups.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly. Um yeah, and so\nyeah, it's going to be interesting to\nsee uh kind of how it starts to shake\nout. You know, it's a new season and uh\nI heard you and Emma talking last night.\nYou know, it was uh very prevalent. It\nwas like a switch flipped. uh you know\nit was I think teams outnumbered\nprivateeers and it was pretty wild just\nto see uh it felt like a a noticeable\nand palpable shift uh within the space.\nIt was the team's presentation kind of\nfelt like the the road races the world\ntour road races I would do in the past\nyou know in front of everybody and there\nwas a there was a pretty rad crowd and\nseeing all the teams line up it was a a\nnew feeling felt like a different\naddition of gravel which uh I mean it\nwas exciting to watch. Yeah, it's\nchanged a lot now from when you started.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. No, it is. It has. Um and uh\nyeah, the race is always things evolve,\nthings morph. Um and [snorts] you know,\nI think we're seeing the continual\nprofessionalization of gravel. Um and\nit's clear that it's going towards uh\ntowards teams. And I think that's going\nto be something that we're really\nstarting to watch for here is um it\nwon't ever be road racing, but how do\nthose tactics play?\nBut I do think that uh tracks like this\none, like the one for for Santava that\nwe're seeing, it's so technical that you\ncannot like you can plan. Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; But the plan never goes accordingly\nbecause there's so many things that can\nhappen and can go wrong.\n&gt;&gt; That's Yeah, it's hard to like give a\nplan. It's hard for the teams like\nespecially road teams that are like so\nused to that and given water but here\nmaybe your uh son didn't get to the fit\nzone so you have to be prepared because\nif not it just kills your race so it's\nit's kind of you have to be a team but a\nprivateeer at the same uh time.\n&gt;&gt; Totally. I think gravel will always be\nuh relying on self-sufficiency. I mean\nthat's a core concept of surviving these\nraces. You know being able to handle\nyour equipment and yourself and and make\nit through adversity. That's a that's a\nbig part of this racing. It's not just\nstreamlined. Um, but you know, as far as\nthe teams, you know, one thing that I'm\npersonally going to be looking for today\nis uh I don't think you can come with\njust like a a guaranteed team leader and\na bunch of domestics, per se, like the\nroad, you know, I think it's going to be\nmore like we're\npowering numbers and it's going to be\nyou you see how we get through the or\nhow a team would get through the chaos.\nUm and and then you kind of take stock\nonce the selections have been formed and\nthen I think you can start to manipulate\nuh the tactics with numbers if you have\nenough riders left in the group. Um so\nthat's kind of where I see the team\nracing going. Um and then privateeers\nobviously have to be very um cy and\nsmart in how they dose their tactics.\nYou know, like if I were a privateier,\nI'd be watching Specialized, for\nexample, making sure if one of them are\nmoving, I'd have to be selective and\nmaking sure I go with one of those guys,\nwhether it was a Keegan or a Matiers or\nsomeone like that.\n&gt;&gt; And in the women's side, we've been uh\nwatching almost 1 hour and 40 minutes of\nracing. We have our two leaders here at\nthe moment, Sophie Mesafany and Rosa\ncloser. Uh what do you think the tactics\nof a road uh woman's side is?\n&gt;&gt; Um I think it's very similar. Um, you\nknow, Specialized are a pretty welloiled\nmachine. Uh, Sophia and Anukica have\nraced together a fair amount now. Um,\nand it looks like they've ditched Morgan\nand maybe she's just behind. We didn't\nreally catch where what happened to her,\ndid we?\n&gt;&gt; This is where they turn left and the\nsteep uh hill uh starts. And this is a\npretty long climb, so I don't know.\nSometimes it's wise to get your own\nrhythm. Then Morgan knows the downfield\npretty well. So I I don't know what\nhappened. It could be that or it could\njust there's really two strong riders.\nThey love going up. Sophia and Rosa,\n&gt;&gt; you know. I I think yeah, we're starting\nto see the the birth of a true rivalry\nbetween these two women. Um they've been\nheadto-head at Troa last year and many\nother races. Um you know, I was starting\nto think that because Morgan and Rosa\nare are such good friends that there\nwould probably be a little bit of an\nallegiance there. But it looks like\nSophia um she's the ultimate tactician\nand she is um very discerning in in how\nshe dissects her race and it looks like\nshe probably knew that she needed to\nstart to pair it down yet again.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's good to see uh the team\ncoming to the first travel earth uh\nseries uh the first race to Santaval.\nWe've seen them some of them on tracka\nlast year but it's nice they're\ncommitting for the whole series.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. No, it is. Yeah. And it's going to\nbe yeah, it'll be interesting to see how\nthe series begins to play out through\nthe the rest of the the season here. I\nthink we're going to really start to get\na lay of the land after this weekend and\ntake stock in in what the rest of the\nthe season's going to look like.\n&gt;&gt; You've raced a lot in America. Um what's\nthe difference between\n&gt;&gt; Oh gosh, [laughter]\n&gt;&gt; it's it's monumental, you know. Um,\nyou know, it's just it comes down to\nfor me even the geography and the\ntopography, you know, I think Oh, and\nhere we have uh looks like Morgan just\ntailing off the back. Um,\n&gt;&gt; 40 seconds it's saying up there.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, 45.\n&gt;&gt; So, yeah, we'll see if she can connect\non the downhill here. And maybe, you\nknow, we'll see. I mean, if I were Rosa,\nI'd be wondering she's she we're going\nto have to see how confident she's\nfeeling now, cuz does she want to charge\nalong with Sophia, or is she actually\ngoing to wait for for Morgan um and\nstart to open up the the possibilities\nof of the three the three-way tactics\nagain?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Because after the long descent\nthat they'll have uh from Gavaras, they\nhave a lot of flats to go.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And we'll also see um\nhow confident Sophia is and she um might\ntry to use the team excuse. Um I don't\nknow if she knows where G or um Anukica\nare, but that's going to be a big\nquestion too is uh does she actually\nstart sitting on and forcing Rosa to to\npull a bit more on the front using the\nteam excuse even if maybe it doesn't\nexist, but she knows how to uh play\npoker pretty well, which is uh it's it's\na it adds up. These small things add up\nin in these races, especially with so\nmany hills and twists and turns and\naccelerations.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think that's the thing that\nhappened at track 200 last year.\n&gt;&gt; It was Rosa pulling all the way because\nSophia was saying that her teammate was\non the back.\nOkay, now we're on the men's start. This\nis uh from earlier before. This started\n[music] at\n9.\n&gt;&gt; I'm sorry, there was a that's an\nYeah, and Spain, we've been getting this\nuh lately. So, they're telling us about\nthe strong winds that are coming. We\nknow there's a wind here called\nTraantana\n&gt;&gt; and we are having that today. So,\ninstead of\n&gt;&gt; All right, so we're going to have some\ncrosswind battles maybe out there.\n&gt;&gt; Oh my god. So,\n&gt;&gt; at what point do we think that the\ncourse opens up and there might be some\nexposure\n&gt;&gt; after the long descent?\n&gt;&gt; The women are just really maybe 15\nminutes away from that part. They'll get\nsome wind over there.\n&gt;&gt; All right. Um, yeah, I was seeing them\nall on the start. They were pretty keyed\nup. Um, you know, a big question for me\nis how Keegan is going to do with his\nhis new team. I think, you know, he's\none of the five-star favorites. And, um,\nthere's a lot of eyes on him with his\nteam change. Uh, he looks pretty lean.\nHe looked pretty locked in, although\nthat's always been his his his emmo. Um,\nand then, yeah, we have a whole bunch of\nother teams out there. or the the Canyon\nDT Swiss program is uh seven riders if\nI'm not mistaken on the start line. Um\nbut in the scent of all course,\n&gt;&gt; I don't think it lends itself to full-on\nteam tactics. I think it's it's too\ntwisty. It's like I mean I feel like\nwe're looking at a 4-hour cyclcross race\n&gt;&gt; Oh yeah. With these conditions, I agree.\nIt's uh any man um with themselves\nbecause\n&gt;&gt; It's a pretty tactical technical course.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And then we're seeing\nhere there's Oh, man. The uh this start\nlist. I mean, I think we should\n&gt;&gt; more than 270\npro men. You'll see them here.\n&gt;&gt; And the the star list quality, I mean,\nyou were sending this to me uh this week\nright before I I touched down here in\nSpain, and it was jaw-dropping. I mean,\nI think we're looking at uh one of the\ntop field qualities of of the whole year\nfor the first race of the year because I\nmean, this is the best riders that we\nwould see in the truck 200 and 300. I\nmean, the only thing we're missing is\nmaybe a few North Americans who are\nfocused mostly on the Lifetime Series,\nbut beyond that, like I mean, this is a\nwho's who of gravel racing. Um, so it's\nuh I mean we have Roman Barde here. We\nhave Mike Woods, the uh NSN premier tech\nuh tour stage winner.\n&gt;&gt; I know that mayor.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n&gt;&gt; Leon Sanchez. A lot of like road riders\ncoming.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Every year a few more guys\nuh catch the gravel itch. Um and it's uh\nit's interesting to see some of them\nsurvive and some of them thrive. Um so\nthat's always a big thing to look for.\nIt's not ever uh guaranteed that the\nengine just uh dictates gravel success,\nbut um yeah, I mean, you know, they have\nthe engine, but are they able to put all\nthe other pieces of the puzzle? Right\nnow, it seems like Roman Barde is he's\nalready got a win in Australia to start\noff his campaign. So, yeah,\n&gt;&gt; it's been a good course for him, I\nthink,\n&gt;&gt; like this one with a long climb.\n&gt;&gt; I won't be surprised if we see uh see\nhim in the front today.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, for sure. I agree 100%. Um he\nlooks pretty lean and and locked in as\nwell. Um\n&gt;&gt; you're seeing there the boogie with\nGerard. He's opening the stage. So it's\nneutralized till they make the turn left\nand they start going on the road. So\nthis is the caret. This is a via ver\nthat takes you from Jonat to San Gregori\nand they'll turn left and then the war\nbegins. We've been seeing everybody\ntrying to position there. This narrows a\nbit. So, you don't want to be stuck in\nthe middle.\n&gt;&gt; No, for sure. I mean, there it's RG\nbarging there. There's a lot of nerves.\nIt's cold. You're shivering and you're\nnervous. Um, it's going to be hard to\nkeep the bar straight this morning. Um,\nand then, yeah, again, once we open up,\nI think it's going to be very much a a\nwhole shot battle to that first climb in\nthe in the first dirt section. Um, you\nknow, fingers crossed that there's no\ncarnage. neutralized starts always\nstress me out because it's like I think\nyou just want to go like straight from\nthe from the gun, but when it's neutral,\nit's like the nerfs are there and\nthere's like everybody's trying to get\nahead of the car and you're like, \"Oh my\ngod, just please just let's go.\"\n&gt;&gt; I know. It's actually It's always It's\ncounterintuitive. It's just safer when\nit's strung out, you know? Um so\n&gt;&gt; thank you. [laughter]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's it gets pretty cold around\nhere. That's a a lot of people come to\nSpain. It's like, \"Oh, I thought it was\ngoing to be warm.\" No, but Jirona in the\nmorning, it's uh it's it's pretty cold.\nIt's humid, so it gets into your system.\n&gt;&gt; It's true. Yeah. Uh well, yeah. For\nthose who can't see, Maya's holding my\nhand and actually giving me her puffy\njacket, too. So,\n&gt;&gt; I'm the queen of puffy jackets. Yeah,\n&gt;&gt; I even take um uh Velocio has given me\nnow they've started with uh puffy\njackets and it's been my dream. I I\nalways have like a front biking in my\ngravel for front bag in my gravel and my\npuffy jacket's always there and people\nare like, \"Oh, you're super\nexaggerated.\" And then I take my puffy\njacket, I put it on and like, \"Ah, you\nwant it now?\" No. [laughter]\nSo, yeah, it it gets cold. Uh when it's\nsunny, it's fine, but if the sun doesn't\ncome out, it just it gets in your bones.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think it's supposed to be nice\nand warm by by this afternoon, but it is\nit was frigid on the start line this\nmorning, I show you. Um and it's also\nall the the cold puddles, you know, it's\njust frozen water and it's splashing up\non you and everything. So,\n&gt;&gt; yeah, we just saw the woman doing the\nriver crossing.\n&gt;&gt; Oh gosh,\n&gt;&gt; that was deep. Like I thought it wasn't\ngoing to be that deep because two three\ndays ago it wasn't that bad and yeah,\ntoday it's uh it's going to be a\nsurprise for the men as well.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. You know, and that's also always\nanother question we deal with is um do\nyou ride or do you run, you know, um cuz\nriding is almost always faster. Um it\ndepends a how deep it is, but also um\nyou know, you have to protect your\n[music] bike. I mean, even if it's\nfaster in the moment to to ride through\nit, if you get a bunch of mud and uh\ngunk up in your gears and it makes your\ndrivetrain more inefficient, then you're\ngoing to be pushing more watts the rest\nof the day. So, um a lot of the times\nit's the question on a how deep, but\nalso kind of how early or how late the\nthe river crossings are. So, have you\nseen anyone ride it this morning?\n&gt;&gt; Oh, somebody tried. No, they there.\nOkay. No, I think it's super I don't\nthink anybody will ride it. Uh we're\nhere on uh half part of your screen is\nSophie Gomez Vafany leading the woman\nand on the right we have the men. We're\njust seeing an attack. This is just the\nbeginning of the amen.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean we're Yeah, I mean it looks\nlike Sophia has actually gapped Rosa.\nThey're like right on her. Um can't tell\nwhere Rosa is if she's ahead yet or just\nbehind as we focused on the men's start.\nSo we should get a time check soon. uh\nthe men. I'm sure there's a few guys who\nwill just want to get ahead of the the\ncarnage early and maybe get a head start\nfor the climb. I think maybe we're\nalready starting to see team attacks. We\ncan't say yet who\n&gt;&gt; um I wouldn't be surprised if it's two\nriders from two different teams and then\nit's already starting that way.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we were predicting this [cheering]\nbecause as we saw with the women, the\nfirst 20k of the stage from today is\nroad. So there could be a lot of road\ntactics uh at the moment on the men's\nside, but once the gravel start is just\na different giant.\n&gt;&gt; Well, I mean this climb is absolutely\nbrutal, but uh man I mean Sophia must be\nfeeling confident that I mean we know\nshe's one of the best descenders a\nmountain bike background, but uh I mean\nthat's 74k to go. I mean they're not\neven halfway yet. So she's got a long\nsolo way. Um, if Rosa and Morgan can\nconnect, especially as the course opens\nup later in the day, then it might get\ninteresting again. So,\n&gt;&gt; but I I also think it's a good tactic.\nIf you feel strong on the climb, it's\ngood to go ahead because the descent is\npretty broken. So, then you can take\nyour time and then if they got you, you\nwork together and then if you go, but at\nleast you're like making your own rules.\n&gt;&gt; Yep. And it's also the the mental\nwarfare, right? I mean, she's already\nseems to be putting the other girls\nunder pressure and uh creating that that\nadvantage for herself there.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, she's making a she's making a\nstatement. No, I'm like,\n&gt;&gt; I came here to win and I'm going to try\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. You know, and I think that's maybe\none of the things that's uh left\nunchecked on Sophia's resume so far is\nthe the Graler Series title. So, I\nwouldn't be surprised if we see her\nstart to focus on that. She got Chaka\nlast year um but didn't end up making it\nto Rancho for the season final. So um I\nwonder if Specialized wants this feather\nin their cap.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're uh seeing her. This is a\nfamous climb in Jirona. She's climbing\nEl's Angels just a bit of the tarmac.\nIt's really hard to get a PR here.\nEverybody Everybody does this climb.\nIt's really near Jonah. It's 12 km\nclimb. But she won't do the whole climb\nnow. She'll turn right and hit the\ngravel again to get to the parallel the\nMongro's uh climb as well.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, I I know this too well. I have uh\nPTSD from having to race up and down Los\nAngeles in the Baltic Cataloonia a few\nyears ago in the wet coming down. Um and\neven actually, you know, when I was here\nracing road, um and gravel hadn't even\ntaken off yet, the one dirt connector we\nwould do on our road bikes with little\n23 mil tires was this right here between\nElangos and Montenegros. This was like\nthe little cheat code for some of us who\njust had to get off the tarmac once in a\nwhile. So, um I mean this is the iconic\nconnector, I think, between two of\nJerona's famous climbs.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, yes. Because Montos, it's a a good\nbroad climb as well that a lot of the\npro riders use. But the thing is, it\ndoesn't it's it ends on gravel. So, if\nyou have a gravel bike, you can uh do\nthis part of the track and then get to\nElsa.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly. Exactly. Um, yeah, there was a\na really good little restaurant on\nMonros uh that had a a little uh menu\ndela\n&gt;&gt; and it was like one of those little\nCatalon countryside uh kitchens. Um\n&gt;&gt; yeah,\n&gt;&gt; so for people that don't know the menu\ndia you get uh beverage first plate,\nsecond plate, desserts and coffee for\nlike 12 10 to 15.\n&gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Yeah. It's the the best deal\nand it's always the best home-cooked\ncuisine. Um, yeah, if you're going to go\nout one time a day, like don't do you do\nthe menu mcdia or menu delia and it's uh\nthe best deal you can think of. And\nusually there's a a beer or a glass of\nwine in there too if you want.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I love it. Yeah, you choose. They\ngive you a beverage and you can choose.\nSo yeah, you if you're around uh\nCatalunia or Spain, they have to do\nmenuia dur uh during the week. So yeah,\n&gt;&gt; it's a good choice. cuz you could go to\nreally good restaurants and and go and\ndo menu.\n&gt;&gt; Well, wow. I mean, we see Sophia taking\nliterally all of the road here, both\nsides. So, she's really opening it up.\nUm, and just she does not look like\nshe's conserving right now. That's for\nsure.\n&gt;&gt; No, this part of the track is still uh\npretty well conditioned. She'll fit some\nuh some point that it's really broken.\nSo, she's we can see her looking back to\nsee where Rosa is, where Morgan is.\nYeah, it looks like the trees are a\nlittle thinner here, so she might get\nsome good line of sight. Um, but yeah,\nI'm going to have to have you hold my\nhand in this. I have not been on the\ntrack actually. Um, so I am flying blind\nhere. It's part of the reason that I\ndefinitely didn't want to line up today\nbecause I have heard horror stories on\nhow complicated this route is. Um, you\nknow, and that's another thing with this\ncourse. It is um recon is everything.\nthe the uh terrain and the way that you\nride gravel in Jirona is just like a\nconstant maze. Um so I think local\nknowledge plays well and we actually all\njoke in the gravel space that uh Santa\nBald is the Jirona championships.\n&gt;&gt; Oh yeah, it's like a world championship.\nIt used to be our just warm-up event. I\nremember being 100 on the line and then\nthe next day we had the mountain bike\nevent as well. So, it was like a first\nopener of the season, but now it's like\nI've done it the last two years. It's\nlike, okay, I'm done. I'm not pro racing\nanymore because I don't train for this.\nAnd it's gotten too professional and\nthey go so fast.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. Yeah. I went to do the wrecky\nride the other day with uh Jerica, with\nuh Nicole Fra and with Danny Shrosby\nand even they were like just doing the\nride and I was like racing and it it's\npretty broken and it's really as you\nsaid it's really important to go if you\nhave the chance to do the the whole\nstage.\n&gt;&gt; Well, here we have the men and it's W\nAlamman, Matt Beers, Messor Schmidt,\nRoman Bardday and Dan So. Wow, that is a\nhigh power group. Uh it looks like\nSpecializ has stacked it with two of\ntheir three five-star favorites. Um so\nthis is this is significant. Um\n&gt;&gt; and as we were saying like having good\nmountain bike skills on this course how\nit is today, it's a pretty good\nadvantage.\n&gt;&gt; Definitely. Uh so I mean that's where I\nmean I know Matt Beers quite well. I\nconsider him a good friend and uh I mean\nthat guy is the total package and I\nthink he's going to thrive in in\nsituations and conditions like this. Um\nand it is looking quite soupy out there\ntoo. Um you know I the rain just kept\ncoming yesterday.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Non-stop. It just started like at\nnight and it did not stop the whole day.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. The course last weekend it was\npretty fine. like it was a bit broken\nbut wasn't that slow but today it's it's\njust [laughter]\n&gt;&gt; yeah so I think it's still quite early\nto have a um\na a time check and a true sense of how\nthe race is forming I mean we didn't\nreally see how that break ripped off\nthere um cuz they just it looks like\nthey just got off the pavement there\nrecently\n&gt;&gt; uh no this is just uh we're going live\nnow so\nThey've been riding for almost an hour.\nOkay.\n&gt;&gt; They're parallel to Medina. They're\nreally close to the crossing of the\nriver.\n&gt;&gt; So, maybe they'll show us where the\nbreak went, but they've already done the\nroad parts and then they did the climb,\nthe long climb to Lamont. Here we see\nMatt's words with the European Gravel\nChampionships jersey.\n&gt;&gt; It's a beautiful jersey.\n&gt;&gt; It's not going to be white.\n&gt;&gt; No. I I actually gave him some some\nflack on the starline for that. I said\nthat thing isn't going to look so pretty\nsoon. and he joked that he actually has\njust one he uses for training all the\ntime that gets nasty. So, he keeps the\nrest of them pretty and clean.\n&gt;&gt; I just saw the team that there were\ngiving him the jerseys and he has enough\nfor\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n&gt;&gt; so he'll be fine.\n&gt;&gt; I am glad to see uh this is my own uh my\nown bias, but I'm glad to see he's in\nblack shorts, especially if for the\noff-road disciplines. The the white\nshorts in the mud never no\n&gt;&gt; never go well. Freddy Oette always loves\ngoing white and I always at the start\nline like Freddy what are you doing but\nhe loves it. He does a lot of road and\nhe just loves to be elegant but\n&gt;&gt; I think whites of gravel for me it does\nnot work.\n&gt;&gt; No, no, no, no.\nYeah, it looks like I mean Mass is just\nkind of tail guning on the back. We'll\nsee if he starts to roll through or if\nit's already more that he's uh taken a\nbit of a leadership position and and\nMatt is going to be pushing the pace\nthere. So\n&gt;&gt; yeah, we were commentating with Emma\nthat it it's going to be interesting to\nsee the team tactics work.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, he doesn't look very motivated to\nfall through there. So that's already\ninteresting,\nbut it seem like they have a sizable\nenough gap. I mean, it doesn't look like\nthey're actually too concerned and\nlooking over their shoulders yet.\n&gt;&gt; Good size group. They can work together\non the flats, especially\nuh where you are tuning. Now, we just\ngot an alerts from the government that\nit's going to be a high w high winds\nday. So, you don't want to be by\nyourself on the flat that comes a bit\nafter the midpoint of the of the course\ntoday. Okay. Yeah. Well, yeah, that'll\nbe something to watch out for. Um, you\nknow, it's it's again it's even with the\nsize of that group right now, it's it's\nquite hard to mount a true chase. Um,\nbecause the nature of these roads again\nare so sineuous and twisty. It's it's\nnot like a big pelon. You can use more\nthan like six, seven guys anyway to have\nlike a proper rotation chopping off. So,\nthe fact that that breakaway is, you\nknow, sixish guys, give or take, um,\nthey're already pretty much using the\nmax you can fit on these little tracks.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. And look at the gaps they give.\nLike this, you're talking with the best\ngravel riders in the world at the\nmoment. And they're give but they're um\nthey're riding one meter behind each\nother. So, yes, you can tell it's pretty\nbroken terrain. You don't really want to\nbe on the wheel of the other rider\nbecause you want to see what's in front\nof you. There's a lot of navigating\nbetween puddles. Uh some points there's\na bit of broken parts that you have to\nhop uh up to. So\n&gt;&gt; you really take want to take care of\nyourself and your material uh especially\non the first stage at the beginning of\nthe first stage from today.\n&gt;&gt; That's a very good point. You know, I do\nremember the conditions feel they look\nvery similar to the 2024 TRAA that I I\nwon. And it was\n&gt;&gt; it was like this in the group where you\njust if if you were too you want to get\nthat ultimate draft, but if you're too\nclose, you're slamming potholes and also\njust the the puddles that just start to\nappear that you're not used to in recon.\nUm and you just end up using so much\nenergy, bunny hopping everything and\ntrying to stay efficient. Um it's\nactually more efficient to like you say,\ngive a bit of space there. Yeah, get a\nbit of a draft, have the eye on the\nother rider, but uh yeah, give some\nspace.\nThere's a lot to And I also think gravel\nyou have to be concentrated all the\ntime. It's not like road. Sometimes on\nthe road your head can switch off a bit\nfor a moment and then you can relax.\nThink gravel you have to be on top of it\nand then there's rocks, there's mud,\nthere's water. So\n&gt;&gt; it's pretty uh energy consuming. Like\nonce you finish a stage, you're like\nwhoa. Yeah, I think we're going to see a\nlot of empty faces at the finish line\ntoday. Um, and these stages, you know,\nthese aren't long, too. There's not\nreally marination time to settle in. I\nmean, these are we're talking what,\n120ks today, so we're guessing 4ish\nhours. And you know, I think these guys\nare just going to go full gas the whole\ntime. Um, and that's uh there's going to\nbe no rest. We already see them kind of\nmunching up there in some of the\nsections.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, especially this part we saw on the\nwoman. There's a lot of mud. They're\njust by the river. They're par they're\nriding parallel to the river. So, this\npart of the terrain is really muddy.\nIt's that mud that sticks a bit. Then\nafter they do the river crossing,\nthey'll go to more a bit more rocky\npart, but you see Mads here navigating\non the mud.\n&gt;&gt; Your bike goes somewhere. You're going\nanother way. It's just like psycho\ncross. You just try to pedal and uh ride\nthrough them.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. and looks like he's actually\nstruggling a little bit in the technical\nand the slop. Um, and this is where, you\nknow, you're really seeing the mountain\nbikers come to the four and um probably\ntrying to put pressure on him to force\nhim. They know he's got a big engine.\nUm, so, you know, if I were on the front\nhaving Matt's uh struggle in the mud, I\nwould be purposely sprinting out of\nthose corners to, you know, try I think\nthis race is going to be one with a\nbunch of uh dagger stabs instead of, you\nknow, uh, one big kill shot, so to\nspeak. Um, and I think that's what\nthey're already starting to do. It says\nis uh this is a trip far.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. And uh being cold, being wet all\nday. Ooh.\n&gt;&gt; All right. So, it's slick out there,\ntoo.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's what we were saying. It's\nimportant to see what's coming ahead.\nTake your own line.\n&gt;&gt; Problems with the bike.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. I couldn't tell there right real\nquick. Uh we invest in our own\nconversation if he went down on the drop\nside, but if he did, he might have just\njammed up his gears pretty good. But um\nthat looks pretty soupy. So um I mean\nthat spells doom. That was 40 seconds to\nthe chase group. I I think at this point\nhe's going to be reabsorbed by the chase\ngroup once he gets going. That's a long\nway to go by himself. Um it looks like\nhe's lost a good 20 seconds at least\nthere\n&gt;&gt; and a lot of energy.\n&gt;&gt; And a lot of energy.\n&gt;&gt; So we're going to see here the\nrepetition.\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah, he was on the drive side, so\nhe's got a whole bunch of stuff jammed\n[music] up in his gears, whether he lost\nhis chain or whether something was gked\nup or bent. Um, looks like he is riding\nagain, though.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, good thing he's he's riding the\n&gt;&gt; Oh, [laughter]\nit looks like the moto could also use\nsome better tires today. [laughter]\n&gt;&gt; They're rough conditions today out\nthere. So yeah, it's uh going to be\npretty tricky [laughter] tricky day for\neverybody around here.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, it's good he wasn't near the\nother riders when that happened. You\nknow, we've actually had motos go down\nin the felaton as gravel starts to\nevolve and the uh the coverage starts to\nto become more paramount.\n&gt;&gt; Oh yeah, you can see here the big group\nMagnus back. Uh he was the winner last\nyear for Santaval both stages. We talked\nto him uh yesterday. He was excited to\nstart the season. He loved this course.\nBut you're seeing on your screen, it's a\nreally rough conditions. Your material\nhas to be on point. Your form has to be\non point. And yeah, a lot of\nconcentration from everybody today.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is absolute chaos in the\nPelaton. Um, and it's Yeah, I think\nwe're going to get through this river\ncrossing up here and then we're going to\ntake stock and see what the situation\nis. This is right about where Mass went\ndown.\nYeah, you really need to choose your\nline. Try to get as much grass as you\ncan because it's where you have a bit\nmore grip. The mud, you never know what\nyour bike is going to do. And also, we\nwere saying that you never know how uh\ndeep the puddles are. See,\n&gt;&gt; this is true. This is absolute chaos.\nThat looks like tall Tobias Kongstead\nthere in the back struggling having to\ndabble a foot now. Um\nI know a few rider and okay throwing\nthrough the forest.\nI mean if there's no course tape and\nthere's a dry track I guess we're taking\nit. But you know I guess it's strength\nin numbers. So one rider can't be called\nout there.\n&gt;&gt; Look at the condition today is like a\npsycho cross race. We had track 100 last\nyear like this.\n&gt;&gt; Right. Okay, we have going through the\ntime check here. Um,\nyou know, it's going to be hard to get\nused to all the jersey colors,\nespecially with the mud. I'm trying to\npick out all the new colors and all the\nnew kit designs, and I tried to have a\npoint to look at it last night on the\nteam presentation.\n&gt;&gt; Thank god we have it here on the screen.\nSo, your leaders are Wood Alaman, uh,\nRoman,\nuh, I can see in the screen, Quaser, and\nDan Soete. So, oh yeah, pretty. So, it\nhas been really used to psycho crow, so\nperfect conditions.\n&gt;&gt; W and Dan, I mean, they are very good\ntechnical riders with a a pedigree\nthemselves. Um, and Roman Bard, I mean,\nhe needs no introduction. He's the I\nthink he was, you know, one of the race\nfavorites coming in. Um, and I am not\nfamiliar with Kaiser.\n&gt;&gt; Nope. Me German either. And that's the\ninteresting thing about gravel,\nespecially in Europe right now, is um\nyou know, I I know most of the riders in\nNorth America and you know, a lot of the\nthe main races here in Europe, but as\ngravel continues to boom, it's just this\nmelting pot and I feel like we're seeing\n50 names crop up every year of new\ntalent that's finding it. Um\n&gt;&gt; and a lot of young riders as well. It's\nalways hard for me the start of the\nseason because it's um you see new\nriders and youngsters like we have the\nSWAT team that's a lot of young guys uh\ncoming up and uh yeah it's good to see\nbut it's the first of the season. It's\nhard to know them and uh once we get to\nknow them. Yeah, I mean this is the\ncontinuation in that uh\nprofessionalization of gravel that we're\ntalking about is uh it's you know it was\nmy whole generation we were crossover\nriders coming from road coming from the\nmountain bike and now that gravel has\nbeen established for long enough we have\nriders whose first foray into the pro\nranks are as a gravel pro um you know I\nknow that with the the Canyon DT Swiss\nteam uh part of their roster is uh\nfocused on up and cominging talent\nrather then establish results and you\nknow Clausmark uh you guys just uh\nintroduced and brought up a\n&gt;&gt; tracker roots.\n&gt;&gt; So it's a program to get a youngster up\nin the professional. So we'll help him\nhim with material coaching. So yeah,\nit's a nice um thing that class is\ndoing.\n&gt;&gt; It'll be interesting to see how he lines\nup today in all of this. I mean he knows\nthe course better than many. He was\nsuper excited and it's nice to see your\nheroes know lining up with people you\nsee only in the TV and then you're\nracing with them and\n&gt;&gt; yeah, you can learn a lot from it.\n&gt;&gt; So here we have the chase group. Um that\npurple jersey there, the second from the\nback that is the new Canyon DT Swiss\n&gt;&gt; Big team, huh?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. 13 riders, men and women. Uh\nbut it's across all the disciplines\nactually, which is interesting. you\nknow, it's all the terrain, whether it's\nuh ultra, we have two ultra specific\nriders. Um, a couple established men and\nwomen, you know, Carolyn Schiff, yes,\nCleion, household names. Uh, and a very\ninternational focus, too. Um, so it'll\nbe interesting. There's never like a\none-sizefits-all with our team.\n&gt;&gt; Are you going to do uh adventure racing\nnow?\nYou know, part of me this uh I'm excited\nto see this race, but uh part of me um\none thing that as I start to transition\naway from my prodays is uh I would love\nto do the Choco 560 someday or the\nUnbound XL. I feel like a big part of\nGravel's soul is the Ultra, the\novernight, pushing through the night,\nfinding that limit physically. Um and\nthat's something as always focused on\nhigh power like these guys right now. Um\nyou know, I've kind of capped it at one\nday races. So, um maybe in my future,\nbut uh\nnot this year.\n&gt;&gt; Some races it's hard to see from like\nwhere we are and know like you want to\nbe there, you want to ride, but today,\nno, I'm fine. I'm fine here.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Now that I'm seeing the\ncourse, there was, you know, a little\nbit of that angst on the start line this\nmorning. I saw I know that feeling so\nwell from a career and seeing the\nshivers, the the anticipation on the\nstart line. It was weird being on the\nother side, but now that I'm seeing this\ncarnage, I am\nvery handy happy with uh borrowing your\npuppy jacket [music] in this booth.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, here on your screen, you have the\nlist.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so we had Matt [music] Beers\ntailed off just a little bit as well. Uh\nhe might have just hit with a hiccup\nthere. Um and then Matt Schmidt, Peter\nHavoc is in there. [music] Uh so that\nmain group is already 220 back. Um so\nthat front group is charging.\n&gt;&gt; Wow. Um and [music] it looks like\nthey're struggling. It's a big chase\ngroup. I mean, it's we're struggling to\nsee um maybe mounting a chase.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, big group.\n&gt;&gt; Chad in there. Hugo had a great start to\nthe season last weekend. [music] Um you\nknow, and interestingly enough, we don't\nsee Keegan in there anywhere yet.\n&gt;&gt; So, I wonder if he's dealt [music] with\na mishap out there.\n&gt;&gt; Okay. Or maybe the chip stop.\n&gt;&gt; This is true. This is always possible.\nYou'll we'll need to wait and see the\nimages to see if Geigan is still on the\non the race.\n&gt;&gt; Here they hitting a bit of the road\nwhere they can relax a bit, see how\nthey're doing, maybe get a bit of\nnutrition in their bodies.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, here we go.\n&gt;&gt; River crossing.\n&gt;&gt; We have guys on both sides. There's Ben\nPerry in the Canadian Champions jersey.\nHe's easy to spot no matter the\nconditions. He knows the course is\nreally\n&gt;&gt; just got married with a Mexican girl. So\n&gt;&gt; Oh, amazing.\nSo yeah, you see two different styles\nhere, two different tactics. You know,\nit looks like one like Ben, you know,\nhe's kind of mounting his bike cycle\nacross style earlier and predicting it.\nAnd then you see other guys just trying\nto run with it, but you're they're still\ngetting that that drivetrain all gked up\nthat way. So, um depends on how tired\nyou are, but uh I think mounting was\nprobably the right call there if you had\nto dismount anyway. If you ain't riding,\nI think you should protect that bike.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's uh really hard conditions\ntoday for the material.\n&gt;&gt; Yep. And then right up into a rough\ndouble track. I mean, Gerard loves to\nthrow everything at these riders at the\nmost unexpected. Um, it's well known as\nI started to do more and more classmark\nraces that, uh, gosh, it's just, you\nknow, there there's what makes sense and\nthen there's what Gerard makes the\nroute. Um, and it's it's always fun\nwhether you're going through a culvert\nor running through someone's field. Um,\nbut it never and it's actually in Cloud\nSmart Graces specifically where pavement\nis so welcome. I know.\n&gt;&gt; It's just like a a moment to\n&gt;&gt; and there's not never like never enough\npavement. He was like, \"Please give me\nmore.\" But yeah, every time I go and\nfilm uh when Gerard has done the course,\nI usually go and rewrite it and film\nsome parts. And I'm just thinking like,\nJerard, they're going to kill you.\n&gt;&gt; Especially last year when he added up\nthat little climb of the 360 before you\ngot into San Gregori. I think that was\nan extra climb that,\n&gt;&gt; you know, but I I rate it though because\nespecially as Gravel gets so so\ncompetitive and everyone is traveling\njust to recon and spending days riding\nevery inch of their track. Uh I think he\nhe enjoys kind of keeping a few secrets\nin his back pocket and then releasing\nthe uh final definitive course just in\nthe days before to throw a wrench in\neveryone's works. And and I think it's a\nnice way to really make sure that uh\nwell here we see uh Matt Beers has made\nit back on. So, that little 10-second\ngap was maybe just due to a chip or\ncoming off in the back of a corner or\nsomething. Um,\n&gt;&gt; we see Walt Alamman here. He did really\nwell at Rancho last year. He's a\nmountain biker, does uh some gravel and\nuh I think he's liking it.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. And Roman Barde looks calm, cool,\nand collected. I mean, he's he's dealt\nwith it all over a long career. So, he\nlooks comfortable. Um, and and I think\nif I were the other guys, I would be\nthinking, I mean, we have to put Roman\nunder pressure now or in the technical\nstuff, you know, especially with that\nbig climb to come that we saw Sophia\ngoing on. Um, and on that rough descent\nbecause, uh, man, if it just becomes a\nWatts race, I mean, Roman is, you got to\nsay, the fivestar favorite.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think my prediction is Roman\nwill go a bit ahead on the climb\n&gt;&gt; for sure. Um, you know, I I mean, he's\nbeen racing gravel for almost a whole\nyear now. Um, you know, he kind of left\nafter I believe the Doofine last year\nwas his final goodbye near home if I\ncan't if I'm not mistaken. Um, so you\nknow, and this was some, uh, something I\ndealt with in my transition was just, I\nmean, you can be a good bike handler and\nyou can ride well off-road, but um, at\nthe world class level, the 1% of the\n1enters, like I mean, Matt Beer, the way\nthat that guy goes down a mountain is\njust untouchable. So, um, I would expect\nthat if Matt is can keep near Roman on\nthat climb that he can easily reconnect\nwith him on the descent. I will close my\neyes the whole descent because it's so\nscary to watch from the motorcycles.\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\n&gt;&gt; it's scary how fast you go down.\n&gt;&gt; Here you can see on the screen the\ngroups that are chasing. So, bit of a\nbig gap in between the first group and\nthe second group.\n&gt;&gt; And we have Mashar Schmidt still kind of\nin no man's land. I mean, he lost a\nchunk of time with that mechanical, but\n&gt;&gt; I mean, I don't see him coming back with\na minute 10 gap unless he's with a solid\ngroup himself.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Also, if you know, only a few\nriders have the tracker. So, if you\ndon't see them in the chase groups, they\ncan still be there if they don't have a\ntracker. So, these are the\n&gt;&gt; chasing groups, the names that have the\ntracker on them.\nthat's good to know. So it does not mean\nthat Massware Schmidt for the viewers at\nhome is alone chasing solo. Um it is the\nMassware Schmidt group for lack of a\nbetter name right now.\n&gt;&gt; Yes. And then uh every few kilometers\nthey go through the chip uh connector\nand we get on the screen the timing\ndifference and then there you see almost\neverybody that uh is just has passed.\nSo, it looks like this is quite a long\nextended pavement section and now they\nare starting to go uphill, but you know,\nthey've kind of been biting their time\nand this was our uh our intermission, so\nto speak, before things really kick off\nagain. Um,\nwhat's coming up then for the rest of\nthe climb? How close are we to this uh\nthis tough climb?\n&gt;&gt; It's almost there.\n&gt;&gt; They'll have a bit of awakening it, a\nbit of uh descent, and then the big\nclimb. So, they are there.\n&gt;&gt; Mhm. You can see them looking around.\nDan Suete is looking back. Roman Bardet\nwas just in the front as we predicted.\nUh but Matt Beier is wants to have him\nreally close.\nHere we see a bit of a gap. Roman Bett.\nIt looks like the roads have not dried\nout at all this morning yet. Even the\npavement is wet.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Katona, especially the region\naround Jura, there's a lot of rivers, so\nit's pretty humid and mornings are\nusually really humid. uh training around\nhere where you're hitting roads and you\nknow it's winter. You have your winter\nroads and your summer roads because some\nof the roads here don't get any sun in\nthe winter and they're just like damped\nand you want to avoid those roads. We\nhave\n&gt;&gt; summer rides and then winter rides and\nthen they're a whole different world.\nWell, and that's the local knowledge\nwhere just that's I think what makes\nSavval\nso unique is it's\nit's the Jerona World Championships,\nright? So, [music] there's so many\nriders who live here and winter here\nthat um it always it's those little\nthings that add up to saving energy like\nknowing that this road or this thing\nwill be damp to be in the front at this\nmoment because this corner is always\nslick in the winter and these things.\nAnd this is why um riders who\nfrequent here are at such an advantage\non this course today and tomorrow.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. And the course today of like as\nyou were saying all the art courses you\nhave a bit of everything.\n&gt;&gt; So a little bit of tarmac today we saw a\nbit a bit more than he usually puts. But\nbecause being such a big field of men he\nwants to break it up a bit before the\ngravel starts because if not with uh 280\nmen it could be a bit dangerous. So he\ntries to uh break the the pack in the\nbeginning and then you have the long\nclimbs, the rocky descent, then the like\na lot of flats and then a bit of grass,\na bit of mud, a bit of river. So you\nnever get bored on courses like this.\n&gt;&gt; It's a true test and that's one of the\nbeauties of of modern gravel racing is\nthere's um everyone's going to be on the\nback foot sometime and everyone's going\nto have a strength at some point. Um\nit's uh I think today we'll see a true\njackof alltrades type of winner. Yeah.\nAnd with these conditions, you have to\nadapt.\n&gt;&gt; You have to adapt. Yep. A lot of it is\nuh damage control to be honest. It's\nsomething is going to go wrong in these\nconditions. It's almost guaranteed\nsomething will go wrong for every rider\ntoday. And it's the luck of when it\nhappens and how bad it is.\n&gt;&gt; I'm glad I'm sitting in this part of the\nscreen with you at the moment. We have\nEmma in the morning and you've joined\nme. Thank you for this. Uh\n&gt;&gt; yeah, thanks. Thanks for holding my hand\nthrough this. Um and as we see, we can\npeek out just outside. It looks like the\nsun is starting to creep out.\n&gt;&gt; Hopefully,\n&gt;&gt; I'm done with winter this year. It's\nbeen a a tough one around Catalunia. You\nsee the conditions now. And you can see\nour women's leader on the screen, Sophia\nGomez Via.\nShe's almost done with the climb. She's\nshe will start the long descent pretty\nsoon. And on the other side of the\nscreen, you could see the men bigger\ngroup riding together.\nSo, back to us. Thanks for joining us\ntoday. We are in the first dance of the\nGralard Series, Santaval 2day stage\nrace. First stage 120 kilometers, second\nstage less than 90 km with a lot of uh\nteams, a lot of new riders. So exciting\nto see something.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Short, spicy. We're seeing uh what\nriders did their homework coming out of\nwinter. What riders are just trying to\nget their their feet wet, so to speak.\n&gt;&gt; Um so yeah, it's uh there's a lot of\nthings to look for. Um a lot of nuance.\nI think a lot of riders are going to\ngoing to come out of here with um with\nnotes to take back before the next uh\nwhich is the next traveler series race?\n&gt;&gt; Uh the hills.\n&gt;&gt; The hills. Okay. And that is a big one.\nI mean, I know I was talking with Matia\nde Marquy uh last night, the team's\npresentation, and the the start list for\nthat is nearly as good as here. I think\neveryone is showing up to the hills as\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a good mix of uh races. We\nhave Santaal in February, the hills in\nMarch, then we have Gravel Desert in\nApril just before Traa. So, it's a good\npreparation for for the riders that are\ndoing Traa as well.\n&gt;&gt; I mean, look at these time gaps, Maya.\nThis is uh Sophia has just pried open\nwhat looks like nearly an insurmountable\nlead. Uh and Morgan is not far from Rosa\nand it again we don't know how big these\ngroups are. I mean I think it's safe to\nassume that uh the front three are all\nby themselves. So it's oneon-one which\nmeans Sophia is not at a disadvantage\nanymore. Um but these are just I think\nthis speaks to how bad these conditions\nare today. I mean, it is just minutes\nalready and 2 hours and 20 minutes of\nracing. Wow. This is uh I think this\nspeaks to the course today.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh we predicted something like\nthis is going to happen, but never like\nthis soon in the in the race.\n&gt;&gt; We thought groups were going to stay a\nbit closer together, but with this\nconditions on the track, it's just\nbrutal.\n&gt;&gt; Well, the one thing with gravel is you\nnever say never. I mean, the unexpected.\nThe only thing guaranteed is that the\nunexpected will happen and especially\nwith this being a stage race, right? And\nuh GC time over two stages. Um\nlooks like Sophie's on a good way right\nnow. You know, uh hoping that there's no\nbad luck, but uh she doesn't get to rest\neasy tonight.\n&gt;&gt; No, you know, 2 minutes can be nothing\nin gravel. That's a one one flat tire, a\nsidewall bite with a a hard to plug\npuncture and 2 minutes is gone. We saw\nRosa closer losing the European\nChampionships last year. She was winning\nby a big margin and then she had a\nmechanical she fell and then she almost\nhad to run to the finish on the last two\nof them. So\n&gt;&gt; yeah, that was heartbreaking to watch.\nUm I remember seeing clips of that and\nuh and in conditions like this, the\nmechanicals are just even more frequent.\nI mean the the mud covering rocks is\nthey just uh you can't even see them.\nAnd you never have it easy till the end.\nYou've won till you cross the finish\nline. No, I I remember just counting\nback the kilometers like, okay, just 2\nkm, maybe I can run 2 km if something\nhappens and then just trying to play\ntricks in your mind because Yeah, as you\nsay,\n&gt;&gt; it's true. It's true.\n&gt;&gt; Anything can happen.\n&gt;&gt; And it's hard in this new space, this\nendurance sport where, you know, we\ndon't have radios, you don't have\ninformation. I mean, Sophia is\neffectively riding blind. I don't think\nthese motos are able to give her time\nchecks. Uh\n&gt;&gt; no, they're not allowed.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. And but it's so it's, you know, a\nlittle mountain biky in that respect,\nbut these races are so much longer than\na mountain bike race.\n&gt;&gt; They do have uh she'll have some um\ninformation when she hits the eight\nstation where their um team is going to\nbe and she'll get information there.\n&gt;&gt; Maybe she relaxes a bit that she has a\nbit of time.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. and specialize. I mean, they are\none of the most uh organized and and uh\ndialed operationally. I'm sure they'll\nhave uh uh small army of of staff out\nthere to to be jumping around and do\ngiving as much information as possible.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they've been here for a week\nprepping Santaval. They rented a house\nby Sel. They have a cook, they have the\nmechanic, they have the manager, the\nwhole team. So, yeah, really\nprofessional. Yeah, it's a lot of teams\nare doing this. It was funny coming in\nto see just uh how many teams were doing\ntheir preseason camp and using Santal as\nas their first dance uh so to speak. And\num yeah, I mean Canyon BT Swiss is here.\nI saw Matia's team is here. The Ripple\nOutliers are here. Uh they're all doing\nthe thing. I mean for Jerona Tourism, I\nwas laughing because it's every team's\nuh backdrop is [clears throat] this is\nthe cityscape.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. And a lot of teams stay after as\nwell to do their training camp, photo\nshoots, rides, get to know each other.\n&gt;&gt; I do think it's a good idea after\nbecause sometimes before the race\neverybody's a bit nervous and then after\nyou can relax a bit and then talk about\nwhat worked, what didn't work. This is\nuh this is how the the canyon uh team\nwill be operating is actually this is\nwhy I'm here is to uh start my my my new\nrole as the you know field expert\nspieler trainer so to speak for for\nthese guys and their team camp is this\ncoming week so the sponsor meetings and\nthen the racers get to relax you know\nthey've just emptied themselves they\nneed a few days of recovery anyway\nyou're not uh worried about your your\ntraining hours so to speak um so it is a\nreally good moment in February to tick\nall those boxes and set uh all the other\npieces for success. And also, you know,\nthis is even though it's a prestigious\nrace, it is um it's a dress rehearsal\nfor the whole season to come. I mean, a\nlot of these these new teams are ironing\nout the kinks. Today,\n&gt;&gt; we saw now they're in the big climb. We\nsaw Mats uh that had the fall with a bit\nof the mechanical\n&gt;&gt; going there, but trying to get to the\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. And I mean, I can't tell you how\nmany times I've been in this situation.\nWe see big Matt beers on the front just\npile driving the group. Um, this guy, we\njoke he's an 80 kilo climber. I have\nnever seen a guy like this go up a hill.\nUm, it is absolutely phenomenal. Um,\nit's mindboggling to me that he is not\nin the world tour to be honest. I mean,\nMatt Beers is an absolute legend. Um,\nand the fact that it looks [music] like\nRoman has not taken off yet. Um, that's\nsaying something on the kind of pace\nthat Matt Bears is setting on the front\nright now.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you can see how the terrain has\nchanged. It's a bit more rocky, less\nmuddy, and they're starting to pass the\nwoman a bit of the woman pelon that\nstarted an hour before.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. No, it's uh so line choice\nis going to be even more critical. Um I\nmean I think the women it looks like\nwith the conditions it's so broken up. I\nI mean Yeah. Usually, you know, the the\nfront group of the men start to to catch\nuh the the tail end of the women's\npelaton, but I mean, at the pace that\nSophia and Rosa and Morgan are going, I\nmean, they're going to finish\n&gt;&gt; well ahead with a clear clear line.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, last year that was the prediction\nand it happened. I think this year is\nhappening as well. We'll see the women\non the finish line just before the men\narrive.\nIt's nice for the women to have their\nown race, but with these conditions, I\nthink every rider is going to be riding\nby themselves.\n&gt;&gt; Their own race.\n&gt;&gt; Yes. Their their own race. They're going\nto be fighting the demons on their head\nby by by themselves.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yes, they will. Um,\nyou know, and it has been that's been a\nan important evolution is now the the\nseparate starts and even some races the\nseparate days. um just uh you know it\nwas the the mass start format for many\nmany years. Um, and I there was a lot of\nuh age group athletes who loved, you\nknow, that first 30k with the front to\nbe feeling what it was like in in the\npro group, but also as it's gotten\nultimately more competitive um and more\ncutthroat and tighter racing. Um, it was\na natural evolution just for the sake of\nthe sport to start separating the groups\na little bit. Um, and yeah, I mean, I\nthink it's really smart by Classmark to\nhave the women kind of run an hour\nbefore. Um cuz I'd say, you know, the\nwomen finish the winning time is usually\nsomewhere between 30 minutes to an hour\nbehind on a shorter day like today. I\nmean, we're going to have two exciting\nfinales uh kind of just right back to\nback. So, you know, the this shows the\ndiscipline is really starting to get a\nhandle on even like uh how to predict\nthe races.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think it's really important for\nuh each of the categories to have their\nown uh race. it changes a lot when the\nwomen start with the men because\n&gt;&gt; 100%. Um, and I was always a big\nproponent from being an early adopter\nof, you know, just the the communal mass\neffect. But um as it's gotten more\ncompetitive and contracts and livelihood\nare on the line and it's not just a a\ngood time on a bike anymore um you know\nthat it we really started to realize\nlike how much the the women's race is\nbeing influenced by the men's race\nbecause instead of having your own pace\nand your own tactics, it was basically a\ng it was the inverse. It was who could\nuh basically be a really good starter\nand just hang on to a faster group of\nmen per se. Um, and those gaps would\njust widen if you could make it over one\nmore climb or down one descent with a\ngroup and you tack on to a a faster\nmen's echelon. All of a sudden you have\na 1 2 3 minute gap. Um, so now that\nwe're seeing the women actually have\ntheir own start um and battle and attack\nand the dynamics are really coming out,\nit's pretty cool to watch.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, because also like doing those kind\nof starts, you never knew who was in\nfront because everybody was mixed and\nthen\n&gt;&gt; You're like, I don't know where I am.\nlike to see people.\n&gt;&gt; So, here we're uh seeing the Gabaras\nclimb. This is a pretty long climb.\n&gt;&gt; That goes through Gavaras, the national.\n&gt;&gt; Is this the same climb as the final of\nthe Traa?\n&gt;&gt; This goes um they go through there. It\ndoesn't cross. The one in Tracka crosses\nfrom one side to the Gavaras to the\nother side. Here they're going a bit\nmore parallel.\nSo they're riding on Galaras for a\nlonger time.\n&gt;&gt; Okay. Um well that's uh you know that's\nsomething that I think we'll be talking\nabout even more tomorrow is um how much\nof this actually serves as chakra recon\nwhich is one of the you know a career\ndefinfining race later this spring in 10\nweeks time. So um I think the last 30k\nof tomorrow is almost identical to the\nlast 30k of the Choa 300 or 360. Um\n&gt;&gt; and for today as well, I think the last\n15k of today are pretty similar to all\nthe finishes of\n&gt;&gt; right. So every racer in this group then\nI mean they're they're taking this\ncourse at space.\nYou see here Wood Alaman uh mountain\nbike rider really good mountain bike\nrider that mapear stamp Roman and the\nlead group.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. So we have two of the best bike\nhandlers. Uh, and Roman just tacked on\nthe back. The fact that Roman has not\nsurged ahead yet, is uh I'm starting to\nwonder if maybe he's a bit on the limit\nin these conditions today, a little out\nof his comfort zone. Um,\n&gt;&gt; but as you say, maybe it's a good choice\nto see how uh the others are descending\nand just follow their line.\n&gt;&gt; This is true. This is true. He might\njust be able to mimic and hold on and\nand use his watts to close micro gaps\nthe whole way down. Um,\nWe are gonna go connect with Carla.\nShe's in the fit zone and she'll really\nsoon see Rosa Closer, Sophia Gomez, and\nall the women uh pass by her. So, we'll\nconnect to her to see what she has to\nsay.\nHere the first zone. Everybody gets\nMarvin, please anyone here to take the\nbatteries or not?\n&gt;&gt; All the team cars prepping their\nnutrition.\nHello Kak here. I'm in the fit station.\nI'm going to go so you can see a bit.\nWhat's happening? Safia was so fast. She\njust grabbed water bottles. So I\ncouldn't even [laughter]\nalmost see her. So yeah, here you can\nsee starts the system area. All the\nteams ready. Hello.\nThere we go. You can feel the tension.\nEverybody ready? Hello, we are on live.\n&gt;&gt; Everybody\nyou can see. It's crazy all the setups.\nHere we have Anui. She couldn't race.\nHi, Anucci. Why you couldn't race? Well,\nI broke my radio a few months ago, but\nhere I am.\n&gt;&gt; But she's coming back soon.\n&gt;&gt; Yes. [laughter]\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\nAll the bottles. Everybody is ready.\nThe gap looks\nHello.\n&gt;&gt; How did you see Sophia?\n&gt;&gt; She's doing good. Very good.\n&gt;&gt; Woohoo. [laughter]\nWoohoo.\nGo Sophia.\nPerfect.\nOkay. Waiting here for the second. Now\nyou can see it.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. There we go.\n&gt;&gt; Street.\n&gt;&gt; She looks very dense. She cannot find\nelementary team.\n&gt;&gt; Go, go, go. Come on.\n&gt;&gt; No, she has it.\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\nOkay, we just heard from Carla. Uh, aid\nstation, the only aid station that they\ncan give external assistance. You saw\nall the teams are there. It's a nervous\natmosphere. No, because it's really\nimportant to get the nutrition. The\nriders go so fast.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is. And uh it's especially for\nthe teams too, it's so stressful in\nconditions like this because uh you\ndon't know who's coming in where and\nwhere they are on the course and what's\nhappened, you know. So these mechanics\nhave to be ready for anything,\nespecially in this mud. I think\nSpecializ is going to be have every tool\non hand for when Massware Schmidt comes\nthrough in case he's nursing some sort\nof a a bike issue after that spill. Um,\nand then yeah, it's also just again\nthese riders learning the new clothing,\nthe new kits, uh, looking for their team\nsupport. And there we heard Rosa yelling\nfor uh, her ministry nutrition team\nsupport or maybe it was a specific\nbottle. Um,\n&gt;&gt; yeah, it's uh, always nerve-wracking to\nbe there. I've done uh that duty\nrecently and I don't like it. It's super\nstressful. You have to look on your\nrider and they're just shouting. You're\nlike, \"Ah, okay, okay.\" Hey, and then\nyou have to go so fast.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's it's calm under pressure.\nSmall words and effective words.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Kudos to the ones doing it for\nevery race, every event. So, it's a\nproper job.\n&gt;&gt; And I think a lot of them is, you know,\nit's c it's interesting to see who's\njust taking what. I mean, it's all it's\nalmost all on the fly. It's you can't\nstop nowadays um unless there's a real\nissue. Um it's with the cold weather,\nit's just are they taking one bottle or\ntwo? I would expect to just see um some\ngels rubber banded to the bottle even um\nprobably not even needing a full\nmuseette bag and in and all the feed.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but sometimes being cold you waste\nmore energy so you need a bit more food.\n&gt;&gt; This could be very true too. Um and\nagain I think uh uh I heard uh you\ntalking earlier about it is just what\nriders perform well in the cold\nconditions and the hot conditions. Um\nyou know myself I'm always a a heat guy.\nI hate conditions like this. My legs\ndon't want to turn. Um but there's other\nriders who just seem to thrive in it.\n&gt;&gt; I was never good at it either. Like my\nlegs never warm up.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Here in the front we see Walt\nAlamand, Matt Beers, and Roman Bardett\nstill on the lead.\n&gt;&gt; Yep. And are they where Tell me about\nthe course where they are here. Maya,\nthis is on a ridge line. Have they\nstarted the the gnarly descent yet?\n&gt;&gt; No, not yet. They're still on the bit of\nthe climbing. They're done with a really\ntough climbing, but still uh a bit to\ngo.\n&gt;&gt; Okay. And how is the final of the course\nhere? Uh what are we talking in terms of\nhills and features in the last say 30k?\n&gt;&gt; Um not that many. There's a couple of\nsingle tracks before you get the river\ncrossing that we did yesterday that we\nwere saying that's a bit broken. And\nthen you do the part you've done for\nTraa is the big uh gravel road. usually\nin pretty good conditions. Uh really\nnear Constantine.\n&gt;&gt; And then the little climb where you\nescaped from the 360. Remember that you\npulled out from Rob?\n&gt;&gt; Near and dear to my heart.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly. Just uh really just a punchy\none, but it could make a difference.\n&gt;&gt; I mean, I think that's where we need to\nhave all eyes. Uh especially in this\nmen's group. Uh we'll go back to them, I\nguess, because right now we're seeing\nSophia continue to\n&gt;&gt; we're seeing here on the screen the\nwomen's leader. So you have Sophia Gomez\nVyafany and then 2 minutes and 30\nseconds behind Rosa closer 3 minutes and\n11 minute Morgan Agira then Sophie rides\nuh you've seen them there all by\nthemselves\n&gt;&gt; and Lissa Hard talk too for Canyon. Um\n&gt;&gt; here on the screen\n&gt;&gt; looks like Wright and Lissa Hardthog are\ntogether. So that's one of the few\ngroups that we can actually see\ntogether. Uh so they might be able to\npull themselves into podium contention\nhere by the end of the day. Um, Lissa is\na uh a young uh Dutch phenom that Canyon\njust scooped up. She's a psychos\nspecialist. So, I think she's right at\nhome in these conditions actually today.\nLoving it.\nBut yeah, that going back to that\nfeature uh the the final, sorry, that\nlittle bump. Um that is a steep\ncorrugated wall and it's not long, but\num I mean that's where I was able to\ncreate the trocoa winning move. And so\num I think that's where uh Roman's\nprobably going to have to put all his\ncards, especially with the lack of\nclimbing to come. It's uh the fact that\nhe hasn't distanced them here. He\nprobably isn't confident to be able to\nhold it on the flat. Um, Matt Beers is\nsuch a powerful rider. I mean, the fact\nthat he climbs with those watts, but\nthen he has those watts once the road\nflattens out is he's he's like a steam\nengine or a locomotive. Sorry. Um, but\nuh so I think even if even if Roman is\ncomfortable, maybe he just knows that it\nwould just be he'd just be sitting out\nthere by himself and they would come\nright back to him. So he's probably\nsaving everything for for one shot late.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. And especially you have that\nlittle climb where you escaped and uh\nit's uh pretty flat to the end. It's not\nlong because they finished in Sanori and\n[music] not in Jirona this time. So it's\num 3 4 km from that that little climb.\n&gt;&gt; So yeah, it looks like that those three\nleaders uh [music] Kaiser is kind of\ncoming back to them. He kind of got\ngapped, but he's holding steady now. Um,\nDan Sot Nasur Schmidt and then the the\nChasing Pelaton is three minutes back.\nNever expected like breaking up that\nquickly. I thought I was going to keep\ntogether a bit more, but with this\ncondition,\nI think it's what uh today brings.\n&gt;&gt; I think Yeah, I think the mud is the\ndefining factor even more than the\n[music] climbing and the terrain.\nYeah, we saw it a few minutes ago how\nthey were struggling in the mud and\ncrossing the river. And I want to see\nthe I want to hear the stories once they\ncross the finish line. There's going to\nbe a lots of stories.\n&gt;&gt; And a big thing tomorrow actually too is\num I know when I head back to the the\nCanyon House tonight is uh we're going\nto make sure that every rider is really\ntaking care of themselves because um\nyou know it's it's a stage race. you\nhave to perform tomorrow and when you're\nswallowing this kind of mud uh sometimes\nsome bacterias and manure whatever from\nthe the agriculture and the you know\nit'll get in there. So uh we are hoping\n[music] and fingers crossed that every\nrider uh stays healthy tonight.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we saw a lot of that happening\nespecially in um when you do races in uh\nSouth America\n&gt;&gt; like Colombia or Mexico or like people a\nlot of people coming from Europe usually\ngot sick. Yeah,\n&gt;&gt; I think there here it's not that bad,\nbut yeah, there's a lot of uh cow fields\n&gt;&gt; Exactly. Just the nature of gravel even\nmore than the road is, you know, they\nare\n&gt;&gt; not me.\n&gt;&gt; And your bottle always gets filthy. Like\nyou start drinking, you're like, \"Oo, I\ndon't\n&gt;&gt; I mean, these are all the little things\nthat you have to start thinking about\nonce you start really focusing on gravel\nis even like certain bottles are better\nthan others because if they have that\nopen reservoir top, we just call that\nthe E.coli catcher.\n&gt;&gt; [laughter]\n&gt;&gt; So\n&gt;&gt; sometimes what I did is like just take a\nsip and then like throw it in there so\nyou clean a bit of\n&gt;&gt; I would always Yeah, I do the same. You\nkind of squirt onto the road for a sec\njust to clear what like the initial\nsurge. Uh it's always really smart.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. But even like uh yesterday that we\ndid the track force woman's ride uh just\nriding on the wheel of somebody, you're\ngetting all the mud on your face, on\nyour mouth. So I think nobody's going\nclear today.\nNo.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. And talking about that, uh, the\nTracka Force is a program that we\ncreated to get more women on the start\nline because for track now we have um\nalmost 20% of the participants being\nwomen, but we want to be more.\n&gt;&gt; So yeah, we created this group. I'll\ntell you more about it. But now we're\nseeing uh highlights of the women start\nand then we'll see highlights of the\nBrown\nfeel.\nAll right,\nPete back here. Uh, we just took a a\nwell-deserved break. Uh, [music] my\nhusband on all morning. Um,\nwe're seeing the men's highlights now.\num, this is all still highlights and\njust showing what [music] we've had\nhappen so far, uh, to catch us up and\nbring us right back into the fold. if\nyou're just joining us for the final.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, we saw a bit of a try to escape\nhere on the road as we were saying a few\nkilometers on the road before they hit\nthis steep climb on the gravel.\n&gt;&gt; So, this is the entry. This is what\neveryone was talking about and there was\nthis is where the team dynamic was\nreally taking shape is riders were\nfocused on getting [music] their best\nclimbers or their favorites into\nposition for what you saw that\nbottleneck cuz if you were in the back\nthere you were running.\n&gt;&gt; Yes. Because it's a steep climb with a\nlot of loose gravel on it. So\n&gt;&gt; and yeah the quickly that uh lead group\nof uh six to seven [music] formed um and\nthey started to pry open their gap.\nYou can get an idea of the conditions\nhere. This is the river crossing where\nwe were talking if somebody Oh, there's\nsomebody riding\n&gt;&gt; and then\nsome carrying [music] their bikes.\nBrutal conditions today.\nMattwards\n&gt;&gt; [music]\n&gt;&gt; uh climbing had a fall\nat the beginning of the day on the mod.\n&gt;&gt; Yep. And then finally, we hit the\nbiggest climb of the day. Uh where the\nlead three, [music] Matt Beers, Roman\nBardday, and Alaman Pride away. And it\nlooks like they're going to be fighting\nfor the podium. We're here with Carla.\n&gt;&gt; Hello. Here we are. Riders are taking\nthe photo super super fast.\nThey didn't have any issue. Hola. Hello.\n&gt;&gt; Hola. [laughter]\n&gt;&gt; How are you? How are you? Good. And you?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Who are you waiting?\n&gt;&gt; Uh Sophia, we uh we're not waiting for\nanybody anymore. They've all passed\nthrough thankfully, but we're with\nSophia in the lead. So, uh, things are\nlooking good today.\n&gt;&gt; How did you see them?\n&gt;&gt; Uh, they look good. Sophia was in the\nfront, so she looked very comfortable,\nstill in control, and had a 2 and 1/2\nminute gap. So, we're hoping she can\nmaintain that to the finish.\n&gt;&gt; Thank you so much.\n&gt;&gt; A specialized mechanic.\n&gt;&gt; Here you can see how they are ready to\nprepare\n&gt;&gt; for the bottles.\nRiders are taking the bottles super\nsuper fast. I didn't see any incidents.\nHello. [laughter]\n&gt;&gt; Hello.\n&gt;&gt; Let's see. We could find this guy has\nlots of bottles. Who are you waiting\nfor?\n&gt;&gt; Uh, pass racing.\n&gt;&gt; Pass racing. [laughter] How do you see\nthem?\n&gt;&gt; Oh, I see them.\n&gt;&gt; you're looking pretty good.\nThank you so much.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, good to see Carla on the field.\nShe's in the aid station where the teams\ncan give bottles and assistance to the\nriders. Really important point.\n&gt;&gt; So, here we are. We have uh it looks\nlike a bit of consolidation there.\nThere's a chasing group uh that's got uh\nMaser Schmidt and Dan [music] Sot in\nthere. Uh just trailing off of that lead\ntrio.\nAgain, the question is if they can\nactually make it back. Um I think it's\ngoing to all come down to the\ncollaboration in the front and seeing\n[music] if they uh cuz for sure the the\nback group, I mean, they're all in. None\nof them are riding for the podium right\nnow. [music] So, they're all going to be\nfully together and it looks like they've\njust become a group of four. So, if\nthere's any games in the front, um we\nmight see a big group start to rejoin.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. And they're [music] not that far\nbehind.\nGood riders working together.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it looks like it is actually all\ncoming back together.\n&gt;&gt; You can see here in the map they're\nstill riding. The men are still riding\nin the Gavaras.\nuh bit more rocky\nbit click climb big descents and uh yeah\nI think this is the most technical part\nof the course\n&gt;&gt; it looks like it's starting to dry out.\nIt's like now the sun is starting to\nbake that mud down. The puddles are\nstarting to just absorb back into the\nground. Um so it's going to maybe get a\nlittle tackier which sometimes makes it\na little slower in my opinion. Um\nbecause it's like sometimes when it is\nactually so wet, you just kind of slice\nthrough it and then as the the [music]\nground really actually starts to harden\nis actually when the mud is act at its\nabsolute worst before it actually fully\n[music] becomes dry again. And that's\nwhen it can actually get tacky. Um so if\nany riders have been gambling with uh\ntire clearance in the name of volume, um\nwe might start to see some coagulation\nissues. But it also depends, I guess, on\nyour local knowledge of like kind of\nwhat the the dirt consistency is. If\nit's more of a clay base and more of a\n[music] sandy beach base,\n&gt;&gt; it changes like it's that part of the\ncourse they're at now, it's uh it\ndoesn't make a difference, [music] but\nin the next part of the course they're\ngoing, it does. So,\nI actually have some information here as\nI saw from the the Canyon internal chat\n[music] as uh they went through the feed\nzone that it sounds like Rosa crashed\nhard and that's how the gap happened. Uh\nshe was we heard her in a bit of a panic\nthere. She [music] crashed hard so she's\nback up and chasing. Um but it looks\nlike that gap is holding kind of steady\nat the moment. Um and that's how that\ngap opened up.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, good to know. Here [music] you\nhave your uh 20 women, top 20 women from\nstage one [music] at the moment.\n&gt;&gt; Big gaps forming now.\n&gt;&gt; Very big gaps. Yeah, we have Carolyn\nSchiff and [music] Clara Copenberg\nlining up at the bottom there. Um just\ninside the top 20.\nWendy Osterwood. We have Aneka Langard\nhere 14 minutes behind.\nYep.\nClaraara Coppenberg [music] will be an\ninteresting addition to the season\nbecause she's a a very well-known world\ntour climber. Uh she was riding with\nCopus for [music] many years and and uh\nas she starts to dabble with with\ngravel, it'll see if uh she starts to\nget the technical aspects down and\nreally start to excel.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's good to see woman uh road\nracing riders coming to the gravel.\nMorgan Aguir here. uh third at the\n&gt;&gt; Morgan's a she's a really interesting\nrider for me because she is what I was\ntalking about earlier that she's not a\ncrossover athlete. She came straight\ninto gravel. She was uh just like\nlearning how to ride a few seasons ago.\nSo, her trajectory has been pretty\nastounding. Um and uh she's really just\ncontinued to study and level up and\nwatch what the best riders are doing and\nmimic it. And I think she's really\nstarting to see the benefits of that.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, she's so professional. She knows\nwhat she has to do. She trains really\ntwo like if the coach says 2 hours and 1\nminute, she does 2 hours and 1 minute.\nShe's uh really competitive. She's come\na long way. She's learned a lot and it's\ngood to see her uh riding today uh third\nposition. And this is the part of the\nterrain that you were saying that uh it\ngets clay. It's the point that you start\nlike looking to your back. It's like, is\nmy bike okay? It's suddenly happening\nbecause it just starts feeling like\nreally hard to pedal.\n&gt;&gt; Interesting. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it'll\nbe sticky. Uh, and it also looks open.\nSo, this is where the wind might start\nto take effect, too. Um, sometimes the\nwind actually dries out the mud\ninterestingly fast, which is always uh\nbeen interesting to me as I continue to\nride more and more gravel. Um, but it it\nlooks kind of tacky and sticky right now\nto be honest. Um, which means it's just\nkind of like you're just all it almost\nfeels like you're just climbing all day.\nI mean, you don't actually get to on a\nflat in conditions like this. It's just\nlike it's like here kind of like riding\non a sponge all day long. Absolutely.\nJust it sucks. [laughter]\n&gt;&gt; And also, it depends the pressure you\nput in the tires today. I think it was\nreally important to dial the pressure of\nthe tires.\nAnd it's a balance too, right? Between,\nyou know, you want the volume for the\ncomfort um and when it is actually uh\nkind of sticky like this, like the\nvolume kind of actually helps spread the\nweight, but then the rest of the day\nyou've been worrying about maybe mud\npacking up and that's where you actually\nwant a narrower tire for the clearance.\nSo, um it's just there's never a good\noption in conditions like this. It's\nreally just evaluating everything and I\ncan guarantee you all these riders were\nhming and hawing last night having their\nmechanics change their equipment at\n11:00 p.m. as the rain was still coming.\nUm, this is uh yeah, the stress levels\nwere very high last night with this\ncondition.\n&gt;&gt; So yeah, I wouldn't be the like to be in\nthe point of a mechanic last night or\ntoday because uh a lot of the riders are\ngoing to be thinking of changing a lot\nof their gearing for tomorrow. They're\ngoing to have a hard job cleaning and\ngetting all the bikes ready ready for\ntomorrow as well.\n&gt;&gt; Well, tell me, how is the how does it\nmostly differ [music] between today and\ntomorrow in terms of the course, the\ndynamic, the layout.\n&gt;&gt; I think it's super different [music]\nbecause today there's a big climb, you\nhave the road, and then tomorrow from\nthe start it goes up.\n&gt;&gt; Really steep up and then when you get to\nthe top you do a single track. [music]\nSo position is key.\n&gt;&gt; Oh wow. And then it's a shorter stage.\nEverybody wants to go full gas.\n&gt;&gt; So it's a war from the start.\n&gt;&gt; Oh wow. Okay.\n&gt;&gt; People are going to have to like warm up\ntheir bodies uh pretty quickly. We'll\nstart 1 hour after. So it makes a bit of\na difference. It's going to be a bit uh\nwarmer. Uh but yeah, tomorrow uh it's\ngoing to be a epic battle. Okay,\n&gt;&gt; here we see um 226, one of the nutrition\nsponsors from here. Tire sponsors as\nwell. Pretty important. They have\ndifferent type of tires. I would have uh\nI think grippy for today. What do you\nthink?\n&gt;&gt; Um I was checking around on the start\nline actually and having a [music] look\nat that. Um and I saw a lot of grip up\nfront. I mean, I think it's twisty\nenough and especially with the the\nlittle bit of rain. Um, you just uh can\nbe slippery. I think a grippy front tire\nand a lot of big volume. [music] I saw\nlike a lot of 50s in the front today.\nUm, and kind of a mullet protocol. So, a\nlot of riders were opting for a fast\nrolling [music] tire in the back with a\nlittle bit of side knob. So,\n&gt;&gt; for the mud, that's where\n&gt;&gt; I think it was mud, but also just the\npavement and the pedaling efficiency.\nUm, you know, it's always a question now\nof grip versus rolling resistance, um,\nthe tire volume. And one thing that I\noften opt for in a lot of my racing, uh,\nthat's become quite popular in Propelon\nis what we call the mullet setup. So, a\nbig aggressive front tire for control\nand a fast [music] rolling tire in the\nback, knowing that bike handling skills\nand being able to drift the rear wheel\nis less, you know, the the handling of\nthe rear wheel doesn't matter as much.\n&gt;&gt; mountain bikers do that a lot.\nYou can always see that in mountain\nbikers. It's always different. The front\ntire and the back tire.\n&gt;&gt; It's interesting to see that the gravel\n&gt;&gt; scene is doing that, too.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. I think a lot of the mountain bike\ntech is um really translating over. Um\nand we've seen a lot of mountain bikers\nreally start to thrive in the gravel\nspace. I would say\nmore than 50%. [music] Um, and I think\nmost of it is just uh I think we've\nalways known the mountain bikers have\nsuch big engines, but you know, Road has\nbeen so famous. It's got such a big\nplatform, you know, with the World Tour\num and the TV rights and um mountain\nbikers have always not had the same\nattention compared to World Tour Road,\nbut the athletes are astounding, right?\nThey're they're absolute specimens and\nthere's no reason that they couldn't be\nendurance [music] athletes. They just\nlove off-road and mountain biking. So,\nnow that gravel is really growing, I\nthink we are seeing um the true\nendurance capabilities of the off-road\nracers really start to rise. Um, and I\nthink it's actually an easier step if\nyou come from mountain biking to come\ninto gravel because you can always train\nfor the endurance, right? That's a\ntraining thing and they've spent their\nwhole formative years uh working on the\nbike handling. Whereas, if you've really\nworked on your engine in [music] the\nworld tour, then you know, you come into\nthe off-road space, it's a lot harder to\nuh to uh catch up, so to speak.\nSo, we are here with the second woman,\nRosa Closer.\nLast time we saw the gaps, it was 2\nminutes and 30 seconds to Sophia.\nI've passed the almost half of the\nof the stage from today. You can see it\non the screen.\nNow it's a bit more of the flatty part.\nThat's when you want somebody with you.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly. Um and like I said, we had just\nfound out that Rosa actually had a\npretty hard crash and that's how that\nthat gap happened. So, I mean, she looks\nlike she's trucking along and and she's\nactually got a good pace and she looks\nsteady. She's bent down in a more arrow\nposition um as much as she can be\nobviously with the conditions and I\nthink uh\nyeah, so it looks like it's not\naffecting her too bad yet, but that was\nthe the gap.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we didn't see her stop in the tech\nzone, so bike is okay. She's okay.\nhopefully mentally uh she's pretty\nstrong and uh can\n&gt;&gt; um from what I know of Rosa uh from team\ndinners and all of that at Canyon, she's\nuh she is a competitor. Um and I I\nguarantee you she's going to go find a\nphysio tonight, get her her body\nrealigned if anything's off, and she's\ngoing to come out with a vengeance\ntomorrow, I think. So, I think we're\nactually hopefully setting up for a real\ngood battle for the overall tomorrow. I\nthink Ros is going to have to go on the\nattack. Uh we'll see what the final gap\nis at the end of the day today. Um but\nuh I mean Rose is going to have to be\naggressive tomorrow.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. And it's a long season. It's just\nFebruary and so many races. Some um\npeople take this as a prep, some people\ntake it as a they want to win,\n&gt;&gt; of course.\n&gt;&gt; So everybody's uh different stages of\ntheir training. Keegan and Matt are\ntraining for the Cape Epic. They're\ngoing to ride together. So they have to\nbe a bit more on points. And then some\nriders is just they're coming off of\nwinter. Maybe just doing the rollers for\na bit. A lot of snow. It's been a really\nhard winter in Europe. So everybody is\nin different peak of uh form and it's\nnice to see how today is playing out\n&gt;&gt; 100%. Um and also how it portrays to the\nGraler series and the points like um\nbecause this is now Santal by the TRAA.\nWhere does it sit in the um the points\nclassification, the the tiers of the\nraces, so to speak?\n&gt;&gt; I think the points for uh anything by\nthe trucker are the same. They're not\ngoing to be many um changes. And then\nthe point system, it's a bit more clear\nthis year. It's easier to follow.\n&gt;&gt; So, not that many races. I know they\n[music] have to do four the for the\nelites, they have to point on four of\nthe races and then do the final. that's\n[music] in Belgium uh beginning of se of\nSeptember and for the um age group\ncategory that is new for this year they\nhave to do two races and the final as\n[music] well. So it's nice to see\nthere's a lot of uh competition\nhappening today not just the elite men\nor elite women also the age groupers. So\ntoday is going to be a fight to the line\nfor everybody. So we're seeing here I\nwas just wondering if that time gap was\nactually correct in the mess where\nSchmidt was only 5 seconds back and it\nlooks like he's rejoining actually. Wow.\n&gt;&gt; So I mean he was a minute 20 down. I\nmean that is a time trial to say the\nleast. Um\n&gt;&gt; how how tired is he now? How beat up is\nhe? Or has the front just kind of been\nplaying [music] games? Um\n&gt;&gt; I don't think so. Uh we've been seeing\nthem like just working together and it's\nnot an easy course to just play. You\nhave to push it because it's the climb\nand then it's the descent. But you've\ndone the comeback as well. You did track\n360 was the same uh for you. No, you\nwere super far like behind far [music]\nbehind and then you came together.\n&gt;&gt; It was a beautiful moment for me but it\nwas a a very important lesson that it's\nin gravel especially [music] it's never\nover till the finish line. anything can\nhappen even in the closing single track.\nSo, you have to keep pushing the whole\nway. Um, but I mean, Maya, this race\njust really opened because we thought\nand I thought that we were just looking\nat the podium fight and now it's a group\nof four and there's two specialized\nriders in that group of four.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. And now once they finish the\ndescent that uh they're almost done with\nit, uh, the flats part starts. So, this\nis where Matt can drive. No, we saw him\nin Rancho. He had a big fall, but he was\ndoing great and I think uh he's getting\ninto his strength.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean, yeah, like you said, Matt\nis going to be very comfortable coming\nup. Um and you know, Messor Schmidt with\nthe the flat terrain and the wind being\nfrom Denmark, being a World Tour the\nnext World Tour rider. Um I mean, this\nis also his forte. Um\nnow we're going to start seeing if where\nthe [music] team tactics come into play.\nI mean, this is what we've been talking\nabout for months. We are going to see uh\nSpecialized, they've recruited, you\nknow, they have two five-star [music]\nfavorites of their their three um their\nfearsome threesome, if you will. And uh\nI mean, my gosh, [music]\nyou know, are they going to work\ntogether? Are they going to start one\ntwoing Roman and WOW? Are WO and Roman\ngoing to have to create an allegiance?\nUm and is there some ego within\nSpecialized? I mean, these are two race\nwinners in their own right, and I, you\nknow, they both want to put their best\nfoot forward.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. But from what I've heard, uh,\nthey're working as [music] a team, so\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay.\nI mean, yeah. So, they're going to have\nto play the game. I mean, I would assume\n[music] that Master Schmidt wants to\ntake a breather here and uh take a\nbreak, use the excuse uh that he just\nchased back, which [music] is a very\nwelldeserved excuse at the moment. Um\n&gt;&gt; yeah, we we will see also how much\nenergy he has to\n&gt;&gt; had to put into this chase to get to the\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Um and [music] as far as sprint,\nyou know, if it does come down to a\nsprint, um I don't know how Specialized\nwe play it to be honest. Um, I know Matt\n[music] uh normally had not worked on\nhis sprint or was not a great sprinter,\nbut Matt Beers has really worked on his\nsprint the last two years and we saw him\nout sprint uh Keegan and a few other\nraces for some big wins last season. Um,\nand so that this will be interesting.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we've seen Walt Alamman sprint\nbeing a good sprinter as well.\n&gt;&gt; Um, for sure. Uh, Roman Barde is the the\nworst sprinter in that group, I would\nsay. So, he needs to do something. I\nmean now that he's not the podium is not\nguaranteed. Um you know he's his his\nstrength is having that road uh tactical\nbase.\n&gt;&gt; So you know he's he's calculating\neverything in his mind right now like a\nchess game.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Now is where the uh chess game\nbegins. So you start to look around how\neverybody is.\n&gt;&gt; Yep. But we have another chasing group\nonly 30 seconds back. So, if they play\ntoo many games, I mean, we're going to\nstart talking bunch sprint finish here.\n&gt;&gt; nobody wants that.\n&gt;&gt; No one wants that. The thing with the\nthis course is it's so suous and twisty.\nYou can't if you look back, you can't\ntell if there's a group right there or\nif they're 5 minutes behind or 5 seconds\nbehind. Um, so, you know, these guys are\nreally flying blind. Um,\n&gt;&gt; yeah, if you just joined, uh, women\nhave, uh, been on the stage for 3 hours\nand 6 minutes and the men for 2 hours\nand 6 minutes. The women still have, uh,\n34 km to go and the men 54 [music] km to\ngo. This last 30 km are pretty fast. So,\nwe'll have the woman, I think, maybe in\nless than an hour [music] and 15 minutes\nback here. Uh, it's been a great racing.\nWe have Sophia [music] Gomez Vinya F on\nthe lead on the woman and we just saw\nthe men group of four on the lead with\nRoma W element\nuh Matt Beers and Matt WS. So pretty\nstrong riders. It's been a [music] hard\nday. We are kind seeing the sun coming\nout. Not that much wind at the moment\nhere on San Gregori, but\nwe'll go to Carla to see what's [music]\nhappening in the course at the moment.\n&gt;&gt; Here we are waiting for the men. As you\ncan see, everybody is super quiet. You\ncan feel the tension from here. No\nmovement.\nSo, let's see. I'm going to walk a bit\nso you can also feel it.\n&gt;&gt; Hello, guys. How are you?\n&gt;&gt; Hello, lady. I'm good.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Who are you waiting for?\n&gt;&gt; Uh, food.\n&gt;&gt; Food. Oh, [laughter] nice.\nA bit of humor. [snorts]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n&gt;&gt; There we go. You can see everybody\nwaiting.\ngoing to stop here. I don't want to miss\nthe [laughter]\nthe leaders\ncherry\ngo\nhands baking. Who are you waiting for?\nI'm getting super nervous\nnow. I have to drive.\n&gt;&gt; Motor bike is here. So, heads up because\nthey should be here soon.\nThat's it.\nOkay, in 30 seconds they should be here.\n&gt;&gt; 30 seconds.\n&gt;&gt; I'm getting more nervous.\n&gt;&gt; So, let's see.\nUh,\n&gt;&gt; now they are coming. Heads up.\nBoth here.\nOkay. Now,\n&gt;&gt; okay, let's count the gap now.\n&gt;&gt; motor bikers.\nThe following group is coming.\n&gt;&gt; Come on.\nOkay, I'm going to be a move so you can\nsee everybody, all the teams, all the\nsetups.\nOkay, we saw Carla in the aid station\nwhere the riders can get assistance. We\nsaw the first two group on the men. We\nsaw the team managers pretty nervous.\nIt's as we said, it's pretty\nnerve-wracking moment. They need to dial\ntheir nutrition. They go by the fit\nstation super fast. So, you have to\ntalked with your rider before, you know,\nyou have to know in which side they feel\ncomfortable grabbing the bottle because\nfor what we saw, they're going 35 km an\nhour. They have to know where you are.\nYou have to put the team jersey so they\ncan see you. They can spot you. You saw\nthe team managers just shouting. We saw\nPa Samura from the B uh booth BH team uh\ngetting there shouting wow wow you have\nto be clear and then uh giving the\nbottle giving the the nutrition they\nneed.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. No, it's a it's a very tense time\nespecially it's it's the wait wait wait\nwait and then rush for these team\nmechanics and these managers. Uh you're\nhoping that you're just giving a bottle\naway. Uh, but they also have to be ready\nfor everything. They have to have a a\nwhole slew of tools. Maybe the rider\nneeds a plug or a CO2 if they burn one,\nbut they can still keep racing. And then\nyou need all the big fixes to fix it in\ncase there's been a catastrophic break.\nUm, but so far we haven't really seen\nmany mechanicals today.\n&gt;&gt; No, not from what we've seen. Maybe we\nhear after a lot of mechanicals. I think\nthere's going to be a lot of mechanicals\nwith the kind of terrain we are seeing\nwith the mud, with the water, uh chains,\nbrakes, uh maybe not that many flats,\nbut\n&gt;&gt; the war stories coming out of this,\n&gt;&gt; but for the fronts, thank god we haven't\nseen anything uh going through.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. And once it is these smaller\ngroups, it's a lot more easy to manage\nyour line. You know, it's those early\ndays, that's where most of the\nmechanicals happen is when you're just\nin that big group and you're just\nslamming things with your wheels and you\ncan't see. Um,\n&gt;&gt; yeah, we're seeing finally the sun\ncoming out.\nThe riders must be happy there. We see\nthem trying to stretch the legs from\nBardet.\n&gt;&gt; Going to get a bit of a breather. It's\nbeen a pretty hard um beginning of the\nstage. Everything happens on the\nbeginning. Now we have a bit more of you\ncan call it chill time. There's never\nchill time on the gravel, but yeah, they\ncan look around a bit, see how they're\ndoing, see how their material is doing,\nand uh yeah, start to plan for the\nwhat's ahead.\n&gt;&gt; Yep. And we have uh on that right\nscreen, it's Dan Soete and and Kaiser\nare they're within a minute, you know,\nand on these long stretches now that\nwe're in the more open farmlands, um\nthat's where you can actually get\nglimpses of the front group. So maybe\nthey'll get a little bit of inspiration\nthere to to get back. Um,\n&gt;&gt; there are two good riders on the flat.\nThey're pretty strong as well. So, they\ncan work together and uh if these ones\nstart to look to each other,\n&gt;&gt; they can come back.\n&gt;&gt; It looks like everyone's pulling through\nnow. You know, it looks like Messor\nSchmidt has has caught his breath and\nhe's starting to contribute and uh\nsolidify this this gap. Um, and you\nknow, Matt Beers is always happy to to\ntake a turn. I mean, he rides uh with\nhis heart on his sleeve and uh and is um\nhe he rides with with honor and pache,\nso he he's never one to skip out on a\npole.\n&gt;&gt; I really like their team kits. You can\nreally tell them apart. Specializ has\ndone a really good job with that. Pretty\ncool colors. We see Matt's wearing the\nsame but with a European jersey.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. And then the that Rafa kit\nwith Roman is also uh very easy. The\nblack and white with a little bit of\npink is um you know they're everywhere.\nAnd they have they have an interesting\nthing too. You can't quite call them a\nteam but the uh the Rafa\nteam collective. I can't I don't know\nwhat word they're using. Uh but it's uh\nthey have a lot of good riders. Um not\nhere today, but you know that in uh\nAustralia we saw uh them stack the front\nof that race. There was uh Cameron Jones\nwho's the unbound winner. uh Ian Boswell\nuh and a bunch of guys were all in the\nsame kit. Um and they actually rode\ntogether. It's um these these collective\nteams. I think even even p Racing races\na little bit like this is um it's not\nlike a full team\ncollusion so to speak. Uh but it's more\nof like a you know you had a friend in\nthere. there's an allegiance um that you\ncan rely on and you won't screw each\nother over per se, but you're also doing\nyour own race. And so that's how those\nuh Rafa guys are working.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I really like this system. It's\nthe like kind of the path racing and uh\nfactor racing. It's like they give you\nyour the bikes. It works kind of like a\nteam, but you have freedom of choosing\nyour clothing, your gearings. Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Some more partners, sponsors. So, it's\nlike a bit of freedom, but in a\ncollective, as you say. So, I like this\nthis No, it's been an interesting and\nit's, you know, as we see these teams\nand privateeers and that that discussion\nand that evolution change is um you're\nseeing riders really have to choose\nbecause on a team, you know, you're\nguaranteed much better support. I mean,\nyou you can really just focus on being a\nracer and some riders just want to be a\nracer. uh a private tier I think if you\nyou're more incentivized um and you have\nto running a single program of one to be\na team of one so you're doing all the\nother things um and you have to be on\nyour feet more you have to do photo\nshoots more um all the negotiations all\nthe hustle there's no team staff picking\nup at the airport you're renting the car\nchecking into the Airbnb doing the\ngrocery shopping um so what it can be\npotentially more financially lucrative\nto be a privateeer if you're willing to\nhustle, but if you want to focus solely\non the racing results, uh I think teams\nare starting to really prioritize that.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. It's a good mix to see and uh good\ninsights because you've been a\nprivateier like all your gravel career.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I was lucky to uh\nbenefit from being in the world tour for\nfor a long healthy decade. And uh it was\nbecause I had my eyes open and tried to\nabsorb everything that I could really\nsee uh how teams operated and I brought\na lot of that attitude to my personal\nprivateeering program. Um and I think\nthat's the essence of gravel. No,\nbecause um you can be different and\ngravel is because you're different. So\nif you like being part of the team and\ngetting all the structure, okay, you\n[music] can do that. But you can do the\nprivateier and have a bit more\nflexibility and um or like uh as you say\nlike a mix of team with uh flexibility.\n[music]\nSo\n&gt;&gt; here on your screen you have the leaders\non the men's side.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. So we saw that group of four go\nthrough that feed zone uh little while\nago. Um we have Kaiser and Roth coming\nthrough [music] and then uh we have\nVakotch coming back. you know, Pet Per,\nhe he will never say die. Um, and he\nalways is a a strong strong in the\nsecond half of the game, so to speak.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. And he's riding with Hans Becking,\nanother mountain biker. Both are now\nlocals in Jurona, [music] so they know\nthe course pretty well. They're racers\nand they'll\n&gt;&gt; and it looks like Okay. Well, we have\nLuca Drestler and Braden Lang. They are\nteammates on [music] the new Canyon DT\nSwiss gravel team uh in that chase group\nat 3 minutes. And this is a big group.\nUh Mike Woods is sitting in there. Uh\nFrederick Rossman, another DT Swiss\nrider. Paul Voss. Um\n&gt;&gt; here's Anol Morel. He's the [music]\nrider we've been talking about. Traa\nroots. So the youngster that uh Class is\nhelping out so he can make it to the pro\nranks.\n&gt;&gt; Sitting right there in the top 30. And I\nguess what we would be considering is\nthe Pelaton. Now I mean this is a big\nenough group that [music] I would\nconsider this is like the Pelaton. And\nit looks like Magnus Bachclars, the\ndefending champ, is kind of, you know,\nhe's not having the best day today.\n&gt;&gt; No, it's been it's been a hard day and\nuh it's the first of the season for\nalmost everybody. It's good. It's good\none to see who is where in their\npreparation, in their moment, in their\npickup form.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. So Magnus was pretty good last\nyear, but maybe he's prepping for he\nsaid truck out was one of his\nobjectives. So maybe Santaval is not\nthat objective this year.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think a lot of riders if you\nlook at the season, they aim for a uh an\nApril and May peak because within uh one\nmonth basically or a 5we rolling period,\nyou have the troa and unbound. So that's\nkind of like the pinnacle um of the the\ngravel season is that uh April May\nblock. Um, and also, you know, it's so\nhard because of conditions like this. In\na road race, you see a rider four\nminutes off the back. It's like\n&gt;&gt; very Yeah. And and very rarely it's just\nthey got dropped. You Sorry. Normally\nit's they got dropped. Very rarely is it\nsomething else, but you know, the fact\nthat Magnus was four plus minutes down\nlike it kind of means nothing today.\nlike it's it could have been a crash or\nsomething with the mud or you know um a\ndropped bottle and so he might come back\nwith a vengeance tomorrow. Um I think a\nbig thing that I'm going to have to do\ntonight is go I'm excited to go stalk\nthe uh the social media and kind of play\ndetective and sleuth and see what\nhappened cuz I think that's going to\nplay a lot into tomorrow's story.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I love stage racing because uh so\nmany things can happen. And maybe you\nhave 5 minutes advantage on the first\nday and something happens on the second\nday or you're not feeling uh recovered.\n&gt;&gt; There's good riders that can recover\nquickly and there's the rider that\nprefer one day stages because now it's\ngetting here. You have to get the proper\nnutrition, go back home, clean all the\nmaterial, sleep well and then do the\nright warm up for tomorrow and maybe\nyour legs tomorrow are dead and you\ndon't feel it. Yeah, I mean, yeah, as\nyou know, the the recovery is the name\nof the game in stage racing and uh we\nlike to joke with a serious tone that uh\nimmediately after the finish today is\nthe next race for the race. Uh it's\nracing back to the hotel, uh recovery\nprotocols, massages, uh just dialing in\neverything just right to optimize that\nrecovery. Um, and it's uh anytime you're\njust hanging around, it's uh it's no\nbeers and coffee after the finish line\ntoday. That'll be tomorrow.\n&gt;&gt; No. Yeah, we'll see happy faces\ntomorrow. Today is still a bit of\nserious faces.\n&gt;&gt; So, here we have, you know, the lead for\nit. Looks like they're fully\ncollaborating. Um, you know, it's always\ninteresting doing the the echelon and\nthe pace line on the gravel tracks\nbecause you have that high crown in the\nmiddle with the dirt and sometimes\nthere's rocks and debris in there. So,\nyou really have to take a longer pull\nthan you would maybe want sometimes uh\ntill it's a good moment to kind of chop\nover and hop that that like that center\ndivider, so to speak. Um just always\nkeeps it a little more interesting. You\ngot to stay on your toes.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. You can never wonder. No, because\nsometimes on the road you can just\nswitch off your head, switch off and\nrelax a bit, but on the gravel is the\nmoment you switch off when something\nhappens. So,\n&gt;&gt; 100%.\n&gt;&gt; You have to be on point all the time.\nAnd uh it adds up to being tired. It\njust I always feel these kind of races\nmentally are\nso difficult.\n&gt;&gt; Definitely.\n&gt;&gt; Now we're seeing shots from the drone.\nSun finally coming out.\nYeah, we can see it's uh we're getting\nshadows out here at the finish line\nright now. It's uh looking like a\nbeautiful day. Um you know, I am with\nthese conditions. I'm not envious of\nthese guys racing today. I am I'm\ntotally fine being in here in the comm's\nbooth with you and I actually uh brought\nmy bike and I get a ride home today in\nin my shorts and my maybe some arm\nwarmers at the most. So I think I I I\nchose the winning call today for best\nday on the bike.\n&gt;&gt; You can go wrecky the ride for tomorrow.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, there we go. Okay,\n&gt;&gt; maybe the climb if you want to\n&gt;&gt; report back. [laughter]\n&gt;&gt; Or maybe just go grab a beer. It's not a\nbad uh option either.\nSo here we are seeing the front group of\nthe men. We have the two specialized\nwriters Matt Beers and Matt Warts. We\nhave Watt Alamman from the Bof BH team\nand Roman Bardett from Rafa riding a\nfactor bike.\nfactors um good collective as well.\nYeah, I think you know as we were\ntalking about the collectives uh or the\nthe collections or whatever you call\nthese these uh hybrid teams now um\nfactor made a big move in the off season\nsigning a lot of riders. You know that\nwas a a big scoop grabbing Roman. Um\nthey grabbed up uh Peter Bakotch from\nCanyon which it broke my heart to see\nhim go. Uh but Peter is I mean he's\nalways a podium favorite. Um and a whole\nscoop of other riders.\n&gt;&gt; Nicole Fra as well going to factor.\n&gt;&gt; That's true.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they just saw them uh I think they\ndid like um meet up because they have\nthe factory here as well like the\noffices. So they all meet up and uh\ntalk.\n&gt;&gt; And David Miller, my uh my ex- teammate\non uh the Garmin from team from years\nago. He's actually uh running point for\nfactor these days. And he uh lives just\noutside of town here. So, I know that\nthere's a a big uh impetus here.\n&gt;&gt; Another Jono local. We've seen him done\ngravel a lot. He's he's done trucker 360\na couple of time and\n&gt;&gt; and I think he tried 560 last year.\n&gt;&gt; So, still uh I think once a racer,\nyou're always a racer.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I think that's why it's like doing long\ndistance is hard because it's just fun\nto race them and uh if you properly\ntrain for that, it can be really hard.\n&gt;&gt; Totally.\nThis is the chase group. No, Leon Quaser\nand uh Danoet.\nTwo strong riders\nnot far behind.\n&gt;&gt; No, they aren't. They are not giving up\nat all. Um you know, they it looks like\nthey've lost a bit of time now that\nMassware [clears throat] Schmidt\nrejoined. I think that three to four, um\nthey really started putting the metal\ndown. Um but those two guys can roll the\nflat, that's for sure.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. And have you seen in the screen\nthat's this is more of a flattish\nsection. It's like in between the two\nmountains that are uh around Jurona.\nThey'll hit a bit of the last mountains\nuh at the end of this stage and they'll\ngo by them tomorrow on the other stage\nas well. [clears throat] But\n&gt;&gt; it's it's hard on the flat as well\nbecause you're always turning twist and\nturning. You're never like a long\nstretch. So you have to be on your point\nas well.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. And some of these times these um\nand this is actually I I know this this\nis seared into my brain but we are on\nvery similar routes of the final of the\ntracker right now because um I just you\nknow once you're in the race and in that\nmoment it's like you can recognize every\nlittle thing it's seared in your brain\nbut um you know it's you got to be\ncareful on when it's been muddy um and\nyou're on pavement fully ripping and\nthen you turn onto a bridge or on into\nand off of the dirt. cars that have\npassed, the motors that have passed\nearlier, there's like a little mud\nstreak. Um, and you can easily slide\nout. So, they're still being a little\ncareful in these corners here.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we saw the finish of track uh 360\nlast year. A couple of those falls.\nExactly what you were talking about.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, and look at that shot.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we have um a lot of olive trees, a\nlot of chestnut trees as well. And um\ngavaras is pretty popular for their cork\ntrees. So when you see the tree that\nit's gotten on the bottom and it's red,\nall gavaras, it's where they take the\ncork for the wine uh photos.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, the the wine out here is so good.\nEvery time I I brought a bunch of stuff\nout for some friends here and so I got a\nbig empty suitcase right now and I think\nthere's going to be some Spanish wine\ncoming home. I mean, I I live in the\nwine region of California, and I always\nbring the Spanish wine home.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the Emperor wine. It's pretty\npretty popular. During Tracka, we go\nthrough a lot of the vineyards.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.\nSo, we got Sophia still on her own. Um,\nLucy Hemstead. This can't be right.\nI mean, we're seeing this live just like\nyou are at home, but it looks like that\ncan't be right. She was never in the\nconversation earlier. There must uh I'm\nguessing maybe there's been an issue\nwith uh maybe she had to cut the course\nto get home or something and just like\ntriggered a timing mat. Um I would\nassume that the real situation is Sophia\nat who's effectively zero and Rosa looks\nlike she's maybe brought back some time\non Sophia then if she's at 5:30. So uh\nmaybe Rosa's chopped off a minute.\nThat's what I'm guessing here and my my\nnapkin math. Uh hopefully we get a clear\npicture here in a second and we can uh\nmake sense of it.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Once they go to the timing tips,\nwe'll have exactly what's been\nhappening. And uh on your screen you see\nSophia Buyafany leading the women's race\nsince uh yeah almost the first part of\nthe the of the course. She's pretty\nstrong rider. Yeah, she definitely was\none of those riders who came out to to\nmake a point that she's done her\nhomework this winter and she's here to\nuh to win.\n&gt;&gt; They've been training in uh Tuxon. No,\nArizona.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Tucson is a bunch of the the\nsnowbirds. Um her and Keegan actually\njust got married this winter. Um you\nknow, they've been partners for a long\ntime, but they uh tied the knot. Um and\nthen they winter down in Tucson. Uh, a\nwhole bunch of the Americans do\n&gt;&gt; now riding in the same team.\n&gt;&gt; And now they're on the same team.\n&gt;&gt; So, here we have a better visual. Uh,\nyeah. So, they uh took out the timing\nmistake. We have Sophia, Rosa,\nand Morgan, but it looks like there's a\nlittle chase group coming up to Morgan\nnow. So, there might be a good fight for\nthat third podium spot.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. And as we say, uh, with these\nconditions, anything can happen. There's\nanother stage tomorrow, way faster\nstage, a bit more mountainy, like not\nsteep climbs, but all the time up and\ndown, up and down, more single tracks, a\nbit more rocky.\nYou can see Sophia on the screen.\nSophia has less than 24 kilometers to\ngo. So, yeah.\nYeah, I mean I think she'll be finishing\njust afternoon here. Uh just in time for\nher siesta and she'll go get a nice nap\nin and get ready to uh hopefully a\ndefense tomorrow. I mean I we're not\ngoing to count these chickens until they\nhatch though. But um you know it's also\nthe way that these things are moving.\nThat graphic is you know decently zoomed\nin. And here we have a real time check.\nSo, Rosa has brought back about a\nminute. Um, so I don't know if Sophia\nhad a quick little stop there or uh\n&gt;&gt; No, that's what we saw. Um, Sophia\nlooking back. Did you see like trying to\nlook back to see if she could see Rosa?\nMaybe at the feed station they gave her\na bit of information about what happened\nto Rosa.\n&gt;&gt; So,\n&gt;&gt; maybe she's checking in. Rosa is a good\nreally good uh rider on the flats on the\nclimbs and as you say she really wants\nto win as well. So\n&gt;&gt; I was thinking a lot about it just\nduring that uh that aid station break\nbut um the the Sophia Gomez Vijani Rosa\ncloser rivalry is one that's really\nstarting to build. It's been building\nsince last year and I think we're going\nto see a lot of it this year. Um they're\ngoing to be uh marketing each other even\nmore this year. Rosa is uh coming in for\nthe Lifetime Grand Prix, which Sophia\nhas normally put her stamp on uh as of\nthe past few years. So, I think we're\nstarting to see a very big budding\nrivalry. Um and the fact that Sophia is\nlooking over her shoulder is telling me\nshe's not confident.\n&gt;&gt; Maybe she's not feeling really strong,\nyou know, or or maybe she's waiting.\n&gt;&gt; No, she definitely wouldn't be waiting.\nI mean, this close. She's been alone for\nso long. Um, you know, it's just, uh,\nmaybe she's just trying to, you know,\nobviously just take stock and see what's\nhappening. But, um, I mean, now we're\nseeing the last that we have another\ntime check at Rosa at 120. So, she's\njust during our little conversation\nhere, she's chopped off another 5 to 10\nseconds. Um, the question is if Rosa is\nhaving this kind of pace, I mean, she's\ngot a head of steam, but she um, she\nmight run out of room.\n&gt;&gt; 23 km. Um, this part suits a bit of the\nriders that like the flats. I don't know\nif Sophia likes the flat. I don't know\nher that well, but I know Rosa loves it\nand she just puts her head down and uh\nyeah, looks at the finish line. Maybe\nshe wants to win. So,\n&gt;&gt; yeah. I mean, it's it ain't over till\nit's over. Um, I know Rosa uh is\nmeticulous. Sophia is as well. They're\nboth infamous for their attention to\ndetail, but Rosa has really focused on\naerodynamics and especially she's been\non training camp with the Canyon Tram\nwomen where she also moonlights as a\nroad racer. Um, so I know she's been\ntucked in that arrow position. Uh, I've\nseen her on a time trial bike a little\nbit. So, um, I'm sure Rose is very\noptimized for this.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, really powerful rider. Now, we're\nseeing the men, the four still riding\ntogether. This is the chase group on the\nscreen. Dan Soete and Leon Quaser.\nTwo strong riders as well trying to\nbridge to the front group that we have.\nMatt Beers, Mattswords,\nWalt Alamman, and Roman Bardett.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. And they're really just biting\ntheir time. You know, the way that this\ncourse is laid out is it just doesn't um\nit doesn't make for a move right now. It\nwas the initial selections and then uh I\nthink we're kind of waiting for the\nfinal here. Um\nthe only thing I would kind of expect to\nsee until the the final really kicks off\nis seeing Specialized start to to one\ntwo that group\n&gt;&gt; if you were in that group. What would\nyou do? Oh. Um, honestly, I would, uh,\nat this point have to start, uh, shortch\nchanging my turns. Knowing that, you\nknow, I'm not the a specialist sprinter,\num, and that there's a lack of climbing\nto come. I mean, I would be having to go\nall in on that hill towards the finish\nis probably where I would have to to\nbank everything. Um, and honestly, I\nwould know that I can't get away from\nall four or all other three. So, if I\nwere Roman, for example, I think is\nbetter than if it was me because we were\nboth climbing type riders. Um, I would\ntry to attack but take one of the\nspecialized guys with me because then it\neffectively would block the other\nspecialized rider. Um, and you could\nideally solidify a second place. Um, and\nthen you can try to manipulate. You\nwould have a one-on-one scenario. So, I\nwould actually try to break away with\none of the specialized riders and turn\nthat team number into uh an advantage\nfor myself.\nYeah. And also a thing that's different\nfrom the road. No, because in the road\nyou have the radio so you have you know\nwhat's happening. You know the bridges\nlike the time differences and then also\nyou have the coach letting you know what\nyou should do because uh especially days\nlike today know that you've waste so\nmuch energy.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Sugar is not getting to your head\nand making decisions when you're so\ntired and so concentrated you never like\nsometimes you don't make the the right\ndecision and looking back it's like oh I\nshould have done this and should have\ndone that. So that's the thing about\ngravel that I love.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. No, it's figuring it all and yeah\nthese guys they are they have no idea\nwhat's happening in the race around\nthem. They only the only information\nthey have is what they can see with\ntheir own eyes right now. Um, so yeah, I\nmean that that tactic I just laid out, I\nmean I'm sure Roman and Maser Schmidt\nare kind of they understand that they\nare following the same line. I mean that\nis world tour level tactics. um you know\nand Dan I believe Dan has played in the\nworld tour if I'm not or wow wow element\nno um\n&gt;&gt; no I maybe years ago but I've known him\nfrom mountain bike for a for a while\n&gt;&gt; and this is where actually Matt Beers is\nat a bit of a disadvantage and he is he\nwill self admit he is he is a student of\nthe game he is learning fast he is uh\nreally starting to come into his own but\num his his pure tactical sense is coming\nfrom mountain biking is\ngenerally his weak point at the moment.\nOf course, it's it's changing season by\nseason, but um you know, he's his\ntechnical prowess is phenomenal, but um\nyou know, if I were Roman or or W, I\nwould have to start working them over\nmentally.\n&gt;&gt; Okay. Now, yeah, we've seen\nall the riders taking their turn, maybe\ngiving poker faces and trying to do\nshorter turns. Yeah, there's definitely\ncollaboration is still there. No one's\nreally playing games. 35k to go. So,\nthey're thinking 1 hour, you know.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. On the women's side, 21k\nto go.\n&gt;&gt; And again, this is all I mean, I\nrecognize all of this. This is all truck\nrecon for the so also for us viewers at\nhome. I mean, we're seeing potential\nscenarios that could line out a month in\ntime in uh one of the world's most\nprestigious races. Uh the way it's\nraced, the way the riders are taking the\ncorners, uh situations that could\nevolve. So, um I'm you know, this is a\nbit of a dress rehearsal for what to for\nwhat we can expect in a few weeks.\n&gt;&gt; And also for me, maybe I'm even if I'm\nin the fight at truck, I'm seeing how\nthis is playing in the front. So, I'm\nseeing what these riders are doing. So,\nmaybe I'm getting a little cheat code\ntonight.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's good. But I think if you're\naiming to be top contender on track, you\nhave to be here at the moment because\nit's the perfect scenario.\nAlmost every rider that's on the top on\ngravel is here in Stantal today. Some\nare in top form, some maybe are just\ncoming to train and to see the terrain,\nbut it's the perfect scenario to get\nahead on track.\n&gt;&gt; Yep. Exactly.\nSo we have W Alamman in the front, Matt\nWoods going to the back now.\n&gt;&gt; It just looked like he dropped off. It's\na little choppy, but Matt Beers is\nlooking behind. A little concerned\nthere. It looks like we'll see once the\npicture picks up again.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, connection here usually um it's\nnot because they're really near the\nairport,\n&gt;&gt; Jon airport. So it's always a bit\ntricky.\nwith the connection,\n&gt;&gt; but our camera guys with the drone with\nthe Motos are doing an incredible job\nfor us to see the whole race\n&gt;&gt; from today.\n&gt;&gt; Looks like Master Schmidt is unclipping\nthere and kicking his bike a bit. I\nwonder if, you know, I saw a few of\nthese guys running road cleat. Uh they\nlove that platform and the stability of\nit, but on a muddy race, oh, I don't\nknow if that was a good idea. So, um\n&gt;&gt; I think for none of the class marks, I\nwould go with uh road pedals. You never\nknow what's going to happen.\n&gt;&gt; I know a lot of the road riders\nespecially love doing the road shoes\nwith road leads. I think it's a bad\nidea.\n&gt;&gt; I I would never do it for a Gerard built\ncourse either because you know he's\ngoing to do something just to screw with\npeople. Um, and here we actually saw,\nyou know, at we actually saw right there\non the back though that Matt and uh Matt\nSchmidt were having a little chat too.\nThey were like looking at each other.\nSo, I'm wondering if they're starting to\ntalk about uh how to play this thing\nout.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's their first re uh year riding\nin the same team, so they want to know\neach other, play the tactics correctly,\ntalk about it, and uh yeah, we will see.\nYeah, they're just I mean they're the\nultimate professionals. Um I'm sure it's\ndiplomatic, but they also uh they've\nonly been teammates for probably a\nlittle less than a week now. They're\nfeeling each other out, learning them,\nand you know, maybe even to some degree\nstarting to establish a pecking order.\n&gt;&gt; We have uh both of the groups here on\nour screen, leaders group with a chasing\ngroup. What do\n&gt;&gt; you know? Massor Schmidt is really\nhaving an issue here. He's uh looking\ndown a lot. He was unclipping. Now he's\nhopping up and down. He just banged his\nrear wheel wondering. He's trying to get\nsome problem solving for Matt. Um\nhe's having Matt check out the rear\nwheel if maybe there's a soft leak or\nsomething or something is wrong with his\ngears. But um\nyeah, Matt Massawware Schmidt is not not\ncontent in just riding right now.\nIt's the worst moment for something to\nhappen. No, mechanicals are never good,\nbut at the end of a stage,\nI mean, we saw him crash earlier, you\nknow. Yeah, we're going back there. It\nlooks like he's trying to get some\nsomething wrong with his shifting, I'm\nguessing. I mean, he was kind of looks\nlike he was\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, his gears are skipping around. So,\nit sounds like I'm guessing his rear\nderailer is a bit off. Maybe we saw him\ncrash on his drivetrain side early in\nthe day. Um I'm wondering if he's been\ndealing with skipping gears all day and\nstill making that amazing chase back. Um\nbut skipping gears are the worst feeling\nin the world. You just can't even keep\nthe power down. Um but the fact that\nhe's kicking it and then he was having\nMatt kind of spray some of his water uh\nin there trying to clean it for him\n&gt;&gt; back in the front.\n32 kilometers to go. Yeah, as you say,\nless than an hour we'll have them here\nin San Gregori.\n&gt;&gt; And as far as the racing this year, I\nmean, Roman has already won a race in\nAustralia at Rattle Gravel. Matt Beers\nhas already won I saw him win a uh a\nseason opening race down in South Africa\nlike one of his local races but everyone\nin South Africa is prime fitness right\nnow with it being summer. Um so we have\nthey've already opened their accounts\nthis year. They've also got that that\nrace touch you know from\n&gt;&gt; Wild Element just had a mountain bike\nstage race uh Mediterranean epic last\nweekend as well. So four or three day\nstage race. Um,\n&gt;&gt; so that's also something, you know,\nearly season it's kind of, you know, you\nkind of always race into it's it takes a\nlittle bit to get that touch back, that\nthat finesse, the the muscle suppleness,\nthe the acceler those micro\naccelerations from the group. So all\nthese guys are actually race fit except\nfor maybe Schmidt.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, he's I just saw a post yesterday.\nHe's been doing a lot of rollers because\nhe's doing um heat training.\nI don't know for what event that is for,\nbut yeah, it's not the same being in the\nroad on the gravel uh and on the like on\nthe\n&gt;&gt; home trainer.\n&gt;&gt; No, the heat training is uh pretty\nstandardized now. Pretty much guys just\ndo it all year. Uh there's a whole host\nof hormonal benefits that come from it.\nUm you know, we the the there's a it's\nit's very beneficial. Uh the running\njoke is it's the poor man's altitude. Uh\nbasically if you can create a fever uh\nyou have a whole slew of uh um blood\nplasma volume natural hemoglobin uh\nenhancements that happen uh by creating\na an extra stress. Um so it's pretty\ncommon place in the world tour and in\nelite anything mountain bike gravel now\nto um basically ride the rollers in a\nsome sort of a paint suit or thermal\njet. It's it's horrible. It's it makes\nme wonder like what is is running really\nthat worth it? That's not why I want to\nride a bike, but um it's common place\nnowadays. Um and it uh it makes a big\ndifference, especially when the\nmountains are all snowy and you can't go\ntrain in Andor.\n&gt;&gt; No. Yeah, it's been, as we said, harsh\nwinter. A lot of uh people around you\ntook out their their home trainers\nbecause Yeah. Getting wet one day is\nfine, but getting wet for a month at\nsome point is like, \"No, I'm done with\nthe rain.\" And if I have to take out the\nrollers, I'm not riding.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. So that little graphic is off.\nMessor Schmidt is not with uh not ahead\nof the group there. Um that's just yeah,\nnow he's back with them. Um and that's\nanother defining feature that usually\nfeatures in the truck is that little\nroundabout down by the river in the\nunderpass. That's always a fun little\nspicy spot. And it was actually right\nafter there, it's right where these\nriders are now uh two years ago that uh\nthat stick kicked up in Matia de Mary's\nwheel and broke his bike which allowed\nRob and I to go on to fight it out for\nthat. the truck win. Um, so and but\nthat's just an example of you. It ain't\nover till it's over. I mean, literally\nsomething benign as a stick ripping up\nthrough your gears and your day is done.\n&gt;&gt; yeah, Mati Mari, one of the first pure\ngravel riders. Uh he loves Glasmark\nevent. He's always uh been here. Now\nhe's with a new team. He created a team,\nthe grits. It's always fun to see their\nsocials. uh how they like rent the house\nand the all they cook and yeah it's just\nI think it's the spirit of gravel. So\n&gt;&gt; Matia is great. I was talking to him\nyesterday. He looks uh he's in the race\ntoday. It sounds like he's been nursing\na bit of a a cold. He's not at top\nshape, but you know he's Matia is a no\nexcuses guy. I'll make the excuse for\nhim because he's not going to complain\nabout it. He just gets on with the job\nand uh has a great time doing it. And he\nhe always finds a silver lining which I\nreally appreciate about Media. He's he's\ngoing to find a story out there somehow,\neven if it's not a result. Um, but he's\n[music] been extra busy creating a team\nand he owns the Hills. So, he's a race\norganizer, a team manager, and a pro\nracer.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the Hills is the next uh Graalert\nSeries event that we'll have in Italy in\nthe middle of March. Uh, epic ride, epic\nrace, epic events. Uh last year the best\nimages I think came from there.\nEverybody was really muddy and uh Matia\nloves his climbing so it's a climbers\ncourse but any anything can happen.\n&gt;&gt; I would love to make it there someday.\nIt looks phenomenal. Um yeah the images\nthat come out it's you know it's as an\norganizer you don't want the mud because\nof the logistic school problems but also\nfrom the promotionals that come after\nthe race it's pretty iconic. Yeah. And\nwith them you you know it's always going\nto be fun. Uh now I've seen a post as\nwell that they're doing an afterparty on\nuh Sunday. They're going to do like\nbeers and uh potato chips like fruits\nand yeah you know with batas there's\nalways happening. So yeah go to their\nsocial see what's on. There's going to\nbe a party on Jirona on uh Sunday. We\nhave a couple of events as well. There's\na meet and greet, the specialized\noff-road uh racing team on Veladrome, I\nthink from 2:30 to 4. So, if you're\naround Juraccom, there's uh still more\nhappening after the race.\n&gt;&gt; There's always something. Yeah, I mean,\nwe're planning some stuff with the\nCanyon DT Swiss team as well. And\nthey're staying the whole week after in\nJerona. Uh so, it's Yeah, there's always\nsomething to do here. That's for sure.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we don't get bored.\nHopefully the weather gets better and we\nget a bit more dry riding, a bit more\nsun, and I think the spring is going to\nbe phenomenal.\n&gt;&gt; I think tomorrow is going to be\nphenomenal. I think this is all baking\nout. I mean, I would assume that, you\nknow, it's just kind of been not too\nmuch rain except for yesterday, correct?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it stopped for a while. Well, uh\nwe had a wind thing uh situation going\non midweek and then the rain situation\nuh yesterday, but I\n&gt;&gt; So now the sun's out. Like we might just\nget uh this might bake down and I that's\ngoing to make tomorrow so fast. Less\ndust. I mean, we might see record speeds\ntomorrow.\n&gt;&gt; We have Sophia Gomez Via leading the\nwoman's race on our screen. She has less\nthan 15 km to go. Rosa closer was\nchasing her with a bit more than a\nminute behind.\n&gt;&gt; This is Rosa now.\nOkay, she's chopped off another 5\nseconds, but uh she's starting to run\nout of room.\n&gt;&gt; She's back down to a minute. So, Rosa is\n&gt;&gt; on a mission there.\n&gt;&gt; She's on a mission. She is coming back.\nUm\n&gt;&gt; we're going to see how much Sophia has\nleft in the tank. Um, and Rosa, I mean,\n15k, that's at this speed they're\nriding, that's less than 30 minutes. So,\nuh, it's going to be tight. Um, you\nknow, there's no more feed zones. So,\nyou know, Sophia and Rosa are, you know,\nthey don't both have any more chances\nfor, uh, hydration mix, any more gels,\nany more feeds unless they stop at a\nneutral water point, which they wouldn't\ndo, especially with this on the line.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. And unless they have\nsomebody on the course telling them uh\ndifferences, they don't know where\n&gt;&gt; what's happening, how far away they are.\n&gt;&gt; My gosh, my I'm getting excited now. I\nkind of I kind of said I thought I\nthought the women's race was just kind\nof done. I thought it was just one by\none. Um\n&gt;&gt; we have a pursuit on our hands. Uh\nthat's that's pretty cool. So uh you\nknow,\n&gt;&gt; yeah, Morgan was uh behind them as well.\nWe'll see a timing point once she\ncrosses that mat. We also had uh like a\nlot of like chasing groups.\n&gt;&gt; Here you can see the graphic.\nSo Sophia was\nthe Okay, so Sophia's the green. What\nwe're seeing here, Sophia's the green.\nAt the first checkpoint, they were even\ntime, correct? And then through the big\nmountainous section, Sophia gained 2 and\n1/2 minutes when Rosa reportedly\ncrashed. Um and now over the flat\nsection uh between feed zone and water\nstation 2 uh Rosa has pulled back a\nminute and a half of that 2 minute 2 and\na half minute gap. So\n&gt;&gt; wow this is going to be interesting till\nthe end.\n&gt;&gt; Yep. And again remember even no matter\nwhat happens now even if Sophia holds on\nfor the stage victory which is a very\nrighteous celebration in its own. I mean\nnow we're going to be talking a game of\nseconds coming in for stage two\ntomorrow. So the GC is the the GC battle\nis already established for tomorrow.\n&gt;&gt; And now you can see the terrain still\nbit wet, little bit muddy. Um they'll\nhave the crossing of the river not far\naway. We will see what the decision is.\nMaybe they'll go by going by themselves.\nThey go off the bike and walk it. I\nthink it's a safer way. But maybe we see\nthem riding. Uh for sure they've been\ngone and reckoned that part because it's\nthe homework you have to do. I think at\nleast the first part of the course you\nneed to know and the last part of the\ncourse you need to know. So I'm sure\nthey know it by hand and uh we'll see\nwhich decision they've done.\n&gt;&gt; So as they finish in St. Gregory here,\nthey do not do the final single track of\nthe track, do they? No. Okay. Cuz this\nis where Sophia would pull back. Um, but\nif Sophia doesn't have that and it's\nmore open, do they have any more single\ntracks today?\n&gt;&gt; Okay. So, that's a that's a disadvantage\nto Sophia as she is the more uh\ntechnical rider, the more mountain bike\nbased rider and Rosa is more of the uh\nthe power rider.\n&gt;&gt; They do have a tiny single track, but I\nwould not call it like single target.\nJust maybe 200 m long and there's\nnothing really technical. And then\nthey'll turn left, hit the river\ncrossing that um Tasmark organization\nhad to rebuild because it was uh gone by\nthe loss that we had. So it's been\nrebuilt so the riders can't cross it.\nAnd uh from there on it's pretty flat,\nnot champagne gravel because it's pretty\nbroken, but pretty fast gravel till they\nget to San Dur.\nAnd then how far is the final dirt to\nthe finish? How much pavement until they\ncome in right in here where we are?\n&gt;&gt; 100 m.\n&gt;&gt; Okay. So, they're on gravel till the\nvery end.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. They've uh we've changed the\nfinish points because having more people\nwe wanted to make it wider. So, it's a\nbit different from last year, but it\njust changes\n150 m. So, they're come from the aspel,\nturn left, another turn, and then\nthey'll hit the\nreally fast downhill here that also\ntrying to keep up with the riders.\n&gt;&gt; So, we are Yeah, this is all within uh\nrest uh rest zone rides. You know, these\nare the the\n&gt;&gt; if you look at the the heat map on\nJirona, this is bright bright orange. I\nmean, this is what everyone rides all\nthe time. Um, they're going to be on\nthis path for a little bit and then they\nkind of uh cross back into farm rail\nlands for just a second and then they\nhit that kicker that we were talking\nabout earlier in the men's race. Uh,\nwhich would be the final launch pad if\nyou were together in a group. Um,\n&gt;&gt; yeah, bases are really famous around\nDana. It's where everybody goes. It's\nwhere the train tracks used to go. So,\nit's a really good system to do with the\nfamily, do with the friends. Usually,\nthey're pretty chill except when the the\nevents are going on.\nAnd we are getting more into\npopulations, too. So, you know, this is\na popular track. We're starting to see\nsome walkers and stuff. I saw Sophia\njust yell out there track, you know, uh\njust making sure she's safe and that\nthere's, you know, no dog walker or\nsomething like that on the trail.\n&gt;&gt; Sounds like she's trying to get a little\nbit of information from the moto.\n&gt;&gt; Motos know they're not allowed to share\nany informations with the riders. Uh we\nsaw what was it three years ago that uh\nthe leader of the truck 360 woman was uh\nriding and her GPS just shut down and\nthe the routes are not marked. You you\nhave to follow a GPS so it's really\nimportant and she was yelling to the\nmotor riders like please give me a ride\nand then yeah really uh cool anecdotes\nfrom that. So here, look at all this\nnow. She's these are just, you know,\nregular folks on their Saturday stroll.\nBut, uh, when a game of seconds and\nSophia maybe gets held up on a bridge, I\nmean, this is 1 second, 2 seconds. Like,\nthis is all going advantage with the\nchase. Um, of course, it's advantage\nSophia. She's in the front, but um, you\nknow, this is all these little things\nstart to add up.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but this is gravel riding. The\nroutes are open to\n&gt;&gt; 100%. So you have to know that we do put\nsigns on the all the whole track uh\nsaying to the public that uh there's\ngoing to be an event from that hour to\nthat hour. So the riders there know that\nthe race is happening and usually some\nmotos come before them to check and they\nadvise the people to to just be careful.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. And this is a it looks like a\nmen's group here that we had for a\nsecond. Um this looks bigger though.\nThis is not the front group unless those\ntwo chasers have caught on.\nSo, what we're seeing here is uh I guess\nthe the two chasers uh\nbut it looks like they might have caught\non to some guys from\n&gt;&gt; woman maybe\n&gt;&gt; some woman or yeah maybe there's not a\nshort course in the Sabbal it's all one\ncourse um unless maybe there were some\nguys who came back to them I mean that\nback group was lingering back there may\num if I if we can see a kind of a dark\ngray jersey ped that's the thing these\nguys they all just announced you know\nthe season opener. It's a brand new\njersey and they dropped it yesterday on\nsocial media and we need to know what it\nlooks like.\n&gt;&gt; We need rider kits. We need rider kids.\n&gt;&gt; You know, the way that they're riding\nthough, I'm not seeing just like some\nwomen pro hanging on like it's uh\nI think that they got absorbed by a\nchase group. I think\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I do agree with you.\nSo, we have woman on one side of the\nscreen and then we have the men's chaser\non the other side of the screen\nnavigating on the puddles\n&gt;&gt; we've had for today. I think it's just\nbeen\n&gt;&gt; you can see them on their jerseys. It's\nbeen pretty muddy.\nSo less than 11k to go for Sophia Gomez\nand less than 24 kilometers for the men.\nSo we're going to see the replay. So how\nthe chasing group got absorbed by the\nother chasing group.\nAll right. So, here they are coming in.\nIt looks like a Scott Rider.\nI don't know the blue jersey.\nYou know, with all the mud, you can't\nsee the numbers. Uh we were having to\nrely on timing chips, unfortunately. But\nit was clear that uh a few of these uh\nthat strong chasing group has come in.\nSo now we have a battle for fifth at\nleast.\n&gt;&gt; This is the group fighting for fifth.\n&gt;&gt; And as we were saying on gravel if the\nones in front start thinking about the\ntactics and chasing group can come back.\nUh is it a what is the podium for the\ngravel earth rides? It's it's usually\ntop five or they even go 10 sometimes.\n&gt;&gt; Top 10. Yeah. for the states the\ncommunity. Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And then for the whole uh two days\ntogether, it's gonna be top 10. So,\n&gt;&gt; okay.\n&gt;&gt; Everybody can fight for the top 10. It's\nnice to do the champagne showers and\ncelebrate have your time.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. I like to\nYeah. In the US, we call it the wide\nangle podium. You need the wide angle\nwith with your phone. Um but uh yeah I I\nreally appreciate in the US we often do\nfive instead of three which you know top\nfive is always pretty prestigious.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah they used to do it on the mountain\nbike as well and we've seen riders last\nyear complaining about that because\neverybody works together. It's a whole\nteam and you want to celebrate with your\nteam. So I think at least five\n&gt;&gt; is fair.\n&gt;&gt; Well and even the traditional podium\nit's fine to have two riders on either\nside kind of sandwiching the podium. I\nthink it looks good um you know\nphotogenically too. Yeah, and everybody\nhere makes an effort. We've been seeing\nthe top uh of the race. Here is the\nriver crossing. We're going to see Rosa\nclosure navigating it.\n&gt;&gt; She's in the pursuit. There is no\nrunning that it is.\n&gt;&gt; See, this is not a rocky part. I told\nyou. Yeah, this is what I uh we couldn't\ndo yesterday because rocks are\nhumongous. She's a really good rider and\nyou can tell how technical this part is\nbecause that part is really broken.\n&gt;&gt; Yep. I mean, she had to try. There was\nuh she's in a pursuit now in a game of\nseconds. Uh we don't\n&gt;&gt; uh less than a minute.\n&gt;&gt; Okay. And we didn't see how Sophia went\nthrough it. Um if she had to dismount or\nanything as well,\nbut 10k and about a minute gap. So think\nit's looking like Sophia will hold on um\nall you know barring any any\ncatastrophes.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this part is uh pretty wide\ngravel. They have the kicker uh that we\ntalked about before and then is just\nstraight to San Gregori. So, we'll have\nthem here pretty pretty soon. I'm\nexcited to see this fight and uh yeah,\ntomorrow another day.\nSo there you can see uh Rosa has opted\nfor her Canyon Grizzle bike which is\nnormally an adventure platform [music]\nbut it boasts extra wide tire clearance.\nSo um that means that Rosa is that's\ntelling me that Rosa was either\nconcerned about the mud or she is\nrunning somewhere in the 2.2 to 2.0 tire\nrange. Uh extra wide there on that\nCanyon Grizzle. It's a little bit of a\nweight penalty, but the the clearance is\nphenomenal.\n&gt;&gt; I think that's a good choice for today.\n&gt;&gt; It's been pretty technical, course,\nmuddy, rocky,\nlots of photos and uh yeah, it's uh I\nthink a adventure bike. It's a bit\n&gt;&gt; bit better option.\n&gt;&gt; So, here in the screen you have the\nleader.\n&gt;&gt; No, now they switch to closer closer.\nShe's the chasing. She's chasing\nSophiago Pigafany. That's in the leading\nposition at the moment with less than 9\nkm to go.\n&gt;&gt; Yep. It's down to 55. Oh,\n&gt;&gt; she went the wrong way\nhere. Uh\n&gt;&gt; she doesn't know.\n&gt;&gt; No, because this is a Y. Usually on\ntrack you do the rides, but uh it's a\nprivate road for the factory that\nthey've been trying to close.\n&gt;&gt; So, it takes you to the same place, but\nuh it's pretty broken on the uphill.\n&gt;&gt; Well, a little hiccup there.\n&gt;&gt; And that's the thing sometimes, I think,\nbeing a local rider that you ride these\nuh gravel roads all the time. Sometimes\nyour m your mind just switches off and\nyou try to do what like whatever you're\nused to and sometimes you forget that\nyou have to look on the on the on your\nGPS to see the track.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, sometimes being too local can be a\ndetriment, I guess. Um and right there\nit looks like we just had a little\ngraphic. We were so focused on that that\nfight for the win there, but it looks\nlike Lissa Hartto and Sophie Wright have\nactually gapped Morgan Aguero. And\nMorgan has lost another 40 seconds to\nthe uh the fight for third there. So,\num, but we have a group of two coming in\nfor that final podium spot today so far.\n&gt;&gt; And now we have, uh, Sophie Wright as\nwell here, uh, fighting for third.\n&gt;&gt; Okay. Oh, and she\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Rosa closer fighting for second.\nAnd we have Sophie right uh, in third\nposition at the moment.\n&gt;&gt; So, the time gap. Yeah, it looked like\nLotus is no longer with her anymore.\nYeah, maybe the size point was a river.\n&gt;&gt; It's very possible. I mean, it's easy to\nslam something in there you can't see.\nHopefully, there's no mechanicals, but\nyou never know.\n&gt;&gt; For the ones that are tuning in, we have\nless than 8 km to go to the woman. We\nhave Sophia Gomez, Via on first, Rosa\ncloser chasing her for second position,\nand Sophie right on third position at\nthe moment. Yep. And then it looks like\nin the other 20 seconds to a hard and\nthen Morgan Morgan Aguero sitting in\nfifth.\n&gt;&gt; It's been a pretty good fight. Uh we've\nhad a bit of everything today.\nAnd it's also just telling me how hard\nthis track has been with the mud today\nbecause this is not a uh a vertically\nchallenging course after the that\nhalfway point. Um but they've all\nactually split quite a bit. So um it's\njust uh it's a lot of tired legs out\nthere early. This uh this rain, the\ncold, it made things very complicated\nthis morning. That is for [music] sure.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh and especially the beginning of\nthis stage uh with a bit of road then\nthe l gravel\n&gt;&gt; river crossing lots of mud navigating so\nthey have to be really tired.\nYou see here Rosa closer on the last\nseven kilometers of the course chasing\nSophia Gomez Vafany that's in the lead.\nThey're arriving in Sang Gregori\njust in a few minutes.\n&gt;&gt; And it's looking like that little bobble\nin the stream caused the Rosa to crow\ncreep right back over that minute gap\nthere. But um you know she's going to\nkeep going all the way to the line just\nknowing that tomorrow there's it can\ncome down to a game of seconds like\nshe's she's not going to just like bank\nsecond place today. Um, and so Sophia\nalso knowing that Rose is coming behind\nfor sure someone that specialized has\ngotten her the information somehow\nbecause she's, you know, been looking\nover her shoulder. Um, you know, so\nshe's actually got to keep pounding away\neven though she knows she's got today 5K\nto go. Um, she's got to go all the way\nto the line, too. She only gets to raise\nher arms in the last little minute.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely. It's the is the time\nwe see uh how each of them is pedalling\ndifferently. They're fighting the demons\non their head, maybe giving them uh each\nother just like pep talks like we can do\nit. Both know this part of the course.\nThey've raced it. There was the finish\nline of tracka that they did last year.\nTracka 200. Both they were racing each\nother. So they know what they have to\ndo. It's pretty short to the finish line\ntrying to be as aerial as possible.\nThey'll have the last kicker and it's\npretty flat to the finish line. So, we\njust saw um while we were talking uh one\nof the candy mechanics popped his head\naround the corner and took a picture.\nSo, that's just telling me that, you\nknow, it's also a race within the race\nfor the team staff. They have to service\nevery rider and race right back to the\nfinish for their the media personnel for\nthe photos, but also to catch their\nriders and, you know, cover them up, uh\nclean them off, um get them the recovery\nshakes and all of that. So, uh, the\nhustle is real for for the whole sport\nsupport support personnel out there.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. And also they're doing the feed\nfor the women and the men. So, the women\nwent first, but then they had to wait\nfor the men and then sprint to the\nfinish.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. It's a there, as you say, it's\nlike it's a team job.\n&gt;&gt; It's always a really difficult balance.\nSo, you have to have that difficult\nconversation on when do you cut it off.\nyou know, if if the riders have dealt\nwith a mechanical and they're too far\nbehind. I mean, they still want help.\nThey need a bottle, maybe they need\nmechanics, but if you have a rider in\nthe front, you know, like maybe this is\nan equation that happened with, you\nknow, we haven't seen Keegan Swson all\nday, but we have Specialized two in the\nleading front group. Um, they obviously\nhave to prioritize the win. So, I mean,\nKeegan, you know, I'm sure they'll leave\nsomeone there to help him, but, you\nknow, you have to make these difficult\ndecisions as we start banking on teams\nsupporting more and more riders.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a good insight that\nsometimes we don't think about, but\nbigger teams might have the personnel to\nhelp that, but smaller teams sometimes\neven like ask their parents to go and\nhelp them. And then\n&gt;&gt; just getting into the fit zones [music]\nand all the like logistic to get there.\nIt's it's complicated.\n&gt;&gt; But of course, you know, if you are out\nof the the very front running, um then\nit's okay to stop and fill your own\nwater bottle, too.\nBut yeah, we haven't seen Keegan all\nday, you know, and his his big debut on\nSpecialized. So, I'm curious to hear\nwhat the story is with him. You know,\nhe's the consmate professional. I'm sure\nhe showed up having done his homework.\nUm, so we'll get that information, I'm\n&gt;&gt; Here you can see the map with the\nleaders on the screen. On the bottom of\nthe screen, you see you have Sophie\nright L um fighting for the third\nposition almost in Sang Gregory. So\nwe'll get to see them pretty soon.\nyou know, and it looks like uh Gerard\nand the Class Mark team got their timing\nright because, you know, there looks\nlike there's only about 13K separating\nthe the front women from the front men.\nSo, um as soon as Sophia crosses the\nline here, we're going to be treated to\nthe that final of the men and that uh\nthat four rider group. And we still\ndon't know what's happened um and what\nwho's what's being played out there. Um\nbut it's going to be an action-packed\nnext 30 minutes here. Yeah, as an\norganization I uh I know they work hard\non trying to you can always like try to\nsee the scenario that can happen but you\nnever know what's going to happen and\nlately it's been working out. The woman\ncan uh have come before the men but yeah\nit's always a tricky situation. You you\nwant to have both of them their own\nspace. So\n&gt;&gt; here's the wall.\n&gt;&gt; Here's your spot.\n&gt;&gt; This is Yeah. Yeah. This is such a cool\nspot for me. Um, I used to train on this\nwhen I was the that road pro in Jerona\nback in 2006 78. Um, but oh, this thing\nis so steep. The camera never does it\njustice. I can't believe she's actually\nsitting down right now. Uh, that's just\nthat's power. Um,\n&gt;&gt; but uh\n&gt;&gt; yeah, it's a small kicker now to what\n200 50 long, but it is\n&gt;&gt; if you sprint it. I mean, it's I guess\nit's around a minute, maybe just under.\nUh, but it's steep. It's really steep.\nUm, so I mean this is a good visual for\num if there's that men's group still\ntogether coming in within the next half\nhour. Um, that is the launch pad and\nthere's no single track after. I mean if\nyou launch that you have to uh hold on\nfor you know 3 kilometers like 5 minutes\nmostly downhill um all the way in.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. And it's not to Jona they finished\nin Sangrei that is the town before. So\nfrom here on they have just 3 km to go.\nPretty smooth gravel to the end and\nwe'll have them here soon.\nSo Sophie Wright has actually brought\nback a decent chunk of time on Rosa too.\nShe's had a good second half.\n&gt;&gt; I saw her warm up this morning. She was\nriding from Jirona to Sangori on the\nroad and uh she looked really focused.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean 40 seconds. I mean they're\non the hill at the same time there. So\num again I would expect that this is the\nthe final finishing order is what we're\nseeing right now. You can even see in\nour graphic that uh the finish line is\nin sight. So you know all these women\nare very excited and they are ready to\nbe done. Yes, we have Sophia Gomez, Via\nleading the race. Rosa closer chasing\nreally closely, less than a minute\nbehind and then Sophie right on third of\nthe moments. Uh, chasing Rosa closer\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean, this is always the moment\nwhere, you know, you've used all your\ngels, you're probably out of water. The\ncheck engine light is definitely on and\nit's flashing red, but um, you know,\nthey they just got to just got to get in\nnow. I mean, you just know, you know,\nthe pain is very temporary at this\npoint.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they've been in this position\nplenty of times, but yeah, it's the\nfirst of the season to almost all of the\nof them, so has to hurt.\nYeah. Sophie is having a a great little\nrally comeback. Um, you know, I I do\nwonder if Rose\nI hope I wonder if Rosa had, you know,\nshe went all in trying to catch Sophie\non that epic time trial by, but it looks\nlike she might be actually her engine\nmight be the one starting to to shut\ndown here a little bit. Not Not\nsurprising given how much of a gap she\ntook out a minute on Sophia over that\nflat section in the middle of the\ncourse.\n&gt;&gt; And also, we heard uh she had a fall and\na fall always gets a lot of energy from\nyour body. You don't notice it till like\nwhen it starts coming. You're like,\n\"Okay, maybe sometimes when you hit the\nground, you have to take some gels, take\nsome more energy because your body takes\na bit on it.\"\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, she'll really need to take care of\nherself tonight. Um, you know, sometimes\nit's the day after too is you sleep, you\nget a little stiff. You know, she's\ngoing to have to do an extra warm up\ntomorrow uh to to make ready to make\nsure she's ready to fight.\n&gt;&gt; So, we are hearing now Uriel on the\nspeaker. Less than 2 kilometers to go.\nThey're almost here in the finish line.\nFinish line getting packed. We're seeing\neverybody walk by. Uh a lot of people\ncome to watch. It's our it's our home\nrace. A lot of people from Durona want\nto see uh their idols and their friends\ncome come here. So if you're around,\nplease come by and [music] say hi.\nThere's food and drinks and there's\ngoing to be plenty of show to go.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. I always love early season races.\nThe energy is just so palpable. It's,\nyou know, it's just a different anticip\neveryone's been, they haven't been\nracing over the winter. Like, you know,\nby the end of the season, you know,\neveryone's kind of tired. The race is\nlike just they have like a little bit\nless of like that stareyed look than\nright now just everyone. They're coming\nout of hibernation and they you could\nfeel the excitement on the start line\nthis morning. So,\n&gt;&gt; yeah, I really like the first one of the\nseason and especially if it's a stage\nrace because you get a second try. You\nknow, sometimes traveling for a event\nthat lasts for a day and then if it\ndon't it doesn't go okay to you, you're\nlike a bit of disappointed. But to have\nanother opportunity the next day, it\nit's it's nice to have\n&gt;&gt; the tickers just changed to final\nkilometer. So, they can see each other\n&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. So, can see Rosa closer\nnearby. Maybe she'll give it a bit of a\nharder push to get it. That's a bit of a\nenergy back on your legs when you can\nsee the rider in front of you. She's\nmotivated now. We're going to have\nSophia almost here. Four hours of 15\nminutes of racing and she's on the final\nkilometer of stage one of La Santal.\n&gt;&gt; So they were doing just under 30 km an\nhour in these conditions in the mud with\nthe slow the tacky dirt. I mean that is\nthat is impressive.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yesterday you No, two days ago you\ncould see the Pyrenees. We've had a lot\nof snow,\n&gt;&gt; but today it's a bit uh cloudy.\nCamera guy trying to clear the lens from\nall the due diligence\n&gt;&gt; he's seen today\n&gt;&gt; just so we can see all the dirt. It has\nbeen a mucky day.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Kudos to the moto riders as well.\nto give us this images to letting us see\nthe whole race on our screen. So, we\njust saw Sophia Gomez Via go by on our\ndoor. So, she is the winner of the first\nstage of Santal. Here you have it on\nyour screen.\n&gt;&gt; All right. Look at that race. Sophia\nGomez, the winner of the first stage of\nLa Santal by the tracker. That's got to\nfeel good to get the open the account,\nright? Um you saw she sprinted all the\nway to the line though knowing it's a\nstage race. She didn't put her arms up\nuntil she crossed that finish line and\nafter cuz uh every second counts right\nnow.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Now is the feeling. She's happy,\ntired, but she delivered. She had to do\nwhat she did what she had to do.\n&gt;&gt; She's such a consistent rider and she\nknows how to always manage her\nequipment. Uh Sophia Gomez Vijani rarely\nseems to have mechanicals. It's very\nrare. So, um you know that I bet uh\ntoday a big part of her success was\ncaring for her equipment.\n&gt;&gt; We just saw a change. Uh Sophie rides, I\nthink.\nLet's see the finish shot.\n&gt;&gt; So, no. Rosa closer in second position.\n&gt;&gt; She doesn't look too content. Now she's\nshaking her head.\n&gt;&gt; A little frustrated.\n&gt;&gt; Sophia, first position.\n&gt;&gt; so second position for Rosa closer in\nthe first stage of Santa Val by the\ntracka. And on third position here on\nyour skin, Sophie Wright doing an\nawesome comeback from the [music]\nchasing group. She was Morgan and\n&gt;&gt; she was never even in the front with\nthose girls. first selection of three\nwas uh Sophia and Morgan and Rosa. Um so\nI mean gosh it'd be really interesting\nto look at her time splits. I mean she's\nit's clear she's got a pair of legs on\nher right now.\n&gt;&gt; So now we have the podium Sophia Gomez\nVa then 57 seconds behind you have Rosa\ncloser and a minute and 59 seconds\nbehind you have Sophie Wright. So that's\nyour podium for the Santaal first stage.\n&gt;&gt; More to come tomorrow.\n&gt;&gt; Oh yeah, that's going to be really\nexciting.\n&gt;&gt; You can see this is the finished\nstraight\nof the Sang Gregori\nLa Pina. Espacio La Pina.\nWe see here Sophia Vijany done a great\njob. [laughter]\nSoaking it all in. It's been a really\nreally hard day.\n&gt;&gt; We can hear there uh getting the riders\ninto the finish line.\nGoodbye.\n&gt;&gt; That's the finished straits. We're still\nwaiting for the men to come. Less than\n11 11 kilometers for them. They've been\num riding for 3 hours and 20 minutes.\nNow we see the sun come out and uh yeah,\nwe're going to have them shortly in our\nscreen, but we're going to keep with the\nwoman finish.\n&gt;&gt; And then the second one that you went in\nthe water.\nSo, this is the part I like the most\nwhen the riders are just\ntalking about the race. We see here\nMorgan Aguire arriving on the finish\nline.\n&gt;&gt; It's not as muddy faces as the heels\nlast year, but uh pretty epic.\n&gt;&gt; That was her uh her big uh debut her she\nshe won the Hills last year and that was\nher a very big victory and kind of kind\nof announced her as that favorite\nstatus.\nmy elbow.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. For sure.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. We have Carla here trying to\ninterview the podium of today's stage.\n&gt;&gt; I'm back.\n&gt;&gt; Who was it?\n&gt;&gt; Cuz they already talking.\nGreat team or something.\n&gt;&gt; I'm surprised he let me leave that\nclimb. I was like, \"Oh, Rosa didn't\nfight me for this turn.\" I was like,\n\"Yes,\ngoing off.\" I was like, \"What?\"\n&gt;&gt; Oh, my feet are literally numb.\n&gt;&gt; Congratulations, Sophia, for the victory\nof stage one of Santa. How did you feel?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh, I mean, good enough to get the\nwin. Uh but no, we've been super busy\nthis week. We've had a team camp. We're\nkicking off uh 2026 with a massive\nexpansion of the off-road squad. So,\nit's been Yeah, we've been really busy,\nbut it's been super fun to kind of get\nthe whole team together and um yeah,\nkind of start talking about the year and\nyeah, I just I didn't mean to get away\non that climb and ride by myself cuz\nthat's like the thing I hate the most.\nSo, um it was a good mental mental\npractice day.\n&gt;&gt; Thank you so much. How was for you? H we\ncould see that you crashed that you\ncouldn't get the water bottle in the fit\nstation. Explain us a bit.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean um the race started off um\nquite nicely and I guess I think Sophia\nand me we got away on this first kind of\nkicker and then were later joined by\nMorgan. Um,\nI must say I don't love the mat and I\ncould see that Sophia was technically\nreally really really strong uh in the\nmat and then uh I send it down a little\nbit too hard and crashed quite bad so I\nhave to take care of that elbow soon but\nSophia was really uh strong so congrats\non a deserved victory. Um yeah, and then\nI guess um when we came to the long\ncentury climb um I went with Sophia and\nshe has a really good um you know upper\nthreshold power and then at [snorts] one\npoint I was just like okay um I'm not\nfeeling it today. So I uh took it like a\nnotch down and I think actually at that\npoint I kind of like was standing a bit\nbecause I think the gap catapult it out\nlike and I think at the end I got a bit\nof time back. Um but yeah, today I would\nsay uh the deserved when I was for sure\nSophia.\n&gt;&gt; Thank you [snorts] so much.\n&gt;&gt; How was for you?\n&gt;&gt; Well, it was uh pretty full gas from the\nbeginning. I didn't have the pleasure to\nride with these girls at the start. I\ndidn't quite have the legs. Um but I\nactually felt better and better as the\nrace went on. Um I was working with one\ngirl and we were doing pretty well\ntogether, but then I decided to attack\nand go solo. Um and then\n&gt;&gt; yeah, suddenly [snorts] found myself in\nthird position and just went full gas uh\nfor the final 20k. Um so yeah, I'm I'm\nreally really proud of this race and\nyeah, looking forward to tomorrow the\nsunshining. Um but it was very\ninteresting going through the river in\nmy road cleat. Uh so yeah um it gives\nyou motivation to stay on the bike when\nyou're in these road cleat cuz it's\ndifficult running in them. But um yeah\ngoing to go and recover now and somi for\ntomorrow. [laughter] Somi see you\n&gt;&gt; So hearing from them uh it's a tough\ndayh. Oh yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Sophia not liking going by herself then\ngoing by herself. Uh Rosa doesn't like\nthe mod and it's been a pretty muddy uh\nstage. So here in your screen you have\nthe top 10 woman\nnow. Sophia Gomez Dia [music] winning\nstage one followed by Rosa Closer third.\nSophie Wright, then Morgan Agira, then\nJerica [music] Shre, Axel Van Prebot,\nHane Vanlock, Nicole Fra, Lang, and\nKarolina Megon. So that's your\n&gt;&gt; I do wonder if there's a little bit of a\nglitch there in that uh we didn't see\nLissa Harttog in the top 10 and she was\nthere until the very end. So either\nshe's walking or her GPS chip did not uh\ntrack right there. So let's get some\nclarification on that. But right now, it\nlooks like we got some men's action.\nless than eight came to go. Eight K to\ngo for the men. Seven to go.\n&gt;&gt; They are coming into that little kicker\nand they are all still together. So, uh\nyou know, we don't know if I think moves\nhave been made or what's been happening,\n&gt;&gt; riders.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, there's no M. Oh, yeah. No, we're\nokay. All right. Um\nmaybe he was about to attack, but he\njust came right to the front there, huh?\n&gt;&gt; Okay. Oh.\n&gt;&gt; Ooh. Oh, okay. This is what I was\ntalking about. Coming off of the mud,\nright onto the pavement. It's always\nweird like that. Um.\n&gt;&gt; Oo. Yeah, this is a scary one. It's just\nbefore the river crossing.\n&gt;&gt; I [music] am glad Matt did not go into\nthe water there and just right under.\nIt's lucky he's the biggest guy in the\ngroup and he couldn't fit through those\nlittle monkey bars there. But, uh, yeah,\ncrashing on the pavement, too. I hope\nhe's all right. He might have a little\nroad rash. But um he went right back to\nthe front and just started riding and\njust showing that like that can't affect\nhim.\n&gt;&gt; So this is your front group on the men.\nUh Matt Beers, Matt Warts, W Aliman, and\nuh Roman Bett.\nSo we're going to have guys start\nthinking of how they're going to play\nthis again. Uh I think Roman is going to\nhave to try something on this climb. I\nmean, he's just got no option. And I\nmean, I don't think he wants to leave it\nto a sprint here, a four-up sprint with\nthese powerful riders. Um, and it's long\nenough. Just can he stay away? Um, or\ndoes he even have the legs?\nYou know, and the fact that Matt just\ncrashed, um, I'm sure the adrenaline's\nhigh right now. Um, he might have even\ngot an extra jolt of energy, uh, that\nwill probably last to the finish. But, I\nmean, gosh, it can't be feeling good\ngoing down on pavement like that.\nYeah, they've really close to the last\nkicker. I think remember that has to go,\nbut the rest of the riders know that\nthat's coming up and it's a pretty short\none.\n&gt;&gt; We just saw Rosa actually walk by our\nour media booth right here looking for a\nshower. She's trying to get that elbow\nall cleaned up. Uh she does not look\ncomfortable right now. So\n&gt;&gt; Oh, she looks in fame.\n&gt;&gt; Here's a very big men's group. That\nfight for fifth place is uh that's\nshaping up to be a very good battle\nhere. Um so this racing is going to be\ntight and there's all play for in the GC\ntomorrow. Looks like Matt is, you know,\nhe's dangling a little further. He's\nkind of rocking. I don't think Matt\nlooks looks too content right now. Um,\nstarting to come off the pace. Usually,\nyou know, when I've raced with him in\nthe past, like he will kind of straggle\noff the back and he can use his momentum\nto come back. Um, but right now, he just\nhe doesn't look good. I mean, his hips\nare rocking a bit. Uh,\n&gt;&gt; it's like he's not just coming back on\nthis is like a very flat smooth road.\nYeah, I think that fall had uh had to do\na bit with it. He's struggling a bit\nwith his body. You try to see him like\nyou see him, he's just trying to stretch\nand he's not comfortable on the bike at\nall.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. I don't know if he's nursing a bit\nof a cramp or maybe like a Charlie leg,\nyou know, a dead leg or something, but\nuh um you know that we still have that\nclimb to go. That kicker is just right\naround the bend here, isn't it?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. We're just going through the\nchicken farm that you could see on the\nleft and then uh they'll get the kicker\npretty soon.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. See, seeing this playing out, I\nthink uh we might have the fight for the\npodium.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. No, this is it. Um yeah, we never\nknow what uh maybe there's a surprise in\nthere somewhere. Maybe Matt's playing\nchicken and he like took a read a course\non uh on uh poker this this uh past off\nseason, but um the fact that he's just\nnot even getting on the wheel right now\njust makes me think he's just not\nfeeling great. Um\nyeah, so now it's going to be a very KY\nlittle battle.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, here he goes. Okay,\n&gt;&gt; he's\nit's a little choppy. Hoping for the\npicture to come through here. This is\nwhere it's all going down.\n&gt;&gt; Still there. Struggling a bit but not\nletting go.\n&gt;&gt; And mass is even coming back to the\n&gt;&gt; You know what the none of Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Not our prediction. No, they are fully\num they it's clear that they're just not\nconfident in knowing that uh one of them\ncould sprint long enough to get away\nfrom the others. I mean, it's if you did\nthat, it I guess it would be a\nthreeon-one. Um and they're not they\nthink they would just be burning matches\nfor the sprint. So, seems to me that\nthey've all resigned themselves to this\nbeing a a sprint final and hopefully\nsomeone's going to take a flyer here in\nthe last last few meters. Um, now we're\ngoing to see how Specialized is talked\nand uh, you know, looks like Matt is\nstarting to ride the front. Um, I wonder\nif Matt's just going to keep the pace\nhigh, um, to make sure that no one can\nget a jump and and it looks like Messor\nSchmidt is uh, positioning himself for\nuh, for the sprint.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's do a prediction.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, I don't know. This is so hard. I am\nnot a gambling man for a reason. Um,\nhere we go.\n&gt;&gt; So, now the one twos are starting.\n&gt;&gt; Good tactic from Matt's going to the\nfront. Less than 4 km ago. He's just\ngoing to try to stretch the group and\ntry to go.\n&gt;&gt; So, if Matt Beers has any It looks like\nthey're reacting pretty quickly and the\nspeed is so high. I think they're\nhopefully going to not hopefully, but it\nlooks like they're getting right back on\nhis wheel. Hopefully for the chaser that\nis. Um, and it looks like Matt doesn't\nhave it. He was that was his uh big pull\nin cell for for meware Schmidt there. So\num unfortunately that crash took\nsomething out of him because I would\nhave uh tried to if I were Matt Beers\nright there with the non-crash legs as\nsoon as they came back to mess with\nSchmidt that would have been Matt\nBeers's time to go. Um but unfortunately\nthat is uh that crash seems to have\naffected Matt.\nWell, Messor Schmidt is not giving up.\nHe's uh he's still got that just slight\ngap. So, those guys aren't getting a\nfull rest on him. Um he's all in.\n&gt;&gt; I know he's committed to get to the\nfinish line. We see a bit of a gap now.\nWe don't see the third person. It's just\n&gt;&gt; Oh, you see uh Dan Sot there waving his\narm. He's uh telling the moto camera to\nget away. Um he's feeling like uh maybe\nMatt Vers is getting a little bit of a\nbenefit from the draft there.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think Matt's uh leading and then\nit's Walt Alen.\n&gt;&gt; Uh maybe Roman. This is W here, huh?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is W.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so Roman Bard was the guy waving\nhis hands at the moto there. um in\nposition number two.\nW Alam is now just time traveling in for\nthird. Uh Roman doesn't look far though,\nso you never know what kind of cat-and-\nmouse games will cut if Roman gets back\non terms with with Mass.\n&gt;&gt; Less than 2 km to go to the finish line.\nThis is your top men on the screen.\n&gt;&gt; It looks like the elastic has finally\nsnapped and that's where Schmidt is\nekking out. uh racewinning gap with 2k\nto go. I mean, he's got to hold it for\nanother uh another three minutes at this\npace. But, uh\nyeah, by the end, this has not been a\nclean day by any means. Now, we've seen\ncrashes in the very front of the podium.\nSo, I can't wait to hear what the\ncarnage was behind today.\n&gt;&gt; There's going to be a lot of stories.\nWe'll get them to you tomorrow once we\nget the know uh a lot of people to talk\nto today. But here on your screen, uh\nless than two kilome to go, we have uh\nMattwoods uh leading the men on the\nback, Roman Bardett, and we have here\nWalt Alman from the Booth BH team\nfighting for third position.\n&gt;&gt; So that's your podium. uh position\ntentatively and it's all just a game of\nseconds still for tomorrow though. So\nthe men's race is completely open\nand this is where team tactics team\ntactics will again start to Okay. And\nnow we have W Alaman get reconnecting\nwith Roman Barde.\nSo Roman blew up trying to get on terms\nwith me Schmidt and couldn't quite hang.\npound\n&gt;&gt; and I do think if this comes to a sprint\nbetween them, what is going to get the\nsecond position?\n&gt;&gt; And this was always mess preferred\nterrain here, you know, he was I think\nhe was the Danish time trial champion\nfor the elites for quite a few years and\nuh won some stages from a breakaway in\nthe Jiro and stuff. So, uh Roman being a\nmountain specialist, um you know, this\nwas where Matt made his move and was\nable to tuck down, get in that arrow\ncrouch, keep the speed.\nSo here is Matt just in the final\nkilometer. We can see him almost\nreaching the finish line. So he's going\nto be the winner of the first stage of\nSanta Bal 2026.\nHere you have it. Mattwards from\noff-road specialized team\n&gt;&gt; European champion.\n&gt;&gt; Enough time to post up. No, no one in\nthe background behind him there.\nAnd that was an impressive ride to come\nback from that. Remember in the first\nhour of the race he crashed\nin four position. Another specialized\nwhole group of women there coming in at\nthe same time.\n&gt;&gt; We'll see Roman here. W Alaman. We need\nto see the finish. Uh\n&gt;&gt; Roman is not happy here. He's yelling to\nsay bring the organizer to me. It sounds\nlike he's going to file a complaint\nabout something in the final there. Um,\nbut at the end of the day, I don't know\nwhat's going to happen. I mean, there's\nalways this is always a discussion in\nevery sort of racing. I mean, it's an\nunfortunate side of racing, but um, this\nalso happened in uh, Unbound last year\nis, you know, we're trying to bring the\ncoverage to the viewer. Um, and it's\nhard to bring the coverage and at the\nsame time give the riders enough space.\nUh, especially the way that riders\naccelerate in gravel sections with the\nspeed of motos and the the way that the\nthe bikes handle differently. Um, I\ncan't really fault Matt Schmidt for um,\nusing everything at his advantage. It's\nkind of just an unknown code in pro\nracing that, you know, you have to if\nthe moto's there, you take advantage of\nit. Um, it's not your fault. It's almost\nmore the Moto's fault, but at the end of\nthe day, like I I can't fault Mess for\ndoing that, even though that that could\nbe how Roman feels as a difference\nmaker.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's always hard to control\neverything that's happening around. But\nuh for now, we have uh Matt SWS in first\nposition of Santal, second for Wood\nAlaman, and then third for Roman Bard.\n&gt;&gt; You know, I would still say that Mess is\nthe very worthy winner again how he came\nback from that crash. And remember, he\nwas alone chasing and had that big time\ntrial by himself for the better part of\nan hour. I think he was from basically\n25% of the course to 50% of the course.\nHe was by himself. So, I mean, Mess had\na hell of a ride today.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, he has to be happy with his ride.\nWe saw him smiling. Uh, that is hard to\nget from him. A smile at the end of a\nstage race. Uh he has more to come\ntomorrow and it's going to be another\nbig fight. But today,\n&gt;&gt; what a day. What an epic ride from\neverybody.\n&gt;&gt; This is the chasing rope of the men. Big\ngroup came together, huh?\n&gt;&gt; Good names here. That's where the that's\nbeen riding. They've gotten a bit of the\nwoman pelaton as well. So now here we\nsee a bit of a mix and we're going to\nhave them in the finish line pretty\nsoon.\nstage\nin the water.\nSophia tomorrow\nmust defend a crown.\nIt's good to meet\nHeat. Heat.\nOkay, here you have the chasing group\nalmost on the finish line.\n&gt;&gt; Big spring from this group. You saw the\nleft corner and uh\nHugo Du there. Kaiser Dan Saut\nStanby\nAman Stanby, right? Um\nthat's a very big group.\n&gt;&gt; Full pelonh\nboth.\nBen Thomas, Mati Marking, this group.\n&gt;&gt; Yep. Big group right at four minutes\nback. So, um yeah, that's a that means\nit's all all to play for tomorrow in my\nmind. I mean, even though uh you know,\nMatia Deari is sitting in 26th place. I\nmean, he's just a handful of seconds\noutside the top 10 potentially. So,\n&gt;&gt; and it's a good stage for him tomorrow.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly. So, for sure he'll play around.\nSo many things happening today. Uh great\nuh way to start the season. It's been an\nepic ride. We've had uh interviews from\nthe women. We'll get some interviews\nfrom the men. We know there's a bit of\ncomplaints from remember that to see uh\nwhat happened in the finish line, but\n[music] it's when um things are this\nclose, we're always\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a hard call. I [music] mean,\nI don't know how he would change it\nover. I don't think they can uh\ndisqualify a penal masmid [music]\nfor that. I mean, I feel for everybody\nhere. You don't want the motor to ever\naffect the race, but at the same time, I\ndon't know\nhow you would correct it. [music] You\ncan't go back. It's again, it's not\nMess's fault. Um,\n&gt;&gt; I mean, we will see. We'll talk to them\nhere in the screen. You have your\n[music] top 20 men for the first stage\nof Santaval.\n12 kilometers, more than 1,600 m of\nelevation. They had puddles, they had\nclimbs, [music] they had rocks, they had\nEpic day. Now we'll go with the\ninterview with the men to see what they\nhave to say.\nTwo to six\nmarkov rights\nor eight is\nCNC.\n&gt;&gt; Congratulations for the victory of the\nstage one of Santa. Can you explain us a\nbit how was the race for you?\n&gt;&gt; Uh it was it was very tricky. Uh I made\na wrong decision on on my tires. So, I\ndidn't have any grip in in all the mud\nand it was a good start and then and I\nwas in in the front with Matt, my\nteammate. Um, but then we had these I\ndon't know how long it was with full of\nmud and uh and I I couldn't handle my\nbike. I I lost I think a minute and a\nhalf or something to the guys. Um I was\nrolling around there and had had to run\nand uh yeah, it was a it was a bit of a\n[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] show for me.\nThen uh then then I start the long climb\nand then I just find a good rhythm and\nand in the end I I catch the guys and\nthen uh from there we start to race for\nthe for the victory.\nSo we heard from the interview from\nMatt's uh yeah it looked like that way\nlike he couldn't like really ride and he\nsaid\nso now we'll go with W Alamon to see\nsecond\n&gt;&gt; at today's stage.\n&gt;&gt; Hello. Hello. How was the race for you\ntoday?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, super good. Uh like the start it\nwas quite hard with all these uh all the\nguys and like it was really fast but\nthen on Elanos climb I felt really good.\nUm but it was just too far from the\nfinish and in the like in the flat parts\nI suffered a bit in the end and I think\nI can be super happy with second m was\nwas just uh like stronger today and I\nthink this was the like the best\npossible result for today.\n&gt;&gt; Okay. Thank you so much and see you\n&gt;&gt; So here you have it. Words from the\nwinner and the runner up. So your stage\nwinner Matt Sports uh look uh seem\npretty happy. Bad decisions on tire\nchoice. Maybe he'll change them\ntomorrow. Waltz didn't uh enjoy the flat\nparts, but he came back to uh second\nposition and then Roman Barrett\nthird uh on the stage today. What a day.\nWhat an epic condition. Tomorrow we have\nalmost 90 kilometers of a bit more ups\nand downs, a bit more rocky terrain.\njust started with a climb single track.\nI think a bit more technical, tactical,\nuh shorter race and uh a lot things to\nhappen.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think there's going to be a lot\nof people uh I think only two riders are\ntruly content and that's the the\nspecialized duo up front there. Um\neveryone else has a is it's a grudge\nmatch now and they're gonna they're\ngoing to want to prove something. No one\nwants to leave empty-handed. So, it's\ngoing to be some fireworks tomorrow.\nThanks for joining us today. We're here\nin Sangraori. More tomorrow and thank\nyou very much. Adios. Ciao.\nHeat.\nWelcome to a new season.\nWelcome to Gravel Earth series.\nHeat. Hey, Heat."

      "transcript": "It's something you cannot really prepare\nyourself for and remind yourself that\nthis does end. There is a finish line.\nThere are always like moments that you\nfeel super strong, but there are moments\nthat you feel like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and you really\nquestion your life choices.\nDemons in your mind and you have to like\nfight them. It was really over the\nlimit. Really wanted to be fighting for\nthat podium. Yeah, I'm confident that I\nhave done everything I can and now it's\njust trying to get it all. The course\nwill decide a worthy winner. And I hope\nit's me. But even if it's not me, the\nwinner will be a true winner. For the\nnew king of\nfor like shifts colors. It goes from\nlike rust to Yeah, it looks good. This\nis the Tianda Delwain.\nThe nicest the nicest shop he's had yet.\nUh so Wayne is building a brand new bike\nuh two days before the race and that's\nbecause the airline uh decided\nto apparently stomp on my bike with a\nservice car or something, but it was\nopened it up uh on Tuesday night at\n10:00 p.m. and it was obliterated. Uh\none of the worst frame brakes I've ever\nseen in my life. And you know, anyone\ncan pack a bike as well as they can, but\nuh it won't help something like that. If\nsomething was going to happen, it was\nnice that it was a in Jirona, which is\nthe center of the cycling world, and b\nCanyon was here. So, um you know, if\nthis happened at any other race, I\nprobably wouldn't be starting.\nSo, I mean, for me, the days before a\nrace is super nervous. I try to control\nmy feelings. Uh I was speaking with my\nphysiootherapist and he told me Clara\nwait with the stress until 2 minutes\nbefore the start because all the stress\nwe have leading up is just waste of\nenergy and in the end we don't want to\nwaste energy. So I try to keep calm,\nenjoy life in Jona these days is\namazing. So much going on but also take\nit chill.\nThat's a really good question because\nI've actually today been through like\nmany emotions like of being very excited\nof like I don't know if I can do it and\num and everything in between. So I think\nthe days leading up the race to the\nraces are pretty hard uh because you\nbasically put all the work in already\nbefore and then it's the days leading up\nto the race are mostly resting um doing\nsome sponsor events um then everyone is\ncoming into town so you're busy with\nthat and um yeah I think once I'm\ntomorrow on the start line I'm actually\nhappy the start is there. Yeah.\nThis is your first time on this wheel.\nYeah, first time. Yeah. Yeah.\nIt's uh It's wide. Yeah. It looks so\nweird without a tire on cuz you're just\nlike, are you sure?\nYou're not worried about changing the\nsetup? No. Oh, no. I think Yeah.\nThink it's going to be for the better.\n[Music]\nHe's in it to win it this year. I almost\nretired after the 360 last year because\nI knew that it was the most beautiful\nwin of my career and that uh stories\nlike this don't happen in cycling. It\nwas a fairy tale. The most unique day of\nracing I've ever had. Um personally at\nthe start line, no one knows this is\nprobably the craziest thing. Um my\nclassified hour shift um died at the\nstart. So, I actually raced the entirety\nof track of last year in a 50 front\nchain ring. I had a puncture, maybe 70k\nin or something like this. I lost so\nmuch time in these races. It's like, you\ndon't make that back. But, uh I remember\ntexting my wife and um everybody who was\nfeeding me and saying like, you know, I\nflatted [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'm out of the race. Like,\nI'm going to finish, but I don't know.\nMy tire's pretty blown. I lost 8 minutes\nbefore the first aid station. I was 8\nminutes behind the group. Um, and I come\ninto the first aid and luckily Rob\nBritain was there too with his own\npunctures from a different moment. I\njust said to Rob, like we came all the\nway from North America, like we're not\ngoing to drop out and go home. Like we\nstill ride as hard as we can because\nwe're here. The two of us like\nessentially for the next 8 hours just\nrallied like crazy. And I didn't have a\npower meter on a day and my heart rate\nmonitor died that morning. So I had like\nI have no data from that day. like the\ncraziest day I've ever had racing a\nbike. Like so I have no idea what I did.\nI was just out there riding hard and I\nremember we catch guys and just ride\nthrough them and we did that for 8 hours\nstraight. We call it collecting bodies,\nright? You see a dead body coming and\nyou take it and then you throw it. Um\nand all of a sudden before the second\naid station, we saw the front group and\nwe started laughing like it was, oh my\ngosh, we're in the front. The best\ndefense is a good offense. So I just\nrode as hard as I possibly could of up\nit and we rode everybody except Pete,\nMati and myself off the off the wheel\nand I just absolutely detonated on like\nhow maybe like 2K to go over the top\nlike I was seeing stars. Uh Matia went\nand then Matia had the worst luck of his\ncareer and his his bike broke. I heard\nsome like clanging behind me and Pete\ncomes up. He's like, \"Matia's derailer's\ngone. It's just you and me.\"\nthe win only seemed important after the\nrace.\nUm, we both had the feeling, I think,\nthat it was the journey and that the way\nthat this race happened was the most\nspecial moment. To make it even more\nspecial, this was the first time I had\nreturned to Jirona since I left the\nWorld Tour in 2019. My only like friends\nfrom Catalunia that we still keep in\ncontact with, they were my aid station.\nSo it was really to finish and like all\nof a sudden we won was with your family\nand your friends instead of a big\ncompany. It was the most special moment.\nSo\nI've only I only saw a few bits of the\ncourse, but I rode the last 30 miles or\nso and it brought total like Oregon\ntrail rides just like adventure, not\njust like straight farm roads like. So,\nI'm just excited for mixing up and and\nchecking this whole area out and stoked\nto be here. So, if you're out there and\nyou're doing the 200, you better sign up\nfor this next year. Cowards,\nI think I looked at the start list for\nthe 200 and I think we're around 70 pro\nelite women. I think that's great.\nThat's a great field. And yeah, so I\nthink it will for sure be exciting and I\nthink no one will uh will get the crown\nwithout the fight.\nI'm Sarah Sturm and I race for\nSpecialized Stram Rafa and I'm from the\nUnited States.\nOh, I need food so bad.\nI think I might be done with the truck.\nI love it. I knew you were going to say\nthat. Yeah, I came\nback. I just I've gotten second. I've\ngotten third. It's a great race. I have\nto try again.\nin this room like around 4 kilo in 10\npeople drunk all the time. Yeah, maybe\nthe day before, the night before I'm\nstart like a little bit nervous, but\nyeah, maybe it's normal. My key maybe\nthe day before is like stay with my my\nenough team and my friend and chill\nride, stay all the people, maybe take\nsome uh uh time for me. Yeah, I try to\nnot stay really focused to the race. But\nfor sure after the dinner, I need to\nlike prepare the the bottles, the P zone\nand everything. And in this part maybe\nlike okay, I'm yeah, tomorrow is like\n360k and I don't work in the industry. I\nride my bike all the here and I don't\nthink like today is like a tough day.\nIt's a pleasure.\nUsually I'm just like, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] this is\nearly. That's a lot of the time all I'm\nthinking about. And then you kind of get\nnervous and it's just like it's you just\nhave to switch on. I remember that was\nmy first big race in gravel.\nUm I was it was nice because no one knew\nme so there are no expectations compared\nto this year. So it was really nice just\nto just go and have a long day uh on a\nbike. Um it's just so much energy. You\nknow we have a long trip to get here and\nyou just want to get the first pedal\nstroke. Once the start goes you're\nyou're racing. So it's that's like\nalmost the best moment of the whole day\nbecause all of the you know prior\nobligations that you had leading up to\nthe race day prior days you're running\naround you're kind of stressed out and\nthen once this the race starts it's the\nonly thing you have to focus on is\nracing. It's going to be a long day and\na lot of things can happen. So you're\njust thinking the pain you're going to\ngo through and hoping that everything\ngoes your way and nothing happens. So,\nit's Yeah, it's just demons in your mind\nand you have to like fight them. Three,\ntwo, one, let's\ngo in the men's field. Wow, the depth of\nthe field was so strong. It was just\nattack after attack. We saw attack after\nattack. We We saw a bit of a group\ntrying to go on the uphill. They got a\nbit of time, but then on the flap, the\nwhole group got together. It was more\nthan 25 riders. One of the hardest races\nI do all season. It's uh one of the most\num demanding courses where you really\nhave to be a versatile rider with a lot\nof know different abilities if if you\nwant to perform well. Yeah, the women's\nrace, it was the first time that they\nhad a pure pure race. No drafting\nallowed, their own start, 10 minutes\nbehind the men. So, the group just\nstarted a bit slow. They were watching\neach other and then at some point they\nthe big guns just started\npushing. So, just after the first eight\nstation. Yeah, it was a bit douchy.\nEverybody's trying to change their water\nand rushing because this is a key moment\non the race. It's the first big climb.\nYou know, everybody's going to try to\npush a bit to test each other. So, the\ngroup started to get a bit nervous and\nuh we saw Luis Valentine hit a rock,\njust did like a tumble, and then G was\njust behind her wheel. Oh, no. Is that\nG? Yeah. G just went to the ground. Oh,\nshe's back up. She's back up. Oh, whoa,\nwhoa. Oh. Oh, come on. Gee, something\nhappened. No, no, no, no, no, no.\nOh no. Seen it live. She was riding in\nthe pelaton on the front.\nOh no. This is something you don't want\nto see. I raced for another 135 km with\na with a broken radius. Um I didn't know\nthat at the time, but I was so\ndetermined that I wanted to continue\nbecause so many things can happen and I\nknew there's a chance you can still win\neven if you had a bad crash. But\nunfortunately, it wasn't my day. After\n275 kilometers, I uh I gave up because I\nhardly could handle the the bike\nanymore. I couldn't hold my handlebar\nand I thought it's not safe with the\ndownhill coming up after the big climb.\nMaybe I would want to All\nright, go get there.\nperformance. forch.\nperformance. Nobody\nYeah, when Tobias escaped uh on the\nstream and we're thinking what he is he\ndoing like this is pretty brave move.\nIt's still a long way and then you have\nthe climb but then you have a lot of\nflat after the first feat to only around\n130. We luckily the the group got a lot\nsmaller. Then we hit the climbs and uh I\nthink some of the the smaller guys they\nuh they climb a little bit better than\nme. So, I was struggling a lot out\nthere, but I just managed to survive it.\nAnd then let me hit the flat part uh\nafter 180. I knew there would be 100 km\nof pure flat riding and that's what I'm\ngood at. So, I\nthought instead of letting all the the\nsmaller guys benefit from uh from me,\nthe flat part, I thought, okay, I go and\nthen they need to spend some energy\nchasing me down. Nobody thought that was\ngoing to go to the end. They knew the\nkey point was going to be El's matches\nand that's what happened on the rest of\nthe field. We just saw riders like\npopping out of the of the pelaton till\nit was just stemen and uh stocky\nwondering if this was a genius uh the\nmost stupid thing I've ever done. Uh\nbecause I had a few hours out there to\nthink. But I knew with with me being a\nlittle bit more heavy, I can also do\nsome okay numbers on the flat parts\nwhere some of the smaller guys if the\ngroup is not working super well, they\nthey will lose a lot of uh time all all\nthe time. So I knew if I just keep on\npushing in a good position, they also\nneed to spend some energy chasing me\ndown. And but the king of track this\nyear was the\nlead. In this moment, we was not sure\nand it was still a long way and yeah, he\nmanaged to finish this and it's amazing\nwhat he did. Yeah.\nShe didn't had the results she expected\non the beginning of the season, but now\nwe know the reason. She wanted this\nrace. She wanted to become the queen of\ntracker again, and she got it.\nT is one of the reasons why pass racing\nis exist and therefore it means a lot\nfor for us to be able to to show the\nteam colors and win in a race like\nT and yeah really impressed about car\nbecause Mont is yeah second example for\nme because I I I like challenges. I love\ncycling and I think anyway like 360k uh\nyou wouldn't do it without an event also\nwith amateurs that they do it and they\nfinish at night. That's just as crazy\nfor me. So uh I think I really admire\nevery person who finish the race.\nUm so I do it because I just love\ncycling and riding my\nbike. I think it's like trackus. It's\nkind of like the true test I think of\ngravel. Um, like it tests everything and\nthat's why I think it's such a cool\nrace. Like you have to be good on the\nflat, but you have to be good at\ndescending and you have to be good at\nclimbing and it's it's like one of those\nraces that just it tests everything. 360\nrace is more for pure gravelers. It's\nthe people that they just have gravel in\ntheir heart. But the distance, the 200\ndistance, just by the athlete\npresentation, we had to have 15 top\nriders and we had such a hard time just\npicking them. There are less American\nriders here for sure, but there are more\nriders from the other disciplines.\nIncredible strong like mountain bike\nfield. Probably some some roadies as\nwell. Uh and I think this is also like a\nrace that uh suits really well actually\nthe mountain bikers and it's unlike\nunbound where it's very specific and you\nkind of need to have like experience\nlike we saw with Maharidge last year. So\nalso like Jura is a training place for\nfor a lot of people. So kind of here\neverybody's is well prepared no matter\nthe discipline that he he does. So I\nthink this this might be the most uh\nmost tech field of of the whole year\nactually.\nAs athletes, we know that suffering is\ngoing to happen. And I think embracing\nit and knowing that, you know, that\nfirst climb is going to hurt a lot and\nthe second climb is going to hurt a lot\nand being ready for it.\nToday the race was really chaotic. Go\nwas more like a road race. Really\ntactical. So many attacks. So nothing. I\nwas just there waiting waiting waiting\nfor the long climb where many riders\nspent I think too much energies before.\nI mean, last year I was second place\nhere at the race and I think that's\nautomatically put some pressure on you,\nbut it was a very beautiful second place\nAnd I'm super proud of that. Uh this\nyear I'm not sure I can do it again. I\nwas unlucky. Had a crash this winter. Uh\nso my first races this year has has not\nbeen as good as I hoped for. Um but I\nthink I still keep dreaming. I have many\nyears to grow is what I start to realize\nand I think this is just the beginning\nof a career and it goes up and down for\nfor all athletes.\n[Applause]\nYeah, the tactics came to play. We saw a\nbit of the riders having teammates and\nuh yeah, the the the group just broke\nand our first group, that's what we\nexpected, the stronger riders to be\nthere. By the push of it, uh Sophia and\nRosa at some point got a bit of time on\nAnakah and they started pushing. But\nyeah, of course Sophia wasn't going to\npush because Ana is her her teammate.\nFor Rosa closer has to be super super\nstrange and hard because she just\npushed. It had to be super frustrating\nto have Sophia in your wheel, but\nknowing you wouldn't get any release\nbecause you had her teammate on the\nback. So yeah, it's just like I cannot\nimagine what she was thinking. She was\nlike, \"Okay, I just won this. I just won\nthis.\" She got third on track last year,\nsecond this year, and yeah, even Sophia\nsaid that she's so strong and she'll get\nthe win. And I think yeah, she's such a\nstrong rider and she deserves a win that\nshe will get pretty soon.\nYou were descending like a maniac as\nwell.\nLost two bottles. If you didn't give me\nthe eight step, I think I would have\nfallen off the bike. But you know what?\nYou were so amazing at telling me when\nto turn and pulling things out. Yeah,\nI'm I'm actually really proud of my\nperformance. I think I had really good\nlegs. Um, now it's up to being maybe\neven better strategically. Join next\ndeal.\nUh the competition is super hard and the\nlevel is high. Uh it was my goal. I'm\njust extremely happy that, you know,\nI've been working hard the last two\nmonths only for this and and it's been a\nbig process and I'm just happy it pays\noff. Fast racing team, oh my god, going\nto what can I tell you? I think they\nhave their year. They've done what they\ncame to do. They're sponsors of this\nrace. You could see them everywhere. And\nKing of Queen of Traa 360, King of\nTracka 200. I think they have it all.\nJust hats off. Whatever you want. You've\ndone an incredible job and you had you\nhave to be proud. It's just a team that\nah to top off this it's just going to be\nsuper hard. Make noise for the new king\nof the city. For the new king of Korea.\nThat's okay. See first race. What the\nhell man? I mean, I risked it, but tried\nit was too long. I can come with a\nmillion excuses, but that's not what\npeople want to hear anyway. I know when\nI'm back in game, I think it will be\nvery clear."

      "transcript": "Heat. Heat.\n[Music]\nWe're in beautiful Emporia, Kansas,\nwhere thousands of riders mark their\ncalendar each year for the opportunity\nto take on miles and miles of the\ngorgeous Flint Hills.\n[Applause]\nThe North Course is punchier and\nchunkier. It's a beast. It's I mean\nchunky like the gravel. It's just like\nthese massive rocks. This event takes\nrespect and it takes significant\npreparation.\nIt's one of the most unpredictable races\nbecause of flat tires and mechanicals\nthat can happen to equipment.\nIt's just a beatdown. Like, I don't care\nhow hard you train. I don't care how\ngnarly of terrain you ride on on a\nregular basis. To race 200 miles on this\nterrain is just so destructive.\nHigh speeds, more chaos in the field.\nEveryone's just up in the game. Like,\nit's just one little notch after one\nlittle notch.\nThe competition level is through the\nroof. I think this is probably the most\ncompetitive field we've ever\nhad. A result at Unbound means a lot\nbecause it's a race that people around\nthe world have heard\nof. Unbound started in the parking lot\non the northwest side of town with 36\nriders. Um, and most of them were from\njust around the region. It was not a big\nnational event.\nIt's changed a lot. Obviously, starting\nin 2006 with uh no GPS and just Q\nsheets. In the early days, it was a\nlittle bit more choose your own\nadventure, if you\nwill. 20 years ago, Emporia was not a\ncycling town. There were a dozen of us\nthat rode bikes. Now, there are hundreds\nof the 4,000 people lining up to take on\nUnbound. 10% of them come from within a\n20m radius of Emporia, Kansas. It has\ncompletely transformed the identity of\nwho we are right here in Emporia.\nLifetime coming on board with us in 2019\nwas a big game changer. Um, Lifetime\ndefinitely believes in building\ncommunity and healthy way of life.\nThere's a history before lifetime at\nUnbound Gravel and there's a history in\nEmporia, Kansas before Unbound Gravel.\nAnd it's our job to preserve the ethos\nof the event and to ensure that when\npeople leave Emporia, Kansas, they know\nwhat the Flint Hills is, who the people\nthat live here are, what they do. But\nit's this community that makes Unbound\nGravel so special.\nThere are rocks flying everywhere. There\nare crashes happening. It is really hard\nto focus for 10 and 1/2 hours. Perfect\nworld scenarios don't exist in Unbound.\nI don't know if anyone has ever finished\nUnbound and not just had everything\nhurting. It just beats up your entire\nbody.\nIt's such a race of attrition. You're\ngoing to feel it so bad. Just brutal all\nthe way around.\nUnbound is the champagne of gravel. baby\nis the biggest gravel event in the world\nfrom what I hear and I'm new to racing\nand I thought there's a lot I can learn\nout here um not just from the course but\nfrom the people that are involved. I\nrode 300k a couple of weeks ago um on\nthe road and that was all right. Um but\nthis has got a bit more climbing than I\nhad in that and uh I've never ridden\nthat far before so it's not far outside\nbut it's enough to be intimidating a\nlittle bit. My son is actually in one of\nthe races. So, we decided to come down\nhere and watch him and make ourselves\nuseful. Just means the spirit of gravel\nand just like it's like there's no\nlimits. You're going to be maxed out.\nIt's going to be a mental challenge.\nIt's going to be a physical challenge\nand you're out in the middle of nowhere\nand it's just you, your bike, and you\nknow, whatever you can put together\nmentally on the day. You know, whatever\ncomes out of the wash is going to come\nout. you're going to have a real winner.\nMan, this is my first time here and so\nfar the atmosphere uh people uh is\nsomething else is amazing. Amazing.\nAmazing. Definitely they will this will\nbe in my calendar every year.\nUh we're going to do the Unbound Gravel\n2025. You know, it's we're coming up on\nuh what is it like 4:30 now. Um we're in\na pretty good place with the setup. Um\nyou know, nothing's left now but the\nriders. You know, we're just waiting on\nthem to get here and get this thing\ngoing. A little bit about our course map\nout there today. We've got I want to\nwalk everyone through what our riders\nare going to be facing. those first 25\nodd miles heading north out of town.\nKind of a gentle start to the day,\nletting all our riders know what they\nare in\nfor. Doesn't come until about mile 26 or\nso, but that's going to be the first\nreal section of the race that everyone\nconsiders. That's C Reserve Road. The\nfirst section of pretty challenging\ngravel up that way. From there, it's on\nto Escridge, which of course is the\nfirst neutral water stop of the day.\nJust beyond Escridge, of course, the\ninfamous Divide Road section. Another\nchallenging spot. Then it's on to Alma\nin the first of two checkpoints out on\nthe course. After that, Little Egypt is\nalways one of the toughest sections of\nthe course. That's going to come right\naround 104 miles. From there, we'll head\ntowards Council or Alta Vista, rather,\nwhere they'll continue to head\nsouthbound. And Council Grove then will\nbe the second feed zone out on the\ncourse where they have an opportunity to\nconnect with their staff for the final\ntime of the day. Just south of Council\nGrove, the course starts to head a\nlittle bit more eastbound and at roughly\n75 miles. That's when they start to hit\nthe Lake Cahola area. Twostep climb wide\nopen. One of the last big challenges\nthat they face before they start to make\ntheir way back into town after Lake\nKahola gets a little bit rolling. No big\nsignificant clines or significant gravel\nsectors on the way back into town, but\nwind is the story of the day at that\npoint. Crosswinds and tailwinds will be\npushing the riders all the way back into\ntown. Highland Hill by the university,\nthe final hard section before finishing\nright back here on Commercial Street.\nThis year at Unbound Gravel presented by\nShimano, we have the biggest field that\nwe've ever had in its 19-year history.\nOver 5,000 athletes racing across all\nthe distances. It's going to be the\nbiggest day we've seen yet here in\nEmporia. And it's also stop number two\non the 2025 Lifetime Grand Prix.\nYeah, I'm ready. Yeah. Now I'm just\nexcited.\nWhat's the plan for today? Oh, trying to\nsurvive.\nYeah. No, no plans. Yeah, just trying to\nenjoy it. It's birthday. Don't forget.\nAbsolutely. I'll wish him a happy\nbirthday out there. Right.\nCurrently sitting second overall. He's\nthe champion of South Africa. Welcome\nMatt Beers,\nyour current overall leader of the\nLifetime Grand Prix. Welcome Mr. Keegan\nSwenson. Yeah.\nAnd in 3 2 1\nWell, this year we've got more\ninternational competition than ever.\nIt's been great to see almost 50% of our\nriders in attendance for our Pro Men's\nLifetime Grand Prix event coming from\noverseas. Again, that first 25 or so\nmiles relatively tame in terms of the\nFlint Hills gravel that the riders see,\nbut always a very fast pace as they make\ntheir way towards call reserve road. And\nthat opening pace that was upwards of\nabout 24 25 m an hour. And what we saw\nhappen was uh we saw a big group pacing\nkind of coming out of the uh of the\nstart there. We saw some riders with a\nlittle mishap early, but the big talk\nwas we saw a big group of roughly 15\nriders separating very\nearly. Looks like that group includes\nCam Jones, Simone Pel, Toby Reed, and\nMazwartz Schmidt. Well, if this group\nstays out in front, it could make for\nsome very interesting moves later on in\nthe race. Well, as always, one of the\nnotables in our men's field is Alexi\nVarmmulan. We caught up with Alexi\nbefore the race. Um,\nokay. The goal of today is kind of\ntwofold. One, want to be ready for rule\nof three. I want to make sure don't get\ninjured, nothing stupid happens, and\nalso can can race effectively. Got a\nlittle 55 mile ride. Um, I'm Alex McMan.\nI race bikes professionally and I'm\nprobably most well known for riding with\nmy little dog, Willie. So, racing gravel\nprofessionally in the US has changed\nquite a bit from what I grew up doing on\nthe road.\ngone from very focused racing on winning\nand that being the only focus of the day\nto the minute you're off the bike you\nhave so many other jobs. Yeah, we are\nstill answering your questions from last\ntime. Um there's always been this dream\nto create things that inspire people but\nalso educate along the way. We kind of\nhad this idea about 3 years ago about\nhow why don't we do a YouTube channel,\nlittle vlog style here, a little race\nreport there. But I was very excited by\nthis idea that you could reach people\nwho weren't at the race. And so how do\nyou give them something to interact and\nbe involved with or motivate them to\ncome the next year? It's through\ncontent.\nIt's just I really enjoy talking to\npeople. I enjoy being around the expo. I\nenjoy creating content. It's not\nstressful to me. See a lot of guys kind\nof wrapping their bars further. I think\nit's just being honest with yourself,\nknowing that, okay, I have this amount\nof time and this amount of hours to do\nthings and I need to build this week out\nso that I can be the best athlete I can\nat the end of the week. Um, while doing\nas many of these uh off the bike\nendeavors that I've been asked to\ndo going into this year, the Grand Prix\nis my entire focus. Doing other races\naround it, but they're all a chance to\nprepare for the Grand\nPrix. I think the first couple years of\nthe Grand Prix, I was just trying to\nfigure it out, see what I wanted to do.\nIt worked out. I was lucky sometimes.\nThis year, I want to put some pressure\non myself. I want to try to win it. Want\nto take down the King Keegan. Racing to\nwin is different. This also means racing\nto possibly\nlose. A lot of these races, there's so\nmany great guys now that you can't win\nby just sitting there and hoping that\nyou're the best at the finish line cuz\nit's not going to\nwork. I'd love to be going to Unbound to\nHad Keegan, but I'm not. To me, when I\nstarted this year, tactically, I said,\n\"No questions asked. I have to beat\nKeegan at Seotter or Unbound.\" That's\nthe mindset. I don't need to win the\nrace. I have to beat Keegan.\nUnbound to me is mentally tough. It is\nreally hard to focus for 10 and a half\nhours and not make a mistake. And I'm\ntalking about not hitting a rock, not\ntaking a corner wrong, not overlapping a\nwheel, getting all your food, being able\nto eat all your food. It's It's never\nending. It's a lot about luck, but it's\nat the end of the day, it's a lot about\nhow mentally resilient are you because\nsomething's going to go wrong. How do\nyou solve\nit? I think I'm most excited to just go\nout there and race. I know I'm fit. Um I\nthink always the first race of the year\nis nerve-wracking, but once you kind of\nset a pecking order, um it's just about\ngetting down to business and racing a\nbike like you know you can.\nWell, let's see if Alexi has it in the\nlegs today. Hey, what do you guys think?\nAre you ready to send our women out\nthere on courts? Ladies and gentlemen,\nLifetime Grand Prix. Welcome Sophia\nGomez\nVisha to Vamporia. Please welcome back\nPaige Onweller.\nLet's try this one more time. Hey\nEmporia, are you ready?\nAll right, now you all warmed up and\nready to go here today. Our women are\ngoing to bring in the heat out here on\ncourse. We are going to go at 6:05. So\nriders, we will give you a little count\nand and Porter, you're going to make\nnoise one more time in three, two, one.\nWe are under.\nAnd our women's race is underway. It's a\nstacked field here today and looks to be\nan exciting race. Five minutes after\nsix, so 15minute gap once again just\nlike we did last year. Oh man, what I'm\nso excited for today's race. The women\nput on a show last year. I expect the\nsame thing from them today. And as the\nwomen roll off the line, you know, and\nthen you can feel those nerves and they\ngot off to a great start and we're just\nwaiting to see what happens today at the\nfinish line. Yeah, it was a great start\nfor the women and lots going on in that\nfirst part of the women's race. We know\nthere was a couple of crashes early on.\nIt looked like nobody got really\ninjured. Most of the riders uh save one\nI think got back in the mix. Here we see\nthe crash. Uh as as you said there, we\nbelieve there was one rider who wasn't\nable to get going. Emily Newsome was one\nof the riders down who was I think the\nlast rider to get back on her bike, but\nshe did catch back up to the group. So,\nshe's now in the in the big chase again.\nI think maybe to get a little more\ninformation, we've got our friend Lauren\nHall out there following along at the\nfront of the women's race. So, we should\nprobably move on over to Lauren. And\nLauren, what is going on up there at the\nfront? We are only a couple of miles\ninto the race, guys, and we've already\nhad a touch of\nwheels, a small\ncrash. The anticipation of today has\nbeen\nso intense trying to figure out tire\nchoices leading\ninto the conditions of today. having so\nmuch\nrain the last couple of days and uh I\nthink everyone has changed over and over\ntheir tire choices. Woo! Got some\nbubbles coming through\nalready. This is going to be a great\nday. These women are flying.\nUh the real story was uh Gabby Traxel\ngetting off the front pretty early.\nMerida. Yeah. Um, but Gabby Traxxler was\nthe story of the morning as she went off\nthe front solo. Former road racer, had a\nmajor major crash in 2023, uh, has been\nable to bounce back from that and has\nnow devoted her time to gravel racing in\n24, and here she's back again in 25.\nYeah, Gabby again, so much as I think\nabout a 2 and 1/2 minute lead at one\npoint, which was which was really quite\nimpressive. Our women's chase is full of\nnotable athletes including the likes of\nPaige Onweller, Lauren de Cresenzo,\nMeisa Rollins, and many more. Meisa\nRollins is fighting in this chase pack.\nShe's a former winner of the Leadville\nTrail 100 and is set up for a huge day\nhere at Unbound. Let's hear a little bit\nfrom Me Lisa. Since winning Leadville, I\nwent from sort of being like a top 20\nfinisher to now I'm consistently\nfinishing top five or just outside of\nthe top five in every race and always\nsort of being a part of the main group\nor what's happening in the race. I\nwouldn't say that before I won Leadville\nI was not strong enough. It was just it\nwas something clicked and now I feel\nconfident and I'm ready to be a part of\nthe race. I mean before that I always\nstruggled with confidence and believing\nin myself and not really sure if I\nbelonged. Every time I saw myself on a\nstart line, I always kind of like\ncounted myself halfway in, not fully in.\nBut yeah, I\nthink sort of proving what I knew deep\ndown that I was capable of has sort of\nhelped me build confidence to know that\nyeah, I was selected in the Grand Prix\nto race because I can race and I can\nrace well. In these long, really, really\nhard races, you have to have some kind\nof like emotional attachment to winning\nbecause they're really freaking hard.\nAnd that's the deciding factor in the\nlast hour, in the last 10 miles, in the\nlast 5 miles, at the last moment, is who\nreally freaking wants it. Everyone's\ngoing to have some kind of low in the\nrace. Not every low is created equal,\nbut everyone will have lows. So, if you\ncan make it through your low the best, I\nthink that's who wins Unbound.\nIt's always great to hear from me. Lisa,\nbut before Divide Road, a group of four\nwomen broke away hunting down the\ncurrent leader, the Canadian Gabby\nTraxler.\nComing at about mile 45.5, Divide Road\npresents one of the toughest stretches\nof terrain on the entire route.\nFollowing Escridge, this roughly six\nmilei stretch is a straight shot with a\nrelentless onslaught of rough, rocky\npaths, setting the stage for the\nchallenges to come.\nLet's catch up with our men. We have\nthem screaming up front. It is now\nsingle file. They are pinned rolling in\n40 plus miles into this like they are\nfresh. Looks like Simone and teammate\nare doing a great job out front here\ntoday. Time to get some fuel. Keep those\ntanks topped off as much as possible.\nThe last few miles and kilometers there\nwas not any chance of grabbing a bottle\nor getting any hydration in. They were\nin the drops. There was no sitting onto\nthe hoods. The terrain was just too\ngnarly and the pace incredible today. So\nmuch stress on the front end of this\npointy group. So many new players. The\nEuros have come over, done their\nhomework, wanted to get out front. and\nthe rest of the experienced players\nhoping that they can keep that contact.\nBut man, it got narrow back\nthere. These two really pulling away\nright now. The remaining 18\nbehind, doing what they can to get\nhydrated, but they are losing a little\nbit of contact. This may be the break.\nAs Simone Po and Cameron Jones begin\ntheir breakaway, let's check in with the\nwomen.\nAll right, guys. We have just come\nthrough some of the muddy sections that\neveryone was checking out at uh pre-race\npre- rides. Gabby basically has her\nchoice of line selection. It looked like\nshe was running a more of a slick\nuh in the center of her tire with just a\nlittle bit of knobbyby on the edge. And\nwhen she came through that mud section\njust right there. I mean, you could\ndefinitely tell she was all over the\nroad and really fighting that bike and\ntrying to keep it upright. But again,\nthat's she would rather pay the price\nhere. Hence her part of her probably\nsome of her race strategy to be up the\nroad and be more efficient with that\nslick versus having a more knobbyby tire\nthat's going to bite more in that uh in\nthat mud. But yeah, she is still she's\njust smoking it right now.\nLikely for a bit\nas the women chase add another rider to\nthe hunt. Let's check in with the men.\nCam Jones and Simone Po are still\nleading at the front of the race, making\nit look awful easy. But the burning\nquestion is, will they be able to hold\non to this lead? Well, that's anyone's\nguess at this point. But for now, let's\ncheck in with Nat Ross just in front of\nthe leaders at the base of Christy Road.\nWe got the kiwi and the Swiss leading\nthe cows up the pasture here. They think\nthey're going to get fed, but these two\nreally breaking away from the main group\nout of\nsight. And look at the gap that they\nhave put down today. Very\ncohesive. These two breakaway\nstrategists have put it together. The\nformula is working for them in their\nfavor. Okay, at this aid 70 miles into\nthe race focus strategy. Cam looking for\nhis crew. Simone has got the BMC team\nout here ready to do a bottle handoff\nand then some. You can tell from the\nlenses on these guys that the visibility\nif they can get a swap of glasses or\nlenses they will take it more\nintritically. Here we go. Simone off\nwith the pack. Cam trying to get\nvisibility of his crew. Simone dropping\none\npack. There he goes. Look at that.\nSmooth from Joan. Got another pack. He\nis topped off, ready to go. Cam still\nlooking for his crew in the feed\nzone. And at roughly mile 70.6, Cam\nJones and Simone Po still lead the\nChasers by about 2 minutes. Heading out\nof our first feed zone, Po appears to\nslow down just a little bit for Cam to\ncatch back up so they can continue to\nwork together. Well, the Swiss veteran\nknows it's still a long way to go, and\nthe odds are better with a little bit of\nhelp.\nGabby Traxxer continues to maintain her\nlead heading into Christy Road, but the\ngap has significantly decreased.\nThe chase group has now dwindled to only\nthree, but they're reeling in our\nleader.\nAnd they pass her just before the feed\nzone at mile 70. Heading into this feed,\nthis gives us a new lead group\nconsisting of Lauren Stevens, Carolina\nMigon, and Cesaly Decker with a 2 and\n1/2 minute gap over Traxler and a\n7minute gap over the chase group.\nEmily,\nlet's touch base with Lauren and see\nwhat's going on at the front of our\nwomen's race.\nFast, dusty course. How does it get any\nfaster? Oh my gosh, we just seeing Caro\njust over cooking that corner right\nthere. Oh my goodness. Saving it. Coming\nback and yeah, you just got to think\neveryone is working well together. Even\nthough you say like P Normal, they may\nnot essentially be under they're on the\nsame kit, maybe not the same team, but\nyeah, everyone working well.\nAnd let's just stop and take a moment to\nrecognize just how amazing our athletes\nare. While leading the race, Simone Po\npulls out chain lube and offers to help\nlube Cam Jones chain while they're\nracing. Sure, it gives them an advantage\nto continue riding with a partner to\nshare the workload at the front, but\nwhat a class act.\nAll right, we're here at the notorious\nLittle Egypt, mile 104. It's a 2.3 mile\nlong section. It includes two descents\nand two climbs. And you drop down into\nthis descent first and it gets narrow\nreally quickly as you come around a\ncorner, kind of off camber corner across\nthis bridge, dive into these trees. It's\nbeautiful. It's one of my favorite\nsections. And right now there's a bunch\nof standing water right at the bottom in\nthat in that turn. Absolutely single\nfile through here. Um I remember\nactually last year uh Mate Mahoric, the\ncurrent world champion, double flatted\nright in this section, but it just\ncauses mayhem. The climbs are hard, but\nthe descents are absolutely as decisive.\nSo this is the first climb of two on the\nlittle Egypt section. It's really steep,\none of the steepest climbs on course.\nIt's really narrow, but everyone talks\nabout the rocks. Um, regardless of\nwhether all the potentially muddy\nsections on the rest of the course dry\nout or not, this part will be gnarly cuz\nit's rocky. Um, you can see just how big\nthe stones are and because uh it's\ngetting to be, you know, make or break\ntime in the race. People are getting\ntired. Line choice is really tough. A\nlot of times there's really only one\ngood line because of how rocky it is. If\nyou want to switch sides on the two\ntrack because someone else in front of\nyou is losing the wheel in front of you,\nit's going to be hard to switch lanes.\nUm, this this section is just notorious\nfor being pivotal in the race. And a lot\nof it is because of this climb right\nhere. Here come our two leaders around\nthe corner just about to enter into\nLittle Egypt. Pillow and Jones are still\nway off the front at this point. about a\n7-minute lead ahead of the Pelaton going\ninto the very same spot. And we'll jump\nback in time and see the Pelaton coming\naround that very same corner again,\nnearly 7 minutes down and trying their\nhardest to catch up to these two leaders\nwho seem absolutely unstoppable on the\nday. As our men's chase group now heads\ninto Little Egypt, we've got Keegan\nSwenson, Toby Reed, Brendan Johnston,\nIan Boswell, Yasper Oakleion, and Yurus\nAnnewenhouse. Let's see if this\nstar-studded group can make any headway\ninto catching our two\nleaders. One of those men in the chase\ngroup, the Frenchman, Ugo Du,\nunfortunately found himself just a\nlittle spent at Little Egypt and decided\nto pull out of the race. I was expect\nexpecting one better day because it's my\nbirthday today,\nbut I decided to to to don't continue\nbecause uh was uh was impossible today.\nWell, I'm sorry to hear that. What What\ndo you want to say to Axel to cheer her\non? She's very very strong. She very\nstrong. I I'm the first uh first love of\nfirst love of Axel. So, yeah.\nI will I will follow this with for sure.\nWe see Paige Onweller on screen and we\ngot a chance to catch up with Paige\nbefore the race and here's what she had\nto say.\nMy name is Paige Onweller and I am a\nprofessional off-road cyclist. I ride\nbikes fast sometimes. This is one of the\nbikes I'm going to race. This is likely\nthe race bike. Uh this is a checkpoint\nset up with two twos front and rear. Uh\nit's what we call the the beefy boy. So\nwe are about just over a week out from\nUnbound. I head there early because I\nreally like the community and I love the\nriding there. All right, bike number\ntwo. It's such a important race and an\nimportant week that you really do need a\nlot of extra time to prep everything and\nrecon. The amount of equipment that you\nneed to bring to unbound is pretty\ninsane. More wheels, more bikes. Uh,\nthis is a new bike. Me personally, I\nhave really good support. I'll be\nbringing two bikes and five wheel\nsets. That just speaks volumes to the\nequipment that you need, but also the\ncarnage of the\ncourse. You have to have your equipment\ndialed. You have to have backups. You\ngot to be ready to break anything during\nrecon week and have another ready to\ngo. In 2023, I had pretty bad mechanical\nthat ended my day. You come to expect\nthese mechanicals and you also come to\nrespect the race. I line up at Unbound\nknowing there's a chance that I have a\nday ending mechanical again. You have to\naccept\nthat it can be gut-wrenching to say the\nleast. You build your whole first part\nof the year for this race.\nSo to come back and have such a good\nyear just meant a lot. It was really\nvalidating because that race and that\ncommunity is just important to me and I\nwant to do well there. 2024 Unbound set\nthe precedent for gravel for all\nevents. Historically, gravel has always\nbeen a mass start event. So the elite\nmen, the elite women, and amateurs, we\nall start\ntogether. However, in 2024, Lifetime at\nUnbound, they did a separate start. And\nthat was the first time the women truly\nhad our own\nrace. We had a nineup sprint for the win\nat Unbound, which is amazing. We showed\nthe world how cool and how strong and\nhow dynamic like our race can be.\nIt's just a totally different\nexperience. That was the first time\nwe've ever raced together, all of the\nIn the end, I feel like we really put on\nthe show that we're capable of. Good\njob. No matter what my result would have\nbeen today, that was definitely the\nhighlight of the race. And it's just so\ncool to see the women like doing it.\nUnfortunately, Paige was dropped from\nthe chase group at just after Little\nEgypt. So maybe not the day she'd been\nhoping for. You know, every year we go\nfaster. I think there's no way we can\npossibly go faster and then it just\nhappens again. The depth of field just\ncontinues to increase. Um, all that\nsaid, I do think there could be some\nhistorically fast conditions this year.\nUh, that all that rain that we got\nmidweek. Um, like Nat was kind of\nreferencing, does create some extra\ntackiness and traction in those corners.\nUm, and even on a course like this\nthat's so long, that's so rugged, um,\nthat doesn't have as many twists and\nturns maybe as some other gravel\ncourses, um, traction still does matter.\nMomentum absolutely matters. And even\nthough those might be small differences\nover the course of 200 miles, it all\nadds up. But right now, we're looking at\nour women's the chase group. It's now\ndown to eight riders. So curious to see\nif that gap is going to come down. We\nsee G in there. We see Sophia in there\nas well. So yeah, again, we wonder if\nmaybe there's a little more unity. Maybe\nthere's a little more cohesion in there.\nUh LDC at the back of the just a rut.\nYeah, she just got sideways in a rut and\nit was uphill, too. Uh, it's devastating\nto see LDC crash like that. She's so\nwell known for her breakaway game, but\nit looks like this year may not be in\nthe cards.\nHere's the dust off. This was a prize in\n2021. This is my belt buckle. Should\nreally do something with this, like turn\nit into a belt or something. So, I am\nknown as a bit of a breakaway\nspecialist. It's my signature move, I\nguess.\nI do a lot of things that just feel\nright in the\nmoment. Just the solo\nbreakaways. Ultimately, I just really\nlike riding by myself. I\nthink I like taking the risk. People are\nscared to do it, but I like to be brave\nand embark on like 90 mile breakaway.\nHer second win at the rat. She's got to\nbe so happy with this. I'm willing to\ntake the chance and do what it takes. I\nhate placing expectations on myself\ncoming into these races. The feel is as\ndeep as ever. The competition is\nstacked. All I can do is have my own\nbest personal performance. And it's like\nRussian roulette out there. Anything can\nhappen at Unbounds. As long as I know I\ncan put it all out there, I'll be\nstoked.\nWell, getting back up from her crash,\nLDC was able to catch it back up to the\ngroup and hang on. So, well, maybe her\nday isn't over after all. Um, you can\njust have a a little crash at any\nmoment. That doesn't help the morale. It\ndoesn't help you physically. It's just\nanother barrier on top of the distance,\non top of the heat, on top of the wind,\nand on top of the competition. Let's\ntouch base with the men. The the chase\nbehind has a lot of work to do. There is\nstill a small group between Oh, we got a\ncrash here. Keegan's down. Keegan is\ndown. Jeez, that's a big blow. We've not\ntalked about him a whole lot today. And\nthis is not the way we wanted to talk\nabout him. That's the thing, you know,\nthere there are technical sections on\nthis course, but a crash like that can\nhappen anywhere. That was a dead\nstraight section of road. Looks pretty\nsmooth, and it just takes a a quick uh\nquick moment, and your race can\ncompletely change.\nSimon, you're definitely showing some of\nthe the signs of strain as well. So,\nyeah, anybody's guess right now as both\nriders wearing that fatigue uh very\nclearly on their shoulders. This is one\nof our men's chase groups and on one of\nour other camera angles a minute ago, I\nsaw one of the SWAT club guys literally\nstop pedaling and start stretching,\nwhich means cramps. Um, and it looks\nlike this main chase group has\ncompletely exploded at this point.\nWindow of opportunity is is not it's not\nclosed completely, but it's it's it's\nreally come down a lot. I mean, I think\nreally they would have had to have kind\nof lit that fire almost an hour ago at\nthis point cuz that gap was so big. And\nyou know, you know, the the shorter the\nrunway gets, the the less time you have\nto really get this done. So with our men\nnow through feed zone number two at\nCouncil Grove, Cam Jones, and Simone Po\nare still in the lead with now a\n9-minute gap over the chasing group. Our\nleading trio of women, Cararolina Migon,\nLauren Stevens, and Cesaly Decker\ncontinue to add time over our chase\ngroup through feed zone number two. That\ngap now stands at nearly 14 minutes.\nBut that doesn't last long because just\npast mile 148 is when we start to see\nsome cracks in our leading trio.\nKarolina puts down the hammer and while\nCesley tries to respond, Lauren gets\ndropped off the back. This leaves\nCarolina in the lead of our women's race\nwith Cesaly Decker trailing in second\nand Lauren getting caught by the chasing\ngroup coming up from\nbehind. The four women catching up and\npassing Lauren are last year's winner\nRosa closer, Cesily Ljun, your series\nleader Sophia Gomez, Avisha Fany, and\nLauren de Cresenzo. And you know, early\non, I always like to say early in a bike\nrace, everyone feels good, but\neventually you have to pay the piper.\nUm, and I think we're seeing that now.\nIt has become a race of in large part\ngroups of twos and threes, maybe four,\nwhich is different than last year. Yeah,\nit's it's vastly different than uh than\nany addition I've seen. You know, very\noften we see those small breakaways, but\nthen it's generally a reasonable size\nchase group coming up from behind as now\nyou can clearly see our riders going\nalong the top of the the Cahola Lake\nthere. And you know, again, a wide open\nsection there kind of on both sides. And\nso I imagine a a good bit of wind coming\nacross. It looks like they're actually\nin little bit of an echelon formation\nthere. of the wind probably coming from\nuh the right just a little bit. The\nupper right there is they're flying.\nYeah, they're moving right. It's so easy\nto see using the those cement blocks in\nthe background as an indicator.\nOkay, we're here at mile 176 on Kola\nHill, which happens to be the longest\nclimb on the course. It's about a half\nmile long. Not very long as uh compared\nto maybe some other climbs out there,\nbut you hit it really deep in the race.\nUm it looks like on Saturday it's going\nto be hot, it's going to be sunny. This\nclimb is also super super exposed. If\nit's windy, there's nowhere to hide. Um\nback in 2019, I remember actually\ncramping on this hill, even though it's\nnot that long. So, uh once once you're\nthat deep into the race, um Kola Hill is\ndefinitely really going to hurt. And one\nother cool thing about this section of\nthe course is most of the pros will be\ncatching a lot of the hundred mileers at\nthis point. And oftentimes there's a\nlong line of people even just walking up\nthis climb cheering for the pros as you\nknow we rip by trying to decide our\nrace. So uh it's a classic part of the\nUnbound course.\nWell, Kola Hill, the real deal. It is\npointing straight up. There are a lot of\nfolks going different speeds. You can\nsee the excited folks don't know what's\ngoing on. Cam, just a little bit of tap\nsaying, \"Guess what, guys? We are\nrolling through.\" Kind of like the tour,\nkind of like the Gro on those mountain\ntops. This is out in the Flint Hills.\nThese two are now trying to stay keep\ntheir momentum. What a gap they have\nover the chase. They know it. They're\ngetting their first real splits. Cam\nsoaking some stuff up. Some information.\nThese guys are thirsty. It is full\nexposure out here. Once we pass the\nlake, you could just tell the winds are\nhowling. So, filling you in from the\nfield from our perspective. One more\nhill to go. Highland Hill is fast\napproaching. That's going to be the\nfinal opportunity to use any sort of an\nincline as a springboard. And we've been\nsaying it. We think Po may be uh ready\nto play out that card, but we are going\nto see here momentarily. All right, Cam.\nIn my opinion, even though he knows he\nmight be strong in her sprint, he's got\nto assume that maybe Simon is going to\nwa Look at this. Look at this. Look at\nthis. I was just going to say he's\nriding\naway. Cam Jones with the attack right\nfrom the front. So Simon Jones wasting\nno time. Po literally no response. So\nthis is the move. Cam Jones looking back\nover his shoulder out of the saddle\nagain. A big acceleration as he's now\ncoming into that deviation area. So Cam\nJones making the moves along the home\nstraight here. And I'll tell you what,\nwe couldn't have asked for a better day\ncoming across the line with a huge win\nat the 2025 Lifetime Unbound presented\nby Shimano. Cam Jones out of New Zealand\nwill be your champion on the day. Yeah.\nComing in with a welldeserved silver\nmedal and not too unhappy about it.\nTossing a bottle to the crowd. Simon\nPalo, the aggressive rider. Tourn Road\ndoing what we know he can do. He's just\nenough in the tank. Takes one look back.\nToby Road will be your bronze medalist\nhere today with a wellexecuted sprint.\nHi everyone, I am Meredith Miller and I\nam here with Cameron Jones, your unbound\n200 men's winner. Not only did you punch\nyour ticket for the wild card selection,\nso you are now in the Grand Prix for the\nrest of the year, but you won Unbound\nwith a long se uh long range attack with\none other rider. Did you plan on doing\nthat from the very beginning? Uh I think\nlike I was saying to you yesterday, I\nwas like it's probably in my best\ninterest to play it safe cuz there's\nmore than just like the race on the\nline. there's the the chance to be in\nthe Grand Prix that could potentially\nlose if I did do sort of anything\nreckless. But I was the whole time just\nsaying, \"Who am I kidding? I'm just\ngoing to ascend it.\" Um out on my wrecky\nrides. I thought that sort of towards\nthe end of Divide Road would be a nice\nplace to be in the front. It looks like\nit last year it sat up a bit and then\nthat next little loop there's some some\ntechnical stuff. It's always nice to be\nable to ride the front and actually see\nwhere you're going. It's It's safer, so\nyou when you can see any obstacles. Um\nyeah, I end up going a bit earlier than\nthan I planned. Um it sort of was all\nstrung out coming into Escridge\nand yeah, saw Keegan and my buddy Max\nsort of chopping off at the front and I\nwent to join in the fun and then rolled\nthrough and they all stopped. So I just\nlike kept on going and um I was like,\n\"Oh, I'm committed now.\" So managed to\nbridge across to there's actually quite\na big group up the road. I hadn't really\ntaken much notice of what was going on\nand they were all spread out through\nthroughout divide road and again it was\ngood to have everything sort of in\nsingle fire and spaced out so I could\nsee where I was going and just rode\nstraight through the the initial break.\nWe've got a a great chasing group, but\nthey're uh as unified as they seem,\nthey're actually losing time still.\nLet's uh check in with Lauren Hall.\nMaybe she can give us a little more\ninsight as to how these splits are going\non up there. Yeah, Bill, you know, you\nwere talking that there was only 20, 30\nmiles left, but we are in those long\nlate miles, right? And every hill is\nreally starting to add\nup. Carol is definitely starting rocking\nside by side, taking on fuel. And when\nwe were going up and over Hill, she was\ngiven the look back because she didn't\nknow that split. I think she now knows\nthe split to that chase group. But uh\nyeah, like you're saying, always\ncognizant of what's behind you, but\nCarol is definitely pushing forward. But\nyeah, Minan still looking strong.\nDecker, her teammate back there just\nabout five minutes down in this chase\ngroup. Uh maybe they were looking pretty\nunified, now looking maybe a little less\nso as they've reeled in Stevens. And we\ntalked about uh the potential for that\nearlier. They knew three riders went\noff, but that was so many hours ago that\nuh they've caught one of them now. So\nmaybe they're kind of, you know, not\nresting on their laurels a little bit,\nbut they're like, \"All right, we we kind\nof close that chapter, so we're going to\ntake just a little bit of a breather\nright now.\" And, you know, obviously\nthat's not going to help their cause\ninto uh trying to compete for those top\ntwo positions. So, here we are on\nHighland Hill, the final incline of the\nday, and doesn't have to worry about a\nsurprise attack from anybody. You know,\ncan just ride her tempo a little bit,\nand it's going to be one of the biggest\nwins as we've got uh one of our great\nfans out there, and I bet she's looking\nat that hot dog and maybe salivating a\nlittle bit about uh what's to come here\nto enjoy the fruits of her labor. She is\ncelebrating. So, what a great champion\nout here today to cap off our women's\nelite 200mile race. Round number two of\nthe lifetime Grand Prix. Your champion\njust about to get herself across the\nline. It looks to me like there's a\nwhole lot of emotion in this finish. I\nwould imagine some tears are being shed\nbecause what a day on the bike. The\ncrowd showing their love, the hands in\nthe air well before the finish line. And\nI'll tell you what, it's you couldn't\nask for a better finish in this. 2 hours\nsolo to take the win here. Silver medal\nride on the day going to go to Cesaly\nDecker. And she's looking like uh she\ncan't even celebrate right now. She's\nshe is cooked.\nAnd here comes our women's chase getting\nready to fight it out for the third step\non the podium here at Highland Hill.\nOh, Cecile making the first move\nhere. Huge acceleration from Cecil Lune\nright now. Hard to see if anyone was\nable to follow her wheel.\nNot surprised given the way that out.\nOkay, we see the wheel there. That's\nRosa right there. Yeah, Rosa. Rosa very\nquick to react. Remember when Sophia\nattacked a while ago? Rosa was the first\none to respond to Sophia. Look at\nSophia's body language, the shoulders.\nThat would Oh, look at this. One rider\ngoing the wrong way. Rosa going the\nwrong way, making that turn. So, that's\ngoing to be uh potentially a big issue\nif if Cecil Lune. Yeah, Cecil Lune\nrealizes what happened. Waiting to see\nif Sophia makes the big move around.\nRosa not making a move. There goes Cecil\nLune up along the fencing. Lun coming\nup. That door going to stay open. It's\ngoing to be Oh, this is down to the\nwire. Sophia looks like she's going to\nhave enough. Can Rosa come on by? Oh,\nall the way to the line. That is close.\nIt looks from our vantage point like\nSophia just got that one on the line.\nWhat an amazing finish.\nHey, this is Pac McKelvin with today's\nwinner, Ko, who just finished a 40mile\nsolo, 2hour solo. Tell me about what was\ngoing through your head those last\ncouple of hours. I just thought if I was\nstupid or\ngenius. Um, yeah, I I I didn't know if I\nwill make it to till the finish. I would\nsay till last 5k\nreally you you didn't know that you had\na 18minute lead well Cesaly was maybe I\nthink six seven minutes back but to the\nthird group you had a huge lead okay I I\nwas not aware I knew that Cesily was\nback but I also know know that she's\nsuper strong\nuh and you also can have a flat you can\ncrash you never know so you were on the\ngas all the way until Highland Hill or\nwhen did you allow yourself to start\nenjoying it a little bit. Uh yeah, the\nthe last uh tarmac climb then I knew\nthat I won. Uh and I started to really\nsmiling and just just couldn't\nbelieve\nHeat.\nYeah. Nothing. I'm\ndone. Heat. Heat.\nOh\nmy. Oh no.\nH\nFire."
