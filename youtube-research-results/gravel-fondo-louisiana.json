      "description": "What a great inaugural event (St. Francisville Gran Fondo)! Just focused on staying with the 1st group and on Evan's wheel as long as I could until the groups split up (20, 40, 60 mile groups). Little did I know I'd end with a 21.8 mph average! That was such a fun and stamina-building ride! I used a lot of  my experience and knowledge in riding the rolling hills throughout the ride. It's not about trying to ride fast uphill, but rather minimizing slowdown during a climb by using tactical gear-shifting. Loved having the pace car leading. It reminded me and made me \"feel\" like we were in the Tour de France! It was a great event on a beautiful day!",

pleasure\nof racing this event three times and\nI've had great luck where I managed to\nsomehow score top five in Masters when I\nwas a wee bit younger and I've had bad\nluck where I had flat tires dodgy legs\nand all sorts of goodness that\naccompanies a day on the bike where\nthings don't always go so well but that\npoint aside this is an event as I\nmentioned very worthy of your\nconsideration and hard-earned money ride\nthe tuna Hills of rouge Ru Bay further\nbelow rodo Trend Setters that wraps up\nthe list for now without doubt there are\nsome events that I've missed some events\nthat are no longer operational feel free\nto leave a respectful comment below if\nyou think there's an event worthy of\nmention keep in mind the event should be\nGrassroots as we like to

celsius with a review of a bike\ni've been putting through the ringer\nthis is the 51 bikes assassin\ngravel bike if you're a regular to this\nchannel the gravelcyclist.com website\nthe gravel cyclist instagram and\nfacebook accounts you will likely have\nseen my unboxing and features video and\nmy sneak peek photographs of my review\nprocess up to this point of this very\nbike for those folks who do not follow\nmy social media do yourself a favor and\ncheck them out in the links below first\na little company history about dublin\nireland based 51 bikes the company was\nfounded in 2016 by mr aidan duff a\nformer professional cyclist who turned\nhis hand\nto the creation of bespoke bicycles the\nname 51 is a homage to a special race\nnumber used in european professional\nroad cycling usually that number is\nreserved for team leaders or special\nwriters and originally came about around\nthe time of mr eddie merks he made that\nnumber quite famous in his heyday as i\nmentioned earlier 51 bikes specializes\nin custom bespoke bikes from their\ndublin island headquarters from special\nframe designs\nto gorgeous custom paint and other finer\ndetails this assassin gravel bike to my\nright is a departure from 51's usual\nmanner of producing bikes in that it was\nmanufactured in asia to the company's\nexacting standards this bike is\navailable with three color options\nbritish racing green as you see here\ncurrently the bike is absolutely filthy\nas it should be most of the time\nrothman's racing blue and\ncomplete bespoke paint\nanything goes from wild to mild the\nassassin features a multi-blend taurei\ncarbon fiber frame from three different\ntypes of carbon fiber with tyre\nclearance front and rear for 650b and\n700c by 47 millimeters but i'm pretty\nconfident you could fit 50 millimeter\ntires inside this bike but of course\nthat wouldn't allow for a whole ton of\nmud clearance there's also provision for\none buy or two by drivetrains and as you\ncan see in this example\na two by drive train namely the\nexcellent sram rival etap access and i\nhave a full review of that groupset\nlinked below the stock build will set\nthat arrived with this bike hold on one\nsecond\nright here\nthis is the dt swiss\ng 1800 wheel set shod with wtb riddler\ntires in 700c by 45 millimeter i saved\nthis wheel set for some of the more\ngnarly riding that i did that you'll see\nduring my ride experience part of this\nreview for much of the review\ni rode the\nexcellent and ultra light envy g23\nwheels with bird spokes you can also\ncheck out a review of this wheel set\nlinked below the assassin is touted as a\nprogressive gravel bike nowadays that\ngenerally means a longer top tube\nshorter stem almost mountain bike like\nin design 51 isn't alone with this\nconcept there are several manufacturers\ncircuit the time of this video with\nbikes designed in a similar manner this\nisn't my favorite geometry but i will\nsay 51's take has worked fabulously for\nme and i have my position locked in\nafter just one short shakedown ride the\nassassin features adjustable geometry\ncourtesy of a flip chip system at the\nfront and rear of the bike this is not\nthe first bike overview with such a\nfeature in fact this design has been\naround for a couple of years at the rear\nof the bike you get three different\npositions short medium and long an east\nposition change affects the overall\nchainstay length by five millimeter\nincrements theoretically the short\nposition gives you agility the long\nposition stability and the middle the\nbest of both worlds i rode the bike in\nthe middle position for much of this\nreview\nthe forecast two positions high and low\nlow provides longer trail and a slacker\nhead tube angle best suited to more\naggressive riding on challenging terrain\nwhilst high creates shorter trail and a\nsteeper head angle really nice for\nracing spirited rides or not so rough\nterrain i've ridden both positions\nextensively more on that later\nspeaking of geometry this is what the\nsize medium this example here looks like\non paper in the rear middle position and\non the low front position so in the\nmiddle rear and low front position you\nget a wheelbase of\n1052 millimeters or middle rear and\nfront high you get\n1057 millimeters of interest the trail\nfigures for this bike are uniform across\nthe board in all chip positions no\nmatter the size of buy and now it's time\nfor a little demonstration of how simple\nit is to swap the flip chip on the fork\ncurrently the chip resides in the bottom\nposition for this exercise i'm going to\nswap the chip to the higher position\nthus i'll need to remove the fixing bolt\nright there\nswap this around and likewise on the\nother side of the fork\n2.5 millimeter allen key required\nand you can see\nthe little flip mechanism is already\nloosened off\napologies for the bright sunshine here\nmight pop out the little\nchip\nlet's get them in focus\nthere we go flip around\nthen simply reinstall the\nfixing screw\nthat operation is done\nrepeat the process from the other side\ni have to say i've flipped a few chips\nand this one is easiest to deal with\nreinstall\nand then\ntighten down the fixing bolt\nbeing careful not to over tighten\nand reinstall the front wheel\nall right bob's your uncle no walking\nfurries\none thing you might be wondering did i\nadjust the position of the front brake\nto account for the change i made in the\nchip position that is a no\nother features of the assassin all the\ncables are internalized including\nthrough the fork the front brake runs\nthrough the right side of the fork and\nif you happen to utilize a dynamo front\nhub for generating power that also is\ninternalized through the left side of\nthe fork there's also support for an\ninternalized dropper seat post and for\nbottle cage mounts you get the usual two\nplaces one on top of the down tube one\non the seat tube and a bonus bottle cage\nmount beneath the down tube and not\nforgetting my favorite mounting point\natop the top tube in this case with an\napadura top tube racing bag and i had\nthat linked as well in the description\nbelow the fork also features mounts on\neach leg for additional versatility\nfinally the bottom bracket standard is\nthreaded t47\nand another nice feature beneath the\nremovable down to protector you get\naccess to the inside of the frame and\nfor folks who run shimano's di2\nelectronic drivetrain the battery\nresides behind that protector so that's\nthe tech features covered let's find out\nnow how the 51 bikes assassin gravel\nbike\nrides\nweighing in at near 21.5 pounds or 9.7\nkilos with the stock dt 1800 wheels\nriddler 700 c by 45 millimeter tyres\nking titanium bottle cages and garmin\nxc200 pedals the assassin isn't overly\nlight but once i swapped the wheels for\nthe envy bird spoke wheels i showed\nearlier the bike's overall weight\ndropped by close to two pounds or almost\na full kilogram of weight whilst light\nweight is not this bike's primary focus\nit's one you should spec out carefully\nif you're interested in shedding some\ngrams\non the positive it took just one 25 mile\nshakedown ride to dial in my fit and\ndespite all of my reservations about\nthis longer top tube shorter stem\nconcept the assassin felt spot on the\nbest i've felt aboard any bike of this\ntype this is handy as the second ride\naboard the assassin was 200 miles of\nflorida mixed surface roads in one day\nwest coast to east coast part of the\nkings road event hosted by the single\ntrack samurai i kept the fork in the low\nposition and the rear in the middle\nposition 200 miles isn't something you\ncan bluff in terms of fitness or bike\nsetup and this was a very solid test\nbetween the wheelbase and the long trail\nfork setting the assassin feels stable\nand predictable but steering didn't feel\noverly slow rather i feel you ghana a\nhappy medium of control for dodgy\nterrain whilst the fork imbibes\nconfidence turning into corners clearly\nthe shorter stem is helping here and at\nthe rear wheel with your weight\ndistributed appropriately you get\ntraction and power transfer something i\nreally appreciate on loose terrain i\nespecially felt this riding in dodgy\nbrick road sector complete with many\nsandy spots under the cover of darkness\nthis adventure required me to keep a\nlight touch on the handlebar and focus\non pedaling a high cadence with my\nweight pushed back\nonce i got into my groove and good\nskills do help i was the first rider\nthrough this eight mile sector of the\ndrop bar bikes that were present the\nremainder of this course was a huge\nmixed bag from fast forest roads that\nfeature more craters than the aftermath\nof a b-52 carpet bombing run and some\nhellacious washboard two tough sandy\nroads tyre clearance is impressive and\nthe taller than most bottom bracket drop\nworks perfectly for bigger tire casings\ncase in point zero pedal strikes when i\nchose to ride this bike at the 2022 tour\nde filasco a 50 mile mountain bike ride\nin north florida would i recommend\nriding a rigid bike on rooty trails\nnegative but i was decently competitive\nin the speed department with a ride time\nof just over five hours the assassin\nhandled absolutely everything i threw at\nit including some dicey moments when i\npointed towards a rooty drop off weight\nback and hope for the best to quote a\nwell used cliche this was under biking\nat its finest flipping the fork's chip\nas i demonstrated earlier is almost akin\nfrom riding a cruiser motorcycle in the\nlow position to a track focused\nmotorcycle in the higher position the\ndifference was enough to be noticeable\nand this would be a great setup for\nspirited riding and racing particularly\nwhen you're on the rear chip in its most\nforward position this wouldn't be my\nbike of choice for a shorter spirited\nmixed surface group ride with my mates\nbut when you're talking about rides or\nevents clocking over 100 miles now we're\ntalking with that said i really\npreferred the low fork setting for my\ngeneral riding about along with the\nmiddle rear chip position the assassin\njust felt extra comfortable in this\nconfiguration this is important because\nthe assassin feels quite stiff for a\nbike of this nature but with huge tyre\nclearance dropping the tire pressure\nsolves their problem i have to say i'm\nreally stoked the bike industry has\nfinally caught up with my gripes\nconcerning bike designs from just a few\nyears ago it's great to see clearance of\n700 c by 47 millimeter and greater\nnowadays around 2013 i built a drop bar\nmountain bike just to solve this tyre\nclearance dilemma for the gnarly events\ni was partaking in at the time the\nassassin doesn't feel as sprightly as\nmore performance oriented gravel bikes\nthis is evident pushing it out of the\nsaddle or climbing but this bike is bomb\nproof stable and confidence inspiring\nwhen descending or riding rough and\ndodgy terrain drivetrain support i love\nthe two buy so i'm chuffed to see the 51\nisn't jamming one by only down\neverybody's throats we like choices\noverall i like how this bike looks with\nits integrated cables beautiful paint\nand not over the top branding this bike\nwon't be for everyone but as far as\nultra versatile gravel bikes with\nadjustable chip geometry longer top\ntubes and shorter stems i feel the\nassassin is the standout option at the\ntime of this video the assassin is a\npricey bike you're looking at about\nthree and a half thousand euro or about\nus four thousand dollars for the frame\nand fork before you factor in any build\nkits wheels and so on this bike is a\nmedia sample so its spec is likely going\nto differ from the pre-built bikes\navailable direct from 51 bikes so there\nyou have it my review of the extremely\nversatile 51 assassin gravel bike i\nrealized at the time of this video there\nis a smorgasbord a plethora a cornucopia\nof gravel bikes on the market for you to\nchoose from so i hope that my review\nwent somewhere in helping you make an\ninformed purchase decision thank you for\nwatching if you haven't already please\nconsider subscribing to the gravel\ncyclist youtube channel for no\ngravel bike reviews such as this product\nreviews ride experience videos and other\nmadness as all of it is released to the\nchannel i'll see you\nin the next video\nand it's time to get my ass inside\nbecause it is freezing out here\nyou"
