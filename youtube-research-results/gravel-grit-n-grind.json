      "transcript": "[Music]\nFall is approaching and a long racing\nseason is coming to an end, but there\nare still a few races left. Gravel Grid\nand Grind, a 3-day stage race in\nHamshot, Sweden, is always a highlight\nfor me. It's close to our summer place\nand the weather is usually fantastic.\nThe race features a time stage on\nFriday, a long UCI race on Saturday, and\na shortest swap race on Sunday.\nHeat. Heat.\nIt's Friday, which means it's TT time. I\njust picked up my starting package,\nincluding my number, which I already\npinned on. I have the kit on. Then we\nhave the bike chip which I put on. And\nthen also the\nnumber plate on the back of the bike\nwhich I'm still struggling a bit with to\nget it as arrow as possible. But yeah,\notherwise in terms of bike setup um same\nas always. Biggest difference of course\num are the arrow bars just for today for\nthe TT.\nUh\nit will be\npretty technical in the first 10\nminutes, but then afterwards you hit\nlike open farm roads and it's will\nprobably make a bit of an difference\nthere. Let's see um how well it will go.\nI have no idea. I mostly bought them for\nfor my Badlands adventure. So yeah, why\nnot use them now as well just to see how\nit goes. I put them all the way down\nwithout any spaces um to be as arrow as\npossible. Not super comfortable compared\nto my other setups I've ridden so far\nwhere I had all the spaces in, but\nshould be fine for 30 minute effort I\nthink. Um then afterwards I will take\nthem off again for tomorrow to just yeah\nuse the normal handle boss. So yeah,\nthat's for the setup and then going to\nget ready now. I have about 1 hour until\nmy start time. Uh we'll warm up a little\nbit and yeah, blood sugar is pretty\nstable right now. I had a bit of a\nrougher night, but it doesn't matter so\nmuch for today as uh yeah, start time is\nat 2:00, so I had a lot of time to fix\nand get my blood sugar stable. So now\nfeeling pretty good. I had a really easy\nweek. Let's see if that helps.\nAll right, I parked at the\nfinish and the start is in slightly\ndifferent position. Going to ride there\nnow. Check out the first few kilometers\njust to see if something changed from\nthe last few years. Not according to the\nGPX.\nBut yeah, let's see how how we're doing\nthere. Um so I don't take any wrong\nturns or something like this. So yeah,\notherwise warming up now a little bit\nand then bringing the rest of the stuff\nback to the car before lining up to\nstart.\nIt's 17 km\nwith like a steep hill in the beginning\nand a steep one almost before the finish\nline. Um, which are the tough parts\nespecially for me. A bit of technical\nsection in between, but nothing too\ncrazy. Um, so it should be fine. It's\npretty dry. Two years ago was very\nmuddy, which made it even harder. But\nyeah, seems like it will be like last\nyear pretty fast. I'm excited to\nsee what my legs can do. But anyway, I\nreally like this first stage because\nit's a really good leg opener for\ntomorrow.\nOkay, short warm up done. Going back.\nOkay, back at the car now. Putting the\ncamera on the bike now and um let all\nthe other stuff in the car and do a bit\nmore warm up. But yeah, just a little\nbit of warm up now. And the blood sugar\nis already dropping. So, I'm taking a\ngel now just to be on the safe side. Um,\neven though the blood sugar will spike\nas soon as I start racing, but yeah,\nit's a bit too low now to feel really\ngood right from the start. So, taking\nthe gel now. Bit more warm up and then\nyeah, cutting to some TT footage at\nleast. I hope if everything works.\nJumping into the race footage and start\nfrom the first second on. We go up this\nsmall hill before hitting tarmac for a\nshort distance straight into the steep\nkicker which most people usually walk.\nPretty happy that I made it over and we\ngo directly into this twisty signal\ntrack where I miss on the corner and\nsecond later another one meaning this\nlittle tree.\nTwo crucial mistakes that already cost\nme a lot of time. But we keep on pushing\nstraight into another hill through\nbackyards and open fields before the\nrider that started 30 seconds behind me\ncatches me before a single track\ndescent.\nWe go through the finish area of\ntomorrow's race, which is pretty tricky\nas the gravel is super loose. And we\nfinally hit straight open farm roads and\ncan make use of the TT bus. Also, I was\nthinking\nWhile I did a few short test rides\nbefore, never had this kind of effort.\nSo, breathing got pretty hard and I was\nnot able to put down the same power as\non the normal bars. So, I kept on\nswitching a bit. I wasn't going slow,\nbut also not as fast as the other guy\nthat overtook me. And the distance kind\nof stayed the same.\nI got overtaken by the later second\nplace finisher just before going into\nthe sand and overshot another corner. I\nalso missed a shortcut here, going right\nof the bushes instead of left, which was\nthe direct way with less sand.\nThe hill at 25% is pure survival, but\nthe power and momentum are good until I\ndid not pay attention and hit this big\nstone with my front wheel, which meant I\nhad to uncip and run the last few\nmeters. This actually hurt more than\nriding.\nAt this point, I'm close to seeing\nblack, and the lack of focus meant that\nI missed out on another turn, having to\ngo around and accelerate\nI used my last bit of power and push\nthrough the finish with a time of 30\nminutes and 40 seconds. A decent\nimprovement from last year, which was 34\nminutes and 30 seconds.\nJust finished stage one. Insanely tough.\nVery one day. Um yeah, finished in 30\nminutes. Uh 31 minutes and 30 seconds.\nThat's another 2 minutes faster than\nlast year. So pretty happy with that.\nEven though it definitely was not enough\nfor any decent placement. We'll check\nlater what I placed. Uh there were\ndefinitely quite a few people who got\nclose to the 30, maybe even faster. Um\nbut yeah, still very happy with that. Uh\nthat I got faster than last year. Um not\nsure if the arrow bus helped that much\nif you're not used to it. Uh and doing a\nhard effort uh getting the breathing\ncorrect. It's pretty hard. I was really\nout of breath and felt like puking in\nthe end, which I think has a lot to do\nwith riding in the position and yeah,\ncouldn't quite put the same power down\nas maybe riding in the hoods. I always\nswitched a bit. Uh but yeah, was still\nfine. Uh worth a try and good warm up\nfor tomorrow.\nAnd yeah, let's see. I think blood sugar\nfeels pretty good. Have to check the\nwhat it is at right now. didn't bring\nthe phone, but yeah, let's see where\nwe're at.\nSpiking upwards. Can't see the actual\nnumber right now, but\nyeah, the gel plus the effort in the\nbeginning as expected. But yeah, brought\nsome leftover breakfast now to quickly\neat uh recover for tomorrow. Driving\nback to the summer place now and\nrelaxing. Going to the ocean maybe and\nthen get ready for tomorrow for the big\nrace. Really excited about that one. See\nhow long I can hold on to. But yeah, see\nyou tomorrow.\n[Applause]\nGood morning and welcome to day two and\nstage two. Today's the big one, the UCI\ngravel race, which is 140 km\nand about 1,700 m of elevation. few\npunchy climbs will be really tough to\nget over them with uh the strong guys\nwhich are lined up today. A lot of big\nnames. Um so yeah, I'm just out to have\nfun today. Uh not too worried about my\nperformance too much, but it's a good\nopportunity to try a few new things. Uh\nwent really carb heavy on the breakfast\ncompared to my usual rather high protein\nbreakfast. see how that works out. So\nfar, the blood sugar is pretty stable. A\nbit to the higher end, so we'll warm up\nnow. See how it goes. Um, and then maybe\ninject right before we start if it's uh\nstill mid to higher end. Um, but yeah,\notherwise, same bike setup as yesterday,\njust no more TT bars. Um,\nwe'll check in soon with my fueling\nstrategy, but it's the same as in the\nother races as well. So, nothing new\nthere. And then, yeah, we'll see if I\ncan find my teammates now and warm up\nwith them.\nAnd then it's already race time in less\nthan one hour.\n&gt;&gt; And we're off for the big one with a\nshort neutralized start that is already\nfull gas from the gun. I know from last\nyear that we will shortly hit the big\ntarmac road where the speed will drop.\nSo I tried to save as much energy trying\nnot to get any mechanical kills. We hit\nthe first climb which is small split\ninto like three four smaller climbs with\nplateaus in the middle and the speed is\nalready insanely high.\nThanks to the flatter parts, it's not\ntoo hard to hang on yet. And I managed\nto have a really good descent, making up\na lot of positions. The vibes are high\nat this point, but I also already spend\na normalized power of 420 W in the first\n30 minutes, something that I cannot\nsustain for 4 hours.\nAt kilometer 21, we under approach for\nthe next big climb, but I'm really\nstruggling to keep the same speed as a\npelaton. At only 3 4% I'm doing over 440\nW and still go backwards. And before we\neven hit the actual climb, the group is\nalready gone.\nNow it's solar running, but I also know\nthat I won't be able to catch the front\nanymore. And the next group behind me is\ncoming. So I try to keep the effort\nsteady. Eventually I get caught after a\nwhile and I jump on the group. Finally a\nbit of time to relax and recover.\nThe next big clamp does not offer any\nproblems, but the one after splits the\ngroup into smaller pieces and I end up a\nbit too far in the back. A short solo\npush brings me back to the chasing group\nright when we hit the next longer tarmac\nsection\nand is around 20 km of rolling hills\nwhich are pretty easy and offer good\nrecovery before the next exercise part\nwould come. The group is still pretty\nbig and we're fighting for position\ngoing into a narrow bike path. From\nthere into a short but steep and\ndecisive climb which already split the\ngroup in a dozen pieces in the past few\nyears. It's not only the climb but also\nthe long section after which is very\nfast with a few steep kickers making it\nreally hard to get back if you miss out\non the fast group.\nI'm not in the best position and sadly\nmiss out on the front. So I have to\nsettle for the third group at this\npoint. We push at a good speed and catch\na lot of guys that fell off the front\ngroups, but not much happens until\nkilometer 91 where we hit the next\nlonger climb.\nI sadly cannot go the same speed as the\nfastest guys in our group. And it splits\nright when the rougher part of the track\nstarts. At this point, it's just up and\ndown on pretty rough gravel until a\nkilometer 108 where we have the last\nlonger climb. During that section, I\nalso dropped the guys behind me and I'm\nin Lord at this point.\nI find a few lonely souls here and there\nand we become a pretty big group until\nkilometer 120. We have a decent speed\nand not too much left to get the race\nover with.\nAt kilometer 130, we go through a\nmountain bike park with a last climb and\na pretty rough descent where the group\nslits again. Some in the front, others\nin the back, and I get to ride the last\n10 km alone.\nWe crossed the finish line after 4 hours\nand 20 minutes. Still really happy with\nthe numbers. 300 W average and 350\nnormalized power for almost 4 and 1/2\nhours is pretty crazy. A bit faster\ncompared to last year. While the race\noverall was also a lot slower. Still\nvery far away from where I want to be.\nAs you can see, it's all about getting\nfaster on those short times.\nafter\nmy last wheat.\n&gt;&gt; What is it? country.\n&gt;&gt; Finished the race a while ago as you\nmight have seen now. Went pretty okay.\nThe level in the elite category is\ninsanely high as expected. Uh couldn't\nstand a chance there on the climbs, but\nstill happy with my performance. Uh\ntechnically I rode really well. I had\ngood power overall. Um, it's really\nabout getting the watts per kilo up now.\nUm, it's the missing puzzle piece. Uh,\nlet's see. That's a project for the\nwinter for next year. Uh, see how well I\ncan do that. Um, but yeah, anyway, uh,\nwe just had a podium ceremony for pair\nwho finished first in his age category,\nwhich is super nice. So hopefully he\nwill join us in the at the World\nChampionship in October. Uh, that would\nbe super fun. And he also has a priority\nbox now. Um, nutrition wise, I already I\ndidn't film it, but I smacked down this\nwhole box with noodles. Um, just to get\nthe recovery going for tomorrow. Um,\notherwise blood sugar. I'll also overlay\nit. But it was pretty perfect. Really\nhappy with it. I noticed one dip a bit\nbefore the finish, maybe 25, 30 km\nbefore. Uh, so I had to take two gels\npretty fast. So I had a little bit of a\nyeah down moment there, but overall\nstill really happy with it. Um, I need\nto check and we'll also overlay it how\nmany carbs I had in total. 2 * 19 the\nbottles I think and then\nthree gels or something like that. Um,\nso yeah, could have been maybe a bit\nmore for 4 hours and 20 minutes of\nracing, but I didn't feel like I lacked\nany energy. uh see how the recovery is\ngoing. But yeah, driving home now for\ndinner. Uh even more food and then try\nalso to get some protein in. But yeah,\nthat's it from here. Uh tomorrow we head\nto uh different part of Hamstat, a bit\noutside uh for the last stage, stage\nthree, 96\nkm I think. So a bit shorter, but a\nreally steep tough climb right in the\nbeginning. So yeah, we'll be as hard as\ntoday, I would say. Um, but it's part of\nthis wake up Cup, so I want to place\nthere pretty decently, get some points.\nUm, see if I can finish maybe in the top\n10 there by the end of the season as I\nalso plan to race the last wake up race.\nSo, but yeah, that's the plan for\nGood morning. Welcome to day three in\nstage three. Last day we have about 100\nkilometers and 1,000 m of elevation.\nAnother tough day. Um the track starts\nwith like a\nquite long punchy climb, 5 minute effort\nor something like this. Uh but yeah, if\nyou make it over the top, it's flat for\nquite a while. Um before it's mostly in\nthe second part of the track. So the\ngoal is to survive that first climb\ntoday. I I don't know. I slept pretty\ngood, but um HIV is really bad and the\nsleep score was also really bad. Um, so\nyeah, let's see how good the legs will\nbe today. Uh, it will be really hard to\ntell from the\nYeah, just now standing here. Right now\nit feels pretty okay. But let's see once\nwe start. Blood sugar is again a bit\ntowards the higher end, but that worked\nperfect yesterday. So I will inject a\nbit before um starting\nbike setup. Exactly the same. No changes\nthere. Um so yeah,\n45 minutes to start, I think. Uh we'll\nwarm up a bit, recon the last kilometers\nbecause that's um a technical single\ntrack descent. Um just to see what's\nhappening there. Okay, checked out the\nlast 2 km. I think not too much of a\nproblem. Same as last year. I injected\neight units now 20 minutes before the\nstart. just um yeah to counter the\ninitial spike again. Also, I'm al only\nrunning two bottles with cup mix. Um so\nI definitely want to avoid to get a high\nblood sugar right from the start because\nI have no normal water with me. But\nyeah, otherwise I'm going to bit warm up\na little bit more and then just see how\nit goes. We'll jump into the race\nfootage now hopefully and yeah, you will\nsee me surviving the first climb and\nthen yeah, we'll see how it goes up from\nthere.\nThe race began with a mastad where all\ncategories took off simultaneously\nresulting in a large field. After only a\nfew hundred meters, we encountered our\nfirst climb. I knew that maintaining the\nfront would be crucial as the climb\nflattened out after a while allowing me\nto conserve energy for the first half of\nthe race until the next climb. Despite\npushing 500 W for 5 minutes, I missed\nout on the front and had to settle for\nthe chase group. This was a challenge in\nitself as the gap to the point was\nrelatively small. We pushed hard to\ncatch them, but I was struggling to\nrecover from the initial effort and\nevery little kicker hurt.\nLike yesterday, I felt a lack of speed.\nI was pushing well over 400 watts here,\nbut the group in front of me slowly\nfaded away. Fortunately, a few corners\nbrought the speed down and I was able to\ncatch up. However, being in the back of\nsuch a large group was not ideal. I\nwasted a lot of energy and I knew that\nthe pinch point was coming up.\nUnfortunately, I didn't have the legs to\nmove up.\nWe hit the pinch point shortly after\nwhich was a short but steep kicker with\nloose gravel. I ended up in the back of\nthe chaos and the group split into a few\npieces.\nI kept pushing as the next part was\nrelatively flat, but sadly the rest of\nthe guys was just sitting in my wheel.\nEventually, the group behind us caught\nup and I jumped on their wheel. At this\npoint, I really felt low on energy and\nevery little kicker slowed me down a\nlot. People overtook me, but then they\ntake really bad lines in corners, so I\novertake them again until the next\nkicker. This went on for a while, but\nwas super exhausting, and I didn't have\nthe energy to push a bit further in the\ngroup.\nAfter finishing my bottle and the gel\npretty quickly, I finally felt my energy\nreturn. I was able to move up in the\nfront and things already got a lot\neasier.\nHeat.\nWe had a smooth ride until almost 2/3\ninto the race when we hit a longer\nclimb. As always, the group got a small\ngap over me over the crest of the hill,\nbut a fast downhill after meant that I\nshould be able to close the gap again. I\nmissed the road sign and took a wrong\nturn. Sadly, I only noticed it a couple\nof hundred meters later when my AU ped\nme. I turned around and after a pretty\nrough descent, we hit a longer tamic\nstretch. Sadly, the group was long gone\nand I had to ride by myself for the next\n15 km until the next group caught up to\nme.\nI was pretty cooked at this point and\njust hung onto that group. Sadly, the\ncamera died shortly before the finish,\nbut no more splits until the last climb\nright before the finish happened. The\ngroup brought more or less together into\nthe finish.\nAll right, stage three done. As you've\nseen now, it's been a bit of a roller\ncoaster.\nvery dirty, but heading straight to the\nsummer place now and then into the ocean\nuh to clean up and enjoy the last proper\ndays of summer here in Sweden. Next week\nis going to be colder, so need to make\nthe best out of it.\nQuick little dip in the ocean dun which\nwas really nice and refreshing. Um, now\nfinally had the chance to actually look\nat my blood sugar a bit from the race\nand noticed that it was overall a bit\ntowards to the lower end\nwhich definitely explains a little bit\nthe dips I felt during the race. Um,\nI think going for the same strategy as\nyesterday was maybe not the smartest\ndecision in the end. I should have\ninjected a bit less before the race\nmostly because I assume the glycogen\nstoages\nI didn't manage to fill them up quite as\nmuch. So when we had the initial\nuh climb in the beginning,\nit didn't release as much uh yeah\nglucose from the stoages. Um, so in\nhindsight, the blood sugar didn't rise\nas much as expected. Um, which could\nhave been a problem, but yeah, it's\nstill crazy.\nSame as yesterday, the race was a lot\nslower. Um, as last year, I think last\nyear I had 2 hours and 40 minutes or\nsomething like this, which was like the\nwinning time today. So, yeah,\nlet's\nnot sure what to do with that weekend\nyet. Um, but yeah, going to have some\ndinner now and enjoy the last day here\nin the summer place before we're heading\nback to Stockholm."

      "transcript": "you know\nwelcome to stunning's Bow Sweden so\nwe're near helmstad which is where the\nnext race is this weekend so there's a\nthree-day stage race I'm actually only\ngoing to do stage two and stage three\nbecause I did the stage race last year\nand I just think that for me it's more\nimportant to get a better result on\nstage two which is the UCI race didn't\ncare about with like oval stage race\nso this is our home for the next week\nthank you\nhello I am in halstad in Sweden and I've\ncome for a little explore pre-race I'm\nactually not racing tomorrow so I'm just\ngonna come and support tomorrow but yeah\nthis is a really really cool City and I\ndidn't come last year so last year I\ncame in raised it but I actually didn't\ncome and explore the city so I'm going\nto take myself a nice coffee and an\nexplore just found out according to the\nmap that there's a castle in helmstad so\nI'm on a mission to find the castle\nwe're adapting and overcoming\nspectacularity is really hard so I've\ngot my coffee and my bun my cinnamon bun\nI'm ready to go cheer\n[Laughter]\nwe've got a cinnamon bun\nthis is FICO it's that time of day isn't\nit\nthat's him okay\nbye\ngo go\nhe's going fast\nyeah f r e d\ncheese\nGojo go go\ngo go go go go go go go you got this\nyeah you do\nrace day morning I have my classic rice\nand yogurt I think I had a bit too much\nrice because I felt a bit ill later on\nI am scared be excited\nsee just full gas\nstage two was a UCI race and it started\nwith this Mass start neutral section of\nwomen only and I actually found this bit\nquite hard because I don't like road\nracing for a reason and it felt a bit\nlike the start of a road race and I\ncan't really move up very well in fact I\nwas actually just moving backwards as\nyou can see here and I didn't go into\nthis first Scrabble climb in a very good\nposition which definitely affected my\nrace so I realized at this point that I\nwas really far back and I needed to\ndefinitely move forward\n[Applause]\n[Music]\nso I'd record the course but I also did\nrace a course on this circuit last year\nand I was realizing at this point it was\na five minute climb and I just had like\nanother couple of minutes to go but we\nwere going pretty hard at the start and\nI knew it would be like this and this\nwould be potentially like The crucial\nmoment where the group would kind of\nsplit up so I tried to keep as far\nforward as I could and I actually got\ntowards the front about here but I do\nthink I maybe worked too hard to try and\nmove forwards after the initial kind of\ngroup section in the neutral zone where\nI was too far back but yeah so we're\ncoming to the top of the climb around\nhere and I'm very relieved to be there\nand I don't really know what happened\nbut I think in this moment I sort of\nslightly switched off and I I lost the\nwheel here the girl in front of me lost\nthe wheels and suddenly I was like oh my\ngosh now I'm falling off the back of\nthis group and it was just too hard to\nget back on at this moment I just\nthought can I get back on and honestly\nmy legs couldn't do it\nyou can see here I'm literally just\nhanging off the back but honestly I'd\ndone my second all-time best five minute\npower and there was just nothing left in\nme and I could just see them leaving and\nI knew this would be absolutely crucial\nand completely affect my result\nafter some time alone a group of girls\ncame up behind me and I realized it was\nsort of like a chasing group who was\nstarting to work together so I started\nriding with them but did realize that we\nweren't going at a pace that we were\never going to catch the group in front\nup\nI did manage to kind of drop this group\nwith this girl and we worked together\nfor a bit before I then dropped her and\nthen worked on my own and I think this\ncrucially this period of time where I\nwas either kind of like sitting on the\nback of some men who'd like lost five\nminutes on us or just completely on my\nown I was working way too hard so like\nyou can see him these men were five\nminutes in front of us oh there's a\nbottle from Josh thanks Josh I was so\nthirsty so I was really really thankful\nthat Specter gave me a bottle as well\nbecause I actually needed two bottles\nthat was a bottle from Cara too\nforeign\nhad a lot of climbing in it and it had\nquite quite significant climbs and I was\njust working way too hard and I had no\nidea that the group of women who I\ndropped were working together as like a\nbig Peloton and it like scooped up other\nwomen and were behind until this moment\non this climb where I turned around I\nsaw like 30 women behind me just\nbasically riding like it was a road race\nso I realized that there was no way I\nwas going to get away from them I tried\non this climb here so on this climb\nwhere a lot of people having to get off\nit was pretty loose surface me and one\nother girl did actually manage to get\naway and get quite a bit of distance but\nas soon as we hit the road again they\njust kind of came through as a big group\nso it was just impossible the race\nitself wasn't like technical enough or\nreally rough enough it wasn't hard\nenough really to be able to like\nseparate people out people were able to\njust kind of ride as a big Peloton so we\ngot caught again and then I rode with\nthe group for a bit because I was like\nwrong now I need to try and like at\nleast finish towards the front of this\ngroup and managed to actually drop the\ngroup here on this climb\num which was quite rough in Gravelly\nly my GoPro died in the final like two\nkilometers I was with three girls at\nthis point two of them went the wrong\nway just on the last turn I shouted the\ncorrect direction but the girl in front\nwas the only one that heard me and then\nyeah crossed the line Second in that big\ngroup\nso I decided not to put my GoPro on my\nbike for stage three of the race mainly\njust because stage two didn't go so well\nso I kind of was just like ah throw the\nGoPro side I'll just see how I race it\nbut actually went really well so I ended\nup four at the start I didn't quite like\nget as far forward as maybe I could have\ndone but it was a mass start with the\nmen and the women but I managed to\nbecause it was more of a Gravelly course\nand it was actually more wasn't more\ntechnical but it was just a bit rougher\ngravel and there was like it was\npunchier at the start it was actually\npossible to kind of like break up the\ngroup so I managed to kind of drop a\ngroup of women and it wasn't as Road\nracy as maybe the second stage was which\nmeant that it was easier to kind of stay\naway and not get caught worked with\num another parkour's athlete mark for a\nbit and then managed to like get on this\nguy's wheel and just like cling on for\ndear life towards the end because he was\ngoing so fast\num and yeah finished just a couple of\nminutes behind the girls who podiumed\nand came forth which was so much better\nthis video coming up is me crossing the\nfinish line and that's all I've got\nyou know I was catching I could see you\nagain\nno please just give up let me get on\nhe's going so hard\ny we made\na beautiful salad\none thing that's great about Sweden is\nthese like robot lawn mowers everywhere\nand they are like queens and kings of\nrecycling that's called it sorted\nMikey this is actually so good\nyou've made it this far into my content\nthen clearly you don't absolutely hate\nit so give me a subscribe on my channel\nand yeah follow up on future Adventures"
