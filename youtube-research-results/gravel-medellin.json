It's really small.\nWho's that?\n&gt;&gt; Hello.\n&gt;&gt; We're in Colia.\n&gt;&gt; I just woke up and now we're getting\nfood.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, this looks so good. Look at this\nmenu. Where's the cute dog gone?\n&gt;&gt; Oh, hey, Maddie.\n&gt;&gt; Hello. Hello. We've already ended up\nbrunch.

We\n&gt;&gt; we have arrived in Med\u00ed\njust exploring El Ratiro and oh my god\nI've already seen so many little cafes\nthat are so cute.\n&gt;&gt; The major is actually a cyclist.\n&gt;&gt; Really?\nNo way.\n&gt;&gt; Hello from Eliro. We're out for a little\npoodle and it is gorgeous.\nLook at that.\nWe are just out having a good time.\nUm seeing what however many% obstacle\nfeels like. So far it's okay.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so far it's all good.\n&gt;&gt; It's okay. We definitely felt it a bit\non some of the steep climbs and the guys\nwho were just attacked from the climb\nand we said no, we're staying zone two\ngorgeous. Oh yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Insane.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, we finished our ride and look at\nthat.\n&gt;&gt; That's so nice.\n&gt;&gt; So nice.\n&gt;&gt; Insane. This is just in the town square.\n&gt;&gt; Look at us. for matching. Look.\n&gt;&gt; Um, we're going to go look for\nChiongest.\n&gt;&gt; So, we found somewhere to have chocolat.\nOh my god, it's happening. Okay. What?\nOh, do you leave it in?\n&gt;&gt; Actually, you put it here.\n&gt;&gt; You pour it in there.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, it's like a soup.\n&gt;&gt; That was a\nOkay. What's the review, KPash?\n&gt;&gt; Amazing. Better than Switzerland coffee.\n&gt;&gt; Oh,\n&gt;&gt; what is it? The cheese that makes it\nbetter.\n&gt;&gt; Of course. Colombian cheese.\n&gt;&gt; We've done it. We're trying it. We've\ngot our chocolate.\nThere's the queso.\n&gt;&gt; We're doing something crazy right now.\n&gt;&gt; Okay. It's getting better as the cheese\nis melting. It's basically cheese in hot\nchocolate. So, you combine sweet and\nsalty together. And it's a Colombian\ndelicacy. We've been hearing about this\nfor the past year in Chile. And the\nphrase is\n&gt;&gt; No idea what that means.\n&gt;&gt; Final review. Scores on the doors. What\ndo you think?\n&gt;&gt; Scores on the doors.\n&gt;&gt; Would you do it again?\n&gt;&gt; I would give it an eight out of 10.\n&gt;&gt; Wow, that was high.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I would give it an Maybe it's cuz\nI was really hungry, but\neight out of 10 is pretty good. What\nabout you?\n&gt;&gt; I would have it again. I wouldn't quite\nsay it was eight. Like I'm not going to\nbe running to find it, but if we come\nacross it again, I'll have it again.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it\n&gt;&gt; was good.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nJust a casual climb.\n&gt;&gt; What have we found?\n&gt;&gt; Bakery at 27,000 m of elevation. Look at\n&gt;&gt; 2700. Pink are going to taste different.\nLet's see. It looks good.\n&gt;&gt; We finished our ride and now we're\ngetting some lunch. This looks so good.\nWe came back to the same place cuz it\nwas so good yesterday.\nAnd the dogs.\n&gt;&gt; So cute.\n&gt;&gt; We found the most blessed gym in all of\nColumbia.\n&gt;&gt; We have.\n&gt;&gt; We will give you a tour. We will give\nyou a tour.\nmoodiness.\n&gt;&gt; Do you like this gym?\n&gt;&gt; I think this is the best gym I've ever\nbeen to in the world.\n&gt;&gt; This is\nJust getting some planks done in the\nbest gym in the world.\nOh, it's actually an ice cream window.\nice cream\n&gt;&gt; out a window.\n&gt;&gt; Look at the pistachio. That looks so\ngood. Okay, so I'm a bit torn here\nbecause salty caramel is one of my\nfavorite ice cream flavors, but then so\nis pistachio.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think he was like laying.\n&gt;&gt; did you?\n&gt;&gt; He was laying in\nhis pocket.\nyourself.\n&gt;&gt; We are here in Eliro near Median in\nColombia for a altitude training camp.\n&gt;&gt; Rather than like an altitude training\ncamp for the games, it's more to survive\nthe race that we're going to be here\nwhich is called Trans. It's an 8day\nstage race that starts on the 22nd of\nFebruary. So yeah, I'm here with Sarah.\n&gt;&gt; Hello. And yeah, we're just here riding,\nenjoying the local coffee, enjoying the\nlocal baked goods, exploring, and yeah,\nwe'll bring you with us on our\nadventures. What are we doing today?\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so today we are doing a social\nride. So, I don't know how many people\nare going to come, but we're doing a\nlittle social ride. It's quite a long\nsocial ride. We were like, \"Oh, like an\nhour.\" And it's like 50k with 1,300\nmeters of climbing.\n&gt;&gt; Very social. We hope it's social pace\nbecause 25% less oxygen up here. We We\ncan definitely feel it. that they don't\nseem to feel it. They hang up those\nclimbs.\n&gt;&gt; Social ride.\n&gt;&gt; Social ride. Pre-transport era with the\nhitters.\nGod, there's loads of people on this.\nLook how pretty the park is.\nHia.\nOkay.\nYou can't stay in zone two here.\nOh,\nhelloito.\nIf I can capture that.\nWow.\nHere is my La Sea.\nAnd this is the view we just got to.\nYou matched perfectly.\n&gt;&gt; What? The\n&gt;&gt; Maddiey's jersey matches the cafe.\n&gt;&gt; They warmed up my banana bread, so it's\nlike melted chocolate.\n&gt;&gt; We like that happy\nmilk flat white.\nThe second Colombian cinema I'm trying.\nThis is definitely hot as well. God,\nthey really know. They know that they\nneed to warm up. And they put icing on\nit, which I wasn't expecting.\nThat's better than the previous one.\n&gt;&gt; Wow. Look at that.\n&gt;&gt; 5 hours on the bike. That's going to\nkill me the first hour.\nMassage time.\nIt's rest day. So, we're having a little\nmassage. You\n&gt;&gt; excited?\n&gt;&gt; I'm so excited for a massage. There's\nnothing I want more on a rest day.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, I just had the best massage of my\nlife.\n&gt;&gt; So good.\n&gt;&gt; I feel reborn.\n&gt;&gt; They did like the boots and then they\ndid my neck and my jaw.\n&gt;&gt; Home time. Should we go to a cafe?\n&gt;&gt; Let's go get coffee.\n&gt;&gt; This place is so nice.\nrating of this coffee.\n&gt;&gt; Colombian coffee just gets summer. Oh,\nthat's nice.\nSo, we've been here for a few days now\nand I've come out to have a look at the\ncourse. So, we did a little bit course a\ncouple of days ago and I've come back\nagain cuz there's this descent that I\nreally don't like and I'm like I kind of\nwant to do it again. It's going to be\nreally hard with a loaded bike. I'll\nshow it to you now. But yeah, the course\nis beautiful. Um hopefully I'll be able\nto have an on bike camera for during the\nrace or at least like an on body camera.\nAnd yeah, it's going to be intense. All\nthe climbs are like super short but\nsteep. It's like insane kickers where\nyou have to push over threshold which at\naltitude is just not ideal. But I've got\na big cassette so hopefully I'll be\nokay. Yeah, I don't think this does it\njustice. It's like pretty steep and it's\nreally loose and there's just like\nrubbish everywhere. So you have to avoid\npuncturing. Okay, we are on one of our\nlast little rides before the race. So\ngorgeous. Super hilly, of course. And\nthen we stopped for some orange juice,\nwhich was freshly squeezed and actually\nso good at the top of a climb.\nSo the race starts in a couple of days.\nWe are I was going to say we're more or\nless prepped. We're not really. We've\njust been training and now we need to\nswitch into race modes. So I need to\nwork out what to pack because we\nbasically have to carry everything with\nus for 8 days. So, I need to decide\nwhat's worth the wait basically. So, I\nneed to decide exactly what I'm going to\npack, exactly how I'm going to pack it,\nlike which bike packing bags I'm going\nto use. I brought kind of a collection\nof stuff from Apura so I can work out\nwhat fits best and yeah, basically limit\nmy weight, but also optimize on stuff I\ndefinitely need. Like, I don't want to\nhave any regrets. Um, this is not a race\nyou want to have regrets on what you've\npacked and yeah, work out what I'm going\nto do for nutrition. Courts arrives\ntomorrow, which is super exciting. and\nshe's going to help with some content\nover the week. And yeah, I'm so excited\nfor this next adventure. I think this\nrace looks so hard. Like I'm looking at\nthe profiles and thinking this is\ninsane. But yeah, this video is to be\ncontinued. Transcords will be my next\nvideo and I'm going to make like a short\ndocumentary film about it. And I cannot\nwait to bring you on that adventure with\nme."

      "transcript": "Ok guys! we will start in 5 minutes\nI ended up in a event called Transcordilleras,\nit's a gravel race\n8 days of pedalling, but pedalling for real!\n8 stages, with over 850km and over 22.000 mts\naccumulated in 8 days\nSelf assisted, which means that you carry your things and your clothes\nThis will be a HOW TO take the risk to participate in events like this\nBecause these events really enrich the soul, and I hope to see you there next year\nWhy its name?\nTRANSCORDILLERAS\nColombia has a particularity, it has 3 mountain ranges that crosses it from north to south\nThe west, the central and the east\nWhat's the goal of this event? ride over the 3 of them\nA moutain range goes from quite low on altitude on its valleys to really high\nThe lowest altitude could have been 200 to 250 mts\nover the sea level\nAnd the highest might have been 3.900, up in the paramo\nwhere is cold, is hard to breath\nCould have been a XC bike a better option?\nThat question if gravel or XC, man! everyone was asking me about it\nPeople are really hesitant about a gravel's bike capabilities\n5 kilos more, 8 days, bigger tires, 8 hard stages\nIt is a matter of playing with the right balance\nI would love to see a really strong XC rider that could be competitive and then see which bike could be better\nIs the archer not the arrow\nThe majority finished everyday, but my bet is for the gravel bike\nHow to get ready for this kind of event?\nTo get ready for an event of this level,\nthe most important thing is: hours on the saddle\nBecause is the only way you will understand how you will feel the day after when you will be exhausted\nI meet people there of all sort of ages,\nall sorts of styles and all sorts of bikes\nIt's a matter of being patient, go at your own pace\nYou need to get ready during all the previews rides\nin order to enjoy the week of the event\nHow many outfits do you carry with you for the 8 days?\nOne jersey, one bib, a pair of socks and that's it\nSo what are you expecting? bring 2 bibs and then the day after carry the used one?\nIs just one bib, and wash it everyday and wear it\nAnd if your mindset is, what if it goes wrong? then you better think on bringing a spare bike\nAll you need is to be optimistic and if something bad happens, you will need to sort it out at the next destination\nEssentials for cold and hot weather and mechanics\nI had a windbreaker, one gore-tex jacket\na puffed jacket for the post-ride\nBut there are some people that barely bring much,\nfor example Ardila, he only had a vest\nI also had latex gloves, neck warmer, and a spare pair of gloves and a spare jersey\nand for extreme heat, very important to consider hydration, carry salt pills and of course dring water\nand mechanic essentials:\nI had a bottle cage storage\nWhere I had a tube, a battery CR2032, a valve, a power link, also tire levers\nAlso Giant's clutch system that has a multi-tool with the essentials\nIn the handlebar, in one of the bar ends I had a bacon strips tire plugs kit\nChain lube, a CO2 cartridge, and a small pump in the back\nIn the next time will be a matter of how much I want to risk in weight in order to be more efficient\nTell us about the crash\nThe crash was part of the experience, I abuse of an ultralight wheel, an 80kilos former DH rider\nnever during my 19 years downhill career I had such a nasty crash and I had never broke so many bones\nAnd never needed a surgery with bolts and plates\nevery day you received a sticker, I missed 1. So I will need to go back next year for the one remaining\nI really enjoyed it\nand crashes are part of the game\nplans change, we suffer, and crashes make us be\ngrateful and look at the sign back there\nless is more, and this event is\nall about it. It really enriches the sole\nIs it true that the top dogs set the pace?\nDaniel Boter from Manizales, one day told me: \"when Laurence tell you to slow down, you have to\"\nBecause the top guys set the pace, and one day that I tried to set the pace, Laurence said: \"Slow down Marcelo!\"\nAnd I slowed down\nAnd just 4 kms to summit the climb they opened the gas\nFor example, to take a pee, it's also agreed and\nwhy would you say: \"nah! I won't stop\"\nDid you get some looks because of your \"enduro\" outfit?\nIf people gave me looks? of course, everyone was wearing road kits\nEven though, the shorts I was wearing were quite comfy, slim fit, thin fabric\nIn a future opportunity maybe I won't wear shorts?\nsure, why not. I might end up on road kit\nHow was the food and lodging situation?\nThe hotels where booked in advance, either way with the event or on your own\nThe event only gives you a coffee in the morning,\nand it's not a matter of being cheap\nThis is bike packing! it is you dealing with your own business\nHow to choose the right tires?\nThere are 3 important variables to consider when choosing\nTire tread, PSI's and tire size (volume)\nYou could choose a fast-rolling tire, but then\nif you have to climb in muddy conditions?\nYou won't make it\nor a really slippery descent\nmy bet was for the Rambler,\nof course, there are more fast-rolling tires\nmaybe for next year I will choose a faster rolling tire\nWhat transmission did you choose?\nan MTB rear derailleur so I could go for 11 speed\nso it could be compatible with E13's 9-45 cassette\nThat range was perfect for\nflat stages and also for hard core climbs\nI rather run 1 chainring in the front and not 2. But in this opportunity, I did not use the chain guide\nand for example in one stage I saw Laurence, who won the race, struggling twice with his change\nWhat's all the stuff you have in your bike?\nMud fender, more bottles, I had 3 on my bke\n2 with electrolytes\nin the top I had a bottle cage storage with tools and spares\nand in the lower bottle, I had my gels, leg cream, butt cream\nvery important, the bottle cages need to be quite tight, in fact, my 3 bottle cages had a little rubber band\nthat ensures my bottles to stay there\nI had the rear rack from Aeroe\nit was super stable, it goes attached\nto the swingarm and it simply did not move at all\nxc pedals and a 44-width handlebar to be comfier on the descents\nWhat do you eat during the stages?\nNormally you would share with other riders, buy some bread, cheese, ham, jam, peanut butter\nand you prepare some sandwiches and find where to store them and during the ride, you eat them\nyou could also buy granola bars,\na Milkyway, snickers, some chocolate\nthe key is to keep eating, every hour, every half an hour.\nif you wait until you feel hungry\nit's game over\nhydration no matter what you will need to stop. I remember Ardila saying, let's wait for the next store\nand nothing at all, and it was extremely hot\nand both of us \"died\"\nnot even a river, a house, nothing\nbut even if you are in the lead group,\nthere were a few days that I rode with the leaders\nthere could be an agreed stop, so you will need cash to buy something and fill up your bottles\nbuy a Gatorade, buy whatever you find useful so you can carry on right away\nbuy bread, whatever! and here's where I say is so important to know how to use your hands while pedaling. It is key!\nto grab, open, peal off, chew, but fast!\nHow much time do you have to recover?\nPost-stage time is quite relative\nin the top guy's scenario, about 5 hours later they might be arriving, so at 1:30pm they were already at the finish line\nSo they had all afternoon to have lunch, take a shower, wash the bike, do a quick bike check, take a nap, buy food for the next day\ngo for dinner and sleep\nthere was a girl who finished every day around 7 or 8pm, so I assume she arrived, had dinner sleep and then pedal again the next day\nI guess she simply washed her clothes in the shower and wear them a bit damp the day after\nHow to not get lost?\nthe event provides you a .GPX file that you upload to your cycle computer and then from there you can navigate\nbut even more important is all the information that this file will give you\nit will tell you things like the length of the next climb, climb inclination\nall of this information is key to knowing what's next, where you can push, and what to do.\ni\nthat's quite important\nWhat's the weight carried?\nIt is pretty challenging to pack\n8 days of your life in a really small bag\nyou need to find a light deodorant, and a light toothpaste, every gram counts\nyou need to have your bad weather clothes easy to find\nfor example, the salt pills tend to explode\ntry to train with all the weight.\nFor example, my bike ended up in 16Kg\nHow to make sure no one cheats?\nwe are tracked at all times, we use a GPS that you turn it on before the start and then turn it off at the end\nYour family can track you in real time, and you could also be found if something bad happens\nand they could also check that you went through the right path\nthe only one that can decide if you want to cheat or not is you:\nit's up to you if you want to win by cheating\nI joined this event to experience it, to share it, and then communicate it to you and impact the people positively\nyou will find the subscription button below\nand until the next one"

      "description": "Transcordilleras is a gravel bikepacking race in Colombia that includes a non-stop, an eight-day, and a three-day format. I headed down to Medell\u00edn to do the three-day as my first-ever bikepacking race.\n\nThe mountains were enormous, the gravel was brutal, the people were generous and the food was delicious. It was an adventure!\n\nI was lucky enough to test a custom Scarab Paramo made in Retiro, Colombia that I built up with Shimano's new 12-speed mechanical GRX gravel group.\n\nWere my gears low enough? Were my 40- and 45mm tires big enough? Only one way to find out...\n\n-\nThanks to Bert for the bikepacking shoes for off the bike: https://thebertshoe.com/\n\n-\nThe Ride is supported in 2024 by:\nCastelli clothing: http://tinyurl.com/43k6pftp\nGiro helmets: http://tinyurl.com/72svzzxp\nFeedback Sports stands & tools: https://bit.ly/3S9Dq8r\nSilca maintenance: https://bit.ly/47xxvzj (save 10% with code 'theride10')\nFirst Endurance nutrition: https://bit.ly/41SDgqq (save 20% with code 'THERIDE')\nShimano shoes & glasses: http://tinyurl.com/ye274tep",

      "transcript": "what in the world is trans\n[Music]\ncordier wi from Columbia just outside of\nGranada\nwe are riding to the start of the 3-day\nversion of trans cordier there's a\nNon-Stop an 8-day and a 3-day we're\ndoing a\n3-day I'm here testing a beautiful\nColombian custom bike the Scarab Paro\nwith this gorgeous Campina paint Scheme\ngot the new Shimano 12-speed grx\nMechanical group it's got a 51 on the\nback which I'm feeling good about I\nswitched the 40 to to 44 after riding\nthese columb roads which comeing two\nflavors steep or crazy steep I'm not\nfeeling so good about that\nchoice but it's all fun of games right\nthe trans gordier format I love for my\nvery first bike packing Adventure in\nthat there are showers and beds at the\nend of each stage provided we can find\nour way to the end of said stage in\nhotel some folks can race it\nsome folks can ride to finish it I'm\nhere with my compatriot and part-time\ncameraman loganon Bo I think we're\nhalfway in between but come along for\nthe ride we'll see how we\ngo for my first big ride in Colombia we\ncommuted to the start from rtio to\nguatape where I was lucky to have the\ncompanionship of my new friends camoo\nand Juan Julian and Sebastian also we\nhad Moto support a guy fallen behind on\na scooter with a bike pump and supplies\nwhich evidently is a fairly common thing\nfor training in Columbia different kind\nof moto pacing Moto\nsupport what up cows\nhow you\nliving stage one was an 86 mile 11,000\nft Affair from guatape to fonia good\nmorning start of stage\none Natalia what are we what are we in\nfor what are we doing today I don't know\nman we're crazy so it's like 95 miles\n140k 140k almost 3,000 and something\nmeters of climbing but the views are\nnice people are happy and do this what's\nyour one piece of advice for new newbies\nlike\nme um enjoy the views don't look down\nthere's so much to see and just enjoy\nthe\npain you snuck that last one in there\nI'll enjoy the views\nokay into it the St\nclimb six miles\n10% uh\noh I opted not to take my usuu pack like\nI normally do for gravel races figuring\nI've never been in Columbia in my life I\nshould take advantage of the stops the\nstops were quick though F1 style in the\ntendas we came racing into rero grabbed\na bunch of waters and we're off come out\nof the shop and old man holding my bike\nfor me getting it ready to\ngo nice folks here in\nthe well the folks at Hy aren't so nice\nthey ain't\nwaiting dudes are jerks up\nthere we were racing through\nconstruction zones with barely even\nslowing down just whoever was at the\nfront would yell out hey we're in a\nrace and we'd go blasting through we're\nout in it\nnow these Des are so rough I've never\nbeen so happy in my life to start a\nclimb this at the end of these\nback pinching arm shaking shoulder\ncrunching Rowdy old desense but look at\nthese\nviews aside from my huffing and puffing\nso quiet out here stage one in the 3-day\naffair Was Won by Jorge Garcia a\nphysicist and a guy who flies up the\nhills stage two went from fonia to Hero\nour hotel was at the bottom of a Long\nHill so Santiago Toro the founder of\nScarab Cycles devised a shuttle for us\ncommute to stage\ntwo the Colombian way Colombian\nway\nunlike most stage races where a Leader's\nJersey designates who's in the general\nclassification lead at trans cordier the\nleader gets a stuffy to carry with him\nit's going to be a rough\nride hold on little\nfoxy Nicholas Serrano one of the four\nguys who started the very first trans\ncordier took the win in our 3D division\non stage\ntwo we're at the Finish town for stage\ntwo came second today again I second on\nstage one today was a totally different\nday it was only quote quote only 45\nmiles but there was 7500 ft of climbing\nit's crazy there was so much descending\nmy arms were getting fatigued even on\nthe pavement like descending out of the\nstart town I was getting fatigu from\ndescending that is never happened to me\ntell you a bit about stage one first so\nthat was 6 and 1 half hours it's one of\nthose days where looking at the computer\ndoesn't really tell the story like you\ncan get the stats in your shirt like\naverage power and TSS and all that's\nfine and good but just\nabsorb being the rough roads for hours\ndefinitely took a toll I was good and\ncracked yesterday bike talk I'm on a\nsteel bike steel Scarab I haven't ridden\na lot of Steel in the last oh two\ndecades definitely appreciate having a\nlittle bit more absorption than say an\nalloy bike and with rocks Ki kicking up\nyou know probably a little more peace of\nmind than a carbon bike yeah it's a bit\nheavier but as you can see I'm lugging\nthe kitchen sink um so the way to the\nframe is not something I've thought\nabout yesterday I went a little too\nlight on\nwater looking at the map thinking oh\nwe're only have 10K to go and uh nearly\ncame to grief had to hide in the shade\nfor a while in order to get going again\nuh so today when I saw a store I got SAS\nand drank two wore two on myself and\nthen shared one with Nicholas who took\nthe stage today nice work on\nthat things I would\nchange I hate to say this it hurts my\ndelicate Pride I if I was to come again\nI might try the red shift stem something\nthat offends my delicate Ro\nsensibilities just because it's it's\nhard to convey like I'm going to be\nshowing a lot of b-roll from the ride\nbut I feel the way about the video of\nColumbia gravel that I do about uh\ncobbles in Belgium and France and it\nlooks very quaint in photos and you\ncan't really convey how bone jarring\neyeball shap\nit is but trust me it's it's rough very\nrough always a kick at the end it's\nkicking but dig the houses huh the\namount of color is crazy like I got to\npick the paint Scheme on this it's all\nmucked up with mud now but I'll show a\ncleaner picture this is the\nCampina scheme and it was so cool to\nsee that all over uh one neat thing\nabout this race is it takes you on tiny\nlittle roads so you're able to see a lot\nmore than you would if you were on a\ntour bus or you were driving around I\nmean that would be a cool experience I'm\nsure also but just being like what feels\nto me like way out in the country and\nseeing uh people and cattle and dogs and\nuh full local flare has been uh quite a\ntreat for\nme trans gordas again cannot encapsulate\nit into just a few words hey puppy hey\npuppy do I love the fact that there are\nPerros just seemingly everywhere and\nthey're all they're all friendly pups\nit's can be a little sketchy on Des\nsense when they're just chilling in the\nroad but generally it's\nnice seeing dogos out\neverywhere I can't encapsulate trans\ngorier into one word but I can highly\nrecommend coming to Columbia if you're\nin the bikes and experience it in some\nsomeway shape or form it's been\nfantastic and we'll wrap it up tomorrow\nwith a ride into Santa\nFe oh here's it\nyeah\nstage three was only 45 miles but\nstarted with a\nscreaming 6,000 ft\ndescent today's stage stage three was my\ntype of\nstage we descended I don't know 7,000 ft\nand climbed maybe two or 3,000 uh it was\nall paved we're cooking along uh heading\nalong the river for most of the time\ntime The Descent was neutralized which I\nwas grateful for because even taking it\ntranquilo it was pretty sketch you know\nlike negative 20\u00b0\ngrades got the fox last night uh as por\nunfortunately got sick at the end of the\nstage and had to drop out sorry about\nthat Jorge um was able to defend today\nit was a Sprint finish didn't know where\nthe Finish was is you know bike racing\nbut uh I was able to get that and happy\nto go home with the little Soro stuffy\nwith the Trans gordier logo on his\nnose I don't know if you can hear people\ncoming across the finish line here the\natmosphere this of this traveling\ncircus is a treat is both a three dayers\nlike myself and the eight dayers all\nfinishing up here Lauren's tnd Dam has\nbeen hanging out since he finished days\nago all 1,000 km so what does one pack\nfor a bike packing race I have no idea I\nwas just kind of winging it talking to\nsome of my buddies but this is what I\nbrought so we've got two or Le packs got\na 4 L frame pack and then an 11 L seat\nbag uh which was like fairly secure it's\nkind of funny doing a Sprint with a\nbunch of weight and a fox stuffy dancing\naround behind there so what are we have\nhere I\nput and this guy Electronics\nbeing charger for the phone charger for\nthe camera that Logan is holding and\nshooting on charger for the uh Rome\ncharger for the DJI\nEtc and then yeah toilet trees in\nanother\nbag saddle bag which was just like\nnormal fixings right\nuh couple you know just like this is the\nstuff I would take for a normal one day\ngrab\nrace Dino\nplugs two cartridges a little thing of\nlube multi-tool and two little\ntubitos and a lever so just the basics\nthere so that was that and then the\ntransponder that was in this bag also\nstarted out with some first endurance\nmix which is you know 400 calories per\nbottle I measured out enough to have six\nbottles so I'd start each day with two\nfull bottles I would buy a I don't know\nwhat size of 500 M thing of electri chug\nthat right before the start put another\none in the Jersey pocket so I'd have at\nleast four to start with and then we'd\nstop at stores and get a bunch\nmore so luckily these ortley bags come\nwith foxy securing straps should you\nfind yourself you know in Columbia doing\na race where you need to carry a stuffy\nwith you a lot of guys would put their\nshoes or sandals\nin this up top strap I put a little\nblinky on the back these bags are\nwaterproof\nwhich you know this whole\nthing comes off at the end of the stages\nout often just like take this whole\nthing up to the room so this\nguy I mean you could put quite a bit\nmore in\nthere you know what this was an extra\nkit that I washed\nat the end of the\nstage close for hanging out in\nafterwards which is what I'll change\ninto\nnow Bird shoes for cruising\naround and then a couple things just in\ncase gloves I don't like wearing gloves\nI didn't use these at all but I thought\nmy hands might get waxed and so these\nwere a just in case thing and then\nanother just in case\nthing rain jacket which a lot of the\nguys were using in the mornings or in\nthe evenings like as a sweatshirt\nbecause it was cold here Columbia cold I\ndon't know 60\u00b0 but yeah these two things\njust stayed buried in here and I didn't\nneed to use those so that is what I put\nin my bags for first ever trans\ncordier\nthanks for meeting\nthe you\ncan\n[Applause]\nnow I'm back home\nin Colorado missing Columbia already the\ngear was just enough having a 44 ring\nwith shimano's new\ngrx giant cassette that goes up to a 51\nwas just enough if I had gone with their\nrace cassette or shrams race cassette\nthat you know the 1044 is range that\nwould have been nowhere near enough I\nwas grinding on this on some of those 20\nplus Steeps and then I was using the\n4410 to Sprint for the wi at the end so\nLessons Learned From Me riding in\nColumbia big gears is a good thing big\ntires is a good thing you know having a\n45 Rambler up front uh and you know\ncould have gone with something more than\nthe 40 Reaver I had in the back I could\nmake this video 45 minutes long with all\nthe stories I brought out of that event\nbut try to keep it wrapped up and TIY if\nyou got any questions uh put them below\nI'll be doing more videos you know on\nthe bike I did a tour of the Scarab\nFactory where this bike was you know\ncustom built and painted I'll be talking\nmore about Shimano grx and if you give\nme half a chance you catch me on a ride\nI will talk your ear off about how\namazing Columbia is as a place to ride a\nlot of folks ask so you going to come\nback and do the 8 day I was like well\nfriends I talked to were pretty\ncracked doing the 8 day I'm Keen to get\nback and ride more I'm super excited to\ncome back and do this event again as the\n3-day maybe the 8 day but definitely\nwant to spend more time riding bikes in\nColumbia and that is what I hope I can\nleave you with is that if you are into\nriding bikes get yourself to Columbia\nyou will have a hard time doing anything\nbut enjoying the\nride"
