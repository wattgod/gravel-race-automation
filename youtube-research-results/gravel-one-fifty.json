      "description": "Again a large and strong starting field. Early present so was further ahead than usual. The first kilometers went very fast while it moved fairly quickly on unpaved paths.\n\nThe first 15km well from the front and drove very fast with an average speed of almost 40km/h despite the narrow bridge at km 7.5. Then I was in the second group a little less hard but still hard! Up to +- km 40 it went great (36+ km/h average) and was still nice and far ahead. Unfortunately, at this point there was a wasp flying into my helmet that I couldn't get out quickly and also stung me.\n\nAt the first feeding stop at km 70 but stopped for a while because I soon got a fierce sting and a burning sensation. I was getting more and more dizzy. Cool down and stop your legs and then try to continue on the road. Direct gas on it because had a nice group for this. Drove back but the tank hit army and army.\n\nThe best was from after km 110. Still by fighting another bottle filled at the last feeding post because despite my camelback and water bottles icm the heat too little moisture... I came to sit alone but still drove back a bit after the group. Pressed out another sprint and crossed the line after 4h 39m 18s.\n\n#inmyelemnt #instacyclingcommunity #lifebehindbars #iamsiroko #orbea #pov #rideinstyle #ridewithme #ucigravelworldseries #qualifier #gravelonefifty",
