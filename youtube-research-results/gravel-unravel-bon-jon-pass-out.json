      "transcript": "well folks it's high time i showed you\nanother one of my adventures\nthis route is a loop of my own creation\nthat begins and ends in quilsine\nwashington\nit's pretty tough with 10 000 feet of\nclimbing in its 80 mile distance and\n5400 feet in the first day alone\nbut it rewards you with mountain views\nsweet ribbons of seldom use single track\nand shelters along the way that you can\ncamp in\nthis trip was my third time venturing\nout in this area but only my second time\nriding the completed route\nwelcome to the bonjon singletrack loop\n[Music]\nover here is where the road splits\ni'm going right and in two days time\ni'll be coming back\non the left side\nwell started what will be probably\nfive miles of climbing it's been kind of\nhard\noh man\nnearly at the top of this thing but i\nthink i forgot how big these climbs are\nit's crazy\nand i'm about to lose all the elevation\nor almost all of it\nand i have to do it again for camp\nreally missed my turn\nso\ncheck it out you can see mount baker\njust made it to the top of the climb it\nwas way more than i was expecting\nit's funny how you forget how hard\nthings are but uh\njust about to drop into the three\no'clock ridge trail and it was pretty\ndusty on the way up\ngood thing i had this mask turns out i\nbrought it for two reasons\nso that was pretty nice\ntrying to do some filming on the way\ndown but\ni'm ready to be done\ngood morning i slept for 10 hours last\nnight\nwell the last shot you will have seen\nwith me was when i was just getting onto\nthe trail\nit goes down the hillside but i spent so\nmany hours climbing\nunfortunately the gopro does it lets you\nthink every now and then it just stopped\nworking\nso all the lovely bar cam janky jenkins\njanky\nthat was lost it didn't matter anyway\nbecause it was getting so dark\nuh the camera wouldn't have been able to\nsee anything unfortunate\ni wish i would have left earlier in the\nday actually that made it better\nso i ended up camping at this really\ncool shelter\nit's called camp ron apparently a family\nrebuilt it in 1985 and they keep coming\nback here\nbecause it reminds me of their\ngrandfather who passed in the last five\nyears\nthere's like a little log book\nyou can like hear about stories your\nreaders stories as you\nfall asleep it's pretty cool and it's\nright next to the river\ni took my time packing up and then\nheaded up river on the lower dungeness\ntrail\nthis is a beautiful trail where it\nexists but it's been the victim of\nseveral bad washouts on years of neglect\nthe route drops into the dungeness\nvalley where it does in order to avoid\nthe worst of the washouts further\ndownstream\nafter the trail and a short steep gravel\nclimb you come to a parking lot for the\ngold creek and tuplecan trail systems\nall the cars in the parking lot might\nmake you worried about congestion on the\ntrail but actually most of the hikers go\nup the tubal cane trail\ninto the buckhorn wilderness i didn't\nsee anyone on the gold creek trail this\nday\nthis is such a cool trail it's so smooth\nand uh trends slightly downhill\nso just sit there and cruise along so\ngreat\nstarting to open up on the side you can\nsee some views\npretty sweet definitely worth the road\nclimb\nafter the gold creek trail you turn\nright onto the sleepy hollow trail\nit's an old road grade that takes you\nover to the mount zion parking lot\ni brought my saw for this trip mostly\nbecause there were a lot of overgrown\nsections along here last time\nbut i was surprised to find out that it\nhad been cleared pretty recently\nthe only thing i had to contend with was\ntall grass and swarms of gnats\na head hike from miles well quick update\ni finished the trails i'm headed towards\nmount zion\nbut i'll be on fire roads ran through a\ncrap ton of tall grass\ni've got uh quite a lot of seeds on my\nsocks\nbut i'm in good spirits and i'm feeling\na lot better than i remember feeling at\nthis point last time i did this\nthat bodes well for the mondo climb i\nhave ahead of me\nso i'm at the top of mountain zion\ntrailhead i'm like i'm gonna go up\ni've always been curious to go up but\ni've never had the energy once i'm here\nso right now i'm going to do\npretty awesome downhill and then\ni was looking at the trail data it's not\nthe longest climb\nit just takes you the highest\nso hopefully there's some good views\nit's kind of cloudy today so\nthey keep rolling in and out so we'll\nsee what we can see up there\nthe mount zion trail is open to bikes\nbut as i said i've never had the energy\nfor another mile and a half of climbing\nonce i reach the trailhead\nif you come in the spring this is a\ngreat area to see the rhododendrons but\nwater's not available unless it's been\nreally wet\nso camel up on gold creek beforehand\nafter a quick two mile descent\ni climbed up towards bonjon pass the\nlast major climb on the route\nhell made it to the top wasn't that bad\njust it wasn't so cloudy heading to camp\nnow\nhopefully it's not too buggy there um\nhere i am at the sink lake shelter\nspent the night here um\ni had a pretty good sleep just kind of\npitched my\ndidn't pitch anything put my pad on the\nground over there\nslipped underneath the roof the roof is\nkind of sketchy\ndefinitely in worse shape than the uh\nriver camp\nuh from last night but uh\ni had a good campfire so that made the\nlonger and more pleasant\num it's a really cool forest in here\ni love how open the ground is\nand how tall the canopy is it feels like\na cathedral um\nso it's kind of a cool place to come\neven though the shelter and the stream\nare not as primo as um\nriver camp on the dungeness so today my\nitinerary is just to head down\num the forest road it's paved\nbut it's really fast downhill so it\nshould be fun\nwhen i have a small climb and then i'm\ndoing some of what i think is the\nsweetest\nriverside single track close to seattle\nso it's like 20 miles to get home but\nmost of it is\ndownhill so it's gonna be pretty quick\nand then it's uh that's it that's\nthat's the trip so\nhope you enjoyed it\nall right so i'm on the lower big\nquilsing trail it is awesome\nsun is shining and it's super fun and\nsuper pretty\ni mean these camp sites that are right\nnext to the river\ni'd love to come here and camp one time\nbut then i have to bring a tent\nthat would weigh me down a little more\nso we'll see but it's a really cool spot\ngot a lot more buff single track to go\nand uh such a nice way to end this\nlittle trip\njust because it's so pretty and smooth\nand effortless so i'm gonna keep riding\nall right we are out only have this\nshort little quarter mile climb and that\nis a\nabsolutely blasting downhill to get back\nto the car\ntime is 112.\ni figure i'll make it back to the car by\n1 30.\ni'll tell you when i get there\nyou"

      "description": "My second official gravel bike ride of the year was in Forks, WA.  Quite different from the previous one in Ephrata which was a bunch of open spaces with consistent climbs (which were mostly on the road, by the way).  Whereas that one was farm lands for miles, this one was in the forest with views of trees for miles.  For me, it was the hardest effort in a while.  Although we only did what was officially billed as 26 miles (turned out to be 32) and supposedly 3,000 feet of climbing (which turned out to be around 3,800), this was undoubtedly a sufferfest.  To get that much elevation over a short distance meant climbs of 15 - 20% for extended periods over loose gravel fire roads, with the occasional muddy stretch.  Yes, we enjoyed being outdoors and the camaraderie among riders was cool.  Weather was perfect (forecasted rain but it quickly changed to dry, cloudy with sunbreaks - we averaged high 40's to low 50's, which was perfect climbing weather).  I'm not sure if I'm signing up for something like that again, though.\nI trained specifically for this event for just around 6 weeks - even replaced my whole drivetrain to get that really low gearing for those steep climbs.  Was it worth it?  Well, Y.O.L.O., right?  \nEvery new piece of equipment worked fantastic...Shimano GRX 2-11 (42T)all the way, except for that GoPro mount which snapped (more in the video).  Two of them, too....\n\nHere's more info on the ride series in case you're interested in participating in the second or third one.  I'm probably not going...\nhttps://peninsulaadventuresports.com/events/quilcene-gravel-unravel/",
