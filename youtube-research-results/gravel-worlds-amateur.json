      "transcript": "[Music]\nthis is the outskirts of Lincoln\nNebraska home to cornfields hills heat\nand the unofficial world championships\nof gravel gravel worlds if someone says\nto you oh isn't Nebraska flat well that\nwould be a big negative because the\nentire 150 mile course has about 11,000\nfeet of climbing\nit's very lumpy indeed it's six o'clock\non Saturday morning central USA time and\nwe're about to embark on a 150 mile\nadventure we start off on the neutral\nbut the pace isn't that neutral holding\nsomewhere around 25 miles an hour or 40\nkilometers an hour if you're metric like\nme\nand here we go on to the first of many\ngravel roads in these scenes I'm on the\ntail end of the front bunch but it\ndidn't take long for their rapido pace\nto greatly displeased my legs and I was\nout the back and chugging along all\nalone but the good news is I rode some\nof the early miles with Christy mone one\nof the promoters of the dirty cans of\ngravel race Christy nos swap turns until\nshe dropped me somewhere along one of\ntheir many hills of this course\nincidentally I understand there were 87\nhills along B for 150 mile or 240\nkilometer course that's a wee bit\nunpleasant when you make your home in\nNorth Central Florida for most of the\nyear which isn't renowned being all that\nhilly but there are plenty of down hills\nto peddle flat-out\nso it's sort of equalizers the roads are\nin primo shape for much of the course\nbut there are many sections of the\ngravel which put some riders into\ndifficulty you need to be very relaxed\nand allow the bike to float especially\nif you start slipping and sliding around\nin the deep gravel or any kind of\nsketchy Road for that matter\nin addition to open roads and skies the\ngravel world's course features plenty of\nlong and straight roads that can wreak\ncutter havoc if the wind is blowing a\ngale on race day the winds were almost\nnon-existent which is rare for this part\nof the world this is the small town of\nTUI home to the first oasis along the\ncourse i refueled here with gatorade\nwhich is known to mess my Stein so if\nyou want to read more of my gory details\nbehind this race check out my racer port\nwhich is linked below the video for\nthose who aren't aware like most couple\nraces gravel world's requires riders to\nbe a source efficient that means no\noutside support from friends or family\nyou have to carry your own food and\nhydration with options to refuel along\nthe course at the two official\ncheckpoints Oasis or convenience stores\nthis is the town of Roma and on the\nright is the alignment tavern for those\nwondering about the wheelset\nI'm writing it happens to be the Zenta\nScapa to 650b\ncarbon four-spoke will set I have a\nreview coming soon\none of the rare times our companions\nduring the race in this shot is Nick\nRegan the author of the book gravel\ncycling\nnext town on the menu is Valparaiso and\nthis is Valparaiso from the air\nthis is one of two mandatory checkpoints\nand where I ran into Jim Phillips the\nbard of gravel cycling to see the rest\nof his gravel world's masterpiece look\nfor it in the link below this video\nafter the checkpoint arrived with this\ngroup of lads on and off working\ntogether as best we could\nhere I'm pulling into another Oasis and\nI ran into Jim knocking out yet another\nverse of his poem for the next leg Jim\nand I rode together on and off meeting\nagain in the town of Malcolm Nebraska\nwe spent a bit of time hanging out front\nof the Malcolm general store after\nbuying supplies\nthis is Malcolm from above note that the\nmain road through town is dirt and\ngravel the anchors aren't bored in the\ntables are stored I'm getting tired a\nlot after Malcolm I wrote on and off\nwith Jim and Megan otherwise known as\nthe cyclists lawyer megan is a badass\nsingle speed rider who ultimately took\nsecond in the woman's a single speed\ncategory on the right is the world's\nlargest covered wagon but admittedly it\nis a little bit underwhelming time for\nanother stall stop 101 miles into the\ncourse noticed a huge pile of empty\nbottles from cyclists in the trash can\nabout 27 miles while 43 kilometers\nremained until the next checkpoint this\nwas a tough section of course close to\nthe town of Denton Nebraska\nsadly I did not film the dental wall\nwhich is likely the steepest hill along\nthe entire course and here we have\nDenton Nebraska\nmore chunky loose gravel and finally\ncheckpoint number two\njust twenty two miles or about 35\nkilometers left to ride in this scene\nfive miles to go this was a long hot\ntough day in the saddle the hills have\ndone a serious number on my legs\nthe final sector of gravel back onto\npavement and back to the start/finish\nline in Fallbrook an area of Lincoln\nNebraska nearing the finish line my time\nwasn't super fast but I was happy to\nfinish especially considering how I felt\nin the final three hours of this race\nKorey the tall that on the left is one\nof the founders of the gravel world's\nrace\nthank you for watching if you haven't\nalready please subscribe to the gravel\ncyclist YouTube channel I'll see you in\nthe

      "transcript": "got Grand Prix champions. We've got\nnational champions.\n&gt;&gt; I'm calling it right now. It's going to\nbe one of the best finishes in gravel\nbike race history.\n&gt;&gt; In my opinion, it's actually harder than\nUnbound.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's 50 mi less, but I think the\nterrain is just a little more\nrelentless.\nterms of technical difficulty, it's a\nlittle bit easier. But one thing I\nquickly learned last year is there's no\nflat roads in Nebraska.\n[Music]\n&gt;&gt; Any fast guys coming up behind me?\n&gt;&gt; Not at the moment.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, that's excellent. Thank you.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nfrom Omaha, Nebraska.\n&gt;&gt; It's two weeks after Leadville. Now it's\nback on the gravel bike. Today, Carrie\nand I are headed east to the land of\ncorn fields. Um, this weekend is Gravel\nWorlds Nebraska. This will be my second\ntime doing the event, but this year I\nthink there's just going to be a much\nbigger uh stacked field due to the large\nprize purse and being a part of the\nGraler series.\nAll the tire choices for the weekend.\nIt looks very nice and organized.\n&gt;&gt; Which one you think you'll use?\n&gt;&gt; Probably the Teras 45. These guys.\n&gt;&gt; Yep. Got the snacks.\n&gt;&gt; Next stop, Nebraska.\nI think one of the things that'll be a\nbit surprising about the weekend is just\nhow stacked the field is. Part of the\nGravel Earth series and it's one of the\nhigher level races within that series.\nUm the $100,000 prize purse also draws a\nlot of riders. I think in North America,\nnot as many people are chasing the\nGraler series, but um with a prize purse\nlike that, I think we'll see a lot more\nNorth American riders than we\nhistorically do at this Gravel Worlds\nevent. amn\nWho is it?\n&gt;&gt; It's Britney,\n&gt;&gt; That's not Britney, dude.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, it's Miley.\nEven better,\n&gt;&gt; Cyrus.\n&gt;&gt; Let's go.\n&gt;&gt; Ain't going to play itself.\n&gt;&gt; This is as slow as it goes. I like it.\nThis is the next\nhard style.\n&gt;&gt; I like it.\n&gt;&gt; High car this ride.\n&gt;&gt; Of course.\n300 gallons an hour.\nLittle opener action for the race.\nRussell's talking like this is going to\nbe harder than Unbound. Do you feel that\nway?\n&gt;&gt; Is race?\n&gt;&gt; Nah, I didn't race in her last year, so\nI feel like I won't forget.\n&gt;&gt; Only time will tell.\n&gt;&gt; Toby says no.\n&gt;&gt; Up and down roller coasters all day and\nthe roller coaster hills kind of like\nslowly ramp up. So you lose a lot of\nspeed over the top and then you have to\naccelerate down. So it's just kind of\nthis um surfing the terrain a little bit\nthat uh zaps your legs. Lots of\ncrosswinds, echelons. I think the race\njust throws everything at you.\nAnother unique thing about the race this\nweekend is there's no outside support,\nwhich means we're on our own should we\nflat, break a chain, anything like that.\nOn the nutrition side of things, we have\nto be self-sufficient out there. Some\npeople choose to go the whole distance\nwithout stopping and carrying all the\nwater for the day. Or there's two maybe\nthree uh water oasises where you can\nstop, fill your bottle. Definitely a\nlittle bit more strategy around\nnutrition and feed zone stops this\nweekend compared to your average gravel\nrace, which is kind of cool. Just adds\nanother dynamic to the weekend.\nNo stopping tomorrow. All the water for\nthe whole day. So, I'm going to try to\ngo the 7 hours with no water.\n&gt;&gt; What is that? What does that mean?\n&gt;&gt; I'm going to bring like 6 L of water.\n&gt;&gt; 2 lb per liter.\n&gt;&gt; So, about\n&gt;&gt; plus carb mix.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, true. Can't discount that.\n&gt;&gt; Carbs. More carbs. No, let's not talk\nabout carbs.\n&gt;&gt; Wait till you see how much.\n&gt;&gt; No,\nyou dude. You can't drink that.\n&gt;&gt; That's what's going in the packet.\nAll right, so let's go. Bottle test. Boa\nstrap. See, James\ndoesn't matter to you. No support\ntomorrow.\n&gt;&gt; Like I still get breakfast.\n&gt;&gt; What's your plan?\n&gt;&gt; Uh\nIHOP.\n&gt;&gt; What do you think about the disc wheel\nfor gravel?\n&gt;&gt; I don't know. I've never never messed\naround with one, but John sure made it\nlook fast. So, I mean, we're we're\ncoming full circle, so I almost feel\nlike there's something to it. It's good\nenough clearance, don't you think?\nNot expecting mud.\nYou're going to feel like your bike\npack.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. You lost for it.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. There's a lot of a lot of\ndifferent tactics at play. A lot of\ndifferent rules.\n&gt;&gt; No outside support. No team tactics.\nGot to stop at the stop signs.\n&gt;&gt; What else is there? Oh, there's a yellow\nline rule. Virtual yellow line.\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n&gt;&gt; I mean, I get the safety of it, but I\ndon't see how that's going to go.\nThat's hot.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm done in here.\n&gt;&gt; Should we start making dinner?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but I really just want to make\nsure you had a good birthday, Mom.\n&gt;&gt; Wouldn't be doing this without your mom.\n&gt;&gt; If I don't make it, can you come get me?\n&gt;&gt; If you post that on YouTube, it's like\n70 chicks and there's the end. It's\nlike,\n&gt;&gt; oh,\n&gt;&gt; he's a bomb. He's full of\n&gt;&gt; So,\n&gt;&gt; what's the deal with that rear wheel you\ngot going on?\n&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. Well, I just thought it looked\nfast. So, yeah. I've been trying it and\nit's really hard to tell how fast it is,\nbut maybe it's faster. That's what the\nAero Bros say. Yeah. I'd say the bike\ntracks like straighter. Like, it feels\nlike if you were to take a samurai sword\nand cut it. You know what I'm saying?\nknife,\n&gt;&gt; dude. It just cuts through gravel like a\nknife through water.\n&gt;&gt; Frisbee golf throwing a Frisbee to the\nbasket and then think about me rolling\nover those Nebraska like rollers\n&gt;&gt; like a vertical frisbee.\n&gt;&gt; Yes. Tron Legacy.\nWe've been running for so long. Is there\na to\n[Applause]\nshades of gray?\nOnly standing on the just a shadow.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, it's for spackle drywall,\n&gt;&gt; but it's for the mud today.\n&gt;&gt; 151.8 8 miles 10,000 ft of elevation\ngain.

Trying to kill before I\ncome.\nI can tell.\nI can feel it in my heart.\nMe trying to feel before I come on. But\nit's just a part of me I can't get away\nfrom\nhis composure.

Got the training in.\n&gt;&gt; Did you ever stop?\n&gt;&gt; I did at the very end cuz my whole group\nstopped and I was like, \"Coke sounds\nnice.\" So, I grabbed uh two Cokes.\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n&gt;&gt; I drank one and then I was like,\n\"Someone will want a Coke eventually.\"\nAnd then we came across Tobin and Tobin\nwanted a Coke.\n&gt;&gt; You gave Tobin a Coke?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n&gt;&gt; dude.\n&gt;&gt; He gave me a lead out at the end.\n&gt;&gt; Nicest guy in the Pelaton award.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, I'll take that.

I mean, it's a national\nchampionship.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Stars and stripes, baby.\n&gt;&gt; If you win, you have to defend.\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. That's how it works. Harry's up\nnext.\n&gt;&gt; See you guys\n&gt;&gt; later.\nAll right, we're going to be a\ntriathlete for the day. Let's go, Scuba\nSteve. Today we're doing my first\ntriathlon. I'm trying to win this thing\ncuz it's the gravel triathlon national\nchampionships. So, if I can get the dub,\ncan do first and last and call it a\ncareer. We've got 0.9 mile swim, 27 mile\nbike, 6.2 mile run. We got a rainbow.\nBeautiful morning. Swimming is my\nweakness. So, would you say the bike is\nyour strength?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I would say so. Me, too. I think\nso, dude. Actually, for real though, you\ngot to get my um bike mount because\ndude, I'm going to go full\n&gt;&gt; You going to do cycle cross?\n&gt;&gt; Full cycle cross. I'm going to put 10\nseconds into people.\n&gt;&gt; It's game on.\ncomes to a brand new generation.\nYou don't know.\n&gt;&gt; That's so scary.\nSo reputation\nmake you feel so\nyou still\ndown and out. Now I can't keep my voice\nover. That ain't what it's about. Still\nhave so much left to know.\nCongratulations.\nNo,\nthey try to do it like me, but they do\nit all.\nCongratulations to every\nThat guy's gone.\nfrom Witch, Kansas.\n&gt;&gt; I forgot to drop these.\n&gt;&gt; I think just one guy ahead of you.\n&gt;&gt; There's two. Never mind.\n&gt;&gt; Run him down, boy.\n&gt;&gt; Dude, I'm doing 615 mile.\n&gt;&gt; Huh?\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing like a 6 minute mile.\nWell, go faster.\n&gt;&gt; All right. Hey, bike\n&gt;&gt; downhill. Go get them, Tiger.\n&gt;&gt; Finish them,\n&gt;&gt; dude. Homie and Red Falling Heart. Run\nhim down.\nI believe this is not one of our\nstandard distance.\n&gt;&gt; Dude, what was it like filming today?\n&gt;&gt; It was a lot easier, less stressful. I\nliked it. It's just cool. You can watch\nthe race unfold and then just jump\nacross to the next group at like 90 mph,\nwait for you to catch up.\n&gt;&gt; I definitely would rather watch the\ngravel race unfold from the 690 than\nfrom the Envy Mog.\n&gt;&gt; This is it. The live timing.\n&gt;&gt; First place.\n&gt;&gt; First place in my category. Second place\noverall.\n&gt;&gt; Second overall.\n&gt;&gt; Dang,\n&gt;&gt; dude. You're talking to a a goddamn\nnational champion right now. How does\nthat feel?\n&gt;&gt; Just proud of you for not\nyourself.\n&gt;&gt; How did the swim go? You came out pretty\nfar back.\n&gt;&gt; Really? Yeah,\n&gt;&gt; dude. I swallowed a lot of water in the\nswim. It was hard to sight like see\nwhere you were gone. Couple times I\nwould like get swim in a couple strokes\nand then I'd look up and I'd be heading\nin this direction. Dude, my favorite\npart about the swim was the fact that\nyou could walk in for like a quarter\nmile.\n&gt;&gt; Car wheel. Car wheel.\nNice. Way to go, Carrie."
