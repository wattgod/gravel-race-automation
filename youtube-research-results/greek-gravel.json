      "transcript": "I get the most joy out of travel when I\ntravel by bike it's a lot of fun to be\nout in the sun getting exercise while\nalso sightseeing and experiencing new\ncultures but it's more than just fun it\nfeels liberating in a certain kind of\nway there's a sort of freedom in knowing\nthat you can travel around the world or\nat least a small part of the world if\nyour trip is shorter just by the\nstrength of your own 2 feet last summer\nthree of us took a trip to Greece to\nexercise some of that freedom and find a\nlittle Adventure along the way\n[Music]\nsoly my friends Bobby and atalie who I\ntoured Southern Portugal with last year\njoined me again this time on the other\nside of Europe we met up in the capital\nAthens with our bikes one of the only\nparts of the trip we planned ahead of\ntime we felt like we established a good\nkind of Rhythm last time and didn't\nthink it was important to make too many\ndecisions and commitments from across\nthe ocean I know it stresses some people\nout but I find it freeing not to have to\ndecide where I'm staying or which way\nI'm going until the last minute\nbasically when I'm Already There Greece\nbeing a hugely popular tourist\ndestination had had no shortage of\nplaces to stay in great itineraries so\nwe did some research ahead of time but\nleft most of the decision- making till\nthe end there was a heatwave drought and\nWildfire situation in the country around\nthe time of our arrival which influenced\nsome of our decisions as well in Athens\nwe explored some museums and put our\nbikes together in preparation to depart\nthe direction was finally Chosen and we\nset out South towards the port of peras\nriding out of Athens was like riding out\nof most big cities a little irritating\nbut there are a few dedicated lanes that\nmade it a little more pleasant even\nthough we had to climb some stairs once\nor twice a little further along the way\nwe met some Curious friendly locals who\ninformed us that we just climbed the\nsecond tallest hill in\nParas there was a significant Haze in\nthe air from recent wildfires and it was\noppressively hot we rode past the huge\nPort Town to a smaller one called Pama\nand took a short ferry ride to the\nisland of\nsalamina the ferry was the kind you\ncould drive a car onto and it had\nmultiple decks we were on the lower deck\nwith all the\ncars I was just trying to tr\nview as soon as we got off the boat the\ndense urban sprawl was replaced with\nquiet country living after riding over a\nsmall hill we found ourselves riding\nalong a Cove with sandy beaches we\ncouldn't help ourselves and went right\nin the water without even changing out\nof our cycling clothes it was a great\nrelief from the heat just a bit further\nalong the bay we had our first run in\nwith the trips arch nemesis but more on\nthat later when we reached the opposite\nend of salamina we took an even shorter\nfery ride back to the Mainland the moon\nhad just come up and we only had a few\nhours of daylight so we started thinking\nabout where to stay we knew there'd be a\nsmall hotel in nearby mea so we booked\nit for the night and headed in that\ndirection we took the scenic route along\nthe coast and passed a Charming little\nMarina in a town called Pachi it was\ngetting late and I thought maybe we\ncould stay here for the night our mea\nreservation came with no cancellation\nfee so we traded it for a small BNB\napartment I spotted on a tiny ad on the\nside of a building in town we had our\nfirst dinner of the trip along the water\nwith a bunch of cats running between\nbetween our feet and you can say we\nseverely underestimated the portion\nsizes the next day our journey took us\nfurther west towards ancient Corinth we\ncrossed a small Canal separating the\nmainland from pelones a large Peninsula\nSL Island that we'll be spending the\nrest of our trip on WE sped past the\ncanal and spent a significant portion of\nthe rest of the day riding along the\ncoast we stopped at a tiny beach again\nto cool off it was completely empty\nexcept for one fisherman part of the\nreason we chose this route was to be\nclose to the water and be able to jump B\nwhenever we wanted we were happy to\nindulge at lunch I finally got some\nfresh grilled sardines that I was\ndesperately searching all around\nPortugal for last year and couldn't find\nshared a little with this\nguy as we got closer to our destination\nwe began to see this giant Hill in the\ndistance it was kind of magical looking\nin the residual Haze and Setting Sun it\nturned out to be the hill the Acropolis\nof Corinth was built on and there are\nruins up there to go and explore\nfortunately we didn't have to climb the\nhill as the town of was situated right\nnext to it with its own set of\nimpressive ruins as I took photos of the\nmoon rising over the Temple of Apollo I\nnoticed people entering the site after\nhours it turned out there was an open\nair Opera being performed free to the\npublic in probably the most remarkable\nsetting you could possibly\nimagine if I wasn't starving from riding\nall day I'd probably stay longer even\nthough Opera isn't really my preferred\ngenre in the morning we went to explore\nAcro Corin after a second daytime visit\nto the main ruins in town we took a cab\nup the hill which had some pretty\nremarkable\nviews\nn\nall the exploring made it difficult to\nget a whole day of riding in though\nBobby did decide to ride back to the\ncanal and come back we decided to stay\nin Corinth another night before heading\nout further along the peninsula on the\nnext day's ride one of the day stops was\non the ruins of ancient Nea it was a bit\nsmaller than some of what we saw in\nAthens and Corinth but there was an\nimpressive ruin of the Temple of Zeus\nthat dates back to the 4th Century BC\nthe riding was becoming more Scenic with\ndistant Blue Hills all around us and GR\nGroves of old olive trees and cypresses\nlining the road I was mesmerized by this\ntiny Hill with what looked like castle\nruins on top shining in the Sun at dusk\nwe reached our destination which was the\ntown of mikin chosen because it was next\nto yet another set of ruins to explore\nnext day rinse and repeat this time\nthough at the ruins of Ancient M with an\novercast Sky which is rather fitting\ngiven the tragic history of this place\nthe site itself was a bit less visually\nstriking with no tall columns but there\nwas a great museum onite along with this\ncreepy tomb to explore we intentionally\ncame this way because we wanted to see a\nlot of culture but we were also starting\nto realize that there's so many sites in\nsuch a small area that we have to pick\nand choose which ones to see and which\nones to skip once the day's Explorations\nwere done we wrote a short distance to\nthe town of Argos for lunch Argos is one\nof the oldest continuously populated\ncities in the world the castle on the\nhill I saw earlier is located here on\nyet another Acropolis which just means\nCity on a Hill in Greek in case you are\nwondering we settled for looking at it\nfrom below and continue to arrive\ntowards the Gulf of argolis and the City\nof Napo here again we ran into our old\nenemy and I know what you're thinking\nand no it's not dogs I'm kind of known\nfor uh complaining about dogs chasing me\nand Greece has a reputation in the bike\ntouring circles for aggressive dogs\nthough we found them to be pretty well\nbehaved in our trip now the Real Enemy\nwas this Insidious goat head Thorn\nNatalie had two Flats on the first day\nof riding another on the second day of\nriding and and when we were coming out\nof Argos we rode through a big fat patch\nof these things they are an annoying\ninvasive plant that grows all over the\nplace and is pretty unremarkable looking\nand easy to miss its thorns are really\nsharp and pierce tires easily Natalie\nwas getting the worst of it because she\nhad Supple gravel tires that would\nusually be run tubeless while Bobby and\nI had touring tires with the added flat\nprotection that comes with After\nexperiencing all the joy of patching\ntubes daily and changing several Flats\non the road Natalie finally went to a\nbike shop to replace the tubes with some\nsealant and never had another another\nflat on the trip even the touring to IR\ngot at least one or two Flats so it's\ndefinitely something to watch out for if\nyou're riding this part of the world\nNapo was a busy City with lots of\nhistorical sites and was actually\nbriefly the capital of Greece in the\n19th century our first impression that\nit was a bit too touristy but we still\nchose to stay another night when we\nrealized how much there was left to see\nthere were nice cobblestone streets\nseveral castles and there was even a\nbeach at one side of town it was only\nthe fifth day of the riding portion of\nthe trip we already taking our second\nrest\nday it made for an unimpressive mileage\ntotal but it left more time to take\nphotos photos of\ncastles photos of\nruins photos of\nLandscapes and photos of cats there were\na lot of cats and many of them were very\nfriendly especially if you gave them\nfood bunch of adorable Beggars we\nclimbed the castle above the city to\ntake in the views before packing up to\nhit the road again the next day after\nNao we crossed back to the north nor\ncoast of pelones and the rest of our\ntrip was spent riding East towards poros\nwe explored an ancient theater in\nepidavros an incredibly well preserved\nsite with dramatic scenery that served\nat the backdrop to many plays in\nAntiquity the seaside town of ancient\nepidavros was a peaceful place to spend\nthe night with lots of affordable\nlodging options the riding along the\ncoast had some stunning paved ups and\ndowns we ran into the only other set of\ntouring cyclists of the whole trip on\nthis stretch a lovely couple from\nAustralia that were smiling the whole\ntime we stopped for the night in the\nvolcanic town of methana our first\nimpression that we made a huge mistake\nthere was a thick sulfur smell like\nrotten eggs coming towards us that kept\ngetting stronger until we reached the\nsource at the entrance of the city it\nwas this terrifying pool of Milky water\nnext to an abandoned hotel that\napparently people bathe in I was not\ngoing anywhere near it luckily though\nthe wind pulled all of that smell away\nfrom the actual center of the city where\nwe would stay and we can actually enjoy\na meal without puking a nice French\ncouple we met who also bik tour but\nwe're not touring in the this particular\ntrip took this photo of us holding our\nnoses just like last year the end of our\ntrip was marked by rain we delayed our\ndeparture to wait out the worst of it\nonce we got going the last day of riding\nwas probably the most beautiful of the\nwhole trip we rode through this dirt\nroad along an olive farm with pines and\nstunning Coastline views at every turn\nthe coast of Love apparently and I\ntotally loved\nit\na\nafter a few more amazing miles along the\ncoast we arrived in galates it's a small\nPort Town a short distance away from the\nisland of poros not to be confused with\nthe island of\nparos we took a 10-minute ferry ride and\nset our things down at a hotel in the\nharbor strangely porus was not even\nmentioned in my Greece travel guide book\nbut has a ton of yachts and tourists\nalong with the usual Fair of restaurants\nand gift shops the town in the Hills\nbehind the harbor was incredibly\npicturesque we walked around the tiny\nalleys with colorful windows and\ndoorways for a little while until the\nrains came back we chose porous to end\nour ride in because there's a fairly\nquick FY back to Athens that runs\nfrequently from here we were delayed by\nweather again but eventually got going\nand made it back to the City in time for\nyet another Deluge of rain I'd be lying\nif I said food wasn't a motivation for\nchoosing to go to Greece the food was\nterrific though I wouldn't say I was\nblown away probably my expectations were\nSkyhigh and were met though not exceeded\nimagine you guys are not\ndisappointed uh something I learned was\nbasically every dish can improve with\ncapers I usually have a jar in back of\nmy fridge but since coming back from\nGreece I've added Capers to more and\nmore food one standout meal was this ier\nof shrimp in a lemon sauce with some\nincredibly fresh and flavorful Capers I\nregret not getting seconds one area that\ndid far exceed our expectations was\nHospitality at times I couldn't believe\nI was in Europe where I regularly expect\nSurly and indifferent staff on at least\nthree occasions the hotel workers\noffered to let us pay less for our stay\ncompletely unprompted one amazing place\nwe stayed at in particular was the Petit\nplanet in Mikes besides having this\nbeautiful view from the courtyard the\nlady who ran it was incredibly sweet to\nto us she even offered to drive us the\nkilometer or two to the ruins so we\nwouldn't have to lock up our bikes and\ngave us a guide book to borrow we found\nGreek people to be extremely warm and\nfriendly the whole trip always eager to\nhelp us get the most enjoyment out of\ntheir\ncountry\nthis awesome pita sandwich was the first\nthing we ate in Athens and also the last\nwe did one last bit of sightseeing and\nthen had the joy of carrying our bike\nboxes across town to our Airbnb where we\nwould have to pack them up as with most\ntrips I feel like it was a bit too short\nand went by too fast I hope to come back\nand see the rest of the peninsula along\nwith more of the Mainland and maybe more\nof the islands as well big thank thanks\nto Bobby and Natalie for being rad\ntravel buddies and not complaining when\nI spent hours taking the same photo over\nand over again also thanks to my friend\nManny who gave some great advice on\nwhere to go and what to see this video\ntook a long time to release because of\nhow much effort it takes to organize my\nthoughts and all that kind of stuff\nleave a comment if it was useful and at\nleast somewhat enjoyable uh thanks for\nwatching"

Two hundred kilometres and 6.200 meters of elevation brought us joy, left us with significant memories and filled us with the absolutely necessary feel of peace. \nThis is the short version (trailer). A more detailed video is coming up.",
