feed you\nbreakfast lunch and dinner\njust over 700 of these crazy folks\nlook Becker here yo changing some Focus\nsettings here\nare you kidding me one of the things\nthat's so cool about grindero is that\nthere are four time segments throughout\nthe whole ride or Race So until you get\nto those segments you do not have to\nrace you can just ride the ride and each\nsegment is completely different from the\nnext there's a road time trial a gravel\ndescent a gravel climb and a single\ntrack section so no matter what bike you\nhave you have brought the wrong bike\n[Laughter]\nDrew what's the game plan are we trying\nfor these segments are we just like\ndoing the thing we're just doing the\nthing okay yeah\ndoing the thing\nalso grind hero notoriously Dusty\nturn up that atmosphere\nhey Drew hey Dustin hey tell me about\nyour bike oh I'm glad you asked this is\nuh Canyon Grizzle grinduro purple it's\naluminum heavy heavy wheels and the\nprice is right at 2000 I hear\nit's working out\n[Applause]\nGalvin long time no see long time no see\nhey tell me about your bike this is a 99\nKlein I believe I'm fitted with a\nmodern Parts on a vintage bike what size\ntires you're running I

the Queen here we go\noh I'm getting tired this section is\nkind of long\nhow was that fun\nfirst segment down the vibe is settled\ninto the ride some people are going a\nlittle more chill some people are taking\nit a little serious\neveryone's finding their Rhythm how's\nyour Rhythm Drew uh a little loose\noh oh that's just the headset\nsnack stop\nthey've got a very busy bike support\nthere's alcoholic drinks I think there's\nbacon food watermelon everybody's\nconfused nobody knows where they're\ngoing\nhey Albert what's your perfect party to\nrace ratio\nI would say grindero a solid 95 to 5 95\nParty come here it's awesome the riding\nis amazing Rory tell me about your bike\nit's a discontinued unfortunately salsa\nPowder Keg put some SRAM axis with some\nof the Shimano Saint downhill breaks and\nsome velocity rims made in America\nkeeping it non-carbon on this bike but\nyeah we're stoked probably a smart move\nyeah\n29 by 2.4 is the tire selection for\ntoday\nGene\nyou\n30 miles

try to Soldier on\nfor the good of all mankind\nI was done\nnow the trick is to make sure I don't\ncompletely deplete myself before the\nnext two stages and the third one I\nfancy myself like\na mid-level contender for\nfor the middle\nI think I can land right in there\nnice and nice and soft in the middle\noh yeah I went with the dco today I've\njust been through the most stuff with it\nso whatever this is gonna dish at me I\nmay not enjoy it but I will be able to\nstruggle through it\nthanks to my familiar whip\nthe old dco\nlove you buddy Shameless plug this is\nthe last year villier's gonna offer the\nyena with the dco colorway that I made\nit's like a decline colorway a little\ncommotion camo so if you want one now\nmight be the time and if you don't keep\ndoing what

but I didn't crack and I'm\nI'm proud of that\nthere were definitely a lot of people\nwho did crack and if you don't want to\nwait till next year to ride this exact\nsame course the route's already

      "description": "I raced Grinduro in Quincy this weekend\u2014the full 50-mile gravel grinder, up Mount Hough. The weather was perfect: clear blue skies with just a few clouds.\n\nThe course was a mix of fire road climbs through pine forest and long single-track descents. Higher up, we passed through burned sections where only the blackened skeletons of trees remain. The singletrack was dramatic\u2014cut tight into the side of the mountain with sweeping alpine views across the valley. Fast, technical, and a real upper-body workout on a gravel bike.\n\nMy race was shaped by flats. Four in total. The trouble began when I misjudged a bunny hop over one of the water channels cut across the fire road. I landed the rear wheel hard, dinged the rim, and the tyre started threatening to unseat itself. After two stops to reseat it, I put in a spare tube\u2014only to find the spare tube already punctured from sitting too long in my saddle bag. A patch held briefly before failing, and later I picked up a thorn puncture for good measure. Too much time fixing tyres meant I fell back through the field and missed the last timed stage, but I still got around the full course.\n\nDespite that, it was a brilliant ride. My new Redshift suspension stem and seatpost both did their job. No saddle sores, even on a rough course and I was able to achieve a new power record. The new Silca saddle bag was discreet and rattle-free. On the downside, I think I\u2019ve put a buckle in the rear wheel.\n\nCamping in Quincy wasn\u2019t my preference, but it worked out fine. A new sleeping bag was warm and comfortable, even with heavy dew soaking the outside of the tent and bag in the morning. I only camped Friday night\u2014packing up dry on Saturday evening meant I avoided dealing with a wet tent.\n\nDinner was sociable. I met Rich, from the Bay Area, riding an Ibis Ripley he was considering buying. He\u2019s planning to do the Bovine Classic in a couple of weeks on his Stigmata. I also chatted with Pierre, from Houston via Paris, who owns a collection of custom frames, including two Mosaic titanium builds.\n\nFifty miles and 7,500 feet of climbing made for a hard day out, but Grinduro delivered: big climbs, amazing singletrack, stunning scenery, and a proper adventure\u2014even if I did spend too much of it with a pump in hand.",

      "description": "This year Grinduro returned to its roots in idyllic Quincy, CA, where it felt small in all the right ways. I got to spend quality time with some of my favorite bike buds and the entire event really felt like a throwback to those special early days at the Plumas-Sierra County Fairgrounds. It wasn\u2019t a nostalgia trip \u2014 I think everyone there would acknowledge that we\u2019ve all changed. The world has changed. But we showed up this weekend with the desire to recapture that old magic. Like all successful magical acts, all you have to do is believe in it enough to make it come true. Thank you for being magic, Grinduro. \n\nI rode my new Sklar SuperSomething loaded with a gucci bleep-bloop build kit featuring SRAM Force AXS 13-speed, DT Swiss GRC Dicut wheels, Ritchey Venturemax bars, SimWorks Rhonda stem, Sklar titanium seatpost, and Maxxis Rambler 700x50 tires.",
