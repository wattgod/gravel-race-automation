      "transcript": "Hey, I was just wondering if you could tell\nme what Grinduro is and what it means to you.\nJust German only, I think.\nHey, I\u2019m Miranda Miller I\u2019m your host\nof this episode of SRAMtv.\nWe're in Hellenthal Germany for Grinduro.\nI've never raced gravel, never been to a Grinduro,\nso we're gonna go find some people to kind\nof tell us how it all works.\nLet's go!\nHow many gravel events have you done in the\npast?\nI did my first ever gravel event was the Steamboat\nSprings Gravel in 2019, then I had a two-year\nhiatus - uh three years.\nAnd I did one last weekend, well a couple\nof weekends ago I did the Rancho in Spain,\nit was going really well until the 130k mark\nwhere I punctured because I didn't have tubeless,\nand I didn't realize tubeless was a thing\nat gravel events.\nBut I think this weekend I have tubeless so\nfor my third gravel event I'm third time lucky,\nI'm feeling prepared.\nWoah!\nPfff.\nWay too high.\nWhere did you ride from?\nI rode 300 kilometers and need a beer.\nThere it is \u2013 the man's got a beer!\nSo, I\u2019m here with a World Champion, past\nWorld Champion, who just opted out of the\nPro category.\nCan you fill me in on your mindset?\nYeah, when I got the question, I just felt\nit was super intimidating because, yeah, I\nreally did not know what to answer.\nIt was the first time that I really had to\nanswer that question after retiring and I\nwas like, \u201cwell, no.\nTechnically no.\u201d\nAnd what brings you to Grinduro Germany.\nWell, um, the format.\nI've heard really good things about this format,\nand I was like, you know what we're gonna\ntry that out.\nSo, there's been a lot of talk around the\npit that you are bringing the Heat this weekend.\nWhat do you think about that?\nI think maybe German only\nYou are very good at riding very long distances,\naren't you?\nYes, and slow is key in long distance because\nyou can you can continue for days and days\nand days and weeks and months, and not Years\nyet.\nWhat's your longest ride?\nMy longest one is I went to North Cape, so\nnorth of Norway it was like 4,600 kilometers.\nChill\u2026easy\u2026easy.\nWhat's your favorite part about Grinduro?\nWell, it's fun!\nCarlos, you're definitely a little more well\nknown for the road cycling, but uh here you\nare at Grinduro Germany.\nWhat inspired you to come here?\nHave fun on the bike.\nThe season in Road was quite long and hard,\nand so at the end of the season I talked to\nthe team, and I happened to think, why don't\ndo something different?\nGoing to ride gravel, you know, I think now\nit's quite popular.\nAnd enjoy cycling life in a way you that you\nknow is competitive and more social.\nAt Grinduro, we take our Prologues seriously.\nSo again, stand still start.\nYou get three attempts, and your fastest time\nwill be on record.\nGo, go, go!\nI feel like I tried harder, but I don't know\nif I went faster.\nIt's too hard.\nThe first race day hammered rain and wind\nall night.\nSo, we're going to go see if there's any casualties\nin the campsite.\nWe came with the train all the way from Geneva\nto here, and then from the train station we\nrode here in the dark.\nIt was awesome, it was really nice.\nAnd you camped last night?\nYeah, we camped last night I was staying alone\nin the car, in the tent and I was really cold.\nHa-ha.\nHow was your sleep last night?\nIt was short and I was scared actually because\nI heard a little rain coming down and I was\nabout to leave, and thought \u201ccome on, I\ncan't leave now.\u201d\nYeah, I live one and a half hour away.\nYou could have gone home.\nHa yeah, I could have that\u2019s why I stayed.\nA rain party!\nPitter patter \u2013 better get at \u2018er.\nIt was a wild one out there.\nThe first couple hours were actually kind\nof unbelievable, you know?\nIt was like raining so hard and like so windy,\nbut at the time I was like I was warm, so\nI didn't really care.\nBut like, I was just saying this is probably\nlike the longest 50k I've ever done.\nUh, yeah it didn\u2019t help that I had a double\npuncture\u2026double puncture.\nI'm curious to see like the singletrack stuff,\nbecause if it's like if it's like grass with\na little bit of you know gravel or whatever\nthen that's going to be pretty grippy, but\nif it's if it's blown out and it's just like\na mud chute like everything else is.\nI don't know how you're gonna stop or turn\u2026So\nanyways, it's sick\nHoly.\nI can't ride down there.\nTrying to record this on my GoPro.\nThis could be me dying on camera.\nThe day is over here at Grinduro Germany.\nIt was an eventful day.\nPouring rain in the morning, blue skies in\nthe afternoon.\nIt almost felt like two separate days.\nIt's been an interesting experience getting\nto kind of meet everyone and learn how they\ngot here.\nA common theme has been people just finding\na new way to get into nature and experience\nfreedom.\nLet's go talk to some racers before this party\ngets started.\nSo, Myles you race road bikes and gravel,\nand you're just getting into mountain biking.\nYeah.\nYou're a Cat 1 racer?\nCat 1 / 2, but who's counting?\nNot me.\nHa-ha\nI feel like it's a balance - especially at\na race like this.\nSetting your own goals for yourself about\nwhat you want to do, and you know feel good\nhave fun ride.\nBut obviously winning is contingent on how\neverybody else does as well, so I think it's\nkind of this balance where you want to try\nto beat other people but at the end of the\nday if that doesn't go according to plan,\nor someone like Carlos Verona shows up\u2026and\nyou\u2019re like, well that's like World Tour\nfitness and I'm never gonna have that, at\nleast right now.\nYou kind of have to manage expectations, so\nI think it's a tricky thing to do a little\nbit, but I think that it also forces you to\nmaybe look at the day that you want to have\nand just feel good about the effort that you\ngave and how you rode your bike.\nWhat are your initial impressions of gravel\nin Europe?\nYou know, lots of competition or like crazy\nroads, or what's stood out the most for you?\nI mean like, what I'm most happy with gravel\nriding is like, if there is a race I can compete\nand it's possible to win.\nIt\u2019s not like road in Europe, so I'm happy\nwith this and that's a big impression for\nme.\nIt\u2019s a thing that I can win, so I'm happy\nwith it."

      "description": "Grinduro returns to Hellenthal in 2023! Save the dates: May 5 - 7. Entries open soon!\n\nThe Eifel is a region famous for both delighting and torturing cyclists. So no surprise that we chose the Eifel to host such a wild event as Grinduro Germany. But what exactly is Grinduro? It\u2019s a combo of a gravel grinder road race and mountain bike enduro: one long loop on all kinds of terrain, where finishing times aren\u2019t based on overall loop time, but four timed segments.\n\nThe routes are a mix of everything from pavement, gravel and single trail. Grinduro is held in enduro format, with four stages ridden in race mode, the rest of the tour can be enjoyed without time pressure. It's both beautiful and challenging. With a well-balanced mix of paved and unpaved, flat and hilly, fast and technical, social and competitive.",
