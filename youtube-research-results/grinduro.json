      "transcript": "I'm off to Tuscany in Italy\nheaded to my first ever gravel race\nthe green Duro is a race I've always\nwanted to do and it's a race with a\ndifference it comes in some fast riding\nit's a fun riding yeah it's an epic\ncamping\nand some insane party\n[Music]\nthank you\nI was itching to get riding so I built\nup my bike and headed over to the event\nVillage\nthe green churro is an event like no\nother and it encompasses everything I\nlove about cycling an unreal location\nsome epic riding and some of the same\npartying and I did remember a flannel\nshirt oh yeah\nthis bucket list experience for me is\nwill be made possible thanks to\ncampagnolo and seller San Marco who not\nonly have kitted me out with everything\nneeded for a proper Adventure but\nthey've also sorted me out with the\nechar one by gravel group set but more\non that a little bit later first up\nlet's give you the lowdown on what this\nevent is all about as mentioned before\nthis is a gravel race in Tuscany Italy\nthe event begins as a mass start and it\ncovers a total of 103 kilometers with\n1480 meters of elevation however you're\nonly timed over four different stages on\nthe route the first stage is a hill\nclimb 2.8 kilometers long with an\nelevation gain of 160 meters the second\nstage is a downhill stage 3.7 kilometers\nlong now this is one I've got my eyes\nset on then there's the third stage\nwhich the real fun bit of single track\nsegment in the woods with a total\ndistance of 3.8 kilometers long the\nfinal one is a down country stage of 1.7\nkilometers long again another one I've\nif they got my eyes set on the winner of\nthe race is the one with the lowest\ncumulative time across all four\ndifferent stages let's see if this old\ndog has still got it\nforeign\nwith eight kilometers the first stage I\ntook in the incredible Tuscan scenery\nand I got talking with some of the other\nRiders and then we decided to stick\ntogether\nthat's stage one done\nSavage\ntoday's quite ready for that\n190 BPM shadow block\nI feel like\nthat segments\ncould be my worst one\nnow\nlet's be a chilled riding\nget my breath back\nbefore the next segment hopefully I can\ndo slightly better\nlet's go\na special event like this needs a\nspecial bike so let's take a look at\nwhat I'm riding today the bike I'm\nriding for this event is the obeyer\nTerra in full stealth mode fitted with\nthis\nis 13 speeds mechanical Eckhart group\nset it's their first ever specific\ngravel group set designed and created\njust 317 kilometers north of this very\nlocation on the Kima econ mountain now\nin signing up for this event I wanted\nsomething that was light that was fast\nand that was durable and campagnolo say\nthis is the lightest ever specific\ngravel group set and in their lightest\nconfiguration it weighs just\n2385 grams now these are campagnola's\nLevante carbon wheel set now the rim\ndepth is just 30 millimeters and the\nweight yeah get this 1500 grams yeah a\ndurable light and fast wheel oh and I\nhave got to say they uh match up nicely\nwith my stealth black look no one's\ngoing to see me coming when I fly\nthrough the group\nI hope they do actually campagnola have\nalso been working with magura to develop\nthat hydraulic brake system now as we\nknow Comfort is one of my highest\npriorities when riding a bike so send us\na marker who sorted me out with the new\nRegal shorts yes this was actually\ndesigned and reinvented from their\niconic saddle the Regal back in 1983.\nnow it's a subtle I didn't really\nremember because uh well I wasn't born\nyet the interesting thing about this\nsaddle though it has the new bow rail\nsystem now seller San Marcos say this\nadds to the flexibility of the off-road\nriding which is exactly what I need at\nfront I've got the seller San Marco two\nliter handlebell back because well I\nwanted to fit in in gravel I know I'm\nnot together for this one Beauty\nfound Alex Alex is uh kind of helping me\npace through in the transitions but it's\nfar faster than me in the segments\nwhich is pretty cool actually means I've\ngot a carrot\nlook at that for a Tuscan View\nthe great thing\nabout an event like this\nis that you can be lost\nin the whole race\nbut still come first\nwhich kind of my kind of race\nit means\nthe long sections\nyou can chill out\nenjoy it\ntaking the view\nand then you can smash it in the\nsegments\noh\n[Applause]\nit's time for some lunch\nit's the only race I've done where you\nget an alcohol for even Negroni with it\non your feed station Alex cheers buddy\nso that's majority of the climbing done\nfeed station\nI'll call free Negroni\nit's downhill\nand it's on to the next segment\nthree to go\n65k done\nwith the downhill segment\nyou okay\nso my buddy I've been riding with Alex\nhe's kind of been helping me the whole\nway through this has had a big Cropper\nI've got 55k an hour\nand on cobbles yeah um so it's probably\nthe worst place to crash but he's in\ngood spirits\nsecond segment done the downhill\nunfortunately\nAlex is a big crash the guy was riding\nwith you've got to take care of your\nfriends that's the main thing\nraces come and go\nnow it's time to get a feed in and then\nback on the road\n25k to go two segments oh yeah\nthere we have it\nstage three done that was technical\nproperty\nand I'm not gonna lie\nthe Heat\nis really starting to get to me\nit's just so hot\nand I'm just not used to\nbut\nI think I did all right in that section\nsegment four the last one\nwith all the stages complete it only\nleft the short ride back to the finish\nand a well-earned drink\num\nyes mates whoa done\nI survived my first ever gravel race and\nI'm going to be honest I absolutely\nloved every minute of it but you want to\nknow the results first segment was the\nhill climb a tough steep climb I went\nstraight into the red hit 190 BPM and\nbasically suffered the whole way to the\ntop the result was 14 which I'm pretty\nhappy with I'm gonna be honest I thought\nI'd be actually lower down the field\nthan that the second one was a big\ndownhill stretch now I I'm pretty\nconfident on the descents and I'm pretty\nhappy with my uh descending skills and\nmy you know bike handling but\nunfortunately Alex which actually turns\nout to be alicio took a big Cropper I\nmean he crashed hard and it really\nwouldn't have been kind if I just shot\noff and tried to win the segment so I\nstayed with him and last 25 minutes and\nthat result was kind of out the window\nthen so it was on to segment three one\nof the technical bits a bit of single\ntrack I was looking forward to this one\nbecause I've been done some training\nwith um is in Blake over on the mega\nAvalanche so I was quite looking forward\nto getting a bit of technical writing\nunder my belts and I came out all right\ndid nice which I'm pretty happy about\nwith a crash a small one if that and\nthen the fourth one this was the last\nsegment after 98k of bacon in the heat I\nwas hoping I was just going to get\nanother little little bit of energy in\nand I came out with six which actually\nthinking about it was a one of one of my\nbest results so all in all what an epic\nevent on an unreal location ending with\na Sunset and a beer\nand then for some dancing\nthis is Italian beer is pretty good\nanyway ciao for now see you next time\nmake sure you hit that thumbs up button\nand big thank you to campaniola and\nCelesta Marco for getting me to the\nstart line of my first ever gravel race\ncheers guys"

      "transcript": "welcome to gravel racing\n[Applause]\nI don't want to go this way don't go off\nthe cliff don't go off the cliff okay\ndude\n[&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\ngood morning we are at the Rock cobbler\n10.0 the 10th version of this uh I've\nlearned so much from last year and so\nthe bike that I'm running much different\nthan a full-on road bike uh I also have\na skin suit and\nBella does now how stupid is mellow toes\non a eight seven hour gravel ride I\ndon't know who cares I like the way they\nlook look good ride hard hey so we're\ngonna break down my version of the raw\ncobbler 10.0 we're going to start with\nthe course kind of go through the\nsections I saw it so we started with a\nreally fast part this is everyone trying\nto separate themselves that moved into\nthe mud Canyon which was totally crazy\nand caused a lot of issues for a lot of\npeople then there was the cow path of\ndeath probably the most spectacular spot\nof the course uh then we had a insane 45\npercent grade hike a bike section that\nmoved on to the fun part the best part\nof the course absolutely amazing then I\nhad a small little oopsie we will talk\nabout this\num and not the spoiler alert but my\ncrash and rally and how I kept going\nafter the hardest crash of my life real\nquick let's break down the bike I'm\nrunning my Canyon Grizzle this thing is\nan absolute Beast now we threw on the\nSRAM xx1 derailleur mountain bike\nderailleur so we could run the 11 52\nrotor setup with the ceramic rotor\nbottom bracket and I'm running a 40 6\noval in the front huge shout out to\nJustin from competitive cycles for\ngetting this to me in time that dropper\npost unbelievable but the main part of\nthis is the forks the 30 mils of travel\ncompletely changes the way this thing\nhandles I threw on my ultimate\nintegrated bars\nso awesome light and comfy my favorite\nsaddle of all time but that dropper post\n50 mils of travel wow now we're running\nthe IRC double cross 42s with orange\nseal I've never flattened those tires\nwe're running the KDX 35 AR hookless\ngravel specific Wheels this thing is a\nmonster the absolute perfect bike to\nbring to The Cobbler we have started\nspicy\nit is spicy\nso we're gonna break down the fast part\nhere and it started with a thousand\npeople 1 000 people that's insane so\nthere was four waves 250 in each wave\nright\num so the the front of this got spicy\nfast now I'm doing 700 Watts on this\nbike path this part of the the course\nthough this is the weakest part for my\nbike so last year I wrote a full-on road\nbike setup that was extremely fast on\nthe road but I never really used it\nanytime we were on anything fast it was\nvery limited and or we weren't even\ngoing that fast like the lead out last\nyear was was really slow it's like the\nsecond we hit the gravel it was on so\nthen I was like oh of course the time I\nbring the bike that's not fast on the\nroad everyone's smashing on this road\npart but it was okay you know it got\nspicy for a minute but for the most part\nI'm feeling really really good right now\nmy fitness is on point I have been\nriding the trainer for 90 days so you\nknow like look I am ready to be outside\nand to give it the absolute berries huge\ngroup of people right everyone's trying\nto fight uh to get to the front before\nwe hit the single track my teammate\nJulian here he's actually in a breakaway\nwith Corey Williams at CBR\num he ended up getting ninth overall in\nthis race so fantastic job to him I want\nto talk way more about the race team and\nand what's going on there later on in\nthe year but look we hit this climb\nand it's it's spicy okay but not like\noutrageous no one's giving a full-on\nattack and I came in with a plan to\nabsolutely Pace myself I'm gonna Dylan\nJohnson myself I am going to pace for 80\nmiles I don't care anyone around me this\nis a new tactic for me but it worked out\nfor for Dylan Johnson I don't care who's\naround me I don't care if anyone's\nriding away from me I care nothing about\nme I'm the only one I care about so I'm\ngoing to set my power I'm going to focus\non an 80 mile five hour race and that's\nit that's all I'm focusing on now I\ndon't plan on stopping at any rest stops\nI have two bottles on me with 800\ncalories and 200 grams of carbs and then\nin my hydro pack I have basically the\nsame thing\num I've got 70 grams of ketones on me\nthat I will be taking in periodically\nthroughout the ride so I I'm dialed with\ncalories and carbs and ketones I'm good\nnow are we going mach 10 into a hard\nright uh yes and I posted this on\nInstagram 1.6 million views it was a\n[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] show dude a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] show\noh\nwow\ndumb ways to die\nso after Top Gun freaking went moctan\ninto the group I had actually lost a ton\nof space because I was like in my\nbiggest gear and whatever so now I gotta\ncatch up uh I'm probably what like 50th\nish maybe but it's time to let this bike\neat and with that 46 52 I was able to\nclimb everything outside of the hiker\nbike section which no one on the face of\nthe planet could ever climb uh I I could\npedal up every single thing\nso I was just like right now and then\ndue to the right who looks like Chase\nJackson actually that's like the exact\nsame bike that I was riding last year\nso I'm pacing myself dude in the blue\nBlows By Me that's fine cool dude I am\nsticking to my plan and I am going to\nfeel out my bike now I said this before\nuh I even got here I put it on Instagram\nI said I'm probably gonna leave in a\nhospital I'm gonna leave in a hospital\nI'm Gonna Leave in an ambulance to a\nhospital because the bike is so spunky\nand allows you this uh fake confidence\nthat you're on a full suspension\nmountain bike this bike that I'm on eats\neverything it it's so wild and so I was\nlike trying to take it a little bit easy\num guy comes around me almost runs into\na shopping cart why is there a shopping\ncart here because\nI mean there's just trash everywhere out\nhere in Bakersfield for some reason but\nI will say that Bakersfield in February\nis\noutstandingly beautiful the Rolling\nGreen Hills it I I'm just insane\ndude get on the group\nyeah you got it\nprobably one of the cooler spots on the\ncourse visually and look I talk a lot\nduring the ride I I give commentary with\nthe GoPro in my mouth uh but also to\nother people like I just give\nencouragement\nI'm Just a Good Guy Greg it is what it\nis so I'm sitting probably top 30 right\nnow and I was being a little bit\nhesitant with the bike again like I said\nI felt like\nI am going to oh I'm going to ask too\nmuch of these tires\nand then I'm going to break my face so I\nwas trying to sort of ease into it a\nlittle bit because there's so many\nplaces here where you could go 50 miles\nan hour get cross-redded and then you're\nin the ER\num and I don't want to do that so early\non again pacing myself so remember the\ndude who flew by me uh at the top of\nthat climb okay I'm catching him and I'm\nmoving on so I'm very happy with my\npacing I'm on top of my fueling like\nnobody's business\nthis is honestly\nthe best I've ever ridden uh technically\nand and intelligently like the way that\nI paste it the way I fueled it my bike\nChoice usually I'm an idiot I was not an\nidiot here\nI mean maybe I become an idiot a little\nbit later but then we go through a guy's\nhouse a thousand people go through this\nhouse\n[Music]\nlet's go\nthat was so cool yeah\nso we are flying and look I use this\ndropper post I I almost ran the battery\nout I use the dropper post so much I\nused it while pedaling right\nall right top 30-ish feeling good\nwe're pacing we're letting it burn\nlaughs\nso after a rip and Road section we get\ninto this insanely long climb now again\nI'm a genius I'm learning so much about\nhow to race bikes uh and so you know\nafter 12 years kind of I learned a thing\nor two but I have the map set up also I\nhave the live segments set up and\nstarred so that right here I can you can\nsee my bike computer dude I I know\nwhat's up I know what's up I didn't have\nto study the course like I have this\nthing telling me I've got about a 25 to\n30 minute climb ahead of me so am I\ngoing to Pace yes I'm gonna pace so well\nnow are these guys flying sure in times\npast would I have wanted to be right on\ntheir wheel yeah but not today not today\nHeather\nit's a long climb\nno I had not expected mud whatsoever\nbecause it wasn't raining why would why\nwould there be mud with no rain uh and\nso as we kept going up this climb it\nkept getting muddier and muddier and\nmuddier uh and but it's beautiful and\nagain I've got the live segment on my\ncomputer so I know about how far we're\ngoing I'm feeling really good again\npacing the carbs and ketones uh into my\nsystem fully liquid right I don't I\ndon't eat solid food but the cows not\ntoday boys\nnot today\nlast year uh cows yielded people Bulls\nneeded people not today\num so like you can see this guy right\nhere and it's so hard to explain but his\nwheel is spinning so much faster than\nhis legs if that makes any sense like\nhe's just spinning spinning spinning\nspinning and so stuck in the mud you can\nsee everyone here kind of hitting the\nsame like oh yeah we're we could ride it\nyou could ride it but you'd be doing 800\nwatts and going nowhere so way more\nefficient to walk the bike now I usually\nWalk The Bike by pushing the back seat\num but the way that that and it's so\nhard to show you but the ground is so\nbumpy it's it's uh so rough and so the\nfront wheel kept getting stuck in the\nmud and it was very hard to walk also my\nshoes I have these bonds\nthey are so stiff they are the stiffest\nthings and there's a sex joke in there\nsomewhere\num but you can't really walk in them\nbecause there's no flex in the soul and\nso I actually was like wow these shoes\nare terrible for walking in\num but they're great on the bike\ndude there's no traction\ncome on\nthat's so wild wow okay\noh wow oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\nwow that is Marty\nokay\nholy smoke\noh my God\nI don't want to go this way\nsorry so after surviving mud Canyon and\nlook this was so frustrating because my\nbike was the bike for this section this\nis where I was going to make up a ton of\ntime we're definitely not lose time\nright and so I go off in the grass\nhoping oh I it's way more traction over\nhere great idea my Chain's off\nso right when I'm about to use a you\nknow million IQ bicycle race move your\nboy's got no chain so then I'm like okay\nwell that's normal you know what I mean\nit falls off from time to time but then\nit just spins right off\nand then it just spinned right off and\nit would just spin right off and it\nwould spin right off and I'm like\nI don't understand the mechanism\nof of why the chain is not staying on\nthe sprocket\nbecause I've never had this problem\nbefore so I'm like oh it's got to be my\nderailleur something's wrong with my\nderailleur and then I'm like well I'll\njust try to put the chain back on\nbut upon closer inspection which I did\nnot really see there's so much mud in\nthe chain that it won't go on the\nfreaking sprocket\nso it's just derailing constantly\nbut I don't know that at this point I'm\nlike frazzled I'm like dude I'm I was\nliterally probably top 12 at this point\nlike the best race I've ever had going\nfor me\nand then now it's derailing and I'm just\nlike well I don't understand it and I\ndidn't really give the time to fully\ndiagnose the problem I just thought I'm\ngonna I just need to keep moving\nnow look everyone has problems every\nthat's gravel racing everyone has\nproblems it's about mitigating those\nproblems to where it's not a deal\nbreaker for your race okay uh and so the\nthing is that\nyou can only fix problems that you've\nhad in the past okay so there's a lot of\nissues that will come up that I know\nexactly oh that's the fix to this\nproblem I got it you know or I've I've I\nknow what I'm doing here I don't know\nwhat I'm doing I don't understand the\nproblem my Chain's not twisted my\nderailleur doesn't seem broken but you\ncan see it just is falling off over and\nover and over and over and over again\nand I'm now losing my cool\nsome people in gravel races uh David\nsweet actually one of them who he got a\nflat right away and then he was just\nlike fine about it bro I'm throwing a\ntemper tantrum I'm not showing you the\naudio\nbecause you would think less of me\nbecause I am literally a two-year-old\nkid who has lost their juice box so I\ntry to pull a Chris room and I am\nsprinting trying to get to the top\nbecause I'm super close to the downhill\nwell maybe I can just run to the top of\nthis\num and then I can descend down\nuh without pedaling and try to get to an\naid station to try to fix it or\nsomething and dude\nnever let me work on your bike I don't\nknow what I'm doing I'm just yanking on\nstuff I'm pulling on stuff I am so very\nmad uh I'm I'm\ndisappointed in my behavior but whatever\nI pop off okay I I don't hold grudges\nwhatsoever\num so when bad things happen I just\nimmediately go from zero to ten freak\nout you know think that the world is\nagainst me why me\nand then I forget about it right I don't\nhold on to those feelings anyways so\nthen I'm like trying to go down this\nChain's not on the bike I don't\nunderstand what's happening\num I've lost so much time probably five\nsix minutes something like that right so\nthen I get to these little Hills and\nwell I have no chains so I have to jump\noff I have to run over this little Hill\nand uh and hopefully something's gonna\nhappen right okay we fixed it there was\njust mud in the chain and it would not\ngo on the sprockets though I've never\nseen anything like that before\ndude we lost so much time\nhi Mr diet Health yeah my my lower back\nis hurting what can I do while on the\nbike to help my lower back I'm gonna\nneed some core engagement ideally a\nposterior tilt pelvis make sure you're\nfiring your glutes\nmaybe you could stand and just squeeze\nthose suckers\nput a goo between your cheeks so you can\nsqueeze it out so now we come into the\ncow path of death and uh\nI've completely forgot about that my\nbike had problems\nI'm just now trying to make the best of\nthe situation uh and top 20 was my goal\nand I'm still within that if I could\njust have a great rest of the race Brom\ntop 20 for sure uh now I posted this on\nInstagram and a lot of people are like\nbro you should have a mountain bike\nMountain Bikes you know when Roadies do\nmountain bike things\nbro everyone hears has mountain bikes\nthe guy in front of me Derek he rides\nmountain bikes he rips\ndon't go off the cliff don't go off the\ncliff\nso yeah for this very one specific\nsection for a mile is a mountain bike a\nbetter choice for sure but Christopher\nBlevins the world champion short track\nmountain biker is on a gravel bike\ngravel bikes are faster\nthe the drop bars are faster that's the\nwhole point to go fast if you want to\njust finish uh and then I fall right\nhere because like someone else had gone\noff right and my front end just it's all\ngood dude it's all good fine keep going\nit's beautiful you know what I mean but\nwe need to have a a mistake free rice\nfrom here on okay okay well\nthis bike has clapped out\nit was like nothing is working all good\nforeign\ncrap\nhere\nclose to hell\nall right\ngeez\nthe hiker bike section was gnarly very\nuh so you kind of look do you ever\npractice hiking with your bike no And so\nthere's like a form to it there's a way\nto do it um but I was trying to figure\nthat out on the Fly I think it was 45\nwas the gradient and again remember\nabout the stiff shoes the boner shoes I\ncould it was so impossible to walk up\nbecause I would go tow in and then my\nheel was coming out of the shoe\num so then I was trying to like go like\nDuck foot Like Pat like going sideways\nand that wasn't working so I started\ncrawling that was the best way that I\ncould do it but the ground is really\nsoft but it's also super bumpy\nit was really challenging for sure and I\nactually lost Derek uh you know from\ndialed Health here on the hike bike\nsection if you didn't do this right you\ncould lose you could lose two minutes\nthree minutes\nso I mean it I I just love this course I\nlove the rock cobbler event just in\ngeneral but this was the funnest course\nI've ever ridden because it constantly\nhad a new challenge a new thing and so\nyou could you know if you pace yourself\nright if you were a good Rider my\nvolatose all messed up but God it looked\ngood you know if you want to ride hard\nyou have to look good\num there's so much opportunity\nand that's what I think makes a really\ngood race course is opportunity if it's\njust a flat Road well then who's got the\nmost power right who can get the most\nArrow okay\nbut what if you have more to offer what\nif you ride all the bikes what if you\nhave other skill sets so this course had\nthat and it was like every five miles\nthere was a new thing you could do and\nthen we went into the most fun part ever\nnow I don't want to hype this bike up\ntoo much but it was the greatest bike\never to be created ever it's the best\nwith this suspension Fork uh it's only\ngot 30 mils of travel okay and people be\nlike bro just ride a mountain bike\nthere's so many other reasons why this\nbike is awesome but that suspension\ncompletely changes the way that this\nbike handles and behaves then I've got\nthat dropper post now the dropper post\nonly has 50 mils of travel there was an\noption for 75 I should have went with\nthat\nit was a little bit heavier\nbut because I've got Alpha genetics and\nI'm 6'2 the uh the 50 wasn't quite\nenough but it was enough to get Cindy\nand I am flying through this now rest in\npeace can block but what was going\nthrough my head here is that little like\naudio that's trending where he says if\nyou're not scared you're not going fast\nenough\nso that I was very scared I was like bro\nI'm not scared I'm gonna keep going this\nwas like the best I've ever ridden I\nmean this was I couldn't believe how in\ncontrol I felt and safe because usually\nI ride really really safe and now like\nyes do I crash later on sure but I have\nridden something like 13 000 miles per\nincident\nwhich is like really love like that's a\ncrazy ratio right\nuh but right here I get a little too\ncocky\nand I almost crashed\nwhat the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\nbro on a road bike with a rigid seatpost\nyou are eating dirt right there but with\nthis bike it just ate that up no problem\nnow we need to regroup we need to catch\nup we need top 20. so let's go\ndude this bike just eats those descents\nI lost a little time on that hike a bike\nbut we're gonna catch back up\nwe got it dude we've paced so well I'm\nso on top of everything we got 35 miles\nleft to go\nyou\nso now I give the cows like a hey man\nnot today buddies uh and I've got\nthree people in front of me\nso right now I'm probably 20th 19th 18th\nsomething around there it's phenomenal\nthat's unbelievable now like I've been\non the trainer for 90 days outside of\nthe snow trip that I did where I froze\nmy wiener off and and legitimately got\ngrade one frostbite on the tip of my\nweiner that's a story I will tell you uh\nsoon but other than that trip\num I've been on the trainer just\nnon-stop for 90 days\nand my power on the trainer has been\nunbelievable like the gains I'm making\nbecause of how amazing the trainer is\nfor training train training trainer uh\nis I honestly thought like okay there's\nprobably a glitch something's happening\nnow this guy had an issue a lot of\npeople are going to have issues I'm so\nhappy that I my issue is not taking me\nout of the race so like positive panda\nI'm still riding\nbut I always think sometimes man zwift\npower isn't real power\nso yeah am I am I like doing these\ninsane you know I wrote for 14 hours and\naverage 205 Watts raw average okay\nbut that's not real\nso then I would I came into this\nthinking like well dude my power on\nzwift and my numbers is so amazing but\nbut what if I can't even apply that\nbut look at this dude\nthis is not a zwifter right I mean I'm\nflying right now I'm making up so much\ntime on these little hits and to this\npoint right now my normalized power is\nlike\n280 Watts\nmy normalizes 280 watts and we're like\nthree and a half four hours in look at\nthis yo this Grizzle the Cindy Grizzle\nmakes up 15 seconds on this guy uh\nwithout power\nand that's last year I would like it was\nall power like the only time I made up\ntime on anyone was power I would just be\npower power power power power up a climb\nor wherever and then as soon as we hit\nlike a technical section you they're\ngone\nbro I I was getting cocky though\nand I was feeling so good I was in the\nFlow State\nnow if you know what flow state is uh\nit's it's where you just feel one with\neverything so hippie but man I am on it\nI'm rolling like again\nprobably 17th 18th right now and I know\nfor sure because there's another really\nbig climb and I mean we have like 20\nmiles left to ride and I'm I've got so\nmuch gas left\nand so I feel like dude there's a chance\nthat I could maybe work my way close to\ntop ten but right now all I got to do is\nnot get past and I will have achieved my\ngoal now this doesn't maybe look like\nmuch okay the stabilization on the GoPro\nis impossibly good and I've got it in my\nmouth so you can kind of see a little\nbit of how the bars are jarring but man\nthis is uh if you go off the line\nthere's hidden rocks everywhere in the\ngrass and it's extremely bumpy so it's\nlike and I'm doing 20 to 25 right here\nbecause it's sort of a false flat\nand I am going between pedaling and not\npedaling but you can see these huge\nBoulders dude\nyou know how much that would eat you\nbut I'm in the Flow State I'm viben I'm\nso good right now carbed up fueled up\nketones rolling bikes great\nand then I see a guy up the road I'm\nlike oh my goodness I'm gonna catch\nanother guy\noh my goodness I'm gonna catch another\nguy\nand then\noops\nyeah dude\nso let's break this down there's a rock\nright here\nI pedal strike that rock\nand it yeets me\ninto the ground my head bounces twice I\nactually my whole body bounces I'm\ntumbling look at my dumb face\nuh no idea that was not okay\nuh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\noh dude\nI lost my glasses\nuh\nbro\nI've never crashed that's the hardest\nI've ever crashed on a bicycle\nit honestly felt like a dream for a\nsecond I was like Am I Dreaming why am I\ntumbling\nbro that was\nI don't even understand what happened\nso my left eye stopped working uh when I\nhit the ground uh and so I I was like it\ntook me a minute to sort of like should\nI even continue writing should I pull\nout is my brain damaged but now I'm\nrunning a brand new custom fitted 3D\nprinted made in America helmet from calf\nthis is the second ride on it you can\nsee this animation this is a real MRI of\nthe helmet and so the 3D printing so I'm\ntold allows for them to make this like\ninternal hexagon that gives these like\ncrumple zones and the ability to sort of\nmimic like a mips or a spin technology\nthat disperses energy from Impact\nso that's that's the helmet the Cav\nhelmet it fits amazing because it's\ncustom fitted to your head cool but did\nit do its job\nand it's hard to say Obviously uh I'm\ngonna talk a little bit here like I keep\ngoing but I'm so worried that I'm gonna\nhit my head again you know you don't\nwant to hit your head twice\none hit is good enough don't don't crash\nagain so I'm sort of\nactually now that I'm watching the\nfootage back like this is kind of crazy\nhow fast I'm going after blowing my head\nup because like I said my left eye was\ncrossed for five minutes I couldn't get\nit to work it was kind of like paralyzed\ncoming through\nawesome thank you but the helmet took\nall of the blunt like I didn't break a\ncollarbone or a shoulder or a hip or\nanything none of my body hurt\nso then that means that my entire big\nass head took the entire force so the\nfact that I won didn't get knocked out\nis actually crazy\num my eye came back and I look I don't\nwant to like Flex but your boy used to\ndo MMA I used to punch people in the\nface and get punched I also did a lot of\nBrazilian Jiu Jitsu and I've gotten hit\nin the head before and had my eye stop\nworking in a very similar way so I\nactually wasn't alarmed by that\nbut then I got this huge second wind\nand so then I was just motoring so hard\ntrying to catch people caught this guy\non this mountain bike that we saw\nearlier in the video and the guy in the\nblack just up the road\nI got to apologize to him because I\nthought he cut the course I actually\ntook the long way around so he actually\nI I thought he cut the course and I was\nlike dude you cut the course and then I\ncouldn't get on his wheel uh but it was\nmy bad I took a wrong turn so sorry dude\num I kind of like\nsort of talked a little bit of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\nafter the race my bad I apologize I'm a\nbig man for it so anyways my bike isn't\nfast in that section so he gapped me I\nwas so bummed uh then I catch one more\nguy right at the Finish\nyou know\nit's like dude if if I hadn't taken that\nwrong turn\num potentially I could have gotten like\nfour or five more people this guy almost\ncrashes I go to the right I make a huge\noopsie again hit this hole whatever\nthat was 25th right there in front of me\nso even after all these issues I rolled\nin 26th\nwhich I'm actually really happy about\nbecause man one I could have got knocked\nout I could have broke a collarbone\nTyler Williams broke a collarbone uh my\nbike could have broke so many things\ncould have went wrong\nthey didn't\nand so then I went straight to our booth\nuh to slang t-shirts dude\nwhat a booth huh\nI mean immediately after riding 80 miles\nand getting 26th and crashing and all\nthat uh the the response to our booth\nwas unbelievable and so I didn't even\nget out of my bibs do I stayed in my\nbibs till like eight o'clock at night\num the love here was unbelievable I\ncannot recommend this event more\nall right so we got 26 which you know my\ngoal was stock 20 and\nI don't want to make vegan excuses but\nlike without the two major issues I had\ndefinitely think I couldn't\nroll in on top no it doesn't matter uh\nI'm all in one piece that's awesome\num so the new 3D printed helmet uh we\ndid get a little break in there\num and you can actually see it's kind of\nhard to see but\nit did its job it\nI mean I hit my head hard and the other\ncrazy thing is that there's science\nabout ketones and concussion prevention\nand I was all ketoned up so I think that\nthings could have could have went really\nreally bad\nand it's hard sometimes when you're\nfeeling good and everything's going\ngreat to like\nnot look at it that way like I just want\nto look at like all the negative things\nsuck but man every bad thing that did\nhappen\nwas the problem it wasn't a show stopper\nright the issue that I have with the\nchain and the mud guys broke their\nchains\nso anyways great race phenomenal course\nthat is I would say probably the number\none gravel course I've ever raced it was\nso much fun so technical it was like you\nhad to have power but you had to have\nskill and you had to be sending I mean\nit was it was tremendous the booth space\nthat we've got here has just been\nphenomenal Rex came up helping out with\nthe booth guys killing it right I mean\nit's been\nwhat do you think like this is sick\nright yeah that's awesome man people are\nstoked and they like the product and\nthey they recognize that we're out here\nto have fun and ride bikes and yeah it's\ngood vibes if you're on the fence about\ncoming out to the cobbler\nI mean look if you just ride it I mean\n80 miles right\nanyone can really get it done it's just\ngonna take you wanting to get it done\nbut it is so much fun uh I would say\nhonestly it's my number one event in\nCalifornia for sure and you can make it\nout here but I'll definitely be here\nnext year"

Each month hosts Carlo and Olly will be chatting with guests who are passionate about riding off the beaten track\u2026 adventure riding, bike packing and gravel racing.\u00a0\n\n\nFor today\u2019s episode we\u2019re packing our bags and heading off for a long haul gravel adventure. We\u2019re going to be chatting with Phil Evans, a pioneer of multi-day gravel and mountain bike events in locations as inspiring as Sri Lanka and Nepal. We\u2019re going to get an insight from Phil into what it is he loves so much about long haul gravel riding and his top tips if you decide to head somewhere exotic to ride next year.\n\n\nThis episode with:\n\n  \u2022  Phil Evans, owner of Multi-Terrain Biking (https://www.mtb-worldwide.com) \n  \u2022  Hosts Carlo van Nistelrooy and Olly Townsend\n  \u2022  Editor-in-chief Olly on the website GravelUnion.cc\u00a0\n\nWant to bring in ideas for topics or guests?

It offered riders multi-day gravel racing through stunning scenery, but also a \u2018full service\u2019 experience where the organisers take the strain and all the participants need to \u201cis ride.\u201d Jorge Padrones (http://www.instagram.com/jorge_padrones)  headed out to Oregon earlier this year and sent in this fantastic ride report of his experience.\n\n\n\n  \u2022  Travel Gravel - Taken by Albania (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/travel-gravel-taken-by-albania) \n\nWhen Ali Ford (http://www.instagram.com/cyclespy)  told her friends that she was planning to travel to Albania to go on a bikepacking adventure she received a variety of negative responses, but it didn\u2019t put her off going. Fear of the unknown can be quite a big hurdle to setting out on a gravel bike adventure but based on her \u00fcber-positive write-up of her trip, we suspect that Ali will definitely be heading back there in the future. If you\u2019d like to get some great insight into this relatively unknown destination, read on.\n\n\n\n  \u2022  News - Grinduro returns to its spiritual home in Quincy, California.\u00a0 (https://www.gravelunion.cc/article/news-grinduro-returns-to-its-spiritual-home-in-quincy-next-year) \n\nBack in 2015 when the first Grinduro event was held at Quincy, California gravel riding was really in its infancy. Grinduro, where participants experience the perfect mix of timed sections, having a great time with their friends and painting the night purple at the famous after-party, is going to be celebrating its 10th anniversary in style by heading back to its birth place in 2025",

Each month we will be talking\nwith guests who are passionate about\nriding off the beaten track, adventure\nriding, bike packing, and gravel racing.\nI'm your host, Carlo, and behind the\nmicrophone in the UK, it's Ollie. Ollie,\nhow you doing? Very good. Thank you. A\nlittle jetlagged. A little jet lag. I'm\ngood. Well, you had like a like a big\nbig big travel, right? The journey took\nyou a couple of days or one day to fly\nback. Uh, it takes two days to get home\njust cuz the flight schedule didn't\nquite work, but\nwe will talk about the destination a\nlittle later. Um, cuz for today's\nepisode, we're packing up our bags and\nheading off for a longhaul gravel\nadventure. We're going to be chatting\nwith Phil Evans, a pioneer of multi-day\ngravel and mountain bike events in\nlocations as as inspiring as Sri Lanka\nand Nepal. And we're going to get an\ninsight from Phil into what it is he\nloves so much about long haul gravel\nriding and his top tips if you decide to\nhead some somewhere exotic to ride next\nyear. But uh that's uh for a little\nlater when Phil will will join in\nbecause you were in Sri Lanka. I was in\nSri Lanka which is exceptionally jammy.\nAll all my friends just they all kind of\nshake their head and go how do you get\nto go to these places and call it work\nbecause it was your second time uh it's\nyeah second actually third time to Sri\nLanka in total but second time recently.\nWell how did you get there? I mean I\nknow cuz I am exceptionally jammy. I'm\nvery very very fortunate. But you got\ninvited. You went there to you went to\nride the bike there right? Yeah, but it\nwas said I was invited by Sri Lankan\nAirlines, who we're going to talk about\nin a bit, who are incredibly pro-\ncycling. They they really want cyclists\nto go to Sri Lanka. And so I was invited\nover to do a test of the event we're\ngoing to talk about with Phil in a\nlittle while to try out the route and\nmake sure that it worked and look at the\nthe good bits. Give him feedback on it\nand just make sure that it was all going\nto to make sure it I thought it was as\ngood as possible for next year. Okay. So\nyou a dream job. Yeah. Oh, that's my u\nsomething in my in my inbox is is making\nsome noise. Excuse me. I have to close\nuh something down, I guess. Uh there you\ngo. Um yeah, so you're helping out also\nin well writing an article about the uh\nabout the destination, but also about\nthe event and you you you did a recon\nride of of the of the roots. Well, uh\nwe'll discuss everything a little later\nwith with Phil when he joins in. Um we\nalso have we always have like a month's\ntopic uh to chat about. today's going\nbig and I figured that was a good fit\nwith longhaul travel that it can be big\nin all senses of the word. It could be a\nbig destination. It could a big\nadventure or just a big challenge. So\nyeah, I've got three stories that seem\nto fit pretty well with this. The first\none was uh written by a guy called\nGeorge or probably H because he's\nSpanish. Mhm. He went out to Oregon in\nthe States earlier in the year and took\npart in a really fantastic looking\nmulti-day gravel race called the Oregon\nTrail Gravel Grinder. And it was all\nbased around the early explorers going\nto Oregon in search of gold and silver\nand setting up trails to get from to get\ninto the areas where the mines were. And\nso event organizers this year put an\nevent on based on these trails that the\nthe original pioneers in in Oregon went\nto to look for. and and and found\nlooking at the pictures it they did a\ngreat job cuz it really looks likeable,\ndoesn't it? Yeah. Yeah. They it has this\nthis old western feel here and here here\nand there. Yeah. Real cowboy country.\nSo, Oregon Oregon Oregon Trail and uh\nother going big topics because you did\nhow many articles did we do last uh last\nmonth? That was that was one of the\nreasons for doing this is that in uh in\nJuly that was fairly recently that was\nour biggest month ever and we did 28\nstories. So it was partly about going\nbig on all senses of the the word that\n28 stories in a month is our record. I\nknow you have a great team a lot of\nwriters that send in articles but uh do\nyou ever sleep on it? It didn't feel\nlike it that month but 20 2 eight\narticles that's almost an article a day.\nSo that's that's bonkers. So, uh, um, we\ngo from, uh, the US of A to Europe to\nAlbania. Yeah. And this is not a\ndestination that we feature very often\nor that many Europeans would even\nconsider going to, but it was a a story\nwritten by Alli Ford, who contacted us,\nI guess, back in the spring and said\nthat she'd been and loved it. And it was\nher she went as a solo a solo female\nbikepacker. So, it's it's maybe not a\ndestination that many bike packers full\nstop would have thought of going to, let\nalone to go as a solo woman. And she\nloved it and said it it totally blew her\nuh all her expectations were exceeded.\nIt was so and she had a fantastic time.\nCame back with lots of great photographs\nand a really good story. I know that\nAlbania is really really getting more\nand more popular uh as a tourist\nlocation and it because it's it's been\nso isolated for so long time. Exactly.\nYeah, it's it's probably still well like\nit was maybe just after after the after\nthe World War even. Yeah, I guess so.\nKind of undiscovered. And that's that\ncertainly comes across in her pictures.\nBut she said the people were super\nfriendly and welcoming and she just had\na really really great time. I think that\nmaybe um looking at at the articles it\nresembles Italy but has a a different\nvibe to it because it's Yeah. It's it's\ngoing back in time actually. Yeah. It\nlooks like the 1960s, isn't it? Yeah.\nYeah, it looks really Yeah. like uh\noldfashioned even. Yeah. So, uh I think\nit's uh it's uh if you want to go there,\nit probably changed uh in a couple years\ntime because things are going fast. But\nuh it it looks like uh now is the time\nto uh to go there and visit um uh\nAlbania. Um I might I might put it on my\non my list. Um uh the next one is also\non my list because uh Gruro is uh\ngetting back to Quincy, USA. Yeah. So,\nwe're going back to the States for this\nstory, but it see it was too too good a\nstory not to mention this month. Granura\nis going to be 10 next year. Uh, which\nis obviously a heck of a celebration.\nIt's it's one of the oldest established\nuh Grandur sorry, oldest established\ngravel events in the world. And they\nstarted off in Quincy in California, and\nthey're going to go back there for the\nfirst time since 2018, I think. And it's\nit just looks incredible. huge\nmountains, lots of forest, amazing\ntrails. The the team that run the event\non the ground do a lot of work of trail\nbuilding and so there's miles and miles\nand miles of incredible gravel single\ntrack. So, it's that perfect combination\nof an amazing destination, a really good\nteam, fantastic riding, and then\nobviously a big party afterwards to\ncelebrate. Uh well, it sounds like a\nlike a plan to put that on the list. Uh\nyeah, heading over to the spiritual home\nof of uh of Granduro in in Quincy. Uh we\nknow that we also um partner up with a\nfew events in uh in Europe. We do. We\ndon't know exactly how the the calendar\nwill look next year, but well, we will\nuh we will share that information with\nyou uh as soon as uh as\npossible. Um I think it's it's time to\nhead over to the main guest of the day.\nUh that's uh that's Phil. So uh we have\na special bumper for that. Here it\n[Music]\ncomes. Yeah. Here we are uh back again\nwith uh with Phil Phil Evans from the\nUK. Uh Phil, maybe you can introduce\nyourself before we start talking about\nuh exotic locations. Yes, of course. Um\nas Carla just said, um my name is Phil\nEvans. I'm founder and director of\nmulti-terrain biking, which was formerly\nknown as mountain biking terrain, but\nwe've now rebranded to encompass the\nbeautiful sport of gravel biking.\nHooray.\nYou're in the right podcast, Phil.\nYou're in the right podcast.\nUm, yeah, I'm also a self-employed\nbuilder and a co-founder of an animal\ncharity that takes cares of animals,\ncommunity animals in Sri Lanka and\nNepal. So, that's basically my life.\nYeah. Pretty busy.\nToo busy sometimes, but it's better to\nbe busy than not, isn't it? Yeah. So, I\nguess we we're going to talk today,\nPhil, about longhaul gravel particularly\nbecause we we have a variety of guests\non the podcast and sometimes we're\ntalking about fairly not mundane\ndestinations is a bit harsh, but not\nsuper exotic, but today we're going to\nthe opposite extreme. And you've spent a\nlot of your life riding in pretty\namazing locations. How did you first get\nhooked into riding outside of Europe? It\nwas a bit of a natural progression\nreally. Um, I've been involved with\nbikes from a very early age. I worked in\na bike shop from the age of 14. Then I\nmoved to Jersey in the Channel Islands\nand became manager of a bike shop over\nthere. And I've always been into\ncycling. And then when I was in Jersey,\nI sort of caught the travel bug and went\non a a\nlong a long travel without my bike. But\nyeah, I've Yeah, I've always yearned to\ncombine the two. So once the the thrill\nof just backpacking had worn off that's\nI looked towards combining cycling and\ntravel and yeah just progress from\nthere. Okay. And when was your first uh\nwhen was was your first visit to exotic\nlocations like Sri Lanka or Nepal?\nUm, if you can count Canada and Alaska\nas exotic, that would be definitely\ncount. I think date time getting a bit\nlong in the tooth now, but I think that\nwas about\n1998 when I did my first big cycling\nadventure. Um, yeah. So, so you're an\nexperienced uh veteran in uh in in in\ntraveling the world with your bike.\nYeah. Yeah. quite quite experienced. I\nwould say there's always something to\nlearn.\nBut mountain biking is your your your\nyour first love? Yeah, mountain biking.\nUm I've tried all the disciplines.\nMountain biking. I did triathlons for a\nwhile, road biking, time triing. But I\nsay, yeah, mountain biking up until\nrecently was my go-to biking.\nBut then fairly recently you've\ndiscovered gravel riding and you're now\nhooked, which is good because it means\nwe can invite you on the podcast. Yes.\nYes, of course. How did that change come\nabout? Why? Why? Cuz gravel riding's\nbeen around for 10 years at least. How\nHow come? It was a fairly recent\nconversion for you. Yeah, very recent\nreally. But um maybe only two years ago.\nSo, we were approached by Sri Lankan\nAirlines to\num help them put together a gravel bike\nand event. Um I only had one bike at the\ntime, uh a mountain bike, a full\nsuspension mountain bike, and I knew the\ntrails weren't going to be gnarly enough\nfor that. So, I just put some slick\ntires on that for the time being. And\nthen I was like totally amazed how much\nmore ground I could cover and how e\neasier the effort was than big knobbly\ntires and how much um more relaxing it\nwas than having to yeah slog\nover rocky rough\nterrain. So yeah, when I got back to the\nUK I was like that's it. I'm buying\nmyself a gravel bike and I'm going to\nstart enjoying some of the gravel trails\naround North Wales where I live.\nGreat. How did your involvement with the\nairline start? Because they're such a\nbig part of this story. We can't talk\nabout Sri Lanka without mentioning them.\nIt's not a common thing. For example, if\nyou talk to many other airlines, most of\nthem won't give two monkeys about\ncycling and they won't understand it and\nthey won't be interested beyond bums on\nseats. But Sri Lankan, it's the\nopposite. They seem super keen. So, how\ndid that all come about in the\nbeginning? Yeah, they are super keen to\num none of them are cyclists I will say\nbut they are um the head of marketing\nhas recently bought a bike to take over\nwith him but he hasn't used it but yeah\num as a company as as mountain biker\nworldwide was we were looking for a new\ndestination to take an event to we'd\nbeen in Nepal for seven eight years and\nwe was looking to expand and a friend of\nmine knew to um Sammy, the head of\nmarketing at Sri Lankan Airlines and\nsaid, \"Why don't you get in contact with\nhim to see whether they'd be\ninterested?\" So, yeah, I sent sent them\nan email and he's got straight back to\nme. And initially, they wanted to put on\na a a road cycling event. Okay. And I\nwas like, that's not really my not\nreally my forte road cycling. It's um\nyeah, but we would be interested in\nputting the mountain bike event on. And\nI don't think Sri Lanka\nreally knew what mountain biking was at\nthe time. So I went out and did some\nwreckers and they were showing me more\ngravel routes if you like. Okay. And I\nwas like, \"No, we're looking for\nsomething a bit more bit more brutal\nthan this, a bit more gnarly.\"\nSo yeah, so eventually we settled on the\nsettled on some roots and yeah, Sri\nLankan Airlines came on as a sponsor\ninitially and I think that's where they\nsort of saw the potential for different\ndisciplines as well as road cycling in\nin Sri Lanka and I guess from their\nperspective all passengers are a benefit\nto them because it brings in some money\nbut They did they target cyclists\nspecifically rather than wind surfers or\nwalkers or I don't know some other kind\nof sport that could go there. Was there\nsome link with cycling particularly or\nit was just they thought cyclists were\njust a good market to tap into? I think\num they have phases. they've they've\nalready like done a big promotion for um\nsurfers a few years ago, but I think\ncyclists bring a whole new audience or\nclientele to Sri Lanka that\nthe resort kind of clientele is already\nestablished. People that go out for\ntheir two weeks by the beach, um just\nstay at the hotel really. And apart from\nbackpackers that don't really spend that\nmuch money in Sri Lanka,\ncyclists like to explore and not be\nstaying in one place for for one or two\nnights at a time. So I think it it opens\nup a whole like if they can attract\nadventure cyclists, it opens up a whole\nnew kind of market for them as as well\nas bums on seats in the planes of\ncourse. Mhm.\nWhen you first started working out\nthere, you did a or you ran a mountain\nbike event called the Rumble in the\nJungle, which is a really super good\nname for an event. It was a very clever\nbit of marketing and it ran until 2018,\nsomething like that. Yeah. 2018. Yeah.\nAnd then switched and then you've you've\nrun an event now called um Ride Sri\nLanka last year and is that right?\n2020 23 was the pilot pilot one and then\nYeah. Yeah. And then this year it ran\nfor the first time properly and then\nnext year in in March you're going to\nrun it again which is the reason I've\njust been out there. Yeah. So can tell\nus a bit about the event for anyone that\nhasn't heard of it. What is um Ride Sri\nLanka and why should people why should\ngravel riders be interested in it? Well\nRide Sri Lanka is um much less extreme\nthan what we used to go for in previous\nyears. Um, I was all\nabout making things as uncomfortable as\npossible for everybody and as brutal as\npossible. But, um, unfortunately, not\neveryone\nsees sees fun the same way as I\ndo. So, yeah. Um, ride flank is not it's\nnot a race. It's more of an event where\nyou can ride at your own speed. Um, if\nyou want to go fast, you can. If you\nwant to go slow, you can, but it's more\nmore about um highlighting what the\ncountry has to offer. So, one of the\nrequisites of um route finding was to\ntake in some of the iconic landmarks of\nSri Lanka. Um and also to be staying at\num quality hotels which is again the\nairline are keen to um show people that\nanother side of Sri Lanka that it's not\njust like your $5 a night room. You have\ngot nice resorts and places to stay. Um,\nso it's that combination of fairly wild\nadventurous cycling, but then super posh\naccommodation each night is quite an\ninteresting combination because normally\nin an event it's one or the other. It's\neither really luxurious everything. And\nhow many days is it? Uh, Phil, how many\ndays do people ride? Um, five five days\noverall. Five days riding and then\nthey're out in Sri Lanka. Well, a\nminimum of nine nights, but of course\nthey're welcome to stay longer if they\nwant.\nAnd you you know you have the experience\nof riding you both have the experience\nof of riding in Sri Lanka. Well, you did\na route already. Uh Ollie, what you\nknow, if if you have to convince me to\ncome over, what are the highlights of of\nriding in in Sri Lanka? Um you get to\nsee a massive diversity in a a short\nspace of time. So you're starting on the\num northeast coast on like calm tranquil\nIndian\nOcean and then a day later you're going\npast the iconic um landmark of the\nSigiraa which is a the probably the most\nfamous landmark in Sri Lanka. Um this\nenormous lump of sandstone rock that\nsticks out of the plane that was turned\ninto a fortress in 17 something or other\n18 something or other. And you can you\nclimb up the side on ladders and steps\ncarved out of the stone to get to the\ntop. And it's just it's it's very hard\nto describe unless you've seen it, but\nit's absolutely incredible. Yeah, it's\nprobably the image that comes up if\neveryone imagines Sri Lanka really. But\nthen yeah, from there we head into the\num hill country. So you you're starting\nin 40 30 to 40\u00b0 heat. When you get into\nNurellia at 1800 meters, you could be\ndown to 5\u00b0 and in mist like can feel\nquite cold. You're in then you through\ntea plantation\nterritory. Yeah, that I think that is\nthe the biggest draw card is the is the\ndiversity and with\ncycling we we get to you we get to see a\nside of Sri Lanka that your mainstream\ntourism. We go through villages that\nmainstream tourism will hardly ever\ntouch. So you get Yeah. It's And it's\nsuch a The locals are so happy to see\npeople going through there. It's just so\nheartwarming really. I think that's\nprobably the bit that sticks in my brain\nthe most is how friendly and welcoming\neverybody is. They they do a double take\nwhen you cycle through because they've\nhalf them have never seen sport cyclists\nbefore and you turn up and you can see\nthem go and then instantly after they\ngot over the shock then they smile and\nevery all the the the kids particularly\nare just amazing. They're so friendly\nand happy and they they've all learned\nsome English at school. in there. So,\nthey all say hi as you're cycling along,\nwhich is really funny. Or come on, come\non, come on, if you're going up a steep\nclimb. And it's it's incredible that\nthat welcome is it's really uh I think\nthat's the bit sticks in my brain the\nmost. It's a complete different from\nbeing in the UK with\nBut yeah, you get the hello by in the\none sentence.\nAnd how how long are the stages? Um so\nwe've got various\num different distances on each day to\ntry and cater for a wide um ability of\npeople. So for instance the first day\nyou can ride 132k is the maximum or 50k\nis the shortest. Then we got one in\nbetween the two and each day is round\nabout that varies depends how many hills\nare in the way or uh whether it's flat\nor not. So you're really aiming at like\na like a the biggest target audience as\npossible. If people want to go, they\nthey can accommodate well to their\nwishes and and and do like a shorter\nroute or a longer one. Yeah. Because\nthat's one of the big advantages of\nbeing under the umbrella of um the\nnational carrier of Sri Lanka is they\ncan pull up the support from practically\nany avenue. We have the air force, the\npolice, the It's nice. Yeah. The support\nfor the event is everyone who's ever\nbeen on a Sri Lankan Airlines event is\nlike just amazed by the amount of like\nsupport there is.\nSo there really is like the the\nthe underlying and there's also\nobviously like it's it's an it's an\nairline so they want to they want to\nsell sell tickets but they also want to\nshare the uh the country with uh you're\ngoing to see the real Sri Lanka if you\nyeah they're all all the all the\nmarketers are really passionate about\npeople they don't just want them to be\nriding their bikes for 12 hours a day\nand head down and just get to the hotel\nnext day. Yeah, riding again. They want\nthem and they put on um kind\nof\nextra\nextra activities like like say it says\nyou can climb Sigaria that would be an\noption and then if there's time in the\nevenings go to see the elephants or so\nthey try and utilize the amount of the\nutilize your time there to the best\nin your time working now with the with\nthe gravel community. Yeah. Gravel. Do\nyou feel that uh they they uh is there a\ndifferent vibe to it than than a\nmountain bike scene? Are they more\ninclined to to uh to do an event like\nthat? Uh to get to get out there to to\nreally see the country, meet the people.\nYeah. I think\num a lot more relaxed than mountain\nbikers, I would say. That's what we\nthat's what we like to hear also. But\nthat's what we hear a lot, you know.\nYeah.\nUm, yeah, and more I haven't had that\nmuch experience because obviously I've\nonly worked on two gravel biking events\nso far, but and the first one was a\ngroup of elite endurance riders, but\nfrom last year from the 24 the when it\nwas open to the public was such a good u\nmix of people. Um, and even\nnow almost 8 months later, there's still\na WhatsApp group chat with people. Some\nof them were mountain bikers to start\nwith. Um, but yeah, they're all Yeah,\nit's like a big family now. And it's\nYeah, it's it's good. It's It's\nrewarding to see that. And\nthat's nice to hear, isn't it? That the\nthe gravel riders are a good community.\nYeah. Yeah.\nWe're proud of that.\nShould we move on next then? So we've\ntalked about Sri Lanka which is\nincredible but you're also doing another\nevent next year in Nepal which is\nperhaps even more incredible. Talk to us\nabout your history in of riding in Nepal\nfirst of all. So riding history. Yeah.\nUm I've been going to Nepal since what\nshould I say\n1989 90 I would say. Wow. Um but not\nwith a not with a bike then. Um but\nduring my years in Nepal, I came across\nan article on\num Everest Marathon and although I'm not\nmuch of a runner, it kind of piqu my\ninterest and I thought I need to do\nthat. So, but it wasn't until about 10\nyears later that I had the opportunity\nto be able to enter it and do it. But\nsoon as I started on it, I was like,\nthis format could really work for for\nmountain biking. the\num tea houses, the like traveling\nbetween the tea houses, there's always\nsomewhere to stay, but it's also really\nremote. So, yeah. So, that was back in\nwhen did I 2003 I did the Everest\nMarathon and then that's got me thinking\nabout a mountain biking event, even\nthough I'd never been involved in any\nkind of events before,\njust mechanics basically. or shop\nmanagement. But yeah, I got back and\nthought, \"Yeah, that'd be really really\ncool.\" I got quite a good connection\nwith Nepal already by then because I've\nbeen out quite a few few times. So, I\nsent a few emails out to different\num companies with the idea of putting on\nthe mountain bike event and yeah, it\nwent it escalated from there, should we\nsay. Great. And you've obviously got a\nknack for getting a good name because\nthe the mountain bike runs called the\nYakat attack which is is absolutely\ninfamous in the mountain bike community\nfor being so incredible scenery and a\nreal challenge. I mean the Torangla pass\nis higher than the highest mountain in\nEurope and the riders have to go over it\nas part of the event. So it's it's it's\npretty tough, isn't it? Oh, it's Yeah.\nYeah. It's pretty extreme which\nis yeah it makes um hard work for the\nfor the logistics I can imagine but it\ndoes make it a yeah like you say an\niconic event amongst the mountain biking\nworld but also\nuh scary for a lot of people even though\nit's it's well I'm saying it's not I've\nbeen over 15 times now and it's old hat\nbut I suppose for a lot of people\nthinking about going to 5,400 m. It is\nquite\na a big step to take. And is that one of\nthe uh kind of factors behind creating\nthe Trans Nepal for next year then doing\na slightly softer version of of the\narchitect? So still cycling, still\nremote but not quite as gnarly. Yeah.\nWell, yeah. Um again, transgression into\ngravel biking. Um the Anipona circuit\nalthough people have done it on gravel\nbikes I I can't see that it would be\nmuch fun on a gravel bike. There's too\nmany steps aren't there just millions\nand millions and millions of steps. So\nyeah\num I was look I was again looking to\nbring more more uh cyclist to Nepal and\nwith gravel biking now in our minds. I\nwas trying to looking at routes where\nwhere we could do gravel biking and the\nthe one the Trans Nepal just stood out\nlike massively stood out for for the\nterrain and for the again diversity of\nwhat's on offer there. Do you want to\ntalk a little bit about the the event\nthen? What what would it include and\nwhere does it go? partly because that's\nas soon as I saw it, I was instantly\nhooked within about 10 seconds just\nbecause of where it starts. But for\nanybody that doesn't know of it, what's\nwhat's the event all about? So\nyeah, it starts the the actual ride in\nproper starts in a place called Lantang\nwhich is the if you like capital but not\nhow you would imagine a capital to be of\nupper Mustang which is the kind of I\nsuppose\nnorth mid region of Nepal. It's uh it's\nonly been open to foreigners since I\nthink 82 I think.\nUm and it's a very uh yeah restricted\narea. Tourism isn't hasn't hit the\nmainstream yet. It's quite um still as\nit was and it's a completely different\nterrain to the rest of Nepal. It looks\nmore Tibetan, doesn't it? more more than\ntypical kind of Nepali that you might\npicture on a postcard. The big um\nBuddhist influence is a lot of Buddhist\nstupers and monasteries and most of the\nyou'll see the most locals sat around\ncounting the the mandala beads. Um and\nit's a\nmuch yeah it sits in the in the should\nwe in the rain shadow. So it's a very\ndry dry landscape.\nUm, not as there's a lot of climbing\ninvolved in Upper Mustang, but it's not\nas steep or as brutal as the maybe\nlonger longer climbs, but not as brutal\nclimbs, if you know. And probably not so\ntechnically challenging either. It's\nslightly It's more kind of gravel\nterrain, isn't it? But just\nsignificantly higher than most\nWesterners would have ridden it. Yeah.\nYeah. Luckily for us, the Chinese have\nbeen in and forged a massive gravel road\nfrom China to well right through upper\nMustang to the to the lower Mustang\nborder where then joins the the highway\ndown well not the highway but the track\ndown to\nthe lowlands really. So although it's a\nbit sad in one way that it's that\nthere's a big massive road going through\nthere, it is it's a gravel road and\nwe're going to we're going to utilize\nit. Yeah, absolutely. The appeal of\ngoing to Mustang is the bit that sold it\nto me, I have to say, just because so\nfew people can go there and it's it's\nincredibly wild and remote, but just\nit's an unbelievably beautiful\nlandscape. And if you're into mountains\nand you're into gravel riding, it ticks\nall the boxes. It I The first time I\nwent, I was amazed at the change of\nlandscape just from crossing the the\npath into Upper Mustang and then it's\njust like it's like being in a different\ncountry but like 10 kilometers away from\nwhere you were originally.\nIt's quite a small scale event, isn't\nit, this one? So you're going to limit\nthe numbers to because it's so wild and\nremote and it's you don't want to spoil\nthe landscape. Yeah. Tell tell us a bit\nabout the the kind of practicalities.\nHow do you manage an event where where\nyou're taking people somewhere that's\nthree days drive from anywhere and then\nlook after them and they're at 5,000\nmeters? What what do you kind of do\nbehind the scenes to make sure it's all\ndone in a safe manner? Obviously, we\nhave to the one of the major concerns\nwith being at altitude is altitude\nsickness. Mhm. Um and anything over\n2,800 m you could that's when the when\nit starts it can start. So yeah, one of\nour major things is to have medics,\ndoctors that are qualified in\num treatment and diagnosis of altitude\nsickness. All riders have to have\ninsurance that will cover them for\nhelicopter evacuation.\nUm and then yeah, it's just a um it's a\nmatter of keeping track of everybody\nthat they don't get don't get lost in\nthe wilderness. So yeah, keeping tabs at\neach water station and yeah,\nmainly keep Yeah. keeping just making\nsure everyone's on track and Okay.\nYeah. water station is a good link into\nthe next bit of our conversation and you\ndo a lot of work with charities as part\nof your events and in Nepal particularly\nyou work with a water charity don't you\nto try and reduce the amount of plastic\nwaste so do you want to tell us a little\nbit about that yeah we've been working\nwith um\nthe the founder of smart pne is a um\nAmerican guy called Tyler McMman and\nhe's been he came on the very first, no,\nmaybe the second Yak\nattack and it came for the next six\nyears, but it wasn't until about uh\nfive, six years ago that they had the\nthe equipment to be able to do kind of\nremote water filtration. But now that's\nwhat we Yeah. Every every event we do\nnow, we work with Smart Pney to um they\nsupply us with the water filters and\nthen the volunteers are trained up how\nhow to use the filters and it it reduces\nthe amount of plastic\nwe use well down to nothing really.\nGreat. Which is Yeah. Which\nis one of one of the plights of the\nHimalayas is the use of plast single use\nplastic really. So anything we can do to\nreduce that\nis fantastic. You do a lot of work with\nthe or a lot of your staff and your\nvolunteers in Napoli as well, aren't\nthey? Rather than furrying Westerners\nout there and is that again part of\ntrying to have as a big a positive\nimpact as possible as you can? Yes.\nWell, yeah, we like I say, I mean, I've\nbeen going to Nepal for countless years\nnow, and I've lots of friends in the\ncycling community.\nUm, and their only source of work really\nis guiding or working in shops.\nSo, if we\ncan give them at least a guaranteed\ncouple of weeks work twice a year with\nour\nevents as opposed to\num taking foreign volunteers out there,\nthen that that's got to be beneficial.\nUm\nand yeah, yeah, we we try well, we don't\ntry we do pay them above the rates that\nthey would do if they were working for a\nfor a travel company.\nAnd it gives them an opportunity because\nthey're all cyclists that that that\nvolunteer or it's\nvolunteer work. They're all cyclist. So\nit gives them an opportunity to\nintegrate with\num international riders, foreign riders,\nand maybe forge some relationships where\nthey they're supported into the future\nor invited out to the country. And\nthat's happened on quite a few occasions\nnow. Great. It is it's one of the uh the\nelephant in the room I guess about doing\nlonghaul riding is the the the negative\nenvironmental impact of it and uh one of\nthe things that you do with Sri Lankan\nAirlines is or one of the things they\nare keen on is to try and reduce their\nimpact. So can you tell us a bit about\nthat? Yeah, they yeah they're really\nkeen um on reducing their their impact.\nUm, for one example, last year I wanted\nuh everybody to take a tuk tuk up to\nLipton Seat and then ride their bikes\ndown from there. And the airline were\nlike, \"No, that's not um very\nenvironmentally friendly.\" But what\nthey're doing as a company is um they're\nreplanting mangrove forests in the\nlagoon near um\nNambo and I think doing something with\nsea kelp and both these are both these\nare meant to sequester carbon at a much\nhigher rate than any terrestrial forest.\nSo I think that's the avenue they're\ngoing down is to try and develop these\nmangrove and sea kelp\nplantations to kind of offset a little\nbit. Is there things that the individual\nriders can do as well do you think to\nreduce their own impact or to even if\nnot to reduce the impact but to make a\npositive benefit on where they go? Um\nthat's a good question. Um I mean even\ninteraction with local people is if you\ndo it in the right way makes a real\nbenefit doesn't it to both you educate\nthe riders and hopefully you introduce\nthe the local uh people to to western\nriders you get that kind of cross\nfertilization of cultures and Yeah.\nYeah. I was going to say\num I know like air travel's not the best\nfor the environment but if we didn't\ntravel it would be a very insular insula\nworld and I think in my opinion the\npeople who travel frequently are more\nempathetic. People that travel\nfrequently and experience different\ncultures and different environments are\nmore empathetic and with other\num nationalities,\nother different people different from\nthemselves really. Yeah. So I think that\nthat is the biggest\nbenefit of um international travel is is\nthe broadening of your\num empathy for other people.\nBut I I agree and I it's also it seems I\nthink that's the challenge of this time\nis that it's always hard to get the\nright balance between okay okay okay we\ndo things that are not really\nenvironmental friendly but on the other\nhand we bring people together. Um, we\nsee that also in the gravel community\nbecause it's it's really one of the\ntopics that's that's also on the on on\nthe agenda\nthere. Well, everybody has to find a way\nto to to to get that b balance and yeah,\nif I could encourage everybody to cycle\nto our events, I would, but not everyone\ncan get that amount of time off work.\nWell, and also I think it starts with\nthe discussion like we have you know\nit's\nit's yeah it's uh it's good to talk\nabout it and uh you know there are\ndownsides and upsides but uh yeah\nthere's never a a\nperfect perfect solution for the Napoli\ntrip particularly there's a lot of\nfinancial benefits the local community\nisn't there if you're staying in tea\nhuts the money's going straight into the\nlocal economy it's not going to some big\ncorporation somewhere So that's that's a\nreal tangible benefit of of tourism\ngoing through. Yeah. Especially like the\nTrans Nepal where it's running outside\nthe main tourist season. So it'll be\nproviding income to a lot of the T\nhouses that would not be doing any\nbusiness that time of year.\nOkay. Now, we're going to ask, seeing as\nyou're a welltraveled man, we're going\nto ask your uh expertise. If you if say\nfor someone that's never traveled\noutside Europe and they're going to do a\n14-hour flight to Sri Lanka or they're\ngoing to do a long journey to to to\nMustang is a long journey, isn't it?\nFrom from the UK, for example, is there\nanything you would recommend to make\ntheir travel less tiring or more\npleasant or uh how can they make it as\nenjoyable as possible? What do you do?\nYeah. What's your top tips for long haul\ntravel? I'd say forearmmed is\nforewarned. For all our trips, we try we\nwell we don't try. We do send out like a\ncomprehensive\num information pack if you like that\num tries to give as much firsthand\ninformation as possible about what to\nexpect at the airport.\nUm because that's a big shock for people\nespecially um Catmand do. Catmand do is\nbonkers isn't it? When you come out of\nthe airport and it's you feel like\nyou've landed on an alien planet\nsomewhere. So if you got that if you're\narmed with that information and you know\nwhat little bit what to expect it's not\nso much of a shock to um to the system.\nUm,\nyeah. No, I think that's that's the main\nthing that can help you is to know a\nlittle bit of what to expect so you're\nnot you're not on you're not on a knife\nedge all the time of wondering oh what\nwhy is that happening? What's what's\ngoing on there? What what do I do?\nOkay. You put on your website for the\ntrans Nepal about learning to love\nDalbat as well. So what is Dalbat first\nof all for anybody that hasn't had it\nand why should riders on the trip why\nshould they love it? Dalbat is the the\nstaple meal of Nepal. It's um is\na a veggie version which is rice dal\ncurry and um uh vegetable curry and some\npickles and maybe a papadam if you're\nlucky. And then the nonveg version is\nyou'll either get chicken or what they\ncall mutton which is normally goat curry\nwith it.\nUm most Nepal no nearly all Nepalies eat\nthis twice a day without fail at 10:00\nin the morning and 8:00 at night round\nabout. If you take them out for a meal\nnormally they'll plump the forbat. it\nyou can you take them to an\ninternational restaurant whether you\nhave pizza or pasta or whatever they\njust love they love dbat it's yeah so\nit's um and it is a really good meal to\nfor a cyclist to have high carb it's um\nsafe it's not spicy when I say curry\nit's not a spicy curry it's just mildly\nflavored\num yeah and it's a good all round meal I\nsuppose you got your carbs You got your\nvegetables, you got your protein and\nyour lentils and your dal. So yeah, one\nof the things I heard as well is that\nit's from a um food safety perspective,\nthe fact that Nepalese people\npractically live on it. They cook it the\nwhole time. They know how to do it\nperfectly and it's the turnover is\nreally fast. So the stuff's going to be\nfresh. It's not going to have been\nsitting there for two days before you\neat it because they get through so much.\nSo when I first went to Nepal, I was\nadvised to eat it just from a keeping\nyour stomach safe perspective that it's\nand also there was an environmental bit\nof that as well that because they're\nmaking it in such big volume, they don't\nneed to cook it specially that so they\ndon't need so much gas or they don't\nneed so much firewood because they're\ngoing to be making a big pot of it\nanyway. So it it ticks lots of boxes,\ndoesn't it? Infernite. It does. It is.\nUm every time I go on the ball, I\nconvince myself I'm going to live on\nDalbat entirely. But yeah, it's I've\nnever been able to manage to do it yet.\nAt some point it's like, oh, I'm just\ncraving something that's not down.\nThat was one of the things that blew me\naway last week in Sri Lanka is how good\nthe food is. And I think from from a\nrers's perspective there, you're staying\nin in very nice accommodation and the\nfood is just exceptional. everything\nfrom even the airline food. As soon as\nyou you check in, it was the nicest\nairline food I've ever had and it just\nwent the whole way until I came home.\nSo, what was the best meal you had uh in\nSri Lanka? Probably fish because they\nthey do such a lot of it. There's all\nsorts tuned, really good shellfish,\namazing prawns, but the I had loads. The\ncurry was really great and there there's\nhuge variety, so you can you can have\nreally whatever you want. one one day\nfor lunch. I was absolutely starving\nbecause it did a huge day and we stopped\nin a little tiny village in the middle\nof nowhere and there was one place open\nthat that had a what they called a\nbuffet but I think we'd been their only\nvisitors that day and the choice was\ncurry curry or curry but it was it was\nsuper good and it was it was very local.\nI don't think they'd had any western\ntourists in there ever. So it was quite\nquite eye opening with the hotels are a\nbit more western so there is there\nthere's a good choice of food. Yeah,\nit's so hard not to put on weight on the\nSri Lankan events. But the woman is you\ncould you could absolutely come home\nwearing kilos and kilos more because the\nbuffets are just like, \"Oh, I just try a\nbit of that.\" Or I'll just have some of\nthat bit of cake. Just one more bit of\ncake or Yeah. Yeah.\nWhat else is on our list to talk about?\nColors. Uh we talk about a bike actually\nfor two seconds, Phil. Yeah, they're\nquite different trips. The the Napoli\none is very high. It's um there's long\nlong climbs on it and some of it's quite\nrough. Sri Lanka in comparison, the\nfirst couple of days at least are pretty\nsmooth and there's there's a lot of what\nwe would call champagne gravel in the\nUK. There is some gnarly bits in the\nmiddle, but the I guess some of them are\noptional. Um so if you were going to go\nfor let's do Sri Lanka first of all.\nWhat would be the ideal setup do you\nthink for for your ride Sri Lanka trip?\nI'd say\num\nyeah one by\n11 by 12 obviously now cuz Shimano have\nbrought it out recently. Oh 1x 12\nsorry 1 by 12. Um I don't know 40 40C\nplus tires. Yeah.\nUm something that you can create a\nbreeze with. Yeah it was plenty hot.\nYeah. Yeah. Something that you can carry\na couple of water bottles on. Yeah. Um\nbut yeah, I wouldn't say any kind of\nsuspension would be necessary for Sri\nLanka. No, like you say, it's pretty\npretty there are a couple of gnarly\nsections, but they can be ridden around.\nI think my advice would be to have a\ngood climbing gear because you'd one of\nthe days I can't remember which day it\nwas but one of them had some really\nsteep ramps at the end that were 20%\nplus and although they're dead short\nthey were blooming steep and I was very\nhappy that I had a good climbing\ngear. But did you take your bike uh\nOllie or Yeah, I took took my own\nbecause that's also for international\ntravel. It's always people are always a\nlittle hesitant of should I take the\nbike? Should I should I should I have a\na bike rental there? What would your\nadvice be? Uh, Phil, I for Sri Lanka\ndefinitely take your own bike. Um, bike\nrental is very\num primitive, shall we say? you won't\nyou won't be able to hire a gravel bike\nin Sri Lanka and you'd\nbe lucky to find a quality like mountain\nbike even. So definitely for Sri Lanka\nplus if anyone's going out for us one of\nthe Sri Lankan Airlines events the\nairline give them 40 kilos as standard.\nSo you haven't got you haven't got to\nworry about the excess luggage. Okay.\nWell that's interesting. But Nepal the\num yeah the the market for higher bikes\nis much bigger. So\nreally but it's all always nice to ride\nyour own your own bike. It's always\nYeah. You never I hired a bike for\nYakatak last year and the brakes were\nthe wrong way around. Not the wrong way\naround, but the other way around to what\nI'm used to and I didn't bother changing\nthem. And then I uh fell off within the\nfirst 20 km and broke a rib. So, but I\ndon't think that would have happened if\nI'd have been on my own bike. I'd have\nbeen like, yeah, more in control. So,\nthere's pros and cons. What it's nice\nnot to travel with a bike. Every time I\ntake my bike away, I'm like until it's\nloaded on the plane, I'm like, this is a\nright pain. But and how about spare\nspare products? Like is it do you need\nto bring your own spare uh materials or\nis it mechanics around at your events or\nYeah, we got mechanics at both events.\nUm if there's anything like bespoke for\nyour bike then you more than you\nprobably won't get that in Sri Lanka.\nYou might get it in Nepal, but I would\nsay bring a mech hanger if nothing else.\nIf the mech hanger breaks, you're\nabsolutely scupppered.\nbrake pads. You can probably borrow some\noff a friend or in a tube or whatever.\nYou can do tubeless plugs is easy, but a\nmech hanger. It's unique. Good advice.\nGood advice. That's Yeah.\nWhat about for the Nepali trip? What\nkind of bike would you recommend there?\nBecause it's obviously a lot higher and\na lot a lot longer climbs. Yeah. Um not\na lot of difference. I think a bit lower\ngear lower geared than Sri Lanka I'd\nsay.\nmaybe cuz the descents are a lot\nobviously the climbs are longer descents\nare longer as well.\nMaybe some kind of stem or fork\nsuspension\nor bigger volume tires. Bigger volume\ntires. Yeah. Yeah. Go go go that way.\nUm nothing too heavy cuz obviously the\nthe climbs are very long. The less\nweight you hauling up the the better.\nHow how long is the longest climb then?\nCuz is\nit in\nNepal you you'll be climbing for hours\nor could be climbing for like some of\nthem are probably up to 12 13 14k. Okay.\nSo yeah although it's predominant speed\nas well some of them. Yeah. Yeah.\nAlthough the most of the majority of\nclimbing is when we get into the\nfoothills. There's one big day in the\nfoothills where\num where we're at about 2,000 meters,\nbut there's about I think off the top of\nmy head 4,000 m of climbing. So, wow.\nYeah. So, I'd say yeah, definitely\nsomething very low with as lower gear as\nyou can get. Okay.\nAnd maybe even uh bring a change of\ntires because the terrain will alter\nfrom the from between upper Mustang and\nwhen you get into Tai you could probably\nride slightly less volume tires once\nyou're in the Tai.\nOkay. Right. Two more questions for you\nPhil. The first one is what's the one\nthing you wouldn't be without traveling?\nObviously not including your passport\nbecause that's we just assume you're\ngoing to have that with you. What's your\none thing you have to take wherever you\ngo? It's not very useful for anybody\nelse, but it's a photo of my\ndog. He's one of he's the thing he's the\nthing I miss the most when I'm\ntraveling. So, I need to I need to um\nYeah, keep him in mind.\nGreat. Carlo, do you want to do the last\nquestion? Yeah, we have uh the standard\nuh last question. So, we always finished\nfinish off with this one. Uh, if we if\nwe put you on a desert island and you\ncould only take one kind of bike with\nyou, what uh would it be and why? Would\nyou tell me what the terrain of the\ndesert island was before you dropped me\noff?\nHow mountainous is that? It's the first\nthe first time that we get that we get a\nquestion back on this. It's a clever\nquestion\nbecause that obviously wouldn't\ninfluence my choice.\nIt might. It might, but then I suppose\nif you're saying desert island, I'm\nenvisaging flats and sand and palm tree.\nSo, I still I still hear the mountain\nbiker in you. Uh, Phil, well, I'm going\nprobably I'd tell um fat bike. I was\ngoing to say you were heading towards a\nfat bike then. I could see that. I've\nnever ridden one, but I'm envisioning\nthat would be the ideal form of\ntransport for a desert island. If you're\nriding on the sand, it make a lot of\nsense. Yeah. Yeah. That's Well, that's a\nthat's a it's a clever choice. Thank\nyou. Nobody's ever said that before. No.\nNo. We always force people into gravel\nbike as an answer. But if it had a dyno\nhub, that would be even better. So,\nbecause you generate a bit of\nelectricity in the evenings as well. Oh,\nclever. You thought this through. I have\nthought it through. Yeah, I This is the\nmost original answer we we we got in all\nour podcasts. So, Phil, thank you for\nthat. That's good. That's good news.\nWell, um maybe that was the last\nquestion, but if you have another one uh\nlined up, Ollie, or should we head over\nto the the infamous outro? So, there we\ngo.\nPerfect. Well, thank you very much uh\nfor\njoining in this month's edition of\nGravel Union Talks.

      "transcript": "I'm about to go on the biggest ride of\nmy life\nhere at Grindurro Scotland.\nIn fact, that's like twice as far as\nI've ever ridden in my entire life.\nSo good. Oh my god, this is so steep.\nWe'll never make that. Yeah. So, I'm not\ngoing to lie, this is going to be a\nreally big test, but I'm not doing it\nalone. Yes. Riding epics like this is in\nmy DNA. And Martin, don't worry because\nI am here to help you make it through\nthis challenging event. You guys will\nhave seen me taking on massive\nchallenges, 24-hour races, helped Blake\nthrough the Swiss Epic, but now's my\nchance to help Martin, and it's going to\nbe tough. He's doing 100 km. Martin,\nyou've been pro for over 30 years, and\nyou've never been flipping mountain\nbike. You never really done any\ndistance. No, distance has just never\nbeen my thing, dude. You know, trials\nriders, we actually don't ride very far.\nGrinduro is a is an enduro race, which\nis a format I'm very familiar with, but\non gravel bikes and over a humongous\nloop. So, the there are two loops, a 50\nand 100k. And within that are four\nstages, and those and the stages are\ntimed much like a normal enjoy race. You\ngot a start point and a finish point.\nAnd there's lots of different types of\nstages. A crazy uphill stage, a slightly\nmore downhill one, or one which was\nreally single tracky. And then those\nthose times are added up all together.\n[Music]\n&gt;&gt; Dude, I think it goes that way.\n&gt;&gt; I think you're pointing the wrong way.\n&gt;&gt; This is going to go bad.\n&gt;&gt; This is it then, Mark. Here\nwe go then. This is beautiful.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, my arm's gone.\n&gt;&gt; No,\n&gt;&gt; this is it. We head off into the abyss\nof the day.\n&gt;&gt; The old arm's gone. That's it. Let's\nturn round. Dude, we tried. No one can\nsay we didn't try. We've been dropped\nalready.\n&gt;&gt; We're at the back. We're literally lost.\nSo, my riding career started back in the\nearly '9s in mountain biking, but I'd\nbeen a motorcycle trials rider for quite\na while before then, about a decade. And\nthen I progressed into mountain bike\ntrials, which is a very niche side of\nthe sport. Um, and then that progressed\ninto being like a show rider, where I do\nlike stunt shows effectively. Uh and\nthat's where I really got on well um in\nterms of like a career path, magazine\nshoots, videos. Uh and then as the uh\nworld of YouTube dawned,\nuh I blossomed into a man who makes\nsilly videos on the internet. Um I guess\nI'm still doing that.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, we're going graveling already, are\nwe?\n&gt;&gt; We're on to the gravel already. Oh,\n&gt;&gt; sick. Oh, we keep it.\n&gt;&gt; Oh my god, it's bumpy. Yeah, said the\nman bike\nendurance.\nUm, well, back in the day riding a\ntrials competition, yeah, there is\nendurance in that in the sense that\nyou're doing lots of very short sprint\ntype efforts.\num anorobic efforts um over a long\nperiod, so like 5 hours and you keep\ndoing that. So there is a type of\nendurance, but if you're referring to\nlike mountain biking endurance, no, not\nmy wheelhouse.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, this is this must be gravel then.\n&gt;&gt; This is gravel now.\n&gt;&gt; It's really bumpy.\n&gt;&gt; Very bumpy.\n&gt;&gt; I am on the bumpy bit.\n[Applause]\nI wonder I wonder when we get to our\nfirst stage. I totally forgot we got\nstages.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's it's not just a big ride.\nThere's four sections to race within\nthis. Oh my lord.\nWe're coming to our first stage. bridge.\n&gt;&gt; So, do we get to have a big old rest? It\nlooks that way.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, sick. So, my accident took place in\none of those stunt shows I was talking\nabout. Um, yeah, just made a really\nquite normal mistake, but that had quite\nhigh consequence. Landed,\nfolded myself in two, snapped my back.\nUm, paralyzed from the waist down. uh\nyou can simply understand it as in no\nfeeling, sensation, movement of any kind\nbelow that point. And yeah, that\nobviously had a big impact on how I live\nmy life. Um but it's also led me to do\nsome things that I could never have\nimagined. Um and be challenged in a way\nI haven't ever imagined. Um and I've\nbeen doing that ever since.\n&gt;&gt; Stage one, the race begins. Richard,\nyou're in trouble now.\nYou fly downhill. I know that.\n&gt;&gt; Is this Are they all downhill?\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; Good luck, Mark.\n&gt;&gt; See you in a mo.\nWell, this is it then. Stage one of\ngritty gringuro.\nThat's a lot of uphill. This isn't a\ndownhill stage at all.\nAli got up. Rich is catching me up.\nHe's running out of energy. Uh-oh.\nOh, it's a big hill to go up. Oh, I was\ncatching him.\nHow long is this stage? Jesus.\nOh, his climb at the end is killer.\nI did not see this coming.\nOh, wow. This is longer than I thought.\nThank you. And we're done.\nThat's the end of the stage.\nThank you.\nHow you doing? Oh,\n&gt;&gt; that was tough, wasn't it?\n&gt;&gt; There was a little climb in the middle I\njust wasn't ready for.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, a little punch.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; That's a warm up. Nice one, bud.\n&gt;&gt; It's really good fun, though.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. It's a\n&gt;&gt; It's fun being on the clock a little\nbit.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz it pushes you on a bit.\nOtherwise, you're a bit like\n&gt;&gt; brightens it up a bit.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. My competitive side suddenly\nkicked in.\n&gt;&gt; You went fly past. I was like, \"Oh man,\nhere.\" And on there was a little\ndownhill just after he passed me and I\nthought, \"Oh my god, I'm going to be\nable to pass him back.\" And then there\nwas a\n&gt;&gt; a long drag. Long drag.\n&gt;&gt; I was like, \"Oh, he's gone.\"\n&gt;&gt; I think it's time we checked out the\nsteeds we'll be riding. Now, I have gone\nfor an out andout gravel thoroughbred of\na bike. The propane Terrell CF.\nThis is the Bowhead RX and I've got it\nkitted out with 24 wheels up front. I\ngot a 27.5 Mazer on the back. Now, this\nthing is an absolute weapon. For a\nstart, it's got room for up to a 50 mil\ntire, two bottle cages as standard, and\none of the sort of crowning pieces in\nit, if you like, is the inframe storage,\nwhich I should be making the most of\nwith snacks and a few tools and things\nlike that. It's got incredible braking,\nand of course, I'm powering it with my\narms, but I've got assistance. It's\nessentially a Bosch ebike, so it gives\nme a chance on some of these huge climbs\nand distance to get this ride done. When\nit comes to gearing, I've gone for a\n1x12 setup to kind of keep things\nsimple. It's a mixture of Stram's GX and\nApex group set. So, it's a GX rear mech\nwith Apex cranks and brake calipers and\nshifters up the top there. 10 x 50 out\nback, 40 to chain ring. And well, I\nthink that should do the job. I'm I'm\nquite confident in that kind of setup\nthat I'll be able to get up or down\nanything that's necessary. It looks a\nlittle bit strange compared to the\nnormal bike, but there's lots of\nfamiliar things like the braking, the\ngear system, there's a derailer at the\nback. There's just two chains in between\ngetting the power to that back wheel.\nWheel and tire combo is essential. So,\nI've gone for a Reynolds G700 black\nlabel wheel set, Victoria Airliner\ninserts, and I've got Victoria Terrano\nT70 tires, 700x 45C. Now, this, like I\nsaid, can take up to a 50. These are\npretty norbly. I don't know a huge\namount about gravel tires, but these\nones look like they're going to be\nabsolutely bang on. And with inserts as\nwell, I'm still going to ride it pretty\nhard. 35 PSI out back, 32 PSI up front.\nIt's quite simply the best hand bike in\nthe world. And I'm not just saying that.\nOther finishing kit when it comes to the\nbike. Well, let's start at the front.\nGarmin Edge 1050 computer. Big old\nscreen on it. Nice clear direction so we\ncan see where we're going with plenty of\ntime in advance. An Urggon SM men's team\nsaddle with the carbon rails in a wide.\nI use that on a lot of my epic rides and\ncross country bikes. It's a comfy\nsaddle, so I always use that one. and\nGarmin's XC rally pedals down below.\nPower meter pedals synced up to the head\nunit so I can keep an eye on the output\nthat we're doing and my output and make\nsure Martin don't go too hard at the\nbeginning. And one more thing, the\nBowhead RX has got articulation.\nSo when I'm in them loose grally\ncorners, I got double front wheel for\nmore grip and more speed.\nOo\n&gt;&gt; yeah. Right.\n&gt;&gt; Lunch break.\n&gt;&gt; Go on then. What have you got there?\n&gt;&gt; Cuz my bag is actually a bit too heavy.\nIt keeps falling out.\n&gt;&gt; We got to thin it out.\n&gt;&gt; So I I literally brought a lunch box.\n&gt;&gt; No. At no point.\n&gt;&gt; Feel the weight of the lunch box.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's why it keeps falling. At no\npoint on an epic ride have I ever taken\na lunch box with me. A ride like this\nneeds a really great nutrition plan, and\nI have got that covered because I'm\neight weeks into a keto diet. It's\nrecommended to consume between 60 to 90\ng of carbs per hour and about 500 mil of\nliquid with electrolytes in. Keto diet\nis essentially high fat, moderate\nprotein, and no carbs. Carbs, yuck. I\nshall be doing this via bars. Pork\nscratchins. Gel's got some Serrano ham\nand fruit. Some cheese. 12 boiled eggs.\nRich is going to be so pleased with me.\nNow, would you like a bit of cheese\nfirst? You're going to go with an egg?\n&gt;&gt; No. I don't want to deprive you though.\n&gt;&gt; I should stop. We need to make it laugh.\n&gt;&gt; Oh my god.\nMartin is doing exactly what I thought\nmight happen and has bombed it off. He's\nessentially got too excited because of\nthe first stage and is now zooming\naround the woods somewhere ahead of me.\nThis could turn out to be quite fatal in\nthe long run. So, we'll try and reel him\nin and calm him back down.\nLittle update time. We sort of had a a\nrealization. We're getting a bit carried\naway. Martin's battery is lower than we\nthought. So, we're at 30% battery on\nMartin's bike, but we're not quite Well,\nwe're past the halfway point to where\nthe other batteries are, but it's going\nto be very touch and go, isn't it? We've\ngot about 15k to do on 30% battery\n&gt;&gt; with a stage in there and quite a lot of\nclimbing.\n&gt;&gt; I've toned it down though. I'm right\ndown in ecoy mode.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Battery kind of What's the word?\nBattery management.\n&gt;&gt; Battery management moment.\n&gt;&gt; It's crucial right now.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, uh\n&gt;&gt; Rich don't want to be pushing Martin as\nwell.\n&gt;&gt; Or towing.\n&gt;&gt; I'm I'm getting some fuel in. So yeah,\n&gt;&gt; fuel\n&gt;&gt; I think we finished talking.\nOh god, we have a water feature. Oh my\ngosh. Oh, this is interesting.\n&gt;&gt; Oh my god, Martin.\nOh, M.\nOh, gravel bike.\nSorry. Yes.\nChampion.\n&gt;&gt; Oh no.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, I'm in the ditch. I'm in the ditch.\nI'm in the ditch. Hang on. Backup's\narrived.\nScotland is illegally beautiful. Unreal,\nis it?\n&gt;&gt; Oh, no.\n&gt;&gt; What's up?\n&gt;&gt; This climb.\n&gt;&gt; Are you dying?\n&gt;&gt; This climb is going to kill me.\n&gt;&gt; You got it, buddy.\nI'm in like very low single digits on\neco now. Are you?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. I say\nOh man, that bad. It's\n&gt;&gt; starting to hurt a bit now.\n&gt;&gt; Is it?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Do you want to know where we're at?\n&gt;&gt; Nowhere near 16% left.\n&gt;&gt; 32k, but it's 40 odd to the So you got\n8k to get out of that. And it says\nyou've got range for five.\n&gt;&gt; Five. So I've got eight to do.\n&gt;&gt; Eight to roughly. I That's what they\nsaid. It's about 40. Yeah.\nOh, dude. I don't know if I've got this\none in me. Got it.\n&gt;&gt; Look at the range, though.\n&gt;&gt; I mean, I'm gaining battery. So, well,\nnot battery, but range.\n&gt;&gt; You're not I'm saving some power for the\nstage. There's got to be a stage before\nthe food stop. And I still want to win\nthis thing.\nOh, bridge. Oh, step. Oh, narrow.\nThat's quite\nOkie dokie. Then it's getting a little\nbit worrying now. I'm going to hand you\nover to Martin for a little update. So,\nwe've got\n&gt;&gt; What do you reckon?\n&gt;&gt; Well, we're not really sure where the 4\nkm.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. But we've got That's where we are\non tour and this bit of land needs a bit\nof tour. But 8% battery, three km range\nand a uh\n&gt;&gt; a tired mark. I'm not the I'm not in the\nbest state at this point. I need them\nbatteries, man.\n&gt;&gt; So bad.\n&gt;&gt; That's it.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. But careful.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, bit of a drama\nbecause Martin's had to turn his bike\ndown at such a low low mode.\nThe steeper hills that we're getting to\nalmost impossible. Bit of a push\nrequired. Now I got to go back down and\nget my bike. Oh, I tell you what, we're\nstruggling on battery.\nI'm tired. I'm much tired than I should\nbe with how much we still got left cuz\nnot halfway yet. But this battery issue\nis really sat my energy.\nBut it's amazing out here. Oh my god.\nLike look where I've been. I'm just\nstunned by these bikes sometimes. Cuz a\nperson in my situation, this is not\ntrivial.\nIt's really incredible. Very grateful.\nBut I'm tired.\n&gt;&gt; We're nearly there. I think we're\n&gt;&gt; down to one range, Rich.\n&gt;&gt; 1 kilometer mark\n&gt;&gt; on eco. We're at 40k on the docky miss.\n&gt;&gt; Hey, you know what? Go on.\n&gt;&gt; That's the furthest I've ever ridden.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I can do it. Is it? It is, isn't\nit?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. That's literally the fairest off\nroad you've ever been.\n&gt;&gt; I've never unassisted. Like no lifts.\nNot talking like whistle or nothing.\nLike your own.\n&gt;&gt; There was a bit of assist from you on\nthat last hill.\n&gt;&gt; Happy to help you.\n&gt;&gt; You know, under your own steam.\n&gt;&gt; Crushed it.\n&gt;&gt; But I'm a bit scared now. Well, we might\nhave reached our limit if we don't come\nacross something soon. Ow. Um, hey, I\njust felt it's got to rain.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah, me too. Say that.\n&gt;&gt; Oh my god. Imagine it.\n&gt;&gt; Uh, so sorry. Where are we right now?\n&gt;&gt; We are at this crossroad.\n&gt;&gt; 14. Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And we need to get to 19.\n&gt;&gt; 19.\n&gt;&gt; Well, we're never going to make that.\n&gt;&gt; One second.\n&gt;&gt; we'll never make that.\n&gt;&gt; The battery's gone. Done. 1 km on it.\nBut that's on eco, so there's there's no\nbattery on anything else. And\n&gt;&gt; we don't know where the batteries are,\n&gt;&gt; unfortunately. And\n&gt;&gt; we're in big trouble actually.\n&gt;&gt; Do you want me to arrange\n&gt;&gt; and the rain's coming?\n&gt;&gt; Why am I even doing this race? So my\nheroes on handbikes are people like\nChristian Bag.\nHe developed the Bowhead RX. Um, and\nGoogle Ortiz. They their pinnacle of\nriding is doing the Leadville 100\nin Colorado. It's like it's called like\nthe race at the top of the world. It's a\nmassive altitude, 100 miles. Uh\nChristian was the first person to ever\ndo it on a handbike and did an\nincredible time.\nAnd when you like admire people like\nthat, you're like, \"Oh, I wish I could\ndo that.\" And I guess I entered Grinduro\ngoing, \"Well, how can I even ride a\ndistance of any kind?\" And this was the\nfirst thing I saw that I could get like,\nright, if I could get close to 50 miles,\nthen I'm on my way at least. I don't\nknow. Could I do Leadville? I mean, it\nit's such a spectacular event. Like\nChristian made it look amazing and it's\njust in such an incredible location.\nSo\nmaybe that's the next target.\n&gt;&gt; They've said they've spoken to Cal. It\nis good as confirmed. He's waiting for\nactual confirmation, but it does sound\nlike your batteries are down the hill at\n19.\n&gt;&gt; Come on.\n&gt;&gt; Good luck, guys.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I've still got pushing for an arc.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but we've got hope, Rick.\nThe weather is pretty horrific now. We\nthought we had until about 4:00 in the\nafternoon before it was going to change.\nWell, it's it's way before that.\nLuckily, we're packed for it. But we\ndon't have power\n&gt;&gt; right now as you\n&gt;&gt; Oh, zero zero range. No, zero range.\nI've never seen that in my life.\nOh, this hill turned up at the moment.\nOh, Christ. Push.\n&gt;&gt; I'm pushing really fast.\n&gt;&gt; If you can see me through the uh smeary\nlens, I apologize.\nWe've been trucking on now for another 3\nor so K. We still haven't got to the\nfeed station\nand the rain is just horrific. It's uh\nwe've kind of made the executive\ndecision, haven't we, that when we get\nto the feed station, it will just be the\nbest way back rather than the route\nback. I think unfortunately\njust Martin's arms. They're they're\nhurting, right, buddy?\n&gt;&gt; Arms are hurting. We've got We've got no\nbattery anymore. Look, zero.\n&gt;&gt; It's just me at this point. But I think\nwith this last bit, which someone said\nwas a kilometer, and it definitely has\nbeen longer than a kilometer.\n&gt;&gt; I mean, look how slow it goes once the p\nit really drops off. Right, I got to get\nback pushing. I'll see you in a moment.\n&gt;&gt; It really is.\n&gt;&gt; Hey, how you doing?\n&gt;&gt; Is this the feed station?\n&gt;&gt; It is. Oh,\n&gt;&gt; it is\n&gt;&gt; music to our ears.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, man. I'm done.\n&gt;&gt; Quite simple, is it?\n&gt;&gt; I'm so done. Oh, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; When did it go flat?\n&gt;&gt; Oh, like\n&gt;&gt; forever ago.\n&gt;&gt; 10k ago.\n&gt;&gt; Was it? Oh my god.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, it's been so hard.\n&gt;&gt; Hey, look. It's not a one on the\nbattery. It's a exclamation mark.\n&gt;&gt; Is that what it says now?\n&gt;&gt; So, we we made it. Look at that. There's\nno no battery. We've even got an\nexclamation mark on the power.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, thank God.\n&gt;&gt; Thank you to Neil Russell from Adaptive\nRiders Collective for sorting out them\nbatteries for me. Else I would be in\ntrouble. Um Rick is going to try and get\nthe batteries. I'll swap them over and\nthen we should be on our way.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think so.\n&gt;&gt; Although my I can hardly hold my arms up\nwhere they are at this moment. Is that a\nbad sign?\n&gt;&gt; Right. Look at that.\nCan you see that? Full\n&gt;&gt; 100%.\n&gt;&gt; Battery's in. Let's go.\n&gt;&gt; Back again.\n&gt;&gt; Martin's back.\n&gt;&gt; Tell your friends.\n&gt;&gt; We're back in the hunt.\n&gt;&gt; You're obviously very You can go a bit\nslower.\n&gt;&gt; Hey,\n&gt;&gt; we're like I've got turbo.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, so good.\nSo good. So, we've just got to the next\nstage right there.\n&gt;&gt; We're right down in the mountains now.\nUm, we've got some big climbs to do to\nget out. But check this out. We've just\ngot\nto the coffee stop. That's weird.\n&gt;&gt; But it's just the one climb.\n&gt;&gt; Hey, cheers, Mark. Cheers, man. That's\nfantastic.\n&gt;&gt; Drink it in.\n&gt;&gt; Amazing.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, it is.\n&gt;&gt; This is serious. We've decided to carry\non with the big route and we've just\ngone up a climb in a minute that they\nsaid is horrendous. Um, but that just\nmade us want to do it.\n&gt;&gt; That made us want to do it more. Sorry.\n&gt;&gt; But we are about to take on the next\nstage. And this is where it gets pretty\nbrutal for Richard. Beep mcne steep\nface. It's also stage three. We have\nmissed a stage annoyingly.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. You see, can you see this? Do you\nknow what that is?\n&gt;&gt; What?\n&gt;&gt; Game face. If they are down, you're in\ntrouble.\n&gt;&gt; My My legs do get tired and I've been\npushing you just to throw some things\nout there.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, dude. We can go at the same time.\nLet's go. Come on.\n&gt;&gt; I'm running out of energy.\n&gt;&gt; Are you actually?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. I've gone out too hard, Rich.\n&gt;&gt; Okay. You realize we haven't started\nfinding yet? Oh, but that's where I'm\nstrong.\nIf I can't go as fast as him,\nthe climb. Oh, this is going to be hard.\nI may have underestimated this.\nOh, thank God.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Oh, that was hard.\n&gt;&gt; That climb was my limit. It was so\nsteep, so slippery, and I knew if I\nstopped,\nI wouldn't get going again without\nhaving people help me. And to be honest,\neverybody going up that hill didn't look\nlike they wanted to help me. They just\nwanted to get to the top. It was so\nsteep. Most of them were walking um bar\nrich. And uh yeah, it just became a real\nbattle to get to the top. But I'm so\nglad we chose to do it cuz it was a real\nhigh point of the race actually. that\nwhole stage. It was really spectacular\nand it was so brutal. Yeah. And then\nonce you got to the top, you'd climb so\nhigh that you had an incredible downhill\nto come, which made it all worthwhile\nand I could really let the old bowhead\ngo then. Uh yeah, it felt pretty\namazing. The sign back there just said\nhighspeed descent. I think I'm going to\nlet Martin lead out on this one.\nOh my god.\nFrom what you can see behind me over\nthere in the clouds, that's where we've\ncome from. That's where we raced up to\nand we've belted back down. We come\ndown.\nOh my goodness,\n&gt;&gt; those downhills were insanely fast.\nAfterwards, I checked my Garmin. Uh, I\nwas running the big 1050 and I looked\nand it said my max speed was 56 or so\nkilometers an hour and Martin was\npulling away. So, he must have been 60\nplus for sure. He was an absolute\nmissile down there.\nOh, we have had a time.\n&gt;&gt; Since we last saw you, it has been ace.\n&gt;&gt; Hey, man. This is the Grinuro.\n&gt;&gt; So good. We're having an amazing time.\nWe got through the battery nightmare.\nJust\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it was\n&gt;&gt; like\n&gt;&gt; frustrating.\n&gt;&gt; Just And then we got the batteries in.\nGlorious. And then we come down to this\namazing gorge. We're about to start a\nstage. There was a coffee shop.\n&gt;&gt; That was nice. It was slightly sort of a\ntainted brew in the way that it was\nthere at the base of what was stage\nthree. Uh Steepy Mcepersonen or\nsomething.\n&gt;&gt; That was serious. I nearly I nearly\ndidn't get up there. Rich\n&gt;&gt; wow went like un unbelievably fast.\nThere was everybody was walking.\n&gt;&gt; Obviously I wasn't.\n&gt;&gt; And I couldn't stop. I knew if I stopped\nI wouldn't get going again. I just knew\nit. I was like I must keep going. And I\nwas just talking to myself saying,\n\"Don't stop mine. Don't stop. Don't\nstop.\" And I got to the top. I was so\nch. So some stats for you to keep you\nupdated. So we are literally just shy of\n60 km, which is insane, burn.\n&gt;&gt; We've climbed 927\nm,\n3 hours 44 moving average speed. And I\nsaid, remember I said, well 13 would be\ngood. Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; 16 we're done.\n&gt;&gt; That's not bad. And with what happens,\nthat's not bad.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So you know, we're\nabsolutely motoring on. We're doing\nreally well. Not to put down on things.\n50% battery left on Martin's bike.\n&gt;&gt; And that is the battery. We haven't got\nany more batteries.\n&gt;&gt; No. 20 or so km potentially left to get\nback an 18 km range.\nI This is the fourth stage we're at now.\nDon't know what to expect. Um, it looks\nThis one doesn't look so bowhead\nfriendly. It just looks so gravel like\nfriendly. Now,\n&gt;&gt; what is the bowhead really good at and\nwhat is it really bad at?\n&gt;&gt; The b the bowhead goes mad fast on an\nopen downhill track. Like if you imagine\nlike old '90s downhill racing at Mammoth\nMountain, it does that exceptionally\n&gt;&gt; Scarily. Yeah, maybe too well. But um,\nand it climbs. It doesn't climb fast,\nbut it will climb incredible stuff. And\nI did earlier on. Um, when it gets\nreally narrow, it can get a bit tricky\ncuz you just got to be so on point and\nthe tires are so wide, they can catch\nthings, which I've done a couple of\ntimes.\n&gt;&gt; You have? You did have a topple.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. A little.\n&gt;&gt; Should we race before you get eaten\nalive?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's race.\nOh, no.\nMartin's going to struggle on here cuz\nthe bow head is so wide. He doesn't sit\nin a rut.\n&gt;&gt; I'm racing right now.\nThey went down.\nor the other.\n&gt;&gt; I'm in hell right now.\n&gt;&gt; Well, these lovely ladies have told us\nit's only another 12k to the finish.\n&gt;&gt; Well, my range says eight.\n&gt;&gt; No, it's not. It's 2 miles. It's 2\nmiles.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, that that destroyed me physically\nand mentally. I gave up on life along\nthere.\n&gt;&gt; Should we finish? Come on. Let's go.\nWhich way is it? Oh, down. Thank God.\n&gt;&gt; And this is it then, Mark.\n&gt;&gt; The finish.\n&gt;&gt; This is it. Hey, done it, man.\n&gt;&gt; Hey, Mark. Oh, mate. Well done, buddy.\n&gt;&gt; Very proud of you. Did really good.\n&gt;&gt; Really good, though.\n&gt;&gt; Um,\n&gt;&gt; sorry. Do\n&gt;&gt; you want to know how far you went?\n&gt;&gt; Go on, tell me.\n&gt;&gt; 73.85 km.\n&gt;&gt; New record.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, average speed\n16.7. Exactly. 1,000 m of climbing. 4\nand a half hours moving.\n&gt;&gt; That's mad.\n&gt;&gt; 8 hours on course.\n&gt;&gt; We I can tell you that. Hang on.\n&gt;&gt; 7 hours 20 minutes elapse time.\nGood answer. One of the best rides day\nride in Ireland. So good.\n&gt;&gt; The weather was wild.\n&gt;&gt; Words describe it.\n&gt;&gt; Very funny,\nbut at times of hardship. That was too\nmany. That wasn't very exciting, was it?\nFive words to describe it.\nA very funny\nass kicking.\n[Laughter]\nThat's about right.\n&gt;&gt; My buddy just absolutely crushed it.\n&gt;&gt; Rubbish as words.\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's a shame because that's our\njob.\n&gt;&gt; That's literally what we do.\n&gt;&gt; It felt awesome. I honestly had such a\nfun time the entire time that I'm I'm\nsort of amazed cuz it was quite a long\ntime on the bike in the end, but it just\ndidn't feel like that at all. It felt\nway shorter than it was cuz we giggled\nalmost all the way around like idiots,\nwhich if you spend any time with us, and\nLou will vouch for this, we are.\nI need\nthis."
