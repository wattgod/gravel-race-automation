SUBSCRIBE for more race content \ud83d\udc49 https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsr-SU_SAqjrzmu4kXIRfUQ?sub_confirmation=1\n\nHart Hills Gravel Race starts and finishes in downtown Hart, MI. I raced the 55 mile course which is part of the Michigan Gravel Race Series (MGRS) Long Series.\n\nUgh, what a tough 2 weeks leading into this recovering from multiple MTB injuries from a Bentonville, AK, mountain biking vacation.  Looking into race day I was prepared to just make it a tough training day as the legs felt like trash.  To make matters worse, the course conditions were difficult with deep sand and a strong headwind.  Got dropped early on the first set of hills but able to chase back on, only to be dropped on the very next hill. Was able to make up some ground on the sketchy 2 track and eventually settled into a good group fighting for top 10. \n\nThe middle couple hours went well and I felt like I was able to hang on. However, in the last sandy 2 track section that leads into a steep big hill I unfortunately got a big stick in the front wheel that forced me to stop and remove it. The group of 4 others were all past me and I had to chase back on. The chase back led right into the big hill and I made matters worse by losing the front end in some sand and had to put a foot down. Ugh, now I'm dropping back even further. I was able to chase back 2 riders but there was still 2 ahead (9th and 10th place). The 3 of us tried to chase back but the deep sand was relentless and we eventually became just 2.  I was able to win the sprint and take 11th overall and 1st in my age group.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Hey!

      "description": "Lost track of who was ahead of me on the first loose downhill. Chaos when we mixed into the 25mile riders.\n\nDidn't click in my head that after I lost the back of the Tandem on the downhill towards the end, that my race was now with the people behind me.\n\n Should have been checking back to see what was coming.\n\nJumped too early on the sprint at the end. Missed out on 4th overall. Good experience for the next race.",
