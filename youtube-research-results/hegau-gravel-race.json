      "transcript": "uh well the course is a bit harder than\nuh\nexpected it's crazy I think I've never\nwritten a course this uh\n[Music]\n[Applause]\ndemand it's now or\nnever if I want to qualify for the elite\ngravel World Championships it has to\nhappen in these\nraces\nnow yeah\nit's come on power\nall right we're going to do things a\nlittle bit different International\nvideos are going to be in English and\nDutch videos are going to stay in Dutch\nbut I will subtitle them so if you're\nnew and you want to see those videos you\ncan watch it with subtitles we're off to\nsingan Germany Southern Germany it's a\nbloody HUD and it's a really long drive\n9 hours\nwell this is my first year as a gravel\nPro in team Les dance uh gravel\nCollective with Greg F aat and pet Vach\nand besides racing the biggest gravel\nraces in the world I'm also trying to\nqualify for the gravel World\nChampionships and this far is going\ngreat yet I didn't qualify yet so I need\nstill need to qualify so we're over here\nin southern Germany\nsinging oh what a lovely\nview what a lovely\nView to write UCI gravel World Series he\ngo gravel that's\nit all right and what's on the menu\ntoday we're going to Recon the course of\ncourse no flat at\nall here 3 km of no\nHills that that's why I came here I want\nto do gravel races with a bit more\ncliming but how the surface is how the\ngradients are I don't I don't know so\nwe're going to do a Recon together with\ny OK there is the\nO is it\nyeah meet my Nemesis this\nseason what will you\nthis is the first time ever that this\ngravel race is being organized but this\nplace is drenched in cycling history all\nright first climb first climb of many I\nthink eight singan has been hosting\nmountain bike Marathon World Cups for\nmore than 20 years now including the\n2017 marathon world championships but a\ngravel race that's a first so nobody\nreally knows what the course is like\nit's going to be a really really tough\nday tomorrow it's like it's crazy I\nthink I've never ridden a course this uh\ndemanding there's no flat it's only or\nsteep climbs or steep downhills people\nsay I'm on my way people\nsay I should stay that way people\nsay people say\nvery\nsteep very twisty off camera turns\ngravel's pretty good so no small pieces\nare a bit off but it's mostly it's\npretty\ngood I was talking to to to to yper\nabout like strategy look every every\nclimb you have to do uh you're riding it\nup above your threshold and and if you\nkeep doing that there's a moment that\nyou're going to explode this is a really\ngood course to to blow up there are guys\nthat are way better than I am like way\nbetter you can try to stay with like\npach and stuff but like there are go\nthey are going to drop you eventually\nbut it's also not a good idea to ride\nyour own face so it's there there's a a\nbit in between if you feel it's like if\nyou're you feel that you are going to\nblow up then you are already too late\nwith riding at your own base so I don't\nknow it's it's it's\ndifficult for you uh well the course is\na bit harder than uh expected oh W how\nhow fast are we going 21.9 average K an\nhour too fast yeah too fast uh it's\ngoing to be Anor robic all the climbs\nare pretty short you don't have time to\nrecover in the downhills because they're\nalso very short and a jade just keep on\ncoming and like 5 kilm ago there's a\nclimb oh it's\nit's heavy lovely area\nthough and haveing\n[Laughter]\nI like the course it's it's it's good\nreally something different nice the the\ncool thing about those UCI races the\nthey're all pretty different and that's\nyeah I I think it's really cool I feel I\nfeel pretty good yeah it's like the\nfirst time uh this year I I I'm not like\nhaving a cold or having something uh\nrecovered not that great I feel awesome\nI feel really\ngood weather update tomorrow forecast\nfor tomorrow is thunderstorms\nthunderstorms thunderstorms\nthunderstorms fer storms during the\nwhole day like there's a lot of rain\nforecast in the night and then in the\nmorning there's also rain I don't trust\nthe weather radar that much because it's\nit was supposed to rain the whole day\nyesterday but it it didn't I hope it\nwon't get cancelled or that it gets\nshortened by a lap for me personally I\nI'm I'm from the north of the\nNetherlands I got rained on the whole\nyear I can get rained on for an extra\nday no problem I don't care\nfor\nLo\nwhat's your strategy for today h it will\nbe to start really in the front because\nit will be very narrow and I think the\nfirst part first 20 km or so will be\nsuper selective so I hope there will be\na good selection and to be there and\nthen in the second lap there will be\nplenty of opportunities to attack so the\nbest will be to try to go solo if if\nthere is a good\nopportunity stay on the bike and push as\nhard as I\ncan after one lap everybody's getting\ntired and then and you are not hopefully\nnot but also but hopefully not that much\nuh the strategy is staying on the bike\nyeah not not not doing not going too\ncrazy in downhills um if if like if guys\nwant to make a difference on the\ndownhills it's it's cool for them but\nI'm I'm I'm not going to do that\nseconds to\ngo all to out\nI don't think we're uh I don't think\nwe're in Germany anymore\nthis course was crazy the we we had to\nride two laps of about 50k and uh in\nthose two laps were 11 climbs per lap\nthe pace was super high\nwe all went up the first climb like at\nMark 10 with way too many WTS and after\nthat came another one and after that\ncame another one and after that came\nanother one and it like after about 20\nminutes I saw like uh on my on my\ncomputer it was it's still after 20\nminutes it said 400 WS normalized that's\nthe highest I ever I've ever seen it\nyeah this was this was not sustainable\nnot sustainable for\nme after like about 10 km 15 km it like\nthe whole field just exploded\nand there were little groups everywhere\nnot nothing more than like 10 Riders\neach and like I was in a group felt\npretty good I felt pretty good the whole\nrace and there was like the biggest\nobstacle of the whole course was like a\n3 km climb of about 10 or I know more\n12%\naverage I wanted to to like not to blow\nup on that one and uh it was like the\ngroup I was in was pretty chill I I got\nto dictate my own pace that was pretty\nnice already saw the a few of the faces\nthat I would see for the entire race all\nthese races with a lot of climbing\nthey're pretty honest like the guys you\nsee in the beginning are also the guys\nyou see in the\nend go go go go go go go go go go\ngo go go go go go\nyes five the\ngr if you like this content Please\nSubscribe if you like it it will mean\nthe world to me if you subscribe please\ndo it and if you're already subscribe\njust like the video or follow me on\nInstagram or something there were some\ngnarly descents\nthough the very steep descents there was\na descent like a grass field 15%\ndownhill it was crazy and it all worked\nout everything worked out fine the\nsecond part was a bit more flat uh some\nreally Punchy climbs though like really\ngood for uh riding a finale uh I was\nlooking and marking where I would attack\nin the last lap like okay would if I if\nI feel good I attack\nthere h p come on P\nyou just like walking a fine line is\nthis enough am I riding too much above\nthreshold is am I going to blow up or is\nit fine am I going to blow up or is this\nfine and then when when I started the\nsecond\nlap I I I came to the conclusion that I\nfelt really good so I was the strongest\nmaybe the strongest guy in the group uh\non the clients and I also started\ndoubting myself a little bit so could\nhave got on harder maybe I've could have\ngone with the group in\nfront\nokay maybe I shouldn't be so careful\nwith measuring my\neffort the whole group was maybe a bit\ncooked\nthe second time we did the big climb I I\nI rode it all uh I rode it all in the\nfront uh had to really could dictate the\nface and may I was trying to maybe drop\na few guys but I also started thinking\nhow I how can I win from this group like\nyeah you're not riding in the front you\nknow I have to be honest I'm I riding\nfor like 30 position or something like\n31st 32nd I don't know but still you\nwant to finish the race\ngood I kept feeling like I my legs are\nreally good I still have a lot left in\nthe tank and uh so I\nattacked an embankment really really\nweird climby thing and then afterwards\nthere's a sort of fall Splat and then a\nshort downhill then another climb of\nlike four minutes or 3 minutes and I\njust went full gas and then two guys\nfrom the same team they stayed with me\nand then we rotated to the finish and I\ngot nicely flicked by uh the two guys\nfrom the same team of course and the guy\nin second wheel he just let the wheel go\nand uh I had to close the gap uh did\ncouldn't quite close it and he out\nsprinted me in the end\nman he\nthere was really hard we had a good\ngroup in the end we uh rode\naway last\nHill that was really nice but like I\nfelt I H held back a bit too much oh\nyeah in on the second left I thought I I\nI in in retrospect I could have gone\nharder cuz I was\nlike maybe the best on the Hills it was\nreally fun yeah had a good group it's\nimportant I think it's not enough to\nqualify it was\nbest yeah best result in the UCI race\nyeah still not enough\nso 37th in the end my best result at a\nUCI race but still like with the level\nit is now it's not enough to qualify\nthere were only like 75 or 80 guys\nracing but still like uh the upper half\nof the results sheet upper half pretty\ngood pretty happy with it so third now\nthat's that's not to bad for a holiday\nfor a holiday with and also for after\nholidays because I took 4 days off and\nFriday I did 1 hour yeah oh really and I\nand then I arrived I was like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I\n[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up this is a nice race yeah I\nshould have like waited but I needed to\nto take\nsome oh\nyeah you did really well botles were on\npoint really Point like you were there\nevery every time\nthis yeah big up to the organization was\nreally well organized uh really good uh\nreally well marshaled as well uh big\ndifference of some uh from some of the\nother races I've done but yeah I'm\nreally looking forward to the next\nraces like uh next we we do gravel Swiss\nit's like a a Mountain Stage in the tour\nof the tour to France on gravel I was\nfeeling so good today that I I think I\ncan get a good result at gravel SS\nnow on home"
