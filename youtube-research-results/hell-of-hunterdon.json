      "description": "March 26, 2023. Hell of Hunterdon is the annual spring classic by Kermesse Sport, and  explores some of the most scenic roads (paved and unpaved) in Hunterdon County, NJ. This is the 79 mile route. It rained the previous day but it was full sun for the entire ride. I have annotated most roads and added some historical information.\nIf you felt like your time was well spent watching this video, consider giving a like, commenting, or subscribing. I will continue to add rides, races, and technical videos. Thanks!",
