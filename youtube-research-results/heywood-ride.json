      "transcript": "[Music]\nOh,\nhi. Didn't see you\nthere. Time to make my\npourover. Today I've got a video about\nthe Haywood. was lucky to go out there\nthis past weekend, spend some time with\nfriends, be hosted by\nfriends. The Haywoods put on by Heath\nCreek\nCycles, Ben and his friends from the\narea, and I've been wanting to go out\nthere for a long\ntime. This was finally the year I was\nable to make it happen. So, huge thanks\nto Ben and his whole crew, Jason\nand awesome wife, Jen, for\nhosting, putting up with me for a couple\ndays. Made everything real\neasy. The ride itself was great, but it\nwas really\ncold and because\nI'm from the city, I really wasn't\nprepared for the cold weather that we\nhad. Watch out. who put that machine\nthere. I thought I'd brought enough\nlayers, but I\ndidn't. So, I opted to ride only the\n30. And it was the right choice. Got to\nspend the whole day with my friend\nSteve, who we've known online for over\n10 years, I think. All brought together\nfrom Salsa Fargo, which is how I know\nJason and Ben and so many other people\nthat were there.\nI got to see a different\nBen who's also from Northfield. I found\nout. I didn't realize\nthat. We hadn't seen each other since\nthe start of the tour divide back in\n2011. That was pretty wild. Just saw him\nfor a moment before the\nstart and then he raced\noff while I hung around.\ngot to add another mug to the where I've\nbeen collection. Northern\ncoffee. All in all, I feel like this\nevent was, and people say this all the\ntime, but it was more about the people\nfor\nsure. I think I could have left my bike\nat home and still had a great time this\nweekend.\nThe writing was just kind of in between\nall the fun hangs and the great\nconversations.\nAnd so I shot some video this weekend,\nput a bunch of clips\ntogether. I hope you enjoy it. Give it a\nlookie. Share it with your\nfriends. And if you're thinking about\ngoing next year, do it. It's worth it.\nSo check out video on the Haywood.\nHeat. Heat.\nAll\nright. Why didn't you do that? Why is\nlight? Well, he's not doing it this\nyear. This is always the first section.\nSo, they do the running event.\nYou guys want to eat here? Anyone? I\ndon't think you cross the park.\nAnd there's a state park on the other\nside. You can't see\nDude, I feel like that long bike is\ncheating.\nOkay.\nI know.\nYeah.\nDang. I don't know if those wheels fit\nin this picture. Hell yeah.\nMorning, Aaron. Thanks for coming to the\nHaywood. Minnesota loves you. Here at\nthe Haywood. It's cold as hell out here.\nI don't know what it is. It's in the\n40s, but it feels like it's in the 30s.\nJason gave me a pro tip before we left\nthe house. Grabbed some just buck bags.\nSo, got one of these.\nPut my foot in\nit. Much better.\nyour\nvisor. Woo!\nAh, there you are. He's looking for you.\nYeah,\nSteve. How's it going, Steve? All right.\nIt's good to be riding with you today.\nGood to be rid with you,\ntoo. First time in\nforever. Yep.\nlike\nthat. This will just kind\nof drop in. You'll see a bridge. We're\ngoing to stop like right after the\nbridge. Okay.\nYeah, if it's sunny\nout, it's all dappled.\nAh,\nwhat do you got there? Oh, this is just\nthe start.\nLook at this.\nHow you guys do it? The Haywood.\nThat flag showing us the wind and we're\nabout to turn right into\nit. Morning.\nJust about done the\nHaywood. 30 plus bonus\nmiles. Windy,\ncold, man. Tough\nstuff. Glad I only did the 30 though.\nThanks to Steve for getting me through\nit.\nWell, how was that, Steve? Oh, that\nwas that was great till it wasn't. It\nwas something else. That's for sure.\nSee, that last seven miles into that\nheadwind was Yeah. Yeah, for sure. That\nwas the hardest part.\nIt's all right. Was good.\nAh, the meats. How about your company?\nMy company I have your company was\nexcellent. The meats and cheeses you've\nprovided.\nThe stuffed stuffed olives with\ncheese. No, cream cheese. What was it?\nBlue cheese. Blue cheese. Yeah. I'm\ngoing to need those when you uh I'm\ngoing to confiscate them as soon as we\npark. Yeah, as soon as we finish. Yeah,\nthose are being confiscated.\nall the way at the center. Welcome back.\nAll right.\nAll the way down.\nGood job.\n[Applause]\nWhat's up, guys?\nYou all look good.\nYou\nguys just finished. Oh, good.\nHey,"
