      "transcript": "Oh\nlast week I sat down to my computer and\nstarted scrolling really with no purpose\nin mind just searching after a little\nbit of mindless searching I got an idea\nI wanted to see if there was any\nupcoming gravel races in the area I\nlooked and quickly found the hibernator\n100 this intrigued me I noticed it was\nthis Saturday today was Wednesday on\nimpulse I decided to sign up the\nhibernator 100 offered three distances a\n30 mile a 60 mile and a hundred mile\nrace I signed up for the hundred mile\nthe distance did not worry me but what\ndid was the fact that I forgot to check\nthe weather for Saturday the prediction\nrain all day starting in the morning and\nprogressively getting worse I wasn't\ngoing to back out not now anyway Friday\nnight I packed my bags and went to bed\nready for a cold day of riding tomorrow\nI woke up early gathered my things and\nheaded north for the race\nwhen I got there I layered up through my\ncycling shoes on and went to the\nbathroom when I stepped out of the\nbathroom the race had started people\nwere heading out so I had to hop on my\nbike and do the same\nthe weather forecast had changed for the\nday and the predicted rain would come\nlater in the day rather than in the\nmorning this changed my mentality at the\nstart of the race I wanted to get up by\nthe front group and get a tow to be able\nto cover the most ground I could at the\nbeginning of the race this decision\nwould later prove to bite me in the ass\nbut we will get to that in a few\n[Music]\nI kept up with the front group until\nabout mile 19 here they turned it up to\n11 and I was not up for it\nI met mark and Jay who also broke off\nthe front group and I would ride with\nthem for an additional 10 miles during\nthe race I failed to consider the\ndifferences in race lengths I was doing\nthe hundred mile but mark and Jay were\ndoing the 60 so after taking the wrong\nturn I turned around said good day to\nmark and Jay and was on my own way it's\nnot intended to be a poem but it was\nthis was actually the highlight of my\nday the rain had not come yet and I was\nalmost 1/3 done with the race I usually\nride by myself out here so riding alone\nin the race gave me some comfort was the\nfirst part of the day where I could pull\nmy camera out and record what I wanted\nwithout feeling like I'm holding someone\nback or bothering someone at Mile 32 I\npulled up to the first aid station I\ngrabbed a couple of bananas filled up my\nwater bottles and hit the course again I\nwas then joined by another cyclist his\nname was also Josh it was fun riding and\nchatting with him for a few miles but I\ndecided to let him carry on without me\nas I was seeking a little more alone\ntime and the pace that I wanted to be at\nand pace has been considerably slower\nthan and when I started that's okay it's\nfelt nice for a bit but after a while it\nkept getting longer and longer and the\nrain picked up I started to get soaked\nand was only to the halfway point of the\nrace\nI kept riding alone until mile 52 when I\nhit the next aid station here was the\nintersection for both 100 mile and 60\nmile courses this gave me an opportunity\nto meet some new racers and potentially\nride out with them and I did just that\nafter refueling and filling up my waters\nI joined two racers this would be the\nlast aid station until the finish it was\nsuper nice riding with other people\nagain this is however the point where I\ngot bit in the ass as I mentioned before\nmy pace at the start of the race was\ngood on paper but not good in practice\nmy legs were cramping out and stops\nbecame more and more needed for myself I\ntold them to carry on without me to be\nable to go at my own pace and to let\nthem go at theirs I also had a busted\nfront brake that made a wretched screech\nand I was getting more and more\nfrustrated with it\nnot only did it bother me but I felt it\nwas bothering other writers for this\nreason I separated myself through my\nheadphones in and chose to finish alone\nthis was for the most part fulfilled\neverything is soaked muddy pretty\nmiserable but with 12 miles to go I\ndecided to operate on the front brake to\nsee if I could get it to stop screeching\nI didn't even want to fix it more so\njust have the pistons open so I could\nride without the sound I'd be giving up\na front brake but I was willing to ride\nany other bike at this point I gave up\nand decided to push forward with the\nbusted brake I put my head down had no\ngloves as they were drenched with water\nand I couldn't get them back on and\npushed on towards the finish I caught up\nto some riders that helped me get there\nand before we knew it we were done just\ngot done\nnow it was cold brutal fun just very\ndifficult mentally it was raining from\nabout mile 40 or so so we basically had\nto ride sixty miles just soaked but got\nit we got it\nOh exhausted after getting home I pulled\nmy break apart and realized that the\nbutterfly pin that holds the pads apart\nand busted I also noted that the front\npads really had no pets this probably\ndidn't help my cause here's a few\nlessons I learned on this day if you're\ngoing into an event with crappy weather\ncarry extra clothes fresh socks and\ngloves would have done wonders for me as\nthe ones I had on were completely soaked\nif you are doing a big rider event check\nyour bike make sure everything is in\nworking order and will be in working\norder sixty miles into the event and\nlastly I think the most important one is\ndon't give up even if your gear does\nthere was plenty of excuses I could have\nthrown out to give up on this event but\nI didn't let them change my mind I was\nfinishing regardless of the excuse that\nis it for this video if you

      "transcript": "Right. Hello viewers. Now, what are the\nbest and worst gravel bike tech trends\nin\n2025? Well, to find out, I went along to\nEurope's biggest gravel race, the Trackr\nin Jerona, just outside of Barcelona in\nSpain, to discover what the tech trends\nare right now. And I spoke to a load of\npeople over the finish line. And in this\nvideo, I'll share five tech trends that\nstood out for me. And what I love about\ngravel racing right now and gravel\ngenerally is there are no rules. And\nit's a real wild west of bike setups.\nAnd that means there's a real myriad of\nbike setups. And it's fun to see how\nriders approach the same race from\ndifferent approaches based on their\ndifferent backgrounds, whether a\nmountain biker or a roadie or elsewhere.\nAnd every rider will no doubt tell you\nthey have the best setup, but they can't\nall have the best setup, can they? So,\nlet me know what you think of the tech\ntrends and setups in the comment section\nbelow. Firstly, arrow is everywhere.\nI've never seen so many arrow socks in\nmy life. It's like a road race on dirt.\nSo arrow is clearly very important not\njust in road racing where the speeds are\nhigher but even in gravel where the\nspeeds are yes lower but arrow is still\nimportant which is kind of funny when\nyou remember back to 2016 when 3T\nlaunched the exploro and everybody\nthought the idea of aerero gravel was\ncrazy and they laughed at that bike but\nthat's not the case anymore who's\nlaughing now because arrow is everywhere\nsocks. I never seen so many aeros socks\nin my life. Skin suits of course and\narrow helmets. So those are three main\nsort of onbody tech trends I saw. And\nspeeds on gravel may not be as high as\nthey are on the road, but they're still\ngoing fast enough. The pros anyway,\nstill going fast enough, well over 15\nmph where arrow really matters for arrow\nto be that important. So minimizing the\ndrag on the body with the full outfit of\nArrow kit. The other obvious aeros setup\nwas narrow handlebars and angled in\nhoods which Dylan Johnson as you know is\na proponent and you see his video bike\ncheck linked above and down below in\ncase you missed it. So quite a few bikes\nwith very narrow handlebars but not as\nmany as I would have thought. Most\nriders had sort of 38 to 40 cm flared\ndrop handlebars and there were quite a\nfew on extremely narrow handlebars, but\nmost riders seem to have a fairly normal\nsetup because while narrow in terms of\nhandlebar width is more arrow on gravel\nwhen you're riding off-road, especially\na very technical hardcore course like\nTrackr. It's that balance of arrow on\nthe flatter sections, but also handling\nagility and stability when descending\nthrough corners and single track. And\nnarrow handlebars in my experience just\ndon't handle through the corners as well\nas a wider handlebar. So yeah, narrow\nhandlebars not as common as I might have\nthought because of that tradeoff with\nhandling and getting through corners and\nstuff. The other obvious tech trend is\nwide tires. tires are getting wider. And\nin my 10 plus years of riding and\ntesting gravel bikes, tires have\nconsistently been getting wider and\nwider. And it's just the same as I\nexperienced in mountain biking back in\nthe '9s and the 2000s from 1.5 to 1.9 in\ntires to now 2.4 and 2.6 in tires with a\nbrief outlier to 2.8 and 3 in wide tires\nwhich prove that wider isn't always\nbetter. So there is a limit to how wide\nyou can go. But at Trackr, wide tires\nwere definitely an obvious tech trend\nand quite a few people I spoke to were\nrunning 50 mm wide tires. So proving\nthat 50 might be a new 45. I've been\nrunning 45 for the last few years quite\nhappily, but now running 47 and 50 and\nthat seems like the new sort of\nstandard, but that does raise obvious\nclearance issues with bikes not designed\naround such wide tires. And the avid\ntrend is of course mountain bike tires.\nAgain, Dylan Johnson is a fan of\nmountain bike tires. Done some really\ninteresting testing that shows the\nbenefits of mountain bike tires. And\nquite a few riders had mountain bike\ntires on their bikes. So, a real mix of\n15 mil wide gravel tires and two or 2.1\nor 2.2 in mountain bike tires as well.\nBut tire size is definitely limited by\nthe clearance on the bike. And there\nwere some riders I saw with bike setups\nthat clearly sacrificed clearance on a\nlevel I would not be happy with at all.\nAnd given the mud we encountered on a\nSunday in a 100k race, which was filthy\nbiblical rain, it's clearance that would\njust cause issues in terms of mud and\nstone getting caught between the wheel\nand tire and a bike grinding to a halt.\nAnd that's a real balance and compromise\nwith tie sizes is how much clearance\nyour bike has and how much clearance\nbetween the frame and rubber you are\nprepared to have. And there are actual\nofficial guidelines that bike\nmanufacturers have to follow for safety\nreasons. And most riders push beyond\nthose limits if they're happy to\ncompromise or sacrifice tire clearance.\nThe other tech trend I saw is mixed tire\nsizes, which is the same as in mountain\nbiking. If you mountain bike, you know\nthat generally you have a chunkier,\nwider, stickier directional front tire\nfor cornering grip and precision and\nusually a faster rolling narrower rear\ntire. And we're now starting to see that\non gravel bikes as well. And to be\nhonest with you, I'm surprised it's\ntaken so long. And it's probably to do\nwith the road riding influence where you\nhave the same side tires front and rear\nunless you go for arrow and they have a\nnarrow front tire. That's very rare\nindeed. So quite a lot of bikes with a\nmountain bike tire up front. So 2.1\nsomething like that and then a smaller\n45 or 50 mil faster rolling tread on the\nback. So that's a trend I'm seeing\nbecoming a lot more common and one I'm\ngoing to try on my own testing very very\nsoon. The other tech trend is around\ngearing choice which is down to personal\npreference of course two by or versus\none by to have or not have a front mech.\nAnd while this is no conclusive uh\nsurvey, I think most riders and most\nbikes had one by gearing at\ntracker. And of those bikes, most were\nStram and lots were either their Explore\ngearing with a 1046 cassette on the back\nand a 46 or 48 chambering on the front,\nwhich is just massive for the climbing\non the track of course. But then quite a\nfew riders went to a mullet setup. So\nusing a mountain bike cassette and rear\nmech with a 1052 cassette, then pairing\nthat also with a big chambering as well.\nAnd quite a few riders I spoke to on the\nfinish line of the race admitted they\nwere overgeeared. They didn't have the\nlow enough gears they needed for the\nsteep lines on the course. And gearing\nsetup is all about gear range. And I\nspoke to a lot of riders on the finish\nline who readily admitted they were\novergeeared. Didn't have the low enough\ngears they needed for the climbs on the\nthe brutal tracking course. And that is\na really important point. It's all very\nwell having a big massive chambering\nthat looks very imposing, but you need\nthe gears that actually allow you to\nclimb up the steep climbs. When the\nclimbs like on the track are steep and\nlong, you lose more time than you might\ngain on a flat or descent by having a\nbig chain ring. So, it really comes down\nto having or doing your research on the\ncourse if you are racing and knowing the\nelevation on that route and how steep\nthe gradient of the climbs are and\ngearing your bike in an appropriate\nmanner and giving your bike the gears\nyou need to allow you to spin up the\nclimbs and not grind at 50 RPM. On the\none by versus two by I rode the Tracker\n100 on a two by setup. Shimano\nGRXD2 and I was both undergeeared on a\nsteep climbs thanks to that gear setup\nand also in the conditions which were\nawful. Managing the front Meg on the\ncourse going up and down was a real pain\nin the ass. And having one by is just\nsimpler. One less thing to worry about\nwhen you come into a sudden climb got to\ndump a load of gears. And the other\nissue I had was the conditions were so\nawful that the front shifting as good as\nShimano is wasn't that reliable and\nchains was a common issue throughout my\nrace. So yeah, one buy in no conditions\njust simpler and also much bigger range\navailable as well. So yeah, one by I\nthink is winning the battle for gravel\nracing in 2025 based on my experience.\nNot saying two by is redundant. There is\na time and place for two by, but for me\nracing the tracker, one by is the way\nforward. The other tech trend is\nhydration packs. A big bladder of water\nin your backpack with a hose to drink on\na move because in a gravel race, you are\nreally trying to minimize how much time\nyou stop. There are fee stations, but if\nyou stop, fill your bottle up, you're\nlosing time and you've been dropped from\nthat pack, that group you might be in.\nAnd if you're very lucky, you might have\nhelpers, friends, and family holding up\nwater bottles at convenient places\naround the race. But if you're riding\nsolo on your own, then you need to\nminimize how much time you stop. And\nlots of riders are now using a\ncombination of water bottles on their\nbikes and a hydration bladder. And my\napproach, my personal approach was to\ncopy the pros and had two bottles of\nenergy drink, high carb mix in the\nbottles on the frame and then one liter\nof water in the backpack. So I had a mix\nof energy from my bottles, my gels in my\npockets on the hydration chest straps\nand then water in the back for that sort\nof mix of water and energy. So,\nhydration packs, something I thought I\nleft behind in mountain biking in the\n2000s and moved to water bottles on a\nbike, are back in fashion. And we have\nlots of lightweight options on the\nmarket from lots of brands. I'll put\nlinks to some down below that offer a\nlightweight solution for carrying water\non your body. And I trying a new one\nthat isn't available yet, coming out\nvery soon. And I found it very comfy,\nactually. It wasn't heavy. I have one\nliter of water, all my gels in my\npockets here, and it is comfy. Yes, I\ndid sweat more through my back, but\nthat's a trade-off for carrying water on\nyour body. The avid tech trend, and this\nis the most controversial, so I save it\ntill last, is suspension on gravel\nbikes. Suspension 2.0, you might call\nit. Suspension forks on gravel bikes.\nNothing new. We had the Fox AX many,\nmany years ago, and the Rock Shot Rudy.\nAnd I've said in previous videos here on\nJust Ride Bikes that I think suspension\non a gravel bike is a fantastic thing.\nSuspension with big tires is a great\ncombo and better than just big tires on\ntheir own because suspension forks had\ndamping. It's controlled and even though\nit's only 40 or 50 mil of travel, it\nstill makes a big difference on rough\nrocky terrain if you're riding at speed.\nSo you can ride faster and there's more\ncomfort as well and less fatigue through\nyour upper body. And while gravel has\nyet to catch on, Canyon were showing a\nnew suspension fork on a Grail, a DT\nSwiss engineer suspension fork with 40\nmil travel on what appears to be a new\nGrail. And I was actually riding the\nbike in a tracker, but due to embargos,\nI can't talk about the bike at all.\nSorry guys, but my experience of riding\nthat bike with that suspension fork is,\nyeah, it's a game changer. It really is\nfantastic. Suspension and big tires work\ntogether brilliantly. And while 40 mil\nof travel might not sound like much, it\nmakes a massive difference when you're\nriding over washboard gravel. You're\ndropping down a rocky descent. The roots\nand rocks, it's both faster in those\nsituations. You're more control, so it's\nsafer and there's less fatigue. And my\nbody felt fresh as could be expected\nafter a 4hour race. My arms, my wrists\nfelt fine. My lower back, not so much.\nSo, suspension on gravel, yes, I know it\nworks. It still works. But whether it\ncatches on, it's another matter. I think\nthat's because most people come to\ngravel racing are clearly coming from\nroad racing as a background where they\nare weight obsessed. But if you're\ncoming from mountain biking, you'll know\nas I do that suspension front and or\nrear makes a massive difference. faster,\nsmoother, more control. So that's why I\ndon't think suspension on a gravel bike\nwill ever really catch on in a\nmeaningful way because that roady\nbackground that most people bring to it.\nThey're more worried about weight even\nthough we all know really that weight\ndoesn't really matter at all. Arrow and\nand comfort and compliance and\nsmoothness are more important. So yes,\nthat's suspension fork. Fantastic. Can't\nwait to tell you more about it very very\nsoon. So, that is a a small tech trend,\nbut I spoke to Freddy Overt, a gravel\npro with Canyon, and he said gravel\nsuspension for him is a gamecher. His\nwords, not mine. Because his reasoning\nfor saying that is he's a roadie,\ndoesn't have amazing technical bike\nhandling skills, and often on a\ntechnical descent, he's being dropped by\nhis peers. But now with a suspension\nfork, he said it's raised him up from\nback of the pack to near the front. It's\na skills compensator in a way. It's\ngiven him the ability to keep up with\nhis peers who were dropping him before\non technical high-speed segments. So\nthat is yeah, that sounds like a valid\nreason to go for suspension. So some\nreally interesting tech trends from the\ntracker from Europe's biggest gravel\nrace. Arrow is everywhere. Suspension\nisn't everywhere yet. What do you think\nof these five tech trends? Which do you\nthink are hot? Which are not? Let me\nknow by dropping a comment down below.\nAnd of course, let me know what gravel\nrace you have planned. I'm going to\nGrowlic at the weekend. If you're there,\nI'll see you there. But that's all for\ntoday. Thank you so much for watching.\nI'll see you again very soon."

      "transcript": "Hello and welcome back to the Wisconsin\nGravel Cyclist. This is your host Logan.\nToday we're going over the Bear 100\nHoney Bear route. This is my first race\nof the year for 2025 and it was held in\nLeon, Wisconsin. Here we are at the\nstart. Um there were, you know, a great\namount of people that came here for this\nevent. In the 31 mile race that I\nparticipated in, there are about\n140. We started off right in town at a\nlocal bar and we started on this just\nlocal walking in ATV UTV trail that had\nall kinds of bad black top and stuff all\nover it. But it was a very\nnice, you know, flat, easy start to the\nrace here for the bare 131 mile race a\nlittle, right?\nUh at the start here, we really weren't\ngoing very hard at all. We were just\nkind of rolling out. Uh this gentleman\nhere, he wanted to try to get the pace\ngoing a little bit faster. So he would,\nyou know, come in front here every once\nin a while and push the pace just a\nlittle bit. But overall, we really\nweren't pushing hard. We were just going\n15 miles an hour or so, 15, 16 m hour\nand just rolling out at the start on\nthis nice path and trail that they had\nhere for the start of the Bear 100 Bear.\nHeat. Heat.\nAnd then eventually uh David here, the\neventual winner of the bear 100 honey\nbear uh came to the front and decided\nthat we needed to get this party\nstarted. So he went to the front and\nstarted to pick up the pace, which was\ngood. At this point, little did we know,\nthere were others that were and weren't\nreally trying to stay with us here at\nthe front. So, uh, David picked up the\npace, you know, 17, 18 miles an hour,\nmaybe a little bit faster on the flats,\nand we just proceeded to start and\nrotate. Uh the two of us here, the other\ngentleman that uh we saw earlier, uh he\njust kind of sat on the back of us and\nyo-yoed a little\nbit. Heat.\n[Music]\nHeat.\nHeat. All\nright.\nAnd then what you see here is what a lot\nof the raceourse was like. It was this\nhard packed dirt road with trees and\nthick cover all around us. There were\nsome times where, you know, we had some\nuphills and different things like that\nand it was a very, very cool atmosphere\nand cool setting for a gravel race here\nin northern Wisconsin.\nthis section here where we start to go\nup some of these hills with the pines\nand birch trees uh here on the sides of\nthe road. Uh this is honestly one of my\nfavorite parts of the course. It's just\nbeautiful and really accentuates what\nyou know Wisconsin has to offer for\ngravel riding. Um these roads I would\nsay overall decent condition. Uh they\ndid have a fair amount of rain here the\nnight before. So, the roads were rather\nwet and sticky and at times a lot of\npotholes and puddles and things like\nthat. That did make it a little\ninteresting at times trying to avoid uh\nyou know trying to avoid those potholes\nand and puddles and things like\nthat. Eventually, it was just David and\nI. we were able to kind of break away\nfrom the rest of the group and a couple\nof the other riders\nand we just worked on and off together\nfor pretty much the remainder of the\nrace here. Um, at times, you know, if it\nwas a a hill or something like we're\nseeing here, he would gap me off a\nlittle bit. This was my first race of\nthe year. Didn't quite have the miles in\nthat I was expecting, but really I was\nfeeling pretty good.\nThat's weird.\nyou know, and at that point, just when\nwe thought we had uh left everyone kind\nof behind us, uh we found ourselves on a\nflat section here coming off of a\ndownhill. And our buddy in the hooded\nsweatshirt joins us here shortly.\nUnfortunately, we couldn't get him to do\nmuch work for us, though. He kind of\njust wanted to ride off to the side or\nbehind us and wouldn't, you know, give\nmuch of a draft or anything like that.\nSo, we kind of just uh got to a point\nwhere I would catch back up with David\non the flat sections like we see here,\nand David and I would end up working\ntogether again.\nAnd then eventually, you know, there\nwere a few road sections on this course.\nUm, none of them were were real very\nlong. It was definitely more gravel\nthan road in this race. Um, in this case\nhere, I'm on the front setting the tempo\nof the of the of the race. At this\npoint, it is truly just David and I at\nthe front. And we're working our way\ntowards the Bear Lake Campground here up\nby Lake Elmo,\nWisconsin.\nUpon entering the road into the\ncampground, this road was very flowy and\nfast. And again,\nthe typical uh birch and spruce trees\nthat you see here in northern Wisconsin\nin a little bit of lowland. Um, you'll\nsee here, I don't know if it shows it\noverly well, but the lake will be on our\nleft hand side here in a little bit. Uh,\nand this is actually where uh Brent\nstayed uh when he was coming up with the\nidea for the bear. Brent is the uh race\ndirector here for the Bear 100. And you\nknow, overall, this was a great event.\nVery well organized, lots of door\nprizes, good food. Um, you know, it's\nwhat you want to see in a gravel race. I\nhighly recommend getting the Bear 100,\nwhether it's the Honey Bear, you know,\nor the, you know, the actual 100mile\nversion of the Bear. I highly recommend\nyou get up to Leona to give this race a\ntry. So, again, we're going through, you\nknow, the campground route here. We turn\nleft and continue. Um, this was all\npaved and this is one of the faster\nsections of the course actually. Um, we\nwere able to roll pretty good in here.\nYou'll see here I get a little bit hot\nand heavy as we're going through here\nand I actually miss a turn. Uh,\nfortunately David's an honest guy and he\nwas able to redirect me and get me back\non course. So there were no unfair\nadvantages for anyone in this race.\nAnd then one of the final sections of\nthe race here was the Rat River Trail,\nwhich at this point I was starting to\nfeel really really tired. Um, again, I\nhadn't had many miles in my legs at all\nthis year at this point in time. So, I\nwent on the front and kind of just tried\nto slow things down a little bit. Um,\nthis trail again, they had had a lot of\nrain here over the last couple days, so\nthere was a lot of water on the trail\nand it was very, very soft and muddy in\nplaces on the Rat River Trail here. Uh,\nthis is very uh cool, unique trail. um\nthey had a lot of um trees and sticks\nand things on the course uh because of\nthe rain and wind and things that had\ncame through, you know, just general\nweather patterns here in Wisconsin in\nthe spring.\nUm but overall, the trail was in good\npretty good\ncondition. So again, I kept the pace\nslower here just to give myself a\nchance. Uh, I knew if I could keep it\nslower, I had a potential to to win the\nrace in a sprint. At this point, we\nwere, you know,\n25, 26, 27 miles into the race with only\na couple miles left on the Red River\nTrail here before we got to the end.\nAnd eventually It got to a point where I\nthink David got a little tired of going\nslower than what I wanted to in this. He\nended up uh coming around me here and\njust stayed steady. Unfortunately, I\ndidn't have any answer for this. There\nwere a couple trees and things that we\nhad to go over, but it didn't slow him\ndown any. Unfortunately, I just wasn't\nable to keep this pace with the lack of\nmiles in the legs and lack of intensity.\nSo, at this point, this is where I last\nsaw David uh in the race on the Grat\nRiver\nTrail. Uh I want to say congratulations\nto David. It was great to ride with you.\nI appreciate it. Um hopefully we'll be\nable to uh replicate this duel again\nnext year. So, again, this is Logan with\nthe Wisconsin Gravel Cyclist, uh with\nthe overview of the Honey Bear, a part\nof the Bear 100 in Lyon, Wisconsin.\nAgain, I would highly recommend this\nrace. I had a great day. I got second\nplace overall, first in my division to\nthis point in my career. My best ever\ngravel result. I'm super happy with\nthis. Glad to have been uh able to to\ncome up and give this ride a shot. Um,\nyou know, final final stats were we\naveraged right about 16 miles an hour,\nwhich isn't bad considering everything\nfelt\nlike felt like you were riding on Velcro\nwith the wet wet conditions. So, I'll\nleave you with just a couple pictures of\nthe\num the bib and the placing and results\nhere. Again, wanted to say thank you for\ntuning in to Wisconsin Gravel Cyclist.\nHave a great day. Let's go for a ride.\n2025. Thanks."

SUBSCRIBE for free WATTS \ud83d\udc49 https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsr-SU_SAqjrzmu4kXIRfUQ?sub_confirmation=1\n\n*** 4th Overall and 1st in Age Group! ***\n\nThis was my first year doing this event and I was riding the course blind having not pre-road any of the sections. For a first timer what an epic 100 mile race on the bike through a complete downpour for most of it!  At least we got lucky with no rain for the first hour and half or so, then the heavens opened up. The back roads were treacherous with big puddles, huge rain ruts and deep soft sand. The conditions took a toll on my drivetrain as you can hear it get worse and worse as the hours went on. I had virtually no brakes and was metal on metal with no pads left. At the end my wheels would barely even spin in the frame! \n\nThe race started pretty chill and one rider got off the front early. He was the eventual winner and no one was interested in chasing him down. My legs didn't feel great early on as they were still recovering from the Lumberjack 100 (100 mile MTB race) the previous weekend. For the first 2 hours of the race a few attacks went off the front but were all brought back. Just after 2 hours I dropped my chain for the first time 02:05:35. It took me a hard 7 minute effort to chase on but fortunately I was able to get back to the front group. Then just 10 minutes later I dropped my chain again, F*ck! 02:16:35\n\nThis second chase back was significantly harder both mentally and physically. There must have been attacks at the front as they were much further ahead. I didn't have much left after my first chase back, so I just tried to stay steady and hope that I'd eventually catch a group. I started picking up straggler that had fallen off the lead group and/or had mechanicals. Eventually after 20+ minutes I found the front group 02:38:05. I couldn't believe I'd actually made it back to the front twice! However, the group was a bit thinner as 2 more riders had already gotten off the front by the time I got back. So now there were 3 riders somewhere off the front, but nowhere in sight and our group was now the front chase group. I say \"chase group\" but no one, self included, was interested in truly chasing down these 3 front riders. We were all just in survival mode due to the conditions.\n\nOur chase group of about 15 riders mostly all stayed together until BigM around mile 65. This is where most stopped for support grabbing water and food. I had brought everything with me to start,  so I just continued onto the singletrack climbs. A few other riders came with me and my goal was to just casually do the climbs and let the group eventually catch back on. This is where the conditions were the worse though. Midway through the trails I ended up dropping my chain for a 3rd time! I was passed by 3 riders and at that time sitting in 7th place overall 03:32:55.\n\nI was able to get going quickly having now become an expert at fixing my chain issues. I slowly started passing the riders that passed me and I unintentionally separated myself. I felt quite comfortable bombing the sketchy downhills and had plenty of energy left to climb at a respectable pace. Apparently I was alone in those feelings because I kept gapping the others.  I came out of the BigM back roads alone with about a minute gap or so. I could see a rider or two in the distance behind me so I sat up and slow pedaled waiting for them to catch up. However, they never did and I couldn't understand why.\n\nI had no intention of finishing the remaining 30+ miles for 2 hours alone in a torrential downpour. Not to mention my bike had become ridiculously crunchy and loud barely dragging itself forward. With no one in sight ahead of me to chase and losing any sight of those from behind, I continued at a reasonable pace waiting to be caught so we could work together to the finish. I must have looked back a 100 times waiting to see someone, but I never did. With about 10 miles or so remaining I decided to just go ahead to the finish line and get out of this damn weather. \n\nNo one was surprised more than I when I found out I finished 4th overall and 1st in my age group! Super happy with the very unexpected results! \n\n***My front camera gave up and quit just over an hour into the race, but my rear camera held strong. The rear camera does however provide a different perspective of the group behind as I tried to stay near the front of the pack. I labeled the key moments (Lead Group, Chase, etc.) to provide context.***\n\n***Crashes at 00:56:01 and 03:41:55.***\n\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Hey!
