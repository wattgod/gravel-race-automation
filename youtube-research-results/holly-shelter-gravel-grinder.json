      "description": "The fun that can be had riding out in the 63,000 acre North Carolina Public Game Lands is fantastic.   Almost any type of bicycle with tires wider than 38mm will work on most of the roads.   A lot of people ride 38-48mm tires and some even use fat bikes.  This specific scene was filmed using a drone about 12 miles from the Highway 17 gate.  Always watch out for wildlife, bears, snake, alligators and when the gates are open to vehicles (hunting season) watch for vehicles.  Come see us at Bike Cycles and we can show you what you need to get out there and have fun!",
