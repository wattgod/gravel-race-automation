      "transcript": "[Music]\nHello everyone. Welcome back to another\nvideo. Today is Thursday the 28th. I'm\nnot actually that sure. 28th of August.\nAnd this coming Saturday, I'm going to\nbe doing my second ever World Gravel\nSeries in Belgium. So, the car is all\npacked. Um, I'm ready to leave. It's a\nbit later than I was originally planning\nthis morning, but I've had a lot of\nstuff going on, so I'm looking forward\nto just hitting the road now. Um, we've\ngot a long old day in the car, to be\nhonest. I'm going to record trying to\nrecord as much as I can of this whole\nweekend. Um, but I think yeah, today's\nthere's not going to be much. It's just\na lot of driving. I've got about 650 km\nto my hotel. I'm doing this all on\nmyself by myself. No support. Bikes in\nthe back. Everything's there. All the\nspares.\nI've got about 6 and 1 half hours of\ndriving to do. So, I'm going to get on\nnow, hit the road, and start heading\ntowards Belgium.\nSo, I am about halfway through my drive.\nI've done about 3 and 1/2 hours in the\ncar so far. Um, gone fairly quick\nactually, which is good. Uh, I'm in the\nmiddle of nowhere and I'm about to have\nsome lunch. Um the roads were quite busy\nto start off with, but they're a lot\nbetter now. So, have some lunch, get\nback on the road, put the foot down, and\nyeah, hopefully get there in time for\nearly evening.\nJust had my lunch. Nice little quick\nstop. Um car filled up with petrol and\nready to take on this second part of the\ndrive. Driving for the day done. I've\njust arrived at my hotel room. It's gone\nhalf 6. Had a few delays.\nYeah, pretty knackered. Um, it actually\nwent fairly quickly, so it wasn't too\nmuch of a faf. Um,\nyeah, nice to finally be at a hotel\nroom, which is quite nice. I'll give you\na little tour in a sec. Um, but\nbasically what I'm going to do now for\nthis evening is I'm going to quickly get\nchanged and head out on the bike. um\njust to try and stretch the legs out a\nbit because yeah, 6 hours plus in a car\nis certainly done its damage. So, let's\ngive you a room tour first. The classic,\nthe French version of your premier in\npretty nice room.\nNice big bed. I haven't even looked in\nhere yet. Bathroom.\nWhat we got? If the light turns on\nthere,\nshower. Nice toilet.\ntowel. No chair in this one. If you'd\nseen my last video, it's funny. A door.\nWhere does this lead to?\nIt's locked.\nTV.\nGot a fridge in here as well, actually.\nIt's quite handy. Got a fair bit of food\nwith me. So,\nfirst hotel I've ever had with a fridge\nin it. Nice.\nAnd my view.\nsort of a car park. So, yeah, not bad.\nTime to head on the bike.\nSo, I'm just on a bit of a ride now. Um,\ngot the road wheels on the gravel bike\npost travel spin. So far, my legs are\nfeeling up miles better than they did\nyesterday, which is the main thing. I\nfelt awful on the bike yesterday. And at\nthe moment, not getting loads of\nproblems with my wrists. So,\ngot like a half an hour, 45 minute spin\non the bike just to freshen up the legs\na bit before big one tomorrow. Trying to\nget ready for the race.\nThis is actually only the second time\nI've ever visited Belgium. Once\ngood few years ago now back in 2018 to\ntour of Flanders. So it's quite nice\nriding somewhere different somewhere I\ndon't know. Um different scenery. It's a\nlot flatter than France. uh a lot open\nright around where all the battles were.\nSo yeah, it's nice seeing different\nviews to once. Uh it's really quiet\nactually the roads and there's no wind.\nSo good little evening ride.\nin the rule book. Who's in charge?\nGuilty. Get a new rule book. So, that's\npretty much it for this first day. Um,\nhad a nice peaceful evening ride uh in\nBelgium this evening. Uh, came back,\nstretched out a bit, had some food. life\non the road, you know, can't be going\nout places. So, I've basically just had\nfood that I prepared yesterday, um that\nI've had, yeah, this evening, and I've\nspent the rest of the evening just\nplanning logistically for tomorrow. Um,\nI'm about an hour and a half away from\nwhere the race is, and it looks like\nthere's going to be a fair amount of\nrain tomorrow at about 2:00 p.m., so I\nwant to make sure I get there, do all my\nrecon ride, and be leaving pretty much\nas the rain starts. Um, cuz yeah, the\nlast thing I want to do is get wet\nbefore my recon ride or on my recon\nride. So, and then I've been doing GPX\nroutes and all that for tomorrow and\nalso the race. So, pretty chilled. Just\nmcking about on my laptop really. Um,\nI'm ready to go to bed now though. I\nhaven't felt like I haven't done much\ntoday, but straining mentally straining\nhas been a lot with all the driving and\nthat. So, hopefully I should sleep quite\nwell and I'll see you guys in the\nmorning for pre-race day.\nHello everyone. Welcome back to day two.\nIt is Friday. It is just before 8:00 in\nthe morning. It looks like it's going to\nbe a nice day. Um,\nprobably can't see that the sun is out.\nI've got up fairly early, I guess, for\nmy standards. Um, but I've got a lot\ngoing on. So, I want to get out there\nand get this recon done. So, I'm going\nto have some breakfast in the room here\nand then pop a little to get a couple\nthings and then drive to the start of\nthe race. Um, I slept well, but I have\nwoken up and I thought I was getting it\nyesterday. I'm starting to get a bit of\na sore throat. Um,\nwhich is not ideal. So, I might have to\nload up on\nLemip for tomorrow. But yeah, let's see\nhow I feel as the day goes on. Hopefully\ngets better.\nSo, here we are. Little car park having\nsome breakfast. Living it large. I've\nsecured some goods,\nsome pastry goods I've never seen\nbefore. Also got just turn the camera\naround. Got my breakfast here.\nMusli goods, coffee on the go. Got some\nstuff for later.\nThat's important. Quiet. Some Suzies\nwhen in Belgium when in Rome.\nChocolatey milk.\nShould get a smoothie as well.\nI'll have that now. Nice little\nbreakfast. Right, breakfast eaten. Time\nto get back on the road. I've got about\nan hour and a half drive to get to where\nthe race is. Uh, now I'm fully fueled.\nSo, I've just arrived\nat the town. Um, got my bike already and\nI'm about to head out for my pre-race\nride. I'm hoping I'm not going to get\nrained on. It's quite cloudy. It looks\nquite windy as well. Lots of Yeah, we'll\nhave to see. Um, I know from the route\nI'm doing about 40k pre-race ride, which\nis just under a lap. It goes straight up\na really steep climb. Um, so that should\nbe fun. But yeah, I'm going to go check\nout, check the pressures, see what this\ncourse is like.\nSo, I've just ridden about half of the\ncourse and now heading back onto the\nroad to the start. I managed to bump\ninto the over 60s world gravel champion.\nSo, he gave me plenty of tips. He's won\nthis race the last two years in a row.\nSo, lots of tips on where to ride and\nhow it plays out and tire pressures as\nI'm still completely clueless with all\nthis stuff as a roadie. So, cruising\nback now through the Ardens Forest back\nto where the car is.\nSo, I've just done my reconnaissance and\nliterally the first climb of the day is\nup here and then you go up that road\nthere where there's that sign. Can't get\nit figure out that sign there. And then\nliterally right behind me here is a huge\nWorld War II tank. Um,\na whole massive area or a massive part\nof this area was affected by World War\nII. Um, and pretty much everywhere I've\nwritten is where people were fighting in\num, the Battle of the Bulge in World War\nII. So, it's quite cool to see something\nlike this. Uh, adds a lot of meaning to\neverything. So, here we are. I have\narrived now at my Airbnb.\nUm, recon done.\nI will talk about that in a second. But\nI'll give you a quick tour of my Airbnb,\nwhich is very nice,\nbut is in the middle of Belgium in\nnowhere. And I thought I lived in the\nmiddle of nowhere in France, but this is\nanother level. So, here's a quick tour.\nSo, it's a lovely little place. Nice and\nquiet. Living room, I guess, here.\nTable,\nkitchen,\nmy bike there after the recon is going\nto need a clean. And that's what I'll be\ndoing next.\nUm,\nbathroom,\nbedroom, and then shower around the\ncorner. So, bits, yeah, perfect for one\nperson. Um, but like I said, very quiet.\nIn terms of the recon, um, first things\nfirst, although I'm feeling ill and I've\ngot a sore throat, I felt quite good on\nthe bike. Um, which is good to know and\npromising for tomorrow. It's going to be\nreally hard, I think. Um, it goes\nstraight up a climb from Lege Baston\nLege, which is like really hard. Uh, 14%\nfor god knows nearly a kilometer, I\nreckon. Uh, and it's quite technical.\nIt's got everything in it. The Growlic I\ndid in May was just all fire roads and\nreally loose rocky stuff where this has\ngot a lot of pretty much nearly mountain\nbike single track. So, I'm very happy\nI've changed my tires recently. I think\nI need to lower my pressures a bit. Um,\nbut things like that will make a big\ndifference. Um, yeah, it's got a bit of\neverything in it. It's really It's going\nto be like 2,400 m of climbing, 140k, so\n30k longer than the Growl. It's going to\nbe a long day. I think the thing is not\nto get carried away too early and go\nmental off the start. Um\nbecause yeah, it's a long old race and I\nfeel like if you do that it could be\neasily game over. So it's going to be I\nreckon between 4 4 and 1/2 hour race. So\nit's going to be long. Um\nyeah, not what else to say about it.\nIt's Yeah, the weather's going to be a\nbig factor. It's quite windy today. It's\nlooking like it might rain tomorrow, so\nit's not going to be hot. Um, but I was\nconfident with everything I was riding\nand from what I saw of the circuit. Lots\nof people out. I think there's about 400\npeople doing my race. So, in terms of\nthe next couple of hours, it's just gone\n3:00 here. I'm going to chill out for a\nbit, wash my bike, and then I'm going to\ngo and collect my numbers and that\ntonight. And then it's basically\nmake food and chill out as it's an early\nstart at about 8:00 tomorrow. Um,\nso early night, get ready, prep for\ntomorrow, and then race tomorrow, the\nbig day. So, I'm back in the car. I've\ncleaned my bike. Um, and now I am\nheading back to the main town of Hules,\nI think, is how you say it. Um, as I\nneed to collect my number, and for some\nreason, it wasn't open until about 4:00\nthis afternoon, so I couldn't this\nmorning. Um, so I'm on my way to do that\nnow. Then I'll come back, cook dinner,\nand chill out for the rest of the\nevening. Most of my stuff is now done.\nGood morning everyone. It has just gone\n6:00 on race day. Um I'm currently just\nhaving\na little bit of breakfast and a coffee.\nUm it's about\njust under two over 2 and 1 half hours\nuntil the start of the race. Um I'm\npretty much got everything ready. That's\nwhat I did last night. I didn't really\nfilm much. Sorry. But everything is\nready. I'm just going to eat, get\nchanged, and then pretty much head to\nthe start this morning. Um, it's game\ntime.\nI am actually feeling a little bit\nnervous, which I don't really get for\nraces anymore now cuz I've done so many.\nBut I don't know. I was slept all right.\nI was tossing and turning a bit, but\nyeah, I guess it means I'm looking\nforward to this race. So, let's crack on\nwith it.\nSo, here we are back at the Airbnb.\nUm, I didn't end up getting much footage\nat all today because well, a I was\nfocusing on the race and also my phone\nhas been playing up loads with storage.\nSo, I've got to keep this brief because\nI don't have much storage on my phone.\nBut 5 hours of riding later,\nI've got myself another UCI gravel\nqualifier medal. Um, yeah, it was just\nunder 5 hours racing,\n142k,\n2,600 m of elevation.\nUm, just under 29 km an hour average\nspeed, and I am absolutely cooked. Um,\nwhat a race it was. I'm not going to\nlie, it made the Grow sort of look like\na walk in the park technically wise. Um,\nit basically at points was a mountain\nbike race. It was like single track\nfast. Yeah, it was mental. Um, I\ncompletely bulled up my start. I had 400\npeople in my age group and an hour and a\nhalf before the race started. I rode\npast where the start was. Wasn't really\nanyone there. Did my half an hour warm\nup, came back like 50 minutes before the\nstart, absolutely mobbed. Um, it was\nalso really cold this morning, so I\ndidn't want to get there too early\nbecause I didn't have anyone to give any\nclothes to. So, logistically, it was all\nof a bit of a nightmare, but basically,\nyeah, I reckon I was 200 plus riders\nbehind the start and then it went\nstraight uphill. So, I never ended up\nseeing the front of the race, but I\nended up finishing 25th out of 400. So,\nI'm really happy with that. Um, I fueled\nreally well. I to be honest I haven't\nfelt hungry after the race cuz I fueled\nso well. Um I was cautious at the start\nbecause it was such a long race. Um but\nthe last lap I was felt brilliant. I\nfelt I kept going. My my body my arms\nwere cramping from the bumps. My back\nwas in pain but my legs felt amazing. So\nyeah, I think it's good good sign for\nthe world champs because it's another 30\nkm on top of what I've done today and\nI'm knackered as it is. So, but I\nfinished strong and the same as the\nGallock, which is the main thing. Um,\nI'm definitely going to be very ill next\nweek. Like I said in a previous videos,\nI've had a sore throat. Um, and after\ntoday, it's going to be a lot worse. So,\nthat's my race. I'm sorry I didn't get\nmuch footage. I had some nice fruits\nafter and watched people finish. It was\na great atmosphere, great event, great\ncourse. Um, organization was great.\nYeah, I nothing to complain about at all\nreally. Um,\nand yeah, that's it. So,\nI leave here tomorrow and I've got a\nlong 7 8 hour drive back home to\nBritany. I don't know if I'm going to\nrecord that again. It depends if I've\ngot storage things or not. I might pop\nby Bastone on the way home because\nthat's a World War II thing and I\nthought why not while here to see a lot\nof yeah the places because all the\nforests I've ridden through many\nAmerican soldiers and British soldiers\nsacrificed their lives 80 plus years ago\num so I can do things like today and\nrace\nin areas where yeah these battles were.\nSo, I think I might go and see some\nmuseums tomorrow, but if not, yeah, I\nI'll do an outro for the video maybe\nwhen I'm back in Britany. But I'm going\nto sleep well tonight. Uh, and I'm just\ngoing to chill out here for the rest of\nthe day now. Um, as I'm pretty cooked."
