      "description": "Iceman Cometh is a point to point race that starts at Kalkaska City Airport and ends at Timber Ridge Resort. It occurs the first weekend of November each year and is an absolute riot! This is front/rear footage starting in wave 3. My Wahoo froze at 23.5 miles in, so no on screen ride data after that point. Start temp was 32 degrees with no precipitation. Ended up 1:54:41 and earned an age group podium spot - 4th in age group. Great day to race. I was on my Trek Supercaliber with Light Bicycle/i9 Hydra hubs and Sram X0/XX Transmission drivetrain. Front camera is GoPro Hero11 and rear is GoPro Hero11 Mini.
