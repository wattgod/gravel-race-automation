      "transcript": "cyclists in cars were headed to\natlantic iowa not atlantic city new\njersey which would be\nalso a lot of fun but a way longer ride\nyes\nwe've got douglas and not douglas\ndouglas yes how long have you been\nriding gravel\noh since about 2017. so just a\ngravel babe i'm a gravel yes\ntoddler gravel toddler what was your\nso you're in like pull-ups now\nno that's lighter that's few years down\nthe road when i get old\nwhat was your first gravel bike uh the\nspecialized orange my orange fat bike\nwhich i still have and actually i did do\none event in 2016 but i didn't really\ncount that as when i\nstarted in gravel because it was the\ncornhusker state games but yes my\nlong time gravel bike was the orange fat\nfavorite gravel event so far\na lot of favorites some that were much\nmore challenging\ncan't have a lot of favorites just like\nyou can't have you can only have one\nbest friend\nyeah that's true that's so sweet\nsometimes you gotta hurt people's\nfeelings\ni don't know i think you know\nto to you know not patronize joe but i\nreally enjoy the solstice that's a it's\na very\ngood event pony express is great too\nwith our friends the hoffman's and the\ncrew down in\nmarysville so i would pick two of my\nfavorites those are probably my two\nfavorites\nmy favorite gravel event is the saturday\nmorning no drop fat bike ride\noh nice\nyou cried didn't you when you said after\nschool we had a heartbreaking moment\n[Music]\ni-680 east exit toward des moines at\nsioux city\nalways follow directions we're in iowa\nit seems like only\nminutes ago we left my house in nebraska\nbut we're making really good time as\nwe're already in iowa\ndo you feel any different now that we're\nin iowa yeah there's just a different\nuh different error about air\nthat's probably cow [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yeah probably\nso we're going to\niowa atlantic city no not atlantic city\natlantic iowa i'm gonna do\na well the proposed route was 37 miles\nto go see the tree in the middle of the\nroad\nwhich is exactly what it sounds like a\ntree grew in the middle of a road\nintersection of two gravel roads there's\na tree in the middle of it that should\nbe interesting\nhowever because we are [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\nwe added a few miles so that we could go\nsee albert the bowl\nand flower on the tree a plow and a tree\nalbert the bowl is like this huge paper\nmachete\nit was albert the bowl is like this big\ngiant paper mache looking bulb\num you'll see them later and then the\nplow entry is literally a plow in a tree\nnot a not a modern pile though like it\nwasn't some drug farmer that ran into a\ntree and his ball got stuck\nit's an old tiny plow stuck in a tree\nso\ndo\n[Applause]\nwe're in exira iowa nothing exciting\nhappens here\num we're about 25 miles in uh gonna go\nsee\na giant paper mache bowl and\na plow stuck in a tree i already saw the\nbig tree\nit was big it was in the middle of the\nand that's what happens when you pack a\nnitro beer on a hot day\nwith lots of rocks it explodes\nbut it's a beautiful day out getting\nlots of miles in\nhow's douglas feeling not too bad doing\nokay\nabout five miles of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] white rock\nthough oh my god that was horrific\nhorrific it was so horrific we're almost\nto the uh paper mache bowl though yeah\nuh stopping for a uh traditional fridge\nbeer\nwe brought four but the other group had\nsome at the tree waiting so\nwe saved ours and now we're going to\npartake in them\nso here we are with albert the bull hola\ncontrary contrary to uh rumors\nmaybe started by me albert is in fact\nnot made out of paper mache he does look\nlike he's made of stucco though\nperhaps maybe maybe he's a cancerous\nbull anyways there he is\nthere's albert albert's the bull\nthat they don't tell you about on the\ntourist\nattraction is that albert has got a\n[&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\nlarge ass set of testicles those are\nsome [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] nuts my friends\nbecause why would you not make albert\nanatomically correct\nand if you want to know if you look over\nthis way\nhe even has a little bit of a dong\nsticking out\nright there but these\nreally should be in some sort of contest\nto uh see who can eat all the rocky\nmountain oysters those are some\nsolid [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] nuts too boys solid nuts\non\nthe yogi the bear booboo\nup and down it's like cowboy\nreverse cowgirl reverse yogi girl\nreverse yogi\ni'm a yogi yay\nso we made it to the plow in the oak\nit's a little underwhelming a little bit\nbasically it's that\nthat is all that is the plow in the oak\na little underwhelming there's a chunk\nof metal and that's what she said\nall right we are done with the\nride i don't know what it's called\nwhatever it's called the ride in iowa\nwe saw a plow a cow and a tree yes\nthe flower was a little underwhelming\nit wasn't very much to see just the tip\nand that's what she said\num what was your favorite part doug\num i enjoyed the tree in the middle of\nthe road\nthat was fun and a couple of cemeteries\nwe stopped and local stuff that was\npretty cool too yeah we saw some old\ncemeteries uh\nsaw the creative side of nathan hamlin\nthe original first person in the county\nuh he's buried out there 18\nsomething yeah it's only about 1843 or\nsomething a long time ago\nmy favorite part was the end uh\nthe hills between what was the name of\nthe town\nyeah south of exile to audubon\nit sucked yeah it's just nothing but up\nand down roller coaster hills were not\nalive\nthick thick white rock gravel\num had a little\nrun in with a landowner when somebody\nposts a route and says that you can\nride a road um maybe take that with a\ngrain of salt\nuh they may not have actually gotten any\nsort of permission\nfrom the person that owns the road\nlesson learned\nindeed indeed the uh mexican food at\nrancho grande mexican restaurant\nin atlantic was just really good um\nhighly recommend it don't get the hot\nsauce it was a\nmovie caliente but other than that it\nwas a good ride\ngood time had by all yes enjoyed some\nbridge beers in iowa too rich beers\nthat is uh not a first but they were\ngood\ngopro stop recording\ngopro off gopro turn off\ndon't listen"
