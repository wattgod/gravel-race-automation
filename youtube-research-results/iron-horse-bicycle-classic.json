      "transcript": "we're sid and mackie for the past six\nyears we've been racing mountain bikes\nprofessionally and living out of our van\nbut in 2020 we had to pause both racing\nand van life because of the pandemic and\nso sid could recover from a nerve injury\nbut now things are finally getting back\nto normal sid's been able to get back\noutside on the e-bike and racing is\npicking back up all over the country\n[Music]\ntoday we're heading to durango so i can\nrace for the first time in over a year\nand see if my training is actually\npaying off\nback in the van yeah we're back in the\nvan\nback to our old which is to say\nit is 8 15 the night before mackie is\ndoing a race\nwe're driving up some bumpy\nroads in the middle of nowhere\ntrying to find our friends and i think\nwe found them yeah so all as well\nwe were just getting concerned but we\nwere like they haven't called us\nso clearly this goes to a place that a\nperson can keep it there's not even that\nmany people here\nright excellent right good time\nthis looks totally normal totally normal\ni am so hungry\nso\nyou've learned nothing during van life\nit's that you can't\ncrack an egg oh you can't you just have\nto try really hard to crack an egg on\nthe dashboard\napparently they make dashboards\nnon-cracking wow\nthe memorial of the story is if you're\ngonna hit your head on it don't do it\nhard don't do it hard lightly tap your\nhead on the dashboard\nthis feels like something that would be\nin like a dare class in high school\nwhere they're like this is your head\n[Laughter]\nthis is your head on drugs in a car\naccident\na driving truck it is the morning of my\nfirst race\nmy first mass start race\nin a year\nand three months and judging by how\npoorly i slept last night i'm quite\nnervous\num i found that for me that's usually\na pretty good sign like if i if i'm\nnot sleeping well that means that i'm\nnervous about the race\nso i'm nervous about the race um today\nis the\ndurango iron horse road race it's like\n47 mile\nfive or six thousand feet of climbing\nfrom durango into silverton\nand then tomorrow i race the mountain\nbike race\ndurango iron horse and they somehow\ncombine your results from the two\nand give you like a overall for the two\nraces\nand i'm pretty excited but apparently\nalso nervous\nso i got a email from mike with like\nrace strategy\nfor the weekend and\nhe talks about nutrition which it's\ngonna be hard to\neat as many calories he wants me to eat\nbetween 650 and 850 calories\nduring today's race so it's 150 calories\nevery 30 minutes\ni'm gonna try but i'm not sure that will\nbe possible but i'm gonna carry like\ntwo packs of chews two bars\ntwo rice krispies scratch rice krispie\nbars\nso i think that'll be pretty good talks\nabout hydration\nyesterday i was drinking a ton\nalternating water and electrolyte drink\nbut then it's the race plan that i\nreally like so for the road race\nlook for some wheels you know at the\nstart but don't bury yourself treat this\nlike a multi-day enduro and focus on\nbeing consistent\non the first climb try to keep things\nunder 295 watts unless absolutely\nnecessary\nrailed it a sense if you're with a group\nstay there the group will move faster on\nthe big wide road than a solo rider\non the second big climb a controlled\nversion of all in\nand then my favorite point number five\nif you see\nsuper skinny roadie types do not try to\ngo with them i think mike has a pretty\nrealistic idea of the fact that\ni'm probably not going to keep up with\nsuper skinny roti types\nso there's the finish line down there\nthat was\nan absolutely awesome race\ni had so much fun i haven't done a road\nrace in a long time and that was\nawesome it was uh really really hard i\ndefinitely did not follow mike's race\nplan\nof uh stay below 295 for the first climb\nthat did not happen definitely not but\nuh\ni sort of feel like after things\nexploded and blew apart and then like\ni kind of found a group to ride with\nonce i found that group\nthen i was able to keep it pretty\nconsistently about 300\na little below for the rest of the ride\ni was able to sprint at the end so i had\na little bit of energy left which was\ngreat\noverall it was just a really really fun\nrace now i'm gonna go spin for\nabout 20 minutes just to flush the legs\nout a little bit and then\ntry to find a ride back to durango\nbecause the way this race works is you\ngo from durango\ninto silverton and then you have to find\na ride back now that i've had\ntime to recover a little bit drink a\nrecovery drink and process a little bit\ni continued to be extremely stoked it\nwas just so much fun\num basically at the beginning we were\nall a big group\ni sort of stuck with the main group\nthere there was a lot of rubber banding\nwhere like\nthe front guys will accelerate and then\nthe guys toward the back of the pack\nlike i have to accelerate harder to\ncatch up and then the front guys slowed\ndown and like\ni'd forgotten that road races do that or\nlike\nthere's these weird surges and you know\nit's called rubber banding because it's\nsort of like rubber band it like\nstretches out and then blings back\ntogether\num but it's hard because it's hard to\nkeep a consistent pace when it's rubber\nbanding you're like\noh sprint hard and then oh i got to use\nmy brakes to slow down and like\nif you could time it just right you\ncould just go consistently\nthe whole time but never seems to happen\nthat way then it started kicking up and\nthe front group kind of went\nand i kind of tried to stay with them\ni had timed it poorly so that i was at\nthe back and so like\npeople started accelerating and all\nsudden i was like oh i'm by myself\nthat's not good so\ni worked pretty hard tried to catch back\nup caught back up essentially but then\nwas like oh if i hold this pace i'm\ngoing to crack i don't want to crack\nso i backed it off a little bit there's\nsort of a group of four of us i think\ninitially\nthat we were all riding together and\nthen people kept getting spit out of the\nmain pack and we'd pick them up and\nthey'd join and so at one point i think\nwe had like 10 or maybe 12 people in our\ngroup all sort of working together\nbut then we started dropping those\npeople also and so\nat the top of the first pass there were\nfour of us\nand then we like descended down the back\nside and started climbing the second one\nat the top of the second pass we had\ndropped one guy so there are three of us\nand so i basically just tucked and had\nan\na great time those that said it was so\nmuch fun there's like these\n20 recommended like 20 or 25 mile per\nhour turns that you could do way faster\nthan that because you can lean the bike\nand\nyeah so we're like ripping down the road\nwas totally closed but they still had\nthe yellow line rule and effect so you\nhad to stay on the right side of the\nroad\nso just ripping down that descent\ndropped the guys behind me a little bit\nbut not enough that\nthey didn't catch back up when we hit\nsilverton so\nthen the thing that fortunately a friend\nof mine had mentioned to me this morning\nis that\nyou don't you're not done when you hit\nsilver 10. you have to go all the way\nthrough silverton so it's like a mile\njust straight false flat so it's\nslightly uphill\nand i was like great i'm in front now\nthey're all gonna be drafting me they're\ngonna attack right at the end so i just\nbasically like backed it down i was like\nwhatever if\nlike if they want to go faster they can\ngo around me they can do the work\nnone of them did until like .2 mile from\nthe end\nat which point everybody started\nsprinting i was able to out sprint the\nnext two guys\nso i was the the front of our group\nwhich was fun but\nobviously we gotten spit off the the\nmain group so\ni haven't actually looked at results\nlet's let's take a look-see here\ni didn't really have any expectations\nfor this race\ni just wanted to finish i wanted to have\nfun and i was very successful in both of\nthose\num but i'd sort of you know i'd sort of\nhoped for like uh\nlike two and a half or a little bit more\ntime-wise wow there were a lot of people\nin this race\nstill scrolling all right i was 47th\nwith a 2 35 36. the other guys in my\ngroup were\nlooks like three seconds back and six\nseconds back the next guy ahead of me\nwas like 38 seconds ahead so\nthat would have been hard to catch up to\nand that's of\nlooks like 72 finishers\na little behind mid pack but like i said\ni just i had a great time\ni felt good i had a good race i'm i'm\nreally stoked\ni spent the rest of the day recovering\nhanging out with our friends sean susie\nand cole and playing cole's favorite\ngame\nof all time throw throw burrito burrito\noh i don't know i think i got it\nwithout you again\nwarming up for cross country\non sunday and\ni'm pretty excited i don't feel too\ntired or sore from yesterday\nalthough uh let's say the undercarriage\nis feeling a little sore just from being\nseated on a road saddle for so long\nhaven't seen the course yet\nbut it's three laps so planning to just\nuse the first lap\nas a pre-ride try to stay with the group\nas much as possible\nand then uh you know see what i can do\non laps two and three\nso overall i'm really excited i think\nit's gonna be fun\nrealize i probably need to go a little\nbit easier because my warm-up is not\nsupposed to be\na lot of effort just 20 minutes of\nspinning with two 30-second\nsomewhat harder efforts just to kind of\nwake the legs up and remind them\nthat a racing is a thing so you hear\nthat legs\nracing is a thing so we are doing today\nto do the racing thing about to watch\nmackie start\num he got a terrible start position\nso that happened but hopefully he will\nget some hole shots\non the way out it won't be last\n[Applause]\ncome on mackie come on come on\nright\nyeah when we see a good spot i'll take\nthank you\nso despite the almost last\nstart position uh mackie did seem to\nwork his way\nup to about mid-pack-ish\nright out of the gate so he obviously\nput on the turbo charge for the start\nwhich hopefully won't come\nback to bite him we were talking a\nlittle bit about strategy he doesn't\nhave the xc fitness that he used to\nand so he doesn't get the start\npositions that he used to\nand he doesn't really know how his body\nwill respond to this effort but it is\nreally just\na training exercise and an opportunity\nto see\nwhere he's at against there's\nessentially a world-class field\ngot national champions former national\nchampions\num one kid who was second in a u-23\nworld cup\nlike two weeks ago so it's a pretty\npointy field\ni'm just hoping that he has fun out\nthere and doesn't take it too seriously\nbecause like whatever\nhe ends up in this race is definitely\nlike a starting point\ni feel for like what he is capable of i\nam gonna mix up his bottles\nand get ready to go to the feed zone\ni think the absolute fastest that mackie\nwould come through this is on like 45\nminutes\n45 minutes a lap however he's never\nridden the course\nthis isn't the course that the amateurs\nsorry about the wrestling\nthat the amateurs were racing so we\nreally have nothing to base that off of\nso i'm gonna be\nearly these guys are\nburying themselves right now\nhere's maggie franklin and uh\nwith one lap down two to go her nine\nmile laps his first lap was like 46\nand it was top 20. so i'm super stoked\nfor him on that\ni'm hoping he'll be happy with that\nhoping he can keep it up and\nnot explode so are you stressed\nthanks buddy\noh\nis\ncome on maggie hi\nyeah still filming me it is still\nfilming me hey\ncome on maggie we have a telepathic\nconnection\nhe can hear me i don't think he's going\nto catch this person but i've also seen\nthat was a nice corner\ncome on maki\nnice job\ndude you still got it\nmentally i was there physically\nthe fitness is not there yet that's the\neasy part\ni think the best way to summarize is\ni felt good mentally i was there i rode\nwell\ni just don't have the fitness that i\nwant yet and frankly that's\nnot surprising um i'm pretty happy with\nthat\nlike i know that there's more fitness\nwork i need to do\nit was really fun to race a mountain\nbike race again\nreally fun especially across country\nrace\nbig group race mass start hadn't done\nthat in a while especially on the\nmountain bike side and\nit was really fun my main takeaway cross\ncountry descents\nare very manageable so i was despite not\ngetting to pre-ride this course i was\nable to ride the descent\npretty hard and then on the second and\nthird laps once i'd seen them once\ni was able to go fast on the descents\nwithout\nfeeling like i was pushing it or like i\nwas sketchy or like i was\nrisking crashing and catch a lot of\npeople\nlike on my second lap i got to the top\nof telegraph which is this\nheinous climb and dropped into anasazi\nwhich is the first descent and it's\npretty technical at the beginning and i\nvery quickly caught up to four people\nwho i had not seen\nat all on the telegraph climb so\nthat's that's sort of what i was\nexpecting and what i was hoping for\nis that like the the skills work that\ni've done the descending work that i've\ndone\nis paying off and so now i really need\nto focus\non my fitness so that i can climb\na lot faster basically because i feel\nlike i'm descending well and i'm happy\nwith that\ni just need to get to the top of the\nhills with those front guys\nand then you know then who knows what\nwould happen so that would be fun\nalso do you guys like my really\nimpressive dirt marks\ni've got a dirt stash i've got the dirt\nunder the eyes and then i've got\nmy dirt helmet marks oh and my unibrow\nso yeah it was a little dusty out there\nwe will see you guys\nnext friday and in the meantime don't\nforget\nto be more awesome"
