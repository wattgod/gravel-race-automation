      "description": "On the hunt for more gravel cycling in the Lake District and this ride took us to Grizedale Forest, which had some epic gravel tracks for us to tackle and some tough climbs. It was a great route planned by the rocket, which included spinning off for ice cream and a gravel section along Lake Windermere before taking the brutal climb back up to Grizedale Forest. I can highly recommend this for gravel riding and definitely more to explore.\n\nAlso some bonus footage from the rocket giving you the ins and outs of group riding...",

We parked at the Wheelbase bike shop at \n\nStaveley Mill Yard, Back Ln, Staveley, Kendal LA8 9LR\n\nLeaving first thing in the morning as the sun began to rise, warmed up soon with the little climbs that kept on coming up. We were all on Gravel bikes which were perfect for this loop as it had lots of small tarmac roads as well.\n\nAfter a few hours of riding and two mechanical issues, we stopped in Coniston for lunch which was just over halfway. After lunch, we got back on the bikes leaving Coniston and heading towards Winderemere to catch the ferry. We were very lucky with the weather getting a bright warm day. \n\nAfter successfully getting the ferry at Windermere we started the last few climbs back to Staveley, finishing the cycle just as the daylight was going.\n\nThe loop had a great selection of gravel roads, paths and great quiet tarmac roads.",
