my helmet but that's all\nI'm done it we're drinking beer that's\nall for now\nper update I've been at this now since\nFriday evening at 5:15 and fudge you've\nseen on my name and I've gone last last\nfour or five hours nine uh fruit juices\nor something too much gas station food\nthe head was set in still have 81 miles\nnon-stop this is Trans Am so still\nprivileged beautiful little flooded life\nis good really hot for now so when you\nsee a sign like this you just got to\nstop and I know that you guys probably\nsaw this photograph last year but I\ndidn't put it on YouTube but I actually\ncame through here last year when I was\non my Michigan trip because I love\nMichigan and once again because my\ntiming is all off the tasty nut is\nclosed but hey check out the cool pop-up\nlittle rabbit\nbe home in a while Tata for now for\neverybody who's thinking about coming\ninto May's destination ride this is the\npumpkin vine absolutely beautifully\nwell-maintained trail\nlots and lots to do on that destination\nride see everybody there so at the end\nof the trail\nmy GPS decided it wanted to crash and\nthen recover its ride of course I need\nto put a route on there so that I can\nget home because I'm changed coming a\nfew miles off but since from where I'm\nat to home I don't know how to get there\nso I decided to you know why stand if\nyou can sit why still if you can lay\ndown so just kind of chillin and rest in\nmy head in my neck and I'm gonna close\nmy eyes for a minute Tata for now a\ncouple minutes after 8:00\nI'm 587 miles in the wind is starting to\ndie down a little bit I'm Shipshewana\ncountry and I have this huge fan club\nthat's been cheering me on when I\nstopped here to just make sure my lights\nare on and get rid of my sunglasses put\nthem in my bag and stuff like that\nI've got probably 59 or 60 miles to go\nish somewhere right in that neighborhood\nso the way the winds are bent been it's\ngonna be after midnight probably closer\none o'clock I'll make sure I post when I\nmake it home safely\nthis girl's like really feisty wonder\nwhy she has a white tag and maybe it's a\nhe I don't know anyways we're having a\nbeautiful ride you know the winds the\nwinds have been a struggle but at no\npoint if I felt like quitting and\ncalling somebody in coming and getting\nme so life is good I got a handle on\nthis and even though I didn't\nachieve the mileage I wanted to on this\ntrip I've had a absolutely wonderful\ntime like I said I'll post when I get\nhome\nTata for now the GPS just routed me on\nto a dirt road it says I need to be on\nhere for six miles as much as I love\nthis bike the fact that I can't put more\nthan 23 zhan it roads no idea how many\nmiles of dirt I've done this trip with a\nlot definitely getting the gravel bike\ndefinitely I like these kinds of roads\njust not on these tires I don't know if\nyou can see it but Suns going down and\nit's still really windy out here I mean\nthe winds died down some so doing about\n13 or 14 instead of 9 or 10 but still\npretty brutal out here tonight there\ncomes a point\nRegis guys say enough is enough for me\nthat's lightning\nright this second I'm safely sound\nChurubusco there is a major storm I've\nbeen watching it for a couple hours\nactually and I've been kind of trying to\nhead off and get to in Fort Wayne but\nstill about twelve miles from home maybe\nthat lightning is going to get there at\nthe same time and I need to work\ntomorrow I'm getting struck by lightning\nwith probably put a damper on that so I\ndid what I always do in an emergency you\nneed to get home situation I called an\nuber be here in a few minutes\nbeen a long day then a tough day that's\na fantastic trainee right\nwell over 600 miles and I'm gonna get\nhome safely to do this again so trying\nto make smart decisions\nTata for now"
