      "description": "The bike route around Lake Constance (Bodensee in German) offers easy and relaxed cycling on good bike lanes and smaller roads in Central Europe. There are plenty of sights, beaches, restaurants, cafes and accommodation along the route.

So, I'm going to follow obviously\nthe route around and then uh make a\nchoice whether it's going to be well,\nit's not the short, it's the medium,\nmedium and large they've got.\n[Music]\ncutting corners there.\nLook. Oh my god.\n[Applause]\nTry not to push it too far. Very uh very\neasy to sort of shoot ahead on the flats\nand the\ndownhills and weaken the in the uphills\nat the\nmoment.\nThey're doing all right actually for the\ncatching up bit on the flat.\nStill on the old railway line here and\nuh just going to go over a road by the\nlooks of\nit. Spoted a couple of people already\nwith uh flats. Should have gone\ntubeless. It's a bit perilous on this\ntrail, isn't it? Bit perilous on this\none. Yeah.\nI think we got a left turn coming up\nprobably at the end of this.\nHopefully it's not too tight.\nOh, I got it. Thank you. You got it.\nNice one. Yeah, you go. Thanks. Got it.\nAh, it's just like bloody Lincoln\nthis isn't it on\n[Laughter]\nthe fingers crossed that it ain't\nIt looks like a left turn here.\nClear\nit. He's got some flares on his\nhandlebars, isn't he? Yeah. Look at\nthat. He'll take off. Where you come\nfrom today? Go. Oh, yeah. I'm Lincoln.\nOh, yeah. Yeah. Very nice. Is it your\nfirst glorious gravel? Oh, yeah. It's my\nfirst go on one of these. Yeah, me too.\nAnyway, enjoy it. Yeah. What's up, mate?\namount of people on the way side is\nuh\nthere. Oh, look a\nhill. No\nworries. Does seem to be gravel bikes\nmore than mountain bikes.\nHeat. Heat.\nThank\nyou. Right. split approaching. This will\nbe me.\nI'm\ngoing. All right.\nDon't suppose you uh put another\nteaspoon there, would you?\nThank you very much.\nSo, made a food stop. Got myself a nice\ncoffee. Got myself a cheap waffle. And\nuh yeah, that should keep me going all\nthe way till the end. But uh\nnice little turnout.\nBack on the uh on the rough stuff again.\nMust be careful down here. Looks like\nthere's some\nruts. Don't want to come crapper.\nChrist. I nearly come across there.\nYep. Sand again.\nIt doesn't go over your helmet.\nOh, thank you very much.\nEnjoy that. I did. It was good fun. That\nwas nice. That was nice. Yeah, good.\nThere we go. That's glorious gravel\nabsolutely smashed. Enjoyed that. That\nwas really good.

      "transcript": "hey there fellow Travelers Mark here\nwith Walters world and today we're here\nin turku Finland very friendly Finland\nand today we want to talk about our well\nI'm going to answer one of your\nquestions that is Mark what are the most\nunfriendly places you've visited well\nthere's been a few over the years I know\npeople like to make comments on our\nvideos say Mark you always say that\nthese people are friendly you say every\nplace got friendly people like yeah\nevery time you can find some friendly\npeople but overall if you watch my\nvideos you'll notice sometimes I don't\nmention the people people at all\nprobably a good sign that the people\nweren't that friendly and so what I have\nhere are just five countries where I\nnotice a little bit less friendliness\nthan usual when I traveled and some of\nit was more of an issue some of it was\njust the situations but these are five\nplaces I had number one Belgium look you\nall know I'm not the biggest fan of\ngoing to Brussels and I like to make fun\nof them sometimes but I can respect\nBrussels for its museums and all the\nthings there the Fantastic beer they\nhave I've taken students there and I've\ndone things there I love get I love Bru\nit's a fun time to go but overall the\nbelgians themselves not always the most\nfriendly people and if you are of\nAfrican descent or Asian descent that is\nthe one country I've gone to Europe with\nmy students where we had racist attacks\non my students okay like I literally had\nto talk to the police we were l in\nbecause my students were getting\nharassed okay like that's one thing so\nthat's one place I didn't find super\nfriendly now I have friends from there\nthere was some there's nice people in\nBelgium but I'm going saying overall\nthat was one place H was a little bit uh\ntouchy second place where the people w\nweren't so friendly was we were in China\nand what's funny when we were in China\nand we'd have like one two or three\npeople around us every was super\nfriendly and kind and fun it was really\na great time but once we got a big group\nof people then everybody started\nfighting over seats in the restaurant or\nor the dragon fruit at there grocery no\njoke or when you're going into a place\nof people whacking you with things like\nit was just like not a very friendly\nexperience and I think part of it is\nbecause there's just so many people that\nit's a you know people are worried\nthey're not going to get stuff and\ntherefore I've got to get on this\nelevator be damned everyone else so\nthat's one thing where I didn't really\nhave a very friendly experience when I\nwas there but it was a cool experience\nbut I mean I'd go back to all these\nplaces I'm talking about but I'm just\nsaying you wanted to know now number\nthree is a very interesting one and that\nis Denmark now the Danes you might say\nthey're rude I like to say they don't\ncare about you because you're not part\nof their life they don't mean it in a\nbad way okay they're not trying to be\nmean they just like we're Danish we live\nin Denmark uh you're a tourist is here\nfor a few days why do I care what you\nthink about my country I want to be here\nanywhere I love Denmark so forget you\nand so it's kind of the um kind of like\nyou're not part of my life so I don't\ncare kind of vibe you get uh when you go\nto Denmark now the Danes can be fun\ntimes to go out party with don't get me\nwrong we've had some good times with\nsome Danish friends over the years but\nbut that kind\nof distance they have makes it so it's a\nlittle bit unfriendly okay not that\nthey're mean about it just like hey we\ndon't care I remember I was in\nCopenhagen filming and I was talking\nabout that kind of thing that that Dan\nare that's Danish guy came up he's like\nthank you you explain it very well it's\nnot that I don't like you it's just that\nI don't care and he walks off there you\ngo maybe they're not unfriendly they\njust don't care which is fine okay you\nhave that now number four on our list is\nArgentina but when I say Argentina I'm\nmore talking about inborn asares cuz\nbisar if you meet people from there and\nthey talk about the rest of Argentina\nyou might hear this oh are you from La\ncapital or La Provincia so you're from\nthe capital or the provinces right and\nso there is kind of a like an some\npeople was say attitude with people are\nin Bor sometime and and I had a good\ntime when I lived there and I had a fun\ntime but I did know it was definitely a\ndifferent attitude in terms of\nfriendliness that you got outside of the\ncapital versus inside the capital so\nthat's another place where I didn't find\npeople be super friendly when I was\nthere and then we have number five which\nwould be number one if I was ranking in\nthe unfriendliness and that is Luxemburg\nsee you go to Luxemburg they get paid\nreally well they have a nice place they\nlive they have good stuff there they got\nplenty of money they don't care about\nyou they don't care about Serv they\ndon't care about helping you they don't\ncare about anything cuz you don't matter\ncuz they're fine you're coming to\nLuxembourg so you should thank us that\nwe're letting you come here that's the\nvibe you get sometimes at the\nrestaurants at the par the tourist stuff\nit's a little frustrating and that's one\nof those things where you're just like\noh why are you so unfriendly I mean it's\nfunny cuz I have friends that live there\nand we enjoy visiting them but I would\nsay as a\ntourist I that was a very friendly when\nI was there and here's the thing I know\nthese are five places that I've been to\nand I filmed that and I en enjoyed\nmyself there but I went through my list\nof places where I found in general like\nthe most unfriendly to me and my family\nthose would be the five places so uh if\nyou're from those places I'm not trying\nto insult you because I had a good time\nthere and you might be a friend of mine\nfrom there but those are the five places\nI've been they really found that people\nweren't that super friendly but don't\nworry there's plenty of friendly people\nthat actually are in those countries so\nyou can meet them but also we have a\nlist in a video on the most friendly\nplaces we've been to and that V that\nlist is a lot longer cuz really I had to\nreally think about like five where I\nreally thought people weren't that\nfriendly it was actually kind of tough\nto come up with this one well not for\none of the places though or two actually\nbut anyway you get the idea what was the\nmost unfriendly place you've been to let\nus know in the comments below and tell\nus what happened to share your story\nabout why you thought it was so\nunfriendly and I'll say bye from here in\nFriendly Finland"

      "transcript": "what if I told you that what you read on\nthe Internet or maybe what you were\ntaught was totally wrong what if us as a\nmotorcycle Community have been looking\nat corner entrants the wrong way let me\nshow you what I mean\n[Music]\nwe are on the most epic Road in all of\nAmerica this is Beartooth pass Highway\n212 from cook City in the north corner\nof Yellowstone National Park to Red\nLodge Montana it reaches to 11 000 feet\nin elevation it's not the most technical\nor the most challenging but it is\nabsolutely spectacular\nit is the perfect Road for what we're\ngoing to be talking about today because\na mistake here can lead to dire\nconsequences I mean look at that don't\nmess that up\nnow I think we can all agree that\nrushing Corner entrance is bad we don't\nwant to go into any Corner faster than\nwe can see we've all been there we've\nall overcooked the corner entrance and\nwe can all agree that it's not fun\nbefore we get into what I really want to\nsay you can't make any kind of good\ndecision if you're looking at your front\nwheel so first and foremost get those\neyes up focus on where you are and what\nyou're doing\nso here we are at the entrance to one of\na one of a thousand blind corners on\nthis road if the prevailing thought is\nthat we need to be off the brakes before\ntipping and then gently accelerate\nthroughout the entire corner or even\nneutral throttle what is that entrance\nspeed if we're gonna say that we have to\nbe off the brakes at a certain point\nthat means that there's a definitive\nanswer you've never seen this corner\nbefore you have no idea what's on the\nother side of this corner it's been five\nyears since I've seen this corner I have\nno idea what's on the other side of the\ncorner is the speed limit or those\nCorner advisory speeds is that the\ncorrect speed that as long as we stay\nbelow that number everything is going to\nbe all right now imagine that it's\nraining or it's a super cold morning and\nthere's Frost in all the Shadows where\nyour tires are worn out what is the\nsuitable entrance speed now so right now\nwe're just sitting here looking at this\ncorner we have a lot of time to kind of\nprocess what we can see but when we're\nactually riding we have to make this\ndecision rather quickly we only have a\nfew seconds to decide what that suitable\nentrance speed is and making that\ndecision before we can see the exit of\nthe corner is like trying to predict the\nfuture I'm not very good at predicting\nthe future if I was I probably wouldn't\nhave spent those 10 000 Bitcoins on\nthose two supreme pizzas watch what\nhappens to my suspension if I try to get\nall my braking done before tipping you\nsee how the front just Springs back up\nthat unloads the front tire that reduces\nhow much grip we have watch what the\nforks do if I continue to break past\nCorner tip in and gradually decrease\nfront brake pressure as the motorcycle\nleans\nwhich one looks better to you which one\nwill give us more front tire grip\nnow this is going to sound super obvious\nbut bear with me because this is a a way\nto think about Corners a little bit\ndifferently Corner entrance it serves\nonly to get us pointed towards Corner\nexit that's it it's not a place to go\nfast it's not a place where we have to\nit's not a place where we have to be on\nthe throttle a certain point to maintain\nstability we need to get the motorcycle\nturned and pointed towards the exit no\nmatter what so how do we do that\nlight front brake pressure and we're\ntalking just a little bit of brake\npressure sometimes even just like half a\npercentage point just enough to turn on\nthat that brake light is enough to push\nthat front tire into the ground which\ngives us more grip and it helps the\nmotorcycle change direction\nmotorcycles are designed and engineered\nto work like this for a given lean angle\nspeed equals radius when we go to the\nfront brake the motorcycle wants to slow\ndown and turn neutral throttle or\nmaintenance throttle the radius stays\nthe same and when we start to accelerate\nwhen we start to add speed the\nmotorcycle stops turning and wants to\nrun wide\nuphill Corners are one thing they're\npretty easy all things considered\nbecause gravity is helping us manage our\nspeed it makes everything easier as\nwe're coming into this downhill corner\nthere's a lot going on the the best\nRiders the most talented riders in the\nworld use their brakes the most what\ndoes that mean I go to my break early I\ncarry it longer but with less pressure\nearlier lighter longer and that helps\nthe motorcycle change direction downhill\nCorner grab these constantly pulling us\nfaster but if I hold on to one or two\npercentage points of brake pressure not\na lot I'm not going to mash it just a\nlittle bit of brake pressure and it's\ngoing to control my speed which is going\nto control my direction and it makes the\nbeginning half of the corner the busy\npart of the corner it makes it a lot\nless frantic\nlook I know that a lot of you guys have\ntried this but found you end up over\nslowing for Corners so either you go\nback to trying to get off the brakes\nbefore Corner tip in or you push\nyourselves to break later or carry more\nspeed into the corners over slowing into\nCorners isn't a breaking problem it's an\neyes problem if we're over slowing that\nmeans we need to get our eyes up and\nlook for our exit sooner look every\nmotorcycle weeb wash go through this\ncorner has done exactly this they tip in\nearly and when they get to the point in\nthe corner where they can see the exit\nthey accelerate and every one of them\nhas crossed the center line or nearly\ndid so what's the difference the green\nbike is what every bike we've seen today\nhas done both bikes have visibility but\nonly one of them has direction we know\nwhat's going to happen when they\naccelerate the bike stops turning and\nwants to run wide compare that to our\nblue Rider by being a bit more patient\nand focusing on getting the bike turned\ntowards the exit they are now in a\nbetter position which bike is in more\ncontrol which bike can go faster if they\nwant to and which bike is also going to\nbe taking less risk we don't want to\nthink about this like it's an emergency\nresponse a reaction to other things\ngoing wrong this becomes our plan this\nbecomes what we plan to do into every\ncorner when we plan on these techniques\nit's way easier to be smooth smooth and\nprecise and controlled\nwe manage our speed and manage our\nDirection what does that mean exactly on\nthe racetrack we would talk about the\nApex the Apex being the point where\nwe're closest to the inside of the\ncorner that's less important here on the\nstreet we're thinking about that\ndecision point where can I see my exit\nwhere can I take away my lean angle\nthat's typically the point where we're\ngoing to turn the most finish up that\nturn and get that direction so our path\nto travel can often be very outside\noutside I have visibility then I come to\nthe inside and accelerate out of the\ncorner wait until we're actually\nphysically pointed\nthe direction we want to go out of the\ncorner before we actively accelerate the\nmeasure of a good Corner shouldn't be\nhow much you leaned or how much speed\nyou carried into and through the turn\nthe measure of a good corner is if we\ngot Direction before we started to\naccelerate\nas we use the front brake the motorcycle\nwants to slow down and turn neutral\nthrottle the radius stays the same when\nwe start to accelerate the motorcycle\nstops turning and starts to run wide\nthis should be a perspective change\nthink about and focus on getting the\nmotorcycle turned use up the entrance of\nyour corner to set up and prepare to get\nthe motorcycle pointed towards the exit\nTrail braking lines Apex is counter\nsteering this all exists to serve one\nprimary objective getting the motorcycle\nturned the exit is the only thing that\nmatters\nget the motorcycle turned no matter what\nsacrifice your corner entrance go slower\ntake it easier be more mellow get the\nmotorcycle pointed no matter what corner\nentrance serves only to get us to this\npoint our Corner exit\nforeign"
