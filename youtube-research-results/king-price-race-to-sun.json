      "transcript": "[Music]\na stunning Dawn over the Northwest\nProvince ahead of the 2024 King price\nrace to the sun this year the event had\ngained added luster as it doubled up as\nthe South African gravel championships\nunder the orices of psyching South\nAfrica the U Resort in scnv on the banks\nof the H beport dam was the start point\nfor the 165 km race which would end at\nSun City the strongest field in the\nhistory of the king price race to the\nsun was gathered mountain bikers Ries\ngravers all chasing a national champions\njersey in the numerous official racing\ncategories the notable absente in the\nmen's field was two-time defending\nChampion Matt beers who was campaigning\nwith great success in the USA this\nopened the way for any number of Top\nClass races to become the third National\ngravel Champion among them Jaden turlo\nrouso Becker and Mark britson yeah I\nthink uh we as honeycom already uh we've\ngot a really strong strong field in here\nuh I mean we've got four riders that\npotentially have the the ability to win\nthis race um yeah I've I've just been on\nthe bike now for about three and a half\nweeks so yeah for me it's a bit unknown\nterritory but it's still I'm excited\nwhen I on the start line I'll definitely\ngive it a go I think uh having some\nfriends or help um yeah last year it was\nkind of just game on from the beginning\nso it'll be interesting to see with no\nno mat beers to rip it apart to see what\nthe what the dynamic is super excited\nit's going to be really F to the first\norder Point expecting probably around\nlike 38k an hour average speed till till\nthe uh the second water point so yeah\ngoing to be fighting for position um\nmaking sure you at the front in the\npinch points and yeah going to be going\nto be a fun day out the forward Ranger\nLED them over the damn wall in the\nneutral section at high Pace insect\nSciences Keegan bonon into a solid\nRhythm early on as was honeycombes\nTristan noia last year's runner up to\nmat beers in the sa championships\nthey were on the hard and fast dirt\nroads along the britz canal irrigation\nsystem in near perfect weather\nconditions are set for a hard and fast\nrace with a total elevation gain of\n1,000 M over 100 miles and no\nsignificant climb to use as an attacking\nLaunchpad the race would come down to a\ntactical battle a war of attrition\nfought out at high\nPace sha nickb took early responsibility\non the front rard jansan rensburg on his\nwheel the ripple effect of the injection\nof speed at the front was seen at the\nback of the lead group as Riders fought\nto stay on the wheel of those ahead of\nthem it was a ferocious battle early on\nwith the teams like honeycomb able to\nuse their Superior numbers to put the\nsolo races under pressure no again\npushing the tempo and assessing the\ndamage besta was a man on a mission\nthough I saw in the beginning that the\nguys were reluctant to to keep on\npushing the pace so so there was a\nlittle um ditch in the road and I\nattacked up that little climb the\ntactics are going to be play a big role\ntoday um but I know we rode the course\nlast week and the course is quite rough\nthey said it's the roughest it's ever\nbeen but yeah I don't complain being a\nmountain Miker the rougher the better so\nyeah but we'll have to see um there's\ngoing to be a lot of tactics so\nyeah yako fake winner of the UCI grad at\nswb 100 recently was one of the quartet\nof Honeycombs big\nhitters eventually after around 20 1 km\ntwo men managed to forge a gap Chris\nuster and sha Nick bester a quick chat\nabout the tactics and then they got to\nwork each took a turn on the front to\ntry and prize open a decent Siz Gap over\nthe dangerous Chase pack the rough\nsurface evident and the constant moving\nup and down of the gravel\nbikes with the road pedigrees both were\nhappy on the shorter section of tarad\nthey were building a significant lead\nbut they had yet to reach the halfway\nmark so for now anyway the chasing pack\nwere not too\nconcerned Yer is a canny tactician and\nthe winner of the 223 K toown cycle tour\nthey swung into the halfway point at\nRico's Dam in perfect Unison they'd been\nout front for 56 km their lead over the\nbig bunch behind was 4\nminutes that Bunch was around 30 strong\nand contained some serious Firs that\nhammered along the rough gravel Farm\nroads Raina SK of Northwest University\nWas Alone 2 minutes behind the leading\npairs he came into the water point at\nhalfway Then followed the rest of the\nmain Bunch Marco you Mark britz and\nvessel butter at the sharp end sadly for\nuster his race winning hopes Came\nCrashing Down when he fell at the\nhalfway point a bit pill for the\nexperienced racer to swallow this left\nsha Nick B alone up front we worked\ntogether quite well until halfway\nthrough the race at the feed Zone um\nunfortunately when Chris grabbed a bagg\nhe the bag uh went into his wheel and he\ncrashed himself um so from there on it\nwas a long and lonely road uh all the\nway over the king of the Mountain uh\nuntil about 126 KS into the race and uh\nyeah I tried to keep on pushing I was\nhoping to stay in the lead until we hit\nthat tall section because then I had\nsome hopes of uh being able to sit in\nthe slip for uh quite a while so and\ntrying to recover but yeah they caught\nme on one of those uh tough drags that\nwas quite bumpy and my body was just\ntaking shots\nthe women's race set off just after the\nelite men again the cream of South\nAfrican Road and mountain biking had\npitched up to race for the prestigious\nnational champions Jersey won in 2023 by\nSharice Wate there were around 40 Riders\nand Wate was just one of a numerous\ncontenders in the 2024 race the top\nthree from last year's race Sarah Hill\nSam Saunders and kathern gain were in\nthe pack as was 2022 gravel Champion\nHaley PR and Young Daniel\nstrum yeah I'm feeling really ready\nexcited um it's a nice culmination of\nRoad Riders gravel Riders and mountain\nbikers so let's see who's going to come\nout on top so this will be my second\nrace to the sun uh the first one I\nactually did on a mountain bike so um I\nthink being on a gravel bike in itself\nwill just make the whole experience all\nthe more better um it's not a lot of\nclimbing in the race but it's uh by no\nmeans easier it's going to be very fast\nit's going to be very hard and yeah\napparently there's a new section uh\ntowards the end um which will I think\nspice things up little which I'm really\nlooking forward to and yeah just hoping\nit warms up\nsoon that it certainly did as the sun\nbeamed down on the fast charging Riders\nthe rapid rate at which gravel racing is\ncaught on in South Africa was evident in\nthe bikes being ridden no mountain bikes\namong the elite\nRacers Haley Breen ensuring she was well\nfueled a tricky skill at high speed on\nthese roads kaina had a taste of gravel\nracing in the states last year in the\nlifetime Grand Prix series Sam Saunders\non the front with Lisa bone as santon\nCity Cycle Nation behind her it was the\nfirst time on a gravel bike for strum\nwho was saunders's teammate in the\nefficient Infinity Insurance team then\nit was the turn of the defending race\nchampion Sarah Hill to go to the front\nleading a pack of 10 top\nwomen by the time they reached the\nhalfway point Cola had a small Gap but\nshe was closely followed by Sharice Wate\nand the rest of the hard chasing\npack Lisa bone just losing a little time\nas she collected her bottle In the Heat\nof the\nbattle back to the men's Elite race and\nthey were closing in on the Finish\nhammering along the smooth r556 towards\nSun City a group of 10 were together\nincluding two from Uka giant a couple\nfrom the honeycom squad honored a toy of\ninsect science for sobeck of Titan\nracing and lone Raiders yansin B and Yan\nvitam then a big attack by Marco Y and\nMark britson saw the pair escape the\nreduced bunch and as they worked\ntogether initially they built up a solid\npotentially race winning advantage\npreton of honeycomb is a former South\nAfrican road race champion and winner of\nthe Ry jobber 947 and cape on cycle tour\nhu of uko giant is a formidable force on\nthe mounted bike with a second place\nfinish at the atas extreme this year and\nthe Tanga treack he was also second at\nthe swbg 100 gravel race in the kuu\nrecently they had made their move at\nexactly the right place and did enough\nwork together to ensure that at least\none of them would take the\nwin water Point 5 comes after 153 km of\nriding the Bel lansburg Mountains will\nbe looming up ahead as will the Finish\nas you head along the tar Road of the\nr556 in a deviation from previous years\nthe final few kilometers of the king\nprice race to the sun takes in a gravel\nroad that snakes between the mountains\ntoward Sun City\nitself we got to the final T section and\nuh Maru backed off the back and I I saw\nhim and I jumped onto his wheel and then\nwhen he went I decided this is this is\nthe move and uh we I committed 100% And\nalso shout out to him I mean he also\nrode uh at full Tempo I knew I had to\ntake someone with me cuz it's just too\nfar to go\nsolo um yeah and then it was Mark and\nthen immediately my head I was like\ndon't really want to take him to the\nline so just kept riding a hard steady\nface coming into the finish uh the top\ncorner here the last U-turn Corner Maru\nand I I don't know we just got it wrong\nI pulled brakes and my wheel just went\nout underneath me so I came short Maru\nluckily also had a little of incident so\nI got onto the bike and uh clipped in\nand managed to managed to take the win\nyeah I think they pre-roe the course\nlast weekend definitely helped him I\ncould see that he knew the course um\ndown to the te where I was a bit more\nhesitant and didn't know what to\nexpect um but yeah still learning this\ngravel thing second race my tires were\nway too hard almost crashed a million\ntimes but yeah close race second yeah\nhoping the win comes soon yes it's\namazing uh it's been coming it's a long\nway coming um last year this time it was\nmy first race back after my injury and\nuh yeah two weeks ago One S B and for\nI'm very happy for Mark I mean he\ndeserves it he's also come from some\nissues um and then just to pull off the\nthird I'm super happy I couldn't have\nasked for more a thrilling end to the\nmen's Elite race and not far back the\nelite women were all together as they\napproached the drag queen of the\nmountains Cain Sanders Hill strum were\nlate and Breen all in the mix as was\nyoung Tyler Jacobs in the Tre colors it\nwas Freewheel psychology Rider PR who\nput in a surge at around 100ks and she\njust managed to snatch the queen of the\nmountains bonus ahead of Sharice Wate\none of the casualties of the injection\nof pace was Cain who lost contact with\nthe leading\nBunch the Relentless terrain perhaps the\ntoughest in the history of the event was\ntaking a heavy toll on the Riders and\ntheir bikes this was a true test of the\nbest perhaps no big mountains but the\nsurface certainly made up for that one\nby one the light started to go out this\nleft six Riders up ahead Sarah Hill\nlooking to defend her race title Daniel\nstrum hunting her first senior National\nTitle Haley Breen a former Champion\nformer Junior M bike Champion tyer Jacob\nSam Sanders and Sharice Wate there was\nquality here nothing to separate them as\nthey played a tactical game over the\nlast 20 km on the new dirt road finish\nstrum used her mbike skills and power to\nopen a gap and she managed to maintain\nit all the way to the line to take the\nwin by a couple of seconds from the\nmarauding bunch in the dust behind her\nto be honest I really wasn't sure it's\ngoing to happen this is my first gravel\nrace with a gravel bike I haven't done a\ngravel race on a gravel bike yet they've\nall been previously on my mountain bike\nso I was like okay now this is going to\nprobably I'll be able to see what it's\nlike and yeah it turns out it's quite an\nadvantage having the ride bike for the\nride race hats off to King price race\nthe sun Advent urance um yeah and\ncycling South Africa I'm super super\nhappy with the result and what a\nphenomenal race I was hoping to walk\naway with the title um but I'm still\nhappy with the it's a very flat race so\nlike it wasn't necessarily the hardest\nrace even though we're still tired now\nbut um yeah I'm I'm very happy with my\nresults Mark britson took the win in the\nmen's Elite race at the king price race\nto the sun in 4 hours 35 minutes and 52\nseconds just two seconds clear of Marco\nYar Britton's teammate fake was in third\na good result for Yan V in fourth 11\nseconds ahead of insect Sciences honor\nto toy a great mix of Ries Specialists\nand mountain bikers in the top 10 far\ntighter in the top five of the women's\nrace just 24 seconds between the winner\nand USA champion Daniel strum and sixth\nplace Sarah Hill the previous two\nChampions on the gravel were second and\nthird in rate and\nPR the king price race to the sun is\nwithout doubt a serious competitive race\nfor the top athletes but for many it's a\nlot more than that throughout the field\nthere were many heroic performances by\nRiders who pushed themselves to and in\nmany cases well beyond their perceived\nphysical and mental limits one such\nentrant was top South African triathlete\nHannah Newman who's used to Racing for\nthe win but the 2022 commonwealth games\ncompetitor and winner of the aurn\ngeneral extry in the same year used the\nrace to the Sun as a major stepping\nstone towards recovery after suffering\nlife-threatening injuries in an accident\nso it took me quite a while to get back\ninto training I obviously started\nbasically from square one again after my\naccident started with just walking\nwent into the pool the bike was the last\nthing I got back on um and I started\nwith maybe a 20 minute ride on my\nmountain bike um and I've just built up\nslowly week by week uh luckily I work\nvery closely with my coach um so he's\nbeen able to build me up really nicely\num I'm still a long way from where I'd\nhope to be but uh yeah it's it's it's\nnice to be able to even enter for an\nevent like this I didn't think I'd be\nable to do it so soon so my body's\ndefinitely strong and my mind is\nstronger so yeah I'm Ready the\npopularity of the king price race to the\nsun stems from its accessibility for all\ntypes of riders at the sharp end Ries\nand mounted bikers forth were the top\nplacings on their gravel bikes further\nback in the huge field were Riders who\ntackled the 160 km on their mounted\nbikes perhaps a good thing considering\nhow rough the route was in this year's\nEdition the chance to ride through the\nstunning farmlands of the region doesn't\ncome around often so while still keep\nkeeping a steady consistent Tempo they\ncould absorb the beautiful surroundings\nwith like-minded fellow Riders all at\ntheir own\npace the second water point at rudic\ncopy's dam was a critical phase in the\n100 mile race it came at the halfway\nmark around 49 Mi or 78 km it was a\nchance to rest and refuel to take stock\nof what was done and what remained to be\nridden and to assess the state of their\nbikes and bodies before tackling the\nsecond half which many said was the\ntougher of the two I'm not used to very\nlong distances maybe like 20 40ks so\nmade it halfway and the endurance is\nstarting to turn on now but the scenery\nup to here was really really amazing you\nget like this lack of Farm View\neveryone's in lack of mood it is very\nit's so worth it man and I mean the\nwater points who needs sweets and stuff\nyou got water points like that it's\ncrazy what can I uh do 100 m without\nwithout a doubt the the pants I mean\nyour bum will take a beating for 100\nmiles so has to be the pants is there\none essential item that you can't do 100\nmiles without is a spare butt can't go\nwithout my my electroly eh I will\ndefitely say at this stage cramp bees\nyou need cramp bees there's no ways uh\nI'll be able to do this uh without uh my\nhusband Chris alongside when we speak of\nrainbow Nation please come and and and\nexperience this here we we one family\nhere we one Community here or one nation\nhere or one\nlove never a true word spoken the king\nprice race to the sun is open to a huge\nvariety of riders if you're an endurance\njunkie or just fancy testing your\nstamina then the 100 m is the way to go\nbut it's a serious challenge one not to\nbe underestimated and requires committed\ntraining and good\npreparation if you're new to the sport\nor perhaps not yet in the condition to\ntackle the full distance then there's\nthe half distance 50 m which starts at\nthe ropies dam and finishes at Sun City\nit's an ideal way to get into gravel\nriding with not too much timing and\nlittle by way of technically challenging\nterrain from the outset event organizers\nfaces the built relationships with local\nresidents along the route that have\ninvolved the communities through which\nthe event goes wherever possible locals\nact as Marshals along the Route guiding\nthe Riders through the various turns and\ntracks the event has also introduced the\nsport of psyching to some communities\nwho would previously not have had any\nknowledge about it as a race and an\nevent and Through the Years some in\nthese communities have become inspired\nand motivated to take to a bike and\nperhaps take on the race to the Sun\nfaces\nyeah\nfrom and then\nwith this new initiative that we brought\ninto the race to the sun is that we\nbasically give back with uh socks uh so\nwith there's 3,000 pairs of socks that\nwe give back to the the community and\nthat's just such a beautiful story that\nwe can also use because it's going into\nthe into the winter season now and who\ndoesn't need a pair of socks so for for\nthat and also the employment and also\nthe the Deep deployment of all the\nmarshals out there from every single\nCommunity we thank you\n[Applause]\nover the entire route the water points\nwere all stocked with an amazing array\nof healthy nutritious and tasty food and\ndrink as well as having enthusiastic\nCrews helping out as they create a Cool\nvibe all of which gives the Riders a\nboost as they continue their Journey the\nmajor watero sponsors this year were a\nlocal company Mahal Citrus mahalis is uh\none of South Africa's largest and oldest\nuh citrus fruit juice\nmanufacturers uh and we've been around\nsince\n1959 so it's our uh 65th anniversary uh\ncelebrations this year so mahalis uh\nmanufactures about 18 million L of fruit\njuice concentrate uh each year both for\nlocal local and Export markets and if\nyou dilute that to a single strength\njuice uh you will get to more or less\n100 million lers of uh single single\nstrength fruit juice to drink this year\nwe've hosted four water points uh on the\nroute uh where we handed out about\n20,000 L of water and about 4,000\nbottles of fruit juice uh so hopefully\neveryone that passed uh the Water points\nuh had a good time at the at the fruity\nand feasty water points and uh yeah we\nhope to see you guys again next\nyear staging an event of this nature\nwould be very difficult if not\nimpossible without a loyal and generous\ntitle sponsor and King price Insurance\nwho've been associated with the sport on\nthe race for many years not only\nprovided umbrella sponsorship but their\nExecutives got to have an inperson\nexperience alongside the writers as they\ntackle the event as\nwell it is such a privilege for us to be\npart of such a prestigious event I mean\nthis is not easy people train very hard\nto finish this today it's an experience\nit's a life achievement for many Blood\nSweat and Tears that we see beyond the\nfinish so it it means a lot for us it's\nit's nice to be able to make this\npossible for the people out there we\nshould keep on doing this always make\nsure that your bicycle is ensured if you\nensure your car with King price you can\nadd that bicycle for one Rand if the\nvalue is right but we were always going\nto give you a good premium make sure\nthat you don't come out here without\nproper insurance on that bicycle the\nroad is difficult it's hard we saw many\nbikes tipping over today with damage on\non your baby make sure it's\ninsured Marin if if today was a song\nwhat song would it\nbe another one bites the dust was there\na lot of dust out there yeah and sand\nbut today's sand was yeah was very very\ntough and the sun was not forgiving it's\na said I would I would encourage anyone\nand everyone to come and and try this\nit's a nice it's a nice day out was\npeaceful the race was well organized we\nhad enough cuts on the road we had\nenough Marshalls we had enough rescue\nguys the water points were well uh\nfinished so it was proper I usually say\nit's a 160 km Journey from Haram\nschumans Ville all the way through to\nbeest and then traveling all the way\nback to the beautiful host of Sun City\nResort the things that we up this year\nis we use communities empowerment we use\nthe we use them as Marshals all around\nthe route there's exceptionally well\ntrained SAA Vehicles think bike vehicles\nand this year Metro from the local\ngovernments also just brought it all\ntogether the dust has settled the\nbearings have seized muscles have\ncramped and the sun has now set on sunet\nthe 2024 King price race to the sun with\neverything thing that we dreamed it was\ngoing to be the sa gravel Champs titles\nattracted the best Riders from around\nthe country and boy did we get

      "transcript": "Case of the Sun is the first proper\ngravel race that South Africa actually\nhad. Um I don't really think there was\nthey introduced the gravels scene more\nto South Africa than any other race. I\nmean I feel all the other races built\nonto this race. Gravel racing is great.\nIt's accessible for mountain bikes, um,\nbut the real gravel racers as well, the\nelite riders. And I think this one\nespecially because it caters for like\nthe whole range. Um, amateurs up to the\nelite category. Um, yeah. So, I think\nit's really great. It's great to have\nmore grand races on the calendar, good\nprize money, um, good organization,\ngreat vibes. With the competition we're\nfacing this weekend,\num, we're going to have to see how it\ngoes. Yeah.\nIt's really situational. If it comes to\n1v3 versus Honeycomb, for example, then\nyou have to approach it completely\ndifferent. Having Kasper and Yaku and\nand myself together again, I mean, we've\nraced a lot together over over the years\nand we know each other very well and we\nhave a good understanding of the race.\nWe always just race the race as it\ncomes. Uh, obviously after 3 hours,\neverybody gets tired and I think it\nsuits us a bit more. The longer it gets,\nthe better. Super excited to be back.\nThe guys are super strong. I'm not\nreally sure what to expect, but um yeah,\nI just follow and see where we can come.\nUm it's going to be a good day out.\nHopefully, we can show our name on the\nfront somewhere. For me personally, it's\nthe the original gravel race of South\nAfrica. Good morning and welcome to the\n2025 King Price Race to the Sun. We're\nhere at Hotbeasport Dam. We finish at\nthe beautiful Sun City. 162 km, just\nunder 1,000 m of climbing. The route is\nbackloaded and there's a lot of new\nexciting pieces on the second half of\nthe racing today. Mark Pritson is here\nto defend his title from Honeycomb\n226's. The women's field is wide open.\nSam Saunders, Sarah Hill, Shereice\nWilllet, and Haley Pin is back from\ninjury. All the usual suspects are here\nin the men's race. It's going to be a\ngreat day. This is Gravel at his\nabsolute best.\n[Music]\nThe faces adurance team had taken into\nconsideration the concerns and\nsuggestions from riders after the 2024\nrace and had made some significant\nchanges to the route. The first half is\nunchanged as they ride along the Brits\ncanal system below the dam. Water point\none at 52 and a halfway point at 76\nkilometers are familiar. Through the\ncooperation and help of local farmers,\nproblematic road works have been\navoided. Add to that a loop through the\nSadiba quail adventure center on a\ncompact gravel section and the\nelimination of long sections of\ncorrugated roads and the riders were in\nfor a safe and thoroughly enjoyable race\nover 100 or 50 miles.\nThe elite men rolled away first,\nfollowed by the big group of elite\nwomen. The initial few kilometers to the\ndam wall were neutral behind the Ford\nRanger. Despite the presence of low\ncloud, the prospect of rain was very\nunlikely. The weather was perfect for\nthe country's top riders to engage in a\nfierce battle over the fast and fun\ncourse to Sun City. Riders with previous\nexperience here were hoping to put those\nlessons to good use.\nSo, having done this race previously,\nI've made a few mistakes.\nUm, last year I got a puncture like 30ks\nin. Obviously, it was SA Champs, so that\nwas quite um devastating for me because\nI felt I had a good chance. Um, this\nyear I'm really looking to to better\nthat finishing position. Um, I think it\nwill be a fun day out. Um, I'm going to\nkeep smooth lines and uh, yeah, be\ntowards the front. With the elite men up\nthe road, the big elite women's batch\nwas heading away from the start. Among\nthem, previous winners Sarah Hill and\nSam Sanders of Efficient Infinity\nInsure. Second last year, Sharice\nWilllet of Toyota Specialized and the\nrecently crowned national champion Haley\nPin of Honeycomb 26s.\nUm, Race of the Sun is it's an annual\ngravel event that I wouldn't want to\nmiss. Even having moved to the Western\nCave, I still come back here to do this\nyear, this race. Um, the vibe is so\ncool. The women who show up are really\ncool. And this year, it's going to be a\nfast year. So, it's not an easy win for\nanyone on the start line. Very strong\nfeel today. Uh, I really do expect some\nfireworks between Haley and Samantha\nSaunders. Um, you know, even at marathon\nchamps, they were giving each other a\nproper go. Sarah Hill also proving that\nshe's very strong at the starting to\nsee. Sheresa is a sneaky rider. Um, we\nall have to look out for her. I know\nlast year we got played by some road\ntactics, so it's interesting to see how\nit goes. And then of course my favorite\nteammate Sam Sanders. She's she's always\nsomeone to be reckoned with at Race to\nthe Sun. You never know where she's\ngoing to go. Um but she has an engine to\npull us all from A to B. So how will we\nplay it this year? I'm not exactly sure.\nUm, I think going over the com like\nmaybe you could get away, but I'd like\nto try get away at some point, but I\nthink it is difficult for a solo finish\nbecause it's a flatter race, but I'll\ndefinitely try. I'll try as much as I\ncan. Um, it's safer to be on your own.\nSo, yeah, it will definitely be a goal\nfor today's race to try to get away at\nsome point. It's road racing a little\nbit. There's tactics involved and the\ntruth is that you just you never know.\nYeah, I know. It's going to be very\nimportant. I think uh Jan's a bit of a\ndark horse, so we can play some good\ntactics. Uh super strong at the moment\nand looking forward to seeing what we\ncan do today.\nYour degree of of focus in this race is\nis linked directly\nto your determination to do well. I\nthink if you are driven to see it\nthrough to the end, the focus is\ninstinctive. You require more focus in\nthe first half of the race than the\nsecond. Generally, we're a smaller\ngroup, riders we know, and we just tend\nto to jel better. So, so then it's a\nlittle bit simpler.\nSo, um, very fast first half. Um, and I\nthink that's where you kind of have to\nto save a little bit. Um, I think it's\nvery easy to spend too much energy in\nthe first half. So, yeah, they really\nneed to also be at the front. You need\nto to keep your width about to to not be\ntoo far at the back. And then you're\nhalfway through you kind of conserve a\nlittle bit of energy. Then you have that\nkicker for the queen of the mountain,\nking of the mountain. Um, that's\nactually tougher than it looks. But the\ncorrugation a massive massive factor at\nthis race. Um, so even though it's not a\nlot of elevation, it was one of the\ntoughest races that I did the whole of\nlast year. Um, hands cramped, feet\ncramped, my calves cramped. So yeah, uh\nlike I said, it's you have to save\nenergy and you have to keep on feeling\nthe whole\ntime. The relentless pace at the front\nover the first half of the race thinned\nthe group down to only the strongest\ncontenders as they approached the\nhalfway mark at\nPiercra. Stand's Nadia Stler led them in\nwith Sarah Hill. Haley Pin, Sherice\nWilllet, Bianca Nell, and Sam Saunders\nnot far off. A swift bottle change and\nrefuel, and they were soon back on the\nroad.\nToday I'm here doing Race to the Sun.\nI'll be doing the 100 mile lap. We've\nresearched it. We enjoy the scenery. Uh\nwe've looked at a lot of previous um\nrides and what's been put on Facebook\nand it just really looks like an\nenjoyable day out and that's why we\nwe've also chosen this race. There's a\nlot of support. Everyone's very\nfriendly. It's like makes you feel you\nwant to do this and the people around\nyou are inspiring and then the people\nalong the route are also very\nsupportive. All the water points there's\na lot of cheer. It's very nice. I'm just\nlooking to enjoy it. Me and my bicycle.\nI'm just looking forward to enjoy the\nBoom.\nI'm the pastor of this congregation.\nWe've got two service points. On Sunday\nmornings, I preach here and we uh for\nfor from the beginning we did all this\nuh um drinking points or the water\npoints and every year I just check out\nthe cyclist and I just think it looks\nnice. I must try it. I think the whole\ncongregation don't think I'm going to\nmake it. So, uh I'm going ahead and I\njust enjoy to be 55 and just do this.\nSo, I I enjoy it thoroughly. Thanks a\nlot.\nWe're halfway through with the big men.\nI mean, both of us 100 kg plus. So,\nthese are big boys, but they're doing a\nstellar job. We're averaging a 25 80ks\nin. So, 80ks to go. So, Rof, how are you\nfeeling? Nah, 80ks to go. And I need to\nsend my mom a quick email telling her\nthat to let her know, mom, we're on our\nway. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Feel like a\ncoffee ride. Yeah. So, I'm feeling good.\nThe water points are well stocked with\nfood, so we are able to fill up and not\nbonk. You know, the food is great. I\nmean, we're all stacked with all our\nenergy bars and all our sachets, but I\nmean, you barely need it with, you know,\nall of\nthis. Good afternoon. I'm Lawrence\nFoster, owner of Cityqule. the route is\npassing close to us. And this year we\ndecided to let them in and enjoy the\nnature and just some farms and maybe\nthey can see some wild animals. And uh\nwhat we do basically is hosting school\ncamps and school groups and it's all\nclose to close to town and inside here\nthey just have a adventure camp,\nleadership camps and to have the cyclist\nhere today is is awesome to share it\nwith them. So inside I can expect some\nwildlife.\nbirds, uh, impala, giraffes, kudos,\nwaterbuck. So, it's it's a nature\nreserve and uh no any animals that can\nharm them or anything like that. They\nwill be safe inside the the\nreserve. Back with the men's race and\nMark Pritson had made a searing attack\nand was out on his own with the king of\nthe mountains up ahead. The honeycomb\n226's rider had overcome a fall and was\nriding like a man\npossessed. Behind him the chase was on.\nUrustil and insect science were\ndesperate to close the gap. Also there\nyandavilia chinola waist. Sitting on and\nenjoying the ride and watching the fight\nwere Pritzen's teammates Kaspar and\nYakaf. Ace worked very hard for his man\nTuro. They knew the danger of letting\nthe Pritsen powerhouse get away.\nHeat.\nHeat. Heat. Heat.\nYeah, it was a long day. Uh I had a\ncrash going through a river crossing and\nuh I was quite upset after that and I\nthought, yeah, I pretty much thought it\nwas over after that and I lost all my\ngels and everything and then I just\ndecided, you know what, I'm going to\nmake this race as hard as I can for my\nteammates. I didn't expect it right\naway, but I did. Mark crashed, um, on a\nbit of a weird place. Then, um, he came\nto me halfway into the race and he said\nto me, he's just going to go for an\nattack and see how it goes. He's not\nbecause after the crash, he didn't feel\ntoo great. Um, and then here near the\nend, I was just waiting for the right\nmoment. And normally this last section\nis quite tough. So, I just put\neverything in and yeah, got through for\nthe for the second place. The guys were\noneing me. Um, and at some point\nsomebody said to me, \"Han, Keegan's\ncoming.\" So, I think, uh, that's\nprobably the most impressive ride cuz,\nuh, Keegan must have for at least an\nhour been on his own and had a push in\nexcess of 400 watts consistently. So,\nyeah, that I was a bit uncertain and\nthen I saw Keegan. I got a whole boost\nof energy and I was no longer alone and\nit caused confusion in the group. So,\nyeah, it was fantastic. I think Keegan\ndid\nwell. The women's race was boiling up to\nbe an absolute thriller. 2022 winner Sam\nSaunders looking as strong as ever, but\nperhaps weary of going alone too early.\nThe chase group was on high alert.\nGreen, Willlet, Strickler, and Hill as\nwell as Nell were in close attendance.\nIt was tense and high tempmpo racing at\nits best. Each rider knowing the other's\nstrengths and weaknesses almost as well\nas their own. Leaving a water point,\nSharice Willlet slipped out on a loose\ncorner and went down. Fortunately for\nthe Toyota Specialized rider, no serious\ndamage to body or bike and she was soon\nup and riding. A champion racer, she\nshowed her composure and experience as\nshe got back to work to reconnect with\nthe leaders. Sarah Hill was also bearing\nthe scars of an early fall. She was off\npace. Ever the competitor Haley Breen\nseven years pace on the Queen of the\nMountains ascent to collect the bonus\nprize. The splash and scramble through\nthe river saw Pine Sanders and Willlet\nin the lead. It was riveting racing, all\nchasing the glory of victory, but there\nwas late drama for two of the riders.\nTheresa and I actually opened up a bit\nof a gap and then uh we turned the wrong\nway. Yeah, you know, it's it is what it\nis. Um, of course, terribly\ndisappointed. I think I'm still\nprocessing\nit. You know, what can you do? They come\ndown into the finishing straight and\nshe's headed sold in the head. What a\ngreat finish in 2025. Haley Pin is the\nqueen. Sam Saunders goes second. Sharice\nWilllet goes\nthird. It was a long day. Um but yeah,\nwe all rode very well together. Sam,\nShereice, myself, we had Sarah for a\nlong time as well. Um yeah, it was a\nvery good day. I'm happy to feel good on\nthe bike and yeah, happy to take the\nwin. I loved it all. It's really cool,\nwell marked. Um, except for my eyes\nclearly, but no, you know, the guys at\nFaces always put on a good show. Um, but\nit was just really nice to have a a good\nbunch of ladies on the start and um, you\nknow, we all race hard so um, I I\nappreciate that. Yeah. No, it was really\ngood. Um, I really enjoyed it. It was\nstill very hard. Uh the corrugation\nobviously still plays a quite a big\nfactor, but yeah, the new route through\nthe reservoir, it was actually very\nnice. Also passing some of the other\nriders and being able to cheer each\nother on a little bit of single track\nand yeah, you know, the route has\nsomething for everyone.\nMark Pritson made it two in a row the\nKing Price Race to the Sun with a fierce\ndisplay of power riding. Yakafan Lake\nand Yan Vitar joined him on the podium.\nBehind them, it was a who's who of\nformer champions across road, mountain\nbike, and the gravel disciplines. The\nmisfortune of a wrong turn was costly\nfor Sanders and Willlet and national\nchampion Haley Pin capitalized and made\nit a double for the Honeycomb 226's\nteam. Just 4 seconds was her winning\nmargin. 2023 winner Sarah Hill fought\nback to take fourth ahead of Nadia\nStookler, who only began racing bikes\nthree years ago. Cla Malik in seventh\nwas the last of the women under 6 hours.\nUh so last Sunday it was actually a year\nwhen\nFranchi tently lost his life. But today\nwe as a group of friends and people at\nwork that come in a memory for of his\nlife to to compete the race for him\nbecause he couldn't compete myself also.\nSo yeah, we are here to complete the\nrace for Francher. The guys chase the\nroute. Um the hill will be after his\nname, the Front Mini Hill. And at the\nsplit, it's approximately about 8K to\nthe point where he lost his light. So we\ngoing to put the F and M that we cut out\nof wood against the tree. So yeah, this\njust in memory. That's it. Remember\nWell, we're the middle of nowhere about\n40ks away from Sun City. Uh on a\nwonderful day out doing Race of the Sun.\nUm my wife, it's her first ultra. Um, I\nhaven't done this race in six years, so\nit's amazing to be back. This is just um\nsomething out of this world. Um, this is\nmy first time doing a race like this and\nuh the distance as well. So, it's really\nreally an awesome experience. Yeah,\nsomething worth it.\nIt's very cool to see the communities\nand how they live in Scrap. It's just a\nbeautiful type side of the world and uh\nyeah, it's stuff that you wouldn't\nnormally go and watch or see anyway. and\nwe get to see it all in this race. So,\nyeah, it's nice, tough, but as expected,\nI think um see this those are the guys.\nIt's first time doing it and they're\nenjoying it, but the smiles are getting\nless now. I'm having the best time. It\ndoesn't feel like I've done 120k so far\nand I kind of I don't really want it to\nend yet. So, really really enjoying it\nso far. Oh, it's amazing. I love the\npeople. I love the energy.\nThis is Yan Mi. We're doing the race to\nthe sun all the way from Artes Purdam to\nSun City. Sport in general brings people\ntogether, but cycling especially because\nall body body sizes like me can do\ncycling even if your knees are bugged.\nSo um the fact of the matter is um I\nmean if you're tired, you're tired.\nDoesn't matter who you are. And uh\npeople have a very good empathy and\nsympathy for that. So I think that's\nthat is the the at the base the thing\nthat makes sport\nspecial. This is a journey you know the\njourney all the way from heart to be to\nhere. But the real beauty of it is that\nfamilies that are waiting for people at\nthe finish line, bring the kids, come to\nthe Valley of Waves, stay overnight. So\nit really is a race with quite a\ndifference. And of course, we really\nfocus around the finish experience.\nWe've got entertainment in there, we've\ngot food, we've got air con. So, so when\nyou get off after that 160 ks, you know,\nit's uh it's a great experience. And I\nthink the Bob Post race is something\nwe've really focused on.\nYeah. And I would just like to finish\nthis off with uh to say a big thank you\nto King Bryce and their vision into our\nsuccess at this event. Without them,\nit's almost physically impossible\nbecause they're also part of the client\nengagement and the participant\nexperience. But yeah, and uh for the\ncommunities that is involved from Brits\nto Mukquas to to the local uh uh\ncommunities here in Sun City, uh it's an\nincredible journey that we've been taken\non. But lastly but not least is for you\nthe athletes. Well done. It's a such a\ngreat uh acknowledgement to know that we\nas organizers can make you finish here\nat S Park. It's a fantastic race. It's a\nendurance ride. So yeah and it's well\nadvertised. So that's why we we come\nhere for it. Yeah. I heard about it two\nweeks ago. So just went on the gut and\nsigned up for it. There were a few times\nthat I thought I'm going to just get off\nthe bike and call it a day but somehow\nwith the grace of the Lord we pulled it\nthrough. I could remember at some point\nuh between 90 and 120 I felt like I went\nto a dark place. I had to stop for 5\nminutes and I give myself some pep talk\nand from there I came out of it and I\nthoroughly enjoyed it throughout. You\nfeel sad, you go on your bike, you come\nback feeling brand new. Cycling has\nliberated me. Just a wonderful race. Um\nI'll be back again. The support from\nKing Price absolutely amazing. It was\nawesome.\nCongratulations on your finish at the\n2025 King Price Race to the Sun. What a\nday it's been. Absolutely glorious\nweather and incredible racing. The\nchanges to the route have been very well\nreceived. Mark Pritson goes back to back\nand doubles up on his win from last year\nwith a breakaway of over 110 kilometers\nto take the win for Honeycomb 226's.\nHaley Pin back from injury, broken\ncollarbone, and she snuck in just ahead\nof Sam Saunders and Sheree Willlet in\nthe Elite Women's Race. Congratulations.\nWhat a day. We cannot wait to see you\nnext year.\nHeat. Heat. N."
