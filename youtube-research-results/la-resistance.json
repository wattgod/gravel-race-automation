Today we have a close look at the gravel section which joins the two sides of the climb. Join me for future videos https://www.youtube.com/@CyclingInTheAlps&quot;Sub_Confirmation=1&quot;\n\n\nThe south side of Plateau des Glieres has been used twice in the Tour de France and also featured in the 2018 Etape du Tour from Annecy to Les Grand Bornand.\n\nToday I'm riding the climb from the north side of Plateau des Glieres before reaching the summit and traversing the alpine gravel section to the tarmac of the south side. This ride is doable from the  Chamonix Mont-Blanc region combining both a stunning road ride and a gravel section suitable for most road bikes. The gravel ride, the World War 2 history of Plateau des Glieres and the stunning scenery combine for an epic gravel road bike adventure. \n\nPlease click this link to discover more about Plateau des Glieres during World War 2 https://www.plateaudesglieres.fr/le-territoire/histoire-du-plateau/\n\nRiding from Annemasse - host town of the 2023 Etape du Tour, is not too far before you reach Thorens Glieres and the start of the climb from the north side. Over the top and you drop down to the les Grand Bornand to Bonneville road making a great circuit even adding in the Col des Aravis and the Col de la Colombiere.\n\nIts a difficult climb on both sides and ramps up steeply. \n\nCycling inspiration music promoted by EpidemicSound.com\n\nCycling in the Alps is brought to you from our base at the foot of Mont Blanc close to Chamonix, France.

      "description": "Chris Froome having some issues on this limestone-gravel section of the stage. \n(The remote plateau was important to the French resistance and to refugees. It was the site of a military disaster for the resistance in March 1944, losing 120-odd men killed in fighting, executed after capture or not surviving deportation, as it pulled out of the plateau, outnumbered by Vichy French government forces and the German army. The German army lost 3 men. Two thirds of the resistance force were captured. Denunciation by collaborators played a part. Nonetheless the events may have helped the resistance win over public opinion and provoke greater assistance from the allies. After the war General de Gaulle encouraged the growth of a myth of a great resistance battle (eventually debunked by historians) and the plateau became a spiritual home of resistance memory, site of the monument national de la R\u00e9sistance, and, as one sees in this clip, it remains so.)",
