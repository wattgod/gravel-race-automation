      "transcript": "foreign\nmusician I have played loads of music\nfestivals however I have never been to a\ncycling Festival I'm not aware of\nanything existing like this for road\nracing or time trialing or even\nTriathlon maybe there's a bit of a gap\nin the market there but grip Fest is in\nmid Wales in the Cambrian mountains it's\nrun over three days Friday Saturday\nSunday and includes seven time sections\nwithin those three stages not that I was\nthere to do any kind of racing after\narriving on the Friday headed off to do\nthe short 5K prologue section which\ninvolves some pretty gnarly and some\npretty technical sections and really\nshowed what those amazing Riders can do\nwith their bikes it was time to head\nback to the campsite have some food and\nget ready for the first proper stage on\nSaturday\n[Music]\ndate was a 65 kilometer 1350 meter\nclimbing day and after meeting up with\nloads of other club mates before the\nstart of the stage we headed out and\nrode up to the dam and onto some amazing\ngravel tracks\ngoodbye dude\nyeah I do know the area fairly well but\nfrom Road riding mainly not on the\ngravel and these incredible Trails\nthrough woods and around reservoirs gave\nme an overwhelming sense of freedom\nwas nothing like the technicality that\nwe saw in the prologue and the legs were\nfeeling good as we approached the first\ntime section now on the Saturday and the\nSunday the first time sections had some\npretty big cues waiting 35-40 minutes to\nget started\n[Applause]\nonce we've got going though Katie caught\nme very quickly from behind sat on my\nwill for the briefest of moments before\ngoing around me and I managed to just\nabout stay on her wheel\nat the end of that time section saw us\nfour up clubmates like a team time trial\nmaking it through to the Finish\nhaving hit that section fairly hard as a\nteam we decided we were going to take it\neasier if we were going to survive to\nthe end of the day one thing that didn't\nsit brilliantly with me and this is a\npersonal thing was the amount stopping\nthat we were doing we had to stop at the\nstart of the time sections to get going\nand then what we found we were doing was\nstopping at the end of the time sections\nfor everybody to regroup and then\nusually fairly shortly after that was a\nfeed station and we'd stop there my body\ndoesn't really work very well we're\nstopping very much and I think if I come\nback next year I'm just going to keep\nriding\ntowards the end of Saturday's stage was\nan insane climb it was completely brutal\nand nobody was talking to each other and\nwhat followed was an insane descent even\nsome of the best descenders I've seen\noff-road Riders were really struggling\nwith that and then shortly after this\nwhen I got back onto the road I started\ngetting cramped in both legs and really\nstruggled to get back without really\ngetting into some difficulty\nwell done Dave good work mate\ngood work\nexcuse the crazy red light is the um\nwe'll just call it pop top crikey with\nme and Dave Katie and Chrissy just got\nback from the first proper stage of\num grit Fest\nprologue yesterday which was Hardcore\nsuper hardcore like single track if any\nof you have been tashed in court those\nkind of single track Burmy type things\num but always crazy climbs\nbefore and after and during them it was\nmental 5K quite worrying actually it was\ngoing to be like that today but it\nwasn't 65k of kind of more gravel track\nstuff but by God 13 1350\nmeters of climbing or something in 65k\nand it was just yeah it was really hard\nwork anyway me and Dave are going to get\ninto the river which is that way down\nbottom of the campsite and then just\ntrying to get rid of this crap terrible\ncramp at the end anyway now's not the\ntime\nto be talking about this\num because\nwe are\nall just\na little bit broken\nhaving a nice time Dave oh no this is\njust what I told you ordered oh how did\nyou find that go on yeah it was all\nright I was just kind of getting to the\npoint where I was ready to get off my\nbike and the end I really was I really\nwas but it was great it was friendly and\nRuth was awesome and\nbut yeah I think it was a shark bought\ninto sharp Focus how perhaps you know\nyou need to do a little bit more uphills\na bit more climbing a bit more climbing\nfor me what was highlighter what's best\nfit for you do you know what I think the\nfact is that you can uh do what you need\nto do from a racing point of view but\nstill ride with your mates in between\nstages right I think that actually\num is a bit of a game changer because\nyou're not spending all your time off\nthe back\nin between you know what I mean yeah\ndefinitely would have been today yeah\ngood point uh what was the toughest bit\nthat final Hill final client that was\njust Rocky and then turned into just\nsome sort of Shirley Shady uh nightmare\nwhich I regard you as being a hell of a\nsort of off-road Defender and you found\nthat tough right it was that was pretty\nGrim wasn't it so ripping on with pretty\nmuch every part of my body yeah yeah it\nhad its moments today didn't it it\nreally did and this is great this is a\nchance to get our legs\nuncramped hair\nafter an evening of chatting drinking\neating and fighting midges we woke up in\nthe morning to find that Chrissy and\nKate's car had let him down they weren't\ngoing to be joining us for the stage\nnow let's very briefly talk about this\nchap here\nMatt Page is a genuine endurance Rider\nnot like a lot of these people you hear\non YouTube that claim they are this guy\nis the real deal now over the entire\nweekend he worked tirelessly checking\npeople in checking them out making sure\neveryone was okay even down to the point\nof making sure that there wasn't a\nsingle bin that was overflowing and\nchanging bin liners relentlessly this is\nthe kind of work ethic that sees you\nachieve the types of things that Matt\nPage has huge respect hi Dave how you\ndoing buddy thank you so far give us a\nrundown bury them while you're dripping\nand sweat already here very much uphill\nstraight away straight away any warm up\nno no Walmart\nwe're going up one of these and down\nthem and then up them and then down them\nso far so good they feels good nice day\nand after setting off onto some fairly\nsteep Road climbing we went straight\ninto some pretty unrideable tracks not\njust for me for everybody and that was a\nlittle bit worrying to kick off with\nhowever it soon opened out into the most\nincredible amazing climb up the side of\na mountain people were struggling in the\ndays of Endeavors the day before we're\nletting them down but my legs felt good\nand it was good to see and have a quick\nchat to some members from Porters head\nCycling Club\nand the rest of the day well you can\nonly really film so much Beauty it was\nmore of the same just relentlessly\nincredible Trails great fun great\ncompany and just the most amazing\nexperience I think I've ever had on a\ngravel bike and possibly riding for a\nweekend anywhere\nso then it was a race back to the van\nand time to head home\ngritfest done Dave what do people need\nto do they need to they need to\nsubscribe they need to click the Bell\nthey need to watch his videos\nhonestly it's been brilliant thanks for\na lovely trip mate I'm sorry I'm sorry"
