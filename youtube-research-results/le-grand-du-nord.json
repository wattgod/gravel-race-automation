      "description": "The Le Grand Du Nord is a gravel cycling event that takes place in northern Minnesota, United States in the Lake Superior harbor town of Grand Marais. The event is held on the Saturday of Memorial Day weekend annually.  \n\nAbout the course. It is a challenging and adventurous ride that showcases the scenic beauty of the region with Lake Superior and boreal forest views. Participants navigate a mix of gravel roads and some pavement while tackling various climbs and descents. \n\nAbout the race. The first Le Grand Du Nord was held in 2016 with less than 200 riders. Since then, it has strategically grown to 700 riders. The event was founded and is run by Jeremy Kershaw of Heck of the North Productions. Heck of the North organizes three other gravel grinder endurance races in Northern Minnesota.\n\n#gravelbike #endurancecycling #lakesuperior #visitcookcounty #donorthmn\n#northshoremn #bikerace #biking #bikelover #minnesota #onlyinmn #grandmarais",
