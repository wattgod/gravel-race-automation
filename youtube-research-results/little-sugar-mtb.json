Sitting just outside the top ten in the Grand Prix standings, this was his chance to claw back valuable points before the series finale next weekend at Big Sugar.\n\nFollow along as we capture the highs, lows and carnage from one of the wildest races of the year.

      "transcript": "[Music]\nIt's hard to believe we're already at\nthe last two stops of the Lifetime Grand\nPrix. Feels like just yesterday we were\nin Monterey, California for the start of\nthe season at the Sea Otter Classic.\nWe're here in Bentville, Arkansas for\nthe last two rounds of the Lifetime\nGrand Prix. This weekend we're racing\nmountain bikes at the Little Sugar. Next\nweekend we're racing gravel bikes for\nBig Sugar.\nWhat's neat about Little Sugar and Big\nSugar is they're backto-back race\nweekends, meaning we have two chances\nwithin 7 days to prove ourselves and\nclimb as much as possible in the\nLifetime Grand Prix rankings. It's sort\nof been a season of up and downs and\nright now I find myself in 11th place\njust outside the money. So these next\ntwo races are a good opportunity to\nhopefully move up the rankings. So ahead\nof me I've got Alex Wild two points up.\nBehind me I've got no shortage of strong\nguys. Sean Finch Champ two points behind\ntied with Matt Wilson. Matt Wilson's a\nmountain biker. Sean's a mountain biker.\nSo I assume I imagine these next two\nweekends will be good for both of them.\nBehind them we have Pacin, Cole, and\nSkyler. All within striking distance.\nBetween ninth and 15th are pretty wide\nopen at the moment.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, those are some good dudes. All the\npressure,\nbut diamonds are made under pressure.\nBoy,\n&gt;&gt; man, we're ahead of schedule. When are\nwe going to leave at 1?\n&gt;&gt; 12:45.\nOh, Toby and I are extremely excited to\nbe leading the Little Sugar\n&gt;&gt; Lifetime Grand Prix Shakeout Ride.\n8 miles of Bentville's finest single\n&gt;&gt; drive\nnever broke so well. No, don't kiss. the\nsnow. Don't you kiss and tell the don't\nyou kiss and tell the don't you kiss and\ntell\ngot to warm down. Warm down is the\nphysical part of Z warm up. Do you get\noffended when people talk that way since\nyou're actually European?\n&gt;&gt; That was Europe.\n&gt;&gt; Well, now I must go have chocolate\ncigarettes.\n&gt;&gt; You\n[Applause]\n[Laughter]\nGet him.\n&gt;&gt; Tell me the stats.\n&gt;&gt; The stats. 63.3 mi, 5,600\nft of climbing. I mean, look at this\nprofile. It's just a a saw tooth. You go\nup. It's just up and down all day. You\nrarely climb more than\na minute and a half, if that, which\nmeans you never really descend more than\n20 seconds. So, it's a real test of\ncornering skills. Um, riding flowy and,\num, basically who can do 3030 is the\nlongest.\nLedges is where I envision the race\nblowing up the most. Like that's where\nthere'll be a lot of small selections\nthroughout the day, but ledges is just\nit's carnage.\nSo\nguys, start at 8. What time you uh how\nare you going to get to the start?\n&gt;&gt; Probably just ride. I ride biking.\n&gt;&gt; The parking over there we think is going\nto be pretty bad. We're like a little\nbit concerned about that. So, we're\ngoing to do our best, you know, to get\nin there. I mean, it's us three. Paige,\nBria. So, we have we have a lot of\nhands. So,\n&gt;&gt; throw a dumb bottle at the end.\n&gt;&gt; Throw a dumb bottle in there. Yeah. On\nthree. 1 2 3.\nI'm bringing a lot of spare equipment\nwith me because I think there's going to\nbe a lot of carnage out there. You just\ngot to be prepared for anything because\nwith so many points on the line, so much\ncan happen. I would argue that this race\nis going to have the most carnage of any\nlifetime Grand Prix races. Way more so\nthan Unbound more than like Leadville.\nWith the Leadville, it's more body\nexplosions out there. here. It's just\nkeeping air in your tires, not breaking\nequipment, not crashing. Do you have\nmore CO2 here?\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.\nCan I just have one, please?\n&gt;&gt; One CO2.\n&gt;&gt; And then could I also take one to my\nseat post? This year, Continental came\nout with the DNA tall tire. Within it,\nthere are two different compound\nencasing options, creating four\ndifferent tires to choose from. the race\nrapid, race grip, and then you have the\nTrail Rapid, and Trail Grip. Bentonville\nis notorious for being hard on tires, so\nI'm going for the most durable option in\nthe Conti lineup. I'll be running the\nTrail Casing with the Grip Compound.\nTomorrow, the plan is race for the\nfront. If um stuff goes south, make the\nmost of it, put your head down, and keep\ngoing.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. The the hay is in the barn.\n&gt;&gt; Yes. Now, it's time to light it on fire.\nBig fire. Should be a lot of pain in\nthere.\n&gt;&gt; All right, folks. It is that time to\nbegin our call outs.\n&gt;&gt; I can't hear you. You guys are ready for\nthe mountain bike racing. All right,\nladies and gentlemen, we are within 30\nseconds of our start time here. Riders,\nare you ready? Please clear the shoot. 5\n4 3 2 1 We are officially underway. Make\nsome noise for our top riders. Round\nnumber five.\nIf I've heard anything,\nit's everybody's fake. No one knows what\nthey say. Just pick a side for\nyou.\nGo on and play me. I know in your eyes I\ncould never get it right.\nYou\nwill never lose.\nYou can never find.\nI won't forget, but I'll survive. Cuz\nthis is the last time I let your blank\nrear wheels\nback here.\nAre\n&gt;&gt; there CO2s in it?\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; No. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it.\n&gt;&gt; Do we have two? I'll take two.\n&gt;&gt; What are you guys doing?\n&gt;&gt; Oh, we're just hanging out.\n&gt;&gt; You want to go ride?\n&gt;&gt; Uh, Alex dropped out.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, cool.\n&gt;&gt; Bye, guys. Good luck, Ros.\nWatch out is loose\none time.\nI stepped outside\na message saying high a fire. Told you\nit's a bad time, but I can talk.\nI really want to talk to you.\nI feel\nlike you're a robot and I'm pretty sure\nthis room feels a bad time.\n&gt;&gt; You just have one flat.\n&gt;&gt; Four. How's the body?\n&gt;&gt; Just can't keep air in your tires.\nThank you.\n&gt;&gt; You good?\n&gt;&gt; On your left.\nDude,\n&gt;&gt; you're drilling.\n&gt;&gt; You landed in a pile of rocks.\n&gt;&gt; Oh my.\nSecond person that's right there. Is\nthere something?\n&gt;&gt; Oh, just a loose rock.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, well, it's bad. I don't want to\nleave.\n&gt;&gt; He's coming for you.\n&gt;&gt; He's right up there. Go get him.\n&gt;&gt; I'm with you. I never can tell. The way\nyou drag me along the way. Tell me, am I\ninsane? Is this where we belong? Is it\npleasure or pain? Now we're still\nhanging on, going out of my head. You\nlove but what you said has got me\nhanging on.\nI can't help but walk through your head\nand I'm going\nright without you. Is that so?\nI can't help but walk through your head.\nI'm bleeding and all I need is a sign.\nI'm out here and I've been waiting so\nlong.\nOh,\nyou got me hanging on.\nYou got me hanging. Maybe I'm out of\nluck. Or maybe all of this bad. I'm not\nsure why we broke up. It was the best\nthat I had to say. It's all for the\nbest. I think the fate is a lie. I know\nmy hair is a mess. And you're a little\nbit high. Should I give it a chance? Is\nit ever enough? No more running ahead.\nNo more [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it up. going out of my\nhead\nand what you said is going to be hanging\non\nyour mind. Take me out of my mind right\nwithout you. Is that so?\nI can't help but walk through your\nlanding.\nAll I need is a sign out here and I've\nbeen waiting so long\n&gt;&gt; there at the end.\n&gt;&gt; Big big screen\n&gt;&gt; for 69th place there.\n&gt;&gt; That one was for Keegan.\n&gt;&gt; Those two are one two in the series.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, really? So the more I beat him, the\nfurther it puts him back.\n&gt;&gt; Look at you.\n&gt;&gt; What a best friend Quinn.\n&gt;&gt; Just taking care of daddy.\n&gt;&gt; Who won\nit?\n&gt;&gt; He won,\n&gt;&gt; dude. He led that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out from the gun.\nBrandon was second. And then last\n&gt;&gt; Where was Matt?\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\nI kind of got buried in the start.\nJust the right side shot up the right. I\nwas on the left and went back. So, I was\nkind of buried and then just went like\ntrying to get one by one by one by one.\nUm, and yeah, on one of the climbs I\njust felt my rear tire getting soft. So,\nI had to stop and plug it, but I\nactually had two holes. Got going, but\nit never really sealed. So, I had to\nstop again, put some more plugs in,\nand then I got a third cut, put more\nplugs in that, and then it just wasn't\nholding. So, I had to stop, take all the\nplugs out, put a tube in.\n&gt;&gt; And that's when you saw me at technical\ndifficulty, and you were like, Paul\nJames,\n&gt;&gt; can you tell James rear wheel?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Not too much. Uh, before that got\nto the aid station, kind of thought\nabout just like calling it a day, but I\nwas actually having a lot of fun. So,\njust kept going.\n&gt;&gt; You didn't get a wheel though, right?\n&gt;&gt; No, cuz it was holding air. So,\n&gt;&gt; so you just finished on a tube for the\nrest of that day.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. And then I crashed as you saw.\n&gt;&gt; Got that.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. It kind of hurt actually. Oh,\nyeah.\n&gt;&gt; I still feel like probably within the\nGrand Prix wasn't a terrible day.\nProbably better than some of my other\nones.\n&gt;&gt; I think going into Big Sugar, you\nprobably still have a shot at top 10.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think so, too. So [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] luck, but\nnot all is lost.\n&gt;&gt; Finishing the season in Bentonville the\nlast few years has been just an awesome\nway to finish the season. It's neat to\nbe in a community that's so centered\naround cycling. You go out in the\nevenings, you see kids riding bikes\neverywhere. There's trails everywhere.\nLike you'll be riding one trail through\na neighborhood and you look over and\nthere's like more trails over there.\nLunch downtown.\nGot my Bentonville bucks to spend.\nThen we're going to cruise up to\nCampfire Lodge. We got a little couple's\nretreat going on up there this next few\ndays.\nGet down in the car. Give it all it\nopen. Let me see. Get down in the car.\nGive it all it open. Let me see.\nI [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up this day. We hustle.\n&gt;&gt; We're just checking out how the overall\nshaking out. It's pretty close between\nthe top four really. Like any of those\nguys I think could win. I'm sitting 15th\nnow. So moved back, but there's a lot of\nus\nthat are pretty close in points. Pull\nthe boats off the back here and then\nit's like 100 yards that go\n&gt;&gt; post Little Sugar. Today's objective,\nwe're rolling out of Campfire Lodge,\ngoing to hit the trails and find our way\nover to Airship Coffee Shop over in\nColer. Nice recovery day if you ask me.\n&gt;&gt; I don't know what to say. Feeling empty\ninside now that you've gone away. I can\npicture you and someone else's place and\nhe's got his hands running down your\nface. Is it in my head? Cuz I just can't\nlet my demons go. You just did it for\nthe dopamine. You didn't mean to leave\nme so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up. You can't put in\ndopamine. It couldn't be that I'm just\nnot enough. It's so hard to accept that\nyou're gone and that's it. You did it\nfor the me\nand it didn't mean anything at all.\nGuess we throw it away. I don't know who\nto blame. Leave it all in a day and just\nput out the blame. Told me time and\nagain, you don't believe in the past. It\nwas us\nlast\ntime.\n&gt;&gt; All right, recovery day in the books.\n&gt;&gt; Now it's time to hang out. Enjoy\nCampfire's finest facilities. Rest up.\nBig Sugar's coming soon."

      "transcript": "Welcome to Northwest Arkansas in the Big\nSugar Race weekend. We're here for the\nclosing rounds of the 2025 Lifetime\nGrand Prix. This area has become the de\nfacto place to go for all things\noff-road riding. You want gravel? We've\ngot gravel. You want mountain bike\ntrails? Well, we've got mountain bike\ntrails. Today we are going to focus on\nLittle Sugar Mountain Bike, the fifth\nstop of the 2025 Lifetime Grand Prix and\na technical course that will test the\nskills of every rider in the Grand Prix.\nHi, I'm Kayleen Griffith and I'm the CEO\nof Visit Bentonville. One of the things\nI think is special is that we have a lot\nof different experiences when you're\nhere. You have trails and the outdoor\nexperiences. You also have arts and you\nhave this wonderful culinary experience.\nI tell people we're the mountain bike\ncapital of the world and it's not\nbecause of the number of trails or the\nexperiences you're getting. It is the\nexperience that our city became this\ncycling destination.\n[Music]\nSo for a little sugar um a lot of the\nthe route 50k and the 100k goes up in\nBella Vista, Arkansas. So we like to be\nhere and kind of help people get\noriented, help them get to know Bella\nVista and welcome to Northwest Arkansas.\nBella Vista from a mountain biking\nperspective has just about everything\nthat you would want. It's got flow\ntrail, it's got technical. You come to\nBella Vista, no matter how you want to\ntrain, no matter how you want to ride,\nyou're going to find it here in Bella\nVista.\nBefore\nwe get into the race, let's take a look\nat the 100 km mountain bike course. The\nriders start from Coler Mountain Bike\nPark Preserve, a sanctuary for riders of\nall skill levels. We'll head north for a\n2 and 1/2 mile lead out before things\nreally begin with a steep grassy climb\nright into the single track that this\narea is so well known for. From the down\nunder loop will connect with tunnel\nvision for nearly 12 mi of up and down\nsingle track which will take us all the\nway up to technical difficulty. A\nsection of trail where the name says it\nall. Steep technical switchbacks that\nwill test the endurance and skill of\neach and every rider. From technical\ndifficulty, we bomb back down towards\ntown. and crossing over the Windsor Dam\nbefore hitting the one and only aid\nstation on the course at mile 30. Fueled\nup for the second half of the course,\nriders will now climb their way up\nthrough the back 40 toward the ledges, a\nnarrow and technical section of the\ncourse that sits high above the ravine\nbelow. Patience and technical riding\nskills are a must to make it through\nthis area. Now that the heart rates come\ndown a little bit and the ledges is\ncomplete, the beautiful Mighty Pine\nTrail awaits. The last section, of\ncourse, before riders can start to feel\nthe energy in downtown Bentonville,\nwhere the finish line will come alive.\nWho will take this year's top spot and\nclaim top step of the podium? Well,\nthere's only one way to find out. Now\nthat we've seen the course for the day,\nlet's take a look at our leaderboard.\nYou can see we have both scored points\nand total points, and there's a little\ndifference in numbers there. Well, keep\nin mind the Lifetime Grand Prix is\nscored across six races, but only five\ncount toward the final standings. That\nmeans after race number four at\nSchwamagan, each athletes lowest score\nof the season is dropped. Why? Well, not\nevery race goes according to plan. A\nflat tire, a bad day, missing an event.\nNone of those should define your entire\nseason. So dropping the lowest score\ngives a clearer look at who's truly\nperforming across the series. Coming\ninto Little Sugar Mountain Bike stop\nnumber five, things couldn't be tighter.\nOn the men's side, just a handful of\npoints are separating the top riders.\nYou can see that Keegan Swenson is still\nyour current leader with 82 scored\npoints. Simone Po, he's dropping his Sea\nOtter Classic score. That's got him in\nsecond at 78. Tied with Toby Road who\nalso drops his Sea Otter Classic. In\nfourth place is Brendan Johnston with 76\npoints after dropping his Leadville\nTrail 100 after he was a DNF.\nAnd Alexi Vermulan, who's also dropping\nhis Leadville Trail 100 score, is in\nfifth with 72 scored points. Taking a\nlook now at our women's standings and\nSophia Gomez V. Shafany and Cesaly\nDecker are tied on scored points with\n86. That includes Sophia's drop race of\nthe Leadville Trail 100 and Cesaly's\ndrop race of Schwamagan. Now, important\nto note Cesley not appearing on our\nstart list for today. So, that's going\nto be interesting to see how that\nfactors depending on how the race\nfinishes up today. In third, Melissa\nRollins with 82 points. In fourth,\nAlexis Scarta with 70. Cecile Ljuna\nrounding out the top five with 62\npoints. And those three riders\ndefinitely looking for a big day to\nagain try and capitalize on Cesaly\nDecker potentially not starting here.\n&gt;&gt; Three, two, one, we are officially\nunderway. makes the noise. Our top\nriders round number five six in 2025.\nRight time of Grand Prix lead 100\nkilometers.\nOur riders now making their way up that\nfirst section. Everybody knows it's a\nfight to the single track to get there\nfirst because there's so few\nopportunities to pass once they get into\nthe course proper. Matt Beers leading a\nlong line of our riders now as they make\ntheir way up this hill before dumping\ninto the single track for the day. We've\ngot our camera on Alexi Vermulan as he\nfollows a long line of riders. Alexi\nlooks like he's got himself positioned\njust about seventh or eighth position,\nbut look at this. Cam Jones already\npunching the clock and going to work and\nopening up a little bit of real estate\nover the rest of our riders.\nAt the front of the men's race with just\n6.6 miles covered and only four miles\ninto the single track, Cam Jones and\nBraden Lang have established a little\nbit of a gap off the front already. In\nthird is one of our wildcard riders,\nMatt Wilson out of New Zealand on the\nchase.\n&gt;&gt; In five, four, three, two, one.\n&gt;&gt; Now with our elite women as they get\nready to take the start for their 100\nkometer Lil Sugar race here today. Just\nlike the men, they'll be treated to a\nlittle bit of a roll out here. 2 and 1/2\nmiles of pavement before they dump into\nthe grass up that long climb that is\nsure to be a launching pad as riders\nfight for position. Looking now at the\ncamera on Deanna Males as she fights at\nthe front. You can see that's Sophia\nGomez, Visha Fany leading the charge as\nwe pan out a little bit and already some\nriders having a little bit of difficulty\nat the back as Sophia really drives the\npace. She was the winner here last year,\nso she knows how important it is to get\ninto this single track first.\n&gt;&gt; We've got a great vantage point now from\nMelisa Rollins as she follows Michaela\nThompson onto this tricky single track\nsection.\nThis looks like Crystal Anthony now over\nthe bridge. So Crystal in a good spot.\nShe's one of the locals here in\nBentonville, so has a lot of knowledge\nof our trails.\nLook at this. Sophia already getting\ndown to business. Looks like she's got a\nfair bit of daylight with Alexis Scarda\nnow coming through in second spot.\nAnd our chasers coming into sight. Samra\nShepard, Michaela Thompson, Ruth Hulcom,\nand Hannah Otto all rolling through.\nJust 6.6 miles into the women's race and\nalready Sophia Gomez, Vishafany has\nabout an 11second gap. Alexis Scarta is\non the chase right now with Michaela\nThompson and Ruth Hulkcom a further 20\nseconds behind with Samra Shepard and\nHannah Otto another 10 seconds back.\n&gt;&gt; We're back now with Melissa Rollins and\nit looks like she just passed Cecil Lun.\nSo, we understand that Melissa had a\nflat tire. She's now got it repaired and\ntrying to make her way back to the front\nend of the race.\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n&gt;&gt; Nice job, Sophia.\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n&gt;&gt; Looking again at Melisa Rollins and\nnothing but daylight in front of her.\nShe continues to push the pace.\nNow looking at our men's group with the\nAlexi Vermula cameras as they fight for\npositions getting back off a transition\ninto another single track section.\nLooking now at Matt Beers tagged onto\nthe back of our leading trio. Remember\nwe've got Braden Lang and Cam Jones\nwho've been driving this pace. These\nthree riders have uh pulled out a good\nbit of real estate over the rest of the\ngroup so far. Oh, Lexi Vermulan. You can\ntell from where he is back in the group\nthat he's obviously had a little bit of\na mishap trying to get his way around\nthe Canadian Mike Vandenham.\n&gt;&gt; Sorry, Lance.\n&gt;&gt; Here's a great rear mounted shot of Cam\nJones. You can see Braden Lang doing a\ngreat job to hang on right now. Matt\nBeer still in the picture. Cam Jones\ncontinuing to be the driver on this\ngroup. Braden Lang and Matt Beers\nappears to be kind of yo-yoing just a\nlittle bit on the back of the group all\nday so far.\nRogers taking the opportunity to stretch\njust a little bit, taking a little\nnutrition. The Cam Jones maybe just\nstarting to pull a little bit of real\nestate out as Matt Beers moving into\nsecond spot getting around Braden Lang\nright now.\nSo Matt Beers now back right glued to to\nCam Jones rear wheel and looking to see\nwhere Braden Lang is. I'll tell you, you\ncan see that Cam Jones really starting\nto pile on the pressure right now. Every\ntime we see him come around these turns,\nthere's just a little bit more daylight\nstarting to open up in there. So you\nhave to wonder if Cam is really making a\nbid to go solo. Here's the first look\nwe've gotten all day at our Chasing a\nGroup. We've got Canadian duo Shawn\nFinchman, Andrew Las followed by Brendan\nJohnson. Right around the 26 mile mark\ninto our event, 3 minutes is the gap to\nthe leaders.\nLet's go catch up with the women's race.\nHere comes Alexis Scarta still holding\nstrong in second spot out there on the\ncourse. Hannah Otto and Michaela\nThompson in third and fourth. Just about\nto link back up here on the chase.\nGo ahead.\n&gt;&gt; Melissa Rollins, remember she had\ndropped outside of the top 15. So now\nshe's got herself back up into fifth.\nSo, a phenomenal ride by her to get\nherself back to the front end of the\nrace.\nWell, now back with our leader. This is\nSophia Gomez Vafany. And remember, she\nwon here last year, so she knows these\ntrails very well. Remember, she fought\nso hard early to get that whole shot up\nthe hill. And she's making the most of\nit right now, dictating her pace, riding\nwell within herself as she continues to\nopen up that gap.\nGetting\nanother look at Alexis Scarta as well.\nAnd you can see just how challenging\nthis course is. You could just see her\nput her foot down in that corner back\nthere. Hannah Otto once again in great\nform today. Michaela Thompson, the\nyoungster out of Durango, having another\nphenomenal ride.\nWhat a great shot of some of the\nchallenges out here at Little Sugar\nMountain Bike. So easy to see why these\ntrails in Northwest Arkansas are some of\nthe best in the world, offering these\nriders a great challenge.\nWell, here's our first and only feed\nzone of the day. So, riders going to\nmake sure they take on all the nutrition\nthey can for the second half of the\nrace. Also, the only spot for neutral\nservice. So, if riders need a wheel or\nthey think they've got any kind of\nmechanical issue, this is the one spot\non the course where they're going to be\nable to service that with their crews.\n&gt;&gt; I had a front flat.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Do you think I should switch the wheel?\n&gt;&gt; I have no idea.\n&gt;&gt; How long ago? How long ago was it?\n&gt;&gt; A uh maybe 10 miles ago.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I just ride it. It looks good.\nNow, let's check back in on the front\nend of the men's race.\n&gt;&gt; Cam Jones out of New Zealand, who's been\none of the revelations of the 2025, a\nlifetime at Grand Prix, and he has\nreally burst onto the scene this year.\nBraden Lang still holding solid in that\nsecond position out there. Our chasers,\nthis is Finchum and Lebron. And I'll\ntell you what, Matt Beers not in the\npicture. So, we're not sure what\nhappened to Matt Beers. And also looks\nlike Brendan Johnson has lost contact\nwith that chasing group as well. So, a\nlot of things starting to really shuffle\naround here as we get deeper into the\nLooks like Shawn Fincham was dropped\nfrom the chase group. Meanwhile, Matt\nBeers got his flat fixed and is now\nmaking his way back up into the\nstandings.\nComing up on the final checkpoint for\nthe men's race, the 50.8 8 mile marker.\nAnd of course, that's the infamous\nEddie's RV section of the course. Cam\nJones still driving the train on the\nfront. Braden Lang now over a minute\nbehind with Andrew Laspon almost 4 and a\nhalf minutes down in third.\nComing through. Coming through. Coming\nthrough.\nWell, now we're looking at downtown\nBentonville as we await the finish of\nour men's race. And just like that, Cam\nJones is picking up his second win of\nthe 2025 Lifetime Grand Prix here at\nLittle Sugar. Coming across the line in\nsecond, Braden Lang going to hang on for\none of his best finishes in the Grand\nPrix.\nAnother rider with a career-defining\nperformance here today, the Canadian\nAndrew Lebron hanging on for third.\nWell, now that our men are all wrapped,\nwe're back with our women's race and\nAlexis Scarta still trying to chase it\ndown. Our lone leader on the front just\nbehind her, it looks like we've got\nHannah Otto still holding on to third.\nMichaela Thompson in fourth spot. That's\nSam Shepard coming through along with\nRuth Hulcom and Meisa Rollins. Look at\nthat. Meisa Rollins, we know she flatted\nearlier. It appears maybe she had a\nsecond mishap as she's once again\nfinding herself on the back foot here.\nWell, Sophia Gomez Visha still in a\ncomfortable lead right now as she\ntackles the ledges. This is that\ntwo-mile section that starts out right\naround mile 41. You can see how narrow\nand challenging it is. Riders really\nhaving to dial back the pace a little\nbit to make sure they get through this\nsmooth. And well, you don't want to make\na right-hand turn anywhere on this\nOh,\ncan I come? I Oh my god. Sorry.\nYou Hey.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Good. Good. Keep going. Yes.\n&gt;&gt; You got this, Samara. That big gap to\nthe next girl.\n&gt;&gt; The Eddie's RV section. Sophia Gomez,\nVisha still in command at the front of\nthe race now with a 2inut and 20 second\ngap over Alexis Scarta. Hannah Otto\ncurrently into third place, almost 4\nminutes behind Alexis in second. And\nthen Michaela Thompson and Melisa\nRollins in fourth and fifth, a further\nminute and change behind Hannah.\nWell, Misa Rollins continuing to push\nthe pedals, driving forward now making\nthe pass of Hannah Otto. Amazing. She's\nnow moving into third spot. Very late as\nwe close in on the finish.\nSo, now things have reshuffled just a\nlittle bit. Sophia Gomez, Visha still on\nthe front. Alexa Scarta still in second,\nbut Melisa Rollins has now moved into\nthird place on the chase. Hannah Otto\nnow back in fourth.\nWell, now we're down at the finish. We\nknow Sophia Gomez, Visha, is probably\ngoing to take this one home. And there\nshe is, crossing the line to win for the\nsecond year in a row here at Little\nSugar. Alexis Scarta hanging on for a\nbrilliant ride to secure second place on\nthe day. And it's high fives all around\nfor one of her best rides of the season.\nAnd look at this. Meisa Rollins has hung\non for third place. What a comeback\nstory here today for this rider with\nthat untimely flat.\nGentlemen, hands in the air. This is\nyour overall podium, which also serves\nas your lifetime Grand Prix podium for\nthe day.\n[Applause]\n&gt;&gt; We've also got a custom winners jersey\ncourtesy of Pond Studios for Mr. Jones.\nLadies and gentlemen, your overall\nwomen's podium.\n&gt;&gt; This also stands as our lifetime Grand\nPrix podium for the day. With that, we\nhave a winners jersey to present\ncourtesy of Pormal Studios.\nWhat a great day of racing here in\nNorthwest Arkansas as we are wrapping up\nthe Little Sugar Mountain Bike. And what\na day in the overall standings. Some\nriders on top of the leaderboard not\nreally having the day they wanted while\nsome other riders producing career best\nperformances. Keegan Swenson still sits\non top of the leaderboard with 98 scored\npoints. But look at this. We now have a\ntie for second place. Cam Jones on the\nstrength of his win here today. He moves\nup from sixth place now into a tie with\nSimone Po for second. Toby RH in fourth\nplace. Alexi Vermullen still holding\nstrong rounding out our top five. Taking\na look now at our women's overall\nstandings at the end of the day. And\nremember, we started the day with Sophia\nGomez, Avisha Fier, and Cesley Decker\ntied on points. Well, Cesley's non-start\ntoday combined with Sophia's commanding\nwin now has Sophia in sole ownership of\nthe lead with 116 points. Decker still\nholding on to second, six points down.\nthat Melissa Rollins is in third place\nwith 108. Alexis Scarta still in fourth\nwith 98 points. Rounding out our top\nfive with 79 points. Cecil Leune. What a\ngreat start to the final week of the\n2025 Lifetime Grand Prix here in\nNorthwest Arkansas. Lil Sugar Mountain\nBike delivered on every single level. We\nhad great racing. We had worthy winners.\nWe had some great battles amongst our\nleaderboard. And we are set for a great\nfinal race next weekend with a big sugar\ngravel.

      "transcript": "Well, Schwamaging went better than I\nthought it would. We are officially\nnearing the end of the Lifetime Grand\nPrix. Headed into Little Sugar, the most\ntechnical race on the calendar. Little\nSugar is a race I've been scared of\nsince we started in April. It is the\nmost technical race on the calendar.\nIt's the first year it's been included\nin the Lifetime Grand Prix, and it is a\nvery technical cross country endurance\nrace.\nI would say for me, it is more of a\nmental test than physical. Currently\nsitting in fourth overall and I just\nwant to get through it feeling like I\nmoved forward, not backward. Get ready\nfor two weeks of backto-back racing in\nBentonville. Starting with Little Sugar,\nending with Big Sugar, where the rocks\nare tougher than my competition.\n[Music]\nOh yeah. Happy to be back. Happy to be\nback. The fifth time of the year we've\ndone this. Fifth time. Fifth Grand Prix\nrace. We are in Benville, Arkansas. We\nare at Oz Trails. Uh we are in the\nlegendary mountain bike capital of the\nworld. Yeah. This is the first year of\nbackto-back racing weekends. Little\nsugar, big sugar inside the Grand Prix.\nUm I'm pretty stoked. It was definitely\na a hurdle to get around mentally\nthough, just planning. It takes a lot of\nplanning to execute races like this. The\namount of time we stay and getting all\nthe bikes and equipment and tires all to\nthe one place and be prepared. Um but\nyeah, once we land on the ground, it's\nkind of nice to be in one place for the\nlast two events. First couple days, last\ncouple days have been pretty relaxed. Um\nthat was kind of the goal is to get in\nand keep the days moving but uh simple\nand hopefully going into the race um you\nknow not feeling too much pressure. I\nthink what's interesting is Little Sugar\nand Big Sugar are drastically different\nraces. Uh but they on on the ranking\nboard they're the exact same the exact\nsame amount of points available for to\ngrab. Little Sugar is the only proper\nmountain bike race in the Grand Prix. Um\nit's 60 really hard miles. Um, and\ninsanely technical. You won't see\nanybody out here on drop bars or funny\nbikes. Uh, it is a proper race.\n&gt;&gt; Almost died.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. From the beginning of the year,\nI've looked at Little Sugar as kind of\nthis big dark cloud hanging over the\nGrand Prix for me. Um, but honestly,\ntoday was the first time I got out on\ncourse and was feeling like everything\nwas ticking and we're going the right\ndirection. Um, and I'm kind of excited\nto see what I can what I can do. Um, but\nthat does not mean there are not a lot\nof nerves.\nOn paper, Little Sugar is not made for\nme at all. Uh, I've tried to get in a\nheadsp space where I'm mentally and\nphysically ready and then kind of let\nthe day give what it gives. Yeah, the\ncourse is just something that for me is\nnot easy to ride. Um, I struggle to find\nthat balance between riding at my\nphysical limit and my technical limit.\nThey're very different. And so I go into\nLittle Sugar thinking, \"Okay, I can ride\nthis hard because that's my technical\nability.\" And I need to focus on how to\nnot flat, not crash, and make it through\nthe event as opposed to\ntrying my best into every corner. Um, I\nhave to look at as a as a full course\nand not just split it up into all these\nlittle sections.\n&gt;&gt; Biggest prep I've done is about just\ndoing some skills with Bridge Drew. Um,\nchecking out kind of the the two big\ncruxes of the course. My goal is not to\nbe a good mountain biker, honestly, in\nthe next couple days. My goal is to just\nfind a couple moves and make me feel\nmore confident on the trails. Did that\nyesterday. We rode uh one of the two uh\nblack trails and I'm going to go ride\nthe second very well-known ledges so\nthat I don't fall off and die.\nThe ledges specifically is really about\nbelief was what it became for me. Um, a\nlot of times in mountain biking, I\ndidn't grow up looking at big rock piles\nand you come into them and the reality\nis the only way up, the only way through\nis up and over.\n&gt;&gt; Good.\nGood.\nGood. Stay high.\n&gt;&gt; Move your body.\n&gt;&gt; Get out of the saddle.\n&gt;&gt; Let the bike come up into you. Get out\nof the saddle. Let the bike come up into\nyou. If you move your body up over\nthose,\n&gt;&gt; they'll minimize how much they're\nslowing you down and then you're not\nworried about it. So you're not trying\nto pedal through it as much.\n&gt;&gt; Look at this guy.\n&gt;&gt; I think the the small little technical\nsections are pretty mental. I don't\nthink they make a massive decision in\nthe whole race, but it's that feeling of\nprogress forward. Uh not stopping, kind\nof pulling your bike over is always\ngreat. And just it feels good to ride\nthe whole course as opposed to kind of\nknowing there sections that are going to\nstop you up.\n&gt;&gt; Good. Heels. Heels. Heels.\nI say this with uh love and respect for\nmy grand precompatriots, but uh I\nwouldn't say anybody thinks that I'm a\ngood mountain biker.\n&gt;&gt; Well, he already knows. Use his brakes\nless. We told We've been over this,\ndude. That was the first thing I told\nhim when when we rode together at\nWhiskey 50 pre- riding. He's like, \"What\nare your tips?\" Might count to three\nbefore you use your brakes cuz you use\nthem too much.\n&gt;&gt; I think Matt Beers and Keegan are the\nguys to watch um very quickly behind\nthem. I think you can't ever count out\nCole and Braden. They're spectacular\nmountain bikers. I mean, riding behind\nBraden today was overwhelming.\nThere was a moment that I was riding\nbehind Braden and we were in this small\nsection and I am like focusing as well\nas I can stay on the wheel, pay\nattention, and he's drinking one hand on\nthe bars. It It's demoralizing.\nOkay, guys. Day before the race. It is\nalways supposed to be simple. It's never\nsimple. We're rushed the whole day. Uh\nI'm going to go do some packet pickup.\nI'm going to pre-ride the last little\nbit. Ire's going to go to the media\nmeeting and then interview Cole. Okay,\nhere goes two hours. Who did it hazy?\nBentonville's on fire. Coler was hopping\nwith all the people getting ready for\nLittle Sugar. Rolled down to pick up\npackets. Met up with Rich in the ride\nseries to do a little more skills and\nkind of chat with some friends. And of\ncourse, Willie had to see his fans. I\nwould say this is the first official\nmountain bike race in Grand Prix\nhistory, which I'm stoked for. Yeah.\nYeah. I came from mountain bike cross\ncountry racing and so like a lot of the\nmountain bike races that we've had in\nthe Grand Prix, they're really I would\nsay mellow. Um but this race it's\nproper. Like you really have to have\nyour skills on point and your equipment\non point. There's lots of tight\nswitchbacks, a ton of loose rock and you\nhave to be able to read the trail and\nanticipate what's coming. the clearer\nthe trail is in front of you, the the\nbetter you can ride your own pace. Um,\nbut then where you can really lose it is\njust puncturing. Like there's so many\nsharp rocks out there and if you\npuncture and which is inevitable out\nhere um that could really hurt you. I I\nI mean half of the Grand Prix field\ncomes from a like dedicated XCO\nbackground which is pretty sweet. So\nit's kind of like all the big culprits.\nUm, but yeah, the thing about this one\nis anything could happen and anyone\ncould puncture. Every Grand Prix race is\nhard, but this is just a different\ndemand on the body and mind. Yeah, I\nknow. I'm I'm stoked. We're not putting\ntogether sketchy mountain bike setups.\nIt's It's a real mountain bike race and\nand I'm here for it. This course is\nabout efficiency. This race is lost in\nevery corner. 10 watts in every single\ncorner.\nYou're say that's like thousands of\ncorners. you know,\n&gt;&gt; support this week has been a little\nelevated, which is awesome. Um, Derek's\nstill wrenching. Uh, but he's kind of\nbeen here helping out with tire\npressure, pre-ride stuff, kind of the\nwhole shebang. Chris is here kind of\ndoing everything in between. Uh, he's\nhelping film with Avery. He's helping\ndrive.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Uh, he ran out and got dinner tonight\nwhen I kind of had forgotten to go get\npasta. Always been impressed by what\nAvery and I can do alone, but she add\none person to that and it, you know,\nbecomes pretty clear that it becomes a\nfully functioning team. Uh, and having\nthat for the next two weeks is\ndefinitely going to be a big help. Yeah,\nI think we're going a little sugar with\nkind of all to play for in the top 10 of\nthe Grand Prix still. Uh, there's going\nto be a lot of shaking happening the\nnext two weekends. Um, even Keegan\ntheoretically doesn't have it locked up,\nalthough I would say he pretty much\ndoes. Uh, this race plays to his\nstrengths. Plan to me is just find a\nbalance. You know, I want to go in to\nthe first single track fighting for\nposition, but not too far up that I'm in\nfront of a lot of guys that can go\nfaster than me the whole day. The last\nthird of the race is where I'm going to\nmake up the most time I possibly can. To\nme, it's not a question of Grand Prix\npoints in any way, shape, or form. It is\nreally a fight on the day on Sunday at\nLittle Sugar because on paper, I don't\nfinish in the top 10. I think a lot of\nthe guys that I'm looking at making\nmoves are guys like Cam Jones, uh, who's\nright behind me. Treky's right in front\nof me. Guys that, um, look like they're\noutside the race. Um, can easily make a\njump. Feel like there's a tension in the\nair. I think everyone is focused on\ntrying to be the best version of\nthemselves tomorrow. Um, that'll\nprobably break. we all hang out next\nweek and see each other everywhere in\ntown. Um, there's a lot of guys I\nhaven't seen, whether they're hiding or\njust focusing on what they got to do.\nUh, I feel like it's all going to snap\ntomorrow 8 a.m. And from there, we kick\noff the finale.\nMorning started pretty simply. Um, ate a\nlot of oatmeal. Uh, no French toast\nsticks. just couldn't make it happen. I\nwasn't wasn't very hungry. Hydrated, did\nsome activation, hung out with Willie.\nUm it was a weird morning cuz Avery left\nwith the crew early to go get to the\nstart. Uh so I was kind of alone for the\nlast 45 minutes and then just had a nice\nlittle ride down to the start down to\nColer.\n&gt;&gt; Happy to have all of you joining us here\nfor the third annual little sugar\nmountain bike.\n&gt;&gt; Our first call is currently fifth\noverall in the Lifetime Grand Prix.\nPlease welcome Karen Jones to the line.\nAlexi Verullen.\n&gt;&gt; A dream miracle day is top five.\nLiterally everything would have to go\nright for that to happen. And I think\ntwo, three guys that I think would be up\nthere would have to have a mechanical.\nI think a top 10 is very attainable, but\nagain, I have to execute flawlessly for\nmyself. And then right around that top\n15 is where I think I put myself as a\nmountain biker. And again, that comes\ndown to just kind of being in a weird\nplace because that's kind of where I'm\nat with my drop race. So, one point up,\none point down can make a big\ndifference. Um, outside the top 15 will\nbe hard to swallow.\n&gt;&gt; Three, two, one, we are officially\nunderway. Make some noise. Our top\nrider, right time, the Grand Prix, our\nleap in 100 km.\n&gt;&gt; The start is very giddy up and wait.\nKind of jump off the line and everyone\ngets behind the motorbike in the car for\ntwo, three minutes. Eventually they pull\noff and it's guns ablazing.\nUm the next two three minutes is the\nhardest part of the whole race. We\nfollowing Keegan and Tobin on the side\ngoing into the grass. We got swarmed um\nand kind of found myself pretty far back\nas we got close to the entrance of the\nsingle track. Probably entered in top 25\nor so. I think it's kind of not what\npeople expect is it's such a dog fight\nfor that pinch point and then from there\nit's almost full stop into all the\ncorners as things kind of bungee out and\nforth over and over\npretty quickly. Uh front group went\naway. Uh, you watched Matt Beers and\nBraden and Cam ride away. Um, and I was\nkind of focused on the wheels ahead of\nme. Got through pretty simply. I was\npretty pretty happy. As we got into\nprobably 15 20 mi into the race, things\nstart to separate a little bit. Uh, we\nprobably had groups of five to seven.\nUm, and you'd have things slow and\ngroups come back together and they'd\nseparate again. Um, majority of this\nrace is all single track and so there\nreally isn't places to pass unless\nsomeone lets you. Um, you could force it\nin a couple places, but it's tough.\n&gt;&gt; Around mile 25, started realizing I was\nnursing a flat. Um, I had come into a\nbig compression and bottom out my\nsuspension. Um, had a little pinch flat,\nsomewhat perfect timing. Uh, rolled into\nthe aid station 5 miles later.\n&gt;&gt; Rear wheel.\nUh, it's always a little bit chaotic in\nthose moments because you have a big\nplan on what's going to happen. Um,\nthey're going to come in. I'm going to\nhave this bottle from Derek and Avery's\ngoing to film and I'm going to grab my\nfeed bag from Chris. And all of a\nsudden, uh, everything's kind of thrown\non his head. Dererick's changing the\nwheel. I'm kind of trying to take all my\nstuff out of the bag from Chris. Chris\nis trying to hold the bike. And the\nbiggest worry is that you're going to\nforget something. Leave something. The\nextra gel, the bottle, the ice sock, um,\nor you're not going to tighten the\nthrough axle. It's just there's so much\ngoing on. Um, so it felt good to get\nthrough that, have air in my tire again,\nand focus on the task ahead.\n&gt;&gt; 50 seconds to Keegan Cole.\nPretty sure everyone in the top 20 of\nthis race has flatted so far. So, it's\npretty much a competition of who can\nkeep sealant in their tires. And so far\nin the tire ceiling competition, I\nbelieve Cam Jones is leading that\ncategory with Braden Lang about 30\nseconds back, but they're charging. It's\na good day out there.\n[Applause]\nFrom there, it was burn the engine hot\nall the way to the finish. Um,\ndefinitely started making some mistakes\ntoward the end. I kind of knew going in\nthe positions would be constantly\nchanging all day. Um, you'd have big\nchanges, people flatting, crashing, um,\nrandom mechanicals happening.\n&gt;&gt; Another flat.\nNice.\n&gt;&gt; Once again, my whole focus was just\ntrying not to lose positions and\nfocusing on being consistent. Um, and\nhopefully just having kind of a\nnutrition rate happened throughout the\nday that allowed me to move forward.\n&gt;&gt; How far is he?\n&gt;&gt; 40 seconds.\nYeah, I mean the finale I was uh trying\nto chase Pac down. Um kind of crazy\nwhere I felt like I was gaining on him\nat certain times and I'd kind of make\nmistakes and get it get in my head. This\nrace is never over till it's over. So I\nwas trying to just kind of put that in\nmy head and use it as a mantra and keep\nmoving. Um but at some point I realized\nI might not see pacing again. Honestly\ncame out of the race really stoked. Um,\nwasn't my dream scenario, but it was a\nvery successful day.\n&gt;&gt; I think I finished 16th overall, eighth\nor ninth in the Grand Prix. Going into\nthis race, I said that I wanted to be\ntop 10. Um, and that was the goal. Uh\nmainly because 11th and 10th are my drop\nraces from Mudville and Unbound and so I\nwanted to be above that. Um and feel\nlike I progressed forward uh in a race\nthat's not made for me. Um and I would\nargue many would count me out. I\nexpected there to be a bit of that that\njust comes from people having bad luck\ndays. There was moments today where\nthere was guys I thought I'd never see\nagain. Pac was had a mechanical super\nearly and then fought back through the\nledges and finished two or three places\nup from me. Um, Truckucky was in the\nfront group fighting for a top three\npodium and didn't finish the race. Uh,\nand those things are\nreally, really, really affect the Grand\nPrix overall. Um, Brendan already had\nhis drop race at Lead Bill and so that\nputs him really far out of contention\ngoing into Big Sugar on on Saturday. Um,\nand then someone like Cam who is sitting\nin fifth behind me winning the race, it\nreally makes it uh interesting because\nnow he has a chance to fight for top\nthree pretty simply and it's kind of\nimpossible for me to catch him. So, um,\noverall I'm sitting here pretty happy.\nUm, it's a weird feeling though. I don't\nfeel like I physically gave my all.\nThere's parts of me like my arms, my\nhands, um, are tired. U, but I'm not\nlike physically exhausted. Um, because\nthere's just there's a lot of that\ncourse that I can't go all out. I have\nto hold back a little bit. It's really\nweird feeling, but I'm I'm at peace.\nIt's definitely a race that I've been\nworried about since we started this in\nApril. Um, and I think even just parts\nof me that didn't even want to be\nvulnerable last night to the camera,\nlike I really wanted to just at least\nbeat the roadies, right? I wanted to\nbeat Simon. I wanted to beat Toby and\nthey were both ahead of me in the Grand\nPrix. And I think I found some solace as\nthat happened on course where I just\nlike focused on my race. Um and didn't\nallow, you know, Simon flying through\nthe field at one point to change my\ngoals. Um yeah, and now we get to turn\ninto a different type of pressure next\nSaturday cuz Big Sugar having won last\nyear is going to be a big difference.\nAnd um yeah, the roads are are carnage\nout there. It's easy to easy to see the\nGrand Prix go away again. So, um,\npretty cool to see the progression I\nmade on a mountain bike and looking\nforward to kind of what I have next\nweekend.\nNext up, Big Sugar. Uh, we got a week in\nBentonville in between. Uh,\na little bit of training, keeping the\nengine running, but uh, a lot of it is\ngoing to be recovery. Um, getting ready\nfor a very different type of race. Um,\nback in the gravel bag, back on the MOG.\nUm, but still trying to find the right\ntires and the right tire pressures. So\nstay tuned. Um,\nmaybe a video in between. Every trying.\nWe'll see how it goes. Thanks for\nwatching."
