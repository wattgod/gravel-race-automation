      "transcript": "This is a 1994 Gary Fisher Tasahara\noriginal mountain bike with the 3x7\ndrivetrain. Mountain bike trail tires\nand 26-in wheels and cantalver brakes.\nIn the last video, I restored this bike\nas close as I could to preserve the\noriginal ride feel. This is a 2024 Niner\nRLT9 gravel bike. It has a GRX 610 1x12\ndrivetrain, hydraulic disc brakes, 40mm\ngravel tires on 700c wheels. Both bikes\nare equipped with Garmin Rally power\nmeter pedals.\n[Music]\nThe cost, the Gary Fisher was free to\nme, but market value of the bike for\nrestoration is close to $150 or so. I\nput $70 in for tubes and tires, $20 in\nfor new brake pads, $60 for the grips\nand saddle, $10 for new cables and\nhousing. Putting this bike at a total\nestimated cost of around $310.\nI built up this Niner RLT9 from the\nframe up last year for $1,500. Although\nthis is five times the cost of the Gary\nFisher, it is still a screaming deal for\nwhat you get. Today, Niner sells this\ncomplete bike marked down from $2,900 to\n$1,900\nwith only an 11-speed CRAM rival build.\nThe route\nThe route consists of a road ascent up\nto the trails from Fruit Veil through\nButters Canyon. Half mile or so,\naveraging 10% grade, and the other 3 and\n1/2 miles a meal 4 to 5% grade. A pretty\nsolid climb though. It'll definitely\nwarm up the legs.\nAfter that, there's a chunky fire road\nclimb of two miles at 5% along Dun and\nGraham trails before a swoopy and\nsometimes chunky dirt descent back to\nthe ridge road along the West Ridge\nTrail.\nNext, there's a curvy road section that\nmoderately ascends back to the dirt\ntrails along Skyline Boulevard. I then\ndip back into the dirt and cross walking\nMiller Park on the Sequoia Bay View\nTrail before bombing downhill back to\nFruit Bale on the road.\nThe route in total is around 15 mi and\n700 ft in elevation up and back down.\nSo, here's the challenge. Which one of\nthese bikes is the better ride? Gary\nFischer felt pretty slow on the road\nclimb. I thought I would be wasting a\nbunch of watts trying to pedal fast\nuphill, but the reality is that I just\nwasn't able to put any power down. The\ntriple chain ring and six-speed cassette\nin the rear made it hard to match my\ncadence smoothly. And instead, I opted\nto stick in the smallest chain ring and\ngo up and down the six-speed cassette as\nneeded.\ntires may have had a bit more rolling\nresistance than the gravel bike as well.\nConversely, the gravel bike felt fast.\nIt encouraged me to pedal hard and I had\nthe confidence that when I shifted, I\nwas going to be able to match my cadence\nwithout lagging too much.\nThe real time gap opened up when the\ngrade mellowed out and the road became a\nbit more twisty. The gravel bike gained\na 3minute edge largely due to its\nsnappier handling and ability to build\nspeed through an efficient drivetrain.\nOn the Gary Fisher, I found myself\ntrying to bounce between the smallest\nand middle chain ring while going up and\ndown the rear cassette. After I dropped\na chain, trying to find the perfect\ngearing, I decided it was easier to just\ngo slow and steady.\nOnce I got to the dirt, the performance\nbetween the two bikes evened out over\nthe rougher and steeper climbs on the\ntrail. The bikes performed evenly. Uh\nthere was a lot less shifting needed and\nthey both handled pretty nicely. On the\nGary Fisher, I spun out on a wet route,\nand on the gravel bike, I lost traction\non a dusty rock.\nThe off-road descent saw the Gary Fisher\nclaw back a minute on the grapple bike,\nbut it did so at a cost. The rigid steel\nfork was bone shaking. The canal lever\nbrakes took at least two fingers to\npull. Even then, weren't the most\neffective. I'd say I spent a quarter of\nthe time descending, feeling out of\ncontrol. But it sure was fast, just\nmaybe not the safest. Luckily, there\nweren't too many hikers around. In the\nbeginning of the descent, I was having a\nlot of fun, but by the end of it, I was\nhappy it was over. My hands were going\nnumb and feeling pretty fatigued from\nthe ride quality.\nThe gravel bike, while slower, gave me a\nbetter sense of control, and the 700c\nwheels rolled over the chunk easier. I\nwas able to enjoy the out of control\nmoments a bit better, knowing I could\nactually stop on that connecting road\nsection. back to Walking Miller Park,\nthe Gary Fisher lagged behind the gravel\nbike by almost a minute. No surprise\nhere, though.\nOnce in Walking Miller Park on the Bay\nView Trail, uh the Gary Fisher and the\ngravel bike completed the section the\nsame amount of time. The real headline\nhere, though, is ride feel. Due to the\nlack of stopping power and fatigue on my\nhands and arms from the rocks and roots,\nI was a bit out of control. At one\npoint, my hands slipped off the bars\ncompletely. I managed to stay upright\nand regain control before almost\ncrashing at the feet of a hiker. She was\nnot impressed.\nOnce back on the road, I flew down the\nmountain back home.\nOn paper, it looks like the Gary Fisher\nand the gravel bike were almost a draw.\nThe Gary Fisher used less watts overall\nand was faster on the downhill dirt\nsections, and the gravel bike performed\nbetter on road climbs. Both tied on the\nMelor Bay View Trail. I won't compare\nfinal times as this is probably due more\nto route creation and having more road\nmiles than dirt. Off paper, I'm going to\nhave to give the overwhelming victory to\nthe gravel bike. It was just a much more\nenjoyable ride. The drivetrain made it\neasy to find the right gear for my legs\nto keep pushing. The brakes were easy to\noperate and actually stopped me when I\nneeded them to. The most important\nthing, though, was the ride feel. The\nGary Fisher was incredibly fatiguing to\nride. I was exhausted despite all the\nnumbers saying it was a much easier\neffort.\nSo, can a '90s mountain bike be a gravel\nbike? Absolutely. Can it be better than\nan actual gravel bike? No. Does it have\nto be, though? For 1/5 the price, I was\nable to get out on the road and trails\nand have a great time. These are still\ngreat entry-level bikes for anyone\nlooking to start riding without spending\nall of their money. Just don't ride them\nso hard that you want to give up the\nsport entirely.\nStill not convinced? In the next video,\nwe'll see if we can make some component\nchanges to address the ride feel and\nlimit the fatigue. Thanks for watching.\nI'll see you next time."

it's about\nyou know going and participating is a\ncelebration of being healthy being fit\num\nand yeah being a part of like the\nmovement you know people being\nout there testing themselves you know\nsome were road racers their first time i\nwrote with this kid who was 19. he was\npitting for his dad in 2015 when we did\nthe record\ntotally like highlight of his day was\nriding with me for the last like hour\nthen he fled and i was like well\ndang i guess\nhe's not going to make his goal to\nfinish in seven hours i turned over and\nthen he was like fumbling with his co2s\nand i'm just going to stop like what's\nthe difference between 32nd and 35th\nplace whatever\num so i helped him fix his tire plugged\nhis tire he was like thank you thank you\nand he had blood all over his knuckles\nhe had crashed earlier in the day and so\nwhile i didn't make my goal i helped him\nmake his\nand i think that\nwas really pretty cool because it gave\npurpose to my race but i was having a\nbad day honestly i was uh hitting that\nceiling\nso pretty much right from the first\nclimb i knew i was going to be in\ntrouble i just didn't have it you know i\nmean and there's nothing you can do you\ncan't fake it you can't push harder you\ncan't try harder\nbecause i did all those things you know\nthere's some times when i'm like this\nrace is stupid i hate this race it's a\nout and back dirt road and it's\ngravel and sand and there's so many\nthings about it that\nkind of bother me but in the end of the\nday also it's not about having fun you\nknow leadville is about testing yourself\nleadville about toughness perseverance\novercoming and i think that when i look\nat the\nthe race today you know i'm proud of\nfinishing\nyou"

because it's 30\ndegrees really really hot for our Dutch\nstandards really cool thing is that the\nkids Sam and Mick are also racing The\nStrider race\nand they're arriving later Daisy's gonna\nbring them so I had to take the vet\nI raised this race back in 2017 that was\nmy first year racing on the road\nand the race was at the end of the year\nand I won it\nso I'm super excited and really looking\nfor some Revenge again today Masters are\nracing right now one thing that changed\nis they put the finish on a different\nspot this used to be the before last\nCorner going into a zigzag section over\nthere but now we've got the finish here\non a very long straight so different\nfinishing tactics\nI lived in in barn for over 25 years and\nmy parents used to live exactly in the\nmiddle of this Loop of the Criterion but\nthey moved six weeks ago so they're not\nhere anymore preparing from the car\ntoday\nI'm definitely not acclimatized to the\nheat but I guess nobody is today because\n30 degrees is quite unusual in the\nNetherlands I'm wearing a white jersey\nand I'm gonna bring a bottle of water\nthat I can just throw over me before the\nstart and that's about as much as I can\ndo it number 23.\nbut from that point on he's been on my\nlist again I also cut my hair yesterday\nto shed a bit of the insulation raises\n60 kilometers so I think it's going to\nbe an hour and a half or less speeds are\nusually pretty high here previous time I\nraced this race was in 2019 and I had a\nmassive jet lag I got back from San\nFrancisco the day before I cracked\nduring the race I just did not have the\nenergy but this year I can't make that\nexcuse I flew to Oslo and back yesterday\nso no jet lag except for the kids\nkeeping us awake all night but there's\nalways an excuse\nthat's the start of the race let's have\na look how this is going to play out we\nhave a Peloton of about 35 Riders so not\nthat big we've got amateur categories or\nno Elite Riders different from the last\ncouple times I entered this race but the\ntime I won this race a few years ago it\nwas also amateurs but the difference was\nthat I was racing in a theme I had a\nquite a lot of team members who were all\nriding for me that day they know it was\nmy local race and they you know\nthey were happy to help me out on that\nrace and I managed to win it today it's\nvery different because I'm by myself\nthis whole year I'm not racing with a\nteam so it's just me wearing my Sirocco\nJersey and that's it so when you race by\nyourself the strategy is kind of\ndifferent than when you're riding with\nthe whole team we're on this lap this is\nthe most probably the most difficult\npart of the lap because it went uphill\nnow it goes downhill and this whole road\nis quite bumpy going into this very\nsharp corner here the sharpest corner of\nthe lap then more bumpy Brick Road and\nthen another ride turn on to the\nfinishing straight now the lap has\nchanged since the last time I raced this\nrace this used to be the backside of the\ncourse and then in between those sharp\nCorners was the Finish now this is the\nfinishing street so a very wide long\nstraight road so tactics we're going to\nbe very different for two reasons first\nof all I'm buying my self second finish\nis very different there's a couple teams\none guy in front of me in the panther\nJersey they have a few Riders on their\nteam today so I was kind of looking at\nthem I figured if there's one of these\nguys going out for a breakaway and the\nrest stays in the Peloton then they're\ngonna help each other they're gonna you\nknow slow down the pack and it would be\na very high chance of success if I would\nbe in a breakaway with one of these guys\nthere's one guy already up the road\nwhich is their team captain and last\nyear's National Champion from Fisher I\nknow he's a very strong Rider I think he\nhe's not as fit as last year but he was\nup the road from the gun I don't know\nexactly why but he's riding in front of\nthe Peloton I figured if if it's just\nhim\njust let him go for a couple laps we'll\nsee what happens I stay in the front of\nthe Peloton to see what's going on\nthat's very important if you're on the\nway in the back you can't see what\nwhat's going on and sometimes I have to\nmove up and just have a little peek see\nif there's guys up the road what's going\non what's Happening going through the\nsharp corner right here a lot of guys\ndidn't take it as fast as you actually\ncould so that would be one of my\nadvantages if I wanted to attack or make\na difference I could go very far through\nthat corner accelerate and then already\nhave a gap six years ago when I won this\nrace I formed a breakaway with three\nother riders in only the second or the\nthird lap so it can go very very quick\non a lap like this with bumps with sharp\nCorners it's very unlikely that the\nwhole pack is going to stay together\nbecause in the Peloton you don't have\nthat much Advantage only on this long\nstraight road if the Peloton is you know\nall together you may have some extra\ndraft but usually it's all once long\nsingle file line and if you're with five\nor six guys in the Breakaway you're\ngoing to be just as fast as a whole\nPeloton or even faster because these\nguys are all motivated work hard so very\nimportant to stay in the front and pick\nmy moment and that moment was gonna come\nvery very quick actually so we go\nthrough one lap where all these guys in\nfront of me were really uh hammering it\nhard and and the only thing that happens\nis that they bring Frank back to the\nPeloton so they chase him down he gets\ncaught back and then usually there's a\ncounter attack straight away but that\ndidn't really happen just yet until on\nthis uphill Road this guy in front of me\nhits the gas so as he accelerates I\ncould see it coming and it was a perfect\nmoment for me to just stay in his wheel\nand take advantage of his acceleration\nand then hit it myself we've got this\nvery sharp corner coming up my favorite\ncorner of this lap and I'm gonna go\nthrough it very quick and then\naccelerate straight away this will\nstretch up the field completely guys\nthat are not able to to go as fast\nthrough the corner they have to really\nput down a lot more power to get back on\nthe guy in front of them and I right now\nthere's only two guys with me right now\nthe 29 guy and Swan biscar mola he's in\nfront of me with number five and he\ntakes a pool straight away perfect\ntiming I look behind me and we are\nstretching up the field big time through\nstart finish again only seven minutes in\nthe race I take over from swen and we'll\njust keep up the pace you can see my\npower is between four and 500 watts\napproaching this corner right now and\nstill we have this 29 guy who is with us\nand for the rest everybody is behind us\nstill trying to chase us down so there's\na big long single foul line behind me\nand we are just going hard the race is\nalways depicted by only a few key\nmoments and this was going to be one of\nthem so we just keep up the pace going\nover these brick roads and now there's\nonly one other guy number 10 here who's\nable to take a pool I think he saw us\ngoing he saw his moment to be in this\nBreakaway but for the rest there's\nnobody so we're going over the long\nstraight approaching start finish again\nand I'm in the front and I look behind\nme I see one big single file line the\nwhole Peloton and I slow down my face\nbut no one takes a pool and then it's\nwhen who flies by again and he just\nkeeps on pushing but nobody reacts and\nhe's just disappearing already so at\nthis moment I still see no one really\nresponding only two guys in front of me\nwho are going after him and behind me\nthere's nothing so at this moment I knew\nokay everybody is already hurting\nthey're already tired from this one\nreally fast lap so I have to keep it up\njust full gas right now and we're gonna\nstretch this elastic band and make it\nsnap so now we've got only Albert number\n21 in front of me in red and blue he was\nthe only guy who was able to go with us\nand we actually got a gap really quick\nso now it was a matter of going all in\nestablish that Gap and break the\nmotivation of the Peloton as soon soon\nas you're out of sight because of all\nthese Corners that's a good sign to stay\naway open and swen worked very well and\nrotated efficiently and already\novertaking the first few drop Riders\nArchie star finish again 16 minutes in\nthe race and we've managed to get 20\nseconds on the Peloton so that's very\nvery good they're ringing the bell and\nthat's because of its Supreme lap so\nthere's not only an end prize but there\nwere also going to be in between prices\nwhich they're called Prince and in the\nNetherlands usually the first few Riders\nwill get a prize so not only the first\nRider that will pass the finish on the\nnext lap but the first five will get a\nsmall preview besides those prizes\nthere's also a leader bring a leader\nprize so the guy that passes start\nfinish as the first Rider the most will\nalso get a leader prize because this is\na Prem lap it could be potentially a\nmoment where the Peloton drives up the\nbase because they're going to you know\nSprint for those creams and then when\nthey go super fast they could catch us\nback so at this moment it's very\nimportant to just go fast and stay in\nfront because if they would reduce our\nGap to only a few seconds then other\nguys would try to bridge it and you do\nnot want that when you have a nice\nestablished Breakaway it's best to just\nride it out to the to the Finish\nobviously because you've put in all the\nwork at this moment I did notice that\nAlbert was skipping a few pools now it\ncan be a multiple of things either he\nwas going to go for the pream he was\ngetting tired it was also very very hot\nso maybe he had a just a weak moment at\nthat stage or he was starting to slack\nand trying to conserve energy for the\nFinish but we're still so far out we\nstill have 47k to go that if he's\nalready\nfading now that would mean that I was\ngoing to be only with Schwinn towards\nthe finish and that was going to be very\nvery hard for another 50k so you know in\nmy head I'm thinking about multiple\nscenarios that can happen right now and\nI don't want to waste my energy in a\nbreakaway that's not going to stick a\nbit further in the race 25 minutes\nAlbert started to rotate again with us\nso I was still quite confident that we\ncould keep it up and we're keeping to\nincrease that gap on the pedals on\nhaving 35 seconds on them already so it\nwas going very well we started to run\nlike an oiled machine fast forward a bit\nwe are 30 kilometers in so we're halfway\nthe race and we are approaching the\nPeloton we're about to lap the Peloton\nso there's two things you can do you can\neither\nride with the pelot zone for the rest of\nthe race then you will still be the\nfirst Rider uh when the race finishes\nbut for all the prems the whole pattern\nis actually uh sort of sprinting with\nyou again so then the whole pattern\nwould be sprinting for every Prim lab\nand they would be able to get the first\nring it's kind of a weird system if you\nstay behind the Peloton and you're with\na breakaway of a few few Riders you\nwould still get the first price the\nfirst second and third prize in this\noccasion because we're with three\nit gets more complicated because there's\ntwo Chasers behind us so we have us\nthree then two Chasers and then the\nPeloton so if we\nfuse with the Peloton the two Chasers\nwould actually get first and second\nprizes of the creams and then us\ntogether with the Peloton which Sprint\nfor third fourth and fifth place on the\nbeams not for the end price only for the\nprims so for us it was a matter of go\nthrough the Peloton and overtake him\nstraight away swen chooses the left I\nthought that was not a smart move I go\nto the right and I get to overtake like\nuh 20 riders in one corner so it's way\neasier and it saves you a lot of energy\nsince everybody's always going to the\noutside of the corner before they stare\nin you know overtaking on the inside is\nway easier kind of looks like you're\ndive bombing but you have to do it in\nthe right way where you can just slide\nin in between two Riders and then you\ndon't mess up other guys it's a little\nlater Sven and Oliver join me at the\nfront and the rest of the Peloton sort\nof stayed behind except the core in\nfront of me right now with the orange\nsocks this guy is super strong dude I\nsaw in previous uh races he must have\nmissed out on the Breakaway today and he\ntold me he was kind of uh slowing down\nthe pace for the two Chasers that were\nchasing us so they could stay away from\nthe Peloton I was just wondering where\nAlbert was he seemed to be skipping a\nfew pools and I think he was getting\nsmoked which is not very crazy because\nit was such a hot day today I had 33\ndegrees Celsius on my head unit whole\ntime which is really really hot for us\nDutch people the human body is actually\npretty good at adapting to the heat but\nit does take time you need to ride\nprovide multiple rides or races in hot\nconditions for your body to really\nadjust and this was one of the first\ndays it was really really hot so really\ntough conditions for us always back in\nthe front and the rest is just trading\nbehind us which was going to get a bit\nannoying we're two-thirds in 54 minutes\nthe whole time the Peloton leaves us\nriding at the front us three of the\nBreakaway but now we have a preem lap\nand this is where it gets weird because\nwe are with the Peloton we're Racing for\nthe same green spots so right now the\ntwo Chasers will get first and second\nplace on the dream and we will be racing\nagainst the Peloton for the third fourth\nand fifth place so as we are approaching\nthe finish of the Prem lab\nthe guys in the Peloton start sprinting\nfor these prizes so they leave us riding\nat the front for 15 or 20 minutes and\nthen as it comes to the brim they start\nopening up the gas to get those Springs\nwell I wasn't gonna be sprinting for\nthat because we had still had 20K to go\nand obviously for us the end prize was\nmore important oh so that's how you're\ngonna play it that's all I needed in it\nit became personal with me this whole\nsituation did irritate me a little bit I\nwanted to get rid of the Peloton these\nguys were just dragging behind us anyway\nand also the two allies that I had until\nnow the guys at the break I could see\nthey were getting tired and so was I I\nstarted to feel some light cramps coming\nup already and it was mainly the heat it\nwas just draining the energy but I was\nsuper motivated and this\nstupid situation with these dreams was\njust motivating me more to uh to go full\ngas so five minutes late there we're\napproaching this sharp corner again and\nI just give it a punch I accelerate\ntowards the corner and this spot is\nactually the best one for me to try to\nget a gap fast through this corner and\nthen a strong acceleration out of it\nwould just open up a gap behind me I\nwould force the other guys to work very\nhard to stay with me looking back I\ncould see them grinding behind me and at\nthis moment twin was the only one who\ncould still stay with me and it took a\nbit longer for the rest to get in our\nwheel so the elastic band was Getting\nThinner and it was stretching and I just\nwanted to snap it so at this point I put\nin the effort and I have to really push\nhard and stay with it for a while when\nyou decide to attack or to try to force\na break or whatever you really need to\nstick with it for a little bit if you\nonly try for a few seconds and then\nthink it's not gonna happen uh it's not\ngonna happen so I stay in the front so\nwhen did the mini pool but I get back in\nthe front again and I just push hard and\nI can see it's all stretching out but\nthey're still there for the Peloton guys\nit's a lot easier to stay in our wheel\nbecause they've been riding with a big\ngroup and we already left them once so\nthey're probably less tired than us so\neven me pushing very hard for them it's\neasy to stay in a draft so I almost did\na full lap in first wheel and I just go\nthrough this corner very fast again\naccelerate hard out of it which really\npushes pressure on these other guys they\nreally have to go hard to get back into\nmy wheel but they're still there we\nstill have Albert and swin with me and\nthe rest of the guys behind me one lap\nlater\nmy body core is approaching me he's\nasking me hey man are you trying to uh\nrip it into pieces I'm like yeah dude I\nwant to get rid of the Peloton\nso he gave it a little Bunch so there he\ngoes and how big monster pool from core\nand I jump on his wheel straight away\nbehind him I'm pushing four or 500 watts\nto stay in his wheel and I just keep on\nrotation stretching up the whole\npentaton behind me I see the whole back\nin a straight line serious watch\nthrowing down here uh heart rate going\nall the way up\n188 so that's crazy and part of it was\nalso because of the heat for taking\nanother Pool so he was really working\nwith us it was really nice we've got 13\nkilometers to go and it would just be\nreally cool to to separate again and to\ntry to finish at least with us three by\nourselves and not with the whole belt on\napproaching start finish I look behind\nme and I see that the whole Peloton was\nkind of chasing us and my Breakaway guys\nwere actually being brought back by the\nPeloton grabbing a water bottle from a\nbrother thanks dude as soon as core was\nnext to me I'm like dude this is not\ngonna happen because uh these guys are\njust closing the gap\nand four stop pulling and as soon as he\ndid that\nthe whole bellaton just slowed down they\nwere not chasing me they were chasing\nhim so as soon as I noticed that\nstraight back on the gas and so right\nnow I'm by myself I'm so glowing I've\ngot 12K to go and I'm just pushing out\nall I have trying to break away from the\nBreakaway 12K is still a long way to go\nI was getting really really tired\nbecause of the heat because of the the\nefforts but dude if I could finish this\nrace in a Solo how awesome would that be\nI've never finished the race by a big\nsolo so this was going to be the first\ntime heart rate is up to 188 again I'm\nreally on my limit pushing as much as I\ncan I figured I'm gonna try to push\naround my threshold so somewhere around\n400 watts on the straights but even that\nwas quite high for these conditions\nlooking behind me I just saw them\nslowing down this big effort these two\nfast laps really took a toll on them and\nI got a gap really really quick\nhello here\nso from now it was a solo TT towards the\nfinish it was really a matter of keeping\nup this effort trying to make it as\nsteady as I could and just keep up the\nGap towards the other guys of the\noriginal Breakaway but they were riding\nwith the Peloton so I had no idea if\nthey would speed it up towards the end\nor not so I figured it was another like\n20 minutes or less to go so just go as\nhard as you can try to increase the gap\nor keep up the Gap because all the time\nI was in my mind like uh maybe they're\ngonna catch me back just before they\nfinish and this whole effort was gonna\nbe for nothing and I put in so much work\nright now so much effort I really really\nwanted to keep it up and to get my first\nsolo finish in my hometown my previous\nHometown that was really cool so in this\nrace looking at the details after I was\nfinished I was averaging\n179 beats per minute heart rate over the\nwhole race an hour and 28 I had my Peak\n20 minute heart rate on the last 12\nmonths and a big 60 Minute heart rate of\nthe last 12 months and today's plan\nsuggested a new threshold heart rate of\n186 beats a minute now that suggestion\nis off I know that because of you the\nheat it was so hot that my heart rate\nwas a lot higher than normal but the\nfact that it comes with a suggestion\nlike that does show how hard the race\nreally was I know it's all about power\nbut your heart rate is showing what your\nbody is actually you know feeling what\nit's doing so it was just intense and I\nwas really helped by my brother giving\nme extra bottles of water because I only\nhad two bottles to start with and the\nbottles that I got from him on the\nsidelines I use it to drink extra but\nalso to throw over my back and really to\ncool down a little bit with\neven though all this extra liquid I was\nstill getting cramps and it was getting\nworse and worse only 6K to go and I\nheard the speaker mentioning last lap so\nI thought that was in the last lap I'm\ngoing all out right now heart rate's\ngoing up to 189 I'm really pushing it\nbut then I noticed that I made a mistake\nand they called last lap for the Peloton\nand not for me I actually had five laps\nto go so\nbecause I thought it was the last lap I\nfigured if they're gonna Sprint for the\nFinish they are ramping it up maybe\nthey're gonna catch me back but that\nwasn't the case so I kind of emptied the\ntank but now I have to keep up for\nanother five laps another 6K so there\nwas kind of a mental bummer but luckily\nI had a big enough of a gap in front of\nthe other guy so I could sort of\nrecuperate a little bit and then you\nknow keep up the same Pace again\nat this moment the cramps in my legs are\ngetting worse and I couldn't even keep\nmy outside foot down in a corner\nnormally in a right turn like this I\nwould push down on the left pedal to\nkeep your body weight distributed in a\nright way on the bike you go through the\ncorners fast but at this moment if I\nwould straighten up my leg and push down\non it it would actually cramp up so I\nhad to sort of keep my pedals level as I\nwas going through the corners it was\nreally weird because if I wouldn't do\nthat my leg would just walk off another\nbottle and now we're skipping to the\nlast left\ngo go\ngo go go Daisy has also arrived she was\nthere with the kids and they were gonna\ndo the Strider race later after my race\nand I just kept on pushing hard I\nactually had no idea how far the rest\nwas behind me I just pushed everything I\nhad to maintain this Gap and you see it\nso many times that the solar Rider gets\ncaught on the line just before the\nfinish I didn't dare to look back until\njust two corners to go and then I just\nsaw nobody\nentering at long last right I couldn't\nsee them behind me so I knew I had this\nrace in the pool\nservice\n[Applause]\nyes yes yes\nsix years later I get it back\nsoon after uh we're gonna do the prize\ngiving I'm on the box and then so I'm\ngonna make are gonna race on the\nStriders so after this I'm gonna go\nright there and then we're gonna follow\nour my kids\nforeign\nthey all blew straight through the\nFinish they just keep on going hey\nMickey Mickey\nyes\nhey guys uh really really awesome to win\nthis race in front of my sort of Home\ncrowd with a solo with these guys\nnext week I'm racing today only another\n200 kilometer mountain bike marathon and\nthen I'm going to Denmark for like up to\ntwo or so stay tuned I'm gonna see you\nin the next video\nsee ya"
