SUBSCRIBE for Race Content \ud83d\udc49 https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsr-SU_SAqjrzmu4kXIRfUQ?sub_confirmation=1\n\nLead group 38 mi  race! \n\nFinal gravel race of the season! Since I locked up 4th place in the overall Michigan Gravel Race Series (MGRS) and couldn't gain enough points to overtake 3rd, I decided to make this my Iceman MTB race prep. The short course, 39 miles, would be closer to my expected Iceman finish time in 2 weeks, so I raced that distance instead of my typical long course 56 mile. I didn't feel the best on the day but I was able to hold onto the front group into the final 20 person sprint. Legs were cooked by then and I made some poor tactical decisions in the end, which left me way back and out of position for the sprint. I was able to salvage 8th place overall, 2nd in my age group. \n\nHeld on October 25,  2025, this was the last race of the gravel season and the Michigan Gravel Race Series. The Lowell gravel race is a classic style gravel race. You race along the banks of the Flat River and through rural Ionia County, MI on approximately 95% unpaved roads. You can choose from either the 56, 39 or 15 mile routes, all are single loops. The race start sand finishes at Fallasburg County Park, Lowell, MI. \n\n\ud83d\udc49 Hey!
