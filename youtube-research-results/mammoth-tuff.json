      "transcript": "[Music]\nZach from gravel by California back in\nMammoth ready to bring you the action\nfrom Mammoth puff\nagain I've said this before this is my\nfavorite event not just because the\nriding is fantastic but just kind of the\ncommunity around here the village is\nfantastic and everything is here to do\nand you run into people all over the\nplace here at the same time you've got\nplenty of time to go out and about in so\nmuch gorgeous Majesty just nearby now\nthis year instead of doing the middle\ntougher distance I'm doing the tough\nwhich is the shortest one and the little\nWrinkle in that is my wife is joining\nnow if you've seen my video about best\nrides to get into gravel Mammoth tough\nalso falls on on that list as well\nso ready to bring that and hopefully\nspread the joy\nso let's\nroll or\nrun we're laser focused on returning to\na good time at Mammoth tough with so\nmuch Majesty to explore above at Mammoth\nLakes while also having a great Central\nhub crossing paths with all the\ngravers as the village is perfectly\nsituated in the heart of it\nall with a 4 and 1/ half hour drive up\nVic and I stopped off to ride onion\nValley Road starting near the halfway\npoint at grav Meadow Campground for my\nfavorite alltime climb covered in a\nprevious\nvideo just nothing beats these epic\nfeatures built within the upper eight\nswitchbacks constantly changing your\norientation adding to this\npresentation though we were just missing\nout being on the cusp of fall colors\nexploding we weren't the only ones out\nhere enjoying these Monumental views\nwith this ginormous scale as we would\nsoon cross above 9,000 ft seeing the\nmodern pathway up contrasting with the\nold having plenty of time to enjoy it\nall at these\nspeeds we were feeling pretty good at\nhigh altitude getting shut in by the\nsurrounding Peaks at the end of the line\nwith kirar pass a heck of a hike to\nreach while it's hard to find a good\nengineering solution that was the\noriginal plan for onion Valley Road to\nspan the Sierra through\nhere the downhill experience is just as\nmemorable but there was a big twist this\ntime riding on tires over half as wide\nbeing a great counterbalance to these\nlarge Expansion Joints even increasing\nmy speed on The Descent this go around\nthis descent got us done in plenty of\ntime for checkin at the alpenhof lodge\nin daylight situated right across the\nstreet from the village with updated\nrooms since our previous day also\nskipping distance to Mammoth Brewing\nthat's a great laid-back spot for get\ntogether as a yes I'm\nrecording I brought back the tradition\nof my pre- ShakeOut ride where a number\nof likeminded I'm already awake Riders\njoined in including the gravel sto crew\nas we started this Six Mile climb on\npavement with a quick stop at the Midway\npoint at the ski lodge as I was not\nexpecting to feel the effects of this\naltitude a problem I didn't have at this\nelevation\nyesterday veering away from Devil's\npostpile National Monument we absorbed\nthe best view of the day from minet\nVista and while I didn't find the most\ndirect path you could see Jeff from\nspinnergy chomping at the bit to let his\nwheels do the work as there was a\nproblem with me leading this ride not\njust because I had no one in front to\nfilm but also how this density didn't\nseem familiar which I could Overlook\nenjoying all this sway with only one\nunscheduled stop along the way sharing\nthe trail with other off-road\nenthusiasts I was starting to have\nflashbacks of the good kind now\nrecognizing this white pacy sand but at\nthis elevation it doesn't come off as\ntoo soft making them Mountain View Trail\nthe most playful bang for the buck of\nthe weekend\nwe exited out of the Uptown Trail making\na beine across town with plenty a time\nto make the official ShakeOut ride which\nAmanda explained to me also being\nco-hosted with the think gravel it's\nFriday crew as I was policing hand\ngestures while they did the heavy\nlifting we headed on to Sawmill cut off\nroad with just enough fingers to qualify\nas we hit the dirt giving some here\ntheir first taste of Mammoth off-roading\ncovering the initial dirt sector of the\nmiddle tougher course\nwith dom and Jace leading the way the\ndownhill was the first opportunity for a\ngear check gauging how well you've done\nwith your tire selection maneuvering\ndown this fast and loose surface and\nwhile normally I would have gone with my\ntypical\n45s I was using Mammoth tough as an\nopportunity to test out\n55s really thankful for this happy\naccident with smiles from everyone\ngetting through this first\nsection heading back along the\n395 I got to spend some quality time\ncatching up with Nolan from the bike\nsauce seeing more approved signals that\ntraffic wasn't an\nissue if there was something first timr\nneeded to experience it was the final\ndirt climb for all routs of Sawmill Road\nwhich becomes a battle with the sand\nnear the top and we were riding before\nthe afternoon wind kicked in but we did\nget some extra credit to lift our\nSpirits with a little single track loop\naround Shady Rest Park the new Turf for\nme paralleling back off a sawmill cut\noff road before we called it a day or\nmore of a\nShakeOut we made a pit stop back at\nStellar Cafe giving free advice to Jonas\nWoodruff not to win by too much as some\nnecessary sustenance was needed with\nmore physical activity on the\nway heading back to the Village the main\npurpose here was supposed to be packet\npickup with gravel Stoke literally\ndefining the word popup packed with a\nnumber of available goodies and I'm\ngoing to ask about that table\ntoo after getting my ride packet Amanda\nand Joey questioned my water credibility\nfighting my way in today's Premier event\nback against stiff competition ition for\nthe mammoth buff Beer Run knowing I'd be\ngoing to battle with these heavy weights\nas Amanda explained it was beer then lap\nthree times although I'd have trouble\nkeeping count getting ready to file my\nfalse start\nappeal one\ngo anything good about drinking a beer\nfirst it kept me from redlining off the\ngun again this time taking a more\nconservative approach and while my plan\nwas to take it and AER in the second lap\nwho knew I'd fall to good old peer\npressure as by lap three I lost all\nrationality but this year I saved for\nsprinting power finishing seventh meing\nto check if this was an Olympic\nqualifier Champions aren't a mistake\nthey're born and in the ladies\nsecond it looked like we showed up late\nbut just in time to see the tougher\ngroup off with a pretty deep field all\nlined up rolling out together in smooth\nfashion at the gun ready for the next 40\nmiles that would keep a smile on us the\nwhole\ntime the tough route has four\nsignificant segments to focus on after\nsome up and down on the road the next 6\nmiles down into the Ino National Forest\nis a hydroplaning Clinic cutting through\nsand\nthe next 3 m east of the 395 carries the\nfun dodging around like a trench run in\nStar\nWars after going back into the forest\nthe next 9 miles on Owens Valley Road\noffers some flat gorgeous\nperception the final test is a climb up\nSawmill cut off which you want to\ncomplete before the winds kick up in the\nafternoon all in all the tough rout\ncovers 40 m with a deceptively tough\n2300 ft of\nclimbing we looped around the village\nwhere Barb and Vic already activated\ntheir climbing legs on a gentl is one\nand a/4 mile Ascent turning onto Mammoth\nScenic Loop that would be mostly\ndownhill on this route feeling warmer\nthan it looked at this hour so much you\ncouldn't care with this air throwing\nyour hands up\nspeed would shift this definition right\nbefore the Four Mile Mark making a big\nsweeping turn onto Dry Creek Road ready\nto start the dirt that was pretty tame\noff the\nbat while you might see signage out here\nis expected to download the route for\nnavigation as there's a bevy of\noffshoots in this region but perhaps the\nlarger focus is on the downhill that was\na technical way to be starting off your\noff-roading although there were other\ndust UPS\nahead wherever the grade was not as\npronounced you tended to find deeper\npockets of sand providing some\nchallenges keeping a straight line\nseeing how Tire Choice and bike types\nhandled the conditions\ndifferently for being thrown into the\nfire For the First Time Mrs GBC was\nhandling these circumstances really well\nand part of it is thanks to borrowing\nTroy templin ebike with 2.4 inch tires\nto boot as I was forming my hypothesis\nthat it was sandier this year or people\nwere getting into socializing\nmore it felt like the trees were closing\nin with the sun getting more picky went\nto show itself but I was fortunate to be\non top of my loaded route also revealing\nwe were close to paralleling the main\nroad Although our eyes told this\ndifferently finally reconnecting where I\nwas proud how she handled the most\ntechnical part of the\nday it was great there's one part where\nI was really I had my running shoes on\nbecause the S was just too thick and I\nran through it a little bit but I was\nhappy we headed south to ultimately go\nnorth on the\n395 turning off the highway for a safety\nplay glad to have these nicely\nmaintained tunnels although of course\nwhat was waiting for us on the way\nout with a nice 3/4 of a mile to stretch\nout our legs and arms we got back to\neven more devilish downhilling beginning\nour playful run around Lookout\nMountain it's an adjustment for first\ntimers for these conditions as the road\nWades between pavement and pomus where\nit may seem counterintuitive at first\nbut you have to trust speed as an ally\nusing the stretches of asphalt as a\nspringboard to produce more momentum\nbefore the dirt gets\nsoft since the road never degrades\nevenly you have to keep your eyes peeled\nwhich side to place across as I can see\nconfidence building with Barb leaving us\nwith plenty of time to enjoy the rest of\nthis\nroad we got more of that flying feeling\nturning on to Owens Valley Road bringing\na smile not just for the sensation but\nalso this little introductory view for\nwhat's ahead as it was a bit of a tease\nturning back into the forest into the\nonly section of today's route I've never\nridden before that ended up being smooth\nafter this early\nHarbinger this threemile diversion kept\na steady elevation profile without\nbattling the high highs or low lows\nsmooth enough raising my interest to\nexplore these roads more but it was wise\nto stick with what I knew\nnow while the riding here was better\nthan I expected I was eager for the next\nphase with the trees starting to make\nway for the mountains which the trail\nnow made a straight line to getting\nready to enjoy the Owens Valley with\nmore opportunity to do it from all\nangles no Road makes me appreciate the\nact of inhaling than Owens Valley Road\nnot just for the space provided to roam\naround but with so much of a grand scale\nin front of us and affirmed in every\ndirection you will find parts a bit wash\nboardy along the way which explains why\nyou'll find the entire width used to\nfind the smoothest path with everywhere\nthere seems distance as arcularius Ranch\nhas trouble finding its neighbors but\nthe universal theme was seeing all the\npositive energy around as there's no\nbetter way to experience this area than\non bikes hoping the turbo won't shorten\nour time here because there's just so\nmuch to see\nright\na lot of first timers are likely\nsurprised by hot Creek providing a\ncontrast and elegance to these golden\nsurroundings let alone just playing a\npart of Prairie Life as we were starting\nour last quarter of today's route\nturning West onto Hot Creek Hatchery\nRoad where our Pit Stop was comfortably\nplaced along one of the most scenic\nspots on the Waterway able to handle the\nvolume of all the incoming outfitted\nwith a couple of Handy mechanics and\nplenty of variety for food and\ndrink STP waffle it's delicious it's\nonly 150 calories and it's going to help\nme power through the\nmorning if you've been worried about\nyour selfie game there were plenty of\nphotog to take care of that for you with\njust 3 miles back to the highway rolling\nby the biggest compilation of structures\nalong the creek explaining the meaning\nof the road's name as it was great to\nI'm not paying attention seeing the\nnumber of adaptive cyclists out there\nthat were hard to keep up with using\nsome non UCI approved tactics just to\nmatch\nPace turning on to a a fast mile and a\nhalf on the\n395 thanks to low wind and a big\nshoulder we transition onto the above\nground substation Road well we had one\nlast challenge familiar to me in Sawmill\ncut off which felt easier today with\nless people around giving me more space\nto find My Line in the Sand although the\nebike was fast enough to give time for a\nstroll while I caught\nup After exiting back back into Shady\nRest Park we did a tighter loop around\nthis time leaving our final segment of\ndirt feeling very accomplished for\ntoday's effort even though we still had\nthat one last mile climb up Main Street\nwhere hopefully Keegan didn't wait long\nfor a high five and maybe there was a\nSprint between us in the Finish But\nultimately Barb came out ahead with her\nphoto bomb\nskills Amanda got instant feedback we\nwere in disagreement who had a better\ntime as a thank gravel at Friday crew\nenjoyed this Saturday with Jonas\ncomfortably taking the win in the\ntoughest route noticing he was wearing\nRoad shoes just adding to the degree of\ndifficulty we quickly cleaned up since\nour stay was nearby returning to one of\nmy favorites in shelter Distillery for\nlunch that had a lot of other\nlike-minded finishers with a lot of\nstories to share some of them\ntrue I see these sunglasses but what are\nthese what is\nwhat the only\n[Laughter]\none the beauty of the day was we still\nhad time to explore because Mammoth\nLakes really has lakes not to mention a\nlot of active infrastructure here making\nit a well fought out place to bike or\nrun\nwith so many opportunities to take in\nthe views as we have plenty of time just\nto relax feeling like we had a week of\nmemories in only one\nday in my own self-interest I should\nprobably end the video here as there's\nalways a big crowd assembled Sunday\nbecause the mammoth tough raffle is in a\nclass of its own with people preparing\nfor the drawing as much as the ride as\nAmanda and Dave handle more numbers than\nin A Beautiful Mind celebrating with a\nnumber of winners that we felt being a\npart of just being a piece of Mammoth\ntough what can I say Mammoth tough\nchecked all the boxes first of all the\nriding the day of perfect weather just a\ngreat way to experience the Eastern\nSierra and then throw in the\nextracurriculars\nwhen we went up to mined fista and onion\nValley so many great opportunities\naround here also the atmosphere just\nsuch a great place to celebrate the\ngravel Community with everything around\nhere and running into everyone and of\ncourse the scenery throw in some\nself-inflicted embarrassment I think we\ncame out well ahead bottom line my wife\nhad a fantastic time and it was a little\nSandy but I know she'll be back and so\nAl Li anyways you want to support us go\nhit the Subscribe button support our\nshop or support us on patreon so we can\nbring you\nmore from the state of dirt\n[Applause]"

      "transcript": "[Music]\nforeign\nZach here in the Eastern Sierra ready to\ntake you to the highly anticipated\nMammoth tough now I've said many times\nthat this is my most favorite Area\nCalifornia at the right time of the year\nbecause of its immense scale and fall\ncolors\npart of my love has come from Dave and\nAmanda for bringing this event to the\narea and to also introduce Mammoth as a\ndestination this is a weekend where\nthere's a lot packed in so\nLet's Roll\na run\nwhile the center piece of Mammoth puff\nwas arrived the smart plan is to make\nthis a destination weekend not just to\nacclimate to the elevation but for all\nthe activities as well\nwith everyone eager for what the\ninaugural event would have in store\nyeah I'm excited for everybody that is\ncoming for their first gravel event so\nI'm hoping people walk away with a true\nexperience of what it means to go out\ninto the middle of nowhere have a fun\nadventure come back and just celebrate\nthat with a bunch of people who did the\nsame thing that you did\nno matter what route you're on kind of\nwhen you get out to those open roads in\nthe Owens River Valley it's going to be\nviews any Direction they look right 360\nDegrees you can look around there's a\nview along the way stop in and take a\npicture is definitely worth it it's very\nunique I think when people think of\ngravel it's hard packed stone and you\ncan crunch it and if you get up here and\nall of a sudden the pumice is light and\nAiry and it moves away from your tires\nand it's a whole new learning experience\nso I hope people realize that the\nwriting appears completely unique\nbecause of all the old volcanic activity\nand that you're not going to find it\nanywhere else so you gotta learn how to\nride it specifically for up here get\ntires that work up here it's a whole\nlearning experience and I think a lot of\npeople are going to learn that tomorrow\nyeah I mean you just want to ride it in\nyour endurance page it's like you want\nto ride at like uh five to six all day\nand save those efforts that are a little\nabove it because eight might be kind of\nat your limiter's threshold and so yeah\naltitudes and you can breathe a little\nbit more so respect it drink extra stay\nhydrated\nthinking when I headed up the 395 on\nThursday picking in a ride to help us\nwith the altitude\nstopping off at the century old Tom's\nPlace to climb Rock Creek with the\nunknown distinction to Vic to lure him\nup\ndo you know that this is the highest\npaved Road in California did not know\nthat it makes sense because I'm with you\nthis is a 10 and a half mile climb that\nby paralleling the creek keeps a steady\nfive percent except for that Punchy\nSecond Mile as you'll remember more of\nthese High Sierra views as the bottom\nhalf is wide open while the top more\nlined with trees\nbut we also came across a series of\ncyclists\nthe scenery got livelier too coming\nacross Rock Creek Lake as well as a\ncouple of other establishments including\na pack station as the road Narrows to\none lane\nbut the last mile and a half was the\nbest\njust being up close and Camera ready\nas reaching mosquito Flats was gorgeous\nunless you were circling the lot for\nspots\nbut biking makes it more attuned for\npictures\nand the elevation didn't seem to be a\nfactor except when it's time to turn\naround because you're going to want to\nbring along a jacket so you can focus on\nthese views\nwe made our way to our hotel to the\nconveniently situated alpenhof Lodge\nwith a couple of dining choices built in\nbut also glad to be just across from the\nvillage\nwhere most of the action took place\nFriday had a pre-ride in the late\nmorning and I got the feeling there\nwould be other seat deprived GBC ears\nlooking to get a few miles in early\nso I put together a fun 13 Mile loop\nwith some single track payoff on the way\ndown\nit was six miles to the peak on minaret\nroad at a real steady grade\nand a short reprieve halfway up\nhitting the lodge only a half mile later\nwhere the fee based Uptown Trail\noriginates\nbut we continue to head on pavement\nveering away from postpile Road\nand reaching reason enough alone why to\ndo this ride taking in the Panorama from\nminaret Vista which is truly rarefied\nair\nas looking across to the 13 000 foot\nMountain Ritter and its surroundings is\nso voluminous in person\nthe good news if you're nearsighted that\nthere's still plenty of fun for you\ntaking the Mountain View Trail to the\nUptown Trail which is nearly seven miles\ntransforming you into a downhill\nDaredevil\nthe dirt exited us right by the start\nbut there wasn't time for chit chat\nneeding to hightail it from the pre-ride\npre-ride\nto make it within minutes of the\nas the large group was awaiting us at\nFootloose Sports\nbut not for long heading back up Main\nStreet\nbeing led by an exuberant Amanda with\nthe tough start only hours away\nfeeding the excitement of the Village\nPeople\nas this 19-mile Loop was a proper\nwarm-up covering the first third section\nof the shore course and the final piece\nof off-road all faced at the end\nwe headed up minaret road to Mammoth\nScenic Loop but Amanda gave us some good\nnotes before we went down\nas I remember the trickiness previously\nriding this dirt in the opposite\ndirection\nor some might say wrong direction\nas everyone looked prepared to Let It\nWhip feeling the enthusiasm as we were\nready to hit Bravo\nas this was only supposed to be a\npre-ride everyone was ready to chop it\nup one way or another while a good\nportion of riders would be on other\ncourses tomorrow\nthis long descent gave people an idea of\nwhat's in front of them as this pumicey\nsand is a byproduct from Owens Valley\nmeaning you have to Pedal through\ndespite what gravity is telling you and\ngetting ready for a taste of Tatooine\nletting you know if your tire pressure\nis on point making me confident about\nSaturday\nas we made it back to Mammoth Scenic\nLoop all feeling good about ourselves\nour expedited return include a quick\nfive miles on 395 but coming off the\nhighway didn't mean the most direct\nroute back\npreviewing the final two mile dirt climb\nwhich everyone was pushing the pace\nbut take note is that would be a\ndifferent story tomorrow\nwe said our goodbyes but today's\nentertainment wasn't over with the\nmammoth buff Beer Mile going off that\nafternoon with a festive move already as\nparticipants had to drink a pipe between\nthird of a mile laps and watching the\nwomen go at it first prompted\nquestioning my life choices\nseeing that consuming beverages with a\ncertain ABV wasn't so simple but my\nbelief that it was still the same Runner\nwho ran a sub three hour marathon years\nago\nwas shut down early in the first lap not\njust from these particular fluids\nbut how I flatlined starting all out at\nthis elevation with others pacing\nthemselves better as I was happy to\nfinish with muscles I haven't used for\nyears and checking on each breath as if\nit was my last\nso how do you feel Zachary do not let my\nfamily see this\nrace day was finally here and the\nbutterflies were all gone\nwith the excitement already palpable and\nthe temps warmer than we thought\nbut Troy from road bike actions\nprediction for finishing an 11 hours 11\nseconds seemed accurate as we tackled\nthe tougher medium course which seems\nTim looking at the numbers but is far\nmore hostile in practice\nDave was literally stoked to get moving\nas a controlled starts at a happy tone\nespecially setting off with little\neffort but the ride heated up turning\nonto Sawmill cut off\nso much I started drifting back taking\noff my jacket causing my irrational\nrationalism to take over\nburning some early matches to make it\nback up to the front\nand even getting a Kom on the first\nclimb\nbut even hitting the loose downhill I\nhad a lot of ground to make up hoping\nI'd find the group going under the 395\nit may be surprising a few making it\nback\nwith four and a half miles left in the\nforest\nthe big challenge for staying on course\nas this section was mostly downhill\nmaking it difficult to navigate around\nthe Myriad of offshoots but it was an\nadrenaline rush picking your line\ntaking advantage when the pavement\nappears bobbing and leaping our way\nthrough these Long Shadows\nno denying the fun Factor but getting\nback on concrete again brought a whole\nnew shift seeing the larger character of\nThe Ride introducing itself as a symptom\nof exiting the forest\nand marveling at the scale of this open\nspace\ncrossing over the cattle guard ends your\nencounter with pavement for the next 12\nmiles\nbut as the sector is hovering around\n7000 feet there's a lot to consider here\nlike picking the correct line to avoid\nthe washboard\nstaying clear from dust of passing\ntraffic\nnot to mention making sure your bike is\nin correct working order\nnow truly facing the elements\nbut also looking for the same set of\nbovines that jumped in front of the\nfence two years ago\nthey recognize me\nto me the distractions were minor with\nthe true Joy being around these unique\nsurroundings\nand seeing the look of others with their\nDelight which was a special shared\nexperience\nwith little fanfare we transitioned onto\nBenton Crossing for our longest pave\nsegment of the day hammering out an\nefficient 10 miles making it across a\npopular spot on the Owens River which\nits Campground might have been\nresponsible for the earlier dust ups but\nriding in a group was ideal as the first\nrest stop wasn't until mile 48 and\npassing Crowley Lake that we had 18 to\ngo as I ended needing just two bottles\nout of the four to get there even after\nembarking on this Four Mile climb\naveraging a semi-consistent 3 percent\ngetting an early read on the upcoming\nlandscape which was my least anticipated\ngoing in\nthe turn off to Owens Gorge Road\nsignaled the welcome return to dirt as\nbearded from birth GBC or guy scouted\nthe Eastern Loop and was seriously\nconcerned about the bumpiness driving\nover these 12 miles\nbut Owens Gorge Road was pleasantly\nsmooth and the only slowing was for the\nscenery but our time on this\nthoroughfare was brief turning on to\nCasa Diablo Mine Cut Off Road leading\ninto over five miles of downhill\nand from guy's assessment I was\nexpecting a few teeth to pop out but it\ndidn't feel that different than the big\ndescent from yesterday's ShakeOut ride\nas it was soft and you had to ride\nthrough spots and our biggest obstacle\nhappened to be a couple of sheepdogs\ncausing a dust up so even though it\nwasn't champagne gravel and I did have\nto pick my line a couple of times it was\ngreat seeing everyone handle it the same\nkeeping up with the group until\nchain got stuck\ntime to hit the reset button\nnow alone oddly the road conditions seem\nto improve and even more so turning on\nto the similarly named Casa Diablo road\nwhich pleasantly became the highlight of\nthe day with the White Mountains\nlingering to the East and the Glass\nMountain Ridge to the north framing the\nCaldera\nseeing the beauty of this geology up\nclose but even though this was five\nmiles trending up it felt like we were\npedaling as much on the previous\ndownhill highlighting the difference in\nsurfaces\nbut I will never complain about Recon\ngoing wrong when it pertains switching a\nnegative to a positive with these\nconveniently laid out views along with\nthe Fall colors starting to pop out\nwe've rolled back onto Benton Crossing\nwhich was an easy transition off of\noff-roading but it was thumbs up being\nonly two quick miles to the aid station\nbut some of us were ready to attack the\nofferings\nin this nicely positioned downhill\nassisted as well\ncoming in feeling cheery like the\nvolunteers with the big selection of\nsnacks good vibes from Ranger Dave not\nto mention red orange green and blue\nbut I was glad to be rejoined by Vic as\nwell as Dave and Danny from gravel Stoke\nas we soon turn back to dirt for our\nmost significant climb of the day\nrising up Deer Springs Road at 5.4\npercent over three and a half miles\nthe start was tame but we had been\nexposed for over 40 miles and while this\nisn't the most colossal climb on paper\nthe underlying elements of the day\nstarted kicking in as a steeper Graves\nwasn't punishing enough on itself\nbut also making a more sustained effort\nat altitude\non a Surface not properly rewarding your\nstruggle with trees just far enough back\nnot to provide shade and few visual cues\nwhere you're headed perseverance was the\nwatchword as nearing the peak was\nsignaled High plane shifter style also\nshot in this Forest while reaching the\nApex and almost 8 000 feet is worthy of\na stop if not just to see where your\nfinal 25 miles LED\nwhile a straightish five mile descent\nmay feel like compensation for your\neffort it's best to let someone else go\nfirst with the first half mile averaging\nover 11 percent where your braking\nskills will come in handy on top of some\ntap dancing as well and as the grades\nstart to let up I could parse out Tire\nwidths without even asking also not a\nmanaging climbing let alone driving in\nthe opposite direction\nbut here we are\nstrangest phenomena was the amount of\npedaling even though gravity would\nsuggest otherwise allowing selfie action\nto grade that normally wouldn't permit\nas most would expect to conserve energy\nand not sweating out looking at the root\nunless you were smart enough to double\nup tandem style\nbut I'm glad I focused my attention\nelsewhere\nas a Sierra guided my thoughts away from\nthe hardships\nwe returned onto flattish Benton\nCrossing but now we had a new Foe and a\nheavy headwind so the smart move was\njumping onto any train passing by seeing\ntheir time trial skills were prudent and\nas the band around the Owens River took\nus Due West\nthe group properly abandoned our direct\nPace line with an Echelon formation the\nonly way to battle through\nturning back onto Owens River Road the\nfocus is getting through the last 15\nmiles and your eagerness is combated by\nheavier gusts on top of a roadway that\nlooks endless\nbut going left onto Hot Creek Hatchery\nRoad felt like progress was being made\nnot just by confirming it was properly\nnamed but that we were not too far from\nthe Aid Station and while most headed\nthere I couldn't pass up returning to\none of the most unique spots around\nto see the pureness of Blue from this\nhistoric geological site thanks to the\nbed of magma below and if other cyclists\nwanted to leave this all to myself so be\nit as I found them at the aid station\nright above with people needing a break\neven with 10 miles left as so says the\nexperts\nwhile the rest of this dirt sector looks\nstraightforward Vic would say this was\nglass half full talk as grinding your\ngears was a requirement and the\ndownhills didn't seem that much faster\nwith even the pavement not feeling like\na remedy but at least my bulby torso is\neffective at blocking wind as turning\nonto the 395 proved it kept intensifying\nthe closer we got to Mammoth Lakes at\nlevels I've never experienced before\nand moving over to the parallel Road had\npretty much the same effect just without\nthe traffic\nheading under the 395 seemed like the\nhome stretch revisiting Sawmill Road\nfrom the day before and while I\nremembered this is less than two miles\nof climbing on dirt we were changed\npeople since yesterday as now I could\nhear the Sam laughing back at us or\nmaybe we just wanted to finish after\nturning onto Main Street meant just a\nmile back wiggling our way into the\nvillage good to see friends and\nwell-wishers at the finish line\noh and Troy too\nsuper happy to post game at shelter\nDistillery where food and beverages were\ntastily provided but festivities\nactually closed on Sunday where the\nwinners were crowned and a deep prize\npool for the raffle looking like a\nbuffet with Danny coming out on top\nwalking away with a Niner frame and I'd\ngive a big thanks to Amanda and Dave but\nthey are probably still reading off\nraffle numbers\nso Mammoth tough was more than it was an\nexperience everyone that came out here\nwas able to catch ecu's I'm sure they're\nsharing with their friends family and\nbring them along next year\nEastern Sierra has not been covered\nenough and David Amanda should be very\nproud how they expose people to this\nwe knew it wasn't going to be easy but\nthe physical effort on top of all the\nfestivities\noh what a

      "transcript": "Is an Italian gravel Greyhound tough\nenough? That's what I'm here at Mammoth\nTough in California to find out. This is\nthe new Penel Grarevel F. It can handle\nup to 50 mil tires, which is what I've\nput on here. Some Italian tires, the\nVictoria T50s. I have never done Mammoth\nTough here in the beautiful Eastern\nSierra of California. I'm excited to do\nso. My buddy Chris Johnson is on another\nPinerella bike, the Dogma F, which is\nmore like a all-road bike to my eyes. is\nit can handle up to a 42, but it is a a\ngravel bike. He's going to give it a go.\nHe has squeezed some 45s in there. We'll\nsee what the insides of those chain\nstays look like at the end of the\nweekend. Bike comes in a number of\ndifferent builds. This is the Force\nbuild. It's got a 40 to. Normally, I'd\nlike a 42ish for flatter racing. There's\na lot of climbing on tap, 8,000 ft or so\nover the 80 plus miles out here at high\naltitude. We start at 8,500 feet and\ndescend down to this area where we are\nnow. Chadago Canyon, which is where we\nare, these beautiful red rock canyons. I\nhave no idea what is in store. That's\npart of the fun of gravel racing, right?\nYou put on your best guess for tires,\nfill up your bottles, give it a crack,\nand see how it goes. So, Mammoth Tough,\nis the Gravel Gravel Greyhound up for\nit? Is the old Gravel Greyhair up for\nit? Come along for the ride, and we'll\nfind out together.\n[Music]\nBaby\nOkay, then\nreset. Let's go.\nWhere's a mullet when you need it?\n&gt;&gt; All right, that is mammoth tough done\nand dusted. bike generally great. I had\ntwo main issues though. The old engine\nnot that great and the pilot is a\nchicken. But aside from that, enjoyed\nthe bike. I'm gonna go clean up, get a\nmilkshake, and then we'll come back,\ntalk about this bike. I'll see if I can\nfind my man Chris Johnson so we can talk\nabout his experience on the Dogma GR.\nHey everybody, Chris Johnson, Outdoor\nBros on YouTube. If you don't follow\nhim, get with the program. How did your\nday go, sir? What did you think of the\nbike? I thought it was great. I really\nliked just how sporty the Dogman GR was.\nI really enjoyed kind of the little bit\nof flex that was here in the seat post.\nI felt like when it got really chunky\nout there today, felt like I was never\nreally too fatigued, too uncomfortable,\nwhich was kind of surprising because I\ncame into this thinking that\n&gt;&gt; this may be actually a little bit too\naggressive of a bike for Mammoth Tough\nbecause we had the sand, we had the\ndescents, we had some chunky stuff and\n&gt;&gt; actually found it to be quite\ncomfortable. And as a guy who likes, you\nknow, kind of the faster gravel bikes,\n&gt;&gt; yeah, I felt like it was uh pretty dang\ngood.\n&gt;&gt; I was also pleasantly surprised by how\ncushy both this bike and that bike were.\nI rode that one at home and I don't know\nwhy my expectation was this one was\ngoing to be firm, maybe like a old\nschool bison against Pinella, thinking\nit was like a straight ahead race bike,\nbut it was yeah, quite plush. Some that\nwas the tires and a lot of it I think\nwas the post. Um, Pinell claims this\nmoves like a centimeter and that one\nclose to and\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think so. 8 centimeters, I\nthink.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n&gt;&gt; 8 millime.\n&gt;&gt; 8 millimeters.\n&gt;&gt; 8 centimeters.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's like the diverge SDR is a\nspin to rider. One thing that uh Pintero\nhas done for years and continues to do\nparticularly with the GR is slice the\nsizing very finely. There's like I want\nto say eight or nine sizes I think so\nfor that guy and and six for this and\nalso bars. You can get them in a lot of\ndifferent configurations. And I really\nloved how these bars felt.\n&gt;&gt; They were comfortable all day.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. It's like some like there's a bit\nof give to it. And also just the\ndimensions. Like I love how integrated\nbars look, but if they don't fit you,\nit's like what's the point of this? So\nlike having a 42 110 dial. I think we\ngot pretty similar\n&gt;&gt; fit sizes. I think you like 76 saddle\nheight and\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; That felt great. This one comes stock\nwith a 46. You can specify other ones,\nbut I felt a little bit tractor driving\nand then it flares out to 50 something.\nSo, like the last, I don't know, 20\nmiles I was riding by myself today and\nwould try to get low and I'd be out here\nlike this is not aerodynamically\noptimized. But that's something you can\nchange. This is a two-piece, but it's\ninternal. So, it's not quite as easy as\nthe old school design to change, but you\ncan change both this and you can even\nspecify when you're buying a bike uh the\ncockpit on that as you should for the\npretty penny that uh both of these,\nparticularly that guy costs.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Another way they slice it very finely is\nthe fact that there's two pretty similar\ngravel bikes. This one is a little bit\nmore all-road with a 42\n&gt;&gt; specified clearance. Although I know you\nyou push that. And then this, you know,\ngoes up to a 50 with, you know, still\nprobably 45 mil. What do you got in\nthere?\n&gt;&gt; Okay. So, I think it's actually\n&gt;&gt; Those are your 42s.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, I think it's 45 front and 42\nrear. Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And I went 45 front, 45 rear. Yeah. I've\nridden out here a bunch and I just felt\nlike with the soft sand, with the\nconditions, you know, thankfully it\nrained yesterday, but yeah, I needed as\nmuch tire as I could get.\n&gt;&gt; I screwed up the intro. I should have\nintroed you as Mr. Mammoth Lakes, which\nis the beautiful place where you are.\nChris lives in Costa Mesa. Been coming\nup here for how many years?\n&gt;&gt; Since I was a little kid.\n&gt;&gt; And now coming up here to ride bikes\n&gt;&gt; all the time. This is like Yeah. to set\nthe set the stage for what the riding\nconditions are like up here.\n&gt;&gt; One of the things about Mammoth Lakes is\nit's just like a lot of soft sand. It's\na lot of up, a lot of down. Right here\nin the mountain, I mean, everywhere you\ngo, you're going to hit this pummus\nstone sand and it is like thick almost\nlike beach sand. And I think people who\ncome from out of town and they come up\nhere and ride, they don't realize that\nuh it's actually pretty tough to ride\nthrough. So that's on the mountain side.\nAnd then you get into the valley side\nwhere we rode today and there's even\nmore of it. So,\n&gt;&gt; riding's fantastic. Rolling hills on\nthat side, a lot of up and down up here,\nbut yeah, you definitely want uh you\nwant to go pretty conservative when it\ncomes to how wide your tires need to be.\n&gt;&gt; By conservative, I mean, you know, kind\nof push the limits as much as you can\nbecause you really need it out here in\nMammoth.\n&gt;&gt; Air on the side of extra tire.\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n&gt;&gt; More rubber, more better.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, sir.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. I thought it was interesting to\nsee men's pro winner Caleb Butcher all\nthe way from New Zealand riding straight\nup slicks.\n&gt;&gt; And riding with Lance Hayden, who is one\nof the best bike handlers in the biz\nhere in North America. And the two of\nthose dudes not only dropped everybody\nin the pro group, but passed the lead\nmoto on the first descent.\n&gt;&gt; And yeah, doing so on slicks. Just easy\npeasy.\n&gt;&gt; Well, I I I that's not me. I I do like\nuh like middle slick tread for a lot of\ntime, especially if I know where I'm\nriding. Like a lot of boulders dirt\nroads are exactly that. They're dirt\nroads. But if I'm squealing down rough,\nloose, sandy, unbeknownst to me trails,\na little bite up front, I'm with you.\nAiring on the side of a little stance\nand a little bite is the way to go.\n&gt;&gt; What do you think of these? Did you want\nmore tire, less tire? Did you feel like\nit was just right? What would you have\nchanged tirewise on your setup today?\nProbably just a little bigger in the\nfront. Maybe a little lower pressure.\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; Uh it was pretty rattly in parts.\n&gt;&gt; Especially towards the end of the day as\nyou're like getting fatigued. And\n&gt;&gt; what was your tire pressure? You ran\nfront and rear. Do you remember?\n&gt;&gt; Uh 25 26. And I'm like a buck 85 and\nwith you know 20 lbs of bike and 2\nliters of water. This is what the Silka\ntire calculator said for like the\ncobblestone setting. Like yeah there's\ncobblestones here and\n&gt;&gt; perfect. That's exactly what this is. Do\nit.\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\nI really enjoyed the variety of the\ntopography and the scenery. Like the\nscenery is just absurd. We're in the\neastern Sierra. Yose is just north of\nhere. Yeah, we start at what 8,500 ft.\n&gt;&gt; 8,500 ft right now.\n&gt;&gt; And then the the course I did descends\ndown to almost 5,000 ft and coming up\nthrough Chadago Canyon. Looks like Mars\nwith the\n&gt;&gt; super cool red rock canyon area. How'd\nyou feel about the gearing on the bike?\nWas it adequate?\n&gt;&gt; Uh, you know, I'm actually a fan of a\nlarger front chain ring.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So, with the Explore Group, of course,\nthat's kind of where you make the big\nchanges because you only have a 1046 or\na 1046.\n&gt;&gt; So, you I usually like to run a 42 or a\n44. I felt like today I struggled a\nlittle bit on the descents because I was\njust out of gears. Yes.\n&gt;&gt; So, I would have liked something a\nlittle bit bigger. That being said, we\nmay be sitting here having a different\nconversation. If I had gone with a 44, I\nmay say, \"Hey, I actually would wish I\nhad a 40 or 42.\" So, I felt like it was\nokay for the day, but if I had to come\nback and I could tweak equipment, yeah,\nI'd probably go with like a 42, maybe a\n44 just because some of these hills are\njust rolling hills and you really want\nto go fast and get into like a decent\nrhythm. How about you?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean, like with the Dogma GR,\nthis comes stock with a 40 and the one\nchoice you can have the 1046. And I was\nout of rope on both ends at different\npoints of the day. Our neutral descent,\nneutral descent, we were over 50 mph.\nNot that you were pedaling there, but um\nsome people with doubles could pedal and\nI was just using my\n&gt;&gt; my natural resources to stay with the\ngroup there. And then at points in the\nday when it was, you know, double digit\nclimbs, you know, there I remembered a\ncouple times like coming up through\nChiago Canyon looking down, I'm seeing\nI'm well over threshold at like, you\nknow, 60 RPM and keep pressing the left\nlever looking for more and more.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. So like a mullet would have been\nnice in a couple spots. So, like a lot\nof bike racers, you give me anything and\nI can find something to complain about.\nLike, if it was a mullet, I'd be like,\n\"Oh, the jumps are too big.\" And now\nthis one's got nice small jumps, but I\ncould have used a little bit more\ngearing. But\n&gt;&gt; I hear you.\n&gt;&gt; That's all part of the deal. I, you\nknow, was able to stay on the bike and\nwas not forced off the bike by the\ngearing. I was forced off the bike by a\nlack of nerves at one point. We had a\nsuper loose this palm of stone sand you\nwere talking about and at an angle and\nthe bike was doing this and I just\nstarted squealing and got to the point\nwhere I'm like you know I'm just going\nto walk and climbed off the bike and\npeople are like zooming past me and I'm\nlike I'm just walking like Delaney are\nyou okay? I'm like yes I'm just scared\nand then yeah got back on and surf\nthrough the sand for like a mile or so.\nSo front end Gio in my head I was\nthinking would a super slacked out\nmountain bike like ride give me the\nconfidence to stay on the bike there. I\ndon't know like probably not but um it\nis interesting to see like this guy is\nlike 71 like depending on the size it's\nlike 71.75\nor so for the effectively size 57. Um a\nlittle steeper than this guy if I'm\nreading the charts correctly.\n&gt;&gt; How did you feel about the front end\nhandling?\n&gt;&gt; I actually thought it was pretty good.\nUh, I felt like it sometimes it was a a\nlittle bit tall in the front. I wish it\nwas maybe a little bit shorter. And\nmaybe that's just me adjusting my fit,\nremoving some of these spacers, but\n&gt;&gt; I never felt like I was,\n&gt;&gt; you know, out of control on any\nsections. I felt like it handled really\nwell. I felt like the front end was\nnever swirly. And I found that I\nactually appreciated it when we were in\nsome of these rolling hills and even the\nflat pavement sections. And on the\nclimbs, of course, it just Yeah, it felt\nfantastic.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. What are you packing, man? What do\nyou got in your uh\n&gt;&gt; Want to see?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. What what you got in your down\ntube there?\n&gt;&gt; Well, let me show you. See, this is one\nof my favorite things about the Dogma GR\nis, you know, most down tube stoages are\nlike, you know, just this big, right?\n&gt;&gt; We not the Doma GR. Hang tight.\nThis\n&gt;&gt; drum roll\n&gt;&gt; on camera here.\n&gt;&gt; Birthday balloon in there,\n&gt;&gt; right? I mean, what is this? This is\nlike a foot long sub.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, what what are you packing in\n&gt;&gt; Well, funny.\n&gt;&gt; Just like the stock stuff.\n&gt;&gt; Stock stuff. I've got a pump in here. I\ndidn't have to use it. I've got some\nCO2. Got a tube in here.\n&gt;&gt; I've got uh some tire levers. I've got\neverything that I need. And I'd say\nthere's probably still another 4 to 6 in\nof storage in the down tube. So, if I\nneeded to shed a layer or something, I\ncould have just thrown it in there,\nwhich\n&gt;&gt; really impressive. I love that about it.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. I'm often running cameras\nfront and rear like I had a camera on\ntoday. So, I definitely appreciated\nhaving the flat fixings in there. When\nwe did a shakeout ride the other day\nthrough Chago Canyon, I had this packed\ntoo tight and this thing popped off. And\nI was appreciative of the fact that\nthere's a little boingy string on there\nso it didn't drop the thing and then\njust got it configured so it did not pop\nout. So that's that's why we do shake\nour rides, especially when we're\nchanging bikes all the time.\n&gt;&gt; Totally cramming stuff in there and\ngoing out. It's better to have that\nhappen uh the day before the race or a\ncouple days before the race. I also\nappreciate the positioning and that I\ncan have my Hugs Manila Mango Shake, you\nknow, held securely there and still open\nthis. So, in addition to being able to\naccess this while keeping your water\nbottle there, it's also good, I think,\nstructurally and that a lot of bikes\nhave the cage mounted on the the door.\nAnd so, means like one of two things.\nOne, like they have to\n&gt;&gt; effectively like overbuild this so it's\nsuper heavy but secure for the cage. or\nthis is like a little floppy because\nyou've got so much weight on there. So,\n&gt;&gt; did you ever find that you felt the\nreach was a little bit too long to get\nto or did you feel like it was just in\nthe right spot?\n&gt;&gt; The reach for the cages?\n&gt;&gt; Reach for the bottles?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they're low for sure. Um, and I'm\nglad you asked. I just carried this\nbottle around with me all day. Did not\ntake a sip of it. I had my Castelli\njersey on that has a bladder in there, 2\nliters. So,\n&gt;&gt; went through that, stopped at one of the\naid stations way out there. kind\ngentleman helped me refill and get it\nback in which is always the challenge.\nUm so drank four liters but did not\ntouch this at all. I do like how they\nsit low uh aside from the fact that it's\nyou know aerodynamically more efficient\nto be lower near the bottom bracket just\nbecause you can run a frame bag and\nyou're tall boy. So it's like a cake and\neat it too thing.\n&gt;&gt; I did not bring my cake though. Well,\nI've got like I don't know how many\nframe bags at home and since I was\nwearing all kinds of layers like I had\nmy Castelli Perfetto on and knee warmers\nand gloves and even had a headband like\nI was, you know, very cozy at the start\nbecause\n&gt;&gt; yeah, we were going 50 miles an hour\ndownhill. It was like 40 degrees at the\nstart. I like to be warm. So, I had all\nthis stuff and then a couple hours in it\nwas, you know, 65 degrees and\n&gt;&gt; I should have brought a frame bag to put\nmy stuff in. Um, one thing I appreciate\nabout this race, Amanda Nelman and David\nChic, who run this do a fantastic job in\nso many ways.\n&gt;&gt; Agreed.\n&gt;&gt; Uh, having Drop Bags is one of the many\nways they've just got it down. They're\nraces themselves. Amanda won Unbound\nback in the day, Gravel Hall of Famer\nnow. Um, and they think about the\ndetails. So, whereas I don't think about\nthe details. So, being able to like drop\na bunch of stuff in a buddy's drop bag,\nthanks Scott, at the aid station where\nwe filled up was a nice thing. But I\nlike that this comes with rivets so you\ncan have a nice tidy frame bag without\nvelcro cuz like I've I'm kind of a wide\ndude, you know? I'm like thick in the\nlegs and thicken the back end and like\nthicken the head. So when I've got\nvelcro here, it's like pulls on the\nshorts. I don't like that. So having\nbags that are attached by bolts, nice\nthing. Just have to be smarter than the\nbolts and bring the bag with you.\n&gt;&gt; That's actually something you have that\nI don't I don't have that bolt right\nhere.\n&gt;&gt; Mhm. You can bolt on fenders though.\nThat That's\n&gt;&gt; I saw that. Yeah. So, I can bolt on a\nrear fender here.\n&gt;&gt; In the event that that's what you want\nto do with your Dogma GR.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Seems like, you know, close to\nMesa. Have you ever Do you own fenders?\n&gt;&gt; I do not.\n&gt;&gt; No, I don't.\n&gt;&gt; No. But if it's raining, I'm going to be\non the trainer.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. For those two days out of the\nyear. Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right. Yeah. For the two\ndays. Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; What would you like to change if you\nwere to come back with either of these\nbikes? What would you do differently?\n&gt;&gt; Okay. So, if I were to bring this bike\nback, I think I would number one make\nthese a little more narrow. So, I wish\nthat these were like a 40 or a 42.\n&gt;&gt; I like a little more narrow bar.\n&gt;&gt; I'd probably again change front chain\nring. I'd go to a 42 just to try it. I\ndon't think I'd go all the way to a 44.\nSaddle was great. I felt like everything\nwas dialed in pretty well. I think my\none gripe would be tire clearance.\n&gt;&gt; If I could fit 50s on here, I think it\nwould be great for Mammoth Tough. But,\nof course, 4545 was sufficient. I felt\nlike it was plenty fast. But if Chris\ncould design a bike could maybe kind of\ntweak a couple things, I'd go 50 front\nand rear and I think it would be\n&gt;&gt; Okay, for the price, I feel like the the\nbike should come with a power meter. I\nuse the Fava AIMO power meter pedals,\nwhich I like quite a bit. Saw Garmin\njust came out with a new version of the\nrally pedals, which I did not like the\nold ones, so hopefully they've improved\nthey've improved those. Um, using the\nShimano Sfire gravel shoes, which I\nlove, have pontoons to just really have\na firm pedal platform. You got to push\ndown a little harder to clip in with\nthese because the body is just like a\nscooch taller than Shimano pedals. Was\ntalking to Justin from Shimano uh during\nthe ride and he said his recommendation\nwas just to loosen the pedals a couple\nclicks. Got it.\n&gt;&gt; So it's like the nice sweet spot. But\n&gt;&gt; my preference would be an integrated\npower meter. Like let the pedals do\ntheir thing\n&gt;&gt; be pedals and then let a power meter be\na power meter. And Shramm makes great\npower meters with cork. So, that is one\nthing I would like to see on a bike of\nthis caliber in price is a cork meter.\n&gt;&gt; Especially this one being the higherend\ntop-of-the-line bike. I thought for sure\nthere'd be a power meter on here. So, I\nwas a little surprised to see that.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you're going to be taking this\nbike home from here.\n&gt;&gt; Saving me the hassle of breaking it\ndown, putting in the bike box. Thanks\nfor\n&gt;&gt; So, yeah, you'll be able to taste test\nthis with more tire clearance. So, be\ncurious to hear your thoughts on that.\n&gt;&gt; Excited.\n&gt;&gt; If you want to hear his thoughts on this\none, follow the guy if you're not\nalready doing so. Outdoor Bros. I'll put\na link in the video description below.\n&gt;&gt; Thanks.\n&gt;&gt; Great spending time with you. Great ride\nwith you. Thanks for helping out and\n&gt;&gt; you're the man.\n&gt;&gt; Making this video a lot more fun\n&gt;&gt; for sure.\n&gt;&gt; Hope this was helpful. Let me know what\nquestions you have for me and for Chris.\nWe'll do our best to answer and whether\nyou prefer the Dogma GR, the Grareville\nF, or something else. Just get out there\nand enjoy the ride.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, Ben, I do have another question\nfor you. What is going on in this front\nbottle cage?\n&gt;&gt; Hydration's important. By this you mean\nmy my milkshake?\n&gt;&gt; I love myself a milkshake after an\nevent. So we beline to Hugs in the\nvillage here. Got a Manila mango.\n&gt;&gt; Thanks Hugs for sponsoring this video.\n&gt;&gt; Should get a milkshake sponsor.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's exactly what we need.\n&gt;&gt; That's a great idea.\n&gt;&gt; I mean, how funny would that be if you\nhad just like milkshakes at the end of\nevery thing and it was just like a\n&gt;&gt; milkshake product placement?\n&gt;&gt; Oh man,\n&gt;&gt; I should do that. That is great."

      "transcript": "well good evening granny gear here for\nold guy in a bike a little bit ago I did\na tough gravel bike ride how do I know\nit was tough well the name of it it was\nthe mammoth tough that's spelled t u FF\nthe way tough is always spelled and this\nis a story 40 miles a gravel\nhell oh man\nhow' the Cowboys do\n[Music]\nthat all right just kidding about the 40\nmil of Hell part sound pretty cool\nthough huh but I'm not kidding about the\nmammoth tough it is a gravel event held\nup in the town of Mammoth Lakes\nCalifornia which is in the eastern\nsieras along that Highway 395 Corridor\nit is a destination town both for winter\nfor skiing and snowboarding and who\nknows what else in the summer they have\nthe mountain bike park and uh just\nfishing and hiking and you know it's a\nentrance area to The Back Country to\nwildernesses for people that are doing\novernight bike uh backpacking anyway\nyeah it's a place it's a place to be\nvery nice young couple Named Dave and\nAmanda they put on this gravel event\nthey do a 40 mile a 70 mile and a 90\nmile now I'd signed up for the 70\nbecause I figured that'd be hard enough\nwithout being stupidly hard for this old\nguy\nhowever my friends kind of wanted to do\nthe 40 and I thought you know what I\nthink the 40 sounds like a really good\nidea I'd get back while the tacos were\nstill hot Etc more on that later let's\nroll the video let me show you the\nsights and the sounds of the 40 mile\nversion of the mammoth tough be right\nback\nso 15 minutes 15 minutes to the 820\nstart down\n5 4 3 2 1 go\nhe\nwoo man was there some soft spots in\nthat had to stop and clothes I am glad I\nuh had a GPS because I would have never\nfound my way out of there holy smokes oh\nthere's all my buddies we're all here\nteam orange is team orange is changing\nclothes I wish I hadn't worn knickers\ncuz it's warmer than I thought but hey\nwhat are you going to do what a\nbeautiful day though huh look at\nthis wow see all the Riders out there\nall right we got more to go\nspe\nwas that old country song God Bless the\nBroken Road that was a broken road you\ncouldn't probably tell on camera but it\nwas like asphalt and then there'd be\nlike sand pits you drop off the asphalt\ninto the sand and the rocks and up The\nLedges and it's like good fun huh it's\nlike old it's like old mountain biking\ndays without\nsuspension all right we're waiting for\nour our two friends and then we're going\nto continue on down we're still going\ndownhill I think we go downhill for a\nlong ways but we're paying the pipe cuz\nall that all that\npmus man you're pedaling going downhill\nso we're working all right beautiful day\nthough beautiful day\nsnack\nbreak is that pretty I think this road\ngoes on forever\ngood\nstuff thank goodness for suspension seat\npost\nlook at all the yummy things Pop-Tarts\nNutter\nButters how do\nHaribo Gummy Bears a Gummy Bears Gummy\nBears chimato doing a great job for\neverybody it's going to have some issues\nvery very nice very very well-run sag\nlovely yummy things to eat okay I'm\nloaded up with drinks my friend friends\nare ready friends friends say they're\nready we're leaving see you down the\nroad\noh oh back on smooth pavement now woo\nthat's a relief we're heading to Highway\n395 you can see it there and then\nwe make a right turn and you can see\nMammoth Mountain over there with all the\nski trails on it that's the general\ndirection we're heading and if\nexperience is anything seems like\nthere's always a headwind once we make a\nright turn on the 395 been a great ride\nthough uh if there was ever a ride that\nyou wanted big tires on your gravel bike\nit was that one we'll be talking about\nhow I had the bike set up I got a pedal\npedal pedal little granny gear and get\nmy myself up the road here talk to you\nguys in a little\nbit well that was some unexpected\nsuckage I guess I was wrong about what\nthe route did I thought it was road all\nthe way up it\nwasn't it wasn't and that was some\nSandy\nslow climbs we got to be that was pretty\nmiserable right yeah I agree that was uh\nif you got to come up that after doing\nthe 70 or the 90 yeah yeah yeah yeah got\nto be some anger issues some anger\nissues I was thinking to myself oh I'm\nglad I didn't do the 70 and had to ride\nthat all right uh Journey on we got to\nbe I see a guy going into a little more\ndirt Trail up there maybe so I don't\nknow I'm not sure we'll survive all\nright off off we go\nwell all righty then didn't that look\ninviting I tell you what I had you know\nthe week before I did the mammoth tough\n40 Mi right the week before that I did a\n70m gravel bike event which was not\nparticularly\nchallenging but you know what the 40 mil\nof the mammoth tough that was actually\nharder than the 70 mil of the lass and\ngravel Adventure Race miles are not\nequal guys and you know that especially\nif you're a mountain biker like I am\nbecause sometimes you know one mile can\ntake you a long long time to cover but\nthe biggest challenge in Mammoth is\nreally well two things really elevation\nthe town sits at I think around 8,000 ft\nand you kind of go up from there most of\nthe time and uh there was a lot of\ndescending in this ride at the first I\ndon't know gee the first 20 miles mostly\nfelt downhill however pmus this is a\nvolcanic area Mammoth is all volcanic so\nyou get you get this I'm I'm going to\npick up a handful of sand and gravel\nright you can see this well if you can\nimagine that over most of the roads that\nhave been beat down all summer by uh you\nknow the side by sides and jeeps and\nmotorcycles and who knows what that pmus\nsometimes was over your rims deep so\neven though you're going downhill you're\njust putting out quite a bit of watts to\nPedal anyway it was a great event um I\ndid find the route finding uh slightly\nchallenging because there were some\nplaces where they just were no course\nmarkers in the trees where you kind of\nwant to have some kind of course marking\nso um unless that changes make sure you\neither know the area you ride with\nsomebody who knows the area or you know\nlike I did I had my Wahoo GPS and that\nwas actually just fine after the event\nhung around the Expo for a little bit\nhobnob with my fellow Wizards and uh\ngenerally just Bast in the glow of my\nfriendship with three other people I\nrode this with that I've known for years\nand years and I think it's an event I'll\nprobably back uh be back to now beyond\nthat beyond the gravel event Mrs granny\ngear and I and our cute little dog we\ndecide we'd stay up there for a few days\nso if you're going to visit this area\nhere's a few things to know obviously\nyou want to bring some bikes um it's F\nthere are some familyfriendly bike paths\nuh one of them that goes up from the\ntown of Mammoth up into the um Lake Mary\nHorseshoe Lake area and it's a very very\nwellestablished really nice little bike\npass system not too long it's kind of\nhilly though so if you've got some\nyoungans or somebody that isn't in shape\nat that altitude it is it is\nsurprisingly daunting but you can get it\ndone if you're if you're fit or you got\nsome ebikes and you're used that kind of\nstuff you're going to enjoy that we also\ndid some hiking we got out and we hiked\naround Convict Lake and we hiked around\nHorseshoe Lake and we went and we drove\nup to lining which is about 15 miles 20\nmiles north or less of Mammoth along the\n395 we went to uh Ino cone and got\nourselves a nice soft serve cone and\nthen went looked over Mono Lake The\nVisitor Center there and that you can\nget down to the Shoreline Etc quite an\ninteresting area to visit drove the June\nLake Loop uh went out had some nice\nmeals and some nice restaurants and uh\njust generally enjoyed ourselves very\nvery much up in Mammoth there's a lot to\ndo up there I'm a fisherman I wasn't\nprepared for that but I saw a whole\nbunch of people out there with fishing\nrods and that was pretty cool so check\nout Mammoth Lake is a destination if\nyou're coming somewhere with yourself or\na friend or your significant other or\nyour whole family there was a lot to do\nin the mammoth lakes area and that whole\n39 5 Corridor you know from Lone Pine\nall the way up to IND um to Bridgeport\nand that whole area there's bod Ghost\nTown there's a lot to do up there guys\nit is super super fun one thing to\nremember though I don't think it's\nMammoth has the best gravel biking uh\nmountain biking sure if I had a mountain\nbike and a gravel bike I would bring my\nmountain bike to Mammoth just because of\nthe pmus very very soft soils that is\nkind of the way it is up there and uh\nthat ain't going to change anytime soon\nso if you're going to bring a gravel\nbike I suggest you pack a big tire now\nfor this event I used my Turner cyclosis\nof course I was\npacking um some 50 mm WTB\nresolutesupportmedia that's about it for\nnow you guys I hope you enjoy a little\nlook at the mammoth tough and as always\nyou guys have a great week Endor weekend\nyou know you go ride your bikes huh"

      "description": "Back for my second year taking on the Mammoth TUFF. This is a 40+ mile gravel race in the heart of Mammoth Lakes California. \n\nAgain this year I camped waking up in 35\u00b0 weather, pretending I\u2019m smoking cigarettes with the warm air exiting my lungs while I wait for my coffee to brew. This year I was joined by my wife and daughter which was an absolute blast seeing them waving my CaliDOMESTIQUE flag for me at the finish line. It was that extra little encouragement that I needed to keep going. \n\nOur first evening, a bear visited our campsite exchanging all my friend\u2019s meat in his cooler for paw prints. After we got warm and started moving, we jumped in the truck to explore June Lake and then over to the village for packet pickup. \n\nThe morning of race day, I struggled to get up in the cold, and what was even more terrifying was trying to slide into ice cold cycling gear. We left our campsite at 7:40am for the 8:20am start time. \n\nThere was a controlled pace and vehicle lead out until we turned off the main road and headed for dirt. We were immediately welcomed with a grade that only seemed to garner more elevation. Once we crested the first climb of the day, we had a chunky fast descent. Me being me, I was trying to be super quiet at camp and closed the car door on my thumb. It immediately bruised up and was throbbing. The vibrations coming from the downhill was not helping my thumb. My right hand went numb and I could feel my heart beat in my thumb. But I kept going. This is where I lost a bit of time, but made it up on the flats. \n\nAny other course, the crushed gravel roads would be mundane, but any direction you look, you\u2019re blessed with mountain formations anywhere you look. \n\nThe last part of the section last year had a deep sandy area where it took a miracle not to come to a stop and walk your bike. This year, it was replaced with some fun single track before putting you back in the final road climb back to the Village. \n\nFrom the campsite to the village we knew what incline was awaiting us as we tackled the climb once again for the final time of the day. Once I made that final right turn towards the finish line, I immediately saw my daughter waving my flag. I almost didn\u2019t even notice the flag because I was drawn to the biggest smile on her face. \n\nAfter we redeemed our meal and drink ticket, we rode back to camp and jumped into the jacuzzi for some much needed R&R. We had another lunch and then headed back to the village for some Mammoth Brewery IPA at GOMEZ Mexican restaurant in the heart of the village. \n\nSunday came way too soon, and it was time to pack up and head home. We stopped in Bishop for some baked goods, and then caffeine in Line Pine before making our 4 hour drive back home. \n\nThanks to everyone who supported me for this video and I can\u2019t wait for the next one. \n\nBRL Sports Nutrition $10 off\nhttps://brlsports.com/CALIDOMESTIQUE\n\nTifosi Optics\nhttps://amzn.to/46CruUR\n\nWhoop 30 days FREE\njoin.whoop.com/CaliDOMESTIQUE\n\nKetone IQ\nhttps://amzn.to/4mo5Vfv\n\nSaris MHS Bike Rack\nhttps://amzn.to/4mgF0lC\n\nRedshift Sports 15% off\nCode \u201cCaliDOMESTIQUE\u201d\n\nH2O Audio 10% off\nhttps://h2oaudio.com/CALIDOMESTIQUE\n\nPickle Juice Company \nhttps://amzn.to/4mjjMnc\n\nFOLLOW ME:\nhttp://instagram.com/calidomestique\nhttp://facebook.com/CaliDomestique\nhttp://twitter.com/calidomestique\nhttp://strava.com/clubs/calidomestique\n\nSUBSCRIBE HERE: \nhttps://youtube.com/@calidomestique\n\nCollaborations?

      "transcript": "What's going on everyone? Shane from\nKelly Domestique and this is the long\nawaited race documentary video. We are\nloaded up. I just got to get the bikes\non, but we are headed up to Mammoth. We\nare doing the Mammoth Tough on Saturday,\nSeptember 13th. We're going to be\ncamping. We got the rooftop tent. We've\ngot three bikes we're bringing. We've\ngot ebikes so little one can explore the\nvillage and not complain about being\ntired. But we are ready to go. So, let's\nget these bikes loaded on and hit the\nroad. We'll see you guys in the car.\nWe are headed out with the team/f family\non the way to Mammoth, California.\nSo, we don't have video of us last night\narriving because it was about 10:00 and\nwe had to set up the tent. We got the\nbikes up. We set our changing tent up.\nOur friend was already here. He had a\nfire going. And this is our camp setup.\nWe've got a changing tent so we don't\nhave to go up under the rooftop. We've\ngot We're charging this for tonight.\nWe've got our kitchen setup, hammocks,\nbikes. There's a little one on the bike.\nWave K. Actually, hold two hands.\nShe's already exploring the RV campsite\non her electric bike. We also brought\nher mountain bike, so we're going to\nexplore the trails today. Today is going\nto be a relaxing day up at June Lake.\nHave some lunch, go to the village, do\nour packet pickup, but we've got\neverything ready to go. We did hit a\nbunch of downpour about 20 minutes south\nof Mammoth. Uh so I don't have to clean\nthe bikes now, which is great. But now\nwe are going to go explore, head over,\nsee the indoor ingground pool at the\ncampsite, go to Starbucks, and then\nwe'll be on the road to explore some of\nwhat Mammoth has to offer. So relaxing\nday. Let's go.\n&gt;&gt; A bear visit us to today. Last night.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, if you didn't hear, one of the\ncoolers was left out and there was bare\nprints. It was able to open it up and\nall the meat was taken from our friend's\ncooler. So, now we got to go get some\nmore meat.\n&gt;&gt; We will be back.\n&gt;&gt; Friday Mammoth tough shakeout ride. Got\nJonathan K and Jen.\nWe are now downtown in the village for\nthe Mammoth Buff. This is a onemile beer\nrun. You run around the village uh\ntotaling a mile and you chug a beer\nevery time you come around a lap.\n&gt;&gt; Number 90 and number 122 in the lead\nfollowed by 110 and 123. The Canadian\nNational Triathlon Champion right there.\n&gt;&gt; All right, this is going to go on your\nhandlebars.\n&gt;&gt; Uh don't wrap it around your head too.\nYou'll need three to size.\nI feel like we keep meeting like this.\nUm, early morning, it's about 6:30 a.m.\nSaturday morning, race day. 35\u00b0\nFahrenheit, boiling water for the\ncoffee, getting some oatmeal, and then\nwe're going to\ntry to put some freezing cold bibs and\njerseys on, and we're going to ride to\nthe start line. So, let me get this\ncoffee made, and uh, I'll be right back.\nGot my coffee. Making a fire for\neveryone staying at camp. and\ngot my thumb slammed in the door. So,\nwe'll see how I do with injury. It's not\ntoo bad, but it's going to she's going\nto fall off.\nLet's get the kid on. So, here we are at\nthe start line. We've got Jonathan,\nmyself, and David. The tough course,\nwhich was 40 mi long, had a bunch of\nparticipants. Uh, it was warm in the\nsun, but chilly in the shade. And we are\nready to get our wheels spinning.\n&gt;&gt; One, go. There we go, ladies and\ngentlemen. Our 41.45\nmile approach. The tub underway right\nnow. All three of our distances are now\nout on course.\n[Music]\n&gt;&gt; It was a neutral start. I ended up\ntaking the music out of the background\njust so I didn't get any copyright\nstrikes. It was let out down through the\nvillage. We made a left and then I\nbelieve that was 395\nand then we headed left into the dirt.\nAt the end of the pavement is where we\nfound our first taste of gravel.\nWe were lucky enough to keep our speed\nfrom the pavement, but this was an\nincline and it kept going up up.\nDemetri,\n&gt;&gt; I'm using my Brighton S810 for my\nnavigation. I preloaded the route onto\nthis. It was super simple. It was just\nuploading my saved route and turn by\nturn it nailed every single fork in the\nroad. You name it, no issues. I never\nhad to recalculate once. I just followed\nthe onscreen navigation and it got me\nfrom start to finish. This is kind of\nwhere my bruised thumb took a beating.\nIt uh was throbbing. Even though I have\nthe suspension stem on the front from\nRed Shift Sports, this was a killer. My\nright hand went numb immediately. But\nthen we were blessed with this nice,\nbeautiful sunrise scene.\nAll\nright, Jonathan and I are at our first\nuh aid station. It's super chunky. Um\nJonathan beat me here. I've got my boooo\nfinger went numb. So, we're about what,\nhalfway done?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Halfway.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. We're right at 20 miles.\n&gt;&gt; I think an hour and 20 minutes in.\nHalfway. So, uh we'll keep riding.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. If you want to go, just go. I'm uh\n&gt;&gt; I feel like I'm making some good time,\nthough.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. I just I got past a lot, but I was\nlike enjoying the view, enjoying the\nride.\nThere we go.\nStart climbing.\nguys.\n[Applause]\nHeat.\nWell, we're on paved road. There's going\nto be a hill soon. So, what better time\nto thank my sponsors for this video with\ntheir help and support. First of all, we\nhave SARS with their MHS three bike\nrack. So, we could bring bikes up here\nfor the whole family. We've got Whoop.\nWe've got two-year support. We've got\nBRL Sports Nutrition. Check them out.\nThey're in my bottles. Everything\nleading up to the race I used. We have\nGula Composites for my carbon wheels.\nWe've got Tosi for my optics, Sweet\nProtection for my helmet, Pickle Juice,\nrecently became an ambassador for them.\nUm,\nI can't think right now. We're almost\ndone, but I'll have a uh a rolling list\nof everyone who's uh helped with this\nvideo. And next up is the uh finish\nline. Let's go.\n&gt;&gt; That was a great color for a bike.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, I know. I've only ever seen one\nother one.\n&gt;&gt; And it was here in May last year.\n&gt;&gt; What?\n&gt;&gt; It was here in May with last year. And\nI've never seen this color anywhere\nelse.\n&gt;&gt; Wow. They made it for like I don't even\nknow six months.\n&gt;&gt; That's a big frame.\n&gt;&gt; Extra large.\nThis was a pleasant surprise from last\nyear. Once we passed the baseball\nfields, we were blessed with some\nawesome single track.\nThe most grueling part of the day has to\nbe hands down the paved climb back to\nthe start/ finish line.\nAll right, come out to the bench.\nWow.\nMy daughter and number one fan holding\nmy calom mystique flag at the finish.\nWelcome to Shane York. And then 449 up 3\nhours 33 minute and 3 seconds.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so another Mammoth Tough in\nthe books. We're all packed up from our\ncampsite. Some of the sponsors that I\nforgot to mention when I was digging\ndeep on the course was Red Shift Sports.\nWe had Ketone IQ and H2O audio. They\nkept me going. I used their built-in\nplaylist on my headphones so I didn't\nhave to use any power on my phone just\nin case I needed that emergency, but uh\n12th for my age. Uh had a great time.\nThe course was a mile longer this year\nand I was a minute faster. So all in\nall, good timing and uh we've inspired\nthe next generation of riders. This one\nwants to come back and do the 40 next\nyear. Till the next video, we'll see you\nguys later.\nIs that cool?"
