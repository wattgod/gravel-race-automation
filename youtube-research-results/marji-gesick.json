      "description": "A brutal race, even at 50 miles. Just over 7,000 ft of climbing. This race starts in Marquette MI and ends in Ishpeming. Surprised myself with a top 50% finish and a lot less pain than the last two years. \n\nPoke around or watch the whole thing! I might make a summary video, but I hope this video lets you see the parts of marji you are most interested in.\n\nThis race tests you, as a result there are a couple F bombs and such in here. Not a good year for pedals and cleats as they seemed to seize into the pedals making it all but impossible to get off. Video doesn't contain roughly 40 minutes of stopping. But ALLL of the riding is otherwise here. The final 15 miles are historically known as basically insane. They seemed to have tamed them down a bit this year with some new singletrack and less hike-a-bike (grateful), but tough regardless. Miles 19-40 seemed more difficult to me, but no section of this race should be underestimated. The race has always had some sections changed to fine tune the masochism level, but this is a good representation of what to expect. The video just simply doesn't portray how steep the climbing is. Lots of granny gear and almost max effort involved. Steep climbs in succession are the name of the game here.\n\nMy strategy for this race is to recover whenever possible. Sure, i could go faster in the easy parts, but i'd rather stay on my bike for the climbs as much as possible. I suck at pushing a bike and it's more gratifying for me to make the climbs then possibly finish a little quicker with a bunch of walking (if that's possible?). Strategy worked well for me this year.",

      "transcript": "welcome to discovering it's brutal its\npunishing and it's uphill all the way\nthe Marja gesek is known as one of the\nmost challenging endurance bike races in\nthe midwest and it's right here in the u\np it's a lot of suffering but it's\nextremely rewarding to ride my bike all\nday and enjoy the Marquette County\nsingle track stick around it's Monday\nnight and time for discovering the\nsecrets trees that flow beneath the\ncliffs colored stone forest again\nwith birch and pine\nsurrounded by the greatest lakes in this\nworld as ever\nbears awesome presents as he roams the\nhills and fields\ncall of the Timberwolf\ndon't rub the eagle soaring high above\nthe trowel lies deep and still\nthese are what I treasure the only way I\nmeasured feelings that I have for the\nspine\nthere is so much to discover when your\nlongtime lover\nnorthern Michigan\n[Music]\nthe race started in 2015\nDanny and I just I think we came\ntogether and we wanted to put together\nan event that I did a couple of things\nwe wanted to feature Marquette County\nyou know all of the trails that it has\nit started we had a very successful snow\nbike race called the polar roll the\nfirst year and we're having coffee in\nthe spring he said you know what are we\ngonna do for the summertime and I've had\nthis vision in my mind for a long time\nof this 100-mile race linking all the\ntrails in Marquette County together to\nmake a hundred mile race and I said I\ngot it let's do it and it kind of\nstarted from there we wanted to put\ntogether an event for the community and\nfor those in the Midwest and even\noutside the Midwest that would really\ntest one spirit one's will and their\nability to push through a difficult\nevent they said you're not gonna get 12\nmaybe 15 people to show up for something\nlike that on these trails now we have\n650 people signed up for this weekend\nsome say it's the most grueling bike\nrace in the Midwest I've probably bitten\noff more than I can chew but we'll find\nout some soon the entire country\nI'm from Somerset Wisconsin in the\nbeautiful st. Croix River Valley I'm\nexpecting to be on my bike longer than\nI've ever ridden my mountain bike I've\ndone a lot of long road stuff but this\nis the first time I'm on a mountain bike\nfor this amount of time moved a little\nbit yesterday and got a chance to see if\nwhatever kind of up against and I'm\nexcited about it I'm just gonna try to\nkeep it cool and pace myself and try to\nget a belt buckle 100 miles of\nbone-jarring skin ripping brutal\nunforgiving mining country trails that\nzigzag through the rugged goopy\nlandscape from Marquette to Ishpeming\nyeah I'm up here from the madison\nwisconsin area here to enjoy the trails\nand hopefully finish in under 12 hours\nbut we'll see how that goes\ntwelve thousand feet of overall ascent\nthis is my first year from what I've\nheard it's gonna be rocky and rough and\npretty brutal\nso it'll challenge me sure my name is\nDavid libel I live in noosing Michigan\nthis will be my third year doing the\nMarkey jessic we're really excited to be\ninvolved with the event once again it's\na lot of suffering but it's extremely\nrewarding to get out ride my bike all\nsingle track it's something I've been\ndoing for a long time and I'm really\npassionate about it\nthis event you know I was really awesome\nfor supporting the local trails and I'm\nreally excited to be a part of it it's a\nchallenge that will test even the most\nconditioned endurance athletes like\nwe're gonna crush it and show Danny and\nTodd what's going on and then about\nseven eight hours and I will be crying\nthat's how it goes right from around the\ncountry they come for a chance to win a\ncoveted bucket the course is primarily\nsingle track throughout all of Marquette\nCounty there's a lot of climbing so this\nrace is famous for the 12,000 feet of\nclimbing so there's a lot a lot of hiker\nbike especially towards the end as we\nget into issuing later tonight\nthey'll be challenging for sure to come\nto test themselves put their skills and\ndetermination on the pedals of a bike\nand see if they can make it to the top\nof the moment if it's only if as I say\nit is become with one goal just to\nfinish\none thing that's neat is that we employ\nwhat's called LeMans start for bikers\nthat means they have to run for a\nhalf-mile\n[Applause]\nloop's out of the forest they'll ski\ntrails now back to where 400 bikes are\nstaged in this open field hopefully they\nremember with their bikers and as they\nrun back into the field they find their\nbike they hop on it and they shoot out\ninto the actual fight start shooting in\ntheir pocket run\nthe trail links three I would say our\nunique areas of Marquette County the\nhunter mile race starts out in the\nHarlow Lake area that's north Marquette\nthe natural feel of that trail the the\nage of that trail you can just tell when\nyou're riding out there that's that's\nbeen there a long time built by hand\nit's a very unique experience come\nthrough the Harlow Lake area which\neventually ties in to the North trails\nat the NTN single track committee put\nbuilds in Marquette that eventually\nconnects us into the South trails also\nbuilt by the NTN and we go all through\nthe South trails and we shoot racers\nwest up into new Gani initially mean\ninto a trail system I think we've had 40\nto 45 miles up here in the race that is\nbuilt by Ramba which is the range area\nmountain bike Association the Harlow\nstuff is really unique and it's old its\nrocky it's Rudy some really fantastic\nviews of Lake Superior\nSouth trails is known for some really\nnasty climbs big climbs and big down\nhills big descents then you get over\nhere into the West End the old mining\ncountry\nit's just unforgiving it's not huge\nclimbs but it's just climbed after climb\nafter climb after climb and it's rocks\nand it's roots we had a racer last year\nKerry Laurie from down south\nshe came up he's a former and newly\nnational ultra endurance Series champion\nyou know and what she said that we've\nkind of latched on to is there's no free\ntrail out there even when you're going\ndownhill you're not necessarily having\nfun you're working your butt off so the\ntrail just old-school gnarly Mountain\nLake\none thing I'd say that does put us apart\nor set us apart is that were 90% a\nsingletrack whereas a lot of hundred\nmiles are open to track or gravel so\nthey're done a lot faster our event if\nyou have is 9 miles an hour you're doing\nreally good whereas the other event\nyou're gonna be 12 13 14 miles an hour\npeople when they first heard us say we\ndon't think you're gonna finish under 12\nhours and if you do we'll give your belt\nbuckle I think they thought the buckle\nis gonna be easy money after 2 years\nwe've given a way out of 6 or 700 people\nhave tried the race 30 buckles that's it\nso there's no free trail and the buckles\naren't easy money\nto put together hundred-mile you know\nwhich really spans the Tony and then the\n50-mile this year in the third year it\nstarts and Marquette does some of the\nNTN trail system on South trails and\nthen it heads west and really ends up\nprobably featuring best the Ramba trail\nsystem here in the West End that's the\npart as part of the race whether you're\ndoing the 50 or the hundred this west\nend the last 40 miles and then the last\n15 the races is known for the last 15\nbeing the hardest miles of the\nwe've got locals that do the race but as\nthis race has grown now we're getting\npeople from all across the country this\nyear the Margie gesek is part of the nu8\nnational halter endurance series it's a\nnational series actually it's\ninternational they have some races in\nEurope and overseas that's bringing\npeople from everywhere we got people\ncoming from the south we got people\ncoming from the west from the east from\nthe north and Canada there they're\ncoming from all over the place and I\nthink the race is really helping to put\nthe range mountain bike trails on the\nmap for mountain biking and it deserves\nto be on the map because these guys that\nstart at the club have been building\ntrail by hand for 30 years you know\nthey've done it because they love to\nride bikes and it's something that you\nknow they're gonna leave behind as a\nlegacy\nwe are a self-supported event they're\nunusual but basically what it means is\nthroughout the year we tell our racers\nyou're self supported you're on your own\nGPS is required and you can come and do\nthe race without GPS but if you choose\nto do then you end up in Lance we're not\ncoming to get you if you get hurt you're\ngonna need to call 911 and you need to\nbe self-sufficient that is the mantra of\nthe event there are no aid stations and\nthere's nobody out there to save you\nyou're on your own\nwell the really cool thing that's\nhappened community sponsored aid\nstations are community across Marquette\nCounty has come out every year and\nreally put out these incredible spreads\nof food and support and drink and\nencouragement for the racers the racers\nwho came from around the country all\nsaid that they have never been at an\nevent as well supported by the local\ncommunity as this one that is just\nblowing them away and that's you know\nit's it's it's a testament to the area\nwe live in and the people that are here\nto do something that they don't have to\ndo you know to be part of it I mean\nthat's another part of the unscripted\nnature of this event\nyou never know from year to year where\nit aid will be if it will be who it will\nbe or what it'll be so it's just really\ncool and I'm really glad that the\ncommunity is embraced it\nthat was you know Todd's idea the the\nblame thing you know he had these signs\nmate blame Danny blame Todd you know\nthey were usually on these excruciating\nhill climbs but I had this idea doing\none of the climbs that's on the course\nbut I'm thinking man this you know this\njust sucks\nthis is not fun at all Who am I gonna\nblame about it and that's where this\nidea came blame Danny and blame Todd and\nit's taken off I mean that's probably\none of the biggest parts of the race the\nrace has what would be referred to as a\nhigh attrition rate\nI'd say through the first two years and\nit's probably gonna hold true again\ntoday in year three the the rate of\npeople dropping out is from 55 to 60%\nevery year that you know they start but\nthey just they can't they can't get her\ndone and I think that's actually also\nwhat has added to the allure of the\nevent to be able to walk away from this\nand say you did it whether you've got a\nbelt buckle or you know you run a podium\nor not it doesn't matter because really\nthis day is about just finishing that's\nthat's really all that matters\nyou know I designed this course I didn't\nwant everybody to finish everybody\nfinished after the race everybody said\nwell okay I did that I'll move on to\nsomething else so we got to do something\nthat's tough as nails you know\neverything here in the U P is that way\nwe got the mines we got the logging\nindustry and everything else you know\nit's not easy work the Viking thing\nthat's what I wanted to portray here\npeople from out of the area have no idea\nwhat they're coming to when they come up\nhere we're one of the only ultra\nendurance events in the country or even\nthe Midwest that can say from the start\nto the finish it's all uphill we feel\npretty strongly that we're in pretty\nclose to 12,000 feet most people would\ntell you that there's no way you're\ngonna get to 12,000 feet of climbing you\nknow and in the Midwest\ncome to the race and find out you know\nwe have rocks we have rooks you know we\ndon't have 12,000 foot Peaks like they\nhave in Colorado but we have short steep\npunchy climbs that are never-ending\nperson came up to me and said there's no\nway you can get 11,000 feet of Marquette\nCounty you'd be lying I said okay trust\nme we'll get it and I saw him quitting\nlast year at 40 miles he says yeah you\ndid it\nit's it's interesting to see how this\nthing is grown I mean in three years\nwe've gone from an event that people\nsaid why are you doing this it's too\nhard nobody's ever gonna do it and Danny\nand I would look at each other and say\nwell we'll see and in the first year 117\npeople after that it exploded in social\nmedia with the feedback from people who\nhad been here in the second year the\nrace sold out in two weeks that race\nended up selling out to 600 participants\nand then this year I think we've done in\nlike 625 so it's just as continuing to\ngrow from what I started as\nMarja Kecak sat down from my laptop and\nI googled Ishpeming iron ore mining\nhistory and the name that kept coming up\nwas Margie gesek and so I started\nlooking you know deeper into the story\nand the story honestly for anybody is\nunfamiliar with Margie gesek I would say\nyou need to look into it it's it's a\ngreat story\na ton of Upper Peninsula history and\nheritage\nI was just so intrigued by how it kind\nof let me see into the history of the\narea things I didn't know\nI felt that name that story represented\nus well you know the toughness of of the\npeople who came before us their strength\nto go through that mining lifestyle is\nvery similar to what these bikers go\nthrough it's not easy now we got to\ngrind it out what life was like then and\nthat's what a day on the bike is like an\nemergency\nin the first year our finish line\nwe finished actually on Jasper knob here\nin issue amendment when the event grew\nto six hundred people last year it's not\npossible to run a finish line on top of\nJasper Knob the last couple years we've\nhad to move our finish line to downtown\nan instrument\nfirst of all running from marquette dish\nI mean helped us achieve our goal of\nwanting to be the only event in the\ncountry that is all uphill from start to\nfinish the other thing was it is all\nsorts of good stuff happening on the\nWest End but all the events that\ntypically start here they end down in\nMarquette so this is our way of kind of\nflipping that script finishing in ish we\nmean you know featuring a huge\ntransition area in the Gani showing what\nthe West End has to offer\nhopefully it is helping the you know the\nscreaming businesses a little bit by\nbring these people into town and and\nsupporting a local business three years\nago Todd Paquette asked me to run make\nthe award for the merger Kasich 100 and\nit was decided that a belt buckle would\nbe the award over a period of several\nweeks I made tools and designed to the\nprocess for making the belt buckles and\nthen went into production I think the\nfirst year I made 12 the second year I\nmade 60 22 of which forehand in Dallas\nand this year I made 24 as well as\nmaking the belt buckles I am stamping\nthe date in the belt buckle as the\nriders finished the race each one is\nindividually stamped for the rider\nmy name is Jeremiah Bishop with team 2p\ngurgaon one of the top three teams in\nthe world of ultra endurance mountain\nbike racing so please heed my warning\nwhen I tell you this is the hardest\nsingle day race in America it is mean it\nhas mud roots rocks sand a little bit of\neverything that's hard beautiful trails\nyou know hats off to the trail builders\nand local trail advocacy organizations\nwhich have obviously put and invested a\nlot into this area there's a area I want\nto come and visit just to ride I hear\npeople driving up from Ohio to\nand you know coming from all over the\nplace to check out the trails that\nthey're being built here this race in\nparticular is very interesting that has\nno official aid stations you know\ninitially my first reaction was what in\nthe world was that you know 10 hours for\n100-mile race I've probably done close\nto 40 500-mile races this is need for a\nlot of different reasons but what was\nspecial about it\nno aid stations I was out of water I\nsuffered but it was neat because I had\nhelp from people along the way and it\nwas super fun to experience new trails\nin a race and to test your limits I\nthink ultimately that's what the margin\ngesek 100 is about testing your limits\nhaving fun and I wouldn't have those\ninteractions with people if I had been a\nneed you know and that was special it\nmade it very different\nthe Margie gesek race and the other\nraces we do or the youth programming\nthat we do it's all non profit last year\nI want to say that the merchants gesek\ngave twenty thousand dollars back to\nlocal trail builders which I'd like to\nthink isn't just supporting bikers but\nit's supporting bikers hikers walkers\nrunners anybody who's a silent sports\nenthusiast I'd like to think that we're\nsomehow adding some value to our\ncommunity and helping give them more\nthings to explore and more adventures to\ntell their friends about but that's\nthat's definitely something that it's\nnot that we're trying to brag about it\nbut I think it's important for everybody\nto know and it's probably also the\nreason why the community has supported\nit everything we're trying to do that\nwe've been running around all week you\nknow busting our butts to do is to give\nback I don't think there's anything that\nyou can give a person or another person\nin your life it's more valuable and your\ntime and you know it's one thing to give\nmoney which I'm not trying to downplay\nthat or devalue it but you know\neverybody's short on time and when you\nlook around this city today initially\nyou see all these people out here\nvolunteering and 88 degree weather on\nSeptember 23rd or whatever day it is\nthey don't have to be there they're\ngiving their time and they're giving it\nback to these racers into
