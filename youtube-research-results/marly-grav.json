      "description": "Tof dat je mijn filmpjes kijkt! Ben je enthousiast, gooi een duimpje omhoog en wil je niets missen, abonneer je dan vooral!\n\nVandaag de gravel wedstrijd van Marly Grav in Valkenburg. Een 155km lange gravelwedstrijd door de limburgse heuvels. 3 rondjes van net iets meer dan 50km. Ieder rondje is hetzelfde, maar toch net weer ietsje anders. We beginnen met de cauberg, zonder noordelijke lus. Dan de mergelgrotte met de noordelijke lus en uiteindelijk een onverhard alternatief voor de cauberg met nog eens de noordelijke lus. De klimmetjes zijn niet langer dan 2km, dus dat is redelijk te overzien. Het totaal aantal hoogtemeters valt ook nog wel mee, al betekent dat het in de wedstrijd alleen maar harder zal gaan... Een taaie kluif dus, laten we snel gaan kijken!\n\nVolg mij ook online:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/koenego/\nStrava: https://www.strava.com/athletes/552035\nTiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@koenego\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/KoenTimmermans\nThreads: komt zo spoedig mogelijk!\n\nWordt lid van dit kanaal en krijg toegang tot SPECIALE MOGELIJKHEDEN!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR6RouXkjqfd69Cn2NZL7Ow/join",

      "transcript": "The course is basically a triangular\nlap. We drop down from the northerly\npoint at beak. We drop down across to\nVaval western side. We then go across to\nReus on the right hand side of the base\nof the track before coming back up to\nbeat the men doing three and a half laps\nof that race circuit. Florian Visha\nBisos along with Flores Mantric and\nNeils Polllet broke clear of the bunch.\nmove on the front just coming through\nthis beat and the bel just seeing this\ngroup come together. Pressure goes on\nthe front to try and break this clear\nas we start to see Blet lose touch with\nthe lead. He's been doing so much work\non the front now. Can he get himself\nback on? He chased onto that initial\nleading group. He wasn't in that leader\ngroup initially. The leading group of\nVish Beast Boss and Van Tri had gone\nclear. And you can see here issues with\nthat chain on the bike as the riders\ndisappear off into the distance there.\nSo Flores Vantric Floren Vish and Fritz\nBeast Boss the leaders Neils Plet at the\nmoment just a distance behind having to\nwork to get back on after those issues\nwith the gears. It's not a decisive gap\nbetween the front and the back of this\ngroup at the moment. It's just separated\nones and the twos and Modric now pushes\non. Castelli who is now sitting second\nwheel to Modric in that chasing group\ngoing along with Tim Wellins here as we\nsee Niels now see the express train\nbeing driven the locomotive that is\nmoderation on the front here\nnow on the move of the road for company.\nthe group behind the pressure as he's\ncome out. That group just reforming once\nagain.\nOh, just taking a look at the moment.\nMorish at the moment continue to push\nwith Stey and Plet again being distance\nonce the pace is lifted in the latter\nstages of this race. All that work has\ngone in early on at the moment the chase\nbehind. Well, that is still coming from\nStey and Modic. And at the moment I\nthink we are going to see Plet being\nswept up by the second of those chasing\ngroups.\nThe gap despite the best arrow efforts\nof Modric still goes back out again to\n38 seconds. Now these three showing no\nsigns of capitulating at this stage\nas they come through here. Just the gap\nstarting to open to Vantric. So Vish now\njust losing contact on the way through\nhere leaving two riders at the front\nhere. The lead is now down to two twice\nsilver medalist flowing from of Bris\nof the Netherlands.\nYou can just see at the moment though\nthis is Modric along with Felix Steelli\ngoing to be hooed up by them on the way\nthrough. We'll see what he's got in the\ntank. Will he try and latch on to this\nduo as they come down past in towards\nbeak? Our two leaders though still clear\nby 50 seconds from anybody else out on\nthe road. We're heading for 30 km left\nto go in today's world championships\nhere as they make their way down\nthrough. You can just see the\nconcentration on the pace now. Just a\nlittle bit of a slight out for Flores of\nVan Thricia for just a loss of wheels on\nthe gravel there. Just drifted down.\nThere's a little bit of a bank. Then you\nhit those marbles. Down goes Vanrici.\nThat has done the damage now. And Vash\nStreet firmly in fifth place and left\nchasing\nRich on the front here. Steady at the\nrear of the two riders currently in\nthird and fourth position. potentially a\nmedal at stake, a bronze medal or be it\nat stake at the moment as we see another\nbig kick coming. What you can see he\nwent from behind. You could just see a\nlong turn there by Bishabush and instead\nof coming to the front and doing a turn.\nWell, Visha puts in the attack, he does\nin the dirt. He goes over the top as the\nelbow flicked, but that is by racing.\nAnd now Vish really on the attack behind\nhim. Vos losing a little bit more ground\nat the moment. He chases Modric now well\nover 1 minute 16 back. That has gone\nback out again. As we now see Marriage\nstart to move and clear. A fight is\ncoming from Fish Steady. But at the\nmoment, former champion Modric on the\nmove on the ascent. 13 seconds separate\nVisha from Bosch. It's 1 minute 18 from\nthe front of the race to Modish.\nIs that a smile on the face of Floren\nBish with 11K to go? is now starting to\nbelieve that this is his because this is\nthe run. He's punching the end like he\nknows Florian Vich twice silver medalist\nis going to come across the line to take\nvictory. The UCI gravel world champion\nfor 2025. It is going to be Florian\nBish.\nThe bike is lifted loft as he crosses\nthe line. It's a home rider taking the\nsilver medal here today at the men's\nelite race. What a ride by. It's going\nto be just over a minute behind our race\nwinner\nto the crowd there today as Marage\ncruises his way in over the line.\nOur world champion crowd. He takes the\nmen's elite title for Belgium ahead of\nfree speech in second place taking the\nsilver medal for the Netherlands and\nMatric taking third place."

Everything was hanging underneath my handlebars, so I couldn\u2019t see it during the race.\n\nBecause of that, I could only record for about 2 hours. Lesson learned for next time! \ud83d\ude05\n\n\nUCI Gravel World Championship \u2014 Beek, South Limburg (NL) \ud83c\udf0d\nFirst 60k of the race I\u2019d been looking so hard forward to after I qualified myself for the worlds in Turnhout.

The start actually went surprisingly well \u2014 probably pure adrenaline \u26a1 \u2014 but pretty fast, reality kicked in. Burning lungs, a runny nose, and no air left. I pulled the plug around 86k. The body said no. \ud83d\udc80\n\nHuge respect for all the riders from 53 different countries \ud83c\udf0e \u2014 the level was insane, absolute beasts out there \ud83d\udcaa\n\nNow, looking back, the disappointment hits hard\u2026 but still, it\u2019s an experience I\u2019ll never forget \u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83d\udd25\n\nWere you there at Gravel Worlds, or did you watch it?\nLet me know what you thought of the race in the comments! \ud83d\udc47\n\nSubscribe for more gravel race stories \ud83d\udeb4\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83d\udd25\n\n\ud83c\udfa5 Hotspots / Highlights:\n1:20 crazy Dutch guy on the left \ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddf1\n1:46 again and crazy Spanish guy following \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8\n2:55 sandwich incoming \ud83e\udd6a\n5:41 panic \u2014 don\u2019t touch the brakes pls \ud83d\ude2c\n7:15 crash on the left \ud83d\udca5\n9:05 first gravel section \u2014 look at the madness in front! \ud83d\ude31\n11:10 hit and run against an Englishman \ud83d\ude05 sorry man\n11:22 big 3+ min effort to close the gap \ud83d\udca8\n15:20 fast descent \u2b07\ufe0f\n18:05 pushing steady watts \u2014 trying not to burn myself \ud83d\udd25 still loosing positions \n35:00 leaders of age group 45\u201349 overtaking (purple numbers!) \ud83d\udc9c\n36:40 fast gravel \u26a1\n39:04 flying up the climb \u26f0\ufe0f\n45:10 strong guys! \ud83d\udcaa\n47:15 struggling with energy gel \u2014 lost the group \ud83d\ude05 came together a bit further\n57:40 Wijnandsrade \u2014 riding through the castle \ud83c\udff0\n1:01:35 use the curbs! \ud83e\uddf1\n1:10:23 pushing downhill to 65 km/h \ud83d\ude0e\n1:11:40 strong German guy \u2014 had to let him go on top \ud83c\udde9\ud83c\uddea bad feeling coming in the lungs\n1:23:24 back in Beek \u2014 heading to the start zone \ud83c\udfc1\n1:34:20 way too much dumb headwork \ud83e\udde0\n1:38:20 hope this guy\u2019s OK, that looked nasty \ud83e\udd15\n1:44:35 fast downhill coming again \ud83d\udca8\n1:51:10 bottle paradise \ud83c\udf7c\n1:52:47 bottle for me \ud83e\udd64\n1:53:25 party on the climb \ud83c\udf89\n\n\n\n#UCIGravelWorlds\n#GravelWorldChampionships\n#GravelRacing\n#gravelbike \n#WKgravel\n#CyclingLife\n#GravelGrinder\n#CyclingVlog\n#RaceDay\n#AllOrNothing\n#CyclingJourney\n#LimburgGravel\n#CyclistLife\n#RoadToWorlds\n#beek",

out to be a huge mistake\nobviously luckily I had the chance to\nfigure out what to do while having a\nsafe spot in a tiny little abandoned\nhouse where I was invited to stay at so\nlean back and enjoy watching my little\nmessy chaotic start into my next\nadventure hi out let's go\nI just arrived I think 2 hours ago and\nI'm still packing my bike I thought that\nit would take less time to get

was still daylight ah\nmorning I have my first night outside\nand this morning I tried to reorganize\nmy stuff because yesterday at the\nairport I just threw everything inside\nthe bags it's a big big big big mess and\nI have to uh get to a place where I can\nunpack everything and then sort my stuff\nI don't know why I'm not organized like\nI did that for almost one year and now I\ndon't know how

oh\nI'm already\nreorganizing I thought I'd be smart and\njust use my credles and I put them here\nand I thought oh that is perfect but now\nwhen I'm pedaling my feet they bump\nagainst this thing here it wasn't very\nsmart to just use the cred\nusually you use it together with another\npart it goes from this pole to the other\npole and then you can attach your bags\nthere but I thought I wouldn't need the\npole and now I do know better I didn't\ntest the setup and now ah day number one\nand I'm already using the duct tape\nsurprise I have to find a solution for\nthis problem um because otherwise I\ncannot I cannot uh cycle because my feet\nare in such a weird position and yeah so\nlet's just see okay that's the final\nfinal thing now um and I will just\nstarted cycling so
