      "description": "Maxxis rolled into the heart of New South Wales wine country for the highly anticipated Marys Mayhem gravel race, part of the fast-growing Graveleur Series in Mudgee. With a full event setup that put the brand front and centre, Maxxis made its presence felt at one of Australia's favourite gravel events.\n\nThe race drew an enthusiastic crowd of over 300 riders, all keen to explore the scenic backroads of Mudgee. From the moment the ride kicked off under the iconic Maxxis arch to the final rider crossing the line. Maxxis was part of the experience, flags flying, tyres turning, and good vibes all around.\n\nWe're stoked to have been part of such an incredible weekend in Mudgee for Marys Mayhem and extend a big thank you to the Graveleur team for hosting another top-tier event. \nAs the gravel scene continues to grow, Maxxis is proud to roll with it. one ride at a time.\n\n#Wearemaxxis #Maxxisbikeau #Maxxistyres #Maxxisgravel",

      "transcript": "[Music]\n[Applause]\nhey guys welcome back to the channel a\nfew weeks ago a few of our guys went out\nto Mary's Mayhem and mji so this event\nwas marketed as one of the easiest and\nmost laid-back events at the team over\nat graeler hold we were told it wasn't a\nrace but a socier ride spread across two\ndays in some of the best gravel around\nmji and\nRalston day one kicked off just outside\nof mji at small batch Brewery and headed\ntowards gong through barrel and back to\nthe brewery for a total of 98 km and 900\nme cling\n3 2\n1 as we rolled out we turn left onto the\nTAC and onto the first little climb of\nthe day we're just setting a nice patal\nPace up the hill\nwe're all just chatting between each\nother about the day that was about to\ncome but as soon as the tires hit the\ngravel all hell broke loose absolute\nmake\ndi B Be feel it rage power weakest BS\nmoney driven major fraud breathless\nbuddy\nDiamond W to be it w to feel it\nfeel it R\npower money power\npower we money driven ma fraud\nbreathless bu Diamond RS W to be it want\nto feel it rage power weakest Falls\nmoney driv ma fraud breathless body\nin the first 50 km we ended up in a\npretty small group but rotating really\ngood turns and pce lining our way to the\nfirst food stop holding an average of\nabout 33 km hour and by the time we\nrolled into the first feed station we\nwere definitely feeling it luckily the\nlocals had us covered with one of the\nbest spreads I've ever seen\ngood homemade food plenty of water and\nenough brownies to power us through the\nrest of the ride so we fueled up filled\nup our bottles and go back on the road\na\nyou\nthe last Loop of the day retrace the\nfirst part of the ride over the hills\ntowards Frog Rock and back by this point\nafter several tough hours on the bike\nand with a smell of beer in the air we\nwere seriously tempted to cut the ride\nshort but we pushed through and finished\nlong course in about 3 hours and 45\nminutes about 45 minutes\nthat was that last little coming past\nhere and having to go around again yeah\nthat's suck I had about six cramps just\non the edge and I'm like no don't do it\nmicro right come let's get ay one me\nput some dirt\non for you thank you\nBab like smashed I\nsmashed as soon as we finished the beers\nwere flowing at small batch and the vibe\nwas all of a sudden relaxed again having\nthe Finish light of the brewery might be\nthe best idea I've ever seen and we sat\nback in the sun cheered on the other\nfinishes enjoyed the late back out\nin third place the time 3 hours 29\nminutes and 30 seconds\nemers the time second place time of 3\nhours 2924 Nicole o and way out in front\nand actually second overall in the 100\nkm race in a time of 3 hours 1 minute\nand 4 seconds din Ricard\nand our winner 100K EV in a time of 3\nhours and 49 seconds an average speed of\n33.1 they are PA\nwils the final finisher on day\none they will up\nwoooo oh Lord\nfor they cost they cost $200 exactly hly\nit could be called the undercover\ncyclist they're like underneath their\nnormal it's come to get the worst of\nus baby I'm need\nbaby\nbabab day two started with a few strong\ncopes and then a 40-minute drive out to\nRon\noh\nkisses the planned route took us\nNortheast towards Cox Creek and into the\nstate forest back towards R for about\n100 K and 1100 me of\nclimbing baby\nwhen we arrived in Ralston the vibe felt\ntotally different no timing chips\neveryone just seemed much more relaxed\nsome of the riders that have been\npushing hard the day before were now\ncruising with their kids party shirts\nwere out and the lollies were being\nshared around it was clear that we were\nall just there for a fun day on the bike\nhey\nbaby we rolled out on some of the\nsmoothest Tac I've ever ridden on the\ngravel bike surrounded by mountains in\nthe stunning Countryside of\nRost\nkchen baby\nbaby had R 25ks in the gravel kicked in\nand it was perfect Mike the event\ndirector had warned us that the roads\nhad just been recently graded but even\nthat didn't prepare us for just how\nperfect it was going to be to ride\nthis is GRA\nthis\nhe\none of the highlights of the day was a\nplan detour to the Kad River some Riders\neven took a dip in the icy water before\ngetting back on the bike it was a great\ncontrast to the intensity before\nsh\nthe end of the climbing was marked with\na food station overlooking the state for\nbut they had a bunch of spare water and\nsome more snacks for us our group had\nhad a couple of Mechanicals on the way\nup so we took a moment to rest the legs\nand wait for them to catch up we had a\ngood old yarn with some of the locals\nthat gave us a little bit of an insight\ninto potential variations of the route\nfor the next time we pop down which we'd\nalready started\nplanning from here it was all downhill\nThe Descent was an absolute blast and\nthe Tailwind didn't hurt either it was\none of those perfect moments where\neverything just comes together and we\nwere absolutely flying back down the\nhill\nw\nas we started to close in on the Finish\nLine back in Ralston we were sitting\npretty doing an easy 35 to 40ks an hour\nwith almost no power and we were\nredirected to the final surprise of the\nday which is a little detour to the wall\nof my standing stones\ncome\nrolling back into town you could hear\nthe music from a few streets away and\nall of the locals had come out in swarms\nto fill the garden of the globe hotel\nwith stalls from wineries to breweries\nand local produce and there was just an\namazing atmosphere everyone had clearly\nhad a great day on the bikes not just\nus we ended up just parking up in the\nsun having a few beers with the locals\nand we ended up bumping into Allison who\nwas the person responsible for planning\nthe route for this day she gave us a\ncouple little tips for some Vari on the\nroute that we just done so we'll be\npopping down to do some of those cuz if\nthey're anything like the one that we\njust done I know they'll be worth three\nand a half hour drive from\nSydney\nM the L on Rouge for day\ntwo of Mary's Mayhem part of the Bush\nRanger series graer\n2024 Charlotte\nbucanan now there's no speech going on\nthere okay that is it Bar's Mayhem 2024\nrun and one\nyou for our race director Mike\nIsrael thanks everyone\nM uh wow what a weekend um I'm going to\ntell you straight up I'm pretty\nemotional right now so I may not get\nthrough this but um it's just blown me\naway this weekend it really has so thank\neveryone I can't believe\nit if you've seen any of my other videos\nyou'll know that I'm a big fan of the\nGrava team but honestly with Mary's\nMayhem they really went above and beyond\nfrom the root design to raing the local\ninvolvement it was clear they put a\nserious amount of Blood Sweat and\nliteral tears into making this event um\nand it was incredibly special both on\nand off the bike uh so for me this event\nis a 10 out of 10 without a doubt and\nI'll be coming back next year but uh\nhopefully with some race legs on for day\none"
