      "description": "Here are some super-slow motion video clips from the March 19th, 2022 Melting Mann gravel bike race in Vandalia Michigan.  I was just a spectator not an official photographer.  I was having fun and they were working hard.  I don\u2019t like work!  I did not cover the event but went to sections that the 24 mile was on so there is a lot missing, I think I got some faster 34 and 60 mi riders also.   For my photographer friends: Video was shot with a Sony A7SIII camera at ISO 12,800 (not a typo)  1/500  sec, f-9.0 in HD, S-Log3 10 bit 4:2:2, 240 fps",
