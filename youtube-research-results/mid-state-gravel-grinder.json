      "transcript": "you ever buy something thinking it was\nperfect only to realize later you had no\nidea what you were doing well that was\nme with my first gravel bike I thought I\nwas getting the Ultimate Adventure\nmachine but it turns out I was wrong but\nwhat if you could skip the mistakes and\ngo straight to the good part imagine\nknowing exactly what to look for before\ndropping all that cash on the wrong\ngravel bike I mean yeah sounds great and\nafter years of Adventure cycling riding\neverything from Cross Bikes to all types\nof modern gravel bikes I figured out\nwhat actually matters some of it's\ncommon knowledge and some of it goes\nagainst what brands want you to believe\nso let's break it down here's what I\nwish I knew before I bought my first\ngravel\n[Music]\nbike all right I'll admit it I got my\nfirst gravel bike before gravel was\nactually a thing it was actually a\ncrossbike anyone else do that and while\nit kind of worked it quickly became\nevident where it was lacking it was\ntight tall and could barely fit 33 mm\ntires which by today's standards this is\nconsidered very small especially for\noff-road bikes in fact this starts\nblending into the category that I call\nAllroad bikes which are essentially road\nbikes that you occasionally take\noff-road here's the thing Tire clearance\nis everything the more clearance you get\nthe more options you have big tires\nlittle tires fenders you could set it up\nfor a fast type a ro day or for a back\ncountry ramble Mission so you're allowed\nflexibility based on the ride this one\nwould have been helpful 15 years ago it\nwould have saved me a lot of headache if\nyou get a bike with smaller clearance\nyou're essentially limiting the\npotential capability of that bike and\nfor reference if I was looking for bikes\nright now I would look at things that\ncould clear up to a 2 in or 50 mm\nTire I've wasted a lot of time scouring\ngeometry charts stack reach head Tu ble\nI thought this was the secret to finding\nthe perfect bike and I honestly didn't\nknow what the hell I was actually\nlooking at but after riding dozens of\ndifferent gravel bikes there's a few\nthings I've learned I've found that\ngeometry doesn't matter quite as much as\nI'd thought and there's a few reasons\nwhy our bodies have a tremendous ability\nto adapt to physical situations and\nsometimes that's to a fault for example\nwe could be riding the wrong Fit bike\nfor a very long time but there is a way\nto make sure that doesn't happen that's\nto get a proper bike fit this can guide\nwhich size to get and how to dial in in\nthe bike after you have it plus playing\nwith different tire sizes and pressure\nwill have a dramatic effect on how the\nbike handles and performs in different\nterrain big tires low pressure makes a\nbike more stable in rougher terrain\nsmall Tire high pressure will amplify\nhandling on smooth surface and give the\nillusion of faster speeds so instead of\noveranalyzing Geo charts focus on Tire\nclearance and consider getting a bike\nfit shipping a bike shouldn't feel like\nsolving a puzzle but if you've ever\ntried you know the struggle is real\nridiculous shipping fees confusing\npacking requirements and the crippling\nfear knowing our bike might not make it\nin one piece it's frustrating it's\noverwhelming and while it often is it\ndoesn't have to be this hard enter bike\nflights they're actually cyclists like\nthey know what a derailer is they're a\nteam of bike shipping experts supporting\nyour shipment from door to door and\nthey've shipped over 1 and2 million\nbikes so they're qualified and their\nmission to make shipping bikes as easy\nas riding them woo thank you for that\nstep one go to bikeflights.com step two\nbook your shipment in minutes time step\nthree get your bike packed picked up and\nsafely delivered without the\nstress and if you need a box\nthey've got you covered honestly it's\nbrilliant it goes from this to this it's\nbeen a long time since I've been this\nexcited about three ply corrugated\ncardboard save up to 40% on shipping\nwith the best protection for your bike\nhit the link down below and let's get\nyour bike to where it needs to go minus\nthe\nheadache steel carbon aluminum titanium\nI used to think material was everything\nand over the last 25 years I've ridden\npretty much every material out there but\nhere's the thing there's one thing that\nhas an even bigger impact over the\nhandling and control of your bike we're\ntalking about tires larger tires with\nlower pressure are going to have a more\ndramatic effect over the handling\ncompliance and feel of your bike for the\ndollar than any frame material will\nespecially if you're on a budget don't\nstress about the perfect frame material\nput that effort into getting a good set\nof wheels and experimenting with some\ntires hey what are your favorite tires\nright\nnow people love throwing money at fancy\nupgrades and don't get me wrong I'm a\nsucker for some nice shiny bike parts\nbut nothing I mean nothing will improve\nyour ride experience more than getting a\nbike fit as unromantic as they are they\ndo have a big impact it'll make you more\ncomfortable more efficient and less\nprone to injury which you can use on\nother builds and once the fit is dialed\nin there is one upgrade that can\nactually make up for a lower quality\nframe and that is to invest in some\nupgraded Wheels while they can be\nexpensive and somewhat unglamorous\nupgraded Wheels can have a massive\nimpact on your bike they increase\nacceleration handling n is the single\ngreatest way to level up any build I'm\ntelling you alloy frame with some\nhigh-end Wheels is going to feel\ncomparable to a full high-end carbon\nbuild for a fraction of the cost if I\ncould do it all over again I'd invest in\nfit first wheel second and everything\nelse last\nanother thing that I learned the hard\nway less is more like many people I\nstarted with a 2 by drive train\nlogically thinking more was more but\nafter years of adventure riding I\nfinally come around to understand what\nmountain bikers have figured out long\nago if you ramble you one by sure Tu buy\noffers smoother transitions between the\ngears but if you're riding the rough\nstuff one by is simply just easier to\nwrap your head around easier\nharder\nsimple this is how you can tell if a\nbike brand is using bandwagon marketing\nor gravel washing if a bike has a max\nTire clearance of 38 mm that's not a\ngravel bike that's an endurance or\nAllroad bike with some lazy marketing\nany self-respecting gravel bike is going\nto have a minimum Max clearance of 45 mm\nand if you're riding any amount of\nrugged terrain or would actually like to\nrun fenders I suggest looking for a\nclearance at a minimum of 50 mm which\nunfortunately is exactly why I rarely\nrun my titanium stinner minimal\nclearance and no mounts for fenders\nmeans I just don't ride it as much as I\nwould like to now if I was just starting\nout here's what I'd tell myself focus on\nMax Tire clearance more than GE ometry\nframe material is overrated focus on\nwheels don't overthink the drivetrain\none by simple and reliable and get a\nproper bike fit before upgrading\nanything else or even before the you get\nthe bike and the best part none of these\nchoices are permanent you can upgrade\ntweak and adjust to your preference over\ntime and if you've been looking for a\ncommunity of non-competitive Adventure\nSeekers feel free to subscribe if you've\ngot any questions put them down below\nthe community is very informed and\nhilarious gravel bikes are about\nadapting to constantly changing\nconditions and that's what makes them so\nwonderful so if you're thinking of\ngetting a gravel bike or upgrading the\none you have these should help although\nto understand how far you can push all\nof this you'll have to watch this video\nright here yeah that thing is crazy and\nthat thing is crazy\nI that's all I can come up with"

      "description": "With under 60miles and less than 100ft/mile of climbing this stage was fixing to be fast. Then add in some additional 2 day racers like Gordon and we were set to rip through Rothrock. This was the most scenic stage so far, Though, not in the sense of beautiful vistas because we were deep in the canopy most of the time. However, the thick old growth, damp roads, and deep green cover was putting off PNW vibes. \n\nA big group of 6 or so rolled early. Then stayed together until just after the aid. Eddie pushed up a stair stepping double track into a longer chunky descent. We got a gap over the top and likely extended it on the way down. From there it was 15 miles to the finish with no major climbs. \n\nEddie tried to shake me on the final 5 min climb up into camp but I held on and led into the final corner, grabbing the W!\n\nOne more day!\n\nThese videos take a lot of  time to make and sometimes the adventures are expensive.
