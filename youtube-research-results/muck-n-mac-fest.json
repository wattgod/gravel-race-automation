      "description": "Muck n' Mac Fest 29th April - 1st May 2022. \n\nStaged in the grounds of Scotland's oldest inhabited Home, Traquair House will host the inaugural festival in 2022.\n\nNestled in the heart of the Tweed Valley, Traquair just so happens to be the gateway to some of the finest gravel riding the country has to offer! \n\nOver the course of the weekend, riders will take on 6 timed stages, which are accumulated in a GC format for the overall. In between, the clock stops running, giving riders the opportunity to kick back, have a blether and take in the rolling hills of the Borders that surround. \n\nThe weekend is as much about riding as the time off the bike. Our festival village has an amazing mix of activities on offer. Expect to see; live music, film, event partner expo, camping, yoga, bar areas, mixed catering experiences and various family friendly activities around the grounds of the house.",

      "description": "Ever wondered what us industry bods do whilst you're out racing at events? May 2025 saw Muck n Mac kick off the GrAlba Series of gravel cycling races and Grinduro Scotland. I went along to represent Bridgedale - one of my bike industry clients - and speak to riders and event organisers as well as network with some bike industry friends.\n\nMuch more to come to the channel from more behind the scenes videos to race videos, Hyrox, The Gralloch, Sarn Helen challenge, Grinduro, Gritfest and much more as well as more about living life without limits and life without number as we aim for World Champs qualifying in UCI gravel and Hyrox fitness racing.\n\nThis channel is dedicated to all those people 45+ (or approaching the age milestone) who think their best fitness years are behind them. Join me and together we will prove that wrong! Life is for adventure and to move. Experience it all, age is just a number. Live #lifewithoutnumber Life starts here!\n\nThanks for watching folks! \n\nI am a bike industry professional of many years but al products here are bought by me and are not clients. I will always say when a product featured is a client of mine. No BS. It's the way I live and honesty is the very least anyone deserves in life.\n\nwww.redcloudmc.com",

      "transcript": "Hello and welcome back to Life Without\nNumber. Um, yeah, something a little bit\ndifferent today and something I want to\ndo uh a little bit more often on on the\nchannel is uh give you kind of behind\nthe scenes at a weekend at a bike event.\nUh, so I'm at Muckmack Festival uh in\nthe Scottish Borders. Um, really quite a\nnice setting, I have to say. Uh, but\nwhat I'm going to do is take you behind\nthe scenes of uh what I've got to do\nhere this weekend. Um this is the kind\nof night before setup. So uh there's a\nlot more stuff to come tomorrow. Um but\nuh yeah, I'm here with Bridgedale uh who\nhave uh in the last couple of years\nlaunched a range of bike socks uh bike\nspecific socks and yeah, I'm just here\nkind of to help get the uh brand\nawareness up, get the name out there a\nbit more and and most importantly talk\nto some riders, get some feedback, all\nthat kind of stuff. So this isn't going\nto be a salesy video. I'm not going to\nbe here selling bridged out. is purely a\nwhat do us industry people get up to at\nevents when we're not talking to you\ngood folks riding bikes. Uh I've got to\nbe honest, I wish I was riding a bike.\nUm the uh the event does look very very\ncool. Um so yeah, not much to see at the\nminute. If you really want to see behind\nthe scenes in all its\nrawness, I'm the first one\nhere. There's absolutely nobody here. So\nthis is about as raw as it's going to\nbe. So, uh, with that note, I'll show\nyou my little camp setup and then, uh,\nI'll probably do another video, um, kind\nof the actual event itself over the\ncoming couple of days. So, uh, yeah,\nshow you the, uh, the Hilton on wheels.\nI might have exaggerated about the\nHilton on\nwheels. It's a tent. So, yeah. Uh, those\npeople that think us industry bods are\nliving the life of Riley, um, this is\nthe reality. Um, nothing wrong with it.\nI quite like it. Um, as you can see,\nI've made interesting use of a Stanley\nFatmax toolbox. Um, so you've got all\nthe food in one and uh all the other\nkind of odds and sods that you need\nthere. And then over\nhere, the cooking area. So that is the\nkitchen. Not something I normally say to\npeople on YouTube, but uh I will show\nyou the\nbedroom. Look at that. Okay. Height of\nluxury. Height of\nluxury. For those interested, um, and\nI'm sure somebody out there probably is,\nthis is an O tent. Uh, so it's, uh,\nbasically just a kind of fold out and\npop-up type tent. Uh, so you can get it\nkind of up within a couple of minutes.\nUm, so it's quite handy when you're, uh,\ngoing to events. But anyway, yeah,\ncompletely alone. Um, so yeah, we're\njust outside in Althan. Much more\ntomorrow once we've got the stand built\nout.\nSo, had my uh had my evening meal of\nboiling a bag\npasta. Cost control. Cost control. Um,\nI'm just out for a little bit of a walk.\nSo Mock is at um Traqua House. I think\nthat's how you say it. In Ethan, I'm\nreally hoping you can hear me cuz I\nhaven't got my uh microphone on. So\nhopefully you can hear me.\nUm and yeah, it's really lovely. Um so\nyeah, why am I doing this video? Well,\nto be\nhonest, I think it's because hopefully\nyou'll find it of interest first and\nforemost. Um I think there is a just\nfrom kind of speaking to consumers,\nriders, um people\non Facebook forums and and things like\nthat. Um there's this kind of I think a\nsense that us bike industry bods are,\nyou know, coining it in and uh living\nthe life of of luxury. Well, there's a\nthere's a saying in the bike world to\nmake a small fortune in in the bike\nindustry, you have to start with a large\none. Um, so yeah, I I get I get all the\ncomments about pricing and things. I\ncompletely understand it. I hate I'm a\nrider, too. I I I don't get given these\nthings. I have to buy them just like you\ndo. Um, and uh, so I completely\nunderstand it. But trust me, no one's\nmaking a fortune in the bike industry.\nUm, they're really not. But it's not a\nso story. I absolutely love my job. I\nlove the industry I work in. A great\nbunch of people. And you get to ride\nbikes as well and come to cool places\nlike this. But yeah, I just wanted to\nkind of show you a little bit of the\nreality of it. Uh hope so. Hope that's\ngoing to be of interest to you. Um and\nalso as I'm walking and I'm feeling kind\nof That's a very artistic shot. Well\ndone. Uh try not to go dizzy. Uh as I'm\nwalking, I thought I'd also tell you a\nlittle bit about um life without number.\nAnd I probably need to do a video on a\nstandalone video on this, but um what is\nlife without number? Well, life without\nnumber is just that. It's about living\nyour life not limited by numbers whether\nthat's age or money or whatever it is.\nYou know all everything in life comes in\nnumbers. Um but you know why you should\nalways keep them in mind. Don't let that\nlimit you. I mean I'm 52 years old. Um\nnot old, not young. Well, a little bit\nold. Um but I still want to get to the\ngravel world champs. I still want to do\nExtera. I still want to get to the high\nrocks world champs.\nUm, I'm not going to let things limit\nme. Um, you know, you're not here for a\nlong time. So, that's what it's going to\nbe about. It's going to be about\nfitness, adventure, going out, doing\nwhat you really want to do, pushing\nyourself, seeing what you're capable of,\nscaring yourself, rewarding yourself,\nenjoying life's ups, understanding\nlife's downs. Um, it's it's all part of\nthe this great experience we call life.\nSo, before we get too philosophical,\ndon't want to do philosophy. Um, that's\nkind of what I mean by life without\nnumber. So,\nuh, it it's always weird when I'm I'm\ndoing these pieces to camera and of\ncourse you're walking places like this\npublic area, people just look at you\ngone out. It's like, what is this madman\ndoing? Um, walking along staring at this\nlittle sticky thing and talking to\nhimself. But, uh, yeah. So, anyway, I've\nnow got down to what I believe is Traqua\nHouse. If it's not, it's a very, very\nfancy garden shed. Um, so I'll quickly\nshow you this and then I'll shut up\nbecause everyone's looking at me now\nlike I'm I'm slightly insane.\nUm, maybe I am. Um, so what have we got\ndown here? That's very pretty. Right,\nthere you\ngo. Very nice,\neh? Very posh.\nNo, that's not my\nhome. I know I work in the bike industry\nand I know I'm coining it in, but that\nis not my home. Uh, no, it's um I\ncouldn't afford the heating in that, let\nalone the actual\nbuilding. But anyway, that's enough\nwaffle for me. I'm going to walk back\nand\nuh sit down, make myself a hot drink,\nand call it a night. So, tomorrow, let\nthe fun begin.\nSo, setup day.\nUm, yeah, let the fun begin. I need to\nget a new sleeping bag. I was frozen\nlast night. Anyway, that's my problem.\nUm, so yeah, a quick look\naround. Few more people turning up.\nVictoria there. Always good to see\nVictoria at these events. Yellow over\nthere. And yeah, this is our little\npitch here. So, best crack on\nSo, day one of the event,\nuh, Friday. Yeah, it's been good. Easy\nsetup. Um, and just kind of, to be\nhonest, lazing around, uh, waiting for\npeople to arrive. Um, but yeah, about\n5:00 obviously end of the working week.\nUh, everyone started turning up. I've\njust realized how much I've caught the\nsun today. It has been quite sunny. Uh,\nand yeah, it's just such a cool uh\nsetting. So, look, I'm just going to\nspin you around. It's like we're\nentering a secret garden or\nsomething. Look at that.\nAnd then over\nhere you've got where kind of evening\nentertainment\nis all very picturesque and very\nserene. Not the shabiest place I've been\nto for a bike event. I got to be honest.\nSo, I've just grabbed a a bite to eat\nand I thought it's a good time just to\nkind of sit down and\nand kind of explain for those that don't\nknow uh what it is I actually do in the\nbike industry. Um so, basically I I'm\nself-employed um since\n2007. Uh I've been um marketing\nconsultant to the the bike industry both\nhere in the UK and across Europe and and\nNorth America. Uh working with all\naspects of the bike industry. So event\norganizers, brands, manufacturers,\nretailers,\num yeah, local authorities on on kind of\ncycling infrastructure and things like\nthat. So a kind of varied bag and this\nis on the back of of senior marketing\nroles in in music and um media and\nthings like that. So yeah, I'm I'm one\nof those marketing people. Um but I mean\nbasically what I do is I kind of\neverything from high level kind of\nstrategy working with uh board\ndirectors. I'm I'm a board director\nmyself of a of a sports partnership. Um,\nso it's it's, you know, putting together\nstrategy, uh, brand identities, all that\nkind of stuff all the way through to the\nday-to-day being at these events and\nhelping out. I mean, this is this is\nhelping out the um the guys at Bridgeale\nwere unable to to uh man the the event\nhere. So, I I kind of said, \"Yeah, I'm\nhappy to do it.\" So, and it's really\ngood because as a marketer, it gets\ngives me a chance to kind of speak to to\nriders like yourself and and just get to\nunderstand what you like, what you don't\nlike, what you want to see, what you\ndon't want to see. Um, because that's\nwhat marketing is. It's, you know, it's\nit's it's not about pushing products\nthat um, you know, people don't want.\nIt's generally it's not. Marketing is\nabout understanding what customers\nactually want and then making sure that\nthe the brands that they represent meet\nthat need. Um, so yeah, I mean that's\nkind of what I do in a nutshell. So,\nhey, if if you know, and I work with\nbrands, small, this is not a it's\nturning into an advert for my services.\nI don't mean it like that. Um, but yeah,\nI mean, I work with brands from startups\nall the way through to some of the big\nboys right across the world. So, yeah.\nUh, that's me in a nutshell. Uh, but,\nuh, yeah, it's good. It's varied. It's\nfun. Uh, and you get to meet really cool\npeople like you. Get to ride bikes, get\nto do events like Trans Rockies Classic.\nAmazing. Amazing. I'm biased. I'm a\nTrans Rockies ambassador and, uh, I\nactually love the guys over in Canada.\nUm, so yep, that's me. I'm going to shut\nup. I'm going to go and uh have a drink.\nNon-alcoholic drink. I'm in\ntraining. Which brings me on to one\nfinal thing before you fall asleep uh at\nmy waffle. Um some of my plans coming\nup. So, what am I doing? Um uh on the\nbike um and and uh in fitness. So, I've\ngot Hy Rocks coming up at the\nPrincipality in Cardiff at the end of\nMay. Uh so at time of uh recording\nthat's about 4 weeks away. Um and then\nin June uh I am doing a joining a\ncycling challenge for a cancer charity\ngoing the length of Wales along with San\nHelen uh from top to bottom all\noff-road. So that'll be fun. Uh I'm the\nonly non-ebike rider so I've got to try\nand keep up with a bunch of people on\nebikes. Um oh man. So it's it's the\nclimbing uh stats of Everest in a week\nand uh they've all got ebikes I haven't.\nSo, that's going to be an interesting\nweek, but it's all for a good cause and\nI can't wait. Um, lots of other good\nstuff. I'm racing the Grow in a couple\nof weeks\ntime. Uh, yeah, lots of stuff coming up.\nSo, stay tuned. Uh, I've waffled enough.\nI'm going to go I think the sun's got to\nme. I'm going to go and grab a\nnon-alcoholic drink and call it a night.\nSo, uh, yeah, join me again\ntomorrow. Quart 6. Uh, Saturday morning,\nday two. Uh, day one proper of the of\nthe event, I guess. And uh we're just\nsetting up. Um not really a lot going\non. Have a\nlook. The all important coffee place\nnext door to uh the Bridgeell tent is\nopen. And that's the main thing. I need\ncoffee. Um yeah, don't like getting up\nat 6:00 on a Saturday morning.\n[Music]\nJust the final call for riders for the\nrace briefing.\nThree, two, one, and go.\nThere we have it.\nSo that's it. So back to uh back to the\ngazebo for the next couple of hours till\nthe riders start coming back.\nSo, just set up for the final day on a\nfreezing cold morning. Seriously, my\nhands are numb. Uh, I'm not kidding. Uh,\nreally, really cold out there this\nmorning. Uh, in fact, show you the\nwindscreen on the van. Yeah, you see\nit's it's a it's a it's a cold one. Um,\nso yeah, it's it's been a good event so\nfar. Um, kind of just getting obviously\ngetting Bridge Dad out in front of uh a\ncrowd of riders is is good and and just\nkind of having a chat with riders and\nkind of getting feedback and all that\nkind of stuff. It's it's kind of\npriceless. So, uh, but yeah, man, I'm\ncold right now. So, uh, I'm going to go\nand get a coffee from the the lovely\nfolks at Pedal Power who do some pretty\npretty damn good coffee. I have to say.\nSo, if you're any of the Growla series\nand you see Pedal Powers Horsebox\nselling coffee, um, go and get some cuz\nI definitely recommend it. So, I'm going\nto shut up and I'm going to go and try\nand wake up and warm up. Um, so yeah, on\nto day three and then the pack down and\njourney home. So, the riders are just\ngetting ready to to head out on day\nthree or day two proper of racing, but\nday three of the event. Um, so I'll take\nyou outside and show you that in a\nsecond. Uh but yeah, we're just going to\nbe doing the rider briefing in the next\ncouple minutes. You may have heard that\nthey're just about to do the rider\nbriefing, but for\nnow, show you the glamorous behind the\nscenes. So, just lots of uh spot prizes\nfor the riders just been put aside\nthere. Um some other stuff for riders\nand for a couple of media people there.\ngoing to make your way to and then I'll\ntake you out here and show you what's\ngoing on.\n[Applause]\nroads. Expect the unexpected. Horse\nriders, walkers, other five, four, 3,\ntwo, one,\nand they're off.\nA slightly smaller field today on the\nday two. A couple sore heads from the\nlive music last night. Uh so now it's\ntime to the riders are off on day two,\ngrab another coffee and then pack up my\ntents and everything whilst it's quiet\nand uh wait for the riders to come back.\nSo, 3 hours or so later, riders are\ncoming back in now, which is uh good to\nsee. Some good times uh today. Uh I\nthink today's courses were a little bit\nshorter than uh than than yesterday's,\nbut still, you know, that's still going\nsome to get back in in that amount of\ntime. So, credit to them. So, uh yeah,\nlots of excitement. Um kind of kids\nwelcoming their their parents home from\nfrom the rides and everything. So that's\nalways cool to see. Uh it's good to see\nkids getting involved in in the sport at\nthis level um an early age. So yeah,\nthat's kind of it now. So plan now is to\njust kind of hang around and uh chat to\nas many people as I can. I've spent the\nlast few hours kind of chatting to the\nother industry bods, kind of milling\naround\num and and really just catching up. Uh\nbut uh but yeah, so do a little bit of\nwork now and and chat to to some more of\nyou guys and uh and if you were here\nthis weekend, then hopefully um you you\nstopped by. Uh if not, please do next\ntime. But um yeah, it's been it's been a\nreally good weekend. So So yeah, so a\nfew hours now. I think we got about\nanother 6 hours or so. Um and uh cuz we\nwill be here until the last rider\nleaves. Um and uh yeah, then it'll be\ntime to pack up and do the 5-hour\njourney home. So, uh, I'll shut up for\nnow. It's been a pleasure. Hopefully,\nyou've got something out of this video.\nNot quite sure what, but, um, yeah, lots\nof stuff coming. Uh, Hy Rocks, um, the\ncharity ride through the length of\nWales, uh, the Grow, lots of of cool\nstuff coming and loads of new bike\ncontent as well. I've got some new bikes\nto to show you, including a rather nice\n3T, which I'm really proud of. I love\nthat thing already. Um, so yeah, until\nnext time, stay safe. Bye for now."
