      "description": "Come ride along with me as I ride the 'Impulso' (shorter) distance in the Nanaimo Unpaved Gravel race. I don't subscribe to Strava, so I was relying on the course markers. Even though the course was marked well, I questioned if I had made a wrong turn. This race is part of the Trek Gravel Series, hosted by Panache Cycling on Mosaic's forestry roads. This race had three distances, and the largest was the 'Esperto' route at 110 km and 2084 m of elevation. Feedback on this route was that it was the hardest gravel fondo for many. The other distance was the 'Intermedio' at 67 km with 1079 m of elevation and the shorter 'Impulso' route, which I rode, at 42 km with 890 m of elevation. I enjoy participating in races, even though they are very challenging for me. I try to encourage others to take part just for fun, for a challenge, and to enjoy the experience . As I mentioned many times in the video, I ride for cookies! \n#vancouverisland #gravelbiking #gravelracing #fitnesslifestyle #gravelcycling #cyclingrace #canadalife #specializedbikes #bicycle",
