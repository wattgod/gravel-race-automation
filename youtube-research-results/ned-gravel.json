      "description": "Last Saturday we took the opportunity to ride the first climbing section of the Ned Gravel Course in July. This section is rough. It opens with a 3.5 mile climb up 1500ft of loose gravel with baby head sized rocks. That climb tops out at 10050ft above sea level, and features hike-a-bike sections through 3+ feet deep snow.\n\nThe first short descent was a bit of a creek with appropriate levels of sketchiness and rocks.\n\nThe second descent is the kind of thing we all climb for: 5 miles down 2200ft across smooth, fast, forest surrounded gravel.\n\nClimb 2 and 3 were a bit disheartening. While the conditions were better than the first, and the grade lower, the return to high elevation really took it's tole our legs.\n\nThe final descent starts just shy of 10000 feet and is covered with patches of melting snow, run off, and mud. But once you're past the slop, it's a high speed gravel free for all.\n\nThat race is going to be nuts!\n\n#milehighgravelpunx",

      "description": "Here's some of the Ned Gravel race from 7/31/2021.  I rode this one with my brother Paul (Orange Helmet)  and we rode the Tungsten course.  Fun event more suited to a mountain bike in my opinion due to the Switzerland jeep road portion.  The video is kinda long, but one gets the flavor of the event, but is only 1:19 hours of what took us almost 6 to complete.  The full rocky Switzerland descent is at about the  49 minute mark or some such.\n\nShot this on the Insta 360 one X and the final rendering was done with Davnci Resolve.",
