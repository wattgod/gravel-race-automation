      "description": "The Noosa Enduro has a place in Australia's mountain bike history, as a long-running event in the beautiful Noosa Hinterland. While it slipped off the event calendar for a decade, the Noosa Enduro came back with a bang in 2021, and the event became a weekend of off-road cycling with gravel events on the Sunday after the mountain bike events on Saturday.\n\nFind out more: https://www.noosaenduro.com.au/\n\nWith the return of the popular event in 2022, the event team have really gone full gas, with more event distance options.

      "transcript": "[Music]\nhey there mike from amb we're up here\npreviewing the noosa enduro course\nthat's on later this year on the 30th of\njuly it's a it's a marathon race that's\nbeen around for a very long time it runs\nup in the noosa hinterland but it's back\nit started again in 2021 and on the 30th\nof july 2022 it takes to the trails\nagain starting at tawanton which is\nwhere we are right now now tackling a\nmarathon event like the new student\nbureau isn't something that most people\nshould do off the couch\nso we've got anna beck with us who's a\nb's fitness guru so she's going to be\ntaking us through some of the key\nsections of the trails and maybe what\nyou should do to make sure you can get\nthrough the event in one piece and have\na great day\nfor 2022 there are three courses to\nchoose from you've got a 30k event which\nis a nice introductory level uh distance\nthat you can do then there's the 60k\nevent it's going to take you a little\nbit further into the noosa hinterland or\nthe main event which is the 100k race\nthat's what we're going to look at today\nover the 100 kilometer course it's quite\na demanding course\nin terms of the distance that you need\nto cover but it's also really scenic\ncourse too you get out into the nursery\nhint land go through lots of the the\nvillages there great views to the ocean\nplus you get to ride a lot of the single\ntracker to wanton too\nthe nursery enduro course while it\nstarts nice and flat around the tawonton\nedges we actually do climb up a fair bit\nwe've got a lot of climbing in the\nmidsection of the course\nand then some extra climbing thrown in\ntowards the end before we head back here\npacing and strategy is key to making the\nmost out of it it'll make those end of\nrace beers taste even sweeter\none great thing about the new student\nenduro on 30th of july is that it does\ncreate a perfect weekend to get away up\nto the beautiful sunshine coast and lose\nthe hinterland area if you want to\nescape a cold winter from down south and\nto match with that there's also the\nnoosa gravel race on the sunday and it's\neven the national championships this\nyear so\nbring one bike bring two come up for a\nweekend and escape the cold southern\nwinter\nso the first few k's of the noosa enduro\nno matter what distance you're doing you\nare coming out on these flatter trails a\nlot of double track and pieces of single\ntrack just chill at this point you've\ngot plenty of racing to come uh if\npeople are getting in front of you\nthat's all good there's some really big\nhills coming once you get to the\nhinterland and you want to keep your\nstrength there so at about 5k in or a\nlittle bit more you start heading into\nsome of the flat single track on the way\nout of towanton\nhere you might change your strategy from\nhow you're riding for the nursery enduro\ni'd make sure you keep a bit of a\ndistance off the rider in front give\nyourself two or three bike lengths so\nyou don't get uh caught up behind any\nmistakes that they make we come through\npomona into the first checkpoint and\nthen head into the tukachoy forest\naround mount karora now this is where\nthings start to get a bit spicy with\nsome short sharp climbs but make sure\nnot to use all your biscuits up here\nbecause we've got some even bigger ones\nonce we pop out the other side of the\nforest so if you're coming through the\nspeed zone make sure you have plenty of\nhydration take something to eat keep\nyourself on track for having smiles at\nthe end\nall right so\nso much of the nissa trail network is a\nton of fun and just like swooping\nthrough some of the trees on on these\nmulti-use trails and old forest roads\nbut\nthe climbs are still steep so\nyou know take it in your stride don't\nget upset if you got to get off the wall\nbecause trust me people at the front of\nthe race will be too\nso in about last 20k or so you're coming\nback through the noosa trail network\nit's a whole network of trails that\nconnect a lot of the townships in the\nnoosa hinterland it's pretty special\ncountry that you come through it's on\nthe foothills as you're going up to the\nto the hinterland so you're descending\nback down going through these rainforest\ngullies uh there's a lot of older\nforestry works here so you can see the\nremnants of old bridges old logging\ntracks and and sneak tracks but you can\nalso see the great regrowth that's\nhappening and enjoy the cool air in the\nforest\nso the nursery enduro should be on your\nmust ride list for events for 2022.\nyou've got the 100 kilometer distance\nthe 60 or the 30. from what we've seen\nover the 100k course today it's it's a\nreally varied route that you're going to\nget a full experience of riding in the\nnoosa area we're up still up here on the\nhinterland but we've been on single\ntrack in tawantan we've been on\nrainforest trails we've been on country\nforest roads it's been a whole lot of\nfun so choose your challenge the 30k 60\nor even the 100k race and come and\nexperience all that noosa has to offer\nfrom the trails to the beach it's going\nto be a great weekend of riding with the\ntwo days of two days of events mixed\nwith the mountain biking on saturday and\nthe gravel race on the sunday and it's a\nperfect reason to come up to this corner\nof queensland and a beautiful part of\nthe world on the 30th of july so don't\nmiss it"

      "description": "What an incredible weekend at the Noosa Enduro!\n\nMaxxis was proud to be a key partner of the event, supporting riders as they tackled the beautiful and varied terrain of the Noosa Hinterland.\nOver the two days, we saw more than 1,000 competitors take part, ranging in age from 7 to 80, making it one of the most inclusive and family-friendly Gravel/Enduro events on the calendar.\n  \nThroughout the weekend, it was rewarding to hear firsthand how Maxxis tyres performed out on the course. It\u2019s clear we remain a go-to choice for riders looking to conquer diverse and demanding gravel routes.\n \nBeyond the ride, the Enduro Village was full of energy, with live music, delicious food, and an incredible community atmosphere.\n  \nUnder the giant Maxxis tent in the event village, our friendly crew had the chance to connect with riders, chatting about all things MTB and Gravel, and help people find their perfect Maxxis tyre combo.\n \nWe also handed out over 150 swag bags to those who stopped by and scanned the code on our giveaway A-frame out front.\n  \nAs always, we brought along informative and interactive signage, this time with a big focus on educating riders about our new HYPR-X compound tyre range. With hands-on product displays and our expert team available for questions, riders had everything they needed to learn more about Maxxis\u2019 quality and innovation.\n  \nWe also made sure our tent was a space where riders could get real support. In partnership with a local Queensland bike shop Venture Cycles, we offered event-only tyre deals and a special Maxxis Race Service, where competitors could purchase their preferred tyres and have them fitted by our team, free of charge. It was a hit and hugely appreciated by riders getting ready to race.\n \nTo top it all off, our team had the honour of joining the podium presentation, awarding Maxxis prizes to over 40 well-deserved podium finishers.\n \nWe\u2019re already counting down to next year\u2019s event and can\u2019t wait to continue backing the gravel community with the best tyres and support in the game.",

      "description": "A great challenge to complete. It was a doozy!! Hectic hills, which the GoPro footage doesn't do justice, and downhills too, fast single track, cow paddocks, dirt roads, mud pits...also, some of the best scenery in the Noosa hinterland. A sunrise start, then it took me 7 1/2 hours (7:32) to complete. Such a great event and so well organised.",
