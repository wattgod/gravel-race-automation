      "transcript": "Good day, trends setters. Presenting to\nyou today a quick video, the bikes of\nNova Aoya, an event I attended recently\nin the beautiful Tuscan town of Ban\nVento, Italy. Don't forget to check out\nthe event video itself. It's linked in\nthe description below. These are bikes I\ncaptured before and during the event.\nLet's go. The Yanki Arcadeex.\nIt's nice bike.\nThank you. Nice vit. Thank you very\nmuch. Pretty explorer. Lots of bags on\nboard.\nTrick checkpoint. The Americano project.\nCube or is it Cubay? I don't know.\nDude's running a GoPro on the front and\nit's a rival one by drive with a huge\nafter set on the back. BNC road bike.\nOkay. Very narrow tires. Gago\nMono GX 2MO\nSilk\nZip 303 Explores\nand that's a mechanical build.\nCool bike here. Dorti, which is Italian.\nIt's a steel bike including the steel\nfork\napex mechanical\none buy\nfactor factor very nice copyright lots\nof bags on board that's okay with\nshampex one buy huge cassette huge chain\nring\nvery nice this is Scott. I don't know\nthe model. Might be a speedster of some\nkind, but it's pretty much shovel road\ntires, two by\nRival Force\ncombination. Triban. I think that's a\ndecathlon brand\none by\ngroup set. What is that? I think it's\nmicro shift. Yes, it is.\nAnd then we have the tech gear Italian.\nThis is aluminium\ntram Apex one by\nthen a Scott\ncheckpoint with the metal kind of\nclassic wheels. Very nice.\nAnd a very cool Canondell over here.\nSuper X\nFocus Atlas. That isn't a brand you see\nin the United States very often\nnowadays. The brand is no longer\nimportant unfortunately.\nThat's a big frame. The guy is obviously\nquite tall with a one by\nelectronic explore. Looks like rival\nfrom this. Yes, it is rival. 10 to 44%.\nCanondelle topstone lefty.\nora\nterror.\nNot the latest version. They just\nlaunched a new bike, but it's fitted\nwith GRX 2 by mechanical Simonini. Simon\nsee steel\ncarbon\nand one by with GRX redet\npark prey. That is, I think, an American\nbrand, but I haven't seen it in a long,\nlong time. I don't even know if it's an\nAmerican brand anymore.\nConsider that with Tram Apex mechanical\nmix, I've seen a lot of two buys and\nsome one buys. Not as prolific as in the\nUnited States, the one buys. That's a\nreally nice Bianke Arcade X. Love the\ncolorway. It's like a copper color. Very\nsweet.\n[Music]\nTristina Yana. I reviewed the first\ngeneration of that bike a long time ago.\nI didn't know the brand of this bike,\nbut it's pretty neat. Huge tires.\nVictoria May's car, which is a mountain\nbike. 2.2 by 29.\nYeah. Very nice. Which brand? The brand.\nKona. Oh, Kona. Bicycles. Okay. Okay.\nGlad. It's a Canadian brand. Yeah. See,\nsee with ShraMM mechanical one by the\nnice low chamber ring. Good luck\nexplorer Italia version. That's an\nexpensive bike.\nCanyon\nvintage Bianke. Possibly the coolest\nbike here. Very nice.\nOkay. Yeah. Yeah. See, see. Yeah. Yeah.\nGood luck.\nBeautiful geos right there.\nFull on road bike.\nPoland road bike\nred. You never see this brand in the\nstun.\nThe original OG mechanical speed.\nVery cool. Dropper climb mountain bike.\nVery nice.\nRight, transetters. I hope you enjoyed\nthat quick look at a few of the bikes I\nmanaged to capture from the 2025 Nova\nAOA. As always, thank you for watching.\nIf you haven't already, please consider\nsubscribing to the Gravel Cycles YouTube\nchannel for interesting content such as\nthis, no gravel bike reviews,\nother product reviews, ride experience\nvideos, and of course, one of my\nfavorite things in life, general\nmadness. Red key or the black key? Oh,\ncome on, mate. Red key wins every time.\nClutch pedal in.\nWhat the am I doing with my life?\nActually, I just recalled it's pretty\nbloody awesome. We'll see you in the\nnext video."
