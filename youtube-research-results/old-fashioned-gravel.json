      "description": "This is the first paved climb for the 2025 USAC Gravel Nationals, up Ridgeview Road. The climb starts about eight miles in to the route, just southwest of Hokah. The climb itself is just over a mile in distance, and ~350 feet in elevation change. The gravel begins at the top of the climb, as you hit the township line. Video here is from Sept 13, 2025 at the Old Fashioned Gravel event; there had been some light sprinkles just that morning, so the asphalt is damp. https://ridewithgps.com/routes/51956892?highlight=460-553",

      "transcript": "many people think that pressing the gas\npedal too hard in low gears is the only\ndanger of spinning a rear wheeel drive\ncar but to be honest that's only one\npart of the truth in this video I reveal\nother at least equally risky behaviors\nand situations that you absolutely need\nto know and master if you want to drive\nspiritedly and safely on the road or\nracetrack without ending up in the guard\nrail a friend and I had a conversation\nabout these things recently and he was\nwas so surprised that he thought it\ncould be really helpful for others and\ndon't worry I'll explain everything step\nby step in a way that's easy to\nunderstand so that you're guaranteed to\nget it even with little or no prior\nknowledge so let's start with situation\none a mistake that even experienced\ndrivers sometimes make letting off the\ngas in a corner at high\nRPM this phenomenon is known among\ndriving enthusiasts as liftoff over\nsteer a quick explanation for viewers\nwho are not familiar over steer means\nthat the rear axle Slips\nAway under steer is the exact opposite\nmeaning the front axle begins to slip\nand the car steers\nless so what happens during liftoff over\nsteer you're driving through through a\ncurve quickly and giving it some gas\nthen you let off the gas sounds\nunspectacular right but suddenly your\nrear has more energy than a toddler\nafter a double espresso and wants to go\neverywhere except where you want but why\nlet's take a closer look at what happens\nas soon as you lift off the gas engine\nbraking kicks in at high RPM it's\nespecially strong this causes two things\nto happen on one hand the grip of the\ntires on the rear axle is challenged\nafter all they are the ones in rear\nwheeel drive cars that transmit the\nbraking power from the engine on the\nother hand the deceleration shifts the\nweight forward you can clearly feel the\neffect of weight transfer when you break\nhard on a bicycle it pulls your upper\nbody forward and maybe even lifts the\nrear wheel in the car the rear axle is\nrelieved in the same way by the engine\nbrake so the rear tires are pressed less\nagainst the asph\nand therefore have less grip this means\nwe have a very unfavorable combination\non one hand the grip of the rear tires\ndecreases on the other hand we demand\nmore grip from these tires due to engine\nbraking imagine each wheel of your car\nhas its own account with grip points\nit's a very simplified model but let's\nsay the tire offers 100 points when\nbreaking accelerating or cornering you\nuse the points and divide them between\nbreak breaking accelerating and\ncornering if we demand as many or fewer\ngrip points as the tire can deliver all\nis well for example 100 points only for\naccelerating when going straight or when\naccelerating in a corner 60 points for\nthe corner and 40 points for accelerator\nif we ask for more points because we\nsteer more or accelerate more for\nexample 50 for acceleration and 60 for\ncornering then the tire throws a\nspontaneous sliding part party here's\nwhat happens with the grip points during\nliftoff over steer before you lift off\nthe gas your rear tires Point account is\nfull you have 100 grip points you use 70\npoints for cornering and 15 points for\nslight acceleration that makes 85 points\nso 15 points are not used but then you\ndecide to lift off the gas suddenly your\npoint account feels like it partied all\nnight reduced from 100 to 85 points\nbecause the party crowd I mean the\nweight moved\nforward now with only 85 grip points\nleft and you're still trying to take the\ncurve with the same intensity while the\nengine brake demands even more points\nyou're in a sort of points overdraft\nit's like booking a luxury vacation with\nyour credit card even though the account\nsays please don't or in simple terms if\nyou're confused by the points Theory the\nrear tires have less grip but have to\ntransmit more forces than before result\nyour rear breaks out by the way the\nnumbers are exemplary to explain the\nprinciple please don't pin me down on\nthe exact numbers did you know on the\nnurburg ring Nord schlier the longest\nand most dangerous racetrack in the\nworld there are some spots particularly\nknown for liftoff over steer like Shen\nor the left turn at the entrance to\nadenau Forest so what can you do to\navoid liftoff over steer\nthe best thing is of course not to\nsuddenly let off the gas in a corner if\nI must let off the gas in a corner for\nwhatever reasons then I try to let off\nthe gas as gently as possible to make\nthe car's reaction more controlled open\nthe steering\nslightly and be ready to counter steer\ndirectly in case of over steer all of\nthis requires practice and reflex like\nreactions hence it's best for not so\nexperienced drivers to drive defense L\nand not let it get that far let's jump\nstraight to point two because you can\nsee many drivers making this mistake in\ntheir daily driving and under\nunfavorable circumstances it will cost\nyou your car but before we continue I\nhave a request for you if you've liked\nthe video so far please give us a like\nit's like applause but you don't even\nhave to take your hands off the wheel uh\nkeyboard this way more people learn\nabout the video and might become better\ndrivers thank you shifting down in a\ncurve this maneuver is particularly\nchallenging in cars with a manual\ntransmission but also in older automatic\ntransmissions that do not automatically\nprovide a Charming blip of the throttle\nwhen downshifting but let's start from\nthe beginning imagine you're driving\nquickly through a bend in the curve you\nrealize you're in too high a gear to\naccelerate well after the curve so you\ndownshift that means means you disengage\nthe clutch select the lower gear for\nexample from third to second gear and\nlet the clutch back in what could\npossibly go wrong in fact your car can\nbehave like a teenager who has had their\nWi-Fi turned off let's take a look under\nthe hood assuming you were in third gear\nat 2,500 revolutions per minute during\nthe gear change the RPM drops to a\nrelaxed 1,500 revolutions per minute but\nin the lower gear the engine jumps to\n4,200 revolutions per minute this means\nthe RPM has to increase by a whopping\n2,700 revolutions per minute let's see\nwhat the grip points have to say about\nthis before the shifting maneuver there\nwere a full 100 points in your rear\ntires account because the RPM has to\nincrease the engine exerts an even\nstronger braking effect on the rear axle\nand thus a stronger weight transfer than\nduring liftoff off over steer instead of\n100 grip points the rear tire has only\n80 grip points due to the weight\ntransfer 60 grip points are used for\ncornering and 25 points for the stronger\nsudden engine breake that's a total of\n85 which is Five Points more than the\ntire can handle and the rear breaks out\nor in simple terms if you're confused by\nthe points Theory the rear tires have\nless grip but have to transmit more\nforces than before what can we do to\navoid this situation and make our\ndriving more\ncontrolled the obvious thing is simply\nnot to shift in the\ncurve if you know beforehand which gear\nyou need it's best to engage it before\nthe curve if you don't know the optimal\ngear in advance you could wait to\ndownshift until you're out of the curve\nbut that's super boring and you're\nprobably not here to drive like old\ngranny the Sporter method is to blip the\nthrottle this means that you briefly\npress the accelerator when engaging the\nclutch to bring the engine up to the\nhigher RPM for the lower gear how dare\nyou this means that the tires don't have\nto do it and there is no breaking effect\nthat triggers weight transfer this is\nwhy race and R drivers and manual cars\nMaster the driving technique heel and\ntoe perfectly so with the right foot you\ncan operate not just one but two pedals\nthen you can break clutch and blip the\nthrottle simultaneously ly to sum up\nthis point it's best if you treat\nshifting in a curve like your ex better\nnot to be in immediate proximity and\ndefinitely not under stress or more\nseriously put avoid shifting in curves\nespecially into lower gears optionally\npractice blipping the throttle and if\nyou're really serious heel and\ntoe I'll explain the next Point more\nbriefly since it's based on the same\nprinciples as points one and two however\nthis time it's not about letting off the\ngas I just remembered I should add\nsomething not all the situations or\ndriving errors mentioned in the video\nlead to the rear breaking out 100% of\nthe time under ideal conditions and if\nyou're slow your car will drive as if on\nRails even with minor driving errors but\nremember even the Titanic was Unsinkable\nuntil it wasn't it's this deceptive\nsecurity that's dangerous it is also\nimportant to note that not all car\nmodels react exactly the same way to\ncertain\nsituations my goal is for you to sharpen\nyour awareness with this video because\nas soon as one or even several critical\nfactors come into play the likelihood of\nthe rear breaking out increases such\nfactors include sportier speed jerky\nsteering fast Direction Change known\nfrom the Moose\ntest a crest\nworn tires on the rear axle in wet\nconditions poor Road surface wetness\nleaves snow or ice steep downhill heavy\nload in the trunk these are at least the\nfactors that come to my mind\nspontaneously if you know more it would\nbe great if you could write a comment so\nthat other drivers and I can learn from\nit thank\nyou okay now we really come to point\nthree breaking hard in a curve at high\nRPM imagine you're driving through a\ncurve again at high RPM and off the gas\nthen you suddenly hit the brakes and the\nrear end becomes unsettled or even snaps\nout why is\nthat the grip points also help us to\nunderstand what is happening here 55 out\nof 100 grip points on the rear axle are\nused for the curve 15 grip points for\nthe tire to transmit the effect of the\nengine\nbrake now you break and the car's weight\nshifts forward think back to the\nexperiment with the bicycle so the grip\non the rear axle decreases significantly\nin the example of liftoff over steer the\ngrip had reduced from 100 to\n85 however we're breaking additionally\nin this new case so the weight shifts\neven more let's assume that the grip\npoints reduced to 75 this time the curve\nstill needs 55 points and the engine\nbrake 15 plus we've also used the normal\nbrake which also acts on the rear axle\nit needs let's say 10 points that's a\ntotal of 80 so the tires are five points\nover the limit and lose their grip\nsimilar to how I lose my self-control at\nthe cheese counter I'm not joking I'm\nreally not if you're confused by all the\npoints here it is in normal words the\nengine brake and the normal brake shift\nthe weight strongly to the front so that\nthe tires have less grip at the rear\nhowever the engine brake and normal\nbrake also put more strain on these\ntires which means they are over strained\nthe scenario could also be the other way\naround you break what the tires can\nstill handle despite the weight transfer\nthen you steer more sharply and the\ntires can no longer handle breaking and\ncornering together to avoid this\ndramatic experience here's a tip treat\nbreaking in a curve like adding salt to\nyour favorite dish a little can enhance\nthe flavor too much ruins everything in\nthe next and final section I have an\nexercise for you for exactly this\npurpose if it is necessary to break\nharder in a bend the driver can diffuse\nthe situation in a similar way to that\ndescribed for the liftoff over steer\nbreak as gently as possible to make the\ncar's reaction more\ncontrolled open the steering slightly\nand be ready to counter steer directly\nin case of over\nsteer in extreme situations you can also\npress the clutch in manual cars so that\nthe critical braking effect on the rear\naxle is eliminated the fourth and final\npoint is probably the most well-known\nbut I want to mention an essential\ndriving technique for you too much gas\nand low gears in a\ncurve I think I don't need to explain\nwhat happens here do you remember the\nmovie Back to the Future as much as we\nlove it when you step on the gas\nunfortunately no flux compensator will\nmake you travel through time in instead\nyou might end up in a time where you\nhave to call the tow truck because the\ntire has to transfer more torque than\nits grip allows it Slips Away the more\npower a car has the lower the gear and\nthe more throttle you apply the more\nlikely it is to happen how can you deal\nwith it let's think back to the grip\npoints model where the tire only has 100\npoints so it can't provide 100 points\nfor steering and 100 points for\nacceleration at the same same time the\nmore you open up the steering the more\ngrip points the tire has purely for\nacceleration without slipping let's see\nhow it looks in real\nlife here's a mental trick you can use\nas long as the interaction between\nthrottle and steering is not an\nunconscious routine for you imagine an\ninvisible string between the bottom of\nthe steering wheel and the gas pedal the\nmore you return the steering wheel to\nthe normal position the more the string\nallows you to press the gas pedal down\nthis technique has another Advantage if\nyou slowly press the gas the weight of\nthe vehicle can shift to the back\nallowing the tires to build more grip\nthe idea with the string also works for\nbraking the more you steer the more you\nhave to release the brake pedal you can\npractice this process with low speed and\nlittle braking pressure on any curve in\neveryday life it really helps to build\nup this\nhabit let's summarize this in four\ngolden rules one be careful when you let\noff the gas in a curve at high\nRPM two shift into a lower gear before\nthe curve not in the curve three the\nmore you break the less you can steer or\nvice versa the more you steer the less\nyou can break this is especially true at\nhigh RPM four only press the gas as much\nas you open the steering especially in\nlow gears or cars with a lot of power I\nhope you enjoyed watching and ideally\nlearned something new and if you think\nhey I already knew all that fantastic\nshare your knowledge and experiences in\nthe comments so we can all get even\nbetter but wait before you switch off I\nhave one more request this video was\ncompletely free for you and came with\nmore safety instructions than an\nairplane takeoff if you liked it please\nleave a like and a comment so more\npeople can become better drivers if you\ndon't want to miss any more videos from\nme I would be very very happy about a\nsubscription\ncheers"

If you've never tried AS6,\nexpect a smooth, supportive ride with\nsecure heel fit and longlasting comfort.\nIt's different from brands like Nike or\nHoka because it's more structured, more\nstable, and made to go the distance. The\nNimbus 27 is built for max comfort, so\nsuper soft, plush, and protective. It's\nperfect for long or recovery runs. And\nif you're all about feeling good, this\nis honestly your cloud ride. And I have\nthe black gray color. The Cumulus 27 is\nyour reliable everyday trainer. It's\nbalanced, smooth, and versatile. It's\ngreat for easy runs, even errands, or\nanything in between. Now, the Nova Blast\n5. This one's light, bouncy, and has a\ngreat energy return. It's great for\ndaily training, long runs, and even\ntempo sessions. I recommend it for\nrunners who want a fun, energetic ride\nthat can still handle volume. A quick\nheads up, these aren't carbon plated\nrace shoes, but I will say that the Nova\nBlus 5 is light and responsive enough to\nrace a 5K, 10K, or even a half. If you\nwant one shoe for training and race day,\nand I have the grayish\npurple/coral color, if you want pure\nsoftness and comfort, then go for the\nNimbus 27 for your easy runs or long\nruns. If you want an everyday trainer\nwith a traditional feel, then go for the\nCumulus 27. If you want bounce and a\nfast feel in a traditional trainer, then\ngo for the Nova Blast"
