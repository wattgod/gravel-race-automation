racers and just show you the scene\nof gravel racing\nall right guys i'm still in my\nhotel room getting ready to go down get\nsome breakfast from the lobby\nyou know it's uh below freezing here\nwe're not used to that\nin mississippi i'm not in south\nmississippi anymore i'm up towards\noxford mississippi for race number one\nof the mississippi gravel cup uh\nordinary epics\njason and wendy shear do an awesome job\nputting on this race series and my\nbicycle shop um biloxi bicycle works is\none of the uh one of the sponsors this\nyear so i'm i'm proud to be part of\nthat whole thing\num\nwe'll see how racing goes today i had a\ndream that i was\nracing don garlits a drag racer last\nnight so kind of a cool to have dream\nlike that and then get an opportunity\ntoday to you know raise some of the\nfastest guys in this region um\ni think all you guys know i've been i've\nbeen working in the bicycle shop so much\ni haven't had that much time to train\nbut sometimes it's not about thinking\nabout what you haven't done it's\nthinking about what you're gonna do and\ni'm looking forward to seeing everybody\nout there on the start line and uh\nyou know hammering down and just seeing\nwhat we could do out there it's it's\ngonna be some tough conditions it's\nwindy and it's cold and we're not used\nto that i usually don't have to wear\nthis much clothes and i don't even think\nthat this is enough but\ni didn't have much time to repair or\nprepare so i just threw some stuff in a\nbag and here we are i'm going to take\nyou guys with me and we'll we'll see\nwhat happens out there all right guys\nmississippi gravel cup race number one\noxford mississippi ordinary epics this\nis exciting it's gonna be a blast\nlast year\nit\ngravel is all kinds of little ones\nforeign\nthank you\nso\nit's freaking awesome\nall right man that's the way to go\nwater\nbeing chased down by\ntracy brooks and bart luther from\nthere's nothing easy about that man\nnothing easy\nbut you guys were rolling too man\noh dude\nyeah\noh yeah i saw you\nwell hey everybody bart with bicycle\nrider youtube we are uh gonna do a quick\nlittle race recap uh um race number one\noxford mississippi mississippi gravel\ncup 2022\njanuary\ngravel race scene has started race\nnumber one is in the books and it was a\nfantastic time to be had by all of\ncourse we um you know we started off\nthat morning below freezing in\nmississippi uh you know we've got a\nlittle bit of humidity here in\nmississippi so you know those kind of\nnumbers maybe in other states don't seem\nthat cold but in mississippi that that\ncold gets to you but uh you know with\nthe 200 people on the starting line for\nthe 50-mile race which is is what i did\num you know once you get up there that\nadrenaline is kicking and you don't\nreally think about the cold oh you\nactually embrace it and it's just part\nof the race so\nonce again they make some awesome cold\nweather gear nowadays so you know having\nthe right the right gear definitely\nhelps\nmy fingers did get a little cold in the\nbeginning but it wasn't wasn't long we\nforgot all about that but you know the\nskies broke\nthe sun came out i think that afternoon\nit was like 50 something degrees and it\nwas glorious so sometimes you know you\ncan't always look at the weather reports\nand kind of gauge your race just show up\nno matter what the weather's doing and\ncome out and race it's a blast so and\nthat's what we did we had a good time um\ni did get some some numbers oh shoot i\ndon't know what i did with my sticky\nnote let me go from the top of my head\nuh i believe in the 50-mile category we\nhad over 150 people you know signed up\nfor that of course they split that in\ndifferent age groups i i um i was in the\nmaster's category so i'm age 46 to\n59. um of course i'm 52 years old so you\nknow i'm i'm i'm getting up there in\nthat age group but uh you know it was\nreally good we did a mass start so you\ndon't really know who you're racing with\nas far as you know your age groups and\nstuff but a mass start is thrilling\nmaybe you saw some of the footage i did\nput a little gopro hero 6 on my on my\ncamera on my handlebar so that's how we\ngot some of that footage um\nout of the 150 people that we started\nwith i finished up 26. so i was pretty\nhappy about that\nin my age group or the masters category\ni finished seventh place out of\ni believe 51.\nso once again i you know top 10 i'm i'm\nhappy with that you know to tell you the\ntruth i love hitting a podium um i get a\nlittle bit disappointed in myself when i\ndon't but you know i'm looking at the\nthe\nyou know just the racers we have out\nthere and the fitness levels and you\nknow i'm uh you know now that i own a\nbicycle shop i don't have as much time\nto train as i used to so i'm not making\nexcuses but what i am doing is i'm\ntrying to learn how to you know have\nmore fun with racing um a lot of it is\njust being out there being part of that\ncommunity you know uh for me it's it's\nit's meeting\nnew people and\nseeing the people i sold bikes to and\nhelp gear and and seeing those people\nout there with their families having a\ngood time and enjoying it so you know\nsometimes when you're when you're\ngrowing a scene growing a community you\ncan't be as selfish with your own\ntraining you know i do have to lead a\nlot of you know beginner gravel rides\nand intermediate gravel ride stuff like\nthat to help help people in cycling so\nthat takes away from some of my time\nthat i would have for for more high-end\ntraining um and i'm not complaining i'm\njust getting used to it so uh you know\nthose days of me\nyou know\nexpecting to hit every podium that i\nenter is i think those days are gone um\nbut i am learning to have fun with it\nand i'm definitely not complaining about\nbeing you know seventh place uh a\nfinisher with with that level of racing\nand and the thing is we had fun doing it\nyou know i got dropped off the front\ngroup right away you probably saw that\nin the camera um\nbut when i did get with it with a group\nthat i thought i could stick with that\nwe made a slight navigation area and a\ncouple of guys escape from us and that's\njust part of racing i'm happy for those\nguys that that escaped and and then i\ngot hooked up with a really cool group\num one guy tracy brooks out of uh out of\nlouisiana i'd never met him in person\nbut i talked to him several times on the\nphone so actually getting to meet him\nand ride with him you'll see him towards\nthe end of the race come around me at\nthe finish line for an awesome sprint so\ncongratulations tracy man you did great\nbut some of the other group i hooked up\nwith was the from from 901 racing out of\nmemphis and i don't know a lot of those\nguys personally but you know racing with\nhim was awesome i didn't get a chance to\ntalk to him after the race much because\nwe were looking for a set of keys that\nwe couldn't find but i hope to get to\nknow those guys a little bit better um\nthe guys and girls it was a really\nstrong girl i think her name was allison\num and and i don't know that was a great\ngroup of people to ride with it just\nshowed the camaraderie of gravel we were\ncalling out potholes for each other we\nwere working together\nwe ran into a velovic guy and picked him\nup and he was super strong\num so i have to catch that guy's name\nand thank him for you know for pulling\nus down the racecourse a little bit but\nyou know the overwhelming feeling after\ngravel race was it was excitement was\nenergetic was about community it wasn't\nall about who hit podiums and\ncongratulations to the you guys that did\nhit podiums that was that was a beast of\na race course you know was fun had a lot\nof character but it really took the\nenergy out of me at 50 miles so those\nguys that did 100 miles oh my gosh\ncongratulations man and anybody that did\nhit a podium all mean you did it\nhonestly it's it's awesome to do that\nbut i think all of us are in the same\nboat that it's it's more about\ncamaraderie out there about pushing your\npersonal fitness goals um about about\njust just seeing what you can do\nsome people are doing it for for the\nscenic ride i mean it is absolutely\nbeautiful out there and i think each one\nof our race courses has a\nyou know a really special you know\nbeauty to it so our next race is going\nto be in camp shelby out of hattiesburg\nmississippi that's only about an hour\naway from where i live and and biloxi\nbicycle works my bicycle shop is going\nto be you know doing support for that\nrace so we're actually going to be up\nthere this weekend coming up for a\nshakedown of the racecourse so we'll see\nhow that goes i'll bring a camera with\nme and hopefully i'll have some people\nto help with with camera gear and stuff\num speaking of uh you might see that i\ntried to get fancy and i i spliced some\nvideo together i even put a little bit\nof text up there like when heath was\ndropping his bottle or when we made that\nnavigation area\nnavigation error um\nit's it's\nnot easy for me to edit uh because when\ni'm looking at the edits the the text\ndidn't come in the right spot um i tried\nto add some music and when i looked at\nthe final cut the music wasn't on there\nso so i'm struggling with some of that\nstuff but i did want to get a cool\nlittle video out um i think i will also\njust make a video of all the the ride\nfootage i got from my handlebars\ni'm not gonna\nadd music and text and all that stuff\nbut it might be something cool just to\nput in the the background we're gonna\nuse it at the bicycle shop you know put\nin the background of the bicycle shop\nbut uh i'll throw that out there and see\nwhere we go i'll keep working on these\nvideos and i'm gonna try to get a little\ndocumentary of all four races in this\nseries so uh stick with uh stick with us\ni'll get better at what i'm doing as far\nas trying to make some some creative\nvideos and if i you know any of you guys\nwant to help out with with advice or you\nknow hands-on feel free we're well you\nknow\num you know the bicycle rider youtube\nchannel is about about everybody you\nknow it's it's it's um you know it's not\nhighly polished and it's it's raw and\nit's real and i i welcome your input and\nand i welcome your help so uh let's see\nhow we can do this and make this a\nchannel for for everybody\nall right bicycle rider youtube bart\nluther over and out thank you"

      "transcript": "yo what is happening coach\nb here bpc um wanted to run through\nomg by the way good name oxford\nmississippi gravel\nuh not oh my gosh uh but anyway\ndiving into things so did this course\nlast year i did the hundred miler which\nis actually a little short\nyou can see 47.7 miles\nso a little short of the hundred um\nbut a challenging course nearly three\nthousand foot of\nelevation gain per lap for those that\nare doing the hundred and obviously\nuh three thousand ish feet for those uh\nonly doing the\nuh or that are doing the fifty there's\nno only about this\nas you can see very few flat portions of\nthis course\num this year uh so we're 2021 now\nit's gonna be cold so a cold start and a\ndownhill start\nbut then you get straight into two\npretty\nsolid hills so i'm kind of zooming in\nhere\nyou're gonna roll out uh this is paved\nand you have a hard right it narrows and\ngoes into gravel\nand you have two pretty substantial\nclimbs\nright away if you are not warmed up you\nare going to be in trouble\nso make sure you have a good warm up\nbefore this race starts\nor you may end up on your limit uh and\nplaying and playing chase\nuh so then we start or we continue sorry\num you get through that first part kind\nof a net uphill\ndives back downhill and again another\nclimb and that's kind of the theme for\nthis course a lot of\nundulation some faster downhills\nstraight back\ninto uphills so it's going to be a very\ntough course\ni think most notable um from what i can\nremember from last year\nyou know i have slept since then um\ni remember the hills on the initial\nsection\nbeing being tough um this\nclimb here we'll go and highlight it\nwas more of a challenging climb as well\nuh\nand never trust the elevation profiles\nthat you give you on this\num so that was a more challenging one\nand then\nlet me unzoom out here um\non the on the sort of back side of this\ncourse\nright after you take a right-hander\nuh where was it i think it's one of\nthese i think it's these two right here\num at mile roughly what are we at here\noh gosh the little screen share things\nin my way so i can't see\nuh probably roughly the 20-ish mile mark\nand again right after that um at the\nwhat was that going to tell us like the\n22 mile mark\nuh are some challenging climbs um again\nit's all going to depend on how\nhow the group races it how the people\nride it you do end up with a paved\nsection so\num there's the aid here\nright where it goes from from gravel to\npaved and then this is all road so kind\nof from\nthe 28 mile mark until you dump off of\nthis\nright here so until the 31 mile mark\nthere's three miles of paved road so you\nget a little bit of uh\nrelief uh word has it that the\ncourse is pretty dang fast this year um\ni will\nsay one spot that i found uh\nreally hard last year is this this final\nso um you get back onto paved road\nright about here i think so right about\nmile 42 ish\ni think it's kind of where you you dump\nand then we have a paved section um\nas you get onto whatever little highway\nthat is uh but this is going to be all\npaved\nuntil we dive back down this road so\nfor those that did it last year for\nthose that did it in 2020\nbefore this pandemic kit it was a little\nbit different so\nyou actually came down this really steep\nhill\nso this is a steep hill right here this\nis what we're going up now\nthe finish last year was a little\nfurther down it looks like finish\nthis year is going to be pretty much at\nthe top of that climb\nbut but last year in 2020 we came all\nthe way to the same entrance\nyou went down and then we did this\nlittle section here which is not visible\nso i'm not totally sure what it looks\nlike past this baptist church\non that base things baptist church and\nwhen maybe we can go to satellite and\nget a better feel for it\nwhere we switch to gravel i'm guessing\nall that's paved yeah it looks like it's\nall paved until you get right next to\nthat church\nand then you're going to dump into\ngravel this was pretty i'm guessing it's\ngravel\nthis was narrow uh it was muddy this is\nkind of low-lying\nflat area so this is some of the more\nmuddy part of the course\nlast year um this section right here\nyou can see if you're looking at the at\nthe elevation profile down here as well\nthis was a pretty steep there's a little\ntree right here this was a\nfairly steep rutted out section um\nso that was a pretty challenging section\ntraction can be an issue there\ni i don't know how it's going to be this\nyear this was all shut down for\nfor folks that were previewing it so not\ntotally sure um then we got this flat\nsuper flat section which takes you to\nwhere it goes paved again pavement hits\nagain i think right here and once we\nkick onto this pavement\nmaybe it's a little sooner than that um\nnow that's right so once it kicks onto\nthis oh wait no it's right here\nso the pavement starts and you're\nstraight up this steep hill\nand this thing's a doozy uh last year\ni believe i was on a 40 what am i on a\ni did not have my two easiest gears they\nweren't shifting into it\nuh 46 25 maybe\n23 and it was out of the saddle\nmaxed out i mean it says it's nine nine\nand a half percent\nthat's easy sixteen percent um so it's\ngoing to be a very challenging finish it\ndoes taper off\nnear the end um so it does ease off\nbut it's going to be a full gas who can\nget up that hill uh\nthe quickest there's gonna be no real\ntime to to recover\nso if you got the legs um\nyou're gonna do well you know if legs\nare still still feeling good by the end\nbut this this will be a make or breaker\nuh if you come together or come to the\nbottom of that hill together it's gonna\nbe a matter of who\nwho has the power to weight ratio to uh\nto smash that really steep climb at the\nend of a race\nall right before i get too long-winded\non this um\na couple keys i guess keys are always\ngood going into a race\nnumber one um for just to break this\ndown it would be\nyou need to make sure um you know with a\ncold race\nit's really easy to not eat nearly as\nmuch as you should\nuh so there's still going to be a lot of\ncalorie burn um\nit's going to be easy for you not to to\neat most people are going to have the\nthicker gloves on you know 30\n30 degrees or so at the start for the\n100 milers\nhopefully it'll be a couple degrees\nwarmer for the for the 50s\nbut it's only supposed to get to like 38\nish um on the day so it's going to be a\ncold colder day\nyou're still going to need fuel so make\nsure you\nare eating have your bars\nwhatever it is you consume make sure you\nhave those pre-opened\nbecause fumbling around big thick gloves\nwhile you're trying to ride on gravel is\nnot going to be an easy thing\nalso if you're going to be wearing\nmultiple layers i would put\nsome nutrition in each layer that way if\nyou're shedding\nshedding from one layer to the next you\ndon't go from having food to not having\nfood\nso i would have kind of plan out you\nknow based on\ntemps when you might be shedding gear\nassuming you are\nand making sure you've got you got fuel\nsources\nin multiple layers uh good chance that\nyou know i'm probably wearing my tights\nmy my bibs underneath\num jersey jacket\nuh wind jacket and i'll probably just\nkeep all my fuel\nin that wind jacket i don't think i'm\ngoing to be shedding shedding a jacket\nin those tents\ni'll have arm warmers underneath so\nnumber one\nmake sure you're you're focusing on\neating don't get sidetracked or thinking\nit's cold and not fuel or that's going\nto come back to haunt you\nnumber two really hard when it's cold\nbut ideally\nyou're going to want to warm up um this\nfirst\nthese first two hills are not going to\nbe fun so\nwe're going to want a warm up um if your\nif your plan is to see how well you can\ndo if it's to stay with the front group\nyou can't leave it to chance if you're\ngoing out there to have your best race\nand you're going to be able to pace\nyourself and you're not worried about a\ngroup\nthen obviously you can kind of warm up\nas this as this race starts\nbut if you're planning on racing it from\nthe front you need to make sure you're\nyou're revved up and ready to go and\nthen my third tip my third takeaway here\nis going to be um\ni'm losing my train of thought third tip\noh shift often\nso with rolling courses like this it's\nreally easy to get\nget lazy and get stuck in a big gear\nmake sure you are spinning as much as\nyou can on the front end of the race\nand you will be really happy that you\nhave your quads\nuh saved some that muscular\nuh fatigue we're trying to minimize\nbecause you're going to need it late in\nthe race late during this event\nespecially as you conquer that 16ish\npercent\nbeast near the end and\ni think that's all i got uh look forward\nto seeing folks out there i hope\neveryone has a great\ntime uh stay safe say rubber side down\nand remember\nshame time is hammer time please"
