      "transcript": "Hey guys, Saturday, April 12th. We are\nin Opelica, Alabama for the Okeyokei\nGravel Roll. We got here last night. Did\na little short 7 and a half mile ride.\nIt was cold. It rained. The wind was\nblowing. It's a neat little deal. But we\nate at the Red Clay Brewing Company. Um\nhad a beer. Some uh people from\nTallahassee are here. It was kind of\nneat. It's kind of different. It's a\ndifferent spot. Check this\nout. Oh, we camped last night over at\nChilaka or Chewy as we like to call\nit and\nuh pretty morning 40s and\nuh I'm going to try to record the ride\ntoday. So, we'll see how it goes.\nAnyway, catch up with you later.\nHave a great ride, Jen. Thanks for being\nhere.\nWell, that didn't work\nout. I couldn't get the GoPro mount with\nthe number plate to work on the front of\nthe bike, and I waited till the last\nminute to do it. I didn't feel like\ncutting more number plate off to try to\nget the GoPro to stick in there. It was\njust the number plate stretched from bar\ntape to bar tape on that one those bars\nand I couldn't get it to work. So, no\nfilm from the ride. It was a really nice\nride. It's been a beautiful day. I am\ntired. We're going to go back over to\nRed Clay Brewing where we ate pizza last\nnight and uh get my two complimentary\nbeers. It's been a beautiful day. It's\nbeen a great day. Um maybe I'll film\nsome of the festivities.\nwon't make up for no ride. But anyhow,\nsee you\nYeah, I thought that that video was so\nshort. Um, I did a little ride recap.\nIt's I think Monday after Easter now we\ndid the ride the mountain bike race\nSaturday went down and back by myself\nand the week before was the Okie dokie\ngravel roll on the Okeyokei. I'd do that\nagain. That was a neat ride. They did\nthese two time segments.\nSo they had a sign and a wire across the\nroad and they gave you an ankle bracelet\nand you when you cross that it clocked\nyou into the segment and then the first\none was 10 miles long and it clocked you\nout. And the second one was I think 23\nor 26 milesi long clocked you in and out\non that. It was good. It was fun. The uh\nroads were good. Alabama's a neat place.\nHardly any cars. I think when the whole\ntime thing was over with, I got fifth\nout of 13 in the 60 plus\nclass because you could just look at the\njust look at the results on your phone\nwhen you got back. That was that was\ncool way to do it. Food was good, beer\nwas good. Opilaka, Alabama was a neat\ntown. Guy was a little unorganized. It\nseemed like he's done a lot of rides,\nbut he seemed unorganized in this one.\nUm they had some trouble with people\ncutting the wires from one of the longer\nsegments. I did the 65 mile segment.\nThere was a 30 and a 100m option. Also,\nwe ended up after the race or ride,\nwhatever you want to call it, Irish pub\nin downtown Opalaka and had a good time.\nWent back and camped at Chewy. Got the\nnext morning, did a little recovery walk\nin Chewy. And then uh next weekend,\nwhich was last Saturday, we I drove down\nto Elatcha, which just north of\nGainesville, gone riding, did a three or\n30 or 60 mile mountain bike race. your\nchoice. They do it by miles or laps\ninstead of just time. Just kind of like\nit better because then you know where to\nwhere to stop. Was I don't know 60s at\nroll out. Got up into the upper 80s by\nthe end of the day. I had a really good\nride. I'm in a good spot right now with\nmy riding. My uh power numbers are are\ndoing well. Able to hold. All three laps\nwere within 20 seconds of each other.\nThere was only eight of us there. I got\nthird out of eight. But still was nice\nto get a ribbon. I was I didn't even\nknow they were going to call my name. I\nwas back at the truck, heard them\nholler, come to the podium. I was pretty\npumped about it. Pretty nice. And I'm 69\nand those both those guys beat me were\njust 60. So, it's an excuse. Pick your\nexcuses early and stick with them as we\nalways say. Anywh\nwho going to uh do the\nuh\nwinder, what's it called\nagain? 30 spokes. 30 spokes. It's also a\n36. It's timed. It's the last race of\nthe Chain Buster Series up in Winder,\nGeorgia. Going to go up there and camp\nand race. And um after that, I don't\nknow what's going to happen rest of the\nsummer. We'll see.\nAnyway, it's been fun. I enjoy these\nthings. And this is a waste of time.\nLater."

      "transcript": "Good day, transetters, and welcome to my\nreview of the Trek Checkout. A full\nsuspension drop bar gravel bike that is\na rather polarizing bike design to say\nthe least. In fact, I'm expecting the\ncomment section to feature diet tribes\nsuch as, \"Oi, that thing is just a drop\nbar mountain bike.\" But according to\nTre, nah. In fact, Tre designed this\nbike to be faster than a rigid gravel\nbike on single track type scenarios and\nfaster than a mountain bike if you were\nto ride pavement or gravel roads that we\nknow and love. In other words, this bike\nis an inbetweener machine if you will.\nIn fact, in the marketing material for\nthis bike, Tre mentions this would be\nthe perfect machine for the tour divide.\nInteresting stuff for certain. So, let's\ncrack on with the review of the Trek\nCheckout. This variant of the Checkout\nis the top tier offering, the SL7\nAccess, which features obviously ShraMM\naccess electronic shifting components.\nAt the heart of this bike, it would be\nthe 500 series OLV carbon frame. At the\nfront end, we have a specially made for\nthis bike by Rock Shocks. It's a Rudy XL\nsuspension fork with 60 mm of travel,\nwhich is more than the traditional\ngarden variety Rudy fork that was\nreleased a couple of years ago.\nObviously, they want to take the serious\nedge off the serious hits that you might\nencounter riding this bike. At the rear\nend, handling the suspension duties, we\nhave the Sid Lux shock, and that has 50\nmm of travel. Tre haven't exactly\nscrewed about with this frame. They have\ntested this to their exacting standards\nthat they submit all of their mountain\nbike carbon frames to. So, you should be\npretty confident along with the warranty\nof course that this bike is going to\ntreat you right. The cockpit parts,\nwell, it's quite interesting. You have a\nGR checkpoint handlebar, which well,\nit's flared, but according to Tre, it's\nnarrower at the tops and wider at the\ndrops. That's pretty obvious. Now, the\nhand position, it's going to tilt your\nhands like that. So, that's not going to\nbe for everybody, and we'll cover that\nin the review at the appropriate time.\nAdding to that, there's an ultra short\nstem. That's because the geometry of\nthis bike is geared towards mountain\nbike type fittings. So, a longer top\ntube, shorter stem, or longer reach,\nhigher stack, that sort of thing.\nDefinitely be certain to scope out the\ngeometry chart on this bike and pay\nclose attention to those numbers.\nKeeping with the mountain bike inspired\nversatility of the checkout, that is a\nwireless dropper seat post by Rock\nShocks. And when it's paired with the\nfantastic ShraMM electronic shifting,\nyou simply have to hold a couple of\nbuttons down depending on your\nconfiguration. And you can wirelessly\ndrop the seat post or raise the seat\npost. Really handy stuff. Cool\ntechnology for certain. Tire clearance\nis set at 700c by 56 mm or 2.2 in. In\nfact, there's some pretty serious rubber\non this bike, stock from the factory.\nThese are Bontrager Betasso RSL tires.\nThey measure 700C by 55 mm and they are\nfitted to Aolus Pro 3V tubeless carbon\nwheels. With me mentioning the tour\ndivide earlier, that implies there's a\nton of versatility with mounting points\nall over this bike. Then, of course, we\nhave a fully integrated rack. Now, I\ndon't have any bags that are available\ndirectly from Tre. Those bags are part\nof their topo line, but the rack plays\nseamlessly with the suspension and the\ndropper seat post. There's not going to\nbe any hassles. The drivetrain on this\nbike is a combination of Shramm Force\naccess with the shifters. And at the\nrear end, we have a mullet type\nconfiguration with Shramm Eagle XO one\nby. There is a 38 to chain ring on the\nforce crank set and the cassette is\npretty huge. It's a 10 to 52 12speed\nunit. Trick have definitely done a bit\nof homework with the thoughtful gearing\nfor this bike. Lower gears are better\nwhen you're creeping along, especially\nif you do have a load on board. And\nspeaking of loads, this bike is rated to\n275 lbs of carrying capacity including\nthe rider weight. So, that's about 125\nkg if metric nomenclature is your thing.\nThat wraps up the technical specs of the\nTrek Checkout. Now, it's time to find\nout how this bike, which is wild and\ncrazy, rides. Let's get cracking. Before\nI get into it, the Trek Checkout is not\na Niner MCR9 RDO. I have reviewed that\nbike. I liked it a lot. But just to\nmention the head tube angle of 71\ndegrees of the Niner versus 69 degrees\nof the Checkout I rode. I'm not turning\nthis into a comparison video between the\ntwo bikes. I have had this bike for a\ncouple of months, not a couple of rides\nas with some of the BS I've seen other\nreviewers post. First up, the Checkout\nis not light with XTR pedals, titanium\nbottle cages by King Cage, and Wolf\nTooth. Sorry, I did not enjoy the Trek\nside loading cages. You're looking at\nabout 25.3 lb or 11.5 kg without the\nrack for a size medium with everything\nyou see, including the wireless dropper\nseat posts.\nI'm not going to discuss deep technical\nspecifications of the checkout\nsuspension and how it works. Mostly\nbecause this technology is really above\nmy pay grade. For those inclined, have a\nGoogle. I'm going to impart how I felt\nthis suspension impacted the riding\nexperience. First thing, don't forget\nyou'll need to set up the suspension\nfront and rear to account for your body\nweight, sag, etc. The weight of the bike\nwasn't a bother cruising around on\nflatter or rolling terrain, but this\nisn't a bike I'd recommend for your\nspirited gravel group ride. It isn't\nthat type of bike, and Tre has other\nmachines for higher speed riding. The\nCheckout's heft was noticeable anytime\nthe road tilted upwards, and it's not a\nbike I would recommend for climbing out\nof the saddle, unless you lock out the\nfront fork at minimum. For seated\nclimbing, my pedaling effort wasn't\nrobbed by the rear suspension bobbing\nabout the place. Rather, a smooth\nsensation of traction and comfort.\nPretty efficient really. With all of\nthat said, the checkout certainly isn't\nslow. Rough and challenging terrain is\nwhere it shines. The suspension is\nmassively smoothing out the ride when\nyou're smashing potholes front or rear,\ndeliberate or otherwise, and the endless\nsmall bumps you'll feel riding most\nmixed surface roads. If you're thinking\nabout racking up bike packing miles or\nlonger exploratory miles that may\ninvolve bush bashing, rerouting, and so\non, you will feel fresher because of the\nwork the suspension and those 55 mm\nPasso tires have done for you. The\nsuspension absolutely instills\nconfidence and safety riding dodgy\nterrain, especially when descending. 60\nmm of travel for the fork is overkill\nfor most normalish gravel roads, but\nabsolutely spot on for this bike's\nintended use case. Crazy.\nDoes the checkout suspension mitigate\ncorrugations or washboard? No. These\nsuspension designs simply cannot rebound\nfast enough to deal with this annoyance\nin the road surface. And before anybody\nchimes in telling me how good the La\nfork is, aka the La Pogo stick fork as I\ncall it, it's absolutely worthless on\ncorrugations and is an eyesaw to boot.\nWhat works is big tires, something to\ncheck out does have 700c by 55 mm and\nthey were having the biggest effect on\nride comfort on low pressure in the\nsituation of washboards or corrugations.\nThe checkout is not a drop bar mountain\nbike. The crank set has a lower Q\nfactor. I like that. And you don't have\nboost spaced wheels. The bike accepts\nwheels with a 12x100 mm front through\naxle and a 12x 142 mm rear through axle.\nThe checkout has me sitting more upright\ndue to the taller front end and\ndimminitive 60 mm stem, but it didn't\nfeel horribly awkward, and I was really\nsurprised by how well the bike steered.\nThe stock Bontrager GR check out 44 cm\nhandlebar is designed to offer better\ncontrol with the flare drops and its\nconstruction touts some vibration\ndampening. I'll be honest here, I hated\nthese handlebars during many of my\nlengthy solo rides aboard the checkout.\nMy wrists were killing me from the angle\nmy hands were forced to sit riding the\nhoods. Sure, I understand the more\ncontrol of the drops, but if you're\nriding into a block headwind, these bars\njust open up your frontal profile and\nmake for a tougher effort. I broke the\nrules and I swapped to a 42 cm compact\ndrop handlebar. And for me, the bike\ninstantly became more comfortable, felt\nmore responsive, faster, and more fun to\nride. All of this was important as I\ntook the check out to a fun mountain\nbike event in North Florida, aka the\ntour to Felasco. 50-ish miles of flowy\nsingle track with lots of small\nelevation changes and a good amount of\nfire roads. I don't own a mountain bike.\nIt isn't my thing, but the Checkout was\na total blast to ride on these flowy\ntrails. And whilst I wasn't setting\nspeed records, I could ride a decently\ncomfortable pace through the woods. To\nbe expected on fire roads, the checkout\nabsolutely crushed. Cable routing is\nsemi- internal, meaning nothing is\nrouted through the handlebars. But that\nrear hydro housing runs inside the frame\nand through the headset bearing. Not for\neveryone. I am pleased to say the\nCheckout emanated no noises from its T47\nbottom bracket suspension or that brake\nhousing slapping about inside the frame.\nI cannot speak for the Checkout's bike\npacking abilities, but the included\nrack, which integrates nicely, works\nperfectly with the rear suspension, is\nvery thoughtful, as are the copious\nmounting points for other bags.\nDefinitely see the trebikes.com website\nfor more information about that aspect.\nIn the absence of a frame bag, I was\npleased I could fit two fulls size water\nbottles onto the frame since any\nfiddling about actually drinking from\nthem. Pricing. My example will cost you\nabout US $9,000. Certainly, it's not a\ncheap undertaking. I haven't researched\nthis, but I expect the comment section\nmay draw price comparisons between Will\nSpec full suspension mountain bikes and\nthe Checkout. But don't forget the\ncheckout really isn't a drop bar\nmountain bike, but it is a very niche\nbike. I'm a little perplexed by Trex's\ndecision to produce this bike because it\ndoesn't really align with anything\nthey've built to date. That's not a bad\nthing, but I don't see the Checkout as a\nbest seller. It's a ton of fun to ride\nin the right circumstances, but do pay\nattention to geometry as it isn't your\ntypical gravel bike. I would on the\nsmaller side if I was choosing a size as\nit's easier to make a smaller bike\nlarger with a longer stem and so on. The\ncheckout wins on the grounds of safety,\ncomfort, and confidence, but do your\nresearch about those handlebars and\ntires. This spec of the Potasso, I would\nsay, is geared more towards mountain\nbiking and dirt. A lighter and speedier\ngravel specific tire would be a good\noption for this bike. I just hope Tre\nfinds an audience for this rather\ninteresting and rather quirky bike, the\ncheckout. Learn more at trebikes.com.\nSo, there you have it, trendsitters, my\nreview of the rather polarizing trek\ncheckout. As always, thank you for\nwatching. If you haven't already, please\nconsider subscribing to the Gravel\nCycles YouTube channel for real world,\nno ultra crazy gravel bike\nreviews such as this one, other product\nreviews, ride experience videos, and of\ncourse, one of my favorite things in\nlife really, general madness.\nThat car is going nowhere.\nRear wheels just spinning pointlessly.\nThe dogs were here earlier, but it's\nalmost feeding time. So, they've\nabandoned my cause and headed inside.\nThat's how it goes. I'll see you in the\nnext video."
