      "transcript": "Let's get ready to\nfondo. I'm all confused. I'm all messed\nup. I'm\nlost. I'm out here in the woods by\nmyself riding my bike, talking to\nmyself.\nWow. Wow.\nOkay, this is the race.\nDon't know the course. So, good morning.\nWelcome to another Two Wheels\nWednesdays. Today we're up in Cottage\nGrove, Oregon for the Oregon Grand\nFondo. This is my third time doing this\nevent. Just like the other two, I'm\nrunning a little bit behind.\nSo, we'll talk about a little bit more\nafter the start, but we've got about 30\nseconds before There it is.\nBefore it's time to go. So, it's time to\ngo.\n[Music]\nOfficially, the Grand Fondo isn't a\nrace. The phrase Grand Fondo roughly\ntranslates to big ride. And the original\nGrand Fondos were mass participation,\nlong distance community cycling events\nfor all levels of riders, young and old,\nslow and fast.\nBut as the saying goes, any two bicycles\nis a race.\nAnd here we go. Here at the timing\nmat and we're off.\nTechnically, it's a timed event where\nyour final place is determined by how\nlong you rode the course, not whether\nyou finished before anybody else.\nSo, I started towards the back of the\npack and moved up once I was past the\ntiming mat.\nThere was a mile or so of neutral riding\nto the edge of town and the start of the\nday's first climb. The pack of 250 or so\nriders stretched out pretty quickly once\nwe were\nunderway. Okay, Garmin says\nthere's six climbs of the day and this\nis the first\none. I'm about halfway through, so I\nhave about\nanother 6/10 of a mile to\ngo. And\nuh people are passing me, but I'm\ndetermined not to burn all my matches at\nthe start like I normally do.\nSee\nyou in a few\nhours. That was the end of the first\nclimb. And uh that's where the\ntiming the official finish is going to\nbe.\nall the way back there. Now it's time\nfor one big long\nloop and a big\ndownhill. So the entire ride today is\ngoing to be around 66\nmiles, but the time section is somewhere\n59 or 60 miles. That's the real race.\nAnd uh we ran over the mats at the start\nand that's where we finished right back\nthere. Here's a map of the\nrace. We started at Cottage Grove High\nSchool and rolled through town before\nthe first of several climbs. The course\ncould be described as a lollipop route.\nWe rode from Cottage Grove to the tiny\ntown of Lraine, Oregon, and then did a\nlarge loop before returning back to\nLraine. From Lraine, it was back the way\nwe came with one last climb, the\nbackside of our first climb of the day\nto the end of the time section. After\nthe official finish, we had a long and\nvery welcome descent back to Cottage\nGrove. All in all, it was about 66 miles\nwith a little more than 3,700 feet of\nclimbing. Yeah. So, there's some hills,\nthere's some ups and\ndowns, and uh I hope to finish the time\nsection in 4 and 1/2\nhours and\nuh you know, finish the whole day in 5\nhours.\nAll right, I'm at mile\n24 or somewhere around there. And\nuh I figure I'm going to have to average\nabout 14.\ntwo or\n14.3 miles an hour including rest\nstops to\nuh finish in 4 and 1/2\nhours. Right now I'm averaging\n16.1\nso might be able to pull it off.\nGet\naway. It's a beautiful\nride so far.\nThank you.\nFriendly\ngals. Always nice to see a smile on the\nroad.\nAll\nright. Cheering\nsection. All right. Thank\nyou. And this is the start of climb\nnumber\ntwo, which will bring us up to I\nthink the next rest\narea.\nOkay, I'm going to stop talking and\nstart climbing. It's time to climb.\nSo, I did the math wrong. I think I've\ngot to be doing math all\nday. I don't think it's 14 and a4 miles\nper hour.\nI think it's like\n136. All right. Well, here's the start\nof the next\nclimb. This one looks pretty\nsubstantial. 700 ft, 2 and 1/4 miles.\nI think the aid station is coming up\nhere\nsomewhere. I don't\nknow. I'm\nall I'm all confused. I'm all messed up.\nI'm lost.\nI'm out here in the woods by\nmyself, riding my bike, talking to\nmyself. It's all\ngood. All\nright. So when I got here,\nthanks guys. Awesome stop. Yeah. Have a\ngood one.\nDanger ahead. Woohoo. I thought I left\nhim back\nthere.\nOkay, that was like 2 minutes.\nMaybe two and a\nhalf.\nHere we\ngo. That was good. Mission accomplished.\nYeah.\nCan't do that on gravel. At least I\ncan. All right.\nWe're a little bit more than halfway\nthrough miles wise, distance-wise, and\nwe're\nabout more than a half more than halfway\nthrough elevation gain\nwise. And this is the start of what GL\nGarmin is calling climb number\nfour. It's not that long, but it looks\nkind of\nsteep. See if I weighed myself down too\nmuch at that rest stop.\nOkay, here we\nOkay, that was the top of that climb.\nthat. So, there was a ripping descent\nafter the\nuh aid\nstation which brought us to the bottom\nof that climb.\nSo, with that\ndescent and that long\nclimb, I'm still at 14.1 miles per hour.\nI think I just might make my\ngoal. But my math has\nbeen my body has\ntaken all the energy from the math part\nof my brain and put it in my lungs and\nmy\nlegs, which is\nfine. I'll get there when I get there.\nWow.\nWow. Okay, this is a race.\nH. Okay.\nSo, in preparation for this\nrace, I set up a nutrition\nplan, and I've got it printed out and\nposted right here on my top\ntube. And it was in my plan all\nalong to skip that aid station. I've got\ntwo bottles.\nI got plenty of\nfood\nand there's only like 16\nmiles left to the\nfinish. So, I didn't need to stop.\nOkay, well we're into the last\nclimb. There's like two miles left.\nAnd I think the top of the\nclimb is the end of the\ntiming. And I'm averaging right around\n14.4 miles an hour. So I think I'm going\nto beat my\ngoal. But I'm not there yet.\nWell, Garvin says that was the end of\nthe\nclimb, but we're still going\nup. And as far as I can\ntell, we're still a mile or so away from\nthe finish.\nBy the time I was finishing the medial\nroute, the fastest riders doing the full\ngrand route, 100 miles and almost 6,000\nft of climbing were coming up to their\nfinish. Those guys and gals are fast,\nman.\nYeah, I think early I was probably\npulling at my threshold and then after\nlike the first hour and a half I was\nlike I should probably knock this back\nto Right. Yeah, exactly. A little less.\nThank you. There you go. You're welcome.\nWe do have water and your soda if you\nwant it. I'm thinking about that porta\npotty myself. I've been thinking about\nit for the last few miles. I\nthought you guys had on us\n10. That's what\nAll right.\nWell, made it made it back to the start\nfinish\narea. That was\nfun. That was that was a good\nworkout. Um, I think my official time\nwas\n4 hours and 10 minutes. So, I beat my\ngoal time by 20 minutes, which is good.\nwhich is really\ngood. Um, I think I ended up sixth than\nmy age group,\nwhich I was hoping for better, but it is\nwhat it is. Those guys are just\nfaster. And\nuh, yeah, I think that puts it puts me\nout of the running. I think I'm\nmathematically eliminated from a podium\nposition for the\nuh for the\nseries. Oh\nwell, but doesn't matter. Still one more\nrace and I'm going to go for\nit. Okay, well I guess that wraps it up\nfor this week's Two Wheel Wednesdays.\nThanks for joining me. I hope you\nenjoyed the ride. I sure did.\nAnd\nuh remember, life is twice as good on\ntwo wheels. We'll see you next\ntime. And finally, a big shout out to\nMike and Andy Ripley and their crew at\nMudslinger for staging another great\nevent. See you next year."
