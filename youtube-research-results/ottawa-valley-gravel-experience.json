two years has kind of been\non hold\nbut it's coming back\nthis year and i'm super excited to have\nbrandon here to talk all about it and\ngive us the details welcome brandon\nthank you for having me\nso i always love to get started with\nhow did you personally get into cycling\nand then how did it how did this idea of\na gravel series\ncome to be\nhe was uh\nwhen my grandpa was in the military and\nuh they were in late high school and he\nuh\nhe discovered cycling over there and uh\nbasically uh it stayed with him for the\nrest of his life uh and racing and he\ngot into racing when he got back to uh\ncanada and of course when he had\nchildren\nhe uh\nhe basically instilled the\npassion in my brother and i my younger\nbrother charlie\nso uh cycling has been with me\nuh since pretty much i was born since i\nwas since i was in the\nbaby seats of my parents bikes and uh\nstarted racing at a very\nbasically the youngest age that you\ncould possibly start\nso yeah it's my dad worked in in the\nbicycling industry managing and then\nowning his own shop and operating a shop\nout of his house that he he recently\nretired from the bicycle business after\n50 years\nbut\nyou know i got out of cycling\nat\nvarious uh\nintervals from my life and uh then i got\nback into it in uh 2017\nto do um\nyou know what my dad was very road race\ncentric\nand uh we weren't really\nyou know steered too many other\ndirections um\nhe never you know discouraged us from\ndoing other things but we just were very\nvery focused on the road\num although i did do triathlons for for\nthree years but that was uh that was\nwhen i was in like elementary school and\nmaybe\nlike grade nine i think was last year i\ndid it and then i got back into cycling\nbut yeah then i got back into cycling in\n2017 and i uh you know to do road racing\nbut i did the almond uh\nperry roubaix\nrace one april and um you know i had a\ncyclocross bike which is my gravel bite\nand um\ni don't know just like i was curious\nalways wanting to explore and there had\nbeen some roads some roads that uh\ni had you know been curious about for a\nwhile\nand uh i decided to check them out and\nuh you know the first one was kind of a\nreally wild surprise\ni just sort of went down it and i didn't\nhave any idea like what it was like you\nknow how long it would take me to get to\nthe other side i realized that i had\nforgotten a pump and a spare tube\nso you know i was like okay i better\nmake it through this or else i'm gonna\nbe sleeping in the bush all night um\nand uh and eventually i made it through\nto the other side and\ni think that was kind of like the first\nexplosion in my head where i got that at\nkind of a\nadrenaline in injection where like you\nknow you\nyou know when you when you when you\ndiscover something new\nuh it just it just became kind of like\nan addiction and i went down the rabbit\nhole and uh\ni've been you know\nuh a map lover i love maps for whatever\nreason and i uh google maps i wish if i\nhad google maps like when i was a kid i\nprobably wouldn't have had any friends\nbecause i just would have spent all day\nlike looking at google maps because it's\nit's amazing especially the satellite\nso uh you know over the last few years\ni've just made up my business to\nyou know expand my\nuh radius\nof of roads to\nyou know i want to know where what this\nroad's all about what that road's all\nabout and um and then you know you sort\nof\ncan put together a root\nvery\neasily and very quickly but also have it\nlike a very high quality root\nand uh i've been taking\nyou know it hasn't really been uh you\nknow calculated or super organized but\ni've been you know taking people on\nrides and showing the roads that i've\ndiscovered and\nand been getting a lot of uh of uh\nsatisfaction from that\nand uh you know in i think it was in\nuh because of where i live far west\nottawa all the uh local\nthe weekly training races there was the\ntime trial\nuh on the rock cliff parkway or you know\nwhat's called something else it's called\netienne karcher now\nand uh then there was the um\nthe tuesday night\nwe just weren't near my house\nactually the year i got back into\ncycling they were all the way at the\ngatineau air close to my house and i\nthought oh you know like\nuh gravel i like gravel why don't i have\na\nlike a gravel training race and i\nthought i was pretty smart\nand pretty cunning and i thought it\nwould be a big success it turned out\nthat it was not a big success it uh but\nit was in a way it was a success because\ni learned that uh\nyou know people weren't gonna\ncome all the way out here to on a\nweekday to you know to do a a weekday\ngravel event\nand that same year i\nyou know i i did three smaller cyclo\nsportifs\num you know so like one 80 kilometer\nroute from the kenburn community center\nand those events were organized late in\nthe year but i got\nyou know 30 or 40 people and the events\nwent really well so i got again another\na general adrenaline injection\nfrom that and uh\nand then in 2019 i put all the uh the\norganizational skills that uh that my\nmom gave me growing up uh thanks mom\ni put those into action\nand uh\nyou know for me i'm i was i'm a\nstay-at-home dad so i don't have a\nregular\njob i've been a stay-at-home dad\ni think ever since you know kyle turned\none so it probably would have been some\nback somewhere back in 2016.\nyou know so i had a decent amount of\ntime to dedicate to the series and um\nyou know i got felt as a sponsor they\nwere going to sponsor the series\num i got shimano was going to be at my\nmar was going to be at my marquee event\nthey were going to have a sprinter van\nand\nand i was having numerous like other\nsmaller sponsors eurosports was going to\nbe uh the presenting bike shop\nand i got uh max lee rochette was gonna\nbe there\nyou know the cross champion and she got\na second there the other\nuh recently so that was pretty cool\nand i was gonna get ted king\nuh he is uh somebody that that that\ndraws a lot of people he's got you know\nand after getting to know him a little\nbit i can see why he's\nuh you know he's normally sometimes\ngetting paying as i was saying paying\nriders to come to events\nsometimes\nyou know it's it's it's tricky but you\nknow if you find\nthe right you have to you have to like\nsay yes this is this is generally a rule\nit's a bad idea but you have to\nrecognize the exceptions\nwhere you know\nyou get\nproper bang for your buck and uh and i\nnoticed that you know when i was\nadvertising my marquee event the r3\ng3 uh you know people were signing up\nlike crazy it was it was\nthe registrations were rolling in and it\nwas\nyou know it was it was it was bonkers\nbut then of course i was down\nin south carolina my family and i\nnormally go down to south carolina in\nmarch and that was just when all the\ncoveted stuff\nwas uh\nwas hitting the fan\nand uh oh my god i went through such a\nprocess of\nall the stages of grief\ni went through it\nit was awful like i was like i i just\ncouldn't believe\nyou know i had basically teed up\nyeah we were even gonna go\nlike you had reached out to you and you\ngave us a discount code and i'm like\nyeah yeah we'll get some girls out there\nand then yeah everything like yeah my\nheart and soul is work so i've never\nthere has there hasn't hardly been\nanything that\ni worked so hard on\nand then just had it\nyou know go\npoof\n2019 was a giant year you know i was\ngetting\nyou know anywhere from 195 drags on\npeople people are really excited in the\nspring but uh you know i was getting 150\npeople later on in the season which was\nstill a lot\nfor me because really it was\nlike 2019 i sort of considered that like\na redo of my\nof my year one i sort of consider that\nmy\nyou know my really my first year because\nin 2018 i didn't even start to\nto organize these the the the cycle\nsportif gravel races until much later in\nthe year\nbut you know\ndidn't really have much of a choice in\nthe matter so i had to roll with it and\nand i think i got a lot of goodwill from\n2019 i did a good enough job so that\npeople will be\nwill be coming back and uh i'm excited\nabout next year i've sort of got a rough\noutline of\nyou know the events that i want to do um\ni think i got a couple from two are\ngonna be\ni know i i mean i\nit's things could one thing i know about\nevents is organizing is very hard and\nthings can change so don't nothing is\nwritten in stone but so far the basic\noutline is two events from calibogi\nand uh two events from\neither uh one might be from ken\nvineyards another one might be from the\nkenburn community center so like two\nevents in my area of west carleton\nand two events from calibogi so what i\nlike about\nwhat i like about my area of west\ncarleton is that um\nthe elevation is\nthere's there's it's rolling like it's\nnot it's not pancake flat but you know\nwhenever i have events out in lanark or\nrenfrew there's\nyou know you do 80 to 100 kilometers and\nyou're looking at you know a thousand\nmeters of elevation\nwhereas around my area you know if\nyou're doing 80 to 120 kilometers you're\nlooking at maybe five or\n600 meters of elevation\nand you know i i've kind of had a lot\nmore time to think about things and i\nused to think that like\nyou know the roads around my\nneighborhood weren't as exciting you\nknow the\nwhere i should go is that the highlands\nbecause you know the roads are more\ntwisty and they're in the in and narrow\nbut you know every time i go riding with\nmy gravel cup gang and you know jen is\none of them yeah i look at the roads\naround west carlton and i'm just like\nthese are really awesome roads you know\nthese are really really awesome roads\nyou got and you got views of\nof uh of of the ottawa river and the\ngatineau hills\nand yeah\nand they're just you know they're really\nreally nice roads and um\nand you have to think like if there's\nsomebody like me who's first timer\nyeah i would probably most likely likely\nlove them right because\nyou know it's it's when you've been on\nthem for a long time like oh my god they\nget kind of boring but you know it's\nexciting for someone who's coming in so\nyou've got four events in total over the\nsummer is that what i'm hearing\nyeah i'm kind of hesitant to uh expand\njust just because i\ni uh\nyou know i i got i don't want to say\nburned is the right word but i i\nlearned my lesson uh you know from covid\nand you know i don't want to organize\nyou know a ton of events and then you\nknow i i\nsee i see what's you know what's going\non with with you know variance here\nvariance there and everything is just so\nunpredictable and you know i would love\nto do\nmore but you know it's it's you know\ni've got two young kids kyle and quinn\nsix is well kyle's gonna be seven soon\nand quinn's four and they are\nthey you know they deserve my attention\nthey're only gonna be this age you know\nthe ages that they are they're only\ngonna be there once and then\nuh you know so\ni've gotta you know think about them as\nwell how much time do i want to put into\nsomething\nyou know because every more time i put\ninto something else the less time i can\nput into them so i've really that's\nanother thing that's kind of\ngiven me another uh jolt with the whole\ncovet thing is is uh is is the prop a\nbalance better balance between family\nbecause my son kyle\nuh really took to cycling like last year\nhe did uh as a as a five-year-old he\nrode like 1200 kilometers\nwhoa\nand then last winter\nuh he came to us and he said like we\ndidn't\nhe out of the blue like we had nothing\nto do with it he just came and said i\nwant to ride 4 000 kilometers in 2021\nand we're like\nokay we don't really have any idea where\nhe got who's gonna ride with him\nhe just yeah he he had just finished\nsenior kindergarten and you know this\nnow he's in grade one and so i said okay\nuh you know because funny he picked that\nnumber because\nit was just right on\ni mean maybe to other parents it\nwouldn't sound like this but to me as a\ncyclist and knowing what my dad was able\nmy dad would take us to some things and\nthe people who were organizing it were\nlike are you sure your kids can do this\nand my dad was like yeah you know they\nlike they took us to a\nlet's say example they took us to a bike\ntour when i was in grade six and my\nbrother was in grade four and it was 130\nkilometers\nand the tour leader said you know what\nare you guys doing like i'm gonna call\nchildren's eight or something you know\nlike what's i mean i'm just exaggerating\nbut like\nyou know but we finished by the time the\ntour the tour organizer finished we had\nalready packed up everything and got our\nice cream cones and we were leaving the\nparking lot so\nyou know i know that uh as long as you\ngive your kids food they can they can\njust keep going they've got a tremendous\nwell bounces off the walls\nso he had so much energy he was just\nlike waiting for an outlet\nand so yeah we started early on in the\nseason\ni was actually like he was the only kid\nin his entire school that was like we\nwere riding to school which was 16\nkilometers and then riding home\nand uh i had you know in the spring i\nhad never been so frozen in my life\nbecause i wasn't generating any heat i\nwas riding with him and even though i\nwas dressed super warm\nuh you know we're going like 15k an hour\nand i was just like oh my god like just\nso cold so freaking cold\nthankfully i was able to get him on his\nuh he's got a road bike a felt road bike\nand a phelps\ngravel bike\ncycle cross bike and i didn't think he\nwould be able to fit those this year and\nthankfully he did\nand i mean long story short he rode four\nthousand kilometers he did multiple\nrides like over 100 kilometers\nhe wow\nyeah one day we like we started from my\nbrother's into peeing and we rode all\nthe way we did a loop of gatineau park\nand then we did a loop of the elmer bike\npath\nand then we rode back to my brother's\nand it was like you know it was 105k\nwith\nlike a that he wanted to ride a hundred\nkilometers and he wanted to have over a\nhundred a thousand meters of elevation\nso we did that\nuh so you know\ni'll get back to my events but it was\nquite a year with my son riding 4 000\nkilometers uh and he's like i said he's\nsix years old\nyou know we did he did the ottawa\nbicycle club youth program he did odds\nmountain bike camp\nhe did uh nepean bmx racing the bmx\nracing was actually really cool i was i\nwas pleasantly surprised by\nthey have a good track out near\nout in the west end\nyeah i got a bmx bike too and i like\ndoing it i get on there and\nyou know i try not to go too crazy\nbecause i hold heard too many stories of\nadults uh\nyou know putting themselves\nit's those\ni've been on them with my mountain bike\nand it's the it's those bumps that will\nget you you're pretty sure it's like\nthis and then you end like you know his\nplant and then yeah next one if you\ndon't have your halobars up\nand then he did the cycle cross which\ni'm not\ni'm not huge and i'm kind of cyclocross\nis kind of growing on me but it's it's\nnot you know something\nyou know\nfrom it's not\nit'll have to grow on me a little more\nno doubt it will\nuh yeah and he's even got like his mic\nset up on the trainer he's got he he's\ngot a garmin watch\nso he's you know it anyway so that's\nthat's kind of a side story to the\ngravel cup because i've got i want to\norganize these events but i've also got\nthis kid who's whose enthusiasm for\ncycling is beyond anything that i could\nimagine\nyou know so uh\nit kind of threw me a curveball so\ni don't want to do like you know 10\nevents because i've got this guy who his\ngoal next year is is 6 000 kilometers\nbut um\nyou know what you need to do\nevents in west carl\nyou know what you need to do brandon is\nget get them out there\ntesting your roots you're like okay okay\nget him get him a map and like okay you\ngo i don't know if you're gonna let him\nride by himself just yet but you know\nlike but go testing like you're like\nokay let's go test a couple routes\nwhat do you think\nyou know i don't know put it put it to\nsome you'd you\ncould use while you have to get i mean\nhe already has he already has to some\nextent i mean like we got a cottage out\nin\nthe matawaska highlands which are\nyou know basically these are giant\neither either like i mean it's all like\nin many mountains you know that and he\nwas on for for the forest access roads\nwhich are like the logging truck roads\nhe was going down\nhills with like out touching the brakes\nand he was he was cornering like he was\ngoing around the corner so fast there\nwas one time where you know there was a\na creek and a culvert and there was a\ntight turn just before it and he was\ngoing so fast and i'm just i'm watching\nthis like happen and it was almost like\ntime slowed down and i was like either\nhe's gonna kill it or he's gonna go\nright into the water and somehow he made\nthe turn and i don't know how he's able\nto\nhe goes down\ni mean pavement gravel he goes downhill\nlike he's a bomb\nand like you know his top speed in\ngatineau park one day was like 55k an\nhour\nand he's six years old\nso oh my gosh six years old oh gosh you\nhave to think about his future right\nlike yeah is it into mountain biking is\nhe gonna hit the track like what yeah\nlike next year you know one of the\nthings is because i got my wife a gravel\nbike too from from eurosports from my\nbank and\n[Music]\nshe's been able\nto know ride with because she likes to\ngravel roads but she had a road bike\nwith the skinnier tires so she was with\nkyle as much uh just because like she\nhad a bad crash on gravel with the\nskinnier tires but um you know she for\nexample or i might for example ride\nalmont roubaix like the 40 kilometer\nroute with kyle next year\nbut uh but yeah getting back to the\nevents there like the two other events\nare at calibogi and uh\ni mean uh most people in the area are\nfamiliar with calabogie it's got a lake\nit's got a beautiful lake it's got a\nbeautiful\nhill a mountain\nuh that you can see and um you know\nthere's lots of amenities\nit's got a very good community center um\nit's it's a and it's it's got a lot of\nthings going for it so\ntwo events\nfrom there uh one of them\ni'm hoping uh\nis gonna be um\nlike a rail trail event the county of\nrenfrew\nwell in lanark too\nthey've invested a lot of money into uh\nrail trails and normally you know like\nsome rail trails depending on where they\nare can be\na little boring\nuh but these ones are you know they're\nthey're\nthey're up to snuff and um\ni would like to promote them and i think\nyou know for people who are you know may\nhave never considered going to an event\nbefore uh covet happened now you you\nknow you can't buy bikes\napparently there's you know there's more\npeople out there riding bikes now than\nthan before covid i i just had the idea\nthat you know if i have\nuh an event that uses the um you know\nbecause you can go up from\nyou can ride actually rail trail all the\nway from renfrew down to kingston uh\nlast year we actually did that we rode\nall the way down to kingston and then we\nrode back over the course of two days\nand um now you can actually ride all the\nway from smith falls to um petawawa\noh wow uh ottawa valley rail trail\nuh has been extended this year it was\nextended beyond ren through to cobden\nand then cobb to pembroke and um it was\nalready finished mostly between petawawa\nand pembroke\nyou know now it's\nyou know but there's you can also once\nyou take the kmp trail north from\ncalibogi\nyou go towards renfrew and you can take\nthe ottawa valley rail trail it's really\nnice it goes like right along the ottawa\nriver\ntowards arnprior and then there's\nanother\nrail\ntrail called the mcnabb brayside\nrecreation trail\nand it turns into the cn trail closer to\nrenfrew and you can do kind of a nice\nloop and it's got like um\nyou know enough variety in the in the\nrail trails like the mcnabb ray side is\nnot stone dusted but it's not like\nrail rock so it's a little gnarlier but\nnot too gnarly but you know rail trails\npeople like them because there's no cars\nand you know you you know i like riding\nthese trails as well um you know they're\nand i can throw in\nyou know some variety on on some of my\nfavorite gravel roads on this same\nroute because i\ni don't really want to send people\ndirectly through renfrew you know if i\nget 200 people i don't want to send them\nright through renfrew so you kind of\nhave to like\nfigure out a way around it that you know\nand you don't want to also do a direct\ncrossing of highway 17 because that's\nbasically like\na two-lane freeway\nbut this is the good thing about having\nwritten\nall the roads around here and know them\nso well is that\num you know coming up with roots is the\nleast of my problems figuring out ways\nto solve logistical problems by not\ncrossing this road or not crossing that\nroad or not going through this town i\ncan easily find ways around and um and\nnot only that it kind of adds to the\nvariety\nof the route like actually on this rail\ntrail route\nthere's uh\nthere's\nthere's a couple roads that are actually\nlike pretty much near\nmy the very very top of my favorite\ngravel roads to ride\nso it's it's a really good uh mixture\nand and and then the other\nthe marquee event this year is going to\nbe from calibogi\nand it uses um\nit uses a lot of uh\nare you going to use the um\nare you going to use the ski hill like\nas a\na starting location\nno no\nno it's too okay too difficult from\nthere because uh\nand you'd have to have all these\ncyclists ride calibogi road to get to oh\nso where would you start in california\nthen\nwell there's\nright when you get to\num you know you go you go past burnstown\nand then right you know almost as soon\nas you get to calabogie there's uh you\nsort of make a left and then you make a\nright and you're at this the lions the\nlions club it's on mill street in\ncalifornia okay and they're it's it's\nthe lions club but they've also got this\nlike nhl size outdoor covered arena\nso it's\nlike it's you know they've they've got a\nscoreboard i mean we're not going to\nobviously be playing hockey but it's\nit's quite extravagant it's uh it's got\na scoreboard it's got its own zamboni\nbut the main thing is that this for in\nthe summer can protect you from the\nelements so\nyou know if you're out riding there's\nnot really much you can do i can't have\na roof over you when you're riding but\nyou know when you're not riding you know\nor for spectators or for whatever\nyou know the um\nyou know other than being in the\ncommunity center you can be\nif it's\nif it's hot\nout and you can get out of the sun or if\nit's raining\nyou can get out of the rain\nbut it's just this massive\noutdoor covered arena and uh\nit was actually funny because i went\nwith i went to a meeting with some\nofficials from the county of renfrew and\nnot knowing one of the people who\nspearheaded this these out because\nthere's a couple of them\ni basically said these things are these\nthings are pure genius and the guy who\nwho was one of the guys who was like the\nmain guy who's got these in was there\nand he's like yeah it was my idea and i\nwas like oh yeah cool\nwow\nyeah so can i ask you about um your\ncategories how are you going to run the\ncategories for the event\ngoodness i haven't uh i haven't\nyou know i haven't really\nhave you done it in the past\nwhat did you do before\njust a second did this did this run\nbefore\ndid you have the well the series ran\nright\nin 2019 yeah in 2019 i just had uh\n2019 i just had open men\nopen women\nokay just two categories yeah because uh\none of the things about gravel that\ni'm attracted to um\nand i think\nmost people are and that's why it's sort\nof taken off is that\nmost people\nshow up to um to for a social fun event\nthey they might not they might not be\nracing or they might not be racing in\nthe traditional sense they might be\nracing themselves\nyou know what i mean like\neverybody everybody will see their name\non a results sheet and there will be a\ntime beside it\nand if the race happens over\nmultiple years you know you can compare\nyour time to your friends you can\ncompare your time to your own time and\ntry to beat it but you know really\nyou know there's the derrick st john's\nof the area are you know far and few\nbetween\nand um you know sometimes i think it's a\nshame that people\nyou know go out and blow their brains\nout over on these courses because they\ndon't really\nyou're not able to take the time to\nenjoy them\num and that was one of the things my\nbrother my brother\nsorry\nsorry i was just gonna say i like that\nmindset and i like that option because\ni know as a woman and uh and the more i\nhear more women getting into it\nyou would probably attract a lot of\nwomen it was just an open category right\nbecause\nyou know a lot of us just i mean there\nare one there are some of us who are\ncompetitive and we'll just go out for\ntime but there are a lot who will\nprobably come with groups of friends and\njust want to do\nthe route\nyeah\nyeah i mean one of the big pushes that\nall\nlike like gravel organizers um and i\ndon't think anybody has found like the\nmagic solution is to get more women\ninto\nit but\nyou know if if you look at what any any\nmaybe mountain biking would be an\nexception and poss i don't know about\nenough about bmx but there's\nthere's very few instances of\nwell not not even if you talk about\nparody but there's there's usually like\nmassive gaps like especially with\nroad\nthe difference between\nhow the women are treated in you know by\nthe uci for the road versus the men it's\ni i personally find it like embarrassing\nyou know like there should have been a\nwoman's tour de france\nyears ago uh um there should be\nthere should have been almost like\nyou know and it doesn't even have to be\nyou know it doesn't have to be although\ncycling is very traditional probably be\neasier to base it on\nyou know like the tour of italy well\nthere is a tour of italy for women but\ni mean it's just uh\nall i i can do is is try got a mosquito\nin the house here oh here we go i can't\nbelieve you have mosquitoes right now\nthat's unbelievable i don't know where\nthey some one they find their ways no\nthey find their way in\ni and i don't but they should be dead by\nnow history it's freezing\ni don't know but i like i heard there\nwas a it must have heard of wanted to\nsee some of the podcast yeah that's\nright he's coming to be a guest\nyeah but like um\ni know what you mean and\nlike even when i got into racing in 2005\nit was very like you know where all the\nwomen and and it was always just like\nthe same group of women and\ni found even now that it's uh with\nquebec i mean ontario has kind of kind\nof shifted more but\nthe the whole category thing like\nthere's no way to um\nbring women in so they can develop and\nthat's kind of something that i want to\nchange next year\nin my event is um\nhaving more categories for women\nyou know like uci like you know the\nthe a the d c b a you know like d being\nthe first timer the newbie the\nfirst year kind of and then moving up\ncategories as they get fitter\num just makes more sense um but\ni\nlike there's many things that i probably\nwill do like but you know every year\nyeah again i was put on pause for two\nyears but every year the series grows\nand i think you know even if it's not\nlike conscious in the front of my head i\nthink you know somewhere back there\nthere's you know an even more in-depth\nplan\nand a lot of stuff just flows naturally\ni find like i don't have to overthink it\nit just comes\nand i think a lot of stuff will um will\nnaturally develop because a lot of\npeople say well why don't you do this or\nwhy don't you do that\ni thought like\nthat's something i have thought of but\nit's like a step-by-step process so the\nseries every year will be different\ni mean it's like you're starting over\nyeah yeah yeah but you know for\none of the things that i did do in 2019\njust for\nyou know uh just for kicks i i decided\nto hold\num unofficial gravel nationals\nand so i did that and i i had one i had\nopen men and i had nobody said anything\nlike the cca or the oca didn't call me\nup and say oh you're not allowed to do\nthis because really there's not much you\ncan do i said it was unofficial gravel\nnationals and uh and so i did that and\nactually had bruno language win it who\nhe's won he won uh road nationals in\n2016 and he was\nin derrick st john actually two guys\nfrom a pro team um god what the heck was\nthat team\noh\nit was kind of crazy these two guys\nshowed up from this pro team i can't\nremember the name of it there\nno it was kind of a joint thing within\nus australia\nand it'll come to me at some point but\nanyway it was\nit was\nit was uh it brought some people out of\nthe and so when i was in 2020 i was\ngoing to have gravel nationals again and\nfor that event\nit was going to be multiple categories\nit was even going to go down to\num like cadet age you know it was\nbecause normally there isn't a cadet\nnationals but with gravel you can\nbasically do whatever you want\nso it was going to be you know there was\ngoing to be masters categories so you\nknow generally speaking i like my events\nto not\nbe totally focused on racing however i'm\nvery feel very strongly that there\nshould be something for the racers even\nif there's\nif even if they're less than 25\nand and you know if i'm\ngonna have timing anyway because there\nwas lots of people\nuh at first i wasn't timing the short\ncourse but people were\nyou know expressed their opinion that\nthey wanted to see their name because\neverybody wants a time everybody wants a\ntime so um you know if i'm doing that\nanyway\ni'm going to have something for the\nracers uh and and and it turns out\neverybody wants a time\nso but for you know for gravel nationals\nit was sort of going to be the one event\nwhere\ni was going to you know that one was\ngoing to be\nmore about the racing and it was\nactually going to be really cool because\nit was going to be on a 34 kilometer\nloop\nthat\nyeah and it was gonna have it was gonna\nhave like stone dust rail trail it was\ngonna have slightly gnarly rail trail it\nwas gonna have a short unmaintained road\nsection it was gonna have a summer\nmaintained road section it was gonna\nhave\nit was gonna have regular gravel roads\nit was gonna have like a tree wider\ngrout like it had everything and it was\ngonna be at this um\nuh apple orchard\na really picturesque apple orchard so if\ni do if if i do a fifth event it might\nbe that one but again i'm just a little\nhesitant\num getting back to the event\ni was just gonna say like if you if you\nhave your four events\nand you just have those two categories\nyou know by the end of the season\nyou will have enough people\ninterested in doing something more\ncompetitive\nyeah probably i think\nlike\ni had a crazy idea about because the the\nspot where i was gonna do gravel\nnationals had enough\nlike you know cell phone coverage or it\nhad enough\ntechnology coverage where i almost could\nhave like you know taken my gopro i\nthink if you get a good enough gopro you\ncan like almost live stream it\nso i had i never you know got far enough\ndown the road to you know research it\nbut you know the atv clubs were going to\ncome out and help and you know other\num you know hopefully would have like\nsome other vehicles i have a van my uh\nmy sister-in-law has a jeep\nand so i was gonna see if there was any\nway that you know even if we didn't live\nstream it at least record it and then\nput it on\nthe internet and and because it was a\nyou know you and it was an interesting\nenough loop that you know people\nwouldn't\nhave really minded to do it again\nor even three times it was really cool i\ntook my brother and jen\nout there to do the loop and they were\nskeptical you might be onto something\nhere brenden\nbut getting\ni was gonna getting back to the calibogi\nthe the marquee event in 2020 was\nsupposed to be the r3g3\num but that\ncourse was\nit's something i might get back to in\nthe future but you know after i did the\ncourse a couple times\nwith mike my mike nash and jen\nand the remoteness of it um you know\nplus with all the uncertainty\num i just decided that i'm gonna put\nthat one on the back burner for the\nmoment like it may come back not next\nyear but the year after but so the the\nthe marquee event that i'm planning on\nfor next year from calibogi\nis um\nis uh what i like about it is that it\nuses\nnot like unmaintained roads but what i\nactually find is the roads i enjoy\nthe most are\nwhat they call like um\ni mean they're not actually i don't know\nwhat they're they're just not maintained\nin the winter\nyeah i call them summer maintained roads\nbut they're they're roads that get\nmaintained but they just don't get\nplowed\nin the winter oh okay so you know they\nthey they don't get uh you know they\ndon't get giant rots in them because you\nknow if whatever damage happens to them\nit gets fixed whereas with unmaintained\nroads\nyou know the damage just gets you know\nworse and worse over time or it's rare\nthat you know an unmaintained road\ndoesn't get you know really beat it up\nand uh and getting back to um\nyou know for\nwhat i\ni there's a lot of people who like\ngravel events\nfor like the majority of gravel events\nin my opinion have a lot of\nfor lack of better ways\nthey have a lot of\ngnarly sections like that are you know\nborder\nreally straddle the line between\nmountain biking and gravel cycling or\neven like you know cycle cross\nthere's no shortage of events\nout there that\nyou know advertised massive amounts of\nelevation massive amounts of gnarliness\nyou know the the almond rube\nwas always if you go i think it's still\nthere it says\nthe alamo bay on the website says like\nthis\nroute has roads on it that should not be\nridden on a bicycle\nor something like that and you know\nwhether you're\nit doesn't even matter like i mean i\nguess i'm thinking\ni don't know\nas something as a way because there's no\nshortage of men that show up to gravel\nevents and\nand there's some men well don't worry\nabout the the women will come because\nwe're all there's enough\nwomen gravitating to gravel you all have\nto worry about you just have to get the\nword out so yeah\nwhere can we find you and when\non your website\nwill all the information be ready\nthat's the question because this is\nwhat's about um\ngetting this these events on your\ncalendar now\nthat it's january\nworking towards them because it's also a\nmonth where people really start amping\nup\ntheir training\nreally focusing and dialing in so yeah\nare these races going to be part of your\ncalendar\nwhere can we find you and when will your\nthe website be ready for registration\nyeah well that's\nthe thing is that i'm kind of um\nbecause i go with the ontario cycling\nassociation i am sort of subject to\ntheir protocols and\nnovember 15th was the first\ndeadline to\nsubmit to be\nconsidered for the preliminary\ncalendar so uh\nyou know they've they're going through\nall the submissions now\nand uh you know at some point they'll\nthey'll reach out\nand it you know it eventually gets\nworked out\ni sort of have a running you know\nspreadsheet of events that i don't want\nto conflict with\nright events i want to do myself plus\nlike you know family\nplus your son 6 000. yeah yeah yeah so\nso yeah i mean\nreally the only answer i can give is i i\nget everything done as soon as\nhumanly possible i don't really once i\ni have where's your website brandon\noh it's just\ngravelcop.com it's very easy hey that's\npretty easy\nyeah it's very easy\nso but yeah i'm i'm really excited about\nnext year i'm hoping that um\nthat uh i'm gonna try to make my uh i\ncould the thing is and what i was\ntalking about before i really like to\nget out there as as one of the main\nmessages\nis that i can do\ntons of exciting\nchallenging courses\nthey'll still be hard it'll still be\nchallenging it'll still be scenic but\nyou know i'm going to\ntry to minimize the uh\nyou know the mountain biking or the\ncycle cross or the super gnarly aspects\nof my series because in this area i'm so\nlucky to have such a variety of roads to\nchoose from that i don't need to\nintroduce\nsome type of insane section\nyou know to make the event uh um\nyou know stand out so i'm really lucky\nto live in this area i'm really lucky to\nthe the the the base of riders in ottawa\nlike i want to take attract people from\nall over but there's a sizable base of\ncyclists that are right in ottawa that i\ncan rely on to come and it's pretty cool\nso\nwith that we're going to so it's gravel\ncup dot ca and i imagine by march i'm\nsure everything will be updated as\ni think calendars are usually ready by\nend of february march for sure\num because i know everything starts in\napril\ni would really hope\ni would really hope to have like\nregistration open\nyou know as as early like as close to\njanuary 1st as possible uh oh wow\nyeah i would really like that to to\nhappen the oca has a new uh president\nthey just got a new president so they're\nprobably going through some\nnew challenges i think the new president\ncame from ring at\nso she might have you know a lot to\nlearn about cycling oh my gosh\nand yeah and you know it's\nyou know dealing with the governing\nbodies is a whole thing in itself\nthere's uh you know yeah well let's not\nget it they have their challenges we can\ntalk about that all day between ontario\ni have a whole podcast about that yeah\nguys make sure that you\ntake a serious look just look on the\nwebsite they have quite a bit up there\nalready from their past um\nbrendan's past event\nand um add it to your calendar like just\nkeep space for that four events\nget two out of four in there um i know\ni'm already looking at uh events to put\non my calendar\num but i know for certain that in our\nclub\nthere's a lot of girls who\num are gravel riding and can be\nconvinced to to attend at least one of\nthem um which i'm super excited about\nwould you believe that i'm actually a\nquiet introvert\nuntil i start talking about gravel cap i\ngotta shut you down\nbut you know because i don't actually\nlike to

      "transcript": "[Music]\nWe've spent the last couple days riding\nthrough the Highlands region and the\nroads are absolutely incredible. There's\nobviously a rich history and there's a\nlot to see here. Why would you uh\nrecommend that people come here and\nvisit this area?\nThere's probably three reasons. There is\nthe actual natural scenery we have here.\nIt's the roads that match a motorcycle's\ndesire for twisties and turnies.\nI think if you follow this, you'd just\nbe perfect. You'll see everything you\nhave to see.\nAnd it's the history of the area that we\nare still living. This is not a fake\nhistory that we've assembled for show.\nPeople are living history here. And as\nyou'll notice as you drive through the\nvarious settlements in this particular\narea, people are actually living the way\nthey did back in the settlement days\nwith modern amenities.\n[Applause]\nI'm saying to my wife today, you realize\nthat we are still living the way they\ndid back in this except we have propane\nnow.\nYeah, for sure. Well, and instead of\nriding a horse, you ride a motorcycle.\nIt's a horse.\nIt's an iron horse.\nSo, you've got three issues here that\nyou can attract people with, and that's\nour our natural senior, which is above\nprobably anything I've ever seen in\nOntario. And you still have\naccommodations here that are absolutely\nbrilliant. The uh food, the little local\neeries, the little local uh crafts\npeople\nfourth and fifth generation people that\nhave learned their skill from their\ngrandfathers or grandmothers.\nIt's not even as far as we would have\nthought from major cities. It's a\n2 and 1/2 hours from Montreal. We're 3\nand 1/2 to 4 hours from Toronto. We're 1\nand 3/4 hours from Ottawa. And yet we\ndidn't seem to exist to a lot of people\nuntil the last few years when they had\nto drive a little bit further\nbecause the cottage country that we talk\nabout it surrounding us has been full.\nWe offer that to the people that we're\nstarting to grow here.\nNow they're starting to venture a little\nbit further north and they realize, wow,\nwhere where we have missed this one.\nThis what we're offering is the best\nkept secret. Shh, don't tell me\nthat little twisty road I was telling\nyou about, Barry's Big Road, which is\nthe next right up in this road here.\nYeah.\nIt goes right through Crooked Slide\nPark, which is a brilliant little\nstructure.\nI've heard stories of guys that they\ncome in here\nlike the 507's awesome.\nFair enough. Yeah.\nYeah. I won't be taking off as fast as\nthese guys, but that's all right. Well,\nactually, because I'm so new to riding,\nI actually just um never even drove a\ncar. So, I'm actually learning this is\nhow I got over my fear of driving.\nReally\ngetting on a motorcycle.\nAbsolutely beautiful. Yeah. And so many\nplaces to see. That's why I ride with a\ngroup.\nYeah. Southern Ontario is such a\nbeautiful part of the country and\nbeautiful roads and\ndefinitely it's great scenery. Nice\nsmooth roads.\nAbsolutely beautiful. Like driving is\njust new to me.\nI'm learning to drive.\nWell, that's impressive when you're\ndoing it on a bike.\nWhat draws you to this area? What are\nsome of your favorite roads?\nIt's just glorious roads. Just leave\nToronto about 8:00 in the morning and\nyou get back about 6:00 at night. So,\nit's a nice day out.\nIt it's sort of it's this diamond in the\nrough where certain people know about it\nand it's sort of small community now\nit's getting bigger and bigger and\nbigger. It's not that far away from the\ncity.\nNo, it's a nice day's ride.\nYeah, definitely.\nSo, it's uh it's worth it."
