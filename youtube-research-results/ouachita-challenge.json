      "description": "Video of the first 40 miles of the Ouachita Challenge Mountain Bike Race in southwest Arkansas. I've been wanting to do this race for years and finally made it out with my buddy Josh. Part of this race is on the Ouachita National Scenic Trail and the other single track is the \"Womble Trail\". The rest is gravel roads with a bit of pavement (but not much!). This race was rugged, remote, and tough. Enjoy my stupid commentary along with the beautiful views.",

      "transcript": "all right guys it's jacob so\ni did a mountain bike race not just any\nmountain bike race i did the wachita\nchallenge which\nis 60 miles\nin\nlike south\nwestern arkansas just\nbeautiful\nsuper gnarly\nrocky awesome\ntrails\ni'm gonna jump into this\ni went into this\nlike i've trained pretty well did a road\nrace earlier this year did okay\ndid a crit\nmy fitness was really good i had these\nbizarre ambitions that i was gonna come\nout here and like\ni'm thinking roadie\nyou know got good power i think mediocre\ncat three i'm gonna i'm thinking top ten\nwould be awesome\nand i have some technical skill i've\ni've won some mountain bike races um\nnothing huge but but i'm a decent\nmountain biker so i'm thinking roadie\npower\nmountain bike skill\ni'm going to excel long distance\nmountain bike race\nso my buddy josh talks me into this\nand anyway started on that road section\nand three miles in we hit this double\ntrack gravel\ni'm still be bopping along but man my\nheart rates\nlittle jack effort seems\nto really pick up when we hit this\ngravel so\num\nyou know i i knew who the guys to watch\nwere for sure\nand i thought if i can just maybe try to\nhang with these guys as long as possible\nuntil the heart rate starts to kind of\nuh get jacked and at that point i'll\nchill out so it started um first three\nmiles paved we're on this jeep road for\nabout six or seven miles\nit's like\naround a thousand feet of elevation gain\non this jeep road and we hit this first\nclimb right here\nand you're gonna start to see people\ni don't know the bungee cord is starting\nto expand right\nand i'm kind of watching the race just\nright away here but\nin my mind i'm like you know what\ni'm gonna come back and i'm gonna\ni'm gonna catch back to these dudes\nso i kind of dig pretty deep here i\nthink yeah i'm out of the saddle look at\nthat\nit's probably 600 watts probably\nso we crest over this look how beautiful\nthis place is these awesome pine trees\nbeautiful gravel roads\nand uh so i can still see them right\nthere and i'm like man i'm gonna i'm\ngonna stay with these guys so i really\npower down this hill right here try to\ncatch back up\nso back to the race i'm thinking i would\nreally love a top 10 finish here this is\ni think this is a pretty\nlegitimate mountain bike race and uh so\nwe're not even\nseven miles eight up eight miles in and\nmy dreams are being crushed i think\nthe reality is starting to set in\nthat i'm out of my league imagine that\nall right so i got back with him\nhere we are with about\na mile little less to go to the top of\nthis thousand foot\nkind of first kicker\nand i knew that there's kind of uh here\nat the end it gets pretty steep\nright before we turn off onto the single\ntrack\nso you'll start to see the bungee cord\nexpanding again\nand that's gonna pop\ni looked down on my heart rate i don't\nknow what it was it was like for me\nhigher than i'm comfortable with this\nfar into a five hour day five and a half\nhours so\nlook at that dude\ncranking away\nyeah so there they go\nat this point i've resigned that uh\nit's gonna get super steep and i'm not\ninterested\nin going that fast so\nkind of let him right away here\nwhen he kicks up\nthere's still a lot of people there\nokay so here we are a few minutes later\nwe're at the top and we're gonna turn\noff onto the\nwatchtower trail first single track nine\nmiles in i'm super pumped here\ni was just ready for something different\nnow\nyou guys rock thank y'all\nso everybody talks about yeah\neverybody talks about this trail and how\nrocky it is\ni've done a ton of long distance hiking\nout here\nnever mountain biked on it before and\npretty quickly i was humbled\ni think i could have ridden through this\nbut these dudes were getting off and so\ni i couldn't obviously ride through them\nso i hop off follow them through\nalready breathing\nsuper hard\noh yeah so i'm riding a 2010\nscott scale 29er full suspension\n12 or 13 year old bike\nman this trail is beautiful\nso\nman i was just floored\nby how many rocks there were out here\nlarge ones\nyou got these nice sections here you\nknow they were kind of pine covered\nyou know and then all of a sudden you\njust\nlike a 100 meters of just solid rocks\ni love going fast my mountain bike\nthank goodness had the stabilization\nmode on\nsuck my battery\nyeah so here's a nice section of just\nkind of some pine covered single track\num but i'm sure here in a minute we'll\njust find some random rocks\nhere's a nice little downhill section\noh\nlook at this my hands and forearms hurt\njust watching this\ni later found out my front fork was\nblocked out the first 20 miles\nand his cadence looks high\noh my gosh i talked to myself a ton\nduring the trade\nsorry my tool bag was rattling like\ncrazy\noh look at this\nthere's a really beautiful bench cut\nhere i mean this is seriously one of\njust the most beautiful\nawesome races i've ever done i've done a\nlot of really cool races this is by far\nthe coolest bike race i've ever done\nwhere's the trail there it is\noh look rocks\nman just look at the views\nit was hard to look away\nfrom the trail that is\nso much fun look at that\nhere we go a little speed\nthis is no flow though\nso we're still like in the first\n15 to 20 miles here\ndefinitely went off the trail there\nman if you're thinking about doing this\nrace in the future you know if you're\nwatching this video like man should i do\nthis race definitely do it\njust be aware i mean it is\nit's pretty tough\ni think i underestimated the amount of\nrocky single track you know on paper it\ndidn't look like a ton of single track\nlook at that\nand it wasn't\nmileage wise but time wise it was quite\na bit just because you were moving so\nslow at times\nwe haven't had any significant single\nfly single track climbs yet those are\nokay so we passed through like brushy\naid station or something at the bottom\nand then we start kind of the first\nsingle track climb and this is this just\nreally beautiful burnout section\nuh kind of some fresh fresh burn\nand while it wasn't significantly steep\nthis kind of went on for a while but um\nvery rideable\nyou know um\nmildly enjoyable\nthat's all i gotta say about that\nblowout mountain\nthis just doesn't do it justice\ni thought maybe he could have ridden\nthis it just wasn't worth it i think i\nget on right here but\nthat was brutal blowout mountain was\njust tough but here's some good flow\nfinally i'm just loving life again it\nwas like low and high\nyou know one minute i'm just like what\nam i doing in the next minute i'm just\nflying down this hill\nsuper reckless\ni think this is a decent section of\nrocks right here\nit took quite a bit of video enough that\nmy battery dies you know\njust over halfway through spoiler alert\nbut uh yeah\nyou know maybe this would be easier with\na full suspension i don't know i live in\ntexas i'm gonna say something super\ncontroversial i really don't think\nanyone in texas needs a full suspension\nmountain bike\ni know\ni know i said it\nuh or maybe i'm just old school you know\nbut uh\nyeah this would probably be more\ncomfortable on full suspension i guess i\ndon't know\nbut i'm also a roadie\nnow i admit that\noh my gosh listen to that\nit's just\nno you can't get any speed look at this\nlittle section\nlittle daggers everywhere\ngood job man\nthat little mountain goat just chugging\naway up there\ni think at this point the reality that i\nwas like\njust not\ni don't know what i was thinking here\nyou know i was trying to salvage my race\na little bit and use the fitness i had\ngained\nso i think my goal like my dream goal\nwas kind of like 5 30 i thought\nso i'm still kind of thinking about that\nhoping that's a reality\ni think finally around this point i\nrealized my my\nfork was locked out so i\nreleased my fork finally had some\nsuspension and then somewhere in here\nall of a sudden my front wheel is\nrubbing my fork i look down\nand i have a quick release viewer like i\nsaid old school\nthe skewer was undone\nand the wheel was about to fall out\ni i could have died\nlook at this what is this like a bobsled\nrun made out of rocks\ndo you see that little\namazing\nman this is just super beautiful trail\nagain i've been to spring times just\namazing like full growth\nso we are working our way down\ntowards the first or second aid station\nand here in a minute was some jeep road\ni'll just let you listen to the audio\nand stuff\noh wow\nand look at that\ncool\nwow\noh yeah my\nfront wheel was loose ready to go\nmy viewer\nhad come over\nalmost full rigid\nyou know\nbecause that's how i roll\nfull rigid\nrock\nwater\nwhat up dude\nyou having fun\nall right\nyou gotta do this next year i think that\nwas this guy's son i think he was\nchilling by the water\nyeah let me fill up on some water\ni guess i'm not going to win this after\nall\n40 miles yeah\nyeah dude like you've shot up your\nvolunteers\neverybody was just incredibly helpful\ndude what a beautiful day right yeah you\ncan't beat it right yeah i thought it\nwas gonna be cold\nright here\nawesome man i appreciate it dude no\nproblem\nthanks bud\nall right so here's the uh\nback on the single track not much jeep\nroad there and this is\njust a brutal climb\nsingle track\nagain my video here\nit just doesn't do it justice\nlisten to my breathing here\nbeautiful bench cut\ni mean just\nwhoa\ni've been doing this for you know\nseven eight nine ten minutes now and i'm\njust dying\noh back up\ni mean i'm in my\nbiggest gear i mean i'm just\ni've never used that gear in texas\nand i mean i'm using every single gear\nat this race one running one by 11 i\nthink\nlisten to that\noh man look at this is where all rocks\ncome to die\nlook at that behemoth\nall right baby\nwe are some good\nsmooth\n[Music]\ni don't have a power meter on here but\ni'm definitely doing\n350 steady\nprobably 400 who knows\ni'm trying to be conservative oh man\nwe're on paved roadway\nwelcome home baby\ndaddy found some tarmac\nthis is good i was so happy to be on a\nflat surface\njust smooth\nsmooth pavement and gravel i was just\nloving life there for a little bit\nso we go through this little town of\nsims\nsome nice road mileage you get my\naverage up to 11.\nhit that little jump there sweet jump\nand then dive off into this trail this\nlooked like something they just made a\nfew days earlier this did not look like\ni don't want to say legit trail i mean\nit's a decent little trail but it looks\nkind of fresh\nthe day before so i kind of knew what to\nexpect coming up\nincredible\noh that hit\nhow's the trail any blockages no\neverything looks really nice out there\nvery enjoyable-ish\ni don't want to give any false pretense\nthere\noh you're going to put these in my\npocket thank you so much josh there's\nour little spot over there\nwe didn't know that was trail\nwe were drinking water\nall right a little bit of deep road and\nuh we'll having to warm up\nhere in just a little bit\nhey there we go\nwe're just talking about that\n117. i'm sorry for wrapping that\nplease accept my apology\nthank you guys\nall right guys\nyeah this was the wobble was still rocky\ni would say it was not as rocky as the\nwachita\nso it was nice\na little change of pace here you know on\nsomething a little bit smoother\nflowed a little well wasn't as hilly at\nleast this this short two or three mile\nsection wasn't\num we have one more tough single track\nclimb coming up\nthat i hadn't gotten a preview\nso i'm a little worried about that but\nuh i'm still feeling pretty good\ntime's looking all right i don't know\nwhat my time is going to look like but\nthis sweet little creek crossing there\nare a lot of creeks on this section of\nthe womb at least four or five within a\nfew miles\none\nreally deep one at the end i wish i\ncould've\nall right coming back off the wall here\nforeign\nour weather was just amazing\ni wore arm warmers and pulled those down\nabout an hour now\nso there's the aid station we just hit\nup\n30 minutes before so\ncross over this highway and hop back on\nthe uh wombo single track over here\ni thought the climb was a lot\nsooner than i was how we going but just\na few miles here trail just kind of like\ntrucking away\nshould have a decent climb coming up\ni'm not looking forward to it\nbut\nshould\nbe one of the last\nsuper steep single track\ntimes\nhopefully\nall right this is it my last video\ni ran out of battery um this was the\nbeauty yeah this is beautiful\nsuper\nsuper steep difficult single track climb\ni don't say this was not as difficult as\nthe first one this one i was able to\nride the whole way i think\nbut man it was tough i had to dig\nman\nit's tough\nyou see a guy up in the distance there\ncongrats\nmountain

This was the last time I officially rode the OC because the next three years I would be directing it. If you have never experienced the Ouachita Challenge you should give it a try, it is part of the Arkansas Mountain Bike Marathon Series and is quite demanding. The OC normally takes place at the end of March each year.\n\nMTB Project: https://www.mtbproject.com/trail/7046025/ouachita-challenge-race\n\nThanks for watching",
