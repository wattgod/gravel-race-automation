      "transcript": "Ultra racing is a lot of planning,\nright? Like it's it's a mental game and\nit's just making sure you have the most\ndialed setup out there and you have a\ngood plan. I mean, I I feel like fitness\nalmost comes slightly second, you know,\nlike you could you could be the fittest\nrider out there and, you know, show up\non a gravel bike and get 30th place, you\nknow, or you could, you know, you could\nbe me riding five hours a week this\nwinter and be on a dialed rig with a\nplan and, you know, you do good, you\nknow. Yeah. I will say though, I think\nit's a good first bike packing race to\ndo. Like actually I I think you know\nAndrew really has created something\nspecial down there. It's kind of like I\nwould almost compare it to like the mids\nsouth of bike packing, right? Like he's\nhe's just created such a special\ncommunity, such a special event. You\nknow, he's there for every single\nfinisher no matter what time you finish.\nyou know, he's like sleeping on a\nsleeping pad like in the corner of a\nbarn, like waking up at 1:00 a.m. and\nrunning out there and like giving you a\nhug and having a beer with you when you\nfinish. You know, it doesn't matter, you\nknow, if you're the last place or the\nfirst place, you know, he's there. And\nyeah, I think that's why that that event\nis blowing up the way it is.\n[Music]\nfrom KM Cycling and Michigan Midpack\nMedia. Welcome to the Dirty Chain\npodcast, the podcast that covers the\ncycling scene from the viewpoint of the\nMichigan Midpack. I am your host Trevor\nand on this episode, the Ozark Gravel\nDoom with Ed\nRogers. For being an event that has only\nexisted for a few years now, Ozark\nGravel Doom, from my perspective, has\nhad immediate interest and popularity.\nUh the bike packing race ride event,\nwhatever you want to call it, out of uh\nArkansas's Ozark National Forest is\nabout 400 miles of rough forest roads,\ngravel roads, single track, and is\nfamously\nnotoriously hilly um to say the\nleast. as I followed this year's event\num which also added a shorter despair\nquote unquote despair version um that\nhas about half the length of the\nDoom. It dawned on me that I not only\nknow someone attempting Doom this year,\nbut that same person took it on last\nyear with an impressive second place\nfinish overall.\nEnter Michigan ultra endurance cyclist\nEd\nRogers. Now, I've known Ed for a few\nyears now and raced against and with him\nin a few uh different races as we talk\nabout in this episode. He is uh a true\ncharacter in the best sense of the word\num as you will hear. And not only did we\nget to hear about his experience this\nyear at Doom, uh, but because he also\ntook it on last year, we get a pretty\ncool, uh,\nperspective about the different specific\nadjustments and changes he made from one\nyear to the next to make sure that his\nrace this year was a bit more enjoyable\nand uh, and successful.\nSo, before we hear from Ed and before we\nhear about the Ozark gravel\ndoom, it occurred to me while posting\nthe last episode, the one about Midsouth\ngravel,\num that uh we now have over a hundred of\nthese episodes out of the Dirty Chain\npodcast. This episode will be the 101st.\nNow, I think that's pretty damn cool and\na bit of an accomplishment. And\nhonestly, it's because I know people\nlike you listen and get something out of\nit. Um, and that's why I continue to do\nthis. So, thank you. Thank you for\nsticking with me for 100 plus episodes.\nThank you for reaching out to me on\nsocials and at races. I always\nappreciate the feedback, the episode\nideas. um from all of you and I hope to\nkeep it\ngoing. And hey, if you do find this\nweird show that focuses on Midwest\ngravel uh beneficial or you find that it\nadds some value to your life, if you\nhave a second, if you have a little bit\nof time, uh just jump on Apple Podcasts\nor wherever you listen and write me a\nreview. It'd be super cool. And those\nlittle things make it easier for future\nlisteners to find the show and uh ensure\nthat I keep this up into the\nfuture. So, all right, enough of\nthat. Um, this one's a great one. Let's\nget right to it. The Ozark Gravel Doom\nwith Beaver Island's own Ed Rogers.\nDude, is your name Charlie? No. No.\nThat's So\nfor for some reason uh like five years\nago, I inherited one of my brother's old\niPhones and I my brother's name is\nCharlie and I've never gone back and\nchanged it. And for some reason,\nwhenever I get a new phone, it just\nkeeps transferring over. So, it's\nlike I guess my brother just owns me for\nlife or something like that. I don't\nknow.\nI I'm pretty sure there's probably an\neasy way to do it. Yeah, I I could\nchange it, but like I don't know. It's a\nIt's a good source of uh anonymity or\nwhatever, you know? That's really funny.\nWell, good morning. Good morning to you,\ntoo, man. Nice race yesterday. Oh, thank\nyou. I am a little uh wrecked this\nmorning. I will I will say I I could\nimagine. Yeah, it it brought back\nmemories of the like the beginning\nintensity of yesterday.\nThe dirty 130. Just so people listening\nknow what we're talking about.\nUm, it brought back memories of the\ntotal intensity of the couple times that\nwe did Moran 166 together where like we\nstart so hot out of the gate and I'm\njust like we're not going to do this the\nwhole time, are we? And then we just\nwe're not we're not going to do 28 miles\nan hour for eight hours.\nLuckily, there was uh I think a few\npeople yesterday\nuh put in some huge digs and then kind\nof I'm assuming regretted it because\nthey fell off a little bit, but it was\nOh, yeah. Always happens. Yeah. Yeah.\nYeah. I mean, you know, you know that\ngame, right? Oh, yeah. I'm I'm pretty\ngood at blowing myself up in the first,\nI don't know, 100 miles and then falling\napart. So,\nwell, I mean, and I think we should just\njump into it cuz we're already having\nfun, but uh yeah, like that that brings\nup like a good um let's let's talk about\nhow like we know each other and and our\nhistory as a\ncycling together. So, we mentioned the\nMoran 166. Um how many times did you do\nthat?\nI've done the 166 twice and then last\nyear I kind of created the route with\nJason, the 333. Uh I did that and I did\na pre-ride of it and I still have the\nfastest time on it. But then when it\ncame to the race, uh yeah, a lot of lot\nof stuff happened, a lot of lessons\nlearned and lost a lot of warm clothes\nthat I was needing for the night,\nneeding for the 38 degrees and rain we\nhad. And yeah, uh DNFed my first race\nthere on the race I course I created.\nThe created the f the first course you\ncreated. Uh and then you DNFED. Yeah. I\nforget I forget if I talked to Tristan\non the podcast about it, but I mean I\ndefinitely talked to Tristan a ton about\nit. Tristan Smith who uh he also took on\nthe 333 and I think he was third place,\nwasn't he? Yeah, if I remember right.\nYeah. Yeah, he was third. And it was a a\nthing where\nhe I think he he was definitely at a\npoint of wanting to quit, but he\ncouldn't figure out how to get back. So,\nthe only reason he finished is just to\nget back. My my mom was there racing the\n66. Shout out Reie for coming and saving\nme from a gas station in Manaste at 4 in\nthe morning. Oh, goodness gracious.\nYeah. Yeah. But my so my memory of you I\nthink is the first 166. Yep. And\nuh yeah you and um shoot what's Tyler\njust hammering in the front and I I kept\nthinking what are these dudes doing?\nLike you were taking like hero pulls the\nwhole time. Not only hero pulls but just\ntrying to drop everyone. Um, and then\nand I I hadn't met you two before. I\ndidn't know who you were. I mean, you\nwere riding Bearclaws and Bearclaw kits.\nAnd I just thinking, what are these guys\ndoing? I mean, they're they're either\ngoing to drop us all um or they're going\nto they're going to put themselves into\nsome trouble. And once we got onto the\nthat rough uh Oh, yeah. What do they\ncall the Jeep track or what that Yeah.\nYeah. The railroad track. The railroad\ntrack. Then I think both of you guys\nkind of fell off. Oh, yeah. I was I was\ndead at that point. Yeah. And then I\nthink I think at the um at the like kind\nof finish line post\npostra party thing, I think I had a few\nbeers and I went up to talk to you guys.\nI'm like, what was your tactic with like\nwhat were you thinking?\nAnd and I think I remember you\nspecifically were like, I don't think we\nwere thinking. We just wanted a hammer.\nYeah. I mean, me and Tyler, I mean, we\ngo out on I mean, I live back in\nTraverse City now, so we're we're going\nto probably do some more big dumb rides\nthis summer, but I mean, we like to just\nme and him just go out, man, and get in\nthe arrow bars and just absolutely will\nhammer for like 8 to 10 hours. I mean,\nthat's kind of our kind of our thing.\nYeah. I don't know if it's effective\ntraining, but it's something. And to be\nfair, you guys can hammer. I mean, Tyler\nis such a he's a beast. And uh and you\ntoo, man. I mean like the I mean we'll\ntalk about like the the success you've\nhad but um yeah you you mentioned you\nwere up in uh Moran um for quite a few\nyears working for Bearclaw. Now you're\ndown in Traverse City doing some other\nthings. So uh yeah going back to school\nyou know bike industry is kind of right\nnow. I mean, I wouldn't say it's at a\ndecline, but it's kind of at a stil like\nYeah. Like midsummer, I like saw the\nsigns and I was like, man, it's time to\ntime to go back to engineering school.\nSo, yeah. What What are you like 19, 20?\nLike I mean, you're a young guy. So, no,\nI'm I'm going to be 24 here in Oh, man.\nweek or two. So, yeah, I know. I'm\ngetting I'm getting old, man.\nSo, I think like in uh I'm trying to\nthink if this timing works\nout, but were you telling me about your\nfirst Doom experience? So, like we we\nmet up up in uh Marquette after or\num and I think even then I was like,\nman, I I got to figure out how to get Ed\non the podcast cuz you're you're a good\nstoryteller and I don't know, you you\nyou get yourself get yourself into some\nfun situations.\nBut, um you So, 2023 you took you did\nthe uh Ozark Gravel Doom. Am I saying\nthat right? Ozark Graal Doom. Is that\nhow you got it? Okay, you got it. So,\nyou did it 2023 and then this year in\nMarch you took it on for the second\ntime. Um,\nso I don't know if you know this off\nhand. I was looking back at results. Has\nthat race like it's crazy because I know\nthat um if you just follow cycling or\nultra distance cycling like that thing\nhas become super popular in the last\ncouple years. Oh, I mean it's it's like\ngetting like actual media attention. I\nmean, there's like four or five\nphotographers there. You had Patrick\nfrom like Bikes or Death there. I mean,\nyep. Yeah. You know, bikepacking.com\narticles and, you know, all that kind of\nstuff. So, I mean, it's it's definitely\ngetting it's getting popular. I mean,\nit's sold out. It's sold out like a\ncouple weeks into Regge and he had to he\nwas able to expand the field to let more\npeople in. But, I mean, it is a it's a\nit's a happening race now. So, if you if\nyou like So, it's all in Arkansas,\nright? Or do you like do you kind of\nlike go into any other states or it's\nall like No, it's all all in the Ozark\nNational Forest down there. Yeah. Okay.\nAnd um\nand there's the Doom which is like 400\nplus miles and Yep. I saw that like\nDespair was that new this year or has\nthat always been No, uh Despair was this\nwas the first year for it 200 a 200 mile\noption. A little shorter. Yeah. If you\ngo on the website, um, just as I was\ndoing like my quick research before this\nconversation, it's like\nthere's not much information about it.\nIt It seems It seems like they're like,\n\"Here's the race. Uh, you might want to\nride a hard tail mountain bike. It's\nhard.\" Um, and then here are some\nresults. And I guess like this gets back\nto like the original question. I only\nsaw results going back a few years. Has\nit only been since like 2022 or So this\nwas this was the third year of the\nevent. Okay. Okay. Yep. Y crazy. Yeah. I\nSo the\nroute does it stay the same? Does it is\nit the does it change? I mean like so\nwhat you did 2023 versus 20 24\nit has gotten progressively harder.\nThat's what I'll say. I mean, and what\nhave they added added just like\ndifferent sections? So, he he\nkeeps Yeah. The first year it was like\n370 miles, right? Oh, gotcha. And then\nthe second year it's like 395 and then\nthis year it's 409 with single track.\nSo, it's it's just a slow progression. I\nmean, the more the more Andrew, the race\ndirector down there, the more he rides\ndown there and like learns the area, I I\nmean, he just he just keeps throwing in\nnew new stuff. And I mean, it gets I can\nonly expect next year it's going to be\neven more rowdy. So Oh, goodness. So\nthat that makes sense why the like a\nhard tail mountain bike was was a\nsuggestion.\nUm, yeah. I mean, I I I guess if you\nwant to talk like bike setup, I mean,\nlike the first year I showed up to that,\nI rode my my Bearclaw Thunderhawk with I\nhad a prototype frame that could fit 2.2\nin tires, like maxed out, you know, and\nthat was possibly the dumbest thing I've\never done in my bike racing career. Uh,\nmy hands just didn't work. I mean, I was\nI was so fatigued and beat up after\nthat. I had a massive 40 to chain ring\nwith like a, you know, a mountain bike\ncassette out back and I was like, \"Oh,\nthis will be enough.\" You know, I was\njust completely underestimating it and\nshowed up and oh man, I I walked so much\nthat year and then I was like, \"I'm not\ndoing that again.\" So this year I showed\nup with a full suspension mountain bike\nwith an embarrassingly small chain ring\non the front, dropper post, like the\nfull setup. And I mean, it was it was so\ngood, dude. I I wouldn't do it on\nanything other than a full suspension. I\nmean, yeah. So, tell talk about the\nterrain. I mean, that's I think we'll\nget into a little more about like bike\nsetup, but yeah. Tell help me understand\nthe type of terrain. I mean, I'm I think\nwhat I've heard about that area is\nare the climbs like really steep and\nrelentless? Um, do you have any like\nreal sustained climbs? And then what\nkind of a what kind of gravel slash um\nsurface are you are you dealing with?\nMan, I would\nsay I would say the gravel there the the\nmajority of the gravel is going to be\nlike those those railroad tracks you you\nremember in Moran, right? So it's like\nit's like not nice gravel. Like if you\nrun 40s, you're going to hate your life,\nyou know?\nBut yeah, I mean like sustained grades\nof like 20 to 30% for your climbing. And\nI mean nothing there. You you're never\nreally climbing for I'd say more than 30\nto 40 minutes, I'd say. So, you know,\nnothing nothing crazy in terms of like\nbig climbs, but I mean they're just\nshort and they're steep and you don't\nget a break really like you got to be\nfocused on the descents or you're going\nto crash, you know? Like Yeah. Just\nreally really chunky gravel. Yeah. I\nyeah I see like so for this\nyear if it was a 400 plus mile race ride\nadventure whatever you would call it\num it has you at like 47,000 ft of\nelevation which yeah I was like 47\n47,000 something for my elevation. Yeah.\nOh my god. Yeah. So, I mean, but still\nlike those are those are decently long\nclimbs, even 30 40 minutes. I mean,\nyou're not climbing miles, but um yeah,\nand the thing is too, it's not like\nyou're it's the climbing is so loose,\nright? And that's where that's where\nlike I feel like the gravel bike is like\nnot a not a good choice, right? Because\nit you're just losing rear wheel\ntraction the whole time, you know?\nAnd yeah, I mean th this will probably\nmake a lot of sense to you, but uh maybe\nsome other people listening, but you\nknow that descent in Margie right after\nthe power lines, you know, you're coming\ninto like Ishkame. Yeah. You know what\nI'm about maybe? And it's like, you\nknow, loose chunky rocks. It's pretty\nsteep and there's that sharp right hand\nat the bottom. Yep. That's that's what a\nlot of the descents are like. Oh jeez.\nYeah. So, I mean it's it's just, you\nknow, you'll have your nice your nice\ngravel there will be like, you know, you\nknow, chunky Midwest gravel, you know,\nnothing nothing too crazy. You know,\nthat's probably a majority of it. But\nthen you'll get you'll get into like\nfour or five inch just like sharp mean\nrocks that you're riding through and\nlike, you know, off-roading trails that\npeople take their four-wheel rigs on,\nyou know. Did you Yeah. You said you had\ndropper this year. Did you had a\ndropper? Did you put a dropper on your\nyour gravel bike? Uh, no. I was I last\nyear was like, man, I was like just like\nstraight post sending it like just you\nknow getting wild on the on the grapple\nbike. It was it was not it was not\nsmart. Yeah.\nSo talk to me, tell me about um the the\ntype like how different people approach\nthis because um my guess is by the way\nthat you finished last year and this\nyear. So last year you came in second\nplace overall. Y this year you get\nfourth place. Fourth place. Y so I mean\nyou're you're riding hard and I'm I'm\nassuming that you're you're wanting to\ndo well if not win it. Um, y but it's\nbranded, as I look at it, as like a bike\npacking\nultraistant.\nUh, and and I I hesitate to say race,\nbut it some I feel like some people use\nit some people treat it as a race and\nsome people maybe just treat it as a as\na goal/event. Um, yeah. So, like how is\nthat vibe when you get down there when\nyou like are is it like half and half or\nsome people trying to Yeah. Like how\ndoes that I would say pro I mean this\nthis race I feel like I feel like most\npeople there are there to like push\nthemselves and actually go pretty quick,\nbut then I mean you have you can tell at\nthe start who's going to be out there\nracing and who's going to be out there\nhaving a good time and like cooking\nmeals on top of mountains and stuff and\nsleep, you know? Uh like there was like\nthe the the person who came uh you know\ntook the longest time out there this\nyear was out there for six days. They\nwere just like having a good time and\ncamping I guess\nand like I'm showing up with like a down\njacket to sleep in, you know. So yeah, I\nmean are there require are there\nrequirements like you have to bring so\nmuch um gear or are they just like you\nbetter have this gear so you don't Last\nyear last year he had a mandatory gear\nlist with like you know you had to have\na water filter, you had to have rain\ngear and all that stuff which I think is\ngood but this year he he didn't have\nthat at all. So, you know, you could you\ncould do with whatever you were\ncomfortable with, which I mean, no rain\nin the forecast, so it's like, do you\nreally need your rain pants and your\nshoe covers and, you know, waterproof\ngloves and all that stuff? And it's\nlike, you know, you kind of kind of\nchoose what you want to do there. Yeah.\nSo, you\nyou packed light this year and last\nyear, I'm assuming you packed as light\nas you could. Did you plan on\nboth years? Did was there a plan to stop\nand sleep? Was what? How do you How do\nyou like for this event race\nspecifically like Yeah. Do you plan to\nrace and sleep or sleep? Do you plan to\nHow do you How do you do your nutrition?\nAre there places where you can gas\nstations and and things? Okay. Yeah. I\nguess I'll I'll get into sleep first.\nYeah. Yeah. Oh, you're good. Like, so\nlast year I didn't plan on sleeping at\nall. like I was just running it straight\nthrough and you know I took like some\nnaps on the side of the road for like\nyou know 5 10 minutes and just kept\ngoing which I don't feel like that's the\nsmartest strategy like it gets I rode\ninto a ditch because I fell asleep last\nyear you know I was like in the arrow\nbars falling asleep and I wrote into a\nlike not not smart and I don't actually\nthink it's faster like pushing that\nsleep you know deprivation thing I mean\nyeah it might get you the win, but I\ndon't think it's I don't think it's\nreally safe or healthy. But yeah, so\nthis year I came into it with a little\ndifferent strategy. Definitely planning\non sleeping this year. And I mean the\nthe first night I slept 3 hours this\nyear, which you know was kind of crazy.\nLike you wake up and you check the\ntracker and like 15 people have passed\nyou while you slept three hours the\nfirst night, you know. But uh I think it\ndefinitely it definitely helped on the\nyou know the remainder of the race. you\nknow, you're not you're not as tired,\nyou know. I was I was able to finish\nstrong and push really hard, you know.\nSo, I I think Yeah, for me at least,\nsleeping sleeping is important. That's\ngood. That's that's that's cool. And\nlike cool to see like, you know,\nlearning from past experiences. Yeah. I\nmean, a Dexter, the guy who won this\nyear, he didn't I think he took like\nmaybe a five minute nap at the most, you\nknow, he was just just hammering out\nthere, which I mean, I did that last\nyear. It works, but like Yeah, it can\nget a little sketchy. For sure. For\nsure. Yeah. Um Okay. And then uh yeah,\ntalk about food and nutrition or how you\nlike how much do you start with and then\nare there reup reup spots? Yeah. So, so\nlast year uh I took way too much food.\nLike I ended with like 5 lbs of food on\nmy bike,\nwhich isn't like a ton, but when you\nstart thinking about the fact that you\nhave to climb up 30% grades for 2 days\nstraight, uh that weight really starts\nto add up. I mean, that that turns into\nI mean, if you do the math on it, that's\nturning into like 30 minutes to an hour.\nYou're just wasting because you're\ncarrying all this extra weight. So, this\nyear, I definitely went on the lighter\nside of food. So, I started with 7,000\ncalories this year, which sounds like a\nlot, but it's not really. I mean, that\ngoes pretty fast when you're riding 24\nhours straight, you know? Yeah. Uh, but\nlike resupplies, which you in this race,\nif you're going fast, uh, like you have\nto basically do a 200 mile push at the\nend of the race. You know, there's\nyou're going to hit the resupplies when\nthey're closed a lot of the time. Uh,\nyou know, primarily because it's on\nEaster weekend, which I think is kind of\nfunny. I almost think Andrew does that a\nlittle bit on purpose to like make the\nrace a little harder, you know, like you\ncan't get food out there, you know? It's\na a self-supported event, so you got to\nyou got to rely on, you know,\nrestaurants and gas stations and all\nthat. And I mean, you're you're really\nout there. I mean, there's there's a few\ngas stations, a few restaurants, and\nthat's it. And you got to hit them at\nthe right time or bring enough food to,\nyou know, make it. Yeah. So, yeah. So,\nyou started with 7,000 calories. Like,\nwhat was that?\nWhat in what way? In what form were\nthose calories? Yes.\nI do I do like 100% like real actual\nfood for these races. Like, some people\ncan get away with the sports nutrition\nand, you know, stuff like that. But for\nme, uh I'll just do like a ton of\ncookies. I'll make like, you know, a nut\nmix. uh you know my like homemade\ngranola bars, stuff like that. Uh I just\nfind it it works a lot better on the\nstomach to not be you know downing pure\nsugar for two days straight, you know?\nSo yeah, and then like if I come across\na gas station out there, I'm going to\ngrab some water, grab some snacks of\nlike the same variety that I started\nwith and yeah, hit up a restaurant or\ntwo. Get some get some barbecue down\nthere. Yeah. Oh man, the great the great\nuh tie for first through 12th place. I\nmean, we all the the top 12 of us all\nstopped and got barbecue on the first\nday.\nSo, yeah, I mean, yeah, just just\ngetting real food out there, I think, is\nthe most important. Yeah, for sure. And\nthen carrying enough I mean, yeah,\nhaving\num sometimes like pure water too instead\nof I mean, if you do like any of the\nsugary stuff. I mean I like yesterday I\njust did pure not pure water but like\nevery just like all my liquid was also\nmy nutrition and that that works for\nlike a five six hour push but I can't\nimagine doing that for it's actually\ninteresting though because Megan the\nMegan who finished uh third overall this\nyear first female um she was like I\nthink she had like five or 7,000\ncalories in drink mix And you know, I\nthink it paid off for her because she it\nworked really well for her and she\ndidn't have to stop at like that first\nbarbecue stop where all the 12 top 12\nmen were. Like she just cruised right on\nby it and like went into first place\nbecause she brought like I mean just\nthousands of calories of food with her.\nSo I mean it works for some people. I\nmean she did it on mostly drink mix for\nthe entire thing which is impressive but\nI Yeah. I don't know. Yeah. That's I\nmean it's it's just one of those things\ntoo like what works for you if you can\nstomach all that and I don't know how\none\num really prepares their body and I mean\nyou can you can do long single day rides\nbut you don't know what your body's\ngoing to do after 48 hours of drinking\nthe same drink mix you know. Yeah. Yeah.\nI mean, it's definitely uh you got to\nyou got to experiment with it so you're\nnot experimenting with it out there in\nthe middle of the forest at night, you\nknow. Yeah. So, tell me about like\nyour Let's get a little more into your\nrace experience or I mean, you uh hinted\non a couple like scary things two years\nago where you fell asleep. Um, I'm sure\nthere were there were more moments like\nthat. Or were there moments like that\nthis year? Not necessarily sleeping, but\njust like, yeah, you were like, \"Oh\n[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like what what am I doing?\" Or or\ndid everything go pretty much to plan?\nActually, this year I spent way more\ntime like just like talking to friends\nbeforehand, people who've done the race\nand and you know, just like we had like\na group chat going for like three months\nbefore the race and just like talking\nbetweens ourselves, you know, like\nfiguring out bike setup, you know,\nnutrition, sleeping plan, all that\nstuff. And I mean, for me personally, I\ndid so much planning that it actually\nkind of went off without like a hitch or\nanything. I mean, it was like it was\nlike perfect except for, you know, my\nfitness not being the greatest this\nyear, which, you know, I kind of blew up\non the first day and kind of had to\nrecover after that. But, I mean, besides\nthat, I mean, every I mean, bike setup,\nnutrition, all that stuff worked pretty\nwell this year. Yeah, that's awesome.\nYou did like your Strava\num like uh\nwill you like reiterate how you\nexplained it on your Strava? how it was\nlike instead of just one big race, you\nkind of looked at it in three different\nparts. Will you kind of explain how that\nwent? I I definitely didn't plan on it\nbeing like three parts, but it it kind\nof worked out that way. Like the the\nfirst part, I mean, I was leading the\nrace for the first, you know, 80 miles\nthat day. Uh I think that was mostly\nthat wasn't really like how fast I was\ngoing like per se on like all the\ngravel. I think that was mostly so 10\nmiles in you hit the first single track\nsection. And this isn't like nice vosand\nsingle track. This is like Margie Gix\nstyle single track. And you know if you\ncome into that on a a gravel bike or\neven like a hard tail mountain bike,\nyou're going slow. And you know I'm on a\n120 120 full suspension and you know I'm\ncoming out of that with 15 20 minutes on\neveryone else. You know it's a 9 mile\nsection of single track. like I'm I'm\ngoing fast through there and I think\nthat's where my my lead was really\nestablished and you know I held that for\nlike 80 miles until I really started to\nblow up you know it was down there. I\nmean it was we're we're talking like 80\n85 degrees and you're like out in the\nsun climbing up a gravel road at 2 miles\nan hour, you know. So, like real quick\nand keep like I just just a real quick\ninter interruption, but 80 miles to me\nlike that could be anywhere from if you\nride 80 miles down here that'd be 4\nhours, but like what's the time period?\nIs that like eight hours of riding or\nYeah. So, that that first section I was\naveraging about 13.2, right? Okay. So, a\nlittle little less than eight hours, but\nstill like that's a long 80 miles. Yeah.\nYeah. And it's a and 13.2 miles an hour\nthere on that train is like you're going\nhard. You're not going easy. Like like\nthat would be like that'd be like a 20\n21 mph average on like a Michigan gravel\nroad on a gravel bike. Like you're\nyou're not going easy. You're like\npushing low tempmpo pace, you know? Uh\nso that's what I did for the first day.\nprobably not the smartest move, but\nafter that I kind of had to settle into\nlike a I don't know, let's just like\nhave fun and finish this thing kind of\npace, you know? So, you know, rode with\nfriends, stopped and got barbecue on the\nfirst day, slept for 3 hours, you know,\njust like Yeah, I kind of switched into\njust a like a party pace, have a good\ntime mode, you know, and did that until,\nyou know, second day or no, actually the\nthird day. I did that until Sunday\nmorning at like 1:00 a.m., right?\nAnd uh that's when I I put it in Strava\nRampage the finale where I I like came\nback and I don't know I was I woke up\nfrom a little nap on the side of the\nroad and I had had like a caffeine pill\nand I was like I don't know man just\ngoing so hard to finish and I I wanted\nto see if I could catch everyone and\nyeah I knew I wasn't going to catch\nfirst place but I knew there was a there\nwas a good chance I could get back to\nlike second place which you know didn't\nwork out but I still caught still caught\nsix people in the in the rampage at the\nend. How how far of a distance or\ndistance slash time was the final\nrampage?\nUh yeah, that was so from 1:00 a.m.\nuntil about I think I finished at like\n9:30, 10 in the morning. So Okay. Uh\nabout about nine and a half hours of\njust like Yeah. Absolutely going as hard\nas I could. And yeah, there were kind of\ntwo reasons for that. One is like I\ncouldn't get any food out there and I\nwas running out of food. Uh yeah, a\nsurvival a survival necessity.\nIf I go faster, I'll finish faster and\nthen I can get food. So that was kind of\nthat was kind of a driving factor there.\nAnd you know, also just I' I've noticed\nthe thing too with me like if I'm if I'm\nriding by myself in an ultra race, I'm\ngoing to push myself way harder, right?\nAnd if I'm riding with other people, I\nkind of like make friends and like want\nto hang out, which is definitely to my\ndetriment sometimes. Like, you know,\nlike if I'm riding with someone, someone\ncan can totally convince me to down for\n30 minutes and like eat food or like,\nyou know, sleep for 3 hours, you know?\nBut if I'm riding by myself, I'm just\nlike, I don't know, like get in a zone\nand just go really really hard. So,\nyeah. I mean, and that's and that's fine\nif that's your goal, right? If your goal\nis to just hang with friends, then\nperfect. But if you're I mean, obviously\nyou went down there to see how well you\ncould do and uh and not make friends.\nNo, just joking.\nWell, that Yeah, that was that was kind\nof a problem, too, is like I I picked up\nfriends in Chicago and we drove down\ntogether. My friend Zena, who's actually\nwon the race before the first Yeah,\nZeno. Yeah, we were\nuh we we we got barbecue together and\nthen like after that we were rolling\ndown to the the Tat Shack which is the\nTrans-American Trail. It's for like\nmotorcyclist. They can sleep there and\nyou know it's like a little house. So\nwe're like we we camp up there for 3\nhours the first night which is I mean a\nquestionable decision for you know both\nof us you know trying to be competitive\nin the race\nand we're like yeah we're both tired you\nknow we just ate a bunch of food and\nthere's a there's a house here we can\nsleep in so let's sleep here you know.\nYeah. Yeah. Like he he convinced me to\nsleep there for three hours which like\nyou know Yeah. If you're trying to win\nthe race that's not the best move.\nYeah, definitely.\nUm, talk let's let's get into your gear\na little bit. You you talked about your\nbike and everything last year. Um, and\nthen this year you went full suspension.\nWhat what kind of bike was it? Yeah. So,\nAllied BC40. I got that bike this year.\nOh, man. Nice. Oh, yeah. That that thing\nis that thing is badass, man. So, I\nmean, yeah. Shimano XTXTR drivetrain on\nit. Uh, you know, stupid light carbon\nwheels on it. Uh, yeah, I said 120\nsuspension. I mean, basically like just\nlike the dream XC race bike. Uh,\nand yeah, I mean 21 and a half pounds\nunloaded. So, yeah, it's it's really\nlight. And then yeah, in terms of like\nother gear and stuff I had on there, I\nhad like, you know, just the super light\npuffy jacket, rain jacket, you know, all\nyour tools, you know, tons of tools cuz\nI mean, like anything can happen out\nthere. Like I tell people that are\ncoming to this race and never done it\nbefore, it's like, yeah, you're going to\nwant like multiple tubes, you're going\nto want extra spokes, you know, patch\nkit, all the sewing needle to sew your\nsidewalls if you tear them on the rocks\ndown there. So yeah, super comprehensive\nlike tool kit and stuff and then uh\nyeah, other than that just like food and\nyou know like some extra gloves and\nstuff. I I forgo the water filter this\nyear. Uh the water down there is like\nlike actually really nice and as long as\nyou don't get it below a farm. I I just\ndrink it right out of the creeks which\nis probably not the\nbest. It It saves a couple hundred grams\non a water filter and it saves some\ntime. So, I I didn't bring a water\nfilter this year.\nUh yeah, I know I'm I'm probably dumb.\nPeople will tell me that. But yeah, it\nworked. I didn't I didn't get any any\ndiseases or anything like that. So,\nyeah. Uh yeah. And that's that's really\npretty much it I brought with me. I\nmean, like navigation and, you know,\ntracker and all that stuff, too. But\nyeah, I didn't I didn't really bring\nlike a full-on sleep setup or, you know,\ncooking stuff, you know, it's not really\nthat kind of race. So, Sure. Yeah. Yeah.\nUm, what uh what tires were the tires of\nchoice? I mean, you having the\nexperience last year and then going I'm\nassuming like 2.4s or something. What\nwere you What were you riding? I wish I\nI did uh 225 Aspens this year, which if\nI did it again, I would run a 24 like\n100%. Like these like you're climbing at\nlike 2 miles an hour, right? So like\naerodynamics aren't even like a concern,\nyou know, uh of like a big tire or even\nlike the weight or the rolling\nresistance of it. like traction is way\nmore important at climbing 2 m an hour\nand then you go downhill at, you know,\n20 to 40 m an hour downhill on gravel.\nSo big tires are definitely your friend\nfor sure. And yeah, I mean like you\nbasically want a mountain bike, a\nmountain bike tire. So would would you\nhave ridden the same setup or suggest\nthe same setup if there was no single\ntrack too? You think the Absolutely. I\nmean, like I was joking to one of my\nfriends as we were riding. It's like I\nhadn't even hit the single track yet and\nI'd already used several inches of the\ntravel of my full suspension like and my\nI've already used my dropper and I\nhaven't even hit the single track that's\nlike 10 miles in yet. It's like this is\nnot a gravel race. This is this is like\na I don't know. It's It's just not a\ngravel race for sure. Yeah, I mean the\nfull suspension is just so nice. Like\nhaving the traction to climb and descend\nand just like Yeah. You you don't even\nhave to slow down, you know? You can\njust bomb the hills. Yeah. Yeah. That's\ngreat. like other people out there like\non a salsa cutthroat or something. The\nguy who won Dexter was on a cutthroat\nwith like a small chain ring too and uh\nyou know he had to like walk up the\nhills you know cuz he's losing traction\non the rear and he's I mean clearly much\nstronger than me and uh like I didn't\nwalk any hills. I rode like the entire\ncourse without walking, which I I\ntotally contribute that to the to the\nfull suspension, just having all that\ntraction, you know?\nYeah. Yeah, that's that's cool. Um, did\nyou say I think I skipped over it\nquickly. Did you say it was like really\nhot or was it really hot last year? No,\nit I mean it's been hot both years. So,\nI mean, like Arkansas, like midday in\nthe spring, it's like it's it's like\nreal real hot. I mean, you're talking 80\nprobably pushing 90s in the sun. And\nyeah, as a as a Michigan boy coming out\nof winter, I mean, that doesn't work too\nwell\nusually. Uh, at least this year I\nremembered my sunscreen. Last year, I\nforgot the sunscreen in my car. Oh,\njeez.\nBut yeah, it's it's it's hot and then it\ngets cold at night, too. So, you know,\nyou're you're down into the 40s at\nnight. So, yeah. Are you are you like in\num is it are it's basically like forest\nthe whole time? you're not like in in an\nopen anything open like um you might so\nlike you you'll do like a climb and\nyou'll pop out on a ridge line and it'll\nbe kind of like farmland, you know, and\nyou'll get a little bit of open area,\nbut you're never you're never really out\nin the open for maybe more than a mile\nor two at a time. Okay. Before you're\nyou're back in like, you know, just like\ngood tree cover and stuff. Yeah. Gotcha.\nSo, you're definitely in the forest.\nYeah. Yeah. Um, and\nthen how many people start this thing\nand how many people is there a big DNF\nrate or Yeah. Uh, this year was actually\npretty good. I think I think the\nmajority of people actually finished\nthis year. Uh, I think we had like\nprobably like\n110ish people that actually showed up,\nyou know, split between the two\ncategories. So, I think we had like 40\nto 50 doing Doom and like 60 doing the\nthe shorter route. And yeah, I don't\nthink I don't think the scratch rate was\nas high this year. Okay. I mean, yeah, I\nthink I think people just are, you know,\ngetting more of an idea of what the\nevent actually is and they're coming\nprepared now. You know, people aren't\nshowing up on their gravel race bikes\nwith 40s anymore. And, you know, like if\nyou did that, I would I would probably\nwant to quit, too.\nbecause that would that would be a\nspecial experience for sure.\nAs as you know uh uh firsthand about\nwell I guess you didn't have 40s but I\ndidn't have 40s but I still had a rigid\nbike with drop bars and\nyeah that was not recommended. Not\nrecommended for sure.\nWhat is it? Um, going all the way back\nto the beginning, like\nuh you were you were riding some fast\nuh gravel races and I really thought\nthat maybe your direction would be just\nto kind of hammer these gravel races and\nbe like more of a like the next the next\nbig gravel dude in uh in Michigan. And\nuh then I feel like you kind of went to\nthis like whole ultra distance thing\nwhich is super cool too. But what what\nis it about the ultradistant\num uh events and adventures that that\nbrings you to that instead of um yeah\nyou know doing Barry Rubet 100 to uh\nnext week. Yeah, I feel like it's not\nYeah, I was good at it. I was good at\ndoing the shorter gravel races, right?\nLike, you know, as you said in the\nbeginning, like me and Tyler, I mean,\nwe're both like power animals in the\narrow bars and we can like, you know,\nsmash out big power for eight hours\nstraight, you know, but I don't know. I\ndid I didn't\nreally I don't I don't really find that\nmuch enjoyment from racing for, you\nknow, that 8 to 12 hour range or even\nshorter. Uh I mean, unless it's like a\nshorter mountain bike race, you know. I\nI guess really I'm like deep down inside\nI've always been a mountain biker and\nlike the gravel thing was kind of just\nlike a thing when I worked at\nBarrackclaw and you know we had like the\nteam going then and you know that was\nthat was a cool cool experience but like\nreally deep down I've always been a\nmountain biker and kind of finding\nevents that you know combine the really\nlong you know efforts that I find that\nI'm actually pretty good at. you know,\nlike two days into a race, I can, you\nknow, absolutely hammer still. Like I I\nstill don't really understand that. But\nlike, yeah, I I find I'm good past two\ndays on the bike and I can still go fast\nand go fast off road. So, combine those\nthose two things together and yeah, I'm\nfinding myself at events like Doom and\nstuff. So, yeah. Well, I mean, and then\nthat leads to the next question, like\nwhat else? I mean maybe this year or in\nsubsequent years like like what else can\nwhat else are you thinking about doing?\nI mean are are you do you have tour\ndivide in your head? Do you have some of\nthese other crazy um Yeah. What what\nYeah. What are you thinking about? I\nmean for the rest of this year I don't I\ndon't really have I thought about doing\nMargie out and back but I don't know. I\nhave I have feelings about Todd's\nevents. I know some people love them,\nbut like I don't really want to be\nsearching for Dum Dums at three in the\nmorning. I don't I I don't know that.\nWe'll we'll see. It's It's not out of\nthe cards, but I I might try to find my\nway into that race because I think I\ncould do I could do pretty well there.\nUh but besides that, I'm I'm going down\nto Indiana in September and racing uh a\nfriend's downount race, I think. Yeah.\nWho's your down country? Uh, I think you\nactually he mentioned he met you before,\nJesse Smith. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\nYeah. He's putting on a a first year\nevent down there in September and I'm\ngonna be going down there and trying to\ngo fast there and then uh yeah, besides\nthat, maybe hop in a few uh mountain\nbike races this summer. But yeah, other\nthan that, nothing really nothing really\ncrazy planned for this year. But I mean,\nideally, I do want to get out and do\nlike Colorado Trail Race and Arizona\nTrail Race cuz I think I could again do\nreally really well at those races. You\nknow, I' I've found that I do pretty\nwell at altitude. You know, being a\nMidwestern boy my whole life, you know,\nsome reason I do pretty well at it, but\nyou know, like long distance, multiple\ndays and, you know, technical riding\nseems to be my seems to be my strong\nsuit. you know, not getting getting out\nof the arrow bars and, you know,\ndrafting other people. I mean, it's it's\nfun and all, but like I don't know. I\nfind I find more more joy from riding my\nmountain bike out in the middle of the\nwoods, you know. Yeah, for sure. Yeah.\nAnd I think I think you would do really\nwell at that. And I would like to see\nyou take those on, you know, multiple\nday. I don't What is Colorado Trail? How\nhow long is that? That's what that's a\nlittle over 500 miles. And you know, I\nbelieve the FKT on it is right around\nlike the four day mark. So, I mean, I\ndon't I don't think I could I don't\nthink I could get close to that. I mean,\nI would probably be in the five to six\nday range, you know, just not not living\nat altitude, but like Yeah, but it would\nit would be\nsomething it would be more than you\nwould ever have ever done yet, right?\nLike\nDoom is the probably the longest. That's\nYeah, Doom is the longest single push\nI've done without like, you know,\ncamping overnight or something like\nthat. Sure. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Well, cool.\nI think Well, let me encourage you to\nget to that point because I think it\nwould be really cool. Um there's like I\ndon't know. I I did kind of want to ask\nand I mean I don't know if there's any\ngood answer to it, but like just the\ntraining to get to that. I think you can\nyou can train so much. I don't know if\nthere's any real good answers. You can\ntrain so much, but your body just has to\nbe ready. Some people are built for\nthose like multiple day things and some\npeople just aren't. And yeah, I mean, I\ndon't know if you do anything specific\nto to train or do you? Um, yeah, like\nlike last year, I don't know if you\nfollowed me on Straa last year. I mean,\nlast year I put in like some this like\nabsolutely insane fat bike base mile\nseason up in the UK. I was doing like 20\nto 25 hour weeks on a fat bike and I did\nnot do that this year. I was which which\nis really interesting because this year\nI averaged the same speed at Doom with a\nthird of the training, right? Which I\nkind of attribute some of that to like\nthe bike, you know, the bike just being\nso fast out there. But also, it it kind\nof makes me wonder like are is all that\nunless you're like truly like at the\nhighest level and that's your job,\nright? And you have the time to recover\nfrom that amount of training. I've\nalmost found now that like shorter\nintensity, 5 to 10 hours a week is\nactually better for like most people.\nLike if you have a normal job, you can't\ndo 20 25 hours a week. I mean, you\nyou're going to be so tired, so burnt\nout, which got me last year. And yeah,\nit it's kind of interesting that like a\nthird of the training still got me, you\nknow, into the into the top five, which\nyeah, I don't know if it's I don't know\nif it's bike setup, just like having\nmore experience, or whether or not, you\nknow, all that extra training really\ndoesn't do that much, you know? I don't\nknow, Ed. I just what I hear is you're\njust getting smarter and smarter each\nyear. You know, you get older, you're\nlike what, 25 now? You're an old man.\nLast year you made some mistakes and\nthis year you're just you're just a\nsmart bike racer.\nYeah. I Yeah, I would say it's a lot of\nultra racing is a lot of planning,\nknow. Yeah. So, yeah. Yeah. It's a It's\nan interesting sport. It's it's\ndefinitely different from uh you know\nlike Barry or something like that where\nthat's like totally a fitness race and\nlike you know knowing how to ride in the\npack and like all that stuff you know\nit's a it's a totally different game for\nsure. For sure. Yeah. Well, cool man.\nThis is great. I've Yeah. I I wanted to\nI don't know enough about Doom and again\nlike like I said I just see so much\nabout it now. It seems like it's like\nreally blown up and then like sounds\nlike you're gonna need to load up that\nSanta Cruz blur you have with some bike\nnext year and hitch a ride down there\nand find out what it's about. Man, I\nmean I'm not opposed to it. There's some\nthere's some things that I'll hear about\nand be like not for me. But there's but\nI will say though I think it's a good\nfirst bike packing race to do. Like\nactually I I think you know Andrew\nreally has created something special\ndown there. It's kind of like I would\nalmost compare it to like the mids south\nof bike packing, right? Like he's he's\njust created such a special community,\nsuch a special event. You know, he's\nthere for every single finisher no\nmatter what time you finish. you know,\nhe's like sleeping on a sleeping pad\nlike in the corner of a barn, like\nwaking up at 1:00 a.m. and running out\nthere and like giving you a hug and\nhaving a beer with you when you finish.\nYou know, it doesn't matter, you know,\nif you're the last place or the first\nplace, you know, he's there. And yeah, I\nthink that's why that that event is\nblowing up the way it is. You know, he's\nhe's uh definitely got something going\non down there. Yeah, that's awesome.\nThat's cool. Well, yeah, I I'm I'm kind\nof interested. I know Tristan has been\nthat's been on his bucket list for a\nwhile, too. So, maybe maybe Tristan and\nI we'll get Sebastian, our other buddy\nhere, and maybe we'll just have to to\nmake it a thing next year or something.\nSo, thanks.\nIt'd be awesome. Cool. Ed, I'll let you\nget to it. I mean, I think you got some\nriding to do today. It looks beautiful.\nIt's beautiful here. Holy cow, we\nfinally have spring in in Michigan now.\nSo, you're right. Yeah. Uh and just\nYeah. I I feel like your move from Moran\nwhere you're kind of isolated\nto Traverse City. I see that you're\nriding with people and you're getting\nsome uh some consistent riding. Maybe\nnot as like putting in some like huge\ndistance or time like you were last\nyear, but uh from from the outside\nlooking in, I feel like the move has\nbeen a positive one for you. Yeah, for\nsure. I mean, it was it was a fun it was\na fun experience to live up there for 3\nyears and, you know, get really fast and\nlike borderline secret train unless you\nfollow me on Straa. And\nuh but yeah, the isolation up there.\nYeah, it gets to you. I mean, it's a\nit's a cool place, but it's it's also\nkind of sad living up there like\nsometimes, you know, it's a it's a Moran\nis a desolate spot.\nYeah. Well,\nfought for a gravel race. I'll say that.\nYeah. Yeah. Yeah. In a way that you were\njust that three years of Moran isolation\nwas just training you to become a better\nbike packer.\nIt was a three-year training camp\nbasically. Yeah. Yep. My my commute was\nlike a bike pack event. Like a winter\nultra. Yeah.\nYeah. Well, cool, man. Um, next time I'm\nup in TC, I'll I'll give you a shout.\nYeah, for sure. Well, maybe uh maybe\nyou'll take me on that uh some of your\nyour local rides now. Now that you're a\nlocal. Yeah. And uh we got we got uh\nChicken Leg 100 coming up in June. 100\nmiles of the best single track Northern\nMichigan has to offer. So, you know, my\nbrother sent me a link to this and I'm\nlike, first of all, where did he find\nit? He lives in San Diego. But uh two,\nlike is it on a Friday? It's on a\nFriday, man. Like what? Like we got to\nwork, man. Like what? Yeah. So my my\nboss is actually the guy putting it on.\nHe's the one who runs dirt church and uh\nso that's a paid day off from what I've\nheard. So it's it sounds like it's it's\na requirement that I have to be there.\nAnd I'm almost tempted to, this will\nsound crazy, but I'm I'm thinking about\nturning into Chicken Like 200 and riding\nto the start of it because why not, you\nknow? Seems like a good idea. So yeah,\nthat's that's coming up in June. So I\nmean, if you if you want to skip out of\nwork on a Friday and come up here and do\nChicken Leg 100, you know, it's it's\npretty cool. Sweet single track, man.\nThat's awesome. Good good good prep for\nyour I think you're doing Margie Out and\nback this year, aren't you? That's what\nI've heard. That's the plan. Yeah, that\nthe plan is to start it and we'll see\nsee what what goes. Yeah, exactly.\nYeah. Well, cool, Ed. Thanks. Thanks for\nuh the time and letting us know here. Uh\nlet us know more about uh about Doom. It\nwas great.

like 250\nbucks for a\nsingle-sided power meter yeah\ni've never had one on like\ni only have it on my road bike but yeah\nonly on a trainer\nyeah i like it a lot just so i can see\ni get a lot of my really good data out\nof outside riding i don't do a lot\ntraining outside but yeah\nvery useful isn't it\njust say zero watts or as hard as you\ncan exactly it's either\nor 800\nyou know\nit takes a long time to build like the\nmuscle\nlike the muscle memory to know what like\na certain torque feels like yeah i'm\nstill really bad at it\nand then like drama and estimate oh yeah\noh sometimes you'll see like 68 blocks\n68 come on\ni feel like straw is always like either\nit's like you are literally a grandma or\nit's like your god yeah well i mean if i\ngo mountain biking it says my average\nwill be like 2 8\nyou know yeah\nno you're good\nso we're skipping most of the uh\nthe hard\nstuff i haven't done this around a long\ntime but there's a 13 mile loop right\nhere\nstraight ahead are going\nthis is very heavy oh yeah\nmy favorite gravel climbs wow\nwho we're gonna end on it's going to\nblow your mind\nit gets to 16.\ni don't know of another hill\nanywhere\nnearby that's as bad as this one\nlast summer\nnow i can barely make it once\nlast summer i was doing hill reviews on\nit\ndoing it like 15 times\noh yeah and i say hi have you ridden\noutside with scotty

over\ni will say they have more gears\ndo you have a 46 on the back 44 yeah\nit's the biggest swamp offers without\ngoing full mullet\nand drink this water not a bad idea\nit's been good very busy\nbut in kind of a lot of good ways\ni got promoted at work\nso not just like\ndoing more but like i managed someone\nnow which has been a really fun\nexperience oh yeah\ndo a different work which i like more\njust bought a house with a girlfriend no\nway\nthat's amazing\njust an investment property like\neither one of us plans to be here like\nsuper long term\nyeah but\nfigure we can fix it up and sell it when\nwe leave kind of thing\nbut the neighborhood is insane\nyeah so\nit's like two blocks south of bhs\ntucked in a little neighborhood\nso like you'll be at the home office in\nfour minutes\nsam's club home office in like three\noh yeah the home was built in the 90s\nand like it was never remodeled\nso it's like a slam dunk easy renault\ntoo yeah\nwe're gonna fix it up probably over the\nnext five six months i think\nshe'll live there\nwe're not moving in together yet gonna\nkeep that from happening\ni've met her once haven't i yeah he did\nwhere was that\nsomething for scotty and ernie i\ncouldn't tell you what though oh\nmaybe\noh\nthat was nice good save\nthey look like they want you\ni'll say that\nlooking like a good snack over there\nand i'm sure\nhave you met ben dill yet\ni have once okay went out right with him\nso i didn't really meet him but i saw\nhim\nhe rides for a road for\nnovo it's at one point\nyep\nand i was\nessentially like\nkind of keeping up on him\nand leaving him on some hills\ni was like yeah\ni'm strong with him like three weeks\nlater he's like literally not crying\nhe's back at it\nanyway\nso volunteer workout regimens he sent\nover\nyeah we talked about that for a little\nbit i remember on the ride yeah\nstraight scopes not cycling\ni mean coach coach is a few cyclists\nthough\nleft here\ni was thinking about going straight\nwhile you\nbring the left\nit's not too dusty today\ni used to work on that brand a long time\nago\nno transitions company\nthe lens brand yeah\nbut they own everything they don't know\nglee all that stuff okay\nexotic is actually a kind of horrifying\ncompany\nso exotica have like an 87 market share\nof the world's\nframes yeah\nand then\npeso which is the company that i work\nfor who loves transitions\nnot like a 98 market share of\nthe lenses in the world\nso you can find the two and they have\nlike uh\nover 90 of all glasses in the world of\ntheirs yeah\nbut i just remember like i've tried on\nso many pairs of transition classes\nand they've just never worked well\nenough to be useful yet\nand they've gotten a ton better which is\nthe crazy part but they're still uh i've\nhad them before and i got these ones to\nget a really good deal on them\nthey work so much better\nthan the old ones yeah for sure\nall right\num\nyeah from afar they look sick but\nthere's no there's no glasses inside of\nglasses yeah you see that you're like oh\nuh scotty's video on oh yeah plenty of\ngood times see where the drone shots\ncame from\noh yep let's go\nwhat's up buddy\nhe was threatening i know i think he\nkind of wanted us he wanted a piece of\nthat action i think\ni probably have the heart rate bottom to\nrecently it's real easy\ni just can't do it in the heat\ni can tell when i'm at when it's not hot\nin the heat i run about 20 tires\nyeah yeah cluster right here left right\ni see\nthat's why i want you to trust me\nso how's your uh\nyour business going\nit's been all right yeah it had a pretty\nlike disappointing stretch of like\ni think i did like 25 pitches\nand it was 25 knows yeah one of those\nseasons i'm sure you know the feeling\nthere you go\nso we uh\nafter that i took a lot of i'm still in\nlike they all know i'm doing a\nthree-month break\njust to like\nget things back underneath me\nmore\ni'm ready to move on man\ni wanna\ni don't know well\nmy health app\ni remember\nthat i was working on my wearable app oh\nyeah did y'all pause that well yeah\nwhat's happening\ni uh\ni just want to work on that\ntoo much\nlevel is less video and more management\nthan anything else exactly\nand you don't make much more money\nwhen you do all that no just a lot more\nstress and more people's paychecks to\npay\nright now you know i can see a job with\nthree people\nthat is also\noh you weren't getting a big ass help\nuh\nhis last name starts with a team yeah\nkelly yep\nfirst time\ni love\nthat missing my old 42 on these though\nthis is a 34.\ni got you up but\nall right so check it out\nsit up pull your hands back\non the bars\ni'm about to fall over if i let go\nmove to the front of your seat\njust zip as much as possible\njust breathe\ngot it\noh there's quite the climb\nfeel good\ni mean\nwe survived that's what matters right\nso that's the thing that\nwas our gravel\nit's really hard to do like a zone 2\nride\nbecause like you have to get up those\nthings\nor just be like uber intentional with\nyour route design\neven then it's by still not possible\nthis guy ernie will actually hit like\none picture that's it\ni just hit 190 so\nyou gotta ride with him\nstretch\njust like smashing it yeah\nhe just watches with watts\nernie rolls 150 all the time\nthat's it\nuphill downhill\nbut you're like oh that sounds easy\nlike an exercise in like perfection i\ndon't think i could ever do but\nbig big long downhill here okay\nwe're gonna roll here for a mile\nheartland\nhappy\nout here\nhe will actually do it\nwe always\nmy last a race of the year\ni'll be out there\nit's kind of what this whole bike was\nbuilt for\nyeah those 650\nsaying a bees\non that chord\nbut tell you why everybody said it's so\nrough\nit ain't near dropping this right now\nthis isn't this is it i've written most\nof the course at this point in segments\nthis is infinitely worse than anything\nyou see a big trigger buy a long shot oh\ni go up north of basement on my holy\n[&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\nthis is like highways you know\nwhat i discovered when i first when i\ndid a couple pre-rides i was like\nman like\nobviously you got to be fit for the\nflats but\nso much of big sugar is just rolling\nhills\ni was like i would rather have a slow\nrolling tire\nbut be very confident in all of the sets\nexactly\nthen be like oh i saved who walks like\nthat that's not going to matter if i'm\nlike feathering the brakes the entire\nrace right\nlast year the way i wrote it\ndecided to ride with christian\nand then i could literally not ride that\nslow\nthey're just killing me\nit's like for the first three hours i\nwas\ni mean i was stopping at the\nrest for like 45 minutes yeah\nbut\nlet's go see like what we can do\nwe were after like 10\nand then on the whole day we actually\nlike 14 1. yep\nwe smashed us in there going like 17 the\nrest of the day home yeah the big thing\nwas just we just\ndo not touch the brakes in the hills\njust absolutely expensive yeah well like\ni'm like none of them are that sketchy\nthat you have to pull the brakes\nyeah there's one\nthat people walk down\nand i was like oh this is gonna be fun\nyou know like\ni went in between everybody just\nit's blue\nand how i tell after doing it like how\nthat's like one of the few parts i\nhaven't written yet how sketchy is that\nto say\noh i wouldn't say it's getting at all i\nmean it's just scary for like people who\nhaven't raced before i held the back\nbrakes but\nyou didn't like uh\nbecause you have to maintain control\nand honestly you're pretty much done\nwe just did i think it's like for the\nhardest\n10 miles\ni don't know any other place that has\nthat many punchers back to that track\nhey buddy\nwe're going too slow to present the\nchase yeah it's actually a benefit\nsometimes exactly\nthose dogs if they stop\nthey're fine\nthat's awesome\nyeah if they actually are a dog\ni'm sorry\ni'm dying\nleft\nthe next week i'm uh\nme and chris they're going to spain oh\napart\nrent\nbikes ride around spain that sounds\nincredible\nwe\nnever took a honeymoon\nyou went with 18 months and we got\nmarried yeah it wasn't really possible\nand\nwe don't know how long\nyou know we\nwe're not gonna leave\nheading anywhere specific or just riding\naround\nyou're running the whole time\nwell every day we're gonna ride\nwell i say every day\nwe'll probably do two group rides yeah\nbecause they have\nall their coffee shops owned by\nprofessional cyclists\nthat make sense let's see when they\nretire yeah\nand they have huge group rides take off\nout of there\nmike's only like 30 bucks a day what\nfor like road bikes like yeah 10 pound\ndog road bikes\nall the i2 i guess you're just riding\nsome pro's old collection probably yeah\nso we'll go up to the mountains a little\nbit probably\na lot of them are like 60k\nyou know that's nothing too crazy yeah\ndefinitely a big ride\ni'm actually going to rent a scooter\nand then we'll ride over to the coast\nbravo\nwhich is that\nthat's all the beaches on that coast\nit's about 30 minute drive\nit's a really smart idea when i went to\nspain nate and i rented\nscooters\nit's one of the best ways to get around\nbut cheap oh yeah they're insanely cheap\nthe whole trip i mean it's gonna cost us\nmaybe four grand\noh yeah for everything you can think of\nand supply miles\nthe flight scene cost us very much\ni'm excited\nnever been on a trip together\nreally no never that's so cool\nwell not going on a trip is not cool but\nlike going on a trip together for the\nfirst time in school yeah\nwe've gone\nwell we went to cypress one time which\nis in the mediterranean but that was\nwith her family\nmy sister came\nnever been just us\nwe're ready\nnot to mention it's like spanish culture\njust like those they're very it's just\nso relaxed\nnothing is important in that country\nwell and like i'm so specific on my diet\nlike i'll eat meat and stuff i'm mostly\nplant-based but\ni've been eating meat in dallas like\nthis is a fun place to eat\ni love good food\nbut i need like kind of more whole foods\nfor sure the main is so much fresh\nseafood you know oh yeah it's\nsolid\nyeah i'm really excited\nhey he feels really good right now\nbecause he's not in treatment you know\nsure yeah\nthere's kind of no risk right now for\nafter he goes to chemo we'll be like\nkobe style oh yeah because it means it's\nan oppression yeah\nwhen do you leave for that trip\nit's actually on the\ncrossing the highway or going left\nacross the highway\nwe're gonna do one loop\nwe'll come back down that side\nprobably do a road\nthat you've done before\nthe old highway\nyeah yeah popping the road bike route\nhow you feeling\njust fine\nit is 419.\nnever a good time\noh big old gap there we go\nhow many races to go this year\nuh by the end of the year yeah 20.\ni did my 15th\ntwo weeks ago so\nyou guys are just big gravel races okay\nwell i've got two more cribs three\nyeah i've been loving crit racing\ni think it's crazy fun\ni've always done it one time\ni just bring that last two one time\ni filmed that rant last year\nyeah i just love\nlike there's so much to learn\nwhat's crazy to me is that like i did my\nfirst i have footage of all of it\nmy first crit i did\ni was like terrified of doing a four\ncorner crit\ni'm like 20 mile an hour to turn yeah\nand like\nmy last natural state crit we're doing\nlike 33\ninto the final corner and i was like i\nprobably could have done that\ndidn't know that faster that was really\nbad\njust crazy how much like your\nperspective shifts\nyeah i did not\nerase it well at all all right\nthe guy who won\na buddy of mine\nnear the race\ni had a power meter off of that\nhe had the exact same power yep\nhe won\ni was in the second pack\nthat's how crew racing goes right now\nfor\ni had sure kind of go down in front of\nme\nspook you well\nwhat actually happened\nis i was\nreally working with the kids a lot then\nyep i said i'll pull you guys\nyep let's try and catch him\nwe never caught him but\ni pulled like hell for a lot of it\nsomebody's got to do it\ni was so bad for those kiddos\nbecause like they'll weigh like 50 60\ntimes less than a lot of those guys\nand just like the wattage required for\nthem to actually break something no i'm\nlike it's not like it's not there\nall right right claire\nwe'll see if we can get through\nis it questionable sometimes\nyeah i see\nwhat\noh i see a cece\nlast time i got a ride from the truck\nnever a bad time\nwe're on the easier side now all the\nroads get easier over here\nit's not quite a drought just a little\nyeah a little less chunky\ni mean if we kept going we'd be on\nprobably some\nall right i will watch and observe\nlet's see\nno\nthat was incredible\ni got that all on camera too oh that's\nbeautiful\n[Laughter]\nwhen i saw your wheel just like lurch\ninto the ground i was like oh he's going\nover the handlebars\noh my god\noh bro that's incredible\ni've never done that that's first right\nthere baby launching yourself over the\nbike i mean i've done it on a mountain\nbike a hundred times sure\nnever on the gravel bike\nwell i say that\ni guess the tire wrecked with ogc that\nnight\noh man\nit's not your little chilly my phone\nworks there we go\ni never keep my phone there\nuh of course the one time you do we had\nan extra one i was like i'll throw it on\nwhatever it's easy to pull off take\nphotos or something\nthe shapes looks damn good\nhow you feel great\nwell i'm just gonna freak you want to\nwalk through you want to go back\nhow good is the rest of this loop you\ntell me\nthe problem is there's not a whole lot\nthis one section is great\nno [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] i'm not sure\ni don't think so but we'll see\ni don't know how i'm feeling\nregret this\nentire really good time"

      "transcript": "I don't really know. I don't I don't\nknow how Bishop roped me into this.\nLooking at it from the outside, I've\nnever thought of it as a good idea until\nnow. I actually don't think it's a good\nidea still.\n&gt;&gt; [music]\n[music]\n&gt;&gt; What did we just do? Um, we just rode\n300 mi in\nabout 30 hours, which doesn't sound like\nmuch, but it's not terribly fast out\nthere. [music]\n&gt;&gt; This is where it becomes reality TV. You\nknow what I mean? Malachi off the\nisland.\nI'm Jeremiah Bishop. [music] We are here\nin Fyville, Arkansas. We got the invite\nto come out here and take on a newly\ninvented bike packing route called the\nOzark's Megaloop.\n&gt;&gt; Excuse me, sir. Are you Jeremiah Bishop?\n&gt;&gt; Uh, yes.\n&gt;&gt; I have an envelope for you.\n&gt;&gt; From Doom with love. Welcome to\nFagetville. You're cordially invited to\na game of hideand seek.\n&gt;&gt; Your mission, [music] should you not\nchicken out, is to ride the Ozark Mega\nLoop\n&gt;&gt; and find five of the seven hidden single\n[music] track checkpoints. In less than\n40 hours,\n&gt;&gt; the obvious is your undoing. Sincerely\nwith [music] a kiss, Dr. Doom.\n&gt;&gt; There's this legendary gravel race\ncalled Doom. And the creator of Doom,\nAndrew, said, \"Would you accept the\nspecial challenge?\" It was at that\nmoment we knew we'd be in big trouble.\nWell, Doom's task [music] for us was to\nhit five of seven hidden checkpoints\nlocated in the various trail centers\nthat dotted the route. Each checkpoint\nhas these [music] gremlin bells that are\nhidden somewhere deep in the forest and\nwe have to go retrieve them. Coming up\nwith less than five checkpoints in the\n40hour time limit means we failed the\nchallenge and the route is considered\nimpossible.\nOf course, this had the gears turning in\nour head, and we were trying to\nstrategize which checkpoints we might\nhit or skip, but the game had been set,\nand we only had a [music] few hours to\nsleep, and we would just have to figure\nit out on the fly. Oh, and Andrew said\nwe had to bring a rookie.\n&gt;&gt; Look what the cat is.\n&gt;&gt; So, I called up the only local guy I\nknow that seemed to have some endurance\nchops. Malachi Cadwell. I knew he had\nsome skills, but I didn't know if he had\nthe endurance. But I had no clue how\nhard this would be and I'm sure he\ndidn't either.\n&gt;&gt; What's up?\n&gt;&gt; How's it going? How's it going?\n&gt;&gt; Good to see you. Good to see you.\n&gt;&gt; Good to see you. Hugs all around. Hugs\nall around.\n&gt;&gt; The route, the Ozark's mega route plus\nthese checkpoints, even if we only hit\nfive of the seven is over 300 m with\nclose to 30,000 vertical feet of\nclimbing. very chunky jeep trail. A lot\nof loose rocks, steep, barely ridable\nclimbs, sections you have to push. But\nthen the checkpoints looks like it's in\na state park. We could be like hiking\nupstairs, riding technical downhills.\nDoesn't it look like a real trail? What\nis that? How is it? Leave bike [music]\nat trail head. Oh, he said you've been\nrunning a lot lately, right?\n&gt;&gt; I don't run, man.\n&gt;&gt; We're hanging out in Fville. The Ozark's\nbike packing route network starts in\nFavville. This [music] eclectic college\ntown is vibrant and bustling. There's\ngreat restaurants and a cozy downtown,\nmaking it a really nice base to kick off\nour adventure. This is part of the old\nArkansas. You know, the one made up of\nthe workingass folks, farms, local\nartists, and there's even a ball museum.\nSo, welcome to the ball ball museum. Zim\nZam Zim Zam. These are mostly gifts.\nMost interesting ball strange like a a\nhair ball from the stomach of a cow.\nI kid you not. If we're really\ndesperate, we lick on that. A lady in in\nin Bville brushes her two cats [music]\nevery day. And after about 5 years, she\nhad this.\n&gt;&gt; I can get I can get my van.\n&gt;&gt; Okay. So, this is a replica of a Bucky\nBall. 60 carbon atoms. And this little\nvial has a billion times a billion\nperfect spheres. Like,\n&gt;&gt; you kind of go on a ride with someone,\nyou don't really know what they're going\nto [music] be like.\n&gt;&gt; The big unknown here is is kind of like\nour mesh of people. I don't know\nMalachi. I've talked to Bishop for\nprobably like 45 minutes of my life.\n[music] We don't have one joker card. We\ngot like three jokers and then there's\nlike this Doom thing happening on the\nside. Dr. [music] Doom or whatever his\nname is.\n[laughter]\n&gt;&gt; I haven't met Dr. Doom, but I think he's\na psychopath.\n&gt;&gt; The Scrabble stuff is kind of just like\nlong and really hard all the time.\nEmotions run high. Tempers flare.\nThere's snakes apparently. [music] It\nsounds like like we're just looking for\nlike a little piece of metal in the\nforest basically. This is actually going\nto be really hard. Like that's pretty\nfar. And we all have like really\ndifferent setups, which is funny. The\nbike that I have is a Sage uh Storm\nKing, which is a adventure gravel bike,\nwhich fits large tires. I've got some\n1.9 tires.\nThe bike I brought is it's Canidel\nTopstone. Got kind of a little [music]\nkingpin pivot thing in the back. Got a\nlittle shock on the front. Lefty. keep\nthings weird. Um, I have these bars on\nthat I put on for um, Transcordier.\nThey're like these flat bars with road\nlevers. [music] I didn't bring the best\nlights, so hopefully I can kind of mooch\na little. So, coming into the route, I\nknew it was going to be really rocky and\nrough, and I needed some extra tire\nclearance. Luckily, I was given the\nopportunity from Fat Tire Bike Shop to\nborrow a Trek checkpoint, and I put my\nIndustry 9 Solex wheels with some really\nchunky boy tires.\nYou ever slipped in a shammy?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I have. It's real frame.\nFlawless.\n&gt;&gt; It's all black diamonds.\nThat's the nice separate things.\n&gt;&gt; I'm Ryan West, owner, operator of Oz\nCycling Tours. We offer gravel greenway\nand mountain bike tours based out of\nBendville, Arkansas. We try to customize\nto our clients needs and we'll build\ntheir dream tour from there. Our role is\nnot really to support the riders because\nthis is impossible route since a\nself-ported ride. We are here to help\nthe videographer team and to help\norganize some things in the beginning.\nThe Ozarks are a place of of hiddenness.\nThe landscape just kind [music] of\nembraces you here. They're a place where\npeople have been very creative and have\nmade do with very limited means. They're\na place that until very recently has\nbeen very isolated. When I grew up here,\nthere wasn't an interstate or really a\nproper airport. Because of that, you\nknow, some of these unique and quirky\ncharacteristics of Fagatville have\nreally flourished.\n&gt;&gt; The backwoods of Ozarks, they're kind of\nlegend hillbilly. Kind of like you're\nnot sure what you're going to run into\nlike character-wise of any of the people\nrunning around.\nThese things, they have a way of being\nvery different than you expect them\n[music] to go. The heat is X factor.\nIt's supposed to be nearly 90 with the\nheat index. You don't know where water\nis going to be. You don't know if you're\ngoing to find food. We're going into\nseveral areas that are like the Bermuda\nTriangle of the Ozarks.\nThe route is going to be\nis going to be peral. They will get the\nthe full taste of the Ozarks. It's going\nto be two epic days of hard [music]\nriding for sure.\n&gt;&gt; On the brief, it said 4:00 start.\nThought that meant that we were starting\nat like 400 p.m. Sleep in, you know,\nhave some brunch, experience Favville.\nAnd then, yeah, I talked to JB and he's\nlike, \"No, you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] idiot. Like, it's\n4:00 a.m. [laughter]\nIt's perfect.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n&gt;&gt; we didn't check tire.\n&gt;&gt; No, mine's like Mine's literally 15.\nProbably 16.\n&gt;&gt; It's perfect.\n&gt;&gt; This is so much to think about.\n&gt;&gt; You [music] just tried with a coffee cup\nmaking fun of me for being gel already.\non me.\n&gt;&gt; The first checkpoint that we had to hit\nwas right here [music] outside of town\nat Mount Kesler. And I wasn't sure if it\nwas a good idea to go for the first. You\nknow, maybe some of the others are\neasier to get to because it won't be\ndark.\nThe riding in the Ozarks is very gnarly.\nIt's [music] rugged and often feels like\nyou're in the middle of nowhere.\nAlex has done it all. I mean, the guy's\nraced to France five times. I mean, like\nnational road champion. I mean, he's\nlike Swiss watch when it comes to like\nlocking down the arrow position, just\nchurning out watts.\nKind of hard to read, you know? He'll\nsay like some really kind of backhanded\njokes. He He's not a man of many words,\nbut he has some very substantial things\nto say.\n&gt;&gt; In the middle of the shootout and I\nthought a four loco was an energy drink,\nwhich it is, but it's also got like four\nshots of duda in there, if you know what\nI mean.\n&gt;&gt; JB is absolutely stubborn. He is a\nstubborn old bastard. There is a lot of\ndifference between our personalities. I\nthink Alex is [music] a very chill and\nhumble person and so he doesn't tend to\nshow his emotions as [music] much. You\nknow, I'm a very outright person.\nThe longest bike ride I've ever done is\n250 mi, but I'm not very experienced. I\nwas really intimidated. [music] I\ndefinitely feel like I'm a little bit\nout of my league. These dudes are super\nexperienced. I know that the terrain out\nhere is pretty rugged [music] and\nthere's honestly not very much out there\nas far as rest stops [music] that you\ncan get. And we got to the real roller\ncoaster that makes up mile 50 to 70.\n[music] Got harder, hillier. The fatigue\nstarted to set in. And then we started\nto head towards Devil's Den.\nYeah, some of those trails would\ndefinitely be more fun on the mountain\nbike. So, we were riding pretty scared\non some of these giant rock slabs and\nunderneath overhangs and,\n&gt;&gt; you know, there's sharp rocks\neverywhere. I'm thinking just don't\nflat.\n&gt;&gt; Uh, but we made it to the checkpoint. It\nwas underneath this incredible\ncliff [music] with a waterfall dripping\ndown.\n&gt;&gt; Got the Canadian bell on the ledge. You\nknow, Malachi, he's still a kid on the\nbike. You know, he's [music] he's in\ncollege. He's stoked on the single\ntrack. I mean, the kid [music] can ride\nthe hell out of the bike. He's a good\nrider. He definitely has zero road\nexperience. So, like when we're trying\nto do a pace line on the road, I'm like,\n\"Get on the wheel. You know, you got to\nride this way.\" And [music] okay, he he\ndoesn't know how to do that.\nSo, when we were about mile 90 or so\nnear Mountainberg, you know, we hit this\nreally funky cafe that had [music] like\na bus and like alien sculpture out\nfront. We refueled, got some salty\nfries.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, we're pretty hungry.\n&gt;&gt; So, I got a salad.\n&gt;&gt; Oh,\nI'm in a dark spot. I'm really happy\nthat we made it here for food right now.\nSo, I don't feel cracked, but I'm tired\nright now. Definitely tired.\n&gt;&gt; Wouldn't think about it too much. Just\nkind of look at the hill in front of\nyou.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; At the beginning on [music] the road\nportions, they kind of started moving\nand we had a pace line going in like the\nfirst hour [music] after the single\ntrack and I was absolutely pinned. My\nheart rate was like 170. [music]\n&gt;&gt; I could tell Malachi didn't didn't\nreally look right. But he said his heart\nrate was [music] just cranked, you know.\nHe said it was like 15 20 beats per\nminute higher than normal.\nMy leg started cramping around mile 100.\nAnd around mile 130, it really hit me on\na big climb that we hit. My leg just\nlocked a little bit.\n&gt;&gt; And we've been riding for about 11\nhours.\n&gt;&gt; I'm battling a little bit of crampage.\nRight. Right up in this muscle right\nhere.\n&gt;&gt; Well, son, rub some dirt on it. Take a\nsalt tablet.\n&gt;&gt; Apparently,\n&gt;&gt; this is where it becomes reality TV. You\nknow what I mean?\n&gt;&gt; Mal car. But off the island,\n&gt;&gt; the big thing I've learned on these\ncrazy adventures is you have to just\ncompartmentalize, worry about where you\nare. And so, you got to really just\ndispel those negative thoughts. Back on\nthe bikes, rolling down this huge\ndescent, and then we pass this ice cold\nblue lake.\nThank you, Paul.\nIt's 4:16. So, we started this thing 11\nand 1/2 hours to go. We're 120 mi in.\nAnd Alex just said we only have 65 miles\nto get to the ranch. Wee\nbetter.\nYou know, there's a viable like plan B\nand that would be just to like go\nstraight to Horseshoe\nCanyon Ranch, rest up and then get all\nthree tomorrow. Oh, ceiling. Oh, guys.\n&gt;&gt; Let's just going to run away too.\n&gt;&gt; Just run it.\n&gt;&gt; Just like cheating.\n&gt;&gt; Cheating.\n&gt;&gt; This is called planning, my man.\nWow.\n&gt;&gt; Jeremiah was talking and he was saying\nthat around hour 5 to 8 he was having\nsome really bad [music] knee pain. He he\nwas saying he was having some bone on\nbone action happening and I was just\n[music] like what? This dude is crazy.\nHe just kept pushing like it was\nnobody's business. He popped a Tylenol\nand just kept going. Our biggest issue\nwould have just been navigation. [music]\nWe're running our GPS's on low power\nmode and oh, we missed the turn. We got\nto turn around real quick. On the single\ntrack sections, his Wahoo died at some\npoint. So, I was responsible [music] for\nthe navigation. Every time I'd be like,\nI swear it's this way. I swear it's this\nway. And he would be riding the opposite\ndirection.\n&gt;&gt; I think it's over there to the right,\nbut you don't see a single track at all.\nperson you're trying to reach is not\navailable. At the tone, please record\nyour message. When you have finished\nrecording, you may hang up.\n&gt;&gt; Alex,\nthere you are. I was really worried cuz\nI didn't see any tracks, too.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, man. But it's getting interesting\nout here.\n&gt;&gt; The impossible route. Everybody thinks\nof it as an impossible route, but\n[music] it's about four times as hard\nwhen you're trying to film the whole\nthing yourself. You just kept doubling\nback and Oh, this got good light. Turn\naround. Turn around. Oh, this Oh. Oh.\nOh, this climb looks sick. Yeah. Turn\naround. Turn around.\nSome cold pizzas would be about\n&gt;&gt; not even possible.\n&gt;&gt; Not even possible.\n&gt;&gt; It was at this moment that he knew he\n[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up.\n&gt;&gt; Plan is no plan. We have no resources at\nour disposal. I have two uh two or three\nof [snorts] these Scandinavian fish.\nWhen you [music] haven't had anything to\neat in 3 hours and you're stuck in the\nsticks and trying to find some stupid\n[music] bell hung on a tree in the\nmiddle of nowhere, you might forget to\npick up sandwiches before the store\ncloses.\n&gt;&gt; I don't think there's anything quite\nlike riding [music] your gravel bike\ndown rocky mountain terrain at night.\n&gt;&gt; Riding at night is like riding through a\ntunnel. You have no peripheral vision,\nyou know. It It also takes more\nconcentration, I think.\nand everything just seems to like\nfunnel down this kaleidoscope of stuff\ncoming at you. And at some point it can\nbe a little freaky. You know, you hear\nsomething in the woods and you you turn\nand you know, you're not sure where the\nsound came from. Barks was alive [music]\nand it was neat to stop and just look\naround and look up and see the vastness\nof the canopy. And I mean, we were deep\nin there. I mean, we're in the jungle\nand Malachi fell over, you know, bent\nhis rear derailer hanger. You know, we\npause halfway down cuz we're going to\nlook at the map. Look at this dude. He's\ncool.\n&gt;&gt; And then I hear something in the bushes\nright next to you. Like rattlesnake is\nin the bushes right next to my leg.\n&gt;&gt; Rattlesnake.\n&gt;&gt; Holy.\n&gt;&gt; We're seeing all the nature.\n&gt;&gt; Well, I'm not going to get too close.\nCan you see him? I'm\n&gt;&gt; not really afraid of snakes, but some of\nthem have fangs, you know.\n&gt;&gt; Dinner time.\n&gt;&gt; Young blood. I got a tree for Jeremiah.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; This checkpoint might be a bust. We're\nclose. Wow. You're going to eat that\nthing?\n&gt;&gt; I don't know. I could try. All right,\nlet's look at the\n&gt;&gt; Oh, you found it. Look what we found.\nWe we almost like gave up on it, but\n&gt;&gt; all right, let's keep going. Let's keep\ngoing.\n&gt;&gt; It's like, dude, we're we're nowhere.\nLike, we have no service for anything.\n[music] It's like pitch black. His\nMalachi would just like send it on these\ndownhills. JB has like, you know, he\nkind of gets the dad vibe going. He's\nlike, \"Malai, Maly, slow down.\" Uh,\n[music] yeah. I like took off on this\nhill. I got out of sight and I turned my\nlights off. So they were chasing a\nghost, you know, and I popped out from\nbehind the bushes and gave him the rebel\nyell, you know. [laughter]\nI do think when I scared JB, I think he\npooped his pants. Finally made it to\nHorseshoe Canyon and the thought of like\nwaking up and riding again in 4 hours\nwas terrible.\n&gt;&gt; Was\nrather [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up.\n&gt;&gt; I am emotionless right now.\n&gt;&gt; Rolling in a horseshoe was definitely\nthe darkest point. I didn't think that I\nwas gonna make it honestly.\n&gt;&gt; My real legs.\n&gt;&gt; You were out all day, out for dinner,\nout for chocolate.\nUh, slept pretty good.\n&gt;&gt; The cabins at Horseshoe Canyon were\nnice, but our plan was to ride the loop\nin Horseshoe Canyon, hit the checkpoint,\nand then ride to breakfast.\nOkay,\nwe made a wrong turn, guys. We're in the\nMiddle East.\nSo, we rode east. Beautiful morning\nlight, descended into Jasper, and we\nrode just a little bit off course and\nstopped at the Ozark Cafe.\nThe food there was amazing. I'm talking\nbacon, French toast, pancakes,\nomelets,\nbiscuits. This is not a work set at all.\n&gt;&gt; This butt feels horrible. [music] It's\nlike I try to shift from one cheek to\nthe other and it doesn't help. Did you\nuse the shaving cream? No. I'm getting\nI'm eating as much as I can. I feel like\n&gt;&gt; last night I got it and I just wanted to\njust rub off.\n&gt;&gt; Drugs, man. No more than one tablet.\nOne is for a normal person. This is a\nnormal. I need two. Yeah. I mean, would\nyou ride 300 miles?\n&gt;&gt; I dare I I'd ride 300 miles. You either\ngoing up or you're going down. There's\nvery little that's flat. Uh originally\nfrom South Africa, so Jasper was\nperfect. It was like moving 100 years\nago. But this community is very [music]\naccepting and very welcoming. People are\nnot judged on the color of their skin.\npeople are over time will be judged on\nthe content of their character\n&gt;&gt; and in the small community like this if\num you are upright you're going to just\nbe wonderfully [music] received\n&gt;&gt; in my humble opinion the Buffalo River\nis the most beautiful place in the whole\nworld it's ancient [music]\nstill pristine and and it's the way it\nwas for millions of years and you just\ncan't find that very many places\nanymore. I just love the flora and fauna\nof the Ozarks. I've lived everywhere,\nbut this feels like so special.\n&gt;&gt; Man, Malachi is just the little [music]\nengine that could, you know what I mean?\nJeremiah and I have been doing this bike\nthing for a long time. Um, I mean,\nhonestly, both of us been at it longer\n[music] than he's been alive. just kept\non trucking and sucking down the fuel\nand had a smile on his face pretty much\nthe whole time\nand we pulled back a little bit of time.\nWe were feeling good about ourselves.\nWe're kind of like right at the point of\nwhich we think we're going to make it by\ndark. But then I I realized only one\n[music] of the two checkpoints in\nFagville count. So if we don't hit the\nPanka checkpoint, then we technically\ndidn't make the challenge. We didn't\nfinish.\nOh, god damn it. You know, we got to\ndescend 1,400\nft down into this canyon and get to the\nvery bottom and then we're going to have\nto climb all the way back up this\nmonster thing on who knows what type of\nhike of bike hell it's going to be.\nBy the time we got back up to the top of\nthe canyon, I mean, this section of\ntrail probably we average 8 mph\npin chain, you know,\n&gt;&gt; the impossible walk.\n&gt;&gt; 75 mi to go.\n&gt;&gt; Oh jeez.\n&gt;&gt; 6 hours left.\n&gt;&gt; Double our pace.\n&gt;&gt; We were back in the red. [music] But\nthere was only one choice and that was\nthe hammer.\n&gt;&gt; I see some buddy.\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna help you.\n&gt;&gt; Flying down these dirt roads, we had a\nfortunate stretch of pavement that\nreally got us back up to speed. So, we\nlooked like we were going to get there\nabout half an hour before dark. But the\nwhole last 60 miles, my right knee felt\nlike bone on bone. And to add on top of\nthat, my left shoe, it cracked in half.\nBlast down the road down into Bay Fill\nor climbing up this climb. I fall over,\nland on Alex,\ncrash on the uphill.\nMan,\nMalachi is like he horse smells the\nbarn. You know, when horse smells the\nbarn, he gets a huge second wind, you\nknow, but we have just, you know, five\nor six minutes to get to the top. It's\nstarting to get dark in the forest and\nwe finally, you know, crest the top of\nthis thing. It's a beautiful sunset.\nHigh fives all around. We hit the final\ncheckpoint.\n&gt;&gt; We got it. We got it. We got it. We got\n15 minutes. All right,\n&gt;&gt; checkpoint.\n&gt;&gt; We blast down the road down into Fville.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, it's\n&gt;&gt; awesome.\n&gt;&gt; Good job.\n&gt;&gt; Mental battle.\n&gt;&gt; It was a mental battle, that's for sure.\n&gt;&gt; What a day.\n&gt;&gt; You had a lot of fun.\nWell, that's the type of uh type two fun\nthat\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, type two.\n&gt;&gt; I always question I swear after every\none of these last one.\n&gt;&gt; It goes up and down. You know, there's\nminutes there where you think there's no\npossible way we're going to get\nanywhere. Like, we got to go home right\nnow. Jeremiah knows how to\n&gt;&gt; squeeze every last drop out of somebody,\nif you know what I mean, in terms of\ngetting them to the finish line.\n&gt;&gt; I think that was definitely the hardest\nthing I've ever done in my life. So when\nyou do hard things, hard things [music]\nbecome easy. When you step out and you\npush yourself and you get to that point\nof like you don't think you're going to\nmake it, bottom of ponka. But these\nthings and getting through them and\nbreaking through those mental barriers,\nthose are tools for life. And [music]\nthat mental toolbox, you know, that'll\nserve you the rest of your life.\nSuch\n&gt;&gt; the Ozarks Mega Loop is absolutely\nunderrated.\nFor the average person, I would [music]\nsay breaking this up into five different\ndays would be ultimately the the way to\ndo it. [music] For destination stop in\nJasper, you got your destination stop in\nHorseshoe. There's honestly many\nbeautiful places to camp on the route.\nSo, it would be enjoyable and a stellar\nexperience.\n&gt;&gt; But go prepared. Bring the inreach.\nBring the chain tools. If I would do it\nagain, I would I'd probably take some\nbug spray\nand uh maybe some shaving cream, maybe a\nlittle bit more bike. It's like just so\nvaried. Um a lot of hills, a lot of up\nand down. Batesville is cool because\nit's like a good combination of of real,\nright? They got the they got the\npoisonous snakes, but it's also a little\nbit La La Land, right? Like they got the\nthey got the gap jumps and they got the\npoisonous snake. Definitely a couple of\nthose single track sections where we\nwere trying to find our little bells. I\nwas like getting pretty quiet, you know?\nI was like, I'm not saying anything. I'm\njust going to be quiet and pissed off.\nAnd I was just thinking about how much\nof a dumpster fire he put together. If\nanybody is interested in [music] coming\nto town and visiting us, we can put this\ntrip together for you in like a 4-day\ntrip instead of a 2-day 48 hour just\npush. you know, we'll cater to your\ntrip, [music] have meals, cook for you,\nhaul your gear in the in the end into\nend of SAG vehicle. And if you just want\nto come to town and ride and check out\nBentonville, Fateville, or any of\nNorthwest Arkansas, we have plenty of\nguides and plenty of knowledge of the\nthe best riding around. And so, we would\nlove for you to come down and hang out\nwith us.\nTrips like this, I mean, it just\nreignites my passion for cycling. the\npain will go away and like the and\nwhat's left are awesome memories and new\nfriends because it's not just about the\nriding. [music] It's about combating the\nspace between here and here. That is the\nimpossible route.\n&gt;&gt; Old man Jeremiah still got it.\n&gt;&gt; It was this old man stuff.\n&gt;&gt; Middle.\n&gt;&gt; I am old, but you don't have to call it\nout.\n&gt;&gt; I'm over double my age.\n&gt;&gt; We're throwing out. I'm coming with a\nI'm coming with a white beard next time.\nI'm going full Gandalf when you're at\nme.\n&gt;&gt; And then I'm going to do a wheelie pass."

welcome back to bike\ntalk with Dave we'll we'll go back to\nthat but uh Brennan you are also on bike\ntalk with Dave I don't know if you\nremember after the World Cycle cars\nWorld Championships I grabbed you for I\ndon't know four and a half minutes for\nmy Oz cross recap as cross\nwas that Oz Cross or was it the World\nChampionships I'm gonna have to go back\nand listen it might have been Oz cross\nbut anyway uh had you on for a brief bid\non one of my experiential uh pods so\nwelcome back to the podcast bread and\npack how you doing today\nDave doing great glad to be here I did\nnot eat ice cream yet today so that you\nknow I'm I'm kind of bummed a little bit\nnow but\num doing all the bike month things uh\nliving the commuter lifestyle right now\nso uh gorgeous day here in Northwest\nArkansas and just stoked to be riding\nbikes today it's been a good day awesome\nuh so Andrew I want to go back to you\nbecause you are you are on to talk about\nthe Arkansas High Country race which\nstill blows my mind that we have a\nThousand Mile uh kind of a back country\nex back bike packing experience like\nwithin like in the center of the United\nStates which is super cool uh and I'll\nI'll put a link back to that I don't\nremember what episode that was but we\ntalked about Arkansas High Country and\nyou are also oh man I feel like you're\nmean is that can I say that yeah Doom\nyou were there you are the director of\nDoom yeah who does Doom where did that\nname come from Doom yeah it's so\nI mean basically I created this route in\nthe Ozarks that's just shy of 400 miles\nton of elevation gain and loss a lot of\nreally chunky roads after running the\nevent for two years it's been decided\nthat a mountain bike is the way to go\num but I just I didn't have any\nadjectives to describe it's hard to like\nyou can't say the the ramble or the The\nShowdown or the oh no there's a lot of\ndifferent terms out there and none of\nthem felt fitting I didn't want to\nsandbag it anyway so if you just throw\nsomething out there like Doom no one can\ndrop out or finish and say man you you\nreally made this sound easier than it\nwas you know it's I I respected it I 100\nrespect that because I named this\npodcast bike talk with Dave yeah like\nthat's what it is that's exactly there's\nno questions\nyeah I finished the route and it took me\nanother two or three weeks after\nfinishing the route to give it a name so\nit was done I had the file for it and I\njust was tossing literally tossing and\nturning at night like I just need a name\nso I can just people what it is and get\nit out there and that's awesome yeah\nthat happened earlier this spring and I\nwe're here to talk about something\nthat's happening this fall the Ozark\nrenderer did I say that right yeah right\nand it's like I've been cyclist my whole\nlife and I struggle with that right I do\nI do know how to say\ncampanolo and derailleur until I know\nsome stuff but we're going to talk about\nthe Ozark randineer here in a little bit\nBrennan I want to talk a little bit\nabout you're with experience\nFayetteville and you have the coolest\njob title of anyone in cycling I think\nthe hey let's get people to ride their\nbikes in Fayetteville director the\ndirector of of that\num I don't think that's officially on\nyour card but director of cycling\ntourism is that right that's right Dave\nthat's right that's a great job man\nit is uh it is I get to I get to work my\npassion and I truly am blessed I work\nfor experience Fayetteville it's the\ndestination marketing Organization for\nFayetteville Arkansas we're in the\nnorthwest corner of the state and yeah I\nget to spend my days hanging out with\ncool dudes like Andrew and scheming up\nuh what's missing in this case when we\ntook a look at the calendar which is\nreally rich boy is it we we call it we\ncall ourselves event Rich here in\nNorthwest Arkansas but when we look at\nthings and you know what do we have when\nwe talk things about the High Country\nwhich is you know this thousand Thirty\nmile amazing Backcountry experience and\nthen Andrew's Doom\num you know what are we missing in that\nand so I challenged and I know we'll get\ninto it but I challenge danger to like\nhey find us find us what's missing and\nhe brought this Randon ear concept to me\nand I was super stoked to get behind it\nand now we're talking bikes with Dave I\nlove it I love talking to event\npromoters who are putting on something\nunique different and I mean I guess as\nyou asked for Brennan the like fill the\ngap\nand I feel like that's what this Ozark\nrandoneer races can I say ray race event\nevent I would say event of a race it's\nuh the whole concept which we can dive\ninto it but it's more more around a ride\nan event a challenge over a race it's uh\nyeah for sure I would I would steer\ntowards event over over race 100 yeah so\nexplain that to me because I when I\nfirst saw it I was like oh Ryan and her\nlike\nI don't care about my time I don't care\nabout my place I don't care about\nanything but like making the distance\nand yet you do have a cut if you want to\nbe an official finisher you got to be\ndone in for the 120 mile or it's 15\nhours and there's a 200 mile and you've\ngot 25 hours which is kind of nice it's\nyou get you don't have to go 10 miles an\nhour you can go a little slower than\nthat but yep um so then that to me feels\nlike a race a little bit so explain to\nme a random\nDefine it and help me understand I'm\ngoing to start with I have it in both\nthe the bike reg and on the website\nitself it's just a quote from Yan of\nRenee Hurst you know he's he's very\ncultured and he's been he's been playing\nbikes for a super long time really cool\nguy I gotta hang out with him last\nOctober he came to Arkansas to do a 500\nMile route he did the the South Loop of\nthe adventure Cycling Association\nArkansas High Country and uh\nyeah basically what he what I took from\nan article he has with uh\nhis website is in a nutshell\na random ear is cycling with like-minded\nfriends on beautiful roads while\nchallenging herself to ride better than\nyou ever imagined how you define better\nin quotes is up to you better can mean\nfaster more miles more fun more dot dot\ndot or a combination of the above\nso I mean there's no doubt there will be\nsome people that are going to show up\nand they're gonna say I'm gonna ride\nfaster than everybody else and that's\ncool for them that's that's better than\nthey ever have before you know it's\nputting themselves out there can I just\nput my head down and cover these miles\nfaster than anybody else other people\nmay be hey I've literally never ridden\nthrough the night in my entire life and\nI convinced two of my dumb friends that\nI work with or hang out with during the\nweek uh to go try it with me and we're\nall gonna basically make sure that we\nstay awake we're gonna take some five\nhour energies we're gonna slap each\nother whatever it takes now and uh\nso I think it's really cool it doesn't\nhave to be oh I'm going to beat this\nperson or beat that person it's I have a\nchallenge set forth in front of me and\nit's covering this beautiful but\nchallenging terrain and I want to see if\nI can accomplish that challenge uh there\nare those time cutoffs I mean that goes\nback to the beginning of the sport in\nFrance and Italy it's uh\nthey've been doing this for a really\nlong time randoneering there's actually\nlike an official Association of\nrandoneering and there's these different\nevents across the country in other\ncountries where it's very very strict\nrules and this is a random basically\nit's a random a and if you complete it\nyou are a random and we didn't want to\ngo too over the top right out of the\ngate it's just like hey we made these\nroutes and this is the loose structure\nof it we're kind of celebrating a big\nride where you get out into the Ozarks\nand you come back you start and end in\nFayetteville and I mean that's\nessentially what it is it's just showing\nmore of what Arkansas has to offer away\nfrom the main cities and I think\nFayetteville is the best launching point\nin in all of Arkansas honestly if you\nwant to have the amenities of\nhey we got an airport nearby we have\nhotels we have grocery stores we have\nthings that are open 24 7 to bring in\npeople from other states I mean we have\npeople in Colorado that are already\nsigned up Oklahoma you know you have\nsome that's Regional it's Oklahoma they\ncan drive over\num but it's it's for the weekend warrior\nit's you don't have to set aside a week\nor three weeks of your life it's uh I\ncan go and go do this in the weekend go\nhome and then uh Monday I'm back at work\nyou know so that's the whole idea behind\nit is like people that want to\npotentially dabble their toes into what\nis this long distance Ultra cycling what\nis bike packing all this it's\num maybe I want to see some of these\nroads that people are doing on Doom or\nthe High Country but I want to do it\nwith some friends or it'd be part of\nsomething that's organized it's it's\nbasically creating an opportunity that\nhasn't exist existed so far it's let's\nshow you some cool stuff and uh it's\nstill self-supported but yeah I don't\nknow it's like we were talking about I\ndon't know if this before we actually\nstarted recording but it's it's filling\na gap that doesn't exist right now that\nBrandon and I are both really excited\nabout so can I ask one one question\nabout that and then Brandon I want to\ntalk about the Fayetteville and kind of\nthe area that's hosting this but\num so I'll come back to you but\nlike are there number plates and is\nthere a Finish Line and somebody there\nwith a stopwatch so really it's gonna be\nwe're gonna start at the bottom of Dixon\nStreet so you got this Historic downtown\narea of Fayetteville Dixon Street\nis where all the bars are there's a\nbunch of great food options you have\nArkansas you have the the Razorback\nGreenway right there the Arkansas High\nCountry rolls right through it so\nbasically we're starting at the bottom\nof Dixon and we're like all right as a\ngroup we're all climbing up Dixon and\nwe're transitioning out of Fayetteville\nand launching out east Into the Heart of\nthe Ozarks it's I constantly am like\ntelling people about the Buffalo River\nRegion you have America's first national\nRiver the Buffalo National River it's\nabsolutely incredible stunning\nThe riding's Good the scenery is even\nbetter but so yeah it's basically\npeople are getting a tiny little swag\nbag before they start here's here's a\nbandana thanks for signing up here's a\nbandana uh maybe here's a few things\nfrom local businesses race plate\nabsolutely not\num there's not a timing chip uh it's\nreally we have Puritan is going to be\nkind of like the host venue where I'm\njust going to be posted up at Puritan\nwhere there's Wi-Fi and there's food and\nbeverage and as people roll in heck yeah\nyou made it welcome back we have we have\nPuritan open here here's food and\nbeverage right here and you'll pull up\nStrava and be like hey let's see your\nfile you you glance at it you're like\ncool you did the thing awesome job it's\nit's it's structured and unstructured at\nthe same time it's you know the few\npeople that are really trying to gun for\nan fkt or whatever like I'll zoom in way\nmore and be like okay you did the turn\nthere you did the turn there but the\npeople that like hey I just really want\nto make this time cut off and I'm so\nproud that I made it before the 15 hour\nthe 25 hour I'm just gonna like hey let\nme see your Strava file pull it up be\nlike yeah this checks out you did the\nroute good job and then you get like\nanother raffle ticket and maybe you get\nsome extra swag so it's uh yeah this is\nlike I don't know it's kind of like bike\npacking where\nwith doom we're hanging out in o'ark\nArkansas nothing's happening like you're\nsitting in a couple camp chairs and\nyou're you're waiting for an hour and\nsomeone shows up and like three people\nringing a cowbell and you're like yeah\nyou know so it's kind of like just\nshowing a glimpse of of what that is\nit's not the it's not the glory of like\na lifetime Grand Prix event it's it's\nGrassroots and it's really about the\nexperience and like the the individual\nJourney it's yeah it's it's something\nI'm very passionate about and I think it\nit shows that crossover into what the\nbike packing world is\nI I can tell you're very passionate\nabout it and I love the downtown\nFayetteville start and I love the start\nat the bottom of Dixon Street I know\nthat street from hanging out after well\nafter the rain to be quite honest in the\nuh First Fayetteville World Cup\ncyclocross race\nand I was thawing my toes out I think at\na pizza joint down there but\num Brennan tell me about hosting this\nevent and how it fits in you got I just\nwant to list this stuff because\nwe started out in the fall of 21 is that\nright correct fall of 21 with the\nFayetteville World Cup cyclocross race\non a Wednesday yep UCI World Cup\nFayetteville I think is the official\ntitle because they've got you know fun\nnames for that but I get it on a very\nwet Wednesday afternoon wet Wednesday I\nwill also say that that was also smack\ndab in the heart the middle of the\nArkansas High Country oh boy those two\nthings were going on simultaneously and\nat the time Fayetteville was serving as\nthe host Community the start and finish\nline for that thousand Thirty mile race\nit's since moved on to Hot Springs which\nis I think is a fantastic conversation\nfor another time but\num the fact is we were we had multiple\nthings going on at one time that weekend\nor that week and so yeah it was it was a\nwild week for sure so yeah you are\nalways keeping a bunch of balls in the\nair for sure\num you we've hosted Another World Cup\nsince then the cycle cars World\nChampionships U.S mountain bike Cup\nraces\num\nthe high country race Doom is uh nearby\nuh well does uh big sugar touch you or\nis that go that goes north doesn't it\nthat goes north into Missouri yeah we're\nalso home to the only and this is I know\nthis is a Hot Topic but we're also home\nto the highlands gravel classic which is\ncool right UCI where it's the only UCI\ngravel world to qualifier in the states\nthat happens right here in Fayetteville\nas well and so man we're all in from\nfrom sport we're heavily invested in\nsport we're heavily invested in\num the needs of U.S athletes as it\npertains to Sport and that's across\neverything from Road cycling\nfayetteville's home to the Joe Martin\nstage race which is the longest running\nstage race in America we're about to get\ninto the 46th edition of that in about\nthree weeks from now and then you know\nthe gravel riding is so authentic and I\nthink that's why when we look at events\nlike the like the Rand denier and you\nknow what Andrew's doing with the Ozark\ngravel cyclist which is absolutely\nsomething we should touch on before\nbefore we're done because as a\nnon-profit they're doing some really\ngood things and it's through that\nnon-profit that I'm supporting Andrew in\nhis efforts to develop events like this\nOzark engineer where you have an event\nthat you know I love this winning is\njust finishing we're going to celebrate\ncamaraderie over competition you know\nrules are at a minimum I can sign up\nwith my buddy I can draft I can work\ntogether hey you carry the pump I'll\ncarry the tires whatever it's it's a\nrace against the clock and so it kind of\nit does remove some of those more and I\nthink they're there for a reason in\ndifferent bike packing events I think\nthere's a reason for the self-supported\nbut it if that's a barrier for dipping\nyour toe in this let's remove that let's\nlet you get out there and experience\nriding through the night with your\nbuddies in a way that's that's\ncomfortable for you or a setting that\nyou're willing to at least try it and I\nthink you know he said a home run here\nas you know when I ask him to like what\ndo we not have he's like this is what we\ndon't have and I'm like this is\nbrilliant and so I'm super excited and\nand it works because it's authentic you\nknow we're going to start from the heart\nof downtown Fayetteville this historic\nEntertainment District we're going to\nroll out of town climbing up Dixon of\ncourse Andrew would start a race up a\nhill because why not but but you know\nand then we're gonna dive into the\nBoston mountains and as Andrew said that\nis truly like that is one of the most\nlargely untouched areas of all the\nOzarks it is it is remote it is Iconic\nit is beautiful it is hard and it is\nchallenging but again we're doing we're\ncreating a a platform where you can you\ncan put yourself into that environment\nyou can put yourself into those\nuncomfortable places but do so with your\nbuddies and and feel like you can you\ncan finish it off and so\num so yeah super stoked to have it in\nFayetteville again Andrew touched on it\nwe've got you know listen we're simple\ncreatures I get the cycling tourist I'm\none myself I want to eat local I want to\ndrink local typically beer than coffee\nin that order and we have all those\nright from the Puritans to the fossil\ncoves to the hugos I mean whatever\nyou're looking for we have it very\nauthentically great flavors we've got a\nnatural grocer right there on the corner\nof Dixon Street really easy to get to\nfor athletes that they're looking to to\ngrab some food before the race starts um\nand as he said when it finishes it's\ngoing to finish it that Puritan coffee\nand beer which is one of the coolest\nlittle coffee shops in all of\nFayetteville so I'm pretty stoked on\nthat\nand it works because I mean these are\nsome things people don't know when they\nthink of Arkansas but Dave we have the\n10th most miles of gravel roads in the\ncountry and that's not per area Arkansas\nis not exactly a big state we just have\na whole lot of gravel we've got 69 000\nmiles of gravel roads in Arkansas and 85\npercent of our County Roads across the\nstate are gravel and in Washington\nCounty which Fayetteville is the county\nseat I'm giving you a bunch of numbers\nnow I love it I love it we've got a 900\nwe've got a 900 mile County Road Network\n500 miles of those are gravel and so you\ncan see how an event like the Arkansas\nHigh Country or the Ozark engineer work\nand they work really really well because\nwithin a few miles outside of town\nyou're picking up some truly iconic\ngravel and then you're going to stay on\ngravel for most of the ride I was\nactually going to ask about the gravel\nscene outside of Fayetteville I have not\nyet discovered it we've touched gravel\nusually when we're down there we're\nriding mountain bike trails which are\nawesome uh actually incredible and I\nhave not ventured into the gravel and\nI'm super intrigued\nby the gravel yes and no I'm kind of not\nsuper intrigued because it can't do\nanything but go up or down\num that's the Ozarks right I mean it's\nthe Ozark Mountains right right and that\nwell that's what it is though it's in a\nvery you know we have this direct\nconnection fayetteville's back door you\nknow it's all the Ozarks but the reality\nis is the Ozarks are different you've\ngot the Springfield Plateau up north in\nthe Missouri area you've got the Boston\nmountains down here around Fayetteville\nso our backyard is authentically it is\nthe postcard when you see the Ozarks\nthat's fayetteville's backyard and that\nOzark National Forest one point I'm\ngonna get this wrong 1.2 or 1.3 million\nAcres of public land it's accessible\nfrom Fayetteville and that's why this\nstuff works it is that Ozark National\nForest it is that direct access to these\nreally remote beautiful roads and uh\nyeah they get a little Rowdy but that's\npart of the fun uh Andrew\nyou okay there's 500 miles in your\ncounty of gravel roads and 69\n000 miles of uh gravel in Arkansas yeah\nAndrew how did you come up with the\nroutes uh 120 miles or 200 miles yeah\nfor the uh random\nI think that's what's gonna end up\nturning into you know okay thank you the\nBrandon ear is like kind of explaining\nthe the ethos of it and where the idea\ncame from came from but it's like\nhonestly everybody's gonna end up\ncalling the Ozark Rando is what it is\nyou know those are Grando and it just it\nhas right into it osrand maybe randos\nhow's your hand sorry\num but yeah as far as coming up with\nlike okay which which roads how how do\nyou choose this route uh the thing is\nthere's a few things I love\nand it's the Arkansas High Country route\nit's the Doom route that I made myself\nand as Brandon touched on earlier\nthere's also the highlands classic that\nis very unique to Fayetteville and tied\nin with UCI that I think is very unique\nas well Madison County is honestly just\nSuper Rad and it's just east of\nFayetteville it's it's kind of unreal\nhow few people ride in Madison County\nyou have these different pockets and the\nthing is people love starting from their\nfront door and ending at their front\ndoor and so like if you live in\nBentonville the thing is you're going to\nride towards Pea Ridge\nor you're going to ride up into Missouri\num if you live in Fayetteville you might\nnot really get too far into Madison\nCounty unless you're having a bigger day\nbut the thing is it's just anytime I go\nfor a big ride I want to go towards the\nBuffalo National River that's that's\nwhere I'm trying to go just because it's\nthe scenery for one it just it's it's\nmind-blowing and the tiny little\ncommunities that you go through and\nthese mom and pop stores and it's still\nthe old school pumps where it's\nif you you can't you can push your card\nagainst the old school pump a million\ntimes nothing's gonna happen you're\ngonna have to walk inside and say Hey I\nwant gas and interact with a human and\nif they're not there you're not getting\ngas you know wow\nso it's combining initially leaving\nFayetteville\nit's kind of like the classic way if I\nwas to ride East out of Fayetteville\nthat's how this route starts like any\ngiven time from my house this route goes\nalmost directly by my house that I'm\nliving in right now and\nlike I could I could step out of my\nhouse throw a rock and I would hit the\ngrand apart of this this event\nand you go out east and very quickly\nyou're you're already in it you know\nyou're you're going by lake lake Sequoia\nyou're climbing gravel you start getting\nthese sweeping views of Madison County\nhere up on a Ridgeline and it's\nbeautiful as you're leaving you're going\neast\nyou're getting these sweeping views of\nthe entire area and\nit's basically you got the highlands\nwhich Brandon honestly we've never even\ntalked about this were you were you a\npart of creating that that route itself\nI'm sure you're a big part did you\ncreate the whole route I did I did this\nwhich is badass you know you have you\nhave Brandon pack here that he created a\nUCI gravel route you know and so we're\nutilizing part of that\nleaving Fayetteville and then from there\nit's here's just some some roads that I\nlove going out towards Kingston and\nbefore you know it you're connecting the\nArkansas High Country you leave Arkansas\nHigh Country for a little bit you\nconnect back to it do a little bit more\nof the High Country and then you're\nconnecting to Doom Doom is something I\ncreated and it's because it's something\nI absolutely love and that's that's\nroads that I rode a million times and\ndecided this is what I want people to\nsee so basically we're combining three\nthings that are bringing in a national\nand even International audience it's we\ngot the highlands classic we got\nArkansas High Country we got doom and\nit's so it's just like it just makes\nsense the fact that you can do this from\ndowntown Fayetteville is insane and not\nonly that it's like you don't have to\ncommit days on end it's\n25 hours or less if you're doing the\nlong route if you don't quite meet the\ncut off I'm devastated I'm still\ncelebrating you but you're not a\nfinisher of that year right\num but yeah it's a weekend weekend\nexperience that's\num world-class caliber you know\nand kind of the beauty is like the GPX\nfiles are out there if somebody wants to\ndownload them onto their uh head unit\nthey can do that and go ride them any\nday\nyes that's something I'm very adamant\nabout is I I celebrate itts or people\njust doing things on their own time\nI think being part of the event is very\nvery cool but it can't fit into\neverybody's life and their schedule so\nthe fact that if anyone ever wants to\nshow up and do a route is an honor no\nmatter what if you want to be part of\nthe grand depart that's just a bonus so\nit's yeah that resource is always there\nand it's free so if someone's like well\nI don't want to pay 50 for a raffle\nfifty dollars\nand this you know so it's uh at the end\nof the day it's it's always there the\nwhole route library is free The\nExperience Fayetteville route libraries\nfree it's we're putting a lot of\nresources out there just to say hey this\nis this is a cool area go check it out\nbut occasionally it's like hey let's put\non an event and make it even cooler\nsuper cool\nuh one question I have about that is 200\nmiles could be a big chunk for somebody\nto bite off but if you had bags and you\nhad a sleeping bag and a stove and a\ntent\nare there places to stop and and sleep\non the 120 200 mile routes absolutely so\nI have both the like can people do some\nthree-day bike packing trips yeah from\nDixon Street in Fayetteville that's a\ngreat point I I should go in so these\nroute files I have the files up already\nto where here's the route these are the\nroads I have some pois on there\num but I can go in and still and that's\nmy plan is to be adding more I was I was\nhonestly focused on on Doom for a little\nbit because that just happened I think\nthree weeks ago at this point\num so a lot of answering questions for\nthat and getting everybody ready for it\nwe had three people come down from\nCanada which is super cool oh wow um no\nlet's be clear he is race the week of\nDoom and then he did do and then he i t\nthen he attempted in ITT himself so he's\nbeen a little busy that's crazy and then\nI went to California with Ernie but yeah\nthere's there's absolutely places so you\ncan like Huntsville would be 40 miles in\nif you're doing either route Huntsville\nhas options as far as\num if you want to you want to sleep\nthere Kingston has options once you\nleave Kingston uh that's when it starts\ngetting more remote and you're gonna\nhave to Camp you know unless you just\nfind some really random Airbnb or\nsomething which is cool I mean that\nthat's I think that's kind of a fun\nopportunity and\nI think it's super cool that these\nroutes exist all of them\nthat you're putting out there that allow\nsomebody to Stage out of Fayetteville\num Brennan I'm sure the Airbnb the hotel\nmotel The VRBO scene in Fayetteville is\nsecond to none uh stay a dare it's\nrobust\num stay there a night or two and then\nhead out for three days and do your 200\nmile route and come back and\nhave a beer there's a brewery on that\nsquiggly Hill coming up into downtown\nfrom the\nI don't crisis Brewing yeah that's the\none I always had it's right next to\nPenguin ads that's the combo man if\nyou're if you know what you're doing you\nyou head to crisis because right next\ndoor is penguin EDS and so you can have\nsome of the best barbecue in town and\nsome of the best you know craft Brews\nand you can do it all around a fire pit\noutside it's it's pretty rad it\ndefinitely is they actually you know\nthey work if next time\nfair enough fair enough well it is a\ngood Brewery and I've been there several\ntimes but anyway\nso this is a this\nparticular event is a fundraiser for the\nOzark gravel cyclists Andrew you are the\nfounder I don't know if your director it\ndoesn't say that I don't know if you're\nthe executive director or the CEO or the\nwhatever but um what the heck is Ozark\ngravel cyclists what do you do what's it\nfor\nand\num I don't know\ntell us all about it that's a great\nquestion\num I mean honestly Brandon's one of the\nfirst people that uh kind of caught on\nto what was happening and it was\nlike at the very at the very start is me\nand my good friend Jesse Turner that I\nnow live with I'm sitting in my bedroom\nin a house living with Jesse Turner and\nI had moved from Utah and I had just got\ninvolved with the cycling team out there\nright before coven I was all excited to\nhave community and people to ride bikes\nwith and go to events with that's that's\nwhat it was I was like this is so cool I\nhad a background of riding fixed gear\nbikes by myself and I finally was part\nof a group and it was the coolest thing\never to me and so I got all excited\ncovet happened and no events were\nhappening and I ended up moving back to\nArkansas and Jesse was the only people I\nknew in Arkansas that was riding bikes\nand he was riding gravel and so we\nconnected very early on and I was like\nhey I'm very motivated to go ride bikes\nI want to I want to explore as much as\npossible I want to go to events I want\nto like I want to do all the things and\nso he's like that sounds awesome let's\ndo it\nand so immediately you know our very\nfirst ride together we didn't even know\neach other that well uh we did a 100\nmile route from Lake Fort Smith and it\nwas a ton of gravel and Fayetteville was\nour halfway point and Fayetteville was\nkind of the sanctuary we were able to\nget coffee we got Onyx Coffee we got\nsome food we're like this is so sweet\nthat halfway through a ride of like Epic\nProportions we can be in Civilization\nand get everything we want and then we\nfinish back down in lake Fort Smith and\nfrom there it's like let's let's get\nmore people involved like who else is\nriding gravel as like their primary\nmeans of like riding bikes you know and\nso like started branching out and\nfinding more people started a social\nmedia account and like over time got\nlike more people interested uh Jesse and\nI rode the Arkansas High Country that's\nlike by then Brandon was definitely\ntuned in because his\nbecause of his job and just like his his\nlove for Arkansas gravel and bike\npacking and cycling in general he he\nfollowed our whole journey and like\nafterwards he even called me he's like\nhey what are you guys trying to do uh\nlike I remember that he he called me I'm\nsitting at his at Jesse's parents house\nyou know destroyed from riding the\nArkansas High Country and Brandon's\ntalking to me on the phone saying what's\nnext what what are you guys trying to do\nyou know\nand so like in a nutshell it's it\nstarted as these are people that want to\ngo explore Arkansas back roads and it's\nprimarily on unpaved and after a while\nit turned into a group ride hey every\nweek we're doing a group ride from\ndowntown Fayetteville and that's at\nPuritan\nand then it's occasionally hey we're\ndoing a group ride once a month that's\nnot downtown Fayetteville it's middle of\nnowhere Arkansas but it's in the Ozarks\nand it's beautiful and it's awesome and\nthen it kind of like snowballed into hey\nthere's this new route this new event\nand people are flying in from Washington\nand Canada and driving from Chicago and\ndoing this thing called Doom that sounds\nintimidating but then they show up and\neverybody's super friendly and just\nsuper happy that they're there\nat some point basically formed a 501c3\nthat's like hey\num there's there's something here let's\nlet's really provide something cool for\nthe community and that's and it's\nEmbassy stage right now and it's\nwhat can we do to help people out well\nfor one we can give a bunch of routes\nfor people to go ride that's in the\nmiddle of nowhere where they otherwise\nyou'd have no clue what to do like out\nnear the Buffalo River one road to the\nleft or to the right can vastly change\nwhat your entire ride is that day you\nknow someone may be planning on a\nthree-hour ride and uh they take one\nroad different and that turns into a\nfive hour ride you know so\num it's creating routes it's it's a\ncommunity it's putting on events would\nlove to do more clinics just like hey\nthis is how to pack for an overnighter\nit's introducing people to gravel\ncycling it's showing that it is a\nwelcoming community and that we're happy\npeople are out there and wanting to\nexplore so it's a combination of a lot\nof things but I was our gravel cyclists\nlike an it's it's basically it's a\ncommunity that's very excited on riding\ngravel roads and trying to include\nanybody that's interested doesn't matter\nwho you are or what bike you're on or\nwhat tires I don't care if you're riding\na mountain bike from the 80s or if\nyou're riding a s Works diverge you know\num either way if you want to go ride\nthese back roads in Arkansas I'm stoked\nfor you so\num as we grow there's there's a lot of\npotential in what we can do because\nArkansas really is is blowing up as far\nas a a hub for off-road cycling whether\nit be mountain biking or gravel and\nhaving partners like experience\nFayetteville is only helping grow that\nquicker and providing a lot more\nresources so it's uh it's like a newer\nthing and uh it's really exciting\nbut yeah you got events like Doom\nstarted up and the thing is I just I\nwant people to know that it's it's not\nonly for the quote-unquote most extreme\nhardcore people it's it's about\neverybody so we our weekly ride we have\na social version where it's people show\nup with Chacos and have a basket on the\nfront of their bike and you you stop and\nyou take photos of a horse that's right\nthere you uh might pet a dog you might\nuh\nhave a little shot of Fireball or\nsomething if you're feeling frisky you\nknow it's it's for it's for anybody it's\nnot like hey you have to be wearing a\nskin suit and drilling it you know and\nthen\num Doom is like that far end of the\nspectrum as far as like ultra distance\nbut the Rando is kind of showing that\nhey\nwe we want people to see what that's\nlike and here's some examples of roads\nthat you can cover and then even with\nour route library of here's a 20 mile\nroute here's a 30 mile route and uh yeah\nso it's like we're doing a lot and\ntrying to narrow our focus in a way but\nit's also like we we care about a lot of\ndifferent disciplines in people so it's\nwe don't want to pigeonhole into one\nthing because it's if you're if you're\non a bike and you're riding unpaved\nsurfaces in Arkansas Northwest Arkansas\nwe're excited for you so even if it's\nmountain bikes there's crossover in that\ntoo\nDave you said you didn't want to do any\nedits buddy I'm getting to do some edits\nthat's uh there you go made it\n31-13 so at least I know where to go he\njust disappeared uh all together\ncompletely yeah I think he's gonna find\nsome better service and and come back to\nus and so I I want to know about well I\nwant to you can do experience\nFayetteville but I want to know about\nthe\nUCI\ngravel race when is it oh yeah what is\nit how do people get in the highlands\nlove it love it tell me about the\nhighlands race so we've got the\nhighlands gravel classic which is a it\nis the only North American or the only\nU.S\num qualifier in the UCI gravel World\nSeries which started last year\num 25 of the athletes that compete if\nyou finish within the top 25 percent of\nyour age category you qualify for World\nChampionships in Italy later this year\nwe're not blind we're not buying your\nplane ticket but we're getting your\nentry in and so it's the one opportunity\non this Con well in the U.S I think\nthere is a Canadian race so I won't say\nthis continent but it's one of two races\nin North America if you um you know if\nthat resonates with you if you if you're\ninto sport if and we're saying listen\ngravel is huge it's growing it makes a\nlot of sense that organizations like USA\ncycling and UCI at some point are going\nto get involved um I I do like the way\nthat they're dipping their toe into\ngravel they're they're managing it\num much like they would their grand\nfondos familiar with the way the UCI\ndoes their grand Fondo series and their\nWorld Championships it's age-based and\nso they're doing doing these races very\nsimilar to where they're not it's not\nlosing that come we talk about gravel\nand the camaraderie and and the uh the\nshared experiences that comes with you\nknow going to a gravel event and lining\nup with some of the top cyclists in the\nworld and just having that shared\nexperience you're not going to finish\nfirst that's okay I'm not going to be at\nthe pointy end of anything at this point\nbut I'm going to go out there and I'm\ngoing to have that shared experience I'm\ngoing to give it my all and events like\nthis Highlands gravel classic are\ncreating that platform for folks that\nare looking to compete at a high level\nat regardless of what their age is they\ncan compete in those age-based races and\nget a chance to qualify for the World\nChampionship it utilizes that Madison\nCounty that\num that that Andrew talked about where\nreally mile for mile day 95 of the\ncourse is gravel\nthat was a question I was going to ask\ndid you\nsee the uci's race last year and the\nworld championship\ngravel race last year I I did so it's\nvery different than U.S gravel where U.S\ngravel like we all leave together\ngenerally and it's\npretty much all gravel it over in Europe\nit was\nsectors of gravel much like a Perry Ruby\nor the strata Bianca where you have\nsection long sections of pavement and\nthen you dive onto gravel for\nI don't know one three 10K or whatever\nyeah I don't I don't think we can get\naway and yeah well I understand you know\nthere maybe they're capitalizing on the\ngravel that they have access to\num that said\nin from Fayetteville in Washington and\nMadison County we have a lot and so\nwe're able to create race courses that\nare closer to almost 100 gravel as is\nthe case with the highlands gravel\nclassic it's Saturday June 24th you can\nstill sign up I encourage you to it's\nhighlandsgravel classic.com I've got two\naction-packed routes depend on your age\nthe other thing is it's this is a little\nbreak from tradition when I show up to a\nus-based gravel race I'm probably\nlooking for 100 miles right for the UCI\nand their events they've kind of\nnarrowed in on that 100K Mark for their\nqualifiers so we're kind of around that\n100K 63 to 65 mile Mark still a lot of\nclimbing it is the Boston mountains\num we talk about that but I guess the\nbest way I could describe the Boston's\nis so one the Ozark Mountains are the\nonly contiguous range between the\nbetween the Rockies and the Appalachians\npeople think in Northwest Arkansas and\nthey don't think of mountains but we\nhave them and with that it's the\ngreatest relief between the two so I\nmean across call it the Heartland or the\nMidwest or or the South wherever we're\nat you know it's really the highest\nrelief from the Peaks and valleys so you\nknow the elevation gets up to about 2500\nfeet in that race but it gets as low at\nabout 1500 feet when you hit the valleys\nand so you can see where it's just\nconstant undulation and that's racing in\nthe Ozarks man it's it's a it's Death By\nA Thousand Cuts you're gonna climb for\nyou know short Punchy one two mile\nclimbs and then you're gonna just get in\nyour drops and just rip it downhill for\nanother two miles and then you're gonna\nturn around and do that again and that's\nwhat riding in the Ozarks is like and\nyou know so Andrew will talk to this you\nknow the tire volume is that's a big\nquestion and you know if you show up\nwith 28 C's in Ozarks you're probably\ngoing to be in pain after about 20 miles\nand so even you know athletes like\nAndrew that are doing big efforts and\naccomplishing big things I mean I think\nAndrew at this Point's under traditional\n2.0 I mean Tire volume in the Ozarks and\neven racing sped them in the bigger\nraces we're seeing wider Tire volume\nbecome more and more common for athletes\nthat are coming here to do events\nwow\num that's a mountain bike tire yeah yeah\nhuh that's crazy\ndo you think that it's good prep\nfor heading over to Italy\num you know I guess that depends on the\nyear right the world championship like\nanything is going to move around at some\npoint it's going to be in the states I\nwill be absolutely advocating that as a\nqualifier maybe someday we're hosting\nWorld Championships of gravel right here\nin Fayetteville Dave you got to believe\nthat's on my list that would be super\ncool but that said I just think it you\nknow I think I haven't experienced you\nknow gravel in you know South America I\nhaven't experienced gravel in Europe and\nand I think depending on the continent\nwhere you're at you're probably going to\nexperience some different gravel we've\ngot rocky Rudy roads at times where you\ngo to some other places go out west and\nit's just I mean it's something I would\ncall more of a dirt road right where\nit's really fine and then you look at\nlike you said the it's almost the White\nSands of Italy the gravel roads over\nthere are you know they're just they're\nbeautiful and they're iconic but there's\nthere's not a much there's not a lot of\ntechnical to it so I think it I think\nthat just depends I mean as they move\nlike gravel you're gonna you know smart\nroute designers like Andrew or you're\ngonna you're gonna build to what you\nknow the topography and the terrain\ngives you and and I think depending on\nwhere they put that event and you're\ngonna is that's what you're gonna\nexperience that said when you come to\nexperience the highlands gravel classic\nyou're going to have a very authentic\nAmerican gravel experience to where\nthere's a whole lot of gravel on that\nroute and it is traditional when we\nthink about gravel it's exactly that\nit's not the Flint Hills I don't you're\nnot gonna it's not a bunch of sharp Rock\nbut it's um you know there's plenty of\nrock for sure dig it dig it I appreciate\nso you're gonna uh talk about experience\nFayetteville a minute ago yeah so from a\nyou know from uh staying on this gravel\ntheme because we'll just we'll stay\nthere but um experience forever we\npartnered with Ride with GPS for our\nroute development needs and I utilize\nthat to build out a full catalog of\ngravel experience for our gravel cycling\ntourists because that's become the thing\nyou talk about coming to Northwest\nArkansas to to ride mountain bikes more\nand more I'm getting inquiries from\nfolks that want to come here and have\ntwo three four day gravel experiences\nand they want to do that from our BNB\nthey want to do that from a hotel\nbecause when they're done they just want\nto go to the bars and eat the local food\nlike mountain bikers do and so I've\nstarted developing a full counter its\nown experience fable.com there's a\ngravel section and you can go there and\nI've got a full catalog of vetted gravel\nroutes that are kind of that tourism\nfield there are 25 to 50 miles you know\nthey have at around 50 miles I make sure\nto bake in some kind of mid-ride Aid be\nat a gas station or a restaurant or\nsomething and then I you know anything\nbigger than that I leave to the crazy\nkids like Andrew because we know when\nyou start to when you start to expand\nthose routes\num you know it requires a level of Aid\nand support a lot of times unless you're\ngoing to do it self-supported but um I\nthink we've kind of found the sweet spot\nfor maturism everybody thinks they want\nto ride 100 miles in the Ozarks until\nthey come to the Ozarks Bay and then\nthey're like okay we get it so there's\nsome amazing like you know just party\nPace routes we put together bring your\nfriends I've got all the routes out\nthere available grab them go ride them\nhave a good time and when you're ready\nto race that's why we've got\norganizations like the the Ozark gravel\ncyclist and Andrew putting things\ntogether Ah that's genius so I can go to\nexperience Fayetteville\nand find 25 to 50 mile routes to load\nonto my head unit and then just go ride\nthat's genius ready to go I give you a\nfull rate Brown rate I'll give you a\nfull route breakdown I give you all the\npoints of interest I tell you where\nyou're going to get water where you can\nfind food I give you the mountain peaks\nI give you the photographic spots and\nyou can do it all from town I've\nliterally been looking for that that's\nawesome I'll share the link and you can\nput it in the show notes I'll put it in\nthe show notes 100 100 percent\nuh so you guys are doing awesome things\ndown there Brandon I'm going to be your\nmarketing director here for a minute and\nif Bentonville can just say mountain\nbike capital of the world I feel like\nwith what you guys are doing down there\nuh gravel capital of the world\nI don't listen we I\nappreciate uh listen binville's doing\nsome really rad stuff let's be clear no\nno you know if you want to you know we\ncan Snicker at you know the trademark\nand stuff like that but the reality is\ngo ride mountain bikes there and then\ntell me it's not a really rad place to\nride a bicycle because because 100 is\nyeah um you know I think for us you know\nin Fayetteville cycling's just a pillar\nDave it's part of our culture it's baked\nin we're a college town the University\nof Arkansas the Razorbacks are right\nhere blue Pig you know there's an SEC\nschool at the bottom of Dixon\num you know and because of that we just\nwe had this Rich history of cycling and\nso everything we do is typically\ncultivated from the ground up the Ozark\ngravel cyclist is a great example of a\nof a startup non-profit working directly\nwith local business owners to create\nthese authentic cycling hubs and these\njumping off points for the community\nthat also become the same junk being off\npoints that you're looking for when\nyou're coming to town to have a gravel\nor mountain bike experience yourself and\nso Andrew and his team are they're\nthey're cultivating these relationships\nthat we look for and then at that same\nregard you know Fayetteville is an\naward-winning community and it and and\nwe've won a lot of awards from others so\nthe league of American bicyclists I'll\nrun through these real quick with the\nleague of American bicyclists recognizes\nFable as the only goal level\nbicycle-friendly community in the entire\nstate of Arkansas the only one we've got\n50 50 bicycle friendly businesses that's\nthe third most in the entire country\nwe're the only UCI bike label in the\nUnited States so we're the only\ncommunity in the United States to\nreceive what I believe is a pretty\nprestigious award it's not a lampshade\nbut it's still pretty damn cool in the\nsense that the UCI has recognized\nFayetteville for its commitment both in\nsport which we've talked a lot about but\nalso cycling for all that community that\nculture building that Fayetteville has\njust simply been doing for decades and\nso I think that's when you come to\nFayetteville I promise you a very\nauthentic experience I promise you some\nreally cool folks riding bikes like\nAndrew and the Ozark gravel cyclist if\nyou're looking for a 25 mile ride we got\nthat if you just want to go break\nyourself on the Ozark Grand denier we'll\nsee you in September\nawesome I love it we should uh rip down\nthrough the dates of all all of the\nstuff we talked about the Ozark Brandon\near September 16 17. correct yeah 16th\nif you're doing the 120 you dip into the\n17th if you're uh doing the 200 if\nyou're if you're wildly fast maybe\nyou're still on the 16th but yeah 16th\nand 17th that weekend\nBrennan when is the\nUCI qualifier the highlands Highlands\ngravel classic is June the weekend of\nJune I think it's the 24th this year\nmight be the 23rd I don't have a\ncalendar in front of me but it's that\nit's that last weekend in June June 23rd\nof 24th it starts from this super cool\nlittle barn on the east side of\nFayetteville very authentic Ozarks and\nwe get lost in the woods real quick so I\nencourage it and again I know it has\nthat UCI kind of qualifier about it but\nat the end of the day it's just a really\nrad authentic gravel experience and I\ninvite folks to come to town and\nexperience it for themselves\nuh banjo's plan\nno no banjos you know you're going to\nget some you know maybe some barking\ndogs and you know typically you know\nlisten you know oh folk listen most\nfolks are friendly out there man it's\nyou know for the most part\num I've ridden like Andrew I've done a\nlot of writing I was actually part of um\nChuck Campbell speaking of the High\nCountry back into it's his fault I blame\nhim to this day in 2016 he wrote me into\nlike the original scouting routes for\nthe Arkansas High Country what would\nbecome the Arkansas High Country course\nand race and at the time I I didn't know\nwhat bike backing was and he's like yeah\nwe're gonna do this thing and and we're\njust going to be Weekend Warriors about\nit and so I spent several weekends\nleading up to the development of that\njust riding with him following him and\nhe literally had the gazetteer strapped\nto the bars there was no Compass there\nwas no GPS I was following uh just this\nI'm gonna call him an old man they can\nclimb like he's 18. and and following\nhim on these highlighted lines he has on\nthe map and it's one of the most amazing\nexperiences I've ever had and then in\n2019 I got to\num build a route and we went all the way\nacross the state on gravel and so I just\nI I don't even know what your question\nwas at this point but I'm going to tell\nyou that like I don't care if you want\nto ride in the Northeast the Northwest\nthe delta or Central Arkansas there is\namazing gravel experiences across the\nstate that's awesome uh Andrew when is\nArkansas High Country race uh it's going\nto be on October\nseventh let me let me actually look at\nthe calendar October 7th Saturday\nOctober 7th uh that'll be the grand\nDepartment that's a freaking Thousand\nMile yeah and that's gonna also\nincorporate the South the South Loop of\nArkansas High Country and also the\nOuachita Triple Crown which goes\nbasically you\nyou do an Outback from Hot Springs but\nyou go do an epic single track Journey\naround Lake Ouachita and then come back\nuh that's that's awesome and doom is a\nspring event Doom is a spring event\nthey'll stay spring The more I've talked\nto people it fits in really well\num I really liked having it a little bit\nearlier this year to where things are\nstarting to grow in but you can still\nsee through all the trees really well\nyou get some like surprise bonus views\nof like rock formations and you can see\nthe Rolling Hills and some more Rivers\nand Creeks so I like I like it being\nearly it's before water levels get\nexcessively high as far as all the creek\ncrossings and everything\nbut yeah they'll stay spring next year\nwe actually have this pretty wild\nEclipse that's happening in Arkansas\num that I think it's gonna the timing's\ngonna be right around right around Doom\nI like the Easter the Easter weekend-ish\ntime frame I think it's gonna stick to\nthat this past year I had a Easter bunny\nears on with my scream mask as I handed\nout gremlin bells to everybody they were\nin uh Easter eggs it was a nice touch\neverybody liked it um\nyeah a lot of cool stuff in Arkansas all\nyear\num um I've got information about the\nOzark grandineer soon to be called the\nOzark Rando which I like\num as well as the highlands gravel\nclassic again we're event Rich there's a\nfull I don't want to say catalog there's\nso many rad cycling events in\nFayetteville that we produce a 101 every\nyear so there's a full article that is\njust a 101 of all the cycling events\nhappening in Fayetteville and Northwest\nArkansas so I encourage everyone to to\ngo check that out at experiencebaba.com\nlike I said we've got a great gravel\nroute catalog on there as well so if you\nwant to come to town and you're looking\nto you got that long weekend and you\nwant to have a you know a few stacked\ndays of gravel riding I've got some\ngreat routes on on there that I would\nlove for\num Dave come down man we'll go ride some\nourselves I'm in I'm 100 and you guys I\nreally appreciate you making time and\nand carving time out I know it was tough\nto get three of us together freaking you\nboth have been so busy it's crazy\num but I really appreciate it and uh see\nyou down there for some sweet gravel\nsome sweet single track some good beer\nsome good coffee and great food some\nrandom earrings Dave we're gonna do some\nrandom earrings some random earrings\ngo to a random a and be a Randon ear is\nthat right that's right Andrew is that\nright\nI\nlove it just say yes we're good yeah\nwe're gonna say yes there you go good\nanswer that is a good answer\nI lost you guys for a second but as far\nas Dave being a random air 100 yes\nyeah\num if we're wrapping up I do I do want\nto touch on on something\nuh because I know this this will come up\nin uh Instagram messages or emails or\nwhatever otherwise so as far as those\nare granded near 120 which would be the\nshorter of the two options\n38c Tire would be my minimum\nrecommendation\nyou'll be primarily hard packed gravel\nwith some some dashes of what I would\ncall slightly rowdier with like maybe\nthere's some baby head rocks thrown in\nthat you need to like finesse around or\nmaybe you're just kind of getting\nAirborne every once in a while depending\non how quickly you're going so that'd be\nthe Ozark randoneer 120 I would say 38c\nwould be my minimum recommendation you\ncan absolutely do it on a cycle cross\nbike and if you're limited to 33 don't\nfeel like oh no I can't do this now but\nas soon as we jump into like the ozone\nthe Ozark Randle near 200 that's when\nI would say bump it up to 42c minimum\nand that really boils down to\nthere's this really cool section it's\nhonestly one of my favorite sections in\nall of Arkansas of gravel riding and\nit's from Compton to Peru it\nand I mean for for the 200 that'd come\nin at Mile like 78 so it's not even that\nlate into it but it's\nfrom Compton to Pruitt\nthat's just like this like real proper\nlike this is this is Ozark riding you\ngot this dashes of double track\num Jeep Trail ATV whatever you want to\ncall it\num that just\nyou just you just feel out there you're\nlike oh my gosh I can't believe I left\nFayetteville earlier today and I'm in\nthis right now\num it's part of the Arkansas High\nCountry that's how I first discovered it\nand uh like Compton would be mile like\naround 78 Pruitt's mile 94 so it doesn't\nsound like that far but that given\nsection you'll be like this is taking\nway longer than I ever would have\nguessed and the elevation profile\ndoesn't make it seem that way it's like\nwell a lot of it's mostly downhill but\nit it takes a lot of time and then\nreally from like\nyou also\ndescend\nfrom\nthere's like one more stretch after that\nwhere basically you get over into\nthe Whitaker Point Hawks Hawk spill\nCraig whatever you want to call it\nthat's that's some Rowdy stuff over\nthere too\num so I'd say like 42c tires minimum for\nthe the 200 so just to like give some\npeople some reference neither one would\nI'd say hey this is a mountain bike\ncourse especially with the amount of\npavement sprinkled in and everything and\nit being a one push effort with a nap at\nthe most\num but yeah that's just something I\nwanted to touch on where uh people\nalways want to know about gear and so\nthat's just a little bit of extra\ninsight and that's that's from a lot of\npeople riding out there and kind of like\nGathering like okay what's what's the\nConverses you guys thanks tons for uh\ncoming on all the best this summer all\nthe best uh with all your events and I\ndon't know busy lives it's awesome hope\nyou sneak some riding

      "description": "Rapha puts on these special events called Prestige rides. There once a year and located in some of the craziest places on earth. This once was in the Arkansa Ozarks and OH MY IT WAS AMAZING! \n\nEndless gravel roads made for this cycling adventure to be the best bike trip I have ever taken. Riding gravel bikes on gravel roads with gravel people and gravel gravel gravel, is that good youtube? Will you recommend my gravel ride video to people who like Rapha clothing and gravel bikes and thin mustaches and flavored soda water that tastes like nothing? Thanks, that would be sweet.\n\nHow it works is you have a 4 man team and there is a staggered start so everyone doesnt start at once. The route is announced the night before and there really isnt any support. So there is some navigation aspects to it as well. \n\nAllied cycle works got me dialed in on the best gravel bike I have ever ridden. Just for the weekend though, I didnt get to keep it. We rode around the town on Friday and then the big day on Saturday and then a tour of Walmart on Sunday. \n\nI want to go back so bad, this part of the world was insane! A HUGE thank you ZACHARY PI\u00d1A! This dude made this happen! \n\nAlso, I havent posted a video in a while because I have been hyper focused on work and family. 2019 is gonna be big for cycling and I need to put in the time with the day job and fam to allow for me to accomplish what I want to do in 2019. \n\n////FREE go pro some where on this route \nhttps://www.strava.com/activities/1568293316\n\n/////Hella sick Shirts n stuff\nhttps://www.ridebikesbro.com\n\n/////Get on the Spurlina Train\nhttps://sp2life.com/pages/vegan-cyclist - code Vegan for 30%off\n\n/////Hydration\nwww.Crankednaturals.com - code vegan for 25% off\n\n/////Diamondback deal\nCreate an account and use crop code VEGAN for INSANE deals\nhttps://www.diamondback.com/partner\n\n\n\nfollow me bruh\nhttps://www.facebook.com/theVeganCyclist\nhttps://www.strava.com/athletes/180549\nhttps://www.instagram.com/the_vegan_cyclist/",

      "transcript": "Hey VC here I want to tell you the story\nabout the rah for prestige ride in\nArkansas it was maybe one of the\ngreatest trips I've ever gone on and as\nyou can see now it's freezing and I\ndon't want to be freezing and I'm just\nthinking about times when I was warm and\nthis was a story I have yet to tell you\nI'm gonna like to tell you about this\namazing hundred and thirty mile crazy\ngravel race in Arkansas home of Walmart\nDonets experience here's the story the\nonly way I got this amazing deal was\nthat my guy at true communications\nthey're like a marketing company for a\nlot of cycling brands he hit me up days\nbefore the event just a week before my\nYosemite cycling camp he was like hey\nman we'd love for you to be on this team\nyou know it's like we're paying we're\nflying you out like it's all paid the\nexpense trip you know I mean it's it's a\nreally amazing opportunity but you got\nto jump on a plane like tomorrow so part\nof this was that one my wife's birthday\nwas during the trip and then the very\nnext week like I'd be getting back I\nthink on on Sunday night and then my\nyosemite cycling camp starts Wednesday\nso it was just it was one of those where\nlogically speaking no no I can't go but\nthen I was just really trying to think\nlike man this is a really amazing\nopportunity I don't know how many other\nopportunities I'm gonna get like this I\nknow the wife said yes that I could go\nbut it was like one of those sure do\nwhatever you want I don't care because I\nwas gonna be missing her birthday and\nyou know that's not good so I hit up my\ncontact and I was like bro I've I've\nweighed the pros and cons I may be\nsleeping in the doghouse and this is\ndefinitely not I shouldn't be doing this\nbecause what if I get hurt or something\nhappens I got the cycling camp\nI shouldn't be doing this but I'm gonna\nfull send me happy birthday\nall right so that was a trip why are we\nhere man\nwe're here to ride 120 miles and 7,000\nfeet of the finest roads that the South\nhas to offer\nwhere are we on the globe we are we're\nabout 10 minutes north of the town of\nBentonville Arkansas which is Northwest\nArkansas it's rural man we're out there\nhe we are out there\nyeah there's four of us so you and\nmyself from California got a fella\ncoming out from New York City a writer\nand then a friend of mine coming out Joe\nDiaz from corner so we're all gonna\nconverge four-man team I believe I\nbelieve there's 20 teams everybody rides\nin teams of four essentially you're only\nas fast as your slowest guy so you got\nto finish together start together finish\ntogether you've got an allied bike\ncoming your way and allied is also local\nso gigas hand-built local see I'm gonna\ngo grab bikes go grab Tom you need to\nget some sleep for sure all right and\nthen we will go into town and then ride\naround and explore we'll get some coffee\nit's a party started yeah awesome do it\nsweet no I didn't have a gravel bike and\nI didn't bring a bike at all actually\nallied cycle works was working with\ntheir like Rafa prestige pop-up things\nwe go to this little pop-up so it's a\nRafa store or office store but it's not\npermanent and I got dialed in on this\nlike super-sweet gravel bike with this\nbrakes first time ever riding disc\nbrakes\nI mean I'll say like I freaking love my\ncanyon to the moon and back but boy was\nthis bike comfy trusty steed it's all\ndialed in row\nI'm still pretty tired though from\ntraveling so we're just gonna cruise\naround and check out the town and then\njust kind of hanging out tomorrow's the\nride tomorrow's the big but right now\nwe're hanging out\n[Music]\nthis can be right our navigator here is\njust very good turned around several\ntimes that's good we're venturing out\nI bet this dude on this tractor is like\nwhat's why you got my house bro\n[Applause]\nwe're back at the little pop-up that was\nhere an hour just a little over an hour\nride I'm gonna give a little teaser of\nwhat's to come tomorrow\nthat's just tell me about this town at\nWalmart spaceship\nbig red brick spaceship so Walmart kind\nof built this town I mean everything\naround here sort of popping up because\nof it yeah like a mining town right\nthat's a good way to describe Wow so\nthen what happens so we have this\nawesome epic ride and then we went to\nlike the Rafah pre-party where there was\njust like tons and tons of hipsters\neveryone's being super duper hipstery I\nfeel very like insecure and out of place\nbecause I don't really know I mean yeah\nI'm like hanging with these these three\nother guys but don't really know them\nvery well I'm trying to get to know him\nbut I don't have like a homie with me\nyou know any me and so I just feel kind\nof out of place Lance Armstrong was\nthere it's the first time I've ever seen\nLance Armstrong in person so Lance was\nthere Lance Armstrong with George\nHincapie do you know I gotta say that\nLance was a handsome dude like Lance was\nlooking like no home did he look really\ngood for his age I mean if I aged as\nwell as him I wanted to go up to him and\nsay to get a soundbite I want him to be\nlike vegans are annoying or something\nbut I'd be a really funny soundbite\nI should have loved the game\nI should've bro no the key\nand I'll be fine with it to be the end\nso day two this is the big day\nagain like 130 something miles 11\nsectors of gravel is gonna be epic\nthey have the start these crazy teepees\nand that's like where you register isn't\na teepee like of course hope supster did\nyou guys like some super cool over here\non this awesome couch even a casual man\nbring it from of why I come out why come\nall the way it just sounds like a good\nway to have a good time with our friends\never ridin with really I'm no clue where\nI am say it was misery it's like five\nhours northeast of here and the Ozarks I\nmean we we right in Missouri for part of\nthe ride today so for about five miles\nhow close are we to where the show that\nshows our shows you know empowerment's\nin Branson the show where they do longer\nyeah that's a really good do an amazing\nshow and I want to go there I want to go\nto that strip club in Illinois then they\njust had teams going and going and going\nin it was our turn got called up and we\ntook off dude and we were all like\npretty eager to get going\nnot that everyone wanted a race but we\nwere gonna kind of see like maybe you\nknow maybe\nwe hit the first gravel section and we\nget our first flat and this was the\ntheme of the day bro\nflats right everyone was getting tons of\nflats so we get a flat right off the bat\nand that kind of took the wind out of\nour sails cuz we were sort of like pace\nlining and feeling really good like ah\ndude we're gonna we're gonna race this\nthing so the first gravel section is\ncomplete there's really only 15 miles of\ngravel on this whole course so there's\nnot a ton of gravel but dude there was\nfour teams got flat stirring five times\nwell almost every team got a flat\nlet's give me the name of the game don't\nget flats this is such a sick route tuck\nhurdle that off there's a little turtle\nright there\nbro such an awesome ride\nwhen the stars close bro\nsummers all in the mr. Bryton\nwe're told when the storm is raging your\nhead you feel there's nothing more\nyes they same agreement the\nyou can't hold my hand as you reach\nthe hills by the lake you shaysing you\ncream and I gave you a rose how you care\nso when they shtetl and they start this\nat the staggered start\nso everyone goes off in like one minute\nincrements so it's really fun because\nwe're constantly catching groups and\ngroups coming onto us and it's fine did\nit's a fun format is it's a fun ride but\nI'd like the third flat we sort of were\njust in it for the enjoyment right we're\nnot really racing we're not trying to go\nsuper hard we're just going to enjoy\nwhat ended up being maybe one of my\nfavorite trips or rides I've ever done\nthe scenery was unreal and maybe it's\njust because like I don't it's it's\nanother part of the world right like\nwhere I am at where I'm at\nthere's mountains and there's pine trees\nbut there it's totally different the the\nroads are just these undulating rolling\nhills the trees are like much more thick\nthere's a lot of green we're we're\nripping down this dirt road freaking\nbeautiful sheer cliff off to the left\ninto like a river very steep very big\ndrum with barbed wire fence along I had\nmy GoPro oh dude I'm getting this a cat\nshots now and then I drop it and it's\nbouncing and it's like no big deal dude\nit's in a case so durable and so I'm\nwatching it tumble and tumble and tumble\nand I'm like okay no big deal cool cool\nand then it bounces the weirdest just\nleft a balance off into the river\ndude I just dropped my GoPro who's in my\nhand I dropped it and I think it went\noff this clip dude\nnah dude I think my GoPro is gone\ndude my GoPros like yeah if you want to\nquickly take one of the best rides\nyou've ever done and make it not as\ngreat\nthrow your $500 GoPro with your\nhundred-dollar memory card and all the\nfootage from yesterday of the day into a\nstream I can't let this ruin this day\nand I have footage on this little camera\nand I gotta shake this off dude that's\ngonna be hard to do but let's shake it\noff after the halfway point of the ride\nwe went through this friggin town dude\nthat was just like it's such a magical\ntown I it's so hard to explain how\nmagical this town is but it is\nthis town is so sick it's such a cute\nlittle town and I keep thinking I'm\ngonna bring I'll bring the wife here\nI'll bring babe here you know you mean\nlike she would love it here dude hurt\nher mom would just spend all day\nshopping and going into every one of\nthese stores but I can't really take her\nall the way over here I keep thinking\nit's close it was really so far away\nthis town is so cool everything in\nfan it's hopeful in everywhere here bro\nlike different doesn't it cylinder\nhow you feeling did good\nhad a nice coke coke me down you had\nso how was that coke from like the\ncoca-cola museum in here I have the best\ncook I've ever had\nreally yeah\nand done stuff great stuff wonderful\nride felt great the entire time like we\nknow when you do 122 miles and you're\nfeeling good and you in feeling good the\nthe it's just so much more rewarding you\nknow I mean because we've all been there\nwork you roll in at 120 miles and you're\njust like I hate cycling I'm gonna throw\nmy bike in a trash can GoPro was\nobviously gone so and in my small camera\nI ran out of juice my phone ran out of\njuice all right positive panda great\nride there's a big date it was a big day\nit was a hot day it was an amazing\namazing day now the end cuz I really\nhadn't eaten any solid food pretty much\nthe whole day so I was super pumped on\nlike the post ride meal did you have\nanything vegan 50ps TPS dude tepee tents\nright so hipster they have beer in a\ncanoe like that's pretty hipster yet\nthere was nothing vegan at all can I ask\nyou a super annoying question is there\nanything in there that's vegan\nyeah I guess the potato salad is potato\nsalad yeah because I mean there's no\nthat's all right Dean so that's like a\nsuper bummer\nI really had expected Rafa to have\nenough hipsters that at least one of\nthem was vegan but it's like it was I\nguess in just that part of the world\nlike people aren't eating plants dude\nit's not a it's not a thing\nso my post meal was lady whack because\nit was nothing so super duper hungry and\nlooking forward to dinner\nit's okay so day three we went on a\nlittle tour of the town and I was guided\nby the town we are riding like rewrote\nour bikes this was probably something\nthat was just I had not expected this\nbut they really went through the town's\nhistory\nwhat Walmart's trying to do for their\ntown it felt very I'll be straight up\nlike cultish like I was being\nbrainwashed or something because after\nthis select who were around their town\nI'm just like a Walmart fanboy okay\nand so maybe I I don't know maybe I\ndrank the kool-aid too much but Doody\nwas nuts man\ndo they have unlimited amounts of money\nand you could do a lot of I mean like\nwhat would you do with unlimited amounts\nof money probably not put it into like\ncleanup water supplies or build\ninfrastructure for cyclists or build\nbusinesses like just make the town\nbetter like it was so nuts dude how much\nmoney they're putting back into the town\nthey have a museum a free museum and\nonly for American artists we got to ride\naround that museum and check it out it's\nfree you know how much money this museum\ncost and then it's free so we're going\nthrough all these different places and I\nactually at one point we were riding and\nthere was all these like burros on\nmountain bikes okay and everything's\nfelt staged like we were being taken\nthrough this very specific route to look\nat everything they wanted us to see\nagain very cultish and so I like break\noff from our little tour and I'm and I\ngo up these guys like what are you what\ndo you do or do you live here what do I\ndid you work for you work for Cindy\nincorporated and send it in\nabsolutely can you give me your thoughts\non like this whole trail system and\nliving here as a local bidonville has\ncome a long way from the last a while\nand it's super red what's happening\naround here I feel like we've got these\nAustin people here that come out now\nthey've got this first time out Angie's\nsecond she read the color in dirt over\nhere last year so it's bringing out a\nlot of people and the Stoke is pretty\npretty high on the trails around here\nand it's just a red spot to be there's\nprobably so much more to the story that\nI'm not telling or not telling right\nbecause I don't remember it I shoulda\nsigh the thing is I need to say these\nstories right after they happen but\nagain I jump on a plane I come home on\nmy wife's birthday I believe or maybe\nwas like the day after so I was just\nlike full gas with her but then\nliterally I have two days to prepare for\nthe Yosemite cycling camp and so it was\nit was like a jam-packed thing and then\nafter camp bike I've just kind of blown\nout and then I just moved on to other\nvideos and this is just something kind\nof stuck in the archive that I'd like to\nto unarchive I should have put it out in\n2018 because it doesn't it's a weird to\nput it out in 2019 when it anyway oh my\ngoodness\nthanks for watching allied cycle works\nbro your gravel bike is phenomenal\nshould send me one I'll definitely ride\nit and yeah man and to the the three\ndudes that I got to spend a weekend with\nthat I'll probably never see again\nI really enjoyed our time together and\nyou're all awesome thanks for watching\nas always being a cyclist you"
