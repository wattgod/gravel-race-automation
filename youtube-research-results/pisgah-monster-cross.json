      "transcript": "Welcome to Pisga Monster Cross. This is\na race in the mountains of North\nCarolina. And\nwe start off under this little gate.\nSierra and I on the left there I just\npassed are doing a few gravel races this\nyear as part of our little off-road\nseason. And already I'm starting off\nquite high here trying to get to the\nfront. I know it starts off see um a\nover there to the right cross superstar.\nUm\nget over here past Alex and Eric. But\nwe're doing a little off-road offseason\nsituation presented by the Black Bibs\nand Team Winston Salem. So, we're\nrocking these\nsalmon, I believe is the official term,\ncolored jerseys from the Black Bibs and\nalso some black bibs from the Black\nBibs. And\nwe're doing a few off-road races. So,\nstarting off here in Pisa Monstercross.\nI actually forgot to get the\nmap routed before the start here. So,\nhad to figure that out while we were on\nthe move. And I guess there's a few\nhundred people in this race, which was\npretty huge, but a lot of these gravel\nroads were pretty chunky. And I had 40\nmm tires on, which is going to be a\ntheme later on. On the road sections, it\nwas great. But when we started off,\nthere was Cypress Cory and Carson\nBeckett. They're with uh full-blown\nmountain bikes, 120 travel mountain\nbikes with mountain bike tires. And that\nwas kind of worrying because they've\ndone these roads and trails many times.\nAnd so I would imagine they were\nadequately prepared starting off up this\nlittle road. It's like a 10 minute, 15\nminute climb. and guys were going pretty\nhard, but I was kind of trying to get to\nthe front so I wouldn't get lost on the\ndescent as far as getting out descended\nby guys on mountain bikes. So,\ngetting as far forward as I possibly\ncan. And\nsee on the right there, I think his\nname's Jack with Felosia Sport. Caught\nup to Thomas Turner there on the left.\nAnd yeah, it's kind of like a double\ntrack, like a an off-road\na uh a jeep trail. I guess a double\ntrack is the best, like a ATV trail. And\nyou have to take some choice lines just\ncuz there's some ruting out happening\nand some deeper gravel over in those\ntracks there. But trying to move up the\nbest I could behind. Got some Lars\nthere. Everybody's got big tires on\ntheir mountain bikes these days. I had\ntalked to Sierra and before the\nhurricane, these roads were a little\nless torn up, but now they are actually\npretty rugged roads. So, hurricane did a\nlot of damage up here in the mountains\nof North Carolina. If you can, I'll put\na little link to somewhere you can\ndonate uh to the hurricane effort. Back\nto the race. I'm attacking\nand\nI'm not sure if this is a great idea or\nnot because it's so early in the race.\nover four miles into a 74 mile race up\nthis hill. I kind of knew what was\ncoming. And there's a few more uphills,\nbut I also knew that on my 40 mil tires\ncompared to guys on mountain bike tires,\nit wasn't going to be great for me. So,\nI wanted to get as much space as\npossible on these downhills just cuz\nthey were going to catch me. And I had\ngood better rolling resistance on a lot\nof spots, especially the road spots. So,\nI'm trying to get away from everybody I\npossibly can. And I am sending this\ndescent quite hard. So,\ntaking some risks that maybe weren't\nsuper necessary for miles into a 70ish\nmile race, but\nI felt like they were kind of necessary.\nIt's pretty chunky road and I kind of\nwanted to see stuff before I hit it. I\nhave a big gear on this bike. Eventually\ngot caught and passed by those mountain\nbikers and I dropped my chain.\nthe big gear, big 50 to ring usually\nkeeps stuff on, but uh this time it was\nbouncing around. I'm not sure if my\nclutch derailer is starting to wear out\nand uh it's bouncing off the chain was\nbouncing off the chain ring too much.\nBut it finishes up the single track\nhere. You can see Stephen there putting\na foot out, having to stop when the guy\nin front of him, I think that's Bob. Oh\nno, it is not. Might be Zeb. The guy in\nI think Bob bobbled or maybe Zeb did.\nand slowed up Stephen and he had to put\na foot out. But now I'm catching back up\nto these two guys. And both Carson and\nCyprus are off the front at this point.\nThey had a much faster descent than\nanybody else. I dropped my chain so I\nthey were gone. Uh but I had that attack\nand it really split up the field. So\nonce that happened and everybody was\nsplit up, kind of going into this\ndescent portion, I\nwas off the backish, had to catch up to\nthese guys before that single track. And\nnow we are descending quite fast. Bob up\nthere is\nshooting this descent pretty hard. I get\npast Seb trying to keep up with Bob, but\nhe's got mountain bike tires on his\ngravel bike and I'm going to do the best\nI can to keep up with him, but he's just\ngoing around these corners like he's got\nmore traction than me, which with tires\nthat are probably 20 mil bigger than\nmine, he's got more traction than me.\nYou're going to see me come around a few\nof these corners and just lose the front\nthere, which was quite worrying many\ntimes. And there's also a bunch of these\nlittle mud sections that on a cross bike\nI'm usually comfortable with, but um\nsome reason with this gravel bike going\n30 miles an hour was not super\ncomfortable. We ended up catching\n&gt;&gt; those two guys at the bottom. I think\nOakley was in front of Bob also and uh\ncaught back up to them and then\neventually I got back on the front\nbecause this road section is perfect for\nmy gear with a 40mm tire. I got back on\nthe front and pushed the pace. caught\nback up to Carson and Cypress here 13\nmiles in. Eventually, it was a bunch of\nus together. So, we've got Oakley there\nright in front of me. He's on fresh\nallied bike. And I figured it was time\nto go. There's a big road climb coming\nup. So, I just attacked them after a\nwhile. I turned my GoPro on and knew I\nhad to wait after that little beep\nbefore attacking. So, I gave it some\ntime and then sent an attack once the\nroad started to kick up a little more.\nNobody really responded, but I just kind\nof maintained a gap. So, I was doing\nlike probably 360 watts on most uphills.\nEventually, Steven tried to catch back\nup on that. Um, but there was a few\ngravel sections he just couldn't keep up\nwith. Eventually, I'm off the front for\na while. And there's this descent here\ncalled Medusa.\nIt had\na wild section. You could probably hear\nme say, \"What is this?\" And on these 40\nmil tires, I was underbiked. Absolutely\nunderbiked. And the guys just on the\nmountain bikes just catch kept catching\nup to me to the point where I would get\nlike a two-minute gap, I think, and then\nthey would just blow through all of it\nonce we got to these more technical\ngravel descents. And even the less\ntechnical gravel descents, I think they\nwere descending way quicker than I was\non those big bikes. So, it was\ndefinitely a uh no one had the right\nbike kind of scenario. On the road\nsections, which there were a decent\namount, I definitely had a good bike for\nit. And then everywhere else the\nmountain bike seemed to be much quicker.\nSo maybe a drop bar mountain bike would\nhave been ideal or like a gravel bike\nwith mountain bike tires. I did this\ndescent as fast as I could though. And\nyou can see I was catching up to I think\nAlex on the moto there. We were having a\nblast at the end of that little Medusa\ndescent. He had like a little bobble and\nlooked back at me and said, \"Man, that\nwas crazy.\" Like, \"Yeah, that is crazy.\"\nAnyway, we're going down this hill super\nhard. I've got many miles left to go,\nbut I just kept 360 on the uphills and\nthen tried to just keep the pace on on\nthe downhills. Eventually on one of the\nlast uphills, you can see we've got it's\na 66 mile race. Five miles to go, I get\ncaught by Oakley. He comes out of\nnowhere. Bridges like a twominute gap\nand he's got this nice allied with the\nlike Ki, it's not the Dub Race Kings, I\nthink is what they used to be called.\nBig old tires on there. I'm trying to\nkeep up with him. But you can see I'm\ndoing like a good bit of power for the\nend of this race. I think I averaged\nlike 300 watts for four and a half, five\nhours. It was a lot of watts. And for\nhim to be catching up to me was pretty\nimpressive. But he just like floats away\nfrom me. I'm not sure if the if it's the\ntires or he was just going that much\nfaster. I started catching back up to\nhim on the downhill. Um really risking\nit here, like sliding around all the\ncorners. Uh but just was not making a\nhuge dent. Eventually I did catch real\nclose up to him and then I just had like\nsome incidents which we're going to see.\nBut I was racing down this downhill just\nas fast as I could go. Like letting it\nslide a little. Yeah, you can see it.\nThere is real chunky downhill. I was\nwilling to risk getting a flat just roll\nit in the best I can. You can see, man,\nthis is like super chunky. These roads\nare awesome. And this whole race was\norganized super well.\nright here. I actually lost the bars.\nUm, and that was very scary. I caught\nmyself with my elbow, which yeah, that\nwas super frightening. And I was like,\nman, I'm I'm going to need to take a\nstep back here in a second. But I kept\ngoing as hard as I could down here. And\nI was catching up to him. I had him in\nsight. I figured, man, if we get to that\nend, I know there are barriers at the\nend. But right here, I went for another\npedal stroke and dropped my chain for\nthe second time. So, just immediately\ntried to get it back on. Come to a stop,\nget that chain back on. I don't think I\nlost a ton of time getting that chain\nback on, but I knew at this point with\ntwo miles to go all downhill, that much\ntime lost was going to be nearly\nimpossible to recoup. So, I just pushed\nin as hard as I could um to the finish\njust in case he also had a similar\nincident, but continued down through\nthat gravel descent and through the\npavement to get second place behind\nOakley. Finished up with bunch of blood\non my arm. Pretty gnarly. But this race\nwas excellently organized. Um the guys\ndid a great job. There were crossing\nguards at everything. Aid stations were\ngreat. barriers at the finish. Very cool\nmonster cross race through the mountains\nof North Carolina. Thanks for watching.\nSee you.\n[Music]"

      "transcript": "So me and Will went down to Bvard and\ndid the Pisgah Monster Cross. And this\nrace is super close to my heart because\nI won the Queen of Pisgga in 2023.\nAnd I actually placed second in this\nthat year because I was pretty sick. I\nhad some mold poisoning going on. So I\nreally wanted to go back and redeem\nmyself. Um, since that time though,\nthere was a pretty bad hurricane that\nwent through the area. So, the course\nwas kind of different. I was really able\nto compare the time when I did the first\nround in 2023. Um, but there was similar\npeople there, which was pretty cool. So,\nlet's get into this.\nAll right. It was also cool. Me and Will\ngot to camp with my parents in Davidson\nCampground. So, that was us going to the\nstart. So, like I said, it's going to\nstart up Joel Branch, which is like the\nopposite direction of Avery. Um, and\nit's also a little bit more of a rough\ngravel section. Um, we pre-road this\nsection the day before, so we kind of\nknew what to expect with how rough it\nwas going to get. Um, I kind of started\nlike further back, so I was amongst\nmore people than I would typically be if\nI like started in the front row, but I\nfigured we're going up this climb. It\nwas going to take like over 20 minutes.\nSo, I didn't want to like gas myself\nright away, especially with how much\nclimbing there was for today.\nUh, so about I don't know how far up,\nbut before you reach the top of this\nfirst climb, you're actually going to go\nup this like super steep switchback\nsingle track. So, I was with two people\nI actually got to see a couple times\nthroughout this race. Um, I met him\nafter the race. He won the 60 plus\ncategory, I think. And then my athlete,\nactually, I coach, Adam. This is him.\nSo, I'm following Adam up the remainder\nof the single track. And this part's\nactually super steep. You can kind of\ntell by how far Adam is leading forward.\nUh\nhad to navigate through some roots right\nthere, which was pretty fun. It's\nactually maybe the highlight of the\ncourse because it's like a mountain bike\nrace.\nYeah. So, I think Adam afterwards he\ntold me he was like hitting threshold up\nthis part. So, we're kind of like\nhitting the top end of where we wanted\nto be for this\n5 hour race day.\nUh let's see. Another switch back. You\ncan see again like how steep it is.\nI think I saved a little bit for that\ntop section. So, I was able to like\ncruise pretty well with Adam's\nthreshold. Um, so yeah. So, we jumped\ndown. The other side was just like\ndownhill immediately. So, you're going\ndown into the fish h the fish hatchery.\nAnd this road is probably\nhad the most like water puddles that\nwould come out of nowhere. So, I think\nWill was like, \"Ah, the cross part of\nthe monster cross.\" So, definitely\naccounted for a good amount of like\nslowdowns that I did. just I don't want\nto get like smacked. Um, so I came to\nthe bottom of that. I think Adam had\ngone ahead and some of the other guys\naround me, they had like pretty thick\ntires and I had either caught them up\nthis like road section. Um, so I'm kind\nof by myself now and just cruising. It\nwas pretty nice day. It wasn't like too\nhot or anything. It was pretty humid\nthough. Um,\noh, and then I caught So this was the\nguy that I saw like I said a few times\nthroughout the race. I caught him going\nup that climb and then he we're with\neach other and like I said he had like\nway bigger tires so he could go down\nthis part like way quicker than I could\nand it was a lot of break bumps which\nyou could kind of see in the beginning\nof that video. I kind of just took it a\nlittle bit more safe\nand here's me catching up to him again.\nSuper nice guy.\nAnd this was the aid stop. So that's\nactually the van that my parents drove.\nand you can't have any outside aid. So,\nthey were just there to they were just\nthere to say hi and my dad was like\ncheering me on. I think he's he's right\nthere. He's so funny.\nHe took that photo of me. Oh, man. I\ndidn't know that was in there. Okay. So,\nyeah. So, you come down through the aid\nstop and then you're on road. I kind of\nsat up for a minute there because I was\nlike smooth service on my little tires.\nSo there's my friend again. We kind of\nwe took I think we rotated twice before\nhitting the climb. And then once we hit\nthe climb, which is the longest climb of\nthis road, he said, \"Hey, I'm going to\nback off and take like a comfortable\npace instead of whatever you're doing\nSierra,\" which was kind of like top end\ntempo up the climb. I really wanted to\nlike take advantage of that climb right\nthere. And then you actually turn off\nthe climb onto this pretty chill gravel\nsection until the end of it.\nSo, it's nice.\nYes.\nSo, I had some Maxis tires on my bike.\nUm, shout out Maxis for supplying me\nanother year. here. I don't know how\nmany years I've been with them, but a\nlong time. Um,\nbut I had a 45 on the front. It was a\nlittle bit more knobbyby, and the one in\nthe back was a 40, but my Gulo wheels\nactually made it a 43. So, we had like a\npretty good setup\nfor a bike um that can't fit more than\n45s. And honestly, like with the amount\nof road on this, which wasn't like a\nlot, but it the road sections are pretty\nI guess like you want to make sure that\nyou can like ride them pretty quick. I\nthink like what I had made that the road\nsections not as like horrific for me.\nSo yeah, this was like the top of the\ngravel kind of. It's kind of punchy I\nguess like after this in this section.\nThere's also a variety of types of\ngravel. So, it was like kind of smooth\nwhen we first started and now you can\nsee it's like getting more chunky. I\nwould say that's like progressively\ngoing to be the story here is it's\ngetting like more and more chunky this\nsection. So, this is kind of the\nbeginning of the chunk.\nOh, it's so pretty there. I love Pisca\nso much.\nYeah, just kind of cruising.\nI actually downed all of my gels, so\nI think I had probably taken already\nlike two and three by this point. Big\ncarbs fuel. There's some puddles.\nThose were kind of like the story of\nthat first road I was telling you about.\nLike there was a ton of those.\nUm,\nnot too bad there\nalone\nthrough this whole section. I don't I\ndon't think I saw anybody actually\nthrough this whole section at all.\nSo,\nand this is going down. So this is kind\nof like where\nthe chunk is reaching its max chunk\nuntil the next road.\nCouple mishaps here. So I definitely was\nhaving a hard time.\nI was for some reason I was like tired.\nObviously, I like spent a month in\nEurope backpack or I spent a month in\nEurope bike packing and I came back and\nI think I was still like trying to\nadjust to society. So, I definitely was\nzoning out a few times and so some of\nthis is kind of me zoning out. You can\ntell.\nYeah. So, there So, between that last\nclip and this clip, there was like a\nroad section which was uphill for the\nmost part. Um, I passed a few people\ncoming into this section. So, there was\na couple of guys kind of around me like\nbehind me and they might have eventually\nlike passed me during this cuz they had\nbigger tires on than I did. Um, and I\nthink they might have known that trail a\nlittle bit better too,\nwhich is super helpful if it's\ntechnical.\nI actually I the road section so I had\npassed them and\nit's probably it's it's best practice to\nlike go through the puddles on the top\nside. So if it's like a slanted mountain\nyou want to be like on the top side,\nright? Cuz the water's draining and I\nzoned out like I was just talking about\nand I was on the wrong side. So, I was\non the left side and I was like, I'll\njust go through this puddle. Like, what\ncould happen? And I'm like, go there's a\neight stop right there. And I was going\nthrough this puddle and I was like all\nof a sudden like just like 2 feet down\ninto this like puddle. And I was just\nlike laughing cuz I was like, \"What?\nWhat was I thinking?\" And the two guys\nlike kind of rode by me and they like\nlooked over at me and I was like\nlaughing and I was like, \"That was a lot\ndeeper than I expected.\" And then they\nwere like they were like, \"Okay, she's\nlike laughing about it.\" So they like\nlaughed with me and they were like,\n\"Yeah, you can't go in those puddles.\"\nAnd I was like, \"Noted.\" There was no\nmore puddles though, so it was kind of\nuseless to know that. Um\nOh, so that was kind of like after you\ncame through that like gravel section,\nit was just downhill. And then we went\nup this like super steep 14% climb.\nThat's like I would say it's like 0.5\nmiles is what I say. And I was kind of\nhanging out with some people that I\ncaught on that climb. And\nthe road after that was like kind of\nchill, like flat, and it brought you\nback through the aid and then back on\nthe gravel. So, this is actually the\ngravel coming back to the end of the\nloop. So, I've already ridden this part\nthe opposite direction and now I'm\nriding down it.\nThis is me coming down the road that I\nwas going up in the beginning of the\nNice section right there.\nI would ride this part all the time when\nI lived in Bvard. And then this is like\nthe long climb out. So,\nin my eyes, this was like kind of just\nas important as that first road climb. I\nreally wanted to make sure I hit this\npretty well. So, I tried to keep in\ntempo, which I think I did a pretty good\njob of, actually.\ncrushing it.\nYeah. So, this is the top. So, you\nclimb, climb, climb, and then you're\nkind of like going false flat. So,\nyou're like on This is obviously like\nnot what I'm about to say, but this is\nlike down and up, but it's like the\noverall thing. What you're doing is\nyou're going up slightly. Um, and this\nis actually the last descent actually.\nSo, this is going down Avery. So, I've\nalready like gone up up up and now I'm\ncoming down.\nSo yeah, this is me coming to the finish\nline, which is super exciting\ncuz I didn't see any women, so I assume\nthere's no one in front of me. And I was\nalso told by some people that I was in\nthe lead. So this is me finishing.\n&gt;&gt; That was pretty cool."
