      "description": "#biggravelmiles #keepcrushingit\nI had heard from so many people how great this race was so I knew I had to do it.  It did not disappoint!  The communication prior to the race was outstanding, the support during the race was top shelf and the course was absolutely gorgeous.  If you love gravel, this is a race you need on your calendar.  Oh, and don't eat like I did before a race like this!\n\nStrava link to my race: https://www.strava.com/activities/5944681744",

man\nman\n75 for me so can't wait to get back\nbefore the heat\nguys i'm riding with todd right now this\nman is on a single speed\nand\nhe weighs\n250 pounds and you ate how much win 315\nback in march\nthe dude's doing 120 miles on a freaking\nsingle speed\nbobby\nwhat's up man\nwhen are we going to see you back on the\npod with neil and matt\nprobably\nwhen they asked me to get this man back\non the pod if you guys don't watch\ngravel guber go subscribe\nthey do some cool stuff and have some\ngreat conversations\ni was just hoping you picked a good line\ndamn\nsee this right now\nso this is the pony express gravel dash\nand i don't know all the history exactly\nbut basically in the 1800s\nthey would use horses\nto deliver mail across the country\ni think some of these roads\nparts of this area\nwere along the route\nso that's how the race got its name\nbut this is pretty cool right now these\nare definitely\nb roads\nor farm roads or whatever you want to\ncall them\napparently this is the first really big\nhill coming up right here it's called\nbursky hill sponsored by the wagon wheel\n[Applause]\nand then when you get to the top of the\nclimb there's a guy who gave me a little\nticket it said brewsky hill good for one\nfree beer\nhow cool is that\nokay i'm at mile 71\ni believe there's another rest stop at\nlike mile 74 or 75\nand i'm really regretting eating those\ndonuts right now i don't know why i did\nthat\ni usually eat like oatmeal\nor something light\nbefore a race like this\nif if i don't find a toilet\nat this rest stop\ni'm going to be taking a in one of\nthese corn fields\nand i'm not even kidding all right lady\nsaid follow the orange flags\nshe said there is a restroom here\nthank god\nso i'm following the orange flags right\nnow he's trying to find the\nyes\noh i'm so happy to see you 11 minutes\nlater\nwhoa do not go in there\nwe're going in the cornfield one\neternity later\nyeah so uh that just happened right here\num\nhopefully that's the last of it but\ni don't know what's jacking up my\nstomach uh but it's it's not good\num probably those donuts but\ni'm not gonna show you guys which is\nwhat just happened here i'll spare you\nof that but just so you know if you're\never in a cornfield you gotta take a\nthe\nleaves\nthe the leaves that grow in the corn\nit's not cheapy but i mean it does a\npretty damn good job it's like kind of\nsoft once you get\nin there\nby the corn it's kind of soft and it you\nknow gives you a good it's kind of\nspread out so you don't get poo on your\nfingers it it works\nall right let's finish this ride\ngotta cash in that free beer ticket\nall right guys thanks for checking out\nthe video\n119.19 miles\na moving time of seven hours 57 minutes\nand 13 seconds i do not know\nmy total course time\nthere were those restroom breaks and\nthose took some time\nbut um i think it was probably around\n8 hours and 30 minutes total course time\nuh average speed of 15\nand that's my moving time obviously from\nwhat i can see on strava uh\n3943 feet of elevation and a lot of\ncalories burned so before you guys\ncomment and call me an idiot for eating\nwhat i ate this morning for breakfast\nmy stomach issues were due to my poor\nfood choices lesson learned basically i\nwoke up at 2 a.m by the time i got to\ncasey's it was like 5 30 and i was\nabsolutely starving so i wanted to eat\neverything in the store but lesson\nlearned that was really stupid but\noverall this was an absolutely awesome\nevent\nreally cool downtown area they give you\nfree beer afterwards the signage i'm\npretty sure every turn on this course\nhad a sign\nuh just really great course great views\ngreat support along the route so i'll\ndefinitely be back to this one but guys\nuntil next time keep crushing it\nbye"
