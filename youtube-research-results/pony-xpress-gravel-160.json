      "description": "2021 Pony Xpress 85k on May 8, 2021, hosted just outside Trinidad, CO in the small town of Cokedale. Personally, this was the first competitive anything I've done in close to 5 years, and after 11 months off the bike last year I was happy to finish in under 3:30 (3:12:55!). I made up a lot of time on the descents, got crushed on the climbs (usual story). Incredible scenery, mining ruins, beautiful gravel made for an incredible day. COS Racing had a successful day out, taking the entire men's podium in the 85k and 1st on the women's podium.\n\nRidden on a 2021 Giant Revolt Advanced 0 with Teravail Cannonball 42s.",
