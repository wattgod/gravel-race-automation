      "description": "This is a breakdown of how the racing went for me on June 10th at Southeast Gravel's Race to Valhalla out of Walhalla, SC. I had a really good day despite the heat and strong competition and managed to ride myself into 4th place overall. For me this is a bit of a \"breakthrough\" event, considering the talent expected to be present I didn't think a podium place was realistic. Feels really good to prove myself wrong!\n\n\nThanks to https://supercycling.zenfolio.com/ for providing photographs from the event (like my thumbnail.) and of course https://southeastgravel.com/ for putting the event on!\n\n\nI think after this event I'll be in 3rd overall for the series, the next race is on September 4th. Definitely recommend folks checking it out if they're interested in gravel racing and riding. \n\n\nYou can find me on Strava at: https://www.strava.com/athletes/377840\nOr on Instagram at: https://www.instagram.com/zebulonr/\n\n\nI ride for the Sycamore Cycles Collective: https://www.sycamorecycles.com/",

      "transcript": "hello and welcome to the\nfourth southeast gravel race in walhalla\nsouth carolina uh this was a really cool\nrace\nand i'm really glad that i made it down\nto do it this video is gonna be a little\nbit different and that\nuh i didn't get a lot of footage of too\nmany moments in the race\nreally just the one climb and then a\nlittle bit after that\nso that's really what i'm gonna dive\ninto and that's gonna be a bulk of this\nvideo\nin terms of race footage but first\nthis is the start and so this is the\nride data\nfrom this event and looking at this data\nyou can see that\nthe race was just under 70 miles\ntook me about three hours and 46 minutes\nand that was the the bulk of the riding\nand you can see that i had a normalized\npower of 268 watts\nand an average of 221. my max\npower there is definitely false that\ndefinitely\nis a stages error i wish i could put out\nthat much power\nbut i can't and so that's kind of\nreally how this race uh went was the\ndata that you're seeing on the screen\nright here\nand i do break this race down into kind\nof three\npivotal moments over the course of the\nevent and so we'll go through those\nstarting with this one right here this\nis the winding stair climb which is the\npart of the race i was most excited\nabout\nit is roughly four miles and it took\na little over 20 minutes to complete and\ni was really excited for a climb because\ni love\nlong climbs i i'm not really a climber\nnecessarily but i just really enjoy\nclimbing and i knew that this was really\ngoing to be the moment that\nbroke up this race and the winners would\nkind of rise to the top\nand so on screen now you can see my data\nfrom the climb\nand you'll see that i averaged\n319 watts with a normalized 326\ni paced myself i think really well here\non this climb\ni knew that i didn't want to blow up and\nthat i\nwanted to just ride at my own pace in\nthe past i found that i tend to try\nand stick with the leaders but this time\ni was more realistic\ni know that i'm not as strong as the\nguys like dylan johnson\nand folks like that but i knew that i\nthink that i can climb pretty well\nso i figured if i just ride at my own\npace over the course of this climb\nhopefully i'll end up in a group kind of\nfighting it out for\na place on the podium and that is\nessentially what happened\nso you can see we make a left across\nthis bridge right here and this is kind\nof really where the action\nkicked off um the power kind of\nimmediately\nwent up and people really started to try\nand\nbreak it up and at this point i've kind\nof\nmoved myself towards the front of the\nrace here on this climb\nunfortunately this guy i think his name\nwas barry on the right right there you\ncan see him swing out and he just rode\naway\nand by all accounts from talking to\npeople after the race\nhis speed on the climb was pretty\nridiculous\nand i'm really glad i didn't stick with\nit here i was monitoring my power\ni was looking at my heart rate i knew if\ni went any deeper\nchances are i wouldn't be able to\nrecover well so\ni tried to settle in and i let that\ngroup go\ni'm really glad that that's the decision\ni made because here i\nam eventually on my own and by this\npoint i\nhave caught and passed a lot of those\npeople that you saw riding away from me\nand i've slowly been picking off people\nwhile i was going up this climb\nuh which was a really good feeling\nthere's a group right there just in\nfront of me that you can see that i'm\nriding towards and then here i've\nkind of made it into this little elite\ngroup i was really happy to see this\nthis is eric thompson just in front of\nme\nhe races cyclocross he's a really strong\nrider and so when i caught him\ni kind of knew i was towards the head of\nthe race and i\nsettled in even more just to stick with\nhim and kind of ride on his wheel\nand then ultimately we rode together\nreally well\nand this is us reaching the top of the\nclimb just in front of us there\nis tyler miranda again a really strong\nrider\nand so i was really excited when we saw\nhim because i was like oh well you know\nthis is\nthis is kind of it this is the head of\nthe race and so this was really the\nfirst\nbig moment of this event was\nright here this was winding stair climb\nso i'm throwing this clip in here to\nkind of set the scene for what was going\non\nso just in front of us right there you\ncan actually see eric thompson\nkind of riding away from us this is kind\nof how it went it was us\nyo-yoing off the back of him at this\npoint we're still in this little group\nof four\nand we're on the next section of gravel\nand it was pretty sawtoothy um\nreally jagged kind of punchy and eric\nwas crushing it on the descents and he\nkept opening up gaps\nand eventually we couldn't hold onto his\nwheel anymore\nand he ended up getting away from us and\nthat\nis what happened on this stretch of road\nthankfully we\ncaught a guy from the lead group so they\nkind of traded places\neric ended up in the lead group one guy\ngot dropped and so we were still in a\ngroup of four\nand that's kind of how we rolled around\nthe course for\nquite a while we knew that there were\nyou know three people up the road so we\nwere racing for fourth\nand that's kind of how a lot of the race\nwent\num and then this kind of leads in to\nthis next pivotal moment which i'm going\nto throw up on screen now\nso by this point in the race we were\nstill in a group\nbut at this point it was just three\nbecause we actually stopped at a rest\nstop\nand a big group had caught us and i\nthankfully had just finished filling in\nmy bottle\nand so as soon as that group was rolling\ninto the rest stop i took off\nand a couple people came with me and\nhere on this climb here\ni ended up dropping those two folks\nand i really i didn't know anything\nabout this climb i didn't know how long\nit was\num i didn't even know it was coming and\nso it was a little unexpected\nbut i hit this climb and i just rode a\ngood effort uh dropped the people i was\nwith\nand ended up going solo for\nquite a while um i think that eventually\ni got caught with about 15 miles to go\nbut this is the effort that it took to\ngo solo uh just under 300 watts it was\nonly a seven minute climb\na little under a mile and so that's this\neffort right here\nso once i was solo i kind of really\nwanted to keep it that way i started to\nkind of\nthink about you know how cool it would\nbe to roll in on my own\num in fourth place i was pretty\ncommitted to not getting caught\nso i tried to ride at a good pace and\nfor a long time\ni kind of was just out there on my own\nbut eventually i did notice that i was\nstarting to see a group pretty far back\nbehind me\nand so i got into the mindset of okay\nwell the catch is probably gonna happen\ni need to sit up start resting and\nwait to get caught and brought back\nand i'm really glad i did because\ninevitably when the catch happened\nit was a big group um tinker was there\nalong with bobby julek\nuh thomas turner and another former pro\nnamed barry\nand so they caught me and thankfully i\nhad sat up early enough and rested\nenough that i\nstill had some gas left in the tank and\ni was\nable to kind of stick with them and then\nthat's kind of how the race went i think\nthey caught me with about 15 miles to go\nand i knew that i just had to stick with\nthem\nit was super painful um very often\ni thought that i was gonna crack i\nfigured that i was gonna blow up\nand i knew that it was just a game of\nsurvival\nwhich leads to the final big moment of\nthe race\nwhich is going to be right here i'll\nthrow that data on the screen and\nthere's the\nfinal attack that i put in i had the\nroute\non my wahoo and so i saw the finish line\ncoming up\nand then also the finish was at a school\ni saw the school school zone sign\nand i knew that if i was gonna do it it\nhad to be now\nand so i put in a pretty big attack\nand that's the data you see here i\naveraged 347 watts\nfor just a minute 19 which is not that\nhigh but you can see my max and i\nactually think that's\nprobably pretty close to being accurate\num\ni just attacked really hard and held\nthat power for not long not the max but\ni held a high power for a little bit\ngot a pretty big gap i ended up\nfinishing seven seconds in front of them\num so i finished fourth uh tinker came\nin fifth and then i'm not really sure\nthe shakeout\npast that but that's how the race went\ni was really thrilled because it was\nreally exciting to kind of\nlook around like 10 miles from the\nfinish line and see\nwho i was in a group with it was kind of\nmind-blowing i was actually\njust kind of kept having that impostor\nsyndrome kind of thing like\ni certainly shouldn't be in that group\nand i couldn't believe that i was there\num but yeah it was it was a really good\nrace and i'm really\nyou know honestly proud of myself for\nhow i ended up racing it\nuh it felt like it was a really\ngood event for me i'd kind of been\nstarting to not believe my power meter\nleading into this you know tempo and\nsteady state\nwe're starting to feel kind of easy and\ni felt like my falling creek podium\nwas a bit of luck and so it's kind of\nnice to come out here to this event and\nreally just kind of\nput it all out there and get a good\nresult and kind of back up\nall the training i've been doing"
