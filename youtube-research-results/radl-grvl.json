      "transcript": "I'm not here to make up the numbers I'm\nhere to race and I'm setting out to win\nyeah I'm going to regret saying that\naren't\n[Music]\n[Applause]\nI so I mean Adam laid South Australia\nfor rattle gravel we got 108 km over\n2,000 M of elevation we got gravel\ntracks we've got big climbs we've got\nRoad sections and we're going to have\nsome wild\nracing so this is the first ever edition\nof rattle gravel and it's held in\nassociation with the tour down under\nwhich is the world tour season opening\nrace now there are two different race\ndistances to choose from here the\nslightly longer 108 km version which I'm\ndoing in the Pro category and then\nthere's also the slightly shorter 70 km\nversion now both routes head out from\nMcLaren Vil going east and start with an\nabsolute brute of a climb before the\ndifferent routes split now this is going\nto be one hell of a race but before I\ncan even start thinking about that I\nneed to go sign in and collect my number\nboard okay with are about 50 minutes out\nfrom the start of the event now I've\ncollected my number board I've got the\ngels taped on the top of my bike to make\nsure I'm fueled correctly I'm loading\nthe route up onto my head unit other\nthan that it's pretty much like all\nsystems go I'm pretty much kitted up\nit's getting super busy the sun's coming\nup it's starting to look absolutely\nbeautiful cuz until the sun made an\nappearance it was actually kind of cold\nhere I'm excited for race day it feels\nlike it's starting to get a little bit\nserious now and the nerves are starting\nto kick in especially seeing as I've\nsaid I'm trying to race this thing we're\ngoing out to do\nwell why do I put this pressure on\n[Laughter]\nmyself okay starting to get busy now\nlike everyone's getting ready to line up\nand starting to Edge forwards more and\nmore I think cuz everyone's panicked\nabout how massive The Climb is at the\nstart no one wants to start too far back\nso I better pay attention make sure I\ncan see the front and then this game on\nsee you in a\nbit 4 3 2 one let's go\ngravel the buzzer went to start the\nwhole whole thing off I think I was\nprobably close to around the e8th or\nninth row it was it was like full\nsystems go and all of a sudden I found\nmyself right on the right hand side of\nthe road and I just managed to squeeze\nand dart all out the side to get past\neverybody and just coming into the base\nof the starting climb I actually\nactually made it right to the start of\nthe race it was so and cool and then all\nof a sudden it it just Dawns and you\nlook up and there's this absolute just\nwall in front of you and you're like oh\nmy God I've got to ride up that and I'm\nalready like close to my\nlimit the start of the race was\neffectively 20 minutes as hard as you\ncould possibly ride I kind of made it to\nthe top of the climb with the front of\nthe race in sight but I was kind of like\nthat second tier level of riders back\nmaybe in and out of the top 10 all of a\nsudden I was like I can't sustain this I\nfound myself in a group of probably 15\nRiders which is pretty big but it was 15\nRiders 14 bikes two people were on a\ntandem\nbut all of a sudden I found myself like\non some guy's wheel and he was\nabsolutely drilling it and all of a\nsudden I'm just hanging on as much as I\npossibly can and it's got harder and\nharder and harder and harder I glanced\nover my shoulder thinking I need to pull\nout of the line here to let somebody\nelse in because I'm going to get dropped\nand I glanced over nobody behind me so I\nwas like well I've only got one option\nhere just to grip my teeth and hang on\nbut I'm glad I did because it towed us\nall the way up to the next Group which I\nthink was almost like the second group\nout on the like race at the time in my\nhead I was thinking this is a great\nplace to be it's okay I'm racing I've\nrecovered a little bit now I'm not quite\nin the thick of the action but we're\npretty much at the sharp end of the race\nlike I feel like I'm doing myself proud\nbut also suffering for\nit\nthrough the middle section of the race\nis probably where it was most undulating\nlots of changes of Direction small\nlittle kickers which to start with all\nseemed fine and dandy but after you've\ndone a few of those you're getting out\nof the saddle trying to put your effort\nin as best as possible and you can just\nfeel like the fatigue and ache in the\nmuscles of your legs and all of a sudden\nyou can feel that like effort level\ncreeping up on you and the fatigue is\nstand to set in and you're like you look\nthrough on your head you anything right\nI've got 50 60 C to go only just the\nhalfway mark I'm thinking are we going\nto make it to the end are we going to be\nin the front group I don't know but it's\na case of sitting tight and just\nthinking right I've got to like trust\nthe process here I know what's coming up\nI can see the elevation eat drink fuel\nmyself up recover when I can and really\njust keep keep chipping away and Ticking\nalong at\nto achieve 2,000 M of elevation in that\ndistance you've got to have some pretty\nbig climbs and in the back half of the\nrace there was probably two significant\nclimbs one of them I got over absolutely\nfine in our group the second one I was\njust hanging and hanging on until I\ncould just see myself sliding to drift\noff of the back of our little group of\nfour or five of us it was moments like\nthat it kind of me back to the days of\nracing when you're really having to like\ngrit your teeth and think come on I can\ndo this I can do this I can do this the\nguys are like just up in the distance\ncome on I've got to make it back on here\nI've got to I've got to do it I got to\ndo myself proud thankfully I did which\nwas a real good like achievement within\nthe race nowat sh\nJoker holy Mir sing songs in the rain w\nahe walk\nin as we're approaching the last 20 km\nof the race it's kind of like a\nsignificant change not only in the\nterrain but also the surfaces that\nyou're riding on all of a sudden it's\nreally hard packed gravel super wide\nflat fast lots of sections and turns\nonto roads and the 20K last 20K\nliterally like went just like that LOL\nand I you're seeing the 20K sign to go\n10K sign to go and you think how how is\nthis ticking along and you look down\nyour head unit and you think they wonder\nthe kilometers ticking off so fast we're\ndoing like 55 km an hour on gravel which\nis absolutely\ninsane we're coming into the Finish Line\nthe barriers are coming up at the the\nside you glance up you can see the\nFinish Line Gantry there's just three of\nus coming into the finish and I'm\nthinking right this is my only\nopportunity here to move up two\npositions at most I can't change\nanything else now there's one guy behind\nwe've just\ndropped I've just got to give it my\nold\nI got the saddle I tried to Sprint\nthere's just nothing left so I roll into\nthe Finish Line oh\nboy that's one of the toughest things\nI've done for a long time so I have\nliterally no idea where I finished one\nthing that I do know for\nsure uh if we rewind back to start I\nthink we can roll out the win\nwhatever okay right reassess the\nsituation I actually think I finished in\nwhat was the third group right bloody\nawful 3 hours 16 minutes I reckon we\nwere like 12 minutes behind the\nleaders let's grab a cold drink sit down\nactually sum up what the hell actually\nhappens disappointed at the moment but\nas I say sat here now thinking I\ncouldn't have done anything more that\nwas the that was physically all my body\nhad to give had an absolute smashing\ntime doing it 17th Place I think I can\nhold my head high sat now these guys are\nsome of the best gravel racers in the\nworld and when you're out there trying\nto mix it with them is where it's when\nyou really know it and you realize that\nthe top guys are really like at another\nlevel and it's kind of insane to be\namongst that I kind of I feel like I've\ndone myself proud today just being in\nthat situation\nthe goal I set out to come here was not\nto make make up the numbers to get stuck\ninto the race and I said of course\neveryone comes here wants to race and\nwants to win it was always an ambitious\ngoal and it's a risky move saying that\nyou want to win something because really\nyou're half setting yourself up to fail\nthere's only one outcome then if it all\ngoes perfectly it's a success anything\nother than that feels like a failure\nbut here now I don't feel like I failed\nat all at this thing it's it feels like\na huge success to me to come here and\nrace and feel like I rolled back five\nyears when I was still racing as a pro\nit's like a really cool like exciting\nthing to do I feel kind of honored to be\nable to come here and go through that\nprocess and experience such a cool event\nand do that with so many like-minded\npeople that are just some people are set\nout to race some people are set out to\nhave fun some people's goal is to win\nsome people's goal is to literally just\nfinish be that the longer route or the\nshorter route and that's\nprobably well I mean that's just a\nspirit of gravel isn't it like what more\ncan you\nsay"

onto the first section of\ngravel there is quite a decent amount of\ngravel on this course and here we go\nserious climbing\nbegins you better be warmed up pretty\nwell this climb is an mfer\nthe Garment is reading\n19% the good news is 16% feels easy\nversus\n177% or\n19% almost a k to the summit still some\nclimbing left but amazing views if you\ncare to look over your right shoulder\nSummit cred it's a good thing I don't\npartake in driver because that would not\nhave been a very rapid time I'm already\nglowing with perspiration here if you\nhave time to look about the place there\nis some stunning scenery either side of\nthe\nroad interesting part of the course\nhere if you have the cross skills you\ncan hop that maybe I'm not going to do\nthat another barrier you'll have to hop\nover a short section of bitchman then a\nright hand turn to another climb rot\nroll climb number two is a bit of a\nbugger as\nwell if you can can manage it look at\nthe view\nbehind here on climb number two of many\n14% near the summit got a passenger here\nat they mate cred climb number to a\nlittle while\nago hey folks here we are with uh these\nboys are from the Netherlands

designed the rattle gravel\ncourse did an absolutely spectacular job\non to climb number\nfour on the left side of the road here\nPony poo help yourself onto Mount\nmagnificent\nRoad and that's likely Mount\nmagnificent this climb is likely to be a\nwar\nwhen you see the car steep grade sign\nrot roll we're almost over the worst of\nthis\nclimb about a mile or 1.6 C to the\ntop back onto gravel must stop for a\nmoment to admire this beautiful\nview\nas Lads are riding a bit too\nfast for my liking or abilities welcome\nback to a normal scheduled programming\nhere I almost\ncompleted the long
