      "description": "Hi there! Feel free to drop us a text if you enjoy the episode. (https://www.buzzsprout.com/twilio/text_messages/2303813/open_sms) \n\n\nIn this episode we had the pleasure of sitting down with Mat Rousseu and Alex Land, the passionate co-founders of Gravel Boston (https://gravelboston.square.site/) . This dynamic duo has been instrumental in promoting gravel rides in the Boston area, aiming to create an inclusive cycling community that caters to both seasoned riders and beginners.\n\nMat and Alex shared their journey of founding Gravel Boston, highlighting their mission to make gravel riding accessible and enjoyable for everyone. They discussed the unique appeal of gravel riding, from the sense of adventure it offers to the camaraderie it fosters among riders.\n\nGravel Boston operates out of Cycle Loft, a well-known bike shop in the Boston area that has become a hub for local cyclists. We delved into the logistics of their rides, which are planned to ensure a safe and exciting experience for all participants.\u00a0 One their weekly rides occur on Sundays at 9am from Cycle Loft. Whether you're a veteran cyclist looking for a new challenge or a newcomer eager to explore the world of gravel riding, Gravel Boston has something for you. Their rides can be found by joining their STRAVA CLUB, (https://www.strava.com/clubs/1039214?utm_source=android_share&utm_medium=social&share_sig=XWR16EK81718041526&_branch_match_id=1300461708666851741&_branch_referrer=H4sIAAAAAAAAA8soKSkottLXLy4pSixL1EssKNDLyczL1vd2SSwJ9s0Lz%2FJOAgD3u%2FUtIwAAAA%3D%3D)  and there are no membership fees!\n\nAdditionally, the episode spotlighted some hidden gem events in New England that every gravel enthusiast should know about. Mat and Alex gave us the inside scoop on events like Rasputitsa, known for its challenging yet rewarding course; Raid Rockingham, which offers picturesque routes through New Hampshire; B2VT, a grueling ride from Bedford to Vermont; and VTMonster, a test of endurance in the stunning landscapes of Vermont.\n\nWe also touched on the world of electric gravel bikes. Mat and Alex shared their thoughts on how these e-bikes are making gravel riding more accessible to a broader audience, allowing riders of different fitness levels to enjoy longer and more challenging routes.\n\nThe conversation naturally flowed into a comparison between gravel riding and mixed terrain riding, exploring the unique challenges and pleasures each type offers and what the Boston area has to offer.\u00a0\n\nA highlight of the episode was Alex's recounting of his adventure at the 2024 Unbound XL, a grueling 350-mile gravel race in Kansas.\u00a0\n\nTune in to hear more about the vibrant gravel riding community in Boston, get tips on how to get started, and learn about upcoming events that should definitely be on your radar. Whether you're looking to push your limits or simply enjoy a scenic ride, this episode will get you excited to ride on some dirt!\u00a0\n\n\nThis podcast embarks on a journey to showcase and celebrate the endurance sports community in New England.",

      "transcript": "Welcome to the New England endurance\npodcast where we celebrate the thriving\nEndurance Sports scene in New England\nI'm your host art trotes and today we're\ntalking about gravel cycling in New\nEngland and particularly in the Boston\narea and I'm today I'm joined by the\nco-founders of gravel Boston an\norganization DED dedicated to hosting\ngravel rides around the Boston area for\nall levels of riders and today we have\nAlex L director of operations and a man\nwho just finished Unbound XL 2024 a 350\nmile gravel race in Kansas and then we\nhave Matt Russo the Visionary behind\ngravel Boston what's up jent welcome to\nthe podcast thanks for having us it's\ngreat to have you I'm excited to talk\nabout gravel get the story out there um\nbut first off I have to clear the air on\na couple of things so gravel Boston is\ndifferent from Boston gravel which is\nanother Cycling group on Instagram and\nalso Boston cross which is a cycl cross\nteam from the early\n2000s and also different from Boston\nsand and gravel which is a supplier of\nall things concrete yes we Supply no\nconcrete so Matt tell us about gravel\nBoston and why you guys started it like\nwhat's the vision here yeah so there was\na couple of us um that were working at\nthe psych Loft uh and there became a\nneed for a Sunday group ride and uh\ngravel bikes were getting popular but\nnot necessarily commonplace like they\nare today um so it was basically an\nexcuse to get out on a Sunday morning\nand we started riding at the uh Bedford\nDepot and we'd get you know 5 10 guys\nyou know it start like that and then um\nAlex started joining because of he was\nwe were riding together lot um and then\nit just sort of evolved and evolved and\nI said one day I said I wonder if gravel\nboston.com is available and it is so I\nregistered it for $112.99 like God daddy\num and that's it we started the straa\ngroup and it's literally snowballed\nsince and when was this um\n2008 yeah somewhere oh wow okay so pre\npandemic it was yeah well we started\nriding during the pandemic actually cuz\nnobody was um and uh it was a small\ngroup it was only a couple of us um and\nthen coming out of it was when we\nstarted getting kind of serious about\nthe the group excellent Alex so what's\nthe message you guys are trying to\nspread here and how are you building\ncommunity in New England I think that\nanybody can ride gravel it's a inclusive\nsport we're kind of accept all Riders at\ndifferent skill levels and we try and\nwork together to make everybody have a\ngood time together we're a social\norganiz organization not a race\norganization oh I like that so how does\nsomeone get involved with gravel Boston\nsimple we just we asked that you just\nregister on straa just go into the\ngroups and just join gravel Boston uh\nand then some interaction you know we\ndon't just ask that you just join and\nkind of sit in the cut um and which a\nlot of people do and we we get that\nbecause of Life schedules children\nfamilies all these things that you know\nprohibit people from just getting out\nevery single Sunday uh but the best part\nis when they do show up you know and\nI've and I say to myself man that guy's\nbeen a he or she's been a member for for\na long time now I've always wondered\nabout so and so and here they are\nshaking my hand it's really cool you\nknow do you guys distinguish between\ngravel riding and mixed terrain riding I\nthink one is one in then of another\nright because you could vary it right\nyou could say okay we did 50% gravel and\n50% road today or whatever it was mixed\nright so I mean well so I I sort of kind\nof think that mixed terrain has to do\nwith um you know little bit more rocks\nand Roots like the traditional gravel\nwhen I think about that is sort of the\nVermont classic gravel this sort of\nsmooth dirt road but around here around\nthe Boston area I feel like it's a lot\nmore of the mixed terrain sure yeah we\ndo a lot of single track a lot of rocks\nand roots and kind of accept what we\nhave and make it into gravel yeah you\nhave to accept what you have cuz we're\nin the Boston area and I don't think\nmany folks know that there are all these\nlittle hidden nuggets of trails and this\ntrail system like the Lexington Greenway\num you know like what's the what's your\nbread and butter sort of loop what are\nwhat are some of the names of some of\nthese you know uh trails that you're\nriding on uh we go through uh battle\nRoad in minam man National Park a lot\nthe uh Reformatory branch and the Narrow\nGauge and Bedford those are both gravel\nrail Trails it's a good option um we do\na lot in conquered like estherbrook\nwoods and Great Brook Farm and Carlile\nand uh there's kind of bits and pieces\nthat you can put together turn single\ntrack into a gravel ride\nyes I've been on all those and you're\nright some of it's a mix of gravel some\nof it's that more gnarly single track\nbut not too gnarly where you need a\nmountain bike you just need to maybe go\nover those areas a little more\ncautiously um do you guys run an event\nor is there sort of one standout event\nthat you guys do each year that you want\npeople to show up on I know I I went to\nan event that seemed like it was bigger\nthan normal maybe 30 or 40 Riders but is\nthere one that's on your calendar that\nwe should get on our calendar the Sunday\nrides show first Sunday it's just a good\nsocial time we do some what time is that\nwhere does it happen and what's the\ndistance depart 9:00 a.m. from the cycle\noff in Burlington we do somewhere\nbetween 15 and 25 miles up to maybe 2\nhours a little bit more depending on\nconditions and who shows up and what we\nwant to do for that day so we can just\nshow up at cyof there's no membership\nfee Nothing free to run it's free it's\nfree we will never charge people to ride\nwith us so how do you guys make sure\nthat you know you're you're being\ninclusive it sounds like number one no\ncost number two just show up like how\nare you ensuring the inclusivity part of\nit if someone's like super new to gravel\nor dirt riding it's it's challenging we\nhave to um make some efforts right so\nsome of these people need to be uh\none-on-one right you want to make sure\nthat they feel welcome and you want to\nmake sure that you identify who they are\nand maybe even some of their abilities\num so one of you guys will hang back and\nI try to do more of that Alex is\nobviously a lot faster and usually kind\nof leads the fast group and sort of\nkeeps everybody like in check y um and\nthen we usually have me or Anthony that\nwill sweep right and kind of keep things\nand who's Anthony for the listen psoft\nyeah Anthony's a long time Anthony\nlascaris is a longtime psychoff uh\nco-owner manager whatever uh and has\nalmost 50 years of cycling experience\nhe's just a legend awesome I do know\nAnthony H and he is a Legend um how do\nyou guys ensure safety and preparedness\nfor the Riders on your group rides yeah\nsafety is up to each and his each person\non their own right we just ask that the\nguys in the back are watching their\nwheels and being within their limits um\nand then the guys in the front are\ntrying to keep their eye on the guy in\nthe back right it's it's kind of a\nbrotherly whatever sisterly we just need\nto be um all riding as one but we need\nto keep you know groups of about 10 or\nso and then we need to make sure that\nthose groups are matched fairly well\nwell you know ability wise um so you\nmight break up the group if there's 30\npeople at show up you might have groups\nof 10 or 12 perhaps yeah we try to do\nthat yeah okay how do folks find out we\nwe mentioned 9:00 at cycle Loft on\nSundays are other Roger during during\nthe course of the week and how would we\nfind out is it just joining the straa\nclub is it also the Instagram page yeah\nboth both so um Alex puts together\ntypically one Saturday Adventure right a\nmonth I believe that was one of the ones\nthat you came on yes um and those are\nusually themed right we try to do the\ncider donut ride in the fall we I love\ndonuts right we do a uh we do a coffee\nride I'm super proud of the coffee ride\nwe make coffees in the woods what yep we\ndon't go get them at a coffee shop we\nbring the stove we bring the beans we\ngrind them we oh that's Co it's so fun\nthat's awesome and it was raining last\nyear and it just made it all that much\nmore fun okay so if I wanted to find out\nabout that ride then I would go to the\ngravel bosson Instagram page we would\nmention it there but also on straa we\nput that ride on the mon on the monthly\nuh calendar and what's the name of your\nStrava group it's gravel Boston gravel\nBoston all right yeah we have about\nalmost 800 uh members now um and again\nthat's some people who may have never\nridden with us and that's some people\nwho show up every weekend oh nice so\nit's pretty cool do you have any\nCommunity\nPartners aside from the psycho Loft um\nyou know not really I mean we've tried\nto do some things with nemba we do a lot\nof Trail maintenance and stuff around\nthe places where we do ride especially\nuh landlock forest and stuff like that\nwhen it gets a little messy um but not\nas many as we'd hope for so I am\nfamiliar with landlock Forest um to me\nthat sounds like or or to me it feels\nlike a mountain bike area are there sort\nof mixed training gravel um trails in\nthere the same ones that you would be\ndoing on your mountain bike okay yeah\nnot too techy though um it can be Alex\ndoes a lot better at it than I do I'm\ngetting better at it but um I don't\ncrash as much as I nearly used to oh boy\num what's the long-term vision for\ngravel Boston what do you see you know\ntwo or three or four years out what are\nyou hoping to accomplish um just more\nCommunity growth you know we've got so\nmany great clubs um around the area\nBoston's such a cycling Rich um neck of\nthe woods we've got the Rippers we've\ngot keep it tight cycling we've got the\nmonsters I mean I ride with the monsters\nI I pay the crw to ride with them um I\nlove all these clubs I think they're\ngreat clubs they include great people\nand you know not to say I go poaching\nother Riders but I just love to grab\npeople who fit the mold of what we're\ntrying to accomplish and what we do\nbecause it just works so many cool\npeople have come from these other I do\nfeel like there's a lot of\ncross-pollination in the Boston area\nlike I'm you know I'm the founder of\nkeep it tight but I do a lot of riding\nwith the Rippers I've ridden with the\nmonsters I've ridden with you guys like\nthere's you know and I love that about\nthe community here that's part of the\nreason why we started the podcast is\nbecause to learn about all these groups\nbut but also to let folks know that it's\nnot a problem if you want to hop on\nsomeone else's group ride absolutely and\nuh sounds like you guys are part of that\nCommunity now which is\nfantastic um Alex what advice would you\ngive someone new to gravel riding who\nwants to get involved with gravel\nbossing or just start riding just do it\ndon't question it just go out ride what\nfeels good find some stuff along the way\nthat challenges yourself and push your\nlimits keep going so I was thinking the\nother day I'm riding up the bike path\nthe Arlington Minuteman Bike Path\nheading towards Lexington and there's a\ncouple of little\nTrails off of the bike path that are\ndirt I'm sure you've ridden them and you\nknow I was with someone that was sort of\na newbie cyclist we had um a bike we had\nwe were riding bikes with fatter tires\nso they weren't quite gravel but they\nwere 32s we said hey let's just go and\nAdventure off the trail and that's sort\nof and when we finished with that that\nperson said hey that's are there more\nTrails like this around here\nand the answer is yeah I mean so those\nare some of the trails you guys ride\nthat's literally the spirit of gravel\nright there is making that dude smile\nbecause he didn't expect that the spirit\nof gravel is not dead you just said it\nit's it it's really it man it's that guy\nshowing up like I said who has been\nwatching the been liking stuff on\nInstagram he's maybe even reached out to\nAlex once or twice and he just finally\nshowed up and said I'm doing it today\nit's it's magical thoughts on cyclocross\nas it pertains to gravel\nBoston we don't none of us technically\nteally a racing cyc cross we've got a\nlot of guys who have like joined the\nclub and have said oh cyc cross is like\nright up our alley um we do have uh a\ncouple guys I'm sorry there's a couple\nDave and Hal both race um but you're not\ngoing out there practicing cyc cross\nwell no we do we've got a couple really\ngood spots you probably know Springs\nBrook Park where is that that's in\nBedford where next to the VA where\nthere's a nice flow Trail then there's\nsome soft sand so will you run a\ntraining ride if folks want to do\ncyclocross with you or you yeah\nabsolutely and as a matter of fact we we\nsuggest that anybody who's going to join\nus and their uh intentions are\ncyclocross just let us know because we\nwill throw little Loops in there that\nwill let them um practice and we have\none spot that's just completely tight\nCorners in Bedford very nice it's\nperfect it's for a guy who wants to race\ncyclocross off camber it's all it's\nlovely okay to each of you what are some\nof the Hidden Gem events in New England\ngravel or not that you could recommend\nto our\nlisteners Vermonster B the Vermonster\nb2vt those guys are cool they're good\npeople um are those two different events\nyou just mentioned it's the same folks\nthey put it on together they put it on\nput them on in tandem um last year I did\nsupport for the b2vt I drove drove my\ncar slapped the sticker on my door and I\nchanged about 2700 tires wow it was\ncrazy now more like 30 so the b2vt is is\na a road event a road event and the BT\nmonster is the equivalent gravel event\ncorrect all right yeah both those are\ngood events what about you Alex say if\nyou want just looking to get into it and\ntry it out and have a fun time that's\nnot a race the uh raid Rockingham and\nthe gravel uh grvl series is a really\ngreat place to try it out and have fun\nand have a social experience I've heard\ngreat things about raid Rockingham that\nis I believe in New Hampshire New Market\nNew Hampshire New Market New Hampshire\nokay and then on the other side of the\nspectrum raspu it's a good time but it's\na race it's\nhas a Time many times on this It's\nTricky It's Tricky yeah um so Alex um I\ncan't let you go without asking about\nUnbound EXL oh yeah so this giant gravel\nrace you did in Kansas I mean so you\nfinished I finished yeah uh 26 hours and\n45 minutes 6 hours and 45 minutes 26\nhours 26 hours and 45 minutes did you\nsleep no oh my God how do you prep\nyourself for something like that ride\nyour bike ride your bike and ride your\nbike like are you doing a series of 100\nMile Road rides like what's sort of a\ntypical training week leading up to it I\ndo a lot of 100 mile gravel mixed\nterrain rides um spending 100 miles on\nmixed terrain is a really good body\ntraining um support a lot after that do\nyou do any um just curious uh do you do\nany strength training throughout the\nyear to prep your body for that I\nStrength train two or three times a week\nall through the year like squatting full\nbody y squats deadlifts bench press the\nwhole powerlifting routine it's really\nuh makes you solid for that type of all\nday endurance well congratulations on\nfinishing that I don't know anybody\nwho's finished that in my personal\ncircle of friends so I consider you one\nof my personal circle of friends now so\ncongratulations that's awesome um do you\nguys have any strong opinions about\nelectric gravel bike showing up on your\nrides I think they're good yeah they get\nmore people riding and those people ride\nfurther and faster and that's fun for\neverybody as long as they're keeping it\nwithin their limits and they're being\nsafe they're more than welcome to join\nand were you going to say something it\njust keeps the pack together right cuz I\nthink most of those people have\nidentified like maybe that if they were\nto come out and ride on a normal bike\nthey wouldn't miss necessarily be able\nto hang yeah right so maybe it's just\nkeeping the pack a little tighter uh you\nknow I don't have a problem with it okay\nnice very inclusive I'm also on the of\nthe opinion especially in the last few\nyears that um electronic bikes are okay\nyou know like there's a reason why folks\nare riding them you're right maybe they\ncan't hang maybe they have a heart issue\nmaybe they can't get their heart rate up\nso it's fantastic that uh those came on\nthe market and made it more inclusive\nfor folks to get involved with cycling\nyeah I like to see the one where it's uh\nnot necessarily husband or wife but I\nlike to see the one where it's like um\nhusband can't keep up with wife because\nshe does seven triathlons a year but\nthey just want to ride together or maybe\nthat's cool that's really cool that's\nthat is cool are you guys both from New\nEngland I forgot to ask I was born in\nMassachusetts yeah what about you New\nHampshire New Hampshire oh New Market\nNew Hampshire where the raid Rocking New\nHampshire boy right here as well tell us\nwhy you agree that New England is the\ngreatest region in the country for\nEndurance Sports the climate going\noutside on a day like today is just so\nmuch air to breathe um I don't know it's\nthat that seasonality too that says oh\nman I can't wait for the spring or I\ncan't wait to just get out there and um\nwe ride all year yeah we ride toughens\nus up yeah right would you agree yeah\nNew England is a great place to ride and\nwe have a really diverse range of\ndifferent things you can ride on gravel\nroads and single track mountain bikes\nmountains beaches everything in between\nyep that I mean those are sort of some\nof the answers we're we're getting from\nour podcast guests it is the greatest\nregion in the US um possibly the world\nso is there anything else you guys would\nlike to share with your listeners get\nout there plug any information about\nyour organization you like to share one\nthing is definitely fast cat um the\ncycling app it's a training app and Alex\ncan speak in depth about like how it\nworks and stuff like this but it's it's\npretty cool and uh they reached out to\nus about uh working with us and possibly\nhaving their logos on our Jersey next\nyear which is really cool um so what is\nFast Cat fast cat's a an app and it's a\ntraining app and what it does is it runs\nsort of in tandem with Strava it talks\nto all your external devices and\ngenerates a plan based on what you are\nasking\nin return right like what uh in other\nwords Alex would have gone in and typed\nuh I'm training for a 350 M gravel race\nand it would itemize it would have said\nyou're crazy yeah basically you need to\ntrain 35 hours a week exactly yeah so is\nit like a training Peaks kind of yeah\nit's it's headed up by a guy named Frank\nOverton he's a longtime training cyclist\num he's got heard of Frank yeah the big\ncat um so ah now I get the connection on\nthe name exactly yeah so it's really\ncool we're static um I've using it but\nAlex has been using it like really in\ndepth and he's kind of got his own as\nyou can tell training plan figured out\nuh so he's kind of running them in\ntandem together and seeing how they\nwe'll have to check that out anything\nyou want to mention Alex not really just\ncome out come out for a ride absolutely\nand and just refresh so what is your\nInstagram handle uh atravel Boston and\nmine personal is Mr shreds one mrr\nshreds one and Alex I'm Alex willand\nAlex willand I'll post these in the show\nnotes um I think folks uh listening\nshould get out there and try one of the\ngravel Boston events they're

little\nnuggets in b r and Burlington and\nConquer and Carlile and uh it just opens\nup um the whole your whole repertoire of\num you know what's in your bag and where\nyou can ride so I I highly
