      "description": "Rasputitsa is a Russian word for the mud season during spring when the roads become impassable. It is also a Gravel Race in East Burke, Vermont where people test their mental as well as physical abilities.\n\nThis year was a true mental battle, to choose to start the race and to stay in as it rained, snowed, and sleeted on us. Wet gear, frozen fingers and toes, 42 miles, and 4700ft of climbing. All in temps of 37F (3C) to 41F (5C) degrees.\n\nThis video is going to have a lot of water and mud on the lens but you'll get the idea. It was tough.\n\nFollow along @\n - Strava: https://www.strava.com/athletes/10732093\n - Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/mthistle/",
