      "description": "Rasputitsa is a Russian word for the mud season during spring when the roads become impassable. It is also a Gravel Race in East Burke, Vermont where people test their mental as well as physical abilities.\n\nThis year was a true mental battle, to choose to start the race and to stay in as it rained, snowed, and sleeted on us. Wet gear, frozen fingers and toes, 42 miles, and 4700ft of climbing. All in temps of 37F (3C) to 41F (5C) degrees.\n\nThis video is going to have a lot of water and mud on the lens but you'll get the idea. It was tough.\n\nFollow along @\n - Strava: https://www.strava.com/athletes/10732093\n - Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/mthistle/",

      "description": "From the organizer:\n\n\"We are protagonists of community, freedom, and unity through cycling. \nRasputitsa has a mission of cycling, community, and charity.  We call it the 3 C\u2019s philosophy.\n\nRasputitsa is more than a gravel cycling race. It\u2019s a homegrown self-supported challenge of the mind, body, and soul that instills people with a connected sense of place and purpose. It\u2019s an authentic experience that embraces: The Unknown. Change. All people. All bikes.\nWe believe that all attendees should have an equal opportunity to participate in our event regardless of their race, color, religion, disability, age, gender identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status or national origin. We acknowledge both conceptual and practical barriers of entry into cycling for folks outside of the dominant group of participants. Part of our work is to understand how social structures create or enforce long established patterns of exclusivity in cycling. We hope to create a safe and welcoming space for athletes, staff, and spectators from different backgrounds, identities, and abilities at our event. We do not tolerate harassment or intimidation and anyone doing so will be asked to leave the event and will be reported to race officials and the governing body, USA Cycling. We look forward to growing the cycling community with you.\"\n\nThe Out of Collective is the source for the most relevant Ski, Bike & Outdoor Reviews, Content, and Podcasts in the industry.
