      "description": "Gravel racing in Pendleton, Oregon.  The race day conditions were wet and windy making for a very challenging 60+ miles of cycling (suffering) in the countryside around Pendleton.  Warning,  there is no music added to this vid.. just the sound of wind, grunts, heaving breathing and the odd curse word from me.  It's also long so if TikTok is your thing, skip to around the 12min mark to see some mud,  a little later for a train and soon after that, some farm animals.\n\nThanks to Mudslinger and the town of Pendleton for a memorable event in another beautiful part of Oregon.",

The roads were pretty\nsmooth all in all. And some good\nclimbing on the back side.\n&gt;&gt; It's really about the the individual\ncompeting with myself more than anything\nelse.\nThis event features some of the most\namazing gravel roads anywhere in the\nstate of Oregon and the West.\nI like that it challenges me and it\ngives me a chance to be competitive and\nin something that I can actually swim."
