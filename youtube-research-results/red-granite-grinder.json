      "description": "Gravel! Been a while since I've made a dedicated gravel video, but given that I got my wife Tori out for the Red Eagle Gravel Grinder, I had to make one. Beautiful day in Geneva, OH at the Red Eagle Distillery. Bikes, Beers, Chili, and Friends... what more could you ask for?\n\nTori received several compliments on her DeFeet socks. Save yourself some money on your own DeFeet socks and accessories with code: WHITEHAIR15 at https://defeet.com/.\n\nStrava of the ride: https://www.strava.com/activities/9114397625\n\nFollow me: \nInsta: https://www.instagram.com/the_lanky_cyclist/ \nStrava: https://www.strava.com/athletes/800889\n\n#gravel",
