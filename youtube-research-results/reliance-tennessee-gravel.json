      "transcript": "good day trend setters coming to you\ntoday with my next edition of gravel\ncycling events you should know about the\nSoutheastern USA Edition volume two that\nimplies there was volume one it is\nlinked in the description below there's\nquite a few events I simply forgot about\nso it's time to correct that and get\ncracking on with this video reminder\nthese events are not corporate and in\nmany cases not expensive and in the case\nof some of the events in volume one they\nmight be free either way all of these\nevents are what I consider to be\nGrassroots they give back to the local\ncommunity in no particular order let's\nkick off with the southeast gravel\nseries which features six events in the\nstates of North Carolina and South\nCarolina and is hosted by that bofin of\nwheel manufacturing boy of boy cycling\nwhilst I haven't read any of the events\nin the Southeastern gravel series I have\nwrden in many the areas and one of my\nfavorite areas which is home to the\nValhalla race AKA Valhalla South\nCarolina absolutely fantastic riding\nbring your climbing gear and your\npeepers because there's plenty of\nscenery for you to Marvel at as you\nscaling the endless asense the southeast\ngravel series you can learn more by\nchecking out the link in the description\nbelow the next event is scratch ankle a\nvery interesting name indeed this event\nhas been around for for many many years\nand visits the Blackwater River State\nForest area of Florida up in the\nPanhandle whilst I haven't ridden that\nevent I have ridden out of Milton\nFlorida which is where this event starts\nand ends there are several routes on\noffer including for those seeking big\nmiles a 200m option details of scratch\nankle are linked in the description\nbelow the next event enters its fifth\nyear of operation for 2025 and it is the\nfried clay 200k up in Eon Georgia AKA\nMiddle Georgia this event features\nroutes by the red clay ramble and the\nfried green 50 which I believe is no\nlonger in existence a shame for certain\nbut on top of that the event promoter\nPat adds his own Touch of craziness and\nwill challenge you with many many\ninteresting roads and tracks and all\nsorts of Madness should you decide to\nsign up for this excellent event I have\nridden this event personally and it\nroyally or is it presidentially either\nway it kicked my ass be sure to bring\nyour climbing gears because Middle\nGeorgia certainly is not flat whether\nyou decide to ride race or bik pack the\nfried clay 200k the choice is up to you\nmore details are linked in the\ndescription below next up a very\nlong-standing event presented to you by\nthe capito city cyclist whose home is\nTallahassee Florida aka the capital city\nof Florida the spaghetti 100 the dirt\nversion is 62 Mi of fantastic red clay\nCanopy Roads and the long version takes\nyou all the way into Southern Georgia\nthrough a town known as Boston Georgia\nthe other Boston which is more than a\nfeeling I might add the ride starts in\nthe small town of mikasuki which is east\nof Tallahassee and all proceeds benefit\na local kids on bikes program it gives\nback to the community you have to love\nthat further details can be found Linked\nIn the description below another Florida\nevent this time near sarasot to Florida\nhosted by the score organization scr it\nis known as Piggies revenge and it is an\nevent I have ridden at least once this\nevent has many distances on offer there\nis a 20m gravel offering for those so\ninclined but if you're more adventurous\nlike I was when I last rode this vent\nthere's a 60m version which includes\nabout 20 mi of single track so it's\ngoing to challenge your riding skills\nand your\nfortitude and everything else you can\nfind further details of Piggy's Revenge\nLinked In the description below the next\nevent is based in Arkansas and I learned\ntoday that Arkansas is considered to be\npart of the southeast so that's news to\nme you learn something new every day\nthis event is pretty crazy because it\nfeatures three typ typ of Road Services\npavement single track and gravel and if\nI understand everything correctly you\ncan only use one bike to reverse all\nthose services this event is known as\nthe rule of three it is based out of\nBentonville Arkansas which in itself is\na cycling mea unfortunately I have not\nridden this event but it's on my list to\ndo you should consider doing it too you\ncan learn more details Linked In the\ndescription below another event and this\none's in the Arkansas o Oz arks it is\nknown as the Arkansas graler the Ozarks\nwere made quite Famous by a TV show not\ntoo long ago lovely spectacular scenery\neverywhere this event is new it was\nfounded in 2024 but it is worthy of your\nconsideration it is a multi-day tour\nit's not a race it's a tour so ride at\nyour leisure r at your own pace there\nare several days and distances to choose\nfrom you can learn more details

event\ncloser to the coast near Rocky Mount\nNorth Carolina and this is the Holly\nShelter gravel grinder there are several\ndistances on offer and whilst this might\nbe flatter this does doesn't mean
