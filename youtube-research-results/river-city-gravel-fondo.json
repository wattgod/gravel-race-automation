It's kind of weird\nthat they put a bike race on Easter.\nIt's kind of like putting a bike race on\nChristmas for some\npeople, but there's a amazing turnout\nanyways for it being on Easter.\nOkay, get together. Get it\ntogether. And we've got\ndust. Okay, now we got a big\nrain. Probably going to have to put my\nuh GoPro away cuz the micromod is not\nuh waterproof.

Kind of think we took the\nwrong turn.\nSo, oh well, it's up there\nanyways. How embarrassing. Oh no. Oh\ngosh, we did go the wrong way.\nBut or maybe they went the wrong way. I\ndon't know what's happening. But there's\nthe Easter color coats over there.\nHow was it? It was It was good. It\nwasn't too bad.
