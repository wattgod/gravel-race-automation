      "description": "Is this the best gravel racing course ever made? I absolutely think so. And in this cycling video I breakdown my gravel race of the rock cobbler 2023. I show you from a POV view point the entire race course and my commentary on how it went down.\n\nGravel racing in America has exploded in popularity and so many new events are popping up every year. This is the 10th running of the rock cobbler in Bakersfield California. And in my opinion, this is hands-down, the absolute best event in California if not the entire country.\n\nThis course was so dynamic and had something for everyone. Regardless of your skill set, fitness, or bike choice, this course in Bakersfield had something for you.\n\n#Cycling #MountainBiking #GravelRacing #BikeRacing #GravelBike\n\n----------------\nBest Way to Support a bro\n////// https://Ridebikes.com - In stock, ships same day! \n\n////// DELTA G KETONES - https://www.deltagketones.com/pages/the-vegan-cyclist\n\n////// https://join.Whoop.com/vc\nGet 15% off a Whoop Subscription, Track your fitness and balance that busy life of yours. \n\n////// https://www.almsther.com/veganbags\nGet a SICK bar bag bro!

      "transcript": "welcome to gravel racing\n[Applause]\nI don't want to go this way don't go off\nthe cliff don't go off the cliff okay\ndude\n[&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\ngood morning we are at the Rock cobbler\n10.0 the 10th version of this uh I've\nlearned so much from last year and so\nthe bike that I'm running much different\nthan a full-on road bike uh I also have\na skin suit and\nBella does now how stupid is mellow toes\non a eight seven hour gravel ride I\ndon't know who cares I like the way they\nlook look good ride hard hey so we're\ngonna break down my version of the raw\ncobbler 10.0 we're going to start with\nthe course kind of go through the\nsections I saw it so we started with a\nreally fast part this is everyone trying\nto separate themselves that moved into\nthe mud Canyon which was totally crazy\nand caused a lot of issues for a lot of\npeople then there was the cow path of\ndeath probably the most spectacular spot\nof the course uh then we had a insane 45\npercent grade hike a bike section that\nmoved on to the fun part the best part\nof the course absolutely amazing then I\nhad a small little oopsie we will talk\nabout this\num and not the spoiler alert but my\ncrash and rally and how I kept going\nafter the hardest crash of my life real\nquick let's break down the bike I'm\nrunning my Canyon Grizzle this thing is\nan absolute Beast now we threw on the\nSRAM xx1 derailleur mountain bike\nderailleur so we could run the 11 52\nrotor setup with the ceramic rotor\nbottom bracket and I'm running a 40 6\noval in the front huge shout out to\nJustin from competitive cycles for\ngetting this to me in time that dropper\npost unbelievable but the main part of\nthis is the forks the 30 mils of travel\ncompletely changes the way this thing\nhandles I threw on my ultimate\nintegrated bars\nso awesome light and comfy my favorite\nsaddle of all time but that dropper post\n50 mils of travel wow now we're running\nthe IRC double cross 42s with orange\nseal I've never flattened those tires\nwe're running the KDX 35 AR hookless\ngravel specific Wheels this thing is a\nmonster the absolute perfect bike to\nbring to The Cobbler we have started\nspicy\nit is spicy\nso we're gonna break down the fast part\nhere and it started with a thousand\npeople 1 000 people that's insane so\nthere was four waves 250 in each wave\nright\num so the the front of this got spicy\nfast now I'm doing 700 Watts on this\nbike path this part of the the course\nthough this is the weakest part for my\nbike so last year I wrote a full-on road\nbike setup that was extremely fast on\nthe road but I never really used it\nanytime we were on anything fast it was\nvery limited and or we weren't even\ngoing that fast like the lead out last\nyear was was really slow it's like the\nsecond we hit the gravel it was on so\nthen I was like oh of course the time I\nbring the bike that's not fast on the\nroad everyone's smashing on this road\npart but it was okay you know it got\nspicy for a minute but for the most part\nI'm feeling really really good right now\nmy fitness is on point I have been\nriding the trainer for 90 days so you\nknow like look I am ready to be outside\nand to give it the absolute berries huge\ngroup of people right everyone's trying\nto fight uh to get to the front before\nwe hit the single track my teammate\nJulian here he's actually in a breakaway\nwith Corey Williams at CBR\num he ended up getting ninth overall in\nthis race so fantastic job to him I want\nto talk way more about the race team and\nand what's going on there later on in\nthe year but look we hit this climb\nand it's it's spicy okay but not like\noutrageous no one's giving a full-on\nattack and I came in with a plan to\nabsolutely Pace myself I'm gonna Dylan\nJohnson myself I am going to pace for 80\nmiles I don't care anyone around me this\nis a new tactic for me but it worked out\nfor for Dylan Johnson I don't care who's\naround me I don't care if anyone's\nriding away from me I care nothing about\nme I'm the only one I care about so I'm\ngoing to set my power I'm going to focus\non an 80 mile five hour race and that's\nit that's all I'm focusing on now I\ndon't plan on stopping at any rest stops\nI have two bottles on me with 800\ncalories and 200 grams of carbs and then\nin my hydro pack I have basically the\nsame thing\num I've got 70 grams of ketones on me\nthat I will be taking in periodically\nthroughout the ride so I I'm dialed with\ncalories and carbs and ketones I'm good\nnow are we going mach 10 into a hard\nright uh yes and I posted this on\nInstagram 1.6 million views it was a\n[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] show dude a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] show\noh\nwow\ndumb ways to die\nso after Top Gun freaking went moctan\ninto the group I had actually lost a ton\nof space because I was like in my\nbiggest gear and whatever so now I gotta\ncatch up uh I'm probably what like 50th\nish maybe but it's time to let this bike\neat and with that 46 52 I was able to\nclimb everything outside of the hiker\nbike section which no one on the face of\nthe planet could ever climb uh I I could\npedal up every single thing\nso I was just like right now and then\ndue to the right who looks like Chase\nJackson actually that's like the exact\nsame bike that I was riding last year\nso I'm pacing myself dude in the blue\nBlows By Me that's fine cool dude I am\nsticking to my plan and I am going to\nfeel out my bike now I said this before\nuh I even got here I put it on Instagram\nI said I'm probably gonna leave in a\nhospital I'm gonna leave in a hospital\nI'm Gonna Leave in an ambulance to a\nhospital because the bike is so spunky\nand allows you this uh fake confidence\nthat you're on a full suspension\nmountain bike this bike that I'm on eats\neverything it it's so wild and so I was\nlike trying to take it a little bit easy\num guy comes around me almost runs into\na shopping cart why is there a shopping\ncart here because\nI mean there's just trash everywhere out\nhere in Bakersfield for some reason but\nI will say that Bakersfield in February\nis\noutstandingly beautiful the Rolling\nGreen Hills it I I'm just insane\ndude get on the group\nyeah you got it\nprobably one of the cooler spots on the\ncourse visually and look I talk a lot\nduring the ride I I give commentary with\nthe GoPro in my mouth uh but also to\nother people like I just give\nencouragement\nI'm Just a Good Guy Greg it is what it\nis so I'm sitting probably top 30 right\nnow and I was being a little bit\nhesitant with the bike again like I said\nI felt like\nI am going to oh I'm going to ask too\nmuch of these tires\nand then I'm going to break my face so I\nwas trying to sort of ease into it a\nlittle bit because there's so many\nplaces here where you could go 50 miles\nan hour get cross-redded and then you're\nin the ER\num and I don't want to do that so early\non again pacing myself so remember the\ndude who flew by me uh at the top of\nthat climb okay I'm catching him and I'm\nmoving on so I'm very happy with my\npacing I'm on top of my fueling like\nnobody's business\nthis is honestly\nthe best I've ever ridden uh technically\nand and intelligently like the way that\nI paste it the way I fueled it my bike\nChoice usually I'm an idiot I was not an\nidiot here\nI mean maybe I become an idiot a little\nbit later but then we go through a guy's\nhouse a thousand people go through this\nhouse\n[Music]\nlet's go\nthat was so cool yeah\nso we are flying and look I use this\ndropper post I I almost ran the battery\nout I use the dropper post so much I\nused it while pedaling right\nall right top 30-ish feeling good\nwe're pacing we're letting it burn\nlaughs\nso after a rip and Road section we get\ninto this insanely long climb now again\nI'm a genius I'm learning so much about\nhow to race bikes uh and so you know\nafter 12 years kind of I learned a thing\nor two but I have the map set up also I\nhave the live segments set up and\nstarred so that right here I can you can\nsee my bike computer dude I I know\nwhat's up I know what's up I didn't have\nto study the course like I have this\nthing telling me I've got about a 25 to\n30 minute climb ahead of me so am I\ngoing to Pace yes I'm gonna pace so well\nnow are these guys flying sure in times\npast would I have wanted to be right on\ntheir wheel yeah but not today not today\nHeather\nit's a long climb\nno I had not expected mud whatsoever\nbecause it wasn't raining why would why\nwould there be mud with no rain uh and\nso as we kept going up this climb it\nkept getting muddier and muddier and\nmuddier uh and but it's beautiful and\nagain I've got the live segment on my\ncomputer so I know about how far we're\ngoing I'm feeling really good again\npacing the carbs and ketones uh into my\nsystem fully liquid right I don't I\ndon't eat solid food but the cows not\ntoday boys\nnot today\nlast year uh cows yielded people Bulls\nneeded people not today\num so like you can see this guy right\nhere and it's so hard to explain but his\nwheel is spinning so much faster than\nhis legs if that makes any sense like\nhe's just spinning spinning spinning\nspinning and so stuck in the mud you can\nsee everyone here kind of hitting the\nsame like oh yeah we're we could ride it\nyou could ride it but you'd be doing 800\nwatts and going nowhere so way more\nefficient to walk the bike now I usually\nWalk The Bike by pushing the back seat\num but the way that that and it's so\nhard to show you but the ground is so\nbumpy it's it's uh so rough and so the\nfront wheel kept getting stuck in the\nmud and it was very hard to walk also my\nshoes I have these bonds\nthey are so stiff they are the stiffest\nthings and there's a sex joke in there\nsomewhere\num but you can't really walk in them\nbecause there's no flex in the soul and\nso I actually was like wow these shoes\nare terrible for walking in\num but they're great on the bike\ndude there's no traction\ncome on\nthat's so wild wow okay\noh wow oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\nwow that is Marty\nokay\nholy smoke\noh my God\nI don't want to go this way\nsorry so after surviving mud Canyon and\nlook this was so frustrating because my\nbike was the bike for this section this\nis where I was going to make up a ton of\ntime we're definitely not lose time\nright and so I go off in the grass\nhoping oh I it's way more traction over\nhere great idea my Chain's off\nso right when I'm about to use a you\nknow million IQ bicycle race move your\nboy's got no chain so then I'm like okay\nwell that's normal you know what I mean\nit falls off from time to time but then\nit just spins right off\nand then it just spinned right off and\nit would just spin right off and it\nwould spin right off and I'm like\nI don't understand the mechanism\nof of why the chain is not staying on\nthe sprocket\nbecause I've never had this problem\nbefore so I'm like oh it's got to be my\nderailleur something's wrong with my\nderailleur and then I'm like well I'll\njust try to put the chain back on\nbut upon closer inspection which I did\nnot really see there's so much mud in\nthe chain that it won't go on the\nfreaking sprocket\nso it's just derailing constantly\nbut I don't know that at this point I'm\nlike frazzled I'm like dude I'm I was\nliterally probably top 12 at this point\nlike the best race I've ever had going\nfor me\nand then now it's derailing and I'm just\nlike well I don't understand it and I\ndidn't really give the time to fully\ndiagnose the problem I just thought I'm\ngonna I just need to keep moving\nnow look everyone has problems every\nthat's gravel racing everyone has\nproblems it's about mitigating those\nproblems to where it's not a deal\nbreaker for your race okay uh and so the\nthing is that\nyou can only fix problems that you've\nhad in the past okay so there's a lot of\nissues that will come up that I know\nexactly oh that's the fix to this\nproblem I got it you know or I've I've I\nknow what I'm doing here I don't know\nwhat I'm doing I don't understand the\nproblem my Chain's not twisted my\nderailleur doesn't seem broken but you\ncan see it just is falling off over and\nover and over and over and over again\nand I'm now losing my cool\nsome people in gravel races uh David\nsweet actually one of them who he got a\nflat right away and then he was just\nlike fine about it bro I'm throwing a\ntemper tantrum I'm not showing you the\naudio\nbecause you would think less of me\nbecause I am literally a two-year-old\nkid who has lost their juice box so I\ntry to pull a Chris room and I am\nsprinting trying to get to the top\nbecause I'm super close to the downhill\nwell maybe I can just run to the top of\nthis\num and then I can descend down\nuh without pedaling and try to get to an\naid station to try to fix it or\nsomething and dude\nnever let me work on your bike I don't\nknow what I'm doing I'm just yanking on\nstuff I'm pulling on stuff I am so very\nmad uh I'm I'm\ndisappointed in my behavior but whatever\nI pop off okay I I don't hold grudges\nwhatsoever\num so when bad things happen I just\nimmediately go from zero to ten freak\nout you know think that the world is\nagainst me why me\nand then I forget about it right I don't\nhold on to those feelings anyways so\nthen I'm like trying to go down this\nChain's not on the bike I don't\nunderstand what's happening\num I've lost so much time probably five\nsix minutes something like that right so\nthen I get to these little Hills and\nwell I have no chains so I have to jump\noff I have to run over this little Hill\nand uh and hopefully something's gonna\nhappen right okay we fixed it there was\njust mud in the chain and it would not\ngo on the sprockets though I've never\nseen anything like that before\ndude we lost so much time\nhi Mr diet Health yeah my my lower back\nis hurting what can I do while on the\nbike to help my lower back I'm gonna\nneed some core engagement ideally a\nposterior tilt pelvis make sure you're\nfiring your glutes\nmaybe you could stand and just squeeze\nthose suckers\nput a goo between your cheeks so you can\nsqueeze it out so now we come into the\ncow path of death and uh\nI've completely forgot about that my\nbike had problems\nI'm just now trying to make the best of\nthe situation uh and top 20 was my goal\nand I'm still within that if I could\njust have a great rest of the race Brom\ntop 20 for sure uh now I posted this on\nInstagram and a lot of people are like\nbro you should have a mountain bike\nMountain Bikes you know when Roadies do\nmountain bike things\nbro everyone hears has mountain bikes\nthe guy in front of me Derek he rides\nmountain bikes he rips\ndon't go off the cliff don't go off the\ncliff\nso yeah for this very one specific\nsection for a mile is a mountain bike a\nbetter choice for sure but Christopher\nBlevins the world champion short track\nmountain biker is on a gravel bike\ngravel bikes are faster\nthe the drop bars are faster that's the\nwhole point to go fast if you want to\njust finish uh and then I fall right\nhere because like someone else had gone\noff right and my front end just it's all\ngood dude it's all good fine keep going\nit's beautiful you know what I mean but\nwe need to have a a mistake free rice\nfrom here on okay okay well\nthis bike has clapped out\nit was like nothing is working all good\nforeign\ncrap\nhere\nclose to hell\nall right\ngeez\nthe hiker bike section was gnarly very\nuh so you kind of look do you ever\npractice hiking with your bike no And so\nthere's like a form to it there's a way\nto do it um but I was trying to figure\nthat out on the Fly I think it was 45\nwas the gradient and again remember\nabout the stiff shoes the boner shoes I\ncould it was so impossible to walk up\nbecause I would go tow in and then my\nheel was coming out of the shoe\num so then I was trying to like go like\nDuck foot Like Pat like going sideways\nand that wasn't working so I started\ncrawling that was the best way that I\ncould do it but the ground is really\nsoft but it's also super bumpy\nit was really challenging for sure and I\nactually lost Derek uh you know from\ndialed Health here on the hike bike\nsection if you didn't do this right you\ncould lose you could lose two minutes\nthree minutes\nso I mean it I I just love this course I\nlove the rock cobbler event just in\ngeneral but this was the funnest course\nI've ever ridden because it constantly\nhad a new challenge a new thing and so\nyou could you know if you pace yourself\nright if you were a good Rider my\nvolatose all messed up but God it looked\ngood you know if you want to ride hard\nyou have to look good\num there's so much opportunity\nand that's what I think makes a really\ngood race course is opportunity if it's\njust a flat Road well then who's got the\nmost power right who can get the most\nArrow okay\nbut what if you have more to offer what\nif you ride all the bikes what if you\nhave other skill sets so this course had\nthat and it was like every five miles\nthere was a new thing you could do and\nthen we went into the most fun part ever\nnow I don't want to hype this bike up\ntoo much but it was the greatest bike\never to be created ever it's the best\nwith this suspension Fork uh it's only\ngot 30 mils of travel okay and people be\nlike bro just ride a mountain bike\nthere's so many other reasons why this\nbike is awesome but that suspension\ncompletely changes the way that this\nbike handles and behaves then I've got\nthat dropper post now the dropper post\nonly has 50 mils of travel there was an\noption for 75 I should have went with\nthat\nit was a little bit heavier\nbut because I've got Alpha genetics and\nI'm 6'2 the uh the 50 wasn't quite\nenough but it was enough to get Cindy\nand I am flying through this now rest in\npeace can block but what was going\nthrough my head here is that little like\naudio that's trending where he says if\nyou're not scared you're not going fast\nenough\nso that I was very scared I was like bro\nI'm not scared I'm gonna keep going this\nwas like the best I've ever ridden I\nmean this was I couldn't believe how in\ncontrol I felt and safe because usually\nI ride really really safe and now like\nyes do I crash later on sure but I have\nridden something like 13 000 miles per\nincident\nwhich is like really love like that's a\ncrazy ratio right\nuh but right here I get a little too\ncocky\nand I almost crashed\nwhat the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\nbro on a road bike with a rigid seatpost\nyou are eating dirt right there but with\nthis bike it just ate that up no problem\nnow we need to regroup we need to catch\nup we need top 20. so let's go\ndude this bike just eats those descents\nI lost a little time on that hike a bike\nbut we're gonna catch back up\nwe got it dude we've paced so well I'm\nso on top of everything we got 35 miles\nleft to go\nyou\nso now I give the cows like a hey man\nnot today buddies uh and I've got\nthree people in front of me\nso right now I'm probably 20th 19th 18th\nsomething around there it's phenomenal\nthat's unbelievable now like I've been\non the trainer for 90 days outside of\nthe snow trip that I did where I froze\nmy wiener off and and legitimately got\ngrade one frostbite on the tip of my\nweiner that's a story I will tell you uh\nsoon but other than that trip\num I've been on the trainer just\nnon-stop for 90 days\nand my power on the trainer has been\nunbelievable like the gains I'm making\nbecause of how amazing the trainer is\nfor training train training trainer uh\nis I honestly thought like okay there's\nprobably a glitch something's happening\nnow this guy had an issue a lot of\npeople are going to have issues I'm so\nhappy that I my issue is not taking me\nout of the race so like positive panda\nI'm still riding\nbut I always think sometimes man zwift\npower isn't real power\nso yeah am I am I like doing these\ninsane you know I wrote for 14 hours and\naverage 205 Watts raw average okay\nbut that's not real\nso then I would I came into this\nthinking like well dude my power on\nzwift and my numbers is so amazing but\nbut what if I can't even apply that\nbut look at this dude\nthis is not a zwifter right I mean I'm\nflying right now I'm making up so much\ntime on these little hits and to this\npoint right now my normalized power is\nlike\n280 Watts\nmy normalizes 280 watts and we're like\nthree and a half four hours in look at\nthis yo this Grizzle the Cindy Grizzle\nmakes up 15 seconds on this guy uh\nwithout power\nand that's last year I would like it was\nall power like the only time I made up\ntime on anyone was power I would just be\npower power power power power up a climb\nor wherever and then as soon as we hit\nlike a technical section you they're\ngone\nbro I I was getting cocky though\nand I was feeling so good I was in the\nFlow State\nnow if you know what flow state is uh\nit's it's where you just feel one with\neverything so hippie but man I am on it\nI'm rolling like again\nprobably 17th 18th right now and I know\nfor sure because there's another really\nbig climb and I mean we have like 20\nmiles left to ride and I'm I've got so\nmuch gas left\nand so I feel like dude there's a chance\nthat I could maybe work my way close to\ntop ten but right now all I got to do is\nnot get past and I will have achieved my\ngoal now this doesn't maybe look like\nmuch okay the stabilization on the GoPro\nis impossibly good and I've got it in my\nmouth so you can kind of see a little\nbit of how the bars are jarring but man\nthis is uh if you go off the line\nthere's hidden rocks everywhere in the\ngrass and it's extremely bumpy so it's\nlike and I'm doing 20 to 25 right here\nbecause it's sort of a false flat\nand I am going between pedaling and not\npedaling but you can see these huge\nBoulders dude\nyou know how much that would eat you\nbut I'm in the Flow State I'm viben I'm\nso good right now carbed up fueled up\nketones rolling bikes great\nand then I see a guy up the road I'm\nlike oh my goodness I'm gonna catch\nanother guy\noh my goodness I'm gonna catch another\nguy\nand then\noops\nyeah dude\nso let's break this down there's a rock\nright here\nI pedal strike that rock\nand it yeets me\ninto the ground my head bounces twice I\nactually my whole body bounces I'm\ntumbling look at my dumb face\nuh no idea that was not okay\nuh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\noh dude\nI lost my glasses\nuh\nbro\nI've never crashed that's the hardest\nI've ever crashed on a bicycle\nit honestly felt like a dream for a\nsecond I was like Am I Dreaming why am I\ntumbling\nbro that was\nI don't even understand what happened\nso my left eye stopped working uh when I\nhit the ground uh and so I I was like it\ntook me a minute to sort of like should\nI even continue writing should I pull\nout is my brain damaged but now I'm\nrunning a brand new custom fitted 3D\nprinted made in America helmet from calf\nthis is the second ride on it you can\nsee this animation this is a real MRI of\nthe helmet and so the 3D printing so I'm\ntold allows for them to make this like\ninternal hexagon that gives these like\ncrumple zones and the ability to sort of\nmimic like a mips or a spin technology\nthat disperses energy from Impact\nso that's that's the helmet the Cav\nhelmet it fits amazing because it's\ncustom fitted to your head cool but did\nit do its job\nand it's hard to say Obviously uh I'm\ngonna talk a little bit here like I keep\ngoing but I'm so worried that I'm gonna\nhit my head again you know you don't\nwant to hit your head twice\none hit is good enough don't don't crash\nagain so I'm sort of\nactually now that I'm watching the\nfootage back like this is kind of crazy\nhow fast I'm going after blowing my head\nup because like I said my left eye was\ncrossed for five minutes I couldn't get\nit to work it was kind of like paralyzed\ncoming through\nawesome thank you but the helmet took\nall of the blunt like I didn't break a\ncollarbone or a shoulder or a hip or\nanything none of my body hurt\nso then that means that my entire big\nass head took the entire force so the\nfact that I won didn't get knocked out\nis actually crazy\num my eye came back and I look I don't\nwant to like Flex but your boy used to\ndo MMA I used to punch people in the\nface and get punched I also did a lot of\nBrazilian Jiu Jitsu and I've gotten hit\nin the head before and had my eye stop\nworking in a very similar way so I\nactually wasn't alarmed by that\nbut then I got this huge second wind\nand so then I was just motoring so hard\ntrying to catch people caught this guy\non this mountain bike that we saw\nearlier in the video and the guy in the\nblack just up the road\nI got to apologize to him because I\nthought he cut the course I actually\ntook the long way around so he actually\nI I thought he cut the course and I was\nlike dude you cut the course and then I\ncouldn't get on his wheel uh but it was\nmy bad I took a wrong turn so sorry dude\num I kind of like\nsort of talked a little bit of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\nafter the race my bad I apologize I'm a\nbig man for it so anyways my bike isn't\nfast in that section so he gapped me I\nwas so bummed uh then I catch one more\nguy right at the Finish\nyou know\nit's like dude if if I hadn't taken that\nwrong turn\num potentially I could have gotten like\nfour or five more people this guy almost\ncrashes I go to the right I make a huge\noopsie again hit this hole whatever\nthat was 25th right there in front of me\nso even after all these issues I rolled\nin 26th\nwhich I'm actually really happy about\nbecause man one I could have got knocked\nout I could have broke a collarbone\nTyler Williams broke a collarbone uh my\nbike could have broke so many things\ncould have went wrong\nthey didn't\nand so then I went straight to our booth\nuh to slang t-shirts dude\nwhat a booth huh\nI mean immediately after riding 80 miles\nand getting 26th and crashing and all\nthat uh the the response to our booth\nwas unbelievable and so I didn't even\nget out of my bibs do I stayed in my\nbibs till like eight o'clock at night\num the love here was unbelievable I\ncannot recommend this event more\nall right so we got 26 which you know my\ngoal was stock 20 and\nI don't want to make vegan excuses but\nlike without the two major issues I had\ndefinitely think I couldn't\nroll in on top no it doesn't matter uh\nI'm all in one piece that's awesome\num so the new 3D printed helmet uh we\ndid get a little break in there\num and you can actually see it's kind of\nhard to see but\nit did its job it\nI mean I hit my head hard and the other\ncrazy thing is that there's science\nabout ketones and concussion prevention\nand I was all ketoned up so I think that\nthings could have could have went really\nreally bad\nand it's hard sometimes when you're\nfeeling good and everything's going\ngreat to like\nnot look at it that way like I just want\nto look at like all the negative things\nsuck but man every bad thing that did\nhappen\nwas the problem it wasn't a show stopper\nright the issue that I have with the\nchain and the mud guys broke their\nchains\nso anyways great race phenomenal course\nthat is I would say probably the number\none gravel course I've ever raced it was\nso much fun so technical it was like you\nhad to have power but you had to have\nskill and you had to be sending I mean\nit was it was tremendous the booth space\nthat we've got here has just been\nphenomenal Rex came up helping out with\nthe booth guys killing it right I mean\nit's been\nwhat do you think like this is sick\nright yeah that's awesome man people are\nstoked and they like the product and\nthey they recognize that we're out here\nto have fun and ride bikes and yeah it's\ngood vibes if you're on the fence about\ncoming out to the cobbler\nI mean look if you just ride it I mean\n80 miles right\nanyone can really get it done it's just\ngonna take you wanting to get it done\nbut it is so much fun uh I would say\nhonestly it's my number one event in\nCalifornia for sure and you can make it\nout here but I'll definitely be here\nnext year"

      "transcript": "Zach from Gravel Bike California. Back\nhere in BO getting ready for rock\ncobbler 13. Now let's talk numerology. I\nwas a little worried when we hit the\nlandmark number 10 anniversary. It was a\nreally special ride, but for the last 3\nyears, I've kept my eye on number 13.\nIt's an evil number, and Sam is capable\nof doing some very special things.\nLooking at the course profile and\neverything, it's a little bit lighter\nthan normal, so\nit can't be that easy. It's a cobbler,\nso let's roll.\nIt's the start of a new day and there's\ncoffee round to get the juices flowing\nwith an interesting development to check\nin. As the last two years, Joey has\ngraced me with our favorite unlucky\nnumber. But this year, maybe being\ntrouble adjacent was a better thing.\nWhile the sun was still coming up, vibes\nwere still high as Sam was positioned\nfor his first job. Getting those ready\nfor the 93 mile boulder distance. Lining\nthem up again. lemon style with a\nsneaking suspicion the pink eye might be\nsomeone to watch as those of us doing\nthe cobbler knew that our time would\ncome soon. Hopefully everyone knowing\nthe course well as we'd be returning to\nthat historic spot where Tony survived\nhis bull encounter four years ago.\nStarting out of Pile's camp, the first\n13 miles are going to be fast ones,\nincluding a rare early morning visit\nthrough Ethel.\nThe climbing gets real going into the\nnorthern ranchlands and our first return\nto the cobbler's most infamous moment.\nThe round mountain stretch I count as\nthe prettiest. But introducing a new\nascent by Poso Creek.\nAfter blasting down Rancheria, the\nominous Breenidge climb awaits. But is\nthe new diversion at the top easier?\nThe 10 miles after the peak are for\nrecovery and very fast with just a small\nclimb early on.\nThe home stretch doesn't have any big\nsustained efforts, at least on the bike.\nAll in all, Cobbler 13.0 is a relatively\npetite 70 mi, but get ready for a few\npunches.\nFor the first time since I've ever done\na cobbler, there were no waves, just one\nbig giant mass start. As today, there\nwere two major themes during the ride.\nMy first goal was to finish at 1:30, but\nsince we were starting a little bit\nlater, two felt a little bit safer. Not\nthat I was worried about placement. I\njust love getting back and having time\nto spend with everyone here. And\nbeginning with a controlled start did\nkeep the pace down a little. The other\ncentral theme was how Sam painted the\ncourse this year. There's always a\nframework, but there's a definite\nscience for how the route unfolds, and\nthis year I was definitely more\ncognizant with the care that he puts in.\nHaving an early foray into Hart Park,\nit's no surprise the cobbler chose dirt\nover the bike path, which shouldn't\nsurprise you being bumpier and a little\nmore sandy at the same time. And being\nfamiliar with this area, there was no\nsurprise that we'd be dismounting our\nbikes, knowing that there were other\nways around the hill. But yeah, I really\nfelt like the cobbler had started.\nWe had a couple miles up here on the\nplateau that really has an endless\namount of pathways to choose from. But\nultimately, I knew we'd have to head\ndown it. This time, taking one of the\nmost expedient routes that I've been\nfamiliar climbing many times, just\nhaving done so in our send it a month\nago. But while I don't think I've ever\ngone down it before, my prediction did\ncome true that the bumpiness would\nbecome a factor. Wasn't just the bottles\nthat were spraying all over the place,\nbut just keep an extra eye out for those\nsearching for them. So, I just look\nstraight ahead and hope for the best.\nI knew that we would be coming up on a\ncobbler landmark soon, just going into\nEthel's a lot earlier than normal. And\nyet, people still showed up, but I think\neveryone wanted to hold off on the\nlibations for now.\nWe exited out, making our way around the\noil fields where I knew this first hour\nwould be the fastest of the morning and\nalso a place where I needed to get ahead\nof pace because more flat concrete miles\nwouldn't come in until the end. So, it\nwas nice that we were working together\nto save some watts. But, I know once we\nturned into the northern ranch lands,\nthat's when my strategy wouldn't be so\nstraightforward.\nThere's a couple of key points here. is\nwe had this dirt all to ourselves.\nImmediately, it's tackling this 2.6\nmilei climb that even though the grades\nare pretty inconsistent, you can still\nkeep a good flow with it. Most\nimportantly, having good gears to spin\nthrough the tougher parts, as when the\ncobbler happens on even numbered years,\nthis is the first big climb you'll\nprobably have to face. But if you're\nunfamiliar with Bakersfield, I'm sure by\nnow your outlook is really starting to\nchange, especially this time of year\nwith the greens that maybe have waned\njust a little bit since it hasn't rained\nin a month. And the dry spell might be a\nbigger issue than having no rain at all.\nBut this is a pretty clean section. And\nfinishing off around the 1 hour mark put\nme in pretty good shape. Now, while we\nhad a few dips, it was good to finally\nget some extended downhillage, as this\nsection would be a good spot to see if\nsizing down from my 55s to 50s was a\ngreat idea, not being bounced around too\nmuch, even more towards the bottom. That\nevaluation point only lasted a couple\nminutes with a return to climbing with\nanother mile and a halfer where the\ngrade wasn't that egregious and was able\nto keep a conversational pace, which is\ngreat because the cobbler is like a\nhomecoming. pretty centrally located\nseeing people from across the state and\ngreat to see Joe as this was kind of a\nsendoff before back surgery but I was\ntaking stock of myself too with my legs\nnot feeling terrible but having done\ngravel and wine and the LA tourist race\nthe last two weekends I wasn't feeling\nquite springy but maybe things will\nchange\nwhile we had our first single track\nsection of the day I was pretty aware of\nits history glad that the group was more\nspread out now than it was 4 years ago\ngo because definitely the top is a\nlittle tenuous. But even as it started\nto flatten out, I knew the skinniness of\nit would be testing. And while I didn't\ncatch it on camera, I'm pretty sure I\ncrash at the same spot I did before. Not\nbad, but landing square on my arm that I\nhad split open the week before, making\nme feel like I had one and a half hands\nto work with.\nBut fortunately, our path split away\nfrom the part of the canyon that turned\ncyclists into matadors and more\nimportantly not descending as much,\nmeaning more elevation to gain back. But\nthis is another climb I'm familiar with.\nGlad that we met it only halfway with\nthe road being a little chunky, but\ndefinitely tolerable in the up\ndirection. Just a little bit of putting\nyour head down here and maybe not\nnoticing the views as I remember topping\nit off would not go well for everyone.\nAnd while kudos to those that rode all\nthe way up, I don't think expending that\neffort is worth a few seconds it'll\nsave. I guess run with whatever\ntechnique works for you.\nWhile there is no nomenclature out here,\nwhatever dirt road we were on, we were\ndone climbing it. And shockingly, we're\npretty much done for this area because\nwhen I break down cobblers, I divide\ninto regions like the northern\nranchelands. And while this course had a\nlot of similarities to the toughest one\nthat happened two years ago, the biggest\ndifference had been some climbs were cut\nout. So this year in the ranchelands, we\nonly had about 11 miles instead of 18.\nAnd you're always thinking here, is\nthere something dubious that isn't\nshowing up in the numbers? But I knew we\nhad a lot of downhill coming. And even\nthis back section here we've done\nbefore, it was still sloggy, but we were\nonly doing about half of it. Now hitting\nRound Mountain Road earlier than I\nthought, I definitely felt like I was\nplaying with house money. But would I\ncash in,\nwe weren't on pavement for long as at\nmile 23, we passed our second pit stop\nthat I decided to pass through, still\nbeing on my first bottle. But the story\nhere was the first time we rode by Poso\nCreek that was fun little single track\nif you're also into dodging shrubbery\nwhich felt a little like the dag of a\nsystem that would have been\nexponentially worse had there been\nrecent rains. But this little water\ncrossing ended up being deeper than I\nthought. Not just mucking up my rear\ncamera, but also cleaning off a lot of\nlube on my chain. Eventually this\nswampiness seed is something a little\nbit more favorable being back on ranch\nland. But this being our third year in\nthe Round Mountain region, this was our\nfirst introduction to this incline.\nDefinitely not as steep as the other\noption thanks to its serpentine nature\nand at 2 mi at 5% stayed pretty steady.\nSo I definitely prefer gaining elevation\nefficiently rather than forcing myself\ninto the red zone which would come later\nat the top. I knew that we merged with\nthe previous climb coming up on these\nderks. And maybe one of these days I'll\nremember to take back some of this\ncrude. But what I always seem to forget\nare the high amplitude of the hills at\nthis juncture that only count as a\ncouple. But once again, I do choose to\ndismount. But peaking that steep grade\nsends you into the next downhill,\nbringing back that amusement park feel\nagain. And after that climb, you feel\nlike you should be getting a lot of\ndownhill return. But it's strange that\nfor the next 4 and 1/2 miles, it\nactually evens out and just enjoy it\nwhile you can. But from a videographer\nstandpoint, I wish the sun would pop out\nof the horizon because I think the round\nmountain area is my favorite just as\nlong as there's no issues with the\nboines.\nI knew there would be some punctuation\nleaving Round Mountain, but with this\n2/3 of a mile climb paired with a\nreasonable grade, it was easy to accept.\nAnd once again, feeling pretty good\nabout my progress. And while my body\nwasn't feeling any better, more\nimportantly, it wasn't feeling worse,\ntoo. With one short descent down to make\nit to Rancheria, that was teeth\nchattering with with the horse hooves\nembedded in the dry mud. But I was\nthinking glass half full on how much\nwe've avoided it until now. Exiting out\nto my most anticipated pit stop with the\nGrizzly Cycles crew on hand and Kevin\ntaking pics with this Hawaiian vibe as I\ntook an extra minute or two here. Great\nto see their couch make it in from the\nhome office along with Priscilla\nattending bar and it was quite the\nscene. But leaving there was some\nconcern on my mind knowing making it to\nBreen Ridge Peak would be the most\ncritical part of today's ride.\nThe good news is I could expedite my\nprogress here. Definitely needing this\nthree and a half mile descent down\nRancheria with wide turn so you don't\nhave to think about much and a great\nplace to let your hands, arms, and\njoints recover as I was cognizant to get\ninto a tuck to save a second or two.\nCrossing the Kern River would signal\nthat the next phase would start soon.\nMaking our yearly return into Rio Bravo\nRanch, which definitely feels welcoming\nat this entrance. And I figured future\nboulder champ Lachlan Morton would have\nalready been ahead of me. So following\nhis line was pretty temporary. Familiar\nthat we making our crossing underneath\nthe 178 as every iteration I've done the\ncobbler had us go through the creek but\nalways having to guess how much water\nwas in there and how much my setup would\nget doused.\nYeah.\nThe good news past the crossing is the\ndistance to the top of Breen Ridge is a\nmile and a quarter less than it was 2\nyears ago and would be even more if we\ndidn't circumvent these orange trees.\nThough we did have one constant being\nthis nearly mile and a half climb, which\neyeballing it doesn't look anywhere near\n7.3% average. And the bottom part is a\nlittle more gentle. And maybe the views\nhave something to soften your attitude\nto. And I'm sure if it had a name like\nCal Trail of Death, we'd feel far more\ndifferently here. But as we progressed,\nit wasn't the grade that was so much the\nproblem. But yes, we could feel the\npresence of that heavy herd underneath,\nconstantly having to weather bump after\nbump. And even with some front and rear\nsuspension on my bike, it definitely put\nme on the pain train. And of course, the\ntop is even worse. And here, I did\ncontemplate whether walking was the\nright move, but I decided to stay seated\nbecause we're only a few miles from the\npeak. And maybe I paid a little bit of a\ntoll, but I plan on doing a lot more\nwalking on the next climb. Cresting is a\nreal reward for the legs and the eyes as\nyou can start to make sense of the\ndynamic with these Kern County hills\ncoming into contact with the southern\nSierra. But you can't get too nostalgic\nhere because here you really need to\ngrip it and pay attention as I had the\ncourse loaded and then somehow taken off\nas not reading the sign right and hello\novershoot which in the scheme of things\nmight not be that big of a deal but\nmentally having to add those few extra\npedal strokes might now put you in the\nright frame of mind.\nOn the upside, I had more people around\nthanks to my timing. And the story here\nwasn't exactly more downhill, but\nnormally we're headed back up this hill\nfor another shore climb. That by itself\nisn't normally tough, but around here\nthe punishment starts to feel\nexponential as the lead into Breen Ridge\nis a familiar one. Normally, crossing\nalong this fence line, though,\nconditions felt worse than previous,\nneeding to stay on that pack down strip\nto feel efficient, making it harder to\npass. But this really wasn't that long\nof a stretch. After releasing for this\none little dip down and the familiar\nmomentum suck here that turns into a\nhikabike. How's it going buddy? This is\nwhere I feel Breen Ridge begins. As\nthere's one thing that I dread on these\neven numbered years is having to climb\nit. But this year I knew there were\nstretches where the ascent was\ndifferent. But I had no idea if it was\nfor the better or worse. I just know I'm\nthankful at the bottom where the\nclimbing is palatable. And my mental\ntrick is to calculate my time like I'm\nbiking three miles per hour because\nanything faster would feel golden. But\nthese fells were nice to say high and to\nbring up my squeaky chain which there\nwas nothing I could do until I hit the\ntop of this peak. But the biggest\ndevelopment here was this unexpected\nsingle track that I'm pretty sure wasn't\non the map. But even as bumpy as it was,\nit was definitely far more direct and a\nlittle less climbing. So at worst, there\nwas no loss here. The one calamity I\nknew I could not avoid was this deep dip\nthat yeah, I normally focus on keeping\nmomentum on these big U-shapes, but here\nit just doesn't really matter and in my\neyes was the most painful hike a bike so\nfar, but at least it was familiar. While\nI had it longer, this gentleman informed\nus we were a mile and a quarter from the\ntop. Mentally, it would be better if I\nwas on the wrong side of it. As from\nthis part of the climb, it's hard for\nnumbers meaning anything just because\nyou still can't see where you're going.\nThe biggest change to Breidge happened\nhere in this final mile. Not starting\noff good because of this dubious\ndescent. But once we were down here, you\nhad a little bit of that trench feeling\nfrom episode 4 and a little DIY action\ngetting around things. But the real\nupshot was not having that grueling\ngrade we normally do because there's\nalready been so much walking in the last\n20 minutes. Then it's nice to get a flow\nhere even though you had to stop for a\nfew seconds here and there. I memorized\non the map that this final right turn,\nthe end was so close. Looking down this\ntrench I knew was unique, so I had to\ntry pulling out my camera, which third\ntimes a charm, was able to finally catch\none of my crashes.\nOnce again, not that severe, but I need\nto stop falling on that arm and rounding\nthis curve. I'm glad that man was right.\nDefinitely going to put some chain lube\non and refill the bottles because even\nthough the next 26 mi mostly downhill, I\nwas going to need it.\nEven with the 4-minute pit stop, I was\nstill ahead of where I wanted to be.\nRolling out 5 minutes before noon. And a\nwarning to those jumping back on the\nbike, take the extra couple seconds to\nput everything away because I was still\nfiddling with all my accuchants and the\ntop of this canyon is a little rocky.\nSo, I was super fortunate not to crash\nand definitely took it easy until I got\na handle on things. But once the debris\nstopped becoming cumbersome, I was\npretty sure I was going to enjoy this 5m\nstretch of dirt as my right arm provided\njust enough strength not to fail too\nbad.\nHeat.\nHeat. Heat. N.\na slight detour this year. Going above\nthe ranch and said through it, but\neither way, I knew that the end of the\ndirt was near and seeing the\nwell-wishers on the side confirmed it.\nand entering Breen Ridge Road. Maybe\nthis one mile climb could be a buzzkill,\nbut the slope isn't that severe. And the\nnice runin helps, too. Unless you're\nreally struggling, it'll only take a few\nminutes. And my concern wasn't how fast\nI did it, but more that I was going over\nit alone. With the next four miles being\nconcrete downhill, but the grade here\nisn't as studious, which is kind of at\nthat grade where you still have to pedal\nand be nice to have anyone else just to\ntake turns. And it was a good move to\nhave someone watch the intersection\napproaching at speeds 30 m and above.\nAnd if you're in the mood of playing an\nunforgettable trick on your family, tell\nthem you're taking them to amusement\npark and then show up to the enchanted\nforest. I'm alone. I'm trying to occupy\nmy mind here. I knew approaching the\norchards I'd be veering off soon, but\nsince I didn't have the turnbyturn\ndirections on, it's a great thing to\nknow you can always rely on the cobbler\ncourse markings. Time for us to take our\nlong turn on Edison Road, which is a\nthroughway for some doiciles. But really\nfor us, we have to be on the lookout\nbecause of the constant up and down and\nsome giant cutouts thanks to some\nunexplainable erosion. You have to be\nreal cognizant out here trying to find\nthe correct line because I've caught\npeople losing it here on video.\nBut it was noticeably smoother turning\noff as we were coming into dirt bike\ncountry. still able to make good time\nthat I wasn't worried so much about\nspeed, but just keeping the legs moving.\nAnd any stretch of pavement that would\nhelp expedite, I was for it. Though\nthere was still an inner worry that Sam\nwould have something up his sleeve, but\nI didn't think it'd be here south of the\nhighway. The one thing that didn't\nsurprise me was this last climb. Not\nnecessarily a hard one, more of a\ncheck-in on how lumpy your legs felt.\nBut reaching morning drive. I hope that\nwas our last real climb on a bike using\nthis overpass for a traditional crossing\nof 178 and then back onto some wandering\ndirt which there's so many throughways\nhere. It's hard for me to remember the\ndetails. But the route returned to\npavement. Thank you suburbs. Where I had\nbeen lonely for a while, but I could see\nup ahead that I'd be merging soon with\nthe Pebbler route entering Hard Park,\nneeding to cover 9 miles in about an\nhour. But I was going to remain\nsuspicious until the cobbler was over.\nCoursewise, we could have saved some\ndistance just cutting straight across.\nBut I had no complaints about this\nU-shaped progress because I really\nappreciate what Sam had done with this\nyear's route because I was really\nimpressed with what Sam did with this\nyear's course because there's obviously\nmonths of planning, but coming up with\nthe final is a chess game. As a month\nago, this area was reading far\ndifferent. So since that time, I'm sure\nhe had a plan for rain or lack of rain.\nAnd while there were some teeth\nchattering sections, he did a fantastic\njob keeping them at a minimum. And I\nthink everyone's just going to remember\ntoday for the fun.\nWe rolled by this oddlooking facility\nthat we normally come across on our\nJanuary rides that I referred to as the\nHawkins facility from Stranger Things.\nBut while the most efficient way around\nis hugging the fence, the cobbler route\nbrought us on the single track that on\nour send a number of locals always split\naway and it's never really for that\nlong. So I was curious to see what these\nhills held. And even with a little\ngripage, I was glad for the experience.\nBut returning to the center of the park,\nI knew what lay ahead. As this zone\nright off the bike path is normally\nwhere the featured hike a bike section\nis, and you're always curious to see the\nawe that others see approaching it. But\neyeballing it, I wasn't as intimidated\nas normal.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, clearly this is one of the tamer\nones. I mean, there's an actual road and\nI'm not having to dig my feet in on the\nside.\nAs for my first time at the cobbler, I\nwas able to push my bike up all the way,\nnormally needing to carry it or to turn\nmy feet sideways from keeling over. So,\nI was thankful not being caught on this\nridge and asking someone to throw me a\nrope at the top. My legs weren't too\nwobbly to get back on the bike. And\nthere was a lot of encouragement here.\nSeeing people who I just saw seconds ago\ncoming right back at me. So when I made\nthis hairpin turn, I pretty much felt\nlike the worst was over. As coming down,\nthere were limited opportunities to try\nand extend this course. I was just\nhoping Sam wouldn't put us through\nquicksand or making us swim in the\nriver. And while this last descent\ndidn't have those careening corners like\nthe refrigerator or Toad's Wild Ride,\nonce I got through the rockier top\nportion, I had the same type of fun. Not\nas high as the Amplitude going side to\nside. Definitely a lot more\nstraightforward and a few more chances\nto catch some air, but at the same time,\nI just wanted to get back and not use\nthis as an audition for Jackass. making\na left turn to overlap the stretch that\nwe did 60 miles ago and definitely far\nmore expedited thanks to having gravity\nonto our side. Once again, needing to\ncross Alfred Herell Highway and with\neveryone spread out, of course, we were\ngoing to use the tunnel if I could fit\nthrough there. Making my way into Lake\nMing County Park, I knew I was going to\nmeet my time goal. And at this point,\nthere was little use of turning the jets\non. And instead, I was hoping some of my\nfriends would catch up. And this area is\nshared by a lot of locals, not just for\nthe bike riding, but also camping as\nwell. And when we had that one final\nsection right along the water, it might\nhave been a good thing to actually go a\nlittle faster because I just felt like I\nwas bumping all over the place just\nspinning. But then again, I wasn't that\neager to find out as I knew I was in the\nfinal stretch seeing all the parked\ncars, which I guess I paid more\nattention to rather than staying on\ncourse. But no matter, it was great to\ncome in and hear the event crew call out\nmy name.\n&gt;&gt; We're grabbing by California\nRu\nout there. Way to go.\n&gt;&gt; And another thing that makes the cobbler\nspecial is its post ride environment.\nAlthough Peter completing the boulder\nand his spokes might disagree, I think\nthese slightly scaledback routes\ndefinitely helped the mood here with the\ntime frame of people coming back\ndefinitely far more concentrated, which\nmeant more something I can't get enough\nof as this was my favorite event so far,\nfocusing on the fun that is the core of\nRock Cobbler.\nEasily my favorite Rock Cobbler so far.\nYeah. Okay. It was a little to do with\nthe distance, but I mean, you come out\nhere, you know what to appreciate. Now\nthat I'm 5 years in everyone that was\nout here, yeah, I think they had the\nsame sentiment. It's always topnotch.\nGreat photographers, great views,\neverything you want. And Sam,\ncongratulations. So, yeah, let's keep it\nthis level 14.\nAnd if you want to support us, please\nhit the subscribe button, put a comment\ndown here, or go to our shop, support us\non Patreon, so we can bring you more\nfrom Sed."

      "description": "In this gravel cycling video, I walked through my experience and my race at the 11th edition of the rock cobbler in Bakersfield, California. This turned out to be my best ever finish at a proper gravel race, which is strange, because I went into it with zero expectations and just wanted to tell a good story of the course. \n\nThe rock cobbler is one of the most dynamic courses on the gravel cycling circuit. With steep and technical downhill, pitch steep, pitches to climb, and wild cattle to gallop with. I raced the boulder route, which is the newest and longest version of the rock cobbler. Only 50 spots were available, so it wasn\u2019t a super stacked field, although there were racers like Peter Stettner and Tobin, who are certified hitters in the gravel cycling race scene\n\nSTRAVA : https://www.strava.com/activities/10737176358/overview \n\nSUPPORT: https://www.RideBikes.com\n\n\n0:00 Intro\n1:19 Course\n3:14 Moving Up\n8:15 Stick to the plan\n11:13 Cliffs & Cows\n16:30 New Body \n19:35 On your left\n24:03 The Race Is ON!\n28:41 Finish",

      "transcript": "[Music]\ncool\nall right we uh start in like 2 minutes\nlook at the booth I got my boy my boy my\nson it down three two one off you go new\nyear new\nme every other race I've ever done I\nhave gone to the front and just tried to\nbe as irrelevant as possible for as long\nas possible until I explode into a\nmillion pieces today's\ndifferent I'm going to paast myself I'm\ngoing to take in my inner Dylan Johnson\nand see if I can Pace this thing to a\ngood maybe top 10 maybe I don't know who\ncares we're just going to have a good\ntime I'm so very excited to show you\nthis race this is the third time I've\ndone the rock cobbler it's one of my\nfavorite races on the calendar uh I got\nto have a booth brought my son it's the\nstart of a huge 3-we trip and really my\nfirst start of the season now this is\nthe boulder it's the newest version of\ntheir route so there's the cobbler in\nblue and then the boulder you can see in\nred just has this extra out and back but\nit's a huge climb up to the snow and\nthere was only 50 spots available for\nthis bigger one uh the promoter was a\nlittle bit afraid that people weren't\ngoing to be able to finish in time uh it\nwas going to get dark and that sort of\nthing and you're on private property a\nlot of the time so only 50 spots\navailable we got in this is kind of the\ncourse profile it's a lot of super\nPunchy steep stuff basically on no roads\nuh within a huge climb up to the snow\nthe start foggy relaxed it's pretty\nchill there are hitters here though at\nwhich I kind of hoped there wasn't going\nto be but Peter ston was racing\nit you know we all signed up for this\nthis one because you weren't supposed to\nbe in it and now you're here Sam made me\ndo it man okay yeah it's his fault now\nas you saw in the title and this whole\nstory of this race is about how this was\nmy best ever finish in a calendar gravel\nrace cuz I'm pacing now look usually I'd\nbe at the front drilling it dude I\nstopped and threw this jacket into this\ntruck which I don't even know if they\nwere a part of the event I never got\nthat jacket back but I am pacing myself\nunlike I've ever done any of the other\nrace I've ever done is that I just try\nto go to the front and and be as\nrelevant as possible for as long as\npossible this one dude I'm chilling this\nguy's got a freaking like ice chest on\nhis bike uh and so then look we need to\nstart moving up a little bit cuz we're\npretty far back we're about 25th and\nlet's just get the vibe of the\ncourse\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 hey we're top 10 we\nall right we're pacing really really\nwell but\nyeah feel great right now but we are\nalso like one mile into this thing we'll\ntalk a little bit here about the bike\nwhich is literally the same exact bike\nthat I rode last year I mean down to\nlike I don't even think I changed\nanything on it it's the same tires it's\nthe same chain it's the same cassette uh\nI probably need to do like a fresher up\non everything um but we're running 42s\nwe're running a suspension Fork uh we're\nrunning a dropper post a one by a 46 to\nan 1152 which I actually forgot that I\nwanted to go down in the front from last\ntime uh and so I should have ran a 44 or\neven a 42 in the front but the 46 52 was\ngood enough for the power that I had\nbrought to this and I'm going to talk\nabout this later on in the video but\nyour boy has gotten sick I've put on\n30 lb 30 lb in the last two years so\nit's uh a little bit different racing\nnow with so much mass on me and that's\nanother reason why I'm coming into this\njust with a different Outlook I don't\nreally feel like I want to be super\ncompetitive and honestly racing has just\ngone past me to to be real the uh\ncompetition at just any basic level race\nis just insane and so I think\nAmerica uh as in a cycling sport is is\nhitting it alltime high but not in the\nway that people would think Road riding\nroad\nracing it's not totally where a lot of\npeople's focus is and so you're getting\njust insane talent coming and racing\nthese races so what do I want to do I\nwant to be able to tell good stories you\nknow obviously I'm competitive but I\nneed to change the way that I'm racing I\nneed to race to my strengthes\nand my strengths are kind of more\nendurance-based so you can see that I'm\nletting huge gaps open up also because\nthe drafting here is basically pointless\nuh with the how technical everything is\nand how steep everything is you don't\nneed to be right on someone's wheel you\nknow so then look at the kind of Gap\nthat I was able to close just with good\ntactics good pacing I didn't need to\nburn all these matches to stay with\nthese people I dude I caught that guy\noff like a I don't know 15sec Gap and so\ntrying to be more smart also dude my\nbike setup is freaking dial dude with\nthe dropper post and the suspension\nFork uh I you could get yourself into\nsome trouble because it felt so good\nalmost like a mountain bike uh that I\nwas I was dude I was rolling now I did\npost a bunch of this over the last\ncouple years and one of the main\ncomments was always oh oh Roes are so\nstupid just get a mountain bike oh\nmountain bike mountain bike Mountain\nBike okay do you see that huge hole\nthere dude if you wen't paying attention\nyou could eat bananas but so let's talk\nabout the mountain bike thing you could\ntotally have ran a mountain bike and I\nactually brought my mountain bike cuz\nI'm doing 24 hours in the old PLO the\nweek after this which is a 24-hour\nmountain bike race so I had it with me\nand to be honest it it was borderline\nequal I don't think I would have been\nany faster or slower on the mountain\nbike it would have been uh more\ncomfortable maybe but it's just like a\ngive and take there's certain sections\nwhere obviously I'm showing all the\ngnarliest stuff cuz it's kind of boring\nto show you the flat whatever stuff that\nlike a road bike or a gravel bike is\ngood on so obviously I'm sort of\nmanipulating the footage where if this\nis all you see and this is all it is\nyou're like oh dude the mountain bike's\nthe way to go but you know to me I have\ngood enough bike handling skills where\nthe gravel bike is my preferred method\nbut this course was so Dynamic which I\nlove I love when a course that you could\nrun a road bike or a mountain bike or a\ngravel bike or whatever and you're going\nto hate it at some point and love it at\nsome\npoint so cows uh I get close to the 2A\ngroup I don't know if this is the front\ngroup or not but I give a little bit of\nan effort nothing too crazy but I do\nhave snot flying off my face and so I\ntry to bridge up to this group which I\ndon't know and turns out that this is\nthe front group this has STNA this has\nuh Tobin this has a mike spikes guy I\nmean this is it this is the front of the\ngroup these are the hitters I'm like\nholy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dude this is kind of sick I\nthink I'm like top eight now definitely\ntop 10 so can I stay with these boys am\nI good\nenough so we're sitting seventh out of\nawesome so let's just try to keep this\nchill let's not have any issues let's\nstick to the\nplan waa that was\ncool it's very slipping oh God no [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\nthat was not cool uh Mr sweet and I are\nin a group chat together and and and I\nconsider us homies so like he had an\nissue with his bike and he had to get it\nrepaired so he got kind of dropped out\nof this group because of an issue now\nI'm trying to chase this mike spikes bro\nwhich I don't know his name but anyone\non mike spikes is going to be a hitter\nuh I kind of do this little swoop action\nclose up but you know Peter where's\nPeter's left the chat Peter's gone okay\nhe's he's out of here and you know um\nmaybe this wasn't the division for him\nwe got our boy Tony fallen out due to a\nmechanical which I want to talk about\nthe Mechanicals really deep here in a\nlittle bit uh but I am doing my best to\nhang on to this group but also not\ncompletely empty my take so I mean you\nsee I'm doing 500 something Watts but\nnow that I'm super big and heavy it's\nhonestly not that impressive but let's\njust stick to the plan let's keep\ngoing\nsure we have so much to\ngo so I'm vibing sometimes I feel really\nsketchy and just not in tune with my\nbike right now man I'm feel I'm taking\nhuge risks uh and I'm just fing which is\nmaybe too\nmuch oh my\ngod dude I almost died there was many of\nthese moments but you can see here\nyou're supposed to go left uh like this\nI am going straight and for whatever I\ndon't know how this happened but I go\noff the cliff my whole bike is off off\nthe cliff I know that doesn't look like\nmuch but it was much I mean my whole\nbike fell off the cliff and somehow just\nlike yeed itself back so it's things\nlike that that are just luck and I had\nluck on my side and then immediately I\ncome to another section which back to\nthe Mechanicals I broke my cleat so I\ncould not Bunny Hop and I get to this\nposition and I'm like huh great can't\nBunny Hop what do I do I'm going to lean\nback and pray\ncool now I have been getting so lucky\nand I'm going to just leave you off on\nthis next little bit just want you to\njust suspend your animal rights comments\nfor a\nsecond but I just come across this her\nof cows and like soaring with the Eagles\nI galloped with the\ncattle\nbe one with the cows become the\ncow and you will graze among the\nHeavenly grass fields for\neternity I have no idea where I\nam there's no way I'm on the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\ncourse dude where am I dude I have no\nidea if I'm on the\n[Applause]\ncourse looking good looking good woo\nyeah buddy go dude that was wild with\nthe freaking cows man we're not doing\ntoo bad right now man uh we're about 20\nm in so 100 miles left to\ngo that was wild going down those\ndescents like full\nbeans so we got some food in us some\nmaple syrup some fluid carbs changed our\nbattery dude\ncontent creation is in full swing now I\nconnect with this guy and me and him\nbattled for the rest of the day uh so a\ncouple things one the content creation\nuh I don't want to dive into this I\ndon't want to like talk about how the\nsausage is made but your boy makes some\nsausage uh I had to change batteries\nthree times during this and I have a\nmedium mod that's why it sounds so good\nis that there's a mic on the GoPro but\nyou have to take that whole thing off to\nchange the batteries and it's very very\ndifficult uh I have a massive memory\ncard I have 512 GB but I shoot in\n57k like massive to get just beautiful\nfootage I also have an ND filter which\nchanges things anyways dude I had\nrecorded almost the entire race and that\ntakes a lot of work dude to like think\nabout when you're going to be able to\nchange the battery how you're going to\nbe able to change the battery what shots\nto get so I'm very happy with how I'm\ndoing that so far\nuh we get to this little rest stop where\nthe boulder is uh going to go left and\nthe cobbler is going to go right so this\nis the difference now we start to ascend\nthis massive massive climb uh we're\ngoing to go way up to the snow and we're\nkind of just settling in this is a place\nwhere you know you could you can't win\nthe race but you could lose the race so\nwe're going to check in with my life bar\nI've been pacing well but I am I'm\ngetting a little depleted okay I've been\neating right been trying out this\nAnderson's maple syrup I've been\ncrushing that's actually really really\ngood uh got some good fluid carbs with\nme got a bunch of ketones we're rolling\nso I'm going to talk about my weight in\njust a second but the first thing is the\nMechanicals gravel has now been around\nlong enough to where look Mechanicals\nare just part of the game that's it\nyou're going to have issues part of\ngravel racing is how to manage those\nissues I have a broken right cleat it's\nan issue it is what it is we're going to\nkeep moving now on to this\nbrother two years ago I thought this was\nPeak\nPerformance since then I have added on\nclose to 30 lbs of lean\nmass uh it's actually wild so this is\nnew me not sticks and Bones I've went\nfrom 155 lb to about 185 kind of depends\non the morning poop but this is me I'm\nheavier I am stronger my watts are\nthrough the roof\nbut I'm heavier and I'm paying for\nit there's snow almost there almost to\nthe\ntop and then\nwe're not even\nhalfway big day big day for today so I\nhave had to bid fairo to uh my\ncompetitor who out climbed me because\nagain dude I'm sticking to my plan I'm\nnot trying to stay with I'm not trying\nto flex even though I've got biceps to\nflex now\nuh I'm not doing that sticking to my\nplan so I grab a Sprite should be\nsponsored by Sprite I had 10 of them and\nuh threw some chain lube on and it was\ntime to rip down again the\nMechanicals dude is my bike sounding\nlike it's going through a wood shipper\nsure but everyone is going to be dealing\nwith this kind of stuff you know what I\nmean it is what it is uh I did I brought\na vest I was freezing I honestly think I\nwas getting slight hypothermia because\nuh my brain was no longer working\num I I couldn't think I was so cold\ngoing down this\ndescent is what it is but I am able to\nget stock of where I am now I don't know\nwhat position I'm in but but future me\nis telling you I'm in sixth right now uh\npresent me thinks I'm top 10\nsomewhere because I kind of just let\neveryone go in the beginning so I you\nknow I still know I don't know if\nanyone's had Mechanicals I have no idea\nbut I'm able to now see behind me you\nknow and and are there is there a big\ngroup that's going to catch me are there\nsome hitters that maybe had an issue and\nnow they're coming for me you know how\nhow worried should I be about the people\nbehind me and uh it was good news I\ndon't really need to worry about a lot\nof these people behind me there's a big\nenough Gap but I am feeling terrific\nright now I haven't burned a single\nmatch which is definitely different then\ntimes passed now you're going to see a\nlot of people because strangely the\ncourse loops back in on the cobbler now\nthey started 2 hours after us so I'm\nabout mid pack with the cobbler and so\nanyone ahead of me potentially could\nhave got him with a good group and would\nbe flying but hate the game not the\nplayer I'm going to do the same thing\nI'm going to try to get myself in a\nsolid group and\nroll okay so I didn't know this but uh\nWe've now looped back onto the\ncobbler and then they started the waves\ndifferently so\nnow we get to ride I get to ride with\npeople I'm not just a rolling\nsolo\nso this is\nsweet so I'm now getting to ride with\nsome people cuz I kind of been in no\nman's land for a little bit and look I\ndon't care what position you are give\nsome encouragement when you're passing\npeople be positive good work\ndude good work be positive Panda because\nit honestly helps you to just like I\ndon't know be nice to people but it\nhelps them too like they're all stoked\nanyways side rant so we're now getting\ninto kind of the cow path death section\nuh lots of talk about rain from this\nevent it did rain a ton the week before\nbut on this day was perfect the mud the\ndirt was uh like velcro it was very\nstrange it was super sticky and so you\nwere almost like stuck to the ground you\nhad unlimited traction which felt\namazing um but also kind of robbed a lot\nof your power so you really had to be\nsteady with the power that was another\nbig thing about pacing now because I'm\ncoming through the pack right uh can't\nreally take the exact line that I want\nor or ride the way I want but also I'm\nable to gauge what is ahead of me I can\nsee people right in front of me like\ndude I can't but either way I enjoyed\nbeing able to ride through people it did\nalmost blow me up though we got freaking\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtle here uh it\nalmost blew me up because I'm\nfeeling so good that I I want to keep\npassing people right I want to keep it's\nlike always a a a rabbit to catch and so\nyou feel like you're making progression\nbut dude I'm not racing any of these\nguys these guys are doing the cobbler\nI'm doing the B\nand and so I don't even know am I\npassing anyone in my race who is in my\nrace I have no idea I'm sure that\nthere's number plates uh that I could\nhave understood about but dude I have no\nidea who I'm actually racing so I kind\nof started to turn up the the the\naggression a bit and and start to put a\nlittle more big bit of an effort in cuz\nagain don't know but to show you just\nlike how steep some of this stuff is I\nmean a lot of lot of people are walking\neither way bro it's so beautiful out\nhere the\nhills so\ngreen so beautiful just insane and now\nit's so warm it's almost like hot so\ncrazy to go from snow to you know\nfreezing to death to then out here\nyeah\nn\nthings are going quite well now okay did\nI past myself super awesome yeah and it\nwould be easy to say why don't you do\nthis all the time\nmy rebuttal is that even though I did\nget the best finish I've ever had I had\nno chance at a win because of the way I\npaced so there's that but still we are\nsticking to the plan it's been really\nawesome catching all of the Cobblers cuz\nit gives me some people to talk to and\nhang out with and now I've got a draft\nlook at this\nwhoa I got hell of friends dude it's\nawesome grab myself some potato chips\nand you know I'm eating them do the salt\nthe sugar\nyum now the race is really going to be\non\nthough so I did use this group to catch\nmy my competitor the guy in Fifth in\nBlack if you can see check in my life\nhere I am losing a little bit but dude\nI'm not empty I'm not empty at all I'm\ngolden but this\ndude uh in Black you can see him there\nhe's fifth I'm sixth he was a hitter I\nmean he he was really good so I would\nget him in a few sections and then he\nwould pass me and drive away from me and\nI was constantly just trying to get back\nonto his\nwheel and so because I was in this mind\nof pacing it wasn't like surging with\nhim I wasn't staying on his wheel but\nwhen we started to get into the road\nsection where drafting is a thing I kind\nof had to switch my mind to be like okay\nyou can burn matches now you you're good\nwe're almost done with the race and so I\nI kept falling off his wheel I'd get\nback on I'd fall off his wheel I'd get\nback on and now the race is on and look\ntop five how cool is it to say top five\nbut if you get six you're top 10 you\nknow what I mean so I want top five I\nreally want top five and I'm staring at\ntop five but then we get to this\ninsane freaking hi aike section which is\nso wild that we're going zero miles an\nhour\nbut the race is on like me and him are\nfully racing right now I got to beat\nhim so it doesn't look like it but this\nis the absolute PE of the race I mean if\nif he gets over the top of this first\nI'm going to have a huge gap to try to\nmake up so I'm trying to hike I'm trying\nto figure out how to throw my bike over\nmy shoulder I don't quite have the right\nyou know Vibe here but at the very top\nhe had a a little bit of an issue\nclipping in and I got a gap and I went\nall\nin\nso now we're on the fin fin approach\nhome we're on the bike trail and I don't\nknow how close he is to me I don't want\nto look back at all uh and so I'm just\nkind of like head down and I'm trying to\njust kind of empty the tank but I have\nno\nidea that I am coming up on potential\nfourth place like I just think dude sick\nI got top five dope but there's fourth\nplace just ahead of me and so then I'm\nfreaking out I'm like bro I've never\nbeen in a situation where I have gas\nyou boys got gas at the end of a race\nand so I kind of look back at Tony cuz\nhe had had an issue with his race and so\nhe had to go back and fix it and then he\ncame back out and helped me film which\nwas awesome because my GoPro died um\nabout an hour before the finish so he's\nhelping me get some shots and I'm full\nTT mode we're rolling and dude there he\nis there's fourth place I freaking kind\nof slingshot past him and and he's\ncracked but maybe he jumps on my wheel\nit's totally flat so I am just\ndigging digging so deep this extra\nweight paying dividends your boy got\nsome glute muscles biceps traps tries\nhamstrings flying so I'm feeling really\ngood about this and now I I honestly\ncan't believe that I'm I'm in fourth\nthis is the best ever finish I've ever\nhad in a calendar gravel race like a\nreal proper gravel race\nwe get to the Finish crazy sand whoop\nsection like dude don't fall don't fall\ndon't fall don't fall don't look like an\nidiot okay sweet we made it\nthrough you\ndude yeah\nman\ndude the best finish I've ever had in\nany gravel race\nfourth dude I'm I can't I don't even\nknow have the words man I'm usually\nhaving to give excuses that was the best\nride of my life dude that was so awesome\nand a huge thanks to my boy Tony for\ngetting the footage which I did not\ndraft him be clear on that uh my GoPro\ndied the last like 20 miles dude how an\nknowing if I do the best I've ever done\nand I have no footage of it I'm like\ntrust me bro yo\ndude\nso"

      "transcript": "[Music]\nZach from grite California here in the\nmiddle of rock cobbler where I forgot to\nshoot an intro today I think we're in\nfor a much better ride cuz I'm already\ninto it but not as much saturation as\nthe other years also early course\nreviews\nmight be a little bit less technical but\nit's really about the second half on\nthis one po hi a bike maybe one of the\nworst\nso no extra hand I'm\nrolling rock cobblers are always hard\nbut I was pretty eager for this addition\nworried that some eye irritation would\nkeep me out 72 hours ahead instead last\nlast minute maintenance was the biggest\nimpediment I had to\novercome for 12.0 the biggest difference\nwas a starting point almost 10 mil to\nthe east in the heart of the\nhills the first 14 mil would be fast but\nwould it be hard to keep groups\ntogether with rain coming in a couple\ndays before it was more the conditions\nthan the numbers to worry about around\nBreen Ridge Rancheria Road was a steady\nclimb and a rare opportunity to dictate\nyour own\nTempo pyramid Road offered some stunning\nback roads experientially in multiple\nways the ranchlands was the toughest\nregion of the day not just for the main\nclimbs but the pitches in\nbetween whipping around the pavement was\na nice reprieve but there was reason to\ncall it quits\nhere har Park was short and most\nmemorable thanks to the refrigerator and\nthe annual hika\nbike once back to pedaling it was a\nseries of high notes all the way\nin all in all we felt the 9300 ft of\nclimbing but it was far more palatable\nthan the year\nbefore the heat is on but it wasn't\ndoing much good even Sam needing a\nwakeup call to get G\nwith the longer Boulder taking off\nearlier using a leemon style start\ndefinitely having the effect of\nsplitting up their group already cooking\nthe pace riding a dozen miles more than\nme though we had the luxury of a warmer\nstart also because being packed into\ncloser quarters and maybe the return of\nmy devilish\nnumber our cobbler wave had more to\nmaneuver over the starting line glad for\na smoother roll out without having to\nrun for our bikes as it was good vibes\nacross the board even with the natural\nanxiety of riding in a pack but I did\nwant to stay out in front before we hit\nDirt 3 and 1/2 miles in that was\nthwarted by me trying to fix my rear\ncamera while keeping Pace with the\npressure picking up as we turned off of\nAlfred harell Highway thinking the dirt\nroads would provide opportunity to move\nup but our instructions told us to First\nfollow the arrows not our GPS and while\nthis last minute add-on made us pedal an\nextra mile more it was so much fun that\nSam gets a pass for going off\nscript the Jets did cool as we returned\nback onto course glad I did make the\nselection of riders across this closure\njust wanting to keep the legs moving\nhaving a piece of strategery going into\nthese three miles of dirt to stay\nconnected with a group by the time we\nhit road which was hard to do while\nfilming paired with handling all of\nthese rollers that was not as easy as it\nlooked the unexpected thread of rain\nlurked as a possibility while untimely\nmechanical Les was more of a concern\nwith this momentum sucking Hill my\nupcoming burden but these short Punchy\ncins aren't good for someone like me in\nthis WG class ending up further behind\nthan when I went into\nit bur some\nbullets turning onto Breen Ridge Road\nstarted a 4 Mile climb but a majority of\nit was at below 2% meaning I'd rather be\nC in if I could get position even if I\nhad to beg for magical powers as I\nseemed to be just far enough away until\nwe reached our crossing a half of the\nway up now back in The Graces of this\nhandful saying goodbye to the farmlands\nbehind transitioning to the ranches in\nthe Foothills realizing I had to dial it\ndown a little bit knowing that taxing\nmyself early would hurt exponentially\nlater on\nthis mile reprieve was welcomed enough\nalso marking our disengagement with\npavement for a while hitting 12 miles of\ndirt in the traditional Breen Ridge\nbacklands that also marked the start\ninto private Holdings noting we had 5\nmiles until we reached the peak that was\nmostly the same as 2 years ago except\nfor the first third that had a similar\nRolling Hills profile staying a little\nmore Above The Fray with Long Shadows\ncommanding only an hour into the\nride past these Gates start one of my\nmost anticipated segments of the day not\nthat this threemile climb was daunting\nat 5 and 1 12% but how 2 years ago this\nCanyon was transformed into a mud pit\nthat's the closest thing to being Green\nDay at\nWoodstock there was a big concern for\nmore of the same today day with some\nrainfall coming in the middle of the\nweek and while curve after curve it was\nhard to see what's ahead overall\nconditions were as perfect as they could\nget except being an hour into the ride\nthings were far more lonelier than ever\nbefore so it was nice to have a couple\nof riders pass wondering if there was\nsome far off catastrophe keeping me\nsolo while the peak is a grind like most\nI skipped the first aid station ready to\nhave an honest take on this 3 m downhill\nthat was too wet to use the road last\ntime out and even though it wasn't as\nEmerald as before I was pretty sure I\nwas going to enjoy these three miles\nmore than the last\nI definitely appreciated the fun this go\naround but we still had dirt to tackle\non this side of the 178 that I enjoyed\nthe best on this Edition not that we\ndidn't have work to do here still\nneeding to summon my bottom gears but I\nwas glad we weren't climbing as high up\nthe hill as other additions while still\ngetting some downhill benefits as well\nwith our rockiest section so far to\nCobble the good thing about being a semi\nveteran here is the familiarity of the\nterrain and getting ahead of when you\ncan let go of the brakes but also\nknowing when I could use a particular\ncamera I was harder shooting today as\npeople were more spread out and I'm\ntalking about Riders because Sam has an\namazing number of volunteers out there\nnot to mention men made out of\ntacos I misook the solar panels as the\nRiver from afar but it's a good thing\nthe cobbler has the best course markings\nbecause as far e easier to focus on\nthose than constantly looking down at\nyour\nGPS I knew this 17A Crossing wouldn't\nneed to be controlled but the question\nwas how much water would be flowing\nthrough nice that these climes didn't\nput me in the red yet with the mighty\nKar River below rewarding with views\ndoing our regular exit out of the Breen\nRidge segment but not without some\ngood-natured ribbing you sure\nokay those that did the pebbler made a\ndirect line to Har Park they had their\nown separate aid station led by the\ngrizzly Cycles crew fully stocked for\nall nutrition being on top of properly\njudging today's Antics and setting up a\nhome away from home but of course they\nadded something special sing up a photo\nbooth for those that missed out in their\nbike prom as yeah I want to be with the\ncool kids\ntoo I was ready for a Rancheria Road\nportion of the ride though I didn't need\nto ask for advice having ridden Beyond\nwith Alejandra from kumbre all the way\nup to Oak flat a few summers ago but it\nshould be obvious crossing the Kern we\nwere bottoming out starting our nearly 5\nMile climb with good sight lines to see\nwhat's ahead because there are also\nother vehicles using the road and\nimpediments to keep Livestock in not\nveering off far from his 4 1/2%\naverage everyone was enjoying the\nopportunity to spin their legs with\nRancheria switching its composition\nbefore the halfway point but the change\nin surface didn't affect us much\ntransitioning to the hills tapering\nthemselves back and the occasional\nrockscape introducing itself\nthis was a nice way to clock off some of\nthe day's elevation starting to feel\nlike I was rejuvenating myself making\nour turn just as Boulder leader Pete\nSTNA was coming back down but I was\nchoosing to use the pit stop this time\ngoing for a full refuel while being more\nefficient than other years even spurning\nthe rig toss although the money would be\nnice technically there was another half\nmile to climb but we were entering one\nof the newest areas of the cobbler\nreturning to the round Mountain Area\nfrom last year this time going further\nNortheast of pyramid Road where nothing\nlooked like it had been touched except\nfor the mini pies which would be\nimpossible to avoid for the duration and\nwhile crossing over the ridge took away\nsome of the Innocence no complaints for\nthe Thrills over the next mile and a\nhalf\nit's reassuring to have people looking\nout for us as far off as we were\nalthough it's a service here not\nprovided 365 days a year but I was\nfamiliar from here on out merging with\nthe segment from last year in the\nopposite direction ction punctuated with\nthe large sweeping Hills without the\noverwhelming Greenery of last\nyear though these painfully steep\ninclines were still presence I chose not\nto ride the most taxing Parts instead\nstaying fresh for the more nominal ones\nknowing that the recovery times were\nminimal glad to have momentum more on my\nside no one needed to justify this\nanomaly of flatness ready for that one\nlast Ascent out of this sector with a\nview we weren't going to get for the\nrest of the day closing the door on our\nround Mountain segment that apparently\nincluded one of my water bottles as\nwell our riding on the open road was\nbrief with our next climb waiting on the\nother side having just passed today's\nmidpoint though the second half half\nwould be more\nrobust the numbers don't lie l their\nnumbers there were three major climbs in\nthe northern Ranch lands with the first\nclocking in at 1 and 3/4 miles at 6% but\nafter a consistent first half the\nparticulars get skewed presented with\nthis flat reprieve as the surroundings\nlook just as\ninconsistent with the end of the Ascent\nemphasized with this extreme peage\nsetting the tone until our next rest\nstop the next two miles were Laden with\nextremes with a number of soul sucking\nPeaks to contend gazing up at the ridg\nlines that look romantic From Below\nthough reaching them is quite the strain\nin practice meaning you might need a\nsecond look at the ride profile that'll\nlikely Overlook these steep offering\nbut your body won't\nforget at least the panoramas are\nappealing and if you grind enough there\nis payoff even if it's just 5 minutes of\nfun you'll take\nit there was a a short directional and\nelevation transition before our next\nclimb but glad still to have gravity on\nour side for a while with a deviation\nfrom our recent visual selection rolling\nby this Ranch complex making me feel a\nlittle like being home but our second\nmajor climb of the ranchlands awaited\nwith this dip making you understand why\nthe 6% average was deceiving though at\njust under a mile was the shortest\ncategorized in this region reinforcing\nmy this is just temporary Mantra and I\ncouldn't tell if the speed limit sign\nwas a joke but the entertainment value\non the single track wasn't\nthe timing of that high note hit the\nspot coming up on our last Pit Stop of\nthe day and while I was hoping it would\nbe a short one I got caught up in the\nAntics still love you and then technical\ndifficulties made a 16-minute stop that\nI almost had to pay rent for after that\nsetback I start our longest climb of the\nranch lands clocking in at just under 4\nmiles miles that at least was only at 3%\nbut it was still climbing at this point\njust focusing on clocking off the miles\nglad I still had energy in the tank\nbecause when you get tired physically\nyou make mistakes mentally sometimes not\naware of the simple Kass you should\navoid of course the peak was the pitous\nof this climb with the last seven miles\nthis region of the thumbs up variety and\nunless you're trying to limbo under your\nown bike as the majority of the\nremainder increased your average speed\nwhere the undulations are gently\npleasing feeling like I was on a\ncarpeted Planet but the flow was\nsomewhat interrupted by the sliver of\nsingle track with a dubious start though\nonce I could release the brakes it was\ntime to make memories of the good\nvariety but you had to watch out for the\nbones of the Bine\n[Applause]\nafter that stretch Spirits were at\nall-time high even without the reminder\nall of us do love gravel especially with\nthese shorter efforts as this little\nHilltop gave a quick look at our our\nlast test ahead leaving our final\nportion of today's private lands hoping\nfor an expedited last 16\nmiles despite the headwind the flat\npavement more than made up for it with\nPhineas doing his all to raise my\nspirits and everyone else with my heart\nrate glad to jump on this train getting\nus quickly back towards Alfred harell\nhighway but I should have predicted this\ndetour returning back into Ethel without\ncharging admission but I did pass on the\nbeverages being so close to the\nend after spitting down the highway we\nmerged back with the pebbler in heart\nPark and yes we definitely had some more\nclimbing to do but this was the main ENT\nwe'd be doing here on a bike that after\na long day in the saddle was nice to\nhave company though looking down down\nbelow feeling like I was waiting in line\nat an amusement park knowing the best 2\nminutes of the day lie ahead ready to\ntake in the joil refrigerator segment\nthat I rode last month but this time\nwith no one in front to ride it as I may\ndefinitely that is one of the most\nuniquely playful stretches of dirt\nanywhere and if there wasn't a smile on\nyour face you did it wrong though\npassing above heart Park Lake was a\nsignal for those that knew that\neverything of the type one fun variety\nwas coming to an end with the Mad\nscientists here to watch his creation\nthanks\nSam as this was visually the most\nimpossible looking hika bike so far hard\nto comprehend how to even start with no\nclear Rules of Engagement how to tackle\nthis other than seeing how far Brute\nForce could take you and the frisbee\ngolf was irrational enough to provide\nsome distraction with my back hurting I\njust bit my lip and plowed on heading up\ntoward salvation\nwhich is not right with these crazy\nmechanisms in our hands and maybe it was\nmy determination being a major factor\neven as the peak was the worst part\neliminating the moments where I came\nclose to giving up got me up there\nfaster than I could even\nimagine while there was a little\nclimbing after it still brought our\npulses down obviously needing a descent\nhere to get us out of heart Park and\neven though the playful level was high\nit was not enough to get that vertical\ntaste out of our mouths crossing under\nthe highway knowing at least the rest\nwas bearable glad to jump on a pace\ntrain for these last three miles relying\non that final Rush of adrenaline to get\nus home and that unnecessary final pitch\nonly making sense in a rock cobbler way\nas the new finish brought the same old\nfeelings with the post r\nalways a big highlight of this event not\njust for the fresh hearty meal awaiting\nbut how it's like a high school reunion\nexcept it's people you know from across\nthe state that might also be here\ncamping out as you could pull up to any\ntable to share War Stories where we'll\nall be back the second Saturday of\nFebruary for another rock\ncobbler well what can I say I'm so glad\nmy eye came through because thought this\nwas going to be a special course and it\nwas I mean first of all I do prefer\ngoing counterclockwise on Breen Ridge\nand conditions do play a big part but uh\njust so much playfulness and yeah there\nwere hard Parts too but I don't know I'm\nstanding still so I guess I definitely\nCobble any want support us hit subscribe\nbutton go to our shop or support us on\npatreon so we can bring you
