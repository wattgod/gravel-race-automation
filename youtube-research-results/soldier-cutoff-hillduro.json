      "transcript": "all right welcome everybody to the Iowa\ngravel series Podium podcast I'm your\nhost Chris McQueen and like always we\nhave an amazing guest for you this is\nJesse comes that we're talking to today\nshe stood proudly on this Podium yet\nagain in at PESA this is her second time\nalthough looks like there was a little\nbit of an upset maybe we'll talk a bit\nabout that but uh this and this is the\nsecond time we've talked to Jo Jesse\nlast time we had a great opportunity to\nmeet with her and Julie B of uh and talk\na lot about Prairie bloom a wonderful\nCycling group out of Omaha the largest\nCycling group in Omaha and it's women's\nonly it's amazing so we've uh we love\nhaving Jesse on the show Jesse thank you\nso much for being here heck yeah\nabsolutely so Jesse how have things been\nin the last year uh since since uh we\ntalked last and have there been any big\nchanges uh I don't know maybe that's\ngoing back too far no I'm trying to\nthink of because we talked to you gosh\ntime goes by way too fast I think we\ntalked to you right after Pisa last year\num so lots of things the race team\nstarted up um earlier this year so last\nyear it was just the club um we now have\nthe race team so um uh so in terms of\ncycling that's that's been big um um uh\npersonally just work is always busy and\ncrazy and and stuff like that but um but\notherwise it's just been you know the\nrace team and and supporting uh Julie\nand anything else we can do to get that\ngoing um but yeah lots of racing lots of\nbike riding this year um so a lot more\nraces this year than I did last year so\nwow that's great so it's I think we were\ntalking a little bit before we we\nstarted the the recording and everything\nbut it sounds like you\nbeen heavily you've heavily participated\nin the Nebraska off-road series yep um\nyou're you're on the Prairie Bloom\ncycling uh team that's sponsored and\nofficial and does stuff and uh and then\num anything else in terms of like main\nfocuses main focus this year was there\nany big races that you got to compete in\nthis year gosh I feel like my aace you\nknow I uh I did the Gunnison Growler\nwhich is bike race out in gunon Colorado\nso um I trained heavy heavy for that one\num and you know like I said my main goal\nyou know I know purpose of this podcast\nis gravel but mountain bike I feel like\nthey both kind of help me in one way or\nthe other my technical skills with\nmountain biking help the gravel the\ngravel length and endurance help in the\nmountain biking so to me I I kind of see\nthem side by side sometimes but um but\nyeah just you know there was gravel\nworlds just Spearfish South Dakota with\nthe bunch of local uh people um went to\ngravel Nationals that was pretty amazing\ngot to be a part of that so I didn't do\nwe didn't do the full 131 miles but uh\nwe were able to see Keegan Swenson win H\ngravel Nationals which if anybody knows\nme well I'm a huge Keegan Swenson fan so\nI got to meet him Julie Julie was my uh\nwing woman and we got to meet him and\ntake a picture with him after the race\nso um a lot of highlights this year uh\ndid a did a race in bre and ridge of\nover the 4th of July it was a uh option\nto do a Duo team so I did a co-ed duo\nwith my H boyfriend Colin lle uh who is\na member on the chaos team um so we did\npretty good for being Flatlanders\nagainst a bunch of Colorado people I\nthink we kind of ended up in the middle\nsomewhere um but yeah lots of races and\nthe season's still not over so um a few\nmore coming up so oh wow well yeah\nthere's a lot there's a lot in there um\nI because um oh shoot I'm you mentioned\nit very at the beginning it's out P out\nin the Black Hills the first oneish\nSpearfish Spearfish Spearfish I've done\nI've done the Spearfish Marathon but I\nmean that's a beautiful area and that's\na that's a mountain bike race gravel\nworlds is gravel y uh Nebraska off-road\nserieses mountain\nbiking uh there was another one in there\nI wasy trying to get kind of a ratio\nbetween gravel and uh oh I also forgot\nchaos chaos does Tuesday night world\nso I did all the crit series too so I\nended up I think myself and Morgan\nschaen were the only two women to do all\nthe the races this year so this year was\na lot of racing supporting the teams um\nuh uh just yeah a lot of racing this\nyear a lot of racing the year of racing\nthat's that's fantastic I have still I\nstill want to get out to do a criterium\nuh do some crit racing at some point it\nscares the crap out of me oh me\ntoo me too it really does but it's\nreally more of a like a Time issue than\na than a desire at this point like my my\ntime is more of a problem than than my\nfear so I I think I just need to fit it\nin schedule\nit so let's talk a little bit about I'm\ncurious how you've been fitting this all\nin you said you were really busy with\nwork but this is a lot of racing like\nhow how are you balancing that lately um\nwell lately I'm not\num I think I mentioned before we got on\nthe the podcast here uh I actually have\nnot been able to write as much as I\nwould like um just lately with work\nabout a month ago my my supervisor left\nand then so did my assistant controller\nI'm in the uh uh uh business and finance\num office over at UNO so um and this is\nmy busy time so I've been been pretty\nswamped but uh um yeah I you know really\nmy focus you know you know I don't have\nkids or anything like that so I am able\nto have a little bit more free time and\nflexibility with with cycling um so um\nyeah I mean if I wasn't working or you\nknow spending time with friends and and\nI was cycling so that's just kind of my\nbiggest hobby so um weekends come around\nand you know the lawn might need to be\nmowed or the house needs to be clean but\nmy bike needs to be to be ritten so um\nyeah somehow priorities yes absolutely\nyes well but you know I struggle with\nthis too I mean I've got a I have a\nfamily I have a job I have the gravel\nseries I have uh that someone nominated\nme to be on the HOA I'm like no that's\nthe meanest thing you could ever do to a\nperson um you know we you get really\nbusy and I find that I've I'll spend\nlike a good chunk of my morning like in\nhalf a kit like I'll have my bibs\nunderneath my work clothes and then I\nknow I'll have like an hour break\nbetween something and I'll either jump\non the bike and hit the road or I've\njust I've tried to be more flexible and\nbe okay with the fact that like maybe I\nwon't get it in at the exact time that I\nwant to right but trying to fit it in\nsometime in the day what do you find has\nbeen working for you um you know the\nbeginning of this like I I had mentioned\nI did the Gunnison Growler in May and so\nthat was kind of my first aace of the\nyear and I did a lot of training\nregimented schedule and whatnot and um\njust with work and the stressors of that\num you know really priority has been\nsleep and then and then riding when I\ncan so right now it's it's mainly been\nfocusing on weekend rides more for fun\nyou know less regimented um training and\nwhatnot um so uh you know I mentioned to\nyou too uh bohenian snowmill is a\nSaturday and so mainly just doing that\nfor fun I've always wanted to do it um\nit's in a cool area uh of Nebraska and\nyou know just about an hour west of here\nso um really you know I right now I'm\njust like if I can ride a couple times a\nweek that's going to be fine where you\nknow before I was like go every other\nday at least or you know and then in\nbetween doing yoga or something to you\nknow stretching or you know because the\nolder I get the more aches and pains I'm\nfeeling and so um yeah it is it is heavy\nto to Really balance all of that but uh\num I'm probably a little bit less\nregimented than some but um it's also\ngetting towards the end of the season so\nI'm just trying to have a good time so\nyeah I think that's good well so tell me\na little bit why why bomi Stow meal like\nyou you sound like you're excited for\nthat one I've not done that one yet but\nit was it's always one of those ones\nwhere I feel like it has a bit of it's\ngot a bit of a history it's uh it's it's\nvery much in that more of a Grassroots\nbut also more established realm um tell\ntell me what what you're looking forward\nto there I think all of what you you\njust basically said grass Roots um all I\nhear are great things about it that\npeople have done um I always want to\nchallenge so I've heard it's it's\nchallenging um honestly I like that it's\nkind of on the smaller scale I I I\nlooked at the registration list it's not\nover the top it's not going to be like a\ngravel worlds and you have to make a\nwhole ordeal of it not that that's a bad\nthing um and again like I said I mean\nit's a free entry fee too I mean that\ncan't get you know that not that usually\nthat deters me from doing anything but\nit's like why not try it you know um and\nuh um I just again it's just I think the\nI think all women finishers get a free\ncake from from gold Rod pastries too\nwhich is that that was something that I\nwant to bring up I wanted that I'm like\nI'm pretty sure there's some really good\nuh snacks out there I don't know what if\nthey do anything for the guys or\nanything but uh um yeah I'm not sure\nabout that but oh and the last thing I\nwanted to say is um another reason I\nwanted to do is I literally I have never\ndone a Sentry it's on my list surprising\nI think it's because I do more mountain\nbiking and doing a 100 miles on a\nmountain bike is really really hard so\num I just thought it would be cool I'm\nlike hey why not give it a shot and have\nBohemian Stone it be my first century on\na gra you know doing a gravel ride so\nwell I think the weather's going to be\non your side at least from what we're\nhaving here on on this side of Nebraska\nso yeah it's going to be a little chilly\nI think I think it's like high of 58 60\nwhich I love because I love fall weather\nbut I think the start's going to be like\nyou know excuse me upper 30s maybe 40\ndegrees so it's going to be a little\nchilly but i' rather be chilly than hot\nyes uh so what's your strategy going\ninto this what are you thinking in terms\nof like pacing and what you're what\nyou're hoping to do and you know I'm\nreally just trying to have a good time\nlisten to my body um because like I said\nI haven't been really like\ntraining I know I can do 100 miles it's\nnot how fast I'm going to do it probably\nnot very fast but uh Carly Thompson who\nis also a h perig Bloom race team member\nis also doing it so I think we're just\ngonna kind of play it by ear and just\ntry to have a good time and Race by feel\nwe're not going for any records or you\nknow anything like that but um yeah just\nkind of seeing how the body feels and\nI'm like well if gravel worlds is like\n70 you know I did the 75 which\ntechnically ends up being 78 I'm like I\ncan do 22 more miles I know I can do it\nso um but uh yeah really no strategy\njust kind of going out there making sure\nI've got enough fuel enough water and\nand uh just gonna enjoy it really um not\nhave any expectations if if that makes\nsense so yeah well I think I think if I\nremember right um You you tend to do\nyour best when you go in with this\nstrategy because at least last time we\ntalked and and I think this year in Pisa\nand maybe we can talk a little bit about\nthat uh is\nyou you know you i' I've heard that you\nhave the the tendency to say hey we're\njust G to go have a good time we're\ngonna have a good good time and then\nJesse like about 30 30% into it 40% into\nit it's like all right it's go time yeah\nI I like to go hard let's put it that\nway um I don't like to ride slow but I\nlike to ride within my means so unless\nit's a race but like I said even though\nthis is I think considered a race it\njust doesn't really feel like a an\nactual race so um I don't really feel\nany pressure I'm really just doing it\nfor fun and uh yeah\njust yeah writing within my limits yep\nwell I'm excited to hear an update on it\num let's and I really do want I want to\nhear about the cake like I'm I'm really\ncurious about the cake they look amazing\nand sweets are like two of my top\nfavorite things so I'm pretty I'm pretty\npumped about it so it's one I mean it's\none of those things you can kind of mix\ntogether pretty well I I did on Saturday\nand I'm by the end of it I'm like give\nme something that's not sweet oh yeah\nsometimes it it can be a little bit too\nmuch yeah for sure yep yep so anything\nmemorable so Pisa turned out a little\nbit different this year than last year\nso in\n20202 we had a sweep by the Prairie\nBloom team it was fantastic with Jesse\nyou you on in first place this year a\nlittle bit different um only because we\nhad I don't know if she's infam but I\nthink of her as Infamous the infamous\nTeresa Bender oh yeah yes Teresa\nis I tried to hang with Teresa as long\nas I can she's just she's just on a\ndifferent level let's let's put it that\nway in a in a in a good way so so when\ndid like do you remember I I I know\npisa's been more than a month away so it\ncan be a little tricky do you remember\nhow long you stuck together and then at\nwhat point you kind of got\nseparated I want to say probably\nafter\ngosh I really don't know Chris I'm gonna\nprobably I probably think I tried to\nlike hang for about 10 miles and then I\nwas like okay I cannot sustain this for\nthe rest of the race so it was probably\nfor about the first 10 miles um just\ntrying to stay up with the group you\nknow catch a draft from the guys and\nhang on as long as I could but um yeah\nand then eventually I was like okay I\ncan't do that any longer and then I I\nthink I synced up with Todd iberg at one\npoint and then I ended up probably\nriding with him for a lot of the race so\nthat was cool so it is nice to have you\nknow I I personally I love it when I can\ncan like kind of look around and say hey\nwhat are you thinking like I I I I I um\nfrom my running days I remember when it\nwas nice when you do a marathon or a\nhalf marathon you you kind of could get\ninto like Pace groups you're like all\nright everybody here is GNA try for a\n7:30 or an eight8 minute mile or\nwhatever um I sometimes wish we had a\nbig enough field or had Pacers um on on\nthe routes so it's like look you're if\nyou're aiming for that you know that\n4our Mark on this gravel racer if you're\nreally GNA want to push it you want to\nbe 330 if you're going to be up in the\nthree you know three hour mark you're\nyou're on your own yeah yes in terms of\npacing but everybody else maybe every\nevery 30 minutes um because I think you\ncame in right around\n345 which I thought was really solid\nyeah I beat my T I mean I think the\ncourse was a little different last year\nbut I think in terms of mileage and\nelevation I don't think it was too too\nmuch different was it um no we keep I've\nI've kept it a bit of the same so for\nthose who are listening for the first\ntime Pisa is an interesting race it's\nnot I most of the races on the Iowa\ngravel series are 100K or 50k and I try\nto keep really close to that 60 uh you\nknow 62 63 miles uh range pis is a\nlittle bit unusual um in in its\nelevation and so I've historically\nshortened it um mainly\nbecause I feel like the way it wraps up\nfor the most part feels about right and\nnobody's ever been like dude you you\nshorted me like yeah eight miles what's\nup with that yeah um and so this year\nwhat happened is there on 2022 we had a\na Class B road called ideal and the joke\nwas always that it wasn't ideal well it\nwas it was less than ideal this year\nthey actually turned it from a Class B\nRoad into a Class C Road and they had it\nchained off and I I talked to the the\nfolks that because now it's under the\nmanagement of the of the property owners\nnearby um I talked to them they were\ntotally up for me having folks go\nthrough there but it was it was really\nrough it like either had to be mowed or\nbladed or something it was it would have\nbeen tough so I I shunted everybody off\nonto another uh Class B road which the\nName Escapes me right now but I did have\na memorable moment on it yes it it was a\nit was a great route I yeah I it tends\nto be a route though where I uh just\nkind of put my head down and just push\nas hard as I can so uh it was it was it\nwas a rough race for me this year it\nfelt it was tough for sure so what\nhappened what what made it was there\nanything\nspecific um I don't really know it's\nfunny it's like some races feel really\ngood and others just feel really hard\nand it just felt really tough this year\nI don't know it just I I put my head\ndown and and it was funny because last\nyear it was a lot sandier there was that\nSandy section that I almost went down\nlast year and and that didn't happen\nthis year but um yeah I don't know I\nthink just maybe trying to to uh go\nabove my limit maybe the first 10 miles\nkind of set me up for the rest of the\nrace but um uh yeah and you know I knew\nfton was coming you know you know last\nyear I did no race Recon I had no idea\nwhat to expect and I zoomed up that\nGravel Road thinking oh I just got to\nmake it to the top of this Gravel Road\nand I'm done no last year you take a\nright you're like no so I knew that was\ncoming this year so it was kind of like\nuh I I don't even think I got all the\nthe way up the gravel road even so I was\nlike I I've got some time let's just get\nup this thing and and go from there so\num yeah it was just a tough race like I\nsaid I just I like to ride hard and uh\ndo best I can see what my body's capable\nof so it's always hard it's yeah it is\nalways they say it never gets easier you\njust get faster so right and I think I\nthink it is especially difficult when\nyou know what what is coming I think\nthose are some of the hardest race um\nI've done serum number of years in a row\nif you're familiar with that that yeah\nsouth of uh de Mo in Cummings Iowa and\nuh I know what coming for the most part\nuh I know it's going to what what's\ngoing to happen and it it can be it can\nbe really\nyou know it can be really difficult this\nyear I think we thankfully got in before\nit got too hot and that was that was to\neverybody's benefit but it was still it\nwas still on the warmer side uh the\nwhole day which which I think can can\nmake anything difficult do you have it\ndo you have any techniques or anything\nthat you use to like do you have\nproblems with heat is that something\nthat you have to manage carefully um for\nsure I mean you know honestly it was\nwarm this year but I almost feel like at\nthe start it was almost a tad chil which\nwas really weird because it it did end\nup being warm but nothing that was um\nnot manageable manageable but uh I mean\nreally just making sure I'm hydrated the\nday before if I know it's going to be\nhot um just setting myself up for uh\nthat you know the day before making sure\nI'm getting electrolytes in uh and\nreally just make sure that's really all\nyou can do make sure you're eating you\nknow nutrition is big and it's hard for\nme when I'm racing hard to actually get\nlike solid foods in so I'm usually\nsticking like you know the gels and\nstuff like that so um uh that's just\nit's just been me though a lot of people\nlike my boyfriend prefers to eat actual\nfood so he'll eat Cliff Bars and stuff\nlike that and I I just can't seem to do\nthat during races but everybody's\ndifferent so yeah I I struggled with\nCliff Bars I think it's more the I like\noats like I love I love Cliff Bars in\ngeneral but actually writing I I\nstruggle a little bit with it and um I\ndo pry well with gels I do great with\nputting my nutrition in a bottle do you\ndo you do you do any nutrition in the\nbottle or do you stick to the gels yeah\nI've got the um the super fuel that\nscratch makes and I've used that a few\ntimes and that seems to to work really\nwell so um yeah if I can stick to just\nyeah hydration and fuel in the bottles\nthat's usually the way to go so that's\nusually what I try to do so can I tell\nyou about an experiment that I'm trying\nI'm curious what your thoughts would be\nwould you basically would you\nattempt this experiment is is my\nquestion so uh I was listening to the\ntrainer Road podcast not too long ago\nand they talked about how the Little\nDebbie Cosmic Brownies are like the\nprobably the most\ncarbohydrated dense snack food that you\ncan get caloric like most calories yep\nyep it's like 340 calories for a brownie\nwhich is my boggling yes I did not\nrealize there were that much either I\nwas like wow I didn't maybe it's 240 but\neither way like that's that's that's\nstill a lot for for what it is um I mean\nthat's that's more than a Coke you know\nyes yes it is so um so I bought three\nboxes of Little Debbie one of cosmic\nbrownie um zebra cakes\nand something else I forget what it is\nand so I'm gonna try that on on one of\nmy next big rides here not not at the\nbeginning I don't think I'm going to\nstart off with that um but would you uh\nyeah would you ever just go straight up\nstraight up junk food oh yeah for sure I\nwould for sure um maybe you know make\nsure it's not a a a ride or a race that\nuh you know I need to do really well at\nor something like that just to make sure\nthat that I can handle it but um I am\nnot a junk food uh I'm not against it so\num I like junk food you know I try to\nstay away from it but uh uh I would\ndefinitely be all about I think I asked\nyou to have the oatmeal cream pie or\nlittle what did I ask for for a Pisa\nthat was my request I thought so I\nthought it\nwas yeah I I I I prefer them Frozen Do\nyou ever do that oh never done that\nbefore personally I can't tell you the\nlast time I bought a box of any of those\nthings but I like to have them at the\nraces but yeah no that's good practice\nyeah yeah\nno I mean that that is that is one of\nthe the fun things about being in a\nsport like this where you got to you get\nto think about nutrition nutrition in a\nvery different way and fueling in a very\ndifferent way which I think is always\nkind of fun and\nexciting um I want to go back real quick\non one topic and then maybe uh you know\nsee if there's anything else that you\nwant to chat about but I wanted to talk\nabout the Nebraska Offroad series you\nlove mountain biking I've never done\nanything yet I have a fantastic mountain\nbike that sits way too often because\nwhat a shame just I know it's a total\nshame and it's a cross country mountain\nbike it's a really great I have Canyon\nLux it's fantastic and so I need to I\nneed to get I want to get out and and\nand try some of those but you know time\nbeing what it is tell me what give me a\nlittle bit of a rundown on the Nebraska\noff-road series from pretend I don't\nknow anything about it uh you know for\nour for our audience and and uh uh and\nwhat your experience was because what it\nsounds like is you did every race yep\nyep so there was there're supposed to be\nsix but branched o\nin July ended up getting uh I believe\nrained out um I think so um but it's\nlocal race series um starts in April um\nthey usually have one every month um\nthrough September and bunch of different\ncategories you have the you know the\ncross country category um you know if\nyou're cat 3 Cat 2 cat one um you know\nthey've got Junior races um they have a\nshort course which is just a obviously\njust like it says a shortened version of\nthe course um and it's all it's all the\nmain you know uh mountain bike trails uh\nin the area and so um but then the what\nI like to call the hardest category is\nthe\nmarathon uhh category which is uh three\nhours as many laps as you can get so um\nthat was my main goal this year was to\ndo all Races all Marathon category this\nyear and so\num I met my goal and I think I mentioned\nto you I I think out of all the\nparticipants I think I was the only one\nwho did actually did all five this year\nso um it's it's super tough and if you\ncan imagine I you know like you said you\ndon't a mountain bike but uh three hours\nat Lewis and Clark is is um hard so I I\nmean I can do three hours at Lewis and\nClark I'm not saying I'm moving the\nwhole time but Lewis and Clark is um uh\nfor those that that don't know is uh I\nwould call Le and Clark one of those\nroutes or one of those mountain bike\nareas where it wasn't so much as planned\nas it was like an evolvement as like\njust like just like mountain bikes\nevolved over time this was an area that\nlike a whole bunch of kids probably just\nwere messing around in the woods in an\narea making trails and then they're just\nlike well I guess this is the thing and\nthey like sanctioned it as a as a place\nbecause it does it is um Scrappy is that\nfair to say that's probably you know I\ndon't write there a ton um but it yeah\nit's it's got everything I I you know I\nthink there are certain sections of it\nthat are like they have a lot of um\ntechnical features and that you can\navoid and stuff like that but um I think\nduring that race I can't remember how\nmany laps I did but going up never rest\nmore than a few times in one ride is is\ntough so I think I did it at least four\nor five times but uh yeah it's it's a\nit's a hard it's a hard course and I\nactually think it's um I think it's the\nseries least attended uh course just\nbecause it is so difficult um so um I\ndon't know what the plans are for next\nyear if they're gonna gon to keep that\none or um or or what they'll plan to do\nbut uh it's it's it's a a tough race so\nit was hard very very hard so so what's\nyour strategy especially with a\nthree-hour effort I mean are are you\nokay with saying look I'm just gonna\nalmost like you know uh cyc across this\nsection I'm GNA plan on jumping off and\nand just footing it a little bit because\nit's not worth it or or do you really\ntry to stick to the saddle and and and\nuh use your gears you know I I just try\nto go as hard as I can during those as\nhard my body will let me um just because\nI you know it it was the Big Goal this\nyear and I did want to play SW and and\nand and do good um but uh yeah\nit's some races were really great Lewis\nand Clark didn't feel so great\nespecially when you went into it not\nreally wanting to do it because it's\njust I knew how hard it was going to be\num but yeah it it's just depends on the\nday too Tranquility is always a crazy\ncrazy hot hot race um um it was a little\nbit less hot this year but crazy humid\num and then if I remember right it\ndoesn't have it's it's fairly exposed\nthere's not a lot of trees at\nTranquility it's it's kind of on a good\nchunk of it's up on a the side of a hill\nthat I mean there's no trees it's just\nPrairie yeah Southside is very exposed\nand then they don't really do much of\nthe north section um but you know\nthere's the middle Nursery part but yeah\nI feel like a lot of it is is exposed so\nyou don't get a lot of that shade which\nis unfortunate but\num Swanson how do you what's where do\nSwanson rank on on it on like difficulty\nlevel or like just overall enjoyment\nit's the that's the place where I tend\nto it's fairly close to me again we're\ntalking about like Nebraska Omaha\nmountain biking scene which uh maybe\nisn't isn't super relevant to folks that\nare out in De Moine and and the Quad\nCities and Iowa City area but it's\nactually M Nebraska has some really and\nOmaha specifically this area has some\nreally great mountain biking that I\nthink people should check out so yeah\nwhere does Swanson rate for you Swanson\nis Swanson actually is funny because I\nthat's when I first started getting in a\nmountain biking like you know 2015\nthat's where I that's where I crashed\nand broke my collar bone but which is\nfunny to think back on it because to me\nSwanson or Tranquility are like if\nyou're just starting out those are\nprobably the two places to start um and\nthen Swanson is usually always the the\nlast couple years it's been the first\nrace of the series so it started in\nApril so that's usually when people are\nstill you know getting their Fitness\nback and what not but that's usually a\ngood place to start um just because it\nis um you know one of the least\ntechnical ones and and uh in terms of\nyou know difficulty level so um that's\nusually like a good a good one to start\nwith for the season so yeah and then\nwhat are the other two so was Swanson um\nMay was Calvin Crest out near Fremont\nwhich um is is that and plat are\nprobably my two favorite um and then\nJune was Lewis and Clark uh July was\nBranched Oak which got rained out um\nAugust was tranquility and then they uh\nthey ended the year with plat um and\nthat they synced that up with Thor Fest\nso they had Thor Fest and the plat race\nat the same time which was really cool\nso it was really cool and and Thor for\nthose that I I think Thor is National I\nforget but Trails have our respect is\nthe a group that manages a lot of these\ntrails in and around this area on the\nNebraska side and I guess I don't know\nhow much they do at Louis and Clark\nsince that's on the Iowa side but uh\nthey're a fantastic group as well they\nthey do a lot make sure the the trails\nare good um what what what was Trail\nwhat was Trail Fest like um I heard a\nlot of good things about it um it was\nreally great I think last year was kind\nof their first time doing it and um it\nwas\nuh just completely different this year\nthey were able to sync it up with like I\nsaid with the with the NS series which I\nthink was really great they had food\nvendors music um uh they actually\nactually um the plat race they usually\nalways have on the east side so it was\non the west side which um I feel is\num uh more flowy I mean you've got a lot\nof I mean you have a lot of long\ndescents with sharp you know\num uh uphill but um a little bit less\ntechnical than the East Side in my\nopinion um so uh but still difficult\nnonetheless so um yeah I I all I see is\nthat that event getting bigger and\nbetter every year so um they did a great\njob had had a ton of\nvolunteers um and yeah I hope they I\nhope they continue to kind of sync those\nthe NS race series with with the Fest at\nthe same time because it just made more\nof a reason to get out there and get\nmore people out there to watch which is\nalways nice so yeah that makes it that\nsounds really cool yeah um well uh Julie\nthis is I'm sorry Jesse I apolog\ncompliment I had I had two JS and uh\nyeah we hang out a lot so and ride bikes\na lot so you probably get that a lot and\nand I had I yeah I I had my notes up\nfrom our last chat up with juliean and\nso I read that the Jesse um it's been\nfantastic ftic chatting with you is\nthere I'm curious one thing that I\nalways like to ask and and I think I\nasked I don't know if I asked this last\ntime though because we had that that\nmore of that conversation about Prairie\nBloom and and things which is a\nfantastic episode go go search on\nYouTube or on our podcast for that uh\nthat was about a year ago um but given\nyou know we have another year another\nyear of understanding and growth and\nwisdom and experience all under our belt\nhere if you had a magic wand\nwhat is it that you would love to see in\ncycling whether it's Mount biking or\ncycl across or gravel or whatever what\nis it that you'd like to see um here uh\nin the cycling world if you just had a\nmagic wand that can make it happen more\nwomen racing period more women racing um\nyou know I feel like we were able to get\nmore women this year but um like even at\nplat it was there was only a few of us\nthere and uh I just it would just be\nnice to see more women out there getting\nmore comfortable um yeah I think that's\na big thing I would just like to see\nmore women in the in the sport racing\nand having a good time and know that it\nyou don't always need to win you don't\nalways you know easier said than done\nbut um it's really just a chance to get\nout there and and meet other cyclists\nand and uh you know if you get anything\nout of a race it's all you do is get\nmore fit so if if you know it's just\nanother opportunity to get a workout in\nand get more fit hang out with other\ncyclists so that's that's what I'd like\nto see for sure yeah awesome just and\nnow last question for sure you know yeah\nhow how would you know if you had too\nmany women in\ncycling is that gonna be a thing are we\nnot going to worry about that I don't\nthink I don't think we'll ever get there\nbut that would be really cool if they\nsurpass the number of men I guess\nmaybe like oh man I don't see that\nhappening unfortunately but that would\nthat would it would be cool to see it\nyou know the same same number of women\nracing as men but yeah we know we've\narrived there very cool cool well so\ngood to catch up with you I hope that uh\noh uh do you know what's your big I said\nit was my last question but I did want\nto get you're do you know what your big\na might be for next year what are you\nwhat are you\nconsidering you\nknow I don't know because all I can\nthink about next year is crusted but\nMonarch Crest mountain biking no racing\nI I you know I I mentioned to you too\nthat Julie and I said less racing next\nyear like less racing maybe one or two\ntwo two a month but um gosh I you know I\nwant to go back and I never thought I'd\nsay this I want to do spear fish again I\nwant to do Spear\nFish A lot of people know this but I\nactually cried during the\nrace it was that hard it was and that\nwas just like a small piece of it but I\nhad a little a little crash and and at\nmiles3 and you know for people that\ndon't know it's a 50 mile mountain bike\nrace I think it was around 6,500 feet of\nelevation um but I have never had that\ntype of emotion during a Race So I feel\nlike I need to go back next year and\nConquer it and uh yeah I don't know it\nwas like crying from just too many\nemotions it wasn't even really because\nof how hard it was but it was just yeah\na crazy race for sure I've I've been\nthere that's okay it's okay it's okay to\nhave a good\ncry so crazy I never had had that before\nI was like what is happening right now\nyeah it was nuts so well I hope that\nhappens and we get to chat more about it\nand you can tell me all about how you\nhad your pockets full of liby Little\nDebbie Oatmeal cream pies and how it\nfueled you to a fantastic finish at\nSpearfish because maybe that's maybe\nthat's what I was missing yeah I just\nneeded those Cosmic Brownies for sure\nyep well very cool Jesse thank you so\nmuch we will catch up with you soon yes\nthanks Chris all right bye\nbye"

Running is often the first endurance sport we fall in love with. Jen Sheffield describes herself as a runner at first, but I think you'll agree that by the end of this episode it's clear she's a diligent and competitive cyclist. We talk a lot about the joy and challenges of Albia Holy Cow and the Soldier Cutoff Hillduro in Pisgah, but dip into some other fun topics as well.",

had quite a journey she\nmay say that she started off and she's\nprimarily a runner but she is truly\ngravel through and through so I hope you\nenjoy this\nepisode all right everybody Welcome to\nthe Iowa gravel series Podium podcast my\nname is Chris McQueen I am your host uh\nand the series director of the Iowa\ngravel Series so excited to have you uh\nand we are of course always blessed to\nhave an amazing Athlete on these uh\npodcasts and this episode is no\ndifferent we have Jen Sheffield who\nrecently won I think if I'm right\ndefended her win for uh or or or\ndefended her Podium position on the Alia\nholy cow so she has been on the podium a\ncouple times there and so we're super\nexcited to chat with her Jen it is so\nwonderful to have you thank you thanks\nfor hosting as well Chris oh no no\nproblem so remind me I should know I\nknow I know this year you came in second\nwhat was your standing last year I was I\nwas third you were third okay all right\nso we've we've gone up we've gone up a\nposition yes and what's interesting\nthough is my time actually this year was\nslower than last\nyear so anyway well it was it was a\ndifferent course and we can we we\ndefinitely should talk about Alia and\nthe course because I am interested in\nthat but I wanted to start off a little\nbit just getting to know you so do me a\nfavor and for our audience and\neverything tell us a little about little\nbit about you like where are you from\nare you native to Iowa and then we'll\nget into the whole cycling thing yeah so\nyeah my name is Jen Sheffield um I have\nlived in Iowa since 2012 I'm a Nebraska\nnative I grew up\nabout 50 miles west of Lincoln so kind\nof the heart of gravel right like\nLincoln Nebraska um but I did not know\nanything about like gravel riding when I\ngrew up and went to school um 50 miles\nwest of there I went to college in\nLincoln Nebraska both my undergrad and\nmy graduate degree so I'm a physician\nassistant um I graduated from Nebraska\nwling from undergrad and then Union\nCollege for my physician assistant\ndegree and my first job out of school\nwas in atama Iowa and didn't know\nanybody moved to Iowa\num yeah and I actually I guess I should\nback up so getting to know me so so I\ngot into cycling\nin probably my undergraduate year so I'm\na runner like that's my that was that's\nmy heart my soul like that's where I\nthink my heart and soul will always be\nbecause it's like my first love that's\nwhat I always call running um do you\nstill run\nor or is that or is that going to change\nthe story does change the story okay\nthen we'll hold off on that you keep\ngoing you keep going you're originally a\nrunner I get it I've heard that before\nRunner I um started out doing like half\nmarathons full marathons just absolutely\nyeah like said it's just like my first\nlove when it comes to any of my sports\nAthletics um and then as every running\nlike I got injured so I had to do\nsomething else I had to get in the pool\nand I had to get a bike and so I bought\nmy my first like real road bicycle when\nI was in Lincoln at this bicycle shop\ncalled Joy Ride which is no longer but I\nhave a\njersey and uh anyway so that was my\nfirst road bike and I actually joined\nthe Cycling Club that was there and they\nwere they were Ries and so I got into\nlike roadcycling and then I found my\nlove for traon and I did Olympic\ndistance is the longest I've done I\ndon't know that I would ever want to do\nanything longer than that we'll see um\nbut yeah\ni' I've done a few triathlons and I\nthink for me the hardest part is the\namount of training it takes as you get\ninto it more and more because it's just\nit's a it's a lot of hours between brick\nwork individual work full full three\neverything so yes it's a second job it\nis it's it's a second job absolutely\nthird job for you\nChris fourth\njob um so yeah it is it's super time\nconsuming but um I can it's just you\nknow running running was really just my\nspace for mental health during college\nand my ability to to just cope mentally\nwith everything and so cycling kind of\nfell into that um but yeah I would say\ntraon was was kind of like my second\nlove because I I got into that I would\nhave gotten into that if I didn't get\ninjured as a runner and start cycling\nand um yeah swimming I just hate I'm\ndecent at it but I hate it like I hate\neverything about swimming it's inconen\nvenient it is totally inconvenient but\nanyway so um so yeah so anyway I moved\nto Iowa uh joined a multiport club in\natuma when I was got my first job as a I\nwas an internal medicine physici\nassistant which basically means I just\ntake took care of people 18 years and\nolder at that time and then ended up in\ndeine for a year and then have been in\nPella Iowa since\n2014 um currently Family Medicine\nphysician assistant here at P Regional\nlove it and then and yeah so then to go\non to gravel cycling I got into that in\n2021 yeah so it was like after the heart\nof the pandemic we saw all these people\non gravel bikes my husband is an\nengineer and he's like why would anybody\nwant to go and ride gravel like it's\ndirty and we grew up on gravel both of\nus grew up on gravel we were Farm kids\nand we're like why would you want to go\ndo that that's just like that's just\nlike terrible and\nthen we I don't I don't even know what\nprompted us we bought checkpoints we got\nboth of us got checkpoints and started\nwriting like this is really awesome you\ndon't have the traffic um there's not\nlike UCI stuff or like us Triathlon or\nyou know what I mean like you don't\nthere there's like none of that once I\nfirst first started doing some of the\nlike gravel racing um and the community\nwas really cool it seemed just you know\nlike traon is kind of a\nI'm not I think it depends on your\ncaliber and what you're doing but it's\njust a little bit different\natmosphere I mean if I had to I don't\nknow if I could compare triathletes to\nlike dogs and cats sort of thing I don't\nthink that's what it is but I think what\nit maybe if it was a dog breed it'd be a\nvery aype dog breed like you are you're\nyou're driven you're driven and you're\nyou're going to do the best and you're\nyou're you're in it to to to Really flex\nyour your your uh your prowess in\nmultiple fields and everything so I mean\nevery ath athletic uh sport I think has\nyour a types because I think that's\nwe're you know you're you're you're very\ncompetitive and that's that's great\ncompetition is fantastic but I think uh\ntriathletes are a fantastic example of\nthat uh and so that's yeah yeah it's a\ngood group yeah yeah and then just like\nwhen I would do the hve triathlon when\nhve was around like that Triathlon was\nreally awesome but you would see you\nknow everything from the pros and the\nHigh Caliber to you know everyday normal\npeople so anyway yeah so we got a new\ngravel in 2021 and yeah it's it's my\nkind of go-to cycling or it has been now\num just because you get to be out in\nnature you get to see stuff that you\nnever get to see on the road or on a\nbike trail there's nobody out there you\nsee like farmers who typically are\npretty nice and slow down and\nyeah like we love it we love it way more\nthan I ever anticipated that I would\never um love it and so actually then\nlast year at Pisa it was preparation\nPisa now it's Soldier cut off or\nwhatever it is um yeah the whole\nrebranding was an effort to yes I don't\nknow we we'll see how it goes yeah yeah\nso I was actually on one of the descents\nit was super Sandy and I was just going\ntoo fast and I could feel my back wheel\nslip out put put my foot down and I felt\nthe pop of my foot at the time I thought\nI had like ruptured my planner fascia\nand um lo and behold I actually ruptured\nwhat's called your peroneus longus off\nof my first bet of tarsel so like really\nthe arch of your foots where I ripped it\noff from and it it needed to be\nsurgically repaired and so I actually\nhad surgery August 29th I ruptured at\nthe 13th had surgery the 29th I was out\nfor nonweightbearing six weeks and\nanyway so I'm coming up on my year\nanniversary of that um that was life\naltering for me um in many ways so many\nways um any good ways or just just life\naltering in the fact that you're you're\nlike oh no I've now had a serious injury\nsort of thing like how how how what have\nyou learned from kind of trying to\nrecover from this injury because the\ninjuries are not fun injuries are are a\nwhole different uh competition or race\nif you will yeah so I should preface it\nwith like my problems overall are small\nbecause I totally recognize that what\nhappened to me is very small I'm I'm\nvery blessed in what I have so I'll\nstart with that but so yeah like I was\nsix weeks non weightbearing um I had a I\nhad several different like complications\nI ended up with this weird like bone\ncontusion in my fifth metatarsal head\nthat's not even related to my injury and\nthe surgeon really didn't know why and\nthey thought it was this thing called\navascular necrosis which is basically\nlike your bone just dies and we don't\nknow why but then I had a bone scan and\nit wasn't that and really it was just\nthis this bone contusion so think of it\nlike a bruise of your bone but really\nnobody could explain it to me and then\nthat got better like November December I\nwas and I could I couldn't do any high\nimpact until March 1 so six mon describe\nto me a little bit on like what your\nday-to-day looks like as you're injured\non this because you're saying non-weight\nbearing are you like in a boot are\nyouo in a in a boot on a scooter\ncrutches for six weeks and you know\nleading up to this like I I'm kind of\nnuts like I I would work out six to\nseven days a week I really did not allow\nmy body rest proper rest like I probably\nshould have um it totally is like you\nknow it's my drug whatever you want to\ncall it you know like that's my coping\nmechanism um it's where I go to just be\nin a space where I say where I just\ndon't have to make like Medical\ndecisions I don't have to worry about\nlike somebody's life is on the line like\nyou know it's just a place I can go put\nit all away and and so that all got\ntaken away right because you do that\nwhen you're six weeks not weightbearing\nand so I really honed my coping skills\nin life because you can't just put all\nyour coping skills in one basket that's\nproba what I did so what did you learn\nwhat where how did you cope um so I very\nmuch started addressing like you know\nI'm kind of a high functioning anxiety\ntype a person we talked about these\nTriathlon people right like I'm totally\none of them so um yeah I I've been\nworking actually with the University of\nIowa they have a sports clinical\npsychologist up there that has been\nsuper helpful at learning how to like\nhow do you mentally how do you train\nyour mental muscles as much as training\nyour you know physical muscles it's just\nlike Physical Therapy but it's physical\ntherapy for your mental health for your\nbrain your coping skills how do I cope\nwith anxiety when I can't go out and run\nwhen I can't go out and bike I can't do\nthe things I want to do and I would have\nnever done that right because like I\nwould have never done that that I not\nbeen injured and so um it's made me a\nbetter practitioner it's made me a\nbetter clinician um kind of just\nunderstanding like what our patients go\nthrough and you know hearing hearing\nnews that's super unsettling and being\nthe to go home with it instead of like\ngiving that to patients like I\nunderstand you know to a degree now like\nwhat's that what is that like you know\nand so may better definition overall I\nwould say what do you mean by that the\nthe giving it to someone else like what\nbreak that down for what what do you\nmean because I I kind of understand your\nrole a little bit I've been in a\nhospital I've had to work with\nPhysicians and and things like that but\nlike um the mental part of it and what\nyou're seeing and interacting with all\nday that that is that's that's that's a\nchallenge into itself so when you say\nbringing it home with you or not\nbringing it home with you what what do\nyou mean by that so like when I for\nexample we'll just say like I ended up I\nend up diagnosing a patient with cancer\nand I give them that news so for me as\nthe clinician when I give that news to\nthem you know I'm probably in the room a\nmaximum sometimes 20 30 minutes and then\nI move on you know I go on with my day\nbut that person goes\nhome and they have to they have to cope\nwith that and they have to figure out\nyou know and they have to go to sleep\nwith that they have to wake up in the\nmorning with that and so clearly mine is\nnot cancer I do not have cancer but you\nknow getting news of like well we don't\nreally know what's wrong with your foot\nand we don't really know like when it's\ngoing to get better or if it's going to\nget better you know and just being on\nthe receiving end of that was it was it\nwas horrible but it was really good for\nme at the same time because that gave me\nunderstanding and compassion that I\ndon't think I would have ever had you\nknow had it not been me in that position\nso I think I think that's I get that\nthat that makes a lot of sense and so I\nhave a question for you that kind of\ngoes a little bit deeper but then we're\ngoing to bring it back to to gravel and\nstuff a little bit so I'll ask you both\nquestions so we kind of know where we're\ngoing so my first question is how do\nwhat are some things that you've learned\nrecently about coping with the unknown\nor like being okay with that unknown you\nknow when you go home with news or\nthings so the the unknown is an\ninteresting topic to me and then I want\nto maybe see if we can flip that a\nlittle bit and go into this this topic\nof gravel and cycling and going into\nsomething because I know before we got\non the the call here we talked about how\nman one of the things that would always\nbe wonderful is to see more women in\ngravel so as we think about like going\ninto the unknown what are some things\nthat maybe we can learn there and and\nand and and learn from maybe your\nexperience getting involved with gravel\nand what you've seen and maybe we can\nmaybe we can explore that a little bit\nso tell me what you've learned a little\nbit about the unknown and how to handle\nit yeah so again I'm a super type a\nperson right I like to like control\nwhich is a which is like a mirage right\nbecause we think that we control\neverything and yeah we like totally\ndon't and so um just learning that\nacceptance doesn't equal failure I think\nthat's the biggest thing for me coming\nout of this is that just because you\naccept your situation your I mean insert\nwhatever you know problems as humans\nthat we deal with all the time that's\nunpredictable that that does not mean\nthat you're a failure that does not mean\nthat you're giving up and acceptance is\nokay and letting go is okay that does\nnot mean you're less of a person um and\nwhatever it is doesn't doesn't Define\nyou and so I think that's like my\nbiggest aha moment out of all of this is\nyeah just you have to acceptance does\nnot equal failure because forever that's\nwhat I fought is that like I am not\ngoing to accept this and it's like you\ncan accept it and continue to to to\nfight and to fight for whatever future\nyou want but you don't have to feel like\nthat's a failure and you have to give up\nyeah you can both move on and not feel\nguilt or shame or anger all these kind\nof more negative emotions just because\nyou can't do what you want to do because\nyou you know it's out of your control at\nthis point right things have happened\nand so you can control what you can\ncontrol which is your movement forward\nbut the the anger the anxiety the the\nsadness all those things it's okay to\nlet those go because they're not going\nto help you on your journey going\nforward anyway no and that the like I\nwould constantly look back and say well\nI want to be the old gen Sheffield and\nit's like but you can't you'll never be\nthat person again and you don't want to\nbe I think that's like the biggest thing\ntoo is that that person was great but\nlike you wouldn't be who you are and you\ndon't want to be that person you you\nwant to be who you are now because\nyou're stronger and you know this road\nhas led you to that and you're you're so\nmuch more stronger resilient and all the\nthings so yeah like trying to not fight\nfor your past and fight for your future\nand that's that kind of just goes along\nwith the acceptance piece of it so do\nyou hold any resentment for Preparation\npisga you know for a long time I was\nlike this was a horrible idea because it\nwas honestly a free\nentry and then I had to have surgery so\nit was like the most expensive entry um\nbut no I would say I I totally don't\nhold resentment um it was a freak deal\nright like um it just happened and so\nyeah I honestly have debated coming back\nto Pisa that's kind of my like I have\ntwo camps of like I want to come back\nand have Victory and really victory\nmeans for me just maybe not walking on\nmy bike and then there's the other piece\nof me that I'm like I don't know if I'm\nready to do it I I understand Pisa is a\nlittle and this is actually the reason\nfor a little bit of the re rebranding um\nbecause the Hebrew Hebrew word pisga\nmeans Summit which I liked I'm like okay\nthis is good and it's in pisga Iowa\nwhich has a very interesting colorful\nhistory as well um but uh Pisa is an\narea that I absolutely love but is first\nof all it is the only place in Iowa\nwhere I've ever had to go up a hill and\nthen up a hill and then up a hill like\nusually you go up a hill and then you go\ndown a hill and then you go up a hill\nand then you go down a hill that's how\nIowa works or Nebraska works but p is\ndifferent you go up and then you will go\nup more and then you go up more which is\nfun for me I grew up in the in the west\nso I like I like the climbing thing but\nalso the other part and I tell this\nstory a lot know Pisa is the only race\nor route where every time I do it and I\ndo the 138th\nTrail um my Garmin says congratulations\nyou have a new max heart\nrate and it's it is challenging but it's\nit's it's you know it's not a full\nCentury it's beautiful it's gorgeous in\nmy opinion but uh it is it's it's it's\nit's a different race than I think a lot\nof the other stuff that you see in the\nmidwest totally agree yeah the one Hill\nat the end like you said I don't know if\nyou've ever done Tom RAV the tour of the\nMississippi River Valley it's up in like\nNortheastern Iowa um so that has a hill\nthat goes up and up and up but it's on\nit's on concrete it's on you know like\non road bikes and so that's a totally\ndifferent that's a totally different\nball game than gravel but I we joke that\nit's like the Tom RAV of gravel with\nsand well the Sand's at the end not\nwhile you're going up usually so far and\nwe'll we'll see it really depends on\njust kind of like what kind of moisture\nwe got I mean last year was super super\ndry we're getting rain a lot uh right\nnow which will either mean we have a\ncrazy rded out roads or something\nbecause um Harrison County uh they\nmanage their classb roads just a little\nbit differently so so will we do you\nanticipate do we do you do we anticipate\nseeing do we anticipate seeing you in\nPisa in\nAugust stay tuned I I'm not I'm not sure\nyet um I'm actually looking at doing a\ntime trial potentially but I don't know\nyet I don't know yet we'll see that's\nfine that's fine we've got other races\nthat we'd love to have you on as well\nyeah um all right so let's let's shift\nthat then over into this topic and this\nis a common topic when we have uh female\nwomen Podium winners because um it it's\neverywhere I think it's I think it's\neverywhere in sports actually for the\nmost part is that you do have fewer\nwomen in sports in general there are\nobviously sports that are just women\ndominated you know I I don't want to be\ntoo I don't want to get in trouble by by\nnaming off a bunch of and then seeing\nsomeone say what ice skating isn't women\ndominated I'm like oh come\non who we're we're we all know what\nwe're going to watch um the uh but tell\nme a little bit about like your\nexperience\nuh and you know being in the field and\nseeing 50 men on the on the course and\nmaybe 10 women if you're lucky like and\nand maybe uh you're a little bit of\nyou're experience of like inviting other\nwomen like what what's been your\nexperience trying to to see how other\nwomen could get involved yeah so my very\nfirst gravel racing experience was the\npel ru in pel Iowa it was their first\nyear doing it so that would have been\nnot not this year but the year\nbefore and it was 30 to 40 m an hour\nwinds from the\nsouth um and the route first went went\nkind of South went in this like counter\nclockwise fashion around Pella and so um\nI remember showing up in it was in a\nchurch parking lot and I had no idea\nwhat to expect because I'd never done a\ngravel race you know was like my first\nyear with a gravel bike and you know\nI've got like my handlebar bag and I've\ngot my gas tank bag and I show up and\nthere is all of these men and they look\nlike they're seriously riding you know\nroad bikes with nothing on it and\nthey're kitted out and and there yeah\nthere's like five women there and I'll\nbe honest like I was very intimidated by\nthat I kind of didn't know what to do so\nI thought well I'll just kind of hang\nout in the back which was a terrible\nidea because you're by yourself then for\nthe whole gravel race anyway long story\nshort um I made it through the first\nlike 30 miles and then turned in with\nthe Tailwind to go up to suy Iowa and I\nwas like I'm going to ride this freaking\nTailwind man and just like you know be\nin my Max gear and I'm going to spin out\nand I'm going to go I'm G to go all the\nway up there because this is great um\nbut then yeah once I turned to try to go\ninto the headwind so I was like at Mile\n50 we still had 17 miles to go because\nit was like 67 miles and I was watching\nthere were some dudes in front of me\nthat actually got blown off so it was a\ncrosswind and they got blown off into\nthe ditch and I could barely keep my\nbike upright and I was like nope you\nknow what I I have had enough of this\nand it was actually my first dnf I've\never had in my entire life um but but I\nwas really happy that I went 50 miles\nand then actually I came back this year\nand I did they had a 30 mile route that\nI did and I was the only woman but I\nended up like taking taking you know\nfirst place because I was the only woman\nthat did it right but um I don't know so\nyeah that was and I remember kind of\nsitting on the start line thinking you\nknow am I doing here but now in\nhindsight it's like you know I think I\ndon't know if you had said this to me\nChris or it was your comment because I\nwas like I don't I don't feel like I\nbelong here and they I I think it was\nyou you were like you absolutely do\nbelong there and so I think that was\njust the the mindset of like yeah I do\nbelong here and you know more but but\nthen I think about other women that\nwould show up and have that experience\nlike it's hard you know it's hard to see\n40 men on the start line and then they\nlike take off going you know 20 miles an\nhour and so anyway but I would say when\nI went to you know I trained a whole lot\nmore and did Alia last year and I loved\nit like it was beautiful the course was\nbeautiful um the people were great you\nknow I just had more experience so I\ndidn't feel quite as\nintimidated um but yeah and then I would\nsay this year having now this will be by\nlike thought it was 20 21 22 23 like two\nyears into it um my goal really this\nyear I thought to myself I said I just\nreally want to stay with the men in the\nmid pack because otherwise I'm gonna end\nup by myself again and that really sucks\nbut I kind of blew myself up in the\nbeginning and ended up with leg GPS at\nlike mile 45 um but still ended up\nfinishing so um yeah so that's kind of\nmy I would tell women that like you do\nbelong there you do belong there and\ndon't feel like that you don't even\nthough it is really hard because you\nshow up and you're one of like nine\nwomen and you're looking at all of these\nmen that like I said um you kind of feel\nlike maybe you don't you don't fit in or\nyou don't belong there but you totally\ndo belong there yeah you do I for me\ngravel uh you know my ambition is always\nthat when if you looked across uh any\nsort of room uh or big group of people\nthat grapple would just kind of look\nlike that like I think that it's a sport\nthat is really attainable for both fit\nyou know both Fitness and adventure and\ncompetition and Community um it works\nbest when it has all those elements\ntogether um and and that that means that\nwe have to have like everybody there to\nkind of like remind us that this is this\nis what it is and um as I was as I was\nlistening to you uh I am I guess I had\nmaybe a couple couple questions the\nfirst was\num did you stay with the mid pack and\nhow was that drafting with did were you\nable to stay with a bit of a pack there\nand and and draft or or or stay with a\ngroup and work with a group um so I\nforgot that Alia the elevation and Hills\ncome so early they come right out of the\ngate and so there was one point where I\nlooked down I was trying to hang out I\nthink it was some of the Presto guys\nmaybe and I hung with them maybe maybe\neight miles or less but but um I looked\ndown at one point and I was going like\n20 miles an hour and my heart rate was\nlike 175 180 and I told myself I was\nlike you just can't be stupid this is\nbad like you can't you know you're at\nMile 10 this is not how you train and so\num I I they they totally took off up a\nhill and you know blew me away and so\nthat was kind of the end of it so I and\nI don't know that they were necessarily\nlike mid pack maybe they were like back\nor front middle I don't know but so yeah\nI tried I'm trying to remember if Chris\nNeely was part of presto or a different\ngroup there were some fast guys on\nPresto and there were some there were\nsome uh Presto's kind of an interesting\nuh Team uh because they they they have a\nthere were guys all over the the you\nknow the Spectrum I guess we we can say\nthere so yeah yeah so yeah no to to tell\nyou yeah so 10 miles I think is when I\ngot dropped but part of it was I just\ntold myself I can't I couldn't do that I\ncouldn't hold on at 20 miles an hour cuz\nmy my husband said he he could see my\nlive track and he saw my speed and my\nheart rate and he was like you have got\nto slow down and he was absolutely right\num that was but it was I kind of just\nhad gone out with like guns of Blazing\nI'm not gonna get left behind and then I\ngot left behind after Mile 10 for you\nknow whatever it was 45 m i mean one guy\nfor a while but anyway part of part of\nme like I've never I've never been a big\nhuge fan of the whole like UCI\ncategories sort of thing but there is\nsome maybe some utility to it because I\ndo think about like I think a lot of\nfolks would actually have a lot more fun\nuh doing gravel if they knew okay almost\nlike a like doing a marathon you know\nwhere they're like okay here's the Eight\nMile Pace here's a 730 Pace here's the 8\n30 Pace you know if if we could have a\nbit larger field and or when we have\nmore larger Fields being able to\ncategorize that a little bit and say\nokay you know what we know what we're\ngoing for we know what our pace is let's\nwork together because I mean cycling you\nyou get so much added efficiency\nbenefits way more than even running when\nyou can get in a team of folks and work\ntogether um it's and and that that's a\nlot of fun even on gravel you know\nsticking on someone's wheel or taking a\npull and and and and taking turn turns\num\nif done well and everything can be can\nbe a lot of fun and and really make the\nmiles fly by both just because you're\nworking and you have someone there with\nyou and you're and you're usually a\nlittle a bit more efficient so the whole\ngroup ends up being faster yeah because\nmy my husband said he's like it's not a\n62 mile time trial Jen it's not a 62\nmile time trial and you know because we\nwe love tto France we watch t of France\nand there's actually like a Netflix\ndocumentary that came out on that this\nyear and I guess I had I mean I had idea\nof the how much of a team sport it is\nbut I mean it that that's what it is\nit's totally a team sport you know none\nof those guys are going to make it to\nthe Finish Line without each other and\nso yeah so anyway that was and as a team\nthey've decided who's gonna win for\ntheir team for the most part and there\nwas a I think it was the third leg this\nyear or something like that where there\nwere two guys and one one guy was trying\nto get um uh best climber green jersey I\nbelieve and so he he he went on off the\nthe front with another guy and they\nworked the whole thing together not to\nwin the stage or anything but just\nbecause uh one guy wanted some more\npoints the other guy wanted to make sure\nthey secured his his climbing things and\nthe rest of the pelaton like we don't\ncare we don't care and they went off and\ndid their thing and and that that's fine\nand it makes me wonder I don't know\nbecause I one I'm not a woman I'm two\nI've never done this before but like\nwhat would happen if you got to a race\nand there were 10 girls there 10 Young\n10 women everything and you said\nhey what would you think about working\ntogether today do you think do you think\nthat would be scary to\ndo\num I actually thought about it this year\nbut\nthen I just I did I didn't do that I I\ndon't I don't think it would be scary\nbut I think it would be maybe you know\nif some of the women hadn't if you don't\nride in a pack that can be really kind\nof intimidating because you really do I\nmean part part of it too that's scary\nfor me is like I ride with my husband\nall the time so I know exactly kind of\nwhat he does what his body signals are\nand when you're on gravel it's not like\npavement you know there's you got to\npick your line and there's crap in the\nroad and so I do think that that's\npotentially a little bit more\nintimidating from that standpoint but um\nI wouldn't be I don't think now if I\nshowed up at a at a race and there were\n10 women I would I don't think I would\nbe afraid to say like hey do you guys\nwant to try to work together you know I\nI I I think I would be okay with asking\nthat\nquestion I I know I never met Linda\nCooper who took first place at Alia this\nyear but I know that she's she's a very\nactive racer and she's very strong and\nshe's been doing this uh a while and\njust great competitor so I hope I get a\nchance to to talk to her on the podcast\neverything but I do know Nancy bowry who\ncame in third and she has she is um the\nfirst group group that I ever started\nwriting with over here in Western Iowa\nwas a little tiny group just called the\nLim\nStoners and uh they uh uh uh Pat\nshowning and Chris MC oh shoot I'm\nforgetting Chris's last name anyway\nshout out to the Lim Stoners they're\nfantastic and we would just go around\nand do little group rides their goal was\nactually to ride every Road in the\ncounty that's what they wanted to do or\nit was one of the goals so we'd go a lot\nof crazy little places and do kind of\nfunky routes but that's how I met Nancy\nand she has uh grown as an athlete\nsubstantially and so I I do I look at\nthat and I go you know you and Nancy\ncould have very well maybe working\ntogether could have maybe closed quite a\nbit of a gap on Linda uh just just\nputting that out there into the universe\nas a as an option so I for me I'd love\nto see those things happen for sure yeah\nno I uh Linda actually has done the pel\nru here twice and she's you know taken\nPodium number one both times and like\nit's a beast of a course um just because\nit's in April too so you have no idea\nyou know like this year it was freezing\nfreezing cold and like you know Linda\nI'm pretty sure hangs out with some of\nthe lead dudes in the pack like in in\nthe front of the pack or you know\nsomewhere up there and so anyway yeah\nlike\nI uh I I think I would defin I don't I\ndon't know how old Linda is for sure but\num definitely would want to be her as I\nmove up in the\nMasters you know\nMaster yeah well and there was another\nperson uh Heather uh that was on the\ncourse and the I mean I think you passed\nher or she she was in front of you guys\nfor a while and then you ended up\npassing her because I think she got a\ndouble flat is what I heard is that\ngoing through the class B section in\nSteven State Forest that there was a\nsteep down hill and then it went across\na dry River Crossing or stream Crossing\nit wasn't very big but it had larger\nrocks in it which is unusual for Iowa\neven finding large rocks can be tricky\nbut she apparently hit that and just oh\nso unfortunate double flatted going\nthrough it and I think that slowed her\ndown quite a bit and I think that you\nand Nancy ended up passing her uh after\nthat I don't know if that's true but\nthat's that's kind of what I thought\nhappened um I don't ever remember seeing\nHeather so I actually I passed um Linda\nshe got a flat Linda had a flat at some\npoint she had her bike upside down and\nso I passed her going on a level B and I\nremember in my head thinking I was like\noh my gosh I just passed Linda and I\nthink that was probably you know I\npushed pushed pretty hard up until mile\n40 five and then that's when I blew up\nI've never had leg cramps like I had\nthis year that's kind of another thing\nI'm trying to figure out if it's just\nyou know I've been kind of not off for a\nyear because I've really been training\nhard since I've been cleared to cycle\nbut um it was going up the second steep\nclimb that was on our Garmin like the\nthere was like two climbs left and I\nreally had no warning both like my quads\nand my hamstrings both completely\ncramped and I got off my bike and here's\nLinda she comes up up this steep ascent\nand she stops and she was so sweet she's\nlike oh my gosh are you okay and I was\nlike no absolutely not I am not okay and\nthere's nothing you can do for me and\nshe's you know she's like do you need\nsome electrolytes and I'm like no I have\ndrank more than I I know what to do it\nand you know I just I just really had to\nlike walk I had to walk it off and but\nshe was so nice stopped and then she got\nback on her bike and I start her take\noff and I was like oh my\ngod um kind of felt you know demoralized\nat that point in time but um but\nyeah I you're still in second place\nyou're still you're still you're still\nin the game but yes I I hear that and\nand cramps are cramps are definitely one\nof the the worst things right I I know\nwhat to do with my back hurts I know\nwhat to do with my stomach well stomach\nissues and GI issues I think can be\nequally uh frustrating and I think maybe\nthey're all kind of connected but you\nknow certain injuries and stuff you're\nlike okay there's a plan I know what we\ncan do but cramps everybody's different\nlike the the medical world as far as I\nknow and I only listen to like the\ntrainer Road podcast or things like that\num it it just depends there's there's\nsome things that that they kind of know\nand they know electrolytes and and uh\nand sugars and uh and and making sure\nyour sodium and everything are are there\nand and kind of that pH balance but like\nwhat might send a muscle into just\nwanting to uh uh fire you have it's an\nelectrical system problem and and what\ncan cause that is very tricky to find to\nfigure out yeah I actually read I read\nsome research articles on it because I\nwas like what the hell you know this is\nridiculous and I'd never you know the\nonly time I'd ever had it is I actually\ndid the beatric has a has a gravel the\nsolstice gravel which is that's an\namazing by grade too but it was 104 like\n105 degree heat index and I I didn't get\nuntil like one mile in the finish line\nso I gave myself some Grace with that CU\nI was like okay that was totally\nterrible you know like totally hot um\nbut this was Alia was beautiful you know\nlike the weather was gorgeous I had\ndrank and ate\nappropriately um but yeah the research\narticles I had read basically said like\nwe don't really know I mean it could it\nit can be electrolyte disturbance but\nthey said yeah it's like this electrical\nmalfunction that you're having a seizure\nof your muscles and you just don't have\ncontrol over it and the only way to get\nrid of it is like stretching and and\nlike stopping what you're doing\nessentially so anyway but yeah that was\na new one for me um this year never had\nthat happen before\nyeah I've had a I've had I've had cramps\nvery rarely and they've never been so\nsevere like what happened when I I was\ndoing a big 130 mile uh just a ride with\na buddy in the Bay Area and it started\nhappening and I think I was so tired and\nit because it wasn't a race and all I\nwanted to do is just kind of beat my\nbuddy like I I just it was it just made\nme laugh I was sitting there just\nlaughing at my legs you know shaking and\nstuttering and I'm like I'm not\ncontrolling that that's kind of fun\nthat's kind of interesting but it wasn't\na it wasn't a competitive environment\nwhere you're trying to get stuff done\nsort to so to speak so it's it's up a\nhill up a hill up a hill right well okay\nthis has been fantastic Jen I've really\nenjoyed this and I think we've explored\na lot of really uh fun things and and\nsome ideas especially\nI I I'm I'm going to challenge more and\nmore women to keep inviting women\nbecause I want them I I want to have a\ngood strong field for you but also I I\nthink uh we need to personally I I'll\nput you know my my little Soap Box I\nthink the biggest invite that I would\ngive to women in the gravel area is\nfreaking just work together because you\njust don't be afraid to work together\nand I I think that might be I don't\nmaybe maybe I'm out of line but I I\nthink that's something that uh I would\nencourage more more totally so yep so\nI'm curious then kind of as our wrap-up\nquestion here um if you had a magic wand\nand we've talked about women and\neverything but anything anything you\ncould just magically wave a wand and\nthis could be gear this could be\nindustry this could be uh you know the\ncommunity anything that if you could\njust magically wave a wand and it and it\nwould change and you think for the\nbetter what would you do would be\nsomething as far as gravel goes right\nwell Fitness I guess but yeah at least B\nbicycle sort of stuff I I think you know\nyeah doesn't have to be graveled per se\nbut um I would\nsay I guess just for my experience like\nI said when I showed up and being\nintimidated that you know you like you\ndon't you don't need to have a quote\ngravel bike to do this and you don't\nneed expensive gear and\nyou know like if you have a mountain\nbike like you can go ride gravel or you\nknow vice versa if you have a road bike\nyou can you can go to a triathalon you\ndon't have to have like a tri bike to go\ndo it and so I guess I would say if I\ncould wave a magic wand\nthat yeah I would take I guess kind of\ntake that piece away of it and maybe\nmore maybe more women feel that way just\nbut because I'm I'm a woman and I've\nbeen in those situations where it I\ncould see where somebody would be like\nyeah I don't want to do that because\nthat's intimidating and I don't have\nthis the right gear and the right stuff\nand so yeah I guess I would say yeah\njust waving that wand to not be afraid\nto just you know go do it and try it\nwith what you have versus trying to feel\nlike you have to you know buy into this\nreally expensive stuff to be able to to\ndo it because like you don't have to you\ncan get on your bike and go ride and um\nyeah and I think too just somehow with\nand maybe I just need to do more gravel\nevents too but um having the the women\nkind of work together to make it this\nkind of yeah like let's be a team\ntogether like yeah we're com competition\nwith one another but we all love each\nother and we really want you know us to\nto kind of be a community because that's\nreally what gravel I've noticed for me\nis just it's this kind of really neat\ncommunity that comes out of it um and so\nyeah just knowing the opportunity is\nthere if you want it and you don't have\nto feel like you don't belong because\nyou do belong you do belong it's\nabsolutely true yeah well Jen you are\nfantastic thank you so much for your\ntime tonight this has been amazing so um\nappreciate all you do looking forward to\nwhatever next race you choose to show up\non in the uh Iowa gravel Series so thank\nyou so much for tonight absolutely thank\nyou for your time too Chris all right\nwe'll catch you soon\nthanks"
