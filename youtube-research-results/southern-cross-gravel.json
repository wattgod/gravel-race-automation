delonga Georgia starting and\nfinishing in the beautiful montal luche\nWinery if you believe that Georgia is\nflat ha well this event will change your\nmind pretty quickly North Georgia is far\nfrom Flat in fact part of this route\ntraverses at least two gaps AKA long\nclimbs that will challenge your climbing\nlegs in addition to that some\nchallenging descending thrown in as well\nand more than likely there'll be some\nhiker bike at least to start with and\npossibly to end with a great event\nchallenging tough plenty of fun details\nare linked in the description below next\nup the hill hole gravel grind held in\nFrancis Marin State Forest aka the OG\nthe first legitimate gravel stage race\nheld in the United\nStates I have not ridden this event\nmyself but a couple of my mates have

with the timed proceedings\nnow if a gravel stage race isn't your\nthing you can ride two stages Grand\nFondo style at your own riding speed\ndetails are linked in the description\nbelow next up another Series this time\nin North Carolina hosted by pisar\npromotions aka Mr Eric Weaver and his\nteam of volunteers good day Eric if\nyou're watching there are two gravel\ncycling events in this series pis gar\nmonster cross this event inspired me to\ngo out and build a drop bar mountain\nbike way back in 2013 just to deal with\nthe rather dodgy descent you are likely\nto encounter this event this was way\nbefore any current gravel Pros had ever\nthought of such an idea no disrespect to\nthe great Charlie Cunningham or John\nTomac for that matter P monster cross is\none of the early OG events particularly\nin North Carolina adding to that Madness\nthis is the boot Lego 100 another tough\ngravel cycling event featuring the\nlovely Maple Sally road that goes up and\ndown up and down and you'll think winds\nare going to end but the scenery is\nspectacular details of the series is\na Tennessee event the gravel Revival of\nHickman County which is not too far from\nNashville Tennessee if you seek yourself\nsome dirt salvation the gravel Revival\nis worthy of your consideration it's a\n3-day gravel cycling Festival\nspectacular unfortunately I've not\nattended yet but I'm hoping to change\nthat in 2025 maybe I'll see you there\nwhat's not to love Expo challenging\nriding fun times learn more at the link\nin the description below next up another\ngravel series and this one's been around\nfor quite a long time in the fine state\nof Mississippi the Mississippi gravel\nCup hosted by those trend setters Jason\nand Wendy sheir this unique series\nfeatures four events starting in four\ndifferent towns in the state of\nMississippi unfortunately I have not\nridden any of Jason's events but I have\nridden in many of the areas that his\nevents feature fantastic scenery

about\n105 mil there are about 30 Mi of gravel\nroads on the 100 plus mile distance this\nis a challenging event if you like\nracing this is one that you should\nseriously consider I've had the pleasure\nof racing this event three times and\nI've had great luck where I managed to\nsomehow score top five in Masters when I\nwas a wee bit younger and I've had bad\nluck where I had flat tires dodgy legs\nand all sorts of goodness that\naccompanies a day on the bike where\nthings don't always go so well but that\npoint aside this is an event as I\nmentioned very worthy of your\nconsideration and hard-earned money ride\nthe tuna Hills of rouge Ru Bay further\nbelow rodo Trend Setters that wraps up\nthe list for now without doubt there are\nsome events that I've missed some events\nthat are no longer operational feel free\nto leave a respectful comment below if\nyou think there's an event worthy of\nmention keep in mind the event should be\nGrassroots as we like to call it around\nhere so it shouldn't cost a lot of cash\nand ideally give back to the local\ncommunity in some way shape or form\ncoming soon I'll be covering other areas\nof the United States so stay tuned for\nthat and potentially outside of the\nUnited States as always thank you for\nwatching if you haven't already please\nconsider subscribing to the gravel\ncyclist YouTube channel for
