      "transcript": "Gravel racing in steamboat feels\ninsanely fast.\nEvery gravel race is so so hard.\nThe altitude's a beast.\n[Music]\nWe got some of the fastest riders here,\nsome of the top riders. We started out\nhot\nin gravel racing. Always there's the\npotential that things can go south\npretty fast. Those climbs were just\nkiller. There were several Oh\ntimes.\nSBT gravel red course riders. We are one\nminute out from a long day out here on\nRoute County Road. Enjoy your day out\nthere. Let's get ready to have some fun.\nSPT Gravel has been one of those events\nthat's always just grabbed my attention.\nThe gravel is unique. The place is\nbeautiful and you just can't help but\nenjoy riding your bike.\nHistorically, Steamboat Gravel with its\nchampagne gravel is a fast course.\nIt's just this fine little pebbles or\nthe bubbles in champagne. It's It's\nfast. It's so fast.\nSBT gravel is an event that takes place\nover 4 days. So, the first two days are\nan expo.\nSaturday is our ride day. So, there are\nthree course distances. The blue course\ngoes first. That's the longest distance.\nThat's a 100 miles. The red course goes\nsecond. That's approximately 55 mi. And\nthen the green course goes and they are\n37 mi. And on Sunday we have our race\nthat's for both amateurs and\nprofessionals.\nGravel is meant for the masses. And it's\nmeant to be a challenge for yourself.\nYou know, you do it with your spouse,\nyour your kids. It is that shared\ncamaraderie of being out on the course\nand just trying to see what you're\ncapable of. I'm just out here to have\nfun. I don't really have a strategy, I\nguess, especially with my dad.\nThere's just people from like all walks\nof life. They're so well represented\nhere at SPT. I really appreciate coming\nback to Steamboat because the entire\nteam um have done a really good job of\nfocusing on inclusion um and diversity\nwithin the sport. I really appreciate\nthat they figured out a way that we can\nall coexist together.\nWe're here at the start and feeling\nreally good. 900 riders. So, it's a good\nday in the valley here.\nI was getting nervous this morning, too.\nIt's race morning nerves or you don't\nreally know what's going to happen. So,\nit's the adventure that's out there.\nStart out slow and just see how the day\ncomes. See how you feel. #not dead yet.\nYes.\nGood morning. We are on the start line\nof SBT gravel. This is the blue course.\nThat's a 100mile ride here in route\ncounty. 1,800 riders here. They're about\nto kick off.\n5 4 3 2 1. We are off and rolling here\nat SBT Gravel 2025 presented by Wahoo.\nCome on.\nMy name is Isabelle King. I go by King.\nThis is my fifth year racing as a pro.\nAnd my year looks a little bit different\nthis year because I am 8 months\npregnant.\nWhat makes this year's Steamboat Gravel\nspecial is that I get to do the race\nwith my mom. We're doing the green\ncourse, which is a 37 milei route. How\nyou feeling, mom? Great. Great. Just a\nfew butterflies, but that's good. That's\njust about right. My mom has never done\na bike race before, period. Much less\ngravel off-road. So, uh, Saturday will\nbe an adventure. I think the biggest\nchallenge is you always want to make\nsure you're being safe. I think in the\nback of your head, the risk that\nsomething goes wrong, you feel like a\ncomplete idiot. Um, if you do something\nand something bad happens, like her\nsafety is is the most important.\nWelcome to the party.\nIt's going pretty well. Five mile climb\nthat we just did. That was great. This\nis a thousand foot climb which is bigger\nI think than you've ever done. The one\nwashboardy downhill with a lot of people\npassing, you know, um because they just\ngot excited. Yeah, that was a little a\nlittle scary, but otherwise, no, it's\nbeen great. Can't imagine being in a\nbetter better conditions for a first\nrace. Now we have the last little\ntechnical section and we'll roll to the\nfinish. You forgot to tell me about the\nlast little technical. I did. It's been\ngreat. Glad you got me to do it.\nYeah, we got a little special\nfor you. What do you want to tell your\ndaughter one day about this race?\nI think you hope to make her proud. Um,\nI think you just hope to make\nthe world a little bit of a better\nplace. Um, so that when she comes into\nthe world that it's a little bit easier\nfor her. That was awesome. I think that\nwas probably the best we could have\nasked for. It was really fun. No\ncrashes, no mechanicals, no flats, no\ncramps, no labor. Everything's good.\nI am a big black man on a bike. I am\nfrom Brooklyn, New York. I look like an\nNFL linebacker.\nSeeing me shows others that it's\npossible. You can be here as well. It's\nnot something that's locked off from\nyou.\nMy name is Casey Duncan. I ride for\nDadbot Cycling, Inc., a 501c3 charity.\nThe money goes to donating bikes to\nchildren in the inner city. Dadbot\nCycling started really with a\nquestion/suggestion.\nHey, let's let's buy bikes. We were\ngetting a little older. It was too much\nto play basketball and football anymore.\nSo, I was just looking for an\nalternative to stay in shape. The goal\nis to motivate people and show people\nthat, hey, I have three kids and I'm\nable to do it. You can do it as well.\nSo, my first SBT gravel was in 2023. I\ngot involved with Ride for Racial\nJustice. They flew us out here. It was\nmy first time ever on gravel and it was\nmy first gravel event. It was hectic.\nThis will be my third time. The first\ntime was rough, but I finished. The\nsecond time was rougher, but I didn't\nfinish. This time the goal is to finish\non two feet, happy, healthy, and\nsmiling.\nFinishing it the third time definitely\nerased all the negatives from the first\ntwo. I just wanted this to be the\nperfect one. I wanted this to be the\nboring story where nothing happened. I\nstarted, I finished, and it was just\nperfect. Dadbod's working out.\nSaturday was a huge success. We had\n1,800 riders aged 8 to 82. They came\nfrom 14 countries and 49 states. We\nkicked it off here on Yampa Street at\n6:30. Finished up at 5:30 p.m. Saturday\nwas an incredible day. Good shot. Finish\nright there. We are really looking\nforward to Sunday. These professional\ncyclists for some of the best cyclists\nin the world and we're really excited to\nsee how that unfolds.\nWelcome to 2025 SBT gravel race day. We\nare here in Hayden, Colorado, about 25\nmiles outside of Steamboat Springs. It's\na beautiful morning. New this year,\nwe've separated the race and the ride.\nSo, Saturday is our ride day and Sunday\nis our race day. That's for both\namateurs and professionals. We've never\ndone that in the past. The course is 37\nmiles and the amateurs do that circuit\ntwo times and the pros do that circuit\nthree times.\nWe are here at the start line of the SBT\ngravel race and first off our amateur\nracers. We have the gravel fe, the age\ngroupers and the juniors. All of those\ngroups are doing two laps. That's just\nunder 80 miles. Right after the amateurs\nwill be the pro men, pro women have\ntheir own start and they're doing three\nlaps as well. Hardest part of the race\nis waiting for the gun.\nI'm feeling the energy.\n5 4 3 2 1 We are off.\nNew this year, we also opened up a\ncategory for parasycling who will roll\nout with the amateurs.\nMy name is Dr. Meg Fischer. I have a\ndoctor in physical therapy. I've been to\nthe Parolympics twice. I have a gold,\ntwo silvers, and a bronze. I also own 12\nworld championships. On Sunday, the race\norganizers have made some decisions and\nhave the pair of athletes racing two\nlaps.\nMy freshman and sophomore year in\ncollege, I was involved in a rollover\ncar accident. Um, my first girlfriend\nand I, we were driving cross country.\nShe was my first love. And, um, halfway\nthrough our drive, our car rolled eight\nand a half times and Sarah died. I woke\nup a week later from my coma. My foot\nwas gone and my heart was broken. They\nkept telling me what I wouldn't be able\nto do. For calling somebody disabled, we\nare telling them with our words that\nthey are not able. And I find that to be\ndisempowering. All these things that\npeople told me I couldn't do like you\nyou'll never be as good as you were. You\nwon't be able to walk. Keep your\nexpectations low. Every time somebody\ntells me I can't do it, I show them that\nI can.\n5 4 3 2 1 track team leaders. They are\noff and roll. This is your pro field.\nThey'll be out there for three laps of\nhard racing today on this incredibly\nchallenging course. It's plenty of\nelevation gain.\nMy name is Keegan Swinson. I'm the\ndefending champion of SBT. The biggest\nthing this year is, you know, we're\ndoing a circuit race. Um, and we're\nstarting down in Hayden. I think it'll\nrace well. Um, it'll be really fast. I\nmean, hard to say, you know, see how the\nrace plays out and see who's, you know,\nkind of willing to ride early. It also,\nI think it the win could be a big factor\nout there. I think it's going to be kind\nof a race of attrition as well as a\nlittle bit tactical. Every year it's\nharder and harder. You come to race,\ncome to race to win.\nMy name is Alexi Verm\nand most well known as being Willy's\ndad.\nAnd then secondarily to that, um, one of\nthe gravel pros in the US,\nthere's a lot of strong guys all around.\nUm, but I I think everyone always points\nat Keegan. Stand up can be strong. Ian\nBoswell, but it's it definitely has to\nbe their day a little more cuz I think\nwith this course, it's probably going to\ncome down to a small group sprint. When\nI look at this course, I think it is the\nstrongest person wins.\nI am Ted King. I'm a professional\ncyclist. 2019 was the first year. I had\ngreat success there. I won the event. My\nstrategy is to survive the altitude. The\naltitude's a beast. We're racing up\nabove 7,500 ft. I mean, I'm here to\nembrace the race. I would love to do\nwell, but I'm also a realist. So, if I\nfind myself in a winning breakaway, I\nwouldn't be surprised if I find myself\ngasping for air and watching a recruit\nride away. I won't be surprised by that\neither.\nAll right, Alicia. on the line is this\nincredible filled out absolutely\noverflowing with talent. We're excited\nto be here at the SBT gravel with the\nwomen's separate start and we're going\nto be racing today with a team of three.\nSo, we're excited to see how that goes.\nMy strategy is\ntake it as it comes. Feel it out.\nI'm Lauren Deenzo, better known as LDC.\nI've won SPT um two times. Kind of a\nroadie who found their way to the\ngravel. In 2016, I suffered a nearly\nfatal traumatic brain injury at a road\nrace in Southern California. When my old\nteam director called my dad um the day\nlike immediately after the crash, he\nsaid, \"Get to California right now. We\ndon't know if she's going to make it or\nnot.\" Getting over the fear though is\nstill something that I struggle with and\nI always will. My doctors had advised\nnot to do this, but I love it and I just\nmakes me happy and I, you know, they're\nnot going to tell me to return to\ncycling, but I did and here I am. It's\ngoing okay.\nI don't ever line up not wanting to win\na bike race. So, yeah, I'll do whatever\nI can in the race to make it happen.\nWhat's approximate time for pro? Looks\nlike about 1:20.\nHere\ncomes one rider. And that one rider is\nit stars and stripes. Who do we have?\nLet's keep an eye.\nThat could be Brandon coming through\nright here. He's looking behind the\nfact. I think this our pro men's winner\nright here. Let's make some noise.\nHere comes right here. Here it is. Three\nriders. Keegan\ncoming in second. Kobe Freeird with that\nthird place. And Alexi Vermuin coming in\nfourth.\nSunday was incredible. The pro men's\nrace was really exciting. Eventually, it\nwhittleled down to a group of five men.\nAnd Brendan Wartz is a power rider and\ntook the win. That was just in front of\nKeegan Swinson, who is a former SBT\ngravel winner. And in third place, Kobe\nFreeburn. Fourth place, Alexi Vermuan.\nAnd fifth place, Pete Stetta.\nthey are. They're charging hard. I think\nthis is it. Make some noise. Here come\nyour leaders. The woman in blue\ncycling. There's your number two for\nracing. Rider number nine. The women's\nrace was incredibly dynamic. It was won\nby Melissa Rollins. She was also the\nwinner of Leadville last year. So, we\nknew she was strong and she pulled out\nthat win in a final sprint. Just behind\nher was Lauren de Cresenzo and she is\nalso a two-time winner of SBT gravel.\nLauren Stevens took third. In fourth\nplace, we had Sarah Lang. And fifth\nplace, Pay John Weller.\nSBT Gravel presented by Wahoo was\nanother great success.\nWe split the format up into two separate\ndays and two separate towns. What we\nmaintained is that inclusive race that\nappeals to the world tour pro all the\nway to the brand new cyclist. You\ncrushed it. Anybody can start at any\nage. I just turned 56. It doesn't\nmatter. You can start. Just do it.\nCouldn't be more proud.\nWe would absolutely say the SBT gravel\nis about ordinary people doing\nextraordinary things on bikes in\naddition to extraordinary people doing\nextraordinary things on bikes. Gravel is\na leap of faith, but let me impart the\nknowledge to you that once you've made\nthat leap, it is an absolute blast.\nSteamboat Gravel put a big emphasis on\ncommunity. I feel really lucky that we\nget to come here and so I take it very\nseriously to be a good shepherd and a\ngood ambassador for this sport because\nthis community means the world to me and\nI know it means the world to the SBT\nteam as well and we're already looking\nforward to 2026. I can't wait to come\nback. I can't wait to see who comes next\nyear.\nI'll be another year older, but I'm\ngoing to give those whippers snappers a\nrun for their money.\nI will be back to SBC Gravel next year\nand the next year and the next year and\nstill forever."

      "transcript": "We are here at SBT Gravel presented by\nWahoo and the greatest gravel roads on\nearth await.\nRiders and racers from all walks of life\nhave journeyed to Steamboat Springs and\nHayden, Colorado this weekend to get a\ntaste of the route county champagne\ngravel.\n[Applause]\n[Music]\nFrom\nthe gravel expo that we kicked off on\nThursday to all the activities on Friday\nin Shammy Butter Park, from yoga with\nOldtown Hot Springs, toddler race with\nAlpine Bank, all kinds of activities for\nfamilies and children and everyone here\nto participate in.\nOn Friday night, we capped things off\nwith the Canyon Hill Climb at Howison\nHill, and everyone was in costumes with\nproceeds benefiting friends at the cycle\neffect. It was serious fun.\nGood morning. We are on the start line\nof SBT gravel. This is the blue course\nthat's about to kick off now. That's a\n100mile ride here in route county. 1,800\nriders here that are about to kick off.\nThis is a different format. This is\nthree different courses of riding today.\nIt's going to be a great day today in\nSteamboat Springs. Ride in the blue, the\n99. Feeling great. Super stoked. Lots of\ncoffee and a little chilly, but ready to\ngo. But feeling good. It should be a\nbeautiful day out there in uh in Austin\nSeabo Springs.\nI dare you dig a little deeper.\nIt makes you feel a little stronger.\nWho knows what you may find? You'll see\nin your own time. It might just take a\nlittle longer.\nIt all goes by so slowly.\nOoh.\nYou waited your whole life. Your days\nturn into nights.\nNow let the river flow.\ndeep into the ocean.\nYou know the ocean.\nCan you hear it? It goes by so slow like\na solitary. I crushed it. I beat my time\nthat I set for myself by 30 minutes. Got\nthat champ gravel. We got some stuff. No\nmatter what our pace, we're going to do\nit together. So whether we're feeling\nstrong, we're feeling we're going to be\nable to pick each other up and get each\nother through the finish line no matter\nwhat. And I think for the 70 of us who\nsigned up for this, it's support, you\nknow, supporting each other and building\neach other up and encouraging more women\nto to dare to do the hard stuff\ntogether.\nWe are out here in Hayden, Colorado,\nabout 25 miles outside of Steamboat\nSprings, kicking off our SBT gravel race\nday. First off, our amateur racers. We\nhave the gravel fe, the age groupers,\nand the juniors who will start now. All\nof those groups are doing two laps.\nThat's just under 80 miles.\nI was looking at my Guah computer and I\nwas like, \"Please show me where it's\ngoing to crest.\" And this gal pushed me\nover the hill. And I'm just really happy\nto be here.\ndoing three laps as well. It's going to\nbe a fun fast day out there.\nSuper excited to see how the first ever\nwomen's only\nthe same kind. The desire you feel isn't\nthe same as mine. I could let you go,\nbut why should I? You're my mission.\nYou're on my mission tonight.\nHeat.\nI'm\nI definitely had to kind of mitigate\nsome of my weaknesses at points on some\nof the steep climbs. I was with, you\nknow, some of the the fastest gravel\nclimbers, altitude climbers in the\nworld. So, uh, yeah, I definitely had to\nbe a bit conservative on the climb, but\nthe rest of the course, 90% of it really\nplayed to my strengths. So, yeah, just\nconserve, save something for the final\nand give it a couple of goes in the end.\nYeah, super proud of that one. Brenon\ntime that last attack really well. Um,\nyou played the card I had, which was\ngoing all in that last low climb, but\nthe I just, you know, couldn't get any\nseparation with the headwind and, you\nknow, Brennan launched a nice attack on\nthe descent and we just couldn't get him\nback.\ngot hot on that last lap. But yeah, we\nwere moving really well together, the\nfour of us. And yeah, I didn't know how\nI was going to shake out in the end. I\ncramped just before the last kick and I\nwas like, \"No.\" But then I came around\nand I think everyone was hurting. Oh my\ngosh. And Lauren caught me on the\ndescent and I thought it was over, but\nYeah, we were able to work together just\non that last, you know, minute into the\nfinish. And oh my gosh, I can't believe\nI pulled it off.\nIt was really fast. It was really,\nreally hard. Not much drafting. You're\nalways working at the speed. Yeah, it\nwas it was really tough. From all of us\nhere at SBT Gravel, presented by Wahoo,\nwe'd like to say a huge thank you to all\nof our participants, riders, racers,\nfamily members, friends, volunteers, and\nsponsors for making this entire weekend\npossible. We couldn't do it without you,\nand we look forward to seeing you again\nin June 2026."

      "transcript": "[Music]\ni honestly have no idea\nif i'm gonna finish\n[Applause]\nyep\nthat's me\ncompletely cooked 100 miles into the\nlongest ride i've ever undertaken\nwhat on earth was i thinking\nmy brother just said why the are\nyou doing this i'm praying for you\nroughly three months and two days ago i\nthrew my name into the hat to try and\nride the steamboat gravel race in the\nheart of the rockies\nand it wasn't just any of the four loops\nthat you could choose from but the\nlongest one\n224 kilometer gravel loop up until now\nmy longest ride is 180 kilometers a\nmassive 44 kilometers shorter but lucky\nenough i've had some help with my\ntraining along the way plus when we\nmentioned this to our mates at ribble\nthey were super keen to get involved too\nso with training in hand and a bike in\nanother i have very little reason to\nback out now\nhalf an hour before the start of the\nrace bike is all prepped\ni'm more prepped got so much food in my\nback pockets because all i have to do\nnow is eat the food\nand ride my bike i physically can't fit\nany more food in my back pocket so\nyeah so\nfind a little preparations now\nto get ready and then head to the start\nline\nyikes\nstarting to feel real now\nit's all gotten\nquite a while to the start but i'd line\nup early\nit\nis pandemonium after the neutral section\nends\nto start i got quite a good position on\nthe grid i got there i'd say it was\nmaybe like 150 people back from the\nstart which was quite good and then we\nhad the first bit which was neutralized\nwhich it was okay there's just a lot of\npeople everywhere and\nwhen i get in that situation i get very\ncompetitive i'm like i need to get to\nthe front i don't know why i needed to\nget to the front of the neutral section\nbut i felt the need so i kind of got\nquite close to the front um and then as\nsoon as we hit the gravel that was like\nyeah it all just started to straight out\nso i knew it was going to be dusty\nstrong gravel but literally after that\nfirst gravel section i was covered in\ndust my bike was filthy\nkeeping my heart rate a little bit\nhigher than it should so\ni found myself quite a nice\nbig group to sit in now so\njust trying to we all suck as best as i\ncan but\nless than 200k to go that's good\nso\nthe kilometers are slowly ticking down\n45 kilometers in\ni've just stopped at a uh\nfeed zone\nthought i better get some water\njust in case\nbut yeah everybody kind of split up the\nfeed so kind of on my own a little bit\nnow\nbut yeah\n45k down\ncan't do the math to however many\nare to go but\ni'm just going to keep pedaling\nand the kilometers are gonna take down\nslowly\njust had some single track\nthat was very bumpy and fun\nalmost like a cycle cross race\nbut\nback on the smooth tarmac now but\ni can't believe\nhow like\ndisgusting it is already so much like\ndust i mean look at stay at the bike\nalready\n100 miles to go\nwow\nyou do need to keep on\nchecking in with yourself like\nsometimes you can forget\nhow far you have to go\nso yeah\ni mean\ntwo two hours 38\nminutes in already\num\njust need to keep on riding at my own\npace\nit's quite hard to\nbe with a group\nand they're pushing a little bit out of\nyour comfort zone you're like oh if i\ncould just stay with them\na little bit longer it'll be good\nbut you're better off\njust kind of riding your own pace\nslow and steady definitely wins the race\nin this case\nnow you're probably wondering\nwhat is this bike i'm riding well you\ncan't actually see because of all the\ndust so\nand plus i haven't got the energy to\ntell you right now so here's something i\nprepared a little bit earlier\nyep i knew i would be a little bit too\ntired to tell you about my bike but this\nis ribble's pure gravel machine the\nribble gravel sl\nit's fast it's responsive it's light\nit's pretty much everything i need for\nthis event it's got a carbon frame\nanother really cool thing about ribble\nis that all the components are\ncompletely changeable so if you want a\ndifferent size stem or different size\nhandlebars you can do that whereas a lot\nof other bike brands you kind of get\nwhat you're given so that's another\nreally cool thing i've also got 650b\nwheels on here with 47 mil fast tires\nthe bike you can get it was 700c wheels\nbut i've opted for 650. the size of the\nframe is extra small\nwhat else have i got nice flared\nhandlebars for a bit extra comfort so\nthey're going to be really good for this\nlong ride i've got shram rival group set\none by with a nice big granny ring on\nthe back which i'm going to be very\nthankful for and i'm definitely going to\nneed going up those hills this bike also\nhas a load of mountain points to put\nbags on if you're going adventure riding\nyou want to strap your tent on your\nsleeping bag which hopefully i'm not\ngoing to need hopefully it's not going\nto be an overnight job but i'm actually\ngoing to count how many months there are\nso one two\ntwenty twenty one mounting points\nyou can fit your whole kitchen sink on\nthis bike if you wanted to\nand the last little cool detail i've got\nmy tire setup tubeless and you might\nhave seen these nice little cool flashy\npink muck-off valves do you like that\nvery nice but now\nback to future man on suffering in the\nrace god help you man\nflying on halfway\nand\ni feel like this is really where\nwhere it starts\nthat last 100k was in my comfort zone\nfrom here on in\nnot in my comfort zone and i can feel it\nin a grasshopper i haven't eaten one i\nreally don't want to they're so big\nhey evil they're like little birds\nthey're absolutely everywhere and when\nyou're suffering and you've got your\nmouth open\noh this is a good combination\nyeah i'd wear my ear hole then\nright save your energy\nno screaming\nblack horse black horse right there\nblack horse\nthat's so good\nyes please\nthank you\noh that's good\nright\ni'm ready to go\nso i've just come out the feed zone and\nthe plan was to know to take a minute\ngo to the toilet i have some snacks sort\nmy back pockets out\nwhat did i do i just grabbed some water\nand ran i don't know why but i just\npanicked i was like oh my god i need to\ngo\non the next one make sure i stop\noh\nthis turned out to be a bigger mistake\nthan i first thought\nthis is a really hard bit of gravel road\nand i feel like i've almost hit a wall\nand still a long way to go\na little bit worried\nthere was a point and i was like i'm not\ngonna make it to the finish\num i was really struggling every single\npedal stroke here i didn't want to pedal\nand it was all like a really gradual\nuphill there was a one bit of road that\njust killed me off and i don't know what\nit is it wasn't anything steep it was\njust a really draggy\ngravel road and i found it really hard\nmy head was falling off my legs were\nfalling off i couldn't sit down i just\nneeded to get off the bike\nit's really sad to kick in now\nand it's getting to a point where\ni just don't want to eat i just\ni feel sick\nand it's like shoving food down you\nit's not pleasant but\nif it gets me to the finish line\nthat's what i have to do\nbut i'm full on\nin survival mode now\njust\npedaling\ni can hardly keep my hand up to hold\nthis camera it feels like it weighs a\nton i'm gonna have to turn it off i\ncould not wait to get to that feed zone\nand every other feed zone before that i\nkind of stopped for like a few minutes\ngot some water and got straight back but\nthis one i was like i need to get off my\nbike i need to have a sit down i need to\nreevaluate the situation\nand then go from there\noh my god\nwhose idea was this\ni\nactually quite like pickles\nso i'm hoping this is going to give me\ni don't actually know what's meant to do\neverybody raves on about pickles and\npickle juice and gravel so here we go\nhi carumba\nbefore that\nfeed stop\nit was very touch and go\nyou know when\nyou're just pedaling so you want to do a\nstop and\nevery single pedal stroke hurts\nand every bump in the road\nreally makes me angry\ni do feel a lot better now i definitely\nneeded that but i\nwant to last 40 miles\noh god i hope i can make it\nthe weather\nhas just all of a sudden turned it's got\nvery gray very cloudy\nwhich is actually quite nice because\nit was so hot before\ni wouldn't mind a little bit of a\nshower\nthey'd be very welcome right now\nhuh\n[Laughter]\ni finally got my pickles\nis it really weird that i really like\nthem\nfinishing stretch now so i've got a\npickle in my mouth but\ni'm gonna get going so don't stop too\nlong on my legs\ni'm gonna crush it up\npull that pickle\ni've now officially\nmade it past\nthe longest i've ever ridden\n193 kilometers\nin the bag\nnot too long to go now\nbut um\nthis might be a little bit too much\ninformation but my bottom is very sore\nwhoa multitasking and this\ngravel thing\nis not for the faint-hearted\nyou have to be hard\nstrong\nyou can tell i'm now because i'm\ntalking absolutely\nofficially\ninto the last 20 kilometers\nthis search and go\none minute i feel\nokay the next i'm like wow\nmy head's like i'm gonna get off this\nbike right now\nand every single little incline\nso painful\nit was probably like the last like 6k\nof the race i realized that i've\nactually i am going to finish this and i\nam going to actually do it i don't think\nit like kicked in till then and i think\nby coming into this race i had a lot of\nworry and doubt just because it's the\nunknown i've never done anything like\nthis before this distance\nespecially on gravel um so it was it's\nquite emotional finish i was quite proud\nof myself um and yeah it's definitely an\nachievement it just goes to show that\nour bodies are a lot more capable than\nwe think and we shouldn't doubt\nourselves i prepare for something new\nwhatever it was that held me back i'm\nsure it wasn't true\nagain\nhello\num the event for me in a sentence\nit was an emotional roller coaster but a\nvery enjoyable one and now that i finish\nand i've had a little bit of time to\nrecover\nit's been some very good memories and\ni'd like to do it again"

      "description": "Traveled to Steamboat Springs from Jax Bch for my first SBTGRVL BLCK, left Jax on Friday AM and came back Monday AM allowing my body \u20180\u2019 acclimatization.\n\nOrganization, people, activities, town, farmer\u2019s market, race fair/shindig, HLLCLMB, yoga class, volunteers, local restaurants, locals, etc, etc were superb.\nMy black course race not so much. In fact, the black course did me.\nRode my TopStone Cannondale, knobby 40mm w/ tubes, ate/drank INFINIT nutrition stuff (use code: gavelmauve) and LMNT to get salty and less crampy.\nI regret not going to one of the multiple, willing, mechanics that would have taken 15 minutes to tune up my bike after flying in a hard case. They were available all day Friday and Saturday and I did not take advantage of it. Furthermore, during the race each Aid Station and a few other random places sprinkled in between all had mechanics that I, again, passed on. Not sure why, but in an effort to finish faster, I delayed my arrival.\nI had a few mechanicals during the race: flat, not proper shifting, brakes rubbing (realized after finish), but had a great experience in rural CO.\nFirst 20 miles to the 1st Aid were smooth. They felt a little tough, maybe the altitude or maybe the brakes but was able to make good time. After the station in the Wahooligan pass I had my first flat, lost my riding partners and the wheels came off shortly after.\nGetting to the 37 and 67miles station was tough, but was able to join a small group of about 3-4 and we kept each other company to the halfway station in Hayden.\nThe toughest 25 miles were after the Hayden Station, the wind was strong from the SE and for the next 25 miles we headed mostly SE and uphill too. During mile 80ish I had to stop, get in the fetal position, puke, question my life choices again, and somehow talk myself out of quitting. (this is the part when I think about explaining to my kids, wife, fam in general and social media).\nAfter the puke and the last bit of uphill, again some race volunteer in a van was just there. Just there waiting for me!!! I really hope he understands that his words and proper description of the miles ahead gave me the hope and encouragement I needed. Sat in his van ate something drank a nasty warm coke and continued.\nThe mental F**k of this race is that once you enter the \u2018champagne\u2019 you do not leave it basically for 110 miles. It all looks beautiful, but it looks the same for a long time. (Does have a \u2018Southern Spain\u2019 feel to it. Just south of their Sierra Nevada.)\nThe last 20/30 miles of the course are \u2018earned\u2019, you could say they make you suffer at the front end so that you enjoy some downhills and (defntly planned :wink: ) tail winds. The last two aid stations were nice. One had a teepee to chill for a minute and get shade, both were fully staffed and stocked, I needed mostly ice and got it.\nThe ride into town was fast, the tarmac and the tail winds helped.\nAfter my arrival, shower and the award ceremony I volunteered folding the barricade signs and breaking up a bit. Went to the room, packed the bike, slept 3 hours and headed to the airport.\n\nWill prob do again, very differently, next year.",
