Just enjoy some of the events, activities and races you know you've loved in the past... so it was a 'no brainer' to sign back up for one of Europe's premier amateur events, Gran Fondo Strade Bianche.

The not too short and not too long, the Goldilocks Granfondo for sure!   \n\nThis video is different to my previous Strade Bianche Video, which had many camera angles and demonstrated the beauty of the event.  This one focuses on the rider perspective with full power overlay, so you can see where I pushed hard and where I conserved a little energy for a decent time.\n\nAs always Andiamo Cycling arranged a perfect 4 days, and I would also highlight that this is not a paid promotion, I pay full price and highly recommend them for this event and many others.

mammal SES plus a\nfew youngsters with potential and big\nBig Dreams Ruth and Matthew are with me\nI'm we going to H it fast and hot into\nthe grand Fondo Str of\nYankee this morning's coffee is courtesy\nof s y s double espresso\ncheers isn't too bad right all\n[Music]\nright whilst he was prime minister of\nItaly Sylvia biscone the self-imposed\nJesus Christ of politics but also an\navid swifter my very reliable sources\ninformed me decreed that the start of\nall real life Grand fondos in Italia\nshould replicate his favorite cycling\ngame so by legal decree involving no\nbribe of any Senator let the chaos rip\npotato\n[Applause]\nchip I don't know about you but I prefer\nER to start all of my events on a\ndescent with 6,000 other Riders many of\nthem held bent on smashing today Pat's\ntime do not fear no cyclist was hurt in\nthe making of this video skills on\nskills I would have face planted and\nspeed dialed a&amp; e time to hit the after\nburner and get to the sanctuary of an\nupward gradient I'd enter the event for\nthe always Immaculate Andy AMU cycling\nwho organized an Incredible 4 days and\nfurnished us with their excellent\nPinella grevel with its one by group set\nand thick thick tires for improved\nhandling and lower puncture risk and for\nsure reliability trumps weight savings\nfor me in this event I am after all a\nmammal\nin the edit I've tried to impart the\nbeauty the Relentless lumpy terrain some\nof it proper steep plus the madness and\nthe speed mammal speed that is which is\na slightly more pedestrian version of\nVander pole peacock or Pacha you'll\nunderstand up the\nWs that was a mad old wild 20 minutes\nwasn't it\nhow Wild that was it\nwas it's quite scary at times\nactually H in a\ndog only the Italians would commence a\nrace on a descent that was just that was\nworse than a time before wild and with\nthat Matthew took his hand glider back\ninto the dog fight and as an aside I\nfirst met Ruth and Matthew during the h\nrot dollon and loved their conversation\nand ability to bring lul Vita to any\ngiven situation especially concerning\ncycling understated class and it made my\nweekend when they signed up with Andy\narmo to take on the Strada take care\nhere Chia CH I'm going to let some of\nthe scenes flow raw and leave it to the\nvisuals and the power overlay to impart\nthe thrill of this Fondo\nstraeto the first of very very\nmany well Matthew you destroy me on a\nflatten The Descent but I think I the up\nhand on the\nincline well One S Miss one car time for\ntalking oh dear\nme it's a\nhard they didn't it up do\nthey\ncow second gravel sector\nI was a tad premature to call sector 2\nbecause first we had to negotiate a\nstraeto for me this sector is superb\nFast and Furious one of the best Sublime\nbut fear not because if you like your\nrides that little bit shorter it also\nfeatures on the media fing\nCy Cy\nthir Big Time\nincoming as you're going to see by\ndecree of avid swifter and our old\nfriend Sylvio B the first climb in any\nItalian Grand Fondo is flavored chaos\nwith a generous sprinkling of Carnage as\nwe also saw in the Epic Grand Fondo TR\nValley veret scene link to that is at\nthe end of this video\nhey up\nMatthew I'll see you shortly the\ngentleman was not for slowing because I\nhad my climbing hammer down and I was\npretty certain that once again Matthew\nwould overhaul me on the flats and the\ndeclines I reckon that on this rougher\nterrain the Pinella grel started to pay\ndividends\ndoes life get any better than threading\nthe eye of a needle through hundreds of\nriders up a gravel climb in Tuscany\nI was enjoying myself here so I'm\nletting it run long\nform as it's teeing up now it was\nappropriate to end this climb with a\nfinal flourish of chaos with the\nItalians managing to organize a traffic\njam on a closed Road\nperfection\nclocking in at just under 9 minutes for\nthe climb I didn't really travel the K\ntimes of those with Talent orbe I'm\npretty sure that after the Strada bian\nthey didn't really concern themselves\nwith a perusal of the straa\nleaderboards as for the grand Fondo TR\nValley ver Racine there was no need to\nstop at the feed stations for an event\nof this length with this elevation at\nthis temperature the night before for\ndinner I'd eaten loads of rice and peas\nplus olive oil and in the morning for\nbreakfast i' had plenty of carbs and\nsugar plus and fruit juice on the bike\nin both of the bottles each had 80 g of\nsis beta fuel plus I had two sis\ncaffeine gels each with 150 m G of\ncaffeine one of those as you saw was\nconsumed at the start plus three beta\nfuel gels each of 40 G of carbs in those\nplus two bars each of those had 40 G\nthat would\nsuffice straeto supro\noh my\ngod get on\nfor save some wait for the first part of\nthe event I deposited my second bottle\nwith andyo cycling to collect here at\nthis predesignated point just ahead of\nthe split between the medor Fondo and\nthe gr Fondo which I was\ncompleting I think you know what this is\nin Italia\ngraty gry\nCH the glittering reward for this long\nstraight steep climb is once again fast\nfurious and\nSublime but first it's once again time\nto thread the eye of the needle\nand now time to let the terrain do the\ntalking laying on luxurious acceleration\nand exhilaration\nthis is another of the premier sections\nbut as always what the bian giveth it\ntaketh and is a tab to pay flavored\nsteep but for every Ascent there is of\ncourse an equal and opposite and more\noften than not luxurious\ndescent a Sublime Relentless rapid\nglorious SLO Fest of a bicycle ride the\nstrata bian Fondo is mesmerizing\nand after very different yet somehow\nfamiliar terrain and Rhythm we jump\nforward in\nkm's and the beat goes on high heart\nrate deep breathing poing up the fine\nleaves from all around and winding up\nthe torque whilst trying to reel in a\nfew more\nRiders I set my science in getting past\nthis matching pair\nclose but no\ncigar since Slam in 21 I have learned\nthe value of stealing Watts or maybe\nborrowing Watts from others but\nsometimes there's a little investment in\npower that simply needs to be made in\norder to get to the sanctuary of a\npelaton\nyeah I mean I did feel a little bit\nguilty when he looked around to find a\nmamal on a grel manacle to his rear tire\nyou B at a shot of an Italian riding no\nhanded in the pelaton and usually not\ntexting\nand courtesy of the diesel engine in\ngreen this was my gretto to take me back\nto Sienna or be with a little CYO\ntourism at full gas on the nearly white\nroads\nproper Beast of a gravel section here\nbut there is actually worse to\ncome compare and contrast my labored\nEndeavors with the pro PR who Glide up\nthis good prep for the Fred Wht\nthough this lady in red black and white\nfrom M gretto proved to be a very\nformidable Rider try as I might I didn't\nmanage to drop\nher I can

disappointment for me I\nthought I'd actually managed to dispatch\nMr sedal quickstep from the gretto\nclearly not\nthe run into Sienna it isn't trivial\nthis is the penultimate gravel\nsection like the coppen BG it's very\nmuch easier actually than the coppen BG\nbut what I was actually meaning is it's\nnarrow there's loads of riders and it's\na bit like the copen BG during the tour\nof fler scort where if a rider in front\nputs their foot down you got literally\nnowhere to go you're going to have to\nstop you can see that there really is a\nvery nice Rhythm to the Grand fond\nStrada biane and I'm pretty sure it must\nbe the same for the race itself orbe it\nwith much better bike handling more\npower and a lot more speed\nand the march of the mammals and mammal\nSES goes on with me now getting back on\nterms with Mrs white black and red but\nalso Mis quick steps it\nup\nright proper ging gang gly this\nI think I may have seen the pros take\nthis corner with a little bit more\npanach gateway to our final gravel\nsection and it's a\ndoozy time to deploy ramming speed and\nstorm this Sandy no like it's the r\nradio tower climb in his zift race\nSylvia biscone Ardent
