      "transcript": "All right. All right. 10 9 8\n7 6 No, I'm just kidding. It's a\nvideo. Got you, nerds.\nWell, you can't really do worse than\nwhere we are now.\nThe Sunday Creek Classic by Wild and Co.\nis 120 km of mostly dirt road riding\nwith about 3100 m of elevation.\nIf you're from Brisbane, it's pretty\nclose to riding the full Mount Cther\nroad loop 12 and a half times. The race\nstarts at the Kennallorth Showgrounds,\nheads up the road past the bakery, turns\neast into the hills. Depending on the\nperson and the weather on the day, it\nwill take between 4 and 10 hours.\nMy team being Nick, Mel, Davis, uh, and\nmyself, we set off from Brisbane at\nabout 4:30 a.m. The drive up was pretty\ngood. Full of coffee, snacks, nervous\nchitchat,\ngrass ass.\nWe got to the showgrounds in plenty of\ntime. Got a park right away thanks to\nthe helpful parking guy. Once we got our\nrace numbers and our toilet visits out\nof the way, the race kicked off right on\ntime at 7:00\n[Music]\na.m. Mel had earlier suggested that\nwe'll experience a rolling series of\nemotions through the day and that turned\nout to be very true for all of\nus. I'd say there are three notable\nclimbs in this race. The first being\nonly 6ks into the course in the pine\nforest. This climb isn't actually much\nin the scheme of things. It's only a few\nminutes long, but it's the first one of\nthe day and it likely had most people in\ntheir easy\ngear. Then the ride up to Mount Buggery,\nwhich involves onoff walking for about\n45 minutes. The final major climb being\nthe first half of the actual Sunday\nCreek Road\nitself. Goes for about an hour and it is\nup up up up up up\nup. But the real climb of this 120 km\nrace is a secret climb and it goes for\nthe first 92 km of the race. All of\nthem. All 92 km. The course has ups and\ndowns for those first 92ks, but it's\nalways trending slightly up. The\nshowgrounds, where you start, is about\n100 meters above sea level, and that\nmagical 92 km mark into the race is\nabout 840 m above sea level. It is death\nby a,000 tiny\nclimbs. The saving grace is it is\nabsolutely gorgeous the entire time. It\nsends you through so many different\nareas. starts in that pine forest, then\nit's just valleys, creeks, there's green\nareas, there's brown areas, speedy\ndowns, walky ups. Not to mention the day\nthat we were there for the 2025 edition,\nwe were gifted the perfect weather for\nthe entire day. And for the days leading\nup to the race, leaving the course in\nprime riding condition.\nThe four of us had decided ahead of the\nrace that we'd ride our own races and\nnot try to stick together unless it just\nsort of fell out that\nway. We all finished between 6 hours 45\nand 8 hours 15\nminutes. And just getting across that\nfinish line was a solid accomplishment.\nIf we'd been offered an early exit at\ncertain points of the race, I'm sure we\nall would have been quite\ntempted. If you are considering the\nrace, bring a few $1 coins for the\nshower after. I was fortunately donated\na dollar by a lady that had finished\nwell ahead of me.\nAs the website suggests, the race is\nreally tough. And it's not the distance\nor the total meters or the notable\nclimbs. It's the intensity. You are\ntrying to ride as fast as you can the\nentire\ntime, which is only possible, at least\nin my case, by force-feeding lolly\nsnakes and power aids long after I was\nsick of eating all the\nsugar. every 12 minutes when my eat a\nsnake alarm went off on my watch. It was\nbittersweet. I knew that reminder was\ngoing to get me through. But those\nsnakes became pretty tough to chew when\nI got into the 30s and\n40s. Our whole team was well prepared\nand or really we were probably just\nquite lucky that we didn't have any bike\nissues. We didn't have any flat\ntires. We had a mish mash of mountain\nbikes and Mel had her gravel bike. All\nour bikes are very entry level, but they\ngot the job done. No complaints.\nSince the race, we've all identified\nlittle improvements we could make for\nnext year, but we don't see any major\nimprovement in our time as we're not\nreally dedicated riders. We just like to\nride in spare time and on the weekends.\nThank you. Thank you. Thank you.\nBy the time we'd all wrapped up, the\nbakery was closed for the day. But\nfortunately, there was a pizza place\nopen and their pizzas were top shelf."

      "transcript": "Sunday creek classic 2023\nfor about 20 K's in\nwe've already done\n400 meters of climbing of the three and\na half thousand\ng'day crew welcome back to the channel\nas today we take on a little gravel race\nknown as the Sunday creek classic 120\nkilometer gravel race based out of a\nlittle town at Kenilworth which is in\nthe hinterland of the Sunshine Coast\norganized by wild and Co who are famous\nfor the likes of geoquest the legend\nAdventure Race Hells Bells Terra Nova\nyou should automatically know that this\nis not going to be a walk in the park\nand I can tell you it definitely wasn't\nso Kenilworth is about 40 minutes from\nthe coast or about an hour 45 North of\nBrisbane is generally famous for its\ncheese it's dairy products and it's\nBakery and if you manage to finish the\nSunday creek classic first place I'd go\nstraight to the bakery and have a crack\nat those one kilo Donuts\nso the course is over 90 gravel mostly\non Trails fire roads and just gravel\nroads over 3 000 meters of climbing\nthere is definitely one section you'll\nbe hiker biking no matter how good you\nthink you are in another section called\nMount buggery where only eight Riders\nwere able to get up there I'm good\nwelcome thank you\nacross the course you'll find two\ncheckpoints one at the top of Mount\nbuggery about 45 K's in and the other at\na little town called gymna which is\nabout 80 K's in you'll find water snacks\nand a little bit of nutrition but that's\nabout it\nthis year the roads were in pretty bad\nshape this is the second time they've\nrun this race got canceled twice last\nyear due to bad weather and I rode my\ngravel bike this year previously I rode\nmy mountain bike and on reflection I\nshould head it the other way around\nSunday Creek Classic\nupdate number two\nwe have\n55ks done\nfirst hike of bike section\nup Mount buggery\nthat's such balls who's ticking along\naveraging about 20 calories an hour\nexploding the walks\npretty gnoliated today but\none another than last time\n[Music]\nyeah\nlaughs\nthank you\nwe camped in Kenilworth at show grounds\nwhere the start of the races cost us 20\nbucks hot showers down the road from the\npub perfect place to set up if you're\ngoing to be taking on the race super\neasy super convenient and we weren't\nalone there's plenty of other\ncompetitors who did the same thing\nthis race is not built to be easy Chris\nthe race organizer says on his website\nit's deliberately really really hard\nyou're gonna get wet feet you're going\nto have to hike a bike and you've got to\nbe really really self-sufficient super\nsuper important it's not a manufactured\ngravel race where there's 16 Aid\nstations and it's perfect Primo gravel\nthe whole way it is tough but it is\nbeautiful out there too so don't let\nthat scare you too much\nso what did I run I took my Savella was\nBarrow standard grx I think I've\nreplaced a seat post with a carbon seat\npost apart from that all pretty stock\ntwo water bottle holders with hunt 35 x\nwide wheels and terravale washburns\nwhich I ran as 38 mil probably not wide\nenough for the conditions I did have to\nrun 38 in the front and 45 in the rear\nhands today it's all arms did sore just\nfrom the vibration because I wasn't\nexpecting the road\nreally we should have taken my mount\nbike it just would have been a lot more\nenjoyable particularly the last sort of\n30ks it was super brutal whilst we're\ntalking about gear the one big thing is\nTire management the amount of flat tires\nand Mechanicals I saw right there was\nunbelievable\ntwo bottles of my infinite 90 gram\ncustom blend each of those bottles had\nthree hours in it so my goal was to\ndrink about two hours out of the first\nbottle and then tip that into my second\nbottle so I had four hours in there when\nI got to the first checkpoint so I then\nfilled that bottle up with water and\njust dropped a noon tablet in it on my\nback my salmon hydration pack in there I\njust ran two liters of water with two\nnoon tablets when I got to First\ncheckpoint topped that up checked\nanother noon tablet in and off I went\nnow for me the beauty of that was means\nI didn't have to stop at the second aid\nstation I also had two nodos tablets one\nat the four hour mark and one at about\nthe five and a half hour mark just to\nget me through the back end of the race\na little bit of caffeine a little bit of\nmental Clarity really really helped and\nI'm glad I took them Sunday creek\nclassic update\n84 K's deep\nthrough gymna\n2035 678 to go\noh hold on\nwe're in\nthe longest climb of the day not the\nsteepest but the longest\nliving K's\nhad a nail limit back there\nit was about a k at 17\nnot cool\nmaybe 500 meters\nslide exaggeration\nfeeling a bit better now than what I was\nearlier\nwhich is good\nwe're into the Sunday Creek rainforest\nif I remember\nI'll show you where I went to grade\nseven Camp whoa\nproper type to fun we're just spending\ntimes in the Box hurting and suffering\nbut as soon as you're finished you're\nlike I can't wait to come back next year\nit was awesome probably the key\ntakeaways make sure you're prepared read\nthe instructions download the map sort\nyour hydration out make sure your bike\nis in Tip-Top shape\nhow did my rice go I think it took me\naround 6 hours 48 minutes I finished\n19th overall average heart rate of 154.\ngot to the two hiker bike sections\ndefinitely hiker bike this time previous\nyear I did try and ride up Mount buggery\nthink the gradient's around 27 really\nbad idea cook the legs for the rest of\nthe race the second section of hiker\nbike which is just unrideable wasn't as\nbad this year which is really really\ncool but it's still tough I don't know\nhow steep it was but someone threw out\nyou know 30 gradient with just big\nditches and wash out some things in it\nthere's a little downhill section at the\nend which gets really really steep a\nwhole bunch of us crashed or like me I\nended up in the bushes off the side of\nthe track where I couldn't navigate the\ncorner for me I was really really happy\nwith the race I felt really busted right\nnear the end I literally could almost\nfeel a cramp coming on with about three\nkilometers to go so for me that means\nperfect pacing if I stay with the front\ngroup for two kilometers then we hit the\nfirst climb and they were just down the\nroad and gone like the boys and girls\nthere just took off up this plant and it\nwasn't long and it wasn't steep but not\nenough climbing in my legs and just a\nsheer lack of talent in that space\nprobably doesn't help so they would go\non but most the day sort of with a\nlittle group all by myself for the first\nhalf and then by myself mostly for the\nsecond half those people that I did\ncatch were mostly Mechanicals and one\nguy who just stopped in front of me and\nsaid I'm done at the top of one of the\nHills\nit does get pretty gnarly at the back\nhalf\nwe will definitely be back next year\nlove the race super tough super fun you\ngo to the pub and have a beer afterwards\njust loved it big thanks to Wild and Co\nfor organizing it and hopefully we see\nsome of you guys out there with us if\nyou've made this far thank you very much\nyou're awesome please hit that subscribe\nsmash the like button and we'll join you\nnext time\nyeah roasty\nthrough the flags\n[Laughter]\nman"
