      "transcript": "all right for the second year in a row I\nchose to do swap Fox gravel Fondo down\nnear Charleston in South Carolina\nthis is definitely one of my favorite\nraces or favorite events\num so I definitely highly recommend it\nit's on flat roads through the Francis\nMarion state or national forest sorry\nthe Francis Marion National Forest and\num as you can see in just a moment\nthey have different lengths everything\nfrom\n27 miles\nthrough to 53 to 100 and the Moultrie\nmilitia I believe is 177 overnight mile\nride so this is just a root mat of the\n53 route that I did definitely no\nclimbing I think 197 feet of total\nelevation gain over 53 miles vast\nmajority of the ride is on dirt roads\nthroughout again just the Francis Marion\nNational Forest\ngorgeous day out here for the Swamp Fox\nuh ShakeOut ride look at people behind\nme awesome gorgeous day nice flat roads\nhighly recommend this right highly\nhighly recommend pineapple\nthis is\neverybody has their phones out\nso the weather was gorgeous for the\nShakeOut rides but it was absolutely\npouring for the start of the 100 miles\nthankfully it did let up for the start\nof the 53 Miler and you can stay\nthroughout the rest of the day\nall right here we are at the start\nthanks for the rains lit up for now\num got a nice little crowd out here\nwhere the over 50 or over 40 crowd so\nlooking forward to the next few hours\nthe Swamp Fox\nI will thank you\nthank you\nthank you for coming\nthank you we got one down\nso the start and finish of the race\nwe're in this grassy field it's not\nwe're on the Nebraska field for just a\nfew moment\nweed pit pavement and we wrote pavement\nfor about the first two miles which is a\nnice way to kind of get our legs\nloosened up and as usual I start coming\ntowards the back of the pack so so I am\nnot at all sure where these people came\nfrom that are passing me\num but that's quite all right they can\nride their race I will ride mine and we\nwill see where everybody finishes up at\nthe end\n[Applause]\nso after our first three miles we\nfinally hit the first dirt road and as\nyou can see there is not another Rider\nin sight so I get these nice dirt roads\nall to myself\nforeign\nhere we are a few more miles down the\nroad and I'm starting to catch up to\npeople this is when I start to realize\nthat my slow and steady at the start\nreally does work for me as other people\nkind of fly off and do their thing\nI stay nice and slow and do my thing but\nthen eventually do catch up with folks\num\nI have to admit I do enjoy catching up I\nenjoy being around other Riders and not\ndoing all of the writing online\nall right we're out here\nI'll almost 17.\nWayne has\nbeen the most part led up\nbut oh yeah the damage hasn't done to be\ngross\nyeah\nmine start right now\nokay\nlet's keep tunneling\nwho's that at least amount of power\nneeded I really don't know what way\nahead uh\nI really don't want to burn all my\nmatches here\nbut a little power necessary needs a\nfair amount of power\nto stay upright and these\nwet\nkind of Sandy\nkind of dirty not addressed\nbut\nour hands\nI'm really enjoying the day\nI'm having a good time\nall right here we are\nat the middle swamp box\nuh\na little bit of a muddy day\ngot some rain\npuddles so yeah it's kind of a nice day\nthough really enjoying it\noh yeah gotta go\nsh can I come on your left please\nhey there\nuh my goodness am I tired I'm at Mile 48\nout of like 52. so yay almost done\nbut what a slog it has been my quads are\nkilling me they're screaming\nwe've been riding through mud all day\nlong\nand I'm just really Furious\nwhat's what would you be saying to\nyourself in these times what would be\nyour motivational self-talk\nmine right now just is all right you're\ngone 48 miles\nyou can do four more\njust one pedal stroke at a time\nuh but yeah I'd love to know what you\nwould say hi\nyeah you've got it though\nso just a little recap of Swamp Fox I\nwould definitely recommend this race\nthis was like I said my second year\ndoing it and I'm already considering\nsigning up for a third year number one I\nlove supporting these smaller races\nthese smaller races make it easy and\naccessible for many people to get into\ngravel racing and writing I like that\nthis one has a different mileage choices\nfrom the 27 to the 53 to the 100 to the\n177 so there's a little bit of something\nfor everybody\nI found the race organizers to be very\nfriendly and welcoming\nI like that this is kind of a beginner\nfriendly course it is flat the roads are\neasy to ride we are on dirt roads for\nmost of it but do have some pavement\nI like that it is relatively near\nyou know like a major city so you can\nget in and out if you need to\nflying in so definitely consider putting\nSwamp Fox on your race calendar next\nyear and hopefully I'll see you there"

that big of a\ntemperature degree but let me show you\nwhat's in mind we hope I don't need it\nbut just in case Pat neck warmer ear\nwarmers\nthe rain pants once again hope I really\ndon't need them

challenging\nof a trail right now and in fact if I\nrecall this road might actually be\ncalled\nuh hellhole Road hell hole road so uh\nwe'll see how it bodes for us\nwe are now looking for toads because\nthey are darting everywhere and they are\ntrying to like\nget us hurt or something\nbecause they keep just jumping out but\nevery time I try to take a video\noh there goes one\noh there it goes\nI don't think we can see that one\nquite cute\nthese guys are like trying to kill us\nlike every time we're like cruising\nAlong on this hellhole Road they just\njump\nright in front of us and then we have to\nlike hit the brakes real hard because we\ndon't want them to get hurt\npretty electrical substation here all\nlit up\neven though it's dark\ncan't really see it but we are now\nriding on a dice a Long Lake Moultrie\nwhere at the north northern end of Lake\nMoultrie\nver it is 5 a.m We Are 84 miles in that\nmeans we are\njust about halfway I guess we can call\nit halfway there\nuh all right onward we go hopefully we\nwill get to see the sunrise soon and\nthere's some goldens\nand\nI have no need to stop no neither do I\nall right there's a gas station normally\nwe'd stop at

very unique trees in\nthis Lake they have these really big\nroot balls I'm not quite sure how they\ngrow like that I don't know if it's just\nreally shallow there we'll have to look\nthat up when we get home\noh my\ngot some big muddy ruts here\noh crap\nokay that might have not look that good\non camera but that was pretty fun\nso as much as Jess and I enjoy riding at\nnight\nit is also quite\nenjoyable to actually see the forest\nat night we do get to see fun\nLittle Creatures scurrying across the\ntrail\nnow we actually get to see the trail\nI guess there must have been a\ncontrolled burn here\nor a forest fire who knows\nso here's a really good example of how\nthe road was used as the fire break\nobviously burnt on the left side of the\nroad\nand all green and bushy on the right\nside of the road so obviously this road\nwas used as a fire break\nfire was\nthere back there\nI wonder if we're gonna see any\nfirefighters out here today\non the right\noh look at that\nall right let's see\n175 miles or so in and look just can\nstill smile no matter what Jess will\nsmile\nworking on it it wasn't always a smile\non her face but she's smiling now we're\nalmost

      "transcript": "Evelyn and I are here to find out how's\nthe hike on the swamp fox passage of the\nPalmetto Trail\nwell we're underway uh no no where we're\ngoing is on that sign we're gonna pass\nthrough halfway Creek in six miles it's\na Friday and just after a new year\nbefore other girls go back to school\nOlivia's busy yep ease with me today and\nwe're gonna try to do 17 miles to Turkey\nCreek where there's an unmarked campsite\nand then tomorrow a big day probably the\n20-mile range to get to king gulley ya\nknow we're under way you're going and\nthen the next day a little shorter as we\nget to the other end 47 miles it's the\nlongest section of the Palmetto trail\nand it's basically in our backyard I\nhike out here all the time with my\nbackpack on just to stay in shape and so\na lot of this trails very familiar to me\nincluding where we are right now and\nthen mum will join us tomorrow where we\ncross highway 41 there's a place for her\nto park there she's gonna do two days\nand overnight with us so Olivia is still\nsleeping so all right first hike of 2019\nall right we're coming up to the\nintersection ooh slippery this is the if\nyou're going to the island dot passage\nif you're actually gonna do the hundreds\nof miles of the Palmetto Trail you would\nhave started down that trail and then\nyou're starting here basically at mile\nseven of that trail is where you\nintersect we've done that trail a lot I\nusually hike\nmost of the on a passage probably once a\nmonth once every six weeks really nice\nstretch down by the Intracoastal\nWaterway that's beautiful and easily\naccessible so but as you can see on this\ntrail very very flat that's why we're\ntrying to squeeze in high mileage days\nand do this three days instead of four\nbecause really most of the trails just\nflat like this so no ups and downs\nfirst of many road crossings left a\npause here\nsteed Creek Road\nalmost time for our first break\nlots of forestry roads out here have\ntheir access points this is the one\nsection of this area of trail I've never\nhiked few miles a couple miles that I\nhaven't hiked before so it's nice to see\nsomething new and we're finally getting\naway from traffic and the busy roads\nbeing a Friday morning rush hour when we\nstarted it was lots of just lots of\ntraffic so it's nice to get away from\nthat too so almost time for our first\nbreak had a nice little break back there\nand come out of the woods now we're on\nthis forestry road which as you can see\nis the trail for a little bit so you\nmake our way toward half-way Creek\ncampsite and halfway Creek Road and I'll\ntalk a little bit later about the water\nsituation on this trail but I'll just\nsay quickly that all of the water east\nof halfway Creek Road so the first part\nof the trail today is forest rangers say\nyou know probably not something you want\nto try to drink or filter a lot of\nbrackish salt inundation things like\nthat so yeah I'll touch on that in a\nlittle bit\none of the interesting things about this\ntrail is the sudden changes in the\nforest I mean so much of it is but tall\npine trees then you walk into something\nlike this and then eventually back out\nof it back into the pine trees just\nlittle cuts of different type of forest\nalways nice when the Forestry Service\nputs these out\nmysterious Bay's unsolved geological\nmysteries what's interesting though is\nwe just walked past if you can look just\nover my over the sign here you can see\nthe the marshy swampy Bay that we're in\nand I think a duck just scared the heck\nout of it no it was a couple ducks\nmade a big left turn\nfollowing halfway Creek we're gonna be\ncoming through the halfway Creek\ncampsite here in a couple minutes not\ngonna break there though cuz it's\nusually pretty busy with what the forest\nrangers call homesteaders folks and stay\nthere for quite a while so we'll go a\nlittle beyond that and then have a break\nand then we'll have another break when\nwe make the next right term because I'll\ntell you more about the water on this\ntrail at that time and we're stopping\nthere because I cashed some water there\nbut we're on that water situation up\nahead\nwell that's interesting we aren't even\nto the campsite yet somebody's going to\nthe trouble of building like walls maybe\nsome Boy Scouts or something no no yeah\nfirst I thought it might be for horses\nbut just look like some maybe some Boy\nScouts were out learning how to do some\nskills well here we are\nmile six halfway Creek that's a bunch of\nprimitive spots you can see where you\nsorry I've can see over here where you\ndrive in and park your car and come out\nand pitch your tent used to be a well\nhere back when the Forest Service had\nmoney that was a well and decommissioned\ntime she straight up ahead here above\nEvelyn's right shoulder so but six miles\nfrom the trailhead for us isn't enough\nwhen you're doing it through hike let's\njust right beside a very busy road so\nmore of a car camping type place than\nanything but you want to get away\ncertainly something to do but if I was\nhiking and I wanted to stop soon today\nI'd probably stop at Harleston dam which\nis a little further up in the woods and\na little more private but also busy\nespecially on the weekends lots of Boy\nScouts and folks\ncuz it's an easy easy to walk in so\nwe're camping up here and then let me\nget past this area and have our break if\nyou've ever wondered what a pinecone\ndoes when it falls to the ground there\nit is and then if you look over there\nyou can see how they get bigger and grow\nbut that's how they start out it's\npretty cool first time I ever saw that\nwas on this particular part of this\ntrail just doing some some day hiking so\npretty wet here right now in fact we've\njust been looking at the radar because\nwe still have a bit of cell service and\nwe know there's a cold front coming\nthank goodness because it's you know 100\npercent humidity out here right now but\nwe're gonna get rained on\nEvelyn keeps saying no it's not gonna\nhappen because neither her nor Olivia\nhave ever been rained on while while\nhiking like literally hiking but you\nknow at night sure but to do last year\n236 miles just at night well we'll see\nI turned the video on to show you these\ntrees so back when Hurricane Hugo came\nthrough it knocked this forest on its\nbum basically and I think they're called\nthe cockaded woodpecker became rather\nendangered so what the forestry folks\nhave done is when they see a a\nwoodpecker living in a tree they marked\nthe tree so that the tree is protected\nfrom any activity that might be going on\nso pretty neat you see that here a lot\nand for years I kind of wonder what saw\nwhat's that all about but that's what\nit's all about and of course being a\nNational Forest it's a mixed-use\ntype of thing including logging in\nplaces but that protects those trees for\nthose word peckers that took a long time\nto begin to recover after losing a huge\nportion of their habitat so we stopped\nhere for a break one day had the girls\nout doing a little training for the very\nfirst year they were doing some serious\nhiking I got a thing I got a video\nsomewhere just on my phone of the two of\nyou or Olivia especially just running\nthrough these were all growing up it was\nlike a wheat field yeah and you guys did\nthis running through there so\nI remember the science impossible to\nread it now something interesting is\nthere I don't know what but it's over\nthere I can see more or that kind of\nswampy area but well okay alright less\nthan a mile to go for sure to the water\ncash in the big turn up toward Turkey\nCreek closing in on eight miles at this\npoint and we are the shape we're just\ntalking about that you are totally at a\nshape\nand I'm worse out of shape so well this\nis a familiar parking lot to me the\ntrail goes over there crossed half way\nCreek Road and I use the park where this\ngentleman is or ladies whoever's park\nthere but behind that tree down there I\ncashed some water so I'm gonna go get it\nwe're gonna fill up our things and then\nI'm gonna explain to you why okay second\ntelling you we catch some water here and\nhere's why everything toward the ocean\nfrom halfway Creek basically not\nsupposed to filter it could be brackish\nsalty you know yucky everything this way\nup if you find fresh water you could\nprobably filter it in fact I added a a\ncarbon filter to our platypus gravity\nworks so that we could take the taste of\nthe swamp pose as best we could\nthat said I have cast water in different\nareas along the trail and I'll come and\npick up the bottles obviously after\nwe're done you know cuz you don't you\njust can't count on the water on this\ntrail the bottom line ah this time we\ncan because it's been raining non-stop\nthat's gonna rain again today so you get\nthe creeks will come up and you can\nfilter some water but a lot of times out\nhere it's bone-dry so and you know me I\nlike to be self-sufficient and carry\nwhat I need for the entire hike but the\nexception to that rule has to be water\nbecause what\nso get water cash here another one up\nthe way a little bit and then when we\nmeet Mom tomorrow morning at highway 41\nat the intersection there she'll have\nsome water in the car there that will go\nahead and fill up with as well so lunch\nbreak here and pretty much almost\nhalfway point to where we're heading\ntonight which is good last couple miles\nwould probably be in the rain well we'll\nsee now we've just crossed this a\nsection I know really really well this\nis kind of one of my go-to you saw they\ncome to hike it's prettier up in here a\nHarleston damn campsite is up here as\nwell I'll show you that when we get\nthere this is where I saw my first wild\npig in the woods I'll show you where\nthat was just for fun but nice little\nwalk up through here for a bit all right\nwe're kind of coming into the health and\nDam area the main campsite the official\ncampsites up aways but this is often\nused hasn't been used for a while\nthis often used here as a kind of a\nprimitive campsite we've come in to do\nsome training hikes and seen like you\nknow people who left the campfire kind\nof burnin so but you can see over there\nsome people have gathered wood and stuff\nso just off the road\nin fact we can still hear traffic so the\nbusy road anyway Carlson dams up here\nI'll show you that here next\nthat's promised over here I'll keep\nwalking because we're gonna keep moving\nthat's the Harrelson dam campsite nice\nfire pit in there often see Boy Scouts\ndown here and Families is because it's\nso close to the road how come out here\nwalk in and see people those signs back\nup that's good sit down for a while so\nyeah\nKarlsson damn we've been quiet because\nover here is where I first ran into the\nwild boar here in the Francis Marion\nNational Forest I stopped here one day\nand the trails not gonna turn left it\nused to go straight trails gonna turn\nleft now so I stopped here put my pack\ndown and went off into the woods for a\npee pee and then went up in there and I\nlooked over and I saw this black thing\nand I it scared me because you know\nexpect to see anything right I didn't\nscare me but it was like startled me so\nI went hey and a whole group of the\nMinor which call a group of pigs what\nare what are a group of pays we no no\nanyway I'll flush it right here uh they\nall took off into the woods and scared\nme as I go my goodness\nanyway no signs around here there lots\nof signs on the way up here but I\nhaven't seen anything around here right\nnow so this is interesting this has been\nclosed forever there was a big gully\nthere from I guess a washout or\nsomething and they've been in and fixed\nit so this road is now accessible\ninteresting Wow yeah it was a lot of\nmaintenance going on actually but what's\nfunny cuz I was out here doing a\npractice hiking there was a an old piece\nof equipment sitting up here it looked\nlike an antique to me but I guess it\nwasn't if they were using it cool\nwell if you can see that or not but some\nscat they're obviously whatever it is\neating these I've been saving these\nberries cuz that's the color of it now\nthere really aren't bears\nthere's not a large population of bears\nin this part of the state something\naround six sightings a year that said\nthere are six sightings a year so anyway\nwe're always careful for all types of\nanimals\nbut that's pretty fresh pretty fresh\ninteresting I don't know maybe we'll see\nsomething that would be cool our last\nrule crossing for the day last home\nstretch up to tricky Creek from here at\nleast that's our plan trail like this\nI'm always open to changing that but it\nis a nice little spot check for cars\nwhat you think I think we're safe so\nwe've got another water cache over here\nso what I'm gonna do is fill up our\ncamelbacks again our water bladders and\nthen put a little extra in the clean\nwater of the platypus\nso that we have water up here for\ncooking tonight I don't mind carrying a\nlittle extra weight so that I don't have\nto filter anything up there and then hey\nAnna we'll try to get a tarp setup that\nI brought them and then to abandon\ntomorrow in the car when the cross 41\nand pick up mama so a little break here\nin the rain and that's right first time\never hiking in the rain fun huh mmm\nalways a challenge\nfor me I'm pretty happy about these\nlittle boardwalks because I mean I've\nbeen out here when it's dry and there's\nstill water here not like this course\nbut a man alive someone lost their shoe\nwell there's a sight for sore eyes fire\npits in there\nlots of room I don't have up here the\nofficial entrance have you can go on in\nto me if he's backed up here so here it\nis tricky Creek and it's not on the\nofficial maps and that's fine it's nice\nto have something you know about and\nwell it was something that only a few\nnot a few people but there's a good\nwell-kept secret until the most recent\nedition of backpacker magazine came out\nbefore they talked about hiking this\ntrail and talked about this campsite so\nif you are watching this video because\nyou read that article hope you enjoy day\none it's like somebody's been out here\nsince I was here last and bucked up some\nwood we appreciate that I'm not sure\nit's gonna burn but we're gonna try it\nright mm-maybe can't speak we're gonna\nset up a tent I think right over there\nquickly set up a tent over here I'm\ngonna duck in there now it's getting\ndark so I want to show you this before\nit gets too dark\nyeah I'll set up the Garmin in reach\nover there trying to find a signal some\nmom knows were safe also so we can\ncontact her in the morning and say we're\nunder way because she's meeting us and\nuh you know if we can find some dry wood\nit'll be a bit of a chore we're gonna\ntry to have a fire first I'm gonna go\ninside and set up my stuff and uh\nlay down for a few minutes holy moly\nthat was a long day well that's the end\nof day one we left island uh early this\nmorning and hiked 18 miles up here the\ntricky Creek that's about 28 29\nkilometers almost 29 kilometres actually\nit's just a pretty long day for us yeah\nchallenged only by tomorrow which is\nsupposed to be 20 miles we don't have a\nlot of time to hike this trail right now\nso we're doing it in three days I would\nprobably suggest four but we'll talk\nabout that after we after we finally\nexperience the whole thing ourselves for\nmiles tomorrow morning early to get out\nbefore 9:00 to meet mom at highway 41\nand then 16 more miles to King gully\nwhich is supposed to be very pretty\ncampsite we'd love to stay there\ntomorrow night if we can make it but a\nlot of walking huh we've done some\npretty challenging days and some pretty\nchallenging elevations but after not\nhiking for a while the 80-mile said it\nwas felt pretty long yeah I mean 18\nmiles long in general you know it is\nit's a lot of stuff really is and it\njust no matter how fit you are it's\ngonna hurt your feet no matter what\nright and it was soaking wet and we had\nwaterproof socks on which I'll talk more\nabout tomorrow which saved this yeah\nyeah very very good so anyway we had a\nnice dinner and no campfire just too wet\nbut we'll try again tomorrow night for\nthat with mom and eat dinner in the\npitch-black we did eat dinner in the\npitch-black yeah but now we're just\ngonna take a little rest maybe play a\ngame and get a good night's sleep for a\nbig day tomorrow so see you in the\nmorning\nyou\nmorning welcome to day two about 7:20\nwe're off to meet mom just slowly pan\naround here everyone's packed up tents\npacked up we're good to go\nand thank you Turkey Creek a little bit\nof a interesting morning getting up in\nthe pitch-black but we did a good job\nand then of course just as the Sun\nstarts come up we heard gunfire which is\ninteresting because I actually hike this\ntrail that's kind of an internet day\nhike just to see this campsite so we\ncould bring everyone's friend out and I\nheard gunshots that day and that was\nlike on a Wednesday so I thought hunting\nseason was over but anyway it is in case\nyou're wondering that's why we have\nthese big yellow ring covers aren't even\non a day when it's supposed to be\nbeautiful and sunny because we want to\nbe seen just in case so we're kind of\nwarned that Turkey Creek might be\nflooding a bit and getting to the bridge\nmight require some water we have our\nwaterproof socks on again today I have\nto say they worked perfectly yesterday\nin the pouring rain and we had to walk\nthrough a lot of water an hour we were\ntoe sock liners they're perfectly Drive\ndry have it was fantastic so who\nactually bought these for the\nnorthbounder trail for last summer the\ninfamous now a northbounder trail\nbecause we thought we would just leave\nour boots on across some of the you know\nbad creeks so anyway they worked really\nwell highly recommended\nhere we are\nTurkey Creek Bridge hopefully not a\nswampy on the other side I think there's\nsome sections though that are swampy on\nthe other side but all right could be\nslippery have take your time we've just\ncome out of Turkey Creek area you can\nsee here that this is part of the\nexperimental forest stuff or was Forest\nResearch experimental plot please do not\ndisturb the area I'm assuming they mean\nup in there because the trail is right\nthere so we go on our way to highway 41\nwe'll be cross that and meet mom who\nwill do for the first time a 16 mile day\nbut it ain't sure she does yeah yeah all\nright well we're gonna find out nice to\nsee the Sun pretty grey a birds yeah\npretty grey yesterday and lots of rain\nlots of wet trail today especially in\nthe low sections which we're coming up\nto here again so it's hard to make time\npicking your way through there\nlots of signs of wild boar here too\nI've actually seen wild boar writing\naround this area when I was up here\nscouting no tricky Creek though maybe\nwe'll see one this morning all right\nwe're here at highway 41 and oh no if\nyou can see it there's mom in the car\nhighway 41 is very busy so we're gonna\nstop filming and cross safely and then\nmom's got a water cache for us and then\nwe're gonna head up hopefully another 16\nmiles that'll be up to mom see how that\ngoes\nwell we're off our water resupply the\nlonger break that we expect it but\nthat's okay\nthat's some redoubling of gear to do\nI dropped a tarp that we never used and\nsome poles and mom is here hi mom\nsixteen miles why do you feel\nyeah you shouldn't probably think about\nit that's a lot of walking and it's wet\nout here I will say this I'm excited now\nthat we're on this part of the trail\nbecause I had pretty much hiked that\nentire section you saw up until across\n41 in parts just for training you know\ngetting out the backpack on and getting\nin the woods so kind of knew all about a\nmile of that this I've never been on so\nI'm kind of excited we're gonna pass to\ncampsites today Nicholson Creek soon and\nthen whither be by the old ranger\nstation and if you had four days I think\ntonight you'd want to stay at whether it\nbe just hope the trains weren't too loud\nwith the rail line nearby instead of\ntrying to do a big day like this but we\nonly have three days to do this hike so\ntomorrow is hopefully a short day of ten\nmiles if we can get to king gully today\njust the goal but I would suggest four\ndays and you know usually for us we like\nto take our time and spread it out\nanyways this is quite the opposite so\nall we're - Nicholson Creek from here\nI don't have you can see this or not but\nwe're in the mountains we'd say we're\ngoing up a cut line we're not it's like\nan old cart path and look way up there\nthe light that's how far we've been\ngoing straight like this for the entire\ntime since we left the car when we met\nmom actually makes for really good\nwalking after what we did this morning\nthrough Turkey Creek welcome\nwe are past Nicholson Creek campsite\nI'll be honest with you I missed it we\nwere looking for it I want to show it to\nyou and I'm sorry\nI think what happens let's not\ncompletely we've all completely missed\nit on the trail you get to this\nintersection it's a like a cross and\nstraight ahead it looks like you're\ngonna go straight ahead on the trail but\nyou don't you make a sweeping turn left\nand I didn't really look right to see if\nthe campsite was too off to the right\nbut it's got to be there around that\nintersection because that's mile 28 so\nwe're gonna cross the road here and\nbasically follow whether it be so just\nkind of show you the trail comes out\nhere at the old it's you old would there\nbe ranger station they replace the\nstation with a nice new place down the\nroad trail comes out here there's a\nparking lot over there we're gonna\nactually take a break here in the shade\nand the trail heads back down that way\nright there we are almost to where I\nstashed more water and very close to the\nWetherby campsite which I hope I won't\nmiss so I can show you we've still got a\nways to go\nyep would there be primitive camp you\ncan read the old paint have a look\naround here I mentioned earlier pretty\nclose to the CSX rail tracks but a nice\nspot actually lots of ten pads\nwhat's the places to go a little fire\npit here\nso yeah just kind of scope a note water\nrunning over that hill over there nice\nlittle Creek perfect onward come back\nout towards the road we're gonna walk\ndown a little bit cross over the railway\ntracks I mentioned earlier then the\ntrail cuts back left on this side and\ngoes down to ward alligator Creek so\nwe're gonna do that well I said we've\nheard gunshots all day but didn't expect\nto see that see buckshot it's in pretty\ngood caliber shells there too this way\nlittle hellhole reserved\nkeep either less than three miles left\nto king gully we're gonna have to go in\nwhere they're building the bridge in the\ncampsite and then backtrack out in the\nmorning at least if I read the map\nthat's what I think I haven't seen it so\nwe'll know soon you can see the sun's\ngetting low about four o'clock it's been\na long day so not too far to go what's\nup bush walking for you\n[Music]\nwe are looking for mile marker 38 which\ngets us pretty much to king gully and\nthen we're gonna try to find the\ncampsite we know as I said before the\nbridge is out\ncampsites still permitted for use or any\nplace around there will be fine yeah at\nthis point pushing 20 miles for eV and\ni-16 for mom yeah well show you the\nkilometers right now on the screen okay\nbut here's dust now so our light is\nlimited the hunters are back out I guess\nbased on the time of day so lots of\ngunshots in this area tonight but how\nways away from the trail\nit's my old days in the woods remind me\nheadlamps but we're doctor eating mum\ntonight into the instant mashed potato\nsnack at camp\nbaby is good tents set up if he's gonna\ndo the inside and then get the light\nshining properly Lisa's gonna attempt\nsome baking mommy what do we got going\non here so we are going to be making\nfirst some buttermilk biscuits we have\nan outback oven or components of an\noutback oven unfortunately we were\ninterested in purchasing one but it's\ndiscontinued so Stuart was able to find\nreplacement parts we've kind of cobbled\nit together so let me take you through\nwhat we've got on the base we've got\nsome just in plain tinfoil that I\nbrought that's going to reflect the heat\nup we've got the stove you don't touch\nit you just pump it pull in it what you\ndid sorry Denise so what's your flame\nabout hard harder so we've got a burner\nand then there supposed to be a little\nmetal spacer but we're using rocks it\nwas really smart how'd you think of the\nrocks I just knew I needed to create\nspace between the pan and the burner so\nthat it doesn't burn so here's the pan\nnow we don't have the lid so what I've\nbrought is more tin foil I'm going to\nmake an other kind of tinted so first\nwe've got the Bisquick button up just\nadd water so we've got a half a cup of\nwater and I'm going to pour it into the\nflames gonna go out on I'm just going to\nmix it up in here look at the toriel\nnot bad after walking 16 miles and\nlugging all that in here right now so\nI'm hoping it's going to thicken up and\nI even brought a measuring cup it is a\nthird of a cup measure tub that's from\nour kitchen it's just very light\naluminum so why don't we check the flame\nand we'll be right back here in a minute\nyeah okay just cut the gas pumped up\nthis one to show you now this is the\nwork here that's being done you need to\ncome hiking more often yeah you really\ndo probably why backpackers pantry stop\nmaking the backpacker oven\nmaybe the dawn of the ultralight age all\nright we're gonna check in during the\nBaker after the big I can't wait well\nthere's the timer here's the timer to\ncheck in Treece moment of truth\nthey're baking can you flip them it's\nnot even something you can do when you\nbake sure you can\nyeah okay I smell they've risen wait to\ntry those soon baby baby\nsure beats mountain house so are we\ngonna try them you can try one tell us\nwhat you think and then we'll get into\nit like it's hard to hold the camera eat\na muffin biscuit oh it's really nicely\ncooked - that's fantastic\nis it hot yep it's hot that's the smell\ntest\nalright good right\npretty good for the backcountry huh you\nbring any butter well that's the end of\nday two twenty miles for Evelyn and I\nand sixteen on day one\nfor Denise picked mym up at highway 41\nand it was really cool you brought all\nthat baking stuff yes\ncould you bring butter next time please\ndon't even eat butter no a lot of waste\nhold my goodness that you carried in\nhere so uh fortunately we consumed some\nof it tough day tomorrow I'm supposed to\nbe nine but the bridge is out here over\nking gully which I'll show you tomorrow\nhere at the campsite because it was dark\nwhen we give you in because Zeppelin and\nI basically hiked from sunrise to sunset\nso we'll show you that in the morning\nbefore we head out we have to do a bit\nof a reroute so maybe somewhere probably\naround ten miles so we might sleep in a\ntiny bit just to rest and then carry on\nbut we had a nice evening\na little fire a nice dinner gunfire\nhounds literally sounds like the back\nforty of an attempt a British estate\nhere somebody released the hounds here\nthey just started howling yeah and we've\nheard lots of gunfire all day so oh you\ncan hear him I thought hunting season\nwas over but I guess I'm wrong and the\nreason I say that is because I was gonna\nhike this trail solo in the fall and the\nweekend I was going to go out they were\nhaving dog driven deer hunts for kids 17\nand under so I wasn't you can't hear\nthat but they're out there\nI can hear they're out there so anyway\nwe'll see in the morning if we live\nmorning d3 as I said as we went to sleep\nnine miles typically and probably about\n10-ish today also as I promised I'll\ngive you a little tour around camp\nthere's a tent\nlots of condensation on it this morning\nthe overnight temperatures cuz her mom\ndid her baking last night we called that\nthe kitchen a little fire a nice open\narea here water and then that's what we\nwalked in to see last night I'm actually\nnot going to rant at all other than to\nsay anyone who comes out in the woods\nshould know Leave No Trace know the\nrules in follow them that is disgusting\nsomebody already tried to clean up some\nover here I'm actually gonna pack out\nwhat I can\nso that volunteers don't have to do it\nbut really not cool just disgusting\nladies are inside packing up take you\nover here give you a quick shot or show\nyou where they're building the new\nbridge across King gully which is why we\nhave to do the reroute this morning\npretty little spot\nthere's the X the equipment order for\nthe bridge yeah just real quick\nthis is where the bridge is gonna be\nobviously there's another one of these\npieces of cement out near where we\nwalked in and there's our morning\nso everyone this morning is trying these\nold meals if you remember in our video\nof Congaree National Park I tried one of\nthese and actually Denise Denise Denise\nin East last night had two of them for\ndinner yeah so it eliminates the need\nfor a lot of water for hydration and\neven fire yeah yeah so I bought these\nfor this trail because when I first\nstarted researching this trail a few\nyears ago if you read online it says\nthere's no water source on the trail\nwell that's actually not true I mean\nthere's no hand pump water source on the\ntrail there used to be and that's\nprobably why they say that but um\nthere's plenty of water after you pass\nhalfway Creek heading west there's\nplenty of water to filter so every we're\ngonna you know let you get that out of\nthere and yeah I don't bring yourself\nnah well we'll take a sponsorship why\nnot\nso better than the instant that we\nusually poor so it is better it's like\nreal oatmeal all right\nBon Appetit we are underway lovely\nleisurely morning which was really cool\nafter such a hard day yesterday\ngorgeous day mom was just asking if she\nfelt we could get across there to save a\nmile or so\nno that would be a no I mean you\nprobably could actually but I'm not\ntoday so so back out this little trail\nwe came in last night at the actual\ntrail and 50 intersect a road and make a\nright and then we walk that up for a\nways I think a mile and for something\nlike that and then we make another right\nto read intersect the trail and then\nhead toward a car which is near Bono so\nI'm kind of probably show you much of\nthe forestry road but when we see\nsomething that we like you'll see it to\njust come from down there as I mentioned\nwhen I come up to this road and walk\nalong that way and it will eventually\nmake a left on the trail and that's\nwhere our next water cash is although\nI'm not sure we need much of it but\nwe'll take it anyway\nalways tough to see with the leaves\nthese big holes this one was covered\npretty good so everyone did a very good\njob of that kind of pointing those out\nbridge needs a little repair which is\nnot unusual lots of water but that's\npretty nice to see running water out\nhere you don't always see it\nWow how about those shots huh gorgeous\nreminds me of a little bit of Congaree\nNational Park but really neat there are\nsome cypress here actually and see them\nbut this is so pretty\nWow unexpected after days in the pine\nvery cool this is beautiful\nthis is cool come in with your canoe or\nkayak and you can paddle around here for\nI betcha miles that's really cool yeah\nwe're also talking about the amazing\npeople that bring all this wood in here\nto build these more blocks whoo you\nthink it's tough walking through in the\nbackpack on you try lugging that stuff\nin and working all day yeah yeah but\nsummers hot here\nheck it's January and it's hot forty\nfour three two go\nyeah I'm just I'm just gonna show you I\ndon't care anymore\nI don't but it's good point to bring up\nat this moment then if you made it this\nfar\nwaterproof socks I did mention it\nearlier in the video I bought these for\nthe north boundary trail where I thought\nit would be really good idea in some of\nthose dangerous boards you have to do to\nkeep our boots on but not get our feet\nwet yeah with the tread and because\nwhere they're placed in the trail\nthere's considerable hiking to do after\nyou've gone across these creeks and\nrivers so we've never because of the\nnorth boundary changes this summer we\nnever got a chance to use them so we've\nused them all three days out here and\nI'll also say the swamp fox passage it's\nvery good name it was of course named\nafter Francis Marion who fought in the\nRevolutionary slash War of Independence\nwhichever your history book said he come\nout here and hitting the swamps and the\nBritish had a heck of a time getting\nthrough this and well we are too it's\ndead\nI think no look at that fur\nthat's a doglike animal to me well this\nis yeah well look at that fur you know\nsome sort of doglike creature yeah for\nsure I'm look at that Paul that's\ndefinitely behind paw I would say of a\ndog or coyote ants on it\noh look and interestingly enough a\nshotgun shell yes we just come across a\nroad and the carnage gets better up here\nactually there's two of them there's one\nthere that's to two different spines\nThanks\ntrying to figure it out yeah this has\nbeen the wettest section of the trail by\nfar after we crossed highway 17 yeah\nthis is deep here too but very very wet\nwe've just plowed through it because\nwe've got you know mile change left and\nwaterproof socks so not really too\nworried but so a but very very wet the\nsection it's not always this wet to be\nhonest if you're watching this trying to\nplan a hike it's actually not always\nthis wet now we've had a ton of rain\nlike I said earlier and like we're\nsitting our year-end video we've tried\nto get out weekend after weekend in all\nsense rain so lots of water around\nalright we're looking for mile marker 46\nand then one last push - 47 46 well\nlet's go find out\nevie it looks like you're walking on\nwater yeah I could use a miracle right\nnow if we get to the trailhead be good\none last little kick from the trail at\nthe very end or if you're going in the\nopposite direction hiking toward and AH\nI'm the ocean this will greet you in\nmild number one yeah I mean seriously\nlook around yeah very cool alright we'll\nsee if the trailhead we're all just\nstanding here because we just came\nthrough that I showed you that area we\njust came through and you'll see a\nmarker there and the trail actually\nveers - you're sort of your left or\nstraight ahead when you come into that\nsection we actually saw an old marker\nand you can't see it anywhere on video\nbut it's over there - off to the right\nyeah so we went right and then there was\nnothing so I just want to mention that I\nknow we said we see the trailhead but it\nis tricky after you get to that swamp\nbut the rule is and you know it if you\ncan't see another marker or you think\nyou're off the trail go back to the\nmarker you last saw and look around and\nthat's exactly what we did and then we\nfound the trail again so don't get\npanicked just go back to the last marker\nyou saw and look around take your time I\nsee it I see the trailhead and I see\nEvelyn and Olivia's car like a nickname\nat blueberry cuz it's blue few other\ncars here today to hold baby 47 miles\nfor Evie and I and 18 less for Mom no 22\nless from I'm sorry sorry mom okay we're\ngonna take this off and find out how is\nthe hike\nwell 47 miles on the swamp fox passage\nlongest of the Palmetto trail and this\nshould we decided not to do that\nhow's the hike 10-point thing but we're\nstill going to talk about things and so\nI thought no no no no I thought it was\ngood I mean we did in three days\nthat was pretty tricky it just I have\nreally do it in four yeah do it in four\nmy legs\nI mean especially if you're like short\nlike it's just hard you know I think you\nreally want to like appreciate like the\nnature around it and everything like\nthat I say do it in fourth but um even\nthough we did see a lot of like\nconditions that one necessarily know\nankle-deep and mud and stuff like that I\nstill think you know not all the\nconditions are like this it's not always\nlike this\nand so they do think the trail\nmaintenance does a good job yeah\nabsolutely so yeah we want to thank\neveryone at the palmetto trials they\nhelped us plan this hike because the\nMaps need a little you know new updating\nand stuff and they're doing work all the\ntime in there but thanks for your help\nand being out there making the trails\nfun and safe to use that's it so until\nnext time thanks for watching"
