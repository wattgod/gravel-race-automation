      "description": "The Crushers is an Enhanced Gravel Race that takes place in the Beautiful Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The term enhanced is used to stress the difficult terrain that promises a grueling yet exhilarting experience like any other. This event has several distances and the longest known iteration is about 325 miles. The course changes every year and spans a mix of gravel roads, rugged two-tracks and pavement with spans of steep incline that will require even the most experienced riders to walk all their gear several miles up and down hill. The course changes every year and rout information is provide 1-2 months prior to the mass start. This is considered \"part of the fun\" as it ensures no two crushers are the same.  \n\nThe Crusher has both a Scheduled mass start and a expedition event that people can run on their own. In either case the event is self guided with no formal aid stations or support although you may find aid form your own community, volunteers or other riders. Riders are provided a field guide which provides details of the event, complete with a gear list and required checkpoints that must be knocked off to complete the event. The event aims to embrace the spirit of adventure and exploration while seeing what people are capable of by pushing them to their absolute limit. \n\nEverybody comes to this event for their own reason, some to race, some to avoid therapy and others to have an adventure. Regardless of your reason the even organizers want you to know its you vs The Crusher. Those who quit mid event have to text #quiter to the race directors as a cruel but comical way force riders to sit down and admit defeat.\n\nThis event along with the \"Polar Roll\" and the Marji Gesick\" make up the 906 Adventure Teams endurance Trilogy known as the Triple Crown. The biggest bike adventure seekers who complete these three events are added into the \"Hall of Pain\" and become eligible to attend an annual \"secret event\"\n\nThe Crusher is a bucket list of gravel races that draws attention to the beauty and challenges of Michigans Upper Peninsula built on the idea of pushing your limits in every aspect of life which we try to capture on the Type 2 Fun Channel.\n\nIn the words of The Crusher's Race Director Todd Poquette - \"There is no finish\" line\"\n\nLink to some recommended gear from our guests across a variety of activities!\nhttps://app.rockporch.com/Profile/Type2Fun",

      "description": "TLDR: CRUSHED IT! From \"Oh $#*!\" to \"HELL YEAH!\" at The Crusher!\n\nFolks, I've had a few days to process 54 miles of pure Upper Peninsula grit at The Crusher, and honestly, it still feels like a wild fever dream. But the numbers don't lie: I absolutely annihilated my estimated finish time, crossing that line in just 10 hours and 25 minutes! That's almost 8 hours faster than I thought possible! This isn't just about finishing; it's a testament to embracing the \"fail fast, fail up\" mindset we champion.\n\nMy journey to The Crusher was paved with challenges, from personal battles with ADHD/OCD and addiction to the heartbreaking loss of my brother this year. Life throws punches, and believe me, I've taken a few. My experience at Polar Roll earlier this year was a prime example \u2013 I failed. Hard. But instead of letting it define me, that \"failure\" became the fuel for clarity and fierce determination. It taught me invaluable lessons about preparation and resilience, proving that true growth only comes when you learn to fall forward. We all fail; it's how we get back up and share those lessons that truly matters.\n\nThe drive to Copper Harbor, the pre-race massage, even the pre-dawn kielbasa and bacon fuel-up \u2013 every detail was part of the build-up. But the real magic happened on the trails. My strategy evolved from complex data points to simple truths: \n \n * Go slow, enjoy the ride, take pictures!\n * Eat snacks, meet people and share stories.\n * Be the reason someone else crosses the finish line.\"\n\nThis philosophy connected me with incredible humans on the course. From Barry Tilson, who literally shared his campsite, to Derrick, who found my phone on the Highlands Trail (talk about a collective \"oh sh*t\" moment turning into pure relief!). Every shared water bottle, every cheer, every laugh with strangers and friends alike underscored the power of community.\n\nThe Keweenaw Point and Highlands trails were pure joy \u2013 meticulously manicured and insanely fast, allowing for \"giggling and shouting\" sessions as I pumped through technical sections. This ride wasn't just about physical endurance; it was a vibrant reminder that the greatest reward in these adventures isn't just the personal accomplishment, but the connections forged and the stories shared. The trail builders deserve all the beers! I've got a ridiculous amount of GoPro footage (fair warning for colorful language!) that captures these incredible moments and the amazing people I met. I tried to make sure everyone was represented.\n\nAt Crash Test Cleveland, I believe every challenge, every \"failure,\" is an opportunity for a breakthrough. My Crusher experience is living proof. What \"failures\" have taught you the most? Share your stories below! Let's build this community of resilience together!\n#CrashTestCleveland #TheCrusher #MountainBiking #EmbraceFailure #Community #LearnFromExperience #Grit #CopperHarbor #Adventure #GrowthMindset",

Not that way.\nSing me the song of my people.\n&gt;&gt; You got it, guys.\n&gt;&gt; Hell yeah. This is worth the detour.\n&gt;&gt; You want a photo?\n&gt;&gt; That would be awesome. I can do the same\nthing. Holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\nCan't get us together.\n&gt;&gt; All right, I'm going to get you without\nthe sun blinding you.\n&gt;&gt; I'm going to get you with the sun in\nyour back.\n&gt;&gt; I'm going back up. Get the\n&gt;&gt; That's going to look awesome.\n&gt;&gt; You want me to get one?\n&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. Absolutely.\nIf we ain't here for the photos, why are\nwe here? I mean, we ain't here because\nwe love it, right?\nThank you, sir.\n&gt;&gt; All right, moving on.\n&gt;&gt; Only another 52 miles to go. I'm a mile\nin. Um, first three and a half miles are\nup Rockaway Mountain. It's on the road.\nI'm basically\npushing the real steep stuff just to\nstretch my legs and get warmed up. Um,\nthe goal here is to not push real hard\nearly, take as much time as I need to\nfinish the course. I think I have till\n10:30 in the morning tomorrow. So, about\n7 o'clock now.\nSo,\nplenty of plenty of time. No need to\nhurry and rush. Enjoy the scenery.\nEnjoy the weather. Uh, it's a bit\nhumid,\nbut the sky is pretty clear. There's\ngoing to be clouds coming in. I'm\nexpecting rain a little bit later, but\nshouldn't be anything egregious.\nTemp should be in the 70s\nor,\nyou know, mid60s\nby the high of the day.\nBut yeah, things are good.\nFeeling strong.\nUh, breakfast this morning was\na huge piece of kabasa\nand lots of electrolyte mix and a full\ncourt of\nallout nutrition, which is my secret\nweapon.\nUh, the pre-workout gets me amped up,\nfeeling good. More in my water bottle\nfor later. That's the stuff that'll perk\nme up. Keeps my muscles strong.\nMore climbing.\nHaven't even\nreally got all that far yet. Had a\nreally weird dream last night. Like a\nfreaking out that I was\nlate to the starting line.\nwas on some sort of bus\ntrying to get to the starting line\nbecause I left the campsite to go take a\nshower.\nAnd uh\nturns out I woke up exactly at 5:00 a.m.\nrealized\nit's just a bad dream. That's the kind\nof weird stuff that goes through your\nhead. all the planning you do and then\nyou sleep through your alarm.\nBut I got up, hopped in the Jeep. Uh\nBarry, who I'm sharing a campsite with,\nwas on the 175, so he went off at 5:00\na.m.\n&gt;&gt; He was up at 5 4:30\nand uh\n&gt;&gt; said good luck to him on the way.\nWent to Fort Wilkins,\n&gt;&gt; got a shower,\n&gt;&gt; did my morning constitution,\nate a kabassi on the way back,\nand uh then got all my stuff ready. Got\nto the starting line with about 5\nminutes to spare. Took a few deep\nbreaths, appreciated where I was at, and\noff we go.\nThis is going to be hard. Stay there.\nI'm going to take a photo.\n&gt;&gt; You got the right idea with the hat on.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, I lost the visor.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, hey.\nOh, you know.\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n&gt;&gt; Hang on. One more.\n&gt;&gt; Y\n&gt;&gt; perfect.\n&gt;&gt; All right, guys.\nWhat's your names?\nAll right, guys. I'll post it.\n&gt;&gt; A\n&gt;&gt; You're welcome. The one thing I need to\ndo is to get my glasses clean when I get\nto the checkpoint here because they're\nfogging up and I can't see [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\nOh, downhill speed.\nShort lived.\nBit of rain coming in off Lake Superior.\nkeep things cool and also keep things\ndamp. Were we supposed to take the trail\nor the road?\n&gt;&gt; Are you in the 100 or 40?\n&gt;&gt; Uh 40.\n&gt;&gt; Um I'm not certain. 100 went down this\nway.\n&gt;&gt; Have fun.\n&gt;&gt; Enjoy.\nMy map says stay on the stay on the\nroad. So I'm following the GPS.\nI want to jinx it,\nbut\nthe creek is gone in the rear.\nAnd I don't know if it's the extra wax\nor lubing the pivots or just having\nSpencer at West End put his magic hands\non it, but\nbike is running solid,\nsilent,\nshifting really good. It feels light.\nand very comfortable. I like the bar\nruns. Even though they're probably going\nto be a liability in\ntrees when it's narrow, they work good\nfor the climbing, giving you different\nhand positions.\nAnyway, still not to the first\ncheckpoint. That's about a mile off. But\nthe road's ridable, just cool. And you\ngot hella views. Look at that.\n&gt;&gt; Distance 4.0 miles. Duration 45 minutes\n56 seconds.\n&gt;&gt; God, that's gorgeous.\nshort\nshort-lived momentum,\nbut it carries you mostly up the hill.\nSo, big guy techniques, pedal fast,\ncarry weight, conserve momentum, use the\nterrain effectively\nand then slow and walk.\n&gt;&gt; Keep that heart rate below 140.\nWe got to go ride through all that\non your left.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, that's enough.\nTrying to use the terrain to my\nadvantage.\nThis is no advantage here.\n&gt;&gt; No, none.\n&gt;&gt; Up at the top, it loops around.\n&gt;&gt; And then there's a sign off to the\nright.\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that would suck to uh\n&gt;&gt; Miss do all this work. Thank you so\nmuch.\nBathrooms.\nAh,\n&gt;&gt; that was a lot of fun.\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; Oh my god.\n&gt;&gt; Your definition of fun sucks, buddy.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it does.\n&gt;&gt; Don't worry, we're getting paid off.\n&gt;&gt; That's what everyone at work tells me\nwhen I take PTO off for this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\n&gt;&gt; The [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is wrong with you?\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.

Fast.\n&gt;&gt; You're saying fast, wrong?\n&gt;&gt; Oh, was that fast? Yeah,\n&gt;&gt; you're so close. But\n&gt;&gt; at least I didn't turn around. I saw\nthree people now going back down the\nhill.\n&gt;&gt; Well, now you got downhill for like two\nmiles.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, cheese snacks. Anybody want some\ncheese?\n&gt;&gt; Ready to go.\n&gt;&gt; Right, buddy.\n&gt;&gt; Last [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] for Miles.\n&gt;&gt; Beats peeing in the woods. I'm going to\ntry to ride between the raindrops.\n&gt;&gt; Good luck.\nHeat. Heat.\nI'm good.\nAll right, we're about to get off the\neasy stuff.\nAll right, the easy shit's done.\nLet's get the hard stuff.\nTurn right.\n&gt;&gt; Now we're on the real gravel.\nThis is where it's going to get tough.\nThis is where I have to really conserve\nenergy,\nnot burn too many matches.\nGo nice and slow. I'm sure it gets worse\nthan this, but this is actually pretty\nnice.\n&gt;&gt; I'm going to walk as much as I can. Oh,\nyeah.\n&gt;&gt; That's why I wore hiking shoes.\nHeart rate 147.\nLap 10 701.\n&gt;&gt; Average speed 8.7.\n&gt;&gt; Average power 107.\n&gt;&gt; All good. Yep.\nSnacks.\nYeah, according to the map, getting\nclose to the second top of the\nelevation. So, should be a little bit\nmore downhill\nfor now.\nWe're starting to see some of the\nwetter parts of the trail.\nIt's 8:00 a.m.\nBeen out here for an hour and a half.\nCovered maybe 10 miles or so. Hit the\nfirst checkpoint\noff the road onto the two track now.\nStill feeling pretty good.\nWorking on keeping my heart rate low,\nnot pedaling too hard. Just using good\ntechnique and\nclimbing.\nStaying on the bike, keeping moving.\nThat's the ticket.\nSo, what way were you trying to think\nabout when you were on your bike? Right\nhere.\n&gt;&gt; You good?\n&gt;&gt; We just got to adjust his dropper. And I\nalways I always [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] this up. I forget\nwhich way is which.\n&gt;&gt; All right. Good luck, guys.\n&gt;&gt; I appreciate you.\n&gt;&gt; Keep moving.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n&gt;&gt; slow climbing.\nBut otherwise, nice road, man. This is\nactually really ridable. I'm saying that\nnow. And they do know that the further\nin we get\nthe more egregious it'll get. But\nthis is uh\ndare I say enjoyable.\nOh,\nand there we get our\nnice little mud crossing.\nFinally, a little bit of speed.\nOh, and there's a hill.\nEnhanced gravel for sure.\nSomebody's stopping for a poop break.\nMaybe almost 11 and 1/2 miles in. I'm\nfeeling warmed up.\nStill feeling strong.\nLittle over 12 miles.\nSpeed's picking up nice and flat here.\nPaddling with good power, good cadence.\nKeep my heart rate under control.\nNeil, how's it going?\n&gt;&gt; Good. How are you? Good.\n&gt;&gt; [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] awesome.\nYou got this.\n&gt;&gt; I think it's snack time.\n&gt;&gt; Everything good?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Just trying to get my bag\nfrom bumping my tire.\n&gt;&gt; That was really cool.\n&gt;&gt; I was I was expecting a lot worse than\nthat. And I know it gets worse from\nhere, but\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n&gt;&gt; I think it's about the same. A few mud\nholes on the road.\n&gt;&gt; No, that was that was a big\n&gt;&gt; just keep peding. Just keep peding.\n12.82 miles according to my thing.\n&gt;&gt; No,\n&gt;&gt; never pass up free water.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, so they had to make a big loop when\nwe left. I went around the corner and\nhit that downhill and just let it eat.\n&gt;&gt; As long as you get the sign, I don't\nthink they're going to care if you\nactually did the loop or not. But you\nknow,\n&gt;&gt; get them out.\n&gt;&gt; They're on mountain bikes and fatties.\n&gt;&gt; I got a little bit of a rolling\nadvantage with Fargo.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, you know, with all this\nweight, we take advantage of the\ndownhills. Like I'm I'm heavy, so I\nconserve momentum. I just crank on the\ndownhills, get as And like I'm passing\npeople. I'm just pedaling my ass off in\n12th gear, just, you know, passing on\nthe left, passing on the left, and just\ngetting as far up the hill. And then of\ncourse they're passing me on the climb.\nSo\n&gt;&gt; it's really heartbreaking when the guy\nthat's doing the 50 no fun run is pass\nI'm spinning climbing croc. He's running\npast me. I'm like\n&gt;&gt; really\n&gt;&gt; get the water nozzle on there.\n&gt;&gt; Salt stick electrolyte cheese. I learned\nabout these before to Margie. They're\nthe only reason I finished.\n&gt;&gt; I have that stuff in here.\n&gt;&gt; It's a electrolyte mix. I get a bulk bag\nof it for 30 bucks. It makes like a\nthousand servings.\n&gt;&gt; All that go. I know what you're talking\nabout.\n&gt;&gt; So, I mix that with creatine, beta\nalanine, and um uh ketones for energy. I\nI do carnivore. So, I basically burn\nfat. I literally just eat pure fat.\n&gt;&gt; Because that's what my body burns right\nnow. I've lost 212 pounds doing that.\nSo, Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, dude, that's awesome. Yeah, it is.\nSo, I I kind of kind of stick to what's\nworking.\n&gt;&gt; Hell yeah.\n&gt;&gt; If I don't have if I don't have the\nketones and I don't have I don't have my\nmy my metabolism amped, I bonk out.\n&gt;&gt; So, I got to keep feeding myself like\nridiculous amounts of fat. Like, my\nwife's a dietitian. When she told me,\nshe's like, \"Look, if you really want to\nlose weight, you got to go carnivore.\"\nAnd I'm like, \"You're telling me I need\nto eat five pounds of bacon a week?\"\nShe's, \"No, I'm telling you you need to\neat a pound a day. Seven pounds.\" I'm\nlike, \"Are you kidding me?\" She's like,\n\"Oh, and steak.\"\n&gt;&gt; See my wife pop pre-diabetic.\n&gt;&gt; I was type two. I'm not anymore.\n&gt;&gt; And so I've been regular soda is a thing\nof the past. Alcohol consumption. We\nalmost didn't drink a whole lot to begin\nwith.\n&gt;&gt; And cut the carbs, cut the alcohol, cut\nthe sugar.\n&gt;&gt; The hardest thing to give up by far, the\nsugar in the morning coffee. That's why\n&gt;&gt; Oh, hell yeah.\nThat's awesome.\n&gt;&gt; Not possible, but I think that kid is\ncrying coming up Rockway Mountain.\n&gt;&gt; Do I want to quit?\n&gt;&gt; Still going.\n&gt;&gt; You know, everybody asked me like, \"How\ndid you do it?\" I started with one\nthing. Every couple of weeks, I would do\na little bit more until it was a habit.\nWell, you're going to diet to lose\nweight, right? No, I'm like, \"No, I'm\ngoing to change the way that I eat for\nthe rest of my life so that I can stay\nhealthy, do the things I want to do.\"\nSo, basically just making all those\nchanges, one thing at a time.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I got jerky and stuff on the trail\nwater.\n&gt;&gt; And you keep selling me on the jerky.\n&gt;&gt; Cleveland Mountain Bike Association.\nYeah. Ohio.\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n&gt;&gt; We run a 906 at Adventure Adventure\nTeam. Not Cleveland, but the shenanigans\ngroup. We also run the the chaos station\nfor Margie. So grilled cheese, that's\nus.\n&gt;&gt; Chaos in Jackson Park.\n&gt;&gt; So it's a purple and pink shenanigans\ntent. So if you come through there and\nyou get a grilled cheese, we're making\nwe make roughly 1,800 uh a Margie.\n&gt;&gt; People are grabbing five, six at a time.\nIt's crazy. We just have people from,\nyou know, 24 hours a day just making\ngrilled cheese. It's insane. And we have\nso much like so many like 50 gallon cans\njust filled with bread and filled with\ncheese and filled with you know butter\nand everything\n&gt;&gt; and so very much appreciated.\n&gt;&gt; I did the 50 last year\n&gt;&gt; and got to Jackson Park\n&gt;&gt; at\n10:30 11:00.\n&gt;&gt; it was making okay time.\n&gt;&gt; Got uh grilled cheese from your crew\nwhich I ham and grilled cheese with ham\nin it. I've never heard of that before.\nIt's a hot ham and cheese sandwich.\n&gt;&gt; That's it.\n&gt;&gt; And boy, that was good.\n&gt;&gt; Then I came back when I hit it the\nsecond time.\n&gt;&gt; Uh the wheels had come off the bus.\nI was\n&gt;&gt; dealing with leg cramps. Could not eat\nor drink enough to fix the problem.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And I think I gobbled down three grilled\ncheese sandwiches then.\n&gt;&gt; Dude, I had six. So I I'm with you. I\ndid the run cuz I separated a shoulder.\nThey wouldn't let me ride.\n&gt;&gt; So I switched to the run. And I don't\nrun. I mean, like I'll run if there's\nbarbecue or a bear chasing me, but you\nknow, that's about it.\n&gt;&gt; But I do long distance hiking, so I just\nI just treated it as a as a as a track\nessentially. And it took me 13 hours,\nbut I had a blast, man.\n&gt;&gt; And then when I got to the end,\n&gt;&gt; the mini margie or the\n&gt;&gt; the mini.\n&gt;&gt; So, if you did the 50 and 13 hours\nhiking, it took 22.\n&gt;&gt; And I I got my hiking miles in and\nround,\n&gt;&gt; of course. Well, the thing is is on a\nbike I I I went back and rode all that\nstuff and then rode it for Margie Camp\nand I'm like it absolutely sucks to hike\nthat because there's no flow. You have\nto hike everything up and down. There's\nno there's no roll in it. When you're on\na bike, you get to roll some of that\nstuff and it's fun.\n&gt;&gt; You get you get some recovery time. It\nwas a lot easier on a bike.\n&gt;&gt; So, I'm I'm doing the 50 this year.\n&gt;&gt; Who are you guys? I\n&gt;&gt; bunch of friends from Oshkosh,\nWisconsin.\n&gt;&gt; Oshkosh, Wisconsin. I spent my childhood\nthere up at the Oshkosh air show.\n&gt;&gt; Well, there you go.\n&gt;&gt; Like I lived there pretty much in the\nsummer with my dad.\n&gt;&gt; Awesome. And what's your name?\n&gt;&gt; Elena. And your name?\n&gt;&gt; Dude,\n&gt;&gt; and Rob\n&gt;&gt; drinking a beer.\n&gt;&gt; Already had one.\n&gt;&gt; That's it. When I got to the beach\nparty, I sat down and I I sat down for\nan hour and had three beers with Danny\nand we just chatted about like\n&gt;&gt; those guys\n&gt;&gt; like in the middle of nowhere out in the\nwoods in the last section around.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. It's 11 miles before the finish.\n&gt;&gt; I came stumbling into that middle of the\nnight.\n&gt;&gt; Just a huge party, isn't it?\n&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. There. And a guy just walked\nup to me and he's looks at me and I he\nwas there for a while before my brain\nrealized human.\n&gt;&gt; He's like, \"Turn your headlight off.\"\n&gt;&gt; Okay. food and I couldn't figure it out.\nSo he turns it off.\n&gt;&gt; Thank you so much.\n&gt;&gt; Grabs a hot dog and a glass of some\ndrink. And he's like, \"Drink this.\"\n&gt;&gt; Okay. I drink and he eat this. And he\nstood there while I ate the hot dog.\n&gt;&gt; He's like, \"Okay, at least now you're\ngoing to survive.\n&gt;&gt; Now you're good.\"\n&gt;&gt; So much fun. And then on the polar roll,\nI ran into him again. And he kept\nfeeding me fireball. I was ready to\nquit. And he's like, \"No, no, you're\njust have another fireball.\" finally got\nme drunk enough and he's like, \"All\nright, go cuz it's easier from here.\"\nAnd of course he lied. And then I come\nback around that thing and I'm like,\n\"That sucked. I'm going to quit.\" He's\nlike, \"No, you're not. Here, have\nanother fireball.\" All right, it is\ntime.\n0.3 miles.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, that's gorgeous.\nAll good.\nSoldier onward.\nCheckpoint.\n&gt;&gt; All righty.\n&gt;&gt; It matters what way we're facing.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, that's it.\n&gt;&gt; Here we go.

I'm like, you\nguys are nuts, man. It's a little early\nfor that.\n&gt;&gt; 40 or 100?\n&gt;&gt; They were on the 40. It's\n&gt;&gt; a lot of calories, though. It's\n&gt;&gt; good carbs, I guess.\n&gt;&gt; This is going a lot faster than I\nexpected.\n&gt;&gt; You're doing great.\nI figured it was going to\n&gt;&gt; No, I'm perfectly good cuz I just walked\nthrough the water and cooled off.\n&gt;&gt; It is going to warm up a little.\n&gt;&gt; It's all right.

I'm here to support my\nhusband and my son, Chuck and EMTT.\n&gt;&gt; Those are the guys on the tandem, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Keep passing them.\n&gt;&gt; They're doing awesome.\n&gt;&gt; How long you have they been biking? Uh\nEMTT is brand new to biking. He recently\nlearned to ride a bike maybe within the\npast year.\n&gt;&gt; You put him on a tandem.\n&gt;&gt; That's why he's on a tandem and not on\nhis own bike.\n&gt;&gt; How old is he?\n&gt;&gt; Nine.\n&gt;&gt; Nine. All right. Good deal.\n&gt;&gt; Start him young.\n&gt;&gt; Yes. And my husband know he's been Oh my\ngoodness. 30 years of biking.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. I came across them just as they\nwere going across one of the deep the\ndeep parts of water. And I think they\nwere contemplating what the best\nstrategy was.\n&gt;&gt; That sounds like them. Analytical.\n&gt;&gt; Analytical. Yeah. Me, I just plowed\nthrough it.\n&gt;&gt; Figured if there's a rock, I'm just\ngoing to go for a swim.\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for the water. It was awesome.\nHighlands Trail now, which\nhas some rocky stuff and I feel like\nblowing the match is just ripping up\nthis. So, I'm walking a lot of it. I'm\n44 miles in this point. Still feel good,\nbut no need to blow it out.\nThis is\nsupposedly the most technical part.\nAnd it looks it some rock rolls,\nlots of mud, questionable footing.\nJust kind of roll what you can\nflow\nsome of it.\nWe still got nine miles to go.\nriding smart.\nTake a free trail when I can get it.\nIt's a nice view.\nStill a bunch of fog on the lake.\nThis is a fast section of the Highland\nTrail. That is a lot of free trail cuz\nit's mostly in the south,\nbut it is very much\nexposed\non the right side.\nLap 47 1244.\n&gt;&gt; Average power 123.\n&gt;&gt; Average speed 7.7.\n&gt;&gt; Heart rate 124.\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\nstopping to take a break.\nTaking a bit of the scenery here.\nOh, wow.\nSo this is the highlands.\nPretty steep drop off down there.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this view sucks.\n&gt;&gt; Horrible, isn't it? It's awful to\n&gt;&gt; be out here.\n&gt;&gt; Well, you're out here with 400 other\ncrushers.\nGuys, we got some descent here for a bit\non the back side of the Highland Trail.\nYou can ride it like a real trail.\nWow, that was weird. I don't know what\nthat was.\n&gt;&gt; Coach Dave is officially unofficially\ndoing the crusher.\n&gt;&gt; Something like that.\n&gt;&gt; We are. All right, dude.\nGrand Rapids Area Adventure Team.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. I'm with uh Cleveland Area Metrop\nMountain Bike Association.\n&gt;&gt; And we're we work with Shenanigans and\nwe do the Cleveland adventure team.\n&gt;&gt; So,\n&gt;&gt; very familiar Shenanigans, especially\ntheir uh food shenanigans.\n&gt;&gt; Much appreciated.\n&gt;&gt; The Chaos Station.\n&gt;&gt; The Chaos Station. I\n&gt;&gt; think they make something like 1,800\ngrilled cheese for Margie.\n&gt;&gt; It's a lot and I've had a few of them.\nSo thanks Matt and crew\nRiding this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] blind.\nJust having faith\nI can ride through it.\nA little squirly.\nThe brown pebbles,\nbig white bars.\n&gt;&gt; In a quarter mile, turn right.\nMiles 8 hours 44 minutes 49.\nThis is my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] jam\n&gt;&gt; except for the climbs.\n&gt;&gt; 47.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you're about you. You You didn't\ngo far off course then.\n&gt;&gt; No, not 49 miles.\n&gt;&gt; But I rode to I rode to the start from\n&gt;&gt; that's probably what that is. I don't\nknow if you did enough, but man,\nI was prepared for 32 minutes. So,\n&gt;&gt; are you familiar? And I see the berry\nbottle. So, are you Grand Rapids area?\n&gt;&gt; I know. Are you?\n&gt;&gt; Just remember Todd lies.\n&gt;&gt; Don't worry about the elevation cuz it's\nnever accurate.\n&gt;&gt; The mileage is never accurate.\n&gt;&gt; And he's a sadist, too.\n&gt;&gt; That's right. Yeah,\n&gt;&gt; but he still wants the best.\n&gt;&gt; Well, he knows. He knows you're capable\nof doing it. That's why\n&gt;&gt; that's true.\n&gt;&gt; I get that. I do that.\n&gt;&gt; And you know what?\n&gt;&gt; After finish,\n&gt;&gt; all of that is like so right and correct\nin the world.\n&gt;&gt; I think\n&gt;&gt; we don't challenge ourselves enough.\nAnd life is very easy for us if we want\nit to be.\nAnd I've learned that, you know, you can\npush yourself way past your limits.\n&gt;&gt; And uh\n&gt;&gt; and I I started at 412 pounds.\n&gt;&gt; Wow. How long?\n&gt;&gt; 2022.\n&gt;&gt; Cuz it's not I'm not on a sprint here.\n&gt;&gt; I'm on a journey. Are you having\ntrouble? You want some help?\nI can\n&gt;&gt; I can't see very well with my contacts\nin so I obviously open it the wrong way.\n&gt;&gt; I like I like\n&gt;&gt; I always have trouble with those.\n&gt;&gt; Oh god. Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n&gt;&gt; Well, that is wonderful.\n&gt;&gt; Very inspiring.\n&gt;&gt; That's what got me into biking, too.\n&gt;&gt; 40 lbs lighter than when I started.\n&gt;&gt; I don't know. Same thing.\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n&gt;&gt; The worst is seeing pictures of myself.\nYeah, you don't\n&gt;&gt; you don't see yourself from an outside\nperspective. But I mean, the best thing\nI can do is like pay it forward. Like,\nyou know, I see big guys out here. And\nI'm like, you know, our whole\n&gt;&gt; our whole thing is preserving momentum.\nLike, we got to go fast downhill and we\ngot to pedal like rabbits to get uphill.\nWhat's your names and where are you guys\nfrom?\n&gt;&gt; Oh, I'm Mandy. I live in Marquette.\n&gt;&gt; Marquette. Oh, nice. All right. So, you\nuh you know the trails around there,\nright? No,\n&gt;&gt; I know them very well.

Well, I ended up with\ntwo flat tires and basically ducking out\nthe last 18 miles. I I was I was out I\nwas out late and it was just a mess. So,\num it was a learning experience for\nsure. But\n&gt;&gt; um\n&gt;&gt; I didn't finish, but I got to drink\nscotch with Todd at the finish line, so\nthat's\n&gt;&gt; arguably that's even better. Even\nbetter.\n&gt;&gt; All right, I'm on the Quinoa Point\nTrail. I just passed East Bluff. stopped\nand dropped off some of the carbs.\nGlad I marked that toilet there on my\nGPS route. Was very helpful.\nBody does not like carbs. And I'm on the\nhome stretch.\nCouple of miles and we're done.\npumpable terrain. That's good.\nStill riding well. Still strong.\nFeel\nlike I did a good job managing\nenergy and cadence and heart rate.\nAccomplished everything I wanted. Not\nquite done yet,\non the home stretch for sure.\nDefinitely uh feeling the power\nthese last few miles.\n&gt;&gt; Distance 49.0 0 miles.

I didn't\nride at all really this week,\nbut the legs are fresh.\nEven though I'm walking now and talking,\nI'm not blown out. I feel like I got\nstamina.\nFeel like I got enough\npower. Or I could go do another 10 or 15\nmiles\neven to this crap\nbecause\nyou get the free trail every now and\nthen\nand it uh\nkeeps you moving moving forward.\nI know the Margie training was super\nhelpful. Got me crash course on this\nbike, which is what I needed.\nI won't need my lights next time for\nthis. If I do the 40 again,\nI don't know. Maybe I should try the 100\nnext year. We'll see.\nWe are just riding a rock spine here.\nBrock lobster.\nWoo! Free zip tie.\nAlways something good to have.\nI know I'm getting stupid when I stop to\npick up a zip tie.\nDoug,\n&gt;&gt; are you going to keep riding?\n&gt;&gt; I'm uh I'll walk with you guys for a\nbit. I'm just kind of I'm basically like\ntaking all the free trail I can get and\nthen just walking the stuff that I just\ndon't want to risk it on.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, you should probably go in front of\nus then.\n&gt;&gt; No, you go. Go ahead.

Good.\n&gt;&gt; I just cranked the last miles.\n&gt;&gt; Good time.\n&gt;&gt; Oh yeah. This this was awesome. You\nknow, the the beginning of it on the\nroad was kind of a nice warm up and\ngetting up to Brockway Mountain and\ncruising down the backside. and going\nacross kind of the spine of the\npeninsula was cool.\n&gt;&gt; And then the back roads were kind of\njust like\n&gt;&gt; just bear down and just get it done.\n&gt;&gt; But once I got to the single track,\n&gt;&gt; that was my jam. Like I I rode\n&gt;&gt; rode really well. Like I feel like I\nredeemed myself from the polar.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, that trail section is the Highland.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, Highland Highland I\ndefinitely I definitely like was like\nI'm going to live to fight another day\nand walked a bunch of it,\n&gt;&gt; but I took all the free trail I could\nget, you know, and Margie Camp like\nreally just, you know, kind of got me\nenough time on this bike. So,\n&gt;&gt; you're going to do your checkpoints over\nthere.\n&gt;&gt; All right, cool.\n&gt;&gt; Food and beer is over there.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, I am so in. Thank you, sir.\nNice job, bud.\n&gt;&gt; Find your bike.\n&gt;&gt; No. No. That's a burner.\nWhat's in your hand?\n&gt;&gt; No, no, this is uh I rode I did ride\nwith GPS\nand I did Garmin and I took photos on my\nother phone.\nDid you?\n&gt;&gt; So, unless somebody brings it back.\n&gt;&gt; Stop anywhere here yet or go to the\nbathroom or something?\n&gt;&gt; No, I know exactly where I lost it. It's\nback. It's back on Highland.\n&gt;&gt; Highland.\n&gt;&gt; The Highland Trail.\nUm,\nit's possible to still come in. We've\nhad all sorts of stuff brought in.\nLike you felt it flop or or you left it\nsitting\n&gt;&gt; didn't zip the pocket after I put it\nback in.\n&gt;&gt; Wow. You\n&gt;&gt; started a shr.\n&gt;&gt; Well, we should wait and see if somebody\nbrings it.\n&gt;&gt; Or if it's like Margie, you have to back\nand find your phone. The problem is I\ndon't know how to locate it without\nhaving any kind of access here.\n&gt;&gt; I mean I could\n&gt;&gt; if there's service I can use find my\nphone.\n&gt;&gt; Son of a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] So the GPS's two GPS's\nwon't work.\n&gt;&gt; I might be able to pull\n&gt;&gt; You won't have\n&gt;&gt; I might be able to pull checkpoint stuff\noff of this.\n&gt;&gt; Oh yeah,\n&gt;&gt; the GoPro.\n&gt;&gt; Will you be in it though? Did you do a\nselfie with it?\n&gt;&gt; Well, I mean I'm wearing it. Yeah,\n&gt;&gt; that see if he has any\nkick to Todd.\n&gt;&gt; I'll go ask.\n&gt;&gt; He never came and checked in with us\neither.\n&gt;&gt; So, did you check in with\n&gt;&gt; Okay. Okay, you did come eventually. I\nmust have stepped away.\n&gt;&gt; I can't locate it without having\nservice. But I used Ride with GPS on a\nburner phone. I used this. Plus, I\nprobably have GoPro footage from all the\ncheckpoints.\n&gt;&gt; Um,\nso unless somebody brings the phone in\n&gt;&gt; or I can somehow get access and find\nwhere it's at and go get it.\n&gt;&gt; So, is this a phone?\n&gt;&gt; It is. Okay.\n&gt;&gt; But I don't have the photos on this one.\n&gt;&gt; Got it.\n&gt;&gt; I've got ride with GPS on this and I've\ngot Garmin on this.\n&gt;&gt; Got it. So, I have the tracks and then I\nshould have GoPro footage, but I don't\nhave the selfies on this cuz I was\ntaking pictures of everything else. But\nat least I have video that I was there.\n&gt;&gt; So, you need service to find where the\nphone was.\n&gt;&gt; Do we know that it\n&gt;&gt; assuming Well, actually, if the phone\ndoesn't have service, I'm [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Do we know if a phone was turned\nin?\n&gt;&gt; Oh, it would be\n&gt;&gt; not had a phone turned in. It would be\nit would be guys coming in after me.\n&gt;&gt; I'm pretty sure I know exactly where\nit's at, but\n&gt;&gt; getting there.\n&gt;&gt; Did you leave it somewhere?\n&gt;&gt; crash.\n&gt;&gt; I pulled I was No,\n&gt;&gt; I have it in a zip pocket. Yeah,\n&gt;&gt; I pulled it out to check the GoPro\nbattery and then to plug in a charger on\nthe GoPro, put it back in my pocket and\ndidn't zip.\n&gt;&gt; So, it's somewhere\nafter I stopped.\n&gt;&gt; Unfortunately, I can't\nunless somebody brings it in. I mean,\nI'm just saying it's gone cuz there's I\nmean, I have to go back over 12 miles of\ntrail to find it.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. For now, why don't you eat\nand uh drink something?\nLet me pull the GoPro footage and just\ncheck it out and see. I have to do that.\nSo, let's\n&gt;&gt; do that.\n&gt;&gt; And then hopefully somebody shows up\nwith a phone.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Let's not rush to conclusions\nbecause we're here till potentially\n10:30 tomorrow.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.
